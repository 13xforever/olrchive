WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:20.440
Tonight, March 19th, 2006, a barrage of updates on the PlayStation 3, we dispel April Fools

00:20.440 --> 00:24.640
rumors already hitting the internet, and do we really have to say goodbye to Katamari

00:24.640 --> 00:32.880
The Orange Lounge Radio.

00:32.880 --> 00:36.040
Welcome everybody to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.040 --> 00:39.780
We're here to give you the news that gamers really want to know about.

00:39.780 --> 00:40.780
My name is Rob Roberts.

00:40.780 --> 00:41.780
You might know me as Sky.

00:41.780 --> 00:45.720
Joining me as always, say hello to my awesome co-host, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:45.720 --> 00:46.720
Yo.

00:46.720 --> 00:47.720
How you doing?

00:47.720 --> 00:48.720
Full.

00:48.720 --> 00:49.720
Full?

00:49.720 --> 00:50.720
You just ate before the show?

00:50.720 --> 00:51.720
Yeah.

00:51.720 --> 00:52.720
I had my usual burrito.

00:52.720 --> 00:53.720
Awesome.

00:53.720 --> 00:58.480
What makes it a burrito of doom? Is it blessed by the Dark Lord Satan or what?

00:58.480 --> 01:03.400
I'm just kidding, I don't know. No, no, Satan decided not to bless my burrito.

01:03.400 --> 01:07.760
I see, all right. Also say hello to our tech master, Loki.

01:07.760 --> 01:09.120
Hello. How you doing?

01:09.120 --> 01:15.080
I'm good, I feel like a Got Milk commercial. I have all that chocolate from those brownie

01:15.080 --> 01:20.080
bites in my mouth. I know, that's like two weeks in a row that we've had those brownie bites here.

01:20.080 --> 01:23.040
I went to Starbucks to go buy them, but they only had two

01:24.600 --> 01:29.960
They're also out of white mocha, which I don't really care because I don't drink coffee

01:29.960 --> 01:34.120
But Nellie wanted a white mocha. So so you had to hear all that complaining

01:35.080 --> 01:38.600
No, and then I don't know. I don't like Starbucks

01:39.840 --> 01:44.000
What's that? Oh, yay brownie. Anyway, we're here on this episode number

01:44.000 --> 01:50.620
177 for this March 19th of 2006 and we got a lot of news to go into tonight so

01:50.620 --> 01:53.600
let's just start getting into the show we always started off talking about how

01:53.600 --> 01:57.700
our gaming week was the kinds of games we played this week little mini reviews

01:57.700 --> 02:02.220
on stuff we've looked into and just so you know that we're gamers too you know

02:02.220 --> 02:07.180
Dark Sakura what you've been doing this week um actually a lot of Animal

02:07.180 --> 02:11.380
Crossing again just because it's what I can play at work other the rest of my

02:11.380 --> 02:18.340
times been spent like doing school stuff um however um I uh my husband has told

02:18.340 --> 02:22.540
me that I'm getting a PSP of my very own soon because of a certain case that will

02:22.540 --> 02:28.380
be associated with a certain game what's this the for me and my katamari

02:28.380 --> 02:32.180
apparently there's a case being released that's in the shape of the prince's head

02:32.180 --> 02:35.980
oh I think I saw a picture of that somewhere I don't know if it was a

02:35.980 --> 02:39.100
custom thing or the official one I know I've seen a picture of a PSP well it's

02:39.100 --> 02:42.100
It's gotta be official if it's being shipped to GameStop.

02:42.100 --> 02:45.300
Well, I know, I know, but I'm wondering if the picture I saw was the official one or a fan,

02:45.300 --> 02:48.400
because you know fans probably did one, too, before that.

02:48.400 --> 02:53.700
But, uh, so, uh, he has told me in no uncertain terms I'm getting my own PSP.

02:53.700 --> 02:55.100
So that means I could probably give you yours back.

02:55.100 --> 02:56.600
Yeah, yeah, I'd like mine back any day now.

02:56.600 --> 02:57.800
No, you know what? I...

02:57.800 --> 03:01.500
There's, well, the only time I really need mine back is when me and my Katamari comes out,

03:01.500 --> 03:04.900
and there's a couple other games I want to check out, too, but honestly, guys,

03:04.900 --> 03:06.700
this week is all about the DS for me.

03:06.700 --> 03:09.920
And when we get into releases this week, I think you'll understand why.

03:09.920 --> 03:13.240
And a lot of you guys probably already know, but we'll talk about that later.

03:13.240 --> 03:16.540
Animal Crossing. I noticed a lot of people

03:16.540 --> 03:20.000
kinda left Animal Crossing for other DS games.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.680
Is Animal Crossing really the type of game you can kinda go back to, or is it

03:25.680 --> 03:29.080
kinda one of those games that once you stop playing it, it gets too tough to get back into again?

03:29.080 --> 03:31.840
I think you can pick it up at any time. You just have to be willing to do a lot of

03:31.840 --> 03:32.680
weeding and

03:32.680 --> 03:35.800
you know, kiss an ass of your town people.

03:35.800 --> 03:47.800
But I also found out, this is when I was at the doctor yesterday, I played a lot of Puzzle Fighter.

03:47.800 --> 03:50.800
A lot of Puzzle Fighter on my Game Boy Micro.

03:50.800 --> 03:53.800
Oh, right on, like the old school, yeah. I love Puzzle Fighter.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.800
I love street puzzle mode.

03:55.800 --> 03:59.800
I really haven't touched Puzzle Fighter in a long time. I never played the Game Boy one.

03:59.800 --> 04:01.800
There's no real differences from the PlayStation one, right? It's all the same?

04:01.800 --> 04:02.800
It's all the same.

04:02.800 --> 04:07.040
name. Actually I think it's slightly harder but then again I've been playing it on the

04:07.040 --> 04:12.380
Micro where it's like really really tiny. Yeah I see that's why I won't get a Micro

04:12.380 --> 04:20.320
because you know my eyesight's borderline bad enough. Mine was a gift. Puzzle Games,

04:20.320 --> 04:23.400
you know what Puzzle Game never really came out for a home console that kind of made me

04:23.400 --> 04:28.040
sad? They used to have this game at Golf Land Local Arcade, the Battle Balls, did you ever

04:28.040 --> 04:32.040
play that with the marbles that you had to stack like four in a row? I never played that.

04:32.040 --> 04:35.720
I was kind of fun it was it was an import game I know that Capcom game

04:35.720 --> 04:38.800
is it I don't know what about what about

04:38.800 --> 04:41.840
I'll shoot what was that one magical drop

04:41.840 --> 04:46.400
magical drop kinda have like a resurgence you can get on your phone I

04:46.400 --> 04:48.480
had magical drop on my cell phone go figure

04:48.480 --> 04:52.440
amazing I am course at magical drop on any a GSCD

04:52.440 --> 04:56.000
well I mean that's the way to do it if you wanna do it authentic but I'm

04:56.000 --> 04:58.200
pretty sure magical drop also existed

04:58.200 --> 05:02.100
I wanna say there was a version of it on Super Nintendo but please don't quote me

05:02.100 --> 05:02.400
on that.

05:02.400 --> 05:06.360
I thought that they did one actually for the Pocket. Did they get you a Pocket?

05:06.360 --> 05:10.680
Probably because it was an SNK game. For some reason I don't remember, I remember

05:10.680 --> 05:11.640
they did Cotton.

05:11.640 --> 05:16.160
Which is, actually I need to find my copy of it because I've been really

05:16.160 --> 05:20.040
getting back into some of my older gaming. We're actually hooking up the

05:20.040 --> 05:25.760
Turbo Duo so I can play Space Fantasy Zone

05:25.760 --> 05:29.800
that one of our listeners sent me.

05:29.800 --> 05:30.840
Lucky.

05:30.840 --> 05:32.880
Listeners don't send me gifts.

05:32.880 --> 05:35.240
Oh, in a way, that's totally not true.

05:35.240 --> 05:36.900
I totally just, they don't send me gifts,

05:36.900 --> 05:37.920
but I got one in person.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.920
I got a pretty big one in person not that long ago,

05:39.920 --> 05:41.800
so I can't say that.

05:41.800 --> 05:42.640
My bad.

05:42.640 --> 05:44.600
I also found a very interesting book.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.640
I was at Barnes and Noble last night,

05:48.640 --> 05:52.000
and there was a retro magazine that they did

05:52.000 --> 05:53.700
with the Super R-Type on the cover.

05:53.700 --> 05:54.540
I was like, yeah!

05:54.540 --> 05:56.540
They have like a gaming retro magazine?

05:56.540 --> 05:57.040
Yeah.

05:57.040 --> 05:58.540
That's kind of rad. I didn't know that.

05:58.540 --> 06:05.540
There's also another book that was something about writing and poetry spawned from old video games.

06:05.540 --> 06:09.540
It was one of the end cap books in the fantasy section that made me laugh.

06:09.540 --> 06:11.540
Haikus?

06:11.540 --> 06:13.040
I don't think it was a Haiku book.

06:13.040 --> 06:16.540
You know what we should have on orangehonestredo.com is a Haiku forum.

06:16.540 --> 06:22.900
Oh great video game how I love thee so much

06:22.900 --> 06:26.220
I play you all day. It's beautiful

06:26.220 --> 06:29.260
I was moved. It actually was right too.

06:29.260 --> 06:32.860
You guys, I saw your fingers tapping as you were talking

06:32.860 --> 06:36.740
That was good. Anything else you want to share about your week? Ouch.

06:36.740 --> 06:40.700
Alright. Loki, how was your gaming week? My week was okay

06:40.700 --> 06:44.740
I've been playing a lot of the Xbox stuff

06:44.740 --> 06:50.140
I bought the outfit and I played that for about half an hour, so that's kind of cool.

06:50.140 --> 06:54.340
I haven't really gotten the back to touch it, I've been trying to finish up getting

06:54.340 --> 07:01.420
the rest of my achievements in full auto and I have one left and that's rank 10 online.

07:01.420 --> 07:09.780
I just got my million, or was it a million, like was it a million points in just the game

07:09.780 --> 07:15.960
and then 100 no 1000 kills I got the achievement for that and they have rank

07:15.960 --> 07:20.800
9 I just did and then I just have ranked 10 online to do and I'm done the game

07:20.800 --> 07:23.920
what are achievement points to you are you an achievement point horror where

07:23.920 --> 07:28.880
you have to have like the as many as you possibly can yes and no I'm kind of that

07:28.880 --> 07:32.940
way too it's like I just want to get done at the game because I'm not really

07:32.940 --> 07:37.200
playing it too much anymore and it's just it's okay multiplayer but it's not

07:37.200 --> 07:42.420
that fun so I just want to get done with it so if I feel like selling it I know

07:42.420 --> 07:45.420
that I've milked all the achievement points out of it that I could possibly

07:45.420 --> 07:50.820
get so I'm kind of yes and no on the achievement points like if I see like

07:50.820 --> 07:56.100
for instance take take geometry Wars geometry Wars has an achievement point

07:56.100 --> 07:59.780
that you get like five or ten points I remember for what's called pacifism

07:59.780 --> 08:03.820
where you don't get hit by anything for seconds exactly I was kind of like okay

08:03.820 --> 08:08.540
normally I wouldn't play the game like that but okay if I get 10 points out of it I'll

08:08.540 --> 08:12.340
try it out and it actually is kind of tough I didn't get it my first try it was actually

08:12.340 --> 08:16.100
a bit of a challenge but you know I'll go out of my way for little things like that

08:16.100 --> 08:19.700
but I know people that like there was an article on the internet I don't remember if it was

08:19.700 --> 08:24.900
this week or last week but it was about how to get easily 6000 gamer points.

08:24.900 --> 08:26.340
It's all sports games.

08:26.340 --> 08:31.700
And I'm kind of like okay nah that's not cool I mean that's that's you know if that's the

08:31.700 --> 08:37.020
the way you're getting the gamers points then, you know, that means nothing when you look

08:37.020 --> 08:38.020
at the score.

08:38.020 --> 08:41.260
I mean, it's unfortunate that the score doesn't really tell you right away how the points

08:41.260 --> 08:43.800
were gotten, but I still really like the system.

08:43.800 --> 08:48.140
I think it's really kind of innovative, it's certainly different.

08:48.140 --> 08:52.420
But I've been playing, I did play a little bit of Geometry Wars, I did get the Pacifist

08:52.420 --> 08:59.280
achievement, which was a pain in the ass, and then I've only been able to get about

08:59.280 --> 09:02.640
100,000 and then I get blown up pretty quick.

09:02.640 --> 09:04.080
I really suck at Geometry Wars.

09:04.080 --> 09:08.640
There's too much flashy shit on the screen, and I've been wondering if I should try it

09:08.640 --> 09:11.300
in retro mode, if that'll make a difference, but...

09:11.300 --> 09:13.920
Your score won't rank, and it's just a different mode.

09:13.920 --> 09:17.560
I mean, I take it back, there is a ranking mode for it, but it's not the same one that

09:17.560 --> 09:19.520
the achievements unlock on.

09:19.520 --> 09:21.840
So if you want achievements, you gotta deal with it.

09:21.840 --> 09:25.200
It's just too flashy, like there's too many particles in there and stuff.

09:25.200 --> 09:28.760
I was actually reading an FAQ on the game, or I was looking on forums or something, I

09:28.760 --> 09:33.740
I might have actually been on the official Xbox forums looking for hints on how to play and people are saying like oh you should

09:33.740 --> 09:35.900
Be able to breeze through the first 500k easily

09:35.900 --> 09:36.520
I'm like okay

09:36.520 --> 09:42.040
Am I just old and my hand-eye coordination has gone way down or what because I really have a hard time breaking

09:42.260 --> 09:43.940
Like 200k on a regular basis

09:43.940 --> 09:47.180
Maybe I'm just like I read a tip that I thought was interesting and the tip

09:47.400 --> 09:52.060
Suggested that like if you're having a hard time with it you focus on your ship and nothing

09:52.060 --> 09:55.500
But the ship like you don't allow anything else on the screen to distract you except your ship

09:55.500 --> 10:00.500
so that way you're dodging no matter what and that will help you get through

10:00.500 --> 10:04.020
like at least like if they say the first 500k or million or something like that

10:04.020 --> 10:07.180
but then after that you really do have to use your peripheral vision because I

10:07.180 --> 10:10.900
guess things just start bombarding you like crazy but that'll at least help you

10:10.900 --> 10:14.780
if you're struggling in the beginning like I am like you are so I don't know

10:14.780 --> 10:18.500
and then I was playing feeding frenzy and the thing I like about this and the

10:18.500 --> 10:22.940
fact the way the achievements are is it's a game where say I beat ten levels

10:22.940 --> 10:28.280
of it, I can start it back later and play starting from level 10 and keep going on.

10:28.280 --> 10:34.800
So it makes achievements really simple on it, and plus it's a pretty simple game actually.

10:34.800 --> 10:39.120
And that's the one where you start off as a small fish and eat your way up until you

10:39.120 --> 10:41.180
become bigger enough to eat the larger fish.

10:41.180 --> 10:45.120
I've played a game exactly like that at Dave & Buster's except it gave you tickets.

10:45.120 --> 10:49.560
And I have to say tickets are a little cooler than the achievement points because tickets

10:49.560 --> 10:52.720
I can trade in for stuffed animals, which is cool.

10:52.720 --> 10:57.300
I'm just waiting for like when they come up with something on Xbox Live that you can only

10:57.300 --> 11:00.840
access it if you have X amount of achievement points or something like that.

11:00.840 --> 11:04.720
I think that would be kind of neat if they, like it doesn't necessarily have to be like

11:04.720 --> 11:10.200
a game but like something like a, maybe like a beta only open to hardcore players who got

11:10.200 --> 11:14.340
a certain amount of achievement points on something or you know maybe one of these deals

11:14.340 --> 11:20.940
but the problem is, is that it's these articles like the how to get 6000 gamers points easily

11:20.940 --> 11:24.440
are going to kind of screw that up and unfortunately some games the achievement points are way

11:24.440 --> 11:25.820
easier to get than others.

11:25.820 --> 11:31.540
For instance, going with Xbox Live Arcade, Crystal Quest compared to Bejeweled, Bejeweled

11:31.540 --> 11:36.680
you have to play hardcore because all the achievements practically are like astronomical

11:36.680 --> 11:38.260
numbers of rounds and points.

11:38.260 --> 11:42.980
Whereas Crystal Quest, if you get pretty good at it, you'll only have to play through one

11:42.980 --> 11:46.900
or two times to really unlock the bulk of achievement points.

11:46.900 --> 11:50.260
have to spend time with it for the others but I mean could put the two

11:50.260 --> 11:55.380
games side by side and you know it's much easier to get it in the one I don't

11:55.380 --> 11:58.220
know but other than that I've been playing a little bit burnout a little

11:58.220 --> 12:05.380
bit of full auto of course the outfit as they mentioned and I think that's pretty

12:05.380 --> 12:08.620
much it just been kind of bouncing around from those in a little bit of

12:08.620 --> 12:13.660
Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories of course and god I think there was another

12:13.660 --> 12:17.580
of the game in there too. Oh, I actually played The Simpsons on my MAME cabinet for a little

12:17.580 --> 12:20.420
bit. Yeah, that's about it.

12:20.420 --> 12:22.500
Alright, awesome. Yes, Star Chakra?

12:22.500 --> 12:23.500
Nothing.

12:23.500 --> 12:27.500
Oh, I thought you had a thought, because you reached for your mic suddenly. I thought maybe-

12:27.500 --> 12:29.100
I thought it was going to fall.

12:29.100 --> 12:33.180
You know what it might be, is that you're getting ready to scold me for my gaming week?

12:33.180 --> 12:34.700
Oh no, what'd you do?

12:34.700 --> 12:38.860
I spent the majority of my gaming week playing Final Fantasy XI.

12:38.860 --> 12:42.980
Addict! That's okay, I went back to Ragnarok online.

12:42.980 --> 12:44.980
Alright, so we're even.

12:44.980 --> 12:47.980
Yeah, so I've been playing Final Fantasy XI starting over from scratch.

12:47.980 --> 12:50.980
And I think I mentioned on the last podcast I was going to do this.

12:50.980 --> 12:53.980
Well, I've actually been in the habit of doing it this week and playing.

12:53.980 --> 12:55.980
I'm already up to level 9, yes!

12:55.980 --> 12:59.980
And soon I'll be level 30 and be all ready for the expansion pack when it comes out.

12:59.980 --> 13:03.980
Because the expansion pack definitely looks like it's going to be worth a try.

13:03.980 --> 13:07.980
They're incorporating elements of older Final Fantasies and stuff into it, which is kind of neat.

13:07.980 --> 13:09.980
Like somebody pointed out to me in the trailer,

13:09.980 --> 13:14.620
see one of the judges from Final Fantasy Tactics and stuff in it, so I think that's kind of neat,

13:14.620 --> 13:19.420
so we'll see what happens with that. I am interested in some of the new classes. I'm

13:19.420 --> 13:24.220
prepping my little Taru because I reincarnated myself as a Taru. I said I'm doing an absolute

13:24.220 --> 13:28.780
clean start. New server, so I can't get any of the same help I had before, new character,

13:28.780 --> 13:33.260
new everything, so I reincarnated myself as a little Taru Taru, so I plan on being a blue mage,

13:33.260 --> 13:36.380
but the problem is that everybody's going to be a blue mage when that thing rolls out.

13:36.380 --> 13:37.900
I remember Lil' Kim.

13:37.900 --> 13:43.100
Lil' Kim was my mule on my old server, and she was a Tarou as well, so...

13:43.100 --> 13:47.980
I'll tell you the name of my new character off-air, but I will say I play on the Seraph server now,

13:47.980 --> 13:53.100
so I'm watching you guys, Seraph server. I'll talk smack about you on the show if you wrong me.

13:53.100 --> 13:56.860
I'll tell you my character name off-air, because it's really cool, so... I just don't want to get...

13:56.860 --> 14:01.740
You actually reminded me that I did forget to say that I'm on a free server for Ragnarok.

14:01.740 --> 14:04.620
What ever happened with, like, the legality of that? Isn't that kind of a gray area?

14:04.620 --> 14:06.620
I don't think Gravity cares anymore.

14:06.620 --> 14:07.120
Really?

14:07.120 --> 14:08.620
As long as they're making money, huh?

14:08.620 --> 14:12.120
The server that I'm playing on is super dedicated.

14:12.120 --> 14:16.620
I mean, it's like, it's so much better than playing on, like, IRO.

14:16.620 --> 14:18.620
I've never had any problem.

14:18.620 --> 14:20.620
It's been really great.

14:22.620 --> 14:27.120
As far as the rest of my gaming week, I also was playing quite a bit of Xbox Live Arcade.

14:27.120 --> 14:28.620
I checked out Jewel Quest.

14:28.620 --> 14:33.620
I actually bought Jewel Quest because I, you know, I knew it was kind of like Bejeweled and I like Bejeweled.

14:33.620 --> 14:37.340
so I bought it. My problem with Jewel Quest is that it's

14:37.340 --> 14:40.660
too much like Bejeweled, like I didn't... I don't know, for some reason I just...

14:40.660 --> 14:44.340
you know, it's so easy to spend like five bucks on those crap little games

14:44.340 --> 14:44.860
sometimes

14:44.860 --> 14:48.580
and, you know, I bought it and then I realized this really is just the same

14:48.580 --> 14:50.460
damn thing as Bejeweled, but I'll tell you this,

14:50.460 --> 14:53.340
I don't think Jewel Quest is put together as nicely as they put together

14:53.340 --> 14:54.620
Bejeweled on Xbox Live.

14:54.620 --> 14:58.780
Have you played either one or both? No. Bejeweled is really polished

14:58.780 --> 15:02.500
and looks really nice and uses the high def. Jewel Quest seems to have

15:02.500 --> 15:03.600
frame rate issues.

15:03.600 --> 15:08.000
The achievement points are certainly easier but honestly I'm not really

15:08.000 --> 15:09.640
considering that in my review of the game.

15:09.640 --> 15:14.000
I put the game side by side. I definitely prefer Bejeweled. I think it's got

15:14.000 --> 15:17.160
some more modes. I think it's just more polished looking when you consider that

15:17.160 --> 15:18.800
they're essentially the same game.

15:18.800 --> 15:22.720
I mean not really. Jewel Quest is about not how many

15:22.720 --> 15:25.960
three in a row you connect but where you get them on the board and it kind of

15:25.960 --> 15:28.400
influences your strategy a little bit but really

15:28.400 --> 15:32.320
they play very similarly. I do recommend Bejeweled over Jewel Quest.

15:32.320 --> 15:35.560
even if the achievement points are harder, it's a game with better music,

15:35.560 --> 15:39.920
better graphics, and I think I like the presentation a little more

15:39.920 --> 15:40.440
in Bejeweled.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.800
And when the game themselves are very similar, it's all about the presentation.

15:43.800 --> 15:49.280
I want Tetris. I don't know if that would happen, because Nintendo owns

15:49.280 --> 15:53.000
rights to Tetris in America. They have Tetris Grandmaster that came out for the

15:53.000 --> 15:56.480
Japanese launch. It's a really extremely retarded game.

15:56.480 --> 16:00.880
I think it would be better as an Xbox Live Arcade game. What does Nintendo own the rights to

16:00.880 --> 16:06.040
when it comes to Tetris then, because remember when it got into Nintendo vs. Tengen Tetris?

16:06.040 --> 16:08.920
Oh, but those were both on the NES, too, I guess.

16:08.920 --> 16:09.920
Maybe that's what it has to do with.

16:09.920 --> 16:14.160
I don't think they own the rights to Tetris, to be honest, because, I mean, we've seen

16:14.160 --> 16:16.880
Tetris Worlds and stuff on the PlayStation.

16:16.880 --> 16:19.840
Maybe they own the exclusive rights for their own systems or something, because you notice

16:19.840 --> 16:22.960
all the Tetris games that come out on Nintendo systems are Nintendo games.

16:22.960 --> 16:26.880
Like this new DS one that's coming out is a Nintendo game, the old Game Boy one.

16:26.880 --> 16:27.880
I don't know.

16:27.880 --> 16:28.880
I don't know.

16:28.880 --> 16:30.920
Somebody in the chat room knows, I don't know.

16:30.920 --> 16:34.840
That's OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on chat if you want to share some information with

16:34.840 --> 16:39.560
us or of course you can always drop us an email as well, mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

16:39.560 --> 16:41.640
Let's get into some gaming news for tonight.

16:41.640 --> 16:44.840
Let's start it off, I think a lot of us might have something to contribute here with the

16:44.840 --> 16:49.220
PlayStation 3, obviously they had that huge press conference earlier this week.

16:49.220 --> 16:53.080
Probably most of you guys on the internet have read it by now, but we have to talk about

16:53.080 --> 16:54.080
it anyway.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.080
Certainly we want to give our input.

16:55.080 --> 16:58.600
Loki, start us off with a summary, what did we find out about after this conference this

16:58.600 --> 17:03.200
While they announce a few things about both the PlayStation 3 and PSP, let's start off

17:03.200 --> 17:04.840
with the PlayStation 3.

17:04.840 --> 17:07.480
Of course, it's going to be launched in November.

17:07.480 --> 17:12.840
I think that was only news to Sony because everyone else figured that it was going to

17:12.840 --> 17:13.840
be November.

17:13.840 --> 17:17.840
Well, it's nice to hear them actually confirm it because I think most of us were thinking

17:17.840 --> 17:19.680
it was going to be 2007 at this point.

17:19.680 --> 17:23.680
Well, I'm not confirming it and saying that they're actually going to make it in November

17:23.680 --> 17:30.680
because I mean, after all, Microsoft did say they were going to ship three million units

17:30.680 --> 17:34.420
by the three month mark, and that never happened.

17:34.420 --> 17:37.400
I credit Sony with a little bit more brains than Microsoft.

17:37.400 --> 17:39.000
Well, we'll see.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.140
I don't know about that.

17:41.140 --> 17:43.560
You know what's interesting is that I was reading a separate article this week that

17:43.560 --> 17:47.040
talked about the launch of the Sega Saturn, and when they launched that, it was like a

17:47.040 --> 17:50.620
surprise announcement at E3, it was one of those things that was like, we're not telling

17:50.620 --> 17:53.440
you to wait until November, it's on shelves today.

17:53.440 --> 17:56.240
And I think that's kind of cool, but at the same time, it also kind of killed the system

17:56.240 --> 17:59.060
because with the surprise announcement, there wasn't enough time for all the developers

17:59.060 --> 18:03.340
to get the games out, so, I mean, it's kind of a double-edged sword there.

18:03.340 --> 18:08.760
What killed the system, what killed the Saturn was Sega's whole marketing ploy.

18:08.760 --> 18:12.960
The Saturn did very well in Japan, and it had much better games that we never saw, that

18:12.960 --> 18:14.480
never saw the light of day in the US.

18:14.480 --> 18:15.480
True.

18:15.480 --> 18:16.480
And it was very import-friendly.

18:16.480 --> 18:17.480
True.

18:17.480 --> 18:18.480
True.

18:18.480 --> 18:19.480
So that's what killed the Saturn.

18:19.480 --> 18:20.480
Anyway, sorry, this isn't about Sega.

18:20.480 --> 18:21.480
It's about Sony.

18:21.480 --> 18:22.480
Anyway, moving on.

18:22.480 --> 18:28.360
It's going to be released somewhere in the first 10-11 days of November.

18:28.360 --> 18:30.280
So the early part of November there.

18:30.280 --> 18:37.380
And it's going to be including a 60 gigabyte hard drive pre-installed with Linux.

18:37.380 --> 18:38.380
So ha!

18:38.380 --> 18:39.380
They beat the...

18:39.380 --> 18:42.460
I think that's kind of funny is that they've kind of just given in to the fact that somebody's

18:42.460 --> 18:44.600
going to install Linux on this anyway, so here you go.

18:44.600 --> 18:45.600
And it's going to be us.

18:45.600 --> 18:49.080
Anyways, so I thought that was funny.

18:49.080 --> 18:55.480
They're going to have, what was it, of course Blu-Ray is going to be the standard for all

18:55.480 --> 18:59.360
the games on the system, not going to see any DVD games for it, which I thought was

18:59.360 --> 19:00.360
kind of interesting.

19:00.360 --> 19:02.400
Because they don't want them pirated.

19:02.400 --> 19:10.360
Yes, at minimum it will be no less than 50,000 yen, or $425 US.

19:10.360 --> 19:13.160
Do you believe the $900 price point people are saying?

19:13.160 --> 19:14.340
That's full of crap.

19:14.340 --> 19:17.280
It has to be full of crap, and I'm sorry to you guys in chat room that are yelling the

19:17.280 --> 19:22.320
$900 thing right now, but, honestly, come on, Sony's gotta know better than that, they

19:22.320 --> 19:23.320
know that will be suicide.

19:23.320 --> 19:27.040
You have to understand this, it might be $900 if you bought the system for what it's actually

19:27.040 --> 19:31.400
worth, but you know everyone sells systems at a loss, so Sony's gonna have to be prepared

19:31.400 --> 19:33.640
to take a hell of a loss on these, it's gonna be interesting.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.360
Gotta lose money to make money.

19:35.360 --> 19:41.000
Yeah, I mean, the whole thing was with the Blu-ray drive and that's what half the cost

19:41.000 --> 19:49.880
Oh well, it's going to be fully backwards compatible with all PlayStation and PlayStation

19:49.880 --> 19:50.880
2 titles.

19:50.880 --> 19:51.880
Bravo, smart move.

19:51.880 --> 19:55.520
And they're going to basically upscale all of them like the 360 does with the games.

19:55.520 --> 19:59.280
That was one of the most exciting announcements to me, honestly.

19:59.280 --> 20:05.200
Also they're going to be digitally distributing PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 games to the

20:05.200 --> 20:06.200
console.

20:06.200 --> 20:10.720
I don't want to say I told you so, but I could swear we had a discussion just a couple weeks

20:10.720 --> 20:14.960
to go about digital distribution and how it was kind of where the industry was moving

20:14.960 --> 20:18.560
and hello, here we go, here's the proof.

20:18.560 --> 20:19.560
Exactly.

20:19.560 --> 20:27.380
And the final PS3 development kits are being sent to developers in June, so that should

20:27.380 --> 20:28.380
be interesting.

20:28.380 --> 20:32.180
Some of the other things I heard about, they're going to have of course the PlayStation Hub

20:32.180 --> 20:38.120
service which is going to be for both the PlayStation Portable and the PS3 as well as

20:38.120 --> 20:44.400
What's kind of neat about that is it will be free to play multiplayer games, but there's

20:44.400 --> 20:48.480
going to be additional content on there that will cost money and they'll have subscription

20:48.480 --> 20:51.080
services for that type of stuff.

20:51.080 --> 20:58.700
The servers will not be a central server like Microsoft, they will be separate, each run

20:58.700 --> 21:00.640
by different companies.

21:00.640 --> 21:04.640
But you'll have this central hub that you'll be able to tie into, kind of like Xbox Live.

21:04.640 --> 21:09.440
So it's both like it is now and both like, you know, kind of how Microsoft does their

21:09.440 --> 21:10.440
servers.

21:10.440 --> 21:11.440
Huh.

21:11.440 --> 21:12.440
That's interesting.

21:12.440 --> 21:13.640
Which is different, I guess.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.280
Comments from chat room real fast, OrangeOrangeReady.com, click on chat.

21:16.280 --> 21:19.360
Spirit Snare says, I think they're probably aiming for $550-ish.

21:19.360 --> 21:22.120
$550 is a little more reasonable.

21:22.120 --> 21:27.720
Honestly, if I were to make a prediction, I would say to compete with Microsoft, they

21:27.720 --> 21:29.160
got to do one of two things.

21:29.160 --> 21:32.680
They really have to release this system for $399, just like the Xbox.

21:32.680 --> 21:34.080
It's not going to be less than $400.

21:34.080 --> 21:37.920
Yeah, but they're flat out saying it's not going to be less than $400, so I'm thinking

21:37.920 --> 21:42.040
that they're going to have to release, I think the price point will be $499 is my guess,

21:42.040 --> 21:46.140
and of course I don't know shit, but $499 is my guess, but they're really going to emphasize

21:46.140 --> 21:51.800
Blu-ray, this will play movies in high-death, and they're going to say you need this, and

21:51.800 --> 21:55.360
they're going to really emphasize those things that that system can do that Xbox 360 doesn't

21:55.360 --> 21:56.360
do.

21:56.360 --> 21:57.360
What they need to do.

21:57.360 --> 22:00.320
And I think you're going to see them throw in a bonus movie, like a free, like you remember

22:00.320 --> 22:05.080
when PSP came out they gave Spider-Man 2 free. I bet you anything there's going to be a tie-in

22:05.080 --> 22:09.880
where the first few Playstation Soul will come with a free Blu-ray movie. Whatever Sony's

22:09.880 --> 22:12.640
big summer picture is will be the tie-in movie.

22:12.640 --> 22:16.280
What they need to do is they need to have the system, they need to emphasize the fact

22:16.280 --> 22:20.280
that you don't have to go out and buy all these additional peripherals and crap that

22:20.280 --> 22:24.840
you have to do with the 360. Oh, I got a system! Oh, wait, now I got controllers. Oh, each

22:24.840 --> 22:29.000
one of those are $40 each. Oh, I have to buy the right cables for my TV. By the way, those

22:29.000 --> 22:33.980
are also $40 each. Now, oh, I didn't get a remote with mine. Oh, guess what, that's

22:33.980 --> 22:38.360
$40 also. Yeah, it all adds up, you know, in the end. And by the way, those controllers,

22:38.360 --> 22:41.600
how much does it cost Microsoft to make them? Oh yeah, it was like $10 or something.

22:41.600 --> 22:42.720
Interesting way to look at it.

22:42.720 --> 22:46.240
So, they're making their money back in peripherals. That's where all the money is.

22:46.240 --> 22:47.760
Wait, isn't Spider-Man 3 this summer?

22:47.760 --> 22:49.600
No, Spider-Man 3 is next summer.

22:49.600 --> 22:49.960
Oh, okay.

22:49.960 --> 22:54.760
Do you think we've just made a good point to give Advent Children as the free movie?

22:54.760 --> 22:58.200
But would they be able to do that when it's really Square's movie?

22:58.200 --> 23:01.140
I mean that's certainly a lot of fanboys would love to see that. Square's in Sony's bed.

23:01.140 --> 23:06.120
I guess that's true. You never know. I'll be hot.

23:06.120 --> 23:09.800
That would be. Anyways, certainly make it more attractive.

23:09.800 --> 23:14.280
Now, the other things of course they were talking about was the PSP

23:14.280 --> 23:18.000
and some of the stuff that's not much of a surprise. We knew that there was going

23:18.000 --> 23:20.600
to be an iToy peripheral coming, a webcam type thing.

23:20.600 --> 23:25.720
That's going to be coming I believe it was September was the

23:25.720 --> 23:30.520
announced date for that and then of course GPS is coming on later in the

23:30.520 --> 23:33.760
year probably in the third or fourth quarter.

23:33.760 --> 23:37.440
Then of course with the iToy type of

23:37.440 --> 23:40.720
peripheral on there they're going to be adding video phone support

23:40.720 --> 23:44.320
in the fall. One of the other things that was kind of interesting

23:44.320 --> 23:48.600
they did announce that there was going to be a core pack that's going to be a

23:48.600 --> 23:49.560
reduced price

23:49.560 --> 23:54.100
PSP. Basically, you're just getting the bare bones stuff, you're not getting a case, no

23:54.100 --> 23:58.920
headphones, which, to be honest, the case and headphones kind of sucked anyways, so

23:58.920 --> 24:06.540
save 50 bucks. And they're going to be releasing a ceramic white PSP core pack as well, which

24:06.540 --> 24:12.380
is going to be pretty cool. I think that's Japan only for the white one. What is interesting

24:12.380 --> 24:18.740
though is they're going to be offering an official PlayStation 1 emulator for the PSP.

24:18.740 --> 24:24.640
And you'll be able to digitally download these straight off the internet to your PSP.

24:24.640 --> 24:30.700
And I think this is where the 4GB NAND Flash PSP comes into play, where you'll be storing

24:30.700 --> 24:33.000
these on your memory stick.

24:33.000 --> 24:37.860
And I don't understand how these aren't going to be pirated from memory sticks, but I don't

24:37.860 --> 24:38.860
know.

24:38.860 --> 24:41.500
They're going to find a way I'm sure.

24:41.500 --> 24:50.140
And of course, with the next update, the web browser will get Flash 6.0 support, so it

24:50.140 --> 24:51.660
will be able to view most web pages.

24:51.660 --> 24:53.580
We'll have to put some on our PSP site.

24:53.580 --> 24:59.740
True, true, and also they're going to be able to record streaming audio.

24:59.740 --> 25:02.100
Well that's cool.

25:02.100 --> 25:05.740
You know what's interesting about the PSP to me is that they're really trying to think

25:05.740 --> 25:12.400
of things that the DS hasn't done yet, like to really sell the system more as not a game

25:12.400 --> 25:17.880
system but as a personal entertainment system, let's put it that way.

25:17.880 --> 25:23.080
Like with the whole itoy support, being able to do the short videos and these exchanges

25:23.080 --> 25:27.080
over the internet and stuff with the old games, I think they're really trying to think of

25:27.080 --> 25:31.600
the things, and the web support too, like things that the DS really hasn't done yet,

25:31.600 --> 25:35.200
Of course, most of the DS's innovations have been about the games itself, which, don't

25:35.200 --> 25:38.600
get me wrong, have been great, but I think PSP, you really see it trying to solidify

25:38.600 --> 25:41.760
itself as the more entertainment system as opposed to the game system.

25:41.760 --> 25:46.840
Well, what's interesting with the GPS thing is it is going to be available.

25:46.840 --> 25:50.160
One of the first games it's going to use is a new Hot Shots game coming out, which I thought

25:50.160 --> 25:51.880
was interesting.

25:51.880 --> 25:56.960
But apparently there's current games in the library right now that support it, but just,

25:56.960 --> 25:59.400
you know, it hasn't been unlocked yet or whatever.

25:59.400 --> 26:06.400
Uh, gs191 has a good comment in chatroom. Oh great, fucking Flash ads on my PSP.

26:06.820 --> 26:11.080
Hey, I'm gonna tell you this much though. What I've been waiting for is Flash for the

26:11.080 --> 26:12.800
website because

26:12.800 --> 26:18.120
you can do a live 365 player in Flash and that's good.

26:18.120 --> 26:20.200
Because you can listen to our show on the go.

26:20.200 --> 26:23.400
That would be good.

26:23.400 --> 26:28.120
What ever happened to the days when video game systems played video games?

26:28.120 --> 26:31.840
Well, the PSP does play games, and they've certainly got a lot of good games coming out

26:31.840 --> 26:36.600
this first quarter of this year, but I don't know, I think we're seeing this trend with

26:36.600 --> 26:42.420
all the next-gen systems, that they don't want to be just the game system.

26:42.420 --> 26:45.600
They want to be that centerpiece in your living room, and I think that's what we've heard

26:45.600 --> 26:47.100
in a lot of press conferences, too.

26:47.100 --> 26:52.020
They want to be the place where you can download movies, and look at Xbox 360, just released

26:52.020 --> 26:53.520
this week on Xbox Live.

26:53.520 --> 26:55.760
You can download a music video now for free.

26:55.760 --> 27:00.960
So it's kind of like, you know, they're really, I don't think it's all necessarily about the

27:00.960 --> 27:01.960
games anymore.

27:01.960 --> 27:04.200
That is why I love my DS.

27:04.200 --> 27:08.600
Why the only time, the only thing that PSP has ever been useful to me for is actually

27:08.600 --> 27:11.720
just watching movies on the airplane, because I've watched Hellboy.

27:11.720 --> 27:13.040
But Luminous is cool.

27:13.040 --> 27:14.560
Luminous is good.

27:14.560 --> 27:21.200
I haven't really played much else on the PSP that I really like other than that and Popolacross.

27:21.200 --> 27:24.280
if I want if I wanna play a game I'm gonna play

27:24.280 --> 27:30.160
a system dedicated to the game by a company dedicated to gameplay

27:30.160 --> 27:33.720
I don't care what it looks like as long as it's fun

27:33.720 --> 27:38.200
I you know it's sad

27:38.200 --> 27:42.600
it's very it's sad. So you think people's focus aren't on the games themselves?

27:42.600 --> 27:46.720
I remember the Odyssey 2. Right. That

27:46.720 --> 27:50.360
crap came out when I was two years old. Right. I remember watching the little

27:50.360 --> 27:56.520
blips on the screen and thinking that it was so much fun and just seeing the way that games

27:56.520 --> 28:01.760
are going now you know the systems especially just sort of is heartbreaking you know it's

28:01.760 --> 28:07.560
very sad very sad that people can't be satisfied with good gameplay we'll see we'll see all

28:07.560 --> 28:13.760
right um moving on anything else you want to share on the sony there loki um i was just

28:13.760 --> 28:18.160
trying to think some of the interesting thought our thoughts about it um they did mention

28:18.160 --> 28:23.640
I think it was the PSP web camera, their itoy, I guess they're calling it.

28:23.640 --> 28:30.840
It's gonna be, they're calling it like PSP 290 or something and I figured okay well firmware

28:30.840 --> 28:33.720
2.9 then is gonna support this or something like that.

28:33.720 --> 28:39.840
It was just kind of the, I guess their item code or whatever for it kind of tied in with

28:39.840 --> 28:43.280
the firmware that will support it.

28:43.280 --> 28:44.280
I think it's a good thing.

28:44.280 --> 28:48.280
I'm glad to see some cool peripherals and stuff come out.

28:48.280 --> 28:53.280
I was hoping that that web camera or iToy can be used as a digital camera.

28:53.280 --> 28:55.280
I hope it's good enough for that.

28:55.280 --> 28:57.280
I think it will.

28:57.280 --> 29:00.280
The only thing I don't understand is how the fuck are you going to use it as an iToy?

29:00.280 --> 29:02.280
Seriously, are you going to be flailing around?

29:02.280 --> 29:04.280
It's not going to work like that.

29:04.280 --> 29:08.280
I don't know. I think it's more like what you're saying there.

29:08.280 --> 29:11.280
I think it's going to be more for chatting and for picture taking.

29:11.280 --> 29:15.140
You know why why not for if the PSP is gonna be a little entertainment in a box

29:15.140 --> 29:18.260
Why not be digital camera as well? You know people like digital cameras

29:19.440 --> 29:22.520
People like cell phones that play music and have iTunes on

29:23.240 --> 29:25.120
fucking dumbasses

29:25.120 --> 29:27.580
Alright, let's go on to some other news this week

29:28.120 --> 29:35.240
Let's get into some news about a very popular PlayStation game this one being on the ps2 right Loki Final Fantasy 12

29:35.240 --> 29:40.440
12 god damn we've been waiting for that for a long time of course if you're in

29:40.440 --> 29:45.520
Japan you're already playing it and it's awesome but if you're looking for it in

29:45.520 --> 29:49.880
the u.s. you're gonna have to wait until Thanksgiving that's when it's coming

29:49.880 --> 29:54.520
out I've heard and fattened fantastic reviews on this game of course we

29:54.520 --> 29:58.640
mentioned for me to magazine last week but I'm very excited about 5-12 and

29:58.640 --> 30:01.880
wish I wish it wouldn't take him some damn long to release it here I'm still

30:01.880 --> 30:05.480
laughing about the potion commercial I haven't seen that yet I know somebody

30:05.480 --> 30:11.480
posted I have a friend who lives in Japan right now who said I guess she

30:11.480 --> 30:17.080
thinks it's tasty I'm looking forward to the game I love the battle system I know

30:17.080 --> 30:20.640
a lot of people have acted really weird about it but being the addict I am with

30:20.640 --> 30:24.480
Final Fantasy 11 I think it's a great combination of 11 and the old-school

30:24.480 --> 30:27.200
Final Fantasies I'm looking forward to trying it out if it plays anything like

30:27.200 --> 30:31.160
11 I'll guarantee I won't play it well it doesn't play like yeah thank God

30:31.160 --> 30:36.360
Because you don't have to spend an hour looking for a party. You're it's already there. It's part of the story to be honest

30:36.360 --> 30:39.080
No, I don't like the gameplay in 11, which is part of my

30:39.800 --> 30:45.680
be honest, it reminds me of a cross between Final Fantasy like x2 or X and and

30:46.640 --> 30:48.000
10

30:48.000 --> 30:50.400
Final Fantasy X and x2 and

30:51.120 --> 30:52.560
I

30:52.560 --> 30:54.160
Just like doing that

30:54.160 --> 30:56.360
In parasite Eve, I mean parasite Eve

30:56.360 --> 30:59.860
it reminds me of the battle system where they did that where you've got this sphere

30:59.860 --> 31:04.240
where you can attack. Basically it's just you can run around and do shit

31:04.240 --> 31:07.640
but it's still like kind of an active time battle system.

31:07.640 --> 31:11.640
Yeah, kinda. Alright so we'll be looking forward to

31:11.640 --> 31:14.920
Final Fantasy XII coming out very soon. Now

31:14.920 --> 31:18.480
the Nintendo Revolution has some rumors going around about it this week and the

31:18.480 --> 31:20.400
rumor is that it's coming out in June.

31:20.400 --> 31:25.280
Let's see, it was being told to Business Week.

31:25.280 --> 31:29.540
The quote was, there are rumors that the revolution could be released as early as

31:29.540 --> 31:30.280
June.

31:30.280 --> 31:33.640
If that happens and Nintendo sells around 1 million units,

31:33.640 --> 31:37.080
Sony could have a harder time catching up. And

31:37.080 --> 31:41.460
that quote comes from Akitaro Ito from Japan's game tracking service

31:41.460 --> 31:46.040
Media Create. Now of course when you look at the reality of it, the chance of

31:46.040 --> 31:48.400
the console actually coming out in June

31:48.400 --> 31:52.200
probably not going to happen and the reason why is because the development

31:52.200 --> 31:54.640
hardware is not out there right now so if that's not out

31:54.640 --> 31:58.640
it's gonna be very hard for the games to be out by June so probably

31:58.640 --> 32:03.560
November is more realistic time frame and Nintendo's also been kinda quoted

32:03.560 --> 32:07.280
recently saying Thanksgiving week of 2006 so

32:07.280 --> 32:10.520
I don't think there really is gonna be any June surprise in store so

32:10.520 --> 32:11.760
nothing like that whole

32:11.760 --> 32:15.800
Sega thing we were talking about earlier where they surprise us at E3. Not likely

32:15.800 --> 32:20.640
sorry to say. Moving on, something that works for Nintendo, Miyamoto

32:20.640 --> 32:24.600
yes Miyamoto reacted to the PlayStation 3 announcement

32:24.600 --> 32:30.340
this week. Not too surprising the way he reacted is basically

32:30.340 --> 32:34.560
you know kind of put a quote out there that's saying you know

32:34.560 --> 32:38.600
people are kinda getting tired of the same old video games nowadays

32:38.600 --> 32:43.720
and what these you know like Microsoft and Sony are doing for video games as

32:43.720 --> 32:46.680
far as they're improving the graphics but they're not really changing the

32:46.680 --> 32:47.960
gameplay any

32:47.960 --> 32:53.080
and so he's not too worried just because they've never really seen the other

32:53.080 --> 32:57.260
companies as competition because they're kind of in their own boat basically is

32:57.260 --> 32:58.760
being innovative

32:58.760 --> 33:01.860
whereas you know these guys are just pushing graphics and stuff

33:01.860 --> 33:05.560
you're not really pushing better gameplay

33:05.560 --> 33:08.900
well I'm not surprised to hear that coming from Miyamoto not at all

33:08.900 --> 33:12.220
it's just you know I I have to agree

33:12.220 --> 33:15.380
I mean games aren't really that much better

33:15.380 --> 33:18.780
they look at what Jamie was saying it looks prettier but they're not different I mean

33:18.780 --> 33:22.820
look at like in a personal stance just looking at like sales like a

33:22.820 --> 33:27.340
of different games out there. When I'm selling to customers and stuff, you know, it's like

33:27.340 --> 33:31.280
everything. Oh yeah, this is like Grand Theft Auto. Yeah, this is like Grand Theft Auto.

33:31.280 --> 33:35.480
This is like Grand Theft Auto. Oh yeah, this is Grand Theft Auto. It's just everything

33:35.480 --> 33:38.560
is very similar to one another and they're all copying off each other and there's not

33:38.560 --> 33:43.280
really anything innovative. And those games that are innovative do stand out, like Shadow

33:43.280 --> 33:47.760
Colossus, Katamari Damacy, and stuff like that.

33:47.760 --> 33:52.600
I have to ask Jamie having said that a little bit ago about the you know it's

33:52.600 --> 33:56.400
sad that the systems are kind of leaning towards being all one. Does this strike

33:56.400 --> 34:00.400
you as Nintendo being committed to the games?

34:00.400 --> 34:07.240
yeah I mean that's always what they've been about you know why why would they

34:07.240 --> 34:12.640
ever change their stance for the sake of following with the the same cookie

34:12.640 --> 34:15.840
cutter that everybody else is on. They have released some real odd things in the

34:15.840 --> 34:17.640
like I think about the Game Boy printer

34:17.640 --> 34:21.440
what the hell was that? That was funny. And the e-reader?

34:21.440 --> 34:24.440
The e-reader was a good idea. Yeah but it just

34:24.440 --> 34:27.800
good idea didn't really work out though I don't think. But you know what? At least they tried

34:27.800 --> 34:30.800
and I would rather see them try and fail at it than

34:30.800 --> 34:35.160
not see them try at all. They try to be innovative. They're not afraid to innovate. I mean look at the Virtual Boy

34:35.160 --> 34:38.240
dumb idea but you know what? It's a step in the right direction. The great

34:38.240 --> 34:39.120
mining machine.

34:39.120 --> 34:43.000
Granted they should have probably not gone monochrome red and they probably

34:43.000 --> 34:43.520
should have

34:43.520 --> 34:47.560
made it less cumbersome, but you know, I think it's a good idea.

34:47.560 --> 34:51.560
It did have the best commercials. The one thing, and some other stuff that they

34:51.560 --> 34:53.080
mentioned too, they were saying

34:53.080 --> 34:56.760
you know, that the games nowadays are starting to become

34:56.760 --> 35:00.400
you know, just beefed up versions of existing games, and of course with that

35:00.400 --> 35:03.880
the budgets are getting bigger, but you don't always need to have big budgets to

35:03.880 --> 35:04.440
create

35:04.440 --> 35:07.920
you know, successful games. And for example, look at Brain Training,

35:07.920 --> 35:11.520
which is selling like crazy over there, and

35:11.520 --> 35:14.640
I don't know. It probably didn't cost that much to make.

35:14.640 --> 35:18.000
It's definitely not, you know, perfect example.

35:18.000 --> 35:22.000
I just read an article for the Godfather game.

35:22.000 --> 35:25.480
I just saw the same thing. I just saw this. Like not even an hour before the

35:25.480 --> 35:27.080
show tonight. The Godfather game.

35:27.080 --> 35:30.680
Eight hundred million dollars to produce this game

35:30.680 --> 35:34.560
and they're gonna be trying to make this money back.

35:34.560 --> 35:38.160
And to be honest, it's another fucking goddamn

35:38.160 --> 35:42.740
Grand Theft Auto clone except oh now it has Marlon Brando in it

35:42.740 --> 35:47.320
oh okay that doesn't make it any better well now to be fair that article is more

35:47.320 --> 35:49.800
say they didn't spend a hundred ten million on the game they

35:49.800 --> 35:53.240
the name yeah well not just that but the fact that they didn't release it at

35:53.240 --> 35:54.080
Christmas time

35:54.080 --> 35:57.880
cost them about 800 million to that but I'm sitting here going well it still

35:57.880 --> 36:01.320
cost like multi-millions dollars make of course I'm not surprised you have a voice

36:01.320 --> 36:03.240
acting that you're basically making a movie

36:03.240 --> 36:07.200
on a console but I'm like yeah I totally see what you're saying there

36:07.200 --> 36:12.400
usually these movie to games that they spend a lot of that money on are crap, I can't think

36:12.400 --> 36:15.620
of a whole lot of good ones, I'm sure there's some, they're not coming to mind right now,

36:15.620 --> 36:25.620
but you know, you take a game like Tetris, written out of some guy's basement, amazing.

36:25.620 --> 36:33.760
Alright, so, moving on, I have another quick quote on Miyamoto, this is coming from an

36:33.760 --> 36:38.020
on the Nintendo Europe website for those you guys that were saying that Twilight

36:38.020 --> 36:40.760
Princess was being delayed because it was going to be compatible with

36:40.760 --> 36:42.280
revolution in some way

36:42.280 --> 36:47.800
guess what you were right you were right it didn't even Nintendo say earlier that

36:47.800 --> 36:50.240
is not the reason why they delayed Twilight Princess

36:50.240 --> 36:54.200
yeah and here's Miyamoto saying and one of the most important features is that

36:54.200 --> 36:58.700
because revolution can run GameCube software when you play Twilight Princess

36:58.700 --> 37:03.240
on revolution you can take advantage of the revolution controller which makes

37:03.240 --> 37:06.480
Nintendo our liar of the week

37:06.480 --> 37:08.840
congratulations Nintendo you are liars

37:08.840 --> 37:11.680
of the week good job now you're going to

37:11.680 --> 37:13.720
help that's right you know where liars

37:13.720 --> 37:17.000
go third place baby third place no just

37:17.000 --> 37:18.840
kidding I i'd like to see a little love

37:18.840 --> 37:21.200
for Nintendo and it's just land huh

37:21.200 --> 37:22.600
they go to Disneyland

37:22.600 --> 37:25.320
all right dark soccer you've been doing

37:25.320 --> 37:27.480
some reading this week right cuz yes I

37:27.480 --> 37:29.400
can read reading books is good once in a

37:29.400 --> 37:31.880
while I'm actually reading about two

37:31.880 --> 37:34.920
novels right now, but I've also been getting magazines.

37:34.920 --> 37:35.920
That's right.

37:35.920 --> 37:36.920
And what have you read in a magazine recently?

37:36.920 --> 37:42.280
Actually, there's a magazine called Script Magazine, which unfortunately, in my rush

37:42.280 --> 37:44.800
to leave the house today, I did not bring with me.

37:44.800 --> 37:51.620
However, I've read this in-depth, written sort of screenplay style, where it's basically

37:51.620 --> 37:58.040
just sort of a day in the life of the production process for Silent Hill, you know, talking

37:58.040 --> 38:05.080
with the producer in France going over some of the lame ideas he started to bring up like

38:05.080 --> 38:11.220
well, no, we want to protect the integrity of the franchise and it's a really neat article.

38:11.220 --> 38:13.680
So I take it no dog ending.

38:13.680 --> 38:14.680
That would be hilarious.

38:14.680 --> 38:19.400
I think after the credits, oh my God, like you stay after the credits and then there's

38:19.400 --> 38:20.400
a dog ending.

38:20.400 --> 38:21.400
That'd be great.

38:21.400 --> 38:24.640
Or UFO.

38:24.640 --> 38:26.400
I hope they did that for the fans.

38:26.400 --> 38:28.560
I'll be so happy.

38:28.560 --> 38:35.040
They were fully bringing up how awesome it was to work with Kiryamoga, that was pretty

38:35.040 --> 38:36.040
cool.

38:36.040 --> 38:39.920
But it's a very good article, in fact, I'll tell you what, as soon as I can find the power

38:39.920 --> 38:45.720
supply for my scanner, I'll make it available for our listeners, but I would suggest going

38:45.720 --> 38:46.720
out and buying the magazine.

38:46.720 --> 38:51.680
Yes, because, you know, illegal reproductions are wrong, kids.

38:51.680 --> 38:53.040
I can transcribe it.

38:53.040 --> 38:54.480
There you go.

38:54.480 --> 38:57.280
Alright, um, very interesting, is that Script Magazine?

38:57.280 --> 38:59.560
Script Magazine, the I is in parenthesis.

38:59.560 --> 39:03.500
Now you're probably not going to be able to walk into a grocery store and find that.

39:03.500 --> 39:06.100
Actually, you can walk into Barnes and Noble, Borders.

39:06.100 --> 39:10.740
Comprehensive Magazine Store. I was at Borders when I saw it. Actually, Tower would be

39:10.740 --> 39:13.980
very likely to carry it since they carry all sorts of

39:13.980 --> 39:16.380
interesting... I don't think they have that everywhere.

39:16.380 --> 39:18.940
Probably Barnes and Noble and Borders and that stuff they do, though.

39:18.940 --> 39:23.320
And if all else fails, a lot of book sites will sell magazines online, Amazon

39:23.320 --> 39:27.560
does I think. Or since it's a movie magazine they might have it in some like

39:27.560 --> 39:34.800
movies. It's a magazine for script writers is what it is. That's cool. Alrighty, let's move on let's go to

39:34.800 --> 39:39.200
another story. Loki, regarding the PlayStation 3, there was some now there

39:39.200 --> 39:42.360
was some back and forth this week right after the conference people were saying

39:42.360 --> 39:46.120
oh that hard drives not gonna really come with a system or that's gonna make

39:46.120 --> 39:51.360
it make it the $900 system. Loki tell us once and for all what's the deal with a

39:51.360 --> 39:56.040
hard drive. It is standard. I mean, it's... of course you're gonna... you need the hard

39:56.040 --> 39:59.840
drive to play the games. They've come out and said that it's not gonna be like the Xbox

39:59.840 --> 40:04.320
360 where, okay, if you don't have a hard drive, memory card, that'll just be fine.

40:04.320 --> 40:09.960
No, you need the hard drive to play the games. So, of course, it's gonna be standard with

40:09.960 --> 40:17.040
the system and it was confirmed by Yahoo Games and, wow, Yahoo Games is actually legitimate.

40:17.040 --> 40:21.860
That's surprising. I think that's a bigger shocker than the knock on them.

40:21.860 --> 40:25.380
Yahoo featured our podcast once. Don't hurt our relations there.

40:25.380 --> 40:28.620
Oh, I'm sorry.

40:28.620 --> 40:32.900
In that case, Yahoo's so smart.

40:32.900 --> 40:37.040
Alright, speaking of hard drives, you may remember last week

40:37.040 --> 40:40.020
I called a certain gaming company a bunch of

40:40.020 --> 40:43.460
bastards for this news article. I do want to say one thing real quick.

40:43.460 --> 40:47.100
I think it's a great idea that they are including the hard drive, because now developers can

40:47.100 --> 40:52.220
develop with the hard drive in mind, unlike the 360.

40:52.220 --> 40:57.420
And speaking of the 360, I kind of called Microsoft a bunch of bastards this last week

40:57.420 --> 41:01.260
over this news article, and it turned out to be false.

41:01.260 --> 41:06.780
The 100 gigabyte hard drive rumor that was going around a couple weeks ago, or actually

41:06.780 --> 41:12.640
last week, starting from the Best Buy employee or something, they actually got word officially

41:12.640 --> 41:19.280
from Microsoft, from the global marketing team, saying, we haven't announced any additional

41:19.280 --> 41:24.480
hard drives for the Xbox 360 beyond the 20GB version available today.

41:24.480 --> 41:31.040
So I'd like to offer an apology to Microsoft for calling you guys bastards.

41:31.040 --> 41:34.600
And Halo Rocks, please forgive me.

41:34.600 --> 41:37.920
They're still bastards.

41:37.920 --> 41:38.920
But not for that.

41:38.920 --> 41:40.240
For other things.

41:40.240 --> 41:42.480
Many, many other things.

41:42.480 --> 41:45.820
We can find a reason why all these gaming companies are bastards, though, this way.

41:45.820 --> 41:48.520
Nintendo lied, you know, forget it.

41:48.520 --> 41:50.400
Nintendo lied to us.

41:50.400 --> 41:53.320
I feel steep in my soul.

41:53.320 --> 41:58.080
Well, you know, Chat Room's saying that we're being too hard on Nintendo, because maybe

41:58.080 --> 41:59.080
that wasn't...

41:59.080 --> 42:00.080
Where did that come from?

42:00.080 --> 42:04.400
Nintendo Maniac 64, of course, defending Nintendo, saying, that doesn't mean that's why it was

42:04.400 --> 42:05.400
delayed.

42:05.400 --> 42:10.840
I mean, that Zelda thing isn't necessarily the only reason why it was delayed, but come

42:10.840 --> 42:11.840
on.

42:11.840 --> 42:16.220
incentive right I think I think back to the Zelda games that were on Game Boy

42:16.220 --> 42:19.460
Color and the Game Boy Advance why didn't they come out to the end of Game

42:19.460 --> 42:22.880
Boy Color for that exact same reason to transition people on to Game Boy Advance

42:22.880 --> 42:26.820
with one of their biggest franchises I'm not surprised at all I have a question

42:26.820 --> 42:32.360
for Nintendo why didn't they give us this to tell of you the best version of

42:32.360 --> 42:38.140
Zelda ever all right moving on oh this is this is horrible is that what what's

42:38.140 --> 42:43.420
today March March 19th is today's date and we're already having to dispel April

42:43.420 --> 42:50.380
Fool's jokes I hate April Fool's I hate it so much it's horrible but of course

42:50.380 --> 42:54.620
you know we might have to do something of our own we'll see or we would never

42:54.620 --> 42:59.180
do that to you guys but we wouldn't the bad thing is is that all these magazines

42:59.180 --> 43:04.820
put their April issues out in mid-march so now there's all these lies coming to

43:04.820 --> 43:06.820
to you from these gaming magazines saying,

43:06.820 --> 43:08.180
oh, it's an April Fool's joke.

43:08.180 --> 43:09.620
God, that sucks, we're on the second.

43:09.620 --> 43:11.300
We were broadcasting on the second.

43:11.300 --> 43:14.700
If only one more day we could have fun at that show.

43:14.700 --> 43:15.540
No, we'll see.

43:15.540 --> 43:18.780
It's like, today we're doing it without a script, woo-hoo!

43:18.780 --> 43:20.180
All right, so now we would like to tell you

43:20.180 --> 43:22.900
about some of the real lies being spread this week

43:22.900 --> 43:26.400
by gaming magazines under the guise of April Fool's jokes.

43:26.400 --> 43:27.820
Loki, what's the first one?

43:27.820 --> 43:31.180
The first one is, I'm not necessarily gonna call this

43:31.180 --> 43:33.580
an April Fool's joke because I'm not really

43:33.580 --> 43:39.680
certain if it is. Basically it's some Duke Nukem Forever gameplay footage. It was featured

43:39.680 --> 43:45.160
and leaked to the internet I guess. And it looks like an in development version of it.

43:45.160 --> 43:50.000
I watched the actual video and it looked pretty convincing to me. I mean it looked like a

43:50.000 --> 43:57.800
game in progress. It had the Duke Nukem voice acting in it and it looked like it actually

43:57.800 --> 44:02.720
could have been the game. I don't think it's, you know, it might be a mod or something but

44:02.720 --> 44:09.080
I don't think it's a real game, but still not real, but Duke Nukem still probably coming out later. All right

44:09.680 --> 44:12.760
Dark Sakura, what's another big lie under the guise of April Fools?

44:13.400 --> 44:15.400
Halo 3

44:15.640 --> 44:18.040
Well, no, we're getting we're gonna get a Halo 3

44:18.040 --> 44:24.680
I mean that's inevitable, but there was a rumor that Halo 3 was being called forerunner and it's actually just a April Fools joke

44:24.920 --> 44:29.400
There was a post on the Xbox forums with someone calling himself DM duo Maxwell

44:29.400 --> 44:34.680
anyone who watches Gundam Wing know who that was who said he transcribed an

44:34.680 --> 44:41.080
article about the game from an upcoming issue of Game Informer magazine which is

44:41.080 --> 44:47.240
Game Stops big magazine basically said that the game was gonna have huge

44:47.240 --> 44:51.840
persistent worlds built around a modified Halo 2 engine that was gonna

44:51.840 --> 44:55.920
feature Master Chief and would have a co-op mode for up to four players but

44:55.920 --> 45:04.400
But according to Bungie, it's a big pile of poo, to quote, he said, we can't smack him

45:04.400 --> 45:07.560
for an April Fool's gag, not like we never did any.

45:07.560 --> 45:12.160
Well, and I've got another, so that was lie number two.

45:12.160 --> 45:16.620
Here's another lie, and funny enough, this one involves Halo as well, and it's the April

45:16.620 --> 45:18.960
issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly.

45:18.960 --> 45:24.540
They are running a lie right now that says, Halo Combat Evolved will appear on the Xbox

45:24.540 --> 45:31.860
live marketplace but not actually gonna happen here at least there's at least

45:31.860 --> 45:34.980
they're saying here that this is not likely to happen it's probably their

45:34.980 --> 45:41.500
April Fool's joke but you logically think whom could Microsoft eventually

45:41.500 --> 45:45.040
jump on this bandwagon because you know you got Sony is saying they're gonna do

45:45.040 --> 45:48.360
the same thing with the PlayStation games maybe this isn't such an

45:48.360 --> 45:52.340
unrealistic I think you're gonna need a bigger hard drive that's the case hmm

45:52.340 --> 45:57.740
interesting well we shall see alright so moving on

45:57.740 --> 46:02.900
let's go let's go from lies to apologies this has been this has been a show full

46:02.900 --> 46:03.980
of apologies and lies

46:03.980 --> 46:08.740
low-key who's who's saying sorry now Star Force and I wouldn't really say

46:08.740 --> 46:09.740
that this is

46:09.740 --> 46:14.420
I I don't know there's sort of an apology here Star Force if you guys

46:14.420 --> 46:16.780
remember back last week they're the ones that reporting

46:16.780 --> 46:19.900
they're the company that's you know does security

46:19.900 --> 46:26.100
you know, copy protection software and this, you know, basically they were leaking a torrent

46:26.100 --> 46:33.800
of Galactic Civilization 2 on their website just because, you know, Stardock didn't want

46:33.800 --> 46:37.480
to use Star Force's copy protection schemes.

46:37.480 --> 46:47.940
So they said, yeah, we're sorry, but it's just like, you know, basically, this is, I

46:47.940 --> 46:53.500
I was listening to some other podcasts this week that were talking about this company.

46:53.500 --> 46:54.900
They're really evil.

46:54.900 --> 46:59.940
I mean, I never really, because I don't play a lot of PC games, I mean, granted, between

46:59.940 --> 47:03.780
Final Fantasy XI and World of Warcraft, that's enough PC games for me, because that's most

47:03.780 --> 47:08.880
of my PC game time, but I never really realized, like, they practically install spyware on

47:08.880 --> 47:10.380
your computer, it sounds like.

47:10.380 --> 47:11.380
It's kind of fascinating.

47:11.380 --> 47:13.460
I'm surprised they get away with it.

47:13.460 --> 47:20.740
So basically they apologized for the incident and said they took down the link, but it's

47:20.740 --> 47:21.740
just like...

47:21.740 --> 47:22.740
Yeah, I know.

47:22.740 --> 47:23.740
Too little too late.

47:23.740 --> 47:24.740
It's still pretty rotten to be doing that.

47:24.740 --> 47:26.620
Too little too late.

47:26.620 --> 47:29.500
You know, here's the thing guys, if you don't, and I see a lot of people in our chat room

47:29.500 --> 47:32.140
right now are going, yeah, F them, they suck, duh duh duh.

47:32.140 --> 47:34.480
Here it is guys, vote with your dollars.

47:34.480 --> 47:38.500
If you don't like this company, don't buy anything that their product is involved with.

47:38.500 --> 47:39.780
End of story.

47:39.780 --> 47:42.560
And then soon you will no longer see them because they'll go out of business because

47:42.560 --> 47:43.960
nobody's buying their stuff

47:43.960 --> 47:46.480
vote with your dollars you don't like it

47:46.480 --> 47:49.900
or let the publishers that are using this kind of cop protection scheme know

47:49.900 --> 47:53.880
that you're not gonna buy their game because of this

47:53.880 --> 47:55.580
uh... moving on

47:55.580 --> 47:57.180
dark sakura

47:57.180 --> 47:58.720
we talked about sega earlier

47:58.720 --> 48:00.060
yes cuz i love sega

48:00.060 --> 48:02.200
well here's something that's kinda might be

48:02.200 --> 48:04.200
sad with sega but it's a rumor right?

48:04.200 --> 48:08.760
well yeah there's been indicators that Yuji Naka is quitting sega

48:08.760 --> 48:12.000
he's basically the head of a sonic team

48:12.000 --> 48:15.360
Wow. I love Sonic Team!

48:15.360 --> 48:18.640
My god, do we know anything about why he's doing this or anything?

48:18.640 --> 48:22.880
There's a speculation that he's going to be creating his own

48:22.880 --> 48:26.360
company that may be aligned with Sega but that's

48:26.360 --> 48:31.040
again speculation. This is the man that brought us Sonic the Hedgehog

48:31.040 --> 48:34.160
and Phantasy Star Online, Knights.

48:34.160 --> 48:37.860
So pretty much like all the great Sega games you start to think about, this guy

48:37.860 --> 48:41.880
made them. Yuji Naka is the man. That would be like Miyamoto

48:41.880 --> 48:47.940
leaving Nintendo, in a way. Me and Meadow left Nintendo and Nintendo would crumble.

48:47.940 --> 48:55.260
But Sega's already, I'm sorry, Sammy Sega. I have to say Sammy Sega. Then again Sammy

48:55.260 --> 49:02.940
did bring us Guilty Gear, so. But you know, still, Sega, having something like this even

49:02.940 --> 49:09.380
be rumored just sort of makes me think how the mighty have fallen. I know, I'll be...

49:09.380 --> 49:12.540
They're not going to have a Sega in 20 years if they keep this up.

49:12.540 --> 49:15.700
You know what's interesting though, because we have so many stories tonight about companies

49:15.700 --> 49:18.740
buying each other out, and I think they're not coming up until part B, but we have so

49:18.740 --> 49:22.180
many stories about companies buying each other, it's kind of interesting to hear that one

49:22.180 --> 49:26.180
might be, because essentially you take some of the biggest brains at Sega and split it

49:26.180 --> 49:30.680
off, that's almost like now a company's split, so that's kind of, you know, a little interesting

49:30.680 --> 49:31.680
to me.

49:31.680 --> 49:35.260
I guess it's just business, just another day in the gaming business, boys and girls.

49:35.260 --> 49:38.940
I'll have to go home and hook up the Saturn in the morning.

49:38.940 --> 49:39.940
Well, we'll see.

49:39.940 --> 49:40.940
It hasn't happened yet.

49:40.940 --> 49:41.940
It hasn't happened yet, but we'll see.

49:41.940 --> 49:44.780
I just mean for the greatness that Sega was.

49:44.780 --> 49:45.780
Alright.

49:45.780 --> 49:50.220
Um, Loki, here's something else to mourn about.

49:50.220 --> 49:52.980
Dark Sakura, put this on your list of things to talk about when you're mourning.

49:52.980 --> 49:55.260
What do we have to mourn over as well?

49:55.260 --> 50:00.020
Well, you know, it was a good run or a roll, I should say.

50:00.020 --> 50:06.860
The Katamari team has broken up, and so we're not going to be seeing any more Katamari games.

50:06.860 --> 50:08.320
How do you know this?

50:08.320 --> 50:15.260
Because the website says so, katamaridomasi.jp.

50:15.260 --> 50:19.500
There was a three-day countdown, and people were anticipating, oh hey, there was a countdown

50:19.500 --> 50:23.260
last time it was the announcement of me and my Katamari.

50:23.260 --> 50:24.260
Now it's...

50:24.260 --> 50:25.260
No.

50:25.260 --> 50:27.660
We're done.

50:27.660 --> 50:30.380
Maybe it's a really bad April Fool's joke?

50:30.380 --> 50:35.300
Well, the creator of Katamari Damacy himself has said he doesn't like video games.

50:35.300 --> 50:38.820
Wasn't he going to go make a kid's playground or something?

50:38.820 --> 50:40.820
Playground equipment, yep.

50:40.820 --> 50:42.260
That's weird.

50:42.260 --> 50:46.580
But where there's money to be made and Katamari is still a successful franchise, don't you

50:46.580 --> 50:53.580
think Namco might try and say, oh well, if they all left, we'll do something ourselves?

50:53.580 --> 50:55.660
Is that possible?

50:55.660 --> 51:00.060
Or do you think they'll respect the wishes to not continue that franchise?

51:00.060 --> 51:04.660
I think the problem with that being is that even if they decide to try to keep going with

51:04.660 --> 51:08.660
it, it's not going to have the same feeling that the games now do.

51:08.660 --> 51:14.420
When you, it's sort of like, when you have a recipe and you have it at the same restaurant

51:14.420 --> 51:18.300
and then another restaurant tries to copy it, it just doesn't taste the same way.

51:18.300 --> 51:20.900
It's the same thing.

51:20.900 --> 51:22.180
Interesting.

51:22.180 --> 51:27.640
You know and at the same time you can kind of maybe respect this decision honestly because

51:27.640 --> 51:33.140
part of the problem with games today as it is that Katamari Damacy kind of really went

51:33.140 --> 51:37.040
against the grain with this when it first came out is that too damn many sequels, too

51:37.040 --> 51:42.520
many copies of other games, too many of the same thing and Katamari Damacy was well respected

51:42.520 --> 51:47.400
for breaking that mold so I think maybe this is why they've decided to quit now before

51:47.400 --> 51:52.200
they become the thing that they were representative against.

51:52.200 --> 51:55.440
So at that time, you kind of have to respect them.

51:55.440 --> 52:00.600
I just hope that at least these guys will put out more games of some type, and even

52:00.600 --> 52:04.940
if it's not another Katamari Damacy game, you've got to admit that sense of humor that's

52:04.940 --> 52:10.020
in Katamari Damacy, that level that the music is at and all that stuff, that could lend

52:10.020 --> 52:12.580
itself great to another very original concept.

52:12.580 --> 52:17.940
So I hope we see many of the brains behind Team Katamari, even if they broke up, many

52:17.940 --> 52:24.020
of the same big minds behind it create something new that can be the Katamari Damacy of next

52:24.020 --> 52:25.020
year.

52:25.020 --> 52:26.020
So we'll see.

52:26.020 --> 52:30.600
Or just, I don't know, just get part of the development team and start a new team.

52:30.600 --> 52:34.260
It doesn't take the same minds to create the game, they didn't really change much from

52:34.260 --> 52:38.420
both games anyways, I mean, I don't know.

52:38.420 --> 52:43.620
comments from our chat room, Arsef says, yeah, too many sequels would defeat the inventiveness

52:43.620 --> 52:44.740
of the series.

52:44.740 --> 52:48.700
Xander C says, I hope he makes more games, but hopefully it will be original stuff.

52:48.700 --> 52:50.860
No more Katamari, please.

52:50.860 --> 52:52.140
So there you have it.

52:52.140 --> 52:55.900
So maybe fans are just kind of accepting this, that yep, you know what, this is what you

52:55.900 --> 52:57.820
got to do to stay original.

52:57.820 --> 53:02.360
All right, well, you know, at the same time we can be original, we can also celebrate

53:02.360 --> 53:03.360
the classics.

53:03.360 --> 53:06.860
Now you guys know the walk of game down at the Metreon in San Francisco, and of course

53:06.860 --> 53:08.960
Of course now, the metronome was just sold recently.

53:08.960 --> 53:12.400
We don't know how this is going to affect the walk of game, but they just recently had

53:12.400 --> 53:17.280
their 2006 ceremony where they inducted John Carmack, who was the technical director at

53:17.280 --> 53:23.740
ID Software, Doomquake, Sid Meier, Civilization among many other things.

53:23.740 --> 53:25.160
That guy is honestly a god to me.

53:25.160 --> 53:28.500
Sid Meier has made some of the greatest PC games of all time.

53:28.500 --> 53:30.680
They were lifetime achievement guys.

53:30.680 --> 53:35.280
Also some games that were celebrated for their characters as well as being a game, EverQuest,

53:35.280 --> 53:40.880
Final Fantasy, Lara Croft, and Starcraft all being inducted into the Walk of Game, which

53:40.880 --> 53:44.420
I have yet to really see, so I might have to take a trip to the Metreon before it gets,

53:44.420 --> 53:48.120
you know, turned into the Mega Mall that Westfield might turn it into.

53:48.120 --> 53:51.920
I kind of am hoping that maybe Westfield won't screw it up and they'll try to still keep

53:51.920 --> 53:56.800
it like a gaming center, like make it appeal to gamers, that would make me a happy, happy

53:56.800 --> 53:57.800
kid.

53:57.800 --> 54:00.480
They'll put an EB in there as well, or GameStop.

54:00.480 --> 54:03.340
But they have the official Sony store, so that would be kind of competing, so I don't

54:03.340 --> 54:04.340
know if they could do that.

54:04.340 --> 54:08.440
But I'd like to see them try, you know, maybe like a, because they have, what do they have

54:08.440 --> 54:09.440
in there?

54:09.440 --> 54:13.460
They have the comic store and they have that in there, so maybe like a gaming store for

54:13.460 --> 54:19.300
like gaming culture where they sell like the magazines and, you know, shirts and stuff.

54:19.300 --> 54:23.320
And since this won't be Sony specific, why not lure Nintendo and Microsoft to try and

54:23.320 --> 54:25.140
do some stores in here as well, you know?

54:25.140 --> 54:27.480
Still need the Sega Land theme park.

54:27.480 --> 54:28.840
Why not Sega come open a store?

54:28.840 --> 54:32.240
Some of the third-party developers kind of sell off some of their big things.

54:32.240 --> 54:36.440
Gamco could have a store, you know, all this, a Konami store, would be kind of cool.

54:36.440 --> 54:40.940
I bet in five years it's going to turn into a Pokemon Center.

54:40.940 --> 54:43.680
Why not open up a Pokemon Center in it somewhere, you know?

54:43.680 --> 54:45.640
Because Pokemon Centers are evil!

54:45.640 --> 54:49.080
But some, you know what, some people like it, so why not have it for them as well, you

54:49.080 --> 54:50.320
know, something for everybody.

54:50.320 --> 54:52.460
I think that would be cool to keep it like a gaming themed place.

54:52.460 --> 54:58.120
Some people worship the devil too, but that doesn't make it right.

54:58.120 --> 54:59.120
Oh snap.

54:59.120 --> 55:01.240
People are entitled to their own religion.

55:01.240 --> 55:05.560
Speaking of people worshipping the devil, a certain game franchise has turned 25 this

55:05.560 --> 55:08.760
week and we're not sure how this franchise keeps going.

55:08.760 --> 55:12.600
So maybe it is Divine Darkness Intervention or something.

55:12.600 --> 55:15.260
Frogger has turned 25.

55:15.260 --> 55:20.480
Don't get me wrong, Frogger is a wonderful game 25 years ago, but these recent releases...

55:20.480 --> 55:21.480
Wait this way.

55:21.480 --> 55:22.480
Not so great.

55:22.480 --> 55:24.240
The original Frogger was a really good game.

55:24.240 --> 55:27.260
Every other Frogger game or game that has Frogger in the title...

55:27.260 --> 55:32.300
Wait, wait, wait, actually I had a game on Commodore 64 called Frogger 2

55:32.300 --> 55:36.060
3 Deep that was kind of neat and that's it.

55:36.060 --> 55:39.940
Then after that I'll back up what you're saying.

55:39.940 --> 55:45.060
Frogger, um, yeah pretty much Frogger nowadays

55:45.060 --> 55:49.020
is just, you see Frogger on a game or Frogger like helmet chaos

55:49.020 --> 55:53.660
you're like, wow, crap. That's what that is, it's crap.

55:53.660 --> 55:59.180
Nope. I mean, not much you can really do with Frogger. It's such a simple game.

55:59.180 --> 56:01.780
Well, they still have another game coming out. Well, now it's more...

56:01.780 --> 56:05.540
I played the Frogger that they came out with on PlayStation. I think that was

56:05.540 --> 56:07.700
about the last time I played a Frogger game because

56:07.700 --> 56:10.880
I just wasn't into it. It wasn't that great, you know?

56:10.880 --> 56:14.060
Yeah, now they're trying to get like a storyline. No.

56:14.060 --> 56:17.940
No, no, no. It's just a goddamn game.

56:17.940 --> 56:22.820
I think Frogger, like, would be a good game on Xbox Live

56:22.820 --> 56:27.420
arcade but do it like super ultra realistic like have it look like a real

56:27.420 --> 56:28.040
frog

56:28.040 --> 56:31.160
have the traffic look real that would be cool

56:31.160 --> 56:34.960
multiplayer might be kinda fun like a race to the end I want to be the driver

56:34.960 --> 56:38.800
you should be able to push there you go think about the innovation there with

56:38.800 --> 56:42.160
Pac-Man and like you know on that Pac-Man vs. some people could be the

56:42.160 --> 56:42.760
ghosts

56:42.760 --> 56:46.040
why not have some people be the drivers on Frogger

56:46.040 --> 56:51.520
or have your frog with the ability to push other frogs in front of the car

56:51.520 --> 56:53.520
That would be excellent.

56:53.520 --> 56:55.520
Someone needs to play the crocodile.

56:55.520 --> 57:01.520
You know what? Konami, you guys need to hire us to develop, to breathe some new life into your Frogger franchise.

57:01.520 --> 57:03.520
Seriously?

57:03.520 --> 57:11.520
Well, you know what? Maybe there's another way to breathe life into the Frogger franchise and some people are trying to imitate this in real life. What's this about?

57:11.520 --> 57:19.520
What do you get when you combine lots of alcohol, a Roomba, and something that looks like a frog?

57:19.520 --> 57:26.520
Well, you get real life Frogger. Basically, they have taken this Bluetooth-enabled Roomba,

57:26.720 --> 57:33.720
a green t-shirt, and lots of alcohol, and they made it cross traffic. They made it cross

57:35.800 --> 57:42.800
a four-lane highway about ten times before it got run over by a Toyota 4Runner. And to

57:42.880 --> 57:47.200
be honest, this is way more entertaining than any of those Frogger games that have come

57:47.200 --> 57:52.560
out recently. I would do this. This would be something I would totally do. And this

57:52.560 --> 57:56.580
is excellent. There was actually something sort of similar

57:56.580 --> 58:03.580
that they did in New York City where they did, using a GPS satellite, did Pac-Man.

58:06.120 --> 58:11.560
Had a person dressed up with a big Pac-Man outfit and people dressed up as ghosts.

58:11.560 --> 58:15.080
You know in a future episode we need to do another list list and games I would like to

58:15.080 --> 58:18.700
see imitated in real life. We need to think about that one. Maybe next week if we have

58:18.700 --> 58:19.660
time. We'll see.

58:19.660 --> 58:20.620
We'll have to.

58:20.620 --> 58:23.720
That's a brilliant idea. My hat's off to those kids who put that together.

58:23.720 --> 58:24.720
We're ready for booze.

58:24.720 --> 58:31.680
I guess. Yeah, wow. All right. Moving on to another story, we're going to go over to Dark

58:31.680 --> 58:37.320
Sakura, who's got some news from the UK. What's going on with our buddies overseas this week?

58:37.320 --> 58:38.320
Dark Sakura?

58:38.320 --> 58:41.240
Well, it's from all over, but mostly UK stuff.

58:41.240 --> 58:42.240
Okay.

58:42.240 --> 58:47.880
Tecmo has a new automatic update for the Xbox 360 for Dead or Alive 4.

58:47.880 --> 58:55.280
It's meant to adjust some of the interface and balance the characters, tweaking the launcher

58:55.280 --> 58:59.800
moves, stun moves, sweeps, a few of the character speeds are changed, some sped up, some slowed

58:59.800 --> 59:02.080
down.

59:02.080 --> 59:12.000
Some of the power moves do less damage, encouraging players to be more skillful.

59:12.000 --> 59:17.320
When you download the update, you will also have the option to reset your battle tactics,

59:17.320 --> 59:21.520
but your zac money, avatars, all that will still be the same.

59:21.520 --> 59:23.880
The DOA4 update is available on Xbox Live.

59:23.880 --> 59:28.280
I wonder if it will make the last boss less of a cheap bitch.

59:28.280 --> 59:30.200
Cause she is!

59:30.200 --> 59:31.320
I know.

59:31.320 --> 59:36.440
I honestly haven't really super duper played a whole lot of Dead or Alive 4, and I've been

59:36.440 --> 59:39.880
too afraid to play online cause I'll sit and watch some of those battles and I'll go like,

59:39.880 --> 59:42.460
you know, I'm gonna get my ass kicked.

59:42.460 --> 59:44.780
I need to play with people on my own level.

59:44.780 --> 59:46.000
Where are the, like,

59:46.000 --> 59:49.840
handicap players on Xbox Live? Why aren't you ever on? Those people who,

59:49.840 --> 59:53.400
you know, who need a handicap on their game because they're not very good.

59:53.400 --> 59:56.680
That's what I need. I can admit it. I'm not great at every game.

59:56.680 --> 01:00:00.320
I was talking to somebody recently online who assumed that, you know, because

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:03.880
I did this show every week, that I'm good at every video game. That's so not the case.

01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:05.560
There's some games I'm good at,

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:08.000
I'll admit. You know, I'm pretty good at a lot of puzzle games.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.200
but you know not every game please no I mean if you

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:14.440
if you're gonna add me to Xbox Live if you dig through the Orange Lingerie forums

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:16.120
and decide to add me to Xbox Live

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:19.220
be prepared that I'm not gonna be much of a challenge in some of the games

01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:23.000
in other games it's on I will kick your butt on some of those arcade games

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.120
we'll see

01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:27.560
Rob needs food badly

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:31.520
not Gauntlet, Gauntlet was more fun for me when I was a kid

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:34.400
I find it to be too repetitive now

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:37.600
but I think I think our webmaster VX JasonXV

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:40.360
I think he challenged me to Root Beer Tapper when that one comes out on live.

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:42.440
So you're on, bitch! You're on!

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:44.980
You have to let us know how that one goes.

01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:46.600
We'll see.

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:50.220
2K Games has announced that Civ City Rome,

01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:53.720
it's a building strategy based on civilization,

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:56.740
is currently in development for PC.

01:00:56.740 --> 01:01:00.820
It's being produced by Firefly Studios. They brought a Stronghold

01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:03.580
and with Firaxis Games.

01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:06.940
and according to two k games it's going to have uh...

01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:11.820
the most detailed look at roman life ever depicted on a computer screen

01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:12.640
that's a quote

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:13.700
that is

01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:17.580
until the sieves come out and then you know then you'll have your nice roman

01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:20.560
family that you've got a you know

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:22.660
yeah i got no visit to the

01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:26.460
you know annual orgy and

01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:30.680
we don't greek or roman here i don't know that roman i know i know

01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:33.800
but it was also Greek.

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:36.840
Anyway, moving on from orgies,

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:41.120
you'll start off with a small settlement built until you have an imperial city,

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:44.200
you can have amphitheaters, legionnaire forts, weapon

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:48.480
workshops, circuses, gladiator school,

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:51.600
a whole bunch of stuff, and then you can set it on fire.

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:55.360
Really, you get to burn your city in a day?

01:01:55.360 --> 01:02:00.240
You could. Cool. So this is like most civilization games, you know,

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:04.360
Start small, get big, take over world, repeat.

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:08.980
There are screenshots available, which I will be posting in our chat room, but these can

01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:14.040
be seen from, if you go to Eurogamer.net, the links are there.

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:21.840
And actually, I've looked this through, it's very pretty, very, very pretty.

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:27.760
Lots of, you can have ports, one of those captures is of a port city.

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:30.360
You've got orchards.

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:34.560
You have a huge, massive city with a coliseum.

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:36.920
Oh, that does look pretty neat.

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:37.920
You know...

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:40.420
I'm going to link this in our chat.

01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:44.320
Sometimes PC gaming doesn't necessarily get the respect it deserves, and I know there's

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:48.800
a lot of hardcore PC gamers out there, and I can understand why, because it's a certain

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:53.880
niche of games that really seem to do very well on the PC, but despite all these next-gen

01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:57.780
consoles coming out, PC games really tend to stay on top of all that stuff.

01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:02.360
Of course, when you consider that the next-gen consoles are just souped-up PCs and that you

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:07.380
usually have to upgrade your PCs to play the latest games, it all kind of makes sense.

01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:08.700
It's still kind of neat, I guess.

01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:15.760
Well, what my hope is for games like this is that we see an actual degree of historical

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:21.340
accuracy in it, you know, because I think that, okay, I'm sure that a lot of the people

01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:26.860
People who know me off the show know I have a very big interest in anthropology and ancient

01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:28.100
history.

01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:33.980
I think something like this not only would be good for the whole strategy, building side

01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:38.540
of things, but also a chance to offer a little bit of a history lesson.

01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:41.460
Civilization was pretty good with that because the world leaders that you would come across

01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:45.340
would be kind of like how they were at their time.

01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:49.820
The folks that took over the world via war were very war-centric in the game, and the

01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:54.360
people who were leaders in politics were very, you know, politics center. So, you know, they've

01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:58.320
got a track record over there of being... you can learn at least a little something

01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:00.120
from your games, and that's always good.

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:03.280
I think that they should be educational at the same time.

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:04.280
All right.

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:09.480
But, you know, though, on the same topic, there's Civ IV's getting an expansion.

01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:14.800
Oh, very cool. You know, I still haven't played Civ IV. I feel really bad. It's just, you

01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:17.840
know, it's one of those things where it's like, I just don't have the time to play everything

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:22.080
I want to play I really want to try this out sometime. Well, the expansion is called

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:24.720
civilization for warlords

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:29.640
With new units that are called warlords. Mm-hmm. It'll have some of the greatest

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:33.960
military leader leaders and new scenarios you can change history

01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:39.120
You can take control of ancient Chinese Kingdom fight in the Peloponnesian Wars

01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:41.900
You can join Alexander the Great

01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:46.480
Become ruler of the Vikings pillage Europe. Hmm. That's kind of cool

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:48.480
You can you can be Genghis Khan

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:52.200
That's kind of cool. Yeah, you know and um

01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:00.920
Honestly, maybe I should just wait until all the expansions for Civ 4 are out because then there'll be that gold box set because there's

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:06.440
Always a gold box set at the end of every civilizations lifespan. That's like 20 bucks that has everything in it

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:08.760
So maybe I'm okay waiting. We'll see

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:11.720
Alexander the Great in this game looks kind of

01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:14.720
historically accurate.

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:16.720
Let's just leave it at that.

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:18.720
For those of us who have studied a little bit of history.

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:20.720
Alright, anything else?

01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:24.720
Well, I'm also posting that clip in the chatroom.

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:26.720

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:08.600
I actually found my copy of final fight guy the other day

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:12.000
Oh, that's cool. That was my favorite.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.200
I know, I never had it. Oh, anyway, sorry. Okay, sorry.

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:18.400
Um, Ice Age 2, the Meltdown video game.

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:22.360
Uh, Key of Heaven, Law and Order criminal intent on PC.

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:25.720
Dun dun! Mega Man powered up.

Uh, the 50th anniversary Namco...

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:32.200
50th anniversary? Okay. Namco Museum.

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:37.640
We have Pac-Man World 3, Samurai Warriors State of War, SpongeBob SquarePants

01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:42.760
the yellow avenger yay street racing syndicate elder scrolls for oblivion

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:45.480
the godfather worms open warfare

01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:49.760
alright so that's what's on the UK's plate

01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:53.880
and of course we'd like to take it back to the US with what's on the US's plate

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:55.240
Loki what are we getting this week

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:59.320
we're looking at elder scrolls for oblivion of course

01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:03.080
finally coming out for the 360

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:06.920
that's this week? I completely forgot that was this week oh my gosh

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:12.760
Yes, me and my Katamari, of course, got like a, you know, that's going to be awesome.

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:16.760
Milgir Acid 2, really good.

01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:17.760
What else was really good?

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:21.040
Tao's Curse of the Demon, remember that one from...

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:26.360
Yeah, I don't know, only if you're a hardcore role-playing game person, otherwise skippable.

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:29.680
The Godfather, it's really sweet.

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:36.280
Worms Open Warfare on NDS and PSP, which is going to be really sweet.

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:42.880
And then, of course, Blazing Angels on Xbox and Xbox 360, which is also really cool.

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:47.940
And Capcom Classics Collection remixed on the PSP, which includes Captain Commando and

01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:49.600
Street Fighter and Strider.

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:50.600
Funny...

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:51.600
Strider!

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:54.800
Aren't Tetris DS and Metroid Prime Hunters this week too?

01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:55.800
I was getting there.

01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:56.800
Oh, sorry.

01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:58.240
You had that finished look on your face.

01:07:58.240 --> 01:07:59.240
No, no, no.

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:00.240
No.

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:03.160
Of course, Metroid Prime Hunters and Tetris DS played that this week.

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:07.420
And as I mentioned, I think I said The Godfather, of course.

01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:09.960
There was a Tetris DS commercial on TV this week.

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:12.400
Some of the gaming sites picked it up, but I actually saw it for the first time, like,

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:14.160
I was watching some show and they aired it.

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:15.160
It's kind of funny.

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:16.160
How did I forget?

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:19.160
Karaoke Revolution Country is coming out this week.

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:22.040
Oh, hooray!

01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:23.800
And of course next week, BeatMania.

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:25.900
You know what, this is a huge week for games.

01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:26.900
It really is.

01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:31.120
I mean, at least the kind of games that we play, it sounds like, you know, I'm like,

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:33.260
Oh my God, my wallet's gonna hurt this week.

01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:35.120
I mean, right there, you name like four games

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:35.960
I wanna pick up.

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:39.440
Me and My Katamari, Tetris DS, Prime Hunters, and Oblivion.

01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:40.600
I want all those games.

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:43.920
And honestly though, the price of the first three combined

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:45.520
will probably be the same as Oblivion,

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:46.920
so I'll probably just pick up the first three

01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:48.740
and wait a little bit to hear the reviews

01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:49.580
of Elder Scrolls a little more.

01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:50.420
How about this?

01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:52.400
How about you just see my copy of Oblivion

01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:53.240
when I buy it this week?

01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:54.440
Here we go, and then maybe you could borrow

01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:56.600
my copy of Me and My Katamari or something,

01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:58.560
which reminds me, I want that PSV back.

01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:02.800
You will get your PSP back. I have a funny story about your adapter.

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:06.400
Oh? Well, I loaned a Guanagirl my camera

01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:11.160
and I gave her your adapter with it. Because it looked like the one for my camera.

01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:15.320
I'll get it back. Guanagirl, if you're listening,

01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:18.480
I want that back. Or I'm sending out the hitman.

01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:23.160
I got my camera back. I'm teasing, it's all good. That's cool. I just don't have your adapter.

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:27.560
Whatever. I also, real quick, since we were just on the UK news, we

01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:30.760
We actually have one of our UK listeners tuned in tonight, Simmel.

01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:34.240
Now that's hardcore, to be listening live when you're living in a different time zone,

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:36.000
because I know we've had in the past...

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.400
It's 3 a.m. there.

01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:38.400
That's wow.

01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:41.880
And we've had folks from Australia listen live too, and I know that's more like afternoon

01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:45.520
time, but that's awesome that you guys are tuning in and listening live in those different

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:46.520
time zones.

01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:47.520
Hooray for our fellow night owls.

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:48.520
That's awesome.

01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:54.240
Man, I just wouldn't want to have to calculate the time zones, that's all.

01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:56.920
Too much brain worky.

01:09:56.920 --> 01:10:02.720
I moderate the UK site. I think our streaming site Live 365 will

01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:06.720
auto-calculate on the scheduler. Like if you go to look at our scheduler of live programs

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:10.080
it will auto-calculate the times for you, I think.

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:15.400
So check that out on our station page. Okay. For UK, add five hours. For France,

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:19.880
add one or two more hours. Anyways, as I was going to mention, I was

01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:24.720
going to mention real quickly next week, which is really cool, BeatMania, Kingdom Hearts

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:25.720
too.

01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:26.720
Oh, God.

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:27.720
See, this end...

01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:28.720
What is up with the end of...

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:31.240
Is the end of March usually this big of a gaming time?

01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:32.240
I don't remember this last year.

01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:34.640
It drops off next month, so let me put it that way.

01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:36.920
And of course, more stuff for me.

01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:39.920
Far Cry Instinct's Predator and Rumble Roses.

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:44.720
I think it's excellent that all this stuff is coming out right before my birthday.

01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:46.680
Yeah, convenient for you.

01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:47.680
Oh, yes.

01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:51.000
Well, at least convenient for those of us that might have a hard time thinking of a

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.960
gift for you otherwise, though, is it, you know...

01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:55.960
So the problem is, what if you end up with like, you know, 40 copies of Kingdom Hearts

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:56.960
2?

01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:57.960
GameStop gift certificates, baby.

01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:02.280
I'm going to buy you the Game Boy Advance version of Cats, which is coming out.

01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:06.200
Yes, and I'm going to buy that SpongeBob SquarePants yellow adventure game for you, because you

01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:07.200
should love that.

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:10.040
I could use it for Shermie's litter box, thank you.

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:11.040
Alright.

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:14.520
For those who don't know, Shermie is my cat.

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:15.520
That's right.

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:16.520
There we go.

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:17.880
Named after a video game character.

01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:18.880
Which one?

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:19.880
I don't...

01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:20.880
Shermie from King of Fighters!

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:21.880
Okay, quick story.

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:25.560
really play a lot of her name on the adoption paper with Sherman I said that

01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:29.520
that sucks for a female cat so he called her Shermy with the video game tie-in

01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:34.240
for she's the one who does the dancing moves on Kimurochi. I didn't play a lot of King of Fighters I played the

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:46.320
Final... Final... Fatal Fury! Why do I keep wanting to say Final? Final Fury! I have Fatal Fury 2 on EOGO. I remember Fatal Fury Special that was cool

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:51.520
cuz every special is hot return of duck King it's awesome art of fighting art of

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:54.360
fighting was pretty cool too that was the one that had like King in it and

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:59.600
stuff yeah with the zoom ins yeah no classic Street Fighter 2 rip off I show

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:06.040
down well because okay all right Ken and Ryu were ripped off for art of fighting

01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:12.440
with Rio and Robert Robert and then I remember Capcom to make fun of them came

01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:21.800
up with Dan Hibiki in Street Fighter who wears a gi like Rio and has Robert Garcia's hair.

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:23.280
I never made that connection.

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:24.280
It's awesome.

01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:25.280
It's true.

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:28.280
See, I used to play as Rob in Art of Fighting because, you know, he's got a good name.

01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:29.280
Yeah.

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:30.280
There you go.

01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:33.680
