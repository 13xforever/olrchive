[SPEAKER_09]: Pacific.

[SPEAKER_09]: But they're going to have a pre-show as well, so just tune in at 6 Pacific and you'll be good.

8
00:01:01,977 --> 00:01:06,100
[SPEAKER_09]: They're actually going to have performing at the show this Guitar Hero Band.

9
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:12,306
[SPEAKER_09]: And what they've done is they've actually gotten heroes of guitar playing to perform at this band, like

10
00:01:12,566 --> 00:01:13,966
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to read the entire list here.

11
00:01:13,986 --> 00:01:15,387
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys can go to allgames.com to check it out.

12
00:01:15,427 --> 00:01:15,867
[SPEAKER_09]: But get this.

13
00:01:16,267 --> 00:01:19,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Lyle Workman, who's like a guitar player for Sting and Beck.

14
00:01:19,668 --> 00:01:24,069
[SPEAKER_09]: And they have Daryl Anders, who's the bassist for Tower of Power and Bonnie Hayes.

15
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:29,870
[SPEAKER_09]: They also have Marcus Henderson, who's the guitar player for Drist and En Vogue.

16
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:34,972
[SPEAKER_09]: And they just have like all these standout stars there that are going to be performing in this band.

17
00:01:34,992 --> 00:01:35,832
[SPEAKER_09]: So that should be kind of fun.

18
00:01:36,212 --> 00:01:36,752
[SPEAKER_09]: So check that out.

19
00:01:36,772 --> 00:01:40,513
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to be airing that live over on All Games, our buddies over there.

20
00:01:41,454 --> 00:01:44,056
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so let's get into some news.

21
00:01:44,496 --> 00:01:48,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Last segment we talked about Katamari Damacy ending, sad.

22
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,563
[SPEAKER_09]: We also talked about some big lies going around in the industry right now.

23
00:01:52,803 --> 00:01:53,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Big stinky ones.

24
00:01:53,944 --> 00:01:57,426
[SPEAKER_09]: And now we're going to talk about some big acquisitions and things of that nature.

25
00:01:57,506 --> 00:01:58,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, what's up?

26
00:01:58,547 --> 00:02:01,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, tis the season to buy a company smaller than yours.

27
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Starting off here with THQ.

28
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,552
[SPEAKER_08]: They're acquiring Vigil Games.

29
00:02:07,853 --> 00:02:17,579
[SPEAKER_08]: For those probably not very familiar with Vigil Games, they created both Marvel's Uncanny X-Men and Battle Chasers series.

30
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,200
[SPEAKER_08]: And so...

31
00:02:21,018 --> 00:02:37,892
[SPEAKER_08]: It's part of the studio system strategy, which is designed to foster a singular vision and unique culture at each of our studios, according to Jack Sorensen, the executive vice president of the worldwide studios at THQ.

32
00:02:38,432 --> 00:02:45,858
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's basically to inject more of that creativity into their games, I guess, where it may be lacking.

33
00:02:48,382 --> 00:02:49,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you know what?

34
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:53,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, now that I think of it, THQ did create... I want to see the outfit.

35
00:02:53,187 --> 00:02:54,808
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, that game was pretty fun.

36
00:02:55,489 --> 00:03:06,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, speaking of bigger fish in the pond, Sony, they've signed a deal with PlayLogic for future first-party games, and that should be pretty interesting.

37
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:13,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, unfortunately, they haven't said what the game was, but it is slated to come out on PSP PlayStation 2...

38
00:03:14,352 --> 00:03:14,412
[SPEAKER_08]: E.A.

39
00:03:14,432 --> 00:03:16,133
[SPEAKER_08]: is purchasing Battlefield developer Digital Illusion CE

40
00:03:31,775 --> 00:03:32,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Battlefield 2 Demo March 24 Xbox Live

41
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:52,113
[SPEAKER_09]: The demo is actually going to have up to 24 players being able to play online.

42
00:03:52,433 --> 00:04:00,259
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is kind of cool that a lot of the Xbox Live demos lately have been, you know, these big multiplayer things like the outfit and all that stuff.

43
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:07,164
[SPEAKER_09]: So even though they're not my type of games, like I really tried, you guys, I tried to play Battlefield 2 because everybody was just raving about it, but it's just...

44
00:04:07,424 --> 00:04:09,045
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just not my type of game.

45
00:04:09,945 --> 00:04:11,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I'll check it out on Xbox Live.

46
00:04:11,445 --> 00:04:12,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell, if it's free, why not?

47
00:04:12,466 --> 00:04:13,006
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll check it out.

48
00:04:13,046 --> 00:04:17,287
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm going to suck, and I'm going to be a detriment to any team I'm on.

49
00:04:17,808 --> 00:04:18,708
[SPEAKER_09]: But check that out.

50
00:04:19,068 --> 00:04:21,029
[SPEAKER_09]: It's coming out for the Xbox 360 in April.

51
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:24,750
[SPEAKER_09]: April 11th or 12th

52
00:04:40,074 --> 00:04:42,017
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

53
00:04:57,856 --> 00:05:13,168
[SPEAKER_09]: and I haven't watched MTV in forever so I didn't even know they were making music videos in high def but I guess that makes sense just real quick the Xbox Live top 10 games of the week 10 needs first speed most wanted 9 the outfit demo 8 Battlefield 2 which is amazing because how is that

54
00:05:13,488 --> 00:05:14,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Already there.

55
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:16,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it the old one?

56
00:05:16,571 --> 00:05:17,712
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thinking the old one on Xbox.

57
00:05:18,433 --> 00:05:18,993
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what it is.

58
00:05:19,393 --> 00:05:22,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, and then seven, Project Gotham Racing 3.

59
00:05:22,676 --> 00:05:23,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Six, Dead or Alive 4.

60
00:05:24,678 --> 00:05:25,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Five, Perfect Dark Zero.

61
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Four, EA Sports Fight Night Round 3.

62
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:28,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Three, Call of Duty 2.

63
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Two, Ghost Recon 3.

64
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,165
[SPEAKER_09]: And number one is still Halo 2.

65
00:05:33,646 --> 00:05:36,629
[SPEAKER_09]: Should we start a betting pool on when Halo 2 will actually be dethroned?

66
00:05:37,284 --> 00:05:38,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Halo 3, Gears of War

67
00:06:04,485 --> 00:06:05,585
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the 24th was the day.

68
00:06:05,605 --> 00:06:06,366
[SPEAKER_09]: You got 10 days.

69
00:06:07,206 --> 00:06:09,127
[SPEAKER_09]: 10 days, Capcom, Xbox.

70
00:06:09,747 --> 00:06:10,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Get that stuff out there.

71
00:06:10,827 --> 00:06:11,408
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to play it.

72
00:06:12,668 --> 00:06:15,169
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, I want my achievement points for beating the game with Chun-Li 100%.

73
00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:19,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I heard that the reason why it wasn't out yet is because they're having trouble with lag.

74
00:06:19,951 --> 00:06:20,831
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of lag.

75
00:06:21,812 --> 00:06:22,992
[SPEAKER_09]: Or that horrible lag.

76
00:06:23,172 --> 00:06:29,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Fine, if they have to spend extra time to make it work good, then that's fine, because we don't want them releasing it and just patching it later to make up for it.

77
00:06:29,575 --> 00:06:32,356
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fine, but a status check would be nice.

78
00:06:32,936 --> 00:06:33,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

79
00:06:34,369 --> 00:06:38,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, moving on to another completely different topic.

80
00:06:38,171 --> 00:06:43,032
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, we were talking about Silent Hill a little bit in Part A, but this is not about the movie, necessarily.

81
00:06:43,473 --> 00:06:44,033
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of, sort of.

82
00:06:44,753 --> 00:06:54,437
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually a talk from 1UP stating that there's going to be a Silent Hill remake on the PS2.

83
00:06:56,758 --> 00:07:01,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Konami's been all happy over the talk about the movie, so there's a

84
00:07:02,526 --> 00:07:11,950
[SPEAKER_03]: A rumor that they are going to re-release the first game though with Harry Mason's wife, who is the heroine of the movie.

85
00:07:13,772 --> 00:07:15,353
[SPEAKER_09]: So it does have to do with the movie after all.

86
00:07:15,413 --> 00:07:17,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's sort of a tie-in.

87
00:07:17,175 --> 00:07:22,839
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that that's a good idea, but, you know, they'd have to make some changes.

88
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,301
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd have to be an alternate universe sort of thing.

89
00:07:25,662 --> 00:07:25,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

90
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:30,806
[SPEAKER_09]: Wouldn't that have to kind of come out, like, very soon, if they wanted it to promote the movie?

91
00:07:30,906 --> 00:07:32,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Or maybe they're going to wait for the DVD release?

92
00:07:32,647 --> 00:07:33,488
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

93
00:07:33,548 --> 00:07:37,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait for the DVD release, because you want to see how well the movie does first before you go and make a game about it.

94
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Wouldn't that be a great combo pack, though?

95
00:07:39,613 --> 00:07:40,554
[SPEAKER_09]: DVD and game?

96
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:41,134
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

97
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:42,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not?

98
00:07:42,891 --> 00:07:43,631
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they've tried it.

99
00:07:43,651 --> 00:07:44,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Sony does that?

100
00:07:44,351 --> 00:07:45,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no, I'm thinking of the PSP.

101
00:07:45,512 --> 00:07:47,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Sony did do that once.

102
00:07:47,612 --> 00:07:48,652
[SPEAKER_08]: They did, oh, what was it?

103
00:07:48,752 --> 00:07:51,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Stealth in the Wipeout Stealth, which, whoo!

104
00:07:51,713 --> 00:07:52,753
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that didn't sell very well.

105
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:53,873
[SPEAKER_08]: My bad, sorry.

106
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:55,393
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, stealth sucked.

107
00:07:56,453 --> 00:07:57,534
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll take your word for it.

108
00:07:57,934 --> 00:08:00,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this something you'd probably check out, Jamie, being a fan of Silent Hill?

109
00:08:00,534 --> 00:08:00,954
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, of course.

110
00:08:01,074 --> 00:08:01,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think I would, too.

111
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:03,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

112
00:08:03,435 --> 00:08:08,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though remakes can be a little ass sometimes, I mean, sometimes they're really good, and I think back to, of course, Mario Bros.

113
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,036
[SPEAKER_09]: All-Stars and the greatest remakes they ever did.

114
00:08:10,316 --> 00:08:10,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello?

115
00:08:11,653 --> 00:08:12,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Viva Piñata

116
00:08:36,943 --> 00:08:38,504
[SPEAKER_08]: Hooray Pinatas!

117
00:08:38,724 --> 00:08:45,907
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a game which is going to have a cartoon based on it about a living island of pinatas.

118
00:08:46,787 --> 00:08:49,128
[SPEAKER_08]: And what, may you ask, pinatas do?

119
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:59,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they have to fix this garden that has kind of gone awry and you have to lure your fellow pinatas to your garden.

120
00:09:00,996 --> 00:09:03,998
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what that second to last VG Cats was about.

121
00:09:04,138 --> 00:09:04,919
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't get it.

122
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,701
[SPEAKER_09]: It just all came together.

123
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:08,801
[SPEAKER_03]: It just dawned on me.

124
00:09:08,901 --> 00:09:09,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, it was so much fun.

125
00:09:09,742 --> 00:09:10,242
[SPEAKER_09]: So what is this?

126
00:09:10,563 --> 00:09:12,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Xbox's response to Animal Crossing, right?

127
00:09:12,984 --> 00:09:13,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Is the easy way to put it?

128
00:09:14,966 --> 00:09:15,086
[SPEAKER_08]: It's...

129
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:20,013
[SPEAKER_08]: They're trying to make a Pokemon, and goddammit, they're going to be damned if it'll happen.

130
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:22,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Because aren't they supposed to do like a TV show in all night?

131
00:09:22,555 --> 00:09:23,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

132
00:09:23,436 --> 00:09:23,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, boy.

133
00:09:24,476 --> 00:09:25,277
[SPEAKER_09]: A TV show.

134
00:09:25,297 --> 00:09:27,118
[SPEAKER_09]: About pinatas.

135
00:09:27,198 --> 00:09:32,923
[SPEAKER_09]: If I come into a town of Eva Pinata and start regulating with a baseball bat, will I get lots of candy?

136
00:09:33,383 --> 00:09:33,563
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

137
00:09:33,663 --> 00:09:35,745
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the only way I would want this game to come out.

138
00:09:36,005 --> 00:09:42,474
[SPEAKER_08]: If you could play a little kid who fucking goes around with a giant stick and beats the shit out of these stupid animals and steals their candy.

139
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:44,036
[SPEAKER_08]: That is the game I want.

140
00:09:44,477 --> 00:09:46,540
[SPEAKER_09]: God damn it, Grand Theft Pinata.

141
00:09:46,981 --> 00:09:52,689
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to ask, why all this hate for Viva Pinata before you've even... Have you seen the website?

142
00:09:53,357 --> 00:09:55,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, have you seen the website?

143
00:09:55,538 --> 00:09:57,439
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw screenshots, I have not seen the website.

144
00:09:57,459 --> 00:09:58,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you seen the website?

145
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,201
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I have not seen the website.

146
00:09:59,221 --> 00:09:59,981
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen screenshots of the game.

147
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:03,363
[SPEAKER_08]: The website is like some Shrek wannabe crap.

148
00:10:03,443 --> 00:10:04,744
[SPEAKER_08]: These characters come out.

149
00:10:05,124 --> 00:10:06,845
[SPEAKER_08]: They even, they're like, what the hell?

150
00:10:06,905 --> 00:10:08,586
[SPEAKER_08]: A game based on piñatas?

151
00:10:08,686 --> 00:10:11,928
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's seriously, I don't know.

152
00:10:12,008 --> 00:10:13,529
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounds like it could be innovative.

153
00:10:13,868 --> 00:10:23,652
[SPEAKER_08]: with the way they're doing Xbox Live where you can communicate with other players and send your pinatas to their stuff to kind of make it like Animal Crossing type of thing.

154
00:10:24,953 --> 00:10:26,813
[SPEAKER_08]: But really, it looks stupid.

155
00:10:27,454 --> 00:10:28,794
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks stupid.

156
00:10:30,455 --> 00:10:32,416
[SPEAKER_09]: We have chatters that disagree.

157
00:10:32,436 --> 00:10:34,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Xander C in our chatroom says, Viva Pinata looks awesome.

158
00:10:34,937 --> 00:10:35,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously.

159
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:39,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it just because maybe this isn't your kind of thing?

160
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:40,479
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

161
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:42,620
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Penny Arcade, not VGCats, by the way.

162
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:43,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

163
00:10:43,629 --> 00:10:44,429
[SPEAKER_08]: Pinyarkade.

164
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:45,830
[SPEAKER_08]: Their comic was hilarious.

165
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,871
[SPEAKER_08]: But no, seriously, I have seen the website.

166
00:10:49,292 --> 00:10:55,174
[SPEAKER_08]: I watched the little flash video that they have where they're doing screen tests of this Viva Pinata thing.

167
00:10:55,594 --> 00:10:58,396
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like it's a bad Pixar movie gone awry.

168
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:00,750
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

169
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,651
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be cool.

170
00:11:01,831 --> 00:11:03,491
[SPEAKER_08]: They could come out of nowhere and make it cool.

171
00:11:03,612 --> 00:11:04,272
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what?

172
00:11:04,392 --> 00:11:07,313
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is just going to be another failed attempt like Cameo.

173
00:11:07,553 --> 00:11:10,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Because Cameo, to be honest, wasn't that great of a game.

174
00:11:10,435 --> 00:11:11,555
[SPEAKER_08]: It was supposed to be a Zelda killer.

175
00:11:11,575 --> 00:11:13,056
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't quite a Zelda killer.

176
00:11:13,116 --> 00:11:13,956
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's not a Zelda killer.

177
00:11:14,056 --> 00:11:15,017
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an okay game.

178
00:11:15,437 --> 00:11:20,019
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty much, if you're an adventure gamer person, it's pretty much your only choice right now.

179
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:20,720
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's okay.

180
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,801
[SPEAKER_09]: It just feels like it could have been done on the regular Xbox.

181
00:11:23,841 --> 00:11:25,442
[SPEAKER_09]: It feels like there's really...

182
00:11:26,355 --> 00:11:30,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Fable was almost just the same type of thing in many ways.

183
00:11:31,001 --> 00:11:33,504
[SPEAKER_08]: Props are rare for at least trying something different.

184
00:11:34,545 --> 00:11:38,710
[SPEAKER_08]: The only problem is I don't like the idea of how they're putting out this cartoon thing to go with it.

185
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,053
[SPEAKER_08]: Because all they're trying to do is like, well kids like cartoons.

186
00:11:42,594 --> 00:11:44,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Cartoons sold Pokemon.

187
00:11:44,576 --> 00:11:45,778
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's... I mean...

188
00:11:47,088 --> 00:11:47,388
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

189
00:11:47,468 --> 00:11:47,829
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

190
00:11:48,349 --> 00:11:58,900
[SPEAKER_09]: I applaud them for doing something different besides the usual Xbox fare, which turns a lot of people off to the system, which is sports, shooters, and all those types of games.

191
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,044
[SPEAKER_09]: We need some more variety in the Xbox lineup, so I'm happy they're trying.

192
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:06,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Rare needs to just put out another goddamn Killer Instincts game.

193
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Can they, though?

194
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:09,851
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think they can.

195
00:12:10,506 --> 00:12:12,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, fine, make something else that's similar.

196
00:12:13,449 --> 00:12:16,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Just make another fighting game or something, or put out something really good.

197
00:12:18,133 --> 00:12:19,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, go to the website.

198
00:12:19,374 --> 00:12:22,797
[SPEAKER_08]: If you think I'm lying about how crappy this game is, go to the website.

199
00:12:22,817 --> 00:12:24,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Which most of our chatroom does disagree with me.

200
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:30,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, and go to the website, watch the video, and tell me if you're not pissed off at this game after you watch the video.

201
00:12:30,844 --> 00:12:31,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously.

202
00:12:31,525 --> 00:12:36,349
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a piñata game like a first-person shooter, so you go around and shoot the piñatas, and then you have to go cut the candy.

203
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:36,890
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get candy.

204
00:12:37,748 --> 00:12:41,429
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, you ready to inject some rage into this episode of Orange Launch Radio?

205
00:12:41,449 --> 00:12:42,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut up and play the music!

206
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:43,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright. ...

207
00:13:09,008 --> 00:13:13,572
[SPEAKER_03]: My FU of the week goes towards education.

208
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:29,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I've been having to deal with, I dropped a class, and then I have a, she's such a smart lady, a great teacher, but she tells us there's this assignment due and the assignment's not on the assignment page, it's just for each chapter, so what do we do?

209
00:13:30,074 --> 00:13:41,282
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it just bugs me that there's this expectation that we don't have lives outside of class, that we are given just buttloads of homework to do, and some of us work full-time, so what's up with that?

210
00:13:42,263 --> 00:13:46,266
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, it's not a very big FU, but that's what's been on my mind.

211
00:13:47,047 --> 00:13:47,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

212
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:49,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, your FU.

213
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,771
[SPEAKER_08]: My FU is the bad drivers.

214
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:53,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, get this.

215
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:58,495
[SPEAKER_08]: I was driving down the freeway today, going to go check out Tux's for the wedding.

216
00:13:59,158 --> 00:14:02,580
[SPEAKER_08]: and I see some dumbass pulling off to the side of the road.

217
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:07,384
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, because he missed his intersection or turn or whatever off the freeway.

218
00:14:08,244 --> 00:14:12,167
[SPEAKER_07]: The friggin' idiot starts backing up on the freeway.

219
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:13,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Backing up.

220
00:14:13,568 --> 00:14:15,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Flipped the goddamn thing in the reverse.

221
00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:16,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Who was driving?

222
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, goddamn woman in a fucking SUV.

223
00:14:18,631 --> 00:14:19,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Bad.

224
00:14:20,552 --> 00:14:21,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Bad people.

225
00:14:23,094 --> 00:14:23,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Was she on her phone?

226
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:32,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, she probably was, but I didn't bother to look because there was a giant trail of smoke from her skidding into the goddamn side of the road there.

227
00:14:33,351 --> 00:14:36,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Stupid people out there, and I see it daily.

228
00:14:38,257 --> 00:14:38,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Curses.

229
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,683
[SPEAKER_09]: My FU would go to Weekends.

230
00:14:43,576 --> 00:14:46,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Or should I say actually the work week, because weekends aren't long enough.

231
00:14:46,378 --> 00:14:53,462
[SPEAKER_09]: I really feel like I haven't done, I mean, don't get me wrong, I've actually done a lot, a lot of stuff this weekend, but not enough.

232
00:14:53,522 --> 00:15:02,728
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of wish there was more time in the weekend, because I really have had no time to just kind of lie on the couch and go, I'm just relaxing today.

233
00:15:03,549 --> 00:15:08,452
[SPEAKER_09]: So F you to our society only allowing us two days on the weekend.

234
00:15:08,472 --> 00:15:09,072
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's crap.

235
00:15:10,236 --> 00:15:13,137
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we should work for two days in a week and get a five-day weekend.

236
00:15:13,157 --> 00:15:13,638
[SPEAKER_09]: That would rock.

237
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,259
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, I'm just lazy.

238
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,161
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still on the topic of pinata, by the way.

239
00:15:21,081 --> 00:15:22,842
[SPEAKER_09]: They still can't get over that pinata thing, huh?

240
00:15:22,862 --> 00:15:28,325
[SPEAKER_03]: We now have Grand Theft Pinata, Metal Gear Pinata, Katamari Pinata.

241
00:15:30,706 --> 00:15:30,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Fun.

242
00:15:31,547 --> 00:15:34,648
[SPEAKER_09]: They always take one gag a week and run with it, don't they, in chat?

243
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:38,030
[SPEAKER_09]: You did not just bring up the Viva Pinata website over there.

244
00:15:41,247 --> 00:15:42,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

245
00:15:43,528 --> 00:15:44,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it does look like a Shrek ripoff.

246
00:15:44,989 --> 00:15:45,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

247
00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:46,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

248
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we'll see.

249
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,750
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll check it out later.

250
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:48,430
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so funny!

251
00:15:48,671 --> 00:15:49,351
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll check it out later.

252
00:15:49,371 --> 00:15:49,631
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

253
00:15:50,311 --> 00:15:51,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, I want to get on to another topic here.

254
00:15:52,232 --> 00:15:55,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Kotaku.com has recently posted some images.

255
00:15:55,834 --> 00:15:56,034
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

256
00:15:56,857 --> 00:16:00,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Pinata Mamie, 2DX I thought you were laughing at Kotaku.

257
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,261
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, that's not very nice.

258
00:16:02,301 --> 00:16:03,182
[SPEAKER_09]: They're a respected site.

259
00:16:04,503 --> 00:16:15,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Kotaku.com recently posted some pictures, you have to go back to March 15th though, of the Game Boy Advance SP in pretty pink, now with a brighter backlit screen.

260
00:16:15,992 --> 00:16:20,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Or should I say, pearly pink is actually the color they're going for there.

261
00:16:22,418 --> 00:16:22,858
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

262
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:26,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Why do you think that they might be trying to release a pink Game Boy?

263
00:16:26,823 --> 00:16:29,944
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not getting enough female players.

264
00:16:29,984 --> 00:16:33,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Because all females buy anything that's pink.

265
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,246
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, it's bred into their DNA.

266
00:16:36,766 --> 00:16:38,986
[SPEAKER_09]: I know a lot of males that would be interested in the pink system.

267
00:16:40,287 --> 00:16:42,467
[SPEAKER_09]: I know a lot of males that would be interested in the pink system.

268
00:16:42,507 --> 00:16:49,769
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just, not the typical mindset that a lot of game companies cater to.

269
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:50,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's just leave it at that.

270
00:16:50,749 --> 00:16:52,710
[SPEAKER_03]: My Game Boy Advance, however, was pink.

271
00:16:53,957 --> 00:16:57,618
[SPEAKER_03]: I did it just so that people couldn't pin me down to any one particular thing.

272
00:16:58,138 --> 00:16:58,518
[SPEAKER_09]: Gotcha.

273
00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:00,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

274
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:02,239
[SPEAKER_03]: I also have an afterburner in it.

275
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:08,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, I really only brought that up so we could tie into our next story that's going to be brought to us by DarkSakura.

276
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, it's actually our website of the week.

277
00:17:11,921 --> 00:17:13,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, our website of the week.

278
00:17:13,381 --> 00:17:14,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here we go then.

279
00:17:14,562 --> 00:17:15,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's bring in the theme music.

280
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:22,999
[SPEAKER_09]: You like to surf the internet and find a great website for us every week, don't you?

281
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:28,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, this one was linked to me by a friend of mine.

282
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:37,882
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on The Escapist, and the article can be found at www.escapistmagazine.com slash issue slash 17 slash 27.

283
00:17:38,422 --> 00:17:42,583
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, oh my god, girls don't exist on the interweb.

284
00:17:42,723 --> 00:17:43,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Exclamation point one.

285
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:47,023
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll go ahead and read off just the first paragraph.

286
00:17:47,063 --> 00:17:48,984
[SPEAKER_03]: It's by somebody named...

287
00:17:49,887 --> 00:17:50,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Whitney Butts.

288
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:52,728
[SPEAKER_03]: I am a girl on the internet.

289
00:17:52,788 --> 00:17:53,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I said it.

290
00:17:53,628 --> 00:17:54,428
[SPEAKER_03]: A girl on the internet.

291
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,949
[SPEAKER_03]: There really are quite a few of us.

292
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:56,709
[SPEAKER_03]: I can type.

293
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:58,130
[SPEAKER_03]: I can play games with the best of you.

294
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,490
[SPEAKER_03]: And you, my friend, are about to get owned by a girl.

295
00:18:02,271 --> 00:18:16,235
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically the story of somebody who's been playing World of Warcraft and no one believed that she was a girl or thought that she was like a girl speaking for her boyfriend on the chat or was like, you know, not.

296
00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:17,235
[SPEAKER_03]: She's very pretty.

297
00:18:17,356 --> 00:18:18,436
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a picture of her on the site.

298
00:18:18,476 --> 00:18:18,636
[SPEAKER_03]: She's

299
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:25,677
[SPEAKER_09]: I read the article when you posted it on our secret place that we put all the stories up.

300
00:18:26,618 --> 00:18:28,719
[SPEAKER_09]: I read it and I thought it was very interesting.

301
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:33,083
[SPEAKER_09]: The IRC conversations that she posted in those chat logs.

302
00:18:33,143 --> 00:18:35,305
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, I actually wanted to do it.

303
00:18:35,325 --> 00:18:38,367
[SPEAKER_09]: We didn't have enough time to prepare it, but I actually wanted to do IRC theater.

304
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:47,370
[SPEAKER_09]: We were going to interact the dialogue here, but it's just amazing the, for lack of a better word, stupidity of people.

305
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:51,211
[SPEAKER_09]: My mother used to use this term a lot, and I hated it then, but it's the only way I can think of to describe this.

306
00:18:51,712 --> 00:18:57,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Hard-headedness of the youth that, OMG, she's a girl.

307
00:18:57,914 --> 00:18:59,014
[SPEAKER_03]: I got it on Rock and Rock.

308
00:18:59,795 --> 00:19:00,655
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just amazing.

309
00:19:00,675 --> 00:19:03,716
[SPEAKER_03]: It's either that or...

310
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:12,552
[SPEAKER_03]: I would get it every so often back when I was a moderator on DDR Freak.

311
00:19:12,612 --> 00:19:15,794
[SPEAKER_03]: It was either, oh my god, you're a girl, or oh my god, you're not Asian.

312
00:19:17,755 --> 00:19:20,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because that's a stereotype that only Asians play DDR.

313
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, you're not an Asian boy!

314
00:19:24,118 --> 00:19:25,679
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually got it when I played Tetranet.

315
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:36,614
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would actually, when I used to list my video game collection on places, people go, you can't have all that because you're a girl.

316
00:19:37,354 --> 00:19:37,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

317
00:19:39,496 --> 00:19:47,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Where is there some type of law that says I can't be good at video games and I can't enjoy video games because I have boobs and a uterus?

318
00:19:48,802 --> 00:19:50,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, where is that law?

319
00:19:50,604 --> 00:19:52,505
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to see it so that I can set it on fire.

320
00:19:54,395 --> 00:20:06,703
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what, it's interesting because there was also one of those IRC logs talked about where she responded that she said something about like, ooh, I really like Johnny Depp or something, and one of the people said, that's gay, what are you, gay?

321
00:20:07,143 --> 00:20:10,465
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was kind of like, so what if it was a gay person?

322
00:20:10,505 --> 00:20:19,211
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, obviously as a gay gamer myself, I face sometimes a lot of these same types of issues that you're bringing up as well where people like go,

323
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:20,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh, you're actually gay?

324
00:20:21,031 --> 00:20:22,992
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they'll shut up for a long time.

325
00:20:23,532 --> 00:20:29,974
[SPEAKER_09]: Or sometimes I've gotten that where it's like, you're gay, you shouldn't be playing video games.

326
00:20:30,114 --> 00:20:34,055
[SPEAKER_09]: You should be being in a musical and listening to Barbra Streisand.

327
00:20:34,075 --> 00:20:37,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me be the first to tell you, I fucking hate Barbra Streisand.

328
00:20:37,996 --> 00:20:39,877
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate her, I hate her music, I hate her movies.

329
00:20:40,237 --> 00:20:41,817
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate everything about Barbra Streisand.

330
00:20:41,838 --> 00:20:43,118
[SPEAKER_09]: She's like butter.

331
00:20:43,718 --> 00:20:44,878
[SPEAKER_09]: No, she's like shit.

332
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:47,059
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't like her at all.

333
00:20:47,459 --> 00:20:50,400
[SPEAKER_09]: My mom likes her a lot, but that's my mom.

334
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,421
[SPEAKER_09]: It's those types of stereotypes I really hate.

335
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:54,141
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, so what if I'm gay?

336
00:20:54,181 --> 00:20:55,982
[SPEAKER_09]: I can play video games just like anybody else.

337
00:20:56,242 --> 00:20:57,242
[SPEAKER_09]: So what if you're a girl?

338
00:20:58,123 --> 00:20:59,163
[SPEAKER_09]: We've all got hands.

339
00:20:59,483 --> 00:21:01,244
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all you need to use a controller, right?

340
00:21:02,224 --> 00:21:06,105
[SPEAKER_09]: And apologies to any of you guys who might have had amputation or something.

341
00:21:06,445 --> 00:21:07,686
[SPEAKER_09]: There's devices for you too.

342
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:11,507
[SPEAKER_03]: I've actually seen someone play with a joystick using their chin.

343
00:21:13,332 --> 00:21:16,253
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's also another thing I want to read on here.

344
00:21:16,794 --> 00:21:27,999
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, just because a girl plays video games doesn't necessarily mean she's going to instantly put her picture up on the internet for the male population to drool over because it's a woman that plays a game.

345
00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:32,340
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go ahead and quote her on this again, if nobody minds.

346
00:21:33,421 --> 00:21:40,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, a girl who doesn't show her picture on the internet is not a girl, and the only girls on the internet are actually guys who are just trying to get free stuff.

347
00:21:40,584 --> 00:21:42,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me wrong, I haven't gotten free stuff before.

348
00:21:42,986 --> 00:21:45,547
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I have gotten free stuff before, but I don't solicit it.

349
00:21:45,867 --> 00:21:48,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Not like those, quote, girls who sit around dancing for tips and games.

350
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,611
[SPEAKER_03]: You know who you are, and you know you're not a real girl.

351
00:21:51,691 --> 00:21:53,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Real girls don't exist on the internet.

352
00:21:53,192 --> 00:22:08,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, FYI, guys, if you think every girl that you run into in an MMO is actually a girl, just like if you assume that every guy you run into on an MMO is actually a guy, you are an idiot.

353
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,731
[SPEAKER_03]: I've played male characters before.

354
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:12,692
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've played female characters before.

355
00:22:13,112 --> 00:22:14,993
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not because I'm gay.

356
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:19,155
[SPEAKER_03]: On my Ragnarok account, I played a male so that I could play a bard.

357
00:22:19,835 --> 00:22:25,158
[SPEAKER_09]: How many of you guys out there, how many of you straight men out there, have ever played Street Fighter 2 as Chun-Li?

358
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:27,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Did that make you gay?

359
00:22:27,859 --> 00:22:27,999
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

360
00:22:28,969 --> 00:22:29,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

361
00:22:41,178 --> 00:22:41,939
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop it.

362
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:52,105
[SPEAKER_03]: But the whole thing just really gets me because, and I have, you know, being a female gamer, it's even worse though being a female gamer with a voice in the community though.

363
00:22:52,485 --> 00:22:59,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, I've gotten some hate mail from people who have literally told me to get off the radio and get back in the kitchen.

364
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:04,572
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck century is this?

365
00:23:04,672 --> 00:23:05,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me.

366
00:23:06,562 --> 00:23:16,067
[SPEAKER_03]: What backwards-ass country did you grow up in where they still have Neanderthals in charge banging women on the head and dragging them around by their hair to make them go cook them dinner?

367
00:23:17,568 --> 00:23:19,609
[SPEAKER_09]: No, seriously, DarkSakura is a pretty good cook.

368
00:23:20,029 --> 00:23:20,909
[SPEAKER_09]: I will give her that.

369
00:23:21,229 --> 00:23:25,472
[SPEAKER_03]: I am an excellent cook, but then again, you know, that's not the point.

370
00:23:25,592 --> 00:23:26,512
[SPEAKER_03]: I also don't clean house.

371
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:28,153
[SPEAKER_03]: I make my husband do it.

372
00:23:28,213 --> 00:23:28,973
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a house husband.

373
00:23:29,213 --> 00:23:29,454
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

374
00:23:29,594 --> 00:23:30,174
[SPEAKER_03]: No, for real.

375
00:23:30,614 --> 00:23:32,055
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but the thing is, you know,

376
00:23:34,832 --> 00:23:40,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Even my husband's friends are a bit surprised that I'll go in there every so often and play games with them.

377
00:23:41,195 --> 00:23:43,216
[SPEAKER_03]: And regularly own people.

378
00:23:43,816 --> 00:23:48,338
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to say, when Tekken 3 was out, I was the goddess of Tekken.

379
00:23:48,378 --> 00:23:49,458
[SPEAKER_03]: And I used to go in there.

380
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:50,619
[SPEAKER_09]: And so humble about it.

381
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:51,459
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true.

382
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:54,820
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to go in there and smoke all the boys.

383
00:23:54,921 --> 00:23:56,801
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'd be like, oh my god, I got beat by a girl.

384
00:23:57,582 --> 00:23:59,082
[SPEAKER_03]: This is also Alabama, but still.

385
00:23:59,642 --> 00:24:03,124
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember going into Cyber Station one day, the same one I worked at.

386
00:24:04,179 --> 00:24:07,421
[SPEAKER_03]: and we had the brand new Deluxe Tekken 3 there.

387
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:10,563
[SPEAKER_03]: And these guys have been there since the store opened at 9 a.m.

388
00:24:10,623 --> 00:24:11,844
[SPEAKER_03]: I show up at 2 in the afternoon.

389
00:24:11,864 --> 00:24:14,505
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been doing nothing but playing King all day, doing the throw combos.

390
00:24:14,905 --> 00:24:17,147
[SPEAKER_03]: I go in there with Jin and just knock him off the machine.

391
00:24:18,528 --> 00:24:22,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't somebody actually tell you once, like, oh my god, it's the girl that plays Tekken?

392
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:22,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

393
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:26,552
[SPEAKER_09]: Like you're the girl, the only girl in the United States that's ever played Tekken.

394
00:24:26,572 --> 00:24:28,313
[SPEAKER_03]: I went back to Alabama.

395
00:24:28,714 --> 00:24:28,954
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-huh.

396
00:24:29,978 --> 00:24:36,160
[SPEAKER_03]: and ran into somebody at the arcade and I was like, yeah, I used to come in here all the time and play Tekken.

397
00:24:36,381 --> 00:24:38,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, you're that girl that plays Tekken!

398
00:24:38,862 --> 00:24:42,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you're the only girl in the universe that's ever played Tekken.

399
00:24:42,243 --> 00:24:44,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently I had been talked about for a little bit after I left.

400
00:24:44,944 --> 00:24:49,666
[SPEAKER_03]: I also was the one on campus who used to beat people on, because we had a Darkstalkers machine.

401
00:24:49,706 --> 00:24:50,606
[SPEAKER_03]: That used to be my game.

402
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:51,787
[SPEAKER_03]: That and Killer Instinct.

403
00:24:53,267 --> 00:24:55,028
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, it gets me that

404
00:24:55,504 --> 00:24:58,266
[SPEAKER_03]: There's this whole thing that girls can't play games like that.

405
00:24:58,686 --> 00:25:01,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Either that or the girls who are like the uber sluts.

406
00:25:02,228 --> 00:25:07,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this ties into the next article that I'm going to bring up here, which I'm sure will piss you off a little bit.

407
00:25:08,092 --> 00:25:08,432
[SPEAKER_09]: Here it is.

408
00:25:08,892 --> 00:25:12,335
[SPEAKER_09]: It's located at www.kimrom.info is the little blog.

409
00:25:12,695 --> 00:25:14,516
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's the blog post from March 8th.

410
00:25:14,996 --> 00:25:17,538
[SPEAKER_09]: And it goes, Female Gaming My Ass.

411
00:25:19,008 --> 00:25:28,490
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think I get the point that they're trying to make in this article because they talk about like, you know, they show these pictures, especially like here it is, like a girl website, a girl gaming website.

412
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:34,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Quote, another great example of how female gaming attracts attention is a new team who calls themselves Can't Touch This.

413
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,392
[SPEAKER_09]: The image below is their new homepage design.

414
00:25:37,772 --> 00:25:44,194
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, it's totally an exploitation of women's site and it's pink and it shows like a girl in a bikini, a little butt.

415
00:25:44,514 --> 00:25:48,095
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think what's kind of amusing is that they put a response like if it was a guy site.

416
00:25:48,911 --> 00:25:49,391
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

417
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:14,146
[SPEAKER_09]: and I can totally see where this would piss someone off.

418
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,146
[SPEAKER_09]: This is stupid.

419
00:26:15,327 --> 00:26:15,607
[SPEAKER_09]: It's right.

420
00:26:15,647 --> 00:26:28,376
[SPEAKER_09]: The sensationalism of girls playing video games just because they're girls and showing off the tits and everything and like OMG this is what a girl playing a game looks like and when you run into a girl team they're all going to be babes and stuff.

421
00:26:28,516 --> 00:26:31,118
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's just that's stupid.

422
00:26:31,318 --> 00:26:32,019
[SPEAKER_09]: That's stupidity.

423
00:26:32,139 --> 00:26:33,420
[SPEAKER_09]: And I agree with that portion of the article.

424
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,421
[SPEAKER_08]: How the hell are you going to operate the mouse if you're holding a gun?

425
00:26:35,502 --> 00:26:36,402
[SPEAKER_08]: That doesn't work.

426
00:26:37,103 --> 00:26:38,023
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the problem.

427
00:26:38,744 --> 00:26:39,464
[SPEAKER_09]: The article

428
00:26:40,379 --> 00:26:47,303
[SPEAKER_09]: was written like, and this is my opinion here guys, but I think the article was written so trashy and so sensationalistic.

429
00:26:47,323 --> 00:26:50,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me give you a way that the article opens up here.

430
00:26:51,085 --> 00:26:53,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Men are better at computer games than women.

431
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:54,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Big surprise.

432
00:26:54,366 --> 00:27:01,610
[SPEAKER_09]: We grow up playing games, we spend enormous amounts of time playing games, we consciously dedicate time to better ourselves, and we are competitive by nature.

433
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,871
[SPEAKER_09]: No wonder we're better gamers.

434
00:27:03,591 --> 00:27:05,212
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm thinking like, okay.

435
00:27:07,051 --> 00:27:13,916
[SPEAKER_09]: You've never seen a woman who's obsessed with soccer playing soccer, because those bitches are some of the most competitive women I've ever seen in my life.

436
00:27:13,996 --> 00:27:14,836
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, seriously.

437
00:27:15,297 --> 00:27:20,120
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, just these broad generalizations that the person's making here to open.

438
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:32,608
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if they're doing this for shock value or something, but it just totally, like, when I read it and it opened up with that, it totally, like, I was like, okay, I don't even, even if there's a point in here somewhere, it's lost on me.

439
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,841
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, I'm sure you felt similarly.

440
00:27:35,081 --> 00:27:36,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I did actually reply to this guy.

441
00:27:37,082 --> 00:27:37,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh!

442
00:27:38,462 --> 00:27:41,163
[SPEAKER_03]: He actually replied to me too, but he was just saying more of the same.

443
00:27:41,663 --> 00:27:51,467
[SPEAKER_03]: I listed an itemized bit, and actually what I first started off saying is I wasn't going to dignify this poor excuse for an editorial with a response, but perhaps I have a small responsibility to do so.

444
00:27:51,627 --> 00:27:53,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Nor were we going to talk about it on the show.

445
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:53,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Oops!

446
00:27:54,948 --> 00:27:58,930
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I think that this guy's idiocy should be pointed out because...

447
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:02,826
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an attitude that's prevalent, though.

448
00:28:02,886 --> 00:28:08,608
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand wanting to see less of the, quote, hoochie gamers.

449
00:28:09,408 --> 00:28:14,170
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's like I pointed out, he's basically going from his male ego.

450
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:15,410
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all he was speaking from.

451
00:28:15,811 --> 00:28:16,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's another quote.

452
00:28:16,491 --> 00:28:25,394
[SPEAKER_09]: But the real problem with female gaming is that female gamers in general have the same ambitions as men, but they lack the dedication and drive to fulfill those ambitions.

453
00:28:26,386 --> 00:28:27,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, what?

454
00:28:31,748 --> 00:28:33,769
[SPEAKER_09]: Let that quote speak for itself there.

455
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:38,611
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's just like, you know, I know plenty of women who are very high level.

456
00:28:38,651 --> 00:28:49,615
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, there was just an article that was floating the internet this week about one of the girls who was on season seven of Buffy, one of the other Slayers, is secretly a level 60 character in World of Warcraft.

457
00:28:50,447 --> 00:28:51,327
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm like, you know what?

458
00:28:51,487 --> 00:28:56,109
[SPEAKER_09]: Girls can have that ambition and drive to succeed in a game just like any guy.

459
00:28:56,429 --> 00:29:01,911
[SPEAKER_09]: But you can't ever say all girls and you can't ever say all men because you're going to be wrong.

460
00:29:02,091 --> 00:29:10,494
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my co-workers regularly talks to the guy in the cubicle across from me about her level, what, close to 70 character on World of Warcraft?

461
00:29:11,695 --> 00:29:15,518
[SPEAKER_03]: and she's been wanting me to pay for my accounts again.

462
00:29:16,298 --> 00:29:22,082
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a friend who's like the C-Mode goddess in Phantasy Star Online.

463
00:29:22,102 --> 00:29:24,024
[SPEAKER_03]: She just goes in there and smokes people.

464
00:29:24,884 --> 00:29:25,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is it?

465
00:29:26,245 --> 00:29:26,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Why can't...

466
00:29:29,344 --> 00:29:30,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do guys think this?

467
00:29:30,504 --> 00:29:37,367
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm not saying that all guys think this, but it does seem to be a pretty prevalent misconception among male gamers.

468
00:29:37,407 --> 00:29:50,892
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, where did this... I honestly, and I hate to, I don't want to turn around the whole sexist thing myself, but I honestly think that a whole big chunk of it is male ego being threatened by women being able to do something.

469
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:52,673
[SPEAKER_09]: No, some of it is.

470
00:29:53,933 --> 00:29:54,393
[SPEAKER_09]: I would agree.

471
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:55,293
[SPEAKER_09]: As a guy, I would agree.

472
00:29:55,333 --> 00:29:56,794
[SPEAKER_09]: But granted, you know, whatever.

473
00:29:56,814 --> 00:29:58,514
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess my perspective on things is different.

474
00:29:58,534 --> 00:30:04,336
[SPEAKER_09]: But it sounds to me – and I understand this guy's underlying point is that maybe there's a little bit of – he's a little –

475
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:08,258
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want her representative of my fellow female gamers.

476
00:30:36,294 --> 00:30:37,516
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to go lay on this.

477
00:30:37,636 --> 00:30:39,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, form your own opinions.

478
00:30:40,199 --> 00:30:44,826
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to bring it up because, like it or not, it is an article that's been circulating a lot of the big news sites this week.

479
00:30:44,906 --> 00:30:46,107
[SPEAKER_09]: So check it out if you want.

480
00:30:46,288 --> 00:30:48,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Camerom.info and blog for March 8th.

481
00:30:50,243 --> 00:30:54,965
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure some of you guys want to respond to that, so we are going to open up our Skype line at this time.

482
00:30:55,025 --> 00:30:59,407
[SPEAKER_09]: If you guys want to give us a call, you can give us a call on our Skype line.

483
00:30:59,427 --> 00:31:07,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Just go to interactwithus on www.orangeloungeradio.com, or you can actually give us a telephone call as well.

484
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,930
[SPEAKER_09]: The telephone number is 916-

485
00:31:14,513 --> 00:31:15,254
[SPEAKER_09]: and 226-9067.

00:31:15,634 --> 00:31:25,840
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember that that could be a toll call, so please ask the permission of whoever runs the line before you actually give us a call because there might be charges incurred.

487
00:31:26,181 --> 00:31:27,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to the phones.

488
00:31:27,141 --> 00:31:28,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, they're lighting up tonight.

489
00:31:28,262 --> 00:31:30,003
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's start off with you.

490
00:31:30,063 --> 00:31:31,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

491
00:31:32,945 --> 00:31:33,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

492
00:31:34,246 --> 00:31:34,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

493
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:35,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, who's this?

494
00:31:38,058 --> 00:31:40,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Raven's Dolphin Well, there's lots of games that come out for it.

495
00:31:56,038 --> 00:31:58,779
[SPEAKER_09]: There are a lot of games that come out for the PSP, I'll give you that.

496
00:31:58,819 --> 00:32:02,980
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm going to be honest, there just hasn't been a whole lot that's really been that exciting to me.

497
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:06,941
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's not to say that there isn't stuff coming up that's exciting to me.

498
00:32:07,021 --> 00:32:10,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Such as, well, the Mega Man games were just released, and I still need to check those out.

499
00:32:10,543 --> 00:32:11,943
[SPEAKER_09]: But of course, me and my Katamari.

500
00:32:12,783 --> 00:32:16,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Luminous, I named as my game of the year last year, was a PSP game.

501
00:32:16,965 --> 00:32:19,345
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, there are things to like about the PSP.

502
00:32:19,745 --> 00:32:21,466
[SPEAKER_09]: I just think that you can't...

503
00:32:22,726 --> 00:32:26,147
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not existing just to be a game system.

504
00:32:26,467 --> 00:32:36,690
[SPEAKER_09]: They're also trying to do a lot of other stuff with it, such as the built-in web stuff and the podcast downloads and the Flash being incorporated into it and the iToy and all that other stuff as well.

505
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:39,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

506
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,891
[SPEAKER_09]: Was there anything else you wanted to say about that?

507
00:32:42,731 --> 00:32:43,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I do.

508
00:32:44,091 --> 00:32:46,012
[SPEAKER_09]: I bought Mega Man, the two of them.

509
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:48,460
[SPEAKER_09]: What did you think about that?

510
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,824
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a little bit of lag, so just feel free to speak freely.

511
00:32:50,864 --> 00:32:51,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Give your thoughts on that.

512
00:32:52,507 --> 00:32:53,309
[SPEAKER_09]: I loved them both.

513
00:32:53,529 --> 00:32:55,052
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought Powered Up was the best.

514
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:56,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm definitely going to have to check it out.

515
00:32:57,476 --> 00:33:00,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you can download maps from it from their own servers.

516
00:33:01,428 --> 00:33:17,335
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's kind of cool, and that's something, you know, that the DS doesn't do, is, like, the whole, like, I mean, it's just now starting to get into the online interactivity thing, so, you know, Nintendo still has a long way to grow in that department, but, of course, you know, Metroid Prime Hunters is exciting, but I like, you know, I like that idea of all the expansions and all that stuff.

517
00:33:17,735 --> 00:33:19,896
[SPEAKER_09]: But, anyway, Raven's Dolphin, thank you so much for the call.

518
00:33:19,936 --> 00:33:27,259
[SPEAKER_09]: We are going to have to go ahead and let you go, because we're getting a little too much lag there, but, and we got a lot of calls on the line tonight, so we want to go to another caller there, but...

519
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:28,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

520
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello?

521
00:33:56,772 --> 00:33:58,033
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

522
00:33:59,133 --> 00:33:59,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello?

523
00:34:00,254 --> 00:34:00,634
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello?

524
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:01,634
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, who's this?

525
00:34:02,515 --> 00:34:04,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, this is Speck.

526
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:06,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Speck, what's on your mind?

527
00:34:06,437 --> 00:34:08,698
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a little bit of lag, so just go ahead and get your question out.

528
00:34:09,518 --> 00:34:12,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, sorry about this.

529
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,260
[SPEAKER_09]: That's alright, what's on your mind, buddy?

530
00:34:14,421 --> 00:34:15,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead and get your question out.

531
00:34:16,072 --> 00:34:23,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I do want to say that the biggest April Fool's joke was probably the Nintendo On, if you guys ever heard about that.

532
00:34:23,974 --> 00:34:25,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell us a little bit about this.

533
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,655
[SPEAKER_09]: I vaguely remember this, but tell us about this joke.

534
00:34:28,435 --> 00:34:36,377
[SPEAKER_04]: It was someone had, right before E3, had put together this huge trailer saying what the revolution was.

535
00:34:38,457 --> 00:34:41,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I think, I think, wasn't this like kind of last year that they did something like this?

536
00:34:41,418 --> 00:34:45,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, this is like, um, I think around Tokyo Game Show, something like that?

537
00:34:45,819 --> 00:34:46,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, interesting.

538
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:50,640
[SPEAKER_09]: So, so what do you, what in your mind made this the greatest April Fool's prank in your opinion?

539
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it made people actually believed it.

540
00:34:54,601 --> 00:34:55,181
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess that's true.

541
00:34:55,221 --> 00:34:56,781
[SPEAKER_09]: It did run on a lot of gaming sites, so.

542
00:34:56,881 --> 00:34:58,462
[SPEAKER_04]: That's success if you're any joke.

543
00:34:58,502 --> 00:35:02,122
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the success of a joke, and one of many reasons why I hate April Fool's Day.

544
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:04,703
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and also, Jamie, I just have,

545
00:35:05,467 --> 00:35:06,809
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my friends wanted to say something to you.

546
00:35:07,069 --> 00:35:07,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

547
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:07,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

548
00:35:08,531 --> 00:35:09,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Sega rocks.

549
00:35:10,214 --> 00:35:10,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

550
00:35:11,475 --> 00:35:17,063
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't... Did... It was either DarkSakura rocks or fuck off.

551
00:35:17,123 --> 00:35:18,786
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't tell which one of the two it was.

552
00:35:19,467 --> 00:35:20,848
[SPEAKER_04]: He said Sega rocks.

553
00:35:21,209 --> 00:35:21,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

554
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:22,030
[SPEAKER_09]: So you rock.

555
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:22,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

556
00:35:23,683 --> 00:35:25,084
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, take care, buddy.

557
00:35:25,364 --> 00:35:25,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good one.

558
00:35:27,727 --> 00:35:28,587
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, take care, buddy.

559
00:35:28,607 --> 00:35:29,308
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got to let you go.

560
00:35:29,548 --> 00:35:31,930
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got a lot of lag there, but thanks for calling in.

561
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,191
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got some first-time callers tonight.

562
00:35:33,211 --> 00:35:33,712
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.

563
00:35:34,112 --> 00:35:35,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to another call.

564
00:35:36,014 --> 00:35:37,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

565
00:35:39,697 --> 00:35:40,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, caller, are you there?

566
00:35:40,518 --> 00:35:41,518
[SPEAKER_09]: You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

567
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,301
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it says Sega Rocks.

568
00:35:44,321 --> 00:35:44,981
[SPEAKER_03]: That's still cool.

569
00:35:46,242 --> 00:35:46,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

570
00:35:47,714 --> 00:35:52,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, unfortunately I'm not hearing from this guy, so maybe your mic was down or something was going on there.

571
00:35:52,236 --> 00:35:54,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to another call.

572
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:57,077
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

573
00:35:58,418 --> 00:35:58,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

574
00:35:59,098 --> 00:35:59,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, who's this?

575
00:36:01,419 --> 00:36:02,740
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Nintendo Maniac 64.

576
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendo Maniac 64, what is on your mind?

577
00:36:06,721 --> 00:36:10,983
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Sakura likes me or something, I don't know.

578
00:36:11,143 --> 00:36:11,803
[SPEAKER_05]: She's saying woohoo.

579
00:36:13,153 --> 00:36:14,134
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you're fairly cool.

580
00:36:14,274 --> 00:36:16,495
[SPEAKER_09]: We're fans of you because you're fans of us.

581
00:36:16,595 --> 00:36:18,316
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why we cheer you when you come on.

582
00:36:18,396 --> 00:36:19,257
[SPEAKER_09]: So, what's up, buddy?

583
00:36:20,337 --> 00:36:24,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Um... Not much, except... Can I rant about this one friend of mine?

584
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,601
[SPEAKER_05]: I suppose.

585
00:36:26,681 --> 00:36:27,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it gaming-related?

586
00:36:29,342 --> 00:36:30,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm, kinda.

587
00:36:30,283 --> 00:36:34,805
[SPEAKER_09]: He's... He's... Well, okay, he's a pretty big PS tool.

588
00:36:35,306 --> 00:36:37,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so tell us... Okay, get the rant out.

589
00:36:39,688 --> 00:36:40,829
[SPEAKER_05]: He just, like, always...

590
00:36:41,721 --> 00:36:44,923
[SPEAKER_05]: This is like Nintendo and Xbox, just like everyone else.

591
00:36:45,684 --> 00:36:47,405
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's not Sony, this is it.

592
00:36:48,325 --> 00:36:48,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

593
00:36:49,987 --> 00:36:50,647
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

594
00:36:53,749 --> 00:36:56,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, punch him in the face.

595
00:36:56,291 --> 00:37:01,054
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what else to tell you.

596
00:37:01,074 --> 00:37:03,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Has he ever actually played Microsoft or Nintendo products?

597
00:37:05,642 --> 00:37:08,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, he played Pictochow, my dear.

598
00:37:08,585 --> 00:37:09,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, that doesn't fucking count.

599
00:37:09,825 --> 00:37:11,547
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's not even like a game.

600
00:37:11,847 --> 00:37:17,351
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to sit that boy down and tell him, you know what, you need to try it, or you need to S-T-F-U.

601
00:37:18,692 --> 00:37:22,475
[SPEAKER_09]: And you tell him that three boobs on the radio said that to him.

602
00:37:23,495 --> 00:37:24,756
[SPEAKER_09]: There's another thing I want to rant about.

603
00:37:24,836 --> 00:37:25,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, hurry up.

604
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:27,719
[SPEAKER_09]: He's basically a neo-Nazi.

605
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:30,821
[SPEAKER_00]: Hide is my dog, hide is my dog, hide is my dog.

606
00:37:31,522 --> 00:37:32,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't that a Bloomchen song?

607
00:37:33,003 --> 00:37:33,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, forget it.

608
00:37:33,944 --> 00:37:36,526
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we gotta let you both go, buddy.

609
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:37,146
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good one.

610
00:37:37,646 --> 00:37:37,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

611
00:37:38,567 --> 00:37:39,788
[SPEAKER_09]: And kick that guy in the balls.

612
00:37:40,749 --> 00:37:42,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to one more call here.

613
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

614
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:44,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello?

615
00:37:44,992 --> 00:37:45,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

616
00:37:46,693 --> 00:37:47,313
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, hi there.

617
00:37:47,494 --> 00:37:48,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, who's this?

618
00:37:49,395 --> 00:37:49,795
[SPEAKER_11]: Funny Dale.

619
00:37:49,995 --> 00:37:50,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Funny Dale.

620
00:37:50,736 --> 00:37:51,276
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind?

621
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:56,460
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to talk about the issue you had a few minutes ago about the female gamers.

622
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,501
[SPEAKER_11]: By all means, go for it.

623
00:37:58,414 --> 00:38:14,711
[SPEAKER_11]: And the reason why you see these websites, the Frag Dolls and the PMS Clan all have these young supermodels is because, well, I hate to say this, but a good portion of the video game audience is a bunch of 15 year olds who, well, can't get laid.

624
00:38:16,313 --> 00:38:20,718
[SPEAKER_11]: And they shouldn't really be looking at porn, so the Frag Dolls are probably the closest thing.

625
00:38:22,069 --> 00:38:22,509
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

626
00:38:22,629 --> 00:38:23,790
[SPEAKER_09]: And I agree with that.

627
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:30,732
[SPEAKER_09]: I totally agree with what you're saying, Funnydale, because it's apparent in what's happening with G4 TV as well, right?

628
00:38:30,972 --> 00:38:37,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it was supposed to be like a network for games, and it kind of turned into it's just geared at the young 15-year-old males and stuff who can't get laid, right?

629
00:38:37,914 --> 00:38:38,374
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the same thing.

630
00:38:38,614 --> 00:38:50,378
[SPEAKER_09]: But here's the problem I see with that, is that if gaming truly wants to open its audience to everyone, as you see that Nintendo is trying to do very badly, and granted, Nintendo doesn't sponsor any of this stuff,

631
00:38:50,658 --> 00:38:52,379
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm talking about the gamer community as a whole.

632
00:38:53,159 --> 00:39:00,903
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to be looked at as something other than a bunch of 15-year-old kids who can't get laid, this shit has to stop.

633
00:39:02,243 --> 00:39:07,926
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what's really about, and I think that's why we're here kind of speaking out against it a little bit, is here to say, you know what?

634
00:39:08,649 --> 00:39:16,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Gamers come in all shapes, sizes, and types, and we like games, and we don't have to fit into these certain stereotypes.

635
00:39:16,214 --> 00:39:23,299
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just another sign of how stereotypes hurt society, and that goes in all facets of life.

636
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:31,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Why can't we go back to the wonderful flashback for me like 20 years ago, or maybe not even quite 20 years ago,

637
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:35,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go back to the time when gaming was real gaming.

638
00:39:35,894 --> 00:39:38,496
[SPEAKER_08]: We're talking the Nintendo World Championships.

639
00:39:38,656 --> 00:39:39,116
[SPEAKER_08]: God damn it.

640
00:39:39,396 --> 00:39:44,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Why can't we go back to simpler times where it was based on skill and not whether you're a man or a woman.

641
00:39:45,139 --> 00:39:48,781
[SPEAKER_08]: It's how well you're good at Super Mario Brothers, Rad Racer, and Tetris.

642
00:39:48,801 --> 00:39:50,202
[SPEAKER_09]: And when the Power Glove was so bad.

643
00:39:50,282 --> 00:39:52,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Kali, you were trying to get a point in there.

644
00:39:52,867 --> 00:40:00,434
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the problem with the argument is that game publishers are there to make money, and they make money doing that.

645
00:40:00,494 --> 00:40:01,494
[SPEAKER_11]: Just look at MTV.

646
00:40:02,535 --> 00:40:11,783
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good point, but also look at games like Tetris and Brain Training, and the PopCap games is another big one on the internet, PopCap.com.

647
00:40:12,103 --> 00:40:16,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Those games and those types of things really reach to such a broader audience.

648
00:40:17,128 --> 00:40:19,490
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the publishers have to be willing to take a risk once in a while.

649
00:40:20,177 --> 00:40:21,879
[SPEAKER_11]: Tetris is the exception

650
00:40:43,328 --> 00:40:46,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, as long as it makes the money, they'll keep on doing it.

651
00:40:46,371 --> 00:40:48,133
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's unfortunate, but it's true.

652
00:40:48,293 --> 00:40:48,654
[SPEAKER_09]: That's true.

653
00:40:48,694 --> 00:40:51,517
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's, you know, again, that's why I vote with my dollars.

654
00:40:51,857 --> 00:40:54,640
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a point that came up in Part A, you know, vote with my dollars.

655
00:40:54,660 --> 00:41:00,387
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to continue to support these games that are all about, you know, the TNA.

656
00:41:00,887 --> 00:41:03,290
[SPEAKER_09]: So, well, maybe Dead or Alive, though, because that game's kind of fun.

657
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:07,503
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

658
00:41:35,882 --> 00:41:37,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Spoiled Rotten Prisoners.

659
00:41:37,563 --> 00:41:41,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, seriously, it's really interesting.

660
00:41:42,364 --> 00:41:45,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Now when you go to prison, you actually might be able to play video games.

661
00:41:46,105 --> 00:41:46,446
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

662
00:41:46,746 --> 00:41:58,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Inmates in Oregon can purchase a plug-and-play console, kind of like a kiosk Nintendo, with 50 embedded games and are mounted to an LCD TV if they behave.

663
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:02,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Plus, I don't know, it's just,

664
00:42:03,138 --> 00:42:08,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Really interesting that they're actually coming out with video games from inmates.

665
00:42:08,642 --> 00:42:15,586
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, come on, they're in there for... Unless, unless they're playing really crappy games like, you know, E.T.

666
00:42:15,646 --> 00:42:16,326
[SPEAKER_08]: or something like that for the 2600.

667
00:42:18,038 --> 00:42:30,465
[SPEAKER_09]: What I thought was funniest about that article was that some stupid prison had allowed games like Grand Theft Auto and games where you're killing cops to actually be played until they realized what was actually in the game.

668
00:42:30,525 --> 00:42:34,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, I didn't realize there was cop killing in Cop Killer the game.

669
00:42:34,387 --> 00:42:35,688
[SPEAKER_09]: You're tax dollars at work.

670
00:42:37,049 --> 00:42:39,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this a good thing, a bad thing?

671
00:42:41,608 --> 00:42:42,389
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

672
00:43:06,527 --> 00:43:11,450
[SPEAKER_09]: The thing is that I hear that this comes out to sort of combat prison riots.

673
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:13,292
[SPEAKER_09]: It's to try and de-stress the prisoners.

674
00:43:13,652 --> 00:43:14,813
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm kind of like, you know what?

675
00:43:15,754 --> 00:43:18,015
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got to figure out a different way to break up prison riots.

676
00:43:18,396 --> 00:43:20,257
[SPEAKER_07]: We shoot them with a shotgun to the face.

677
00:43:20,357 --> 00:43:21,158
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, come on.

678
00:43:21,238 --> 00:43:22,159
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty simple.

679
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:24,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Now we're getting into pretty radical politics.

680
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,563
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, you've got to think of other ways to combat prison riots.

681
00:43:27,663 --> 00:43:29,624
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to be rioting if they don't have a face.

682
00:43:29,904 --> 00:43:31,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't let them out of their cell if they're going to riot.

683
00:43:33,894 --> 00:43:38,617
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the running man, because Richard Dawson was a villain, and that's awesome.

684
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:43,761
[SPEAKER_09]: One thing that's certainly villainous in its own way is spam on the internet.

685
00:43:43,781 --> 00:43:45,422
[SPEAKER_09]: You know you guys hate getting spam mail.

686
00:43:45,722 --> 00:43:46,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, guess what?

687
00:43:46,242 --> 00:43:54,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you can get spam on your Xbox 360, thanks to Burnout Revenge, who encourages you to send in-game clips to your friends.

688
00:43:55,289 --> 00:44:00,212
[SPEAKER_09]: And you even get achievement points when you do so, right, Loki, who spammed me last week with this?

689
00:44:00,831 --> 00:44:02,032
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

690
00:44:25,322 --> 00:44:29,787
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, I think you guys need to be a little smarter when you're thinking of your achievement points, scales like that.

691
00:44:29,827 --> 00:44:32,550
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not an achievement in gameplay.

692
00:44:32,891 --> 00:44:34,132
[SPEAKER_08]: That's an achievement in whoring.

693
00:44:34,452 --> 00:44:37,095
[SPEAKER_08]: And to be honest, the replays are kind of retarded anyways.

694
00:44:37,155 --> 00:44:43,823
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I've made some pretty cool ones, but nothing like, oh my god, you have to see this, except for the glitch that I saw, but I couldn't record that.

695
00:44:45,293 --> 00:44:45,573
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

696
00:44:46,414 --> 00:44:49,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, you got some hackin' and crackin' news, right, Loki?

697
00:44:50,436 --> 00:44:51,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course.

698
00:44:51,657 --> 00:44:58,141
[SPEAKER_08]: The first one, it's pretty major, actually, was that the Xbox 360 DVD firmware has been hacked.

699
00:44:58,241 --> 00:44:59,201
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a video of it.

700
00:44:59,562 --> 00:45:11,249
[SPEAKER_08]: And basically, the way it works is all Xbox 360 games that come out there, of course, they're all encoded so that you can't reverse engineer them and stuff.

701
00:45:11,309 --> 00:45:12,730
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's something.

702
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:14,551
[SPEAKER_08]: And plus, each single...

703
00:45:16,574 --> 00:45:20,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Their file type, XEX, has a media flag.

704
00:45:20,755 --> 00:45:25,256
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, the media flag tells the Xbox what type of media it's on.

705
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:29,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Whether that be a CD-R, DVD-R, DVD Plus R, etc.

706
00:45:29,957 --> 00:45:32,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Or DVD, Xbox, DVD, Xbox 360.

707
00:45:33,438 --> 00:45:35,199
[SPEAKER_08]: So it knows what type of media it's on.

708
00:45:35,539 --> 00:45:43,261
[SPEAKER_08]: So if, for example, I try to copy a game and I make a perfect copy and it's on a DVD-R, it's going to say, hey, this isn't a pressed CD.

709
00:45:44,261 --> 00:45:44,781
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not playing it.

710
00:45:46,044 --> 00:45:50,705
[SPEAKER_08]: So what they did was they actually modified the DVD firmware not to make that check.

711
00:45:50,965 --> 00:45:54,506
[SPEAKER_08]: So if I make an exact copy of the game, it'll run like nothing.

712
00:45:55,426 --> 00:46:05,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, as with all these exploits, the hacking group behind it is not releasing the firmware because they don't endorse piracy, they only endorse hacking.

713
00:46:05,548 --> 00:46:07,989
[SPEAKER_08]: So, okay.

714
00:46:08,469 --> 00:46:12,150
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, it's not going to be released, but it can be done.

715
00:46:13,339 --> 00:46:17,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's somebody else off to figure it out, I suppose, who doesn't endorse piracy, if that's what you're into.

716
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:19,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly, and here's my thing.

717
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:23,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I remember back in the heyday, when I used to import games, I used to get HK copies.

718
00:46:24,401 --> 00:46:28,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, these were mass-produced, pirated copies where they would be pressed.

719
00:46:30,043 --> 00:46:31,763
[SPEAKER_08]: Why aren't these floating around out there?

720
00:46:32,483 --> 00:46:39,805
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, because if you can press an exact copy of the game, and it's on a DVD, I mean, shouldn't it work?

721
00:46:40,625 --> 00:46:40,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe?

722
00:46:40,885 --> 00:46:41,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

723
00:46:41,744 --> 00:46:42,184
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

724
00:46:42,845 --> 00:46:43,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a thought.

725
00:46:43,685 --> 00:46:44,185
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyways.

726
00:46:46,306 --> 00:46:49,628
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course some other cool stuff of course on the PSP.

727
00:46:49,688 --> 00:46:53,290
[SPEAKER_08]: The first one is this really strange stick minigame.

728
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:56,171
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like with stick figures called Pointless Tormenting.

729
00:46:57,372 --> 00:46:58,492
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it already.

730
00:46:59,913 --> 00:47:02,454
[SPEAKER_08]: It's basically you torment stick figures.

731
00:47:03,775 --> 00:47:04,675
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just really simple.

732
00:47:04,975 --> 00:47:05,716
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of stupid.

733
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:07,316
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you're interested in it.

734
00:47:07,456 --> 00:47:08,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember Stick Fighter?

735
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:10,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Dick Fighter was kind of fun.

736
00:47:10,246 --> 00:47:11,267
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I wanted to say.

737
00:47:12,807 --> 00:47:15,889
[SPEAKER_08]: It's on PSP updates, so you can check that out.

738
00:47:16,009 --> 00:47:16,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty sweet.

739
00:47:17,009 --> 00:47:23,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Another kind of cool game is another homebrew game that's been, I think even on the Dreamcast, called Dragon Fighter.

740
00:47:24,072 --> 00:47:28,654
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of like a Final Fantasy fighting game, almost.

741
00:47:28,714 --> 00:47:31,395
[SPEAKER_08]: It has the really super deformed characters and stuff.

742
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:36,197
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, Dragon Fighter version 0.2 was released on the PSP, so you can check it out.

743
00:47:36,756 --> 00:47:41,499
[SPEAKER_08]: I think actually some of the graphics were used from RPG Maker is what they based a lot of this on.

744
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:42,860
[SPEAKER_08]: So check it out.

745
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:43,841
[SPEAKER_08]: It might be something interesting.

746
00:47:43,881 --> 00:47:44,581
[SPEAKER_08]: It's free.

747
00:47:45,062 --> 00:47:46,763
[SPEAKER_08]: It's on PSP Updates as well.

748
00:47:46,903 --> 00:47:53,508
[SPEAKER_08]: Another one that I did find that was kind of neat was this game called Irkwan Masters.

749
00:47:54,108 --> 00:48:00,172
[SPEAKER_08]: And now if you remember way back in the day in DOS games, there was this game called Star Control, which is pretty sweet.

750
00:48:00,232 --> 00:48:05,636
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like a kind of a space shooter RPG type of thing.

751
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this is based on that.

752
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:11,922
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's also based on another knockoff game called, of course, Irkon Masters.

753
00:48:11,982 --> 00:48:12,622
[SPEAKER_08]: But check it out.

754
00:48:13,282 --> 00:48:16,363
[SPEAKER_08]: They have version 0.50 available.

755
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:17,523
[SPEAKER_08]: And it looks pretty sweet.

756
00:48:17,763 --> 00:48:22,364
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's anything like Star Control or Star Control 2 was, really fun shooter game.

757
00:48:22,404 --> 00:48:23,985
[SPEAKER_08]: So check it out.

758
00:48:24,545 --> 00:48:24,885
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

759
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:30,303
[SPEAKER_09]: We're now going to go ahead and let DarkSakura dive in and open up our mailbag.

760
00:48:30,343 --> 00:48:39,489
[SPEAKER_09]: When you guys send us letters to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, DarkSakura likes to dig through the mailbag and pick out a few favorites to make fun of here live on air.

761
00:48:39,909 --> 00:48:40,569
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm good at that.

762
00:48:40,649 --> 00:48:41,350
[SPEAKER_09]: No, just kidding.

763
00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:45,752
[SPEAKER_09]: She's going to give some serious responses with our help here to this week's letters.

764
00:48:45,953 --> 00:48:47,113
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's open up the mailbag.

765
00:48:47,694 --> 00:48:48,994
[SPEAKER_09]: Who sent us some mail this week?

766
00:48:51,296 --> 00:48:54,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Sipspon wrote in and said...

767
00:48:55,373 --> 00:48:57,314
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got another suggestion for the show.

768
00:48:57,434 --> 00:49:00,836
[SPEAKER_03]: How about making a question for the listener call-in section?

769
00:49:01,337 --> 00:49:05,119
[SPEAKER_03]: As it seems to me now, the call-in part is really people just doing a shout-out or whatever.

770
00:49:05,179 --> 00:49:06,800
[SPEAKER_03]: There doesn't seem to be any real structure.

771
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:12,183
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were to pose a question early in the show, listeners would have time to think about answers and could call in and discuss.

772
00:49:13,001 --> 00:49:17,143
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's okay to have random calls and shoutouts, but it's not very interesting unless you have something to say.

773
00:49:17,203 --> 00:49:17,683
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?

774
00:49:19,964 --> 00:49:25,147
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's a good idea, but I think I see a lot of other podcasts that kind of do that.

775
00:49:25,727 --> 00:49:29,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I don't see a whole lot that are interactive in that way.

776
00:49:29,649 --> 00:49:31,610
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of them do it through email and things like that.

777
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:37,432
[SPEAKER_09]: And I kind of always, at least my envision of the show, is that things be like an open format.

778
00:49:37,472 --> 00:49:41,114
[SPEAKER_09]: And if somebody had a topic they wanted to bring to us, they could do that on the Skype line.

779
00:49:41,274 --> 00:49:43,216
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

780
00:50:11,667 --> 00:50:12,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Call Echo 123 so we don't hear this.

781
00:50:12,507 --> 00:50:12,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi!

782
00:50:27,714 --> 00:50:29,035
[SPEAKER_03]: We keep one in the closet.

783
00:50:53,496 --> 00:50:54,197
[SPEAKER_03]: WTF WTF WTF WTF

784
00:51:14,144 --> 00:51:15,084
[SPEAKER_08]: but it's a cool game.

785
00:51:15,424 --> 00:51:16,585
[SPEAKER_08]: It really is a cool game.

786
00:51:16,885 --> 00:51:18,085
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know what?

787
00:51:18,105 --> 00:51:19,065
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a different art style.

788
00:51:19,106 --> 00:51:21,546
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like people going, what the hell happened to Link?

789
00:51:21,926 --> 00:51:24,307
[SPEAKER_08]: He looks all cel-shaded and funky looking.

790
00:51:25,187 --> 00:51:26,008
[SPEAKER_08]: It's still a good game.

791
00:51:27,048 --> 00:51:40,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, except for the fact that the world was flooded and then when you go to one spoiler part of this game when you see Hyrule's underwater, you're like, why couldn't it have been that game?

792
00:51:40,372 --> 00:51:43,393
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, where Hyrule's not underwater, but whatever.

793
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:43,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, well.

794
00:51:45,431 --> 00:51:46,072
[SPEAKER_08]: And more emails?

795
00:51:47,253 --> 00:51:47,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, yes.

796
00:51:48,134 --> 00:51:49,635
[SPEAKER_03]: There is an email from Lauren.

797
00:51:49,655 --> 00:51:53,559
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, hey, I'm looking at full metal DDR pads on eBay.

798
00:51:53,639 --> 00:52:01,026
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like you can buy one for between $100 to $500 plus, but I was wondering if you knew which manufacturers are the more dependable, Blade, Ion, etc.

799
00:52:02,407 --> 00:52:06,271
[SPEAKER_03]: One of these ones is, I think it's the one that they were selling at Fry's.

800
00:52:08,127 --> 00:52:09,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I've seen that pad before there.

801
00:52:10,008 --> 00:52:11,168
[SPEAKER_03]: It was broken when I used it.

802
00:52:11,208 --> 00:52:11,708
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the thing.

803
00:52:11,808 --> 00:52:13,009
[SPEAKER_09]: There's the problem with it right there.

804
00:52:13,049 --> 00:52:14,970
[SPEAKER_09]: You see how it says, what is this one we're looking at here?

805
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:16,350
[SPEAKER_09]: The eBay one?

806
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:17,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Who makes this one?

807
00:52:17,571 --> 00:52:19,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Gus, I can't find the manufacturer.

808
00:52:19,051 --> 00:52:20,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me put it this way.

809
00:52:20,132 --> 00:52:22,272
[SPEAKER_08]: I've bought a metal eBay pad.

810
00:52:22,292 --> 00:52:25,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, the ones that are like an inch thick or something.

811
00:52:26,554 --> 00:52:27,754
[SPEAKER_08]: And that sucker bent.

812
00:52:29,295 --> 00:52:30,976
[SPEAKER_03]: The one that I was at E3, my...

813
00:52:32,648 --> 00:52:33,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Iguana Girl got injured on.

814
00:52:56,737 --> 00:53:00,181
[SPEAKER_09]: You know Guitar Hero is pretty rockin' and they do make some solid controllers.

815
00:53:00,981 --> 00:53:03,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, the Afterburner is the place to be for that.

816
00:53:04,144 --> 00:53:06,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Their stuff has always been high quality.

817
00:53:06,206 --> 00:53:06,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

818
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:09,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Except for one particular game.

819
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:12,993
[SPEAKER_09]: In my opinion, but other people feel differently, so that's just my opinion.

820
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:14,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Or build your own.

821
00:53:15,936 --> 00:53:19,559
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have the last two emails are from our friend Rob.

822
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:20,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Rockin'.

823
00:53:21,817 --> 00:53:27,801
[SPEAKER_03]: To read this, a friend asked me to advise on streaming HDTV to his TV from his PC, so I looked it up.

824
00:53:27,881 --> 00:53:36,847
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go to a Windows MCE route, there are two Microsoft devices they recommend, the Xbox 360 and Windows Media Extender.

825
00:53:37,387 --> 00:53:44,152
[SPEAKER_03]: On the Microsoft page for MCE, Windows Media Extender is downplayed almost completely in favor of the Xbox 360.

826
00:53:44,552 --> 00:53:46,213
[SPEAKER_03]: They really want to push those boxes.

827
00:53:47,994 --> 00:53:48,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting point.

828
00:53:48,875 --> 00:53:49,095
[SPEAKER_10]: Mm-hmm.

829
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:54,413
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other thing is actually a link from, I guess it's Gamasutra.

830
00:53:56,194 --> 00:54:03,178
[SPEAKER_03]: There is an article here about ESA files to retrieve Illinois bill game legal costs.

831
00:54:03,559 --> 00:54:08,782
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, yes, the legal, you know, I've got to admit, I've been trying to stay on what's going on with the bill.

832
00:54:09,262 --> 00:54:13,004
[SPEAKER_09]: The Game Industry Trade Association with the Entertainment Software Association has filed a petition to the United States Department

833
00:54:32,555 --> 00:54:40,466
[SPEAKER_03]: District Court asking it to order the state of Illinois to pay $644,545 in legal fees for its unsuccessful efforts to enact a law banning the sale of violent video games in the state.

834
00:54:47,773 --> 00:54:48,053
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

835
00:55:16,801 --> 00:55:17,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

836
00:55:17,483 --> 00:55:18,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Pay them up, Illinois.

837
00:55:18,989 --> 00:55:19,390
[SPEAKER_03]: You heard me.

838
00:55:20,414 --> 00:55:24,856
[SPEAKER_09]: If you've got some emails you want to send along, mailbag at orangeloungeradar.com is the place to do it.

839
00:55:24,916 --> 00:55:25,977
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all one word, mailbag.

840
00:55:26,597 --> 00:55:28,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on to some more news.

841
00:55:28,298 --> 00:55:32,219
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, you know I couldn't get through a show without bringing up something related to Final Fantasy XI.

842
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:40,243
[SPEAKER_09]: There's new information coming out about Treasures of Ott, Oregon, thanks to the event that happened recently there.

843
00:55:41,023 --> 00:55:43,124
[SPEAKER_09]: What was that in, I want to say Santa Cruz?

844
00:55:43,144 --> 00:55:44,204
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it was somewhere in California.

845
00:55:44,244 --> 00:55:45,865
[SPEAKER_09]: They had this big event, a live event.

846
00:55:45,905 --> 00:55:48,086
[SPEAKER_09]: They showed the new trailer and everybody was cheering.

847
00:55:48,464 --> 00:55:50,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's some new information on what's coming with the game.

848
00:55:50,445 --> 00:55:54,027
[SPEAKER_09]: And this sounds like it's going to be a much more thorough expansion than Chains of Promethea was.

849
00:55:54,287 --> 00:55:56,929
[SPEAKER_09]: Chains of Promethea was like, new missions, new areas.

850
00:55:57,089 --> 00:55:57,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Woo!

851
00:55:57,929 --> 00:55:59,910
[SPEAKER_09]: But this is a whole lot of new stuff.

852
00:56:00,371 --> 00:56:01,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Besieged mode.

853
00:56:01,471 --> 00:56:04,453
[SPEAKER_09]: This is where the enemies are going to start taking over the towns.

854
00:56:04,933 --> 00:56:07,215
[SPEAKER_09]: and you actually fight to keep over the town.

855
00:56:07,255 --> 00:56:07,976
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's kind of neat.

856
00:56:08,456 --> 00:56:10,198
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also going to be an assault mode.

857
00:56:10,919 --> 00:56:17,244
[SPEAKER_09]: This is where if you're over level 50, you can just play for an hour or so and you don't have to assemble a giant party.

858
00:56:17,264 --> 00:56:19,266
[SPEAKER_09]: You just go to take a huge quest.

859
00:56:19,546 --> 00:56:21,048
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a direct response to...

860
00:56:21,608 --> 00:56:23,830
[SPEAKER_09]: It takes me too long to find a flippin' party.

861
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:27,753
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to do something casually that doesn't take me all night long.

862
00:56:28,073 --> 00:56:36,119
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that's a good idea, except for the fact that it's limited to over level 50, because that kind of defeats the purpose in many ways, because it takes a while to get to level 50.

863
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:40,742
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not even going to talk about breaking the 50 cap and how hard that is.

864
00:56:40,962 --> 00:56:45,623
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll wait and see how that turns out before we make our final decisions on that.

865
00:56:46,543 --> 00:56:49,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, we do know that there's going to be a brand new job class.

866
00:56:49,744 --> 00:56:58,346
[SPEAKER_09]: The Puppet Master is going to be a new job class along with the previously announced Corsair, who you might as well call a pirate, and Blue Mage that were previously announced.

867
00:56:59,367 --> 00:57:00,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Puppet Master?

868
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:01,140
[SPEAKER_09]: I think so.

869
00:57:01,361 --> 00:57:03,302
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember if it was Puppeteer or Puppet Master.

870
00:57:03,322 --> 00:57:03,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Puppet Master.

871
00:57:04,023 --> 00:57:04,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it Puppet Master?

872
00:57:04,863 --> 00:57:08,706
[SPEAKER_03]: That just now has me thinking of a person with little creepy puppets going around.

873
00:57:08,866 --> 00:57:09,967
[SPEAKER_09]: That's actually what it is.

874
00:57:10,027 --> 00:57:10,628
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what it is.

875
00:57:10,648 --> 00:57:11,248
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

876
00:57:11,308 --> 00:57:11,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

877
00:57:12,009 --> 00:57:16,172
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my, whoa, we got DarkSakura to say something complimentary about Final Fantasy XI.

878
00:57:16,212 --> 00:57:17,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Someone note the date and time.

879
00:57:17,293 --> 00:57:17,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop pointing at me.

880
00:57:18,154 --> 00:57:19,334
[SPEAKER_03]: You're scary.

881
00:57:19,354 --> 00:57:20,055
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

882
00:57:20,115 --> 00:57:23,157
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had village raids for years in Ragnarok Online.

883
00:57:23,177 --> 00:57:25,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but that's just the GMs playing tricks on you.

884
00:57:27,634 --> 00:57:29,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, also, this is very cool as well.

885
00:57:30,716 --> 00:57:36,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Chocobo racing is going to be incorporated into Final Fantasy XI along with breeding.

886
00:57:36,518 --> 00:57:42,781
[SPEAKER_09]: So those of you guys that love to raise your own Chocobos in Final Fantasy VII, now it's going to be incorporated into Final Fantasy XI.

887
00:57:43,201 --> 00:57:44,082
[SPEAKER_09]: That is pretty cool.

888
00:57:44,122 --> 00:57:45,062
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got to say my hat's off to them.

889
00:57:45,082 --> 00:57:46,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you get a black one?

890
00:57:46,123 --> 00:57:46,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you get a gold one?

891
00:57:47,043 --> 00:57:47,703
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no idea.

892
00:57:47,803 --> 00:57:48,744
[SPEAKER_09]: We won't know until it comes out.

893
00:57:48,764 --> 00:57:50,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have to race them at the gold saucer?

894
00:57:50,885 --> 00:57:51,185
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

895
00:57:51,943 --> 00:57:52,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Colosseum

896
00:58:14,195 --> 00:58:15,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't really know what it's going to be yet.

897
00:58:16,176 --> 00:58:18,238
[SPEAKER_09]: They just said a Colosseum.

898
00:58:18,558 --> 00:58:29,565
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they have PvP and Ballista, so we don't know if it's going to be PvP or if it's going to be like, think about Final Fantasy VI had a Colosseum, and you would kind of bet an item, and then depending on if you won, you would get something better.

899
00:58:29,885 --> 00:58:30,425
[SPEAKER_09]: So who knows?

900
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:31,586
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be a variety of things.

901
00:58:32,046 --> 00:58:33,067
[SPEAKER_09]: So we shall see.

902
00:58:33,367 --> 00:58:34,187
[SPEAKER_09]: So pretty exciting.

903
00:58:34,227 --> 00:58:36,388
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is an addition to new areas and stuff.

904
00:58:36,428 --> 00:58:45,112
[SPEAKER_09]: So it sounds like Final Fantasy XI is learning from the poor reviews of Chains of Promethea and kind of adding a lot more oomph into this expansion.

905
00:58:45,152 --> 00:58:46,552
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to get some people back into the game.

906
00:58:47,152 --> 00:58:47,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Here I come.

907
00:58:49,013 --> 00:58:49,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Enough said.

908
00:58:49,814 --> 00:58:52,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's not the only thing Square's working on, though, right?

909
00:58:52,175 --> 00:58:53,375
[SPEAKER_09]: I should say Squeenix.

910
00:58:53,575 --> 00:58:55,556
[SPEAKER_08]: They're working on another MMO.

911
00:58:57,213 --> 00:58:58,434
[SPEAKER_08]: What's this?

912
00:58:58,494 --> 00:58:59,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's just a brand new MMO.

913
00:58:59,874 --> 00:59:03,636
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not going to be Final Fantasy related.

914
00:59:03,656 --> 00:59:05,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Dragon Quest Online.

915
00:59:06,157 --> 00:59:09,318
[SPEAKER_08]: But other details beyond that, nothing.

916
00:59:09,799 --> 00:59:12,300
[SPEAKER_08]: They just know that they're working on it.

917
00:59:14,244 --> 00:59:15,424
[SPEAKER_08]: So Final Fantasy XIII?

918
00:59:15,905 --> 00:59:16,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably not.

919
00:59:16,885 --> 00:59:18,025
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be Final Fantasy.

920
00:59:18,045 --> 00:59:18,586
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be something else.

921
00:59:18,826 --> 00:59:19,866
[SPEAKER_08]: I did remember hearing them.

922
00:59:20,466 --> 00:59:23,287
[SPEAKER_08]: They were working on another game, and I do remember seeing something about this.

923
00:59:23,628 --> 00:59:24,688
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't Final Fantasy.

924
00:59:24,808 --> 00:59:26,168
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't remember what it was, though.

925
00:59:26,589 --> 00:59:27,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Something that was at E3 last year.

926
00:59:27,909 --> 00:59:30,430
[SPEAKER_09]: I seem to remember vaguely hearing something about this, too.

927
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:32,831
[SPEAKER_09]: So I wonder if this is related or if it's something completely different.

928
00:59:33,771 --> 00:59:34,091
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

929
00:59:34,512 --> 00:59:36,232
[SPEAKER_09]: But, yeah.

930
00:59:36,712 --> 00:59:37,193
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

931
00:59:38,033 --> 00:59:38,293
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

932
00:59:40,411 --> 00:59:41,434
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to move on here.

933
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:49,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I know that I don't get a Website of the Week segment here on this show, but let's pretend for once that I did get a Website of the Week segment.

934
00:59:52,031 --> 00:59:52,752
[SPEAKER_09]: You're just jealous.

935
00:59:52,852 --> 00:59:53,052
[SPEAKER_09]: Scandal.

936
01:00:13,638 --> 01:00:21,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Take a stand against politicians who come up with these harebrained bills about preventing the violent video games.

937
01:00:21,804 --> 01:00:24,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Once in a while, depending on the wording of the bill, it can be okay.

938
01:00:24,406 --> 01:00:29,530
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm talking about the cases where they compare the games to pornography and all that stuff.

939
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:32,671
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, I've been saying throughout the past couple shows, vote with your dollars.

940
01:00:32,691 --> 01:00:34,311
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, now here you can vote with your votes.

941
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:43,334
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's basically a place to get people mobilized for action in the political world in the name of gaming.

942
01:00:43,354 --> 01:00:44,234
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's great.

943
01:00:44,754 --> 01:00:47,775
[SPEAKER_09]: And here's a little quote from the website about what they're all about there.

944
01:00:48,275 --> 01:00:49,376
[SPEAKER_09]: Video Game Voters Network

945
01:01:14,973 --> 01:01:15,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Protect Your Games.

946
01:01:15,834 --> 01:01:18,295
[SPEAKER_09]: That's www.videogamevoters.org.

947
01:01:18,755 --> 01:01:20,816
[SPEAKER_09]: I urge you to sign up for this site.

948
01:01:21,597 --> 01:01:28,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if you don't agree with all of it, maybe you'll find that once you've read it, you don't agree with everything maybe that they're going to do, at least you're educated.

949
01:01:29,541 --> 01:01:30,781
[SPEAKER_09]: And knowing is half the battle, right?

950
01:01:31,422 --> 01:01:31,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Yo, Joe.

951
01:01:32,307 --> 01:01:34,248
[SPEAKER_09]: So bravo to those guys for starting that up.

952
01:01:34,268 --> 01:01:39,391
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a good idea to get everybody together to take action against this stuff and speak up and say, you know what?

953
01:01:39,891 --> 01:01:42,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Gamers aren't a bunch of 15-year-old guys who can't get laid.

954
01:01:42,773 --> 01:01:56,760
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of gamers over 18 who are voting you guys in office, and if you're going to continue to be ignorant about gaming, which is what a lot of this stuff ends up being, is ignorance about gaming, then we're going to remove you from office and put someone in there who's not as ignorant.

955
01:01:57,881 --> 01:01:58,321
[SPEAKER_09]: Good idea.

956
01:01:59,597 --> 01:02:01,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Any last minute stories anyone wants to share?

957
01:02:01,438 --> 01:02:02,399
[SPEAKER_09]: But of course!

958
01:02:02,519 --> 01:02:03,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, what's up?

959
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:23,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of on the same level as Half-Life 2, Survivor for the arcade, Global VR, developer of arcade machines, has announced a new title for conversion to the arcade play, and that would be Ubisoft's Far Cry Instincts, the console version for the Far Cry series.

960
01:02:24,631 --> 01:02:28,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Crisis is coming to the arcade.

961
01:02:28,809 --> 01:02:29,509
[SPEAKER_08]: I have one for you, Rob.

962
01:02:29,549 --> 01:02:29,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

963
01:02:29,649 --> 01:02:31,370
[SPEAKER_08]: About Sid Meier.

964
01:02:31,390 --> 01:02:31,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.

965
01:02:51,269 --> 01:02:58,594
[SPEAKER_03]: A new PC game that will allow you to build your very own rail network laying tracks and deciding routes and designing trains called Railroads!

966
01:02:58,774 --> 01:02:59,555
[SPEAKER_03]: With an exclamation point.

967
01:02:59,635 --> 01:03:00,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, but there was Railroad Tycoon.

968
01:03:02,277 --> 01:03:03,617
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't Sid Meier's Railroad.

969
01:03:03,637 --> 01:03:04,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, fine.

970
01:03:04,178 --> 01:03:04,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so fine.

971
01:03:04,878 --> 01:03:05,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Railroads.

972
01:03:05,479 --> 01:03:07,200
[SPEAKER_03]: It's titled Sid Meier's Railroads.

973
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:07,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

974
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:11,543
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a click and drag system to lay tracks, bridges, tunnels, blah blah blah.

975
01:03:12,568 --> 01:03:21,292
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also, not only as your rail network grows, cities, industries, you organize cargo transport, provide passenger routes for commuters.

976
01:03:21,532 --> 01:03:22,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Fend off hobos.

977
01:03:22,833 --> 01:03:23,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop it.

978
01:03:25,334 --> 01:03:31,097
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll need to basically watch the business side as you are also dealing with the technical side.

979
01:03:31,157 --> 01:03:32,397
[SPEAKER_09]: You know who will like this game a lot?

980
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:32,897
[SPEAKER_09]: My dad.

981
01:03:33,057 --> 01:03:34,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Because he used to work for the railroad.

982
01:03:34,278 --> 01:03:36,899
[SPEAKER_09]: He's retired now, but he worked for the railroad, so he loves these types of things.

983
01:03:37,279 --> 01:03:38,540
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll share this with him.

984
01:03:38,871 --> 01:03:45,977
[SPEAKER_03]: You also have the ability to make your own maps and scenarios and do your dream layout in train table mode.

985
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:51,442
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can also challenge historical figures like Cornelius Vanderbilt and J.P.

986
01:03:51,482 --> 01:03:51,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Morgan.

987
01:03:53,384 --> 01:03:57,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, that's kind of interesting because it's like the civilization aspect there in railroading.

988
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:57,928
[SPEAKER_09]: That's cool.

989
01:03:57,948 --> 01:04:02,091
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has LAN or online play, competitive, cooperative.

990
01:04:03,312 --> 01:04:04,874
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's going to be pretty big.

991
01:04:06,519 --> 01:04:21,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Railroad Tycoon is one of those great classic games that you should definitely check out if you're kind of younger or into gaming or whatever and haven't checked out a lot of old PC gaming titles that are just fabulous.

992
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:23,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Civilization, definitely check that out.

993
01:04:24,498 --> 01:04:26,119
[SPEAKER_09]: and Railroad Tycoon is great.

994
01:04:26,159 --> 01:04:27,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, this game looks very pretty.

995
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,461
[SPEAKER_09]: That's cool.

996
01:04:28,521 --> 01:04:30,363
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope it's easy to get into though.

997
01:04:30,383 --> 01:04:34,626
[SPEAKER_09]: The problem with a lot of these PC sim type of games is that the learning curve is way too high.

998
01:04:34,987 --> 01:04:37,349
[SPEAKER_09]: But hopefully this will be easy to get into.

999
01:04:37,409 --> 01:04:40,952
[SPEAKER_09]: And Civilization, at least the original one, had a pretty good learning curve on it.

1000
01:04:41,012 --> 01:04:43,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Civ 2 and 3 were pretty good too.

1001
01:04:43,274 --> 01:04:44,735
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have faith that this will be good.

1002
01:04:45,056 --> 01:04:46,437
[SPEAKER_03]: It's looking pretty awesome so far.

1003
01:04:46,457 --> 01:04:49,940
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I probably wouldn't be too into playing it, but it looks pretty cool.

1004
01:04:50,527 --> 01:04:50,807
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100 Matt

1005
01:05:11,986 --> 01:05:12,786
[SPEAKER_08]: One of them is

1006
01:05:30,566 --> 01:05:38,552
[SPEAKER_08]: This 15 year old student from Salem, Virginia recited 8,784 digits of pi from memory on Tuesday.

1007
01:05:39,012 --> 01:05:44,536
[SPEAKER_08]: His father promised to buy him an Xbox 360 if he succeeded his own personal goal, which was 10,790.

1008
01:05:44,876 --> 01:05:51,421
[SPEAKER_08]: He was actually trying to set the world record, which was...

1009
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:53,588
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1010
01:06:18,772 --> 01:06:20,934
[SPEAKER_09]: So he can't even download something off Xbox Live Arcade.

1011
01:06:20,974 --> 01:06:22,315
[SPEAKER_09]: He just gets a core.

1012
01:06:22,375 --> 01:06:27,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Ironically enough, $10,790 is how many systems that were actually sold in Japan.

1013
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:28,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop it.

1014
01:06:30,422 --> 01:06:31,183
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what, though?

1015
01:06:31,463 --> 01:06:38,369
[SPEAKER_09]: In the time it took him to learn to memorize that, the kid could have gone out and gotten a job and gotten the money to buy this Xbox 360, don't you think?

1016
01:06:38,830 --> 01:06:39,230
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess it was.

1017
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:39,751
[SPEAKER_09]: He's 15.

1018
01:06:39,791 --> 01:06:40,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe he can't work.

1019
01:06:40,812 --> 01:06:42,613
[SPEAKER_09]: You can get a work permit at that age, can't you?

1020
01:06:43,494 --> 01:06:44,735
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell yeah.

1021
01:06:45,015 --> 01:06:45,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Get a job!

1022
01:06:47,093 --> 01:06:47,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Foname

1023
01:07:10,894 --> 01:07:17,759
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura will bake some pies since after all the emails do say you should be in the kitchen, right?

1024
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,662
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll bake arsenic pie.

1025
01:07:39,289 --> 01:07:40,392
[SPEAKER_08]: I might go down for a day.

1026
01:07:45,987 --> 01:07:47,708
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to about wrap it up for tonight's program.

1027
01:07:47,848 --> 01:07:48,749
[SPEAKER_02]: And ribbons and bows.

1028
01:07:48,989 --> 01:07:53,051
[SPEAKER_09]: A few quick programming notes for you guys, for those of you guys that listen to Orange Lounge Radio 24-7.

1029
01:07:53,091 --> 01:07:57,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Just so you know, Pump Up the Volume will not be heard this week.

1030
01:07:57,634 --> 01:07:58,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of Comcast.

1031
01:07:59,075 --> 01:07:59,535
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

1032
01:07:59,756 --> 01:08:03,078
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I did get The Ultimate Geek as my tech, and he was awesome.

1033
01:08:03,518 --> 01:08:03,918
[SPEAKER_09]: That's cool.

1034
01:08:03,978 --> 01:08:06,219
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the guy who came to... He might be listening to the show tonight.

1035
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:06,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows?

1036
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:13,024
[SPEAKER_03]: He actually did... Well, I wouldn't say he's like a geek geek, but he's into the same type of... He likes Monty Python and... That's cool.

1037
01:08:13,384 --> 01:08:14,425
[SPEAKER_03]: And George Romero.

1038
01:08:14,545 --> 01:08:14,685
Yeah.

1039
01:08:16,131 --> 01:08:17,031
[SPEAKER_03]: He was really awesome.

1040
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:23,536
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were listening, I totally forgot what your name was because I actually do want to send a compliment to your boss.

1041
01:08:24,097 --> 01:08:27,699
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you are listening, email me at jamie at orangedownsradio.com.

1042
01:08:27,779 --> 01:08:30,161
[SPEAKER_03]: I will totally write a letter of commendation to your boss.

1043
01:08:30,381 --> 01:08:32,683
[SPEAKER_09]: But also, he needs to fix your line.

1044
01:08:33,003 --> 01:08:33,584
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not him.

1045
01:08:33,664 --> 01:08:34,344
[SPEAKER_03]: We found out what it is.

1046
01:08:35,345 --> 01:08:39,148
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, the tech who came over, the first thing he did was go in and pet Shermie.

1047
01:08:40,073 --> 01:08:40,954
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, you're cool.

1048
01:08:41,574 --> 01:08:44,676
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had nothing but good from Comcast lately, even though my service hasn't been great.

1049
01:08:44,776 --> 01:08:53,120
[SPEAKER_09]: When Loki and I lived together, we had a tech come over to the place that we were living at, and the guy walked into the room and saw the arcade machine that Loki had built, and was like, what do you guys do here?

1050
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:54,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, I still get stuff.

1051
01:08:54,801 --> 01:09:01,165
[SPEAKER_08]: I get, you know, people, like, I order pizza, and he's like, didn't you used to live on, yeah.

1052
01:09:01,325 --> 01:09:03,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they recognize the arcade cabinet, and

1053
01:09:04,907 --> 01:09:06,608
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember when you guys were building that.

1054
01:09:07,929 --> 01:09:09,349
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.

1055
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:19,035
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would like to say, what happened is that in my neighborhood, someone cut the head line of a fiber optic cable, cost them $10,000 to repair it.

1056
01:09:19,055 --> 01:09:19,715
[SPEAKER_02]: What a bunch of jerks.

1057
01:09:20,195 --> 01:09:27,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and so we were all out of service, and what's happening is that while they're effecting the repairs and putting everything back together, we've been having really erratic service.

1058
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:38,148
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I've been told to give it a week for it to clear up, so as a result, so that you guys don't have to put up with the crap that happened last week, I am not doing a show this Tuesday, I will be back the next week.

1059
01:09:38,308 --> 01:09:45,033
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, but I will be on Wednesday night with the Rob Roberts show, so for some music and some geek chat and stuff, and, uh, you know, uh, whatever else...

1060
01:09:45,979 --> 01:09:46,439
[SPEAKER_09]: comes up.

1061
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:48,280
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll let you know about it on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1062
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:51,782
[SPEAKER_09]: For now, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts, starting off with Loki.

1063
01:09:53,323 --> 01:09:53,803
[SPEAKER_08]: My bad.

1064
01:09:53,903 --> 01:09:57,325
[SPEAKER_08]: I completely forgot something I wanted to talk about, and I'll make it really quick.

1065
01:09:57,345 --> 01:09:57,945
[SPEAKER_08]: Make it quick.

1066
01:09:58,445 --> 01:09:59,406
[SPEAKER_08]: We have to talk about this.

1067
01:09:59,466 --> 01:10:00,646
[SPEAKER_08]: DDR Supernova.

1068
01:10:00,746 --> 01:10:04,908
[SPEAKER_08]: It was at the ASI event that was going on, and there was some new stuff.

1069
01:10:05,949 --> 01:10:11,451
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing, of course, Betson, the manufacturer of this, said no upgrade units will be available.

1070
01:10:11,531 --> 01:10:12,712
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all new hardware.

1071
01:10:12,732 --> 01:10:14,113
[SPEAKER_08]: You can buy it straight, you know.

1072
01:10:15,317 --> 01:10:23,880
[SPEAKER_08]: They did show videos that were recorded at the event of the new songs, including Healing Division and also Chaos.

1073
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:30,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Chaos, which has four goddamn billion tempo changes and stops in it, including 164th stops, so it's

1074
01:10:33,598 --> 01:10:34,719
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, your final thought?

1075
01:11:03,063 --> 01:11:07,026
[SPEAKER_03]: I have very conflicting emotions toward Comcast right now.

1076
01:11:07,206 --> 01:11:09,007
[SPEAKER_03]: And reject false icons.

1077
01:11:09,127 --> 01:11:09,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Guitar Vader!

1078
01:11:10,969 --> 01:11:16,213
