00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,920
show tonight.

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,600
Speaking of AllGames.com, they've got something pretty big that they're airing this week and

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,320
it has to do with video game music, which the folks listening live heard during the

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,020
break there.

12
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:50,120
They're actually going to be airing the fourth annual Game Audio Network Guild Awards and

13
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,520
that's going to be on AllGames Radio.

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,000
That's AllGames.com.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,800
That's Thursday night at 11 p.m. Eastern, 8 p.m. Pacific, but they're going to have

16
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,080
a pre-show as well, so just tune in at 6pm Pacific and you'll be good.

17
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,860
They're actually going to have performing at the show this Guitar Hero Band.

18
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,600
And what they've done is they've actually gotten heroes of guitar playing to perform

19
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,600
at this band.

20
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,160
I don't want to read the entire list here, you guys can go to allgames.com and check

21
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,800
it out, but get this, Lyle Workman, who's a guitar player for Sting and Beck, and they

22
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:24,880
have Daryl Anders, who's the bassist for Tower of Power and Bonnie Hayes.

23
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,240
They also have Marcus Henderson, who's the guitar player for Drist and En Vogue, and

24
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,680
they just have like all these standout stars there that are going to be performing in this

25
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,680
band.

26
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,680
So that should be kind of fun.

27
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,440
So check that out, they're going to be airing that live over on All Games, our buddies over

28
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,440
there.

29
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,720
All right, so let's get into some news.

30
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,860
Last segment we talked about Katamari Damacy ending, sad.

31
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,840
We also talked about some big lies going around in the industry right now.

32
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,000
Big stinky ones.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,500
And now we're going to talk about some big acquisitions and things of that nature.

34
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,500
Loki, what's up?

35
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,280
Yes, tis the season to buy a company smaller than yours.

36
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,900
Starting off here with THQ, they're acquiring Vigil Games.

37
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:14,560
For those probably not very familiar with Vigil Games, they created both Marvel's Uncanny

38
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,900
X-Men and Battle Chasers series.

39
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:25,680
And so, I don't know, it's part of the studio system strategy, which is designed to foster

40
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:34,280
a singular vision and unique culture at each of our studios, according to Jack Sorensen,

41
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,600
the executive vice president of the worldwide studios at THQ.

42
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:45,000
And it's basically to inject more of that creativity into their games, I guess, where

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,120
it may be lacking.

44
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,120
Yeah, you know what? Actually, now that I think of it, THQ did create, I want to say, the outfit.

45
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,120
I don't know, that game was pretty fun.

46
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,120
Anyways, speaking of bigger fish in the pond, Sony.

47
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,120
They've signed a deal with PlayLogic for future first-party games.

48
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,120
And that should be pretty interesting.

49
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,120
Now, unfortunately, they haven't said what the game was.

50
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:16,120
But it is slated to come out on the PSP PlayStation 2, or possibly the PlayStation 3.

51
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,240
that's involved with Sony, but will be a first party game, so should be pretty cool.

52
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:26,360
And then finally, EA is actually going to be purchasing Battlefield Developer Digital

53
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,440
Illusion CE, better known as DICE.

54
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,580
And I think that's definitely a good move for them, seeing as Battlefield 2 has been

55
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:39,560
pretty successful, and especially since the 360 version is coming out next month, so.

56
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,560
That's right, and that's what I've got a story on, right here.

57
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,560
Battlefield 2 the demo is going to be coming out on March 24th over on Xbox live

58
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,640
The demo is actually going to have up to 24 players being able to play online

59
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,240
So this is kind of cool that a lot of the Xbox live demos lately have been

60
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,600
You know these

61
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,920
Big multiplayer things like the outfit and all that stuff so game even though they're not my type of games like I really tried

62
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,800
You guys I try to play battlefield 2 because everybody was just raving about it

63
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,960
But it's just it's just not my type of game. So you know maybe I'll check it out on Xbox live hell if it's free

64
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,820
Why not? I'll check it out, but I'm gonna suck and I'm gonna be I'm gonna be a detriment to any team

65
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:22,540
I'm on but check that out and it's it's coming out for the Xbox 360 in April. Yes

66
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:27,800
April the I'll say like the 11th or 12th now, so pretty soon just around the corner

67
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,400
Also some other quick news on Xbox Live you heard us in part a Loki was talking about feeding frenzy

68
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,400
That's out now on the Xbox Live Arcade

69
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,660
Also available on Xbox Live you can download now the Natasha betting field video for unwritten

70
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,660
Which is kind of interesting because now Xbox is starting to get into...

71
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,660
It's like Artist of the Month thing?

72
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,660
Yeah, they're doing this Artist of the Month thing, so it's kind of like to promote music.

73
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,660
But I have to say, I actually downloaded the video, because I kind of like Natasha Bedingfield, she's okay.

74
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,660
And the video looks great in High Def.

75
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,660
So that's kind of cool that they're making the music videos in High Def now.

76
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,660
And I haven't watched MTV in forever, so I didn't even know that they were making music videos in High Def.

77
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,660
But I guess that makes sense.

78
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,660
Just real quick, the Xbox Live Top 10 games of the week.

79
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,980
10 needs first speed most wanted, 9 the outfit demo, 8 Battlefield 2

80
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,220
which is amazing because how is that already there

81
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,880
when the games, or is it the old one, I'm thinking the old one on Xbox

82
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,900
yeah that's what it is okay and then 7

83
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,020
Project Gotham Racing 3, 6 Dead or Alive 4

84
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:29,100
5 Perfect Dark Zero, 4 EA Sports Fight Night Round 3, 3 Call of Duty 2

85
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,460
2 Ghost Recon 3 and number 1 is still Halo 2

86
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,740
Should we start a betting pool on when Halo 2 will actually be dethroned?

87
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:41,900
Halo 3? Yeah, Halo 3. Most likely. Actually, you know, to be honest, I don't think it is

88
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,660
gonna be Halo 3. I think it will be God,

89
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,060
or Gears of War will dethrone it.

90
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,060
It's a pretty bold assessment right there. Gears of War, pray.

91
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,540
Both those are going to be extremely good. In my heart, it never made it that far.

92
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:59,820
And notice, amidst all that Xbox Live news, not a single word

93
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,620
on when we're getting that Street Fighter. Was it supposed to come out late March?

94
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:08,260
I think the 24th was the day. We got 10 days! 10 days Capcom!

95
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,500
Xbox, get that stuff out there. I wanna play it.

96
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,340
Alright, I want my achievement points for beating the game with Chun-Li a hundred times.

97
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,820
Well, I heard that the reason why it wasn't out yet is because they're having trouble

98
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,580
with lag.

99
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:23,100
Lots of lag. Or that part of lag.

100
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,860
Fine, if they have to spend extra time to make it work good then that's fine

101
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,540
because we don't want them releasing it and just patching it later to make up for it.

102
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,460
That's fine, but a status check would be nice, guys.

103
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:37,020
Alright, moving on to another

104
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,340
completely different topic, Dark Sakura. We talked about Silent Hill a little bit

105
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,380
in part A, but this is

106
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:46,180
not about the movie necessarily, kinda sorta. There's actually

107
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,820
a talk from OneUp stating that

108
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,300
there's going to be a Silent Hill remake

109
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:58,980
on the PS2. Konami's been all happy over the

110
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,940
you know, the talk about the movie so there's a

111
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:06,060
rumor that they are going to re-release

112
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,700
the first game though with Harry Mason's wife who is the

113
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:15,720
heroine of the movie. So it does have to do with the movie after all, so...

114
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,540
Yeah, it's sort of a tie-in. I think that that's a good idea but

115
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,900
you know, they'd have to make some changes

116
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,020
It'd have to be an alternate universe sort of thing.

117
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,300
Wouldn't that have to kind of come out like very soon

118
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,200
if they wanted to promote the movie or maybe they're gonna wait for the DVD

119
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:32,840
release?

120
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,220
Wait for the DVD release? Because you want to see how well the movie does first

121
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,700
before you go and make a game about it.

122
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,220
Wouldn't that be a great combo pack though? DVD and game? No.

123
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:46,020
Why not? I think they've tried it. Sony does that. Oh no, I'm thinking of the PS3.

124
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,580
Yeah! Sony did do that once. They did, oh what was it? Stealth in the Wipeout Stealth.

125
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,000
which woo! No, that didn't sell very well. My bad, sorry.

126
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,620
By the way, it still sucked. I'll take your word for it.

127
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,660
Is this something you'd probably check out, Jamie, being a fan of Silent Hill?

128
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,940
Oh, of course. Yeah, I think I would too. Absolutely. Even though remakes can be a little

129
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:08,020
and sometimes, I mean, sometimes they're really good, and I think back to, of course, Mario

130
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,220
Brothers All-Stars on the greatest remakes they ever did.

131
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:14,140
Hello? Alright, it was a big week for announcements,

132
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:19,260
especially if you're rare, right, Loki? I don't know if you'd call it big, but

133
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,880
well i don't know it's it's different for those who say that xbox 360 is all

134
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,620
about shooters and racing games

135
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,620
xbox 360 is also

136
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,180
all about

137
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,940
crap and that is what is coming out from Rare

138
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:39,940
they announced a game called viva pinata yes hooray pinatas it's a game

139
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,380
which is going to have a cartoon based on it

140
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,620
about a living island of pinatas

141
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,500
And what, may you ask, pinatas do?

142
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:55,060
Well, they have to fix this garden that has kind of gone awry,

143
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:00,820
and you have to lure your fellow pinatas to your garden.

144
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,060
So that's what that second to last VG Cats was about.

145
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,620
I didn't get it.

146
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,780
It just all came together.

147
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,860
It just dawned on me.

148
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,140
Oh my god, it was so much fun.

149
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,860
So what is this, Xbox's response to Animal Crossing, right?

150
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,060
Is the easy way to put it?

151
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:21,120
They're trying to make a Pokemon and goddamn it. They're gonna be damned if it'll happen cuz aren't they just supposed to do like a

152
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:29,180
TV show in all night. Oh, yeah, oh boy a TV show now if I count pinatas if I come into a town of Evo

153
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,460
Pinata and start regulating with a baseball bat will I get lots of candy no

154
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:38,760
This is the only way I'd want this game to come out if you could play a little kid who fucking goes around the giant

155
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,620
Stick and beats the shit out of these stupid animals and steals their candy that is the game

156
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,380
I want okay grand theft pinata at one

157
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:52,500
I have to ask why all this hate for Viva pinata before you have you seen the website?

158
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,980
Seriously, have you seen the way I saw screenshots. I have not seen the website in the web

159
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:04,660
No, I have not seen the website. The website is like some Shrek wannabe crap. These characters come out

160
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:10,340
They even know like what the hell a game based on pinatas. I mean, it's seriously I

161
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,620
I don't know it sounds like it could be innovative

162
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,900
but the way they're doing like you know Xbox Live where you can

163
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,420
you know communicate with other players and send your pinatas to their

164
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,780
stuff to kinda make it like Animal Crossing type of thing

165
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:27,020
but really it looks stupid

166
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,220
it looks stupid then

167
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:34,060
we have chat chatters that disagrees andersy in our term says Viva Pinata

168
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,540
looks awesome seriously

169
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,980
is it just because maybe this isn't your kinda thing

170
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,740
No. It was Penny Arcade, not VGCats by the way.

171
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:47,100
Oh. Penny Arcade. Their comic was hilarious. But no seriously,

172
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,900
I have seen the website. I watched the little flash video that they have where they're

173
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,900
like doing like screen tests of this

174
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:58,500
you know, Viva Pinata thing. It looks like it's a bad Pixar movie gone awry.

175
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,780
And I don't know, it could be cool.

176
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:05,140
They could come out of nowhere, make it cool, but you know what? I think this is just gonna be

177
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,300
another failed attempt

178
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:12,660
Like cameo because cameo to be honest wasn't that great of a game. It was supposed to be a Zelda killer wasn't it quite

179
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:18,580
No, it's not as early. It's it's an okay game. It's you know, it's pretty much if you're an adventure gamer person

180
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,580
It's pretty much your only choice right now and it's okay

181
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:25,300
It just it feels like it could have been done on the regular. It feels like there's really

182
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,260
Fable was almost just the same

183
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,740
type of thing in many ways

184
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,580
Props are rare for at least trying something different.

185
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,020
The only problem is, I don't like the idea how they're putting out this cartoon thing

186
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:43,140
to go with it, because all they're trying to do is like, well kids like cartoons, cartoons

187
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,520
sold Pokemon, let's, I mean, I don't know.

188
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,020
You know what, I applaud them for doing something different besides the usual Xbox fare which

189
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:57,540
turns a lot of people off to the system, which is sports, shooters, you know, and all those

190
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:01,500
types of games you know we need we need some more variety in the Xbox lineup so

191
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,420
I'm happy they're trying. Rare needs to just put out another goddamn killer

192
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:11,420
instincts game. Can they though? I don't think they can. Well fine make something

193
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:15,300
else that's similar. Alright. Just make another fighting game or something or

194
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,740
put out something really good I mean seriously go to the website if you think

195
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,540
I'm you know lying about how crappy this game is go to the website. Which most of our chat

196
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,260
room does disagree with me. Okay and go to the website, watch the video and tell me if

197
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:31,740
you're not pissed off at this game after you watch the video. Seriously.

198
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,600
I want a pinata game like a first-person shooter, so you go around and shoot the pinatas and

199
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,220
then you have to go get the candy. Get candy! That'd be awesome.

200
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:43,940
Alright, I sense all this rage coming from Loki over there, so I think it's time to do

201
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:50,180
our FUs of the week. DarkSakura, are you ready to inject some rage into this episode of Orange

202
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,180
Launch Radio? Shut up and play the music!

203
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,180
Alright.

204
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,180
Sigh.

205
00:12:54,180 --> 00:13:17,740
My FU of the week goes towards education because I've been having to deal with, I dropped a

206
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:24,820
and then I have a she's such a smart lady a great teacher but she tells us

207
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,740
there's this assignment due and the assignments on the assignment page it's

208
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,620
just read chapter so what do you do you know it just bugs me that there's this

209
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:37,020
expectation that we don't have lives outside of class so we are given just

210
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:41,060
buttloads of homework to do and some of us work full-time so what's up with that

211
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:47,060
and it's not a very big F.U. but that's what's been on my mind.

212
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,060
Alright. Loki, your F.U.

213
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,060
My F.U. is the bad driver, so get this.

214
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:59,060
I was driving down the freeway today, going to go check out Tux's for the wedding,

215
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:03,060
and I see some dumbass pulling off to the side of the road.

216
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:08,060
He's like, because he missed his, you know, intersection or turn or whatever, off the freeway.

217
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:12,300
the friggin idiot starts backing up on the freeway

218
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,420
backing up! flip the goddamn thing in the reverse!

219
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:19,700
who was driving? oh god damn woman in a fucking SUV!

220
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,900
bad! bad people! was she on her phone?

221
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:29,060
oh she probably was but I didn't bother to look because there's a giant trail of smoke

222
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,540
from her

223
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:34,560
skidding into the god damn side of the road there. stupid people out there

224
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,560
And I see it daily!

225
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,560
Grrrr! Curses!

226
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:46,560
Um, my FU would go to weekends, or should I say actually the work week, because weekends aren't long enough.

227
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:53,560
I really feel like I haven't done, I mean, don't get me wrong, I've actually done a lot, a lot of stuff this weekend, but not enough.

228
00:14:53,560 --> 00:15:00,560
I kind of wish there was more time in the weekend, because I really have had no time to just kind of lie on the couch and go,

229
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,280
I'm just relaxed in the day. So F you to

230
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,400
Our society only allowing us two days on the week with weekend. I think that's crap. I

231
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,540
Think we should work for two days in a week and get a five-day weekend though. We rock

232
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,040
Of course, I'm just lazy. Oh

233
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,080
I'm still on the topic of pinata by the way

234
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,960
They still can't get over that pinata thing. I'll have Grand Theft pinata

235
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,680
Metal Gear pinata. Mm-hmm

236
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,680
Katamari piñata.

237
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,680
Fun.

238
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,680
They always take one gag a week and run with it, don't they, in chat?

239
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,680
You did not just bring up the Viva Piñata website over there.

240
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,680
Oh my god.

241
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,680
Ooh, it does look like a Shrek ripoff. Wow.

242
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,680
Yeah. Well, we'll see. I'll check it out later.

243
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,680
That's so funny!

244
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,680
I'll check it out later. We'll see.

245
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,680
Anyway, I want to get onto another topic here.

246
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,680
Kotaku.com has recently posted some images...

247
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,820
images what pinata Mamie

248
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:02,180
to do that I think you're laughing at Kotaku like that's not very nice there

249
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,280
they're respected site

250
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:07,600
I Kotaku.com recently posted some pictures you have to go back to

251
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,240
March 15th though of the Game Boy Advance SP

252
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,880
in pretty pink now with a brighter backlit screen or should I say

253
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,560
pearly pink is actually the color they're going for there

254
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:26,560
I don't know. Why do you think that they might be trying to release a pink Game Boy?

255
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,560
They're not getting enough female players.

256
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:36,560
All females buy anything that's pink. It's bred into their DNA.

257
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,560
I know a lot of males that would be interested in the pink system.

258
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,560
I know a lot of males that would be interested in the pink system.

259
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:49,920
They're just not the typical mindset that a lot of game companies cater to.

260
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,920
Let's just leave it at that.

261
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,960
My Game Boy Advance, however, was pink, because I did it just so that, you know, people couldn't

262
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,960
pin me down to any one particular thing.

263
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,960
Gotcha.

264
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,960
Yeah.

265
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,960
Okay.

266
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,560
I also have an afterburner in it.

267
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,560
All right.

268
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,600
I really only brought that up so we could tie into our next story that's going to be

269
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,920
brought to us by Dark Sakura.

270
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,920
Yep.

271
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,840
It's actually our website of the week.

272
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:18,840
Our website of the week! Well, here we go then. Let's bring in the theme music.

273
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,240
You like to surf the internet and find a great website for us every week, don't you?

274
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:28,720
Actually, this one was linked to me by a friend of mine.

275
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,160
It's on The Escapist

276
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,800
and the article can be found at www.escapistmagazine.com

277
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:50,060
And I'll go ahead and read off just the first paragraph, it's by somebody named Whitney

278
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,060
Butts.

279
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,820
It says, I am a girl on the internet, yes I said it, a girl on the internet, there really

280
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:59,100
are quite a few of us, I can type, I can play games with the best of you, and you my friend

281
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,360
were about to get owned by a girl.

282
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:09,160
It's basically the story of somebody who's been playing World of Warcraft and no one

283
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:13,240
believed that she was a girl or thought that she was a girl speaking for her boyfriend

284
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,680
on the chat or was not.

285
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,680
She's very pretty.

286
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,680
There's a picture of her on the site.

287
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:26,000
I read the article when you posted it on our secret place that we put all the stories up.

288
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,880
I read it and I thought it was very interesting.

289
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,160
the IRC conversations that she posted in those chat logs.

290
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,360
I was like, I actually wanted to do it.

291
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,600
We didn't have enough time to prepare it,

292
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,760
but I actually wanted to do IRC theater

293
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,920
where we were gonna interact the dialogue here.

294
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,320
But it's just amazing, the, for lack of a better word,

295
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,640
stupidity of people.

296
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,920
And my mother used to use this term a lot

297
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,280
and I hated it then, but it's the only way

298
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,680
I can think of to describe this hardheadedness

299
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,960
of the youth that OMG, she's a girl.

300
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:08,280
I got it on Dragon Rock before, and it's either that or, you know, people say, like, I would

301
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:14,280
get it every so often back when I was a moderator on DDR Freak, it was either, oh my god you're

302
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,280
a girl or oh my god you're not Asian.

303
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,280
Yeah?

304
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,280
Because that's that stereotype that only Asians play DDR.

305
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,360
Oh my god you're not an Asian boy!

306
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,300
I would I actually got it when I played tetranet you know but I would I would

307
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:35,100
actually when I used to list my video game collection on places people go you

308
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:40,780
can't have all that because you're a girl why where is there some type of law

309
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:45,900
that says I can't be good at video games and I can't enjoy video games because I

310
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:51,580
have boobs in a uterus okay where is that law I'd like to see it so that I

311
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,160
and set it on fire.

312
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,600
And you know, it's interesting because there was also one of those IRC logs

313
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,920
talked about where she responded

314
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,360
that she said something about like, oh, I really like Johnny Depp or

315
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,960
something, and one of the people said,

316
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,960
that's gay, what are you, gay?

317
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,320
And I was kind of like,

318
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:13,400
so what if it was a gay person? You know, obviously as a gay gamer myself,

319
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,400
I face sometimes a lot of these same types of issues that you're

320
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,680
bringing up as well, where people like go,

321
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,360
oh my gosh you're actually gay and then like you know they'll shut up for a long

322
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,320
time

323
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,600
you know and it's kinda like it's just like

324
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,240
or sometimes I've gotten that where it's like

325
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,580
you're gay you shouldn't be playing video games you should be like you know being in a

326
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,840
musical and listening to barbara stryzan

327
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,960
ok let me be the first to tell you

328
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,920
i fuckin hate barbara stryzan ok i hate her i hate her music i hate her movies i

329
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,140
hate everything about barbara stryzan

330
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,580
she's like butter

331
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:47,320
no she's like shit i can't i don't i don't like her at all

332
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,480
my mom likes her a lot but that's my mom

333
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,100
uh... so you know it's a it's a type of stereotypes i really hate it's like so

334
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,180
what if i'm gay i can play video games just like anybody else

335
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,020
so what if you're a girl you know how to pick

336
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,460
we've all got hands

337
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,780
that's all you need to use a controller right

338
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:05,580
well and apologies to any of you guys who you might have had amputation

339
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,200
i think that this device is for you to

340
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,100
is also that this link i've actually seen some play with the joysticks in

341
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,100
their chin

342
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,740
and that there's also uh... a little another thing i want to read on here

343
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:21,460
You know it's just because a girl plays video games doesn't necessarily mean

344
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:25,260
she's going to instantly put her picture up on the Internet for you know the male

345
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,060
population to drool over because it's a woman that plays a game.

346
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,380
I'm going to go ahead and quote her on this again if nobody minds.

347
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,900
Again a girl who doesn't show her picture on the Internet is not a girl and the

348
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,860
only girls on the Internet are actually guys who are just trying to get free

349
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,180
stuff.

350
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,660
Don't get me wrong I haven't gotten free stuff before.

351
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,540
No I have gotten free stuff before but I don't solicit it.

352
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:48,740
Not like those quote girls who sit around dancing for tips and games

353
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:53,140
You know who you are and you know, you're not a real girl real girls don't exist on the internet

354
00:21:53,140 --> 00:22:00,100
Yeah, FYI guys if you think every girl that you run into in an MMO is actually a girl

355
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:04,940
Just like if you assume that every guy you run into on an MMO is actually a guy

356
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,020
You are an idiot

357
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:14,660
I've played male characters before and I've played female characters before and it's not because I'm gay

358
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:19,020
I had on my Ragnarok account. I played a male so that I could play a bard

359
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:25,060
Yeah, how many of you guys out there? How many of you straight men out there have ever played Street Fighter 2 is Chun Li

360
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:31,300
Did that make you gay? No, did it make you feel like less of a man or not? So fresh?

361
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:38,540
No, it's just another character in a game the exact same thing in an MMO acceptable because she has big jugs. Oh stop

362
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:42,100
shut up stop it

363
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:46,300
but the whole thing just really gets me because and I have

364
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:50,700
you know being a female gamer it's even worse though being a female gamer with

365
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,240
the voice in the community though

366
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,060
because you know I admitted I've gotten some hate mail from people who have

367
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:56,980
literally told me

368
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:00,040
to get off the radio and get back in the kitchen

369
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:05,820
what the fuck century is this excuse me

370
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:11,100
what backwards ass country did you grow up in where they still have Neanderthals

371
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,900
in charge banging women on the head and dragging them around by their hair to

372
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:19,140
make them go cook them dinner though seriously the dark soccer is a pretty

373
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:24,020
good cook I will I will I am an excellent cook but then again you know

374
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:28,380
that's not the point I also don't clean house I make my husband do it I have a

375
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:35,020
house husband all right no for real no but the thing is is you know even even

376
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:38,800
my husband's friends you know are a bit surprised that I'll go in there every so

377
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:44,140
often and play games with them and you know regularly own people on like you

378
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:48,460
know I am I have to say I when Tekken 3 was out I was the goddess of Tekken and

379
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:53,160
I used to go in there and so humble about it it's true I used to I used to

380
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,280
go in there and smoke all the boys and they'd be like oh my god I got beat by

381
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:01,680
a girl this is also Alabama but still I remember going into cyber station one

382
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:08,400
the same one I worked at and we had the brand new deluxe Tekken 3 there and these guys have

383
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,240
been there since the store opened at 9 a.m. I show up at 2 in the afternoon they've been doing

384
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,480
nothing but playing King all day doing the throw combos I go in there with Jhin and just knock

385
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,480
them off the machine. Didn't somebody actually tell you once like oh my god it's the girl that

386
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,680
plays Tekken? Yes. Like you're the girl, the only girl in the United States that's ever played Tekken.

387
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,880
back to Alabama

388
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,560
and ran into somebody at the arcade and I was like, yeah, I used to come in here all the

389
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,840
time and play Tekken. Oh my god, you're that girl that plays Tekken!

390
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:43,080
Like, you're the only girl in the universe that's ever played Tekken. Apparently I had been

391
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:47,120
talked about for a little bit after I left. I also was the one on campus who used to beat

392
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,080
people on a...

393
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,120
well, because we had a Darkstalkers machine. That used to be my game. That and

394
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,280
Killer Instinct.

395
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,400
But, you know, it gets me that

396
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,600
there's this whole thing that girls can't play games like that?

397
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,080
Either that or the girls who are like the uber sluts.

398
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,920
Well this ties into the next article that I'm gonna bring up here which I'm

399
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,640
sure will piss you off a little bit.

400
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:12,400
Here it is, it's located at www.kimrom.info is the little blog

401
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,600
and it's the blog post from March 8th and it goes

402
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,980
female gaming my ass. And I think I get the point that they're trying to make in

403
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:23,360
this article because they talk about like you know

404
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:29,800
They show these pictures, especially like a girl gaming website.

405
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,520
Another great example of how female gaming attracts attention is a new team who calls

406
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,280
themselves Can't Touch This.

407
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,600
The image below is their new homepage design.

408
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:43,440
It's totally an exploitation of women's site and it's pink and it shows a girl in a bikini,

409
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,000
a little butt, and I think what's kind of amusing is that they put a response like if

410
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,240
it was a guy's site.

411
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,600
You would never see this about guys, exactly.

412
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,240
That guy's ass is not attractive.

413
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,780
And then they also show this here, there is an interview there with Vildkaten, a Danish

414
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:06,180
female gamer, and along with the article is a shot of her not wearing a bra, holding a

415
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:13,160
gun with her legs wide open, and it is a little bit sensationalism and I can totally see where

416
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,500
this would piss someone off.

417
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,500
This is stupid.

418
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,500
It's right.

419
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,980
The sensationalism of girls playing video games just because they are girls and showing

420
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:25,300
off the tits and everything and like OMG this is what a girl playing a game looks like and

421
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:30,020
when you run into a girl team they're all gonna be babes and stuff no that's just that's

422
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:34,020
that's stupid and I agree with that portion of the article how the hell are you gonna

423
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:40,260
operate the mouse if you're holding a gun that doesn't work here's the problem the article

424
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:44,700
was written like I and this is my opinion here guys but I think the article was written

425
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:49,340
so trashy and so sensationalistic let me let me give you a way that this art the article

426
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,340
opens up here.

427
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,580
Men are better at computer games than women.

428
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,580
Big surprise.

429
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:58,300
We grow up playing games, we spend enormous amounts of time playing games, we consciously

430
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,720
dedicate time to better ourselves, and we are competitive by nature.

431
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,660
No wonder we're better gamers.

432
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:10,360
And I'm thinking like, okay, you've never seen a woman who's obsessed with soccer play

433
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,320
in soccer because those bitches are some of the most competitive women I've ever seen

434
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,320
in my life.

435
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,320
I mean, seriously.

436
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,800
I mean, just these broad generalizations

437
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,200
that the person's making here to open.

438
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,320
I don't know if they're doing this

439
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,140
for shock value or something,

440
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:26,160
but it just totally, like, when I read it

441
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,920
and it opened up with that, it totally,

442
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,640
like I was like, okay, I don't even,

443
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,640
even if there's a point in here somewhere,

444
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,480
it's lost on me.

445
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,040
Dark Soccer, I'm sure you felt similarly.

446
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,920
I did actually reply to this guy.

447
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,760
No.

448
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,660
An itemized, he actually replied to me too,

449
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,680
but he was just staying more of the same.

450
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,320
I listed an itemized bit,

451
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,960
And actually, what I first started off saying is, I wasn't going to dignify this poor excuse

452
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,560
for an editorial with a response, but perhaps I have a small responsibility to do so.

453
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,480
Nor were we going to talk about it on the show.

454
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,480
Oops.

455
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:00,560
But, you know, I think that this guy's idiocy should be pointed out, because this is an

456
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,480
attitude that's prevalent, though.

457
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:12,080
I understand wanting to see less of the, quote, hoochie gamers, you know, but it's like I

458
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,920
pointed out he's basically going from his male ego, that's all he was speaking from.

459
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:19,360
Here's another quote, but the real problem with female gaming is that female gamers in

460
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:24,480
general have the same ambitions as men, but they lack the dedication and drive to fulfill

461
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:32,200
those ambitions.

462
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,880
Let that quote speak for itself there, I mean it's just like, you know, I know plenty of

463
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,000
women who are very high level, in fact there was just an article that was floating the

464
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,240
internet this week about one of the girls who was on season 7 of Buffy, one of the other

465
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,480
slayers, is secretly a level 60 character in World of Warcraft.

466
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,960
So I'm like, you know what, girls can have that ambition and drive to succeed in a game

467
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,920
just like any guy, but you can't ever say, all girls, and you can't ever say all men

468
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,920
because you're going to be wrong.

469
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:07,040
One of my co-workers regularly talks to the guy in the cubicle across from me about her

470
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:14,040
level what close to 70 character on World of Warcraft and she's been wanting me to pay

471
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:21,180
for my account again. I have a friend who's like the C-mode goddess in Phantasy Star Online.

472
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:29,140
She just goes in there and smokes people. Why is it? Why do guys think this? I'm not

473
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:36,180
saying that all guys think this, but it does seem to be a pretty prevalent misconception

474
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:41,340
among male gamers.

475
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:45,380
I don't want to turn around the whole sexist thing myself, but I also think that a whole

476
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:51,380
big chunk of it is male ego being threatened by women being able to do something.

477
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:54,540
As some of it is, I would agree.

478
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:58,620
As a guy, I would agree, but granted, my perspective on the thing is different.

479
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:03,660
But it sounds to me, and I understand this guy's underlying point is that maybe he's

480
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:12,620
a little pissed off because these women get these big game scholarship deals or whatever,

481
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:17,940
the sponsorship deals because they have tits and ass and sell themselves as women.

482
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:23,060
It's just like when Paris Hilton was carrying around the PSP as like a status thing.

483
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,060
And I can understand.

484
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:27,020
Yeah, that ticks me off too, and I'm sure it ticks you off as well.

485
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:31,100
I don't want her representative of my fellow female gamers.

486
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,340
Paris Hilton didn't even know what the box was.

487
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:36,220
She's like, ooh, stuff.

488
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,060
I'm going to go lay on this.

489
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:40,100
Anyway, form your own opinions.

490
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,320
I wanted to bring it up because, like it or not, it is an article that's been circulating

491
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,940
a lot of the big news sites this week.

492
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:50,180
So check it out if you want, camerarom.info and blog from March 8th.

493
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:53,940
And I'm sure some of you guys want to respond to that, so we are going to open up our Skype

494
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,040
line at this time.

495
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:59,520
If you guys want to give us a call, you can give us a call on our Skype line.

497

501
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,300
Let's go to the phones.

502
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,380
Wow, they're lighting up tonight.

503
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,820
Let's start off with you.

504
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,700
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

505
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,700
Hi.

506
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,700
Hello.

507
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,700
Hi.

508
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,700
Hi, who's this?

509
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:40,860
Raven's Dolphin. Hello Raven's Dolphin, what's on your mind?

510
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,820
Hello. Well, I am a PSP gamer.

511
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:47,060
Uh-huh. And I see that you like,

512
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:51,380
you're just dissing it all night. Is there a particular part of the argument that

513
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,780
you don't like that I'm dissing on?

514
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:57,460
Well, there's lots of games that come out for it. There are a lot of games that come out

515
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:00,460
for the PSP, I'll give you that, but I'm gonna be honest, there just hasn't been a

516
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,900
whole lot that's really been that exciting to me, but that's not to say

517
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,860
that there isn't stuff coming up

518
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:09,900
that's exciting to me, such as, well, the Mega Man games were just released, and I still

519
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,100
need to check those out, but of course, me and my Katamari,

520
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:16,580
Luminous, I named as my game of the year last year, was a PSP game.

521
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:20,700
So, you know, there are things to like about the PSP. I just think that

522
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:26,300
you can't, it's not existing just to be a game system.

523
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,580
They're also trying to do a lot of other stuff with it, like, such as, you know, the

524
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,180
built-in web stuff, and the

525
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:37,940
Podcast downloads and the flash being incorporated into it and the i-toy and all that other stuff as well. Oh, okay

526
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:41,680
So was there anything else it was there anything else you want to say about that?

527
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:46,000
Yeah, I do. I bought Mega Man the two of them

528
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:51,480
Uh-huh. What'd you think about that? There's a little bit of lag. So just feel free to speak freely give your thoughts on that

529
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:56,700
I love them both. I thought powered up with the best. Well, I'm definitely gonna have to check it out

530
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,500
Yeah, you can download maps from it from their own servers

531
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:04,380
Well that's kind of cool and that's something you know that the DS doesn't do is like the

532
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:09,580
whole like I mean it's just now starting to get into the online interactivity thing so

533
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:12,660
you know Nintendo still has a long way to grow in that department but of course you

534
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:16,020
know when Metroid Prime Hunters is deciding but I like you know I like that idea of all

535
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:19,820
the expansions and all that stuff but anyway Ravenstaufen thank you so much for the call

Not much, except, can I rant about this one friend of mine?

587
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,880
I suppose. Is it gaming-related?

588
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,880
Mm, kinda. He's...

589
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:31,880
He's...

590
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,880
Well, okay, he's a pretty big PS tool.

591
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,580
Okay, so tell us- okay, get it- get the rant out.

592
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,080
He just, like, always...

593
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:45,080
This is like Nintendo and Xbox, just like everything else.

594
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,080
Like, if it's not Sony, this is it.

595
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,080
Why?

596
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,080
I don't know.

597
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:56,080
Well, uh, punch him in the face.

598
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,080
I don't know what else to tell you.

599
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,080
He actually punched him in the face once.

600
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:04,080
Has he ever actually played Microsoft or Nintendo products?

601
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:08,080
Uh, he played Pictochat on my DS?

602
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,440
yeah okay that doesn't fucking count I mean that's that's not even like a game

603
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,200
you need to sit that boy down tell him you know what you need to try it or you

604
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:21,880

00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:26,960

606
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:33,040
neo-nazi I just my dog I just my dad is my dog isn't that a bloom-chin song all

607
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,040
Alright, forget it.

608
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:38,640
Alright, we gotta let you both go buddy, have a good one, okay.

609
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,840
And kick that guy in the balls.

610
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,640
Let's go to one more call here.

611
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,160
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

612
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,160
Hello?

613
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,160
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

614
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,160
Oh, hi there.

615
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,160
Hi, who's this?

616
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,160
Funny Dale.

617
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,160
Hi, Funny Dale, what's on your mind?

618
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:56,580
I was going to talk about the issue you had a few minutes ago about the female gamers.

619
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,560
By all means, go for it.

620
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:03,600
And the reason why you see these websites, the FragDolls and the PMS Clan all have these

621
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:10,600
like young supermodels is because, well, I hate to say this, but a lot, a good portion

622
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:16,320
of the video game audience is a bunch of 15 year olds who, well, can't get laid, so, and

623
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,400
they shouldn't really be looking at porn, so the FragDolls are probably the closest

624
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,400
thing.

625
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,860
I, you know what, and I agree with that, I totally agree with what you're saying, FunnyDale,

626
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:31,120
Because it's apparent in what's happening with G4TV as well, right?

627
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,000
Because it was supposed to be like a network for games and it kind of turned into, it's

628
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,960
just geared at the young 15 year old males and stuff who can't get laid, right?

629
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,960
It's the same thing.

630
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:44,340
But here's the problem I see with that, is that if gaming truly wants to open its audience

631
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:49,340
to everyone, as you see that Nintendo is trying to do very badly, and granted Nintendo doesn't

632
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:53,380
sponsor any of this stuff, but I'm talking about the gamer community as a whole, if you

633
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:58,260
You want to be looked at as something other than a bunch of 15-year-old kids who can't

634
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,680
get laid.

635
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,300
This shit has to stop.

636
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:06,000
And that's what it's really about, and I think that's why we're here kind of speaking out

637
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
against it a little bit.

638
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,100
It's here to say, you know what?

639
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:14,800
Gamers come in all shapes, sizes, and types, and we like games, and we don't have to fit

640
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,260
into these certain stereotypes.

641
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:23,100
And it's just another sign of how stereotypes hurt society, and that goes in all facets

642
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:29,820
Why can't we go back to the wonderful, you know, flashback for me like 20 years ago.

643
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,900
Or maybe not even quite 20 years ago.

644
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,940
Let's go back to the time when gaming was real gaming.

645
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,540
We're talking the Nintendo World Championships.

646
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,540
God damn it.

647
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:43,780
Why can't we go back to simpler times where it was based on skill and not whether you're

648
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,180
a man or woman.

649
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:49,500
It's how well you're good at Super Mario Brothers, Rad Racer, and Tetris when the Power Glove

650
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,500
was so bad.

651
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,940
Yes, Collar, you were trying to get a point in there.

652
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:59,460
The problem with the argument is that game publishers are there to make money, and they

653
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,620
make money doing that.

654
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,700
Just look at MTV.

655
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:08,580
That's a good point, but also look at games like Tetris and Brain Training and the PopCap

656
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:12,300
games is another big one on the internet, popcap.com.

657
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:17,000
Those games and those types of things really reach to such a broader audience.

658
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,980
I think the publishers have to be willing to take a risk once in a while.

659
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:24,340
I think Tetris is the exception, not the rule.

660
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:28,480
It is, but I mean, you know, games like that, well I'm just saying, you know, games in general,

661
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,480
you know, it could be the rule that games, and I'm not saying that there can't be those

662
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,320
types of games, but I wish there would be more than that.

663
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,960
You know, we should have more of everything, you know what I mean?

664
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,800
A broader selection.

665
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:47,720
Well, as long as it makes them money, they'll keep on doing it, and that's unfortunate,

666
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,720
but it's true.

667
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,900
But again, that's why I vote with my dollars.

668
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,160
It's a point that came up in part A,

669
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,000
vote with my dollars.

670
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,800
I'm not gonna continue to support these games

671
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:01,160
that are all about the TNA.

672
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,520
Well, maybe Dead or Alive, though,

673
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,300
because that game's kind of fun.

674
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,840
When it's like total exploitation,

675
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,680
then it's kind of funny.

676
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,840
D.O.A. volleyball is fun.

677
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,640
I'm sorry, I even think that D.O.A. volleyball

678
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,600
was just hilarious.

679
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,740
All right, well, thank you, Funny Dale, for your call.

680
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,120
You seem pretty well informed.

681
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,880
I have some good points there, okay?

682
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,040
It's no problem, thanks.

683
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,040
Have a good one, buddy!

684
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,360
All right, thank you guys very much for the calls tonight on our Skype line.

685
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,360
We'll try to open that up again a little later if we have time, but we've got to keep moving

686
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,920
on for right now.

687
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,920
And we're going to move on to a story that I thought this was fascinating.

688
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:35,800
Loki, this is about what happens to prisoners.

689
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,800
Spoiled rotten prisoners.

690
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:42,400
Now, seriously, it's really interesting.

691
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,200
Now when you go to prison, you actually might be able to play video games.

692
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,200
That's right.

693
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:52,720
Inmates in Oregon can purchase a plug-and-play console, kind of like a kiosk to Nintendo,

694
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:58,840
with 50 embedded games and are mounted to an LCD TV if they behave.

695
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:06,040
Plus, I don't know, it's just really interesting that they're actually coming out with video

696
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,400
games from inmates.

697
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:14,200
I mean, come on, they're in there for... unless they're playing really crappy games, like

698
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,960
you know, E.T. or something like that for the 2600.

699
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:21,700
What I thought was funniest about that kind of, that article was that

700
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:26,520
like some stupid prison had allowed games like Grand Theft Auto and games

701
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,680
where you're killing cops to actually be played until they realized what was

702
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,960
actually in the game. Oh my god! I didn't realize there was cop killing and cop killer the

703
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,320
game. Your tax dollars at work.

704
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:41,360
But is this a good thing, a bad thing?

705
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:45,480
I don't know. I think it's a stupid thing. I mean, as it is, it costs us

706
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,200
a ton of money to keep prisoners in prison anyways. Why are we giving them the

707
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,080
luxuries of all this stuff? In fact, why the hell are we even heating their cells or

708
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:57,360
anything? I mean, it should be kept like Alcatraz.

709
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:02,440
What happened to the days when prisons were places where people went to be punished?

710
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:09,520
The thing is that I hear that this comes out to sort of

711
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,400
combat like prison riots. It's to try and de-stress the prisoners

712
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,000
but I'm kinda like you know what? You gotta figure out a different way to

713
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,840
break up prison riots.

714
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:22,200
They riot! We shoot them with a shotgun to the face! I mean, come on! It's pretty simple!

715
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,240
Now we're getting into pretty radical politics but yeah you gotta think of other

716
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,000
ways to combat

717
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,840
prison riots, you know? They're gonna riot if they don't have a face!

718
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:33,560
Don't let them out of their cell if they're gonna riot.

719
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,880
I like the running man because Richard Dawson was a villain

720
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,160
And that's awesome.

721
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,840
One thing that's certainly villainous in its own way is spam on the internet.

722
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,800
You know you guys hate getting spam mail.

723
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,800
Well guess what?

724
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:52,520
Now you can get spam on your Xbox 360 thanks to Burnout Revenge who encourages you to send

725
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:57,840
in-game clips to your friends and you even get achievement points when you do so, right

726
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,600
Loki who spammed me last week with this?

727
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,600
Sorry.

728
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,600
It's alright.

729
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,600
You didn't know.

730
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,720
But this is the thing is that now everybody's getting spammed with these messages because

731
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,720
Is it so easy to send your clips to everyone?

732
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,720
Well here's the reason why.

733
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,040
One of the achievements, and it's actually 60 points, which is pretty big, is to make

734
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:16,120
it to the top 20 clips on Burnout.

735
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:19,520
The problem is though, in order to make it up there, the top clip has like a thousand

736
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,760
views on it right now.

737
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:25,380
So you have to send it to a lot of friends to get that to happen.

738
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:28,560
So yeah, I think you guys need to be a little smarter when you're thinking of your achievement

739
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,960
points scales like that.

740
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:33,040
That's not an achievement in gameplay.

741
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,040
That's an achievement in whoring.

742
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:37,120
And to be honest, the replays are kind of retarded anyways.

743
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:41,520
I mean, I've made some pretty cool ones, but nothing like, oh my god, you have to see this,

744
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,960
except for the glitch that I saw, but I couldn't record that.

745
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,320
Alright.

746
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:50,480
Anyway, you got some hackin' and crackin' news, right, Loki?

747
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,680
Of course.

748
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:57,760
The first one, it's pretty major actually, was that the Xbox 360 DVD firmware has been

749
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:03,680
hacked, and there's a video of it, and basically the way it works is all Xbox 360 games that

750
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:10,880
come out there. Of course, they're all encoded so that you can't reverse engineer them and

751
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:21,120
stuff. So that's something. Plus, each single file type,.xex, has a media flag. Basically,

752
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:27,360
the media flag tells the Xbox what type of media it's on. Whether that be a CDR, DVD-R,

753
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:35,360
DVD Plus R, etc, etc, or DVD, Xbox, DVD, Xbox 360, so it knows what type of media it's on.

754
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:41,200
So, for example, I try to copy a game and I make a perfect copy, and it's on a DVD-R,

755
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:46,100
it's going to say, hey, this isn't a press CD, I'm not playing.

756
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:51,020
So what they did was they actually modified the DVD firmware not to make that check.

757
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:55,240
So if I make an exact copy of the game, it will run like nothing.

758
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:58,380
Of course as with all these exploits

759
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,880
the hacking group behind it is not releasing the firmware because

760
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:05,380
they don't endorse piracy they only endorse hacking

761
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:11,020
so okay so yeah it's not gonna be released but um

762
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:15,780
it can be done. Well somebody else will have to figure it out I suppose who doesn't endorse

763
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,440
piracy if that's what you're into

764
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,920
exactly and here's my thing because I remember back in the heyday

765
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,080
when I used to like import games I used to get HK copies

766
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:27,600
basically these were mass-produced pirated copies where they would be

767
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,360
pressed

768
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,920
why aren't these floating around out there

769
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,600
and I mean because if you can press an exact copy of the game

770
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:39,960
and it's on a DVD I mean shouldn't it work?

771
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,320
maybe? I don't know. Just a thought.

772
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:47,880
but anyways and of course some other cool stuff

773
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,960
of course on the PSP the first one is this

774
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:57,520
really strange stick minigame, it's like with stick figures, called Pointless Tormenting.

775
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:06,520
And it's basically, you torment stick figures. It's just really simple, it's kind of stupid,

776
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:10,560
if you're interested in it. Remember Stick Fighter? Stick Fighter was kind of fun. That's

777
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:16,200
all I wanted to say. It's on, you know, PSP updates, so you can check that out. Pretty

778
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:21,200
sweet. Another kind of cool game is another homebrew game that's been I think even on

779
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:28,280
the Dreamcast called Dragon Fighter. It's kind of like a Final Fantasy fighting game

780
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:34,040
almost. It has the really super deformed characters and stuff. Dragon Fighter version 0.2 was

781
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:38,200
released on the PSP so you can check it out. I think actually some of the graphics were

782
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:43,140
used from RPG Maker is where they based a lot of the songs. Check it out, it might be

783
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:47,760
something interesting. It's free. It's on PSP updates as well. Another one that I did

784
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:54,760
find that was kind of neat was this game called Erquon Masters. Now if you remember way back

785
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,080
in the day in DOS games there was this game called Star Control which was pretty sweet.

786
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:07,080
It was like a kind of a space shooter RPG type of thing. Well this is based on that

787
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:12,320
and it's also based on another knock off game called of course Erquon Masters. But check

788
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:17,800
Check it out, they have version 0.50 available and it looks pretty sweet.

789
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:23,480
If it's anything like Star Control or Star Control 2 was, really fun shooter game so

790
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,480
check it out.

791
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:30,260
Alright, we're now going to go ahead and let Dark Sakura dive in and open up our mailbag

792
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:33,840
when you guys send us letters to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

793
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:38,560
Dark Sakura likes to dig through the mailbag and pick out a few favorites to make fun of

794
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,840
here live on air.

795
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:40,840
I'm good at that.

796
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:41,840
No, just kidding.

797
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:46,040
We'll give some serious responses with our help here to this week's letters.

798
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,280
So let's open up the mail bag.

799
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,420
Who sent us the mail this week?

800
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:57,520
Siphaan wrote in and said, I've got another suggestion for the show.

801
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:01,400
How about making a question for the listener call-in section?

802
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:05,040
As it seems to me now, the call-in part is really people just doing a shout-out or whatever.

803
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,520
There doesn't seem to be any real structure.

804
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,560
If you were to pose a question early in the show, listeners would have time to think about

805
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:14,760
answers and could call in and discuss. I think it's okay to have random calls and

806
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,400
shout outs but it's not very interesting unless you have something to say. What do you think?

807
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:23,520
I think that's a good idea but I think I see a lot of other

808
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,640
podcasts that kind of do that and although I don't see a whole lot that

809
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:31,280
are interactive in that way a lot of them do it through email and things

810
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:35,400
like that and I kind of always like at least my envision of the show is that

811
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,040
things be like an open format and if somebody had a topic they wanted to

812
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,360
bring to us, they could do that on the Skype line.

813
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,320
So I'm not discounting your idea, it's a good one,

814
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:46,560
but I just, you know, I wanna keep that openness,

815
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,880
and I think Darkstalker and Loki agree here.

816
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,960
But certainly, you know what, I have an idea

817
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,160
that's very similar to what you're saying,

818
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,520
that you might see come up on a future show,

819
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,720
we just have to make sure the technology's in place.

820
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,040
However, that doesn't mean we might start getting

821
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,640
a little stricter with the Skype calls,

822
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,200
because I am getting a lot of feedback

823
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,140
from podcast listeners that some of the Skype calls

824
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:07,480
are kind of boring, so we may start having to cut

825
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,520
some of them from the show, like when people just call in to say hi and don't really have

826
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:13,360
anything to say, fortunately we're probably going to have to cut those from the future

827
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,600
podcast production.

828
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,820
So just kind of a word of warning though as you guys call into Skype, don't get us wrong,

829
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:20,960
we love to hear from you, but please have something to say.

830
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:27,880
And also please, that's gaming related, call Echo 1-2-3 so we don't hear this, yes, hi!

831
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:28,880
Yes.

832
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:29,880
Or when we hear ourselves say hi.

833
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:30,880
Hello!

834
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,320
Yeah, so you are going to see that starting in future weeks.

835
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:36,880
So you know, this is all kind of new to us, there aren't a lot of shows that do the interactive

836
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:40,320
so we're still kinda learning along with you but I think it's a good idea and I

837
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:43,200
think you'll see that we're gonna roll out something similar to that in the

838
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:43,880
future

839
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:47,480
so if you don't call Echo 123 before calling us we will send a Ninja

840
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:50,420
Death Squad after you. That's right.

841
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:53,460
We keep one in the closet

842
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:57,240
and a little storage shed outside. That's right. Also another question

843
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:00,260
he asks is WTF

844
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:04,560
have they done to Mega Man? Have you seen the screenshots from Mega Man powered up?

845
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:07,720
WTF, WTF, WTF.

846
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:08,960
Um, no I haven't.

847
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,360
Actually I haven't either. It's really super deformed.

848
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,080
He has a huge, ginormous head.

849
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:17,580
But it's a cool game! It really is a cool game. So,

850
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:20,200
you know what? It's a different art style. It's just like people go,

851
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,880
What the hell happened to Link?

852
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:25,120
He looks all cel-shaded and funky looking.

853
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,600
It's still a good game.

854
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:32,520
Except for the fact that the world was flooded and then when you go

855
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:38,640
to one spoiler part of this, you know, game when you see Hyrule's underwater, um, you're

856
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:42,600
like, why couldn't it have been that game, you know, where Hyrule's not underwater, but

857
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:50,600
whatever. Oh well. And more emails? Uh, actually yes, there is an email from Lauren. It says,

858
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:55,720
hey, I'm looking at full metal DDR pads on eBay, it looks like you can buy one for between

859
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:59,160
$100 to $500 plus, but I was wondering if you knew which manufacturers are the more

860
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:05,560
dependable blade ion etc one of these ones is I think it's the one that they

861
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:10,920
were selling it fries oh I've seen that pad before there oh it was broken here's

862
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,280
the thing here's that there's there's the problem with it right there you see

863
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,160
how it says what is this one we're looking at here the eBay one who makes

864
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:20,480
this one that's I can't find the manufacturer oh this way I've bought a

865
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:25,560
me a metal you a pad okay the ones that are like you know like an inch thick or

866
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:31,880
something and that sucker bent here here's the one that I was at e3 my

867
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:36,200
iguana girl got injured on yeah and the problem with that the one that you're

868
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:39,600
looking at there on eBay it says wireless you don't want a wireless

869
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:43,280
controller with a music game because there's too much of a risk even for the

870
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:47,680
slightest amount of lag will screw up your music game so don't don't get that

871
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:51,520
honestly guys you want a reliable metal pad to go to the people have been doing

872
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,960
it forever red octane you know we've given them a hard time in the past about

873
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,800
in the groove and stuff but you know guitar hero is pretty rockin and they do

874
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:03,400
make some solid controllers honestly the afterburner is is the place to be for

875
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:09,000
that their stuff has always been high quality yeah except for one particular

876
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,160
game in my opinion but other people feel differently so that's just my opinion or

877
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:21,960
build your own we also have the last two emails are from our friend Rob rockin to

878
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:27,240
read this a friend asked me to advise on streaming HDTV to his TV from his PC so

879
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:32,460
I looked it up if you go to Windows MCE the Windows MCE route there are

880
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:37,020
two Microsoft devices they recommend the Xbox 360 and Windows Media Extender on

881
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:42,580
the Microsoft page for MCE Windows Media Extender is downplayed almost completely

882
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:48,480
in favor of the Xbox 360 they really want to push those boxes okay interesting

883
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:56,520
point. And then the other thing is actually a link from, I guess, GamaSutra. There is

884
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:03,360
an article here about ESA files to retrieve Illinois bill game legal costs.

885
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:07,480
Ah, yes, the legal, you know, I've got to admit I've been trying to stay on what's going

886
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:12,380
on with the bills and the gaming through game politics because I have them friended on my

887
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:17,240
live journal, but there's just so much going on in so many different places, it's hard

888
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:20,080
to keep track of to bring you guys on the show but I thought I did think this

889
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,920
was interesting I saw a little bit about this so good

890
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:26,240
well just to read the first paragraph in this article in a recently bold new move

891
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:30,080
the game industry trade association with the entertainment software Association

892
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:34,080
has filed a petition to the United States District Court asking it to order

893
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:37,320
the state of Illinois to pay six hundred forty four thousand five hundred and

894
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:41,320
forty five in legal fee that's our dollars in legal fees for its

895
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:45,800
unsuccessful efforts to enact a law banning the sale of violent video games

896
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,000
in the state.

897
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,940
Trying to collect some of that money back that was lost on these bills that are way

898
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:55,040
too radical for their own good.

899
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,640
I think this is a very important point just to quote.

900
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:02,400
The judge was Matthew S. Kennelly when he declared the law unconstitutional.

901
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,420
His comment was, if controlling access to allegedly dangerous speech is important in

902
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:10,920
promoting the positive psychological development of children, in our society that role is properly

903
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:16,640
accorded to parents and families, not the state.

904
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:23,960
If you've got some e-mails you want to send along, mailbag at orangelauntrader.com is

905
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:26,720
a place to do it.

906
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:30,000
Let's move on to some more news and of course you know I couldn't get through the show without

907
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,240
bringing up something related to Final Fantasy XI.

908
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:39,480
There's new information coming out about Treasures of Otte, Oregon thanks to the event that happened

909
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:43,680
recently there, what was that in, I want to say Santa Cruz, I know it was somewhere in

910
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:47,280
California they had this big event, a live event, and they showed the new trailer and

911
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,160
everybody was cheering, well there's some new information on what's coming with the

912
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,360
game and this sounds like it's going to be a much more thorough expansion than Chains

913
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,360
of Promothea was.

914
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:59,480
Chains of Promothea was like new missions, new areas, woo, but this is a whole lot of

915
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:00,480
new stuff.

916
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:05,140
Besieged mode, this is where the enemies are going to start taking over the towns and you

917
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:08,560
actually fight to keep over the town, I think that's kind of neat.

918
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:11,020
There's also going to be an assault mode.

919
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:15,940
This is where if you're over level 50, you can just play for an hour or so, and you don't

920
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:19,640
have to assemble a giant party, you just go to take a huge quest.

921
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:24,960
This is a direct response to, it takes me too long to find a flippin' party, I want

922
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:28,740
to do something casually that doesn't take me all night long, so I think that's a good

923
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:33,580
idea except for the fact that it's limited to over level 50, because that kind of defeats

924
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:36,980
the purpose in many ways, because it takes a while to get to level 50, but okay, we'll

925
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:40,860
We're not even going to talk breaking the 50 cap and how hard that is.

926
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:46,740
We'll wait and see how that turns out before we make our final decisions on that.

927
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:50,960
Also we do know that there's going to be a brand new job class, the Puppet Master is

928
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,740
going to be a new job class along with the previously announced Corsair, who you might

929
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:57,900
as well call a pirate, and Blue Mage that were previously announced.

930
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:59,620
Wasn't that a movie?

931
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:00,620
Puppet Master?

932
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:01,620
I think so.

933
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:04,060
I don't remember if it was Puppeteer or Puppet Master.

934
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:05,060
Is it Puppet Master?

935
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:09,100
That just now has me thinking of a person with little creepy puppets going around.

936
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:10,100
That's actually what it is.

937
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:11,100
That's what it is.

938
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:12,100
That's cool!

939
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:13,100
Oh my!

940
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:14,100
Whoa!

941
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:16,440
We've got dark soccer to say something complimentary about Final Fantasy XI.

942
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:17,440
Someone note the date and time.

943
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,440
I'm blaming it being scary.

944
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:20,440
But you know what?

945
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,980
We've had village raids for years in Ragnarok Online.

946
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:25,940
Yeah, but that's just the GMs playing tricks on you.

947
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:26,940
So?

948
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:27,940
Alright.

949
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:30,680
Anyway, also this is very cool as well.

950
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:36,600
Chocobo racing is going to be incorporated into Final Fantasy 11 along with breeding.

951
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:40,720
So those of you guys that love to raise your own chocobos in Final Fantasy 7, now it's

952
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,360
going to be incorporated into Final Fantasy 11.

953
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:44,360
That is pretty cool.

954
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,360
I got to say my hat's off to them.

955
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,360
Can you get a black one?

956
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:47,360
Can you get a gold one?

957
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:48,360
I have no idea.

958
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:49,360
We won't know until it comes out.

959
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,800
You have to go race them at the gold saucer?

960
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,040
I don't know.

961
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,040
We'll see.

962
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:56,560
Also there's going to be a Mog Locker.

963
00:57:56,560 --> 00:58:01,080
You can buy it for a price and hold additional items as well, for those that say my Mog House

964
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:06,080
won't hold enough, and that's also kind of the reason why people go and get a mule.

965
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:10,360
You know, a mule is a secondary character that you have to pay real life money to get.

966
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:14,400
Also, now there's going to be a Colosseum.

967
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:18,680
Don't really know what it's going to be yet, they just said a Colosseum.

968
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:22,640
Well they have PVP and Ballista, so we don't know if it's going to be PVP or if it's going

969
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,760
to be like like think about Final Fantasy 6 had a Colosseum and you would

970
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,880
like kind of bed an item and then depending on if you won you get

971
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,960
something better so who knows it could be a variety of things so we shall see

972
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,600
so pretty exciting and this is an addition to new areas and stuff so it

973
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:41,520
sounds like Final Fantasy 11 is learning from the poor reviews of Chains of

974
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:45,560
Promothea and kind of adding a lot more oomph into this expansion it's gonna get

975
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:48,200
some people back into the game here I come

976
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,900
enough said well that's not the only thing squares working on though right

977
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:58,900
right? I should say Squeenix. They're working on another MMO. What's this? Well, it's just

978
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:04,900
a brand new MMO. It's not going to be Final Fantasy related, you know, but... Tracking

979
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:11,740
Quest Online! But, uh, other details beyond that, nothing. They just know that they're

980
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:18,260
working on it, so. Final Fantasy 13? Probably not. It could be Final Fantasy, it could be

981
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:22,780
I did remember hearing them, they were working on another game and I do remember seeing something

982
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:23,780
about this.

983
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:27,100
It wasn't Final Fantasy, I can't remember what it was though, something that was like

984
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,100
out of E3 last year.

985
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:31,560
I seem to remember vaguely hearing something about this too, so I wonder if this is related

986
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:33,700
or if it's something completely different.

987
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:34,700
I don't know.

988
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:37,980
But, yeah, we'll see.

989
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:41,700
Alright, we're going to move on here now.

990
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:46,700
I know that I don't get a website of the week segment here on this show, but let's pretend

991
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:55,840
for once that I did get a website of the week segment.

992
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:58,660
This would be my website of the week if I had the opportunity.

993
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:09,240
It's a brand new website that launched this week, www.videogamevoters.org.

994
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:16,260
It's basically a place for you as a registered voter to take a stand against politicians

995
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:21,860
who come up with these harebrained bills about preventing the violent video games.

996
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:24,820
Once in a while, depending on the wording of the bill, it can be okay, but I'm talking

997
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:30,060
about the cases where they compare the games to pornography and all that stuff.

998
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:33,100
So I've been saying throughout the past couple of shows, vote with your dollars, so now here

999
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:40,280
you can vote with your votes, and it's basically a place to get people mobilized for action

1000
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:45,300
in the political world in the name of gaming, and I think it's great.

1001
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:48,220
Here's a little quote from the website about what they're all about there.

1002
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:52,940
The Video Game Voters Network exists to empower Americans who play video games to take action

1003
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:57,060
against threats to this entertainment medium and to stay informed about the latest issues

1004
01:00:57,060 --> 01:00:59,880
that could affect our choice in video game entertainment.

1005
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:03,860
Video games are a modern form of entertainment entitled to the same creative and free speech

1006
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:09,980
protections afforded by the U.S. Constitution to older media such as movies, music and books.

1007
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:14,060
So join the Video Game Voters Network and speak up for games and gamer rights.

1008
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:19,940
a stand protect your games that's www.videogamevoters.org I urge you to sign

1009
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:24,240
up for this site even if you don't agree with all of it maybe you'll find that

1010
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:27,140
once you've read it you don't agree with everything maybe that they're gonna do

1011
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:33,000
at least you're educated and knowing is half the battle right yo Joe so bravo to

1012
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,400
those guys for starting that up I think it's a good idea to get everybody

1013
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:39,280
together to take action against this stuff and speak up and say you know what

1014
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:43,280
gamers aren't a bunch of 15 year old guys who can't get laid there's a lot of

1015
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:47,160
gamers over 18 who vote you guys in office and if you're gonna continue to

1016
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:51,040
be ignorant about gaming which is what a lot of this stuff ends up being is

1017
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:55,520
ignorance about gaming then we're going to remove you from office and put

1018
01:01:55,520 --> 01:02:00,920
someone in there who's not as ignorant good idea any last-minute stories anyone

1019
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:06,120
wants to share but of course all right what's up kind of on the same you know

1020
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:12,740
level as half-life 2 survivor for the arcade global VR developer of arcade

1021
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:18,340
Machines has announced a new title for conversion to the arcade play and that

1022
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:24,200
would be Ubisoft's Far Cry Instincts, the console version of the Far Cry series.

1023
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:31,960
Crysis is coming to the arcade and that should be pretty sweet. It will include a

1024
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:36,680
high-definition monitor on deluxe systems and surround sound so realistic

1025
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:40,000
players will feel like they're right in the middle of the action. Of course EA

1026
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,320
sports is also developing an arcade edition of the Nascar game as well so

1027
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:52,800
I have one for you Rob about Sid Meier. Cool! A new PC game that will allow you

1028
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:56,720
to build your very own rail network lane tracks and deciding routes

1029
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:59,920
and designing trains called railroads with an exclamation point. Wait but there

1030
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:04,720
was railroad tycoon. Alright it wasn't Sid Meier's railroad. Okay fine alright so fine

1031
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:09,200
railroads. It's titled Sid Meier's railroads. Alright. It's a click and drag system delay

1032
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:15,120
tracks, bridges, tunnels, blah blah blah. You can also, not only as your rail network

1033
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:21,520
grows cities, industries, you organize cargo transport, provide passenger routes for commuters.

1034
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:28,960
Fend off hobos. Stop it. You know, you'll need to basically watch the business side

1035
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:32,520
as you are also dealing with the technical side. You know who will like this game a lot?

1036
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:35,660
My dad. Because he used to work for the railroad. He's retired now but he worked for the railroad

1037
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:38,840
so he loves these types of things, so I'll share this with him.

1038
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:44,680
You also have the ability to make your own maps and scenarios and do your dream layout

1039
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:47,660
in train table mode.

1040
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:52,840
And you can also challenge historical figures like Cornelius Vanderbilt and JP Morgan.

1041
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:56,720
So okay, that's kind of interesting because it's like the civilization aspect there in

1042
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:57,720
railroading.

1043
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:58,720
That's cool!

1044
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:05,280
And it has LAN or online play, competitive, cooperative, so it's going to be pretty big.

1045
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:09,100
Again, Railroad Tycoon is one of those

1046
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:13,260
great classic games that you should definitely check out if you're

1047
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:14,620
interested in something like if you're

1048
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:18,620
you know kinda younger or into gaming or whatever and haven't checked out a lot of

1049
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:19,860
old PC

1050
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:23,740
gaming titles that are just fabulous. Civilization, definitely check that out

1051
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:28,060
and Railroad Tycoon is great. Oh, this game looks very pretty, that's cool.

1052
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:31,380
I hope it's easy to get into though. The problem with a lot of these

1053
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:34,860
PC sim type of games is that the learning curve is way too high.

1054
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:38,780
but hopefully uh... you know this will be easy to get into and civilization

1055
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:41,800
at least the original one had a pretty good learning curve on its own

1056
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:44,100
sift two and three were pretty good too, so I have faith

1057
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:48,380
that this will be good. It's looking pretty awesome so far. I mean I probably wouldn't be too

1058
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:50,220
into playing it but it looks pretty cool.

1059
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:53,420
Alright, and comment from our chat room SSJ100Matt

1060
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:58,260
this game is gonna railroad the competition waka waka waka. Har har har.

1061
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:00,260
Oh, you win.

1062
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:03,540
Alright, let's get into our last story of the night which is going to be brought

1063
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:04,620
to us by

1064
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:05,860
Loki

1065
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:07,000
okay

1066
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,740
were some crazy things people do to get an xbox three sixty

1067
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:14,460
one of them is to memorize pie

1068
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:18,840
that's right like apple cherry no pie is in

1069
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,620
the number pie

1070
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:25,420
a happy belated pie day to our listeners cause you know march fourteenth just

1071
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:27,980
passed you know it's pie day

1072
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:29,260
anyways

1073
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:30,460
uh... mole

1074
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:38,060
This 15-year-old student from Salem, Virginia, recited 8,784 digits of Pi from memory on

1075
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:39,060
Tuesday.

1076
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:44,180
His father promised to buy him an Xbox 360 if he succeeded his own personal goal, which

1077
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:47,540
was 10,790.

1078
01:05:47,540 --> 01:05:55,220
He was actually trying to set the world record, which was, I think, previously 10,700, so

1079
01:05:55,220 --> 01:06:02,220
he wanted to cut. Or actually no, I'm sorry, 10,625 set in 1978 by David Foria. However

1080
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:09,940
though, his dad teased him and saying because he did not reach his goal of 10,790, he would

1081
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:19,220
get an Xbox 360, but no game. Yeah, he only gets a core. So he can't even download something

1082
01:06:19,220 --> 01:06:22,340
and download something off Xbox Live Arcade, he just gets a core.

1083
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:27,900
Ironically enough, 10,790, that's how many systems that were actually sold in Japan.

1084
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:30,460
Stop it.

1085
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:31,460
You know what, though?

1086
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:35,260
In the time it took him to learn to memorize that, the kid could have gone out and gotten

1087
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:38,420
a job and gotten the money to buy this Xbox 360, don't you think?

1088
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:39,420
Well, I guess it was.

1089
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:40,740
He was 15, maybe he can't work and everything.

1090
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:43,580
You can get a work permit at that age, can't you?

1091
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:44,580
Hell yeah.

1092
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:46,420
Yeah, so get a job!

1093
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:50,740
well then again though different states different you know that's true

1094
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:54,300
that's labor laws so whatever floats your boat I guess if that's how you want

1095
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:55,380
to make money go for it

1096
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:58,580
all right well this is something that I've

1097
01:06:58,580 --> 01:07:01,980
mentioned to you off the air before

1098
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:05,980
there's going to be an announcement next week about

1099
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:09,180
us and

1100
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:12,300
Fanime

1101
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:16,900
I'm excited about this huh and pie and no nope well maybe we'll bring pie

1102
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:21,460
to Fauna Mae. We'll see. Do you want to promise Punch and Pie?

1103
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:25,660
I think people should bring us pie. We do this show for free. I want you to bring me pie.

1104
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:31,620
I'm not gonna bake pies. But maybe Dark Sockrel will bake some pies since after

1105
01:07:31,620 --> 01:07:32,700
all the

1106
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:36,700
emails do say you should be in the kitchen. No. I'll bake

1107
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:41,580
arsenic pie. Sounds like fun. I might go down for a day.

1108
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:45,300
I'll check it out. We'll see. Alright, anyway,

1109
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:48,860
that's going to about wrap it up for tonight's program. And ribbons and bows.

1110
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:52,420
A few quick programming notes for you guys, for those of you that listen to Orange

1111
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:53,980
Lounge Radio 24-7.

1112
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:57,180
Just so you know, Pump Up the Volume will not be heard this week.

1113
01:07:57,180 --> 01:08:02,140
Because of Comcast. That's right. However, I did get the ultimate geek as my tech,

1114
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:06,660
and he was awesome. That's cool. And then the guy who came to... He might be listening to this show tonight, who knows?

1115
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:10,940
I actually did, well, I wouldn't say he's like a geek geek, but he's into the same type of cool,

1116
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:15,420
He likes Monty Python and George Romero.

1117
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:17,860
So he was really awesome if you were listening.

1118
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:21,380
I totally forgot what your name was, because I actually do

1119
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:24,020
want to send a compliment to your boss.

1120
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:25,900
So if you are listening, email me at

1121
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:27,720
jamieatorangejonesradio.com.

1122
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:29,060
I will totally write a letter of

1123
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:30,300
commendation to your boss.

1124
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:32,980
But also, he needs to fix your line.

1125
01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:33,660
It's not him.

1126
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:35,220
We found out what it is.

1127
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:38,100
In fact, the tech who came over, the first thing he did

1128
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:40,020
was go in and pet Shermie.

1129
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:41,420
I was like, you're cool.

1130
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:44,720
So I've had nothing but good from Comcast lately, even though my service hasn't been great.

1131
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:47,960
When Loki and I lived together, we had a tech come over to the place that we were

1132
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:50,880
living at, and the guy walked into the room and saw the arcade machine that

1133
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,160
Loki had built and was like,

1134
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:56,300
what do you guys do here? Dude, I still get stuff. I get, you know, people

1135
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:59,920
like, I order pizza these days, and he's like, didn't you used to live on- yeah.

1136
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:04,380
Cause I recognize the arcade cabinet.

1137
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:07,860
That's great. I remember when you guys were building that.

1138
01:09:07,860 --> 01:09:08,860
That's pretty cool.

1139
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:09,860
All right.

1140
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:14,020
But, um, but I would like to say, what happened is that in my neighborhood, um, someone cut

1141
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:19,100
the head line of a fiber optic cable, cost them $10,000 to repair it.

1142
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:20,100
What a bunch of jerks.

1143
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:23,060
And yeah, and so we were all out of service and what's happening is that while they're

1144
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:27,240
affecting the repairs and putting everything back together, we've been having really erratic

1145
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:28,240
service.

1146
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:30,320
So I've been told to give it a week for it to clear up.

1147
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:34,220
So as a result, so that you guys don't have to put up with the crap that happened last

1148
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:36,740
week, I am not doing a show this Tuesday.

1149
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:38,220
I will be back the next week.

1150
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:41,420
Alright, but I will be on Wednesday night with the Rob Roberts show for some music and

1151
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:43,120
some geek chat and stuff.

1152
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:48,340
And you know, whatever else comes up, we'll let you know about it on orangelaundraider.com.

1153
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:53,340
For now, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts, starting off with Loki.

1154
01:09:53,340 --> 01:09:58,480
My bad, I completely forgot something I wanted to talk about and I'll make it really quick.

1155
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:03,540
We have to talk about this, DDR Supernova, it was at the ASI event that was going on

1156
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:05,980
and there was some new stuff.

1157
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:11,580
One thing, of course, Betson, the manufacturer of this, said no upgrade units will be available.

1158
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:15,380
It's all new hardware, you can buy it straight, you know.

1159
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:20,900
They did show videos that were recorded at the event of the new songs, including Healing

1160
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:24,260
Division and also Chaos.

1161
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:31,940
Chaos which has 4 goddamn billion tempo changes and stops in it, including 164th stops.

1162
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:38,440
So it's absolutely insane and retarded, but it should be fun for people that want to challenge.

1163
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:44,580
Also they showed a little bit of the battle mode, which is just like dance magic mode.

1164
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:45,580
Loki got refuted.

1165
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:46,580
Oh.

1166
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:47,580
By Legend of Zaku.

1167
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:49,580
It just says it's not true at this time.

1168
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:50,580
Ah.

1169
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:51,580
Oh snap.

1170
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:59,420
Alright, my final thought is my ears need to pop, so I'm gonna go chew gum.

1171
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:00,420
I'm sure you wanted to know that.

1172
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:02,980
Dark Soccer, your final thought?

1173
01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:07,280
I have very conflicting emotions toward Comcast right now.

1174
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:08,280
And reject false icons.

1175
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:09,280
All right.

1176
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:10,280
Guitar Vader!

1177
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:15,120
