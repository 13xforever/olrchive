Tonight, March 5th, 2006, a unique look at Destination PlayStation.
Japan votes on its top 100 games of all time, and we give our opinion on the results.
And Bobby Blackwolf from AllGames.com joins us to talk about what's new on their website this week.
It feels so good to be back.
You don't even know.
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio episode number 175 for this March the 5th of 2006.
Our first show back after a little bit of a vacation there.
DarkSakura and I had plans that took us out of town.
Real life gets in the way of independent podcasting sometimes so we took a little time off.
Loki, lovely job filling in there the past couple weeks with little, just short shows, just, it's a little bit of crack, just to hold you over, though, so we appreciate that.
Of course.
And just so you guys know, that wasn't the original plan.
The original plan is that DarkSakura, myself, and Loki were all gonna do one show, but DarkSakura was having, like, mic issues or something at her house.
And I was broke, and couldn't buy anyone.
I made do with my headset mic on pump.
I was just waiting for some witty retort.
I bought an iBook and the plan was to do a podcast for my brand new iBook.
I was going to do that.
That didn't work out too well, did it?
No, no, no.
It's not the iBook's fault.
I love my iBook.
I really do.
I'm sorry, Loki.
The whole Mac thing.
I'm totally on Jamie's side now.
I love the iBook.
It's great.
I mean, I'm...
When it comes to computers, I still consider myself bi.
I love PC.
Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't.
Some days I want a PC, some days I want a Mac.
But I really have appreciated what both have to offer there.
So I got an iBook.
And I wasn't able to do the podcasting on it.
And that was mostly because you go out when you go travel for a long time.
You go out with a certain plan and you don't always necessarily...
Get everything done that you originally intended to do.
Like, I just got too busy.
In other words, I just got too busy to take the time to set it all up.
Didn't you try using, like, the mic that's actually part of it?
There's actually a mic that's built in, but it wasn't good enough.
Exactly.
It sounded like I was talking out of a Dixie cup.
I mean, it would work for Skype or something, but it would not work for trying to do a professional sounding show as we try to fake once in a while.
Oh, by the way, hello.
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
I'm Rob Roberts, also known as Sky, your coughing host here, who just had some water go down the wrong pipe.
You know how that goes.
Joining me, as always, say hello to the lovely DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
I am caffeine-free for the third day in a row.
Congratulations.
Shoot me!
Speaking of getting off the crack or whatever... I'm freaking going through withdrawal like such a crack addict.
Are you getting bad headaches?
Because when I did the caffeine thing, and believe me, I went back, I got really bad headaches.
Okay, Thursday, my friend Julie brought chocolate-covered espresso beans to work and I ate 15.
And then we went to do gaming that night.
Tabletop gaming, you know, where you roll dice and not, you know, use your controller.
Yeah.
And nobody else showed up and I ate... You roll a D20.
I ate... No, actually we used D6s.
Oh, sorry.
No, no, we used D10s.
It's Buffy.
Alright, nerd.
Anyway, I ate like 10 more.
And then I was like, okay.
And I was bouncing.
Yeah, how's that no caffeine thing going?
And so Friday I was like, you know what?
No caffeine.
I've been drinking kombucha tea.
Sounds dirty.
It's made out of, it's a fermented tea made with mushrooms and sweet tea.
And it tastes like apple cider vinegar.
All right.
But it's been keeping me healthy and keeping the withdrawal symptoms down.
And I had decaf coffee.
So for all those people who have emailed concerned about your health, these are the actions you're taking to combat that.
I am so proud of myself.
I had a sinus infection last week.
And I did not... Okay, shut up.
Sorry, I'm not laughing at you.
I'm just...
Okay, I'm laughing for a real rude reason, but I mean, it's just, it's crazy.
I did not go to the doctor.
I did not let them put me on any drugs.
I drank hot tea all week.
And as a result, I am feeling fabulous tonight.
Good.
Because I am fully from here on, unless I break something, not going to the doctor ever again for an illness, unless I have cancer or a brain tumor.
Let's hope that doesn't happen.
We do have video games to talk about.
In case you haven't listened to Orange Lounge Radio before, we don't usually bitch so much about a personalized, but we've been gone for two weeks, so we have a lot to catch up on.
We'll get to games very shortly.
Say hello, of course, to Loki.
No Orange Lounge would be complete without Loki.
I do feel sick today.
Do you?
Here's the reason why I feel sick.
Basically, I went to the movies today and I saw Ultraviolet, but then I ate a whole bag of popcorn.
And then afterwards I went to Applebee's and I had fish and chips with their honey pepper sauce.
And then I was slamming down Pepsis all day long and playing Xbox Live.
And to the point where I was playing Xbox Live and either with the adrenaline of playing Full Auto and Pepsi's, you know, the caffeine, I was literally shaking like I had the chills.
And now my stomach feels like I'm, you know, I'm sick.
But it's probably just because of all that popcorn and I haven't eaten anything since lunch.
So, uh...
But other than that, though, I've been playing a lot of Xbox Live.
I swear to God, sometimes you and Jamie are like yin and yang.
I mean, she'll have this healthy story to talk about, and you'll be like, I went to Applebee's and dined on chicken strips, or whatever it was you had.
It's just because I ate a bag of popcorn.
and, you know, a bunch of honey pepper sauce and that stuff.
It doesn't agree with me.
See, for every hoop chakra chupacabra tea or whatever, Jamie has... Chupacabra tea!
Whatever it is you have.
Loki has, you know... And of course my neck is all stiff and has been hurting for like two days, but...
Other than that, you know, it's all good.
Lots of games and fun stuff.
And I did podcasts earlier in the week, and we restarted our Grand Theft Auto stats.
So, lots and lots of fun stuff.
But yeah, Ultraviolet, for those who are wondering if the movie's good or not, it's okay, but it has really bad CG in it.
And halfway through the movie, you're like, what the hell are they trying to do?
That's about it.
So, yeah.
All right.
Well, we also have a special guest tonight.
Once in a while, we like to invite other people in the house, and we've been ignoring him for the past 10 minutes.
Very sorry to Spike.
Say hello to Spike.
I don't mind being ignored, but thank you for having me tonight.
Not a problem.
It's good to have you here.
Don't be afraid to just put that mic right there, right next to your mouth, because otherwise, they're cheap mics.
They're RadioShack mics.
They don't pick up otherwise, so...
Cheap is the best.
There you go.
So, how are you doing?
Doing fantastic.
I've been playing Trauma Center all week.
Really?
And it's addicted me the way that I thought only World of Warcraft could.
And, well, usually we kick off the show with How was your gaming week?
So, Spike, since you're kicking us off, let's do it.
Trauma Center, is it really as hard as everybody says it is?
I haven't really played it.
I have to be honest.
I haven't really played it.
But I've heard it's insanely hard.
I tried playing it on the subway and almost killed myself.
But when I sat down to it, it sucked me in like a crazy, massively multiplayer online game.
Very addictive, very innovative.
I certainly would like to see another version of it.
I just want to point out, for those asking in the chat room, this is not the same Spike on DDR Freak.
Some folks are wondering.
This is my buddy Spike.
Do you really have any credentials to be on this program?
I guess not, but that's okay.
You're a gamer.
That's all you need, right, Spike?
He's laughing.
I hate you.
No, that's all right.
Everybody does.
All right.
Well, we love having you here.
It's different, different, Spike.
You know, it's exciting news, actually, about Trauma Center.
That's one of the games that's being brought over to the revolution.
Confirmed.
How do you know this, Mr. Man?
Because there's a news story about it.
Okay.
I'm assuming we'll get into that later.
Possibly.
Anything else besides Trauma Center in your week, Spike?
Not DDR Freak Spike, but Spike?
R. Spike, OLR Spike.
A lot of World of Warcraft.
Alright.
It's pretty pathetic.
What kind of character are you in World of Warcraft?
What kind of character are you in World of Warcraft?
I just started a Tauren hunter and it's quite exciting because it's my first horde character and
It's quite difficult compared to an Alliance character.
You know what?
I thought I would hate the Horde when I first started playing Horde, but I actually kind of enjoy Horde side, I think, a little more than Alliance side.
Alliance side is a little, I don't know, it's too much like every other MMO I've played.
I immediately made an Undead.
I made my elf, and then I made an Undead.
Because I had to have the zombie thing going on.
Like Thriller?
Thriller.
No, no, no, no.
Like Romero Zombie.
All right.
Anyway, thank you very much, Spike.
Well, feel free to give your input on anything throughout the show and all that fun stuff.
And if you have anything to plug, any upcoming projects, anything you're doing, just feel free.
Get it out there.
I hear you're a very good DJ.
You do DJ stuff, right?
Yes, I do.
Not like podcasting type of DJ stuff, but like spinning, mixing?
I go to clubs.
Right now, the iPod thing is a big deal, but I still say vinyl is the way to go.
There you go.
You're just a purist.
Nothing wrong with that.
Alright, let's go over to DarkSakura.
How was your gaming week?
Well, my series of gaming weeks, I did play a lot of Animal Crossing and some Pupalo Cross.
Although, I had to start over because I was on... No, actually I didn't.
I was going to start over on your PSP and then I realized that it was going to be on your memory card and I'm too lazy to move it.
So I just watched Hellboy.
and Kill Bill on the plane going to Alabama.
That's right.
Somebody borrowed my PSP while I was gone.
But that's okay.
She had my permission.
It got love.
That's good.
Because it wasn't getting any at this house.
I put it in a case and I cleaned the screen.
Because, look, let me put it this way.
The last time I played that was when Luminous was still a new game.
Okay?
Let's just put it that way.
That PSP.
Oh, no.
And I checked out OLR PSP on it.
That's it.
Otherwise, that PSP is not really doing it for me.
Sorry.
Sorry, PSP fans.
I'm just not feeling the love with the offerings that are out yet.
But Power Stone is coming to the PSP.
That is true.
That is so awesome.
I love Power Stone.
There's a lot of sexy shit coming out for the PSP, so I'm glad Jamie cleaned it so that it's ready to go for me when I get it back and can play the, you know, I want to play that Mega Man stuff and the...
Katamari Namashi, PSP.
It's going to be a good year for PSP.
So PSP fans, you can just stop writing those angry emails right now.
It'll be fine.
I'll rediscover my love for PSP.
Just wait.
Well, we've also, Dan's been playing Phoenix Wright like all the damn time.
So I've gotten to see like the fourth trial, the whole thing, because he kept making me watch it.
It was pretty cool, but I sort of don't need to play now because I know how it goes.
Between him and Roz spoiling it for me, I'm eventually going to play it, but I can just watch everybody else play it.
I think Dan finally beat Need for Speed Underground, so that was pretty cool.
He's been just...
Watch a lot of Simpsons
Yes, the replacement came about, not that long after I said, I think it took about two business days and I had it back.
So it came back pretty quick, but of course I wasn't here to enjoy it.
It's just, you know, Extifer, my roommate, told me it was here.
So when I got back from the trip, I played Xbox 360.
That's like a lot of what I've been doing this weekend.
And I saw Your Husband's High Score on Smash TV, because that's one of the games I checked out, Smash TV.
I've been playing like hell a lot of the stuff on the Xbox Live Arcade.
Crystal Quest, because I remember that game on the Mac from years ago.
Pretty cool reinterpretation.
Somebody said on our forums that the achievement points were really easy in that game, and I have to agree.
You want like 50 easy achievement points?
There you go.
I wasn't able to get good achievement points on that.
All you have to do, don't use a smart bomb and get all the way to level 30.
That's like 30 points right there for getting that far.
Anyway.
So there's that, and then what else did I play on there?
A little bit of Geometry Wars still, although I haven't gotten much better at that.
And I bought Full Auto, just because of all the good things I heard about it.
Not from critics, because a lot of critics have bashed it, but from word of mouth, a lot of people have been saying good things about Full Auto.
So I picked it up.
I have to say I'm enjoying it.
I haven't gotten to play a whole lot, but I like it so far.
It's racing with guns, which is never a bad thing.
Wait till you get to the end of the game.
Probably if you listened to last week's podcast, you would have heard me yelling and screaming about the game and saying, God damn it, I fucking hate this end part of the game.
The rewind feature is awesome.
I love that.
Like, if I screw up, I can just rewind time.
It's awesome.
More games need that.
Mario Kart needs that, especially online, because I screw up too much when I play online.
or when people disconnect, I'll just rewind so that they didn't actually disconnect.
Speaking of DS, I also picked up, this is a game I was so looking forward to, very excited about, Super Princess Peach on the DS.
I don't know.
I don't know if I'm really thrilled with this game.
It just wasn't what I expected.
And maybe that's my own damn fault because I didn't really read up on this game.
I just assumed, oh, it will be like Mario Brothers, but it will be Princess Peach.
Because I heard that Nintendo is trying to get back to their roots, especially with the new Mario DS games coming out.
I assumed that Princess Peach would be like, you know, it would be like, oh, it's like Mario 2, but on the DS.
Whoa, was I wrong.
Because...
This is kind of funny because the whole concept behind the game is that Princess Peach is totally emotionally unstable, like most women I know.
Just kidding.
You need to be quiet, Mr. Rob.
I'm kidding.
But seriously, the whole concept of the game is that Princess Peach is emotionally unstable, and you can set things on fire with her anger.
You can make the grass grow with her tears.
You can make her life regenerate with her calmness or acid trip.
I don't know what mood that's supposed to be.
The Power of Prozac
Peach doesn't feel like the same character that she is in the other Mario games and in Mario Party.
And I realize maybe part of this is to obviously make Peach the hero for once.
But if you've ever played Mario Party against me, you'll know that Peach is always the hero of Mario Party because I always play Peach and I always win.
I seem to have a memory of beating you before, sir.
Whatever.
Peach is always...
I played full auto.
I finished the game 100%.
I'm just getting the last few achievements online.
I've gotten...
I'm up on to rank 3 now online, because for some reason it's not counting all the ranked races I'm doing.
I raced about 6 different races today, and it only counted 2 of them, which ironically enough were the best ones I did, so that worked out in my favor.
But still though, I spent all that time to play people and they freaking drop like mad.
It's crazy.
It's like Mario Kart but worse.
It's still really fun though.
And you get to play in some of the races.
I found my strategy though is the same during the multiplayer games as in my single player games where I drop a lot of bombs behind me and just get ahead of the pack and I just take people out as I'm driving.
And it worked really well.
I got in the first place that way.
But the game is really fun.
Really frustrating in the gang war section of the game, but I finally got gold on those.
And once I was done with that, I was like, finally.
Really rewarding.
Other than that, I've been trying to get into some more of the Xbox Live Arcade games.
Played a little bit more Hexic HD.
Trying to actually become good at that game, but I can't.
And tried Gauntlet and suck at Gauntlet still.
Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter
All right.
Speaking of gauntlets, since you brought up gauntlet in there, I'm going to go to our chat room now.
Finally.
Sorry, chat room.
I'm not ignoring you guys.
I know you're there.
www.orangelantrader.com.
Click on chat.
I'm not.
Don't just.
Lies.
Spitting lies.
Emotionally unstable woman.
All right.
I am not unstable.
Who touched the fire heart?
Who touched it?
I'm just teasing.
Alright, moving on.
Let's see.
Oh, question from chatroom.
Hitstun says, does Gauntlet have online play?
Yes.
Yes, and that is pretty much what makes pretty much...
It is what mucho makes these games worthwhile on Xbox Live.
Otherwise, I would say, frickin' go get Midway Arcade Classics.
It's got every single game they're offering on Live.
But the online play is what makes these worth the five bucks a pop.
It's sometimes hard to find an opponent, but it's fun.
And that's the only way that Gauntlet remains fun after the first few levels for me, honestly, is to have four people playing it.
So...
Definitely, you know, if you're wanting to get back into Gauntlet, check it out on Xbox Live because you can do the co-op thing.
So, pretty exciting.
If you guys want to participate, www.orangelonestradio.com Click on chat.
And of course, you guys are always free to disagree with us.
DMN says, I disagree with your opinion on Peach Sky.
Well, that's... And you know what?
My opinion might change.
I've changed my opinion on games when I go back and play them for a longer time.
As I'm sure some of you guys have done as well.
Sometimes, like a CD, a movie, you watch it, listen to it the first time, and you think, this sucks.
And you go back later, and it's actually really good.
Same thing happens with games all the time.
So, you know, I reserve the right to change my opinion.
Nothing is ever cemented.
But, I don't know.
I don't...
I can't see my opinion changing on this, but we'll see.
We'll see.
I have to say something about Katsukan, which is where I went part of my trip, where I was at.
I did a panel there on Bomani Games.
I was placed Sunday at 11 a.m.
I could count on my hands how many people showed up to my panel, and that made me kind of sad.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Oh well, maybe next time.
We are thinking about going to other cons and stuff, so if you have suggestions, we can't go to everything, but if you, you know, especially California-based stuff, we can certainly try and make an attempt at going to, and I know we've got ideas of our own, so we'll see what happens.
Big thanks to those of you guys who did stop by and say hi at KatsuCon.
Also, a big, huge thank you to the listener who hooked me up with a Wonderswan color.
That was so awesome.
Did I tell you about that?
I got a Wonderswan color.
That's really cool.
And Final Fantasy IV.
That's so badass.
I love the Wonderswan color.
And you already know I love Final Fantasy IV.
I don't have to tell you again.
Alright, anyway.
Moving on.
Let's get into this week's news.
Starting off with Loki.
Loki...
You've got the hookup or something this week, don't you?
Loki, what's up?
Destination PlayStation.
This is a retail-only event.
That means no press.
But, being that I work in retail...
We did get the hookup.
I actually got the PowerPoint presentations of a few different companies that were going to be there showing off their games.
And we got a bunch of different titles.
As I mentioned last week, we did have some stuff regarding the Activision.
And now I have the Vividi Universal titles that are going to be coming out.
This year!
And a lot of this stuff hasn't been announced yet, so it's going to be kind of cool.
Including some of the Revolution games that are going to be coming out at launch.
But let me just run down the list here of some of the really cool stuff.
Just so you guys know, he's actually, and I know this is radio, so he's actually looking at a PowerPoint that I'm sure is not supposed to be looked at by us right now, but it shows, it's a freaking calendar that just shows, it looks very official, boys and girls, I...
This is great.
This is so cool.
Anyways, this is the exact PowerPoint that they're showing at Destination PlayStation, which is awesome.
But starting off here, well, upcoming this second quarter, we've got Over the Hedge and X-Men 3, which is no surprise, two games based on upcoming movies.
In July through September, third quarter,
We've got the movies X-Pack, which is coming out for the PC and expansion to the movies.
Now wait, I noticed something here.
Okay, take X3, for example.
I see it's bolded, and then I see the legend at the bottom says, Bold, Xbox 360, PS3, and or Nintendo, I guess NR means Nintendo Revolution.
So when it's bolded in April, May, June, is that like hinting, or is that just going to be Xbox 360?
It means that there's probably an Xbox 360 version for X-Men 3.
I see, because I get, look at that goat.
Does that mean we're going to have like a PS3?
No, no, no.
I didn't think so.
July, or quarter three, we've got, like I said, the movies X-Pac for the PC, Quake Enemy Territory for the PC, as well as a couple budget titles.
They have Kabbalah's Alaskan Adventures for both consoles and PC.
And let's see here, also for quarter four, of course, is going to be the biggest stuff.
And I see lots of bolded stuff here.
Lots of bold stuff.
So this must mean the other consoles, they're expecting them to be out this time.
Well, here's where we're going here.
We've got actual launch stuff.
Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam
Call of Duty 3 is going to be another title that's coming out on the PlayStation 3 and for the 360, which is going to be pretty cool.
Call of Duty, also, they're going to be getting a version for the PSP.
as well as Gun is coming to the PSP.
These are the bargain titles here.
The History Channel presents the Civil War, a first person shooter I might add.
So, I don't know exactly how that would work, because I know it takes a long-ass time to reload.
Civil War first-person shooter?
This shit's fake.
This has got to be fake.
No, that is not fake.
It's better than World War II.
Let me tell you a switch.
It was supposed to come out last year.
I have the sell sheets for this.
It looks like the biggest piece of crap I've ever seen, but it's a budget title.
It's weird.
It's really bad.
Harley Davidson, they're also doing another bike game.
I mean, come on.
They had American Choppers, the game.
So, of course, this one really got me laughing.
Pimp My Ride, the game.
Kill me.
Which, you know, I thought L.A.
Rush was Pimp My Ride, the game, but whatever.
That's coming out on consoles.
And Kabbalah's African Safari.
And, you know, sadly enough, people buy those Kabbalah's games a lot.
and some other games I should mention for the DS Spider-Man Kids.
I don't know what the hell that is.
A lot of really bad games.
That's everything for Civil War First Pursuiter.
You kind of have my interest now.
It sounds like one of those you-gotta-see-it-to-believe-it type things.
I can't be the only one who's interested in a very showgirls kind of way.
Now for Vividi Universal, we've got 50 Cent.
50 Cent's coming out on the PSP in fourth quarter.
Because a year later, the game's still going to suck.
Crash Festival, a Crash Bandicoot game for the DS, will be coming out also in fourth quarter.
I wonder whatever happened to Crash Bandicoot.
They still make games for that stuff.
I don't know.
You know the last one I ever played of Crash Bandicoot was the little party game they had on the PlayStation.
Crash Bash?
Yeah, Crash Bash.
What a crap.
What a crap that game was.
I'm sorry.
That was like the worst knockoff game I'd ever seen in my life.
I've got a game coming out called Eragon, which is going to be based on a movie that's coming out around the same time, quarter four.
Also on the 360 and all the console systems.
Actually, it's pretty sweet.
They've got John Malkovich in it.
It looks like he plays like a
A Troll or something.
I don't know.
That's kind of neat.
But it's definitely going to be a lot better than In the Name of the King and Uebo Crap Fest.
Let's see.
Of course, a bunch of other movie tie-ins here.
Miami Vice, of course, with the movie that's coming out.
Also a console game.
Moving on.
Scarface coming out in September.
That one actually looks pretty sweet because it's kind of, you know, it's like Vice City but actually, you know, without ripping off Scarface.
Spyro Deluxe
or Legend of Spyro A New Beginning.
And that's coming out in all the systems in October, actually.
See, I always thought Crash and Spyro ran away together to the land of oversaturation and made like a million babies or something.
Yeah, I don't know.
And then there's another crappy game here called Mach, which is for the PSP.
And it looks like crap.
Unless you like airplane fighting.
If you like airplane combat games.
Boom, boom, shoot them up, top gun.
But, uh...
Oh, and I forgot, I had EA's lineup too.
Just real quick, though.
There's only a couple that are worth mentioning.
They're anytime soon.
Superman Returns, coming out in June.
June 26th, currently.
Will it be based on the Superman 64 engine?
No, it will not be.
Actually, you know what?
I have seen the video for this.
They released a trailer for it, and it actually looks really good.
It's going to have 80 square miles of metropolis you get to fly around in.
and with all the buildings and everything and um really cool and they've got Metallo in there giant you know robot you get to fight and stuff and I don't know and then Lord of the Rings Battle for Middle Earth 2 um for Xbox 360 tentatively right now for June 13th speaking of the land of oversaturation now now sorry I've been gone for a couple weeks I'm a little feisty tonight that's all we got so far I'm still waiting to get back from uh
Because a lot of people right now, Destination PlayStation was taking place this week and a lot of people are still busy.
I'll get some more info later on.
You know, DarkTetsuya has an interesting point about the Civil War first person shooter.
If that is historically accurate, then you will be spending more time reloading than firing.
Exactly.
Do you remember seeing this in history class to put the powder back in the gun forever and all that stuff?
Make for some mean online play.
Think about that.
You have a 15 minute match, you can only fire 15 shots.
Better make those count.
Moving on, I noticed when I was gone, people got really freaked out about this Microsoft origami.
Like, you know, oh!
Here it is.
Microsoft's entering the handheld market.
Here it is.
The origami is their answer to the PSP and the DS, right?
Here's my thing, okay?
About the origami.
The origami is a stupid name.
I'm sorry.
Because it makes me want to fold it.
And you don't do that.
You don't fold a Microsoft equipment.
Here's the thing about the origami, though.
It reminds me of, like,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I can't stick it in a pocket unless I'm like 5 billion pounds and have pants the size of, you know.
A parachute or something.
The Microsoft doorstop.
Now with Halo.
By the way, it doesn't play Halo.
Here it is, kids.
Here it is.
Now the word's coming out that it is not actually their answer to the PSP or DS.
So sit down.
Because what this is, is actually it is their first in a line of paperback-sized computers.
So what the hell was the Halo thing?
It was running Halo on Windows XP, is what they say.
Because it's like a portable computer.
Paperback size?
Okay, I know what the size of a paperback book is.
If this thing is like the paperback size of a phone book.
Apparently the paperback in question is War and Peace.
Apparently.
I don't know.
The Bible.
With the Book of Mormon as the AC adapter or something.
No, it's the size of the unabridged dictionary.
Anyway, all kidding aside, Microsoft's going to have this tiny, and I use that term very loosely, tiny computer coming out soon called the Origami.
But you know...
People are saying it's not a handheld, but correct me if I'm wrong, if the damn thing hooks up to all of Microsoft's other stuff, couldn't you theoretically get some perks as an origami owner, such as maybe Xbox 360 demos, movies on your origami?
Couldn't that still be something that's an option?
Oh, of course, you earn the ridicule of all your friends.
This made me laugh.
Okay, Game Informer is trying to guess what you could use the origami for, and one of the things they said is a secondary screen for your 360.
I'm like, yeah, I'm going to go out there and spend $500 on a crappy little screen that could possibly be used in a game as a status screen or something like a DS.
No.
I'll tell you what the origami can be used for.
Ah, shit, I got a crooked nail.
You killed the penguin.
People out in the living room are probably going, what the hell are they doing on that show tonight?
Well, you know what?
If someone could be bludgeoned to death with an iPod, man, that origami is giving me some deadly stuff there.
Well, you know, since you pissed off enough Mac users, we'll get the hate mail from Microsoft fans this week.
It's just, you know, turnabout's fair play.
DarkSakura, World of Warcraft
In addition to, what's the other three languages they have out in Europe right now?
Yeah.
So, uh, we get the Spanish version!
El Computer Es En Fuego.
Lucha Libre on Telemundo
Loki, you also have a WoW story.
Yes, this is how you can become part of the beta for the World of Warcraft Burning Crusade.
And no, that's not an STD.
They have three different things that are going to be going on.
The first is a race to level 50 contest.
And that's basically just like it sounds.
You take a new character and see how quickly you can get to level 50.
And hopefully the top 1,000 will secure the right to be able to be part of the beta.
The second competition is called the Battle for Warsong Gulch.
It's basically a level 19 capped battle.
The top 500 players for that are going to be able to be part of the beta for that.
Finally, the most level 25 characters contest.
Just like it sounds, the top 1,000 people who can get the most characters that are level 25 and above
Get to also be part of the beta
I just found a reason to take my vacation time.
I'm happy.
Nerd.
Alright, moving on.
I also have a WoW story.
You know how the rumors are going around that World of Warcraft is going to come out on the Xbox 360?
Not.
Not.
So even though Squeenix is bringing over Final Fantasy XI to the 360, MCV, the Interactive Entertainment Weekly, is saying that the Blizzard Chief Operating Officer, Paul Sam, said, "...we do not have any plans to take WoW to Xbox 360.
WoW is built as a PC gaming experience.
Porting PC games to console often compromises games, and we would never allow the WoW gameplay experience to suffer."
So, it doesn't sound like it's going to happen.
To counter that, according to the VOIP blog, World of Warcraft is indeed going to debut on the 360.
This is, of course, coming about a day after they announced that it wasn't, and apparently the whole thing is they're going to announce some sort of secret partnership at E3.
Of course, that sounds like a bunch of fan-based speculation to me.
With all due respect to that blog in question, blog...
Chief Operating Officer of Blizzard.
It's hard to say which one's more believable.
But you know, it's not like these guys haven't lied before.
To the blog's credit, they could totally make a 180 on this statement and we would just look like asses again.
Moving on.
New story.
Loki.
We were talking about Gauntlet on Xbox Live Arcade.
The fun ain't done yet, right?
Of course not.
There's going to be some more Midway games coming to the Xbox Live Arcade.
One of my favorites.
Paperboy.
Paperboy is coming.
Of course.
And Roopier Tapper.
That's going to be really good.
Dude, I own it, that game.
It's on.
But Rupert Tapper's not really two-player.
It's not two-player co-op.
So I don't think they're going to have to get creative with that one to make that a worthwhile purchase.
Same thing with Paperboy.
They weren't really, you know, the enticing thing about the Midway games is that they're co-op and stuff, but those games aren't really multiplayer at once.
Defender is also coming.
Some other stuff that will be heading our way is going to be Cyberball.
Some sort of robot football game.
And then finally, of course, the best one.
Mortal Kombat 3, or Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, is going to be coming.
To combat, of course, Street Fighter 2.
Why Mortal Kombat 3?
Which I would say is the worst one in the entire series.
Sorry, I even prefer Mortal Kombat 4 over Mortal Kombat 3.
Mortal Kombat 2 is the top of the series.
I know, Mortal Kombat 2 is the top.
I don't think there's any dispute in that.
But I even prefer, and I know people totally disagree, I prefer Mortal Kombat 4 to 3.
I did not like 3 at all.
It just...
The beta versions of Mortal Kombat 2 Mortal Kombat 2 is awesome Why 3?
Why are they coming out with 3?
Why not 2?
People want 2 I don't know Be glad you're getting any Mortal Kombat I'm not spending $5 on Mortal Kombat 3 Especially when I already have Arcade Legends 2 Who says it's going to be $5?
Watch when Street Fighter 2 comes out I bet you it'll probably be like $10 F that Pretty soon you'll be paying for $40 games online
Moving on.
DarkSakura has a story about parents and video games and all that fun stuff.
What's up?
Parents and video games.
Well, video games' worst enemy is lazy parents.
How many times have I said this?
I know, I'm kind of like...
Even when I was looking over this week's story, I was kind of like, this is news.
But it's nice to see that the media is kind of acknowledging that it's not always doom and gloom, the gamer's fault.
Everybody is equally to blame sometimes.
I don't know.
Well, there's this...
legislation going into actually and this is actually something else I was reading on a number of sites there's actually new legislation to have the game ratings redone which is actually pretty stupid a lot of people are protesting it
Well, I think it's okay if they want to do it like we've suggested on this program before, and I think it's the way they do it in the UK, if I'm not mistaken.
That's what I'm talking about in the UK.
Oh, oh.
Oh, in the UK it's fine.
Doesn't it mirror the movies in the UK?
It does, but there's one of the Labour Party folks is lobbying to change it.
Why would you change it when I think that's the way that makes the most sense, is to mirror the movies?
Because people understand movie ratings.
They don't understand, for whatever reason, they don't understand game ratings, but they understand PG-13 ratings.
Okay, R, might have titties, don't take the kids.
Well, now they're having this mom's army business over there.
Mom as in mother.
With what little I know of British culture, I do know that one.
I'm just teasing.
Well, not everyone does.
But they're saying that the games are responsible for all kinds of social problems like drug and alcohol abuse, gang membership, and...
Gangsta Rap.
Dude, I'm going to play some Katamari Damashio.
But seriously, there was, there's actually an interesting comment on here that's a political movement launched by the same people who show a story of a woman crippled by 40 to 60 orgasms a day.
How can that be credible?
It's kind of awesome.
That's like reading The Sun or something, you know, or like The Inquirer.
Alright, well.
But they're saying that video games which, to quote, glorify pimping, drug dealing, and street murders, but they don't make a logical connection to trying to control what their children are playing.
Basically, they're blaming the games, not blaming themselves for taking responsibility for what their children are doing.
Excuse me!
We've been doing this show for four years, and didn't I say that from like, well, not quite day one, but sort of around, you know, the first year I started my whole campaign against parents doing their freaking job?
That's what makes this news, is that finally, you know, there's, you know, anyway.
It's ridiculous.
It really is ridiculous.
And honestly, I feel like writing them and going, why don't you just try parenting your children?
Moving on.
Now, on the flip side, we have a good piece about parenting and stuff later.
So please, if you're going to send hate mail right now, wait, because we have another story coming up later.
I've fully gone on and said, for those of you parents who are taking an active part in your children, it's a partnership.
They have a responsibility to put the information out there and market it correctly, but the parents have the responsibility to take that information and use it wisely.
There you go.
Something that may not be so wise.
I caught this.
It's a little piece on Kotaku this week.
Little, little piece.
And that's about all the N-Gage deserves.
In fact, I thought the N-Gage was dead and gone, but no.
Civilization just recently came out on the N-Gage this week.
And I seem to remember playing this at E3 last year.
I got so frustrated.
Civilization is probably my favorite computer game of all time.
And granted, I think this one's based off of Civ 2, the Civ 2 engine.
I got frustrated after like two minutes.
I couldn't, I could not stand.
I was like, what happened to my game?
What, why?
Why, God, why?
I was like crying in the middle of the engage booth.
I had to be removed.
But anyway, if you're a Civ fan and you happen to own an N-Gage, or you need a reason to, you know, keep your N-Gage, or need something on your... I guess, here it is, Civilization, finally out.
Enjoy, and then, you know, kick your N-Gage, because it's, you know, not that great.
Moving on, Loki!
Yes.
Interesting story, actually, coming out about the Sims.
and basically EA and Depeche Mode have collaborated on a signature song for Sims 2, open for business.
And it's actually funny because this song playing, or I guess the first ever Simlish language song, Suffer Well, a popular track by Depeche Mode, will be in the game.
And I don't know how...
How you can listen to Depeche Mode in that weird language.
That's just weird.
It's unusual.
I don't know.
That's a weird pairing to me.
Depeche Mode in The Sims.
I don't know.
It worked for the Black Eyed Peas.
Okay, Depeche Mode, Black Eyed Peas, not quite the same type of band.
It might have worked better if they had picked a good Depeche Mode song.
Yeah, I know.
But there haven't been any good Depeche Mode songs in the past 10 years.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Now my question is... The last album was really freaking good, okay?
Now my question is... Violator?
Yeah, Violator.
I'm going to hit Rob with something.
Okay, my question is, is this song for like, since this is basically the storefront Sims expansion, is this for the Hot Topic?
You know, the type of story that's going to be in the game, you know, where you get to... I don't know.
I got nothing.
Okay.
Well, I find it interesting because I remember the Black Eyed Peas did a Simlish song for the Herbs games, and I don't recall that having any great success.
I'm curious why they would try this sort of thing again.
Because Depeche Mode was like, Our last album sucks so bad!
Please, someone listen to it!
Dave, he's going to shove a mic up your butt.
I mean, it's... All right.
Let's let Jamie have a witty retort here at this time with her website of the week.
Yay, we love Jamie's website of the week.
My website of the week.
Wait, wait.
Theme music.
There we go.
I was trying to make a comment before you started that.
Oh, sorry.
Go ahead.
It's just especially significant.
Today's website of the week is the website for Warp 11 because they rock.
Warp11.com
Wow.
There's actually, I think, a song that's just about various drugs in Star Trek.
And, of course, they did the best, my favorite of their songs, they did Montalban.
Have you ever seen that old Saturday Night Live sketch with William Shatner going to the Star Trek convention and he goes, Hey, you, in the back, have you ever gotten laid?
Remember that?
Hilarious.
Sorry.
Sorry, I didn't mean to intrude on the website.
Trick fans get laid with each other.
This band is also really... I'm a closet Trekkie.
Here we go.
I will make you feel better, okay?
Because I've been pretty harsh tonight.
I'm going to give you the greatest blackmail ammo of all time.
Are you ready?
In high school, senior year, I was vice president of the Star Trek Club.
Trekkie!
There you go.
Do you feel better?
I feel somewhat better.
but um but no just like freaking go look at the on the link for music it has the lyrics to Montalban up there it's like the best lyrics ever and there's also um mp3 samples on the site which you know we should we'll play eventually I actually on my show I play a lot of warp 11 anyway because I love warp 11
and I think that off of their most recent album which is called Boldly Go Down On Me.
Welcome to Our Cube is probably my favorite song on there.
That one and Captain Caught Me on the Holodeck.
Red Alert is also a really good album just because of Seven of Mine.
It's such a really, really cool band.
I will say this and to kind of bring it back to gaming a little bit.
They're also in Trekkies too.
to bring it back to gaming a little bit I do think that Star Trek MMO is a pretty good idea I think that'll be great so we'll see when more details come out I think it'll be pretty cool one other thing I'd like to point out about the site everyone should go to the photos and look at the Halloween photos with them dressed as Star Wars characters
Alright, DarkSakura's website of the week, enjoy.
Moving on, this article's kind of been floating around the internet for a couple weeks.
Keep in mind, we haven't done a show in a couple weeks, so we have to catch up on a couple things that we missed.
But this was run on MSNBC Newsweek.
This is interesting, there's a game coming out, it's called Left Behind Eternal Forces.
Left Behind is this...
Book series of, I guess they're Christian-oriented books about what the rapture and the people to get left behind, right?
So basically what happens is that it's supposed to be taking place in Manhattan, but the level of violence is supposed to be reminiscent of Grand Theft Auto, according to this story.
It's about New Yorkers who are left behind after the rapture.
They scour the streets for converts, train...
People to be a workforce to feed, shelter, and join the resistance against the growing forces of the Antichrist is what this game is all about, which meets with a resounding okay?
Yeah, that sounds like a good title.
I know, it's just kind of like, oh really?
It sounds like GTA meets Shin Megami Tensai.
I'm almost interested.
Where's the part about getting the hooker in the car and then killing her?
I mean, where's that?
If this game does not have a sex minigame that was removed from the game but still left in the programming, I will not buy it.
Instead of hot coffee, it's hot mana.
Hopefully this game will be less boring than the movie.
And yes, I have watched the movie.
And God, I want those two hours back.
Speaking of stories that are a little bit old, but we want to bring them to your attention anyway.
Loki?
Anyways, there is a little bit of news going around.
I won't even really call this news.
The EA Sports Games for the PSP.
In order to play online, you have to do one of two things.
You have to either sign over your privacy to...
EA, and I believe ESPN to have them send you spam or pay them $2.
And so, yeah.
This has been going on and basically brought to attention again with the release of Fight Night Round 3.
But this is something that's going on since... So, what's to stop me from going to get a free Gmail account because I know thousands of people with thousands of invites to Gmail even though it's still in beta.
What's to stop me from getting a free Gmail account and having it be my spam dump ground and signing up with this address?
Listen, it's all about the principle here.
Sure, it'd be really easy to do that.
And sure, probably lots of people have done that.
And sure, even the people that have put the legitimate information haven't gotten anything sent to them.
But yeah, it's about the principle.
It's the principle of the thing.
It's like, you know, $2 or my email address.
It's like, sell your soul to the marketing.
Sell your soul to the band is essentially what they're saying.
Or buy it back for $2.
Well, the whole thing it comes down to is this isn't something that's like on the box.
You know, it's kind of to hide that in there saying, oh yeah, by the way, if you want to play online, you got to pay us $2.
You know, that's kind of not good.
Shady.
Shady.
You know what?
It's just like re-releasing games onto the 360 without really doing much other than enhancing the textures a little bit.
Yeah, we see you with Burnout, and for that, EA's going to get left behind.
Battlefield 2, Gun, and half the 360 games out there.
But really, the bigger question is,
Why are you buying these sports games anyways?
No one plays sports games out there.
Because there's a huge... Don't you know, like, some of the most successful titles over here are sports games?
We don't talk about them so much.
There's a huge audience as well.
Well, like, some of the other titles you mentioned were, like, NHL, you know, 2006.
I'm like, who plays hockey games?
I mean, really?
Hey, hockey... Hey, Blades of Steel was, like, one of my favorite NES titles ever.
So shut your mouth.
That was Nintendo.
Well, my favorite thing was, how the hell did they have a hockey game anyways when there wasn't a season in 2005?
I still like Super Baseball 3000 for the Neo Geo.
One of the best things about the Genesis was NHL, okay?
Pwned.
Oh, I'm sorry!
Pull the Canadian card on me, why don't ya?
DarkSakura, please take us to a more reasonable time.
Did I mention we're just a little off tonight?
I'm always on.
I am so on.
All right, then get us back on track with a reasonable article here.
Oh, this is something we brought up earlier, yes?
Well, this is about parenting and about video games, as in gamer parents, which I'm going to be one day.
You know, in fact, I actually wrote a nice little rant not too long ago about gamer parents playing with their children.
But there's a lovely little bit of writing out about gamer parents and about how through them actually taking an active role in the games that their children play, they're taking responsibility.
They're bringing on a new generation of gamers who have that same healthy attitude, I think.
And you know,
Instead of leaving it just as a babysitting tool, it's to balance.
That's a big theme in this is that parents are using this as a tool to help teach their children and not as a babysitting device.
Some of my fondest memories from being a child.
Understand that my mother is definitely not a gamer.
She doesn't even really know how to turn a computer on.
If she needed something done on the computer, my dad or myself got asked to do it.
Some of the best memories I have of childhood was when she would...
My mom and I used to take turns playing Super Mario Bros.
That was also how I developed my blindfold level 8-1 skill.
Wow.
That's hot.
I can't do it anymore.
I mean, it's been way too long since I've done it.
But level 8-1, there's like a definite pattern to the whole stage and it is possible to do it blindfolded.
There's a pattern really to the whole game, right?
Well, not if you have, not for the Hammer Brother levels because they're all random.
Oh, that's true.
Their patterns are random, but you can do level 8-1 blindfolded.
You can do the first level blindfolded too.
Huh.
But yeah, but anyway, that's how I, you know, I learned that by playing with my mom.
Very cool.
Alright, let's see.
Moving on.
Loki!
Yes.
What's going on over at Konami?
Our buddies at Konami.
You know, I had to laugh when I read this news about Konami getting in trouble with the Crime Life advertisement.
First off, the advertisement isn't really that bad anyways.
It's just people overreacting again.
But, anyways, the whole, you know,
DarkSakura
The Advertising Standards Authority upheld the complaint against it and wanted them to pull it.
I think it's really stupid because when you look at it, most of the advertisements that we see nowadays are just
Nothing.
And I don't think that they really take violence and nudity and stuff like that seriously over in the UK.
At least not as much as we, I mean, we're just like completely conservative about everything, you know, whereas they're more liberal about it.
I was going to say rabid, but, you know.
Shouldn't Konami just write off Crime Life at this point?
I mean, really?
Is this a title they need to be backing?
No.
It was one of those, like, let's pay the rent this month type titles.
Let me put it this way.
The game initially was going to come out at about $49.99.
They dropped it to $20.
And then the reviews on it just sucked.
So it was a nice try, but, you know, just like Nintendo wrote off the Virtual Boy.
A travesty.
You just got to take your mistakes and say, you know what?
We messed up.
All right.
Well, we've been in a bit of a feisty mood tonight.
One reason for that is we're really excited about something as well that's going on here at Orange Lounge Radio.
And to help us talk about what's going on here at Orange Lounge Radio tonight, we decided to invite on a very special guest.
We always talk about support independent podcasting, support podcasters.
We're here to...
Back up what other folks do out there in the independent podcast revolution.
We would not exist without the support of other folks out there.
And one of the folks that's always been very supportive of our show, and we just love him to death, is the one and only Bobby Blackwolf from the Bobby Blackwolf Show over at AllGames.com.
And he's actually on the line with us right now.
Bobby, you there?
Yeah, I am.
How are you?
Good.
How are you, Bobby?
How was your show tonight?
Good one?
Yeah, it went pretty good.
It's interesting because Bobby and I, we tape almost the exact same time, but it's just because we've done it that way for a long time, so it just kind of works out that way, funny sometimes.
But you can download his show as a podcast just like you can download ours, so it allows you to stay in touch with both of them, so it's awesome.
All right, so Bobby, tell us first off a little bit about allgames.com.
What is this website that you're a part of?
Okay, well, it's a sequel to Left Behind.
No, I'm just kidding.
Somebody else is feeling a little feisty tonight.
Sorry.
Allgames.com was started by Scott Rubin about 10 years ago.
A lot of people here may recognize the name Scott Rubin from G4TV.com.
He was the original male host.
Before then, he ran the Allgames Network, which started off doing radio, a weekly radio show in real audio back in 1996.
Then he joined up with Pseudo Online Interactive to do kind of an IPTV network, is what it would be called today, using real video.
and he oversaw 15 hours worth of gaming content a week.
A daily live show and all that stuff.
That's hardcore because real audio and real video, like streaming and stuff, that stuff was a pain in the ass.
I mean, that's what our college radio station used to use.
That stuff was a pain.
So I know that takes a lot of dedication.
Apple made it easy for people to podcast in comparison.
Yeah.
Unfortunately, the dot-com bust came out and...
All Games Network died, pretty much, in the .com bust.
And then Comcast brought him over to help start G4.
So he moved out to Los Angeles, started G4, thought that they were going to be taking all these risks with gaming television programming.
And unfortunately, they just didn't understand.
And in about 2004, he said, okay, their vision is gone.
They're going in a completely different direction.
I want out.
And so he got out.
relaunched allgames.com.
Now he has a production company.
He's developing television, radio, and internet content all devoted to gaming.
And All Games Radio is one of those parts.
Awesome.
Now what's your involvement with all of this then?
Okay, well I've been a fan of Scott Rubin's work.
I've been listening to his stuff and watching his stuff since 97.
I went over, worked with G4.
I was actually a moderator on their forums back when G4 actually was good.
which they're not... Ancient history.
And so when he relaunched AllGames.com, I really kind of was in the right place at the right time.
I'd been around long enough, and he basically let me help him with his site, with his forums, and then he had a live 365 station.
I'm like, hey, let me do a show.
I did a show in 2004, and we had the MP3 archives of the show, which is what it was called.
The podcasting was very new.
Now, we actually have All Games Radio as a 24-7 music station.
I pretty much run it.
We play game music, or we play talk programming, either his show, which is every weeknight, live from the Arena Interactive Lounge in Santa Monica, or my show on Sunday nights.
This arena interactive lounge sounds pretty awesome because it sounds like a place where you can just kind of go and like just kind of like kick back, have a beer, play some games.
Here's Scott over there doing a show.
Sounds pretty awesome.
Wait, I guess you can't really have a beer.
This is California, huh?
Okay, have a root beer.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Here's what you do.
It's BYOB.
If you bring your own, you can have it there.
Okay.
And they'll store it for you.
There you go.
Maybe during E3, me and Jamie and Loki will all come with some Guinness and game it up right.
It'd be quite expensive on my part.
All right.
Well, anyway, so you have a show over on All Games.
What's your show all about?
What's the Bobby Blackwolf show about?
It's a one-person show.
We talk about news, we have a toll-free number that people can call in with Skype.
And basically just running down the news, and I do some interviews.
We had Tommy Tallarico on the show last week for about an hour and a half.
We even asked a question from you.
I know.
I actually listened to the show.
This was weird for me because we didn't have Orange Lounge Radio last week.
I was kind of like, hmm, what am I going to do tonight?
I can't really listen to my own show because there is no show.
I'll go listen to Bobby's show.
I never get a chance to listen to Bobby's show live.
I want to see how it is live versus taped.
And he had Tommy Tallarico on, and I thought that was kind of crazy because we've been known to give Tommy a little bit of a hard time here on this program.
Yeah.
Just a little bit.
So it was kind of funny.
So you know I had to ask a question.
And you know, Loki, where do you think I went?
Of all the Tommy Tallarico things, what do you think I had to ask about?
Remember what else he's involved in.
He was involved in a lot of things, actually.
Right.
But the music stuff.
Right.
Video games live, of course.
So if I had to ask him any question about video games live, what do you think I brought up?
I don't even know.
It was Pong.
I had to ask, why Pong?
Why Pong?
And of course he said, basically his ten minute answer or whatever it was, basically boiled down to, dude, it's eight seconds of Pong.
Thanks for watching!
I was like, God damn it, that show sucked.
It's not his fault.
It's the writers.
Do you know what I learned about that show?
Well, I don't know if I should say.
Let's get back on topic here.
Please.
So you have your program and you get some pretty cool interviews once in a while, yeah?
Yep, pretty much.
All right, so give us the details real quick.
How can we tune into your show if we want to hear it?
AllGamesRadio.com is the URL for my show.
Why do we have you on the show tonight?
Is there some type of ulterior motive that we have you on the program tonight?
Yes.
Go for it, Bobby.
Okay, well, essentially what we've done, I've been talking with Rob and, you know, to DarkSakura and Loki over there, and we have extended an official invitation to re-air this program you're listening on our stream on Monday nights.
So what, essentially what will happen is it's going to air on Monday nights at 7 p.m.
Eastern, 7 p.m.
Pacific, with Scott Rubin's All Games Interactive is going to run right up to it, and then people will get to listen to both Part A and Part B.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Yes, it is.
There it is.
So if you want to hear Part B before we push on the podcast stream, because sometimes we're lazy and we slack off here at OLR, but all games, they're on it.
They've got our Part B. They're going to play it Monday nights, so you can hear that in advance.
And more than anything, we're just kind of excited to be a part of this and kind of work together, because independent productions and podcasts and things shouldn't work against each other.
They should work together.
So we're very happy to be on board, Bobby, and thank you so much for thinking of us.
And I want to...
I was at G4 volunteering when Tech TV occurred.
We're not changing anything about OLR.
We don't want to take over your station.
We don't want to change any content or anything.
We're just re-airing the same show trying to expand it to a new audience.
That's what I love.
And honestly, what makes me so honored is because they're coming and saying, we like what you do as is.
And I'm like, wow, somebody likes us.
No, it's great.
That gives me the warm fuzzies.
I know, it's nice.
So thank you for giving us the warm fuzzies.
We love it.
Any other exciting programming coming as well to all games?
Well, one of the things that we're doing, we're going to be all at GDC in San Jose, and we are actually going to be broadcasting on All Games Radio on the Thursday night of GDC the Game Audio Network Guild Awards, which is going to be a two-hour award show with live music, live performances, and
Giving awards for music of the year, audio of the year, and all that.
We're going to be backstage there doing some interviews then.
And then Friday night for my show, I'm going to be backstage at Video Games Live asking why Pong.
And we'll be airing those on my show that weekend.
That's going to be so awesome.
I can't believe we're like a part of this in a roundabout way.
We're a part of the same station, so that's awesome.
I'm going to be listening to that.
It's going to be awesome.
What else is in store in the future of AllGames.com?
Maybe not necessarily just programming, but what's in store for the website, the whole vision of AllGames?
Well, we're going to be adding some other podcasts.
We've approached other independent podcasters.
Y'all are just the first.
Going to be putting a lot more podcasts on.
Just so people can find new podcasts.
Scott Rubin does a lot of television production.
We've got a short film done by a man named Michael Hyland called As Real As Your Life.
It was premiered at the TED conference during David Perry's.
It's going to be screened at GDC, I believe.
It's about video game addiction.
We're going to take that to film festivals.
There's some television programs, too, that we're pitching that we can't talk more about yet.
Awesome.
I have to give you the pitch for OLR TV later.
Okay.
All right.
Anyway, no, seriously, though, thank you so much, Bobby.
And please pass along our thanks to Scott as well.
We're really excited to be on board and just kind of get our show out there and be a part of this growing network.
It's awesome.
Yep.
And if anybody listening live, I'm in your chat room, and if they want to ask questions and calm fears or something, they can feel free to see me in there.
On this end, guys, nothing's changing.
Well, there are other changes coming to OLR, but it has nothing to do with this.
It's all us that we're changing.
And I guess I'll just go ahead and say it.
We're going to be making our station – we're going to be putting a little more oomph in our station because we ran a poll on Orange Lounge Radio, and we found –
DarkSakura, Loki, and maybe someday Spike can work with you too, come on your show.
Thank you guys for accepting.
Not a problem.
You take care, Bobby.
You too.
Bye-bye.
Bobby Blackwolf, that website again, www.allgames.com slash podcast.
If you want to hear Bobby's show, allgames.com, Orange Lounge Radio starts on Monday.
And some of you guys might actually be hearing this show on allgames.com for the first time tomorrow.
But it was actually yesterday when we taped, forget it.
All right, Loki, take us out of this hour or hour and a half that we're turning into with a little story here about DDR and email and what the heck?
Yes, yet another stupid idea brought to you by Microsoft.
Now, this one's actually called StepMail, and that's right, it uses a DDR pad to check your email.
And it's actually part of this new interface called StepUI, and basically their whole spin on this is, you know what, you're not exercising enough while you're browsing on your PC, and this is a better way to do that.
Honestly, folks, how long does it take to check email?
Like, two minutes?
Do we really need to be walking around on a giant pad that really is obtrusive and just... No.
I think this is the dumbest idea ever.
It's like, that's almost as dumb as, like, saying, okay, I'm going to control my car with this dance pad as well.
Are we sure that something's just not being horribly, horribly misinterpreted or misreported here?
This is straight on Microsoft's website, okay?
I just want you to know that this isn't like some sort of thing that they're making up.
This shows picture of some woman stepping on a dance pad, which, by the way, looks like a red octane pad.
And, yes, and it shows the interface right here.
You know, up, down, close, open, folders, delete.
I like how you have to jump to do different things.
It looks so dumb.
It's completely retarded.
And then they've got a photo viewing thing, which looks like someone crapped it out in about two seconds.
You know what would be sweet is if the announcer from DDR Extreme would read your email.
You've got mail!
You've got mail!
It's your new record!
Whatever that guy says, you know?
You know what?
Come get Viagra at our store for free!
What they need to do is have a program that hooks up to your email and a little pedal that you put on the ground so that you're sitting down and you're doing like a recumbent bike.
And the moment you stop pedaling, your email closes.
Don't they have these net bikes?
They do at the gym!
They should have something like that at home.
The study shows, using this program, the average heart rate is increased almost 20% while using StepMail and 13% for StepPhoto.
Really though, why would you be looking at photos?
I mean, can you imagine?
I want to look through my picture album.
Let me set up this giant dance pad.
And then someone walks in the room, what the hell are you doing, you complete retard?
I'm checking my photos in email!
Yes, and you're lame.
Here it is, here it is, here it is.
Imagine this.
You're going to have a party.
You're going to have an adult party.
And so you could get X-rated pictures to look at on this thing and play Naked Twister on the DDR mat.
What do you think?
I think that's retarded.
I think that's the only reason this thing's going to get used, ever.
This thing will never get used.
It will be some stupid study that Microsoft wastes their money on.
Then later on next year, come tax time, they'll be like, you know what?
We lost money on this.
Tax write-off!
That's right.
All this is is a tax write-off.
What applications do you think this will have on the origami?
Well, I can tell you this much, that the dance pad is almost the size of the origami.
And on that note, we're going to go ahead and take a break here.
We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio in a little bit.
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
