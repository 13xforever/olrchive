Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And we're back here with Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 178.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,520
March the 26th of 2006, a little exciting first half there, talked about Game Developers Conference.

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,400
Whole lot of news there in the first half, so if you haven't heard it yet, if this is

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,320
maybe the first episode of Orange Lounge Radio you're ever hearing, that's cool, but

8
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,160
remember that we distribute the podcast in two halves, so you might want to look

9
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,920
back in our podcast history there on iTunes or on our website.

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,520
Even on the feed itself, you can go back and retrieve the old MP3s.

11
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,120
Check out the first half of the show as well for a lot of news. But that doesn't

12
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,240
mean the news is done yet, we've got plenty more to come, including, now I thought this

13
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,560
rumor was already done with, Loki, Microsoft entering the portable market, I thought the

14
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,880
origami thing came and went, but what's happening now, Loki?

15
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,740
Well there's another rumor going around, this time it's brought to you by Dean Takahashi

16
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:17,320
of the Mercury News, and basically running a story that Jay Allard leading a team with

17
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,120
Greg Gibson, the system designer for the Xbox 360, and Brian Lee, the finance chief for

18
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:29,120
the Xbox business, and basically working on a device to, you know, combat against the

19
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,260
PSP which is going to do video, music, and games.

20
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:37,980
And the device is supposedly in the early stages of development and should be hitting

21
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,280
store shelves in 2007.

22
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,280
Maybe?

23
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,560
I don't know, there hasn't really been anything that says that.

24
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,640
a lot of rumors because you know it makes sense but

25
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,840
I don't know if it could be a bomb that they'll drop at E3

26
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,200
never know. Yeah

27
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,160
then again it's awfully close to April. Just coming off of this origami stuff within

28
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,840
the past couple weeks too I

29
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,520
take this with a huge grain of salt and a grain of pepper while you're at it I

30
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,480
mean this is kinda

31
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,720
we will see I mean

32
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,880
it suppose you know anybody could be secretly plotting a portable gaming

33
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,000
system there could there could be a secret fourth console being plotted

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,020
right now who knows I mean this is all kind of conspiracy theories in a way

35
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:29,520
the Phantom the return of the Phantom actually there was someone that was

36
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,240
talking about working on a console and I had to laugh oh boy all right well here's

37
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,440
something that's not a rumor well it was a rumor then it was a debunked rumor and

38
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,340
then it turned out to be true so here's the news that you know rumors sometimes

39
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:48,460
do turn out to be true, Dell did acquire Alienware earlier this week, they did announce that

40
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:52,420
they have acquired Alienware and this was after Dell came out and said they were not

41
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,300
looking into buying them.

42
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:09,700
What's interesting is Alienware's kind of response to this.

43
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:14,580
They say here, we believe that this acquisition will offer our customers the best of both

44
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,860
worlds, an Alienware that takes advantage of the world-class business practices and

45
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,960
operational efficiencies that have made Dell one of the most respected companies in the

46
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:27,800
world while preserving the DNA of the Alienware brand and the product strategy portfolio.

47
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:32,160
So perhaps the biggest surprise to most people will be that youíre not going to see a lot

48
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,740
of changes after this announcement.

49
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:38,180
Youíre not going to see Alienware logo show up on Dell products and vice versa.

50
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,940
Our website is not going to change and the majority of our business practices will stay

51
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,740
the same.

52
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:49,740
That quote coming from one of the executives, oh no, that's Alien CEO, Nelson Gonzalez,

53
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,640
so kind of interesting there.

54
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,180
Their perspective on it is like, okay, yeah, Dell bought us, but they're not going to change

55
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:02,540
this yet, although usually in buyouts, change is inevitable, but we'll see, we'll see.

56
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,660
Alright, let's go to another story, we're going to go over to Loki, who has a story

57
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:17,020
about Namco yes ah anyways if you're um excuse me lose my voice here um if

58
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:22,700
you're interested in some fine Namco products then you'll be surprised to

59
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:27,980
know that a club Namco has launched it's basically like an online you know shop

60
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:34,580
for Namco related goodies including t-shirts stuff toys and more whoring of

61
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:41,500
the pac-man franchise correct yes plenty plenty of whoring being done by pac-man

62
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:46,580
but they had some pretty cool stuff like you can get the pac-man and the stuff

63
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:54,620
ghosts as well as Dig Dug and Galaga t-shirts numerous pac-man t-shirts and

64
00:04:54,620 --> 00:05:00,180
including a pac-man like cushion for chair cushion

65
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,980
anything new like Tekken? No?

66
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,780
I want a Pac-Man Ghostie. I actually do have a

67
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:12,020
Pac-Man plushie. Does anybody remember the Pac-Man board game?

68
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,980
Yes. I had this when I was a kid. It was the biggest pain in the ass to set up.

69
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,700
You had this big board of white marbles and a couple of yellow marbles

70
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,980
and like you had the giant Pac-Man things that you could actually go...

71
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,340
it was so lame but at the same time

72
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,340
Maybe this is why my parents really enjoyed when I would play this game

73
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,580
because, you know, it was so tedious to set up the board

74
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:37,780
that it shut me up for a little while, so who knows. Sorry, that was random.

75
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:42,820
We do that on the show, deal. Moving on, Dark Sakura likes to travel the world

76
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,380
from her laptop and

77
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:48,980
she likes to bring us some news for our friends overseas, like what's going on in

78
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,740
the UK?

79
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,100
There's several things going on, although some of this

80
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,200
also floats the international scene,

81
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,960
I should say. Well, usually, you know, a lot of times the news does, the stuff we

82
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,920
talk about here happens there, stuff that happens there

83
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,760
goes on over here, so it's inevitable. Well, Scott Henson of Microsoft

84
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,980
is basically going through considerations on how to improve the

85
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,080
Xbox 360 dashboard and multimedia.

86
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,520
Actually, this sort of stems from some of the results of the

87
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,040
PS3's online interface, but they basically left

88
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:27,180
the dashboard for the 360 as something that is infinitely upgradable.

89
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,440
Smart.

90
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,560
They have been talking to, taking the suggestions of those people on

91
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,680
Xbox Live who've been turning them in

92
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,880
and are trying to put more features on there

93
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,140
that the Xbox market will want.

94
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,820
Something I learned this week, when you set a picture as your background,

95
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,400
I'd like to be able to set different pictures for different pages

96
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,040
in the dashboard. So if anybody from Microsoft's listening,

97
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,360
That would be my suggestion, allow more customization in that aspect.

98
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,360
It doesn't cost me points, thank you.

99
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,520
Well there is a comment on here just to

100
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,160
quote.

101
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,300
You said the capability is there. There are a lot of

102
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,600
there are all kinds of features that have come in.

103
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,640
One of the top requested features is the ability to download from the marketplace in

104
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,440
the background, so we're looking at it and prioritizing that list of requests.

105
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,420
Basically didn't comment on anything in particular. They're also talking about

106
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:22,020
um... their uh... hd specifications how they want to keep it high but aren't

107
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:26,980
gonna they're gonna keep it in the level of this listeners are focusing on

108
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,460
okay not listeners

109
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,780
players right

110
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:35,520
sorry ending of our listeners but i love you all

111
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,220
you know there's also um... mention consideration of blue ray but i don't

112
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,820
know that they're necessarily going to be looking into it

113
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:49,520
Honestly, I'm tired of hearing about all the blu-ray rumors versus HD DVD and blah blah blah. Yeah

114
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,980
also

115
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:57,940
Something that we did touch on earlier. They're going to be Megadrive games on the revolution

116
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,100
to go ahead and clear things up for our u.s. Listeners in

117
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,420
Europe the

118
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,580
Genesis was called the Megadrive as it was in Japan

119
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,420
So we are going to be seeing

120
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:14,180
Genesis Mega Drive games on the Revolution available. They're doing, they

121
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:19,980
call it the Virtual Console, will feature NES, Super Nintendo games,

122
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:26,860
TurboGrafx, and backwards compatible GameCube through the disk drive. But Sega

123
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:31,940
is, we actually have a quote from Nalya Tsurumi, who's the CEO of Sega

124
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,220
America and Sega Europe. Sega's support of the Virtual Console system will

125
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,340
introduce more gamers to the classic Mega Drive hits and reinvigorate many

126
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,620
of our popular brands.

127
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,740
That's interesting, now why did they release it with two separate names? Why did they re-brand

128
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,660
at the Genesis here? Because I didn't follow, do you know? Because I didn't follow that

129
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,200
whole saga, this is years ago.

130
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,980
I don't know, it has to be part of a marketing deal or whatever, but like a, for example,

131
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,340
Sega CD was the Mega CD, it's just how it was.

132
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:02,980
How they did it, alright, whatever. So you Europe folks, whenever we're talking about,

133
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:07,360
you know, hooray, Sega Genesis games are compatible, just know that for you, replace Genesis with

134
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,140
Mega Drive, and you're good.

135
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,700
or SEGA does what Nintendo don't.

136
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,420
Oh, stop. Moving on.

137
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,380
Um...

138
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,620
Guess what game's gonna be on the DS?

139
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,900
Uh... Well, I already know, because I looked at the outline for tonight, but, uh...

140
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,900
Play along!

141
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,660
I don't know Dark Sakura. What game will be playable on the DS?

142
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,540
A gun game!

143
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,580
Oh, right! I like guns.

144
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,100
But not really.

145
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,300
Point Blank is gonna be out on the DS.

146
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,140
Uh, we'll use the stylus.

147
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,060
I was hoping for Wild Gunman.

148
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:34,580
No, I won't.

149
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,380
Or Hogan's Alley.

150
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,220
Gangster Town.

151
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:36,780
Alright, anyway.

152
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,580
from the Master System since we've been talking about Sega.

153
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,240
Point blank was cool too.

154
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,040
I really dig point blank,

155
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,880
but basically, instead of using the light gun,

156
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,280
you're gonna use the stylus, tap on the screen.

157
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,040
You have your arcade mode.

158
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,040
You have 40 different sequences

159
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,740
that are gonna be coming up from the arcade

160
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,900
in the PlayStation games.

161
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:00,080
You'll shoot clay pigeons, cardboard cutouts, aliens,

162
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,940
everything, little bouncing balls, Pac-Man, not really.

163
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,340
All right.

164
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,500
There's a wireless multiplayer mode that's going to work with one card,

165
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:14,300
a high score free play mode, a few others.

166
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,900
There's going to be a

167
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,300
a mode called brain massage which analyzes and offers feedback as you play.

168
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:25,740
Brain training anyone? The other is called games museum

169
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,960
kinda on the wording there but um...

170
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,660
it's basically adapted

171
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,600
older point blank levels.

172
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,080
levels. I think that's kind of an interesting concept. I'm surprised we haven't seen this

173
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,120
yet, or at least if it's been out, I haven't heard of it, so sorry.

174
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,120
Like a gun game with the stylus, it's kind of,

175
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,560
I'm kind of surprised it's taken us this long to get there, but... You know what I'd like to see?

176
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,640
A neat idea.

177
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,360
Is the Gun Survivor series, the Biohazard Gun Survivor series. Oh my gosh, wow.

178
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,600
With the stylus. You know, I actually really enjoy playing,

179
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,880
because when we went to Las Vegas way back when on the DDR Freak Moderators

180
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,560
trip,

181
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,280
I got to play Biohazard Gun Survivor 2.

182
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,320
which was the one set in the Code Veronica universe and that was cool

183
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,480
it was always, you controlled it with the gun

184
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,120
I always felt they should have a game like that on the DS where you're controlling it

185
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,000
and then using your

186
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,040
d-pad to shoot to, you know, but

187
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,840
no one ever listens to my suggestions in the video game industry. I had a gun con

188
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,840
I don't, which is

189
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,040
strange because I usually don't collect a lot of the accessories but I did have a

190
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,600
gun con, I like point blank. I have my gun con too

191
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,320
I actually have the upgraded gun con

192
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,360
because I wanted to get Vampire Knight. I never did.

193
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,080
Oh well. And besides that, it's all about House of the Dead.

194
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,800
So, there's a little bit more.

195
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,480
There was an announcement by Nintendo

196
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,960
and British Telecom saying that they're going to be over 600 Wi-Fi hotspots

197
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,400
for the DS and other Wi-Fi capable units.

198
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,320
It's a Nintendo UK and BT open zone

199
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:05,740
announced that they are going to have these hotspots open up to retailers

200
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:10,740
across the UK and Ireland. The hotspots are going to provide these retailers and

201
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:16,220
their customers with ways to use the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection service.

202
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:22,940
There's also going to be different playable demos, movies of upcoming titles,

203
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:27,820
sort of how we saw at E3 that are going to be available. Some of these items are

204
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,720
are going to be, um, actually some of these locations, I'm sorry,

205
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,400
there's the download stations located at Game, Game Station, HMV, Toys R Us,

206
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,700
Smith's Toys, and other different retailers across, uh,

207
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:45,840
the area. Uh, games to be initially included in downloads, Plarium, Meteos,

208
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,280
um, you get to meet, uh, Miyamoto's Nintendog pick.

209
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,960
Um, upcoming downloads in April and May, they're going to be Pokemon Link,

210
00:12:53,960 --> 00:13:00,680
Trauma Center under the knife, Dr. Kalashima's brain training, how old is your brain?

211
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:08,420
Other playables, there's going to be special items for Animal Crossing, and a special Metroid

212
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,720
Prime Hunter's movie.

213
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,080
You know, I'm kind of surprised we don't see, and maybe the internet kind of kills this,

214
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:19,400
but I'm surprised we don't see DS clubs pop up at little coffee shops and things where

215
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,920
people could convene once a week, bring your DS and play games,

216
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,720
beam demos to each other, because a lot of games, like I think Meteos has in some of the other games,

217
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,560
you can beam a demo of the game to somebody with a DS, you know, like

218
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,160
just kind of like meet up and play some DS games in person, because while

219
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,320
Wi-Fi is cool and all, there's something to be... about having that feedback in

220
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,280
person of somebody going, ah, you bastard, you know,

221
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,960
you killed me and all that stuff. Keep in mind those demos only stay on your system as long as

222
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,800
as your system is not turned off.

223
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:53,140
Well that's true, but you know, I remember E3, we downloaded the Meteos demo, my buddy

224
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:56,160
Brad and I downloaded the Meteos demo, went back to the hotel that night and played all

225
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,160
night long.

226
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,160
It was awesome.

227
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,520
Well see, I actually downloaded Electroplankton.

228
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,960
I was never able to get that game, I was never ever able to get that game, like it was always

229
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,960
full whenever I tried to grab it.

230
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,280
I was playing Electroplankton in the line to get into the Playstation 3.

231
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,000
Oh yeah, that's cool.

232
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,700
But I think that, you know, it's a really cool thing, I think, that Nintendo's doing

233
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,840
by having all these various hotspots.

234
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:25,100
Not only is it opening more places for gamers to get the new stuff as it comes out, making

235
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:30,440
it available, it's offering more interactivity among gamers, I think.

236
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:35,320
The closest thing I've seen to this, besides, of course, those, you know, game cafes, is

237
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,600
I was at a coffee shop not too long ago and saw three people with a laptop playing Quake.

238
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:52,000
Also, not to say it's the very least, but we have the last segment in our UK news, which

239
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
is release date!

240
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,400
Alright, what kind of cool stuff is coming out for the UK folks?

241
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,720
On the 30th, we have Brick Em All and funny cards on the Game Boy Advance.

242
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,840
We have Animal Crossing coming out on the 31st.

243
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,840
About time!

244
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:11,440
You know, I really hope that the friend code thing works internationally because I've got a bunch of people on there

245
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm going to be making room for new people. Hmm. So definitely let's play with some of our UK listeners

246
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:21,680
Also armored core 9 breaker on ps2 battle of Europe condemned criminal originals

247
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,000
Condemned a pretty neat game

248
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,440
CSI three dimensions of murder Desperados 2 far cry instincts evolution and predator

249
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:37,920
Ice Age 2, the Meltdown video game. We have Odama, Outrun 2006. Love Outrun.

250
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,880
Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney, grab it while you can.

251
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,400
Resident Evil, Deadly Silence, Tales of Fantasia, which actually excites me.

252
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:51,000
That's where all our copies of Phoenix Wright went. They went over to Europe.

253
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,880
Also there's a tie three, Night of the Quinkan and Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon

254
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,360
advanced warfighter.

255
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,520
Very cool. Lots of stuff to look forward to over there in the UK. Lots of good stuff.

256
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,840
Outrun.

257
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,880
How about the US? What's coming up in the US?

258
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,640
Fun stuff, of course. Of course we've got...

259
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:16,120
Kingdom Hearts 2 and Beatmania. Yes, Kingdom Hearts 2 and Beatmania. That's on my list, yes.

260
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,800
We do have some other games, of course.

261
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,200
Far Cry Instincts Predator if you're having a 360.

262
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:30,920
Rumble Roses XX, which should be a girl-tastic, and there's also going to be full spectrum

263
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:35,600
warrior 10 hammers on Playstation 2 and Xbox.

264
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,200
And I believe, I want to say those are the major ones here, I'm sure I'm forgetting something.

265
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,400
Let me take a quick look-see here.

266
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:48,040
Oh, I'm sorry, Far Cry Instinct's Evolution, that's right, the one that's coming out, the

267
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,520
expansion that's coming out on the Xbox as well.

268
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,320
And Dicey Warriors 5, Empires.

269
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:01,520
For the 360, it's only $39.99 if you're interested.

270
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:08,200
And for your GameCube fans, Harvest Moon Magic Melody, yet another Harvest Moon game.

271
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,000
Cows and sheep and puppies.

272
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I don't hear a lot about GameCube games anymore, which is kind of sad.

273
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,720
About two a month.

274
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,720
Too bad.

275
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,280
Now, Orange Mountains Radio started as a station dedicated to music and rhythm video games,

276
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,440
so of course we like to keep tabs on what's going on in that scene, because of course

277
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,320
a lot of our listeners that have been listening to us for the four years we've been going

278
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,800
expect it once in a while.

279
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,480
We're going to talk about music news.

280
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,800
So Loki, some news going on with In the Groove this week, right?

281
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,660
Yeah, In the Groove is having their PC beta right now.

282
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:47,500
You can actually go download it off their beta website and you can play a two song demo.

283
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,640
Now haven't I played this beta before when it was called StepMania?

284
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,640
You may have.

285
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,720
Just curious.

286
00:17:53,720 --> 00:18:00,940
Ironically enough, I did poke around the data files on there and yep, it is StepMania.

287
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,740
To set this up for folks who may not know what we're talking about here, In the Groove

288
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,220
is a DDR-like game that came out

289
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,860
and it's based off a PC

290
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:16,340
simulator for DDR that's a few years old called StepMania.

291
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:20,060
They got together with the folks that made StepMania and out came In The

292
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:20,500
Groove.

293
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,220
But now you're saying when you poked around these files you found that...

294
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,580
Okay, basically the way it is set up here, they have

295
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,620
instead of having all your sim files and everything in there, they have a

296
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,660
directory of

297
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:36,740
pack files or PCK files and there's one file that's an index file for that. That

298
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,660
basically tells the program how to

299
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:43,120
unzip everything and extract it so you can play it. And that way you can't go and

300
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,820
mess around with the files because they're encrypted and

301
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:49,440
compressed. But when you look at the index file

302
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,980
you notice a couple things. First off you have

303
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,720
they actually have.sm on the

304
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,960
files. And the best part about this

305
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,600
You know how they have in StepMania when you're doing edits and stuff and it'll have

306
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,280
you know, your directory, your folder,

307
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,240
you can switch between different folders and stuff to edit songs. Well, they still left it in there

308
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,760
in the Integroove beta. They left

309
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,840
in the folder stuff so you can actually see what exactly looks exactly like the

310
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,240
StepMania step editor

311
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,360
and... Now this is an early build though, right? They may take some of this out or what?

312
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,260
I guess they could, but...

313
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,260
Or it could be a marketing tool.

314
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,260
Hey, make your own song.

315
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,980
I just hope they're not selling or planning on selling this because I don't see the point.

316
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,980
Well, DDR came out on the PC and a lot of people didn't see the point of that.

317
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:42,400
Yeah, but it's not based on a game that's been out there already or a program that's

318
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,820
been out there already that's free.

319
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:50,780
You know actually how I think that Rockstar could sell more copies of this.

320
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,440
Make this PC release coming up.

321
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,480
If they're doing this, make it into Groove 2.

322
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,120
it for the PC before you release it on consoles. Well, some people will buy them both, just

323
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,000
have them both. Well, here's the cool, I guess the cool thing about it, you can make edits

324
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,020
and transfer them to USB drive so you can actually go and play the arcade, you know,

325
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:10,300
your edits on the arcade. Okay. I guess that's kind of cool, but I think you can pretty much

326
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:17,260
do that anyways if you have StepMania. I think there's a way to do it, yeah, but... So, I

327
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:23,140
don't know, I'm... Okay, well, remember, remember, we are, and some of our listeners too, our

328
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:27,120
listeners that are music game-oriented, put yourself on the issue is we are a minority

329
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,680
of the gaming public at large. A lot of the gaming public has no idea that StepMania even

330
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:38,160
exists and when they see this on store shelves, I might be a parent buying this for my kid

331
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:43,520
going, oh, I want my kid to get fit and I don't have a console, but I have a PC. So

332
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,560
that's where this game's going to sell. I don't think it's going to really sell amongst

333
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,160
the hardcore. Let me put it this way. Same thing with DDR. I always said the exact same

334
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:55,840
thing about DDR PC. It's the only reason to have that. I mean, it's a crappy release compared

335
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,700
to most of the console ones. The only reason to have it is for, A, all the downloadable

336
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:07,440
characters like Mr. Spanky, and B, to have it on the PC when you don't have a console

337
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,340
in your house, like if you're a family that doesn't have a console in your house.

338
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:17,740
So I mean, it's just, it's very lazy to me, to be honest, if it's, I don't know, it's

339
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:23,220
just, well if you're willing to check it out, if you want to check it out, here's where

340
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,220
you gotta go.

341
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:33,600
Just go to www.inthegroove.com slash page slash itg underscore pc underscore mac underscore

342
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,820
demo underscore beta, if that's easy enough for you guys.

343
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:43,980
And you'll fill out a nice little survey and you'll download a torrent file where you can

344
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,780
download the actual beta.

345
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:50,000
Which might take a little bit of time because apparently the torrent speeds are pretty slow.

346
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,100
Mine went pretty quick, but I don't know.

347
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:56,780
I played it and immediately when I played the game, you know, I tried it out to see

348
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,900
if it's anything special.

349
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,340
It just reinforced the fact why I don't like In the Groove.

350
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,840
So I don't know.

351
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,540
Go ahead, check it out, but it's just StepMania.

352
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,540
That's all it is.

353
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,540
Alright.

354
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:14,620
Moving on, real quick note, there's really not a lot to say about this, Spider-Man 3

355
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:19,800
is coming out for the revolution, that's about all there is to say, Spider-Man 3 is coming

356
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:24,480
out for the revolution, the game, not really a big surprise seeing as usually these movie

357
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,280
type games tend to be released on all the consoles, right?

358
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:33,680
But now what may be a little bit of a surprise is that if you trace the big corporate structure,

359
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:39,600
Sony somewhat funds the Spider-Man franchise, so you would think it would be a PS3 exclusive,

360
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,940
but not really.

361
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,940
It's not the way it's going to go.

362
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:46,160
Where there's money to be made, they will release the games.

363
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,960
So that's that.

364
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,280
Loki, you also have another release news information?

365
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:57,360
Yeah, 99 Nights, which is another kind of Dynasty Warriors-ish game that's out in Japan

366
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,000
right now, is going to be coming to the US in the fall.

367
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And that should be pretty cool.

368
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,320
like a pretty decent game so does that mean we'll finally get the demo one of

369
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,680
these days yeah well actually the demo just needs a hit on live right now

370
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:16,600
they're just offering it as like a you know what on the CD only or DVD only so

371
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,840
as soon as that hits on live then yeah you can actually probably play the demo

372
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:26,080
here in the States but um I don't know until then we just need more games that's

373
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,760
all Ron Chan says in our chat room there over to orange launch radio.com click on

374
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:37,360
chat, a note for me, if I recall correctly, Activision owns the console rights to Spider-Man.

375
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,800
That may be true, but who do they buy those rights from?

376
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:48,000
Moving on, we're going to get into another story here, Dark Sakura, you have another

377
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
release information.

378
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,760
Actually, I do, and normally I hold off, I only mention the releases that are coming

379
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:59,080
out in the following week for the UK releases, I do have one to add though that was brought

380
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:04,120
to my attention by our longtime listener Simmel who's actually listening right now at 4 a.m.

381
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,120
4, 5, 6 a.m.

382
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,120
That's hardcore.

383
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,440
Yeah, that is hardcore.

384
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:15,620
That Guitar Hero is actually getting a UK release on 7th of April for 50 pounds.

385
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:19,080
It's getting a lot, a lot, it still gets a lot, a lot of coverage.

386
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,760
Well, it's expensive here too.

387
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,120
You know, I'm almost...

388
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,720
But that comparably is more expensive than it was here.

389
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:31,240
Don't get me wrong, I think Guitar Hero is a great game, but at the same time, I'm really

390
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,960
starting to get sick of hearing about it all the time, and how revolutionary it is when

391
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,960
you kind of think...

392
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,600
Keep in mind, we've had it for a while, they haven't had it yet, they're...

393
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:46,180
No, I know, no, no, the mention of this makes me think about how saturated Guitar Hero is

394
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:52,440
over here right now, and don't get me wrong, it's a great game and all, but you know, it

395
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,440
doesn't...

396
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,720
It's not that revolutionary.

397
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,840
It's not that revolutionary to me, because we've had Guitar Freaks, we've had Frequency,

398
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,280
we've had Amplitude.

399
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:06,080
The only thing that kind of sold this game was the fun element of it, and the way they

400
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,140
kind of tied it all together.

401
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:13,920
But I'm kind of like, okay everybody, let's move on, let's get to new games.

402
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,880
I'm glad that it is coming out of here, because I feel like a lot of people have missed out

403
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,880
on it.

404
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,880
I really enjoy it.

405
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,880
Yeah, they can check it out.

406
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,480
We've got our second guitar now.

407
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,280
I know, I've seen that they sell the guitars separately, too.

408
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,440
They have a red one that costs like $10 more.

409
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,240
I bet Konami's kicking their butts right now for not releasing guitar freaks here a couple

410
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,240
years ago.

411
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,640
Should have had more faith in music games over here, Konami Japan.

412
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:40,600
Anyway, there's another game that we're going to be seeing at E3.

413
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,600
What's that?

414
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:50,200
Bioware is going to have some stuff out for an Xbox 360 RPG called Mass Effect.

415
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:57,240
So they're saying, it's speculated either this year or next, it's going to have players

416
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:04,800
who form bands of adventurers and go on and kick alien butt in the future, you know, go

417
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,800
around different planets, explore them, pillage as you roam, you know, go to different solar

418
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,720
systems, different places.

419
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:20,960
BioWare spoke to IGN during the Game Developers Conference and said that prior to the battles

420
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,260
which are going to be in real time, players can get together and make strategies, can

421
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:31,800
swap characters when the fights go on, you have your different types of characters, your

422
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:37,200
typical ones like your long short range or healer, blah blah blah.

423
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:43,440
But it looks pretty cool, I'll get some pictures of this for our people who are listening live,

424
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,440
we are going to be able to see it for a demo at E3 this year.

425
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,440
Among many, many other things at E3 this year.

426
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,440
We're going to be busy.

427
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,440
We're going to have to divvy it up between us.

428
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,440
There's no way we're going to hit it all.

429
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,440
We're going to have to get the book and sit on the floor in the lobby.

430
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,440
Okay, you go here, here, and here, and I'm going to be like, Sega.

431
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,440
I know, I know.

432
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,440
I'm crossing my fingers and my toes that we are going to get the media thing after all,

433
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,440
so we'll get to go in a little bit early.

434
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,640
thinking I'm pretty much going to burn that time waiting in line for Nintendo

435
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,880
Revolution because I know that is the first place I want to go.

436
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,200
Press doesn't have to wait.

437
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,380
No we don't.

438
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,880
Shit, cool.

439
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,080
I didn't know. Well I'm hoping, I'm crossing my fingers and my toes we get to

440
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,240
get to see it because I really want to share with you guys all about that and of

441
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,760
course we will be broadcasting from E3,

442
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,400
still working out some details, but you can look forward to daily podcasts just like we did last year.

443
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,200
I want to be able to broadcast

444
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,200
I told you so!

445
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,340
Well, the listeners might be the ones broadcasting back to you, buddy.

446
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,340
You better be careful.

447
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:48,640
All right, anyway, moving on to another story.

448
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,800
You were talking in the first half, Loki, about you've been playing Elder Scrolls IV

449
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,800
Oblivion.

450
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,960
Now, the game's already broken.

451
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,560
You were talking about a bug earlier where you couldn't jump in a certain point of the

452
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,560
game.

453
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:05,440
You stuck because you were floating on a rock or something, but what else is broken in Oblivion?

454
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:10,840
And while sometimes the load times tend to be extremely long, and this is because the

455
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:16,900
hard drive, it caches the game to the hard drive so that it loads faster and plays faster,

456
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,060
but sometimes it gets fragmented.

457
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:24,800
However, at least they figured out that that's possible and what they did is built in a fix

458
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,800
for it.

459
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,880
So if you do have that happen where your load times are excruciatingly long, what you need

460
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:35,800
do is actually hold down the A button when you, you know, reset the game and let it boot

461
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:40,800
up to the title screen and that's it.

462
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,240
So pretty simple, but at least they built in a fix for it.

463
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,560
Is that in the manual?

464
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,120
Or do you just have to kind of figure that out?

465
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,680
No, that's not in the manual.

466
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,760
Alright.

467
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,760
You know what?

468
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,760
Broken things make me angry.

469
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,440
I don't know about you, but broken things make me angry.

470
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,120
I don't like it when my games are broken.

471
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,560
And so that takes us to the FUs of the week.

472
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:01,600
This is the part of the show where we get a little bit angry at things, and they might

473
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,160
have to do with gaming, and they might not, but we're here to vent, so please listen to

474
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,720
us for a little bit as we get a little angsty.

475
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,760
Are you ready to get angsty, Dark Sakura?

476
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,760
Am I ever.

477
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,760
All right, you're gonna start us off.

478
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:25,560
My F.U. of the week goes to Tequila.

479
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:31,980
oh tequila how you make me suffer you make my stomach hurt worse than anything

480
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:37,680
in the universe ever does anything less than Patron is not worth drinking oh how

481
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:44,080
I hate thee dear tequila die not love dark sakura

482
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:51,040
all right I'm laughing because I was there that night were there you also an

483
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:56,880
F you to cheap sour mix, but mostly cheap tequila.

484
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,480
You know what, Jason was telling me that he's regretting not taking pictures of you passed

485
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,480
out because it would have been pretty funny now.

486
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,480
What?

487
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:09,520
He didn't get any, but he told me regret's not taking any.

488
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,520
What?

489
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,520
Okay, I...

490
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,400
Admit it, it would be funny in context.

491
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:20,800
To explain, I have insanely good alcohol tolerance, however, I have zero tolerance when it comes

492
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:26,200
On top of that, I think I am somewhat allergic to it because I woke up with a rash on my

493
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,680
neck, which I only get a rash on my neck if I have had something, if I consumed something

494
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,680
I am allergic to.

495
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,680
So I think I am allergic to tequila.

496
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,200
You know, we haven't done a drunk show in a while.

497
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,200
We have not.

498
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,160
You know, I was reading a negative review about this show on the internet somewhere

499
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,200
that says that it is very unprofessional for us to be doing a drunk show.

500
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:50,480
And I am thinking to myself, okay, the whole point of independent podcasting is to do things

501
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,880
That other people are too afraid to do

502
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:59,320
So the drunk shows are some of our listeners most favorite shows and we're always responsible about it

503
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:03,360
We always give disclaimers about it. So get off your high horse asshole

504
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:08,060
What I have a designated driver to pick me up always always we do it safe

505
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:12,600
So, I don't know I just had to get that that's that's another f you f you to a but you know

506
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:18,480
I actually am that but as far as my I've been I've seen you drink on the show in the one time

507
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,600
I got sick on the show from drinking was with that cheap tequila that was sitting on top of your refrigerator

508
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,320
At the old apartment that stuff was now. What was cheap?

509
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:34,440
What I was drinking that tequila, and I finished what a fourth of the bottle, and then I got really sick and ate waffles

510
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,820
Oh, thank you chat room chat room makes an excellent point here Gk

511
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,960
128 says dig nation was taped at the bar two weeks ago, and I know that

512
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,600
This week in tech has done shows at pubs and stuff so that guy can go

513
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,000
So take a fly and leap.

514
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,400
I was watching a show where it was a science experiment show where they had people going

515
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:02,080
out and taking them to the pub to get smashed off their butt and then go the next day and

516
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,280
find out what was the best hangover cure.

517
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:11,240
We always set limits, be safe about it.

518
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,600
I think now we have to set a date to do another one.

519
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:21,480
Just defy these negative reviews and reaffirm our independence from these corporate non-drinking

520
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,480
entities.

521
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,240
You know what, the only way for me to actually be significantly drunk on the show is if I

522
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,640
put down the $16 and get a couple bottles of chamet.

523
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,040
Well then we'll just all have to chip in and make it happen.

524
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,520
Well I'm good.

525
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,280
That is the, for the record, that is the only beer that will have me drunk in one pint.

526
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,720
Alright, we gotta keep moving, we gotta keep moving.

527
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,720
Let's get to the game segments.

528
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,240
Okay, your F.U. real quick.

529
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:45,240
Um, just a stupid driver, because I've seen too many people today, like,

530
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,160
going in the wrong direction on the road.

531
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,580
Well, is it like, you know, when we're at lunch? Are you sure you just weren't playing a lot of burnout? No, when we're going,

532
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:54,640
when we're at lunch, you know, the women trying to back up.

533
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,120
Oh, yeah, the chick that was trying to back up, yeah, yeah, that was kind of crazy.

534
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,280
Just, you know, I don't know.

535
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,040
Stupid people.

536
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,320
My F.U. would have to be

537
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:07,040
too, uh, having to be sober while everyone else I was with was, like,

538
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:12,160
literally everyone I was with Friday night was drunk, but I had to be sober

539
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,340
because it's very responsible to have a sober driver

540
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:20,560
but next time it will not be me. Mark my words, it will not be me next time.

541
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:24,440
Somebody else gets to play. Alright, that's it.

542
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:31,200
Moving on, next segment. Our next story we're gonna go over to

543
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,120
me and we're gonna talk about the video game voter network. We mentioned this on a

544
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,500
previous podcast.

545
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,580
Last week we were talking about the Video Game Voters Network.

546
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,580
It just launched.

547
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:47,120
Weíll get this, 20,000 messages were sent to U.S. Senators in just a week of this network

548
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,120
being up.

549
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:53,340
So you guys really took action on this really quickly and of course something we may not

550
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:57,100
have mentioned last week because it wasnít exactly clear to us at that time, but the

551
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,860
ESA does have a hand in this.

552
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:05,260
This is I believe the ESA kind of their response to all this stuff going on is to really mobilize

553
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:09,400
the gaming community but I stand by what I said last week it's a smart idea and

554
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,520
if you're sick of all this stuff you got to do something about it right just like

555
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,140
the kid we were talking about in the first half that was getting sued you

556
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:18,340
know if you want to make change you got to do something about it also what I

557
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:21,160
thought was interesting is that on the site now they actually have a letter

558
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:26,620
from Will Wright, Will Wright of course made many many classic games and what

559
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:30,260
he's working on that spore thing now it's supposed to be this

560
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:35,080
This is a hugely comprehensive game, this is going to be insane.

561
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,540
Will Wright actually posted a letter to the site there urging people to join.

562
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:43,680
So if you don't want to join Video Game Voters Network because we told you to, then consider

563
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:48,120
Will Wright's opinion for a minute, because that man's made a lot of great stuff.

564
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:57,600
All right, let's go over now to Loki, who has a story speaking of legal things.

565
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,900
You've got to file patents when you're going to do new stuff.

566
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,280
And sometimes it tells us what's coming up, right, Loki?

567
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,160
Yeah, well, the story that actually came out this week

568
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:10,360
about the PSP keyboard, it's actually

569
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,440
kind of there is a patent for a keyboard that

570
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,960
was going to be used via the USB port on the PSP, which

571
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,420
is kind of retarded when you think about it because that

572
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:22,080
would mean that the keyboard is above the monitor

573
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,080
when you're typing.

574
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,720
So that would be completely awkward.

575
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:31,360
But that was one of the things that came out, and they had kind of like a cell phone little

576
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,920
doohickey on there.

577
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:38,120
So I don't know if that's something that they're still working on, but this was actually I

578
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:43,360
think shown at E3 a couple years ago, I want to say, when they originally showed the PSP.

579
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:47,680
I want to say that this was one of the things that they showed, or maybe it was at one of

580
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,600
the shows, and they had actual pictures of it that I've seen.

581
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,680
But I don't think it's anything, they're probably going to change it some.

582
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,440
that was interesting however there was another patent though that was filed that

583
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,200
I thought was pretty interesting

584
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,860
and that would be by Take Two for Vice City Stories

585
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:07,080
the next PSP Grand Theft Auto game. Hoo-yah!

586
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:11,840
We think, right? I mean it's speculation but they have filed a

587
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:15,160
patent on this name. Well, trademark. Sorry, trademark on the name.

588
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,280
You can't patent a name, sorry. Even I should know that.

589
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,600
Alright, interesting.

590
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,040
Moving on, I got a story here on Windows

591
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:30,000
Vista, of course this is going to be the next XP, the next version of Windows.

592
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,680
Get this, if you want to be playing games on Windows Vista, they're saying that you're

593
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:41,460
going to have to have two gigs of RAM in order to play games on Windows Vista.

594
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:47,080
They're saying that 900 Meg seems to be the bare minimum to even use Word or PowerPoint.

595
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,600
If you want to play Halo 2 or any of that stuff, you're going to have to have two gigs

596
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,960
of RAM to play on Windows Vista.

597
00:36:53,960 --> 00:37:00,080
I suppose a little bit of this is rumor right now, but we'll see for sure when the system

598
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,080
comes out.

599
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:04,600
All I can say is that I guess I'm glad I did upgrade this system to 2GB of RAM, so that

600
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,000
if I decide to get Windows Vista, I'll be okay and good to go.

601
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,280
Look, you had another quick story on the Vista, though.

602
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:16,420
Yeah, there was a rumor that the code was being reprogrammed by the Xbox team, and that

603
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:19,560
rumor was, of course, debunked.

604
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,240
Microsoft is saying no, that's not the case.

605
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,440
Take it as a rumor.

606
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,400
You know what's interesting? That program that I downloaded onto the

607
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,920
computer to allow my Xbox to get the pictures and stuff from the network for

608
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,940
my 360.

609
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:38,680
The program actually looks like the Xbox 360 when you launch it. Like it makes

610
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,880
your desktop look like the Xbox 360.

611
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,800
It's kind of cute that they have that consistency going on.

612
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,940
Interesting.

613
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:49,860
I'm really looking forward to getting my Mac now even more.

614
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:53,300
You know they do have a program for the Mac that'll let you

615
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:56,820
connect with your 360. I think it's called Connect360, I think is the name of it.

616
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:00,100
I don't think it does everything, but it'll do like the songs and stuff.

617
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,900
I think it costs money, though. I don't know if it's totally free.

618
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:06,260
The one thing, though, I'm going to be happy about my Mac is running virtual PC

619
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:10,420
so I can still play Ragnarok, because Ragnarok will run just fine

620
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:13,860
on virtual PC, and then run everything else that I need

621
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:19,860
Me too. I can play World of Warcraft, I can actually even do podcasting and...

622
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:24,320
Yeah, you're gonna have to get hooked up with GarageBand, the new one, it's very intricate

623
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,440
when it comes to podcasting. I've tried to look at what we can do for this show with

624
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:27,940
it, but yeah.

625
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:34,080
Well, I'm also going to be, start using whatever their broadcaster is for Pumped Volume, which

626
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,760
will be this week.

627
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,360
Very cool. That's one of our spin-off shows on Orange Lounge Radio Live.

628
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:38,780
Yes.

629
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,860
And that's Tuesday nights?

630
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,640
Tuesday nights.

631
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,760
And I do a show on Wednesday nights.

632
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,700
Live music.

633
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:46,720
And Extafur is coming back at some point, I think he's going to move to Thursdays though.

634
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,380
And who knows, we're still looking for more talent, if you want to do a live show on our

635
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:54,800
network we might be able to hook you up, that would be cool.

636
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,200
Speaking of Extafur, he's in the house right now, he just walked in, I guess he was on

637
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:06,200
a little bit of a road trip there, and Extafur, didn't you go to like a big deal concert this

638
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,200
week?

639
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,560
Yes I did.

640
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,560
First off, welcome to the show.

641
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,040
Thank you, and you guys are speaking of me?

642
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,800
Yes, your ears must have been burning.

643
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,800
Oh, wow.

644
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,800
You start sneezing a lot?

645
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,800
No.

646
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,320
When's your show coming back, your spin-off show?

647
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,640
I'm thinking maybe in a couple weeks.

648
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,080
And if you think we're politically incorrect on this show, oh my gosh, listen next for

649
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,080
Show Some Night.

650
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,080
Because he doesn't even really talk about games.

651
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,120
Do you ever talk about games on your show?

652
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,640
I can talk about video games.

653
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,080
Alright, well you need to talk about video games tonight.

654
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,080
What happened?

655
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,320
You got to do something video game related that myself, Logie Darkstalker, none of us

656
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,320
got to do.

657
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,320
What did you do?

658
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:47,920
Games Live, which was a concert in San Jose that they put on, and basically it's a bunch

659
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:55,640
of video game music that is live with the orchestra.

660
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:03,440
There was a choir there, and also I guess that one guy from that one show is hosting

661
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,440
it.

662
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,440
Tommy Tallarico, yeah.

663
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:12,240
I don't know all of their names, but I can say that all of the music that they played

664
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,000
was very beautiful.

665
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:21,520
They played pieces from World of Warcraft, there was EverQuest 2, there was Kingdom Hearts,

666
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:26,440
there was Zelda, there was Mario, there was Castlevania, apparently there was Metal Gear

667
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,560
Solid, which I didn't see because we came in a little bit late.

668
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,840
So you missed the pong.

669
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,000
I want to know about the pong.

670
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,680
They did Frogger, which wasn't that good.

671
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,440
I heard on Bobby Black Wolf's show when he had Tommy Tallarico on that he was saying

672
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,520
something about this whole Frogger setup, that they have people play live.

673
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,880
What did they do?

674
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:53,720
They were playing the game live and the conductor was conducting the music as they were playing

675
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,720
the game.

676
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,640
So it was like you were hearing the live music.

677
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:01,400
It was a very expensive way to play a game, I guess.

678
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,400
They joked about it.

679
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,560
Well, didn't they give somebody a laptop for winning?

680
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:09,000
They gave somebody a very nice laptop for winning at Frogger.

681
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,040
He wasn't even that good, but he got a very nice...

682
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,360
I don't know what it was called, but it's a very nice laptop.

683
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,360
Was it Alienware?

684
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,360
Is that it?

685
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,360
I don't know.

686
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,360
But it was very nice.

687
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,560
I have memories of Frogger.

688
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,560
That's just weird.

689
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,560
It's a cool game.

690
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:29,460
memories of being in middle school at the roller rink playing frog girl on roller skates?

691
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:34,580
Did any of it make you cry? You know it didn't. I was there with my boyfriend, he was crying

692
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:40,020
a little bit at some things. But no, they were, it was very nice and we sat like three

693
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:47,020
seats, three aisles from the front. So we had very good seats and the conductor was

694
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:52,920
funny that Tommy guy wasn't and basically you know as somebody that

695
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,780
doesn't play a lot of video games I really do like the music you know

696
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:01,900
because I I see it as the same as music that from motion pictures because it's

697
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:06,580
just the same thing I mean just scores you know like they are scoring a movie

698
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:12,780
and I've always liked soundtracks soundtrack music so I was I was kind of

699
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:21,320
in my, you know, own place. I was very well... I thought it was a very well-done thing that

700
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,320
they did.

701
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,320
Alright.

702
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,320
So, yeah.

703
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,640
Alright, well, thanks for that little mini-review of Video Games Live.

704
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,640
Yeah.

705
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,280
So, now, this is touring, so would you recommend our listeners go see it?

706
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,280
Yeah.

707
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,260
I think it's touring, right? It was touring, then it wasn't touring. I'm pretty sure they'll

708
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,640
do more shows of this, though.

709
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:39,140
Yeah, they... I think it's really cool. I think a lot of people would be interested.

710
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:44,020
If you like Halo, they did a huge thing from Halo at the end, it was a finale, and they

711
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:49,260
had the actual guy who composed the music that was there, and they also had a lot of

712
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:52,060
video game composers in the audience.

713
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:57,820
You know that you were at the show during a really big week in video gaming in San Jose,

714
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:58,820
right?

715
00:42:58,820 --> 00:42:59,820
Right.

716
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:07,260
Well, apparently they had the big gaming thing in the same place as we went, but they also

717
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:11,260
I also had the composer of World of Warcraft there. He was there. So that was kind of cool.

718
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:15,260
When you do play games, that's all you ever play.

719
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:19,260
I was in my element.

720
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:23,260
Favorite song that they played all night?

721
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:27,260
I think I would say Advent Rising.

722
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:31,260
I've never played the game. I've heard that it's not that good.

723
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:35,260
I thought that the music was gorgeous.

724
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:40,100
game just has really horrible frame rate issues, so yeah.

725
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,300
Alright, maybe we'll have to check that out.

726
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,180
Yeah, it was gorgeous.

727
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:46,380
And Kingdom Hearts was very well done, too.

728
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,060
Did they do Simple and Clean from Kingdom Hearts?

729
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:53,420
Well, it was the theme to the first game, so yeah, it did have that Simple and Clean

730
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:54,420
theme.

731
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:55,420
Cool.

732
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:56,420
Alright.

733
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:57,420
Thank you, Xfer.

734
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:58,420
Appreciate it.

735
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:59,420
No problemo.

736
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,180
Alright, we're going to go over to DarkSakura every week.

737
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:06,680
She climbs the internet up and down and searches to find a great website to share with you

738
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,980
guys as her website of the week.

739
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:13,160
So, DarkSakura, where should the kids be pointing their Firefox browsers to this time because

740
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:16,000
if they are using Internet Explorer, they really should switch, right?

741
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:30,320
a

742
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:34,000
Really makes me giggle, but basically this is a tech

743
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,480
It's a a tech site, but it's not like the tech sites that

744
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:44,000
Are about you know big massive amounts of jargon?

745
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,620
To go ahead and put their about us page. I'll just read a little bit of this

746
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,600
Website for technology and you're currently surfing it. Thank you very much

747
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:58,880
This site is very much different from the other technology site for the very reason that we bring technology close to the end user

748
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:05,880
Many an end-user do not want to be bugged by big high and mighty terms and would like to understand how a certain technology works and so on and so forth.

749
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:09,880
But what we do is different. We put technology in terms that people understand.

750
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:18,880
We put it into fun casual manners so expect lots of weird examples and analogies involving toilet bowls and kitchen sinks. That's where we're different.

751
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:24,880
We do not emphasize the news. Websites like Slashdot do that. We do not emphasize on reviews. Websites like Tom's Hardware does that.

752
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,240
We emphasize on knowledge knowledge for the common end-user. I

753
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:31,920
Thought that was pretty cool

754
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,520
I kind of want to check that out that's almost like my teaching style too when I teach things

755
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:40,400
I make all these crazy analogies to real life starts in my day job. I'm a teacher for a business

756
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,840
so kind of interesting what impresses me is that they have an

757
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:51,160
explanation on what leet and new bar and to quote this every article in the site will have a new bow meter and it

758
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:54,800
It states how rudimentary the article is about.

759
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,680
For example, if the noobometer is at an extreme noob end, then the article is just perfect

760
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:59,680
for beginners.

761
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,340
On the other hand, if the noobometer is at an extreme leet end, the article is for more

762
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,340
leet users.

763
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:06,200
Warning, extreme noobness ahead.

764
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,200
Warning, warning.

765
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,200
Remember, because being a noob ain't fun.

766
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,080
This site instantly gets my uber kudos.

767
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:16,720
All right, website of the week, leettech1337.

768
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,280
Thank you, Dark Soccer.

769
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:23,600
Let's go over to Loki, who has some news regarding piracy.

770
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:35,960
Yeah, of course, no basically, I don't know, this whole thing with the 360 and the firmware

771
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:42,320
for the DVD and stuff, just, I don't know, not a really good thing, but, another interesting

772
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:46,000
thing though for those actual pirates out there who are trying to make some money by

773
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:52,360
by selling those bootleg copies, while certain developers aren't going to actually take that

774
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,720
lying down.

775
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:59,440
There is a story about a Russian software developer who is literally going to beat up

776
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:04,280
one of the pirates, and I thought that was kind of funny.

777
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:12,280
And basically, he spotted his software for sale legally at a market in Moscow, and basically

778
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:18,840
We got into a fight with him and now is going to take him to an actual boxing match.

779
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:22,140
Wait, so the developer is actually going to...

780
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:28,120
This is like celebrity boxing on Fox, in a way, is kind of what it reminds me of.

781
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,680
In the main event!

782
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,680
Interesting.

783
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,180
Yeah, so...

784
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:35,920
This will not be a fight night thing, this will be real life, right?

785
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,240
Fight night, round four, against the pirates.

786
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,520
No, I don't know.

787
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:53,600
I thought Fight Night Round R. Alright, NVIDIA is the maker of popular graphics cards out

788
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,600
there.

789
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,600
Some of you have them in your very own PCs.

790
00:47:55,600 --> 00:48:00,680
Well, they announced this last week that they have a new design contract with Sony.

791
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:05,720
They're going to get more money than what they earned for creating the graphics processor

792
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:08,960
for the upcoming PlayStation 3 video game console.

793
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,560
This deal is going to run through 2007, but the thing is that we don't really know what

794
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,120
this chip is for.

795
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:18,280
Could it be possibly about the PSP2?

796
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,280
Who knows?

797
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,640
They might be bragging about the deal, but they can't talk about the details just yet,

798
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,260
so it could be just about anything.

799
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:31,640
So Nvidia has a deal with Sony to make something, but we don't know what.

800
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:35,080
I would likely say it's the PSP2.

801
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:44,900
Once in a while, we like to hear back from our listeners and have you guys interact with

802
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:49,840
us live on the program, and we do that using our Skype line.

803
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,980
So to get more information on the Skype line, all you have to do is head on over to our

804
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:58,580
website www.orangelaungeradio.com and click on interact with us and get all the details

805
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:00,720
on contacting us on Skype.

806
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:07,800
Please remember though, if you're going to call us on Skype, please call ECHO123 first

807
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,760
to test your connection to make sure it works.

808
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:15,480
You can also pick up the regular telephone and call us, 916-226-9067, but please keep

809
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:21,100
in mind that that may be a toll call, so please have the phone line owner's permission before

810
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:22,100
you call in.

811
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:26,440
Also, we're going to be moving the Skype line on a bit more permanent basis towards

812
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:30,540
the end of the show in response to recent feedback that our Skype line sometimes gets

813
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:31,940
a little too random.

814
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:35,540
So what we want this to be is more the end of the show kind of open forum.

815
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:40,060
So for our callers to be able to discuss basically whatever is on their mind.

816
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:44,820
There will be a more topical version of interaction that we'll announce in a later week.

817
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:45,820
So here we go.

818
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:46,820
We're going to go ahead and pick up the phone.

819
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:47,820
Take our first call.

820
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:48,820
Hi.

821
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:49,820
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

822
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:50,820
Hi.

823
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:51,820
This is Simil.

824
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:52,820
Hi, Simil.

825
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:53,820
What's on your mind, buddy?

826
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:58,820
Just a quick call, just about you actually badmassing the UK.

827
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:03,820
Wait a minute, we're getting video of you here in the studio too, that is crazy.

828
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:08,820
Look at this, we can actually see this guy who's calling in right now. I've never seen that happen on Skype before.

829
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:09,820
That's pretty cool.

830
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:10,820
That's kind of cool.

831
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:14,820
I'm looking a bit tired because it's like half five now.

832
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:16,820
It's got to be like five or six over there.

833
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:19,820
Alright, what did we do to bash on the UK? I'm sorry bud, what did we do?

834
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:23,820
Just about when Guitar Hero was...

835
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:27,320
Yeah, Guitar Hero?

836
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:30,500
I think the video may be slowing our connection there a little bit.

837
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:36,580
You had a question there in response to Guitar Hero, were we bashing on it a little bit there

838
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:37,580
or what?

839
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:44,540
Yeah, just the fact that, yeah, I'm just trying to get rid of it.

840
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:45,540
I gotta let that one go.

841
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:50,060
I'm so sorry, Simo, but we just got really, really bad feedback there, and I think people's

842
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:53,860
speakers exploded during that, so sorry about that.

843
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:55,460
You guys should not bash on the UK.

844
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,460
We don't!

845
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:57,460
Shame on you!

846
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:58,460
We weren't!

847
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:02,900
I made a whole segment just to read UK news, thank you.

848
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:07,700
It's probably my fault, because I was saying that Guitar Heroes was a little bit, like,

849
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:11,100
I'm a little sick of it here, but I understand, no, I understand you guys are getting it for

850
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:15,100
the first time over there in the UK, yes, you should check this game out, it's just

851
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:20,300
that I am getting sick of hearing it in the US it's it's time for us to move on

852
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:26,980
guess what what guitar hero let you call me when you've got guitar hero 2 to talk

853
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:30,420

862
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:26,340
Phoenix Wright you all know about my horrible Phoenix Wright addiction that's

863
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:28,980
right I remember hearing about that a couple weeks ago on the show how is

864
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,980
Phoenix Wright going? Have you beat it yet?

865
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:32,980
Oh, like four times.

866
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:34,980
Dang! Wow, very cool.

867
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:36,980
Weren't you the one that had to drive a long ways

868
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:38,980
to get it?

869
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:40,980
Yeah, like six hours or so.

870
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:42,980
That is hardcore, so I guess you have to beat a game

871
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:44,980
four times after that type of dedication.

872
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:46,980
Any other feedback to

873
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:48,980
stories we've been talking about tonight, Roz?

874
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:50,980
Tonight?

875
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:52,980
I came in late.

876
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:56,980
Let's see here.

877
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:06,980
Well, that's okay. You'll just have to, you know, download the podcast so you can catch up on the first half, what you missed, or you can listen to our syndication on allgames.com, because they play our show in its entirety as well, so.

878
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:12,980
Yeah, I was desperately trying to get my mic to work last week, uh, to talk about the, uh, whole girl gamers issue.

879
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:18,980
Oh, sure, we can still talk about that. What's on your mind in regards to the girl gamer issue?

880
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:29,140
Well, obviously not being a dude kind of pisses me off how, you know, the negative stereotypes

881
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:35,780
and stuff, and I don't know, I just don't know what everyone's collective deal is.

882
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:41,800
I mean, you know, it's always a big deal when people find out that I'm not a dude.

883
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:46,860
People react in such weird ways sometimes to those sorts of little revelations.

884
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:51,140
It's weird because I think MMOs make gaming more personal, Xbox Live and all that stuff

885
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:54,780
makes gaming more personal and you want to find more about the people that you're playing

886
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:59,320
the games with and people have all these preconceived notions.

887
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,500
We talked about this a little bit last week so I don't want to rehash the old conversation

888
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:05,600
but it's interesting nonetheless.

889
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:09,780
But I also noticed and something that was being talked about in our forums a little

890
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:13,760
bit was also that there's two extremes going on.

891
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:19,580
You have the gamer babes websites, you know, that like, oh, there's all these hot gamers

892
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:22,840
out there, and all girl gamers are really hot babes.

893
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:26,720
But then somebody posted in our forums that they're really sick of people assuming that

894
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:31,960
because they're a girl, they must be, you know, fat and ugly and have nothing else to

895
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:34,640
do but play games, which is a bunch of crap.

896
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,140
Sure there's fat and ugly people that play games, and sure there's beautiful people that

897
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:39,780
play games, but you know what?

898
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:44,380
Those are the two extremes, and this is what we call a bell curve.

899
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:48,500
And most people are somewhere in between, you know, most of us are just, we're average

900
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:49,500
looking.

901
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,500
Yeah, pretty much.

902
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:56,340
You know, I think that SSJ100 Matt actually just said it kind of best in the chat room.

903
00:54:56,340 --> 00:55:00,060
You know, most people are like, oh my god, you're a girl, ASL pics please.

904
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:05,180
I get that crap on, not on the current Ragnarok that I'm playing on, because people are like,

905
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:09,540
oh, you're cool, you're not a bot, but on IRO I got it all the time.

906
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:27,540
Yeah, I moderate at a role-playing forum, and all of my characters are male, pretty much, and so when people find out that I'm not a guy, it tends to freak them out, and then I get, like, all these people pouring in on Messenger trying to, you know, hit on me.

907
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:30,540
And that's invisible all the time.

908
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:35,540
Don't you get people that assume you must be a lesbian because you play a male character? Because I've heard girls tell me that.

909
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,540
I've had that.

910
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:38,540
Yeah, it's so stupid. So stupid.

911
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:42,540
Then again, how many female characters online are really, you know, boys?

912
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:46,040
Exactly, and you know, we just had the emails from the,

913
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:50,300
you know, the guys that play the girl characters because they are

914
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:54,180
good characters in the games. It has nothing to do with, it's just, it's so silly.

915
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:58,740
Yeah, it is. Alright, people need to put stereotypes aside. That's what they need to do.

916
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:02,380
Alright, Roz, thank you so much for your call. Appreciate it. Yep.

917
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:07,940
Alright, have a good one. Bye. Bye-bye. Alright, we're gonna go ahead and go to another call here. Let's go

918
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:38,940
Was it?

919
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:39,940
Yeah.

920
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:40,940
Hi, Xander.

921
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:41,940
No, it's Xander from Connecticut.

922
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:42,940
Alright, Xander from Connecticut.

923
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:43,940
What's on your mind?

924
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:44,940
Um...

925
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:45,940
Guitar Hero?

926
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:46,940
No.

927
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:47,940
Wait.

928
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:48,940
That's...

929
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:49,940
I'm not going to start that way.

930
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:50,940
Yeah, please don't.

931
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:51,940
Okay.

932
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:53,940
You overrate Guitar Hero.

933
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:54,940
Me?

934
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:56,940
I overrate Guitar Hero?

935
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:59,940
Well, everybody does, but...

936
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:00,940
Yeah.

937
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:01,940
Don't...

938
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:04,940
How can one overrate one's own personal opinion of the game?

939
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:05,940
Well, it's just like...

940
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:06,940
Okay.

941
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:09,840
with my personal opinion, and my personal opinion is God.

942
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:12,460
I'm gonna hit you with a trap in a second.

943
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:15,580
Okay, so what, you don't like Guitar Hero?

944
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:17,780
No, I like it, it's just overrated.

945
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:22,340
Okay, that's fair enough. I would say, yeah, I get a little weird when I see

946
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:24,900
Guitar Hero winning all these innovation awards because

947
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:29,420
I wonder if it's winning it for the right reasons, and I don't suspect it is.

948
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:32,780
You know what I mean? Like, sure it's innovative when it comes to the, you know,

949
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:35,380
fun factor and all the little in-game stuff,

950
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:40,500
but the game itself is not a hugely original concept.

951
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:44,580
It's a fusion of two existing concepts in my mind,

952
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:47,940
and that doesn't make it a bad game. I love Guitar Hero, it's a great game,

953
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:51,500
but I'm a little, you know, I'm kinda over it now, you know what I mean?

954
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:54,820
It's time for me to move on to another music game for now.

955
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:58,940
I think the reason it got so high scores though is because it got all that

956
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:02,940
licensed music and crap on it. And I totally agree, and I think

957
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:09,780
Konami made some mistakes in not having more faith in the U.S. audience and spending the

958
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:13,680
money on some higher licenses when they came out here and I take my hats off to Red Octane

959
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:20,180
for recognizing that and harmonics as well.

960
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:23,860
We give Konami a lot of love on this show but we have to give them tough love too when

961
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:25,660
the time is appropriate.

962
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:28,260
So everybody deserves tough love I guess.

963
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:29,260
I know.

964
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:33,300
Anything else on your mind, Xander?

965
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:40,620
On the girl gamer thingy, I just want to say I'm upset as a male asexual that I don't get

966
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:41,620
bashed.

967
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:46,580
Seriously, the gays get bashed, the girls get bashed, and crap.

968
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:47,580
Why don't I get bashed?

969
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:48,580
That's not fair.

970
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:49,580
This is a term...

971
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:50,580
We do secretly bash you.

972
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:53,160
Okay, I bash you every night in the chat room.

973
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,060
They're all talking about you behind your back.

974
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:56,060
No, no, okay.

975
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:58,920
Define this for me again, because this is a term that a lot of our podcast listeners

976
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:00,020
are probably going, huh?

977
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:02,620
You define yourself as asexual, which means?

978
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:03,620
Yes.

979
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:06,700
It means I'm an amoeba.

980
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,260
Are you a eunuch?

981
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:12,980
It means that he doesn't think about sex, period.

982
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:17,300
Okay, because if you're eunuch, I was just going to say, you wouldn't have balls.

983
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:21,380
Okay, just quiet over there, okay extrovert?

984
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:22,380
All right.

985
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:30,380
So, well, do you ever get asked in games, like ASL and all this, do you ever have people try to cyber flirt with you or whatever?

986
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:32,380
I got sent coke music.

987
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:35,380
Coke music? What happened in coke music?

988
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:38,380
Um, I realized it sucked.

989
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:41,380
Why? What happened? Were people hitting on you there?

990
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:45,380
No, it just sucks. It only sucked. I just grew up a little.

991
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:46,380
Okay, okay.

992
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:51,380
Alright, well, can anybody think of a good insult for the asexual gamer?

993
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:53,380
I think I already did.

994
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:55,380
You're a nookulous freak!

995
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:58,380
How's that? Does that count?

996
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:01,380
Does that make you feel better to be bashed there, Xander, a little bit?

997
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:02,380
I guess.

998
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:04,380
Okay, well, we appreciate your call.

999
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:06,380
I don't bash on anybody.

1000
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:10,380
Have a good night and have fun not getting laid, okay?

1001
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:11,380
Okay.

1002
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:12,380
Alright, later.

1003
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:14,380
Let's go to one more call.

1004
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:18,280
all right we better set aside ten minutes Zaku's on the line Zaku what's

1005
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:23,340
on your mind yes remember that link I sent you last week about how MTV

1006
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:29,080
interview this suppose you know this DDR player from around my area I just want

1007
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:33,900
to just want to know whether or not you know you got a chance to even look at it

1008
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:41,280
I'm gonna be honest I didn't all right send me the post post it in chat I will

1009
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:48,000
Again, but honestly, you know if you take a look at it, you know, and personally I think you know

1010
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,220
MTV did a good job in doing it

1011
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:53,500
I wouldn't say they did the best but it's not like you know

1012
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:56,720
They didn't do a lame-ass attempt in trying to try it

1013
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:01,280
You know trying to feed on the stereotype of DDR being a healthy thing said just fit

1014
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:05,120
Okay, set this up for me a little bit exactly what is in this clip if I want if I watch this clip

1015
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:11,200
What am I gonna get you're going to see a you know a DDR player by the name of Anthony also known as sketch

1016
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:16,000
He's one of these one of the best DDR players in the city, and he was interviewed

1017
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,480
He was picked. You know he was interviewed by MTV for overdrive

1018
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:26,080
basically you're gonna see a lot of you know a lot you know a lot of how you know a lot of the the

1019
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:30,140
Perspective of you know you know the hardcore DDR player

1020
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:36,360
The one who basically goes after scores and just you know, it just goes after perfecting, you know

1021
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:44,420
There are their skills not necessarily, you know, not you know, it's not even focused at all on the whole healthy aspect of it

1022
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:49,540
All right more game. It's it's a gamer perspective of the game. All right that way Zaku

1023
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:54,520
We will check out the clip during our afterbirth. How's that sound? Yeah. All right, we'll do that man. All right, Zaku

1024
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,780
Have a good one. Thanks for calling in. All right later

1025
01:01:56,780 --> 01:02:08,780
I say get the British guy back on the line, he didn't give him enough time, I mean his connection, but British people, their voices are cool, and you know, we need more coolness.

1026
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:16,780
Well, we gotta go ahead and close the Skype line for now, but if he calls in next week, we'll definitely get him again, and he can yell at me more over Guitar Girl.

1027
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:20,780
I think it's cool that he stays up till five, six in the morning listening to us.

1028
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:21,780
I know, that's dedication.

1029
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:26,820
Well, you know that over on All Games where they syndicate us, they play us at different

1030
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:29,460
times of the day, on Tuesday and Wednesday.

1031
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:34,880
So I think on Tuesday we're played in the morning, so that might be a different time.

1032
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:39,340
So those that want the live experience to kind of listen to this as it goes on can listen

1033
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:42,620
at those times, too, and that can help adjust for time zones.

1034
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:44,180
So something to think about.

1035
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:45,180
Okay.

1036
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:47,580
All right.

1037
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:50,580
Let's go on and get to the last couple stories here.

1038
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:55,340
Something hitting some of the blogs this week about a Famicom game that's really crazy even

1039
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:58,060
though Famicom is about what, 20 years old here?

1040
01:02:58,060 --> 01:02:59,060
Exactly.

1041
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:02,020
Well, when you think of crazy stuff, what do you think of?

1042
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:04,420
At least what I think of crazy Japanese stuff.

1043
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:09,780
I think of MXC, better known as Takashi's Castle.

1044
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:13,460
Who stars in Takashi's Castle but beat Takashi.

1045
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:18,260
And beat Takashi made a game called Takashi's Challenge.

1046
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:23,660
basically the game is kind of it kind of ties in with the bus driving minigame in

1047
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:30,060
the Penn and Teller game but they have such it's basically the game is made by

1048
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:35,660
a man who hates video games it says Takashi's challenge puts the players

1049
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:40,980
through hell like forcing the player to sing karaoke continuously stare at the

1050
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:45,660
stare at a blank monitor pilot a plane that can't go up and then hit the final

1051
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:48,060
boss 20,000 times.

1052
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:51,620
Was this a for real video game that was released, or was this some weirdo one, man?

1053
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:55,500
Apparently Taito released it back in 1986.

1054
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:56,860
Okay.

1055
01:03:56,860 --> 01:03:58,940
Dot, dot, dot.

1056
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:05,140
Taito is the same cracked out company that gave us Bubble Bobble.

1057
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:06,140
This is true.

1058
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:09,620
Alright, any last minute stories you guys want to bring up before we get into the final

1059
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:11,940
story of the night?

1060
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:14,100
I'm sure I've got something here.

1061
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,100
to do

1062
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:16,460
uh...

1063
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:21,500
uh... belfield to demo that was was to come out uh... no twenty fourth

1064
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:22,660
yeah

1065
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:24,180
uh...

1066
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:26,480
about that uh...

1067
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:30,660
you know what's up liar it got pushed back is the i'd love to be liar the week

1068
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:34,940
no he is a lawyer that he has pushed it back and says the come outs on the

1069
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:37,220
twenty-eighth

1070
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:38,620
our twenty nine i'm sorry

1071
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:39,620
uh... between

1072
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:41,740
between twenty at the same

1073
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:47,420
It's just sometime Tuesday and Wednesday, so maybe about like eight o'clock Tuesday night is like partial in between there

1074
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:49,740
Hey, listen, you got burnout and freaking

1075
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:54,960
Blazing angels. So play those while you're waiting. All right. I would yes, sir

1076
01:04:56,100 --> 01:05:00,740
Well, I have something. Okay. This is from old grandma hardcore. Oh

1077
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:04,820
Yes, her that the granny gamer the granny game love her

1078
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:09,460
Basically, there is a chronicle out on YouTube now

1079
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:18,480
And the link is up at ogrannyhardcore.blogspot.com, about how she has laid down some massive,

1080
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:22,540
massive ownage at brain training.

1081
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:29,420
And apparently, there was actually a few of the other people who were playing who actually

1082
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:32,240
said that drinking helped their scores improve.

1083
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:38,660
But Granny had finished her game while the little girl was still going past the time

1084
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:39,660
limit.

1085
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:40,660
Wow.

1086
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:43,460
So, yeah, and there's a movie file up here, so I'm going to share that with our chat

1087
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:53,540
room, but if you go to oghc.blogspot.com, the link is up there for the week of March 20th.

1088
01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:54,540
Very cool.

1089
01:05:54,540 --> 01:06:01,220
All right, I got one last story for you guys here tonight, and it has to do with, I'm sure

1090
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:05,460
a TV show that our folks that listen to us live don't watch, because it's on the same

1091
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:09,180
time as our program, but it does have to do with gaming, believe it or not.

1092
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:14,480
Walt Disney's Buena Vista Games said this week that it is going to be releasing a PC

1093
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:22,900
video game based on the television show Desperate Housewives this fall.

1094
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:28,660
In the game, you will be taking on the role of a new housewife who can either create new

1095
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:35,540
Scandals uncover existing ones over on wisteria lane the street where the show takes place now

1096
01:06:35,540 --> 01:06:41,300
They're saying that Brenda strong who's in the series as the voice of Mary Alice Young who's like the dead wife

1097
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,960
She's signed on for a similar role in the game

1098
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:47,500
They are negotiating with the other cast members to try and appear in the game

1099
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:51,380
So if you've ever wanted to be a desperate housewife, here's your chance

1100
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:57,940
Something tells me those guys that emailed us saying they like to play us the girls something tell

1101
01:06:57,940 --> 01:07:00,900
so something tells me they'll take a pass on this one

1102
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:02,860
call it a hunch

1103
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:05,380
Loki don't you watch Desperate Housewives?

1104
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:05,880
no i don't

1105
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:06,980
oh I thought you did

1106
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:09,980
no Nellie watches Desperate Housewives

1107
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:12,980
I do not watch Desperate Housewives

1108
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:14,700
I don't either

1109
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:17,100
I may have been forced to watch the first season of Desperate Housewives

1110
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:18,920
but that's where it stops

1111
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:20,280
we can't

1112
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:21,800
our show is on the same time here on the west coast

1113
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,820
so we can't watch it even if we wanted to

1114
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:24,320
which I don't

1115
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:26,320
You can watch it.

1116
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:58,320
what what what the hell's her name Gabrielle Carteris no no that was the

1117
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,120
chick in 90210

1118
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:03,600
I know. Same show

1119
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:08,280
what the hell's, oh Eva Longoria that she plays somebody I think

1120
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:12,080
she plays Gabrielle on the show how the hell do I know that okay Eva Longoria

1121
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:15,440
right she's she's the hot one on the show you know I'm sure

1122
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:19,800
a lot of guys wanna you know I guess I don't know you know what forget it

1123
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:22,920
let's let's just end the show let's quit while we're ahead

1124
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:25,920
Uh, and we're gonna go around and get everybody's final thought.

1125
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:26,920
Loki, your final thought.

1126
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:31,920
My final thought is I just read another story that's yet pointing to Nintendo doing VR.

1127
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:36,920
But, it's just rumor stories. I hate rumor stories.

1128
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:38,920
Six weeks, Loki. You can wait.

1129
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:39,920
No, I can't.

1130
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,920
Extafer, your final thought.

1131
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:48,920
Um, to all the girl-babe gamers out there, preach on, brothers. I mean, sistas.

1132
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:58,080
I'm going to pass on the reject false icons this week in order to describe a beverage

1133
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:03,680
called the pangalactic gargle blaster.

1134
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:07,440
It says the effect of the pangalactic gargle blaster is like having your brain smashed

1135
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:10,600
out by a slice of lemon wrapped around a large gold brick.

1136
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:14,320
I need one of those right now.

1137
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:19,220
My final thought would be, I really suck at Geometry Wars and I'm never going to get better

1138
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:22,980
and that makes me a sad gamer.

1139
01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:26,080
