2
00:00:19,821 --> 00:00:25,182
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're back here with Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 178 for this March the 26th of 2006.

3
00:00:25,662 --> 00:00:27,963
[SPEAKER_08]: A little exciting first half there.

4
00:00:28,023 --> 00:00:29,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Talked about Game Developers Conference.

5
00:00:29,803 --> 00:00:31,463
[SPEAKER_08]: A whole lot of news there in the first half.

6
00:00:31,483 --> 00:00:37,024
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you haven't heard it yet, if this is maybe the first episode of Orange Lounge Radio you're ever hearing, that's cool.

7
00:00:37,084 --> 00:00:39,805
[SPEAKER_08]: But remember that we distribute the podcast in two halves.

8
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:44,786
[SPEAKER_08]: So you might want to look back in our podcast history there on iTunes or on our website.

9
00:00:45,154 --> 00:00:48,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Even on the feed itself, you can go back and retrieve the old MP3s.

10
00:00:49,095 --> 00:00:51,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Check out the first half of the show as well for a lot of news.

11
00:00:51,636 --> 00:00:53,437
[SPEAKER_08]: But that doesn't mean the news is done yet.

12
00:00:53,497 --> 00:00:57,879
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got plenty more to come, including... Now, I thought this rumor was already done with, Loki.

13
00:00:57,919 --> 00:00:59,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Microsoft entering the portable market.

14
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:02,180
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought the origami thing came and went.

15
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,541
[SPEAKER_08]: But what's happening now, Loki?

16
00:01:03,741 --> 00:01:05,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's another rumor going around.

17
00:01:05,402 --> 00:01:10,163
[SPEAKER_09]: This time it's brought to you by Dean Takahashi of the Mercury News.

18
00:01:10,884 --> 00:01:13,525
[SPEAKER_09]: And basically running a story that...

19
00:01:14,878 --> 00:01:23,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Jay Allard, leading a team with Greg Gibson, a system designer for the Xbox 360, and Brian Lee, the finance chief for the Xbox business.

20
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:32,532
[SPEAKER_09]: And basically working on a device to combat against the PSP, which is going to do video, music, and games.

21
00:01:33,173 --> 00:01:39,058
[SPEAKER_09]: And the device is supposed to be in the early stages of development and should be hitting store shelves in 2007.

22
00:01:43,197 --> 00:01:43,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

23
00:01:44,378 --> 00:01:44,818
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

24
00:01:44,858 --> 00:01:46,499
[SPEAKER_09]: There hasn't really been anything that says that.

25
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,700
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of rumors because, you know, it makes sense.

26
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,221
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't know.

27
00:01:51,261 --> 00:01:53,662
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be a bomb that they'll drop at E3.

28
00:01:54,443 --> 00:01:54,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Never know.

29
00:01:56,424 --> 00:01:57,064
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

30
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:58,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Then again, it's awfully close to April.

31
00:01:58,945 --> 00:02:06,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Just coming off of this origami stuff within the past couple weeks, too, I take this with a huge grain of salt and a grain of pepper while you're at it.

32
00:02:06,529 --> 00:02:07,349
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, this is kind of...

33
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,541
[SPEAKER_08]: We will see.

34
00:02:09,741 --> 00:02:16,467
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, anybody could be secretly plotting a portable gaming system.

35
00:02:17,288 --> 00:02:20,491
[SPEAKER_08]: There could be a secret fourth console being plotted right now.

36
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:20,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

37
00:02:21,051 --> 00:02:23,113
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, this is all kind of conspiracy theories in a way.

38
00:02:23,313 --> 00:02:24,835
[SPEAKER_08]: The Phantom.

39
00:02:25,095 --> 00:02:26,796
[SPEAKER_08]: The return of the Phantom.

40
00:02:27,077 --> 00:02:31,861
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, there was someone that was talking about working on a console, and I had to laugh.

41
00:02:32,661 --> 00:02:33,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, boy.

42
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,341
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, here's something that's not a rumor.

43
00:02:35,401 --> 00:02:40,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it was a rumor, then it was a debunked rumor, and then it turned out to be true.

44
00:02:40,184 --> 00:02:43,285
[SPEAKER_08]: So here's the news that rumors sometimes do turn out to be true.

45
00:02:43,886 --> 00:02:46,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Dell did acquire Alienware earlier this week.

46
00:02:46,927 --> 00:02:53,451
[SPEAKER_08]: They did announce that they have acquired Alienware, and this was after Dell came out and said they were not looking into buying them.

47
00:02:53,471 --> 00:02:57,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Those liars.

48
00:02:57,433 --> 00:02:57,793
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

49
00:02:57,913 --> 00:02:59,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's our liar of the week right here.

50
00:02:59,454 --> 00:03:00,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Dell Computing.

51
00:03:00,134 --> 00:03:01,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't we have a liar of the week last week?

52
00:03:01,235 --> 00:03:02,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's our liar of the week, Dell.

53
00:03:03,655 --> 00:03:08,099
[SPEAKER_08]: What's interesting is Alienware's response to this.

54
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,380
[SPEAKER_08]: They say here,

55
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:33,817
[SPEAKER_08]: So perhaps the biggest surprise to most people will be that you're not going to see a lot of changes after this announcement.

56
00:03:34,057 --> 00:03:37,819
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not going to see Alienware logos show up on Dell products and vice versa.

57
00:03:38,179 --> 00:03:42,782
[SPEAKER_08]: Our website is not going to change, and the majority of our business practices will stay the same.

58
00:03:43,602 --> 00:03:46,203
[SPEAKER_08]: That quote coming from one of the executives.

59
00:03:46,323 --> 00:03:49,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no, that's Alien CEO Nelson Gonzalez.

60
00:03:49,685 --> 00:03:50,986
[SPEAKER_08]: So kind of interesting there.

61
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:57,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Their perspective on it is like, okay, yeah, Dell bought us, but they're not going to change us yet.

62
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Although usually in buyouts, change is inevitable.

63
00:04:00,352 --> 00:04:00,952
[SPEAKER_08]: But we'll see.

64
00:04:01,113 --> 00:04:01,453
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

65
00:04:02,874 --> 00:04:03,214
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

66
00:04:03,254 --> 00:04:04,175
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to another story.

67
00:04:04,195 --> 00:04:07,317
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to go over to Loki, who has a story about Namco.

68
00:04:08,378 --> 00:04:09,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

69
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, if you're... Excuse me.

70
00:04:14,543 --> 00:04:15,604
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to lose my voice here.

71
00:04:17,065 --> 00:04:24,851
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're interested in some fine Namco products, then you'll be surprised to know that Club Namco has launched.

72
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:26,713
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically like an online...

73
00:04:27,818 --> 00:04:36,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Shop for Namco related goodies including t-shirts, stuffed toys, and more whoring of the Pac-Man franchise, correct?

74
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, plenty of whoring being done by Pac-Man.

75
00:04:42,402 --> 00:04:51,524
[SPEAKER_09]: But they had some pretty cool stuff like you can get Pac-Man and the stuffed ghosts as well as Dig Dug and Galaga t-shirts.

76
00:04:51,997 --> 00:05:00,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Numerous Pac-Man t-shirts, including a Pac-Man cushion for a chair.

77
00:05:00,563 --> 00:05:01,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything new, like Tekken?

78
00:05:03,725 --> 00:05:03,865
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

79
00:05:04,385 --> 00:05:05,926
[SPEAKER_05]: I want a Pac-Man ghostie.

80
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,748
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually do have a Pac-Man plushie.

81
00:05:09,361 --> 00:05:10,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

82
00:05:38,223 --> 00:05:38,544
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura

83
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:56,683
[SPEAKER_05]: There's several things going on, although some of this also floats the international scene, I should say.

84
00:05:56,783 --> 00:05:59,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, a lot of times the news does.

85
00:05:59,565 --> 00:06:01,066
[SPEAKER_08]: The stuff we talk about here happens there.

86
00:06:01,086 --> 00:06:03,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Stuff that happens there goes on over here, so it's inevitable.

87
00:06:04,347 --> 00:06:12,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Scott Henson of Microsoft is basically going through considerations on how to improve the Xbox 360 dashboard and multimedia.

88
00:06:14,012 --> 00:06:19,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, this sort of stems from some of the results of the PS3's online interface.

89
00:06:20,876 --> 00:06:26,602
[SPEAKER_05]: They've basically left the dashboard for the 360 as something that is infinitely upgradable.

90
00:06:27,323 --> 00:06:27,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Smart.

91
00:06:28,524 --> 00:06:40,156
[SPEAKER_05]: They have been taking the suggestions of those people on Xbox Live who've been turning them in and are trying to put more features on there that the Xbox market will want.

92
00:06:41,198 --> 00:06:49,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Something I learned this week, when you set a picture as your background, I'd like to be able to set different pictures for different pages in the dashboard.

93
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,234
[SPEAKER_08]: So if anybody from Microsoft is listening, that would be my suggestion.

94
00:06:52,294 --> 00:06:54,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Allow more customization in that aspect.

95
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:56,000
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't cost me points, thank you.

96
00:06:56,417 --> 00:07:00,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there is a comment on here just to quote.

97
00:07:01,179 --> 00:07:02,940
[SPEAKER_05]: You said the capability is there.

98
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,242
[SPEAKER_05]: There are all kinds of features that have come in.

99
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:12,945
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the top requested features is the ability to download from the marketplace in the background, so we're looking at it and prioritizing that list of requests.

100
00:07:14,145 --> 00:07:16,747
[SPEAKER_05]: You basically didn't comment on anything in particular.

101
00:07:16,787 --> 00:07:25,591
[SPEAKER_05]: They're also talking about their HD specifications, how they want to keep it high, but they're going to keep it in the level that most listeners are focusing on.

102
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:28,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Not listeners, players.

103
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I'm thinking of our listeners.

104
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,360
[SPEAKER_05]: I love you all.

105
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

106
00:07:35,561 --> 00:07:43,062
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's also mentioned consideration of Blu-ray, but I don't know that they're necessarily going to be looking into it.

107
00:07:44,023 --> 00:07:47,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, I'm tired of hearing about all the Blu-ray rumors.

108
00:07:47,343 --> 00:07:49,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Versus HD DVD and blah blah blah.

109
00:07:49,404 --> 00:07:49,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

110
00:07:50,844 --> 00:07:55,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, something that we did touch on earlier, there are going to be

111
00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:57,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Mega Drive Games on the Revolution

112
00:08:07,677 --> 00:08:12,400
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are going to be seeing Genesis Mega Drive games on the Revolution available.

113
00:08:12,881 --> 00:08:15,782
[SPEAKER_05]: They call it the Virtual Console.

114
00:08:16,503 --> 00:08:25,089
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll feature NES Super Nintendo games, TurboGrafx, and backwards compatible GameCube through the disk drive.

115
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,010
[SPEAKER_05]: But Sega...

116
00:08:28,514 --> 00:08:33,196
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually have a quote from Nalia Tsurumi, who is the CEO of Sega America and Sega Europe.

117
00:08:34,116 --> 00:08:40,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Sega's support of the virtual console system will introduce more gamers to the classic Mega Drive hits and reinvigorate many of our popular brands.

118
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,219
[SPEAKER_08]: That's interesting.

119
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:43,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, why did they release it with two separate names?

120
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Why did they rebrand it the Genesis here?

121
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:45,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know?

122
00:08:45,781 --> 00:08:47,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I didn't follow that whole saga.

123
00:08:47,362 --> 00:08:48,042
[SPEAKER_08]: This was years ago.

124
00:08:48,382 --> 00:08:48,882
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

125
00:08:49,002 --> 00:08:51,323
[SPEAKER_05]: It has to be part of a marketing deal or whatever.

126
00:08:52,383 --> 00:08:54,244
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, Sega CD was the Mega CD.

127
00:08:55,945 --> 00:08:56,345
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just

128
00:08:57,331 --> 00:08:58,451
[SPEAKER_08]: How they did it, alright, whatever.

129
00:09:00,692 --> 00:09:05,014
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're up, folks, whenever we're talking about, you know, hooray, Sega Genesis games are compatible.

130
00:09:05,514 --> 00:09:08,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Just know that for you, replace Genesis with Mega Drive, and you're good.

131
00:09:08,895 --> 00:09:10,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, Sega does what Nintendo does.

132
00:09:10,776 --> 00:09:11,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, stop.

133
00:09:11,356 --> 00:09:11,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on.

134
00:09:13,517 --> 00:09:14,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess what game's going to be on the DS?

135
00:09:16,173 --> 00:09:18,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I already know because I looked at the outline for tonight.

136
00:09:19,135 --> 00:09:20,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Play along!

137
00:09:21,157 --> 00:09:22,659
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, DarkSakura.

138
00:09:22,699 --> 00:09:24,661
[SPEAKER_08]: What game will be playable on the DS?

139
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:25,441
[SPEAKER_05]: A gun game!

140
00:09:25,622 --> 00:09:26,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, right.

141
00:09:26,142 --> 00:09:26,562
[SPEAKER_08]: I like guns.

142
00:09:26,582 --> 00:09:27,103
[SPEAKER_05]: But not really.

143
00:09:28,144 --> 00:09:30,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Point Blank is going to be out on the DS.

144
00:09:31,067 --> 00:09:32,728
[SPEAKER_08]: I was hoping for Wild Gunman.

145
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:34,550
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I won't.

146
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Hogan's Alley.

147
00:09:35,411 --> 00:09:36,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Gangster Town.

148
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:36,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

149
00:09:36,812 --> 00:09:39,415
[SPEAKER_05]: From the Master System since we've been talking about Sega.

150
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:40,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Point Blank was cool, too.

151
00:09:41,526 --> 00:09:42,587
[SPEAKER_05]: I really dig Point Blank.

152
00:09:43,048 --> 00:09:46,031
[SPEAKER_05]: But basically, instead of using the light gun, you're going to use the stylus.

153
00:09:46,071 --> 00:09:46,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Tap on the screen.

154
00:09:47,312 --> 00:09:48,813
[SPEAKER_05]: You have your arcade mode.

155
00:09:49,934 --> 00:09:55,860
[SPEAKER_05]: You have 40 different sequences that are going to be coming up from the arcade in the PlayStation games.

156
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:00,825
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll shoot clay pigeons, cardboard cutouts, aliens, everything.

157
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:02,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Little bouncing balls.

158
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:03,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Pac-Man, not really.

159
00:10:04,601 --> 00:10:04,981
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

160
00:10:05,341 --> 00:10:12,328
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a wireless multiplayer mode that's going to work with one card, a high score free play mode, a few others.

161
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:20,175
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be a mode called Brain Massage, which analyzes and offers feedback as you play.

162
00:10:21,136 --> 00:10:22,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Brain training, anyone?

163
00:10:22,857 --> 00:10:24,579
[SPEAKER_05]: The other is called Games Museum.

164
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of on the wording there, but...

165
00:10:30,043 --> 00:10:34,966
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically adapted older point-blank levels.

166
00:10:35,326 --> 00:10:36,967
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's kind of an interesting concept.

167
00:10:36,987 --> 00:10:41,010
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm surprised we haven't seen this yet, or at least if it's been out, I haven't heard of it, so sorry.

168
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Like a gun game with the stylus.

169
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:46,713
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kind of surprised it's taken us this long to get there.

170
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:53,538
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'd like to see is the Gun Survivor series, the Biohazard Gun Survivor series with the stylus.

171
00:10:54,819 --> 00:11:08,195
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I actually really enjoyed playing, because when we went to Las Vegas way back when on the DDR Freak Moderator's trip, I got to play Biohazard Gun Survivor 2, which was the one set in the Code Veronica universe, and that was cool.

172
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,557
[SPEAKER_05]: It was always, you controlled it with the gun.

173
00:11:10,778 --> 00:11:10,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

174
00:11:11,536 --> 00:11:18,558
[SPEAKER_05]: I always thought they should have a game like that on the DS where you're controlling it and then using your D-pad to shoot too.

175
00:11:18,859 --> 00:11:21,660
[SPEAKER_05]: But no one ever listens to my suggestions in the video game industry.

176
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:27,542
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a GunCon, which is strange because I usually don't collect a lot of the accessories, but I did have a GunCon.

177
00:11:27,582 --> 00:11:28,242
[SPEAKER_08]: I like Point Blank.

178
00:11:28,282 --> 00:11:29,462
[SPEAKER_05]: I have my GunCon too.

179
00:11:31,283 --> 00:11:34,864
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually have the upgraded GunCon because I wanted to get Vampire Knight.

180
00:11:35,785 --> 00:11:36,225
[SPEAKER_05]: I never did.

181
00:11:36,785 --> 00:11:37,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh well.

182
00:11:38,405 --> 00:11:39,946
[SPEAKER_05]: And besides that, it's all about House of the Dead.

183
00:11:41,207 --> 00:11:43,568
[SPEAKER_05]: So, there's a little bit more.

184
00:11:44,828 --> 00:11:54,570
[SPEAKER_05]: There was an announcement by Nintendo and British Telecom saying that there are going to be over 600 Wi-Fi hotspots for the DS and other Wi-Fi capable units.

185
00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:06,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo UK and BT Open Zone announced that they are going to have these hotspots open up to retailers across the UK and Ireland.

186
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:15,724
[SPEAKER_05]: The hotspots are going to provide these retailers and their customers with ways to use the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection service.

187
00:12:17,106 --> 00:12:24,596
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also going to be different playable demos, movies of upcoming titles, sort of how we saw at E3.

188
00:12:25,754 --> 00:12:29,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Game, GameStation, HMV, Toys R Us, Smith's Toys, and other different retailers across the area.

189
00:12:29,157 --> 00:12:31,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Games to be initially included in downloads, Polarium, Meteos, and

190
00:12:46,704 --> 00:12:49,125
[SPEAKER_05]: You get to meet Miyamoto's Nintendog Pick.

191
00:12:50,805 --> 00:12:52,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Upcoming downloads in April and May.

192
00:12:52,565 --> 00:13:02,567
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to be Pokemon Link, Trauma Center Under the Knife, Dr. Kalashima's Brain Training, How Old is Your Brain, other playables.

193
00:13:02,607 --> 00:13:09,689
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be special items for Animal Crossing and a special Metroid Prime Hunters movie.

194
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,268
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

195
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:36,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Wi-Fi is cool and all.

196
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:43,272
[SPEAKER_08]: There's something about having that feedback in person of somebody going, Oh, you bastard, you killed me.

197
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:47,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep in mind those demos only stay on your system as long as your system is not turned off.

198
00:13:47,754 --> 00:13:48,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's true.

199
00:13:49,874 --> 00:13:52,275
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember E3, we downloaded the Meteos demo.

200
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:56,617
[SPEAKER_08]: My buddy Brad and I downloaded the Meteos demo, went back to the hotel that night and played all night long.

201
00:13:56,697 --> 00:13:57,197
[SPEAKER_08]: It was awesome.

202
00:13:57,297 --> 00:13:59,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, see, I actually downloaded Electroplankton.

203
00:14:00,442 --> 00:14:01,703
[SPEAKER_08]: See, I was never able to get that game.

204
00:14:01,723 --> 00:14:03,223
[SPEAKER_08]: I was never ever able to get that game.

205
00:14:03,323 --> 00:14:05,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, it was always full whenever I tried to grab it.

206
00:14:05,204 --> 00:14:08,205
[SPEAKER_05]: I was playing Electroplankton in the line to get into the PlayStation 3.

207
00:14:08,245 --> 00:14:10,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, that's cool.

208
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:18,649
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that, you know, it's a really cool thing, I think, that Nintendo's doing by having all these various hot spots.

209
00:14:19,789 --> 00:14:29,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Not only is it opening more places for gamers to get the new stuff as it comes out, making it available, it's offering more interactivity among gamers, I think.

210
00:14:30,499 --> 00:14:40,542
[SPEAKER_05]: The closest thing I've seen to this, besides of course those game cafes, is I was at a coffee shop not too long ago and saw three people with a laptop playing Quake.

211
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,924
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.

212
00:14:44,024 --> 00:14:53,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, not to say it's the very least, but we have the last segment in our UK news, which is release date!

213
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:56,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, what kind of cool stuff is coming out for the UK folks?

214
00:14:57,387 --> 00:15:01,431
[SPEAKER_05]: On the 30th, we have Brick Amal and Funny Cards on the Game Boy Advance.

215
00:15:01,691 --> 00:15:04,253
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Animal Crossing coming out on the 31st.

216
00:15:04,674 --> 00:15:05,394
[SPEAKER_08]: About time.

217
00:15:06,075 --> 00:15:11,459
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I really hope that the friend code thing works internationally because I've got a bunch of people on there.

218
00:15:11,479 --> 00:15:13,221
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be making room for new people.

219
00:15:14,082 --> 00:15:16,063
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd definitely like to play with some of our UK listeners.

220
00:15:16,784 --> 00:15:21,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Armored Core 9 Breaker on PS2, Battle of Europe, Condemned Criminal Origins.

221
00:15:22,469 --> 00:15:23,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Condemned is a pretty neat game.

222
00:15:24,036 --> 00:15:49,408
[SPEAKER_05]: CSI, Three Dimensions of Murder, Desperados 2, Far Cry, Instincts Evolution, and Predator Ice Age 2, the Meltdown video game, we have Odama, Outrun 2006, love Outrun Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney, grab it while you can Resident Evil, Deadly Silence, Tales of Fantasia, which actually excites me That's where all our copies of Phoenix Wright went, they went over to Europe

223
00:15:51,722 --> 00:15:57,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, there's a tie three, Night of the Quincon, and Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter.

224
00:15:58,874 --> 00:15:59,154
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

225
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:00,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.

226
00:16:00,777 --> 00:16:02,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of stuff to look forward to over there in the UK.

227
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of good stuff.

228
00:16:03,602 --> 00:16:03,862
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

229
00:16:04,002 --> 00:16:04,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Outrun.

230
00:16:05,261 --> 00:16:05,981
[SPEAKER_08]: How about the U.S.?

231
00:16:06,282 --> 00:16:07,402
[SPEAKER_08]: What's coming up in the U.S.?

232
00:16:08,723 --> 00:16:09,843
[SPEAKER_08]: Fun stuff, of course.

233
00:16:10,343 --> 00:16:12,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course we've got... Kingdom Hearts 2 and Beatmania.

234
00:16:13,084 --> 00:16:15,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Kingdom Hearts 2 and Beatmania.

235
00:16:15,165 --> 00:16:16,026
[SPEAKER_09]: That's on my list, yes.

236
00:16:16,986 --> 00:16:19,447
[SPEAKER_09]: We do have some other games, of course.

237
00:16:20,207 --> 00:16:22,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Far Cry Instinct's Predator, if you're having a 360.

238
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:28,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Rumble Roses XX, which should be girl-tastic.

239
00:16:28,591 --> 00:16:33,813
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's also going to be Full Spectrum Warrior 10 Hammers on PlayStation 2 and Xbox.

240
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:35,591
[SPEAKER_09]: GameCubeFans

241
00:17:03,925 --> 00:17:05,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Harvest Moon Magic Melody.

242
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:08,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Yet another Harvest Moon game.

243
00:17:08,234 --> 00:17:09,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Cows and sheep and puppies.

244
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:13,865
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't hear a lot about GameCube games anymore, which is kind of sad.

245
00:17:13,885 --> 00:17:14,646
[SPEAKER_08]: About two a month.

246
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:15,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Too bad.

247
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:30,691
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Launch Radio started as a station dedicated to music and rhythm video games, so of course we like to keep tabs on what's going on in that scene, because of course a lot of our listeners that have been listening to us for the four years we've been going expect it once in a while.

248
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:31,791
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to talk about music news.

249
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:35,473
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Loki, some news going on with In The Groove this week, right?

250
00:17:35,794 --> 00:17:39,155
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, In The Groove is having their PC beta right now.

251
00:17:39,656 --> 00:17:45,759
[SPEAKER_09]: You can actually go download it off their beta website and you can play a two-song demo.

252
00:17:47,461 --> 00:17:50,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, haven't I played this beta before when it was called Stepmania?

253
00:17:51,485 --> 00:17:52,285
[SPEAKER_09]: You may have.

254
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:53,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Just curious.

255
00:17:53,827 --> 00:17:59,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Ironically enough, I did poke around the data files on there, and yep, it is Stepmania.

256
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:11,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, to set this up for folks who may not know what we're talking about here, In the Groove is a DDR-like game that came out, and it's based off a PC...

257
00:18:12,546 --> 00:18:16,229
[SPEAKER_08]: simulator for DDR that's a few years old called Stepmania.

258
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:20,411
[SPEAKER_08]: They got together with the folks that made Stepmania and out came In The Groove.

259
00:18:20,731 --> 00:18:41,385
[SPEAKER_09]: But now you're saying when you poked around these files, you found that... Okay, basically the way it is set up here, they have, instead of having all your sim files and everything in there, they have a directory of pack files or PCK files, and there's one file that's an index file for that that basically tells the program how to unzip everything and extract it so you can play it.

260
00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:46,751
[SPEAKER_09]: And that way you can't go and mess around the files because they're encrypted and compressed.

261
00:18:47,591 --> 00:18:50,612
[SPEAKER_09]: But when you look at the index file, you notice a couple things.

262
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:58,094
[SPEAKER_09]: First off, they actually have .sm on the files.

263
00:18:58,455 --> 00:19:04,557
[SPEAKER_09]: And the best part about this, you know how they have in StepMania when you're doing edits and stuff, and it'll have...

264
00:19:06,806 --> 00:19:10,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Your directory, your folder, you can switch between different folders and stuff to edit songs.

265
00:19:10,928 --> 00:19:14,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they still left it in there in the Groove Beta.

266
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:21,114
[SPEAKER_09]: They left in the folder stuff so you can actually see what looks exactly like the StepMania step editor.

267
00:19:21,914 --> 00:19:24,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, this is an early build, though, right?

268
00:19:24,756 --> 00:19:26,317
[SPEAKER_08]: They may take some of this out or what?

269
00:19:26,497 --> 00:19:29,299
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess they could, but... Or it could be a marketing tool.

270
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:30,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, make your own songs.

271
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:33,441
[SPEAKER_09]: I just hope they're playing non-selling this because I don't see the point.

272
00:19:34,394 --> 00:19:37,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, DDR came out on the PC and a lot of people didn't see the point of that.

273
00:19:37,821 --> 00:19:44,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but it's not based on a game that's been out there already or a program that's been out there already that's free.

274
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:50,081
[SPEAKER_08]: You know actually how I think that Rockstar could sell more copies of this?

275
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Make this PC release coming up.

276
00:19:52,422 --> 00:19:53,683
[SPEAKER_08]: If they're doing this, make it into Groove 2.

277
00:19:54,283 --> 00:19:56,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Release it for the PC before you release it on consoles.

278
00:19:56,824 --> 00:19:58,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Some people will buy them both, just to have them both.

279
00:19:58,745 --> 00:20:00,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's the cool thing about it.

280
00:20:00,846 --> 00:20:07,049
[SPEAKER_09]: You can make edits and transfer them to USB drive, so you can actually go and play your edits on the arcade.

281
00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:12,512
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess that's kind of cool, but I think you can pretty much do that anyways if you have step mania.

282
00:20:13,499 --> 00:20:15,040
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's a way to do it, yeah.

283
00:20:15,301 --> 00:20:17,542
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I don't know.

284
00:20:18,323 --> 00:20:29,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well, remember, remember, we are, and some of our listeners, too, our listeners that are music game oriented, put yourself in these shoes, we are a minority of the gaming public at large.

285
00:20:29,672 --> 00:20:42,162
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of the gaming public has no idea that Stepmania even exists, and when they see this on store shelves, I might be a parent buying this for my kid going, oh, I want my kid to get fit, and I don't have a console, but I have a PC.

286
00:20:43,022 --> 00:20:45,283
[SPEAKER_08]: So, that's where this game's going to sell.

287
00:20:45,343 --> 00:20:47,083
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's going to really sell amongst the hardcore.

288
00:20:47,103 --> 00:20:47,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me put it this way.

289
00:20:48,723 --> 00:20:49,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Same thing with DDR.

290
00:20:49,424 --> 00:20:51,204
[SPEAKER_08]: I always said the exact same thing about DDR PC.

291
00:20:52,344 --> 00:20:57,366
[SPEAKER_08]: The only reason to have that... I mean, it's a crappy release compared to most of the console ones.

292
00:20:57,606 --> 00:21:07,948
[SPEAKER_08]: The only reason to have it is for... A, all the downloadable characters, like Mr. Spanky, and B, to have it on the PC when you don't have a console in your house.

293
00:21:08,008 --> 00:21:10,189
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, if you're a family that doesn't have a console in your house.

294
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:11,589
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I mean, it's just...

295
00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:15,771
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very lazy to me, to be honest.

296
00:21:15,931 --> 00:21:23,774
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, it's just... Well, if you're willing to check it out, if you want to check it out, here's where you gotta go.

297
00:21:23,934 --> 00:21:35,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Just go to www.inthegroove.com slash page slash ITG underscore PC underscore Mac underscore demo underscore beta.

298
00:21:35,948 --> 00:21:37,169
[SPEAKER_09]: if that's easy enough for you guys.

299
00:21:37,649 --> 00:21:49,719
[SPEAKER_09]: And you'll fill out a nice little survey and you'll download a torrent file where you can download the actual beta, which might take a little bit of time because apparently the torrent speeds are pretty slow.

300
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:52,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Mine went pretty quick, but I don't know.

301
00:21:52,221 --> 00:21:58,045
[SPEAKER_09]: I played it and immediately when I played the game, I tried it out to see if it's anything special.

302
00:21:58,886 --> 00:22:01,228
[SPEAKER_09]: It just reinforced the fact why I don't like In the Groove.

303
00:22:01,308 --> 00:22:03,370
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I don't know.

304
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead, check it out.

305
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,111
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

306
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:40,798
[SPEAKER_08]: But now what may be a little bit of a surprise is that if you trace the big corporate structure, Sony somewhat funds the Spider-Man franchise, so you would think it would be a PS3 exclusive, but not really.

307
00:22:40,878 --> 00:22:41,739
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not the way it's going to go.

308
00:22:41,779 --> 00:22:45,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Where there's money to be made, they will release the games.

309
00:22:46,123 --> 00:22:46,883
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's that.

310
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:52,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, you also have another release news information?

311
00:22:52,488 --> 00:22:53,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, 99 Nights.

312
00:22:54,096 --> 00:23:01,300
[SPEAKER_09]: which is another kind of Dynasty Warriors-ish game that's out in Japan right now is going to be coming to the US in the fall.

313
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:02,801
[SPEAKER_09]: And that should be pretty cool.

314
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks like a pretty decent game.

315
00:23:04,762 --> 00:23:06,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that mean we'll finally get the demo one of these days?

316
00:23:08,064 --> 00:23:11,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, well, actually the demo just needs to hit on live.

317
00:23:11,425 --> 00:23:16,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now they're just offering it as like on the CD only or DVD only.

318
00:23:16,508 --> 00:23:21,631
[SPEAKER_09]: So as soon as that hits on live, then yeah, you can actually probably play the demo here in the States.

319
00:23:21,731 --> 00:23:23,652
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't know.

320
00:23:24,181 --> 00:23:25,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Until then, we just need more games.

321
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:46,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on, we're going to get into another story here.

322
00:23:46,484 --> 00:23:48,966
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, you have another release information.

323
00:23:49,307 --> 00:23:50,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I do.

324
00:23:50,448 --> 00:23:52,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Normally, I hold off.

325
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:55,833
[SPEAKER_05]: I only mention the releases that are coming out in the following week.

326
00:23:56,194 --> 00:24:03,581
[SPEAKER_05]: For the UK releases, I do have one to add, though, that was brought to my attention by our long-time listener, Simmel, who's actually listening right now at 4, 5, 6 a.m.

327
00:24:06,001 --> 00:24:06,601
[SPEAKER_08]: That's hardcore.

328
00:24:06,761 --> 00:24:08,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that is hardcore.

329
00:24:09,403 --> 00:24:13,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Guitar Hero is actually getting a UK release on 7th of April for £50.

330
00:24:15,557 --> 00:24:19,080
[SPEAKER_08]: It's getting a lot, a lot, it still gets a lot, a lot of coverage.

331
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's expensive here too.

332
00:24:20,701 --> 00:24:24,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm almost... But that comparably is more expensive than it was here.

333
00:24:25,444 --> 00:24:40,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't get me wrong, I think Guitar Hero is a great game, but at the same time, I'm really starting to get sick of hearing about it all the time, and how revolutionary it is when you kind of think... Keep in mind, we've had it for a while, they haven't had it yet, they're

334
00:24:40,782 --> 00:24:41,302
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I know, no, no.

335
00:24:43,103 --> 00:24:47,124
[SPEAKER_08]: The mention of this makes me think about how saturated Guitar Hero is over here right now.

336
00:24:47,724 --> 00:24:54,786
[SPEAKER_08]: And don't get me wrong, it's a great game and all, but, you know, it doesn't... It's not that revolutionary.

337
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:59,648
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not that revolutionary to me, because we've had Guitar Freaks, we've had Frequency, we've had Amplitude.

338
00:25:01,248 --> 00:25:07,710
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing that kind of sold this game was the fun element of it and the way they kind of tied it all together.

339
00:25:08,186 --> 00:25:18,341
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad that it is coming out of here because I feel a lot of people have missed out on it because I really enjoy it.

340
00:25:18,662 --> 00:25:19,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Got our second guitar now.

341
00:25:21,684 --> 00:25:24,227
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, I've seen that they sell the guitars separately, too.

342
00:25:24,247 --> 00:25:26,490
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a red one that costs like $10 more.

343
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:30,675
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet Konami's kicking their butts right now for not releasing Guitar Freaks here a couple years ago.

344
00:25:31,115 --> 00:25:34,279
[SPEAKER_08]: Should have had more faith in music games over here, Konami Japan.

345
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:39,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, there's another game that we're going to be seeing at E3.

346
00:25:40,527 --> 00:25:40,827
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that?

347
00:25:41,175 --> 00:25:48,438
[SPEAKER_05]: BioWare is going to have some stuff out for an Xbox 360 RPG called Mass Effect.

348
00:25:50,139 --> 00:26:03,706
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're saying, though, it's speculated either this year or next, it's going to have players who form bands of adventurers and go on and, you know, kick alien butt in the future.

349
00:26:04,526 --> 00:26:06,507
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, go around different planets, explore them.

350
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:07,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Pillage as you roam!

351
00:26:09,129 --> 00:26:11,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to different solar systems, different places.

352
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:27,621
[SPEAKER_05]: BioWare spoke to IGN during the Game Developers Conference and said that prior to the battles, which are going to be in real time, players can get together and make strategies, can swap characters when the fights go on.

353
00:26:29,622 --> 00:26:35,406
[SPEAKER_05]: You have your different types of characters, your typical ones, like your long, short range, your healer, blah, blah, blah.

354
00:26:36,064 --> 00:26:38,586
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

355
00:27:03,499 --> 00:27:04,299
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, I know, it's great.

356
00:27:04,479 --> 00:27:10,702
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, because I'm crossing my fingers and my toes that we are going to get the media thing after all, so we get to go in a little bit early.

357
00:27:11,283 --> 00:27:16,805
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm thinking, I'm pretty much going to burn that time waiting in line for Nintendo Revolution, because I know that is the first place I want to go.

358
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:17,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Press doesn't have to wait.

359
00:27:18,286 --> 00:27:18,606
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we don't.

360
00:27:20,595 --> 00:27:21,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Shit, cool.

361
00:27:22,956 --> 00:27:23,376
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know.

362
00:27:23,577 --> 00:27:24,197
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm hoping.

363
00:27:24,277 --> 00:27:29,099
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm crossing my fingers and my toes we get to see it because I really want to share with you guys all about that.

364
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:31,440
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, we will be broadcasting from E3.

365
00:27:31,881 --> 00:27:36,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Still working out some details, but you can look forward to daily podcasts just like we did last year.

366
00:27:36,663 --> 00:27:38,084
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to be able to broadcast.

367
00:27:38,384 --> 00:27:39,684
[SPEAKER_09]: I told you so.

368
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:40,745
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I'm hoping.

369
00:27:40,765 --> 00:27:44,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the listeners might be the ones broadcasting back to you, buddy.

370
00:27:44,327 --> 00:27:45,147
[SPEAKER_08]: You better be careful.

371
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:48,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, anyway, moving on to another story.

372
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,962
[SPEAKER_08]: You were talking in the first half, Loki, about you've been playing Elder Scrolls for Oblivion.

373
00:27:52,322 --> 00:27:54,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, the game's already broken.

374
00:27:54,943 --> 00:27:59,625
[SPEAKER_08]: You were talking about a bug earlier where you couldn't jump in a certain point of the game.

375
00:27:59,986 --> 00:28:02,847
[SPEAKER_08]: You stuck because you were floating on a rock or something.

376
00:28:03,147 --> 00:28:04,868
[SPEAKER_08]: But what else is broken in Oblivion?

377
00:28:05,668 --> 00:28:14,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, sometimes the load times tend to be extremely long, and this is because the hard drive, it caches the game to the hard drive so that it

378
00:28:14,805 --> 00:28:18,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Loads faster and plays faster, but sometimes it gets fragmented.

379
00:28:19,149 --> 00:28:25,214
[SPEAKER_09]: However, at least they figured out that that's possible and what they did is built in a fix for it.

380
00:28:25,274 --> 00:28:39,967
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you do have that happen where your load times are excruciatingly long, what you need to do is actually hold down the A button when you reset the game and let it boot up to the title screen and that's it.

381
00:28:40,768 --> 00:28:42,129
[SPEAKER_09]: So, pretty simple, but...

382
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,151
[SPEAKER_09]: Dark Sakura Dark Sakura Dark Sakura

383
00:29:21,815 --> 00:29:47,992
[SPEAKER_05]: The review of the week goes to Tequila Oh Tequila, how you make me suffer You make my stomach hurt worse than anything in the universe ever does Anything less than Patron is not worth drinking Oh how I hate thee Dear Tequila, die Not love, DarkSakura Alright, I'm laughing because I was there that night You were there

384
00:29:50,562 --> 00:29:55,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Also an F you to cheap sour mix, but mostly to cheap tequila.

385
00:29:56,827 --> 00:30:02,111
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what, Jason was telling me that he's regretting not taking pictures of you passed out because it would have been pretty funny now.

386
00:30:02,431 --> 00:30:02,712
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

387
00:30:03,752 --> 00:30:04,833
[SPEAKER_04]: I, okay, you know.

388
00:30:04,873 --> 00:30:08,436
[SPEAKER_08]: He didn't get any, but he told me he regrets not taking any.

389
00:30:08,736 --> 00:30:08,976
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

390
00:30:10,317 --> 00:30:11,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I, alright.

391
00:30:11,478 --> 00:30:13,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Admit it, it would be funny in context.

392
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,383
[SPEAKER_05]: To explain, I have insanely good alcohol tolerance.

393
00:30:18,172 --> 00:30:21,674
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I have zero tolerance when it comes to cheap tequila.

394
00:30:22,014 --> 00:30:31,378
[SPEAKER_05]: On top of it, I think I'm somewhat allergic to it because I woke up with a rash on my neck, which I only get a rash on my neck if I've had something, if I've consumed something I'm allergic to.

395
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:33,560
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think I'm allergic to tequila.

396
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,021
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we haven't done a drunk show in a while.

397
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:36,361
No.

398
00:30:37,003 --> 00:30:37,844
[SPEAKER_08]: Get off your high horse, asshole.

399
00:31:04,023 --> 00:31:04,284
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

400
00:31:04,384 --> 00:31:06,086
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a designated driver to pick me up every time.

401
00:31:06,186 --> 00:31:06,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Always.

402
00:31:06,786 --> 00:31:07,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Always.

403
00:31:07,327 --> 00:31:08,248
[SPEAKER_08]: We do it safe.

404
00:31:08,308 --> 00:31:09,329
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I don't know.

405
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:09,970
[SPEAKER_08]: I just had to get that.

406
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:10,971
[SPEAKER_08]: That's another FU.

407
00:31:11,191 --> 00:31:11,632
[SPEAKER_08]: FU to a...

408
00:31:13,132 --> 00:31:25,285
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually am here, but as far as my, I've been, you've seen me drink on the show, and the one time I got sick on the show from drinking was with that cheap tequila that was sitting on top of your refrigerator at the old apartment.

409
00:31:25,525 --> 00:31:26,666
[SPEAKER_05]: That stuff was nasty.

410
00:31:26,686 --> 00:31:27,527
[SPEAKER_05]: What was cheap?

411
00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:32,332
[SPEAKER_05]: I was drinking that tequila, and I finished, what, a fourth of the bottle?

412
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:34,495
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I got really sick and ate waffles.

413
00:31:35,154 --> 00:31:36,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, thank you, Chatroom.

414
00:31:36,315 --> 00:31:37,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Chatroom makes an excellent point here.

415
00:31:37,536 --> 00:31:40,999
[SPEAKER_08]: GK128 says Dignation was taped at the bar two weeks ago.

416
00:31:41,379 --> 00:31:45,282
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know that This Week in Tech has done shows at pubs and stuff.

417
00:31:45,322 --> 00:31:48,885
[SPEAKER_08]: So that guy can go take a flying leap.

418
00:31:49,145 --> 00:31:50,006
[SPEAKER_05]: What channel was it?

419
00:31:50,066 --> 00:32:03,497
[SPEAKER_05]: I was watching a show where it was like some science experiment show where they had people going out and taking them to the pub to get smashed off their butt and then go the next day and find out what was the best hangover cure.

420
00:32:06,222 --> 00:32:07,203
[SPEAKER_08]: We always set limits.

421
00:32:07,423 --> 00:32:08,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Be safe about it.

422
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:11,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's expensive.

423
00:32:11,305 --> 00:32:13,406
[SPEAKER_08]: I think now we have to set a date to do another one.

424
00:32:13,446 --> 00:32:14,947
[SPEAKER_08]: Just defy these negative reviews.

425
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:16,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's fight our next three-day weekend.

426
00:32:16,248 --> 00:32:21,912
[SPEAKER_08]: And reaffirm our independence from these corporate non-drinking entities.

427
00:32:22,332 --> 00:32:22,732
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

428
00:32:22,752 --> 00:32:28,516
[SPEAKER_05]: The only way for me to actually be significantly drunk on the show is if I put down the $16 and get a couple bottles of Chimay.

429
00:32:28,556 --> 00:32:30,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, then we'll just all have to chip in and make it happen.

430
00:32:30,978 --> 00:32:31,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm going to.

431
00:32:32,412 --> 00:32:36,255
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the, uh, for the record, that is the only beer that will have me drunk in one pint.

432
00:32:36,435 --> 00:32:37,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we gotta keep moving, we gotta keep moving.

433
00:32:37,616 --> 00:32:38,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get to the game segments.

434
00:32:38,497 --> 00:32:39,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, Loki, you're FU real quick.

435
00:32:40,579 --> 00:32:46,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, just a stupid driver, because I've seen too many people today, like, going in the wrong direction on the road.

436
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:49,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Was it like, you know, when we're at lunch?

437
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:50,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you sure you just weren't playing a lot of Mario?

438
00:32:50,607 --> 00:32:54,170
[SPEAKER_08]: No, when we're going, when we're at lunch, you know, the women trying to back up.

439
00:32:54,691 --> 00:32:56,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, the, the chick that was trying to back up.

440
00:32:56,632 --> 00:32:57,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, that was, that was kind of crazy.

441
00:32:58,174 --> 00:32:59,495
[SPEAKER_09]: And just, you know, I don't know.

442
00:33:01,317 --> 00:33:27,150
[SPEAKER_08]: my F you would have to be having to be sober while everyone else I was with literally everyone I was with Friday night was drunk but I had to be sober because it's very responsible to have a sober driver but next time it will not be me mark my words it will not be me next time somebody else gets to play alright that's it moving on next segment

443
00:33:28,896 --> 00:33:31,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Our next story, we're going to go over to me.

444
00:33:32,879 --> 00:33:35,221
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're going to talk about the Video Game Voter Network.

445
00:33:35,261 --> 00:33:37,702
[SPEAKER_08]: We mentioned this on a previous podcast last week.

446
00:33:37,722 --> 00:33:39,183
[SPEAKER_08]: We were talking about the Video Game Voters Network.

447
00:33:39,543 --> 00:33:40,264
[SPEAKER_08]: It just launched.

448
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:41,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, get this.

449
00:33:42,726 --> 00:33:44,767
[SPEAKER_08]: 20,000 messages were sent to U.S.

450
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:47,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Senators in just a week of this network being up.

451
00:33:47,949 --> 00:33:50,991
[SPEAKER_08]: So you guys really took action on this really quickly.

452
00:33:51,491 --> 00:33:56,495
[SPEAKER_08]: And, of course, something we may not have mentioned last week because it wasn't exactly clear to us at that time...

453
00:33:56,955 --> 00:33:58,736
[SPEAKER_08]: But the ESA does have a hand in this.

454
00:33:58,776 --> 00:34:06,219
[SPEAKER_08]: This is, I believe, the ESA, kind of their response to all this stuff going on is to really mobilize the gaming community.

455
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,040
[SPEAKER_08]: But I stand by what I said last week.

456
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:12,322
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a smart idea, and if you're sick of all this stuff, you've got to do something about it, right?

457
00:34:12,362 --> 00:34:15,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like the kid we were talking about in the first half that was getting sued.

458
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:17,505
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to make change, you've got to do something about it.

459
00:34:17,985 --> 00:34:22,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, what I thought was interesting is that on the site now, they actually have a letter from Will Wright.

460
00:34:23,368 --> 00:34:24,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Will Wright, of course, made...

461
00:34:25,234 --> 00:34:26,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Many, many classic games.

462
00:34:26,675 --> 00:34:28,375
[SPEAKER_08]: He's working on that Spore thing now.

463
00:34:28,415 --> 00:34:30,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is freaking awesome.

464
00:34:30,176 --> 00:34:32,336
[SPEAKER_08]: This hugely comprehensive game.

465
00:34:32,416 --> 00:34:33,577
[SPEAKER_08]: This is going to be insane.

466
00:34:34,977 --> 00:34:38,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Will Wright actually posted a letter to the site there urging people to join.

467
00:34:38,478 --> 00:34:45,201
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you don't want to join Video Game Voters Network because we told you to, then consider Will Wright's opinion for a minute.

468
00:34:45,441 --> 00:34:47,201
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that man's made a lot of great stuff.

469
00:34:48,942 --> 00:34:51,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's go over now to...

470
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:57,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, who has a story speaking of legal things.

471
00:34:57,533 --> 00:35:01,554
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got to file patents when you're going to do new stuff, and sometimes it tells us what's coming up.

472
00:35:01,614 --> 00:35:02,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, Loki?

473
00:35:02,355 --> 00:35:23,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, well, the story that actually came out this week about the PSP keyboard, it's actually kind of... There was a patent for a keyboard that was going to be used via the USB port on the PSP, which is kind of retarded when you think about it, because that would mean that the keyboard is above the monitor when you're typing, so...

474
00:35:23,806 --> 00:35:25,307
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be completely awkward.

475
00:35:25,887 --> 00:35:28,668
[SPEAKER_09]: But that was one of the things that came out.

476
00:35:28,748 --> 00:35:32,149
[SPEAKER_09]: And they had kind of like a cell phone little doohickey on there.

477
00:35:32,869 --> 00:35:36,391
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know if that's something that they're still working on.

478
00:35:37,151 --> 00:35:43,373
[SPEAKER_09]: But this was actually, I think, shown at E3 a couple years ago, I want to say, when they originally showed the PSP.

479
00:35:43,413 --> 00:35:45,834
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to say that this was one of the things that they showed.

480
00:35:45,934 --> 00:35:48,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Or maybe it was at one of the shows.

481
00:35:48,555 --> 00:35:50,336
[SPEAKER_09]: And they had actual pictures of it that I've seen.

482
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:52,297
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't think it's anything.

483
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:53,877
[SPEAKER_09]: They're probably going to change it some.

484
00:35:54,558 --> 00:35:55,679
[SPEAKER_09]: But that was interesting.

485
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:59,801
[SPEAKER_09]: However, there was another patent, though, that was filed that I thought was pretty interesting.

486
00:36:00,301 --> 00:36:05,865
[SPEAKER_09]: And that would be by Take-Two for Vice City Stories, the next PSP Grand Theft Auto game.

487
00:36:06,185 --> 00:36:06,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Hoo-yah.

488
00:36:08,186 --> 00:36:09,547
[SPEAKER_08]: We think, right?

489
00:36:09,727 --> 00:36:12,749
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's speculation, but they have filed a patent on this name.

490
00:36:12,909 --> 00:36:13,730
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, trademark.

491
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:14,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, trademark on the name.

492
00:36:15,211 --> 00:36:15,991
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't patent a name.

493
00:36:16,011 --> 00:36:17,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, even I should know that.

494
00:36:18,293 --> 00:36:18,913
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, interesting.

495
00:36:20,287 --> 00:36:23,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on, I got a story here on Windows Vista.

496
00:36:24,589 --> 00:36:29,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, this is going to be the next, you know, like XP, the next version of Windows.

497
00:36:29,891 --> 00:36:40,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Get this, if you want to be playing games on Windows Vista, they're saying that you're going to have to have two gigs of RAM in order to play games on Windows Vista.

498
00:36:41,355 --> 00:36:46,737
[SPEAKER_08]: They're saying that 900 meg seems to be the bare minimum to even use like Word or PowerPoint.

499
00:36:47,045 --> 00:36:53,307
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to play Halo 2 or any of that stuff, you're going to have to have 2 gigs of RAM to play on Windows Vista.

500
00:36:54,008 --> 00:37:00,410
[SPEAKER_08]: I suppose a little bit of this is rumor right now, but we'll see for sure when the system comes out.

501
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:07,913
[SPEAKER_08]: All I can say is that I guess I'm glad I did upgrade this system to 2 gigs of RAM, so that if I decide to get Windows Vista, I'll be okay and good to go.

502
00:37:08,573 --> 00:37:10,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki had another quick story on the Vista, though.

503
00:37:10,526 --> 00:37:18,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there was a rumor that it was being reprogrammed, or the code was being reprogrammed by the Xbox team, and that rumor was, of course, debunked.

504
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:21,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Or at least, Microsoft is saying no, that's not the case.

505
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,850
[SPEAKER_09]: So, take it as a rumor.

506
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:23,450
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

507
00:37:24,691 --> 00:37:24,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

508
00:37:25,598 --> 00:37:26,238
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what's interesting?

509
00:37:26,479 --> 00:37:38,146
[SPEAKER_08]: That program that I downloaded onto the computer to allow my Xbox to get the pictures and stuff from the network for my 360, the program actually looks like the Xbox 360 when you launch it.

510
00:37:38,226 --> 00:37:40,127
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes your desktop look like the Xbox 360.

511
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,249
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of cute that they have that consistency going on.

512
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:45,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

513
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:48,394
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really looking forward to getting my Mac now, even more.

514
00:37:50,014 --> 00:37:54,075
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, they do have a program for the Mac that'll let you connect with your 360.

515
00:37:54,335 --> 00:37:56,515
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's called Connect360, I think is the name of it.

516
00:37:57,736 --> 00:38:00,176
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it does everything, but it'll do the songs and stuff.

517
00:38:00,216 --> 00:38:01,316
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it costs money, though.

518
00:38:01,416 --> 00:38:02,777
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if it's totally free.

519
00:38:03,017 --> 00:38:08,178
[SPEAKER_05]: The one thing, though, I'm going to be happy about my Mac is running virtual PC so I can still play Ragnarok.

520
00:38:08,258 --> 00:38:08,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

521
00:38:08,985 --> 00:38:11,326
[SPEAKER_05]: because Ragnarok will run just fine on virtual PC.

522
00:38:12,426 --> 00:38:14,127
[SPEAKER_05]: And then run everything else that I need to.

523
00:38:14,487 --> 00:38:15,747
[SPEAKER_05]: I can play World of Warcraft.

524
00:38:16,508 --> 00:38:19,449
[SPEAKER_05]: I can actually even do podcasting.

525
00:38:19,469 --> 00:38:22,990
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to have to get hooked up with GarageBand, the new one.

526
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:25,431
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very intricate when it comes to podcasting.

527
00:38:25,471 --> 00:38:27,471
[SPEAKER_08]: I've tried to look at what we can do for this show with it.

528
00:38:28,012 --> 00:38:34,974
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also going to start using whatever their broadcaster is for Pump of Volume, which will be this week.

529
00:38:35,626 --> 00:38:36,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Xtifer Xtifer

530
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:06,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Xtifer, did you go to a big deal concert this week?

531
00:39:07,328 --> 00:39:08,209
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I did.

532
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:09,390
[SPEAKER_10]: First off, welcome to the show.

533
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:10,210
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

534
00:39:10,511 --> 00:39:11,892
[SPEAKER_10]: And you guys are speaking of me?

535
00:39:11,972 --> 00:39:13,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, your ears must have been burning.

536
00:39:13,974 --> 00:39:15,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you start sneezing a lot?

537
00:39:16,135 --> 00:39:16,376
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

538
00:39:17,216 --> 00:39:18,918
[SPEAKER_08]: When's your show coming back, your spin-off show?

539
00:39:20,087 --> 00:39:22,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I'm thinking maybe in a couple weeks.

540
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:27,813
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you think we're politically incorrect on this show, oh my gosh, listen to X for a show some night, because he doesn't even really talk about games.

541
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:29,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you ever talk about games on your show?

542
00:39:29,574 --> 00:39:30,755
[SPEAKER_08]: I can talk about video games.

543
00:39:30,775 --> 00:39:32,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well you need to talk about video games tonight.

544
00:39:32,757 --> 00:39:33,437
[SPEAKER_08]: What happened?

545
00:39:33,717 --> 00:39:37,840
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to do something video game related that myself, Loki, DarkSakura, none of us got to do.

546
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,301
[SPEAKER_08]: What did you do?

547
00:39:38,641 --> 00:39:44,666
[SPEAKER_10]: I went to Video Games Live, which was a concert in San Jose that they put on.

548
00:39:46,147 --> 00:39:49,149
[SPEAKER_10]: And basically it's a bunch of video game

549
00:39:50,014 --> 00:39:53,677
[SPEAKER_10]: Music that is live with an orchestra.

550
00:39:55,038 --> 00:39:57,019
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a choir there.

551
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:03,685
[SPEAKER_10]: And also, I guess that one guy from that one show was hosting it.

552
00:40:04,065 --> 00:40:06,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Tommy Tallarico, yeah.

553
00:40:07,067 --> 00:40:13,913
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know all of their names, but I can say that all of the music that they played was very beautiful.

554
00:40:13,973 --> 00:40:17,135
[SPEAKER_10]: They played pieces from World of Warcraft.

555
00:40:17,275 --> 00:40:17,696
[SPEAKER_10]: There was...

556
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:29,519
[SPEAKER_10]: EverQuest 2, there was Kingdom Hearts, there was Zelda, there was Mario, there was Castlevania, apparently there was Metal Gear Solid, which I didn't see because we came in a little bit late.

557
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:30,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Shame on you.

558
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,680
[SPEAKER_08]: So you missed the Pong.

559
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,321
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to know about the Pong.

560
00:40:33,982 --> 00:40:37,504
[SPEAKER_10]: They did Frogger, which wasn't that good.

561
00:40:37,804 --> 00:40:45,229
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard on Bobby Blackwolf's show when he had Tommy Tallarico on that he was saying something about this whole Frogger setup, that they have people play live?

562
00:40:45,469 --> 00:40:46,009
[SPEAKER_08]: What do they do?

563
00:40:46,289 --> 00:40:46,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, um...

564
00:40:47,833 --> 00:40:54,075
[SPEAKER_10]: They were playing the game live, and the conductor was conducting the music as they were playing the game.

565
00:40:54,115 --> 00:40:55,996
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was like you were hearing the live music.

566
00:40:56,076 --> 00:40:59,918
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a very expensive way to play a game, I guess.

567
00:41:01,338 --> 00:41:02,018
[SPEAKER_10]: They joked about it.

568
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:04,499
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, didn't they give somebody a laptop for winning?

569
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:08,961
[SPEAKER_10]: They gave somebody a very nice laptop for winning at Frogger.

570
00:41:09,001 --> 00:41:12,843
[SPEAKER_10]: He wasn't even that good, but he got a very nice laptop.

571
00:41:13,163 --> 00:41:15,183
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what it was called, but it was a very nice laptop.

572
00:41:15,303 --> 00:41:16,144
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it Alienware?

573
00:41:16,164 --> 00:41:16,544
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that it?

574
00:41:16,829 --> 00:41:17,589
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

575
00:41:17,609 --> 00:41:17,909
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

576
00:41:18,149 --> 00:41:19,270
[SPEAKER_10]: But it was very nice.

577
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:20,530
[SPEAKER_05]: I have memories of Frogger.

578
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:22,030
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just weird.

579
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:22,730
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a cool game.

580
00:41:23,091 --> 00:41:28,712
[SPEAKER_05]: I have memories of being in middle school at the roller rink playing Frogger on roller skates.

581
00:41:29,372 --> 00:41:30,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Did any of it make you cry?

582
00:41:31,313 --> 00:41:31,933
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it didn't.

583
00:41:32,893 --> 00:41:33,993
[SPEAKER_10]: I was there with my boyfriend.

584
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,834
[SPEAKER_10]: He was crying a little bit at some things.

585
00:41:36,214 --> 00:41:38,954
[SPEAKER_10]: But no, they were... It was very nice.

586
00:41:38,994 --> 00:41:42,715
[SPEAKER_10]: And we sat like three seats, three aisles from the front.

587
00:41:43,275 --> 00:41:45,656
[SPEAKER_10]: So we had very good seats and...

588
00:41:46,361 --> 00:41:47,481
[SPEAKER_10]: The Conductor was funny.

589
00:41:47,601 --> 00:41:48,602
[SPEAKER_10]: That Tommy guy wasn't.

590
00:41:50,782 --> 00:41:57,204
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, as somebody that doesn't play a lot of video games, I really do like the music.

591
00:41:57,384 --> 00:42:02,805
[SPEAKER_10]: I see it as the same as music from motion pictures because it's just the same thing.

592
00:42:02,865 --> 00:42:06,666
[SPEAKER_10]: It just scores like they are scoring a movie.

593
00:42:07,686 --> 00:42:11,027
[SPEAKER_10]: I've always liked soundtrack music.

594
00:42:11,707 --> 00:42:13,948
[SPEAKER_10]: I was kind of in my own

595
00:42:16,102 --> 00:42:23,288
[SPEAKER_10]: I was very well... I thought it was a very well done thing that they did.

596
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:26,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well thanks for that little mini review of Video Games Live.

597
00:42:27,572 --> 00:42:30,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Now this is touring, so would you recommend our listeners go see it?

598
00:42:30,775 --> 00:42:31,475
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's touring.

599
00:42:31,575 --> 00:42:33,557
[SPEAKER_08]: It was touring and it wasn't touring.

600
00:42:33,737 --> 00:42:35,358
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm pretty sure they'll do more shows of this though.

601
00:42:35,539 --> 00:42:37,620
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think it's really cool.

602
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,081
[SPEAKER_10]: I think a lot of people would be interested.

603
00:42:39,142 --> 00:42:42,304
[SPEAKER_10]: If you like Halo, they did a huge thing from Halo at the end.

604
00:42:42,344 --> 00:42:42,985
[SPEAKER_10]: It was the finale.

605
00:42:43,685 --> 00:42:47,126
[SPEAKER_10]: and they had the actual guy who composed the music that was there.

606
00:42:47,386 --> 00:42:51,147
[SPEAKER_10]: And they also had the guy, they had a lot of video game composers in the audience.

607
00:42:51,207 --> 00:42:57,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know that you were at the show during a really big week in video gaming in Santa Fe, right?

608
00:42:57,428 --> 00:42:57,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, right.

609
00:42:57,869 --> 00:42:58,189
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

610
00:42:58,449 --> 00:43:03,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, apparently they had the big gaming thing in the same place as we went.

611
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:05,010
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

612
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:09,311
[SPEAKER_10]: But they also had the composer to World of Warcraft there.

613
00:43:09,471 --> 00:43:09,852
[SPEAKER_10]: He was there.

614
00:43:10,252 --> 00:43:10,952
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was kind of cool.

615
00:43:11,252 --> 00:43:11,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, cool.

616
00:43:11,532 --> 00:43:11,692
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

617
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:21,184
[SPEAKER_10]: because when you do play games, that's all you ever play I was in my element favorite song that they played all night?

618
00:43:23,825 --> 00:43:40,116
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I would say Advent Rising I've never played the game, I've heard that it's not that good but I thought that the music was gorgeous it's a great game, it just has really horrible frame rate issues so, yeah

619
00:43:40,908 --> 00:43:41,148
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

620
00:43:41,228 --> 00:43:42,209
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe we'll have to check that out.

621
00:43:42,409 --> 00:43:43,630
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it was gorgeous.

622
00:43:44,131 --> 00:43:45,792
[SPEAKER_10]: And Kingdom Hearts was very well done, too.

623
00:43:46,312 --> 00:43:47,873
[SPEAKER_10]: Did they do Simple and Clean from Kingdom Hearts?

624
00:43:48,674 --> 00:43:50,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it was the theme to the first game.

625
00:43:50,335 --> 00:43:50,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's hot.

626
00:43:51,196 --> 00:43:53,818
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, it did have that Simple and Clean theme.

627
00:43:53,858 --> 00:43:54,218
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.

628
00:43:54,899 --> 00:43:55,139
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

629
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:56,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Xfer.

630
00:43:56,241 --> 00:43:56,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Appreciate it.

631
00:43:56,881 --> 00:43:57,742
[SPEAKER_10]: No problemo.

632
00:43:57,982 --> 00:43:58,283
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

633
00:43:58,303 --> 00:44:01,025
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to go over to DarkSakura every week.

634
00:44:01,125 --> 00:44:08,893
[SPEAKER_08]: She climbs the Internet up and down and searches to find a great website to share with you guys as her website of the week.

635
00:44:08,913 --> 00:44:13,036
[SPEAKER_08]: So, DarkSakura, where should the kids be pointing their Firefox browsers to this time?

636
00:44:13,056 --> 00:44:15,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if they're using Internet Explorer, they really should switch, right?

637
00:44:16,219 --> 00:44:16,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Amen to that.

638
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:17,220
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

639
00:44:18,061 --> 00:44:18,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Where should the kids go?

640
00:44:20,632 --> 00:44:24,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight's website of the week is leettech.org.

641
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,557
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-3-3-7-T-E-C-H dot org.

642
00:44:28,378 --> 00:44:29,018
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the name.

643
00:44:29,038 --> 00:44:31,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Just the name alone really makes me giggle.

644
00:44:32,341 --> 00:44:44,350
[SPEAKER_05]: But basically, it's a tech site, but it's not like the tech sites that are about big, massive amounts of jargon.

645
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:48,713
[SPEAKER_05]: To go ahead and quote their About Us page, I'll just read a little bit of this.

646
00:44:49,488 --> 00:44:51,929
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a website for technology and you're currently surfing it.

647
00:44:51,949 --> 00:44:52,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

648
00:44:52,829 --> 00:44:59,091
[SPEAKER_05]: This site is very much different from the other technology sites for the very reason that we bring technology close to the end user.

649
00:44:59,411 --> 00:45:05,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Many an end user do not want to be bugged by big, high, and mighty terms and would like to understand how a certain technology works and so on and so forth.

650
00:45:06,234 --> 00:45:07,294
[SPEAKER_05]: But what we do is different.

651
00:45:07,354 --> 00:45:09,795
[SPEAKER_05]: We put technology in terms that people understand.

652
00:45:10,175 --> 00:45:17,318
[SPEAKER_05]: We put it into fun, casual manners so expect lots of weird examples and analogies involving toilet bowls and kitchen sinks.

653
00:45:17,458 --> 00:45:18,318
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where we're different.

654
00:45:18,818 --> 00:45:20,079
[SPEAKER_05]: We do not emphasize the news.

655
00:45:20,139 --> 00:45:21,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Websites like Splashdot do that.

656
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,981
[SPEAKER_05]: We do not emphasize on reviews.

657
00:45:23,342 --> 00:45:24,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Websites like Tom's Hardware does that.

658
00:45:25,303 --> 00:45:26,544
[SPEAKER_05]: We emphasize on knowledge.

659
00:45:26,804 --> 00:45:28,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Knowledge for the common end user.

660
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:32,008
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I thought that was pretty cool.

661
00:45:32,108 --> 00:45:33,169
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of want to check that out.

662
00:45:33,229 --> 00:45:34,870
[SPEAKER_08]: That's almost like my teaching style, too.

663
00:45:34,911 --> 00:45:38,413
[SPEAKER_08]: When I teach things, I make all these crazy analogies to real life scenarios.

664
00:45:38,433 --> 00:45:39,214
[SPEAKER_08]: This is my day job.

665
00:45:39,294 --> 00:45:41,836
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a teacher for a business, so kind of interesting.

666
00:45:42,265 --> 00:45:47,089
[SPEAKER_05]: What impresses me is that they have an explanation on what leet and noob are.

667
00:45:47,789 --> 00:45:54,695
[SPEAKER_05]: And to quote this, every article in the site will have a noob-o-meter, and it states how rudimentary the article is about.

668
00:45:54,775 --> 00:45:59,378
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, if the noob-o-meter is at an extreme noob end, then the articles are just perfect for beginners.

669
00:45:59,858 --> 00:46:04,002
[SPEAKER_05]: On the other hand, if the noob-o-meter is at extreme leet end, the article is for more leet users.

670
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:06,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Warning, extreme noobness ahead.

671
00:46:06,283 --> 00:46:06,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Warning, warning.

672
00:46:07,024 --> 00:46:08,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, because being a noob ain't fun.

673
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:09,866
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

674
00:46:10,106 --> 00:46:13,948
[SPEAKER_05]: This site instantly gets my uber kudos.

675
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Website of the week, LeakTech1337.

676
00:46:16,589 --> 00:46:17,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, DarkSakura.

677
00:46:19,171 --> 00:46:22,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go over to Loki, who has some news regarding piracy.

678
00:46:24,053 --> 00:46:25,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, of course.

679
00:46:27,635 --> 00:46:30,656
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, I don't know.

680
00:46:31,477 --> 00:46:38,100
[SPEAKER_09]: This whole thing with the 360 and the firmware for the DVD and stuff, just

681
00:46:39,734 --> 00:46:40,375
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

682
00:47:04,201 --> 00:47:17,949
[SPEAKER_09]: and basically spotted his software for sale legally at a market in Moscow and has basically gotten into a fight with him and now is going to take him to an actual boxing match.

683
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:26,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, so the developer is actually going to... This is like celebrity boxing on Fox, in a way, is kind of what it reminds me of.

684
00:47:28,114 --> 00:47:28,775
[SPEAKER_08]: In the main event...

685
00:47:30,205 --> 00:47:30,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Fight Night Round 4

686
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:55,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Out there, some of you have them in your very own PCs.

687
00:47:55,468 --> 00:47:59,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they announced this last week that they have a new design contract with Sony.

688
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:08,574
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to get more money than what they earned for creating the graphics processor for the upcoming PlayStation 3 video game console.

689
00:48:08,874 --> 00:48:10,755
[SPEAKER_08]: This deal is going to run through 2007.

690
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:14,477
[SPEAKER_08]: But the thing is that we don't really know what this chip is for.

691
00:48:14,957 --> 00:48:16,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Could it be possibly about the PSP2?

692
00:48:18,263 --> 00:48:18,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

693
00:48:19,103 --> 00:48:23,465
[SPEAKER_08]: They might be bragging about the deal, but they can't talk about the details just yet.

694
00:48:23,565 --> 00:48:25,165
[SPEAKER_08]: So it could be just about anything.

695
00:48:25,225 --> 00:48:30,207
[SPEAKER_08]: So NVIDIA has a deal with Sony to make something, but we don't know what.

696
00:48:30,967 --> 00:48:33,868
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would likely say it's the PSP 2.

697
00:48:36,928 --> 00:48:37,209
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

698
00:48:40,502 --> 00:48:41,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

699
00:49:05,379 --> 00:49:09,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Call Echo 123 first to test your connection to make sure it works.

700
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:13,621
[SPEAKER_08]: You can also pick up the regular telephone and call us, 916-226-9067.

701
00:49:14,942 --> 00:49:21,844
[SPEAKER_08]: But please keep in mind that that may be a toll call, so please have the phone line owner's permission before you call in.

702
00:49:23,144 --> 00:49:31,588
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, we're going to be moving the Skype line on a bit more permanent basis towards the end of the show in response to recent feedback that our Skype line sometimes gets a little too random.

703
00:49:31,888 --> 00:49:35,230
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we want this to be is more the end of the show kind of open forum.

704
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:39,712
[SPEAKER_08]: So for our callers to be able to discuss basically whatever is on their mind.

705
00:49:39,972 --> 00:49:44,234
[SPEAKER_08]: There will be a more topical version of interaction that we'll announce in a later week.

706
00:49:44,794 --> 00:49:45,334
[SPEAKER_08]: So here we go.

707
00:49:45,354 --> 00:49:47,215
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to go ahead and pick up the phone, take our first call.

708
00:49:47,535 --> 00:49:48,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

709
00:49:50,327 --> 00:49:51,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, this is Simmel.

710
00:49:51,833 --> 00:49:52,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Simmel.

711
00:49:52,495 --> 00:49:53,218
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind, buddy?

712
00:49:54,439 --> 00:49:58,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a quick call just about you actually badmouthing the UK.

713
00:49:59,861 --> 00:50:00,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Were we badmouthing?

714
00:50:00,501 --> 00:50:03,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait a minute, we're getting video of you here in the studio too.

715
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:04,343
[SPEAKER_08]: That is crazy.

716
00:50:04,703 --> 00:50:06,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at this, we can actually see this guy who's calling in right now.

717
00:50:06,763 --> 00:50:09,304
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never seen that happen on Skype before.

718
00:50:09,404 --> 00:50:09,944
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty cool.

719
00:50:10,045 --> 00:50:10,745
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of cool.

720
00:50:11,065 --> 00:50:11,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, right on.

721
00:50:11,725 --> 00:50:14,506
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking a bit tired because it's like half five now.

722
00:50:15,266 --> 00:50:17,247
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got to be like five or six over there.

723
00:50:17,327 --> 00:50:19,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, what did we do to bash on the UK?

724
00:50:19,188 --> 00:50:20,188
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry bud, what did we do?

725
00:50:20,248 --> 00:50:22,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Just about when Guitar Hero was...

726
00:50:25,013 --> 00:50:25,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Guitar Hero?

727
00:50:27,416 --> 00:50:30,119
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the video may be slowing our connection there a little bit.

728
00:50:30,479 --> 00:50:34,443
[SPEAKER_08]: You had a question there in response to Guitar Hero.

729
00:50:34,824 --> 00:50:36,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Were we bashing on it a little bit there, or what?

730
00:50:37,186 --> 00:50:42,132
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just the fact that, yeah, I'm just trying to get rid of it.

731
00:50:44,632 --> 00:50:45,453
[SPEAKER_08]: I gotta let that one go.

732
00:50:45,533 --> 00:50:53,576
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so sorry, Simul, but we just got really, really bad feedback there, and I think people's speakers exploded during that, so sorry about that.

733
00:50:53,796 --> 00:50:55,677
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys should not bash on the UK.

734
00:50:55,717 --> 00:50:56,457
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't!

735
00:50:56,477 --> 00:50:57,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Shame on you!

736
00:50:57,458 --> 00:50:58,018
[SPEAKER_05]: We weren't!

737
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:02,400
[SPEAKER_05]: I made a whole segment just to read UK news, thank you.

738
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:09,027
[SPEAKER_08]: It's probably my fault because I was saying that Guitar Heroes was a little bit... I'm a little sick of it here.

739
00:51:09,067 --> 00:51:12,871
[SPEAKER_08]: But I understand you guys are getting it for the first time over there in the UK.

740
00:51:13,271 --> 00:51:14,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, you should check this game out.

741
00:51:14,773 --> 00:51:18,537
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just that I am getting sick of hearing it in the US.

742
00:51:18,817 --> 00:51:20,359
[SPEAKER_08]: It's time for us to move on.

743
00:51:20,419 --> 00:51:20,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess what?

744
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:21,300
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

745
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:21,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Guitar Hero.

746
00:51:24,284 --> 00:51:25,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell Rob about your newest piece of crack.

747
00:51:50,012 --> 00:51:51,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yes, Advanced Crack.

748
00:51:51,713 --> 00:51:58,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I got Advanced Crack DS at, uh, it's, uh, Crack, basically, yes.

749
00:51:59,438 --> 00:52:00,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Advanced Crack DS?

750
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:01,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Advanced Crack?

751
00:52:01,399 --> 00:52:02,920
[SPEAKER_08]: No, is that Advanced Wars?

752
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:03,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

753
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:05,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, what is so cool about this game?

754
00:52:07,542 --> 00:52:09,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's fun as hell.

755
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:12,125
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess hell is fun, yeah.

756
00:52:12,925 --> 00:52:14,306
[SPEAKER_08]: And Crack is Advanced.

757
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:15,567
[SPEAKER_08]: And Crack is fun.

758
00:52:15,867 --> 00:52:16,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

759
00:52:16,187 --> 00:52:16,587
[SPEAKER_08]: For some.

760
00:52:16,868 --> 00:52:19,129
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not regular Crack, it's Advanced Crack.

761
00:52:19,588 --> 00:52:21,269
[SPEAKER_08]: What other DS games are you into, Roz?

762
00:52:22,769 --> 00:52:23,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Phoenix Wright.

763
00:52:23,629 --> 00:52:26,150
[SPEAKER_03]: You all know about my horrible Phoenix Wright addiction.

764
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:26,610
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

765
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:28,511
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember hearing about that a couple weeks ago on the show.

766
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:29,751
[SPEAKER_08]: How is Phoenix Wright going?

767
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:30,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you beat it yet?

768
00:52:31,532 --> 00:52:32,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Like four times.

769
00:52:32,612 --> 00:52:32,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Dang!

770
00:52:33,552 --> 00:52:34,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, very cool.

771
00:52:34,953 --> 00:52:37,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Weren't you the one that had to drive a long ways to get it?

772
00:52:38,074 --> 00:52:40,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like six hours or so.

773
00:52:40,314 --> 00:52:41,415
[SPEAKER_08]: That is hardcore.

774
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:44,976
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess you have to beat a game four times after that type of dedication.

775
00:52:46,336 --> 00:52:48,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other feedback to stories we've been talking about tonight, Roz?

776
00:52:50,209 --> 00:52:52,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, tonight, I came in late.

777
00:52:53,051 --> 00:52:57,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but, let's see here.

778
00:52:57,414 --> 00:53:01,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I was desperately trying to get my mic to work last week, uh, to talk about the, uh, whole girl gamers issue.

779
00:53:01,476 --> 00:53:01,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Speak up!

780
00:53:19,569 --> 00:53:29,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, well, obviously, uh, not being a dude kind of pisses me off how, you know, the negative stereotypes and stuff.

781
00:53:32,484 --> 00:53:35,528
[SPEAKER_03]: And, I don't know, I just don't know what everyone's collective deal is.

782
00:53:35,868 --> 00:53:40,053
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, it's always a big deal when people find out that I'm not a dude.

783
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:42,385
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to rehash the old conversation.

784
00:54:11,264 --> 00:54:11,905
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

785
00:54:34,506 --> 00:54:39,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, there's fat and ugly people that play games, and sure, there's beautiful people that play games, but you know what?

786
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:46,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are the two extremes, and this is what we call a bell curve, and most people are somewhere in between.

787
00:54:46,396 --> 00:54:48,718
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, most of us are just, we're average looking.

788
00:54:49,538 --> 00:54:50,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, pretty much.

789
00:54:50,699 --> 00:54:55,663
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think that SSJ100, Matt actually just said it kind of best in the chat room.

790
00:54:56,284 --> 00:54:58,946
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, most people are like, oh my god, you're a girl, ASL picks please.

791
00:55:00,323 --> 00:55:06,226
[SPEAKER_05]: I get that crap on, not on the current Ragnarok that I'm playing on because people are like, oh, you're cool, you're not a bot.

792
00:55:07,087 --> 00:55:08,848
[SPEAKER_05]: But on IRO, I got it all the time.

793
00:55:09,628 --> 00:55:09,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

794
00:55:10,629 --> 00:55:16,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I moderate at a role-playing forum and all of my characters are male, pretty much.

795
00:55:17,873 --> 00:55:22,175
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when people find out that I'm not a guy, it tends to freak them out.

796
00:55:22,275 --> 00:55:27,718
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I get all these people pouring in on Messenger trying to hit on me.

797
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:30,260
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's invisible all the time.

798
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:34,061
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't you get people that assume you must be a lesbian because you play a male character?

799
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:35,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I've heard girls tell me that.

800
00:55:35,442 --> 00:55:35,982
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard that.

801
00:55:36,402 --> 00:55:37,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's so stupid.

802
00:55:38,143 --> 00:55:38,603
[SPEAKER_08]: So stupid.

803
00:55:38,643 --> 00:55:42,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Then again, how many female characters online are really, you know, boys?

804
00:55:43,144 --> 00:55:43,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

805
00:55:43,765 --> 00:55:51,668
[SPEAKER_08]: And we just had the emails from the guys that play the girl characters because they are good characters in the games.

806
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:54,068
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nothing to do with... It's so silly.

807
00:55:54,569 --> 00:55:55,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is.

808
00:55:56,082 --> 00:55:57,642
[SPEAKER_08]: People need to put stereotypes aside.

809
00:55:57,742 --> 00:55:58,623
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what they need to do.

810
00:55:59,043 --> 00:56:00,703
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Roz, thank you so much for your call.

811
00:56:00,743 --> 00:56:01,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Appreciate it.

812
00:56:02,043 --> 00:56:02,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

813
00:56:02,483 --> 00:56:03,204
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, have a good one.

814
00:56:04,204 --> 00:56:04,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

815
00:56:04,484 --> 00:56:04,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye-bye.

816
00:56:04,704 --> 00:56:07,605
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we're going to go ahead and go to another call here.

817
00:56:07,685 --> 00:56:09,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to this one.

818
00:56:09,625 --> 00:56:10,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

819
00:56:12,105 --> 00:56:12,946
[SPEAKER_06]: I have sweaty balls.

820
00:56:13,506 --> 00:56:14,986
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, my friend.

821
00:56:15,446 --> 00:56:16,106
[SPEAKER_08]: That's nice.

822
00:56:16,967 --> 00:56:20,147
[SPEAKER_08]: What, you've been playing DDR naked again, or what's the deal?

823
00:56:20,427 --> 00:56:21,347
[SPEAKER_08]: My nipples are hard.

824
00:56:21,688 --> 00:56:22,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up.

825
00:56:25,138 --> 00:56:26,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's our mature rating for the night!

826
00:56:55,066 --> 00:56:55,987
[SPEAKER_08]: I overrated Guitar Hero?

827
00:56:57,589 --> 00:57:01,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, everybody does, but, yeah.

828
00:57:01,792 --> 00:57:05,196
[SPEAKER_05]: How can one overrate one's own personal opinion of the game?

829
00:57:06,257 --> 00:57:09,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it doesn't match up with my personal opinion, and my personal opinion is God.

830
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,762
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna hit you with a trap in a second.

831
00:57:12,583 --> 00:57:14,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so what, you don't like Guitar Hero?

832
00:57:15,686 --> 00:57:17,207
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I like it, it's just overrated.

833
00:57:17,827 --> 00:57:18,928
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

834
00:57:37,942 --> 00:57:40,445
[SPEAKER_08]: is not a hugely original concept.

835
00:57:40,605 --> 00:57:44,249
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a fusion of two existing concepts in my mind.

836
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:45,951
[SPEAKER_08]: And that doesn't make it a bad game.

837
00:57:46,132 --> 00:57:47,213
[SPEAKER_08]: I love Guitar Hero.

838
00:57:47,253 --> 00:57:47,793
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a great game.

839
00:57:48,114 --> 00:57:50,316
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm a little, you know, I'm kind of over it now.

840
00:57:50,537 --> 00:57:51,177
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

841
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:54,141
[SPEAKER_08]: It's time for me to move on to another music game for now.

842
00:57:54,461 --> 00:57:58,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think the reason they got like so high scores though is because they got all that

843
00:57:59,765 --> 00:58:25,736
[SPEAKER_08]: I totally agree and I think Konami made some mistakes in not having more faith in the US audience and spending the money on some higher licenses when they came out here and I take my hats off to Red Octane for recognizing that and Harmonix as well we give Konami a lot of love on this show but we have to give them tough love too when the time is appropriate so

844
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody deserves tough love, I guess.

845
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:28,641
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

846
00:58:28,821 --> 00:58:30,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, anything else on your mind, Xander?

847
00:58:32,782 --> 00:58:34,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, on the girl gamer thingy.

848
00:58:34,942 --> 00:58:35,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

849
00:58:35,782 --> 00:58:41,184
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to say, I'm upset as a male asexual that I don't get bashed.

850
00:58:42,184 --> 00:58:42,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

851
00:58:42,804 --> 00:58:46,145
[SPEAKER_06]: The gays get bashed, the girls get bashed and crap.

852
00:58:46,565 --> 00:58:47,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't I get bashed?

853
00:58:47,725 --> 00:58:48,345
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not fair.

854
00:58:48,485 --> 00:58:50,446
[SPEAKER_10]: We do secretly bash you.

855
00:58:50,486 --> 00:58:52,687
[SPEAKER_05]: I bash you every night in the chat room.

856
00:58:53,087 --> 00:58:54,507
[SPEAKER_08]: They're all talking about you behind your back.

857
00:58:55,037 --> 00:58:55,537
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, okay.

858
00:58:55,838 --> 00:58:59,541
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, define this for me again, because this is a term that a lot of our podcast listeners are probably going, huh?

859
00:58:59,981 --> 00:59:02,523
[SPEAKER_08]: You define yourself as asexual, which means... Yes.

860
00:59:03,865 --> 00:59:05,686
[SPEAKER_06]: It means I'm an amoeba.

861
00:59:06,707 --> 00:59:07,488
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you a eunuch?

862
00:59:08,509 --> 00:59:12,772
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it means that he doesn't think about sex, period.

863
00:59:12,852 --> 00:59:17,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, because if you're a eunuch, I was just going to say, you wouldn't have balls.

864
00:59:17,356 --> 00:59:18,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, just shush.

865
00:59:18,677 --> 00:59:19,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Just quiet over there.

866
00:59:19,898 --> 00:59:20,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, extrovert?

867
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:21,220
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

868
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:27,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so, well, do you ever get asked in games, like ASL and all this?

869
00:59:27,432 --> 00:59:30,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you ever have people try to cyber flirt with you or whatever?

870
00:59:30,753 --> 00:59:32,013
[SPEAKER_06]: In that sense, Coke Music.

871
00:59:32,614 --> 00:59:33,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Coke Music?

872
00:59:33,394 --> 00:59:34,534
[SPEAKER_08]: What happened in Coke Music?

873
00:59:36,115 --> 00:59:37,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I realized it sucked.

874
00:59:39,416 --> 00:59:39,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

875
00:59:39,616 --> 00:59:40,036
[SPEAKER_08]: What happened?

876
00:59:40,056 --> 00:59:41,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Were people hitting on you there?

877
00:59:42,097 --> 00:59:43,057
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it just sucks.

878
00:59:43,157 --> 00:59:43,937
[SPEAKER_06]: It always sucked.

879
00:59:43,977 --> 00:59:44,878
[SPEAKER_08]: I just grew up a little.

880
00:59:45,238 --> 00:59:45,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, okay.

881
00:59:46,718 --> 00:59:51,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well, can anybody think of a good insult for the asexual gamer?

882
00:59:51,816 --> 00:59:52,797
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I already did.

883
00:59:53,818 --> 00:59:55,079
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a nookiless freak.

884
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:57,700
[SPEAKER_08]: How's that?

885
00:59:57,740 --> 00:59:58,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that count?

886
00:59:58,321 --> 01:00:00,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that make you feel better to be bashed there, Xander, a little bit?

887
01:00:01,603 --> 01:00:02,004
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess.

888
01:00:02,204 --> 01:00:03,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well, we appreciate your call.

889
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:06,567
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't bash on anybody.

890
01:00:06,827 --> 01:00:10,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a good night and have fun not getting late, okay?

891
01:00:11,050 --> 01:00:11,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

892
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:11,811
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, later.

893
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:13,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to one more call.

894
01:00:15,342 --> 01:00:16,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we better set aside 10 minutes.

895
01:00:16,923 --> 01:00:17,763
[SPEAKER_08]: Zaku's on the line.

896
01:00:17,843 --> 01:00:18,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Zaku, what's on your mind?

897
01:00:18,963 --> 01:00:19,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

898
01:00:20,084 --> 01:00:29,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember that link I sent you last week about how MTV interviewed this DDR player from around my area?

899
01:00:29,187 --> 01:00:33,929
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to know whether or not you got a chance to even look at it.

900
01:00:34,789 --> 01:00:35,749
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to be honest, I didn't.

901
01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:37,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

902
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:39,971
[SPEAKER_08]: Send me the link and post it in chat.

903
01:00:41,051 --> 01:00:41,371
[SPEAKER_01]: I will.

904
01:00:41,391 --> 01:00:43,492
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll post it again, but honestly, you know...

905
01:00:44,275 --> 01:00:50,256
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take a look at it, you know, and personally I think, you know, MTV did a good job in doing it.

906
01:00:50,316 --> 01:01:00,599
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say they did the best, but it's not like, you know, they didn't do a lame-ass attempt in trying to, you know, trying to feed on the stereotype of DDR being a healthy thing.

907
01:01:01,579 --> 01:01:03,119
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, set this up for me a little bit, Zaku.

908
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:03,879
[SPEAKER_08]: What is in this clip?

909
01:01:03,939 --> 01:01:05,820
[SPEAKER_08]: If I watch this clip, what am I going to get?

910
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:11,301
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see, you know, a DDR player by the name of Anthony, also known as Sketch.

911
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:16,602
[SPEAKER_01]: He's one of the best DDR players in the city and he was interviewed by MTV for Overdrive.

912
01:01:16,682 --> 01:01:19,643
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, you're going to see a lot of the perspective of the hardcore DDR player.

913
01:01:19,663 --> 01:01:22,464
[SPEAKER_01]: The one who basically goes after scores and just goes after perfecting...

914
01:01:37,233 --> 01:01:37,873
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

915
01:01:58,055 --> 01:02:00,057
[SPEAKER_10]: I say get the British guy back on the line.

916
01:02:00,177 --> 01:02:01,138
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, he didn't call back.

917
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:02,819
[SPEAKER_08]: You didn't give him enough time.

918
01:02:03,099 --> 01:02:04,360
[SPEAKER_10]: His thing blew up on me.

919
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:07,963
[SPEAKER_10]: But British people, their voices are cool.

920
01:02:08,003 --> 01:02:09,044
[SPEAKER_10]: We need more coolness.

921
01:02:10,005 --> 01:02:12,547
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got to go ahead and close the Skype line for now.

922
01:02:12,887 --> 01:02:15,950
[SPEAKER_08]: If he calls in next week, we'll definitely get him again.

923
01:02:15,990 --> 01:02:17,511
[SPEAKER_08]: And he can yell at me more over Guitar Girl.

924
01:02:17,531 --> 01:02:20,974
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's cool that he stays up until 5, 6 in the morning listening to us.

925
01:02:21,014 --> 01:02:22,195
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, that's dedication.

926
01:02:22,295 --> 01:02:29,057
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know that over on All Games where they syndicate us, they play us at like different times of the day on Tuesday and Wednesday.

927
01:02:29,417 --> 01:02:33,119
[SPEAKER_08]: So like, no, I think on Tuesday we're played like in the morning.

928
01:02:33,479 --> 01:02:34,679
[SPEAKER_08]: So that might be a different time.

929
01:02:34,839 --> 01:02:40,561
[SPEAKER_08]: So those that want the live experience to kind of listen to this as it goes on can listen at those times too.

930
01:02:40,621 --> 01:02:42,422
[SPEAKER_08]: And that can help adjust for time zones.

931
01:02:42,582 --> 01:02:43,602
[SPEAKER_08]: So something to think about.

932
01:02:45,263 --> 01:02:45,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

933
01:02:46,423 --> 01:02:46,683
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

934
01:02:47,446 --> 01:02:47,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Beat Takashi!

935
01:02:47,987 --> 01:02:48,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Beat Takashi!

936
01:03:15,049 --> 01:03:16,010
[SPEAKER_09]: TAKASHI'S CHALLENGE

937
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:47,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Takashi's Challenge puts the players through hell, like forcing the player to sing karaoke continuously, stare at a blank monitor, pilot a plane that can't go up, and then hit the final boss 20,000 times.

938
01:03:47,998 --> 01:03:51,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Was this a for-real video game that was released, or is this some weirdo?

939
01:03:51,239 --> 01:03:53,600
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, Taito released it back in 1986.

940
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:53,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

941
01:03:54,041 --> 01:03:58,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Dot, dot, dot.

942
01:03:58,843 --> 01:04:01,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Taito is the same cracked-out company that gave us...

943
01:04:03,485 --> 01:04:04,325
[SPEAKER_05]: and Bubble Bobble.

944
01:04:26,573 --> 01:04:27,614
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what's up, liar?

945
01:04:27,754 --> 01:04:28,694
[SPEAKER_09]: It got pushed back.

946
01:04:29,455 --> 01:04:30,555
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, liar of the week.

947
01:04:30,815 --> 01:04:32,536
[SPEAKER_09]: No, EA's the liar of the week.

948
01:04:32,556 --> 01:04:33,477
[SPEAKER_09]: EA's pushed it back.

949
01:04:33,537 --> 01:04:35,658
[SPEAKER_09]: It's supposed to come out on the 28th.

950
01:04:37,299 --> 01:04:38,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Or 29th, I'm sorry.

951
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:40,841
[SPEAKER_09]: Between the 28th and 29th, they say.

952
01:04:42,321 --> 01:04:43,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometime Tuesday and Wednesday.

953
01:04:44,342 --> 01:04:47,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe about 8 o'clock Tuesday night is in between there.

954
01:04:47,584 --> 01:04:53,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, listen, you got Burnout and freaking Blazing Angels, so play those while you're waiting.

955
01:04:53,347 --> 01:04:53,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, sir.

956
01:04:56,485 --> 01:04:57,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I have something.

957
01:04:57,866 --> 01:04:58,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

958
01:04:58,667 --> 01:05:00,568
[SPEAKER_05]: This is from Old Grandma Hardcore.

959
01:05:01,549 --> 01:05:03,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yes, her, the granny gamer.

960
01:05:03,851 --> 01:05:04,512
[SPEAKER_05]: The granny gamer.

961
01:05:04,532 --> 01:05:04,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Love her.

962
01:05:05,773 --> 01:05:20,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, there is a chronicle out on YouTube now, and the link is up at oldgrannyhardcore.blogspot.com, about how she has laid down some massive, massive ownage at brain training.

963
01:05:21,986 --> 01:05:22,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Right on.

964
01:05:22,747 --> 01:05:23,607
[SPEAKER_05]: And apparently...

965
01:05:27,404 --> 01:05:31,045
[SPEAKER_05]: There was actually a few of the other people who were playing who actually said that drinking helped their scores improve.

966
01:05:32,005 --> 01:05:39,107
[SPEAKER_05]: But Granny had finished her game while the little girl was still going past the time limit.

967
01:05:39,787 --> 01:05:40,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

968
01:05:40,587 --> 01:05:42,448
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, and there's a movie file up here.

969
01:05:42,488 --> 01:05:43,748
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to share that with our chat room.

970
01:05:44,088 --> 01:05:52,611
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you go to oghc.blogspot.com, the link is up there for the week of March 20th.

971
01:05:53,391 --> 01:05:53,771
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.

972
01:05:54,775 --> 01:05:58,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I got one last story for you guys here tonight.

973
01:05:59,159 --> 01:06:06,406
[SPEAKER_08]: And it has to do with, I'm sure, a TV show that our folks that listen to us live don't watch because it's on the same time as our program.

974
01:06:06,906 --> 01:06:08,508
[SPEAKER_08]: But it does have to do with gaming, believe it or not.

975
01:06:09,148 --> 01:06:20,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Walt Disney's Buena Vista Games said this week that it is going to be releasing a PC video game based on the television show Desperate Housewives this fall.

976
01:06:20,138 --> 01:06:20,439
[SPEAKER_08]: What?! !

977
01:06:21,259 --> 01:06:22,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Desperate Housewives

978
01:06:50,854 --> 01:07:05,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's your chance Something tells me those guys that emailed us saying they like to play as the girls Something tells me they'll take a pass on this one Call it a hunch Loki, don't you watch Desperate Housewives?

979
01:07:05,509 --> 01:07:06,831
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I don't Oh, I thought you did

980
01:07:07,156 --> 01:07:09,318
[SPEAKER_09]: No, Nelly watches Desperate Housewives.

981
01:07:10,639 --> 01:07:12,921
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not watch Desperate Housewives.

982
01:07:13,722 --> 01:07:18,927
[SPEAKER_09]: I may have been forced to watch the first season of Desperate Housewives, but that's where it stops.

983
01:07:19,187 --> 01:07:19,747
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't.

984
01:07:20,008 --> 01:07:24,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Our show's on at the same time here on the West Coast, so we can't watch it, even if we wanted to, which I don't.

985
01:07:24,932 --> 01:07:25,653
You can watch it.

986
01:07:26,814 --> 01:07:27,354
[SPEAKER_08]: You can watch it.

987
01:07:27,374 --> 01:07:28,175
[SPEAKER_08]: We have not TiVo.

988
01:07:29,696 --> 01:07:30,097
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

989
01:07:30,337 --> 01:07:31,578
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't feel like taking the effort.

990
01:07:32,399 --> 01:07:33,640
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just how it stands.

991
01:07:33,902 --> 01:07:35,783
[SPEAKER_09]: The only way I'd play this game is if I can kill them.

992
01:07:38,965 --> 01:07:42,086
[SPEAKER_08]: And by kill them, I mean brutally kill them.

993
01:07:42,486 --> 01:07:45,268
[SPEAKER_08]: 23rd Magus says no hot coffee equals instaloos.

994
01:07:45,648 --> 01:07:47,649
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe we need to have hot coffee in this.

995
01:07:47,829 --> 01:07:52,511
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, those of you guys out there that have always wanted to... What's her name?

996
01:07:53,452 --> 01:07:56,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Gabriela... What the hell's her name?

997
01:07:56,373 --> 01:07:57,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Gabriela Carteris?

998
01:07:57,254 --> 01:07:57,834
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no.

999
01:07:57,914 --> 01:07:58,754
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the chick in 90210.

1000
01:07:58,875 --> 01:07:59,155
[SPEAKER_08]: I know!

1001
01:07:59,195 --> 01:07:59,775
[SPEAKER_08]: Same show.

1002
01:08:04,369 --> 01:08:06,290
[SPEAKER_08]: What the hell's... Oh, Eva Longoria.

1003
01:08:06,891 --> 01:08:07,871
[SPEAKER_08]: She plays somebody, I think.

1004
01:08:08,672 --> 01:08:09,992
[SPEAKER_08]: She plays Gabrielle on the show.

1005
01:08:10,032 --> 01:08:10,833
[SPEAKER_08]: How the hell do I know that?

1006
01:08:10,873 --> 01:08:11,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, Eva Longoria.

1007
01:08:12,954 --> 01:08:13,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?

1008
01:08:13,134 --> 01:08:14,595
[SPEAKER_08]: She's the hot one on the show.

1009
01:08:14,755 --> 01:08:17,317
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I'm sure a lot of guys want to, you know... I guess.

1010
01:08:17,637 --> 01:08:18,177
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1011
01:08:19,038 --> 01:08:19,338
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

1012
01:08:19,378 --> 01:08:19,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Forget it.

1013
01:08:20,218 --> 01:08:21,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's just end the show.

1014
01:08:21,879 --> 01:08:22,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's quit while we're ahead.

1015
01:08:23,921 --> 01:08:26,142
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.

1016
01:08:26,202 --> 01:08:27,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, your final thought.

1017
01:08:27,383 --> 01:08:32,566
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is I just read another story that's yet pointing to Nintendo doing VR.

1018
01:08:32,826 --> 01:08:32,986
[SPEAKER_09]: But,

1019
01:08:34,843 --> 01:08:35,943
[SPEAKER_09]: This is rumor stories.

1020
01:08:36,003 --> 01:08:37,104
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate rumor stories.

1021
01:08:37,484 --> 01:08:38,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Six weeks, Loki.

1022
01:08:38,784 --> 01:08:39,264
[SPEAKER_09]: You can wait.

1023
01:08:39,765 --> 01:08:40,485
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I can't.

1024
01:08:40,785 --> 01:08:41,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Ekstafer, your final thought.

1025
01:08:44,426 --> 01:08:48,667
[SPEAKER_10]: To all the girl-babe gamers out there, preach on, brothers.

1026
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:49,367
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, sistas.

1027
01:08:51,508 --> 01:08:53,108
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

1028
01:08:53,748 --> 01:08:59,830
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to pass on the reject false icons this week in order to describe a beverage called the Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster.

1029
01:09:00,710 --> 01:09:02,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Those of us who read Hitchhiker's Guide know what this is.

1030
01:09:03,655 --> 01:09:10,017
[SPEAKER_05]: It says the effect of a pan-galactic gargle blaster is like having your brain smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped around a large gold brick.

1031
01:09:11,497 --> 01:09:12,617
[SPEAKER_05]: I need one of those right now.

1032
01:09:14,298 --> 01:09:21,660
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought would be I really suck at Geometry Wars and I'm never going to get better and that makes me a sad gamer.

1033
01:09:22,833 --> 01:09:26,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you guys so much for tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio.

1037
01:09:35,617 --> 01:09:48,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Spread the word because, you know, there's hundreds of different gaming podcasts out there and while, you know, some of them are independent and certainly we support them too, you know, there's a lot of corporate ones too that get a lot of marketing muscle that we don't have.

1038
01:09:48,248 --> 01:09:51,030
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have to rely on word of mouth to get our name out there.
