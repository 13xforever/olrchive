61977	66100	They're actually going to have performing at the show this Guitar Hero Band.
66781	72306	And what they've done is they've actually gotten heroes of guitar playing to perform at this band, like
72566	73966	I don't want to read the entire list here.
73986	75387	You guys can go to allgames.com to check it out.
75427	75867	But get this.
76267	79288	Lyle Workman, who's like a guitar player for Sting and Beck.
79668	84069	And they have Daryl Anders, who's the bassist for Tower of Power and Bonnie Hayes.
84849	89870	They also have Marcus Henderson, who's the guitar player for Drist and En Vogue.
90130	94972	And they just have like all these standout stars there that are going to be performing in this band.
94992	95832	So that should be kind of fun.
96212	96752	So check that out.
96772	100513	They're going to be airing that live over on All Games, our buddies over there.
101454	104056	All right, so let's get into some news.
104496	108499	Last segment we talked about Katamari Damacy ending, sad.
108820	112563	We also talked about some big lies going around in the industry right now.
112803	113803	Big stinky ones.
113944	117426	And now we're going to talk about some big acquisitions and things of that nature.
117506	118107	Loki, what's up?
118547	121929	Yes, tis the season to buy a company smaller than yours.
123050	124611	Starting off here with THQ.
124691	126552	They're acquiring Vigil Games.
127853	137579	For those probably not very familiar with Vigil Games, they created both Marvel's Uncanny X-Men and Battle Chasers series.
138760	139200	And so...
141018	157892	It's part of the studio system strategy, which is designed to foster a singular vision and unique culture at each of our studios, according to Jack Sorensen, the executive vice president of the worldwide studios at THQ.
158432	165858	And it's basically to inject more of that creativity into their games, I guess, where it may be lacking.
168382	169403	Yeah, you know what?
169503	173167	Actually, now that I think of it, THQ did create... I want to see the outfit.
173187	174808	I don't know, that game was pretty fun.
175489	186619	Anyways, speaking of bigger fish in the pond, Sony, they've signed a deal with PlayLogic for future first-party games, and that should be pretty interesting.
187240	193125	Now, unfortunately, they haven't said what the game was, but it is slated to come out on PSP PlayStation 2...
194352	194412	E.A.
194432	196133	is purchasing Battlefield developer Digital Illusion CE
211775	212776	Battlefield 2 Demo March 24 Xbox Live
227970	232113	The demo is actually going to have up to 24 players being able to play online.
232433	240259	So this is kind of cool that a lot of the Xbox Live demos lately have been, you know, these big multiplayer things like the outfit and all that stuff.
240319	247164	So even though they're not my type of games, like I really tried, you guys, I tried to play Battlefield 2 because everybody was just raving about it, but it's just...
247424	249045	It's just not my type of game.
249945	251425	Maybe I'll check it out on Xbox Live.
251445	252446	Hell, if it's free, why not?
252466	253006	I'll check it out.
253046	257287	But I'm going to suck, and I'm going to be a detriment to any team I'm on.
257808	258708	But check that out.
259068	261029	It's coming out for the Xbox 360 in April.
263269	264750	April 11th or 12th
280074	282017	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
297856	313168	and I haven't watched MTV in forever so I didn't even know they were making music videos in high def but I guess that makes sense just real quick the Xbox Live top 10 games of the week 10 needs first speed most wanted 9 the outfit demo 8 Battlefield 2 which is amazing because how is that
313488	314009	Already there.
314389	316531	Is it the old one?
316571	317712	I'm thinking the old one on Xbox.
318433	318993	That's what it is.
319393	322076	Okay, and then seven, Project Gotham Racing 3.
322676	323497	Six, Dead or Alive 4.
324678	325779	Five, Perfect Dark Zero.
325859	327361	Four, EA Sports Fight Night Round 3.
327821	328702	Three, Call of Duty 2.
329362	330283	Two, Ghost Recon 3.
330563	332165	And number one is still Halo 2.
333646	336629	Should we start a betting pool on when Halo 2 will actually be dethroned?
337284	338124	Halo 3, Gears of War
364485	365585	I think the 24th was the day.
365605	366366	You got 10 days.
367206	369127	10 days, Capcom, Xbox.
369747	370727	Get that stuff out there.
370827	371408	I want to play it.
372668	375169	All right, I want my achievement points for beating the game with Chun-Li 100%.
375349	379411	Well, I heard that the reason why it wasn't out yet is because they're having trouble with lag.
379951	380831	Lots of lag.
381812	382992	Or that horrible lag.
383172	389515	Fine, if they have to spend extra time to make it work good, then that's fine, because we don't want them releasing it and just patching it later to make up for it.
389575	392356	That's fine, but a status check would be nice.
392936	393276	Nice.
394369	398111	Alright, moving on to another completely different topic.
398171	403032	DarkSakura, we were talking about Silent Hill a little bit in Part A, but this is not about the movie, necessarily.
403473	404033	Kind of, sort of.
404753	414437	There's actually a talk from 1UP stating that there's going to be a Silent Hill remake on the PS2.
416758	421760	Konami's been all happy over the talk about the movie, so there's a
422526	431950	A rumor that they are going to re-release the first game though with Harry Mason's wife, who is the heroine of the movie.
433772	435353	So it does have to do with the movie after all.
435413	437075	Yeah, it's sort of a tie-in.
437175	442839	I think that that's a good idea, but, you know, they'd have to make some changes.
443160	445301	It'd have to be an alternate universe sort of thing.
445662	445942	Yeah.
446402	450806	Wouldn't that have to kind of come out, like, very soon, if they wanted it to promote the movie?
450906	452627	Or maybe they're going to wait for the DVD release?
452647	453488	I don't know.
453548	457671	Wait for the DVD release, because you want to see how well the movie does first before you go and make a game about it.
457791	459353	Wouldn't that be a great combo pack, though?
459613	460554	DVD and game?
460934	461134	No.
461795	462115	Why not?
462891	463631	I think they've tried it.
463651	464291	Sony does that?
464351	465471	Oh, no, I'm thinking of the PSP.
465512	467532	Yeah, Sony did do that once.
467612	468652	They did, oh, what was it?
468752	471313	Stealth in the Wipeout Stealth, which, whoo!
471713	472753	No, that didn't sell very well.
472973	473873	My bad, sorry.
474533	475393	By the way, stealth sucked.
476453	477534	I'll take your word for it.
477934	480514	Is this something you'd probably check out, Jamie, being a fan of Silent Hill?
480534	480954	Oh, of course.
481074	481834	Yeah, I think I would, too.
482715	483235	Absolutely.
483435	488356	Even though remakes can be a little ass sometimes, I mean, sometimes they're really good, and I think back to, of course, Mario Bros.
488416	490036	All-Stars and the greatest remakes they ever did.
490316	490496	Hello?
491653	492013	Viva Piñata
516943	518504	Hooray Pinatas!
518724	525907	It's a game which is going to have a cartoon based on it about a living island of pinatas.
526787	529128	And what, may you ask, pinatas do?
529669	539413	Well, they have to fix this garden that has kind of gone awry and you have to lure your fellow pinatas to your garden.
540996	543998	So that's what that second to last VG Cats was about.
544138	544919	I didn't get it.
546640	547701	It just all came together.
547801	548801	It just dawned on me.
548901	549722	Oh my god, it was so much fun.
549742	550242	So what is this?
550563	552284	Xbox's response to Animal Crossing, right?
552984	553845	Is the easy way to put it?
554966	555086	It's...
556090	560013	They're trying to make a Pokemon, and goddammit, they're going to be damned if it'll happen.
560033	562255	Because aren't they supposed to do like a TV show in all night?
562555	563376	Oh, yeah.
563436	563856	Oh, boy.
564476	565277	A TV show.
565297	567118	About pinatas.
567198	572923	If I come into a town of Eva Pinata and start regulating with a baseball bat, will I get lots of candy?
573383	573563	No.
573663	575745	This is the only way I would want this game to come out.
576005	582474	If you could play a little kid who fucking goes around with a giant stick and beats the shit out of these stupid animals and steals their candy.
582815	584036	That is the game I want.
584477	586540	God damn it, Grand Theft Pinata.
586981	592689	I have to ask, why all this hate for Viva Pinata before you've even... Have you seen the website?
593357	595518	Seriously, have you seen the website?
595538	597439	I saw screenshots, I have not seen the website.
597459	598180	Have you seen the website?
598200	599201	No, I have not seen the website.
599221	599981	I've seen screenshots of the game.
600001	603363	The website is like some Shrek wannabe crap.
603443	604744	These characters come out.
605124	606845	They even, they're like, what the hell?
606905	608586	A game based on piñatas?
608686	611928	I mean, it's seriously, I don't know.
612008	613529	It sounds like it could be innovative.
613868	623652	with the way they're doing Xbox Live where you can communicate with other players and send your pinatas to their stuff to kind of make it like Animal Crossing type of thing.
624953	626813	But really, it looks stupid.
627454	628794	It looks stupid.
630455	632416	We have chatters that disagree.
632436	634797	Xander C in our chatroom says, Viva Pinata looks awesome.
634937	635417	Seriously.
638078	639859	Is it just because maybe this isn't your kind of thing?
640279	640479	No.
640799	642620	It was Penny Arcade, not VGCats, by the way.
643060	643140	Oh.
643629	644429	Pinyarkade.
644730	645830	Their comic was hilarious.
645890	648871	But no, seriously, I have seen the website.
649292	655174	I watched the little flash video that they have where they're doing screen tests of this Viva Pinata thing.
655594	658396	It looks like it's a bad Pixar movie gone awry.
660410	660750	I don't know.
660870	661651	It could be cool.
661831	663491	They could come out of nowhere and make it cool.
663612	664272	But you know what?
664392	667313	I think this is just going to be another failed attempt like Cameo.
667553	670055	Because Cameo, to be honest, wasn't that great of a game.
670435	671555	It was supposed to be a Zelda killer.
671575	673056	It wasn't quite a Zelda killer.
673116	673956	No, it's not a Zelda killer.
674056	675017	It's an okay game.
675437	680019	It's pretty much, if you're an adventure gamer person, it's pretty much your only choice right now.
680059	680720	And it's okay.
681140	683801	It just feels like it could have been done on the regular Xbox.
683841	685442	It feels like there's really...
686355	690981	Fable was almost just the same type of thing in many ways.
691001	693504	Props are rare for at least trying something different.
694545	698710	The only problem is I don't like the idea of how they're putting out this cartoon thing to go with it.
698990	702053	Because all they're trying to do is like, well kids like cartoons.
702594	704496	Cartoons sold Pokemon.
704576	705778	Let's... I mean...
707088	707388	I don't know.
707468	707829	You know what?
708349	718900	I applaud them for doing something different besides the usual Xbox fare, which turns a lot of people off to the system, which is sports, shooters, and all those types of games.
718980	723044	We need some more variety in the Xbox lineup, so I'm happy they're trying.
723505	726307	Rare needs to just put out another goddamn Killer Instincts game.
728510	729110	Can they, though?
729170	729851	I don't think they can.
730506	732848	Well, fine, make something else that's similar.
733449	736612	Just make another fighting game or something, or put out something really good.
738133	739354	Seriously, go to the website.
739374	742797	If you think I'm lying about how crappy this game is, go to the website.
742817	744459	Which most of our chatroom does disagree with me.
744479	750384	Okay, and go to the website, watch the video, and tell me if you're not pissed off at this game after you watch the video.
750844	751185	Seriously.
751525	756349	I want a piñata game like a first-person shooter, so you go around and shoot the piñatas, and then you have to go cut the candy.
756369	756890	And you get candy.
757748	761429	DarkSakura, you ready to inject some rage into this episode of Orange Launch Radio?
761449	762749	Shut up and play the music!
762769	763309	Alright. ...
789008	793572	My FU of the week goes towards education.
794733	809305	Because I've been having to deal with, I dropped a class, and then I have a, she's such a smart lady, a great teacher, but she tells us there's this assignment due and the assignment's not on the assignment page, it's just for each chapter, so what do we do?
810074	821282	You know, it just bugs me that there's this expectation that we don't have lives outside of class, that we are given just buttloads of homework to do, and some of us work full-time, so what's up with that?
822263	826266	And that's, it's not a very big FU, but that's what's been on my mind.
827047	827347	Alright.
828287	829048	Loki, your FU.
831130	832771	My FU is the bad drivers.
832791	833331	Okay, get this.
833832	838495	I was driving down the freeway today, going to go check out Tux's for the wedding.
839158	842580	and I see some dumbass pulling off to the side of the road.
842841	847384	He's like, because he missed his intersection or turn or whatever off the freeway.
848244	852167	The friggin' idiot starts backing up on the freeway.
852727	853408	Backing up.
853568	855329	Flipped the goddamn thing in the reverse.
855709	856290	Who was driving?
856310	858171	Oh, goddamn woman in a fucking SUV.
858631	859532	Bad.
860552	861413	Bad people.
863094	863815	Was she on her phone?
864781	872210	Oh, she probably was, but I didn't bother to look because there was a giant trail of smoke from her skidding into the goddamn side of the road there.
873351	876415	Stupid people out there, and I see it daily.
878257	878918	Curses.
880440	882683	My FU would go to Weekends.
883576	886318	Or should I say actually the work week, because weekends aren't long enough.
886378	893462	I really feel like I haven't done, I mean, don't get me wrong, I've actually done a lot, a lot of stuff this weekend, but not enough.
893522	902728	I kind of wish there was more time in the weekend, because I really have had no time to just kind of lie on the couch and go, I'm just relaxing today.
903549	908452	So F you to our society only allowing us two days on the weekend.
908472	909072	I think that's crap.
910236	913137	I think we should work for two days in a week and get a five-day weekend.
913157	913638	That would rock.
915519	916259	Of course, I'm just lazy.
917940	920161	I'm still on the topic of pinata, by the way.
921081	922842	They still can't get over that pinata thing, huh?
922862	928325	We now have Grand Theft Pinata, Metal Gear Pinata, Katamari Pinata.
930706	930966	Fun.
931547	934648	They always take one gag a week and run with it, don't they, in chat?
935509	938030	You did not just bring up the Viva Pinata website over there.
941247	942188	Oh my god.
943528	944949	Oh, it does look like a Shrek ripoff.
944989	945249	Wow.
945949	946309	Yeah.
946530	947010	Well, we'll see.
947030	947750	I'll check it out later.
947770	948430	That's so funny!
948671	949351	I'll check it out later.
949371	949631	We'll see.
950311	951892	Anyway, I want to get on to another topic here.
952232	955113	Kotaku.com has recently posted some images.
955834	956034	What?
956857	960980	Pinata Mamie, 2DX I thought you were laughing at Kotaku.
961000	962261	I'm like, that's not very nice.
962301	963182	They're a respected site.
964503	975892	Kotaku.com recently posted some pictures, you have to go back to March 15th though, of the Game Boy Advance SP in pretty pink, now with a brighter backlit screen.
975992	980436	Or should I say, pearly pink is actually the color they're going for there.
982418	982858	I don't know.
983318	986341	Why do you think that they might be trying to release a pink Game Boy?
986823	989944	They're not getting enough female players.
989984	993225	Because all females buy anything that's pink.
993625	996246	It's just, it's bred into their DNA.
996766	998986	I know a lot of males that would be interested in the pink system.
1000287	1002467	I know a lot of males that would be interested in the pink system.
1002507	1009769	They're just, not the typical mindset that a lot of game companies cater to.
1009829	1010729	Let's just leave it at that.
1010749	1012710	My Game Boy Advance, however, was pink.
1013957	1017618	I did it just so that people couldn't pin me down to any one particular thing.
1018138	1018518	Gotcha.
1020439	1020659	Yeah.
1021119	1022239	I also have an afterburner in it.
1022799	1028720	Alright, I really only brought that up so we could tie into our next story that's going to be brought to us by DarkSakura.
1029000	1031341	Yep, it's actually our website of the week.
1031921	1033281	Ooh, our website of the week.
1033381	1034522	Well, here we go then.
1034562	1035702	Let's bring in the theme music.
1039738	1042999	You like to surf the internet and find a great website for us every week, don't you?
1043319	1048080	Actually, this one was linked to me by a friend of mine.
1048840	1057882	It's on The Escapist, and the article can be found at www.escapistmagazine.com slash issue slash 17 slash 27.
1058422	1062583	And it's, oh my god, girls don't exist on the interweb.
1062723	1063563	Exclamation point one.
1065043	1067023	And I'll go ahead and read off just the first paragraph.
1067063	1068984	It's by somebody named...
1069887	1070447	Whitney Butts.
1071528	1072728	I am a girl on the internet.
1072788	1073548	Yes, I said it.
1073628	1074428	A girl on the internet.
1074448	1075949	There really are quite a few of us.
1076109	1076709	I can type.
1076789	1078130	I can play games with the best of you.
1078590	1080490	And you, my friend, are about to get owned by a girl.
1082271	1096235	It's basically the story of somebody who's been playing World of Warcraft and no one believed that she was a girl or thought that she was like a girl speaking for her boyfriend on the chat or was like, you know, not.
1096555	1097235	She's very pretty.
1097356	1098436	There's a picture of her on the site.
1098476	1098636	She's
1099792	1105677	I read the article when you posted it on our secret place that we put all the stories up.
1106618	1108719	I read it and I thought it was very interesting.
1109860	1113083	The IRC conversations that she posted in those chat logs.
1113143	1115305	I was like, I actually wanted to do it.
1115325	1118367	We didn't have enough time to prepare it, but I actually wanted to do IRC theater.
1118827	1127370	We were going to interact the dialogue here, but it's just amazing the, for lack of a better word, stupidity of people.
1127450	1131211	My mother used to use this term a lot, and I hated it then, but it's the only way I can think of to describe this.
1131712	1137854	Hard-headedness of the youth that, OMG, she's a girl.
1137914	1139014	I got it on Rock and Rock.
1139795	1140655	It's just amazing.
1140675	1143716	It's either that or...
1147730	1152552	I would get it every so often back when I was a moderator on DDR Freak.
1152612	1155794	It was either, oh my god, you're a girl, or oh my god, you're not Asian.
1157755	1160436	Yeah, because that's a stereotype that only Asians play DDR.
1160576	1162317	Oh my god, you're not an Asian boy!
1164118	1165679	I actually got it when I played Tetranet.
1167067	1176614	But I would actually, when I used to list my video game collection on places, people go, you can't have all that because you're a girl.
1177354	1177635	Why?
1179496	1187662	Where is there some type of law that says I can't be good at video games and I can't enjoy video games because I have boobs and a uterus?
1188802	1190564	Okay, where is that law?
1190604	1192505	I'd like to see it so that I can set it on fire.
1194395	1206703	And you know what, it's interesting because there was also one of those IRC logs talked about where she responded that she said something about like, ooh, I really like Johnny Depp or something, and one of the people said, that's gay, what are you, gay?
1207143	1210465	And I was kind of like, so what if it was a gay person?
1210505	1219211	You know, obviously as a gay gamer myself, I face sometimes a lot of these same types of issues that you're bringing up as well where people like go,
1219751	1220991	Oh my gosh, you're actually gay?
1221031	1222992	And then they'll shut up for a long time.
1223532	1229974	Or sometimes I've gotten that where it's like, you're gay, you shouldn't be playing video games.
1230114	1234055	You should be being in a musical and listening to Barbra Streisand.
1234075	1237896	Let me be the first to tell you, I fucking hate Barbra Streisand.
1237996	1239877	I hate her, I hate her music, I hate her movies.
1240237	1241817	I hate everything about Barbra Streisand.
1241838	1243118	She's like butter.
1243718	1244878	No, she's like shit.
1245279	1247059	I don't like her at all.
1247459	1250400	My mom likes her a lot, but that's my mom.
1250440	1252421	It's those types of stereotypes I really hate.
1252481	1254141	It's like, so what if I'm gay?
1254181	1255982	I can play video games just like anybody else.
1256242	1257242	So what if you're a girl?
1258123	1259163	We've all got hands.
1259483	1261244	That's all you need to use a controller, right?
1262224	1266105	And apologies to any of you guys who might have had amputation or something.
1266445	1267686	There's devices for you too.
1268226	1271507	I've actually seen someone play with a joystick using their chin.
1273332	1276253	But there's also another thing I want to read on here.
1276794	1287999	You know, just because a girl plays video games doesn't necessarily mean she's going to instantly put her picture up on the internet for the male population to drool over because it's a woman that plays a game.
1288899	1292340	I'm going to go ahead and quote her on this again, if nobody minds.
1293421	1300184	Again, a girl who doesn't show her picture on the internet is not a girl, and the only girls on the internet are actually guys who are just trying to get free stuff.
1300584	1302625	Don't get me wrong, I haven't gotten free stuff before.
1302986	1305547	No, I have gotten free stuff before, but I don't solicit it.
1305867	1308849	Not like those, quote, girls who sit around dancing for tips and games.
1309550	1311611	You know who you are, and you know you're not a real girl.
1311691	1313152	Real girls don't exist on the internet.
1313192	1328241	Yeah, FYI, guys, if you think every girl that you run into in an MMO is actually a girl, just like if you assume that every guy you run into on an MMO is actually a guy, you are an idiot.
1329150	1330731	I've played male characters before.
1330791	1332692	And I've played female characters before.
1333112	1334993	And it's not because I'm gay.
1335733	1339155	On my Ragnarok account, I played a male so that I could play a bard.
1339835	1345158	How many of you guys out there, how many of you straight men out there, have ever played Street Fighter 2 as Chun-Li?
1346278	1347198	Did that make you gay?
1347859	1347999	No.
1348969	1349650	Thank you for watching!
1361178	1361939	Stop it.
1362239	1372105	But the whole thing just really gets me because, and I have, you know, being a female gamer, it's even worse though being a female gamer with a voice in the community though.
1372485	1379889	Because, you know, I've gotten some hate mail from people who have literally told me to get off the radio and get back in the kitchen.
1382591	1384572	What the fuck century is this?
1384672	1385573	Excuse me.
1386562	1396067	What backwards-ass country did you grow up in where they still have Neanderthals in charge banging women on the head and dragging them around by their hair to make them go cook them dinner?
1397568	1399609	No, seriously, DarkSakura is a pretty good cook.
1400029	1400909	I will give her that.
1401229	1405472	I am an excellent cook, but then again, you know, that's not the point.
1405592	1406512	I also don't clean house.
1407333	1408153	I make my husband do it.
1408213	1408973	I have a house husband.
1409213	1409454	All right.
1409594	1410174	No, for real.
1410614	1412055	No, but the thing is, you know,
1414832	1420154	Even my husband's friends are a bit surprised that I'll go in there every so often and play games with them.
1421195	1423216	And regularly own people.
1423816	1428338	I have to say, when Tekken 3 was out, I was the goddess of Tekken.
1428378	1429458	And I used to go in there.
1429678	1430619	And so humble about it.
1431099	1431459	It's true.
1431799	1434820	I used to go in there and smoke all the boys.
1434921	1436801	And they'd be like, oh my god, I got beat by a girl.
1437582	1439082	This is also Alabama, but still.
1439642	1443124	I remember going into Cyber Station one day, the same one I worked at.
1444179	1447421	and we had the brand new Deluxe Tekken 3 there.
1447781	1450563	And these guys have been there since the store opened at 9 a.m.
1450623	1451844	I show up at 2 in the afternoon.
1451864	1454505	They've been doing nothing but playing King all day, doing the throw combos.
1454905	1457147	I go in there with Jin and just knock him off the machine.
1458528	1462210	Didn't somebody actually tell you once, like, oh my god, it's the girl that plays Tekken?
1462250	1462530	Yes.
1462590	1466552	Like you're the girl, the only girl in the United States that's ever played Tekken.
1466572	1468313	I went back to Alabama.
1468714	1468954	Uh-huh.
1469978	1476160	and ran into somebody at the arcade and I was like, yeah, I used to come in here all the time and play Tekken.
1476381	1478041	Oh my god, you're that girl that plays Tekken!
1478862	1482123	Like, you're the only girl in the universe that's ever played Tekken.
1482243	1484904	Apparently I had been talked about for a little bit after I left.
1484944	1489666	I also was the one on campus who used to beat people on, because we had a Darkstalkers machine.
1489706	1490606	That used to be my game.
1490866	1491787	That and Killer Instinct.
1493267	1495028	But, you know, it gets me that
1495504	1498266	There's this whole thing that girls can't play games like that.
1498686	1501908	Either that or the girls who are like the uber sluts.
1502228	1507512	Well, this ties into the next article that I'm going to bring up here, which I'm sure will piss you off a little bit.
1508092	1508432	Here it is.
1508892	1512335	It's located at www.kimrom.info is the little blog.
1512695	1514516	And it's the blog post from March 8th.
1514996	1517538	And it goes, Female Gaming My Ass.
1519008	1528490	And I think I get the point that they're trying to make in this article because they talk about like, you know, they show these pictures, especially like here it is, like a girl website, a girl gaming website.
1529270	1534852	Quote, another great example of how female gaming attracts attention is a new team who calls themselves Can't Touch This.
1535232	1537392	The image below is their new homepage design.
1537772	1544194	And, you know, it's totally an exploitation of women's site and it's pink and it shows like a girl in a bikini, a little butt.
1544514	1548095	And I think what's kind of amusing is that they put a response like if it was a guy site.
1548911	1549391	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1571083	1574146	and I can totally see where this would piss someone off.
1574406	1575146	This is stupid.
1575327	1575607	It's right.
1575647	1588376	The sensationalism of girls playing video games just because they're girls and showing off the tits and everything and like OMG this is what a girl playing a game looks like and when you run into a girl team they're all going to be babes and stuff.
1588516	1591118	No, that's just that's stupid.
1591318	1592019	That's stupidity.
1592139	1593420	And I agree with that portion of the article.
1593440	1595421	How the hell are you going to operate the mouse if you're holding a gun?
1595502	1596402	That doesn't work.
1597103	1598023	Here's the problem.
1598744	1599464	The article
1600379	1607303	was written like, and this is my opinion here guys, but I think the article was written so trashy and so sensationalistic.
1607323	1610064	Let me give you a way that the article opens up here.
1611085	1613266	Men are better at computer games than women.
1613486	1614206	Big surprise.
1614366	1621610	We grow up playing games, we spend enormous amounts of time playing games, we consciously dedicate time to better ourselves, and we are competitive by nature.
1621710	1622871	No wonder we're better gamers.
1623591	1625212	And I'm thinking like, okay.
1627051	1633916	You've never seen a woman who's obsessed with soccer playing soccer, because those bitches are some of the most competitive women I've ever seen in my life.
1633996	1634836	I mean, seriously.
1635297	1640120	I mean, just these broad generalizations that the person's making here to open.
1640200	1652608	I don't know if they're doing this for shock value or something, but it just totally, like, when I read it and it opened up with that, it totally, like, I was like, okay, I don't even, even if there's a point in here somewhere, it's lost on me.
1653500	1654841	DarkSakura, I'm sure you felt similarly.
1655081	1656441	I did actually reply to this guy.
1657082	1657182	Oh!
1658462	1661163	He actually replied to me too, but he was just saying more of the same.
1661663	1671467	I listed an itemized bit, and actually what I first started off saying is I wasn't going to dignify this poor excuse for an editorial with a response, but perhaps I have a small responsibility to do so.
1671627	1673008	Nor were we going to talk about it on the show.
1673088	1673328	Oops!
1674948	1678930	But, you know, I think that this guy's idiocy should be pointed out because...
1679645	1682826	This is an attitude that's prevalent, though.
1682886	1688608	I understand wanting to see less of the, quote, hoochie gamers.
1689408	1694170	But it's like I pointed out, he's basically going from his male ego.
1694210	1695410	That's all he was speaking from.
1695811	1696471	Here's another quote.
1696491	1705394	But the real problem with female gaming is that female gamers in general have the same ambitions as men, but they lack the dedication and drive to fulfill those ambitions.
1706386	1707547	Um, what?
1711748	1713769	Let that quote speak for itself there.
1714049	1718611	I mean, it's just like, you know, I know plenty of women who are very high level.
1718651	1729615	In fact, there was just an article that was floating the internet this week about one of the girls who was on season seven of Buffy, one of the other Slayers, is secretly a level 60 character in World of Warcraft.
1730447	1731327	So I'm like, you know what?
1731487	1736109	Girls can have that ambition and drive to succeed in a game just like any guy.
1736429	1741911	But you can't ever say all girls and you can't ever say all men because you're going to be wrong.
1742091	1750494	One of my co-workers regularly talks to the guy in the cubicle across from me about her level, what, close to 70 character on World of Warcraft?
1751695	1755518	and she's been wanting me to pay for my accounts again.
1756298	1762082	I have a friend who's like the C-Mode goddess in Phantasy Star Online.
1762102	1764024	She just goes in there and smokes people.
1764884	1765585	Why is it?
1766245	1766646	Why can't...
1769344	1770384	Why do guys think this?
1770504	1777367	I mean, I'm not saying that all guys think this, but it does seem to be a pretty prevalent misconception among male gamers.
1777407	1790892	I mean, where did this... I honestly, and I hate to, I don't want to turn around the whole sexist thing myself, but I honestly think that a whole big chunk of it is male ego being threatened by women being able to do something.
1791332	1792673	No, some of it is.
1793933	1794393	I would agree.
1794493	1795293	As a guy, I would agree.
1795333	1796794	But granted, you know, whatever.
1796814	1798514	I guess my perspective on things is different.
1798534	1804336	But it sounds to me – and I understand this guy's underlying point is that maybe there's a little bit of – he's a little –
1806337	1808258	I don't want her representative of my fellow female gamers.
1836294	1837516	I'm going to go lay on this.
1837636	1839879	Anyway, form your own opinions.
1840199	1844826	I wanted to bring it up because, like it or not, it is an article that's been circulating a lot of the big news sites this week.
1844906	1846107	So check it out if you want.
1846288	1848791	Camerom.info and blog for March 8th.
1850243	1854965	I'm sure some of you guys want to respond to that, so we are going to open up our Skype line at this time.
1855025	1859407	If you guys want to give us a call, you can give us a call on our Skype line.
1859427	1867830	Just go to interactwithus on www.orangeloungeradio.com, or you can actually give us a telephone call as well.
1868750	1869930	The telephone number is 916-
1874513	1875254	and 226-9067.
1875634	1885840	Remember that that could be a toll call, so please ask the permission of whoever runs the line before you actually give us a call because there might be charges incurred.
1886181	1887101	Let's go to the phones.
1887141	1888222	Wow, they're lighting up tonight.
1888262	1890003	Let's start off with you.
1890063	1891224	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
1892945	1893165	Hi.
1894246	1894566	Hello.
1895126	1895667	Hi, who's this?
1898058	1900659	Raven's Dolphin Well, there's lots of games that come out for it.
1916038	1918779	There are a lot of games that come out for the PSP, I'll give you that.
1918819	1922980	But I'm going to be honest, there just hasn't been a whole lot that's really been that exciting to me.
1923020	1926941	But that's not to say that there isn't stuff coming up that's exciting to me.
1927021	1930523	Such as, well, the Mega Man games were just released, and I still need to check those out.
1930543	1931943	But of course, me and my Katamari.
1932783	1936464	Luminous, I named as my game of the year last year, was a PSP game.
1936965	1939345	So, you know, there are things to like about the PSP.
1939745	1941466	I just think that you can't...
1942726	1946147	It's not existing just to be a game system.
1946467	1956690	They're also trying to do a lot of other stuff with it, such as the built-in web stuff and the podcast downloads and the Flash being incorporated into it and the iToy and all that other stuff as well.
1957430	1959330	Oh, okay.
1959550	1961891	Was there anything else you wanted to say about that?
1962731	1963331	Yeah, I do.
1964091	1966012	I bought Mega Man, the two of them.
1967458	1968460	What did you think about that?
1968480	1970824	There's a little bit of lag, so just feel free to speak freely.
1970864	1971646	Give your thoughts on that.
1972507	1973309	I loved them both.
1973529	1975052	I thought Powered Up was the best.
1975432	1976815	Well, I'm definitely going to have to check it out.
1977476	1980562	Yeah, you can download maps from it from their own servers.
1981428	1997335	Well, that's kind of cool, and that's something, you know, that the DS doesn't do, is, like, the whole, like, I mean, it's just now starting to get into the online interactivity thing, so, you know, Nintendo still has a long way to grow in that department, but, of course, you know, Metroid Prime Hunters is exciting, but I like, you know, I like that idea of all the expansions and all that stuff.
1997735	1999896	But, anyway, Raven's Dolphin, thank you so much for the call.
1999936	2007259	We are going to have to go ahead and let you go, because we're getting a little too much lag there, but, and we got a lot of calls on the line tonight, so we want to go to another caller there, but...
2007679	2008900	Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
2008920	2009020	Hello?
2036772	2038033	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2039133	2039493	Hello?
2040254	2040634	Hello?
2040914	2041634	Hi, who's this?
2042515	2044356	Um, this is Speck.
2045076	2046397	Hi, Speck, what's on your mind?
2046437	2048698	There's a little bit of lag, so just go ahead and get your question out.
2049518	2052079	Well, sorry about this.
2053180	2054260	That's alright, what's on your mind, buddy?
2054421	2055281	Go ahead and get your question out.
2056072	2063594	Well, I do want to say that the biggest April Fool's joke was probably the Nintendo On, if you guys ever heard about that.
2063974	2065054	Tell us a little bit about this.
2065314	2067655	I vaguely remember this, but tell us about this joke.
2068435	2076377	It was someone had, right before E3, had put together this huge trailer saying what the revolution was.
2078457	2081398	Oh, I think, I think, wasn't this like kind of last year that they did something like this?
2081418	2085799	Yeah, this is like, um, I think around Tokyo Game Show, something like that?
2085819	2086739	Yeah, interesting.
2087079	2090640	So, so what do you, what in your mind made this the greatest April Fool's prank in your opinion?
2091300	2093700	Because it made people actually believed it.
2094601	2095181	I guess that's true.
2095221	2096781	It did run on a lot of gaming sites, so.
2096881	2098462	That's success if you're any joke.
2098502	2102122	That's the success of a joke, and one of many reasons why I hate April Fool's Day.
2102142	2104703	And, and also, Jamie, I just have,
2105467	2106809	One of my friends wanted to say something to you.
2107069	2107330	Okay.
2107510	2107810	Okay.
2108531	2109192	Sega rocks.
2110214	2110394	Huh?
2111475	2117063	I don't... Did... It was either DarkSakura rocks or fuck off.
2117123	2118786	I can't tell which one of the two it was.
2119467	2120848	He said Sega rocks.
2121209	2121569	Oh, okay.
2121750	2122030	So you rock.
2122050	2122351	Thank you.
2123683	2125084	All right, take care, buddy.
2125364	2125885	Have a good one.
2127727	2128587	All right, take care, buddy.
2128607	2129308	We've got to let you go.
2129548	2131930	We've got a lot of lag there, but thanks for calling in.
2131950	2133191	We've got some first-time callers tonight.
2133211	2133712	That's awesome.
2134112	2135293	Let's go to another call.
2136014	2137235	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2139697	2140477	Hello, caller, are you there?
2140518	2141518	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2143220	2144301	I think it says Sega Rocks.
2144321	2144981	That's still cool.
2146242	2146703	Oh, okay.
2147714	2152196	Okay, unfortunately I'm not hearing from this guy, so maybe your mic was down or something was going on there.
2152236	2154356	Let's go to another call.
2155737	2157077	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2158418	2158698	Hello.
2159098	2159678	Hi, who's this?
2161419	2162740	This is Nintendo Maniac 64.
2163100	2165541	Nintendo Maniac 64, what is on your mind?
2166721	2170983	I think Sakura likes me or something, I don't know.
2171143	2171803	She's saying woohoo.
2173153	2174134	I think you're fairly cool.
2174274	2176495	We're fans of you because you're fans of us.
2176595	2178316	That's why we cheer you when you come on.
2178396	2179257	So, what's up, buddy?
2180337	2184900	Um... Not much, except... Can I rant about this one friend of mine?
2185820	2186601	I suppose.
2186681	2187721	Is it gaming-related?
2189342	2190203	Mm, kinda.
2190283	2194805	He's... He's... Well, okay, he's a pretty big PS tool.
2195306	2197447	Okay, so tell us... Okay, get the rant out.
2199688	2200829	He just, like, always...
2201721	2204923	This is like Nintendo and Xbox, just like everyone else.
2205684	2207405	If it's not Sony, this is it.
2208325	2208566	Why?
2209987	2210647	I don't know.
2213749	2216131	Well, punch him in the face.
2216291	2221054	I don't know what else to tell you.
2221074	2223816	Has he ever actually played Microsoft or Nintendo products?
2225642	2228344	Uh, he played Pictochow, my dear.
2228585	2229765	Okay, that doesn't fucking count.
2229825	2231547	I mean, that's not even like a game.
2231847	2237351	You need to sit that boy down and tell him, you know what, you need to try it, or you need to S-T-F-U.
2238692	2242475	And you tell him that three boobs on the radio said that to him.
2243495	2244756	There's another thing I want to rant about.
2244836	2245377	Alright, hurry up.
2246478	2247719	He's basically a neo-Nazi.
2247839	2250821	Hide is my dog, hide is my dog, hide is my dog.
2251522	2252943	Isn't that a Bloomchen song?
2253003	2253523	Alright, forget it.
2253944	2256526	Alright, we gotta let you both go, buddy.
2256546	2257146	Have a good one.
2257646	2257967	Okay.
2258567	2259788	And kick that guy in the balls.
2260749	2262330	Let's go to one more call here.
2262750	2264051	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2264431	2264672	Hello?
2264992	2265952	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2266693	2267313	Oh, hi there.
2267494	2268034	Hi, who's this?
2269395	2269795	Funny Dale.
2269995	2270716	Hi, Funny Dale.
2270736	2271276	What's on your mind?
2272837	2276460	I was going to talk about the issue you had a few minutes ago about the female gamers.
2276600	2277501	By all means, go for it.
2278414	2294711	And the reason why you see these websites, the Frag Dolls and the PMS Clan all have these young supermodels is because, well, I hate to say this, but a good portion of the video game audience is a bunch of 15 year olds who, well, can't get laid.
2296313	2300718	And they shouldn't really be looking at porn, so the Frag Dolls are probably the closest thing.
2302069	2302509	You know what?
2302629	2303790	And I agree with that.
2303910	2310732	I totally agree with what you're saying, Funnydale, because it's apparent in what's happening with G4 TV as well, right?
2310972	2317854	Because it was supposed to be like a network for games, and it kind of turned into it's just geared at the young 15-year-old males and stuff who can't get laid, right?
2317914	2318374	It's the same thing.
2318614	2330378	But here's the problem I see with that, is that if gaming truly wants to open its audience to everyone, as you see that Nintendo is trying to do very badly, and granted, Nintendo doesn't sponsor any of this stuff,
2330658	2332379	But I'm talking about the gamer community as a whole.
2333159	2340903	If you want to be looked at as something other than a bunch of 15-year-old kids who can't get laid, this shit has to stop.
2342243	2347926	And that's what's really about, and I think that's why we're here kind of speaking out against it a little bit, is here to say, you know what?
2348649	2356154	Gamers come in all shapes, sizes, and types, and we like games, and we don't have to fit into these certain stereotypes.
2356214	2363299	And it's just another sign of how stereotypes hurt society, and that goes in all facets of life.
2363319	2371205	Why can't we go back to the wonderful flashback for me like 20 years ago, or maybe not even quite 20 years ago,
2371872	2375414	Let's go back to the time when gaming was real gaming.
2375894	2378496	We're talking the Nintendo World Championships.
2378656	2379116	God damn it.
2379396	2384839	Why can't we go back to simpler times where it was based on skill and not whether you're a man or a woman.
2385139	2388781	It's how well you're good at Super Mario Brothers, Rad Racer, and Tetris.
2388801	2390202	And when the Power Glove was so bad.
2390282	2392183	Yes, Kali, you were trying to get a point in there.
2392867	2400434	Well, the problem with the argument is that game publishers are there to make money, and they make money doing that.
2400494	2401494	Just look at MTV.
2402535	2411783	That's a good point, but also look at games like Tetris and Brain Training, and the PopCap games is another big one on the internet, PopCap.com.
2412103	2416868	Those games and those types of things really reach to such a broader audience.
2417128	2419490	I think the publishers have to be willing to take a risk once in a while.
2420177	2421879	Tetris is the exception
2443328	2446091	Well, as long as it makes the money, they'll keep on doing it.
2446371	2448133	And that's unfortunate, but it's true.
2448293	2448654	That's true.
2448694	2451517	But that's, you know, again, that's why I vote with my dollars.
2451857	2454640	It's a point that came up in Part A, you know, vote with my dollars.
2454660	2460387	I'm not going to continue to support these games that are all about, you know, the TNA.
2460887	2463290	So, well, maybe Dead or Alive, though, because that game's kind of fun.
2464261	2467503	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2495882	2497262	Spoiled Rotten Prisoners.
2497563	2501124	Now, seriously, it's really interesting.
2502364	2505625	Now when you go to prison, you actually might be able to play video games.
2506105	2506446	That's right.
2506746	2518490	Inmates in Oregon can purchase a plug-and-play console, kind of like a kiosk Nintendo, with 50 embedded games and are mounted to an LCD TV if they behave.
2518810	2522471	Plus, I don't know, it's just,
2523138	2528602	Really interesting that they're actually coming out with video games from inmates.
2528642	2535586	I mean, come on, they're in there for... Unless, unless they're playing really crappy games like, you know, E.T.
2535646	2536326	or something like that for the 2600.
2538038	2550465	What I thought was funniest about that article was that some stupid prison had allowed games like Grand Theft Auto and games where you're killing cops to actually be played until they realized what was actually in the game.
2550525	2554327	Oh my god, I didn't realize there was cop killing in Cop Killer the game.
2554387	2555688	You're tax dollars at work.
2557049	2559050	Is this a good thing, a bad thing?
2561608	2562389	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2586527	2591450	The thing is that I hear that this comes out to sort of combat prison riots.
2591550	2593292	It's to try and de-stress the prisoners.
2593652	2594813	But I'm kind of like, you know what?
2595754	2598015	You've got to figure out a different way to break up prison riots.
2598396	2600257	We shoot them with a shotgun to the face.
2600357	2601158	I mean, come on.
2601238	2602159	It's pretty simple.
2602239	2604200	Now we're getting into pretty radical politics.
2604280	2607563	But yeah, you've got to think of other ways to combat prison riots.
2607663	2609624	They're going to be rioting if they don't have a face.
2609904	2611646	Don't let them out of their cell if they're going to riot.
2613894	2618617	I like the running man, because Richard Dawson was a villain, and that's awesome.
2620118	2623761	One thing that's certainly villainous in its own way is spam on the internet.
2623781	2625422	You know you guys hate getting spam mail.
2625722	2626222	Well, guess what?
2626242	2634568	Now you can get spam on your Xbox 360, thanks to Burnout Revenge, who encourages you to send in-game clips to your friends.
2635289	2640212	And you even get achievement points when you do so, right, Loki, who spammed me last week with this?
2640831	2642032	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2665322	2669787	So, yeah, I think you guys need to be a little smarter when you're thinking of your achievement points, scales like that.
2669827	2672550	That's not an achievement in gameplay.
2672891	2674132	That's an achievement in whoring.
2674452	2677095	And to be honest, the replays are kind of retarded anyways.
2677155	2683823	I mean, I've made some pretty cool ones, but nothing like, oh my god, you have to see this, except for the glitch that I saw, but I couldn't record that.
2685293	2685573	All right.
2686414	2689956	Anyway, you got some hackin' and crackin' news, right, Loki?
2690436	2691016	Of course.
2691657	2698141	The first one, it's pretty major, actually, was that the Xbox 360 DVD firmware has been hacked.
2698241	2699201	And there's a video of it.
2699562	2711249	And basically, the way it works is all Xbox 360 games that come out there, of course, they're all encoded so that you can't reverse engineer them and stuff.
2711309	2712730	So that's something.
2713030	2714551	And plus, each single...
2716574	2720515	Their file type, XEX, has a media flag.
2720755	2725256	Basically, the media flag tells the Xbox what type of media it's on.
2725456	2729837	Whether that be a CD-R, DVD-R, DVD Plus R, etc.
2729957	2732718	Or DVD, Xbox, DVD, Xbox 360.
2733438	2735199	So it knows what type of media it's on.
2735539	2743261	So if, for example, I try to copy a game and I make a perfect copy and it's on a DVD-R, it's going to say, hey, this isn't a pressed CD.
2744261	2744781	I'm not playing it.
2746044	2750705	So what they did was they actually modified the DVD firmware not to make that check.
2750965	2754506	So if I make an exact copy of the game, it'll run like nothing.
2755426	2765328	Of course, as with all these exploits, the hacking group behind it is not releasing the firmware because they don't endorse piracy, they only endorse hacking.
2765548	2767989	So, okay.
2768469	2772150	So yeah, it's not going to be released, but it can be done.
2773339	2777340	Well, it's somebody else off to figure it out, I suppose, who doesn't endorse piracy, if that's what you're into.
2777580	2779360	Exactly, and here's my thing.
2779500	2783961	Because I remember back in the heyday, when I used to import games, I used to get HK copies.
2784401	2788242	Basically, these were mass-produced, pirated copies where they would be pressed.
2790043	2791763	Why aren't these floating around out there?
2792483	2799805	I mean, because if you can press an exact copy of the game, and it's on a DVD, I mean, shouldn't it work?
2800625	2800865	Maybe?
2800885	2801085	Mm-hmm.
2801744	2802184	I don't know.
2802845	2803305	Just a thought.
2803685	2804185	But anyways.
2806306	2809628	And of course some other cool stuff of course on the PSP.
2809688	2813290	The first one is this really strange stick minigame.
2813590	2816171	It's like with stick figures called Pointless Tormenting.
2817372	2818492	I like it already.
2819913	2822454	It's basically you torment stick figures.
2823775	2824675	It's just really simple.
2824975	2825716	It's kind of stupid.
2826356	2827316	But if you're interested in it.
2827456	2828497	Remember Stick Fighter?
2829226	2830226	Dick Fighter was kind of fun.
2830246	2831267	That's all I wanted to say.
2832807	2835889	It's on PSP updates, so you can check that out.
2836009	2836589	Pretty sweet.
2837009	2843972	Another kind of cool game is another homebrew game that's been, I think even on the Dreamcast, called Dragon Fighter.
2844072	2848654	It's kind of like a Final Fantasy fighting game, almost.
2848714	2851395	It has the really super deformed characters and stuff.
2851715	2856197	Anyways, Dragon Fighter version 0.2 was released on the PSP, so you can check it out.
2856756	2861499	I think actually some of the graphics were used from RPG Maker is what they based a lot of this on.
2861559	2862860	So check it out.
2862940	2863841	It might be something interesting.
2863881	2864581	It's free.
2865062	2866763	It's on PSP Updates as well.
2866903	2873508	Another one that I did find that was kind of neat was this game called Irkwan Masters.
2874108	2880172	And now if you remember way back in the day in DOS games, there was this game called Star Control, which is pretty sweet.
2880232	2885636	It was like a kind of a space shooter RPG type of thing.
2886280	2887840	Well, this is based on that.
2887980	2891922	And it's also based on another knockoff game called, of course, Irkon Masters.
2891982	2892622	But check it out.
2893282	2896363	They have version 0.50 available.
2896643	2897523	And it looks pretty sweet.
2897763	2902364	If it's anything like Star Control or Star Control 2 was, really fun shooter game.
2902404	2903985	So check it out.
2904545	2904885	All right.
2905640	2910303	We're now going to go ahead and let DarkSakura dive in and open up our mailbag.
2910343	2919489	When you guys send us letters to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, DarkSakura likes to dig through the mailbag and pick out a few favorites to make fun of here live on air.
2919909	2920569	I'm good at that.
2920649	2921350	No, just kidding.
2921490	2925752	She's going to give some serious responses with our help here to this week's letters.
2925953	2927113	So let's open up the mailbag.
2927694	2928994	Who sent us some mail this week?
2931296	2934098	Sipspon wrote in and said...
2935373	2937314	I've got another suggestion for the show.
2937434	2940836	How about making a question for the listener call-in section?
2941337	2945119	As it seems to me now, the call-in part is really people just doing a shout-out or whatever.
2945179	2946800	There doesn't seem to be any real structure.
2947460	2952183	If you were to pose a question early in the show, listeners would have time to think about answers and could call in and discuss.
2953001	2957143	I think it's okay to have random calls and shoutouts, but it's not very interesting unless you have something to say.
2957203	2957683	What do you think?
2959964	2965147	I think that's a good idea, but I think I see a lot of other podcasts that kind of do that.
2965727	2969108	Although I don't see a whole lot that are interactive in that way.
2969649	2971610	A lot of them do it through email and things like that.
2972430	2977432	And I kind of always, at least my envision of the show, is that things be like an open format.
2977472	2981114	And if somebody had a topic they wanted to bring to us, they could do that on the Skype line.
2981274	2983216	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3011667	3012487	Call Echo 123 so we don't hear this.
3012507	3012587	Hi!
3027714	3029035	We keep one in the closet.
3053496	3054197	WTF WTF WTF WTF
3074144	3075084	but it's a cool game.
3075424	3076585	It really is a cool game.
3076885	3078085	So, you know what?
3078105	3079065	It's a different art style.
3079106	3081546	It's just like people going, what the hell happened to Link?
3081926	3084307	He looks all cel-shaded and funky looking.
3085187	3086008	It's still a good game.
3087048	3100332	Well, except for the fact that the world was flooded and then when you go to one spoiler part of this game when you see Hyrule's underwater, you're like, why couldn't it have been that game?
3100372	3103393	You know, where Hyrule's not underwater, but whatever.
3103633	3103853	Oh, well.
3105431	3106072	And more emails?
3107253	3107854	Actually, yes.
3108134	3109635	There is an email from Lauren.
3109655	3113559	It says, hey, I'm looking at full metal DDR pads on eBay.
3113639	3121026	It looks like you can buy one for between $100 to $500 plus, but I was wondering if you knew which manufacturers are the more dependable, Blade, Ion, etc.
3122407	3126271	One of these ones is, I think it's the one that they were selling at Fry's.
3128127	3129728	Oh, I've seen that pad before there.
3130008	3131168	It was broken when I used it.
3131208	3131708	Here's the thing.
3131808	3133009	There's the problem with it right there.
3133049	3134970	You see how it says, what is this one we're looking at here?
3135350	3136350	The eBay one?
3136370	3137551	Who makes this one?
3137571	3139031	Gus, I can't find the manufacturer.
3139051	3140052	Let me put it this way.
3140132	3142272	I've bought a metal eBay pad.
3142292	3145974	Okay, the ones that are like an inch thick or something.
3146554	3147754	And that sucker bent.
3149295	3150976	The one that I was at E3, my...
3152648	3153648	Iguana Girl got injured on.
3176737	3180181	You know Guitar Hero is pretty rockin' and they do make some solid controllers.
3180981	3183564	Honestly, the Afterburner is the place to be for that.
3184144	3186106	Their stuff has always been high quality.
3186206	3186427	Yeah.
3188268	3189449	Except for one particular game.
3189490	3192993	In my opinion, but other people feel differently, so that's just my opinion.
3193273	3194274	Or build your own.
3195936	3199559	We also have the last two emails are from our friend Rob.
3200120	3200420	Rockin'.
3201817	3207801	To read this, a friend asked me to advise on streaming HDTV to his TV from his PC, so I looked it up.
3207881	3216847	If you go to a Windows MCE route, there are two Microsoft devices they recommend, the Xbox 360 and Windows Media Extender.
3217387	3224152	On the Microsoft page for MCE, Windows Media Extender is downplayed almost completely in favor of the Xbox 360.
3224552	3226213	They really want to push those boxes.
3227994	3228795	Interesting point.
3228875	3229095	Mm-hmm.
3230230	3234413	And then the other thing is actually a link from, I guess it's Gamasutra.
3236194	3243178	There is an article here about ESA files to retrieve Illinois bill game legal costs.
3243559	3248782	Ah, yes, the legal, you know, I've got to admit, I've been trying to stay on what's going on with the bill.
3249262	3253004	The Game Industry Trade Association with the Entertainment Software Association has filed a petition to the United States Department
3272555	3280466	District Court asking it to order the state of Illinois to pay $644,545 in legal fees for its unsuccessful efforts to enact a law banning the sale of violent video games in the state.
3287773	3288053	All right.
3316801	3317223	Sorry.
3317483	3318387	Pay them up, Illinois.
3318989	3319390	You heard me.
3320414	3324856	If you've got some emails you want to send along, mailbag at orangeloungeradar.com is the place to do it.
3324916	3325977	That's all one word, mailbag.
3326597	3328237	Let's move on to some more news.
3328298	3332219	And of course, you know I couldn't get through a show without bringing up something related to Final Fantasy XI.
3333100	3340243	There's new information coming out about Treasures of Ott, Oregon, thanks to the event that happened recently there.
3341023	3343124	What was that in, I want to say Santa Cruz?
3343144	3344204	I know it was somewhere in California.
3344244	3345865	They had this big event, a live event.
3345905	3348086	They showed the new trailer and everybody was cheering.
3348464	3350425	Well, there's some new information on what's coming with the game.
3350445	3354027	And this sounds like it's going to be a much more thorough expansion than Chains of Promethea was.
3354287	3356929	Chains of Promethea was like, new missions, new areas.
3357089	3357569	Woo!
3357929	3359910	But this is a whole lot of new stuff.
3360371	3361431	Besieged mode.
3361471	3364453	This is where the enemies are going to start taking over the towns.
3364933	3367215	and you actually fight to keep over the town.
3367255	3367976	I think that's kind of neat.
3368456	3370198	There's also going to be an assault mode.
3370919	3377244	This is where if you're over level 50, you can just play for an hour or so and you don't have to assemble a giant party.
3377264	3379266	You just go to take a huge quest.
3379546	3381048	This is a direct response to...
3381608	3383830	It takes me too long to find a flippin' party.
3384750	3387753	I want to do something casually that doesn't take me all night long.
3388073	3396119	So I think that's a good idea, except for the fact that it's limited to over level 50, because that kind of defeats the purpose in many ways, because it takes a while to get to level 50.
3396159	3400742	We're not even going to talk about breaking the 50 cap and how hard that is.
3400962	3405623	We'll wait and see how that turns out before we make our final decisions on that.
3406543	3409684	Also, we do know that there's going to be a brand new job class.
3409744	3418346	The Puppet Master is going to be a new job class along with the previously announced Corsair, who you might as well call a pirate, and Blue Mage that were previously announced.
3419367	3420047	Puppet Master?
3420640	3421140	I think so.
3421361	3423302	I don't remember if it was Puppeteer or Puppet Master.
3423322	3423923	Puppet Master.
3424023	3424643	Is it Puppet Master?
3424863	3428706	That just now has me thinking of a person with little creepy puppets going around.
3428866	3429967	That's actually what it is.
3430027	3430628	That's what it is.
3430648	3431248	That's cool.
3431308	3431568	Yeah.
3432009	3436172	Oh my, whoa, we got DarkSakura to say something complimentary about Final Fantasy XI.
3436212	3437273	Someone note the date and time.
3437293	3437933	Stop pointing at me.
3438154	3439334	You're scary.
3439354	3440055	But you know what?
3440115	3443157	We've had village raids for years in Ragnarok Online.
3443177	3445039	Yeah, but that's just the GMs playing tricks on you.
3447634	3449695	Anyway, also, this is very cool as well.
3450716	3456178	Chocobo racing is going to be incorporated into Final Fantasy XI along with breeding.
3456518	3462781	So those of you guys that love to raise your own Chocobos in Final Fantasy VII, now it's going to be incorporated into Final Fantasy XI.
3463201	3464082	That is pretty cool.
3464122	3465062	I've got to say my hat's off to them.
3465082	3466003	Can you get a black one?
3466123	3466963	Can you get a gold one?
3467043	3467703	I have no idea.
3467803	3468744	We won't know until it comes out.
3468764	3470425	Do you have to race them at the gold saucer?
3470885	3471185	I don't know.
3471943	3472303	Colosseum
3494195	3495936	Don't really know what it's going to be yet.
3496176	3498238	They just said a Colosseum.
3498558	3509565	Well, they have PvP and Ballista, so we don't know if it's going to be PvP or if it's going to be like, think about Final Fantasy VI had a Colosseum, and you would kind of bet an item, and then depending on if you won, you would get something better.
3509885	3510425	So who knows?
3510465	3511586	It could be a variety of things.
3512046	3513067	So we shall see.
3513367	3514187	So pretty exciting.
3514227	3516388	And this is an addition to new areas and stuff.
3516428	3525112	So it sounds like Final Fantasy XI is learning from the poor reviews of Chains of Promethea and kind of adding a lot more oomph into this expansion.
3525152	3526552	It's going to get some people back into the game.
3527152	3527673	Here I come.
3529013	3529433	Enough said.
3529814	3532054	Well, that's not the only thing Square's working on, though, right?
3532175	3533375	I should say Squeenix.
3533575	3535556	They're working on another MMO.
3537213	3538434	What's this?
3538494	3539634	Well, it's just a brand new MMO.
3539874	3543636	It's not going to be Final Fantasy related.
3543656	3545877	Dragon Quest Online.
3546157	3549318	But other details beyond that, nothing.
3549799	3552300	They just know that they're working on it.
3554244	3555424	So Final Fantasy XIII?
3555905	3556385	Probably not.
3556885	3558025	It could be Final Fantasy.
3558045	3558586	It could be something else.
3558826	3559866	I did remember hearing them.
3560466	3563287	They were working on another game, and I do remember seeing something about this.
3563628	3564688	It wasn't Final Fantasy.
3564808	3566168	I can't remember what it was, though.
3566589	3567849	Something that was at E3 last year.
3567909	3570430	I seem to remember vaguely hearing something about this, too.
3570510	3572831	So I wonder if this is related or if it's something completely different.
3573771	3574091	I don't know.
3574512	3576232	But, yeah.
3576712	3577193	We'll see.
3578033	3578293	All right.
3580411	3581434	We're going to move on here.
3581494	3589010	Now, I know that I don't get a Website of the Week segment here on this show, but let's pretend for once that I did get a Website of the Week segment.
3592031	3592752	You're just jealous.
3592852	3593052	Scandal.
3613638	3621264	Take a stand against politicians who come up with these harebrained bills about preventing the violent video games.
3621804	3624386	Once in a while, depending on the wording of the bill, it can be okay.
3624406	3629530	But I'm talking about the cases where they compare the games to pornography and all that stuff.
3629990	3632671	So, you know, I've been saying throughout the past couple shows, vote with your dollars.
3632691	3634311	Well, now here you can vote with your votes.
3634631	3643334	And it's basically a place to get people mobilized for action in the political world in the name of gaming.
3643354	3644234	And I think it's great.
3644754	3647775	And here's a little quote from the website about what they're all about there.
3648275	3649376	Video Game Voters Network
3674973	3675794	Protect Your Games.
3675834	3678295	That's www.videogamevoters.org.
3678755	3680816	I urge you to sign up for this site.
3681597	3688700	Even if you don't agree with all of it, maybe you'll find that once you've read it, you don't agree with everything maybe that they're going to do, at least you're educated.
3689541	3690781	And knowing is half the battle, right?
3691422	3691922	Yo, Joe.
3692307	3694248	So bravo to those guys for starting that up.
3694268	3699391	I think it's a good idea to get everybody together to take action against this stuff and speak up and say, you know what?
3699891	3702753	Gamers aren't a bunch of 15-year-old guys who can't get laid.
3702773	3716760	There's a lot of gamers over 18 who are voting you guys in office, and if you're going to continue to be ignorant about gaming, which is what a lot of this stuff ends up being, is ignorance about gaming, then we're going to remove you from office and put someone in there who's not as ignorant.
3717881	3718321	Good idea.
3719597	3721418	Any last minute stories anyone wants to share?
3721438	3722399	But of course!
3722519	3723959	Alright, what's up?
3724200	3743890	Kind of on the same level as Half-Life 2, Survivor for the arcade, Global VR, developer of arcade machines, has announced a new title for conversion to the arcade play, and that would be Ubisoft's Far Cry Instincts, the console version for the Far Cry series.
3744631	3748393	Crisis is coming to the arcade.
3748809	3749509	I have one for you, Rob.
3749549	3749589	Oh.
3749649	3751370	About Sid Meier.
3751390	3751470	Cool.
3771269	3778594	A new PC game that will allow you to build your very own rail network laying tracks and deciding routes and designing trains called Railroads!
3778774	3779555	With an exclamation point.
3779635	3780996	Wait, but there was Railroad Tycoon.
3782277	3783617	It wasn't Sid Meier's Railroad.
3783637	3784138	Okay, fine.
3784178	3784818	Alright, so fine.
3784878	3785239	Railroads.
3785479	3787200	It's titled Sid Meier's Railroads.
3787340	3787680	Alright.
3787740	3791543	It's a click and drag system to lay tracks, bridges, tunnels, blah blah blah.
3792568	3801292	You can also, not only as your rail network grows, cities, industries, you organize cargo transport, provide passenger routes for commuters.
3801532	3802333	Fend off hobos.
3802833	3803293	Stop it.
3805334	3811097	You'll need to basically watch the business side as you are also dealing with the technical side.
3811157	3812397	You know who will like this game a lot?
3812517	3812897	My dad.
3813057	3814238	Because he used to work for the railroad.
3814278	3816899	He's retired now, but he worked for the railroad, so he loves these types of things.
3817279	3818540	I'll share this with him.
3818871	3825977	You also have the ability to make your own maps and scenarios and do your dream layout in train table mode.
3827599	3831442	And you can also challenge historical figures like Cornelius Vanderbilt and J.P.
3831482	3831802	Morgan.
3833384	3837627	Okay, that's kind of interesting because it's like the civilization aspect there in railroading.
3837667	3837928	That's cool.
3837948	3842091	And it has LAN or online play, competitive, cooperative.
3843312	3844874	So it's going to be pretty big.
3846519	3861274	Railroad Tycoon is one of those great classic games that you should definitely check out if you're kind of younger or into gaming or whatever and haven't checked out a lot of old PC gaming titles that are just fabulous.
3862015	3863557	Civilization, definitely check that out.
3864498	3866119	and Railroad Tycoon is great.
3866159	3867240	Oh, this game looks very pretty.
3867280	3868461	That's cool.
3868521	3870363	I hope it's easy to get into though.
3870383	3874626	The problem with a lot of these PC sim type of games is that the learning curve is way too high.
3874987	3877349	But hopefully this will be easy to get into.
3877409	3880952	And Civilization, at least the original one, had a pretty good learning curve on it.
3881012	3883214	Civ 2 and 3 were pretty good too.
3883274	3884735	So I have faith that this will be good.
3885056	3886437	It's looking pretty awesome so far.
3886457	3889940	I mean, I probably wouldn't be too into playing it, but it looks pretty cool.
3890527	3890807	SSJ100 Matt
3911986	3912786	One of them is
3930566	3938552	This 15 year old student from Salem, Virginia recited 8,784 digits of pi from memory on Tuesday.
3939012	3944536	His father promised to buy him an Xbox 360 if he succeeded his own personal goal, which was 10,790.
3944876	3951421	He was actually trying to set the world record, which was...
3952407	3953588	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3978772	3980934	So he can't even download something off Xbox Live Arcade.
3980974	3982315	He just gets a core.
3982375	3987159	Ironically enough, $10,790 is how many systems that were actually sold in Japan.
3987680	3988180	Stop it.
3990422	3991183	You know what, though?
3991463	3998369	In the time it took him to learn to memorize that, the kid could have gone out and gotten a job and gotten the money to buy this Xbox 360, don't you think?
3998830	3999230	I guess it was.
3999270	3999751	He's 15.
3999791	4000391	Maybe he can't work.
4000812	4002613	You can get a work permit at that age, can't you?
4003494	4004735	Hell yeah.
4005015	4005536	Get a job!
4007093	4007533	Foname
4030894	4037759	DarkSakura will bake some pies since after all the emails do say you should be in the kitchen, right?
4039000	4040662	I'll bake arsenic pie.
4059289	4060392	I might go down for a day.
4065987	4067708	That's going to about wrap it up for tonight's program.
4067848	4068749	And ribbons and bows.
4068989	4073051	A few quick programming notes for you guys, for those of you guys that listen to Orange Lounge Radio 24-7.
4073091	4077014	Just so you know, Pump Up the Volume will not be heard this week.
4077634	4078995	Because of Comcast.
4079075	4079535	That's right.
4079756	4083078	However, I did get The Ultimate Geek as my tech, and he was awesome.
4083518	4083918	That's cool.
4083978	4086219	And then the guy who came to... He might be listening to the show tonight.
4086240	4086560	Who knows?
4087000	4093024	He actually did... Well, I wouldn't say he's like a geek geek, but he's into the same type of... He likes Monty Python and... That's cool.
4093384	4094425	And George Romero.
4094545	4094685	Yeah.
4096131	4097031	He was really awesome.
4097051	4103536	If you were listening, I totally forgot what your name was because I actually do want to send a compliment to your boss.
4104097	4107699	So if you are listening, email me at jamie at orangedownsradio.com.
4107779	4110161	I will totally write a letter of commendation to your boss.
4110381	4112683	But also, he needs to fix your line.
4113003	4113584	It's not him.
4113664	4114344	We found out what it is.
4115345	4119148	In fact, the tech who came over, the first thing he did was go in and pet Shermie.
4120073	4120954	I was like, you're cool.
4121574	4124676	I've had nothing but good from Comcast lately, even though my service hasn't been great.
4124776	4133120	When Loki and I lived together, we had a tech come over to the place that we were living at, and the guy walked into the room and saw the arcade machine that Loki had built, and was like, what do you guys do here?
4133180	4134701	Dude, I still get stuff.
4134801	4141165	I get, you know, people, like, I order pizza, and he's like, didn't you used to live on, yeah.
4141325	4143466	Because they recognize the arcade cabinet, and
4144907	4146608	I remember when you guys were building that.
4147929	4149349	That's pretty cool.
4149550	4159035	But I would like to say, what happened is that in my neighborhood, someone cut the head line of a fiber optic cable, cost them $10,000 to repair it.
4159055	4159715	What a bunch of jerks.
4160195	4167340	Yeah, and so we were all out of service, and what's happening is that while they're effecting the repairs and putting everything back together, we've been having really erratic service.
4167540	4178148	So, I've been told to give it a week for it to clear up, so as a result, so that you guys don't have to put up with the crap that happened last week, I am not doing a show this Tuesday, I will be back the next week.
4178308	4185033	Alright, but I will be on Wednesday night with the Rob Roberts show, so for some music and some geek chat and stuff, and, uh, you know, uh, whatever else...
4185979	4186439	comes up.
4186479	4188280	We'll let you know about it on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
4188320	4191782	For now, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts, starting off with Loki.
4193323	4193803	My bad.
4193903	4197325	I completely forgot something I wanted to talk about, and I'll make it really quick.
4197345	4197945	Make it quick.
4198445	4199406	We have to talk about this.
4199466	4200646	DDR Supernova.
4200746	4204908	It was at the ASI event that was going on, and there was some new stuff.
4205949	4211451	One thing, of course, Betson, the manufacturer of this, said no upgrade units will be available.
4211531	4212712	It's all new hardware.
4212732	4214113	You can buy it straight, you know.
4215317	4223880	They did show videos that were recorded at the event of the new songs, including Healing Division and also Chaos.
4224200	4230862	Chaos, which has four goddamn billion tempo changes and stops in it, including 164th stops, so it's
4233598	4234719	DarkSakura, your final thought?
4263063	4267026	I have very conflicting emotions toward Comcast right now.
4267206	4269007	And reject false icons.
4269127	4269888	Guitar Vader!
