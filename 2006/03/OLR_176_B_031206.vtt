00:15.000 --> 00:19.600
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.600 --> 00:26.600
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. We're here on this March the 12th of 2006 with episode number 176.

00:26.600 --> 00:29.880
We had a pretty exciting first half there, talking about all sorts of stuff, the new

00:29.880 --> 00:35.000
PSP, talking about patching on the Xbox 360, and we're going to kick off this segment with

00:35.000 --> 00:36.260
some more news.

00:36.260 --> 00:38.720
Going over to the Xbox 360, Loki?

00:38.720 --> 00:44.160
Yeah, they're saying there's a story going out on most of the gaming sites out there

00:44.160 --> 00:47.920
about foil and how it ruined the 360.

00:47.920 --> 00:55.780
Apparently, on the graphics processor heatsink, there is a foil layer left on there, and one

00:55.780 --> 01:05.000
German sites out there on the Xbox scene forums he actually opened up his 360 to

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
show that the foil was still on there and saying that the foil left on there

01:10.000 --> 01:16.080
on the the heat transfer pad is basically acting like a skillet I guess

01:16.080 --> 01:22.340
and instead of a heatsink so no basically that's kind of backing up the

01:22.340 --> 01:29.260
whole you know heatsink over the GPU overheating and that's what caused the

01:29.260 --> 01:35.180
Xbox 360 to stop working and yeah I know that one do you think Microsoft is gonna

01:35.180 --> 01:41.620
replace that one well here's basically no the guy that cracked it open oh no no

01:41.620 --> 01:47.620
that they basically there's a follow-up by Microsoft and they've come out with

01:47.620 --> 01:51.480
this it's saying, the video posted by the German blog

01:51.480 --> 01:56.860
gamesstore24.de shows the thermal interface pads that are installed per

01:56.860 --> 01:59.440
specification. This foil eliminates the need

01:59.440 --> 02:04.600
of a protective liner which simplifies the final assembly process and minimizes

02:04.600 --> 02:06.640
shipping concerns and contamination

02:06.640 --> 02:10.740
issues. Whatever the hell that's supposed to mean. Then of course they go on to say

02:10.740 --> 02:12.400
that opening your case voids your

02:12.400 --> 02:16.640
warranty yada yada yada. No, I thought it enhanced it.

02:16.640 --> 02:20.080
I thought opening it up and it was full of cookies.

02:20.080 --> 02:22.520
I thought that let the gnomes come out to play.

02:22.520 --> 02:25.280
Stop looking at my shirt!

02:25.280 --> 02:27.040
I love your underpants gnome shirt.

02:27.040 --> 02:28.040
Thank you.

02:28.040 --> 02:34.040
Now the whole thing is, is it, you know, is the foil actually causing this thing to overheat?

02:34.040 --> 02:35.040
We don't know.

02:35.040 --> 02:36.040
That's what it comes down to.

02:36.040 --> 02:38.280
It's just another article out there because...

02:38.280 --> 02:40.760
It gives better heat spread so you can cook better.

02:40.760 --> 02:48.280
Now, I personally think that it doesn't because I guess if you had something on, you know,

02:48.280 --> 02:52.160
most of the time like for CPUs and stuff when you're talking like an actual PC, you have

02:52.160 --> 02:58.520
thermal paste in between, some manufacturers will use foil instead because it also allows

02:58.520 --> 03:02.800
heat transfer from the CPU to the heat sink.

03:02.800 --> 03:08.600
Well this foil got in the way of that, it possibly could, you know, inhibit the heat

03:08.600 --> 03:14.780
transfer a little bit and that could cause overheating or you know the foil was meant

03:14.780 --> 03:20.020
to be there who knows we don't know all we know is that something was overheating something

03:20.020 --> 03:25.580
no worky something after the sky very angry when sky get broken xbox 360 and have to send

03:25.580 --> 03:30.480
it back that's for sure if it's not this thing it's something else you know all we need to

03:30.480 --> 03:35.100
know is that it it wasn't working and it's hopefully being fixed and they're hopefully

03:35.100 --> 03:38.520
going to get the units out there so we can hopefully buy one all right we'll see we'll

03:38.520 --> 03:44.540
Well hopefully Sony is learning from some of these bugs and it looks like they are on

03:44.540 --> 03:50.280
the first steps to getting these machines, the PlayStation 3 is being made, maybe, I

03:50.280 --> 03:54.880
mean it's kind of take this with a grain of salt, but the Chinese website MyDrivers

03:54.880 --> 04:00.360
has reported that a Taiwan manufacturer Compec has received the orders from Sony to start

04:00.360 --> 04:08.480
producing the PCI PCB, this would be the printed circuit board for the PlayStation 3.

04:08.480 --> 04:12.420
There is no official announcement from Compaq, but the rumor says that this is going into

04:12.420 --> 04:15.280
production June or July of this year.

04:15.280 --> 04:19.560
If you are taking this with a grain of salt, just know that MyDrivers is a pretty reputable

04:19.560 --> 04:24.400
Chinese website, but you know, don't take anybody's word for it until you hear it from

04:24.400 --> 04:27.880
Sony directly, I suppose, with the PlayStation 3.

04:27.880 --> 04:31.920
Sounds like it may be on its way after all, at least the first few steps to getting that

04:31.920 --> 04:33.600
done.

04:33.600 --> 04:35.320
And let's go over to a Nintendo story.

04:35.320 --> 04:36.320
Why not?

04:36.320 --> 04:38.960
Sakura, what's new on the Nintendo DS?

04:38.960 --> 04:40.200
A bunch of stuff.

04:40.200 --> 04:44.280
But in this particular, there's a new RPG on the way for the DS.

04:44.280 --> 04:48.300
It's called Contact, and it's a game

04:48.300 --> 04:51.500
about hunting, cooking, fishing, training, collecting,

04:51.500 --> 04:53.320
and romance.

04:53.320 --> 04:54.480
Whoa, hold on a second.

04:54.480 --> 04:56.560
Hunting, training, fishing, all that stuff.

04:56.560 --> 04:57.880
That reminds me of Oregon Trail.

04:57.880 --> 05:00.480
Oregon Trail with love.

05:00.480 --> 05:01.120
With humping.

05:01.120 --> 05:02.800
With making babies.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.640
What?

05:04.640 --> 05:09.080
I hope. You play as someone named Terry

05:09.080 --> 05:12.980
you meet a professor whose spaceship has crashed on a weirdo planet

05:12.980 --> 05:16.880
and you have to collect cells which are the power source for the ship and

05:16.880 --> 05:20.000
they're all over the place you have to go find them.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.080
As you're going you train animals, collect items, play a bunch of mini games

05:24.080 --> 05:30.560
there's real-time combat there's a an online version but they haven't said

05:30.560 --> 05:31.820
anything about how that's gonna work

05:31.820 --> 05:38.720
It's being produced by Goichi Suda who is the director of Killer7 and the characters

05:38.720 --> 05:44.440
were designed by Atsuko Fukushima of Popola Cross.

05:44.440 --> 05:47.000
That makes me happy.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.360
There is actually an official site up for it too and it's going to be published by Atlas

05:52.360 --> 06:01.560
in the U.S. No UK release date stated as of yet although they know that it's in development

06:01.560 --> 06:05.120
by Marvelous Interactive and Rising Star

06:05.120 --> 06:08.680
tends to bring over their games in Europe so there's hope for

06:08.680 --> 06:13.560
our European audience. The artwork I have to say though after looking

06:13.560 --> 06:16.400
through the Japanese site it is pretty awesome

06:16.400 --> 06:19.640
I'm looking forward to it. Sounds cool. Loki!

06:19.640 --> 06:23.280
We touched on some new stuff on Xbox Live

06:23.280 --> 06:25.940
during the first half of the show but set the record straight for us what's

06:25.940 --> 06:27.040
going on on Xbox Live?

06:27.040 --> 06:30.480
A couple new things are coming out actually

06:30.480 --> 06:33.960
first being the outfit the demos hit

06:33.960 --> 06:37.280
Xbox Live you can do multiplayer on there

06:37.280 --> 06:40.600
or split-screen multiplayer those are the only things available

06:40.600 --> 06:45.060
for right now but definitely worth checking out and of course Ridge Racer 6

06:45.060 --> 06:49.120
demo is now on Xbox Live so you can also check that out as well

06:49.120 --> 06:53.800
not a big fan of those type of games like the outfit but I'll probably check

06:53.800 --> 06:57.400
it out because hey it's free and I heard our buddies over at All Games are really

06:57.400 --> 06:59.840
into it and I was listening to their show and they seem really into it

06:59.840 --> 07:05.500
The whole thing reminds me of kind of like G.I. Joe, sort of the whole...

07:05.500 --> 07:06.500
The whole...

07:06.500 --> 07:07.500
Well when you put it that way it sounds kind of cool.

07:07.500 --> 07:08.500
Now you know!

07:08.500 --> 07:14.120
The way the outfit is, I mean, because it's kind of like this, you know, over-exaggerated

07:14.120 --> 07:19.680
like World War II action game where you can call in reinforcements and weapons and stuff

07:19.680 --> 07:22.760
like that and you have all these vehicles that you're riding around in.

07:22.760 --> 07:25.540
It just seems very, I don't know, it seems pretty fun.

07:25.540 --> 07:28.840
I heard that you kind of control a team of four, and I like games where I get to be the

07:28.840 --> 07:33.600
boss so you know maybe I will have to check it out even though war games are

07:33.600 --> 07:37.200
usually not my type of thing of the battle whatever the hell I I I'll give

07:37.200 --> 07:40.620
it a fair shot hell I tried battlefield 2 which is so not my kind of game and I

07:40.620 --> 07:44.740
was very lost when I played it but you know gotta try it get can't knock it

07:44.740 --> 07:47.760
till you tried it right you left yourself way open for a joke shut up not

07:47.760 --> 07:51.400
to shut it right there but why did why did what what right do you have being on

07:51.400 --> 07:57.000
this show tonight are you even a gamer I am okay what was the last game you

07:57.000 --> 08:03.240

08:03.240 --> 08:07.140
all right fine I'm just giving you a hard time bugs my buddy I've known him

08:07.140 --> 08:10.740
forever 17 years I had to put up with your show I shut up all right put up

08:10.740 --> 08:15.620
with mine so Loki I'm going back over to you what do you got on Silent Hill

08:15.620 --> 08:21.460
they're working on the Silent Hill 3 team they're working on a new project

08:21.460 --> 08:28.100
for PlayStation 3. Duh. So like Silent Hill 5 most likely? Or maybe something

08:28.100 --> 08:33.460
different? Yeah. We just know they're working. They're hard at work again. Yeah.

08:33.460 --> 08:39.460
And tomorrow the sun will come out! I mean seriously how stupid of a sort.

08:39.460 --> 08:44.980
It's the third release of Silent Hill 2. They're making another in a really

08:44.980 --> 08:48.380
successful franchise that has a movie coming out that's probably gonna be one

08:48.380 --> 08:50.940
of the first video game movies is actually good.

08:50.940 --> 08:51.940
It's going to be final hill.

08:51.940 --> 08:53.260
No, they're making a sequel?

08:53.260 --> 08:56.740
Oh my god, that's such a shocker.

08:56.740 --> 08:57.740
Did you know what?

08:57.740 --> 09:03.020
Mario Brothers is going to be on the revolution when that comes out too.

09:03.020 --> 09:05.700
In Halo 3 it's coming out on the Xbox 360.

09:05.700 --> 09:07.460
Whoa, shocker.

09:07.460 --> 09:09.620
Okay, seriously.

09:09.620 --> 09:13.700
Alright look, it was making the rounds on game sites so we have to report it.

09:13.700 --> 09:18.700
Alright, do you have something else then, Loki, that might be more worthy of our time?

09:18.700 --> 09:19.700
Maybe?

09:19.700 --> 09:26.820
No, actually, yeah, Sega is developing a Playstation 3 launch title, and what would you think?

09:26.820 --> 09:27.820
And you know what?

09:27.820 --> 09:30.780
The sun's gonna set tomorrow, duh!

09:30.780 --> 09:31.780
No it's not.

09:31.780 --> 09:32.780
Yeah, but how many-

09:32.780 --> 09:33.780
I plan on shooting it down out of the sky.

09:33.780 --> 09:35.940
How many golf games does Sega make?

09:35.940 --> 09:36.940
Oh!

09:36.940 --> 09:37.940
Oh, snap!

09:37.940 --> 09:38.940
Oh my god, sorry.

09:38.940 --> 09:39.940
They don't make mocap.

09:39.940 --> 09:43.460
And plus it is- you know what, I don't care how long it's been, it is still weird to hear

09:43.460 --> 09:48.420
of Sega making games for other consoles? I don't care how long it is, it's still weird.

09:48.420 --> 09:54.380
Yes, they're currently developing a crazy money golf game, and actually it's two golf

09:54.380 --> 10:02.980
games, I should say. Doesn't sound that exciting to me, but I don't know, maybe it's Sonic

10:02.980 --> 10:12.420
Golf or something? I'm sorry, just like everything attached to Sega is just always Sonic? Yeah!

10:12.420 --> 10:15.180
Maybe Ooh La La's Sexy Golf would be awesome.

10:15.180 --> 10:18.740
Or Crazy Taxi Golf.

10:18.740 --> 10:20.780
Let's make some crazy porn!

10:20.780 --> 10:25.820
Alright, DarkSakura is going to try and bring us back to Sanity World.

10:25.820 --> 10:26.820
Oh, who am I kidding?

10:26.820 --> 10:29.500
It's her website of the week and you know it's going to be just as crazy as the rest

10:29.500 --> 10:31.500
of what we've been talking about this evening?

10:31.500 --> 10:36.620
No, it's a serious and important, relevant site that affects everybody's life.

10:36.620 --> 10:38.540
Alright, cue the theme music?

10:38.540 --> 10:39.540
Yes.

10:39.540 --> 10:52.600
Today's website of the week is www.cheese.com Yes, the number one resource about cheese.

10:52.600 --> 10:57.180
To quote from the website, cheese is nutritious food made mostly from the milk of cows but

10:57.180 --> 11:02.980
also other mammals, including sheep, goats, buffalo, reindeer, camels, and yaks.

11:02.980 --> 11:06.700
About 4,000 years ago, people started to breed animals and process their milk.

11:06.700 --> 11:09.140
That's when cheese was born.

11:09.140 --> 11:14.660
You can search the database of 654 cheeses by name, country of origin, type of milk used

11:14.660 --> 11:16.180
to produce it, or by texture.

11:16.180 --> 11:18.420
What about head cheese?

11:18.420 --> 11:23.580
Head cheese is actually the brains of a cow.

11:23.580 --> 11:26.980
I know, but does it have information about that?

11:26.980 --> 11:29.500
I think it's talking about dairy cheese.

11:29.500 --> 11:32.340
No from under cheese then.

11:32.340 --> 11:36.280
From under cheese.

11:36.280 --> 11:43.240
I want red dwarf.

11:43.240 --> 11:48.000
If anybody found Orange Lounge Radio's on topic-ness for this episode, could you please

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
email us?

11:49.000 --> 11:51.180
Because we seem to have lost it.

11:51.180 --> 11:53.000
Some of the cheese is listed on this site.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.800
I believe it's behind the caffeine.

11:54.800 --> 11:56.600
Airedale cheese.

11:56.600 --> 12:01.440
We have American cheese, which is really crap.

12:01.440 --> 12:05.440
Atun cheese, we have Babyville, which actually is one of my favorites.

12:05.440 --> 12:11.840
Basket cheese. We even have things on here like curworthy cheese and curd cheese.

12:11.840 --> 12:15.640
I eat about two blocks of parmesan cheese a month.

12:15.640 --> 12:19.240
You used to do that. How about eating your cheese?

12:19.240 --> 12:22.360
That's a gamer snack, easy cheese. I personally love feta cheese

12:22.360 --> 12:25.480
with sun-dried tomatoes on my pizza. What about Velveeta cheese?

12:25.480 --> 12:29.240
Alright. You know what, that's called processed food cheese product.

12:29.240 --> 12:34.440
All right, so this is your website of the week because it's just because it's cheese

12:36.200 --> 12:41.240
caffeinated cheese. Oh, I think I found the on topic. Here we go.

12:43.160 --> 12:48.520
This new game galactic civilizations to it's actually a little bit different. It just came out

12:48.520 --> 12:52.840
a little different in the digital rights management of the way the game is set up because

12:52.840 --> 12:58.360
the license of the game allows you to install the game onto as many machines as you want to

12:58.360 --> 13:03.280
that you own as long as only one copy is being used at once.

13:03.280 --> 13:06.860
Their thought behind this is how many sales are lost because people want to have a game

13:06.860 --> 13:12.240
on their laptop and desktop, but they don't want to have to buy multiple CDs for that.

13:12.240 --> 13:15.600
Being a laptop and desktop owner, I kind of like games like Warcraft that I can put on

13:15.600 --> 13:19.520
both of them, so that's kind of interesting.

13:19.520 --> 13:26.060
The other side of that is this company called Star Force, which is an anti-piracy developer.

13:26.060 --> 13:30.960
They kind of struck a low blow, a story here on oneup.com that was run earlier this week

13:30.960 --> 13:35.320
saying that Star Force, what they did, they actually posted on their company message boards,

13:35.320 --> 13:41.700
again Star Force makes the anti-piracy software, by an admin and they put a link in the post

13:41.700 --> 13:45.580
to a torrent file for Galactic Civilizations 2.

13:45.580 --> 13:48.800
Why would an anti-piracy company be linking torrents?

13:48.800 --> 13:52.780
Well saying in the post, right now several thousands of people are downloading the pirated

13:52.780 --> 13:54.860
version only from that website.

13:54.860 --> 13:56.140
Is it good for the sales?

13:56.140 --> 13:57.140
Unlikely.

13:57.140 --> 14:00.800
So in other words, it was kind of like a bully tactic in a way because they're an anti-piracy

14:00.800 --> 14:05.160
company and they're saying that, oh, this company didn't use our software and here's

14:05.160 --> 14:07.160
their game being rampantly pirated and how dare they...

14:07.160 --> 14:08.160
Would they sue them?

14:08.160 --> 14:09.600
I don't know what could happen.

14:09.600 --> 14:12.760
Of course, the post is gone now.

14:12.760 --> 14:17.300
And Galactic Civilizations 2 did publish a response saying, our primary weapon to fight

14:17.300 --> 14:22.440
piracy is through rewarding customers through convenient, frequent, free updates.

14:22.440 --> 14:27.240
If you make it easy for users to buy and make full use of your product or service legitimately,

14:27.240 --> 14:32.000
then we believe youíll gain more users from that convenience than youíll lose from piracy.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.080
Very interesting and rebellious stance from this company that I think is very customer

14:36.080 --> 14:37.080
driven.

14:37.080 --> 14:39.080
I got to say, kind of neat.

14:39.080 --> 14:43.000
Like Star Force needed any more negative publicity, seriously.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
What else have they done?

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
Iím not very familiar with that company.

14:45.000 --> 14:50.360
Theyíre really bad, as far as the techs that they use, I think theyíre one of the companies

14:50.360 --> 14:58.320
that had spyware thrown on your PC that basically monitors what you're running, that type of

14:58.320 --> 14:59.320
thing.

14:59.320 --> 15:01.600
I'm pretty sure that was the same company.

15:01.600 --> 15:02.600
Interesting.

15:02.600 --> 15:08.720
So, they're on the naughty list this week, and we've got Galactic Civilizations 2 on

15:08.720 --> 15:12.800
the nice list for their outside the box thinking on their policy there.

15:12.800 --> 15:15.760
Loki, what else is being developed?

15:15.760 --> 15:20.680
company called Bigfoot Networks is actually just gotten some money to

15:20.680 --> 15:28.300
develop what they're saying is going to be the end of all lag lag is gone

15:28.300 --> 15:32.560
they're developing I guess hardware that's gonna be used in conjunction with

15:32.560 --> 15:39.880
online games or god knows what and it will end lag and apparently I don't know

15:39.880 --> 15:44.240
it sounds interesting it's one of those I'll believe it when I see it type

15:44.240 --> 15:48.920
things I definitely hooray for the idea that somebody's gonna try and you know

15:48.920 --> 15:56.040
fix the lag problems but can you really know I don't know I'll believe it when I

15:56.040 --> 16:00.960
see it just like you know of course who knew that you could compress something

16:00.960 --> 16:04.640
like the music into the size of an mp3 file until somebody actually did it

16:04.640 --> 16:08.280
that's probably a horrible comparison but I'm just saying is that you know

16:08.280 --> 16:11.920
sometimes things sound too good to be true and then they really do happen it's

16:11.920 --> 16:15.200
It's basically this product that they're releasing called the NetBlazer card.

16:15.200 --> 16:19.160
It's, I guess, going to go on your PC, so... interesting.

16:19.160 --> 16:22.280
I don't know, it's... sounds cool.

16:22.280 --> 16:26.000
I hope it works. Alright. Dark Sakura!

16:26.000 --> 16:29.680
What? Whoa!

16:29.680 --> 16:34.560
Sorry, Miss Thing. You have some updates, well not updates, but an interesting

16:34.560 --> 16:38.800
story on some games that were never released but maybe should have been?

16:38.800 --> 16:43.800
To quote this title, which I think is perfect, cut down in their prime.

16:43.800 --> 16:44.800
What website is this?

16:44.800 --> 16:47.800
The best games that never were, from a game cloud.

16:49.800 --> 16:52.800
Here's just a list of various games that have been cancelled.

16:52.800 --> 16:56.800
One was Babylon 5 into the fire, cancelled September 1998,

16:56.800 --> 17:00.800
which was basically a big space simulator.

17:00.800 --> 17:04.800
It would have used some film content from the TV actors,

17:04.800 --> 17:07.920
But it was just dragging along for the development so they axed it

17:09.880 --> 17:11.880
There was xcom

17:12.000 --> 17:14.240
Genesis it says I cancelled December

17:14.640 --> 17:19.940
1999 I wonder whatever happened to xcom like I played like one or two of them and then it kind of disappeared

17:19.940 --> 17:23.040
I was never like super into xcom like some of my friends were but you know

17:23.040 --> 17:25.040
I kind of always wondered why there's a

17:25.360 --> 17:31.360
Franchise I'm kind of surprised you haven't seen tried to come back from the dead recently. We have house where to blame for that. Hmm

17:31.360 --> 17:41.860
Next up, XCOM Alliance, cancelled sometime in 2001, again another victim of Hasbro.

17:41.860 --> 17:45.540
Daikatana 2, 1999.

17:45.540 --> 17:47.300
Games that should have been cut.

17:47.300 --> 17:50.680
Amen, The Awakening, January 2000.

17:50.680 --> 17:55.840
It was a first person shooter at Cave Dog.

17:55.840 --> 18:02.060
There was an E3 demo at 1999, had a lot of interactive features, but they, well, had

18:02.060 --> 18:04.500
many issues and boop, down it went.

18:04.500 --> 18:08.680
So they focused on total annihilation and then closed down.

18:08.680 --> 18:17.120
Ultima Worlds Online, I almost said offline, Ultima Worlds Online cancelled March 2001.

18:17.120 --> 18:23.800
It was by Origin and EA to create a sequel to the first Ultima to do sort of like a sci-fi

18:23.800 --> 18:29.800
fantasy thing but it just they didn't want to pull people off of the original

18:29.800 --> 18:33.160
Ultima online so they... Interesting because then years later of course you

18:33.160 --> 18:37.680
have EverQuest 2 doing battle with EverQuest 1 in a way because people who

18:37.680 --> 18:40.760
built up their characters on EverQuest 1 didn't want to leave so it's kind of

18:40.760 --> 18:45.440
like they saw this with Ultima years ago so it's kind of interesting. Another game

18:45.440 --> 18:53.600
canceled with Simsville September 2001. Maxis announced it in 2000 as a mix of

18:53.600 --> 18:57.100
of The Sims and SimCity, um...

18:57.100 --> 18:59.680
but, um...

18:59.680 --> 19:01.520
I actually have an old

19:01.520 --> 19:05.800
copy of, like, SimCity 3000 that has a, like, promo material for it.

19:05.800 --> 19:10.100
Huh. It was like, wow, this looks like it'd be interesting, but I don't know how the hell they're gonna pull it off.

19:10.100 --> 19:13.020
Dude, Bug, do you remember when we used to play SimAnt?

19:13.020 --> 19:15.400
Yes. That game was the shit. The bright yellow ant.

19:15.400 --> 19:21.380
That game was awesome. But it pretty much, uh, instead of doing that, they did The Sims Online and then went on to Sims 2.

19:21.380 --> 19:24.480
which probably was better or worked out better for him

19:24.480 --> 19:26.080
then we had torn

19:26.080 --> 19:29.840
july two thousand when it was canceled it was from interplays uh... black house

19:29.840 --> 19:32.400
studios that would have used the uh...

19:32.400 --> 19:34.280
lift tech engine

19:34.280 --> 19:35.500
uh... hyped up

19:35.500 --> 19:36.960
cancel down

19:36.960 --> 19:41.200
uh... cuz especially interplay hasn't you know the game in two years

19:41.200 --> 19:45.460
uh... duke nukem endangered species canceled two thousand one

19:45.460 --> 19:46.540
uh...

19:46.540 --> 19:48.960
basically cuz they're working on didn't come forever

19:48.960 --> 19:53.420
Um, but they were still, it was, we're still waiting on hello.

19:54.560 --> 20:01.860
Um, but there was, uh, a, uh, message by the, uh, 3d realms, uh, CEO on the

20:01.860 --> 20:03.260
planet crap message boards.

20:03.260 --> 20:05.040
That's the best name ever planet crap.

20:05.980 --> 20:08.640
This was a game we had to give our publisher in order to get a

20:08.640 --> 20:10.500
very sweet deal in another areas.

20:11.100 --> 20:12.300
We've since talked to them.

20:12.600 --> 20:13.780
We've since taught them out of it.

20:13.780 --> 20:19.900
To answer some questions from chatroom, www.orangelanitrader.com.

20:19.900 --> 20:23.740
Phoenix wants to know why are we talking about games that were cancelled in 2000-2001?

20:23.740 --> 20:27.940
Because the list is the best of all time, or best games that were never, I don't know,

20:27.940 --> 20:28.940
all time.

20:28.940 --> 20:29.940
And there's more.

20:29.940 --> 20:30.940
Give us real quickly what's left.

20:30.940 --> 20:37.900
Sam & Max Freelance Police cancelled March 2004, Trinity in 2003, it was sort of a response

20:37.900 --> 20:40.300
Sir, Return of Castle Wolfenstein,

20:40.300 --> 20:42.840
SWAT Urban Justice, canceled 2003,

20:42.840 --> 20:45.260
Mythica, February 2004,

20:45.260 --> 20:47.360
Ultimate X Odyssey, 2004,

20:47.360 --> 20:49.600
Black Nine, sometime in 2003.

20:50.780 --> 20:52.440
Interesting feedback from our chat room.

20:52.440 --> 20:53.660
I think they were starting to shout out

20:53.660 --> 20:55.040
some other games that came to mind.

20:55.040 --> 20:58.020
Ryoma says, the Zelda demo with Ganon.

20:58.020 --> 21:00.760
It was, I guess, a while back there was that demo,

21:00.760 --> 21:03.660
you know, the old, was it on GameCube?

21:03.660 --> 21:05.680
That first demo that they had?

21:05.680 --> 21:07.080
I'm trying to remember which one he's referencing

21:07.080 --> 21:08.700
because there's a couple that come to mind there.

21:08.700 --> 21:11.440
SpiritSnare says they canceled Nintendo puzzle collection,

21:11.440 --> 21:12.820
Panel de Pon forever,

21:12.820 --> 21:15.760
but they released Pokemon Channel instead.

21:15.760 --> 21:17.340
Interesting.

21:17.340 --> 21:20.620
Oh, and Ryoma and GK128 are joining in,

21:20.620 --> 21:24.020
and Earthbound 64, but GK128 pointing out

21:24.020 --> 21:25.740
Earthbound 64 was canned,

21:25.740 --> 21:28.620
but it came back on the GBA in Japan.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.400
And of course, one that I can interject as well,

21:30.400 --> 21:34.020
remember the Final Fantasy VI in 3D demo?

21:34.020 --> 21:36.540
A very brief demo that was on Nintendo 64 or something,

21:36.540 --> 21:39.340
Iíve actually still been trying to hunt that down.

21:39.340 --> 21:46.260
I saw it ages ago, an emulation site had that.

21:46.260 --> 21:49.920
This was another game I was actually interested in, it was Robotech Crystal Dreams.

21:49.920 --> 21:56.740
The developer of that game actually has the ROM for it up on his website and his 3D models

21:56.740 --> 21:57.740
available.

21:57.740 --> 22:03.100
Iíll see if I can hunt that down for folks in the chat room.

22:03.100 --> 22:06.440
One thing that people have been waiting a little while to see a game made out of this

22:06.440 --> 22:08.980
is Family Guy.

22:08.980 --> 22:14.160
That's right, a high voltage software is going to be developing a Family Guy game for Take

22:14.160 --> 22:16.060
Two Entertainment.

22:16.060 --> 22:20.520
They're going to be doing some video games there based on Family Guy, and I'm assuming

22:20.520 --> 22:22.920
that it's actually going to be multi-platform.

22:22.920 --> 22:26.580
I think I read somewhere here it's multi-platform, so you're probably going to see, I would say

22:26.580 --> 22:30.980
it's probably going to be a very similar deal to what you see with the Simpsons games, but

22:30.980 --> 22:36.520
Hopefully better games than what we got with the Simpsons games because they're only a couple like hit and run was okay

22:36.520 --> 22:37.580
But you know

22:37.580 --> 22:42.460
Most of the Simpsons games were kind of poopy the good old arcade game. Oh, well, yeah the arcade game

22:42.460 --> 22:45.640
It owns everything but you know, all right

22:46.260 --> 22:50.540
So what do you think what what family guy game because I know you're a huge family guy fan Loki

22:50.540 --> 22:55.060
What kind of game would you like to see them do besides do he takes over the universe personally?

22:55.060 --> 22:59.980
I think it would be great any family guy game because family guy at least unlike the Simpsons

22:59.980 --> 23:05.860
they're willing to be violent and you know push the boundaries so I think it

23:05.860 --> 23:10.100
would be if you made like a I don't know I personally want to see another arcade

23:10.100 --> 23:16.140
game is like is this family guy jumping the shark though I think it's I wouldn't

23:16.140 --> 23:19.900
really want my you know I wouldn't really want to see a family guy game

23:19.900 --> 23:24.780
just because I'm afraid of what they do with it but if it's done right then hell

23:24.780 --> 23:27.740
yeah ryoma set in our chat room in orange on

23:27.740 --> 23:33.820
It's going to be Peter Farting, Stewie Cursing, Brian Drinking, Chris Whining, Meg Also Whining,

23:33.820 --> 23:37.400
Lois Cleaning Up After Everyone's Crap, and Quagmire Being Generally Horny.

23:37.400 --> 23:39.680
So it'll just be the show.

23:39.680 --> 23:41.580
There should be a Quagmire game.

23:41.580 --> 23:46.220
And Xander C. says, you know what they need to make a video game out of?

23:46.220 --> 23:47.220
Orange Lounge Radio.

23:47.220 --> 23:51.320
Didn't we have somebody a while back that was going to make a text adventure game based

23:51.320 --> 23:52.780
on Orange Lounge Radio or something?

23:52.780 --> 23:55.540
We need our own RPG.

23:55.540 --> 23:59.100
We need to fire up RPG Creator and make something, it'll be interesting.

23:59.100 --> 24:00.100
It's harder than it sounds.

24:00.100 --> 24:01.100
I know.

24:01.100 --> 24:05.380
Hey, you know what guys, if you want to do something like that and get our eternal worship,

24:05.380 --> 24:06.380
go for it.

24:06.380 --> 24:09.820
We'll put it on our MySpace or something, who knows.

24:09.820 --> 24:15.380
Alright, moving on to another story, let's go on over to Loki, who has another possible

24:15.380 --> 24:21.660
movie jumping to the game world.

24:21.660 --> 24:27.300
Well, you know, Quentin Tarantino in video games, that's something you don't really

24:27.300 --> 24:28.300
hear that often.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.980
Please say Kill Bill The Game.

24:29.980 --> 24:30.980
No.

24:30.980 --> 24:31.980
Damn.

24:31.980 --> 24:32.980
Kill Bill The Game.

24:32.980 --> 24:37.580
No, the theme of this year's games coming out are old, classic, violent movies made

24:37.580 --> 24:38.580
into games.

24:38.580 --> 24:43.100
Like you have The Godfather, Scarface, and now Reservoir Dogs.

24:43.100 --> 24:44.100
Yes.

24:44.100 --> 24:45.100
Reservoir Dogs The Game.

24:45.100 --> 24:47.540
Reservoir Dogs The Game.

24:47.540 --> 24:51.060
So lots of cursing, shooting, and black and white.

24:51.060 --> 24:56.860
It's going to be based on the movie and it's being developed by Blitz Games.

24:56.860 --> 25:01.580
It's going to be primarily a third-person shooter, but we'll incorporate some driving

25:01.580 --> 25:12.380
elements as well as the torture scene where Michael Madsen reprises his role of Mr. Blonde

25:12.380 --> 25:16.680
in third-person shooter involving some driving.

25:16.680 --> 25:18.480
Why does Nark come to mind for some crazy reason?

25:18.480 --> 25:19.480
You know what comes to mind for me?

25:19.480 --> 25:20.480
What?

25:20.480 --> 25:21.480
Enter the Matrix.

25:21.480 --> 25:22.680
Oh, that's kind of weird.

25:22.680 --> 25:25.800
Because it involves driving and shooting and general suckage.

25:25.800 --> 25:27.600
I like to enter the Matrix.

25:27.600 --> 25:29.880
Again, is this jumping the shark?

25:29.880 --> 25:30.960
Probably.

25:30.960 --> 25:31.960
It's just a trend.

25:31.960 --> 25:33.600
I mean, it's just like Scarface.

25:33.600 --> 25:34.600
Into the shark.

25:34.600 --> 25:35.600
So.

25:35.600 --> 25:36.600
I would much...

25:36.600 --> 25:37.600
Just like Jaws!

25:37.600 --> 25:40.640
Speaking of jumping the shark, the Jaws game is coming out later this year.

25:40.640 --> 25:44.000
Somebody was just telling me about that game the other night, that they're eagerly awaiting

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
that game.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
Jaws jumped the shark when Jaws 2 came out.

25:46.000 --> 25:51.040
have a jaws 3d with jaws they actually have like a dismemberment engine and

25:51.040 --> 25:53.920
you can dismember people in 25 different places

25:53.920 --> 25:57.120
did you play as the shark you play as the show now that's pretty cool have you

25:57.120 --> 25:57.680
been

25:57.680 --> 26:01.000
I I told you

26:01.000 --> 26:04.880
school well no they showed it at e3 I could have sworn we went looked at I

26:04.880 --> 26:06.840
didn't go look at that cuz I was busy

26:06.840 --> 26:10.200
or in myself out to Sega I like echo the dolphin on rabies

26:10.200 --> 26:17.200
I was in the line for the PS3, that's where I was.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.200
Alright, alright.

26:19.200 --> 26:22.480
Moving on, did you guys hear this?

26:22.480 --> 26:28.820
In China they are rising up and starting a revolution, in World of Warcraft that is.

26:28.820 --> 26:32.360
Game unions have threatened to quit playing World of Warcraft because it has to do with

26:32.360 --> 26:35.600
unstable servers and it's just going crazy.

26:35.600 --> 26:39.240
Now it's important to note that Blizzard really doesn't oversee the servers.

26:39.240 --> 26:44.460
In China, it's actually maintained by a company called The9, and they charge gamers by the

26:44.460 --> 26:49.220
hour to play World of Warcraft.

26:49.220 --> 26:58.960
The9 is having a lot of problems solving technical issues related to the game, and they're not

26:58.960 --> 27:01.380
seeking Blizzard's help all the time there.

27:01.380 --> 27:07.180
Gamers are getting pissed off at severe time delays, long queue times, and frozen server.

27:07.180 --> 27:14.380
Right now, WoW has about 530,000 players on it, and they're about ready to just rise up

27:14.380 --> 27:15.380
and quit playing the game.

27:15.380 --> 27:19.900
They're going to vote with their wallets.

27:19.900 --> 27:25.940
So just so you know, if you thought we had long queues on some of the servers here in

27:25.940 --> 27:30.540
America, just remember, it could always be worse.

27:30.540 --> 27:35.900
DarkSakura traveling around the world there, what's going on in the UK, your UK update?

27:35.900 --> 27:41.840
a few things there is a zombie MMO on its way by thinking man studios cool

27:41.840 --> 27:45.760
it's a survival horror MMORPG that lets you play either as a human or

27:45.760 --> 27:50.660
flesh-eating zombie it's titled ex animus which is a Latin for without life

27:50.660 --> 27:55.600
for people who don't know that is there a button for yelling brains I don't

27:55.600 --> 27:59.420
think a zombie would really have the mental capacity to be able to say brains

27:59.420 --> 28:05.060
they just go like that I just noticed last night that the zombies in Diablo 2

28:05.060 --> 28:11.300
to say brains they do it was creepy well the only speaking zombies we have in like

28:11.300 --> 28:17.420
the Resident Evil universe is just like a stars anyway back to the story and you

28:17.420 --> 28:21.900
should be able to expect to see half rotten corpses walking around tearing

28:21.900 --> 28:27.800
apart the bodies of the living for food and there is a website that's stating it

28:27.800 --> 28:33.100
will be competitively priced to other MMOs currently on the market the game is

28:33.100 --> 28:39.460
only in development for the PC but for a max xbox 360 or ps3 version they say you

28:39.460 --> 28:42.740
never know with technology always changing we are always interested in

28:42.740 --> 28:47.100
finding new outlets for people to play no yet word of a release date and the

28:47.100 --> 28:51.020
screenshots out but there is a site and I'll be linking it to our chat room

28:51.020 --> 28:56.820
shortly I personally want to play as a zombie so I can go around eating people

28:56.820 --> 29:01.420
you know tearing off limbs beating them with one of the dead oh yeah we need

29:01.420 --> 29:07.480
Sean of the Dead the game. That's actually a brilliant idea. Next up Sony is removing

29:07.480 --> 29:14.120
PSP posters. It's a particular poster that advises consumers to take a running

29:14.120 --> 29:18.280
jump from tram and train stations across the country after transport staff

29:18.280 --> 29:24.040
expressed safety concerns. The poster was part of a recent advertising campaign to

29:24.040 --> 29:28.560
promote the PSP in the UK. It featured a plain white background with red text that

29:28.560 --> 29:32.180
said take a running jump from here there's been actually a bunch of other

29:32.180 --> 29:37.320
ones are kind of teasing at the changes that are being made with the PSP like

29:37.320 --> 29:40.080
you know kind of remember the ones we mentioned like well a couple weeks ago

29:40.080 --> 29:46.680
about pictures and stuff interesting hmm well a little bit more on this a rail

29:46.680 --> 29:51.060
worker saw the poster to Tran platform at Metro links Manchester Piccadilly

29:51.060 --> 29:57.260
station and decided there was a safety issue and tried to have it covered they

29:57.260 --> 30:02.260
saw it so it looks inappropriate and to quote on here the message goes

30:02.260 --> 30:05.300
completely against all of our safety messages particularly because

30:05.300 --> 30:08.460
PlayStation is aimed at youngsters and we are constantly telling them not to

30:08.460 --> 30:13.940
trespass so Sony has taken steps down to remove the posters from the tram

30:13.940 --> 30:21.140
stations lastly guess what we've got huh we have release dates which would be

30:21.140 --> 30:28.060
be nice if this battle for middle earth ad wouldn't cover half of them let's see

30:28.060 --> 30:33.940
let's see um we have actually had releases I'm gonna since we have passed

30:33.940 --> 30:37.620
the 10th I'm gonna go ahead and move on to the 14th Metal Gear Solid 3

30:37.620 --> 30:42.420
subsistence on ps2 on the 14th 17th 24 the game

30:42.420 --> 30:49.900
Ankh Atelier Iris eternal mana burnout revenge buzz the big quiz driver

30:49.900 --> 30:55.400
parallel lines, Finding Nemo, Jamesbun007 from Russia with Love, LA Rush, Midway Arcade

30:55.400 --> 31:05.920
Treasures Deluxe, Onimusha, Dawn of Dreams, Sonic Riders, The Outfit, Tom Clancy's Ghost

31:05.920 --> 31:08.760
Recon Advanced Warfighter, Worms.

31:08.760 --> 31:10.200
Sweet.

31:10.200 --> 31:15.360
Loki, anything we should be looking forward to in the US to follow that up?

31:15.360 --> 31:17.740
Yeah, there's actually some pretty cool stuff coming out this week.

31:17.740 --> 31:24.340
parallel lines coming out of Playstation 2 and Xbox. It's supposed to not suck, but we'll

31:24.340 --> 31:31.340
see. Metal Gear Solid 3 Subsistence, of course, really awesome, and if you're into kids games,

31:32.540 --> 31:38.140
I guess, Ice Age 2 the Meltdown. Oh, to match the movie, it's coming out. Well, yeah, the

31:38.140 --> 31:45.140
movie's coming out later this year, but I don't know. Not too much else coming out.

31:45.140 --> 31:50.420
What have you heard about 24 the game? I'm kind of curious about this even though I've fallen behind on watching the actual show just

31:50.420 --> 31:52.740
Because I really haven't watched a lot of TV recently

31:52.740 --> 31:55.940
I mean not even the shows I used to watch like all the time like even like I

31:56.140 --> 32:01.740
I'll admit I watch survivor like every week. I haven't been watching it like nothing. It's it's really weird um

32:02.660 --> 32:08.620
But how's 24 the game supposed to be have you heard anything about this? I know the reviews weren't that great really hmm. That's too bad

32:09.940 --> 32:11.640
This is gonna seem really random

32:11.640 --> 32:16.460
But of course we are an interactive show and sometimes the chat room is going to a dictate the way we go on the show

32:16.460 --> 32:22.260
here a Phoenix in our chat room and orange on twitter.com says this kid at my school got caught wanking in the bathroom to porn on

32:22.260 --> 32:27.640
His PSP in response to the PSP a bit that a dark soccer had to say but that made me think of this clip

32:27.640 --> 32:28.840
That's going around the internet this week

32:28.840 --> 32:34.000
have you guys seen this the guy that's playing World of Warcraft and the friends sneak up on him and he's he's he's

32:34.000 --> 32:39.120
He's wanking to the sexy night elf dancing, the female night elf, have you guys seen this

32:39.120 --> 32:40.120
on YouTube?

32:40.120 --> 32:41.120
No.

32:41.120 --> 32:42.120
Oh god.

32:42.120 --> 32:43.120
No.

32:43.120 --> 32:44.120
Now I sound like I'm crazy.

32:44.120 --> 32:45.800
But hopefully people in chatroom know what I'm talking about here.

32:45.800 --> 32:51.160
But it's kind of like, it looks like it might be fake, I don't know, go to YouTube and search

32:51.160 --> 32:52.160
for it.

32:52.160 --> 32:55.760
I think it might be staged a little bit because it's almost a little too convenient that they

32:55.760 --> 32:59.080
walked in on this guy who had his door open and stuff.

32:59.080 --> 33:02.080
But nevertheless it sure seems to be making the rounds on the internet this week because

33:02.080 --> 33:06.580
I saw it posted in like three different forums. So I don't know that comment made me think of that. Where have you been posting?

33:08.200 --> 33:10.200
World of wank.com

33:13.160 --> 33:15.160
Loki yes

33:16.720 --> 33:20.060
You also have another worldly story for us. Yes, it's

33:21.920 --> 33:23.920
Interesting basically

33:25.560 --> 33:27.300
Nintendo is

33:27.300 --> 33:29.300
Nintendo is going to suit the Dutch

33:29.300 --> 33:33.580
What do they do this time? Everyone's always picking on the Dutch, you know?

33:33.580 --> 33:36.540
Hey, I'm half Dutch. My husband's Dutch, and you know what his

33:36.540 --> 33:40.100
grandfather says? If you ain't Dutch, you ain't much.

33:40.100 --> 33:43.700
Well I know I use a stage name on this show, but if you know my real last name, it's very

33:43.700 --> 33:50.300
Dutch, so you know, you can kind of tell. Basically, long story short, they did a political

33:50.300 --> 33:58.780
ad for when they're, um, one of the politicians running and of course, parodying Mario Brothers,

33:58.780 --> 33:59.780
so.

33:59.780 --> 34:04.100
Wait, so why are the Dutch getting, why are they suing the political party over this?

34:04.100 --> 34:05.100
Because it's the Dutch.

34:05.100 --> 34:08.500
Wait, wait, run this by me again, what happened?

34:08.500 --> 34:14.380
Political party did an advertisement, um, I guess bashing one of their competitors or

34:14.380 --> 34:19.380
whatever, um, running, using like a Mario Brothers type of thing.

34:19.380 --> 34:24.280
Okay, I get it. Do we have a clip or anything? No, it's Dutch. Well, damn.

34:25.040 --> 34:31.640
All right. Well, um, you know, I guess it's nice to know that there's many Su happy companies in the gaming industry. Who knows?

34:32.120 --> 34:34.600
What about parody and all that stuff? Can't you?

34:35.240 --> 34:38.400
Well, I don't know. I guess that's American thing. I don't know about Dutch law,

34:38.400 --> 34:40.840
but shouldn't there be room for fair parody and all that stuff?

34:41.000 --> 34:46.560
No, not when you're talking about Mario Brothers. I guess not, sheesh. Parody and satire. I found it.

34:46.560 --> 34:48.560
Oh, you found the clip?

34:48.560 --> 34:50.560
It's on YouTube.

34:50.560 --> 34:52.560
The World of Warcraft clip or the Dutch clip?

34:52.560 --> 34:54.560
I don't want to watch it right now, but link our chatters.

34:54.560 --> 34:56.560
I will link our chatters.

34:56.560 --> 34:58.560
Alright, let's go over to

34:58.560 --> 35:00.560
God of War 2.

35:00.560 --> 35:02.560
It's coming out.

35:02.560 --> 35:04.560
That's pretty much all we have to say about that at this time.

35:04.560 --> 35:06.560
It is coming out, and

35:06.560 --> 35:08.560
Game Informer Magazine actually has some

35:08.560 --> 35:10.560
screens from it.

35:10.560 --> 35:12.560
Also, something to note, it is coming out for

35:12.560 --> 35:14.560
PlayStation 2.

35:14.560 --> 35:15.760
uh...

35:15.760 --> 35:19.800
not going that's pretty awesome except i haven't got my freaking game former

35:19.800 --> 35:23.400
magazine issues in the last three months

35:23.400 --> 35:26.020
dammit him why would happen

35:26.020 --> 35:26.940
stupid

35:26.940 --> 35:28.240
people

35:28.240 --> 35:31.700
uh... they just don't freaking uh...

35:31.700 --> 35:33.600
they just don't love you and i love me

35:33.600 --> 35:34.700
i guess so

35:34.700 --> 35:38.700
all right well i'm sure that gets you in a pretty angry mood when we get angry we

35:38.700 --> 35:43.480
have to get ranti so that means kids it's time for the f use of the week

35:43.480 --> 35:46.160
Dark Sockra, are you ready to get your hate on?

35:46.160 --> 35:50.920
Yeah, although this Dutch thing is really funny.

35:50.920 --> 35:57.920
Good Dutch rolls.

36:00.340 --> 36:06.280
I'd have to say that my a few of the week goes towards

36:06.280 --> 36:09.520
I would have to say the whole

36:09.520 --> 36:12.500
American work ethic.

36:12.500 --> 36:22.500
As in, well not necessarily the work ethic, but the attitude that corporations, different companies place on overworking employees, you know?

36:22.500 --> 36:29.500
I think it's in the Netherlands that the government has mandatory four weeks paid vacation.

36:29.500 --> 36:34.500
We're here, what are we given, what, ten days, fifteen days, something like that?

36:34.500 --> 36:36.500
And that's including sick time.

36:36.500 --> 36:39.500
Yet, they're just as productive as we are.

36:39.500 --> 36:49.200
So yeah, that's uh, you know, they wonder why we have the highest, uh, you know, amount of, uh, stress leave granted to employees is because THEY'RE BURNING US OUT!

36:50.400 --> 36:51.300
So take a vacation.

36:53.100 --> 36:54.400
Alright, that it?

36:54.700 --> 36:57.000
Yeah, that's been my F.U. of the entire week.

36:57.000 --> 36:57.700
Alright, Loki!

36:58.700 --> 37:07.500
Uh, fuck you to the full auto multiplayer servers and for the people that constantly disconnect mid-race because they're losing and they suck.

37:07.500 --> 37:12.220
It makes it really hard for me to get these last two achievements if people keep quitting

37:12.220 --> 37:14.260
the races and they're not counting.

37:14.260 --> 37:18.200
Get me a 360, I'll help you with that.

37:18.200 --> 37:21.660
I want to give an FU to movie prices, because that's really why I haven't been to the movies

37:21.660 --> 37:22.660
in forever.

37:22.660 --> 37:29.100
Let's see, I can pay $9.25 to go see a movie in the theater, or I can pay less than twice

37:29.100 --> 37:33.180
that to get a Netflix account and watch movies on my pretty HDTV.

37:33.180 --> 37:37.140
Bug, do you have any FUs?

37:37.140 --> 37:44.140
Just a few that are not having a job, still, since May, but I do have an interview this

37:44.140 --> 37:45.140
week.

37:45.140 --> 37:46.140
You want to make your plea?

37:46.140 --> 37:48.420
We have a lot of people listening to this show, maybe some in the Bay Area.

37:48.420 --> 37:49.900
What are your qualifications?

37:49.900 --> 37:50.900
Unix admin.

37:50.900 --> 37:51.900
Alright.

37:51.900 --> 37:54.740
If you want to offer Bug the job, send us an email.

37:54.740 --> 37:55.740
With real money?

37:55.740 --> 37:57.860
He's actually a really smart computer guy.

37:57.860 --> 38:01.740
You know how everybody has that friend that they call when they need their computer fixed?

38:01.740 --> 38:02.740
That's Bug.

38:02.740 --> 38:05.700
I call Bug when Loki's not available.

38:05.700 --> 38:09.880
It really depends on what the issue is, bugged I call for most of my issues.

38:09.880 --> 38:15.420
Also I had one more I forgot, FU did my work for blocking all internet access except for

38:15.420 --> 38:19.760
a few select sites and this is not really, I understand why they're doing it because

38:19.760 --> 38:24.420
there's a lot of people slacking off at work and going on MySpace and stuff like that.

38:24.420 --> 38:30.500
But the problem is also the sites I use for my information on games and stuff and to update

38:30.500 --> 38:35.540
our interoffice forms and stuff is being blocked and I have to constantly email them like for

38:35.540 --> 38:40.400
example, IGN. You don't really understand how many subdomains there are to IGN until

38:40.400 --> 38:44.860
you actually have it blocked and try to have them unblock it. There's like 60 different

38:44.860 --> 38:48.620
domains on there and they have to unblock all of them. And they're arguably saying,

38:48.620 --> 38:53.340
oh, some of these are for ads and we don't want to unlock two ads. Well, then I don't

38:53.340 --> 38:58.460
get pictures on that site and GameSpot, same thing. I don't have pictures on the site anymore

38:58.460 --> 39:03.180
and all the site formatting is all messed up now because they blocked all this stuff.

39:03.180 --> 39:06.900
And also the other thing too, they blocked all search engines, so if you're looking for

39:06.900 --> 39:09.860
information that might not be on those sites, oh, you're screwed.

39:09.860 --> 39:13.420
How about instead of blocking the entire internet, they just block MySpace?

39:13.420 --> 39:16.020
Or maybe they should just block the sites that they don't want people to go to, which

39:16.020 --> 39:21.740
I've insisted they do in the first place, but the conspiracy theory around the office

39:21.740 --> 39:26.940
is they're doing it to make work uncomfortable so people will leave.

39:26.940 --> 39:29.100
Now can you still play solitaire on the computers?

39:29.100 --> 39:30.100
Yeah.

39:30.100 --> 39:32.260
Well, what did they fix then?

39:32.260 --> 39:34.740
make sure you don't play with the government when it comes through what

39:34.740 --> 39:38.320
they did in my work is that there is actually a corporate software that they

39:38.320 --> 39:43.540
can have go in with Internet Explorer that blocks certain sites registered as

39:43.540 --> 39:46.940
a certain type exactly that's what they did in this site but they blocked even

39:46.940 --> 39:51.740
stuff that was registered as movies slash TV which is our business I mean

39:51.740 --> 39:56.660
come on but it's just gotten to ridiculous level they've taken they've

39:56.660 --> 40:02.460
I've taken this whole back-asswards approach to try to solve the problem.

40:02.460 --> 40:04.900
You know how I know that we made it, though, in the business?

40:04.900 --> 40:11.540
OrangeLonsRadio.com finally got blocked by Websense at one point for being an internet

40:11.540 --> 40:12.540
fan club or something.

40:12.540 --> 40:14.940
I can still access it at work.

40:14.940 --> 40:19.500
I know, but I couldn't access it at one of our vendor companies because I guess they

40:19.500 --> 40:24.100
have a high level of restriction on Websense, and we get picked up.

40:24.100 --> 40:25.100
Interesting, huh?

40:25.100 --> 40:26.100
Lucky you.

40:26.100 --> 40:31.520
I know. Well it's excellent though. I can't wait to explain to my boss why certain things

40:31.520 --> 40:36.580
take longer than usual now. You just have to give justification. That's what it's all

40:36.580 --> 40:41.420
about. Once management starts fussing things will change. When it starts affecting how

40:41.420 --> 40:46.380
management looks, oh yeah, they'll make a change. When they can't hit their girly porn,

40:46.380 --> 40:53.380
they'll fix it. Alright, let's move on and get back into some news here. Loki, Konami

40:53.380 --> 40:59.860
what are they up to they're up to making some stuff no they're they're get they're jumping

40:59.860 --> 41:08.020
on the nintendo's bandwagon that's right konami's making another dog simulator game including a

41:08.020 --> 41:15.700
touch mode and stuff the only difference is it's for pc okay well that's different that dog looks

41:15.700 --> 41:22.220
like it's peeing that dog looks fat yes all the pictures of this game look like they all look

41:22.220 --> 41:31.300
like the dog is taking a crap. It's true! What is the game? Pooping Dog? It's Dog Station

41:31.300 --> 41:36.860
is what it is. This looks like a great game for me to poop on. Why can't I make a cat

41:36.860 --> 41:44.980
game? So seriously, it's like dog picture dog pooping. Dog picture dog pooping. I guess

41:44.980 --> 41:50.460
it's the way he's sitting. I don't know. Dog poop is funny. If I remember correctly though,

41:50.460 --> 41:54.780
I believe Dog Station was an arcade game, I want to say, because I know that Dog Station

41:54.780 --> 41:58.660
is a franchise that they have out there right now.

41:58.660 --> 42:02.500
I'm not exactly sure what you do, but Dark Tetsuya in chat agrees with you.

42:02.500 --> 42:04.900
But it's interesting.

42:04.900 --> 42:06.860
So it'd be like Nintendogs at work.

42:06.860 --> 42:09.540
Next you're going to be getting Boonga Boonga, the home version.

42:09.540 --> 42:10.540
Gross.

42:10.540 --> 42:13.660
If you don't know what that is, good.

42:13.660 --> 42:14.660
You're lucky.

42:14.660 --> 42:15.660
Ah, Dark Sakura.

42:15.660 --> 42:16.660
What?

42:16.660 --> 42:21.460
You have an interesting story about a game I've been looking forward to. I don't know

42:21.460 --> 42:22.220
much about it

42:22.220 --> 42:26.460
but it still sounds fascinating to me, just the little I have heard about it.

42:26.460 --> 42:27.340
Why do you need it?

42:27.340 --> 42:31.140
I think I do. I think we could all use a little bit of it.

42:31.140 --> 42:34.780
What is it? Brain training!

42:34.780 --> 42:39.820
Brain training is,

42:39.820 --> 42:44.060
actually there was an announcement in the

42:44.060 --> 42:49.820
Mainichi daily news, which I think is funny because Mainichi also means every day. Anyway, um, it's

42:51.020 --> 42:52.340
basically

42:52.340 --> 42:58.660
To help your brain fire on all of the nerve structures and all doctors are recommending it to the elderly

42:58.820 --> 43:00.820
to help stimulate their brain

43:02.700 --> 43:07.000
There's a memory loss clinic at Kyoto's Uchida hospital

43:07.820 --> 43:09.820
for patients suffering dementia

43:09.820 --> 43:19.480
They got a hold of the DS's and brain training and are using it to try to help people get

43:19.480 --> 43:21.560
brain function back.

43:21.560 --> 43:27.560
There's a quote from a 67 year old patient named Isamu Shishido who said that he hoped

43:27.560 --> 43:30.640
the game would help him stop forgetting things like names and phone numbers so his daughter

43:30.640 --> 43:32.700
will stop making fun of him.

43:32.700 --> 43:35.960
To quote, I don't want to end up some crazy old man, I want to play a little every day

43:35.960 --> 43:37.500
before going to bed.

43:37.500 --> 43:42.220
He said, this isn't even reasonable stuff, Nintendo basically though is using this as

43:42.220 --> 43:46.940
an excuse to point out again that people of all ages like Spring Training Software and

43:46.940 --> 43:56.100
that they're trying to use this strategy to try and appeal to existing games, you know,

43:56.100 --> 44:00.700
gamers who are out of it, non-gamers, trying to basically appeal to the whole broad market

44:00.700 --> 44:03.900
of gamers as this is something you can use to...

44:03.900 --> 44:09.020
I can't help but think myself, is this going to be the next game that really crosses that

44:09.020 --> 44:12.180
gap and gets everybody in on it, like Tetris?

44:12.180 --> 44:16.620
Well the theory is it's actually a publicity stunt because Nintendo is housed in Kyoto.

44:16.620 --> 44:26.440
But you know, if it's going to pretty much help with, you know, because we're first marketing

44:26.440 --> 44:32.140
it to younger people and people of slow learning capacity, but if this is something that's

44:32.140 --> 44:37.860
going to also help keep the minds of older people sharp to hold off some of the effects

44:37.860 --> 44:45.620
of old age, then who are we to tell them not to do it?

44:45.620 --> 44:51.540
If it's actually helping people, if it does good, they should go for it.

44:51.540 --> 44:54.900
Some folks in our chat room might disagree with the brain training setting the stage

44:54.900 --> 44:56.980
to be a huge game.

44:56.980 --> 45:00.380
Funny Dale in our chat room says, brain training, with that name alone, it's a sure bet that

45:00.380 --> 45:05.240
it'll fail in the USA I think it's good I think brain Olympics would have been a

45:05.240 --> 45:08.360
but then you get you fight with the Olympic Committee over something like

45:08.360 --> 45:12.040
that but because people love the only well actually I don't know the Olympics

45:12.040 --> 45:15.680
are pretty poor rated this year on HBO how these have brain games I remember a

45:15.680 --> 45:20.640
Fox special that was on something like how smart is America or the great

45:20.640 --> 45:23.840
American quiz when this couple years ago they had this show on it was like a big

45:23.840 --> 45:26.640
20 question quiz show no control was far better

45:26.640 --> 45:33.240
whatever Colin Quinn just attach the name American Idol to brain training and

45:33.240 --> 45:40.640
as much as pop star pop idol and as opposites that that probably sounds you

45:40.640 --> 45:48.060
know American Idol does well in the ratings all right um let's go for like

45:48.060 --> 45:52.980
brain food all right let's uh we're kind of winding down here with orange lounge

45:52.980 --> 45:57.060
radio this week but first off a chance for anybody to get out any stories they

45:57.060 --> 46:01.760
haven't done yet before we get into tonight's last story I got one okay this

46:01.760 --> 46:07.320
is gonna become well actually it should piss off a lot of people according to a

46:07.320 --> 46:12.420
post on xbox.com there is an internal Best Buy document and we know how

46:12.420 --> 46:17.860
wonderful those are stating that the new premium systems will now include a

46:17.860 --> 46:21.540
a hundred gigabyte hard drive instead of a twenty gigabyte hard drive.

46:21.540 --> 46:23.540
What?

46:23.540 --> 46:25.700
Yeah, my thoughts exactly.

46:25.700 --> 46:31.100
Exactly, bastards. And this is supposed to coincide with the DirecTV

46:31.100 --> 46:33.740
downloadable

46:33.740 --> 46:38.620
thing that's supposed to be... Fucking bastards, I mean...

46:38.620 --> 46:42.020
Because Final Fantasy XI, when that comes out, it's going to eat up all your hard drive

46:42.020 --> 46:47.600
space. You're not going to have room for anything like... Look at it this way, with the

46:47.600 --> 46:51.720
with the Xbox 360 being white, it'll really show where you scraped it right across your

46:51.720 --> 46:54.600
ass because you hate it.

46:54.600 --> 47:02.000
So, I'm taking it as a rumor for now, but I can see this happening.

47:02.000 --> 47:07.000
Alright, uh, last story of the night, Loki, what's the exciting news this week?

47:07.000 --> 47:12.980
If you're a fan of really cheesy crap that's on TV, you might remember a show called Captain

47:12.980 --> 47:16.580
N. I remember how awful that show was.

47:16.580 --> 47:21.940
right the NES era cartoon featuring Kevin Kean normal teenager battling the

47:21.940 --> 47:28.140
evil mother brain in video land it's coming in I remember how awful they

47:28.140 --> 47:32.540
characterized everybody because it was like making me a mega high and made

47:32.540 --> 47:38.660
Simon Belmont into this whole narcissistic glam boy I couldn't I can

47:38.660 --> 47:43.780
see that though it was awful sorry but Simon Belmont looks like launch pad from

47:43.780 --> 47:48.940
from DuckTales. Oh my god he does. The only good thing about that show is when they went

47:48.940 --> 47:55.780
to the whole Zelda universe and they actually got the same voice actors for Link and Zelda.

47:55.780 --> 47:59.580
Oh from the, yeah. And I thought the character models were pretty good. So what's the deal

47:59.580 --> 48:03.140
we can down? It jumped the shark with the Game Boy. What's the deal with Captain N DVD?

48:03.140 --> 48:09.900
Coming to DVD? Oh Jesus when? Don't have a when yet but it is coming to DVD. So to put

48:09.900 --> 48:14.460
next to your Zelda cartoons from the Super Mario Super Show this is also put

48:14.460 --> 48:19.500
out by the same people that did I believe what was it I remember the show

48:19.500 --> 48:27.820
now it was cops the animated series I liked cops which I might add got horrible

48:27.820 --> 48:33.180
reviews and the transfer sounds like was all those busters versus Ghostbusters

48:33.180 --> 48:39.420
but the the whole thing about the captain is it for anybody who ever paid

48:39.420 --> 48:46.460
attention to the actual storylines to the games. It was like a big ol' insult.

48:46.460 --> 48:51.200
I just want to clarify some things in the chatroom there. The statement there coming

48:51.200 --> 48:56.280
from a couple of people, I'll read Sephiroth1215's line here. The HDDs aren't even 20 gigs, it

48:56.280 --> 49:00.140
was like 16. This is because of the emulator that's pre-installed on the drive.

49:00.140 --> 49:05.060
Oh yeah, they forgot to mention that when they're selling you the 20 gig hard drive.

49:05.060 --> 49:09.260
By the way, there's already a big fat emulator on here that you can't really get rid of.

49:09.260 --> 49:15.260
And also, it's pre-loaded with a bunch of songs, too, like I had to go through and delete all the stuff,

49:15.260 --> 49:20.260
because I actually loaded a custom soundtrack on my machine for when I'm playing the little Bejeweleds and Zumas and stuff.

49:20.260 --> 49:24.260
I put a custom soundtrack on there, so I had to delete all the crap that was already on there.

49:24.260 --> 49:25.260
Frustrating.

49:25.260 --> 49:30.260
And I thought the way the Xbox handled the memory management was way better than 360,

49:30.260 --> 49:34.260
because in 360 you have to dive into all the submenus to erase something, it's just very frustrating.

49:34.260 --> 49:38.260
There's no global disk erase menu.

49:38.260 --> 49:41.260
Why would you want to erase anything ever?

49:41.260 --> 49:43.260
I don't know.

49:43.260 --> 49:46.260
Well kids, it's about time to wrap up this edition of Orange Lounge Radio,

49:46.260 --> 49:49.260
but not before we go around and get everybody's final thought.

49:49.260 --> 49:51.260
DarkSakura, your final thought?

49:51.260 --> 49:53.260
Number one, reject false icons.

49:53.260 --> 49:58.260
Number two, the redeeming quality of Captain Inn was the Mother Brain and the Eggplant Wizard.

49:58.260 --> 50:00.260
That's true, the Eggplant Wizard did rock.

50:00.260 --> 50:03.260
Bug, thank you for being here tonight. What's your final thought?

50:05.260 --> 50:06.260
I don't know.

50:06.260 --> 50:11.020
alright Loki your final thought I gotta play some more I actually gotta try

50:11.020 --> 50:16.020
burnout online I hear that's good but I need to get my full auto stuff done

50:16.020 --> 50:21.380
first and my final thought is I'm about to be sucked back into Final Fantasy 11
