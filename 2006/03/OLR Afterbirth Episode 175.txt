Thanks for watching!
We're back with Orange Lounge Radio, the afterbirth, the part of the show where we keep things going here that's too hot for the podcast.
Just, you know, all the personal stuff, stuff about our personal lives.
You know, tonight's show is actually very long, though, so we don't have a whole lot of time, and we do want to do a cage match tonight.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Which makes me very relieved.
The first night there, we went to Waffle House, which Dan wasn't thrilled about.
But I was like, Ash Browns!
So I had Waffle House.
And then the next day, we went to Cracker Barrel, which Dan liked.
And I had fried okra and fried catfish and fried everything else.
And we went to see my ex-roommates, my mama-san and my papa-san, who took care of me during a really difficult time.
And we went to the Atlanta Bread Company for dinner that night, but we weren't before closing, so they weren't all that great.
And then Steak and Shake, where their food is awful.
They have chili on the spaghetti.
Yes, you can get full-on marinara sauce and chili.
on the spaghetti.
It's horrible.
Their fries are awful, but their milkshakes are the best ever.
They do this thing called the side-by-side, which I had a banana and dark chocolate milkshake and mixed them, and it was fabulous.
I did not eat my Blue Bell ice cream, but I did have boiled peanuts.
We also ate at a place called Cooper T's, and it's a very weird thing sharing beer with my brother
He's going to be 22 this month.
Happy birthday, Matt.
I also found out my brother Phillip is on a naval boat.
He's a Marine.
Somewhere in Asia, somewhere.
He's supposed to be going, I think, to Hokkaido, then down to Okinawa, then around the China coast, and then back home.
Doing something or the other, I don't know.
I just told him to bring me back stuff.
and we also went to the Mobile Museum of Art, which was very nice.
There was a lot of local art there too, as well as some very nice classics.
There was even a couple of Renoir there.
Really nice stuff.
We also...
I was actually born in Dothan.
We went to go see my dad and my granny, and they conveniently forgot that I am on a low-carb eating plan and vegetarian, so they had steak and pecan pie.
I ate some steak to make my daddy happy.
It was pretty good, made me very ill, and pecan pie, which was very yummy.
And it was very interesting meeting my dad's new fianc√©e, one of several.
She was nice, though.
I like her.
Maybe they'd be happy.
And we went back.
I had my bowl of peanuts.
We went and ate at Ruby Tuesday's.
The next day, we go to Winslow's Oyster House.
I eat fried oysters, and I'm happy.
My uncle's there, gives us Mardi Gras stuff.
And then we flew home that day.
Very, very horrible plane ride.
I was up in the air for six hours, running into a headwind with massive turbulence.
It was to suck, but I did watch most of Hellboy.
That movie's pretty cool.
And, of course, Dan played lots of Phoenix Wright, and I played lots of Animal Crossing.
I went on a trip.
I went to Virginia.
Did you have a nice fall?
Um, shut up.
Here's a list of things I did for the first time that might make you a little bit proud.
Remember, we're from the West Coast.
We don't have some of this stuff, so it's all new to us.
I ate at a Sonic.
I've never eaten at a Sonic before.
Pretty good.
They have a wide selection of stuff.
There's one in Yuba City.
Yeah, but I still have never eaten there, and that's 40 minutes away for those playing along at home.
There's one that's going in by Arco.
It's not bad, so, you know, check it out.
It's across from the Hooters.
Okay, here's the other thing.
I ate at a Chick-fil-A for the first time.
Thanks for watching!
A.K.A.
Carl's Jr.
Carl's Jr.
is nasty.
No, Carl's Jr.
is way better than Hardee's.
No, I'm saying it's Carl's Jr.
but nasty.
Yeah, you guys on the East Coast, you have it.
Sorry, Carl's Jr.
is way better.
Did you go to Crystal?
Three words, Western Bacon.
No, they didn't have that there.
Or at least I didn't find it.
Let's see, what else did I do in Virginia?
I went to an aquarium there.
Let me just put it this way.
The coolest thing at the aquarium was the birdcage.
You go figure that one out.
And I went to the beach.
That was the first time I'd really been to the East Coast Beach.
No, I did it a second time because I went to Fire Island years ago.
No, just a couple of years ago I went to Fire Island very randomly.
Get your mind out of the gutter.
We just walked around the beach, if you know what that is.
And if you know what that is, hats off to you.
I guess, let's see, what else did I do in Virginia?
Not a lot.
I camped out in the hotel most of the time.
I ate and ate a lot of food.
I gained about five pounds on my trip, so I'm not proud of that.
But I'll be working it off pretty soon.
That's pretty much it.
That's all I really want to share.
It was cold.
You know what?
For the first time in my life,
We found a DJ.
I quit Final Fantasy XI, and that was pretty tough.
What happened to the shell?
Are you able to pass that off to somebody else?
No.
So they better be careful who they add, because they can't delete anybody, and they can't create new... They'll just create another shell, I don't care, whatever.
Um, and then, I played a lot of Full Auto.
I didn't play any Animal Crossing, and I'm tired of that game already.
And, um, I don't know, it's been pretty much just a lot of getting last minute wedding stuff done, starting to send out the invitations, and I was figuring out the last bit of stuff, got the cake flavors picked out.
And I'm supposed to be getting a bachelor party sometime in early April.
Mainly I'm just work stuff, trying to catch up, trying to win my VIP pass to E3.
I don't know if I am, seeing as I'm 30 accounts behind someone else.
Because, well, I just haven't had good luck with my territory.
It's rigged.
Yes, it is rigged.
I am pretty certain that it is rigged.
But I'm going to beg them for a VIP pass anyways because I deserve it.
Whereas the other guy doesn't know what the hell he would do with it.
So I should be able to get one.
I mean, fuck.
Some of my managers are getting them and they don't play games.
They don't even know anything about games.
So hopefully I'll be able to swing that.
Otherwise we've got to get a media pass.
Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition needs to be harder.
But isn't it hot, though?
Oh, yeah.
No, it's awesome.
That's hot.
That game is hot, but yeah.
I thought it had a harder difficulty in that.
It's the same as the old hard difficulty, just renamed Super Hard, and then there's a new Super Easy mode.
Well, why don't you play through it?
That's kind of weird.
They need to name them and do them according to the Doom model.
Hurt Me Plenty, Nightmare, you know, and make them equally hard.
You know what I was so sad is when they announced that whole Rockstar Table Tennis thing, the whole tease of it was...
No, we've got news of a game that's coming to the 360 that you would never expect to hear.
And I was like, Duke Nukem Forever.
Duke Nukem Forever.
Come on!
It's gonna be Duke Nukem Forever!
No.
Alright.
Anything else?
Not really, my whole life is video games.
It's sad.
No, that's awesome.
You're hardcore.
That's why you're the guest tonight.
Because we know you're hardcore.
We feel, we see it in your soul.
Alright, um... That's right, rock.
Anyway, let's get to the cage match.
I know, I don't know
So anyway, the way the cage match works is that we're going to play three songs for you guys.
You guys pick your favorite, and it goes into rotation all week long on Orange Moms Radio's video game and other music programs.
www.orangemomsradio.com, click on chat, be in the chat room, vote, play along.
Three songs, here we go.
Loki, what's the first song we're going to hear tonight?
You won your first.
Um, I honestly don't remember.
Here's a hint.
Distorted reality with Super Crush.
Oh yeah, this is a song that I found on Amazon because the original song I was looking for, I couldn't find a website that I could pirate it from.
So, this is, uh, yeah.
I don't even know what this sounds like.
So, it's another random song that I picked out of the middle of nowhere.
Goody Goody Gumdrops.
Hey, it worked last time.
So, will the magic work again of randomness?
Song number one from Loki tonight, distorted reality with Super Crush.
Enjoy.
Thank you for watching!
Thank you for watching!
When you search for truth you'll find Nothing but your empty mind I will die for you someday With the way I'm afraid
You bow, crow,
Yo, that was song number one tonight, Distorted Reality with Super Crush.
Let's see what the folks in the studio thought of it, but remember, it's not up to us, it's up to you.
DarkSakura.
It was cool.
It was cool, just a little repetitive, but it gets a 7.5.
Generic goth club song for me, 6.
Loki, gets an 8, because, yeah, I don't know why.
I've first ever heard it, so, yeah.
All right.
Let's move on to song number two tonight, which comes to us from DarkSakura.
What did you pick for us tonight?
It was the Afterbirth.
However, last time, however, so many people said that it should have been my Gage Match song that I put it in the Gage Match today.
So it's Compressor and Empty Frontalot.
And what's the name of this song?
It's Rappers We Crush.
Yep.
All right, here it is, Rappers We Crush by Compressor featuring Empty Frontalot.
Enjoy.
All right, I'm a freak.
The Wheel of the Lead Traveller visits your fear.
Red and yellow eyes, black gloves gripping the steer.
Thanks for watching!
What did I do to deserve this?
What was my crime?
Was it because I sampled the Totem Hose in that one time?
And I'm reviewing my life, cowered under a grease trap The boot flap, steppin' ever closer with this click clap Now he's here, now he's crouching down, jaws creak, open hips start pouring out And just as my flesh is about to get devoured, I wake up screaming Wrapped in the sour sweat, stained sheets, takes a minute to get up Stumble to the table, read the paper, clear my head up
Caption AM, take me by Jim Henson
Song number two tonight, Compressor, featuring MC Frontalot with Rappers We Crush.
What do you think about that song?
Is it great, or do you just want to crush it with your fists?
DarkSakura.
Nine.
Any reason?
I was actually saying no in German.
Oh, gotcha.
The number nine, too.
Okay.
I would have to say, you know, I think I liked it better last time I heard it, but it's got clever lyrics, which I like about it, because they rap about, like, Muppets, and that's pretty hardcore.
So I'm going to give it... I definitely want to give it higher than the last one, but not by much.
So seven.
Loki.
That's going to get a six.
I don't care for MC Frontalot at all.
All right.
Let's get into song number three tonight.
Song number three is my pick, and I love this band.
They were in Ultramix 3, and they have a remix album coming out soon.
It's the Azoic, and this song is called Going Under.
It's a kinetic mix.
Enjoy.
Enjoy.
Song number three tonight, the Ezoic going under Kinetic Mix.
Let's see what the kids thought of that one.
DarkSakura.
Um, better than your usual picks.
Aw, how sweet.
I mean, seriously.
I mean, it sounded less generic, so I guess an eight.
All right.
Uh, moving on.
Loki, what'd you think of the Ezoic going under Kinetic Mix?
Kind of average.
Seven.
All right.
I like that mix, but I think I like the original one slightly better, so it gets an 8 from me.
Alright, place vote now.
Here it is, three songs you can pick from tonight.
Distorted Reality with Super Crush.
And song number two you can vote for tonight, Compressor featuring MC Frontalot, Rappers We Crush.
And song number three you can vote for tonight, The Ezoic with Going Under, The Kinetic Mix.
Place a vote now.
Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
You don't have much time, so frickin' hurry up.
Frickin' hurry with it.
Okay, now that we're in the afterbirth, now I suppose we can talk about the Oscars a little bit.
Meek Latav, I see you lurking back there.
Want to come on the show for a little bit?
You just want your iPod?
I see how you are.
Yeah, I'll make you work for it.
Come here.
Where's the microphone?
There it is on the ground there.
Are you mad about the Oscars?
Because I heard that Crash won and not Brokeback Mountain.
I can't be mad about the Oscars because they were obviously just the joke Oscars since that pimp song won Best Song.
Did it really?
Yeah.
Have you seen Hustle and Flow, though?
It is actually supposed to be pretty good.
Granted, I don't watch those type of movies, but it is supposed to be...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I fell out of love with the Oscars years ago
and, please don't get me wrong, Crash was a really good movie, and Brokeback Mountain was a really good movie, but, you know what, there were thousands, you know, I'm sure there were lots of, maybe not thousands, but there were lots of good movies this year, and who's to say... Saw 2 should have won.
Saw 2 totally should have won.
Saw 2 was amazing.
Fuck.
Who won the Razzies?
Now, those... Was it crazy?
Those are... It was, it was pretty... Saw 2.
Saw 2 was pretty good, actually.
We didn't even look to see who won a Razzie.
We didn't even look to see... Yeah, he did.
He did.
Yeah, I think he won it for Blood Rain.
I'm sure he did.
Well...
I really didn't care about the Oscars this year because I figured Brokeback would probably lose even though it deserved to win out of what was there.
And so it's like, whatever.
The pimps won.
The racists won.
It's fine.
How was Jon Stewart as host?
I heard he made an appearance or something
A commercial saying how this audio engineer doesn't deserve to win, but this audio engineer does.
Like a political commercial.
It's pretty funny.
But most of the time, I actually didn't watch the Oscars.
I flipped to it to see a couple of the awards that I mostly watched.
Weren't you guys watching a Law & Order marathon?
If I was in the living room right now, I'd still be watching Law & Order.
Unfortunately for you guys, I don't think Uevo won.
The winner for Worst Picture is Dirty Love.
Worst Actor goes to Rob Schneider.
Worst Actress would be Jenny McCarthy, also in Dirty Love.
She's awesome, though.
Worst Supporting Actor, Hayden Christensen in Star Wars Episode III.
Worst Supporting Actress, Paris Hilton in House of Wax.
And they spell wax wrong, that's funny.
And then Worst On-Screen Couple, Will Ferrell, Nicole Kidman in Bewitched.
Worst Sequel or Remake, Son of the Mask.
and Worst Website, the Razzie Awards.
Imagine that.
Look at that crap website.
It looks like it was made in Angel Fire.
Here, plug, I know you can't talk about anything that goes on at Konami because of NDAs and stuff, but plug your favorite board game.
Oh!
Apples to Apples is the best war game.
It has actually taken over break time at work.
Mario Kart is no longer the reigning champion.
We play Apples to Apples because it's really, really fun.
That was quite fun.
Really quickly, what do you do in Apples to Apples?
You judge people.
That's pretty much what you do.
There's this judge and he puts down an adjective card and then everybody else looks at the cards in their hands and they're all nouns and then they place what they think
The judge thinks would be the best match.
And then the judge picks up all the cards, looks at them, and then he awards a point to what he thinks is the best.
But the main part of the game is saying why you don't think certain cards should win.
And if you're you, who likes to judge everybody.
Yeah, pretty much.
That's why it's fun.
All right.
Let's announce the winner of tonight's cage match so we can wrap this show up here.
You guys ready?
This is a very, very close cage match tonight, might I say.
One of the closer ones in years because one vote separated the winner from the runner-up and then one vote separated the runner-up from third place.
So all three songs were very neck and neck.
But in the end, there can be only one.
And tonight's winner is...
I won stinking vote over Compressor.
Two stinking votes over... Just like the Oscars, the one that's most fresh in the minds of the voters is the one that won.
I bought all those votes, but I actually placed an ad in Variety this week.
For your consideration, the Ezoic going under Kinetic.
Best supporting song on an internet radio station.
Lovely.
It's time to wrap up.
Now I'm getting tired.
I'm worn out.
You haven't done chatroom FUs.
Oh, that's right.
Oh, okay.
I will solicit.
I will allow chatroom FUs.
One each.
Yeah, one each.
We'll take the first five.
That's right.
So hurry up.
Send a private message to Sky with your chatroom FUs and we'll hook that up.
What can we talk about in the meantime?
What else is going on?
I don't know.
Taxes.
I'm getting money.
That's how I managed to buy the iBook.
$1,200 from federal and $200 from state.
Nice.
I actually started having them withhold a lot of money.
I turned on the cabinet this weekend and then turned it back off because I got yelled at for turning on the cabinet while people were in the house and distracting the guests and not socializing with people.
I know.
I just sent Dan out to the garage to play the meme.
We have ours built out of a stand-up composition.
I feel so uncool.
I'm the only OLR host with no main cabinets.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
That's stupid.
Have you seen the little ones at Target, though?
The little baby ones?
No.
They're interesting.
I mean, they're still a little pricey for me.
I don't think I'd have one, but, you know.
I want to make more of my interfaces, but I just don't have them in the store.
I need to get into a new apartment or a new condo or whatever so that we have our own bedroom dedicated to the cabinet so I can dump them in the closet because, unfortunately, each interface is like six feet wide or, no, four feet wide and
It's just too big.
You know what I want?
Because we had Bobby on the show tonight from All Games, and he was talking about on another show about how he went to Media Play, because you know all the Media Play stores went under?
And he freaking got one of those PlayStation 2 kiosks that you have in the store.
Yeah, he got one of those in his house.
We have an Xbox One.
Really?
God!
Those are about two grand.
They're pretty expensive.
Oh my god, really?
Yeah, because I've actually... I can tell you that's probably not what he paid for it.
I have a thing for Microsoft because they were pimping out their... The kiosk before the 360 was coming out.
And they were like five grand for those.
They have really detailed ones.
Bob, he's going to link a picture right now so you guys can see it in his house.
I think he said he was playing Guitar Hero on it or something.
I don't remember.
Well, that's another thing.
I've got to set up Guitar Freaks on mine eventually.
And now that they've got actual DDR games running under MAME, that should be pretty cool.
What else was... There was something else I was going to try.
That was pretty cool.
Oh, he went ahead and told us how much he paid.
He paid $500 for it.
Yeah, that's pretty good.
Wow, that's hardcore, though.
I don't know if I could have spent that kind of money, but you go, boy.
That's awesome.
Here it is.
Here's a picture.
Hold on, I'm loading it up right there.
There it is.
Oh, and it's Guitar Hero.
Right on there.
That's pretty cool.
He's got the little eye toy set up there on the top, a little cutout there.
That's awesome.
Just sitting in the apartment, just chilling.
You know you're into games when... Someday, my cabinet will be done.
Someday.
I've got all the parts.
I just need the time and the space to put it in.
Someday, it will be mine.
Seriously, it's been, like, what, in production for two years now?
Yeah.
Well, the big... Since I lived with you in that apartment.
A brief vacation, though, of course.
All right.
Let's get to chatroom FUs.
All right, you ready for this, DarkSakura?
Sure.
Um, let's see.
MiniMe283 says, F you to the Oscars for not nominating Cinderella Man or Narnia enough.
I like Narnia.
I thought it was much better than I thought it would be.
Cinderella Man I didn't see.
I don't like Russell Crowe.
NintendoManiac64 said, F you to this bloody nose I got on the toilet.
Better a bloody nose than a... Never mind.
Um...
Ninja Bunny with X's around it says, F you to SUVs because they hit my motorcycle.
I want to say F you to this SUV I saw today parked in between spaces at the restaurant.
Oh, man.
What do those people think they are?
DarkTeksuya says, F you to Uebol for finally getting the hint.
Popanda21 says, Speaking of dragons...
FU to not being able to download Kuro Kuro Rock or Sunday Bloody Sunday without it being messed up.
Stupid drama created by my bitches and hoes.
Gotta smack a bitch up.
And FU to school and college and friction.
Burn on penises in the Oscars.
Fiend.
Where's my music?
Thank you.
Legend of Zaku says, FU to giving an already intoxicated girl at a party in my apartment a shot of Rumpelmintz since that one got her passed out as well as feeling guilty about giving her the shot.
You college kids and your drunkenness.
Ranma says, F you to bamaniiso.ws for banning me.
I tried to do my share and keep torrents up and I got capped for it.
I already got capped twice for sharing torrents for you guys, but y'all ain't paying my cable bills, so fuck you, you fucking pricks.
Oh, and FYI, your torrents will always be leaked out to other sites, so suck it.
Hey, you want to get back at him?
Report him!
Turn him in!
SSJ100, ruin it for everybody.
SSJ100, Matt says...
F you to my anti-semitic neighbor who password locked out my network and changed it to secure your network you dumbass Jew and changed my router name to dumb faggot Jew.
It took me a long time to fix everything he messed up and get my internet working correctly all because he hates me and my family for being Jewish.
That's like real... Can you believe that that exists?
That's not funny!
Can you believe that that exists in the world?
Sick!
I'm going home to rename my router.
Not everyone is heavily armed or wearing armor so that they'll put up a fight, morons.
If there's any chicks there, I wanna do them!
That's the other kind of old play.
And Tomo-kun, last but not least, says fuck me for not paying attention, fuck Verizon, fuck the creepy guys at the arcade, picking up my 15-year-old friend.
Dude, she said she was 17 and a half.
That's it for another edition of Orange Lounge Radio to Afterbirth.
AskANinja.com
You know, we gotta have... If we ever become a TV show, that would be a great thing.
Dude, they're bigger than we are already.
They've been featured on iTunes, like, four weeks in a row.
They were featured on the news!
We were featured on iTunes once, and in a dark, black corner somewhere, and, you know, we were lucky to really even get that.
But, um, you know, it's just... You know what's funny?
They featured a video game podcast, I think, like...
Probably four times since iTunes has gone up.
The only time we were ever mentioned on iTunes was under Interesting Indies, which is kind of cool.
But you know what?
The Video Game Podcast, we've never been featured.
Bobby's never been featured.
I don't know if All Games Interactive was.
Maybe once.
But you know who most of them are that get featured?
G4 Replays, the X-Play Podcast, probably Attack of the Show Podcast and all that.
You can turn on your TV and watch, which defeats the purpose of podcasting.
Actually, no, you couldn't turn your TV on and watch it because they would be playing Star Trek Next Generation, The Man Show, Fastlane, and Banzai.
Oh, because that show failed on two different networks.
What is it, G4, the place where shows finally go to die?
It's like, let's breathe life into them once more and hope that it does well.
Don't you miss G4 back when it only kinda sucked?
I know, I would have been so much nicer to G4 in the beginning.
I would have said, every show on there is awesome, I love it, I'm a big fan of everybody.
Or like the electric playground or filter.
I know.
Like, I love Diane Miazoa, she's my hero.
Like, you know... You know, even though I'm gay, she's still pretty hot.
I mean, I gotta admit.
She is!
Have you seen her in the Mario cosplay?
Is she the one that counts down things?
Yeah, she counts down things on her little show, but it got canned.
I think, I wanna say she's on the, uh, I think I saw her on the Andy Grant... Was she on the Andy Grant show?
Three Wishes?
I don't know, but she's on Trains, Spaces, like, Kids or something.
Alright, anyway.
Um... That, that, that, that, that, that, that.
Small corrections here.
Bobby, of course, says that All Games Interactive actually was featured on iTunes once, but it was under New and Notable.
So that's what makes this little partnership we have going on interesting, is that neither one of us are good enough to be featured as a video game podcast.
And I use good enough with loose quotes there, as you know.
Put Morgan Webb on your album art and shit, you'll be featured every week.
She's really awesome, though, but has a small head.
She is.
That's the one thing I got out of E3 that year.
Her head is really tiny.
The show's over.
Yeah, I got his autograph, like, at the Nintendo Power Fest in, like, 19- I still want to know what dumpster our sampler CD ended up in, Loki.
I don't know.
They probably, like,
G4 was also the channel that brought us video game vixens.
Hey, at least that has something to do with video games.
That's a good point.
Alright, we're done with G4 bashing, honestly.
That's so, you know, yesterday.
Anyway, let's get this show done with.
Here's your fortune cookie message.
Oh, final, final, final, final thoughts.
Mikotov.
The new Power Ranger sucks, except for the Green Ranger.
Don't look at me like that.
Spike, final, final, final, super duper last thought.
If you have anything.
Tommy Tallarico's just way too short.
Uh, Loki.
What the hell was that really crappy show that was on that station that featured, like, the MMO skits and that guy named Dave who talked to a computer that didn't really exist?
Wasn't that, um, um... Portal!
Goddamn Portal suck!
Never mind, I take it all back!
Portal fucking suck!
No, you know what?
You know what?
I would rather have that.
I would rather have that than what we have now.
And I take back everything I said.
