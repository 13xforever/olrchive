00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:38,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio Hello everybody and welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio, this being episode number 176 of

[SPEAKER_05]: for this March the 12th of 2006

00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:09,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, my name is Rob Roberts.

00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:10,983
[SPEAKER_05]: You might know me as Sky.

00:01:11,023 --> 00:01:14,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

7
00:01:15,144 --> 00:01:15,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Boo.

8
00:01:15,664 --> 00:01:16,184
[SPEAKER_05]: How you doing?

9
00:01:16,905 --> 00:01:18,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Ugh.

10
00:01:18,425 --> 00:01:19,105
[SPEAKER_05]: What's frustrating?

11
00:01:19,265 --> 00:01:21,546
[SPEAKER_05]: You were in such a good mood just like two minutes ago.

12
00:01:21,846 --> 00:01:24,367
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't in a good mood because your mocha attacked me.

13
00:01:24,967 --> 00:01:27,288
[SPEAKER_05]: I do appreciate the... I'm chocolatey good.

14
00:01:28,608 --> 00:01:28,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn it.

15
00:01:29,668 --> 00:01:34,470
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now you smell like chocolate, so... I smelled like cherries before.

16
00:01:35,157 --> 00:01:35,697
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather.

17
00:01:35,937 --> 00:01:38,719
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, chocolate-covered cherries is a delicacy in some places.

18
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Say hello also to Tech Master Loki.

19
00:01:43,262 --> 00:01:43,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

20
00:01:43,782 --> 00:01:44,342
[SPEAKER_05]: How you doing?

21
00:01:44,983 --> 00:01:45,843
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing great.

22
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:46,283
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

23
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:46,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds good.

24
00:01:47,704 --> 00:01:50,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Once in a while, we like to invite somebody special to come on the show.

25
00:01:51,046 --> 00:01:53,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Say hello to our local buddy, Bugged.

26
00:01:53,828 --> 00:01:54,708
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just special now?

27
00:01:55,669 --> 00:01:56,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you're very special.

28
00:01:56,689 --> 00:01:56,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

29
00:01:57,129 --> 00:01:58,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Bugged has known me for how long?

30
00:01:58,810 --> 00:01:59,691
[SPEAKER_05]: How long have you known me, Bugged?

31
00:01:59,711 --> 00:02:00,571
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't admit this.

32
00:02:00,951 --> 00:02:01,172
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

33
00:02:01,352 --> 00:02:01,792
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I can't.

34
00:02:02,048 --> 00:02:02,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

35
00:02:02,408 --> 00:02:03,429
[SPEAKER_05]: I just can't.

36
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:04,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then I'll say it.

37
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:07,470
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably been at least... 17 years?

38
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,450
[SPEAKER_05]: You're kidding.

39
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:09,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my gosh.

40
00:02:09,711 --> 00:02:11,311
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I guess it has been 10 years since high school.

41
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,032
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I didn't want to... Oh, my God.

42
00:02:13,192 --> 00:02:13,252
[SPEAKER_05]: See?

43
00:02:13,612 --> 00:02:14,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

44
00:02:15,173 --> 00:02:18,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of our listeners are 17, even younger than that.

45
00:02:18,474 --> 00:02:19,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my gosh.

46
00:02:19,054 --> 00:02:19,294
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

47
00:02:19,334 --> 00:02:20,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Well... I'll go get the canes.

48
00:02:20,835 --> 00:02:21,095
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

49
00:02:22,031 --> 00:02:25,672
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

50
00:02:52,116 --> 00:02:53,457
[SPEAKER_00]: I quit school to play video games.

51
00:02:53,897 --> 00:02:56,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Way to set an example for those 17-year-olds listening.

52
00:02:56,779 --> 00:02:58,900
[SPEAKER_00]: I dropped a class due to time constraints.

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,401
[SPEAKER_00]: I've played Animal Crossing and Puzzle Fighter.

54
00:03:02,942 --> 00:03:03,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Puzzle Fighter?

55
00:03:03,702 --> 00:03:04,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that's an oldie but goodie.

56
00:03:04,563 --> 00:03:09,085
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've had some burnout going on in the house, and I've been avoiding it like the plague.

57
00:03:09,126 --> 00:03:09,406
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?

58
00:03:09,806 --> 00:03:11,047
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that game gives me a headache.

59
00:03:11,307 --> 00:03:12,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, because of all the motion and stuff?

60
00:03:13,288 --> 00:03:14,829
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

61
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:18,871
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because of the really loudness that Dan has our TV turned up to you.

62
00:03:19,895 --> 00:03:21,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Puzzle Fighter Puzzle Fighter Puzzle Fighter

63
00:03:33,188 --> 00:03:36,591
[SPEAKER_00]: That made me twitch because it just made me realize that, yes, I am older than you are.

64
00:03:36,751 --> 00:03:37,271
[SPEAKER_00]: Not by much.

65
00:03:37,311 --> 00:03:44,677
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what I was playing in college was the Saturn had just come out and my friend imported one and we were playing Gundam.

66
00:03:45,057 --> 00:03:50,981
[SPEAKER_00]: If it makes you feel better, that was like... KOF 95 and I had a PlayStation in my room and we were playing Toshinden all the time.

67
00:03:51,182 --> 00:03:52,743
[SPEAKER_05]: If it makes you feel better, this was like...

68
00:03:54,051 --> 00:03:54,931
[SPEAKER_05]: My junior year.

69
00:03:55,031 --> 00:03:59,193
[SPEAKER_05]: My freshman year was all about Super Mario Kart because I was the only kid in the dorm with a Super Nintendo.

70
00:03:59,213 --> 00:04:00,273
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a Super Nintendo.

71
00:04:00,693 --> 00:04:03,014
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, you're making me cry because of next month.

72
00:04:03,454 --> 00:04:05,975
[SPEAKER_07]: You're also one of the few that were sober.

73
00:04:06,555 --> 00:04:07,855
[SPEAKER_00]: My birthday is next month.

74
00:04:07,895 --> 00:04:10,536
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, but you're having a big birthday extravaganza, right?

75
00:04:11,436 --> 00:04:11,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't wait.

76
00:04:12,337 --> 00:04:14,977
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I get so drunk I forget that it's my birthday.

77
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:18,499
[SPEAKER_05]: And this year you might need that.

78
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:19,779
[SPEAKER_05]: But don't we still love you?

79
00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:21,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Age is just a number.

80
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah.

81
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,160
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

82
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, how's your gaming week been?

83
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:25,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

84
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:37,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Been playing both the new Burnout, well, not quite new Burnout, new to the Xbox 360 Burnout, and Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter.

85
00:04:37,863 --> 00:04:40,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Burnout hasn't really changed.

86
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:52,367
[SPEAKER_03]: They made it a lot blurrier and, I guess, higher resolution textures, but everything's so blurry and dark, it's, I don't know, it's tough sometimes finding out where you're going.

87
00:04:52,527 --> 00:04:53,207
[SPEAKER_00]: Headache-inducing?

88
00:04:53,561 --> 00:05:03,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Not headache-inducing, but just, you know, trying to see down like a tunnel where you're driving 200 miles an hour and everything's like I got cataracts or something.

89
00:05:03,163 --> 00:05:04,363
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not good.

90
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:16,206
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like what they're doing with these games where they're putting this like halo effect on everything so to, you know, to hide the fact that the textures aren't quite as good as they should be and the edges aren't quite as smooth as they should be.

91
00:05:17,346 --> 00:05:18,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, we know that

92
00:05:18,803 --> 00:05:29,854
[SPEAKER_03]: you know the case is that these textures aren't as good or the graphics aren't as good you don't need to try to hide it by making everything blurry don't pull a Nintendo 64 now I'm curious how does

93
00:05:30,356 --> 00:05:33,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Burnout is more racing, whereas Full Auto is more blowing stuff up.

94
00:05:34,018 --> 00:05:35,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, they do have crash mode in Burnout.

95
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Burnout lacks weapons.

96
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you don't have weapons.

97
00:05:57,511 --> 00:06:02,293
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, for some reason, the burnout on the 360 is a lot harder than I remember being on the PlayStation 2.

98
00:06:03,794 --> 00:06:06,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you smash in the cars and they just do not want to crash.

99
00:06:07,156 --> 00:06:11,399
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really, you know, the AI is a lot harder this time, which I guess is good.

100
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:14,161
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, the crash junctions are still fun stuff.

101
00:06:14,181 --> 00:06:15,902
[SPEAKER_03]: And the graphics are a little bit better.

102
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:20,104
[SPEAKER_03]: The car models are more detailed, so you see more damage being done to them.

103
00:06:20,164 --> 00:06:23,066
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not like, ooh, this is a brand new game.

104
00:06:23,126 --> 00:06:26,348
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm waiting for the next burnout to come out, and that'll be good.

105
00:06:27,455 --> 00:06:34,767
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm willing to take donations of Xbox 360s, Burnout, and FlatOut to make all these... Full auto.

106
00:06:35,368 --> 00:06:36,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever the hell the thing's called.

107
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,571
[SPEAKER_07]: FlatOut sucked.

108
00:06:37,992 --> 00:06:38,813
[SPEAKER_07]: It just FlatOut sucked.

109
00:06:39,094 --> 00:06:41,618
[SPEAKER_03]: FlatOut 2's coming out soon as well.

110
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:43,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter.

111
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:44,906
[SPEAKER_03]: What can I say about that?

112
00:06:45,126 --> 00:06:46,127
[SPEAKER_03]: The game is beautiful.

113
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:48,848
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just amazing.

114
00:06:48,928 --> 00:06:52,329
[SPEAKER_03]: This is probably one of the killer apps for the 360.

115
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:56,471
[SPEAKER_03]: The only problem is the learning curve is incredibly high.

116
00:06:56,951 --> 00:07:01,433
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, I have never played a Ghost Recon game in my life and I tried this today.

117
00:07:01,993 --> 00:07:30,031
[SPEAKER_03]: now granted it's very pretty and stuff and I kind of got the you know handle of how to work things but actually throwing me down into missions is about as effective as throwing me down into a mission in Call of Duty 2 on veteran mode and basically it's like you know walking into the Iraq war without any training and hoping to survive it's just not I don't know it could be fun I really need to like get better at it but the game itself looks amazing just

118
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:35,469
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole story part where you're flying over Mexico City, it's just wow.

119
00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:36,510
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really good.

120
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:41,433
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on top of that, of course, I've been playing Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories.

121
00:07:41,913 --> 00:07:46,256
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very excited that they're going to be releasing a new Grand Theft Auto on the PSP soon.

122
00:07:46,496 --> 00:07:49,838
[SPEAKER_03]: And Liberty City Stories is supposed to be coming out on the PlayStation 2 at the end of April.

123
00:07:50,318 --> 00:07:51,279
[SPEAKER_03]: So that should be interesting.

124
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:53,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully we'll have online multiplayer with that.

125
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:56,280
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

126
00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:16,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

127
00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:30,460
[SPEAKER_03]: and it says the number of races hasn't gone up.

128
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,560
[SPEAKER_03]: So nothing's counting.

129
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:34,482
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm wasting my damn time on this stupid thing.

130
00:08:34,522 --> 00:08:36,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that because people are dropping before the race is actually finished?

131
00:08:37,063 --> 00:08:42,085
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the case is, but there is a big problem with people dropping out of the races in this game.

132
00:08:43,486 --> 00:08:44,326
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really bad.

133
00:08:44,947 --> 00:08:46,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Half the players drop out at the very end.

134
00:08:47,007 --> 00:08:48,168
[SPEAKER_03]: You ever leave them negative feedback?

135
00:08:48,448 --> 00:08:49,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I have a problem.

136
00:08:49,349 --> 00:08:52,411
[SPEAKER_05]: People randomly boot me from games in Marble Blast.

137
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:55,332
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not like I'm any good, so I don't know why they're booting me from the game.

138
00:08:55,352 --> 00:08:57,534
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even have a headset, so it's not like I can trash talk them.

139
00:08:57,814 --> 00:08:58,875
[SPEAKER_05]: But they boot me from the game.

140
00:08:59,295 --> 00:09:01,976
[SPEAKER_05]: So I leave them negative feedback when they do that.

141
00:09:02,337 --> 00:09:07,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a lot of times it's hard for me to remember who's dropped out of the game because they're not going to appear at the very end.

142
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, I don't know.

143
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:12,643
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to get the last few achievements in full auto.

144
00:09:12,923 --> 00:09:14,164
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are the online ones.

145
00:09:14,224 --> 00:09:15,725
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm up to rank 8 right now.

146
00:09:16,687 --> 00:09:20,648
[SPEAKER_03]: So I only have two more to go, but it's really hard when it's not counting half the races that you're playing.

147
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:23,790
[SPEAKER_03]: I could be playing it for three hours and only count two races.

148
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,730
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just a waste of time.

149
00:09:26,531 --> 00:09:28,311
[SPEAKER_03]: And they really need to fix this kind of stuff.

150
00:09:29,752 --> 00:09:38,655
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get into this later about how these games are coming out really glitchy and buggy, and they're just letting it go to market real quick because they can fix it later by patching it.

151
00:09:39,455 --> 00:09:41,056
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just a poor excuse of programming.

152
00:09:42,337 --> 00:09:42,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else?

153
00:09:43,938 --> 00:09:44,258
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

154
00:09:45,098 --> 00:09:46,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Bugged, anything in your gaming week?

155
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:49,959
[SPEAKER_07]: No, actually I started up Diablo 2 again.

156
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:52,720
[SPEAKER_07]: I started up Diablo 2 again.

157
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:59,122
[SPEAKER_07]: And been bringing up old characters that I've found laying around on other old CDs.

158
00:09:59,722 --> 00:10:01,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there still a big online community for Diablo 2?

159
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:02,523
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care.

160
00:10:03,943 --> 00:10:04,663
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't play online?

161
00:10:04,843 --> 00:10:05,023
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

162
00:10:05,904 --> 00:10:11,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes I'll play with other local people, set up Hamachi to do local network sort of thing.

163
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:15,906
[SPEAKER_07]: With Hamachi, it looks like everybody's on the same network.

164
00:10:18,286 --> 00:10:21,287
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't touched Diablo 2 in probably years.

165
00:10:21,967 --> 00:10:23,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever played World of Warcraft?

166
00:10:23,528 --> 00:10:23,688
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

167
00:10:23,888 --> 00:10:25,028
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of surprised.

168
00:10:25,688 --> 00:10:27,389
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, there's a lot of similarities.

169
00:10:27,449 --> 00:10:29,849
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't do subscription games.

170
00:10:29,869 --> 00:10:30,149
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

171
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:31,590
[SPEAKER_07]: That whole lack of funding.

172
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever thought about Guild Wars?

173
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:33,530
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

174
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Guild Wars isn't subscription-based.

175
00:10:35,891 --> 00:10:36,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but it's not World of Warcraft.

176
00:10:42,018 --> 00:10:49,504
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll stick to Blizzard.

177
00:10:50,845 --> 00:10:52,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely no fucking Final Fantasy shit.

178
00:10:53,947 --> 00:10:55,248
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's funny about Final Fantasy?

179
00:10:55,468 --> 00:10:56,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know you two are going back into it.

180
00:10:57,589 --> 00:11:00,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Shane's trying to get me back into Final Fantasy XI and I think I'm going to do it.

181
00:11:01,352 --> 00:11:01,632
[SPEAKER_00]: Addict.

182
00:11:02,301 --> 00:11:04,563
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna start over on a new server.

183
00:11:04,803 --> 00:11:09,247
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, though, you going back to that actually reminds me, I did do something else gaming-related.

184
00:11:09,447 --> 00:11:09,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh?

185
00:11:10,187 --> 00:11:12,229
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm downloading Ragnarok Online again.

186
00:11:12,349 --> 00:11:12,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God.

187
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:13,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Addict.

188
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,712
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be playing Ragnarok Online on a private server.

189
00:11:16,933 --> 00:11:20,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that sad that we've all gone back to the crack games that we used to play?

190
00:11:20,576 --> 00:11:25,459
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't go back to World of Warcraft until after I get finances sold, so, like, well, crap.

191
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,081
[SPEAKER_00]: I need gaming crack.

192
00:11:27,101 --> 00:11:29,743
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm actually still paying for PSO Blueburst, and I forgot...

193
00:11:30,535 --> 00:11:33,858
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna be playing, I'll play PSO So you have to pay for live plus PSO?

194
00:11:33,878 --> 00:11:36,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless you're Julie She hasn't had to, they haven't billed her

195
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:56,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks to the new setup on Xbox 360, I think games like Final Fantasy XI, that won't apply.

196
00:11:56,856 --> 00:11:59,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there's the whole Xbox Live Silver and Xbox Live Gold.

197
00:12:00,297 --> 00:12:01,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you don't pay for Silver.

198
00:12:02,018 --> 00:12:03,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Silver comes with your Xbox 360.

199
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:08,400
[SPEAKER_05]: And Silver is enough to get your account and your basics and see who's online and stuff.

200
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,241
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can't actually play games against people.

201
00:12:10,761 --> 00:12:14,203
[SPEAKER_05]: But Silver is all you need to connect to play online.

202
00:12:14,303 --> 00:12:16,023
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you pay Sony to do their thing.

203
00:12:16,063 --> 00:12:17,024
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like Windows XP.

204
00:12:17,424 --> 00:12:17,824
[SPEAKER_07]: In a way.

205
00:12:19,048 --> 00:12:21,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you can get online, but you can't do shit until you actually buy the real stuff.

206
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:27,617
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're going to see a lot of connectivity between Windows Vista, especially, and the Xbox 360.

207
00:12:28,358 --> 00:12:32,602
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's just very natural that Microsoft's going to try and interlink all that best we can.

208
00:12:32,803 --> 00:12:33,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.

209
00:12:33,604 --> 00:12:34,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

210
00:12:34,404 --> 00:12:36,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they're already trying to link the Media Center Edition 2005 version.

211
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:42,362
[SPEAKER_07]: All the ads for the Gateway machines coming out with that are listing.

212
00:12:42,842 --> 00:12:45,203
[SPEAKER_07]: If you look at the bottom, it says compatible with Xbox 360.

213
00:12:45,403 --> 00:12:50,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know I saw some link on the internet somewhere where you can link your Mac to the Xbox 360 now.

214
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, something like that.

215
00:12:51,506 --> 00:12:55,868
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was going to check that out for my new little lappy laptop, Mr. iBook.

216
00:12:56,488 --> 00:12:58,369
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I'm probably going to get back into Final Fantasy XI.

217
00:12:58,409 --> 00:13:03,251
[SPEAKER_05]: At least I'm going to try it and see if I can rediscover my love for the game.

218
00:13:03,271 --> 00:13:07,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you know I left the game because the Gil selling thing got out of control and they banned all those people, so

219
00:13:08,134 --> 00:13:09,394
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to give it another shot.

220
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:18,056
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to try... I am really curious about this expansion that's coming out for Final Fantasy XI, The Treasures of Odd Organ, especially because now they have the Puppet Masterclass, which looks pretty cool.

221
00:13:18,176 --> 00:13:26,398
[SPEAKER_05]: They just added this week, announced, and you know, Blue Mage, and Shane's really excited about being a pirate, so he's trying to convince me to get back into it.

222
00:13:26,538 --> 00:13:27,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Corsair, sorry.

223
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,399
[SPEAKER_05]: He's trying to convince me to get back into it, and I'm like, okay.

224
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:31,379
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

225
00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:32,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Buck Pirate, Rectal Buccaneer.

226
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:33,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up.

227
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:34,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else?

228
00:13:36,095 --> 00:13:37,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's see, my gaming week.

229
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:42,462
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been playing a little bit of Xbox 360, Loki loaned me some games.

230
00:13:42,482 --> 00:13:45,885
[SPEAKER_05]: I was playing Perfect Dark Zero, which I just, I'm sorry, I couldn't get into it.

231
00:13:46,246 --> 00:13:48,088
[SPEAKER_05]: I see why people really enjoy this game.

232
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:51,231
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, as far as first-person shooters go, it is pretty intricate and a lot of fun.

233
00:13:51,636 --> 00:13:52,197
[SPEAKER_05]: RIDGERACER 6

234
00:14:12,296 --> 00:14:12,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Ridge Racer Cameo

235
00:14:30,523 --> 00:14:36,005
[SPEAKER_05]: The first time I played it, it was all like really overwhelming to me, like that first level that you have to go through.

236
00:14:36,525 --> 00:14:43,087
[SPEAKER_05]: But once you beat that level, like there's a story event that happens that kind of makes you start again from scratch.

237
00:14:43,788 --> 00:14:46,629
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I felt that was kind of a better way to kind of start the game for me.

238
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:48,409
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of learning everything from scratch.

239
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:49,510
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

240
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,091
[SPEAKER_05]: It was easier for me to get into when I wasn't like overwhelmed with everything at once.

241
00:14:53,471 --> 00:14:57,332
[SPEAKER_05]: But to the game's credit, it's got a pretty good help system in it.

242
00:14:57,372 --> 00:14:58,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you can always ask your little, like,

243
00:14:59,628 --> 00:15:03,272
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like in Zelda, you know how that fairy follows you, and you can always ask the fairy for help?

244
00:15:03,572 --> 00:15:07,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, in this one, it's a little dude that's in the book, and you can always ask the book for help.

245
00:15:08,177 --> 00:15:10,720
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, it helps idiots like me find their way through the game.

246
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of like Partners in Time?

247
00:15:12,562 --> 00:15:15,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sure a lot of games adapt this same idea now, so...

248
00:15:18,099 --> 00:15:21,421
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm enjoying that game and just other stuff on Xbox Live Arcade.

249
00:15:22,162 --> 00:15:25,184
[SPEAKER_05]: I have probably downloaded damn near every game they offer on Xbox Live Arcade.

250
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:25,724
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of sad.

251
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:26,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Not everything.

252
00:15:26,645 --> 00:15:30,608
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't get Backgammon or Hearts or any of that crap, but I did get... I got Bejeweled.

253
00:15:30,688 --> 00:15:31,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Why did I buy Bejeweled?

254
00:15:31,608 --> 00:15:31,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

255
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,049
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why.

256
00:15:33,109 --> 00:15:33,390
[SPEAKER_05]: I just...

257
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:37,391
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, because I'm a sucker, and I wanted to play it in pretty, pretty HD.

258
00:15:39,391 --> 00:15:41,812
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to see if I could get some more achievement points, but here's the thing.

259
00:15:41,852 --> 00:15:45,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Bejeweled has harder achievement points than any game I've seen on Xbox Live Arcade.

260
00:15:45,933 --> 00:15:50,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, you have to be a Bejeweled master to get achievement points in that game.

261
00:15:50,734 --> 00:15:51,234
[SPEAKER_05]: It's sick.

262
00:15:51,414 --> 00:15:57,195
[SPEAKER_03]: The best bet for achievement points, and I was reading, they actually have this article that's on GameSpot right now.

263
00:15:57,635 --> 00:16:00,856
[SPEAKER_03]: It's how to score 6,000 easy achievement points.

264
00:16:01,431 --> 00:16:05,334
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's sports games are where you get the freaking easy-ass points.

265
00:16:06,115 --> 00:16:07,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

266
00:16:08,056 --> 00:16:11,118
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to our chat room, www.orangeslaunchradio.com.

267
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:13,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Click on chat, reading some feedback here in the chat room.

268
00:16:14,621 --> 00:16:16,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

269
00:16:16,282 --> 00:16:18,604
[SPEAKER_05]: GK128 says, Cameo is terrible.

270
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,206
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I'd call it terrible.

271
00:16:21,546 --> 00:16:23,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it as good as Zelda?

272
00:16:23,207 --> 00:16:23,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell no.

273
00:16:24,268 --> 00:16:25,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it even as good as Fable?

274
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:26,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably not.

275
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,092
[SPEAKER_05]: But is it entertaining for me for a little while?

276
00:16:29,192 --> 00:16:29,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

277
00:16:29,632 --> 00:16:30,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it worth $60?

278
00:16:30,052 --> 00:16:30,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

279
00:16:31,368 --> 00:16:32,609
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

280
00:16:54,406 --> 00:16:56,227
[SPEAKER_03]: and you have to use these gems.

281
00:16:56,788 --> 00:16:58,169
[SPEAKER_00]: That just illustrates something to me.

282
00:16:58,329 --> 00:16:58,569
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

283
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:05,174
[SPEAKER_00]: That when people say, oh this sucks, say specifically why so that people have some idea what you're talking about.

284
00:17:05,214 --> 00:17:07,997
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, some of the dialogue in the game is a little lame.

285
00:17:08,117 --> 00:17:17,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they have these real lame jokes, like you said, like the old guy in the book and the little witch with one eye or whatever have this little back and forth thing going on, but it's really like canned humor.

286
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:20,706
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like canned sitcom laughter type jokes.

287
00:17:20,846 --> 00:17:21,427
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty bad.

288
00:17:21,932 --> 00:17:29,641
[SPEAKER_05]: So honestly, you put a game like Cameo next to a Zelda or next to a better type of adventure game, and it is kind of sad.

289
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:36,649
[SPEAKER_05]: But you have to remember, it's a launch title, and launch titles usually, unless you're Nintendo, aren't your best games.

290
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:41,234
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite games ever that was a launch title was Jumping Flash.

291
00:17:42,543 --> 00:17:43,183
[SPEAKER_00]: on PlayStation.

292
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:44,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I don't even remember that.

293
00:17:44,444 --> 00:17:45,805
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little mechanical rabbit.

294
00:17:46,445 --> 00:17:48,386
[SPEAKER_00]: And I played the hell out of the demo.

295
00:17:48,586 --> 00:17:50,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's the thing about Cameo.

296
00:17:50,287 --> 00:17:53,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Cameo's more like Spyro than it is like Zelda.

297
00:17:54,009 --> 00:17:57,491
[SPEAKER_03]: They were trying to position it to be like a Zelda killer, and no.

298
00:17:58,011 --> 00:18:02,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, isn't it more like the Banjo-Kazooie or Banjo-Tooie or whatever?

299
00:18:02,794 --> 00:18:06,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Which was just made to exist, not necessarily be good.

300
00:18:08,261 --> 00:18:20,151
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing that they need to keep in mind is that when you're trying to come up with a game that's going to go against the big names, not only do they have quality to worry about, they also have reputation to worry about.

301
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:27,737
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sorry, nothing's going to really dethrone the Zelda franchise, the Final Fantasy franchise, the Phantasy Star.

302
00:18:28,678 --> 00:18:29,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Besides itself.

303
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:35,223
[SPEAKER_05]: I was reading in the chat room before the show started a lot of hate going around for Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.

304
00:18:35,723 --> 00:18:39,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy Mystic Quest Final Fantasy Mystic Quest Final Fantasy USA

305
00:19:04,653 --> 00:19:08,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that just, I could have sworn I read that somewhere and I'm like, that just makes us look bad.

306
00:19:08,434 --> 00:19:13,096
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried playing, well, then again, our Super Mario 2 was out over there, Super Mario USA.

307
00:19:14,376 --> 00:19:17,637
[SPEAKER_05]: But it had already existed over there in, what, Doki Doki Panic, right?

308
00:19:17,817 --> 00:19:19,158
[SPEAKER_05]: But differently, you know.

309
00:19:19,338 --> 00:19:20,138
[SPEAKER_00]: But it wasn't Mario.

310
00:19:20,358 --> 00:19:21,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

311
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:24,140
[SPEAKER_05]: It's amazing what a little Italian plumber can do for your game, huh?

312
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:34,263
[SPEAKER_00]: But also keep in mind, though, that a lot of times when we get the RPGs over here, they repackage it for Japan as the international version because it's got more stuff in it.

313
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Square does that an awful lot.

314
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,901
[SPEAKER_05]: I think about 10 and all that stuff.

315
00:19:39,361 --> 00:19:41,862
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's get into some gaming news.

316
00:19:42,963 --> 00:19:46,365
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we're here to do, let you guys know what's going on in the gaming world and bitch about it.

317
00:19:47,105 --> 00:19:48,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, we're going to start off with you tonight.

318
00:19:48,406 --> 00:19:50,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's something some PSP owners might bitch about.

319
00:19:50,767 --> 00:19:51,187
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think?

320
00:19:51,907 --> 00:19:53,048
[SPEAKER_03]: They redesigned the PSP.

321
00:19:53,268 --> 00:19:53,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Not surprising.

322
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:56,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it's something we've been talking about for weeks now.

323
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:03,313
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just kind of, you know, I don't know, not very surprising.

324
00:20:04,012 --> 00:20:05,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, this comes from Any Cool News.

325
00:20:05,912 --> 00:20:21,735
[SPEAKER_03]: It's this guy, Joseph Merrick, who's saying that he's got the insider information about their new PSP system, including that it's going to be a more sleeker, slimmed-down version of the PSP, including a 4GB flash drive and a digital camera.

326
00:20:24,176 --> 00:20:25,756
[SPEAKER_03]: No word on what the price is going to be.

327
00:20:25,856 --> 00:20:27,036
[SPEAKER_05]: How Nintendo of them.

328
00:20:27,116 --> 00:20:29,117
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's supposed to be released around Christmas.

329
00:20:31,811 --> 00:20:35,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this Sony doing a knee-jerk reaction to the insanity of the DS Lite in Japan?

330
00:20:36,255 --> 00:20:39,877
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so, but here's the thing about the PSP.

331
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:48,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you're pirating games to the memory stick, I don't know why you would need more than a gig.

332
00:20:48,784 --> 00:20:49,064
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

333
00:20:50,427 --> 00:20:51,008
[SPEAKER_03]: 4 gigs 4 gigs 4 gigs

334
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:23,988
[SPEAKER_03]: It's facing the user, so it would be used as a webcam.

335
00:21:24,248 --> 00:21:25,289
[SPEAKER_03]: We're watching you.

336
00:21:25,729 --> 00:21:30,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is kind of stupid, but obviously I'm sure that's going to be fixed later on.

337
00:21:31,454 --> 00:21:33,136
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see the real need for this.

338
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:37,580
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, a 4 gig hard drive in there as well.

339
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it going to be a hard drive or flash?

340
00:21:39,602 --> 00:21:40,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Flash.

341
00:21:40,062 --> 00:21:42,084
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be probably a micro drive or something like that.

342
00:21:42,905 --> 00:21:44,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Micro drive is hard drive.

343
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:45,588
[SPEAKER_03]: or whatever.

344
00:21:45,608 --> 00:21:46,689
[SPEAKER_03]: NAND flash drive.

345
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:48,670
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes more sense.

346
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:52,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Because adding another rotating media just sucks more battery life.

347
00:21:53,032 --> 00:21:53,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

348
00:21:53,632 --> 00:21:54,933
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

349
00:21:55,053 --> 00:21:55,693
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting.

350
00:21:55,713 --> 00:21:59,495
[SPEAKER_03]: It's supposed to come out sometime around Christmas.

351
00:21:59,535 --> 00:22:04,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully the PS3 will be coming out at the same time because I heard they're having a lot of trouble with that.

352
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they going to do different colors and all that stuff too?

353
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,020
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure they'll do it.

354
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,221
[SPEAKER_03]: They have white and black right now.

355
00:22:12,801 --> 00:22:13,662
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll probably come out with some

356
00:22:14,781 --> 00:22:17,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Other colors that can get blue, pink.

357
00:22:17,883 --> 00:22:23,345
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I've been a little tough on the PSP lately, but it does sound like there are some good new stuff coming out for it.

358
00:22:24,306 --> 00:22:25,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially game-wise.

359
00:22:25,826 --> 00:22:29,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully with this new PSP, they'll come out with a second goddamn analog stick.

360
00:22:30,269 --> 00:22:32,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they friggin' need on this thing.

361
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:34,491
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't want them to change it that radically.

362
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:41,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Because now me having a first-gen PSP who's not really interested in upgrading, I'd be totally screwed if games started supporting it.

363
00:22:41,494 --> 00:22:43,575
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like the whole Xbox 360 hard drive thing.

364
00:22:44,235 --> 00:22:48,360
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've got a core with no hard drive, you're going to get screwed in some of these later releases when people require it.

365
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:48,860
[SPEAKER_03]: So what?

366
00:22:49,181 --> 00:22:49,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing.

367
00:22:50,022 --> 00:22:52,965
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, look at the games that came out for the late PlayStation stuff.

368
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:54,867
[SPEAKER_03]: They supported only the DualShock 2.

369
00:22:55,028 --> 00:22:56,990
[SPEAKER_03]: If you didn't buy a DualShock controller, you're fucked.

370
00:22:57,691 --> 00:22:59,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh well, that's going to be the case with this.

371
00:22:59,913 --> 00:23:11,318
[SPEAKER_03]: They needed to have a goddamn second analog stick on this because you try, you know, controlling, I don't know, say for example in Katamari, you try controlling your Katamari, the four buttons, doesn't work.

372
00:23:11,638 --> 00:23:12,979
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not as good as an analog stick.

373
00:23:12,999 --> 00:23:21,502
[SPEAKER_03]: They need another analog stick on there because it'll just be so much better for a lot, especially if they're first person shooter games that they have coming out for this, it'd be a whole lot better.

374
00:23:22,743 --> 00:23:23,003
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

375
00:23:23,871 --> 00:23:25,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy XII

376
00:23:42,472 --> 00:23:46,596
[SPEAKER_05]: The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, Soul Calibur, Vagrant Story, Zelda The Wind Waker, and Nintendogs

377
00:24:01,328 --> 00:24:02,389
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

378
00:24:26,907 --> 00:24:28,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Have they played Vagrant Story?

379
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:30,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's not that great of a game.

380
00:24:30,652 --> 00:24:35,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, but maybe we have that whole audience in Japan versus audience in the US.

381
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,742
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I played Vagrant Story.

382
00:24:37,762 --> 00:24:39,865
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the Japanese games.

383
00:24:40,506 --> 00:24:41,227
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't that good.

384
00:24:42,438 --> 00:24:44,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Famitsu begs to differ with you.

385
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:51,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, of course, this score is now just building more and more excitement amongst the fanboys that, you know, OMG, this game's coming out soon.

386
00:24:51,265 --> 00:24:53,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, do you know when Final Fantasy XII slated for the US?

387
00:24:54,287 --> 00:24:54,928
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't even remember.

388
00:24:54,968 --> 00:24:55,888
[SPEAKER_05]: It keeps getting juggled around.

389
00:24:55,908 --> 00:24:56,429
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't have a date.

390
00:24:56,449 --> 00:24:57,229
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's eventually.

391
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,012
[SPEAKER_05]: So, like, when Advent Children comes out?

392
00:25:00,092 --> 00:25:00,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, around that same time?

393
00:25:00,852 --> 00:25:01,453
[SPEAKER_00]: Around the same time.

394
00:25:01,973 --> 00:25:02,694
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.

395
00:25:02,714 --> 00:25:04,035
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's the same time we get the PS3.

396
00:25:04,055 --> 00:25:05,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Advent Children is in April.

397
00:25:05,556 --> 00:25:06,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Before the apocalypse.

398
00:25:06,657 --> 00:25:07,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's good.

399
00:25:07,938 --> 00:25:09,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, obviously before Christmas, right?

400
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:10,940
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got to come out before Christmas.

401
00:25:11,901 --> 00:25:12,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

402
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:13,712
[SPEAKER_05]: We know at least that.

403
00:25:13,852 --> 00:25:14,773
[SPEAKER_05]: But Christmas, what year?

404
00:25:15,273 --> 00:25:15,994
[SPEAKER_05]: What decade?

405
00:25:16,134 --> 00:25:16,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

406
00:25:17,035 --> 00:25:18,857
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's move on to another story.

407
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:24,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, another very popular franchise would be, well, anything made by Miyamoto.

408
00:25:24,702 --> 00:25:25,783
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's Miyamoto getting?

409
00:25:26,183 --> 00:25:28,465
[SPEAKER_03]: He's getting knighted by the French.

410
00:25:29,226 --> 00:25:31,648
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if that's more of a compliment or a...

411
00:25:33,485 --> 00:25:34,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, now watch it.

412
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:35,405
[SPEAKER_03]: We might have listeners in France.

413
00:25:35,465 --> 00:25:35,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Be careful.

414
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:02,821
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like wearing some one-up shirt and he has the Zelda sword and shield.

415
00:26:02,841 --> 00:26:06,242
[SPEAKER_03]: He just looks like a dumbass, but it's hilarious.

416
00:26:06,822 --> 00:26:08,322
[SPEAKER_03]: He's just so happy and childish.

417
00:26:10,223 --> 00:26:11,163
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Kojima, though.

418
00:26:11,183 --> 00:26:13,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Or not Kojima, Miyamoto.

419
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:14,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I was thinking of another upcoming story.

420
00:26:14,744 --> 00:26:18,986
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Miyamoto, though, because he's always so animated, like whenever you see him.

421
00:26:19,646 --> 00:26:20,766
[SPEAKER_00]: I bumped into him at E3.

422
00:26:21,186 --> 00:26:21,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

423
00:26:21,946 --> 00:26:22,427
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

424
00:26:22,867 --> 00:26:23,487
[SPEAKER_05]: And you survived?

425
00:26:23,827 --> 00:26:25,087
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and I survived.

426
00:26:25,608 --> 00:26:26,708
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't fall down?

427
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:31,225
[SPEAKER_07]: I bumped into Kojima too, the year before I've been touched by fame I'm a Silent Hill

428
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:47,591
[SPEAKER_00]: We were doing an interview that never recorded.

429
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:50,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't remind me about the lost interview at Konami booth.

430
00:26:50,374 --> 00:26:52,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, let's move on to another story.

431
00:26:53,496 --> 00:26:58,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go over to DarkSakura, who has a story about the Nintendo DS.

432
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,221
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little program out.

433
00:27:00,341 --> 00:27:07,206
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a freeware called Pointy Remote, where you can use your DS to control your computer.

434
00:27:08,953 --> 00:27:10,274
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally haven't tried it.

435
00:27:10,294 --> 00:27:12,596
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not about to go opening up my DS or anything.

436
00:27:13,197 --> 00:27:19,021
[SPEAKER_00]: But it lets you use the touchpad to select icons to zoom in.

437
00:27:20,762 --> 00:27:27,667
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually on oneemulation.com there's a thread actually going on about it for anyone who wants to check it out.

438
00:27:29,308 --> 00:27:30,249
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's

439
00:27:31,147 --> 00:27:33,809
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it's still very experimental.

440
00:27:33,909 --> 00:27:35,471
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still working on it.

441
00:27:35,711 --> 00:27:36,451
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks cool.

442
00:27:36,491 --> 00:27:37,272
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a neat idea.

443
00:27:37,933 --> 00:27:41,375
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly don't think that I would ever bother doing anything like that with my DS.

444
00:27:43,437 --> 00:27:44,918
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think you have to open it up, though.

445
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,343
[SPEAKER_03]: All you'd have to do is just reflash it, I guess.

446
00:27:52,024 --> 00:27:53,625
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel like doing anything to my DS.

447
00:27:53,645 --> 00:27:55,006
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still busy playing Animal Crossing.

448
00:27:56,027 --> 00:27:59,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, my DS is a holy object that cannot be violated by the hands of man.

449
00:28:02,974 --> 00:28:06,577
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually will be using the Wi-Fi.

450
00:28:06,897 --> 00:28:11,801
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could actually, in theory, take it out and use it elsewhere.

451
00:28:12,561 --> 00:28:13,482
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a good idea.

452
00:28:13,742 --> 00:28:15,043
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a neat idea.

453
00:28:15,844 --> 00:28:19,126
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think I would do anything with it.

454
00:28:19,706 --> 00:28:21,488
[SPEAKER_00]: They should, though, have a similar device, though.

455
00:28:21,528 --> 00:28:22,869
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they could make a lot of money with that.

456
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:24,610
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

457
00:28:26,128 --> 00:28:31,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on, let's go over to Loki for some updates regarding Midway.

458
00:28:32,133 --> 00:28:34,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Some news on the newest Mortal Kombat, hopefully?

459
00:28:34,535 --> 00:28:34,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Midway.

460
00:28:35,675 --> 00:28:39,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Got some news actually for Midway, Namco, and Ubisoft, so it should be good.

461
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:42,621
[SPEAKER_03]: The first, of course, is coming from Midway's Gamer Day.

462
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:47,025
[SPEAKER_03]: I was unaware that everyone had their own Gamer Day, but I guess they do.

463
00:28:47,545 --> 00:28:51,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, some of the titles that they've announced, they're coming out this year.

464
00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:53,050
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one being...

465
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:54,171
[SPEAKER_03]: MLB Slugfest 2006

466
00:29:16,938 --> 00:29:20,341
[SPEAKER_03]: which is going to be actually a budget game coming out in about 20 bucks.

467
00:29:20,781 --> 00:29:23,022
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty cool for PlayStation 2 and Xbox.

468
00:29:23,923 --> 00:29:36,471
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, they have some info on the new Mortal Kombat Armageddon which is basically going to contain every single Mortal Kombat character in the Mortal Kombat universe plus a creative fighter and creative fatality mode.

469
00:29:37,172 --> 00:29:38,753
[SPEAKER_03]: It just looks really cool.

470
00:29:39,574 --> 00:29:57,645
[SPEAKER_03]: and then for your PSP fans they of course have Mortal Kombat Unchained or Mortal Kombat Deception Unchained which is kind of an update to the original Deception game of course with bonus characters including Katana, Jax, Frost, Blaze, Goro and Shao Kahn as well.

471
00:29:58,805 --> 00:29:59,626
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty sweet.

472
00:30:00,426 --> 00:30:07,531
[SPEAKER_03]: And then of course if you're an NBA fan NBA Ballers Phenom which also goes with NBA Ballers Rebound for the PSP.

473
00:30:07,651 --> 00:30:08,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Those kind of

474
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:10,390
[SPEAKER_03]: A different take on the basketball games.

475
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:13,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, you have to kind of become a star in a week.

476
00:30:13,631 --> 00:30:19,433
[SPEAKER_03]: So you get noticed by both sports agents and talent agents.

477
00:30:19,573 --> 00:30:24,335
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's kind of funny is they had one mini game in this that's kind of like DDR.

478
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:26,036
[SPEAKER_03]: You're dancing with mascots.

479
00:30:27,131 --> 00:30:27,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Rampage Total Destructions

480
00:30:47,373 --> 00:30:47,934
[SPEAKER_03]: on top of that.

481
00:30:47,974 --> 00:30:54,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, it includes the original Rampage game and Rampage World Tour that came out on PlayStation 2 a while back.

482
00:30:55,243 --> 00:30:57,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a big fan of any Rampage games since the original MSA.

483
00:30:57,486 --> 00:30:58,687
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also under $20.

484
00:31:02,032 --> 00:31:04,835
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're not a huge fan of it, at least it's not that expensive.

485
00:31:04,855 --> 00:31:06,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a rental.

486
00:31:06,952 --> 00:31:07,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

487
00:31:07,392 --> 00:31:14,799
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, their big title for this year is going to be The Spy Hunter, No Where to Run, of course, featuring The Rock and with the movie coming out.

488
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:15,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that risky?

489
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:20,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I don't see that movie doing very well, but of course, now that I said that, it'll probably be huge.

490
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:22,746
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a good action movie, put it that way.

491
00:31:22,967 --> 00:31:24,248
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Doom did pretty well.

492
00:31:24,888 --> 00:31:25,269
[SPEAKER_05]: It did?

493
00:31:25,829 --> 00:31:26,430
[SPEAKER_03]: It did okay.

494
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:27,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

495
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,111
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to do better.

496
00:31:28,131 --> 00:31:30,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it certainly did better than House of the Dead.

497
00:31:30,774 --> 00:31:32,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's leave it that way.

498
00:31:33,176 --> 00:31:33,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

499
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:33,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

500
00:31:34,954 --> 00:31:38,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Strangehold, a third-person kung fu cinematic game

501
00:31:51,304 --> 00:31:52,205
[SPEAKER_03]: which is kind of interesting.

502
00:31:52,665 --> 00:31:56,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, all done with Midway here, let's move on to Ubisoft.

503
00:31:56,589 --> 00:31:59,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Ubisoft is going to have a ton of stuff coming out in the Tom Clancy series.

504
00:32:00,612 --> 00:32:14,744
[SPEAKER_03]: First being Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas which is coming out on both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and The Revolution as well as PC and PSP and probably current gen stuff as well, I'm assuming.

505
00:32:15,745 --> 00:32:18,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon 4

506
00:32:20,263 --> 00:32:20,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Firehawk

507
00:32:33,823 --> 00:32:36,465
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never really heard of Firehawks, so that should be interesting.

508
00:32:37,045 --> 00:32:40,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Assassin, coming out also on all the next-gen systems.

509
00:32:41,288 --> 00:32:43,509
[SPEAKER_03]: One that I was really excited about, Luminous 2.

510
00:32:43,989 --> 00:32:46,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Hooray, me too, very excited.

511
00:32:46,051 --> 00:32:47,231
[SPEAKER_03]: PSP and PlayStation 2.

512
00:32:47,852 --> 00:32:49,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thank you.

513
00:32:49,753 --> 00:32:51,054
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty awesome.

514
00:32:51,994 --> 00:32:52,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Big kisses.

515
00:32:53,655 --> 00:32:55,156
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a couple other things.

516
00:32:55,556 --> 00:33:01,200
[SPEAKER_03]: There's Rayman 4 coming out on the next-gen systems and PlayStation 2 and handhelds.

517
00:33:02,177 --> 00:33:07,123
[SPEAKER_03]: and the new Might and Magic game, Dark Messiah of Might and Magic on the next-gen systems and PC.

518
00:33:08,524 --> 00:33:11,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Dear Luminous Creators, online versus K-Thanks.

519
00:33:13,804 --> 00:33:16,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally, Namco's lineup, which is pretty sweet.

520
00:33:16,685 --> 00:33:21,288
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got actually next month Ace Combat Zero coming out if you're an Ace Combat fan.

521
00:33:22,028 --> 00:33:24,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Me and my Katamari coming out later this year, which is pretty sweet.

522
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:30,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Snoopy and the Red Baron coming out fall of this year, which is going to be pretty cool.

523
00:33:30,572 --> 00:33:36,074
[SPEAKER_03]: The only next-gen game they had coming out this year is Frame City Killer, and that's been delayed numerous times.

524
00:33:36,194 --> 00:33:39,976
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's now slated for around July, which is interesting.

525
00:33:39,996 --> 00:33:41,337
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, Pac-Man fans...

526
00:33:42,247 --> 00:33:43,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Pac-Man World Rally Warhammer Mark of Chaos

527
00:34:04,685 --> 00:34:06,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots and lots of goodies coming out this year.

528
00:34:07,706 --> 00:34:13,008
[SPEAKER_05]: We're now in that period of the year, especially building up to E3, where we're going to hear a lot of flood of just game announcements.

529
00:34:13,408 --> 00:34:16,470
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got another one for you guys, and this is kind of a duh.

530
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:22,932
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we all knew this was coming, but Guitar Hero 2 has been for all purposes confirmed.

531
00:34:23,512 --> 00:34:30,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Kelly Sumner, who's the CEO of Red Octane, has said, We are working on Guitar Hero 2, which will have 40 plus new tracks.

532
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:31,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

533
00:34:31,095 --> 00:34:32,696
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a lot of us were waiting for that.

534
00:34:32,776 --> 00:34:33,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like it's going to be awesome.

535
00:34:33,816 --> 00:34:36,097
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's the part that's kind of interesting.

536
00:34:36,637 --> 00:34:45,921
[SPEAKER_05]: He also says that there's going to be genre spin-offs like country rock, metal edition, and possibly even doing a plug-and-play.

537
00:34:46,021 --> 00:34:47,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know how they have those joysticks?

538
00:34:47,401 --> 00:34:49,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what if you just bought a guitar?

539
00:34:49,122 --> 00:34:49,942
[SPEAKER_05]: No PlayStation needed.

540
00:34:50,262 --> 00:34:51,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Plug a guitar right into the TV.

541
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:57,745
[SPEAKER_05]: That worries me a little bit because now I'm going, uh-oh, is this too much of a good thing?

542
00:34:58,225 --> 00:34:59,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Can oversaturation destroy...

543
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:02,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Guitar Hero, what do you think?

544
00:35:03,452 --> 00:35:03,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

545
00:35:04,273 --> 00:35:05,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Depends on how they do it.

546
00:35:05,293 --> 00:35:14,601
[SPEAKER_03]: If they do it like, if it's exactly like Guitar Hero, you know, just as good, then maybe it might work, but no.

547
00:35:15,601 --> 00:35:16,442
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of worried about that.

548
00:35:16,622 --> 00:35:23,988
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of too bad for Red Octane that Guitar Hero wasn't an Xbox title because then they could be doing these expansions through live.

549
00:35:25,309 --> 00:35:25,509
[SPEAKER_05]: But,

550
00:35:26,926 --> 00:35:32,070
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess PlayStation 2 doesn't really allow that same type of thing, so I guess this is what they have to do.

551
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:39,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, have we ever really had games here that use the append idea like they did in Japan with some of the Beat Manias, where you have appendists?

552
00:35:39,635 --> 00:35:42,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's something that they can do, and this is kind of a brand new thing.

553
00:35:42,798 --> 00:35:45,220
[SPEAKER_03]: They did it with SOCOM, with downloadable maps.

554
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:51,945
[SPEAKER_03]: You pay a fee online, I believe it's $5, and you download the maps to a USB card.

555
00:35:52,455 --> 00:36:05,102
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you have a USB memory card or something like that, then you plug that into your PlayStation 2 and it unlocks the maps and it downloads to the hard drive type thing.

556
00:36:05,483 --> 00:36:09,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, that's a lot of factors that don't really bode well.

557
00:36:09,645 --> 00:36:11,926
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the PS2 Slim doesn't have a hard drive.

558
00:36:12,467 --> 00:36:14,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everyone has a USB memory stick.

559
00:36:14,728 --> 00:36:18,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everyone's willing to pay for this and download it off the internet type thing.

560
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,111
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

561
00:36:21,068 --> 00:36:28,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Comments from the chatroom, www.orangeloungeradio.com We have Wolfwind Shadow says, do an 80s version on Guitar Hero.

562
00:36:28,756 --> 00:36:29,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Winner.

563
00:36:29,557 --> 00:36:31,959
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be like hair rock power ballads.

564
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,561
[SPEAKER_05]: This guy just won the internet.

565
00:36:33,581 --> 00:36:34,281
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great idea.

566
00:36:34,822 --> 00:36:37,164
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to see early 90s music as well, though.

567
00:36:37,244 --> 00:36:40,948
[SPEAKER_05]: I want my Nelson, my Poison, my damn Yankees.

568
00:36:41,248 --> 00:36:42,630
[SPEAKER_00]: Motley Crue, Tesla.

569
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,082
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be awesome.

570
00:36:45,783 --> 00:36:46,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just do Guitar Hero.

571
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:51,410
[SPEAKER_00]: I just need Guitar Hero Ted Nugent for Guitar Hero Queen.

572
00:36:52,471 --> 00:36:52,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Heck yeah.

573
00:36:53,152 --> 00:36:53,853
[SPEAKER_05]: All Queen.

574
00:36:54,094 --> 00:36:59,320
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they have one Queen song in the... No, we need a Guitar Hero J-Rock version to go out in Japan.

575
00:37:00,141 --> 00:37:01,243
[SPEAKER_00]: Think we'll ever see Guitar Freaks?

576
00:37:01,954 --> 00:37:02,995
[SPEAKER_00]: DDR Supernova

577
00:37:23,877 --> 00:37:26,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, now they're doing location testing in Japan.

578
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:34,425
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot more songs have been added to the location test, including some of our old favorites here.

579
00:37:34,465 --> 00:37:40,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Our new Captain Jack, Centerfold, the 130 BPM Move It remix, which is interesting.

580
00:37:41,611 --> 00:37:44,874
[SPEAKER_03]: They also feature some Doesn't Really Matter by Janet Jackson.

581
00:37:46,315 --> 00:37:46,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see here.

582
00:37:47,396 --> 00:37:51,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Kaimano, Love at First Sight, Twin Master Plan Mix.

583
00:37:52,809 --> 00:37:54,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Some pretty big names there, Janet and Kylie.

584
00:37:55,171 --> 00:37:58,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Wookiee Wookiee by Macho Man.

585
00:37:59,274 --> 00:38:02,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and for every big name there's got to be a what the F is this, alright?

586
00:38:02,757 --> 00:38:03,438
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that was funny.

587
00:38:04,839 --> 00:38:08,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it De Capo by Ace of Base?

588
00:38:10,323 --> 00:38:11,284
[SPEAKER_05]: De Capo, I think it is.

589
00:38:11,304 --> 00:38:12,185
[SPEAKER_03]: De Capo, I'm sorry.

590
00:38:12,265 --> 00:38:12,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

591
00:38:13,185 --> 00:38:14,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Golden Sky by SmileDK.

592
00:38:14,226 --> 00:38:14,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

593
00:38:16,297 --> 00:38:19,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Return of Small Decay My Only Shining Star by Naoki featuring Becky Lucinda

594
00:38:40,769 --> 00:38:43,031
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

595
00:39:08,976 --> 00:39:15,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Shouting the lyrics to the song, and it's exactly like your D2R, really for you type things.

596
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:17,981
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't like it.

597
00:39:18,241 --> 00:39:20,702
[SPEAKER_03]: I listened to the song once, and I'm like, no.

598
00:39:21,262 --> 00:39:23,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Naoki fans will be fine with it.

599
00:39:23,763 --> 00:39:26,525
[SPEAKER_03]: It's exactly 1998 or anything like that.

600
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:30,607
[SPEAKER_03]: If you like that superhero beat stuff, great.

601
00:39:31,633 --> 00:39:33,595
[SPEAKER_03]: D to the A to the N to the C

602
00:39:58,317 --> 00:39:59,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Extra Stages are kind of interesting.

603
00:40:00,318 --> 00:40:09,045
[SPEAKER_03]: On top of Fascination Max, they also have Healing D-Vision by D-Stard, which is interesting.

604
00:40:09,545 --> 00:40:12,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Which I'm sure is just another Naoki pseudonym, honestly.

605
00:40:12,727 --> 00:40:16,450
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the one more Extra Stage is Chaos by Desire Returns.

606
00:40:17,451 --> 00:40:23,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that'll make people happy, because Desire did Trip Machine, and I think it was a big Healing Vision and all that stuff, right?

607
00:40:23,995 --> 00:40:24,335
[SPEAKER_05]: So that'll be fun.

608
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:24,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

609
00:40:25,976 --> 00:40:30,461
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm happy to hear a new Healing Vision song and Chaos sounds good.

610
00:40:32,492 --> 00:40:34,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Fascination Max sucks so bad.

611
00:40:34,213 --> 00:40:35,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

612
00:40:35,253 --> 00:40:36,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, at least they're giving you options now.

613
00:40:36,974 --> 00:40:37,934
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to play that one.

614
00:40:38,034 --> 00:40:39,575
[SPEAKER_03]: But it sucks so bad.

615
00:40:39,695 --> 00:40:43,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, I thought that was interesting.

616
00:40:43,376 --> 00:40:48,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we know that we have a lot of fans out there who grew up with us on the music games, but of course we talk about all the games.

617
00:40:48,978 --> 00:40:52,700
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to open up the floor right now for your feedback, and you can give us a call.

618
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,741

[SPEAKER_04]: Carissa Gregory Okay, why?

626
00:41:34,904 --> 00:41:46,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, because I hope she's listening in because like I referred her to the show here and I just hope she's listening in Is this a special friend?

627
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:50,492
[SPEAKER_04]: No, just a friend in general Okay, just, you know, I had to check

628
00:41:51,049 --> 00:41:51,950
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

629
00:42:16,752 --> 00:42:19,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you guys are talking about, like, cars with guns and things like that.

630
00:42:19,374 --> 00:42:19,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh.

631
00:42:20,415 --> 00:42:24,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, if you want a game with cars with guns, like, play Battle Mode and Rush 2049.

632
00:42:26,521 --> 00:42:28,062
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't played it, maybe.

633
00:42:28,102 --> 00:42:31,305
[SPEAKER_05]: What makes this game so great compared to Burnout and Full Auto and all that stuff?

634
00:42:31,986 --> 00:42:38,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, think Mario Kart Battle Mode, except you actually have guns mounted on top of your cars, and you literally are shooting each other and blowing each other up.

635
00:42:38,992 --> 00:42:40,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that sounds like Full Auto to me.

636
00:42:41,641 --> 00:42:41,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

637
00:42:42,261 --> 00:42:45,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Full Auto's pretty much the same thing, except you get mines and all that fun stuff, too.

638
00:42:45,382 --> 00:42:46,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, he's saying Rush 2049?

639
00:42:46,702 --> 00:42:47,942
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought they didn't have guns in it.

640
00:42:48,222 --> 00:42:49,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, he said Battle Edition.

641
00:42:49,882 --> 00:42:50,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

642
00:42:50,483 --> 00:42:51,103
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Battle Mode.

643
00:42:51,363 --> 00:42:51,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Battle Mode.

644
00:42:52,823 --> 00:42:54,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Same game, just different mode.

645
00:42:54,743 --> 00:42:59,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, obviously, this is a very popular genre of games, as cars with guns and destruction is fun.

646
00:43:00,464 --> 00:43:10,326
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm all for it, because honestly, if I can take out my aggressions on the Xbox and I don't do it for real when I see those old ladies driving the SUVs that can't stay in one lane and all that fun stuff...

647
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:11,880
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

648
00:43:35,785 --> 00:43:36,908
[SPEAKER_05]: You're so awful!

649
00:43:37,549 --> 00:43:38,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, just messing.

650
00:43:38,832 --> 00:43:42,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo Maniac, any other feedback, hellos you want to say before we let you go?

651
00:43:44,685 --> 00:43:45,807
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not really sure if my MP...

652
00:43:51,735 --> 00:43:54,776
[SPEAKER_05]: MP3 Pro will only work in Winamp, it doesn't work in iTunes, unfortunately.

653
00:43:54,876 --> 00:43:58,977
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I'm using Winamp.

654
00:44:00,818 --> 00:44:05,680
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not going to hear too much of a difference this time at the 64K, it's really good either way.

655
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:11,042
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you have it installed and you have it selected and ready to go, you should be set.

656
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:12,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

657
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, have a good one.

658
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:14,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I have one last question?

659
00:44:14,711 --> 00:44:14,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

660
00:44:15,651 --> 00:44:18,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, does it affect regular MP3s too?

661
00:44:19,412 --> 00:44:22,873
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not unless you purposely save your MP3s as MP3 Pro.

662
00:44:22,953 --> 00:44:29,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Some programs like Adobe Audition will allow you to encode an MP3 Pro right away, but you're probably not going to notice much of a difference.

663
00:44:30,056 --> 00:44:30,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

664
00:44:30,516 --> 00:44:30,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

665
00:44:32,016 --> 00:44:32,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one, buddy.

666
00:44:32,997 --> 00:44:33,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for calling.

667
00:44:34,817 --> 00:44:38,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's go to another call here on the Skype line.

668
00:44:38,938 --> 00:44:40,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

669
00:44:41,735 --> 00:44:42,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello!

670
00:44:42,456 --> 00:44:43,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, who's this?

671
00:44:43,756 --> 00:44:44,837
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Wolf Windshadow.

672
00:44:44,977 --> 00:44:45,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, Wolf Windshadow!

673
00:44:46,018 --> 00:44:47,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you're the one that wanted the 80s Guitar Hero.

674
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, I grew up in the 80s.

675
00:44:51,462 --> 00:44:55,145
[SPEAKER_05]: We did, too, and we were just talking about how old we feel tonight, but that's all right.

676
00:44:55,485 --> 00:44:56,005
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

677
00:44:56,086 --> 00:45:00,569
[SPEAKER_05]: We need an old-school Aerosmith loving an elevator.

678
00:45:00,649 --> 00:45:02,030
[SPEAKER_05]: How fun would that be on Guitar Hero?

679
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:04,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what's on your mind tonight?

680
00:45:06,133 --> 00:45:07,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, not too much.

681
00:45:07,394 --> 00:45:10,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Just run into your show for the first time.

682
00:45:10,879 --> 00:45:11,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome, how'd you find us?

683
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:17,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just randomly searching for places that use Skype.

684
00:45:18,403 --> 00:45:18,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.

685
00:45:19,244 --> 00:45:19,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's cool.

686
00:45:20,164 --> 00:45:20,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

687
00:45:20,625 --> 00:45:21,705
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty unique.

688
00:45:21,845 --> 00:45:39,496
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm going to say, we were, and I'm going to make a claim here, and somebody will probably dispute that, but we were honestly one of the first online radio stations to back Skype instead of a Skype line, because we've been doing Skype for a long, long time, and now it's really catching on, but, you know, we're happy to have pioneered the Skype line thing.

689
00:45:40,876 --> 00:45:42,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I'm a computer consultant.

690
00:45:42,837 --> 00:45:44,797
[SPEAKER_02]: I have it up on my website.

691
00:45:45,257 --> 00:45:45,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

692
00:45:45,817 --> 00:45:46,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you sound great.

693
00:45:46,698 --> 00:45:50,919
[SPEAKER_05]: I should have guessed you were a former Skype user because sometimes we have first-timers on Skype that don't sound so great.

694
00:45:51,259 --> 00:45:55,260
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're really glad that we got random people connecting to our show.

695
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,100
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind of games have you been playing this week?

696
00:45:58,781 --> 00:46:00,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, not too many this week.

697
00:46:00,321 --> 00:46:05,702
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting ready to go back to school and finish up my degree.

698
00:46:05,842 --> 00:46:08,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Real life's got to come first sometimes, right, DarkSakura?

699
00:46:08,063 --> 00:46:08,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

700
00:46:09,232 --> 00:46:09,953
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, yes.

701
00:46:10,974 --> 00:46:13,736
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you have to cut classes how to accommodate life.

702
00:46:13,856 --> 00:46:17,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well, if you didn't have to be going back to school, what game would you be checking out right now?

703
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I'd be checking out some of the games with cars and guns.

704
00:46:21,543 --> 00:46:22,063
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

705
00:46:22,924 --> 00:46:25,106
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a big thing right now.

706
00:46:25,306 --> 00:46:27,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you a burnout man or a full auto man?

707
00:46:28,829 --> 00:46:29,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Full auto.

708
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:30,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Any particular reason why?

709
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:34,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really, just interesting.

710
00:46:34,274 --> 00:46:36,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you actually get guns on your car in full auto, huh?

711
00:46:37,516 --> 00:46:38,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably something like that.

712
00:46:38,677 --> 00:46:41,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Wolf, Wind, Shadow, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

713
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, not tonight.

714
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:44,361
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually enjoying the show.

715
00:46:44,602 --> 00:46:45,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

716
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:45,843
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate it.

717
00:46:45,883 --> 00:46:46,883
[SPEAKER_05]: We love getting new listeners.

718
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:48,625
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, tell a friend.

719
00:46:48,645 --> 00:46:50,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Help support independent online radio.

720
00:46:51,027 --> 00:46:51,387
[SPEAKER_05]: We love it.

721
00:46:51,627 --> 00:46:52,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Give us money.

722
00:46:52,107 --> 00:46:52,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

723
00:46:53,208 --> 00:46:54,349
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not asking for money yet.

724
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:56,090
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

725
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:57,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks so much, Wolf, Wind, Shadow, for tuning in.

726
00:46:57,892 --> 00:46:58,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care.

727
00:46:58,372 --> 00:46:58,993
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

728
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:01,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Write Red Octane and tell them your idea for the 80s Guitar Hero.

729
00:47:02,115 --> 00:47:02,796
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it should happen.

730
00:47:03,736 --> 00:47:04,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

731
00:47:04,237 --> 00:47:04,537
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

732
00:47:05,037 --> 00:47:05,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care, buddy.

733
00:47:05,558 --> 00:47:05,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one.

734
00:47:08,021 --> 00:47:10,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's go to another call here.

735
00:47:10,402 --> 00:47:12,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go, we'll pick up this line.

736
00:47:13,084 --> 00:47:14,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

737
00:47:16,866 --> 00:47:20,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, turn down your speakers because we're hearing ourselves pretty bad.

738
00:47:21,069 --> 00:47:22,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

739
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:24,250
[SPEAKER_05]: We got time.

740
00:47:25,691 --> 00:47:26,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, what's on your mind?

741
00:47:28,293 --> 00:47:28,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it good now?

742
00:47:29,393 --> 00:47:30,014
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're okay.

743
00:47:30,054 --> 00:47:30,534
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on your mind?

744
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:37,178
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, I kind of joined in a bit late, but I heard Loki talking about a song that he just hated.

745
00:47:37,523 --> 00:47:38,223
[SPEAKER_01]: What song was that?

746
00:47:38,383 --> 00:47:40,164
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know it's on the new mix.

747
00:47:40,285 --> 00:47:41,485
[SPEAKER_01]: What song was he talking about?

748
00:47:41,645 --> 00:47:43,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Fascination Max, right, Loki?

749
00:47:45,027 --> 00:47:47,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you just trying to get me to hate you?

750
00:47:47,108 --> 00:47:48,229
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm a Mac user.

751
00:47:48,409 --> 00:47:49,650
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Fascination Max.

752
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:50,930
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you just trying to get me to hate you?

753
00:47:52,671 --> 00:47:54,732
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a Mac user and he loves Fascination Max.

754
00:47:54,752 --> 00:47:56,213
[SPEAKER_05]: He's just the anti-Loki.

755
00:47:57,014 --> 00:47:59,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Got bad taste in music and computing.

756
00:48:02,485 --> 00:48:07,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I can tell you right now that Loki does not blow up in the presence of Max because there's one pointing directly at him.

757
00:48:09,609 --> 00:48:11,870
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one redeeming quality, the PSP homebrew.

758
00:48:12,351 --> 00:48:12,791
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.

759
00:48:13,792 --> 00:48:16,813
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, diversity makes the world go round, my friend.

760
00:48:16,873 --> 00:48:18,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes we're just going to have to agree to disagree.

761
00:48:19,435 --> 00:48:22,537
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when Loki goes to hell, it's going to be like an Apple store.

762
00:48:25,399 --> 00:48:26,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Flat panel iMacs everywhere.

763
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:27,420
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

764
00:48:28,317 --> 00:48:29,198
[SPEAKER_05]: I just thought of this.

765
00:48:29,238 --> 00:48:32,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think they're going to have a dedication to Captain Jack on Supernova?

766
00:48:58,979 --> 00:48:59,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Ray Charles?

767
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:28,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, there you go.

768
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:33,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Ray Charles is in DDR and there was no real... Wait, Ray Charles?

769
00:49:33,144 --> 00:49:33,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Is he still alive?

770
00:49:33,945 --> 00:49:34,165
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

771
00:49:34,786 --> 00:49:36,527
[SPEAKER_05]: He died last year.

772
00:49:37,488 --> 00:49:39,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you see how much I follow the entertainment news?

773
00:49:41,132 --> 00:49:43,033
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ, really, only time will tell.

774
00:49:43,054 --> 00:49:44,014
[SPEAKER_05]: 17 years of this crap.

775
00:49:44,755 --> 00:49:45,296
[SPEAKER_05]: No idea.

776
00:49:45,536 --> 00:49:45,936
[SPEAKER_05]: No idea.

777
00:49:46,297 --> 00:49:47,037
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be nice.

778
00:49:47,498 --> 00:49:49,199
[SPEAKER_05]: What would you do if you were Konami?

779
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:51,762
[SPEAKER_05]: How would you pay your respects to Captain Jack, who passed away last year?

780
00:49:52,452 --> 00:50:01,283
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, probably have a little picture before the pre-game animation saying, this is dedicated to Captain Jack.

781
00:50:01,463 --> 00:50:02,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of like Burnout Revenge.

782
00:50:03,288 --> 00:50:03,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Did they have that?

783
00:50:03,788 --> 00:50:04,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like that.

784
00:50:04,849 --> 00:50:05,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I haven't seen it.

785
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:06,010
[SPEAKER_07]: You haven't seen it?

786
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:06,351
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

787
00:50:06,811 --> 00:50:08,412
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know who the hell it is, though.

788
00:50:08,913 --> 00:50:09,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

789
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:09,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Who is that?

790
00:50:10,214 --> 00:50:11,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Some guy, I don't know.

791
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:11,956
[SPEAKER_00]: Some doctor.

792
00:50:12,096 --> 00:50:16,099
[SPEAKER_00]: They can show his picture and do R.I.P., you know, birth date, death date.

793
00:50:16,199 --> 00:50:22,365
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if they did something really lovely with the background, I think that would be appropriate, so when people played the song, they could, you know, why are you laughing?

794
00:50:22,525 --> 00:50:26,628
[SPEAKER_07]: They do it like Pixar, where Pixar, at the end of the credits, has babies that were born during the production of the film.

795
00:50:31,411 --> 00:50:33,232
[SPEAKER_07]: They could have people that have died in the production of the game.

796
00:50:35,572 --> 00:50:38,793
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really morbid, but... They could put, you know, Captain Jack, my soul.

797
00:50:40,414 --> 00:50:42,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, SSJ100, Matt, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

798
00:50:42,994 --> 00:50:43,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Our profit margins?

799
00:50:45,955 --> 00:50:46,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Roxer?

800
00:50:47,296 --> 00:50:47,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing really.

801
00:50:48,216 --> 00:50:53,518
[SPEAKER_06]: I managed to actually get a sneak peek of a video game movie that's coming out soon.

802
00:50:53,618 --> 00:50:54,058
[SPEAKER_06]: What's this?

803
00:50:55,378 --> 00:50:56,659
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Staying Alive.

804
00:50:57,319 --> 00:50:57,919
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's it about?

805
00:50:59,037 --> 00:51:01,118
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that movie with John Travolta, was it?

806
00:51:01,138 --> 00:51:03,838
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not Staying Alive, it's called... Stay Alive.

807
00:51:04,158 --> 00:51:04,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Stay Alive.

808
00:51:05,018 --> 00:51:10,080
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the one where the kids play the game and when they die in the game, they die in real life.

809
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:10,600
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw a trailer.

810
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:12,940
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not necessarily a video game movie.

811
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:18,462
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more of a really crappy movie that they based around... It's capitalizing on the violent game culture.

812
00:51:19,182 --> 00:51:19,802
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what it is?

813
00:51:20,002 --> 00:51:20,802
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you think?

814
00:51:21,062 --> 00:51:21,542
[SPEAKER_05]: You saw it.

815
00:51:21,562 --> 00:51:22,023
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you think?

816
00:51:22,563 --> 00:51:23,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, actually, no, I didn't really...

817
00:51:25,486 --> 00:51:26,166
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't really see it.

818
00:51:26,246 --> 00:51:27,507
[SPEAKER_06]: It was at an old school.

819
00:51:27,527 --> 00:51:31,268
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to visit it and I visited the video game section.

820
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:38,731
[SPEAKER_06]: They were giving them sneak peeks of the gameplay in the movie.

821
00:51:38,951 --> 00:51:43,652
[SPEAKER_06]: The movie itself looks like Nightmare on Elm Street meets Ring.

822
00:51:45,313 --> 00:51:46,973
[SPEAKER_06]: If you die in the game, you die in real life.

823
00:51:47,734 --> 00:51:51,655
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nonsense like that.

824
00:51:51,755 --> 00:51:54,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it something that you will probably want to see?

825
00:51:55,256 --> 00:51:55,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably not.

826
00:51:57,097 --> 00:51:58,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that kid from Malcolm in the Middle in it?

827
00:52:00,859 --> 00:52:02,540
[SPEAKER_06]: No, actually, I don't know.

828
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:05,081
[SPEAKER_06]: But the guy from... I think he is.

829
00:52:06,382 --> 00:52:10,404
[SPEAKER_06]: The guy who was in Hebrew Hammer, I'm not sure if anyone knows that.

830
00:52:10,424 --> 00:52:11,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Adam Goldberg.

831
00:52:11,785 --> 00:52:12,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Goldberg.

832
00:52:12,285 --> 00:52:13,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn, you beat me to it.

833
00:52:14,726 --> 00:52:15,887
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just that good, Bugged.

834
00:52:16,027 --> 00:52:17,227
[SPEAKER_05]: You should know after 17 years.

835
00:52:18,528 --> 00:52:23,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but I saw in the trailer, this shouldn't be much of a spoiler because you see it in the trailer, he dies, which means his role isn't that big.

836
00:52:25,325 --> 00:52:26,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, obviously not.

837
00:52:27,426 --> 00:52:29,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well we'll see when the movie comes out.

838
00:52:29,287 --> 00:52:30,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Much like Scream.

839
00:52:30,228 --> 00:52:31,729
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have an OLR at the movie day.

840
00:52:32,209 --> 00:52:34,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, SSJ1Hermat, thank you so much for calling.

841
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:35,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate it as always, bud.

842
00:52:36,051 --> 00:52:36,251
[SPEAKER_05]: You too.

843
00:52:37,935 --> 00:52:38,375
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura DarkSakura

844
00:53:01,778 --> 00:53:10,346
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope, there's going to be no online mode for Virtua Fighter, which actually I don't really care about Virtua Fighter, but I just thought it was pretty funny that they were even trying.

845
00:53:10,787 --> 00:53:13,089
[SPEAKER_00]: Hiroshi Kataoka, who was the...

846
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:25,522
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess big guy behind Virtua Fighter told EGM basically that they tried to do it online by simulating lag and timing and that it wasn't really going to do that.

847
00:53:25,562 --> 00:53:27,242
[SPEAKER_00]: It changed the gameplay way too much.

848
00:53:28,082 --> 00:53:32,664
[SPEAKER_00]: To quote, if we ever wanted to do an online fighting game, it would have to be something besides Virtua Fighter.

849
00:53:33,284 --> 00:53:38,886
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe that's a hint at something else, but for right now, no online mode.

850
00:53:39,646 --> 00:53:39,766
[SPEAKER_00]: Awww.

851
00:53:41,463 --> 00:53:45,184
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know many people that are Virtua Fighter fans above all else.

852
00:53:45,765 --> 00:53:51,287
[SPEAKER_05]: I know people that like Virtua Fighter, but they also like Dead or Alive or something.

853
00:53:51,347 --> 00:53:52,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Mortal Kombat.

854
00:53:52,807 --> 00:53:57,609
[SPEAKER_00]: I know plenty of people who are diehard Virtua Fighter fans who have been since day one.

855
00:53:58,349 --> 00:54:02,671
[SPEAKER_00]: My bias against Virtua Fighter starts from day one because the game gave me massive headaches.

856
00:54:03,647 --> 00:54:07,329
[SPEAKER_00]: and so I just never got into playing it too much and then I found my love for Tekken.

857
00:54:07,529 --> 00:54:10,950
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, can you actually be a fan of both Virtua Fighter and Tekken?

858
00:54:10,970 --> 00:54:11,470
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure.

859
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:12,651
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm sure you could.

860
00:54:12,671 --> 00:54:18,093
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm not, but anyone can, it just depends on what you like.

861
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:20,694
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see why you have to hate one thing to like the other.

862
00:54:20,714 --> 00:54:24,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, wasn't Virtua Fighter kind of the response to Tekken?

863
00:54:26,016 --> 00:54:29,358
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, Virtua Fighter was out, if I do recall, before Tekken.

864
00:54:29,478 --> 00:54:30,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, I don't know.

865
00:54:30,178 --> 00:54:30,538
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

866
00:54:31,087 --> 00:54:31,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Virtua Fighter 32X

867
00:54:58,686 --> 00:54:58,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

868
00:54:59,126 --> 00:55:00,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I think it was.

869
00:55:00,127 --> 00:55:03,868
[SPEAKER_00]: Virtua Racing had the humongous Genesis cartridge.

870
00:55:04,388 --> 00:55:07,009
[SPEAKER_00]: No, Virtua Fighter was on Genesis, if I do recall.

871
00:55:07,649 --> 00:55:08,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

872
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:10,450
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me do a quick bit of research.

873
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:12,511
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was either on Genesis or 32X.

874
00:55:12,611 --> 00:55:15,252
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they put out a crap version on Genesis is what it is.

875
00:55:15,272 --> 00:55:16,153
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was really awful.

876
00:55:16,273 --> 00:55:16,933
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was really awful.

877
00:55:16,953 --> 00:55:20,074
[SPEAKER_00]: And Tekken didn't make it to the home until PlayStation was out.

878
00:55:20,094 --> 00:55:23,515
[SPEAKER_07]: So it still has a promo pack for my Saturn that has Virtua Fighter 2?

879
00:55:23,675 --> 00:55:28,057
[SPEAKER_00]: Virtua Fighter 2 was one of the pack-in games.

880
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:32,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, with Daytona and something else I forgot that I don't play.

881
00:55:32,111 --> 00:55:32,431
[SPEAKER_00]: Christmas Nights?

882
00:55:32,591 --> 00:55:34,752
[SPEAKER_00]: No, Christmas Nights was a mail-in thing.

883
00:55:35,492 --> 00:55:42,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Dark Knight in our chatroom says, Saturn first, then 32X, then Genesis, but they're kind of going back and forth a little bit.

884
00:55:42,294 --> 00:55:44,514
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because the 32X version was out before the Saturn was out.

885
00:55:44,614 --> 00:55:49,016
[SPEAKER_05]: They're trying to figure it out right now in chat, so, I mean, honestly, it's not a big deal.

886
00:55:49,296 --> 00:55:51,356
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because I had a 32X.

887
00:55:51,656 --> 00:55:55,918
[SPEAKER_00]: No, well, I would trade back and forth my Nintendo and 32X with somebody, and he had Virtual Fighter on 32X.

888
00:55:55,938 --> 00:55:55,998
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.

889
00:55:57,628 --> 00:56:04,611
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I have the game now on 32X, but... Zaku in our chatroom, Legend of Zaku, says 32X is the worst add-on ever.

890
00:56:04,651 --> 00:56:05,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you agree?

891
00:56:05,851 --> 00:56:10,052
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because of Knuckles Chaotix and Calibri.

892
00:56:10,092 --> 00:56:13,054
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you can play Knuckles Chaotix on a GameTap, I want to say.

893
00:56:13,854 --> 00:56:25,318
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Knuckles Chaotix, because who remembers... If anyone is into emulation, there was a game called Sonic Crackers, which, from what I understand, was the template for what Knuckles Chaotix became.

894
00:56:25,748 --> 00:56:28,270
[SPEAKER_00]: Colibri was a really cool game we played as a little hummingbird.

895
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:30,031
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I played that.

896
00:56:30,051 --> 00:56:39,977
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best home version of Space Harrier, apart from the re-releases, was on 32X and Afterburner.

897
00:56:40,858 --> 00:56:42,259
[SPEAKER_05]: I played Colibri on GameTap.

898
00:56:42,279 --> 00:56:43,400
[SPEAKER_05]: It made no sense to me at all.

899
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:45,321
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a freaky little weird game, but it's cool.

900
00:56:46,061 --> 00:56:50,224
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, the best versions of Space Harrier and Afterburner were on 32X.

901
00:56:51,165 --> 00:56:51,405
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

902
00:56:52,488 --> 00:56:54,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on to another topic.

903
00:56:54,149 --> 00:56:56,050
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to talk about the Xbox 360.

904
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:57,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on to a new platform.

905
00:56:58,711 --> 00:57:05,675
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have a 360 but somehow haven't bought Xbox Live Gold, you're going to get your chance to sample what it's all about.

906
00:57:05,735 --> 00:57:08,677
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming up at the end of the month, March 31st through April 2nd.

907
00:57:09,777 --> 00:57:13,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Only in the US though, sorry listeners in UK, Japan, etc.

908
00:57:14,179 --> 00:57:16,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Verizon is going to be sponsoring this.

909
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:23,523
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to be giving Xbox Live Gold to everybody for the weekend and also giving away 1 million points.

910
00:57:23,863 --> 00:57:28,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Not all at once, but you can collect your 500 free Microsoft points.

911
00:57:28,985 --> 00:57:29,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Not sure how.

912
00:57:30,186 --> 00:57:35,488
[SPEAKER_05]: I imagine it's going to involve selling your soul to Verizon in one way or another, but we'll see.

913
00:57:35,628 --> 00:57:36,589
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an April Fool's joke.

914
00:57:36,629 --> 00:57:37,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at the dates.

915
00:57:37,771 --> 00:57:38,912
[SPEAKER_05]: March 31st to April 2nd.

916
00:57:38,952 --> 00:57:39,732
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't know.

917
00:57:39,792 --> 00:57:40,272
[SPEAKER_07]: It's right in the middle.

918
00:57:40,572 --> 00:57:42,493
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're advertising it on Xbox Live right now.

919
00:57:42,533 --> 00:57:44,254
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't think it's an April Fool's joke.

920
00:57:44,354 --> 00:57:44,774
[SPEAKER_07]: The points are.

921
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:45,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

922
00:57:45,655 --> 00:57:47,515
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're also going to have some tournaments.

923
00:57:47,575 --> 00:57:49,976
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know one of them was for Geometry Wars, which I think is kind of neat.

924
00:57:50,157 --> 00:57:51,117
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's pretty cool.

925
00:57:52,134 --> 00:57:52,994
[SPEAKER_05]: It's interesting.

926
00:57:53,034 --> 00:57:58,899
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, sure, it's corporate, but it's nice to see something different happening and some little promotions going on.

927
00:57:58,939 --> 00:57:59,620
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's kind of cool.

928
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:06,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, if you happen to purchase a copy of Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, you get 48 hours of free Xbox Live Gold.

929
00:58:06,405 --> 00:58:07,646
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a card in there, too.

930
00:58:08,066 --> 00:58:14,812
[SPEAKER_03]: But most likely, if you bought that game, you probably already have Xbox Live Gold anyways, because it's

931
00:58:15,194 --> 00:58:16,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Virtua Fighter Saturn, June 95, Virtua Fighter 32X, November 95

932
00:58:36,511 --> 00:58:37,451
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll settle this right now.

933
00:58:37,471 --> 00:58:38,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Street Fighter is greater than everything.

934
00:59:06,869 --> 00:59:07,850
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

935
00:59:29,224 --> 00:59:30,605
[SPEAKER_03]: What's Nintendo cooking up, Loki?

936
00:59:30,805 --> 00:59:33,366
[SPEAKER_03]: They're cooking up a new game here for the revolution, and this is actually a

937
00:59:53,868 --> 00:59:54,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

938
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:09,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

939
01:00:09,851 --> 01:00:11,192
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the good kind of scare for me.

940
01:00:11,593 --> 01:00:17,218
[SPEAKER_03]: So kind of like, you know, think Silent Hill to an extent, you know, because I know Silent Hill is pretty bloody.

941
01:00:17,278 --> 01:00:22,303
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, definitely things like, for example, they'll use the Revolution Controller.

942
01:00:22,363 --> 01:00:27,008
[SPEAKER_03]: You can use it as a torch to scare away rats or to slit the throat of...

943
01:00:27,489 --> 01:00:28,530
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not gory at all

944
01:00:48,416 --> 01:00:49,817
[SPEAKER_03]: That actually was done.

945
01:01:16,943 --> 01:01:17,544
[SPEAKER_00]: Eternal Darkness

946
01:01:28,854 --> 01:01:29,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Mario Parties

947
01:01:57,056 --> 01:02:01,740
[SPEAKER_03]: There's really not anything killer coming out for the GameCube.

948
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:06,705
[SPEAKER_03]: The only other thing lined up for it is the next Zelda Twilight Princess.

949
01:02:06,985 --> 01:02:07,545
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

950
01:02:08,646 --> 01:02:09,107
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

951
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:10,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get me wrong.

952
01:02:10,408 --> 01:02:15,512
[SPEAKER_05]: I love me some Nintendo, but I think the GameCube is slowly fading to black, which is sad.

953
01:02:17,205 --> 01:02:20,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, let's go on to another story.

954
01:02:20,746 --> 01:02:26,688
[SPEAKER_05]: If you play one too many of these survival horror games, you might just start going crazy and have to go into a recovery program.

955
01:02:27,248 --> 01:02:32,350
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, the gaming industry, there's been a suggestion on the internet lately for a recovery program of its own.

956
01:02:32,370 --> 01:02:33,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct, DarkSakura?

957
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:41,993
[SPEAKER_00]: There was actually, I brought up a 12-step self-esteem recovery program at the game marketing conference.

958
01:02:42,355 --> 01:02:44,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Now this isn't for gamers though, it's for the gaming industry.

959
01:02:44,796 --> 01:02:46,197
[SPEAKER_00]: The gaming industry, exactly.

960
01:02:46,217 --> 01:02:49,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the gaming industry has been kind of one-two punched by the government a lot lately.

961
01:02:50,039 --> 01:02:53,321
[SPEAKER_00]: So number one, promote the rating system.

962
01:02:53,801 --> 01:03:00,085
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, there's a good rating system by the ESRB, so make sure people know how it works.

963
01:03:00,525 --> 01:03:02,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Well deserving of being the number one spot.

964
01:03:03,086 --> 01:03:05,968
[SPEAKER_00]: Two, evangelize the benefits of video games.

965
01:03:07,769 --> 01:03:10,951
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it actually references a book, Everything Bad is Good for You.

966
01:03:11,818 --> 01:03:15,787
[SPEAKER_05]: But mom, it helps my hand-eye coordination!

967
01:03:23,678 --> 01:03:24,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Vaguely.

968
01:03:25,099 --> 01:03:41,047
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, just to go ahead and read this out, video games involve data pattern recognition and tracking multiple characters and multiple storylines, sustained concentration, complex problem solving, they're interactive, they're not passive like music or reading, there's more open-ended gameplay.

969
01:03:42,768 --> 01:03:52,954
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, especially with puzzle games, that article that I had brought up last year was saying how those who played more video games had overall better problem solving skills than non-gamers.

970
01:03:53,484 --> 01:03:54,404
[SPEAKER_00]: out of their control group.

971
01:03:56,225 --> 01:04:03,888
[SPEAKER_00]: Number three, do more quantitative research with leading universities to prove the positive impact of video gaming and qualify any negatives.

972
01:04:04,148 --> 01:04:05,829
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to share the good and the bad.

973
01:04:07,763 --> 01:04:11,226
[SPEAKER_00]: 4.

974
01:04:07,823 --> 01:04:11,226
[SPEAKER_00]: Publicize that history shows we never embrace new media.

975
01:04:13,569 --> 01:04:18,634
[SPEAKER_00]: This is true for silent movies, radio, pulp magazines, comic books, and every new music wave, including Mozart.

976
01:04:18,994 --> 01:04:23,338
[SPEAKER_00]: Video games are not the devil incarnate and not capable of half the devil tree our critics claim for them.

977
01:04:24,299 --> 01:04:26,020
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a quote from there, by the way.

978
01:04:27,841 --> 01:04:30,281
[SPEAKER_00]: Number five, preach moderation and promote good parenting.

979
01:04:30,321 --> 01:04:34,563
[SPEAKER_00]: Remind parents moderation in all things, including video games, is important.

980
01:04:34,603 --> 01:04:36,544
[SPEAKER_00]: You're responsible as parents to oversee this.

981
01:04:36,784 --> 01:04:37,264
[SPEAKER_00]: Amen!

982
01:04:38,144 --> 01:04:38,425
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.

983
01:04:38,665 --> 01:04:39,725
[SPEAKER_00]: What site is this coming from?

984
01:04:41,026 --> 01:04:46,248
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually from Next Generation.

985
01:04:46,768 --> 01:04:47,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

986
01:04:47,788 --> 01:04:48,849
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is pretty cool.

987
01:04:48,869 --> 01:04:49,449
[SPEAKER_05]: This is pretty smart.

988
01:04:49,669 --> 01:04:49,789
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

989
01:04:50,901 --> 01:04:55,383
[SPEAKER_00]: Six, benchmark against sex and violence in Prime Network TV and movies.

990
01:04:55,763 --> 01:04:58,204
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think video games have cornered the market on sex and violence.

991
01:04:58,424 --> 01:04:58,884
[SPEAKER_00]: Amen.

992
01:04:59,905 --> 01:05:03,286
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's funny that they showed a slide of David Hasselhoff in a Speedo.

993
01:05:03,846 --> 01:05:11,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they suggesting that the gaming industry run essentially like a political ad smear campaign would be?

994
01:05:11,549 --> 01:05:15,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Try to run a campaign that says games are not as evil as movies?

995
01:05:15,951 --> 01:05:17,011
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of how I read that.

996
01:05:17,171 --> 01:05:18,532
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, keep in mind that

997
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:25,624
[SPEAKER_00]: Watching the news, how many violent acts do you see or hear about just watching the news?

998
01:05:25,664 --> 01:05:28,850
[SPEAKER_05]: True, but the politicians are trying to say that's all because of games.

999
01:05:31,264 --> 01:05:33,185
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the facts are there.

1000
01:05:33,305 --> 01:05:36,207
[SPEAKER_00]: Crime among youth has been in decline.

1001
01:05:37,508 --> 01:05:38,288
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't believe me?

1002
01:05:38,408 --> 01:05:39,649
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask the Department of Justice.

1003
01:05:40,189 --> 01:05:40,929
[SPEAKER_00]: The numbers are there.

1004
01:05:43,351 --> 01:05:45,252
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven, embrace the Constitution.

1005
01:05:45,312 --> 01:05:49,674
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a right in this industry to make and market our product in an unregulated manner.

1006
01:05:50,154 --> 01:05:52,095
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be talking about what our rights are.

1007
01:05:52,175 --> 01:05:55,697
[SPEAKER_00]: Video games are part art and part commerce.

1008
01:05:56,138 --> 01:05:57,558
[SPEAKER_00]: Both parts are protected.

1009
01:05:58,699 --> 01:05:59,299
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight, lobby.

1010
01:05:59,479 --> 01:06:00,420
[SPEAKER_00]: Make political donations.

1011
01:06:02,675 --> 01:06:04,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

1012
01:06:15,262 --> 01:06:17,403
[SPEAKER_00]: 9.

1013
01:06:15,282 --> 01:06:17,403
[SPEAKER_00]: Harness our best spokespeople.

1014
01:06:17,443 --> 01:06:19,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Have them talk about why they like video games.

1015
01:06:43,644 --> 01:06:55,512
[SPEAKER_00]: have basically using high profile celebrities benefits just to bring different people in by saying their favorite stars say, oh, I like this game.

1016
01:06:55,772 --> 01:07:01,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Sadly enough, I don't want to mention this because I really hate the idea anyways, but you have the Hip Hop Gaming League.

1017
01:07:02,016 --> 01:07:05,278
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, most people, I wouldn't see them as really...

1018
01:07:06,357 --> 01:07:08,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Number 10 was demonstrate the most creative games.

1019
01:07:08,839 --> 01:07:15,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Halo and Grand Theft Auto represent us in the marketplace, but we need to show people it's not all about guns and boobs.

1020
01:07:33,410 --> 01:07:39,194
[SPEAKER_00]: Katamari Namashi, DDR, Parappa, Donkey Konga, and Guitar Heroes are all games the whole family can enjoy and play.

1021
01:07:40,374 --> 01:07:44,157
[SPEAKER_05]: But a little guitar, or I'm sorry, a little guitar, a little violence and boobs never hurt anyone.

1022
01:07:44,437 --> 01:07:44,557
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

1023
01:07:45,077 --> 01:07:46,218
[SPEAKER_00]: I still think we need air guitar freaks.

1024
01:07:46,278 --> 01:07:46,438
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 18.

1025
01:07:46,558 --> 01:07:47,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Hooray for boobies.

1026
01:07:49,019 --> 01:07:49,700
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good album.

1027
01:07:51,301 --> 01:07:52,001
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Bloodhound Gang.

1028
01:07:52,862 --> 01:07:55,503
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not that retarded when it comes to pop culture anyway.

1029
01:07:56,364 --> 01:07:55,503
11.

1030
01:07:56,684 --> 01:08:03,048
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem in statistical perspective, less than 20% of all games released are M-rated, a minority of the product.

1031
01:08:03,891 --> 01:08:04,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Good point.

1032
01:08:04,731 --> 01:08:05,152
[SPEAKER_00]: Amen.

1033
01:08:06,112 --> 01:08:05,152
12.

1034
01:08:06,252 --> 01:08:06,712
[SPEAKER_00]: Be proud.

1035
01:08:06,772 --> 01:08:08,253
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be ashamed to say you like video games.

1036
01:08:08,273 --> 01:08:09,834
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be sure to tell people why you like them.

1037
01:08:12,675 --> 01:08:14,156
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like them.

1038
01:08:14,196 --> 01:08:15,637
[SPEAKER_05]: I run into this all the time at work.

1039
01:08:16,197 --> 01:08:21,920
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell people that, yeah, I do this thing on the internet about video games, and they're kind of like, oh, really?

1040
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:25,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, oh, you're like that, huh?

1041
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:25,822
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm

1042
01:08:28,314 --> 01:08:28,994
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's weird?

1043
01:08:29,174 --> 01:08:32,695
[SPEAKER_05]: I get more of a reaction from telling someone I'm a gamer than telling them I'm gay.

1044
01:08:33,535 --> 01:08:34,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, I do.

1045
01:08:35,396 --> 01:08:38,716
[SPEAKER_05]: I tell somebody at work I'm gay and they go, oh, okay, yeah, we all knew that.

1046
01:08:39,056 --> 01:08:43,217
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I tell somebody that I'm a gamer, they're like, oh, wow, you play games?

1047
01:08:45,338 --> 01:08:45,838
[SPEAKER_00]: Crazy, crazy.

1048
01:08:45,858 --> 01:08:46,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Weird, huh?

1049
01:08:47,178 --> 01:08:47,718
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the culture.

1050
01:08:49,159 --> 01:08:50,299
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a proud gamer.

1051
01:08:50,579 --> 01:08:50,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Amen.

1052
01:08:52,299 --> 01:08:53,960
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?

1053
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:55,040
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be a number 13 on there.

1054
01:08:56,528 --> 01:08:59,771
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're female, tell the boys to piss off if they say you can't play a video game.

1055
01:08:59,791 --> 01:09:00,292
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1056
01:09:01,453 --> 01:09:02,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Or just beat them to shit.

1057
01:09:02,674 --> 01:09:03,015
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1058
01:09:03,455 --> 01:09:06,238
[SPEAKER_00]: You take those platform boots and knock them upside the head.

1059
01:09:07,079 --> 01:09:07,800
[SPEAKER_00]: You heard that from me.

1060
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:08,701
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1061
01:09:09,181 --> 01:09:10,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go.

1062
01:09:10,983 --> 01:09:11,744
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a very good top 12.

1063
01:09:12,405 --> 01:09:13,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Next Generations I came from?

1064
01:09:14,387 --> 01:09:14,567
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1065
01:09:14,647 --> 01:09:15,989
[SPEAKER_05]: I tipped my hat to that website.

1066
01:09:16,029 --> 01:09:16,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Very nice.

1067
01:09:16,389 --> 01:09:18,231
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's next-gen.com.

1068
01:09:18,691 --> 01:09:18,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

1069
01:09:20,154 --> 01:09:21,094
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a story here.

1070
01:09:21,214 --> 01:09:24,855
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying to wrap up this first half of the show here, but plenty more stories to come here.

1071
01:09:25,175 --> 01:09:27,376
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to talk about GameTap real quick.

1072
01:09:27,776 --> 01:09:33,758
[SPEAKER_05]: GameTap is now going to be offering previews and trailers on their service.

1073
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:36,238
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like a try before you buy type thing.

1074
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:42,240
[SPEAKER_05]: But they recently signed an agreement with Strategy First, who made Galactic Civilizations, and

1075
01:09:43,061 --> 01:09:47,762
[SPEAKER_05]: This will allow customers to preview full versions of their pre-release titles.

1076
01:09:48,262 --> 01:09:57,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds to me a little bit like the Xbox Live model, a little bit like the demos, but a very interesting way for the PC publishers and GameTap to find that harmony.

1077
01:09:58,305 --> 01:10:01,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I'm all for easy access to game demos.

1078
01:10:01,146 --> 01:10:04,267
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a great idea, so I tip my hat to GameTap as well.

1079
01:10:05,147 --> 01:10:06,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of smart people in gaming this week.

1080
01:10:06,627 --> 01:10:07,728
[SPEAKER_05]: This is good news.

1081
01:10:08,648 --> 01:10:12,249
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's go to the next story, which is from Loki.

1082
01:10:13,032 --> 01:10:17,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, let's talk a little bit about Xbox and the patch systems.

1083
01:10:18,154 --> 01:10:19,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotta love the way they patch games.

1084
01:10:20,434 --> 01:10:21,235
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate it.

1085
01:10:21,375 --> 01:10:30,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a dumb idea to release games that aren't ready for the market because they have bugs, and they do it knowingly that they have these errors in the games.

1086
01:10:30,478 --> 01:10:37,020
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, Dead or Alive 4, there's a mandatory patch that's fixing bugs and adding no new content coming soon.

1087
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:40,321
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also going to help balance some of the characters, but

1088
01:10:40,745 --> 01:11:09,337
[SPEAKER_03]: basically the fix the save bug yay that's something great oh guess what you know those demo kiosks out there that you could download the xbox car for burnout guess what it doesn't work it doesn't work at all because it's broken yes that's right um EA has actually said there's at right now there's no official date of the patch but there will be one to fix the 360 kiosk car because it doesn't work very fun um another thing

1089
01:11:11,337 --> 01:11:27,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter is going to be getting updates soon to add the Southpaw controller configuration and to fix the bugs in their save system that cause your save game to get deleted, just like it did in Full Auto and in Call of Duty 2.

1090
01:11:28,647 --> 01:11:34,470
[SPEAKER_03]: My question is, why are they releasing all these games out there if it's constantly...

1091
01:11:35,481 --> 01:11:35,801
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like it.

1092
01:11:35,841 --> 01:11:36,402
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you guys think?

1093
01:12:04,511 --> 01:12:12,133
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely don't think that people should be releasing games that are only half-finished, and I don't think patching is the way to fix your game on the back end.

1094
01:12:12,173 --> 01:12:20,056
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, I do realize that the occasional error is going to come up that people don't find.

1095
01:12:20,716 --> 01:12:24,797
[SPEAKER_05]: People that find loopholes and stuff, and let's say they didn't know about this whole full-auto patching.

1096
01:12:25,037 --> 01:12:25,217
[SPEAKER_05]: and so on.

1097
01:12:51,752 --> 01:12:52,413
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on.

1098
01:12:52,673 --> 01:12:55,736
[SPEAKER_03]: That screams, oh, we didn't test this on a normal TV.

1099
01:12:55,796 --> 01:12:58,618
[SPEAKER_03]: We just used our LCD monitors that we have here at work.

1100
01:12:58,658 --> 01:12:59,840
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked fine on that.

1101
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,302
[SPEAKER_03]: God, that's just lazy.

1102
01:13:02,742 --> 01:13:04,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Extremely lazy.

1103
01:13:04,084 --> 01:13:05,845
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they have to go back and fix that.

1104
01:13:05,945 --> 01:13:07,527
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so stupid.

1105
01:13:08,087 --> 01:13:08,828
[SPEAKER_03]: What can we do about it?

1106
01:13:09,428 --> 01:13:10,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Vote with your wallet.

1107
01:13:29,036 --> 01:13:31,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Still though, I mean, why?

1108
01:13:31,458 --> 01:13:34,720
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times we don't know that these bugs are there until after you buy the game.

1109
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:39,123
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you know, you play all the way through Call of Duty and all of a sudden, oh, my save game's gone.

1110
01:13:39,443 --> 01:13:41,945
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a nice bonus feature that wasn't mentioned on the box art.

1111
01:13:42,885 --> 01:13:44,246
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

1112
01:13:44,346 --> 01:13:48,069
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the idea of patching it to fix stuff and maybe add content later on.

1113
01:13:48,169 --> 01:13:57,835
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like it as an excuse to release a game like Call of Duty 2 whose online multiplayer sucks ass because there's so much lag on it and they obviously didn't test it.

1114
01:13:58,914 --> 01:14:01,175
[SPEAKER_05]: So, alright.

1115
01:14:02,015 --> 01:14:10,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if you have a response to Loki's little rant, you could always send us an email, and that was sent to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

1116
01:14:10,298 --> 01:14:11,359
[SPEAKER_05]: We love to hear from you guys.

1117
01:14:12,079 --> 01:14:18,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Every week, DarkSakura likes to go into our mailbag and stick her hand in the mailbag and dig out her favorite letters.

1118
01:14:19,061 --> 01:14:22,883
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is mailbag with a B, not hag with an H. Mail hag.

1119
01:14:23,443 --> 01:14:24,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Is DarkSakura our mail hag?

1120
01:14:25,944 --> 01:14:26,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Just teasing.

1121
01:14:27,290 --> 01:14:28,771
[SPEAKER_05]: I say that I tease because I love.

1122
01:14:29,031 --> 01:14:29,992
[SPEAKER_00]: That disturbs me.

1123
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:31,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't give me evil glares.

1124
01:14:31,473 --> 01:14:32,794
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't give you an evil glare.

1125
01:14:32,854 --> 01:14:34,155
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a disturbed look.

1126
01:14:34,616 --> 01:14:36,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, DarkSakura likes to dig into the mailbag.

1127
01:14:36,697 --> 01:14:37,818
[SPEAKER_05]: She's going to do that right now.

1128
01:14:37,838 --> 01:14:38,539
[SPEAKER_05]: With a shovel.

1129
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:40,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you all sanitized and ready to go?

1130
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:41,741
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the hazmat suit.

1131
01:14:43,563 --> 01:14:47,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, who emailed us this week?

1132
01:14:48,186 --> 01:14:48,747
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of people.

1133
01:14:50,288 --> 01:14:50,768
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.

1134
01:14:50,888 --> 01:14:51,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Attention rocks.

1135
01:14:52,677 --> 01:14:56,659
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, our good buddy Roblay pointed out a few things.

1136
01:14:57,539 --> 01:15:04,042
[SPEAKER_00]: That basically, not only is Xbox getting in all over the 360 thing, we now have 360.yahoo.com.

1137
01:15:04,783 --> 01:15:06,643
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the Colgate 360.

1138
01:15:07,684 --> 01:15:11,405
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have Anderson Cooper 360 on CNN.

1139
01:15:12,146 --> 01:15:13,546
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a brilliant observation.

1140
01:15:14,407 --> 01:15:15,687
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to launch Orange Launch Radio 360.

1141
01:15:15,727 --> 01:15:15,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Ha ha ha!

1142
01:15:20,270 --> 01:15:22,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that can be the name of our fan club.

1143
01:15:22,272 --> 01:15:24,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, speaking of fan clubs, can I plug the new Myspace?

1144
01:15:25,405 --> 01:15:27,967
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, as someone didn't do in our LiveJournal community either.

1145
01:15:27,987 --> 01:15:28,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, my bad.

1146
01:15:28,828 --> 01:15:29,669
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a new MySpace.

1147
01:15:29,709 --> 01:15:30,289
[SPEAKER_05]: It's brand new.

1148
01:15:30,349 --> 01:15:31,530
[SPEAKER_05]: It's different from the group.

1149
01:15:31,550 --> 01:15:34,593
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a fan that made a group, but now we have an actual user account.

1150
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:37,155
[SPEAKER_05]: We're a band because we want to be rock stars.

1151
01:15:37,395 --> 01:15:39,317
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can actually listen to clips from old shows.

1152
01:15:40,018 --> 01:15:44,341
[SPEAKER_05]: And you remember Jaime's email from last week where she was pointing out all the good clips from older shows?

1153
01:15:44,461 --> 01:15:44,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1154
01:15:44,882 --> 01:15:47,544
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually put the Mega Man clip on our MySpace.

1155
01:15:47,804 --> 01:15:51,728
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's www.myspace.com slash OrangeloungeRadio.

1156
01:15:52,368 --> 01:15:57,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we know MySpace is where the internet goes to die, but if we can promote ourselves on it, hey, we'll sell our souls to MySpace.

1157
01:15:57,992 --> 01:16:04,297
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually listening to that the other day, and just cracking up, and my husband thought that I had gone nuts.

1158
01:16:05,998 --> 01:16:10,001
[SPEAKER_07]: The freaky part about MySpace is Fox is now using it to promote their TV shows.

1159
01:16:10,221 --> 01:16:11,222
[SPEAKER_05]: I am not surprised.

1160
01:16:11,242 --> 01:16:12,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is lame.

1161
01:16:12,563 --> 01:16:12,863
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean...

1162
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:15,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they own it, so why not?

1163
01:16:15,922 --> 01:16:16,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, check it out.

1164
01:16:17,723 --> 01:16:21,266
[SPEAKER_05]: MySpace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and add us because we want like a zillion friends.

1165
01:16:21,386 --> 01:16:21,647
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1166
01:16:22,167 --> 01:16:22,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry to interrupt.

1167
01:16:23,148 --> 01:16:24,989
[SPEAKER_00]: We got an email from DJ Ratchet.

1168
01:16:26,531 --> 01:16:33,316
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, just to go into it, if we wanted to thank us for reading the email in the last podcast.

1169
01:16:34,637 --> 01:16:45,302
[SPEAKER_00]: but also asked a question about Kingdom Hearts 2 which I actually did reply to about the different summons wanting to know if Chicken Little was in the game.

1170
01:16:46,002 --> 01:16:49,384
[SPEAKER_00]: Chicken Little has been confirmed as a summon in Kingdom Hearts 2.

1171
01:16:50,124 --> 01:16:51,004
[SPEAKER_00]: Just thought I'd let you know.

1172
01:16:53,506 --> 01:16:58,548
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what, I actually should be playing more Kingdom Hearts 2 but I have this issue with playing games in Japanese.

1173
01:16:59,534 --> 01:17:05,018
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do it, but then reading... I have to sit there with my dictionary and try to translate the kanji and it gives me a headache.

1174
01:17:05,118 --> 01:17:06,078
[SPEAKER_00]: She said dick.

1175
01:17:06,959 --> 01:17:07,239
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey!

1176
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:09,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I had to do that.

1177
01:17:10,001 --> 01:17:11,162
[SPEAKER_00]: I say dick all the time.

1178
01:17:12,002 --> 01:17:13,263
[SPEAKER_00]: Dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick.

1179
01:17:15,525 --> 01:17:17,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we should just cut that little clip and put that on our MySpace.

1180
01:17:17,846 --> 01:17:19,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, moving on.

1181
01:17:19,988 --> 01:17:20,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Dick, dick.

1182
01:17:21,709 --> 01:17:22,229
[SPEAKER_00]: Dick, dick, dick.

1183
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:25,571
[SPEAKER_00]: Why am I now thinking of that scene in Spaceballs?

1184
01:17:26,051 --> 01:17:26,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Asshole.

1185
01:17:26,492 --> 01:17:26,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Asshole.

1186
01:17:28,465 --> 01:17:29,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I have to separate you two?

1187
01:17:30,726 --> 01:17:31,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Next up.

1188
01:17:31,607 --> 01:17:31,947
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1189
01:17:32,587 --> 01:17:37,210
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an email from, and I have to scroll down to see who this is from, Sycoon.

1190
01:17:37,330 --> 01:17:38,831
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.

1191
01:17:40,672 --> 01:17:43,353
[SPEAKER_00]: This is about, you know, old school games.

1192
01:17:43,393 --> 01:17:49,917
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a big fan of the old school games, like in the gameplay, but lots of people out there are saying graphics over the games.

1193
01:17:50,777 --> 01:17:57,081
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I know, it's like they're saying, oh, this game sucks because it doesn't look pretty.

1194
01:17:58,035 --> 01:17:58,675
[SPEAKER_00]: That's stupid.

1195
01:18:01,176 --> 01:18:01,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1196
01:18:02,077 --> 01:18:03,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Case in point, Geometry Wars.

1197
01:18:04,378 --> 01:18:05,798
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty, too.

1198
01:18:05,838 --> 01:18:11,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Geometry Wars is a pretty game, but it's not exactly pushing the 360s hardware to its limits.

1199
01:18:12,181 --> 01:18:12,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Radiant Silvergun.

1200
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:14,502
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, thank you.

1201
01:18:14,902 --> 01:18:16,082
[SPEAKER_00]: Radiant Silvergun is awesome.

1202
01:18:17,243 --> 01:18:19,564
[SPEAKER_00]: Then again, so is Ikaruga, and that was really graphically pretty.

1203
01:18:20,104 --> 01:18:21,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Once in a while, you can still pull up...

1204
01:18:25,345 --> 01:18:29,809
[SPEAKER_05]: You could still pull up an old Atari 2600 Classic on GameTap or emulators or whatever you want to use.

1205
01:18:30,209 --> 01:18:30,969
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're still fun.

1206
01:18:31,050 --> 01:18:32,030
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless it's E.T.

1207
01:18:32,050 --> 01:18:32,751
[SPEAKER_00]: because that game sucked.

1208
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:34,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, but they don't have E.T.

1209
01:18:34,792 --> 01:18:36,634
[SPEAKER_05]: on GameTap and I don't think they exist.

1210
01:18:36,874 --> 01:18:38,395
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Atari's pretty much written E.T.

1211
01:18:38,495 --> 01:18:38,615
[SPEAKER_05]: off.

1212
01:18:39,096 --> 01:18:39,876
[SPEAKER_05]: I have too.

1213
01:18:40,617 --> 01:18:40,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Sucker.

1214
01:18:41,177 --> 01:18:41,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1215
01:18:42,138 --> 01:18:42,599
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't buy them.

1216
01:18:43,539 --> 01:18:44,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Dios!

1217
01:18:45,219 --> 01:18:54,623
[SPEAKER_00]: But just to go ahead and read a paragraph out of this letter, it said, I just want to know why many people now think that graphics are more important to a game than gameplay.

1218
01:18:55,083 --> 01:19:06,588
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually played Sonic Adventure with a friend of mine, and he complained about how blocky it looked to him as compared to Half-Life 2 and Halo 2, and he didn't like it just for that reason, although Sonic Adventure still is a great game.

1219
01:19:06,848 --> 01:19:08,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, he was comparing first version to 2.

1220
01:19:08,589 --> 01:19:10,430
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Sonic Adventure 2 wasn't as...

1221
01:19:14,005 --> 01:19:17,266
[SPEAKER_00]: Sonic Adventure was really smooth, very nice.

1222
01:19:17,326 --> 01:19:20,668
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't think of any games on Dreamcast that were blocky at all.

1223
01:19:20,948 --> 01:19:23,769
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not since the early PlayStation games.

1224
01:19:23,829 --> 01:19:25,209
[SPEAKER_00]: And even then, it's like, who cares?

1225
01:19:25,269 --> 01:19:27,970
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite games ever on PlayStation is called Evil Zone.

1226
01:19:28,590 --> 01:19:31,592
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really horrible looking, but it's so cheeseball.

1227
01:19:31,612 --> 01:19:34,273
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make fun of every anime in existence.

1228
01:19:34,493 --> 01:19:37,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's just spoiled by next-gen pretty stuff, you know?

1229
01:19:40,576 --> 01:19:51,845
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just because we grew up with the we have nothing but gameplay that we have a better appreciation for a game that plays well versus a game that looks pretty and plays like crap.

1230
01:19:52,105 --> 01:19:53,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Half-Life 2 plays well.

1231
01:19:56,308 --> 01:19:57,709
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't play first person.

1232
01:19:57,749 --> 01:20:04,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Halo is a pretty game and it's a good game, don't get me wrong, but don't knock Sonic Adventure just because it's not pristine.

1233
01:20:04,761 --> 01:20:05,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Sonic Team Camera

1234
01:20:24,341 --> 01:20:32,066
[SPEAKER_00]: In another Dreamcast game, Blue Stinger, I had the Japanese version, where it had the big cinematic camera angles.

1235
01:20:32,907 --> 01:20:38,810
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to do that scene where you're climbing up the tower when the camera is like 50 miles above the tower.

1236
01:20:39,591 --> 01:20:42,513
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh, yay, I'm going to pretend I know where I'm going.

1237
01:20:44,494 --> 01:20:45,675
[SPEAKER_00]: So, next letter, shall I?

1238
01:20:46,075 --> 01:20:46,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

1239
01:20:47,076 --> 01:20:47,776
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one from Rob.

1240
01:20:49,057 --> 01:20:50,978
[SPEAKER_00]: About Lieberman being the porker of the month.

1241
01:20:52,619 --> 01:20:53,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, fatty?

1242
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:53,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1243
01:20:54,139 --> 01:20:56,482
[SPEAKER_00]: CDC Investigate Video Games Disease Control?

1244
01:21:11,025 --> 01:21:18,613
[SPEAKER_05]: This Katamari game made me lose my mind and I've just gone crazy and I worship the king of all cosmos.

1245
01:21:18,633 --> 01:21:25,220
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to look at the impact of electronic media use organized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

1246
01:21:26,666 --> 01:21:35,752
[SPEAKER_00]: To go ahead and read a little bit of this article, even though the legislation called the Children and Media Research Advancement Act does not include restrictions, it appears to be intended as a way to justify them.

1247
01:21:36,292 --> 01:21:45,677
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because a string of court decisions have been striking down anti-gaming laws because of a lack of hard evidence that minors are harmed by violence in video games.

1248
01:21:46,778 --> 01:21:47,778
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, take that out on anyone.

1249
01:21:48,099 --> 01:21:49,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Your tax dollars at work, ladies and gentlemen.

1250
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:53,642
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, they can't admit that they're wrong.

1251
01:21:54,560 --> 01:22:06,729
[SPEAKER_00]: They've, you know, how many times have we seen all of, you know, the courts basically upholding what we've been saying for ages, that there's not really any type of major harm to come to it unless you're counting home environment.

1252
01:22:07,429 --> 01:22:09,130
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're saying, no, no, it's a video game.

1253
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:11,292
[SPEAKER_00]: Parents are not allowed to raise their children.

1254
01:22:13,553 --> 01:22:14,274
[SPEAKER_00]: Stupid people.

1255
01:22:16,395 --> 01:22:17,076
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it that

1256
01:22:19,073 --> 01:22:21,614
[SPEAKER_00]: Tag and Release Program Best Name Ever for Vaporware Like Melbourne, Australia?

1257
01:22:51,133 --> 01:22:52,475
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go ahead and quote from here.

1258
01:22:53,075 --> 01:22:54,757
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to add a bit to what he said.

1259
01:22:54,837 --> 01:23:03,085
[SPEAKER_00]: The company spent around $62 million on stuff for the last year, with around $3.5 million spent on the actual console development.

1260
01:23:03,346 --> 01:23:05,488
[SPEAKER_00]: This may be because the console is a scam.

1261
01:23:06,212 --> 01:23:16,976
[SPEAKER_00]: You see what the console makers, or non-makers in this case, could be doing is just getting lots of money from investors to say they're going to make a console when they actually spend very little on the console and keep some of the money for themselves.

1262
01:23:17,536 --> 01:23:22,578
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, they hire their family as consultants, pay them $200,000 a year while also paying themselves money.

1263
01:23:24,298 --> 01:23:25,799
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ask me, quite a good idea, really.

1264
01:23:26,694 --> 01:23:29,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Launch Radio will be coming out with its own console very soon.

1265
01:23:29,316 --> 01:23:32,739
[SPEAKER_05]: We're looking for investors, so if you have $11 billion, please send us an email.

1266
01:23:33,219 --> 01:23:34,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

1267
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:36,081
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd love to hear from you.

1268
01:23:36,282 --> 01:23:39,684
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when they were showing the Phantom at E3, was it in 2004?

1269
01:23:39,924 --> 01:23:42,526
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a cute little booth.

1270
01:23:42,706 --> 01:23:49,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they had a booth, and I tried to go in the wrong entrance or something, and they got all pissed off at me or something.

1271
01:23:49,872 --> 01:23:52,574
[SPEAKER_03]: So then I walked around the normal way, and then I saw their

1272
01:23:53,463 --> 01:23:55,145
[SPEAKER_03]: T-shirt sucks, um

1273
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:24,604
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the only thing I liked about the console was the case, and I wanted to make a computer out of the case.

1274
01:24:24,985 --> 01:24:29,569
[SPEAKER_03]: That was about it, because it had this, like, glowing blue light on the front, and that looked cool.

1275
01:24:30,710 --> 01:24:33,712
[SPEAKER_03]: But other than that, it was, like, huge.

1276
01:24:33,852 --> 01:24:37,315
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the size of a large VCR.

1277
01:24:37,375 --> 01:24:38,977
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this thing was ginormous.

1278
01:24:39,217 --> 01:24:40,338
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like a stupid brick.

1279
01:24:42,140 --> 01:24:42,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Any more emails?

1280
01:24:43,381 --> 01:24:44,201
[SPEAKER_00]: One more, one more.

1281
01:24:44,221 --> 01:24:44,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Alrighty.

1282
01:24:44,742 --> 01:24:45,342
[SPEAKER_00]: From Jaded.

1283
01:24:45,783 --> 01:24:46,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Jaded.

1284
01:24:46,944 --> 01:24:46,984
[SPEAKER_00]: Um...

1285
01:24:47,805 --> 01:24:52,629
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an interesting article that he wants us to look at about, it's actually something on Slashdot.

1286
01:24:55,431 --> 01:24:59,093
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a really, really quick little article, so I'm just going to read what it says.

1287
01:24:59,214 --> 01:24:59,474
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

1288
01:25:04,738 --> 01:25:05,038
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1289
01:25:05,418 --> 01:25:14,365
[SPEAKER_00]: Kotaku has a great feature up today written by James Wagner, a formerly embedded reporter in the world of Second Life.

1290
01:25:15,003 --> 01:25:17,107
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1291
01:25:27,841 --> 01:25:33,824
[SPEAKER_00]: For the thing of it is, game magazine previews are almost uniformly positive even for the most undistinguished titles.

1292
01:25:34,284 --> 01:25:35,424
[SPEAKER_00]: So it unrolls thus.

1293
01:25:35,524 --> 01:25:37,045
[SPEAKER_00]: Publisher makes mediocre game.

1294
01:25:37,145 --> 01:25:44,188
[SPEAKER_00]: Press reviews, I'm sorry, press previews depict mediocre game as being good or at least worth a look.

1295
01:25:44,488 --> 01:25:52,311
[SPEAKER_00]: Excited gamers read previews, foolishly believe them, start making pre-sale orders of mediocre games driven by preview press and pre-sale numbers based on that press.

1296
01:25:54,952 --> 01:25:57,272
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Yola.

1297
01:25:57,872 --> 01:26:00,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1298
01:26:00,473 --> 01:26:06,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe if we add on to that successfully, we get E, gamers discover independent podcasts.

1299
01:26:07,034 --> 01:26:09,975
[SPEAKER_05]: F, gamers get the real story from people who actually play the games.

1300
01:26:10,375 --> 01:26:12,215
[SPEAKER_05]: G, quality games inherit the earth.

1301
01:26:13,495 --> 01:26:14,035
[SPEAKER_00]: Hooray for us.

1302
01:26:16,476 --> 01:26:18,556
[SPEAKER_00]: We are your video game saviors.

1303
01:26:20,337 --> 01:26:20,717
[SPEAKER_00]: Hooray.

1304
01:26:20,877 --> 01:26:21,257
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1305
01:26:22,183 --> 01:26:22,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that it for the mail?

1306
01:26:23,104 --> 01:26:23,344
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

1307
01:26:23,404 --> 01:26:28,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, send your mail to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Loki, take us out of this hour.

1308
01:26:28,306 --> 01:26:31,808
[SPEAKER_05]: You have some follow-ups, some quickie little follow-ups to things we were bitching about last week.

1309
01:26:32,208 --> 01:26:45,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the first thing is, if you're hoping for another NFL game by someone other than EA, sorry, NFL extended the CBA and EA still holds exclusive rights to the NFL.

1310
01:26:46,415 --> 01:26:46,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1311
01:26:46,875 --> 01:26:47,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Eh, I kind of saw that coming.

1312
01:26:48,216 --> 01:26:48,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, anyways.

1313
01:26:49,918 --> 01:26:52,081
[SPEAKER_03]: The Origami, what is the Origami?

1314
01:26:52,501 --> 01:27:00,473
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a 7 inch tablet PC that runs Windows and it's going to be under $1000 Only?

1315
01:27:01,153 --> 01:27:03,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, is it a gaming system?

1316
01:27:03,377 --> 01:27:03,477
[SPEAKER_03]: No

1317
01:27:04,153 --> 01:27:05,273
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a gaming system.

1318
01:27:05,333 --> 01:27:08,695
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more of a micro-laptop type thing.

1319
01:27:08,735 --> 01:27:09,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Minesweeper on the go.

1320
01:27:09,995 --> 01:27:10,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

1321
01:27:10,655 --> 01:27:15,177
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, there is a video file out on YouTube.

1322
01:27:15,917 --> 01:27:17,418
[SPEAKER_00]: I love YouTube.

1323
01:27:17,638 --> 01:27:24,000
[SPEAKER_00]: Where someone apparently leaked one of their marketing demos that they were showing during their little meetings.

1324
01:27:24,420 --> 01:27:26,381
[SPEAKER_00]: And it did show somebody actually playing a game on it.

1325
01:27:26,481 --> 01:27:28,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually, that wasn't a market.

1326
01:27:28,361 --> 01:27:30,562
[SPEAKER_03]: It was on their viral site that they had online.

1327
01:27:31,122 --> 01:27:37,445
[SPEAKER_03]: OrigamiProject.com and it was just a concept, proof of concept.

1328
01:27:37,545 --> 01:27:41,246
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't actually playing a video or a game because it was showing Halo 2.

1329
01:27:42,527 --> 01:27:45,028
[SPEAKER_00]: But then they listed it there as a potential for the machine.

1330
01:27:45,388 --> 01:27:46,809
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkTetsuya in our chatroom says $999.99.

1331
01:27:46,889 --> 01:27:49,169
[SPEAKER_05]: When you say under $1,000, does that mean $999.99?

1332
01:27:49,209 --> 01:27:49,470
[SPEAKER_05]: More likely.

1333
01:27:49,490 --> 01:27:50,250
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to sell it for $656.

1334
01:27:50,290 --> 01:27:51,310
[SPEAKER_05]: They have three different versions of the

1335
01:27:58,474 --> 01:27:59,875
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not even really the origami.

1336
01:27:59,915 --> 01:28:02,737
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I forget what it's called now.

1337
01:28:02,817 --> 01:28:07,720
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the mini PC or something like that.

1338
01:28:07,780 --> 01:28:09,921
[SPEAKER_03]: I forget how they were calling them.

1339
01:28:11,102 --> 01:28:14,664
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically just this really small PC.

1340
01:28:15,765 --> 01:28:16,285
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about it.

1341
01:28:17,806 --> 01:28:18,086
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1342
01:28:18,767 --> 01:28:19,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other follow-ups?

1343
01:28:21,068 --> 01:28:21,188
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1344
01:28:21,448 --> 01:28:22,009
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1345
01:28:22,049 --> 01:28:23,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I think we're finally due for a break.

1346
01:28:23,850 --> 01:28:27,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Our first hour has turned into our first hour and a half segment, but that's okay.
