VD. Anyway my name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Sky. Joining me as always

18
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,240
say hello to the one and only

19
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,360
Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers. How you doing?

20
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:21,600
What's frustrating? You were in such a good mood just like two minutes ago.

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,840
I wasn't in a good mood because your mocha attacked me.

22
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,080
I do appreciate the...

23
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,760
I'm chocolaty good, dammit.

24
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,600
Well now you smell like chocolate, so...

25
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,980
I smelled like cherries before, I'd rather.

26
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:40,780
You know, chocolate covered cherries is a delicacy in some places.

27
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,920
Say hello also to Tech Master Loki.

28
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,920
Hi.

29
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,920
How you doing?

30
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,920
I'm doing great.

31
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,920
Alright.

32
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,920
Sounds good.

33
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,080
Once in a while we'd like to invite somebody special to come on the show.

34
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,760
Say hello to our local buddy, Bugd.

35
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,940
I'm just special now?

36
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,940
You're very special.

37
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,940
Okay.

38
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,940
Bugd has known me for how long?

39
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,940
How long have you known me, Bugd?

40
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,940
I can't admit this.

41
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:01,940
What?

42
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,940
No, I can't.

43
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,940
Why?

44
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,940
I just can't.

45
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:05,940
Well, then I'll say it.

46
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,940
It's probably been at least...

47
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,940
Seventeen.

48
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,940
Seventeen years?

49
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,940
You're kidding.

50
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:10,940
Oh, my gosh.

51
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,940
No, I guess it has been ten years since high school.

52
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,940
That's why I didn't want to admit it.

53
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,940
Oh, my God.

54
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,940
See?

55
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,940
Exactly.

56
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,400
Some of our listeners are 17, even younger than that.

57
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,400
Oh, my gosh.

58
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,400
All right.

59
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:27,920
All right, well here we are another week talk about those games that we love and adore especially games that don't suck

60
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,680
But you know once in a while

61
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,720
We got to tell you about the ones that do just to tell you to stay away from them

62
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,840
Let's get into it as we start off every week with a little bit of how is your gaming week a chance for us?

63
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,840
To tell you what's going on in our gaming world

64
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,140
Because we're gamers just like you Dark Sakura. What do you been playing this week?

65
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,740
Not much of anything because my week has been really

66
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:50,220
you know busy with me dropping school and stuff.

67
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,620
I quit school to play video games.

68
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:57,900
Way to set an example for those seventeen-year-olds listening. I dropped a class due to

69
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,500
time constraints, I've played Animal Crossing and Puzzle Fighter.

70
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,660
Puzzle Fighter, now that's an oldie but goodie. And we've had some

71
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:09,580
burnout going on in the house and I've been avoiding it like the plague. Why?

72
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,700
Because that game gives me a headache. Oh, because all the motion and stuff?

73
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:18,120
that's right I'm you know it because of the really loudness that Dan has our TV

74
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,940
turned up to

75
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:23,580
it's funny you bring a puzzle fighter in college because in college that is a lot

76
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,400
of what I did is play puzzle fighter me my old roommate used to play that

77
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,940
a lot like it was scary how much we play puzzle fighter a lot

78
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,780
okay now I'm having like another bike that made me twitch because it just made

79
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,700
me realize that yes I am older than you are

80
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,980
because not by much what I was playing in college was

81
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,420
The Saturn had just come out and my friend imported one

82
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,260
and we were playing Gundam. It makes you feel better. That was like... KOF 95

83
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,080
and I had a Playstation in my room and we were playing Toshinden all the time.

84
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,820
If it makes you feel better this was like my junior year. My freshman year was

85
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,680
all about Super Mario Kart because I was the only kid in the dorm with the Super

86
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,240
Nintendo.

87
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,140
I had a Super Nintendo and by the way you're making me cry because of next month.

88
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,220
You're also one of the few that were sober.

89
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,540
My birthday is next month. That's right but you're having a big birthday

90
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:17,120
extravaganza right can't wait I get so drunk I forget it's my birthday and this

91
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,880
year this year you might need that but don't we still love you age is just a

92
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,880
number yeah all right Loki how's your gaming week been good been playing both

93
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:34,940
the new burnout well not quite new burnout new to the Xbox 360 burnout and

94
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:41,080
Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter. Burnout hasn't really changed they made it a lot

95
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:47,380
blurrier and I guess higher resolution textures but everything's so blurry and

96
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:52,340
dark it's I don't know it's tough sometimes finding out where you're going

97
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:57,220
headache inducing not headache inducing but just you know trying to see down

98
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:01,860
like a tunnel where driving 200 miles an hour and everything's like like I got

99
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,480
cataracts or something. It's just not good. I don't like what they're doing with these

100
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,640
games where they're putting this like halo effect on everything. So to hide the fact

101
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,040
that the textures aren't quite as good as they should be and the edges aren't quite

102
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:21,240
as smooth as they should be. Listen, we know that the case is that these textures aren't

103
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,640
as good or the graphics aren't as good. You don't need to try to hide it by making everything

104
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:31,640
blurry. Don't pull a Nintendo 64. Now I'm curious, how does a game like Burnout compare

105
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:36,480
to full auto because to me, and let's keep in mind I don't usually play a whole lot

106
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,880
of racing games, to me they're both cars plus destruction equals fun.

107
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,480
So is one superior to the other?

108
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,480
What's the deal?

109
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,720
Burnout is more racing, whereas full auto is more blowing stuff up, because they have,

110
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,160
granted they do have crash mode in burnout, but...

111
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,160
Burnout lacks weapons.

112
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,800
Yeah, you don't have weapons, and also for some reason the burnout in the 360 is a lot

113
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,840
harder than I remember being on the Playstation 2.

114
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,160
Like you smash in the cars and they just do not want to crash.

115
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,640
It's really, you know, the AI is a lot harder this time.

116
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,600
Which I guess is good, but you know, the crash junctions are still fun and stuff.

117
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,940
The graphics are a little bit better, the car models are more detailed so you see more

118
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,040
damage being done to them, but it's not like, ooh, this is a brand new game.

119
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,360
I'm waiting for the next Burnout to come out, and that'll be good.

120
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:35,560
I'm willing to take donations of Xbox 360s, Burnout, and FlatOut to make all these, whatever

121
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,060
the hell the thing is called, FlatOut sucked.

122
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,060
It just FlatOut sucked.

123
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,920
FlatOut 2 is coming out soon as well.

124
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,240
Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter.

125
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,240
What can I say about that?

126
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,760
The game is beautiful.

127
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,000
That is just amazing.

128
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,800
This is probably one of the killer apps for the 360.

129
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,000
The only problem is the learning curve is incredibly high.

130
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,620
For example, I have never played a Ghost Recon game in my life and I tried this today.

131
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:07,700
Now granted it's very pretty and stuff and I kind of got the handle of how to work things,

132
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:12,060
but actually throwing me down into missions is about as effective as throwing me down

133
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:16,060
into a mission in Call of Duty 2 on veteran mode.

134
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:23,100
Basically it's like walking into the Iraq war without any training and hoping to survive.

135
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,820
It's just not, I don't know.

136
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,820
It could be fun.

137
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:31,380
really need to like get better at it but the game itself looks amazing just the whole story

138
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:37,720
part where you're flying over Mexico City it looks it's just wow it's really good.

139
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,380
And then on top of that of course I've been playing Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories

140
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:46,560
I'm very excited that they're gonna be releasing a new Grand Theft Auto on the PSP soon and

141
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,360
Liberty City Stories is supposed to be coming out on the Playstation 2 at the end of April

142
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,560
So that should be interesting, hopefully we'll have online multiplayer with that.

143
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,040
But yeah, right now just kind of starting to finally get back into my winning streaks

144
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,000
again and kicking lots of ass.

145
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So it's fun.

146
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,160
How's online in Burnout?

147
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,520
I haven't played online in Burnout yet.

148
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,520
Full auto though.

149
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,720
I was playing full auto this weekend, playing online in full auto and I have some major

150
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,460
complaints about it.

151
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,540
Not all the races count because of this weird glitch that's in the game.

152
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:23,380
I've played races upon races, like 10 different races, and I look back at my leaderboard and

153
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:27,300
see how many points I have, and the same amount of points, even though I came in first in

154
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:32,300
these races, and it says the number of races hasn't gone up, so nothing's counting.

155
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,540
So I'm wasting my damn time on this stupid thing.

156
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,980
Isn't that because people are dropping before the race is actually finished?

157
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:41,020
I don't know what the case is, but there is a big problem with people dropping out of

158
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,560
the races in this game.

159
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,560
It's really bad.

160
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,060
You know, half the players drop out at the very end.

161
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,880
ever leave them negative feedback because I have a problem people like

162
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,240
randomly boot me from games and marble blast and it's not like I'm any good so

163
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,440
I don't know why they're booting me from the game I don't even have a headset so

164
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,140
it's not like I can trash talk them but they boot me from the game so I'd leave

165
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,480
them negative feedback when they do that well a lot of time it's hard for me

166
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,400
remember who's you know dropped out of the game because you know they're not

167
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,760
gonna appear at the very end or I don't know it's just I'm trying to get the

168
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,720
last few achievements in full auto and those are the online ones and I'm up to

169
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,040
rank 8 right now. So I only have two more to go, but it's really hard when it's not

170
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,820
counting half the races that you're playing. I can be playing it for three hours and only

171
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:27,680
count two races. I mean, it's just a waste of time. And they really need to fix this

172
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,340
kind of stuff. We'll get into this later about how these games are coming out really glitchy

173
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:37,620
and buggy and they're just letting it go to market real quick. Because they can fix it

174
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:42,520
later by patching it. That's just a poor excuse of programming.

175
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:51,420
else? Bug, anything in your gaming week? No, actually I started up Diablo II again. I started

176
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:57,520
up Diablo II again, and I've been bringing up old characters that I've found laying around

177
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:04,040
on other old CDs. Is there still a big online community for Diablo II? I don't care. You

178
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:09,840
don't play online? No. Sometimes I'll play with other local people, set up Hamachi to

179
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,160
do local network sort of thing because with Hamachi you can just basically

180
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,280
everybody it looks like everybody's on the same network hmm I I yeah I haven't

181
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,800
touched Diablo 2 and probably like years but I have you ever played World of

182
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,800
Warcraft no I'm kind of surprised because it to me there's a lot of

183
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,360
similarities. I don't play subscription games. I know. That whole lack of funding. Okay have you ever thought about

184
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,320
Guild Wars? No. Because Guild Wars isn't subscription based and yeah but it's not

185
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,060
World of Warcraft but it's almost it's got a lot of the same elements I mean it

186
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:47,960
isn't but you know there's the look and feel is very similar to me anyway yeah

187
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,260
all right I'll stick to Blizzard all right anything else definitely no

188
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:55,580
fucking Final Fantasy shit you know what's funny about Final Fantasy yeah I

189
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,820
know you two are going back into it Shane's trying to get me back into Final

190
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:03,320
Fantasy 11 and I think I'm gonna do it addict we're gonna we're gonna start

191
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,960
over on a new server. Actually though, you going back to that actually reminds me I did

192
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:12,480
do something else gaming related. Oh? I'm uh, downloading Ragnarok Online again. Oh

193
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,520
god. Addict. I'm going to be playing Ragnarok Online on a private server. Isn't that sad

194
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,600
that we've all gone back to the crack games that we used to play? I can't go back to World

195
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,160
of Warcraft until after I get finances sold, so like, well crap. I need gaming crack. You

196
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,880
know, I'm actually still paying for PSO Blue Burst and I forgot. Ooh, cancel that crap.

197
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:37,920
Do you know how long I was paying for PSO on Xbox and wasn't even using it?

198
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,240
Sad. So you have to pay for

199
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,160
live plus PSO? On the old Xbox, yes.

200
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,560
Unless you're Julie.

201
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,040
She hasn't had to. They haven't built her.

202
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:56,240
Thanks to the new setup on Xbox 360, I think games like Final Fantasy XI that won't

203
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:56,680
apply.

204
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,840
Because you know there's the whole Xbox Live Silver and Xbox Live Gold.

205
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,760
Well, you don't pay for silver. Silver comes with your Xbox 360

206
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,700
and silver is enough to, you know, get your account, your basics, and see who's

207
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,400
online and stuff, but you can't actually play games against people.

208
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:15,880
But silver is all you need to connect to play online and then you pay Sony to do

209
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,960
It's just like Windows XP. In a way.

210
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,080
Yeah, you can get online but you can't do shit until you actually buy the real stuff.

211
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,040
I think we're gonna see a lot of connectivity between

212
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,120
Windows Vista especially and the Xbox 360.

213
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,920
I think it's just very natural that Microsoft is going to try and interlink all that

214
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,880
best we can. Of course, absolutely. Well, they're already trying to link the

215
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,880
Media Center Edition 2005 because all the ads for like the Gateway

216
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,720
machines coming out with that are listing. If you look at the bottom it says

217
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,320
compatible with Xbox 360.

218
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,120
Well, you know I saw some link on the internet somewhere where you can link your Mac

219
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,680
to the Xbox 360 now. Yeah, connect 360.

220
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,080
Yeah, something like that. So I was going to check that out for my new little lappy

221
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,720
Laptop Mr. iBook. But yeah, I'm probably gonna get back into Final Fantasy 11. At least,

222
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,320
I'm gonna try it and see if I can rediscover my love for the game, because

223
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,640
you know I left the game because the guild selling thing got out of control

224
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,840
and they banned all those people, so

225
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,760
I'm gonna give it another shot. We're gonna try... I am really curious about

226
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,920
this expansion that's coming out for Final Fantasy 11, The Treasures of Odd Oregon,

227
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,720
especially because now they have the puppet master class, which looks pretty

228
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,560
cool. They just added this week, announced

229
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,080
Blue Mage, and Shane's really excited about being a pirate.

230
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,520
So, uh, he's trying to convince me to get back into it.

231
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,580
Or Corsair, sorry. He's trying to convince me to get back into it, and I'm like, oh, okay.

232
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,480
What?

233
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,880
Buck Pirate, Rectal Buccaneer.

234
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,080
Shut up.

235
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,080
Anything else?

236
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,180
Alright, uh, let's see, my gaming week.

237
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,480
Um, I've been playing a little bit of Xbox 360, uh, Loki loaned me some games.

238
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,980
I was playing Perfect Dark Zero, which I just, I'm sorry, I couldn't get into it.

239
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:49,680
I see why people really enjoy this game. I mean, as far as first-person shooters go,

240
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,380
it is pretty intricate and a lot of fun.

241
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:55,940
But for me, no, it wasn't doing it for me so I don't think I'm really gonna play

242
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,820
through it much more.

243
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:01,620
Ridge Racer 6, pretty cool, pretty cool. I suck at it,

244
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:06,500
but it's really pretty looking. For me, see, I enjoy the destruction when

245
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,660
it comes to car games. I love

246
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,420
me some destruction, so I think I'm gonna be back to full auto and burnout.

247
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,580
But Ridge Racer was kinda fun, and I guess there's a demo on

248
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:17,860
360 now if you want to check this out. Yeah, there's a demo on Xbox Live. Very cool.

249
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:22,540
And one game I got back into it was a game I bought when I finally got my

250
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,320
Xbox 360 but never really played a lot of,

251
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,500
Cameo. And I'm starting to like this game a little more than when I first played it

252
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,100
because

253
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,340
the first time I played it, it was all like really overwhelming to me, like that

254
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,160
first level that you have to go through.

255
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,260
But once you beat that level, like there's a story event that happens that

256
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:40,820
kinda

257
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:45,540
makes you start again from scratch, and so I felt that was kinda a better way to

258
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,080
kind of start the game for me was kind of learning everything from scratch you

259
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,700
know what I mean it was easier for me to get into when it why wasn't like

260
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,980
overwhelmed with everything at once but to the game's credit it's got a pretty

261
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:59,900
good help system in it like you can always ask your little like it's just

262
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,600
like in Zelda you know how that fairy follows you and you can always ask the

263
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,540
fairy for help well in this one it's a little dude that's like in the book and

264
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:10,460
you can always ask the book for help so you know it helps idiots only find their

265
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:15,300
way through partners in time oh I'm sure a lot a lot of games adapt the same idea

266
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:21,860
now so and so I'm enjoying that game and just other stuff on xbox live arcade I

267
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:25,300
have probably downloaded damn near every game they offer on xbox live arcade it's

268
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,580
kind of sad not everything I didn't get back em in her heart saying that crap

269
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:33,540
but I did get I got bejeweled why did I buy pitch why I don't know why I just I

270
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:37,300
were I know cuz I'm a sucker and I wanted to play it in pretty pretty HD

271
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,340
and maybe get cuz I I I wanted to see if I get some more achievement points but

272
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,580
here's the thing but jeweled has harder achievement points and like any game

273
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:50,640
I've seen on Xbox Live Arcade seriously you have to be a bejeweled master to get achievement points in that game

274
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:57,120
It's sick the best bet for achievement points, and I was reading they actually have this article. That's on GameSpot right now

275
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:05,340
It's how to score 6,000 easy achievement points, and it's sports games or where you get the freaking easy ass points

276
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,560
Yeah, yeah

277
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:13,460
I'm going to a chat room www.orinslawandtrader.com click on chat reading some feedback here in the chat room

278
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:18,560
let's see GK 128 says cameo is terrible

279
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,380
I don't know if I'd call it terrible is

280
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,400
it is it as good as Zelda hell no is it

281
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,920
even as good as fable probably not but

282
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,700
is it entertaining for me for a little

283
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,840
while yes is it worth 60 bucks no it's

284
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,100
not $60 it's 50 now right it was always

285
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,960
50 yeah was it okay yeah I really like

286
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,400
that people say something is terrible

287
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,380
without stating why well you know I'm

288
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,840
sure it's a terrible game because the

289
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:47,020
The story line is retarded and I don't like the game and it's too happy.

290
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,420
Why is the story line retarded?

291
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:52,920
The story line is retarded because it revolves around this stupid fairy that freaking kidnaps

292
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,880
your parents or whatever and you have to use these gems.

293
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,520
That just illustrates something to me.

294
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,520
What?

295
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:04,640
That when people say, oh this sucks, say specifically why so that people have some idea what you're

296
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,640
talking about.

297
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,200
You know what, some of the dialogue in the game is a little lame.

298
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,920
Like they have these real lame jokes, like the old guy in the book and the little witch

299
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,880
with one eye or whatever have this little back and forth thing going on.

300
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,160
But it's really like canned humor.

301
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,880
It's like canned sitcom laughter type jokes.

302
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,980
It's pretty bad.

303
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:28,040
So honestly you put a game like Cameo next to a Zelda or next to a better type of adventure

304
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,000
game and it is kind of sad.

305
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,920
But you have to remember it's a launch title.

306
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,760
And launch titles usually, unless you're Nintendo, aren't your best games.

307
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:43,260
You know, one of my favorite games ever that was a launch title was Jumping Flash on PlayStation.

308
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,760
Oh, I don't even remember that.

309
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,760
It's a little mechanical rabbit, and I played the hell out of the demo.

310
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,760
Well, here's the thing about Cameo. Cameo is more like Spyro than it is like Zelda.

311
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,760
They were trying to position it to be like a Zelda killer, and no.

312
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,760
Well, isn't it more like the Banjo-Kazooie or Banjo-Tooie or whatever?

313
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,760
Exactly, yeah.

314
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,360
Which was just made to exist not necessarily be good

315
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,720
Well, the one thing that they need to keep in mind is that when you're trying to come up with a game that's gonna go

316
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,900
against the big names they

317
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:21,720
Not only do they have quality to worry about they also have reputation to worry about and I'm sorry

318
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,960
Nothing's gonna really dethrone the Zelda franchise the Final Fantasy franchise

319
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,520
fantasy star

320
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,120
besides itself

321
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:35,180
There was actually I was reading in the chairman before the show started a lot of hate going around for Final Fantasy crystal chronicles

322
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:40,440
which you know was a radical departure from the Final Fantasy franchise and you know kind of I

323
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:47,400
Don't think the GameCube was the best system for that game. It's human nature for to just hate on whatever is different

324
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,240
I don't think anything with Final Fantasy and the word crystal and it should be ever, you know

325
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,200
Made available because or mystic in the title

326
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,200
Yeah, I'm thinking about Mystic Quest.

327
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,200
Any quest in the title of a Final Fantasy game?

328
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,200
Didn't they call Final Fantasy Mystic Quest in Japan Final Fantasy USA?

329
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,200
Because that just, I could've sworn I read that somewhere and I'm like, that just makes us look bad.

330
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,200
I tried playing, well, then again, our Super Mario 2 was out over there, Super Mario USA.

331
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,200
But it had already existed over there in, what, Doki Doki Panic, right?

332
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,200
Yeah.

333
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,200
But differently, you know.

334
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,200
But it wasn't Mario.

335
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,200
Yeah.

336
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,200
It's amazing what a little Italian plumber can do for your game, huh?

337
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:31,080
But also keep in mind that a lot of times when we get the RPGs over here, they repackage

338
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:36,440
it for Japan as the international version because it's got more stuff in it.

339
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,880
Square does that an awful lot, I think about 10 and all that stuff, yeah, absolutely.

340
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,080
Alright, let's get into some gaming news.

341
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,680
That's what we're here to do, let you guys know what's going on in the gaming world and

342
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,680
bitch about it.

343
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,520
Loki, we're going to start off with you tonight.

344
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,840
Here's something some PSP owners might bitch about.

345
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,840
What do you think?

346
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,360
They redesigned the PSP.

347
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,200
Not surprising, actually it's something we've been talking about for weeks now.

348
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:04,440
And it's just kind of, you know, I don't know, not very surprising.

349
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,040
Basically this comes from Any Cool News.

350
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:11,320
It's this guy, Joseph Merrick, who's saying that he's got the insider information about

351
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:17,120
their new PSP system, including that it's going to be a more sleeker, slimmed down version

352
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:24,200
of the PSP, including a 4GB flash drive and a digital camera.

353
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,940
No word on what the price is going to be.

354
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,240
How Nintendo of them is all I can think of.

355
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,820
But it's supposed to be released around Christmas.

356
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:36,120
Is this Sony doing a knee-jerk reaction to the insanity of the DS Lite in Japan?

357
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:45,000
I think so, but here's the thing about the PSP, I don't see, unless you're pirating

358
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,560
games to the memory stick. I don't know why you would need more than a gig. I mean, unless

359
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,680
you're dumping a lot of stuff on there. Four gigs. They're trying to make it...

360
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,180
Well wait, if it comes with a digital camera, then they're trying, you know, it's going

361
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:00,740
to be a camera device too. Well I hope the camera doesn't suck. What

362
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:05,640
actually I heard there was like a cell phone camera that they had in their Sony Ericsson

363
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,320
camera is what they're being used, going to use for it.

364
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,480
Which will be VGA. The problem, the problem though with the camera

365
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:16,800
initially when they were showing it off, I guess, was that the camera was where the PSP

366
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,520
logo is right now.

367
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:24,400
In other words, it's facing the user, so it would be used as like a webcam.

368
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,800
We're watching you.

369
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:31,040
Which is kind of stupid, but obviously I'm sure that's going to be fixed later on.

370
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,360
I don't see the real need for this.

371
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,080
I mean, a 4 gig hard drive in there as well.

372
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,440
Is it going to be a hard drive or flash?

373
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,440
Flash.

374
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:46,360
probably a micro drive or something like that micro drive is hard drive well whatever it's nan flash

375
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:51,560
drive there okay okay that makes more sense because adding another rotating media just sucks more

376
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:58,600
battery life exactly so i don't know it's interesting it's supposed to come out you know sometime

377
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,360
around christmas hopefully the ps3 will be coming out at the same time because i hear they're having

378
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:08,440
a lot of trouble with that so yeah are they going to do different colors and all that stuff oh i'm

379
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,640
Sure, I'm sure they'll do it. I mean what they have white and black right now. They'll probably come out with some

380
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:18,040
Other colors that you can get blue pink, you know

381
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:23,320
I've been a little tough on the PSP lately, but it does sound like there are some good new stuff coming out for it

382
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,320
So that's that's kind of especially that game wise

383
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:31,960
Hopefully with this new PSP will come over the second goddamn analog stick like they friggin need on this thing

384
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,440
I would really change it that radically

385
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:39,000
Because now me having a first-gen PSP who's not really interested in upgrading,

386
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,680
I'd be totally screwed if games started supporting it. It's just like the whole Xbox 360 hard drive thing.

387
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:48,340
If you've got a core with no hard drive, you're gonna get screwed in some of these later releases when people require it.

388
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,840
So what? Here's the thing.

389
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,040
I mean, look at the games that came out for the late PlayStation stuff.

390
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:57,040
They supported only the DualShock 2. If you didn't buy a DualShock controller, you're fucked.

391
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,540
Oh well, that's gonna be the case with this.

392
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:03,240
They needed to have a goddamn second analog stick on this

393
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:08,200
because you try, you know, controlling, I don't know, let's say for example in Katamari,

394
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,120
you try controlling your Katamari with the four buttons, doesn't work, it's not as good

395
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,120
as an analog stick.

396
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,120
They need another analog stick on there because it'll just be so much better for a lot, especially

397
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,080
if they're first person shooter games that they have coming out for this, it'd be a whole

398
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,360
lot better.

399
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,600
Let's move on to another story here, another big Sony title.

400
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,200
It's not being made by Sony, but it will be on your Playstation 2 at some point.

401
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:37,820
Final Fantasy XII is coming out, I believe this week in Japan, very, very soon here,

402
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:42,980
and Famitsu Magazine, of course this huge, huge gaming magazine in Japan, often known

403
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:50,060
for its very strict reviews, very few games have ever gotten a perfect 40 out of 40 score.

404
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:54,720
The only games that have ever gotten this, The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, Soul

405
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:01,400
The original one on Dreamcast, Vagrant Story, Zelda the Wind Waker, and Nintendogs have

406
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,280
only ever gotten a perfect 40 out of 40.

407
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:08,720
Well now, Final Fantasy XII joins that little exclusive club there, getting a perfect score

408
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,080
from Famitsu Magazine.

409
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,720
I have to admit, I'm actually not surprised about Final Fantasy XII getting a 40, because

410
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,640
it seems like it's going to be a very incredibly comprehensive game that's going to give many

411
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,040
fanboys much satisfaction.

412
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:24,480
I was more surprised, I never realized Nintendogs got a 40 out of 40, and I was kind of like,

413
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:30,760
That's a little surprising have they played vagrant story because it's not that great of a game well

414
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:35,080
But maybe we have that whole audience in Japan versus audience in the US

415
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:41,820
No, I played vagrant story. I have a per I like the Japanese games, and it wasn't that good well

416
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:46,200
Famitsu begs to differ with you, so anyway of course this score is now

417
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,080
Just building more and more excitement amongst the fanboys that you know OMG this game's coming out soon

418
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,040
Wait, do you know when Final Fantasy XII slated for the US?

419
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,040
I can't even remember.

420
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,040
It keeps getting juggled around.

421
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,040
It doesn't have a date.

422
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,600
I think it's eventually.

423
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,200
So like when Advent Children comes out?

424
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,200
Like around that same time?

425
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,200
Around the same time.

426
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,200
No, no.

427
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,200
You know that's the same time we get the PS3.

428
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,760
Advent Children is in April.

429
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,760
Before the apocalypse.

430
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,760
Oh, okay.

431
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,760
That's good.

432
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,880
Well, obviously before Christmas, right?

433
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,680
It's got to come out before Christmas.

434
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,960
So we know at least that.

435
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,960
But Christmas, what year?

436
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,960
What decade?

437
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,960
Shut up.

438
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,960
Shut up.

439
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,960
Alright, let's move on to another story.

440
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:25,640
Another very popular franchise would be, well, anything made by Miyamoto, so what's Miyamoto

441
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,640
getting?

442
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,400
He's getting knighted by the French.

443
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,440
I'm not sure if that's more of a compliment, or a...

444
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,440
Anyway.

445
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,440
Hey, now watch it.

446
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,480
We might have listeners in France.

447
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,480
Be careful.

448
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:42,580
No, actually, well, tomorrow, March 13th, three game designers, including Miyamoto,

449
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,880
are going to be knighted.

450
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,360
And don't ask me to pronounce the other two game designers if we don't care about them.

451
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,380
We just care about the fact that he's gonna be knighted and I had to laugh because I read

452
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:57,880
the story on Forecolor Rebellion and they have the funniest picture.

453
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:03,480
He's like wearing some 1-up shirt and he has the Zelda sword and shield and he just looks

454
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,880
like a dumbass but it's hilarious.

455
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,880
He's just so happy and childish.

456
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:14,560
I love Kojima though, or not Kojima, Miyamoto, sorry I was thinking of another upcoming story.

457
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:19,560
I love Miyamoto though because he's always so animated, like whenever you see him.

458
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,120
I bumped into him at E3.

459
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,120
Really?

460
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,120
That's awesome.

461
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,120
And you survived?

462
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,120
Yes.

463
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,120
And I survived.

464
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,400
You didn't fall down like, oh my god, my life is complete?

465
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,680
Yeah, most fangirls would have fainted.

466
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,640
I bumped into Kojima too, the year before.

467
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,840
How do you live?

468
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,360
I've been touched by fame.

469
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,240
I was a sweating little fangirl when I met Akira Yomoka.

470
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,240
That was pretty awesome.

471
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,920
because you're like, I'm a Silent Hill, ahh.

472
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,720
We were doing an interview that never recorded.

473
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,400
Don't remind me about the last interview at Konami booth.

474
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,440
Anyway, let's move on to another story.

475
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,880
Let's go over to Dark Sakura, who has

476
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,840
a story about the Nintendo DS.

477
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,320
There's a little program out.

478
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,480
It's a freeware called Pointy Remote,

479
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,800
where you can use your DS to control your computer.

480
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,360
I personally haven't tried it.

481
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:16,860
I'm not about to go opening up my DS or anything, but it lets you use the touchpad to select

482
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:20,960
icons to zoom in.

483
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,780
There's actually on one emulation.com there's a thread actually going on about it for anyone

484
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:31,200
who wants to check it out.

485
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,760
It looks like that it's still very experimental, they're still working on it.

486
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,860
It looks cool, it's a neat idea.

487
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,860
I honestly don't think that I would ever bother doing anything like that with my DS.

488
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:45,860
I don't think you have to open it up though.

489
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:49,860
All you'd have to do is just

490
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:53,860
reflash it I guess. I don't feel like doing anything to my DS. I'm still

491
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:57,860
busy playing Animal Crossing. Yes, my DS is a holy object that cannot

492
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:01,860
be violated by the hands of man.

493
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:05,860
It will be using the

494
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:12,340
the Wi-Fi. So you could actually, in theory, take it out, you know, and use it elsewhere.

495
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:19,540
So it's a good idea. It's a neat idea, but I don't think I would do anything with it.

496
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,820
They should, though, have a similar device, though. I think they could make a lot of money with that.

497
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:31,460
All right. Moving on, let's go over to Loki for some updates regarding Midway.

498
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:37,060
Yeah, some news on the newest Mortal Kombat, Midway, got some news actually for Midway,

499
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,780
Namco, and Ubisoft, so it should be good.

500
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:44,780
The first, of course, is coming from Midway's Gamer Day, and I was unaware that everyone

501
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:47,540
had their own Gamer Day, but you know, I guess they do.

502
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:52,580
Anyways, some of the titles that they've announced, they're coming out this year, the first one

503
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:58,900
being a kind of a portable game system title for PlayStation 2 and Game Boy Advance, the

504
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:04,260
New Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, which of course is a fun little cartoon on Cartoon

505
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,460
Network.

506
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:09,740
Of course, they've got to have their own sports licenses.

507
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:18,020
MLB Slugfest 2006, almost slipped there with the 2K6, which is going to be actually a budget

508
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:23,940
game coming out at about 20 bucks, so that's pretty cool for PlayStation 2 and Xbox.

509
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:29,700
And of course, they have some info on the new Mortal Kombat Armageddon, which is basically

510
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:34,460
going to contain every single Mortal Kombat character in the Mortal Kombat universe, plus

511
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,420
a creative fighter and creative fatality mode.

512
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,660
Just looks really cool.

513
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:45,020
And then for your PSP fans, they of course have Mortal Kombat Unchained, or Mortal Kombat

514
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:50,580
Deception Unchained, which is kind of an update to the original Deception game, of course

515
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:58,880
with bonus characters including Katana, Jax, Frost, Blaze, Goro, and Shao Kahn as well.

516
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,880
So that's pretty sweet.

517
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:06,160
And then of course if you're an NBA fan, NBA Ballers Phenom, which also goes with NBA Ballers

518
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,800
Rebound for the PSP.

519
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:12,960
Those kind of different take on the basketball games basically have to kind of become a star

520
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:19,960
in a week so you get noticed by both sports agents and talent agents.

521
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:25,040
What's kind of funny is they had one minigame in this that's kind of like DDR, you're dancing

522
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:30,360
with mascots, so I thought that was kind of funny when I saw the one cheat on that.

523
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,860
And then of course, if you're a Rampage fan and love the original arcade game, they're

524
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:39,720
making yet another version of Rampage called Rampage Total Destructions coming out next

525
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:44,240
month and what's also really cool about it, other than being able to play as George, Lizzie

526
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,260
and Ralph, you get to play 25 different characters on top of that, plus it includes the original

527
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:55,340
rampage game and rampage world tour that came out on Playstation 2 a while back.

528
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,500
Not a big fan of any rampage game since the original.

529
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:02,040
It's also under $20.

530
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,860
If you're not a huge fan of it, I mean at least it's not that expensive.

531
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,500
Maybe a rental.

532
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:11,600
Exactly, and of course their big title for this year is going to be the Spy Hunter, Nor

533
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,860
the Run of course featuring The Rock and with the movie coming out.

534
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:19,020
Isn't that risky because I don't see that movie doing very well but of course now that

535
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:22,580
I said that it'll probably be huge it's gonna be a good action movie put that

536
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:28,740
way I mean doom did pretty well it did it did okay okay well it certainly did

537
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:32,380
it certainly did better than House of the Dead let's let's leave it that way

538
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:39,540
okay and then finally a strange hold which is gonna be it's gonna be kind of

539
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:44,260
a I believe a movie and game tie-in type thing straight with you know being

540
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:49,420
created by Midway and John Woo so it's gonna be kind of a third-person kung-fu

541
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:54,340
cinematic game which is kind of interesting. Now all done with Midway

542
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:58,300
here let's move on to Ubisoft and Ubisoft is gonna have a ton of stuff coming out

543
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:04,600
in the Tom Clancy series. First being Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas which is

544
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:10,520
coming out on both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and the Revolution as well as

545
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:16,040
PC and PSP and probably current gen stuff as well, I'm assuming.

546
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:24,240
Of course, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon 4, which is going to be coming out on Playstation 3

547
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,340
as well.

548
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:30,920
And then of course a new Tom Clancy franchise, Tom Clancy's Firehawk, which is coming out

549
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,640
on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.

550
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:37,200
I've never really heard of Firehawk, so that should be interesting.

551
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,840
Assassin, coming out also on all the next-gen systems, one that I was really excited about,

552
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,840
Luminous 2.

553
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,840
Hooray!

554
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,840
Me too, very excited.

555
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,840
Woohoo!

556
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,840
PSP and Playstation 2.

557
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,840
Yeah!

558
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,840
Hello!

559
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,840
Thank you!

560
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,840
So that's pretty awesome.

561
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,720
Big kisses!

562
00:32:53,720 --> 00:33:00,080
And then a couple other things, there's Rayman 4 coming out on the next-gen systems and Playstation

563
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:05,580
2 and handhelds, and the new Might and Magic game, Dark Messiah of Might and Magic on the

564
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:12,980
next-gen systems and PC so dear luminous creators online versus K thanks

565
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:18,300
finally Namco's lineup which is pretty sweet we've got actually next month ace

566
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:23,340
combat zero coming out for a ace combat fan me and my Katamari coming out later

567
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:28,020
this year which is pretty sweet Snoopy and the Red Baron coming out fall of

568
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:32,180
this year which is gonna be pretty cool the only next-gen game they had coming

569
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:36,600
out this year is Frame City Killer, and that's been delayed numerous times. I think it's

570
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:43,040
now slated for around July, which is interesting. And of course Pac-Man fans will be loving

571
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:47,960
the fact that Pac-Man World Rally is coming out, a new racing game. Hopefully they'll

572
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:53,280
come out with a new Mario Kart unlike they did in the arcade. And actually I hope they

573
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:58,800
don't because Mario Kart Arcade, not that hot. Okay, well fine. And if you're a PZ fan,

574
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,800
Mark of Chaos coming out this fall, so it should be pretty sweet.

575
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:06,800
Awesome! Lots and lots of goodies coming out this year.

576
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,800
We're now in that period of the year, especially building up to E3,

577
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,800
where we're going to hear a lot of flood of just game announcements.

578
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,800
And I got another one for you guys, and this is kind of a duh.

579
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,800
I mean, we all knew this was coming, but Guitar Hero 2 has been,

580
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,800
for all purposes, confirmed.

581
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,800
Kelly Sumner, who's the CEO of Red Octane, has said,

582
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:31,080
has said, we are working on Guitar Hero 2 which will have 40 plus new tracks, yay, I

583
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,440
think a lot of us were waiting for that, sounds like it's going to be awesome, but here's

584
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:39,640
the part that's kind of interesting, he also says that there's going to be genre spin-offs

585
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:46,280
like country rock, metal edition, and possibly even doing a plug and play, like you know

586
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,080
how they have those joysticks, well what if you just bought a guitar, no Playstation needed,

587
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:55,480
plug a guitar right into the TV, that worries me a little bit, because now I'm going, uh

588
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,320
Uh oh, is this too much of a good thing?

589
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,820
Can oversaturation destroy Guitar Hero?

590
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,820
What do you think?

591
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,820
Maybe.

592
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,820
Depends on how they do it.

593
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:11,520
If they do it like, if it's exactly like Guitar Hero, you know, just as good, then maybe it

594
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,280
might work, but eh, no.

595
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,720
I'm kind of worried about that.

596
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:21,880
It's kind of too bad for Red Octane that Guitar Hero wasn't an Xbox title because then they

597
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:27,240
could be doing these expansions through live but I mean that's not I guess

598
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:31,160
PlayStation 2 doesn't really allow that same type of thing so I guess this is

599
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:35,040
what they have to do of course we've never have we ever really had games here

600
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,200
that use the append idea like they did in Japan with some of the beat manias

601
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,000
we have appendis well there's something that they can do this is kind of a

602
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,240
brand new thing they did it was SOCOM with downloadable maps you can actually

603
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,560
you pay a fee online I believe it's five dollars and you download the maps to a

604
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:57,200
USB card and if you have a USB memory card or something like that, then you plug that

605
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:04,740
into your Playstation 2 and it unlocks the maps and it downloads to the hard drive type

606
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,740
of thing.

607
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:11,100
Of course that's a lot of factors that don't really bode well, I mean the PS2 Slim doesn't

608
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,280
have a hard drive.

609
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,500
Everyone has a USB memory stick, not everyone is willing to pay for this and download it

610
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:24,100
off the internet type things so I don't know comments from the chatroom www.orangeloungeradio.com

611
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:30,540
we have a wolfwind shadow says do an 80s version on guitar hero winner and I'll be like here

612
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:35,120
rock power ballads with this guy just won the internet that's a great idea I would love

613
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:41,120
to see early 90s music as well though like I want my Nelson no my poison my damn Yankees

614
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:45,200
motley crew Tesla this that would be awesome

615
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,880
let's just get our here are guitar hero this target

616
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,080
Ted Nugent for sure hero condition heck yeah

617
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:56,360
all Queen where they have where they have one Queen song in the no we need we

618
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,080
need a

619
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:01,360
guitar hero j rock version to go out in Japan think we'll ever see guitar freaks

620
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:05,340
in the US and where do you know konami doesn't really have a chance now

621
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:08,920
I I think they blew it they blew it big time they should they should have

622
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,280
released it when they could have huh

623
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,500
They blew it big time. I think they I think they could still do it

624
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,300
I I have a feeling they're gonna try to they can still do it then they could try suing them again

625
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:24,480
We'll see anyway speaking of things Konami is doing Loki. You've been following a little bit. What's going on with DDR supernova. Yep now they're doing

626
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,340
location testing in Japan and

627
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:32,200
a lot more songs have been added to the location test including some of our

628
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:38,320
Old favorites here our new Captain Jack centerfold the 130 BPM move it remix

629
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:44,320

633
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,600
What the F is this?

634
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,600
Alright.

635
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,600
I thought that was funny.

636
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:10,000
Uh, was it, uh, De Capo by, um, Ace of Base?

637
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Which is...

638
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Da Capo, I think it is.

639
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Da Capo.

640
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I'm sorry.

641
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Yeah.

642
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Golden Sky by Smile Decay.

643
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Huh?

644
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
That's kind of neat.

645
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Return of Smile Decay.

646
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,160
Um, then of course more Konami original songs including Peace and then this little, like,

647
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:29,520
happy face thing, then all, yeah, by B4U, it's like a little squiggly happy face thing.

648
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:35,740
Then, of course, My Only Shining Star by Nayoki, featuring Becky Lucinda, which I guess it's

649
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:39,380
okay because you kind of slipped up on the forums and said, oh, we've actually heard

650
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,660
this song.

651
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:43,100
We have heard this song.

652
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:48,500
I can really say we've been asked not to play the song yet, so we're making good on that

653
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:52,580
because we don't want to piss people off at Konami when they've been pretty good to us.

654
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:57,100
But all I can say about it is that the announcer is in the song, and it's very strange.

655
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,400
It's let me put it this way it's like

656
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:07,160
Was it a deep 1998 with the guy in the background

657
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:16,060
Shouting the lyrics to a song. Yeah, it's like and it's exactly, you know, like your d2r really, you know for you type things. I

658
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:23,300
Didn't like it. I listen to the song once I'm like no I now key fans will be fine with it. It's a good

659
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:28,940
It's it's exactly 1998 or anything like that if you're you like that superhero beat stuff

660
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,140
great

661
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:34,700
Like I said before, you know the D to the A to the end

662
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:38,440
Yeah, D to the A to the end to the C. That's like how it ends right or something like that

663
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:45,300
It's really cheesy, but you know, it's whatever there. You know what there'll be people that love it. So have fun with it more

664
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:52,640
More songs though Balmani crossovers including some stuff from para para dynamite raved the superhero version and can't stop

665
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:58,540
falling in love the superhero version which are pretty interesting then extra

666
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:02,980
stages are kind of interesting on top of fascination max they also have healing

667
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:10,260
division by these these these starred which is interesting which is I'm sure

668
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,700
it's just another Naoki pseudonym honestly and then the one more extra

669
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:18,740
stage is chaos by desire returns oh that'll make people happy because these

670
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:23,380
Desire did like, you know, Trip Machine, and I think it was a big healing vision and all

671
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,380
that stuff, right?

672
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,060
So that'll be fun.

673
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:31,180
So I'm happy to hear a new healing vision song, and Chaos sounds good.

674
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:34,220
Just a fascination, Max sucks so bad!

675
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,220
Alright.

676
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:38,140
Well, at least they're giving you options now, you don't have to play that one.

677
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,620
But it sucks so bad!

678
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,620
Alright.

679
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,300
Anyways, so I thought that was interesting.

680
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:47,540
Well, we know that we have a lot of fans out there who grew up with us on the music games,

681
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:50,300
But of course we talk about all the games, we want to open up the floor right now for

682
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:55,140
your feedback and you can give us a call, we're on the Skype line right now, username

684
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:05,540
here's a thing that may be a toll call for you, it is not a toll free number, so please

685
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:09,940
ask the person who pays the bills if you can call before you do, so let's head on over

686
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:14,680
to the Skype line and of course we're getting hammered tonight and we can't always answer

687
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,340
all the calls, so sorry guys.

688
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:22,980

691
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:45,480
like i referred her to the show here and i just hope she's listening in is this a special

692
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:51,920
friend? No, just a friend in general. Okay, I had to check. Yeah, she probably punched

693
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:58,560
me in the face. Is she a gamer? Is she a girl gamer? Yeah. Do you guys play games together?

694
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:04,080
We don't live that close together. Okay. Well, you know, thanks to technology, the Internet,

695
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:08,520
you can play games across the Internet. MMOs and Xbox Live, all that fun stuff. Yeah. She

696
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:13,240
does RPGs, but I'm not much an engineer. All right. Yeah. All right, well, what's on your

697
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:18,120
mine specifically uh in video games this week well you guys are talking about like cars with

698
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:23,720
guns and things like that uh-huh like if you want a game with cars with guns like play bow mode and

699
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:30,040
rush 2049 i haven't played it maybe i will what what makes this game so great compared to burnout

700
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:35,480
and full auto and all that stuff basically think mario kart bow mode except you actually have guns

701
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,840
mounted on top of your cars and you're literally are shooting each other and blowing each other

702
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,840
Well, that sounds like full-auto to me.

703
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,840
Really?

704
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,840
Yeah, full-auto is pretty much the same thing except you get mines and all that fun stuff too.

705
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,840
Wait, he's saying Rush 2049. I thought they didn't have guns in it.

706
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,840
Well, he said Battle Edition.

707
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,840
Oh. No, Battle Mode.

708
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,840
Battle Mode.

709
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,840
Same game, just different mode.

710
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:59,840
Well, obviously this is a very popular genre of games as cars with guns and destruction is fun.

711
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:04,840
And I'm all for it, because honestly if I can take out my aggressions on the Xbox then I don't do it for real

712
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:10,840
when I see those, you know, old ladies driving the SUVs that, you know, can't stay in one lane and all that fun stuff.

713
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:14,840
Because, you know, in full auto, then I could just, like, when I see the SUVs,

714
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,840
duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, huh, rough points.

715
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,840
Why are you shaking your head at me, Dark Sakura?

716
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:25,840
Just because I had a mental image of that when I was in Roseville earlier today trying to go somewhere to eat,

717
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,840
and there were so many SUVs in the parking lot.

718
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,840
Let me give you the full experience, Dark Sakura.

719
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:34,840
Sometimes I'll play full auto and talk to a friend on the cell phone just so I can get the full experience.

720
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,840
You're so awful!

721
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,840
Alright, just messing.

722
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:41,840
Uh, Nintendo Maniac, any other feedback, hellos you want to say before we let you go?

723
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:48,840
Um, I'm not really sure if my MP3 Pro plug-in thingy is working.

724
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,840
I've only got it to work in Winamp.

725
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:54,840
MP3 Pro will only work in Winamp. It doesn't work in iTunes, unfortunately.

726
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,840
I know, I'm using Winamp.

727
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:05,380
Okay, yeah, um you you're not gonna hear too much of a difference this time at the 64 K. It's really good either way

728
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:10,960
But you know if you have it installed and you have it selected and ready to go you should be set

729
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:18,080
Okay. All right. Have a good one. Have one last question. Sure. Okay. Does it affect regular mp3s too?

730
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:26,400
No, not unless you purposely save your mp3s as mp3 Pro some programs like Adobe Audition will allow you to encode an mp3 Pro

731
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,600
right away but you're probably not going to notice much of a difference okay all

732
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:36,400
right have a good one buddy thanks for calling all right let's go to another

733
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:42,800
call here on the skype line hello you are on orange launch radio hello hi who's

734
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,800
this this is wolf wind shadow hello wolf wind shadow you're the one that wanted

735
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:52,820
the 80s guitar hero oh yeah I grew up in the 80s we did too and we you know we

736
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:55,960
were just talking about how old we feel tonight but that's alright you know what

737
00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:01,940
We need we need to add like old-school Aerosmith love in an elevator. How fun would that be on guitar hero?

738
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,540
Well, what's on your mind? Yeah. Well, what's on your mind tonight? Oh

739
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:11,860
Not too much just ran run into your show for the first time. Awesome. How'd you find us? I

740
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:15,220
just randomly searching for

741
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:21,580
Places that yeah you Skype. Oh, wow. Okay, that's cool. Awesome. It is pretty unique

742
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:26,820
You know, I'm gonna say we were and I'm gonna make a claim here and somebody will probably dispute that

743
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:32,480
but we were honestly one of the first online radio stations to back Skype instead of a skype line because we've been doing Skype for

744
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:39,420
A long long time and now it's really catching on but you know, we're happy to have pioneered the skype line thing

745
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:46,500
So, oh, yeah, I'm a computer consultant. I have it up on my website honest. Awesome. Well, you sound great

746
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:50,860
I should have guessed you were a former Skype user because sometimes we have first-timers on Skype that don't sound so great

747
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:57,040
But we're really glad that we we got random people connecting to our show. What kind of games you've been playing this week

748
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:03,920
Actually, not too many this week. I'm getting ready to go back to school and finish up my degrees

749
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,040
So the real real life's got to come first sometimes right dark Sakura

750
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,100
sadly, yes

751
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:16,920
How to accommodate life, okay. Well if you didn't have to be going back to school what game would be you be checking out

752
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,420
right now

753
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:21,960
Actually, I'd be checking out some of the games with cars and guns. There you go

754
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:27,200
It's a big thing right now better, which are you a burnout man or a full auto man?

755
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,640
Full auto hi any particular reason why?

756
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,440
not really just

757
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:36,480
Interesting because you actually get guns on your car in full auto, huh?

758
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:42,360
Probably something like that. Well wolf win shadow anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight. Oh not tonight

759
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,800
I'm actually enjoying the show. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. We love getting new listeners

760
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,120
So, uh, you know, tell a friend help support

761
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:54,540
Independent online radio. We love it. Give us money. Yeah. No, we're not asking for money yet. So

762
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,240
Alright, thanks so much. We'll finish every shooting in take care

763
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:02,600
And you know what write red octane and tell them your idea for the 80s guitar hero. I think it should happen

764
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,900
Oh, yeah. All right. Take care, buddy. Have a good one

765
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:13,340
All right. Let's go to another call here. Let's go. We'll pick up this line. Hi. You're

766
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:18,620
on Orange Launch Radio. Hey. I'm not asking for money yet. Hi. Turn down your speakers

767
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:21,940
because we're hearing ourselves pretty bad. Give me a second. I have to turn down. Sure.

768
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:29,700
Sure. We got time. All right. Okay. What's on your mind? Is it good now? I think we're

769
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:35,420
okay. What's on your mind? All right. I kind of joined in a bit late, but I heard Loki

770
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:38,300
talking about a song he just hated. What song was that?

771
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:41,540
Because I know it's on the new mix. What song was he talking about?

772
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:44,860
Fascination Max, right, Loki?

773
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:48,820
Fascination Max? Are you just trying to get me to hate you? I mean, I'm a Mac user. I love

774
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:52,460
Fascination Max. Are you just trying to get me to hate you?

775
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:56,300
He's a Mac user and he loves Fascination Max. He's just the anti-Loki.

776
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:01,620
He's got bad taste in music and in computing.

777
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:07,620
Well, I can tell you right now that Loki does not blow up in the presence of Max because there's one pointing directly at him.

778
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:12,620
There's one redeeming quality, the PSV homebrew. That's good.

779
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:18,620
You know, diversity makes the world go round, my friend. Sometimes we're just going to have to agree to disagree.

780
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:22,620
I think when Loki goes to hell, it's going to be like an Apple store.

781
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:26,620
Flat panel IMAX everywhere.

782
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:32,180
We've got to let you go, because we're getting some more sound interference, but thanks for

783
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:38,960
your call, buddy, and we'll slap Loki for you.

784
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,180
Don't you love hearing from the fans, Loki?

785
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:43,180
One more call.

786
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:44,180
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

787
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:45,180
Hey, this is J100Med here.

788
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:46,180
Hello, my friend.

789
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:47,180
What's on your mind?

790
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:48,180
Nothing much.

791
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:49,180
I just thought of this.

792
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:55,660
I just thought of this, do you think they're going to have a dedication to Captain Jack

793
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:58,940
on a supernova?

794
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:03,220
I don't know how they could really do it unless maybe it's in the credits.

795
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:08,280
I think that would be an appropriate way to do it or maybe they could even do something

796
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,000
with the background to the song.

797
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
In memory of?

798
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,580
You know, in memory of or something.

799
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:14,580
Will they do it?

800
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:16,280
I don't think they will.

801
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:22,880
they had other dead artists in DDR before like just older artists I mean I

802
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,120
don't know off the top of my head but maybe artists that have just were Ray

803
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:32,240
Charles okay there you go Ray Charles is in DDR and there was no real uh wait

804
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:38,120
wait is that was no no oh that's right just a couple here can you see how much

805
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:43,480
I listen I follow the entertainment news I SSJ a really only time here this crap

806
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:49,120
We have no idea no idea. It would be nice. What would you what would you do if you were Konami?

807
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:53,580
How would you pay your respects to Captain Jack who passed away last year? I don't know probably have a pre

808
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:58,000
like little picture before the pregame animation saying

809
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:02,360
This is dedicated to Captain Jack kind of like burnout revenge

810
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:08,160
Did they have yeah like that? Oh, I haven't I haven't seen it. No, it's there's a I don't know who the hell it is

811
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:12,480
though. Interesting. Who is that? Some guy, I don't know. Some doctor. They could show

812
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,800
his picture and do RIP, you know, birthdate, death date. I think if they did

813
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,160
something really lovely with the background I think that would be

814
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,880
appropriate so when people played the song they could, you know, why are you

815
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:27,600
laughing? They could do it like Pixar, where Pixar at the end of the credits has, you know,

816
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:30,700
babies that were, you know, babies that were born during the production of the

817
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:35,640
film, they could have people that have died in the production of the game. It's

818
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:39,000
really morbid but you know Captain Jack my soul

819
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,880
alright SSG100 Matt anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

820
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:43,840
Our profit margins?

821
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:47,200
rockser

822
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,920
nothing really I managed to actually get a sneak peek of a

823
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:54,360
of a video game a movie that's coming out soon what's this

824
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:58,080
it's called Staying Alive and what's it about

825
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:02,840
it's not that movie with John Travolta was it? It's not Staying Alive it's called

826
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:03,840
Stay Alive.

827
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:04,840
Oh, Stay Alive.

828
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:09,640
It's the one where the kids play the game, and when they die in the game, they die in

829
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:10,640
real life.

830
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:11,640
I saw a trailer.

831
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,200
It's not necessarily a video game movie.

832
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,580
It's more of a really crappy movie that they based around.

833
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:19,240
It's capitalizing on the violent game culture.

834
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,240
You know what it is?

835
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,240
What did you think?

836
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,240
You saw it.

837
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,240
What did you think?

838
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:26,240
Well, actually, no, I didn't really see it.

839
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:31,320
There was an old school I went to visit, and I visited the video game section.

840
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:38,980
They were giving them sneak peeks of the gameplay in the movie.

841
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:45,800
The movie itself looks like Nightmare on Elm Street meets Ring, because if you die in the

842
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:52,320
game you die in real life and then it's nonsense like that.

843
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:55,440
Is it something that you will probably want to see?

844
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,440
Probably not.

845
00:51:56,440 --> 00:52:00,880
Isn't that kid from Malcolm in the Middle in it?

846
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:10,040
No, actually I don't know, but the guy who was in Hebrew Hammer, I'm not sure if anyone

847
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,040
knows that.

848
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,040
Oh, Adam Goldberg.

849
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:13,040
Yeah.

850
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,640
Yeah, you beat me to it.

851
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,040
I'm just that good, Bugged.

852
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,080
You should know I'm from 17 years.

853
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:21,400
Yeah, but I saw in the trailer, this shouldn't be much of a spoiler because you see it in

854
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:25,400
the trailer, he dies, which means his role isn't that big.

855
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,400
Yeah obviously not.

856
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,360
All right, well we'll see when the movie comes out.

857
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,360
Much like Scream.

858
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:32,200
We'll have an O.L.R. at the movie day.

859
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,680
All right, SSG01 Hermat, thank you so much for calling.

860
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,120
Appreciate it as always, bud.

861
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:36,960
Have a good one.

862
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,000
You too.

863
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,280
All right, we're gonna close up the Skype line.

864
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,200
We will try and take some more calls a little later tonight.

865
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,680
Thank you guys for calling in and saying hello.

866
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,720
We appreciate it.

867
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,360
Let's go over to Dark Sakura.

868
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,400
Yeah, we had a story there about,

869
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,820
or no, I'm sorry, we had a call there

870
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:52,760
where the guy wanted to,

871
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:55,440
or I was asking, who was it, Nintendo Maniac 64,

872
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,440
if he played online games with that girl he knew.

873
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,240
there's one game that he will never play online no matter what, right?

874
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:06,040
Nope. There's going to be no online mode for Virtua Fighter, which actually I don't

875
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,400
really care about Virtua Fighter,

876
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:10,740
but I just thought it was pretty funny that they were even trying.

877
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:16,120
Hiroshi Kataoka, who was the, I guess, big guy behind Virtua Fighter,

878
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:22,200
told EGM, basically, that they tried to do it online by simulating lag

879
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,120
and timing

880
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:27,440
and that it wasn't really gonna do, that it changed the gameplay way too much.

881
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:31,420
Um, to quote, if we ever wanted to do an online fighting game, it would have to be something

882
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,340
besides Virtua Fighter.

883
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:39,540
So, maybe that's a hint at something else, but for right now, no online mode.

884
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:40,540
Aww.

885
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:45,320
Yeah, I don't know many people that are Virtua Fighter fans above all else.

886
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:50,720
Like, you know, I know people that like Virtua Fighter, but they also like Dead or Alive

887
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:51,720
or something, you know?

888
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:52,720
Mortal Kombat.

889
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:53,720
Or something about 3.

890
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:58,360
who are our diehard Virtua Fighter fans who have been since day one.

891
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:02,300
My bias against Virtua Fighter starts from day one because the game gave me like massive

892
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:07,200
headaches, and so I just never got into playing it too much and then I found my love for Tekken.

893
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,960
Yeah, I was gonna say, can you actually be a fan of both Virtua Fighter and Tekken?

894
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:11,960
I'm not sure.

895
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:12,960
Well, I'm sure you could.

896
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:13,960
The world's on it.

897
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:18,160
I mean, I'm not, but anyone can, it just depends on what you like.

898
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:21,120
I don't see why you have to hate one thing to like the other.

899
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:24,500
Well wasn't virtual fighter kind of the response to Tekken

900
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:30,120
Actually virtual fighter was out if I do recall before Tekken. Oh, I don't know

901
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:34,520
I saw that's something I saw on a TV show once. I don't know. It's like yeah

902
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:37,000
I was that I think a year or so prior

903
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,040
I was a real hardcore gamer when I was a kid

904
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:43,640
But around the time that PlayStation first came out and all that 3d was getting big

905
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:46,380
I kind of took a break from gaming for a while because you know

906
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:49,340
I was going into school and all that and then I kind of came back into it

907
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:53,900
But when I got my Playstation in college and Puzzle Fighter and all that stuff, so...

908
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:54,900
Wasn't Virtua Fighter Saturn?

909
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:58,260
Virtua Fighter, actually, if I do recall, was 32X.

910
00:54:58,260 --> 00:54:59,260
Wow.

911
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:00,260
Oh, I think it was.

912
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:04,100
Virtua Racing had the Humongous Genesis cartridge.

913
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:07,660
No, Virtua Fighter was on Genesis, if I do recall.

914
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:08,660
Really?

915
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:10,460
Let me do a quick bit of research.

916
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:12,500
I think it was either on Genesis or 32X.

917
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:15,980
I think they put out a crap version on Genesis is what it is, because there was Virtua Fighter.

918
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:16,980
Yeah, it was really awful.

919
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,980
Tekken didn't make it to the home until PlayStation was out.

920
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:23,980
So I still have a promo pack for my Saturn that has Virtua Fighter 2?

921
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:28,980
Virtua Fighter 2 was one of the pack-in games for the Saturn.

922
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:31,980
Right, with Daytona and something else I forgot that I don't play.

923
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:34,980
Christmas Nights? No, Christmas Nights was a mail-in thing.

924
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:36,980
Dark Knight in our chat room says,

925
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:39,980
Saturn first, then 32X, then Genesis,

926
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:41,980
but they're kinda going back and forth a little bit.

927
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,980
No, because the 32X version was out before the Saturn was out.

928
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:48,600
trying to figure it out right now in chat so I mean it's honestly it's not a

929
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:54,040
big deal because I I had a 32x no I will I would trade back and forth my Nintendo

930
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:58,400
and 32x with somebody and he had virtual fighter on 32x hmm interesting I mean I

931
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:03,760
have the game now on 32x but Zaku in our chat room legend Zaku says 32x is the

932
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:08,760
worst add-on ever would you agree no because of knuckles chaotic and Calibri

933
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:12,340
oh you could catch I think you can play knuckles chaotic on a game tap I want to

934
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:16,840
say they have on. I like Knuckles Chaotix because who remembers, alright, if anyone

935
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:21,780
is into emulation there was a game called Sonic Crackers which from what I

936
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:26,380
understand was the template for what Knuckles Chaotix became. Colibri was a

937
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:31,820
really cool game we played as a little hummingbird. Oh I played that. And the best home

938
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:38,900
version of Space Harrier apart from the re-releases was on 32x. Hmm. And

939
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:42,380
and After Burner. I played Colibri on GameTap,

940
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:45,460
made no sense to me at all. It's a freaky little weird game, but it's cool.

941
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:49,100
But no, the best versions of Space Harrier and

942
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:54,700
After Burner were on 32x. Alright, let's move on to another topic. I'm gonna talk

943
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:56,900
about the Xbox 360, moving on to a new

944
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:03,100
new platform. If you have a 360 but somehow haven't bought Xbox Live Gold,

945
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:06,300
you're gonna get your chance to sample what it's all about. It's coming up at the

946
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,020
end of the month, March 31st

947
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:10,940
through April 2nd, only in the US though,

948
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:14,160
sorry listeners in UK, Japan, et cetera.

949
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,360
Verizon is gonna be sponsoring this.

950
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:19,000
They're going to be giving Xbox Live Gold

951
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,440
to everybody for the weekend,

952
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:23,780
and also giving away one million points.

953
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:26,140
Not all at once, but you can collect

954
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:30,080
your 500 free Microsoft points, not sure how.

955
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:33,140
I imagine it's going to involve selling your soul

956
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:34,900
to Verizon in one way or another,

957
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:35,740
but we'll see when that.

958
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:37,740
It's an April Fools joke, look at the dates.

959
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:39,740
March 31st to April 2nd? No, I don't know.

960
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:40,740
It's right in the middle.

961
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:43,740
But they're advertising it on Xbox Live right now, so I don't think it's an April Fools joke.

962
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:44,740
The points are.

963
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:49,740
But they're also going to have some tournaments, and I know one of them was for Geometry Wars, which I think is kind of neat.

964
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:50,740
That's pretty cool.

965
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:59,740
It's interesting. I mean, sure, it's corporate, but it's nice to see something different happening and some little promotions going on. I mean, it's kind of cool.

966
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:04,460
Also, if you happen to purchase a copy of Ghost Recon Vans Warfighter, you get 48 hours

967
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:08,180
of free Xbox Live Gold, there's a card in there too.

968
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:12,320
But most likely if you, you know, bought that game, it would probably already have Xbox

969
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:17,180
Live Gold anyways, because it's one of the reasons you would buy that game in the first

970
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:18,180
place.

971
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:19,180
Alright.

972
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:23,340
Going to our chat room, who's of course still arguing about the Virtua Fighter thing, I'm

973
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:26,620
sorry if multiple people have said this, but this is the first line I saw that kind of

974
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:27,700
makes it clear here.

975
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:35,580
Spikepoint in our chatroom says Virtua Fighter Saturn June 95 Virtua Fighter 32x November 95 according to game facts

976
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:38,340
Oh, yeah, but I mean June to November

977
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:41,340
It was just when I had cuz I don't really give yeah

978
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:45,940
I grew up about Virtua Fighter people might remember it differently because that's a very close window

979
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:49,160
I know that I know that I played it on 32x before I played it on Saturn

980
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:53,340
But then again my friend who had a Saturn all he had were imported games, right?

981
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:59,120
Alright kids, I don't care about Vulture Fighter anymore.

982
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:05,200
Although Ryoma in our chat room says, I'll settle this right now, Street Fighter is greater

983
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,240
than everything.

984
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:11,120
There may be people that want to disagree with that, however I will say this, I am definitely

985
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:15,240
looking forward to Street Fighter 2 on the Xbox Live Arcade.

986
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:16,240
Loki when is that supposed to roll out?

987
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,240
Soon right?

988
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,240
Any day now right?

989
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,240
We're just waiting.

990
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:20,240
Is that supposed to roll out?

991
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:26,120
I want to say the end of February, but probably this month at some time, probably in a couple

992
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,120
of weeks.

993
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:29,340
Damn, I want this.

994
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:34,080
But you know, there's tons of demos up there now, they've got the outfit just came out

995
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:39,720
on Xbox Live, you can play multiplayer online, it's actually pretty cool, and supposedly

996
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:45,000
Ghost Recon Advance Warfighter is coming online at some point, and Battlefield 2 would be

997
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
good.

998
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Cool.

999
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,760
What's Nintendo cooking up, Loki?

1000
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:54,240
They're cooking up a new game here for the revolution, and this is actually a survivor

1001
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:59,680
horror game called Sadness, and Sadness is actually what's going to be unique about it

1002
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:05,000
is that it's not the sheer amount of blood that's going to creep you out, but the atmosphere

1003
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
and the environment.

1004
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,080
It's going to be a very gothic horror type of game.

1005
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:10,080
Cool.

1006
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:11,640
That's a good kind of scare for me.

1007
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:18,520
So think Silent Hill to an extent, because I know Silent Hill is pretty bloody, but definitely

1008
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:22,720
definitely things like, for example, they'll use the revolution controller, you can use

1009
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:29,560
it as a torch to scare away rats, or to slit the throat of somebody using the controller

1010
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,480
like a shard of glass or something.

1011
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,360
That's not gory at all.

1012
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:38,240
In the game you're going to be using objects you find around you instead of guns and stuff

1013
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:41,760
to actually survive, so that's kind of different.

1014
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:48,360
And also, there's also a scenario that will deal with having associations of narcolepsy,

1015
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:55,680
necrophobia, and paranoid schizophrenia, which, by the way, kind of ties in with this other

1016
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:58,400
thing that has to do with Nintendo.

1017
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:04,920
And that would be a patent for a sanity engine, a sanity system for a video game.

1018
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:11,740
And it has to do with basically different, you know, computations to control, you know,

1019
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:15,220
the sanity of your character or, you know, like a meter for it.

1020
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:16,220
That actually was done.

1021
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:21,840
The Call of Cthulhu game had something like that, where you would start hallucinating

1022
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:26,720
and start a- What was that GameCube game that had that?

1023
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:27,720
Eternal Darkness?

1024
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:28,720
Yeah.

1025
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:29,720
Exactly.

1026
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:31,280
So yeah, this isn't something that's new.

1027
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:34,200
There must be a twist to it or something that we're just not getting right now until we

1028
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:39,680
It's just something else that's just kind of cool right now. This was revolution or GameCube. I missed that. It's just a Nintendo

1029
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,920
Oh, the game was for the revolution

1030
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:43,360
Okay

1031
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:49,260
Because I was gonna say sadness is what a lot of GameCube owners are feeling right now honestly because especially with Zelda Q

1032
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:54,660
Because Zelda is really the only thing left to look forward to on GameCube, right or am I like totally off parties?

1033
01:01:56,240 --> 01:02:01,680
Come on sevens enough on it got me serious. There's really not anything killer coming out for the GameCube

1034
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:07,220
the only other thing lined up for it is the next Zelda Twilight Princess.

1035
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:08,880
That's it.

1036
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:09,880
That's it.

1037
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:14,020
Don't get me wrong, I love me some Nintendo, but I think the GameCube is slowly fading

1038
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:16,700
to black, which is sad.

1039
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:22,100
Anyway, let's go on to another story, and you know, if you play one too many of these

1040
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:26,220
survival horror games, you might just start going crazy and have to go into a recovery

1041
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:27,220
program.

1042
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:31,020
But anyway, the gaming industry, there's been a suggestion on the internet lately for a

1043
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:34,060
recovery program of its own, correct DarkSakura?

1044
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:42,380
There was actually brought up a 12-step self-esteem recovery program at the game marketing conference.

1045
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:47,220
Now this isnít for gamers though, itís for the gaming industry, because the gaming industry

1046
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:51,100
has been kind of one-two punched by the government a lot lately, so.

1047
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:57,520
So number one, promote the rating system, basically thereís a good rating system by

1048
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:00,700
the ESRB to make sure people know how it works.

1049
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:05,440
deserving of being the number one spot to evangelize the benefits of video

1050
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:11,880
games in fact it actually references a book everything bad is good for you by

1051
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:17,440
Steven Johnson but mom it helps my hand-eye coordination well this bringing

1052
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:20,760
in here it's like you remember when I talked about that article that I read in

1053
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:26,400
one of the psychology magazines last year vaguely I will just to go ahead and

1054
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,920
read this out video games involve video games involve data pattern

1055
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:33,760
and tracking multiple characters and multiple storylines, sustained

1056
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:37,900
concentration, complex problem-solving, they're interactive, they're not passive

1057
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:43,640
like music or reading, there's more open-ended gameplay. Also especially with

1058
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:47,860
puzzle games that that article that I had brought up last year was saying how

1059
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:51,700
those who played more video games had overall better problem-solving skills

1060
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:57,900
than non gamers out of their control group. Number three, do more quantitative

1061
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:01,580
research with leading universities to prove the positive impact of video

1062
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:06,460
gaming and qualify any negatives they need to share the good and the bad

1063
01:04:06,460 --> 01:04:13,940
number four publicize that history shows we never embraced new media this is true

1064
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:17,460
for silent movies radio pulp magazines comic books and every new music wave

1065
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:21,740
including Mozart video games are not the devil incarnate and not capable of half

1066
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:25,740
the devil tree our critics claim for them that's that's a quote from there by

1067
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:30,540
the way number five preach moderation and promote good parenting remind

1068
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:34,540
parents moderation and all things including video games is important

1069
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:39,500
you're responsible as parents to oversee this amen sorry what side is this coming

1070
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:48,660
from this is actually from next from next generation cool yes this is pretty

1071
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:53,780
cool it's pretty smart yep six benchmark against sex and violence and prime TV

1072
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:58,780
Prime Network TV and movies. I don't think video games have cornered the market on sex and violence. Amen

1073
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:05,100
I think it's funny that they showed a slide of David David Hasselhoff in a speedo. Are they suggesting that the

1074
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:12,980
gaming industry run essentially like a like like a political ad smear campaign would be try to run a campaign that says

1075
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:18,460
Games are not as evil as movies. That's kind of how I read that is that keep in mind that

1076
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:25,820
Is watching the the news how many violent acts do you see or hear about just watching the news true?

1077
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:28,740
But the politicians are trying to say that's all because of games

1078
01:05:31,020 --> 01:05:36,820
Again the facts are there crime has been in crime among youth has been in decline. Mm-hmm

1079
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:41,380
You don't believe me ask the Department of Justice. The numbers are there. All right

1080
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:48,180
7. Embrace the Constitution. We have a right in this industry to make and market our product

1081
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:52,900
in an unregulated manner. We should be talking about what our rights are. Video games are

1082
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:58,020
part art and part commerce. Both parts are protected.

1083
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:02,820
8. Lobby. Make political donations. Okay. That...

1084
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:04,620
Interest... Okay.

1085
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:13,060
Well, with other industries, if McDonald's can lobby not to subsidize the cost of produce

1086
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:18,500
to low-income families, then why can't video games do the same?

1087
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:23,180
It's like how we suggested a while back when a lot of gamers were mad at Konami over the

1088
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:24,180
future of DDR.

1089
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:28,420
We said, buy stock in Konami, be a shareholder, and tell them what you want the future of

1090
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:29,420
the company to be.

1091
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:31,860
It's kind of the legal way of buying stock in a politician.

1092
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:33,180
Yeah

1093
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:37,300
Kind of sad though that we have that capability is a strange comparison

1094
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:42,540
But anyway nine harness our best spokespeople have them talk about why they like video games

1095
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:45,960
Have basically using high-profile celebrities

1096
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:52,660
Benefits, you know just to bring different people in by seeing their favorite, you know

1097
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:56,300
Stars say oh, I like this game. No sadly enough

1098
01:06:56,300 --> 01:07:00,940
I don't want to mention this because I really hate the idea anyways, but you have the hip-hop gaming league

1099
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:07,540
I mean, most people, I wouldn't see them as, you know, really someone to focus on, you

1100
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:11,340
know, being the spokesperson for games, but you've got celebrities in that, you know,

1101
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:16,620
like Snoop Dogg and stuff, also like basketball and, you know, sports celebrities that are

1102
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:21,340
playing games and they have their own kind of mini league that they cover on their website.

1103
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:24,340
Might be something good.

1104
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:27,420
Number 10 was demonstrate the most creative games.

1105
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:31,240
Halo and Grand Theft Auto represent us in the marketplace, but we need to show people

1106
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:33,460
it's not all about guns and boobs.

1107
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:37,820
Katamari Damacy, DDR, Parappa, Donkey Konga, and Guitar Heroes are all games the whole

1108
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:40,460
family can enjoy and play.

1109
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:43,660
But a little guitar, or I'm sorry, a little guitar, a little violence and boobs never

1110
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:44,660
hurt anyone.

1111
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:45,660
No.

1112
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:46,660
I still think we need air guitar frees.

1113
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:47,660
Over 18.

1114
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:48,660
Hooray for boobies.

1115
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:51,300
That was a good album.

1116
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:52,780
It was Bloodhound Gang.

1117
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:56,020
I'm not that retarded when it comes to pop culture anyway.

1118
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:57,020
11.

1119
01:07:57,020 --> 01:08:04,220
In statistical perspective less than 20% of all games released are M rated a minority of the product good point

1120
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:09,820
Amen 12 be proud don't be ashamed to say you like video games. Just be sure to tell people why you like them

1121
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:15,500
You know you know I don't like that I run into this all the time at work

1122
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:20,140
You know I tell people that yeah, I do this thing on the internet about video games. They're kind of like oh

1123
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:29,020
oh really like oh you're you're like that huh i'm sorry to hear that i do you know what's weird

1124
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:34,780
i get more of a reaction from telling someone i'm a gamer than telling them i'm gay honestly i do

1125
01:08:34,780 --> 01:08:38,860
like you know i tell somebody at work i'm gay and they go oh okay yeah yeah we all knew that

1126
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:43,180
and then you know i tell somebody that i'm a gamer like oh wow you you you play games

1127
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:54,300
Crazy, crazy. It's the culture. I am a proud gamer. Amen. And you know what, there should

1128
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:58,840
be a number 13 on there. If you're female, tell the boys to piss off if they say you

1129
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:03,880
can't play a video game. There you go. Or just beat them to shit. Yeah, you take those

1130
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:11,040
platform boots and knock them upside the head. You heard that from me. Alright, let's go.

1131
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,600
That was a very good top 12.

1132
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:16,120
Next generations I came from, I tip my hat to that website.

1133
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:17,120
Very nice.

1134
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,120
I think it's next-gen.com.

1135
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:19,120
Very cool.

1136
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,280
I've got a story here.

1137
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:24,520
We're trying to wrap up this first half of the show here, but plenty more stories to

1138
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:25,520
come here.

1139
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,960
I want to talk about GameTap real quick.

1140
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:34,220
GameTap is now going to be offering previews and trailers on their service.

1141
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:39,040
It's kind of like a try before you buy type thing, but they recently signed an agreement

1142
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:45,720
with Strategy First, who made Galactic Civilizations, and this will allow customers to preview full

1143
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:48,120
versions of their pre-release titles.

1144
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:54,040
Sounds to me a little bit like the Xbox Live model, a little bit like the demos, but a

1145
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:58,080
very interesting way for the PC publishers and GameTap to find that harmony.

1146
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:01,080
Hey, I'm all for easy access to game demos.

1147
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:05,280
I think it's a great idea, so I tip my hat to GameTap as well.

1148
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,680
Lots of smart people in gaming this week.

1149
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:08,200
This is good news.

1150
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:12,240
All right, let's go to the next story which is from Loki

1151
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:19,960
Yes, let's talk a little bit about Xbox and the patch systems. Gotta love the way they patch games. I

1152
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:24,960
Hate it. I think it's a dumb idea the release games that aren't ready for you know

1153
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:30,160
The market because they have bugs and they do it knowingly that they have that these errors in the games

1154
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:36,880
For example dead or alive 4 there's a mandatory patch that's fixing bugs and adding no new content coming soon

1155
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:43,920
It's also going to you know help balance some of the characters, but basically the fix the save bug yay, and that's something great

1156
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:49,920
Oh guess what you know those demo kiosks out there that you could download the Xbox car for burnout

1157
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:53,900
Guess what it doesn't work. It doesn't work at all because

1158
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:59,840
It's broken. Yes. That's right. EA has actually said there's at right now

1159
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:04,920
There's no official date of the patch, but there will be one to fix the 360 kiosk car

1160
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:12,160
because it doesn't work. Very fun. Another thing, Ghost Recon Advanced

1161
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:16,520
Warfighter is going to be getting an update soon to add the Southpaw

1162
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:22,760
controller configuration and to fix the bugs in their save system that caused

1163
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:27,240
your save game to get deleted just like it did in full auto and in Call of Duty

1164
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:33,400
2. My question is why are they releasing all these games out there if it's

1165
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:38,180
constantly if these games aren't ready I mean for example even some of the

1166
01:11:38,180 --> 01:11:43,460
patches are causing 360 systems to freeze up it's just ridiculous seriously

1167
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:48,540
why is it that they're releasing these games out there if they're not ready for

1168
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:53,220
the market if you know they're kind of using the patch system as an excuse to

1169
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:57,400
get everything out there and so now we're basically you know held hostage to

1170
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:04,400
to it. I don't like it. What do you guys think?

1171
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:07,440
I definitely don't think that people should be releasing games that are only

1172
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:10,440
like half finished and I don't think patching is the way to

1173
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:13,920
like fix your game on the back end but at the same time I do realize that the

1174
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:16,080
occasional error is going to come up in testing

1175
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:20,160
or I mean the occasional error is going to come up that people don't find

1176
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:23,240
like you know people that find loopholes and stuff and like let's say they didn't

1177
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:24,880
know about this whole full auto

1178
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:28,800
people quitting make fucks up your life stats and what have you I I'm okay with

1179
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,480
them you know releasing patches to pick things like this in fact I don't think

1180
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,760
enough companies release patches sometimes

1181
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:37,000
to fix these bugs that are discovered but I I

1182
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:41,280
definitely agree that patches should never be the excuse for getting a game

1183
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,600
out on time is that all we can always patch it later

1184
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:47,280
here's a here's a perfect example King Kong didn't have any gamma

1185
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:50,960
adjustments to the game the game was too damn dark to play

1186
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:55,880
mean come on that tell that screams oh we didn't test this on a normal TV we

1187
01:12:55,880 --> 01:13:00,800
just used our LCD monitors that we have here at work it looked fine on that God

1188
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:06,000
that's just lazy extremely lazy and then they have to go back and fix that it's

1189
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:11,360
so stupid what can we do about it what we can do about is have these people you

1190
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:15,480
know with your wallet they need to take their time before releasing these games

1191
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:19,280
I my big gripe was with EA a lot of times because they release these games

1192
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:25,100
are just slightly better than the current gen console stuff, and yet people buy them

1193
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:27,880
like me because I'm a sucker and I will buy Burnout.

1194
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:33,940
But still though, a lot of times we don't know that these bugs are there until after

1195
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:34,940
you buy the game.

1196
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:38,600
It's like you play all the way through Call of Duty and all of a sudden, oop, my save

1197
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:39,600
game's gone.

1198
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:42,900
Hmm, that's a nice bonus feature that wasn't mentioned on the box art.

1199
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:47,980
So I don't know, I like the idea of patching it to fix stuff and maybe add content later

1200
01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:48,980
on.

1201
01:13:48,980 --> 01:13:54,140
as an excuse to release a game like Call of Duty 2, whose online multiplayer sucks ass

1202
01:13:54,140 --> 01:13:59,580
because there's so much lag on it, and they obviously didn't test it.

1203
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:06,820
Alright, well, if you have a response to Loki's little rant, you could always send us an email,

1204
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:10,320
and that was sent to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

1205
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,200
We love to hear from you guys.

1206
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:16,800
Every week Dark Soccer likes to go into our mailbag and stick her hand in the mailbag

1207
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,120
and dig out her favorite letters.

1208
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:22,120
And that is mailbag with a B, not hag with an H.

1209
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:23,120
Mailhag?

1210
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:26,080
Is Dark Sakura a mailhag?

1211
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,180
Just teasing.

1212
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:29,120
I say that I tease because I love.

1213
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,240
That disturbs me.

1214
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:31,240
Don't give me evil glares.

1215
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:34,400
I didn't give you an evil glare, it was a disturbed look.

1216
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:37,840
Alright, Dark Sakura likes to dig into the mailbag, she's going to do that right now.

1217
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:38,840
With a shovel.

1218
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:40,280
Are you all sanitized and ready to go?

1219
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:43,600
I've got the hazmat suit.

1220
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:48,360
Who emailed us this week?

1221
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:50,840
Lots of people, because I'm popular.

1222
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:51,840
Sweet!

1223
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:52,840
Attention rocks!

1224
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:57,720
Actually, our good buddy Roble pointed out a few things.

1225
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:04,840
That basically, not only is Xbox getting in all over the 360 thing, we now have 360.yahoo.com,

1226
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:12,260
we have the Colgate 360, and we have Anderson Cooper 360 on CNN.

1227
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:14,460
That is a brilliant observation.

1228
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:20,460
We need to launch Orange Launch Radio 360.

1229
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:22,260
Maybe that can be the name of our fan club.

1230
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:24,740
Oh, speaking of fan clubs, can I plug the new MySpace?

1231
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:28,060
Yes, as someone didn't do in our LiveJournal community either.

1232
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:29,060
Sorry, my bad.

1233
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:30,060
We have a new MySpace.

1234
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:31,060
It's brand new.

1235
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:32,060
It's different from the group.

1236
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:34,540
We had a fan that made a group, but now we have an actual user account.

1237
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:37,220
Like we're a band because we want to be rock stars.

1238
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:40,100
But you can actually listen to clips from old shows.

1239
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:43,620
And you remember Jaime's email from last week where she was pointing out all the good clips

1240
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:44,620
from older shows?

1241
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:45,620
Yeah.

1242
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:47,860
I actually put the Mega Man clip on our MySpace.

1243
01:15:47,860 --> 01:15:52,060
So that's www.myspace.com slash orange lounge radio.

1244
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:56,320
Yes, we know MySpace is where the internet goes to die, but if we can promote ourselves

1245
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:57,780
on it, hey, we'll sell our souls to MySpace.

1246
01:15:57,780 --> 01:16:03,180
I was actually listening to that the other day and just cracking up and my husband thought

1247
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:06,020
that I had gone nuts.

1248
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:10,060
The freaky part about Myspace is Fox is now using it to promote their TV shows.

1249
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:11,060
I'm not surprised.

1250
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:12,060
Which is lame.

1251
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:14,700
I mean, well Myspace itself is lame.

1252
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:19,300
Well they own it, so why not check it out, Myspace.com slash orange lounge radio and

1253
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:21,500
add us because we want like a zillion friends.

1254
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:23,140
Alright, sorry to interrupt.

1255
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:27,100
We got an email from DJ Ratchet.

1256
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:32,620
Basically just to go into if he wanted to thank us for reading the email in the last

1257
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:37,820
podcast but also asked a question about Kingdom Hearts 2 which actually did

1258
01:16:37,820 --> 01:16:44,980
reply to about the different summons wanting to know if chicken little was in

1259
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:49,100
the game chicken little has been confirmed as a summon in Kingdom Hearts

1260
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:54,780
2 just thought I'd let you know you know what I actually should be playing more

1261
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:59,980
Kingdom Hearts 2 but I have this issue with playing games in Japanese I can do

1262
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:03,700
it but then reading I have to sit there with my dictionary and try to translate

1263
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:09,460
the kanji and it gives me a headache so she said dick hey sorry I had to do that

1264
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:15,700
I say dick all the time dick dick dick dick dick dick dick I'm sorry maybe we

1265
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:19,220
should just cut that little clip and put that on our myspace I'll be good all

1266
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:25,460
right moving on dick dick why am I not thinking of that scene in space balls

1267
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:34,700
just just do I have to separate you two next up okay we have an email from and I

1268
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:42,620
have to scroll down to see who this from psychoon hi um this is about uh you know

1269
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:46,980
old school games is a big fan of the old school games like in the gameplay but

1270
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:53,860
lots of people out there are saying graphics over the games so I know it's

1271
01:17:53,860 --> 01:17:58,140
like they're saying oh this game sucks because it doesn't look pretty that's

1272
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:05,140
stupid uh let's see what can I a case in point geometry Wars well it's it's

1273
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:09,260
pretty too geometry Wars is a pretty game but it's not it's not exactly

1274
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:14,220
pushing the 360s hardware to its limits radio ever gone yet it's insane thank

1275
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:19,940
you then again so is Ikaruga and that was really graphically pretty you know

1276
01:18:19,940 --> 01:18:29,020
once in a while you can still pull up an old Atari 2600 classic on like GameTap or emulators

1277
01:18:29,020 --> 01:18:31,180
or whatever you want to use, and they're still fun.

1278
01:18:31,180 --> 01:18:33,140
Unless it's ET because that game sucked.

1279
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:36,740
Well, yeah, but they don't have ET on GameTap and I don't think they exist.

1280
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:38,900
I think Atari's pretty much written ET off.

1281
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:39,900
I have two.

1282
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:40,900
Sucker.

1283
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:41,900
Yeah.

1284
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:42,900
I didn't buy them.

1285
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:43,900
Did I?

1286
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:44,900
I was.

1287
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:49,340
But just to go ahead and read a paragraph out of this letter, it said I just want to

1288
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:54,340
to know why as many people now think that graphics are more important to a game than

1289
01:18:54,340 --> 01:18:58,740
gameplay. I actually played Sonic Adventure with a friend of mine and he complained about

1290
01:18:58,740 --> 01:19:02,720
how blocky it looked to him as compared to Half Life 2 and Halo 2 and he didn't like

1291
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:06,920
it just for that reason although Sonic Adventure was, still is, a great game.

1292
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:10,740
Well he was comparing first version to 2. I mean Sonic Adventure 2 wasn't as...

1293
01:19:10,740 --> 01:19:15,620
First of all I want to know how was Sonic Adventure blocky? Sonic Adventure was really

1294
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:19,780
smooth, very nice. I don't think, I can't think of any games on Dreamcast that were

1295
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:24,660
blocky at all. No, not since like the early Playstation games and even then it's like

1296
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:29,260
who cares, one of my favorite games ever on Playstation is called Evil Zone and it's really

1297
01:19:29,260 --> 01:19:34,580
horrible looking but it's so cheese ball we want to make fun of every anime in existence.

1298
01:19:34,580 --> 01:19:40,780
Well it's just spoiled by next gen pretty stuff, you know? You know, people, I think

1299
01:19:40,780 --> 01:19:45,940
I think it's just because we grew up, you know, with the we-have-nothing-but gameplay,

1300
01:19:45,940 --> 01:19:46,940
you know?

1301
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:50,900
That we have a better appreciation for a game that plays well versus a game that looks pretty

1302
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:52,140
and plays like crap.

1303
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:55,500
Half-Life 2 plays well.

1304
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:56,500
Don't get, don't get, I think...

1305
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:57,500
I can't play first person.

1306
01:19:57,500 --> 01:20:01,100
Halo's a pretty game, and it's a good game, don't get me wrong, but you know, don't knock

1307
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:06,540
Sonic Adventure just because, you know, it's not pristine quality like these games, like

1308
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:07,700
you kids have now.

1309
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:14,140
I will have to get off our game the US Sonic Adventure actually was a little bit better because the Japanese one had so many

1310
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:16,940
Glitches in it. Like I ran in I ran through a wall and got stuck in it

1311
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:22,980
Actually, technically I got a camera in a wall. Yeah, the sonic team camera had it has issues still

1312
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:25,940
in another dreamcast game

1313
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:32,020
Blue stinger I had the Japanese version where they'd had the big cinematic, you know camera angles

1314
01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:38,600
It's really hard to do that scene where you're climbing up the tower when the camera is like 50 miles above the tower

1315
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:42,480
Like oh yay. I'm going to pretend. I know where I'm going

1316
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:50,880
So next letter shy sure another one from Rob about Lieberman being the porker of the month

1317
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:54,480
Like fatty, I don't know

1318
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,840
Why did he get shot in the face too?

1319
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:01,040
Basically, there's an article on a game spot

1320
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:07,080
that are there proposing the CDC investigate video games you know what

1321
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:15,520
disease control let me I'm sure this Katamari game made me lose my mind and

1322
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:19,480
I've just gone crazy and I worship the king of all cosmos they want to look at

1323
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:24,200
the impact of electronic media use organized by the Centers for Disease

1324
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:28,440
Control and Prevention to go ahead and read a little bit of this article even

1325
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:32,560
of the legislation called the Children and Media Research Advancement Act does not include

1326
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:37,080
restrictions and appears to be intended as a way to justify them. That's because a string

1327
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:42,560
of court decisions have been striking down anti-gaming laws because of a lack of hard

1328
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:46,120
evidence that minors are harmed by violence in video games.

1329
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:50,600
I'm sorry to take that out on anyone. Your tax dollars at work, ladies and gentlemen.

1330
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:56,460
As like, they can't admit that they're wrong. They've, you know, how many times have we

1331
01:21:56,460 --> 01:22:00,580
seen all of you know the courts basically upholding what we've been

1332
01:22:00,580 --> 01:22:04,740
saying for ages that there's not really any type of major harm to come to it

1333
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:08,780
unless you're counting home environment but they're saying no no it's a video

1334
01:22:08,780 --> 01:22:16,860
games parents are not allowed to raise their children stupid people why is it

1335
01:22:16,860 --> 01:22:22,700
that you know I'm not even gonna go into it every I think really program I think

1336
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:27,460
everybody knows by now how I feel about our government's hand and things so I'm

1337
01:22:27,460 --> 01:22:31,340
gonna skip on to the next letter how's that sound? Sounds super. We have an email

1338
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:37,580
from Max in Melbourne. Okay. And actually this has to do with something Loki

1339
01:22:37,580 --> 01:22:43,140
talked about the Infinium Labs console, the Phantom. Wanted to add something in

1340
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:47,740
here I'll go ahead and read this. Best name ever for vaporware. Like

1341
01:22:47,740 --> 01:22:48,740
Melbourne, Australia?

1342
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:49,740
Yes.

1343
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:50,740
Sweet.

1344
01:22:50,740 --> 01:22:53,020
I'm going to go ahead and quote from here.

1345
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:54,860
I would like to add a bit to what he said.

1346
01:22:54,860 --> 01:23:01,020
The company spent around $62 million on stuff for the last year with around $3.5 million

1347
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:03,440
spent on the actual console development.

1348
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:06,240
This may be because the console is a scam.

1349
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:10,600
You see what the console makers or non-makers in this case could be doing is just getting

1350
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:14,140
lots of money from investors to say they're going to make a console when they actually

1351
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:17,580
spend very little on the console and keep some of the money for themselves.

1352
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:21,940
For example, they hire their family as consultants, pay them $200,000 a year while also paying

1353
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:24,340
themselves money.

1354
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:26,540
If you ask me, quite a good idea, really.

1355
01:23:26,540 --> 01:23:29,580
And Orange Launch Radio will be coming out with its own console very soon and we're looking

1356
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:30,580
for investors.

1357
01:23:30,580 --> 01:23:33,260
So if you have $11 billion, please send us an email.

1358
01:23:33,260 --> 01:23:36,180
Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com, we'd love to hear from you.

1359
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:43,340
I remember when they were showing the Phantom at U3, was it in 2004, and they had a booth

1360
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:47,420
and they were like, you know, I tried to go in the wrong exit or wrong entrance or something

1361
01:23:47,420 --> 01:23:51,420
and it got all pissed off at me or something, so then I walked around the normal way and

1362
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:59,980
then I saw their console that sucked balls and then I wish we were TV sometimes, I wish

1363
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:06,780
we were TV sometimes because Loki was doing little quotes there, quote finger balls, anyways,

1364
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:12,620
quotes around sucked, so yeah and I got a free t-shirt out of it though that glows in

1365
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:17,020
the dark and sadly enough, does it suck balls, I got a phantom t-shirt and used it to clean

1366
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:23,100
the bathroom t-shirt sucks um no the only thing i liked about the console was the case and i wanted

1367
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:28,220
to make a computer out of the case that was about it because it had this like glowing blue light on

1368
01:24:28,220 --> 01:24:37,340
the front and that looked cool but other than that it was like huge it was the size of a large vcr i

1369
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:44,060
mean this thing was ginormous it looked like a stupid brick any more emails one more one more

1370
01:24:44,060 --> 01:24:45,060
Alrighty.

1371
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:46,060
From Jaded.

1372
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:47,060
Hi, Jaded.

1373
01:24:47,060 --> 01:24:51,940
There's an interesting article that he wants us to look at about, it's actually something

1374
01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:55,500
on Slashdot.

1375
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:58,780
It's actually a really, really quick little article, so I'm just going to read what it

1376
01:24:58,780 --> 01:24:59,780
says.

1377
01:24:59,780 --> 01:25:00,780
Sure.

1378
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:01,780
Okay.

1379
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:12,340
Kotaku has a great feature up today written by James Wagner, formerly embedded reporter

1380
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:16,520
for him in the world of Second Life. He's now doing his own thing and he's got a

1381
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:20,640
fairly cynical discussion over the Kotaku site about the real purpose

1382
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:26,440
behind game previews in industry magazines. From the article, and this is a

1383
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:30,720
quote, but for the thing of it is, game magazine previews are almost uniformly

1384
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:34,920
positive even for the most undistinguished titles, so it unrolls

1385
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:40,680
thus. Publisher makes mediocre game, press reviews, I'm sorry, press previews depict

1386
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:45,320
mediocre game as being good or at least worth a look. Excited gamers read

1387
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:49,040
previews foolishly believe them start making pre-sale orders of mediocre games

1388
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:53,360
driven by preview press and pre-sale numbers based on that press. Retailers

1389
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:56,560
stock up on mediocre games publisher makes money from mediocre games and

1390
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:01,280
keeps producing more games like it. Hey Yola. Let's see maybe if we add on to

1391
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:07,840
that successfully we get E gamers discover independent podcasts F gamers

1392
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:11,560
get the real story from people who actually play the games G quality games

01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:20,920
inherit the earth hurry for us we are your video game saviors all right all

1394
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:25,160
right is that it for the mail yep all right send your mail to mailbag orange

1395
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:29,300
lounge radio calm Loki take us out of this hour you have some follow-ups some

1396
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:33,320
quickie little follow-ups to things we were bitching about last week yeah the

1397
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:37,720
first thing is if you're hoping for another NFL game by someone other than

1398
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:45,320
than EA sorry NFL extended the CBA and EA still holds exclusive rights to the

1399
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:51,600
NFL sorry and I kind of saw that coming yeah anyways the origami what is the

1400
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:58,200
origami it is a 7-inch tablet PC that runs Windows and it's gonna be under

1401
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:05,640
$1,000 only yeah is it a gaming system no it's not a gaming system it's more

1402
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:10,440
like a micro laptop type thing mine sweeper on the go hello

1403
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:14,280
actually and they will they did and there is a video file

1404
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:17,500
out on YouTube I love you to I'm

1405
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:20,640
where someone apparently leaked one of the their marketing

1406
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:24,120
demos I'll that they were showing during their little meetings

1407
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:27,860
and it did so somebody actually playing a game on it well see really that was in

1408
01:27:27,860 --> 01:27:30,240
a market it was on their viral site that they had

1409
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:34,000
I'm or origami project dot com and

1410
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:40,740
It was just a concept proof of concept it wasn't actually weren't actually playing a video or a game like because it was showing

1411
01:27:40,740 --> 01:27:46,700
Halo 2 and it was but then they would listen it there as a potential for the machine dark Tetsuya in our chat room says

1412
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:53,540
999 99 when you say under $1,000 that mean 999 dollars 99 cents. I'm a likely probably they're gonna sell it for

1413
01:27:54,460 --> 01:28:00,620
