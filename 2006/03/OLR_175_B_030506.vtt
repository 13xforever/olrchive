01:06.800 --> 01:11.040
back into some gaming news here when we left off in the first half we were

01:11.040 --> 01:14.680
talking about some parenting stories there it's about left behind which the

01:14.680 --> 01:18.240
chat room just ran away with and they're just you know everything left but got

01:18.240 --> 01:22.880
left behind part a their World of Warcraft news and now a piece of news

01:22.880 --> 01:28.080
It's kind of near and dear to us here at orange lounge radio because I think we've all been to this place

01:28.920 --> 01:35.420
This so I haven't you've never been to the Metreon. Oh, really never Wow my very first DDR tournament

01:35.420 --> 01:38.520
I ever went to is at the Metreon. Well, that's what our story is about

01:39.000 --> 01:46.400
Sony has sold the Metreon the Metreon has been known as like the Sony theme park in a bit of way the

01:47.040 --> 01:49.060
official Sony PlayStation stores there

01:49.060 --> 01:51.820
They have some other things there as well.

01:51.820 --> 01:52.820
Do you remember this dark soccer?

01:52.820 --> 01:54.980
Do you remember the Yumpop store?

01:54.980 --> 01:58.340
I think it was the Yumpop store with the oopsie oops I went to hell shirts and all that stuff.

01:58.340 --> 02:01.340
A store was badass, but then it went away years and years ago.

02:01.340 --> 02:04.660
I guess that should have been the first sign the place was going downhill.

02:04.660 --> 02:05.980
It's like a skyscraper type building.

02:05.980 --> 02:08.140
They have an IMAX theater in the roof.

02:08.140 --> 02:10.220
I saw an IMAX movie there a long time ago.

02:10.220 --> 02:11.220
It's awesome.

02:11.220 --> 02:12.460
They also have the Walk of Game.

02:12.460 --> 02:16.180
It was kind of like their answer to Hollywood's Walk of Fame.

02:16.180 --> 02:17.660
They have the Walk of Game.

02:17.660 --> 02:21.860
Well, unfortunately, Sony is selling the Metreon complex,

02:21.860 --> 02:23.300
and who do they sell it to?

02:23.300 --> 02:26.500
Mall developer, the Westfield Group,

02:26.500 --> 02:29.780
and the Four City Enterprises real estate

02:29.780 --> 02:31.820
company for an undisclosed amount of money.

02:31.820 --> 02:35.580
So Sony will continue to operate the official PlayStation

02:35.580 --> 02:36.740
store in the mall.

02:36.740 --> 02:39.340
But as for the rest of the stuff there,

02:39.340 --> 02:41.860
who knows what we could see going up in there pretty soon.

02:41.860 --> 02:44.060
Maybe Abercrombie and Fitch, for all we know.

02:44.060 --> 02:45.900
That would just be peachy, wouldn't it?

02:45.900 --> 02:46.820
Boo-hiss.

02:46.820 --> 02:50.000
no idea what's going to happen in the walking game just yet

02:50.000 --> 02:54.820
yeah but many of us DDR fans like NorCal especially with like fond memories

02:54.820 --> 02:57.720
of Medtron except for Loki who somehow missed it all

02:57.720 --> 02:59.260
it's kinda it's kinda sad

02:59.260 --> 03:02.500
kinda makes me a little bit clipped

03:02.500 --> 03:04.080
talk amongst yourselves

03:04.080 --> 03:05.320
alright the life goes on

03:05.320 --> 03:09.320
so uh... moving on to another story Loki

03:09.320 --> 03:12.600
yes you got some interesting uh... you you had some real great exclusives in the

03:12.600 --> 03:13.120
first

03:13.120 --> 03:16.260
part there about PlayStation 3 and Revolution what do you got now

03:16.260 --> 03:25.540
Well, this is kind of, you can file in a rumor of how Sony plans on combating the revolution,

03:25.540 --> 03:30.220
and the way they're going to do that, well, of course, it's going to be with the PlayStation

03:30.220 --> 03:33.080
2 and the iToy.

03:33.080 --> 03:37.900
What they're planning on doing is because the PlayStation 2 is already an established

03:37.900 --> 03:42.300
console system out there with, you know, they're still producing them and they're anticipating

03:42.300 --> 03:47.940
the price point is going to drop down to $99 in 2007. And of course with the iToy, they're

03:47.940 --> 03:55.180
anticipating that you'll be able to use this to create some really revolutionary games.

03:55.180 --> 04:00.500
Only problem with that is the iToy doesn't work that good. I know this from first hand

04:00.500 --> 04:08.500
experience. And let me put it this way. Wiping windows down and looking like a jackass while

04:08.500 --> 04:11.080
dancing on screen, not revolutionary.

04:11.080 --> 04:19.080
Itoy Kinetic was fun for a day, waste of $50 because my apartment does not light good enough.

04:19.080 --> 04:22.200
I mean, it just does not work for Itoy.

04:22.200 --> 04:27.900
And while I could go to Ikea and buy a lamp, I'm not changing the house around to make

04:27.900 --> 04:28.900
the Itoy work.

04:28.900 --> 04:34.600
And granted, you know, when they're showing off the Itoy games and they're against a nice

04:34.600 --> 04:41.180
white backdrop. That's the perfect environment for the I2Wipe. But most of us people, you

04:41.180 --> 04:44.720
know, we live in rooms with more than white in the room.

04:44.720 --> 04:46.920
Posters and drains.

04:46.920 --> 04:53.740
Exactly. Not good. But some of the other stuff that they're talking about, and this is actually

04:53.740 --> 04:58.320
kind of another thing that Xbox is doing too with their camera, is they're gonna be using

04:58.320 --> 05:03.080
multiple cameras to track movement. That's more something on the Xbox 360 front. They're

05:03.080 --> 05:08.160
using that in fact they also showed how they can render your face in there by

05:08.160 --> 05:11.480
doing a screen cap of your face you know facing forward and sideways and then

05:11.480 --> 05:15.680
render it 3d and they're also gonna be using that kind of as an eye toy or

05:15.680 --> 05:19.580
revolution thing as well live with this way it's not gonna be like the

05:19.580 --> 05:25.540
revolution no that's why it wouldn't be that revolutionary if it were just that

05:25.540 --> 05:29.880
simple this is all rumor this is not good enough to combat the revolution

05:29.880 --> 05:33.480
thing you know there's probably there's other things that are going to set the

05:33.480 --> 05:37.440
ps3 apart from the revolution as just as there's going to be things to set Xbox

05:37.440 --> 05:41.440
360 apart from it there's no need for these guys to all try and copy the only

05:41.440 --> 05:44.920
good thing about the PlayStation 2 is it's not going to be as expensive as

05:44.920 --> 05:51.880
PlayStation 3 comments from our chat room www.orange lounge radio.com we love

05:51.880 --> 05:56.760
the interactivity that a taping live on Sunday nights brings us here gs 191 says

05:56.760 --> 06:02.880
Itoy good concept terrible games. What makes you think that the ps3 x360 camera is going to be better

06:03.600 --> 06:07.840
Good point going back to the metreon story there earlier

06:09.000 --> 06:12.260
Somebody had said I'm trying to find the thing here

06:12.840 --> 06:14.840
somebody had said that

06:15.280 --> 06:20.800
Old tech TV shows had been taped at the metreon so it kind of further Oh Tomo Coon said dude

06:20.800 --> 06:26.400
It had tech TV shows taped there just to further add insult to injury to the whole you know tech TV is

06:26.400 --> 06:32.420
long gone type thing. X-Play used to be recorded, or before X-Play, what the hell was it called?

06:32.420 --> 06:39.420
Extended Play. Extended Play was recorded there. Sad. And now it's going to be just

06:39.420 --> 06:44.420
a giant Abercrombie and Fitch, just wait. Banana Republic going in there as well.

06:44.420 --> 06:51.340
Alright, moving in, I made all that up by the way. Moving on, EA we talked about in

06:51.340 --> 06:57.980
first half a little bit there the VP over at EA doctor I'm gonna say this so

06:57.980 --> 07:04.100
horrible Jens Uwe Entat foresees that there will be a shift coming within the

07:04.100 --> 07:09.940
next 10 years quote CDs DVDs and box games will be as antiquated as cassette

07:09.940 --> 07:15.500
tapes and vinyl records what are they going in favor of their double boo

07:15.500 --> 07:19.460
downloadable media this that they're saying that the downloadable media is

07:19.460 --> 07:24.500
going to be the shift there in 10 years there and of course you look at the

07:24.500 --> 07:28.980
success of iTunes and you think it's just a matter of time before movies

07:28.980 --> 07:31.980
start being distributed the same way heck it's already happening on iTunes

07:31.980 --> 07:35.900
some shows that maybe aren't even doing that successful on TV well I don't know

07:35.900 --> 07:40.460
like I'm thinking of The Office does really really well on iTunes and it does

07:40.460 --> 07:44.340
okay on TV but it does really well on iTunes so kind of you know it might be

07:44.340 --> 07:48.820
the future outlet for TV and of course independent vidcast and getting bigger

07:48.820 --> 07:49.820
bigger and bigger.

07:49.820 --> 07:52.860
Well now, why not the same model apply to games?

07:52.860 --> 07:58.180
Well, they're also probably going to start streaming the Direct TV tab that's going

07:58.180 --> 08:04.140
to be coming to the Xbox Live, your desktop there.

08:04.140 --> 08:10.260
They're also going to be having location free players for the PlayStation 3.

08:10.260 --> 08:14.480
Also you've got the news that PlayStation 3 in Korea is going to start doing direct

08:14.480 --> 08:18.640
downloads of games straight to your hard drive because they want to combat piracy there and

08:18.640 --> 08:20.640
and they're going to offer them at less than retail.

08:20.640 --> 08:26.880
So, hmm, and hell, we're doing it right now with the Xbox Live Arcade, just in a smaller

08:26.880 --> 08:27.880
format.

08:27.880 --> 08:32.600
You know, I went to a panel at Katsucon and I asked a question about this, and I practically

08:32.600 --> 08:37.920
got laughed at when people were saying Xbox Live Arcade does not pose a threat to the

08:37.920 --> 08:43.840
regular system of downloading games, and I'm thinking, okay, now I've got this EA vice

08:43.840 --> 08:47.400
president backing me up, which I need to point out, he's actually Electronic Arts Europe

08:47.400 --> 08:50.600
vice president so sorry clarifying that earlier

08:50.600 --> 08:55.160
that this downloadable games thing is going to be more and more of

08:55.160 --> 09:00.280
force I think so we'll see now one thing he does say that you know

09:00.280 --> 09:04.800
is is a bit of a interesting point here on Apple has kept their song prices at

09:04.800 --> 09:06.400
ninety nine cents per song

09:06.400 --> 09:09.360
and this is a low figure that kinda makes people in the music business a

09:09.360 --> 09:09.960
little bit

09:09.960 --> 09:13.400
angry here. iTunes essentially has a monopoly

09:13.400 --> 09:18.420
Dr. Entant seems to think that with so many consoles available, there's not going to be

09:18.420 --> 09:23.180
a monopoly possible if this model works with games.

09:23.180 --> 09:24.180
It's not going to happen.

09:24.180 --> 09:27.200
I can tell you this much, and here's why it's not going to happen, because you have all

09:27.200 --> 09:31.600
the major retailers that make a lot of money off of these games.

09:31.600 --> 09:34.080
Also you've got rental chains.

09:34.080 --> 09:38.480
If we all start streaming media, what's going to happen to the whole rental market?

09:38.480 --> 09:39.680
It's gone.

09:39.680 --> 09:46.480
You've got GameStop and freaking EB there, well, same company now, but their whole business

09:46.480 --> 09:49.440
is game purchasing and stuff.

09:49.440 --> 09:53.680
It's not going to happen because if that happens, they're going to lose money from all these

09:53.680 --> 09:55.920
different outlets and then...

09:55.920 --> 09:59.080
Well, what about moving with the seas of change though?

09:59.080 --> 10:03.440
Tower Records doesn't still primarily make their business off records in the sense that

10:03.440 --> 10:04.640
we know them.

10:04.640 --> 10:10.380
Blockbuster realizes that people like the Netflix model so they copy it you know and do their own thing

10:10.380 --> 10:15.240
What's to say that GameStop isn't one of the online services that decides to get it on there?

10:15.240 --> 10:18.760
I mean who knows this is obviously all huge amounts of speculation, but you know

10:19.320 --> 10:23.080
It's it's a good question to ask where will gaming be in ten years. It's an excellent idea

10:23.600 --> 10:29.600
Unfortunately those 28 hard drives that they were packaging with the Xbox 360 not gonna work okay, but in ten years

10:29.600 --> 10:34.240
years we're not gonna be talking Xbox 360 we're gonna be talking Xbox 1080 or

10:34.240 --> 10:41.800
something I don't know all right whatever way forget it all right moving

10:41.800 --> 10:47.480
on we got another story here several stories actually from dark Sakura since

10:47.480 --> 10:51.320
we had a little comment there from the Electronic Arts vice president over in

10:51.320 --> 10:55.600
Europe why not give our pals over in Europe a little more information on

10:55.600 --> 10:58.400
what's going on in their neck of the word woods and Jamie you keep tabs on

10:58.400 --> 11:01.800
that? What's going on? We thought they were gone. We thought we heard the last of them.

11:01.800 --> 11:12.040
Acclaim is back. Really? Yes, with a free MMO, actually. Oh. It's called Bot. It looks

11:12.040 --> 11:16.760
like it's all capitalized. I'm already bored. It's basically, they're describing

11:16.760 --> 11:22.840
it as a title that will appeal to everyone. Basically, you start off with

11:22.840 --> 11:28.600
adaptable upgradable little robots are supposedly really cute and there's a

11:28.600 --> 11:35.160
I can do cute story about some evil virus PvP capture the flag that kind of

11:35.160 --> 11:40.600
stuff but you are supposed to have these near infinite combinations of upgrades

11:40.600 --> 11:46.920
you know there was a game like this back in the days of the Sega CD called what

11:46.920 --> 11:54.680
was at robo pit which I have and I paid a five cents for I kid you not I know I

11:54.680 --> 11:59.200
think that I paid 50 cents for it at an EB brand new it also reminds me of the

11:59.200 --> 12:08.520
enix SNES game robo track yeah but at any rate this they're working on this

12:08.520 --> 12:14.200
there's actually a new a claim games website where they have there the beta

12:14.200 --> 12:18.760
test is up there to register for there's also a future title coming out called

12:18.760 --> 12:23.280
it's a martial arts MMO called nine dragons but if you just go to a claim

12:23.280 --> 12:29.360
calm it's the first link on there the first little image there I think I'll

12:29.360 --> 12:33.820
sign up for it it looks really cute I'm I'm I'm interested if it's cute I could

12:33.820 --> 12:38.240
do that well also I like that I like that you know nine dragons sounds like

12:38.240 --> 12:43.760
it has a hard edge to it well the actual site for bots is www.botsgame.com

12:43.760 --> 12:50.480
B-O-T-S-G-A-M-E, and there's actually, it actually looks pretty neat.

12:50.480 --> 12:53.960
This is funny, we got a comment in our chat room here, Ranma says, I saw the site for

12:53.960 --> 12:57.360
Acclaim's bots, it looks just like the Ragnarok Online page.

12:57.360 --> 12:58.360
It does!

12:58.360 --> 13:01.520
It's laid out just like a website for a Korean MMO.

13:01.520 --> 13:05.640
I love Ragnarok Online, so I think I'll give the bots a try.

13:05.640 --> 13:06.640
Alright.

13:06.640 --> 13:10.200
Ragnarok Online certainly was cute, and it was the only game that would allow my male,

13:10.200 --> 13:13.440
the only game I've ever played that would allow my male character to wear a bow in his

13:13.440 --> 13:18.800
said. I was hardcore. I still have that photo. It was my camera wallpaper. I was on my cell

13:18.800 --> 13:22.880
phone for forever. Anyway, moving on. And my character is like this badass assassin

13:22.880 --> 13:30.880
looking girl. It was cool. I miss Ragnarok. Um, anyway, uh, next up, uh, a comment by,

13:30.880 --> 13:35.920
uh, uh, Roger Bennett, who is the general director of a UK video games publisher, Trade

13:35.920 --> 13:43.620
E L S P A said there's complete and utter nonsense about a speech made in

13:43.620 --> 13:49.820
Parliament by the Labour MP Keith Vasque stating about new laws or relating to

13:49.820 --> 13:58.780
video game ratings. I brought this up earlier. Basically, GamesIndustry.biz

13:58.780 --> 14:04.100
was told and I quote, his whole thrust with this proposed bill was about

14:04.100 --> 14:07.900
labeling which he got utterly and completely wrong and that it hasn't got up to speed

14:07.900 --> 14:10.520
with what has happened over the last three or four years.

14:10.520 --> 14:15.180
Vaz was proposing an amendment to the Video Recordings Act in 1984 that would make it

14:15.180 --> 14:20.680
mandatory for video games to receive content ratings the same way that films do.

14:20.680 --> 14:27.500
It's a voluntary, the PEGI rating system is all voluntary to coincide with that.

14:27.500 --> 14:34.780
but he was arguing in Parliament that the current system where basically it

14:34.780 --> 14:41.780
sees the PEGI ratings being complemented by the what's it called the

14:41.780 --> 14:45.540
British Board of Film classification to go along the same lines but they're

14:45.540 --> 14:53.340
saying that's very confusing. Let me get the next quote on here because it's a

14:53.340 --> 15:00.900
very very long article that I've been digesting over this. But basically, it was going back,

15:00.900 --> 15:04.060
Bennett stated, the fact of the matter is that we're one of only two countries in the

15:04.060 --> 15:08.580
whole 27 states in the European Union who have mandatory ratings. Everywhere else in

15:08.580 --> 15:12.620
Europe these ratings are on the boxes, the PEGI ratings, and they make informed decisions

15:12.620 --> 15:16.080
for their kids. You know, parents are doing that. The more you take the responsibility

15:16.080 --> 15:20.540
away from the parents, the less responsibility they'll take. As soon as you take responsibility

15:20.540 --> 15:24.080
away from the people than they rely on others to do it for them the whole

15:24.080 --> 15:28.100
process is mindless in my view at the end of the day as long as the information is

15:28.100 --> 15:31.540
there we should leave it to the parents and guardians those to those responsible

15:31.540 --> 15:34.640
for young people to make informed decisions about what they should or

15:34.640 --> 15:39.860
shouldn't watch they blame the blame culture in which we seem to live these

15:39.860 --> 15:45.220
days as a result of the promotion that of the nanny state no question about it

15:45.220 --> 15:48.780
it's always somebody else's fault and they have to have somebody else to blame

15:48.780 --> 15:53.080
That right there is my argument.

15:53.080 --> 15:56.700
This guy is my hero now.

15:56.700 --> 16:00.160
Let's bring down the old OLR hero wall.

16:00.160 --> 16:06.440
I'm going to print out his photo at Kinko's and put it on the wall because I don't think

16:06.440 --> 16:12.280
it's ever been stated better than I've seen it in print there.

16:12.280 --> 16:19.840
And I really do think that's what it comes down to is that we have these figures in government

16:19.840 --> 16:26.440
trying to basically dictate, and it's not just here, this is proof, it is everywhere,

16:26.440 --> 16:31.920
trying to dictate what the people see, what the people watch, take responsibility away

16:31.920 --> 16:36.200
from the people, take away accountability from the people and put it in the hands of

16:36.200 --> 16:37.880
government to babysit them.

16:37.880 --> 16:41.520
you know what it's been happening more especially and I hate especially since

16:41.520 --> 16:45.280
9-11 it's been happening more and more where we've had our governments taking

16:45.280 --> 16:50.440
control over what they view as protection action whether it's in

16:50.440 --> 16:55.720
censorship of video games not just that I think more so Alma I mean certainly I

16:55.720 --> 16:59.640
noticed it then too but Janet Jackson booby Super Bowl hello yeah that was a

16:59.640 --> 17:05.360
huge you know shift in that what we're seeing is you know especially in and I

17:05.360 --> 17:08.780
think that's actually even more of a slap in the face to those of us in the

17:08.780 --> 17:12.560
United States where we're founded on these principles of free speech and

17:12.560 --> 17:18.660
human rights where we really don't have that liberal environment that we were

17:18.660 --> 17:23.000
founded under honestly you know the true there was a lot of concern a lot more

17:23.000 --> 17:27.580
what we would see as conservatism you know back then but you know you have to

17:27.580 --> 17:32.180
think about it we are a very repressed society and our government is just you

17:32.180 --> 17:37.260
know sort of pushing that along SSJ 100 Matt in our chat room just called OLR

17:37.260 --> 17:45.980
the no spin zone at any rate at any rate all right I think though that the whole

17:45.980 --> 17:52.900
especially with you know Jackie poo his whole agenda with you know seeing this

17:52.900 --> 18:02.340
come up I think it really is more of and more of a view overall that they're not

18:02.340 --> 18:06.140
wanting us to be accountable for ourselves they take the power away from

18:06.140 --> 18:11.380
the people and we're left just blindly following what they tell us to that's

18:11.380 --> 18:15.620
what that's my theory behind all of this I think that it all goes hand in hand

18:15.620 --> 18:19.420
send those cards and letters to mailbag at orange launch radio.com and that's

18:19.420 --> 18:24.220
just my opinion all right that's just my observation but again you know I find it

18:24.220 --> 18:29.420
very sad that governments are having to step in and tell parents how to do their

18:29.420 --> 18:35.740
jobs you know trying to dictate what you can and can do one more all right bit of

18:35.740 --> 18:44.140
European news is the PSP giga pack price has been slashed basically for any

18:44.140 --> 18:51.500
Northern Irish gamers hoping to pick up the PSP Gigapack, GameStop has slashed

18:51.500 --> 18:56.900
basically 25 pounds off the price. You can pick up the pack which includes a PSP,

18:56.900 --> 19:03.940
a stand USB cable, and a 1 gigabyte memory stick for $189.99 in

19:03.940 --> 19:09.020
Northern Ireland branches of GameStop. The game has also been lowered to

19:09.020 --> 19:12.780
289.99 euros in GameStop stores throughout all of Ireland.

19:14.180 --> 19:18.420
Outside, however, the price is still 214.99

19:18.420 --> 19:20.680
or in euros, 309.99.

19:22.580 --> 19:26.780
So, go to Ireland if you wanna get your gigapack cheap.

19:26.780 --> 19:30.440
Also, release dates.

19:30.440 --> 19:31.280
Oh yes, what's coming up?

19:31.280 --> 19:33.060

19:46.860 --> 19:49.500
On the 10th, 24 The Game.

19:49.500 --> 19:50.500
Wouldn't that make you happy?

19:50.500 --> 19:59.900
I've been bad at watching 24. I didn't watch any TV at all while I was on my little business trip.

19:59.900 --> 20:03.380
I was actually in Virginia. I don't think I ever said where I was. I was in Virginia.

20:03.380 --> 20:07.180
I didn't really watch any TV, I was in Virginia Beach in the middle of winter which is a great

20:07.180 --> 20:09.100
time to go, yeah.

20:09.100 --> 20:14.580
But I didn't watch any TV, except for The Apprentice, I watched The Apprentice once and

20:14.580 --> 20:16.140
it wasn't even that good.

20:16.140 --> 20:21.060
Well, for the rest of the games coming out, also in the 10th, Combat 121, Fight Night

20:51.340 --> 20:54.420
Wonder Dog Harold would just like you all to know that watching 24 caused him to have

20:54.420 --> 20:58.100
a dream of naked Jean Smart from Designing Women who plays...

20:58.100 --> 21:03.020
god she's on this new season so oh my god she still has a career yes she's

21:03.020 --> 21:06.580
she actually has a great room she was the blonde one I only saw wasn't she

21:06.580 --> 21:10.460
yeah I only saw for the first four episodes or the first two long episodes

21:10.460 --> 21:13.700
the first four hours and she had a pretty badass role I gotta say so you

21:13.700 --> 21:18.260
know her career is jump-starting anyway but she's not in the game anyway we'd

21:18.260 --> 21:22.780
love to follow up UK release dates that was it right yeah we'd love to follow I

21:22.780 --> 21:26.100
I've been cutting everybody off tonight with total randomness and I apologize

21:26.100 --> 21:29.460
but I've just been pent up for two weeks in Virginia.

21:29.460 --> 21:32.580
Loki, what's going on with U.S. release dates?

21:32.580 --> 21:33.580
Lots of stuff.

21:33.580 --> 21:35.580
Well, of course, March is a huge month for games.

21:35.580 --> 21:39.660
As I mentioned before, Burnout, Revenge, and Ghost Recon and Vance Warfighter were coming

21:39.660 --> 21:42.180
out this week for the 360.

21:42.180 --> 21:47.780
Other releases coming out this week, Championship Bowling for the Xbox, yeah, that's gonna be

21:47.780 --> 21:48.780
great.

21:48.780 --> 21:54.040

some new Pokemon puzzle games, Pokemon Trozei is coming out on the DS.

22:17.960 --> 22:22.160
I hang my head in deep shame because I want to play this game.

22:22.160 --> 22:27.920
More PSP games, Pursuit Force and Samurai Warriors are heading towards the PSP.

22:27.920 --> 22:31.500
A brand new RPG coming out, Shadow Hearts from the New World, which actually looks pretty

22:31.500 --> 22:34.780
decent on the PS2.

22:34.780 --> 22:40.880
And Spongebob Yellow Avenger on the PSP, followed by Tales of Fantasia for the Gameboy

22:40.880 --> 22:41.880
Advance.

22:41.880 --> 22:45.880
Other notable stuff coming out later on in the month here, we of course have Driver Parallel

22:45.880 --> 22:52.580
Lions coming out the week of the 13th, as well as Metal Gear Solid 3 Subsistence, which

22:52.580 --> 22:57.620
should be really sweet, at the outfit for Xbox 360.

22:57.620 --> 23:01.920
And then finally the week of the 20th, we've got a couple games coming out, most notably

finally and me and my katamari I gotta put that in there and Metroid Prime Hunters

23:21.680 --> 23:25.280

23:25.280 --> 23:28.640
and also Metal Gear Acid 2 and Mega Man Power Piv

23:28.640 --> 23:31.680
Oh my bank account is gonna cry the end of this month

23:31.680 --> 23:35.640
it's gonna be a sad week at my bank. And Worms Open Warfare and I'm actually looking

23:35.640 --> 23:36.320
forward to that game

23:36.320 --> 23:41.560
All right, just so you know, Wonder Dog Harold would also like to remind you in regards to

23:41.560 --> 23:46.200
our previous conversation, Jean Smart was also the voice of Mrs. Possible in Kim Possible,

23:46.200 --> 23:47.760
just for those of you following her career.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.560
And Beatmania on the 29th.

23:49.560 --> 23:50.600
Thank you.

23:50.600 --> 23:52.280
Which does not feature Jean Smart.

23:52.280 --> 23:53.280
No.

23:53.280 --> 23:54.280
Maybe Beatmania 2.

23:54.280 --> 23:57.320
But it's also launched the same day as Kariok Revolution Country.

23:57.320 --> 24:01.200
These games that we love, Beatmania and all that stuff, and you know we love US games

24:01.200 --> 24:05.240
too, don't get us wrong, we love games from all around, but Japan certainly brings us

24:05.240 --> 24:09.520
lots and lots and lots of memorable great games there's a magazine over

24:09.520 --> 24:13.560
there that has a lot of clout over in the Japan gaming market it's called

24:13.560 --> 24:18.480
Famitsu well they recently polled their readers to vote on their all-time

24:18.480 --> 24:23.240
favorite 100 games where there's a magazine there's another list that's

24:23.240 --> 24:28.240
right and what's interesting about this list well let me just let the list speak

24:28.240 --> 24:32.680
for itself here's the top 10 you ready number 10 Legend of Zelda Ocarina of

24:32.680 --> 24:40.600
time number 9 Dragon Quest 7 number 8 Final Fantasy 3 number 7 tactics ogre

24:40.600 --> 24:49.280
number 6 Final Fantasy 4 number 5 Machi number 4 Dragon Quest 8 number 3 Dragon

24:49.280 --> 24:54.840
Quest 3 number 2 Final Fantasy 7 and the number one game of all time Final

24:54.840 --> 25:00.720
Fantasy 10 as voted by the readers of Famitsu magazine that makes sense

25:00.720 --> 25:03.840
Because Final Fantasy X has this humongous fandom built around it.

25:03.840 --> 25:08.000
Right, and that's not surprising in any way, but let me get that straight.

25:08.000 --> 25:13.760
That's four Final Fantasies and three Dragon Quests comprising the top ten.

25:13.760 --> 25:16.800
Might I also point out Dragon Quest V, number 11.

25:16.800 --> 25:18.480
Dragon Quest IV, number 14.

25:18.480 --> 25:20.080
Dragon Quest II, number 17.

25:21.040 --> 25:22.800
Final Fantasy VIII, number 22.

25:22.800 --> 25:24.480
Final Fantasy IX, 24.

25:24.480 --> 25:26.080
Final Fantasy VI, 25.

25:26.080 --> 25:26.800
Shall I continue?

25:27.360 --> 25:28.560
So they like their RPGs.

25:28.560 --> 25:29.680
It's not surprising at all.

25:29.680 --> 25:31.180
It's not. It's really not, but it's-

25:31.180 --> 25:33.780
And I'm actually really not at all surprised to see Tactics Ogre in there.

25:33.780 --> 25:35.080
Where was Final Fantasy Tactics?

25:35.780 --> 25:36.580
Uhh...

25:36.580 --> 25:41.080
I don't see it in the top 50, maybe in the bottom 50.

25:41.080 --> 25:42.080
Let me keep looking here.

25:43.180 --> 25:46.380
Final Fantasy Tactics I know had a big following for a while, too,

25:46.380 --> 25:49.480
but Tactics Ogre completely does not surprise me.

25:49.880 --> 25:51.780
84 Final Fantasy Tactics.

25:52.080 --> 25:52.780
It's on the list.

25:53.380 --> 25:54.080
But, you know-

25:54.080 --> 25:56.280
Do they have any of the PC Engine titles in there?

25:56.280 --> 25:57.380
Like Dracula X?

25:57.380 --> 25:59.640
Yeah, I don't know if I saw anything

26:00.680 --> 26:08.360
Yeah, you know what or a dragon? What about that Animal Crossing is 43. There you go. That's something Metal Gear Solid 50

26:09.120 --> 26:12.720
Let's see. I need to know where Dracula X is on that. I don't think it's there

26:13.680 --> 26:15.240
Gradius 98

26:15.240 --> 26:20.880
I'm looking I'm looking at this is uh, they they published this over on next dash gen dot

26:20.880 --> 26:24.280
B IZ by the way is where I'm pulling this from. I don't see a single

26:24.280 --> 26:29.280
Castlevania game on here, but I'm eyeing it. I might be missing it, so I apologize if I'm wrong there.

26:29.280 --> 26:31.280
That wounds me in my soul.

26:31.280 --> 26:34.280
So, um, what do you think? I mean, I guess...

26:34.280 --> 26:38.280
They're smoking crack, but Famitsu is, like, notorious for being bastards, so...

26:38.280 --> 26:44.280
Well, you know, didn't they have to make a law that Dragon Quest games don't come out on school days or something like that?

26:44.280 --> 26:51.280
Like, it shouldn't be surprising that Dragon Quest just totally dominates this and Final Fantasy, you know, same deal.

26:51.280 --> 26:54.880
so I actually would have it I would have expected one of the Dragon Quest games

26:54.880 --> 27:00.160
take the top spot it's it's pretty big over there but now it's getting now it's

27:00.160 --> 27:03.920
finally like really catching on it hasn't really caught on since Dragon

27:03.920 --> 27:09.000
Dragon Warrior now with Dragon Quest 8 so it's kind of interesting I don't know

27:09.000 --> 27:17.080
anyway moving on let's go over to Loki for some reports on the homebrew scene

27:17.080 --> 27:25.320
of course, as always. Starting off, some wonderful games coming to the PSP homebrew scene. First

27:25.320 --> 27:33.440
one is a Halo clone. That's right, they're working on a Halo kind of port to the PSP.

27:33.440 --> 27:39.860
It's based on the game or multiplayer app Iris, and it's actually a mod, but it's going

27:39.860 --> 27:45.180
to be containing four player deathmatch type of gameplay. So that's kind of being worked

27:45.180 --> 27:46.660
on right now.

27:46.660 --> 27:50.260
As far as stuff that's out there right now, I've already mentioned this in the last podcast

27:50.260 --> 27:51.940
but gotta cover it again.

27:51.940 --> 28:00.540
The new Super Nintendo emulator SNES 9X version 0.4 has been updated with wireless multiplayer

28:00.540 --> 28:06.020
so you can actually go ahead and play people near you at some Street Fighter and they've

28:06.020 --> 28:09.940
actually clocked it at 60 frames per second while playing.

28:09.940 --> 28:11.620
So that's kinda cool.

28:11.620 --> 28:16.580
Another homebrew stuff that's going to be coming out though for the PSP, they've created

28:16.580 --> 28:22.060
an ISO loader using the exploit in Grand Theft Auto.

28:22.060 --> 28:27.620
Another thing that they've also been able to do is launch Grand Theft Auto on version

28:27.620 --> 28:29.220
1.5 firmware.

28:29.220 --> 28:32.900
And for those who have played Grand Theft Auto's Liberty City Stories, you'll know that

28:32.900 --> 28:35.180
it forces you to upgrade to 2.0.

28:35.180 --> 28:39.860
So they've actually bypassed all that and got to run on that same firmware.

28:39.860 --> 28:44.100
The other thing that they've also launched is an upgrade to that because they're worried

28:44.100 --> 28:48.020
that people are going to be pirating games and stuff, so they've actually got a UMD loader

28:48.020 --> 28:55.460
for firmware 1.5 that will run any game that will force you to update to 2.0 or higher

28:55.460 --> 28:57.900
in 1.5 if you have the UMD.

28:57.900 --> 29:00.560
Because a lot of people do have games out there they want to play but they want to play

29:00.560 --> 29:03.380
their homebrew stuff, now they can.

29:03.380 --> 29:05.640
So that's kind of cool.

29:05.640 --> 29:14.120
Other things, there was also, kind of teased a little bit for the DS, basically you can

29:14.120 --> 29:18.840
have remote access to your PC using the DS and that was kind of cool, they showed a little

29:18.840 --> 29:22.880
picture of that, but no release on that yet.

29:22.880 --> 29:30.440
Alright, keep us posted on what's going on and whatever they install Linux on next and

29:30.440 --> 29:31.440
all that fun stuff.

29:31.440 --> 29:35.440
Yeah, I was waiting for the 360 for Linux.

29:35.440 --> 29:41.440
Alright, DarkSockra, you're going to get all the fun stories tonight on like violence and political stuff.

29:41.440 --> 29:42.440
What do you got next?

29:42.440 --> 29:44.440
I'm all about the violence.

29:44.440 --> 29:47.440
I mean the poli...the...the...

29:47.440 --> 29:49.440
The politics, the violence.

29:49.440 --> 29:51.440
I'm all about the violence.

29:51.440 --> 29:52.440
Alright, we know.

29:52.440 --> 29:54.440
Okay, guess what?

29:54.440 --> 29:58.440
With the increase of video game violence,

29:58.440 --> 30:02.440
aha, we have crime going way down.

30:02.440 --> 30:06.440
Isn't that awesome? Wait, crime went down when video game

30:06.440 --> 30:10.440
violence went up? Do tell. Basically with the increase

30:10.440 --> 30:14.440
of the first person shooter genre, crime, uh,

30:14.440 --> 30:18.440
I'm sorry, I was backwards on that one. Oh, that's alright.

30:18.440 --> 30:22.440
Well, you know, we already went over that before, but the crime-based action games are

30:22.440 --> 30:26.240
declining so what that means but the still that means there's more of a

30:26.240 --> 30:29.960
demand over here than there is over there that says something yep but

30:29.960 --> 30:39.760
basically the the I'm tongue-tied excuse me but they were basically saying that

30:39.760 --> 30:47.080
even though the success of Grand Theft Auto and all that you know has been so

30:47.080 --> 30:51.520
big that they're still not so many of them coming out that the first-person

30:51.520 --> 30:58.520
shooter is really taking prevalence in the whole video game industry.

30:58.520 --> 31:01.680
But that, you know, we did have an earlier story that did state, you know, I remember

31:01.680 --> 31:05.720
doing something on the show a while ago that despite the violent video games coming out,

31:05.720 --> 31:09.520
people get their aggressions out on them or something because overall, crime rate, you

31:09.520 --> 31:10.520
know...

31:10.520 --> 31:15.760
Well, yeah, well, the thing is though is that the study is still there though at the Department

31:15.760 --> 31:16.760
of Justice.

31:16.760 --> 31:22.480
You know there are charts proving that since what was it 93 when the PlayStation came out

31:23.040 --> 31:27.080
There has been a decrease in in youth-based violence

31:28.200 --> 31:32.280
You know basically the 18 the the age 12 to 18

31:33.120 --> 31:36.620
Area that there has been a decrease in violent acts created by a minor

31:36.620 --> 31:43.640
all right all right well no but there's actually though in specifically in

31:43.640 --> 31:47.360
regards to this though first-person shooters are becoming the big deal to be

31:47.360 --> 31:50.060
continued I'm sure well we do know that of course we got a civil war

31:50.060 --> 31:55.500
first-person shooter coming out thanks what I'm from Alabama and I hear enough

31:55.500 --> 32:01.820
of this crap being from Alabama so all right moving on since we just had a

32:01.820 --> 32:05.260
story on violence I figured it was time for us to get violent with a little

32:05.260 --> 32:10.060
segment we call the FUs of the week dark soccer are you ready to get angsty

32:10.060 --> 32:13.580
when am I not

32:24.300 --> 32:34.980
my first well my big only FU is I'm tired of being the emotional receptacle

32:34.980 --> 32:45.380
the world you know I can take and take and take and take and I don't know if

32:45.380 --> 32:52.820
I'm just easily been ventable to but I have to it's not really an F you it's

32:52.820 --> 32:59.660
more of an F you toward myself just because I can't I have to get my

32:59.660 --> 33:03.820
aggression out to you damn it I don't see why everybody let it all out girl

33:03.820 --> 33:09.460
I don't see why everybody in the universe feels that they can just tell me their whole life story

33:09.940 --> 33:12.340
like it's some horrible thing and

33:13.500 --> 33:15.500
It's going to really you know

33:15.980 --> 33:22.260
Like some complete stranger starts telling me about how bad their life sucks, and I'm like okay

33:23.300 --> 33:28.980
Why are you telling me this did you tell them to stop? I just sort of said I have to go now

33:28.980 --> 33:35.540
now. But it's like, it's been happening more often than not lately that I've been getting

33:35.540 --> 33:41.500
ransomed, you know, in, in, in defensive people, you know, I never really mind hearing it.

33:41.500 --> 33:46.380
You know, if you need to vent to me, say hey, I think you're a good person to talk to, let's

33:46.380 --> 33:51.660
talk about it. But when it comes out, you know, completely unprovoked, I'm like, okay,

33:51.660 --> 33:56.500
what did that have to do with anything? This is so out of left field. And especially without,

33:56.500 --> 34:02.460
know even saying hey is this a good time for you emotionally for me to vent to

34:02.460 --> 34:06.640
you need to make sure that when you're going to talk to somebody that they're

34:06.640 --> 34:11.340
gonna be in a position to listen to you objectively and not just because you

34:11.340 --> 34:16.160
know say that the person you're talking to you is really depressed really

34:16.160 --> 34:21.720
stressed out really just having an awful day and then you start talking about how

34:21.720 --> 34:23.820
much your life sucks how's that gonna make them feel

34:23.820 --> 34:28.820
they're either gonna go excuse me your life sucks here's mine or it's gonna

34:28.820 --> 34:35.260
make them feel worse than they're gonna guess what they're at. emo

34:35.860 --> 34:41.940
so the moral of the story is get a live journal? Vlog it! you know the

34:41.940 --> 34:47.540
moral of this though is if you have a problem and you need to vent to somebody

34:47.540 --> 34:51.980
make sure that your intended venting audience is in a position that they're

34:51.980 --> 34:54.220
going to be able to withstand your vending.

34:54.220 --> 34:57.620
That's www.myspace.com.

34:57.620 --> 34:59.460
That's where the Internet goes to die.

34:59.460 --> 35:01.780
Tom will be your friend when no one else will.

35:01.780 --> 35:02.780
Just so you know.

35:02.780 --> 35:08.140
But, but I'm serious, so it's, I never mind listening to my friends when they need me.

35:08.140 --> 35:13.340
I am always there, and listeners, I am there for you, okay?

35:13.340 --> 35:18.180
But make sure that if you are going to vent to me that I am not having the utter shit

35:18.180 --> 35:20.100
of the day before you do.

35:20.100 --> 35:21.100
Thank you.

35:21.100 --> 35:29.740
Um, really the only thing I'm kind of frustrated at is Xbox Live's arcade, or not really their

35:29.740 --> 35:32.380
arcade, their online play for full auto.

35:32.380 --> 35:36.320
The people playing full auto keep jumping out of the games like they're playing Mario

35:36.320 --> 35:38.420
Kart DS or something.

35:38.420 --> 35:41.860
And granted, you know, I'm not too worried about, I mean, cause I understand people will

35:41.860 --> 35:45.940
do that, and you know, I don't think that it's a huge deal, but the fact is, you know,

35:45.940 --> 35:48.860
I'm playing the game, I'm not even doing that well, I'm getting like sixth place, and I'm

35:48.860 --> 35:54.140
still taking the spot and I'm willing to take the 6th place and not get that many points.

35:54.140 --> 36:00.140
But it doesn't even count because everyone drops out of the game. And so, I waste time

36:00.140 --> 36:04.220
playing through these races for nothing. And also, god damn it, I'm doing so good in those

36:04.220 --> 36:08.580
races and I hit a damn, like, something will fly out on the street like a little apple

36:08.580 --> 36:12.820
or something and my car will flip into the air like 50 feet because the physics are all

36:12.820 --> 36:17.340
fucked up. It's really frustrating, but god damn it at least I beat those stupid gang

36:17.340 --> 36:24.100
war missions because I wanted to break something that's it all right I you know

36:24.100 --> 36:28.540
I was actually in a really like just crappy mood all day because I like like

36:28.540 --> 36:31.860
PMS for men or something is what I've been going through today but actually

36:31.860 --> 36:36.140
the show has put me in a much better mood so I thank you guys for having a

36:36.140 --> 36:39.860
happy super duper show tonight because I'm actually in a better mood and I feel

36:39.860 --> 36:42.860
like throughout my randomness and my rants I've been able to get it out so I

36:42.860 --> 36:48.660
I guess my only FU that is left is FU to the Oscars for daring to compete with our program tonight.

36:48.660 --> 36:53.660
You're going down, Stuart. Mr. John Stuart, you're going down, buddy.

36:53.660 --> 36:55.760
Orange Lounge, aren't you?

36:55.760 --> 36:57.760
Spike, you have any angst you need to get out?

36:57.760 --> 37:01.560
I mean, with a name like Spike, you gotta be an angry person, right?

37:01.560 --> 37:06.860
Well, actually I have two things, and they're both directed towards Capcom.

37:06.860 --> 37:11.660
The first one is that as cool as I think it is that you can play as the robot masters

37:11.660 --> 37:17.180
in Mega Man powered up, these new character designs have to go.

37:17.180 --> 37:21.460
Because Mega Man is not meant to be one of those Duplo block characters.

37:21.460 --> 37:25.860
And the fact that he is, baby Jesus Christ for him.

37:25.860 --> 37:31.620
Second, Capcom is putting out a collection of their classic arcade games.

37:31.620 --> 37:35.540
It's a follow-up to their arcade classics line recently launched.

37:35.540 --> 37:37.140
the remix pack

37:37.140 --> 37:39.820
and for some reason in their infinite wisdom they

37:39.820 --> 37:43.820
seep it to take up valuable space on that UMD with

37:43.820 --> 37:48.100
Quiz and Dragons

37:48.100 --> 37:52.180
Quiz and Dragons is badass, you shut up, I love that game

37:52.180 --> 37:57.020
I used to, I used to, do you know how many quarters I wasted at the local P3 playing Quiz and Dragons

37:57.020 --> 38:01.380
and I screamed like a little girl when I found that game in MAME like years ago

38:01.380 --> 38:03.100
so sit down

38:03.100 --> 38:09.020
are you serious i am fucking serious the hell is quiz and dragon it was quiz it was

38:09.020 --> 38:15.100
a quiz show choose quiz or dragon i choose quiz can't go dad it was a quiz thing it was

38:15.100 --> 38:26.100
a quiz thing with dragon i'll have the vegetarian all right all right people all right well

38:26.100 --> 38:29.220
it just just for the record i want to stay even though spike got a little angsty there

38:29.220 --> 38:33.220
You know, Spike is actually just one of the most cuddly guys I know. He's a nice boy.

38:35.220 --> 38:35.720
So.

38:36.720 --> 38:37.720
Uh, moving on.

38:39.220 --> 38:40.220
Quiz and Dragons.

38:40.220 --> 38:44.220
He just has some strong opinions about very good games that Capcom put out that were horribly underrated.

38:44.220 --> 38:47.220
Like Black Tiger. Absolutely.

38:47.220 --> 38:49.720
I love Black Tiger, but Quiz and Dragons...

38:50.720 --> 38:53.220
Loki, speaking of, uh...

38:54.220 --> 38:55.220
Dragon-type things.

38:55.220 --> 38:57.220
Okay, actually, this game has nothing to do with dragons.

38:57.220 --> 39:00.580
I don't know what the hell that was just just just take over. Well, that wasn't

39:01.460 --> 39:04.740
You we have to stand back for a second. That was the most awesome

39:05.580 --> 39:10.060
Transition ever. Anyways, I told you I told you I'm gonna off night tonight

39:10.060 --> 39:13.760
I have like two and a half weeks to forget it. Just just go

39:14.340 --> 39:17.700
Speaking of quizzes and dragons Soul Caliber the movie

39:18.420 --> 39:22.120
Is actually being worked on right now and because you know what?

39:22.120 --> 39:26.000
apparently some movie studio out there is like you know what we have money to

39:26.000 --> 39:32.860
burn let's burn some money and yeah they anyways they launched their website for

39:32.860 --> 39:37.800
this and it teases at the movie doesn't show anything it was like a Nostradamus

39:37.800 --> 39:43.980
quote or something yeah what is this www.soulcaliburthemovie.com or

39:43.980 --> 39:51.980
soulcaliburthemovie.com and it loads up this wonderful strive to understand what

39:51.980 --> 39:53.980
But I have found through my just...

39:53.980 --> 39:55.580
Sorry, you're not Mr. Movie Phone.

39:55.580 --> 39:57.200
Just stop.

39:57.200 --> 40:01.220
Anyway, so yeah, it puts up stupid little text on there.

40:01.220 --> 40:02.980
And not a single picture of Ivy.

40:02.980 --> 40:05.460
And this sword shall smite the earth.

40:05.460 --> 40:08.940
Okay, yeah, look, I thought it was bullshit

40:08.940 --> 40:09.780
when I first looked at it.

40:09.780 --> 40:11.740
It's a fan thing, bullshit.

40:11.740 --> 40:13.920
But I was like, okay, maybe there's something going on here.

40:13.920 --> 40:17.280
So I put on my Google hat and I went over to Google

40:17.280 --> 40:18.700
and I started searching all around

40:18.700 --> 40:25.400
And sure enough, I found this page on Backstage.com and it shows films that are currently in development

40:25.400 --> 40:26.920
in the early development process.

40:26.920 --> 40:30.000
And sure enough, there it is, Soul Calibur the movie action.

40:30.000 --> 40:34.220
Look at this, Romania, China, and Canada, I guess that's where they're going to be filming

40:34.220 --> 40:35.220
this.

40:35.220 --> 40:38.080
And Second Degree Media are the folks behind this.

40:38.080 --> 40:41.120
And I could give phone numbers and stuff, but I'm not going to do that.

40:41.120 --> 40:47.820
But the executive producer behind that, Vijay P. Agarwal, you know what, I'm going to put

40:47.820 --> 40:51.120
him in the internet movie database right now you know I've always said how

40:51.120 --> 40:56.820
Canada almost resembles Romania and China well it's look it's just like you

40:56.820 --> 40:59.940
know the Oscars around tonight the big movie tonight Brokeback Mountain you

40:59.940 --> 41:04.020
know if it weren't for all the French people and snow you know we hold on but

41:04.020 --> 41:06.940
they seem Brokeback Mountain is driving all this tourism to Wyoming it was

41:06.940 --> 41:14.740
filmed in Canada which is you know amazing anyway let's see I'm still

41:14.740 --> 41:16.940
trying to find this guy's figure out what else he was affiliated with the

41:16.940 --> 41:24.700
executive producer there let's see such wonderful films as I don't know if this

41:24.700 --> 41:29.020
is the same one here that can't be the same one I know more to come more to

41:29.020 --> 41:32.420
come I'll do research and get back to you guys he hasn't made Jack for now for

41:32.420 --> 41:35.500
now let's go back to a story about Electronic Arts of course they make a

41:35.500 --> 41:39.680
lot of their money off those NFL games right the NFL and the Players

41:39.680 --> 41:43.780
Association are currently involved in a debate over salaries and players cuts

41:43.780 --> 41:48.720
et cetera, et cetera, unless they get to an agreement, they're going to maybe go on strike

41:48.720 --> 41:55.540
and maybe there'll be a lockout in 2008, who knows.

41:55.540 --> 42:00.560
If there's some antitrust that goes in here, if the antitrust rules go into play with this

42:00.560 --> 42:06.820
whole strike or whatever, it would void Electronics Arts' contract with the NFL, and that would

42:06.820 --> 42:09.760
really suck for EA if that happened.

42:09.760 --> 42:10.760
Who burned?

42:10.760 --> 42:11.760
Poor babies.

42:11.760 --> 42:13.000
So they better hope there's no strike.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
don't deserve that

42:14.000 --> 42:18.280
we'll see. I know a lot of you guys that listen to this program

42:18.280 --> 42:21.000
probably don't play those games but for those that do there you go

42:21.000 --> 42:24.720
Loki what else you got? My husband does. Anyways

42:24.720 --> 42:29.120
a couple weeks ago there was this wonderful little arcade show in Japan

42:29.120 --> 42:32.080
where they showed off some really cool stuff yes that's right

42:32.080 --> 42:36.000
AOU 2006 they had a couple

42:36.000 --> 42:39.800
wonderful highlights here we're gonna cover. First one being Time Crisis 4

42:39.800 --> 42:41.980
because you know time crisis rocks and

42:42.560 --> 42:48.800
Soul caliber 3 is finally making its way to the arcade as well some other games that taiko no tatujin

42:49.080 --> 42:53.480
Coming out now with Super Mario Brothers songs, so that should be pretty cool

42:54.440 --> 42:56.440
other things

42:56.600 --> 43:00.200
of course half-life 2 survivor, which is going to be the

43:00.760 --> 43:05.000
Arcade version of half-life 2 kind of with a lot of deathmatch stuff there

43:05.000 --> 43:13.880
Let's see here, also some stuff from Sega, Virtual Fighter 5, which looks pretty cool,

43:13.880 --> 43:19.640
and House of the Dead 4, which is really neat, better graphics of course, and they even have

43:19.640 --> 43:25.480
a version that's kind of one of those arcade ride simulator type things, with a 100 inch

43:25.480 --> 43:30.520
screen and it actually, they strap you in, it rotates around, it kind of coincides with

43:30.520 --> 43:31.520
the movie.

43:31.520 --> 43:38.260
Let's see, other things, of course, would be Virtual Strikers 4, you know, for your

43:38.260 --> 43:45.260
soccer fans, and some new brain training game, hmm, interesting.

43:48.480 --> 43:49.100
So yeah.

43:49.100 --> 43:52.740
Something of note for those of you local here to the Sacramento area, the movie theater

43:52.740 --> 43:58.500
over in Roseville currently has a test machine of House of the Dead 4. I was there last night,

43:58.500 --> 43:59.500
It was rather impressive.

43:59.500 --> 44:00.500
Oooh, House of the Dead.

44:00.500 --> 44:02.620
Does it still have the awful voice acting?

44:02.620 --> 44:03.620
Yes!

44:03.620 --> 44:04.620
Yay!

44:04.620 --> 44:08.780
And that Lindbergh board, it's putting out some textures that amazed the hell out of

44:08.780 --> 44:09.780
me.

44:09.780 --> 44:10.780
Really?

44:10.780 --> 44:14.020
Awesome, awesome 3D, and bad voice acting.

44:14.020 --> 44:18.460
I need to go spill coke on that machine.

44:18.460 --> 44:20.740
Wake me when Typing of the Dead 2 comes out.

44:20.740 --> 44:22.640
Dude, I love Typing of the Dead.

44:22.640 --> 44:26.700
I do too, that's why I'm not, I wanna do a cosplay where I strike a Dreamcast to my

44:26.700 --> 44:27.700
back.

44:27.700 --> 44:30.980
done that now done it now now makes me happy

44:30.980 --> 44:35.140
rob microsoft could be working on that next if this whole you know

44:35.140 --> 44:39.220
ddr email thing falls through maybe you know what

44:39.220 --> 44:42.340
you know what that whole typing of the dead setup reminds me of

44:42.340 --> 44:45.140
the origami

44:47.700 --> 44:50.820
tapping of the dead because you know it's got the touch screen

44:50.820 --> 44:55.460
speaking of origami sometimes we get pieces of mail and dark sakura reads

44:55.460 --> 44:58.260
them and then folds them into little paper cranes.

44:58.260 --> 45:02.860
But not some letters that she selected this week to read in our one and only mailbag.

45:02.860 --> 45:05.220
Dark Sakura, how can they send us an email?

45:05.220 --> 45:09.220
They can write to mailbag at orangesoundradio.com.

45:09.220 --> 45:13.500
And we set aside some time in the show for Dark Sakura to read these emails to you and

45:13.500 --> 45:16.340
oh look, it's time.

45:16.340 --> 45:18.860
I got a bajillion emails in the last couple of weeks.

45:18.860 --> 45:23.980
I've tried to reply to as many as I can and unfortunately I've been sort of pooped on

45:23.980 --> 45:28.780
by school so sorry as in I'm sort of skipping class tomorrow to finish my

45:28.780 --> 45:33.760
homework but hey back to the mailbag I'm such a responsible student aren't I we

45:33.760 --> 45:41.520
got an email from Robert sent us an email who had a question about guitar

45:41.520 --> 45:46.200
hero to go ahead and quote this email is there any talk about guitar hero being

45:46.200 --> 45:51.440
made for Japan sure red octane is as far as I know an American publisher unlike

45:51.440 --> 45:56.240
Like Konami who did the Karaoke Revolution series overseas as well as domestically.

45:56.240 --> 46:01.760
And the current song selections are very US and European, but do you see the game competing

46:01.760 --> 46:05.340
well with Guitar Freaks?

46:05.340 --> 46:10.600
I think most Bomani fans in general, and I'm making a broad generalization, of course there

46:10.600 --> 46:13.980
are exceptions to this, I think most of the community prefers Guitar Hero over Guitar

46:13.980 --> 46:17.480
Freaks because Guitar Hero kind of improved on the Guitar Freaks model.

46:17.480 --> 46:21.200
So could the game do well in Japan?

46:21.200 --> 46:25.480
I think they'd obviously have to change the song list, but go ahead

46:25.480 --> 46:29.320
I think Guitar Hero would have the potential to do well in Japan

46:29.320 --> 46:34.080
But the thing is you have to really focus on how the Japanese gaming market does

46:34.520 --> 46:41.880
They're going to stick more with the Bemani series. I'm sorry because there are you know, there's Namco has a guitar series out

46:42.720 --> 46:45.280
a few other companies have

46:45.280 --> 46:49.260
various other ones and still the most popular of them are still the Bimani

46:49.260 --> 46:54.580
ones even if the other ones are better. I think the most likely thing to happen if

46:54.580 --> 46:57.580
it were to happen in Japan and please please understand this is pure

46:57.580 --> 47:01.940
speculation I think harmonics would probably license that out to someone

47:01.940 --> 47:06.400
else to develop a Japanese version and I think or maybe you know like I don't

47:06.400 --> 47:09.700
think it would be that same red octane harmonics I think they would sell out

47:09.700 --> 47:13.140
the license the idea to somebody who's interested in localizing it for Japan.

47:13.140 --> 47:17.700
engine yeah I mean who knows you know that that seems the most likely to me

47:17.700 --> 47:21.540
but I don't see anything happening this year I would love to see like guitar

47:21.540 --> 47:24.480
hero visual K Edition but what's interesting is that you know guitar

47:24.480 --> 47:28.060
freaks V is still supposedly on its way we haven't heard anything in a while but

47:28.060 --> 47:32.380
supposedly it's still coming in Japan so it's an interesting you know it would be

47:32.380 --> 47:35.920
interesting if guitar hero were to come out to kind of counter this but would

47:35.920 --> 47:41.620
you know would Konami get lawsuit II over it I don't know I don't I don't know

47:41.620 --> 47:45.580
It's it's a whole nother can of worms there. Who knows? It's all speculation. So

47:46.140 --> 47:51.340
Um, we also have an email from our friend Rob with two bees. We have a lot of Rob's tonight

47:51.340 --> 47:53.400
I like that. This is a good mailbag night

47:54.140 --> 47:56.140
You'd think so, wouldn't you?

47:57.460 --> 48:04.300
Basically just to quote the email says there wasn't a true article but a link in dig comm is copied verbatim below in his email

48:04.300 --> 48:12.300
It appears to be true because searching Target.com does reveal several classic compilations of old Sierra titles for Windows XP.

48:12.300 --> 48:15.300
I talked about this last week, I might add.

48:15.300 --> 48:17.300
Okay.

48:17.300 --> 48:18.300
I'm just saying.

48:18.300 --> 48:21.300
I'm reading the email, which has nothing to do with last week.

48:21.300 --> 48:29.300
But basically the Sierra game titles are being re-released from Target.com, so just go ahead and check out Target.com.

48:29.300 --> 48:31.300
There are a whole series of them.

48:31.300 --> 48:34.860
Police Quest, Space Quest, King's Quest

48:34.860 --> 48:38.640
which will explain why they didn't get out of the game tab. Oh no, Space Quest is on

48:38.640 --> 48:39.300
game tab

48:39.300 --> 48:43.380
so I kinda was hoping King's Quest would make its way. Anyway.

48:43.380 --> 48:46.620
Also an email from

48:46.620 --> 48:50.220
Justin who I helped with the song title

48:50.220 --> 48:55.840
said he saw the Lemmings game for PSP out and released in the UK

48:55.840 --> 48:59.020
and wondering if there was a way to import it and

48:59.020 --> 49:02.740
you know if it would even play on the US PSP the answer to that is no I don't

49:02.740 --> 49:04.100
think because aren't they

49:04.100 --> 49:07.140
I don't know if they're region encoded PSP's aren't yeah they're not so

49:07.140 --> 49:08.620
actually yeah you would be able to

49:08.620 --> 49:12.700
to play it. I would just say you know

49:12.700 --> 49:16.400
check Amazon I order from Amazon UK all the time

49:16.400 --> 49:19.740
the reason why it's easier to do this with handhelds where you can cross

49:19.740 --> 49:22.900
import and all that stuff and like you know Game Boy Advance games work Japan

49:22.900 --> 49:23.620
US doesn't matter

49:23.620 --> 49:26.940
is because the handhelds have their own screens the biggest problem you run into

49:26.940 --> 49:27.500
with

49:27.500 --> 49:33.340
the UK vs the US. Anything on TV is going to be PAL vs NTSC. You got it, and until everybody's

49:33.340 --> 49:37.580
on high def we're always going to have this problem, so. However, you know, if you've

49:37.580 --> 49:43.060
got a high definition screen in the imported system you will not run into a problem. One

49:43.060 --> 49:49.100
thing of note on importing UMDs is that UMD movies are always region coded, so. Oh! This

49:49.100 --> 49:52.940
is a general rule. That's what had me thinking because I knew the movies were, I didn't know

49:52.940 --> 49:57.860
if the games were but yeah um but no you should have I suggest honestly suggest

49:57.860 --> 50:04.140
Amazon I order CDs through Amazon UK and a Japanese Amazon all the time in fact

50:04.140 --> 50:09.420
I'm gonna be paying $30 for a gorilla single in a couple of weeks freak all

50:09.420 --> 50:17.860
right hey I didn't sit on the air we did not bring you here to be a fanboy just

50:17.860 --> 50:23.680
kidding fanboy away it's fine hi me emailed us hi me not the hi me not me

50:23.680 --> 50:30.160
yes I do remember this she told us about the Darwinian was this her I guess I

50:30.160 --> 50:36.340
think I know I remember the name forget it go go ahead and go on okay um on the

50:36.340 --> 50:39.940
topic of old shows I went back to an older show and listen to you guys talk

50:39.940 --> 50:43.680
about some new portable system that was coming out soon at that time which

50:43.680 --> 50:47.800
happened to be called the gizmondo and how it had potential though it needed

50:47.800 --> 50:48.760
good games

50:48.760 --> 50:49.680
uh...

50:49.680 --> 50:52.120
you know the golden rule of the game systems

50:52.120 --> 50:55.040
you guys are pretty accurate on that show if i remember correctly on your

50:55.040 --> 50:56.440
predictions for the system

50:56.440 --> 51:00.200
i was thinking about the best of show because i still have every show since

51:00.200 --> 51:02.740
you guys have been on itunes

51:02.740 --> 51:07.440
still up to listen to some of them the for a good laugh thank you

51:07.440 --> 51:10.340
some good ones are weak of

51:10.340 --> 51:13.400
eight one oh five to eight seven oh five

51:13.400 --> 51:16.180
With that listen, I mean, I guess this is a mat quote

51:16.860 --> 51:18.600
Loki quote, sorry

51:18.600 --> 51:24.720
Listen, I'm not knocking the Mac or anything because granted the processing power may be what I'm looking for their cases look cool, though

51:25.280 --> 51:30.040
Maybe he's okay their cases are nice and then Rob

51:30.040 --> 51:35.480
Did we just go to bizarro orange challenge radio because I just heard Loki say something nice about the Macintosh. Oh

51:35.480 --> 51:45.480
Oh, and then you said the cases look nice, but that's all they are, just big graphing calculators inside of a nice case.

51:45.480 --> 51:47.480
I remember him saying that.

51:47.480 --> 51:49.480
And then breaking out the Mega Man 2 sound.

51:49.480 --> 51:54.480
Oh, that's right. Okay, yeah. You know what, there's some funny bits in the old stuff.

51:54.480 --> 52:08.800
You can dig 20 episodes back at O-L-R-P-S-P dot com, which will take you back to about

52:08.800 --> 52:13.340
like November shows, but the other old stuff, you're going to have to wait until you put

52:13.340 --> 52:14.340
out a CD.

52:14.340 --> 52:16.280
Don't we have that wiki quote page or something?

52:16.280 --> 52:17.280
There is a wiki quote page somewhere.

52:17.280 --> 52:20.040
You need to put these up on wiki quote because these are hilarious.

52:20.040 --> 52:24.040
There's one about the final thought that you did.

52:24.040 --> 52:28.280
Yeah. It was, um, we were talking about Pizza Man.

52:28.280 --> 52:32.520
Uh huh. And then, um, you said, uh,

52:32.520 --> 52:35.640
no, I said, Al, your table got GTA on my elbow.

52:35.640 --> 52:39.120
What? And then you said that, uh,

52:39.120 --> 52:44.960
she said she got beat up by Pizza Man. And I probably played, yeah, I remember that show where we were dropping that sound effect. And you played the Mega Man theme.

52:44.960 --> 52:50.080
Ah, check it out. Retro. But yeah, he's wanting more of our older, older, older shows.

52:50.080 --> 52:52.960
Which, oh my god, the older shows.

52:52.960 --> 52:56.840
Yeah, if you listen to episode one of our original live show,

52:56.840 --> 52:58.680
or like Logan is talking in a tin can.

52:58.680 --> 53:01.880
That's my horrible quote show, was the furry first show

53:01.880 --> 53:04.380
when I talked about the king of iron fingering.

53:04.380 --> 53:07.240
I don't know if that was the first, but it was the beginning.

53:07.240 --> 53:09.080
I left the show with such a migraine,

53:09.080 --> 53:11.280
because I was using that headset.

53:11.280 --> 53:13.960
But you know what, those quotes that you put up,

53:13.960 --> 53:16.700
dude, you would be our hero if you put them up on a Wiki

53:16.700 --> 53:17.200
quote.

53:17.200 --> 53:18.800
Or just put them on the forums.

53:18.800 --> 53:20.240
We have a quote thread on our forums.

53:20.240 --> 53:21.240
You should totally put them up there.

53:21.240 --> 53:21.740
There you go.

53:21.740 --> 53:23.560
It doesn't necessarily have to be the IRC.

53:23.560 --> 53:25.260
OK, start a new thread on there.

53:25.260 --> 53:26.680
Show quotes thread.

53:26.680 --> 53:28.960
There you go.

53:28.960 --> 53:29.600
OK.

53:29.600 --> 53:30.240
Any other emails?

53:30.240 --> 53:30.960
Yeah, we have a couple more, right?

53:30.960 --> 53:31.460
Two more.

53:31.460 --> 53:32.960
All right.

53:32.960 --> 53:33.640
Let's hear it.

53:33.640 --> 53:36.160
This is from Sakarina.

53:36.160 --> 53:38.760
Hi, Sakarina, one of our big old regulars.

53:38.760 --> 53:41.680
Hi, buddy, one of our Canadian listeners.

53:41.680 --> 53:46.000
According to posters on DSMeat, actually it's DSMeat.com

53:46.000 --> 53:54.600
UK game retailer chain GAME is selling a third-party headset for the DS.

53:54.600 --> 54:00.280
Apparently the headset works with mic-enabled games such as Nintendogs, and mic quality

54:00.280 --> 54:03.500
is much better than the one built in the DS.

54:03.500 --> 54:08.180
I think UK gamers might want to pick one of these up once Metroid Prime Hunters hits the

54:08.180 --> 54:13.400
streets in May for Europeans in March for North American gamers.

54:13.400 --> 54:18.760
That's the thing I always hated about Xbox Live and like people will be talking during

54:18.760 --> 54:22.640
like full auto and stuff and I can't understand anything because I can't hear the sound effects

54:22.640 --> 54:28.840
in music and if only they had better mics or weren't stupid.

54:28.840 --> 54:30.640
Not being stupid does help.

54:30.640 --> 54:34.600
We also, the last email comes from Aceman in Calgary.

54:34.600 --> 54:35.600
Hi!

54:35.600 --> 54:37.600
I like our Canadian listeners.

54:37.600 --> 54:38.600
Of course.

54:38.600 --> 54:39.600
I love Canada.

54:39.600 --> 54:41.800
I'm actually, I am probably taking a trip to Canada.

54:41.800 --> 54:42.800
You know what's funny?

54:42.800 --> 54:46.640
on celebrating I've taken a vacation this is a me trip not a work trip the

54:46.640 --> 54:49.320
last couple weeks was a work trip I'm gonna be taking a me trip I'm gonna

54:49.320 --> 54:56.980
celebrate 4th of July in Canada that's going to Canada voluntarily yes I love

54:56.980 --> 55:01.560
Vancouver I want to go to Vancouver where I'm going I've never ever left the

55:01.560 --> 55:06.400
United States and it looks like my trip to London next year is getting pushed

55:06.400 --> 55:13.060
back again due to money so I really want to go to Canada I'm we're definitely

55:13.060 --> 55:16.840
thinking about doing a fourth of July in Canada just to be ironic I think we'll

55:16.840 --> 55:22.680
be fine so we'll see um I'll let you know anyway um there's a link on a the

55:22.680 --> 55:29.800
sent to us by ace man about you a bowl deciding did not do any more video game

55:29.800 --> 55:35.760
movies and there was much rejoicing yay and and actually it's a relink to a

55:35.760 --> 55:42.060
you're a gamer article about you a bowl and basically it's a whole interview up

55:42.060 --> 55:45.860
there and I'll see if I can't find the link to post in our chat room and maybe

55:45.860 --> 55:54.700
repost on our website but basically there's a regarding the feedback that

55:54.700 --> 55:58.940
he's received from gamers to quote the dangerous thing right now is that a lot

55:58.940 --> 56:02.460
of people bash me without thinking about the movies it's fashionable to hit on

56:02.460 --> 56:08.480
Unbelievable and this is what I don't get and I don't get why this comes so harshly from the game, press

56:11.400 --> 56:12.780
There's another quote on here

56:12.780 --> 56:16.260
I won't say I won't acquire another video game license in the future

56:16.260 --> 56:19.640
But I'm not so eager to do it anymore to be honest after Far Cry

56:19.640 --> 56:24.320
Maybe I'll go away from video game based movies and everybody can be really happy about it. Yes

56:24.320 --> 56:30.020
We will are we supposed to be sympathetic because I'm not I'm not at all dude

56:30.020 --> 56:36.060
he just you know I actually clicked on the the you're a you're a gamer article

56:36.060 --> 56:38.900
I love you're a gamer if they have some of the best stuff but then another quote

56:38.900 --> 56:41.740
on here says if people don't see that then it's not my problem but I think

56:41.740 --> 56:46.020
that those people who hate me or want to bash me normal people people who buy

56:46.020 --> 56:51.100
movies or watch TV they see that absolutely you know what um why don't

56:51.100 --> 56:55.100
you just actually pay attention to what the gamers are telling you take it as

56:55.100 --> 57:00.400
feedback like any real professional would hello and actually follow that

57:00.400 --> 57:04.400
feedback and put out a quality product instead of taking your own stupid little

57:04.400 --> 57:08.640
take on it because you're just screwing it up and that's why people are bashed

57:08.640 --> 57:12.400
you know maybe if people are bashing you it's because there's a reason they're

57:12.400 --> 57:16.460
doing it and not necessarily because you know I'm sure one or two people out there

57:16.460 --> 57:20.900
are just doing it to be buttheads but you know if you're getting it from me

57:20.900 --> 57:23.980
and from the community as a whole world essentially

57:23.980 --> 57:27.180
well I'm I'm focusing on the gaming community

57:27.180 --> 57:29.940
but if you're focused but if you're getting this feedback from the gaming

57:29.940 --> 57:31.340
community as a whole

57:31.340 --> 57:34.820
why not listen you know you're taking

57:34.820 --> 57:38.500
series that we all the least chunks of us

57:38.500 --> 57:42.180
love and making a travesty of it you know

57:42.180 --> 57:46.260
why not do what they're doing with Silent Hill? They're freaking working with Konami

57:46.260 --> 57:46.740
on this

57:46.740 --> 57:50.260
here's what he has to understand here's he doesn't get it because

57:50.260 --> 57:54.120
He's getting all those people saying that the movie sucks, but he's selling millions

57:54.120 --> 57:57.460
and millions of copies on DVD or whatever.

57:57.460 --> 58:01.520
Here's my analogy to the whole thing.

58:01.520 --> 58:05.560
I'm under the assumption dog crap probably tastes like dog crap.

58:05.560 --> 58:07.200
It's probably not very good.

58:07.200 --> 58:11.840
Okay, well we know it's bad, but I'm not going to know how bad until I actually chew on a

58:11.840 --> 58:13.560
piece of dog crap.

58:13.560 --> 58:15.520
Same goes with Uwe Boll's movies.

58:15.520 --> 58:19.800
I know they're bad, but I'm not going to subject myself to them to know how bad they really

58:19.800 --> 58:25.200
are I just know they're so awful that I'm not gonna watch them worst analogy

58:25.200 --> 58:34.760
ever actually I think the dog crap one is fairly rebel relevant fine mailbag at

58:34.760 --> 58:39.680
orange lounge radio.com send us some love we love to get emails Oh baby more

58:39.680 --> 58:42.520
interaction to come a little later here in the program but first a couple more

58:42.520 --> 58:45.640
stories we are gonna open Skype line very very very soon but not until we get

58:45.640 --> 58:49.920
a story from Loki about Windows.

58:49.920 --> 58:50.920
Go Windows.

58:50.920 --> 58:53.440
Yes, Windows will be enhanced with Origami.

58:53.440 --> 58:54.440
No, I don't know.

58:54.440 --> 58:57.560
Windows Vista is going to have a gamer enhanced version.

58:57.560 --> 59:00.060
Yes, that's right.

59:00.060 --> 59:08.080
They're going to actually have basically this Windows Vista ultimate with a game performance

59:08.080 --> 59:09.840
tweaker in it.

59:09.840 --> 59:13.840
It's basically targeted towards high end PC users.

59:13.840 --> 59:19.760
And they're going to have, I don't know, it's just another excuse for you to buy a damn

59:19.760 --> 59:21.960
operating system.

59:21.960 --> 59:27.120
It's going to have DirectX 10 stuff in there of course, because it's brand new Windows.

59:27.120 --> 59:30.640
But I don't know.

59:30.640 --> 59:34.260
It's one of like seven different versions of Vista that's coming out.

59:34.260 --> 59:38.920
All of which no one will pay for and download off the internet.

59:38.920 --> 59:44.760
So yeah, alright, I got a quick story for you guys here.

59:44.760 --> 59:51.240
VIA Technologies has announced that they are establishing a training center for pro gamers.

59:51.240 --> 59:55.720
It's called the House of Chrome and it's going to be in Sweden.

59:55.720 --> 01:00:01.480
This was actually originally created for VIA's sponsored pro gaming team Girls of Destruction

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:06.320
for them to train, but they will have guests and amateur gamers as well as upcoming contest

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:07.320
winners.

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:13.620
You could go to like game summer camp and train to be a girl of destruction or something

01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:14.620
like that.

01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:15.620

01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:16.620
They have girls there.

01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:17.620
That's awesome.

01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:18.620
So that's what they do in Sweden.

01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:22.900
I can meet a real girl.

01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:26.900

Mech Assault, Project Gotham 2, Shrek 2, and the one that makes me happy is Soul Calibur

01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:25.800
2, which I already own on several systems, but still, Soul Calibur 2, which is really

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:26.800
cool.

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:29.000
That's cool, and it's like one of those things like, just buy it already if you don't have

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.960

California. Let's go to the line and pick up a call. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:31.960
Holy crap, I made it on. Hi, who's this?

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:35.280
It's Ranma. Who else would it be? Hi Ranma, how are you?

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:38.660
I'm good. This was my buddy at KatsuKan.

01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:42.240
Ranma's the reason I went to KatsuKan and put up with

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:47.080
six people at my panel. So, no, it was great though. It was a good

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:50.280
experience and I met some good... I did a lot of networking which was really good,

01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:50.880
so

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:54.680
it was a good time. Dude, you gotta come back for thirteen.

01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:58.460
Thinking about it, I already told you my Diva line.

01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:01.740
I'll only do it if my panel's at a certain time.

01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:02.980
Hey, I'll help you out with that.

01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:05.180
All right, sounds good.

01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:07.060
Hey, I just want you to know that the gifts

01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:09.740
that you sent along, I just handed out before the show.

01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:15.700
So we have our matching Mario hats as like a present,

01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:17.820
a late Christmas present, I guess, to Orange Lounge.

01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:19.620
We're just a present for no real reason.

01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:20.900
We got little Mario hats.

01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:23.100
And I have an S for Sky, a red hat.

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:30.100
And then Dark Sakura has a pink hat for Princess DS Dark Sakura, and then Loki has an L for

01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:32.900
not Luigi, but Loki, and a green hat, and it's really cool.

01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:33.900
So we love the hats.

01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:34.900
Thank you.

01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:36.940
I'm so glad you like them.

01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:38.940
What else is on your mind, buddy?

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:39.940
Not much.

01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:42.580
I just came back from playing a couple of rounds of Drunken DDR this weekend.

01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:43.580
Hot.

01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:46.780
How'd that go?

01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:50.700
The drinks weren't as strong as I thought they were, so I really couldn't get drunk

01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:52.100
per se.

01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:56.880
You know, the only time I ever really played drunk DDR was in Vegas, and I still got, like

01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:01.460
this is when DDR was still new, and you would always get a crowd every time you played,

01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:06.660
and you should have seen the crowd I got playing DDR while drunk, and I just remember, like

01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:10.500
when you would do jumps, very heavy the jumps felt.

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:11.500
Very heavy.

01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:12.500
So.

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:13.500
Alright.

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:17.500
You ever notice when you're playing DDR, you turn around after two songs, you have

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:21.980
like this entire crowd behind you, you just, and then on your next song you just fuck up

01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:25.700
and then turn around people are gone I know it's it's kinda

01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:28.380
it's like a it's like American Idol or something

01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:32.660
it's like American Idol or something you screw up one week BAM you're voted off

01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:36.180
I know it's just we're just playing DDR I mean

01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:40.220
this weekend I was the only one that could really play everybody was just giving me requests

01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:43.380
hey that's cool and I finally

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:47.420
checked out Strike it's not bad oh yeah I haven't checked it out yet

01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:51.740
DDR Strike which just came out in Japan what's your favorite new song in Strike?

01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:59.740
I must have drank it more than I suppose because I can't remember the one song I love the most on there.

01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:01.740
I've heard a lot of good things about the new Akira song.

01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:05.740
I don't think I played that one.

01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:06.740
I'm sure.

01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:07.740
It's a good song.

01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:09.740
Doll? I've heard a lot of good things about Doll.

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:12.740
Let's Dance, David Bowie, you know that's got to rock.

01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:14.740
I'm so excited about that.

01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:15.740
That's the one.

01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:16.740
There it is, alright, there you go.

01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:17.740
That loves me some David Bowie.

01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:22.740
All right, Rama, we gotta get to other callers, but anything else you want to share with our listeners?

01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:25.740
When is Loki doing more fusions?

01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:28.740
Oh, we need doing more fusion mixes, Loki. It's been a while.

01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:31.740
Don't you have anything on MySpace? You haven't plugged that in a long time.

01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:33.740
Yeah, but it doesn't have anything new on it, though.

01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:36.740
No, still, a lot of our podcast listeners probably don't even know you do these.

01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:39.740
MySpace.com slash Loki Fusion.

01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:41.740
It's all one word, Loki Fusion.

01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:43.740
Yeah, all one word.

01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:46.740
I don't know. I've been dabbling, but I haven't...

01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:53.740
The last thing I did was the not finished version of Legend of the Trance 2006 or something.

01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:57.740
That was about the last thing I did. I haven't really done anything since then.

01:05:57.740 --> 01:06:09.740
I've been fighting writer's block, trying to do something original for that Konami contest thing.

01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:13.740
But yeah, it hasn't been working out too well.

01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:16.720
It's tough, I used to be able to do it so easy,

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:20.740
back when I was working with like Techno EJ2 years ago.

01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:24.060
Such a very elementary program,

01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:26.740
but it's very easy to come up with stuff.

01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:28.320
And now it's a lot harder though,

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:29.780
when you're working with better samples

01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:30.860
and different programs and stuff,

01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:33.040
it's not as user friendly as the old ones.

01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:36.540
All right, Rama, we gotta let you go get some more calls,

01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:38.180
but thanks so much for your phone call, okay?

01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:39.340
Got it, see you laters.

01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:40.820
See ya.

01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:42.300

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:20.240
Hi, you there?

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:28.240
We're having a hard time hearing you, buddy. So sorry. Gotta let you go.

01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:32.240
Be sure to give Echo123 a call and you can always hear what you sound like there,

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:39.240
or of course, you can always try the phone number 916-226-9067, which generally has very few problems.

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:41.840
Let's try another call. Hi, you're on orange lounge radio

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:45.140
Hey, how's it going? Hi good. Who's this?

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:49.000
This is DMN. Hi DMN. What's on your mind, buddy?

01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:55.140
Well first I want to know if you guys have heard have any thoughts on a Tetris DS. I

01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:01.120
Cannot wait for Tetris DS because I have very fond memories of Tetris on the Gameboy

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:06.000
And I just I love that they're just redoing it and it's gonna be the whole like ten players

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.780
locally and all that stuff it's gonna be a good time great party game everybody

01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:14.880
got Tetris is like the anybody can play Tetris that's the nice thing about it

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:18.320
it's such an easily accessible game you know I think it's gonna make it a lot of

01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:21.600
fun and get new people you know on the DS and stuff it's gonna be a good time

01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:26.960
you can say well I tested it and I had a huge blast with it you tested it yeah I

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:33.440
kind of work over at Nintendo oh oh too bad you're under ndas or I'd be I'd be

01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:38.740
grilling you for the scoop right now it's worth the 30 bucks when it comes

01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:42.740
out I guarantee it awesome that's a great tip what about I have to ask

01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:46.060
Metroid Prime Hunters I'm kind of getting mixed mixed feelings on this one

01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:52.860
did you get well oh I played the demo I have the demo my impressions that are

01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:56.740
that first-person shooters do not work on a portables I played doom and on the

01:08:56.740 --> 01:09:02.500
GBA and it was terrible the demo was just atrocious I don't think it's gonna

01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:04.300
to do well at all.

01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:09.300
Now, I gotta ask, since you work in the inside, and maybe this is NDA, so feel free to deflect

01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:12.420
if you must, but do you know something about the revolution that the rest of the world

01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:14.140
doesn't?

01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:16.540
I know the same thing you do right now, which is nothing.

01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:18.460
We haven't seen it in the department.

01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:19.460
Interesting.

01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:20.460
Huh.

01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:22.380
Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners?

01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:24.020
What's going on over there?

01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:27.980
Well, I might as well plug my anime convention up here.

01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:29.940
I'm the gaming manager of Sakura Con.

01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:31.820
It's in downtown Seattle.

01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:33.020
It's going to be a lot of fun.

01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:35.220
It's going to be March 24th of the 26th.

01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:36.220
Son of a gun.

01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:40.540
Somebody's trying to get me to come up to Sakura Con.

01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:42.780
It's one of those things where it's like if I can get the time off work, I would go, but

01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:43.780
I don't know.

01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:46.620
It's over a weekend, right?

01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:49.620
Different weekend as what?

01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:53.940
Well, I mean, it's Friday through Sunday, right?

01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:55.980
Yeah, it's Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:58.620
You'd be totally stupid to have a con during the week, so I hope so.

01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:02.620
Hey, tell that to the people who do anime expo, okay?

01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:06.620
I don't know, I'd be down for at least a day of that.

01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:10.620
How can I pass up Sakurakan?

01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:14.620
We'll think of a way to get there. I don't know. It's gonna take some clever plotting.

01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:18.620
Seattle's not that far of a flight from here. I'll have to open up the cosplay box

01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:22.620
and break out the bike in costume. We'll see what we can do.

01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:26.620
We're also venturing a new part of DDR. We're combining a DDR and a game show, so we're gonna

01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:30.700
see how that works out awesome I want to see this hey if we come up can we get

01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:34.820
like a panel or something or is it too late don't I think it's a little late

01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:40.220
but um I could probably see if I could swing you guys in as a you know industry

01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:43.900
guests or something that would rock let's talk offline send us an email okay

01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:47.540
all right no problem Jamie all right we'll see what we can do all right take

01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:53.540
care all right take care bye bye bye I think the vendor I met was gonna go to

01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:56.340
that same convention it was also trying to get me to go up a lot of people were

01:10:56.340 --> 01:10:59.220
telling me about that convention that's pretty cool that was that was a very

01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:03.980
random call dude worked at Nintendo big big big big wig in this convention that

01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:07.420
were who would have thought someone who knew people listen to this program

01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:11.900
thought someone in the Washington working at Nintendo also later in the

01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:17.460
year my husband and I were planning a trip to go to Prosser and Kennewick

01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:23.100
because well his family lives in Prosser hmm and so we've been up to Washington

01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:28.700
state before and we've been sort of thinking about looking for housing right

01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:31.980
around though like in Washington if we want to go we got a book a flight like

01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:36.660
this week you know my husband once once me and him to move to Washington which

01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:40.620
I've said no I wonder I'm gonna talk to my friend in Seattle see what we can

01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:45.460
cook up all right so I will see well see no promises let's do one more call I'm

01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:47.460
I'm gonna go over here.

01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:49.100
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:51.720
Hello.

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:52.980
Hi, who's this?

01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:54.540
Intended Maniac 64.

01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:55.820
Hi, what's on your mind?

01:11:57.340 --> 01:11:58.460
I'm real angry.

01:11:58.460 --> 01:12:00.940
Keep Orange Lounge Radio to work in Winamp.

01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:02.340
Orange Lounge Radio doesn't work in Winamp?

01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:03.520
What's going on?

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:04.420
I don't know.

01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:08.220
Keeps asking me to log in with my Live 365 account.

01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:11.140
Live 365 gives us issues sometimes.

01:12:11.140 --> 01:12:17.380
Are you letting the computer retain cookies?

01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:22.660
You know what, do us a favor, send live365 an email.

01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:26.380
I wish there was more we could do on that end, but there's really unfortunately not

01:12:26.380 --> 01:12:27.380
a lot.

01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:31.660
Believe me though, we are aware and every time things like this happen, it makes us

01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:34.340
not want to be there anymore.

01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:36.580
But you know, we're kind of stuck for right now.

01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:40.860
Well I'm living with real player right now, I know, many people don't like it.

01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:46.460
works. I use iTunes sometimes, but the thing is that Winamp is the only way you can get MP3 Pro.

01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:51.580
Little known fact, the podcast is actually encoded in MP3 Pro, so if you listen to the podcast in

01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:56.380
Winamp with the codec, it actually sounds a lot cleaner, so just a little thought there. Okay,

01:12:56.380 --> 01:13:00.300
cool. All right, well Nintendo Maniac, thanks for the call. Anything else you want to share?

01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:05.740
Unlike the last guy, I'm actually excited about Metroid Prime Hunters.

01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:14.340
any particular reason why well online multiplayer maybe I guess yeah yeah

01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:17.860
that's another online player I'm just curious if that's gonna be as cool as it

01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:23.180
sounds I'm looking forward to it though okay all right take care buddy thanks

01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:28.100
for calling see ya later all right thank you guys so much for calling in we

01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:33.540
appreciate it there that's our skype line let's get back into the news for

01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:37.340
one last story here tonight

01:13:37.340 --> 01:13:40.180
actually first before I get to the last story I'll go around see if there's any last

01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:41.160
minute entries here

01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:44.300
Loki because I think I saw you bring up something on the origami is that like a

01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:44.900
last minute

01:13:44.900 --> 01:13:48.800
edition here? It was just a picture of it and it's a little bit smaller than the

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:51.540
concept video that they show because that video is pretty old

01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:54.700
but still I think I could

01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:58.460
take somebody out with this thing. We've been given this thing a hard time

01:13:58.460 --> 01:13:58.840
tonight

01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:02.700
honestly if I have the money to throw away on something like if I was a

01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:06.140
a business person that made a lot of money, maybe I would check this out.

01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:10.660
But until we hear about some gaming stuff, it's still going to be the butt of our jokes.

01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:11.660
Sorry.

01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:12.660
Yeah.

01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:13.660
Anyways.

01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:17.380
Well, first thing I got to mention, because this is like a major story, we're just kind

01:14:17.380 --> 01:14:18.700
of glancing over.

01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:19.700
Oh, sorry.

01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:21.620
DS Lite actually launched in Japan.

01:14:21.620 --> 01:14:22.620
Oh, yeah.

01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:23.620
I thought you covered...

01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:24.620
And it's so pretty.

01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:26.260
I thought you covered this on one of the mini-shows for some reason.

01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:29.000
Well, I may have mentioned it, but yeah, DS Lite launched.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.420
It's pretty, it's bright.

01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:35.140
That's everything we had hoped for, so yeah, that's kind of cool.

01:14:35.140 --> 01:14:40.580
And then, what else was I going to mention here, of course, if you like, what was I going

01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:49.900
to say, Geometry Wars, there's a nice little knockoff here you can download at www.incitti.com

01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:56.040
slash blitz, and they've got a nice little game you can play here that's a clone of Geometry

01:14:56.040 --> 01:15:00.300
Wars 3, and also another game called Marble Insanity, which is just like Marble Madness.

01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:04.160
And unfortunately, that's not available for download yet, but it looks really sweet with

01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:05.160
what they're doing.

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:09.020
And finally, of course, Rockstar announced a new game that they're making this week,

01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:10.980
and it's Table Tennis!

01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:11.980
Yes!

01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:12.980
Table Tennis for the 360!

01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:13.980
Oh yeah!

01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:18.360
Nothing that I would rather have more than Grand Theft Auto is...

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:19.360
Table Tennis!

01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:23.980
Unfortunately, you can't take people's heads off of the, you know, the ping pong ball,

01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:24.980
but um...

01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:25.980
Yeah.

01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:26.980
I get it.

01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:31.260
There's a code that you put in and the chick will start doing tricks with ping pong balls,

01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:32.260
right?

01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:37.540
And as I mentioned before, Trauma Center is coming out for the revolution, so it's according

01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:39.580
to the IGN podcast.

01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:44.180
If you didn't get that joke, by the way, ask your mommy and daddy.

01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:45.180
Don't tell them you heard it here.

01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:48.940
Ubisoft announced that they're going to be releasing a new Rainbow Six game for next

01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:55.060
Gen consoles, Rainbow Six Vegas. And this has actually come from the brand new issue

01:15:55.060 --> 01:16:02.060
of EGM. So, looks pretty sweet so far. And also, Bungie says that I Love Bees 2 is fake.

01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:12.620
So... I hate viral marketing because viral marketing is not viral anymore. It's just

01:16:12.620 --> 01:16:18.260
because viral marketing is not viral anymore it's just no one cares it's

01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:23.700
trendy it's stupid it's like before you know people didn't know what they were

01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:27.820
advertising it was just something that's like wow is this you know and you try to

01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:32.540
figure out more information like the whole thing with about the Xbox 360 that

01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:35.940
was kind of cool because you know they they were leaking information through

01:16:35.940 --> 01:16:41.380
there and stuff but you know having a counter on Ubisoft's you know site you

01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:46.600
splinter cell site you know saying it happens to be counting back 360 hours

01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:50.400
hmm I wonder if that could be an announcement for the splinter cell for

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:58.120
the 360 or you know whatever it's just retarded just my rant there all right

01:16:58.120 --> 01:17:02.500
dark soccer you have any last stories for us just out of curiosity anything

01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:06.680
you've been holding out on just wanted to check I will continue to keep my

01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:10.240
secrets all right well here I have something that might interest you this

01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:12.800
seems like something you'd get a kick out of because it's Sega related and we

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:16.720
know you're a Sega fangirl here it is and this is a story that ran on joystick

01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:21.320
earlier this week did you know that there was a pen and teller Sega CD game

01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:26.240
it was I didn't know that it was pen and teller smoke and mirrors is what it was

01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:29.280
called it was never released actually which is why you've probably never heard

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:33.600
of it but get this there actually is a torrent out there now floating on the

01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:38.560
internet so you can download it burn it and just load it up in the Sega CD

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:41.960
there's actually a part in this game that the article talks about called the

01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:45.880
desert bus minigame you drive a bus in the desert your goal is to go from

01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:50.740
Tucson Arizona to Las Vegas your bus never goes more than 45 miles an hour so

01:17:50.740 --> 01:17:54.720
the trip takes approximately eight hours in real time to make there's no scenery

01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:58.960
or even other cars on the road just plain desert for eight hours oh and your

01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:01.980
bus veers to the right just slightly so it's impossible to just take down a

01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:05.780
button and go do something else rumor has it that if you make it to Vegas you

01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:12.780
score one point sounds awesome can't wait to play it I never released imagine

01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:19.180
that I have one more story but it's quite funny okay I wanted the last story

01:18:19.180 --> 01:18:24.820
hmm French developer cyanide has launched their online home of their

01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:33.060
forthcoming action RPG Loki you ass there's not a whole lot of content on

01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:39.180
the site at the moment just a forum and some screenshots but my guess is gonna

01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:45.220
be it's based around my life shut up as exciting as it is trolls and all no but

01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:50.580
um I just had to point out because you know it's funny all right on that

01:18:50.580 --> 01:18:55.340
egotistical note it's time to end the show our special guest spike our buddy

01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:59.220
spike thank you so much for being here tonight thank you for having me and and

01:18:59.220 --> 01:19:02.700
laughing at our jokes which makes us feel good and and praising the almighty

01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:07.820
dark sakura i noticed at certain points there during the show make my ego grow

01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:11.820
it's just awesome just add water okay actually i'm really excited now to go

01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:15.580
download this pen and teller game i know let me know how the bus driving goes uh

01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:18.860
any final thoughts for our listeners

01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:24.700
quiz and dragons look buddy that's a challenge you're issuing a

01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:28.220
challenge here all right uh loki your final thought

01:19:28.220 --> 01:19:30.020
uh...

01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:33.480
yeah i'm gonna i can't wait to play some new games this week

01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:35.060
burnout and uh...

01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:39.020
like i guess burnout is not exactly a new game but

01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:39.860
i don't know

01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:42.440
i looked forward to playing burnout again

01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:46.140
uh... my final thought is the oscars are a sham

01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:50.100
why don't you just go watch a movie that looks interesting and not that somebody

01:19:50.100 --> 01:19:52.360
told you to watch or told you that was good

01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:54.360
make up your own mind

01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:57.920
They pay millions of dollars for those ads in variety.

01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:01.280
It's a sham. Go outside.

01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:06.440
Support independent films too. You can watch a big blockbuster once in a while, but don't forget to go to your

01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:09.780
local art house cinema because you might be missing something good. Dark Soccer, your final thought.

01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:14.780
