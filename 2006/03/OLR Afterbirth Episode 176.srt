00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,240
Hi, we're back here for the Orange Launch Radio Afterbirth, the part of the show that's

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:17,280
too hot to podcast, because Bugd is going to show us his boobies right now.

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,280
Whew!

4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,080
Hooray for boobies.

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,080
That's next week.

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,240
Alright, so here we are, just kind of chilling, sitting back here, kind of decompressing a

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,440
little bit from tonight's show.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,600
You know, the first half of tonight's show is an hour and a half?

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:31,900
Craziness.

10
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:32,400
Crazy.

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,100
That's, I think, our longest segment we've ever done.

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:35,600
Wait, you have three ha-

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,440
We just can't shut up, like, ever.

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,660
You have three halves of a show.

15
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,820
Yeah, seriously.

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,100
Um...

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,040
Oh, I like this, you like this.

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,120
Right at the end of the show, here comes, uh, Bobby Blackwolf from AllGames.com into the chat room.

19
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,080
He just came in there and he said, uh, let's see, da-da-da-da-da.

20
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,160
Uh...

21
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,780
I said, what's up?

22
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,200
And he says, you're cancelled.

23
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:55,980
I'm like, what?

24
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,480
He said, oh no, just messing with you guys.

25
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,880
What a jerk! You jerk!

26
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,000
My whole problem with Captain N, like I said...

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,320
Wait, wait, this is random. Where's this coming from? This is because of the Captain N thing.

28
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,600
He was actually replying to me. Gotcha.

29
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,880
My whole problem with the Captain N thing is because I loved following the

30
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,560
stories

31
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,480
ever since I was little and to see characters that I had loved in the games

32
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,000
being just trashed so horribly

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,280
for the sake of marketing just completely pissed me off.

34
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,680
Even though I did watch the show religiously cuz like the Zelda episodes were redeeming

35
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,680
I thought the Tetris thing was pretty freaking funny

36
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:40,080
But and that and I love mother brain and the eggplant wizard Dennis Hopper as Koopa. Yeah, there was that yeah

37
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,680
There was that

38
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,480
but

39
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:50,240
There were just so many things I could not get over in that even as a little kid that to this day. I have this

40
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,200
long-standing, I wouldn't say a hatred but a frustration with the whole Captain

41
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:05,680
N franchise. You know what's funny? The fact that I never watched Captain N. No, not Captain N. I was reading

42
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,840
there was another news story that came out this week regarding G4 and how

43
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,540
they're doing Star Trek 2.0 on their station basically putting on the old

44
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,040
episodes of Star Trek and having a bunch of different counters and stuff like

45
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,560
how many times you know spot Star Trek exactly it's like how many times you

46
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:32,000
know Spock says you know logical or illogical and like crap like that have

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,520
they stopped playing video game programming on that station because or

48
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,960
new video game programming maybe other than attack the show because they have

49
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,200
like a lot of filler and I don't understand why they got rid of these old

50
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,200
shows

51
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,560
i kinda don't care i'd i just don't care anymore

52
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,640

53
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,560

54
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,000
internet is for porn

55

we have the resources so with is not cheap

94
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,020
we we were hoping somebody bigwood put an offer to buy us out for a million

95
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,140

00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,040
hi you're on orange launch radio

110
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,840
hey what's up boss obviously you already know who i am

111
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,800
hello zacku

112
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,040
yeah what's up boss not much we want to finish up tonight's show so you got to keep it short

113
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:04,320
what's on your mind basically i'm just you know i yesterday i went to an anime convention i was

114
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:10,640
lucky to play you know 2dx and popping on the respective ascs um i don't know is if it's normal

115
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:16,720
but it's i mean the transition between both of them it's kind of strange and i know for a fact

116
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,960
and when i was playing 2dx it was just like my scores decreased as a result because i'm used to

117
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,400
to the KLC I don't know if there's anything you can help me you know any

118
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,880
advice you give me if I try what was the controller they were using I'm you

119
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,680
currently I'm using a KLC and what were they using then this do bought in an

120
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,760
ASC yesterday for 2dx and poppin oh you know what it's it's the turntable

121
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,120
differences is gonna write you up yeah um you know there's really not a lot

122
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,800
it's just one of those practice but it's you're not gonna get enough time to get

123
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,720
adjusted at a convention you're not gonna have the time to get adjusted to

124
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:57,320
Well actually I was there for hours, I mean I was on the 2DX setup for like several hours.

125
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:02,200
So you know, at least three to four hours because it was very small, no one was really

126
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,040
there in the 2DX setup.

127
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,080
I honestly don't know what to tell you bud, it's just kind of one of those things you

128
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,600
just have to get used to, there's really no way I can tell you to, my thing is that maybe

129
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,460
you get used to one playing style on the home controller, but here's the thing, the big

130
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:20,360
trick to being able to scratch in 2DX is that, and this takes a while to get the hang of,

131
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,360
the pinky scratching. You have to be able to move that turntable with your pinky, and

132
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,360
I know it sounds a little crazy.

133
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,360
Yeah, I tend to do that as well.

134
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,360
Well, you really gotta master that.

135
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,360
Digital life this year in New York City. You know, the annual thing. I know you tried valiantly

136
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,360
to try to make plans last year.

137
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,360
When is digital life this year?

138
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,360
It should be in October. You know, they already announced, you know, they already pre-announced

139
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,360
it, you know, the event.

140
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,360
Yeah, I'll try to come.

141
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,300
So, you know, you know as soon as they left the convention center as a sign that said see you next year

142
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:56,960
Yeah, I said the dates in mid-october. I'm not sure you know, I haven't got confirmation about the you know

143
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,900
The the big GDR Nationals tournament being held up, but most likely they will hold it up assuming

144
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:08,720
You know now that supernovas, you know getting you know more getting likely to get you know, they're being really good

145
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,780
So, I don't know if you're gonna make plans for it

146
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:16,120
I just want to know if you know if if you are gonna make plans or something like that

147
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:22,500
What for digital life yeah, if you're planning to go out there do something live or something

148
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:29,100
Like what it's like about it's a budget thing for us

149
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:33,520
I mean if we had the money to do it we would but we're still you know we don't make money off of doing this

150
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,460
We do this show because I love it, and I think people sometimes forget that sometimes right

151
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:42,140
especially some of the reviews I read on the internet people obviously don't get

152
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,560
that we do this for free but whatever you know we look past that because you

153
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:51,760
know we're not gonna let people's bad-mouthing get us down but you know if

154
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,740
we have the money I'm sure we'll try but it'll be an individual thing I mean

155
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,680
we'll have to decide as individuals if we can accommodate into our schedule I

156
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,640
would love to try and come I have a good friend in New York City that would let

157
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:08,880
stay there. So maybe. I would say probably I would do it. And I would say probably I'm

158
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,000
more likely to do it than Dark Sakura or Loki. I don't know. Are you guys thinking about

159
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:20,240
this or? I don't have the available time off. Especially since there are other things that's

160
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,440
true to be discussed. Oh, that reminds me. I do have to I do have to bring up the Seattle

161
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,800
convention that we were talking about last week. I'm not going to be able to make it.

162
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,520
just too soon for us, I'm sorry to say.

163
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,120
I do have a friend going to Sakura Con.

164
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,800
Uh, just putting it out there, you know.

165
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,140
No, no, obviously, yeah, we'll definitely consider it, you know, but just, it's a money

166
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,140
thing for us.

167
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:43,080
Um, Anime Expo, not gonna happen for me, um, I totally forgot that I have plans to go to

168
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,280
Canada to celebrate the 4th of July.

169
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,280
Making arrangements-

170
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,280
Just to be funny.

171
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,400
Actually, just to, I can't say which one yet, I am making arrangements for another convention.

172
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,400
Sweet!

173
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,400
Alright.

174
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,400
Alright.

175
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,600
Alright, well, Zaku, thanks for the call, and take care, okay?

176
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,120
Alright. Later, man.

177
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,240
Sorry to the calls we didn't get to, but we gotta wrap up tonight's show,

178
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,760
because we want to, you know, go back to our regular lives.

179
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,560
So, we're gonna get into tonight's cage match.

180
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,240
Wait, wait. You guys have lives outside of this?

181
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,160
Believe it or not, once in a while.

182
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,080
That's my problem. I keep forgetting that part.

183
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,800
Alright. Let's see here. I gotta find the theme music here.

184
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,800
My directories are all screwed up now.

185
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,360
Loki, remind our listeners how the cage match works while I set this up.

186
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,600
The cage match works. Basically we have three songs that are put in by each one of the hosts.

187
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,600
Then we play each song in its entirety except for the one that won.

188
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:43,400
And the winning song of the cage match is put in the rotation and will come up, you know,

189
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:48,760
to be challenged by two more songs next week. And the actual listeners in our chat room get

190
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,040
the vote on them to see which one goes on. Sweet!

191
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,040
Alright, uh, let's see, I'm trying to find the song here from last week.

192
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,040
I was exhausted tonight, I'm sorry guys.

193
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:07,040
I apologize to our live listeners, they've had to put up with a lot of crap tonight, so I apologize.

194
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,040
Lame it all on caffeine!

195
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,040
Because we sure are.

196
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,040
Alright, let's see, where's my new stuff here?

197
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,920
to do

198
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,960
uh... there is a rate there's last week's winner okay now we can do this

199
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:27,000
all right here the theme music please

200
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,800
last week in the orange launch radio cage match we had the is so it was a

201
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,360
family might know from the ultra mixed three they had a song that i've been

202
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,420

203
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:44,100
kinetic mix and uh... that's what one last week's case match so here it is a

204
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,980

207
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,980
Oh, oh, these chains

Wait, I am going under, under Please stop, help me catch my breath

209
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:54,500
Oh, these chains, they have tied me up in the right

210
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:59,300
Just that, with another set

211
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:07,140
And I'm really trying to reveal

212
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,660
My composure and my pride

213
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:20,140
You said it's just the escaping wounds

214
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:26,140
And we call the anguish in sight

215
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:30,140
Anguish in sight

216
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,140
Anguish in sight

217
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:36,140
Anguish in sight

218
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:39,140
Anguish in sight

219
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,140
They say

220
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:46,140
Can't I be your window light?

221
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:59,140
Alright, that was song number one in tonight's CAGEMATCH, the Azoic with Going Under, the

222
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,140
Kinetic Mix.

223
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,220
We'll see if it can win two weeks in a row, but it's gotta beat these songs.

224
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,620
Loki, what's song number two tonight?

225
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:08,940
Ah, this song is one of my favorite songs from Burnout Revenge.

226
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,040
It's actually by Junky XL, and it's a song called Today, and it kinda reminds me a little

227
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,060
bit of Depeche Mode and Away, but it's an awesome song.

228
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:25,180
favorite bar none of all the tracks are on the burnout series so that would be

229
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:29,740
pretty awesome I actually look for the album because the album this is the

230
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:34,240
title from the album so all right sounds good here's song number two tonight

231
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,640
junkie XL with today from burnout

232
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:59,240
Got the bluest eyes that I have seen Lost out in the skies caught in a dream

233
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,240
What you whispered to me

234
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,240
And breathing to my veins

235
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,240
I believe in magic

236
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:15,240
To wash away this pain

237
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:22,240
And it feels like today

238
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:29,240
Took your soul down tight and let it slip away

239
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:36,240
And it feels like today

240
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:43,240
Took your sword untied and let it slip away

241
00:16:43,240 --> 00:17:07,240
Give me all the weight that holds you down

242
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:15,240
Don't let it stop, I'm burning for the sand

243
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:21,240
And the world keeps moving

244
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,240
It's all I've ever known

245
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,240
And I know inside that

246
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,240
I'll never be alone

247
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:42,240
And it feels like today

248
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:49,240
So just hold on tight and let it slip away

249
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:57,240
And it feels like today

250
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:03,740
So just hold on tight and let it slip away

251
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,240
Oh

252
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:24,600
And it feels like today So just hold on tight and let it slip away

253
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:31,720
And it feels like today

254
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:39,080
So just hold on tight and let it slip away

255
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:46,280
And it feels like today

256
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:53,640
So just hold on tight and let it slip away

257
00:19:53,640 --> 00:20:00,640
And it feels like today

258
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:07,440
So just hold on tight and let it slip away

259
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,640
Oh

260
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:22,240
song number two that was junkie XL with today let's see what the studio folks

261
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,920
thought of that but remember it is up to you guys you have to be in our chat room

262
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:31,480
to vote. Dark Sakura. That one was pretty neato. Um, it gets, uh, an eight. Loki. Ten.

263
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:37,440
I love it. I play all my races to that song. Bud. Ten, because, uh, I also play many of

264
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,900
my burnout races to that song. Uh, this is very rare for me to do, but the only thing

265
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,480
wrong with that song is that it's a little bit long, but it's perfect for this station.

266
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,760
Ten. Alright, let's go to, uh, song number three tonight. Dark Sakura, what'd you pick?

267
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:57,340
I have Roz to blame for this one. It's a Tally Hall song. It's called Twooove.

268
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,340
Twooove?

269
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,340
Twooove.

270
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,140
Is that like the Princess Bride?

271
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,140
Marriage.

272
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,140
Twoo!

273
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,140
Marriage!

274
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,140
Twooove!

275
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,140
Marriage!

276
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,140
Twooove!

277
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,140
Tuck. Scum.

278
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:13,540
Alright, here we go. We're gonna go to Tally Hall with Twooove. Here it is, song number

279
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,540
three tonight.

280
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:32,540
I have this little thing, it's probably just a fling

281
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:39,540
Two girls I like a lot, I think they're really hot

282
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:46,540
But I'm not sure if they know How my love began to grow

283
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:55,540
It took a lot of time But right now it's solely mine

284
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,540
To the day!

285
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:04,540
I drew a mural of The things I'd like to love

286
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:07,540
And where my heart resides

287
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:11,540
Is with two girls with grey eyes

288
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,540
If it just gave me a chance

289
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,540
I'd show them what they want and teach them what they got

290
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:19,540
I'd single each and every one of their fancies

291
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:22,540
I'd take the key to my heart and open it

292
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,540
And let their love shine through

293
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,540
Mary came and I see, I hope you understand

294
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:30,540
That I love you a lot and I want to be your man

295
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:38,040
And I think, that it'd be totally cool if I grabbed your apartment and enrolled in a school

296
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,540
MARY KATE!

297
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:46,540
I saw you on TV, you dressed up like a bee

298
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:53,540
Reminds me of the time, how it's gone, and it's gone, and it's gone

299
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:58,540
The sun is every day that passes without you

300
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:03,540
And I really wanna, really wanna, really wanna hold you both tight

301
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:06,540
And tight for your mind because I see

302
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,540
Mary came and asked me, I hope you understand

303
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,540
That I love you a lot and I wanna be your man

304
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:16,540
And I think that it'd be totally cool

305
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:20,540
If I'm around your apartment, sending gold in your school

306
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,540
Hello?

307
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,540
Hello?

308
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,540

00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,540
I think I just won't leave you alone

311
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,540
Hello?

312
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,540
Hello?

313
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,540
Hey, I'm calling from Talley Hall and I just-

314
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,540
Mary-Kate and Ashley, I hope you understand

315
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:42,540
That I love you a lot and I wanna be your man and I think

316
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:48,540
That it'd be totally cool if I came around your apartment and enrolled in your school

317
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:59,540
I know that life without you and you would be sad

318
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,540
And I know it'd be bad

319
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:09,540
Merrick and Ashley, I hope you understand that your loveliness blossomed and I want to hold your hands

320
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:16,960
and I think that it'd be totally cool if I hung around your apartment and has gone into school

321
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:23,800
Mary Kate and Ashley I hope you understand that I love you a lot, and I wanna be a man

322
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:30,980
And I think that it'd be totally cool if I hung around your apartment and has gone into school

323
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:37,580
Mary Kate and Ashley I hope you understand that I love you a lot, and I wanna be a man

324
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:41,040
And I'm thinking, wouldn't you say that it'd be totally cool

325
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:45,040
If I were a round-jawing, fronting, sending, going to school

326
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,460
Larry Keaton, actually, I hope you understand that

327
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:51,960
I love you a lot, and I want you to be with me

328
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,460
Song number three tonight, Tally Hall with Twi'wuv

329
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,200
Did you wuv that song, or did you hate it?

330
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:01,860
Dark Sakura

331
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,520
It gets a ten for being ridiculous

332
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:04,800
Loki

333
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,800
It is ridiculous. Everyone knows it's pre-Anorexic Lindsay Lohan that's worth loving.

334
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,800
Can you score?

335
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,800
Huh? Oh.

336
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,800
Can you score?

337
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,800
Seven.

338
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,800
All right.

339
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,800
I'll give it eight. It had a good beat and you can dance to it.

340
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,800
All right.

341
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,800
And I will give it the combined weight of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, which is eight.

342
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,800
Eight pounds. That's how much they weigh.

343
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,800
All right. It's definitely a genre night.

344
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,920
We've got real actually I think it's a like all the songs are actually really good tonight

Sorry, we got dead air there for a minute. I'm very sorry there

353
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,600
Let's recap there. Hopefully some folks are still connected. They're just a little soundboard problem on my end. Sorry guys

354
00:27:53,280 --> 00:28:00,920
Let's go back place vote now. And here we go. How was your week? How was your day? Loki starting us off tonight. Anyways, I

355
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,760
We're starting to finalize more stuff for the wedding. We

356
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:10,900
Set aside some time to or we're going to go pick up our marriage license

357
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:15,860
and we're also we just sent out the rest of the invitations we have someone now

358
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:21,060
making favors and just kind of some of that stuff and I've been playing video

359
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:27,700
games most of the week and just work stuff you know trying to you know finish

360
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:35,020
March and get April started you know fun stuff and then we did a marathon session

361
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:39,580
of grant that thought of Liberty City stories after work last week we got to

362
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:44,280
play one of the brand new or one of the modes that they have on there. It's tanks

363
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:48,280
for memories and that's actually pretty fun. You start off and you pick up the

364
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,640
tank and then once you're in the tank everybody else is trying to blow up the

365
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,680
tank. You're trying to stay in the tank for a set amount of time and so your

366
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,760
timer is counting down while you're in the tank. If your tank explodes the

367
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,780
person that destroyed the tank gets the tank now and they respawn in another

368
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:13,060
spot so it's pretty fun the tape doesn't move hardly at all and it's pretty cool

369
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:17,980
it's definitely a change from the normal deathmatch games we play so that's

370
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:21,860
pretty cool I'm hoping that they the next Grand Theft Auto that comes out

371
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:27,500
does support more players because six players is fun but I mean I would like

372
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:33,540
maybe ten or twelve at the most I think would be really good get some good team

373
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:40,100
matches going on there other than that really not too much else just I had

374
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:46,420
garlic on Friday and I still smell like garlic today after like numerous showers

375
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:51,060
and brushing my teeth I that smell does not go away you smell like garlic I

376
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:55,840
smell like a mocha I'm still tasting curry from Thursday night I only have

377
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,200
one for full

378
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,320
uh... that it

379
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,840
that's it uh...

380
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,840
dark sakura

381
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:06,200
going around she is used as you know that in their apartments trapping cats

382
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,720
now fun

383
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,400
but how should we go today

384
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,800
my week with my week was rather uneventful the let's see how to

385
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,420
whirlwind tour through

386
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:17,200
through the barrier to drop stuff off and pick stuff up

387
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,120
for the roommate and i

388
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,380
as we are

389
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:24,900
both rather unemployed and still needing to pay bills or selling off stuff is if

390
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:29,580
If anybody needs computers, I got some.

391
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,940
I'm out of hard drives.

392
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,940
I already sold all those off.

393
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,940
But.

394
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,940
No.

395
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:45,380
In fact, my roommate is waiting on a replacement screen for his ThinkPad, so.

396
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:53,620
Whirlwind Tour, playing video games, raiding trash heaps, finding Macs of all things, and

397
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:58,460
reconstituting him into machines to be sold.

398
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:01,340
Yes, exciting. Oh, and playing Diablo II.

399
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,260
Fun times.

400
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:08,020
My week and my day was pretty good. I went to Roseville Golf Land on

401
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:12,060
Friday... no, Saturday. Last night. Yeah, last night. I'm drunk.

402
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:15,060
No, I'm not. For the first time in forever.

403
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,400
It was

404
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,880
interesting.

405
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:22,060
I actually had a lot of fun playing, like, Initial D and stuff and

406
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:25,020
uh... just kinda you know being there with uh... couple people

407
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,060
but uh...

408
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:30,060
ddr was still can ask the but i a you know i find that i i like this and it's

409
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:32,520
not the game itself there's nothing wrong game is just a machine in the

410
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:36,540
upkeep of it at roseville's is growing up he and i hate the key i hate the

411
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,260
people that go to roseville gobbling

412
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,500
roseville golf will be wonderful with the nuclear holocaust hit it

413
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,420
and only me and my friends survived

414
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,580
now would be great if it took a grant of pay

415
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:50,660
uh... honestly yes so uh... you know uh... i had an okay time

416
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,180
That's that's really all I feel like sharing this Mario Kart

417
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:59,120
Mario Kart's okay. I mean I I didn't play it. They have any other games new games. I heard the wolves

418
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,740
I wanted to play a wagon a wagon midnight maximum

419
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:07,240
What was it that fucking all the thugs were on that yet about the road one of the Roseville theaters

420
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:12,740
This was that time crisis for I haven't checked it out or not time crisis for house. How's that? Yeah, no

421
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:16,420
I haven't checked it out. That's a UCD that one spike was here last week

422
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,180
And I believe told us that was at century

423
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:23,380
Wherever Nightwatch is playing in Roseau because that's what they went and saw so that's what he where he would have seen it hmm

424
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:26,580
So oh, this is funny because um

425
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:34,100
Out there in the living room right now everything is labeled in Russian because extra fur is learning Russian and

426
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,040
Loki's fiance is teaching it to him and

427
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:43,540
So they've taken index cards and labeled everything in the living room in Russian and like it actually has to stay up for like a couple

428
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:46,560
weeks so that should be interesting you're going to be learning you're

429
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,480
very like I don't know how to read it your front room looks like a rushing

430
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,300
kindergarten it does it was a Russian kindergarten right now it's kind of

431
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:57,720
scary but you need to buy some beats some fresh beats I'll listen to some

432
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:02,800
tattoo that's what I'll do fresh beats in your house if I lose vodka if I

433
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,360
listen I listen to a lot of tattoo I'm either gonna learn Russian or become a

434
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:11,440
lesbian one of the two I mean a fake lesbian dark Sakura how was your week

435
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:17,560
Oh Confusion Friday night was badass by the way. Yes it was. We had a good time picture hoarded up. It was great. Mistress Tia

436
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,680
Love her. I actually I ripped off some of my pictures too. I was

437
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:28,060
Confusion was probably the most was the highlight of my week because the rest of my week was shit

438
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:32,560
Oh, I'm sorry, by the way, just a quick FYI Jason wanted me to let you know that the pictures are up

439
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,920
So I'm gonna grab them and I'll send them to you later. Cool cuz I need the one. There's a pic that

440
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:40,160
extra partook of me with the camera of doing the too much metal for one hand

441
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,920
I'll get him from Jason and I'm pretty sure I don't need my space photo okay

442
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,960
that I should check he usually puts all my stuff in a he has a website on my

443
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:52,360
space playing a bass which is what I was doing last night cool I went over to miss

444
00:33:52,360 --> 00:34:00,640
Tia's house apartment to uh now I am I am a vegetarian now except for fish I

445
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:06,320
will eat fish but um I we have to every so often because me and Tia and her

446
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:12,320
roommate Jovan are like the Sacramento Southern collection so we had fried

447
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,640
chicken and biscuits and red beans and rice and mashed potatoes and gravy

448
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:22,840
homemade no Popeyes which is close enough very close very very southern so

449
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:26,120
we all were getting our fried chicken on and of course because I haven't eaten a

450
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:30,420
lot of meat and a lot at eating at whatever meat and a long time the

451
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:33,920
chicken made me very sick but I was all happy and we were watching the the best

452
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,800
little whorehouse in Texas and really not getting into it so I started playing

453
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,560
this base that was in their living room and I actually picked out a few lines so

454
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,640
I think I've got some talent for it but I'm supposed to be getting one of these

455
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:51,680
for my birthday hint hint hint which is next month which still depresses me the

456
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:58,320
So the rest of my week, I blew off school because I was just all, you know, whatever.

457
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:06,920
And then I decided that because for background, for people, I don't have a lot of free time.

458
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,200
As in, I have no free time.

459
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:14,920
So I dropped a class so that I would not completely lose my sanity and my health.

460
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,800
I dropped color theory also because going in that classroom makes me have headaches

461
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,320
from acrylic paint fumes.

462
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,600
Fun, huh?

463
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:26,920
So I'm going to be taking it next spring and working part time, blah blah blah.

464
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,400
Sometimes you have to make those sacrifices for your health.

465
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:37,820
Unfortunately it's going to keep me in school for another, I'd say at least another semester.

466
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:43,000
So and then that's really what my week has been is me trying to decide whether or not

467
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,420
I was going to drop that class.

468
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,160
And so I did.

469
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,800
I'm an academic failure.

470
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,000
I have a W on my transcript now.

471
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:58,520
a big deal based on looking at by the way is a LP the veteran I don't know

472
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:03,280
somebody posted a picture to my myspace of a Batsmaru guitar it's so hard I know

473
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,720
about the Batsmaru bass and the ratings on it are not the best a couple of them

474
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:15,200
that I'm looking at. But it's a Batsmaru bass. Didn't we see that? You don't buy it cuz it looks good you buy it cuz it

475
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:20,960
sounds good whatever you can always paint it or finish it or put stickers on it or

476
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,000
something you and i have painfully uh painfully different priorities

477
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,080
all right uh we're ready to get to the chat room if use are you are you all

478
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:34,160
wrapped up for the record i'm not a vegetarian for ethical reason i'm

479
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,080
i don't eat meat because it makes me sick

480
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,740
let's get to the chat room at views

481
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:48,180
so

482
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:52,520
mister black will fight to say f you to my guitar hero controller who decided

483
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,620
last week that the green button was going to no longer work

484
00:36:55,620 --> 00:37:01,800
even though it looks just fine when i take it apart

485
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,320
and jaded 2006 would like to say F you to my DDR pad sensor

486
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,080
taking a crap last night in the middle of the game

487
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,000
could be nasty to step in

488
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,600
uh... dark knight would like to say F you to my job

489
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,400
uh... for being so frickin hot today

490
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:24,200
and F you to me for not getting out more often and enjoy life

Frickin' Xbox 360. Removing Judas Priest stickers from your base does not make you any less gay.

531
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,000

Tally Hall did get quite a bit of love, but not enough, unfortunately, in the Azoic.

They got true love!

549
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,860
Everybody forgot about the Azoic, apparently.

550
