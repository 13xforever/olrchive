202574	203099	Thanks for watching!
252673	259734	We're back with Orange Lounge Radio, the afterbirth, the part of the show where we keep things going here that's too hot for the podcast.
260635	264776	Just, you know, all the personal stuff, stuff about our personal lives.
264796	269977	You know, tonight's show is actually very long, though, so we don't have a whole lot of time, and we do want to do a cage match tonight.
270450	271351	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
301010	303073	Which makes me very relieved.
303313	306818	The first night there, we went to Waffle House, which Dan wasn't thrilled about.
306858	308880	But I was like, Ash Browns!
309781	310863	So I had Waffle House.
310923	313907	And then the next day, we went to Cracker Barrel, which Dan liked.
314307	317932	And I had fried okra and fried catfish and fried everything else.
319398	332326	And we went to see my ex-roommates, my mama-san and my papa-san, who took care of me during a really difficult time.
333367	339650	And we went to the Atlanta Bread Company for dinner that night, but we weren't before closing, so they weren't all that great.
340131	342552	And then Steak and Shake, where their food is awful.
342892	344733	They have chili on the spaghetti.
345114	347095	Yes, you can get full-on marinara sauce and chili.
348228	348808	on the spaghetti.
349209	349689	It's horrible.
350849	354391	Their fries are awful, but their milkshakes are the best ever.
354831	362315	They do this thing called the side-by-side, which I had a banana and dark chocolate milkshake and mixed them, and it was fabulous.
362975	365796	I did not eat my Blue Bell ice cream, but I did have boiled peanuts.
368018	372800	We also ate at a place called Cooper T's, and it's a very weird thing sharing beer with my brother
373735	377396	He's going to be 22 this month.
377476	380997	Happy birthday, Matt.
381197	384578	I also found out my brother Phillip is on a naval boat.
385118	385558	He's a Marine.
386698	388879	Somewhere in Asia, somewhere.
389979	399021	He's supposed to be going, I think, to Hokkaido, then down to Okinawa, then around the China coast, and then back home.
399961	401342	Doing something or the other, I don't know.
402102	403222	I just told him to bring me back stuff.
404728	408811	and we also went to the Mobile Museum of Art, which was very nice.
408851	413934	There was a lot of local art there too, as well as some very nice classics.
413974	415995	There was even a couple of Renoir there.
416796	417476	Really nice stuff.
419758	420358	We also...
424639	425840	I was actually born in Dothan.
426660	435465	We went to go see my dad and my granny, and they conveniently forgot that I am on a low-carb eating plan and vegetarian, so they had steak and pecan pie.
436765	438266	I ate some steak to make my daddy happy.
438586	441868	It was pretty good, made me very ill, and pecan pie, which was very yummy.
443189	449132	And it was very interesting meeting my dad's new fianc√©e, one of several.
450372	451013	She was nice, though.
451053	451393	I like her.
452108	452908	Maybe they'd be happy.
453448	454009	And we went back.
454049	455009	I had my bowl of peanuts.
455509	457009	We went and ate at Ruby Tuesday's.
458230	461431	The next day, we go to Winslow's Oyster House.
462271	463891	I eat fried oysters, and I'm happy.
463951	465552	My uncle's there, gives us Mardi Gras stuff.
466752	468333	And then we flew home that day.
469353	471013	Very, very horrible plane ride.
471033	477135	I was up in the air for six hours, running into a headwind with massive turbulence.
477395	480676	It was to suck, but I did watch most of Hellboy.
481809	483431	That movie's pretty cool.
484432	488977	And, of course, Dan played lots of Phoenix Wright, and I played lots of Animal Crossing.
490960	491580	I went on a trip.
492061	492862	I went to Virginia.
493022	493823	Did you have a nice fall?
494303	494884	Um, shut up.
496124	498825	Here's a list of things I did for the first time that might make you a little bit proud.
500246	501467	Remember, we're from the West Coast.
501487	503148	We don't have some of this stuff, so it's all new to us.
503668	504508	I ate at a Sonic.
505149	506169	I've never eaten at a Sonic before.
506229	506969	Pretty good.
506989	508030	They have a wide selection of stuff.
508050	508850	There's one in Yuba City.
509251	512912	Yeah, but I still have never eaten there, and that's 40 minutes away for those playing along at home.
512932	517194	There's one that's going in by Arco.
517395	519936	It's not bad, so, you know, check it out.
519956	520796	It's across from the Hooters.
521076	522297	Okay, here's the other thing.
522417	524098	I ate at a Chick-fil-A for the first time.
525401	525962	Thanks for watching!
536423	536883	A.K.A.
536903	537464	Carl's Jr.
538904	539345	Carl's Jr.
539565	540285	is nasty.
540525	541165	No, Carl's Jr.
541185	542086	is way better than Hardee's.
542126	543727	No, I'm saying it's Carl's Jr.
543827	544327	but nasty.
544367	546368	Yeah, you guys on the East Coast, you have it.
546488	547489	Sorry, Carl's Jr.
547529	547989	is way better.
548189	549189	Did you go to Crystal?
549289	550430	Three words, Western Bacon.
550910	551771	No, they didn't have that there.
551911	554032	Or at least I didn't find it.
554172	555212	Let's see, what else did I do in Virginia?
555513	556633	I went to an aquarium there.
557353	558014	Let me just put it this way.
558034	560295	The coolest thing at the aquarium was the birdcage.
561653	562434	You go figure that one out.
563434	564455	And I went to the beach.
564475	566197	That was the first time I'd really been to the East Coast Beach.
566297	569820	No, I did it a second time because I went to Fire Island years ago.
570760	572822	No, just a couple of years ago I went to Fire Island very randomly.
572862	573803	Get your mind out of the gutter.
574083	576045	We just walked around the beach, if you know what that is.
577915	581318	And if you know what that is, hats off to you.
582900	584541	I guess, let's see, what else did I do in Virginia?
584561	585002	Not a lot.
585042	586563	I camped out in the hotel most of the time.
586984	588145	I ate and ate a lot of food.
588185	590547	I gained about five pounds on my trip, so I'm not proud of that.
591388	592769	But I'll be working it off pretty soon.
594851	595532	That's pretty much it.
595552	596513	That's all I really want to share.
597193	597714	It was cold.
598094	598454	You know what?
598494	600016	For the first time in my life,
601550	602031	We found a DJ.
624033	630537	I quit Final Fantasy XI, and that was pretty tough.
632138	632939	What happened to the shell?
633019	634500	Are you able to pass that off to somebody else?
635060	635400	No.
636501	644026	So they better be careful who they add, because they can't delete anybody, and they can't create new... They'll just create another shell, I don't care, whatever.
644651	648572	Um, and then, I played a lot of Full Auto.
648912	653673	I didn't play any Animal Crossing, and I'm tired of that game already.
654534	670318	And, um, I don't know, it's been pretty much just a lot of getting last minute wedding stuff done, starting to send out the invitations, and I was figuring out the last bit of stuff, got the cake flavors picked out.
672418	678082	And I'm supposed to be getting a bachelor party sometime in early April.
682787	688592	Mainly I'm just work stuff, trying to catch up, trying to win my VIP pass to E3.
690213	693676	I don't know if I am, seeing as I'm 30 accounts behind someone else.
694637	698761	Because, well, I just haven't had good luck with my territory.
698781	699161	It's rigged.
699930	700890	Yes, it is rigged.
701170	703031	I am pretty certain that it is rigged.
703091	709933	But I'm going to beg them for a VIP pass anyways because I deserve it.
710713	713834	Whereas the other guy doesn't know what the hell he would do with it.
714514	717054	So I should be able to get one.
717094	718275	I mean, fuck.
718295	720715	Some of my managers are getting them and they don't play games.
720735	721936	They don't even know anything about games.
722696	725177	So hopefully I'll be able to swing that.
725197	726637	Otherwise we've got to get a media pass.
727176	729018	Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition needs to be harder.
729038	729799	But isn't it hot, though?
729819	730239	Oh, yeah.
730579	731120	No, it's awesome.
731140	732642	That's hot.
732662	734243	That game is hot, but yeah.
749571	751192	I thought it had a harder difficulty in that.
751432	757616	It's the same as the old hard difficulty, just renamed Super Hard, and then there's a new Super Easy mode.
758816	760037	Well, why don't you play through it?
760057	760938	That's kind of weird.
761098	764600	They need to name them and do them according to the Doom model.
765300	768282	Hurt Me Plenty, Nightmare, you know, and make them equally hard.
768722	776367	You know what I was so sad is when they announced that whole Rockstar Table Tennis thing, the whole tease of it was...
777128	782510	No, we've got news of a game that's coming to the 360 that you would never expect to hear.
782530	784411	And I was like, Duke Nukem Forever.
784771	785691	Duke Nukem Forever.
785951	786552	Come on!
786632	787852	It's gonna be Duke Nukem Forever!
788532	788672	No.
790833	791133	Alright.
792294	792594	Anything else?
793140	794762	Not really, my whole life is video games.
794802	795402	It's sad.
795823	796483	No, that's awesome.
796703	797324	You're hardcore.
797804	799025	That's why you're the guest tonight.
799166	800347	Because we know you're hardcore.
800387	801848	We feel, we see it in your soul.
802729	805251	Alright, um... That's right, rock.
806092	808134	Anyway, let's get to the cage match.
808274	808694	I know, I don't know
835780	839681	So anyway, the way the cage match works is that we're going to play three songs for you guys.
839701	845383	You guys pick your favorite, and it goes into rotation all week long on Orange Moms Radio's video game and other music programs.
846964	851065	www.orangemomsradio.com, click on chat, be in the chat room, vote, play along.
851126	852226	Three songs, here we go.
852626	854207	Loki, what's the first song we're going to hear tonight?
854547	855247	You won your first.
856180	858322	Um, I honestly don't remember.
858582	859222	Here's a hint.
859322	861323	Distorted reality with Super Crush.
861583	868227	Oh yeah, this is a song that I found on Amazon because the original song I was looking for, I couldn't find a website that I could pirate it from.
868287	871089	So, this is, uh, yeah.
871249	872590	I don't even know what this sounds like.
872690	875772	So, it's another random song that I picked out of the middle of nowhere.
875852	877033	Goody Goody Gumdrops.
877053	878573	Hey, it worked last time.
878654	881075	So, will the magic work again of randomness?
882150	885573	Song number one from Loki tonight, distorted reality with Super Crush.
885633	885914	Enjoy.
946903	948404	Thank you for watching!
1016191	1017494	Thank you for watching!
1052233	1058461	When you search for truth you'll find Nothing but your empty mind I will die for you someday With the way I'm afraid
1118527	1119388	You bow, crow,
1147682	1151344	Yo, that was song number one tonight, Distorted Reality with Super Crush.
1151384	1155765	Let's see what the folks in the studio thought of it, but remember, it's not up to us, it's up to you.
1155785	1156866	DarkSakura.
1157586	1158166	It was cool.
1159787	1164229	It was cool, just a little repetitive, but it gets a 7.5.
1164389	1166090	Generic goth club song for me, 6.
1167150	1171552	Loki, gets an 8, because, yeah, I don't know why.
1171892	1173353	I've first ever heard it, so, yeah.
1173793	1174013	All right.
1174577	1177538	Let's move on to song number two tonight, which comes to us from DarkSakura.
1177558	1178478	What did you pick for us tonight?
1180598	1181678	It was the Afterbirth.
1183099	1190240	However, last time, however, so many people said that it should have been my Gage Match song that I put it in the Gage Match today.
1190740	1193341	So it's Compressor and Empty Frontalot.
1194421	1195241	And what's the name of this song?
1195281	1199742	It's Rappers We Crush.
1199982	1200182	Yep.
1200502	1203843	All right, here it is, Rappers We Crush by Compressor featuring Empty Frontalot.
1203863	1204083	Enjoy.
1227679	1228700	All right, I'm a freak.
1261787	1264151	The Wheel of the Lead Traveller visits your fear.
1264211	1266655	Red and yellow eyes, black gloves gripping the steer.
1293228	1294293	Thanks for watching!
1324064	1325445	What did I do to deserve this?
1325465	1326365	What was my crime?
1326385	1328767	Was it because I sampled the Totem Hose in that one time?
1328867	1349100	And I'm reviewing my life, cowered under a grease trap The boot flap, steppin' ever closer with this click clap Now he's here, now he's crouching down, jaws creak, open hips start pouring out And just as my flesh is about to get devoured, I wake up screaming Wrapped in the sour sweat, stained sheets, takes a minute to get up Stumble to the table, read the paper, clear my head up
1352068	1353557	Caption AM, take me by Jim Henson
1398339	1402601	Song number two tonight, Compressor, featuring MC Frontalot with Rappers We Crush.
1403062	1404182	What do you think about that song?
1404262	1407104	Is it great, or do you just want to crush it with your fists?
1407324	1407964	DarkSakura.
1408265	1408605	Nine.
1408625	1410186	Any reason?
1411046	1412647	I was actually saying no in German.
1413107	1413608	Oh, gotcha.
1415489	1416269	The number nine, too.
1416429	1417630	Okay.
1417850	1425054	I would have to say, you know, I think I liked it better last time I heard it, but it's got clever lyrics, which I like about it, because they rap about, like, Muppets, and that's pretty hardcore.
1425790	1429453	So I'm going to give it... I definitely want to give it higher than the last one, but not by much.
1429473	1429894	So seven.
1430695	1430995	Loki.
1431575	1432956	That's going to get a six.
1433157	1435479	I don't care for MC Frontalot at all.
1436219	1436580	All right.
1437320	1438821	Let's get into song number three tonight.
1438861	1441724	Song number three is my pick, and I love this band.
1441744	1445167	They were in Ultramix 3, and they have a remix album coming out soon.
1445207	1448029	It's the Azoic, and this song is called Going Under.
1448089	1449350	It's a kinetic mix.
1449571	1449951	Enjoy.
1449971	1450091	Enjoy.
1673618	1676961	Song number three tonight, the Ezoic going under Kinetic Mix.
1677041	1679162	Let's see what the kids thought of that one.
1679203	1679963	DarkSakura.
1680864	1683806	Um, better than your usual picks.
1685848	1686709	Aw, how sweet.
1687649	1688750	I mean, seriously.
1688850	1691532	I mean, it sounded less generic, so I guess an eight.
1691773	1693094	All right.
1693114	1693694	Uh, moving on.
1693974	1696036	Loki, what'd you think of the Ezoic going under Kinetic Mix?
1696056	1696897	Kind of average.
1697397	1697657	Seven.
1697677	1698478	All right.
1699643	1703825	I like that mix, but I think I like the original one slightly better, so it gets an 8 from me.

1746068	1748710	You don't have much time, so frickin' hurry up.
1749110	1750592	Frickin' hurry with it.
1751012	1757197	Okay, now that we're in the afterbirth, now I suppose we can talk about the Oscars a little bit.
1758362	1760323	Meek Latav, I see you lurking back there.
1760343	1761743	Want to come on the show for a little bit?
1763243	1764384	You just want your iPod?
1764664	1765324	I see how you are.
1765344	1767904	Yeah, I'll make you work for it.
1767964	1768265	Come here.
1770505	1771185	Where's the microphone?
1771705	1772506	There it is on the ground there.
1774066	1775306	Are you mad about the Oscars?
1775326	1777847	Because I heard that Crash won and not Brokeback Mountain.
1777947	1785129	I can't be mad about the Oscars because they were obviously just the joke Oscars since that pimp song won Best Song.
1785209	1785709	Did it really?
1785729	1786009	Yeah.
1787173	1788874	Have you seen Hustle and Flow, though?
1788914	1790715	It is actually supposed to be pretty good.
1791816	1795118	Granted, I don't watch those type of movies, but it is supposed to be...
1796016	1796556	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1819262	1821104	I fell out of love with the Oscars years ago
1834256	1846202	and, please don't get me wrong, Crash was a really good movie, and Brokeback Mountain was a really good movie, but, you know what, there were thousands, you know, I'm sure there were lots of, maybe not thousands, but there were lots of good movies this year, and who's to say... Saw 2 should have won.
1846222	1847762	Saw 2 totally should have won.
1847802	1848843	Saw 2 was amazing.
1848923	1849223	Fuck.
1849343	1850243	Who won the Razzies?
1850283	1851484	Now, those... Was it crazy?
1852264	1854025	Those are... It was, it was pretty... Saw 2.
1854065	1855126	Saw 2 was pretty good, actually.
1855146	1856766	We didn't even look to see who won a Razzie.
1857467	1858347	We didn't even look to see... Yeah, he did.
1858527	1858887	He did.
1858967	1860448	Yeah, I think he won it for Blood Rain.
1860668	1861429	I'm sure he did.
1862089	1862269	Well...
1863931	1872217	I really didn't care about the Oscars this year because I figured Brokeback would probably lose even though it deserved to win out of what was there.
1873218	1874399	And so it's like, whatever.
1874659	1875800	The pimps won.
1876260	1877942	The racists won.
1878822	1879303	It's fine.
1879623	1880944	How was Jon Stewart as host?
1882353	1884416	I heard he made an appearance or something
1899378	1904622	A commercial saying how this audio engineer doesn't deserve to win, but this audio engineer does.
1905383	1906564	Like a political commercial.
1907144	1907704	It's pretty funny.
1907985	1911827	But most of the time, I actually didn't watch the Oscars.
1912168	1916491	I flipped to it to see a couple of the awards that I mostly watched.
1916511	1918873	Weren't you guys watching a Law & Order marathon?
1919213	1921675	If I was in the living room right now, I'd still be watching Law & Order.
1922295	1925458	Unfortunately for you guys, I don't think Uevo won.
1926423	1928245	The winner for Worst Picture is Dirty Love.
1934148	1936410	Worst Actor goes to Rob Schneider.
1937430	1940452	Worst Actress would be Jenny McCarthy, also in Dirty Love.
1940652	1941653	She's awesome, though.
1942053	1946236	Worst Supporting Actor, Hayden Christensen in Star Wars Episode III.
1946817	1950339	Worst Supporting Actress, Paris Hilton in House of Wax.
1950439	1952460	And they spell wax wrong, that's funny.
1952921	1957764	And then Worst On-Screen Couple, Will Ferrell, Nicole Kidman in Bewitched.
1958324	1961026	Worst Sequel or Remake, Son of the Mask.
1962270	1964954	and Worst Website, the Razzie Awards.
1965034	1965715	Imagine that.
1965775	1967077	Look at that crap website.
1968018	1969900	It looks like it was made in Angel Fire.
1972864	1979774	Here, plug, I know you can't talk about anything that goes on at Konami because of NDAs and stuff, but plug your favorite board game.
1980474	1980654	Oh!
1981975	1984076	Apples to Apples is the best war game.
1984116	1986177	It has actually taken over break time at work.
1986637	1988799	Mario Kart is no longer the reigning champion.
1988919	1991740	We play Apples to Apples because it's really, really fun.
1991760	1992340	That was quite fun.
1992380	1994141	Really quickly, what do you do in Apples to Apples?
1995042	1996002	You judge people.
1997603	1999864	That's pretty much what you do.
2000625	2009029	There's this judge and he puts down an adjective card and then everybody else looks at the cards in their hands and they're all nouns and then they place what they think
2009696	2012257	The judge thinks would be the best match.
2012617	2017959	And then the judge picks up all the cards, looks at them, and then he awards a point to what he thinks is the best.
2018239	2022280	But the main part of the game is saying why you don't think certain cards should win.
2022820	2025421	And if you're you, who likes to judge everybody.
2025741	2026621	Yeah, pretty much.
2026721	2027842	That's why it's fun.
2028662	2028962	All right.
2029955	2032857	Let's announce the winner of tonight's cage match so we can wrap this show up here.
2032897	2033417	You guys ready?
2034017	2036819	This is a very, very close cage match tonight, might I say.
2036879	2047285	One of the closer ones in years because one vote separated the winner from the runner-up and then one vote separated the runner-up from third place.
2047485	2049427	So all three songs were very neck and neck.
2049927	2052729	But in the end, there can be only one.
2053549	2054790	And tonight's winner is...
2060058	2063261	I won stinking vote over Compressor.
2063401	2070707	Two stinking votes over... Just like the Oscars, the one that's most fresh in the minds of the voters is the one that won.
2070767	2074070	I bought all those votes, but I actually placed an ad in Variety this week.
2074390	2077493	For your consideration, the Ezoic going under Kinetic.
2078093	2081356	Best supporting song on an internet radio station.
2082557	2082957	Lovely.
2086740	2087501	It's time to wrap up.
2087561	2088321	Now I'm getting tired.
2088361	2088922	I'm worn out.
2089252	2090473	You haven't done chatroom FUs.
2091534	2092054	Oh, that's right.
2092134	2092595	Oh, okay.
2093155	2093956	I will solicit.
2094056	2095497	I will allow chatroom FUs.
2095998	2097059	One each.
2097459	2098420	Yeah, one each.
2099100	2099981	We'll take the first five.
2100061	2100561	That's right.
2101843	2102283	So hurry up.
2102303	2106306	Send a private message to Sky with your chatroom FUs and we'll hook that up.
2108548	2111070	What can we talk about in the meantime?
2111210	2112011	What else is going on?
2112471	2112912	I don't know.
2113472	2114073	Taxes.
2114633	2115514	I'm getting money.
2116105	2118906	That's how I managed to buy the iBook.
2118946	2121608	$1,200 from federal and $200 from state.
2121788	2122148	Nice.
2122968	2125049	I actually started having them withhold a lot of money.
2126090	2140237	I turned on the cabinet this weekend and then turned it back off because I got yelled at for turning on the cabinet while people were in the house and distracting the guests and not socializing with people.
2141877	2142117	I know.
2142938	2145139	I just sent Dan out to the garage to play the meme.
2146363	2147888	We have ours built out of a stand-up composition.
2147908	2148851	I feel so uncool.
2148892	2151641	I'm the only OLR host with no main cabinets.
2152455	2154256	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2178911	2179411	That's stupid.
2179431	2180973	Have you seen the little ones at Target, though?
2180993	2181713	The little baby ones?
2182013	2182614	No.
2182694	2183454	They're interesting.
2183574	2185156	I mean, they're still a little pricey for me.
2185216	2187237	I don't think I'd have one, but, you know.
2188558	2192501	I want to make more of my interfaces, but I just don't have them in the store.
2192661	2207392	I need to get into a new apartment or a new condo or whatever so that we have our own bedroom dedicated to the cabinet so I can dump them in the closet because, unfortunately, each interface is like six feet wide or, no, four feet wide and
2208759	2209380	It's just too big.
2209840	2210761	You know what I want?
2211601	2221308	Because we had Bobby on the show tonight from All Games, and he was talking about on another show about how he went to Media Play, because you know all the Media Play stores went under?
2221708	2226251	And he freaking got one of those PlayStation 2 kiosks that you have in the store.
2226711	2228072	Yeah, he got one of those in his house.
2228172	2229253	We have an Xbox One.
2229713	2229973	Really?
2230053	2230434	God!
2230654	2232295	Those are about two grand.
2232717	2233597	They're pretty expensive.
2233877	2234798	Oh my god, really?
2235238	2238919	Yeah, because I've actually... I can tell you that's probably not what he paid for it.
2238999	2245262	I have a thing for Microsoft because they were pimping out their... The kiosk before the 360 was coming out.
2245682	2248003	And they were like five grand for those.
2248043	2249943	They have really detailed ones.
2250223	2253084	Bob, he's going to link a picture right now so you guys can see it in his house.
2253765	2255445	I think he said he was playing Guitar Hero on it or something.
2255465	2255805	I don't remember.
2255825	2256626	Well, that's another thing.
2256666	2260267	I've got to set up Guitar Freaks on mine eventually.
2260803	2264965	And now that they've got actual DDR games running under MAME, that should be pretty cool.
2266546	2268947	What else was... There was something else I was going to try.
2270108	2270808	That was pretty cool.
2272148	2274169	Oh, he went ahead and told us how much he paid.
2274209	2275330	He paid $500 for it.
2275790	2276471	Yeah, that's pretty good.
2276511	2277571	Wow, that's hardcore, though.
2278331	2281193	I don't know if I could have spent that kind of money, but you go, boy.
2281473	2281993	That's awesome.
2282013	2282313	Here it is.
2282333	2282854	Here's a picture.
2283614	2284494	Hold on, I'm loading it up right there.
2284534	2284794	There it is.
2284875	2285835	Oh, and it's Guitar Hero.
2286195	2286595	Right on there.
2286615	2287176	That's pretty cool.
2287196	2289977	He's got the little eye toy set up there on the top, a little cutout there.
2291001	2291501	That's awesome.
2291721	2294362	Just sitting in the apartment, just chilling.
2296942	2302123	You know you're into games when... Someday, my cabinet will be done.
2302823	2303264	Someday.
2303824	2304664	I've got all the parts.
2305364	2307845	I just need the time and the space to put it in.
2309945	2311325	Someday, it will be mine.
2311585	2314186	Seriously, it's been, like, what, in production for two years now?
2314346	2314546	Yeah.
2314886	2317026	Well, the big... Since I lived with you in that apartment.
2317046	2319027	A brief vacation, though, of course.
2319167	2319607	All right.
2319878	2321058	Let's get to chatroom FUs.
2321258	2322919	All right, you ready for this, DarkSakura?
2323559	2323939	Sure.
2325940	2328941	Um, let's see.
2330502	2335903	MiniMe283 says, F you to the Oscars for not nominating Cinderella Man or Narnia enough.
2337464	2338364	I like Narnia.
2338804	2340365	I thought it was much better than I thought it would be.
2340445	2341425	Cinderella Man I didn't see.
2341445	2342806	I don't like Russell Crowe.
2342826	2346087	NintendoManiac64 said, F you to this bloody nose I got on the toilet.
2346727	2348568	Better a bloody nose than a... Never mind.
2349168	2349288	Um...
2351007	2355852	Ninja Bunny with X's around it says, F you to SUVs because they hit my motorcycle.
2356913	2362518	I want to say F you to this SUV I saw today parked in between spaces at the restaurant.
2362538	2362939	Oh, man.
2363419	2365121	What do those people think they are?
2367203	2370246	DarkTeksuya says, F you to Uebol for finally getting the hint.
2371227	2373509	Popanda21 says, Speaking of dragons...
2374907	2379970	FU to not being able to download Kuro Kuro Rock or Sunday Bloody Sunday without it being messed up.
2380331	2383212	Stupid drama created by my bitches and hoes.
2383613	2384653	Gotta smack a bitch up.
2384954	2386735	And FU to school and college and friction.
2387095	2388676	Burn on penises in the Oscars.
2389036	2389356	Fiend.
2390197	2390837	Where's my music?
2392458	2393779	Thank you.
2393819	2404206	Legend of Zaku says, FU to giving an already intoxicated girl at a party in my apartment a shot of Rumpelmintz since that one got her passed out as well as feeling guilty about giving her the shot.
2406468	2408289	You college kids and your drunkenness.
2408849	2413071	Ranma says, F you to bamaniiso.ws for banning me.
2413632	2416333	I tried to do my share and keep torrents up and I got capped for it.
2416353	2422056	I already got capped twice for sharing torrents for you guys, but y'all ain't paying my cable bills, so fuck you, you fucking pricks.
2422436	2425778	Oh, and FYI, your torrents will always be leaked out to other sites, so suck it.
2426238	2427399	Hey, you want to get back at him?
2427959	2428539	Report him!
2430861	2431321	Turn him in!
2432181	2433722	SSJ100, ruin it for everybody.
2433742	2434322	SSJ100, Matt says...
2436068	2445095	F you to my anti-semitic neighbor who password locked out my network and changed it to secure your network you dumbass Jew and changed my router name to dumb faggot Jew.
2445596	2452061	It took me a long time to fix everything he messed up and get my internet working correctly all because he hates me and my family for being Jewish.
2452441	2454983	That's like real... Can you believe that that exists?
2455003	2455844	That's not funny!
2456084	2457946	Can you believe that that exists in the world?
2459927	2460228	Sick!
2460468	2461789	I'm going home to rename my router.
2463837	2467259	Not everyone is heavily armed or wearing armor so that they'll put up a fight, morons.
2492223	2495306	If there's any chicks there, I wanna do them!
2495326	2498328	That's the other kind of old play.
2499950	2510959	And Tomo-kun, last but not least, says fuck me for not paying attention, fuck Verizon, fuck the creepy guys at the arcade, picking up my 15-year-old friend.
2512000	2515803	Dude, she said she was 17 and a half.
2517405	2520107	That's it for another edition of Orange Lounge Radio to Afterbirth.
2521345	2521625	AskANinja.com
2537011	2539732	You know, we gotta have... If we ever become a TV show, that would be a great thing.
2539752	2541092	Dude, they're bigger than we are already.
2541252	2543353	They've been featured on iTunes, like, four weeks in a row.
2543373	2544453	They were featured on the news!
2544493	2551175	We were featured on iTunes once, and in a dark, black corner somewhere, and, you know, we were lucky to really even get that.
2551675	2554076	But, um, you know, it's just... You know what's funny?
2554116	2557197	They featured a video game podcast, I think, like...
2558373	2561094	Probably four times since iTunes has gone up.
2562015	2565816	The only time we were ever mentioned on iTunes was under Interesting Indies, which is kind of cool.
2566296	2566737	But you know what?
2566757	2569358	The Video Game Podcast, we've never been featured.
2569438	2570678	Bobby's never been featured.
2571199	2572619	I don't know if All Games Interactive was.
2572879	2573400	Maybe once.
2574020	2575821	But you know who most of them are that get featured?
2576721	2583324	G4 Replays, the X-Play Podcast, probably Attack of the Show Podcast and all that.
2584512	2588814	You can turn on your TV and watch, which defeats the purpose of podcasting.
2588894	2598139	Actually, no, you couldn't turn your TV on and watch it because they would be playing Star Trek Next Generation, The Man Show, Fastlane, and Banzai.
2598379	2602161	Oh, because that show failed on two different networks.
2603281	2606623	What is it, G4, the place where shows finally go to die?
2607483	2611205	It's like, let's breathe life into them once more and hope that it does well.
2611704	2613225	Don't you miss G4 back when it only kinda sucked?
2629139	2635704	I know, I would have been so much nicer to G4 in the beginning.
2636264	2639866	I would have said, every show on there is awesome, I love it, I'm a big fan of everybody.
2639886	2641848	Or like the electric playground or filter.
2641948	2642308	I know.
2642768	2645070	Like, I love Diane Miazoa, she's my hero.
2646033	2650256	Like, you know... You know, even though I'm gay, she's still pretty hot.
2650516	2651336	I mean, I gotta admit.
2651636	2652037	She is!
2652537	2654498	Have you seen her in the Mario cosplay?
2654558	2656539	Is she the one that counts down things?
2656579	2659621	Yeah, she counts down things on her little show, but it got canned.
2660582	2665364	I think, I wanna say she's on the, uh, I think I saw her on the Andy Grant... Was she on the Andy Grant show?
2665704	2666205	Three Wishes?
2666785	2669507	I don't know, but she's on Trains, Spaces, like, Kids or something.
2671888	2672548	Alright, anyway.
2672568	2675070	Um... That, that, that, that, that, that, that.
2676927	2678108	Small corrections here.
2678468	2685650	Bobby, of course, says that All Games Interactive actually was featured on iTunes once, but it was under New and Notable.
2686531	2692813	So that's what makes this little partnership we have going on interesting, is that neither one of us are good enough to be featured as a video game podcast.
2692893	2695694	And I use good enough with loose quotes there, as you know.
2696246	2699447	Put Morgan Webb on your album art and shit, you'll be featured every week.
2699767	2701908	She's really awesome, though, but has a small head.
2701988	2702608	She is.
2704569	2707610	That's the one thing I got out of E3 that year.
2708350	2709450	Her head is really tiny.
2709470	2710230	The show's over.
2710530	2720293	Yeah, I got his autograph, like, at the Nintendo Power Fest in, like, 19- I still want to know what dumpster our sampler CD ended up in, Loki.
2724375	2724795	I don't know.
2724835	2725375	They probably, like,
2726944	2729705	G4 was also the channel that brought us video game vixens.
2760525	2762727	Hey, at least that has something to do with video games.
2762927	2763547	That's a good point.
2763888	2766170	Alright, we're done with G4 bashing, honestly.
2766290	2768572	That's so, you know, yesterday.
2769552	2772095	Anyway, let's get this show done with.
2772135	2773296	Here's your fortune cookie message.
2773376	2775037	Oh, final, final, final, final thoughts.
2775097	2775538	Mikotov.
2776458	2779241	The new Power Ranger sucks, except for the Green Ranger.
2780702	2781663	Don't look at me like that.
2782023	2784325	Spike, final, final, final, super duper last thought.
2786907	2787548	If you have anything.
2789653	2791515	Tommy Tallarico's just way too short.
2794317	2795057	Uh, Loki.
2795398	2805065	What the hell was that really crappy show that was on that station that featured, like, the MMO skits and that guy named Dave who talked to a computer that didn't really exist?
2805125	2807487	Wasn't that, um, um... Portal!
2807707	2808828	Goddamn Portal suck!
2808968	2810249	Never mind, I take it all back!
2810430	2811290	Portal fucking suck!
2811310	2811711	No, you know what?
2811731	2812071	You know what?
2812451	2814493	I would rather have that.
2815433	2817554	I would rather have that than what we have now.
2817814	2819634	And I take back everything I said.
2820875	2822555	DarkSakura, final thought.
2823956	2825256	Um, hi.
2827116	2833038	And my final super-duper last bit thought is, um... I broke the mic.
2833638	2834319	Good night, everybody.
2834599	2835779	Here's your fortune cookie message of the day.
