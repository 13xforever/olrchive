Yummy!
We're back here with the Afterbirth, and you know, I think this might be one of the longest shows on the records for us here at Orange Lounge Radio.
We're almost already to 9 o'clock, so kind of interesting.
Alright, so we've got a lot of stuff we want to cover here in the Afterbirth.
Let's go ahead and start off with a little bit of how was your week, how was your day, really quickly go around and see what's going on in our personal lives.
Remember, the Afterbirth, this is the portion that is...
DarkSakura.com
And then went to the grocery store.
Other than that, I sprained my wrist last Friday, which I might have mentioned on the show.
Because my cat was being a retard.
And I was leaning over to pet her and balancing myself on the chair as I was getting up.
And she bumped into my leg, knocked me just enough off balance.
And my wrist is a little sore now.
It's actually better.
But I couldn't play anything all week except Ragnarok.
It really got on my nerves.
However, you know, I did play a lot of Ragnarok.
I also, I have homework that I've been putting off all week that I didn't do today.
Good job.
Yeah, I'm really responsible.
So it's going to be turned in late.
And really that's about it.
I've just had a very busy week.
Alright.
Extifer, how was your week?
How was your day?
The week was fine.
I was sick a couple days out of the week, but it's already passed and everything.
I went back to Final Fantasy XI after you guys all went back, and I decided, okay, well, I'll try a different character.
So I'm not a white mage anymore, and I'm not a black mage anymore.
I'm a thief.
So yay, thieves.
Thieves.
Because you know what?
I...
Play a rogue in World of Warcraft and it's pretty much the same thing.
Anyways, and then today I had a good time with my boyfriend.
Actually, I had a really good time with my boyfriend this whole weekend.
And... Yay.
Shut up.
And we went to the video games live on Friday, which was cool.
So, yay, boyfriend.
Loki, how was your week?
How was your day?
My week is okay.
Um...
What did I do this week?
Shit.
Um... Well, no, I don't think I did anything too important.
I did play more Oblivion.
That was fun.
And, um, tomorrow I'm supposed to be going to get a marriage license.
And so I'm actually taking the day off.
And that's only going to take about half an hour.
But I have to drive up to Plasterville and that's like, what, like an hour... No, not an hour away, but like 30 minutes away.
And no one likes going to Plasterville.
It's like, you know...
Hickville
Just, oh, and of course we went down to San Jose and that was fun.
And that was really cool.
And the quasi, now I gotta mention though, when we were at Genji, there's, it is basically your Benihana's type of restaurant.
It's a teppanyaki.
Yeah, where they, you know, cook in front of you.
But they did, Benihana's does this thing where they make like a volcano out of the onions.
Now, Genji took it one step further, that put them on top, as far as the onion section goes, with me.
And that would be that they took the onion, and they made a little volcano, and they poured the water in there, and then it caused the same, ooh, volcano!
Well, then he took, you know, alcohol, poured the alcohol in there, and lit it on fire, and that was freaking sweet.
They do that at another place in town, called Katana.
Well, I don't care.
This is just cool.
Other than that, no, I didn't do too much else.
All right.
My week and my day was okay.
I was still really sick this week with my sinus infection.
It just kind of kept me down for a little while, and I didn't really get to go to the gym at all, which kind of pissed me off.
But I'm better now.
Yesterday was my first day.
It was zero meds, zero anything, so I feel much better now.
Thank you very much.
And otherwise, I've been doing a lot of gaming because, you know, just everything on the 360 and the DS and Final Fantasy and all that stuff, good times.
And...
I guess, Tuesday we already pretty much talked about, that was a great night Put down my DS, Extifer, what are you doing?
No!
What are you playing?
Extifer?
I think Tetris Alright Dork, alright, anyway Great radio
Xtifer's Movie Review
V for Vendetta
And I also want to get the t-shirt that has the snakes and then plus plane equals snakes on a plane.
Okay, when I mentioned snakes on a plane to you, you were like, what is that?
That's stupid.
Well, I still think it's stupid.
I think everybody thinks it's stupid.
That's the point.
It's snakes on a plane.
Yeah, and I want to see it now.
But the movie itself, it was really well done.
It really has a lot of important issues in it that I think kind of pertain to today's current events and everything.
And I think everybody should see it.
I think it's better than The Matrix.
It's from the people who brought out The Matrix.
And I wasn't a big fan of The Matrix.
But I really liked this movie a lot.
I think it's one of the best movies I've seen this year.
So two thumbs up?
Yeah, two big dicks up.
Alright, thank you.
Two snakes up!
Alright.
Let's see, I mentioned there on the Skype line earlier.
Well, first off, we're going to open it back up very soon here.
But on the Skype line earlier, we told one of our callers that we would actually take a look at this live on air.
So I'm going to try and pull this up here.
Let's see if I can locate the file.
It says...
MTV.
Okay, here we go.
So this is that MTV interview.
We haven't done Orange Lounge Radio at the movies in a long time.
So we have this MTV interview with Sketch, who's a DDR player.
Keep in mind, usually when we do Orange Lounge Radio at the movies, we have a chance to watch this clip in advance and kind of prep what we want to say.
But tonight, not the case.
So we're just going to watch this and see how it goes.
So here it is.
Now wait, hold on a minute.
Isn't DDR something that's designed to be played at home?
Kids, I'm gonna warn ya!
I'm stupid.
Okay, well, I'm guessing that he's saying that because this guy is going to do some insane tricks here.
Guys, I apologize for the volume on this video, but the video volume is insanely low.
I have it jacked up as high as it'll go, so you'll just have to deal here for a little bit.
Anyway, let's move on.
Let's see what is so freaking insane about this.
Anyway, moving on.
For most of us, Dance Dance Revolution is something you do for fun.
But for Anthony Carrella here, the New York City DDR champion, quite possibly the best in the world, this is really serious business.
Seriously.
I bet about... No offense to this guy, I don't know him, but I bet there's about 50 people on the internet waiting to dispute this claim.
And you know that there's people jealous that this guy got TV time.
Well, you know what?
It's not like, you know, MTV doing actual research on something.
I'm not going to doubt this guy's good.
I'm just going to say there are going to be 50 people lined up wanting to dispute that claim.
That's all I'm saying.
I just started playing about four years ago.
I found solace in the game because I had a breakup with my girlfriend.
And it's addicting, man.
I can't stop playing.
I just love playing it.
Okay, I'm sorry, that's lame.
Not his reasoning.
They made him play DDR while he's being interviewed.
That is the ultimate in cheeseball.
I'm sorry.
That's really stupid.
Whoever attributed MTV with doing anything really intelligent, other than remote control.
Sometimes me and my friends would wake up at 9 o'clock, go down to Coney Island, play all day.
Go home at 8 o'clock, wake up, do it again.
We would do it for about a week.
It usually runs me, not even a lot, about 20 to 40 bucks every time I go to the arcade.
Which, by the way, you'll notice this guy is one of the skinniest people I've ever seen in my life.
And that's why, right there.
Look at that, he is skinny.
Very, very skinny.
From about 2003 to 2004, I was undefeated in all New York City fair options tournaments.
Yeah, that's because you're on the East Coast.
Oh, burn.
I'm just teasing.
Here comes all the hate mail from the East Coast.
This guy, you asshole.
I'm teasing.
It's a joke.
I'm just starting shit.
I take pride in saying that I'm one of the few people, if not the only person in the world, that could stealth every hard 10-footer in the game backwards.
Meaning I could do it without looking or I could turn the arrows on.
Well, let me put it this way.
If you can stealth it going forward, you can stealth it backwards.
Sorry, I restarted the video.
No, sorry.
And it's addicting, man.
I can't stop playing.
Sorry, you gotta hear some of it over again because I fucked up.
Sometimes me and my friends would...
Wake up at 9 o'clock, go down to Coney Island Fuck that dude, I used to wake up or not wake up I used to go after midnight, go down to CCL and play until 3 in the morning That is pretty hardcore Okay, here comes the stealth line again From about 2003 to 2004, I was undefeated in all New York City fair options tournaments
I take pride in saying that I'm one of the few people, if not the only person in the world, that could stealth every hard 10-footer in the game, backwards.
Meaning I could do it without looking, or I could turn the arrows on.
That just takes some insane memorization.
I mean, you really do have to play the game a lot to know those songs, you know, like the back of your hand.
It's active repetition.
Didn't you say you played so much Love on DDR2 that you could do the same thing?
Yeah.
I used to be able to do that, Diamond Rage.
Dynamite Rave
I'm sorry, I don't know this whole thing, what it's all about, because I've been playing Tetris.
But I just heard him say that and everything, and I'm like, it takes somebody so arrogant and so full of themselves to say that I'm the only person in the world who can do this.
Because I'm pretty sure he's not.
To this guy's credit, though, MTV's probably coaxing this out of him.
You know what I mean?
I know what these interview people can be sometimes, and he's probably... I don't know.
I don't know this guy, so I'm not going to assume anything.
If I work out, I'm not working out to get fit.
I'm working out to see if I could get a better score on a song.
I'm not listening to music.
I'm thinking of ways that I could get better and do things better.
All right, dude.
So you have a huge tournament coming up, the huge championship, right?
You can't train 24 hours a day in an arcade.
So what do you do?
How are you prepping at home?
I got the pad at home.
I'm playing on the pad.
I also have these step charts that I'm looking at.
They're step charts of the hardest songs in the games, cheat sheets if you want to call them.
I'm looking at those patterns and I'm trying to figure out what I'm going to use on people, what I'm not going to use on people.
I'm trying to get my confidence up.
It's not only a physical thing, it's a mental thing.
You think you're going to win this tournament?
I'm winning.
It's not even a question of whether I think I'm going to win or not, I'm winning.
Let me explain to you who these people are.
This is New York's finest, DDPD.
What I'm focused on most is tech, expert.
You ready, Sketch?
I'm ready.
Let's go.
Let's do it.
It's going to be very competitive.
A lot of the best players from the country are in it.
This is the $2,000.
Here we go.
I have the speed mile record for New York City.
I was the first person to get the highest score in the hardest only course in the game, Legend Row, which is a marathon course.
I've cleared over a thousand beats per minute.
I would rank myself up there.
I would rank myself the best.
Me, me, me, me, I, I, I, I. A thousand beats a minute?
Uh, what?
I think he's talking about the arrow scroll speed.
I know, but... Yeah, I know, I know.
Not to sound cocky, but I work hard for it.
Not to sound cocky or anything, but... Did I mention how awesome I am?
We had it taken off.
Hold on, hold on.
Extifer, hold on.
Let's reaffirm something here.
How much about this whole DDR and the culture and everything do you know about?
I don't know that much actually.
My adrenaline is through the roof right now.
Best feeling I've ever had in my life.
Me and my friends are probably going to go and celebrate and this is going to hang in my house and that's how it's going to be.
Yes, you're going to hang the trophy in your house.
It looks like the same type of trophy they give you for Little League.
All right.
Here's some comments from our chat room right now.
Let's see.
Jaded2006 says, LOL, I can do max 300 stealth.
Let's see.
Popanda21, I'm the only person in the world that's perfect.
Let's see.
Sextastical.
Let's see.
Where's the one?
Somebody said something about... Oh, Illusion says, I could clean out my vagina with this guy.
Zaku says, oh, Zaku says, fuck you, man, try doing a ten-footer with six options, Extifer.
Ooh, burn.
He just threw down.
I don't fucking care.
Oh, wait, did I cause controversy?
It's okay.
Why don't you masturbate or something?
It's okay.
If they had, like, someone else in the tournament and he came in, like, third or second or something like that and how this interview would end.
You know, I still don't think he's as cool as the guy who did DDR on crutches.
Alright.
The guy with one leg.
Alright, you asked, we did.
We went ahead and talked about the video on the show.
I don't know if that's... For the record, I still think it's cheating.
I don't know if that's the response you wanted, buddy, but sorry.
We call him as we see him.
I might add, his soft pad that he had at home is...
Red Octane, you know, Wannabe Pad.
They look like crap.
Skypline's open.
Anybody want to call?
Let's just see who gets on there first.
I'm trying to wait for our British guy to call back because I promised we could get him on.
I'm kind of secretly hoping Zach will call back too.
Hey Rob, I'm so awesome, I can pass every song, and I'm perfect.
Shut up, we got a call back.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Simmel again.
Hi Simmel, how you doing?
Oh, no video this time.
That's alright.
How you doing, Simmel?
Yeah, that should sort it out now.
Alright, what's on your mind, buddy?
Just about the DDR Dancer.
Uh-huh.
What about him?
Basically, just one thing.
When he's actually dancing and everything, why doesn't he just spend the $40 a day or whatever he's doing to buy a machine for home?
I don't know.
That's a good question.
Well, you know, it's one of those impulse buy things.
It's harder.
We could probably say the same thing about we pay $30 a month to do this radio show and at that rate we could have bought our own server by now.
You know what I mean?
I can't really talk.
I did.
You built your own machine.
There's a difference between going out and spending $3,000 on a machine and spending... How much did you spend on yours?
$3,000.
That was the exact same conclusion I came to.
I was like, you know, I'm tired of playing an arcade where all the machines are broken, so I'm going to build my own.
And I did.
He doesn't get the recognition that he would get if he's playing it in front of people, so I think it's an arrogance thing, actually.
It's an ego thing.
He wants people around him to feed his ego.
I mean, that's obvious that the way he was talking himself up, that he needed ego fodder.
You know what?
I'm taking this with a grain of salt, because I think...
I think the MTV guys might have embellished it a little bit.
Those words came out of his mouth.
That is true, but I know the power of editing and I think there could be something interesting going on here.
Anyway, what else is on your mind, Simmel?
That's pretty much about it, really.
Okay, well thank you so much for calling back and I'm sorry I didn't work out on the show earlier.
That's okay.
Alright, have a good one, buddy.
Thanks a lot.
Alright, bye-bye.
Bye.
And get some sleep soon.
Alright.
Oh, did I hang up on him?
Oh, whoop.
I hung up on somebody else.
Sorry.
Alright, there we go.
Let's go to this call.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Yeah, it's me.
Yeah, I guess it was a bad idea after all.
I mean, it's alright.
I mean, I can understand the criticism, but that's okay.
I mean, you pretty much called it as you see it.
Okay, play devil's advocate for me, Zaku, because have you met this guy being on the East Coast?
Yes, I've met this guy.
I've hung out with this guy on several occasions.
Was this a fair assessment of him?
Um, he's pretty much, I mean, if you get to know him, he doesn't sound very, he doesn't sound as arrogant as, you know, he doesn't sound, you know, he doesn't sound arrogant at all.
You really know how awesome I am.
He's very humble.
It's just that, you know, when he gets the opportunity for these types of things, he tries to market himself.
But, you know, as I said, once you get to know him, he's pretty much very humble.
He just hates, you know, he doesn't care about what other people says because he doesn't feed into that negativity.
But he knows how to strut his stuff on the catwalk, right?
Yeah, because pretty much he put foot to ass to his skills.
Put it that way.
He didn't just magically get them.
It was a long way up there.
I can respect that.
Four to five years of hard work trying to get up to that level.
And you don't do that by showing off.
You earn people's respect.
You know, this guy doesn't win all the time.
I mean, you know, when he loses, he learns from his mistakes to get better.
And, you know, honestly, people like him are a prime example of what a DDR player should be.
I totally disagree with that.
Well, the best DDR player in the world can be complete jackasses.
That's what we're looking for.
No.
I didn't mean being an asshole or anything.
I just meant as someone who wouldn't blatantly show off.
Someone who's very humble.
I'm sure his dancing backwards and everything.
If he were truly that humble, he wouldn't be such a braggart.
And if you meet him in real life, he can prove that to you.
But the thing is that he's making himself sound like he wins all the time, and you yourself said that he did not.
It depends.
He's one of the best.
But he himself was saying he was the best.
Believe me, there are other people that are up to his level.
And I'm from New York, I would know.
To Zachary, to be fair though, he did say in that video that he was bragging about being the best.
But I'm trying to give this guy a break because I understand that kind of energy that having an MTV person in your house can kind of give you.
You don't get that sort of thing.
You're going to make yourself sound like the shit.
I understand that.
What happened to the Asian people?
Weren't they the best at it?
I honestly would like to see that guy versus Tigger.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
and if willing, you probably will get the chance to interview him.
Can't wait.
Can't wait.
Can't wait to meet him.
Alright, Zaku, have a good one.
Alright, later.
We wanted to give you a fair counterpoint here on the program.
All right, I know some of you guys are trying to get in, but we're way past the three hours of our lives that we set aside for this program.
So we're going to try and get back into it.
We want to do the cage match.
Maybe we'll open up Skype a little later because I saw some people calling in that weren't trying to call during the live show.
So I want to see if I can maybe get a couple of them.
Yeah, I got to make a song.
Yeah, when are you going to make your stinking song?
I was working on it.
I have a really bad thing with writer's block right now.
I've been trying to get past it.
I've been taking breaks from stuff and going back to it.
It's just not working.
So my thing is now is I'm going to make a song.
I don't care how crappy it is.
I'll submit it because I've got to do something so I can at least listen to the other songs so I can play them on show.
Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match
Three songs go into the cage match.
One from each co-host here on Orange Lounge Radio.
You guys vote for your favorite, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long here on Orange Lounge Radio's 24-7 Lamontian video game music program.
And let's start off with a clip of last week's winner.
It was my pick, because I'm special.
Okay, not really.
But you guys did vote for it.
It's Deep Dish with a song named after the town where Orange Lounge Radio broadcasts from.
West Coast, yo.
It's Deep Dish with Sacramento.
Song number one tonight's cage match.
My losing hand Don't understand
All right, that was song number one in our cage match, Deep Dish with Sacramento.
Let's get into song number two, which comes to us courtesy of Loki.
Loki, what'd you pick for us tonight?
I picked the song by, God, I don't remember who it's... Oh, by Quarter.
He's the guy that did some stuff on diverse systems, and I want to say he might even be working on stuff now.
There's a lot of those diverse system artists that crossed over to DJ Maxx and...
Ota Jam.
So he might be on one of the... on DJ Max, but I can't remember.
Anyways, this song's called Grand Parade, and I completely picked it out of random, so... Alright, we'll see if random picks are successful for Loki.
Here's song number two tonight.
Quarter with Grand Parade.
Enjoy.
Thank you for watching!
I give the fact that it finally ended a 10.
Other than that, I give it a 3.
It was very repetitive, very boring, very... Is it ever over yet?
Loki,
I give it a 5.
I actually stopped listening to it after a while.
I also give that song a 5 because that song reminds me of something from 2DX 5th style.
Like a very generic 2DX song spread out across about 25 minutes.
Xtofer, you want to rate that song?
I don't remember it.
So I give it a 0.
All right, kids, DarkSakura has a chance to redeem, I guess, a little bit here.
Wow, we all panned that one.
DarkSakura, what do you think of song three?
What's coming up?
This is a group, I believe they're from the Bay Area, called Babyland.
They are sort of a synth-industrial pop punk.
They do some of everything.
Like, their drum kit is like metal tubs and pipes.
They're really amazing.
The song is called Jerry, I think is how it's pronounced.
Yep.
And actually there's a video for this that's up on their website too, but they're just fantastic.
I'm going to see them in Berkeley on the 15th next month.
So it's an indie band.
Indie.
Oh yeah, I go indie as often as I can.
Alright, here it is, song number three, Babyland.
Jerry, enjoy.
Don't tell me I'm
All right, that was song number three in tonight's cage match.
Babyland with Jerry.
Let's go around and see what the folks thought of that.
DarkSakura.
Ten, and I'm going to see them next month.
That rocks.
Loki.
Eh, I don't know.
Seven.
Okay.
Extifer.
Extifer.
I haven't been paying attention.
No, no, no, it was good.
I liked it.
It was better than the last one.
Seven.
Oh, I like the music.
It kind of sounds like the Postal Service, but like, I don't know, like a little more hardcore, which is pretty cool.
The vocalist was a little screamy for me, though.
I don't like the screamy guys.
I don't know.
Not my thing.
But I like the music.
I thought musically it was good.
So I give the music a nine.
I give the singing a little less.
So I think I'll give it a seven and a half overall.
Alright, so let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight.
Here we go, starting off with song number one, Deep Dish with Sacramento.
And song number two you can vote for tonight is Quarter with Grand Parade.
Imagine that for about five minutes.
Song number three is Babyland with Jerry.
Sorry, Loki.
All right, guys.
Place vote now.
Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote, and we shall reveal the winner a little later in the program.
Well, damn, we're running really late tonight.
We've been on air for three and a half hours now.
Can you believe that?
I know.
It's like the old days when we did the podcast after.
I know, but we just had a lot to say tonight.
Pretty crazy, I guess.
We're some chatty, chatty people.
That's right.
Loki, what the hell are you doing online over there?
I see you doing something game-related.
I can't see what she's doing, but I can see what you're doing.
I'm just looking up the achievements for Ridge Racer 6.
They're hard.
I can't remember where they are.
You know most games give you one really easy achievement, like power on the game and kill one monster and you get five points.
Ridge Racer don't give you any of that.
You have to like 360 and you get five points.
I can't even... I thought I did a 360, but I guess that's just my car spinning around a lot because I hit a wall.
I finally broke the barrier in Ridge Racer.
I was able to beat the first race, finally.
And then, like, after beating the first race, I was able to clear, like, ten races.
Like, really easy.
So, I don't know.
I finally got over my Ridge Racer handicap, I guess.
What is that about Splinter Cell or Ghost Recon?
It says it only has 925 achievement points.
I thought it had 1,000.
No, every game has 1,000 except that one for some reason.
That has 925.
I don't know why.
You got robbed to 75 points somewhere.
Stupid.
So I have 1,340 out of 14,625 based on what I own.
And you have a perfect 1000 in full auto now, huh?
Yeah, I have the full autos finished.
50 out of 50 for that.
Good job.
But, like, there's games I bought, you know, now, at the time at launch, you know, I thought, oh, those are going to be really cool games, you know, like Perfect Dark Zero.
And I haven't played, I've played that twice.
I couldn't get into Perfect Dark Zero.
I understand where people are, like, totally loving this game.
I couldn't do it.
I liked the club...
I liked the club level in that game.
That really was the most fun level to me.
But I can't play it because I get motion sick.
I play mostly the arcade games.
Most of my achievements are little 200-pointer games.
Well, I have a lot of the arcade games.
Here's the ones I've got to play through.
I'm planning on selling some of this stuff back.
Full auto, I'm debating whether I want to sell it back because I do like the game, but I'm kind of done with it.
There really isn't...
Multiplayer-wise, it's only two-player and there's not really any good deathmatch type stuff for it.
So, I'm thinking I'm probably just going to sell that one back.
But the other games I want to blaster real quick, The Outfit, I need to go through that real quick because it's a cool game, but...
I don't know, I just haven't really played it online.
Call of Duty 2, I'm kind of getting tired of that game, so I need to finish the whole game on, I guess, Veteran, which should be freaking hard.
And Ghost Recon, eh, I just need to play that more.
It'll be, I think, a lot more fun.
I don't know, Need for Speed Most Wanted, that game looked kind of lame, so I just have to go through that.
And then I need the Barrier Cameo, because I started achieving points on that, and I sold mine back.
Yeah, you can borrow that.
I want to play Burnout, so we'll make a little trade or something.
Maybe Amp 3 or something.
Well, I'm on rank.
Wait, do you have Amp 3 with you?
I had Amp 3.
Damn you.
Why?
I need to play more games.
I sold it back, but I'm going to probably buy it again.
Okay.
Because it actually, for those who might not know that out there, it dropped in price to $39.99.
Oh, that's cool.
So if you can find it,
Thanks for watching!
Yeah, sure.
It's a cool game.
Something you're not playing a lot of.
It's a cool game.
I just haven't really gotten into it yet.
Okay.
That'd be cool.
Sweet.
Because I want to get some more achievement points, too.
I feel like achievement point whoring it up a little bit.
I swear to God, that shit is crack.
Is it?
It gets me to buy games I wouldn't normally buy.
See, that's Microsoft's got you by the balls.
Alright.
To be honest, I do buy games just for this show to talk about them.
You know what?
I find that to be my weakness too.
In fact, I was just commenting.
We were in Fry's the other day and I was just commenting to somebody that like, oh my god, I started buying a lot more games when we started doing this program.
It's bad.
Just to give me more to talk about on the program.
We need to get gaming companies to send them to us for free.
I think that should be our mission at E3 this year.
I'm selling them at work.
We're supposed to be getting them sent to us, but...
I'm sorry if I offended anybody tonight.
I just thought I would be a little bit gentleman-like and say that.
Extend my apologies.
Babyland Tower to the indie band
Alright, with the screaming guy.
Okay, a lot of their other stuff is a lot more industrial sounding, you know, so his screaming does fit.
But that one, I actually thought that you would like that one for the synth poppy.
I do, I like the music.
I love the music.
The guy's voice is a little wacky.
They have a MySpace up that's got more of their stuff on there.
I'll check it out.
Speaking of MySpace...
Speaking of Myspace, we're on Myspace.
Yes, we are.
We love Myspace.
Get this.
Echo Image has a Myspace.
The singer from Echo Image freaking commented on my Myspace.
That made me such a screaming little girl earlier this week.
I mean, seriously, that's so cool.
So check that.
Echo Image is on Myspace.
Zoic is on Myspace as well.
I'm trying to think of other DDR bands I saw on there.
I don't know.
But Orange Lounge Radio is on there too.
It's what?
Myspace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, I think.
And there's clips of our show.
And I'll probably put the Chocobo clip up from tonight because that was pretty funny.
We'll link the Myspace in our LiveJournal community.
I think we posted there before, but we need more people to join.
We only have 50 friends.
I know there's more than that listening to the show.
We're being total MySpace whores now, but we will not spam.
We might leave comments.
I have to say that 50 in the first couple of weeks of being up is not bad at all.
We might leave comments that says thank you.
We have to come up with some funny MySpace pictures, so maybe we'll work on that this week and leave you guys some comments.
But we will not send random messages to people saying, hey, you're a fan of such and such.
You should listen to Orange Lingerie.
No, I hate that shit.
I always report that stuff.
I always flag it for spam abuse.
We might comment on your MySpaces, though.
If you don't like us commenting on your MySpace, you can delete it.
We won't be offended.
But we're going to comment.
I think that's it.
I know we have chatroom FUs to do, too, but honestly, I kind of want to just wrap it up.
Yeah, I need to go.
Yeah, one more thing.
Sorry, chat room, but we know you're angsty too, but we'll just have to get that in another time.
So just yell them out real quick in the chat room.
Do an FU post on our LiveJournal community.
There you go.
All right, that's going to do it for now, though.
Oh, I need to check.
During the cage match, I actually ran out and took a picture of my Xbox with the Mario background.
I'm going to try and upload that to the forums if the picture finally posted here.
So look for that on our forums a little later.
I'm sleepy That's light!
I'm gonna go home and play Ragnar Crack online.
No, because I've eaten plenty of food today.
I had a piece of cheesecake for freakin' breakfast.
No, it was six-carp cheesecake from Cheesecake Factory.
That stuff is crack.
DarkSakura
My final thought is streaming media.
Loki, how am I going to fit in playing games, making music, have to work on a webpage, have to work on the other webpage, and life?
Well, thank you for that downer.
Extifer, your final thought.
Who is this superhero?
Sarge?
No.
Rosemary, the telephone operator?
No.
Henry, mild-mannered janitor?
Could be!

Alright kids, that does it for tonight.
We'll see you guys back here next week.
Have a great week and that's it.
We're going to go back to our video game music program so please reconnect to the stream in about 15 seconds.
Alright, have a good one.
