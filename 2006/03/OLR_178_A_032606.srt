00:00:14,184 --> 00:00:25,289
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, March 26th, 2006, we cover the highlights of the Game Developers Conference, World of Warcraft teaches us a lesson on business, and Congress gets 20,000 messages from video gamers.

2
00:00:32,492 --> 00:00:38,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:38,674 --> 00:00:39,314
[SPEAKER_01]: It is March 26, 2006.

4
00:00:40,014 --> 00:00:47,936
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode number 178 and thanks so much for tuning in live or downloading us, whatever the case may be.

5
00:00:48,456 --> 00:00:49,376
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Rob Roberts.

6
00:00:49,396 --> 00:00:50,396
[SPEAKER_01]: You might know me as Sky.

7
00:00:50,456 --> 00:00:54,037
[SPEAKER_01]: Joining me as always, say hello to the lovely DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:55,398 --> 00:00:56,618
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I think the mic is off, dear.

9
00:00:57,509 --> 00:00:58,129
[SPEAKER_03]: TechMasterLoki

10
00:01:24,864 --> 00:01:25,585
[SPEAKER_01]: GameDevelopersConference.com

11
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:57,674
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like we got to be in the same city and we were near people that were going to Game Developers Conference, although we didn't actually get to go ourselves.

12
00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:05,076
[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't get to go to no blogger's breakfast, so we had to make our own, you know, cool kids... Podcaster's dinner.

13
00:02:05,096 --> 00:02:07,497
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, cool kids dinner or something like that.

14
00:02:07,537 --> 00:02:07,857
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

15
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:09,677
[SPEAKER_03]: That place was pretty tasty.

16
00:02:10,177 --> 00:02:11,878
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a good place, wherever that was that we went.

17
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,979
[SPEAKER_01]: The little, like, it's not Benihana.

18
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:14,759
[SPEAKER_01]: Semi-Hana.

19
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:15,739
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Semi-Hana.

20
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:17,160
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Genji.

21
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,040
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a good place.

22
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

23
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,681
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, what kind of games have you been into?

24
00:02:44,088 --> 00:02:45,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I haven't been able to do a lot of gaming.

25
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:54,074
[SPEAKER_03]: I sprained my wrist last Friday, so I've been kind of not able to use the D-pad very well until a couple days ago.

26
00:02:54,194 --> 00:03:00,417
[SPEAKER_03]: We picked up Tetris DS, and I haven't actually got to play it yet because I can't get it away from Dan.

27
00:03:01,578 --> 00:03:03,179
[SPEAKER_01]: Which must mean it's pretty good.

28
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:06,301
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't played any Animal Crossing at all this week.

29
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,121
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations.

30
00:03:07,141 --> 00:03:10,223
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing lots of Ragnarok Online because I can use my mouse.

31
00:03:11,207 --> 00:03:18,591
[SPEAKER_03]: I am now level 52-38, Thief, and then I have like an Archer, and I have a Merchant that I've started too.

32
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:24,855
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dan also picked up the initial D game for PSP, which comes with a lanyard, it was pretty cool.

33
00:03:25,555 --> 00:03:28,697
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard lots of Eurobeat pouring out of the living room as I left the house today.

34
00:03:29,597 --> 00:03:34,800
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what the game, oh and he's been playing a lot of Burnout, which I'm like, whatever.

35
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,822
[SPEAKER_03]: That game does not interest me in the least.

36
00:03:39,003 --> 00:03:39,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?

37
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:40,689
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks stupid.

38
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,931
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about, what, the sixth racing game to come out for Xbox 360?

39
00:03:44,031 --> 00:03:46,933
[SPEAKER_03]: I get tired of there being nothing but racing games in my house.

40
00:03:47,934 --> 00:03:54,758
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it may be fun for people, but it looks like more of the same crap he's been playing for, like, the past three months, and I'm sick of it.

41
00:03:55,058 --> 00:04:08,706
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because they're most of the racing, well, actually, it's what, EA, Need for Speed Most Wanted, and Burnout look exactly the same, or pretty close at least, because, you know, they're both ports of the Xbox version, with

42
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:14,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Project Gotham, Full Auto, Ridge Racer, Need for Speed I bought me my Katamari

43
00:04:38,934 --> 00:04:39,975
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's pretty fun.

44
00:04:40,315 --> 00:04:42,716
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks really pretty on the PSP, that's for sure.

45
00:04:43,297 --> 00:04:44,437
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't control too well.

46
00:04:46,358 --> 00:04:53,943
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really like how they do the directional pad and the four buttons instead of two analogs, but what are you going to do with the PSP?

47
00:04:54,903 --> 00:05:01,607
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is very pretty, and if you do play it for a while, you do eventually get used to the controls, although they do make your hand hurt a bit.

48
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:30,787
[SPEAKER_02]: then of course I played a little bit of Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories as usual and also I've been playing on the 360 finally got all my achievements unlocked in full auto today and also I played a little bit of Oblivion and that game is just huge and it's very pretty but just really huge like today I was like you know I see a mountain over there

49
00:05:31,328 --> 00:05:32,648
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go walk that direction.

50
00:05:32,968 --> 00:05:35,109
[SPEAKER_02]: And sure enough, you can pretty much climb to the top of that mountain.

51
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:42,971
[SPEAKER_02]: And meanwhile, I was sneaking around through the dark and I see deer, so I throw fireballs and kill the deer because I can.

52
00:05:43,692 --> 00:05:52,334
[SPEAKER_02]: And other fun things like I pickpocketed a key from this one guy in town and went to his house, stole all this stuff and dumped it on the street because I can.

53
00:05:53,963 --> 00:05:55,304
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a jackass in the game.

54
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,861
[SPEAKER_01]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

55
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:57,615
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool, I'm not going to knock the game for having that, but I was a little bit taken aback, because I'm like, okay, I'm just starting this game, and already I feel really overwhelmed.

56
00:06:57,955 --> 00:07:00,897
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, Loki was showing it to me, and he's telling me everything to do.

57
00:07:00,977 --> 00:07:02,318
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, press this button, press this button.

58
00:07:02,558 --> 00:07:04,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, press this, then this, then this, and this, and this.

59
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:07,081
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh my gosh, this is overwhelming.

60
00:07:07,341 --> 00:07:11,504
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I thought about when I played Final Fantasy XI for the first time, I kind of felt the same way.

61
00:07:11,544 --> 00:07:13,365
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know it's just one of those games you have to get used to.

62
00:07:13,485 --> 00:07:15,546
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that hard once you get through it, no.

63
00:07:15,973 --> 00:07:24,615
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyways, of course, you know, there was a little leak out there about how there's a glitch with one character where you can kill him and, you know, get infinite gold.

64
00:07:25,135 --> 00:07:28,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I went and tried to kill this guy, and goddammit, he keeps raining away.

65
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:30,317
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't kill him fast enough.

66
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:33,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if I sneak up on him, I just, I can't do it.

67
00:07:34,077 --> 00:07:44,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is surprising, because you'd think if you hit somebody with a double-edged, you know, a two-handed sword really hard in the back when they weren't expecting it, you'd think, yeah, they're probably going to be on the ground, you know.

68
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:49,362
[SPEAKER_02]: But damn, I can whack away at this guy and he freaking puts up a fight and then runs away like a coward.

69
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:50,682
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, holy shit.

70
00:07:50,702 --> 00:07:52,763
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if I was getting hit with a sword, they would be down.

71
00:07:53,663 --> 00:07:53,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

72
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:56,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, but yeah, tons of stuff to do in this game.

73
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:59,205
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know.

74
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:00,846
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a long game.

75
00:08:01,046 --> 00:08:02,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very long.

76
00:08:03,707 --> 00:08:06,748
[SPEAKER_02]: I played the, what was it, Blazing Angels demo.

77
00:08:06,968 --> 00:08:07,508
[SPEAKER_02]: That was fun.

78
00:08:08,068 --> 00:08:10,969
[SPEAKER_02]: I especially loved taking off and then turning back around and

79
00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:13,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Shooting the people that were on the ground in my headquarters.

80
00:08:13,841 --> 00:08:14,342
[SPEAKER_02]: That was fun.

81
00:08:15,403 --> 00:08:16,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't like it too much.

82
00:08:16,283 --> 00:08:19,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Kept crashing in the buildings, though, because I suck at Flight Sims.

83
00:08:20,427 --> 00:08:22,949
[SPEAKER_02]: And... God, what else did I play?

84
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:27,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Some more... What was it?

85
00:08:29,015 --> 00:08:29,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Geometry Wars.

86
00:08:30,837 --> 00:08:31,437
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of cool.

87
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:33,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.

88
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:42,647
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if Oblivion had came out when it was first originally supposed to be out, like not quite as a launch title, but what, like end of December was the original time frame for the game, right?

89
00:08:43,348 --> 00:08:54,439
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I would have had a chance to play it, but now it's kind of like, okay, in my imaginary game queue in my head of the games I want to play and in the order I want to play them, unfortunately Oblivion's kind of like...

90
00:08:55,165 --> 00:08:55,785
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

91
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:23,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, I mean, to make the game better, I mean, fine, but, you know, it's just too bad that it didn't happen when it was originally supposed to, because I probably would have wanted to play it more, but honestly, there's only so many hours in a day, so...

92
00:09:35,785 --> 00:09:37,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine running for, like, hours and hours.

93
00:09:37,986 --> 00:09:38,707
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not fun.

94
00:09:38,807 --> 00:09:42,269
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can do, like, quick travel and stuff, which is pretty cool.

95
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:48,892
[SPEAKER_02]: I did get stuck behind a rock one time in a cave because, hey, I'm going to go back there.

96
00:09:48,972 --> 00:09:54,155
[SPEAKER_02]: And the problem is, if you don't land on the ground, it won't let you jump again.

97
00:09:54,495 --> 00:09:55,596
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got stuck.

98
00:09:55,636 --> 00:10:01,039
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't quite, you know, I was kind of clipped on the rock, and I couldn't quite touch the ground, so it wouldn't let me jump.

99
00:10:01,119 --> 00:10:03,600
[SPEAKER_02]: So I could not move, which was bad.

100
00:10:04,161 --> 00:10:05,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

101
00:10:32,394 --> 00:10:33,516
[SPEAKER_01]: It probably would let you.

102
00:10:33,577 --> 00:10:34,378
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very thorough.

103
00:10:35,361 --> 00:10:37,205
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, any other games you've been playing this week?

104
00:10:38,228 --> 00:10:38,448
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

105
00:10:38,469 --> 00:10:39,030
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

106
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,701
[SPEAKER_01]: My Gaming Week.

107
00:10:40,721 --> 00:10:49,530
[SPEAKER_01]: I spend a little time customizing my Xbox 360 because you can link it up to your PC to play music off your PC and look at pictures from your PC.

108
00:10:49,830 --> 00:11:02,943
[SPEAKER_01]: So I finally played with this feature a little bit this week because for some wacky reason I thought that you could also stream movies from your PC, but I guess you have to have Media Center to do that, which I don't, but I went to the hassle to set it up anyway only to be disappointed.

109
00:11:03,383 --> 00:11:09,565
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's still kind of neat that you can use music from your computers, custom soundtracks to games and stuff, and use the pictures.

110
00:11:09,825 --> 00:11:17,647
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one other thing that you can do with the pictures is that you can actually change the theme on your Xbox 360 to be one of the pictures from that.

111
00:11:18,028 --> 00:11:19,108
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can set your own...

112
00:11:19,808 --> 00:11:21,389
[SPEAKER_01]: background, essentially by doing that.

113
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:30,931
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought to be ironic, what I did is I went onto Nintendo's website and I downloaded a background for Mario Kart DS and I put that background in the share folder.

114
00:11:31,252 --> 00:11:36,693
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now when I bring up my Xbox 360, it's got this big Nintendo Mario Kart DS background.

115
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:40,654
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll have to take a picture of it and put it on the forums just to be cute.

116
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:41,515
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why I did it.

117
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:42,755
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it would be funny.

118
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:46,831
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess there's only some things only I find amusing.

119
00:11:46,871 --> 00:11:47,151
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

120
00:11:47,191 --> 00:11:48,392
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe some of you out there find that amusing.

121
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:49,593
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

122
00:11:49,954 --> 00:11:55,238
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as actual games I was playing, speaking of Xbox, I downloaded Astro Pop in the Xbox Live Arcade.

123
00:11:56,619 --> 00:12:07,508
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a little bit over the love affair with PopCap-style games, and Astro Pop was a game I really liked an awful lot back when it was called Magical Drop.

124
00:12:08,088 --> 00:12:08,289
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

125
00:12:09,202 --> 00:12:16,425
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Astro Pop a little bit on the PC, but when I played on the Xbox 360, the thrill was kind of gone after a couple rounds.

126
00:12:17,165 --> 00:12:18,886
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't really a long-lasting game for me.

127
00:12:18,926 --> 00:12:24,328
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like the fact they're charging $10 for these games when gems like Geometry Wars are only $5.

128
00:12:24,508 --> 00:12:34,032
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I can really recommend Astro Pop unless you're really, really into the puzzle games, in which case you've probably already downloaded this and you know this game's for you.

129
00:12:35,436 --> 00:12:38,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of puzzlers, here's a game now that's worth every penny.

130
00:12:38,137 --> 00:12:40,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Tetris DS just came out for the Nintendo DS this week.

131
00:12:41,137 --> 00:12:41,957
[SPEAKER_01]: It is awesome.

132
00:12:42,797 --> 00:12:51,639
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the thing with Tetris is that we know there's been a crapload of Tetris games since Tetris on the Game Boy.

133
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:56,600
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, I know there was a really big one on the PlayStation, but none of the Tetris games have been very memorable.

134
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:01,201
[SPEAKER_01]: And nothing's really matched that bar that Game Boy Tetris set.

135
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,981
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll leave it to Nintendo to come back and do it again and

136
00:13:04,281 --> 00:13:13,625
[SPEAKER_01]: and make their game memorable, which they've done, I think, by inserting all these cute 8-bit retro things and, you know, with the music and all that, all these new modes.

137
00:13:13,645 --> 00:13:15,365
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just huge amounts of new modes.

138
00:13:15,906 --> 00:13:18,667
[SPEAKER_01]: The catch mode and the touch mode and the puzzle mode.

139
00:13:18,967 --> 00:13:20,567
[SPEAKER_01]: Just all this stuff to keep you busy.

140
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:22,628
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, you can take it online.

141
00:13:22,908 --> 00:13:27,750
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the great thing about being able to play it online is that, you know, it's a real quick game that you can play online.

142
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:32,632
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of wish that you could play online in an unranked setting

143
00:13:33,032 --> 00:13:35,614
[SPEAKER_01]: The only way you could do that is by playing people on your friends list.

144
00:13:35,954 --> 00:13:39,277
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the reverse side, you can't play ranked matches against your friends.

145
00:13:39,677 --> 00:13:43,360
[SPEAKER_01]: So either you play against strangers in a ranked match or friends in an unranked match.

146
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,301
[SPEAKER_01]: There's really no in between.

147
00:13:45,361 --> 00:13:47,003
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's probably only my minor gripe.

148
00:13:48,504 --> 00:13:50,125
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, this game is magnificent.

149
00:13:50,185 --> 00:13:52,847
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're a puzzle fan, you must have this game.

150
00:13:52,887 --> 00:13:54,028
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a must-own game.

151
00:13:54,688 --> 00:13:55,249
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not...

152
00:13:56,224 --> 00:13:56,764
[SPEAKER_01]: Puzzle Fan

153
00:14:25,194 --> 00:14:26,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Other games I've been playing this week.

154
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:33,441
[SPEAKER_01]: I also picked up Metroid Prime Hunters, which is the 3D Metroid game which had the demo that was packed in with the DS initially.

155
00:14:33,722 --> 00:14:36,344
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the game's gotten a little bit of a facelift since the demo.

156
00:14:36,364 --> 00:14:38,086
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously it's been over a year now.

157
00:14:38,686 --> 00:14:40,087
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been playing the game.

158
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,089
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a very interesting control scheme.

159
00:14:42,109 --> 00:14:44,171
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pick from different control styles.

160
00:14:44,211 --> 00:14:48,375
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to use the stylus, but using the stylus kind of makes the most sense.

161
00:14:48,875 --> 00:15:16,123
[SPEAKER_01]: but what I kind of find is that you really have to find the right position for yourself to play this game or you can really hurt your arm like it really can make your arm sore to play this game I kind of found and I did not like the fact I seem to recall in the demo that the map was always on the bottom screen like you kind of got a 2D representation that's gone like you can pause the game to get a 3D map a la Descent type thing but it sucks I don't like the map at all I don't know what happened and that

162
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:22,296
[SPEAKER_01]: That really wrecked it for me in some ways because the 3D games are kind of weird enough for me.

163
00:15:22,556 --> 00:15:26,181
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a very map-oriented person, so I was a little unhappy with that.

164
00:15:26,221 --> 00:15:28,644
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't very clear also how to save your game.

165
00:15:29,024 --> 00:15:33,330
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the how to get into the game and stuff wasn't very clear to me.

166
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:37,693
[SPEAKER_01]: If you like the Metroid games on GameCube, I don't see why you wouldn't like this.

167
00:15:38,373 --> 00:15:41,255
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't tried the online mode yet, but I'm sure it's a lot of fun.

168
00:15:42,436 --> 00:15:45,998
[SPEAKER_01]: But honestly, I don't think it's really worth all the hype.

169
00:15:46,098 --> 00:15:51,421
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think Metroid Prime Hunters is quite the game it really could have been for me.

170
00:15:51,601 --> 00:15:52,002
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

171
00:15:52,542 --> 00:15:56,104
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'm just being a little harsh because there were just a couple things that really bugged me about it.

172
00:15:56,144 --> 00:16:01,828
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really, I can only recommend this title to you if you like the other action style games.

173
00:16:02,216 --> 00:16:02,997
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching.

174
00:16:03,017 --> 00:16:04,600
[SPEAKER_01]: See you next time.

175
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,301
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it for our gaming weeks.

176
00:16:19,841 --> 00:16:20,862
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on to some news.

177
00:16:21,282 --> 00:16:28,927
[SPEAKER_01]: And, of course, the big, big news this week was Game Developers Conference, which happened over this past week, which we almost went to.

178
00:16:29,227 --> 00:16:32,009
[SPEAKER_01]: We were standing kind of next door to it, but we didn't really go.

179
00:16:32,049 --> 00:16:33,870
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to read about it on the Internet, just like you guys.

180
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,751
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's a quick summary of what happened.

181
00:16:35,792 --> 00:16:38,974
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Loki, you're going to go down kind of company by company here, and we'll talk about it a little bit.

182
00:16:39,394 --> 00:16:39,594
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

183
00:16:39,654 --> 00:16:40,014
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

184
00:16:40,214 --> 00:16:41,095
[SPEAKER_01]: What's Tony talking about?

185
00:16:41,624 --> 00:16:48,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, Sony, of course, their big thing was talking about the PlayStation 3 and the PSP and all that fun stuff.

186
00:16:48,909 --> 00:17:01,618
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, really, they were just kind of talking about, you know, what they're going to do as far... Well, one of the games they announced was God of War 2, which they showed the demo for it, and it looked awesome, of course.

187
00:17:01,638 --> 00:17:07,542
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, God of War just was one of the best games before the PlayStation 2, so it makes sense that they're going to make the second one.

188
00:17:08,466 --> 00:17:22,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, of course, they talked a little bit about the PSP and what changes are going to come to it, including both the GPS, which is coming out later this year, and also the iToy, which is going to be coming out later this year for it as well.

189
00:17:23,914 --> 00:17:30,017
[SPEAKER_02]: New web browser, of course, with improved RSS channel and Macromedia Flash, which is going to be great.

190
00:17:30,477 --> 00:17:32,138
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually coming in the next update.

191
00:17:33,158 --> 00:17:36,640
[SPEAKER_02]: And then with the video camera, they're actually going to have a Wi-Fi connection

192
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:39,740
[SPEAKER_02]: VideoPhone option for it as well.

193
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:45,321
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know, not quite side-talking, but pretty close.

194
00:17:47,381 --> 00:17:48,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting nonetheless.

195
00:17:49,042 --> 00:17:54,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing they announced, though, was that LocoRoco is coming to the PSP.

196
00:17:54,783 --> 00:18:01,745
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of like another game almost similar to the Katamari, since it's a very awkward, strange Japanese game that they're bringing over here.

197
00:18:01,765 --> 00:18:01,805
[SPEAKER_02]: So,

198
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:08,172
[SPEAKER_01]: What makes this thing as Katamari is leaving and quitting while they're ahead, so to speak.

199
00:18:08,592 --> 00:18:12,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to try and find something to fill that gap in the quirky game category.

200
00:18:12,735 --> 00:18:13,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

201
00:18:14,237 --> 00:18:16,819
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing is, of course, they were showing tech demos for the PS3.

202
00:18:17,659 --> 00:18:21,902
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, they had the classic ducks in there and made a big joke about that.

203
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:24,244
[SPEAKER_02]: But it looked pretty cool.

204
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:30,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the other demos I was actually pretty interested in, they had one showing a vehicle physics demo.

205
00:18:31,454 --> 00:18:47,122
[SPEAKER_02]: and basically showed this really cool looking car get basically destroyed by a bunch of bullets and all done incredibly accurate to, you know, just physics-wise, you know, paint chipping and it's just amazing.

206
00:18:47,702 --> 00:18:58,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, another game they showed, of course, Warhawk, which is one of the ones, kind of, I think that was actually an old PlayStation game, if I remember correctly, kind of an aerial combat game, almost like Twisted Metal, but for air.

207
00:18:58,988 --> 00:19:00,029
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

208
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:25,834
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course they also announced that they're going to have full PlayStation 2 support for the PS3.

209
00:19:26,135 --> 00:19:31,859
[SPEAKER_02]: And all the games are going to be upscaled to the 1080p or whatever.

210
00:19:33,137 --> 00:19:33,457
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

211
00:19:33,998 --> 00:19:35,499
[SPEAKER_01]: You know more about tech than I do.

212
00:19:35,719 --> 00:19:43,183
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is it, and maybe some of our listeners too, why is it that it seems like Microsoft is having such a problem with backwards compatibility?

213
00:19:43,243 --> 00:19:45,364
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, only some things can be played.

214
00:19:45,444 --> 00:19:47,745
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas PlayStation can do it easily.

215
00:19:48,245 --> 00:19:50,066
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, isn't it the graphics thing?

216
00:19:50,226 --> 00:19:58,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, because it has to emulate the other graphics chip, whereas this is the same graphics chip or same family of graphics chips.

217
00:19:58,111 --> 00:20:00,392
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why they can run it perfectly.

218
00:20:01,331 --> 00:20:05,334
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a bummer because I think that's a pretty big selling point for Sony.

219
00:20:05,374 --> 00:20:06,255
[SPEAKER_01]: That's too bad for Microsoft.

220
00:20:15,745 --> 00:20:16,586
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

221
00:20:38,922 --> 00:20:41,383
[SPEAKER_02]: and, of course, just, you know, micropayments and stuff.

222
00:20:41,803 --> 00:20:44,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, if it's on Xbox Live, you're going to probably see it on there.

223
00:20:44,265 --> 00:20:53,089
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the advantages to launching your console a year after one of your biggest competitors is that you can basically copy everything that they did, and that sounds like what they're doing with their setup.

224
00:20:53,529 --> 00:21:07,916
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing that they were doing with it a little bit differently, one, they're not going to be a central server for the games, but all the other companies are going to be running their external servers, but this one you'll log into and it'll be kind of like an...

225
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:09,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

226
00:21:31,953 --> 00:21:32,694
[SPEAKER_01]: Purchasing games?

227
00:21:33,054 --> 00:21:33,534
[SPEAKER_01]: Possibility?

228
00:22:02,256 --> 00:22:03,157
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on.

229
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:25,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

230
00:22:42,831 --> 00:22:52,314
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, and I honestly don't remember a lot about the launches of PlayStation 2 and PlayStation because I was more following that stuff casually because we weren't doing this back then.

231
00:22:52,834 --> 00:23:02,396
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I noticed that when consoles first come out, the games are never as graphically powerful as they can be towards the end of the console's run.

232
00:23:02,697 --> 00:23:06,198
[SPEAKER_01]: So to say the games look better than Xbox 360, well, for now, right?

233
00:23:06,258 --> 00:23:11,279
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, couldn't Xbox 360 come out with a more graphically enhanced game later in its life?

234
00:23:11,755 --> 00:23:15,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I don't know if it has the processing power, I think.

235
00:23:16,038 --> 00:23:17,539
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

236
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:27,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, the last thing they kind of touched on, which is interesting, is SingStar, which, for those who might not know, it's actually a karaoke game that's really popular in the UK.

237
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:29,167
[SPEAKER_02]: They're bringing it over here.

238
00:23:29,227 --> 00:23:35,171
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be on NextGen, which I don't know how you can really improve a singing game that much, but it should be interesting.

239
00:23:35,711 --> 00:23:38,353
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of surprised with Karaoke Revolution's success.

240
00:23:38,413 --> 00:23:39,374
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of odd that

241
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,470
[SPEAKER_01]: God of War 2 PlayStation 2

242
00:24:05,325 --> 00:24:10,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well, it sounds like Sony's got a lot on their plate there, so very cool.

243
00:24:10,455 --> 00:24:11,277
[SPEAKER_01]: What about Nintendo?

244
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:16,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo definitely... We were all hoping they would be talking about the revolution, and...

245
00:24:17,219 --> 00:24:17,860
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

246
00:24:36,345 --> 00:24:36,525
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on.

247
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:06,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Zelda The Phantom Hourglass

248
00:25:35,709 --> 00:25:51,475
[SPEAKER_02]: and of course we'd be using the touchscreen for a bunch of different puzzles as well as kind of like, I don't know if you remember the old Batman Returns movie or whatever, but where Batman actually programmed into his bat-ring where it would fly.

249
00:25:51,535 --> 00:25:53,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's kind of a similar thing with the boomerang.

250
00:25:53,376 --> 00:25:56,938
[SPEAKER_02]: You draw a path for the boomerang and it will fly with that.

251
00:25:57,658 --> 00:26:00,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Just really cool, kind of combining the look of

252
00:26:02,347 --> 00:26:06,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Zelda, Wind Waker, and some of the Minish Cap stuff.

253
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:12,082
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't think I should really be surprised.

254
00:26:12,602 --> 00:26:14,363
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed a lot of people were really surprised.

255
00:26:14,383 --> 00:26:16,224
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, OMG, a Zelda game on the DS.

256
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:19,265
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, it kind of seems pretty logical, doesn't it?

257
00:26:20,386 --> 00:26:26,508
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, my reaction to that when I read the news was like, Oh yeah, it is about time for a Zelda game on the DS.

258
00:26:26,548 --> 00:26:27,709
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't really had one yet.

259
00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:29,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, that was kind of my reaction to the news.

260
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,411
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh yeah, I wonder when they are going to be doing that.

261
00:26:32,471 --> 00:26:35,032
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was kind of cool to see, though, and see...

262
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,382
[SPEAKER_01]: That they're going to go with the Wind Waker style look for the DS game.

263
00:26:39,502 --> 00:26:40,663
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of should be interesting.

264
00:26:40,883 --> 00:26:42,324
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not think that is cool at all.

265
00:26:42,784 --> 00:26:43,025
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?

266
00:26:43,065 --> 00:26:44,526
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because you don't like the Wind Waker look?

267
00:26:44,886 --> 00:26:51,491
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't like... I thought that it was... I never did like that type of art style.

268
00:26:51,872 --> 00:26:54,093
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that it looked very poorly done.

269
00:26:54,914 --> 00:26:58,497
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't think... It was like trying to be stylistic, but it looked really...

270
00:26:59,443 --> 00:27:01,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like a five-year-old drew it.

271
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:05,846
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's the kind of look that should have been on the DS and only on the DS.

272
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:09,507
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of should have been the portable look and not the GameCube one.

273
00:27:09,547 --> 00:27:11,088
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it shouldn't have been a look at all.

274
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:13,989
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I have to agree to disagree on that one.

275
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:16,550
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else interesting?

276
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:25,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, some of the other things, they were talking about creating a video game version of Apple's iTunes, but for video games, kind of like a service for that.

277
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:27,166
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

278
00:27:48,764 --> 00:27:55,566
[SPEAKER_01]: I think only kind of further proves this theory that you're going to have to pay for this because I don't see them signing these agreements to make it all free.

279
00:27:55,986 --> 00:27:57,886
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think you are going to see something very similar.

280
00:27:57,906 --> 00:28:07,188
[SPEAKER_01]: The iTunes store where you pay like a dollar to play the game, maybe a dollar fifty to maybe even up to five dollars for some of the titles when we start getting into later generations.

281
00:28:07,828 --> 00:28:08,168
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?

282
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,209
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, that's all estimates.

283
00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:09,809
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, who knows?

284
00:28:11,846 --> 00:28:13,587
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you get a couple of them for free.

285
00:28:13,828 --> 00:28:15,569
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just to kind of show how it works.

286
00:28:15,949 --> 00:28:19,652
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, iTunes does a free song once in a while, so maybe they would do something like that.

287
00:28:19,712 --> 00:28:23,455
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I think for most of it, you're going to have to pay for the good stuff.

288
00:28:23,916 --> 00:28:25,797
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, to some people, it's going to be worth it.

289
00:28:26,057 --> 00:28:28,319
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a way of legalizing the ROM thing.

290
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:35,264
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I'm sure the industry's been wanting forever to kind of squelch the ROM scene that goes on underground on the Internet.

291
00:28:35,284 --> 00:28:38,047
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe this is their way to do it and kind of...

292
00:28:39,971 --> 00:28:45,814
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, sort of show that there is a legal outlet for this, and if they wanted to maybe take legal action against ROM stuff, I don't know.

293
00:28:46,194 --> 00:28:47,054
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm theorizing here.

294
00:28:50,215 --> 00:28:50,535
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

295
00:28:52,336 --> 00:29:02,760
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing I was interested in is, of course, everyone's thinking, okay, they're going to drop the bomb on some big The Revolution being VR type thing.

296
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,241
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been the rumor.

297
00:29:04,281 --> 00:29:05,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's thinking that.

298
00:29:06,042 --> 00:29:06,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, that didn't happen.

299
00:29:07,742 --> 00:29:10,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's because they're waiting for E3.

300
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:18,504
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, I've got, you know, this is going to be, there's still another major announcement.

301
00:29:18,684 --> 00:29:22,605
[SPEAKER_01]: You're still convinced on the stereoscopic 3D thing, aren't you?

302
00:29:23,305 --> 00:29:24,265
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still convinced.

303
00:29:26,426 --> 00:29:27,226
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's out there.

304
00:29:27,446 --> 00:29:31,567
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was actually a thing on, was it Holo Projection?

305
00:29:31,607 --> 00:29:33,547
[SPEAKER_02]: There was another device that they were showing.

306
00:29:35,165 --> 00:29:36,165
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember where I read that on.

307
00:29:36,846 --> 00:29:40,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Not necessarily for Nintendo, but for something else.

308
00:29:40,727 --> 00:29:42,648
[SPEAKER_02]: I know technology is out there.

309
00:29:43,188 --> 00:29:44,249
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's going to happen.

310
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:47,910
[SPEAKER_02]: You knew they weren't going to say anything at GDC.

311
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:48,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing.

312
00:29:48,751 --> 00:29:51,912
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole theme of it is disrupting gaming.

313
00:29:52,052 --> 00:29:54,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Disruptive gaming is what it is called.

314
00:29:54,193 --> 00:29:59,715
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically a technique where you make a big splash in the water.

315
00:29:59,735 --> 00:30:01,116
[SPEAKER_02]: That's basically the way it works.

316
00:30:01,696 --> 00:30:01,816
[SPEAKER_02]: And

317
00:30:02,737 --> 00:30:08,088
[SPEAKER_02]: What's gonna happen at E3, you're gonna get a lot of information that you haven't heard yet, and it's just gonna be like,

318
00:30:08,726 --> 00:30:22,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, it's kind of like, you know, just finishing off somebody, you know, real quick, you know, the one-two punch and then... Well, the companies are doing that so that they can't steal from each other, essentially, so that Nintendo, when they announce this at E3, it'll be too late for Sony to copy it in time for their launch.

319
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:26,561
[SPEAKER_01]: And same thing with whatever bomb Sony ends up dropping, same thing for Nintendo and Microsoft.

320
00:30:26,821 --> 00:30:32,826
[SPEAKER_01]: That puts Microsoft in kind of a funky position, not, I mean, but they could have secrets too that they're going to unveil at E3, you know, so...

321
00:30:33,446 --> 00:30:36,408
[SPEAKER_01]: But at E3, you've got the world media there.

322
00:30:36,468 --> 00:30:43,053
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, GDC, while it's important, doesn't quite have that same attention factor that E3 does.

323
00:30:43,194 --> 00:30:44,274
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?

324
00:30:44,915 --> 00:30:47,977
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, media people from around the world go to E3.

325
00:30:48,157 --> 00:30:49,078
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody is watching.

326
00:30:49,398 --> 00:30:51,920
[SPEAKER_01]: GDC, the hardcore gamers are watching.

327
00:30:53,521 --> 00:30:56,744
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I'm still confident because we haven't heard no yet.

328
00:30:57,865 --> 00:30:58,065
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

329
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:02,162
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm confident that, you know, there's got to be more to it.

330
00:31:02,282 --> 00:31:04,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we haven't seen really any of the demos yet.

331
00:31:06,104 --> 00:31:06,424
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

332
00:31:06,444 --> 00:31:08,185
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's going to happen.

333
00:31:08,205 --> 00:31:09,506
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll say six weeks until you find out.

334
00:31:09,606 --> 00:31:09,986
[SPEAKER_01]: Six weeks.

335
00:31:10,346 --> 00:31:14,289
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, of course, the big theme, which everybody, you know, you've got to love.

336
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:21,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Iwata's theme is basically, video games are meant to be just one thing.

337
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:21,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Fun.

338
00:31:22,473 --> 00:31:23,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Fun for everybody.

339
00:31:24,374 --> 00:31:25,375
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's hope he means it.

340
00:31:25,822 --> 00:31:30,263
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, based on Nintendo's track record, they're pretty good about keeping it with the funds.

341
00:31:31,064 --> 00:31:32,084
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving on, Microsoft.

342
00:31:32,144 --> 00:31:37,366
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Microsoft's in the position where they already have a system out there, so what kind of stuff were they pushing at GDC?

343
00:31:37,946 --> 00:31:43,087
[SPEAKER_02]: They were talking, of course, about, you know, Xbox Live Arcade and, like, kind of the stuff that's coming out for that.

344
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:54,571
[SPEAKER_02]: And just basically, you know, concentrating on Xbox Live, they released basically a framework for anybody to be able to kind of build a back-end to...

345
00:31:58,435 --> 00:32:24,894
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing that they were talking about Some of the downloads coming out for some of the Microsoft first party games Like Project Gotham, you're going to see more cars, more tracks Cameo, you're going to see co-op play over live As well as more outfits Actually they were already talking about Perfect Dark Which is going to have more multiplayer maps in Oblivion

346
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:54,724
[SPEAKER_02]: which I thought was interesting and the first pack is going to be a horse armor pack ok interesting yeah and also of course talking about the games coming out you know Street Fighter 2 was it Hoop World I think is one of the big ones coming out and there is going to be one of the first games using the Unreal 3 engines actually going to be hitting Xbox Live which I thought was interesting very cool oh and the webcam of course oh right

347
00:32:55,362 --> 00:32:59,846
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things, of course, we've kind of talked about the webcam a little bit before.

348
00:33:01,467 --> 00:33:04,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you know, something that looks kind of like a webcam or eye toy.

349
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:11,675
[SPEAKER_02]: What's interesting, though, is it's going to have gesture recognition.

350
00:33:12,236 --> 00:33:18,381
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess the camera is going to... So like if I stick up my middle finger at the game, it'll know, and it'll go, that's not nice.

351
00:33:18,781 --> 00:33:23,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm not sure exactly what that is, but... Gesture recognition.

352
00:33:23,485 --> 00:33:24,365
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess, you know...

353
00:33:25,874 --> 00:33:28,375
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're frowning or something, I don't know.

354
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:32,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe if that way... If I moon the camera while my Xbox go, Oh, God!

355
00:33:33,337 --> 00:33:40,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe if they eventually port over World of Warcraft to the 360, you'll see if you look suicidal so they can call the authorities.

356
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,560
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait a minute, though.

357
00:33:41,701 --> 00:33:44,962
[SPEAKER_01]: They said not going to happen on World of Warcraft on Xbox 360.

358
00:33:45,002 --> 00:33:45,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and here's why.

359
00:33:45,942 --> 00:33:49,324
[SPEAKER_02]: But see, Blizzard said it's not going to happen based on the framework that they have right now.

360
00:33:49,404 --> 00:33:52,045
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't make it easy for them to do it.

361
00:33:52,305 --> 00:33:54,906
[SPEAKER_02]: But now that they've done this and kind of changed, you know,

362
00:33:55,822 --> 00:33:58,983
[SPEAKER_02]: The way live works, it could happen.

363
00:33:59,783 --> 00:34:00,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it might happen.

364
00:34:01,003 --> 00:34:03,724
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't care, but yeah.

365
00:34:03,984 --> 00:34:05,544
[SPEAKER_01]: Comment from the chatroom, Rainy, again.

366
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:07,524
[SPEAKER_01]: Sky, what if you're aroused?

367
00:34:08,545 --> 00:34:10,665
[SPEAKER_01]: Would it sense that and then call somebody to come over?

368
00:34:11,165 --> 00:34:12,025
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm just teasing.

369
00:34:14,146 --> 00:34:14,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Special help.

370
00:34:17,426 --> 00:34:19,727
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the emo sensor comment.

371
00:34:21,714 --> 00:34:49,917
[SPEAKER_02]: what I do like about it though is it will be able to take high def still pictures which is pretty cool so 1280 by 980 1.3 megapixels would we be able to take a webcam like that put it in here and like broadcast over Xbox Live in a way yes now that might be kind of trippy I'll check that out it says smooth near DV quality video up to VGA 640 by 480 at 30 frames per second so in a sense we could probably do that

372
00:34:51,001 --> 00:34:51,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Which would be interesting.

373
00:34:53,483 --> 00:34:55,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Then digital zoom cropping.

374
00:34:56,005 --> 00:34:58,967
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also going to have a 9-foot USB cable, which is awesome.

375
00:34:59,607 --> 00:35:02,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I hate having to strap more USB cables to it.

376
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:04,390
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, sounds very cool.

377
00:35:05,031 --> 00:35:07,252
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of good stuff there coming out of Game Developers Conference.

378
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:09,134
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots more in six weeks at E3.

379
00:35:09,434 --> 00:35:14,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I think I said this last week on the show, GDC is kind of like that tease.

380
00:35:14,998 --> 00:35:15,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a little taste.

381
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:17,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a little bit of crack.

382
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,541
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll give you some more when you come back in six weeks for E3.

383
00:35:19,561 --> 00:35:19,601
[SPEAKER_01]: So,

384
00:35:21,357 --> 00:35:23,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let's move on and get into some other news.

385
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:28,643
[SPEAKER_01]: There was lots of other news that happened at GDC and kind of around GDC, so let's get into some of that.

386
00:35:29,243 --> 00:35:33,006
[SPEAKER_01]: Last week I was talking about Final Fantasy XI and there's a lot of expansions coming to that.

387
00:35:33,267 --> 00:35:38,491
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, I didn't even mention during my gaming week, I'm at level 12 on my new character on Final Fantasy XI.

388
00:35:39,071 --> 00:35:39,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Addict.

389
00:35:39,352 --> 00:35:39,672
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

390
00:35:40,307 --> 00:35:40,828
[SPEAKER_01]: I was waiting for that.

391
00:35:40,948 --> 00:35:41,989
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let's see.

392
00:35:42,069 --> 00:35:46,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Square Enix revealed a little bit of its new Chocobo circuit feature.

393
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:54,324
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically the way that you raise your bird in the game will determine its size and its shape and ultimately the stats.

394
00:35:54,705 --> 00:35:58,229
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's awesome because I want to have a fat Chocobo because fat Chocobo is the best.

395
00:35:58,369 --> 00:35:58,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it was.

396
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,581
[SPEAKER_01]: Smells like chocobo, remember?

397
00:36:02,061 --> 00:36:03,321
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so I want a fat chocobo.

398
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:13,444
[SPEAKER_01]: By introducing your chocobo to somebody else's bird, if they're compatible and of the opposite sex, you might be able to breed more chocobos.

399
00:36:13,744 --> 00:36:15,225
[SPEAKER_01]: No gay chocobo love in here.

400
00:36:15,345 --> 00:36:25,868
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, you know, I think the fallback for that is that, you know, you can't make babies in a homosexual relationship, not without test tubes and things that don't exist in the Final Fantasy world.

401
00:36:26,308 --> 00:36:27,609
[SPEAKER_01]: And donors, yeah.

402
00:36:27,709 --> 00:36:27,989
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

403
00:36:29,939 --> 00:36:31,980
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still things that are not answered yet.

404
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are you going to keep the chocobo?

405
00:36:34,441 --> 00:36:35,801
[SPEAKER_01]: Will it be in the mog house maybe?

406
00:36:36,781 --> 00:36:38,482
[SPEAKER_01]: How often can you do the breeding?

407
00:36:38,562 --> 00:36:40,022
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you sell the chocobos?

408
00:36:40,342 --> 00:36:41,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you trade them?

409
00:36:41,643 --> 00:36:45,004
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to be able to ride your own chocobo around the world?

410
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:46,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you eat them?

411
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:48,045
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you spank them when they're naughty?

412
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:51,279
[SPEAKER_03]: My chocobo was an old tea bunny.

413
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you cook them and eat them?

414
00:36:53,421 --> 00:36:53,741
[SPEAKER_01]: How rude.

415
00:36:53,761 --> 00:36:54,622
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be awesome.

416
00:36:54,782 --> 00:36:56,783
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't have Kentucky Fried Chocobo.

417
00:36:58,304 --> 00:36:59,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Can the chocobos attack the bunnies?

418
00:37:00,326 --> 00:37:08,411
[SPEAKER_01]: Once and for all, let's get rid of all those damn bunnies, like the uber bunnies in Buribumu or whatever that land is where the level 70 bunnies are.

419
00:37:08,431 --> 00:37:11,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have to take your chocobo for a walk and do you have to clean up after it?

420
00:37:11,694 --> 00:37:12,374
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a law?

421
00:37:12,474 --> 00:37:17,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Is chocobo poo used as a flame agent when you're making stuff?

422
00:37:17,518 --> 00:37:17,578
No.

423
00:37:19,423 --> 00:37:23,005
[SPEAKER_01]: The Chocobo Circuit is not going to go live until later this year.

424
00:37:23,065 --> 00:37:24,946
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a patch that rolls out in the fall.

425
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:30,808
[SPEAKER_01]: However, you'll have a good four months or so to breed because the expansion will do that.

426
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:34,150
[SPEAKER_02]: The Circuit, that's just the racing, of course, right?

427
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:38,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, that's the racing, a la Final Fantasy VII, which people have been begging for years.

428
00:37:38,352 --> 00:37:41,393
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to breathe a lot of life back into Final Fantasy XI, I think.

429
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:47,389
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed the game is emptier now than it was six months ago.

430
00:37:47,509 --> 00:37:48,770
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

431
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:51,992
[SPEAKER_03]: I still like the Peko Peko versus the Chocobo.

432
00:37:52,432 --> 00:37:53,453
[SPEAKER_01]: Pimp my Chocobo?

433
00:37:54,073 --> 00:37:56,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the Peko Peko looks like a giant turkey.

434
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:58,696
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to bling out this Chocobo.

435
00:37:58,756 --> 00:38:02,398
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to put an all bass sound system up its ass.

436
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:05,500
[SPEAKER_03]: You Final Fantasy people and your Chocobos.

437
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:06,320
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

438
00:38:07,101 --> 00:38:07,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Look.

439
00:38:08,374 --> 00:38:12,498
[SPEAKER_01]: All we need is if they do a third expansion, then we need Pimp My Moogle, Pimp My Mog House.

440
00:38:12,538 --> 00:38:13,659
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can kind of do the Mog House.

441
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:14,761
[SPEAKER_03]: You can already Pimp Your Mog House.

442
00:38:14,781 --> 00:38:15,661
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but it sucks.

443
00:38:15,822 --> 00:38:16,943
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's not a lot you do with it.

444
00:38:16,983 --> 00:38:18,885
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a plant in my Mog House in a bed.

445
00:38:19,826 --> 00:38:23,209
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not really a lot you do with the Mog House, but everybody's Moogle looks the same.

446
00:38:23,349 --> 00:38:24,991
[SPEAKER_01]: I want a fat Chocobo and I want a fat Moogle.

447
00:38:26,317 --> 00:38:27,497
[SPEAKER_03]: I want my Moogle to dance.

448
00:38:27,558 --> 00:38:28,338
[SPEAKER_03]: I want Mogdance.

449
00:38:28,478 --> 00:38:28,898
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

450
00:38:28,918 --> 00:38:29,698
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need a dancer.

451
00:38:29,738 --> 00:38:30,859
[SPEAKER_01]: We need that to be a character.

452
00:38:31,379 --> 00:38:33,300
[SPEAKER_03]: We have dancers in Ragnarok.

453
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,400
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, shush.

454
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:42,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody in game the other day was trying to sell me up and down that Geomancer is this unannounced fourth character that's going to be in the expansion.

455
00:38:42,103 --> 00:38:44,964
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of like, dude, I think they would have announced it by now.

456
00:38:45,064 --> 00:38:45,485
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

457
00:38:45,945 --> 00:38:46,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Take that with a grain of salt.

458
00:38:48,346 --> 00:38:48,666
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

459
00:38:49,346 --> 00:38:50,447
[SPEAKER_01]: Comments from the chat room.

460
00:38:53,003 --> 00:38:58,087
[SPEAKER_01]: Fireboma says it would actually be more like a Valis fried chocobo, not Kentucky fried chocobo, just so you know.

461
00:38:59,247 --> 00:39:04,431
[SPEAKER_03]: That came from VGCats, Kentucky Faraga chocobo.

462
00:39:05,492 --> 00:39:09,615
[SPEAKER_01]: Rainy says, can the fucking chocobo fly a la Final Fantasy IX?

463
00:39:09,675 --> 00:39:12,337
[SPEAKER_01]: Even in the older Final Fantasies, if you had a black chocobo, it could fly.

464
00:39:13,358 --> 00:39:13,999
[SPEAKER_01]: Thoughts there?

465
00:39:14,539 --> 00:39:17,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Chocobo's like an ostrich, it can't fly.

466
00:39:17,561 --> 00:39:20,904
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Spiritsnare says, if a chocobo ate a chicken, would that be considered cannibalism?

467
00:39:23,223 --> 00:39:23,623
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

468
00:39:24,604 --> 00:39:30,386
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, let's go to the next story, which is also Final Fantasy XI related.

469
00:39:30,446 --> 00:39:30,966
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct, Loki?

470
00:39:31,347 --> 00:39:32,267
[SPEAKER_02]: That's correct.

471
00:39:32,867 --> 00:39:41,931
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've been playing the Final Fantasy XI beta on the 360, well, you've got about until April 2nd before you've got to pony up the cash.

472
00:39:41,951 --> 00:39:48,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Final Fantasy XI is actually coming out on the 17th, which is pretty cool.

473
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:49,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Both the expansion and...

474
00:39:51,625 --> 00:39:52,446
[SPEAKER_02]: The 360 version.

475
00:39:52,466 --> 00:39:54,628
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you own the PlayStation 2 one, you can get the expansion.

476
00:39:55,109 --> 00:39:57,031
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the PC expansion comes out around the same time.

477
00:39:58,853 --> 00:40:03,618
[SPEAKER_02]: However, though, if you have been playing in the beta for the 360, you can transfer your character over.

478
00:40:03,798 --> 00:40:05,460
[SPEAKER_02]: So all that hard work is for naught.

479
00:40:06,328 --> 00:40:35,267
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I want to get Final Fantasy XI on the 360 anymore because I just I got a little bit of a bonus at work so I went and I bought some more RAM for the PC and so now I have two gigs of RAM in this PC and Final Fantasy XI I don't have frame rate issues anymore so it's kind of nice and plus editing this show will go so much faster now which makes me happy so we'll see there's still something to be said though about being able to plop my fat ass on the couch and playing with the controller and everything in my lap laying back

480
00:40:37,229 --> 00:40:54,015
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing you really do, if you are going to go out and buy the 360 version of Final Fantasy XI, please pick up a mouse and keyboard.

481
00:40:54,775 --> 00:40:55,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I agree.

482
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:59,216
[SPEAKER_01]: It's impossible to party without it.

483
00:40:59,376 --> 00:41:03,198
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I shouldn't say it's not impossible, but everybody will hate you.

484
00:41:04,835 --> 00:41:05,596
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

485
00:41:22,924 --> 00:41:24,906
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can only chat via, you know, your friends.

486
00:41:24,946 --> 00:41:30,890
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, via the in-game chat, or the, I'm sorry, in, like, the Xbox 360 global chat thing, right?

487
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:31,311
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

488
00:41:31,451 --> 00:41:31,671
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

489
00:41:31,691 --> 00:41:33,312
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, though, I mean, that's pretty cool.

490
00:41:33,452 --> 00:41:34,233
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean... I guess.

491
00:41:34,453 --> 00:41:34,853
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.

492
00:41:34,933 --> 00:41:39,657
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had friends in Link Shell that also had 360, I suppose that might be cool for a little bit.

493
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:42,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Final Fantasy XI is usually a social thing anyway.

494
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:46,182
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go, that's how I kind of figure, I have some friends online that I pretty much only see there.

495
00:41:46,202 --> 00:41:52,067
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't talk to them on AOL Instant Messenger, so... Anyway, let's move over to another MMO.

496
00:41:52,952 --> 00:41:53,333
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura

497
00:42:07,262 --> 00:42:16,928
[SPEAKER_03]: is a blogger, a big gamer in Japan, and he also thinks that World of Warcraft offers lots of business lessons for how to make companies work better.

498
00:42:17,849 --> 00:42:34,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, his idea with this, the point was that employers do better, they need to make sure that they keep their employees happy by being respectful to them and encouraging them to work together to find their common goals without the leaders just pointing out the rules.

499
00:42:38,521 --> 00:42:46,944
[SPEAKER_03]: by giving their people unpleasant tasks and raids and pointing out, you know, you do this, we've got something for you, just do it how you need to do it.

500
00:42:49,426 --> 00:42:54,648
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting because those endgame guilds and stuff can really be like a job sometimes.

501
00:42:54,728 --> 00:43:04,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that I've been addicted to the game enough to actually get into one, but I've heard about that, you know, there's like expectations that sound like harsher expectations at my job.

502
00:43:04,532 --> 00:43:13,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, in these endgame guilds you must show up on certain nights a week and you have to perform these functions and you will be doing this in the raid or you're kicked out of the guild.

503
00:43:13,596 --> 00:43:14,396
[SPEAKER_01]: You're fired.

504
00:43:14,916 --> 00:43:25,271
[SPEAKER_03]: What he's saying is that with the nature of the game, because it forces people to work together to reach your goals, that it parallels how you need in your business to work together to reach your goals.

505
00:43:32,415 --> 00:43:35,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Touches so many other people's job that if we don't work together, it won't get done.

506
00:43:36,516 --> 00:43:38,217
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of parallels with that.

507
00:43:38,277 --> 00:43:41,178
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, this guy is really successful.

508
00:43:41,658 --> 00:43:44,799
[SPEAKER_03]: He's considered to be a very good leader in business.

509
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:47,720
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's got to be something to it.

510
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:48,700
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that.

511
00:43:49,355 --> 00:43:50,156
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

512
00:44:15,524 --> 00:44:17,465
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, I learned a lot.

513
00:44:17,886 --> 00:44:20,948
[SPEAKER_03]: You actually learned a little bit about business and marketing in Ragnarok.

514
00:44:21,368 --> 00:44:21,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

515
00:44:21,928 --> 00:44:23,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Because this was my thing.

516
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:26,431
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a merchant for a long time in Ragnarok Online.

517
00:44:26,891 --> 00:44:35,036
[SPEAKER_03]: I would take my warps to Komodo, go buy my Iron Arrows at my discount, go back and sell them for three times the price.

518
00:44:35,197 --> 00:44:40,380
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also had to, when I figured in that price, I would figure in how much does it cost for me to warp there,

519
00:44:41,315 --> 00:44:42,357
[SPEAKER_03]: How much is it going to be?

520
00:44:42,477 --> 00:44:44,260
[SPEAKER_03]: What is my profit margin going to be?

521
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:45,702
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you learn a lot.

522
00:44:45,742 --> 00:44:49,588
[SPEAKER_01]: In Final Fantasy XI, it was the same thing with auction house versus NPCs.

523
00:44:49,608 --> 00:44:51,571
[SPEAKER_01]: You learn a lot about supply and demand.

524
00:44:51,891 --> 00:44:54,114
[SPEAKER_01]: And one money-making trick, I'll go ahead and spill it.

525
00:44:54,154 --> 00:44:54,555
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.

526
00:44:54,875 --> 00:44:56,498
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think anybody's going to copy me, but we'll see.

527
00:44:56,998 --> 00:44:59,839
[SPEAKER_01]: One money-making trick I've been using right now is that I notice is very similar.

528
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:05,500
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to a certain NPC, you can buy a certain piece of armor for about 1,000 gil.

529
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,581
[SPEAKER_01]: It sells to the auction house for 8,000 gil.

530
00:45:07,881 --> 00:45:08,801
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can kind of buy it there.

531
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:11,262
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people go, oh, that's wrong, that's wrong.

532
00:45:11,322 --> 00:45:12,642
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, well, okay.

533
00:45:12,662 --> 00:45:13,443
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the real world.

534
00:45:13,463 --> 00:45:14,443
[SPEAKER_01]: They could go.

535
00:45:14,783 --> 00:45:16,583
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, in a way, that's the real world.

536
00:45:16,663 --> 00:45:18,624
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how business works.

537
00:45:18,864 --> 00:45:22,465
[SPEAKER_01]: When you buy a game, an imported Japanese game...

538
00:45:23,331 --> 00:45:26,012
[SPEAKER_01]: You're paying extra because they brought it in for you.

539
00:45:26,032 --> 00:45:26,893
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fascinating to me.

540
00:45:26,913 --> 00:45:27,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's how it works.

541
00:45:27,693 --> 00:45:30,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, for example, soda, a fountain drink.

542
00:45:30,315 --> 00:45:30,555
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

543
00:45:30,795 --> 00:45:33,276
[SPEAKER_03]: When you buy a fountain drink, do you know how much the syrup you use costs?

544
00:45:33,316 --> 00:45:33,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Like three cents.

545
00:45:34,077 --> 00:45:34,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Three cents.

546
00:45:34,537 --> 00:45:35,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know how much you're paying for your soda?

547
00:45:35,918 --> 00:45:36,558
[SPEAKER_03]: About two dollars.

548
00:45:36,758 --> 00:45:37,498
[SPEAKER_01]: At the movie theater?

549
00:45:37,759 --> 00:45:38,099
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot.

550
00:45:38,179 --> 00:45:38,619
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot.

551
00:45:38,799 --> 00:45:39,639
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how they make all their money.

552
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Or even at a restaurant.

553
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,821
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's the same thing.

554
00:45:42,221 --> 00:45:46,923
[SPEAKER_03]: I was actually selling the arrows for as much as a person would normally buy them in-game.

555
00:45:47,524 --> 00:45:50,045
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if they took the time to go to Komodo to buy it.

556
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:56,722
[SPEAKER_03]: but instead I bring it to them, charge them the same price, they think they're getting the better end of the deal when in fact I'm making double profit.

557
00:45:58,382 --> 00:46:00,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Because merchants have discounts.

558
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:06,064
[SPEAKER_01]: See, if MMOs had been around when I was learning economy in high school, I would have done so much better.

559
00:46:06,344 --> 00:46:07,844
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what we did in my economics class?

560
00:46:08,285 --> 00:46:09,085
[SPEAKER_03]: We played the stock market.

561
00:46:09,645 --> 00:46:11,445
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even remember my economics class.

562
00:46:11,865 --> 00:46:12,686
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember sleeping.

563
00:46:12,786 --> 00:46:14,546
[SPEAKER_03]: We invested in Intel and a morgue.

564
00:46:15,046 --> 00:46:15,606
[SPEAKER_01]: I cheated.

565
00:46:16,887 --> 00:46:17,427
[SPEAKER_01]: I would...

566
00:46:18,254 --> 00:46:30,835
[SPEAKER_01]: I was friends with this girl, we were both kind of outcasts, we were nerdy kids I was friends with this girl in economics class, we just kind of talked the whole way through I picked a funeral home, because people are dying to get in

567
00:46:32,344 --> 00:46:33,085
[SPEAKER_01]: Boo!

568
00:46:33,405 --> 00:46:33,985
[SPEAKER_01]: Boo!

569
00:46:34,025 --> 00:46:35,366
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, that was my logic.

570
00:46:35,986 --> 00:46:37,207
[SPEAKER_03]: And my classmates agreed with me.

571
00:46:37,908 --> 00:46:39,889
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was actually one of our faster moving stocks.

572
00:46:40,069 --> 00:46:49,294
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought a stock that, or we played the stock exchange thing too, and I spent all my money on a stock that was 1.64th of a cent, and it doubled in price.

573
00:46:50,294 --> 00:46:52,075
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I made twice my money.

574
00:46:52,756 --> 00:46:53,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job.

575
00:46:54,620 --> 00:47:00,702
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, moving on from economics lessons, let's learn about legal lessons, also can be learned in World of Warcraft.

576
00:47:02,843 --> 00:47:09,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically what's going on is that Blizzard asked this guy on eBay to stop selling this unofficial guide.

577
00:47:11,186 --> 00:47:15,047
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy that was selling the guide was a 24-year-old Brian Kopp of Bronson, Florida.

578
00:47:15,087 --> 00:47:19,689
[SPEAKER_01]: He was selling the Ultimate World of Warcraft Leveling and Gold Guide on eBay.

579
00:47:20,249 --> 00:47:23,574
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was basically his own guy that he put together.

580
00:47:23,834 --> 00:47:28,660
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was unauthorized, so Blizzard basically sent the smackdown.

581
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:35,989
[SPEAKER_01]: They filed a complaint and it alleges... They're basically saying to this kid, don't do this.

582
00:47:36,429 --> 00:47:38,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he's not taking this...

583
00:47:38,974 --> 00:47:39,354
[SPEAKER_01]: and DarkSakura.com.

584
00:48:07,325 --> 00:48:09,226
[SPEAKER_01]: and this guy's really standing up for himself.

585
00:48:09,666 --> 00:48:10,266
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think, though?

586
00:48:10,286 --> 00:48:10,646
[SPEAKER_01]: Good for him.

587
00:48:11,706 --> 00:48:19,948
[SPEAKER_01]: But do you think, I mean, while it's human nature we want to cheer the underdog on, is it right for him to be selling these unauthorized guides on eBay?

588
00:48:20,208 --> 00:48:29,071
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that it was right for him to necessarily use the screenshots because the only time that you can really use, and I recently looked this up due to me winning an argument on DDR Freak.

589
00:48:31,295 --> 00:48:46,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair use, you have to... Just to go ahead and give a slight overview to it, you have to either edit the picture to some extent, or you can use copyrighted material like reproduction for news for education.

590
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:51,774
[SPEAKER_03]: But this, I wouldn't necessarily qualify as under education.

591
00:48:51,874 --> 00:48:54,276
[SPEAKER_03]: It more qualifies under entertainment.

592
00:48:56,098 --> 00:48:56,659
[SPEAKER_03]: If he were...

593
00:48:57,723 --> 00:49:27,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing, like say he was writing an editorial on World of Warcraft Then yeah, he'd be able to use quotes from the game He'd be able to use screenshots Because that falls under fair use So I think that's probably where the judge is going to have to make the determination Is what does this qualify as I think he would be able to continue with his work But he couldn't use the screenshots Especially that in particular Because basically it just sounds like he's written an overblown FAQ Essentially And so, you know, if Blizzard was going to have a problem with that They would have been shutting down all the FAQs up on GameFAQs

594
00:49:27,512 --> 00:49:31,894
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, no, I think their problem is, well, GameFAQs doesn't, well, I mean, I guess that's wrong.

595
00:49:31,914 --> 00:49:40,177
[SPEAKER_01]: GameFAQs does make money off their advertising and stuff, but it's a little bit of a, you know, they walk a fine line, too, because they're really not making money off the games.

596
00:49:40,197 --> 00:49:42,718
[SPEAKER_03]: The information they present is owned by the people who presented it.

597
00:49:42,778 --> 00:49:43,178
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.

598
00:49:43,219 --> 00:49:44,039
[SPEAKER_03]: They just host it.

599
00:49:44,259 --> 00:49:44,419
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

600
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:52,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Therefore, they're not claiming ownership to the material within, they're not claiming, they did not produce any of the information.

601
00:49:52,182 --> 00:49:55,464
[SPEAKER_03]: It was individual people that produced the information, so they're perfectly fine.

602
00:49:56,304 --> 00:49:56,484
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.

603
00:49:58,444 --> 00:49:59,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.

604
00:49:59,444 --> 00:50:01,205
[SPEAKER_01]: Another life lesson to be learned here.

605
00:50:01,265 --> 00:50:02,705
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess we'll see what happens.

606
00:50:02,986 --> 00:50:06,267
[SPEAKER_01]: At least, you know, whoever's right or wrong, we don't know really.

607
00:50:06,347 --> 00:50:15,590
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I think it's good that this guy is sticking up for himself and, you know, what he believes in and is going to fight this and doesn't, you know, just take it like I think a lot of people would.

608
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:16,490
[SPEAKER_01]: So good for him.

609
00:50:17,958 --> 00:50:19,160
[SPEAKER_01]: And best of luck to him.

610
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:19,900
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see what happens.

611
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:22,062
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll follow this story and let you know what happens.

612
00:50:22,923 --> 00:50:25,785
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving on, let's go over to Loki.

613
00:50:26,646 --> 00:50:31,090
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting punishment in another MMO that I had never heard about until this week, right?

614
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:31,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

615
00:50:32,031 --> 00:50:35,394
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I always thought, what's my MMO missing?

616
00:50:35,774 --> 00:50:37,336
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would be Crucifixion.

617
00:50:38,136 --> 00:50:39,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely Crucifixion.

618
00:50:40,376 --> 00:50:42,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.

619
00:51:05,305 --> 00:51:06,586
[SPEAKER_03]: That's historically accurate though.

620
00:51:08,287 --> 00:51:09,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you see the pictures?

621
00:51:09,488 --> 00:51:11,369
[SPEAKER_01]: There were actually pictures on the internet of this.

622
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:22,357
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually showed the guy and all these people in game standing around the cross and there's this sad little man on there just kind of hanging there and everybody's just kind of talking about it.

623
00:51:22,917 --> 00:51:29,819
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that there's of course a definite potential there for people to get their panties all in a bunch and go, oh, that's sacrilegious.

624
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:32,940
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, but you're playing a historically... It's historically accurate!

625
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:45,104
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to play an MMO that's historically accurate and that kind of, if I'm not mistaken, this game kind of, it's big marketing niche is that, you know, be in the historically accurate Roman times, right?

626
00:51:45,184 --> 00:51:48,805
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be historically accurate, but we're going to leave out how they kill people.

627
00:51:49,437 --> 00:51:50,618
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't think they're going to do it.

628
00:51:50,799 --> 00:51:51,379
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, they're not.

629
00:51:52,521 --> 00:51:55,584
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that we're going to get the, oh, you have to get out of the game, blah, blah, blah.

630
00:51:55,724 --> 00:51:58,267
[SPEAKER_01]: No, people would be stupid to get their panties in a bunch over this.

631
00:51:58,347 --> 00:51:59,909
[SPEAKER_03]: But people are stupid.

632
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:07,858
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to play an online game that's cute and play something on the DS that's very colorful and friendly, don't play...

633
00:52:08,863 --> 00:52:10,544
[SPEAKER_01]: Emulation of Ancient Rome.

634
00:52:10,644 --> 00:52:11,585
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, come on.

635
00:52:11,665 --> 00:52:17,028
[SPEAKER_03]: What I mean is there are these people there who are just that stupid who are going to say something about it.

636
00:52:17,048 --> 00:52:18,929
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.

637
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:19,489
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a shot.

638
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:20,130
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.

639
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:21,331
[SPEAKER_03]: That is so neat.

640
00:52:23,272 --> 00:52:24,873
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just kind of... Well, no.

641
00:52:24,993 --> 00:52:28,255
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's... I love studying history.

642
00:52:29,082 --> 00:52:29,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Death, the MMO

643
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,101
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be so... You want Faces of Death, the MMO, or something that's disgusting.

644
00:53:01,201 --> 00:53:02,442
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no, no.

645
00:53:03,022 --> 00:53:07,443
[SPEAKER_03]: I want, like... I have my MMO.

646
00:53:07,864 --> 00:53:08,904
[SPEAKER_01]: Comments from the chatroom.

647
00:53:08,964 --> 00:53:11,765
[SPEAKER_01]: Legend of Zaku says, The passion of the MMORPG.

648
00:53:12,685 --> 00:53:14,666
[SPEAKER_01]: A little play on something else.

649
00:53:14,706 --> 00:53:15,747
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the screenshots here.

650
00:53:15,827 --> 00:53:18,928
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's like, Vondum says, No throwing dung.

651
00:53:18,988 --> 00:53:19,828
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too expensive.

652
00:53:19,968 --> 00:53:20,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Use apples.

653
00:53:20,889 --> 00:53:21,729
[SPEAKER_02]: They are cheaper.

654
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:24,550
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

655
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:26,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go to another story.

656
00:53:27,031 --> 00:53:27,151
[SPEAKER_01]: And...

657
00:53:28,086 --> 00:53:28,987
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

658
00:53:51,323 --> 00:53:57,568
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, the podcast has been keeping my sanity from Wednesday to Friday as I made my way to and from jury duty.

659
00:54:20,074 --> 00:54:21,735
[SPEAKER_01]: Anywho... Poor bastard, I'm sorry.

660
00:54:22,035 --> 00:54:24,436
[SPEAKER_03]: The purpose of this email is to clarify the Tetris issue.

661
00:54:24,736 --> 00:54:29,517
[SPEAKER_03]: From what I remember, Bulletproof Software owned the rights to Tetris after Nintendo released it for the NES.

662
00:54:29,937 --> 00:54:37,000
[SPEAKER_03]: The Tengen Virtus, which is the best version in my humble opinion, was illegally obtained through and through lawsuits Nintendo won.

663
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,301
[SPEAKER_03]: The Tengen version was deemed illegal and to this day is...

664
00:54:40,621 --> 00:55:04,771
[SPEAKER_01]: blah blah is considered a pretty penny if you can get your hands on it which I got mine like for $12 you know what I disagree on Tengen Tetris being this like I think it's a little bit overrated just because it is such a collector's item I don't think it's as great as people say it is Tengen Tetris had co-op mode it did but you know I just it's still I'm reading this letter alright I'm fine sorry and I'm interjecting my opinion that's what I do here

665
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:14,140
[SPEAKER_03]: After that, the rights went to another company called Blue Planet Software and they were responsible for PC ports and licensing for a while and then it became the Tetris company.

666
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:18,805
[SPEAKER_03]: And from what I know now, Nintendo licenses Tetris and any variants from them now.

667
00:55:19,326 --> 00:55:20,667
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that clears things up somewhat.

668
00:55:21,428 --> 00:55:23,010
[SPEAKER_01]: That absolutely clears things up.

669
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:24,792
[SPEAKER_03]: And he also agrees with Loki about Datel.

670
00:55:25,413 --> 00:55:26,274
[SPEAKER_03]: That their products are shit.

671
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:28,621
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

672
00:55:46,613 --> 00:55:49,094
[SPEAKER_03]: We have another email from Roger.

673
00:55:50,115 --> 00:55:52,176
[SPEAKER_03]: So just wanted to drop a note for a periodic listener.

674
00:55:52,196 --> 00:55:57,078
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very glad you guys switched to the 64 KBPS stream format.

675
00:55:57,618 --> 00:55:58,859
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so much easier on the ears now.

676
00:55:58,979 --> 00:56:03,601
[SPEAKER_03]: I also like that you've added a bit more variety to the mix and really hope you don't stray too far from your Bimani roots.

677
00:56:04,301 --> 00:56:07,163
[SPEAKER_03]: On the other hand, I got such a kick out of hearing Pac-Man Fever the other day.

678
00:56:08,203 --> 00:56:10,144
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have the LP of that laying around somewhere.

679
00:56:10,686 --> 00:56:16,329
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we have little bits of randomness in our live 24-hour station that plays the music when we're not doing anything live.

680
00:56:16,609 --> 00:56:21,612
[SPEAKER_01]: And I must say that it's been buffed up now with even more video game music.

681
00:56:21,652 --> 00:56:24,234
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, we will not stray from the Bomani roots.

682
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:32,178
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, we have Beatmania 2DX 13th style, also really the real name is Beatmania 2DX Distorted.

683
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:33,419
[SPEAKER_01]: We have MP3s from that.

684
00:56:33,439 --> 00:56:35,220
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be putting some of those in rotation this week.

685
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:35,961
[SPEAKER_01]: So some new stuff.

686
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:37,482
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a new rendition of Bloody Tears.

687
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:38,142
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty cool.

688
00:56:40,011 --> 00:56:41,212
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really different.

689
00:56:41,692 --> 00:56:43,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't expect it to sound like what you know, but anyway.

690
00:56:44,152 --> 00:56:45,973
[SPEAKER_03]: I got another email from Sycoon.

691
00:56:47,653 --> 00:56:50,974
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty long, so just to go over.

692
00:56:51,594 --> 00:56:53,175
[SPEAKER_03]: TetrisDS, conclusion, sexy.

693
00:56:54,295 --> 00:56:55,195
[SPEAKER_03]: You covered all of them.

694
00:56:55,395 --> 00:56:55,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Agreed.

695
00:56:56,675 --> 00:57:05,197
[SPEAKER_03]: My only complaint, though extremely minor, is that in online Wi-Fi play, the blocks the players get will be different, so you might get stuck with a crappy setup.

696
00:57:05,698 --> 00:57:07,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Another person will breeze through their blocks.

697
00:57:09,016 --> 00:57:14,578
[SPEAKER_01]: I did notice that too, is that the block order is not consistent, which I think is a bit of a disadvantage.

698
00:57:14,638 --> 00:57:17,298
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also not the end of the world.

699
00:57:18,299 --> 00:57:21,559
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what I hate about online multiplayer and Tetris is that goddamn banana.

700
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,360
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's the most frustrating.

701
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,540
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like Shuffle and Tetris.

702
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:25,641
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's the most frustrating item.

703
00:57:26,581 --> 00:57:28,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Another one about DDR Supernova.

704
00:57:29,482 --> 00:57:30,082
[SPEAKER_03]: About Chaos.

705
00:57:30,762 --> 00:57:33,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Counted no less than 43 stops on that song.

706
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:34,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

707
00:57:35,393 --> 00:57:36,055
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

708
00:57:36,196 --> 00:57:38,102
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one song out of, like, what, 200?

709
00:57:38,483 --> 00:57:40,590
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not going to bitch too much, but don't expect me to play this song.

710
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:41,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you learn it, it's going to be easy.

711
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:50,027
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with that song is it's going to get whored out because everybody's going to learn it to show off to the parents and kids at the arcade.

712
00:57:50,047 --> 00:57:51,949
[SPEAKER_03]: I promise you right now I will not learn how to play it.

713
00:57:52,089 --> 00:57:52,349
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

714
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:52,950
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

715
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:53,831
[SPEAKER_01]: At least someone won't.

716
00:57:54,452 --> 00:57:55,072
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't either.

717
00:57:55,092 --> 00:57:56,133
[SPEAKER_03]: I will boycott that song.

718
00:57:56,854 --> 00:57:57,355
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm with you.

719
00:57:57,675 --> 00:57:58,516
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's boycott chaos.

720
00:57:58,536 --> 00:57:59,256
[SPEAKER_01]: Boycott chaos.

721
00:57:59,277 --> 00:57:59,677
[SPEAKER_01]: We're on.

722
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:00,998
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll make an edit to it.

723
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,882
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll play Toxic over and over.

724
00:58:05,062 --> 00:58:05,503
[SPEAKER_01]: No, just kidding.

725
00:58:07,869 --> 00:58:10,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Also a question for us about the controller.

726
00:58:12,253 --> 00:58:14,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Wondering if the controllers are basically going to be switchable.

727
00:58:14,995 --> 00:58:15,676
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, for Beat Media?

728
00:58:15,756 --> 00:58:18,598
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, they will.

729
00:58:18,919 --> 00:58:22,682
[SPEAKER_01]: The only difference is the rounded edge on the turntable side, but it's still flippable, just like the old one.

730
00:58:24,163 --> 00:58:25,765
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have an email from David.

731
00:58:26,505 --> 00:58:27,866
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, Hey guys, I think the shows are great.

732
00:58:27,907 --> 00:58:30,048
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the new format, and I listen to you every week.

733
00:58:30,188 --> 00:58:32,891
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it would be great, though, if you could talk about some LucasArts games.

734
00:58:33,544 --> 00:58:36,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, are you sure that Sony is actually redesigning the PSP?

735
00:58:36,545 --> 00:58:40,066
[SPEAKER_03]: I read an article on Slashdot that said the camera would only be an accessory.

736
00:58:40,486 --> 00:58:44,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Would the games that come out after the new PSP come out still work on the old PSP?

737
00:58:44,508 --> 00:58:45,908
[SPEAKER_02]: The camera is an accessory.

738
00:58:45,968 --> 00:58:48,069
[SPEAKER_02]: It's plugged into the USB port in the top.

739
00:58:48,869 --> 00:58:53,190
[SPEAKER_02]: However, they are still looking at redesigning the PSP to be released later in the fall.

740
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:57,152
[SPEAKER_01]: So... How Nintendo does it, why can't Sony, right?

741
00:58:57,232 --> 00:58:57,592
[SPEAKER_01]: It's both.

742
00:58:57,632 --> 00:58:58,372
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean...

743
00:58:59,409 --> 00:58:59,989
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's good.

744
00:59:22,577 --> 00:59:23,219
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't pay for that.

745
00:59:32,836 --> 00:59:33,176
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

746
00:59:33,196 --> 00:59:37,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, my friend was a tester for that game.

747
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:40,482
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I got on the Skywalker Ranch.

748
00:59:40,562 --> 00:59:43,645
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't this guy talking about, I'm thinking like Loom and stuff.

749
00:59:43,885 --> 00:59:45,006
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I love Loom.

750
00:59:45,046 --> 00:59:45,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what I was going to say.

751
00:59:46,027 --> 00:59:47,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Loom was my favorite.

752
00:59:47,148 --> 00:59:50,310
[SPEAKER_02]: To be honest, there aren't that many LucasArts games coming out now.

753
00:59:51,411 --> 00:59:55,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Star Wars Empire at War just came out, and that one looks really cool.

754
00:59:55,434 --> 00:59:58,537
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really into too much of the RTS stuff on the PC anymore.

755
01:00:00,029 --> 01:00:02,291
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Battlefront 2, I thought that was pretty cool.

756
01:00:04,473 --> 01:00:08,056
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is they only release one game a year, basically.

757
01:00:08,076 --> 01:00:11,258
[SPEAKER_01]: See, when this guy said LucasArts game, my mind instantly went to the old school stuff.

758
01:00:11,278 --> 01:00:13,800
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't even thinking Knights of the Old Republic, okay?

759
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:17,503
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking Indiana Jones, I'm thinking Maniac Mansion.

760
01:00:17,804 --> 01:00:25,070
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm thinking of the new things, just because my friend, when she worked for LucasArts, all I kept hearing her call it was Scrotor.

761
01:00:26,898 --> 01:00:35,306
[SPEAKER_03]: and actually we did get to go to the Skywalker Ranch while she was testing and I was in meatloaf-licking distance of George Lucas.

762
01:00:35,346 --> 01:00:35,867
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty cool.

763
01:00:35,887 --> 01:00:37,168
[SPEAKER_03]: We walked through the cafeteria.

764
01:00:37,408 --> 01:00:41,872
[SPEAKER_01]: PKAkira88 says Super Star Wars, which I would agree is one of my favorite Star Wars games of all time.

765
01:00:42,152 --> 01:00:42,413
[SPEAKER_01]: Rock.

766
01:00:42,713 --> 01:00:44,875
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the debug mode where you can just like breeze through the game.

767
01:00:45,015 --> 01:00:46,236
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, there's your LucasArts content.

768
01:00:46,256 --> 01:00:46,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Just think about that.

769
01:00:46,937 --> 01:00:48,819
[SPEAKER_02]: The LucasArts, what is it?

770
01:00:48,859 --> 01:00:50,480
[SPEAKER_02]: The Star Wars on the Revolution.

771
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:51,181
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be sweet.

772
01:00:51,541 --> 01:00:51,781
[SPEAKER_02]: It will.

773
01:00:52,262 --> 01:00:52,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

774
01:00:53,523 --> 01:00:56,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Twist wrote in about female characters in games.

775
01:00:56,584 --> 01:01:00,225
[SPEAKER_01]: We got quite a response to that little bit last week, didn't we?

776
01:01:00,725 --> 01:01:00,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

777
01:01:01,865 --> 01:01:03,065
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a pretty long one.

778
01:01:03,125 --> 01:01:08,027
[SPEAKER_03]: He's one of the SoCal players and played in Vegas, too.

779
01:01:08,127 --> 01:01:08,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

780
01:01:08,747 --> 01:01:09,267
[SPEAKER_03]: So go ahead.

781
01:01:09,287 --> 01:01:10,627
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to read through this one little part.

782
01:01:10,707 --> 01:01:15,328
[SPEAKER_03]: On the subject of men who use female characters, I only use and look for the female character in almost any game.

783
01:01:15,408 --> 01:01:15,928
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a habit.

784
01:01:16,008 --> 01:01:22,290
[SPEAKER_03]: I use Julia in Tekken, Shang-Hua or Sung-Min in Soul Calibur 3, Pink Yoshi in Melee.

785
01:01:28,942 --> 01:01:33,969
[SPEAKER_01]: And Diablo 2 plays a sorceress.

786
01:01:35,811 --> 01:01:38,815
[SPEAKER_03]: And Street Fighter 3rd Strike Chun-Li is a top character that kicks ass.

787
01:01:39,276 --> 01:01:41,759
[SPEAKER_03]: She is a character I use myself while playing any Street Fighter game.

788
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:42,721
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe...

789
01:01:43,573 --> 01:01:45,813
[SPEAKER_03]: She is a top character in most Street Fighter games.

790
01:01:46,013 --> 01:01:49,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Nina in Tekken 5 is a top character as well, so Fatiha in Soul Calibur 3.

791
01:01:50,234 --> 01:01:51,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Even Peach is a top character in Melee.

792
01:01:52,335 --> 01:01:57,096
[SPEAKER_03]: So people who talk down on female characters are ignorant gamers or sexist, which is why I like to play people like that.

793
01:01:57,516 --> 01:01:58,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Knock some sense into them.

794
01:01:58,636 --> 01:01:59,976
[SPEAKER_03]: I am completely straight male, by the way.

795
01:01:59,996 --> 01:02:04,557
[SPEAKER_02]: This is exactly why I'm going to play Rumble vs. XX.

796
01:02:04,997 --> 01:02:08,078
[SPEAKER_02]: For the awesome, strong, female main character.

797
01:02:08,118 --> 01:02:08,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.

798
01:02:08,738 --> 01:02:09,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, gotcha.

799
01:02:09,598 --> 01:02:10,438
[SPEAKER_03]: One more little thing about...

800
01:02:10,819 --> 01:02:11,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, go ahead.

801
01:02:12,259 --> 01:02:14,840
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also many girls who play in these big tournaments that I go to.

802
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:17,920
[SPEAKER_03]: This one female gamer in the Tekken community is top three in her state.

803
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:19,340
[SPEAKER_03]: And the show is great, by the way.

804
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:19,741
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.

805
01:02:19,801 --> 01:02:21,501
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to take on DarkSakura in Tekken.

806
01:02:21,681 --> 01:02:22,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Any of them.

807
01:02:22,941 --> 01:02:23,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Julia or Michelle Holloway.

808
01:02:23,821 --> 01:02:25,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Thing is, I play Julia.

809
01:02:26,022 --> 01:02:29,142
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also play Jin and Hwoarang, so it's on.

810
01:02:29,822 --> 01:02:31,283
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as we get Tekken online.

811
01:02:31,503 --> 01:02:36,883
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with this letter, except for the fact that Ivy will whoop Sofitia's butt any day.

812
01:02:37,424 --> 01:02:37,804
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

813
01:02:37,824 --> 01:02:38,344
[SPEAKER_01]: Ivy is...

814
01:02:40,185 --> 01:02:40,986
[SPEAKER_01]: Badass, I love her.

815
01:02:41,086 --> 01:02:49,612
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still crazy though, just because as far as the Soul Calibur series, if anyone can play Valdo, oh my god, it's over.

816
01:02:50,693 --> 01:02:56,157
[SPEAKER_03]: I have, no, it's the freaking hardest character to learn and like easily the most hardcore, so.

817
01:02:57,317 --> 01:03:03,822
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you explore your horizons a little bit, play some of the male characters, you may be surprised, but you know, at the same time.

818
01:03:05,343 --> 01:03:09,086
[SPEAKER_03]: I've also got another one on the same line from Macman.

819
01:03:11,158 --> 01:03:12,519
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

820
01:03:40,955 --> 01:03:44,076
[SPEAKER_03]: I picked Jin at first because I was a big Kazuya fan.

821
01:03:44,836 --> 01:03:46,216
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I'm just like, ooh, it's Jin.

822
01:03:46,576 --> 01:03:46,996
[SPEAKER_03]: He's so cool.

823
01:03:47,136 --> 01:03:49,717
[SPEAKER_01]: It really depends on the game I'm playing, honestly.

824
01:03:49,837 --> 01:03:55,598
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't necessarily gravitate towards the female characters, but I agree that Soul Calibur, Ivy's where it's at.

825
01:03:55,798 --> 01:03:58,239
[SPEAKER_01]: But Tekken, I don't know.

826
01:03:58,399 --> 01:04:02,239
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a bit more of a Huarong fan than I was Julia, so who knows.

827
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:05,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Huarong looked like a guy I dated in high school.

828
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:06,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

829
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:07,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

830
01:04:07,801 --> 01:04:08,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, anyway.

831
01:04:09,181 --> 01:04:09,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

832
01:04:10,177 --> 01:04:16,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Also our friend Rob with two B's emailed us with something about Stay Alive.

833
01:04:19,913 --> 01:04:21,075
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll go ahead and read his letter.

834
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:22,924
[SPEAKER_03]: It's filmed very well.

835
01:04:23,024 --> 01:04:23,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Dialogue is okay.

836
01:04:23,845 --> 01:04:24,725
[SPEAKER_03]: The plot is pretty good.

837
01:04:24,845 --> 01:04:28,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, I was the only one in the theater who didn't think it was scary.

838
01:04:28,689 --> 01:04:29,850
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was in the minority.

839
01:04:30,030 --> 01:04:32,272
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you ever played a survival horror, this was tame.

840
01:04:32,352 --> 01:04:35,775
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, I think it's PG-13 because all violence was off camera.

841
01:04:36,295 --> 01:04:44,262
[SPEAKER_03]: On the negative, Frank Venus is still playing a Malcolm-like character when actor was sort of non-existent and another was just awful.

842
01:04:44,502 --> 01:04:50,007
[SPEAKER_03]: The sound editors know nothing about current computer games because the Internet Cafe had an Atari 2600 Donkey Kong sound in the background.

843
01:04:50,747 --> 01:04:53,830
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always that or Atari 2600 Pac-Man sounds in the background.

844
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:55,371
[SPEAKER_03]: When will they ever get it right?

845
01:04:55,931 --> 01:04:57,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Could that be a licensing thing, though?

846
01:04:57,332 --> 01:04:59,053
[SPEAKER_01]: Humor me here for a minute.

847
01:04:59,073 --> 01:05:02,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Could that be maybe that they can't use sounds from current games because then they have to get permission?

848
01:05:03,777 --> 01:05:04,097
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

849
01:05:04,577 --> 01:05:05,078
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a thought.

850
01:05:05,158 --> 01:05:05,598
[SPEAKER_01]: Random thought.

851
01:05:05,998 --> 01:05:07,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me put it this way, though.

852
01:05:07,519 --> 01:05:10,301
[SPEAKER_02]: You could seriously do just the sound effects of an arcade.

853
01:05:10,682 --> 01:05:11,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember Terminator 2?

854
01:05:11,442 --> 01:05:15,665
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be at least more current than... To go ahead and finish this...

855
01:05:19,158 --> 01:05:23,382
[SPEAKER_03]: The writer obviously does video games at least, however, it was a very big ad for Alienware.

856
01:05:23,482 --> 01:05:24,724
[SPEAKER_03]: It was worth a matinee at least.

857
01:05:26,866 --> 01:05:28,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll put it in the Netflix queue.

858
01:05:29,148 --> 01:05:31,630
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about the most that movie's going to get from me.

859
01:05:31,650 --> 01:05:33,793
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, is that it for the mailbag?

860
01:05:33,813 --> 01:05:34,393
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

861
01:05:34,453 --> 01:05:37,096
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's close up the old mailbag and move on to more stories.

862
01:05:37,576 --> 01:05:41,220
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a PlayStation 1 devotee, well...

863
01:05:41,966 --> 01:05:42,847
[SPEAKER_01]: It's over for you.

864
01:05:43,908 --> 01:05:44,388
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really.

865
01:05:44,929 --> 01:05:50,473
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm trying to say is that the PlayStation consoles, the PS1s, are no longer going to be made.

866
01:05:50,654 --> 01:05:54,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Sony has stopped all production of the original PlayStation console.

867
01:05:54,741 --> 01:05:58,442
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, of course, now they need to start focusing their efforts on putting out the PlayStation 3.

868
01:05:58,482 --> 01:06:02,183
[SPEAKER_01]: They haven't made games for the PlayStation 1 in, like, years.

869
01:06:02,803 --> 01:06:04,524
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there was actually a release.

870
01:06:04,984 --> 01:06:05,844
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that was Dreamcast.

871
01:06:05,864 --> 01:06:08,345
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but those are, like, little indie things.

872
01:06:08,405 --> 01:06:09,525
[SPEAKER_01]: No major release in a long time.

873
01:06:09,545 --> 01:06:12,286
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought they stopped production of the PlayStation 1 when, like, the PlayStation 2 came out.

874
01:06:12,306 --> 01:06:12,886
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what, though?

875
01:06:12,946 --> 01:06:16,667
[SPEAKER_01]: For folks that can't afford PS2s, PS1's a nice alternative, right?

876
01:06:16,687 --> 01:06:19,608
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't even want to see the stack of them sitting in our game room.

877
01:06:19,628 --> 01:06:20,568
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so, you know...

878
01:06:22,101 --> 01:06:22,562
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura.com

879
01:06:45,456 --> 01:06:48,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, there's a speculated name coming out.

880
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:57,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, a blog called Engadget got a hold of a photograph from a slide at a Nintendo presentation.

881
01:06:58,009 --> 01:07:05,536
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a blue cube looking thing formed out of the posing D-pads that was hovering over a name that said Nintendo Go.

882
01:07:07,459 --> 01:07:11,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Later on they got a photo that looked like a brochure that had the same name on it.

883
01:07:11,947 --> 01:07:15,653
[SPEAKER_03]: But Iwata hasn't said anything to support that.

884
01:07:16,335 --> 01:07:18,699
[SPEAKER_03]: They said they were supposed to announce the real name and never did.

885
01:07:19,604 --> 01:07:24,428
[SPEAKER_01]: N64 was supposed to be a codename for the Nintendo 64 but it came out as the Nintendo 64.

886
01:07:24,468 --> 01:07:25,989
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've done things like this before.

887
01:07:26,009 --> 01:07:27,570
[SPEAKER_01]: Their codenames have made it as official names.

888
01:07:45,802 --> 01:07:46,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Namo Web Editor 5

889
01:08:08,047 --> 01:08:10,748
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly the same logo as the Nintendo Go.

890
01:08:33,416 --> 01:08:37,737
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're on their fifth handheld system, too, whenever the next one comes out.

891
01:08:37,837 --> 01:08:50,119
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the most creative explanation I read somewhere on the internet on some feedback thread was that Nintendo Go sounds like a good gaming online thing, because if you think GO, gaming online, maybe that's the name of their online system.

892
01:08:50,259 --> 01:08:51,720
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be a definite possibility.

893
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:53,340
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all speculation at this time, though.

894
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:54,080
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

895
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:57,701
[SPEAKER_03]: I just still have this mental image, though, from...

896
01:08:58,692 --> 01:09:02,313
[SPEAKER_03]: The first few episodes of Red Dwarf were... No, not Red Dwarf.

897
01:09:02,353 --> 01:09:02,893
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm asking Red Dwarf.

898
01:09:02,913 --> 01:09:07,354
[SPEAKER_03]: From Star Trek, where everyone was addicted to the little game thing.

899
01:09:09,055 --> 01:09:14,496
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to keep seeing more and more systems come out and they're going to be wired into our brains and we'll all be addicts.

900
01:09:14,837 --> 01:09:16,997
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also an episode of Sequest.

901
01:09:18,418 --> 01:09:19,078
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

902
01:09:19,438 --> 01:09:19,698
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

903
01:09:21,415 --> 01:09:22,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, moving on.

904
01:09:22,776 --> 01:09:24,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Completely different type of game here.

905
01:09:24,276 --> 01:09:25,777
[SPEAKER_01]: StarCraft Ghost.

906
01:09:26,497 --> 01:09:32,079
[SPEAKER_01]: StarCraft Ghost has been indefinitely postponed, and that's going to be a big disappointment there to StarCraft fans.

907
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:41,783
[SPEAKER_01]: They have announced earlier this week that they are going to be focusing the company's console development efforts on the next generation of console platforms.

908
01:09:42,803 --> 01:09:43,924
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this means that...

909
01:09:44,904 --> 01:09:45,785
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

910
01:10:06,451 --> 01:10:10,933
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to go next-gen if it's going to happen at all, which you could look at that either way as good news or bad news.

911
01:10:10,953 --> 01:10:17,635
[SPEAKER_02]: They're probably just thinking, well, hey, by the time this thing comes out, the next-gen systems are going to be launching anyways.

912
01:10:18,595 --> 01:10:19,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Might as well.

913
01:10:19,076 --> 01:10:23,297
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's move over to Jamie, who has a story for us on some wheeling and dealing with Sega.

914
01:10:23,937 --> 01:10:33,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Sega is working with Obsidian to make a role-play game for the PC, the PlayStation 3, and the Xbox 360, but it doesn't have a name or a release date yet.

915
01:10:34,545 --> 01:10:37,347
[SPEAKER_03]: but we are probably going to see stuff on this at E3.

916
01:10:39,528 --> 01:10:45,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Really Sega's been doing a lot more partnerships with a bunch of different companies like Bizarre Creations, Silicon Knights, Monolith.

917
01:10:46,111 --> 01:10:47,872
[SPEAKER_03]: They've just acquired Creative Assembly.

918
01:10:48,413 --> 01:10:50,754
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a UK company.

919
01:10:50,954 --> 01:10:57,918
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing that's really worked out, well with Creative Assembly they had the Total War series.

920
01:10:57,958 --> 01:10:59,559
[SPEAKER_03]: They had Condemned with Monolith.

921
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:01,820
[SPEAKER_03]: But

922
01:11:03,948 --> 01:11:17,655
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as the game that's coming out, though, they say they're really excited to be working together, both companies.

923
01:11:18,195 --> 01:11:24,198
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a quote on here from Fergus Equart, I guess, CEO of Obsidian Entertainment.

924
01:11:25,470 --> 01:11:33,420
[SPEAKER_03]: They're excited to be working with a great publisher like Sega as they are willing and excited to launch new and visionary IP on next generation consoles.

925
01:11:34,856 --> 01:11:38,979
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's very interesting all these little partnerships Sega's doing here and there.

926
01:11:38,999 --> 01:11:40,480
[SPEAKER_01]: They team up with these guys for this game.

927
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:41,601
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of interesting.

928
01:11:43,282 --> 01:11:43,942
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I can really say.

929
01:11:43,962 --> 01:11:46,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Until we see the game, all we can know is, interesting.

930
01:11:46,524 --> 01:11:50,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know I'll be ghosting around Sega's area at E3.

931
01:11:50,246 --> 01:11:50,647
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.

932
01:11:50,667 --> 01:11:51,647
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I missed them last year.

933
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:54,549
[SPEAKER_03]: They had those big comfy chairs.

934
01:11:54,950 --> 01:11:59,332
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Universe was supposed to be out by now, Phantasy Star Universe, but now they've pushed it back.

935
01:11:59,352 --> 01:12:00,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Into the real world.

936
01:12:00,613 --> 01:12:02,715
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see it again at E3 this year, right?

937
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:04,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they will have fixed our complaints.

938
01:12:04,776 --> 01:12:05,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Possibly.

939
01:12:05,417 --> 01:12:05,697
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

940
01:12:06,157 --> 01:12:07,158
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's move on.

941
01:12:07,759 --> 01:12:11,242
[SPEAKER_01]: Also in some wheeling and dealing, of course, Peter Moore is known as the big talker.

942
01:12:11,282 --> 01:12:12,823
[SPEAKER_01]: What's he talking about this week, Loki?

943
01:12:13,384 --> 01:12:14,645
[SPEAKER_01]: Next-gen sequels.

944
01:12:15,005 --> 01:12:16,687
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to love.

945
01:12:17,327 --> 01:12:19,289
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, these are kind of like, duh.

946
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:21,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Duh, this is going to come out.

947
01:12:22,072 --> 01:12:26,055
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, they're talking about a sequel to the Forza franchise.

948
01:12:26,536 --> 01:12:26,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Duh.

949
01:12:26,976 --> 01:12:27,757
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, of course.

950
01:12:27,837 --> 01:12:30,079
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like Gran Turismo on Xbox.

951
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,881
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some of the other ones, they mentioned Fable.

952
01:12:34,201 --> 01:12:34,981
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on.

953
01:12:36,721 --> 01:12:37,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

954
01:12:37,382 --> 01:12:37,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Fable?

955
01:12:37,942 --> 01:12:38,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting a sequel?

956
01:12:38,822 --> 01:12:41,283
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, gee, I didn't know the game did well or anything.

957
01:12:41,683 --> 01:12:48,225
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, Crimson Skies was going to be another one that was going to be getting a sequel, which is great because we need some more aerial combat games.

958
01:12:50,045 --> 01:12:52,506
[SPEAKER_01]: What about the one that just had the demo this week on Xbox?

959
01:12:53,626 --> 01:12:54,887
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, more than that.

960
01:12:55,307 --> 01:12:56,487
[SPEAKER_01]: We need more than one.

961
01:12:56,507 --> 01:12:57,747
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we don't.

962
01:12:58,047 --> 01:12:58,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we do.

963
01:12:58,828 --> 01:12:59,508
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just my opinion.

964
01:12:59,548 --> 01:12:59,988
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we don't.

965
01:13:01,530 --> 01:13:02,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever, okay.

966
01:13:02,891 --> 01:13:08,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, one game that is not going to be getting a sequel is going to be Mecha Assault, because apparently Mecha Assault didn't sell very well.

967
01:13:09,576 --> 01:13:11,238
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay, though, because Chromehounds is coming out.

968
01:13:11,318 --> 01:13:12,138
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I need to hear.

969
01:13:13,339 --> 01:13:14,400
[SPEAKER_01]: Chromehounds and Armored Core.

970
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:15,081
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

971
01:13:15,661 --> 01:13:19,024
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, good job on our duh story of the week for most of that stuff.

972
01:13:20,115 --> 01:13:21,516
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

973
01:13:36,468 --> 01:13:47,922
[SPEAKER_01]: Best Audio, Guitar Hero, Shadow of the Colossus also won Best Character Design, Best Game Design, Best Visual Arts, and also shared honors in Innovation.

974
01:13:48,182 --> 01:13:55,491
[SPEAKER_01]: Guitar Hero also shared innovation along with Nintendogs also got an innovation nod, also winning there for Best Technology.

975
01:13:55,731 --> 01:13:56,031
[SPEAKER_01]: Psychonauts

976
01:14:19,174 --> 01:14:21,916
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

977
01:14:46,167 --> 01:14:49,349
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually part of an art installation right now at a museum.

978
01:14:49,789 --> 01:15:00,195
[SPEAKER_02]: But designer Marcel Neandorfer has actually created urinals with interactive games built in and activated and controlled by streaming media.

979
01:15:01,676 --> 01:15:07,320
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, I don't know.

980
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:10,842
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, it's kind of stupid because streaming.

981
01:15:13,539 --> 01:15:18,663
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really, how long can you be playing a game when you're taking a piss?

982
01:15:18,703 --> 01:15:19,444
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, seriously.

983
01:15:19,684 --> 01:15:20,845
[SPEAKER_01]: What if I'm pee-shy?

984
01:15:21,065 --> 01:15:22,987
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that puts me at a handicap.

985
01:15:23,968 --> 01:15:27,191
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it multiplayer?

986
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:32,335
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they have a trough version of this game for those urinals that are just a big trough?

987
01:15:32,355 --> 01:15:33,015
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what's next?

988
01:15:33,116 --> 01:15:33,836
[SPEAKER_01]: Poo on the target?

989
01:15:33,956 --> 01:15:35,257
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's disgusting.

990
01:15:36,118 --> 01:15:39,601
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, are you going to learn how to pee standing up just to play this game?

991
01:15:39,621 --> 01:15:40,442
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck no!

992
01:15:43,001 --> 01:15:43,664
[SPEAKER_01]: Disgusting.

993
01:15:44,669 --> 01:15:45,835
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so stupid!

994
01:15:47,453 --> 01:15:49,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Only in an art show do we see something like that.

995
01:15:49,274 --> 01:16:05,863
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to go sick and more demented game, whatever, you could get some sort of technology like that that measures the size of the crap that you take, and it puts you on a leaderboard, kind of a ranking system, so that you can see how far you fare against other crappers out there.

996
01:16:06,243 --> 01:16:07,964
[SPEAKER_03]: We already had the game Golden Tee.

997
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:13,026
[SPEAKER_01]: This show has officially gone down the toilet, so I think it's time for us to take a little break here.

998
01:16:13,687 --> 01:16:14,227
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be back...

999
01:16:15,027 --> 01:16:17,628
[SPEAKER_00]: After this little break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
