00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,960
Radio.

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,120
It is March 26, 2006.

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,220
This is episode number 178 and thanks so much for tuning in live or downloading us, whatever

10
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,520
the case may be.

11
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,520
My name is Rob Roberts.

12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,520
You might know me as Sky.

13
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,360
joining me, as always, say hello to the lovely Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers.

14
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,360
Yo.

15
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,160
Oh, I think the mic is off, dear.

16
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,160
No, it was on.

17
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,160
Oh, it wasn't?

18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,160
I don't know.

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,160
I twitched it a little bit.

20
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,160
Weird sound stuff.

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,160
Yo!

22
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,160
There we go.

23
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,160
How you doing?

24
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,160
I'm alive.

25
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,160
That's something.

26
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,160
That's good.

27
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,160
It's good to be alive.

28
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,160
It is.

29
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,160
It is.

30
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,800
Also joining us tonight, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

31
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,800
Hello.

32
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,800
How you doing?

33
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,800
Good.

34
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,800
Good.

35
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,440
Okay, well, we got a lot of news tonight, so I guess we should cut the crap and get

36
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,440
to it.

37
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,440
How was your week? Good week?

38
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,440
All except for certain events.

39
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,440
There were highlights and lowlights?

40
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,440
There were lowlights.

41
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,440
Okay. Which we don't need to get into on a public internet program, correct?

42
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,440
Not really.

43
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,440
How about the highlights?

44
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,440
Tuesday night we had a good time. We went on an Orange Lounge road trip.

45
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,440
Yes we did. We got to meet people.

46
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,440
We got to meet some people from allgames.com who do the syndication of our program.

47
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,440
And I had sushi.

48
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,120
And it was very cool. It was as close as we got to Game Developers Conference.

49
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,820
It's like we got to be in the same city and we were near people that were going to

50
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,880
Game Developers Conference,

51
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,080
although we didn't actually get to go ourselves. So we didn't get to,

52
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,440
we didn't get to go to no bloggers breakfast, so we had to make our own,

53
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:07,960
you know, uh, Cool Kid's, yeah, Cool Kid's Dinner or something like that. I don't know.

54
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,880
No, no, I mean. That place was pretty tasty. It was a good place, wherever that was that we went.

55
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,120
The little, like, Benny, not,

56
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,280
it's not Benny Hana's. Semi Hana's. Yeah, Semi Hana's. It was, it was Genji.

57
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,000
I just thought the name was cool because I got to make a Namco reference to it.

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,440
The Genji in Heike Clan.

59
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,360
Big thanks to our pals over at AllGames.com for meeting up with us and

60
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,560
definitely more to come on what we're doing with them in the future but for now

61
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,840
let's get into our program and we always like to start off with a little bit of

62
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,200
how was your gaming week and what kind of stuff have you been playing this week?

63
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,840
Dark Sakura, what kind of games have you been into?

64
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,120
Well I haven't been able to do a lot of gaming.

65
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:53,040
I sprained my wrist last Friday, so I've been kinda not able to use the D-Pad very well

66
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,220
until a couple days ago.

67
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:59,760
We picked up Tetris DS, and I haven't actually got to play it yet because I can't get it

68
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,200
away from Dan.

69
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,360
Which must mean it's pretty good.

70
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,600
I haven't played any Animal Crossing at all this week.

71
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,600
Congratulations.

72
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,960
I've been playing lots of Ragnarok online, because I can use my mouse.

73
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:17,760
I am now level 52 38 thief and then I have like an archer and I have a merchant that

74
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,720
I've started too and uh Dan also picked up the initial D game for PSP which comes with

75
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,600
a lanyard it was pretty cool um I heard lots of eurobeat pouring out of the living room

76
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:33,360
as I left the house today so uh that's what the uh game oh he's been playing a lot of

77
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:40,180
burnout which I'm like whatever that game does not end in the least why not it looks

78
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,680
Stupid it's about what the sixth racing game to come out for Xbox 360

79
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,800
I get tired of there being nothing but racing games in my house

80
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,480
You know it may be fun for people, but it looks like more of the same crap

81
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,720
He's been playing for like the past three months, and I'm sick of it

82
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:01,440
That's because they're most of the racing well actually it's what EA no need for speed most wanted and burnout look exactly the same

83
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,460
Or pretty close at least because you know they're both ports of

84
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:11,460
of the Xbox version with better textures, I guess, and stuff.

85
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,460
Um, I don't know, there's not that...

86
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,460
Well, I guess there are some racing games out there.

87
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:20,460
Uh, let's see. Project Gotham, Full Auto, Ridge Racer...

88
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,460
No, no, Full Auto's not really a racing game.

89
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,460
Well, okay...

90
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,460
Sorta, kinda.

91
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,460
There's plenty, come on.

92
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,460
I guess.

93
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,460
Alright.

94
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,460
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week? What'd you been playing?

95
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:39,460
I'm playing a lot of stuff actually. I'll start off, I bought me my Katamari and that's

96
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:43,980
pretty fun. It looks really pretty on the PSP, that's for sure. It doesn't control

97
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:51,180
too well. I don't really like how they do the directional pad and the four buttons instead

98
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,660
of two analogs, but what are you going to do with the PSP? But it is very pretty, and

99
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,340
if you do play it for a while you do eventually get used to the controls, although they do

100
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:05,500
make your hand hurt a bit. Then of course I played a little bit of Grand Theft Auto

101
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:15,060
Liberty City Stories as usual. And also I've been playing on the 360. Was it? I finally

102
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:22,660
got all my achievements unlocked in full auto today. And also I played a little bit of Oblivion

103
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:28,660
and that game is just huge. It's very pretty but just really huge. Like today I was like

104
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:33,220
you know I see a mountain over there I'm gonna go walk that direction and sure

105
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,420
enough you can pretty much climb to the top of that mountain and meanwhile I was

106
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,940
you know sneaking around through the dark and I see deer so I throw fireballs

107
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:46,260
and kill the deer because I can and other fun things like I pit pocketed a

108
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:50,540
key from this one guy in town and went to his house stole all this stuff and

109
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:56,060
dumped it on the street because I can I'm a jackass in the game I didn't

110
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,140
really play the game enough to give it a full review, but I did notice that everything was

111
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:05,740
very big, like there was just lots to do, like even when it came down to the customization

112
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:10,220
of your character, like you know, let's say you want to customize the mouth, well okay,

113
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:15,180
in most games I've played to date, you pick from like 10 or so preset mouths for your

114
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,140
character, if you're even that lucky, if you even get to narrow it down that far.

115
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:22,520
Okay, this game like would let you adjust like the size of the lips, like you could

116
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,880
go for like big old Angelina Jolie Stephen Tyler style lips or small lips

117
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,600
you can make him smile for I mean like it was like oh my it was almost too much

118
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:36,880
like I was like okay this is too much detail for me I mean like fun I love

119
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,880
customizing yeah but I'm like I'm like okay I'm here to I'm here to kill things

120
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,880
and set things on fire not play Barbie dress-up with my character but hey

121
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,160
Barbie dress-up is pretty darn fun but you know I just I it's cool I'm not

122
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,360
going to knock the game for having that, but I was a little bit taken aback, because I'm

123
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,040
like, okay, I'm just starting this game, and already I feel like really overwhelmed. And

124
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,320
of course, Loki was showing it to me, and he's like telling me everything to do, okay,

125
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,520
press this button, press this button, okay, press this, then this, then this, and this,

126
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,340
and this. I'm like, oh my gosh, this is like overwhelming. But then I thought about like

127
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,840
when I played Final Fantasy XI for the first time, I kind of felt the same way, so I know

128
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,540
it's just one of those games you have to get used to.

129
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:17,800
It's not that hard once you get through it, no. So anyways, of course, you know, there

130
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,520
was a little leak out there about how there's a glitch with one character where you can

131
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,800
kill him and get infinite gold. Well I went and tried to kill this guy and god dammit

132
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:33,040
he keeps running away. I can't kill him fast enough. Even if I sneak up on him I just can't

133
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:38,460
do it. Which is surprising because you'd think if you hit somebody with a double-edged, two-handed

134
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:42,960
sword really hard in the back when they weren't expecting it you'd think eh they're probably

135
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,420
gonna be on the ground you know but damn I can whack away at this guy and he

136
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:50,640
freaking puts up fight and then runs away like a coward it's like holy shit

137
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,200
I mean if I was getting hit with a sword they would be down whatever anyways but

138
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:01,200
yeah tons of stuff to do in this game I don't even know it's a long game very

139
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:08,240
very long I played the was a blazing angels demo that was fun I especially

140
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,440
loved taking off and then turning back around and shooting the people that were

141
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:17,240
on the ground in my headquarters. That was fun. Didn't like it too much. Kept crashing

142
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:24,900
in the buildings though, because I suck at flight sims. And, god, what else did I play?

143
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:33,160
Some more, was it Geometry Wars? That's kind of cool.

144
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:38,080
Very cool. You know, if Oblivion had came out when it was first originally supposed

145
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,560
to be out, like not quite as the launch title, but what, like end of December was the original

146
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,720
time frame for the game, right? I think I would have had a chance to play it, but now

147
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:51,580
it's kind of like, okay, in my imaginary game queue in my head of the games I want to play

148
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:56,160
and in the order I want to play them, unfortunately Oblivion's kind of like way down on the list

149
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,080
now because there's all these other games that came out in the past two weeks that are

150
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,560
more important for me right now. It's a bummer that game didn't come out two months ago or

151
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,000
I might have been more interested, but now it's like, ooh, Kingdom Hearts is coming and

152
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,360
be honest I'm glad they waited because it looks

153
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,840
looks good. Well yeah, to make the game better

154
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,240
I mean fine but you know it's just too bad that it didn't happen when it was

155
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,880
originally supposed to because I probably would have

156
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,640
wanted to play it more but honestly it's only so many hours in a day so... The only bad

157
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,640
thing about the game

158
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,920
is the load times. Gotta love the load times. It's just

159
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,320
super long to get started and then each area's

160
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,120
loading and stuff. I do like the feature where you can quick travel if you're, you know,

161
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,400
cause

162
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:41,280
Imagine running for like hours and hours. No, not fun, but um you can do like quick travel and stuff

163
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:47,580
Which is pretty cool. I did get stuck behind a rock one time in a cave because hey

164
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:54,100
I'm gonna go back there and the problem is if you don't land on the ground it won't let you jump again

165
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,480
So I got stuck

166
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,600
I wasn't quite you know

167
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:02,160
I was kind of clipped on the rock and I couldn't quite touch the ground so wouldn't let me jump so I was I could

168
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:08,100
not move, which was really fun. Luckily the game does autosave every now and then, so

169
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:13,340
I was able to go back to my autosave and just do a few more things and I'm done. The other

170
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:16,840
great thing about the game is you can actually, anything you see, you can pretty much pick

171
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:23,760
up, steal, take, wear, break, I don't know, it's just a lot to, I mean, you can wander

172
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,220
around the fields and you see a flower, pick a flower. I mean, if you see a mushroom, pick

173
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,220
the mushroom. Find some cow poo, wear it on your head.

174
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:34,540
It's probably would let you, it's very thorough.

175
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,540
Okay, any other games you've been playing this week? No.

176
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:43,180
Alright, my gaming week, you know I spend a little time customizing my Xbox 360

177
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:43,620
because

178
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,340
you can, you know, link it up to your PC to play music off your PC and look at

179
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,620
pictures from your PC.

180
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,140
So I finally played with this feature a little bit this week because for some

181
00:10:53,140 --> 00:11:10,140
For some wacky reason, I thought that you could also stream movies from your PC, but I guess you have to have Media Center to do that, which I don't, but I went to the hassle to set it up anyway, only to be disappointed, but it's still kind of neat that you can, you know, use music from your computer as custom soundtracks to games and stuff, and use the pictures.

182
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:22,140
Well, one other thing that you can do with the pictures is that you can actually change the theme on your Xbox 360 to be one of the pictures from that, so you can, like, set your own background, essentially, by doing that.

183
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:29,140
I thought to be ironic, what I did is I went onto Nintendo's website and I downloaded a background for Mario Kart DS

184
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,140
and I put that background in the share folder

185
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:37,140
and so now when I bring up my Xbox 360, it's got this big Nintendo Mario Kart DS background

186
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:41,140
so I'll have to take a picture of it and put it on the forums just to be cute

187
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,140
I don't know why I did it, I thought it would be funny

188
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:49,140
I guess there's only some things only I find amusing, I don't know, maybe some of you out there find that amusing

189
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:54,500
As far as actual games I was playing, speaking of Xbox, I downloaded Astro Pop in the Xbox

190
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,500
Live Arcade.

191
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:03,140
I'm a little bit over the love affair with PopCap-style games, and Astro Pop was a game

192
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:08,900
I really liked an awful lot back when it was called Magical Drop.

193
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:14,340
I played Astro Pop a little bit on the PC, but when I played on the Xbox 360, the thrill

194
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,700
was kind of gone after a couple rounds.

195
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,900
It wasn't really a long-lasting game for me.

196
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:23,740
I don't like the fact that they're charging $10 for these games when gems like Geometry

197
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,860
Wars are only $5.

198
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,180
Don't think I can really recommend Astro Pop unless you're really, really into the puzzle

199
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,740
games, in which case you've probably already downloaded this and you know this game is

200
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,480
for you.

201
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,340
Speaking of puzzlers, here's a game now that's worth every penny.

202
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,200
Tetris DS just came out for the Nintendo DS this week.

203
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,720
It is awesome.

204
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:49,060
I think the thing with Tetris is that we know there has been a crap load of Tetris games

205
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,760
since Tetris on the Game Boy.

206
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,980
For instance, I know there was a really big one on the PlayStation, but none of the Tetris

207
00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:00,380
games have been very memorable and nothing has really matched that bar that Game Boy

208
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,380
Tetris set.

209
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,660
We will leave it to Nintendo to come back and do it again and make their game memorable,

210
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:10,960
which they have done I think by inserting all these cute 8-bit retro things with the

211
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:16,720
music and all these new modes, there's just huge amounts of new modes, the catch mode

212
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,320
and the touch mode and the puzzle mode, just all this stuff to keep you busy, and then

213
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,620
of course you can take it online, and I think the great thing about being able to play it

214
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,420
online is that it's a real quick game that you can play online.

215
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:33,620
I kind of wish that you could play online in an unranked setting, the only way you could

216
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,660
do that is by playing people on your friends list, and then on the reverse side you can't

217
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,980
ranked matches against your friends, so either you play against strangers in a ranked match

218
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,960
or friends in another ranked match, there's really no in-between, but that's probably

219
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,580
only my minor gripe.

220
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:52,900
Otherwise this game is magnificent, and if you're a puzzle fan, you must have this game,

221
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,700
it's a must-own game.

222
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:59,060
If you're not a puzzle fan yet, I still say check it out.

223
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:02,920
If you have any type of fond memories of Tetris and the Game Boy, this game is really worth

224
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,920
your money.

225
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,720
time, so I definitely recommend Tetris DS.

226
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,840
Many new modes to keep you busy, just so many new modes and stuff.

227
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,120
I think there's still unlockable things too, I haven't even gotten to yet, so more to come

228
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,120
on that.

229
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,040
I'll have to check game FAQs and see what's to be unlocked, because I'm sure there's something.

230
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,880
I heard something about 10,000 Tetris points gets you something, but we'll see.

231
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:29,440
Anyway, other games I've been playing this week, I also picked up Metroid Prime Hunters,

232
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,840
which is the 3D Metroid game which had the demo that was packed in with the DS initially.

233
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,180
The game's gotten a little bit of a facelift since the demo, I mean obviously it's been

234
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,180
like over a year now, and I've been playing the game.

235
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,120
It's got a very interesting control scheme.

236
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,400
You can pick from different control styles, you don't have to use the stylus, but using

237
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,960
the stylus kind of makes the most sense.

238
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,840
But what I kind of find is that you really have to find the right position for yourself

239
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,900
to play this game, or you can really hurt your arm, like it really can make your arm

240
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,880
sore to play this game, I kind of found.

241
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:02,600
And I did not like the fact, I seem to recall in the demo that the map was always on the

242
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,140
bottom screen, like you kind of got a 2D representation, that's gone.

243
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:13,100
Like you can pause the game to get a 3D map, a la Descent type thing, but it sucks.

244
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,520
I don't like the map at all.

245
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:21,280
I don't know what happened, and that really wrecked it for me in some ways, because 3D

246
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:25,480
games are kind of weird enough for me, I'm a very map-oriented person, so I was a little

247
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,480
unhappy with that.

248
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,920
It wasn't very clear also how to save your game, a lot of the how to get into the game

249
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,100
and stuff wasn't very clear to me.

250
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,980
If you like the Metroid games on GameCube, I don't see why you wouldn't like this.

251
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,580
I haven't tried the online mode yet, but I'm sure it's a lot of fun.

252
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,000
But honestly, I don't think it's really worth all the hype.

253
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,500
I don't think Metroid Prime Hunters is quite the game it really could have been for me.

254
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,700
I don't know.

255
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,320
Maybe I'm just being a little harsh because there were just a couple things that really

256
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:00,600
bugged me about it, but I really can only recommend this title to you if you like the

257
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,160
the other action style games.

258
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,320
Otherwise, rent it, borrow it from a friend,

259
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,120
try it out in the store before you buy it,

260
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,440
and don't base your opinion off the demo

261
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,840
that was packed in with the original DS

262
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,840
because quite a bit has changed, so that's that.

263
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,760
Okay, so that's it for our gaming weeks.

264
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,920
Let's move on to some news, and of course,

265
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,460
the big, big news this week was Game Developers Conference,

266
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,120
which happened over this past week,

267
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,200
which we almost went to.

268
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,040
We were standing next door to it, but we didn't really go.

269
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,120
We had to read about it on the internet, just like you guys, but here's a quick summary

270
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,120
of what happened.

271
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,400
So, Loki, you're going to go down kind of company by company here, and we'll talk about

272
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,400
it a little bit.

273
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,400
Yeah.

274
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,400
What did Sony talk about?

275
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,400
Okay.

276
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,560
Well, Sony, of course, their big thing was talking about the PlayStation 3, and the PSP,

277
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,020
and all that fun stuff.

278
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:56,440
And really, they were just kind of talking about what they're going to do as far...

279
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,640
One of the games they announced was God of War 2, which they showed the demo for, and

280
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,640
it looked awesome, of course.

281
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:06,320
You know, God of War was one of the best games before the PlayStation 2, so it makes sense

282
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,840
that they're going to make the second one.

283
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:12,360
Then of course they talked a little bit about the PSP and what changes are going to come

284
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:20,680
to it, including both the GPS, which is coming out later this year, and also the iToy, which

285
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,920
is going to be coming out later this year for it as well.

286
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:29,440
New web browser of course with improved RSS channel and Macromedia Flash which is going

287
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,640
to be great.

288
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,220
That's actually coming in the next update.

289
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:39,140
And then with the video camera they're actually going to have a Wi-Fi video phone option for

290
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,140
it as well.

291
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:50,220
So I don't know, not quite side talking but pretty close, interesting nonetheless.

292
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,960
Another thing they announced though was that LocoRoco is coming to the PSP, and that's

293
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,300
kind of like the game almost similar to the Katamari, since it's a very awkward, strange

294
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,900
Japanese game that they're bringing over here.

295
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:08,740
Always makes sense seeing as Katamari is leaving and quitting while they're ahead, so to speak.

296
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:12,820
Gotta try and find something to fill that gap in the quirky game category.

297
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,820
Exactly.

298
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:18,160
The other thing is of course they were showing tech demos for the PS3, and of course they

299
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,960
They had the classic ducks in there and made a big joke about that, but it looked pretty

300
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,960
cool.

301
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,480
Some of the other demos I was actually pretty interested in, they had one showing a vehicle

302
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,660
physics and basically showed this really cool looking car get basically destroyed by a bunch

303
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:46,600
of bullets and all done incredibly accurate to just physics-wise, paint chipping and it's

304
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,600
just amazing.

305
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,660
Anyways, another game they showed, of course, Warhawk, which is one of the ones

306
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,280
I think that was actually an old Playstation game, if I remember correctly

307
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,960
Kind of an aerial combat game, almost like Twisted Metal, but for air

308
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,560
I don't think I've played an aerial combat game since Top Gun

309
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,480
on the NES, to be honest. Well, if I remember correctly, it was done by the same people

310
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,240
Which was awesome, don't get me wrong. It was done by the same people that did Twisted Metal

311
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,920
back on the original Playstation

312
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,560
and anyways, it is coming out now on the PS3 and will be

313
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,760
available to play at E3, so that's gonna be really cool.

314
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,880
And of course they also announced that

315
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,360
they're gonna have full PlayStation 2 support for the

316
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,520
PS3, and all the games are gonna be

317
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:32,160
upscaled to, you know, the 1080p or whatever.

318
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,600
I don't know, you know more about tech than I do.

319
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,280
Why is it, and maybe some of our listeners too, why is it that

320
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,240
it seems like Microsoft is having such a problem with backwards compatibility? I

321
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,840
I mean, only some things can be played, whereas PlayStation can do it easily.

322
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,960
Oh, isn't it the graphics thing?

323
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:55,360
Yes, because that's to emulate the other graphics chip, whereas this is the same graphics chip

324
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,240
or same family of graphics chips.

325
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,500
That's why they can run it perfectly.

326
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,480
That's a bummer because I think that's a pretty big selling point for Sony.

327
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,120
That's too bad for Microsoft.

328
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,980
Oh, well.

329
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,980
Let's see.

330
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,980
What else was being shown here?

331
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:16,060
So, of course, they were talking about the PlayStation Network platform, their brand

332
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,620
new online service that's going to...

333
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,340
That's not what they're really going to call it though, right?

334
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,340
That's just like a working name?

335
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,500
It's just the internal name for it right now.

336
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:27,100
They're going to have shops that sell online content, just like Xbox Live.

337
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:33,780
You can download to the PS3 hard drive, which is supposed to be included with it, and also

338
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:39,020
game applications can launch from the hard drive, so no disk required.

339
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:43,380
course just you know micropayments and stuff basically if it's on Xbox Live you're going

340
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,380
to probably see it on this.

341
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:48,520
Yeah the advantages to launching your console a year after one of your biggest competitors

342
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,540
is that you can basically copy everything that they did and that sounds like what they're

343
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,220
doing with their setup.

344
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:58,220
The other thing that they were doing with it a little bit differently, one they're not

345
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:03,540
going to be a central server for the games but all the other companies are going to be

346
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:07,780
running their external servers but this one you'll log into and it'll be kind of like

347
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,980
Like a hub for all these other ones.

348
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:17,300
The other thing that they did have, which was interesting, is the shops for each game

349
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:23,060
is actually going to be themed for each game, so you can buy tracks and stuff for certain

350
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,060
games.

351
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,060
Which I think is a good idea.

352
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:28,140
They do that with Ridge Racer 6, where you can purchase cars and music and stuff, and

353
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,300
I think that's a great idea, especially since the car purchases are free.

354
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,940
Purchasing games, possibility?

355
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,940
Like Playstation 1 games?

356
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:38,020
We have a comment from our chat room over at orangelanatrader.com, click on chat and

357
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:42,300
I'm watching you guys over in chat room, hello to our faithful chatters.

358
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,220
Rene says, I want Intelligent Cube to be downloadable and no more than $10.

359
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:52,540
Well, you have to pay like $70 if you want to find a legit copy of that game.

360
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,780
That could be, because if you think about it, they're going to have the Playstation

361
00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:00,240
1 emulator for the PSP, the official one, and that's something that they're talking

362
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,260
about doing digitally downloading these games, the older games.

363
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,880
So yeah, of course they're going to probably do something like that.

364
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,760
That's where they're kind of trying to push anyways.

365
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:15,520
One other thing though they're mentioning about the cell processors that has seven SPUs,

366
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:23,240
physics, collation, bot navigation, AI, and they can all be processed separately.

367
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:28,400
Actually if you've seen some of the games that they're showing for this, they look graphically,

368
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:34,000
look pretty close to the 360, if not better, but what's really interesting is the physics

369
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
behind some of the games that they're showing, like some of the middleware demos.

370
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,880
Just amazing.

371
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,840
I really think they're going to be pushing...

372
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:47,960
Well, I don't know, and I honestly don't remember a lot about the launches of PlayStation 2

373
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,400
and PlayStation, because I was more following that stuff casually, because we weren't doing

374
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,040
this back then.

375
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:57,240
I noticed that when consoles first come out,

376
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,520
the games are never as graphically powerful as they can be towards the end

377
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,480
of the console's run.

378
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,880
So to say the games look better than Xbox 360, well for now,

379
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,560
right? I mean, couldn't Xbox 360 come out with a more graphically

380
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,000
enhanced game later in its life? Yeah, but

381
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,440
I don't know if it has the processing power, I think. I don't know, we'll see.

382
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,920
Finally, the last thing they kind of

383
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:24,300
touched on which is interesting is SingStar, which for those who might not know, it's actually

384
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:28,300
a karaoke game that's really popular in the UK.

385
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,440
They're bringing it over here, it's going to be on next gen, which I don't know how

386
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,660
you can really improve a singing game that much, but it should be interesting.

387
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:40,400
I'm kind of surprised with Karaoke Revolution's success, it's kind of odd that we have that

388
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,800
here and they have SingStar over there, so yeah.

389
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,340
I think that was pretty much

390
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,860
everything. I might have missed a few things, but of course, you know, there was a lot

391
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,660
that they covered.

392
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:57,380
God of War 2, very interesting that they're choosing to go PlayStation 2 on

393
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,500
that. I suppose that shows their commitment to not

394
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,620
phase out the PlayStation 2 games for a little while, right?

395
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,740
That's right, yeah. Interesting. Okay.

396
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:09,740
Well, it sounds like Sony's got a lot on their plate there, so

397
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,860
very cool. What about Nintendo? Nintendo definitely...

398
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:17,860
We were all hoping they would be talking about the revolution, and they did, but the focus

399
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,940
was mainly on the DS.

400
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,860
The first thing, of course, they talked about was Brain Age, the brain training game that's

401
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:27,180
coming out in April, actually, and kind of different.

402
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:31,140
They were talking about how they pushed different types of games and how this has become a phenomenon

403
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:37,460
in Japan, just because it appeals to everybody, including older people that normally don't

404
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,660
play games.

405
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:43,280
And the development process for this, they actually showed how playing this game will

406
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,720
stimulate your brain in a way that will actually develop it a little bit, which I thought was

407
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,140
very interesting.

408
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:56,800
The other things they were talking about though, about the DS, just, I don't know, it looked

409
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:01,960
interesting but my focus of course was on the Revolution, which when they were talking

410
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,800
about that.

411
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:08,640
And you gotta love the Revolution, they're gonna have backwards compatibility, of course

412
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:15,120
talking about their virtual console, and everyone knew that it was going to be Nintendo, Super

413
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,860
Nintendo, Nintendo 64, and so on and so forth. What was interesting though is they mentioned

414
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:26,240
that Sega Genesis and TurboGrafx-16 titles will also be playable on there as well, which

415
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,880
is really cool. Of course, on the DS front there, they did mention a brand new Zelda

416
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:37,340
game on the DS, Zelda The Phantom Hourglass, and of course would be using the touchscreen

417
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:51,340
for a bunch of different puzzles as well as kind of like, I don't know if you remember the old Batman Returns movie or whatever, but where Batman actually programmed into his bat-rang where it would fly.

418
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:57,340
Well it's kind of a similar thing with the boomerang, you know you draw a path for the boomerang and it will fly with that.

419
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:01,400
Just really cool, kind of combining the look of

420
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:05,160
Zelda Wind Waker and some of the

421
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:09,680
Minish Cap stuff.

422
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,180
You know, I don't think I should really be surprised. I noticed a lot of

423
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:16,840
people were really surprised, like OMG, a Zelda game on the DS, but

424
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,960
at the same time it kind of seems pretty logical, doesn't it?

425
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,020
My reaction to that when I read the news was like,

426
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:26,580
oh yeah, it is about time for a Zelda game on the DS. We

427
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,140
we haven't really had one yet.

428
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,000
Like that was kind of my reaction to the news was like,

429
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,500
oh yeah, yeah, I wonder when they are gonna be doing that.

430
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,420
So it was kind of cool to see though,

431
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:38,260
and see that they're gonna go with the Wind Waker-style

432
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,820
look for the DS game, kind of should be interesting.

433
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,740
I do not think that is cool at all.

434
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,880
Really, just because you don't like the Wind Waker look?

435
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,060
I didn't like, I thought that it was,

436
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,840
I never did like that type of art style.

437
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,920
I thought that it looked very poorly done.

438
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:59,440
I didn't think, it was like trying to be stylistic, but it looked really

439
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,480
just like a five-year-old drew it.

440
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,680
For me, it's the kind of look that should have been on the DS and only on the DS.

441
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,600
Like, it kind of should have been the portable look and not the GameCube one.

442
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,040
I think it shouldn't have been a look at all.

443
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,000
Well, I have to agree to disagree on that one.

444
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,360
Anything else? Interesting? Yeah, some of the other things, they were talking about

445
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,800
kind of creating a video game version of Apple's iTunes, you know, but for video

446
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,400
games, kind of like a service for that.

447
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,400
Which makes sense.

448
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:32,520
Yeah, you know what, I think that's huge because I think a lot of people have been assuming

449
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:37,160
that if you buy a revolution, you're going to get to play all these backwards games for

450
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,160
free.

451
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,160
No.

452
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,480
Obviously, if there's money to still be made off the old library, you're going to get charged

453
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,480
for it.

454
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,560
And especially I think showing Sega and Hudson coming online for this, I think only kind

455
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,940
of further proves this theory that you're going to have to pay for this because I don't

456
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:56,020
see them signing these agreements to make it all free.

457
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,660
So I think you are going to see something very similar to the iTunes store where you

458
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:04,560
pay like a dollar to play the game, maybe a dollar fifty to maybe even up to five dollars

459
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,860
for some of the titles when we start getting into the later generations.

460
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:12,040
Who knows, of course that's all estimates, I mean who knows.

461
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:16,060
Maybe you get a couple of them for free, I mean just to kind of show how it works.

462
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:19,220
Like you know iTunes does a free song once in a while so maybe they would do something

463
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:24,040
like that, but I think for most of it you're going to have to pay for the good stuff.

464
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,120
But to some people it's going to be worth it.

465
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,540
It's a way of legalizing the ROM thing.

466
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:34,720
I'm sure the industry has been wanting forever to squelch the ROM scene that goes on underground

467
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:41,880
on the internet, so maybe this is their way to do it and show that there is a legal outlet

468
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,160
for this and if they wanted to maybe take legal action against ROM stuff, I don't know.

469
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,960
I'm theorizing here.

470
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,280
Yeah, I don't know.

471
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,200
The other thing I was interested in is, of course,

472
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,860
you know, everyone's thinking, okay, they're going to drop the bomb on like, you know, some big,

473
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,840
you know, the revolution being

474
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,400
VR type thing.

475
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,880
That's been the rumor, everyone's thinking that.

476
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,680
And of course, that didn't happen.

477
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:12,840
Well, that's because they're waiting for E3, and there's, he said, he's all, I've got, you know,

478
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,800
You know, this is going to be... there's still

479
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,880
another major announcement. You're still convinced on the... I'm still convinced!

480
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,400
...on the stereoscopic 3D thing, aren't you? I'm still convinced.

481
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,280
I know it's out there.

482
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,480
And there was actually a thing on,

483
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,600
what was it, Holoprojection. There was another device that they were showing.

484
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,680
I don't remember where I read that on.

485
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,020
Not necessarily for Nintendo, but for something else.

486
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,740
they're showing that so I know technologies out there I know it's gonna

487
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,380
happen

488
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,580
you know we knew they were good you knew they were gonna say anything GDC

489
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:51,220
here's the thing, the whole theme of it is disrupting

490
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:55,620
gaming disruptive gaming is what it is called and it's basically a technique where

491
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,460
you

492
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:01,380
drop like you make a big splash in the water is basically the way it works

493
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:06,180
and what's gonna happen at E3 you're gonna get a lot of information that you haven't

494
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:06,900
heard yet

495
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:10,500
and it's just gonna be like wow it's kind of like you know just

496
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,300
finishing off somebody you know real quick you know the one-two punch and then

497
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,780
well the companies are doing this so they can't steal from each other

498
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,900
I would be essentially is so that Nintendo when they announces E3 it'll be

499
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,540
too late for Sony to copy it in time for their launch

500
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:25,860
and same thing with whatever bombs Sony ends up dropping same thing for Nintendo

501
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,580
and Microsoft

502
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:30,280
that puts Microsoft in kind of a funky position not that mean but they could

503
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,980
have secrets to that they're gonna unveil at E3 you know so

504
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:38,780
But at E3 you've got the world media there. I mean, GDC, while it's important,

505
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,980
doesn't quite have that same attention factor

506
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:46,700
that E3 does. You know what I mean? Publicists, media people from around the

507
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,020
world go to E3.

508
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:52,020
Everybody is watching. GDC, the hardcore gamers are watching.

509
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:56,900
So I'm still confident because we haven't heard no yet.

510
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:00,860
So I'm confident that, you know,

511
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:04,580
there's gotta be more to it because we haven't seen really any of the demos yet

512
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,060
or sent

513
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:09,520
this I don't know at I think is gonna happen we'll see six weeks to find out

514
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,640
six weeks member basically of course the big theme

515
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,200
which everybody you know you gotta love um you wanna

516
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,240
some theme is basically video games are meant to be just one thing

517
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:25,460
fun fun for everybody well let's hope he means it

518
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:29,100
but you know based on Nintendo's track record there they're pretty good about

519
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,380
keeping it with the fun so

520
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:34,460
Moving on, Microsoft. Now, Microsoft's in the position where they already have a

521
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:37,460
system out there, so what kind of stuff were they pushing at GDC?

522
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:41,580
They were talking, of course, about the Xbox Live Arcade and

523
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,500
kind of the stuff that's coming out for that. And just basically, you know,

524
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,220
concentrating on Xbox Live, they

525
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:51,620
released basically a framework for anybody to be able to

526
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:55,020
kind of build a back-end to

527
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:59,220
the live service, you know, making it more approachable for

528
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:04,820
MMOs to be able to be on live. The other thing that they were talking about some of the downloads

529
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:09,260
coming out for some of the Microsoft first party games like Project Gotham, you're going

530
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:15,980
to see more cars, more tracks. Cameo, you're going to see co-op play over live, as well

531
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:22,860
as more outfits, whoopity do. Actually they were already talking about Perfect Dark, which

532
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:26,660
is going to have more multiplayer maps in Oblivion, which I thought was interesting.

533
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:33,660
the first pack is going to be a horse armor pack, so yeah, and also of course talking

534
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:41,500
about the games coming out, you know, Streetfire 2, was it Hoop World I think is one of the

535
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:46,120
big ones coming out, and there was going to be one of the first games using the Unreal

536
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:51,720
3 engine is actually going to be hitting Xbox Live, which I thought was interesting. Very

537
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,720
Very cool.

538
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,400
Oh, and the webcam, of course.

539
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,400
Oh, right.

540
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:00,200
One of the things, of course, we've kind of talked about the webcam a little bit before.

541
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:05,960
Basically, you know, something that looks kind of like a webcam or eye toy.

542
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:13,060
What's interesting, though, is it's going to have gesture recognition, so I guess the

543
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,060
camera is going to...

544
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:17,560
So, like, if I stick up my middle finger at the game, it'll know, and it'll go, that's

545
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,560
not nice.

546
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,520
well i'm not sure exactly what that is but uh...

547
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:25,760
gesture recognition but i guess you know um...

548
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,660
if you're frowning or something i don't know maybe

549
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:33,240
maybe if that way if i moon the camera will my xbox go oh god

550
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,880
maybe if like they eventually port over world of warcraft to the 360 you'll see

551
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,120
if you look suicidal so they can call the authorities wait a minute though

552
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,280
they they said not going to happen on world of warcraft on xbox 360

553
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,240
here's why but see blizzard says it's not going to happen based on the framework

554
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,880
work that they have right now it doesn't it doesn't make it easy for them to do

555
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:57,040
it but now that they've done this and kind of changed you know the way life

556
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:04,280
works it could happen or it might happen I really don't care but yeah a comment

557
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:08,800
from the chat room rainy again sky what if you're aroused like what it would it

558
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,600
sense that and then call somebody to come over and no I'm just teasing

559
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,560
special help I like

560
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:21,520
I like the emo sensor comment

561
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,640
what I do like about it though is it will be able to take high def still

562
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,400
pictures

563
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:29,200
which is pretty cool um so 1280 by 980

564
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,800
so 1.3 megapixels would we be able to take a webcam like that put it in here

565
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,760
and like broadcast over xbox live

566
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,800
in a way yes huh now that might be kinda trippy

567
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:44,160
Check that out. It says smooth near DV quality video up to

568
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:47,360
VGA 640 by 480 at 30 frames per second.

569
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:51,880
In a sense we could probably do that, which would be interesting.

570
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:55,400
Then digital zoom cropping.

571
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:59,040
It's also going to have a 9 foot USB cable which is awesome.

572
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,960
I hate having to strap more USB cables to it.

573
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,840
Alright, sounds very cool. Lots of good stuff there coming out of Game Developers

574
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,920
Conference. Lots more

575
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,280
in six weeks at E3. Like I said, I think I said this last week on the show,

576
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,480
on the show, GDC is kinda like that tease.

577
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,320
Here's a little taste, here's a little bit of crack, we'll give you some more

578
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,920
when you come back in six weeks for E3.

579
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,000
Alright, let's move on and get into some other news. There was lots of

580
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,080
other news that happened

581
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,720
at GDC and kind of around GDC, so let's get into some of that.

582
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,680
Last week I was talking about Final Fantasy XI and there's a lot of

583
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,080
expansions coming to that.

584
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:37,000
Oh yeah, I didn't even mention during my gaming week. I'm at level 12 on my new

585
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,120
character on Final Fantasy XI.

586
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,120
Addict.

587
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,120
Thank you.

588
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,120
I was waiting for that.

589
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,120
All right.

590
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,120
Let's see.

591
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:49,060
Square Enix revealed a little bit of its new chocobo circuit feature, and basically the

592
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:53,600
way that you raise your bird in the game will determine its size and its shape and ultimately

593
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,720
the stats.

594
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,520
So I think that's awesome, because I want to have a fat chocobo, because fat chocobo

595
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,520
is the best.

596
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,520
Yes, it was.

597
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,840
Smells like chocobo.

598
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,840
Remember?

599
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,840
All right.

600
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,160
So I want a fat chocobo.

601
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:09,980
By introducing your chocobo to somebody else's bird, if they are compatible and of the opposite

602
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:13,780
sex, you might be able to breed more chocobos.

603
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,780
No gay chocobo loving here.

604
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:23,100
Well, I think the fallback for that is that you can't make babies in a homosexual relationship,

605
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:30,020
not without test tubes and things that don't exist in the final fantasy world and donors.

606
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,620
There are still things that are not answered yet.

607
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,520
Are you going to keep the chocobo?

608
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,840
Will it be in the mogg house maybe?

609
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,680
How often can you do the breeding?

610
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,440
Can you sell the chocobos?

611
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,640
Can you trade them?

612
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:45,780
Are you going to be able to ride your own chocobo around the world?

613
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,780
Can you eat them?

614
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,440
Can you spank them when they're naughty?

615
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,120
My chocobo was a naughty bunny.

616
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,480
Can you cook them and eat them?

617
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,480
How rude.

618
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,480
That would be awesome.

619
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,400
I can have Kentucky Fried Chocobo.

620
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,320
Can the chocobos attack the bunnies?

621
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:05,800
Once and for all, let's get rid of all those damn bunnies, like the Uber bunnies and Bribumu

622
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,400
or whatever that land is where the level 70 bunnies are.

623
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,720
Do you have to take your Chocobo for a walk and do you have to clean up after it?

624
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:18,800
Is Chocobo Poo used as a flame agent when you're making stuff?

625
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,800
Well here's the deal.

626
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,120
The Chocobo Circuit is not going to go live until later this year.

627
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,360
It's going to be a patch that rolls out in the fall.

628
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:30,800
However, you'll have a good four months or so to breed because the expansion will do

629
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,800
that.

630
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,200
That's just the racing, of course, right?

631
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:38,500
Right, that's the racing, a la Final Fantasy VII, which people have been begging for years.

632
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,280
That's going to breathe a lot of life back into Final Fantasy XI, I think, because I

633
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:48,480
noticed the game is emptier now than it was six months ago or whenever I quit the first

634
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,480
time.

635
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,480
You know what?

636
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,280
I still like the Peko Peko versus the Chocobo.

637
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,280
Pimp my Chocobo?

638
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,920
Because the Peko Peko looks like a giant turkey.

639
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:03,720
We gotta bling out this chocobo, we're gonna put an all bass sound system up its ass.

640
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,040
You Final Fantasy people and your chocobos.

641
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:11,840
Alright, look, all we need is if they do a third expansion, then we need Pimp My Moogle,

642
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,840
Pimp My Moghouse.

643
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,840
I mean, you can kinda do the Moghouse.

644
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,840
You already pimp your Moghouse.

645
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,840
Yeah, but it sucks.

646
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,920
I mean, there's not a lot you do with it.

647
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,920
I had a plant in my Moghouse in a bed.

648
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,240
There's not really a lot you do with the Moghouse, but everybody's Moogle looks the same.

649
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,280
I want a fat chocobo and I want a fat moogle.

650
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,440
I want my moogle to dance. I want Mog dance.

651
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,200
Exactly. And we need a dancer. We need that to be a character.

652
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,560
Somebody in- We have dancers in Ragnarok, oooh.

653
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,560
Somebody in-game the other day was trying to, like, sell me up and down that

654
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:41,440
Geomancer is this unannounced fourth character that's going to be in the

655
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,920
expansion. I'm kinda like,

656
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,920
uh, dude, I think they would have announced it by now. I don't know.

657
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,880
Take that with a grain of salt.

658
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,920
Let's see. Comments from the chat room.

659
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:55,640
Let's see, Fireboma says it would actually be more like a Valis fried

660
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,520
chocobo,

661
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:00,120
not Kentucky fried chocobo, just so you know.

662
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:04,520
That came from VGCats, Kentucky Ferraga chocobo.

663
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:09,040
Gotcha. Rainy says, can the fucking chocobo fly a la Final Fantasy

664
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,680
9? Even in the older Final Fantasies, if you had a black chocobo, it could fly.

665
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:19,280
Thoughts there? Let's see, Spirit Snare says if a chocobo ate a

666
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:28,160
chicken, would that be considered cannibalism? I don't know. Anyway, let's go to the next

667
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,560
story, which is also Final Fantasy XI related, correct, Loki?

668
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:38,000
That's correct. If you've been playing the Final Fantasy XI beta on the 360, well, you've

669
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,800
got about until April 2nd, before you gotta pony up the cash. Because Final Fantasy XI

670
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:52,380
actually coming out on the 17th which is pretty cool both the expansion and the 360 version

671
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:56,060
so if you own the Playstation 2 one you can get the expansion and I think the PC expansion

672
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:01,580
comes out around the same time. However though if you have been playing in the beta for the

673
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:06,540
360 you can transfer your character over so all that hard work is for Nott. I don't know

674
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:12,140
if I want to get Final Fantasy 11 on the 360 anymore because I just I got a little bit

675
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:16,460
of a bonus at work so I went and I bought some more RAM for the PC and so

676
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:19,780
now I have two gigs of RAM in this PC and Final Fantasy 11 I don't have frame

677
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:24,200
rate issues anymore so it's kind of nice so and plus editing the show will go so

678
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:28,700
much faster now which makes me happy so we'll see I I do there's still something

679
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:32,020
to be said though about being able to plop my fat ass on the couch and playing

680
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:35,900
with the controller and everything like you know in my lap laying back you know

681
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:40,080
having a drink that I can't really do in this little stuffy office that we have

682
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:46,800
with the computer so yeah the only thing you really do if you are gonna go out

683
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:53,040
and buy the through the 360 version of Final Fantasy 11 please pick up a mouse

684
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:59,560
and keyboard yes I agree it's it's it's impossible to party without it I mean

685
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:04,040
it's not I shouldn't say it's not impossible but everybody will hate you

686
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:08,640
sorry to say unless you unless you spend some serious time coming up with some

687
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:14,880
kick-ass macros you are screwed they do have however voice chat in the 360

688
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,480
version no they don't they said they weren't gonna do that no they do except

689
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,160
it's not exactly user friendly and you have to kind of find your friend and you

690
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:28,280
can only chat via you know your oh via the in-game chat or the I'm sorry in

691
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:32,480
like the Xbox 360 global chat thing right yeah okay still though I mean

692
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,440
that's pretty cool I mean I guess that's true if I add friends in link shell that

693
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:40,880
outside 360, I suppose that might be cool for a little bit, because Final Fantasy 11

694
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,060
is usually a social thing anyway, that's how I kind of figure, I have some friends online

695
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,920
that I pretty much only see there, I don't talk to them on AOL, it's a messenger, so

696
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:55,200
anyway, let's move over to another MMO that's teaching us some good real life lessons, yes

697
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,200
Dark Sakura?

698
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:03,760
Well, it's been shown that World of Warcraft actually has taught a lesson to a certain

699
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:11,480
man, Joy Ito, who is a blogger, a big gamer in Japan, and he also thinks that World of

700
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:18,340
Warcraft offers lots of business lessons for how to make companies work better.

701
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:24,800
Basically his idea with this, the point was that employers do better, they need to make

702
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,880
sure that they keep their employees happy by being respectful to them and encouraging

703
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,980
them to work together to find their common goals without the leaders just pointing out

704
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:36,320
the rules without saying, you have to do it this way, you have to do it this way, I'm

705
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,560
going to micromanage you to death.

706
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:44,440
By giving their people unpleasant tasks and raids and pointing out, you know, you do this,

707
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:49,600
we've got something for you, just do it how you need to do it.

708
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:54,840
That's interesting because those endgame guilds and stuff can really be like a job sometimes.

709
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:58,700
Not that I've been addicted to the game enough to actually get into one, but I've heard

710
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:04,000
about that, you know, there's like expectations that sound like harsher expectations at my

711
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,940
job like, you know, in these end game guilds you must show up on certain nights a week

712
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:12,700
and you have to perform these functions and you will be doing this in the raid or you're

713
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:13,740
kicked out of the guild.

714
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:14,740
You're fired, you know?

715
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:18,820
Well what he's saying is that with the nature of the game because it forces people to work

716
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:24,540
together to reach your goals, that it parallels how you need in your business to work together

717
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:25,540
to reach your goals.

718
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:32,640
And even myself and the team, the job function that I do, I fully see that my job touches

719
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,560
so many other people's jobs that if we don't work together, it won't get done.

720
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,640
So there's a lot of parallels with that.

721
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,740
This guy is really successful.

722
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:46,680
He's considered to be a very good leader in business.

723
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,920
There's got to be something to it.

724
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,840
And I think that lots more places need to listen up, pay attention, install some MMOs

725
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,000
on those computers at work.

726
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,440
I always find it fascinating these stories that come up about

727
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,460
real-life lessons learned in MMOs, but you know, even by just

728
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:04,420
like when I was looking at our outline for tonight, I always just looked at the

729
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,300
outline, I was thinking, you know, you could

730
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,540
maybe like auction house and the whole bartering thing does teach you a lesson

731
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,320
about like, you know, economics

732
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:15,380
in a way. Well, especially, you know, these whole,

733
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:19,700
for example, I learned a lot. You actually learned a little bit about business and

734
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,260
marketing in Ragnarok.

735
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:26,700
Yeah, because this was my thing. I played a merchant for a long time on Ragnarok Online,

736
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:34,060
I would take my warps to Komodo, go buy my Iron Arrows at my discount, go back and sell them for

737
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:39,260
three times the price, but I also had to, when I figured in that price, I would figure in how much

738
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:43,900
does it cost for me to warp there, how much is it gonna, you know, what is my profit margin going

739
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:47,260
to be? Yeah, you learn, you learn a lot about, like in Final Fantasy XI it was the same thing

740
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:52,220
Something with like auction house versus NPCs, you learn a lot about supply and demand.

741
00:44:52,220 --> 00:45:00,180
One money making trick I have been using right now is that I noticed is very similar.

742
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:05,780
If you go to a certain NPC, you can buy a certain piece of armor for about 1000 gil.

743
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:09,780
It sells to the auction house for 8000 gil, so you can kind of buy it there and some people

744
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:13,960
go, �Oh, that�s wrong, that�s wrong,� but at the same time, well, okay, they could

745
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:24,920
When you buy a game, an imported Japanese game, you're paying extra because they brought

746
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,920
it in for you.

747
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:26,920
It's fascinating.

748
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:27,920
Here's how it works.

749
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,880
For example, soda, a fountain drink.

750
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,400
When you buy a fountain drink, do you know how much the syrup you use costs?

751
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,400
Like three cents.

752
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,400
Three cents.

753
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,400
Do you know how much you're paying for your soda?

754
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,400
About two dollars.

755
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,400
At the movie theater?

756
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,400
A lot.

757
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,400
That's how they make all their money.

758
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,400
Even at a restaurant.

759
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,400
It's the same thing.

760
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:47,960
actually selling the arrows for as much as a person would normally buy them in-game.

761
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:52,240
If they took the time to go to Komodo to buy it, but instead I bring it to them, charge

762
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,800
them the same price, they think they're getting the better end of the deal when in fact I'm

763
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:00,880
making double profit because merchants have discount.

764
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,480
See, if MMOs had been around when I was learning economy in high school, I would have done

765
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,480
so much better.

766
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,880
You know what we did in my economics class?

767
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,580
We played the stock market.

768
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:11,680
I don't even remember my economics class.

769
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,680
I remember sleeping.

770
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,960
We invested in Intel and a morgue.

771
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,640
I cheated.

772
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,720
I was friends with this girl.

773
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,040
We were both kind of outcasts.

774
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,040
We were nerdy kids.

775
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,360
I was friends with this girl in economics class.

776
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:27,280
We just kind of talked the whole way through.

777
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,880
I picked a funeral home because people are dying to get in.

778
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,880
Boo!

779
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:32,880
Boo!

780
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:33,880
No, no, no.

781
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:39,240
That was my logic and my classmates agreed with me and that was actually one of our faster

782
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,240
moving stocks.

783
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:46,160
We played the stock exchange thing, too, and I spent all my money on a stock that was one

784
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:52,680
sixty-fourth of a cent, and it doubled in price, and so I made twice my money.

785
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:55,440
Good job.

786
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:59,360
Moving on from economics lessons, let's learn about legal lessons that can also be

787
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:03,120
learned in World of Warcraft.

788
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:08,680
Basically what's going on is that Blizzard asked this guy on eBay to stop selling this

789
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:11,220
unofficial guide.

790
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:15,100
The guy that was selling the guide was a 24-year-old Brian Kopp of Bronson, Florida.

791
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:20,840
He was selling the ultimate World of Warcraft leveling and gold guide on eBay and it was

792
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,560
basically his own guide that he put together.

793
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:28,720
Well, it was unauthorized, so Blizzard basically sent the smackdown.

794
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:36,560
They filed a complaint and they are basically saying to this kid, don't do this.

795
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:42,240
Well, he's not taking this without fighting back, and he actually filed this week in a

796
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:48,320
California federal court, and he's alleging that they were wrong in ordering this termination.

797
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:52,400
The companies were saying, you're violating copyright, you're violating trademark, and

798
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,300
this guy is saying that, hey, my book doesn't infringe on any of this.

799
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:00,280
It presents a disclaimer on the first page that it's unauthorized.

800
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:04,100
It contains no text, no storylines from the games.

801
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:08,900
It's fair use of the screenshots under copyright law, and this guy's really standing up for

802
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:09,900
himself.

803
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:10,900
What do you think, though?

804
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:11,900
Good for him.

805
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:15,180
But do you think, I mean, while it's, you know, while it's human nature we want to cheer

806
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:19,580
the underdog on, is it right for him to be selling these on our authorized guides on

807
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:20,580
eBay?

808
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:23,900
I don't think that it was right for him to necessarily use the screenshots, because the

809
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:28,500
only time that you can really use, and I recently looked this up due to me winning an argument

810
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:34,680
on DDR Freak fair use you have to there just to go ahead and give a slight

811
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:40,440
overview to it you have to either edit the picture to some extent or you can

812
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:47,480
use copyrighted material in like reproduction for news for education but

813
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:53,200
this I wouldn't necessarily qualifies under education it more qualifies under

814
00:48:53,200 --> 00:49:01,040
entertainment. If he were doing, like say he was writing an editorial on World of

815
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,440
Warcraft, then yeah he'd be able to use quotes from the game, he'd be able to use

816
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,360
screenshots, because that follows under fair use. So I think that's probably

817
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,880
where the judge is gonna have to make the determination, is what does this

818
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:14,920
qualify as? I think he would be able to continue with his work, but he couldn't

819
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:19,320
use the screenshots. Especially that in particular. Basically it just sounds

820
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,760
like he's written an overblown FAQ.

821
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,420
And so if Blizzard was going to have a problem with that, they would have been shutting down

822
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,000
all the FAQs up on GameFAQs.

823
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Right, no, I think their problem is, well, GameFAQs doesn't, well, I guess that's right,

824
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,400
GameFAQs does make money off their advertising and stuff, but it's a little bit of a, they

825
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,280
walk a fine line too, because they're really not making money off the games.

826
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:43,240
The information they present is owned by the people who presented it.

827
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,700
They just host it.

828
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:51,160
Therefore they are not claiming ownership to the material, they did not produce any

829
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,160
of the information.

830
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:58,580
It was individual people that produced the information, so they are perfectly fine.

831
00:49:58,580 --> 00:49:59,960
Very interesting.

832
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,300
Another life lesson to be learned here.

833
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:06,500
So I guess we will see what happens, at least whoever is right or wrong, we don't know really,

834
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:11,540
but I think it is good that this guy is sticking up for himself and what he believes in and

835
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:15,040
is gonna fight this and doesn't you know just take it like I think a lot of

836
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:20,060
people would so good for him and best of luck to him we'll see what happens we'll

837
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:25,780
follow this story and let you know what happens moving on let's go over to Loki

838
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:30,020
very interesting punishment in another MMO that I had never heard about until

839
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:36,100
this week right yes you know I always thought what's my MMO missing and that

840
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:40,660
That would be crucifixion, definitely crucifixion.

841
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:46,500
But actually, if you are playing the online game Roma Victor, which is an online recreation

842
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:53,840
of Britain in the Roman times, basically you live your lives as slaves or citizens of the

843
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,140
all-conquering empire.

844
00:50:56,140 --> 00:51:02,940
However, if you do happen to break some of the rules, you'll be nailed to a cross as

845
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:05,460
punishment.

846
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:08,340
That's historically accurate though.

847
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:09,340
Did you see the pictures?

848
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:11,820
There were actually pictures on the internet of this.

849
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:16,740
They actually showed the guy and all these people in game standing around the cross and

850
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:21,340
there's this sad little man on there just kind of hanging there and everybody's just

851
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:22,500
kind of talking about it.

852
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,500
I know.

853
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:26,900
I think that there's of course a definite potential there for people to get their panties

854
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:30,260
all in a bunch and go, oh, that's sacrilegious.

855
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:31,260
Well but you're playing it historically.

856
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:32,260
It's historically accurate.

857
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:45,260
Yeah, I mean, you're gonna play an MMO that's historically accurate and that kind of, if I'm not mistaken, this game kind of, it's big marketing niche is that, you know, be in the historically accurate Roman times, right? So, I mean...

858
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:49,260
We're gonna be historically accurate, but we're gonna leave out how they kill people.

859
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:51,260
No, I don't think they're gonna, well, obviously they're not, but...

860
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:55,260
Well, I mean, but I think that we're gonna get the, oh, you have to get out of the game, blah, blah, blah...

861
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:59,260
No, people would be stupid to get their panties in a bunch over this. If you wanna, if you wanna play...

862
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:00,260
But people are stupid.

863
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:04,060
If you want to play an online game that's, you know, cute, and play something on the

864
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:10,140
DS that's, you know, very colorful and friendly, don't play, you know, Emulation of Ancient

865
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:11,140
Rome.

866
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:12,140
I mean, come on.

867
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:15,220
Well, what I mean is that there are these people there who are just that stupid, who

868
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:17,620
are gonna say something about it.

869
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:18,620
You know, we've already...

870
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:19,620
There we go.

871
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:20,620
There's a shot.

872
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:21,620
There we go.

873
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:22,620
That is so neat.

874
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:24,180
It's just kind of...

875
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:29,820
Well, no, I think it's, you know, being that I love studying history, I think that's really

876
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:35,820
It's certainly creative, and I give the creators of this game a lot of credit for thinking of this out-of-the-box punishment,

877
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:41,820
because like I said, I never heard of this game until this story went all out on all these blogs and stuff this week,

878
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:45,820
and now it's like, hmm, I didn't know there was a game like this, maybe I'll have to check it out sometime,

879
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:48,820
and their membership will probably double, thanks to this.

880
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:53,820
If they did a medieval game, I'd want to see people drawn and quartered. Same difference.

881
00:52:53,820 --> 00:53:00,820
You just want death the MMO. You want faces of death the MMO or something that's disgusting.

882
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:07,820
No, no, no, no, no. I want like... I have my MMO.

883
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:11,820
Comments from the chat room. Legend of Zaku says, the passion of the MMORPG.

884
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:13,820
A little play on something else.

885
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:21,820
I love the screenshots here. This one's like, Vondum says, no throwing dung, it's too expensive, use apples, they are cheaper.

886
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:27,500
Alright, let's go to another story and

887
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:31,660
this might actually have to do a little bit with crucifixion too because if you

888
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:32,720
send us letters

889
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:36,540
and they're really bad, DarkSakura will crucify you verbally

890
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:40,700
for the... no I'm kidding, she's the sweetest pie, she's the sweetest those

891
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,540
apples in that MMO that people are tossing

892
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:46,300
and she's going to read your emails and she'll choose some of her favorites and

893
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:48,440
read them live on air so that Loki and I can

894
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:52,040
respond to them as well. Correct, DarkSakura?

895
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:56,760
Possibly. Alright, so let's open up the mailbag. mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com

896
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:57,880
if you want to drop us an email

897
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:01,400
and let's see what DarkSakura digs up for us this week.

898
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:07,560
Well, my first one is actually from our long-time listener DJ Rama S.

899
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:10,400
Aw, I love Rama S.

900
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,440
I'll just go ahead and read a little bit of this.

901
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:17,480
Hey guys, the podcast has been keeping my sanity from Wednesday to Friday as I made my way

902
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:24,480
to and from jury duty. Anywho, the purpose of this email is to clarify the Tetris issue.

903
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,400
From what I remember, Bulletproof Software owned the rights to Tetris after Nintendo

904
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:33,360
released it for the NES. The Tengen Virtus, which is the best version in my humble opinion,

905
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:38,060
was illegally obtained and through lawsuits Nintendo won, the Tengen version was deemed

906
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:44,060
illegal and to this day is considered a pretty penny if you can get your hands on it, which

907
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:45,960
I got mine like for $12.

908
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:50,020
You know what, I disagree on Tengen Tetris being this like, I think it's a little bit

909
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:52,740
overrated just because it is such a collector's item.

910
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:53,740
I don't think it's as great.

911
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:55,440
Tengen Tetris had co-op mode.

912
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:00,660
It did, but you know, I just, it's still- I'm reading this letter.

913
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,720
Alright, I'm fine, sorry.

914
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:06,240
And I'm interjecting my opinion, that's what I do here.

915
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:10,120
After that, the rights went to another company called Blue Planet Software, and they were

916
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:14,760
responsible for PC ports and licensing for a while and then it became the Tetris company.

917
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:19,240
And from what I know now, Nintendo licenses Tetris and any variants from them now.

918
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,600
I hope that clears things up somewhat.

919
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,000
That absolutely clears things up.

920
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,200
And he also agrees with Loki about Datel, that their products are shit.

921
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,560
Alright, thank you for clarifying the Tetris thing.

922
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,560
I didn't know.

923
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:34,240
All I can tell you is that the one that came out on PlayStation 1 that was even in their

924
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,360
best hits collection was shit.

925
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,500
I hated it.

926
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,040
It's an awful rendition of Tetris.

927
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:43,880
it like the plague. I know I'm about 10 years too late but avoid the PlayStation

928
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:50,360
One Tetris like the plague. It's awful. We have another email from Roger. So just

929
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:53,320
wanted to drop a note from a periodic listener. I'm very glad you guys switched

930
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:59,400
to the 64 Kbps stream format. It's so much easier on the ears now. I also like

931
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,320
that you've added a bit more variety to the mix and really hope you don't stray

932
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:05,800
too far from your Bimani roots. On the other hand, I got such a kick out of

933
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:09,640
hearing Pac-Man Fever the other day. I still have the LP of that laying around

934
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:10,640
around somewhere.

935
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:15,080
Yes, we have little bits of randomness in our live 24-hour station that plays the music

936
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:19,240
when we're not doing anything live, and I must say that it's been buffed up now with

937
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:24,340
even more video game music, but of course we will not stray from the Bahmani roots.

938
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:31,840
In fact, we have Beatmania 2DX 13th style, also really the real name is Beatmania 2DX

939
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:32,840
Distorted.

940
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:35,480
We have MP3s from that, we're going to be putting some of those in rotation this week,

941
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:36,480
so some new stuff.

942
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,440
There's a new rendition of Bloody Tears, that's pretty cool.

943
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,720
it's different it's really different don't don't expect it to sound like

944
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:48,560
what you know but anyway I've got another email from a psycho just it's

945
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:54,920
pretty long so just to go over and Tetris DS conclusion sexy we covered all

946
00:56:54,920 --> 00:57:00,440
of them agreed only complaint though extremely minor is that in online Wi-Fi

947
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:04,480
play the box of players get will be different so you might get stuck with a

948
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:09,280
crappy setup and other person will breeze through their blocks that's I did

949
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:13,520
notice that too is that the block order is not consistent which is I think is a

950
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:18,680
bit of a disadvantage but yeah it's also not the end of the world I you know what

951
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:22,240
I hate about online multiplayer and Tetris is that goddamn banana as oh

952
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:25,040
that's the most frustrating I it's like shuffle and tetranet oh it's the most

953
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:31,080
frustrating item um another one about a DDR supernova mm-hmm about chaos counted

954
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:37,640
no less than 43 stops on that song you know why it's it's one song out of like

955
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:40,840
what, 200 so I'm not gonna bitch too much but don't expect me to play that song.

956
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:41,840
Once you learn it, it's gonna be easy.

957
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,640
Yeah, but the problem with that song is it's gonna get

958
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:48,040
whored out because everybody's gonna learn it to show off

959
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:52,000
to the, you know, parents and kids at the arcade. I promise you right now I will not learn how to play it.

960
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,640
Alright, thank you. At least someone won't. I won't either. I will boycott that song.

961
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,760
I'm with ya. Let's boycott chaos. Boycott chaos. We're on.

962
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:04,120
And I'll make an edit to it. We'll play Toxic

963
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:07,240
over and over. No, just kidding. Alright, anyway.

964
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:13,600
Also, a question for us about the controller, wondering if the controllers are basically

965
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:14,600
going to be switchable?

966
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:15,600
Yeah.

967
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:16,600
Oh, for Beat Media?

968
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:17,600
Yeah, of course they will.

969
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:18,600
Yes, they will.

970
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:19,600
They're nice.

971
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:20,600
Next week?

972
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,240
The only difference is the rounded edge on the turntable side, but it's still flippable,

973
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,240
just like the old one.

974
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:28,080
We also have an email from David, says, hey guys, I think the shows are great, I love

975
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:31,440
the new format and I listen to you every week, I think it would be great though if you could

976
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,240
talk about some LucasArts games.

977
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:36,520
Also, are you sure that Sony is actually redesigning the PSP?

978
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:40,680
read an article on Slashdot that said the camera would only be an accessory. Would the

979
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:44,520
games that come out after the new PSP come out still work on the old PSP?

980
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:49,480
The camera is an accessory. It plugs into the USB port in the top. However, they are

981
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:55,400
still looking at redesigning the PSP to be released later in the fall. So...

982
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,400
How Nintendo does it, why can't Sony, right?

983
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,080
It's both. So, I mean, I guess that's good.

984
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:03,680
So old PSP owners aren't screwed out of the camera. If you want to get a camera, you can

985
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:04,680
still get a real PSP.

986
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:10,680
It's perfectly fine. I think the only thing they're really changing is just maybe making it a little bit slimmer and adding that hard drive in there.

987
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:16,680
And I don't even know how expensive that would be if there was a 4GB NAND flash drive in there.

988
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:23,680
Those memory sticks are pretty damn expensive. What, is this thing going to be like $300? Because I don't pay for that.

989
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:30,680
Favorite, just to humor this guy, even though LucasArts games are what, like 15, 20 years old? Favorite LucasArts game?

990
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:32,680
Didn't they do KOTOR?

991
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:37,540
I don't know. Yes. Well my friend was a tester for that game.

992
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:41,980
That's how I got on the Skywalker Ranch. Isn't this guy talking about like the...

993
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:47,040
I'm thinking like Loom and stuff. Dude, I love Loom. Yeah, that's what I was going to say, it was Loom was my favorite.

994
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:51,040
To be honest, there aren't that many Lucasarts games coming out. Now granted

995
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:55,280
Star Wars Empire at War just came out and that one looks really cool.

996
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,680
I'm not really into too much of the RTS stuff on the PC anymore,

997
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:02,400
but I like Battlefront too. I thought it was pretty cool.

998
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:08,200
The problem is they only release one game a year, basically.

999
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:11,200
When this guy said LucasArts game, my mind instantly went to the old school stuff.

1000
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,400
I wasn't even thinking Knights of the Old Republic, okay?

1001
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:17,400
I'm thinking Indiana Jones, I'm thinking Maniac Mansion.

1002
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:23,200
No, I'm thinking of the new things, just because my friend, when she worked for LucasArts,

1003
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,200
all I kept hearing her call it was Scrotor.

1004
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:33,480
And, actually, we did get to go to the Skywalker ranch while she was testing, and I was in

1005
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:36,680
meatloaf-licking distance of George Lucas, it was pretty cool, we walked through the

1006
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:37,680
cafeteria.

1007
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:41,400
PKAkira88 says Super Star Wars, which I would agree is one of my favorite Star Wars games

1008
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,400
of all time.

1009
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,400
Rock!

1010
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:44,400
Rock.

1011
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,400
I love the debug mode where you can just, like, breeze through the game.

1012
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:46,400
Alright, there's your LucasArts content.

1013
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:50,840
Just think about the LucasArts, um, what is it, the Star Wars on the revolution, that'll

1014
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:51,840
be sweet.

1015
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:52,840
It will.

1016
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:56,040
Twist wrote in about female characters in games.

1017
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:59,200
Ah, we got quite a response to that little bit last week, didn't we?

1018
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:04,740
Yeah. It was a pretty long one. He's one of the SoCal players.

1019
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:08,380
And played in Vegas, too.

1020
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:11,680
So go ahead, I want to read this one little part. On the subject of men who use

1021
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:12,520
female characters,

1022
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:15,960
I only use and look for the female character in almost any game. It's a habit.

1023
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:17,240
I use Julia in Tekken,

1024
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:20,880
Shenghua or Sunmina in Soulcalibur III,

1025
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,880
Pink Yoshi and melee

1026
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:32,560
Yoshi's a Yoshi Yoshi isn't male or female just Yoshi's. Oh, well, whatever what Diablo 2 plays a sorceress

1027
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:39,840
And a Street Fighter third strike truly is a top character that kicks ass she is a character

1028
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:42,600
I use myself while playing any Street Fighter game. I believe

1029
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,720
She is a top character in most Street Fighter games

1030
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:50,360
Senina in Tekken 5 is a top character as well as Sophia in Soulcalibur 3.

1031
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:52,400
Even Peach is a top character in Melee.

1032
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,520
So people who talk down on female characters are ignorant gamers or sexist which is why

1033
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,600
I like to play people like that.

1034
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:58,600
Knock some sense into them.

1035
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:00,800
I am completely straight male by the way.

1036
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:06,480
This is exactly why I play, or I'm going to play Rumble Roses XX for the awesome, strong

1037
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:07,960
female main characters.

1038
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:08,960
Yeah, right.

1039
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:09,960
Yeah, gotcha.

1040
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:10,960
One more little thing about...

1041
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:11,960
Oh yeah, go ahead.

1042
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:12,960
Okay.

1043
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,000
Is that there's also many girls who play in these big tournaments that I go to.

1044
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,680
one female gamer in the Tekken community is top three in her state and the show

1045
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:21,480
is great by the way I love it I would love to take on Dark Sakura and Tekken

1046
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:26,320
any of them Julia or Michelle all the way thing is I play Julia and I also

1047
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:32,440
play Jin and Huarang so it's on as we get Tekken online I agree with this

1048
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:37,760
letter except for the fact that Ivy will whoop Sophitia's butt any day thank you

1049
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:43,880
you know Ivy is badass I love it's still crazy though just because as far as the

1050
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:51,680
Soulcalibur series if anyone can play valdo oh my god it's over I know it's

1051
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:56,080
the freaking hardest character to learn and like easily the most of hardcore so

1052
01:02:56,080 --> 01:03:00,560
I you know you explored your horizons a little bit play some of the male

1053
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:05,760
characters you may be surprised but you know at the same time I've also got

1054
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:12,760
another one on the same line from Mac man so what this is basically you are

1055
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:16,480
I write Dark Sakura, I'm a straight guy, but my favorite character is Seungmina.

1056
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:19,080
She rocks and I don't feel any less of a man when I play her.

1057
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:23,900
I think we should do something like stopping online racism, like wouldn't that be sexism?

1058
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:28,020
If you give me those links, I'll say them on my podcast to inform them and tell what

1059
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:31,680
happened.

1060
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:37,320
Just for the record, I'm a gay man and I play female characters sometimes and I don't feel

1061
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:40,880
like any less of a man either, just for the record.

1062
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:44,220
I played, I picked Jin at first because I was a big Kazuya fan

1063
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:48,880
and now I'm just like, ooh, it's Jin, he's so cool. It really depends on the game I'm playing

1064
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:52,160
honestly. I don't necessarily gravitate towards the female characters but I

1065
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:52,840
agree that

1066
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:56,680
like, you know, Soul Calibur, Ivy's where it's at, but you know

1067
01:03:56,680 --> 01:04:00,080
Tekken, I don't know, I was a bit more of a Huarong fan

1068
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:05,040
than I was, you know, Julia, so who knows. Huarong looked like a guy I dated in high

1069
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:05,440
school

1070
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:08,520
seriously. Anyway. Okay, anyway

1071
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:22,040
Also, our friend RobWitubies emailed us with something about Stay Alive.

1072
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:23,040
It's filmed very well.

1073
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:24,040
Dialogue is okay.

1074
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:25,040
The plot is pretty good.

1075
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:29,240
Unfortunately, I was the only one in the theater who didn't think it was scary, so I was in

1076
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,240
the minority.

1077
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:34,000
But if you ever played a survival horror, this was tame, and in fact I think it's PG-13

1078
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,320
because all violence was off camera.

1079
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:41,560
On the negative, Frank Venus is still playing a Malcolm-like character when actor was sort

1080
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:44,520
of non-existent and another was just awful.

1081
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:47,760
The sound editors know nothing about current computer games because the Internet Cafe had

1082
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:50,800
an Atari 2600 Donkey Kong sounds in the background.

1083
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:54,160
It's always that or Atari 2600 Pac-Man sounds in the background.

1084
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,000
When will they ever get it right?

1085
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,560
Could that be a licensing thing though?

1086
01:04:58,560 --> 01:04:59,560
Humor me here for me.

1087
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:01,800
Could that be maybe that they can't use sounds from current games because then they have

1088
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:02,800
to get permission?

1089
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,680
I don't know.

1090
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:05,680
Just a thought.

1091
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:06,680
The last thing on this is...

1092
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:07,680
Let me put it this way, though.

1093
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:10,740
You could seriously do just the sound effects of like an arcade.

1094
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:11,740
Remember Terminator 2?

1095
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:12,740
Like, yeah, like a...

1096
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:14,340
That would be at least more current than...

1097
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:15,340
Okay.

1098
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:16,340
Boop, boop, boop.

1099
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:17,340
Boing, boing, boing.

1100
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:18,340
Boing, boing, boing, boing.

1101
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:19,340
So go ahead and finish this.

1102
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:23,480
The writer obviously knows video games at least, however, it was a very big ad for Alienware.

1103
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:27,120
It was worth a matinee, at least.

1104
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:29,300
Maybe I'll put it in the Netflix queue.

1105
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:32,080
That's about the most that that movie's gonna get from me.

1106
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:33,080
I don't think so.

1107
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:34,080
All right.

1108
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:35,080
Is that it for the mailbag?

1109
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:42,320
mailbag and move on to more stories. If you are a PlayStation 1 devotee, well, it's over

1110
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:48,500
for you. Not really. What I'm trying to say is that the PlayStation consoles, the PS1s

1111
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:53,840
are no longer going to be made. Sony has stopped all production of the original PlayStation

1112
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:57,500
console because, of course, now they need to start focusing their efforts on putting

1113
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:03,240
out the PlayStation 3. They haven't made games for the PlayStation 1 in like years. I think

1114
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:05,840
There was actually a release, no that was Dreamcast.

1115
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:09,440
Yeah, but those are like little indie things, no major release in a long time.

1116
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:12,440
I thought they stopped production in PlayStation 1 when like the PlayStation 2 came out.

1117
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:16,840
You know what though, for folks that can't afford PS2s, PS1's a nice alternative, right?

1118
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:19,840
You don't even want to see the stack of them sitting in our game room.

1119
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:24,740
Yeah, so you know, I, yeah, me too, I was a little, my biggest surprise from this article

1120
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:27,540
was they, they're just now stopping.

1121
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:31,440
When you can go to the flea market and buy an old deck for what, 20 bucks?

1122
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:38,940
Yeah, but it's pretty much over there for PS1s, no more new ones will be found at the stores.

1123
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:45,240
Dark Sakura, a little bit of some rumors going around the internet this week about Nintendo Revolution, right?

1124
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:48,940
Oh yeah, there's a speculated name coming out.

1125
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:57,840
Basically, a blog called Engadget got a hold of a photograph from a slide at a Nintendo presentation.

1126
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:03,860
It was a blue cube looking thing formed out of opposing D-pads that was hovering over

1127
01:07:03,860 --> 01:07:07,320
a name that said Nintendo Go.

1128
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:11,240
Later on they got a photo that looked like a brochure that had the same name on it.

1129
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:16,340
But Iwata hasn't said anything to support that.

1130
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:19,080
They said they were supposed to announce the real name and never did.

1131
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:24,520
Now, also another interesting theory was that Go is the number five in Japanese and that

1132
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:27,520
this would be Nintendo's fifth system, which would be kind of a nice tie-in.

1133
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:28,520
There is that too.

1134
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:30,960
Well, now, of course, those rumors are going around the internet.

1135
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:36,800
Well, Nintendo has proven in the past, though, the N64 was supposed to be a code name for

1136
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:43,360
the Nintendo 64, but it came out as the Nintendo 64, so they've done things like this before.

1137
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:46,040
Their code names have made it as official names.

1138
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:50,000
I think Revolution would just be cool to have it as a name, that'd be awesome, but you know.

1139
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,640
Well, now, here's the follow-up to that, is that the Go theory has been somewhat debunked.

1140
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:59,040
I mean, of course you're going to have your holdouts that still stick onto that, but now

1141
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:04,980
this other blog, we're getting this off of Go Nintendo, actually has a comparison to

1142
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:12,160
this program, NAMO Web Editor 5, exact same logo as the Nintendo Go, and somebody apparently

1143
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:16,840
translated all the little Japanese text that showed up, and it looks like it's pretty much

1144
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:23,580
a fake, so unless there's some fluke going on, it's likely that Nintendo Go is a no-go.

1145
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:28,620
But who knows, rumors get started somewhere, but not too likely.

1146
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:33,660
I think the Nintendo Go would be a better name for a handheld system, because I think

1147
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:37,780
they're on their fifth handheld system too, whenever the next one comes out.

1148
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:41,180
I think the most creative explanation I read somewhere on the internet on some feedback

1149
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:46,580
thread was that Nintendo Go sounds like a good gaming online thing, because if you go

1150
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:50,380
gaming online, maybe that's the name of their online system.

1151
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:51,700
That could be a definite possibility.

1152
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:53,700
There's a little speculation at this time, though.

1153
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:55,700
Exactly, so that's, I think-

1154
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:57,700
I just still have this mental image, though, from

1155
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,700
the first few episodes of Red Dwarf

1156
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:01,700
where everyone-

1157
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:03,700
no, not Red Dwarf, I'm messing with Red Dwarf, from Star Trek

1158
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:05,700
where everyone was addicted to the little

1159
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:07,700
game thing

1160
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:09,700
that we're gonna keep seeing

1161
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:11,700
more and more systems come out and they're gonna

1162
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:13,700
be wired into our brains and

1163
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:15,700
we'll all be addicts. There's also an

1164
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:17,700
episode of Sea Quest.

1165
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:19,700
I don't know.

1166
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:26,660
Let's see, moving on, a completely different type of game here, StarCraft Ghost.

1167
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:31,060
StarCraft Ghost has been indefinitely postponed and that's going to be a big disappointment

1168
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:32,840
there to StarCraft fans.

1169
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:36,640
They have announced earlier this week that they are going to be focusing the company's

1170
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:43,220
console development efforts on the next generation of console platforms.

1171
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:47,900
This means that StarCraft Ghost was supposed to be this console title that was going to

1172
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:48,900
be coming out.

1173
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:53,360
announced way back in 2003, well now they postponed it because they want to go

1174
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:57,380
basically to the next-gen systems. So I guess, you know, it doesn't necessarily mean that

1175
01:09:57,380 --> 01:09:59,500
StarCraft Ghost is never gonna happen,

1176
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:02,620
but you're gonna be waiting a little while for this one.

1177
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:05,780
Last date I heard of it was in Fall anyway, so...

1178
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:09,180
It's gonna go next-gen if it's gonna happen at all, which, you know, you could

1179
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:11,100
look at that either way as good news or bad news.

1180
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:14,980
Well, they're probably just thinking, well hey, you know, by the time this thing comes out,

1181
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:19,460
you know, the next-gen systems are going to be launching anyways, might as well.

1182
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:23,780
Alright, let's move over to Jamie who has a story for us on some wheelin' and dealin' with Sega.

1183
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:29,460
Yeah, Sega is working with Obsidian to make a role-play game for the PC,

1184
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:34,420
the PlayStation 3, and the Xbox 360, but it doesn't have a name or a release date yet.

1185
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:37,300
But we are probably going to see stuff on the City 3.

1186
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:42,980
Really, Sega has been doing a lot more partnerships with a bunch of different companies

1187
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:47,340
like bizarre creation silicon knights monolith they've just acquired creative

1188
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:54,260
assembly it was a UK company the only thing that's really worked out well with

1189
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:58,900
creative assembly they had a the total war series they had condemned with

1190
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:10,940
monolith but as far as the that's right as far as the game that's coming out

1191
01:11:10,940 --> 01:11:15,440
though they say they're really excited to be working together both both

1192
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:21,840
companies especially working there's a quote on here from Fergus Iqart I guess

1193
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:26,960
CEO of Obsidian Entertainment says they're excited to be working with a

1194
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:30,600
great publisher like Sega as they are willing and excited to launch new and

1195
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:35,960
visionary IP on next-generation consoles. I think it's very interesting all these

1196
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:39,260
kind of like little partnerships Sega's doing like here and there like they team

1197
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:43,940
up with these guys for this game, it's kind of interesting, so that's all I can really

1198
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:44,940
say.

1199
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:46,820
Until we see the game, all we kind of know is, interesting.

1200
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:50,260
You know I'll be ghosting around Sega's area at E3.

1201
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:53,020
Of course, I missed them last year, so this year I really need to...

1202
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:55,660
They had those big comfy chairs.

1203
01:11:55,660 --> 01:11:59,300
Universe was supposed to be out by now, Phantasy Star Universe, but now they've pushed it back

1204
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:00,300
so...

1205
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:01,300
Into the real world.

1206
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:02,820
We'll see it again at E3 this year, right?

1207
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:04,700
Maybe they will have fixed our complaints.

1208
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:05,700
Possibly.

1209
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:06,700
We'll see.

1210
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:10,740
on also in some wheeling and dealing of course Peter Moore is known as the big

1211
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:16,060
talker what's he talking about this week Loki next-gen sequels you gotta love

1212
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:20,180
these are kind of to me I don't know these are kind of like duh you know duh

1213
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:24,780
this is gonna come out for example they're talking about sequel to the

1214
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:29,500
Forza franchise duh I mean of course it's just like you know Gran Turismo on

1215
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:36,500
Xbox. Then, so the other ones, they mentioned Fable. I mean, come on. Really? Fable? Getting

1216
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:42,700
a sequel? I mean, gee, I didn't know the game did well or anything. And then finally, Crimson

1217
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:46,140
Skies was going to be another one that was going to be getting a sequel, which is great

1218
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:51,640
because we need some more aerial combat games. What about the one that just had the demo

1219
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:58,640
this week on Xbox? Well, more than that! We need more than one! No we don't. Yes we do.

1220
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:01,440
So that's just my opinion, no we don't.

1221
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:02,840
Whatever, okay.

1222
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:05,800
Anyways, one game that is not going to be getting a sequel is going to be

1223
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:09,580
Mecha Salt, because apparently Mecha Salt didn't sell very well.

1224
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:13,340
That's okay though, because ChromeHounds is coming out, that's all I need to hear, so.

1225
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:15,660
ChromeHounds and Armored Core, alright.

1226
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:19,900
Well good job on our Duh! Story of the Week for most of that stuff.

1227
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:20,780
Just teasing ya.

1228
01:13:20,780 --> 01:13:23,960
Uh... moving on, Game Developers Conference, we talked a lot about that

1229
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:26,960
earlier. We didn't talk about the awards that were given out though, the Game

1230
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:32,040
Game Developers Choice Awards specifically were handed out, and not a lot of surprises

1231
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:33,640
here when you look at some of the winners.

1232
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:40,060
Best Game was named to be Shadow of the Colossus, Best Audio Guitar Hero, Shadow of the Colossus

1233
01:13:40,060 --> 01:13:46,760
also won Best Character Design, Best Game Design, Best Visual Arts, and also shared

1234
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,440
honors and innovation.

1235
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:53,360
Guitar Hero also shared innovation along with Nintendogs also got an innovation nod, also

1236
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:56,040
winning there for Best Technology.

1237
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:59,980
The other game that snuck in there, Psychonauts, for best writing.

1238
01:13:59,980 --> 01:14:04,400
So congratulations to all the winners, which were only equated to about four different

1239
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:08,760
games there, but certainly some of the most critically allotted games of the past year,

1240
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:10,840
so good job.

1241
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:16,960
All right, and lastly for this little segment here, Loki, I really don't know how to set

1242
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:20,460
this one up.

1243
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:23,400
This could win an Innovation Award at next year's GDC, yes?

1244
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:28,120
Yes, it really puts you in the game.

1245
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:31,080
I don't know if Dark Sakura will be able to play this though.

1246
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:32,080
What?

1247
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:37,600
Anyways, have you ever thought when you're out and about, you know, god damn it, wish

1248
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,520
I could pee and play a game at the same time.

1249
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:42,400
That would save so much time.

1250
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:46,240
Well, now you might get to.

1251
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:51,360
It's actually part of an art installation right now at a museum, but designer Marcel

1252
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:57,480
Neandorfer, has actually created urinals with interactive games built in and activated and

1253
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:09,760
controlled by, uh, streaming media. And basically, um, I don't know, to me it's kind of stupid

1254
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:16,720
because, I mean, streaming media? I mean, really, how long can you be playing a game

1255
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:19,760
when you're, you know, taking a piss. I mean, seriously.

1256
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:23,480
What if I'm pee-shy? I mean, that puts me at a handicap.

1257
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:27,280
Is it multiplayer?

1258
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:31,680
Do they have a trough version of this game for, you know, those urinals that are just

1259
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:32,680
a big trough?

1260
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:33,840
I mean, what's next, poo on the target?

1261
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:37,640
Oh, that's disgusting. That's disgusting. DarkSakura, are you going to learn how to

1262
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:39,840
pee standing up just to play this game?

1263
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:42,840
Fuck no!

1264
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:44,840
Disgusting.

1265
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:45,840
That's so stupid!

1266
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,600
That'd be great though.

1267
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,120
Only in an art show do we see something like that.

1268
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:53,920
If you want to go like sick in a more demented game, whatever, you can get some sort of technology

1269
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:59,120
like that that measures the size of the crap that you take, and it puts you on like a leaderboard,

1270
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:03,600
you know, kind of a ranking system so that you can see how far, how you fare against

1271
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:04,920
other crappers out there.

1272
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:08,200
You know, we had, we already had the game Golden Tea.

1273
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:12,300
This show has officially gone down the toilet, so I think it's time for us to take a little

1274
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:13,300
break here.

1275
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:36,940
We'll be back after this little break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
