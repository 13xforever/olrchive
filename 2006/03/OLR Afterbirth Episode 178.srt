1
00:00:00,391 --> 00:00:00,854
Yummy!

2
00:00:06,065 --> 00:00:15,033
[SPEAKER_14]: We're back here with the Afterbirth, and you know, I think this might be one of the longest shows on the records for us here at Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:15,053 --> 00:00:17,916
[SPEAKER_14]: We're almost already to 9 o'clock, so kind of interesting.

4
00:00:18,856 --> 00:00:21,439
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, so we've got a lot of stuff we want to cover here in the Afterbirth.

5
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:27,324
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go ahead and start off with a little bit of how was your week, how was your day, really quickly go around and see what's going on in our personal lives.

6
00:00:27,404 --> 00:00:29,826
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember, the Afterbirth, this is the portion that is...

7
00:00:30,146 --> 00:00:30,746
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura.com

8
00:00:48,035 --> 00:00:49,196
[SPEAKER_10]: And then went to the grocery store.

9
00:00:50,396 --> 00:00:55,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Other than that, I sprained my wrist last Friday, which I might have mentioned on the show.

10
00:00:56,179 --> 00:00:59,120
[SPEAKER_10]: Because my cat was being a retard.

11
00:00:59,981 --> 00:01:05,283
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was leaning over to pet her and balancing myself on the chair as I was getting up.

12
00:01:05,884 --> 00:01:08,165
[SPEAKER_10]: And she bumped into my leg, knocked me just enough off balance.

13
00:01:08,245 --> 00:01:09,906
[SPEAKER_10]: And my wrist is a little sore now.

14
00:01:10,026 --> 00:01:11,166
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually better.

15
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,307
[SPEAKER_10]: But I couldn't play anything all week except Ragnarok.

16
00:01:13,627 --> 00:01:14,508
[SPEAKER_10]: It really got on my nerves.

17
00:01:15,568 --> 00:01:17,670
[SPEAKER_10]: However, you know, I did play a lot of Ragnarok.

18
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:23,635
[SPEAKER_10]: I also, I have homework that I've been putting off all week that I didn't do today.

19
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:25,897
[SPEAKER_14]: Good job.

20
00:01:25,937 --> 00:01:27,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm really responsible.

21
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:29,660
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's going to be turned in late.

22
00:01:31,021 --> 00:01:32,902
[SPEAKER_10]: And really that's about it.

23
00:01:33,103 --> 00:01:34,163
[SPEAKER_10]: I've just had a very busy week.

24
00:01:34,784 --> 00:01:35,044
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

25
00:01:35,765 --> 00:01:36,685
[SPEAKER_12]: Extifer, how was your week?

26
00:01:36,725 --> 00:01:37,106
[SPEAKER_12]: How was your day?

27
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,436
[SPEAKER_12]: The week was fine.

28
00:01:42,756 --> 00:01:47,598
[SPEAKER_12]: I was sick a couple days out of the week, but it's already passed and everything.

29
00:01:48,838 --> 00:01:56,560
[SPEAKER_12]: I went back to Final Fantasy XI after you guys all went back, and I decided, okay, well, I'll try a different character.

30
00:01:57,141 --> 00:01:59,981
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm not a white mage anymore, and I'm not a black mage anymore.

31
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:00,582
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm a thief.

32
00:02:01,362 --> 00:02:02,682
[SPEAKER_12]: So yay, thieves.

33
00:02:03,322 --> 00:02:03,602
[SPEAKER_12]: Thieves.

34
00:02:03,802 --> 00:02:04,423
[SPEAKER_12]: Because you know what?

35
00:02:04,683 --> 00:02:04,703
[SPEAKER_12]: I...

36
00:02:05,803 --> 00:02:09,285
[SPEAKER_12]: Play a rogue in World of Warcraft and it's pretty much the same thing.

37
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:13,668
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyways, and then today I had a good time with my boyfriend.

38
00:02:13,788 --> 00:02:16,190
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, I had a really good time with my boyfriend this whole weekend.

39
00:02:17,111 --> 00:02:18,632
[SPEAKER_12]: And... Yay.

40
00:02:19,732 --> 00:02:19,993
[SPEAKER_12]: Shut up.

41
00:02:20,633 --> 00:02:24,515
[SPEAKER_12]: And we went to the video games live on Friday, which was cool.

42
00:02:25,516 --> 00:02:26,477
[SPEAKER_12]: So, yay, boyfriend.

43
00:02:28,698 --> 00:02:29,379
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, how was your week?

44
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,520
[SPEAKER_13]: How was your day?

45
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,561
[SPEAKER_13]: My week is okay.

46
00:02:33,581 --> 00:02:33,621
[SPEAKER_13]: Um...

47
00:02:35,714 --> 00:02:36,674
[SPEAKER_13]: What did I do this week?

48
00:02:36,834 --> 00:02:37,194
[SPEAKER_13]: Shit.

49
00:02:38,195 --> 00:02:41,276
[SPEAKER_13]: Um... Well, no, I don't think I did anything too important.

50
00:02:41,676 --> 00:02:42,636
[SPEAKER_13]: I did play more Oblivion.

51
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:43,857
[SPEAKER_13]: That was fun.

52
00:02:44,457 --> 00:02:49,418
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um, tomorrow I'm supposed to be going to get a marriage license.

53
00:02:51,059 --> 00:02:52,739
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I'm actually taking the day off.

54
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:54,740
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's only going to take about half an hour.

55
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:01,042
[SPEAKER_13]: But I have to drive up to Plasterville and that's like, what, like an hour... No, not an hour away, but like 30 minutes away.

56
00:03:02,342 --> 00:03:03,643
[SPEAKER_13]: And no one likes going to Plasterville.

57
00:03:03,663 --> 00:03:04,423
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, you know...

58
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:08,070
[SPEAKER_13]: Hickville

59
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:20,744
[SPEAKER_13]: Just, oh, and of course we went down to San Jose and that was fun.

60
00:03:21,305 --> 00:03:22,186
[SPEAKER_13]: And that was really cool.

61
00:03:22,766 --> 00:03:32,457
[SPEAKER_13]: And the quasi, now I gotta mention though, when we were at Genji, there's, it is basically your Benihana's type of restaurant.

62
00:03:32,537 --> 00:03:33,177
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a teppanyaki.

63
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,899
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, where they, you know, cook in front of you.

64
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,945
[SPEAKER_13]: But they did, Benihana's does this thing where they make like a volcano out of the onions.

65
00:03:40,485 --> 00:03:46,948
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, Genji took it one step further, that put them on top, as far as the onion section goes, with me.

66
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:54,352
[SPEAKER_13]: And that would be that they took the onion, and they made a little volcano, and they poured the water in there, and then it caused the same, ooh, volcano!

67
00:03:54,632 --> 00:04:01,615
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, then he took, you know, alcohol, poured the alcohol in there, and lit it on fire, and that was freaking sweet.

68
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:04,357
[SPEAKER_10]: They do that at another place in town, called Katana.

69
00:04:05,397 --> 00:04:05,938
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I don't care.

70
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,779
[SPEAKER_13]: This is just cool.

71
00:04:10,664 --> 00:04:16,224
[SPEAKER_13]: Other than that, no, I didn't do too much else.

72
00:04:17,014 --> 00:04:17,975
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

73
00:04:18,095 --> 00:04:20,837
[SPEAKER_14]: My week and my day was okay.

74
00:04:20,917 --> 00:04:23,279
[SPEAKER_14]: I was still really sick this week with my sinus infection.

75
00:04:23,299 --> 00:04:27,081
[SPEAKER_14]: It just kind of kept me down for a little while, and I didn't really get to go to the gym at all, which kind of pissed me off.

76
00:04:27,121 --> 00:04:28,122
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm better now.

77
00:04:28,182 --> 00:04:29,223
[SPEAKER_14]: Yesterday was my first day.

78
00:04:29,243 --> 00:04:32,485
[SPEAKER_14]: It was zero meds, zero anything, so I feel much better now.

79
00:04:32,545 --> 00:04:33,186
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

80
00:04:34,447 --> 00:04:42,973
[SPEAKER_14]: And otherwise, I've been doing a lot of gaming because, you know, just everything on the 360 and the DS and Final Fantasy and all that stuff, good times.

81
00:04:43,373 --> 00:04:43,513
[SPEAKER_14]: And...

82
00:04:45,254 --> 00:04:51,781
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess, Tuesday we already pretty much talked about, that was a great night Put down my DS, Extifer, what are you doing?

83
00:04:53,662 --> 00:04:54,023
[SPEAKER_14]: No!

84
00:04:55,024 --> 00:04:55,584
[SPEAKER_14]: What are you playing?

85
00:04:56,405 --> 00:04:56,745
[SPEAKER_14]: Extifer?

86
00:04:57,646 --> 00:05:05,534
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Tetris Alright Dork, alright, anyway Great radio

87
00:05:07,045 --> 00:05:07,906
[SPEAKER_14]: Xtifer's Movie Review

88
00:05:30,026 --> 00:05:30,446
[SPEAKER_12]: V for Vendetta

89
00:05:47,398 --> 00:05:52,383
[SPEAKER_12]: And I also want to get the t-shirt that has the snakes and then plus plane equals snakes on a plane.

90
00:05:52,403 --> 00:05:56,206
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, when I mentioned snakes on a plane to you, you were like, what is that?

91
00:05:56,226 --> 00:05:56,907
[SPEAKER_12]: That's stupid.

92
00:05:57,668 --> 00:05:59,049
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I still think it's stupid.

93
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,390
[SPEAKER_12]: I think everybody thinks it's stupid.

94
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:00,791
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the point.

95
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:02,272
[SPEAKER_03]: It's snakes on a plane.

96
00:06:02,452 --> 00:06:04,054
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and I want to see it now.

97
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:09,275
[SPEAKER_12]: But the movie itself, it was really well done.

98
00:06:09,355 --> 00:06:18,818
[SPEAKER_12]: It really has a lot of important issues in it that I think kind of pertain to today's current events and everything.

99
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,359
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think everybody should see it.

100
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:23,159
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's better than The Matrix.

101
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,920
[SPEAKER_12]: It's from the people who brought out The Matrix.

102
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,840
[SPEAKER_12]: And I wasn't a big fan of The Matrix.

103
00:06:27,481 --> 00:06:29,701
[SPEAKER_12]: But I really liked this movie a lot.

104
00:06:29,801 --> 00:06:31,462
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's one of the best movies I've seen this year.

105
00:06:32,282 --> 00:06:33,004
[SPEAKER_12]: So two thumbs up?

106
00:06:33,906 --> 00:06:35,549
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, two big dicks up.

107
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,112
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, thank you.

108
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:41,221
[SPEAKER_14]: Two snakes up!

109
00:06:43,305 --> 00:06:43,586
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

110
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:48,582
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see, I mentioned there on the Skype line earlier.

111
00:06:48,662 --> 00:06:50,784
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, first off, we're going to open it back up very soon here.

112
00:06:50,824 --> 00:06:56,651
[SPEAKER_14]: But on the Skype line earlier, we told one of our callers that we would actually take a look at this live on air.

113
00:06:57,252 --> 00:06:58,634
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm going to try and pull this up here.

114
00:06:58,714 --> 00:07:00,436
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see if I can locate the file.

115
00:07:00,936 --> 00:07:01,277
[SPEAKER_14]: It says...

116
00:07:02,738 --> 00:07:03,859
[SPEAKER_14]: MTV.

117
00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:04,619
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, here we go.

118
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:06,600
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is that MTV interview.

119
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,821
[SPEAKER_14]: We haven't done Orange Lounge Radio at the movies in a long time.

120
00:07:09,161 --> 00:07:12,963
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have this MTV interview with Sketch, who's a DDR player.

121
00:07:13,263 --> 00:07:18,906
[SPEAKER_14]: Keep in mind, usually when we do Orange Lounge Radio at the movies, we have a chance to watch this clip in advance and kind of prep what we want to say.

122
00:07:19,346 --> 00:07:20,387
[SPEAKER_14]: But tonight, not the case.

123
00:07:20,427 --> 00:07:22,048
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're just going to watch this and see how it goes.

124
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:22,528
[SPEAKER_14]: So here it is.

125
00:07:22,688 --> 00:07:23,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Now wait, hold on a minute.

126
00:07:23,608 --> 00:07:26,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't DDR something that's designed to be played at home?

127
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Kids, I'm gonna warn ya!

128
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:27,571
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm stupid.

129
00:07:43,123 --> 00:07:47,667
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, well, I'm guessing that he's saying that because this guy is going to do some insane tricks here.

130
00:07:47,928 --> 00:07:51,671
[SPEAKER_14]: Guys, I apologize for the volume on this video, but the video volume is insanely low.

131
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:55,054
[SPEAKER_14]: I have it jacked up as high as it'll go, so you'll just have to deal here for a little bit.

132
00:07:55,695 --> 00:07:56,355
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, let's move on.

133
00:07:56,395 --> 00:07:58,838
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see what is so freaking insane about this.

134
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:15,893
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, moving on.

135
00:08:43,103 --> 00:08:45,705
[SPEAKER_09]: For most of us, Dance Dance Revolution is something you do for fun.

136
00:08:45,885 --> 00:08:52,069
[SPEAKER_09]: But for Anthony Carrella here, the New York City DDR champion, quite possibly the best in the world, this is really serious business.

137
00:08:52,789 --> 00:08:53,190
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously.

138
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:59,154
[SPEAKER_14]: I bet about... No offense to this guy, I don't know him, but I bet there's about 50 people on the internet waiting to dispute this claim.

139
00:08:59,934 --> 00:09:02,476
[SPEAKER_14]: And you know that there's people jealous that this guy got TV time.

140
00:09:02,836 --> 00:09:03,457
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you know what?

141
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:09,025
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not like, you know, MTV doing actual research on something.

142
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:12,330
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going to doubt this guy's good.

143
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:16,437
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just going to say there are going to be 50 people lined up wanting to dispute that claim.

144
00:09:16,537 --> 00:09:17,178
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all I'm saying.

145
00:09:21,744 --> 00:09:23,527
[SPEAKER_00]: I just started playing about four years ago.

146
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,416
[SPEAKER_00]: I found solace in the game because I had a breakup with my girlfriend.

147
00:09:28,757 --> 00:09:30,500
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's addicting, man.

148
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,321
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't stop playing.

149
00:09:31,341 --> 00:09:32,463
[SPEAKER_00]: I just love playing it.

150
00:09:33,086 --> 00:09:33,966
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I'm sorry, that's lame.

151
00:09:35,327 --> 00:09:36,147
[SPEAKER_14]: Not his reasoning.

152
00:09:36,687 --> 00:09:39,288
[SPEAKER_14]: They made him play DDR while he's being interviewed.

153
00:09:39,368 --> 00:09:41,329
[SPEAKER_14]: That is the ultimate in cheeseball.

154
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:41,769
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

155
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:42,589
[SPEAKER_10]: That's really stupid.

156
00:09:42,909 --> 00:09:47,231
[SPEAKER_10]: Whoever attributed MTV with doing anything really intelligent, other than remote control.

157
00:09:47,351 --> 00:09:52,052
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes me and my friends would wake up at 9 o'clock, go down to Coney Island, play all day.

158
00:09:52,512 --> 00:09:54,373
[SPEAKER_00]: Go home at 8 o'clock, wake up, do it again.

159
00:09:54,413 --> 00:09:55,333
[SPEAKER_00]: We would do it for about a week.

160
00:09:55,533 --> 00:10:01,055
[SPEAKER_00]: It usually runs me, not even a lot, about 20 to 40 bucks every time I go to the arcade.

161
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:06,248
[SPEAKER_14]: Which, by the way, you'll notice this guy is one of the skinniest people I've ever seen in my life.

162
00:10:06,308 --> 00:10:07,949
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's why, right there.

163
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,752
[SPEAKER_14]: Look at that, he is skinny.

164
00:10:11,232 --> 00:10:11,872
[SPEAKER_14]: Very, very skinny.

165
00:10:13,894 --> 00:10:19,719
[SPEAKER_00]: From about 2003 to 2004, I was undefeated in all New York City fair options tournaments.

166
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,041
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's because you're on the East Coast.

167
00:10:23,962 --> 00:10:24,723
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, burn.

168
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:26,810
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just teasing.

169
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,713
[SPEAKER_14]: Here comes all the hate mail from the East Coast.

170
00:10:28,733 --> 00:10:30,256
[SPEAKER_14]: This guy, you asshole.

171
00:10:30,476 --> 00:10:31,097
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm teasing.

172
00:10:31,257 --> 00:10:31,758
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a joke.

173
00:10:31,918 --> 00:10:32,759
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just starting shit.

174
00:10:34,284 --> 00:10:40,909
[SPEAKER_00]: I take pride in saying that I'm one of the few people, if not the only person in the world, that could stealth every hard 10-footer in the game backwards.

175
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:43,350
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning I could do it without looking or I could turn the arrows on.

176
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,351
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, let me put it this way.

177
00:10:44,391 --> 00:10:47,533
[SPEAKER_13]: If you can stealth it going forward, you can stealth it backwards.

178
00:10:47,653 --> 00:10:49,875
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I restarted the video.

179
00:10:50,455 --> 00:10:51,556
[SPEAKER_14]: No, sorry.

180
00:10:51,996 --> 00:10:53,717
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's addicting, man.

181
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:54,538
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't stop playing.

182
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:57,680
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, you gotta hear some of it over again because I fucked up.

183
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,861
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes me and my friends would...

184
00:10:59,281 --> 00:11:19,939
[SPEAKER_00]: Wake up at 9 o'clock, go down to Coney Island Fuck that dude, I used to wake up or not wake up I used to go after midnight, go down to CCL and play until 3 in the morning That is pretty hardcore Okay, here comes the stealth line again From about 2003 to 2004, I was undefeated in all New York City fair options tournaments

185
00:11:22,423 --> 00:11:29,047
[SPEAKER_00]: I take pride in saying that I'm one of the few people, if not the only person in the world, that could stealth every hard 10-footer in the game, backwards.

186
00:11:29,247 --> 00:11:31,489
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning I could do it without looking, or I could turn the arrows on.

187
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,372
[SPEAKER_14]: That just takes some insane memorization.

188
00:11:36,432 --> 00:11:41,035
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you really do have to play the game a lot to know those songs, you know, like the back of your hand.

189
00:11:41,355 --> 00:11:43,556
[SPEAKER_10]: It's active repetition.

190
00:11:43,576 --> 00:11:47,719
[SPEAKER_14]: Didn't you say you played so much Love on DDR2 that you could do the same thing?

191
00:11:47,819 --> 00:11:47,959
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

192
00:11:47,979 --> 00:11:50,341
[SPEAKER_14]: I used to be able to do that, Diamond Rage.

193
00:11:51,942 --> 00:11:52,563
[SPEAKER_14]: Dynamite Rave

194
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:12,310
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, I don't know this whole thing, what it's all about, because I've been playing Tetris.

195
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:21,713
[SPEAKER_12]: But I just heard him say that and everything, and I'm like, it takes somebody so arrogant and so full of themselves to say that I'm the only person in the world who can do this.

196
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,553
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I'm pretty sure he's not.

197
00:12:24,214 --> 00:12:27,114
[SPEAKER_14]: To this guy's credit, though, MTV's probably coaxing this out of him.

198
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:27,855
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I mean?

199
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:32,756
[SPEAKER_14]: I know what these interview people can be sometimes, and he's probably... I don't know.

200
00:12:32,816 --> 00:12:35,897
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know this guy, so I'm not going to assume anything.

201
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,496
[SPEAKER_00]: If I work out, I'm not working out to get fit.

202
00:12:41,516 --> 00:12:44,118
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working out to see if I could get a better score on a song.

203
00:12:44,298 --> 00:12:45,279
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not listening to music.

204
00:12:45,319 --> 00:12:48,161
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking of ways that I could get better and do things better.

205
00:12:48,181 --> 00:12:51,103
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, dude.

206
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:54,845
[SPEAKER_08]: So you have a huge tournament coming up, the huge championship, right?

207
00:12:55,226 --> 00:12:57,367
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't train 24 hours a day in an arcade.

208
00:12:57,387 --> 00:12:57,887
[SPEAKER_08]: So what do you do?

209
00:12:57,927 --> 00:12:58,748
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you prepping at home?

210
00:13:02,964 --> 00:13:04,424
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the pad at home.

211
00:13:04,525 --> 00:13:05,625
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm playing on the pad.

212
00:13:05,645 --> 00:13:07,946
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have these step charts that I'm looking at.

213
00:13:08,086 --> 00:13:12,867
[SPEAKER_00]: They're step charts of the hardest songs in the games, cheat sheets if you want to call them.

214
00:13:13,027 --> 00:13:17,949
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at those patterns and I'm trying to figure out what I'm going to use on people, what I'm not going to use on people.

215
00:13:17,969 --> 00:13:19,349
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get my confidence up.

216
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,930
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not only a physical thing, it's a mental thing.

217
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,250
[SPEAKER_08]: You think you're going to win this tournament?

218
00:13:23,731 --> 00:13:24,091
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm winning.

219
00:13:24,411 --> 00:13:27,892
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even a question of whether I think I'm going to win or not, I'm winning.

220
00:13:29,707 --> 00:13:31,349
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me explain to you who these people are.

221
00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:34,372
[SPEAKER_00]: This is New York's finest, DDPD.

222
00:13:34,552 --> 00:13:36,514
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm focused on most is tech, expert.

223
00:13:36,675 --> 00:13:37,576
[SPEAKER_00]: You ready, Sketch?

224
00:13:38,477 --> 00:13:38,757
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ready.

225
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:38,997
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go.

226
00:13:39,017 --> 00:13:39,778
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.

227
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:41,400
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be very competitive.

228
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,722
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the best players from the country are in it.

229
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:45,344
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the $2,000.

230
00:13:45,584 --> 00:13:47,587
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.

231
00:13:50,174 --> 00:13:52,396
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the speed mile record for New York City.

232
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:57,742
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the first person to get the highest score in the hardest only course in the game, Legend Row, which is a marathon course.

233
00:13:57,922 --> 00:13:59,524
[SPEAKER_00]: I've cleared over a thousand beats per minute.

234
00:13:59,924 --> 00:14:01,065
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rank myself up there.

235
00:14:01,085 --> 00:14:02,026
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rank myself the best.

236
00:14:02,146 --> 00:14:06,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Me, me, me, me, I, I, I, I. A thousand beats a minute?

237
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:07,632
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, what?

238
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,212
[SPEAKER_14]: I think he's talking about the arrow scroll speed.

239
00:14:10,812 --> 00:14:12,474
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, but... Yeah, I know, I know.

240
00:14:13,594 --> 00:14:16,216
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to sound cocky, but I work hard for it.

241
00:14:16,597 --> 00:14:21,480
[SPEAKER_13]: Not to sound cocky or anything, but... Did I mention how awesome I am?

242
00:14:25,483 --> 00:14:26,384
[SPEAKER_10]: We had it taken off.

243
00:14:27,304 --> 00:14:27,805
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold on, hold on.

244
00:14:28,465 --> 00:14:29,926
[SPEAKER_14]: Extifer, hold on.

245
00:14:30,046 --> 00:14:30,927
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's reaffirm something here.

246
00:14:31,968 --> 00:14:34,970
[SPEAKER_14]: How much about this whole DDR and the culture and everything do you know about?

247
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:37,340
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know that much actually.

248
00:14:58,587 --> 00:15:00,648
[SPEAKER_00]: My adrenaline is through the roof right now.

249
00:15:00,849 --> 00:15:02,129
[SPEAKER_00]: Best feeling I've ever had in my life.

250
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:08,233
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and my friends are probably going to go and celebrate and this is going to hang in my house and that's how it's going to be.

251
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:11,975
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, you're going to hang the trophy in your house.

252
00:15:12,136 --> 00:15:14,417
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like the same type of trophy they give you for Little League.

253
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:15,653
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

254
00:15:18,215 --> 00:15:20,596
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's some comments from our chat room right now.

255
00:15:20,656 --> 00:15:21,037
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

256
00:15:21,997 --> 00:15:25,720
[SPEAKER_14]: Jaded2006 says, LOL, I can do max 300 stealth.

257
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:26,860
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

258
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,942
[SPEAKER_14]: Popanda21, I'm the only person in the world that's perfect.

259
00:15:33,044 --> 00:15:33,545
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

260
00:15:34,645 --> 00:15:35,466
[SPEAKER_14]: Sextastical.

261
00:15:35,566 --> 00:15:35,986
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

262
00:15:36,546 --> 00:15:37,047
[SPEAKER_14]: Where's the one?

263
00:15:37,127 --> 00:15:41,730
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody said something about... Oh, Illusion says, I could clean out my vagina with this guy.

264
00:15:44,888 --> 00:15:49,711
[SPEAKER_14]: Zaku says, oh, Zaku says, fuck you, man, try doing a ten-footer with six options, Extifer.

265
00:15:51,071 --> 00:15:52,072
[SPEAKER_14]: Ooh, burn.

266
00:15:52,772 --> 00:15:53,592
[SPEAKER_14]: He just threw down.

267
00:15:55,473 --> 00:15:56,794
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't fucking care.

268
00:15:56,814 --> 00:16:01,056
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, wait, did I cause controversy?

269
00:16:01,156 --> 00:16:01,816
[SPEAKER_12]: It's okay.

270
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:04,218
[SPEAKER_12]: Why don't you masturbate or something?

271
00:16:04,238 --> 00:16:04,418
[SPEAKER_12]: It's okay.

272
00:16:04,438 --> 00:16:10,661
[SPEAKER_13]: If they had, like, someone else in the tournament and he came in, like, third or second or something like that and how this interview would end.

273
00:16:11,897 --> 00:16:15,440
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I still don't think he's as cool as the guy who did DDR on crutches.

274
00:16:16,421 --> 00:16:16,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

275
00:16:17,081 --> 00:16:17,782
[SPEAKER_10]: The guy with one leg.

276
00:16:19,783 --> 00:16:21,224
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, you asked, we did.

277
00:16:21,304 --> 00:16:26,788
[SPEAKER_14]: We went ahead and talked about the video on the show.

278
00:16:26,849 --> 00:16:30,591
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if that's... For the record, I still think it's cheating.

279
00:16:32,173 --> 00:16:34,614
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if that's the response you wanted, buddy, but sorry.

280
00:16:34,634 --> 00:16:35,675
[SPEAKER_14]: We call him as we see him.

281
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:38,477
[SPEAKER_13]: I might add, his soft pad that he had at home is...

282
00:16:39,557 --> 00:16:43,039
[SPEAKER_13]: Red Octane, you know, Wannabe Pad.

283
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:44,379
[SPEAKER_13]: They look like crap.

284
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:45,580
[SPEAKER_14]: Skypline's open.

285
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,901
[SPEAKER_14]: Anybody want to call?

286
00:16:49,682 --> 00:16:51,803
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's just see who gets on there first.

287
00:16:58,566 --> 00:17:02,668
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm trying to wait for our British guy to call back because I promised we could get him on.

288
00:17:03,969 --> 00:17:06,490
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm kind of secretly hoping Zach will call back too.

289
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:14,924
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey Rob, I'm so awesome, I can pass every song, and I'm perfect.

290
00:17:14,944 --> 00:17:16,545
[SPEAKER_14]: Shut up, we got a call back.

291
00:17:16,585 --> 00:17:18,406
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

292
00:17:19,307 --> 00:17:19,927
[SPEAKER_14]: Simmel again.

293
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:21,108
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi Simmel, how you doing?

294
00:17:21,128 --> 00:17:22,108
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, no video this time.

295
00:17:22,148 --> 00:17:22,509
[SPEAKER_14]: That's alright.

296
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:23,669
[SPEAKER_14]: How you doing, Simmel?

297
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,071
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that should sort it out now.

298
00:17:26,531 --> 00:17:27,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, what's on your mind, buddy?

299
00:17:28,812 --> 00:17:30,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Just about the DDR Dancer.

300
00:17:30,493 --> 00:17:30,773
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh-huh.

301
00:17:32,615 --> 00:17:33,055
[SPEAKER_07]: What about him?

302
00:17:34,836 --> 00:17:36,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, just one thing.

303
00:17:41,205 --> 00:17:47,466
[SPEAKER_07]: When he's actually dancing and everything, why doesn't he just spend the $40 a day or whatever he's doing to buy a machine for home?

304
00:17:48,966 --> 00:17:49,687
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

305
00:17:49,707 --> 00:17:50,387
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a good question.

306
00:17:51,687 --> 00:17:55,488
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, you know, it's one of those impulse buy things.

307
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:56,368
[SPEAKER_14]: It's harder.

308
00:17:56,968 --> 00:18:03,989
[SPEAKER_14]: We could probably say the same thing about we pay $30 a month to do this radio show and at that rate we could have bought our own server by now.

309
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:04,570
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I mean?

310
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,630
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't really talk.

311
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:05,950
[SPEAKER_14]: I did.

312
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,691
[SPEAKER_10]: You built your own machine.

313
00:18:08,332 --> 00:18:15,980
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a difference between going out and spending $3,000 on a machine and spending... How much did you spend on yours?

314
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:15,980
$3,000.

315
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,103
[SPEAKER_13]: That was the exact same conclusion I came to.

316
00:18:19,123 --> 00:18:23,407
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, you know, I'm tired of playing an arcade where all the machines are broken, so I'm going to build my own.

317
00:18:23,627 --> 00:18:24,308
[SPEAKER_13]: And I did.

318
00:18:24,775 --> 00:18:31,724
[SPEAKER_12]: He doesn't get the recognition that he would get if he's playing it in front of people, so I think it's an arrogance thing, actually.

319
00:18:32,124 --> 00:18:33,226
[SPEAKER_12]: It's an ego thing.

320
00:18:34,087 --> 00:18:36,109
[SPEAKER_10]: He wants people around him to feed his ego.

321
00:18:36,129 --> 00:18:40,815
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's obvious that the way he was talking himself up, that he needed ego fodder.

322
00:18:40,835 --> 00:18:41,376
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

323
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,298
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm taking this with a grain of salt, because I think...

324
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:47,221
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the MTV guys might have embellished it a little bit.

325
00:18:47,241 --> 00:18:49,762
[SPEAKER_14]: Those words came out of his mouth.

326
00:18:50,022 --> 00:18:56,445
[SPEAKER_14]: That is true, but I know the power of editing and I think there could be something interesting going on here.

327
00:18:56,525 --> 00:18:58,707
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, what else is on your mind, Simmel?

328
00:19:00,107 --> 00:19:01,228
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty much about it, really.

329
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:04,430
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, well thank you so much for calling back and I'm sorry I didn't work out on the show earlier.

330
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,090
[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay.

331
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:07,091
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, have a good one, buddy.

332
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:08,252
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks a lot.

333
00:19:08,392 --> 00:19:09,012
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, bye-bye.

334
00:19:09,252 --> 00:19:10,373
[SPEAKER_14]: Bye.

335
00:19:10,393 --> 00:19:11,393
[SPEAKER_14]: And get some sleep soon.

336
00:19:12,654 --> 00:19:12,994
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

337
00:19:14,145 --> 00:19:14,986
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, did I hang up on him?

338
00:19:17,069 --> 00:19:17,469
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, whoop.

339
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,011
[SPEAKER_14]: I hung up on somebody else.

340
00:19:19,071 --> 00:19:19,371
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

341
00:19:19,872 --> 00:19:20,392
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, there we go.

342
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:22,074
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go to this call.

343
00:19:22,635 --> 00:19:23,736
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

344
00:19:24,608 --> 00:19:25,569
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's me.

345
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,013
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I guess it was a bad idea after all.

346
00:19:29,754 --> 00:19:30,655
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's alright.

347
00:19:30,715 --> 00:19:33,878
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I can understand the criticism, but that's okay.

348
00:19:33,898 --> 00:19:37,142
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you pretty much called it as you see it.

349
00:19:37,462 --> 00:19:41,266
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, play devil's advocate for me, Zaku, because have you met this guy being on the East Coast?

350
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,507
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I've met this guy.

351
00:19:42,567 --> 00:19:45,090
[SPEAKER_11]: I've hung out with this guy on several occasions.

352
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,412
[SPEAKER_11]: Was this a fair assessment of him?

353
00:19:47,325 --> 00:19:55,869
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, he's pretty much, I mean, if you get to know him, he doesn't sound very, he doesn't sound as arrogant as, you know, he doesn't sound, you know, he doesn't sound arrogant at all.

354
00:19:55,989 --> 00:19:58,070
[SPEAKER_13]: You really know how awesome I am.

355
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,051
[SPEAKER_11]: He's very humble.

356
00:19:59,171 --> 00:20:05,674
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just that, you know, when he gets the opportunity for these types of things, he tries to market himself.

357
00:20:06,354 --> 00:20:10,236
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, as I said, once you get to know him, he's pretty much very humble.

358
00:20:10,296 --> 00:20:16,639
[SPEAKER_11]: He just hates, you know, he doesn't care about what other people says because he doesn't feed into that negativity.

359
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:19,101
[SPEAKER_14]: But he knows how to strut his stuff on the catwalk, right?

360
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:23,303
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, because pretty much he put foot to ass to his skills.

361
00:20:23,443 --> 00:20:24,023
[SPEAKER_11]: Put it that way.

362
00:20:24,383 --> 00:20:26,464
[SPEAKER_11]: He didn't just magically get them.

363
00:20:26,484 --> 00:20:28,065
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a long way up there.

364
00:20:28,586 --> 00:20:29,446
[SPEAKER_11]: I can respect that.

365
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:32,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Four to five years of hard work trying to get up to that level.

366
00:20:33,648 --> 00:20:35,349
[SPEAKER_11]: And you don't do that by showing off.

367
00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:36,749
[SPEAKER_11]: You earn people's respect.

368
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:39,671
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, this guy doesn't win all the time.

369
00:20:39,751 --> 00:20:44,052
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you know, when he loses, he learns from his mistakes to get better.

370
00:20:44,713 --> 00:20:49,915
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, honestly, people like him are a prime example of what a DDR player should be.

371
00:20:52,156 --> 00:20:53,916
[SPEAKER_10]: I totally disagree with that.

372
00:20:54,617 --> 00:20:57,698
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, the best DDR player in the world can be complete jackasses.

373
00:20:57,898 --> 00:20:59,059
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what we're looking for.

374
00:20:59,099 --> 00:20:59,159
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

375
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,783
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't mean being an asshole or anything.

376
00:21:04,823 --> 00:21:09,387
[SPEAKER_11]: I just meant as someone who wouldn't blatantly show off.

377
00:21:09,407 --> 00:21:10,528
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone who's very humble.

378
00:21:11,829 --> 00:21:14,351
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure his dancing backwards and everything.

379
00:21:14,832 --> 00:21:17,714
[SPEAKER_10]: If he were truly that humble, he wouldn't be such a braggart.

380
00:21:18,995 --> 00:21:21,858
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you meet him in real life, he can prove that to you.

381
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:28,184
[SPEAKER_10]: But the thing is that he's making himself sound like he wins all the time, and you yourself said that he did not.

382
00:21:28,224 --> 00:21:29,525
[SPEAKER_11]: It depends.

383
00:21:29,925 --> 00:21:31,026
[SPEAKER_11]: He's one of the best.

384
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:35,010
[SPEAKER_10]: But he himself was saying he was the best.

385
00:21:36,107 --> 00:21:38,447
[SPEAKER_11]: Believe me, there are other people that are up to his level.

386
00:21:38,968 --> 00:21:40,348
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm from New York, I would know.

387
00:21:41,648 --> 00:21:47,589
[SPEAKER_14]: To Zachary, to be fair though, he did say in that video that he was bragging about being the best.

388
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:57,271
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm trying to give this guy a break because I understand that kind of energy that having an MTV person in your house can kind of give you.

389
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:59,312
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't get that sort of thing.

390
00:21:59,432 --> 00:22:01,112
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going to make yourself sound like the shit.

391
00:22:01,212 --> 00:22:01,992
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand that.

392
00:22:02,032 --> 00:22:03,653
[SPEAKER_12]: What happened to the Asian people?

393
00:22:03,693 --> 00:22:04,793
[SPEAKER_12]: Weren't they the best at it?

394
00:22:05,413 --> 00:22:08,057
[SPEAKER_12]: I honestly would like to see that guy versus Tigger.

395
00:22:24,145 --> 00:22:29,830
[SPEAKER_14]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

396
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:45,023
[SPEAKER_11]: and if willing, you probably will get the chance to interview him.

397
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,124
[SPEAKER_14]: Can't wait.

398
00:22:46,705 --> 00:22:47,366
[SPEAKER_14]: Can't wait.

399
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:48,947
[SPEAKER_14]: Can't wait to meet him.

400
00:22:49,188 --> 00:22:50,489
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, Zaku, have a good one.

401
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:51,810
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, later.

402
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:54,413
[SPEAKER_14]: We wanted to give you a fair counterpoint here on the program.

403
00:22:54,884 --> 00:23:01,890
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, I know some of you guys are trying to get in, but we're way past the three hours of our lives that we set aside for this program.

404
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,030
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're going to try and get back into it.

405
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,131
[SPEAKER_14]: We want to do the cage match.

406
00:23:04,692 --> 00:23:09,756
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe we'll open up Skype a little later because I saw some people calling in that weren't trying to call during the live show.

407
00:23:09,796 --> 00:23:11,837
[SPEAKER_14]: So I want to see if I can maybe get a couple of them.

408
00:23:12,037 --> 00:23:13,399
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I got to make a song.

409
00:23:14,318 --> 00:23:15,699
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, when are you going to make your stinking song?

410
00:23:15,899 --> 00:23:17,080
[SPEAKER_13]: I was working on it.

411
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:20,922
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a really bad thing with writer's block right now.

412
00:23:22,263 --> 00:23:23,504
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been trying to get past it.

413
00:23:23,744 --> 00:23:27,047
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been taking breaks from stuff and going back to it.

414
00:23:28,047 --> 00:23:29,108
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just not working.

415
00:23:30,389 --> 00:23:33,151
[SPEAKER_13]: So my thing is now is I'm going to make a song.

416
00:23:33,271 --> 00:23:34,552
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't care how crappy it is.

417
00:23:35,132 --> 00:23:43,938
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll submit it because I've got to do something so I can at least listen to the other songs so I can play them on show.

418
00:23:46,121 --> 00:23:49,403
[SPEAKER_14]: Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match

419
00:24:05,441 --> 00:24:07,141
[SPEAKER_14]: Three songs go into the cage match.

[SPEAKER_14]: And let's start off with a clip of last week's winner.

423
00:24:20,945 --> 00:24:23,186
[SPEAKER_14]: It was my pick, because I'm special.

424
00:24:23,266 --> 00:24:23,966
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, not really.

425
00:24:24,406 --> 00:24:25,586
[SPEAKER_14]: But you guys did vote for it.

426
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:30,348
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Deep Dish with a song named after the town where Orange Lounge Radio broadcasts from.

427
00:24:30,728 --> 00:24:31,688
[SPEAKER_14]: West Coast, yo.

428
00:24:31,728 --> 00:24:33,589
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Deep Dish with Sacramento.

429
00:24:33,689 --> 00:24:34,829
[SPEAKER_14]: Song number one tonight's cage match.

430

My losing hand Don't understand

431
00:25:51,664 --> 00:25:54,406
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, that was song number one in our cage match, Deep Dish with Sacramento.

432
00:25:54,446 --> 00:25:58,029
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's get into song number two, which comes to us courtesy of Loki.

433
00:25:58,089 --> 00:25:59,150
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, what'd you pick for us tonight?

434
00:25:59,631 --> 00:26:03,214
[SPEAKER_13]: I picked the song by, God, I don't remember who it's... Oh, by Quarter.

435
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:10,920
[SPEAKER_13]: He's the guy that did some stuff on diverse systems, and I want to say he might even be working on stuff now.

436
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,924
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a lot of those diverse system artists that crossed over to DJ Maxx and...

437
00:26:17,285 --> 00:26:17,786
[SPEAKER_13]: Ota Jam.

438
00:26:18,166 --> 00:26:21,911
[SPEAKER_13]: So he might be on one of the... on DJ Max, but I can't remember.

439
00:26:22,212 --> 00:26:31,624
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, this song's called Grand Parade, and I completely picked it out of random, so... Alright, we'll see if random picks are successful for Loki.

440
00:26:31,664 --> 00:26:32,745
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's song number two tonight.

441
00:26:33,066 --> 00:26:34,928
[SPEAKER_14]: Quarter with Grand Parade.

442
00:26:34,988 --> 00:26:35,229
[SPEAKER_14]: Enjoy.

443
00:28:25,743 --> 00:28:27,306
Thank you for watching!

444
00:32:49,318 --> 00:32:55,702
[SPEAKER_14]: I give the fact that it finally ended a 10.

445
00:32:55,742 --> 00:32:56,922
[SPEAKER_14]: Other than that, I give it a 3.

446
00:32:56,962 --> 00:33:01,325
[SPEAKER_14]: It was very repetitive, very boring, very... Is it ever over yet?

447
00:33:01,365 --> 00:33:01,565
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki,

448
00:33:20,148 --> 00:33:20,528
[SPEAKER_14]: I give it a 5.

449
00:33:20,848 --> 00:33:23,270
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually stopped listening to it after a while.

450
00:33:25,271 --> 00:33:30,333
[SPEAKER_14]: I also give that song a 5 because that song reminds me of something from 2DX 5th style.

451
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:35,236
[SPEAKER_14]: Like a very generic 2DX song spread out across about 25 minutes.

452
00:33:36,736 --> 00:33:37,817
[SPEAKER_14]: Xtofer, you want to rate that song?

453
00:33:40,058 --> 00:33:42,379
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't remember it.

454
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,041
[SPEAKER_12]: So I give it a 0.

455
00:33:47,281 --> 00:33:51,804
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, kids, DarkSakura has a chance to redeem, I guess, a little bit here.

456
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:53,625
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow, we all panned that one.

457
00:33:53,665 --> 00:33:55,387
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, what do you think of song three?

458
00:33:55,527 --> 00:33:56,007
[SPEAKER_14]: What's coming up?

459
00:33:56,207 --> 00:33:59,149
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a group, I believe they're from the Bay Area, called Babyland.

460
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:05,914
[SPEAKER_10]: They are sort of a synth-industrial pop punk.

461
00:34:06,735 --> 00:34:07,755
[SPEAKER_10]: They do some of everything.

462
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:11,478
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, their drum kit is like metal tubs and pipes.

463
00:34:12,178 --> 00:34:13,219
[SPEAKER_10]: They're really amazing.

464
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:15,461
[SPEAKER_10]: The song is called Jerry, I think is how it's pronounced.

465
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:15,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

466
00:34:17,202 --> 00:34:20,484
[SPEAKER_10]: And actually there's a video for this that's up on their website too, but they're just fantastic.

467
00:34:20,504 --> 00:34:22,966
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to see them in Berkeley on the 15th next month.

468
00:34:23,206 --> 00:34:24,067
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's an indie band.

469
00:34:24,347 --> 00:34:24,588
[SPEAKER_10]: Indie.

470
00:34:24,828 --> 00:34:26,989
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, I go indie as often as I can.

471
00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:29,091
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, here it is, song number three, Babyland.

472
00:34:29,271 --> 00:34:29,992
[SPEAKER_14]: Jerry, enjoy.

473
00:36:50,624 --> 00:36:51,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't tell me I'm

474
00:38:54,005 --> 00:39:03,550
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, that was song number three in tonight's cage match.

475
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,851
[SPEAKER_14]: Babyland with Jerry.

476
00:39:04,891 --> 00:39:06,552
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go around and see what the folks thought of that.

477
00:39:06,612 --> 00:39:07,273
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura.

478
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:09,334
[SPEAKER_10]: Ten, and I'm going to see them next month.

479
00:39:09,354 --> 00:39:09,974
[SPEAKER_10]: That rocks.

480
00:39:11,055 --> 00:39:11,395
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki.

481
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,557
[SPEAKER_13]: Eh, I don't know.

482
00:39:13,717 --> 00:39:14,037
[SPEAKER_13]: Seven.

483
00:39:14,777 --> 00:39:14,917
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

484
00:39:14,957 --> 00:39:15,097
[SPEAKER_12]: Extifer.

485
00:39:15,398 --> 00:39:15,778
[SPEAKER_12]: Extifer.

486
00:39:19,124 --> 00:39:20,025
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't been paying attention.

487
00:39:20,706 --> 00:39:22,028
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, no, it was good.

488
00:39:22,088 --> 00:39:22,609
[SPEAKER_12]: I liked it.

489
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:24,111
[SPEAKER_12]: It was better than the last one.

490
00:39:24,131 --> 00:39:24,512
[SPEAKER_12]: Seven.

491
00:39:27,842 --> 00:39:29,603
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I like the music.

492
00:39:29,663 --> 00:39:35,268
[SPEAKER_14]: It kind of sounds like the Postal Service, but like, I don't know, like a little more hardcore, which is pretty cool.

493
00:39:36,188 --> 00:39:38,450
[SPEAKER_14]: The vocalist was a little screamy for me, though.

494
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:40,151
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't like the screamy guys.

495
00:39:40,171 --> 00:39:42,033
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

496
00:39:42,093 --> 00:39:42,633
[SPEAKER_14]: Not my thing.

497
00:39:43,634 --> 00:39:44,335
[SPEAKER_14]: But I like the music.

498
00:39:44,355 --> 00:39:45,315
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought musically it was good.

499
00:39:45,415 --> 00:39:47,797
[SPEAKER_14]: So I give the music a nine.

500
00:39:47,857 --> 00:39:49,959
[SPEAKER_14]: I give the singing a little less.

501
00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:52,681
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think I'll give it a seven and a half overall.

502
00:39:53,775 --> 00:39:57,336
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, so let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight.

503
00:39:57,456 --> 00:40:01,457
[SPEAKER_14]: Here we go, starting off with song number one, Deep Dish with Sacramento.

504
00:40:03,198 --> 00:40:09,239
[SPEAKER_06]: And song number two you can vote for tonight is Quarter with Grand Parade.

505
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,841
[SPEAKER_14]: Imagine that for about five minutes.

506
00:40:21,881 --> 00:40:24,583
[SPEAKER_14]: Song number three is Babyland with Jerry.

507
00:40:24,763 --> 00:40:25,344
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, Loki.

508
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:34,552
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, guys.

509
00:40:34,792 --> 00:40:36,974
[SPEAKER_14]: Place vote now.

510
00:40:37,074 --> 00:40:44,280
[SPEAKER_14]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote, and we shall reveal the winner a little later in the program.

511
00:40:45,848 --> 00:40:47,169
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, damn, we're running really late tonight.

512
00:40:47,189 --> 00:40:48,569
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been on air for three and a half hours now.

513
00:40:48,589 --> 00:40:49,089
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you believe that?

514
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:49,870
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

515
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:52,051
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like the old days when we did the podcast after.

516
00:40:52,151 --> 00:40:53,932
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, but we just had a lot to say tonight.

517
00:40:54,092 --> 00:40:54,872
[SPEAKER_14]: Pretty crazy, I guess.

518
00:40:54,912 --> 00:40:56,713
[SPEAKER_10]: We're some chatty, chatty people.

519
00:40:56,773 --> 00:40:57,073
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right.

520
00:40:57,113 --> 00:40:58,454
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, what the hell are you doing online over there?

521
00:40:58,474 --> 00:40:59,874
[SPEAKER_14]: I see you doing something game-related.

522
00:40:59,914 --> 00:41:01,555
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't see what she's doing, but I can see what you're doing.

523
00:41:02,075 --> 00:41:05,956
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just looking up the achievements for Ridge Racer 6.

524
00:41:06,516 --> 00:41:07,176
[SPEAKER_14]: They're hard.

525
00:41:07,377 --> 00:41:08,537
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't remember where they are.

526
00:41:08,557 --> 00:41:15,899
[SPEAKER_14]: You know most games give you one really easy achievement, like power on the game and kill one monster and you get five points.

527
00:41:16,699 --> 00:41:17,919
[SPEAKER_14]: Ridge Racer don't give you any of that.

528
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:20,020
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to like 360 and you get five points.

529
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,526
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't even... I thought I did a 360, but I guess that's just my car spinning around a lot because I hit a wall.

530
00:41:25,926 --> 00:41:28,149
[SPEAKER_14]: I finally broke the barrier in Ridge Racer.

531
00:41:28,189 --> 00:41:30,111
[SPEAKER_14]: I was able to beat the first race, finally.

532
00:41:30,592 --> 00:41:33,915
[SPEAKER_14]: And then, like, after beating the first race, I was able to clear, like, ten races.

533
00:41:34,256 --> 00:41:34,916
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, really easy.

534
00:41:35,297 --> 00:41:36,338
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I don't know.

535
00:41:36,378 --> 00:41:38,841
[SPEAKER_14]: I finally got over my Ridge Racer handicap, I guess.

536
00:41:39,537 --> 00:41:42,478
[SPEAKER_14]: What is that about Splinter Cell or Ghost Recon?

537
00:41:42,498 --> 00:41:43,798
[SPEAKER_13]: It says it only has 925 achievement points.

538
00:41:43,818 --> 00:41:44,198
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought it had 1,000.

539
00:41:44,238 --> 00:41:45,318
[SPEAKER_13]: No, every game has 1,000 except that one for some reason.

540
00:41:45,338 --> 00:41:45,698
[SPEAKER_13]: That has 925.

541
00:41:45,758 --> 00:41:46,279
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know why.

542
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:47,479
[SPEAKER_13]: You got robbed to 75 points somewhere.

543
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:47,679
[SPEAKER_13]: Stupid.

544
00:41:47,699 --> 00:41:49,459
[SPEAKER_13]: So I have 1,340 out of 14,625 based on what I own.

545
00:42:05,325 --> 00:42:07,666
[SPEAKER_14]: And you have a perfect 1000 in full auto now, huh?

546
00:42:07,686 --> 00:42:09,566
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I have the full autos finished.

547
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:11,667
[SPEAKER_13]: 50 out of 50 for that.

548
00:42:11,727 --> 00:42:12,167
[SPEAKER_14]: Good job.

549
00:42:12,327 --> 00:42:20,910
[SPEAKER_13]: But, like, there's games I bought, you know, now, at the time at launch, you know, I thought, oh, those are going to be really cool games, you know, like Perfect Dark Zero.

550
00:42:22,651 --> 00:42:25,152
[SPEAKER_13]: And I haven't played, I've played that twice.

551
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,673
[SPEAKER_14]: I couldn't get into Perfect Dark Zero.

552
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:29,853
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand where people are, like, totally loving this game.

553
00:42:30,034 --> 00:42:30,494
[SPEAKER_14]: I couldn't do it.

554
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:31,094
[SPEAKER_10]: I liked the club...

555
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:34,827
[SPEAKER_10]: I liked the club level in that game.

556
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:37,528
[SPEAKER_10]: That really was the most fun level to me.

557
00:42:37,948 --> 00:42:39,789
[SPEAKER_10]: But I can't play it because I get motion sick.

558
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:43,251
[SPEAKER_14]: I play mostly the arcade games.

559
00:42:43,291 --> 00:42:45,812
[SPEAKER_14]: Most of my achievements are little 200-pointer games.

560
00:42:46,432 --> 00:42:48,193
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I have a lot of the arcade games.

561
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:50,274
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's the ones I've got to play through.

562
00:42:50,814 --> 00:42:52,875
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm planning on selling some of this stuff back.

563
00:42:53,275 --> 00:42:58,077
[SPEAKER_13]: Full auto, I'm debating whether I want to sell it back because I do like the game, but I'm kind of done with it.

564
00:42:58,297 --> 00:42:59,018
[SPEAKER_13]: There really isn't...

565
00:43:00,038 --> 00:43:07,443
[SPEAKER_13]: Multiplayer-wise, it's only two-player and there's not really any good deathmatch type stuff for it.

566
00:43:08,023 --> 00:43:11,805
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I'm thinking I'm probably just going to sell that one back.

567
00:43:13,927 --> 00:43:20,011
[SPEAKER_13]: But the other games I want to blaster real quick, The Outfit, I need to go through that real quick because it's a cool game, but...

568
00:43:21,738 --> 00:43:23,899
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, I just haven't really played it online.

569
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:34,185
[SPEAKER_13]: Call of Duty 2, I'm kind of getting tired of that game, so I need to finish the whole game on, I guess, Veteran, which should be freaking hard.

570
00:43:34,765 --> 00:43:38,607
[SPEAKER_13]: And Ghost Recon, eh, I just need to play that more.

571
00:43:38,727 --> 00:43:40,308
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll be, I think, a lot more fun.

572
00:43:41,329 --> 00:43:46,491
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, Need for Speed Most Wanted, that game looked kind of lame, so I just have to go through that.

573
00:43:47,032 --> 00:43:51,034
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I need the Barrier Cameo, because I started achieving points on that, and I sold mine back.

574
00:43:51,874 --> 00:43:52,475
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, you can borrow that.

575
00:43:52,695 --> 00:43:55,237
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to play Burnout, so we'll make a little trade or something.

576
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:56,418
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe Amp 3 or something.

577
00:43:56,438 --> 00:43:58,861
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I'm on rank.

578
00:43:59,021 --> 00:44:00,582
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, do you have Amp 3 with you?

579
00:44:00,883 --> 00:44:02,144
[SPEAKER_14]: I had Amp 3.

580
00:44:02,364 --> 00:44:02,705
[SPEAKER_14]: Damn you.

581
00:44:02,925 --> 00:44:03,145
[SPEAKER_13]: Why?

582
00:44:03,525 --> 00:44:05,287
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to play more games.

583
00:44:05,307 --> 00:44:08,050
[SPEAKER_13]: I sold it back, but I'm going to probably buy it again.

584
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:08,550
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

585
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:13,775
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it actually, for those who might not know that out there, it dropped in price to $39.99.

586
00:44:14,236 --> 00:44:14,936
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, that's cool.

587
00:44:14,996 --> 00:44:16,438
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you can find it,

588
00:44:17,691 --> 00:44:18,832
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

589
00:44:34,878 --> 00:44:35,759
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, sure.

590
00:44:36,439 --> 00:44:37,400
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a cool game.

591
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,440
[SPEAKER_14]: Something you're not playing a lot of.

592
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:38,980
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a cool game.

593
00:44:39,021 --> 00:44:42,022
[SPEAKER_13]: I just haven't really gotten into it yet.

594
00:44:42,202 --> 00:44:42,483
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

595
00:44:43,083 --> 00:44:43,443
[SPEAKER_14]: That'd be cool.

596
00:44:43,803 --> 00:44:44,084
[SPEAKER_14]: Sweet.

597
00:44:44,524 --> 00:44:46,065
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I want to get some more achievement points, too.

598
00:44:46,085 --> 00:44:48,866
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel like achievement point whoring it up a little bit.

599
00:44:48,906 --> 00:44:50,307
[SPEAKER_13]: I swear to God, that shit is crack.

600
00:44:50,788 --> 00:44:51,008
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it?

601
00:44:51,108 --> 00:44:53,029
[SPEAKER_14]: It gets me to buy games I wouldn't normally buy.

602
00:44:53,069 --> 00:44:55,891
[SPEAKER_14]: See, that's Microsoft's got you by the balls.

603
00:44:56,491 --> 00:44:56,751
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

604
00:44:58,552 --> 00:45:01,834
[SPEAKER_13]: To be honest, I do buy games just for this show to talk about them.

605
00:45:02,194 --> 00:45:02,654
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

606
00:45:02,755 --> 00:45:04,175
[SPEAKER_14]: I find that to be my weakness too.

607
00:45:04,215 --> 00:45:05,156
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, I was just commenting.

608
00:45:05,476 --> 00:45:11,639
[SPEAKER_14]: We were in Fry's the other day and I was just commenting to somebody that like, oh my god, I started buying a lot more games when we started doing this program.

609
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:12,780
[SPEAKER_14]: It's bad.

610
00:45:13,821 --> 00:45:15,522
[SPEAKER_14]: Just to give me more to talk about on the program.

611
00:45:15,822 --> 00:45:17,903
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to get gaming companies to send them to us for free.

612
00:45:17,963 --> 00:45:20,124
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that should be our mission at E3 this year.

613
00:45:20,324 --> 00:45:21,325
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm selling them at work.

614
00:45:21,505 --> 00:45:23,346
[SPEAKER_13]: We're supposed to be getting them sent to us, but...

615
00:45:24,066 --> 00:45:27,507
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry if I offended anybody tonight.

616
00:45:27,547 --> 00:45:32,529
[SPEAKER_13]: I just thought I would be a little bit gentleman-like and say that.

617
00:45:34,469 --> 00:45:35,009
[SPEAKER_14]: Extend my apologies.

618
00:45:49,136 --> 00:45:50,817
[SPEAKER_12]: Babyland Tower to the indie band

619
00:46:17,938 --> 00:46:20,719
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, with the screaming guy.

620
00:46:22,039 --> 00:46:27,701
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, a lot of their other stuff is a lot more industrial sounding, you know, so his screaming does fit.

621
00:46:27,741 --> 00:46:31,222
[SPEAKER_10]: But that one, I actually thought that you would like that one for the synth poppy.

622
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:32,263
[SPEAKER_14]: I do, I like the music.

623
00:46:32,283 --> 00:46:32,903
[SPEAKER_14]: I love the music.

624
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:34,403
[SPEAKER_14]: The guy's voice is a little wacky.

625
00:46:34,443 --> 00:46:37,284
[SPEAKER_10]: They have a MySpace up that's got more of their stuff on there.

626
00:46:37,524 --> 00:46:38,005
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll check it out.

627
00:46:38,025 --> 00:46:38,565
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of MySpace...

628
00:46:39,485 --> 00:46:41,406
[SPEAKER_14]: Speaking of Myspace, we're on Myspace.

629
00:46:41,707 --> 00:46:42,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we are.

630
00:46:42,187 --> 00:46:42,787
[SPEAKER_14]: We love Myspace.

631
00:46:43,127 --> 00:46:43,448
[SPEAKER_14]: Get this.

632
00:46:43,768 --> 00:46:44,989
[SPEAKER_14]: Echo Image has a Myspace.

633
00:46:45,129 --> 00:46:47,490
[SPEAKER_14]: The singer from Echo Image freaking commented on my Myspace.

634
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:50,032
[SPEAKER_14]: That made me such a screaming little girl earlier this week.

635
00:46:50,472 --> 00:46:51,793
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, seriously, that's so cool.

636
00:46:52,093 --> 00:46:52,614
[SPEAKER_14]: So check that.

637
00:46:52,694 --> 00:46:53,755
[SPEAKER_14]: Echo Image is on Myspace.

638
00:46:54,455 --> 00:46:55,476
[SPEAKER_14]: Zoic is on Myspace as well.

639
00:46:55,496 --> 00:46:57,097
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm trying to think of other DDR bands I saw on there.

640
00:46:57,597 --> 00:46:57,877
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

641
00:46:57,897 --> 00:46:59,058
[SPEAKER_14]: But Orange Lounge Radio is on there too.

642
00:46:59,598 --> 00:46:59,919
[SPEAKER_14]: It's what?

643
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,120
[SPEAKER_14]: Myspace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, I think.

644
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,841
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's clips of our show.

645
00:47:03,881 --> 00:47:06,483
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'll probably put the Chocobo clip up from tonight because that was pretty funny.

646
00:47:06,503 --> 00:47:09,225
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll link the Myspace in our LiveJournal community.

647
00:47:10,085 --> 00:47:12,407
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we posted there before, but we need more people to join.

648
00:47:12,547 --> 00:47:13,508
[SPEAKER_14]: We only have 50 friends.

649
00:47:13,548 --> 00:47:14,929
[SPEAKER_14]: I know there's more than that listening to the show.

650
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,871
[SPEAKER_14]: We're being total MySpace whores now, but we will not spam.

651
00:47:18,652 --> 00:47:19,512
[SPEAKER_14]: We might leave comments.

652
00:47:19,552 --> 00:47:23,815
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to say that 50 in the first couple of weeks of being up is not bad at all.

653
00:47:24,115 --> 00:47:26,137
[SPEAKER_14]: We might leave comments that says thank you.

654
00:47:26,397 --> 00:47:30,640
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to come up with some funny MySpace pictures, so maybe we'll work on that this week and leave you guys some comments.

655
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:35,543
[SPEAKER_14]: But we will not send random messages to people saying, hey, you're a fan of such and such.

656
00:47:35,583 --> 00:47:36,704
[SPEAKER_14]: You should listen to Orange Lingerie.

657
00:47:36,764 --> 00:47:37,445
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I hate that shit.

658
00:47:37,845 --> 00:47:38,746
[SPEAKER_14]: I always report that stuff.

659
00:47:39,006 --> 00:47:40,288
[SPEAKER_14]: I always flag it for spam abuse.

660
00:47:41,449 --> 00:47:44,331
[SPEAKER_14]: We might comment on your MySpaces, though.

661
00:47:44,371 --> 00:47:46,514
[SPEAKER_14]: If you don't like us commenting on your MySpace, you can delete it.

662
00:47:46,534 --> 00:47:47,174
[SPEAKER_14]: We won't be offended.

663
00:47:47,495 --> 00:47:48,115
[SPEAKER_14]: But we're going to comment.

664
00:47:48,796 --> 00:47:50,958
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's it.

665
00:47:51,038 --> 00:47:56,063
[SPEAKER_14]: I know we have chatroom FUs to do, too, but honestly, I kind of want to just wrap it up.

666
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:00,980
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I need to go.

667
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:01,841
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, one more thing.

668
00:48:02,081 --> 00:48:05,643
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, chat room, but we know you're angsty too, but we'll just have to get that in another time.

669
00:48:06,124 --> 00:48:08,545
[SPEAKER_14]: So just yell them out real quick in the chat room.

670
00:48:09,766 --> 00:48:13,228
[SPEAKER_10]: Do an FU post on our LiveJournal community.

671
00:48:13,309 --> 00:48:13,729
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

672
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:16,250
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, that's going to do it for now, though.

673
00:48:16,331 --> 00:48:17,131
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I need to check.

674
00:48:17,651 --> 00:48:21,754
[SPEAKER_14]: During the cage match, I actually ran out and took a picture of my Xbox with the Mario background.

675
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:24,796
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to try and upload that to the forums if the picture finally posted here.

676
00:48:24,836 --> 00:48:27,258
[SPEAKER_14]: So look for that on our forums a little later.

677
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:29,680
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sleepy That's light!

678
00:48:42,974 --> 00:48:44,395
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm gonna go home and play Ragnar Crack online.

679
00:48:44,415 --> 00:48:46,056
[SPEAKER_14]: No, because I've eaten plenty of food today.

680
00:48:46,116 --> 00:48:48,178
[SPEAKER_14]: I had a piece of cheesecake for freakin' breakfast.

681
00:48:48,198 --> 00:48:49,999
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it was six-carp cheesecake from Cheesecake Factory.

682
00:48:50,039 --> 00:48:50,660
[SPEAKER_10]: That stuff is crack.

683

[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura

684
00:49:35,686 --> 00:49:38,128
[SPEAKER_14]: My final thought is streaming media.

685
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:49,278
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, how am I going to fit in playing games, making music, have to work on a webpage, have to work on the other webpage, and life?

686
00:49:51,439 --> 00:49:52,400
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, thank you for that downer.

687
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,242
[SPEAKER_12]: Extifer, your final thought.

688
00:49:56,075 --> 00:49:56,495
[SPEAKER_12]: Who is this superhero?
