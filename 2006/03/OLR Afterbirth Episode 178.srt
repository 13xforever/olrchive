1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,360
Alright, we're back here with the Afterbirth, and you know, I think this might be one of

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,120
the longest shows on the records for us here at Orange Laundry.

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,360
We're almost already to 9 o'clock, so kind of interesting.

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,600
Alright, so we've got a lot of stuff we want to cover here in the Afterbirth.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,320
Let's go ahead and start off with a little bit of how was your week, how was your day,

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,440
really quickly go around and see what's going on in our personal lives.

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,320
Remember, the afterbirth, this is the portion that is absolutely dearly special to those

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,340
of you guys listening live here on OrangeLawnsRadio.com.

9
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,020
We don't podcast it.

10
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,420
In fact, some people bootleg it.

11
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,860
I don't know why.

12
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:39,860
We don't talk about games at all.

13
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,100
We talk about us.

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,100
What's going on?

15
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,660
DarkSakura, how was your week, how was your day?

16
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:49,500
Being the diva that I am, I slept until noon today and then went to the grocery store.

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,260
Other than that, I sprained my wrist last Friday, which I might have mentioned on the

18
00:00:54,260 --> 00:01:01,260
the show because my cat was being a retard and I was leaning over to pet her

19
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,740
and balancing myself on the the chair as I was getting up and she bumped into my

20
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:10,880
leg not me just enough off balance so my wrist is a little sore now it's actually

21
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,260
better but I couldn't play anything all week except Ragnarok it really got on my

22
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:21,300
nerves however you know I did play a lot of Ragnarok I also I have homework that

23
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:28,500
I've been putting off all week that I didn't do today. Good job. Yeah, I'm really responsible.

24
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,680
So it's going to be turned in late. And, uh, really that's about it. I've just had a very

25
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,240
busy week. All right. Uh, Xtaphir, how was your week? How was your day? Uh, the week

26
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:47,060
was fine. I, um, I was sick a couple days out of the week, but it's, it's already passed

27
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:54,940
and everything. I went back to Final Fantasy XI after you guys all went back and I decided

28
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:59,100
okay well I'll try a different character. So I'm not a white mage anymore and I'm not

29
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:06,900
a black mage anymore, I'm a thief. So yay, thieves. Because you know what, I play a rogue

30
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:12,140
in World of Warcraft and it's pretty much the same thing. Anyways, and then today I

31
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,560
had a good time with my boyfriend, actually I had a really good time with my boyfriend

32
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:24,440
whole weekend and yay shut up and we went into the video games live on friday which was cool so yeah

33
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:34,120
so yay boyfriend loki how was your week how was your day um my week is okay um

34
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,960
what did i do this week shit um well now i don't think i did anything too important i did play

35
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:48,720
more oblivion. That was fun. And tomorrow I'm supposed to be going to get a marriage

36
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,400
license, and so I'm actually taking the day off, and that's only gonna take about half

37
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,040
an hour, but I have to drive up to Placerville, and that's like, what, like an hour, not an

38
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,120
hour away, but like 30 minutes away. And no one likes going to Placerville, it's like,

39
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,040
you know, I don't...

40
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,040
It's just not allowed there. There's not a lot there.

41
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,040
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

42
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,040
Oh, and of course we went down to San Jose and that was fun.

43
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,040
And that was really cool.

44
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,040
Now I gotta mention though, when we were at Genji,

45
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,040
it is basically your Benihana's type of restaurant.

46
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,040
It's a teppanyaki.

47
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,360
Yeah, where they, you know, cook in front of you.

48
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,360
But they did...

49
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,520
Benny Hana's does this thing where they make, like, a volcano out of the onions.

50
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:46,720
Now Genji took it one step further that put them on top, as far as the onion section goes,

51
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,720
with me.

52
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,660
And that would be that they took the onion, and they made a little volcano, and they poured

53
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,720
the water in there, and then it caused the scene, ooh, a volcano.

54
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,040
Well then he took, you know, alcohol, poured the alcohol in there, and lit it on fire.

55
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,940
And that was freaking sweet.

56
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,420
They do that at another place in town called Katana.

57
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,020
Well, I don't care.

58
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:14,520
Wow. This is just cool.

59
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,500
Other than that, no, I didn't do too much else.

60
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,180
My week and my day was okay. I was still really sick this week

61
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,020
with my sinus infection. It just kind of kept me down for a little while and I didn't

62
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,460
really get to go to the gym at all, which kind of pissed me off, but

63
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,020
I'm better now. Yesterday was my first day with zero meds, zero anything, so I

64
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:37,100
feel much better now thank you very much and otherwise just been try been doing a

65
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,300
lot of gaming because you know just everything on the 360 and the DS and

66
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:47,300
Final Fantasy and all that stuff good times and I guess I Tuesday we already

67
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,540

72
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:26,080
So Extrofer, what did you, oh wait, oh wait, I almost forgot. Sorry. I have to get your theme music.

73
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,080
Oh god.

74
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,080
Extrofer's movie review! What movie did you see this week?

75
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,080
V for Vendetta.

76
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,080
Alright, how was it?

77
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:43,080
And it was very well done. I really liked it. First of all, when we went into the theater I was really wanting to see the Snakes on a Plane preview.

78
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:48,300
because you know that's just really funny but um and I also want to get the

79
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,860
t-shirt that has the snakes and then plus plane equals snakes on okay when I

80
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,900
mentioned snakes on the plane to you you were like what is that that's stupid

81
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:03,900
well I still think it's stupid I think everybody yeah yeah and I want to see it

82
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:11,420
now but the movie itself it was really well done it really has a lot of

83
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:18,380
important issues in it that I think kind of pertain to today's current events and

84
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,520
everything and I think everybody should see it I think it's better than the

85
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,940
matrix is from the people who brought out the matrix and I wasn't a big fan of

86
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:30,500
the matrix but I really liked this movie a lot I think it's one of the best

87
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:36,820
movies I've seen this year two thumbs up yeah two big dicks up all right thank

88
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:48,760
you. Two snakes up. All right. Let's see. I mentioned there on the Skype line earlier.

89
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,240
Well first off, we're going to open it back up very soon here, but on the Skype line earlier,

90
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,480
we told one of our callers that we would actually take a look at this live on air. So I'm going

91
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:04,260
to try and pull this up here. Let's see if I can locate the file. It says MTV. Okay,

92
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,660
Here we go, so this is that MTV interview.

93
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,220
We haven't done Orange Lawn's Radio at the Movies in a long time.

94
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:13,400
So we have this MTV interview with Sketch, who's a DDR player.

95
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,760
Keep in mind, usually when we do Orange Lawn's Radio at the Movies, we have a chance to watch

96
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,480
this clip in advance and kind of prep what we want to say, but tonight, not the case.

97
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,140
So we're just going to watch this to see how it goes.

98
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,140
So here it is.

99
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,860
Dance Dance Revolution expert Anthony spends insane hours training for tournaments like

100
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,300
the one we're about to show you.

101
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,860
Now kids, I'm warning you, you try this at home and you're going to watch your knees

102
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,800
buckle and your ankles snap.

103
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,800
Now wait, hold on a minute. Isn't DDR something that's designed to be played at home?

104
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,800
Kids! I'm gonna warn ya! I'm stupid!

105
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,800
Okay, well I'm guessing that he's saying that because this guy

106
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,800
is going to do some insane tricks here. Guys, I apologize for the volume on this video

107
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,800
but the video volume is insanely low. I have it jacked up as high as it'll go, so

108
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,800
you'll just have to deal here for a little bit. Anyway, let's move on. Let's see what is so

109
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,800
frickin' insane about this.

110
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:15,680
bar-humping

111
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,400
well yes kids kids do not allow yourselves to bar rape at home because

112
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,200
that's what they're doing in this little clip right now is they're bar raping

113
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,680
because they don't rape the couch bar raping by the way for you non DDR folks

114
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,280
it's when you hold on to the bar while you play which is not dancing

115
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,600
I'm sorry that's not dancing. Well neither is DDR technically. Well I know.

116
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,720
But you know what, when you play doubles and some of that freestyle stuff you see now

117
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,600
that's dancing. Bar raping is not dancing.

118
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:45,600
Anyway moving on. For most of us Dance Dance Revolution is something you do for fun.

119
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,560
But for Anthony Carella here, the New York City DDR champion, quite possibly the best in the world,

120
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,280
this is really serious business. Seriously. I bet about,

121
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,760
no offense to this guy, I don't know him, but I bet there's about 50 people on the

122
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,280
internet waiting to dispute this claim.

123
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,600
and you know that there's people jealous that this guy got TV time

124
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,680
we know what it's not like you know she's

125
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,120
MTV doing actual research on something

126
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,360
now yeah okay anyway I am in no and I'm not gonna doubt this guy's good I've

127
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,180
never seen I'm just gonna say there are going to be 50 people lined up

128
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:21,180
wanting to dispute that claim that's all I'm saying

129
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,080
I just started playing about four years ago

130
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,520
I found like solace in the game because I had a breakup with my girlfriend

131
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,920
And it's a dick thing, man. I can't stop playing. I just love playing it.

132
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,600
Okay, I'm sorry. That's lame. He's playing. Not his reasoning.

133
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,720
They made him play DDR while he's being interviewed. That is

134
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,760
that is the ultimate in cheeseball. I'm sorry. Really stupid.

135
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,200
Whoever attributed MTV with doing anything really intelligent

136
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,880
other than remote control. Sometimes me and my friends would wake up at nine

137
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,360
o'clock, go down to Coney Island, play all day.

138
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,400
Go home at eight o'clock, wake up, do it again. We would do it for about a week.

139
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:01,000
it usually runs me not even gonna lie about 20 to 40 bucks every time i go to the arcade

140
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,880
which by the way you'll notice this guy is one of the skinniest people i've ever seen in my

141
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:11,880
life and that's why right there that is a look at that he is skinny very very skinny

142
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,640
from about 2003 to 2004 i was undefeated in all new york city fair options tournaments

143
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,080
Yeah, that's because you're on the East Coast.

144
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,880
Oh! Burned. I'm just teasing.

145
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,320
Here comes all the hate mail from the East Coast. This guy, you asshole.

146
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,720
I'm teasing. It's a joke. I'm just starting shit.

147
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,600
I take pride in saying that I'm one of the few people, if not the only person in the world, that can stealth

148
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,360
every hard 10-footer in the game backwards. Meaning I could do it without looking or I could turn the arrows on.

149
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,520
Well, let me put it this way. If you can stealth it going forward, you can stealth it backwards.

150
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,520
Sorry, I restarted the video.

151
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,800
No, sorry.

152
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,600
And, it's a dick thing, man. I can't stop playing, I just can't.

153
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,840
Sorry, you gotta hear some of it over again, cause I fucked up.

154
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,160
Sometimes me and my friends would wake up at 9 o'clock, go down to Coney Island, play all day.

155
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:09,520
I used to wake up, or not wake up, I used to go, like, after midnight, go down to CCL and play until 3 in the morning.

156
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,480
That is pretty hardcore.

157
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,600
Okay, here comes the stealth line again.

158
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:20,600
From about 2003 to 2004, I was undefeated in all New York City fair options tournaments.

159
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,800
I take pride in saying that I'm one of the few people, if not the only person in the

160
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,800
world that can stealth every hard 10-footer in the game backwards, meaning I could do

161
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,300
it without looking or I could turn the arrows off.

162
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,120
That just takes some insane memorization.

163
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,280
I mean, you really do have to play the game a lot to know those songs, you know, like

164
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,280
the back of your hand.

165
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,960
active repetition. Didn't you say you played so much love on DDR second mix that you

166
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:52,720
could do the same thing? Yeah. Yeah. I used to do that Dynamite Rage. It's Dynamite Rave by

167
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,520
the way I don't know I don't know if you've ever played the song before. God it's been that long

168
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:01,000
since I've played I actually forgot the title. You remember who was it Enrique who used to play

169
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:09,200
with us when he and I would play um love to me backwards just repetition. I'm sorry I don't know

170
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,920
this whole thing what's all about cuz I've been playing Tetris but I just

171
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,400
heard him say that and everything and I'm like it takes somebody so arrogant

172
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,920
and so full of themselves to say that I'm like the only person in the world

173
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,940
who can do this because I'm pretty sure he's not to this guy's credit though MTV

174
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,820
is probably coaxing this out of him you know what I mean like I I know these

175
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:33,120
interview people can be sometimes and it he's probably I don't know I don't know

176
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,120
this guy so I'm not going to assume anything.

177
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,120
I work out. I'm not working out to get fit. I'm working out to see if I can get a better score on a song.

178
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,120
I'm not listening to music. I'm thinking of ways that I can get better and do things better.

179
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:55,120
Alright dude, so you have a huge tournament coming up. The huge championship, right?

180
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,120
You can't train 24 hours a day in an arcade. So what do you do? How are you prepping at home?

181
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:07,480
I got the pad at home. I'm playing on the pad. I also have these step charts that I'm

182
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,560
looking at. They're step charts of the hardest songs in the game, cheat sheets if you want

183
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,940
to call them. I'm looking at those patterns and I'm trying to figure out what I'm going

184
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,080
to use on people, what I'm not going to use on people. I'm trying to get my confidence

185
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,000
up because it's not only a physical thing, it's a mental thing.

186
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,680
You think you're going to win this tournament?

187
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,680
I'm winning. It's not even a question of whether I think I'm going to win or not. I'm winning.

188
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,680
Let me explain to you who these people are.

189
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,680
This is New York's finest CDPD.

190
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,680
What I'm focused on most is tech expert.

191
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,680
You're ready, sketch.

192
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,680
I'm ready, let's go, let's do it.

193
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,680
It's going to be very competitive.

194
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,680
A lot of the best players from the country are in it.

195
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,680
This is for $2,000.

196
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,680
Here we go.

197
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,680
I have the speed mile record for New York City.

198
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,680
I was the first person to get the highest score

199
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,680
and the hardest only course in the game,

200
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,920
which is a marathon course.

201
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,880
I've cleared over a thousand beats per minute.

202
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,080
I would rank myself up there.

203
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,360
I would rank myself the best, I mean.

204
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,720
Me, me, me, me, I, I, I, I, I.

205
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,480
A thousand beats a minute?

206
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,900
Uh, what?

207
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,480
I think he's talking about the arrow scroll speed.

208
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,720
I know, but.

209
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,560
Yeah, I know, I know.

210
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,560
Whatever.

211
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,580
Not to sound cocky, but I work hard for it.

212
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,380
Not to sound cocky or anything,

213
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:21,680
but did I mention how awesome I am?

214
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,560
We had it taken off.

215
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,980
hold on hold on extra for hold on

216
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,680
let's reaffirm something here how how how much about this whole DDR in the

217
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,040
culture everything do you know about

218
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,840
I don't know that much actually so as an outside observer repeat what you just

219
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,880
said off the microphone

220
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,280
I think having the bar behind him is cheating

221
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,160
because it's he's leather it's letting himself push on them numbers faster

222
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,260
and there's two numbers just

223
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:58,500
just arrows

224
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,340
my adrenaline is through the roof right now um best feeling i've had in my life

225
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:06,020
me and my friends are probably gonna go and celebrate and this is gonna hang in

226
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:09,860
my house and that's how it's gonna be yes

227
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,980
you're gonna hang the trophy in your house it looks like the same type of

228
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:19,300
trophy they give you for little league all right um here's some comments from

229
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:25,140
our chat room right now let's see uh jaded 2006 says lol i can do max 300

230
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:29,860
stealth uh let's see popanda 21 i'm the only person in the world that's perfect

231
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:38,340
uh let's see um sex testicle let's see uh where's the one somebody said something about

232
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,620
oh illusion says i could clean out my vagina with this guy

233
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:49,620
Zachu says, oh, Zachu says, fuck you man, try doing a ten-footer with six options, Extrofer.

234
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,620
Ooh, burn.

235
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,620
He just threw down.

236
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,620
I don't fucking care.

237
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:04,620
Oh wait, did I cause controversy? It's okay, just why don't you masturbate or something, it's okay.

238
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:09,260
like someone else in the tournament and he came in like third or second or something like that

239
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,860
and how this interview would end.

240
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,540
You know I still don't think he's as cool as the guy who did DDR on crutches.

241
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:22,540
Alright. The guy with one leg. Alright you asked we did we uh we uh went ahead and

242
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:27,940
talked about the video on the show I don't know if that's the res-

243
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:31,580
I don't know if that's- For the record I still think it's cheating.

244
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:35,620
I don't know if that's the response you wanted buddy, but sorry we call him as we see him

245
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,560
I might add his soft pad they had at home is

246
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:46,740
Red octane, you know wannabe pad. They look like crap skype lines open if I want to call

247
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,460
Let's just see who gets on there first

248
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:58,380
first.

249
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:02,180
I'm trying to wait for our British guy to call back because I promised we could get

250
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,900
him on.

251
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,700
I'm kind of secretly hoping Zach will call back too.

252
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,700
Hey Rob.

253
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,700
Yes.

254
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,840
I'm so awesome.

255
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:14,900
I can pass every song and I'm perfect.

256
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,900
Shut up.

257
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,900
We got a call back.

258
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,900
Hi.

259
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,900
Hi.

260
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,900
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

261
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,900
Simo again.

262
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:26,340
on no video this time that's all right how you doing simil yeah that should sort it out now

263
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:32,980
all right what's on your mind buddy um just about the ddr dancer uh-huh what about him

264
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,740
um basically just one thing

265
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:45,700
when he's actually dancing and everything why doesn't he just spend the 40 a day or whatever

266
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,700
whatever he's doing to buy a machine for home?

267
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,700
I don't know, that's a good question.

268
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,700
Well, you know, it's one of those impulse buy things.

269
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,700
It's harder, you know, we could probably say the same thing

270
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,700
about we pay $30 a month to do this radio show

271
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,700
and at that rate we could have bought our own server by now, you know what I mean?

272
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,700
I can't really talk. I did.

273
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,700
You built your own machine.

274
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,700
The difference between going out and spending $3,000 on a machine

275
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,700
and spending, how much did you spend on yours?

276
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,700
$3,000. That was the exact same conclusion I came to.

277
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:24,700
I was like, you know, I'm tired of playing in an arcade where all the machines are broken, so I'm gonna build my own. I did.

278
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:31,700
He doesn't get the recognition that he would get if he's playing it in front of people, so I think it's an arrogance thing, actually.

279
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,700
It's an ego thing.

280
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:40,700
He wants people around him to feed his ego. I mean, that's obvious, the way he was talking himself up, that he needed ego fodder.

281
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:46,740
I don't you know what I'm taking this with a grain of salt because I think I think the MTV guys might have embellished it

282
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,540
A little bit you know I just I those words came out of his mouth that is true

283
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:56,780
But I I know the power of editing and I think there could be something interesting going on here anyway

284
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,460
What else is on your mind simil?

285
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:04,380
Okay, well, thank you so much for calling back, and I'm sorry I didn't work out on the show earlier

286
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,780
That's okay. All right. Have a good one buddy. Thanks a lot all right. Bye. Bye

287
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,780
Bye.

288
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,780
Bye.

289
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,780
And get some sleep soon.

290
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,780
All right.

291
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,500
Oh, did I hang up on him?

292
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,500
Uh-uh.

293
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,500
Yeah.

294
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,500
Oh, whoop.

295
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,500
I hung up on somebody else.

296
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,500
Sorry.

297
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,500
All right.

298
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,500
There we go.

299
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,500
Let's go to this call.

300
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,500
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

301
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,500
Yeah.

302
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,500
It's me.

303
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,500
Yeah.

304
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,660
I guess it was a bad idea after all.

305
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,660
I mean, it's all right.

306
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,740
I mean, I can understand the criticism, but that's okay.

307
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,180
I mean, you call it as...

308
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,340
You pretty much called it as you see it.

309
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,340
Okay.

310
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,980
for me is that because you have you met this guy being on the outside I've met

311
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,520
this guy I've hung out with this guy you know on several occasions was this a

312
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,940
fair assessment of him um he's pretty much I mean if you get to know him he

313
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,860
doesn't sound very it doesn't sound as arrogant as you know it doesn't sound

314
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,900
you know it doesn't sound arrogant at all you really know how awesome I am

315
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:02,700
very humble we got to knew it's just you know when he gets the opportunity to for

316
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:08,020
these types of things he tries to market himself but you know as I said once you

317
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:12,140
get to know him he's pretty much very humble he just hates it you know he he

318
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,540
doesn't care about what other people says because he doesn't feed into that

319
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:19,260
negative negative but he knows how to strut his stuff on the catwalk right is

320
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,700
basically because he pretty much he has to put foot to ass to his skills put it

321
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,740
that way he didn't just magically get you know get them it was a long way up

322
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:32,480
there I respect that four to five years of hard work trying to get up to that to

323
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,660
that level okay you don't do that by showing off you earn people's respect

324
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:41,700
he you know this guy doesn't win all the time I mean you know when he loses he

325
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,940
learns from his mistakes to get better and you know honestly people like him or

326
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:53,100
you know our prime example of what a TDR player should be I totally disagree

327
00:20:53,100 --> 00:21:01,180
with well that's the best ER player the world can be complete jackasses no no I

328
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:06,300
didn't mean being an asshole or anything I just mean it just meant as

329
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:10,860
you know someone who wouldn't you know blatantly show off someone's very humble

330
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:18,780
I'm sure if he were truly that humble he wouldn't be such a braggart remember

331
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:23,700
and usually in real life he could prove that to you but the thing is that he's

332
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,820
making himself sound like he wins all the time and you yourself said no not he

333
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:32,800
does it depends you know mostly he's one of the best one of them but he was he

334
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:37,560
himself was saying he was the best believe me there are other people that

335
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:42,120
are up to his level and I'm from New York I would know it did say exactly to

336
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,360
be fair though he did say in that video that he was you know he was he was

337
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,200
bragging about being you know the best so but I mean but I I understand you

338
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,080
know but I'm trying to give this guy a break because I understand that kind of

339
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:58,600
energy that having an MTV person in your house can kind of give you that sort of

340
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,240
thing you know you're gonna make yourself sound like the shit I

341
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:07,080
Understand that what happened to the Asian people weren't they the best at it what the Asian with the stereotype

342
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,560
No

343
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:20,960
Though I honestly would like to I would honestly like to see see that guy versus like a

344
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,720
Tigger or a

345
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,240
Who's that?

346
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,480
bitsy j s b now that our j s b i mean this guy's played pickles you know what

347
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,240
i want to talk about a pump

348
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,960
pompous nevermind i'm not one you mentioned

349
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,640
i'm not gonna i'm not gonna go there cuz i'm gonna get more hate mail you know if

350
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,920
you go to digital life this year guys you probably will see him

351
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,440
and if you you know if if willing you probably will get the chance to

352
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,960
interview him can't can't wait can't wait

353
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,080
i can't wait to meet him all right zack we have a good one

354
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,760
all right later we wanted to give you a fair counterpoint here on the program

355
00:22:54,760 --> 00:23:11,760
Alright, I know some of you guys are trying to get in, but we're way past the three hours of our lives that we've set aside for this program, so we're going to try and get back into it, we want to do the cage match, maybe we'll open up Skype a little later, because I saw some people calling in that weren't trying to call during the live show, so I want to see if I can maybe get a couple of them.

356
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,760
Yeah, I gotta make a song.

357
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,760
Yeah, when are you going to make your stinking song?

358
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:29,160
I was working on it and I keep, I have a really bad thing with writer's block right now and I've been trying to get past it. I've been like taking breaks from stuff and you know going back to it and it's just not working.

359
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:33,200
So, my thing is now is I'm gonna make a song.

360
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,920
I don't care how crappy it is, I'll submit it. Because

361
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:43,380
I've got to do something. So I can at least listen to the other songs so I can

362
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:49,520
play them on the show. Alright, we're gonna get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match now.

363
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,060
It's a very important part of our show.

364
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:54,240
After all that fighting, what more appropriate thing to do than the Orange

365
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,360
Lounge Radio Cage Match? Let me readjust the volume levels here so I don't blow out

366
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,300
your speakers at home.

367
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:07,620
The way the Orange Lounge Radio cage match works, three songs go into the cage match,

368
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,820
one from each co-host here on Orange Lounge Radio.

369
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:13,760
You guys vote for your favorite, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long here

370
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:19,380
on Orange Lounge Radio's 24-7 Bimani and Video Game Music program, and let's start off with

371
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,940
a clip of last week's winner.

372
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:25,740
It was my pick, because I'm special, okay not really, but you guys did vote for it.

373
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:30,540
Deep Dish with a song named after the town where Orange Lounge Radio broadcasts from.

374
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:37,540
West Coast yo, it's Deep Dish with Sacramento, song number one, it's a nice case measure.

375
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:05,540
I'm just a man

376
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:14,540
California's sleeping and you've got me weeping

377
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:17,540
I am just a man

378
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:22,540
I can't help the feeling that love is always stealing me

379
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:32,540
Loosen hand, Loosen hand

380
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:39,540
Loosen hand

381
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:47,540
Don't understand

382
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:50,540
Don't understand

383
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:54,540
Hi there, it's song number one in our cage match, Eat Dish with Sacramento.

384
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:57,540
Let's get into song number two, which has come to us courtesy of Loki.

385
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,540
Loki, what did you pick for us tonight?

386
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:02,540
I picked the song by quarter.

387
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:07,540
He's the guy that did some stuff on diverse systems.

388
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:10,540
I want to say he might even be working on stuff now.

389
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:17,540
There's a lot of those diverse system artists that crossed over to DJ Maxx and Odo Jamz.

390
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:22,020
So, he might be on one of the- on TJ Maxx, but I can't remember.

391
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:27,020
Anyways, um, this song's called Grand Parade, and I completely picked it out at random, so...

392
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:33,020
Alright, we'll see if, uh, random picks are successful for Loki. Here's song number two tonight.

393
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:40,020
quarter with Grand Parade. Enjoy!

394
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,020
Oh

395
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,020
Oh

396
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,020
Oh

397
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,020
Oh

398
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,020
Oh

399
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,020
Oh

400
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,020
Oh

401
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,020
Oh

402
00:32:33,020 --> 00:33:01,280
Song number two, Quarter with Grand Parade, let's go around and parade and cover that

403
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:06,240
song in rose petals during the parade, or cover it in poop. Dark Sakura.

404
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,760
I give the fact that it finally ended a 10. Other than that, I give it a 3. It was very

405
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,760
repetitive, very boring, very...is it ever over yet?

406
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:25,440
Alright. Loki. I give it a 5. I actually stopped listening to it after a while. Alright. I

407
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,360
also give that song a 5, because that song reminds me of something from 2DX 5th style.

408
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:35,360
Like a very generic 2DX song, spread out across about 25 minutes.

409
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,360
Xtavor, you wanna rate that song?

410
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,360
Um, I don't- I don't even remember it.

411
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,360
So I give it a zero.

412
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,360
Alright kids, Dark Soccer has a chance to redeem, I guess, a little bit here.

413
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,360
Wow, we all panned that one.

414
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,360
Dark Soccer, what do you think of song 3? What's coming up?

415
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,360
This is a group, I believe they're from the Bay Area, called Babyland.

416
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:07,880
they are sort of a synth industrial pop punk. They do some of everything like

417
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,680
their drum kit is like metal tubs and pipes. They're really

418
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:17,560
amazing. The song is called Jerry, I think is how it's pronounced. Yep. And actually

419
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,880
there's a video for this that's up on their website too, but they're just

420
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:23,440
fantastic. I'm going to see them in Berkeley on the 15th next month. So it's

421
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,640
an indie band. Indie! Oh yeah, I go indie as often as I can. Alright here it is

422
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:34,640
star number three, Babyland. Jerry, enjoy.

423
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:11,640
We build from experience We go on, because we know there's nothing more than wanting

424
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:24,640
Conquest past the bitterness To hold on, and you know there's something worth awaiting

425
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:29,640
This is the part of me I understand though

426
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:34,640
I know I can't control the wonder of it all

427
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,640
I truly have a feeling

428
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,640
Don't tell me I'm wrong

429
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:46,640
I'm living on to the part of something new

430
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:51,640
Straight lines and stereotypes are the fun

431
00:35:51,640 --> 00:36:00,640
As nature continues to crawl, curved lines in the big city skies

432
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:05,640
The bright lights in the open your eyes, in your eyes

433
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:14,640
We grow from experience

434
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:22,640
We go on because we know there's nothing worth inquittin'

435
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:27,640
To bow down to the negatives

436
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:35,640
We hold strong because we know there's something worth awaitin'

437
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,640
This is a part of me not understandin'

438
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:45,640
No, I can't control the wonderful surprise

439
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:49,640
It's building, it's building

440
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,640
Don't tell me I'm wrong

441
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:57,640
I'm living hard to be part of something new

442
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:04,640
The straight lines and the stereotypes are gone

443
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,640
As nature continues to crawl

444
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:15,640
Curved lines in the big city skies Bright lights and open your eyes, in your eyes

445
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:32,640
We live for the experience We go on because we know there's something to this wanting

446
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:38,640
I want to see your mask in your eyes

447
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,640
There, in your eyes

448
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,640
Let's go!

449
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,240
I got the sleep of the plan

450
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:17,740
Do what I can, set it aside, cause I know what I am

451
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:23,740
And I apologize if you can't comprehend

452
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:27,740
You know the easiest way, get through each day

453
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:30,740
But adding on in the smallest way

454
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:36,740
Can't wait to see what tomorrow will bring

455
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:39,740
Your eyes

456
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,740
Your eyes

457
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,740
Your eyes

458
00:38:46,740 --> 00:39:04,980
All right, that was song number three in tonight's cage match, Babyland with Jerry.

459
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,740
Let's go around and see what the folks thought of that.

460
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,740
Dark Sakura!

461
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,460
Ten, and I'm gonna see them next month.

462
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,460
That rocks.

463
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,460
Loki.

464
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,460
Eh, I don't know.

465
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,460
Seven.

466
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,460
Okay.

467
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,460
Extifer.

468
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:22,460
I haven't been being... no, no, it was good. I liked it. It was better than the last one.

469
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,860
Seven.

470
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:32,900
Oh, I like the music. It kind of sounds like the Postal Service, but like, I don't know,

471
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:37,960
like a little more hardcore, which is pretty cool. The vocalist was a little screamy for

472
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:44,280
me though. I don't like the screamy guys. I don't know. Not my thing. But I like the

473
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:49,820
I thought musically it was good. So I give the music a nine. I give the singing a little less

474
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,600
So I think I'll give it a seven and a half overall

475
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,780
All right. So let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight. Here we go

476
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:01,360
Starting off with song number one deep dish with Sacramento

477
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:14,360
And song number two you can vote for tonight is Quarter with Grand Parade.

478
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:24,920
Imagine that for about five minutes. Song number three is Babyland with Jerry. Sorry,

479
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:39,040
Loki. All right, guys, place a vote now. Send a private message to Sky in the chat

480
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:44,320
room with your vote and we shall reveal the winner a little later in the program.

481
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,560
Well, Dan, we're running really late tonight. We've been on air for three and a half hours now.

482
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,080
Can you believe that?

483
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:52,040
I know. It's like the old days when we did the podcast after.

484
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,800
I know, but we just had a lot to say tonight. Pretty crazy, I guess.

485
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,720
We are some chatty, chatty people.

486
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,360
That's right. Loki, what the hell are you doing online over there? I see you doing something

487
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,600
game related. I can't see what she's doing, but I can see what you're doing.

488
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,120
Loki?

489
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,920
I'm just looking up the achievements for Redracer 6.

490
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,000
They're hard.

491
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,520
I can't remember where they are.

492
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:13,560
You know most games give you like one really easy achievement, like power on the game and

493
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:18,220
kill one monster and you get like 5 points, Ridge Racer don't give you any of that.

494
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,080
You have to like 360 and you get 5 points.

495
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:24,740
I can't even, I thought I did a 360 but I guess that's just my car spinning around a

496
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,740
lot because I hit a wall.

497
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:30,040
I finally broke the barrier in Ridge Racer, I was able to beat the first race finally

498
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:34,320
so I, and then like after beating the first race I was able to clear like 10 races.

499
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,320
Like really easy.

500
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:39,680
So I don't know, I finally got over my Ridge Racer handicap, I guess.

501
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:45,440
What is that about Splinter Cell or Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter?

502
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,840
It says it only has 925 achievement points.

503
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,440
I thought it had a thousand.

504
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,440
So there's like...

505
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,500
No, every game has a thousand, except that one.

506
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,500
For some reason.

507
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,500
That has 925.

508
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,500
I don't know why.

509
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,200
You got robbed of 75 points somewhere.

510
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,200
Stupid.

511
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:05,400
I have 1340 out of 14625 based on what I own.

512
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,880
And you have a perfect 1000 in full auto now, huh?

513
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,080
Yeah, I have full autos finished.

514
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,880
So I have 50 out of 50 for that.

515
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,880
Good job.

516
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,520
But like, there's games I bought, you know, now, at the time at launch, you know, I thought,

517
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:22,780
oh, those are gonna be really cool games, you know, like Perfect Dark Zero.

518
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:26,160
And I haven't played, I've played that twice.

519
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,680
I couldn't get into Perfect Dark Zero.

520
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,500
I understand where people are like totally loving this game. I couldn't do it.

521
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:37,140
I liked the club. I liked the club level in that game. That really was the most fun level

522
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,860
to me. But I can't play it because I get motion sick.

523
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:44,220
Yeah, it's just, it's just, I've played mostly the arcade games. Like most of my achievements

524
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,300
are little 200 pointer games.

525
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:50,580
Well, I have a lot of the arcade games. Like, I need, here's the ones I got to play through.

526
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:54,660
Because I'm playing on selling some of this stuff back. Full auto, I'm debating whether

527
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:58,800
I want to sell it back because I do like the game, but I'm kind of done with it, and there really isn't

528
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,840
In multiplayer wise it's only two player, and there's not really any good deathmatch type you know

529
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,080
You know stuff for it, so

530
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,640
I'm thinking probably just gonna sell that one back

531
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,960
But the other games I want to like blaster real quick the outfit

532
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,480
I need to go through that real quick because it's a cool game, but uh I

533
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,560
Don't know. I just haven't really played it online

534
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:30,200
online. Call of Duty 2, I'm kind of getting tired of that game, so I need to finish the

535
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:37,280
whole game on, I guess, Veteran, which should be friggin' hard. And Ghost Recon, eh, I just

536
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:42,120
need to play that more. It'll be, I think, a lot more fun. I don't know, Need for Speed

537
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:47,360
Most Wanted, that game looked kind of lame, so I just have to go through that. Then I

538
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:51,000
need to borrow your Cameo, because I started achieving points on that, and I sold mine

539
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Yeah, you can borrow that. I want to play Burnout, so we'll make a little trade or something.

540
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Maybe Amp 3 or something. Well, I'm almost... I'm on rank...

541
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Wait, do you have Amp 3, like with you?

542
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I had Amp 3.

543
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Oh, damn you.

544
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Why?

545
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I need to play more games.

546
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I sold it back, but I'm gonna probably buy it again.

547
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Okay.

548
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Because it actually, for those who might not know that out there, it dropped in price to $39.99.

549
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Oh, that's cool.

550
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,960
So, if you can find it, great, um, actually now I can get games through my work, so all

551
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:26,940
the new release games I can get for cost plus 7.75% or tax.

552
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,940
So let me borrow Need for Speed, I'll let you borrow Cameo.

553
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,580
I need something I haven't played yet.

554
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:36,860
Well, I can let you borrow Need for Speed, I've got like, yeah, sure, alright, it's a

555
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:37,860
cool game.

556
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:38,860
Something you're not playing a lot of.

557
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:42,300
It's a cool game, I just, um, I just haven't really gotten into it yet.

558
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,860
Okay, that'd be cool.

559
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:47,860
Because I want to get some more achievement points too. I'm feeling like achievement point

560
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:48,860
whoring it up a little bit.

561
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:49,860
I swear to god that shit is crack.

562
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:50,860
Is it?

563
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:52,860
It gets me to buy games I wouldn't normally buy.

564
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:55,860
See, that's Microsoft's got you. Buy the balls.

565
00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:01,860
Alright. To be honest, I do buy games just for the show to talk about them.

566
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:04,860
You know what? I find that to be my weakness too. In fact, I was just commenting.

567
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:07,860
We were in Fry's the other day and I was just commenting to somebody that like,

568
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:11,860
Oh my god, I started buying a lot more games when we started doing this program.

569
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:15,620
It's bad. Just to give me more to talk about on the program,

570
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:18,500
we need to get gaming companies to send them to us for free. I think that should be our

571
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,060
mission at E3 this year.

572
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:23,060
Well no shit, I'm selling them at work. We're supposed to be getting them sent to us,

573
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:23,620
but

574
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:29,100
certain people in certain parts of Texas are cock blocking me when it comes to

575
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,900
getting free products sent, so.

576
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:34,340
All right.

577
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:37,100
Xtavor, you had a comment you wanted to make a little bit ago.

578
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:42,100
I just wanted to say I'm sorry if I offended anybody tonight.

579
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:46,500
I just thought I would be a little bit gentleman-like and say that. Extend my

580
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,420
apologies.

581
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:51,860
He got a good lashing during the cage match. No, I'm teasing.

582
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:57,500
I'm glad to hear it. Alright, anyway, let's do the winner of tonight's cage match, shall we?

583
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,860
You guys wanna hear who won? Sure.

584
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:04,000
I will let you know that song two did get one pity vote.

585
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,760
so uh... you know i didn't get it was it wasn't all for nothing mochi

586
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,480
uh... but in the end only one of the other two songs could be victorious and

587
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:14,960
it was

588
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,040
gerry

589
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:19,240
indian

590
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,980
with the screaming guy

591
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:26,620
okay a lot of their other stuff is a lot more industrial sound and you know so

592
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:28,560
his screaming does fit but that one

593
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:32,040
i actually thought that you would like that one for the synth poppy i do i like

594
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:35,040
I love the music. The guy's voice is a little wacky.

595
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,040
They have Myspace up that's got more of their stuff on there too.

596
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,040
I'll check it out.

597
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,040
Speaking of Myspace, we're on Myspace.

598
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,040
Yes we are.

599
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,040
We love Myspace.

600
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,040
Get this, Echo Image has a Myspace.

601
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,040
The singer from Echo Image freaking commented on my Myspace.

602
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,040
That made me such a screaming little girl earlier this week.

603
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,040
I mean seriously, that is so cool.

604
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,040
So check that, Echo Image is on Myspace.

605
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,040
Azoic is on Myspace as well.

606
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,040
I'm trying to think of other DDR bands I saw in there.

607
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,040
I don't know, but Orange Launch Radio is on there too.

608
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:03,040
just uh... it's what myspace.com slash orange andreo i think and uh...

609
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,600
there's clips of our show and i'll probably put the chocobo clip up from

610
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:10,040
tonight because that was pretty funny. We'll link the MySpace in our live journal community.

611
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:13,480
I think we posted there before but we need more people to join. We only have fifty friends.

612
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,160
I know there's more than that listed in the show.

613
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,320
We're being total MySpace whores now but we will not spam.

614
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:22,880
We might leave comments... I'll have to say that fifty in the first couple of weeks is not bad.

615
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:23,960
It's not bad at all.

616
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,160
We might leave comments that says thank you for being... we have to come up with some

617
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,960
funny Myspace pictures so maybe we'll work on that this week and leave you

618
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:33,520
guys some comments but we will not send random messages to people saying hey

619
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,040
you're a fan of such-and-such you should listen to Orange Laundry at no I hate

620
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:41,520
that shit I always report that stuff for I always flag it for spam abuse so we

621
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,800
might we might comment on your right on your Myspaces though if you don't like

622
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,680
us commenting on your Myspace you can delete it we won't be offended but we're

623
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:52,520
gonna comment alright I think that's it I know we have chat room F used to do

624
00:47:52,520 --> 00:48:01,540
too, but honestly I kinda wanna just wrap it up. Yeah, I need to go. Yeah, one more

625
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:05,000
thing. Sorry chat room, but we know you're angsty too, but we'll just have to get that

626
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:11,240
in another time. So just yell them out real quick in the chat room. Do an F-you post on

627
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:16,360
our live journal community. There you go. Alright, that's gonna do it for now though.

628
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:20,080
Oh, I need to check. During the cage match I actually ran out and took a picture of my

629
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:23,500
Xbox with the Mario background. I'm going to try and upload that to the forums if the

630
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:29,460
picture finally posted here. Look for that on our forums a little later. I think that's

631
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:32,860
about it, you guys. Have a good one. Thank you so much for listening.

632
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:33,860
I'm sleepy.

633

No. Sarge? No. Rosemary, the telephone operator? No. Henry, mild-mannered janitor?

656

Could be. Hong Kong Phooey, number one super guy.

657
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:39,220
Hong Kong Phooey, quicker than the human eye. He's got style, a groovy smile, and a vibe that just won't stop.

658
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:43,220
When the going gets rough, he's super tough with the Hong Kong Phooey Chop!
