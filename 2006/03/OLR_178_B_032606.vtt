00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
And we're back here with Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 178.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.520
March the 26th of 2006, a little exciting first half there, talked about Game Developers Conference.

00:29.520 --> 00:33.400
Whole lot of news there in the first half, so if you haven't heard it yet, if this is

00:33.400 --> 00:37.320
maybe the first episode of Orange Lounge Radio you're ever hearing, that's cool, but

00:37.320 --> 00:41.160
remember that we distribute the podcast in two halves, so you might want to look

00:41.160 --> 00:44.920
back in our podcast history there on iTunes or on our website.

00:44.920 --> 00:48.520
Even on the feed itself, you can go back and retrieve the old MP3s.

00:48.520 --> 00:52.120
Check out the first half of the show as well for a lot of news. But that doesn't

00:52.120 --> 00:56.240
mean the news is done yet, we've got plenty more to come, including, now I thought this

00:56.240 --> 01:00.560
rumor was already done with, Loki, Microsoft entering the portable market, I thought the

01:00.560 --> 01:03.880
origami thing came and went, but what's happening now, Loki?

01:03.880 --> 01:08.740
Well there's another rumor going around, this time it's brought to you by Dean Takahashi

01:08.740 --> 01:17.320
of the Mercury News, and basically running a story that Jay Allard leading a team with

01:17.320 --> 01:22.120
Greg Gibson, the system designer for the Xbox 360, and Brian Lee, the finance chief for

01:22.120 --> 01:29.120
the Xbox business, and basically working on a device to, you know, combat against the

01:29.120 --> 01:33.260
PSP which is going to do video, music, and games.

01:33.260 --> 01:37.980
And the device is supposedly in the early stages of development and should be hitting

01:37.980 --> 01:40.280
store shelves in 2007.

01:40.280 --> 01:41.280
Maybe?

01:41.280 --> 01:46.560
I don't know, there hasn't really been anything that says that.

01:46.560 --> 01:49.640
a lot of rumors because you know it makes sense but

01:49.640 --> 01:53.840
I don't know if it could be a bomb that they'll drop at E3

01:53.840 --> 01:57.200
never know. Yeah

01:57.200 --> 02:01.160
then again it's awfully close to April. Just coming off of this origami stuff within

02:01.160 --> 02:02.840
the past couple weeks too I

02:02.840 --> 02:06.520
take this with a huge grain of salt and a grain of pepper while you're at it I

02:06.520 --> 02:07.480
mean this is kinda

02:07.480 --> 02:10.720
we will see I mean

02:10.720 --> 02:15.880
it suppose you know anybody could be secretly plotting a portable gaming

02:15.880 --> 02:20.000
system there could there could be a secret fourth console being plotted

02:20.000 --> 02:23.020
right now who knows I mean this is all kind of conspiracy theories in a way

02:23.020 --> 02:29.520
the Phantom the return of the Phantom actually there was someone that was

02:29.520 --> 02:34.240
talking about working on a console and I had to laugh oh boy all right well here's

02:34.240 --> 02:38.440
something that's not a rumor well it was a rumor then it was a debunked rumor and

02:38.440 --> 02:42.340
then it turned out to be true so here's the news that you know rumors sometimes

02:42.340 --> 02:48.460
do turn out to be true, Dell did acquire Alienware earlier this week, they did announce that

02:48.460 --> 02:52.420
they have acquired Alienware and this was after Dell came out and said they were not

02:52.420 --> 02:54.300
looking into buying them.

02:54.300 --> 03:09.700
What's interesting is Alienware's kind of response to this.

03:09.700 --> 03:14.580
They say here, we believe that this acquisition will offer our customers the best of both

03:14.580 --> 03:17.860
worlds, an Alienware that takes advantage of the world-class business practices and

03:17.860 --> 03:21.960
operational efficiencies that have made Dell one of the most respected companies in the

03:21.960 --> 03:27.800
world while preserving the DNA of the Alienware brand and the product strategy portfolio.

03:27.800 --> 03:32.160
So perhaps the biggest surprise to most people will be that youíre not going to see a lot

03:32.160 --> 03:33.740
of changes after this announcement.

03:33.740 --> 03:38.180
Youíre not going to see Alienware logo show up on Dell products and vice versa.

03:38.180 --> 03:41.940
Our website is not going to change and the majority of our business practices will stay

03:41.940 --> 03:43.740
the same.

03:43.740 --> 03:49.740
That quote coming from one of the executives, oh no, that's Alien CEO, Nelson Gonzalez,

03:49.740 --> 03:52.640
so kind of interesting there.

03:52.640 --> 03:56.180
Their perspective on it is like, okay, yeah, Dell bought us, but they're not going to change

03:56.180 --> 04:02.540
this yet, although usually in buyouts, change is inevitable, but we'll see, we'll see.

04:02.540 --> 04:06.660
Alright, let's go to another story, we're going to go over to Loki, who has a story

04:06.660 --> 04:17.020
about Namco yes ah anyways if you're um excuse me lose my voice here um if

04:17.020 --> 04:22.700
you're interested in some fine Namco products then you'll be surprised to

04:22.700 --> 04:27.980
know that a club Namco has launched it's basically like an online you know shop

04:27.980 --> 04:34.580
for Namco related goodies including t-shirts stuff toys and more whoring of

04:34.580 --> 04:41.500
the pac-man franchise correct yes plenty plenty of whoring being done by pac-man

04:41.500 --> 04:46.580
but they had some pretty cool stuff like you can get the pac-man and the stuff

04:46.580 --> 04:54.620
ghosts as well as Dig Dug and Galaga t-shirts numerous pac-man t-shirts and

04:54.620 --> 05:00.180
including a pac-man like cushion for chair cushion

05:00.180 --> 05:03.980
anything new like Tekken? No?

05:03.980 --> 05:07.780
I want a Pac-Man Ghostie. I actually do have a

05:07.780 --> 05:12.020
Pac-Man plushie. Does anybody remember the Pac-Man board game?

05:12.020 --> 05:15.980
Yes. I had this when I was a kid. It was the biggest pain in the ass to set up.

05:15.980 --> 05:19.700
You had this big board of white marbles and a couple of yellow marbles

05:19.700 --> 05:22.980
and like you had the giant Pac-Man things that you could actually go...

05:22.980 --> 05:26.340
it was so lame but at the same time

05:26.340 --> 05:30.340
Maybe this is why my parents really enjoyed when I would play this game

05:30.340 --> 05:32.580
because, you know, it was so tedious to set up the board

05:32.580 --> 05:37.780
that it shut me up for a little while, so who knows. Sorry, that was random.

05:37.780 --> 05:42.820
We do that on the show, deal. Moving on, Dark Sakura likes to travel the world

05:42.820 --> 05:44.380
from her laptop and

05:44.380 --> 05:48.980
she likes to bring us some news for our friends overseas, like what's going on in

05:48.980 --> 05:49.740
the UK?

05:49.740 --> 05:53.100
There's several things going on, although some of this

05:53.100 --> 05:56.200
also floats the international scene,

05:56.200 --> 05:59.960
I should say. Well, usually, you know, a lot of times the news does, the stuff we

05:59.960 --> 06:01.920
talk about here happens there, stuff that happens there

06:01.920 --> 06:06.760
goes on over here, so it's inevitable. Well, Scott Henson of Microsoft

06:06.760 --> 06:10.980
is basically going through considerations on how to improve the

06:10.980 --> 06:13.080
Xbox 360 dashboard and multimedia.

06:13.080 --> 06:17.520
Actually, this sort of stems from some of the results of the

06:17.520 --> 06:22.040
PS3's online interface, but they basically left

06:22.040 --> 06:27.180
the dashboard for the 360 as something that is infinitely upgradable.

06:27.180 --> 06:28.440
Smart.

06:28.440 --> 06:32.560
They have been talking to, taking the suggestions of those people on

06:32.560 --> 06:34.680
Xbox Live who've been turning them in

06:34.680 --> 06:37.880
and are trying to put more features on there

06:37.880 --> 06:41.140
that the Xbox market will want.

06:41.140 --> 06:44.820
Something I learned this week, when you set a picture as your background,

06:44.820 --> 06:48.400
I'd like to be able to set different pictures for different pages

06:48.400 --> 06:51.040
in the dashboard. So if anybody from Microsoft's listening,

06:51.040 --> 06:54.360
That would be my suggestion, allow more customization in that aspect.

06:54.360 --> 06:56.360
It doesn't cost me points, thank you.

06:56.360 --> 06:59.520
Well there is a comment on here just to

06:59.520 --> 07:01.160
quote.

07:01.160 --> 07:04.300
You said the capability is there. There are a lot of

07:04.300 --> 07:06.600
there are all kinds of features that have come in.

07:06.600 --> 07:09.640
One of the top requested features is the ability to download from the marketplace in

07:09.640 --> 07:13.440
the background, so we're looking at it and prioritizing that list of requests.

07:14.560 --> 07:18.420
Basically didn't comment on anything in particular. They're also talking about

07:18.420 --> 07:22.020
um... their uh... hd specifications how they want to keep it high but aren't

07:22.020 --> 07:26.980
gonna they're gonna keep it in the level of this listeners are focusing on

07:26.980 --> 07:28.460
okay not listeners

07:28.460 --> 07:29.780
players right

07:29.780 --> 07:35.520
sorry ending of our listeners but i love you all

07:35.520 --> 07:40.220
you know there's also um... mention consideration of blue ray but i don't

07:40.220 --> 07:43.820
know that they're necessarily going to be looking into it

07:43.820 --> 07:49.520
Honestly, I'm tired of hearing about all the blu-ray rumors versus HD DVD and blah blah blah. Yeah

07:50.600 --> 07:51.980
also

07:51.980 --> 07:57.940
Something that we did touch on earlier. They're going to be Megadrive games on the revolution

07:58.460 --> 08:01.100
to go ahead and clear things up for our u.s. Listeners in

08:01.820 --> 08:03.420
Europe the

08:03.420 --> 08:06.580
Genesis was called the Megadrive as it was in Japan

08:07.260 --> 08:09.420
So we are going to be seeing

08:09.420 --> 08:14.180
Genesis Mega Drive games on the Revolution available. They're doing, they

08:14.180 --> 08:19.980
call it the Virtual Console, will feature NES, Super Nintendo games,

08:19.980 --> 08:26.860
TurboGrafx, and backwards compatible GameCube through the disk drive. But Sega

08:26.860 --> 08:31.940
is, we actually have a quote from Nalya Tsurumi, who's the CEO of Sega

08:31.940 --> 08:36.220
America and Sega Europe. Sega's support of the Virtual Console system will

08:36.220 --> 08:39.340
introduce more gamers to the classic Mega Drive hits and reinvigorate many

08:39.340 --> 08:40.620
of our popular brands.

08:40.620 --> 08:43.740
That's interesting, now why did they release it with two separate names? Why did they re-brand

08:43.740 --> 08:46.660
at the Genesis here? Because I didn't follow, do you know? Because I didn't follow that

08:46.660 --> 08:48.200
whole saga, this is years ago.

08:48.200 --> 08:52.980
I don't know, it has to be part of a marketing deal or whatever, but like a, for example,

08:52.980 --> 08:57.340
Sega CD was the Mega CD, it's just how it was.

08:57.340 --> 09:02.980
How they did it, alright, whatever. So you Europe folks, whenever we're talking about,

09:02.980 --> 09:07.360
you know, hooray, Sega Genesis games are compatible, just know that for you, replace Genesis with

09:07.360 --> 09:09.140
Mega Drive, and you're good.

09:09.140 --> 09:10.700
or SEGA does what Nintendo don't.

09:10.700 --> 09:12.420
Oh, stop. Moving on.

09:12.420 --> 09:13.380
Um...

09:13.380 --> 09:15.620
Guess what game's gonna be on the DS?

09:15.620 --> 09:18.900
Uh... Well, I already know, because I looked at the outline for tonight, but, uh...

09:18.900 --> 09:20.900
Play along!

09:20.900 --> 09:24.660
I don't know Dark Sakura. What game will be playable on the DS?

09:24.660 --> 09:25.540
A gun game!

09:25.540 --> 09:26.580
Oh, right! I like guns.

09:26.580 --> 09:28.100
But not really.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.300
Point Blank is gonna be out on the DS.

09:30.300 --> 09:31.140
Uh, we'll use the stylus.

09:31.140 --> 09:34.060
I was hoping for Wild Gunman.

09:34.060 --> 09:34.580
No, I won't.

09:34.580 --> 09:35.380
Or Hogan's Alley.

09:35.380 --> 09:36.220
Gangster Town.

09:36.220 --> 09:36.780
Alright, anyway.

09:36.780 --> 09:39.580
from the Master System since we've been talking about Sega.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.240
Point blank was cool too.

09:41.240 --> 09:43.040
I really dig point blank,

09:43.040 --> 09:44.880
but basically, instead of using the light gun,

09:44.880 --> 09:47.280
you're gonna use the stylus, tap on the screen.

09:47.280 --> 09:49.040
You have your arcade mode.

09:49.920 --> 09:52.040
You have 40 different sequences

09:52.040 --> 09:54.740
that are gonna be coming up from the arcade

09:54.740 --> 09:55.900
in the PlayStation games.

09:55.900 --> 10:00.080
You'll shoot clay pigeons, cardboard cutouts, aliens,

10:00.080 --> 10:03.940
everything, little bouncing balls, Pac-Man, not really.

10:03.940 --> 10:05.340
All right.

10:05.340 --> 10:09.500
There's a wireless multiplayer mode that's going to work with one card,

10:09.500 --> 10:14.300
a high score free play mode, a few others.

10:14.300 --> 10:15.900
There's going to be a

10:15.900 --> 10:20.300
a mode called brain massage which analyzes and offers feedback as you play.

10:20.300 --> 10:25.740
Brain training anyone? The other is called games museum

10:25.740 --> 10:29.960
kinda on the wording there but um...

10:29.960 --> 10:32.660
it's basically adapted

10:32.660 --> 10:34.600
older point blank levels.

10:34.600 --> 10:38.080
levels. I think that's kind of an interesting concept. I'm surprised we haven't seen this

10:38.080 --> 10:41.120
yet, or at least if it's been out, I haven't heard of it, so sorry.

10:41.120 --> 10:44.120
Like a gun game with the stylus, it's kind of,

10:44.120 --> 10:47.560
I'm kind of surprised it's taken us this long to get there, but... You know what I'd like to see?

10:47.560 --> 10:48.640
A neat idea.

10:48.640 --> 10:52.360
Is the Gun Survivor series, the Biohazard Gun Survivor series. Oh my gosh, wow.

10:52.360 --> 10:56.600
With the stylus. You know, I actually really enjoy playing,

10:56.600 --> 11:00.880
because when we went to Las Vegas way back when on the DDR Freak Moderators

11:00.880 --> 11:01.560
trip,

11:01.560 --> 11:04.280
I got to play Biohazard Gun Survivor 2.

11:04.280 --> 11:08.320
which was the one set in the Code Veronica universe and that was cool

11:08.320 --> 11:11.480
it was always, you controlled it with the gun

11:11.480 --> 11:15.120
I always felt they should have a game like that on the DS where you're controlling it

11:15.120 --> 11:16.000
and then using your

11:16.000 --> 11:19.040
d-pad to shoot to, you know, but

11:19.040 --> 11:22.840
no one ever listens to my suggestions in the video game industry. I had a gun con

11:22.840 --> 11:23.840
I don't, which is

11:23.840 --> 11:27.040
strange because I usually don't collect a lot of the accessories but I did have a

11:27.040 --> 11:29.600
gun con, I like point blank. I have my gun con too

11:29.600 --> 11:33.320
I actually have the upgraded gun con

11:33.320 --> 11:36.360
because I wanted to get Vampire Knight. I never did.

11:36.360 --> 11:40.080
Oh well. And besides that, it's all about House of the Dead.

11:40.080 --> 11:43.800
So, there's a little bit more.

11:43.800 --> 11:47.480
There was an announcement by Nintendo

11:47.480 --> 11:51.960
and British Telecom saying that they're going to be over 600 Wi-Fi hotspots

11:51.960 --> 11:55.400
for the DS and other Wi-Fi capable units.

11:55.400 --> 11:59.320
It's a Nintendo UK and BT open zone

11:59.320 --> 12:05.740
announced that they are going to have these hotspots open up to retailers

12:05.740 --> 12:10.740
across the UK and Ireland. The hotspots are going to provide these retailers and

12:10.740 --> 12:16.220
their customers with ways to use the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection service.

12:16.220 --> 12:22.940
There's also going to be different playable demos, movies of upcoming titles,

12:22.940 --> 12:27.820
sort of how we saw at E3 that are going to be available. Some of these items are

12:27.820 --> 12:31.720
are going to be, um, actually some of these locations, I'm sorry,

12:31.720 --> 12:36.400
there's the download stations located at Game, Game Station, HMV, Toys R Us,

12:36.400 --> 12:40.700
Smith's Toys, and other different retailers across, uh,

12:40.700 --> 12:45.840
the area. Uh, games to be initially included in downloads, Plarium, Meteos,

12:45.840 --> 12:49.280
um, you get to meet, uh, Miyamoto's Nintendog pick.

12:49.280 --> 12:53.960
Um, upcoming downloads in April and May, they're going to be Pokemon Link,

12:53.960 --> 13:00.680
Trauma Center under the knife, Dr. Kalashima's brain training, how old is your brain?

13:00.680 --> 13:08.420
Other playables, there's going to be special items for Animal Crossing, and a special Metroid

13:08.420 --> 13:10.720
Prime Hunter's movie.

13:10.720 --> 13:14.080
You know, I'm kind of surprised we don't see, and maybe the internet kind of kills this,

13:14.080 --> 13:19.400
but I'm surprised we don't see DS clubs pop up at little coffee shops and things where

13:19.400 --> 13:22.920
people could convene once a week, bring your DS and play games,

13:22.920 --> 13:27.720
beam demos to each other, because a lot of games, like I think Meteos has in some of the other games,

13:27.720 --> 13:31.560
you can beam a demo of the game to somebody with a DS, you know, like

13:31.560 --> 13:35.160
just kind of like meet up and play some DS games in person, because while

13:35.160 --> 13:39.320
Wi-Fi is cool and all, there's something to be... about having that feedback in

13:39.320 --> 13:42.280
person of somebody going, ah, you bastard, you know,

13:42.280 --> 13:45.960
you killed me and all that stuff. Keep in mind those demos only stay on your system as long as

13:45.960 --> 13:47.800
as your system is not turned off.

13:47.800 --> 13:53.140
Well that's true, but you know, I remember E3, we downloaded the Meteos demo, my buddy

13:53.140 --> 13:56.160
Brad and I downloaded the Meteos demo, went back to the hotel that night and played all

13:56.160 --> 13:57.160
night long.

13:57.160 --> 13:58.160
It was awesome.

13:58.160 --> 14:00.520
Well see, I actually downloaded Electroplankton.

14:00.520 --> 14:03.960
I was never able to get that game, I was never ever able to get that game, like it was always

14:03.960 --> 14:04.960
full whenever I tried to grab it.

14:04.960 --> 14:09.280
I was playing Electroplankton in the line to get into the Playstation 3.

14:09.280 --> 14:11.000
Oh yeah, that's cool.

14:11.000 --> 14:16.700
But I think that, you know, it's a really cool thing, I think, that Nintendo's doing

14:16.700 --> 14:19.840
by having all these various hotspots.

14:19.840 --> 14:25.100
Not only is it opening more places for gamers to get the new stuff as it comes out, making

14:25.100 --> 14:30.440
it available, it's offering more interactivity among gamers, I think.

14:30.440 --> 14:35.320
The closest thing I've seen to this, besides, of course, those, you know, game cafes, is

14:35.320 --> 14:40.600
I was at a coffee shop not too long ago and saw three people with a laptop playing Quake.

14:40.600 --> 14:52.000
Also, not to say it's the very least, but we have the last segment in our UK news, which

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
is release date!

14:54.000 --> 14:57.400
Alright, what kind of cool stuff is coming out for the UK folks?

14:57.400 --> 15:01.720
On the 30th, we have Brick Em All and funny cards on the Game Boy Advance.

15:01.720 --> 15:04.840
We have Animal Crossing coming out on the 31st.

15:04.840 --> 15:05.840
About time!

15:05.840 --> 15:11.440
You know, I really hope that the friend code thing works internationally because I've got a bunch of people on there

15:11.440 --> 15:16.000
I'm going to be making room for new people. Hmm. So definitely let's play with some of our UK listeners

15:16.520 --> 15:21.680
Also armored core 9 breaker on ps2 battle of Europe condemned criminal originals

15:22.200 --> 15:24.000
Condemned a pretty neat game

15:24.000 --> 15:29.440
CSI three dimensions of murder Desperados 2 far cry instincts evolution and predator

15:29.440 --> 15:37.920
Ice Age 2, the Meltdown video game. We have Odama, Outrun 2006. Love Outrun.

15:37.920 --> 15:42.880
Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney, grab it while you can.

15:42.880 --> 15:46.400
Resident Evil, Deadly Silence, Tales of Fantasia, which actually excites me.

15:46.400 --> 15:51.000
That's where all our copies of Phoenix Wright went. They went over to Europe.

15:51.000 --> 15:56.880
Also there's a tie three, Night of the Quinkan and Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon

15:56.880 --> 16:00.360
advanced warfighter.

16:00.360 --> 16:03.520
Very cool. Lots of stuff to look forward to over there in the UK. Lots of good stuff.

16:03.520 --> 16:04.840
Outrun.

16:04.840 --> 16:07.880
How about the US? What's coming up in the US?

16:07.880 --> 16:11.640
Fun stuff, of course. Of course we've got...

16:11.640 --> 16:16.120
Kingdom Hearts 2 and Beatmania. Yes, Kingdom Hearts 2 and Beatmania. That's on my list, yes.

16:16.120 --> 16:19.800
We do have some other games, of course.

16:19.800 --> 16:23.200
Far Cry Instincts Predator if you're having a 360.

16:23.200 --> 16:30.920
Rumble Roses XX, which should be a girl-tastic, and there's also going to be full spectrum

16:30.920 --> 16:35.600
warrior 10 hammers on Playstation 2 and Xbox.

16:35.600 --> 16:41.200
And I believe, I want to say those are the major ones here, I'm sure I'm forgetting something.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.400
Let me take a quick look-see here.

16:43.400 --> 16:48.040
Oh, I'm sorry, Far Cry Instinct's Evolution, that's right, the one that's coming out, the

16:48.040 --> 16:51.520
expansion that's coming out on the Xbox as well.

16:51.520 --> 16:55.320
And Dicey Warriors 5, Empires.

16:55.320 --> 17:01.520
For the 360, it's only $39.99 if you're interested.

17:01.520 --> 17:08.200
And for your GameCube fans, Harvest Moon Magic Melody, yet another Harvest Moon game.

17:08.200 --> 17:10.000
Cows and sheep and puppies.

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
I don't hear a lot about GameCube games anymore, which is kind of sad.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.720
About two a month.

17:15.720 --> 17:16.720
Too bad.

17:16.720 --> 17:22.280
Now, Orange Mountains Radio started as a station dedicated to music and rhythm video games,

17:22.280 --> 17:25.440
so of course we like to keep tabs on what's going on in that scene, because of course

17:25.440 --> 17:29.320
a lot of our listeners that have been listening to us for the four years we've been going

17:29.320 --> 17:30.800
expect it once in a while.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.480
We're going to talk about music news.

17:32.480 --> 17:35.800
So Loki, some news going on with In the Groove this week, right?

17:35.800 --> 17:39.660
Yeah, In the Groove is having their PC beta right now.

17:39.660 --> 17:47.500
You can actually go download it off their beta website and you can play a two song demo.

17:47.500 --> 17:51.640
Now haven't I played this beta before when it was called StepMania?

17:51.640 --> 17:52.640
You may have.

17:52.640 --> 17:53.720
Just curious.

17:53.720 --> 18:00.940
Ironically enough, I did poke around the data files on there and yep, it is StepMania.

18:00.940 --> 18:04.740
To set this up for folks who may not know what we're talking about here, In the Groove

18:04.740 --> 18:08.220
is a DDR-like game that came out

18:08.220 --> 18:11.860
and it's based off a PC

18:11.860 --> 18:16.340
simulator for DDR that's a few years old called StepMania.

18:16.340 --> 18:20.060
They got together with the folks that made StepMania and out came In The

18:20.060 --> 18:20.500
Groove.

18:20.500 --> 18:24.220
But now you're saying when you poked around these files you found that...

18:24.220 --> 18:27.580
Okay, basically the way it is set up here, they have

18:27.580 --> 18:30.620
instead of having all your sim files and everything in there, they have a

18:30.620 --> 18:31.660
directory of

18:31.660 --> 18:36.740
pack files or PCK files and there's one file that's an index file for that. That

18:36.740 --> 18:38.660
basically tells the program how to

18:38.660 --> 18:43.120
unzip everything and extract it so you can play it. And that way you can't go and

18:43.120 --> 18:45.820
mess around with the files because they're encrypted and

18:45.820 --> 18:49.440
compressed. But when you look at the index file

18:49.440 --> 18:52.980
you notice a couple things. First off you have

18:52.980 --> 18:56.720
they actually have.sm on the

18:56.720 --> 18:59.960
files. And the best part about this

18:59.960 --> 19:04.600
You know how they have in StepMania when you're doing edits and stuff and it'll have

19:04.600 --> 19:08.280
you know, your directory, your folder,

19:08.280 --> 19:12.240
you can switch between different folders and stuff to edit songs. Well, they still left it in there

19:12.240 --> 19:15.760
in the Integroove beta. They left

19:15.760 --> 19:19.840
in the folder stuff so you can actually see what exactly looks exactly like the

19:19.840 --> 19:21.240
StepMania step editor

19:21.240 --> 19:26.360
and... Now this is an early build though, right? They may take some of this out or what?

19:26.360 --> 19:28.260
I guess they could, but...

19:28.260 --> 19:29.260
Or it could be a marketing tool.

19:29.260 --> 19:30.260
Hey, make your own song.

19:30.260 --> 19:33.980
I just hope they're not selling or planning on selling this because I don't see the point.

19:33.980 --> 19:37.980
Well, DDR came out on the PC and a lot of people didn't see the point of that.

19:37.980 --> 19:42.400
Yeah, but it's not based on a game that's been out there already or a program that's

19:42.400 --> 19:45.820
been out there already that's free.

19:45.820 --> 19:50.780
You know actually how I think that Rockstar could sell more copies of this.

19:50.780 --> 19:52.440
Make this PC release coming up.

19:52.440 --> 19:54.480
If they're doing this, make it into Groove 2.

19:54.480 --> 19:58.120
it for the PC before you release it on consoles. Well, some people will buy them both, just

19:58.120 --> 20:02.000
have them both. Well, here's the cool, I guess the cool thing about it, you can make edits

20:02.000 --> 20:06.020
and transfer them to USB drive so you can actually go and play the arcade, you know,

20:06.020 --> 20:10.300
your edits on the arcade. Okay. I guess that's kind of cool, but I think you can pretty much

20:10.300 --> 20:17.260
do that anyways if you have StepMania. I think there's a way to do it, yeah, but... So, I

20:17.260 --> 20:23.140
don't know, I'm... Okay, well, remember, remember, we are, and some of our listeners too, our

20:23.140 --> 20:27.120
listeners that are music game-oriented, put yourself on the issue is we are a minority

20:27.120 --> 20:32.680
of the gaming public at large. A lot of the gaming public has no idea that StepMania even

20:32.680 --> 20:38.160
exists and when they see this on store shelves, I might be a parent buying this for my kid

20:38.160 --> 20:43.520
going, oh, I want my kid to get fit and I don't have a console, but I have a PC. So

20:43.520 --> 20:46.560
that's where this game's going to sell. I don't think it's going to really sell amongst

20:46.560 --> 20:50.160
the hardcore. Let me put it this way. Same thing with DDR. I always said the exact same

20:50.160 --> 20:55.840
thing about DDR PC. It's the only reason to have that. I mean, it's a crappy release compared

20:55.840 --> 21:01.700
to most of the console ones. The only reason to have it is for, A, all the downloadable

21:01.700 --> 21:07.440
characters like Mr. Spanky, and B, to have it on the PC when you don't have a console

21:07.440 --> 21:10.340
in your house, like if you're a family that doesn't have a console in your house.

21:10.340 --> 21:17.740
So I mean, it's just, it's very lazy to me, to be honest, if it's, I don't know, it's

21:17.740 --> 21:23.220
just, well if you're willing to check it out, if you want to check it out, here's where

21:23.220 --> 21:24.220
you gotta go.

21:24.220 --> 21:33.600
Just go to www.inthegroove.com slash page slash itg underscore pc underscore mac underscore

21:33.600 --> 21:37.820
demo underscore beta, if that's easy enough for you guys.

21:37.820 --> 21:43.980
And you'll fill out a nice little survey and you'll download a torrent file where you can

21:43.980 --> 21:45.780
download the actual beta.

21:45.780 --> 21:50.000
Which might take a little bit of time because apparently the torrent speeds are pretty slow.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.100
Mine went pretty quick, but I don't know.

21:52.100 --> 21:56.780
I played it and immediately when I played the game, you know, I tried it out to see

21:56.780 --> 21:58.900
if it's anything special.

21:58.900 --> 22:01.340
It just reinforced the fact why I don't like In the Groove.

22:01.340 --> 22:03.840
So I don't know.

22:03.840 --> 22:07.540
Go ahead, check it out, but it's just StepMania.

22:07.540 --> 22:08.540
That's all it is.

22:08.540 --> 22:09.540
Alright.

22:09.540 --> 22:14.620
Moving on, real quick note, there's really not a lot to say about this, Spider-Man 3

22:14.620 --> 22:19.800
is coming out for the revolution, that's about all there is to say, Spider-Man 3 is coming

22:19.800 --> 22:24.480
out for the revolution, the game, not really a big surprise seeing as usually these movie

22:24.480 --> 22:28.280
type games tend to be released on all the consoles, right?

22:28.280 --> 22:33.680
But now what may be a little bit of a surprise is that if you trace the big corporate structure,

22:33.680 --> 22:39.600
Sony somewhat funds the Spider-Man franchise, so you would think it would be a PS3 exclusive,

22:39.600 --> 22:40.940
but not really.

22:40.940 --> 22:41.940
It's not the way it's going to go.

22:41.940 --> 22:46.160
Where there's money to be made, they will release the games.

22:46.160 --> 22:47.960
So that's that.

22:47.960 --> 22:52.280
Loki, you also have another release news information?

22:52.280 --> 22:57.360
Yeah, 99 Nights, which is another kind of Dynasty Warriors-ish game that's out in Japan

22:57.360 --> 23:02.000
right now, is going to be coming to the US in the fall.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
And that should be pretty cool.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.320
like a pretty decent game so does that mean we'll finally get the demo one of

23:06.320 --> 23:11.680
these days yeah well actually the demo just needs a hit on live right now

23:11.680 --> 23:16.600
they're just offering it as like a you know what on the CD only or DVD only so

23:16.600 --> 23:20.840
as soon as that hits on live then yeah you can actually probably play the demo

23:20.840 --> 23:26.080
here in the States but um I don't know until then we just need more games that's

23:26.080 --> 23:29.760
all Ron Chan says in our chat room there over to orange launch radio.com click on

23:29.760 --> 23:37.360
chat, a note for me, if I recall correctly, Activision owns the console rights to Spider-Man.

23:37.360 --> 23:42.800
That may be true, but who do they buy those rights from?

23:42.800 --> 23:48.000
Moving on, we're going to get into another story here, Dark Sakura, you have another

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
release information.

23:49.000 --> 23:54.760
Actually, I do, and normally I hold off, I only mention the releases that are coming

23:54.760 --> 23:59.080
out in the following week for the UK releases, I do have one to add though that was brought

23:59.080 --> 24:04.120
to my attention by our longtime listener Simmel who's actually listening right now at 4 a.m.

24:04.120 --> 24:06.120
4, 5, 6 a.m.

24:06.120 --> 24:07.120
That's hardcore.

24:07.120 --> 24:08.440
Yeah, that is hardcore.

24:08.440 --> 24:15.620
That Guitar Hero is actually getting a UK release on 7th of April for 50 pounds.

24:15.620 --> 24:19.080
It's getting a lot, a lot, it still gets a lot, a lot of coverage.

24:19.080 --> 24:20.760
Well, it's expensive here too.

24:20.760 --> 24:22.120
You know, I'm almost...

24:22.120 --> 24:25.720
But that comparably is more expensive than it was here.

24:25.720 --> 24:31.240
Don't get me wrong, I think Guitar Hero is a great game, but at the same time, I'm really

24:31.240 --> 24:35.960
starting to get sick of hearing about it all the time, and how revolutionary it is when

24:35.960 --> 24:36.960
you kind of think...

24:36.960 --> 24:40.600
Keep in mind, we've had it for a while, they haven't had it yet, they're...

24:40.600 --> 24:46.180
No, I know, no, no, the mention of this makes me think about how saturated Guitar Hero is

24:46.180 --> 24:52.440
over here right now, and don't get me wrong, it's a great game and all, but you know, it

24:52.440 --> 24:53.440
doesn't...

24:53.440 --> 24:54.720
It's not that revolutionary.

24:54.720 --> 24:58.840
It's not that revolutionary to me, because we've had Guitar Freaks, we've had Frequency,

24:58.840 --> 25:01.280
we've had Amplitude.

25:01.280 --> 25:06.080
The only thing that kind of sold this game was the fun element of it, and the way they

25:06.080 --> 25:08.140
kind of tied it all together.

25:08.140 --> 25:13.920
But I'm kind of like, okay everybody, let's move on, let's get to new games.

25:13.920 --> 25:16.880
I'm glad that it is coming out of here, because I feel like a lot of people have missed out

25:16.880 --> 25:17.880
on it.

25:17.880 --> 25:18.880
I really enjoy it.

25:18.880 --> 25:19.880
Yeah, they can check it out.

25:19.880 --> 25:21.480
We've got our second guitar now.

25:21.480 --> 25:24.280
I know, I've seen that they sell the guitars separately, too.

25:24.280 --> 25:26.440
They have a red one that costs like $10 more.

25:26.440 --> 25:30.240
I bet Konami's kicking their butts right now for not releasing guitar freaks here a couple

25:30.240 --> 25:31.240
years ago.

25:31.240 --> 25:34.640
Should have had more faith in music games over here, Konami Japan.

25:34.640 --> 25:40.600
Anyway, there's another game that we're going to be seeing at E3.

25:40.600 --> 25:41.600
What's that?

25:41.600 --> 25:50.200
Bioware is going to have some stuff out for an Xbox 360 RPG called Mass Effect.

25:50.200 --> 25:57.240
So they're saying, it's speculated either this year or next, it's going to have players

25:57.240 --> 26:04.800
who form bands of adventurers and go on and kick alien butt in the future, you know, go

26:04.800 --> 26:09.800
around different planets, explore them, pillage as you roam, you know, go to different solar

26:09.800 --> 26:13.720
systems, different places.

26:13.720 --> 26:20.960
BioWare spoke to IGN during the Game Developers Conference and said that prior to the battles

26:20.960 --> 26:25.260
which are going to be in real time, players can get together and make strategies, can

26:25.260 --> 26:31.800
swap characters when the fights go on, you have your different types of characters, your

26:31.800 --> 26:37.200
typical ones like your long short range or healer, blah blah blah.

26:37.200 --> 26:43.440
But it looks pretty cool, I'll get some pictures of this for our people who are listening live,

26:43.440 --> 26:48.440
we are going to be able to see it for a demo at E3 this year.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.440
Among many, many other things at E3 this year.

26:51.440 --> 26:52.440
We're going to be busy.

26:52.440 --> 26:54.440
We're going to have to divvy it up between us.

26:54.440 --> 26:56.440
There's no way we're going to hit it all.

26:56.440 --> 26:59.440
We're going to have to get the book and sit on the floor in the lobby.

26:59.440 --> 27:03.440
Okay, you go here, here, and here, and I'm going to be like, Sega.

27:03.440 --> 27:05.440
I know, I know.

27:05.440 --> 27:09.440
I'm crossing my fingers and my toes that we are going to get the media thing after all,

27:09.440 --> 27:11.440
so we'll get to go in a little bit early.

27:11.440 --> 27:14.640
thinking I'm pretty much going to burn that time waiting in line for Nintendo

27:14.640 --> 27:16.880
Revolution because I know that is the first place I want to go.

27:16.880 --> 27:18.200
Press doesn't have to wait.

27:18.200 --> 27:20.380
No we don't.

27:20.380 --> 27:22.880
Shit, cool.

27:22.880 --> 27:26.080
I didn't know. Well I'm hoping, I'm crossing my fingers and my toes we get to

27:26.080 --> 27:29.240
get to see it because I really want to share with you guys all about that and of

27:29.240 --> 27:31.760
course we will be broadcasting from E3,

27:31.760 --> 27:36.400
still working out some details, but you can look forward to daily podcasts just like we did last year.

27:36.400 --> 27:38.200
I want to be able to broadcast

27:38.200 --> 27:40.200
I told you so!

27:40.200 --> 27:44.340
Well, the listeners might be the ones broadcasting back to you, buddy.

27:44.340 --> 27:45.340
You better be careful.

27:45.340 --> 27:48.640
All right, anyway, moving on to another story.

27:48.640 --> 27:51.800
You were talking in the first half, Loki, about you've been playing Elder Scrolls IV

27:51.800 --> 27:52.800
Oblivion.

27:52.800 --> 27:54.960
Now, the game's already broken.

27:54.960 --> 27:59.560
You were talking about a bug earlier where you couldn't jump in a certain point of the

27:59.560 --> 28:00.560
game.

28:00.560 --> 28:05.440
You stuck because you were floating on a rock or something, but what else is broken in Oblivion?

28:05.440 --> 28:10.840
And while sometimes the load times tend to be extremely long, and this is because the

28:10.840 --> 28:16.900
hard drive, it caches the game to the hard drive so that it loads faster and plays faster,

28:16.900 --> 28:19.060
but sometimes it gets fragmented.

28:19.060 --> 28:24.800
However, at least they figured out that that's possible and what they did is built in a fix

28:24.800 --> 28:25.800
for it.

28:25.800 --> 28:29.880
So if you do have that happen where your load times are excruciatingly long, what you need

28:29.880 --> 28:35.800
do is actually hold down the A button when you, you know, reset the game and let it boot

28:35.800 --> 28:40.800
up to the title screen and that's it.

28:40.800 --> 28:44.240
So pretty simple, but at least they built in a fix for it.

28:44.240 --> 28:45.560
Is that in the manual?

28:45.560 --> 28:47.120
Or do you just have to kind of figure that out?

28:47.120 --> 28:48.680
No, that's not in the manual.

28:48.680 --> 28:49.760
Alright.

28:49.760 --> 28:50.760
You know what?

28:50.760 --> 28:51.760
Broken things make me angry.

28:51.760 --> 28:53.440
I don't know about you, but broken things make me angry.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.120
I don't like it when my games are broken.

28:55.120 --> 28:57.560
And so that takes us to the FUs of the week.

28:57.560 --> 29:01.600
This is the part of the show where we get a little bit angry at things, and they might

29:01.600 --> 29:06.160
have to do with gaming, and they might not, but we're here to vent, so please listen to

29:06.160 --> 29:07.720
us for a little bit as we get a little angsty.

29:07.720 --> 29:09.760
Are you ready to get angsty, Dark Sakura?

29:09.760 --> 29:10.760
Am I ever.

29:10.760 --> 29:12.760
All right, you're gonna start us off.

29:12.760 --> 29:25.560
My F.U. of the week goes to Tequila.

29:25.560 --> 29:31.980
oh tequila how you make me suffer you make my stomach hurt worse than anything

29:31.980 --> 29:37.680
in the universe ever does anything less than Patron is not worth drinking oh how

29:37.680 --> 29:44.080
I hate thee dear tequila die not love dark sakura

29:44.080 --> 29:51.040
all right I'm laughing because I was there that night were there you also an

29:51.040 --> 29:56.880
F you to cheap sour mix, but mostly cheap tequila.

29:56.880 --> 30:00.480
You know what, Jason was telling me that he's regretting not taking pictures of you passed

30:00.480 --> 30:02.480
out because it would have been pretty funny now.

30:02.480 --> 30:03.480
What?

30:03.480 --> 30:09.520
He didn't get any, but he told me regret's not taking any.

30:09.520 --> 30:10.520
What?

30:10.520 --> 30:11.520
Okay, I...

30:11.520 --> 30:13.400
Admit it, it would be funny in context.

30:13.400 --> 30:20.800
To explain, I have insanely good alcohol tolerance, however, I have zero tolerance when it comes

30:20.800 --> 30:26.200
On top of that, I think I am somewhat allergic to it because I woke up with a rash on my

30:26.200 --> 30:30.680
neck, which I only get a rash on my neck if I have had something, if I consumed something

30:30.680 --> 30:31.680
I am allergic to.

30:31.680 --> 30:33.680
So I think I am allergic to tequila.

30:33.680 --> 30:36.200
You know, we haven't done a drunk show in a while.

30:36.200 --> 30:37.200
We have not.

30:37.200 --> 30:40.160
You know, I was reading a negative review about this show on the internet somewhere

30:40.160 --> 30:43.200
that says that it is very unprofessional for us to be doing a drunk show.

30:43.200 --> 30:50.480
And I am thinking to myself, okay, the whole point of independent podcasting is to do things

30:50.480 --> 30:52.880
That other people are too afraid to do

30:53.360 --> 30:59.320
So the drunk shows are some of our listeners most favorite shows and we're always responsible about it

30:59.320 --> 31:03.360
We always give disclaimers about it. So get off your high horse asshole

31:03.640 --> 31:08.060
What I have a designated driver to pick me up always always we do it safe

31:08.060 --> 31:12.600
So, I don't know I just had to get that that's that's another f you f you to a but you know

31:12.600 --> 31:18.480
I actually am that but as far as my I've been I've seen you drink on the show in the one time

31:18.480 --> 31:23.600
I got sick on the show from drinking was with that cheap tequila that was sitting on top of your refrigerator

31:23.920 --> 31:27.320
At the old apartment that stuff was now. What was cheap?

31:27.320 --> 31:34.440
What I was drinking that tequila, and I finished what a fourth of the bottle, and then I got really sick and ate waffles

31:34.440 --> 31:37.820
Oh, thank you chat room chat room makes an excellent point here Gk

31:37.840 --> 31:41.960
128 says dig nation was taped at the bar two weeks ago, and I know that

31:42.600 --> 31:46.600
This week in tech has done shows at pubs and stuff so that guy can go

31:46.600 --> 31:50.000
So take a fly and leap.

31:50.000 --> 31:55.400
I was watching a show where it was a science experiment show where they had people going

31:55.400 --> 32:02.080
out and taking them to the pub to get smashed off their butt and then go the next day and

32:02.080 --> 32:06.280
find out what was the best hangover cure.

32:06.280 --> 32:11.240
We always set limits, be safe about it.

32:11.240 --> 32:13.600
I think now we have to set a date to do another one.

32:13.600 --> 32:21.480
Just defy these negative reviews and reaffirm our independence from these corporate non-drinking

32:21.480 --> 32:22.480
entities.

32:22.480 --> 32:26.240
You know what, the only way for me to actually be significantly drunk on the show is if I

32:26.240 --> 32:28.640
put down the $16 and get a couple bottles of chamet.

32:28.640 --> 32:31.040
Well then we'll just all have to chip in and make it happen.

32:31.040 --> 32:32.520
Well I'm good.

32:32.520 --> 32:36.280
That is the, for the record, that is the only beer that will have me drunk in one pint.

32:36.280 --> 32:37.720
Alright, we gotta keep moving, we gotta keep moving.

32:37.720 --> 32:38.720
Let's get to the game segments.

32:38.720 --> 32:40.240
Okay, your F.U. real quick.

32:40.240 --> 32:45.240
Um, just a stupid driver, because I've seen too many people today, like,

32:45.240 --> 32:48.160
going in the wrong direction on the road.

32:48.160 --> 32:51.580
Well, is it like, you know, when we're at lunch? Are you sure you just weren't playing a lot of burnout? No, when we're going,

32:51.580 --> 32:54.640
when we're at lunch, you know, the women trying to back up.

32:54.640 --> 32:58.120
Oh, yeah, the chick that was trying to back up, yeah, yeah, that was kind of crazy.

32:58.120 --> 33:00.280
Just, you know, I don't know.

33:00.280 --> 33:01.040
Stupid people.

33:01.040 --> 33:03.320
My F.U. would have to be

33:03.320 --> 33:07.040
too, uh, having to be sober while everyone else I was with was, like,

33:07.040 --> 33:12.160
literally everyone I was with Friday night was drunk, but I had to be sober

33:12.160 --> 33:15.340
because it's very responsible to have a sober driver

33:15.340 --> 33:20.560
but next time it will not be me. Mark my words, it will not be me next time.

33:20.560 --> 33:24.440
Somebody else gets to play. Alright, that's it.

33:24.440 --> 33:31.200
Moving on, next segment. Our next story we're gonna go over to

33:31.200 --> 33:36.120
me and we're gonna talk about the video game voter network. We mentioned this on a

33:36.120 --> 33:37.500
previous podcast.

33:37.500 --> 33:39.580
Last week we were talking about the Video Game Voters Network.

33:39.580 --> 33:40.580
It just launched.

33:40.580 --> 33:47.120
Weíll get this, 20,000 messages were sent to U.S. Senators in just a week of this network

33:47.120 --> 33:48.120
being up.

33:48.120 --> 33:53.340
So you guys really took action on this really quickly and of course something we may not

33:53.340 --> 33:57.100
have mentioned last week because it wasnít exactly clear to us at that time, but the

33:57.100 --> 33:58.860
ESA does have a hand in this.

33:58.860 --> 34:05.260
This is I believe the ESA kind of their response to all this stuff going on is to really mobilize

34:05.260 --> 34:09.400
the gaming community but I stand by what I said last week it's a smart idea and

34:09.400 --> 34:12.520
if you're sick of all this stuff you got to do something about it right just like

34:12.520 --> 34:15.140
the kid we were talking about in the first half that was getting sued you

34:15.140 --> 34:18.340
know if you want to make change you got to do something about it also what I

34:18.340 --> 34:21.160
thought was interesting is that on the site now they actually have a letter

34:21.160 --> 34:26.620
from Will Wright, Will Wright of course made many many classic games and what

34:26.620 --> 34:30.260
he's working on that spore thing now it's supposed to be this

34:30.260 --> 34:35.080
This is a hugely comprehensive game, this is going to be insane.

34:35.080 --> 34:38.540
Will Wright actually posted a letter to the site there urging people to join.

34:38.540 --> 34:43.680
So if you don't want to join Video Game Voters Network because we told you to, then consider

34:43.680 --> 34:48.120
Will Wright's opinion for a minute, because that man's made a lot of great stuff.

34:48.120 --> 34:57.600
All right, let's go over now to Loki, who has a story speaking of legal things.

34:57.600 --> 34:59.900
You've got to file patents when you're going to do new stuff.

34:59.900 --> 35:02.280
And sometimes it tells us what's coming up, right, Loki?

35:02.280 --> 35:06.160
Yeah, well, the story that actually came out this week

35:06.160 --> 35:10.360
about the PSP keyboard, it's actually

35:10.360 --> 35:13.440
kind of there is a patent for a keyboard that

35:13.440 --> 35:16.960
was going to be used via the USB port on the PSP, which

35:16.960 --> 35:19.420
is kind of retarded when you think about it because that

35:19.420 --> 35:22.080
would mean that the keyboard is above the monitor

35:22.080 --> 35:23.080
when you're typing.

35:23.080 --> 35:25.720
So that would be completely awkward.

35:25.720 --> 35:31.360
But that was one of the things that came out, and they had kind of like a cell phone little

35:31.360 --> 35:32.920
doohickey on there.

35:32.920 --> 35:38.120
So I don't know if that's something that they're still working on, but this was actually I

35:38.120 --> 35:43.360
think shown at E3 a couple years ago, I want to say, when they originally showed the PSP.

35:43.360 --> 35:47.680
I want to say that this was one of the things that they showed, or maybe it was at one of

35:47.680 --> 35:51.600
the shows, and they had actual pictures of it that I've seen.

35:51.600 --> 35:54.680
But I don't think it's anything, they're probably going to change it some.

35:54.680 --> 35:58.440
that was interesting however there was another patent though that was filed that

35:58.440 --> 36:00.200
I thought was pretty interesting

36:00.200 --> 36:03.860
and that would be by Take Two for Vice City Stories

36:03.860 --> 36:07.080
the next PSP Grand Theft Auto game. Hoo-yah!

36:07.080 --> 36:11.840
We think, right? I mean it's speculation but they have filed a

36:11.840 --> 36:15.160
patent on this name. Well, trademark. Sorry, trademark on the name.

36:15.160 --> 36:18.280
You can't patent a name, sorry. Even I should know that.

36:18.280 --> 36:19.600
Alright, interesting.

36:19.600 --> 36:23.040
Moving on, I got a story here on Windows

36:23.040 --> 36:30.000
Vista, of course this is going to be the next XP, the next version of Windows.

36:30.000 --> 36:34.680
Get this, if you want to be playing games on Windows Vista, they're saying that you're

36:34.680 --> 36:41.460
going to have to have two gigs of RAM in order to play games on Windows Vista.

36:41.460 --> 36:47.080
They're saying that 900 Meg seems to be the bare minimum to even use Word or PowerPoint.

36:47.080 --> 36:50.600
If you want to play Halo 2 or any of that stuff, you're going to have to have two gigs

36:50.600 --> 36:53.960
of RAM to play on Windows Vista.

36:53.960 --> 37:00.080
I suppose a little bit of this is rumor right now, but we'll see for sure when the system

37:00.080 --> 37:01.080
comes out.

37:01.080 --> 37:04.600
All I can say is that I guess I'm glad I did upgrade this system to 2GB of RAM, so that

37:04.600 --> 37:08.000
if I decide to get Windows Vista, I'll be okay and good to go.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.280
Look, you had another quick story on the Vista, though.

37:10.280 --> 37:16.420
Yeah, there was a rumor that the code was being reprogrammed by the Xbox team, and that

37:16.420 --> 37:19.560
rumor was, of course, debunked.

37:19.560 --> 37:22.240
Microsoft is saying no, that's not the case.

37:22.240 --> 37:25.440
Take it as a rumor.

37:25.440 --> 37:29.400
You know what's interesting? That program that I downloaded onto the

37:29.400 --> 37:33.920
computer to allow my Xbox to get the pictures and stuff from the network for

37:33.920 --> 37:34.940
my 360.

37:34.940 --> 37:38.680
The program actually looks like the Xbox 360 when you launch it. Like it makes

37:38.680 --> 37:40.880
your desktop look like the Xbox 360.

37:40.880 --> 37:44.800
It's kind of cute that they have that consistency going on.

37:44.800 --> 37:45.940
Interesting.

37:45.940 --> 37:49.860
I'm really looking forward to getting my Mac now even more.

37:49.860 --> 37:53.300
You know they do have a program for the Mac that'll let you

37:53.300 --> 37:56.820
connect with your 360. I think it's called Connect360, I think is the name of it.

37:56.820 --> 38:00.100
I don't think it does everything, but it'll do like the songs and stuff.

38:00.100 --> 38:02.900
I think it costs money, though. I don't know if it's totally free.

38:02.900 --> 38:06.260
The one thing, though, I'm going to be happy about my Mac is running virtual PC

38:06.260 --> 38:10.420
so I can still play Ragnarok, because Ragnarok will run just fine

38:10.420 --> 38:13.860
on virtual PC, and then run everything else that I need

38:13.860 --> 38:19.860
Me too. I can play World of Warcraft, I can actually even do podcasting and...

38:19.860 --> 38:24.320
Yeah, you're gonna have to get hooked up with GarageBand, the new one, it's very intricate

38:24.320 --> 38:27.440
when it comes to podcasting. I've tried to look at what we can do for this show with

38:27.440 --> 38:27.940
it, but yeah.

38:27.940 --> 38:34.080
Well, I'm also going to be, start using whatever their broadcaster is for Pumped Volume, which

38:34.080 --> 38:35.760
will be this week.

38:35.760 --> 38:38.360
Very cool. That's one of our spin-off shows on Orange Lounge Radio Live.

38:38.360 --> 38:38.780
Yes.

38:38.780 --> 38:39.860
And that's Tuesday nights?

38:39.860 --> 38:40.640
Tuesday nights.

38:40.640 --> 38:41.760
And I do a show on Wednesday nights.

38:41.760 --> 38:42.700
Live music.

38:42.700 --> 38:46.720
And Extafur is coming back at some point, I think he's going to move to Thursdays though.

38:46.720 --> 38:50.380
And who knows, we're still looking for more talent, if you want to do a live show on our

38:50.380 --> 38:54.800
network we might be able to hook you up, that would be cool.

38:54.800 --> 38:59.200
Speaking of Extafur, he's in the house right now, he just walked in, I guess he was on

38:59.200 --> 39:06.200
a little bit of a road trip there, and Extafur, didn't you go to like a big deal concert this

39:06.200 --> 39:07.200
week?

39:07.200 --> 39:08.560
Yes I did.

39:08.560 --> 39:09.560
First off, welcome to the show.

39:09.560 --> 39:12.040
Thank you, and you guys are speaking of me?

39:12.040 --> 39:13.800
Yes, your ears must have been burning.

39:13.800 --> 39:14.800
Oh, wow.

39:14.800 --> 39:15.800
You start sneezing a lot?

39:15.800 --> 39:16.800
No.

39:16.800 --> 39:20.320
When's your show coming back, your spin-off show?

39:20.320 --> 39:22.640
I'm thinking maybe in a couple weeks.

39:22.640 --> 39:26.080
And if you think we're politically incorrect on this show, oh my gosh, listen next for

39:26.080 --> 39:27.080
Show Some Night.

39:27.080 --> 39:28.080
Because he doesn't even really talk about games.

39:28.080 --> 39:29.120
Do you ever talk about games on your show?

39:29.120 --> 39:30.640
I can talk about video games.

39:30.640 --> 39:33.080
Alright, well you need to talk about video games tonight.

39:33.080 --> 39:34.080
What happened?

39:34.080 --> 39:37.320
You got to do something video game related that myself, Logie Darkstalker, none of us

39:37.320 --> 39:38.320
got to do.

39:38.320 --> 39:39.320
What did you do?

39:39.320 --> 39:47.920
Games Live, which was a concert in San Jose that they put on, and basically it's a bunch

39:47.920 --> 39:55.640
of video game music that is live with the orchestra.

39:55.640 --> 40:03.440
There was a choir there, and also I guess that one guy from that one show is hosting

40:03.440 --> 40:04.440
it.

40:04.440 --> 40:05.440
Tommy Tallarico, yeah.

40:05.440 --> 40:12.240
I don't know all of their names, but I can say that all of the music that they played

40:12.240 --> 40:14.000
was very beautiful.

40:14.000 --> 40:21.520
They played pieces from World of Warcraft, there was EverQuest 2, there was Kingdom Hearts,

40:21.520 --> 40:26.440
there was Zelda, there was Mario, there was Castlevania, apparently there was Metal Gear

40:26.440 --> 40:29.560
Solid, which I didn't see because we came in a little bit late.

40:29.560 --> 40:31.840
So you missed the pong.

40:31.840 --> 40:34.000
I want to know about the pong.

40:34.000 --> 40:37.680
They did Frogger, which wasn't that good.

40:37.680 --> 40:41.440
I heard on Bobby Black Wolf's show when he had Tommy Tallarico on that he was saying

40:41.440 --> 40:45.520
something about this whole Frogger setup, that they have people play live.

40:45.520 --> 40:47.880
What did they do?

40:47.880 --> 40:53.720
They were playing the game live and the conductor was conducting the music as they were playing

40:53.720 --> 40:54.720
the game.

40:54.720 --> 40:56.640
So it was like you were hearing the live music.

40:56.640 --> 41:01.400
It was a very expensive way to play a game, I guess.

41:01.400 --> 41:02.400
They joked about it.

41:02.400 --> 41:04.560
Well, didn't they give somebody a laptop for winning?

41:04.560 --> 41:09.000
They gave somebody a very nice laptop for winning at Frogger.

41:09.000 --> 41:13.040
He wasn't even that good, but he got a very nice...

41:13.040 --> 41:15.360
I don't know what it was called, but it's a very nice laptop.

41:15.360 --> 41:16.360
Was it Alienware?

41:16.360 --> 41:17.360
Is that it?

41:17.360 --> 41:18.360
I don't know.

41:18.360 --> 41:19.360
But it was very nice.

41:19.360 --> 41:21.560
I have memories of Frogger.

41:21.560 --> 41:22.560
That's just weird.

41:22.560 --> 41:23.560
It's a cool game.

41:23.560 --> 41:29.460
memories of being in middle school at the roller rink playing frog girl on roller skates?

41:29.460 --> 41:34.580
Did any of it make you cry? You know it didn't. I was there with my boyfriend, he was crying

41:34.580 --> 41:40.020
a little bit at some things. But no, they were, it was very nice and we sat like three

41:40.020 --> 41:47.020
seats, three aisles from the front. So we had very good seats and the conductor was

41:47.020 --> 41:52.920
funny that Tommy guy wasn't and basically you know as somebody that

41:52.920 --> 41:56.780
doesn't play a lot of video games I really do like the music you know

41:56.780 --> 42:01.900
because I I see it as the same as music that from motion pictures because it's

42:01.900 --> 42:06.580
just the same thing I mean just scores you know like they are scoring a movie

42:06.580 --> 42:12.780
and I've always liked soundtracks soundtrack music so I was I was kind of

42:12.780 --> 42:21.320
in my, you know, own place. I was very well... I thought it was a very well-done thing that

42:21.320 --> 42:22.320
they did.

42:22.320 --> 42:23.320
Alright.

42:23.320 --> 42:24.320
So, yeah.

42:24.320 --> 42:26.640
Alright, well, thanks for that little mini-review of Video Games Live.

42:26.640 --> 42:27.640
Yeah.

42:27.640 --> 42:30.280
So, now, this is touring, so would you recommend our listeners go see it?

42:30.280 --> 42:31.280
Yeah.

42:31.280 --> 42:34.260
I think it's touring, right? It was touring, then it wasn't touring. I'm pretty sure they'll

42:34.260 --> 42:35.640
do more shows of this, though.

42:35.640 --> 42:39.140
Yeah, they... I think it's really cool. I think a lot of people would be interested.

42:39.140 --> 42:44.020
If you like Halo, they did a huge thing from Halo at the end, it was a finale, and they

42:44.020 --> 42:49.260
had the actual guy who composed the music that was there, and they also had a lot of

42:49.260 --> 42:52.060
video game composers in the audience.

42:52.060 --> 42:57.820
You know that you were at the show during a really big week in video gaming in San Jose,

42:57.820 --> 42:58.820
right?

42:58.820 --> 42:59.820
Right.

42:59.820 --> 43:07.260
Well, apparently they had the big gaming thing in the same place as we went, but they also

43:07.260 --> 43:11.260
I also had the composer of World of Warcraft there. He was there. So that was kind of cool.

43:11.260 --> 43:15.260
When you do play games, that's all you ever play.

43:15.260 --> 43:19.260
I was in my element.

43:19.260 --> 43:23.260
Favorite song that they played all night?

43:23.260 --> 43:27.260
I think I would say Advent Rising.

43:27.260 --> 43:31.260
I've never played the game. I've heard that it's not that good.

43:31.260 --> 43:35.260
I thought that the music was gorgeous.

43:35.260 --> 43:40.100
game just has really horrible frame rate issues, so yeah.

43:40.100 --> 43:42.300
Alright, maybe we'll have to check that out.

43:42.300 --> 43:44.180
Yeah, it was gorgeous.

43:44.180 --> 43:46.380
And Kingdom Hearts was very well done, too.

43:46.380 --> 43:48.060
Did they do Simple and Clean from Kingdom Hearts?

43:48.060 --> 43:53.420
Well, it was the theme to the first game, so yeah, it did have that Simple and Clean

43:53.420 --> 43:54.420
theme.

43:54.420 --> 43:55.420
Cool.

43:55.420 --> 43:56.420
Alright.

43:56.420 --> 43:57.420
Thank you, Xfer.

43:57.420 --> 43:58.420
Appreciate it.

43:58.420 --> 43:59.420
No problemo.

43:59.420 --> 44:01.180
Alright, we're going to go over to DarkSakura every week.

44:01.180 --> 44:06.680
She climbs the internet up and down and searches to find a great website to share with you

44:06.680 --> 44:08.980
guys as her website of the week.

44:08.980 --> 44:13.160
So, DarkSakura, where should the kids be pointing their Firefox browsers to this time because

44:13.160 --> 44:16.000
if they are using Internet Explorer, they really should switch, right?

44:16.000 --> 44:30.320
a

44:30.320 --> 44:34.000
Really makes me giggle, but basically this is a tech

44:34.000 --> 44:38.480
It's a a tech site, but it's not like the tech sites that

44:39.640 --> 44:44.000
Are about you know big massive amounts of jargon?

44:44.800 --> 44:48.620
To go ahead and put their about us page. I'll just read a little bit of this

44:49.480 --> 44:52.600
Website for technology and you're currently surfing it. Thank you very much

44:52.600 --> 44:58.880
This site is very much different from the other technology site for the very reason that we bring technology close to the end user

44:58.880 --> 45:05.880
Many an end-user do not want to be bugged by big high and mighty terms and would like to understand how a certain technology works and so on and so forth.

45:05.880 --> 45:09.880
But what we do is different. We put technology in terms that people understand.

45:09.880 --> 45:18.880
We put it into fun casual manners so expect lots of weird examples and analogies involving toilet bowls and kitchen sinks. That's where we're different.

45:18.880 --> 45:24.880
We do not emphasize the news. Websites like Slashdot do that. We do not emphasize on reviews. Websites like Tom's Hardware does that.

45:24.880 --> 45:28.240
We emphasize on knowledge knowledge for the common end-user. I

45:30.760 --> 45:31.920
Thought that was pretty cool

45:31.920 --> 45:35.520
I kind of want to check that out that's almost like my teaching style too when I teach things

45:35.520 --> 45:40.400
I make all these crazy analogies to real life starts in my day job. I'm a teacher for a business

45:40.400 --> 45:44.840
so kind of interesting what impresses me is that they have an

45:45.360 --> 45:51.160
explanation on what leet and new bar and to quote this every article in the site will have a new bow meter and it

45:51.160 --> 45:54.800
It states how rudimentary the article is about.

45:54.800 --> 45:58.680
For example, if the noobometer is at an extreme noob end, then the article is just perfect

45:58.680 --> 45:59.680
for beginners.

45:59.680 --> 46:03.340
On the other hand, if the noobometer is at an extreme leet end, the article is for more

46:03.340 --> 46:04.340
leet users.

46:04.340 --> 46:06.200
Warning, extreme noobness ahead.

46:06.200 --> 46:07.200
Warning, warning.

46:07.200 --> 46:10.200
Remember, because being a noob ain't fun.

46:10.200 --> 46:13.080
This site instantly gets my uber kudos.

46:13.080 --> 46:16.720
All right, website of the week, leettech1337.

46:16.720 --> 46:19.280
Thank you, Dark Soccer.

46:19.280 --> 46:23.600
Let's go over to Loki, who has some news regarding piracy.

46:23.600 --> 46:35.960
Yeah, of course, no basically, I don't know, this whole thing with the 360 and the firmware

46:35.960 --> 46:42.320
for the DVD and stuff, just, I don't know, not a really good thing, but, another interesting

46:42.320 --> 46:46.000
thing though for those actual pirates out there who are trying to make some money by

46:46.000 --> 46:52.360
by selling those bootleg copies, while certain developers aren't going to actually take that

46:52.360 --> 46:53.720
lying down.

46:53.720 --> 46:59.440
There is a story about a Russian software developer who is literally going to beat up

46:59.440 --> 47:04.280
one of the pirates, and I thought that was kind of funny.

47:04.280 --> 47:12.280
And basically, he spotted his software for sale legally at a market in Moscow, and basically

47:12.280 --> 47:18.840
We got into a fight with him and now is going to take him to an actual boxing match.

47:18.840 --> 47:22.140
Wait, so the developer is actually going to...

47:22.140 --> 47:28.120
This is like celebrity boxing on Fox, in a way, is kind of what it reminds me of.

47:28.120 --> 47:29.680
In the main event!

47:29.680 --> 47:30.680
Interesting.

47:30.680 --> 47:32.180
Yeah, so...

47:32.180 --> 47:35.920
This will not be a fight night thing, this will be real life, right?

47:35.920 --> 47:38.240
Fight night, round four, against the pirates.

47:38.240 --> 47:39.520
No, I don't know.

47:39.520 --> 47:53.600
I thought Fight Night Round R. Alright, NVIDIA is the maker of popular graphics cards out

47:53.600 --> 47:54.600
there.

47:54.600 --> 47:55.600
Some of you have them in your very own PCs.

47:55.600 --> 48:00.680
Well, they announced this last week that they have a new design contract with Sony.

48:00.680 --> 48:05.720
They're going to get more money than what they earned for creating the graphics processor

48:05.720 --> 48:08.960
for the upcoming PlayStation 3 video game console.

48:08.960 --> 48:13.560
This deal is going to run through 2007, but the thing is that we don't really know what

48:13.560 --> 48:15.120
this chip is for.

48:15.120 --> 48:18.280
Could it be possibly about the PSP2?

48:18.280 --> 48:19.280
Who knows?

48:19.280 --> 48:23.640
They might be bragging about the deal, but they can't talk about the details just yet,

48:23.640 --> 48:25.260
so it could be just about anything.

48:25.260 --> 48:31.640
So Nvidia has a deal with Sony to make something, but we don't know what.

48:31.640 --> 48:35.080
I would likely say it's the PSP2.

48:35.080 --> 48:44.900
Once in a while, we like to hear back from our listeners and have you guys interact with

48:44.900 --> 48:49.840
us live on the program, and we do that using our Skype line.

48:49.840 --> 48:52.980
So to get more information on the Skype line, all you have to do is head on over to our

48:52.980 --> 48:58.580
website www.orangelaungeradio.com and click on interact with us and get all the details

48:58.580 --> 49:00.720
on contacting us on Skype.

49:00.720 --> 49:07.800
Please remember though, if you're going to call us on Skype, please call ECHO123 first

49:07.800 --> 49:09.760
to test your connection to make sure it works.

49:09.760 --> 49:15.480
You can also pick up the regular telephone and call us, 916-226-9067, but please keep

49:15.480 --> 49:21.100
in mind that that may be a toll call, so please have the phone line owner's permission before

49:21.100 --> 49:22.100
you call in.

49:22.100 --> 49:26.440
Also, we're going to be moving the Skype line on a bit more permanent basis towards

49:26.440 --> 49:30.540
the end of the show in response to recent feedback that our Skype line sometimes gets

49:30.540 --> 49:31.940
a little too random.

49:31.940 --> 49:35.540
So what we want this to be is more the end of the show kind of open forum.

49:35.540 --> 49:40.060
So for our callers to be able to discuss basically whatever is on their mind.

49:40.060 --> 49:44.820
There will be a more topical version of interaction that we'll announce in a later week.

49:44.820 --> 49:45.820
So here we go.

49:45.820 --> 49:46.820
We're going to go ahead and pick up the phone.

49:46.820 --> 49:47.820
Take our first call.

49:47.820 --> 49:48.820
Hi.

49:48.820 --> 49:49.820
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

49:49.820 --> 49:50.820
Hi.

49:50.820 --> 49:51.820
This is Simil.

49:51.820 --> 49:52.820
Hi, Simil.

49:52.820 --> 49:53.820
What's on your mind, buddy?

49:53.820 --> 49:58.820
Just a quick call, just about you actually badmassing the UK.

49:58.820 --> 50:03.820
Wait a minute, we're getting video of you here in the studio too, that is crazy.

50:03.820 --> 50:08.820
Look at this, we can actually see this guy who's calling in right now. I've never seen that happen on Skype before.

50:08.820 --> 50:09.820
That's pretty cool.

50:09.820 --> 50:10.820
That's kind of cool.

50:10.820 --> 50:14.820
I'm looking a bit tired because it's like half five now.

50:14.820 --> 50:16.820
It's got to be like five or six over there.

50:16.820 --> 50:19.820
Alright, what did we do to bash on the UK? I'm sorry bud, what did we do?

50:19.820 --> 50:23.820
Just about when Guitar Hero was...

50:23.820 --> 50:27.320
Yeah, Guitar Hero?

50:27.320 --> 50:30.500
I think the video may be slowing our connection there a little bit.

50:30.500 --> 50:36.580
You had a question there in response to Guitar Hero, were we bashing on it a little bit there

50:36.580 --> 50:37.580
or what?

50:37.580 --> 50:44.540
Yeah, just the fact that, yeah, I'm just trying to get rid of it.

50:44.540 --> 50:45.540
I gotta let that one go.

50:45.540 --> 50:50.060
I'm so sorry, Simo, but we just got really, really bad feedback there, and I think people's

50:50.060 --> 50:53.860
speakers exploded during that, so sorry about that.

50:53.860 --> 50:55.460
You guys should not bash on the UK.

50:55.460 --> 50:56.460
We don't!

50:56.460 --> 50:57.460
Shame on you!

50:57.460 --> 50:58.460
We weren't!

50:58.460 --> 51:02.900
I made a whole segment just to read UK news, thank you.

51:02.900 --> 51:07.700
It's probably my fault, because I was saying that Guitar Heroes was a little bit, like,

51:07.700 --> 51:11.100
I'm a little sick of it here, but I understand, no, I understand you guys are getting it for

51:11.100 --> 51:15.100
the first time over there in the UK, yes, you should check this game out, it's just

51:15.100 --> 51:20.300
that I am getting sick of hearing it in the US it's it's time for us to move on

51:20.300 --> 51:26.980
guess what what guitar hero let you call me when you've got guitar hero 2 to talk

51:26.980 --> 51:30.420

51:33.780 --> 51:41.100
Orange Lounge Radio. Hey! Hi, who's this? This is Roz. Hi Roz! Roz! Roz, what's on your mind?

52:16.300 --> 52:22.020
some it's not regular crack it's crack what other DS games are you into Roz

52:22.020 --> 52:26.340
Phoenix Wright you all know about my horrible Phoenix Wright addiction that's

52:26.340 --> 52:28.980
right I remember hearing about that a couple weeks ago on the show how is

52:28.980 --> 52:30.980
Phoenix Wright going? Have you beat it yet?

52:30.980 --> 52:32.980
Oh, like four times.

52:32.980 --> 52:34.980
Dang! Wow, very cool.

52:34.980 --> 52:36.980
Weren't you the one that had to drive a long ways

52:36.980 --> 52:38.980
to get it?

52:38.980 --> 52:40.980
Yeah, like six hours or so.

52:40.980 --> 52:42.980
That is hardcore, so I guess you have to beat a game

52:42.980 --> 52:44.980
four times after that type of dedication.

52:44.980 --> 52:46.980
Any other feedback to

52:46.980 --> 52:48.980
stories we've been talking about tonight, Roz?

52:48.980 --> 52:50.980
Tonight?

52:50.980 --> 52:52.980
I came in late.

52:52.980 --> 52:56.980
Let's see here.

52:56.980 --> 53:06.980
Well, that's okay. You'll just have to, you know, download the podcast so you can catch up on the first half, what you missed, or you can listen to our syndication on allgames.com, because they play our show in its entirety as well, so.

53:06.980 --> 53:12.980
Yeah, I was desperately trying to get my mic to work last week, uh, to talk about the, uh, whole girl gamers issue.

53:12.980 --> 53:18.980
Oh, sure, we can still talk about that. What's on your mind in regards to the girl gamer issue?

53:18.980 --> 53:29.140
Well, obviously not being a dude kind of pisses me off how, you know, the negative stereotypes

53:29.140 --> 53:35.780
and stuff, and I don't know, I just don't know what everyone's collective deal is.

53:35.780 --> 53:41.800
I mean, you know, it's always a big deal when people find out that I'm not a dude.

53:41.800 --> 53:46.860
People react in such weird ways sometimes to those sorts of little revelations.

53:46.860 --> 53:51.140
It's weird because I think MMOs make gaming more personal, Xbox Live and all that stuff

53:51.140 --> 53:54.780
makes gaming more personal and you want to find more about the people that you're playing

53:54.780 --> 53:59.320
the games with and people have all these preconceived notions.

53:59.320 --> 54:02.500
We talked about this a little bit last week so I don't want to rehash the old conversation

54:02.500 --> 54:05.600
but it's interesting nonetheless.

54:05.600 --> 54:09.780
But I also noticed and something that was being talked about in our forums a little

54:09.780 --> 54:13.760
bit was also that there's two extremes going on.

54:13.760 --> 54:19.580
You have the gamer babes websites, you know, that like, oh, there's all these hot gamers

54:19.580 --> 54:22.840
out there, and all girl gamers are really hot babes.

54:22.840 --> 54:26.720
But then somebody posted in our forums that they're really sick of people assuming that

54:26.720 --> 54:31.960
because they're a girl, they must be, you know, fat and ugly and have nothing else to

54:31.960 --> 54:34.640
do but play games, which is a bunch of crap.

54:34.640 --> 54:38.140
Sure there's fat and ugly people that play games, and sure there's beautiful people that

54:38.140 --> 54:39.780
play games, but you know what?

54:39.780 --> 54:44.380
Those are the two extremes, and this is what we call a bell curve.

54:44.380 --> 54:48.500
And most people are somewhere in between, you know, most of us are just, we're average

54:48.500 --> 54:49.500
looking.

54:49.500 --> 54:50.500
Yeah, pretty much.

54:50.500 --> 54:56.340
You know, I think that SSJ100 Matt actually just said it kind of best in the chat room.

54:56.340 --> 55:00.060
You know, most people are like, oh my god, you're a girl, ASL pics please.

55:00.060 --> 55:05.180
I get that crap on, not on the current Ragnarok that I'm playing on, because people are like,

55:05.180 --> 55:09.540
oh, you're cool, you're not a bot, but on IRO I got it all the time.

55:09.540 --> 55:27.540
Yeah, I moderate at a role-playing forum, and all of my characters are male, pretty much, and so when people find out that I'm not a guy, it tends to freak them out, and then I get, like, all these people pouring in on Messenger trying to, you know, hit on me.

55:27.540 --> 55:30.540
And that's invisible all the time.

55:30.540 --> 55:35.540
Don't you get people that assume you must be a lesbian because you play a male character? Because I've heard girls tell me that.

55:35.540 --> 55:36.540
I've had that.

55:36.540 --> 55:38.540
Yeah, it's so stupid. So stupid.

55:38.540 --> 55:42.540
Then again, how many female characters online are really, you know, boys?

55:42.540 --> 55:46.040
Exactly, and you know, we just had the emails from the,

55:46.040 --> 55:50.300
you know, the guys that play the girl characters because they are

55:50.300 --> 55:54.180
good characters in the games. It has nothing to do with, it's just, it's so silly.

55:54.180 --> 55:58.740
Yeah, it is. Alright, people need to put stereotypes aside. That's what they need to do.

55:58.740 --> 56:02.380
Alright, Roz, thank you so much for your call. Appreciate it. Yep.

56:02.380 --> 56:07.940
Alright, have a good one. Bye. Bye-bye. Alright, we're gonna go ahead and go to another call here. Let's go

56:37.940 --> 56:38.940
Was it?

56:38.940 --> 56:39.940
Yeah.

56:39.940 --> 56:40.940
Hi, Xander.

56:40.940 --> 56:41.940
No, it's Xander from Connecticut.

56:41.940 --> 56:42.940
Alright, Xander from Connecticut.

56:42.940 --> 56:43.940
What's on your mind?

56:43.940 --> 56:44.940
Um...

56:44.940 --> 56:45.940
Guitar Hero?

56:45.940 --> 56:46.940
No.

56:46.940 --> 56:47.940
Wait.

56:47.940 --> 56:48.940
That's...

56:48.940 --> 56:49.940
I'm not going to start that way.

56:49.940 --> 56:50.940
Yeah, please don't.

56:50.940 --> 56:51.940
Okay.

56:51.940 --> 56:53.940
You overrate Guitar Hero.

56:53.940 --> 56:54.940
Me?

56:54.940 --> 56:56.940
I overrate Guitar Hero?

56:56.940 --> 56:59.940
Well, everybody does, but...

56:59.940 --> 57:00.940
Yeah.

57:00.940 --> 57:01.940
Don't...

57:01.940 --> 57:04.940
How can one overrate one's own personal opinion of the game?

57:04.940 --> 57:05.940
Well, it's just like...

57:05.940 --> 57:06.940
Okay.

57:06.940 --> 57:09.840
with my personal opinion, and my personal opinion is God.

57:09.840 --> 57:12.460
I'm gonna hit you with a trap in a second.

57:12.460 --> 57:15.580
Okay, so what, you don't like Guitar Hero?

57:15.580 --> 57:17.780
No, I like it, it's just overrated.

57:17.780 --> 57:22.340
Okay, that's fair enough. I would say, yeah, I get a little weird when I see

57:22.340 --> 57:24.900
Guitar Hero winning all these innovation awards because

57:24.900 --> 57:29.420
I wonder if it's winning it for the right reasons, and I don't suspect it is.

57:29.420 --> 57:32.780
You know what I mean? Like, sure it's innovative when it comes to the, you know,

57:32.780 --> 57:35.380
fun factor and all the little in-game stuff,

57:35.380 --> 57:40.500
but the game itself is not a hugely original concept.

57:40.500 --> 57:44.580
It's a fusion of two existing concepts in my mind,

57:44.580 --> 57:47.940
and that doesn't make it a bad game. I love Guitar Hero, it's a great game,

57:47.940 --> 57:51.500
but I'm a little, you know, I'm kinda over it now, you know what I mean?

57:51.500 --> 57:54.820
It's time for me to move on to another music game for now.

57:54.820 --> 57:58.940
I think the reason it got so high scores though is because it got all that

57:58.940 --> 58:02.940
licensed music and crap on it. And I totally agree, and I think

58:02.940 --> 58:09.780
Konami made some mistakes in not having more faith in the U.S. audience and spending the

58:09.780 --> 58:13.680
money on some higher licenses when they came out here and I take my hats off to Red Octane

58:13.680 --> 58:20.180
for recognizing that and harmonics as well.

58:20.180 --> 58:23.860
We give Konami a lot of love on this show but we have to give them tough love too when

58:23.860 --> 58:25.660
the time is appropriate.

58:25.660 --> 58:28.260
So everybody deserves tough love I guess.

58:28.260 --> 58:29.260
I know.

58:29.260 --> 58:33.300
Anything else on your mind, Xander?

58:33.300 --> 58:40.620
On the girl gamer thingy, I just want to say I'm upset as a male asexual that I don't get

58:40.620 --> 58:41.620
bashed.

58:41.620 --> 58:46.580
Seriously, the gays get bashed, the girls get bashed, and crap.

58:46.580 --> 58:47.580
Why don't I get bashed?

58:47.580 --> 58:48.580
That's not fair.

58:48.580 --> 58:49.580
This is a term...

58:49.580 --> 58:50.580
We do secretly bash you.

58:50.580 --> 58:53.160
Okay, I bash you every night in the chat room.

58:53.160 --> 58:55.060
They're all talking about you behind your back.

58:55.060 --> 58:56.060
No, no, okay.

58:56.060 --> 58:58.920
Define this for me again, because this is a term that a lot of our podcast listeners

58:58.920 --> 59:00.020
are probably going, huh?

59:00.020 --> 59:02.620
You define yourself as asexual, which means?

59:02.620 --> 59:03.620
Yes.

59:03.620 --> 59:06.700
It means I'm an amoeba.

59:06.700 --> 59:08.260
Are you a eunuch?

59:08.260 --> 59:12.980
It means that he doesn't think about sex, period.

59:12.980 --> 59:17.300
Okay, because if you're eunuch, I was just going to say, you wouldn't have balls.

59:17.300 --> 59:21.380
Okay, just quiet over there, okay extrovert?

59:21.380 --> 59:22.380
All right.

59:22.380 --> 59:30.380
So, well, do you ever get asked in games, like ASL and all this, do you ever have people try to cyber flirt with you or whatever?

59:30.380 --> 59:32.380
I got sent coke music.

59:32.380 --> 59:35.380
Coke music? What happened in coke music?

59:35.380 --> 59:38.380
Um, I realized it sucked.

59:38.380 --> 59:41.380
Why? What happened? Were people hitting on you there?

59:41.380 --> 59:45.380
No, it just sucks. It only sucked. I just grew up a little.

59:45.380 --> 59:46.380
Okay, okay.

59:46.380 --> 59:51.380
Alright, well, can anybody think of a good insult for the asexual gamer?

59:51.380 --> 59:53.380
I think I already did.

59:53.380 --> 59:55.380
You're a nookulous freak!

59:55.380 --> 59:58.380
How's that? Does that count?

59:58.380 --> 01:00:01.380
Does that make you feel better to be bashed there, Xander, a little bit?

01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:02.380
I guess.

01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:04.380
Okay, well, we appreciate your call.

01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:06.380
I don't bash on anybody.

01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:10.380
Have a good night and have fun not getting laid, okay?

01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:11.380
Okay.

01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:12.380
Alright, later.

01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:14.380
Let's go to one more call.

01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:18.280
all right we better set aside ten minutes Zaku's on the line Zaku what's

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:23.340
on your mind yes remember that link I sent you last week about how MTV

01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:29.080
interview this suppose you know this DDR player from around my area I just want

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:33.900
to just want to know whether or not you know you got a chance to even look at it

01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:41.280
I'm gonna be honest I didn't all right send me the post post it in chat I will

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:48.000
Again, but honestly, you know if you take a look at it, you know, and personally I think you know

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.220
MTV did a good job in doing it

01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:53.500
I wouldn't say they did the best but it's not like you know

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:56.720
They didn't do a lame-ass attempt in trying to try it

01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:01.280
You know trying to feed on the stereotype of DDR being a healthy thing said just fit

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:05.120
Okay, set this up for me a little bit exactly what is in this clip if I want if I watch this clip

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:11.200
What am I gonna get you're going to see a you know a DDR player by the name of Anthony also known as sketch

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:16.000
He's one of these one of the best DDR players in the city, and he was interviewed

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.480
He was picked. You know he was interviewed by MTV for overdrive

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:26.080
basically you're gonna see a lot of you know a lot you know a lot of how you know a lot of the the

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:30.140
Perspective of you know you know the hardcore DDR player

01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:36.360
The one who basically goes after scores and just you know, it just goes after perfecting, you know

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:44.420
There are their skills not necessarily, you know, not you know, it's not even focused at all on the whole healthy aspect of it

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:49.540
All right more game. It's it's a gamer perspective of the game. All right that way Zaku

01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:54.520
We will check out the clip during our afterbirth. How's that sound? Yeah. All right, we'll do that man. All right, Zaku

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:56.780
Have a good one. Thanks for calling in. All right later

01:01:56.780 --> 01:02:08.780
I say get the British guy back on the line, he didn't give him enough time, I mean his connection, but British people, their voices are cool, and you know, we need more coolness.

01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:16.780
Well, we gotta go ahead and close the Skype line for now, but if he calls in next week, we'll definitely get him again, and he can yell at me more over Guitar Girl.

01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:20.780
I think it's cool that he stays up till five, six in the morning listening to us.

01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:21.780
I know, that's dedication.

01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:26.820
Well, you know that over on All Games where they syndicate us, they play us at different

01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:29.460
times of the day, on Tuesday and Wednesday.

01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:34.880
So I think on Tuesday we're played in the morning, so that might be a different time.

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:39.340
So those that want the live experience to kind of listen to this as it goes on can listen

01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:42.620
at those times, too, and that can help adjust for time zones.

01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:44.180
So something to think about.

01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:45.180
Okay.

01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:47.580
All right.

01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:50.580
Let's go on and get to the last couple stories here.

01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:55.340
Something hitting some of the blogs this week about a Famicom game that's really crazy even

01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:58.060
though Famicom is about what, 20 years old here?

01:02:58.060 --> 01:02:59.060
Exactly.

01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:02.020
Well, when you think of crazy stuff, what do you think of?

01:03:02.020 --> 01:03:04.420
At least what I think of crazy Japanese stuff.

01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:09.780
I think of MXC, better known as Takashi's Castle.

01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:13.460
Who stars in Takashi's Castle but beat Takashi.

01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:18.260
And beat Takashi made a game called Takashi's Challenge.

01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:23.660
basically the game is kind of it kind of ties in with the bus driving minigame in

01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:30.060
the Penn and Teller game but they have such it's basically the game is made by

01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:35.660
a man who hates video games it says Takashi's challenge puts the players

01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:40.980
through hell like forcing the player to sing karaoke continuously stare at the

01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:45.660
stare at a blank monitor pilot a plane that can't go up and then hit the final

01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:48.060
boss 20,000 times.

01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:51.620
Was this a for real video game that was released, or was this some weirdo one, man?

01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:55.500
Apparently Taito released it back in 1986.

01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:56.860
Okay.

01:03:56.860 --> 01:03:58.940
Dot, dot, dot.

01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:05.140
Taito is the same cracked out company that gave us Bubble Bobble.

01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:06.140
This is true.

01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:09.620
Alright, any last minute stories you guys want to bring up before we get into the final

01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:11.940
story of the night?

01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:14.100
I'm sure I've got something here.

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:15.100
to do

01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:16.460
uh...

01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:21.500
uh... belfield to demo that was was to come out uh... no twenty fourth

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:22.660
yeah

01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:24.180
uh...

01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:26.480
about that uh...

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:30.660
you know what's up liar it got pushed back is the i'd love to be liar the week

01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:34.940
no he is a lawyer that he has pushed it back and says the come outs on the

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:37.220
twenty-eighth

01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:38.620
our twenty nine i'm sorry

01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:39.620
uh... between

01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:41.740
between twenty at the same

01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:47.420
It's just sometime Tuesday and Wednesday, so maybe about like eight o'clock Tuesday night is like partial in between there

01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:49.740
Hey, listen, you got burnout and freaking

01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:54.960
Blazing angels. So play those while you're waiting. All right. I would yes, sir

01:04:56.100 --> 01:05:00.740
Well, I have something. Okay. This is from old grandma hardcore. Oh

01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:04.820
Yes, her that the granny gamer the granny game love her

01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:09.460
Basically, there is a chronicle out on YouTube now

01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:18.480
And the link is up at ogrannyhardcore.blogspot.com, about how she has laid down some massive,

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:22.540
massive ownage at brain training.

01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:29.420
And apparently, there was actually a few of the other people who were playing who actually

01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:32.240
said that drinking helped their scores improve.

01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:38.660
But Granny had finished her game while the little girl was still going past the time

01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:39.660
limit.

01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:40.660
Wow.

01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:43.460
So, yeah, and there's a movie file up here, so I'm going to share that with our chat

01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:53.540
room, but if you go to oghc.blogspot.com, the link is up there for the week of March 20th.

01:05:53.540 --> 01:05:54.540
Very cool.

01:05:54.540 --> 01:06:01.220
All right, I got one last story for you guys here tonight, and it has to do with, I'm sure

01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:05.460
a TV show that our folks that listen to us live don't watch, because it's on the same

01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:09.180
time as our program, but it does have to do with gaming, believe it or not.

01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:14.480
Walt Disney's Buena Vista Games said this week that it is going to be releasing a PC

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:22.900
video game based on the television show Desperate Housewives this fall.

01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:28.660
In the game, you will be taking on the role of a new housewife who can either create new

01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:35.540
Scandals uncover existing ones over on wisteria lane the street where the show takes place now

01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:41.300
They're saying that Brenda strong who's in the series as the voice of Mary Alice Young who's like the dead wife

01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:43.960
She's signed on for a similar role in the game

01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:47.500
They are negotiating with the other cast members to try and appear in the game

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:51.380
So if you've ever wanted to be a desperate housewife, here's your chance

01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:57.940
Something tells me those guys that emailed us saying they like to play us the girls something tell

01:06:57.940 --> 01:07:00.900
so something tells me they'll take a pass on this one

01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:02.860
call it a hunch

01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:05.380
Loki don't you watch Desperate Housewives?

01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:05.880
no i don't

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:06.980
oh I thought you did

01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:09.980
no Nellie watches Desperate Housewives

01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:12.980
I do not watch Desperate Housewives

01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:14.700
I don't either

01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:17.100
I may have been forced to watch the first season of Desperate Housewives

01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:18.920
but that's where it stops

01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:20.280
we can't

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:21.800
our show is on the same time here on the west coast

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:23.820
so we can't watch it even if we wanted to

01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:24.320
which I don't

01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:26.320
You can watch it.

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:58.320
what what what the hell's her name Gabrielle Carteris no no that was the

01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:00.120
chick in 90210

01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:03.600
I know. Same show

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:08.280
what the hell's, oh Eva Longoria that she plays somebody I think

01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:12.080
she plays Gabrielle on the show how the hell do I know that okay Eva Longoria

01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:15.440
right she's she's the hot one on the show you know I'm sure

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:19.800
a lot of guys wanna you know I guess I don't know you know what forget it

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:22.920
let's let's just end the show let's quit while we're ahead

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:25.920
Uh, and we're gonna go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:26.920
Loki, your final thought.

01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:31.920
My final thought is I just read another story that's yet pointing to Nintendo doing VR.

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:36.920
But, it's just rumor stories. I hate rumor stories.

01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:38.920
Six weeks, Loki. You can wait.

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:39.920
No, I can't.

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:41.920
Extafer, your final thought.

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:48.920
Um, to all the girl-babe gamers out there, preach on, brothers. I mean, sistas.

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:58.080
I'm going to pass on the reject false icons this week in order to describe a beverage

01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:03.680
called the pangalactic gargle blaster.

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:07.440
It says the effect of the pangalactic gargle blaster is like having your brain smashed

01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:10.600
out by a slice of lemon wrapped around a large gold brick.

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:14.320
I need one of those right now.

01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:19.220
My final thought would be, I really suck at Geometry Wars and I'm never going to get better

01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:22.980
and that makes me a sad gamer.

01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:26.080
