00:19.500 --> 00:26.100
And we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this March 19th, 2006, episode number 177.

00:26.100 --> 00:29.600
Thank you guys so much for downloading our podcast, checking us out.

00:33.760 --> 00:34.920
show tonight.

00:34.920 --> 00:39.600
Speaking of AllGames.com, they've got something pretty big that they're airing this week and

00:39.600 --> 00:43.320
it has to do with video game music, which the folks listening live heard during the

00:43.320 --> 00:45.020
break there.

00:45.020 --> 00:50.120
They're actually going to be airing the fourth annual Game Audio Network Guild Awards and

00:50.120 --> 00:51.520
that's going to be on AllGames Radio.

00:51.520 --> 00:53.000
That's AllGames.com.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.800
That's Thursday night at 11 p.m. Eastern, 8 p.m. Pacific, but they're going to have

00:56.800 --> 01:02.080
a pre-show as well, so just tune in at 6pm Pacific and you'll be good.

01:02.080 --> 01:06.860
They're actually going to have performing at the show this Guitar Hero Band.

01:06.860 --> 01:11.600
And what they've done is they've actually gotten heroes of guitar playing to perform

01:11.600 --> 01:12.600
at this band.

01:12.600 --> 01:15.160
I don't want to read the entire list here, you guys can go to allgames.com and check

01:15.160 --> 01:19.800
it out, but get this, Lyle Workman, who's a guitar player for Sting and Beck, and they

01:19.800 --> 01:24.880
have Daryl Anders, who's the bassist for Tower of Power and Bonnie Hayes.

01:24.880 --> 01:30.240
They also have Marcus Henderson, who's the guitar player for Drist and En Vogue, and

01:30.240 --> 01:34.680
they just have like all these standout stars there that are going to be performing in this

01:34.680 --> 01:35.680
band.

01:35.680 --> 01:36.680
So that should be kind of fun.

01:36.680 --> 01:40.440
So check that out, they're going to be airing that live over on All Games, our buddies over

01:40.440 --> 01:41.440
there.

01:41.440 --> 01:44.720
All right, so let's get into some news.

01:44.720 --> 01:48.860
Last segment we talked about Katamari Damacy ending, sad.

01:48.860 --> 01:52.840
We also talked about some big lies going around in the industry right now.

01:52.840 --> 01:54.000
Big stinky ones.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.500
And now we're going to talk about some big acquisitions and things of that nature.

01:57.500 --> 01:58.500
Loki, what's up?

01:58.500 --> 02:03.280
Yes, tis the season to buy a company smaller than yours.

02:03.280 --> 02:07.900
Starting off here with THQ, they're acquiring Vigil Games.

02:07.900 --> 02:14.560
For those probably not very familiar with Vigil Games, they created both Marvel's Uncanny

02:14.560 --> 02:18.900
X-Men and Battle Chasers series.

02:18.900 --> 02:25.680
And so, I don't know, it's part of the studio system strategy, which is designed to foster

02:25.680 --> 02:34.280
a singular vision and unique culture at each of our studios, according to Jack Sorensen,

02:34.280 --> 02:38.600
the executive vice president of the worldwide studios at THQ.

02:38.600 --> 02:45.000
And it's basically to inject more of that creativity into their games, I guess, where

02:45.000 --> 02:47.120
it may be lacking.

02:47.120 --> 02:53.120
Yeah, you know what? Actually, now that I think of it, THQ did create, I want to say, the outfit.

02:53.120 --> 02:55.120
I don't know, that game was pretty fun.

02:55.120 --> 02:59.120
Anyways, speaking of bigger fish in the pond, Sony.

02:59.120 --> 03:04.120
They've signed a deal with PlayLogic for future first-party games.

03:04.120 --> 03:07.120
And that should be pretty interesting.

03:07.120 --> 03:10.120
Now, unfortunately, they haven't said what the game was.

03:10.120 --> 03:16.120
But it is slated to come out on the PSP PlayStation 2, or possibly the PlayStation 3.

03:16.120 --> 03:21.240
that's involved with Sony, but will be a first party game, so should be pretty cool.

03:21.240 --> 03:26.360
And then finally, EA is actually going to be purchasing Battlefield Developer Digital

03:26.360 --> 03:30.440
Illusion CE, better known as DICE.

03:30.440 --> 03:34.580
And I think that's definitely a good move for them, seeing as Battlefield 2 has been

03:34.580 --> 03:39.560
pretty successful, and especially since the 360 version is coming out next month, so.

03:39.560 --> 03:42.560
That's right, and that's what I've got a story on, right here.

03:42.560 --> 03:47.560
Battlefield 2 the demo is going to be coming out on March 24th over on Xbox live

03:47.560 --> 03:51.640
The demo is actually going to have up to 24 players being able to play online

03:51.960 --> 03:55.240
So this is kind of cool that a lot of the Xbox live demos lately have been

03:56.040 --> 03:57.600
You know these

03:57.600 --> 04:03.920
Big multiplayer things like the outfit and all that stuff so game even though they're not my type of games like I really tried

04:03.920 --> 04:06.800
You guys I try to play battlefield 2 because everybody was just raving about it

04:06.800 --> 04:11.960
But it's just it's just not my type of game. So you know maybe I'll check it out on Xbox live hell if it's free

04:11.960 --> 04:16.820
Why not? I'll check it out, but I'm gonna suck and I'm gonna be I'm gonna be a detriment to any team

04:16.820 --> 04:22.540
I'm on but check that out and it's it's coming out for the Xbox 360 in April. Yes

04:23.140 --> 04:27.800
April the I'll say like the 11th or 12th now, so pretty soon just around the corner

04:28.100 --> 04:32.400
Also some other quick news on Xbox Live you heard us in part a Loki was talking about feeding frenzy

04:32.400 --> 04:34.400
That's out now on the Xbox Live Arcade

04:34.620 --> 04:39.660
Also available on Xbox Live you can download now the Natasha betting field video for unwritten

04:39.660 --> 04:42.660
Which is kind of interesting because now Xbox is starting to get into...

04:42.660 --> 04:44.660
It's like Artist of the Month thing?

04:44.660 --> 04:47.660
Yeah, they're doing this Artist of the Month thing, so it's kind of like to promote music.

04:47.660 --> 04:51.660
But I have to say, I actually downloaded the video, because I kind of like Natasha Bedingfield, she's okay.

04:51.660 --> 04:54.660
And the video looks great in High Def.

04:54.660 --> 04:57.660
So that's kind of cool that they're making the music videos in High Def now.

04:57.660 --> 05:01.660
And I haven't watched MTV in forever, so I didn't even know that they were making music videos in High Def.

05:01.660 --> 05:02.660
But I guess that makes sense.

05:02.660 --> 05:06.660
Just real quick, the Xbox Live Top 10 games of the week.

05:06.660 --> 05:10.980
10 needs first speed most wanted, 9 the outfit demo, 8 Battlefield 2

05:10.980 --> 05:14.220
which is amazing because how is that already there

05:14.220 --> 05:17.880
when the games, or is it the old one, I'm thinking the old one on Xbox

05:17.880 --> 05:20.900
yeah that's what it is okay and then 7

05:20.900 --> 05:24.020
Project Gotham Racing 3, 6 Dead or Alive 4

05:24.020 --> 05:29.100
5 Perfect Dark Zero, 4 EA Sports Fight Night Round 3, 3 Call of Duty 2

05:29.100 --> 05:32.460
2 Ghost Recon 3 and number 1 is still Halo 2

05:32.460 --> 05:36.740
Should we start a betting pool on when Halo 2 will actually be dethroned?

05:36.740 --> 05:41.900
Halo 3? Yeah, Halo 3. Most likely. Actually, you know, to be honest, I don't think it is

05:41.900 --> 05:43.660
gonna be Halo 3. I think it will be God,

05:43.660 --> 05:47.060
or Gears of War will dethrone it.

05:47.060 --> 05:51.060
It's a pretty bold assessment right there. Gears of War, pray.

05:51.060 --> 05:54.540
Both those are going to be extremely good. In my heart, it never made it that far.

05:54.540 --> 05:59.820
And notice, amidst all that Xbox Live news, not a single word

05:59.820 --> 06:03.620
on when we're getting that Street Fighter. Was it supposed to come out late March?

06:03.620 --> 06:08.260
I think the 24th was the day. We got 10 days! 10 days Capcom!

06:08.260 --> 06:11.500
Xbox, get that stuff out there. I wanna play it.

06:11.500 --> 06:15.340
Alright, I want my achievement points for beating the game with Chun-Li a hundred times.

06:15.340 --> 06:18.820
Well, I heard that the reason why it wasn't out yet is because they're having trouble

06:18.820 --> 06:19.580
with lag.

06:19.580 --> 06:23.100
Lots of lag. Or that part of lag.

06:23.100 --> 06:26.860
Fine, if they have to spend extra time to make it work good then that's fine

06:26.860 --> 06:29.540
because we don't want them releasing it and just patching it later to make up for it.

06:29.540 --> 06:33.460
That's fine, but a status check would be nice, guys.

06:33.460 --> 06:37.020
Alright, moving on to another

06:37.020 --> 06:40.340
completely different topic, Dark Sakura. We talked about Silent Hill a little bit

06:40.340 --> 06:41.380
in part A, but this is

06:41.380 --> 06:46.180
not about the movie necessarily, kinda sorta. There's actually

06:46.180 --> 06:49.820
a talk from OneUp stating that

06:49.820 --> 06:53.300
there's going to be a Silent Hill remake

06:53.300 --> 06:58.980
on the PS2. Konami's been all happy over the

06:58.980 --> 07:01.940
you know, the talk about the movie so there's a

07:01.940 --> 07:06.060
rumor that they are going to re-release

07:06.060 --> 07:10.700
the first game though with Harry Mason's wife who is the

07:10.700 --> 07:15.720
heroine of the movie. So it does have to do with the movie after all, so...

07:15.720 --> 07:19.540
Yeah, it's sort of a tie-in. I think that that's a good idea but

07:19.540 --> 07:22.900
you know, they'd have to make some changes

07:22.900 --> 07:26.020
It'd have to be an alternate universe sort of thing.

07:26.020 --> 07:29.300
Wouldn't that have to kind of come out like very soon

07:29.300 --> 07:32.200
if they wanted to promote the movie or maybe they're gonna wait for the DVD

07:32.200 --> 07:32.840
release?

07:32.840 --> 07:36.220
Wait for the DVD release? Because you want to see how well the movie does first

07:36.220 --> 07:37.700
before you go and make a game about it.

07:37.700 --> 07:41.220
Wouldn't that be a great combo pack though? DVD and game? No.

07:41.220 --> 07:46.020
Why not? I think they've tried it. Sony does that. Oh no, I'm thinking of the PS3.

07:46.020 --> 07:50.580
Yeah! Sony did do that once. They did, oh what was it? Stealth in the Wipeout Stealth.

07:50.580 --> 07:54.000
which woo! No, that didn't sell very well. My bad, sorry.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.620
By the way, it still sucked. I'll take your word for it.

07:57.620 --> 08:00.660
Is this something you'd probably check out, Jamie, being a fan of Silent Hill?

08:00.660 --> 08:04.940
Oh, of course. Yeah, I think I would too. Absolutely. Even though remakes can be a little

08:04.940 --> 08:08.020
and sometimes, I mean, sometimes they're really good, and I think back to, of course, Mario

08:08.020 --> 08:10.220
Brothers All-Stars on the greatest remakes they ever did.

08:10.220 --> 08:14.140
Hello? Alright, it was a big week for announcements,

08:14.140 --> 08:19.260
especially if you're rare, right, Loki? I don't know if you'd call it big, but

08:19.260 --> 08:22.880
well i don't know it's it's different for those who say that xbox 360 is all

08:22.880 --> 08:25.620
about shooters and racing games

08:25.620 --> 08:27.620
xbox 360 is also

08:27.620 --> 08:29.180
all about

08:29.180 --> 08:32.940
crap and that is what is coming out from Rare

08:32.940 --> 08:39.940
they announced a game called viva pinata yes hooray pinatas it's a game

08:40.100 --> 08:43.380
which is going to have a cartoon based on it

08:43.380 --> 08:46.620
about a living island of pinatas

08:46.620 --> 08:49.500
And what, may you ask, pinatas do?

08:49.500 --> 08:55.060
Well, they have to fix this garden that has kind of gone awry,

08:55.060 --> 09:00.820
and you have to lure your fellow pinatas to your garden.

09:00.820 --> 09:04.060
So that's what that second to last VG Cats was about.

09:04.060 --> 09:06.620
I didn't get it.

09:06.620 --> 09:07.780
It just all came together.

09:07.780 --> 09:08.860
It just dawned on me.

09:08.860 --> 09:10.140
Oh my god, it was so much fun.

09:10.140 --> 09:12.860
So what is this, Xbox's response to Animal Crossing, right?

09:12.860 --> 09:16.060
Is the easy way to put it?

09:16.060 --> 09:21.120
They're trying to make a Pokemon and goddamn it. They're gonna be damned if it'll happen cuz aren't they just supposed to do like a

09:21.120 --> 09:29.180
TV show in all night. Oh, yeah, oh boy a TV show now if I count pinatas if I come into a town of Evo

09:29.180 --> 09:33.460
Pinata and start regulating with a baseball bat will I get lots of candy no

09:33.460 --> 09:38.760
This is the only way I'd want this game to come out if you could play a little kid who fucking goes around the giant

09:38.760 --> 09:43.620
Stick and beats the shit out of these stupid animals and steals their candy that is the game

09:43.620 --> 09:46.380
I want okay grand theft pinata at one

09:46.380 --> 09:52.500
I have to ask why all this hate for Viva pinata before you have you seen the website?

09:53.500 --> 09:57.980
Seriously, have you seen the way I saw screenshots. I have not seen the website in the web

09:57.980 --> 10:04.660
No, I have not seen the website. The website is like some Shrek wannabe crap. These characters come out

10:04.700 --> 10:10.340
They even know like what the hell a game based on pinatas. I mean, it's seriously I

10:10.340 --> 10:13.620
I don't know it sounds like it could be innovative

10:13.620 --> 10:16.900
but the way they're doing like you know Xbox Live where you can

10:16.900 --> 10:20.420
you know communicate with other players and send your pinatas to their

10:20.420 --> 10:23.780
stuff to kinda make it like Animal Crossing type of thing

10:23.780 --> 10:27.020
but really it looks stupid

10:27.020 --> 10:30.220
it looks stupid then

10:30.220 --> 10:34.060
we have chat chatters that disagrees andersy in our term says Viva Pinata

10:34.060 --> 10:35.540
looks awesome seriously

10:35.540 --> 10:39.980
is it just because maybe this isn't your kinda thing

10:39.980 --> 10:42.740
No. It was Penny Arcade, not VGCats by the way.

10:42.740 --> 10:47.100
Oh. Penny Arcade. Their comic was hilarious. But no seriously,

10:47.100 --> 10:51.900
I have seen the website. I watched the little flash video that they have where they're

10:51.900 --> 10:53.900
like doing like screen tests of this

10:53.900 --> 10:58.500
you know, Viva Pinata thing. It looks like it's a bad Pixar movie gone awry.

10:58.500 --> 11:01.780
And I don't know, it could be cool.

11:01.780 --> 11:05.140
They could come out of nowhere, make it cool, but you know what? I think this is just gonna be

11:05.140 --> 11:06.300
another failed attempt

11:06.300 --> 11:12.660
Like cameo because cameo to be honest wasn't that great of a game. It was supposed to be a Zelda killer wasn't it quite

11:12.660 --> 11:18.580
No, it's not as early. It's it's an okay game. It's you know, it's pretty much if you're an adventure gamer person

11:18.580 --> 11:20.580
It's pretty much your only choice right now and it's okay

11:20.580 --> 11:25.300
It just it feels like it could have been done on the regular. It feels like there's really

11:26.260 --> 11:28.260
Fable was almost just the same

11:28.740 --> 11:30.740
type of thing in many ways

11:30.740 --> 11:34.580
Props are rare for at least trying something different.

11:34.580 --> 11:38.020
The only problem is, I don't like the idea how they're putting out this cartoon thing

11:38.020 --> 11:43.140
to go with it, because all they're trying to do is like, well kids like cartoons, cartoons

11:43.140 --> 11:47.520
sold Pokemon, let's, I mean, I don't know.

11:47.520 --> 11:52.020
You know what, I applaud them for doing something different besides the usual Xbox fare which

11:52.020 --> 11:57.540
turns a lot of people off to the system, which is sports, shooters, you know, and all those

11:57.540 --> 12:01.500
types of games you know we need we need some more variety in the Xbox lineup so

12:01.500 --> 12:05.420
I'm happy they're trying. Rare needs to just put out another goddamn killer

12:05.420 --> 12:11.420
instincts game. Can they though? I don't think they can. Well fine make something

12:11.420 --> 12:15.300
else that's similar. Alright. Just make another fighting game or something or

12:15.300 --> 12:19.740
put out something really good I mean seriously go to the website if you think

12:19.740 --> 12:23.540
I'm you know lying about how crappy this game is go to the website. Which most of our chat

12:23.540 --> 12:27.260
room does disagree with me. Okay and go to the website, watch the video and tell me if

12:27.260 --> 12:31.740
you're not pissed off at this game after you watch the video. Seriously.

12:31.740 --> 12:35.600
I want a pinata game like a first-person shooter, so you go around and shoot the pinatas and

12:35.600 --> 12:39.220
then you have to go get the candy. Get candy! That'd be awesome.

12:39.220 --> 12:43.940
Alright, I sense all this rage coming from Loki over there, so I think it's time to do

12:43.940 --> 12:50.180
our FUs of the week. DarkSakura, are you ready to inject some rage into this episode of Orange

12:50.180 --> 12:52.180
Launch Radio? Shut up and play the music!

12:52.180 --> 12:53.180
Alright.

12:53.180 --> 12:54.180
Sigh.

12:54.180 --> 13:17.740
My FU of the week goes towards education because I've been having to deal with, I dropped a

13:17.740 --> 13:24.820
and then I have a she's such a smart lady a great teacher but she tells us

13:24.820 --> 13:27.740
there's this assignment due and the assignments on the assignment page it's

13:27.740 --> 13:31.620
just read chapter so what do you do you know it just bugs me that there's this

13:31.620 --> 13:37.020
expectation that we don't have lives outside of class so we are given just

13:37.020 --> 13:41.060
buttloads of homework to do and some of us work full-time so what's up with that

13:41.060 --> 13:47.060
and it's not a very big F.U. but that's what's been on my mind.

13:47.060 --> 13:50.060
Alright. Loki, your F.U.

13:50.060 --> 13:53.060
My F.U. is the bad driver, so get this.

13:53.060 --> 13:59.060
I was driving down the freeway today, going to go check out Tux's for the wedding,

13:59.060 --> 14:03.060
and I see some dumbass pulling off to the side of the road.

14:03.060 --> 14:08.060
He's like, because he missed his, you know, intersection or turn or whatever, off the freeway.

14:08.060 --> 14:12.300
the friggin idiot starts backing up on the freeway

14:12.300 --> 14:15.420
backing up! flip the goddamn thing in the reverse!

14:15.420 --> 14:19.700
who was driving? oh god damn woman in a fucking SUV!

14:19.700 --> 14:23.900
bad! bad people! was she on her phone?

14:23.900 --> 14:29.060
oh she probably was but I didn't bother to look because there's a giant trail of smoke

14:29.060 --> 14:29.540
from her

14:29.540 --> 14:34.560
skidding into the god damn side of the road there. stupid people out there

14:34.560 --> 14:36.560
And I see it daily!

14:37.560 --> 14:39.560
Grrrr! Curses!

14:39.560 --> 14:46.560
Um, my FU would go to weekends, or should I say actually the work week, because weekends aren't long enough.

14:46.560 --> 14:53.560
I really feel like I haven't done, I mean, don't get me wrong, I've actually done a lot, a lot of stuff this weekend, but not enough.

14:53.560 --> 15:00.560
I kind of wish there was more time in the weekend, because I really have had no time to just kind of lie on the couch and go,

15:00.560 --> 15:04.280
I'm just relaxed in the day. So F you to

15:05.120 --> 15:09.400
Our society only allowing us two days on the week with weekend. I think that's crap. I

15:09.920 --> 15:13.540
Think we should work for two days in a week and get a five-day weekend though. We rock

15:15.040 --> 15:17.040
Of course, I'm just lazy. Oh

15:17.440 --> 15:20.080
I'm still on the topic of pinata by the way

15:20.660 --> 15:23.960
They still can't get over that pinata thing. I'll have Grand Theft pinata

15:24.680 --> 15:26.680
Metal Gear pinata. Mm-hmm

15:26.680 --> 15:28.680
Katamari piñata.

15:30.680 --> 15:31.680
Fun.

15:31.680 --> 15:34.680
They always take one gag a week and run with it, don't they, in chat?

15:34.680 --> 15:38.680
You did not just bring up the Viva Piñata website over there.

15:40.680 --> 15:42.680
Oh my god.

15:42.680 --> 15:45.680
Ooh, it does look like a Shrek ripoff. Wow.

15:45.680 --> 15:47.680
Yeah. Well, we'll see. I'll check it out later.

15:47.680 --> 15:48.680
That's so funny!

15:48.680 --> 15:49.680
I'll check it out later. We'll see.

15:49.680 --> 15:51.680
Anyway, I want to get onto another topic here.

15:51.680 --> 15:54.680
Kotaku.com has recently posted some images...

15:54.680 --> 15:57.820
images what pinata Mamie

15:57.820 --> 16:02.180
to do that I think you're laughing at Kotaku like that's not very nice there

16:02.180 --> 16:03.280
they're respected site

16:03.280 --> 16:07.600
I Kotaku.com recently posted some pictures you have to go back to

16:07.600 --> 16:12.240
March 15th though of the Game Boy Advance SP

16:12.240 --> 16:16.880
in pretty pink now with a brighter backlit screen or should I say

16:16.880 --> 16:20.560
pearly pink is actually the color they're going for there

16:20.560 --> 16:26.560
I don't know. Why do you think that they might be trying to release a pink Game Boy?

16:26.560 --> 16:30.560
They're not getting enough female players.

16:30.560 --> 16:36.560
All females buy anything that's pink. It's bred into their DNA.

16:36.560 --> 16:39.560
I know a lot of males that would be interested in the pink system.

16:39.560 --> 16:42.560
I know a lot of males that would be interested in the pink system.

16:42.560 --> 16:49.920
They're just not the typical mindset that a lot of game companies cater to.

16:49.920 --> 16:50.920
Let's just leave it at that.

16:50.920 --> 16:55.960
My Game Boy Advance, however, was pink, because I did it just so that, you know, people couldn't

16:55.960 --> 16:57.960
pin me down to any one particular thing.

16:57.960 --> 16:58.960
Gotcha.

16:58.960 --> 16:59.960
Yeah.

16:59.960 --> 17:00.960
Okay.

17:00.960 --> 17:02.560
I also have an afterburner in it.

17:02.560 --> 17:03.560
All right.

17:03.560 --> 17:06.600
I really only brought that up so we could tie into our next story that's going to be

17:06.600 --> 17:08.920
brought to us by Dark Sakura.

17:08.920 --> 17:09.920
Yep.

17:09.920 --> 17:11.840
It's actually our website of the week.

17:11.840 --> 17:18.840
Our website of the week! Well, here we go then. Let's bring in the theme music.

17:19.720 --> 17:23.240
You like to surf the internet and find a great website for us every week, don't you?

17:23.240 --> 17:28.720
Actually, this one was linked to me by a friend of mine.

17:28.720 --> 17:31.160
It's on The Escapist

17:31.160 --> 17:35.800
and the article can be found at www.escapistmagazine.com

17:35.800 --> 17:50.060
And I'll go ahead and read off just the first paragraph, it's by somebody named Whitney

17:50.060 --> 17:51.060
Butts.

17:51.060 --> 17:54.820
It says, I am a girl on the internet, yes I said it, a girl on the internet, there really

17:54.820 --> 17:59.100
are quite a few of us, I can type, I can play games with the best of you, and you my friend

17:59.100 --> 18:02.360
were about to get owned by a girl.

18:02.360 --> 18:09.160
It's basically the story of somebody who's been playing World of Warcraft and no one

18:09.160 --> 18:13.240
believed that she was a girl or thought that she was a girl speaking for her boyfriend

18:13.240 --> 18:16.680
on the chat or was not.

18:16.680 --> 18:17.680
She's very pretty.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.680
There's a picture of her on the site.

18:19.680 --> 18:26.000
I read the article when you posted it on our secret place that we put all the stories up.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.880
I read it and I thought it was very interesting.

18:29.880 --> 18:33.160
the IRC conversations that she posted in those chat logs.

18:33.160 --> 18:35.360
I was like, I actually wanted to do it.

18:35.360 --> 18:36.600
We didn't have enough time to prepare it,

18:36.600 --> 18:38.760
but I actually wanted to do IRC theater

18:38.760 --> 18:40.920
where we were gonna interact the dialogue here.

18:40.920 --> 18:44.320
But it's just amazing, the, for lack of a better word,

18:44.320 --> 18:45.640
stupidity of people.

18:45.640 --> 18:48.920
And my mother used to use this term a lot

18:48.920 --> 18:50.280
and I hated it then, but it's the only way

18:50.280 --> 18:53.680
I can think of to describe this hardheadedness

18:53.680 --> 18:57.960
of the youth that OMG, she's a girl.

18:57.960 --> 19:08.280
I got it on Dragon Rock before, and it's either that or, you know, people say, like, I would

19:08.280 --> 19:14.280
get it every so often back when I was a moderator on DDR Freak, it was either, oh my god you're

19:14.280 --> 19:16.280
a girl or oh my god you're not Asian.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.280
Yeah?

19:17.280 --> 19:20.280
Because that's that stereotype that only Asians play DDR.

19:20.280 --> 19:23.360
Oh my god you're not an Asian boy!

19:23.360 --> 19:28.300
I would I actually got it when I played tetranet you know but I would I would

19:28.300 --> 19:35.100
actually when I used to list my video game collection on places people go you

19:35.100 --> 19:40.780
can't have all that because you're a girl why where is there some type of law

19:40.780 --> 19:45.900
that says I can't be good at video games and I can't enjoy video games because I

19:45.900 --> 19:51.580
have boobs in a uterus okay where is that law I'd like to see it so that I

19:51.580 --> 19:54.160
and set it on fire.

19:54.160 --> 19:57.600
And you know, it's interesting because there was also one of those IRC logs

19:57.600 --> 19:59.920
talked about where she responded

19:59.920 --> 20:03.360
that she said something about like, oh, I really like Johnny Depp or

20:03.360 --> 20:04.960
something, and one of the people said,

20:04.960 --> 20:06.960
that's gay, what are you, gay?

20:06.960 --> 20:08.320
And I was kind of like,

20:08.320 --> 20:13.400
so what if it was a gay person? You know, obviously as a gay gamer myself,

20:13.400 --> 20:17.400
I face sometimes a lot of these same types of issues that you're

20:17.400 --> 20:19.680
bringing up as well, where people like go,

20:19.680 --> 20:22.360
oh my gosh you're actually gay and then like you know they'll shut up for a long

20:22.360 --> 20:23.320
time

20:23.320 --> 20:25.600
you know and it's kinda like it's just like

20:25.600 --> 20:28.240
or sometimes I've gotten that where it's like

20:28.240 --> 20:31.580
you're gay you shouldn't be playing video games you should be like you know being in a

20:31.580 --> 20:33.840
musical and listening to barbara stryzan

20:33.840 --> 20:35.960
ok let me be the first to tell you

20:35.960 --> 20:39.920
i fuckin hate barbara stryzan ok i hate her i hate her music i hate her movies i

20:39.920 --> 20:42.140
hate everything about barbara stryzan

20:42.140 --> 20:43.580
she's like butter

20:43.580 --> 20:47.320
no she's like shit i can't i don't i don't like her at all

20:47.320 --> 20:49.480
my mom likes her a lot but that's my mom

20:49.480 --> 20:53.100
uh... so you know it's a it's a type of stereotypes i really hate it's like so

20:53.100 --> 20:56.180
what if i'm gay i can play video games just like anybody else

20:56.180 --> 20:58.020
so what if you're a girl you know how to pick

20:58.020 --> 20:59.460
we've all got hands

20:59.460 --> 21:01.780
that's all you need to use a controller right

21:01.780 --> 21:05.580
well and apologies to any of you guys who you might have had amputation

21:05.580 --> 21:08.200
i think that this device is for you to

21:08.200 --> 21:11.100
is also that this link i've actually seen some play with the joysticks in

21:11.100 --> 21:13.100
their chin

21:13.100 --> 21:16.740
and that there's also uh... a little another thing i want to read on here

21:16.740 --> 21:21.460
You know it's just because a girl plays video games doesn't necessarily mean

21:21.460 --> 21:25.260
she's going to instantly put her picture up on the Internet for you know the male

21:25.260 --> 21:28.060
population to drool over because it's a woman that plays a game.

21:28.860 --> 21:32.380
I'm going to go ahead and quote her on this again if nobody minds.

21:33.340 --> 21:36.900
Again a girl who doesn't show her picture on the Internet is not a girl and the

21:36.900 --> 21:39.860
only girls on the Internet are actually guys who are just trying to get free

21:39.860 --> 21:40.180
stuff.

21:40.540 --> 21:42.660
Don't get me wrong I haven't gotten free stuff before.

21:42.940 --> 21:45.540
No I have gotten free stuff before but I don't solicit it.

21:45.540 --> 21:48.740
Not like those quote girls who sit around dancing for tips and games

21:49.140 --> 21:53.140
You know who you are and you know, you're not a real girl real girls don't exist on the internet

21:53.140 --> 22:00.100
Yeah, FYI guys if you think every girl that you run into in an MMO is actually a girl

22:00.460 --> 22:04.940
Just like if you assume that every guy you run into on an MMO is actually a guy

22:05.820 --> 22:08.020
You are an idiot

22:08.700 --> 22:14.660
I've played male characters before and I've played female characters before and it's not because I'm gay

22:14.660 --> 22:19.020
I had on my Ragnarok account. I played a male so that I could play a bard

22:19.020 --> 22:25.060
Yeah, how many of you guys out there? How many of you straight men out there have ever played Street Fighter 2 is Chun Li

22:25.860 --> 22:31.300
Did that make you gay? No, did it make you feel like less of a man or not? So fresh?

22:31.300 --> 22:38.540
No, it's just another character in a game the exact same thing in an MMO acceptable because she has big jugs. Oh stop

22:38.540 --> 22:42.100
shut up stop it

22:42.100 --> 22:46.300
but the whole thing just really gets me because and I have

22:46.300 --> 22:50.700
you know being a female gamer it's even worse though being a female gamer with

22:50.700 --> 22:52.240
the voice in the community though

22:52.240 --> 22:56.060
because you know I admitted I've gotten some hate mail from people who have

22:56.060 --> 22:56.980
literally told me

22:56.980 --> 23:00.040
to get off the radio and get back in the kitchen

23:00.040 --> 23:05.820
what the fuck century is this excuse me

23:05.820 --> 23:11.100
what backwards ass country did you grow up in where they still have Neanderthals

23:11.100 --> 23:14.900
in charge banging women on the head and dragging them around by their hair to

23:14.900 --> 23:19.140
make them go cook them dinner though seriously the dark soccer is a pretty

23:19.140 --> 23:24.020
good cook I will I will I am an excellent cook but then again you know

23:24.020 --> 23:28.380
that's not the point I also don't clean house I make my husband do it I have a

23:28.380 --> 23:35.020
house husband all right no for real no but the thing is is you know even even

23:35.020 --> 23:38.800
my husband's friends you know are a bit surprised that I'll go in there every so

23:38.800 --> 23:44.140
often and play games with them and you know regularly own people on like you

23:44.140 --> 23:48.460
know I am I have to say I when Tekken 3 was out I was the goddess of Tekken and

23:48.460 --> 23:53.160
I used to go in there and so humble about it it's true I used to I used to

23:53.160 --> 23:56.280
go in there and smoke all the boys and they'd be like oh my god I got beat by

23:56.280 --> 24:01.680
a girl this is also Alabama but still I remember going into cyber station one

24:01.680 --> 24:08.400
the same one I worked at and we had the brand new deluxe Tekken 3 there and these guys have

24:08.400 --> 24:12.240
been there since the store opened at 9 a.m. I show up at 2 in the afternoon they've been doing

24:12.240 --> 24:16.480
nothing but playing King all day doing the throw combos I go in there with Jhin and just knock

24:16.480 --> 24:21.480
them off the machine. Didn't somebody actually tell you once like oh my god it's the girl that

24:21.480 --> 24:26.680
plays Tekken? Yes. Like you're the girl, the only girl in the United States that's ever played Tekken.

24:26.680 --> 24:29.880
back to Alabama

24:29.880 --> 24:34.560
and ran into somebody at the arcade and I was like, yeah, I used to come in here all the

24:34.560 --> 24:38.840
time and play Tekken. Oh my god, you're that girl that plays Tekken!

24:38.840 --> 24:43.080
Like, you're the only girl in the universe that's ever played Tekken. Apparently I had been

24:43.080 --> 24:47.120
talked about for a little bit after I left. I also was the one on campus who used to beat

24:47.120 --> 24:48.080
people on a...

24:48.080 --> 24:51.120
well, because we had a Darkstalkers machine. That used to be my game. That and

24:51.120 --> 24:53.280
Killer Instinct.

24:53.280 --> 24:55.400
But, you know, it gets me that

24:55.400 --> 24:58.600
there's this whole thing that girls can't play games like that?

24:58.600 --> 25:02.080
Either that or the girls who are like the uber sluts.

25:02.080 --> 25:05.920
Well this ties into the next article that I'm gonna bring up here which I'm

25:05.920 --> 25:07.640
sure will piss you off a little bit.

25:07.640 --> 25:12.400
Here it is, it's located at www.kimrom.info is the little blog

25:12.400 --> 25:15.600
and it's the blog post from March 8th and it goes

25:15.600 --> 25:20.980
female gaming my ass. And I think I get the point that they're trying to make in

25:20.980 --> 25:23.360
this article because they talk about like you know

25:23.360 --> 25:29.800
They show these pictures, especially like a girl gaming website.

25:29.800 --> 25:33.520
Another great example of how female gaming attracts attention is a new team who calls

25:33.520 --> 25:35.280
themselves Can't Touch This.

25:35.280 --> 25:38.600
The image below is their new homepage design.

25:38.600 --> 25:43.440
It's totally an exploitation of women's site and it's pink and it shows a girl in a bikini,

25:43.440 --> 25:47.000
a little butt, and I think what's kind of amusing is that they put a response like if

25:47.000 --> 25:49.240
it was a guy's site.

25:49.240 --> 25:51.600
You would never see this about guys, exactly.

25:51.600 --> 25:54.240
That guy's ass is not attractive.

25:54.240 --> 25:59.780
And then they also show this here, there is an interview there with Vildkaten, a Danish

25:59.780 --> 26:06.180
female gamer, and along with the article is a shot of her not wearing a bra, holding a

26:06.180 --> 26:13.160
gun with her legs wide open, and it is a little bit sensationalism and I can totally see where

26:13.160 --> 26:14.500
this would piss someone off.

26:14.500 --> 26:15.500
This is stupid.

26:15.500 --> 26:16.500
It's right.

26:16.500 --> 26:20.980
The sensationalism of girls playing video games just because they are girls and showing

26:20.980 --> 26:25.300
off the tits and everything and like OMG this is what a girl playing a game looks like and

26:25.300 --> 26:30.020
when you run into a girl team they're all gonna be babes and stuff no that's just that's

26:30.020 --> 26:34.020
that's stupid and I agree with that portion of the article how the hell are you gonna

26:34.020 --> 26:40.260
operate the mouse if you're holding a gun that doesn't work here's the problem the article

26:40.260 --> 26:44.700
was written like I and this is my opinion here guys but I think the article was written

26:44.700 --> 26:49.340
so trashy and so sensationalistic let me let me give you a way that this art the article

26:49.340 --> 26:51.340
opens up here.

26:51.340 --> 26:53.580
Men are better at computer games than women.

26:53.580 --> 26:54.580
Big surprise.

26:54.580 --> 26:58.300
We grow up playing games, we spend enormous amounts of time playing games, we consciously

26:58.300 --> 27:01.720
dedicate time to better ourselves, and we are competitive by nature.

27:01.720 --> 27:03.660
No wonder we're better gamers.

27:03.660 --> 27:10.360
And I'm thinking like, okay, you've never seen a woman who's obsessed with soccer play

27:10.360 --> 27:13.320
in soccer because those bitches are some of the most competitive women I've ever seen

27:13.320 --> 27:14.320
in my life.

27:14.320 --> 27:15.320
I mean, seriously.

27:15.320 --> 27:18.800
I mean, just these broad generalizations

27:18.800 --> 27:20.200
that the person's making here to open.

27:20.200 --> 27:21.320
I don't know if they're doing this

27:21.320 --> 27:23.140
for shock value or something,

27:23.140 --> 27:26.160
but it just totally, like, when I read it

27:26.160 --> 27:27.920
and it opened up with that, it totally,

27:27.920 --> 27:29.640
like I was like, okay, I don't even,

27:29.640 --> 27:31.640
even if there's a point in here somewhere,

27:31.640 --> 27:33.480
it's lost on me.

27:33.480 --> 27:35.040
Dark Soccer, I'm sure you felt similarly.

27:35.040 --> 27:36.920
I did actually reply to this guy.

27:36.920 --> 27:37.760
No.

27:37.760 --> 27:39.660
An itemized, he actually replied to me too,

27:39.660 --> 27:41.680
but he was just staying more of the same.

27:41.680 --> 27:44.320
I listed an itemized bit,

27:44.320 --> 27:47.960
And actually, what I first started off saying is, I wasn't going to dignify this poor excuse

27:47.960 --> 27:51.560
for an editorial with a response, but perhaps I have a small responsibility to do so.

27:51.560 --> 27:53.480
Nor were we going to talk about it on the show.

27:53.480 --> 27:54.480
Oops.

27:54.480 --> 28:00.560
But, you know, I think that this guy's idiocy should be pointed out, because this is an

28:00.560 --> 28:02.480
attitude that's prevalent, though.

28:02.480 --> 28:12.080
I understand wanting to see less of the, quote, hoochie gamers, you know, but it's like I

28:12.080 --> 28:15.920
pointed out he's basically going from his male ego, that's all he was speaking from.

28:15.920 --> 28:19.360
Here's another quote, but the real problem with female gaming is that female gamers in

28:19.360 --> 28:24.480
general have the same ambitions as men, but they lack the dedication and drive to fulfill

28:24.480 --> 28:32.200
those ambitions.

28:32.200 --> 28:36.880
Let that quote speak for itself there, I mean it's just like, you know, I know plenty of

28:36.880 --> 28:41.000
women who are very high level, in fact there was just an article that was floating the

28:41.000 --> 28:46.240
internet this week about one of the girls who was on season 7 of Buffy, one of the other

28:46.240 --> 28:50.480
slayers, is secretly a level 60 character in World of Warcraft.

28:50.480 --> 28:54.960
So I'm like, you know what, girls can have that ambition and drive to succeed in a game

28:54.960 --> 29:00.920
just like any guy, but you can't ever say, all girls, and you can't ever say all men

29:00.920 --> 29:01.920
because you're going to be wrong.

29:01.920 --> 29:07.040
One of my co-workers regularly talks to the guy in the cubicle across from me about her

29:07.040 --> 29:14.040
level what close to 70 character on World of Warcraft and she's been wanting me to pay

29:14.180 --> 29:21.180
for my account again. I have a friend who's like the C-mode goddess in Phantasy Star Online.

29:22.140 --> 29:29.140
She just goes in there and smokes people. Why is it? Why do guys think this? I'm not

29:31.740 --> 29:36.180
saying that all guys think this, but it does seem to be a pretty prevalent misconception

29:36.180 --> 29:41.340
among male gamers.

29:41.340 --> 29:45.380
I don't want to turn around the whole sexist thing myself, but I also think that a whole

29:45.380 --> 29:51.380
big chunk of it is male ego being threatened by women being able to do something.

29:51.380 --> 29:54.540
As some of it is, I would agree.

29:54.540 --> 29:58.620
As a guy, I would agree, but granted, my perspective on the thing is different.

29:58.620 --> 30:03.660
But it sounds to me, and I understand this guy's underlying point is that maybe he's

30:03.660 --> 30:12.620
a little pissed off because these women get these big game scholarship deals or whatever,

30:12.620 --> 30:17.940
the sponsorship deals because they have tits and ass and sell themselves as women.

30:17.940 --> 30:23.060
It's just like when Paris Hilton was carrying around the PSP as like a status thing.

30:23.060 --> 30:24.060
And I can understand.

30:24.060 --> 30:27.020
Yeah, that ticks me off too, and I'm sure it ticks you off as well.

30:27.020 --> 30:31.100
I don't want her representative of my fellow female gamers.

30:31.100 --> 30:33.340
Paris Hilton didn't even know what the box was.

30:33.340 --> 30:36.220
She's like, ooh, stuff.

30:36.220 --> 30:38.060
I'm going to go lay on this.

30:38.060 --> 30:40.100
Anyway, form your own opinions.

30:40.100 --> 30:43.320
I wanted to bring it up because, like it or not, it is an article that's been circulating

30:43.320 --> 30:44.940
a lot of the big news sites this week.

30:44.940 --> 30:50.180
So check it out if you want, camerarom.info and blog from March 8th.

30:50.180 --> 30:53.940
And I'm sure some of you guys want to respond to that, so we are going to open up our Skype

30:53.940 --> 30:55.040
line at this time.

30:55.040 --> 30:59.520
If you guys want to give us a call, you can give us a call on our Skype line.

30:59.520 --> 31:07.280
Just go to interact with us on www.orangeloungeradio.com or you can actually give us a telephone call

31:07.280 --> 31:08.740
as well.

31:08.740 --> 31:19.640
The telephone number is 916-226-9067, but remember that could be a toll call, so please

31:19.640 --> 31:24.380
ask the permission of whoever runs the line before you actually give us a call because

31:24.380 --> 31:26.300
there might be charges incurred.

31:26.300 --> 31:27.300
Let's go to the phones.

31:27.300 --> 31:28.380
Wow, they're lighting up tonight.

31:28.380 --> 31:29.820
Let's start off with you.

31:29.820 --> 31:31.700
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

31:31.700 --> 31:32.700
Hi.

31:32.700 --> 31:33.700
Hello.

31:33.700 --> 31:34.700
Hi.

31:34.700 --> 31:36.700
Hi, who's this?

31:36.700 --> 31:40.860
Raven's Dolphin. Hello Raven's Dolphin, what's on your mind?

31:40.860 --> 31:43.820
Hello. Well, I am a PSP gamer.

31:43.820 --> 31:47.060
Uh-huh. And I see that you like,

31:47.060 --> 31:51.380
you're just dissing it all night. Is there a particular part of the argument that

31:51.380 --> 31:52.780
you don't like that I'm dissing on?

31:52.780 --> 31:57.460
Well, there's lots of games that come out for it. There are a lot of games that come out

31:57.460 --> 32:00.460
for the PSP, I'll give you that, but I'm gonna be honest, there just hasn't been a

32:00.460 --> 32:03.900
whole lot that's really been that exciting to me, but that's not to say

32:03.900 --> 32:05.860
that there isn't stuff coming up

32:05.860 --> 32:09.900
that's exciting to me, such as, well, the Mega Man games were just released, and I still

32:09.900 --> 32:12.100
need to check those out, but of course, me and my Katamari,

32:12.100 --> 32:16.580
Luminous, I named as my game of the year last year, was a PSP game.

32:16.580 --> 32:20.700
So, you know, there are things to like about the PSP. I just think that

32:20.700 --> 32:26.300
you can't, it's not existing just to be a game system.

32:26.300 --> 32:29.580
They're also trying to do a lot of other stuff with it, like, such as, you know, the

32:29.580 --> 32:31.180
built-in web stuff, and the

32:31.180 --> 32:37.940
Podcast downloads and the flash being incorporated into it and the i-toy and all that other stuff as well. Oh, okay

32:38.740 --> 32:41.680
So was there anything else it was there anything else you want to say about that?

32:42.340 --> 32:46.000
Yeah, I do. I bought Mega Man the two of them

32:47.060 --> 32:51.480
Uh-huh. What'd you think about that? There's a little bit of lag. So just feel free to speak freely give your thoughts on that

32:51.480 --> 32:56.700
I love them both. I thought powered up with the best. Well, I'm definitely gonna have to check it out

32:57.040 --> 33:00.500
Yeah, you can download maps from it from their own servers

33:00.500 --> 33:04.380
Well that's kind of cool and that's something you know that the DS doesn't do is like the

33:04.380 --> 33:09.580
whole like I mean it's just now starting to get into the online interactivity thing so

33:09.580 --> 33:12.660
you know Nintendo still has a long way to grow in that department but of course you

33:12.660 --> 33:16.020
know when Metroid Prime Hunters is deciding but I like you know I like that idea of all

33:16.020 --> 33:19.820
the expansions and all that stuff but anyway Ravenstaufen thank you so much for the call

33:19.820 --> 33:22.240

This is like Nintendo and Xbox, just like everything else.

36:45.080 --> 36:48.080
Like, if it's not Sony, this is it.

36:48.080 --> 36:49.080
Why?

Well, uh, punch him in the face.

36:56.080 --> 36:58.080
I don't know what else to tell you.

36:58.080 --> 37:00.080
He actually punched him in the face once.

37:00.080 --> 37:04.080
Has he ever actually played Microsoft or Nintendo products?

37:04.080 --> 37:08.080
Uh, he played Pictochat on my DS?

37:08.080 --> 37:11.440

Hello?

37:49.160 --> 37:51.160
Hi, Funny Dale, what's on your mind?

37:51.160 --> 37:56.580
I was going to talk about the issue you had a few minutes ago about the female gamers.

37:56.580 --> 37:58.560
By all means, go for it.

37:58.560 --> 38:03.600
And the reason why you see these websites, the FragDolls and the PMS Clan all have these

38:03.600 --> 38:10.600
like young supermodels is because, well, I hate to say this, but a lot, a good portion

38:10.600 --> 38:16.320
of the video game audience is a bunch of 15 year olds who, well, can't get laid, so, and

38:16.320 --> 38:20.400
they shouldn't really be looking at porn, so the FragDolls are probably the closest

38:20.400 --> 38:21.400
thing.

38:21.400 --> 38:25.860
I, you know what, and I agree with that, I totally agree with what you're saying, FunnyDale,

38:25.860 --> 38:31.120
Because it's apparent in what's happening with G4TV as well, right?

38:31.120 --> 38:34.000
Because it was supposed to be like a network for games and it kind of turned into, it's

38:34.000 --> 38:37.960
just geared at the young 15 year old males and stuff who can't get laid, right?

38:37.960 --> 38:38.960
It's the same thing.

38:38.960 --> 38:44.340
But here's the problem I see with that, is that if gaming truly wants to open its audience

38:44.340 --> 38:49.340
to everyone, as you see that Nintendo is trying to do very badly, and granted Nintendo doesn't

38:49.340 --> 38:53.380
sponsor any of this stuff, but I'm talking about the gamer community as a whole, if you

38:53.380 --> 38:58.260
You want to be looked at as something other than a bunch of 15-year-old kids who can't

38:58.260 --> 38:59.680
get laid.

38:59.680 --> 39:02.300
This shit has to stop.

39:02.300 --> 39:06.000
And that's what it's really about, and I think that's why we're here kind of speaking out

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
against it a little bit.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.100
It's here to say, you know what?

39:09.100 --> 39:14.800
Gamers come in all shapes, sizes, and types, and we like games, and we don't have to fit

39:14.800 --> 39:16.260
into these certain stereotypes.

39:16.260 --> 39:23.100
And it's just another sign of how stereotypes hurt society, and that goes in all facets

39:23.100 --> 39:29.820
Why can't we go back to the wonderful, you know, flashback for me like 20 years ago.

39:29.820 --> 39:31.900
Or maybe not even quite 20 years ago.

39:31.900 --> 39:35.940
Let's go back to the time when gaming was real gaming.

39:35.940 --> 39:38.540
We're talking the Nintendo World Championships.

39:38.540 --> 39:39.540
God damn it.

39:39.540 --> 39:43.780
Why can't we go back to simpler times where it was based on skill and not whether you're

39:43.780 --> 39:45.180
a man or woman.

39:45.180 --> 39:49.500
It's how well you're good at Super Mario Brothers, Rad Racer, and Tetris when the Power Glove

39:49.500 --> 39:50.500
was so bad.

39:50.500 --> 39:52.940
Yes, Collar, you were trying to get a point in there.

39:52.940 --> 39:59.460
The problem with the argument is that game publishers are there to make money, and they

39:59.460 --> 40:00.620
make money doing that.

40:00.620 --> 40:02.700
Just look at MTV.

40:02.700 --> 40:08.580
That's a good point, but also look at games like Tetris and Brain Training and the PopCap

40:08.580 --> 40:12.300
games is another big one on the internet, popcap.com.

40:12.300 --> 40:17.000
Those games and those types of things really reach to such a broader audience.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.980
I think the publishers have to be willing to take a risk once in a while.

40:19.980 --> 40:24.340
I think Tetris is the exception, not the rule.

40:24.340 --> 40:28.480
It is, but I mean, you know, games like that, well I'm just saying, you know, games in general,

40:28.480 --> 40:32.480
you know, it could be the rule that games, and I'm not saying that there can't be those

40:32.480 --> 40:37.320
types of games, but I wish there would be more than that.

40:37.320 --> 40:40.960
You know, we should have more of everything, you know what I mean?

40:40.960 --> 40:42.800
A broader selection.

40:42.800 --> 40:47.720
Well, as long as it makes them money, they'll keep on doing it, and that's unfortunate,

40:47.720 --> 40:48.720
but it's true.

40:48.720 --> 40:51.900
But again, that's why I vote with my dollars.

40:51.900 --> 40:54.160
It's a point that came up in part A,

40:54.160 --> 40:55.000
vote with my dollars.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.800
I'm not gonna continue to support these games

40:56.800 --> 41:01.160
that are all about the TNA.

41:01.160 --> 41:02.520
Well, maybe Dead or Alive, though,

41:02.520 --> 41:04.300
because that game's kind of fun.

41:04.300 --> 41:05.840
When it's like total exploitation,

41:05.840 --> 41:06.680
then it's kind of funny.

41:06.680 --> 41:07.840
D.O.A. volleyball is fun.

41:07.840 --> 41:10.640
I'm sorry, I even think that D.O.A. volleyball

41:10.640 --> 41:11.600
was just hilarious.

41:11.600 --> 41:13.740
All right, well, thank you, Funny Dale, for your call.

41:13.740 --> 41:15.120
You seem pretty well informed.

41:15.120 --> 41:16.880
I have some good points there, okay?

41:16.880 --> 41:18.040
It's no problem, thanks.

41:18.040 --> 41:19.040
Have a good one, buddy!

41:19.040 --> 41:22.360
All right, thank you guys very much for the calls tonight on our Skype line.

41:22.360 --> 41:25.360
We'll try to open that up again a little later if we have time, but we've got to keep moving

41:25.360 --> 41:26.920
on for right now.

41:26.920 --> 41:29.920
And we're going to move on to a story that I thought this was fascinating.

41:29.920 --> 41:35.800
Loki, this is about what happens to prisoners.

41:35.800 --> 41:37.800
Spoiled rotten prisoners.

41:37.800 --> 41:42.400
Now, seriously, it's really interesting.

41:42.400 --> 41:46.200
Now when you go to prison, you actually might be able to play video games.

41:46.200 --> 41:47.200
That's right.

41:47.200 --> 41:52.720
Inmates in Oregon can purchase a plug-and-play console, kind of like a kiosk to Nintendo,

41:52.720 --> 41:58.840
with 50 embedded games and are mounted to an LCD TV if they behave.

41:58.840 --> 42:06.040
Plus, I don't know, it's just really interesting that they're actually coming out with video

42:06.040 --> 42:07.400
games from inmates.

42:07.400 --> 42:14.200
I mean, come on, they're in there for... unless they're playing really crappy games, like

42:14.200 --> 42:17.960
you know, E.T. or something like that for the 2600.

42:17.960 --> 42:21.700
What I thought was funniest about that kind of, that article was that

42:21.700 --> 42:26.520
like some stupid prison had allowed games like Grand Theft Auto and games

42:26.520 --> 42:29.680
where you're killing cops to actually be played until they realized what was

42:29.680 --> 42:33.960
actually in the game. Oh my god! I didn't realize there was cop killing and cop killer the

42:33.960 --> 42:36.320
game. Your tax dollars at work.

42:36.320 --> 42:41.360
But is this a good thing, a bad thing?

42:41.360 --> 42:45.480
I don't know. I think it's a stupid thing. I mean, as it is, it costs us

42:45.480 --> 42:49.200
a ton of money to keep prisoners in prison anyways. Why are we giving them the

42:49.200 --> 42:53.080
luxuries of all this stuff? In fact, why the hell are we even heating their cells or

42:53.080 --> 42:57.360
anything? I mean, it should be kept like Alcatraz.

42:57.360 --> 43:02.440
What happened to the days when prisons were places where people went to be punished?

43:02.440 --> 43:09.520
The thing is that I hear that this comes out to sort of

43:09.520 --> 43:13.400
combat like prison riots. It's to try and de-stress the prisoners

43:13.400 --> 43:17.000
but I'm kinda like you know what? You gotta figure out a different way to

43:17.000 --> 43:17.840
break up prison riots.

43:17.840 --> 43:22.200
They riot! We shoot them with a shotgun to the face! I mean, come on! It's pretty simple!

43:22.200 --> 43:25.240
Now we're getting into pretty radical politics but yeah you gotta think of other

43:25.240 --> 43:26.000
ways to combat

43:26.000 --> 43:29.840
prison riots, you know? They're gonna riot if they don't have a face!

43:29.840 --> 43:33.560
Don't let them out of their cell if they're gonna riot.

43:33.560 --> 43:36.880
I like the running man because Richard Dawson was a villain

43:36.880 --> 43:40.160
And that's awesome.

43:40.160 --> 43:43.840
One thing that's certainly villainous in its own way is spam on the internet.

43:43.840 --> 43:45.800
You know you guys hate getting spam mail.

43:45.800 --> 43:46.800
Well guess what?

43:46.800 --> 43:52.520
Now you can get spam on your Xbox 360 thanks to Burnout Revenge who encourages you to send

43:52.520 --> 43:57.840
in-game clips to your friends and you even get achievement points when you do so, right

43:57.840 --> 44:00.600
Loki who spammed me last week with this?

44:00.600 --> 44:01.600
Sorry.

44:01.600 --> 44:02.600
It's alright.

44:02.600 --> 44:03.600
You didn't know.

44:03.600 --> 44:05.720
But this is the thing is that now everybody's getting spammed with these messages because

44:05.720 --> 44:07.720
Is it so easy to send your clips to everyone?

44:07.720 --> 44:08.720
Well here's the reason why.

44:08.720 --> 44:12.040
One of the achievements, and it's actually 60 points, which is pretty big, is to make

44:12.040 --> 44:16.120
it to the top 20 clips on Burnout.

44:16.120 --> 44:19.520
The problem is though, in order to make it up there, the top clip has like a thousand

44:19.520 --> 44:20.760
views on it right now.

44:20.760 --> 44:25.380
So you have to send it to a lot of friends to get that to happen.

44:25.380 --> 44:28.560
So yeah, I think you guys need to be a little smarter when you're thinking of your achievement

44:28.560 --> 44:29.960
points scales like that.

44:29.960 --> 44:33.040
That's not an achievement in gameplay.

44:33.040 --> 44:34.040
That's an achievement in whoring.

44:34.040 --> 44:37.120
And to be honest, the replays are kind of retarded anyways.

44:37.120 --> 44:41.520
I mean, I've made some pretty cool ones, but nothing like, oh my god, you have to see this,

44:41.520 --> 44:44.960
except for the glitch that I saw, but I couldn't record that.

44:44.960 --> 44:46.320
Alright.

44:46.320 --> 44:50.480
Anyway, you got some hackin' and crackin' news, right, Loki?

44:50.480 --> 44:51.680
Of course.

44:51.680 --> 44:57.760
The first one, it's pretty major actually, was that the Xbox 360 DVD firmware has been

44:57.760 --> 45:03.680
hacked, and there's a video of it, and basically the way it works is all Xbox 360 games that

45:03.680 --> 45:10.880
come out there. Of course, they're all encoded so that you can't reverse engineer them and

45:10.880 --> 45:21.120
stuff. So that's something. Plus, each single file type,.xex, has a media flag. Basically,

45:21.120 --> 45:27.360
the media flag tells the Xbox what type of media it's on. Whether that be a CDR, DVD-R,

45:27.360 --> 45:35.360
DVD Plus R, etc, etc, or DVD, Xbox, DVD, Xbox 360, so it knows what type of media it's on.

45:35.360 --> 45:41.200
So, for example, I try to copy a game and I make a perfect copy, and it's on a DVD-R,

45:41.200 --> 45:46.100
it's going to say, hey, this isn't a press CD, I'm not playing.

45:46.100 --> 45:51.020
So what they did was they actually modified the DVD firmware not to make that check.

45:51.020 --> 45:55.240
So if I make an exact copy of the game, it will run like nothing.

45:55.240 --> 45:58.380
Of course as with all these exploits

45:58.380 --> 46:01.880
the hacking group behind it is not releasing the firmware because

46:01.880 --> 46:05.380
they don't endorse piracy they only endorse hacking

46:05.380 --> 46:11.020
so okay so yeah it's not gonna be released but um

46:11.020 --> 46:15.780
it can be done. Well somebody else will have to figure it out I suppose who doesn't endorse

46:15.780 --> 46:17.440
piracy if that's what you're into

46:17.440 --> 46:20.920
exactly and here's my thing because I remember back in the heyday

46:20.920 --> 46:24.080
when I used to like import games I used to get HK copies

46:24.080 --> 46:27.600
basically these were mass-produced pirated copies where they would be

46:27.600 --> 46:28.360
pressed

46:28.360 --> 46:31.920
why aren't these floating around out there

46:31.920 --> 46:35.600
and I mean because if you can press an exact copy of the game

46:35.600 --> 46:39.960
and it's on a DVD I mean shouldn't it work?

46:39.960 --> 46:43.320
maybe? I don't know. Just a thought.

46:43.320 --> 46:47.880
but anyways and of course some other cool stuff

46:47.880 --> 46:50.960
of course on the PSP the first one is this

46:50.960 --> 46:57.520
really strange stick minigame, it's like with stick figures, called Pointless Tormenting.

46:57.520 --> 47:06.520
And it's basically, you torment stick figures. It's just really simple, it's kind of stupid,

47:06.520 --> 47:10.560
if you're interested in it. Remember Stick Fighter? Stick Fighter was kind of fun. That's

47:10.560 --> 47:16.200
all I wanted to say. It's on, you know, PSP updates, so you can check that out. Pretty

47:16.200 --> 47:21.200
sweet. Another kind of cool game is another homebrew game that's been I think even on

47:21.200 --> 47:28.280
the Dreamcast called Dragon Fighter. It's kind of like a Final Fantasy fighting game

47:28.280 --> 47:34.040
almost. It has the really super deformed characters and stuff. Dragon Fighter version 0.2 was

47:34.040 --> 47:38.200
released on the PSP so you can check it out. I think actually some of the graphics were

47:38.200 --> 47:43.140
used from RPG Maker is where they based a lot of the songs. Check it out, it might be

47:43.140 --> 47:47.760
something interesting. It's free. It's on PSP updates as well. Another one that I did

47:47.760 --> 47:54.760
find that was kind of neat was this game called Erquon Masters. Now if you remember way back

47:56.000 --> 48:00.080
in the day in DOS games there was this game called Star Control which was pretty sweet.

48:00.080 --> 48:07.080
It was like a kind of a space shooter RPG type of thing. Well this is based on that

48:07.840 --> 48:12.320
and it's also based on another knock off game called of course Erquon Masters. But check

48:12.320 --> 48:17.800
Check it out, they have version 0.50 available and it looks pretty sweet.

48:17.800 --> 48:23.480
If it's anything like Star Control or Star Control 2 was, really fun shooter game so

48:23.480 --> 48:24.480
check it out.

48:24.480 --> 48:30.260
Alright, we're now going to go ahead and let Dark Sakura dive in and open up our mailbag

48:30.260 --> 48:33.840
when you guys send us letters to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

48:33.840 --> 48:38.560
Dark Sakura likes to dig through the mailbag and pick out a few favorites to make fun of

48:38.560 --> 48:39.840
here live on air.

48:39.840 --> 48:40.840
I'm good at that.

48:40.840 --> 48:41.840
No, just kidding.

48:41.840 --> 48:46.040
We'll give some serious responses with our help here to this week's letters.

48:46.040 --> 48:47.280
So let's open up the mail bag.

48:47.280 --> 48:49.420
Who sent us the mail this week?

48:49.420 --> 48:57.520
Siphaan wrote in and said, I've got another suggestion for the show.

48:57.520 --> 49:01.400
How about making a question for the listener call-in section?

49:01.400 --> 49:05.040
As it seems to me now, the call-in part is really people just doing a shout-out or whatever.

49:05.040 --> 49:07.520
There doesn't seem to be any real structure.

49:07.520 --> 49:10.560
If you were to pose a question early in the show, listeners would have time to think about

49:10.560 --> 49:14.760
answers and could call in and discuss. I think it's okay to have random calls and

49:14.760 --> 49:17.400
shout outs but it's not very interesting unless you have something to say. What do you think?

49:17.400 --> 49:23.520
I think that's a good idea but I think I see a lot of other

49:23.520 --> 49:27.640
podcasts that kind of do that and although I don't see a whole lot that

49:27.640 --> 49:31.280
are interactive in that way a lot of them do it through email and things

49:31.280 --> 49:35.400
like that and I kind of always like at least my envision of the show is that

49:35.400 --> 49:39.040
things be like an open format and if somebody had a topic they wanted to

49:39.040 --> 49:41.360
bring to us, they could do that on the Skype line.

49:41.360 --> 49:43.320
So I'm not discounting your idea, it's a good one,

49:43.320 --> 49:46.560
but I just, you know, I wanna keep that openness,

49:46.560 --> 49:48.880
and I think Darkstalker and Loki agree here.

49:48.880 --> 49:50.960
But certainly, you know what, I have an idea

49:50.960 --> 49:53.160
that's very similar to what you're saying,

49:53.160 --> 49:55.520
that you might see come up on a future show,

49:55.520 --> 49:57.720
we just have to make sure the technology's in place.

49:57.720 --> 50:00.040
However, that doesn't mean we might start getting

50:00.040 --> 50:01.640
a little stricter with the Skype calls,

50:01.640 --> 50:03.200
because I am getting a lot of feedback

50:03.200 --> 50:05.140
from podcast listeners that some of the Skype calls

50:05.140 --> 50:07.480
are kind of boring, so we may start having to cut

50:07.480 --> 50:10.520
some of them from the show, like when people just call in to say hi and don't really have

50:10.520 --> 50:13.360
anything to say, fortunately we're probably going to have to cut those from the future

50:13.360 --> 50:14.600
podcast production.

50:14.600 --> 50:17.820
So just kind of a word of warning though as you guys call into Skype, don't get us wrong,

50:17.820 --> 50:20.960
we love to hear from you, but please have something to say.

50:20.960 --> 50:27.880
And also please, that's gaming related, call Echo 1-2-3 so we don't hear this, yes, hi!

50:27.880 --> 50:28.880
Yes.

50:28.880 --> 50:29.880
Or when we hear ourselves say hi.

50:29.880 --> 50:30.880
Hello!

50:30.880 --> 50:33.320
Yeah, so you are going to see that starting in future weeks.

50:33.320 --> 50:36.880
So you know, this is all kind of new to us, there aren't a lot of shows that do the interactive

50:36.880 --> 50:40.320
so we're still kinda learning along with you but I think it's a good idea and I

50:40.320 --> 50:43.200
think you'll see that we're gonna roll out something similar to that in the

50:43.200 --> 50:43.880
future

50:43.880 --> 50:47.480
so if you don't call Echo 123 before calling us we will send a Ninja

50:47.480 --> 50:50.420
Death Squad after you. That's right.

50:50.420 --> 50:53.460
We keep one in the closet

50:53.460 --> 50:57.240
and a little storage shed outside. That's right. Also another question

50:57.240 --> 51:00.260
he asks is WTF

51:00.260 --> 51:04.560
have they done to Mega Man? Have you seen the screenshots from Mega Man powered up?

51:04.560 --> 51:07.720
WTF, WTF, WTF.

51:07.720 --> 51:08.960
Um, no I haven't.

51:08.960 --> 51:11.360
Actually I haven't either. It's really super deformed.

51:11.360 --> 51:14.080
He has a huge, ginormous head.

51:14.080 --> 51:17.580
But it's a cool game! It really is a cool game. So,

51:17.580 --> 51:20.200
you know what? It's a different art style. It's just like people go,

51:20.200 --> 51:21.880
What the hell happened to Link?

51:21.880 --> 51:25.120
He looks all cel-shaded and funky looking.

51:25.120 --> 51:27.600
It's still a good game.

51:27.600 --> 51:32.520
Except for the fact that the world was flooded and then when you go

51:32.520 --> 51:38.640
to one spoiler part of this, you know, game when you see Hyrule's underwater, um, you're

51:38.640 --> 51:42.600
like, why couldn't it have been that game, you know, where Hyrule's not underwater, but

51:42.600 --> 51:50.600
whatever. Oh well. And more emails? Uh, actually yes, there is an email from Lauren. It says,

51:50.600 --> 51:55.720
hey, I'm looking at full metal DDR pads on eBay, it looks like you can buy one for between

51:55.720 --> 51:59.160
$100 to $500 plus, but I was wondering if you knew which manufacturers are the more

51:59.160 --> 52:05.560
dependable blade ion etc one of these ones is I think it's the one that they

52:05.560 --> 52:10.920
were selling it fries oh I've seen that pad before there oh it was broken here's

52:10.920 --> 52:13.280
the thing here's that there's there's the problem with it right there you see

52:13.280 --> 52:17.160
how it says what is this one we're looking at here the eBay one who makes

52:17.160 --> 52:20.480
this one that's I can't find the manufacturer oh this way I've bought a

52:20.480 --> 52:25.560
me a metal you a pad okay the ones that are like you know like an inch thick or

52:25.560 --> 52:31.880
something and that sucker bent here here's the one that I was at e3 my

52:31.880 --> 52:36.200
iguana girl got injured on yeah and the problem with that the one that you're

52:36.200 --> 52:39.600
looking at there on eBay it says wireless you don't want a wireless

52:39.600 --> 52:43.280
controller with a music game because there's too much of a risk even for the

52:43.280 --> 52:47.680
slightest amount of lag will screw up your music game so don't don't get that

52:47.680 --> 52:51.520
honestly guys you want a reliable metal pad to go to the people have been doing

52:51.520 --> 52:54.960
it forever red octane you know we've given them a hard time in the past about

52:54.960 --> 52:58.800
in the groove and stuff but you know guitar hero is pretty rockin and they do

52:58.800 --> 53:03.400
make some solid controllers honestly the afterburner is is the place to be for

53:03.400 --> 53:09.000
that their stuff has always been high quality yeah except for one particular

53:09.000 --> 53:13.160
game in my opinion but other people feel differently so that's just my opinion or

53:13.160 --> 53:21.960
build your own we also have the last two emails are from our friend Rob rockin to

53:21.960 --> 53:27.240
read this a friend asked me to advise on streaming HDTV to his TV from his PC so

53:27.240 --> 53:32.460
I looked it up if you go to Windows MCE the Windows MCE route there are

53:32.460 --> 53:37.020
two Microsoft devices they recommend the Xbox 360 and Windows Media Extender on

53:37.020 --> 53:42.580
the Microsoft page for MCE Windows Media Extender is downplayed almost completely

53:42.580 --> 53:48.480
in favor of the Xbox 360 they really want to push those boxes okay interesting

53:48.480 --> 53:56.520
point. And then the other thing is actually a link from, I guess, GamaSutra. There is

53:56.520 --> 54:03.360
an article here about ESA files to retrieve Illinois bill game legal costs.

54:03.360 --> 54:07.480
Ah, yes, the legal, you know, I've got to admit I've been trying to stay on what's going

54:07.480 --> 54:12.380
on with the bills and the gaming through game politics because I have them friended on my

54:12.380 --> 54:17.240
live journal, but there's just so much going on in so many different places, it's hard

54:17.240 --> 54:20.080
to keep track of to bring you guys on the show but I thought I did think this

54:20.080 --> 54:22.920
was interesting I saw a little bit about this so good

54:22.920 --> 54:26.240
well just to read the first paragraph in this article in a recently bold new move

54:26.240 --> 54:30.080
the game industry trade association with the entertainment software Association

54:30.080 --> 54:34.080
has filed a petition to the United States District Court asking it to order

54:34.080 --> 54:37.320
the state of Illinois to pay six hundred forty four thousand five hundred and

54:37.320 --> 54:41.320
forty five in legal fee that's our dollars in legal fees for its

54:41.320 --> 54:45.800
unsuccessful efforts to enact a law banning the sale of violent video games

54:45.800 --> 54:48.000
in the state.

54:48.000 --> 54:52.940
Trying to collect some of that money back that was lost on these bills that are way

54:52.940 --> 54:55.040
too radical for their own good.

54:55.040 --> 54:57.640
I think this is a very important point just to quote.

54:57.640 --> 55:02.400
The judge was Matthew S. Kennelly when he declared the law unconstitutional.

55:02.400 --> 55:06.420
His comment was, if controlling access to allegedly dangerous speech is important in

55:06.420 --> 55:10.920
promoting the positive psychological development of children, in our society that role is properly

55:10.920 --> 55:16.640
accorded to parents and families, not the state.

55:16.640 --> 55:23.960
If you've got some e-mails you want to send along, mailbag at orangelauntrader.com is

55:23.960 --> 55:26.720
a place to do it.

55:26.720 --> 55:30.000
Let's move on to some more news and of course you know I couldn't get through the show without

55:30.000 --> 55:33.240
bringing up something related to Final Fantasy XI.

55:33.240 --> 55:39.480
There's new information coming out about Treasures of Otte, Oregon thanks to the event that happened

55:39.480 --> 55:43.680
recently there, what was that in, I want to say Santa Cruz, I know it was somewhere in

55:43.680 --> 55:47.280
California they had this big event, a live event, and they showed the new trailer and

55:47.280 --> 55:50.160
everybody was cheering, well there's some new information on what's coming with the

55:50.160 --> 55:53.360
game and this sounds like it's going to be a much more thorough expansion than Chains

55:53.360 --> 55:54.360
of Promothea was.

55:54.360 --> 55:59.480
Chains of Promothea was like new missions, new areas, woo, but this is a whole lot of

55:59.480 --> 56:00.480
new stuff.

56:00.480 --> 56:05.140
Besieged mode, this is where the enemies are going to start taking over the towns and you

56:05.140 --> 56:08.560
actually fight to keep over the town, I think that's kind of neat.

56:08.560 --> 56:11.020
There's also going to be an assault mode.

56:11.020 --> 56:15.940
This is where if you're over level 50, you can just play for an hour or so, and you don't

56:15.940 --> 56:19.640
have to assemble a giant party, you just go to take a huge quest.

56:19.640 --> 56:24.960
This is a direct response to, it takes me too long to find a flippin' party, I want

56:24.960 --> 56:28.740
to do something casually that doesn't take me all night long, so I think that's a good

56:28.740 --> 56:33.580
idea except for the fact that it's limited to over level 50, because that kind of defeats

56:33.580 --> 56:36.980
the purpose in many ways, because it takes a while to get to level 50, but okay, we'll

56:36.980 --> 56:40.860
We're not even going to talk breaking the 50 cap and how hard that is.

56:40.860 --> 56:46.740
We'll wait and see how that turns out before we make our final decisions on that.

56:46.740 --> 56:50.960
Also we do know that there's going to be a brand new job class, the Puppet Master is

56:50.960 --> 56:54.740
going to be a new job class along with the previously announced Corsair, who you might

56:54.740 --> 56:57.900
as well call a pirate, and Blue Mage that were previously announced.

56:57.900 --> 56:59.620
Wasn't that a movie?

56:59.620 --> 57:00.620
Puppet Master?

57:00.620 --> 57:01.620
I think so.

57:01.620 --> 57:04.060
I don't remember if it was Puppeteer or Puppet Master.

57:04.060 --> 57:05.060
Is it Puppet Master?

57:05.060 --> 57:09.100
That just now has me thinking of a person with little creepy puppets going around.

57:09.100 --> 57:10.100
That's actually what it is.

57:10.100 --> 57:11.100
That's what it is.

57:11.100 --> 57:12.100
That's cool!

57:12.100 --> 57:13.100
Oh my!

57:13.100 --> 57:14.100
Whoa!

57:14.100 --> 57:16.440
We've got dark soccer to say something complimentary about Final Fantasy XI.

57:16.440 --> 57:17.440
Someone note the date and time.

57:17.440 --> 57:19.440
I'm blaming it being scary.

57:19.440 --> 57:20.440
But you know what?

57:20.440 --> 57:22.980
We've had village raids for years in Ragnarok Online.

57:22.980 --> 57:25.940
Yeah, but that's just the GMs playing tricks on you.

57:25.940 --> 57:26.940
So?

57:26.940 --> 57:27.940
Alright.

57:27.940 --> 57:30.680
Anyway, also this is very cool as well.

57:30.680 --> 57:36.600
Chocobo racing is going to be incorporated into Final Fantasy 11 along with breeding.

57:36.600 --> 57:40.720
So those of you guys that love to raise your own chocobos in Final Fantasy 7, now it's

57:40.720 --> 57:43.360
going to be incorporated into Final Fantasy 11.

57:43.360 --> 57:44.360
That is pretty cool.

57:44.360 --> 57:45.360
I got to say my hat's off to them.

57:45.360 --> 57:46.360
Can you get a black one?

57:46.360 --> 57:47.360
Can you get a gold one?

57:47.360 --> 57:48.360
I have no idea.

57:48.360 --> 57:49.360
We won't know until it comes out.

57:49.360 --> 57:50.800
You have to go race them at the gold saucer?

57:50.800 --> 57:52.040
I don't know.

57:52.040 --> 57:54.040
We'll see.

57:54.040 --> 57:56.560
Also there's going to be a Mog Locker.

57:56.560 --> 58:01.080
You can buy it for a price and hold additional items as well, for those that say my Mog House

58:01.080 --> 58:06.080
won't hold enough, and that's also kind of the reason why people go and get a mule.

58:06.080 --> 58:10.360
You know, a mule is a secondary character that you have to pay real life money to get.

58:10.360 --> 58:14.400
Also, now there's going to be a Colosseum.

58:14.400 --> 58:18.680
Don't really know what it's going to be yet, they just said a Colosseum.

58:18.680 --> 58:22.640
Well they have PVP and Ballista, so we don't know if it's going to be PVP or if it's going

58:22.640 --> 58:25.760
to be like like think about Final Fantasy 6 had a Colosseum and you would

58:25.760 --> 58:28.880
like kind of bed an item and then depending on if you won you get

58:28.880 --> 58:32.960
something better so who knows it could be a variety of things so we shall see

58:32.960 --> 58:36.600
so pretty exciting and this is an addition to new areas and stuff so it

58:36.600 --> 58:41.520
sounds like Final Fantasy 11 is learning from the poor reviews of Chains of

58:41.520 --> 58:45.560
Promothea and kind of adding a lot more oomph into this expansion it's gonna get

58:45.560 --> 58:48.200
some people back into the game here I come

58:48.200 --> 58:51.900
enough said well that's not the only thing squares working on though right

58:51.900 --> 58:58.900
right? I should say Squeenix. They're working on another MMO. What's this? Well, it's just

58:58.900 --> 59:04.900
a brand new MMO. It's not going to be Final Fantasy related, you know, but... Tracking

59:04.900 --> 59:11.740
Quest Online! But, uh, other details beyond that, nothing. They just know that they're

59:11.740 --> 59:18.260
working on it, so. Final Fantasy 13? Probably not. It could be Final Fantasy, it could be

59:18.260 --> 59:22.780
I did remember hearing them, they were working on another game and I do remember seeing something

59:22.780 --> 59:23.780
about this.

59:23.780 --> 59:27.100
It wasn't Final Fantasy, I can't remember what it was though, something that was like

59:27.100 --> 59:28.100
out of E3 last year.

59:28.100 --> 59:31.560
I seem to remember vaguely hearing something about this too, so I wonder if this is related

59:31.560 --> 59:33.700
or if it's something completely different.

59:33.700 --> 59:34.700
I don't know.

59:34.700 --> 59:37.980
But, yeah, we'll see.

59:37.980 --> 59:41.700
Alright, we're going to move on here now.

59:41.700 --> 59:46.700
I know that I don't get a website of the week segment here on this show, but let's pretend

59:46.700 --> 59:55.840
for once that I did get a website of the week segment.

59:55.840 --> 59:58.660
This would be my website of the week if I had the opportunity.

59:58.660 --> 01:00:09.240
It's a brand new website that launched this week, www.videogamevoters.org.

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:16.260
It's basically a place for you as a registered voter to take a stand against politicians

01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:21.860
who come up with these harebrained bills about preventing the violent video games.

01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:24.820
Once in a while, depending on the wording of the bill, it can be okay, but I'm talking

01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:30.060
about the cases where they compare the games to pornography and all that stuff.

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:33.100
So I've been saying throughout the past couple of shows, vote with your dollars, so now here

01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:40.280
you can vote with your votes, and it's basically a place to get people mobilized for action

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:45.300
in the political world in the name of gaming, and I think it's great.

01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:48.220
Here's a little quote from the website about what they're all about there.

01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:52.940
The Video Game Voters Network exists to empower Americans who play video games to take action

01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:57.060
against threats to this entertainment medium and to stay informed about the latest issues

01:00:57.060 --> 01:00:59.880
that could affect our choice in video game entertainment.

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:03.860
Video games are a modern form of entertainment entitled to the same creative and free speech

01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:09.980
protections afforded by the U.S. Constitution to older media such as movies, music and books.

01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:14.060
So join the Video Game Voters Network and speak up for games and gamer rights.

01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:19.940
a stand protect your games that's www.videogamevoters.org I urge you to sign

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:24.240
up for this site even if you don't agree with all of it maybe you'll find that

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:27.140
once you've read it you don't agree with everything maybe that they're gonna do

01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:33.000
at least you're educated and knowing is half the battle right yo Joe so bravo to

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.400
those guys for starting that up I think it's a good idea to get everybody

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:39.280
together to take action against this stuff and speak up and say you know what

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:43.280
gamers aren't a bunch of 15 year old guys who can't get laid there's a lot of

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:47.160
gamers over 18 who vote you guys in office and if you're gonna continue to

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:51.040
be ignorant about gaming which is what a lot of this stuff ends up being is

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:55.520
ignorance about gaming then we're going to remove you from office and put

01:01:55.520 --> 01:02:00.920
someone in there who's not as ignorant good idea any last-minute stories anyone

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:06.120
wants to share but of course all right what's up kind of on the same you know

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:12.740
level as half-life 2 survivor for the arcade global VR developer of arcade

01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:18.340
Machines has announced a new title for conversion to the arcade play and that

01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:24.200
would be Ubisoft's Far Cry Instincts, the console version of the Far Cry series.

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:31.960
Crysis is coming to the arcade and that should be pretty sweet. It will include a

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:36.680
high-definition monitor on deluxe systems and surround sound so realistic

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:40.000
players will feel like they're right in the middle of the action. Of course EA

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.320
sports is also developing an arcade edition of the Nascar game as well so

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:52.800
I have one for you Rob about Sid Meier. Cool! A new PC game that will allow you

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:56.720
to build your very own rail network lane tracks and deciding routes

01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:59.920
and designing trains called railroads with an exclamation point. Wait but there

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:04.720
was railroad tycoon. Alright it wasn't Sid Meier's railroad. Okay fine alright so fine

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:09.200
railroads. It's titled Sid Meier's railroads. Alright. It's a click and drag system delay

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:15.120
tracks, bridges, tunnels, blah blah blah. You can also, not only as your rail network

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:21.520
grows cities, industries, you organize cargo transport, provide passenger routes for commuters.

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:28.960
Fend off hobos. Stop it. You know, you'll need to basically watch the business side

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:32.520
as you are also dealing with the technical side. You know who will like this game a lot?

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:35.660
My dad. Because he used to work for the railroad. He's retired now but he worked for the railroad

01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:38.840
so he loves these types of things, so I'll share this with him.

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:44.680
You also have the ability to make your own maps and scenarios and do your dream layout

01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:47.660
in train table mode.

01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:52.840
And you can also challenge historical figures like Cornelius Vanderbilt and JP Morgan.

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:56.720
So okay, that's kind of interesting because it's like the civilization aspect there in

01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:57.720
railroading.

01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:58.720
That's cool!

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:05.280
And it has LAN or online play, competitive, cooperative, so it's going to be pretty big.

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:09.100
Again, Railroad Tycoon is one of those

01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:13.260
great classic games that you should definitely check out if you're

01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:14.620
interested in something like if you're

01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:18.620
you know kinda younger or into gaming or whatever and haven't checked out a lot of

01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:19.860
old PC

01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:23.740
gaming titles that are just fabulous. Civilization, definitely check that out

01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:28.060
and Railroad Tycoon is great. Oh, this game looks very pretty, that's cool.

01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:31.380
I hope it's easy to get into though. The problem with a lot of these

01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:34.860
PC sim type of games is that the learning curve is way too high.

01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:38.780
but hopefully uh... you know this will be easy to get into and civilization

01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:41.800
at least the original one had a pretty good learning curve on its own

01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:44.100
sift two and three were pretty good too, so I have faith

01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:48.380
that this will be good. It's looking pretty awesome so far. I mean I probably wouldn't be too

01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:50.220
into playing it but it looks pretty cool.

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:53.420
Alright, and comment from our chat room SSJ100Matt

01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:58.260
this game is gonna railroad the competition waka waka waka. Har har har.

01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:00.260
Oh, you win.

01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:03.540
Alright, let's get into our last story of the night which is going to be brought

01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:04.620
to us by

01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:05.860
Loki

01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:07.000
okay

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.740
were some crazy things people do to get an xbox three sixty

01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:14.460
one of them is to memorize pie

01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:18.840
that's right like apple cherry no pie is in

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:21.620
the number pie

01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:25.420
a happy belated pie day to our listeners cause you know march fourteenth just

01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:27.980
passed you know it's pie day

01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:29.260
anyways

01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:30.460
uh... mole

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:38.060
This 15-year-old student from Salem, Virginia, recited 8,784 digits of Pi from memory on

01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:39.060
Tuesday.

01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:44.180
His father promised to buy him an Xbox 360 if he succeeded his own personal goal, which

01:05:44.180 --> 01:05:47.540
was 10,790.

01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:55.220
He was actually trying to set the world record, which was, I think, previously 10,700, so

01:05:55.220 --> 01:06:02.220
he wanted to cut. Or actually no, I'm sorry, 10,625 set in 1978 by David Foria. However

01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:09.940
though, his dad teased him and saying because he did not reach his goal of 10,790, he would

01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:19.220
get an Xbox 360, but no game. Yeah, he only gets a core. So he can't even download something

01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:22.340
and download something off Xbox Live Arcade, he just gets a core.

01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:27.900
Ironically enough, 10,790, that's how many systems that were actually sold in Japan.

01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:30.460
Stop it.

01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:31.460
You know what, though?

01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:35.260
In the time it took him to learn to memorize that, the kid could have gone out and gotten

01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:38.420
a job and gotten the money to buy this Xbox 360, don't you think?

01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:39.420
Well, I guess it was.

01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:40.740
He was 15, maybe he can't work and everything.

01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:43.580
You can get a work permit at that age, can't you?

01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:44.580
Hell yeah.

01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:46.420
Yeah, so get a job!

01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:50.740
well then again though different states different you know that's true

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:54.300
that's labor laws so whatever floats your boat I guess if that's how you want

01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:55.380
to make money go for it

01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:58.580
all right well this is something that I've

01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:01.980
mentioned to you off the air before

01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:05.980
there's going to be an announcement next week about

01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:09.180
us and

01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:12.300
Fanime

01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:16.900
I'm excited about this huh and pie and no nope well maybe we'll bring pie

01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:21.460
to Fauna Mae. We'll see. Do you want to promise Punch and Pie?

01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:25.660
I think people should bring us pie. We do this show for free. I want you to bring me pie.

01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:31.620
I'm not gonna bake pies. But maybe Dark Sockrel will bake some pies since after

01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:32.700
all the

01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:36.700
emails do say you should be in the kitchen. No. I'll bake

01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:41.580
arsenic pie. Sounds like fun. I might go down for a day.

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:45.300
I'll check it out. We'll see. Alright, anyway,

01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:48.860
that's going to about wrap it up for tonight's program. And ribbons and bows.

01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:52.420
A few quick programming notes for you guys, for those of you that listen to Orange

01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:53.980
Lounge Radio 24-7.

01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:57.180
Just so you know, Pump Up the Volume will not be heard this week.

01:07:57.180 --> 01:08:02.140
Because of Comcast. That's right. However, I did get the ultimate geek as my tech,

01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:06.660
and he was awesome. That's cool. And then the guy who came to... He might be listening to this show tonight, who knows?

01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:10.940
I actually did, well, I wouldn't say he's like a geek geek, but he's into the same type of cool,

01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:15.420
He likes Monty Python and George Romero.

01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:17.860
So he was really awesome if you were listening.

01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:21.380
I totally forgot what your name was, because I actually do

01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:24.020
want to send a compliment to your boss.

01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:25.900
So if you are listening, email me at

01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:27.720
jamieatorangejonesradio.com.

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:29.060
I will totally write a letter of

01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:30.300
commendation to your boss.

01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:32.980
But also, he needs to fix your line.

01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:33.660
It's not him.

01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:35.220
We found out what it is.

01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:38.100
In fact, the tech who came over, the first thing he did

01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:40.020
was go in and pet Shermie.

01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:41.420
I was like, you're cool.

01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:44.720
So I've had nothing but good from Comcast lately, even though my service hasn't been great.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:47.960
When Loki and I lived together, we had a tech come over to the place that we were

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:50.880
living at, and the guy walked into the room and saw the arcade machine that

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:52.160
Loki had built and was like,

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:56.300
what do you guys do here? Dude, I still get stuff. I get, you know, people

01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:59.920
like, I order pizza these days, and he's like, didn't you used to live on- yeah.

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:04.380
Cause I recognize the arcade cabinet.

01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:07.860
That's great. I remember when you guys were building that.

01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:08.860
That's pretty cool.

01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:09.860
All right.

01:09:09.860 --> 01:09:14.020
But, um, but I would like to say, what happened is that in my neighborhood, um, someone cut

01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:19.100
the head line of a fiber optic cable, cost them $10,000 to repair it.

01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:20.100
What a bunch of jerks.

01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:23.060
And yeah, and so we were all out of service and what's happening is that while they're

01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:27.240
affecting the repairs and putting everything back together, we've been having really erratic

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:28.240
service.

01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:30.320
So I've been told to give it a week for it to clear up.

01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:34.220
So as a result, so that you guys don't have to put up with the crap that happened last

01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:36.740
week, I am not doing a show this Tuesday.

01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:38.220
I will be back the next week.

01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:41.420
Alright, but I will be on Wednesday night with the Rob Roberts show for some music and

01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:43.120
some geek chat and stuff.

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:48.340
And you know, whatever else comes up, we'll let you know about it on orangelaundraider.com.

01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:53.340
For now, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts, starting off with Loki.

01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:58.480
My bad, I completely forgot something I wanted to talk about and I'll make it really quick.

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:03.540
We have to talk about this, DDR Supernova, it was at the ASI event that was going on

01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:05.980
and there was some new stuff.

01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:11.580
One thing, of course, Betson, the manufacturer of this, said no upgrade units will be available.

01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:15.380
It's all new hardware, you can buy it straight, you know.

01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:20.900
They did show videos that were recorded at the event of the new songs, including Healing

01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:24.260
Division and also Chaos.

01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:31.940
Chaos which has 4 goddamn billion tempo changes and stops in it, including 164th stops.

01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:38.440
So it's absolutely insane and retarded, but it should be fun for people that want to challenge.

01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:44.580
Also they showed a little bit of the battle mode, which is just like dance magic mode.

01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:45.580
Loki got refuted.

01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:46.580
Oh.

01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:47.580
By Legend of Zaku.

01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:49.580
It just says it's not true at this time.

01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:50.580
Ah.

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:51.580
Oh snap.

01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:59.420
Alright, my final thought is my ears need to pop, so I'm gonna go chew gum.

01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:00.420
I'm sure you wanted to know that.

01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:02.980
Dark Soccer, your final thought?

01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:07.280
I have very conflicting emotions toward Comcast right now.

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:08.280
And reject false icons.

01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:09.280
All right.

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:10.280
Guitar Vader!

01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:15.120
Thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening to Orange Lounge Radio this week and supporting

01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:37.540
