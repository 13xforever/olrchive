66355	68677	All right, let's get back into some gaming news here.
82265	82905	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
110575	110875	DarkSakura.com
139016	142839	Sony is selling the Metreon complex and who do they sell it to?
143339	151765	Mall developer, the Westfield Group and the Forest City Enterprises real estate company for an undisclosed amount of money.
151845	158230	So Sony will continue to operate the official PlayStation store in the mall, but as for the rest of the stuff there...
159352	161754	Who knows what we could see going up in there pretty soon.
161834	163996	Maybe Abercrombie and Fitch, for all we know.
164036	165678	That would just be peachy, wouldn't it?
165698	166578	Boo-hiss.
166919	168820	No idea what's going to happen to the walk of game just yet.
170342	171062	Yeah.
171122	178849	But many of us DDR fans, like NorCal especially, with fond memories of Medtron, except for Loki who somehow missed it all, it's kind of sad.
179289	180871	It makes me a little verklempt.
180891	182212	A little bit.
182512	183753	Talk amongst yourselves.
184113	185034	Alright, but life goes on.
185415	186816	So, moving on...
187352	188113	to another story.
188433	195219	Loki, you got some interesting, you had some real great exclusives in the first part there about PlayStation 3 and Revolution.
195239	195759	What do you got now?
196300	204827	Well, this is kind of, you can file it under rumor, how Sony plans on combating the Revolution.
205368	211093	And the way they're going to do that, well, of course, it's going to be with the PlayStation 2 and the iToy.
212958	225425	What they're planning on doing is because the PlayStation 2 is already an established console system out there, they're still producing them, and they're anticipating that the price point is going to drop down to $99 in 2007.
226166	233430	And of course, with the iToy, they're anticipating that you'll be able to use this to create some really revolutionary games.
233750	238193	The only problem with that is the iToy doesn't work that good.
239538	240999	I know this from first-hand experience.
242400	243841	And let me put it this way.
245262	251006	Wiping windows down and looking like a jackass while dancing on screen, not revolutionary.
251226	253727	iToy Kinetic was fun for a day.
254528	259071	Waste of $50 because my apartment does not light good enough.
259291	261712	I mean, it just does not work for iToy.
262153	264054	And while I could go to Ikea and buy a lamp...
264727	269248	I'm not changing the house around to make the iToy work.
269268	278971	Granted, when they're showing off the iToy games and they're against a nice white backdrop, that's the perfect environment for the iToy.
279951	284472	But most of us people, we live in rooms with more than white in the room.
284492	286372	Like posters and paintings.
286432	287033	Exactly.
288533	288953	Not good.
289929	300275	But some of the other stuff that they're talking about, and this is actually kind of another thing that Xbox is doing too with their camera, is they're going to be using multiple cameras to track movement.
300935	302956	That's more something on the Xbox 360 front.
302976	303677	They're going to be using that.
303717	312402	In fact, they also showed how they can render your face in there by doing a screen cap of your face, you know, facing forward and sideways, and then render it 3D.
313082	317164	And they're also going to be using that kind of as an eye toy or revolution thing as well.
317184	318145	Let me put it this way.
318962	320342	and B, The Revolution.
321182	321582	No!
322963	326103	It wouldn't be that revolutionary if it were just that simple.
326463	327284	This is all rumor.
327424	330404	This is not good enough to combat the revolution thing.
331284	338546	There's other things that are going to set the PS3 apart from the revolution, just as there's going to be things that set Xbox 360 apart from it.
338826	341106	There's no need for these guys to all try and copy each other.
341126	345627	The only good thing about the PlayStation 2 is it's not going to be as expensive as the PlayStation 3.
348434	355699	Comments from our chatroom, www.orangeloungeradio.com We love the interactivity that taping live on Sunday nights brings us here.
355759	359022	GS191 says, iToy, good concept, terrible games.
359362	363025	What makes you think that the PS3 X360 camera is going to be better?
363985	364486	Good point.
365166	372291	Going back to the Metreon story there earlier, somebody had said... I'm trying to find the thing here.
373132	374353	Somebody had said that...
375808	382772	Old tech TV shows had been taped at the Metreon, so it kind of further... Oh, Tomokun said, dude, it had tech TV shows taped there.
383052	388135	Just to further add insult to injury to the whole, you know, tech TV is long gone type thing.
388235	388896	They had X-Play.
389016	390356	X-Play used to be recorded.
390476	392317	Or before X-Play, what the hell was it called?
392357	393018	Extended Play.
393098	396060	Extended Play was recorded there.
397560	397921	Sad.
398441	400822	And now it's going to be just a giant Abercrombie & Fitch.
400902	401282	Just wait.
402403	404064	Banana Republic going in there as well.
405635	406376	All right, moving in.
406476	408138	I made all that up, by the way.
408218	412544	Moving on, EA, we talked about in the first half a little bit there.
413104	424979	The VP over at EA, Dr. I'm going to say this, so horrible, Jens Uwe Intat, foresees that there will be a shift coming within the next 10 years.
426046	431588	CDs, DVDs, and box games will be as antiquated as cassette tapes and vinyl records.
432108	435309	What are they going in favor of there?
435550	437070	Downloadable media.
437510	442192	They're saying that the downloadable media is going to be the shift there in 10 years there.
443135	450337	and of course you look at the success of iTunes and you think it's just a matter of time before movies start being distributed the same way.
450397	452078	Heck, it's already happening on iTunes.
452478	455379	Some shows that maybe aren't even doing that successful on TV.
455439	456179	Well, I don't know.
456239	461401	I'm thinking The Office does really, really well on iTunes and it does okay on TV.
461781	466162	But it does really well on iTunes so it might be the future outlet for TV.
466462	469143	And of course independent vidcasting getting bigger and bigger.
469423	472584	Well now, why not the same model apply to games?
473041	475463	Well, they're also probably going to start streaming.
475483	483229	You have the DirecTV tab that's going to be coming to the Xbox Live, your desktop there.
484070	489595	They're also going to be having location-free players for the PlayStation 3.
490115	500424	Also, you've got the news that PlayStation 3 in Korea is going to start doing direct downloads of games straight to your hard drive because they want to combat piracy there, and they're going to offer them at less than retail.
503585	507166	And hell, we're doing it right now with the Xbox Live Arcade, just in a smaller format.
507406	513608	You know, I went to a panel at KatsuCon, and I asked a question about this, and I practically got laughed at.
514228	521070	And people were saying, Xbox Live Arcade does not pose a threat to the regular system of downloading games.
521090	528492	And I'm thinking, okay, well now I've got this EA vice president backing me up, which I need to point out, he's actually Electronic Arts Europe vice president, so sorry.
528772	529753	I'm not clarifying that earlier.
530714	536078	That this downloadable games thing is going to be more and more of a force, I think.
536678	537559	So, we'll see.
537619	539701	Now, one thing he does say that, you know,
540633	542614	is a bit of an interesting point here.
543314	550696	Apple has kept their song prices at 99 cents per song, and this is a low figure that kind of makes people in the music business a little bit angry here.
551396	553176	iTunes essentially has a monopoly.
554137	562079	Dr. Entente seems to think that with so many consoles available, there's not going to be a monopoly possible if this model works with games.
563126	563887	It's not going to happen.
564107	564888	I can tell you this much.
565188	566629	And here's why it's not going to happen.
566669	570773	Because you have all the major retailers that make a lot of money off of these games.
571414	573296	Also, you've got rental chains.
574056	578360	If we all start streaming media, what's going to happen to the whole rental market?
578421	578941	It's gone.
579622	583105	You've got GameStop and freaking EB.
583125	588450	They're the same company now, but their whole business is game purchasing and stuff.
589372	590273	It's not going to happen.
591454	598780	If that happens, they're going to lose money from all these different outlets and then... Well, what about moving with the seas of change, though?
598840	603964	Tower Records doesn't still primarily make their business off records in the sense that we know them.
604344	610449	Blockbuster realizes that people like the Netflix model, so they copy it and do their own thing.
610469	615253	What's to say that GameStop isn't one of the online services that decides to get in on that?
615293	615793	I mean, who knows?
616034	618836	This is obviously all huge amounts of speculation, but you know...
620245	621066	It's a good question to ask.
621086	622287	Where will gaming be in 10 years?
622347	623408	It's an excellent idea.
623508	629035	Unfortunately, those 28 hard drives that they were packaging with the Xbox 360s, not going to work.
629055	631097	Okay, but in 10 years, we're not going to be talking Xbox 360.
631137	634581	We're going to be talking Xbox 1080 or something.
634621	634921	I don't know.
637124	637685	Alright, whatever.
637705	638526	Anyway, forget it.
640407	642268	All right, moving on.
642588	643808	We got another story here.
644328	647189	Several stories, actually, from DarkSakura.
647349	657252	Since we had a little comment there from the Electronic Arts Vice President over in Europe, why not give our pals over in Europe a little more information on what's going on in their neck of the woods?
657412	658552	And Jamie, you keep tabs on that?
658592	658952	What's going on?
658972	660053	We thought they were gone.
660293	661893	We thought we heard the last of them.
662473	664194	Acclaim is back.
664734	665014	Really?
665714	668335	Yes, with a free MMO, actually.
668415	668515	Oh.
669412	670993	It's called BOTS.
671793	673014	It looks like it's all capitalized.
673314	675635	I'm already bored.
675795	679477	Basically, they're describing it as a title that will appeal to everyone.
680858	687681	Basically, you start off with adaptable, upgradable little robots that are supposedly really cute.
687701	688461	I can do cute.
690049	695494	Story about some evil virus, PvP, capture the flag, that kind of stuff.
697276	700699	But you were supposed to have these near infinite combinations of upgrades.
700959	704543	You know, there was a game like this back in the days of the Sega CD.
705583	707665	It also reminds me of the Enix SNES game RoboTrek.
707685	707825	Yeah.
707865	708746	But, um...
726596	728557	At any rate, they're working on this.
729137	735781	There's actually a new Acclaim Games website where they have their beta tests up there to register for.
736161	741544	There's also a future title coming out called, it's a martial arts MMO called Nine Dragons.
742044	746567	But if you just go to Acclaim.com, it's the first link on there.
747507	748628	The first little image there.
749104	750004	I think I'll sign up for it.
750024	750865	It looks really cute.
768394	769835	It actually looks pretty neat.
770396	770976	This is funny.
770996	772077	We got a comment in our chat room here.
772118	774900	Ranma says, I saw the site for Acclaim's bots.
775040	777222	It looks just like the Ragnarok Online page.
777322	777883	It does.
777983	781006	It's laid out just like a website for a Korean MMO.
781666	784609	I love Ragnarok Online, so I think I'll give the bots a try.
784629	785570	All right.
786671	793577	Ragnarok Online certainly was cute, and it was the only game I've ever played that would allow my male character to wear a bow in his head.
795795	796978	I still have that photo.
797098	799522	It was on my cell phone for forever.
799562	800264	Anyway, moving on.
800524	801326	I miss Ragnarok.
806912	830659	Um, anyway, uh, next up, uh, a comment by, uh, uh, Roger Bennett, who is the general director of, uh, UK Video Games Publisher Trade Body, ELSPA, said there's complete and utter nonsense about a speech made in Parliament by the Labour MP, Keith Vaz, uh, stating, uh, about new laws, or, relating to video game ratings.
830699	831519	I brought this up earlier.
833260	833340	Um...
835442	840108	Basically, gamesindustry.biz was told, and I quote,
850780	859323	Vaz was proposing an amendment to the Video Recordings Act in 1984 that would make it mandatory for video games to receive content ratings the same way that films do.
860584	867166	It's a voluntary... The PEGI rating system is all voluntary to coincide with that.
867806	870927	But he was arguing in Parliament that the current system...
873609	887015	where basically it sees the PEGI ratings being complemented by the British Board of Film Classification to go along the same lines, but they're saying that's very confusing.
890017	891618	Let me get the next quote on here.
893179	896640	It's a very long article that I've been digesting over this.
898621	907569	But basically, it was going back, Bennett stated, the fact of the matter is that we're one of only two countries in the whole 27 states in the European Union who have mandatory ratings.
908070	913335	Everywhere else in Europe, these ratings are on the boxes, the PEGI ratings, and they make informed decisions for their kids.
914876	918920	The more you take the responsibility away from the parents, the less responsibility they'll take.
919320	923284	As soon as you take responsibility away from the people, then they rely on others to do it for them.
923924	925686	The whole process is mindless in my view.
926126	935315	At the end of the day, as long as the information is there, we should leave it to the parents and guardians, to those responsible for young people, to make informed decisions about what they should or shouldn't watch.
936425	945228	The blame culture in which we seem to live these days is a result of the promotion of the nanny state, no question about it.
945628	948369	It's always somebody else's fault and they have to have somebody else to blame.
949669	951590	That right there is my argument.
953011	954231	This guy is my hero now.
956596	959098	Let's bring down the old OLR hero wall.
959638	963941	I'm going to print out his photo at Kinko's and put it on the wall.
964761	971365	Because I don't think it's ever been stated better than I've seen it in print there.
972186	981011	And I really do think that's what it comes down to, is that we have these figures in government trying to basically...
982570	984213	And this, you know, it's not just here.
984473	985094	This is proof.
985154	985895	It is everywhere.
986336	997332	Trying to dictate what the people see, what the people watch, take responsibility away from the people, take away accountability from the people, and put it in the hands of government to babysit them.
997805	998505	And you know what?
999146	1012210	It's been happening more, especially, and I hate to say it, especially since 9-11, it's been happening more and more, where we've had our governments taking control over what they view as protection action, whether it's in censorship of video games.
1012830	1020133	Not just that, I think more so, I mean, certainly I noticed it then too, but Janet Jackson, Boobie, Super Bowl, hello, yeah, that was a huge...
1021906	1034376	What we're seeing is, you know, especially in, and I think that's actually even more of a slap in the face to those of us in the United States where we're founded on these principles of free speech and human rights where
1036161	1036521	All right.
1036541	1037242	I think, though, that...
1065530	1073472	the whole especially with, you know, Jackie Poo his whole agenda with, you know, seeing this come up.
1073912	1084515	I think it really is more of a more of a view overall that they're not wanting us to be accountable for ourselves.
1084975	1090036	They take the power away from the people and we're left just blindly following what they tell us to.
1091757	1093117	That's my theory behind all of this.
1093237	1093577	I think
1093991	1095512	That it all goes hand in hand.
1096472	1100254	Send those cards and letters to Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com That's just my opinion.
1101134	1102235	That's just my observation.
1102295	1109738	But again, I find it very sad that governments are having to step in and tell parents how to do their jobs.
1110438	1112739	Trying to dictate what you can and can't do.
1114340	1116461	One more bit of European news.
1118141	1121423	Is the PSP Gigapack price has been slashed.
1122499	1134266	Um, basically, uh, for any Northern Irish gamers hoping to pick up the PSP Gigapack, um, GameStop has slashed, uh, basically, uh, 25 pounds off the price.
1134666	1141290	You can pick up the pack, which includes a PSP, a stand USB cable, and a 1 gigabyte memory stick for, uh,
1143475	1146096	189.99 in Northern Ireland branches of GameStop.
1146637	1152520	Game has also been lowered to 289.99 euros in GameStop stores throughout all of Ireland.
1154261	1159563	Outside, however, the price is still 214.99 or in euros 309.99.
1162645	1166327	So go to Ireland if you want to get your gigapack cheap.
1168508	1169589	Also, release dates.
1170430	1171190	Oh yes, what's coming up?
1171210	1172551	We can't go without that, can we?
1173011	1174891	It's been a little while, so now we're into a new month.
1174971	1175612	So what's coming out?
1176492	1179973	Well, tomorrow we have Snowboard Kids DS.
1180713	1185595	On the 9th we have Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter for Xbox 360.
1185675	1186515	These are UK dates.
1187135	1188635	On the 10th, 24 The Game.
1189456	1190176	Wouldn't that make you happy?
1191072	1193534	I've been bad at watching 24.
1211087	1212288	I didn't watch any TV.
1212488	1213408	Except for The Apprentice.
1213488	1215848	I watched The Apprentice once and it wasn't even that good.
1217149	1231653	For the rest of the games coming out, also in the 10th, Combat 121, Fight Night Round 3, Guilty Gear X2 Reload on PC, Lemmings for the PSP, Namco Museum 50th Anniversary Arcade Collection on the Game Boy Advance, NBA 2K6, NHL 2K6,

1251229	1258750	WonderDog Harold would just like you all to know that watching 24 caused him to have a dream of naked Jean Smart from Designing Women who plays... Oh my god!
1259091	1262331	She's on this new season, so... Oh my god, she still has a career?
1262491	1265412	Yes, she actually has a great... She was the blonde one.
1265552	1266732	I only saw... Wasn't she?
1266752	1273413	Yeah, I only saw the first four episodes, or the first two long episodes, the first four hours, and she had a pretty badass role, I gotta say.
1273513	1275174	So, you know, her career is jump-starting.
1275574	1276454	Anyway, but she's not in the game.
1276474	1277414	So, anyway...
1278128	1279709	We'd love to follow up UK release dates.
1280249	1280789	That was it, right?
1281229	1281489	Yeah.
1282049	1282649	We'd love to follow up.
1283109	1288411	I've been cutting everybody off tonight with total randomness, and I apologize, but I've just been pent up for two weeks in Virginia.
1289631	1292152	Loki, what's going on with US release dates?
1292312	1293012	Lots of stuff.
1293052	1294992	Well, of course, March is a huge month for games.

1302074	1305315	Other releases coming out this week, Championship Bowling for the Xbox.
1306312	1307753	Yeah, that's going to be great.
1308213	1312634	Dragon Ball Z Shin Budokai, the Dragon Ball Z fighting game, finally hits the PSP.
1313815	1317296	Also, we have Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter also coming out on the Xbox.

1337435	1340837	I hang my head in deep shame because I want to play this game.
1342058	1342918	More PSP games.
1342979	1347441	Pursuit Force and Samurai Warriors are heading towards the PSP.
1348002	1353865	A brand new RPG coming out, Shadow Hearts from the New World, which actually looks pretty decent, on PS2.
1354666	1359249	And Spongebob Yellow Avenger on the PSP, followed by Tales of Phantasia 4.
1360510	1361351	The Game Boy Advance.
1361551	1376019	Other notable stuff coming out later on the month here, we of course have Driver Parallel Lines coming out the week of the 13th, as well as Metal Gear Solid 3 Subsistence, which should be really sweet, The Outfit for Xbox 360.
1377535	1381197	And then finally, the week of the 20th, we've got a couple games coming out.
1381317	1392082	Most notably, The Godfather is hitting Xbox and PlayStation 2, as well as Blazing Angels is coming out on Xbox and Xbox 360.
1392582	1397804	And of course, the ever-anticipated Elder Scrolls 4 finally hitting the Xbox 360.
1397884	1399665	Finally, and me and Mike Hadamari.
1399845	1400746	I've got to put that in there.
1400806	1402887	And Metroid Prime Hunters, because those are really good games as well.
1402907	1403187	Tetris DS?
1404000	1408482	TesterDS also that week and also Metal Gear Racer 2 and Mega Man Power Rift.
1408522	1411583	Oh, my bank account is going to cry the end of this month.
1411743	1413703	It's going to be a sad week at my bank.
1413783	1414904	And Worms Open Warfare.
1414964	1416684	Now I'm actually looking forward to that game.
1417664	1427428	Alright, just so you know, WonderDog Harold would also like to remind you in regards to our previous conversation, Gene Smart was also the voice of Mrs. Possible in Kim Possible, just for those of you following her career.
1427708	1428968	And beat me in Indiana the 29th.
1429428	1429728	Thank you.
1430529	1431789	Which does not feature Gene Smart.
1432871	1433611	Maybe Beatmania 2.
1434151	1436392	But it's also launched the same day as Karaoke Revolution Country.
1437212	1441933	These games that we love, Beatmania and all that stuff, and we love US games too, don't get us wrong.
1441953	1448194	We love games from all around, but Japan certainly brings us lots and lots and lots of memorable, great games.
1448674	1453175	There's a magazine over there that has a lot of clout over in the Japan gaming market.
1453215	1454416	It's called Famitsu.
1454956	1459957	They recently polled their readers to vote on their all-time favorite 100 games
1461337	1464279	Dragon Quest VII, Final Fantasy III, Tactics Ogre, Final Fantasy IV, Machi,
1486477	1487659	4.
1486697	1487659	Dragon Quest VIII 3.
1488980	1489621	Dragon Quest III 2.
1489661	1490903	Final Fantasy VII 1.
1491203	1491904	Final Fantasy X
1500050	1503833	That makes sense because Final Fantasy X has this humongous fandom built around it.
1504233	1508076	Right, and that's not surprising in any way, but let me get that straight.
1508096	1513641	That's four Final Fantasies and three Dragon Quests comprising the top ten.
1513881	1523589	Might I also point out Dragon Quest V, number 11, Dragon Quest IV, number 14, Dragon Quest II, number 17, Final Fantasy VIII, number 22, Final Fantasy IX, 24, Final Fantasy VI, 25.
1523629	1524089	Shall I continue?
1527532	1528193	So they like their RPGs.
1528213	1529394	It's not surprising at all.
1529794	1530214	It's not.
1530374	1530995	It's really not.
1531235	1533777	And I'm actually really not at all surprised to see Tactics Ogre in there.
1533797	1534938	Where was Final Fantasy Tactics?
1537260	1539862	I don't see it in the top 50.
1539982	1540742	Maybe in the bottom 50.
1541143	1541983	Let me keep looking here.
1543625	1546427	Final Fantasy Tactics I know had a big following for a while too.
1546467	1550590	But Tactics Ogre completely does not surprise me.
1550610	1551631	84 Final Fantasy Tactics.
1552131	1552692	It's on the list.
1554076	1556217	Do they have any of the PC Engine titles in there?
1556397	1557537	Like Dracula X?
1558558	1559938	I don't know if I saw anything.
1561459	1562119	You know what?
1562299	1563339	Or Emerald Dragon?
1563359	1563999	What about that?
1564240	1564940	Animal Crossing's 43.
1565260	1566440	There you go.
1566520	1567080	That's something.
1567240	1567981	Metal Gear Solid, 50.
1569481	1569841	Let's see.
1569861	1571702	I need to know where Dracula X is on that.
1571882	1572922	I don't think it's there.
1573022	1573262	What?
1573783	1574243	Gradius, 98.
1575737	1576457	I'm looking, I'm looking.
1577697	1582598	They published this over on next-gen.biz, by the way, is where I'm pulling this from.
1583179	1587459	I don't see a single Castlevania game on here, but I'm eyeing it.
1587479	1589080	I might be missing it, so I apologize if I'm wrong there.
1589100	1590640	That wounds me in my soul.
1590920	1593341	So, what do you think?
1594121	1598322	They are smoking crack, but Famitsu is notorious for being bastards.
1598842	1599842	Well, you know...
1600543	1601524	Dragon Quest VIII Dragon Quest VIII
1632007	1637229	Um, moving on, let's go over to Loki for some reports on the homebrew scene.
1637909	1639070	Of course, as always.
1639670	1644832	Um, starting off of some wonderful games coming to the PSP homebrew scene.
1645152	1647713	First one is a Halo clone.
1647733	1653275	That's right, they're working on a Halo kind of port to the PSP.
1653376	1654516	It's based on the
1655131	1657313	Game or Multiplayer App Iris.
1657953	1662997	And it's actually a mod, but it's going to be containing four-player deathmatch type of gameplay.
1663557	1666159	So that's kind of being worked on right now.
1666680	1671383	As far as stuff that's out there right now, I've already mentioned this in the last podcast, but got to cover it again.
1671984	1680530	The new Super Nintendo emulator SNES 9X version 0.4 has been updated with wireless multiplayer.
1680710	1682532	So you can actually go ahead and play...
1683578	1689400	People near you at some Street Fighter, and they've actually clocked it at 60 frames per second while playing.
1689920	1690720	So that's kind of cool.
1691581	1701204	Other homebrew stuff that's going to be coming out, though, for the PSP, they've created an ISO loader using the exploit in Grand Theft Auto.
1701984	1708846	Another thing that they've also been able to do is launch Grand Theft Auto on version 1.5 firmware.
1709146	1712167	And for those who have played Grand Theft Auto's Liberty City stories,
1712486	1719412	you'll know that it forces you to upgrade to 2.0 so they've actually bypassed all that and got it to run on that same firmware.
1719892	1741570	The other thing that they've also launched is an upgrade to that because they're worried that people are going to be pirating games and stuff so they've actually got a UMD loader for firmware 1.5 that will run any game that will force you to update to 2.0 or higher in 1.5 if you have the UMD because a lot of people do have games out there they want to play but they want to play their homebrew stuff
1742574	1742954	Now they can.
1743315	1745476	So that's kind of cool.
1745556	1750440	Other things, there was also kind of teased a little bit for the DS.
1753343	1757946	Basically, you can have remote access to your PC using the DS, and that was kind of cool.
1757966	1761569	They showed a little picture of that, but no release on that yet.
1763291	1765052	All right.
1765112	1771117	Keep us posted on what's going on and whatever they install Linux on next and all that fun stuff.
1772109	1775071	Yeah, I was waiting for the 360 for Linux.
1775972	1780835	Alright, DarkSakura, you're going to get all the fun stories tonight on violence and political stuff.
1781415	1782136	What do you got next?
1782536	1784297	I'm all about the violence.
1784538	1786519	I mean, the politics.
1787620	1788800	The politics, the violence.
1790241	1791242	I'm all about the violence.
1791422	1792023	Alright, we know.
1792763	1794226	Okay, guess what?
1795027	1802257	With the increase of video game violence, we have crime going way down.
1802638	1803299	Isn't that awesome?
1803339	1808046	Wait, crime went down when video game violence went up?
1809157	1817340	Basically, with the increase of the first-person shooter genre, crime... I'm sorry, I was backwards on that one.
1817360	1817860	Oh, that's alright.
1818260	1820181	Well, you know, we already went over that before.
1820561	1823282	But the crime-based action games are declining.
1824222	1827584	But still, that means there's more of a demand over here than there is over there.
1827784	1828364	That says something.
1829694	1837320	But basically, I'm tongue-tied, excuse me.
1838220	1856033	But they were basically saying that even though the success of Grand Theft Auto and all that, you know, has been so big that there's still not so many of them coming out, that the first-person shooter is really taking prevalence in the whole video game industry.
1856253	1856453	Yeah.
1858964	1876234	We did have an earlier story that did state, I remember doing something on the show a while ago, that despite the violent video games coming out, people get their aggressions out on them or something, because overall, crime rate... The thing is, though, is that the study is still there, though, at the Department of Justice.
1877354	1887160	There are charts proving that since, what was it, 93, when the PlayStation came out, that there has been a decrease in youth-based violence.
1888470	1888750	All right.
1888790	1889712	All right, well, two...
1907003	1908463	DarkSakura, you ready to get angsty?
1908483	1908843	When am I not?
1945214	1955660	My first, well my big only FU is I'm tired of being the emotional receptacle of the world.
1959042	1963745	You know, I can take, and take, and take, and take.
1964725	1970989	And I don't know if I'm just easily ventable to, but I have my limits too.
1971469	1974191	It's not really an FU, it's more of an FU toward myself.
1975040	1981063	Just because I can't... I have to get my aggression out too, damn it.
1981564	1983845	And I don't see why everybody else... Let it all out, girl.
1983865	1984265	Let it all out.
1984325	2002415	I don't see why everybody in the universe feels that they can just tell me their whole life story like it's some horrible thing and it's going to really, you know... Like some complete stranger starts telling me about how bad their life sucks and I'm like, okay.
2003696	2004496	Why are you telling me this?
2004738	2005918	Did you tell them to stop?
2006838	2009159	I just sort of said, I have to go now.
2010439	2027023	But it's like, it's been happening more often than not lately that I've been getting rants, you know, in defense of people, you know, I never really mind hearing it, you know, if you need to vent to me, say, hey, I think you're a good person to talk to, let's talk about it.
2027303	2033145	But when it comes out, you know, completely unprovoked, I'm like, okay, what did that have to do with anything?
2033165	2034485	This is so out of left field.
2035123	2041365	and especially without, you know, even saying, hey, is this a good time for you emotionally for me to vent to?
2043406	2062554	You need to make sure that when you're going to talk to somebody that they're going to be in a position to listen to you objectively and not just... Because, you know, say that the person you're talking to is really depressed, really stressed out, really just having an awful day and then you start talking about how much your life sucks.
2062574	2063554	How's that going to make them feel?
2064696	2066837	The moral of the story is get a live journal.
2066877	2067177	Vlog it.
2067237	2069439	The moral of this though is if you have a problem...
2086201	2093948	and you need to vent to somebody, make sure that your intended venting audience is in a position that they're going to be able to withstand your venting.
2094108	2099393	That's www.myspace.com That's where the internet goes to die.
2099453	2101555	Tom will be your friend when no one else will.
2101615	2102216	Just so you know.
2103297	2107921	But I'm serious, so it's... I never mind listening to my friends when they need me.
2108301	2109322	I am always there.
2109762	2111564	And listeners, I am there for you.
2112185	2112485	Okay?
2113234	2119779	But make sure that if you are going to vent to me that I am not having the utter shit of the day before you do.
2119799	2120999	Thank you.
2121660	2123721	Loki.
2124502	2131927	Really the only thing I'm kind of frustrated at is Xbox Live's arcade, or not really their arcade, their online play for full auto.
2132327	2137531	The people playing full auto keep jumping out of the games like they're playing Mario Kart DS or something.
2138291	2165756	and granted you know I'm not too worried about I mean because I understand people will do that and you know I don't think that it's a huge deal but the fact is you know I'm playing the game I'm not even doing that well I'm getting like sixth place and I'm still you know taking the spot and I'm willing to you know take the sixth place and not get that many points but it doesn't even count because everyone drops out of the game and so you know I waste time you know playing through these races for nothing and also god damn it I'm doing so good in those races and I hit a damn like
2166351	2173375	Something will fly on the street like a little apple or something and my car will flip into the air like 50 feet because the physics are all fucked up.
2174856	2180599	It's really frustrating, but goddamn at least I beat those stupid gang war missions because I don't want to break something.
2181940	2184162	That's it.
2184242	2193167	I was actually in a really crappy mood all day because PMS for men or something is what I've been going through today, but actually the show has put me in a much better mood.
2193809	2199212	So I thank you guys for having a happy, super-duper show tonight, because I'm actually in a better mood.
2199492	2202393	And I feel like throughout my randomness and my rants, I've been able to get it out.
2202493	2208616	So I guess my only FU that is left is FU to the Oscars for daring to compete with our program tonight.
2208656	2210377	You're going down, Stuart.
2211217	2213018	Mr. Jon Stewart, you're going down, buddy.
2213778	2214999	Orange Lounge, thank you.
2215819	2217500	Spike, you have any angst you need to get out?
2217840	2220702	I mean, with a name like Spike, you gotta be an angry person, right?
2221622	2223603	Well, actually, I have two things, and they're both
2223976	2225437	directed towards Capcom.
2226918	2235642	The first one is that as cool as I think it is that you can play as the robot masters in Mega Man Powered Up, these new character designs have to go.
2237023	2244107	Because Mega Man is not meant to be one of those Duplo Block characters, and the fact that he is, baby Jesus cries for.
2245808	2246168	Second,
2247557	2251500	Capcom is putting out a collection of their classic arcade games.
2251600	2254743	It's a follow-up to their arcade classics line, recently launched.
2255563	2256544	The Remixed Pack.
2257224	2265471	And for some reason, in their infinite wisdom, they see fit to take up valuable space on that UMD with Quiz and Dragons.
2267685	2267965	Why?
2268146	2269968	Quiz and Dragons is badass.
2269988	2270649	You shut up.
2270749	2272331	I love that game.
2272491	2276756	Do you know how many quarters I wasted at the local pizzeria playing Quiz and Dragons?
2277056	2280981	And I screamed like a little girl when I found that game in MAME like years ago.
2281461	2282442	So sit down.
2283163	2283864	Are you serious?
2284024	2285326	I am fucking serious.
2286209	2287530	What the hell is Quiz and Dragons?
2287550	2288450	It was Quiz!
2288870	2289611	It was a Quiz show!
2289631	2290772	Choose Quiz or Dragons!
2291012	2292593	I choose Quiz!
2292833	2293513	Okay, good, Dad.
2293653	2294654	It was a Quiz thing.
2294954	2296535	It was a Quiz thing with dragons.
2296555	2297555	I'll have the vegetarian.
2300237	2300537	Alright.
2303418	2303879	Alright.
2304939	2305840	People, alright, well.
2306560	2312443	Just for the record, I want to say, even though Spike got a little angsty there, you know, Spike is actually just one of the most cuddly guys I know.
2312503	2313204	He's a nice boy.
2315310	2340517	so uh moving on he just has dragons he just has some strong opinions about very good games that Capcom put out that were horribly underrated like Black Tiger absolutely I love Black Tiger but Quiz and Dragons Loki speaking of uh dragon type things okay actually this game has nothing to do with dragons I don't know what the hell that was just just just take over wow that was an
2342315	2343776	We have to stand back for a second.
2343976	2346318	That was the most awesome transition ever.
2346398	2348059	Anyways, shut up.
2348139	2348559	I told you.
2348800	2350160	I'm having an off night tonight.
2351468	2353129	Two and a half weeks of... Forget it.
2353229	2353809	Just go.
2354469	2362173	Speaking of quizzes and dragons, Soul Calibur the movie is actually being worked on right now because you know what?
2362593	2364994	Apparently some movie studio out there is like, you know what?
2365355	2366495	We have money to burn.
2367095	2376680	Let's burn some money and... Yeah, anyways, they launched their website for this and it teases that the movie doesn't show anything.
2376860	2379001	What, it was like a Nostradamus quote or something?
2379021	2379681	Yeah.
2380262	2380662	Yeah.
2381328	2382508	What is this?
2382568	2383989	www.soulcaliberofthemovie.com or something?
2384009	2394352	www.soulcaliberofthemovie.com and it loads up this wonderful strive to understand what I have found through my... Just stop.
2394372	2395512	You're not Mr. Movie Phone.
2395552	2395992	Just stop.
2397252	2401073	Anyway, so it puts up stupid little text on there.
2401093	2402374	And not a single picture of Ivy.
2403134	2405294	And this sword shall smite the earth.
2405495	2406335	Okay.
2406595	2406735	Look.
2407848	2409729	I thought it was bullshit when I first looked at it.
2409749	2411130	I said, ah, fan thing, bullshit.
2411730	2413851	But I was like, okay, maybe there's something going on here.
2413871	2427919	So I put on my Google hat, and I went over to Google, and I started searching all around, and sure enough, I found this page on backstage.com, and it shows films that are currently in development, in the early development process, and sure enough, there it is.
2428299	2430340	Soul Calibur the movie, action.
2430660	2432821	Look at this, Romania, China, and Canada.
2432861	2434262	I guess that's where they're going to be filming this.
2434782	2436444	VJP Agarwal Canada Almost Resembles Romania
2454085	2454606	and China.
2454786	2460130	Well, it's just like the Oscars are on tonight, the big movie tonight, Brokeback Mountain.
2461291	2463293	If it weren't for all the French people and snow.
2463513	2463933	Wait, hold on.
2463973	2466556	But they're saying Brokeback Mountain is driving all this tourism to Wyoming.
2466796	2467817	It was filmed in Canada.
2470419	2472100	Which is, you know, amazing.
2472941	2474042	Anyway, let's see.
2474222	2475463	I'm still trying to find this guy.
2475483	2476904	Let's figure out what else he was affiliated with.
2476924	2478866	The executive producer there.
2479827	2481528	Such wonderful films as...
2484229	2485609	I don't know if this is the same one here.
2486270	2487370	That can't be the same one.
2487990	2488270	I don't know.
2488290	2488810	More to come.
2488830	2489171	More to come.
2489191	2490551	I'll do research and get back to you guys.
2490571	2491411	He hasn't made Jack.
2491751	2494452	For now, let's go back to a story about Electronic Arts.
2495012	2497333	Of course, they make a lot of their money off those NFL games, right?
2498794	2504555	The NFL and the Players Association are currently involved in a debate over salaries and players' cuts, etc., etc.
2505516	2510557	Unless they get to an agreement, they're going to maybe go on strike and maybe there'll be a lockout in 2008.
2510597	2510957	Who knows?
2514091	2525915	If there is some antitrust that goes in here, if the antitrust rules go into play with this whole strike or whatever, it would void Electronic Arts' contract with the NFL.
2526395	2529196	And that would really suck for EA if that happened.
2529796	2530236	Ubern.
2530736	2531536	Poor babies.
2531716	2532997	So they better hope there's no strike.
2533017	2533917	They don't deserve that.
2534437	2536038	We'll see.
2536838	2539419	I know a lot of you guys that listen to this program probably don't play those games.
2539439	2540819	But for those that do, there you go.
2541600	2542480	Loki, what else you got?
2542500	2543080	My husband does.
2544193	2551276	Anyways, a couple weeks ago, there was this wonderful little arcade show in Japan where they showed off some really cool stuff.
2551456	2551996	Yes, that's right.
2552837	2557779	AOU 2006, they had a couple wonderful highlights here we're going to cover.
2558139	2561821	The first one being Time Crisis 4, because, you know, Time Crisis rocks.
2562561	2567643	And Soul Calibur 3 is finally making its way to the arcade, as well as some other games.
2567663	2571625	Taiko no Tatsujin coming out now with Super Mario Bros.
2571705	2573546	songs, so that should be pretty cool.
2574915	2585052	Other things, of course, Half-Life 2 Survivor, which is going to be the arcade version of Half-Life 2, kind of with a lot of Deathmatch stuff there.
2587095	2587897	Let's see here.
2588763	2610785	Also, some stuff from Sega, Virtual Fighter 5, which looks pretty cool, and House of the Dead 4, which is really neat, better graphics of course, and they even have a version that's kind of one of those, you know, arcade ride simulator type of things, with a 100 inch screen, and it actually, you know, they strap you in and it rotates around and kind of coincides with the movie.
2612622	2623724	Let's see, other things, of course, would be Virtual Strikers 4, you know, for your soccer fans, and some new brain training game.
2624504	2626024	Hmm, interesting.
2628425	2628825	So yeah.
2628865	2635946	Something of note for those of you local here to the Sacramento area, the movie theater over in Roseville currently has a test machine of House of the Dead 4.
2637646	2640107	I was there last night, it was rather impressive.
2640147	2641947	Does it still have the awful voice acting?
2642677	2642937	Yes!
2643237	2643777	Yay!
2644017	2649999	And that Lindbergh board is putting out some textures that amazed the hell out of me.
2650039	2650339	Really.
2651199	2653700	Awesome 3D and bad voice acting.
2654120	2656241	I need to go spill coke on that machine.
2658421	2660382	Wake me when Typing of the Dead 2 comes out.
2661422	2662603	Dude, I love Typing of the Dead.
2662743	2663223	I do too.
2663283	2666944	That's why I'm not... I want to do a cosplay where I strap a Dreamcast to my back.
2666964	2667344	Been done.
2667364	2668164	People have done that.
2668524	2669204	People have done it.
2669544	2670025	Now, now.
2670045	2670865	It makes me happy.
2671045	2671265	Rob...
2672298	2677002	Microsoft could be working on that next if this whole, you know, DDR email thing falls through.
2678363	2678603	Maybe.
2678643	2679064	You know what?
2679344	2681926	You know what that whole typing of the dead setup reminds me of?
2682487	2683107	The origami.
2687833	2688233	DarkSakura.com
2716520	2718821	I got a bajillion emails in the last couple weeks.
2718881	2721063	I've tried to reply to as many as I can.
2721263	2725545	Unfortunately, I have been sort of pooped on by school, so sorry.
2726606	2729127	As in, I'm sort of skipping class tomorrow to finish my homework.
2729167	2730568	But hey, back to the mailbag.
2731528	2733069	I'm such a responsible student, aren't I?
2733709	2738992	We got an email from... Robert sent us an email.
2739893	2741754	Who had a question about Guitar Hero.
2743917	2747119	Is there any talk about Guitar Hero being made for Japan?
2747200	2755486	Sure, Red Octane is, as far as I know, an American publisher, unlike Konami, who did the Karaoke Revolution series overseas as well as domestically.
2756127	2759029	And the current song selections are very US and European.
2759409	2762832	But do you see the game competing well with Guitar Freaks?
2765490	2777377	I think most Bomani fans in general, and I'm making a broad generalization, of course there are exceptions to this, I think most of the community prefers Guitar Hero over Guitar Freaks because Guitar Hero kind of improved on the Guitar Freaks model.
2777437	2779099	So could the game do well in Japan?
2780940	2781360	Maybe.
2781980	2785583	I think they'd obviously have to change the song list, but go ahead.
2786623	2794188	I think Guitar Hero would have the potential to do well in Japan, but the thing is you have to really focus on how the Japanese gaming market does.
2794858	2798240	They're going to stick more with the Bimani series, I'm sorry.
2800141	2802082	Namco has a guitar series out.
2803823	2811467	A few other companies have various other ones, and still the most popular of them are still the Bimani ones, even if the other ones are better.
2812388	2824274	I think the most likely thing to happen, if it were to happen in Japan, and please understand this is pure speculation, I think Harmonix would probably license that out to someone else to develop a Japanese version.
2825224	2828565	or maybe, you know, like, I don't think it would be that same Red Octane Harmonix.
2828605	2832886	I think they would sell out the license, the idea, to somebody who's interested in localizing it for Japan.
2832906	2833606	Maybe the game engine.
2834206	2834426	Yeah.
2834666	2835587	I mean, who knows?
2835827	2837747	You know, that seems most likely to me.
2838167	2839647	But I don't see anything happening this year.
2839948	2842848	I would love to see, like, Guitar Hero Visual K Edition.
2843288	2846629	But what's interesting is that, you know, Guitar Freaks V is still supposedly on its way.
2846649	2850190	We haven't heard anything in a while, but supposedly it's still coming in Japan, so...
2851128	2859431	It would be interesting if Guitar Hero were to come out to counter this, but would Konami get lawsuit-y over it?
2859511	2861671	I don't know.
2862011	2863672	It's a whole other can of worms there.
2863712	2864132	Who knows?
2864452	2866813	It's all speculation.
2867113	2869794	We also have an email from our friend Rob with two Bs.
2870494	2871414	We have a lot of Robs tonight.
2871434	2873455	This is a good mailbag night.
2874582	2876423	I talked about this last week, I might add.
2877424	2877524	Okay.
2877544	2878084	I'm just saying.
2878104	2880365	I'm reading the email, which has nothing to do with last week.
2903277	2921845	But basically the Sierra game titles are being re-released from Target.com So just go ahead and check out Target.com, their whole series of them Police Quest, Space Quest, King's Quest Which will explain why they didn't get added to GameTap Oh no, Space Quest is on GameTap So I kind of was hoping King's Quest would make its way Anyway
2923541	2941048	Also an email from Justin, who I helped with the song title, said he saw the Lemmings game for PSP out and released in the UK and wondering if it was way too important and if it would even play on the US PSP.
2941088	2943929	The answer to that is no, I don't think, because aren't they...
2944557	2945578	I don't know if they're region encoded.
2945598	2946219	PSPs aren't.
2946479	2947039	No, they're not.
2947099	2949922	So actually, yeah, you would be able to play it.
2951223	2953465	I would just say, you know, check Amazon.
2953525	2956268	I order from Amazon UK all the time.
2956688	2963535	The reason why it's easier to do this with handhelds where you can cross import and all that stuff and like, you know, Game Boy Advance games work, Japan, US, doesn't matter.
2963835	2965936	is because the handhelds have their own screens.
2966017	2971940	The biggest problem you run into with the UK versus the US... Anything on TV is going to be PAL versus NTSC.
2971980	2972421	You got it.
2972501	2975343	And until everybody's on high def, we're always going to have this problem.
2976063	2981527	However, if you've got a high definition screen and the imported system, you will not run into a problem.
2983052	2987756	One thing of note on importing UMDs is that UMD movies are always region coded.
2988577	2990358	So, just as a general rule.
2990438	2995122	That's what had me thinking because I knew the movies were, I didn't know what the games were, but yeah.
2995322	2998445	But no, you should have, I suggest, honestly suggest Amazon.
2998525	3003809	I order CDs through Amazon UK and Japanese Amazon all the time.
3003930	3008313	In fact, I'm going to be paying $30 for a Gorillaz single in a couple of weeks.
3008734	3009094	Freak.
3009454	3010095	I love you.
3013760	3014241	Hey, hey.
3015203	3015964	I didn't say it on the air.
3016004	3017446	We did not bring you here to be a fanboy.
3017466	3018107	I'm just kidding.
3019029	3019590	Fanboy away.
3019630	3019930	It's fine.
3020331	3021332	Jaime emailed us.
3021974	3023756	Remember the Jaime, not me?
3023997	3025259	Yes, I do remember this.
3026240	3028204	She told us about the Darwinia?
3028786	3029847	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3047228	3051672	Though it needed good games, the golden rule of video game systems.
3052092	3056156	You guys were pretty accurate on that show, if I remember correctly, on your predictions for that system.
3056496	3061641	I was thinking about a best of show because I still have every show since you guys have been on iTunes.
3062061	3065324	And I still love to listen to some of them for a good laugh.
3065484	3065824	Thank you.
3067566	3068306	Some good ones.
3068547	3069648	OLR Week of...
3070789	3077957	8105 to 8705 with Matt, listen, I guess this is a Matt quote, Loki quote, sorry.
3078818	3083503	Listen, I'm not knocking the Mac or anything because granted the processing power may be what I'm looking for.
3083543	3084825	Their cases look cool though.
3086487	3087508	Okay, their cases are nice.
3088996	3095318	And then, Rob, did we just go to Bizarro Orange Challenge Radio because I just heard Loki say something nice about the Macintosh?
3098198	3104880	Oh, and then you said, the cases look nice, but that's all they are, just big graphing calculators inside of a nice case.
3105500	3106780	I remember him saying that.
3107241	3109121	And then bringing out the Mega Man 2 sound.
3110729	3111370	Oh, that's right.
3111430	3111910	Okay, yeah.
3112511	3112811	You know what?
3112851	3114372	There's some funny bits in the old stuff.
3115272	3122597	You can dig 20 episodes back at olrpsp.com.
3122617	3122857	What?
3123958	3125459	Oh my god, these are great!
3125539	3128601	That'll take you back to about...
3129904	3133888	November shows, but the other old stuff, you're going to have to wait until we put out a CD.
3133928	3136050	Don't we have that wiki quote page or something?
3136190	3137171	There is a wiki quote page somewhere.
3137191	3139833	You need to put these up on wiki quote, because these are hilarious.
3139873	3143617	There's one about the final thought that you did.
3144097	3144317	Yeah.
3144838	3155488	It was, we were talking about Pizza Man, and then you said, no, I said, Al, your table got GTA on my elbow.
3157213	3160754	And then you said that she got beat up by Pizza Man.
3161674	3162394	And I probably played that.
3162414	3163174	Yeah, I remember that show.
3163254	3164875	And you played the Mega Man theme.
3165515	3165855	Check it out.
3165915	3166295	Retro.
3166595	3169815	But he's winning more of our older, older, older shows.
3170295	3172876	Which, oh my god, the older shows.
3172976	3178597	Yeah, if you listen to episode one of our original live show, where Loki was talking in a tin can.
3178657	3183618	That's my horrible quote show, was the very first show when I talked about the King of Iron Fingering.
3184578	3186779	I don't know if that was the first, but it was in the beginning.
3186799	3187199	It was the first.
3187279	3190301	I left the show with such a migraine because I was using that headset.
3190321	3190701	I know.
3191321	3192201	But you know what?
3192822	3197124	Those quotes that you put up, dude, you would be our hero if you put them up on a wiki quote.
3197144	3198444	Or just put them on the forums.
3198824	3200205	We have a quote thread on our forums.
3200225	3201165	You should totally put them up there.
3201185	3201525	There you go.
3201565	3203146	It doesn't necessarily have to be the IRC.
3203586	3205047	Okay, start a new thread on there.
3205407	3206468	Show quotes thread.
3206648	3207008	There you go.
3208989	3209389	Okay.
3209609	3210049	Any other mails?
3210229	3210970	Yeah, we have a couple more, right?
3210990	3211390	Two more.
3211490	3211870	All right, let's...
3213631	3215452	This is from Sakarina.
3216173	3218734	Hi Sakarina, one of our big ol' regulars.
3218775	3221176	Hi buddy, one of our Canadian listeners.
3221717	3234126	According to posters on DSMeet, actually it's dsmeet.com slash t slash 3463, UK game retailer chain GAME is selling a third-party headset for the DS.
3234707	3242573	Apparently the headset works with mic-enabled games such as Nintendogs, and mic quality is much better than the one built in the DS.
3243647	3251632	I think UK gamers might want to pick one of these up once Metroid Prime Hunters hits the streets in May for Europeans and March for North American gamers.
3253313	3256915	That's the thing I always hated about Xbox Live.
3257375	3263119	People would be talking during full auto and stuff and I can't understand anything because I can't hear the sound effects and music.
3264560	3266761	And if only they had better mics or weren't stupid.
3268002	3269823	Not being stupid does help.
3270612	3274886	We also, the last email comes from Ace Man in Calgary.
3276189	3277330	I like our Canadian listeners.
3277630	3277990	Of course.
3278090	3278790	I love Canada.
3279431	3281712	I'm actually, I am probably taking a trip to Canada.
3281732	3282312	You know what's funny?
3282433	3285094	I'm planning on celebrating, I'm taking a vacation.
3285154	3286395	This is a me trip, not a work trip.
3286615	3287776	The last couple weeks was a work trip.
3288036	3289096	I'm going to be taking a me trip.
3289156	3290917	I'm going to celebrate 4th of July in Canada.
3291458	3292078	That's hilarious.
3292098	3294880	You're going to Canada voluntarily?
3294920	3295180	Yes.
3295580	3296220	Shut up.
3296641	3297921	I love Vancouver.
3297961	3299062	I want to go to Vancouver.
3299082	3300122	That's probably where I'm going.
3300223	3302284	I've never ever left the United States.
3303164	3307865	and it looks like my trip to London next year is getting pushed back again due to money.
3308545	3311506	So I really want to go to Canada.
3311526	3316146	We're definitely thinking about doing a 4th of July in Canada just to be ironic.
3316266	3316827	That would be hilarious.
3316847	3317567	I think it would be fun.
3318127	3318447	We'll see.
3319047	3319807	I'll let you know.
3320167	3330389	Anyway, there's a link sent to us by Aceman about Yui Bull deciding to not do any more video game movies.
3330822	3331963	and there was much rejoicing.
3332083	3332923	Yay!
3334464	3339367	And actually it's a relink to a Eurogamer article about Yui Bull basically.
3340908	3347692	It's a whole interview up there and I'll see if I can't find the link to post in our chat room and maybe repost on our website.
3348952	3356517	But basically there's a regarding the feedback that he's received from gamers to quote
3357108	3361311	The dangerous thing right now is that a lot of people bash me without thinking about the movies.
3361411	3364774	It's fashionable to hit on you, Abel, and this is what I don't get.
3365594	3368617	And I don't get why this comes so harshly from the game press.
3371719	3372760	There's another quote on here.
3373340	3378324	I won't say I won't acquire another video game license in the future, but I'm not so eager to do it anymore, to be honest.
3378832	3383695	After Far Cry, maybe I'll go away from video game based movies and everybody can be really happy about it.
3384135	3385256	Yes, we will!
3385717	3387958	Are we supposed to be sympathetic because I'm not?
3388618	3389359	I'm not at all.
3389859	3396043	Dude, he just, you know, I actually clicked on the Eurogamer article.
3396083	3396804	I love Eurogamer.
3396844	3397764	They have some of the best stuff.
3398205	3408051	But another quote on here says, If people don't see that, then it's not my problem, but I think that those people who hate me or want to bash me, normal people, people who buy movies or watch TV, they see that absolutely.
3409013	3409553	You know what?
3410794	3413977	Why don't you just actually pay attention to what the gamers are telling you?
3414457	3418120	Take it as feedback like any real professional would.
3418180	3418680	Hello?
3419181	3426466	And actually follow that feedback and put out a quality product instead of taking your own stupid little take on it because you're just screwing it up.
3427207	3428988	And that's why people are bashing you.
3429028	3433071	Maybe if people are bashing you, it's because there's a reason they're doing it.
3433877	3438361	Not necessarily because, you know, I'm sure one or two people out there are just doing it to be buttheads.
3438941	3443825	But, you know, if you're getting it from the community as a whole... The world, essentially.
3444606	3447048	Well, I'm focusing on the gaming community.
3447328	3452873	But if you're getting this feedback from the gaming community as a whole, why not listen?
3453614	3461080	You know, you're taking a series that we all, at least chunks of us, love and making a travesty of it
3462281	3464742	Why not do what they're doing with Silent Hill?
3464762	3466703	They're freaking working with Konami on this.
3467024	3468324	Here's what he has to understand.
3468384	3476468	He doesn't get it because he's getting all this people saying that the movie sucks, but he's selling millions and millions of copies on DVD or whatever.
3477308	3479069	Here's my analogy to the whole thing.
3479629	3485412	I'm under the assumption dog crap probably tastes like dog crap.
3485552	3486893	It's probably not very good.
3487665	3492888	Okay, well, we know it's bad, but I'm not going to know how bad until I actually chew on a piece of dog crap.
3493389	3495250	Same goes with Uebowl's movies.
3495650	3500073	I know they're bad, but I'm not going to subject myself to them to know how bad they really are.
3500373	3502935	I just know that they're so awful that I'm not going to watch them.
3504376	3505537	Worst analogy ever.
3507438	3510220	Actually, I think the dog crap one is fairly relevant.
3510300	3510540	Fine.
3514164	3517246	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Send us some love.
3517366	3518227	We love to get emails.
3519288	3521569	More interaction to come a little later here in the program.
3521589	3522930	But first, a couple more stories.
3522950	3528814	We are going to open Skype line very, very, very soon, but not until we get to a story from Loki about Windows.
3529895	3530896	Go Windows.
3531456	3533558	Yes, Windows will be enhanced with Origami.
3534418	3537500	Windows Vista is going to have a gamer enhanced version.
3538041	3538881	Yes, that's right.
3540002	3541043	They're going to actually have
3541929	3542149	and so on.
3564147	3564468	and so on.
3581193	3582514	GameSummerCamp.com
3610450	3611271	DarkSakura Do I?
3611351	3611791	I forgot.
3635174	3636395	No, actually, I know what it is.
3637476	3642079	Microsoft is going to start releasing a $10 best of type deal.
3643600	3644361	Isn't that cool?
3644721	3646302	Best of Platinum Hits is what they're called.
3646783	3647963	Like, the best of the best.
3648003	3648484	What games?
3648664	3649805	$10 isn't bad.
3650225	3654568	Is there good stuff in there, or am I going to be subjected to Barbie, Paradise, whatever?
3654588	3656249	There's some good stuff in here.
3656269	3661273	A lot of Tom Clancy stuff, like almost all the old ones, like Ghost Recon, blah, blah, blah.
3661293	3662354	The first Ghost Recon.
3663397	3685861	Tony Hawk's Underground, Pro Skater 4, True Crime Streets of LA, Counter Strike, Elder Scrolls 3, Enter the Matrix, that's a pretty decent one, Fusion Frenzy, Mech Assault, Project Gotham 2, Shrek 2, and the one that makes me happy is Soul Calibur 2, which I already own on several systems, but still, Soul Calibur 2, which is really cool.
3686052	3686472	That's good.
3686532	3689073	It's like one of those things like, just buy it already if you don't have it.
3689253	3696175	You know, if they were going to show a lot of love for the listeners, they would actually put out, you know, recreate the Dreamcast fishing controller so that we could do Rod Caliber.
3696295	3696796	Oh, stop it.
3698296	3699376	No, I can't.
3699777	3701197	Some of our listeners may not have heard this.
3701777	3708339	On the Dreamcast for Soul Caliber, you can take the fishing rod and play Soul Caliber with the fishing rod controller, a.k.a.
3708459	3709060	Rod Caliber.
3710060	3711861	All right.
3711941	3712161	We are...
3715689	3723331	We're going to go to the Skype line and we're going to pick up some calls here over on the Skype line.
3724371	3731273	www.orangelongerator.com Click on chat with us or interact with us and you can call us on Skype.
3731293	3743796	You can also pick up the phone and call us 916-226-9067 but please make sure you ask whoever owns the phone line first if you can call because this is a toll call unless you happen to live
3744232	3745292	in Sacramento, California.
3745352	3746952	Let's go to the line and pick up a call.
3747333	3748533	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3749353	3750493	Holy crap, I made it on.
3750753	3751653	Hi, who's this?
3751673	3752814	It's Ranma.
3752854	3753574	Who else would it be?
3753694	3754394	Hi, Ranma.
3754434	3755014	How are you?
3755714	3756454	I'm good.
3756574	3758394	This was my buddy at KatsuCon.
3758755	3764075	Ranma's the reason I went to KatsuCon and put up with six people at my panel.
3765256	3766416	No, it was great, though.
3766716	3770277	It was a good experience, and I did a lot of networking, which was really good.
3771677	3772557	It was a good time.
3773203	3773804	You gotta come back for 13.
3773844	3775405	Thinking about it.
3775585	3778308	I already told you my D.Va line.
3778588	3780490	I'll only do it if my panel's at a certain time.
3781871	3782952	Hey, I'll help you out with that.
3783032	3783753	Alright, sounds good.
3785244	3790066	Hey, I just want you to know the gifts that you sent along, I just handed out before the show.
3791586	3799189	We have our matching Mario hats as like a present, a late Christmas present, I guess, to Orange Lounge, or just a present for no real reason.
3799669	3812473	We got little Mario hats, and I have an S for Sky, a red hat, and then DarkSakura has a pink hat for Princess, DS DarkSakura, and then Loki has an L for, not Luigi, but Loki, and a green hat, and it's really cool.
3812853	3813613	So we love the hats.
3813653	3813933	Thank you.
3814605	3815566	I'm so glad you liked them.
3816566	3817707	What else is on your mind, buddy?
3818827	3819248	Not much.
3819288	3822309	I just came back from playing a couple of rounds of Drunken DDR this weekend.
3822789	3823110	Hot.
3823370	3823930	How'd that go?
3826131	3831234	The drinks weren't as strong as I thought they were, so I really couldn't get drunk per se.
3832048	3840998	You know, the only time I ever really played drunk DDR was in Vegas, and I still got, like, this is when DDR was still new, and you would always get a crowd every time you played.
3841398	3845723	And you should have seen the crowd I got playing DDR while drunk.
3845743	3849867	And I just remember, like, when you would do jumps, very heavy the jumps felt.
3850387	3851048	Very heavy.
3851569	3851729	So...
3853659	3866070	You ever notice when you're playing DDR, you turn around after two songs, you have this entire crowd behind you, and then on your next song, you just fuck up, and then you turn around, people are gone.
3866270	3868872	I know.
3868992	3870453	It's like American Idol or something.
3870473	3872495	You screw up one week, bam, you're voted off.
3873636	3874217	I know.
3874917	3875778	We're just playing DDR.
3876258	3878720	This weekend, I was the only one that could really play.
3878740	3880042	Everybody was just giving me requests.
3880702	3881663	Hey, that's cool.
3882766	3884127	and I finally checked out Strike.
3884147	3884947	It's not bad.
3885807	3887588	Oh yeah, I haven't checked it out yet.
3887628	3889209	DDR Strike, which just came out in Japan.
3889929	3891630	What's your favorite new song in Strike?
3893170	3895531	Everybody's... What's that one song?
3896031	3897552	I must have drank it more than I supposed.
3897732	3899993	I can't remember the one song I loved the most on there.
3900493	3902234	I've heard a lot of good things about the new Akira song.
3904475	3905735	I don't think I played that one.
3906356	3906636	I'm sure.
3907096	3907656	It's a good song.
3908256	3908596	Doll?
3908616	3909757	I've heard a lot of good things about Doll.
3910993	3912093	Let's Dance, David Bowie.
3912133	3912953	You know that's got to rock.
3913533	3915594	I'm so excited about that.
3915734	3916174	There it is.
3916254	3916574	All right.
3916614	3916874	There you go.
3916894	3918174	That loves me some David Bowie.
3918654	3919254	All right, Ranma.
3919274	3920175	We've got to get to other callers.
3920275	3921435	Anything else you want to share with our listeners?
3922975	3924335	When is Loki doing more fusions?
3924355	3927396	Oh, when are you doing more fusion mixes, Loki?
3927416	3927936	It's been a while.
3928676	3929796	Don't you have a thing on MySpace?
3929816	3931076	You haven't plugged that in a long time.
3931817	3933697	Yeah, but it doesn't have anything new on it, though.
3933717	3934157	No, still.
3934197	3936737	A lot of our podcast listeners probably don't even know you do these.
3937398	3939138	MySpace.com slash LokiFusion.
3940445	3941225	It's all one word, Loki.
3941265	3942565	Yeah, all one word.
3943946	3944266	I don't know.
3944406	3953668	I've been dabbling, but I haven't... The last thing I did was the not-finished version of Legend of Trance 2006 or something.
3954228	3957589	That was about the last thing I did, and I haven't really done anything since then.
3957629	3968831	I've been trying to... I've been fighting writer's block, trying to do something original for that Konami contest thing.
3970287	3972208	Thank you for watching!
3972228	3972548	See you later!
4000836	4007381	By the way, I forgot to mention, tonight on a very special edition of the Skype line, we're going to play Mention the Oscars, Get Hung Up On.
4007661	4008362	It's going to be fun.
4009383	4012625	Because the chat room is lit up with talk about the Oscars right now.
4012866	4015268	You do know that all those votes are bought, right?
4015868	4017469	And the Oscars don't mean shit.
4017589	4018991	I just want you to know, okay?
4019911	4022313	And they're getting Xbox 360s and you're not.
4023154	4023394	Probably.
4023434	4024335	Did they get Xbox 360s?
4024375	4024675	I don't know.
4024715	4027717	That's completely pure speculation pulled out of my head.
4027758	4028378	Shame on you.
4029059	4029439	Shame.
4030111	4031893	Okay, so mention the Oscars, get hung up on.
4031913	4032794	Tonight on Orange Lounge Radio.
4033335	4034477	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4038518	4044863	Hi, you there?
4044903	4046944	We're having a hard time hearing you, buddy.
4047004	4048305	So sorry, gotta let you go.
4048665	4053229	Be sure to give Echo123 a call and you can always hear what you sound like there.
4053549	4059453	Or of course, you can always try the phone number 916-226-9067, which generally has very few problems.
4059473	4060274	Let's try another call.
4060734	4061975	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4062956	4063837	Hey, how's it going?
4063937	4064797	Hi, good.
4064837	4065198	Who's this?
4066668	4067449	This is DMN.
4067649	4068349	Hi, DMN.
4068389	4069050	What's on your mind, buddy?
4070391	4074934	Well, first, I want to know if you guys have any thoughts on Tetris DS.
4075915	4087683	I cannot wait for Tetris DS because I have very fond memories of Tetris on the Game Boy, and I love that they're just redoing it, and it's going to be the whole, like, ten players locally and all that stuff.
4087703	4088423	It's going to be a good time.
4088523	4089144	Great party game.
4089464	4089824	Everybody...
4090905	4093587	Any... Tetris is like the... Anybody can play Tetris.
4093868	4094889	That's the nice thing about it.
4094929	4096550	It's such an easily accessible game.
4097471	4100653	I think it's going to make it a lot of fun and get new people on the DS and stuff.
4100954	4101995	It's going to be a good time.
4102415	4104677	Well, I tested it and I had a huge blast with it.
4105077	4106098	You tested it?
4106819	4108420	Yeah, I kind of work over at Nintendo.
4109301	4109481	Oh.
4111142	4115026	Too bad you're under NDAs or I'd be grilling you for the scoop right now.
4116970	4119652	It's worth the $30 when it comes out, I guarantee it.
4120532	4121713	Awesome, that's a great tip.
4121793	4124014	What about, I have to ask, Metroid Prime Hunters?
4124174	4126095	I'm kind of getting mixed feelings on this one.
4126115	4127315	Did you get a chance to check this out?
4128176	4130817	Well, I played the demo, I have the demo.
4131137	4135660	My impressions are that first-person shooters do not work on portables.
4135700	4137921	I played Doom on the GBA and it was terrible.
4138561	4140322	The demo was just atrocious.
4141122	4143824	I don't think it's going to do well at all.
4145041	4152625	Now, I've got to ask, since you work in the inside, and maybe this is NDA, so feel free to deflect if you must, but do you know something about the revolution that the rest of the world doesn't?
4154266	4156487	I know the same thing you do right now, which is nothing.
4156527	4158167	We haven't seen it in the department.
4158388	4158968	Interesting.
4158988	4159948	Huh.
4160489	4162209	Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners?
4162289	4163110	What's going on over there?
4164197	4167660	Well, I might as well plug my anime convention up here.
4168020	4169721	I'm the gaming manager of SakuraCon.
4169841	4171442	It's in downtown Seattle.
4171702	4172923	It's going to be a lot of fun.
4172963	4175164	It's going to be March 24th through the 26th.
4175204	4175745	Son of a gun.
4175785	4179067	Somebody's trying to get me to come up to SakuraCon.
4180488	4183169	It's one of those things where if I can get the time off work, I would go, but I don't know.
4183750	4184710	It's over a weekend, right?
4186432	4189473	Different weekend as what?
4190194	4193216	Well, I mean, it's Friday through Sunday, right?
4194642	4195803	Yeah, it's Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
4195883	4198566	You'd be totally stupid to have a con during the week, so I hope so.
4199147	4203872	Hey, tell that to the people who do Anime Expo, okay?
4203952	4206135	I don't know, I'd be down for at least a day of that.
4206195	4208798	I mean, how can I pass up SakuraCon?
4210695	4212096	We'll think of a way to get there.
4212216	4212617	I don't know.
4212697	4214458	It's going to take some clever plotting.
4214879	4216821	Seattle's not that far of a flight from here.
4216921	4220364	I'll have to open up the cosplay box and break out the bike and costume.
4220524	4221585	We'll see what we can do.
4221805	4224267	We're also venturing a new part of DDR.
4224307	4227670	We're combining DDR and a game show, so we're going to see how that works out.
4227990	4228371	Awesome.
4228471	4229071	I want to see this.
4229312	4231734	Hey, if we come up, can we get a panel or something?
4232577	4233158	or is it too late?
4233939	4240887	I think it's a little late, but I could probably see if I could swing you guys in as industry guests or something.
4241007	4241828	That would rock.
4241908	4243009	Let's talk offline.
4243049	4244511	Send us an email, okay?
4244551	4245312	Alright, no problem.
4245352	4246693	Alright, we'll see what we can do.
4246713	4247734	Alright, take care.
4247754	4247935	Bye-bye.
4251016	4252016	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4276743	4280064	and Kennewick because, well, his family lives in Prosser.
4280725	4289268	And so we've been up to Washington State before and we've been sort of thinking about looking for housing in Washington.
4289288	4290508	That's right around the corner, though.
4290548	4292649	If we want to go, we've got to book a flight like this week.
4292949	4297331	You know my husband wants me and him to move to Washington, which I've said no.
4298075	4301036	I'm going to talk to my friend in Seattle, see what we can cook up.
4301556	4302877	All right, so we'll see.
4302897	4303477	No promises.
4303937	4305338	Let's do one more call.
4305378	4307318	I'm going to go over here.
4307438	4308599	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4310840	4311140	Hello.
4311440	4312080	Hi, who's this?
4312900	4313601	Intended Maniac 64.
4313641	4315201	Hi, what's on your mind?
4317342	4318682	I'm real angry.
4318923	4320403	Orange Lounge Radio doesn't work in Winamp.
4320943	4322284	Orange Lounge Radio doesn't work in Winamp?
4322324	4322804	What's going on?
4323599	4324281	I don't know.
4324301	4327547	It keeps asking me to log in with my Live365 account.
4328369	4330193	Live365 gives us issues sometimes.
4331195	4334021	Are you letting the computer retain cookies?
4337316	4337737	You know what?
4339218	4339958	Do us a favor.
4340058	4341960	Send Live365 an email.
4342800	4346783	I wish there was more we could do on that end, but there's really unfortunately not a lot.
4347063	4353268	Believe me, though, we are aware, and every time things like this happen, it makes us not want to be there anymore.
4354148	4356410	But, you know, we're kind of stuck for right now.
4357183	4358764	Well, I'm living with Frio Player right now.
4359504	4360405	Many people don't like it.
4360845	4361285	It works.
4361926	4366328	I use iTunes sometimes, but the thing is that Winamp is the only way you can get MP3 Pro.
4366628	4369690	Little known fact, the podcast is actually encoded in MP3 Pro.
4370050	4373552	So if you listen to the podcast in Winamp with the codec, it actually sounds a lot cleaner.
4373672	4375393	So just a little thought there.
4376253	4377133	Okay, cool.
4377554	4379575	Alright, well, Nintendo Maniac, thanks for the call.
4379615	4380335	Anything else you want to share?
4382836	4385758	Unlike the last guy, I'm actually excited about Metroid Prime Hunters.
4386867	4387688	Any particular reason why?
4390790	4391691	Well... Online?
4391731	4392512	Multiplayer, maybe?
4393252	4394593	I guess, yeah.
4394634	4395754	I need another online player.
4395915	4398116	I'm just curious if that's going to be as cool as it sounds.
4398697	4399638	I'm looking forward to it, though.
4401799	4402079	Okay.
4402160	4402960	Alright, take care, buddy.
4403000	4403561	Thanks for calling.
4404261	4404481	See ya.
4404622	4404902	Later.
4405823	4407984	Alright, thank you guys so much for calling in.
4408024	4408945	We appreciate it there.
4410146	4411227	That's our Skype line.
4411307	4416191	Let's get back into the news for one last story here tonight.
4417449	4421050	Actually, first, before I get to the last story, I'll go around and see if there's any last-minute entries here.
4421390	4423951	Loki, because I think I saw you bring up something on the origami.
4423991	4425551	Is that like a last-minute addition here?
4425711	4426631	It's just a picture of it.
4427411	4431432	It's a little bit smaller than the concept video that they showed because that video was pretty old.
4432072	4436953	But still, I think I could take somebody out with this thing.
4437093	4438834	We've been giving this thing a hard time tonight.
4438974	4444075	Honestly, if I had the money to throw away on something, if I was a business person that made a lot of money,
4444568	4470301	maybe I would check this out but until we hear about some gaming stuff it's still going to be the butt of our jokes sorry yeah anyways um well first thing I gotta mention because this is like a major story we're just kind of glancing over oh sorry DS Lite actually launched in Japan oh yeah I thought you covered it's so pretty I thought you covered this on one of the mini shows yeah well I may have mentioned it but yeah DS Lite launched it's pretty it's bright it's
4471323	4472826	It's everything we had hoped for.
4473086	4474909	So yeah, that's kind of cool.
4475069	4477673	And then what else was I going to mention here?
4477733	4478795	Of course, if you like...
4480859	4481620	Geometry Wars.
4482180	4508589	There's a nice little knockoff here you can download at www.incitti.com slash blitz and they've got a nice little game you can play here that's a clone of Geometry Wars 3 and also another game called Marble Insanity which is just like Marble Madness and unfortunately that's not available for download yet but it looks really sweet with what they're doing and finally of course Rockstar announced a new game that they're making this week
4509616	4512398	Table Tennis Table Tennis Table Tennis Table Tennis Table Tennis
4532506	4535668	And as I mentioned before, Trauma Center is coming out for the revolution.
4536209	4539351	So it's according to the IGN podcast.
4539551	4541732	If you didn't get that joke, by the way, ask your mommy and daddy.
4543914	4544974	But don't tell them you heard it here.
4545054	4551319	Ubisoft announced that they're going to be releasing a new Rainbow Six game for next-gen consoles, Rainbow Six Vegas.
4552359	4556462	And this has actually come from the brand-new issue of EGM.
4556902	4558864	So it looks pretty sweet so far.
4560285	4560545	And...
4562102	4571385	Also, Bungie says that I Love Bees 2 is fake.
4571585	4576946	I hate viral marketing because viral marketing is not viral anymore.
4577166	4578107	It's just no one cares.
4578167	4578607	It's trendy.
4579527	4580067	It's stupid.
4580187	4584508	It's like before, you know, people didn't know what they were advertising.
4584628	4586929	It was just something that's like, whoa, what is this, you know?
4587349	4588930	And you try to figure out more information.
4588990	4589870	Like the whole thing with...
4591121	4594923	I wonder if that could be an announcement for the Splinter Cell for the 360 or whatever, it's just retarded.
4616735	4617516	Just my rant there.
4617696	4618797	All right.
4618917	4620779	DarkSakura, you have any last stories for us?
4621219	4621940	Just out of curiosity?
4622260	4623421	Anything you've been holding out on?
4624102	4624722	Just wanted to check.
4625563	4627085	I will continue to keep my secrets.
4627545	4627845	All right.
4628566	4630087	Well, here, I have something that might interest you.
4630127	4633851	This seems like something you'd get a kick out of because it's Sega-related, and we know you're a Sega fangirl.
4633891	4634191	Here it is.
4634732	4637474	And this is a story that ran on Joystick earlier this week.
4637754	4640377	Did you know that there was a Penn & Teller Sega CD game?
4642359	4642559	It was...
4643178	4643879	I didn't know that.
4643959	4646540	It was Penn & Teller Smoke & Mirrors is what it was called.
4646580	4649502	It was never released actually, which is why you've probably never heard of it.
4649542	4657707	But get this, there actually is a torrent out there now floating on the internet so you can download it, burn it, and just load it up in the Sega CD.
4659443	4663226	There's actually a part in this game that the article talks about called the Desert Bus Minigame.
4663587	4664808	You drive a bus in the desert.
4665088	4667550	Your goal is to go from Tucson, Arizona to Las Vegas.
4667890	4673515	Your bus never goes more than 45 miles an hour, so the trip takes approximately 8 hours in real time to make.
4673875	4678019	There's no scenery or even other cars on the road, just plain desert for 8 hours.
4678599	4683343	Oh, and your bus veers to the right just slightly, so it's impossible to just tape down a button and go do something else.
4683783	4686826	Rumor has it that if you make it to Vegas, you score one point.
4687409	4688310	Sounds awesome.
4688390	4689310	Can't wait to play it.
4691631	4692332	Never released.
4692372	4693072	Imagine that.
4693252	4695853	I have one more story, but it's quite funny.
4698195	4699275	I wanted the last story.
4701076	4707839	French developer Cyanide has launched their online home of their forthcoming action RPG, Loki.
4709200	4711321	You ass.
4711401	4714483	There's not a whole lot of content on the site at the moment.
4714883	4716564	Just a forum and some screenshots.
4718018	4720760	But my guess is going to be it's based around my life.
4721820	4722360	Oh, shut up.
4722400	4723521	As exciting as it is.
4723661	4724302	Trolls and all.
4724522	4724682	No.
4725102	4728504	But I just had to point that out because, you know, it's funny.
4729344	4729745	All right.
4730365	4733006	On that egotistical note, it's time to end the show.
4733547	4737229	Our special guest, Spike, our buddy Spike, thank you so much for being here tonight.
4737949	4738830	Thank you for having me.
4739390	4745433	And laughing at our jokes, which makes us feel good, and praising the almighty Dark Sakura, I noticed, at certain points there during the show.
4745513	4746494	Make my ego grow.
4748098	4748718	She's awesome.
4748778	4749659	Just add Wata.
4750359	4753360	Actually, I'm really excited now to go download this Penn & Teller game.
4754060	4755161	Let me know how the bus driving goes.
4755781	4756881	Any final thoughts for our listeners?
4759202	4760223	Quiz and Dragons?
4761503	4761923	Look, buddy.
4763324	4764064	That's a challenge.
4764224	4765325	You're issuing a challenge here.
4765785	4767325	All right, Loki, your final thought.
4770146	4772727	Yeah, I can't wait to play some new games this week.
4773648	4774208	Burnout and...
4775217	4779399	I guess Burnout's not exactly a new game, but I don't know.
4780360	4781741	I look forward to playing Burnout again.
4782881	4785683	My final thought is the Oscars are a sham.
4786243	4792106	Why don't you just go watch a movie that looks interesting and not that somebody told you to watch or told you that was good?
4792446	4794007	Make up your own mind.
4794627	4797769	They pay millions of dollars for those ads and variety.
4798349	4799210	It's a sham.
4800310	4801091	Go outside.
4802554	4803714	Support independent films too.
4804054	4805715	You can watch a big blockbuster once in a while.
4805735	4808696	Don't forget to go to your local art house cinema because you might be missing something good.
4808756	4809756	DarkSakura, your final thought.
4810176	4811017	Reject false icons.
4811577	4811837	All right.
4812317	4817819	From us here at Orange Lounge Radio to all of you, thanks so much for joining us back here after our little break.
