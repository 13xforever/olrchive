VD. Anyway my name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Sky. Joining me as always

01:11.920 --> 01:13.240
say hello to the one and only

01:13.240 --> 01:16.360
Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers. How you doing?

01:16.360 --> 01:21.600
What's frustrating? You were in such a good mood just like two minutes ago.

01:21.600 --> 01:24.840
I wasn't in a good mood because your mocha attacked me.

01:24.840 --> 01:26.080
I do appreciate the...

01:26.080 --> 01:29.760
I'm chocolaty good, dammit.

01:29.760 --> 01:32.600
Well now you smell like chocolate, so...

01:32.600 --> 01:35.980
I smelled like cherries before, I'd rather.

01:35.980 --> 01:40.780
You know, chocolate covered cherries is a delicacy in some places.

01:40.780 --> 01:42.920
Say hello also to Tech Master Loki.

01:42.920 --> 01:43.920
Hi.

01:43.920 --> 01:44.920
How you doing?

01:44.920 --> 01:45.920
I'm doing great.

01:45.920 --> 01:46.920
Alright.

01:46.920 --> 01:47.920
Sounds good.

01:47.920 --> 01:51.080
Once in a while we'd like to invite somebody special to come on the show.

01:51.080 --> 01:53.760
Say hello to our local buddy, Bugd.

01:53.760 --> 01:55.940
I'm just special now?

01:55.940 --> 01:56.940
You're very special.

01:56.940 --> 01:57.940
Okay.

01:57.940 --> 01:58.940
Bugd has known me for how long?

01:58.940 --> 01:59.940
How long have you known me, Bugd?

01:59.940 --> 02:00.940
I can't admit this.

02:00.940 --> 02:01.940
What?

02:01.940 --> 02:02.940
No, I can't.

02:02.940 --> 02:03.940
Why?

02:03.940 --> 02:04.940
I just can't.

02:04.940 --> 02:05.940
Well, then I'll say it.

02:05.940 --> 02:06.940
It's probably been at least...

02:06.940 --> 02:07.940
Seventeen.

02:07.940 --> 02:08.940
Seventeen years?

02:08.940 --> 02:09.940
You're kidding.

02:09.940 --> 02:10.940
Oh, my gosh.

02:10.940 --> 02:11.940
No, I guess it has been ten years since high school.

02:11.940 --> 02:12.940
That's why I didn't want to admit it.

02:12.940 --> 02:13.940
Oh, my God.

02:13.940 --> 02:14.940
See?

02:14.940 --> 02:15.940
Exactly.

02:15.940 --> 02:18.400
Some of our listeners are 17, even younger than that.

02:18.400 --> 02:19.400
Oh, my gosh.

02:19.400 --> 02:20.400
All right.

02:20.400 --> 02:27.920
All right, well here we are another week talk about those games that we love and adore especially games that don't suck

02:27.920 --> 02:28.680
But you know once in a while

02:28.680 --> 02:31.720
We got to tell you about the ones that do just to tell you to stay away from them

02:31.760 --> 02:37.840
Let's get into it as we start off every week with a little bit of how is your gaming week a chance for us?

02:37.840 --> 02:39.840
To tell you what's going on in our gaming world

02:40.060 --> 02:43.140
Because we're gamers just like you Dark Sakura. What do you been playing this week?

02:43.140 --> 02:46.740
Not much of anything because my week has been really

02:46.740 --> 02:50.220
you know busy with me dropping school and stuff.

02:50.220 --> 02:53.620
I quit school to play video games.

02:53.620 --> 02:57.900
Way to set an example for those seventeen-year-olds listening. I dropped a class due to

02:57.900 --> 03:01.500
time constraints, I've played Animal Crossing and Puzzle Fighter.

03:01.500 --> 03:05.660
Puzzle Fighter, now that's an oldie but goodie. And we've had some

03:05.660 --> 03:09.580
burnout going on in the house and I've been avoiding it like the plague. Why?

03:09.580 --> 03:12.700
Because that game gives me a headache. Oh, because all the motion and stuff?

03:12.700 --> 03:18.120
that's right I'm you know it because of the really loudness that Dan has our TV

03:18.120 --> 03:18.940
turned up to

03:18.940 --> 03:23.580
it's funny you bring a puzzle fighter in college because in college that is a lot

03:23.580 --> 03:26.400
of what I did is play puzzle fighter me my old roommate used to play that

03:26.400 --> 03:29.940
a lot like it was scary how much we play puzzle fighter a lot

03:29.940 --> 03:34.780
okay now I'm having like another bike that made me twitch because it just made

03:34.780 --> 03:36.700
me realize that yes I am older than you are

03:36.700 --> 03:39.980
because not by much what I was playing in college was

03:39.980 --> 03:43.420
The Saturn had just come out and my friend imported one

03:43.420 --> 03:47.260
and we were playing Gundam. It makes you feel better. That was like... KOF 95

03:47.260 --> 03:51.080
and I had a Playstation in my room and we were playing Toshinden all the time.

03:51.080 --> 03:55.820
If it makes you feel better this was like my junior year. My freshman year was

03:55.820 --> 03:58.680
all about Super Mario Kart because I was the only kid in the dorm with the Super

03:58.680 --> 03:59.240
Nintendo.

03:59.240 --> 04:03.140
I had a Super Nintendo and by the way you're making me cry because of next month.

04:03.140 --> 04:06.220
You're also one of the few that were sober.

04:06.220 --> 04:09.540
My birthday is next month. That's right but you're having a big birthday

04:09.540 --> 04:17.120
extravaganza right can't wait I get so drunk I forget it's my birthday and this

04:17.120 --> 04:20.880
year this year you might need that but don't we still love you age is just a

04:20.880 --> 04:27.880
number yeah all right Loki how's your gaming week been good been playing both

04:27.880 --> 04:34.940
the new burnout well not quite new burnout new to the Xbox 360 burnout and

04:34.940 --> 04:41.080
Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter. Burnout hasn't really changed they made it a lot

04:41.080 --> 04:47.380
blurrier and I guess higher resolution textures but everything's so blurry and

04:47.380 --> 04:52.340
dark it's I don't know it's tough sometimes finding out where you're going

04:52.340 --> 04:57.220
headache inducing not headache inducing but just you know trying to see down

04:57.220 --> 05:01.860
like a tunnel where driving 200 miles an hour and everything's like like I got

05:01.860 --> 05:06.480
cataracts or something. It's just not good. I don't like what they're doing with these

05:06.480 --> 05:11.640
games where they're putting this like halo effect on everything. So to hide the fact

05:11.640 --> 05:15.040
that the textures aren't quite as good as they should be and the edges aren't quite

05:15.040 --> 05:21.240
as smooth as they should be. Listen, we know that the case is that these textures aren't

05:21.240 --> 05:24.640
as good or the graphics aren't as good. You don't need to try to hide it by making everything

05:24.640 --> 05:31.640
blurry. Don't pull a Nintendo 64. Now I'm curious, how does a game like Burnout compare

05:31.640 --> 05:36.480
to full auto because to me, and let's keep in mind I don't usually play a whole lot

05:36.480 --> 05:41.880
of racing games, to me they're both cars plus destruction equals fun.

05:41.880 --> 05:45.480
So is one superior to the other?

05:45.480 --> 05:46.480
What's the deal?

05:46.480 --> 05:51.720
Burnout is more racing, whereas full auto is more blowing stuff up, because they have,

05:51.720 --> 05:55.160
granted they do have crash mode in burnout, but...

05:55.160 --> 05:56.160
Burnout lacks weapons.

05:56.160 --> 05:59.800
Yeah, you don't have weapons, and also for some reason the burnout in the 360 is a lot

05:59.800 --> 06:03.840
harder than I remember being on the Playstation 2.

06:03.840 --> 06:07.160
Like you smash in the cars and they just do not want to crash.

06:07.160 --> 06:10.640
It's really, you know, the AI is a lot harder this time.

06:10.640 --> 06:14.600
Which I guess is good, but you know, the crash junctions are still fun and stuff.

06:14.600 --> 06:18.940
The graphics are a little bit better, the car models are more detailed so you see more

06:18.940 --> 06:23.040
damage being done to them, but it's not like, ooh, this is a brand new game.

06:23.040 --> 06:27.360
I'm waiting for the next Burnout to come out, and that'll be good.

06:27.360 --> 06:35.560
I'm willing to take donations of Xbox 360s, Burnout, and FlatOut to make all these, whatever

06:35.560 --> 06:38.060
the hell the thing is called, FlatOut sucked.

06:38.060 --> 06:39.060
It just FlatOut sucked.

06:39.060 --> 06:41.920
FlatOut 2 is coming out soon as well.

06:41.920 --> 06:44.240
Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter.

06:44.240 --> 06:45.240
What can I say about that?

06:45.240 --> 06:46.760
The game is beautiful.

06:46.760 --> 06:49.000
That is just amazing.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.800
This is probably one of the killer apps for the 360.

06:52.800 --> 06:57.000
The only problem is the learning curve is incredibly high.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.620
For example, I have never played a Ghost Recon game in my life and I tried this today.

07:01.620 --> 07:07.700
Now granted it's very pretty and stuff and I kind of got the handle of how to work things,

07:07.700 --> 07:12.060
but actually throwing me down into missions is about as effective as throwing me down

07:12.060 --> 07:16.060
into a mission in Call of Duty 2 on veteran mode.

07:16.060 --> 07:23.100
Basically it's like walking into the Iraq war without any training and hoping to survive.

07:23.100 --> 07:24.820
It's just not, I don't know.

07:24.820 --> 07:25.820
It could be fun.

07:25.820 --> 07:31.380
really need to like get better at it but the game itself looks amazing just the whole story

07:31.380 --> 07:37.720
part where you're flying over Mexico City it looks it's just wow it's really good.

07:37.720 --> 07:41.380
And then on top of that of course I've been playing Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories

07:41.380 --> 07:46.560
I'm very excited that they're gonna be releasing a new Grand Theft Auto on the PSP soon and

07:46.560 --> 07:50.360
Liberty City Stories is supposed to be coming out on the Playstation 2 at the end of April

07:50.360 --> 07:55.560
So that should be interesting, hopefully we'll have online multiplayer with that.

07:55.560 --> 07:59.040
But yeah, right now just kind of starting to finally get back into my winning streaks

07:59.040 --> 08:03.000
again and kicking lots of ass.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
So it's fun.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.160
How's online in Burnout?

08:06.160 --> 08:08.520
I haven't played online in Burnout yet.

08:08.520 --> 08:09.520
Full auto though.

08:09.520 --> 08:12.720
I was playing full auto this weekend, playing online in full auto and I have some major

08:12.720 --> 08:14.460
complaints about it.

08:14.460 --> 08:18.540
Not all the races count because of this weird glitch that's in the game.

08:18.540 --> 08:23.380
I've played races upon races, like 10 different races, and I look back at my leaderboard and

08:23.380 --> 08:27.300
see how many points I have, and the same amount of points, even though I came in first in

08:27.300 --> 08:32.300
these races, and it says the number of races hasn't gone up, so nothing's counting.

08:32.300 --> 08:34.540
So I'm wasting my damn time on this stupid thing.

08:34.540 --> 08:36.980
Isn't that because people are dropping before the race is actually finished?

08:36.980 --> 08:41.020
I don't know what the case is, but there is a big problem with people dropping out of

08:41.020 --> 08:43.560
the races in this game.

08:43.560 --> 08:44.560
It's really bad.

08:44.560 --> 08:47.060
You know, half the players drop out at the very end.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.880
ever leave them negative feedback because I have a problem people like

08:49.880 --> 08:54.240
randomly boot me from games and marble blast and it's not like I'm any good so

08:54.240 --> 08:56.440
I don't know why they're booting me from the game I don't even have a headset so

08:56.440 --> 09:00.140
it's not like I can trash talk them but they boot me from the game so I'd leave

09:00.140 --> 09:03.480
them negative feedback when they do that well a lot of time it's hard for me

09:03.480 --> 09:06.400
remember who's you know dropped out of the game because you know they're not

09:06.400 --> 09:10.760
gonna appear at the very end or I don't know it's just I'm trying to get the

09:10.760 --> 09:14.720
last few achievements in full auto and those are the online ones and I'm up to

09:14.720 --> 09:19.040
rank 8 right now. So I only have two more to go, but it's really hard when it's not

09:19.040 --> 09:22.820
counting half the races that you're playing. I can be playing it for three hours and only

09:22.820 --> 09:27.680
count two races. I mean, it's just a waste of time. And they really need to fix this

09:27.680 --> 09:33.340
kind of stuff. We'll get into this later about how these games are coming out really glitchy

09:33.340 --> 09:37.620
and buggy and they're just letting it go to market real quick. Because they can fix it

09:37.620 --> 09:42.520
later by patching it. That's just a poor excuse of programming.

09:42.520 --> 09:51.420
else? Bug, anything in your gaming week? No, actually I started up Diablo II again. I started

09:51.420 --> 09:57.520
up Diablo II again, and I've been bringing up old characters that I've found laying around

09:57.520 --> 10:04.040
on other old CDs. Is there still a big online community for Diablo II? I don't care. You

10:04.040 --> 10:09.840
don't play online? No. Sometimes I'll play with other local people, set up Hamachi to

10:09.840 --> 10:14.160
do local network sort of thing because with Hamachi you can just basically

10:14.160 --> 10:19.280
everybody it looks like everybody's on the same network hmm I I yeah I haven't

10:19.280 --> 10:22.800
touched Diablo 2 and probably like years but I have you ever played World of

10:22.800 --> 10:26.800
Warcraft no I'm kind of surprised because it to me there's a lot of

10:26.800 --> 10:32.360
similarities. I don't play subscription games. I know. That whole lack of funding. Okay have you ever thought about

10:32.360 --> 10:36.320
Guild Wars? No. Because Guild Wars isn't subscription based and yeah but it's not

10:36.320 --> 10:42.060
World of Warcraft but it's almost it's got a lot of the same elements I mean it

10:42.060 --> 10:47.960
isn't but you know there's the look and feel is very similar to me anyway yeah

10:47.960 --> 10:51.260
all right I'll stick to Blizzard all right anything else definitely no

10:51.260 --> 10:55.580
fucking Final Fantasy shit you know what's funny about Final Fantasy yeah I

10:55.580 --> 10:58.820
know you two are going back into it Shane's trying to get me back into Final

10:58.820 --> 11:03.320
Fantasy 11 and I think I'm gonna do it addict we're gonna we're gonna start

11:03.320 --> 11:07.960
over on a new server. Actually though, you going back to that actually reminds me I did

11:07.960 --> 11:12.480
do something else gaming related. Oh? I'm uh, downloading Ragnarok Online again. Oh

11:12.480 --> 11:17.520
god. Addict. I'm going to be playing Ragnarok Online on a private server. Isn't that sad

11:17.520 --> 11:21.600
that we've all gone back to the crack games that we used to play? I can't go back to World

11:21.600 --> 11:27.160
of Warcraft until after I get finances sold, so like, well crap. I need gaming crack. You

11:27.160 --> 11:31.880
know, I'm actually still paying for PSO Blue Burst and I forgot. Ooh, cancel that crap.

11:31.880 --> 11:37.920
Do you know how long I was paying for PSO on Xbox and wasn't even using it?

11:37.920 --> 11:41.240
Sad. So you have to pay for

11:41.240 --> 11:45.160
live plus PSO? On the old Xbox, yes.

11:45.160 --> 11:48.560
Unless you're Julie.

11:48.560 --> 11:52.040
She hasn't had to. They haven't built her.

11:52.040 --> 11:56.240
Thanks to the new setup on Xbox 360, I think games like Final Fantasy XI that won't

11:56.240 --> 11:56.680
apply.

11:56.680 --> 11:59.840
Because you know there's the whole Xbox Live Silver and Xbox Live Gold.

11:59.840 --> 12:03.760
Well, you don't pay for silver. Silver comes with your Xbox 360

12:03.760 --> 12:07.700
and silver is enough to, you know, get your account, your basics, and see who's

12:07.700 --> 12:10.400
online and stuff, but you can't actually play games against people.

12:10.400 --> 12:15.880
But silver is all you need to connect to play online and then you pay Sony to do

12:15.880 --> 12:18.960
It's just like Windows XP. In a way.

12:18.960 --> 12:22.080
Yeah, you can get online but you can't do shit until you actually buy the real stuff.

12:22.080 --> 12:25.040
I think we're gonna see a lot of connectivity between

12:25.040 --> 12:28.120
Windows Vista especially and the Xbox 360.

12:28.120 --> 12:31.920
I think it's just very natural that Microsoft is going to try and interlink all that

12:31.920 --> 12:35.880
best we can. Of course, absolutely. Well, they're already trying to link the

12:35.880 --> 12:39.880
Media Center Edition 2005 because all the ads for like the Gateway

12:39.880 --> 12:43.720
machines coming out with that are listing. If you look at the bottom it says

12:43.720 --> 12:45.320
compatible with Xbox 360.

12:45.320 --> 12:49.120
Well, you know I saw some link on the internet somewhere where you can link your Mac

12:49.120 --> 12:50.680
to the Xbox 360 now. Yeah, connect 360.

12:50.680 --> 12:54.080
Yeah, something like that. So I was going to check that out for my new little lappy

12:54.080 --> 12:58.720
Laptop Mr. iBook. But yeah, I'm probably gonna get back into Final Fantasy 11. At least,

12:58.720 --> 13:03.320
I'm gonna try it and see if I can rediscover my love for the game, because

13:03.320 --> 13:05.640
you know I left the game because the guild selling thing got out of control

13:05.640 --> 13:07.840
and they banned all those people, so

13:07.840 --> 13:11.760
I'm gonna give it another shot. We're gonna try... I am really curious about

13:11.760 --> 13:14.920
this expansion that's coming out for Final Fantasy 11, The Treasures of Odd Oregon,

13:14.920 --> 13:17.720
especially because now they have the puppet master class, which looks pretty

13:17.720 --> 13:19.560
cool. They just added this week, announced

13:19.560 --> 13:23.080
Blue Mage, and Shane's really excited about being a pirate.

13:23.080 --> 13:26.520
So, uh, he's trying to convince me to get back into it.

13:26.520 --> 13:30.580
Or Corsair, sorry. He's trying to convince me to get back into it, and I'm like, oh, okay.

13:30.580 --> 13:31.480
What?

13:31.480 --> 13:32.880
Buck Pirate, Rectal Buccaneer.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.080
Shut up.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.080
Anything else?

13:35.080 --> 13:38.180
Alright, uh, let's see, my gaming week.

13:38.180 --> 13:42.480
Um, I've been playing a little bit of Xbox 360, uh, Loki loaned me some games.

13:42.480 --> 13:45.980
I was playing Perfect Dark Zero, which I just, I'm sorry, I couldn't get into it.

13:45.980 --> 13:49.680
I see why people really enjoy this game. I mean, as far as first-person shooters go,

13:49.680 --> 13:51.380
it is pretty intricate and a lot of fun.

13:51.380 --> 13:55.940
But for me, no, it wasn't doing it for me so I don't think I'm really gonna play

13:55.940 --> 13:56.820
through it much more.

13:56.820 --> 14:01.620
Ridge Racer 6, pretty cool, pretty cool. I suck at it,

14:01.620 --> 14:06.500
but it's really pretty looking. For me, see, I enjoy the destruction when

14:06.500 --> 14:07.660
it comes to car games. I love

14:07.660 --> 14:11.420
me some destruction, so I think I'm gonna be back to full auto and burnout.

14:11.420 --> 14:14.580
But Ridge Racer was kinda fun, and I guess there's a demo on

14:14.580 --> 14:17.860
360 now if you want to check this out. Yeah, there's a demo on Xbox Live. Very cool.

14:17.860 --> 14:22.540
And one game I got back into it was a game I bought when I finally got my

14:22.540 --> 14:24.320
Xbox 360 but never really played a lot of,

14:24.320 --> 14:29.500
Cameo. And I'm starting to like this game a little more than when I first played it

14:29.500 --> 14:30.100
because

14:30.100 --> 14:34.340
the first time I played it, it was all like really overwhelming to me, like that

14:34.340 --> 14:36.160
first level that you have to go through.

14:36.160 --> 14:40.260
But once you beat that level, like there's a story event that happens that

14:40.260 --> 14:40.820
kinda

14:40.820 --> 14:45.540
makes you start again from scratch, and so I felt that was kinda a better way to

14:45.540 --> 14:49.080
kind of start the game for me was kind of learning everything from scratch you

14:49.080 --> 14:51.700
know what I mean it was easier for me to get into when it why wasn't like

14:51.700 --> 14:54.980
overwhelmed with everything at once but to the game's credit it's got a pretty

14:54.980 --> 14:59.900
good help system in it like you can always ask your little like it's just

14:59.900 --> 15:02.600
like in Zelda you know how that fairy follows you and you can always ask the

15:02.600 --> 15:06.540
fairy for help well in this one it's a little dude that's like in the book and

15:06.540 --> 15:10.460
you can always ask the book for help so you know it helps idiots only find their

15:10.460 --> 15:15.300
way through partners in time oh I'm sure a lot a lot of games adapt the same idea

15:15.300 --> 15:21.860
now so and so I'm enjoying that game and just other stuff on xbox live arcade I

15:21.860 --> 15:25.300
have probably downloaded damn near every game they offer on xbox live arcade it's

15:25.300 --> 15:28.580
kind of sad not everything I didn't get back em in her heart saying that crap

15:28.580 --> 15:33.540
but I did get I got bejeweled why did I buy pitch why I don't know why I just I

15:33.540 --> 15:37.300
were I know cuz I'm a sucker and I wanted to play it in pretty pretty HD

15:37.300 --> 15:41.340
and maybe get cuz I I I wanted to see if I get some more achievement points but

15:41.340 --> 15:44.580
here's the thing but jeweled has harder achievement points and like any game

15:44.580 --> 15:50.640
I've seen on Xbox Live Arcade seriously you have to be a bejeweled master to get achievement points in that game

15:50.640 --> 15:57.120
It's sick the best bet for achievement points, and I was reading they actually have this article. That's on GameSpot right now

15:57.160 --> 16:05.340
It's how to score 6,000 easy achievement points, and it's sports games or where you get the freaking easy ass points

16:05.700 --> 16:07.560
Yeah, yeah

16:07.560 --> 16:13.460
I'm going to a chat room www.orinslawandtrader.com click on chat reading some feedback here in the chat room

16:13.460 --> 16:18.560
let's see GK 128 says cameo is terrible

16:18.560 --> 16:21.380
I don't know if I'd call it terrible is

16:21.380 --> 16:24.400
it is it as good as Zelda hell no is it

16:24.400 --> 16:26.920
even as good as fable probably not but

16:26.920 --> 16:28.700
is it entertaining for me for a little

16:28.700 --> 16:31.840
while yes is it worth 60 bucks no it's

16:31.840 --> 16:34.100
not $60 it's 50 now right it was always

16:34.100 --> 16:35.960
50 yeah was it okay yeah I really like

16:35.960 --> 16:37.400
that people say something is terrible

16:37.400 --> 16:39.380
without stating why well you know I'm

16:39.380 --> 16:41.840
sure it's a terrible game because the

16:41.840 --> 16:47.020
The story line is retarded and I don't like the game and it's too happy.

16:47.020 --> 16:48.420
Why is the story line retarded?

16:48.420 --> 16:52.920
The story line is retarded because it revolves around this stupid fairy that freaking kidnaps

16:52.920 --> 16:56.880
your parents or whatever and you have to use these gems.

16:56.880 --> 16:58.520
That just illustrates something to me.

16:58.520 --> 16:59.520
What?

16:59.520 --> 17:04.640
That when people say, oh this sucks, say specifically why so that people have some idea what you're

17:04.640 --> 17:05.640
talking about.

17:05.640 --> 17:08.200
You know what, some of the dialogue in the game is a little lame.

17:08.200 --> 17:12.920
Like they have these real lame jokes, like the old guy in the book and the little witch

17:12.920 --> 17:15.880
with one eye or whatever have this little back and forth thing going on.

17:15.880 --> 17:18.160
But it's really like canned humor.

17:18.160 --> 17:20.880
It's like canned sitcom laughter type jokes.

17:20.880 --> 17:21.980
It's pretty bad.

17:21.980 --> 17:28.040
So honestly you put a game like Cameo next to a Zelda or next to a better type of adventure

17:28.040 --> 17:31.000
game and it is kind of sad.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.920
But you have to remember it's a launch title.

17:32.920 --> 17:36.760
And launch titles usually, unless you're Nintendo, aren't your best games.

17:36.760 --> 17:43.260
You know, one of my favorite games ever that was a launch title was Jumping Flash on PlayStation.

17:43.260 --> 17:44.760
Oh, I don't even remember that.

17:44.760 --> 17:48.760
It's a little mechanical rabbit, and I played the hell out of the demo.

17:48.760 --> 17:53.760
Well, here's the thing about Cameo. Cameo is more like Spyro than it is like Zelda.

17:53.760 --> 17:57.760
They were trying to position it to be like a Zelda killer, and no.

17:57.760 --> 18:01.760
Well, isn't it more like the Banjo-Kazooie or Banjo-Tooie or whatever?

18:01.760 --> 18:02.760
Exactly, yeah.

18:02.760 --> 18:06.360
Which was just made to exist not necessarily be good

18:07.600 --> 18:12.720
Well, the one thing that they need to keep in mind is that when you're trying to come up with a game that's gonna go

18:12.900 --> 18:14.900
against the big names they

18:15.520 --> 18:21.720
Not only do they have quality to worry about they also have reputation to worry about and I'm sorry

18:21.720 --> 18:25.960
Nothing's gonna really dethrone the Zelda franchise the Final Fantasy franchise

18:26.920 --> 18:28.520
fantasy star

18:28.520 --> 18:30.120
besides itself

18:30.120 --> 18:35.180
There was actually I was reading in the chairman before the show started a lot of hate going around for Final Fantasy crystal chronicles

18:35.320 --> 18:40.440
which you know was a radical departure from the Final Fantasy franchise and you know kind of I

18:41.040 --> 18:47.400
Don't think the GameCube was the best system for that game. It's human nature for to just hate on whatever is different

18:47.400 --> 18:52.240
I don't think anything with Final Fantasy and the word crystal and it should be ever, you know

18:52.900 --> 18:56.200
Made available because or mystic in the title

18:56.200 --> 18:58.200
Yeah, I'm thinking about Mystic Quest.

18:58.200 --> 19:00.200
Any quest in the title of a Final Fantasy game?

19:00.200 --> 19:04.200
Didn't they call Final Fantasy Mystic Quest in Japan Final Fantasy USA?

19:04.200 --> 19:08.200
Because that just, I could've sworn I read that somewhere and I'm like, that just makes us look bad.

19:08.200 --> 19:13.200
I tried playing, well, then again, our Super Mario 2 was out over there, Super Mario USA.

19:13.200 --> 19:17.200
But it had already existed over there in, what, Doki Doki Panic, right?

19:17.200 --> 19:18.200
Yeah.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.200
But differently, you know.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.200
But it wasn't Mario.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.200
Yeah.

19:21.200 --> 19:24.200
It's amazing what a little Italian plumber can do for your game, huh?

19:24.200 --> 19:31.080
But also keep in mind that a lot of times when we get the RPGs over here, they repackage

19:31.080 --> 19:36.440
it for Japan as the international version because it's got more stuff in it.

19:36.440 --> 19:39.880
Square does that an awful lot, I think about 10 and all that stuff, yeah, absolutely.

19:39.880 --> 19:43.080
Alright, let's get into some gaming news.

19:43.080 --> 19:45.680
That's what we're here to do, let you guys know what's going on in the gaming world and

19:45.680 --> 19:46.680
bitch about it.

19:46.680 --> 19:48.520
Loki, we're going to start off with you tonight.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.840
Here's something some PSP owners might bitch about.

19:50.840 --> 19:51.840
What do you think?

19:51.840 --> 19:53.360
They redesigned the PSP.

19:53.360 --> 19:58.200
Not surprising, actually it's something we've been talking about for weeks now.

19:58.200 --> 20:04.440
And it's just kind of, you know, I don't know, not very surprising.

20:04.440 --> 20:06.040
Basically this comes from Any Cool News.

20:06.040 --> 20:11.320
It's this guy, Joseph Merrick, who's saying that he's got the insider information about

20:11.320 --> 20:17.120
their new PSP system, including that it's going to be a more sleeker, slimmed down version

20:17.120 --> 20:24.200
of the PSP, including a 4GB flash drive and a digital camera.

20:24.200 --> 20:25.940
No word on what the price is going to be.

20:25.940 --> 20:27.240
How Nintendo of them is all I can think of.

20:27.240 --> 20:31.820
But it's supposed to be released around Christmas.

20:31.820 --> 20:36.120
Is this Sony doing a knee-jerk reaction to the insanity of the DS Lite in Japan?

20:36.120 --> 20:45.000
I think so, but here's the thing about the PSP, I don't see, unless you're pirating

20:45.000 --> 20:50.560
games to the memory stick. I don't know why you would need more than a gig. I mean, unless

20:50.560 --> 20:53.680
you're dumping a lot of stuff on there. Four gigs. They're trying to make it...

20:53.680 --> 20:57.180
Well wait, if it comes with a digital camera, then they're trying, you know, it's going

20:57.180 --> 21:00.740
to be a camera device too. Well I hope the camera doesn't suck. What

21:00.740 --> 21:05.640
actually I heard there was like a cell phone camera that they had in their Sony Ericsson

21:05.640 --> 21:08.320
camera is what they're being used, going to use for it.

21:08.320 --> 21:11.480
Which will be VGA. The problem, the problem though with the camera

21:11.480 --> 21:16.800
initially when they were showing it off, I guess, was that the camera was where the PSP

21:16.800 --> 21:18.520
logo is right now.

21:18.520 --> 21:24.400
In other words, it's facing the user, so it would be used as like a webcam.

21:24.400 --> 21:25.800
We're watching you.

21:25.800 --> 21:31.040
Which is kind of stupid, but obviously I'm sure that's going to be fixed later on.

21:31.040 --> 21:33.360
I don't see the real need for this.

21:33.360 --> 21:38.080
I mean, a 4 gig hard drive in there as well.

21:38.080 --> 21:39.440
Is it going to be a hard drive or flash?

21:39.440 --> 21:40.440
Flash.

21:40.440 --> 21:46.360
probably a micro drive or something like that micro drive is hard drive well whatever it's nan flash

21:46.360 --> 21:51.560
drive there okay okay that makes more sense because adding another rotating media just sucks more

21:51.560 --> 21:58.600
battery life exactly so i don't know it's interesting it's supposed to come out you know sometime

21:58.600 --> 22:02.360
around christmas hopefully the ps3 will be coming out at the same time because i hear they're having

22:02.360 --> 22:08.440
a lot of trouble with that so yeah are they going to do different colors and all that stuff oh i'm

22:08.440 --> 22:13.640
Sure, I'm sure they'll do it. I mean what they have white and black right now. They'll probably come out with some

22:14.280 --> 22:18.040
Other colors that you can get blue pink, you know

22:18.040 --> 22:23.320
I've been a little tough on the PSP lately, but it does sound like there are some good new stuff coming out for it

22:23.320 --> 22:25.320
So that's that's kind of especially that game wise

22:25.680 --> 22:31.960
Hopefully with this new PSP will come over the second goddamn analog stick like they friggin need on this thing

22:31.960 --> 22:34.440
I would really change it that radically

22:34.440 --> 22:39.000
Because now me having a first-gen PSP who's not really interested in upgrading,

22:39.000 --> 22:43.680
I'd be totally screwed if games started supporting it. It's just like the whole Xbox 360 hard drive thing.

22:43.680 --> 22:48.340
If you've got a core with no hard drive, you're gonna get screwed in some of these later releases when people require it.

22:48.340 --> 22:49.840
So what? Here's the thing.

22:49.840 --> 22:53.040
I mean, look at the games that came out for the late PlayStation stuff.

22:53.040 --> 22:57.040
They supported only the DualShock 2. If you didn't buy a DualShock controller, you're fucked.

22:57.040 --> 22:59.540
Oh well, that's gonna be the case with this.

22:59.540 --> 23:03.240
They needed to have a goddamn second analog stick on this

23:03.240 --> 23:08.200
because you try, you know, controlling, I don't know, let's say for example in Katamari,

23:08.200 --> 23:12.120
you try controlling your Katamari with the four buttons, doesn't work, it's not as good

23:12.120 --> 23:13.120
as an analog stick.

23:13.120 --> 23:18.120
They need another analog stick on there because it'll just be so much better for a lot, especially

23:18.120 --> 23:21.080
if they're first person shooter games that they have coming out for this, it'd be a whole

23:21.080 --> 23:24.360
lot better.

23:24.360 --> 23:27.600
Let's move on to another story here, another big Sony title.

23:27.600 --> 23:31.200
It's not being made by Sony, but it will be on your Playstation 2 at some point.

23:31.200 --> 23:37.820
Final Fantasy XII is coming out, I believe this week in Japan, very, very soon here,

23:37.820 --> 23:42.980
and Famitsu Magazine, of course this huge, huge gaming magazine in Japan, often known

23:42.980 --> 23:50.060
for its very strict reviews, very few games have ever gotten a perfect 40 out of 40 score.

23:50.060 --> 23:54.720
The only games that have ever gotten this, The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, Soul

23:54.720 --> 24:01.400
The original one on Dreamcast, Vagrant Story, Zelda the Wind Waker, and Nintendogs have

24:01.400 --> 24:03.280
only ever gotten a perfect 40 out of 40.

24:03.280 --> 24:08.720
Well now, Final Fantasy XII joins that little exclusive club there, getting a perfect score

24:08.720 --> 24:11.080
from Famitsu Magazine.

24:11.080 --> 24:14.720
I have to admit, I'm actually not surprised about Final Fantasy XII getting a 40, because

24:14.720 --> 24:18.640
it seems like it's going to be a very incredibly comprehensive game that's going to give many

24:18.640 --> 24:20.040
fanboys much satisfaction.

24:20.040 --> 24:24.480
I was more surprised, I never realized Nintendogs got a 40 out of 40, and I was kind of like,

24:24.480 --> 24:30.760
That's a little surprising have they played vagrant story because it's not that great of a game well

24:30.760 --> 24:35.080
But maybe we have that whole audience in Japan versus audience in the US

24:35.700 --> 24:41.820
No, I played vagrant story. I have a per I like the Japanese games, and it wasn't that good well

24:42.340 --> 24:46.200
Famitsu begs to differ with you, so anyway of course this score is now

24:46.200 --> 24:51.080
Just building more and more excitement amongst the fanboys that you know OMG this game's coming out soon

24:51.080 --> 24:54.040
Wait, do you know when Final Fantasy XII slated for the US?

24:54.040 --> 24:55.040
I can't even remember.

24:55.040 --> 24:56.040
It keeps getting juggled around.

24:56.040 --> 24:57.040
It doesn't have a date.

24:57.040 --> 24:58.600
I think it's eventually.

24:58.600 --> 25:00.200
So like when Advent Children comes out?

25:00.200 --> 25:01.200
Like around that same time?

25:01.200 --> 25:02.200
Around the same time.

25:02.200 --> 25:03.200
No, no.

25:03.200 --> 25:04.200
You know that's the same time we get the PS3.

25:04.200 --> 25:05.760
Advent Children is in April.

25:05.760 --> 25:06.760
Before the apocalypse.

25:06.760 --> 25:07.760
Oh, okay.

25:07.760 --> 25:08.760
That's good.

25:08.760 --> 25:09.880
Well, obviously before Christmas, right?

25:09.880 --> 25:11.680
It's got to come out before Christmas.

25:11.680 --> 25:13.960
So we know at least that.

25:13.960 --> 25:14.960
But Christmas, what year?

25:14.960 --> 25:15.960
What decade?

25:15.960 --> 25:16.960
Shut up.

25:16.960 --> 25:17.960
Shut up.

25:17.960 --> 25:19.960
Alright, let's move on to another story.

25:19.960 --> 25:25.640
Another very popular franchise would be, well, anything made by Miyamoto, so what's Miyamoto

25:25.640 --> 25:26.640
getting?

25:26.640 --> 25:28.400
He's getting knighted by the French.

25:28.400 --> 25:32.440
I'm not sure if that's more of a compliment, or a...

25:32.440 --> 25:33.440
Anyway.

25:33.440 --> 25:34.440
Hey, now watch it.

25:34.440 --> 25:35.480
We might have listeners in France.

25:35.480 --> 25:36.480
Be careful.

25:36.480 --> 25:42.580
No, actually, well, tomorrow, March 13th, three game designers, including Miyamoto,

25:42.580 --> 25:44.880
are going to be knighted.

25:44.880 --> 25:49.360
And don't ask me to pronounce the other two game designers if we don't care about them.

25:49.360 --> 25:53.380
We just care about the fact that he's gonna be knighted and I had to laugh because I read

25:53.380 --> 25:57.880
the story on Forecolor Rebellion and they have the funniest picture.

25:57.880 --> 26:03.480
He's like wearing some 1-up shirt and he has the Zelda sword and shield and he just looks

26:03.480 --> 26:06.880
like a dumbass but it's hilarious.

26:06.880 --> 26:09.880
He's just so happy and childish.

26:09.880 --> 26:14.560
I love Kojima though, or not Kojima, Miyamoto, sorry I was thinking of another upcoming story.

26:14.560 --> 26:19.560
I love Miyamoto though because he's always so animated, like whenever you see him.

26:19.560 --> 26:21.120
I bumped into him at E3.

26:21.120 --> 26:22.120
Really?

26:22.120 --> 26:23.120
That's awesome.

26:23.120 --> 26:24.120
And you survived?

26:24.120 --> 26:25.120
Yes.

26:25.120 --> 26:26.120
And I survived.

26:26.120 --> 26:29.400
You didn't fall down like, oh my god, my life is complete?

26:29.400 --> 26:30.680
Yeah, most fangirls would have fainted.

26:30.680 --> 26:34.640
I bumped into Kojima too, the year before.

26:34.640 --> 26:36.840
How do you live?

26:36.840 --> 26:38.360
I've been touched by fame.

26:38.360 --> 26:41.240
I was a sweating little fangirl when I met Akira Yomoka.

26:41.240 --> 26:42.240
That was pretty awesome.

26:42.240 --> 26:44.920
because you're like, I'm a Silent Hill, ahh.

26:44.920 --> 26:47.720
We were doing an interview that never recorded.

26:47.720 --> 26:50.400
Don't remind me about the last interview at Konami booth.

26:50.400 --> 26:53.440
Anyway, let's move on to another story.

26:53.440 --> 26:56.880
Let's go over to Dark Sakura, who has

26:56.880 --> 26:58.840
a story about the Nintendo DS.

26:58.840 --> 27:00.320
There's a little program out.

27:00.320 --> 27:03.480
It's a freeware called Pointy Remote,

27:03.480 --> 27:08.800
where you can use your DS to control your computer.

27:08.800 --> 27:10.360
I personally haven't tried it.

27:10.360 --> 27:16.860
I'm not about to go opening up my DS or anything, but it lets you use the touchpad to select

27:16.860 --> 27:20.960
icons to zoom in.

27:20.960 --> 27:26.780
There's actually on one emulation.com there's a thread actually going on about it for anyone

27:26.780 --> 27:31.200
who wants to check it out.

27:31.200 --> 27:35.760
It looks like that it's still very experimental, they're still working on it.

27:35.760 --> 27:37.860
It looks cool, it's a neat idea.

27:37.860 --> 27:41.860
I honestly don't think that I would ever bother doing anything like that with my DS.

27:41.860 --> 27:45.860
I don't think you have to open it up though.

27:45.860 --> 27:49.860
All you'd have to do is just

27:49.860 --> 27:53.860
reflash it I guess. I don't feel like doing anything to my DS. I'm still

27:53.860 --> 27:57.860
busy playing Animal Crossing. Yes, my DS is a holy object that cannot

27:57.860 --> 28:01.860
be violated by the hands of man.

28:01.860 --> 28:05.860
It will be using the

28:05.860 --> 28:12.340
the Wi-Fi. So you could actually, in theory, take it out, you know, and use it elsewhere.

28:12.340 --> 28:19.540
So it's a good idea. It's a neat idea, but I don't think I would do anything with it.

28:19.540 --> 28:22.820
They should, though, have a similar device, though. I think they could make a lot of money with that.

28:24.260 --> 28:31.460
All right. Moving on, let's go over to Loki for some updates regarding Midway.

28:31.460 --> 28:37.060
Yeah, some news on the newest Mortal Kombat, Midway, got some news actually for Midway,

28:37.060 --> 28:39.780
Namco, and Ubisoft, so it should be good.

28:39.780 --> 28:44.780
The first, of course, is coming from Midway's Gamer Day, and I was unaware that everyone

28:44.780 --> 28:47.540
had their own Gamer Day, but you know, I guess they do.

28:47.540 --> 28:52.580
Anyways, some of the titles that they've announced, they're coming out this year, the first one

28:52.580 --> 28:58.900
being a kind of a portable game system title for PlayStation 2 and Game Boy Advance, the

28:58.900 --> 29:04.260
New Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, which of course is a fun little cartoon on Cartoon

29:04.260 --> 29:05.460
Network.

29:05.460 --> 29:09.740
Of course, they've got to have their own sports licenses.

29:09.740 --> 29:18.020
MLB Slugfest 2006, almost slipped there with the 2K6, which is going to be actually a budget

29:18.020 --> 29:23.940
game coming out at about 20 bucks, so that's pretty cool for PlayStation 2 and Xbox.

29:23.940 --> 29:29.700
And of course, they have some info on the new Mortal Kombat Armageddon, which is basically

29:29.700 --> 29:34.460
going to contain every single Mortal Kombat character in the Mortal Kombat universe, plus

29:34.460 --> 29:37.420
a creative fighter and creative fatality mode.

29:37.420 --> 29:39.660
Just looks really cool.

29:39.660 --> 29:45.020
And then for your PSP fans, they of course have Mortal Kombat Unchained, or Mortal Kombat

29:45.020 --> 29:50.580
Deception Unchained, which is kind of an update to the original Deception game, of course

29:50.580 --> 29:58.880
with bonus characters including Katana, Jax, Frost, Blaze, Goro, and Shao Kahn as well.

29:58.880 --> 29:59.880
So that's pretty sweet.

29:59.880 --> 30:06.160
And then of course if you're an NBA fan, NBA Ballers Phenom, which also goes with NBA Ballers

30:06.160 --> 30:07.800
Rebound for the PSP.

30:07.800 --> 30:12.960
Those kind of different take on the basketball games basically have to kind of become a star

30:12.960 --> 30:19.960
in a week so you get noticed by both sports agents and talent agents.

30:19.960 --> 30:25.040
What's kind of funny is they had one minigame in this that's kind of like DDR, you're dancing

30:25.040 --> 30:30.360
with mascots, so I thought that was kind of funny when I saw the one cheat on that.

30:30.360 --> 30:34.860
And then of course, if you're a Rampage fan and love the original arcade game, they're

30:34.860 --> 30:39.720
making yet another version of Rampage called Rampage Total Destructions coming out next

30:39.720 --> 30:44.240
month and what's also really cool about it, other than being able to play as George, Lizzie

30:44.240 --> 30:49.260
and Ralph, you get to play 25 different characters on top of that, plus it includes the original

30:49.260 --> 30:55.340
rampage game and rampage world tour that came out on Playstation 2 a while back.

30:55.340 --> 30:57.500
Not a big fan of any rampage game since the original.

30:57.500 --> 31:02.040
It's also under $20.

31:02.040 --> 31:04.860
If you're not a huge fan of it, I mean at least it's not that expensive.

31:04.860 --> 31:06.500
Maybe a rental.

31:06.500 --> 31:11.600
Exactly, and of course their big title for this year is going to be the Spy Hunter, Nor

31:11.600 --> 31:14.860
the Run of course featuring The Rock and with the movie coming out.

31:14.860 --> 31:19.020
Isn't that risky because I don't see that movie doing very well but of course now that

31:19.020 --> 31:22.580
I said that it'll probably be huge it's gonna be a good action movie put that

31:22.580 --> 31:28.740
way I mean doom did pretty well it did it did okay okay well it certainly did

31:28.740 --> 31:32.380
it certainly did better than House of the Dead let's let's leave it that way

31:32.380 --> 31:39.540
okay and then finally a strange hold which is gonna be it's gonna be kind of

31:39.540 --> 31:44.260
a I believe a movie and game tie-in type thing straight with you know being

31:44.260 --> 31:49.420
created by Midway and John Woo so it's gonna be kind of a third-person kung-fu

31:49.420 --> 31:54.340
cinematic game which is kind of interesting. Now all done with Midway

31:54.340 --> 31:58.300
here let's move on to Ubisoft and Ubisoft is gonna have a ton of stuff coming out

31:58.300 --> 32:04.600
in the Tom Clancy series. First being Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas which is

32:04.600 --> 32:10.520
coming out on both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and the Revolution as well as

32:10.520 --> 32:16.040
PC and PSP and probably current gen stuff as well, I'm assuming.

32:16.040 --> 32:24.240
Of course, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon 4, which is going to be coming out on Playstation 3

32:24.240 --> 32:25.340
as well.

32:25.340 --> 32:30.920
And then of course a new Tom Clancy franchise, Tom Clancy's Firehawk, which is coming out

32:30.920 --> 32:33.640
on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.

32:33.640 --> 32:37.200
I've never really heard of Firehawk, so that should be interesting.

32:37.200 --> 32:42.840
Assassin, coming out also on all the next-gen systems, one that I was really excited about,

32:42.840 --> 32:43.840
Luminous 2.

32:43.840 --> 32:44.840
Hooray!

32:44.840 --> 32:45.840
Me too, very excited.

32:45.840 --> 32:46.840
Woohoo!

32:46.840 --> 32:47.840
PSP and Playstation 2.

32:47.840 --> 32:48.840
Yeah!

32:48.840 --> 32:49.840
Hello!

32:49.840 --> 32:50.840
Thank you!

32:50.840 --> 32:51.840
So that's pretty awesome.

32:51.840 --> 32:53.720
Big kisses!

32:53.720 --> 33:00.080
And then a couple other things, there's Rayman 4 coming out on the next-gen systems and Playstation

33:00.080 --> 33:05.580
2 and handhelds, and the new Might and Magic game, Dark Messiah of Might and Magic on the

33:05.580 --> 33:12.980
next-gen systems and PC so dear luminous creators online versus K thanks

33:12.980 --> 33:18.300
finally Namco's lineup which is pretty sweet we've got actually next month ace

33:18.300 --> 33:23.340
combat zero coming out for a ace combat fan me and my Katamari coming out later

33:23.340 --> 33:28.020
this year which is pretty sweet Snoopy and the Red Baron coming out fall of

33:28.020 --> 33:32.180
this year which is gonna be pretty cool the only next-gen game they had coming

33:32.180 --> 33:36.600
out this year is Frame City Killer, and that's been delayed numerous times. I think it's

33:36.600 --> 33:43.040
now slated for around July, which is interesting. And of course Pac-Man fans will be loving

33:43.040 --> 33:47.960
the fact that Pac-Man World Rally is coming out, a new racing game. Hopefully they'll

33:47.960 --> 33:53.280
come out with a new Mario Kart unlike they did in the arcade. And actually I hope they

33:53.280 --> 33:58.800
don't because Mario Kart Arcade, not that hot. Okay, well fine. And if you're a PZ fan,

33:58.800 --> 34:02.800
Mark of Chaos coming out this fall, so it should be pretty sweet.

34:02.800 --> 34:06.800
Awesome! Lots and lots of goodies coming out this year.

34:06.800 --> 34:09.800
We're now in that period of the year, especially building up to E3,

34:09.800 --> 34:12.800
where we're going to hear a lot of flood of just game announcements.

34:12.800 --> 34:15.800
And I got another one for you guys, and this is kind of a duh.

34:15.800 --> 34:19.800
I mean, we all knew this was coming, but Guitar Hero 2 has been,

34:19.800 --> 34:22.800
for all purposes, confirmed.

34:22.800 --> 34:25.800
Kelly Sumner, who's the CEO of Red Octane, has said,

34:25.800 --> 34:31.080
has said, we are working on Guitar Hero 2 which will have 40 plus new tracks, yay, I

34:31.080 --> 34:34.440
think a lot of us were waiting for that, sounds like it's going to be awesome, but here's

34:34.440 --> 34:39.640
the part that's kind of interesting, he also says that there's going to be genre spin-offs

34:39.640 --> 34:46.280
like country rock, metal edition, and possibly even doing a plug and play, like you know

34:46.280 --> 34:50.080
how they have those joysticks, well what if you just bought a guitar, no Playstation needed,

34:50.080 --> 34:55.480
plug a guitar right into the TV, that worries me a little bit, because now I'm going, uh

34:55.480 --> 34:58.320
Uh oh, is this too much of a good thing?

34:58.320 --> 35:01.820
Can oversaturation destroy Guitar Hero?

35:01.820 --> 35:03.820
What do you think?

35:03.820 --> 35:04.820
Maybe.

35:04.820 --> 35:05.820
Depends on how they do it.

35:05.820 --> 35:11.520
If they do it like, if it's exactly like Guitar Hero, you know, just as good, then maybe it

35:11.520 --> 35:15.280
might work, but eh, no.

35:15.280 --> 35:16.720
I'm kind of worried about that.

35:16.720 --> 35:21.880
It's kind of too bad for Red Octane that Guitar Hero wasn't an Xbox title because then they

35:21.880 --> 35:27.240
could be doing these expansions through live but I mean that's not I guess

35:27.240 --> 35:31.160
PlayStation 2 doesn't really allow that same type of thing so I guess this is

35:31.160 --> 35:35.040
what they have to do of course we've never have we ever really had games here

35:35.040 --> 35:38.200
that use the append idea like they did in Japan with some of the beat manias

35:38.200 --> 35:42.000
we have appendis well there's something that they can do this is kind of a

35:42.000 --> 35:46.240
brand new thing they did it was SOCOM with downloadable maps you can actually

35:46.240 --> 35:50.560
you pay a fee online I believe it's five dollars and you download the maps to a

35:50.560 --> 35:57.200
USB card and if you have a USB memory card or something like that, then you plug that

35:57.200 --> 36:04.740
into your Playstation 2 and it unlocks the maps and it downloads to the hard drive type

36:04.740 --> 36:05.740
of thing.

36:05.740 --> 36:11.100
Of course that's a lot of factors that don't really bode well, I mean the PS2 Slim doesn't

36:11.100 --> 36:13.280
have a hard drive.

36:13.280 --> 36:17.500
Everyone has a USB memory stick, not everyone is willing to pay for this and download it

36:17.500 --> 36:24.100
off the internet type things so I don't know comments from the chatroom www.orangeloungeradio.com

36:24.100 --> 36:30.540
we have a wolfwind shadow says do an 80s version on guitar hero winner and I'll be like here

36:30.540 --> 36:35.120
rock power ballads with this guy just won the internet that's a great idea I would love

36:35.120 --> 36:41.120
to see early 90s music as well though like I want my Nelson no my poison my damn Yankees

36:41.120 --> 36:45.200
motley crew Tesla this that would be awesome

36:45.200 --> 36:48.880
let's just get our here are guitar hero this target

36:48.880 --> 36:53.080
Ted Nugent for sure hero condition heck yeah

36:53.080 --> 36:56.360
all Queen where they have where they have one Queen song in the no we need we

36:56.360 --> 36:57.080
need a

36:57.080 --> 37:01.360
guitar hero j rock version to go out in Japan think we'll ever see guitar freaks

37:01.360 --> 37:05.340
in the US and where do you know konami doesn't really have a chance now

37:05.340 --> 37:08.920
I I think they blew it they blew it big time they should they should have

37:08.920 --> 37:10.280
released it when they could have huh

37:10.280 --> 37:13.500
They blew it big time. I think they I think they could still do it

37:13.500 --> 37:17.300
I I have a feeling they're gonna try to they can still do it then they could try suing them again

37:17.340 --> 37:24.480
We'll see anyway speaking of things Konami is doing Loki. You've been following a little bit. What's going on with DDR supernova. Yep now they're doing

37:25.340 --> 37:27.340
location testing in Japan and

37:27.820 --> 37:32.200
a lot more songs have been added to the location test including some of our

37:33.180 --> 37:38.320
Old favorites here our new Captain Jack centerfold the 130 BPM move it remix

37:38.320 --> 37:44.320
which is interesting they also feature some doesn't really matter by Janet

37:44.320 --> 37:49.240
Jackson let's see here Kylie Minogue love at first sight

37:49.240 --> 37:56.640
twin master plan mix some pretty big names there Janet and Kylie yeah Wookie

37:56.640 --> 38:01.600
Wookie by Macho man okay and for every big name there's got to be a who what

38:01.600 --> 38:02.600
What the F is this?

38:02.600 --> 38:03.600
Alright.

38:03.600 --> 38:04.600
I thought that was funny.

38:04.600 --> 38:10.000
Uh, was it, uh, De Capo by, um, Ace of Base?

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
Which is...

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
Da Capo, I think it is.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
Da Capo.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
I'm sorry.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
Yeah.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
Golden Sky by Smile Decay.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Huh?

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
That's kind of neat.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
Return of Smile Decay.

38:19.000 --> 38:22.160
Um, then of course more Konami original songs including Peace and then this little, like,

38:22.160 --> 38:29.520
happy face thing, then all, yeah, by B4U, it's like a little squiggly happy face thing.

38:29.520 --> 38:35.740
Then, of course, My Only Shining Star by Nayoki, featuring Becky Lucinda, which I guess it's

38:35.740 --> 38:39.380
okay because you kind of slipped up on the forums and said, oh, we've actually heard

38:39.380 --> 38:40.660
this song.

38:40.660 --> 38:43.100
We have heard this song.

38:43.100 --> 38:48.500
I can really say we've been asked not to play the song yet, so we're making good on that

38:48.500 --> 38:52.580
because we don't want to piss people off at Konami when they've been pretty good to us.

38:52.580 --> 38:57.100
But all I can say about it is that the announcer is in the song, and it's very strange.

38:57.100 --> 38:59.400
It's let me put it this way it's like

39:01.580 --> 39:07.160
Was it a deep 1998 with the guy in the background

39:08.900 --> 39:16.060
Shouting the lyrics to a song. Yeah, it's like and it's exactly, you know, like your d2r really, you know for you type things. I

39:17.140 --> 39:23.300
Didn't like it. I listen to the song once I'm like no I now key fans will be fine with it. It's a good

39:23.300 --> 39:28.940
It's it's exactly 1998 or anything like that if you're you like that superhero beat stuff

39:29.980 --> 39:31.140
great

39:31.140 --> 39:34.700
Like I said before, you know the D to the A to the end

39:34.700 --> 39:38.440
Yeah, D to the A to the end to the C. That's like how it ends right or something like that

39:38.440 --> 39:45.300
It's really cheesy, but you know, it's whatever there. You know what there'll be people that love it. So have fun with it more

39:45.940 --> 39:52.640
More songs though Balmani crossovers including some stuff from para para dynamite raved the superhero version and can't stop

39:52.640 --> 39:58.540
falling in love the superhero version which are pretty interesting then extra

39:58.540 --> 40:02.980
stages are kind of interesting on top of fascination max they also have healing

40:02.980 --> 40:10.260
division by these these these starred which is interesting which is I'm sure

40:10.260 --> 40:13.700
it's just another Naoki pseudonym honestly and then the one more extra

40:13.700 --> 40:18.740
stage is chaos by desire returns oh that'll make people happy because these

40:18.740 --> 40:23.380
Desire did like, you know, Trip Machine, and I think it was a big healing vision and all

40:23.380 --> 40:24.380
that stuff, right?

40:24.380 --> 40:26.060
So that'll be fun.

40:26.060 --> 40:31.180
So I'm happy to hear a new healing vision song, and Chaos sounds good.

40:31.180 --> 40:34.220
Just a fascination, Max sucks so bad!

40:34.220 --> 40:35.220
Alright.

40:35.220 --> 40:38.140
Well, at least they're giving you options now, you don't have to play that one.

40:38.140 --> 40:39.620
But it sucks so bad!

40:39.620 --> 40:40.620
Alright.

40:40.620 --> 40:43.300
Anyways, so I thought that was interesting.

40:43.300 --> 40:47.540
Well, we know that we have a lot of fans out there who grew up with us on the music games,

40:47.540 --> 40:50.300
But of course we talk about all the games, we want to open up the floor right now for

40:50.300 --> 40:55.140
your feedback and you can give us a call, we're on the Skype line right now, username

40:55.140 --> 41:00.460
is OrangeLoungeRadio or you can actually pick up the phone and call us, 916-226-9067, but

41:00.460 --> 41:05.540
here's a thing that may be a toll call for you, it is not a toll free number, so please

41:05.540 --> 41:09.940
ask the person who pays the bills if you can call before you do, so let's head on over

41:09.940 --> 41:14.680
to the Skype line and of course we're getting hammered tonight and we can't always answer

41:14.680 --> 41:16.340
all the calls, so sorry guys.

41:16.340 --> 41:22.980
we go uh hi you're on orange launch radio hello can you hear me yes who's this nintendo

41:22.980 --> 41:29.060
maniac 64 hello nintendo maniac 64 what's on your mind um i want to give a shout out

41:29.060 --> 41:37.860
to uh shout out to who carissa gregory okay why um because i hope she's listening in because

41:37.860 --> 41:45.480
like i referred her to the show here and i just hope she's listening in is this a special

41:45.480 --> 41:51.920
friend? No, just a friend in general. Okay, I had to check. Yeah, she probably punched

41:51.920 --> 41:58.560
me in the face. Is she a gamer? Is she a girl gamer? Yeah. Do you guys play games together?

41:58.560 --> 42:04.080
We don't live that close together. Okay. Well, you know, thanks to technology, the Internet,

42:04.080 --> 42:08.520
you can play games across the Internet. MMOs and Xbox Live, all that fun stuff. Yeah. She

42:08.520 --> 42:13.240
does RPGs, but I'm not much an engineer. All right. Yeah. All right, well, what's on your

42:13.240 --> 42:18.120
mine specifically uh in video games this week well you guys are talking about like cars with

42:18.120 --> 42:23.720
guns and things like that uh-huh like if you want a game with cars with guns like play bow mode and

42:23.720 --> 42:30.040
rush 2049 i haven't played it maybe i will what what makes this game so great compared to burnout

42:30.040 --> 42:35.480
and full auto and all that stuff basically think mario kart bow mode except you actually have guns

42:35.480 --> 42:38.840
mounted on top of your cars and you're literally are shooting each other and blowing each other

42:38.840 --> 42:40.840
Well, that sounds like full-auto to me.

42:40.840 --> 42:41.840
Really?

42:41.840 --> 42:44.840
Yeah, full-auto is pretty much the same thing except you get mines and all that fun stuff too.

42:44.840 --> 42:47.840
Wait, he's saying Rush 2049. I thought they didn't have guns in it.

42:47.840 --> 42:49.840
Well, he said Battle Edition.

42:49.840 --> 42:50.840
Oh. No, Battle Mode.

42:50.840 --> 42:51.840
Battle Mode.

42:51.840 --> 42:54.840
Same game, just different mode.

42:54.840 --> 42:59.840
Well, obviously this is a very popular genre of games as cars with guns and destruction is fun.

42:59.840 --> 43:04.840
And I'm all for it, because honestly if I can take out my aggressions on the Xbox then I don't do it for real

43:04.840 --> 43:10.840
when I see those, you know, old ladies driving the SUVs that, you know, can't stay in one lane and all that fun stuff.

43:10.840 --> 43:14.840
Because, you know, in full auto, then I could just, like, when I see the SUVs,

43:14.840 --> 43:17.840
duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, huh, rough points.

43:18.840 --> 43:20.840
Why are you shaking your head at me, Dark Sakura?

43:20.840 --> 43:25.840
Just because I had a mental image of that when I was in Roseville earlier today trying to go somewhere to eat,

43:25.840 --> 43:27.840
and there were so many SUVs in the parking lot.

43:27.840 --> 43:29.840
Let me give you the full experience, Dark Sakura.

43:29.840 --> 43:34.840
Sometimes I'll play full auto and talk to a friend on the cell phone just so I can get the full experience.

43:34.840 --> 43:36.840
You're so awful!

43:36.840 --> 43:37.840
Alright, just messing.

43:37.840 --> 43:41.840
Uh, Nintendo Maniac, any other feedback, hellos you want to say before we let you go?

43:41.840 --> 43:48.840
Um, I'm not really sure if my MP3 Pro plug-in thingy is working.

43:48.840 --> 43:50.840
I've only got it to work in Winamp.

43:50.840 --> 43:54.840
MP3 Pro will only work in Winamp. It doesn't work in iTunes, unfortunately.

43:54.840 --> 43:57.840
I know, I'm using Winamp.

43:57.840 --> 44:05.380
Okay, yeah, um you you're not gonna hear too much of a difference this time at the 64 K. It's really good either way

44:06.120 --> 44:10.960
But you know if you have it installed and you have it selected and ready to go you should be set

44:11.460 --> 44:18.080
Okay. All right. Have a good one. Have one last question. Sure. Okay. Does it affect regular mp3s too?

44:19.020 --> 44:26.400
No, not unless you purposely save your mp3s as mp3 Pro some programs like Adobe Audition will allow you to encode an mp3 Pro

44:26.400 --> 44:30.600
right away but you're probably not going to notice much of a difference okay all

44:30.600 --> 44:36.400
right have a good one buddy thanks for calling all right let's go to another

44:36.400 --> 44:42.800
call here on the skype line hello you are on orange launch radio hello hi who's

44:42.800 --> 44:46.800
this this is wolf wind shadow hello wolf wind shadow you're the one that wanted

44:46.800 --> 44:52.820
the 80s guitar hero oh yeah I grew up in the 80s we did too and we you know we

44:52.820 --> 44:55.960
were just talking about how old we feel tonight but that's alright you know what

44:55.960 --> 45:01.940
We need we need to add like old-school Aerosmith love in an elevator. How fun would that be on guitar hero?

45:01.940 --> 45:04.540
Well, what's on your mind? Yeah. Well, what's on your mind tonight? Oh

45:05.940 --> 45:11.860
Not too much just ran run into your show for the first time. Awesome. How'd you find us? I

45:13.060 --> 45:15.220
just randomly searching for

45:15.940 --> 45:21.580
Places that yeah you Skype. Oh, wow. Okay, that's cool. Awesome. It is pretty unique

45:21.580 --> 45:26.820
You know, I'm gonna say we were and I'm gonna make a claim here and somebody will probably dispute that

45:26.820 --> 45:32.480
but we were honestly one of the first online radio stations to back Skype instead of a skype line because we've been doing Skype for

45:32.480 --> 45:39.420
A long long time and now it's really catching on but you know, we're happy to have pioneered the skype line thing

45:40.220 --> 45:46.500
So, oh, yeah, I'm a computer consultant. I have it up on my website honest. Awesome. Well, you sound great

45:46.500 --> 45:50.860
I should have guessed you were a former Skype user because sometimes we have first-timers on Skype that don't sound so great

45:50.860 --> 45:57.040
But we're really glad that we we got random people connecting to our show. What kind of games you've been playing this week

45:58.540 --> 46:03.920
Actually, not too many this week. I'm getting ready to go back to school and finish up my degrees

46:03.920 --> 46:08.040
So the real real life's got to come first sometimes right dark Sakura

46:09.100 --> 46:11.100
sadly, yes

46:12.180 --> 46:16.920
How to accommodate life, okay. Well if you didn't have to be going back to school what game would be you be checking out

46:16.920 --> 46:18.420
right now

46:18.420 --> 46:21.960
Actually, I'd be checking out some of the games with cars and guns. There you go

46:22.480 --> 46:27.200
It's a big thing right now better, which are you a burnout man or a full auto man?

46:28.440 --> 46:30.640
Full auto hi any particular reason why?

46:31.440 --> 46:33.440
not really just

46:33.480 --> 46:36.480
Interesting because you actually get guns on your car in full auto, huh?

46:37.200 --> 46:42.360
Probably something like that. Well wolf win shadow anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight. Oh not tonight

46:42.560 --> 46:46.800
I'm actually enjoying the show. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. We love getting new listeners

46:46.800 --> 46:49.120
So, uh, you know, tell a friend help support

46:49.760 --> 46:54.540
Independent online radio. We love it. Give us money. Yeah. No, we're not asking for money yet. So

46:55.520 --> 46:58.240
Alright, thanks so much. We'll finish every shooting in take care

46:58.240 --> 47:02.600
And you know what write red octane and tell them your idea for the 80s guitar hero. I think it should happen

47:02.600 --> 47:05.900
Oh, yeah. All right. Take care, buddy. Have a good one

47:05.900 --> 47:13.340
All right. Let's go to another call here. Let's go. We'll pick up this line. Hi. You're

47:13.340 --> 47:18.620
on Orange Launch Radio. Hey. I'm not asking for money yet. Hi. Turn down your speakers

47:18.620 --> 47:21.940
because we're hearing ourselves pretty bad. Give me a second. I have to turn down. Sure.

47:21.940 --> 47:29.700
Sure. We got time. All right. Okay. What's on your mind? Is it good now? I think we're

47:29.700 --> 47:35.420
okay. What's on your mind? All right. I kind of joined in a bit late, but I heard Loki

47:35.420 --> 47:38.300
talking about a song he just hated. What song was that?

47:38.300 --> 47:41.540
Because I know it's on the new mix. What song was he talking about?

47:41.540 --> 47:44.860
Fascination Max, right, Loki?

47:44.860 --> 47:48.820
Fascination Max? Are you just trying to get me to hate you? I mean, I'm a Mac user. I love

47:48.820 --> 47:52.460
Fascination Max. Are you just trying to get me to hate you?

47:52.460 --> 47:56.300
He's a Mac user and he loves Fascination Max. He's just the anti-Loki.

47:56.300 --> 48:01.620
He's got bad taste in music and in computing.

48:01.620 --> 48:07.620
Well, I can tell you right now that Loki does not blow up in the presence of Max because there's one pointing directly at him.

48:09.620 --> 48:12.620
There's one redeeming quality, the PSV homebrew. That's good.

48:13.620 --> 48:18.620
You know, diversity makes the world go round, my friend. Sometimes we're just going to have to agree to disagree.

48:19.620 --> 48:22.620
I think when Loki goes to hell, it's going to be like an Apple store.

48:25.620 --> 48:26.620
Flat panel IMAX everywhere.

48:26.620 --> 48:32.180
We've got to let you go, because we're getting some more sound interference, but thanks for

48:32.180 --> 48:38.960
your call, buddy, and we'll slap Loki for you.

48:38.960 --> 48:42.180
Don't you love hearing from the fans, Loki?

48:42.180 --> 48:43.180
One more call.

48:43.180 --> 48:44.180
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

48:44.180 --> 48:45.180
Hey, this is J100Med here.

48:45.180 --> 48:46.180
Hello, my friend.

48:46.180 --> 48:47.180
What's on your mind?

48:47.180 --> 48:48.180
Nothing much.

48:48.180 --> 48:49.180
I just thought of this.

48:49.180 --> 48:55.660
I just thought of this, do you think they're going to have a dedication to Captain Jack

48:55.660 --> 48:58.940
on a supernova?

48:58.940 --> 49:03.220
I don't know how they could really do it unless maybe it's in the credits.

49:03.220 --> 49:08.280
I think that would be an appropriate way to do it or maybe they could even do something

49:08.280 --> 49:10.000
with the background to the song.

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
In memory of?

49:11.000 --> 49:13.580
You know, in memory of or something.

49:13.580 --> 49:14.580
Will they do it?

49:14.580 --> 49:16.280
I don't think they will.

49:16.280 --> 49:22.880
they had other dead artists in DDR before like just older artists I mean I

49:22.880 --> 49:26.120
don't know off the top of my head but maybe artists that have just were Ray

49:26.120 --> 49:32.240
Charles okay there you go Ray Charles is in DDR and there was no real uh wait

49:32.240 --> 49:38.120
wait is that was no no oh that's right just a couple here can you see how much

49:38.120 --> 49:43.480
I listen I follow the entertainment news I SSJ a really only time here this crap

49:43.480 --> 49:49.120
We have no idea no idea. It would be nice. What would you what would you do if you were Konami?

49:49.120 --> 49:53.580
How would you pay your respects to Captain Jack who passed away last year? I don't know probably have a pre

49:54.440 --> 49:58.000
like little picture before the pregame animation saying

49:58.760 --> 50:02.360
This is dedicated to Captain Jack kind of like burnout revenge

50:02.880 --> 50:08.160
Did they have yeah like that? Oh, I haven't I haven't seen it. No, it's there's a I don't know who the hell it is

50:08.160 --> 50:12.480
though. Interesting. Who is that? Some guy, I don't know. Some doctor. They could show

50:12.480 --> 50:16.800
his picture and do RIP, you know, birthdate, death date. I think if they did

50:16.800 --> 50:19.160
something really lovely with the background I think that would be

50:19.160 --> 50:21.880
appropriate so when people played the song they could, you know, why are you

50:21.880 --> 50:27.600
laughing? They could do it like Pixar, where Pixar at the end of the credits has, you know,

50:27.600 --> 50:30.700
babies that were, you know, babies that were born during the production of the

50:30.700 --> 50:35.640
film, they could have people that have died in the production of the game. It's

50:35.640 --> 50:39.000
really morbid but you know Captain Jack my soul

50:39.000 --> 50:42.880
alright SSG100 Matt anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

50:42.880 --> 50:43.840
Our profit margins?

50:43.840 --> 50:47.200
rockser

50:47.200 --> 50:50.920
nothing really I managed to actually get a sneak peek of a

50:50.920 --> 50:54.360
of a video game a movie that's coming out soon what's this

50:54.360 --> 50:58.080
it's called Staying Alive and what's it about

50:58.080 --> 51:02.840
it's not that movie with John Travolta was it? It's not Staying Alive it's called

51:02.840 --> 51:03.840
Stay Alive.

51:03.840 --> 51:04.840
Oh, Stay Alive.

51:04.840 --> 51:09.640
It's the one where the kids play the game, and when they die in the game, they die in

51:09.640 --> 51:10.640
real life.

51:10.640 --> 51:11.640
I saw a trailer.

51:11.640 --> 51:13.200
It's not necessarily a video game movie.

51:13.200 --> 51:16.580
It's more of a really crappy movie that they based around.

51:16.580 --> 51:19.240
It's capitalizing on the violent game culture.

51:19.240 --> 51:20.240
You know what it is?

51:20.240 --> 51:21.240
What did you think?

51:21.240 --> 51:22.240
You saw it.

51:22.240 --> 51:23.240
What did you think?

51:23.240 --> 51:26.240
Well, actually, no, I didn't really see it.

51:26.240 --> 51:31.320
There was an old school I went to visit, and I visited the video game section.

51:31.320 --> 51:38.980
They were giving them sneak peeks of the gameplay in the movie.

51:38.980 --> 51:45.800
The movie itself looks like Nightmare on Elm Street meets Ring, because if you die in the

51:45.800 --> 51:52.320
game you die in real life and then it's nonsense like that.

51:52.320 --> 51:55.440
Is it something that you will probably want to see?

51:55.440 --> 51:56.440
Probably not.

51:56.440 --> 52:00.880
Isn't that kid from Malcolm in the Middle in it?

52:00.880 --> 52:10.040
No, actually I don't know, but the guy who was in Hebrew Hammer, I'm not sure if anyone

52:10.040 --> 52:11.040
knows that.

52:11.040 --> 52:12.040
Oh, Adam Goldberg.

52:12.040 --> 52:13.040
Yeah.

52:13.040 --> 52:14.640
Yeah, you beat me to it.

52:14.640 --> 52:16.040
I'm just that good, Bugged.

52:16.040 --> 52:18.080
You should know I'm from 17 years.

52:18.080 --> 52:21.400
Yeah, but I saw in the trailer, this shouldn't be much of a spoiler because you see it in

52:21.400 --> 52:25.400
the trailer, he dies, which means his role isn't that big.

52:25.400 --> 52:26.400
Yeah obviously not.

52:26.400 --> 52:29.360
All right, well we'll see when the movie comes out.

52:29.360 --> 52:30.360
Much like Scream.

52:30.360 --> 52:32.200
We'll have an O.L.R. at the movie day.

52:32.200 --> 52:34.680
All right, SSG01 Hermat, thank you so much for calling.

52:34.680 --> 52:36.120
Appreciate it as always, bud.

52:36.120 --> 52:36.960
Have a good one.

52:36.960 --> 52:38.000
You too.

52:38.000 --> 52:39.280
All right, we're gonna close up the Skype line.

52:39.280 --> 52:41.200
We will try and take some more calls a little later tonight.

52:41.200 --> 52:43.680
Thank you guys for calling in and saying hello.

52:43.680 --> 52:44.720
We appreciate it.

52:44.720 --> 52:47.360
Let's go over to Dark Sakura.

52:47.360 --> 52:49.400
Yeah, we had a story there about,

52:49.400 --> 52:50.820
or no, I'm sorry, we had a call there

52:50.820 --> 52:52.760
where the guy wanted to,

52:52.760 --> 52:55.440
or I was asking, who was it, Nintendo Maniac 64,

52:55.440 --> 52:58.440
if he played online games with that girl he knew.

52:58.440 --> 53:01.240
there's one game that he will never play online no matter what, right?

53:01.240 --> 53:06.040
Nope. There's going to be no online mode for Virtua Fighter, which actually I don't

53:06.040 --> 53:07.400
really care about Virtua Fighter,

53:07.400 --> 53:10.740
but I just thought it was pretty funny that they were even trying.

53:10.740 --> 53:16.120
Hiroshi Kataoka, who was the, I guess, big guy behind Virtua Fighter,

53:16.120 --> 53:22.200
told EGM, basically, that they tried to do it online by simulating lag

53:22.200 --> 53:23.120
and timing

53:23.120 --> 53:27.440
and that it wasn't really gonna do, that it changed the gameplay way too much.

53:27.440 --> 53:31.420
Um, to quote, if we ever wanted to do an online fighting game, it would have to be something

53:31.420 --> 53:33.340
besides Virtua Fighter.

53:33.340 --> 53:39.540
So, maybe that's a hint at something else, but for right now, no online mode.

53:39.540 --> 53:40.540
Aww.

53:40.540 --> 53:45.320
Yeah, I don't know many people that are Virtua Fighter fans above all else.

53:45.320 --> 53:50.720
Like, you know, I know people that like Virtua Fighter, but they also like Dead or Alive

53:50.720 --> 53:51.720
or something, you know?

53:51.720 --> 53:52.720
Mortal Kombat.

53:52.720 --> 53:53.720
Or something about 3.

53:53.720 --> 53:58.360
who are our diehard Virtua Fighter fans who have been since day one.

53:58.360 --> 54:02.300
My bias against Virtua Fighter starts from day one because the game gave me like massive

54:02.300 --> 54:07.200
headaches, and so I just never got into playing it too much and then I found my love for Tekken.

54:07.200 --> 54:10.960
Yeah, I was gonna say, can you actually be a fan of both Virtua Fighter and Tekken?

54:10.960 --> 54:11.960
I'm not sure.

54:11.960 --> 54:12.960
Well, I'm sure you could.

54:12.960 --> 54:13.960
The world's on it.

54:13.960 --> 54:18.160
I mean, I'm not, but anyone can, it just depends on what you like.

54:18.160 --> 54:21.120
I don't see why you have to hate one thing to like the other.

54:21.120 --> 54:24.500
Well wasn't virtual fighter kind of the response to Tekken

54:25.800 --> 54:30.120
Actually virtual fighter was out if I do recall before Tekken. Oh, I don't know

54:30.120 --> 54:34.520
I saw that's something I saw on a TV show once. I don't know. It's like yeah

54:34.520 --> 54:37.000
I was that I think a year or so prior

54:37.000 --> 54:40.040
I was a real hardcore gamer when I was a kid

54:40.040 --> 54:43.640
But around the time that PlayStation first came out and all that 3d was getting big

54:43.640 --> 54:46.380
I kind of took a break from gaming for a while because you know

54:46.380 --> 54:49.340
I was going into school and all that and then I kind of came back into it

54:49.340 --> 54:53.900
But when I got my Playstation in college and Puzzle Fighter and all that stuff, so...

54:53.900 --> 54:54.900
Wasn't Virtua Fighter Saturn?

54:54.900 --> 54:58.260
Virtua Fighter, actually, if I do recall, was 32X.

54:58.260 --> 54:59.260
Wow.

54:59.260 --> 55:00.260
Oh, I think it was.

55:00.260 --> 55:04.100
Virtua Racing had the Humongous Genesis cartridge.

55:04.100 --> 55:07.660
No, Virtua Fighter was on Genesis, if I do recall.

55:07.660 --> 55:08.660
Really?

55:08.660 --> 55:10.460
Let me do a quick bit of research.

55:10.460 --> 55:12.500
I think it was either on Genesis or 32X.

55:12.500 --> 55:15.980
I think they put out a crap version on Genesis is what it is, because there was Virtua Fighter.

55:15.980 --> 55:16.980
Yeah, it was really awful.

55:16.980 --> 55:19.980
Tekken didn't make it to the home until PlayStation was out.

55:19.980 --> 55:23.980
So I still have a promo pack for my Saturn that has Virtua Fighter 2?

55:23.980 --> 55:28.980
Virtua Fighter 2 was one of the pack-in games for the Saturn.

55:28.980 --> 55:31.980
Right, with Daytona and something else I forgot that I don't play.

55:31.980 --> 55:34.980
Christmas Nights? No, Christmas Nights was a mail-in thing.

55:34.980 --> 55:36.980
Dark Knight in our chat room says,

55:36.980 --> 55:39.980
Saturn first, then 32X, then Genesis,

55:39.980 --> 55:41.980
but they're kinda going back and forth a little bit.

55:41.980 --> 55:44.980
No, because the 32X version was out before the Saturn was out.

55:44.980 --> 55:48.600
trying to figure it out right now in chat so I mean it's honestly it's not a

55:48.600 --> 55:54.040
big deal because I I had a 32x no I will I would trade back and forth my Nintendo

55:54.040 --> 55:58.400
and 32x with somebody and he had virtual fighter on 32x hmm interesting I mean I

55:58.400 --> 56:03.760
have the game now on 32x but Zaku in our chat room legend Zaku says 32x is the

56:03.760 --> 56:08.760
worst add-on ever would you agree no because of knuckles chaotic and Calibri

56:08.760 --> 56:12.340
oh you could catch I think you can play knuckles chaotic on a game tap I want to

56:12.340 --> 56:16.840
say they have on. I like Knuckles Chaotix because who remembers, alright, if anyone

56:16.840 --> 56:21.780
is into emulation there was a game called Sonic Crackers which from what I

56:21.780 --> 56:26.380
understand was the template for what Knuckles Chaotix became. Colibri was a

56:26.380 --> 56:31.820
really cool game we played as a little hummingbird. Oh I played that. And the best home

56:31.820 --> 56:38.900
version of Space Harrier apart from the re-releases was on 32x. Hmm. And

56:38.900 --> 56:42.380
and After Burner. I played Colibri on GameTap,

56:42.380 --> 56:45.460
made no sense to me at all. It's a freaky little weird game, but it's cool.

56:45.460 --> 56:49.100
But no, the best versions of Space Harrier and

56:49.100 --> 56:54.700
After Burner were on 32x. Alright, let's move on to another topic. I'm gonna talk

56:54.700 --> 56:56.900
about the Xbox 360, moving on to a new

56:56.900 --> 57:03.100
new platform. If you have a 360 but somehow haven't bought Xbox Live Gold,

57:03.100 --> 57:06.300
you're gonna get your chance to sample what it's all about. It's coming up at the

57:06.300 --> 57:08.020
end of the month, March 31st

57:08.020 --> 57:10.940
through April 2nd, only in the US though,

57:10.940 --> 57:14.160
sorry listeners in UK, Japan, et cetera.

57:14.160 --> 57:16.360
Verizon is gonna be sponsoring this.

57:16.360 --> 57:19.000
They're going to be giving Xbox Live Gold

57:19.000 --> 57:20.440
to everybody for the weekend,

57:20.440 --> 57:23.780
and also giving away one million points.

57:23.780 --> 57:26.140
Not all at once, but you can collect

57:26.140 --> 57:30.080
your 500 free Microsoft points, not sure how.

57:30.080 --> 57:33.140
I imagine it's going to involve selling your soul

57:33.140 --> 57:34.900
to Verizon in one way or another,

57:34.900 --> 57:35.740
but we'll see when that.

57:35.740 --> 57:37.740
It's an April Fools joke, look at the dates.

57:37.740 --> 57:39.740
March 31st to April 2nd? No, I don't know.

57:39.740 --> 57:40.740
It's right in the middle.

57:40.740 --> 57:43.740
But they're advertising it on Xbox Live right now, so I don't think it's an April Fools joke.

57:43.740 --> 57:44.740
The points are.

57:44.740 --> 57:49.740
But they're also going to have some tournaments, and I know one of them was for Geometry Wars, which I think is kind of neat.

57:49.740 --> 57:50.740
That's pretty cool.

57:50.740 --> 57:59.740
It's interesting. I mean, sure, it's corporate, but it's nice to see something different happening and some little promotions going on. I mean, it's kind of cool.

57:59.740 --> 58:04.460
Also, if you happen to purchase a copy of Ghost Recon Vans Warfighter, you get 48 hours

58:04.460 --> 58:08.180
of free Xbox Live Gold, there's a card in there too.

58:08.180 --> 58:12.320
But most likely if you, you know, bought that game, it would probably already have Xbox

58:12.320 --> 58:17.180
Live Gold anyways, because it's one of the reasons you would buy that game in the first

58:17.180 --> 58:18.180
place.

58:18.180 --> 58:19.180
Alright.

58:19.180 --> 58:23.340
Going to our chat room, who's of course still arguing about the Virtua Fighter thing, I'm

58:23.340 --> 58:26.620
sorry if multiple people have said this, but this is the first line I saw that kind of

58:26.620 --> 58:27.700
makes it clear here.

58:27.700 --> 58:35.580
Spikepoint in our chatroom says Virtua Fighter Saturn June 95 Virtua Fighter 32x November 95 according to game facts

58:35.580 --> 58:38.340
Oh, yeah, but I mean June to November

58:38.340 --> 58:41.340
It was just when I had cuz I don't really give yeah

58:41.340 --> 58:45.940
I grew up about Virtua Fighter people might remember it differently because that's a very close window

58:45.940 --> 58:49.160
I know that I know that I played it on 32x before I played it on Saturn

58:49.160 --> 58:53.340
But then again my friend who had a Saturn all he had were imported games, right?

58:53.340 --> 58:59.120
Alright kids, I don't care about Vulture Fighter anymore.

58:59.120 --> 59:05.200
Although Ryoma in our chat room says, I'll settle this right now, Street Fighter is greater

59:05.200 --> 59:07.240
than everything.

59:07.240 --> 59:11.120
There may be people that want to disagree with that, however I will say this, I am definitely

59:11.120 --> 59:15.240
looking forward to Street Fighter 2 on the Xbox Live Arcade.

59:15.240 --> 59:16.240
Loki when is that supposed to roll out?

59:16.240 --> 59:17.240
Soon right?

59:17.240 --> 59:18.240
Any day now right?

59:18.240 --> 59:19.240
We're just waiting.

59:19.240 --> 59:20.240
Is that supposed to roll out?

59:20.240 --> 59:26.120
I want to say the end of February, but probably this month at some time, probably in a couple

59:26.120 --> 59:27.120
of weeks.

59:27.120 --> 59:29.340
Damn, I want this.

59:29.340 --> 59:34.080
But you know, there's tons of demos up there now, they've got the outfit just came out

59:34.080 --> 59:39.720
on Xbox Live, you can play multiplayer online, it's actually pretty cool, and supposedly

59:39.720 --> 59:45.000
Ghost Recon Advance Warfighter is coming online at some point, and Battlefield 2 would be

59:45.000 --> 59:46.000
good.

59:46.000 --> 59:47.000
Cool.

59:47.000 --> 59:48.760
What's Nintendo cooking up, Loki?

59:48.760 --> 59:54.240
They're cooking up a new game here for the revolution, and this is actually a survivor

59:54.240 --> 59:59.680
horror game called Sadness, and Sadness is actually what's going to be unique about it

59:59.680 --> 01:00:05.000
is that it's not the sheer amount of blood that's going to creep you out, but the atmosphere

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
and the environment.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.080
It's going to be a very gothic horror type of game.

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:10.080
Cool.

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:11.640
That's a good kind of scare for me.

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:18.520
So think Silent Hill to an extent, because I know Silent Hill is pretty bloody, but definitely

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:22.720
definitely things like, for example, they'll use the revolution controller, you can use

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:29.560
it as a torch to scare away rats, or to slit the throat of somebody using the controller

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:31.480
like a shard of glass or something.

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:33.360
That's not gory at all.

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:38.240
In the game you're going to be using objects you find around you instead of guns and stuff

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:41.760
to actually survive, so that's kind of different.

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:48.360
And also, there's also a scenario that will deal with having associations of narcolepsy,

01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:55.680
necrophobia, and paranoid schizophrenia, which, by the way, kind of ties in with this other

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:58.400
thing that has to do with Nintendo.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:04.920
And that would be a patent for a sanity engine, a sanity system for a video game.

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:11.740
And it has to do with basically different, you know, computations to control, you know,

01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:15.220
the sanity of your character or, you know, like a meter for it.

01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:16.220
That actually was done.

01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:21.840
The Call of Cthulhu game had something like that, where you would start hallucinating

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:26.720
and start a- What was that GameCube game that had that?

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:27.720
Eternal Darkness?

01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:28.720
Yeah.

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:29.720
Exactly.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:31.280
So yeah, this isn't something that's new.

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:34.200
There must be a twist to it or something that we're just not getting right now until we

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:39.680
It's just something else that's just kind of cool right now. This was revolution or GameCube. I missed that. It's just a Nintendo

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:42.920
Oh, the game was for the revolution

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:43.360
Okay

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:49.260
Because I was gonna say sadness is what a lot of GameCube owners are feeling right now honestly because especially with Zelda Q

01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:54.660
Because Zelda is really the only thing left to look forward to on GameCube, right or am I like totally off parties?

01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:01.680
Come on sevens enough on it got me serious. There's really not anything killer coming out for the GameCube

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:07.220
the only other thing lined up for it is the next Zelda Twilight Princess.

01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:08.880
That's it.

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:09.880
That's it.

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:14.020
Don't get me wrong, I love me some Nintendo, but I think the GameCube is slowly fading

01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:16.700
to black, which is sad.

01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:22.100
Anyway, let's go on to another story, and you know, if you play one too many of these

01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:26.220
survival horror games, you might just start going crazy and have to go into a recovery

01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:27.220
program.

01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:31.020
But anyway, the gaming industry, there's been a suggestion on the internet lately for a

01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:34.060
recovery program of its own, correct DarkSakura?

01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:42.380
There was actually brought up a 12-step self-esteem recovery program at the game marketing conference.

01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:47.220
Now this isnít for gamers though, itís for the gaming industry, because the gaming industry

01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:51.100
has been kind of one-two punched by the government a lot lately, so.

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:57.520
So number one, promote the rating system, basically thereís a good rating system by

01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:00.700
the ESRB to make sure people know how it works.

01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:05.440
deserving of being the number one spot to evangelize the benefits of video

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:11.880
games in fact it actually references a book everything bad is good for you by

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:17.440
Steven Johnson but mom it helps my hand-eye coordination well this bringing

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:20.760
in here it's like you remember when I talked about that article that I read in

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:26.400
one of the psychology magazines last year vaguely I will just to go ahead and

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:29.920
read this out video games involve video games involve data pattern

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:33.760
and tracking multiple characters and multiple storylines, sustained

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:37.900
concentration, complex problem-solving, they're interactive, they're not passive

01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:43.640
like music or reading, there's more open-ended gameplay. Also especially with

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:47.860
puzzle games that that article that I had brought up last year was saying how

01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:51.700
those who played more video games had overall better problem-solving skills

01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:57.900
than non gamers out of their control group. Number three, do more quantitative

01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:01.580
research with leading universities to prove the positive impact of video

01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:06.460
gaming and qualify any negatives they need to share the good and the bad

01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:13.940
number four publicize that history shows we never embraced new media this is true

01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:17.460
for silent movies radio pulp magazines comic books and every new music wave

01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:21.740
including Mozart video games are not the devil incarnate and not capable of half

01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:25.740
the devil tree our critics claim for them that's that's a quote from there by

01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:30.540
the way number five preach moderation and promote good parenting remind

01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:34.540
parents moderation and all things including video games is important

01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:39.500
you're responsible as parents to oversee this amen sorry what side is this coming

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:48.660
from this is actually from next from next generation cool yes this is pretty

01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:53.780
cool it's pretty smart yep six benchmark against sex and violence and prime TV

01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:58.780
Prime Network TV and movies. I don't think video games have cornered the market on sex and violence. Amen

01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:05.100
I think it's funny that they showed a slide of David David Hasselhoff in a speedo. Are they suggesting that the

01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:12.980
gaming industry run essentially like a like like a political ad smear campaign would be try to run a campaign that says

01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:18.460
Games are not as evil as movies. That's kind of how I read that is that keep in mind that

01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:25.820
Is watching the the news how many violent acts do you see or hear about just watching the news true?

01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:28.740
But the politicians are trying to say that's all because of games

01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:36.820
Again the facts are there crime has been in crime among youth has been in decline. Mm-hmm

01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:41.380
You don't believe me ask the Department of Justice. The numbers are there. All right

01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:48.180
7. Embrace the Constitution. We have a right in this industry to make and market our product

01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:52.900
in an unregulated manner. We should be talking about what our rights are. Video games are

01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:58.020
part art and part commerce. Both parts are protected.

01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:02.820
8. Lobby. Make political donations. Okay. That...

01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:04.620
Interest... Okay.

01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:13.060
Well, with other industries, if McDonald's can lobby not to subsidize the cost of produce

01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:18.500
to low-income families, then why can't video games do the same?

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:23.180
It's like how we suggested a while back when a lot of gamers were mad at Konami over the

01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:24.180
future of DDR.

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:28.420
We said, buy stock in Konami, be a shareholder, and tell them what you want the future of

01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:29.420
the company to be.

01:06:29.420 --> 01:06:31.860
It's kind of the legal way of buying stock in a politician.

01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:33.180
Yeah

01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:37.300
Kind of sad though that we have that capability is a strange comparison

01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:42.540
But anyway nine harness our best spokespeople have them talk about why they like video games

01:06:43.220 --> 01:06:45.960
Have basically using high-profile celebrities

01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:52.660
Benefits, you know just to bring different people in by seeing their favorite, you know

01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:56.300
Stars say oh, I like this game. No sadly enough

01:06:56.300 --> 01:07:00.940
I don't want to mention this because I really hate the idea anyways, but you have the hip-hop gaming league

01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:07.540
I mean, most people, I wouldn't see them as, you know, really someone to focus on, you

01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:11.340
know, being the spokesperson for games, but you've got celebrities in that, you know,

01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:16.620
like Snoop Dogg and stuff, also like basketball and, you know, sports celebrities that are

01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:21.340
playing games and they have their own kind of mini league that they cover on their website.

01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:24.340
Might be something good.

01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:27.420
Number 10 was demonstrate the most creative games.

01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:31.240
Halo and Grand Theft Auto represent us in the marketplace, but we need to show people

01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:33.460
it's not all about guns and boobs.

01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:37.820
Katamari Damacy, DDR, Parappa, Donkey Konga, and Guitar Heroes are all games the whole

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:40.460
family can enjoy and play.

01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:43.660
But a little guitar, or I'm sorry, a little guitar, a little violence and boobs never

01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:44.660
hurt anyone.

01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:45.660
No.

01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:46.660
I still think we need air guitar frees.

01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:47.660
Over 18.

01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:48.660
Hooray for boobies.

01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:51.300
That was a good album.

01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:52.780
It was Bloodhound Gang.

01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:56.020
I'm not that retarded when it comes to pop culture anyway.

01:07:56.020 --> 01:07:57.020
11.

01:07:57.020 --> 01:08:04.220
In statistical perspective less than 20% of all games released are M rated a minority of the product good point

01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:09.820
Amen 12 be proud don't be ashamed to say you like video games. Just be sure to tell people why you like them

01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:15.500
You know you know I don't like that I run into this all the time at work

01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:20.140
You know I tell people that yeah, I do this thing on the internet about video games. They're kind of like oh

01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:29.020
oh really like oh you're you're like that huh i'm sorry to hear that i do you know what's weird

01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:34.780
i get more of a reaction from telling someone i'm a gamer than telling them i'm gay honestly i do

01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:38.860
like you know i tell somebody at work i'm gay and they go oh okay yeah yeah we all knew that

01:08:38.860 --> 01:08:43.180
and then you know i tell somebody that i'm a gamer like oh wow you you you play games

01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:54.300
Crazy, crazy. It's the culture. I am a proud gamer. Amen. And you know what, there should

01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:58.840
be a number 13 on there. If you're female, tell the boys to piss off if they say you

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:03.880
can't play a video game. There you go. Or just beat them to shit. Yeah, you take those

01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:11.040
platform boots and knock them upside the head. You heard that from me. Alright, let's go.

01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:12.600
That was a very good top 12.

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:16.120
Next generations I came from, I tip my hat to that website.

01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:17.120
Very nice.

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:18.120
I think it's next-gen.com.

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:19.120
Very cool.

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:21.280
I've got a story here.

01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:24.520
We're trying to wrap up this first half of the show here, but plenty more stories to

01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:25.520
come here.

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:27.960
I want to talk about GameTap real quick.

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:34.220
GameTap is now going to be offering previews and trailers on their service.

01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:39.040
It's kind of like a try before you buy type thing, but they recently signed an agreement

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:45.720
with Strategy First, who made Galactic Civilizations, and this will allow customers to preview full

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:48.120
versions of their pre-release titles.

01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:54.040
Sounds to me a little bit like the Xbox Live model, a little bit like the demos, but a

01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:58.080
very interesting way for the PC publishers and GameTap to find that harmony.

01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:01.080
Hey, I'm all for easy access to game demos.

01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:05.280
I think it's a great idea, so I tip my hat to GameTap as well.

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:06.680
Lots of smart people in gaming this week.

01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:08.200
This is good news.

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:12.240
All right, let's go to the next story which is from Loki

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:19.960
Yes, let's talk a little bit about Xbox and the patch systems. Gotta love the way they patch games. I

01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:24.960
Hate it. I think it's a dumb idea the release games that aren't ready for you know

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:30.160
The market because they have bugs and they do it knowingly that they have that these errors in the games

01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:36.880
For example dead or alive 4 there's a mandatory patch that's fixing bugs and adding no new content coming soon

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:43.920
It's also going to you know help balance some of the characters, but basically the fix the save bug yay, and that's something great

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:49.920
Oh guess what you know those demo kiosks out there that you could download the Xbox car for burnout

01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:53.900
Guess what it doesn't work. It doesn't work at all because

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:59.840
It's broken. Yes. That's right. EA has actually said there's at right now

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:04.920
There's no official date of the patch, but there will be one to fix the 360 kiosk car

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:12.160
because it doesn't work. Very fun. Another thing, Ghost Recon Advanced

01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:16.520
Warfighter is going to be getting an update soon to add the Southpaw

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:22.760
controller configuration and to fix the bugs in their save system that caused

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:27.240
your save game to get deleted just like it did in full auto and in Call of Duty

01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:33.400
2. My question is why are they releasing all these games out there if it's

01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:38.180
constantly if these games aren't ready I mean for example even some of the

01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:43.460
patches are causing 360 systems to freeze up it's just ridiculous seriously

01:11:43.460 --> 01:11:48.540
why is it that they're releasing these games out there if they're not ready for

01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:53.220
the market if you know they're kind of using the patch system as an excuse to

01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:57.400
get everything out there and so now we're basically you know held hostage to

01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:04.400
to it. I don't like it. What do you guys think?

01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:07.440
I definitely don't think that people should be releasing games that are only

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:10.440
like half finished and I don't think patching is the way to

01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:13.920
like fix your game on the back end but at the same time I do realize that the

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:16.080
occasional error is going to come up in testing

01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:20.160
or I mean the occasional error is going to come up that people don't find

01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:23.240
like you know people that find loopholes and stuff and like let's say they didn't

01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:24.880
know about this whole full auto

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:28.800
people quitting make fucks up your life stats and what have you I I'm okay with

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:31.480
them you know releasing patches to pick things like this in fact I don't think

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:33.760
enough companies release patches sometimes

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:37.000
to fix these bugs that are discovered but I I

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:41.280
definitely agree that patches should never be the excuse for getting a game

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:43.600
out on time is that all we can always patch it later

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:47.280
here's a here's a perfect example King Kong didn't have any gamma

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:50.960
adjustments to the game the game was too damn dark to play

01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:55.880
mean come on that tell that screams oh we didn't test this on a normal TV we

01:12:55.880 --> 01:13:00.800
just used our LCD monitors that we have here at work it looked fine on that God

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:06.000
that's just lazy extremely lazy and then they have to go back and fix that it's

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:11.360
so stupid what can we do about it what we can do about is have these people you

01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:15.480
know with your wallet they need to take their time before releasing these games

01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:19.280
I my big gripe was with EA a lot of times because they release these games

01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:25.100
are just slightly better than the current gen console stuff, and yet people buy them

01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:27.880
like me because I'm a sucker and I will buy Burnout.

01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:33.940
But still though, a lot of times we don't know that these bugs are there until after

01:13:33.940 --> 01:13:34.940
you buy the game.

01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:38.600
It's like you play all the way through Call of Duty and all of a sudden, oop, my save

01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:39.600
game's gone.

01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:42.900
Hmm, that's a nice bonus feature that wasn't mentioned on the box art.

01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:47.980
So I don't know, I like the idea of patching it to fix stuff and maybe add content later

01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:48.980
on.

01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:54.140
as an excuse to release a game like Call of Duty 2, whose online multiplayer sucks ass

01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:59.580
because there's so much lag on it, and they obviously didn't test it.

01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:06.820
Alright, well, if you have a response to Loki's little rant, you could always send us an email,

01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:10.320
and that was sent to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:12.200
We love to hear from you guys.

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:16.800
Every week Dark Soccer likes to go into our mailbag and stick her hand in the mailbag

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:19.120
and dig out her favorite letters.

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:22.120
And that is mailbag with a B, not hag with an H.

01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:23.120
Mailhag?

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:26.080
Is Dark Sakura a mailhag?

01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:27.180
Just teasing.

01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:29.120
I say that I tease because I love.

01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:30.240
That disturbs me.

01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:31.240
Don't give me evil glares.

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:34.400
I didn't give you an evil glare, it was a disturbed look.

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:37.840
Alright, Dark Sakura likes to dig into the mailbag, she's going to do that right now.

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:38.840
With a shovel.

01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:40.280
Are you all sanitized and ready to go?

01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:43.600
I've got the hazmat suit.

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:48.360
Who emailed us this week?

01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:50.840
Lots of people, because I'm popular.

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:51.840
Sweet!

01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:52.840
Attention rocks!

01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:57.720
Actually, our good buddy Roble pointed out a few things.

01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:04.840
That basically, not only is Xbox getting in all over the 360 thing, we now have 360.yahoo.com,

01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:12.260
we have the Colgate 360, and we have Anderson Cooper 360 on CNN.

01:15:12.260 --> 01:15:14.460
That is a brilliant observation.

01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:20.460
We need to launch Orange Launch Radio 360.

01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:22.260
Maybe that can be the name of our fan club.

01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:24.740
Oh, speaking of fan clubs, can I plug the new MySpace?

01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:28.060
Yes, as someone didn't do in our LiveJournal community either.

01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:29.060
Sorry, my bad.

01:15:29.060 --> 01:15:30.060
We have a new MySpace.

01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:31.060
It's brand new.

01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:32.060
It's different from the group.

01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:34.540
We had a fan that made a group, but now we have an actual user account.

01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:37.220
Like we're a band because we want to be rock stars.

01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:40.100
But you can actually listen to clips from old shows.

01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:43.620
And you remember Jaime's email from last week where she was pointing out all the good clips

01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:44.620
from older shows?

01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:45.620
Yeah.

01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:47.860
I actually put the Mega Man clip on our MySpace.

01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:52.060
So that's www.myspace.com slash orange lounge radio.

01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:56.320
Yes, we know MySpace is where the internet goes to die, but if we can promote ourselves

01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:57.780
on it, hey, we'll sell our souls to MySpace.

01:15:57.780 --> 01:16:03.180
I was actually listening to that the other day and just cracking up and my husband thought

01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:06.020
that I had gone nuts.

01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:10.060
The freaky part about Myspace is Fox is now using it to promote their TV shows.

01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:11.060
I'm not surprised.

01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:12.060
Which is lame.

01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:14.700
I mean, well Myspace itself is lame.

01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:19.300
Well they own it, so why not check it out, Myspace.com slash orange lounge radio and

01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:21.500
add us because we want like a zillion friends.

01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:23.140
Alright, sorry to interrupt.

01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:27.100
We got an email from DJ Ratchet.

01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:32.620
Basically just to go into if he wanted to thank us for reading the email in the last

01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:37.820
podcast but also asked a question about Kingdom Hearts 2 which actually did

01:16:37.820 --> 01:16:44.980
reply to about the different summons wanting to know if chicken little was in

01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:49.100
the game chicken little has been confirmed as a summon in Kingdom Hearts

01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:54.780
2 just thought I'd let you know you know what I actually should be playing more

01:16:54.780 --> 01:16:59.980
Kingdom Hearts 2 but I have this issue with playing games in Japanese I can do

01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:03.700
it but then reading I have to sit there with my dictionary and try to translate

01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:09.460
the kanji and it gives me a headache so she said dick hey sorry I had to do that

01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:15.700
I say dick all the time dick dick dick dick dick dick dick I'm sorry maybe we

01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:19.220
should just cut that little clip and put that on our myspace I'll be good all

01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:25.460
right moving on dick dick why am I not thinking of that scene in space balls

01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:34.700
just just do I have to separate you two next up okay we have an email from and I

01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:42.620
have to scroll down to see who this from psychoon hi um this is about uh you know

01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:46.980
old school games is a big fan of the old school games like in the gameplay but

01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:53.860
lots of people out there are saying graphics over the games so I know it's

01:17:53.860 --> 01:17:58.140
like they're saying oh this game sucks because it doesn't look pretty that's

01:17:58.140 --> 01:18:05.140
stupid uh let's see what can I a case in point geometry Wars well it's it's

01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:09.260
pretty too geometry Wars is a pretty game but it's not it's not exactly

01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:14.220
pushing the 360s hardware to its limits radio ever gone yet it's insane thank

01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:19.940
you then again so is Ikaruga and that was really graphically pretty you know

01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:29.020
once in a while you can still pull up an old Atari 2600 classic on like GameTap or emulators

01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:31.180
or whatever you want to use, and they're still fun.

01:18:31.180 --> 01:18:33.140
Unless it's ET because that game sucked.

01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:36.740
Well, yeah, but they don't have ET on GameTap and I don't think they exist.

01:18:36.740 --> 01:18:38.900
I think Atari's pretty much written ET off.

01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:39.900
I have two.

01:18:39.900 --> 01:18:40.900
Sucker.

01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:41.900
Yeah.

01:18:41.900 --> 01:18:42.900
I didn't buy them.

01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:43.900
Did I?

01:18:43.900 --> 01:18:44.900
I was.

01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:49.340
But just to go ahead and read a paragraph out of this letter, it said I just want to

01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:54.340
to know why as many people now think that graphics are more important to a game than

01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:58.740
gameplay. I actually played Sonic Adventure with a friend of mine and he complained about

01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:02.720
how blocky it looked to him as compared to Half Life 2 and Halo 2 and he didn't like

01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:06.920
it just for that reason although Sonic Adventure was, still is, a great game.

01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:10.740
Well he was comparing first version to 2. I mean Sonic Adventure 2 wasn't as...

01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:15.620
First of all I want to know how was Sonic Adventure blocky? Sonic Adventure was really

01:19:15.620 --> 01:19:19.780
smooth, very nice. I don't think, I can't think of any games on Dreamcast that were

01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:24.660
blocky at all. No, not since like the early Playstation games and even then it's like

01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:29.260
who cares, one of my favorite games ever on Playstation is called Evil Zone and it's really

01:19:29.260 --> 01:19:34.580
horrible looking but it's so cheese ball we want to make fun of every anime in existence.

01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:40.780
Well it's just spoiled by next gen pretty stuff, you know? You know, people, I think

01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:45.940
I think it's just because we grew up, you know, with the we-have-nothing-but gameplay,

01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:46.940
you know?

01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:50.900
That we have a better appreciation for a game that plays well versus a game that looks pretty

01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:52.140
and plays like crap.

01:19:52.140 --> 01:19:55.500
Half-Life 2 plays well.

01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:56.500
Don't get, don't get, I think...

01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:57.500
I can't play first person.

01:19:57.500 --> 01:20:01.100
Halo's a pretty game, and it's a good game, don't get me wrong, but you know, don't knock

01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:06.540
Sonic Adventure just because, you know, it's not pristine quality like these games, like

01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:07.700
you kids have now.

01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:14.140
I will have to get off our game the US Sonic Adventure actually was a little bit better because the Japanese one had so many

01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:16.940
Glitches in it. Like I ran in I ran through a wall and got stuck in it

01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:22.980
Actually, technically I got a camera in a wall. Yeah, the sonic team camera had it has issues still

01:20:23.780 --> 01:20:25.940
in another dreamcast game

01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:32.020
Blue stinger I had the Japanese version where they'd had the big cinematic, you know camera angles

01:20:32.020 --> 01:20:38.600
It's really hard to do that scene where you're climbing up the tower when the camera is like 50 miles above the tower

01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:42.480
Like oh yay. I'm going to pretend. I know where I'm going

01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:50.880
So next letter shy sure another one from Rob about Lieberman being the porker of the month

01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:54.480
Like fatty, I don't know

01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:57.840
Why did he get shot in the face too?

01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:01.040
Basically, there's an article on a game spot

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:07.080
that are there proposing the CDC investigate video games you know what

01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:15.520
disease control let me I'm sure this Katamari game made me lose my mind and

01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:19.480
I've just gone crazy and I worship the king of all cosmos they want to look at

01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:24.200
the impact of electronic media use organized by the Centers for Disease

01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:28.440
Control and Prevention to go ahead and read a little bit of this article even

01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:32.560
of the legislation called the Children and Media Research Advancement Act does not include

01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:37.080
restrictions and appears to be intended as a way to justify them. That's because a string

01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:42.560
of court decisions have been striking down anti-gaming laws because of a lack of hard

01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:46.120
evidence that minors are harmed by violence in video games.

01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:50.600
I'm sorry to take that out on anyone. Your tax dollars at work, ladies and gentlemen.

01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:56.460
As like, they can't admit that they're wrong. They've, you know, how many times have we

01:21:56.460 --> 01:22:00.580
seen all of you know the courts basically upholding what we've been

01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:04.740
saying for ages that there's not really any type of major harm to come to it

01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:08.780
unless you're counting home environment but they're saying no no it's a video

01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:16.860
games parents are not allowed to raise their children stupid people why is it

01:22:16.860 --> 01:22:22.700
that you know I'm not even gonna go into it every I think really program I think

01:22:22.700 --> 01:22:27.460
everybody knows by now how I feel about our government's hand and things so I'm

01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:31.340
gonna skip on to the next letter how's that sound? Sounds super. We have an email

01:22:31.340 --> 01:22:37.580
from Max in Melbourne. Okay. And actually this has to do with something Loki

01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:43.140
talked about the Infinium Labs console, the Phantom. Wanted to add something in

01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:47.740
here I'll go ahead and read this. Best name ever for vaporware. Like

01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:48.740
Melbourne, Australia?

01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:49.740
Yes.

01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:50.740
Sweet.

01:22:50.740 --> 01:22:53.020
I'm going to go ahead and quote from here.

01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:54.860
I would like to add a bit to what he said.

01:22:54.860 --> 01:23:01.020
The company spent around $62 million on stuff for the last year with around $3.5 million

01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:03.440
spent on the actual console development.

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:06.240
This may be because the console is a scam.

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:10.600
You see what the console makers or non-makers in this case could be doing is just getting

01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:14.140
lots of money from investors to say they're going to make a console when they actually

01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:17.580
spend very little on the console and keep some of the money for themselves.

01:23:17.580 --> 01:23:21.940
For example, they hire their family as consultants, pay them $200,000 a year while also paying

01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:24.340
themselves money.

01:23:24.340 --> 01:23:26.540
If you ask me, quite a good idea, really.

01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:29.580
And Orange Launch Radio will be coming out with its own console very soon and we're looking

01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:30.580
for investors.

01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:33.260
So if you have $11 billion, please send us an email.

01:23:33.260 --> 01:23:36.180
Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com, we'd love to hear from you.

01:23:36.180 --> 01:23:43.340
I remember when they were showing the Phantom at U3, was it in 2004, and they had a booth

01:23:43.340 --> 01:23:47.420
and they were like, you know, I tried to go in the wrong exit or wrong entrance or something

01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:51.420
and it got all pissed off at me or something, so then I walked around the normal way and

01:23:51.420 --> 01:23:59.980
then I saw their console that sucked balls and then I wish we were TV sometimes, I wish

01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:06.780
we were TV sometimes because Loki was doing little quotes there, quote finger balls, anyways,

01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:12.620
quotes around sucked, so yeah and I got a free t-shirt out of it though that glows in

01:24:12.620 --> 01:24:17.020
the dark and sadly enough, does it suck balls, I got a phantom t-shirt and used it to clean

01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:23.100
the bathroom t-shirt sucks um no the only thing i liked about the console was the case and i wanted

01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:28.220
to make a computer out of the case that was about it because it had this like glowing blue light on

01:24:28.220 --> 01:24:37.340
the front and that looked cool but other than that it was like huge it was the size of a large vcr i

01:24:37.340 --> 01:24:44.060
mean this thing was ginormous it looked like a stupid brick any more emails one more one more

01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:45.060
Alrighty.

01:24:45.060 --> 01:24:46.060
From Jaded.

01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:47.060
Hi, Jaded.

01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:51.940
There's an interesting article that he wants us to look at about, it's actually something

01:24:51.940 --> 01:24:55.500
on Slashdot.

01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:58.780
It's actually a really, really quick little article, so I'm just going to read what it

01:24:58.780 --> 01:24:59.780
says.

01:24:59.780 --> 01:25:00.780
Sure.

01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:01.780
Okay.

01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:12.340
Kotaku has a great feature up today written by James Wagner, formerly embedded reporter

01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:16.520
for him in the world of Second Life. He's now doing his own thing and he's got a

01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:20.640
fairly cynical discussion over the Kotaku site about the real purpose

01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:26.440
behind game previews in industry magazines. From the article, and this is a

01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:30.720
quote, but for the thing of it is, game magazine previews are almost uniformly

01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:34.920
positive even for the most undistinguished titles, so it unrolls

01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:40.680
thus. Publisher makes mediocre game, press reviews, I'm sorry, press previews depict

01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:45.320
mediocre game as being good or at least worth a look. Excited gamers read

01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:49.040
previews foolishly believe them start making pre-sale orders of mediocre games

01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:53.360
driven by preview press and pre-sale numbers based on that press. Retailers

01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:56.560
stock up on mediocre games publisher makes money from mediocre games and

01:25:56.560 --> 01:26:01.280
keeps producing more games like it. Hey Yola. Let's see maybe if we add on to

01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:07.840

lounge radio calm Loki take us out of this hour you have some follow-ups some

01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:33.320
quickie little follow-ups to things we were bitching about last week yeah the

01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:37.720
first thing is if you're hoping for another NFL game by someone other than

01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:45.320
than EA sorry NFL extended the CBA and EA still holds exclusive rights to the

01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:51.600
NFL sorry and I kind of saw that coming yeah anyways the origami what is the

01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:58.200
origami it is a 7-inch tablet PC that runs Windows and it's gonna be under

01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:05.640
$1,000 only yeah is it a gaming system no it's not a gaming system it's more

01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:10.440
like a micro laptop type thing mine sweeper on the go hello

01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:14.280
actually and they will they did and there is a video file

01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:17.500
out on YouTube I love you to I'm

01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:20.640
where someone apparently leaked one of the their marketing

01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:24.120
demos I'll that they were showing during their little meetings

01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:27.860
and it did so somebody actually playing a game on it well see really that was in

01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:30.240
a market it was on their viral site that they had

01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:34.000
I'm or origami project dot com and

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:40.740
It was just a concept proof of concept it wasn't actually weren't actually playing a video or a game like because it was showing

01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:46.700
Halo 2 and it was but then they would listen it there as a potential for the machine dark Tetsuya in our chat room says

01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:53.540
999 99 when you say under $1,000 that mean 999 dollars 99 cents. I'm a likely probably they're gonna sell it for

01:27:54.460 --> 01:28:00.620
$666 they have three different versions of the well, it's not even really the origami. It's like I

01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:07.460
I think it was called now it's the like PC and like mini PC or something like

01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:13.580
that I forget how they were calling them it's basically just this really small

01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:22.340
PC that's about it all right any other follow-ups no all right then I think I

01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:25.900
think we're finally due for a break our first hour is turned into our first hour

01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:29.580
and a half segment but that's okay we're just in a chatty mood tonight I guess

01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:32.900
Who knows?

01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:36.860
