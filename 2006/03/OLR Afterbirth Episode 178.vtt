WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.360
Alright, we're back here with the Afterbirth, and you know, I think this might be one of

00:11.360 --> 00:15.120
the longest shows on the records for us here at Orange Laundry.

00:15.120 --> 00:18.360
We're almost already to 9 o'clock, so kind of interesting.

00:18.360 --> 00:21.600
Alright, so we've got a lot of stuff we want to cover here in the Afterbirth.

00:21.600 --> 00:24.320
Let's go ahead and start off with a little bit of how was your week, how was your day,

00:24.320 --> 00:27.440
really quickly go around and see what's going on in our personal lives.

00:27.440 --> 00:32.320
Remember, the afterbirth, this is the portion that is absolutely dearly special to those

00:32.320 --> 00:34.340
of you guys listening live here on OrangeLawnsRadio.com.

00:34.340 --> 00:36.020
We don't podcast it.

00:36.020 --> 00:37.420
In fact, some people bootleg it.

00:37.420 --> 00:38.860
I don't know why.

00:38.860 --> 00:39.860
We don't talk about games at all.

00:39.860 --> 00:41.100
We talk about us.

00:41.100 --> 00:42.100
What's going on?

00:42.100 --> 00:44.660
DarkSakura, how was your week, how was your day?

00:44.660 --> 00:49.500
Being the diva that I am, I slept until noon today and then went to the grocery store.

00:49.500 --> 00:54.260
Other than that, I sprained my wrist last Friday, which I might have mentioned on the

00:54.260 --> 01:01.260
the show because my cat was being a retard and I was leaning over to pet her

01:01.260 --> 01:06.740
and balancing myself on the the chair as I was getting up and she bumped into my

01:06.740 --> 01:10.880
leg not me just enough off balance so my wrist is a little sore now it's actually

01:10.880 --> 01:14.260
better but I couldn't play anything all week except Ragnarok it really got on my

01:14.260 --> 01:21.300
nerves however you know I did play a lot of Ragnarok I also I have homework that

01:21.300 --> 01:28.500
I've been putting off all week that I didn't do today. Good job. Yeah, I'm really responsible.

01:28.500 --> 01:33.680
So it's going to be turned in late. And, uh, really that's about it. I've just had a very

01:33.680 --> 01:39.240
busy week. All right. Uh, Xtaphir, how was your week? How was your day? Uh, the week

01:39.240 --> 01:47.060
was fine. I, um, I was sick a couple days out of the week, but it's, it's already passed

01:47.060 --> 01:54.940
and everything. I went back to Final Fantasy XI after you guys all went back and I decided

01:54.940 --> 01:59.100
okay well I'll try a different character. So I'm not a white mage anymore and I'm not

01:59.100 --> 02:06.900
a black mage anymore, I'm a thief. So yay, thieves. Because you know what, I play a rogue

02:06.900 --> 02:12.140
in World of Warcraft and it's pretty much the same thing. Anyways, and then today I

02:12.140 --> 02:15.560
had a good time with my boyfriend, actually I had a really good time with my boyfriend

02:15.560 --> 02:24.440
whole weekend and yay shut up and we went into the video games live on friday which was cool so yeah

02:25.320 --> 02:34.120
so yay boyfriend loki how was your week how was your day um my week is okay um

02:35.560 --> 02:41.960
what did i do this week shit um well now i don't think i did anything too important i did play

02:41.960 --> 02:48.720
more oblivion. That was fun. And tomorrow I'm supposed to be going to get a marriage

02:48.720 --> 02:54.400
license, and so I'm actually taking the day off, and that's only gonna take about half

02:54.400 --> 02:59.040
an hour, but I have to drive up to Placerville, and that's like, what, like an hour, not an

02:59.040 --> 03:04.120
hour away, but like 30 minutes away. And no one likes going to Placerville, it's like,

03:04.120 --> 03:07.040
you know, I don't...

03:07.040 --> 03:10.040
It's just not allowed there. There's not a lot there.

03:13.040 --> 03:16.040
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

03:18.040 --> 03:21.040
Oh, and of course we went down to San Jose and that was fun.

03:21.040 --> 03:23.040
And that was really cool.

03:25.040 --> 03:28.040
Now I gotta mention though, when we were at Genji,

03:28.040 --> 03:32.040
it is basically your Benihana's type of restaurant.

03:32.040 --> 03:33.040
It's a teppanyaki.

03:33.040 --> 03:35.360
Yeah, where they, you know, cook in front of you.

03:35.360 --> 03:36.360
But they did...

03:36.360 --> 03:40.520
Benny Hana's does this thing where they make, like, a volcano out of the onions.

03:40.520 --> 03:46.720
Now Genji took it one step further that put them on top, as far as the onion section goes,

03:46.720 --> 03:47.720
with me.

03:47.720 --> 03:51.660
And that would be that they took the onion, and they made a little volcano, and they poured

03:51.660 --> 03:54.720
the water in there, and then it caused the scene, ooh, a volcano.

03:54.720 --> 04:00.040
Well then he took, you know, alcohol, poured the alcohol in there, and lit it on fire.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.940
And that was freaking sweet.

04:01.940 --> 04:05.420
They do that at another place in town called Katana.

04:05.420 --> 04:08.020
Well, I don't care.

04:08.020 --> 04:14.520
Wow. This is just cool.

04:14.520 --> 04:17.500
Other than that, no, I didn't do too much else.

04:17.500 --> 04:22.180
My week and my day was okay. I was still really sick this week

04:22.180 --> 04:25.020
with my sinus infection. It just kind of kept me down for a little while and I didn't

04:25.020 --> 04:27.460
really get to go to the gym at all, which kind of pissed me off, but

04:27.460 --> 04:31.020
I'm better now. Yesterday was my first day with zero meds, zero anything, so I

04:31.020 --> 04:37.100
feel much better now thank you very much and otherwise just been try been doing a

04:37.100 --> 04:40.300
lot of gaming because you know just everything on the 360 and the DS and

04:40.300 --> 04:47.300
Final Fantasy and all that stuff good times and I guess I Tuesday we already

04:47.300 --> 04:51.540
pretty much talked about that was a great night and put down my DS X4 what

04:51.540 --> 05:03.140
doing no what are you playing extra for I think Tetris alright dork alright

05:03.140 --> 05:10.740
anyway I'm great radio let's go ahead and go to a segment oh here extra I'll

05:10.740 --> 05:13.320
put you on the spot because you want to do a movie review so now you gotta put

05:13.320 --> 05:19.080
it down haha I got you alright extra for wants to do a movie review tonight so

05:19.080 --> 05:26.080
So Extrofer, what did you, oh wait, oh wait, I almost forgot. Sorry. I have to get your theme music.

05:26.080 --> 05:27.080
Oh god.

05:27.080 --> 05:31.080
Extrofer's movie review! What movie did you see this week?

05:31.080 --> 05:33.080
V for Vendetta.

05:33.080 --> 05:35.080
Alright, how was it?

05:35.080 --> 05:43.080
And it was very well done. I really liked it. First of all, when we went into the theater I was really wanting to see the Snakes on a Plane preview.

05:43.080 --> 05:48.300
because you know that's just really funny but um and I also want to get the

05:48.300 --> 05:52.860
t-shirt that has the snakes and then plus plane equals snakes on okay when I

05:52.860 --> 05:56.900
mentioned snakes on the plane to you you were like what is that that's stupid

05:56.900 --> 06:03.900
well I still think it's stupid I think everybody yeah yeah and I want to see it

06:03.900 --> 06:11.420
now but the movie itself it was really well done it really has a lot of

06:11.420 --> 06:18.380
important issues in it that I think kind of pertain to today's current events and

06:18.380 --> 06:22.520
everything and I think everybody should see it I think it's better than the

06:22.520 --> 06:25.940
matrix is from the people who brought out the matrix and I wasn't a big fan of

06:25.940 --> 06:30.500
the matrix but I really liked this movie a lot I think it's one of the best

06:30.500 --> 06:36.820
movies I've seen this year two thumbs up yeah two big dicks up all right thank

06:36.820 --> 06:48.760
you. Two snakes up. All right. Let's see. I mentioned there on the Skype line earlier.

06:48.760 --> 06:53.240
Well first off, we're going to open it back up very soon here, but on the Skype line earlier,

06:53.240 --> 06:57.480
we told one of our callers that we would actually take a look at this live on air. So I'm going

06:57.480 --> 07:04.260
to try and pull this up here. Let's see if I can locate the file. It says MTV. Okay,

07:04.260 --> 07:06.660
Here we go, so this is that MTV interview.

07:06.660 --> 07:09.220
We haven't done Orange Lawn's Radio at the Movies in a long time.

07:09.220 --> 07:13.400
So we have this MTV interview with Sketch, who's a DDR player.

07:13.400 --> 07:16.760
Keep in mind, usually when we do Orange Lawn's Radio at the Movies, we have a chance to watch

07:16.760 --> 07:20.480
this clip in advance and kind of prep what we want to say, but tonight, not the case.

07:20.480 --> 07:22.140
So we're just going to watch this to see how it goes.

07:22.140 --> 07:23.140
So here it is.

07:23.140 --> 07:26.860
Dance Dance Revolution expert Anthony spends insane hours training for tournaments like

07:26.860 --> 07:28.300
the one we're about to show you.

07:28.300 --> 07:31.860
Now kids, I'm warning you, you try this at home and you're going to watch your knees

07:31.860 --> 07:33.800
buckle and your ankles snap.

07:33.800 --> 07:37.800
Now wait, hold on a minute. Isn't DDR something that's designed to be played at home?

07:37.800 --> 07:41.800
Kids! I'm gonna warn ya! I'm stupid!

07:41.800 --> 07:45.800
Okay, well I'm guessing that he's saying that because this guy

07:45.800 --> 07:49.800
is going to do some insane tricks here. Guys, I apologize for the volume on this video

07:49.800 --> 07:53.800
but the video volume is insanely low. I have it jacked up as high as it'll go, so

07:53.800 --> 07:57.800
you'll just have to deal here for a little bit. Anyway, let's move on. Let's see what is so

07:57.800 --> 08:01.800
frickin' insane about this.

08:01.800 --> 08:15.680
bar-humping

08:15.680 --> 08:19.400
well yes kids kids do not allow yourselves to bar rape at home because

08:19.400 --> 08:22.200
that's what they're doing in this little clip right now is they're bar raping

08:22.200 --> 08:26.680
because they don't rape the couch bar raping by the way for you non DDR folks

08:26.680 --> 08:30.280
it's when you hold on to the bar while you play which is not dancing

08:30.280 --> 08:33.600
I'm sorry that's not dancing. Well neither is DDR technically. Well I know.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.720
But you know what, when you play doubles and some of that freestyle stuff you see now

08:36.720 --> 08:38.600
that's dancing. Bar raping is not dancing.

08:38.600 --> 08:45.600
Anyway moving on. For most of us Dance Dance Revolution is something you do for fun.

08:45.760 --> 08:50.560
But for Anthony Carella here, the New York City DDR champion, quite possibly the best in the world,

08:50.560 --> 08:54.280
this is really serious business. Seriously. I bet about,

08:54.280 --> 08:57.760
no offense to this guy, I don't know him, but I bet there's about 50 people on the

08:57.760 --> 08:59.280
internet waiting to dispute this claim.

08:59.280 --> 09:02.600
and you know that there's people jealous that this guy got TV time

09:02.600 --> 09:05.680
we know what it's not like you know she's

09:05.680 --> 09:09.120
MTV doing actual research on something

09:09.120 --> 09:12.360
now yeah okay anyway I am in no and I'm not gonna doubt this guy's good I've

09:12.360 --> 09:15.180
never seen I'm just gonna say there are going to be 50 people lined up

09:15.180 --> 09:21.180
wanting to dispute that claim that's all I'm saying

09:21.180 --> 09:25.080
I just started playing about four years ago

09:25.080 --> 09:28.520
I found like solace in the game because I had a breakup with my girlfriend

09:28.520 --> 09:32.920
And it's a dick thing, man. I can't stop playing. I just love playing it.

09:32.920 --> 09:36.600
Okay, I'm sorry. That's lame. He's playing. Not his reasoning.

09:36.600 --> 09:39.720
They made him play DDR while he's being interviewed. That is

09:39.720 --> 09:42.760
that is the ultimate in cheeseball. I'm sorry. Really stupid.

09:42.760 --> 09:46.200
Whoever attributed MTV with doing anything really intelligent

09:46.200 --> 09:49.880
other than remote control. Sometimes me and my friends would wake up at nine

09:49.880 --> 09:52.360
o'clock, go down to Coney Island, play all day.

09:52.360 --> 09:55.400
Go home at eight o'clock, wake up, do it again. We would do it for about a week.

09:55.400 --> 10:01.000
it usually runs me not even gonna lie about 20 to 40 bucks every time i go to the arcade

10:02.440 --> 10:05.880
which by the way you'll notice this guy is one of the skinniest people i've ever seen in my

10:05.880 --> 10:11.880
life and that's why right there that is a look at that he is skinny very very skinny

10:13.720 --> 10:19.640
from about 2003 to 2004 i was undefeated in all new york city fair options tournaments

10:19.640 --> 10:23.080
Yeah, that's because you're on the East Coast.

10:23.080 --> 10:26.880
Oh! Burned. I'm just teasing.

10:26.880 --> 10:30.320
Here comes all the hate mail from the East Coast. This guy, you asshole.

10:30.320 --> 10:33.720
I'm teasing. It's a joke. I'm just starting shit.

10:33.720 --> 10:38.600
I take pride in saying that I'm one of the few people, if not the only person in the world, that can stealth

10:38.600 --> 10:43.360
every hard 10-footer in the game backwards. Meaning I could do it without looking or I could turn the arrows on.

10:43.360 --> 10:47.520
Well, let me put it this way. If you can stealth it going forward, you can stealth it backwards.

10:47.520 --> 10:49.520
Sorry, I restarted the video.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.800
No, sorry.

10:51.800 --> 10:55.600
And, it's a dick thing, man. I can't stop playing, I just can't.

10:55.600 --> 10:57.840
Sorry, you gotta hear some of it over again, cause I fucked up.

10:57.840 --> 11:02.160
Sometimes me and my friends would wake up at 9 o'clock, go down to Coney Island, play all day.

11:02.160 --> 11:09.520
I used to wake up, or not wake up, I used to go, like, after midnight, go down to CCL and play until 3 in the morning.

11:09.520 --> 11:10.480
That is pretty hardcore.

11:12.080 --> 11:13.600
Okay, here comes the stealth line again.

11:13.600 --> 11:20.600
From about 2003 to 2004, I was undefeated in all New York City fair options tournaments.

11:20.600 --> 11:25.800
I take pride in saying that I'm one of the few people, if not the only person in the

11:25.800 --> 11:29.800
world that can stealth every hard 10-footer in the game backwards, meaning I could do

11:29.800 --> 11:34.300
it without looking or I could turn the arrows off.

11:34.300 --> 11:36.120
That just takes some insane memorization.

11:36.120 --> 11:40.280
I mean, you really do have to play the game a lot to know those songs, you know, like

11:40.280 --> 11:42.280
the back of your hand.

11:42.280 --> 11:46.960
active repetition. Didn't you say you played so much love on DDR second mix that you

11:46.960 --> 11:52.720
could do the same thing? Yeah. Yeah. I used to do that Dynamite Rage. It's Dynamite Rave by

11:52.720 --> 11:55.520
the way I don't know I don't know if you've ever played the song before. God it's been that long

11:55.520 --> 12:01.000
since I've played I actually forgot the title. You remember who was it Enrique who used to play

12:01.000 --> 12:09.200
with us when he and I would play um love to me backwards just repetition. I'm sorry I don't know

12:09.200 --> 12:12.920
this whole thing what's all about cuz I've been playing Tetris but I just

12:12.920 --> 12:17.400
heard him say that and everything and I'm like it takes somebody so arrogant

12:17.400 --> 12:20.920
and so full of themselves to say that I'm like the only person in the world

12:20.920 --> 12:25.940
who can do this because I'm pretty sure he's not to this guy's credit though MTV

12:25.940 --> 12:28.820
is probably coaxing this out of him you know what I mean like I I know these

12:28.820 --> 12:33.120
interview people can be sometimes and it he's probably I don't know I don't know

12:33.120 --> 12:36.120
this guy so I'm not going to assume anything.

12:39.120 --> 12:44.120
I work out. I'm not working out to get fit. I'm working out to see if I can get a better score on a song.

12:44.120 --> 12:48.120
I'm not listening to music. I'm thinking of ways that I can get better and do things better.

12:50.120 --> 12:55.120
Alright dude, so you have a huge tournament coming up. The huge championship, right?

12:55.120 --> 12:59.120
You can't train 24 hours a day in an arcade. So what do you do? How are you prepping at home?

12:59.120 --> 13:07.480
I got the pad at home. I'm playing on the pad. I also have these step charts that I'm

13:07.480 --> 13:11.560
looking at. They're step charts of the hardest songs in the game, cheat sheets if you want

13:11.560 --> 13:15.940
to call them. I'm looking at those patterns and I'm trying to figure out what I'm going

13:15.940 --> 13:19.080
to use on people, what I'm not going to use on people. I'm trying to get my confidence

13:19.080 --> 13:22.000
up because it's not only a physical thing, it's a mental thing.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.680
You think you're going to win this tournament?

13:23.680 --> 13:28.680
I'm winning. It's not even a question of whether I think I'm going to win or not. I'm winning.

13:28.680 --> 13:31.680
Let me explain to you who these people are.

13:31.680 --> 13:34.680
This is New York's finest CDPD.

13:34.680 --> 13:36.680
What I'm focused on most is tech expert.

13:36.680 --> 13:37.680
You're ready, sketch.

13:37.680 --> 13:39.680
I'm ready, let's go, let's do it.

13:39.680 --> 13:41.680
It's going to be very competitive.

13:41.680 --> 13:43.680
A lot of the best players from the country are in it.

13:43.680 --> 13:45.680
This is for $2,000.

13:45.680 --> 13:47.680
Here we go.

13:49.680 --> 13:52.680
I have the speed mile record for New York City.

13:52.680 --> 13:54.680
I was the first person to get the highest score

13:54.680 --> 13:56.680
and the hardest only course in the game,

13:56.680 --> 13:57.920
which is a marathon course.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.880
I've cleared over a thousand beats per minute.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.080
I would rank myself up there.

14:01.080 --> 14:02.360
I would rank myself the best, I mean.

14:02.360 --> 14:04.720
Me, me, me, me, I, I, I, I, I.

14:04.720 --> 14:06.480
A thousand beats a minute?

14:06.480 --> 14:07.900
Uh, what?

14:08.880 --> 14:10.480
I think he's talking about the arrow scroll speed.

14:10.480 --> 14:11.720
I know, but.

14:11.720 --> 14:12.560
Yeah, I know, I know.

14:12.560 --> 14:13.560
Whatever.

14:13.560 --> 14:16.580
Not to sound cocky, but I work hard for it.

14:16.580 --> 14:18.380
Not to sound cocky or anything,

14:18.380 --> 14:21.680
but did I mention how awesome I am?

14:25.440 --> 14:26.560
We had it taken off.

14:26.560 --> 14:29.980
hold on hold on extra for hold on

14:29.980 --> 14:33.680
let's reaffirm something here how how how much about this whole DDR in the

14:33.680 --> 14:35.040
culture everything do you know about

14:35.040 --> 14:39.840
I don't know that much actually so as an outside observer repeat what you just

14:39.840 --> 14:40.880
said off the microphone

14:40.880 --> 14:45.280
I think having the bar behind him is cheating

14:45.280 --> 14:49.160
because it's he's leather it's letting himself push on them numbers faster

14:49.160 --> 14:52.260
and there's two numbers just

14:52.260 --> 14:58.500
just arrows

14:58.500 --> 15:02.340
my adrenaline is through the roof right now um best feeling i've had in my life

15:02.340 --> 15:06.020
me and my friends are probably gonna go and celebrate and this is gonna hang in

15:06.020 --> 15:09.860
my house and that's how it's gonna be yes

15:09.860 --> 15:12.980
you're gonna hang the trophy in your house it looks like the same type of

15:12.980 --> 15:19.300
trophy they give you for little league all right um here's some comments from

15:19.300 --> 15:25.140
our chat room right now let's see uh jaded 2006 says lol i can do max 300

15:25.140 --> 15:29.860
stealth uh let's see popanda 21 i'm the only person in the world that's perfect

15:32.580 --> 15:38.340
uh let's see um sex testicle let's see uh where's the one somebody said something about

15:38.340 --> 15:41.620
oh illusion says i could clean out my vagina with this guy

15:41.620 --> 15:49.620
Zachu says, oh, Zachu says, fuck you man, try doing a ten-footer with six options, Extrofer.

15:49.620 --> 15:51.620
Ooh, burn.

15:51.620 --> 15:53.620
He just threw down.

15:53.620 --> 15:56.620
I don't fucking care.

15:56.620 --> 16:04.620
Oh wait, did I cause controversy? It's okay, just why don't you masturbate or something, it's okay.

16:04.620 --> 16:09.260
like someone else in the tournament and he came in like third or second or something like that

16:09.260 --> 16:10.860
and how this interview would end.

16:10.860 --> 16:15.540
You know I still don't think he's as cool as the guy who did DDR on crutches.

16:15.540 --> 16:22.540
Alright. The guy with one leg. Alright you asked we did we uh we uh went ahead and

16:22.980 --> 16:27.940
talked about the video on the show I don't know if that's the res-

16:27.940 --> 16:31.580
I don't know if that's- For the record I still think it's cheating.

16:31.580 --> 16:35.620
I don't know if that's the response you wanted buddy, but sorry we call him as we see him

16:35.620 --> 16:38.560
I might add his soft pad they had at home is

16:39.180 --> 16:46.740
Red octane, you know wannabe pad. They look like crap skype lines open if I want to call

16:49.340 --> 16:51.460
Let's just see who gets on there first

16:51.460 --> 16:58.380
first.

16:58.380 --> 17:02.180
I'm trying to wait for our British guy to call back because I promised we could get

17:02.180 --> 17:03.900
him on.

17:03.900 --> 17:06.700
I'm kind of secretly hoping Zach will call back too.

17:06.700 --> 17:07.700
Hey Rob.

17:07.700 --> 17:08.700
Yes.

17:08.700 --> 17:09.840
I'm so awesome.

17:09.840 --> 17:14.900
I can pass every song and I'm perfect.

17:14.900 --> 17:15.900
Shut up.

17:15.900 --> 17:16.900
We got a call back.

17:16.900 --> 17:17.900
Hi.

17:17.900 --> 17:18.900
Hi.

17:18.900 --> 17:19.900
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

17:19.900 --> 17:20.900
Simo again.

17:20.900 --> 17:26.340
on no video this time that's all right how you doing simil yeah that should sort it out now

17:26.340 --> 17:32.980
all right what's on your mind buddy um just about the ddr dancer uh-huh what about him

17:34.260 --> 17:36.740
um basically just one thing

17:41.060 --> 17:45.700
when he's actually dancing and everything why doesn't he just spend the 40 a day or whatever

17:45.700 --> 17:48.700
whatever he's doing to buy a machine for home?

17:48.700 --> 17:51.700
I don't know, that's a good question.

17:51.700 --> 17:55.700
Well, you know, it's one of those impulse buy things.

17:55.700 --> 17:58.700
It's harder, you know, we could probably say the same thing

17:58.700 --> 18:01.700
about we pay $30 a month to do this radio show

18:01.700 --> 18:04.700
and at that rate we could have bought our own server by now, you know what I mean?

18:04.700 --> 18:06.700
I can't really talk. I did.

18:06.700 --> 18:08.700
You built your own machine.

18:08.700 --> 18:12.700
The difference between going out and spending $3,000 on a machine

18:12.700 --> 18:14.700
and spending, how much did you spend on yours?

18:14.700 --> 18:18.700
$3,000. That was the exact same conclusion I came to.

18:18.700 --> 18:24.700
I was like, you know, I'm tired of playing in an arcade where all the machines are broken, so I'm gonna build my own. I did.

18:24.700 --> 18:31.700
He doesn't get the recognition that he would get if he's playing it in front of people, so I think it's an arrogance thing, actually.

18:31.700 --> 18:33.700
It's an ego thing.

18:33.700 --> 18:40.700
He wants people around him to feed his ego. I mean, that's obvious, the way he was talking himself up, that he needed ego fodder.

18:40.700 --> 18:46.740
I don't you know what I'm taking this with a grain of salt because I think I think the MTV guys might have embellished it

18:46.740 --> 18:50.540
A little bit you know I just I those words came out of his mouth that is true

18:50.540 --> 18:56.780
But I I know the power of editing and I think there could be something interesting going on here anyway

18:57.460 --> 18:59.460
What else is on your mind simil?

19:01.220 --> 19:04.380
Okay, well, thank you so much for calling back, and I'm sorry I didn't work out on the show earlier

19:05.220 --> 19:08.780
That's okay. All right. Have a good one buddy. Thanks a lot all right. Bye. Bye

19:08.780 --> 19:09.780
Bye.

19:09.780 --> 19:10.780
Bye.

19:10.780 --> 19:11.780
And get some sleep soon.

19:11.780 --> 19:12.780
All right.

19:12.780 --> 19:15.500
Oh, did I hang up on him?

19:15.500 --> 19:16.500
Uh-uh.

19:16.500 --> 19:17.500
Yeah.

19:17.500 --> 19:18.500
Oh, whoop.

19:18.500 --> 19:19.500
I hung up on somebody else.

19:19.500 --> 19:20.500
Sorry.

19:20.500 --> 19:21.500
All right.

19:21.500 --> 19:22.500
There we go.

19:22.500 --> 19:23.500
Let's go to this call.

19:23.500 --> 19:24.500
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

19:24.500 --> 19:25.500
Yeah.

19:25.500 --> 19:26.500
It's me.

19:26.500 --> 19:27.500
Yeah.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.660
I guess it was a bad idea after all.

19:29.660 --> 19:30.660
I mean, it's all right.

19:30.660 --> 19:33.740
I mean, I can understand the criticism, but that's okay.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.180
I mean, you call it as...

19:35.180 --> 19:37.340
You pretty much called it as you see it.

19:37.340 --> 19:38.340
Okay.

19:38.340 --> 19:41.980
for me is that because you have you met this guy being on the outside I've met

19:41.980 --> 19:45.520
this guy I've hung out with this guy you know on several occasions was this a

19:45.520 --> 19:49.940
fair assessment of him um he's pretty much I mean if you get to know him he

19:49.940 --> 19:53.860
doesn't sound very it doesn't sound as arrogant as you know it doesn't sound

19:53.860 --> 19:57.900
you know it doesn't sound arrogant at all you really know how awesome I am

19:57.900 --> 20:02.700
very humble we got to knew it's just you know when he gets the opportunity to for

20:02.700 --> 20:08.020
these types of things he tries to market himself but you know as I said once you

20:08.020 --> 20:12.140
get to know him he's pretty much very humble he just hates it you know he he

20:12.140 --> 20:15.540
doesn't care about what other people says because he doesn't feed into that

20:15.540 --> 20:19.260
negative negative but he knows how to strut his stuff on the catwalk right is

20:19.260 --> 20:23.700
basically because he pretty much he has to put foot to ass to his skills put it

20:23.700 --> 20:27.740
that way he didn't just magically get you know get them it was a long way up

20:27.740 --> 20:32.480
there I respect that four to five years of hard work trying to get up to that to

20:32.480 --> 20:36.660
that level okay you don't do that by showing off you earn people's respect

20:36.660 --> 20:41.700
he you know this guy doesn't win all the time I mean you know when he loses he

20:41.700 --> 20:46.940
learns from his mistakes to get better and you know honestly people like him or

20:46.940 --> 20:53.100
you know our prime example of what a TDR player should be I totally disagree

20:53.100 --> 21:01.180
with well that's the best ER player the world can be complete jackasses no no I

21:01.180 --> 21:06.300
didn't mean being an asshole or anything I just mean it just meant as

21:06.300 --> 21:10.860
you know someone who wouldn't you know blatantly show off someone's very humble

21:10.860 --> 21:18.780
I'm sure if he were truly that humble he wouldn't be such a braggart remember

21:18.780 --> 21:23.700
and usually in real life he could prove that to you but the thing is that he's

21:23.700 --> 21:27.820
making himself sound like he wins all the time and you yourself said no not he

21:27.820 --> 21:32.800
does it depends you know mostly he's one of the best one of them but he was he

21:32.800 --> 21:37.560
himself was saying he was the best believe me there are other people that

21:37.560 --> 21:42.120
are up to his level and I'm from New York I would know it did say exactly to

21:42.120 --> 21:45.360
be fair though he did say in that video that he was you know he was he was

21:45.360 --> 21:50.200
bragging about being you know the best so but I mean but I I understand you

21:50.200 --> 21:53.080
know but I'm trying to give this guy a break because I understand that kind of

21:53.080 --> 21:58.600
energy that having an MTV person in your house can kind of give you that sort of

21:58.600 --> 22:01.240
thing you know you're gonna make yourself sound like the shit I

22:01.240 --> 22:07.080
Understand that what happened to the Asian people weren't they the best at it what the Asian with the stereotype

22:12.560 --> 22:14.560
No

22:15.680 --> 22:20.960
Though I honestly would like to I would honestly like to see see that guy versus like a

22:21.760 --> 22:23.720
Tigger or a

22:23.720 --> 22:25.240
Who's that?

22:25.240 --> 22:29.480
bitsy j s b now that our j s b i mean this guy's played pickles you know what

22:29.480 --> 22:31.240
i want to talk about a pump

22:31.240 --> 22:33.960
pompous nevermind i'm not one you mentioned

22:33.960 --> 22:37.640
i'm not gonna i'm not gonna go there cuz i'm gonna get more hate mail you know if

22:37.640 --> 22:40.920
you go to digital life this year guys you probably will see him

22:40.920 --> 22:44.440
and if you you know if if willing you probably will get the chance to

22:44.440 --> 22:47.960
interview him can't can't wait can't wait

22:47.960 --> 22:51.080
i can't wait to meet him all right zack we have a good one

22:51.080 --> 22:54.760
all right later we wanted to give you a fair counterpoint here on the program

22:54.760 --> 23:11.760
Alright, I know some of you guys are trying to get in, but we're way past the three hours of our lives that we've set aside for this program, so we're going to try and get back into it, we want to do the cage match, maybe we'll open up Skype a little later, because I saw some people calling in that weren't trying to call during the live show, so I want to see if I can maybe get a couple of them.

23:11.760 --> 23:13.760
Yeah, I gotta make a song.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.760
Yeah, when are you going to make your stinking song?

23:15.760 --> 23:29.160
I was working on it and I keep, I have a really bad thing with writer's block right now and I've been trying to get past it. I've been like taking breaks from stuff and you know going back to it and it's just not working.

23:29.160 --> 23:33.200
So, my thing is now is I'm gonna make a song.

23:33.200 --> 23:36.920
I don't care how crappy it is, I'll submit it. Because

23:36.920 --> 23:43.380
I've got to do something. So I can at least listen to the other songs so I can

23:43.380 --> 23:49.520
play them on the show. Alright, we're gonna get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match now.

23:49.520 --> 23:51.060
It's a very important part of our show.

23:51.060 --> 23:54.240
After all that fighting, what more appropriate thing to do than the Orange

23:54.240 --> 23:57.360
Lounge Radio Cage Match? Let me readjust the volume levels here so I don't blow out

23:57.360 --> 23:58.300
your speakers at home.

23:58.300 --> 24:07.620
The way the Orange Lounge Radio cage match works, three songs go into the cage match,

24:07.620 --> 24:09.820
one from each co-host here on Orange Lounge Radio.

24:09.820 --> 24:13.760
You guys vote for your favorite, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long here

24:13.760 --> 24:19.380
on Orange Lounge Radio's 24-7 Bimani and Video Game Music program, and let's start off with

24:19.380 --> 24:20.940
a clip of last week's winner.

24:20.940 --> 24:25.740
It was my pick, because I'm special, okay not really, but you guys did vote for it.

24:25.740 --> 24:30.540
Deep Dish with a song named after the town where Orange Lounge Radio broadcasts from.

24:30.540 --> 24:37.540
West Coast yo, it's Deep Dish with Sacramento, song number one, it's a nice case measure.

25:00.540 --> 25:05.540
I'm just a man

25:10.540 --> 25:14.540
California's sleeping and you've got me weeping

25:14.540 --> 25:17.540
I am just a man

25:17.540 --> 25:22.540
I can't help the feeling that love is always stealing me

25:22.540 --> 25:32.540
Loosen hand, Loosen hand

25:32.540 --> 25:39.540
Loosen hand

25:39.540 --> 25:47.540
Don't understand

25:47.540 --> 25:50.540
Don't understand

25:50.540 --> 25:54.540
Hi there, it's song number one in our cage match, Eat Dish with Sacramento.

25:54.540 --> 25:57.540
Let's get into song number two, which has come to us courtesy of Loki.

25:57.540 --> 25:59.540
Loki, what did you pick for us tonight?

25:59.540 --> 26:02.540
I picked the song by quarter.

26:02.540 --> 26:07.540
He's the guy that did some stuff on diverse systems.

26:07.540 --> 26:10.540
I want to say he might even be working on stuff now.

26:10.540 --> 26:17.540
There's a lot of those diverse system artists that crossed over to DJ Maxx and Odo Jamz.

26:17.540 --> 26:22.020
So, he might be on one of the- on TJ Maxx, but I can't remember.

26:22.020 --> 26:27.020
Anyways, um, this song's called Grand Parade, and I completely picked it out at random, so...

26:28.020 --> 26:33.020
Alright, we'll see if, uh, random picks are successful for Loki. Here's song number two tonight.

26:33.020 --> 26:40.020
quarter with Grand Parade. Enjoy!

27:03.020 --> 27:05.020
Oh

27:33.020 --> 27:35.020
Oh

29:03.020 --> 29:05.020
Oh

29:33.020 --> 29:35.020
Oh

30:33.020 --> 30:35.020
Oh

31:03.020 --> 31:05.020
Oh

31:33.020 --> 31:35.020
Oh

32:03.020 --> 32:05.020
Oh

32:33.020 --> 33:01.280
Song number two, Quarter with Grand Parade, let's go around and parade and cover that

33:01.280 --> 33:06.240
song in rose petals during the parade, or cover it in poop. Dark Sakura.

33:06.240 --> 33:11.760
I give the fact that it finally ended a 10. Other than that, I give it a 3. It was very

33:11.760 --> 33:16.760
repetitive, very boring, very...is it ever over yet?

33:16.760 --> 33:25.440
Alright. Loki. I give it a 5. I actually stopped listening to it after a while. Alright. I

33:25.440 --> 33:30.360
also give that song a 5, because that song reminds me of something from 2DX 5th style.

33:30.360 --> 33:35.360
Like a very generic 2DX song, spread out across about 25 minutes.

33:36.360 --> 33:38.360
Xtavor, you wanna rate that song?

33:39.360 --> 33:42.360
Um, I don't- I don't even remember it.

33:43.360 --> 33:45.360
So I give it a zero.

33:47.360 --> 33:51.360
Alright kids, Dark Soccer has a chance to redeem, I guess, a little bit here.

33:51.360 --> 33:53.360
Wow, we all panned that one.

33:53.360 --> 33:55.360
Dark Soccer, what do you think of song 3? What's coming up?

33:55.360 --> 33:59.360
This is a group, I believe they're from the Bay Area, called Babyland.

33:59.360 --> 34:07.880
they are sort of a synth industrial pop punk. They do some of everything like

34:07.880 --> 34:12.680
their drum kit is like metal tubs and pipes. They're really

34:12.680 --> 34:17.560
amazing. The song is called Jerry, I think is how it's pronounced. Yep. And actually

34:17.560 --> 34:19.880
there's a video for this that's up on their website too, but they're just

34:19.880 --> 34:23.440
fantastic. I'm going to see them in Berkeley on the 15th next month. So it's

34:23.440 --> 34:27.640
an indie band. Indie! Oh yeah, I go indie as often as I can. Alright here it is

34:27.640 --> 34:34.640
star number three, Babyland. Jerry, enjoy.

34:57.640 --> 35:11.640
We build from experience We go on, because we know there's nothing more than wanting

35:11.640 --> 35:24.640
Conquest past the bitterness To hold on, and you know there's something worth awaiting

35:24.640 --> 35:29.640
This is the part of me I understand though

35:29.640 --> 35:34.640
I know I can't control the wonder of it all

35:34.640 --> 35:38.640
I truly have a feeling

35:38.640 --> 35:41.640
Don't tell me I'm wrong

35:41.640 --> 35:46.640
I'm living on to the part of something new

35:46.640 --> 35:51.640
Straight lines and stereotypes are the fun

35:51.640 --> 36:00.640
As nature continues to crawl, curved lines in the big city skies

36:00.640 --> 36:05.640
The bright lights in the open your eyes, in your eyes

36:05.640 --> 36:14.640
We grow from experience

36:14.640 --> 36:22.640
We go on because we know there's nothing worth inquittin'

36:22.640 --> 36:27.640
To bow down to the negatives

36:27.640 --> 36:35.640
We hold strong because we know there's something worth awaitin'

36:35.640 --> 36:39.640
This is a part of me not understandin'

36:39.640 --> 36:45.640
No, I can't control the wonderful surprise

36:45.640 --> 36:49.640
It's building, it's building

36:49.640 --> 36:52.640
Don't tell me I'm wrong

36:52.640 --> 36:57.640
I'm living hard to be part of something new

36:57.640 --> 37:04.640
The straight lines and the stereotypes are gone

37:04.640 --> 37:07.640
As nature continues to crawl

37:07.640 --> 37:15.640
Curved lines in the big city skies Bright lights and open your eyes, in your eyes

37:20.640 --> 37:32.640
We live for the experience We go on because we know there's something to this wanting

37:32.640 --> 37:38.640
I want to see your mask in your eyes

37:41.640 --> 37:45.640
There, in your eyes

37:45.640 --> 37:47.640
Let's go!

38:11.240 --> 38:13.240
I got the sleep of the plan

38:13.240 --> 38:17.740
Do what I can, set it aside, cause I know what I am

38:17.740 --> 38:23.740
And I apologize if you can't comprehend

38:23.740 --> 38:27.740
You know the easiest way, get through each day

38:27.740 --> 38:30.740
But adding on in the smallest way

38:30.740 --> 38:36.740
Can't wait to see what tomorrow will bring

38:36.740 --> 38:39.740
Your eyes

38:41.740 --> 38:43.740
Your eyes

38:44.740 --> 38:46.740
Your eyes

38:46.740 --> 39:04.980
All right, that was song number three in tonight's cage match, Babyland with Jerry.

39:04.980 --> 39:06.740
Let's go around and see what the folks thought of that.

39:06.740 --> 39:07.740
Dark Sakura!

39:07.740 --> 39:09.460
Ten, and I'm gonna see them next month.

39:09.460 --> 39:10.460
That rocks.

39:10.460 --> 39:11.460
Loki.

39:11.460 --> 39:12.460
Eh, I don't know.

39:12.460 --> 39:13.460
Seven.

39:13.460 --> 39:14.460
Okay.

39:14.460 --> 39:15.460
Extifer.

39:15.460 --> 39:22.460
I haven't been being... no, no, it was good. I liked it. It was better than the last one.

39:25.620 --> 39:26.860
Seven.

39:26.860 --> 39:32.900
Oh, I like the music. It kind of sounds like the Postal Service, but like, I don't know,

39:32.900 --> 39:37.960
like a little more hardcore, which is pretty cool. The vocalist was a little screamy for

39:37.960 --> 39:44.280
me though. I don't like the screamy guys. I don't know. Not my thing. But I like the

39:44.280 --> 39:49.820
I thought musically it was good. So I give the music a nine. I give the singing a little less

39:49.820 --> 39:52.600
So I think I'll give it a seven and a half overall

39:53.240 --> 39:57.780
All right. So let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight. Here we go

39:57.780 --> 40:01.360
Starting off with song number one deep dish with Sacramento

40:01.360 --> 40:14.360
And song number two you can vote for tonight is Quarter with Grand Parade.

40:14.360 --> 40:24.920
Imagine that for about five minutes. Song number three is Babyland with Jerry. Sorry,

40:24.920 --> 40:39.040
Loki. All right, guys, place a vote now. Send a private message to Sky in the chat

40:39.040 --> 40:44.320
room with your vote and we shall reveal the winner a little later in the program.

40:44.320 --> 40:48.560
Well, Dan, we're running really late tonight. We've been on air for three and a half hours now.

40:48.560 --> 40:49.080
Can you believe that?

40:49.080 --> 40:52.040
I know. It's like the old days when we did the podcast after.

40:52.040 --> 40:54.800
I know, but we just had a lot to say tonight. Pretty crazy, I guess.

40:54.800 --> 40:56.720
We are some chatty, chatty people.

40:56.720 --> 40:59.360
That's right. Loki, what the hell are you doing online over there? I see you doing something

40:59.360 --> 41:01.600
game related. I can't see what she's doing, but I can see what you're doing.

41:01.600 --> 41:02.120
Loki?

41:02.120 --> 41:05.920
I'm just looking up the achievements for Redracer 6.

41:05.920 --> 41:07.000
They're hard.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.520
I can't remember where they are.

41:08.520 --> 41:13.560
You know most games give you like one really easy achievement, like power on the game and

41:13.560 --> 41:18.220
kill one monster and you get like 5 points, Ridge Racer don't give you any of that.

41:18.220 --> 41:20.080
You have to like 360 and you get 5 points.

41:20.080 --> 41:24.740
I can't even, I thought I did a 360 but I guess that's just my car spinning around a

41:24.740 --> 41:25.740
lot because I hit a wall.

41:25.740 --> 41:30.040
I finally broke the barrier in Ridge Racer, I was able to beat the first race finally

41:30.040 --> 41:34.320
so I, and then like after beating the first race I was able to clear like 10 races.

41:34.320 --> 41:35.320
Like really easy.

41:35.320 --> 41:39.680
So I don't know, I finally got over my Ridge Racer handicap, I guess.

41:39.680 --> 41:45.440
What is that about Splinter Cell or Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter?

41:45.440 --> 41:48.840
It says it only has 925 achievement points.

41:48.840 --> 41:50.440
I thought it had a thousand.

41:50.440 --> 41:51.440
So there's like...

41:51.440 --> 41:53.500
No, every game has a thousand, except that one.

41:53.500 --> 41:54.500
For some reason.

41:54.500 --> 41:55.500
That has 925.

41:55.500 --> 41:56.500
I don't know why.

41:56.500 --> 41:58.200
You got robbed of 75 points somewhere.

41:58.200 --> 41:59.200
Stupid.

41:59.200 --> 42:05.400
I have 1340 out of 14625 based on what I own.

42:05.400 --> 42:07.880
And you have a perfect 1000 in full auto now, huh?

42:07.880 --> 42:10.080
Yeah, I have full autos finished.

42:10.080 --> 42:11.880
So I have 50 out of 50 for that.

42:11.880 --> 42:12.880
Good job.

42:12.880 --> 42:17.520
But like, there's games I bought, you know, now, at the time at launch, you know, I thought,

42:17.520 --> 42:22.780
oh, those are gonna be really cool games, you know, like Perfect Dark Zero.

42:22.780 --> 42:26.160
And I haven't played, I've played that twice.

42:26.160 --> 42:27.680
I couldn't get into Perfect Dark Zero.

42:27.680 --> 42:30.500
I understand where people are like totally loving this game. I couldn't do it.

42:30.500 --> 42:37.140
I liked the club. I liked the club level in that game. That really was the most fun level

42:37.140 --> 42:39.860
to me. But I can't play it because I get motion sick.

42:39.860 --> 42:44.220
Yeah, it's just, it's just, I've played mostly the arcade games. Like most of my achievements

42:44.220 --> 42:46.300
are little 200 pointer games.

42:46.300 --> 42:50.580
Well, I have a lot of the arcade games. Like, I need, here's the ones I got to play through.

42:50.580 --> 42:54.660
Because I'm playing on selling some of this stuff back. Full auto, I'm debating whether

42:54.660 --> 42:58.800
I want to sell it back because I do like the game, but I'm kind of done with it, and there really isn't

42:59.440 --> 43:04.840
In multiplayer wise it's only two player, and there's not really any good deathmatch type you know

43:05.720 --> 43:08.080
You know stuff for it, so

43:09.560 --> 43:11.640
I'm thinking probably just gonna sell that one back

43:13.520 --> 43:16.960
But the other games I want to like blaster real quick the outfit

43:16.960 --> 43:20.480
I need to go through that real quick because it's a cool game, but uh I

43:21.400 --> 43:23.560
Don't know. I just haven't really played it online

43:23.560 --> 43:30.200
online. Call of Duty 2, I'm kind of getting tired of that game, so I need to finish the

43:30.200 --> 43:37.280
whole game on, I guess, Veteran, which should be friggin' hard. And Ghost Recon, eh, I just

43:37.280 --> 43:42.120
need to play that more. It'll be, I think, a lot more fun. I don't know, Need for Speed

43:42.120 --> 43:47.360
Most Wanted, that game looked kind of lame, so I just have to go through that. Then I

43:47.360 --> 43:51.000
need to borrow your Cameo, because I started achieving points on that, and I sold mine

43:51.000 --> 43:55.000
Yeah, you can borrow that. I want to play Burnout, so we'll make a little trade or something.

43:55.000 --> 43:59.000
Maybe Amp 3 or something. Well, I'm almost... I'm on rank...

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
Wait, do you have Amp 3, like with you?

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
I had Amp 3.

44:02.000 --> 44:03.000
Oh, damn you.

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
Why?

44:04.000 --> 44:05.000
I need to play more games.

44:05.000 --> 44:08.000
I sold it back, but I'm gonna probably buy it again.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
Okay.

44:09.000 --> 44:14.000
Because it actually, for those who might not know that out there, it dropped in price to $39.99.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
Oh, that's cool.

44:15.000 --> 44:20.960
So, if you can find it, great, um, actually now I can get games through my work, so all

44:20.960 --> 44:26.940
the new release games I can get for cost plus 7.75% or tax.

44:26.940 --> 44:29.940
So let me borrow Need for Speed, I'll let you borrow Cameo.

44:29.940 --> 44:31.580
I need something I haven't played yet.

44:31.580 --> 44:36.860
Well, I can let you borrow Need for Speed, I've got like, yeah, sure, alright, it's a

44:36.860 --> 44:37.860
cool game.

44:37.860 --> 44:38.860
Something you're not playing a lot of.

44:38.860 --> 44:42.300
It's a cool game, I just, um, I just haven't really gotten into it yet.

44:42.300 --> 44:43.860
Okay, that'd be cool.

44:43.860 --> 44:47.860
Because I want to get some more achievement points too. I'm feeling like achievement point

44:47.860 --> 44:48.860
whoring it up a little bit.

44:48.860 --> 44:49.860
I swear to god that shit is crack.

44:49.860 --> 44:50.860
Is it?

44:50.860 --> 44:52.860
It gets me to buy games I wouldn't normally buy.

44:52.860 --> 44:55.860
See, that's Microsoft's got you. Buy the balls.

44:55.860 --> 45:01.860
Alright. To be honest, I do buy games just for the show to talk about them.

45:01.860 --> 45:04.860
You know what? I find that to be my weakness too. In fact, I was just commenting.

45:04.860 --> 45:07.860
We were in Fry's the other day and I was just commenting to somebody that like,

45:07.860 --> 45:11.860
Oh my god, I started buying a lot more games when we started doing this program.

45:11.860 --> 45:15.620
It's bad. Just to give me more to talk about on the program,

45:15.620 --> 45:18.500
we need to get gaming companies to send them to us for free. I think that should be our

45:18.500 --> 45:19.060
mission at E3 this year.

45:19.060 --> 45:23.060
Well no shit, I'm selling them at work. We're supposed to be getting them sent to us,

45:23.060 --> 45:23.620
but

45:23.620 --> 45:29.100
certain people in certain parts of Texas are cock blocking me when it comes to

45:29.100 --> 45:30.900
getting free products sent, so.

45:30.900 --> 45:34.340
All right.

45:34.340 --> 45:37.100
Xtavor, you had a comment you wanted to make a little bit ago.

45:37.100 --> 45:42.100
I just wanted to say I'm sorry if I offended anybody tonight.

45:42.100 --> 45:46.500
I just thought I would be a little bit gentleman-like and say that. Extend my

45:46.500 --> 45:47.420
apologies.

45:47.420 --> 45:51.860
He got a good lashing during the cage match. No, I'm teasing.

45:51.860 --> 45:57.500
I'm glad to hear it. Alright, anyway, let's do the winner of tonight's cage match, shall we?

45:57.500 --> 46:00.860
You guys wanna hear who won? Sure.

46:00.860 --> 46:04.000
I will let you know that song two did get one pity vote.

46:04.000 --> 46:07.760
so uh... you know i didn't get it was it wasn't all for nothing mochi

46:07.760 --> 46:11.480
uh... but in the end only one of the other two songs could be victorious and

46:11.480 --> 46:14.960
it was

46:14.960 --> 46:16.040
gerry

46:16.040 --> 46:19.240
indian

46:19.240 --> 46:21.980
with the screaming guy

46:21.980 --> 46:26.620
okay a lot of their other stuff is a lot more industrial sound and you know so

46:26.620 --> 46:28.560
his screaming does fit but that one

46:28.560 --> 46:32.040
i actually thought that you would like that one for the synth poppy i do i like

46:32.040 --> 46:35.040
I love the music. The guy's voice is a little wacky.

46:35.040 --> 46:37.040
They have Myspace up that's got more of their stuff on there too.

46:37.040 --> 46:38.040
I'll check it out.

46:38.040 --> 46:41.040
Speaking of Myspace, we're on Myspace.

46:41.040 --> 46:42.040
Yes we are.

46:42.040 --> 46:43.040
We love Myspace.

46:43.040 --> 46:45.040
Get this, Echo Image has a Myspace.

46:45.040 --> 46:47.040
The singer from Echo Image freaking commented on my Myspace.

46:47.040 --> 46:50.040
That made me such a screaming little girl earlier this week.

46:50.040 --> 46:52.040
I mean seriously, that is so cool.

46:52.040 --> 46:54.040
So check that, Echo Image is on Myspace.

46:54.040 --> 46:55.040
Azoic is on Myspace as well.

46:55.040 --> 46:57.040
I'm trying to think of other DDR bands I saw in there.

46:57.040 --> 46:59.040
I don't know, but Orange Launch Radio is on there too.

46:59.040 --> 47:03.040
just uh... it's what myspace.com slash orange andreo i think and uh...

47:03.040 --> 47:05.600
there's clips of our show and i'll probably put the chocobo clip up from

47:05.600 --> 47:10.040
tonight because that was pretty funny. We'll link the MySpace in our live journal community.

47:10.040 --> 47:13.480
I think we posted there before but we need more people to join. We only have fifty friends.

47:13.480 --> 47:15.160
I know there's more than that listed in the show.

47:15.160 --> 47:18.320
We're being total MySpace whores now but we will not spam.

47:18.320 --> 47:22.880
We might leave comments... I'll have to say that fifty in the first couple of weeks is not bad.

47:22.880 --> 47:23.960
It's not bad at all.

47:23.960 --> 47:27.160
We might leave comments that says thank you for being... we have to come up with some
