Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
And we're back here with Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 178 for this March the 26th of 2006.
A little exciting first half there.
Talked about Game Developers Conference.
A whole lot of news there in the first half.
So if you haven't heard it yet, if this is maybe the first episode of Orange Lounge Radio you're ever hearing, that's cool.
But remember that we distribute the podcast in two halves.
So you might want to look back in our podcast history there on iTunes or on our website.
Even on the feed itself, you can go back and retrieve the old MP3s.
Check out the first half of the show as well for a lot of news.
But that doesn't mean the news is done yet.
We've got plenty more to come, including... Now, I thought this rumor was already done with, Loki.
Microsoft entering the portable market.
I thought the origami thing came and went.
But what's happening now, Loki?
Well, there's another rumor going around.
This time it's brought to you by Dean Takahashi of the Mercury News.
And basically running a story that...
Jay Allard, leading a team with Greg Gibson, a system designer for the Xbox 360, and Brian Lee, the finance chief for the Xbox business.
And basically working on a device to combat against the PSP, which is going to do video, music, and games.
And the device is supposed to be in the early stages of development and should be hitting store shelves in 2007.
Maybe.
I don't know.
There hasn't really been anything that says that.
A lot of rumors because, you know, it makes sense.
But I don't know.
It could be a bomb that they'll drop at E3.
Never know.
Yeah.
Then again, it's awfully close to April.
Just coming off of this origami stuff within the past couple weeks, too, I take this with a huge grain of salt and a grain of pepper while you're at it.
I mean, this is kind of...
We will see.
I mean, anybody could be secretly plotting a portable gaming system.
There could be a secret fourth console being plotted right now.
Who knows?
I mean, this is all kind of conspiracy theories in a way.
The Phantom.
The return of the Phantom.
Actually, there was someone that was talking about working on a console, and I had to laugh.
Oh, boy.
All right, well, here's something that's not a rumor.
Well, it was a rumor, then it was a debunked rumor, and then it turned out to be true.
So here's the news that rumors sometimes do turn out to be true.
Dell did acquire Alienware earlier this week.
They did announce that they have acquired Alienware, and this was after Dell came out and said they were not looking into buying them.
Those liars.
I know.
Here's our liar of the week right here.
Dell Computing.
Didn't we have a liar of the week last week?
Here's our liar of the week, Dell.
What's interesting is Alienware's response to this.
They say here,
So perhaps the biggest surprise to most people will be that you're not going to see a lot of changes after this announcement.
You're not going to see Alienware logos show up on Dell products and vice versa.
Our website is not going to change, and the majority of our business practices will stay the same.
That quote coming from one of the executives.
Oh, no, that's Alien CEO Nelson Gonzalez.
So kind of interesting there.
Their perspective on it is like, okay, yeah, Dell bought us, but they're not going to change us yet.
Although usually in buyouts, change is inevitable.
But we'll see.
We'll see.
All right.
Let's go to another story.
We're going to go over to Loki, who has a story about Namco.
Yes.
Anyways, if you're... Excuse me.
I'm going to lose my voice here.
If you're interested in some fine Namco products, then you'll be surprised to know that Club Namco has launched.
It's basically like an online...
Shop for Namco related goodies including t-shirts, stuffed toys, and more whoring of the Pac-Man franchise, correct?
Yes, plenty of whoring being done by Pac-Man.
But they had some pretty cool stuff like you can get Pac-Man and the stuffed ghosts as well as Dig Dug and Galaga t-shirts.
Numerous Pac-Man t-shirts, including a Pac-Man cushion for a chair.
Anything new, like Tekken?
No.
I want a Pac-Man ghostie.
I actually do have a Pac-Man plushie.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
DarkSakura
There's several things going on, although some of this also floats the international scene, I should say.
Well, you know, a lot of times the news does.
The stuff we talk about here happens there.
Stuff that happens there goes on over here, so it's inevitable.
Well, Scott Henson of Microsoft is basically going through considerations on how to improve the Xbox 360 dashboard and multimedia.
Actually, this sort of stems from some of the results of the PS3's online interface.
They've basically left the dashboard for the 360 as something that is infinitely upgradable.
Smart.
They have been taking the suggestions of those people on Xbox Live who've been turning them in and are trying to put more features on there that the Xbox market will want.
Something I learned this week, when you set a picture as your background, I'd like to be able to set different pictures for different pages in the dashboard.
So if anybody from Microsoft is listening, that would be my suggestion.
Allow more customization in that aspect.
It doesn't cost me points, thank you.
Well, there is a comment on here just to quote.
You said the capability is there.
There are all kinds of features that have come in.
One of the top requested features is the ability to download from the marketplace in the background, so we're looking at it and prioritizing that list of requests.
You basically didn't comment on anything in particular.
They're also talking about their HD specifications, how they want to keep it high, but they're going to keep it in the level that most listeners are focusing on.
Not listeners, players.
Sorry, I'm thinking of our listeners.
I love you all.
Alright.
You know, there's also mentioned consideration of Blu-ray, but I don't know that they're necessarily going to be looking into it.
Honestly, I'm tired of hearing about all the Blu-ray rumors.
Versus HD DVD and blah blah blah.
Yeah.
Also, something that we did touch on earlier, there are going to be
Mega Drive Games on the Revolution
So we are going to be seeing Genesis Mega Drive games on the Revolution available.
They call it the Virtual Console.
We'll feature NES Super Nintendo games, TurboGrafx, and backwards compatible GameCube through the disk drive.
But Sega...
We actually have a quote from Nalia Tsurumi, who is the CEO of Sega America and Sega Europe.
Sega's support of the virtual console system will introduce more gamers to the classic Mega Drive hits and reinvigorate many of our popular brands.
That's interesting.
Now, why did they release it with two separate names?
Why did they rebrand it the Genesis here?
Do you know?
Because I didn't follow that whole saga.
This was years ago.
I don't know.
It has to be part of a marketing deal or whatever.
For example, Sega CD was the Mega CD.
It's just
How they did it, alright, whatever.
So you're up, folks, whenever we're talking about, you know, hooray, Sega Genesis games are compatible.
Just know that for you, replace Genesis with Mega Drive, and you're good.
Remember, Sega does what Nintendo does.
Oh, stop.
Moving on.
Guess what game's going to be on the DS?
Well, I already know because I looked at the outline for tonight.
Play along!
I don't know, DarkSakura.
What game will be playable on the DS?
A gun game!
Oh, right.
I like guns.
But not really.
Point Blank is going to be out on the DS.
I was hoping for Wild Gunman.
No, I won't.
Or Hogan's Alley.
Gangster Town.
Anyway.
From the Master System since we've been talking about Sega.
Point Blank was cool, too.
I really dig Point Blank.
But basically, instead of using the light gun, you're going to use the stylus.
Tap on the screen.
You have your arcade mode.
You have 40 different sequences that are going to be coming up from the arcade in the PlayStation games.
You'll shoot clay pigeons, cardboard cutouts, aliens, everything.
Little bouncing balls.
Pac-Man, not really.
All right.
There's a wireless multiplayer mode that's going to work with one card, a high score free play mode, a few others.
There's going to be a mode called Brain Massage, which analyzes and offers feedback as you play.
Brain training, anyone?
The other is called Games Museum.
Kind of on the wording there, but...
It's basically adapted older point-blank levels.
I think that's kind of an interesting concept.
I'm surprised we haven't seen this yet, or at least if it's been out, I haven't heard of it, so sorry.
Like a gun game with the stylus.
I'm kind of surprised it's taken us this long to get there.
You know what I'd like to see is the Gun Survivor series, the Biohazard Gun Survivor series with the stylus.
You know, I actually really enjoyed playing, because when we went to Las Vegas way back when on the DDR Freak Moderator's trip, I got to play Biohazard Gun Survivor 2, which was the one set in the Code Veronica universe, and that was cool.
It was always, you controlled it with the gun.
Mm-hmm.
I always thought they should have a game like that on the DS where you're controlling it and then using your D-pad to shoot too.
But no one ever listens to my suggestions in the video game industry.
I had a GunCon, which is strange because I usually don't collect a lot of the accessories, but I did have a GunCon.
I like Point Blank.
I have my GunCon too.
I actually have the upgraded GunCon because I wanted to get Vampire Knight.
I never did.
Oh well.
And besides that, it's all about House of the Dead.
So, there's a little bit more.
There was an announcement by Nintendo and British Telecom saying that there are going to be over 600 Wi-Fi hotspots for the DS and other Wi-Fi capable units.
Nintendo UK and BT Open Zone announced that they are going to have these hotspots open up to retailers across the UK and Ireland.
The hotspots are going to provide these retailers and their customers with ways to use the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection service.
There's also going to be different playable demos, movies of upcoming titles, sort of how we saw at E3.
Game, GameStation, HMV, Toys R Us, Smith's Toys, and other different retailers across the area.
Games to be initially included in downloads, Polarium, Meteos, and
You get to meet Miyamoto's Nintendog Pick.
Upcoming downloads in April and May.
They're going to be Pokemon Link, Trauma Center Under the Knife, Dr. Kalashima's Brain Training, How Old is Your Brain, other playables.
There's going to be special items for Animal Crossing and a special Metroid Prime Hunters movie.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Wi-Fi is cool and all.
There's something about having that feedback in person of somebody going, Oh, you bastard, you killed me.
Keep in mind those demos only stay on your system as long as your system is not turned off.
Well, that's true.
I remember E3, we downloaded the Meteos demo.
My buddy Brad and I downloaded the Meteos demo, went back to the hotel that night and played all night long.
It was awesome.
Well, see, I actually downloaded Electroplankton.
See, I was never able to get that game.
I was never ever able to get that game.
Like, it was always full whenever I tried to grab it.
I was playing Electroplankton in the line to get into the PlayStation 3.
Oh yeah, that's cool.
But I think that, you know, it's a really cool thing, I think, that Nintendo's doing by having all these various hot spots.
Not only is it opening more places for gamers to get the new stuff as it comes out, making it available, it's offering more interactivity among gamers, I think.
The closest thing I've seen to this, besides of course those game cafes, is I was at a coffee shop not too long ago and saw three people with a laptop playing Quake.
That's cool.
Also, not to say it's the very least, but we have the last segment in our UK news, which is release date!
Alright, what kind of cool stuff is coming out for the UK folks?
On the 30th, we have Brick Amal and Funny Cards on the Game Boy Advance.
We have Animal Crossing coming out on the 31st.
About time.
You know, I really hope that the friend code thing works internationally because I've got a bunch of people on there.
I'm going to be making room for new people.
So I'd definitely like to play with some of our UK listeners.
Also, Armored Core 9 Breaker on PS2, Battle of Europe, Condemned Criminal Origins.
Condemned is a pretty neat game.
CSI, Three Dimensions of Murder, Desperados 2, Far Cry, Instincts Evolution, and Predator Ice Age 2, the Meltdown video game, we have Odama, Outrun 2006, love Outrun Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney, grab it while you can Resident Evil, Deadly Silence, Tales of Fantasia, which actually excites me That's where all our copies of Phoenix Wright went, they went over to Europe
Also, there's a tie three, Night of the Quincon, and Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter.
All right.
Very cool.
Lots of stuff to look forward to over there in the UK.
Lots of good stuff.
All right.
Outrun.
How about the U.S.?
What's coming up in the U.S.?
Fun stuff, of course.
Of course we've got... Kingdom Hearts 2 and Beatmania.
Yes, Kingdom Hearts 2 and Beatmania.
That's on my list, yes.
We do have some other games, of course.
Far Cry Instinct's Predator, if you're having a 360.
Rumble Roses XX, which should be girl-tastic.
And there's also going to be Full Spectrum Warrior 10 Hammers on PlayStation 2 and Xbox.
GameCubeFans
Harvest Moon Magic Melody.
Yet another Harvest Moon game.
Cows and sheep and puppies.
I don't hear a lot about GameCube games anymore, which is kind of sad.
About two a month.
Too bad.
Orange Launch Radio started as a station dedicated to music and rhythm video games, so of course we like to keep tabs on what's going on in that scene, because of course a lot of our listeners that have been listening to us for the four years we've been going expect it once in a while.
We're going to talk about music news.
So, Loki, some news going on with In The Groove this week, right?
Yeah, In The Groove is having their PC beta right now.
You can actually go download it off their beta website and you can play a two-song demo.
Now, haven't I played this beta before when it was called Stepmania?
You may have.
Just curious.
Ironically enough, I did poke around the data files on there, and yep, it is Stepmania.
Okay, to set this up for folks who may not know what we're talking about here, In the Groove is a DDR-like game that came out, and it's based off a PC...
simulator for DDR that's a few years old called Stepmania.
They got together with the folks that made Stepmania and out came In The Groove.
But now you're saying when you poked around these files, you found that... Okay, basically the way it is set up here, they have, instead of having all your sim files and everything in there, they have a directory of pack files or PCK files, and there's one file that's an index file for that that basically tells the program how to unzip everything and extract it so you can play it.
And that way you can't go and mess around the files because they're encrypted and compressed.
But when you look at the index file, you notice a couple things.
First off, they actually have .sm on the files.
And the best part about this, you know how they have in StepMania when you're doing edits and stuff, and it'll have...
Your directory, your folder, you can switch between different folders and stuff to edit songs.
Well, they still left it in there in the Groove Beta.
They left in the folder stuff so you can actually see what looks exactly like the StepMania step editor.
Now, this is an early build, though, right?
They may take some of this out or what?
I guess they could, but... Or it could be a marketing tool.
Hey, make your own songs.
I just hope they're playing non-selling this because I don't see the point.
Well, DDR came out on the PC and a lot of people didn't see the point of that.
Yeah, but it's not based on a game that's been out there already or a program that's been out there already that's free.
You know actually how I think that Rockstar could sell more copies of this?
Make this PC release coming up.
If they're doing this, make it into Groove 2.
Release it for the PC before you release it on consoles.
Some people will buy them both, just to have them both.
Well, here's the cool thing about it.
You can make edits and transfer them to USB drive, so you can actually go and play your edits on the arcade.
I guess that's kind of cool, but I think you can pretty much do that anyways if you have step mania.
I think there's a way to do it, yeah.
So, I don't know.
Okay, well, remember, remember, we are, and some of our listeners, too, our listeners that are music game oriented, put yourself in these shoes, we are a minority of the gaming public at large.
A lot of the gaming public has no idea that Stepmania even exists, and when they see this on store shelves, I might be a parent buying this for my kid going, oh, I want my kid to get fit, and I don't have a console, but I have a PC.
So, that's where this game's going to sell.
I don't think it's going to really sell amongst the hardcore.
Let me put it this way.
Same thing with DDR.
I always said the exact same thing about DDR PC.
The only reason to have that... I mean, it's a crappy release compared to most of the console ones.
The only reason to have it is for... A, all the downloadable characters, like Mr. Spanky, and B, to have it on the PC when you don't have a console in your house.
Like, if you're a family that doesn't have a console in your house.
So, I mean, it's just...
It's very lazy to me, to be honest.
I don't know, it's just... Well, if you're willing to check it out, if you want to check it out, here's where you gotta go.
Just go to www.inthegroove.com slash page slash ITG underscore PC underscore Mac underscore demo underscore beta.
if that's easy enough for you guys.
And you'll fill out a nice little survey and you'll download a torrent file where you can download the actual beta, which might take a little bit of time because apparently the torrent speeds are pretty slow.
Mine went pretty quick, but I don't know.
I played it and immediately when I played the game, I tried it out to see if it's anything special.
It just reinforced the fact why I don't like In the Groove.
So, I don't know.
Go ahead, check it out.
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
But now what may be a little bit of a surprise is that if you trace the big corporate structure, Sony somewhat funds the Spider-Man franchise, so you would think it would be a PS3 exclusive, but not really.
It's not the way it's going to go.
Where there's money to be made, they will release the games.
So that's that.
Loki, you also have another release news information?
Yeah, 99 Nights.
which is another kind of Dynasty Warriors-ish game that's out in Japan right now is going to be coming to the US in the fall.
And that should be pretty cool.
Looks like a pretty decent game.
Does that mean we'll finally get the demo one of these days?
Yeah, well, actually the demo just needs to hit on live.
Right now they're just offering it as like on the CD only or DVD only.
So as soon as that hits on live, then yeah, you can actually probably play the demo here in the States.
But I don't know.
Until then, we just need more games.
Moving on, we're going to get into another story here.
DarkSakura, you have another release information.
Actually, I do.
Normally, I hold off.
I only mention the releases that are coming out in the following week.
For the UK releases, I do have one to add, though, that was brought to my attention by our long-time listener, Simmel, who's actually listening right now at 4, 5, 6 a.m.
That's hardcore.
Yeah, that is hardcore.
Guitar Hero is actually getting a UK release on 7th of April for £50.
It's getting a lot, a lot, it still gets a lot, a lot of coverage.
Well, it's expensive here too.
Yeah, I'm almost... But that comparably is more expensive than it was here.
Don't get me wrong, I think Guitar Hero is a great game, but at the same time, I'm really starting to get sick of hearing about it all the time, and how revolutionary it is when you kind of think... Keep in mind, we've had it for a while, they haven't had it yet, they're
No, I know, no, no.
The mention of this makes me think about how saturated Guitar Hero is over here right now.
And don't get me wrong, it's a great game and all, but, you know, it doesn't... It's not that revolutionary.
It's not that revolutionary to me, because we've had Guitar Freaks, we've had Frequency, we've had Amplitude.
The only thing that kind of sold this game was the fun element of it and the way they kind of tied it all together.
I'm glad that it is coming out of here because I feel a lot of people have missed out on it because I really enjoy it.
Got our second guitar now.
I know, I've seen that they sell the guitars separately, too.
They have a red one that costs like $10 more.
I bet Konami's kicking their butts right now for not releasing Guitar Freaks here a couple years ago.
Should have had more faith in music games over here, Konami Japan.
Anyway, there's another game that we're going to be seeing at E3.
What's that?
BioWare is going to have some stuff out for an Xbox 360 RPG called Mass Effect.
So they're saying, though, it's speculated either this year or next, it's going to have players who form bands of adventurers and go on and, you know, kick alien butt in the future.
You know, go around different planets, explore them.
Pillage as you roam!
Go to different solar systems, different places.
BioWare spoke to IGN during the Game Developers Conference and said that prior to the battles, which are going to be in real time, players can get together and make strategies, can swap characters when the fights go on.
You have your different types of characters, your typical ones, like your long, short range, your healer, blah, blah, blah.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I know, I know, it's great.
Well, you know, because I'm crossing my fingers and my toes that we are going to get the media thing after all, so we get to go in a little bit early.
I'm thinking, I'm pretty much going to burn that time waiting in line for Nintendo Revolution, because I know that is the first place I want to go.
Press doesn't have to wait.
No, we don't.
Shit, cool.
I didn't know.
Well, I'm hoping.
I'm crossing my fingers and my toes we get to see it because I really want to share with you guys all about that.
And of course, we will be broadcasting from E3.
Still working out some details, but you can look forward to daily podcasts just like we did last year.
I want to be able to broadcast.
I told you so.
That's what I'm hoping.
Well, the listeners might be the ones broadcasting back to you, buddy.
You better be careful.
Alright, anyway, moving on to another story.
You were talking in the first half, Loki, about you've been playing Elder Scrolls for Oblivion.
Now, the game's already broken.
You were talking about a bug earlier where you couldn't jump in a certain point of the game.
You stuck because you were floating on a rock or something.
But what else is broken in Oblivion?
Well, sometimes the load times tend to be extremely long, and this is because the hard drive, it caches the game to the hard drive so that it
Loads faster and plays faster, but sometimes it gets fragmented.
However, at least they figured out that that's possible and what they did is built in a fix for it.
So if you do have that happen where your load times are excruciatingly long, what you need to do is actually hold down the A button when you reset the game and let it boot up to the title screen and that's it.
So, pretty simple, but...
Dark Sakura Dark Sakura Dark Sakura
The review of the week goes to Tequila Oh Tequila, how you make me suffer You make my stomach hurt worse than anything in the universe ever does Anything less than Patron is not worth drinking Oh how I hate thee Dear Tequila, die Not love, DarkSakura Alright, I'm laughing because I was there that night You were there
Also an F you to cheap sour mix, but mostly to cheap tequila.
You know what, Jason was telling me that he's regretting not taking pictures of you passed out because it would have been pretty funny now.
What?
I, okay, you know.
He didn't get any, but he told me he regrets not taking any.
What?
Okay, I, alright.
Admit it, it would be funny in context.
To explain, I have insanely good alcohol tolerance.
However, I have zero tolerance when it comes to cheap tequila.
On top of it, I think I'm somewhat allergic to it because I woke up with a rash on my neck, which I only get a rash on my neck if I've had something, if I've consumed something I'm allergic to.
So I think I'm allergic to tequila.
You know, we haven't done a drunk show in a while.
No.
Get off your high horse, asshole.
What?
I have a designated driver to pick me up every time.
Always.
Always.
We do it safe.
So, I don't know.
I just had to get that.
That's another FU.
FU to a...
I actually am here, but as far as my, I've been, you've seen me drink on the show, and the one time I got sick on the show from drinking was with that cheap tequila that was sitting on top of your refrigerator at the old apartment.
That stuff was nasty.
What was cheap?
I was drinking that tequila, and I finished, what, a fourth of the bottle?
And then I got really sick and ate waffles.
Oh, thank you, Chatroom.
Chatroom makes an excellent point here.
GK128 says Dignation was taped at the bar two weeks ago.
And I know that This Week in Tech has done shows at pubs and stuff.
So that guy can go take a flying leap.
What channel was it?
I was watching a show where it was like some science experiment show where they had people going out and taking them to the pub to get smashed off their butt and then go the next day and find out what was the best hangover cure.
We always set limits.
Be safe about it.
Because it's expensive.
I think now we have to set a date to do another one.
Just defy these negative reviews.
Let's fight our next three-day weekend.
And reaffirm our independence from these corporate non-drinking entities.
You know what?
The only way for me to actually be significantly drunk on the show is if I put down the $16 and get a couple bottles of Chimay.
Well, then we'll just all have to chip in and make it happen.
Well, I'm going to.
That is the, uh, for the record, that is the only beer that will have me drunk in one pint.
Alright, we gotta keep moving, we gotta keep moving.
Let's get to the game segments.
Uh, Loki, you're FU real quick.
Um, just a stupid driver, because I've seen too many people today, like, going in the wrong direction on the road.
Was it like, you know, when we're at lunch?
Are you sure you just weren't playing a lot of Mario?
No, when we're going, when we're at lunch, you know, the women trying to back up.
Oh, yeah, the, the chick that was trying to back up.
Yeah, yeah, that was, that was kind of crazy.
And just, you know, I don't know.
my F you would have to be having to be sober while everyone else I was with literally everyone I was with Friday night was drunk but I had to be sober because it's very responsible to have a sober driver but next time it will not be me mark my words it will not be me next time somebody else gets to play alright that's it moving on next segment
Our next story, we're going to go over to me.
And we're going to talk about the Video Game Voter Network.
We mentioned this on a previous podcast last week.
We were talking about the Video Game Voters Network.
It just launched.
Well, get this.
20,000 messages were sent to U.S.
Senators in just a week of this network being up.
So you guys really took action on this really quickly.
And, of course, something we may not have mentioned last week because it wasn't exactly clear to us at that time...
But the ESA does have a hand in this.
This is, I believe, the ESA, kind of their response to all this stuff going on is to really mobilize the gaming community.
But I stand by what I said last week.
It's a smart idea, and if you're sick of all this stuff, you've got to do something about it, right?
Just like the kid we were talking about in the first half that was getting sued.
If you want to make change, you've got to do something about it.
Also, what I thought was interesting is that on the site now, they actually have a letter from Will Wright.
Will Wright, of course, made...
Many, many classic games.
He's working on that Spore thing now.
Which is freaking awesome.
This hugely comprehensive game.
This is going to be insane.
Will Wright actually posted a letter to the site there urging people to join.
So if you don't want to join Video Game Voters Network because we told you to, then consider Will Wright's opinion for a minute.
Because that man's made a lot of great stuff.
Alright, let's go over now to...
Loki, who has a story speaking of legal things.
You've got to file patents when you're going to do new stuff, and sometimes it tells us what's coming up.
Right, Loki?
Yeah, well, the story that actually came out this week about the PSP keyboard, it's actually kind of... There was a patent for a keyboard that was going to be used via the USB port on the PSP, which is kind of retarded when you think about it, because that would mean that the keyboard is above the monitor when you're typing, so...
That would be completely awkward.
But that was one of the things that came out.
And they had kind of like a cell phone little doohickey on there.
So I don't know if that's something that they're still working on.
But this was actually, I think, shown at E3 a couple years ago, I want to say, when they originally showed the PSP.
I want to say that this was one of the things that they showed.
Or maybe it was at one of the shows.
And they had actual pictures of it that I've seen.
But I don't think it's anything.
They're probably going to change it some.
But that was interesting.
However, there was another patent, though, that was filed that I thought was pretty interesting.
And that would be by Take-Two for Vice City Stories, the next PSP Grand Theft Auto game.
Hoo-yah.
We think, right?
I mean, it's speculation, but they have filed a patent on this name.
Well, trademark.
Sorry, trademark on the name.
You can't patent a name.
Sorry, even I should know that.
All right, interesting.
Moving on, I got a story here on Windows Vista.
Of course, this is going to be the next, you know, like XP, the next version of Windows.
Get this, if you want to be playing games on Windows Vista, they're saying that you're going to have to have two gigs of RAM in order to play games on Windows Vista.
They're saying that 900 meg seems to be the bare minimum to even use like Word or PowerPoint.
If you want to play Halo 2 or any of that stuff, you're going to have to have 2 gigs of RAM to play on Windows Vista.
I suppose a little bit of this is rumor right now, but we'll see for sure when the system comes out.
All I can say is that I guess I'm glad I did upgrade this system to 2 gigs of RAM, so that if I decide to get Windows Vista, I'll be okay and good to go.
Loki had another quick story on the Vista, though.
Yeah, there was a rumor that it was being reprogrammed, or the code was being reprogrammed by the Xbox team, and that rumor was, of course, debunked.
Or at least, Microsoft is saying no, that's not the case.
So, take it as a rumor.
I don't know.
Okay.
You know what's interesting?
That program that I downloaded onto the computer to allow my Xbox to get the pictures and stuff from the network for my 360, the program actually looks like the Xbox 360 when you launch it.
It makes your desktop look like the Xbox 360.
It's kind of cute that they have that consistency going on.
Interesting.
I'm really looking forward to getting my Mac now, even more.
You know, they do have a program for the Mac that'll let you connect with your 360.
I think it's called Connect360, I think is the name of it.
I don't think it does everything, but it'll do the songs and stuff.
I think it costs money, though.
I don't know if it's totally free.
The one thing, though, I'm going to be happy about my Mac is running virtual PC so I can still play Ragnarok.
Mm-hmm.
because Ragnarok will run just fine on virtual PC.
And then run everything else that I need to.
I can play World of Warcraft.
I can actually even do podcasting.
You're going to have to get hooked up with GarageBand, the new one.
It's very intricate when it comes to podcasting.
I've tried to look at what we can do for this show with it.
I'm also going to start using whatever their broadcaster is for Pump of Volume, which will be this week.
Xtifer Xtifer
Xtifer, did you go to a big deal concert this week?
Yes, I did.
First off, welcome to the show.
Thank you.
And you guys are speaking of me?
Yes, your ears must have been burning.
Did you start sneezing a lot?
No.
When's your show coming back, your spin-off show?
Um, I'm thinking maybe in a couple weeks.
And if you think we're politically incorrect on this show, oh my gosh, listen to X for a show some night, because he doesn't even really talk about games.
Do you ever talk about games on your show?
I can talk about video games.
Alright, well you need to talk about video games tonight.
What happened?
You got to do something video game related that myself, Loki, DarkSakura, none of us got to do.
What did you do?
I went to Video Games Live, which was a concert in San Jose that they put on.
And basically it's a bunch of video game
Music that is live with an orchestra.
There was a choir there.
And also, I guess that one guy from that one show was hosting it.
Tommy Tallarico, yeah.
I don't know all of their names, but I can say that all of the music that they played was very beautiful.
They played pieces from World of Warcraft.
There was...
EverQuest 2, there was Kingdom Hearts, there was Zelda, there was Mario, there was Castlevania, apparently there was Metal Gear Solid, which I didn't see because we came in a little bit late.
Shame on you.
So you missed the Pong.
I wanted to know about the Pong.
They did Frogger, which wasn't that good.
I heard on Bobby Blackwolf's show when he had Tommy Tallarico on that he was saying something about this whole Frogger setup, that they have people play live?
What do they do?
Yeah, um...
They were playing the game live, and the conductor was conducting the music as they were playing the game.
So it was like you were hearing the live music.
It was a very expensive way to play a game, I guess.
They joked about it.
Well, didn't they give somebody a laptop for winning?
They gave somebody a very nice laptop for winning at Frogger.
He wasn't even that good, but he got a very nice laptop.
I don't know what it was called, but it was a very nice laptop.
Was it Alienware?
Is that it?
I don't know.
Okay.
But it was very nice.
I have memories of Frogger.
That's just weird.
It's a cool game.
I have memories of being in middle school at the roller rink playing Frogger on roller skates.
Did any of it make you cry?
You know, it didn't.
I was there with my boyfriend.
He was crying a little bit at some things.
But no, they were... It was very nice.
And we sat like three seats, three aisles from the front.
So we had very good seats and...
The Conductor was funny.
That Tommy guy wasn't.
Basically, as somebody that doesn't play a lot of video games, I really do like the music.
I see it as the same as music from motion pictures because it's just the same thing.
It just scores like they are scoring a movie.
I've always liked soundtrack music.
I was kind of in my own
I was very well... I thought it was a very well done thing that they did.
Alright, well thanks for that little mini review of Video Games Live.
Now this is touring, so would you recommend our listeners go see it?
I think it's touring.
It was touring and it wasn't touring.
I'm pretty sure they'll do more shows of this though.
Yeah, I think it's really cool.
I think a lot of people would be interested.
If you like Halo, they did a huge thing from Halo at the end.
It was the finale.
and they had the actual guy who composed the music that was there.
And they also had the guy, they had a lot of video game composers in the audience.
Well, you know that you were at the show during a really big week in video gaming in Santa Fe, right?
Right, right.
Okay.
Well, apparently they had the big gaming thing in the same place as we went.
Oh, okay.
But they also had the composer to World of Warcraft there.
He was there.
So that was kind of cool.
Oh, cool.
Yeah.
because when you do play games, that's all you ever play I was in my element favorite song that they played all night?
I think I would say Advent Rising I've never played the game, I've heard that it's not that good but I thought that the music was gorgeous it's a great game, it just has really horrible frame rate issues so, yeah
All right.
Maybe we'll have to check that out.
Yeah, it was gorgeous.
And Kingdom Hearts was very well done, too.
Did they do Simple and Clean from Kingdom Hearts?
Well, it was the theme to the first game.
Oh, that's hot.
So, yeah, it did have that Simple and Clean theme.
Cool.
All right.
Thank you, Xfer.
Appreciate it.
No problemo.
All right.
We're going to go over to DarkSakura every week.
She climbs the Internet up and down and searches to find a great website to share with you guys as her website of the week.
So, DarkSakura, where should the kids be pointing their Firefox browsers to this time?
Because if they're using Internet Explorer, they really should switch, right?
Amen to that.
All right.
Where should the kids go?
Tonight's website of the week is leettech.org.
1-3-3-7-T-E-C-H dot org.
I love the name.
Just the name alone really makes me giggle.
But basically, it's a tech site, but it's not like the tech sites that are about big, massive amounts of jargon.
To go ahead and quote their About Us page, I'll just read a little bit of this.
It's a website for technology and you're currently surfing it.
Thank you very much.
This site is very much different from the other technology sites for the very reason that we bring technology close to the end user.
Many an end user do not want to be bugged by big, high, and mighty terms and would like to understand how a certain technology works and so on and so forth.
But what we do is different.
We put technology in terms that people understand.
We put it into fun, casual manners so expect lots of weird examples and analogies involving toilet bowls and kitchen sinks.
That's where we're different.
We do not emphasize the news.
Websites like Splashdot do that.
We do not emphasize on reviews.
Websites like Tom's Hardware does that.
We emphasize on knowledge.
Knowledge for the common end user.
So, I thought that was pretty cool.
I kind of want to check that out.
That's almost like my teaching style, too.
When I teach things, I make all these crazy analogies to real life scenarios.
This is my day job.
I'm a teacher for a business, so kind of interesting.
What impresses me is that they have an explanation on what leet and noob are.
And to quote this, every article in the site will have a noob-o-meter, and it states how rudimentary the article is about.
For example, if the noob-o-meter is at an extreme noob end, then the articles are just perfect for beginners.
On the other hand, if the noob-o-meter is at extreme leet end, the article is for more leet users.
Warning, extreme noobness ahead.
Warning, warning.
Remember, because being a noob ain't fun.
All right.
This site instantly gets my uber kudos.
Website of the week, LeakTech1337.
Thank you, DarkSakura.
Let's go over to Loki, who has some news regarding piracy.
Yeah, of course.
Basically, I don't know.
This whole thing with the 360 and the firmware for the DVD and stuff, just
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and basically spotted his software for sale legally at a market in Moscow and has basically gotten into a fight with him and now is going to take him to an actual boxing match.
Wait, so the developer is actually going to... This is like celebrity boxing on Fox, in a way, is kind of what it reminds me of.
In the main event...
Fight Night Round 4
Out there, some of you have them in your very own PCs.
Well, they announced this last week that they have a new design contract with Sony.
They're going to get more money than what they earned for creating the graphics processor for the upcoming PlayStation 3 video game console.
This deal is going to run through 2007.
But the thing is that we don't really know what this chip is for.
Could it be possibly about the PSP2?
Who knows?
They might be bragging about the deal, but they can't talk about the details just yet.
So it could be just about anything.
So NVIDIA has a deal with Sony to make something, but we don't know what.
So I would likely say it's the PSP 2.
All right.
Thanks for watching!
Call Echo 123 first to test your connection to make sure it works.
You can also pick up the regular telephone and call us, 916-226-9067.
But please keep in mind that that may be a toll call, so please have the phone line owner's permission before you call in.
Also, we're going to be moving the Skype line on a bit more permanent basis towards the end of the show in response to recent feedback that our Skype line sometimes gets a little too random.
So what we want this to be is more the end of the show kind of open forum.
So for our callers to be able to discuss basically whatever is on their mind.
There will be a more topical version of interaction that we'll announce in a later week.
So here we go.
We're going to go ahead and pick up the phone, take our first call.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Hi, this is Simmel.
Hi, Simmel.
What's on your mind, buddy?
Just a quick call just about you actually badmouthing the UK.
Were we badmouthing?
Wait a minute, we're getting video of you here in the studio too.
That is crazy.
Look at this, we can actually see this guy who's calling in right now.
I've never seen that happen on Skype before.
That's pretty cool.
That's kind of cool.
Oh, right on.
I'm looking a bit tired because it's like half five now.
It's got to be like five or six over there.
Alright, what did we do to bash on the UK?
I'm sorry bud, what did we do?
Just about when Guitar Hero was...
Yeah, Guitar Hero?
I think the video may be slowing our connection there a little bit.
You had a question there in response to Guitar Hero.
Were we bashing on it a little bit there, or what?
Yeah, just the fact that, yeah, I'm just trying to get rid of it.
I gotta let that one go.
I'm so sorry, Simul, but we just got really, really bad feedback there, and I think people's speakers exploded during that, so sorry about that.
You guys should not bash on the UK.
We don't!
Shame on you!
We weren't!
I made a whole segment just to read UK news, thank you.
It's probably my fault because I was saying that Guitar Heroes was a little bit... I'm a little sick of it here.
But I understand you guys are getting it for the first time over there in the UK.
Yes, you should check this game out.
It's just that I am getting sick of hearing it in the US.
It's time for us to move on.
Guess what?
What?
Guitar Hero.
Tell Rob about your newest piece of crack.
Oh yes, Advanced Crack.
Yeah, I got Advanced Crack DS at, uh, it's, uh, Crack, basically, yes.
Advanced Crack DS?
Advanced Crack?
No, is that Advanced Wars?
Yes.
Ah, what is so cool about this game?
Um, it's fun as hell.
I guess hell is fun, yeah.
And Crack is Advanced.
And Crack is fun.
Yeah.
For some.
It's not regular Crack, it's Advanced Crack.
What other DS games are you into, Roz?
Phoenix Wright.
You all know about my horrible Phoenix Wright addiction.
That's right.
I remember hearing about that a couple weeks ago on the show.
How is Phoenix Wright going?
Have you beat it yet?
Like four times.
Dang!
Wow, very cool.
Weren't you the one that had to drive a long ways to get it?
Yeah, like six hours or so.
That is hardcore.
So I guess you have to beat a game four times after that type of dedication.
Any other feedback to stories we've been talking about tonight, Roz?
Uh, tonight, I came in late.
Um, but, let's see here.
Yeah, I was desperately trying to get my mic to work last week, uh, to talk about the, uh, whole girl gamers issue.
Speak up!
Um, well, obviously, uh, not being a dude kind of pisses me off how, you know, the negative stereotypes and stuff.
And, I don't know, I just don't know what everyone's collective deal is.
I mean, you know, it's always a big deal when people find out that I'm not a dude.
I don't want to rehash the old conversation.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
Sure, there's fat and ugly people that play games, and sure, there's beautiful people that play games, but you know what?
Those are the two extremes, and this is what we call a bell curve, and most people are somewhere in between.
You know, most of us are just, we're average looking.
Yeah, pretty much.
You know, I think that SSJ100, Matt actually just said it kind of best in the chat room.
You know, most people are like, oh my god, you're a girl, ASL picks please.
I get that crap on, not on the current Ragnarok that I'm playing on because people are like, oh, you're cool, you're not a bot.
But on IRO, I got it all the time.
Wow.
Yeah, I moderate at a role-playing forum and all of my characters are male, pretty much.
And so when people find out that I'm not a guy, it tends to freak them out.
And then I get all these people pouring in on Messenger trying to hit on me.
and that's invisible all the time.
Don't you get people that assume you must be a lesbian because you play a male character?
Because I've heard girls tell me that.
I've heard that.
Yeah, it's so stupid.
So stupid.
Then again, how many female characters online are really, you know, boys?
Exactly.
And we just had the emails from the guys that play the girl characters because they are good characters in the games.
It's nothing to do with... It's so silly.
Yeah, it is.
People need to put stereotypes aside.
That's what they need to do.
All right, Roz, thank you so much for your call.
Appreciate it.
Yep.
All right, have a good one.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
All right, we're going to go ahead and go to another call here.
Let's go to this one.
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
I have sweaty balls.
Thank you, my friend.
That's nice.
What, you've been playing DDR naked again, or what's the deal?
My nipples are hard.
Shut up.
Here's our mature rating for the night!
I overrated Guitar Hero?
Well, everybody does, but, yeah.
How can one overrate one's own personal opinion of the game?
Because it doesn't match up with my personal opinion, and my personal opinion is God.
I'm gonna hit you with a trap in a second.
Okay, so what, you don't like Guitar Hero?
No, I like it, it's just overrated.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
is not a hugely original concept.
It's a fusion of two existing concepts in my mind.
And that doesn't make it a bad game.
I love Guitar Hero.
It's a great game.
But I'm a little, you know, I'm kind of over it now.
You know what I mean?
It's time for me to move on to another music game for now.
Yeah, I think the reason they got like so high scores though is because they got all that
I totally agree and I think Konami made some mistakes in not having more faith in the US audience and spending the money on some higher licenses when they came out here and I take my hats off to Red Octane for recognizing that and Harmonix as well we give Konami a lot of love on this show but we have to give them tough love too when the time is appropriate so
Everybody deserves tough love, I guess.
I know.
Alright, anything else on your mind, Xander?
Oh, on the girl gamer thingy.
Okay.
I just wanted to say, I'm upset as a male asexual that I don't get bashed.
Seriously.
The gays get bashed, the girls get bashed and crap.
Why don't I get bashed?
That's not fair.
We do secretly bash you.
I bash you every night in the chat room.
They're all talking about you behind your back.
No, no, okay.
Wait, define this for me again, because this is a term that a lot of our podcast listeners are probably going, huh?
You define yourself as asexual, which means... Yes.
It means I'm an amoeba.
Are you a eunuch?
No, it means that he doesn't think about sex, period.
Okay, because if you're a eunuch, I was just going to say, you wouldn't have balls.
Okay, just shush.
Just quiet over there.
Okay, extrovert?
All right.
Okay, so, well, do you ever get asked in games, like ASL and all this?
Do you ever have people try to cyber flirt with you or whatever?
In that sense, Coke Music.
Coke Music?
What happened in Coke Music?
Um, I realized it sucked.
Why?
What happened?
Were people hitting on you there?
No, it just sucks.
It always sucked.
I just grew up a little.
Okay, okay.
Alright, well, can anybody think of a good insult for the asexual gamer?
I think I already did.
You're a nookiless freak.
How's that?
Does that count?
Does that make you feel better to be bashed there, Xander, a little bit?
I guess.
Okay, well, we appreciate your call.
I don't bash on anybody.
Have a good night and have fun not getting late, okay?
Okay.
All right, later.
Let's go to one more call.
Alright, we better set aside 10 minutes.
Zaku's on the line.
Zaku, what's on your mind?
Yes.
Remember that link I sent you last week about how MTV interviewed this DDR player from around my area?
I just want to know whether or not you got a chance to even look at it.
I'm going to be honest, I didn't.
Alright.
Send me the link and post it in chat.
I will.
I'll post it again, but honestly, you know...
If you take a look at it, you know, and personally I think, you know, MTV did a good job in doing it.
I wouldn't say they did the best, but it's not like, you know, they didn't do a lame-ass attempt in trying to, you know, trying to feed on the stereotype of DDR being a healthy thing.
Okay, set this up for me a little bit, Zaku.
What is in this clip?
If I watch this clip, what am I going to get?
You're going to see, you know, a DDR player by the name of Anthony, also known as Sketch.
He's one of the best DDR players in the city and he was interviewed by MTV for Overdrive.
Basically, you're going to see a lot of the perspective of the hardcore DDR player.
The one who basically goes after scores and just goes after perfecting...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I say get the British guy back on the line.
I know, he didn't call back.
You didn't give him enough time.
His thing blew up on me.
But British people, their voices are cool.
We need more coolness.
We've got to go ahead and close the Skype line for now.
If he calls in next week, we'll definitely get him again.
And he can yell at me more over Guitar Girl.
I think it's cool that he stays up until 5, 6 in the morning listening to us.
I know, that's dedication.
Well, you know that over on All Games where they syndicate us, they play us at like different times of the day on Tuesday and Wednesday.
So like, no, I think on Tuesday we're played like in the morning.
So that might be a different time.
So those that want the live experience to kind of listen to this as it goes on can listen at those times too.
And that can help adjust for time zones.
So something to think about.
Okay.
All right.
Beat Takashi!
Beat Takashi!
TAKASHI'S CHALLENGE
Takashi's Challenge puts the players through hell, like forcing the player to sing karaoke continuously, stare at a blank monitor, pilot a plane that can't go up, and then hit the final boss 20,000 times.
Was this a for-real video game that was released, or is this some weirdo?
Apparently, Taito released it back in 1986.
Okay.
Dot, dot, dot.
Taito is the same cracked-out company that gave us...
and Bubble Bobble.
Yeah, what's up, liar?
It got pushed back.
Loki, liar of the week.
No, EA's the liar of the week.
EA's pushed it back.
It's supposed to come out on the 28th.
Or 29th, I'm sorry.
Between the 28th and 29th, they say.
Sometime Tuesday and Wednesday.
Maybe about 8 o'clock Tuesday night is in between there.
Hey, listen, you got Burnout and freaking Blazing Angels, so play those while you're waiting.
Yes, sir.
Well, I have something.
Okay.
This is from Old Grandma Hardcore.
Oh, yes, her, the granny gamer.
The granny gamer.
Love her.
Basically, there is a chronicle out on YouTube now, and the link is up at oldgrannyhardcore.blogspot.com, about how she has laid down some massive, massive ownage at brain training.
Right on.
And apparently...
There was actually a few of the other people who were playing who actually said that drinking helped their scores improve.
But Granny had finished her game while the little girl was still going past the time limit.
Wow.
So yeah, and there's a movie file up here.
So I'm going to share that with our chat room.
But if you go to oghc.blogspot.com, the link is up there for the week of March 20th.
Very cool.
Alright, I got one last story for you guys here tonight.
And it has to do with, I'm sure, a TV show that our folks that listen to us live don't watch because it's on the same time as our program.
But it does have to do with gaming, believe it or not.
Walt Disney's Buena Vista Games said this week that it is going to be releasing a PC video game based on the television show Desperate Housewives this fall.
What? !
Desperate Housewives
Here's your chance Something tells me those guys that emailed us saying they like to play as the girls Something tells me they'll take a pass on this one Call it a hunch Loki, don't you watch Desperate Housewives?
No, I don't Oh, I thought you did
No, Nelly watches Desperate Housewives.
I do not watch Desperate Housewives.
I may have been forced to watch the first season of Desperate Housewives, but that's where it stops.
We can't.
Our show's on at the same time here on the West Coast, so we can't watch it, even if we wanted to, which I don't.
You can watch it.
You can watch it.
We have not TiVo.
You know what?
I don't feel like taking the effort.
That's just how it stands.
The only way I'd play this game is if I can kill them.
And by kill them, I mean brutally kill them.
23rd Magus says no hot coffee equals instaloos.
So maybe we need to have hot coffee in this.
So, you know, those of you guys out there that have always wanted to... What's her name?
Gabriela... What the hell's her name?
Gabriela Carteris?
No, no.
That was the chick in 90210.
I know!
Same show.
What the hell's... Oh, Eva Longoria.
She plays somebody, I think.
She plays Gabrielle on the show.
How the hell do I know that?
Okay, Eva Longoria.
Right?
She's the hot one on the show.
You know, I'm sure a lot of guys want to, you know... I guess.
I don't know.
You know what?
Forget it.
Let's just end the show.
Let's quit while we're ahead.
And we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.
Loki, your final thought.
My final thought is I just read another story that's yet pointing to Nintendo doing VR.
But,
This is rumor stories.
I hate rumor stories.
Six weeks, Loki.
You can wait.
No, I can't.
Ekstafer, your final thought.
To all the girl-babe gamers out there, preach on, brothers.
I mean, sistas.
DarkSakura, your final thought.
I'm going to pass on the reject false icons this week in order to describe a beverage called the Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster.
Those of us who read Hitchhiker's Guide know what this is.
It says the effect of a pan-galactic gargle blaster is like having your brain smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped around a large gold brick.
I need one of those right now.
My final thought would be I really suck at Geometry Wars and I'm never going to get better and that makes me a sad gamer.
