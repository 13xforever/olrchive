19821	25182	And we're back here with Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 178 for this March the 26th of 2006.
25662	27963	A little exciting first half there.
28023	29443	Talked about Game Developers Conference.
29803	31463	A whole lot of news there in the first half.
31483	37024	So if you haven't heard it yet, if this is maybe the first episode of Orange Lounge Radio you're ever hearing, that's cool.
37084	39805	But remember that we distribute the podcast in two halves.
40165	44786	So you might want to look back in our podcast history there on iTunes or on our website.
45154	48995	Even on the feed itself, you can go back and retrieve the old MP3s.
49095	51296	Check out the first half of the show as well for a lot of news.
51636	53437	But that doesn't mean the news is done yet.
53497	57879	We've got plenty more to come, including... Now, I thought this rumor was already done with, Loki.
57919	59639	Microsoft entering the portable market.
59679	62180	I thought the origami thing came and went.
62200	63541	But what's happening now, Loki?
63741	65362	Well, there's another rumor going around.
65402	70163	This time it's brought to you by Dean Takahashi of the Mercury News.
70884	73525	And basically running a story that...
74878	83305	Jay Allard, leading a team with Greg Gibson, a system designer for the Xbox 360, and Brian Lee, the finance chief for the Xbox business.
84626	92532	And basically working on a device to combat against the PSP, which is going to do video, music, and games.
93173	99058	And the device is supposed to be in the early stages of development and should be hitting store shelves in 2007.
103197	103577	Maybe.
104378	104818	I don't know.
104858	106499	There hasn't really been anything that says that.
106639	108700	A lot of rumors because, you know, it makes sense.
109300	111221	But I don't know.
111261	113662	It could be a bomb that they'll drop at E3.
114443	114763	Never know.
116424	117064	Yeah.
117384	118805	Then again, it's awfully close to April.
118945	126489	Just coming off of this origami stuff within the past couple weeks, too, I take this with a huge grain of salt and a grain of pepper while you're at it.
126529	127349	I mean, this is kind of...
128340	129541	We will see.
129741	136467	I mean, anybody could be secretly plotting a portable gaming system.
137288	140491	There could be a secret fourth console being plotted right now.
140551	140991	Who knows?
141051	143113	I mean, this is all kind of conspiracy theories in a way.
143313	144835	The Phantom.
145095	146796	The return of the Phantom.
147077	151861	Actually, there was someone that was talking about working on a console, and I had to laugh.
152661	153062	Oh, boy.
153780	155341	All right, well, here's something that's not a rumor.
155401	160123	Well, it was a rumor, then it was a debunked rumor, and then it turned out to be true.
160184	163285	So here's the news that rumors sometimes do turn out to be true.
163886	166887	Dell did acquire Alienware earlier this week.
166927	173451	They did announce that they have acquired Alienware, and this was after Dell came out and said they were not looking into buying them.
173471	177213	Those liars.
177433	177793	I know.
177913	179374	Here's our liar of the week right here.
179454	180074	Dell Computing.
180134	181215	Didn't we have a liar of the week last week?
181235	182416	Here's our liar of the week, Dell.
183655	188099	What's interesting is Alienware's response to this.
189700	190380	They say here,
207774	213817	So perhaps the biggest surprise to most people will be that you're not going to see a lot of changes after this announcement.
214057	217819	You're not going to see Alienware logos show up on Dell products and vice versa.
218179	222782	Our website is not going to change, and the majority of our business practices will stay the same.
223602	226203	That quote coming from one of the executives.
226323	229425	Oh, no, that's Alien CEO Nelson Gonzalez.
229685	230986	So kind of interesting there.
232567	237249	Their perspective on it is like, okay, yeah, Dell bought us, but they're not going to change us yet.
237970	240312	Although usually in buyouts, change is inevitable.
240352	240952	But we'll see.
241113	241453	We'll see.
242874	243214	All right.
243254	244175	Let's go to another story.
244195	247317	We're going to go over to Loki, who has a story about Namco.
248378	249859	Yes.
250380	254123	Anyways, if you're... Excuse me.
254543	255604	I'm going to lose my voice here.
257065	264851	If you're interested in some fine Namco products, then you'll be surprised to know that Club Namco has launched.
265312	266713	It's basically like an online...
267818	276300	Shop for Namco related goodies including t-shirts, stuffed toys, and more whoring of the Pac-Man franchise, correct?
276800	281542	Yes, plenty of whoring being done by Pac-Man.
282402	291524	But they had some pretty cool stuff like you can get Pac-Man and the stuffed ghosts as well as Dig Dug and Galaga t-shirts.
291997	300182	Numerous Pac-Man t-shirts, including a Pac-Man cushion for a chair.
300563	301903	Anything new, like Tekken?
303725	303865	No.
304385	305926	I want a Pac-Man ghostie.
306687	308748	I actually do have a Pac-Man plushie.
309361	310302	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
338223	338544	DarkSakura
350140	356683	There's several things going on, although some of this also floats the international scene, I should say.
356783	359545	Well, you know, a lot of times the news does.
359565	361066	The stuff we talk about here happens there.
361086	363967	Stuff that happens there goes on over here, so it's inevitable.
364347	372952	Well, Scott Henson of Microsoft is basically going through considerations on how to improve the Xbox 360 dashboard and multimedia.
374012	379095	Actually, this sort of stems from some of the results of the PS3's online interface.
380876	386602	They've basically left the dashboard for the 360 as something that is infinitely upgradable.
387323	387903	Smart.
388524	400156	They have been taking the suggestions of those people on Xbox Live who've been turning them in and are trying to put more features on there that the Xbox market will want.
401198	409190	Something I learned this week, when you set a picture as your background, I'd like to be able to set different pictures for different pages in the dashboard.
409250	412234	So if anybody from Microsoft is listening, that would be my suggestion.
412294	414117	Allow more customization in that aspect.
414417	416000	It doesn't cost me points, thank you.
416417	420639	Well, there is a comment on here just to quote.
421179	422940	You said the capability is there.
423000	426242	There are all kinds of features that have come in.
426802	432945	One of the top requested features is the ability to download from the marketplace in the background, so we're looking at it and prioritizing that list of requests.
434145	436747	You basically didn't comment on anything in particular.
436787	445591	They're also talking about their HD specifications, how they want to keep it high, but they're going to keep it in the level that most listeners are focusing on.
447439	448779	Not listeners, players.
449840	451300	Sorry, I'm thinking of our listeners.
451820	452360	I love you all.
453960	454221	Alright.
455561	463062	You know, there's also mentioned consideration of Blu-ray, but I don't know that they're necessarily going to be looking into it.
464023	467143	Honestly, I'm tired of hearing about all the Blu-ray rumors.
467343	469364	Versus HD DVD and blah blah blah.
469404	469704	Yeah.
470844	475085	Also, something that we did touch on earlier, there are going to be
475589	477933	Mega Drive Games on the Revolution
487677	492400	So we are going to be seeing Genesis Mega Drive games on the Revolution available.
492881	495782	They call it the Virtual Console.
496503	505089	We'll feature NES Super Nintendo games, TurboGrafx, and backwards compatible GameCube through the disk drive.
506510	507010	But Sega...
508514	513196	We actually have a quote from Nalia Tsurumi, who is the CEO of Sega America and Sega Europe.
514116	520419	Sega's support of the virtual console system will introduce more gamers to the classic Mega Drive hits and reinvigorate many of our popular brands.
520759	521219	That's interesting.
521239	523080	Now, why did they release it with two separate names?
523120	524721	Why did they rebrand it the Genesis here?
524841	525641	Do you know?
525781	527221	Because I didn't follow that whole saga.
527362	528042	This was years ago.
528382	528882	I don't know.
529002	531323	It has to be part of a marketing deal or whatever.
532383	534244	For example, Sega CD was the Mega CD.
535945	536345	It's just
537331	538451	How they did it, alright, whatever.
540692	545014	So you're up, folks, whenever we're talking about, you know, hooray, Sega Genesis games are compatible.
545514	548635	Just know that for you, replace Genesis with Mega Drive, and you're good.
548895	550355	Remember, Sega does what Nintendo does.
550776	551236	Oh, stop.
551356	551776	Moving on.
553517	554697	Guess what game's going to be on the DS?
556173	558275	Well, I already know because I looked at the outline for tonight.
559135	560036	Play along!
561157	562659	I don't know, DarkSakura.
562699	564661	What game will be playable on the DS?
564721	565441	A gun game!
565622	566122	Oh, right.
566142	566562	I like guns.
566582	567103	But not really.
568144	570146	Point Blank is going to be out on the DS.
571067	572728	I was hoping for Wild Gunman.
574190	574550	No, I won't.
574590	575391	Or Hogan's Alley.
575411	576111	Gangster Town.
576492	576732	Anyway.
576812	579415	From the Master System since we've been talking about Sega.
579595	580536	Point Blank was cool, too.
581526	582587	I really dig Point Blank.
583048	586031	But basically, instead of using the light gun, you're going to use the stylus.
586071	586911	Tap on the screen.
587312	588813	You have your arcade mode.
589934	595860	You have 40 different sequences that are going to be coming up from the arcade in the PlayStation games.
595900	600825	You'll shoot clay pigeons, cardboard cutouts, aliens, everything.
601205	602126	Little bouncing balls.
602639	603700	Pac-Man, not really.
604601	604981	All right.
605341	612328	There's a wireless multiplayer mode that's going to work with one card, a high score free play mode, a few others.
614269	620175	There's going to be a mode called Brain Massage, which analyzes and offers feedback as you play.
621136	622337	Brain training, anyone?
622857	624579	The other is called Games Museum.
625980	628542	Kind of on the wording there, but...
630043	634966	It's basically adapted older point-blank levels.
635326	636967	I think that's kind of an interesting concept.
636987	641010	I'm surprised we haven't seen this yet, or at least if it's been out, I haven't heard of it, so sorry.
641670	643511	Like a gun game with the stylus.
643591	646713	I'm kind of surprised it's taken us this long to get there.
646733	653538	You know what I'd like to see is the Gun Survivor series, the Biohazard Gun Survivor series with the stylus.
654819	668195	You know, I actually really enjoyed playing, because when we went to Las Vegas way back when on the DDR Freak Moderator's trip, I got to play Biohazard Gun Survivor 2, which was the one set in the Code Veronica universe, and that was cool.
668875	670557	It was always, you controlled it with the gun.
670778	670958	Mm-hmm.
671536	678558	I always thought they should have a game like that on the DS where you're controlling it and then using your D-pad to shoot too.
678859	681660	But no one ever listens to my suggestions in the video game industry.
681940	687542	I had a GunCon, which is strange because I usually don't collect a lot of the accessories, but I did have a GunCon.
687582	688242	I like Point Blank.
688282	689462	I have my GunCon too.
691283	694864	I actually have the upgraded GunCon because I wanted to get Vampire Knight.
695785	696225	I never did.
696785	697025	Oh well.
698405	699946	And besides that, it's all about House of the Dead.
701207	703568	So, there's a little bit more.
704828	714570	There was an announcement by Nintendo and British Telecom saying that there are going to be over 600 Wi-Fi hotspots for the DS and other Wi-Fi capable units.
715230	726833	Nintendo UK and BT Open Zone announced that they are going to have these hotspots open up to retailers across the UK and Ireland.
727393	735724	The hotspots are going to provide these retailers and their customers with ways to use the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection service.
737106	744596	There's also going to be different playable demos, movies of upcoming titles, sort of how we saw at E3.
745754	749057	Game, GameStation, HMV, Toys R Us, Smith's Toys, and other different retailers across the area.
749157	751579	Games to be initially included in downloads, Polarium, Meteos, and
766704	769125	You get to meet Miyamoto's Nintendog Pick.
770805	772505	Upcoming downloads in April and May.
772565	782567	They're going to be Pokemon Link, Trauma Center Under the Knife, Dr. Kalashima's Brain Training, How Old is Your Brain, other playables.
782607	789689	There's going to be special items for Animal Crossing and a special Metroid Prime Hunters movie.
790666	792268	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
815289	816610	Wi-Fi is cool and all.
816910	823272	There's something about having that feedback in person of somebody going, Oh, you bastard, you killed me.
823292	827634	Keep in mind those demos only stay on your system as long as your system is not turned off.
827754	828334	Well, that's true.
829874	832275	I remember E3, we downloaded the Meteos demo.
832916	836617	My buddy Brad and I downloaded the Meteos demo, went back to the hotel that night and played all night long.
836697	837197	It was awesome.
837297	839538	Well, see, I actually downloaded Electroplankton.
840442	841703	See, I was never able to get that game.
841723	843223	I was never ever able to get that game.
843323	845184	Like, it was always full whenever I tried to grab it.
845204	848205	I was playing Electroplankton in the line to get into the PlayStation 3.
848245	850386	Oh yeah, that's cool.
850866	858649	But I think that, you know, it's a really cool thing, I think, that Nintendo's doing by having all these various hot spots.
859789	869513	Not only is it opening more places for gamers to get the new stuff as it comes out, making it available, it's offering more interactivity among gamers, I think.
870499	880542	The closest thing I've seen to this, besides of course those game cafes, is I was at a coffee shop not too long ago and saw three people with a laptop playing Quake.
882083	883924	That's cool.
884024	893847	Also, not to say it's the very least, but we have the last segment in our UK news, which is release date!
894327	896948	Alright, what kind of cool stuff is coming out for the UK folks?
897387	901431	On the 30th, we have Brick Amal and Funny Cards on the Game Boy Advance.
901691	904253	We have Animal Crossing coming out on the 31st.
904674	905394	About time.
906075	911459	You know, I really hope that the friend code thing works internationally because I've got a bunch of people on there.
911479	913221	I'm going to be making room for new people.
914082	916063	So I'd definitely like to play with some of our UK listeners.
916784	921708	Also, Armored Core 9 Breaker on PS2, Battle of Europe, Condemned Criminal Origins.
922469	923410	Condemned is a pretty neat game.
924036	949408	CSI, Three Dimensions of Murder, Desperados 2, Far Cry, Instincts Evolution, and Predator Ice Age 2, the Meltdown video game, we have Odama, Outrun 2006, love Outrun Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney, grab it while you can Resident Evil, Deadly Silence, Tales of Fantasia, which actually excites me That's where all our copies of Phoenix Wright went, they went over to Europe
951722	957712	Also, there's a tie three, Night of the Quincon, and Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter.
958874	959154	All right.
960376	960737	Very cool.
960777	962420	Lots of stuff to look forward to over there in the UK.
962540	963341	Lots of good stuff.
963602	963862	All right.
964002	964243	Outrun.
965261	965981	How about the U.S.?
966282	967402	What's coming up in the U.S.?
968723	969843	Fun stuff, of course.
970343	972984	Of course we've got... Kingdom Hearts 2 and Beatmania.
973084	975145	Yes, Kingdom Hearts 2 and Beatmania.
975165	976026	That's on my list, yes.
976986	979447	We do have some other games, of course.
980207	982948	Far Cry Instinct's Predator, if you're having a 360.
983269	988371	Rumble Roses XX, which should be girl-tastic.
988591	993813	And there's also going to be Full Spectrum Warrior 10 Hammers on PlayStation 2 and Xbox.
994690	995591	GameCubeFans
1023925	1025969	Harvest Moon Magic Melody.
1026290	1028053	Yet another Harvest Moon game.
1028234	1029616	Cows and sheep and puppies.
1030197	1033865	I don't hear a lot about GameCube games anymore, which is kind of sad.
1033885	1034646	About two a month.
1035668	1035949	Too bad.
1036403	1050691	Orange Launch Radio started as a station dedicated to music and rhythm video games, so of course we like to keep tabs on what's going on in that scene, because of course a lot of our listeners that have been listening to us for the four years we've been going expect it once in a while.
1050711	1051791	We're going to talk about music news.
1052452	1055473	So, Loki, some news going on with In The Groove this week, right?
1055794	1059155	Yeah, In The Groove is having their PC beta right now.
1059656	1065759	You can actually go download it off their beta website and you can play a two-song demo.
1067461	1070464	Now, haven't I played this beta before when it was called Stepmania?
1071485	1072285	You may have.
1073006	1073647	Just curious.
1073827	1079472	Ironically enough, I did poke around the data files on there, and yep, it is Stepmania.
1080112	1091363	Okay, to set this up for folks who may not know what we're talking about here, In the Groove is a DDR-like game that came out, and it's based off a PC...
1092546	1096229	simulator for DDR that's a few years old called Stepmania.
1096529	1100411	They got together with the folks that made Stepmania and out came In The Groove.
1100731	1121385	But now you're saying when you poked around these files, you found that... Okay, basically the way it is set up here, they have, instead of having all your sim files and everything in there, they have a directory of pack files or PCK files, and there's one file that's an index file for that that basically tells the program how to unzip everything and extract it so you can play it.
1121909	1126751	And that way you can't go and mess around the files because they're encrypted and compressed.
1127591	1130612	But when you look at the index file, you notice a couple things.
1130792	1138094	First off, they actually have .sm on the files.
1138455	1144557	And the best part about this, you know how they have in StepMania when you're doing edits and stuff, and it'll have...
1146806	1150888	Your directory, your folder, you can switch between different folders and stuff to edit songs.
1150928	1154070	Well, they still left it in there in the Groove Beta.
1154690	1161114	They left in the folder stuff so you can actually see what looks exactly like the StepMania step editor.
1161914	1164716	Now, this is an early build, though, right?
1164756	1166317	They may take some of this out or what?
1166497	1169299	I guess they could, but... Or it could be a marketing tool.
1169359	1170159	Hey, make your own songs.
1170179	1173441	I just hope they're playing non-selling this because I don't see the point.
1174394	1177801	Well, DDR came out on the PC and a lot of people didn't see the point of that.
1177821	1184135	Yeah, but it's not based on a game that's been out there already or a program that's been out there already that's free.
1185259	1190081	You know actually how I think that Rockstar could sell more copies of this?
1190622	1192362	Make this PC release coming up.
1192422	1193683	If they're doing this, make it into Groove 2.
1194283	1196524	Release it for the PC before you release it on consoles.
1196824	1198585	Some people will buy them both, just to have them both.
1198745	1200686	Well, here's the cool thing about it.
1200846	1207049	You can make edits and transfer them to USB drive, so you can actually go and play your edits on the arcade.
1207069	1212512	I guess that's kind of cool, but I think you can pretty much do that anyways if you have step mania.
1213499	1215040	I think there's a way to do it, yeah.
1215301	1217542	So, I don't know.
1218323	1229552	Okay, well, remember, remember, we are, and some of our listeners, too, our listeners that are music game oriented, put yourself in these shoes, we are a minority of the gaming public at large.
1229672	1242162	A lot of the gaming public has no idea that Stepmania even exists, and when they see this on store shelves, I might be a parent buying this for my kid going, oh, I want my kid to get fit, and I don't have a console, but I have a PC.
1243022	1245283	So, that's where this game's going to sell.
1245343	1247083	I don't think it's going to really sell amongst the hardcore.
1247103	1247763	Let me put it this way.
1248723	1249404	Same thing with DDR.
1249424	1251204	I always said the exact same thing about DDR PC.
1252344	1257366	The only reason to have that... I mean, it's a crappy release compared to most of the console ones.
1257606	1267948	The only reason to have it is for... A, all the downloadable characters, like Mr. Spanky, and B, to have it on the PC when you don't have a console in your house.
1268008	1270189	Like, if you're a family that doesn't have a console in your house.
1270289	1271589	So, I mean, it's just...
1272909	1275771	It's very lazy to me, to be honest.
1275931	1283774	I don't know, it's just... Well, if you're willing to check it out, if you want to check it out, here's where you gotta go.
1283934	1295059	Just go to www.inthegroove.com slash page slash ITG underscore PC underscore Mac underscore demo underscore beta.
1295948	1297169	if that's easy enough for you guys.
1297649	1309719	And you'll fill out a nice little survey and you'll download a torrent file where you can download the actual beta, which might take a little bit of time because apparently the torrent speeds are pretty slow.
1309839	1312021	Mine went pretty quick, but I don't know.
1312221	1318045	I played it and immediately when I played the game, I tried it out to see if it's anything special.
1318886	1321228	It just reinforced the fact why I don't like In the Groove.
1321308	1323370	So, I don't know.
1323850	1325031	Go ahead, check it out.
1325390	1327111	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1348147	1360798	But now what may be a little bit of a surprise is that if you trace the big corporate structure, Sony somewhat funds the Spider-Man franchise, so you would think it would be a PS3 exclusive, but not really.
1360878	1361739	It's not the way it's going to go.
1361779	1365582	Where there's money to be made, they will release the games.
1366123	1366883	So that's that.
1368625	1372048	Loki, you also have another release news information?
1372488	1373048	Yeah, 99 Nights.
1374096	1381300	which is another kind of Dynasty Warriors-ish game that's out in Japan right now is going to be coming to the US in the fall.
1381940	1382801	And that should be pretty cool.
1382881	1384041	Looks like a pretty decent game.
1384762	1386743	Does that mean we'll finally get the demo one of these days?
1388064	1391165	Yeah, well, actually the demo just needs to hit on live.
1391425	1396008	Right now they're just offering it as like on the CD only or DVD only.
1396508	1401631	So as soon as that hits on live, then yeah, you can actually probably play the demo here in the States.
1401731	1403652	But I don't know.
1404181	1405603	Until then, we just need more games.
1422580	1426384	Moving on, we're going to get into another story here.
1426484	1428966	DarkSakura, you have another release information.
1429307	1430188	Actually, I do.
1430448	1432370	Normally, I hold off.
1432930	1435833	I only mention the releases that are coming out in the following week.
1436194	1443581	For the UK releases, I do have one to add, though, that was brought to my attention by our long-time listener, Simmel, who's actually listening right now at 4, 5, 6 a.m.
1446001	1446601	That's hardcore.
1446761	1448803	Yeah, that is hardcore.
1449403	1453485	Guitar Hero is actually getting a UK release on 7th of April for £50.
1455557	1459080	It's getting a lot, a lot, it still gets a lot, a lot of coverage.
1459320	1460381	Well, it's expensive here too.
1460701	1464944	Yeah, I'm almost... But that comparably is more expensive than it was here.
1465444	1480335	Don't get me wrong, I think Guitar Hero is a great game, but at the same time, I'm really starting to get sick of hearing about it all the time, and how revolutionary it is when you kind of think... Keep in mind, we've had it for a while, they haven't had it yet, they're
1480782	1481302	No, I know, no, no.
1483103	1487124	The mention of this makes me think about how saturated Guitar Hero is over here right now.
1487724	1494786	And don't get me wrong, it's a great game and all, but, you know, it doesn't... It's not that revolutionary.
1494826	1499648	It's not that revolutionary to me, because we've had Guitar Freaks, we've had Frequency, we've had Amplitude.
1501248	1507710	The only thing that kind of sold this game was the fun element of it and the way they kind of tied it all together.
1508186	1518341	I'm glad that it is coming out of here because I feel a lot of people have missed out on it because I really enjoy it.
1518662	1519263	Got our second guitar now.
1521684	1524227	I know, I've seen that they sell the guitars separately, too.
1524247	1526490	They have a red one that costs like $10 more.
1526650	1530675	I bet Konami's kicking their butts right now for not releasing Guitar Freaks here a couple years ago.
1531115	1534279	Should have had more faith in music games over here, Konami Japan.
1535801	1539305	Anyway, there's another game that we're going to be seeing at E3.
1540527	1540827	What's that?
1541175	1548438	BioWare is going to have some stuff out for an Xbox 360 RPG called Mass Effect.
1550139	1563706	So they're saying, though, it's speculated either this year or next, it's going to have players who form bands of adventurers and go on and, you know, kick alien butt in the future.
1564526	1566507	You know, go around different planets, explore them.
1566607	1567868	Pillage as you roam!
1569129	1571231	Go to different solar systems, different places.
1573672	1587621	BioWare spoke to IGN during the Game Developers Conference and said that prior to the battles, which are going to be in real time, players can get together and make strategies, can swap characters when the fights go on.
1589622	1595406	You have your different types of characters, your typical ones, like your long, short range, your healer, blah, blah, blah.
1596064	1598586	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1623499	1624299	I know, I know, it's great.
1624479	1630702	Well, you know, because I'm crossing my fingers and my toes that we are going to get the media thing after all, so we get to go in a little bit early.
1631283	1636805	I'm thinking, I'm pretty much going to burn that time waiting in line for Nintendo Revolution, because I know that is the first place I want to go.
1636885	1637626	Press doesn't have to wait.
1638286	1638606	No, we don't.
1640595	1641315	Shit, cool.
1642956	1643376	I didn't know.
1643577	1644197	Well, I'm hoping.
1644277	1649099	I'm crossing my fingers and my toes we get to see it because I really want to share with you guys all about that.
1649119	1651440	And of course, we will be broadcasting from E3.
1651881	1656603	Still working out some details, but you can look forward to daily podcasts just like we did last year.
1656663	1658084	I want to be able to broadcast.
1658384	1659684	I told you so.
1659924	1660745	That's what I'm hoping.
1660765	1664287	Well, the listeners might be the ones broadcasting back to you, buddy.
1664327	1665147	You better be careful.
1665799	1668080	Alright, anyway, moving on to another story.
1668600	1671962	You were talking in the first half, Loki, about you've been playing Elder Scrolls for Oblivion.
1672322	1674143	Now, the game's already broken.
1674943	1679625	You were talking about a bug earlier where you couldn't jump in a certain point of the game.
1679986	1682847	You stuck because you were floating on a rock or something.
1683147	1684868	But what else is broken in Oblivion?
1685668	1694132	Well, sometimes the load times tend to be extremely long, and this is because the hard drive, it caches the game to the hard drive so that it
1694805	1698528	Loads faster and plays faster, but sometimes it gets fragmented.
1699149	1705214	However, at least they figured out that that's possible and what they did is built in a fix for it.
1705274	1719967	So if you do have that happen where your load times are excruciatingly long, what you need to do is actually hold down the A button when you reset the game and let it boot up to the title screen and that's it.
1720768	1722129	So, pretty simple, but...
1722990	1724151	Dark Sakura Dark Sakura Dark Sakura
1761815	1787992	The review of the week goes to Tequila Oh Tequila, how you make me suffer You make my stomach hurt worse than anything in the universe ever does Anything less than Patron is not worth drinking Oh how I hate thee Dear Tequila, die Not love, DarkSakura Alright, I'm laughing because I was there that night You were there
1790562	1795686	Also an F you to cheap sour mix, but mostly to cheap tequila.
1796827	1802111	You know what, Jason was telling me that he's regretting not taking pictures of you passed out because it would have been pretty funny now.
1802431	1802712	What?
1803752	1804833	I, okay, you know.
1804873	1808436	He didn't get any, but he told me he regrets not taking any.
1808736	1808976	What?
1810317	1811458	Okay, I, alright.
1811478	1813340	Admit it, it would be funny in context.
1813360	1817383	To explain, I have insanely good alcohol tolerance.
1818172	1821674	However, I have zero tolerance when it comes to cheap tequila.
1822014	1831378	On top of it, I think I'm somewhat allergic to it because I woke up with a rash on my neck, which I only get a rash on my neck if I've had something, if I've consumed something I'm allergic to.
1832519	1833560	So I think I'm allergic to tequila.
1834540	1836021	You know, we haven't done a drunk show in a while.
1836201	1836361	No.
1837003	1837844	Get off your high horse, asshole.
1864023	1864284	What?
1864384	1866086	I have a designated driver to pick me up every time.
1866186	1866566	Always.
1866786	1867147	Always.
1867327	1868248	We do it safe.
1868308	1869329	So, I don't know.
1869369	1869970	I just had to get that.
1869990	1870971	That's another FU.
1871191	1871632	FU to a...
1873132	1885285	I actually am here, but as far as my, I've been, you've seen me drink on the show, and the one time I got sick on the show from drinking was with that cheap tequila that was sitting on top of your refrigerator at the old apartment.
1885525	1886666	That stuff was nasty.
1886686	1887527	What was cheap?
1888789	1892332	I was drinking that tequila, and I finished, what, a fourth of the bottle?
1892933	1894495	And then I got really sick and ate waffles.
1895154	1896295	Oh, thank you, Chatroom.
1896315	1897476	Chatroom makes an excellent point here.
1897536	1900999	GK128 says Dignation was taped at the bar two weeks ago.
1901379	1905282	And I know that This Week in Tech has done shows at pubs and stuff.
1905322	1908885	So that guy can go take a flying leap.
1909145	1910006	What channel was it?
1910066	1923497	I was watching a show where it was like some science experiment show where they had people going out and taking them to the pub to get smashed off their butt and then go the next day and find out what was the best hangover cure.
1926222	1927203	We always set limits.
1927423	1928824	Be safe about it.
1928844	1931045	Because it's expensive.
1931305	1933406	I think now we have to set a date to do another one.
1933446	1934947	Just defy these negative reviews.
1934967	1936108	Let's fight our next three-day weekend.
1936248	1941912	And reaffirm our independence from these corporate non-drinking entities.
1942332	1942732	You know what?
1942752	1948516	The only way for me to actually be significantly drunk on the show is if I put down the $16 and get a couple bottles of Chimay.
1948556	1950597	Well, then we'll just all have to chip in and make it happen.
1950978	1951518	Well, I'm going to.
1952412	1956255	That is the, uh, for the record, that is the only beer that will have me drunk in one pint.
1956435	1957596	Alright, we gotta keep moving, we gotta keep moving.
1957616	1958437	Let's get to the game segments.
1958497	1959678	Uh, Loki, you're FU real quick.
1960579	1966744	Um, just a stupid driver, because I've seen too many people today, like, going in the wrong direction on the road.
1968125	1969406	Was it like, you know, when we're at lunch?
1969426	1970587	Are you sure you just weren't playing a lot of Mario?
1970607	1974170	No, when we're going, when we're at lunch, you know, the women trying to back up.
1974691	1976612	Oh, yeah, the, the chick that was trying to back up.
1976632	1977993	Yeah, yeah, that was, that was kind of crazy.
1978174	1979495	And just, you know, I don't know.
1981317	2007150	my F you would have to be having to be sober while everyone else I was with literally everyone I was with Friday night was drunk but I had to be sober because it's very responsible to have a sober driver but next time it will not be me mark my words it will not be me next time somebody else gets to play alright that's it moving on next segment
2008896	2011478	Our next story, we're going to go over to me.
2012879	2015221	And we're going to talk about the Video Game Voter Network.
2015261	2017702	We mentioned this on a previous podcast last week.
2017722	2019183	We were talking about the Video Game Voters Network.
2019543	2020264	It just launched.
2020284	2021765	Well, get this.
2022726	2024767	20,000 messages were sent to U.S.
2024827	2027649	Senators in just a week of this network being up.
2027949	2030991	So you guys really took action on this really quickly.
2031491	2036495	And, of course, something we may not have mentioned last week because it wasn't exactly clear to us at that time...
2036955	2038736	But the ESA does have a hand in this.
2038776	2046219	This is, I believe, the ESA, kind of their response to all this stuff going on is to really mobilize the gaming community.
2046500	2048040	But I stand by what I said last week.
2048080	2052322	It's a smart idea, and if you're sick of all this stuff, you've got to do something about it, right?
2052362	2055084	Just like the kid we were talking about in the first half that was getting sued.
2055304	2057505	If you want to make change, you've got to do something about it.
2057985	2062647	Also, what I thought was interesting is that on the site now, they actually have a letter from Will Wright.
2063368	2064288	Will Wright, of course, made...
2065234	2066434	Many, many classic games.
2066675	2068375	He's working on that Spore thing now.
2068415	2070076	Which is freaking awesome.
2070176	2072336	This hugely comprehensive game.
2072416	2073577	This is going to be insane.
2074977	2078318	Will Wright actually posted a letter to the site there urging people to join.
2078478	2085201	So if you don't want to join Video Game Voters Network because we told you to, then consider Will Wright's opinion for a minute.
2085441	2087201	Because that man's made a lot of great stuff.
2088942	2091683	Alright, let's go over now to...
2094551	2097513	Loki, who has a story speaking of legal things.
2097533	2101554	You've got to file patents when you're going to do new stuff, and sometimes it tells us what's coming up.
2101614	2102015	Right, Loki?
2102355	2123264	Yeah, well, the story that actually came out this week about the PSP keyboard, it's actually kind of... There was a patent for a keyboard that was going to be used via the USB port on the PSP, which is kind of retarded when you think about it, because that would mean that the keyboard is above the monitor when you're typing, so...
2123806	2125307	That would be completely awkward.
2125887	2128668	But that was one of the things that came out.
2128748	2132149	And they had kind of like a cell phone little doohickey on there.
2132869	2136391	So I don't know if that's something that they're still working on.
2137151	2143373	But this was actually, I think, shown at E3 a couple years ago, I want to say, when they originally showed the PSP.
2143413	2145834	I want to say that this was one of the things that they showed.
2145934	2148175	Or maybe it was at one of the shows.
2148555	2150336	And they had actual pictures of it that I've seen.
2151516	2152297	But I don't think it's anything.
2152317	2153877	They're probably going to change it some.
2154558	2155679	But that was interesting.
2155779	2159801	However, there was another patent, though, that was filed that I thought was pretty interesting.
2160301	2165865	And that would be by Take-Two for Vice City Stories, the next PSP Grand Theft Auto game.
2166185	2166685	Hoo-yah.
2168186	2169547	We think, right?
2169727	2172749	I mean, it's speculation, but they have filed a patent on this name.
2172909	2173730	Well, trademark.
2173750	2174850	Sorry, trademark on the name.
2175211	2175991	You can't patent a name.
2176011	2177192	Sorry, even I should know that.
2178293	2178913	All right, interesting.
2180287	2183769	Moving on, I got a story here on Windows Vista.
2184589	2189150	Of course, this is going to be the next, you know, like XP, the next version of Windows.
2189891	2200755	Get this, if you want to be playing games on Windows Vista, they're saying that you're going to have to have two gigs of RAM in order to play games on Windows Vista.
2201355	2206737	They're saying that 900 meg seems to be the bare minimum to even use like Word or PowerPoint.
2207045	2213307	If you want to play Halo 2 or any of that stuff, you're going to have to have 2 gigs of RAM to play on Windows Vista.
2214008	2220410	I suppose a little bit of this is rumor right now, but we'll see for sure when the system comes out.
2220430	2227913	All I can say is that I guess I'm glad I did upgrade this system to 2 gigs of RAM, so that if I decide to get Windows Vista, I'll be okay and good to go.
2228573	2230034	Loki had another quick story on the Vista, though.
2230526	2238209	Yeah, there was a rumor that it was being reprogrammed, or the code was being reprogrammed by the Xbox team, and that rumor was, of course, debunked.
2238569	2241070	Or at least, Microsoft is saying no, that's not the case.
2241150	2242850	So, take it as a rumor.
2242870	2243450	I don't know.
2244691	2244871	Okay.
2245598	2246238	You know what's interesting?
2246479	2258146	That program that I downloaded onto the computer to allow my Xbox to get the pictures and stuff from the network for my 360, the program actually looks like the Xbox 360 when you launch it.
2258226	2260127	It makes your desktop look like the Xbox 360.
2260967	2263249	It's kind of cute that they have that consistency going on.
2264870	2265250	Interesting.
2266013	2268394	I'm really looking forward to getting my Mac now, even more.
2270014	2274075	You know, they do have a program for the Mac that'll let you connect with your 360.
2274335	2276515	I think it's called Connect360, I think is the name of it.
2277736	2280176	I don't think it does everything, but it'll do the songs and stuff.
2280216	2281316	I think it costs money, though.
2281416	2282777	I don't know if it's totally free.
2283017	2288178	The one thing, though, I'm going to be happy about my Mac is running virtual PC so I can still play Ragnarok.
2288258	2288438	Mm-hmm.
2288985	2291326	because Ragnarok will run just fine on virtual PC.
2292426	2294127	And then run everything else that I need to.
2294487	2295747	I can play World of Warcraft.
2296508	2299449	I can actually even do podcasting.
2299469	2302990	You're going to have to get hooked up with GarageBand, the new one.
2303190	2305431	It's very intricate when it comes to podcasting.
2305471	2307471	I've tried to look at what we can do for this show with it.
2308012	2314974	I'm also going to start using whatever their broadcaster is for Pump of Volume, which will be this week.
2315626	2316046	Xtifer Xtifer
2337920	2346327	Xtifer, did you go to a big deal concert this week?
2347328	2348209	Yes, I did.
2348389	2349390	First off, welcome to the show.
2349730	2350210	Thank you.
2350511	2351892	And you guys are speaking of me?
2351972	2353713	Yes, your ears must have been burning.
2353974	2355435	Did you start sneezing a lot?
2356135	2356376	No.
2357216	2358918	When's your show coming back, your spin-off show?
2360087	2362309	Um, I'm thinking maybe in a couple weeks.
2362569	2367813	And if you think we're politically incorrect on this show, oh my gosh, listen to X for a show some night, because he doesn't even really talk about games.
2367833	2369034	Do you ever talk about games on your show?
2369574	2370755	I can talk about video games.
2370775	2372436	Alright, well you need to talk about video games tonight.
2372757	2373437	What happened?
2373717	2377840	You got to do something video game related that myself, Loki, DarkSakura, none of us got to do.
2377880	2378301	What did you do?
2378641	2384666	I went to Video Games Live, which was a concert in San Jose that they put on.
2386147	2389149	And basically it's a bunch of video game
2390014	2393677	Music that is live with an orchestra.
2395038	2397019	There was a choir there.
2397240	2403685	And also, I guess that one guy from that one show was hosting it.
2404065	2406767	Tommy Tallarico, yeah.
2407067	2413913	I don't know all of their names, but I can say that all of the music that they played was very beautiful.
2413973	2417135	They played pieces from World of Warcraft.
2417275	2417696	There was...
2418792	2429519	EverQuest 2, there was Kingdom Hearts, there was Zelda, there was Mario, there was Castlevania, apparently there was Metal Gear Solid, which I didn't see because we came in a little bit late.
2429679	2430259	Shame on you.
2430560	2431680	So you missed the Pong.
2432100	2433321	I wanted to know about the Pong.
2433982	2437504	They did Frogger, which wasn't that good.
2437804	2445229	I heard on Bobby Blackwolf's show when he had Tommy Tallarico on that he was saying something about this whole Frogger setup, that they have people play live?
2445469	2446009	What do they do?
2446289	2446850	Yeah, um...
2447833	2454075	They were playing the game live, and the conductor was conducting the music as they were playing the game.
2454115	2455996	So it was like you were hearing the live music.
2456076	2459918	It was a very expensive way to play a game, I guess.
2461338	2462018	They joked about it.
2462919	2464499	Well, didn't they give somebody a laptop for winning?
2464519	2468961	They gave somebody a very nice laptop for winning at Frogger.
2469001	2472843	He wasn't even that good, but he got a very nice laptop.
2473163	2475183	I don't know what it was called, but it was a very nice laptop.
2475303	2476144	Was it Alienware?
2476164	2476544	Is that it?
2476829	2477589	I don't know.
2477609	2477909	Okay.
2478149	2479270	But it was very nice.
2479370	2480530	I have memories of Frogger.
2481430	2482030	That's just weird.
2482050	2482730	It's a cool game.
2483091	2488712	I have memories of being in middle school at the roller rink playing Frogger on roller skates.
2489372	2490372	Did any of it make you cry?
2491313	2491933	You know, it didn't.
2492893	2493993	I was there with my boyfriend.
2494033	2495834	He was crying a little bit at some things.
2496214	2498954	But no, they were... It was very nice.
2498994	2502715	And we sat like three seats, three aisles from the front.
2503275	2505656	So we had very good seats and...
2506361	2507481	The Conductor was funny.
2507601	2508602	That Tommy guy wasn't.
2510782	2517204	Basically, as somebody that doesn't play a lot of video games, I really do like the music.
2517384	2522805	I see it as the same as music from motion pictures because it's just the same thing.
2522865	2526666	It just scores like they are scoring a movie.
2527686	2531027	I've always liked soundtrack music.
2531707	2533948	I was kind of in my own
2536102	2543288	I was very well... I thought it was a very well done thing that they did.
2543909	2546451	Alright, well thanks for that little mini review of Video Games Live.
2547572	2550694	Now this is touring, so would you recommend our listeners go see it?
2550775	2551475	I think it's touring.
2551575	2553557	It was touring and it wasn't touring.
2553737	2555358	I'm pretty sure they'll do more shows of this though.
2555539	2557620	Yeah, I think it's really cool.
2557640	2559081	I think a lot of people would be interested.
2559142	2562304	If you like Halo, they did a huge thing from Halo at the end.
2562344	2562985	It was the finale.
2563685	2567126	and they had the actual guy who composed the music that was there.
2567386	2571147	And they also had the guy, they had a lot of video game composers in the audience.
2571207	2577388	Well, you know that you were at the show during a really big week in video gaming in Santa Fe, right?
2577428	2577809	Right, right.
2577869	2578189	Okay.
2578449	2583890	Well, apparently they had the big gaming thing in the same place as we went.
2584370	2585010	Oh, okay.
2585290	2589311	But they also had the composer to World of Warcraft there.
2589471	2589852	He was there.
2590252	2590952	So that was kind of cool.
2591252	2591512	Oh, cool.
2591532	2591692	Yeah.
2592298	2601184	because when you do play games, that's all you ever play I was in my element favorite song that they played all night?
2603825	2620116	I think I would say Advent Rising I've never played the game, I've heard that it's not that good but I thought that the music was gorgeous it's a great game, it just has really horrible frame rate issues so, yeah
2620908	2621148	All right.
2621228	2622209	Maybe we'll have to check that out.
2622409	2623630	Yeah, it was gorgeous.
2624131	2625792	And Kingdom Hearts was very well done, too.
2626312	2627873	Did they do Simple and Clean from Kingdom Hearts?
2628674	2630315	Well, it was the theme to the first game.
2630335	2630936	Oh, that's hot.
2631196	2633818	So, yeah, it did have that Simple and Clean theme.
2633858	2634218	Cool.
2634899	2635139	All right.
2635540	2636181	Thank you, Xfer.
2636241	2636681	Appreciate it.
2636881	2637742	No problemo.
2637982	2638283	All right.
2638303	2641025	We're going to go over to DarkSakura every week.
2641125	2648893	She climbs the Internet up and down and searches to find a great website to share with you guys as her website of the week.
2648913	2653036	So, DarkSakura, where should the kids be pointing their Firefox browsers to this time?
2653056	2655879	Because if they're using Internet Explorer, they really should switch, right?
2656219	2656900	Amen to that.
2656920	2657220	All right.
2658061	2658742	Where should the kids go?
2660632	2664475	Tonight's website of the week is leettech.org.
2664495	2667557	1-3-3-7-T-E-C-H dot org.
2668378	2669018	I love the name.
2669038	2671560	Just the name alone really makes me giggle.
2672341	2684350	But basically, it's a tech site, but it's not like the tech sites that are about big, massive amounts of jargon.
2685250	2688713	To go ahead and quote their About Us page, I'll just read a little bit of this.
2689488	2691929	It's a website for technology and you're currently surfing it.
2691949	2692709	Thank you very much.
2692829	2699091	This site is very much different from the other technology sites for the very reason that we bring technology close to the end user.
2699411	2705814	Many an end user do not want to be bugged by big, high, and mighty terms and would like to understand how a certain technology works and so on and so forth.
2706234	2707294	But what we do is different.
2707354	2709795	We put technology in terms that people understand.
2710175	2717318	We put it into fun, casual manners so expect lots of weird examples and analogies involving toilet bowls and kitchen sinks.
2717458	2718318	That's where we're different.
2718818	2720079	We do not emphasize the news.
2720139	2721440	Websites like Splashdot do that.
2721600	2722981	We do not emphasize on reviews.
2723342	2724903	Websites like Tom's Hardware does that.
2725303	2726544	We emphasize on knowledge.
2726804	2728065	Knowledge for the common end user.
2729226	2732008	So, I thought that was pretty cool.
2732108	2733169	I kind of want to check that out.
2733229	2734870	That's almost like my teaching style, too.
2734911	2738413	When I teach things, I make all these crazy analogies to real life scenarios.
2738433	2739214	This is my day job.
2739294	2741836	I'm a teacher for a business, so kind of interesting.
2742265	2747089	What impresses me is that they have an explanation on what leet and noob are.
2747789	2754695	And to quote this, every article in the site will have a noob-o-meter, and it states how rudimentary the article is about.
2754775	2759378	For example, if the noob-o-meter is at an extreme noob end, then the articles are just perfect for beginners.
2759858	2764002	On the other hand, if the noob-o-meter is at extreme leet end, the article is for more leet users.
2764262	2766223	Warning, extreme noobness ahead.
2766283	2766984	Warning, warning.
2767024	2768565	Remember, because being a noob ain't fun.
2769566	2769866	All right.
2770106	2773948	This site instantly gets my uber kudos.
2774188	2776549	Website of the week, LeakTech1337.
2776589	2777350	Thank you, DarkSakura.
2779171	2782892	Let's go over to Loki, who has some news regarding piracy.
2784053	2785854	Yeah, of course.
2787635	2790656	Basically, I don't know.
2791477	2798100	This whole thing with the 360 and the firmware for the DVD and stuff, just
2799734	2800375	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2824201	2837949	and basically spotted his software for sale legally at a market in Moscow and has basically gotten into a fight with him and now is going to take him to an actual boxing match.
2839910	2846494	Wait, so the developer is actually going to... This is like celebrity boxing on Fox, in a way, is kind of what it reminds me of.
2848114	2848775	In the main event...
2850205	2850585	Fight Night Round 4
2873287	2875428	Out there, some of you have them in your very own PCs.
2875468	2879890	Well, they announced this last week that they have a new design contract with Sony.
2880570	2888574	They're going to get more money than what they earned for creating the graphics processor for the upcoming PlayStation 3 video game console.
2888874	2890755	This deal is going to run through 2007.
2891555	2894477	But the thing is that we don't really know what this chip is for.
2894957	2896878	Could it be possibly about the PSP2?
2898263	2898743	Who knows?
2899103	2903465	They might be bragging about the deal, but they can't talk about the details just yet.
2903565	2905165	So it could be just about anything.
2905225	2910207	So NVIDIA has a deal with Sony to make something, but we don't know what.
2910967	2913868	So I would likely say it's the PSP 2.
2916928	2917209	All right.
2920502	2921142	Thanks for watching!
2945379	2949460	Call Echo 123 first to test your connection to make sure it works.
2949720	2953621	You can also pick up the regular telephone and call us, 916-226-9067.
2954942	2961844	But please keep in mind that that may be a toll call, so please have the phone line owner's permission before you call in.
2963144	2971588	Also, we're going to be moving the Skype line on a bit more permanent basis towards the end of the show in response to recent feedback that our Skype line sometimes gets a little too random.
2971888	2975230	So what we want this to be is more the end of the show kind of open forum.
2975490	2979712	So for our callers to be able to discuss basically whatever is on their mind.
2979972	2984234	There will be a more topical version of interaction that we'll announce in a later week.
2984794	2985334	So here we go.
2985354	2987215	We're going to go ahead and pick up the phone, take our first call.
2987535	2988676	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2990327	2991371	Hi, this is Simmel.
2991833	2992455	Hi, Simmel.
2992495	2993218	What's on your mind, buddy?
2994439	2998621	Just a quick call just about you actually badmouthing the UK.
2999861	3000481	Were we badmouthing?
3000501	3003522	Wait a minute, we're getting video of you here in the studio too.
3003542	3004343	That is crazy.
3004703	3006723	Look at this, we can actually see this guy who's calling in right now.
3006763	3009304	I've never seen that happen on Skype before.
3009404	3009944	That's pretty cool.
3010045	3010745	That's kind of cool.
3011065	3011645	Oh, right on.
3011725	3014506	I'm looking a bit tired because it's like half five now.
3015266	3017247	It's got to be like five or six over there.
3017327	3019128	Alright, what did we do to bash on the UK?
3019188	3020188	I'm sorry bud, what did we do?
3020248	3022669	Just about when Guitar Hero was...
3025013	3025694	Yeah, Guitar Hero?
3027416	3030119	I think the video may be slowing our connection there a little bit.
3030479	3034443	You had a question there in response to Guitar Hero.
3034824	3036646	Were we bashing on it a little bit there, or what?
3037186	3042132	Yeah, just the fact that, yeah, I'm just trying to get rid of it.
3044632	3045453	I gotta let that one go.
3045533	3053576	I'm so sorry, Simul, but we just got really, really bad feedback there, and I think people's speakers exploded during that, so sorry about that.
3053796	3055677	You guys should not bash on the UK.
3055717	3056457	We don't!
3056477	3057358	Shame on you!
3057458	3058018	We weren't!
3058638	3062400	I made a whole segment just to read UK news, thank you.
3062780	3069027	It's probably my fault because I was saying that Guitar Heroes was a little bit... I'm a little sick of it here.
3069067	3072871	But I understand you guys are getting it for the first time over there in the UK.
3073271	3074713	Yes, you should check this game out.
3074773	3078537	It's just that I am getting sick of hearing it in the US.
3078817	3080359	It's time for us to move on.
3080419	3080879	Guess what?
3081100	3081300	What?
3081360	3081880	Guitar Hero.
3084284	3085784	Tell Rob about your newest piece of crack.
3110012	3111433	Oh yes, Advanced Crack.
3111713	3118297	Yeah, I got Advanced Crack DS at, uh, it's, uh, Crack, basically, yes.
3119438	3120298	Advanced Crack DS?
3120318	3121078	Advanced Crack?
3121399	3122920	No, is that Advanced Wars?
3123420	3123660	Yes.
3124340	3125641	Ah, what is so cool about this game?
3127542	3129603	Um, it's fun as hell.
3130544	3132125	I guess hell is fun, yeah.
3132925	3134306	And Crack is Advanced.
3134506	3135567	And Crack is fun.
3135867	3136047	Yeah.
3136187	3136587	For some.
3136868	3139129	It's not regular Crack, it's Advanced Crack.
3139588	3141269	What other DS games are you into, Roz?
3142769	3143369	Phoenix Wright.
3143629	3146150	You all know about my horrible Phoenix Wright addiction.
3146270	3146610	That's right.
3146630	3148511	I remember hearing about that a couple weeks ago on the show.
3148771	3149751	How is Phoenix Wright going?
3149771	3150351	Have you beat it yet?
3151532	3152252	Like four times.
3152612	3152992	Dang!
3153552	3154333	Wow, very cool.
3154953	3157654	Weren't you the one that had to drive a long ways to get it?
3158074	3160194	Yeah, like six hours or so.
3160314	3161415	That is hardcore.
3161575	3164976	So I guess you have to beat a game four times after that type of dedication.
3166336	3168417	Any other feedback to stories we've been talking about tonight, Roz?
3170209	3172230	Uh, tonight, I came in late.
3173051	3177033	Um, but, let's see here.
3177414	3181456	Yeah, I was desperately trying to get my mic to work last week, uh, to talk about the, uh, whole girl gamers issue.
3181476	3181736	Speak up!
3199569	3209661	Um, well, obviously, uh, not being a dude kind of pisses me off how, you know, the negative stereotypes and stuff.
3212484	3215528	And, I don't know, I just don't know what everyone's collective deal is.
3215868	3220053	I mean, you know, it's always a big deal when people find out that I'm not a dude.
3221084	3222385	I don't want to rehash the old conversation.
3251264	3251905	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
3274506	3279310	Sure, there's fat and ugly people that play games, and sure, there's beautiful people that play games, but you know what?
3279590	3286376	Those are the two extremes, and this is what we call a bell curve, and most people are somewhere in between.
3286396	3288718	You know, most of us are just, we're average looking.
3289538	3290419	Yeah, pretty much.
3290699	3295663	You know, I think that SSJ100, Matt actually just said it kind of best in the chat room.
3296284	3298946	You know, most people are like, oh my god, you're a girl, ASL picks please.
3300323	3306226	I get that crap on, not on the current Ragnarok that I'm playing on because people are like, oh, you're cool, you're not a bot.
3307087	3308848	But on IRO, I got it all the time.
3309628	3309888	Wow.
3310629	3316312	Yeah, I moderate at a role-playing forum and all of my characters are male, pretty much.
3317873	3322175	And so when people find out that I'm not a guy, it tends to freak them out.
3322275	3327718	And then I get all these people pouring in on Messenger trying to hit on me.
3328639	3330260	and that's invisible all the time.
3330580	3334061	Don't you get people that assume you must be a lesbian because you play a male character?
3334081	3335362	Because I've heard girls tell me that.
3335442	3335982	I've heard that.
3336402	3337682	Yeah, it's so stupid.
3338143	3338603	So stupid.
3338643	3342424	Then again, how many female characters online are really, you know, boys?
3343144	3343665	Exactly.
3343765	3351668	And we just had the emails from the guys that play the girl characters because they are good characters in the games.
3351748	3354068	It's nothing to do with... It's so silly.
3354569	3355309	Yeah, it is.
3356082	3357642	People need to put stereotypes aside.
3357742	3358623	That's what they need to do.
3359043	3360703	All right, Roz, thank you so much for your call.
3360743	3361363	Appreciate it.
3362043	3362243	Yep.
3362483	3363204	All right, have a good one.
3364204	3364464	Bye.
3364484	3364684	Bye-bye.
3364704	3367605	All right, we're going to go ahead and go to another call here.
3367685	3369125	Let's go to this one.
3369625	3370765	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3372105	3372946	I have sweaty balls.
3373506	3374986	Thank you, my friend.
3375446	3376106	That's nice.
3376967	3380147	What, you've been playing DDR naked again, or what's the deal?
3380427	3381347	My nipples are hard.
3381688	3382248	Shut up.
3385138	3386740	Here's our mature rating for the night!
3415066	3415987	I overrated Guitar Hero?
3417589	3421752	Well, everybody does, but, yeah.
3421792	3425196	How can one overrate one's own personal opinion of the game?
3426257	3429600	Because it doesn't match up with my personal opinion, and my personal opinion is God.
3429960	3431762	I'm gonna hit you with a trap in a second.
3432583	3434645	Okay, so what, you don't like Guitar Hero?
3435686	3437207	No, I like it, it's just overrated.
3437827	3438928	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3457942	3460445	is not a hugely original concept.
3460605	3464249	It's a fusion of two existing concepts in my mind.
3464690	3465951	And that doesn't make it a bad game.
3466132	3467213	I love Guitar Hero.
3467253	3467793	It's a great game.
3468114	3470316	But I'm a little, you know, I'm kind of over it now.
3470537	3471177	You know what I mean?
3471718	3474141	It's time for me to move on to another music game for now.
3474461	3478686	Yeah, I think the reason they got like so high scores though is because they got all that
3479765	3505736	I totally agree and I think Konami made some mistakes in not having more faith in the US audience and spending the money on some higher licenses when they came out here and I take my hats off to Red Octane for recognizing that and Harmonix as well we give Konami a lot of love on this show but we have to give them tough love too when the time is appropriate so
3506400	3508140	Everybody deserves tough love, I guess.
3508421	3508641	I know.
3508821	3510141	Alright, anything else on your mind, Xander?
3512782	3514742	Oh, on the girl gamer thingy.
3514942	3515202	Okay.
3515782	3521184	I just wanted to say, I'm upset as a male asexual that I don't get bashed.
3522184	3522584	Seriously.
3522804	3526145	The gays get bashed, the girls get bashed and crap.
3526565	3527465	Why don't I get bashed?
3527725	3528345	That's not fair.
3528485	3530446	We do secretly bash you.
3530486	3532687	I bash you every night in the chat room.
3533087	3534507	They're all talking about you behind your back.
3535037	3535537	No, no, okay.
3535838	3539541	Wait, define this for me again, because this is a term that a lot of our podcast listeners are probably going, huh?
3539981	3542523	You define yourself as asexual, which means... Yes.
3543865	3545686	It means I'm an amoeba.
3546707	3547488	Are you a eunuch?
3548509	3552772	No, it means that he doesn't think about sex, period.
3552852	3557016	Okay, because if you're a eunuch, I was just going to say, you wouldn't have balls.
3557356	3558457	Okay, just shush.
3558677	3559618	Just quiet over there.
3559898	3560559	Okay, extrovert?
3560959	3561220	All right.
3562210	3567332	Okay, so, well, do you ever get asked in games, like ASL and all this?
3567432	3570133	Do you ever have people try to cyber flirt with you or whatever?
3570753	3572013	In that sense, Coke Music.
3572614	3573354	Coke Music?
3573394	3574534	What happened in Coke Music?
3576115	3577495	Um, I realized it sucked.
3579416	3579576	Why?
3579616	3580036	What happened?
3580056	3581016	Were people hitting on you there?
3582097	3583057	No, it just sucks.
3583157	3583937	It always sucked.
3583977	3584878	I just grew up a little.
3585238	3585878	Okay, okay.
3586718	3591120	Alright, well, can anybody think of a good insult for the asexual gamer?
3591816	3592797	I think I already did.
3593818	3595079	You're a nookiless freak.
3596920	3597700	How's that?
3597740	3598221	Does that count?
3598321	3600482	Does that make you feel better to be bashed there, Xander, a little bit?
3601603	3602004	I guess.
3602204	3603925	Okay, well, we appreciate your call.
3605226	3606567	I don't bash on anybody.
3606827	3610310	Have a good night and have fun not getting late, okay?
3611050	3611310	Okay.
3611370	3611811	All right, later.
3612651	3613492	Let's go to one more call.
3615342	3616863	Alright, we better set aside 10 minutes.
3616923	3617763	Zaku's on the line.
3617843	3618723	Zaku, what's on your mind?
3618963	3619283	Yes.
3620084	3629167	Remember that link I sent you last week about how MTV interviewed this DDR player from around my area?
3629187	3633929	I just want to know whether or not you got a chance to even look at it.
3634789	3635749	I'm going to be honest, I didn't.
3637110	3637430	Alright.
3638150	3639971	Send me the link and post it in chat.
3641051	3641371	I will.
3641391	3643492	I'll post it again, but honestly, you know...
3644275	3650256	If you take a look at it, you know, and personally I think, you know, MTV did a good job in doing it.
3650316	3660599	I wouldn't say they did the best, but it's not like, you know, they didn't do a lame-ass attempt in trying to, you know, trying to feed on the stereotype of DDR being a healthy thing.
3661579	3663119	Okay, set this up for me a little bit, Zaku.
3663159	3663879	What is in this clip?
3663939	3665820	If I watch this clip, what am I going to get?
3666520	3671301	You're going to see, you know, a DDR player by the name of Anthony, also known as Sketch.
3672020	3676602	He's one of the best DDR players in the city and he was interviewed by MTV for Overdrive.
3676682	3679643	Basically, you're going to see a lot of the perspective of the hardcore DDR player.
3679663	3682464	The one who basically goes after scores and just goes after perfecting...
3697233	3697873	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3718055	3720057	I say get the British guy back on the line.
3720177	3721138	I know, he didn't call back.
3721218	3722819	You didn't give him enough time.
3723099	3724360	His thing blew up on me.
3724380	3727963	But British people, their voices are cool.
3728003	3729044	We need more coolness.
3730005	3732547	We've got to go ahead and close the Skype line for now.
3732887	3735950	If he calls in next week, we'll definitely get him again.
3735990	3737511	And he can yell at me more over Guitar Girl.
3737531	3740974	I think it's cool that he stays up until 5, 6 in the morning listening to us.
3741014	3742195	I know, that's dedication.
3742295	3749057	Well, you know that over on All Games where they syndicate us, they play us at like different times of the day on Tuesday and Wednesday.
3749417	3753119	So like, no, I think on Tuesday we're played like in the morning.
3753479	3754679	So that might be a different time.
3754839	3760561	So those that want the live experience to kind of listen to this as it goes on can listen at those times too.
3760621	3762422	And that can help adjust for time zones.
3762582	3763602	So something to think about.
3765263	3765463	Okay.
3766423	3766683	All right.
3767446	3767826	Beat Takashi!
3767987	3768587	Beat Takashi!
3795049	3796010	TAKASHI'S CHALLENGE
3814310	3827437	Takashi's Challenge puts the players through hell, like forcing the player to sing karaoke continuously, stare at a blank monitor, pilot a plane that can't go up, and then hit the final boss 20,000 times.
3827998	3831219	Was this a for-real video game that was released, or is this some weirdo?
3831239	3833600	Apparently, Taito released it back in 1986.
3833680	3833941	Okay.
3834041	3838783	Dot, dot, dot.
3838843	3841945	Taito is the same cracked-out company that gave us...
3843485	3844325	and Bubble Bobble.
3866573	3867614	Yeah, what's up, liar?
3867754	3868694	It got pushed back.
3869455	3870555	Loki, liar of the week.
3870815	3872536	No, EA's the liar of the week.
3872556	3873477	EA's pushed it back.
3873537	3875658	It's supposed to come out on the 28th.
3877299	3878399	Or 29th, I'm sorry.
3878980	3880841	Between the 28th and 29th, they say.
3882321	3883742	Sometime Tuesday and Wednesday.
3884342	3887444	Maybe about 8 o'clock Tuesday night is in between there.
3887584	3893327	Hey, listen, you got Burnout and freaking Blazing Angels, so play those while you're waiting.
3893347	3893927	Yes, sir.
3896485	3897706	Well, I have something.
3897866	3898106	Okay.
3898667	3900568	This is from Old Grandma Hardcore.
3901549	3903511	Oh, yes, her, the granny gamer.
3903851	3904512	The granny gamer.
3904532	3904892	Love her.
3905773	3920665	Basically, there is a chronicle out on YouTube now, and the link is up at oldgrannyhardcore.blogspot.com, about how she has laid down some massive, massive ownage at brain training.
3921986	3922727	Right on.
3922747	3923607	And apparently...
3927404	3931045	There was actually a few of the other people who were playing who actually said that drinking helped their scores improve.
3932005	3939107	But Granny had finished her game while the little girl was still going past the time limit.
3939787	3940027	Wow.
3940587	3942448	So yeah, and there's a movie file up here.
3942488	3943748	So I'm going to share that with our chat room.
3944088	3952611	But if you go to oghc.blogspot.com, the link is up there for the week of March 20th.
3953391	3953771	Very cool.
3954775	3958478	Alright, I got one last story for you guys here tonight.
3959159	3966406	And it has to do with, I'm sure, a TV show that our folks that listen to us live don't watch because it's on the same time as our program.
3966906	3968508	But it does have to do with gaming, believe it or not.
3969148	3980098	Walt Disney's Buena Vista Games said this week that it is going to be releasing a PC video game based on the television show Desperate Housewives this fall.
3980138	3980439	What? !
3981259	3982159	Desperate Housewives
4010854	4025309	Here's your chance Something tells me those guys that emailed us saying they like to play as the girls Something tells me they'll take a pass on this one Call it a hunch Loki, don't you watch Desperate Housewives?
4025509	4026831	No, I don't Oh, I thought you did
4027156	4029318	No, Nelly watches Desperate Housewives.
4030639	4032921	I do not watch Desperate Housewives.
4033722	4038927	I may have been forced to watch the first season of Desperate Housewives, but that's where it stops.
4039187	4039747	We can't.
4040008	4044492	Our show's on at the same time here on the West Coast, so we can't watch it, even if we wanted to, which I don't.
4044932	4045653	You can watch it.
4046814	4047354	You can watch it.
4047374	4048175	We have not TiVo.
4049696	4050097	You know what?
4050337	4051578	I don't feel like taking the effort.
4052399	4053640	That's just how it stands.
4053902	4055783	The only way I'd play this game is if I can kill them.
4058965	4062086	And by kill them, I mean brutally kill them.
4062486	4065268	23rd Magus says no hot coffee equals instaloos.
4065648	4067649	So maybe we need to have hot coffee in this.
4067829	4072511	So, you know, those of you guys out there that have always wanted to... What's her name?
4073452	4076273	Gabriela... What the hell's her name?
4076373	4077194	Gabriela Carteris?
4077254	4077834	No, no.
4077914	4078754	That was the chick in 90210.
4078875	4079155	I know!
4079195	4079775	Same show.
4084369	4086290	What the hell's... Oh, Eva Longoria.
4086891	4087871	She plays somebody, I think.
4088672	4089992	She plays Gabrielle on the show.
4090032	4090833	How the hell do I know that?
4090873	4091934	Okay, Eva Longoria.
4092954	4093094	Right?
4093134	4094595	She's the hot one on the show.
4094755	4097317	You know, I'm sure a lot of guys want to, you know... I guess.
4097637	4098177	I don't know.
4099038	4099338	You know what?
4099378	4099698	Forget it.
4100218	4101639	Let's just end the show.
4101879	4102800	Let's quit while we're ahead.
4103921	4106142	And we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.
4106202	4107263	Loki, your final thought.
4107383	4112566	My final thought is I just read another story that's yet pointing to Nintendo doing VR.
4112826	4112986	But,
4114843	4115943	This is rumor stories.
4116003	4117104	I hate rumor stories.
4117484	4118464	Six weeks, Loki.
4118784	4119264	You can wait.
4119765	4120485	No, I can't.
4120785	4121805	Ekstafer, your final thought.
4124426	4128667	To all the girl-babe gamers out there, preach on, brothers.
4128767	4129367	I mean, sistas.
4131508	4133108	DarkSakura, your final thought.
4133748	4139830	I'm going to pass on the reject false icons this week in order to describe a beverage called the Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster.
4140710	4142511	Those of us who read Hitchhiker's Guide know what this is.
4143655	4150017	It says the effect of a pan-galactic gargle blaster is like having your brain smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped around a large gold brick.
4151497	4152617	I need one of those right now.
4154298	4161660	My final thought would be I really suck at Geometry Wars and I'm never going to get better and that makes me a sad gamer.
