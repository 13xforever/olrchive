14104	25243	Tonight, March 19th, 2006, a barrage of updates on the PlayStation 3, we dispel April Fool's rumors already hitting the internet, and do we really have to say goodbye to Katamari Damacy?
32765	35887	Welcome everybody to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35967	38949	We're here to give you the news that gamers really want to know about.
39770	41491	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.
41551	45594	Joining me as always, say hello to my awesome co-host, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
45874	45974	Yo.
46054	46834	How you doing?
47455	47735	Full.
48175	48495	Full?
48536	49556	You just ate before the show?
49936	52238	Yeah, I had my usual burrito.
52798	53058	Awesome.
53119	53719	Of doom.
54559	55880	What makes it a burrito of doom?
56701	58522	Is it blessed by the Dark Lord Satan or what?
59082	59843	I'm just kidding, I don't know.
60425	63267	No, no, Satan decided not to bless my burrito.
63447	64068	I see, alright.
65929	67790	Also say hello to our tech master, Loki.
68190	68471	Hello.
68491	69151	How you doing?
69872	70392	I'm good.
70432	71953	I feel like a Got Milk commercial.
71973	75576	I have all that chocolate from those brownie bites.
75836	76136	I know.
77317	80139	That's like two weeks in a row that we've had those brownie bites here.
80159	83121	Well, I went to Starbucks to go buy them, but they only had two.
85009	92312	They were also out of white mocha, which I don't really care because I don't drink coffee, but Nellie wanted a white mocha, so.
92832	94253	So you had to hear all that complaining?
95273	95694	Uh, no.
96234	97394	And then, I don't know.
97895	98675	I don't like Starbucks.
100135	100496	Oh, what's that?
100636	101116	Oh, yay, brownie.
101816	104337	Anyway, we're here on this episode number 177 for this.
106331	124038	March 19th of 2006 and we got a lot of news to go into tonight so let's just start getting into the show we always started off talking about how our gaming week was the kinds of games we played this week little mini reviews on stuff we've looked into and just so you know that we're gamers too you know DarkSakura what you been doing this week
126364	129907	Actually, a lot of Animal Crossing again, just because it's what I can play at work.
130547	133249	The rest of my time has been spent doing school stuff.
133709	144197	However, my husband has told me that I'm getting a PSP of my very own soon because of a certain case that will be associated with a certain game.
145758	146319	What's this?
147039	152283	For me and my Katamari, apparently there's a case being released that's in the shape of the prince's head.
153106	155107	Oh, I think I saw a picture of that somewhere.
155507	158768	I don't know if it was a custom thing or the official one, but I know I've seen a picture of a PSP.
158828	162089	Well, it's got to be official if it's being shipped to GameStop.
162189	168111	Well, I know, but I'm wondering if the picture I saw was the official one or a fan one, because you know fans probably did one, too, before that.
168670	171231	Animal Crossing I noticed a lot of people...
197307	197787	and so on and so forth.
215040	217041	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
244247	250051	Actually, I think it's slightly harder, but then again, I've been playing it on the micro, where it's like really, really tiny.
251091	255614	See, that's why I won't get a micro, because my eyesight's borderline bad enough.
256655	257335	Mine was a gift.
259622	260262	Puzzle games.
260302	263683	You know what puzzle game never really came out for a home console that kind of made me sad?
263983	267344	They used to have this game at Golfland Local Arcade, the Battle Balls.
267625	271206	Did you ever play that with the marbles that you had to stack like four in a row?
271266	272026	I never played that.
272146	272886	Oh, it was kind of fun.
273086	274167	It was an import game.
274227	275567	Isn't that a Capcom game?
276247	276507	Is it?
277047	278128	I don't know.
278208	280789	What about, oh shoot, what was that one?
281109	281689	Magical Drop.
282799	285360	Magical Drop kind of had like a resurgence.
285380	286341	You can get that on your phone.
286381	287861	I had Magical Drop on my cell phone.
287901	288382	Go figure.
288582	289002	Crazy.
289542	292303	I've got Magical Drop on an EOGO CD.
292684	295685	Well, I mean, that's the way to do it if you want to do it authentic.
295725	298086	But I'm pretty sure Magical Drop also existed.
298926	302388	I want to say there was a version of it on Super Nintendo, but please don't quote me on that.
302468	304069	I thought that they did one actually for the Pocket.
305109	306230	Oh, probably.
306530	307730	Probably because it was an SNK game.
308571	308751	Yeah.
309073	309974	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
332903	335806	Oh wait, that's totally not true.
335846	337868	They don't send me gifts, but I got one in person.
337908	341611	I got a pretty big one in person not that long ago, so I can't say that.
341831	342152	My bad.
342592	344313	I also found a very interesting book.
345194	353642	I was at Barnes & Noble last night, and there was a retro magazine that they did with the Super R-Type on the cover.
353662	354562	I was like, yeah!
354622	356164	They have a gaming retro magazine?
356544	356804	Yeah.
356904	357565	That's kind of rad.
357745	358286	I didn't know that.
358900	365562	There's also another book that was something about writing and poetry spawned from old video games.
366482	369744	It was one of the end cap books in the fantasy section that made me laugh.
369824	370344	Haikus?
371944	373025	I don't think it was a haiku book.
373045	375986	You know what we should have on OrangeSongsRadio.com is a haiku forum.
378686	380027	Oh, great video game.
380587	382648	How I love thee so much.
383288	384568	I play you all day.
384588	386089	It's beautiful.
386309	386769	I was moved.
387597	390580	It actually was right too.
390680	393522	I saw your fingers tapping as you were talking.
394303	395504	Anything else you want to share about your week?
396365	397186	Ouch.
397466	398607	Loki, how was your gaming week?
399708	400609	My week was okay.
401289	404692	I've been playing a lot of the Xbox stuff.
404892	409016	I bought The Outfit and I played that for about half an hour.
409356	410077	So that's kind of cool.
410257	411938	I haven't really gotten in the back.
412099	413520	I've been trying to finish up
414212	440793	getting the rest of my achievements in full auto and I have one left and that's rank 10 online I just got my million or was it a million like was it a million points in just the game and then 100 no 1000 kills I got the achievement for that and I have rank 9 I just did and then I just have rank 10 online to do and then I'm done with the game
441084	442505	What are achievement points to you?
442545	446128	Are you an achievement point whore where you have to have as many as you possibly can?
446909	447490	Yes and no.
448270	449291	I'm kind of that way too.
449912	455036	It's like, I just want to get done with the game because I'm not really playing it too much anymore and it's just...
455583	458127	It's okay multiplayer, but it's not that fun.
458427	459849	So I just want to get done with it.
459929	466518	So if I feel like selling it, I know that I've milked all the achievement points out of it that I could possibly get.
467319	469482	I'm kind of yes and no on the achievement points.
469683	471645	If I see, for instance, take...
473291	474432	Take Geometry Wars.
474512	482257	Geometry Wars has an achievement point that you get like 5 or 10 points, I don't remember, for what's called pacifism, where you don't get hit by anything for 60 seconds.
482558	482938	Exactly.
482978	489142	I was kind of like, okay, normally I wouldn't play the game like that, but okay, if I get 10 points out of it, I'll try it out.
489162	490303	And it actually is kind of tough.
490363	491584	I didn't get it my first try.
492004	493325	It was actually a bit of a challenge.
493345	495567	But, you know, I'll go out of my way for little things like that.
496007	501131	But I know people that, like, there was an article on the internet, I don't remember if it was this week or last week, um,
501691	504572	It was about how to get easily 6,000 gamer points.
504592	505992	Yeah, it's all sports games.
506313	508413	And I'm kind of like, okay, no, that's not cool.
511334	517636	If that's the way you're getting the gamers points, then that means nothing when you look at the score.
517816	523798	I mean, it's unfortunate that the score doesn't really tell you right away how the points were gotten, but I still really like the system.
523838	525458	I think it's really kind of innovative.
525918	527319	It's certainly different, but...
528693	531077	I did play a little bit of Geometry Wars.
531117	536987	I did get the Pacifist achievement, which was a pain in the ass.
537828	540052	I've only been able to get about 100,000, and then I get
542564	544105	I really suck at Geometry Wars.
544225	546685	There's too much flashy shit on the screen.
546966	550647	I've been wondering if I should try it in retro mode, if that would make a difference.
551247	552107	Your score won't rank.
552927	553868	It's just a different mode.
554748	558589	There is a ranking mode for it, but it's not the same one that the achievements unlock on.
560052	561954	It's just too flashy.
561974	564776	There's too many particles in there and stuff.
565297	567259	I was actually reading an FAQ on the game.
567339	568240	I was looking on forums.
568640	572003	I think I might have actually been on the official Xbox forums looking for hints on how to play.
572324	575947	And people are saying like, oh, you should be able to breeze through the first 500k easily.
575987	579591	I'm like, okay, am I just old and my hand-eye coordination has gone way down or what?
579871	582093	Because I really have a hard time breaking...
582694	609681	like 200k on a regular basis maybe I'm just like I read a tip that I thought was interesting in the tip suggested that like if you're having a hard time with it you focus on your ship and nothing but the ship like you don't allow anything else on the screen to distract you except your ship so that way you're dodging no matter what and that will help you get through like at least like if they say the first 500k or million or something like that but then after that you really do have to use your peripheral vision because I guess things just start bombarding you like crazy but
610117	612878	That'll at least help you if you're struggling in the beginning like I am.
613638	614058	Like you are.
614538	614858	I don't know.
615359	616859	Then I was playing Feeding Frenzy.
617119	628462	The thing I like about this and the fact the way the achievements are is it's a game where, say I beat 10 levels of it, I can start it back later and play starting from level 10 and keep going on.
628722	631023	It makes achievements really simple on it.
631043	633624	Plus, it's a pretty simple game, actually.
634844	637445	That's the one where you start off as a small fish and
639514	651911	I've played a game exactly like that at Dave and Buster's except it gave you tickets and I have to say tickets are a little cooler than the achievement points because tickets I can trade in for stuffed animals which is cool.
652816	660818	I'm just waiting for when they come up with something on Xbox Live that you can only access it if you have X amount of achievement points or something like that.
660979	662499	I think that would be kind of neat.
662619	671602	It doesn't necessarily have to be a game, but something like a beta only open to hardcore players who got a certain amount of achievement points on something.
672302	674403	Or maybe one of these deals.
674463	675263	But the problem is...
675763	682226	is that it's these articles like the How to Get 6,000 Gamers Points Easily that are going to kind of screw that up.
682326	685467	And unfortunately, some games, the achievement points are way easier to get than others.
685767	689689	For instance, going with Xbox Live Arcade, Crystal Quest compared to Bejeweled.
690399	697902	Okay, Bejeweled, you have to play hardcore because all the achievements practically are like astronomical numbers of rounds and points.
698182	705785	Whereas Crystal Quest, if you get pretty good at it, you'll only have to play through one or two times to really unlock the bulk of achievement points.
706065	708106	I mean, some of the time, you know, you have to spend time with it for the others.
708566	713628	But, I mean, put the two games side by side and, you know, it's much easier to get it in the one.
715216	715496	I don't know.
715996	725678	But other than that, I've been playing a little bit of Burnout, a little bit of Full Auto, of course, The Outfit, as I mentioned, and I think that's pretty much it.
725698	734460	I've just been kind of bouncing around from those, and a little bit of Grand Theft Auto, Liberty City Stories, of course, and God, I think there was another game in there, too.
734900	737781	Oh, I actually played The Simpsons on my main cabinet for a little bit.
739281	739781	Yeah, that's about it.
740521	740961	Alright, awesome.
741921	742542	Yes, DarkSakura?
744342	744582	Nothing.
745069	746912	Oh, I thought you had a thought, because you reached for your mic suddenly.
746952	748956	I thought it was going to fall.
749176	753083	You know what it might be, is that you're getting ready to scold me for my gaming week.
753403	754565	Oh no, what'd you do?
755186	758612	I spent the majority of my gaming week playing Final Fantasy XI.
760578	762860	Addict, that's okay, I went back to Ragnarok online.
763060	764642	Addict, alright, so we're even.
765783	770687	Yeah, so I've been playing Fallout SE 11 starting over from scratch, and I think I mentioned on the last podcast I was going to do this.
770967	773649	Well, I've actually been in the habit of doing it this week and playing.
773669	781516	I'm already up to level 9, yes, and soon I'll be level 30 and be all ready for the expansion pack when it comes out, because the expansion pack
782165	783626	Definitely looks like it's going to be worth a try.
783886	788048	They're incorporating elements of older Final Fantasies and stuff into it, which is kind of neat.
788089	792991	Somebody pointed out to me in the trailer, you can see one of the judges from Final Fantasy Tactics and stuff in it.
793512	796273	I think that's kind of neat.
796473	797334	We'll see what happens with that.
797354	799115	I am interested in some of the new classes.
799395	802817	I'm prepping my little Taru, because I reincarnated myself as a Taru.
802917	804978	I said I'm doing an absolute clean start.
805419	808060	New server, so I can't get any of the same help I had before.
808180	809361	New character, new everything.
809641	811302	So I reincarnated myself as a little Taru Taru.
811662	813223	So I plan on being a blue mage.
813463	816384	But the problem is that everybody's going to be a blue mage when that thing rolls out.
816524	817385	I remember Lil' Kim.
818185	822047	Lil' Kim was my mule on my old server, and she was a Taru as well.
822587	825468	So I'll tell you the name of my new character off-air.
825548	827949	But I will say I play on the Seraph server now.
828109	830450	So I'm watching you guys, the Seraph server.
830710	832631	I'll talk smack about you on the show if you wrong me.
833352	835072	I'll tell you my character name off-air because it's really cool.
835853	836393	I just don't want to get...
837086	841589	You actually reminded me that I did forget to say that I'm on a free server for Ragnarok.
842229	844050	Whatever happened with the legality of that?
844130	844931	Isn't that kind of a gray area?
844971	846412	I don't think Gravity cares anymore.
846632	846892	Really?
847452	849334	As long as they're making money, huh?
849774	851895	The server that I'm playing on is super dedicated.
852435	856598	I mean, it's so much better than playing on IRO.
857358	858579	I've never had any problem.
859560	860480	It's been really great.
861421	861521	Okay.
863295	867178	As far as the rest of my gaming week, I also was playing quite a bit of Xbox Live Arcade.
867278	868499	I checked out Jewel Quest.
868539	874483	I actually bought Jewel Quest because I knew it was kind of like Bejeweled, and I like Bejeweled, so I bought it.
875043	878645	My problem with Jewel Quest is that it's too much like Bejeweled.
879546	879846	I don't know.
879886	880627	For some reason, I just...
881147	882328	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
904945	909526	The achievement points are certainly easier, but honestly, I'm not really considering that in my review of the game.
910106	911226	I put the game side by side.
911307	913107	I definitely prefer Bejeweled.
913167	915007	I think it's got some more modes.
915027	916488	I think it's just more polished looking.
916568	919668	When you consider that they're essentially the same game, I mean, not really.
920048	928210	Jewel Quest is about not how many three in a row you connect, but where you get them on the board, and it kind of influences your strategy a little bit, but really...
928885	929145	I want Tetris.
929165	931666	They have Tetris Grandmaster that came out for the Japanese launch.
954403	955244	I don't think this is true.
976696	987713	maybe they own the exclusive rights for their own systems or something because you notice all the Tetris games that come out on Nintendo systems are Nintendo games like this new DS one that's coming out is a Nintendo game the old Game Boy one I don't know I don't know
988459	990260	Maybe somebody in the chat room knows.
990300	990600	I don't know.
990840	992040	That's OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
992080	994981	Click on chat if you want to share some information with us.
995021	996682	Or, of course, you can always drop us an email as well.
997062	998863	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
999463	1001424	Let's get into some gaming news for tonight.
1001544	1002304	Let's start it off.
1002964	1005545	I think a lot of us might have something to contribute here with the PlayStation 3.
1006086	1008447	Obviously, they had that huge press conference earlier this week.
1008887	1013689	Probably most of you guys on the internet have read it by now, but we have to talk about it anyway.
1013769	1014909	Certainly, we want to give our input.
1015209	1016609	Loki, start us off with a summary.
1016649	1018650	What did we find out about after this conference this week?
1018710	1022171	Well, they announced a few things about both the PlayStation 3 and PSP.
1022731	1024552	We'll start off with the PlayStation 3.
1025212	1026792	Of course, it's going to be launched in November.
1027252	1033314	You know, I think that was only news to Sony because everyone else figured that it was going to be November.
1033614	1039676	Well, it's nice to hear them actually confirm it because I think most of us were thinking it was going to be 2007 at this point.
1039796	1044257	Well, I'm not confirming it and saying that they're actually going to make it in November because, I mean...
1045306	1053510	After all, Microsoft did say they were going to ship 3 million units by the three-month mark, and that never happened.
1054651	1057212	I credit Sony with a little bit more brains than Microsoft.
1058333	1058893	Well, we'll see.
1059393	1060494	I don't know about that.
1061094	1068538	You know what's interesting is that I was reading a separate article this week that talked about the launch of the Sega Saturn, and when they launched that, it was like a surprise announcement at E3.
1068578	1071439	It was one of those things that was like, we're not telling you to wait until November.
1071599	1072620	It's on shelves today.
1073396	1080372	And I think that's kind of cool, but at the same time it also kind of killed the system because with the surprise announcement there wasn't enough time for all the developers to get the games out, so...
1080973	1082513	I mean, it's kind of a double-edged sword there.
1082553	1083034	No, no, no, no, no.
1083234	1087915	What killed the system, what killed the Saturn was Sega's whole marketing ploy.
1088735	1094217	The Saturn did very well in Japan, and it had much better games that we never saw, that never saw the light of day in the U.S.
1094237	1094717	True.
1095097	1096297	It was very import-friendly.
1096817	1097498	True, true.
1097778	1098918	So that's what killed the Saturn.
1099018	1100879	Anyway, sorry, this isn't about Sega, it's about Sony.
1100939	1101699	Anyway, moving on.
1102239	1107840	Anyways, it's going to be released somewhere in the first 10, 11 days of November.
1108101	1109581	You know, so the early part of November there.
1110174	1115637	and it's going to be including a 60 gigabyte hard drive pre-installed with Linux.
1117338	1117919	So, ha!
1118219	1124423	They beat the... I think that's kind of funny is that they've kind of just given in to the fact that somebody's going to install Linux on this anyway, so here you go.
1124443	1125163	It's going to be us.
1126824	1128485	Anyways, so I thought that was funny.
1129005	1131227	They're going to have, what was it...
1132574	1134175	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1159671	1160552	Honestly, come on.
1160712	1162032	Sony's got to know better than that.
1162052	1163133	They know that would be suicide.
1163153	1164373	Well, you have to understand this.
1164393	1170116	It might be $900 if you bought the system for what it's actually worth, but you know everyone sells systems at a loss.
1170376	1172537	Sony's going to have to be prepared to take a hell of a loss on these.
1172557	1173437	It's going to be interesting.
1173457	1174918	Got to lose money to make money.
1175258	1181201	Yeah, I mean, the whole thing was with the Blu-ray drive, and that's what half the cost is.
1181441	1183222	Oh, well.
1185063	1190565	is going to be fully backwards compatible with all PlayStation and PlayStation 2 titles.
1190906	1195387	And they're going to basically upscale all of them like the 360 does with the games.
1195467	1197728	That was one of the most exciting announcements to me, honestly.
1199109	1205312	Also, they're going to be digitally distributing PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 games to the console.
1206637	1207377	PlayStation Hub Service
1233223	1249833	which is going to be for both the PlayStation Portable and the PS3 as well as they're going to be what's kind of neat about that is it will be free to play multiplayer games but there's going to be additional content on there that will cost money and they'll have subscription services for that type of stuff.
1251073	1256416	The servers will not be a central server like Microsoft.
1256677	1260659	They will be separate, each run by different companies but
1261331	1263713	Spirit Snare says, I think they're probably aiming for 550-ish.
1280929	1281950	5.50 is a little more reasonable.
1282411	1288737	Honestly, if I were to make a prediction, to compete with Microsoft, they've got to do one of two things.
1289117	1292701	They really have to release this system for $399, just like the Xbox.
1292721	1293462	It's not going to be less than $400.
1294122	1296505	Yeah, but they're flat out saying it's not going to be less than $400.
1297285	1304048	So I'm thinking that they're going to have to release, I think the price point will be $4.99 is my guess, and of course I don't know shit, but $4.99 is my guess.
1304428	1311552	But they're really going to emphasize Blu-ray, this will play movies in high def, and they're going to say you need this.
1311612	1315093	And they're going to really emphasize those things that that system can do that Xbox 360 doesn't do.
1315113	1316034	What they need to do.
1316334	1332417	I think you're going to see them throw in a bonus movie like you remember when PSP came out they gave Spider-Man 2 free I bet you anything there's going to be a tie-in where the first few PlayStation Soul will come with a free Blu-ray movie whatever Sony's big summer picture is will be the tie-in movie
1332537	1335058	What they need to do is they need to have this system.
1335098	1341021	They need to emphasize the fact that you don't have to go out and buy all these additional peripherals and crap that you had to do with the 360.
1341802	1342622	Oh, I got a system.
1342882	1344203	Oh, wait, now I got controllers.
1344383	1346324	Oh, each one of those are $40 each.
1346484	1348265	Oh, I have to buy the right cables for my TV.
1348545	1350386	By the way, those are also $40 each.
1351266	1353087	Oh, I didn't get a remote with mine.
1353207	1353627	Oh, guess what?
1353647	1354828	That's $40 also.
1354988	1356769	Yeah, it all adds up in the end.
1357321	1359763	And by the way, those controllers, how much did it cost Microsoft to make them?
1359823	1361325	Oh yeah, it was like $10 or something.
1361685	1362546	Interesting way to look at it.
1363426	1364948	They're making their money back in peripherals.
1365348	1366169	That's where the money is.
1366449	1367830	Isn't Spider-Man 3 this summer?
1368451	1369652	No, Spider-Man 3 is next summer.
1369972	1374836	Dirty Thief just made a good point to give Advent Children as the free movie.
1375777	1378079	But would they be able to do that when it's really Square's movie?
1378279	1380141	I mean, certainly a lot of fanboys would love to see that.
1380161	1381022	Square's in Sony's bed.
1381642	1382263	I guess that's true.
1383370	1383790	You never know.
1383870	1384871	Blu-ray version of it, though.
1385631	1386051	I'll be hot.
1386451	1386931	That would be.
1387571	1388492	Anyways.
1388552	1389732	Certainly make it more attractive.
1390412	1397014	Now, the other things, of course, they were talking about was the PSP and some of the stuff that's not much of a surprise.
1397074	1400535	We knew that there was going to be an iToy peripheral coming, a webcam type thing.
1401395	1406877	That's going to be coming, I believe, it was September was the announced date for that.
1407338	1413640	and then, of course, GPS is coming on later in the year, probably in the third or fourth quarter.
1414500	1421642	Then, of course, with the iToy type of peripheral on there, they're going to be adding video phone support in the fall.
1422402	1430044	One of the other things that was kind of interesting, they did announce that there was going to be a core pack that's going to be a reduced price PSP.
1430084	1432545	Basically, you're just getting the bare-bones stuff.
1432565	1433445	You're not getting a case.
1434113	1440156	No headphones, which to be honest, the case and headphones kind of sucked anyways, so save $50.
1441097	1447860	And they're going to be releasing a ceramic white PSP core pack as well, which is going to be pretty cool.
1448821	1450602	I think that's Japan only though for the white one.
1451582	1457686	What is interesting though is they're going to be offering an official PlayStation 1 emulator for the PSP.
1458706	1480303	and you'll be able to digitally download these straight off the internet to your PSP and I think this is where the 4GB NAND Flash PSP comes into play where you'll be able to store these on your memory stick and I don't understand how these aren't going to be pirated from memory sticks but I don't know they're going to find a way I'm sure interesting
1481491	1489100	and of course with the next update the web browser will get full Flash 6.0 support.
1489300	1491743	So it will be able to view most web pages.
1491763	1493385	We'll have to put some on our PSP site.
1493886	1494527	True, true.
1494747	1499573	And also they're going to be able to record streaming audio.
1500905	1501985	Oh, that's cool.
1502045	1516808	You know what's interesting about the PSP to me is that they're really trying to think of things that the DS hasn't done yet to really sell the system more as not a game system but as a personal entertainment system.
1516868	1517488	Let's put it that way.
1517808	1524849	Like with the whole iToy support, being able to do the short videos and these exchanges over the internet and stuff with the old games.
1525169	1530070	I think they're really trying to think of the things, and the web support too, like things that the DS...
1530630	1531491	Really hasn't done yet.
1531531	1534652	Whereas most of the DS's innovations have been about the games itself.
1534992	1536133	Which, don't get me wrong, have been great.
1536433	1541776	But I think PSP, you really see it trying to solidify itself as the more entertainment system as opposed to the game system.
1541796	1546618	Well, what's interesting with the GPS thing is it is going to be available.
1546838	1550980	One of the first games it's going to use is a new Hot Shots game coming out, which I thought was interesting.
1551820	1555322	But apparently there's current games in the library right now that support it.
1555982	1559044	But just hasn't been unlocked yet or whatever.
1559680	1561981	GS191 has a good comment in chat room.
1562101	1564202	Oh great, fucking Flash ads on my PSP.
1566843	1568504	Hey, I'm going to tell you this much though.
1568724	1579629	What I've been waiting for is Flash for the website because you can do a live 365 player in Flash and that's good because you can listen to our show on the go.
1580229	1580749	That would be good.
1583430	1587052	Whatever happened to the days when video game systems played video games?
1588151	1593576	well the PSP does play games and they've certainly got a lot of good games coming out this first quarter this year but
1595069	1595409	I don't know.
1595429	1597631	I think we're seeing this trend with all the next-gen systems.
1597691	1598832	It's sad.
1599692	1600333	Sadness.
1600593	1602354	They don't want to be just the game system.
1602374	1604476	They want to be that centerpiece in your living room.
1604516	1606617	And I think that's what we've heard in a lot of press conferences, too.
1607037	1609759	They want to be the place where you can download movies.
1610099	1613141	Look at Xbox 360, just released this week on Xbox Live.
1613442	1615343	You can download a music video now for free.
1615683	1617805	So it's kind of like, you know, they're really...
1619006	1621648	I don't think it's all necessarily about the games anymore.
1621688	1624330	That is why I love my DS.
1624390	1629754	The only thing that PSP has ever been useful to me for is actually just watching movies on the airplane.
1630314	1631475	Because I've watched Hellboy.
1631615	1632676	But Luminous is cool.
1633176	1634037	Luminous is good.
1634657	1639861	I haven't really played much else on the PSP that I really like other than that and Popolo Cross.
1641323	1646947	If I want to play a game, I'm going to play a system dedicated to the game.
1647941	1649983	by a company dedicated to gameplay.
1650963	1653525	I don't care what it looks like, as long as it's fun.
1654686	1658168	You know... It's sad.
1658348	1659569	It's very... It's sad.
1660210	1662772	So you think people's focus aren't on the games themselves anymore?
1662792	1663792	I remember the Odyssey 2.
1664953	1665253	Right.
1666454	1668416	That crap came out when I was two years old.
1668476	1668696	Right.
1669236	1673259	I remember watching the little blips on the screen and thinking that it was so much fun.
1674060	1674180	And...
1675407	1680070	Just seeing the way that games are going now, the systems especially, just sort of is heartbreaking.
1681672	1682332	It's very sad.
1682992	1685114	Very sad that people can't be satisfied with good gameplay.
1685935	1686875	We'll see, we'll see.
1687516	1689297	Alright, moving on.
1689337	1691198	Anything else you want to share on the Sony there, Loki?
1693480	1694201	I was just trying to think.
1695021	1702346	Some of the interesting thoughts about it, they did mention, I think it was the PSP webcam or their iToy, I guess they're calling it.
1703567	1704268	It's going to be
1705963	1708104	They were calling it like PSP 290 or something.
1708124	1713526	And I figured, okay, well, firmware 2.9 then is going to support this or something like that.
1714006	1721309	It was just kind of the, I guess their item code or whatever for it kind of tied in with the firmware that will support it.
1723390	1724130	I think it's a good thing.
1724490	1727951	I'm glad to see some cool peripherals and stuff come out.
1729052	1733393	I was hoping that that webcam or eye toy can be used as a digital camera.
1733533	1734734	I hope it's good enough for that.
1735766	1740009	The only thing I don't understand is how the fuck are you going to use it as an eye toy?
1740289	1742251	Seriously, are you going to be flailing around?
1743111	1744212	It's not going to work like that.
1745633	1745913	I don't know.
1745933	1748075	I think it's more like what you're saying there.
1748095	1751357	I think it's going to be more for chatting and for picture taking.
1752578	1752938	Why not?
1753198	1757141	If the PSP is going to be a little entertainment in a box, why not be a digital camera as well?
1757261	1758282	People like digital cameras.
1759683	1762645	People like cell phones that play music and have iTunes on them.
1763442	1764422	Fucking dumbasses.
1765362	1767903	Alright, let's go on to some other news this week.
1768483	1772064	Let's get into some news about a very popular PlayStation game.
1772424	1774164	This one being on the PS2, right Loki?
1774524	1775824	Final Fantasy XII.
1776845	1779125	God damn, we've been waiting for that for a long time.
1779645	1781825	Of course, if you're in Japan, you're already playing it.
1782346	1782986	And it's awesome.
1784246	1788327	But, if you're looking for it in the US, you're going to have to wait until Thanksgiving.
1788347	1790067	Because that's when it's coming out.
1791621	1794144	I've heard fantastic reviews on this game.
1794164	1801191	Of course, we mentioned Famitsu Magazine last week, but I'm very excited about Final Fantasy XII and I wish it wouldn't take him so damn long to release it here.
1801531	1803293	I'm still laughing about the potion commercial.
1803914	1804875	I haven't seen that yet.
1805035	1812303	I know somebody posted... Well, I have a friend who lives in Japan right now who said, I guess she thinks it's tasty.
1814248	1815548	I'm looking forward to the game.
1815608	1816809	I love the battle system.
1816929	1825231	I know a lot of people have acted really weird about it, but being the addict I am with Final Fantasy XI, I think it's a great combination of XI and the old school Final Fantasies.
1825271	1826271	I'm looking forward to trying it out.
1826331	1829012	If it plays anything like XI, I'll guarantee I won't play it.
1829212	1830392	It doesn't play like XI.
1830692	1831352	Thank God.
1831432	1833893	Because you don't have to spend an hour looking for a party.
1834553	1835094	It's already there.
1835134	1835814	It's part of the story.
1835855	1839918	To be honest... No, I don't like the gameplay in XI, which is part of why I quit.
1840118	1849946	To be honest, it reminds me of a cross between Final Fantasy X2 or X and... X. Final Fantasy X and X2 and...
1852822	1854243	I just like doing that.
1854684	1855384	And Parasite Eve.
1855685	1861171	I mean, Parasite Eve, it reminds me of the battle system, the way they did that, where you've got this sphere where you can attack.
1861591	1867597	Basically, it's just, you can run around and do shit, but it's still like kind of an active time battle system.
1867738	1868839	Yeah, kind of.
1870179	1870919	Final Fantasy XII Business Week
1885948	1890111	The quote was, There are rumors that the revolution could be released as early as June.
1890572	1895817	If that happens, and Nintendo sells around 1 million units, Sony could have a harder time catching up.
1896417	1902383	And that quote comes from Akitiro Itoa from Japan's game tracking service, Media Create.
1903424	1908249	Now, of course, when you look at the reality of it, the chances of the console actually coming out in June...
1908749	1910290	Probably not going to happen.
1910530	1913492	And the reason why is because the development hardware is not out there right now.
1913552	1916994	So if that's not out, it's going to be very hard for the games to be out by June.
1917074	1920757	So probably November is a more realistic time frame.
1921197	1925220	And Nintendo has also been kind of quoted recently saying Thanksgiving week of 2006.
1925400	1930343	So I don't think there really is going to be any June surprise in store.
1930443	1934566	So nothing like that whole Sega thing we were talking about earlier where they surprise us at E3.
1935106	1935646	Not likely.
1936067	1936487	Sorry to say.
1938053	1940475	Moving on, somebody that works for Nintendo, Miyamoto.
1940755	1945580	Yes, Miyamoto reacted to the PlayStation 3 announcement this week.
1947062	1949044	Not too surprising the way he reacted.
1949084	1959675	It was basically, you know, kind of put a quote out there that's saying, you know, people are kind of getting tired of the same old video games nowadays, and what
1960439	1989994	these you know like Microsoft and Sony are doing for video games as far as they're improving the graphics but they're not really changing the gameplay any and so he's not too worried just because they've never really seen the other companies as competition because they're kind of in their own boat basically as being innovative whereas you know these guys are just pushing graphics and stuff you're not really pushing better gameplay I'm not surprised to hear that coming from Miyamoto not at all it's just you know
1991400	1992541	I have to agree.
1993562	1995202	Games aren't really that much better.
1995483	1997103	That's kind of what Jamie was saying just a little bit ago.
1997123	1998304	They look prettier, but they're not different.
1998344	2006228	In a personal stance, just looking at sales of different games out there, when I'm selling to customers and stuff,
2006926	2007146	and so on.
2027939	2035406	I have to ask Jamie, having said that a little bit ago about the, you know, it's sad that the systems are kind of leaning towards being all-in-one.
2035706	2039970	Does this strike you as Nintendo being committed to the games?
2041291	2041552	Yeah.
2042613	2045776	I mean, that's always what they've been about, you know?
2046236	2049259	Why would they ever change their stance for the sake of
2050143	2050743	Thanks for watching!
2063837	2066498	Yeah, but a good idea didn't really work out, though, I don't think.
2066518	2067058	But you know what?
2067078	2067738	At least they tried.
2067939	2071840	And I would rather see them try and fail at it than not see them try at all.
2072220	2073661	They tried to be innovative.
2073921	2075101	I mean, look at the Virtual Boy.
2075241	2076642	Dumb idea, but you know what?
2076682	2077882	It's a step in the right direction.
2077982	2079023	The Great Migraine Machine.
2079183	2085485	Granted, they should have probably not gone monochrome red, and they probably should have made it less cumbersome, but you know...
2086603	2089025	It did have the best commercials.
2112614	2113235	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2131294	2134476	And they're going to be trying to make this money back.
2134696	2139758	And to be honest, it's another fucking goddamn Grand Theft Auto clone.
2140078	2142700	Except, oh, now it has Marlon Brando in it.
2143080	2145041	Oh, okay, that doesn't make it any better.
2145181	2148383	Well, now, to be fair, that article was more saying they didn't spend $810 million on the game.
2148403	2148783	Marketing, yeah.
2151084	2156246	Well, not just that, but the fact that they didn't release it at Christmas time cost them about $800 million of that.
2156586	2159767	But I'm sitting here going, wow, that still costs like multi-millions of dollars to make.
2159787	2161888	Of course, I'm not surprised because you have all the voice acting in it.
2161908	2164349	You're basically making a movie on a console.
2164669	2167170	But I'm like, I totally see what you're saying there.
2167410	2171911	Usually, these movie-to-games that they spend a lot of that money on are crap.
2172011	2173412	I can't think of a whole lot of good ones.
2173452	2174012	I'm sure there's some.
2174032	2174952	There's not coming to mind right now.
2175433	2179094	But you take a game like Tetris.
2180826	2181406	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2203553	2204234	You were right.
2204894	2205494	You were right.
2205675	2210158	Didn't even Nintendo say earlier that is not the reason why they delayed Twilight Princess?
2210278	2210458	Yeah.
2210778	2221866	And here's Miyamoto saying, and one of the most important features is that because Revolution can run GameCube software, when you play Twilight Princess on Revolution, you can take advantage of the Revolution controller.
2222787	2225809	Which makes Nintendo our Liar of the Week.
2226549	2227830	Congratulations, Nintendo.
2227850	2229271	You're our Liar of the Week.
2229311	2229791	Good job.
2231032	2231953	Now you're going to hell.
2232824	2233264	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2254913	2256314	Script Magazine Script Magazine
2271047	2276789	It's basically just sort of a day in the life of the production process for Silent Hill.
2277409	2284531	You know, talking with the producer in France, going over some of the lame ideas he started to bring up.
2285032	2288913	Like, well, no, we want to protect the integrity of the franchise.
2289833	2291014	It's a really neat article.
2291174	2292354	So I take it no dog ending.
2293564	2294666	That would be hilarious.
2294746	2296449	I think after the credits.
2297851	2300095	Like you stay after the credits and then there's a dog ending.
2300115	2300956	That would be great.
2301197	2301717	Or a UFO.
2304782	2306185	I hope they did that for the fans.
2306405	2307928	I'll be so happy.
2308671	2313832	Well, they were fully bringing up how awesome it was to work with Akira Yamaoka.
2313872	2314492	That was pretty cool.
2315752	2316973	But it's a very good article.
2317653	2323734	In fact, I'll tell you what, as soon as I can find the power supply for my scanner, I'll make it available for our listeners.
2324274	2326575	But I would suggest going out and buying the magazine.
2326815	2330115	Yes, because illegal reproductions are wrong, kids.
2331816	2332616	I can transcribe it.
2333156	2333496	Oh, there you go.
2334449	2334809	All right.
2335130	2335810	Very interesting.
2335850	2336911	Is that Script Magazine?
2337331	2338052	Script Magazine.
2338092	2339253	The I is in parentheses.
2339573	2342976	Now, you're probably not going to be able to walk into a grocery store and find it.
2343016	2344337	Actually, you can walk into Barnes & Noble.
2344377	2344757	Barnes & Noble.
2344777	2347359	You have to go to a more comprehensive magazine store.
2347379	2348800	I was at Borders when I saw it.
2349781	2355586	Actually, Tower would be very likely to carry it since they carry all sorts of interesting... I don't think they have that everywhere.
2356360	2356921	Thanks for watching!
2373726	2374446	Let's move on.
2374486	2375667	Let's go to another story.
2375807	2380389	Loki, regarding the PlayStation 3, there was some back and forth this week.
2380489	2388712	Right after the conference, people were saying, oh, that hard drive's not going to really come with the system or that's going to make it the $900 system.
2389012	2391693	Loki, tell us once and for all, what's the deal with the hard drive?
2391833	2392593	It is standard.
2392653	2397035	I mean, of course you're going to... You need the hard drive to play the games.
2397195	2399956	They've come out and said that it's not going to be like the Xbox 360 where...
2401624	2404265	Okay, if you don't have a hard drive, memory card, that would just be fine.
2404345	2406046	No, you need the hard drive to play the games.
2406566	2413289	So, of course, it's going to be standard with the system, and it was confirmed by Yahoo Games.
2414537	2417019	Wow, Yahoo Games is actually legitimate.
2417059	2418381	That's surprising.
2418621	2421223	I think that's a bigger shocker than the... Don't knock on them.
2421884	2423345	Yahoo featured our podcast once.
2424026	2425267	Don't hurt our relations there.
2425647	2427289	Oh, I'm sorry.
2428610	2431273	In that case, Yahoo's so smart.
2433114	2441939	Alright, speaking of hard drives, you may remember last week I called a certain gaming company a bunch of bastards for this news article.
2442019	2443400	I do want to say one thing real quick.
2443500	2450624	I think it's a great idea that they are including the hard drive because now developers can develop with the hard drive in mind, unlike the 360.
2452111	2460294	And speaking of the 360, I kind of called Microsoft a bunch of bastards last week over this news article, and it turned out to be false.
2461234	2480741	The 100 gigabyte hard drive rumor that was going around a couple weeks ago, or actually last week, starting from the Best Buy employee or something, they actually got word officially from Microsoft, from the global marketing team, saying, we haven't announced any additional hard drives for the Xbox 360.
2481801	2484283	Beyond the 20 gigabyte version available today.
2484423	2490347	So I'd like to offer an apology to Microsoft for calling you guys bastards.
2490947	2493709	And Halo Rocks, please forgive me.
2495510	2496230	They're still bastards.
2497851	2498472	But not for that.
2499052	2499753	For other things.
2500532	2502273	Many, many other things.
2502453	2505255	We could find a reason why all these gaming companies are bastards though this week.
2505295	2506476	I mean, Nintendo lied.
2506496	2510038	Nintendo lied to us.
2512060	2513561	I feel steep pain in my soul.
2513601	2519325	Well, you know, chat room's saying that we're being too hard on Nintendo because maybe that wasn't... Where did that come from?
2519345	2524908	Nintendo Maniac 64, of course, defending Nintendo saying, that doesn't mean that's why it was delayed.
2525269	2529852	I mean, that Zelda thing isn't necessarily the only reason why it was delayed.
2530772	2533233	Come on, good incentive, right?
2533994	2537716	I think back to the Zelda games that were on Game Boy Color and the Game Boy Advance.
2538256	2544719	Why didn't they come out to the end of Game Boy Color for that exact same reason to transition people onto Game Boy Advance with one of their biggest franchises?
2544900	2545780	I'm not surprised at all.
2546260	2547521	I have a question for Nintendo.
2547941	2549362	Why didn't they give us the Satellaview?
2551457	2552898	I had the best version of Zelda ever
2574072	2576115	or we would never do that to you guys.
2576195	2577256	No, we wouldn't.
2577296	2587908	The bad thing is that all these magazines put their April issues out in mid-March so now there's all these lies coming to you from these gaming magazines saying, oh, it's an April Fool's joke.
2587928	2588429	God, that sucks.
2588469	2589450	We're on the second.
2589650	2591833	We're broadcasting on the second.
2592093	2594436	If only one more day we could have fun at that show.
2594836	2596817	It's like, today we're doing it without a script!
2596837	2597297	Woohoo!
2597317	2606341	Alright, so now we would like to tell you about some of the real lies being spread this week by gaming magazines under the guise of April Fool's jokes.
2606401	2607422	Loki, what's the first one?
2607782	2614485	The first one is, I'm not necessarily going to call this an April Fool's joke because I'm not really certain if it is.
2615445	2621808	Basically, it's some Duke Nukem Forever gameplay footage that was featured and leaked to the internet, I guess.
2622148	2623049	And it looks like an in...
2623934	2626576	DarkSakura, what's another big lie under the guise of April Fool's?
2653544	2655905	Halo 3, The Ape...
2672652	2683426	who said he transcribed an article about the game from an upcoming issue of Game Informer Magazine, which is GameStop's big magazine.
2684808	2690375	It basically said that the game was going to have huge persistent worlds built around a modified Halo 2 engine.
2691156	2695638	That was going to feature Master Chief and would have a co-op mode for up to four players.
2695818	2699640	But according to Bungie, it's a big pile of poo.
2700541	2706543	To quote, he said, We can't smack him for an April Fool's gag, not like we never did any.
2707304	2707684	Ha ha ha!
2708726	2710648	Halo Combat Evolved Xbox Live Marketplace
2727623	2730305	But not actually going to happen here.
2731146	2734368	At least they're saying here that this is not likely to happen.
2734409	2736370	It's probably their April Fool's joke.
2737231	2746698	But you logically think, could Microsoft eventually jump on this bandwagon because you got Sony saying they're going to do the same thing with the PlayStation games?
2747119	2748960	Maybe this isn't such an unrealistic possibility.
2748980	2751122	I think you're going to need a bigger hard drive if that's the case.
2752943	2753344	Interesting.
2754264	2754965	Well, we shall see.
2756383	2757564	All right, so moving on.
2758885	2761428	Let's go from lies to apologies.
2761468	2763890	This has been a show full of apologies and lies.
2764570	2766692	Loki, who's saying sorry now?
2766972	2771917	Starforce, and I wouldn't really say that this is... I don't know.
2771937	2773518	There's sort of an apology here.
2773578	2776721	Starforce, if you guys remember back to last week, they were the ones that were reporting.
2777322	2782266	They're the company that does security, cop protection software, and this...
2784138	2797328	Basically, they were leaking a torrent of Galactic Civilization 2 on their website just because Stardock didn't want to use Starforce's copper protection schemes.
2797448	2800510	So, they said, yeah, we're sorry.
2802051	2808936	But it's just like, you know, basically, I don't know, it's just,
2810101	2813143	I was listening to some other podcasts this week that were talking about this company.
2813423	2814343	They're really evil.
2814923	2818445	I mean, I never really, because I don't play a lot of PC games.
2818805	2824748	I mean, granted, between Final Fantasy XI and World of Warcraft, that's enough PC games for me because that's most of my PC game time.
2825068	2830210	But I never really realized they practically install spyware on your computer, it sounds like.
2830290	2831651	It's kind of fascinating.
2832231	2833292	I'm surprised they get away with it.
2833312	2838634	Yeah, so basically they apologized for the incident and said they took down the link.
2840405	2844427	But it's just like, it's still pretty rotten to be doing that.
2844467	2845367	It's a little too late.
2846568	2852030	You know, here's the thing guys, and I see a lot of people in our chat room right now are going, yeah, F them, they suck, da da da.
2852050	2853890	Here it is guys, vote with your dollars.
2854471	2858192	If you don't like this company, don't buy anything that their product is involved with.
2858952	2859393	End of story.
2859673	2863494	And then soon you will no longer see them because they'll go out of business because nobody's buying their stuff.
2864034	2865415	Vote with your dollars if you don't like it.
2866493	2866893	I love Sonic Team!
2895407	2898548	My God, do we know anything about why he's doing this or anything?
2898788	2907549	There's a speculation that he's going to be creating his own company that may be aligned with Sega, but that's, again, speculation.
2908530	2913471	But this is the man that brought us Sonic the Hedgehog, Phantasy Star Online, Knights.
2914391	2918952	So pretty much like all the great Sega games you start to think about, this guy made them.
2919032	2920252	Yuji Naka is the man.
2920848	2922709	That would be like Miyamoto leaving Nintendo.
2924049	2926490	Miyamoto left Nintendo, Nintendo would crumble.
2927871	2931272	Sega's already... I'm sorry, Sammy Sega.
2932673	2933693	I have to say Sammy Sega.
2934533	2936694	Then again, Sammy did bring us Guilty Gear or so.
2937134	2946818	But still, Sega... Having something like this even be rumored, it just sort of makes me think how the mighty have fallen.
2947559	2948159	I know, I'll be...
2949289	2952031	We're not going to have a Sega in 20 years if they keep this up.
2979502	2979862	Well, we'll see.
2979882	2980583	It hasn't happened yet.
2980883	2984045	I just mean for the greatness that Sega was.
2985486	2986806	All right.
2987007	2988848	Loki, here's something else to mourn about.
2990088	2992810	DarkSakura, put this on your list of things to talk about when you're mourning.
2993430	2994871	What do we have to mourn over as well?
2995372	2998854	Well, you know, it was a good run or roll, I should say.
3000014	3006598	The Katamari team has broken up, and so we're not going to be seeing any more Katamari games.
3006858	3007499	How do you know this?
3008234	3009875	Because the website says so.
3010995	3016758	KatamariDamasi.jp There was a three-day countdown.
3016858	3019579	And people were anticipating, oh, hey, there's a countdown.
3019619	3023021	Last time it was the announcement of me and my Katamari.
3023241	3024801	Now it's, no.
3025742	3026322	We're done.
3027643	3029704	Maybe it's a really bad April Fool's joke?
3030884	3034846	Well, the creator of Katamari Damasi himself has said he doesn't like video games.
3036309	3036910	Playground Equipment
3060157	3067322	I think the problem with that being is that even if they decide to try to keep going with it, it's not going to have the same feeling that the games now do.
3071245	3077910	When you have a recipe and you have it at the same restaurant and then another restaurant tries to copy it, it just doesn't taste the same way.
3078751	3079371	It's the same thing.
3079972	3080392	Interesting.
3082153	3100400	You know, and at the same time, you can kind of maybe respect this decision, honestly, because part of the problem with games today as it is, that Katamari Damacy kind of really went against the grain with this when it first came out, is that too damn many sequels, too many copies of other games, too many, you know, of the same thing.
3100660	3111424	And Katamari Damacy was well respected for breaking that mold, so I think maybe this is why they've decided to quit now, before they become the thing that they were representative against.
3112166	3115007	So at that time, you kind of have to respect them.
3115647	3120309	I just hope that at least these guys will put out more games of some type.
3120369	3132493	And even if it's not another Katamari Damacy game, you've got to admit, that sense of humor that's in Katamari Damacy, that level that the music is at and all that stuff, that could lend itself great to another very original concept.
3132553	3133133	So I hope...
3133809	3136530	We see many of the brains behind Team Katamari.
3136590	3144113	Even if they broke up, many of the same big minds behind it create something new that can be the Katamari Damacy of next year.
3144674	3145094	So we'll see.
3145394	3150236	Or just, I don't know, just get part of the development team and start a new team.
3150596	3152317	It doesn't take the same minds to create the game.
3152337	3155418	They didn't really change much from both games anyways.
3155498	3158279	I mean, I don't know.
3158320	3159360	Comments from our chat room.
3159913	3164355	Arsef says, yeah, too many sequels would defeat the inventiveness of the series.
3164815	3168337	Xander C says, I hope he makes more games, but hopefully it'll be original stuff.
3168677	3170058	No more Katamari, please.
3170798	3171738	So there you have it.
3172079	3174940	So maybe fans are just kind of accepting this, that yep, you know what?
3175460	3176921	This is what you gotta do to stay original.
3178468	3181269	All right, well, you know, at the same time, we can be original.
3181329	3183110	We can also celebrate the classics.
3183150	3186532	Now, you guys know the Walk of Game down at the Metreon in San Francisco.
3186552	3188873	And, of course, now, the Metreon was just sold recently.
3188933	3202780	We don't know how this is going to affect the Walk of Game, but they just recently had their 2006 ceremony where they inducted John Carmack, who was technical director at ID Software, you know, Doom, Quake, that stuff, Sid Meier, Civilization, among many other things.
3202820	3203100	I mean, that...
3203620	3204901	That guy is honestly a god to me.
3204941	3207362	I mean, Sid Meier has made some of the greatest PC games of all time.
3208263	3209844	And they were lifetime achievement, guys.
3210504	3213886	Also, some games that were celebrated for their characters as well as being a game.
3214306	3221951	EverQuest, Final Fantasy, Lara Croft, and StarCraft all being inducted into the Walk of Game, which I have yet to really see.
3222071	3224072	So I might have to take a trip to the Metreon before it gets...
3224620	3227942	Turn into the Mega Mall that Westfield might turn it into.
3227962	3235467	I kind of am hoping that maybe Westfield won't screw it up, and they'll try to still keep it like a gaming center, like make it appeal to gamers.
3235507	3237068	That would make me a happy kid.
3237208	3239749	They'll put an EB in there as well, or GameStop.
3240410	3244072	But they have the official Sony store, so that would be kind of competing, so I don't know if they could do that.
3244933	3245694	Sega Land Theme Park
3267441	3268722	Why not Sega come open a store?
3268762	3271864	Some of the third-party developers kind of sell off some of their big things.
3272204	3273885	Namco could have a store, you know, all this.
3274085	3274746	Konami store.
3274766	3275766	It'd be kind of cool.
3276547	3280769	I bet in five years it's going to turn into a Pokemon Center.
3280889	3283291	Why not open up a Pokemon Center in it somewhere, you know?
3283491	3285432	Because Pokemon Centers are evil!
3285552	3286473	But you know what?
3286493	3288994	Some people like it, so why not have it for them as well?
3289034	3290015	You know, something for everybody.
3290435	3292437	I think that would be cool to keep it like a gaming-themed place.
3292457	3294658	Some people worship the devil, too, but that doesn't make it right.
3298354	3300716	People are entitled to their own religion.
3301216	3308061	Speaking of people worshipping the devil, a certain game franchise has turned 25 this week, and we're not sure how this franchise keeps going.
3308702	3311924	So maybe it is Divine Darkness Intervention or something.
3312564	3313665	Frogger has turned 25.
3315086	3321091	Don't get me wrong, Frogger is a wonderful game 25 years ago, but these recent releases... Let me put it this way.
3321191	3321671	Not so great.
3321691	3323432	The original Frogger was a really good game.
3324133	3327115	Every other Frogger game or game that has Frogger in the title...
3329124	3334548	Actually, I had a game on Commodore 64 called Frogger 2 3-Deep that was kind of neat.
3335428	3335989	And that's it.
3337870	3339891	Then after that, I'll back up what you're saying.
3340371	3350858	Frogger... Yeah, pretty much Frogger nowadays is just... You see Frogger on a game or Frogger like Helmet Chaos, you're like, wow, crap.
3352039	3352919	That's what that is.
3353060	3353560	It's crap.
3354160	3354340	Nope.
3355121	3355301	I mean...
3357077	3358378	Not much you can really do with Frogger.
3358418	3359159	It's such a simple game.
3359179	3361120	Well, they still have another game coming out.
3362541	3365203	I played the Frogger that they came out with on PlayStation.
3365223	3369366	I think that was about the last time I played a Frogger game because I just wasn't into it.
3369386	3370366	It wasn't that great.
3370466	3373148	Yeah, now they're trying to get a storyline.
3373369	3373809	No.
3374669	3375810	No, no, no.
3375830	3377872	It's just a goddamn game.
3378412	3383255	I think Frogger would be a good game on Xbox Live Arcade.
3383776	3383956	But,
3384525	3386386	Do it super ultra realistic.
3386646	3387887	Have it look like a real frog.
3388127	3389407	Have the traffic look real.
3390148	3390988	That would be cool.
3391268	3393829	Multiplayer might be kind of fun, like a race to the end.
3393990	3394890	I want to be the driver.
3395110	3395910	You should be able to push.
3396691	3397211	There you go.
3397291	3402614	Think about the innovation there with Pac-Man and on that Pac-Man versus, some people could be the ghosts.
3403034	3405955	Why not have some people be the drivers on Frogger?
3407696	3411258	Or have your frog with the ability to push other frogs in front of the car.
3412339	3413781	That would be excellent.
3414342	3414542	See?
3414562	3415683	Someone needs to play the crocodile.
3415703	3416164	You know what?
3417085	3421671	Konami, you guys need to hire us to breathe some new life into your Frogger franchise.
3422512	3423293	Seriously.
3423933	3424234	You know what?
3424274	3430121	Maybe there's another way to breathe life into the Frogger franchise and some people are trying to imitate this in real life.
3430201	3430762	What's this about?
3432369	3439204	What do you get when you combine lots of alcohol, a Roomba, and something that looks like a frog?
3440025	3442070	Well, you get real life Frogger.
3443755	3451459	Basically, they have taken this Bluetooth-enabled Roomba, a green t-shirt, and lots of alcohol, and they made it cross traffic.
3454981	3462484	They made it cross a four-lane highway about ten times before it got run over by a Toyota 4Runner.
3462745	3467907	And to be honest, this is way more entertaining than any of those Frogger games that have come out recently.
3469168	3470028	I would do this.
3470108	3471749	This would be something I would totally do.
3472349	3473370	And this is excellent.
3474414	3474794	Pac-Man Ghosts
3491516	3496319	You know, in a future episode, we need to do another listless and games I would like to see imitated in real life.
3496559	3497840	We need to think about that one.
3497860	3499000	Maybe next week if we have time.
3499020	3499360	We'll see.
3499821	3500341	We'll have to.
3500501	3501542	That's a brilliant idea.
3501602	3503763	My hat's off to those kids who put that together.
3503783	3504483	They're ready for booze.
3504863	3505384	I guess.
3505544	3506164	Yeah, wow.
3506705	3507045	All right.
3509076	3511197	Techmo has a new automatic update for the Xbox 360 for Dead or Alive 4.
3511237	3512077	It's meant to...
3530387	3536429	Adjust some of the interface and balance the characters, tweaking the launcher moves, stun moves, sweeps.
3536709	3540210	A few of the character speeds are changed, some sped up, some slowed down.
3542030	3547912	Some of the power moves do less damage, encouraging players to be more skillful.
3551945	3556006	When you download the update, you will also have the option to reset your battle tactics.
3557266	3560907	But your Zac money, avatars, all that will still be the same.
3561507	3563928	The DOA4 update is available on Xbox Live.
3564328	3567828	I wonder if it will make the last boss less of a cheap bitch.
3569489	3570009	Because she is!
3570549	3570829	I know.
3571769	3575170	I honestly haven't really super duper played a whole lot of Dead or Alive 4.
3576210	3581051	And I've been too afraid to play online because I'll sit and watch some of those battles and I'll go like, you know what, I'm going to get my ass kicked.
3582553	3584375	I need to play with people on my own level.
3584435	3587878	Where are the handicapped players on Xbox Live?
3587898	3588919	Why aren't you ever on?
3588959	3592762	Those people who need a handicap on their game because they're not very good.
3593383	3593923	That's what I need.
3593983	3594424	I can admit it.
3594484	3595685	I'm not great at every game.
3596846	3603572	I was talking to somebody recently online who assumed that because I did this show every week that I'm good at every video game, and that's so not the case.
3603892	3606154	There's some games I'm good at, I'll admit.
3606474	3609657	I'm pretty good at a lot of puzzle games, but not every game.
3609997	3610457	Please, no.
3610497	3618820	I mean, if you're going to add me to Xbox Live, if you dig through the Orange Lingerie forums and decide to add me to Xbox Live, be prepared that I'm not going to be much of a challenge in some of the games.
3619300	3620661	In other games, it's on.
3620761	3623502	I will kick your butt on some of those arcade games, but we'll see.
3625203	3626623	Rob needs food badly.
3627683	3628304	Not gauntlet.
3628344	3628704	Gauntlet.
3629815	3631417	Gauntlet was more fun for me when I was a kid.
3631577	3632899	I find it to be too repetitive now.
3633179	3634220	We need Crystal Castles.
3635361	3640147	I think our webmaster, VXChaseNXV, I think he challenged me to Root Beer Tapper when that one comes out on live.
3640427	3641489	So you're on, bitch.
3641709	3642189	You're on.
3642450	3643771	You have to let us know how that one goes.
3643931	3644292	We'll see.
3645133	3645653	Guess what?
3646054	3646194	What?
3646858	3655883	2K Games has announced that Civ City Rome, it's a building strategy based on civilization, is currently in development for PC.
3656843	3658664	It's being produced by Firefly Studios.
3658724	3660185	They brought a stronghold.
3660985	3662746	And with Firaxis Games.
3663967	3670870	According to 2K Games, it's going to have the most detailed look at Roman life ever depicted on a computer screen.
3671911	3672431	That's a quote.
3672734	3675177	That is, until the sieves come out.
3675477	3681204	And then, you know, then you'll have your nice Roman family that you've got to, you know... Yeah, I got nothing.
3681224	3687791	You know, visit to the, you know, annual orgy and... Are we going Greek or Roman here?
3687831	3688191	Oh, I know.
3688332	3688932	That was Roman.
3689173	3689613	I know, I know.
3690074	3690334	Okay.
3690754	3691515	It was also Greek.
3692176	3692917	Well, yeah, but...
3693928	3701255	Anyway, moving on from orgies, you'll start off with a small settlement build until you have an imperial city.
3701315	3711486	You can have amphitheaters, legionnaire forts, weapon workshops, circuses, gladiator school, a whole bunch of stuff, and then you can set it on fire.
3711746	3714769	So like most, really you get to burn your city in a day?
3715396	3715756	You could.
3716077	3716377	Cool.
3717298	3720320	So this is like most civilization games, you know.
3720380	3723703	Start small, get big, take over world, repeat.
3724263	3733871	There are screenshots available, which I will be posting in our chat room, but these can be seen from, if you go to Eurogamer.net, the links are there.
3733991	3735893	And actually, I've looked this through.
3736673	3737714	It's very pretty.
3738115	3739696	Very, very pretty.
3741657	3742058	Lots of...
3742922	3743963	You can have ports.
3744363	3747024	One of the captures is of a port city.
3747624	3749245	You've got orchards.
3750286	3754468	You have a huge, massive city with a coliseum.
3755688	3756549	Oh, that does look pretty neat.
3757870	3758930	I'm going to link this in our chat room.
3787321	3788382	It's still kind of neat, I guess.
3788662	3796729	Well, what my hope is for games like this is that we see an actual degree of historical accuracy in it.
3797310	3798591	You know, because I think that
3800243	3807208	I'm sure that a lot of the people who know me off the show know I have a very big interest in anthropology and ancient history.
3807868	3817695	And I think something like this not only would be good for the whole strategy building side of things, but also a chance to offer a little bit of a history lesson.
3817736	3823580	Well, civilization was pretty good with that because the world leaders that you would come across would be kind of like how they were.
3823880	3824741	Siv-4 is getting an expansion!
3850413	3850954	Oh, very cool.
3851174	3852857	You know, I still haven't played Civ 4.
3852897	3854300	I feel really bad.
3854380	3858387	It's one of those things where it's like I just don't have the time to play everything I want to play.
3859269	3860471	I really want to try this out sometime.
3860919	3867325	Well, the expansion is called Civilization for Warlords with new units that are called Warlords.
3867965	3872889	It'll have some of the greatest military leaders and new scenarios.
3873049	3874571	You can change history.
3875472	3879415	You can take control of the ancient Chinese kingdom, fight in the Peloponnesian Wars.
3880356	3884920	You can join Alexander the Great, become ruler of the Vikings, pillage Europe.
3886021	3887322	That's kind of cool.
3887362	3888263	You can be Genghis Khan.
3889554	3890394	That's kind of cool.
3890414	3890794	Yeah.
3891214	3906438	You know, and honestly, maybe I should just wait until all the expansions for Civ 4 are out because then there'll be that gold box set because there's always a gold box set at the end of every Civilization's lifespan that's like 20 bucks that has everything in it.
3906758	3907938	So maybe I'm okay waiting.
3908438	3908799	We'll see.
3909759	3914480	Alexander the Great in this game looks kind of historically accurate.
3915380	3916080	Let's just leave it at that.
3916100	3918661	For those of us who have studied a little bit of history.
3919443	3920223	Alright, anything else?
3921204	3924525	Well, I'm also posting that clip in the chat room.
3924645	3927165	Oh, by the way, our chat room is at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
3927185	3932927	Click on chat, of course, unless you're listening to this on the podcast or via our AllGames.com syndication.
3933207	3938829	But I do know that when this show's playing on AllGames.com, sometimes their chat room is chatting about the show a little bit, so check out their chat room.
3939329	3949232	And, of course, you can always send us emails, and it's always just incentive, too, if you want to be a part of the live chat, Sunday nights, 6 o'clock Pacific time, OrangeLoungeRadio.com, we do this show live.
3949540	3952403	Act of War, High Treason for the PC, Final Fight Streetwise
3969777	3971839	The Blockbuster Exclusive
3999913	4005302	Street Racing Syndicate, Elder Scrolls IV, Oblivion, The Godfather, Worms Open Warfare
4010905	4012746	and, of course, we'd like to take it back to the U.S.
4012826	4013627	with what's on the U.S.
4013567	4013947	's plate.
4013987	4015167	Loki, what are we getting this week?
4015668	4021771	We're looking at Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, of course, finally coming out for the 360.
4021811	4022932	That's this week?
4023252	4024132	That's this week.
4024553	4025973	I completely forgot that was this week.
4026194	4026774	Oh, my gosh.
4027154	4027454	Yes.
4028495	4032257	Mimai Katamari, of course, that's going to be awesome.
4032737	4035039	Milgar Acid 2, really good.
4036653	4037534	What else was really good?
4037634	4039175	Tal's Curse of the Demon.
4039755	4040355	Remember that one?
4040696	4042557	Yeah, I don't know.
4042657	4045019	Only if you're a hardcore role-playing game person.
4045219	4046019	Otherwise, skippable.
4046339	4047120	The Godfather.
4047140	4048861	That's really sweet.
4049622	4055025	Worms Open Warfare on NDS and PSP, which is going to be really sweet.
4056206	4062370	And then, of course, Blazing Angels on Xbox and Xbox 360, which is also really cool.
4062830	4065432	And Capcom Classics Collection Remixed on the PSP.
4066328	4069210	which includes Captain Commando and Street Fighter and Strider.
4087339	4089260	There was a Tetris TS commercial on TV this week.
4089880	4092221	Some of the gaming sites picked it up, but I actually saw it for the first time.
4092301	4094022	I was watching some show and they aired it.
4094282	4094802	It's kind of funny.
4094942	4095702	How did I forget?
4096363	4098163	Karaoke Revolution Country is coming out this week.
4098323	4099264	No way.
4101922	4103342	and of course next week, Beatmania.
4125516	4129598	So I'll probably just pick up the first three and wait a little bit to hear the reviews of Elder Scrolls a little more.
4129618	4130098	How about this?
4130198	4133079	How about you just see my copy of Oblivion when I buy it this week?
4133119	4133519	Here we go.
4133539	4136480	And then maybe you could borrow my copy of Me and My Katamari or something.
4136500	4138241	Which reminds me, I want the PSP back.
4139981	4141242	You will get your PSP back.
4141302	4142682	I have a funny story about your adapter.
4143163	4143263	Oh?
4144763	4148264	Well, I loaned a Guanagirl my camera, and I gave her your adapter with it.
4148985	4151005	Because it looked like the one for my camera.
4153564	4154145	I'll get it back.
4154185	4156611	Guana Girl, if you're listening, I want that back.
4157252	4158314	Or I'm sending out the hitman.
4158334	4159437	I got my camera back.
4159457	4159858	I'm teasing.
4159878	4160339	It's all good.
4160780	4161201	That's cool.
4161702	4163044	I just don't have your adapter.
4163476	4163996	Whatever.
4164296	4170460	I also, real quick, since we were just on the UK news, we actually have one of our UK listeners tuned in tonight, Simmel.
4170720	4176484	Now, that's hardcore, to be listening live when you're living in a different time zone, because I know we've had in the past... It's 3 a.m.
4176544	4176804	there.
4177184	4177925	That's, wow.
4178045	4185729	And we've had folks from Australia listen live, too, and I know that's more like afternoon time, but that's awesome that you guys are tuning in, listening live in those different time zones.
4185749	4186890	Hooray for our fellow night owls.
4187150	4187630	That's awesome.
4188331	4191533	Man, I just wouldn't want to have to calculate the time zones, that's all.
4194195	4196717	Too much brain work-y stuff.
4197037	4199259	I moderate on the UK site.
4199499	4204623	I think our streaming site, Live365, will auto-calculate on the scheduler.
4204923	4209046	Like, if you go to look at our scheduler of live programs, it'll auto-calculate the times for you, I think?
4210037	4211777	So check that out on our station page.
4211817	4212077	Okay.
4212538	4214018	For UK, add five hours.
4214538	4217278	For France, add one or two more hours.
4217659	4222019	Anyways, as I was going to mention, I was going to mention real quickly next week, which is really cool.
4222460	4224560	Beatmania, Kingdom Hearts 2.
4224940	4226400	Oh, God.
4226440	4228661	What is up with the end of March?
4228741	4231261	Is the end of March usually this big of a gaming time?
4231461	4232402	I don't remember this last year.
4232462	4234022	It drops off next month, so let me put it that way.
4234582	4236662	And, of course, more stuff for May.
4236822	4239243	Far Cry, Instincts, Predator, and Rumble Roses.
4239838	4240098	DarkSakura.com
4256371	4258232	GameStop gift certificates, baby.
4258292	4262254	I'm going to buy you the Game Boy Advance version of Cats, which is coming out.
4262274	4266976	Yes, and I'm going to buy that a SpongeBob SquarePants Yellow Adventure game for you, because you should love that.
4267216	4268617	I could use it for Shermie's litter box.
4268657	4268997	Thank you.
4271858	4272199	All right.
4272219	4274300	For those who don't know, Shermie is my cat.
4274360	4274780	That's right.
4274820	4275280	There we go.
4275460	4277141	Named after a video game character.
4277774	4278835	Fatal Fury Fatal Fury
4299358	4300539	Fatal Fury 2 Samurai Shodown
4324144	4329926	Ken and Ryu were ripped off for Art of Fighting with Ryo and Robert.
4329986	4330486	I remember.
4330726	4341748	Capcom, to make fun of them, came up with Dan Hibiki in Street Fighter who wears a gi like Ryo and has Robert Garcia's hair.
4341888	4343208	I never made that connection.
4343508	4344128	It's awesome.
4344848	4348009	See, I used to play as Rob in Art of Fighting because he's got a good name.
4348709	4349009	There you go.
4350109	4353590	Alright, anyway, it is time to go ahead and break for this half of our show.
4353650	4357191	We will be back with a little more Orange Lounge Radio after the break.
