14367	23649	Tonight, March 12th, 2006, the PSP gets a facelift, Guitar Hero 2 is announced, and we talk about some of the best games never released.
27690	38614	Orange Lounge Radio Hello everybody and welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio, this being episode number 176 of
40560	42261	for this March the 12th of 2006
68602	69983	Anyway, my name is Rob Roberts.
70003	70983	You might know me as Sky.
71023	74764	Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
75144	75424	Boo.
75664	76184	How you doing?
76905	78305	Ugh.
78425	79105	What's frustrating?
79265	81546	You were in such a good mood just like two minutes ago.
81846	84367	I wasn't in a good mood because your mocha attacked me.
84967	87288	I do appreciate the... I'm chocolatey good.
88608	88968	Damn it.
89668	94470	Well, now you smell like chocolate, so... I smelled like cherries before.
95157	95697	I'd rather.
95937	98719	You know, chocolate-covered cherries is a delicacy in some places.
100740	102681	Say hello also to Tech Master Loki.
103262	103502	Hi.
103782	104342	How you doing?
104983	105843	I'm doing great.
106023	106283	All right.
106583	106984	Sounds good.
107704	110426	Once in a while, we like to invite somebody special to come on the show.
111046	113427	Say hello to our local buddy, Bugged.
113828	114708	I'm just special now?
115669	116589	Yeah, you're very special.
116689	116949	Okay.
117129	118650	Bugged has known me for how long?
118810	119691	How long have you known me, Bugged?
119711	120571	I can't admit this.
120951	121172	What?
121352	121792	No, I can't.
122048	122268	Why?
122408	123429	I just can't.
123549	124289	Well, then I'll say it.
124329	127470	It's probably been at least... 17 years?
127990	128450	You're kidding.
129091	129651	Oh, my gosh.
129711	131311	No, I guess it has been 10 years since high school.
131331	133032	That's why I didn't want to... Oh, my God.
133192	133252	See?
133612	134092	Exactly.
135173	138374	Some of our listeners are 17, even younger than that.
138474	139014	Oh, my gosh.
139054	139294	All right.
139334	140675	Well... I'll go get the canes.
140835	141095	All right.
142031	145672	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
172116	173457	I quit school to play video games.
173897	176559	Way to set an example for those 17-year-olds listening.
176779	178900	I dropped a class due to time constraints.
179000	181401	I've played Animal Crossing and Puzzle Fighter.
182942	183662	Puzzle Fighter?
183702	184503	Now that's an oldie but goodie.
184563	189085	And we've had some burnout going on in the house, and I've been avoiding it like the plague.
189126	189406	Why?
189806	191047	Because that game gives me a headache.
191307	192647	Oh, because of all the motion and stuff?
193288	194829	That's right.
194849	198871	No, because of the really loudness that Dan has our TV turned up to you.
199895	201177	Puzzle Fighter Puzzle Fighter Puzzle Fighter
213188	216591	That made me twitch because it just made me realize that, yes, I am older than you are.
216751	217271	Not by much.
217311	224677	Because what I was playing in college was the Saturn had just come out and my friend imported one and we were playing Gundam.
225057	230981	If it makes you feel better, that was like... KOF 95 and I had a PlayStation in my room and we were playing Toshinden all the time.
231182	232743	If it makes you feel better, this was like...
234051	234931	My junior year.
235031	239193	My freshman year was all about Super Mario Kart because I was the only kid in the dorm with a Super Nintendo.
239213	240273	I had a Super Nintendo.
240693	243014	And by the way, you're making me cry because of next month.
243454	245975	You're also one of the few that were sober.
246555	247855	My birthday is next month.
247895	250536	That's right, but you're having a big birthday extravaganza, right?
251436	251897	Can't wait.
252337	254977	Where I get so drunk I forget that it's my birthday.
256918	258499	And this year you might need that.
258879	259779	But don't we still love you?
260299	261399	Age is just a number.
262120	262740	Yeah, yeah.
262920	263160	All right.
263860	265120	Loki, how's your gaming week been?
265480	265720	Good.
266921	277163	Been playing both the new Burnout, well, not quite new Burnout, new to the Xbox 360 Burnout, and Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter.
277863	280204	Burnout hasn't really changed.
280364	292367	They made it a lot blurrier and, I guess, higher resolution textures, but everything's so blurry and dark, it's, I don't know, it's tough sometimes finding out where you're going.
292527	293207	Headache-inducing?
293561	303143	Not headache-inducing, but just, you know, trying to see down like a tunnel where you're driving 200 miles an hour and everything's like I got cataracts or something.
303163	304363	It's just not good.
304763	316206	I don't like what they're doing with these games where they're putting this like halo effect on everything so to, you know, to hide the fact that the textures aren't quite as good as they should be and the edges aren't quite as smooth as they should be.
317346	318086	Listen, we know that
318803	329854	you know the case is that these textures aren't as good or the graphics aren't as good you don't need to try to hide it by making everything blurry don't pull a Nintendo 64 now I'm curious how does
330356	333998	Burnout is more racing, whereas Full Auto is more blowing stuff up.
334018	335379	Granted, they do have crash mode in Burnout.
335399	336039	Burnout lacks weapons.
356670	357451	Yeah, you don't have weapons.
357511	362293	And also, for some reason, the burnout on the 360 is a lot harder than I remember being on the PlayStation 2.
363794	366796	Like, you smash in the cars and they just do not want to crash.
367156	371399	It's really, you know, the AI is a lot harder this time, which I guess is good.
371479	374161	But, you know, the crash junctions are still fun stuff.
374181	375902	And the graphics are a little bit better.
375942	380104	The car models are more detailed, so you see more damage being done to them.
380164	383066	But it's not like, ooh, this is a brand new game.
383126	386348	I'm waiting for the next burnout to come out, and that'll be good.
387455	394767	I'm willing to take donations of Xbox 360s, Burnout, and FlatOut to make all these... Full auto.
395368	396790	Whatever the hell the thing's called.
396870	397571	FlatOut sucked.
397992	398813	It just FlatOut sucked.
399094	401618	FlatOut 2's coming out soon as well.
402445	403726	Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter.
404166	404906	What can I say about that?
405126	406127	The game is beautiful.
406667	408848	It's just amazing.
408928	412329	This is probably one of the killer apps for the 360.
412769	416471	The only problem is the learning curve is incredibly high.
416951	421433	For example, I have never played a Ghost Recon game in my life and I tried this today.
421993	450031	now granted it's very pretty and stuff and I kind of got the you know handle of how to work things but actually throwing me down into missions is about as effective as throwing me down into a mission in Call of Duty 2 on veteran mode and basically it's like you know walking into the Iraq war without any training and hoping to survive it's just not I don't know it could be fun I really need to like get better at it but the game itself looks amazing just
450826	455469	The whole story part where you're flying over Mexico City, it's just wow.
455849	456510	It's really good.
457670	461433	And then on top of that, of course, I've been playing Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories.
461913	466256	I'm very excited that they're going to be releasing a new Grand Theft Auto on the PSP soon.
466496	469838	And Liberty City Stories is supposed to be coming out on the PlayStation 2 at the end of April.
470318	471279	So that should be interesting.
471339	473280	Hopefully we'll have online multiplayer with that.
475339	476280	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
496149	496769	Thanks for watching!
508559	510460	and it says the number of races hasn't gone up.
510620	511560	So nothing's counting.
512221	514482	So I'm wasting my damn time on this stupid thing.
514522	516883	Isn't that because people are dropping before the race is actually finished?
517063	522085	I don't know what the case is, but there is a big problem with people dropping out of the races in this game.
523486	524326	It's really bad.
524947	526787	Half the players drop out at the very end.
527007	528168	You ever leave them negative feedback?
528448	529309	Because I have a problem.
529349	532411	People randomly boot me from games in Marble Blast.
532831	535332	And it's not like I'm any good, so I don't know why they're booting me from the game.
535352	537534	I don't even have a headset, so it's not like I can trash talk them.
537814	538875	But they boot me from the game.
539295	541976	So I leave them negative feedback when they do that.
542337	547540	Well, a lot of times it's hard for me to remember who's dropped out of the game because they're not going to appear at the very end.
548200	549621	Or, I don't know.
549901	552643	I'm trying to get the last few achievements in full auto.
552923	554164	And those are the online ones.
554224	555725	And I'm up to rank 8 right now.
556687	560648	So I only have two more to go, but it's really hard when it's not counting half the races that you're playing.
561029	563790	I could be playing it for three hours and only count two races.
563970	565730	I mean, it's just a waste of time.
566531	568311	And they really need to fix this kind of stuff.
569752	578655	We'll get into this later about how these games are coming out really glitchy and buggy, and they're just letting it go to market real quick because they can fix it later by patching it.
579455	581056	That's just a poor excuse of programming.
582337	582777	Anything else?
583938	584258	That's it.
585098	586778	Bugged, anything in your gaming week?
588239	589959	No, actually I started up Diablo 2 again.
591059	592720	I started up Diablo 2 again.
593480	599122	And been bringing up old characters that I've found laying around on other old CDs.
599722	601742	Is there still a big online community for Diablo 2?
602102	602523	I don't care.
603943	604663	You don't play online?
604843	605023	No.
605904	611245	Sometimes I'll play with other local people, set up Hamachi to do local network sort of thing.
612545	615906	With Hamachi, it looks like everybody's on the same network.
618286	621287	I haven't touched Diablo 2 in probably years.
621967	623308	Have you ever played World of Warcraft?
623528	623688	No.
623888	625028	I'm kind of surprised.
625688	627389	To me, there's a lot of similarities.
627449	629849	I don't do subscription games.
629869	630149	I know.
630229	631590	That whole lack of funding.
631890	633050	Have you ever thought about Guild Wars?
633410	633530	No.
634010	635711	Because Guild Wars isn't subscription-based.
635891	636911	Yeah, but it's not World of Warcraft.
642018	649504	I'll stick to Blizzard.
650845	652526	Definitely no fucking Final Fantasy shit.
653947	655248	You know what's funny about Final Fantasy?
655468	656849	Yeah, I know you two are going back into it.
657589	660291	Shane's trying to get me back into Final Fantasy XI and I think I'm going to do it.
661352	661632	Addict.
662301	664563	We're gonna start over on a new server.
664803	669247	Actually, though, you going back to that actually reminds me, I did do something else gaming-related.
669447	669547	Oh?
670187	672229	I'm downloading Ragnarok Online again.
672349	672889	Oh, God.
673230	673530	Addict.
673750	676712	I'm going to be playing Ragnarok Online on a private server.
676933	680556	Isn't that sad that we've all gone back to the crack games that we used to play?
680576	685459	I can't go back to World of Warcraft until after I get finances sold, so, like, well, crap.
686140	687081	I need gaming crack.
687101	689743	You know, I'm actually still paying for PSO Blueburst, and I forgot...
690535	693858	I'm gonna be playing, I'll play PSO So you have to pay for live plus PSO?
693878	696060	Unless you're Julie She hasn't had to, they haven't billed her
711294	716556	Thanks to the new setup on Xbox 360, I think games like Final Fantasy XI, that won't apply.
716856	719717	Because there's the whole Xbox Live Silver and Xbox Live Gold.
720297	721958	Well, you don't pay for Silver.
722018	723639	Silver comes with your Xbox 360.
724019	728400	And Silver is enough to get your account and your basics and see who's online and stuff.
728420	730241	But you can't actually play games against people.
730761	734203	But Silver is all you need to connect to play online.
734303	736023	And then you pay Sony to do their thing.
736063	737024	It's just like Windows XP.
737424	737824	In a way.
739048	741570	Yeah, you can get online, but you can't do shit until you actually buy the real stuff.
742151	747617	I think we're going to see a lot of connectivity between Windows Vista, especially, and the Xbox 360.
748358	752602	I think it's just very natural that Microsoft's going to try and interlink all that best we can.
752803	753223	Of course.
753604	754064	Absolutely.
754404	756947	Well, they're already trying to link the Media Center Edition 2005 version.
758420	762362	All the ads for the Gateway machines coming out with that are listing.
762842	765203	If you look at the bottom, it says compatible with Xbox 360.
765403	770105	Well, you know I saw some link on the internet somewhere where you can link your Mac to the Xbox 360 now.
770125	771466	Yeah, something like that.
771506	775868	So I was going to check that out for my new little lappy laptop, Mr. iBook.
776488	778369	But yeah, I'm probably going to get back into Final Fantasy XI.
778409	783251	At least I'm going to try it and see if I can rediscover my love for the game.
783271	787633	Because you know I left the game because the Gil selling thing got out of control and they banned all those people, so
788134	789394	I'm going to give it another shot.
789414	798056	We're going to try... I am really curious about this expansion that's coming out for Final Fantasy XI, The Treasures of Odd Organ, especially because now they have the Puppet Masterclass, which looks pretty cool.
798176	806398	They just added this week, announced, and you know, Blue Mage, and Shane's really excited about being a pirate, so he's trying to convince me to get back into it.
806538	807638	Or Corsair, sorry.
808098	810399	He's trying to convince me to get back into it, and I'm like, okay.
811199	811379	What?
811579	812679	Buck Pirate, Rectal Buccaneer.
813520	813900	Shut up.
814340	814800	Anything else?
816095	817997	Alright, let's see, my gaming week.
819118	822462	I've been playing a little bit of Xbox 360, Loki loaned me some games.
822482	825885	I was playing Perfect Dark Zero, which I just, I'm sorry, I couldn't get into it.
826246	828088	I see why people really enjoy this game.
828128	831231	I mean, as far as first-person shooters go, it is pretty intricate and a lot of fun.
831636	832197	RIDGERACER 6
852296	852816	Ridge Racer Cameo
870523	876005	The first time I played it, it was all like really overwhelming to me, like that first level that you have to go through.
876525	883087	But once you beat that level, like there's a story event that happens that kind of makes you start again from scratch.
883788	886629	And so I felt that was kind of a better way to kind of start the game for me.
886649	888409	It was kind of learning everything from scratch.
889029	889510	You know what I mean?
889690	893091	It was easier for me to get into when I wasn't like overwhelmed with everything at once.
893471	897332	But to the game's credit, it's got a pretty good help system in it.
897372	898993	Like you can always ask your little, like,
899628	903272	It's just like in Zelda, you know how that fairy follows you, and you can always ask the fairy for help?
903572	907997	Well, in this one, it's a little dude that's in the book, and you can always ask the book for help.
908177	910720	So, you know, it helps idiots like me find their way through the game.
910740	911641	Kind of like Partners in Time?
912562	915825	Oh, I'm sure a lot of games adapt this same idea now, so...
918099	921421	So I'm enjoying that game and just other stuff on Xbox Live Arcade.
922162	925184	I have probably downloaded damn near every game they offer on Xbox Live Arcade.
925224	925724	It's kind of sad.
926025	926565	Not everything.
926645	930608	I didn't get Backgammon or Hearts or any of that crap, but I did get... I got Bejeweled.
930688	931548	Why did I buy Bejeweled?
931608	931949	Why?
932389	933049	I don't know why.
933109	933390	I just...
934270	937391	I know, because I'm a sucker, and I wanted to play it in pretty, pretty HD.
939391	941812	I wanted to see if I could get some more achievement points, but here's the thing.
941852	945893	Bejeweled has harder achievement points than any game I've seen on Xbox Live Arcade.
945933	950674	Seriously, you have to be a Bejeweled master to get achievement points in that game.
950734	951234	It's sick.
951414	957195	The best bet for achievement points, and I was reading, they actually have this article that's on GameSpot right now.
957635	960856	It's how to score 6,000 easy achievement points.
961431	965334	and it's sports games are where you get the freaking easy-ass points.
966115	967876	Yeah, yeah.
968056	971118	I'm going to our chat room, www.orangeslaunchradio.com.
971138	973580	Click on chat, reading some feedback here in the chat room.
974621	976182	Let's see.
976282	978604	GK128 says, Cameo is terrible.
979845	981206	I don't know if I'd call it terrible.
981546	983067	Is it as good as Zelda?
983207	983808	Hell no.
984268	985489	Is it even as good as Fable?
985609	986390	Probably not.
986870	989092	But is it entertaining for me for a little while?
989192	989432	Yes.
989632	990012	Is it worth $60?
990052	990112	Yes.
991368	992609	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1014406	1016227	and you have to use these gems.
1016788	1018169	That just illustrates something to me.
1018329	1018569	What?
1018970	1025174	That when people say, oh this sucks, say specifically why so that people have some idea what you're talking about.
1025214	1027997	You know what, some of the dialogue in the game is a little lame.
1028117	1037984	Like they have these real lame jokes, like you said, like the old guy in the book and the little witch with one eye or whatever have this little back and forth thing going on, but it's really like canned humor.
1038104	1040706	It's like canned sitcom laughter type jokes.
1040846	1041427	It's pretty bad.
1041932	1049641	So honestly, you put a game like Cameo next to a Zelda or next to a better type of adventure game, and it is kind of sad.
1050842	1056649	But you have to remember, it's a launch title, and launch titles usually, unless you're Nintendo, aren't your best games.
1057550	1061234	One of my favorite games ever that was a launch title was Jumping Flash.
1062543	1063183	on PlayStation.
1063604	1064424	Oh, I don't even remember that.
1064444	1065805	It's a little mechanical rabbit.
1066445	1068386	And I played the hell out of the demo.
1068586	1070267	Well, here's the thing about Cameo.
1070287	1073969	Cameo's more like Spyro than it is like Zelda.
1074009	1077491	They were trying to position it to be like a Zelda killer, and no.
1078011	1082774	Well, isn't it more like the Banjo-Kazooie or Banjo-Tooie or whatever?
1082794	1086376	Which was just made to exist, not necessarily be good.
1088261	1100151	The one thing that they need to keep in mind is that when you're trying to come up with a game that's going to go against the big names, not only do they have quality to worry about, they also have reputation to worry about.
1100891	1107737	And I'm sorry, nothing's going to really dethrone the Zelda franchise, the Final Fantasy franchise, the Phantasy Star.
1108678	1109618	Besides itself.
1110779	1115223	I was reading in the chat room before the show started a lot of hate going around for Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.
1115723	1119106	Final Fantasy Mystic Quest Final Fantasy Mystic Quest Final Fantasy USA
1144653	1148374	Because that just, I could have sworn I read that somewhere and I'm like, that just makes us look bad.
1148434	1153096	I tried playing, well, then again, our Super Mario 2 was out over there, Super Mario USA.
1154376	1157637	But it had already existed over there in, what, Doki Doki Panic, right?
1157817	1159158	But differently, you know.
1159338	1160138	But it wasn't Mario.
1160358	1161439	Yeah.
1161539	1164140	It's amazing what a little Italian plumber can do for your game, huh?
1164440	1174263	But also keep in mind, though, that a lot of times when we get the RPGs over here, they repackage it for Japan as the international version because it's got more stuff in it.
1176280	1177280	Square does that an awful lot.
1177340	1178901	I think about 10 and all that stuff.
1179361	1181862	All right, let's get into some gaming news.
1182963	1186365	That's what we're here to do, let you guys know what's going on in the gaming world and bitch about it.
1187105	1188386	Loki, we're going to start off with you tonight.
1188406	1190527	Here's something some PSP owners might bitch about.
1190767	1191187	What do you think?
1191907	1193048	They redesigned the PSP.
1193268	1193968	Not surprising.
1194529	1196470	Actually, it's something we've been talking about for weeks now.
1198010	1203313	And it's just kind of, you know, I don't know, not very surprising.
1204012	1205652	Basically, this comes from Any Cool News.
1205912	1221735	It's this guy, Joseph Merrick, who's saying that he's got the insider information about their new PSP system, including that it's going to be a more sleeker, slimmed-down version of the PSP, including a 4GB flash drive and a digital camera.
1224176	1225756	No word on what the price is going to be.
1225856	1227036	How Nintendo of them.
1227116	1229117	But it's supposed to be released around Christmas.
1231811	1235614	Is this Sony doing a knee-jerk reaction to the insanity of the DS Lite in Japan?
1236255	1239877	I think so, but here's the thing about the PSP.
1241839	1248323	Unless you're pirating games to the memory stick, I don't know why you would need more than a gig.
1248784	1249064	I mean...
1250427	1251008	4 gigs 4 gigs 4 gigs
1279904	1283988	It's facing the user, so it would be used as a webcam.
1284248	1285289	We're watching you.
1285729	1290313	Which is kind of stupid, but obviously I'm sure that's going to be fixed later on.
1291454	1293136	I don't see the real need for this.
1293416	1297580	I mean, a 4 gig hard drive in there as well.
1297960	1299281	Is it going to be a hard drive or flash?
1299602	1300002	Flash.
1300062	1302084	It's going to be probably a micro drive or something like that.
1302905	1304286	Micro drive is hard drive.
1305208	1305588	or whatever.
1305608	1306689	NAND flash drive.
1308049	1308670	That makes more sense.
1309090	1312171	Because adding another rotating media just sucks more battery life.
1313032	1313512	Exactly.
1313632	1314933	So, I don't know.
1315053	1315693	It's interesting.
1315713	1319495	It's supposed to come out sometime around Christmas.
1319535	1324217	Hopefully the PS3 will be coming out at the same time because I heard they're having a lot of trouble with that.
1326358	1328900	Are they going to do different colors and all that stuff too?
1329140	1330020	I'm sure they'll do it.
1330640	1332221	They have white and black right now.
1332801	1333662	They'll probably come out with some
1334781	1337242	Other colors that can get blue, pink.
1337883	1343345	You know, I've been a little tough on the PSP lately, but it does sound like there are some good new stuff coming out for it.
1344306	1345306	Especially game-wise.
1345826	1349748	Hopefully with this new PSP, they'll come out with a second goddamn analog stick.
1350269	1352069	Like they friggin' need on this thing.
1352770	1354491	I wouldn't want them to change it that radically.
1355291	1361474	Because now me having a first-gen PSP who's not really interested in upgrading, I'd be totally screwed if games started supporting it.
1361494	1363575	It's just like the whole Xbox 360 hard drive thing.
1364235	1368360	If you've got a core with no hard drive, you're going to get screwed in some of these later releases when people require it.
1368380	1368860	So what?
1369181	1369762	Here's the thing.
1370022	1372965	I mean, look at the games that came out for the late PlayStation stuff.
1373165	1374867	They supported only the DualShock 2.
1375028	1376990	If you didn't buy a DualShock controller, you're fucked.
1377691	1379493	Oh well, that's going to be the case with this.
1379913	1391318	They needed to have a goddamn second analog stick on this because you try, you know, controlling, I don't know, say for example in Katamari, you try controlling your Katamari, the four buttons, doesn't work.
1391638	1392979	It's not as good as an analog stick.
1392999	1401502	They need another analog stick on there because it'll just be so much better for a lot, especially if they're first person shooter games that they have coming out for this, it'd be a whole lot better.
1402743	1403003	All right.
1403871	1405973	Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy XII
1422472	1426596	The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, Soul Calibur, Vagrant Story, Zelda The Wind Waker, and Nintendogs
1441328	1442389	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1466907	1468650	Have they played Vagrant Story?
1468690	1470472	Because it's not that great of a game.
1470652	1475299	Well, but maybe we have that whole audience in Japan versus audience in the US.
1476120	1477742	No, I played Vagrant Story.
1477762	1479865	I like the Japanese games.
1480506	1481227	It wasn't that good.
1482438	1484199	Famitsu begs to differ with you.
1484660	1491245	Anyway, of course, this score is now just building more and more excitement amongst the fanboys that, you know, OMG, this game's coming out soon.
1491265	1493987	Wait, do you know when Final Fantasy XII slated for the US?
1494287	1494928	I can't even remember.
1494968	1495888	It keeps getting juggled around.
1495908	1496429	It doesn't have a date.
1496449	1497229	I think it's eventually.
1498530	1500012	So, like, when Advent Children comes out?
1500092	1500832	Like, around that same time?
1500852	1501453	Around the same time.
1501973	1502694	No, no.
1502714	1504035	You know, that's the same time we get the PS3.
1504055	1505296	Advent Children is in April.
1505556	1506356	Before the apocalypse.
1506657	1507217	Okay, that's good.
1507938	1509699	Well, obviously before Christmas, right?
1509799	1510940	It's got to come out before Christmas.
1511901	1512261	Exactly.
1512911	1513712	We know at least that.
1513852	1514773	But Christmas, what year?
1515273	1515994	What decade?
1516134	1516434	Shut up.
1517035	1518857	All right, let's move on to another story.
1518977	1524642	Loki, another very popular franchise would be, well, anything made by Miyamoto.
1524702	1525783	So what's Miyamoto getting?
1526183	1528465	He's getting knighted by the French.
1529226	1531648	I'm not sure if that's more of a compliment or a...
1533485	1534305	Hey, now watch it.
1534325	1535405	We might have listeners in France.
1535465	1535786	Be careful.
1557799	1562821	He's like wearing some one-up shirt and he has the Zelda sword and shield.
1562841	1566242	He just looks like a dumbass, but it's hilarious.
1566822	1568322	He's just so happy and childish.
1570223	1571163	I love Kojima, though.
1571183	1573084	Or not Kojima, Miyamoto.
1573104	1574344	Sorry, I was thinking of another upcoming story.
1574744	1578986	I love Miyamoto, though, because he's always so animated, like whenever you see him.
1579646	1580766	I bumped into him at E3.
1581186	1581466	Really?
1581946	1582427	That's awesome.
1582867	1583487	And you survived?
1583827	1585087	Yes, and I survived.
1585608	1586708	You didn't fall down?
1588004	1591225	I bumped into Kojima too, the year before I've been touched by fame I'm a Silent Hill
1604950	1607591	We were doing an interview that never recorded.
1607732	1610033	Don't remind me about the lost interview at Konami booth.
1610374	1612695	Anyway, let's move on to another story.
1613496	1618079	Let's go over to DarkSakura, who has a story about the Nintendo DS.
1618880	1620221	There's a little program out.
1620341	1627206	It's a freeware called Pointy Remote, where you can use your DS to control your computer.
1628953	1630274	I personally haven't tried it.
1630294	1632596	I'm not about to go opening up my DS or anything.
1633197	1639021	But it lets you use the touchpad to select icons to zoom in.
1640762	1647667	There's actually on oneemulation.com there's a thread actually going on about it for anyone who wants to check it out.
1649308	1650249	But it's
1651147	1653809	It looks like it's still very experimental.
1653909	1655471	They're still working on it.
1655711	1656451	It looks cool.
1656491	1657272	It's a neat idea.
1657933	1661375	I honestly don't think that I would ever bother doing anything like that with my DS.
1663437	1664918	I don't think you have to open it up, though.
1667480	1671343	All you'd have to do is just reflash it, I guess.
1672024	1673625	I don't feel like doing anything to my DS.
1673645	1675006	I'm still busy playing Animal Crossing.
1676027	1679530	Yes, my DS is a holy object that cannot be violated by the hands of man.
1682974	1686577	It actually will be using the Wi-Fi.
1686897	1691801	So you could actually, in theory, take it out and use it elsewhere.
1692561	1693482	So it's a good idea.
1693742	1695043	It's a neat idea.
1695844	1699126	But I don't think I would do anything with it.
1699706	1701488	They should, though, have a similar device, though.
1701528	1702869	I think they could make a lot of money with that.
1704370	1704610	All right.
1706128	1711052	Moving on, let's go over to Loki for some updates regarding Midway.
1712133	1714374	Some news on the newest Mortal Kombat, hopefully?
1714535	1714995	Midway.
1715675	1719759	Got some news actually for Midway, Namco, and Ubisoft, so it should be good.
1719779	1722621	The first, of course, is coming from Midway's Gamer Day.
1723822	1727025	I was unaware that everyone had their own Gamer Day, but I guess they do.
1727545	1731549	Anyways, some of the titles that they've announced, they're coming out this year.
1731929	1733050	The first one being...
1733570	1734171	MLB Slugfest 2006
1756938	1760341	which is going to be actually a budget game coming out in about 20 bucks.
1760781	1763022	So that's pretty cool for PlayStation 2 and Xbox.
1763923	1776471	And of course, they have some info on the new Mortal Kombat Armageddon which is basically going to contain every single Mortal Kombat character in the Mortal Kombat universe plus a creative fighter and creative fatality mode.
1777172	1778753	It just looks really cool.
1779574	1797645	and then for your PSP fans they of course have Mortal Kombat Unchained or Mortal Kombat Deception Unchained which is kind of an update to the original Deception game of course with bonus characters including Katana, Jax, Frost, Blaze, Goro and Shao Kahn as well.
1798805	1799626	So that's pretty sweet.
1800426	1807531	And then of course if you're an NBA fan NBA Ballers Phenom which also goes with NBA Ballers Rebound for the PSP.
1807651	1808191	Those kind of
1808789	1810390	A different take on the basketball games.
1810710	1813511	Basically, you have to kind of become a star in a week.
1813631	1819433	So you get noticed by both sports agents and talent agents.
1819573	1824335	And what's kind of funny is they had one mini game in this that's kind of like DDR.
1824355	1826036	You're dancing with mascots.
1827131	1827912	Rampage Total Destructions
1847373	1847934	on top of that.
1847974	1854983	Plus, it includes the original Rampage game and Rampage World Tour that came out on PlayStation 2 a while back.
1855243	1857466	Not a big fan of any Rampage games since the original MSA.
1857486	1858687	It's also under $20.
1862032	1864835	If you're not a huge fan of it, at least it's not that expensive.
1864855	1866217	Maybe a rental.
1866952	1867352	Exactly.
1867392	1874799	And of course, their big title for this year is going to be The Spy Hunter, No Where to Run, of course, featuring The Rock and with the movie coming out.
1874839	1875500	Isn't that risky?
1875560	1880424	Because I don't see that movie doing very well, but of course, now that I said that, it'll probably be huge.
1881125	1882746	It's going to be a good action movie, put it that way.
1882967	1884248	I mean, Doom did pretty well.
1884888	1885269	It did?
1885829	1886430	It did okay.
1886890	1887150	Okay.
1887190	1888111	It's going to do better.
1888131	1890473	Well, it certainly did better than House of the Dead.
1890774	1892335	Let's leave it that way.
1893176	1893356	Okay.
1893376	1893456	Yeah.
1894954	1898876	Strangehold, a third-person kung fu cinematic game
1911304	1912205	which is kind of interesting.
1912665	1916529	Now, all done with Midway here, let's move on to Ubisoft.
1916589	1919911	Ubisoft is going to have a ton of stuff coming out in the Tom Clancy series.
1920612	1934744	First being Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas which is coming out on both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and The Revolution as well as PC and PSP and probably current gen stuff as well, I'm assuming.
1935745	1938947	Of course, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon 4
1940263	1940584	Firehawk
1953823	1956465	I've never really heard of Firehawks, so that should be interesting.
1957045	1960007	Assassin, coming out also on all the next-gen systems.
1961288	1963509	One that I was really excited about, Luminous 2.
1963989	1966031	Hooray, me too, very excited.
1966051	1967231	PSP and PlayStation 2.
1967852	1969513	Yeah, thank you.
1969753	1971054	So that's pretty awesome.
1971994	1972655	Big kisses.
1973655	1975156	And then a couple other things.
1975556	1981200	There's Rayman 4 coming out on the next-gen systems and PlayStation 2 and handhelds.
1982177	1987123	and the new Might and Magic game, Dark Messiah of Might and Magic on the next-gen systems and PC.
1988524	1991828	Dear Luminous Creators, online versus K-Thanks.
1993804	1996165	Finally, Namco's lineup, which is pretty sweet.
1996685	2001288	We've got actually next month Ace Combat Zero coming out if you're an Ace Combat fan.
2002028	2004949	Me and my Katamari coming out later this year, which is pretty sweet.
2005850	2010012	Snoopy and the Red Baron coming out fall of this year, which is going to be pretty cool.
2010572	2016074	The only next-gen game they had coming out this year is Frame City Killer, and that's been delayed numerous times.
2016194	2019976	I think it's now slated for around July, which is interesting.
2019996	2021337	And of course, Pac-Man fans...
2022247	2023527	Pac-Man World Rally Warhammer Mark of Chaos
2044685	2046466	Lots and lots of goodies coming out this year.
2047706	2053008	We're now in that period of the year, especially building up to E3, where we're going to hear a lot of flood of just game announcements.
2053408	2056470	And I got another one for you guys, and this is kind of a duh.
2056830	2062932	I mean, we all knew this was coming, but Guitar Hero 2 has been for all purposes confirmed.
2063512	2070175	Kelly Sumner, who's the CEO of Red Octane, has said, We are working on Guitar Hero 2, which will have 40 plus new tracks.
2070635	2071055	Yay!
2071095	2072696	I think a lot of us were waiting for that.
2072776	2073796	Sounds like it's going to be awesome.
2073816	2076097	But here's the part that's kind of interesting.
2076637	2085921	He also says that there's going to be genre spin-offs like country rock, metal edition, and possibly even doing a plug-and-play.
2086021	2087381	Like, you know how they have those joysticks?
2087401	2089002	Well, what if you just bought a guitar?
2089122	2089942	No PlayStation needed.
2090262	2091743	Plug a guitar right into the TV.
2092523	2097745	That worries me a little bit because now I'm going, uh-oh, is this too much of a good thing?
2098225	2099886	Can oversaturation destroy...
2100970	2102131	Guitar Hero, what do you think?
2103452	2103912	Maybe.
2104273	2105233	Depends on how they do it.
2105293	2114601	If they do it like, if it's exactly like Guitar Hero, you know, just as good, then maybe it might work, but no.
2115601	2116442	I'm kind of worried about that.
2116622	2123988	It's kind of too bad for Red Octane that Guitar Hero wasn't an Xbox title because then they could be doing these expansions through live.
2125309	2125509	But,
2126926	2132070	I guess PlayStation 2 doesn't really allow that same type of thing, so I guess this is what they have to do.
2132670	2139455	Of course, have we ever really had games here that use the append idea like they did in Japan with some of the Beat Manias, where you have appendists?
2139635	2142778	Well, there's something that they can do, and this is kind of a brand new thing.
2142798	2145220	They did it with SOCOM, with downloadable maps.
2145740	2151945	You pay a fee online, I believe it's $5, and you download the maps to a USB card.
2152455	2165102	And if you have a USB memory card or something like that, then you plug that into your PlayStation 2 and it unlocks the maps and it downloads to the hard drive type thing.
2165483	2169585	Of course, that's a lot of factors that don't really bode well.
2169645	2171926	I mean, the PS2 Slim doesn't have a hard drive.
2172467	2174668	Not everyone has a USB memory stick.
2174728	2178730	Not everyone's willing to pay for this and download it off the internet type thing.
2178810	2180111	So, I don't know.
2181068	2188316	Comments from the chatroom, www.orangeloungeradio.com We have Wolfwind Shadow says, do an 80s version on Guitar Hero.
2188756	2189076	Winner.
2189557	2191959	It'll be like hair rock power ballads.
2192400	2193561	This guy just won the internet.
2193581	2194281	That's a great idea.
2194822	2197164	I would love to see early 90s music as well, though.
2197244	2200948	I want my Nelson, my Poison, my damn Yankees.
2201248	2202630	Motley Crue, Tesla.
2203860	2205082	That would be awesome.
2205783	2206784	Let's just do Guitar Hero.
2206804	2211410	I just need Guitar Hero Ted Nugent for Guitar Hero Queen.
2212471	2212992	Heck yeah.
2213152	2213853	All Queen.
2214094	2219320	Well, they have one Queen song in the... No, we need a Guitar Hero J-Rock version to go out in Japan.
2220141	2221243	Think we'll ever see Guitar Freaks?
2221954	2222995	DDR Supernova
2243877	2246799	Yep, now they're doing location testing in Japan.
2247820	2254425	And a lot more songs have been added to the location test, including some of our old favorites here.
2254465	2260090	Our new Captain Jack, Centerfold, the 130 BPM Move It remix, which is interesting.
2261611	2264874	They also feature some Doesn't Really Matter by Janet Jackson.
2266315	2266975	Let's see here.
2267396	2271079	Kaimano, Love at First Sight, Twin Master Plan Mix.
2272809	2274631	Some pretty big names there, Janet and Kylie.
2275171	2278254	Yeah, Wookiee Wookiee by Macho Man.
2279274	2282717	Okay, and for every big name there's got to be a what the F is this, alright?
2282757	2283438	I thought that was funny.
2284839	2288622	Was it De Capo by Ace of Base?
2290323	2291284	De Capo, I think it is.
2291304	2292185	De Capo, I'm sorry.
2292265	2292425	Yeah.
2293185	2294166	Golden Sky by SmileDK.
2294226	2294426	Okay.
2296297	2299079	Return of Small Decay My Only Shining Star by Naoki featuring Becky Lucinda
2320769	2323031	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2348976	2355899	Shouting the lyrics to the song, and it's exactly like your D2R, really for you type things.
2357340	2357981	I didn't like it.
2358241	2360702	I listened to the song once, and I'm like, no.
2361262	2363383	Naoki fans will be fine with it.
2363763	2366525	It's exactly 1998 or anything like that.
2366565	2370607	If you like that superhero beat stuff, great.
2371633	2373595	D to the A to the N to the C
2398317	2399838	Extra Stages are kind of interesting.
2400318	2409045	On top of Fascination Max, they also have Healing D-Vision by D-Stard, which is interesting.
2409545	2412367	Which I'm sure is just another Naoki pseudonym, honestly.
2412727	2416450	And then the one more Extra Stage is Chaos by Desire Returns.
2417451	2423975	Oh, that'll make people happy, because Desire did Trip Machine, and I think it was a big Healing Vision and all that stuff, right?
2423995	2424335	So that'll be fun.
2424355	2424496	Exactly.
2425976	2430461	So I'm happy to hear a new Healing Vision song and Chaos sounds good.
2432492	2434193	Fascination Max sucks so bad.
2434213	2435173	Why?
2435253	2436954	Well, at least they're giving you options now.
2436974	2437934	You don't have to play that one.
2438034	2439575	But it sucks so bad.
2439695	2443176	Anyways, I thought that was interesting.
2443376	2448958	Well, we know that we have a lot of fans out there who grew up with us on the music games, but of course we talk about all the games.
2448978	2452700	We want to open up the floor right now for your feedback, and you can give us a call.
2453280	2454741	We're on the Skype line right now.
2454861	2458302	Username is Orange Lounge Radio, or you can actually pick up the phone and call us, 916-226-9067.
2458402	2459222	But here's the thing.
2461303	2462604	Orange Lounge Radio Orange Lounge Radio
2482697	2486319	Nintendo Maniac 64 Hello Nintendo Maniac 64, what's on your mind?
2487159	2490461	Um, I want to give a shout out to uh Shout out!
2491402	2491722	To who?
2492522	2494103	Carissa Gregory Okay, why?
2494904	2506070	Um, because I hope she's listening in because like I referred her to the show here and I just hope she's listening in Is this a special friend?
2507250	2510492	No, just a friend in general Okay, just, you know, I had to check
2511049	2511950	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2536752	2539174	Well, you guys are talking about, like, cars with guns and things like that.
2539374	2539635	Uh-huh.
2540415	2544879	Like, if you want a game with cars with guns, like, play Battle Mode and Rush 2049.
2546521	2548062	I haven't played it, maybe.
2548102	2551305	What makes this game so great compared to Burnout and Full Auto and all that stuff?
2551986	2558952	Basically, think Mario Kart Battle Mode, except you actually have guns mounted on top of your cars, and you literally are shooting each other and blowing each other up.
2558992	2560193	Well, that sounds like Full Auto to me.
2561641	2561921	Really?
2562261	2565342	Yeah, Full Auto's pretty much the same thing, except you get mines and all that fun stuff, too.
2565382	2566662	Wait, he's saying Rush 2049?
2566702	2567942	I thought they didn't have guns in it.
2568222	2569502	Well, he said Battle Edition.
2569882	2570002	Oh.
2570483	2571103	No, Battle Mode.
2571363	2571883	Battle Mode.
2572823	2574643	Same game, just different mode.
2574743	2579924	Well, obviously, this is a very popular genre of games, as cars with guns and destruction is fun.
2580464	2590326	And I'm all for it, because honestly, if I can take out my aggressions on the Xbox and I don't do it for real when I see those old ladies driving the SUVs that can't stay in one lane and all that fun stuff...
2591280	2591880	DarkSakura.com
2615785	2616908	You're so awful!
2617549	2618331	Alright, just messing.
2618832	2622440	Nintendo Maniac, any other feedback, hellos you want to say before we let you go?
2624685	2625807	I'm not really sure if my MP...
2631735	2634776	MP3 Pro will only work in Winamp, it doesn't work in iTunes, unfortunately.
2634876	2638977	I know, I'm using Winamp.
2640818	2645680	You're not going to hear too much of a difference this time at the 64K, it's really good either way.
2646520	2651042	But if you have it installed and you have it selected and ready to go, you should be set.
2651782	2652002	Okay.
2652250	2653030	Alright, have a good one.
2653590	2654691	Can I have one last question?
2654711	2654971	Sure.
2655651	2658172	Okay, does it affect regular MP3s too?
2659412	2662873	No, not unless you purposely save your MP3s as MP3 Pro.
2662953	2669395	Some programs like Adobe Audition will allow you to encode an MP3 Pro right away, but you're probably not going to notice much of a difference.
2670056	2670296	Okay.
2670516	2670776	Alright.
2672016	2672596	Have a good one, buddy.
2672997	2673557	Thanks for calling.
2674817	2678098	Alright, let's go to another call here on the Skype line.
2678938	2680579	Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
2681735	2682035	Hello!
2682456	2683016	Hi, who's this?
2683756	2684837	This is Wolf Windshadow.
2684977	2685978	Hello, Wolf Windshadow!
2686018	2687860	Oh, you're the one that wanted the 80s Guitar Hero.
2688960	2690682	Oh, yeah, I grew up in the 80s.
2691462	2695145	We did, too, and we were just talking about how old we feel tonight, but that's all right.
2695485	2696005	You know what?
2696086	2700569	We need an old-school Aerosmith loving an elevator.
2700649	2702030	How fun would that be on Guitar Hero?
2702350	2704392	Well, what's on your mind tonight?
2706133	2707174	Oh, not too much.
2707394	2710156	Just run into your show for the first time.
2710879	2711700	Awesome, how'd you find us?
2713140	2717703	I was just randomly searching for places that use Skype.
2718403	2718904	Oh, wow.
2719244	2719944	Okay, that's cool.
2720164	2720525	Awesome.
2720625	2721705	That's pretty unique.
2721845	2739496	You know, I'm going to say, we were, and I'm going to make a claim here, and somebody will probably dispute that, but we were honestly one of the first online radio stations to back Skype instead of a Skype line, because we've been doing Skype for a long, long time, and now it's really catching on, but, you know, we're happy to have pioneered the Skype line thing.
2740876	2742797	Oh yeah, I'm a computer consultant.
2742837	2744797	I have it up on my website.
2745257	2745517	Awesome.
2745817	2746658	Well, you sound great.
2746698	2750919	I should have guessed you were a former Skype user because sometimes we have first-timers on Skype that don't sound so great.
2751259	2755260	But we're really glad that we got random people connecting to our show.
2755800	2757100	What kind of games have you been playing this week?
2758781	2760241	Actually, not too many this week.
2760321	2765702	I'm getting ready to go back to school and finish up my degree.
2765842	2768043	Real life's got to come first sometimes, right, DarkSakura?
2768063	2768383	Yeah.
2769232	2769953	Sadly, yes.
2770974	2773736	Sometimes you have to cut classes how to accommodate life.
2773856	2777259	Okay, well, if you didn't have to be going back to school, what game would you be checking out right now?
2778640	2781322	Actually, I'd be checking out some of the games with cars and guns.
2781543	2782063	There you go.
2782924	2785106	It's a big thing right now.
2785306	2787308	Are you a burnout man or a full auto man?
2788829	2789349	Full auto.
2789970	2790711	Any particular reason why?
2791872	2794013	Not really, just interesting.
2794274	2796576	Because you actually get guns on your car in full auto, huh?
2797516	2798177	Probably something like that.
2798677	2801019	Well, Wolf, Wind, Shadow, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
2801800	2802660	Oh, not tonight.
2802980	2804361	I'm actually enjoying the show.
2804602	2805262	Thank you very much.
2805302	2805843	We appreciate it.
2805883	2806883	We love getting new listeners.
2807004	2808625	So, you know, tell a friend.
2808645	2810967	Help support independent online radio.
2811027	2811387	We love it.
2811627	2812067	Give us money.
2812107	2812528	Yeah.
2813208	2814349	We're not asking for money yet.
2815830	2816090	All right.
2816110	2817612	Thanks so much, Wolf, Wind, Shadow, for tuning in.
2817892	2818272	Take care.
2818372	2818993	And you know what?
2819233	2821995	Write Red Octane and tell them your idea for the 80s Guitar Hero.
2822115	2822796	I think it should happen.
2823736	2824137	Oh, yeah.
2824237	2824537	All right.
2825037	2825538	Take care, buddy.
2825558	2825938	Have a good one.
2828021	2830302	Alright, let's go to another call here.
2830402	2832123	Let's go, we'll pick up this line.
2833084	2834165	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
2836866	2840408	Hi, turn down your speakers because we're hearing ourselves pretty bad.
2841069	2842029	Sure.
2843730	2844250	We got time.
2845691	2846392	Okay, what's on your mind?
2848293	2848793	Is it good now?
2849393	2850014	I think we're okay.
2850054	2850534	What's on your mind?
2851415	2857178	Alright, I kind of joined in a bit late, but I heard Loki talking about a song that he just hated.
2857523	2858223	What song was that?
2858383	2860164	Because I know it's on the new mix.
2860285	2861485	What song was he talking about?
2861645	2863666	Fascination Max, right, Loki?
2865027	2867048	Are you just trying to get me to hate you?
2867108	2868229	I mean, I'm a Mac user.
2868409	2869650	I love Fascination Max.
2869670	2870930	Are you just trying to get me to hate you?
2872671	2874732	He's a Mac user and he loves Fascination Max.
2874752	2876213	He's just the anti-Loki.
2877014	2879155	Got bad taste in music and computing.
2882485	2887368	Well, I can tell you right now that Loki does not blow up in the presence of Max because there's one pointing directly at him.
2889609	2891870	There's one redeeming quality, the PSP homebrew.
2892351	2892791	That's good.
2893792	2896813	You know, diversity makes the world go round, my friend.
2896873	2898855	Sometimes we're just going to have to agree to disagree.
2899435	2902537	I think when Loki goes to hell, it's going to be like an Apple store.
2905399	2906940	Flat panel iMacs everywhere.
2907160	2907420	All right.
2908317	2909198	I just thought of this.
2909238	2912000	Do you think they're going to have a dedication to Captain Jack on Supernova?
2938979	2939439	Ray Charles?
2967839	2968520	Okay, there you go.
2968600	2973004	Ray Charles is in DDR and there was no real... Wait, Ray Charles?
2973144	2973905	Is he still alive?
2973945	2974165	No.
2974786	2976527	He died last year.
2977488	2979911	Can you see how much I follow the entertainment news?
2981132	2983033	SSJ, really, only time will tell.
2983054	2984014	17 years of this crap.
2984755	2985296	No idea.
2985536	2985936	No idea.
2986297	2987037	It would be nice.
2987498	2989199	What would you do if you were Konami?
2989219	2991762	How would you pay your respects to Captain Jack, who passed away last year?
2992452	3001283	I don't know, probably have a little picture before the pre-game animation saying, this is dedicated to Captain Jack.
3001463	3002425	Kind of like Burnout Revenge.
3003288	3003768	Did they have that?
3003788	3004349	Yeah, like that.
3004849	3005450	Oh, I haven't seen it.
3005470	3006010	You haven't seen it?
3006211	3006351	No.
3006811	3008412	I don't know who the hell it is, though.
3008913	3009293	Interesting.
3009373	3009934	Who is that?
3010214	3011335	Some guy, I don't know.
3011375	3011956	Some doctor.
3012096	3016099	They can show his picture and do R.I.P., you know, birth date, death date.
3016199	3022365	I think if they did something really lovely with the background, I think that would be appropriate, so when people played the song, they could, you know, why are you laughing?
3022525	3026628	They do it like Pixar, where Pixar, at the end of the credits, has babies that were born during the production of the film.
3031411	3033232	They could have people that have died in the production of the game.
3035572	3038793	It's really morbid, but... They could put, you know, Captain Jack, my soul.
3040414	3042954	Alright, SSJ100, Matt, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
3042994	3043715	Our profit margins?
3045955	3046295	Roxer?
3047296	3047936	Nothing really.
3048216	3053518	I managed to actually get a sneak peek of a video game movie that's coming out soon.
3053618	3054058	What's this?
3055378	3056659	It's called Staying Alive.
3057319	3057919	And what's it about?
3059037	3061118	It's not that movie with John Travolta, was it?
3061138	3063838	It's not Staying Alive, it's called... Stay Alive.
3064158	3064778	Oh, Stay Alive.
3065018	3070080	It's the one where the kids play the game and when they die in the game, they die in real life.
3070120	3070600	I saw a trailer.
3070620	3072940	It's not necessarily a video game movie.
3073100	3078462	It's more of a really crappy movie that they based around... It's capitalizing on the violent game culture.
3079182	3079802	You know what it is?
3080002	3080802	What did you think?
3081062	3081542	You saw it.
3081562	3082023	What did you think?
3082563	3083483	Well, actually, no, I didn't really...
3085486	3086166	I didn't really see it.
3086246	3087507	It was at an old school.
3087527	3091268	I went to visit it and I visited the video game section.
3091288	3098731	They were giving them sneak peeks of the gameplay in the movie.
3098951	3103652	The movie itself looks like Nightmare on Elm Street meets Ring.
3105313	3106973	If you die in the game, you die in real life.
3107734	3111655	It's nonsense like that.
3111755	3114356	Is it something that you will probably want to see?
3115256	3115716	Probably not.
3117097	3118578	Isn't that kid from Malcolm in the Middle in it?
3120859	3122540	No, actually, I don't know.
3122620	3125081	But the guy from... I think he is.
3126382	3130404	The guy who was in Hebrew Hammer, I'm not sure if anyone knows that.
3130424	3131224	Oh, Adam Goldberg.
3131785	3132265	Yeah, Goldberg.
3132285	3133165	Damn, you beat me to it.
3134726	3135887	I'm just that good, Bugged.
3136027	3137227	You should know after 17 years.
3138528	3143871	Yeah, but I saw in the trailer, this shouldn't be much of a spoiler because you see it in the trailer, he dies, which means his role isn't that big.
3145325	3146546	Yeah, obviously not.
3147426	3149087	Alright, well we'll see when the movie comes out.
3149287	3150028	Much like Scream.
3150228	3151729	We'll have an OLR at the movie day.
3152209	3154330	Alright, SSJ1Hermat, thank you so much for calling.
3154630	3155751	Appreciate it as always, bud.
3156051	3156251	You too.
3157935	3158375	DarkSakura DarkSakura
3181778	3190346	Nope, there's going to be no online mode for Virtua Fighter, which actually I don't really care about Virtua Fighter, but I just thought it was pretty funny that they were even trying.
3190787	3193089	Hiroshi Kataoka, who was the...
3194358	3205522	I guess big guy behind Virtua Fighter told EGM basically that they tried to do it online by simulating lag and timing and that it wasn't really going to do that.
3205562	3207242	It changed the gameplay way too much.
3208082	3212664	To quote, if we ever wanted to do an online fighting game, it would have to be something besides Virtua Fighter.
3213284	3218886	So maybe that's a hint at something else, but for right now, no online mode.
3219646	3219766	Awww.
3221463	3225184	I don't know many people that are Virtua Fighter fans above all else.
3225765	3231287	I know people that like Virtua Fighter, but they also like Dead or Alive or something.
3231347	3232327	Mortal Kombat.
3232807	3237609	I know plenty of people who are diehard Virtua Fighter fans who have been since day one.
3238349	3242671	My bias against Virtua Fighter starts from day one because the game gave me massive headaches.
3243647	3247329	and so I just never got into playing it too much and then I found my love for Tekken.
3247529	3250950	I was going to say, can you actually be a fan of both Virtua Fighter and Tekken?
3250970	3251470	I'm not sure.
3251490	3252651	Well, I'm sure you could.
3252671	3258093	I mean, I'm not, but anyone can, it just depends on what you like.
3258213	3260694	I don't see why you have to hate one thing to like the other.
3260714	3264516	Well, wasn't Virtua Fighter kind of the response to Tekken?
3266016	3269358	Actually, Virtua Fighter was out, if I do recall, before Tekken.
3269478	3270158	Oh, well, I don't know.
3270178	3270538	I don't know.
3271087	3271587	Virtua Fighter 32X
3298686	3298946	Wow.
3299126	3300107	Oh, I think it was.
3300127	3303868	Virtua Racing had the humongous Genesis cartridge.
3304388	3307009	No, Virtua Fighter was on Genesis, if I do recall.
3307649	3308029	Really?
3308530	3310450	Let me do a quick bit of research.
3310470	3312511	I think it was either on Genesis or 32X.
3312611	3315252	I think they put out a crap version on Genesis is what it is.
3315272	3316153	Yeah, it was really awful.
3316273	3316933	Yeah, it was really awful.
3316953	3320074	And Tekken didn't make it to the home until PlayStation was out.
3320094	3323515	So it still has a promo pack for my Saturn that has Virtua Fighter 2?
3323675	3328057	Virtua Fighter 2 was one of the pack-in games.
3328530	3332091	Right, with Daytona and something else I forgot that I don't play.
3332111	3332431	Christmas Nights?
3332591	3334752	No, Christmas Nights was a mail-in thing.
3335492	3342274	Dark Knight in our chatroom says, Saturn first, then 32X, then Genesis, but they're kind of going back and forth a little bit.
3342294	3344514	No, because the 32X version was out before the Saturn was out.
3344614	3349016	They're trying to figure it out right now in chat, so, I mean, honestly, it's not a big deal.
3349296	3351356	No, because I had a 32X.
3351656	3355918	No, well, I would trade back and forth my Nintendo and 32X with somebody, and he had Virtual Fighter on 32X.
3355938	3355998	Hmm.
3357628	3364611	I mean, I have the game now on 32X, but... Zaku in our chatroom, Legend of Zaku, says 32X is the worst add-on ever.
3364651	3365071	Would you agree?
3365851	3370052	No, because of Knuckles Chaotix and Calibri.
3370092	3373054	I think you can play Knuckles Chaotix on a GameTap, I want to say.
3373854	3385318	I like Knuckles Chaotix, because who remembers... If anyone is into emulation, there was a game called Sonic Crackers, which, from what I understand, was the template for what Knuckles Chaotix became.
3385748	3388270	Colibri was a really cool game we played as a little hummingbird.
3389470	3390031	Oh, I played that.
3390051	3399977	And the best home version of Space Harrier, apart from the re-releases, was on 32X and Afterburner.
3400858	3402259	I played Colibri on GameTap.
3402279	3403400	It made no sense to me at all.
3403620	3405321	It's a freaky little weird game, but it's cool.
3406061	3410224	But no, the best versions of Space Harrier and Afterburner were on 32X.
3411165	3411405	All right.
3412488	3414029	Let's move on to another topic.
3414149	3416050	I'm going to talk about the Xbox 360.
3416150	3417651	Moving on to a new platform.
3418711	3425675	If you have a 360 but somehow haven't bought Xbox Live Gold, you're going to get your chance to sample what it's all about.
3425735	3428677	It's coming up at the end of the month, March 31st through April 2nd.
3429777	3433659	Only in the US though, sorry listeners in UK, Japan, etc.
3434179	3436040	Verizon is going to be sponsoring this.
3436360	3443523	They're going to be giving Xbox Live Gold to everybody for the weekend and also giving away 1 million points.
3443863	3448425	Not all at once, but you can collect your 500 free Microsoft points.
3448985	3449826	Not sure how.
3450186	3455488	I imagine it's going to involve selling your soul to Verizon in one way or another, but we'll see.
3455628	3456589	It's an April Fool's joke.
3456629	3457169	Look at the dates.
3457771	3458912	March 31st to April 2nd.
3458952	3459732	No, I don't know.
3459792	3460272	It's right in the middle.
3460572	3462493	But they're advertising it on Xbox Live right now.
3462533	3464254	So I don't think it's an April Fool's joke.
3464354	3464774	The points are.
3465094	3465254	Right.
3465655	3467515	But they're also going to have some tournaments.
3467575	3469976	And I know one of them was for Geometry Wars, which I think is kind of neat.
3470157	3471117	So that's pretty cool.
3472134	3472994	It's interesting.
3473034	3478899	I mean, sure, it's corporate, but it's nice to see something different happening and some little promotions going on.
3478939	3479620	I mean, it's kind of cool.
3479900	3486225	Also, if you happen to purchase a copy of Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, you get 48 hours of free Xbox Live Gold.
3486405	3487646	There's a card in there, too.
3488066	3494812	But most likely, if you bought that game, you probably already have Xbox Live Gold anyways, because it's
3495194	3496775	Virtua Fighter Saturn, June 95, Virtua Fighter 32X, November 95
3516511	3517451	I'll settle this right now.
3517471	3518752	Street Fighter is greater than everything.
3546869	3547850	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3569224	3570605	What's Nintendo cooking up, Loki?
3570805	3573366	They're cooking up a new game here for the revolution, and this is actually a
3593868	3594329	Thanks for watching!
3609170	3609510	Cool.
3609851	3611192	That's the good kind of scare for me.
3611593	3617218	So kind of like, you know, think Silent Hill to an extent, you know, because I know Silent Hill is pretty bloody.
3617278	3622303	But, you know, definitely things like, for example, they'll use the Revolution Controller.
3622363	3627008	You can use it as a torch to scare away rats or to slit the throat of...
3627489	3628530	That's not gory at all
3648416	3649817	That actually was done.
3676943	3677544	Eternal Darkness
3688854	3689414	Mario Parties
3717056	3721740	There's really not anything killer coming out for the GameCube.
3721760	3726705	The only other thing lined up for it is the next Zelda Twilight Princess.
3726985	3727545	That's it.
3728646	3729107	That's it.
3729407	3730147	Don't get me wrong.
3730408	3735512	I love me some Nintendo, but I think the GameCube is slowly fading to black, which is sad.
3737205	3740726	Anyway, let's go on to another story.
3740746	3746688	If you play one too many of these survival horror games, you might just start going crazy and have to go into a recovery program.
3747248	3752350	But anyway, the gaming industry, there's been a suggestion on the internet lately for a recovery program of its own.
3752370	3753050	Correct, DarkSakura?
3753930	3761993	There was actually, I brought up a 12-step self-esteem recovery program at the game marketing conference.
3762355	3764776	Now this isn't for gamers though, it's for the gaming industry.
3764796	3766197	The gaming industry, exactly.
3766217	3769959	Because the gaming industry has been kind of one-two punched by the government a lot lately.
3770039	3773321	So number one, promote the rating system.
3773801	3780085	Basically, there's a good rating system by the ESRB, so make sure people know how it works.
3780525	3782286	Well deserving of being the number one spot.
3783086	3785968	Two, evangelize the benefits of video games.
3787769	3790951	In fact, it actually references a book, Everything Bad is Good for You.
3791818	3795787	But mom, it helps my hand-eye coordination!
3803678	3804539	Vaguely.
3805099	3821047	Well, just to go ahead and read this out, video games involve data pattern recognition and tracking multiple characters and multiple storylines, sustained concentration, complex problem solving, they're interactive, they're not passive like music or reading, there's more open-ended gameplay.
3822768	3832954	Also, especially with puzzle games, that article that I had brought up last year was saying how those who played more video games had overall better problem solving skills than non-gamers.
3833484	3834404	out of their control group.
3836225	3843888	Number three, do more quantitative research with leading universities to prove the positive impact of video gaming and qualify any negatives.
3844148	3845829	They need to share the good and the bad.
3847763	3851226	4.
3847823	3851226	Publicize that history shows we never embrace new media.
3853569	3858634	This is true for silent movies, radio, pulp magazines, comic books, and every new music wave, including Mozart.
3858994	3863338	Video games are not the devil incarnate and not capable of half the devil tree our critics claim for them.
3864299	3866020	That's a quote from there, by the way.
3867841	3870281	Number five, preach moderation and promote good parenting.
3870321	3874563	Remind parents moderation in all things, including video games, is important.
3874603	3876544	You're responsible as parents to oversee this.
3876784	3877264	Amen!
3878144	3878425	Sorry.
3878665	3879725	What site is this coming from?
3881026	3886248	This is actually from Next Generation.
3886768	3887048	Cool.
3887788	3888849	Yeah, this is pretty cool.
3888869	3889449	This is pretty smart.
3889669	3889789	Yep.
3890901	3895383	Six, benchmark against sex and violence in Prime Network TV and movies.
3895763	3898204	I don't think video games have cornered the market on sex and violence.
3898424	3898884	Amen.
3899905	3903286	I think it's funny that they showed a slide of David Hasselhoff in a Speedo.
3903846	3911109	Are they suggesting that the gaming industry run essentially like a political ad smear campaign would be?
3911549	3915371	Try to run a campaign that says games are not as evil as movies?
3915951	3917011	That's kind of how I read that.
3917171	3918532	Well, keep in mind that
3919715	3925624	Watching the news, how many violent acts do you see or hear about just watching the news?
3925664	3928850	True, but the politicians are trying to say that's all because of games.
3931264	3933185	Again, the facts are there.
3933305	3936207	Crime among youth has been in decline.
3937508	3938288	You don't believe me?
3938408	3939649	Ask the Department of Justice.
3940189	3940929	The numbers are there.
3943351	3945252	Seven, embrace the Constitution.
3945312	3949674	We have a right in this industry to make and market our product in an unregulated manner.
3950154	3952095	We should be talking about what our rights are.
3952175	3955697	Video games are part art and part commerce.
3956138	3957558	Both parts are protected.
3958699	3959299	Eight, lobby.
3959479	3960420	Make political donations.
3962675	3964537	Thank you for watching!
3975262	3977403	9.
3975282	3977403	Harness our best spokespeople.
3977443	3979023	Have them talk about why they like video games.
4003644	4015512	have basically using high profile celebrities benefits just to bring different people in by saying their favorite stars say, oh, I like this game.
4015772	4021055	Sadly enough, I don't want to mention this because I really hate the idea anyways, but you have the Hip Hop Gaming League.
4022016	4025278	I mean, most people, I wouldn't see them as really...
4026357	4028819	Number 10 was demonstrate the most creative games.
4028839	4035464	Halo and Grand Theft Auto represent us in the marketplace, but we need to show people it's not all about guns and boobs.
4053410	4059194	Katamari Namashi, DDR, Parappa, Donkey Konga, and Guitar Heroes are all games the whole family can enjoy and play.
4060374	4064157	But a little guitar, or I'm sorry, a little guitar, a little violence and boobs never hurt anyone.
4064437	4064557	No.
4065077	4066218	I still think we need air guitar freaks.
4066278	4066438	Over 18.
4066558	4067779	Hooray for boobies.
4069019	4069700	That was a good album.
4071301	4072001	It was Bloodhound Gang.
4072862	4075503	I'm not that retarded when it comes to pop culture anyway.
4076364	4075503	11.
4076684	4083048	But the problem in statistical perspective, less than 20% of all games released are M-rated, a minority of the product.
4083891	4084311	Good point.
4084731	4085152	Amen.
4086112	4085152	12.
4086252	4086712	Be proud.
4086772	4088253	Don't be ashamed to say you like video games.
4088273	4089834	Just be sure to tell people why you like them.
4092675	4094156	I don't like them.
4094196	4095637	I run into this all the time at work.
4096197	4101920	I'll tell people that, yeah, I do this thing on the internet about video games, and they're kind of like, oh, really?
4102320	4105582	Like, oh, you're like that, huh?
4105602	4105822	I'm
4108314	4108994	You know what's weird?
4109174	4112695	I get more of a reaction from telling someone I'm a gamer than telling them I'm gay.
4113535	4114415	Honestly, I do.
4115396	4118716	I tell somebody at work I'm gay and they go, oh, okay, yeah, we all knew that.
4119056	4123217	And then I tell somebody that I'm a gamer, they're like, oh, wow, you play games?
4125338	4125838	Crazy, crazy.
4125858	4126178	Weird, huh?
4127178	4127718	It's the culture.
4129159	4130299	I am a proud gamer.
4130579	4130979	Amen.
4132299	4133960	And you know what?
4134020	4135040	There should be a number 13 on there.
4136528	4139771	If you're female, tell the boys to piss off if they say you can't play a video game.
4139791	4140292	There you go.
4141453	4142494	Or just beat them to shit.
4142674	4143015	Yeah.
4143455	4146238	You take those platform boots and knock them upside the head.
4147079	4147800	You heard that from me.
4148340	4148701	All right.
4149181	4150963	Let's go.
4150983	4151744	That was a very good top 12.
4152405	4153726	Next Generations I came from?
4154387	4154567	Yeah.
4154647	4155989	I tipped my hat to that website.
4156029	4156329	Very nice.
4156389	4158231	I think it's next-gen.com.
4158691	4158972	Very cool.
4160154	4161094	I've got a story here.
4161214	4164855	We're trying to wrap up this first half of the show here, but plenty more stories to come here.
4165175	4167376	I want to talk about GameTap real quick.
4167776	4173758	GameTap is now going to be offering previews and trailers on their service.
4174158	4176238	It's kind of like a try before you buy type thing.
4177799	4182240	But they recently signed an agreement with Strategy First, who made Galactic Civilizations, and
4183061	4187762	This will allow customers to preview full versions of their pre-release titles.
4188262	4197865	Sounds to me a little bit like the Xbox Live model, a little bit like the demos, but a very interesting way for the PC publishers and GameTap to find that harmony.
4198305	4201006	Hey, I'm all for easy access to game demos.
4201146	4204267	I think it's a great idea, so I tip my hat to GameTap as well.
4205147	4206587	Lots of smart people in gaming this week.
4206627	4207728	This is good news.
4208648	4212249	All right, let's go to the next story, which is from Loki.
4213032	4217794	Yes, let's talk a little bit about Xbox and the patch systems.
4218154	4219814	Gotta love the way they patch games.
4220434	4221235	I hate it.
4221375	4230178	I think it's a dumb idea to release games that aren't ready for the market because they have bugs, and they do it knowingly that they have these errors in the games.
4230478	4237020	For example, Dead or Alive 4, there's a mandatory patch that's fixing bugs and adding no new content coming soon.
4237460	4240321	It's also going to help balance some of the characters, but
4240745	4269337	basically the fix the save bug yay that's something great oh guess what you know those demo kiosks out there that you could download the xbox car for burnout guess what it doesn't work it doesn't work at all because it's broken yes that's right um EA has actually said there's at right now there's no official date of the patch but there will be one to fix the 360 kiosk car because it doesn't work very fun um another thing
4271337	4287506	Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter is going to be getting updates soon to add the Southpaw controller configuration and to fix the bugs in their save system that cause your save game to get deleted, just like it did in Full Auto and in Call of Duty 2.
4288647	4294470	My question is, why are they releasing all these games out there if it's constantly...
4295481	4295801	I don't like it.
4295841	4296402	What do you guys think?
4324511	4332133	I definitely don't think that people should be releasing games that are only half-finished, and I don't think patching is the way to fix your game on the back end.
4332173	4340056	But at the same time, I do realize that the occasional error is going to come up that people don't find.
4340716	4344797	People that find loopholes and stuff, and let's say they didn't know about this whole full-auto patching.
4345037	4345217	and so on.
4371752	4372413	I mean, come on.
4372673	4375736	That screams, oh, we didn't test this on a normal TV.
4375796	4378618	We just used our LCD monitors that we have here at work.
4378658	4379840	It looked fine on that.
4380680	4382302	God, that's just lazy.
4382742	4384044	Extremely lazy.
4384084	4385845	And then they have to go back and fix that.
4385945	4387527	It's so stupid.
4388087	4388828	What can we do about it?
4389428	4390109	Vote with your wallet.
4409036	4411157	Still though, I mean, why?
4411458	4414720	A lot of times we don't know that these bugs are there until after you buy the game.
4414760	4419123	It's like, you know, you play all the way through Call of Duty and all of a sudden, oh, my save game's gone.
4419443	4421945	That's a nice bonus feature that wasn't mentioned on the box art.
4422885	4424246	So, I don't know.
4424346	4428069	I like the idea of patching it to fix stuff and maybe add content later on.
4428169	4437835	I don't like it as an excuse to release a game like Call of Duty 2 whose online multiplayer sucks ass because there's so much lag on it and they obviously didn't test it.
4438914	4441175	So, alright.
4442015	4450278	Well, if you have a response to Loki's little rant, you could always send us an email, and that was sent to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
4450298	4451359	We love to hear from you guys.
4452079	4458581	Every week, DarkSakura likes to go into our mailbag and stick her hand in the mailbag and dig out her favorite letters.
4459061	4462883	And that is mailbag with a B, not hag with an H. Mail hag.
4463443	4464883	Is DarkSakura our mail hag?
4465944	4466484	Just teasing.
4467290	4468771	I say that I tease because I love.
4469031	4469992	That disturbs me.
4470132	4471093	Don't give me evil glares.
4471473	4472794	I didn't give you an evil glare.
4472854	4474155	It was a disturbed look.
4474616	4476677	Alright, DarkSakura likes to dig into the mailbag.
4476697	4477818	She's going to do that right now.
4477838	4478539	With a shovel.
4478599	4480020	Are you all sanitized and ready to go?
4480720	4481741	I've got the hazmat suit.
4483563	4487726	Alright, who emailed us this week?
4488186	4488747	Lots of people.
4490288	4490768	Sweet.
4490888	4491649	Attention rocks.
4492677	4496659	Actually, our good buddy Roblay pointed out a few things.
4497539	4504042	That basically, not only is Xbox getting in all over the 360 thing, we now have 360.yahoo.com.
4504783	4506643	We have the Colgate 360.
4507684	4511405	And we have Anderson Cooper 360 on CNN.
4512146	4513546	That is a brilliant observation.
4514407	4515687	We need to launch Orange Launch Radio 360.
4515727	4515908	Ha ha ha!
4520270	4522072	Maybe that can be the name of our fan club.
4522272	4524615	Oh, speaking of fan clubs, can I plug the new Myspace?
4525405	4527967	Yes, as someone didn't do in our LiveJournal community either.
4527987	4528628	Sorry, my bad.
4528828	4529669	We have a new MySpace.
4529709	4530289	It's brand new.
4530349	4531530	It's different from the group.
4531550	4534593	We had a fan that made a group, but now we have an actual user account.
4534613	4537155	We're a band because we want to be rock stars.
4537395	4539317	But you can actually listen to clips from old shows.
4540018	4544341	And you remember Jaime's email from last week where she was pointing out all the good clips from older shows?
4544461	4544662	Yeah.
4544882	4547544	I actually put the Mega Man clip on our MySpace.
4547804	4551728	So that's www.myspace.com slash OrangeloungeRadio.
4552368	4557972	Yes, we know MySpace is where the internet goes to die, but if we can promote ourselves on it, hey, we'll sell our souls to MySpace.
4557992	4564297	I was actually listening to that the other day, and just cracking up, and my husband thought that I had gone nuts.
4565998	4570001	The freaky part about MySpace is Fox is now using it to promote their TV shows.
4570221	4571222	I am not surprised.
4571242	4572282	Which is lame.
4572563	4572863	I mean...
4573680	4575842	Well, they own it, so why not?
4575922	4576823	Well, check it out.
4577723	4581266	MySpace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and add us because we want like a zillion friends.
4581386	4581647	All right.
4582167	4582767	Sorry to interrupt.
4583148	4584989	We got an email from DJ Ratchet.
4586531	4593316	Basically, just to go into it, if we wanted to thank us for reading the email in the last podcast.
4594637	4605302	but also asked a question about Kingdom Hearts 2 which I actually did reply to about the different summons wanting to know if Chicken Little was in the game.
4606002	4609384	Chicken Little has been confirmed as a summon in Kingdom Hearts 2.
4610124	4611004	Just thought I'd let you know.
4613506	4618548	You know what, I actually should be playing more Kingdom Hearts 2 but I have this issue with playing games in Japanese.
4619534	4625018	I can do it, but then reading... I have to sit there with my dictionary and try to translate the kanji and it gives me a headache.
4625118	4626078	She said dick.
4626959	4627239	Hey!
4628460	4629641	Sorry, I had to do that.
4630001	4631162	I say dick all the time.
4632002	4633263	Dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick.
4635525	4637786	Maybe we should just cut that little clip and put that on our MySpace.
4637846	4639807	Alright, moving on.
4639988	4640328	Dick, dick.
4641709	4642229	Dick, dick, dick.
4643630	4645571	Why am I now thinking of that scene in Spaceballs?
4646051	4646432	Asshole.
4646492	4646732	Asshole.
4648465	4649446	Do I have to separate you two?
4650726	4651087	Next up.
4651607	4651947	Okay.
4652587	4657210	We have an email from, and I have to scroll down to see who this is from, Sycoon.
4657330	4658831	Hi.
4660672	4663353	This is about, you know, old school games.
4663393	4669917	He's a big fan of the old school games, like in the gameplay, but lots of people out there are saying graphics over the games.
4670777	4677081	So, I know, it's like they're saying, oh, this game sucks because it doesn't look pretty.
4678035	4678675	That's stupid.
4681176	4681496	Let's see.
4682077	4683737	Case in point, Geometry Wars.
4684378	4685798	It's pretty, too.
4685838	4691681	Geometry Wars is a pretty game, but it's not exactly pushing the 360s hardware to its limits.
4692181	4692941	Radiant Silvergun.
4693021	4694502	Yes, thank you.
4694902	4696082	Radiant Silvergun is awesome.
4697243	4699564	Then again, so is Ikaruga, and that was really graphically pretty.
4700104	4701945	Once in a while, you can still pull up...
4705345	4709809	You could still pull up an old Atari 2600 Classic on GameTap or emulators or whatever you want to use.
4710209	4710969	And they're still fun.
4711050	4712030	Unless it's E.T.
4712050	4712751	because that game sucked.
4713471	4714732	Well, yeah, but they don't have E.T.
4714792	4716634	on GameTap and I don't think they exist.
4716874	4718395	I think Atari's pretty much written E.T.
4718495	4718615	off.
4719096	4719876	I have too.
4720617	4720957	Sucker.
4721177	4721458	Yeah.
4722138	4722599	I didn't buy them.
4723539	4724100	Dios!
4725219	4734623	But just to go ahead and read a paragraph out of this letter, it said, I just want to know why many people now think that graphics are more important to a game than gameplay.
4735083	4746588	I actually played Sonic Adventure with a friend of mine, and he complained about how blocky it looked to him as compared to Half-Life 2 and Halo 2, and he didn't like it just for that reason, although Sonic Adventure still is a great game.
4746848	4748449	Well, he was comparing first version to 2.
4748589	4750430	I mean, Sonic Adventure 2 wasn't as...
4754005	4757266	Sonic Adventure was really smooth, very nice.
4757326	4760668	I can't think of any games on Dreamcast that were blocky at all.
4760948	4763769	No, not since the early PlayStation games.
4763829	4765209	And even then, it's like, who cares?
4765269	4767970	One of my favorite games ever on PlayStation is called Evil Zone.
4768590	4771592	And it's really horrible looking, but it's so cheeseball.
4771612	4774273	We want to make fun of every anime in existence.
4774493	4777874	Well, it's just spoiled by next-gen pretty stuff, you know?
4780576	4791845	I think it's just because we grew up with the we have nothing but gameplay that we have a better appreciation for a game that plays well versus a game that looks pretty and plays like crap.
4792105	4793086	Half-Life 2 plays well.
4796308	4797709	I can't play first person.
4797749	4804254	Halo is a pretty game and it's a good game, don't get me wrong, but don't knock Sonic Adventure just because it's not pristine.
4804761	4805602	Sonic Team Camera
4824341	4832066	In another Dreamcast game, Blue Stinger, I had the Japanese version, where it had the big cinematic camera angles.
4832907	4838810	It's really hard to do that scene where you're climbing up the tower when the camera is like 50 miles above the tower.
4839591	4842513	It's like, oh, yay, I'm going to pretend I know where I'm going.
4844494	4845675	So, next letter, shall I?
4846075	4846295	Sure.
4847076	4847776	Another one from Rob.
4849057	4850978	About Lieberman being the porker of the month.
4852619	4853620	Like, fatty?
4853640	4853720	Yeah.
4854139	4856482	CDC Investigate Video Games Disease Control?
4871025	4878613	This Katamari game made me lose my mind and I've just gone crazy and I worship the king of all cosmos.
4878633	4885220	They want to look at the impact of electronic media use organized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
4886666	4895752	To go ahead and read a little bit of this article, even though the legislation called the Children and Media Research Advancement Act does not include restrictions, it appears to be intended as a way to justify them.
4896292	4905677	That's because a string of court decisions have been striking down anti-gaming laws because of a lack of hard evidence that minors are harmed by violence in video games.
4906778	4907778	I'm sorry, take that out on anyone.
4908099	4909920	Your tax dollars at work, ladies and gentlemen.
4910560	4913642	It's like, they can't admit that they're wrong.
4914560	4926729	They've, you know, how many times have we seen all of, you know, the courts basically upholding what we've been saying for ages, that there's not really any type of major harm to come to it unless you're counting home environment.
4927429	4929130	But they're saying, no, no, it's a video game.
4929190	4931292	Parents are not allowed to raise their children.
4933553	4934274	Stupid people.
4936395	4937076	Why is it that
4939073	4941614	Tag and Release Program Best Name Ever for Vaporware Like Melbourne, Australia?
4971133	4972475	I'm going to go ahead and quote from here.
4973075	4974757	I would like to add a bit to what he said.
4974837	4983085	The company spent around $62 million on stuff for the last year, with around $3.5 million spent on the actual console development.
4983346	4985488	This may be because the console is a scam.
4986212	4996976	You see what the console makers, or non-makers in this case, could be doing is just getting lots of money from investors to say they're going to make a console when they actually spend very little on the console and keep some of the money for themselves.
4997536	5002578	For example, they hire their family as consultants, pay them $200,000 a year while also paying themselves money.
5004298	5005799	If you ask me, quite a good idea, really.
5006694	5009216	Orange Launch Radio will be coming out with its own console very soon.
5009316	5012739	We're looking for investors, so if you have $11 billion, please send us an email.
5013219	5014880	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
5014900	5016081	We'd love to hear from you.
5016282	5019684	I remember when they were showing the Phantom at E3, was it in 2004?
5019924	5022526	They had a cute little booth.
5022706	5029472	Yeah, they had a booth, and I tried to go in the wrong entrance or something, and they got all pissed off at me or something.
5029872	5032574	So then I walked around the normal way, and then I saw their
5033463	5035145	T-shirt sucks, um
5059580	5064604	No, the only thing I liked about the console was the case, and I wanted to make a computer out of the case.
5064985	5069569	That was about it, because it had this, like, glowing blue light on the front, and that looked cool.
5070710	5073712	But other than that, it was, like, huge.
5073852	5077315	It was the size of a large VCR.
5077375	5078977	I mean, this thing was ginormous.
5079217	5080338	It looked like a stupid brick.
5082140	5082800	Any more emails?
5083381	5084201	One more, one more.
5084221	5084462	Alrighty.
5084742	5085342	From Jaded.
5085783	5086223	Hi, Jaded.
5086944	5086984	Um...
5087805	5092629	There's an interesting article that he wants us to look at about, it's actually something on Slashdot.
5095431	5099093	It's actually a really, really quick little article, so I'm just going to read what it says.
5099214	5099474	Sure.
5104738	5105038	Okay.
5105418	5114365	Kotaku has a great feature up today written by James Wagner, a formerly embedded reporter in the world of Second Life.
5115003	5117107	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5127841	5133824	For the thing of it is, game magazine previews are almost uniformly positive even for the most undistinguished titles.
5134284	5135424	So it unrolls thus.
5135524	5137045	Publisher makes mediocre game.
5137145	5144188	Press reviews, I'm sorry, press previews depict mediocre game as being good or at least worth a look.
5144488	5152311	Excited gamers read previews, foolishly believe them, start making pre-sale orders of mediocre games driven by preview press and pre-sale numbers based on that press.
5154952	5157272	Hey, Yola.
5157872	5160373	Let's see.
5160473	5166494	Maybe if we add on to that successfully, we get E, gamers discover independent podcasts.
5167034	5169975	F, gamers get the real story from people who actually play the games.
5170375	5172215	G, quality games inherit the earth.
5173495	5174035	Hooray for us.
5176476	5178556	We are your video game saviors.
5180337	5180717	Hooray.
5180877	5181257	All right.
5182183	5182844	Is that it for the mail?
5183104	5183344	Yep.
5183404	5188286	Alright, send your mail to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Loki, take us out of this hour.
5188306	5191808	You have some follow-ups, some quickie little follow-ups to things we were bitching about last week.
5192208	5205895	Yeah, the first thing is, if you're hoping for another NFL game by someone other than EA, sorry, NFL extended the CBA and EA still holds exclusive rights to the NFL.
5206415	5206675	Sorry.
5206875	5207835	Eh, I kind of saw that coming.
5208216	5208896	Yeah, anyways.
5209918	5212081	The Origami, what is the Origami?
5212501	5220473	It is a 7 inch tablet PC that runs Windows and it's going to be under $1000 Only?
5221153	5223136	Yeah, is it a gaming system?
5223377	5223477	No
5224153	5225273	It's not a gaming system.
5225333	5228695	It's more of a micro-laptop type thing.
5228735	5229935	Minesweeper on the go.
5229995	5230335	Hello.
5230655	5235177	Actually, there is a video file out on YouTube.
5235917	5237418	I love YouTube.
5237638	5244000	Where someone apparently leaked one of their marketing demos that they were showing during their little meetings.
5244420	5246381	And it did show somebody actually playing a game on it.
5246481	5248281	Well, actually, that wasn't a market.
5248361	5250562	It was on their viral site that they had online.
5251122	5257445	OrigamiProject.com and it was just a concept, proof of concept.
5257545	5261246	They weren't actually playing a video or a game because it was showing Halo 2.
5262527	5265028	But then they listed it there as a potential for the machine.
5265388	5266809	DarkTetsuya in our chatroom says $999.99.
5266889	5269169	When you say under $1,000, does that mean $999.99?
5269209	5269470	More likely.
5269490	5270250	They're going to sell it for $656.
5270290	5271310	They have three different versions of the
5278474	5279875	It's not even really the origami.
5279915	5282737	It's like, I forget what it's called now.
5282817	5287720	It's the mini PC or something like that.
5287780	5289921	I forget how they were calling them.
5291102	5294664	It's basically just this really small PC.
5295765	5296285	That's about it.
5297806	5298086	All right.
5298767	5299447	Any other follow-ups?
5301068	5301188	No.
5301448	5302009	All right.
5302049	5303770	Then I think we're finally due for a break.
5303850	5307192	Our first hour has turned into our first hour and a half segment, but that's okay.
