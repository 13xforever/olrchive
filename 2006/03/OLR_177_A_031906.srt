00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,440
Tonight, March 19th, 2006, a barrage of updates on the PlayStation 3, we dispel April Fools

2
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,640
rumors already hitting the internet, and do we really have to say goodbye to Katamari

3
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:32,880
The Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,040
Welcome everybody to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,780
We're here to give you the news that gamers really want to know about.

6
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:40,780
My name is Rob Roberts.

7
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,780
You might know me as Sky.

8
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,720
Joining me as always, say hello to my awesome co-host, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,720
Yo.

10
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,720
How you doing?

11
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,720
Full.

12
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,720
Full?

13
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,720
You just ate before the show?

14
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,720
Yeah.

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,720
I had my usual burrito.

16
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,720
Awesome.

17
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,480
What makes it a burrito of doom? Is it blessed by the Dark Lord Satan or what?

18
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,400
I'm just kidding, I don't know. No, no, Satan decided not to bless my burrito.

19
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,760
I see, all right. Also say hello to our tech master, Loki.

20
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,120
Hello. How you doing?

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:15,080
I'm good, I feel like a Got Milk commercial. I have all that chocolate from those brownie

22
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:20,080
bites in my mouth. I know, that's like two weeks in a row that we've had those brownie bites here.

23
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,040
I went to Starbucks to go buy them, but they only had two

24
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,960
They're also out of white mocha, which I don't really care because I don't drink coffee

25
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,120
But Nellie wanted a white mocha. So so you had to hear all that complaining

26
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,600
No, and then I don't know. I don't like Starbucks

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,000
What's that? Oh, yay brownie. Anyway, we're here on this episode number

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,620
177 for this March 19th of 2006 and we got a lot of news to go into tonight so

29
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,600
let's just start getting into the show we always started off talking about how

30
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,700
our gaming week was the kinds of games we played this week little mini reviews

31
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:02,220
on stuff we've looked into and just so you know that we're gamers too you know

32
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:07,180
Dark Sakura what you've been doing this week um actually a lot of Animal

33
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:11,380
Crossing again just because it's what I can play at work other the rest of my

34
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:18,340
times been spent like doing school stuff um however um I uh my husband has told

35
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,540
me that I'm getting a PSP of my very own soon because of a certain case that will

36
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:28,380
be associated with a certain game what's this the for me and my katamari

37
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:32,180
apparently there's a case being released that's in the shape of the prince's head

38
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,980
oh I think I saw a picture of that somewhere I don't know if it was a

39
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,100
custom thing or the official one I know I've seen a picture of a PSP well it's

40
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,100
It's gotta be official if it's being shipped to GameStop.

41
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,300
Well, I know, I know, but I'm wondering if the picture I saw was the official one or a fan,

42
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,400
because you know fans probably did one, too, before that.

43
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,700
But, uh, so, uh, he has told me in no uncertain terms I'm getting my own PSP.

44
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,100
So that means I could probably give you yours back.

45
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,600
Yeah, yeah, I'd like mine back any day now.

46
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,800
No, you know what? I...

47
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,500
There's, well, the only time I really need mine back is when me and my Katamari comes out,

48
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,900
and there's a couple other games I want to check out, too, but honestly, guys,

49
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,700
this week is all about the DS for me.

50
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,920
And when we get into releases this week, I think you'll understand why.

51
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,240
And a lot of you guys probably already know, but we'll talk about that later.

52
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,540
Animal Crossing. I noticed a lot of people

53
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,000
kinda left Animal Crossing for other DS games.

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,680
Is Animal Crossing really the type of game you can kinda go back to, or is it

55
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,080
kinda one of those games that once you stop playing it, it gets too tough to get back into again?

56
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,840
I think you can pick it up at any time. You just have to be willing to do a lot of

57
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,680
weeding and

58
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,800
you know, kiss an ass of your town people.

59
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:47,800
But I also found out, this is when I was at the doctor yesterday, I played a lot of Puzzle Fighter.

60
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,800
A lot of Puzzle Fighter on my Game Boy Micro.

61
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,800
Oh, right on, like the old school, yeah. I love Puzzle Fighter.

62
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,800
I love street puzzle mode.

63
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,800
I really haven't touched Puzzle Fighter in a long time. I never played the Game Boy one.

64
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,800
There's no real differences from the PlayStation one, right? It's all the same?

65
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,800
It's all the same.

66
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,040
name. Actually I think it's slightly harder but then again I've been playing it on the

67
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,380
Micro where it's like really really tiny. Yeah I see that's why I won't get a Micro

68
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:20,320
because you know my eyesight's borderline bad enough. Mine was a gift. Puzzle Games,

69
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,400
you know what Puzzle Game never really came out for a home console that kind of made me

70
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,040
sad? They used to have this game at Golf Land Local Arcade, the Battle Balls, did you ever

71
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,040
play that with the marbles that you had to stack like four in a row? I never played that.

72
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,720
I was kind of fun it was it was an import game I know that Capcom game

73
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,800
is it I don't know what about what about

74
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,840
I'll shoot what was that one magical drop

75
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,400
magical drop kinda have like a resurgence you can get on your phone I

76
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,480
had magical drop on my cell phone go figure

77
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,440
amazing I am course at magical drop on any a GSCD

78
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,000
well I mean that's the way to do it if you wanna do it authentic but I'm

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,200
pretty sure magical drop also existed

80
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:02,100
I wanna say there was a version of it on Super Nintendo but please don't quote me

81
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:02,400
on that.

82
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,360
I thought that they did one actually for the Pocket. Did they get you a Pocket?

83
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,680
Probably because it was an SNK game. For some reason I don't remember, I remember

84
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,640
they did Cotton.

85
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:16,160
Which is, actually I need to find my copy of it because I've been really

86
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,040
getting back into some of my older gaming. We're actually hooking up the

87
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,760
Turbo Duo so I can play Space Fantasy Zone

88
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,800
that one of our listeners sent me.

89
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,840
Lucky.

90
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,880
Listeners don't send me gifts.

91
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,240
Oh, in a way, that's totally not true.

92
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,900
I totally just, they don't send me gifts,

93
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,920
but I got one in person.

94
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,920
I got a pretty big one in person not that long ago,

95
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,800
so I can't say that.

96
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,640
My bad.

97
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,600
I also found a very interesting book.

98
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,640
I was at Barnes and Noble last night,

99
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,000
and there was a retro magazine that they did

100
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,700
with the Super R-Type on the cover.

101
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,540
I was like, yeah!

102
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,540
They have like a gaming retro magazine?

103
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,040
Yeah.

104
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,540
That's kind of rad. I didn't know that.

105
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:05,540
There's also another book that was something about writing and poetry spawned from old video games.

106
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:09,540
It was one of the end cap books in the fantasy section that made me laugh.

107
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,540
Haikus?

108
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,040
I don't think it was a Haiku book.

109
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,540
You know what we should have on orangehonestredo.com is a Haiku forum.

110
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:22,900
Oh great video game how I love thee so much

111
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,220
I play you all day. It's beautiful

112
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,260
I was moved. It actually was right too.

113
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,860
You guys, I saw your fingers tapping as you were talking

114
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,740
That was good. Anything else you want to share about your week? Ouch.

115
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,700
Alright. Loki, how was your gaming week? My week was okay

116
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,740
I've been playing a lot of the Xbox stuff

117
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:50,140
I bought the outfit and I played that for about half an hour, so that's kind of cool.

118
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:54,340
I haven't really gotten the back to touch it, I've been trying to finish up getting

119
00:06:54,340 --> 00:07:01,420
the rest of my achievements in full auto and I have one left and that's rank 10 online.

120
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:09,780
I just got my million, or was it a million, like was it a million points in just the game

121
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:15,960
and then 100 no 1000 kills I got the achievement for that and they have rank

122
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,800
9 I just did and then I just have ranked 10 online to do and I'm done the game

123
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,920
what are achievement points to you are you an achievement point horror where

124
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,880
you have to have like the as many as you possibly can yes and no I'm kind of that

125
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,940
way too it's like I just want to get done at the game because I'm not really

126
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,200
playing it too much anymore and it's just it's okay multiplayer but it's not

127
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,420
that fun so I just want to get done with it so if I feel like selling it I know

128
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,420
that I've milked all the achievement points out of it that I could possibly

129
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:50,820
get so I'm kind of yes and no on the achievement points like if I see like

130
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:56,100
for instance take take geometry Wars geometry Wars has an achievement point

131
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,780
that you get like five or ten points I remember for what's called pacifism

132
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,820
where you don't get hit by anything for seconds exactly I was kind of like okay

133
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:08,540
normally I wouldn't play the game like that but okay if I get 10 points out of it I'll

134
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,340
try it out and it actually is kind of tough I didn't get it my first try it was actually

135
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:16,100
a bit of a challenge but you know I'll go out of my way for little things like that

136
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,700
but I know people that like there was an article on the internet I don't remember if it was

137
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:24,900
this week or last week but it was about how to get easily 6000 gamer points.

138
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,340
It's all sports games.

139
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:31,700
And I'm kind of like okay nah that's not cool I mean that's that's you know if that's the

140
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:37,020
the way you're getting the gamers points then, you know, that means nothing when you look

141
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,020
at the score.

142
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,260
I mean, it's unfortunate that the score doesn't really tell you right away how the points

143
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,800
were gotten, but I still really like the system.

144
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,140
I think it's really kind of innovative, it's certainly different.

145
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:52,420
But I've been playing, I did play a little bit of Geometry Wars, I did get the Pacifist

146
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:59,280
achievement, which was a pain in the ass, and then I've only been able to get about

147
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,640
100,000 and then I get blown up pretty quick.

148
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,080
I really suck at Geometry Wars.

149
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,640
There's too much flashy shit on the screen, and I've been wondering if I should try it

150
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,300
in retro mode, if that'll make a difference, but...

151
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,920
Your score won't rank, and it's just a different mode.

152
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,560
I mean, I take it back, there is a ranking mode for it, but it's not the same one that

153
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,520
the achievements unlock on.

154
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,840
So if you want achievements, you gotta deal with it.

155
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,200
It's just too flashy, like there's too many particles in there and stuff.

156
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,760
I was actually reading an FAQ on the game, or I was looking on forums or something, I

157
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:33,740
I might have actually been on the official Xbox forums looking for hints on how to play and people are saying like oh you should

158
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,900
Be able to breeze through the first 500k easily

159
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,520
I'm like okay

160
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:42,040
Am I just old and my hand-eye coordination has gone way down or what because I really have a hard time breaking

161
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,940
Like 200k on a regular basis

162
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,180
Maybe I'm just like I read a tip that I thought was interesting and the tip

163
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:52,060
Suggested that like if you're having a hard time with it you focus on your ship and nothing

164
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,500
But the ship like you don't allow anything else on the screen to distract you except your ship

165
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,500
so that way you're dodging no matter what and that will help you get through

166
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,020
like at least like if they say the first 500k or million or something like that

167
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,180
but then after that you really do have to use your peripheral vision because I

168
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,900
guess things just start bombarding you like crazy but that'll at least help you

169
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,780
if you're struggling in the beginning like I am like you are so I don't know

170
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,500
and then I was playing feeding frenzy and the thing I like about this and the

171
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,940
fact the way the achievements are is it's a game where say I beat ten levels

172
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:28,280
of it, I can start it back later and play starting from level 10 and keep going on.

173
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:34,800
So it makes achievements really simple on it, and plus it's a pretty simple game actually.

174
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,120
And that's the one where you start off as a small fish and eat your way up until you

175
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,180
become bigger enough to eat the larger fish.

176
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:45,120
I've played a game exactly like that at Dave & Buster's except it gave you tickets.

177
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,560
And I have to say tickets are a little cooler than the achievement points because tickets

178
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,720
I can trade in for stuffed animals, which is cool.

179
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,300
I'm just waiting for like when they come up with something on Xbox Live that you can only

180
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,840
access it if you have X amount of achievement points or something like that.

181
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,720
I think that would be kind of neat if they, like it doesn't necessarily have to be like

182
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,200
a game but like something like a, maybe like a beta only open to hardcore players who got

183
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,340
a certain amount of achievement points on something or you know maybe one of these deals

184
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:20,940
but the problem is, is that it's these articles like the how to get 6000 gamers points easily

185
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,440
are going to kind of screw that up and unfortunately some games the achievement points are way

186
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,820
easier to get than others.

187
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:31,540
For instance, going with Xbox Live Arcade, Crystal Quest compared to Bejeweled, Bejeweled

188
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:36,680
you have to play hardcore because all the achievements practically are like astronomical

189
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,260
numbers of rounds and points.

190
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:42,980
Whereas Crystal Quest, if you get pretty good at it, you'll only have to play through one

191
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:46,900
or two times to really unlock the bulk of achievement points.

192
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:50,260
have to spend time with it for the others but I mean could put the two

193
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:55,380
games side by side and you know it's much easier to get it in the one I don't

194
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,220
know but other than that I've been playing a little bit burnout a little

195
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:05,380
bit of full auto of course the outfit as they mentioned and I think that's pretty

196
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,620
much it just been kind of bouncing around from those in a little bit of

197
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:13,660
Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories of course and god I think there was another

198
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:17,580
of the game in there too. Oh, I actually played The Simpsons on my MAME cabinet for a little

199
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,420
bit. Yeah, that's about it.

200
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,500
Alright, awesome. Yes, Star Chakra?

201
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,500
Nothing.

202
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,500
Oh, I thought you had a thought, because you reached for your mic suddenly. I thought maybe-

203
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,100
I thought it was going to fall.

204
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,180
You know what it might be, is that you're getting ready to scold me for my gaming week?

205
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,700
Oh no, what'd you do?

206
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,860
I spent the majority of my gaming week playing Final Fantasy XI.

207
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,980
Addict! That's okay, I went back to Ragnarok online.

208
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,980
Alright, so we're even.

209
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,980
Yeah, so I've been playing Final Fantasy XI starting over from scratch.

210
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,980
And I think I mentioned on the last podcast I was going to do this.

211
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,980
Well, I've actually been in the habit of doing it this week and playing.

212
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,980
I'm already up to level 9, yes!

213
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,980
And soon I'll be level 30 and be all ready for the expansion pack when it comes out.

214
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,980
Because the expansion pack definitely looks like it's going to be worth a try.

215
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,980
They're incorporating elements of older Final Fantasies and stuff into it, which is kind of neat.

216
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,980
Like somebody pointed out to me in the trailer,

217
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:14,620
see one of the judges from Final Fantasy Tactics and stuff in it, so I think that's kind of neat,

218
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:19,420
so we'll see what happens with that. I am interested in some of the new classes. I'm

219
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:24,220
prepping my little Taru because I reincarnated myself as a Taru. I said I'm doing an absolute

220
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,780
clean start. New server, so I can't get any of the same help I had before, new character,

221
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:33,260
new everything, so I reincarnated myself as a little Taru Taru, so I plan on being a blue mage,

222
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:36,380
but the problem is that everybody's going to be a blue mage when that thing rolls out.

223
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,900
I remember Lil' Kim.

224
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:43,100
Lil' Kim was my mule on my old server, and she was a Tarou as well, so...

225
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,980
I'll tell you the name of my new character off-air, but I will say I play on the Seraph server now,

226
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:53,100
so I'm watching you guys, Seraph server. I'll talk smack about you on the show if you wrong me.

227
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,860
I'll tell you my character name off-air, because it's really cool, so... I just don't want to get...

228
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:01,740
You actually reminded me that I did forget to say that I'm on a free server for Ragnarok.

229
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,620
What ever happened with, like, the legality of that? Isn't that kind of a gray area?

230
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,620
I don't think Gravity cares anymore.

231
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,120
Really?

232
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,620
As long as they're making money, huh?

233
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,120
The server that I'm playing on is super dedicated.

234
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,620
I mean, it's like, it's so much better than playing on, like, IRO.

235
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,620
I've never had any problem.

236
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,620
It's been really great.

237
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:27,120
As far as the rest of my gaming week, I also was playing quite a bit of Xbox Live Arcade.

238
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,620
I checked out Jewel Quest.

239
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:33,620
I actually bought Jewel Quest because I, you know, I knew it was kind of like Bejeweled and I like Bejeweled.

240
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:37,340
so I bought it. My problem with Jewel Quest is that it's

241
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,660
too much like Bejeweled, like I didn't... I don't know, for some reason I just...

242
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,340
you know, it's so easy to spend like five bucks on those crap little games

243
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:44,860
sometimes

244
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:48,580
and, you know, I bought it and then I realized this really is just the same

245
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,460
damn thing as Bejeweled, but I'll tell you this,

246
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,340
I don't think Jewel Quest is put together as nicely as they put together

247
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,620
Bejeweled on Xbox Live.

248
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,780
Have you played either one or both? No. Bejeweled is really polished

249
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:02,500
and looks really nice and uses the high def. Jewel Quest seems to have

250
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,600
frame rate issues.

251
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,000
The achievement points are certainly easier but honestly I'm not really

252
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,640
considering that in my review of the game.

253
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:14,000
I put the game side by side. I definitely prefer Bejeweled. I think it's got

254
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,160
some more modes. I think it's just more polished looking when you consider that

255
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,800
they're essentially the same game.

256
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,720
I mean not really. Jewel Quest is about not how many

257
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,960
three in a row you connect but where you get them on the board and it kind of

258
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,400
influences your strategy a little bit but really

259
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,320
they play very similarly. I do recommend Bejeweled over Jewel Quest.

260
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,560
even if the achievement points are harder, it's a game with better music,

261
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,920
better graphics, and I think I like the presentation a little more

262
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,440
in Bejeweled.

263
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,800
And when the game themselves are very similar, it's all about the presentation.

264
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:49,280
I want Tetris. I don't know if that would happen, because Nintendo owns

265
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,000
rights to Tetris in America. They have Tetris Grandmaster that came out for the

266
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,480
Japanese launch. It's a really extremely retarded game.

267
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,880
I think it would be better as an Xbox Live Arcade game. What does Nintendo own the rights to

268
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:06,040
when it comes to Tetris then, because remember when it got into Nintendo vs. Tengen Tetris?

269
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,920
Oh, but those were both on the NES, too, I guess.

270
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,920
Maybe that's what it has to do with.

271
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,160
I don't think they own the rights to Tetris, to be honest, because, I mean, we've seen

272
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,880
Tetris Worlds and stuff on the PlayStation.

273
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,840
Maybe they own the exclusive rights for their own systems or something, because you notice

274
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,960
all the Tetris games that come out on Nintendo systems are Nintendo games.

275
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,880
Like this new DS one that's coming out is a Nintendo game, the old Game Boy one.

276
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,880
I don't know.

277
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,880
I don't know.

278
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,920
Somebody in the chat room knows, I don't know.

279
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,840
That's OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on chat if you want to share some information with

280
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:39,560
us or of course you can always drop us an email as well, mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

281
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,640
Let's get into some gaming news for tonight.

282
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,840
Let's start it off, I think a lot of us might have something to contribute here with the

283
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:49,220
PlayStation 3, obviously they had that huge press conference earlier this week.

284
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:53,080
Probably most of you guys on the internet have read it by now, but we have to talk about

285
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,080
it anyway.

286
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,080
Certainly we want to give our input.

287
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,600
Loki, start us off with a summary, what did we find out about after this conference this

288
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,200
While they announce a few things about both the PlayStation 3 and PSP, let's start off

289
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,840
with the PlayStation 3.

290
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,480
Of course, it's going to be launched in November.

291
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:12,840
I think that was only news to Sony because everyone else figured that it was going to

292
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,840
be November.

293
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,840
Well, it's nice to hear them actually confirm it because I think most of us were thinking

294
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,680
it was going to be 2007 at this point.

295
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,680
Well, I'm not confirming it and saying that they're actually going to make it in November

296
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:30,680
because I mean, after all, Microsoft did say they were going to ship three million units

297
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,420
by the three month mark, and that never happened.

298
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,400
I credit Sony with a little bit more brains than Microsoft.

299
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,000
Well, we'll see.

300
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,140
I don't know about that.

301
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,560
You know what's interesting is that I was reading a separate article this week that

302
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,040
talked about the launch of the Sega Saturn, and when they launched that, it was like a

303
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,620
surprise announcement at E3, it was one of those things that was like, we're not telling

304
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,440
you to wait until November, it's on shelves today.

305
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,240
And I think that's kind of cool, but at the same time, it also kind of killed the system

306
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,060
because with the surprise announcement, there wasn't enough time for all the developers

307
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:03,340
to get the games out, so, I mean, it's kind of a double-edged sword there.

308
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:08,760
What killed the system, what killed the Saturn was Sega's whole marketing ploy.

309
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,960
The Saturn did very well in Japan, and it had much better games that we never saw, that

310
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,480
never saw the light of day in the US.

311
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,480
True.

312
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,480
And it was very import-friendly.

313
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,480
True.

314
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,480
True.

315
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,480
So that's what killed the Saturn.

316
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,480
Anyway, sorry, this isn't about Sega.

317
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,480
It's about Sony.

318
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,480
Anyway, moving on.

319
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:28,360
It's going to be released somewhere in the first 10-11 days of November.

320
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,280
So the early part of November there.

321
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:37,380
And it's going to be including a 60 gigabyte hard drive pre-installed with Linux.

322
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,380
So ha!

323
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,380
They beat the...

324
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,460
I think that's kind of funny is that they've kind of just given in to the fact that somebody's

325
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,600
going to install Linux on this anyway, so here you go.

326
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,600
And it's going to be us.

327
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,080
Anyways, so I thought that was funny.

328
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:55,480
They're going to have, what was it, of course Blu-Ray is going to be the standard for all

329
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,360
the games on the system, not going to see any DVD games for it, which I thought was

330
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,360
kind of interesting.

331
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,400
Because they don't want them pirated.

332
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:10,360
Yes, at minimum it will be no less than 50,000 yen, or $425 US.

333
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,160
Do you believe the $900 price point people are saying?

334
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,340
That's full of crap.

335
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,280
It has to be full of crap, and I'm sorry to you guys in chat room that are yelling the

336
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,320
$900 thing right now, but, honestly, come on, Sony's gotta know better than that, they

337
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,320
know that will be suicide.

338
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,040
You have to understand this, it might be $900 if you bought the system for what it's actually

339
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:31,400
worth, but you know everyone sells systems at a loss, so Sony's gonna have to be prepared

340
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,640
to take a hell of a loss on these, it's gonna be interesting.

341
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,360
Gotta lose money to make money.

342
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:41,000
Yeah, I mean, the whole thing was with the Blu-ray drive and that's what half the cost

343
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:49,880
Oh well, it's going to be fully backwards compatible with all PlayStation and PlayStation

344
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,880
2 titles.

345
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,880
Bravo, smart move.

346
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,520
And they're going to basically upscale all of them like the 360 does with the games.

347
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,280
That was one of the most exciting announcements to me, honestly.

348
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:05,200
Also they're going to be digitally distributing PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 games to the

349
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,200
console.

350
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,720
I don't want to say I told you so, but I could swear we had a discussion just a couple weeks

351
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,960
to go about digital distribution and how it was kind of where the industry was moving

352
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,560
and hello, here we go, here's the proof.

353
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,560
Exactly.

354
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:27,380
And the final PS3 development kits are being sent to developers in June, so that should

355
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,380
be interesting.

356
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,180
Some of the other things I heard about, they're going to have of course the PlayStation Hub

357
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:38,120
service which is going to be for both the PlayStation Portable and the PS3 as well as

358
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:44,400
What's kind of neat about that is it will be free to play multiplayer games, but there's

359
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,480
going to be additional content on there that will cost money and they'll have subscription

360
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,080
services for that type of stuff.

361
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:58,700
The servers will not be a central server like Microsoft, they will be separate, each run

362
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,640
by different companies.

363
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,640
But you'll have this central hub that you'll be able to tie into, kind of like Xbox Live.

364
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,440
So it's both like it is now and both like, you know, kind of how Microsoft does their

365
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,440
servers.

366
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,440
Huh.

367
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,440
That's interesting.

368
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,640
Which is different, I guess.

369
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,280
Comments from chat room real fast, OrangeOrangeReady.com, click on chat.

370
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,360
Spirit Snare says, I think they're probably aiming for $550-ish.

371
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,120
$550 is a little more reasonable.

372
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:27,720
Honestly, if I were to make a prediction, I would say to compete with Microsoft, they

373
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,160
got to do one of two things.

374
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,680
They really have to release this system for $399, just like the Xbox.

375
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,080
It's not going to be less than $400.

376
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,920
Yeah, but they're flat out saying it's not going to be less than $400, so I'm thinking

377
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,040
that they're going to have to release, I think the price point will be $499 is my guess,

378
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,140
and of course I don't know shit, but $499 is my guess, but they're really going to emphasize

379
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:51,800
Blu-ray, this will play movies in high-death, and they're going to say you need this, and

380
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,360
they're going to really emphasize those things that that system can do that Xbox 360 doesn't

381
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,360
do.

382
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,360
What they need to do.

383
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,320
And I think you're going to see them throw in a bonus movie, like a free, like you remember

384
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,080
when PSP came out they gave Spider-Man 2 free. I bet you anything there's going to be a tie-in

385
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:09,880
where the first few Playstation Soul will come with a free Blu-ray movie. Whatever Sony's

386
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,640
big summer picture is will be the tie-in movie.

387
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,280
What they need to do is they need to have the system, they need to emphasize the fact

388
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:20,280
that you don't have to go out and buy all these additional peripherals and crap that

389
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:24,840
you have to do with the 360. Oh, I got a system! Oh, wait, now I got controllers. Oh, each

390
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,000
one of those are $40 each. Oh, I have to buy the right cables for my TV. By the way, those

391
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,980
are also $40 each. Now, oh, I didn't get a remote with mine. Oh, guess what, that's

392
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:38,360
$40 also. Yeah, it all adds up, you know, in the end. And by the way, those controllers,

393
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,600
how much does it cost Microsoft to make them? Oh yeah, it was like $10 or something.

394
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,720
Interesting way to look at it.

395
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,240
So, they're making their money back in peripherals. That's where all the money is.

396
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,760
Wait, isn't Spider-Man 3 this summer?

397
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,600
No, Spider-Man 3 is next summer.

398
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:49,960
Oh, okay.

399
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:54,760
Do you think we've just made a good point to give Advent Children as the free movie?

400
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,200
But would they be able to do that when it's really Square's movie?

401
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,140
I mean that's certainly a lot of fanboys would love to see that. Square's in Sony's bed.

402
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:06,120
I guess that's true. You never know. I'll be hot.

403
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,800
That would be. Anyways, certainly make it more attractive.

404
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,280
Now, the other things of course they were talking about was the PSP

405
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:18,000
and some of the stuff that's not much of a surprise. We knew that there was going

406
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,600
to be an iToy peripheral coming, a webcam type thing.

407
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:25,720
That's going to be coming I believe it was September was the

408
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:30,520
announced date for that and then of course GPS is coming on later in the

409
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,760
year probably in the third or fourth quarter.

410
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,440
Then of course with the iToy type of

411
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,720
peripheral on there they're going to be adding video phone support

412
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,320
in the fall. One of the other things that was kind of interesting

413
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,600
they did announce that there was going to be a core pack that's going to be a

414
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,560
reduced price

415
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:54,100
PSP. Basically, you're just getting the bare bones stuff, you're not getting a case, no

416
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:58,920
headphones, which, to be honest, the case and headphones kind of sucked anyways, so

417
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:06,540
save 50 bucks. And they're going to be releasing a ceramic white PSP core pack as well, which

418
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:12,380
is going to be pretty cool. I think that's Japan only for the white one. What is interesting

419
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:18,740
though is they're going to be offering an official PlayStation 1 emulator for the PSP.

420
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:24,640
And you'll be able to digitally download these straight off the internet to your PSP.

421
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:30,700
And I think this is where the 4GB NAND Flash PSP comes into play, where you'll be storing

422
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,000
these on your memory stick.

423
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,860
And I don't understand how these aren't going to be pirated from memory sticks, but I don't

424
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,860
know.

425
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,500
They're going to find a way I'm sure.

426
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:50,140
And of course, with the next update, the web browser will get Flash 6.0 support, so it

427
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,660
will be able to view most web pages.

428
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,580
We'll have to put some on our PSP site.

429
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:59,740
True, true, and also they're going to be able to record streaming audio.

430
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:02,100
Well that's cool.

431
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,740
You know what's interesting about the PSP to me is that they're really trying to think

432
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:12,400
of things that the DS hasn't done yet, like to really sell the system more as not a game

433
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,880
system but as a personal entertainment system, let's put it that way.

434
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:23,080
Like with the whole itoy support, being able to do the short videos and these exchanges

435
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:27,080
over the internet and stuff with the old games, I think they're really trying to think of

436
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:31,600
the things, and the web support too, like things that the DS really hasn't done yet,

437
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,200
Of course, most of the DS's innovations have been about the games itself, which, don't

438
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,600
get me wrong, have been great, but I think PSP, you really see it trying to solidify

439
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,760
itself as the more entertainment system as opposed to the game system.

440
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,840
Well, what's interesting with the GPS thing is it is going to be available.

441
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,160
One of the first games it's going to use is a new Hot Shots game coming out, which I thought

442
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,880
was interesting.

443
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,960
But apparently there's current games in the library right now that support it, but just,

444
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,400
you know, it hasn't been unlocked yet or whatever.

445
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:06,400
Uh, gs191 has a good comment in chatroom. Oh great, fucking Flash ads on my PSP.

446
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:11,080
Hey, I'm gonna tell you this much though. What I've been waiting for is Flash for the

447
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,800
website because

448
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:18,120
you can do a live 365 player in Flash and that's good.

449
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,200
Because you can listen to our show on the go.

450
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,400
That would be good.

451
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:28,120
What ever happened to the days when video game systems played video games?

452
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,840
Well, the PSP does play games, and they've certainly got a lot of good games coming out

453
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,600
this first quarter of this year, but I don't know, I think we're seeing this trend with

454
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:42,420
all the next-gen systems, that they don't want to be just the game system.

455
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:45,600
They want to be that centerpiece in your living room, and I think that's what we've heard

456
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,100
in a lot of press conferences, too.

457
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:52,020
They want to be the place where you can download movies, and look at Xbox 360, just released

458
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,520
this week on Xbox Live.

459
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,760
You can download a music video now for free.

460
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,960
So it's kind of like, you know, they're really, I don't think it's all necessarily about the

461
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,960
games anymore.

462
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,200
That is why I love my DS.

463
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,600
Why the only time, the only thing that PSP has ever been useful to me for is actually

464
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,720
just watching movies on the airplane, because I've watched Hellboy.

465
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,040
But Luminous is cool.

466
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,560
Luminous is good.

467
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:21,200
I haven't really played much else on the PSP that I really like other than that and Popolacross.

468
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,280
if I want if I wanna play a game I'm gonna play

469
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:30,160
a system dedicated to the game by a company dedicated to gameplay

470
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,720
I don't care what it looks like as long as it's fun

471
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:38,200
I you know it's sad

472
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,600
it's very it's sad. So you think people's focus aren't on the games themselves?

473
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,720
I remember the Odyssey 2. Right. That

474
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,360
crap came out when I was two years old. Right. I remember watching the little

475
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:56,520
blips on the screen and thinking that it was so much fun and just seeing the way that games

476
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:01,760
are going now you know the systems especially just sort of is heartbreaking you know it's

477
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:07,560
very sad very sad that people can't be satisfied with good gameplay we'll see we'll see all

478
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:13,760
right um moving on anything else you want to share on the sony there loki um i was just

479
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,160
trying to think some of the interesting thought our thoughts about it um they did mention

480
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:23,640
I think it was the PSP web camera, their itoy, I guess they're calling it.

481
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:30,840
It's gonna be, they're calling it like PSP 290 or something and I figured okay well firmware

482
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,720
2.9 then is gonna support this or something like that.

483
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:39,840
It was just kind of the, I guess their item code or whatever for it kind of tied in with

484
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,280
the firmware that will support it.

485
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,280
I think it's a good thing.

486
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:48,280
I'm glad to see some cool peripherals and stuff come out.

487
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:53,280
I was hoping that that web camera or iToy can be used as a digital camera.

488
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,280
I hope it's good enough for that.

489
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,280
I think it will.

490
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,280
The only thing I don't understand is how the fuck are you going to use it as an iToy?

491
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,280
Seriously, are you going to be flailing around?

492
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,280
It's not going to work like that.

493
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:08,280
I don't know. I think it's more like what you're saying there.

494
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,280
I think it's going to be more for chatting and for picture taking.

495
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:15,140
You know why why not for if the PSP is gonna be a little entertainment in a box

496
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:18,260
Why not be digital camera as well? You know people like digital cameras

497
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,520
People like cell phones that play music and have iTunes on

498
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,120
fucking dumbasses

499
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,580
Alright, let's go on to some other news this week

500
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:35,240
Let's get into some news about a very popular PlayStation game this one being on the ps2 right Loki Final Fantasy 12

501
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:40,440
12 god damn we've been waiting for that for a long time of course if you're in

502
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,520
Japan you're already playing it and it's awesome but if you're looking for it in

503
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,880
the u.s. you're gonna have to wait until Thanksgiving that's when it's coming

504
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:54,520
out I've heard and fattened fantastic reviews on this game of course we

505
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:58,640
mentioned for me to magazine last week but I'm very excited about 5-12 and

506
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,880
wish I wish it wouldn't take him some damn long to release it here I'm still

507
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,480
laughing about the potion commercial I haven't seen that yet I know somebody

508
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:11,480
posted I have a friend who lives in Japan right now who said I guess she

509
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:17,080
thinks it's tasty I'm looking forward to the game I love the battle system I know

510
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,640
a lot of people have acted really weird about it but being the addict I am with

511
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,480
Final Fantasy 11 I think it's a great combination of 11 and the old-school

512
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,200
Final Fantasies I'm looking forward to trying it out if it plays anything like

513
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,160
11 I'll guarantee I won't play it well it doesn't play like yeah thank God

514
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:36,360
Because you don't have to spend an hour looking for a party. You're it's already there. It's part of the story to be honest

515
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,080
No, I don't like the gameplay in 11, which is part of my

516
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:45,680
be honest, it reminds me of a cross between Final Fantasy like x2 or X and and

517
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,000
10

518
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,400
Final Fantasy X and x2 and

519
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,560
I

520
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,160
Just like doing that

521
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,360
In parasite Eve, I mean parasite Eve

522
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,860
it reminds me of the battle system where they did that where you've got this sphere

523
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:04,240
where you can attack. Basically it's just you can run around and do shit

524
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,640
but it's still like kind of an active time battle system.

525
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:11,640
Yeah, kinda. Alright so we'll be looking forward to

526
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,920
Final Fantasy XII coming out very soon. Now

527
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:18,480
the Nintendo Revolution has some rumors going around about it this week and the

528
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,400
rumor is that it's coming out in June.

529
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:25,280
Let's see, it was being told to Business Week.

530
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:29,540
The quote was, there are rumors that the revolution could be released as early as

531
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,280
June.

532
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,640
If that happens and Nintendo sells around 1 million units,

533
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,080
Sony could have a harder time catching up. And

534
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,460
that quote comes from Akitaro Ito from Japan's game tracking service

535
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:46,040
Media Create. Now of course when you look at the reality of it, the chance of

536
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,400
the console actually coming out in June

537
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,200
probably not going to happen and the reason why is because the development

538
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,640
hardware is not out there right now so if that's not out

539
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,640
it's gonna be very hard for the games to be out by June so probably

540
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:03,560
November is more realistic time frame and Nintendo's also been kinda quoted

541
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:07,280
recently saying Thanksgiving week of 2006 so

542
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,520
I don't think there really is gonna be any June surprise in store so

543
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,760
nothing like that whole

544
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,800
Sega thing we were talking about earlier where they surprise us at E3. Not likely

545
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:20,640
sorry to say. Moving on, something that works for Nintendo, Miyamoto

546
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,600
yes Miyamoto reacted to the PlayStation 3 announcement

547
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:30,340
this week. Not too surprising the way he reacted is basically

548
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:34,560
you know kind of put a quote out there that's saying you know

549
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,600
people are kinda getting tired of the same old video games nowadays

550
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:43,720
and what these you know like Microsoft and Sony are doing for video games as

551
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,680
far as they're improving the graphics but they're not really changing the

552
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,960
gameplay any

553
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:53,080
and so he's not too worried just because they've never really seen the other

554
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:57,260
companies as competition because they're kind of in their own boat basically is

555
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,760
being innovative

556
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,860
whereas you know these guys are just pushing graphics and stuff

557
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:05,560
you're not really pushing better gameplay

558
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,900
well I'm not surprised to hear that coming from Miyamoto not at all

559
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:12,220
it's just you know I I have to agree

560
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:15,380
I mean games aren't really that much better

561
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:18,780
they look at what Jamie was saying it looks prettier but they're not different I mean

562
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:22,820
look at like in a personal stance just looking at like sales like a

563
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:27,340
of different games out there. When I'm selling to customers and stuff, you know, it's like

564
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:31,280
everything. Oh yeah, this is like Grand Theft Auto. Yeah, this is like Grand Theft Auto.

565
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:35,480
This is like Grand Theft Auto. Oh yeah, this is Grand Theft Auto. It's just everything

566
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,560
is very similar to one another and they're all copying off each other and there's not

567
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:43,280
really anything innovative. And those games that are innovative do stand out, like Shadow

568
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:47,760
Colossus, Katamari Damacy, and stuff like that.

569
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:52,600
I have to ask Jamie having said that a little bit ago about the you know it's

570
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:56,400
sad that the systems are kind of leaning towards being all one. Does this strike

571
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:00,400
you as Nintendo being committed to the games?

572
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:07,240
yeah I mean that's always what they've been about you know why why would they

573
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:12,640
ever change their stance for the sake of following with the the same cookie

574
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,840
cutter that everybody else is on. They have released some real odd things in the

575
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,640
like I think about the Game Boy printer

576
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:21,440
what the hell was that? That was funny. And the e-reader?

577
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,440
The e-reader was a good idea. Yeah but it just

578
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,800
good idea didn't really work out though I don't think. But you know what? At least they tried

579
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,800
and I would rather see them try and fail at it than

580
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,160
not see them try at all. They try to be innovative. They're not afraid to innovate. I mean look at the Virtual Boy

581
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,240
dumb idea but you know what? It's a step in the right direction. The great

582
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,120
mining machine.

583
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:43,000
Granted they should have probably not gone monochrome red and they probably

584
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,520
should have

585
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,560
made it less cumbersome, but you know, I think it's a good idea.

586
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:51,560
It did have the best commercials. The one thing, and some other stuff that they

587
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,080
mentioned too, they were saying

588
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,760
you know, that the games nowadays are starting to become

589
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,400
you know, just beefed up versions of existing games, and of course with that

590
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,880
the budgets are getting bigger, but you don't always need to have big budgets to

591
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,440
create

592
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,920
you know, successful games. And for example, look at Brain Training,

593
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,520
which is selling like crazy over there, and

594
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,640
I don't know. It probably didn't cost that much to make.

595
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,000
It's definitely not, you know, perfect example.

596
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I just read an article for the Godfather game.

597
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,480
I just saw the same thing. I just saw this. Like not even an hour before the

598
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,080
show tonight. The Godfather game.

599
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:30,680
Eight hundred million dollars to produce this game

600
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,560
and they're gonna be trying to make this money back.

601
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,160
And to be honest, it's another fucking goddamn

602
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,740
Grand Theft Auto clone except oh now it has Marlon Brando in it

603
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:47,320
oh okay that doesn't make it any better well now to be fair that article is more

604
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,800
say they didn't spend a hundred ten million on the game they

605
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,240
the name yeah well not just that but the fact that they didn't release it at

606
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,080
Christmas time

607
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,880
cost them about 800 million to that but I'm sitting here going well it still

608
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,320
cost like multi-millions dollars make of course I'm not surprised you have a voice

609
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,240
acting that you're basically making a movie

610
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:07,200
on a console but I'm like yeah I totally see what you're saying there

611
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:12,400
usually these movie to games that they spend a lot of that money on are crap, I can't think

612
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,620
of a whole lot of good ones, I'm sure there's some, they're not coming to mind right now,

613
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:25,620
but you know, you take a game like Tetris, written out of some guy's basement, amazing.

614
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:33,760
Alright, so, moving on, I have another quick quote on Miyamoto, this is coming from an

615
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,020
on the Nintendo Europe website for those you guys that were saying that Twilight

616
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:40,760
Princess was being delayed because it was going to be compatible with

617
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,280
revolution in some way

618
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:47,800
guess what you were right you were right it didn't even Nintendo say earlier that

619
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,240
is not the reason why they delayed Twilight Princess

620
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,200
yeah and here's Miyamoto saying and one of the most important features is that

621
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:58,700
because revolution can run GameCube software when you play Twilight Princess

622
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:03,240
on revolution you can take advantage of the revolution controller which makes

623
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,480
Nintendo our liar of the week

624
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,840
congratulations Nintendo you are liars

625
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,680
of the week good job now you're going to

626
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,720

627
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,000
go third place baby third place no just

628
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,840
kidding I i'd like to see a little love

629
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,200
for Nintendo and it's just land huh

630
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,600
they go to Disneyland

631
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,320
all right dark soccer you've been doing

632
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,480
some reading this week right cuz yes I

633
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,400
can read reading books is good once in a

634
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,880
while I'm actually reading about two

635
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,920
novels right now, but I've also been getting magazines.

636
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,920
That's right.

637
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,920
And what have you read in a magazine recently?

638
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:42,280
Actually, there's a magazine called Script Magazine, which unfortunately, in my rush

639
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,800
to leave the house today, I did not bring with me.

640
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:51,620
However, I've read this in-depth, written sort of screenplay style, where it's basically

641
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:58,040
just sort of a day in the life of the production process for Silent Hill, you know, talking

642
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:05,080
with the producer in France going over some of the lame ideas he started to bring up like

643
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:11,220
well, no, we want to protect the integrity of the franchise and it's a really neat article.

644
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,680
So I take it no dog ending.

645
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,680
That would be hilarious.

646
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:19,400
I think after the credits, oh my God, like you stay after the credits and then there's

647
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,400
a dog ending.

648
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,400
That'd be great.

649
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,640
Or UFO.

650
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,400
I hope they did that for the fans.

651
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,560
I'll be so happy.

652
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:35,040
They were fully bringing up how awesome it was to work with Kiryamoga, that was pretty

653
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,040
cool.

654
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,920
But it's a very good article, in fact, I'll tell you what, as soon as I can find the power

655
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:45,720
supply for my scanner, I'll make it available for our listeners, but I would suggest going

656
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,720
out and buying the magazine.

657
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,680
Yes, because, you know, illegal reproductions are wrong, kids.

658
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,040
I can transcribe it.

659
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,480
There you go.

660
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,280
Alright, um, very interesting, is that Script Magazine?

661
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,560
Script Magazine, the I is in parenthesis.

662
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:03,500
Now you're probably not going to be able to walk into a grocery store and find that.

663
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,100
Actually, you can walk into Barnes and Noble, Borders.

664
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:10,740
Comprehensive Magazine Store. I was at Borders when I saw it. Actually, Tower would be

665
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,980
very likely to carry it since they carry all sorts of

666
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,380
interesting... I don't think they have that everywhere.

667
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,940
Probably Barnes and Noble and Borders and that stuff they do, though.

668
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:23,320
And if all else fails, a lot of book sites will sell magazines online, Amazon

669
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:27,560
does I think. Or since it's a movie magazine they might have it in some like

670
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:34,800
movies. It's a magazine for script writers is what it is. That's cool. Alrighty, let's move on let's go to

671
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,200
another story. Loki, regarding the PlayStation 3, there was some now there

672
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,360
was some back and forth this week right after the conference people were saying

673
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:46,120
oh that hard drives not gonna really come with a system or that's gonna make

674
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:51,360
it make it the $900 system. Loki tell us once and for all what's the deal with a

675
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:56,040
hard drive. It is standard. I mean, it's... of course you're gonna... you need the hard

676
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,840
drive to play the games. They've come out and said that it's not gonna be like the Xbox

677
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:04,320
360 where, okay, if you don't have a hard drive, memory card, that'll just be fine.

678
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:09,960
No, you need the hard drive to play the games. So, of course, it's gonna be standard with

679
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:17,040
the system and it was confirmed by Yahoo Games and, wow, Yahoo Games is actually legitimate.

680
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,860
That's surprising. I think that's a bigger shocker than the knock on them.

681
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:25,380
Yahoo featured our podcast once. Don't hurt our relations there.

682
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:28,620
Oh, I'm sorry.

683
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:32,900
In that case, Yahoo's so smart.

684
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:37,040
Alright, speaking of hard drives, you may remember last week

685
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,020
I called a certain gaming company a bunch of

686
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,460
bastards for this news article. I do want to say one thing real quick.

687
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:47,100
I think it's a great idea that they are including the hard drive, because now developers can

688
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:52,220
develop with the hard drive in mind, unlike the 360.

689
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:57,420
And speaking of the 360, I kind of called Microsoft a bunch of bastards this last week

690
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:01,260
over this news article, and it turned out to be false.

691
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:06,780
The 100 gigabyte hard drive rumor that was going around a couple weeks ago, or actually

692
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:12,640
last week, starting from the Best Buy employee or something, they actually got word officially

693
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:19,280
from Microsoft, from the global marketing team, saying, we haven't announced any additional

694
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:24,480
hard drives for the Xbox 360 beyond the 20GB version available today.

695
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:31,040
So I'd like to offer an apology to Microsoft for calling you guys bastards.

696
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,600
And Halo Rocks, please forgive me.

697
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,920
They're still bastards.

698
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,920
But not for that.

699
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,240
For other things.

700
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,480
Many, many other things.

701
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,820
We can find a reason why all these gaming companies are bastards, though, this way.

702
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:48,520
Nintendo lied, you know, forget it.

703
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,400
Nintendo lied to us.

704
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,320
I feel steep in my soul.

705
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:58,080
Well, you know, Chat Room's saying that we're being too hard on Nintendo, because maybe

706
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,080
that wasn't...

707
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,080
Where did that come from?

708
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:04,400
Nintendo Maniac 64, of course, defending Nintendo, saying, that doesn't mean that's why it was

709
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,400
delayed.

710
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:10,840
I mean, that Zelda thing isn't necessarily the only reason why it was delayed, but come

711
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,840
on.

712
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:16,220
incentive right I think I think back to the Zelda games that were on Game Boy

713
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:19,460
Color and the Game Boy Advance why didn't they come out to the end of Game

714
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:22,880
Boy Color for that exact same reason to transition people on to Game Boy Advance

715
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,820
with one of their biggest franchises I'm not surprised at all I have a question

716
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:32,360
for Nintendo why didn't they give us this to tell of you the best version of

717
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:38,140
Zelda ever all right moving on oh this is this is horrible is that what what's

718
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:43,420
today March March 19th is today's date and we're already having to dispel April

719
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:50,380
Fool's jokes I hate April Fool's I hate it so much it's horrible but of course

720
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:54,620
you know we might have to do something of our own we'll see or we would never

721
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:59,180
do that to you guys but we wouldn't the bad thing is is that all these magazines

722
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:04,820
put their April issues out in mid-march so now there's all these lies coming to

723
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,820
to you from these gaming magazines saying,

724
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,180
oh, it's an April Fool's joke.

725
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,620
God, that sucks, we're on the second.

726
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,300
We were broadcasting on the second.

727
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:14,700
If only one more day we could have fun at that show.

728
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:15,540
No, we'll see.

729
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:18,780
It's like, today we're doing it without a script, woo-hoo!

730
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:20,180
All right, so now we would like to tell you

731
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,900
about some of the real lies being spread this week

732
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:26,400
by gaming magazines under the guise of April Fool's jokes.

733
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,820
Loki, what's the first one?

734
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:31,180
The first one is, I'm not necessarily gonna call this

735
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,580
an April Fool's joke because I'm not really

736
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:39,680
certain if it is. Basically it's some Duke Nukem Forever gameplay footage. It was featured

737
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:45,160
and leaked to the internet I guess. And it looks like an in development version of it.

738
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:50,000
I watched the actual video and it looked pretty convincing to me. I mean it looked like a

739
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:57,800
game in progress. It had the Duke Nukem voice acting in it and it looked like it actually

740
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:02,720
could have been the game. I don't think it's, you know, it might be a mod or something but

741
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:09,080
I don't think it's a real game, but still not real, but Duke Nukem still probably coming out later. All right

742
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,760
Dark Sakura, what's another big lie under the guise of April Fools?

743
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,400
Halo 3

744
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,040
Well, no, we're getting we're gonna get a Halo 3

745
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:24,680
I mean that's inevitable, but there was a rumor that Halo 3 was being called forerunner and it's actually just a April Fools joke

746
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:29,400
There was a post on the Xbox forums with someone calling himself DM duo Maxwell

747
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:34,680
anyone who watches Gundam Wing know who that was who said he transcribed an

748
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:41,080
article about the game from an upcoming issue of Game Informer magazine which is

749
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:47,240
Game Stops big magazine basically said that the game was gonna have huge

750
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:51,840
persistent worlds built around a modified Halo 2 engine that was gonna

751
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:55,920
feature Master Chief and would have a co-op mode for up to four players but

752
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:04,400
But according to Bungie, it's a big pile of poo, to quote, he said, we can't smack him

753
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,560
for an April Fool's gag, not like we never did any.

754
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:12,160
Well, and I've got another, so that was lie number two.

755
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:16,620
Here's another lie, and funny enough, this one involves Halo as well, and it's the April

756
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:18,960
issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly.

757
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:24,540
They are running a lie right now that says, Halo Combat Evolved will appear on the Xbox

758
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:31,860
live marketplace but not actually gonna happen here at least there's at least

759
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:34,980
they're saying here that this is not likely to happen it's probably their

760
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:41,500
April Fool's joke but you logically think whom could Microsoft eventually

761
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:45,040
jump on this bandwagon because you know you got Sony is saying they're gonna do

762
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,360
the same thing with the PlayStation games maybe this isn't such an

763
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:52,340
unrealistic I think you're gonna need a bigger hard drive that's the case hmm

764
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:57,740
interesting well we shall see alright so moving on

765
00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:02,900
let's go let's go from lies to apologies this has been this has been a show full

766
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:03,980
of apologies and lies

767
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:08,740
low-key who's who's saying sorry now Star Force and I wouldn't really say

768
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:09,740
that this is

769
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:14,420
I I don't know there's sort of an apology here Star Force if you guys

770
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:16,780
remember back last week they're the ones that reporting

771
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:19,900
they're the company that's you know does security

772
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:26,100
you know, copy protection software and this, you know, basically they were leaking a torrent

773
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:33,800
of Galactic Civilization 2 on their website just because, you know, Stardock didn't want

774
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,480
to use Star Force's copy protection schemes.

775
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:47,940
So they said, yeah, we're sorry, but it's just like, you know, basically, this is, I

776
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:53,500
I was listening to some other podcasts this week that were talking about this company.

777
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,900
They're really evil.

778
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:59,940
I mean, I never really, because I don't play a lot of PC games, I mean, granted, between

779
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:03,780
Final Fantasy XI and World of Warcraft, that's enough PC games for me, because that's most

780
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:08,880
of my PC game time, but I never really realized, like, they practically install spyware on

781
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,380
your computer, it sounds like.

782
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:11,380
It's kind of fascinating.

783
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:13,460
I'm surprised they get away with it.

784
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:20,740
So basically they apologized for the incident and said they took down the link, but it's

785
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:21,740
just like...

786
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:22,740
Yeah, I know.

787
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:23,740
Too little too late.

788
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:24,740
It's still pretty rotten to be doing that.

789
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:26,620
Too little too late.

790
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:29,500
You know, here's the thing guys, if you don't, and I see a lot of people in our chat room

791
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,140
right now are going, yeah, F them, they suck, duh duh duh.

792
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,480
Here it is guys, vote with your dollars.

793
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,500
If you don't like this company, don't buy anything that their product is involved with.

794
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:39,780
End of story.

795
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:42,560
And then soon you will no longer see them because they'll go out of business because

796
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:43,960
nobody's buying their stuff

797
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,480
vote with your dollars you don't like it

798
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,900
or let the publishers that are using this kind of cop protection scheme know

799
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:53,880
that you're not gonna buy their game because of this

800
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,580
uh... moving on

801
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,180
dark sakura

802
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:58,720
we talked about sega earlier

803
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,060
yes cuz i love sega

804
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:02,200
well here's something that's kinda might be

805
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,200
sad with sega but it's a rumor right?

806
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:08,760
well yeah there's been indicators that Yuji Naka is quitting sega

807
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:12,000
he's basically the head of a sonic team

808
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,360
Wow. I love Sonic Team!

809
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,640
My god, do we know anything about why he's doing this or anything?

810
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:22,880
There's a speculation that he's going to be creating his own

811
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,360
company that may be aligned with Sega but that's

812
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:31,040
again speculation. This is the man that brought us Sonic the Hedgehog

813
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,160
and Phantasy Star Online, Knights.

814
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,860
So pretty much like all the great Sega games you start to think about, this guy

815
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:41,880
made them. Yuji Naka is the man. That would be like Miyamoto

816
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:47,940
leaving Nintendo, in a way. Me and Meadow left Nintendo and Nintendo would crumble.

817
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:55,260
But Sega's already, I'm sorry, Sammy Sega. I have to say Sammy Sega. Then again Sammy

818
00:48:55,260 --> 00:49:02,940
did bring us Guilty Gear, so. But you know, still, Sega, having something like this even

819
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:09,380
be rumored just sort of makes me think how the mighty have fallen. I know, I'll be...

820
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:12,540
They're not going to have a Sega in 20 years if they keep this up.

821
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:15,700
You know what's interesting though, because we have so many stories tonight about companies

822
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:18,740
buying each other out, and I think they're not coming up until part B, but we have so

823
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:22,180
many stories about companies buying each other, it's kind of interesting to hear that one

824
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:26,180
might be, because essentially you take some of the biggest brains at Sega and split it

825
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:30,680
off, that's almost like now a company's split, so that's kind of, you know, a little interesting

826
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:31,680
to me.

827
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,260
I guess it's just business, just another day in the gaming business, boys and girls.

828
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:38,940
I'll have to go home and hook up the Saturn in the morning.

829
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:39,940
Well, we'll see.

830
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:40,940
It hasn't happened yet.

831
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:41,940
It hasn't happened yet, but we'll see.

832
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:44,780
I just mean for the greatness that Sega was.

833
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:45,780
Alright.

834
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:50,220
Um, Loki, here's something else to mourn about.

835
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,980
Dark Sakura, put this on your list of things to talk about when you're mourning.

836
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:55,260
What do we have to mourn over as well?

837
00:49:55,260 --> 00:50:00,020
Well, you know, it was a good run or a roll, I should say.

838
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:06,860
The Katamari team has broken up, and so we're not going to be seeing any more Katamari games.

839
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:08,320
How do you know this?

840
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:15,260
Because the website says so, katamaridomasi.jp.

841
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:19,500
There was a three-day countdown, and people were anticipating, oh hey, there was a countdown

842
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:23,260
last time it was the announcement of me and my Katamari.

843
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:24,260
Now it's...

844
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,260
No.

845
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:27,660
We're done.

846
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:30,380
Maybe it's a really bad April Fool's joke?

847
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:35,300
Well, the creator of Katamari Damacy himself has said he doesn't like video games.

848
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:38,820
Wasn't he going to go make a kid's playground or something?

849
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:40,820
Playground equipment, yep.

850
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:42,260
That's weird.

851
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:46,580
But where there's money to be made and Katamari is still a successful franchise, don't you

852
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:53,580
think Namco might try and say, oh well, if they all left, we'll do something ourselves?

853
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:55,660
Is that possible?

854
00:50:55,660 --> 00:51:00,060
Or do you think they'll respect the wishes to not continue that franchise?

855
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:04,660
I think the problem with that being is that even if they decide to try to keep going with

856
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:08,660
it, it's not going to have the same feeling that the games now do.

857
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:14,420
When you, it's sort of like, when you have a recipe and you have it at the same restaurant

858
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:18,300
and then another restaurant tries to copy it, it just doesn't taste the same way.

859
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,900
It's the same thing.

860
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,180
Interesting.

861
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:27,640
You know and at the same time you can kind of maybe respect this decision honestly because

862
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:33,140
part of the problem with games today as it is that Katamari Damacy kind of really went

863
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:37,040
against the grain with this when it first came out is that too damn many sequels, too

864
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:42,520
many copies of other games, too many of the same thing and Katamari Damacy was well respected

865
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:47,400
for breaking that mold so I think maybe this is why they've decided to quit now before

866
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:52,200
they become the thing that they were representative against.

867
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:55,440
So at that time, you kind of have to respect them.

868
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:00,600
I just hope that at least these guys will put out more games of some type, and even

869
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:04,940
if it's not another Katamari Damacy game, you've got to admit that sense of humor that's

870
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:10,020
in Katamari Damacy, that level that the music is at and all that stuff, that could lend

871
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:12,580
itself great to another very original concept.

872
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:17,940
So I hope we see many of the brains behind Team Katamari, even if they broke up, many

873
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:24,020
of the same big minds behind it create something new that can be the Katamari Damacy of next

874
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:25,020
year.

875
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:26,020
So we'll see.

876
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:30,600
Or just, I don't know, just get part of the development team and start a new team.

877
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:34,260
It doesn't take the same minds to create the game, they didn't really change much from

878
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:38,420
both games anyways, I mean, I don't know.

879
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:43,620
comments from our chat room, Arsef says, yeah, too many sequels would defeat the inventiveness

880
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:44,740
of the series.

881
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:48,700
Xander C says, I hope he makes more games, but hopefully it will be original stuff.

882
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:50,860
No more Katamari, please.

883
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:52,140
So there you have it.

884
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:55,900
So maybe fans are just kind of accepting this, that yep, you know what, this is what you

885
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:57,820
got to do to stay original.

886
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:02,360
All right, well, you know, at the same time we can be original, we can also celebrate

887
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:03,360
the classics.

888
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:06,860
Now you guys know the walk of game down at the Metreon in San Francisco, and of course

889
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:08,960
Of course now, the metronome was just sold recently.

890
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,400
We don't know how this is going to affect the walk of game, but they just recently had

891
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:17,280
their 2006 ceremony where they inducted John Carmack, who was the technical director at

892
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:23,740
ID Software, Doomquake, Sid Meier, Civilization among many other things.

893
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:25,160
That guy is honestly a god to me.

894
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:28,500
Sid Meier has made some of the greatest PC games of all time.

895
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,680
They were lifetime achievement guys.

896
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:35,280
Also some games that were celebrated for their characters as well as being a game, EverQuest,

897
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:40,880
Final Fantasy, Lara Croft, and Starcraft all being inducted into the Walk of Game, which

898
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,420
I have yet to really see, so I might have to take a trip to the Metreon before it gets,

899
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:48,120
you know, turned into the Mega Mall that Westfield might turn it into.

900
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:51,920
I kind of am hoping that maybe Westfield won't screw it up and they'll try to still keep

901
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,800
it like a gaming center, like make it appeal to gamers, that would make me a happy, happy

902
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:57,800
kid.

903
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,480
They'll put an EB in there as well, or GameStop.

904
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,340
But they have the official Sony store, so that would be kind of competing, so I don't

905
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,340
know if they could do that.

906
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:08,440
But I'd like to see them try, you know, maybe like a, because they have, what do they have

907
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:09,440
in there?

908
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,460
They have the comic store and they have that in there, so maybe like a gaming store for

909
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:19,300
like gaming culture where they sell like the magazines and, you know, shirts and stuff.

910
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:23,320
And since this won't be Sony specific, why not lure Nintendo and Microsoft to try and

911
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,140
do some stores in here as well, you know?

912
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:27,480
Still need the Sega Land theme park.

913
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,840
Why not Sega come open a store?

914
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:32,240
Some of the third-party developers kind of sell off some of their big things.

915
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:36,440
Gamco could have a store, you know, all this, a Konami store, would be kind of cool.

916
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:40,940
I bet in five years it's going to turn into a Pokemon Center.

917
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:43,680
Why not open up a Pokemon Center in it somewhere, you know?

918
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,640
Because Pokemon Centers are evil!

919
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:49,080
But some, you know what, some people like it, so why not have it for them as well, you

920
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,320
know, something for everybody.

921
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,460
I think that would be cool to keep it like a gaming themed place.

922
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:58,120
Some people worship the devil too, but that doesn't make it right.

923
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,120
Oh snap.

924
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,240
People are entitled to their own religion.

925
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:05,560
Speaking of people worshipping the devil, a certain game franchise has turned 25 this

926
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:08,760
week and we're not sure how this franchise keeps going.

927
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:12,600
So maybe it is Divine Darkness Intervention or something.

928
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,260
Frogger has turned 25.

929
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:20,480
Don't get me wrong, Frogger is a wonderful game 25 years ago, but these recent releases...

930
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:21,480
Wait this way.

931
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:22,480
Not so great.

932
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,240
The original Frogger was a really good game.

933
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,260
Every other Frogger game or game that has Frogger in the title...

934
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:32,300
Wait, wait, wait, actually I had a game on Commodore 64 called Frogger 2

935
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:36,060
3 Deep that was kind of neat and that's it.

936
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:39,940
Then after that I'll back up what you're saying.

937
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:45,060
Frogger, um, yeah pretty much Frogger nowadays

938
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:49,020
is just, you see Frogger on a game or Frogger like helmet chaos

939
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:53,660
you're like, wow, crap. That's what that is, it's crap.

940
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:59,180
Nope. I mean, not much you can really do with Frogger. It's such a simple game.

941
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:01,780
Well, they still have another game coming out. Well, now it's more...

942
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:05,540
I played the Frogger that they came out with on PlayStation. I think that was

943
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:07,700
about the last time I played a Frogger game because

944
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:10,880
I just wasn't into it. It wasn't that great, you know?

945
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,060
Yeah, now they're trying to get like a storyline. No.

946
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:17,940
No, no, no. It's just a goddamn game.

947
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:22,820
I think Frogger, like, would be a good game on Xbox Live

948
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:27,420
arcade but do it like super ultra realistic like have it look like a real

949
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:28,040
frog

950
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:31,160
have the traffic look real that would be cool

951
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:34,960
multiplayer might be kinda fun like a race to the end I want to be the driver

952
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,800
you should be able to push there you go think about the innovation there with

953
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:42,160
Pac-Man and like you know on that Pac-Man vs. some people could be the

954
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:42,760
ghosts

955
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:46,040
why not have some people be the drivers on Frogger

956
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:51,520
or have your frog with the ability to push other frogs in front of the car

957
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,520
That would be excellent.

958
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,520
Someone needs to play the crocodile.

959
00:56:55,520 --> 00:57:01,520
You know what? Konami, you guys need to hire us to develop, to breathe some new life into your Frogger franchise.

960
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,520
Seriously?

961
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:11,520
Well, you know what? Maybe there's another way to breathe life into the Frogger franchise and some people are trying to imitate this in real life. What's this about?

962
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:19,520
What do you get when you combine lots of alcohol, a Roomba, and something that looks like a frog?

963
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:26,520
Well, you get real life Frogger. Basically, they have taken this Bluetooth-enabled Roomba,

964
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:33,720
a green t-shirt, and lots of alcohol, and they made it cross traffic. They made it cross

965
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:42,800
a four-lane highway about ten times before it got run over by a Toyota 4Runner. And to

966
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:47,200
be honest, this is way more entertaining than any of those Frogger games that have come

967
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:52,560
out recently. I would do this. This would be something I would totally do. And this

968
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:56,580
is excellent. There was actually something sort of similar

969
00:57:56,580 --> 00:58:03,580
that they did in New York City where they did, using a GPS satellite, did Pac-Man.

970
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:11,560
Had a person dressed up with a big Pac-Man outfit and people dressed up as ghosts.

971
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:15,080
You know in a future episode we need to do another list list and games I would like to

972
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:18,700
see imitated in real life. We need to think about that one. Maybe next week if we have

973
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:19,660
time. We'll see.

974
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:20,620
We'll have to.

975
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:23,720
That's a brilliant idea. My hat's off to those kids who put that together.

976
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:24,720
We're ready for booze.

977
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:31,680
I guess. Yeah, wow. All right. Moving on to another story, we're going to go over to Dark

978
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:37,320
Sakura, who's got some news from the UK. What's going on with our buddies overseas this week?

979
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,320
Dark Sakura?

980
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:41,240
Well, it's from all over, but mostly UK stuff.

981
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:42,240
Okay.

982
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:47,880
Tecmo has a new automatic update for the Xbox 360 for Dead or Alive 4.

983
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:55,280
It's meant to adjust some of the interface and balance the characters, tweaking the launcher

984
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:59,800
moves, stun moves, sweeps, a few of the character speeds are changed, some sped up, some slowed

985
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,080
down.

986
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:12,000
Some of the power moves do less damage, encouraging players to be more skillful.

987
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:17,320
When you download the update, you will also have the option to reset your battle tactics,

988
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:21,520
but your zac money, avatars, all that will still be the same.

989
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,880
The DOA4 update is available on Xbox Live.

990
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:28,280
I wonder if it will make the last boss less of a cheap bitch.

991
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,200
Cause she is!

992
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,320
I know.

993
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:36,440
I honestly haven't really super duper played a whole lot of Dead or Alive 4, and I've been

994
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:39,880
too afraid to play online cause I'll sit and watch some of those battles and I'll go like,

995
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:42,460
you know, I'm gonna get my ass kicked.

996
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:44,780
I need to play with people on my own level.

997
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:46,000
Where are the, like,

998
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,840
handicap players on Xbox Live? Why aren't you ever on? Those people who,

999
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:53,400
you know, who need a handicap on their game because they're not very good.

1000
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:56,680
That's what I need. I can admit it. I'm not great at every game.

1001
00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:00,320
I was talking to somebody recently online who assumed that, you know, because

1002
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:03,880
I did this show every week, that I'm good at every video game. That's so not the case.

1003
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:05,560
There's some games I'm good at,

1004
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:08,000
I'll admit. You know, I'm pretty good at a lot of puzzle games.

1005
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,200
but you know not every game please no I mean if you

1006
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:14,440
if you're gonna add me to Xbox Live if you dig through the Orange Lingerie forums

1007
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,120
and decide to add me to Xbox Live

1008
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:19,220
be prepared that I'm not gonna be much of a challenge in some of the games

1009
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:23,000
in other games it's on I will kick your butt on some of those arcade games

1010
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,120
we'll see

1011
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:27,560
Rob needs food badly

1012
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:31,520
not Gauntlet, Gauntlet was more fun for me when I was a kid

1013
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:34,400
I find it to be too repetitive now

1014
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,600
but I think I think our webmaster VX JasonXV

1015
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,360
I think he challenged me to Root Beer Tapper when that one comes out on live.

1016
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:42,440
So you're on, bitch! You're on!

1017
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,980
You have to let us know how that one goes.

1018
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:46,600
We'll see.

1019
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:50,220
2K Games has announced that Civ City Rome,

1020
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:53,720
it's a building strategy based on civilization,

1021
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:56,740
is currently in development for PC.

1022
01:00:56,740 --> 01:01:00,820
It's being produced by Firefly Studios. They brought a Stronghold

1023
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:03,580
and with Firaxis Games.

1024
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:06,940
and according to two k games it's going to have uh...

1025
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:11,820
the most detailed look at roman life ever depicted on a computer screen

1026
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:12,640
that's a quote

1027
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:13,700
that is

1028
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:17,580
until the sieves come out and then you know then you'll have your nice roman

1029
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:20,560
family that you've got a you know

1030
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,660
yeah i got no visit to the

1031
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:26,460
you know annual orgy and

1032
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:30,680
we don't greek or roman here i don't know that roman i know i know

1033
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:33,800
but it was also Greek.

1034
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:36,840
Anyway, moving on from orgies,

1035
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:41,120
you'll start off with a small settlement built until you have an imperial city,

1036
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:44,200
you can have amphitheaters, legionnaire forts, weapon

1037
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:48,480
workshops, circuses, gladiator school,

1038
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:51,600
a whole bunch of stuff, and then you can set it on fire.

1039
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:55,360
Really, you get to burn your city in a day?

1040
01:01:55,360 --> 01:02:00,240
You could. Cool. So this is like most civilization games, you know,

1041
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:04,360
Start small, get big, take over world, repeat.

1042
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:08,980
There are screenshots available, which I will be posting in our chat room, but these can

1043
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:14,040
be seen from, if you go to Eurogamer.net, the links are there.

1044
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:21,840
And actually, I've looked this through, it's very pretty, very, very pretty.

1045
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:27,760
Lots of, you can have ports, one of those captures is of a port city.

1046
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,360
You've got orchards.

1047
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:34,560
You have a huge, massive city with a coliseum.

1048
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:36,920
Oh, that does look pretty neat.

1049
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:37,920
You know...

1050
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,420
I'm going to link this in our chat.

1051
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:44,320
Sometimes PC gaming doesn't necessarily get the respect it deserves, and I know there's

1052
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:48,800
a lot of hardcore PC gamers out there, and I can understand why, because it's a certain

1053
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:53,880
niche of games that really seem to do very well on the PC, but despite all these next-gen

1054
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:57,780
consoles coming out, PC games really tend to stay on top of all that stuff.

1055
01:02:57,780 --> 01:03:02,360
Of course, when you consider that the next-gen consoles are just souped-up PCs and that you

1056
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:07,380
usually have to upgrade your PCs to play the latest games, it all kind of makes sense.

1057
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:08,700
It's still kind of neat, I guess.

1058
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:15,760
Well, what my hope is for games like this is that we see an actual degree of historical

1059
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:21,340
accuracy in it, you know, because I think that, okay, I'm sure that a lot of the people

1060
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:26,860
People who know me off the show know I have a very big interest in anthropology and ancient

1061
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:28,100
history.

1062
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:33,980
I think something like this not only would be good for the whole strategy, building side

1063
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:38,540
of things, but also a chance to offer a little bit of a history lesson.

1064
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:41,460
Civilization was pretty good with that because the world leaders that you would come across

1065
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:45,340
would be kind of like how they were at their time.

1066
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:49,820
The folks that took over the world via war were very war-centric in the game, and the

1067
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:54,360
people who were leaders in politics were very, you know, politics center. So, you know, they've

1068
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:58,320
got a track record over there of being... you can learn at least a little something

1069
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:00,120
from your games, and that's always good.

1070
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:03,280
I think that they should be educational at the same time.

1071
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:04,280
All right.

1072
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:09,480
But, you know, though, on the same topic, there's Civ IV's getting an expansion.

1073
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:14,800
Oh, very cool. You know, I still haven't played Civ IV. I feel really bad. It's just, you

1074
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:17,840
know, it's one of those things where it's like, I just don't have the time to play everything

1075
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:22,080
I want to play I really want to try this out sometime. Well, the expansion is called

1076
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,720
civilization for warlords

1077
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:29,640
With new units that are called warlords. Mm-hmm. It'll have some of the greatest

1078
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:33,960
military leader leaders and new scenarios you can change history

1079
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:39,120
You can take control of ancient Chinese Kingdom fight in the Peloponnesian Wars

1080
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:41,900
You can join Alexander the Great

1081
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:46,480
Become ruler of the Vikings pillage Europe. Hmm. That's kind of cool

1082
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:48,480
You can you can be Genghis Khan

1083
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:52,200
That's kind of cool. Yeah, you know and um

1084
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:00,920
Honestly, maybe I should just wait until all the expansions for Civ 4 are out because then there'll be that gold box set because there's

1085
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:06,440
Always a gold box set at the end of every civilizations lifespan. That's like 20 bucks that has everything in it

1086
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,760
So maybe I'm okay waiting. We'll see

1087
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:11,720
Alexander the Great in this game looks kind of

1088
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:14,720
historically accurate.

1089
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,720
Let's just leave it at that.

1090
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,720
For those of us who have studied a little bit of history.

1091
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,720
Alright, anything else?

1092
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:24,720
Well, I'm also posting that clip in the chatroom.

We have active war high treason for the pc out by atari final fight street wise

1104

Yay, you know which i'm gonna have to get because I collect the final fight games

1105
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,600
I actually found my copy of final fight guy the other day

1106
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:12,000
Oh, that's cool. That was my favorite.

1107
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,200
I know, I never had it. Oh, anyway, sorry. Okay, sorry.

1108
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:18,400
Um, Ice Age 2, the Meltdown video game.

01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:42,760
the yellow avenger yay street racing syndicate elder scrolls for oblivion

1115
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:45,480
the godfather worms open warfare

1116
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:49,760
alright so that's what's on the UK's plate

1117
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:53,880
and of course we'd like to take it back to the US with what's on the US's plate

1118
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,240
Loki what are we getting this week

1119
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:59,320
we're looking at elder scrolls for oblivion of course

1120
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:03,080
finally coming out for the 360

1121
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:06,920
that's this week? I completely forgot that was this week oh my gosh

1122
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:12,760
Yes, me and my Katamari, of course, got like a, you know, that's going to be awesome.

1123
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:16,760
Milgir Acid 2, really good.

1124
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:17,760
What else was really good?

1125
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:21,040
Tao's Curse of the Demon, remember that one from...

1126
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:26,360
Yeah, I don't know, only if you're a hardcore role-playing game person, otherwise skippable.

1127
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:29,680
The Godfather, it's really sweet.

1128
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:36,280
Worms Open Warfare on NDS and PSP, which is going to be really sweet.

1129
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:42,880
And then, of course, Blazing Angels on Xbox and Xbox 360, which is also really cool.

1130
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:47,940
And Capcom Classics Collection remixed on the PSP, which includes Captain Commando and

1131
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:49,600
Street Fighter and Strider.

1132
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:50,600
Funny...

1133
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:51,600
Strider!

1134
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:54,800
Aren't Tetris DS and Metroid Prime Hunters this week too?

1135
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:55,800
I was getting there.

1136
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:56,800
Oh, sorry.

1137
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:58,240
You had that finished look on your face.

1138
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,240
No, no, no.

1139
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:00,240
No.

1140
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:03,160
Of course, Metroid Prime Hunters and Tetris DS played that this week.

1141
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:07,420
And as I mentioned, I think I said The Godfather, of course.

1142
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:09,960
There was a Tetris DS commercial on TV this week.

1143
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,400
Some of the gaming sites picked it up, but I actually saw it for the first time, like,

1144
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,160
I was watching some show and they aired it.

1145
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,160
It's kind of funny.

1146
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:16,160
How did I forget?

1147
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:19,160
Karaoke Revolution Country is coming out this week.

1148
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:22,040
Oh, hooray!

1149
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:23,800
And of course next week, BeatMania.

1150
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:25,900
You know what, this is a huge week for games.

1151
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:26,900
It really is.

1152
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:31,120
I mean, at least the kind of games that we play, it sounds like, you know, I'm like,

1153
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:33,260
Oh my God, my wallet's gonna hurt this week.

1154
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:35,120
I mean, right there, you name like four games

1155
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:35,960
I wanna pick up.

1156
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:39,440
Me and My Katamari, Tetris DS, Prime Hunters, and Oblivion.

1157
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:40,600
I want all those games.

1158
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:43,920
And honestly though, the price of the first three combined

1159
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,520
will probably be the same as Oblivion,

1160
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:46,920
so I'll probably just pick up the first three

1161
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:48,740
and wait a little bit to hear the reviews

1162
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:49,580
of Elder Scrolls a little more.

1163
01:08:49,580 --> 01:08:50,420
How about this?

1164
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:52,400
How about you just see my copy of Oblivion

1165
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:53,240
when I buy it this week?

1166
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:54,440
Here we go, and then maybe you could borrow

1167
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:56,600
my copy of Me and My Katamari or something,

1168
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,560
which reminds me, I want that PSV back.

1169
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:02,800
You will get your PSP back. I have a funny story about your adapter.

1170
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:06,400
Oh? Well, I loaned a Guanagirl my camera

1171
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:11,160
and I gave her your adapter with it. Because it looked like the one for my camera.

1172
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:15,320
I'll get it back. Guanagirl, if you're listening,

1173
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:18,480
I want that back. Or I'm sending out the hitman.

1174
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:23,160
I got my camera back. I'm teasing, it's all good. That's cool. I just don't have your adapter.

1175
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:27,560
Whatever. I also, real quick, since we were just on the UK news, we

1176
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:30,760
We actually have one of our UK listeners tuned in tonight, Simmel.

1177
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:34,240
Now that's hardcore, to be listening live when you're living in a different time zone,

1178
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:36,000
because I know we've had in the past...

1179
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,400
It's 3 a.m. there.

1180
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:38,400
That's wow.

1181
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:41,880
And we've had folks from Australia listen live too, and I know that's more like afternoon

1182
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:45,520
time, but that's awesome that you guys are tuning in and listening live in those different

1183
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:46,520
time zones.

1184
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:47,520
Hooray for our fellow night owls.

1185
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:48,520
That's awesome.

1186
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:54,240
Man, I just wouldn't want to have to calculate the time zones, that's all.

1187
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:56,920
Too much brain worky.

1188
01:09:56,920 --> 01:10:02,720
I moderate the UK site. I think our streaming site Live 365 will

1189
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:06,720
auto-calculate on the scheduler. Like if you go to look at our scheduler of live programs

1190
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:10,080
it will auto-calculate the times for you, I think.

1191
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:15,400
So check that out on our station page. Okay. For UK, add five hours. For France,

1192
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:19,880
add one or two more hours. Anyways, as I was going to mention, I was

1193
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:24,720
going to mention real quickly next week, which is really cool, BeatMania, Kingdom Hearts

1194
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:25,720
too.

1195
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:26,720
Oh, God.

1196
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:27,720
See, this end...

1197
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:28,720
What is up with the end of...

1198
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:31,240
Is the end of March usually this big of a gaming time?

1199
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:32,240
I don't remember this last year.

1200
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:34,640
It drops off next month, so let me put it that way.

1201
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,920
And of course, more stuff for me.

1202
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:39,920
Far Cry Instinct's Predator and Rumble Roses.

1203
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:44,720
I think it's excellent that all this stuff is coming out right before my birthday.

1204
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:46,680
Yeah, convenient for you.

1205
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:47,680
Oh, yes.

1206
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:51,000
Well, at least convenient for those of us that might have a hard time thinking of a

1207
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,960
gift for you otherwise, though, is it, you know...

1208
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:55,960
So the problem is, what if you end up with like, you know, 40 copies of Kingdom Hearts

1209
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:56,960
2?

1210
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:57,960
GameStop gift certificates, baby.

1211
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:02,280
I'm going to buy you the Game Boy Advance version of Cats, which is coming out.

1212
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:06,200
Yes, and I'm going to buy that SpongeBob SquarePants yellow adventure game for you, because you

1213
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:07,200
should love that.

1214
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:10,040
I could use it for Shermie's litter box, thank you.

1215
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:11,040
Alright.

1216
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:14,520
For those who don't know, Shermie is my cat.

1217
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:15,520
That's right.

1218
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:16,520
There we go.

1219
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:17,880
Named after a video game character.

1220
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:18,880
Which one?

1221
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:19,880
I don't...

1222
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:20,880
Shermie from King of Fighters!

1223
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:21,880
Okay, quick story.

1224
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:25,560
really play a lot of her name on the adoption paper with Sherman I said that

1225
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:29,520
that sucks for a female cat so he called her Shermy with the video game tie-in

1226
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:34,240
for she's the one who does the dancing moves on Kimurochi. I didn't play a lot of King of Fighters I played the

1227
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:46,320
Final... Final... Fatal Fury! Why do I keep wanting to say Final? Final Fury! I have Fatal Fury 2 on EOGO. I remember Fatal Fury Special that was cool

1228
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:51,520
cuz every special is hot return of duck King it's awesome art of fighting art of

1229
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:54,360
fighting was pretty cool too that was the one that had like King in it and

1230
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:59,600
stuff yeah with the zoom ins yeah no classic Street Fighter 2 rip off I show

1231
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:06,040
down well because okay all right Ken and Ryu were ripped off for art of fighting

1232
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:12,440
with Rio and Robert Robert and then I remember Capcom to make fun of them came

1233
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:21,800
up with Dan Hibiki in Street Fighter who wears a gi like Rio and has Robert Garcia's hair.

1234
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,280
I never made that connection.

1235
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:24,280
It's awesome.

1236
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:25,280
It's true.

1237
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:28,280
See, I used to play as Rob in Art of Fighting because, you know, he's got a good name.

1238
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:29,280
Yeah.

1239
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:30,280
There you go.

1240
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:33,680
All right, anyway, it is time to go ahead and break for this half of our show.

1241
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:37,480
We will be back with a little more Orange Lounge Radio after the break.
