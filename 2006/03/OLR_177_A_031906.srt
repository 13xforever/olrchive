00:00:14,104 --> 00:00:25,243
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, March 19th, 2006, a barrage of updates on the PlayStation 3, we dispel April Fool's rumors already hitting the internet, and do we really have to say goodbye to Katamari Damacy?

2
00:00:32,765 --> 00:00:35,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome everybody to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:35,967 --> 00:00:38,949
[SPEAKER_02]: We're here to give you the news that gamers really want to know about.

4
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,491
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

5
00:00:41,551 --> 00:00:45,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining me as always, say hello to my awesome co-host, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:45,874 --> 00:00:45,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Yo.

7
00:00:46,054 --> 00:00:46,834
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?

8
00:00:47,455 --> 00:00:47,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Full.

9
00:00:48,175 --> 00:00:48,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Full?

10
00:00:48,536 --> 00:00:49,556
[SPEAKER_02]: You just ate before the show?

11
00:00:49,936 --> 00:00:52,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I had my usual burrito.

12
00:00:52,798 --> 00:00:53,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

13
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:53,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Of doom.

14
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:55,880
[SPEAKER_02]: What makes it a burrito of doom?

15
00:00:56,701 --> 00:00:58,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it blessed by the Dark Lord Satan or what?

16
00:00:59,082 --> 00:00:59,843
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding, I don't know.

17
00:01:00,425 --> 00:01:03,267
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, Satan decided not to bless my burrito.

18
00:01:03,447 --> 00:01:04,068
[SPEAKER_02]: I see, alright.

19
00:01:05,929 --> 00:01:07,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Also say hello to our tech master, Loki.

20
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:08,471
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.

21
00:01:08,491 --> 00:01:09,151
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?

22
00:01:09,872 --> 00:01:10,392
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good.

23
00:01:10,432 --> 00:01:11,953
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a Got Milk commercial.

24
00:01:11,973 --> 00:01:15,576
[SPEAKER_00]: I have all that chocolate from those brownie bites.

25
00:01:15,836 --> 00:01:16,136
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.

26
00:01:17,317 --> 00:01:20,139
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like two weeks in a row that we've had those brownie bites here.

27
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,121
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I went to Starbucks to go buy them, but they only had two.

28
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:32,312
[SPEAKER_00]: They were also out of white mocha, which I don't really care because I don't drink coffee, but Nellie wanted a white mocha, so.

29
00:01:32,832 --> 00:01:34,253
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had to hear all that complaining?

30
00:01:35,273 --> 00:01:35,694
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, no.

31
00:01:36,234 --> 00:01:37,394
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, I don't know.

32
00:01:37,895 --> 00:01:38,675
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like Starbucks.

33
00:01:40,135 --> 00:01:40,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, what's that?

34
00:01:40,636 --> 00:01:41,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yay, brownie.

35
00:01:41,816 --> 00:01:44,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, we're here on this episode number 177 for this.

36
00:01:46,331 --> 00:02:04,038
[SPEAKER_02]: March 19th of 2006 and we got a lot of news to go into tonight so let's just start getting into the show we always started off talking about how our gaming week was the kinds of games we played this week little mini reviews on stuff we've looked into and just so you know that we're gamers too you know DarkSakura what you been doing this week

37
00:02:06,364 --> 00:02:09,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, a lot of Animal Crossing again, just because it's what I can play at work.

38
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,249
[SPEAKER_04]: The rest of my time has been spent doing school stuff.

39
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:24,197
[SPEAKER_04]: However, my husband has told me that I'm getting a PSP of my very own soon because of a certain case that will be associated with a certain game.

40
00:02:25,758 --> 00:02:26,319
[SPEAKER_02]: What's this?

41
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:32,283
[SPEAKER_04]: For me and my Katamari, apparently there's a case being released that's in the shape of the prince's head.

42
00:02:33,106 --> 00:02:35,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I think I saw a picture of that somewhere.

43
00:02:35,507 --> 00:02:38,768
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it was a custom thing or the official one, but I know I've seen a picture of a PSP.

44
00:02:38,828 --> 00:02:42,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's got to be official if it's being shipped to GameStop.

45
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:48,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I know, but I'm wondering if the picture I saw was the official one or a fan one, because you know fans probably did one, too, before that.

46
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Animal Crossing I noticed a lot of people...

47
00:03:17,307 --> 00:03:17,787
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on and so forth.

48
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,041
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

49
00:04:04,247 --> 00:04:10,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I think it's slightly harder, but then again, I've been playing it on the micro, where it's like really, really tiny.

50
00:04:11,091 --> 00:04:15,614
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's why I won't get a micro, because my eyesight's borderline bad enough.

51
00:04:16,655 --> 00:04:17,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Mine was a gift.

52
00:04:19,622 --> 00:04:20,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Puzzle games.

53
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:23,683
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what puzzle game never really came out for a home console that kind of made me sad?

54
00:04:23,983 --> 00:04:27,344
[SPEAKER_02]: They used to have this game at Golfland Local Arcade, the Battle Balls.

55
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:31,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ever play that with the marbles that you had to stack like four in a row?

56
00:04:31,266 --> 00:04:32,026
[SPEAKER_04]: I never played that.

57
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:32,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it was kind of fun.

58
00:04:33,086 --> 00:04:34,167
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an import game.

59
00:04:34,227 --> 00:04:35,567
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that a Capcom game?

60
00:04:36,247 --> 00:04:36,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it?

61
00:04:37,047 --> 00:04:38,128
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

62
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,789
[SPEAKER_04]: What about, oh shoot, what was that one?

63
00:04:41,109 --> 00:04:41,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Magical Drop.

64
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:45,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Magical Drop kind of had like a resurgence.

65
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,341
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get that on your phone.

66
00:04:46,381 --> 00:04:47,861
[SPEAKER_02]: I had Magical Drop on my cell phone.

67
00:04:47,901 --> 00:04:48,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Go figure.

68
00:04:48,582 --> 00:04:49,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Crazy.

69
00:04:49,542 --> 00:04:52,303
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got Magical Drop on an EOGO CD.

70
00:04:52,684 --> 00:04:55,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, that's the way to do it if you want to do it authentic.

71
00:04:55,725 --> 00:04:58,086
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm pretty sure Magical Drop also existed.

72
00:04:58,926 --> 00:05:02,388
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say there was a version of it on Super Nintendo, but please don't quote me on that.

73
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,069
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that they did one actually for the Pocket.

74
00:05:05,109 --> 00:05:06,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, probably.

75
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably because it was an SNK game.

76
00:05:08,571 --> 00:05:08,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

77
00:05:09,073 --> 00:05:09,974
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

78
00:05:32,903 --> 00:05:35,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wait, that's totally not true.

79
00:05:35,846 --> 00:05:37,868
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't send me gifts, but I got one in person.

80
00:05:37,908 --> 00:05:41,611
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a pretty big one in person not that long ago, so I can't say that.

81
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:42,152
[SPEAKER_02]: My bad.

82
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,313
[SPEAKER_04]: I also found a very interesting book.

83
00:05:45,194 --> 00:05:53,642
[SPEAKER_04]: I was at Barnes & Noble last night, and there was a retro magazine that they did with the Super R-Type on the cover.

84
00:05:53,662 --> 00:05:54,562
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, yeah!

85
00:05:54,622 --> 00:05:56,164
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a gaming retro magazine?

86
00:05:56,544 --> 00:05:56,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

87
00:05:56,904 --> 00:05:57,565
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of rad.

88
00:05:57,745 --> 00:05:58,286
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that.

89
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:05,562
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also another book that was something about writing and poetry spawned from old video games.

90
00:06:06,482 --> 00:06:09,744
[SPEAKER_04]: It was one of the end cap books in the fantasy section that made me laugh.

91
00:06:09,824 --> 00:06:10,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Haikus?

92
00:06:11,944 --> 00:06:13,025
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it was a haiku book.

93
00:06:13,045 --> 00:06:15,986
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what we should have on OrangeSongsRadio.com is a haiku forum.

94
00:06:18,686 --> 00:06:20,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, great video game.

95
00:06:20,587 --> 00:06:22,648
[SPEAKER_04]: How I love thee so much.

96
00:06:23,288 --> 00:06:24,568
[SPEAKER_04]: I play you all day.

97
00:06:24,588 --> 00:06:26,089
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful.

98
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:26,769
[SPEAKER_02]: I was moved.

99
00:06:27,597 --> 00:06:30,580
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually was right too.

100
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,522
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw your fingers tapping as you were talking.

101
00:06:34,303 --> 00:06:35,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else you want to share about your week?

102
00:06:36,365 --> 00:06:37,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Ouch.

103
00:06:37,466 --> 00:06:38,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

104
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:40,609
[SPEAKER_00]: My week was okay.

105
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:44,692
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been playing a lot of the Xbox stuff.

106
00:06:44,892 --> 00:06:49,016
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought The Outfit and I played that for about half an hour.

107
00:06:49,356 --> 00:06:50,077
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of cool.

108
00:06:50,257 --> 00:06:51,938
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really gotten in the back.

109
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:53,520
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to finish up

110
00:06:54,212 --> 00:07:20,793
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the rest of my achievements in full auto and I have one left and that's rank 10 online I just got my million or was it a million like was it a million points in just the game and then 100 no 1000 kills I got the achievement for that and I have rank 9 I just did and then I just have rank 10 online to do and then I'm done with the game

111
00:07:21,084 --> 00:07:22,505
[SPEAKER_02]: What are achievement points to you?

112
00:07:22,545 --> 00:07:26,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you an achievement point whore where you have to have as many as you possibly can?

113
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:27,490
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes and no.

114
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,291
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of that way too.

115
00:07:29,912 --> 00:07:35,036
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I just want to get done with the game because I'm not really playing it too much anymore and it's just...

116
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:38,127
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay multiplayer, but it's not that fun.

117
00:07:38,427 --> 00:07:39,849
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to get done with it.

118
00:07:39,929 --> 00:07:46,518
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I feel like selling it, I know that I've milked all the achievement points out of it that I could possibly get.

119
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:49,482
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of yes and no on the achievement points.

120
00:07:49,683 --> 00:07:51,645
[SPEAKER_02]: If I see, for instance, take...

121
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:54,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Take Geometry Wars.

122
00:07:54,512 --> 00:08:02,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Geometry Wars has an achievement point that you get like 5 or 10 points, I don't remember, for what's called pacifism, where you don't get hit by anything for 60 seconds.

123
00:08:02,558 --> 00:08:02,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

124
00:08:02,978 --> 00:08:09,142
[SPEAKER_02]: I was kind of like, okay, normally I wouldn't play the game like that, but okay, if I get 10 points out of it, I'll try it out.

125
00:08:09,162 --> 00:08:10,303
[SPEAKER_02]: And it actually is kind of tough.

126
00:08:10,363 --> 00:08:11,584
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get it my first try.

127
00:08:12,004 --> 00:08:13,325
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually a bit of a challenge.

128
00:08:13,345 --> 00:08:15,567
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I'll go out of my way for little things like that.

129
00:08:16,007 --> 00:08:21,131
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know people that, like, there was an article on the internet, I don't remember if it was this week or last week, um,

130
00:08:21,691 --> 00:08:24,572
[SPEAKER_02]: It was about how to get easily 6,000 gamer points.

131
00:08:24,592 --> 00:08:25,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's all sports games.

132
00:08:26,313 --> 00:08:28,413
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm kind of like, okay, no, that's not cool.

133
00:08:31,334 --> 00:08:37,636
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's the way you're getting the gamers points, then that means nothing when you look at the score.

134
00:08:37,816 --> 00:08:43,798
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's unfortunate that the score doesn't really tell you right away how the points were gotten, but I still really like the system.

135
00:08:43,838 --> 00:08:45,458
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's really kind of innovative.

136
00:08:45,918 --> 00:08:47,319
[SPEAKER_02]: It's certainly different, but...

137
00:08:48,693 --> 00:08:51,077
[SPEAKER_00]: I did play a little bit of Geometry Wars.

138
00:08:51,117 --> 00:08:56,987
[SPEAKER_00]: I did get the Pacifist achievement, which was a pain in the ass.

139
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:00,052
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only been able to get about 100,000, and then I get

140
00:09:02,564 --> 00:09:04,105
[SPEAKER_02]: I really suck at Geometry Wars.

141
00:09:04,225 --> 00:09:06,685
[SPEAKER_00]: There's too much flashy shit on the screen.

142
00:09:06,966 --> 00:09:10,647
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been wondering if I should try it in retro mode, if that would make a difference.

143
00:09:11,247 --> 00:09:12,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Your score won't rank.

144
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:13,868
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a different mode.

145
00:09:14,748 --> 00:09:18,589
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a ranking mode for it, but it's not the same one that the achievements unlock on.

146
00:09:20,052 --> 00:09:21,954
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just too flashy.

147
00:09:21,974 --> 00:09:24,776
[SPEAKER_00]: There's too many particles in there and stuff.

148
00:09:25,297 --> 00:09:27,259
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually reading an FAQ on the game.

149
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:28,240
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking on forums.

150
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,003
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I might have actually been on the official Xbox forums looking for hints on how to play.

151
00:09:32,324 --> 00:09:35,947
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are saying like, oh, you should be able to breeze through the first 500k easily.

152
00:09:35,987 --> 00:09:39,591
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, okay, am I just old and my hand-eye coordination has gone way down or what?

153
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I really have a hard time breaking...

154
00:09:42,694 --> 00:10:09,681
[SPEAKER_02]: like 200k on a regular basis maybe I'm just like I read a tip that I thought was interesting in the tip suggested that like if you're having a hard time with it you focus on your ship and nothing but the ship like you don't allow anything else on the screen to distract you except your ship so that way you're dodging no matter what and that will help you get through like at least like if they say the first 500k or million or something like that but then after that you really do have to use your peripheral vision because I guess things just start bombarding you like crazy but

155
00:10:10,117 --> 00:10:12,878
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll at least help you if you're struggling in the beginning like I am.

156
00:10:13,638 --> 00:10:14,058
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you are.

157
00:10:14,538 --> 00:10:14,858
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

158
00:10:15,359 --> 00:10:16,859
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I was playing Feeding Frenzy.

159
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:28,462
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing I like about this and the fact the way the achievements are is it's a game where, say I beat 10 levels of it, I can start it back later and play starting from level 10 and keep going on.

160
00:10:28,722 --> 00:10:31,023
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes achievements really simple on it.

161
00:10:31,043 --> 00:10:33,624
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, it's a pretty simple game, actually.

162
00:10:34,844 --> 00:10:37,445
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one where you start off as a small fish and

163
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:51,911
[SPEAKER_02]: I've played a game exactly like that at Dave and Buster's except it gave you tickets and I have to say tickets are a little cooler than the achievement points because tickets I can trade in for stuffed animals which is cool.

164
00:10:52,816 --> 00:11:00,818
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just waiting for when they come up with something on Xbox Live that you can only access it if you have X amount of achievement points or something like that.

165
00:11:00,979 --> 00:11:02,499
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would be kind of neat.

166
00:11:02,619 --> 00:11:11,602
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't necessarily have to be a game, but something like a beta only open to hardcore players who got a certain amount of achievement points on something.

167
00:11:12,302 --> 00:11:14,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe one of these deals.

168
00:11:14,463 --> 00:11:15,263
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem is...

169
00:11:15,763 --> 00:11:22,226
[SPEAKER_02]: is that it's these articles like the How to Get 6,000 Gamers Points Easily that are going to kind of screw that up.

170
00:11:22,326 --> 00:11:25,467
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, some games, the achievement points are way easier to get than others.

171
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:29,689
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, going with Xbox Live Arcade, Crystal Quest compared to Bejeweled.

172
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:37,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Bejeweled, you have to play hardcore because all the achievements practically are like astronomical numbers of rounds and points.

173
00:11:38,182 --> 00:11:45,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas Crystal Quest, if you get pretty good at it, you'll only have to play through one or two times to really unlock the bulk of achievement points.

174
00:11:46,065 --> 00:11:48,106
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, some of the time, you know, you have to spend time with it for the others.

175
00:11:48,566 --> 00:11:53,628
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, put the two games side by side and, you know, it's much easier to get it in the one.

176
00:11:55,216 --> 00:11:55,496
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

177
00:11:55,996 --> 00:12:05,678
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, I've been playing a little bit of Burnout, a little bit of Full Auto, of course, The Outfit, as I mentioned, and I think that's pretty much it.

178
00:12:05,698 --> 00:12:14,460
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just been kind of bouncing around from those, and a little bit of Grand Theft Auto, Liberty City Stories, of course, and God, I think there was another game in there, too.

179
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,781
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I actually played The Simpsons on my main cabinet for a little bit.

180
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:19,781
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's about it.

181
00:12:20,521 --> 00:12:20,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, awesome.

182
00:12:21,921 --> 00:12:22,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, DarkSakura?

183
00:12:24,342 --> 00:12:24,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing.

184
00:12:25,069 --> 00:12:26,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I thought you had a thought, because you reached for your mic suddenly.

185
00:12:26,952 --> 00:12:28,956
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was going to fall.

186
00:12:29,176 --> 00:12:33,083
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what it might be, is that you're getting ready to scold me for my gaming week.

187
00:12:33,403 --> 00:12:34,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, what'd you do?

188
00:12:35,186 --> 00:12:38,612
[SPEAKER_02]: I spent the majority of my gaming week playing Final Fantasy XI.

189
00:12:40,578 --> 00:12:42,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Addict, that's okay, I went back to Ragnarok online.

190
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Addict, alright, so we're even.

191
00:12:45,783 --> 00:12:50,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I've been playing Fallout SE 11 starting over from scratch, and I think I mentioned on the last podcast I was going to do this.

192
00:12:50,967 --> 00:12:53,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've actually been in the habit of doing it this week and playing.

193
00:12:53,669 --> 00:13:01,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm already up to level 9, yes, and soon I'll be level 30 and be all ready for the expansion pack when it comes out, because the expansion pack

194
00:13:02,165 --> 00:13:03,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely looks like it's going to be worth a try.

195
00:13:03,886 --> 00:13:08,048
[SPEAKER_02]: They're incorporating elements of older Final Fantasies and stuff into it, which is kind of neat.

196
00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:12,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody pointed out to me in the trailer, you can see one of the judges from Final Fantasy Tactics and stuff in it.

197
00:13:13,512 --> 00:13:16,273
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's kind of neat.

198
00:13:16,473 --> 00:13:17,334
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see what happens with that.

199
00:13:17,354 --> 00:13:19,115
[SPEAKER_02]: I am interested in some of the new classes.

200
00:13:19,395 --> 00:13:22,817
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm prepping my little Taru, because I reincarnated myself as a Taru.

201
00:13:22,917 --> 00:13:24,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I said I'm doing an absolute clean start.

202
00:13:25,419 --> 00:13:28,060
[SPEAKER_02]: New server, so I can't get any of the same help I had before.

203
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,361
[SPEAKER_02]: New character, new everything.

204
00:13:29,641 --> 00:13:31,302
[SPEAKER_02]: So I reincarnated myself as a little Taru Taru.

205
00:13:31,662 --> 00:13:33,223
[SPEAKER_02]: So I plan on being a blue mage.

206
00:13:33,463 --> 00:13:36,384
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem is that everybody's going to be a blue mage when that thing rolls out.

207
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember Lil' Kim.

208
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:42,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Lil' Kim was my mule on my old server, and she was a Taru as well.

209
00:13:42,587 --> 00:13:45,468
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll tell you the name of my new character off-air.

210
00:13:45,548 --> 00:13:47,949
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will say I play on the Seraph server now.

211
00:13:48,109 --> 00:13:50,450
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm watching you guys, the Seraph server.

212
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,631
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll talk smack about you on the show if you wrong me.

213
00:13:53,352 --> 00:13:55,072
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you my character name off-air because it's really cool.

214
00:13:55,853 --> 00:13:56,393
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't want to get...

215
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:01,589
[SPEAKER_04]: You actually reminded me that I did forget to say that I'm on a free server for Ragnarok.

216
00:14:02,229 --> 00:14:04,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever happened with the legality of that?

217
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:04,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that kind of a gray area?

218
00:14:04,971 --> 00:14:06,412
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think Gravity cares anymore.

219
00:14:06,632 --> 00:14:06,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

220
00:14:07,452 --> 00:14:09,334
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as they're making money, huh?

221
00:14:09,774 --> 00:14:11,895
[SPEAKER_04]: The server that I'm playing on is super dedicated.

222
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:16,598
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's so much better than playing on IRO.

223
00:14:17,358 --> 00:14:18,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never had any problem.

224
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,480
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been really great.

225
00:14:21,421 --> 00:14:21,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

226
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:27,178
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as the rest of my gaming week, I also was playing quite a bit of Xbox Live Arcade.

227
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:28,499
[SPEAKER_02]: I checked out Jewel Quest.

228
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:34,483
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually bought Jewel Quest because I knew it was kind of like Bejeweled, and I like Bejeweled, so I bought it.

229
00:14:35,043 --> 00:14:38,645
[SPEAKER_02]: My problem with Jewel Quest is that it's too much like Bejeweled.

230
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:39,846
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

231
00:14:39,886 --> 00:14:40,627
[SPEAKER_02]: For some reason, I just...

232
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:42,328
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

233
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:09,526
[SPEAKER_02]: The achievement points are certainly easier, but honestly, I'm not really considering that in my review of the game.

234
00:15:10,106 --> 00:15:11,226
[SPEAKER_02]: I put the game side by side.

235
00:15:11,307 --> 00:15:13,107
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely prefer Bejeweled.

236
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:15,007
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's got some more modes.

237
00:15:15,027 --> 00:15:16,488
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just more polished looking.

238
00:15:16,568 --> 00:15:19,668
[SPEAKER_02]: When you consider that they're essentially the same game, I mean, not really.

239
00:15:20,048 --> 00:15:28,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Jewel Quest is about not how many three in a row you connect, but where you get them on the board, and it kind of influences your strategy a little bit, but really...

240
00:15:28,885 --> 00:15:29,145
[SPEAKER_02]: I want Tetris.

241
00:15:29,165 --> 00:15:31,666
[SPEAKER_02]: They have Tetris Grandmaster that came out for the Japanese launch.

242
00:15:54,403 --> 00:15:55,244
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think this is true.

243
00:16:16,696 --> 00:16:27,713
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe they own the exclusive rights for their own systems or something because you notice all the Tetris games that come out on Nintendo systems are Nintendo games like this new DS one that's coming out is a Nintendo game the old Game Boy one I don't know I don't know

244
00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:30,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe somebody in the chat room knows.

245
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:30,600
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

246
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,040
[SPEAKER_02]: That's OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

[SPEAKER_02]: Click on chat if you want to share some information with us.

248
00:16:35,021 --> 00:16:36,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, of course, you can always drop us an email as well.

249
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:38,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

250
00:16:39,463 --> 00:16:41,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into some gaming news for tonight.

251
00:16:41,544 --> 00:16:42,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start it off.

252
00:16:42,964 --> 00:16:45,545
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of us might have something to contribute here with the PlayStation 3.

253
00:16:46,086 --> 00:16:48,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, they had that huge press conference earlier this week.

254
00:16:48,887 --> 00:16:53,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably most of you guys on the internet have read it by now, but we have to talk about it anyway.

255
00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:54,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly, we want to give our input.

256
00:16:55,209 --> 00:16:56,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, start us off with a summary.

257
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,650
[SPEAKER_02]: What did we find out about after this conference this week?

258
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:02,171
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they announced a few things about both the PlayStation 3 and PSP.

259
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:04,552
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll start off with the PlayStation 3.

260
00:17:05,212 --> 00:17:06,792
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it's going to be launched in November.

261
00:17:07,252 --> 00:17:13,314
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that was only news to Sony because everyone else figured that it was going to be November.

262
00:17:13,614 --> 00:17:19,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's nice to hear them actually confirm it because I think most of us were thinking it was going to be 2007 at this point.

263
00:17:19,796 --> 00:17:24,257
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm not confirming it and saying that they're actually going to make it in November because, I mean...

264
00:17:25,306 --> 00:17:33,510
[SPEAKER_00]: After all, Microsoft did say they were going to ship 3 million units by the three-month mark, and that never happened.

265
00:17:34,651 --> 00:17:37,212
[SPEAKER_04]: I credit Sony with a little bit more brains than Microsoft.

266
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:38,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll see.

267
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:40,494
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about that.

268
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:48,538
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's interesting is that I was reading a separate article this week that talked about the launch of the Sega Saturn, and when they launched that, it was like a surprise announcement at E3.

269
00:17:48,578 --> 00:17:51,439
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of those things that was like, we're not telling you to wait until November.

270
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:52,620
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on shelves today.

271
00:17:53,396 --> 00:18:00,372
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's kind of cool, but at the same time it also kind of killed the system because with the surprise announcement there wasn't enough time for all the developers to get the games out, so...

272
00:18:00,973 --> 00:18:02,513
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's kind of a double-edged sword there.

273
00:18:02,553 --> 00:18:03,034
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no, no.

274
00:18:03,234 --> 00:18:07,915
[SPEAKER_04]: What killed the system, what killed the Saturn was Sega's whole marketing ploy.

275
00:18:08,735 --> 00:18:14,217
[SPEAKER_04]: The Saturn did very well in Japan, and it had much better games that we never saw, that never saw the light of day in the U.S.

276
00:18:14,237 --> 00:18:14,717
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

277
00:18:15,097 --> 00:18:16,297
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very import-friendly.

278
00:18:16,817 --> 00:18:17,498
[SPEAKER_02]: True, true.

279
00:18:17,778 --> 00:18:18,918
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what killed the Saturn.

280
00:18:19,018 --> 00:18:20,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, sorry, this isn't about Sega, it's about Sony.

281
00:18:20,939 --> 00:18:21,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, moving on.

282
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:27,840
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, it's going to be released somewhere in the first 10, 11 days of November.

283
00:18:28,101 --> 00:18:29,581
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so the early part of November there.

284
00:18:30,174 --> 00:18:35,637
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's going to be including a 60 gigabyte hard drive pre-installed with Linux.

285
00:18:37,338 --> 00:18:37,919
[SPEAKER_02]: So, ha!

286
00:18:38,219 --> 00:18:44,423
[SPEAKER_02]: They beat the... I think that's kind of funny is that they've kind of just given in to the fact that somebody's going to install Linux on this anyway, so here you go.

287
00:18:44,443 --> 00:18:45,163
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be us.

288
00:18:46,824 --> 00:18:48,485
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, so I thought that was funny.

289
00:18:49,005 --> 00:18:51,227
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have, what was it...

290
00:18:52,574 --> 00:18:54,175
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

291
00:19:19,671 --> 00:19:20,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, come on.

292
00:19:20,712 --> 00:19:22,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony's got to know better than that.

293
00:19:22,052 --> 00:19:23,133
[SPEAKER_00]: They know that would be suicide.

294
00:19:23,153 --> 00:19:24,373
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you have to understand this.

295
00:19:24,393 --> 00:19:30,116
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be $900 if you bought the system for what it's actually worth, but you know everyone sells systems at a loss.

296
00:19:30,376 --> 00:19:32,537
[SPEAKER_00]: Sony's going to have to be prepared to take a hell of a loss on these.

297
00:19:32,557 --> 00:19:33,437
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be interesting.

298
00:19:33,457 --> 00:19:34,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to lose money to make money.

299
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:41,201
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, the whole thing was with the Blu-ray drive, and that's what half the cost is.

300
00:19:41,441 --> 00:19:43,222
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well.

301
00:19:45,063 --> 00:19:50,565
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to be fully backwards compatible with all PlayStation and PlayStation 2 titles.

302
00:19:50,906 --> 00:19:55,387
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to basically upscale all of them like the 360 does with the games.

303
00:19:55,467 --> 00:19:57,728
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of the most exciting announcements to me, honestly.

304
00:19:59,109 --> 00:20:05,312
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, they're going to be digitally distributing PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 games to the console.

305
00:20:06,637 --> 00:20:07,377
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation Hub Service

306
00:20:33,223 --> 00:20:49,833
[SPEAKER_00]: which is going to be for both the PlayStation Portable and the PS3 as well as they're going to be what's kind of neat about that is it will be free to play multiplayer games but there's going to be additional content on there that will cost money and they'll have subscription services for that type of stuff.

307
00:20:51,073 --> 00:20:56,416
[SPEAKER_00]: The servers will not be a central server like Microsoft.

308
00:20:56,677 --> 00:21:00,659
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be separate, each run by different companies but

309
00:21:01,331 --> 00:21:03,713
[SPEAKER_00]: Spirit Snare says, I think they're probably aiming for 550-ish.

310
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:21,950
[SPEAKER_02]: 5.50 is a little more reasonable.

311
00:21:22,411 --> 00:21:28,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, if I were to make a prediction, to compete with Microsoft, they've got to do one of two things.

312
00:21:29,117 --> 00:21:32,701
[SPEAKER_02]: They really have to release this system for $399, just like the Xbox.

313
00:21:32,721 --> 00:21:33,462
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to be less than $400.

314
00:21:34,122 --> 00:21:36,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but they're flat out saying it's not going to be less than $400.

315
00:21:37,285 --> 00:21:44,048
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm thinking that they're going to have to release, I think the price point will be $4.99 is my guess, and of course I don't know shit, but $4.99 is my guess.

316
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:51,552
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're really going to emphasize Blu-ray, this will play movies in high def, and they're going to say you need this.

317
00:21:51,612 --> 00:21:55,093
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to really emphasize those things that that system can do that Xbox 360 doesn't do.

318
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:56,034
[SPEAKER_00]: What they need to do.

319
00:21:56,334 --> 00:22:12,417
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're going to see them throw in a bonus movie like you remember when PSP came out they gave Spider-Man 2 free I bet you anything there's going to be a tie-in where the first few PlayStation Soul will come with a free Blu-ray movie whatever Sony's big summer picture is will be the tie-in movie

320
00:22:12,537 --> 00:22:15,058
[SPEAKER_00]: What they need to do is they need to have this system.

321
00:22:15,098 --> 00:22:21,021
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to emphasize the fact that you don't have to go out and buy all these additional peripherals and crap that you had to do with the 360.

322
00:22:21,802 --> 00:22:22,622
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I got a system.

323
00:22:22,882 --> 00:22:24,203
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wait, now I got controllers.

324
00:22:24,383 --> 00:22:26,324
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, each one of those are $40 each.

325
00:22:26,484 --> 00:22:28,265
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I have to buy the right cables for my TV.

326
00:22:28,545 --> 00:22:30,386
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, those are also $40 each.

327
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:33,087
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I didn't get a remote with mine.

328
00:22:33,207 --> 00:22:33,627
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, guess what?

329
00:22:33,647 --> 00:22:34,828
[SPEAKER_00]: That's $40 also.

330
00:22:34,988 --> 00:22:36,769
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it all adds up in the end.

331
00:22:37,321 --> 00:22:39,763
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, those controllers, how much did it cost Microsoft to make them?

332
00:22:39,823 --> 00:22:41,325
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, it was like $10 or something.

333
00:22:41,685 --> 00:22:42,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting way to look at it.

334
00:22:43,426 --> 00:22:44,948
[SPEAKER_00]: They're making their money back in peripherals.

335
00:22:45,348 --> 00:22:46,169
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the money is.

336
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:47,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't Spider-Man 3 this summer?

337
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:49,652
[SPEAKER_00]: No, Spider-Man 3 is next summer.

338
00:22:49,972 --> 00:22:54,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Dirty Thief just made a good point to give Advent Children as the free movie.

339
00:22:55,777 --> 00:22:58,079
[SPEAKER_02]: But would they be able to do that when it's really Square's movie?

340
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:00,141
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, certainly a lot of fanboys would love to see that.

341
00:23:00,161 --> 00:23:01,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Square's in Sony's bed.

342
00:23:01,642 --> 00:23:02,263
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's true.

343
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:03,790
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know.

344
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:04,871
[SPEAKER_00]: Blu-ray version of it, though.

345
00:23:05,631 --> 00:23:06,051
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be hot.

346
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:06,931
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be.

347
00:23:07,571 --> 00:23:08,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

348
00:23:08,552 --> 00:23:09,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly make it more attractive.

349
00:23:10,412 --> 00:23:17,014
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the other things, of course, they were talking about was the PSP and some of the stuff that's not much of a surprise.

350
00:23:17,074 --> 00:23:20,535
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew that there was going to be an iToy peripheral coming, a webcam type thing.

351
00:23:21,395 --> 00:23:26,877
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be coming, I believe, it was September was the announced date for that.

352
00:23:27,338 --> 00:23:33,640
[SPEAKER_00]: and then, of course, GPS is coming on later in the year, probably in the third or fourth quarter.

353
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:41,642
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, of course, with the iToy type of peripheral on there, they're going to be adding video phone support in the fall.

354
00:23:42,402 --> 00:23:50,044
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the other things that was kind of interesting, they did announce that there was going to be a core pack that's going to be a reduced price PSP.

355
00:23:50,084 --> 00:23:52,545
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you're just getting the bare-bones stuff.

356
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:53,445
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not getting a case.

357
00:23:54,113 --> 00:24:00,156
[SPEAKER_00]: No headphones, which to be honest, the case and headphones kind of sucked anyways, so save $50.

358
00:24:01,097 --> 00:24:07,860
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to be releasing a ceramic white PSP core pack as well, which is going to be pretty cool.

359
00:24:08,821 --> 00:24:10,602
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's Japan only though for the white one.

360
00:24:11,582 --> 00:24:17,686
[SPEAKER_00]: What is interesting though is they're going to be offering an official PlayStation 1 emulator for the PSP.

361
00:24:18,706 --> 00:24:40,303
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'll be able to digitally download these straight off the internet to your PSP and I think this is where the 4GB NAND Flash PSP comes into play where you'll be able to store these on your memory stick and I don't understand how these aren't going to be pirated from memory sticks but I don't know they're going to find a way I'm sure interesting

362
00:24:41,491 --> 00:24:49,100
[SPEAKER_00]: and of course with the next update the web browser will get full Flash 6.0 support.

363
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,743
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will be able to view most web pages.

364
00:24:51,763 --> 00:24:53,385
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to put some on our PSP site.

365
00:24:53,886 --> 00:24:54,527
[SPEAKER_00]: True, true.

366
00:24:54,747 --> 00:24:59,573
[SPEAKER_00]: And also they're going to be able to record streaming audio.

367
00:25:00,905 --> 00:25:01,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's cool.

368
00:25:02,045 --> 00:25:16,808
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's interesting about the PSP to me is that they're really trying to think of things that the DS hasn't done yet to really sell the system more as not a game system but as a personal entertainment system.

369
00:25:16,868 --> 00:25:17,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's put it that way.

370
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:24,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Like with the whole iToy support, being able to do the short videos and these exchanges over the internet and stuff with the old games.

371
00:25:25,169 --> 00:25:30,070
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're really trying to think of the things, and the web support too, like things that the DS...

372
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Really hasn't done yet.

373
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:34,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas most of the DS's innovations have been about the games itself.

374
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:36,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, don't get me wrong, have been great.

375
00:25:36,433 --> 00:25:41,776
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think PSP, you really see it trying to solidify itself as the more entertainment system as opposed to the game system.

376
00:25:41,796 --> 00:25:46,618
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what's interesting with the GPS thing is it is going to be available.

377
00:25:46,838 --> 00:25:50,980
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first games it's going to use is a new Hot Shots game coming out, which I thought was interesting.

378
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:55,322
[SPEAKER_00]: But apparently there's current games in the library right now that support it.

379
00:25:55,982 --> 00:25:59,044
[SPEAKER_00]: But just hasn't been unlocked yet or whatever.

380
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,981
[SPEAKER_02]: GS191 has a good comment in chat room.

381
00:26:02,101 --> 00:26:04,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh great, fucking Flash ads on my PSP.

382
00:26:06,843 --> 00:26:08,504
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I'm going to tell you this much though.

383
00:26:08,724 --> 00:26:19,629
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've been waiting for is Flash for the website because you can do a live 365 player in Flash and that's good because you can listen to our show on the go.

384
00:26:20,229 --> 00:26:20,749
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be good.

385
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:27,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever happened to the days when video game systems played video games?

386
00:26:28,151 --> 00:26:33,576
[SPEAKER_02]: well the PSP does play games and they've certainly got a lot of good games coming out this first quarter this year but

387
00:26:35,069 --> 00:26:35,409
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

388
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:37,631
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're seeing this trend with all the next-gen systems.

389
00:26:37,691 --> 00:26:38,832
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sad.

390
00:26:39,692 --> 00:26:40,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Sadness.

391
00:26:40,593 --> 00:26:42,354
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want to be just the game system.

392
00:26:42,374 --> 00:26:44,476
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to be that centerpiece in your living room.

393
00:26:44,516 --> 00:26:46,617
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's what we've heard in a lot of press conferences, too.

394
00:26:47,037 --> 00:26:49,759
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to be the place where you can download movies.

395
00:26:50,099 --> 00:26:53,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at Xbox 360, just released this week on Xbox Live.

396
00:26:53,442 --> 00:26:55,343
[SPEAKER_02]: You can download a music video now for free.

397
00:26:55,683 --> 00:26:57,805
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of like, you know, they're really...

398
00:26:59,006 --> 00:27:01,648
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's all necessarily about the games anymore.

399
00:27:01,688 --> 00:27:04,330
[SPEAKER_04]: That is why I love my DS.

400
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:09,754
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing that PSP has ever been useful to me for is actually just watching movies on the airplane.

401
00:27:10,314 --> 00:27:11,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I've watched Hellboy.

402
00:27:11,615 --> 00:27:12,676
[SPEAKER_02]: But Luminous is cool.

403
00:27:13,176 --> 00:27:14,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Luminous is good.

404
00:27:14,657 --> 00:27:19,861
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't really played much else on the PSP that I really like other than that and Popolo Cross.

405
00:27:21,323 --> 00:27:26,947
[SPEAKER_04]: If I want to play a game, I'm going to play a system dedicated to the game.

406
00:27:27,941 --> 00:27:29,983
[SPEAKER_04]: by a company dedicated to gameplay.

407
00:27:30,963 --> 00:27:33,525
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care what it looks like, as long as it's fun.

408
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:38,168
[SPEAKER_04]: You know... It's sad.

409
00:27:38,348 --> 00:27:39,569
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very... It's sad.

410
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:42,772
[SPEAKER_02]: So you think people's focus aren't on the games themselves anymore?

411
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:43,792
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember the Odyssey 2.

412
00:27:44,953 --> 00:27:45,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

413
00:27:46,454 --> 00:27:48,416
[SPEAKER_04]: That crap came out when I was two years old.

414
00:27:48,476 --> 00:27:48,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

415
00:27:49,236 --> 00:27:53,259
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember watching the little blips on the screen and thinking that it was so much fun.

416
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:54,180
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

417
00:27:55,407 --> 00:28:00,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Just seeing the way that games are going now, the systems especially, just sort of is heartbreaking.

418
00:28:01,672 --> 00:28:02,332
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very sad.

419
00:28:02,992 --> 00:28:05,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Very sad that people can't be satisfied with good gameplay.

420
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:06,875
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see, we'll see.

421
00:28:07,516 --> 00:28:09,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, moving on.

422
00:28:09,337 --> 00:28:11,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else you want to share on the Sony there, Loki?

423
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,201
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just trying to think.

424
00:28:15,021 --> 00:28:22,346
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the interesting thoughts about it, they did mention, I think it was the PSP webcam or their iToy, I guess they're calling it.

425
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:24,268
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be

426
00:28:25,963 --> 00:28:28,104
[SPEAKER_00]: They were calling it like PSP 290 or something.

427
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:33,526
[SPEAKER_00]: And I figured, okay, well, firmware 2.9 then is going to support this or something like that.

428
00:28:34,006 --> 00:28:41,309
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just kind of the, I guess their item code or whatever for it kind of tied in with the firmware that will support it.

429
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,130
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a good thing.

430
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:47,951
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to see some cool peripherals and stuff come out.

431
00:28:49,052 --> 00:28:53,393
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping that that webcam or eye toy can be used as a digital camera.

432
00:28:53,533 --> 00:28:54,734
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it's good enough for that.

433
00:28:55,766 --> 00:29:00,009
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I don't understand is how the fuck are you going to use it as an eye toy?

434
00:29:00,289 --> 00:29:02,251
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously, are you going to be flailing around?

435
00:29:03,111 --> 00:29:04,212
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to work like that.

436
00:29:05,633 --> 00:29:05,913
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

437
00:29:05,933 --> 00:29:08,075
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's more like what you're saying there.

438
00:29:08,095 --> 00:29:11,357
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's going to be more for chatting and for picture taking.

439
00:29:12,578 --> 00:29:12,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

440
00:29:13,198 --> 00:29:17,141
[SPEAKER_02]: If the PSP is going to be a little entertainment in a box, why not be a digital camera as well?

441
00:29:17,261 --> 00:29:18,282
[SPEAKER_02]: People like digital cameras.

442
00:29:19,683 --> 00:29:22,645
[SPEAKER_00]: People like cell phones that play music and have iTunes on them.

443
00:29:23,442 --> 00:29:24,422
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking dumbasses.

444
00:29:25,362 --> 00:29:27,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's go on to some other news this week.

445
00:29:28,483 --> 00:29:32,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into some news about a very popular PlayStation game.

446
00:29:32,424 --> 00:29:34,164
[SPEAKER_02]: This one being on the PS2, right Loki?

447
00:29:34,524 --> 00:29:35,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XII.

448
00:29:36,845 --> 00:29:39,125
[SPEAKER_00]: God damn, we've been waiting for that for a long time.

449
00:29:39,645 --> 00:29:41,825
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, if you're in Japan, you're already playing it.

450
00:29:42,346 --> 00:29:42,986
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's awesome.

451
00:29:44,246 --> 00:29:48,327
[SPEAKER_00]: But, if you're looking for it in the US, you're going to have to wait until Thanksgiving.

452
00:29:48,347 --> 00:29:50,067
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's when it's coming out.

453
00:29:51,621 --> 00:29:54,144
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard fantastic reviews on this game.

454
00:29:54,164 --> 00:30:01,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, we mentioned Famitsu Magazine last week, but I'm very excited about Final Fantasy XII and I wish it wouldn't take him so damn long to release it here.

455
00:30:01,531 --> 00:30:03,293
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still laughing about the potion commercial.

456
00:30:03,914 --> 00:30:04,875
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen that yet.

457
00:30:05,035 --> 00:30:12,303
[SPEAKER_04]: I know somebody posted... Well, I have a friend who lives in Japan right now who said, I guess she thinks it's tasty.

458
00:30:14,248 --> 00:30:15,548
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to the game.

459
00:30:15,608 --> 00:30:16,809
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the battle system.

460
00:30:16,929 --> 00:30:25,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of people have acted really weird about it, but being the addict I am with Final Fantasy XI, I think it's a great combination of XI and the old school Final Fantasies.

461
00:30:25,271 --> 00:30:26,271
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to trying it out.

462
00:30:26,331 --> 00:30:29,012
[SPEAKER_04]: If it plays anything like XI, I'll guarantee I won't play it.

463
00:30:29,212 --> 00:30:30,392
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't play like XI.

464
00:30:30,692 --> 00:30:31,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God.

465
00:30:31,432 --> 00:30:33,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you don't have to spend an hour looking for a party.

466
00:30:34,553 --> 00:30:35,094
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already there.

467
00:30:35,134 --> 00:30:35,814
[SPEAKER_02]: It's part of the story.

468
00:30:35,855 --> 00:30:39,918
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest... No, I don't like the gameplay in XI, which is part of why I quit.

469
00:30:40,118 --> 00:30:49,946
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest, it reminds me of a cross between Final Fantasy X2 or X and... X. Final Fantasy X and X2 and...

470
00:30:52,822 --> 00:30:54,243
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like doing that.

471
00:30:54,684 --> 00:30:55,384
[SPEAKER_00]: And Parasite Eve.

472
00:30:55,685 --> 00:31:01,171
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Parasite Eve, it reminds me of the battle system, the way they did that, where you've got this sphere where you can attack.

473
00:31:01,591 --> 00:31:07,597
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it's just, you can run around and do shit, but it's still like kind of an active time battle system.

474
00:31:07,738 --> 00:31:08,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, kind of.

475
00:31:10,179 --> 00:31:10,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XII Business Week

476
00:31:25,948 --> 00:31:30,111
[SPEAKER_02]: The quote was, There are rumors that the revolution could be released as early as June.

477
00:31:30,572 --> 00:31:35,817
[SPEAKER_02]: If that happens, and Nintendo sells around 1 million units, Sony could have a harder time catching up.

478
00:31:36,417 --> 00:31:42,383
[SPEAKER_02]: And that quote comes from Akitiro Itoa from Japan's game tracking service, Media Create.

479
00:31:43,424 --> 00:31:48,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, of course, when you look at the reality of it, the chances of the console actually coming out in June...

480
00:31:48,749 --> 00:31:50,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not going to happen.

481
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:53,492
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why is because the development hardware is not out there right now.

482
00:31:53,552 --> 00:31:56,994
[SPEAKER_02]: So if that's not out, it's going to be very hard for the games to be out by June.

483
00:31:57,074 --> 00:32:00,757
[SPEAKER_02]: So probably November is a more realistic time frame.

484
00:32:01,197 --> 00:32:05,220
[SPEAKER_02]: And Nintendo has also been kind of quoted recently saying Thanksgiving week of 2006.

485
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:10,343
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't think there really is going to be any June surprise in store.

486
00:32:10,443 --> 00:32:14,566
[SPEAKER_02]: So nothing like that whole Sega thing we were talking about earlier where they surprise us at E3.

487
00:32:15,106 --> 00:32:15,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Not likely.

488
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:16,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry to say.

489
00:32:18,053 --> 00:32:20,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on, somebody that works for Nintendo, Miyamoto.

490
00:32:20,755 --> 00:32:25,580
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Miyamoto reacted to the PlayStation 3 announcement this week.

491
00:32:27,062 --> 00:32:29,044
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too surprising the way he reacted.

492
00:32:29,084 --> 00:32:39,675
[SPEAKER_00]: It was basically, you know, kind of put a quote out there that's saying, you know, people are kind of getting tired of the same old video games nowadays, and what

493
00:32:40,439 --> 00:33:09,994
[SPEAKER_00]: these you know like Microsoft and Sony are doing for video games as far as they're improving the graphics but they're not really changing the gameplay any and so he's not too worried just because they've never really seen the other companies as competition because they're kind of in their own boat basically as being innovative whereas you know these guys are just pushing graphics and stuff you're not really pushing better gameplay I'm not surprised to hear that coming from Miyamoto not at all it's just you know

494
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,541
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to agree.

495
00:33:13,562 --> 00:33:15,202
[SPEAKER_00]: Games aren't really that much better.

496
00:33:15,483 --> 00:33:17,103
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what Jamie was saying just a little bit ago.

497
00:33:17,123 --> 00:33:18,304
[SPEAKER_00]: They look prettier, but they're not different.

498
00:33:18,344 --> 00:33:26,228
[SPEAKER_00]: In a personal stance, just looking at sales of different games out there, when I'm selling to customers and stuff,

499
00:33:26,926 --> 00:33:27,146
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on.

500
00:33:47,939 --> 00:33:55,406
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to ask Jamie, having said that a little bit ago about the, you know, it's sad that the systems are kind of leaning towards being all-in-one.

501
00:33:55,706 --> 00:33:59,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Does this strike you as Nintendo being committed to the games?

502
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:01,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

503
00:34:02,613 --> 00:34:05,776
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's always what they've been about, you know?

504
00:34:06,236 --> 00:34:09,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would they ever change their stance for the sake of

505
00:34:10,143 --> 00:34:10,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

506
00:34:23,837 --> 00:34:26,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but a good idea didn't really work out, though, I don't think.

507
00:34:26,518 --> 00:34:27,058
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what?

508
00:34:27,078 --> 00:34:27,738
[SPEAKER_00]: At least they tried.

509
00:34:27,939 --> 00:34:31,840
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would rather see them try and fail at it than not see them try at all.

510
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,661
[SPEAKER_00]: They tried to be innovative.

511
00:34:33,921 --> 00:34:35,101
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, look at the Virtual Boy.

512
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:36,642
[SPEAKER_00]: Dumb idea, but you know what?

513
00:34:36,682 --> 00:34:37,882
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a step in the right direction.

514
00:34:37,982 --> 00:34:39,023
[SPEAKER_04]: The Great Migraine Machine.

515
00:34:39,183 --> 00:34:45,485
[SPEAKER_00]: Granted, they should have probably not gone monochrome red, and they probably should have made it less cumbersome, but you know...

516
00:34:46,603 --> 00:34:49,025
[SPEAKER_00]: It did have the best commercials.

517
00:35:12,614 --> 00:35:13,235
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

518
00:35:31,294 --> 00:35:34,476
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to be trying to make this money back.

519
00:35:34,696 --> 00:35:39,758
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be honest, it's another fucking goddamn Grand Theft Auto clone.

520
00:35:40,078 --> 00:35:42,700
[SPEAKER_00]: Except, oh, now it has Marlon Brando in it.

521
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay, that doesn't make it any better.

522
00:35:45,181 --> 00:35:48,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now, to be fair, that article was more saying they didn't spend $810 million on the game.

523
00:35:48,403 --> 00:35:48,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Marketing, yeah.

524
00:35:51,084 --> 00:35:56,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not just that, but the fact that they didn't release it at Christmas time cost them about $800 million of that.

525
00:35:56,586 --> 00:35:59,767
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm sitting here going, wow, that still costs like multi-millions of dollars to make.

526
00:35:59,787 --> 00:36:01,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I'm not surprised because you have all the voice acting in it.

527
00:36:01,908 --> 00:36:04,349
[SPEAKER_02]: You're basically making a movie on a console.

528
00:36:04,669 --> 00:36:07,170
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm like, I totally see what you're saying there.

529
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:11,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually, these movie-to-games that they spend a lot of that money on are crap.

530
00:36:12,011 --> 00:36:13,412
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't think of a whole lot of good ones.

531
00:36:13,452 --> 00:36:14,012
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there's some.

532
00:36:14,032 --> 00:36:14,952
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not coming to mind right now.

533
00:36:15,433 --> 00:36:19,094
[SPEAKER_02]: But you take a game like Tetris.

534
00:36:20,826 --> 00:36:21,406
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

535
00:36:43,553 --> 00:36:44,234
[SPEAKER_02]: You were right.

536
00:36:44,894 --> 00:36:45,494
[SPEAKER_02]: You were right.

537
00:36:45,675 --> 00:36:50,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't even Nintendo say earlier that is not the reason why they delayed Twilight Princess?

538
00:36:50,278 --> 00:36:50,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

539
00:36:50,778 --> 00:37:01,866
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's Miyamoto saying, and one of the most important features is that because Revolution can run GameCube software, when you play Twilight Princess on Revolution, you can take advantage of the Revolution controller.

540
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:05,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Which makes Nintendo our Liar of the Week.

541
00:37:06,549 --> 00:37:07,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations, Nintendo.

542
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,271
[SPEAKER_02]: You're our Liar of the Week.

543
00:37:09,311 --> 00:37:09,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.

544
00:37:11,032 --> 00:37:11,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're going to hell.

545
00:37:12,824 --> 00:37:13,264
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

546
00:37:34,913 --> 00:37:36,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Script Magazine Script Magazine

547
00:37:51,047 --> 00:37:56,789
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically just sort of a day in the life of the production process for Silent Hill.

548
00:37:57,409 --> 00:38:04,531
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, talking with the producer in France, going over some of the lame ideas he started to bring up.

549
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:08,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, well, no, we want to protect the integrity of the franchise.

550
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:11,014
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a really neat article.

551
00:38:11,174 --> 00:38:12,354
[SPEAKER_00]: So I take it no dog ending.

552
00:38:13,564 --> 00:38:14,666
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be hilarious.

553
00:38:14,746 --> 00:38:16,449
[SPEAKER_04]: I think after the credits.

554
00:38:17,851 --> 00:38:20,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you stay after the credits and then there's a dog ending.

555
00:38:20,115 --> 00:38:20,956
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be great.

556
00:38:21,197 --> 00:38:21,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Or a UFO.

557
00:38:24,782 --> 00:38:26,185
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope they did that for the fans.

558
00:38:26,405 --> 00:38:27,928
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be so happy.

559
00:38:28,671 --> 00:38:33,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they were fully bringing up how awesome it was to work with Akira Yamaoka.

560
00:38:33,872 --> 00:38:34,492
[SPEAKER_04]: That was pretty cool.

561
00:38:35,752 --> 00:38:36,973
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a very good article.

562
00:38:37,653 --> 00:38:43,734
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I'll tell you what, as soon as I can find the power supply for my scanner, I'll make it available for our listeners.

563
00:38:44,274 --> 00:38:46,575
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would suggest going out and buying the magazine.

564
00:38:46,815 --> 00:38:50,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, because illegal reproductions are wrong, kids.

565
00:38:51,816 --> 00:38:52,616
[SPEAKER_04]: I can transcribe it.

566
00:38:53,156 --> 00:38:53,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there you go.

567
00:38:54,449 --> 00:38:54,809
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

568
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:55,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.

569
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:56,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that Script Magazine?

570
00:38:57,331 --> 00:38:58,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Script Magazine.

571
00:38:58,092 --> 00:38:59,253
[SPEAKER_04]: The I is in parentheses.

572
00:38:59,573 --> 00:39:02,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you're probably not going to be able to walk into a grocery store and find it.

573
00:39:03,016 --> 00:39:04,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, you can walk into Barnes & Noble.

574
00:39:04,377 --> 00:39:04,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Barnes & Noble.

575
00:39:04,777 --> 00:39:07,359
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to go to a more comprehensive magazine store.

576
00:39:07,379 --> 00:39:08,800
[SPEAKER_04]: I was at Borders when I saw it.

577
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:15,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, Tower would be very likely to carry it since they carry all sorts of interesting... I don't think they have that everywhere.

578
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:16,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

579
00:39:33,726 --> 00:39:34,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on.

580
00:39:34,486 --> 00:39:35,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to another story.

581
00:39:35,807 --> 00:39:40,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, regarding the PlayStation 3, there was some back and forth this week.

582
00:39:40,489 --> 00:39:48,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Right after the conference, people were saying, oh, that hard drive's not going to really come with the system or that's going to make it the $900 system.

583
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:51,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, tell us once and for all, what's the deal with the hard drive?

584
00:39:51,833 --> 00:39:52,593
[SPEAKER_00]: It is standard.

585
00:39:52,653 --> 00:39:57,035
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, of course you're going to... You need the hard drive to play the games.

586
00:39:57,195 --> 00:39:59,956
[SPEAKER_00]: They've come out and said that it's not going to be like the Xbox 360 where...

587
00:40:01,624 --> 00:40:04,265
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, if you don't have a hard drive, memory card, that would just be fine.

588
00:40:04,345 --> 00:40:06,046
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you need the hard drive to play the games.

589
00:40:06,566 --> 00:40:13,289
[SPEAKER_00]: So, of course, it's going to be standard with the system, and it was confirmed by Yahoo Games.

590
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:17,019
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, Yahoo Games is actually legitimate.

591
00:40:17,059 --> 00:40:18,381
[SPEAKER_00]: That's surprising.

592
00:40:18,621 --> 00:40:21,223
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a bigger shocker than the... Don't knock on them.

593
00:40:21,884 --> 00:40:23,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Yahoo featured our podcast once.

594
00:40:24,026 --> 00:40:25,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't hurt our relations there.

595
00:40:25,647 --> 00:40:27,289
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm sorry.

596
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:31,273
[SPEAKER_02]: In that case, Yahoo's so smart.

597
00:40:33,114 --> 00:40:41,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, speaking of hard drives, you may remember last week I called a certain gaming company a bunch of bastards for this news article.

598
00:40:42,019 --> 00:40:43,400
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to say one thing real quick.

599
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:50,624
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a great idea that they are including the hard drive because now developers can develop with the hard drive in mind, unlike the 360.

600
00:40:52,111 --> 00:41:00,294
[SPEAKER_02]: And speaking of the 360, I kind of called Microsoft a bunch of bastards last week over this news article, and it turned out to be false.

601
00:41:01,234 --> 00:41:20,741
[SPEAKER_02]: The 100 gigabyte hard drive rumor that was going around a couple weeks ago, or actually last week, starting from the Best Buy employee or something, they actually got word officially from Microsoft, from the global marketing team, saying, we haven't announced any additional hard drives for the Xbox 360.

602
00:41:21,801 --> 00:41:24,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Beyond the 20 gigabyte version available today.

603
00:41:24,423 --> 00:41:30,347
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to offer an apology to Microsoft for calling you guys bastards.

604
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:33,709
[SPEAKER_02]: And Halo Rocks, please forgive me.

605
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,230
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still bastards.

606
00:41:37,851 --> 00:41:38,472
[SPEAKER_02]: But not for that.

607
00:41:39,052 --> 00:41:39,753
[SPEAKER_04]: For other things.

608
00:41:40,532 --> 00:41:42,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Many, many other things.

609
00:41:42,453 --> 00:41:45,255
[SPEAKER_02]: We could find a reason why all these gaming companies are bastards though this week.

610
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:46,476
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Nintendo lied.

611
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:50,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo lied to us.

612
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,561
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel steep pain in my soul.

613
00:41:53,601 --> 00:41:59,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, chat room's saying that we're being too hard on Nintendo because maybe that wasn't... Where did that come from?

614
00:41:59,345 --> 00:42:04,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo Maniac 64, of course, defending Nintendo saying, that doesn't mean that's why it was delayed.

615
00:42:05,269 --> 00:42:09,852
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that Zelda thing isn't necessarily the only reason why it was delayed.

616
00:42:10,772 --> 00:42:13,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, good incentive, right?

617
00:42:13,994 --> 00:42:17,716
[SPEAKER_02]: I think back to the Zelda games that were on Game Boy Color and the Game Boy Advance.

618
00:42:18,256 --> 00:42:24,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Why didn't they come out to the end of Game Boy Color for that exact same reason to transition people onto Game Boy Advance with one of their biggest franchises?

619
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:25,780
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not surprised at all.

620
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,521
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question for Nintendo.

621
00:42:27,941 --> 00:42:29,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Why didn't they give us the Satellaview?

622
00:42:31,457 --> 00:42:32,898
[SPEAKER_04]: I had the best version of Zelda ever

623
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:56,115
[SPEAKER_02]: or we would never do that to you guys.

624
00:42:56,195 --> 00:42:57,256
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we wouldn't.

625
00:42:57,296 --> 00:43:07,908
[SPEAKER_02]: The bad thing is that all these magazines put their April issues out in mid-March so now there's all these lies coming to you from these gaming magazines saying, oh, it's an April Fool's joke.

626
00:43:07,928 --> 00:43:08,429
[SPEAKER_00]: God, that sucks.

627
00:43:08,469 --> 00:43:09,450
[SPEAKER_00]: We're on the second.

628
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:11,833
[SPEAKER_00]: We're broadcasting on the second.

629
00:43:12,093 --> 00:43:14,436
[SPEAKER_00]: If only one more day we could have fun at that show.

630
00:43:14,836 --> 00:43:16,817
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, today we're doing it without a script!

631
00:43:16,837 --> 00:43:17,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Woohoo!

632
00:43:17,317 --> 00:43:26,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so now we would like to tell you about some of the real lies being spread this week by gaming magazines under the guise of April Fool's jokes.

633
00:43:26,401 --> 00:43:27,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what's the first one?

634
00:43:27,782 --> 00:43:34,485
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is, I'm not necessarily going to call this an April Fool's joke because I'm not really certain if it is.

635
00:43:35,445 --> 00:43:41,808
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it's some Duke Nukem Forever gameplay footage that was featured and leaked to the internet, I guess.

636
00:43:42,148 --> 00:43:43,049
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks like an in...

637
00:43:43,934 --> 00:43:46,576
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, what's another big lie under the guise of April Fool's?

638
00:44:13,544 --> 00:44:15,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Halo 3, The Ape...

639
00:44:32,652 --> 00:44:43,426
[SPEAKER_04]: who said he transcribed an article about the game from an upcoming issue of Game Informer Magazine, which is GameStop's big magazine.

640
00:44:44,808 --> 00:44:50,375
[SPEAKER_04]: It basically said that the game was going to have huge persistent worlds built around a modified Halo 2 engine.

641
00:44:51,156 --> 00:44:55,638
[SPEAKER_04]: That was going to feature Master Chief and would have a co-op mode for up to four players.

642
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:59,640
[SPEAKER_04]: But according to Bungie, it's a big pile of poo.

643
00:45:00,541 --> 00:45:06,543
[SPEAKER_04]: To quote, he said, We can't smack him for an April Fool's gag, not like we never did any.

644
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:07,684
Ha ha ha!

645
00:45:08,726 --> 00:45:10,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Halo Combat Evolved Xbox Live Marketplace

646
00:45:27,623 --> 00:45:30,305
[SPEAKER_02]: But not actually going to happen here.

647
00:45:31,146 --> 00:45:34,368
[SPEAKER_02]: At least they're saying here that this is not likely to happen.

648
00:45:34,409 --> 00:45:36,370
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably their April Fool's joke.

649
00:45:37,231 --> 00:45:46,698
[SPEAKER_02]: But you logically think, could Microsoft eventually jump on this bandwagon because you got Sony saying they're going to do the same thing with the PlayStation games?

650
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe this isn't such an unrealistic possibility.

651
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:51,122
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're going to need a bigger hard drive if that's the case.

652
00:45:52,943 --> 00:45:53,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

653
00:45:54,264 --> 00:45:54,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we shall see.

654
00:45:56,383 --> 00:45:57,564
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so moving on.

655
00:45:58,885 --> 00:46:01,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go from lies to apologies.

656
00:46:01,468 --> 00:46:03,890
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a show full of apologies and lies.

657
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:06,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, who's saying sorry now?

658
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:11,917
[SPEAKER_00]: Starforce, and I wouldn't really say that this is... I don't know.

659
00:46:11,937 --> 00:46:13,518
[SPEAKER_00]: There's sort of an apology here.

660
00:46:13,578 --> 00:46:16,721
[SPEAKER_00]: Starforce, if you guys remember back to last week, they were the ones that were reporting.

661
00:46:17,322 --> 00:46:22,266
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the company that does security, cop protection software, and this...

662
00:46:24,138 --> 00:46:37,328
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, they were leaking a torrent of Galactic Civilization 2 on their website just because Stardock didn't want to use Starforce's copper protection schemes.

663
00:46:37,448 --> 00:46:40,510
[SPEAKER_00]: So, they said, yeah, we're sorry.

664
00:46:42,051 --> 00:46:48,936
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just like, you know, basically, I don't know, it's just,

665
00:46:50,101 --> 00:46:53,143
[SPEAKER_02]: I was listening to some other podcasts this week that were talking about this company.

666
00:46:53,423 --> 00:46:54,343
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really evil.

667
00:46:54,923 --> 00:46:58,445
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I never really, because I don't play a lot of PC games.

668
00:46:58,805 --> 00:47:04,748
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, granted, between Final Fantasy XI and World of Warcraft, that's enough PC games for me because that's most of my PC game time.

669
00:47:05,068 --> 00:47:10,210
[SPEAKER_02]: But I never really realized they practically install spyware on your computer, it sounds like.

670
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:11,651
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of fascinating.

671
00:47:12,231 --> 00:47:13,292
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm surprised they get away with it.

672
00:47:13,312 --> 00:47:18,634
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so basically they apologized for the incident and said they took down the link.

673
00:47:20,405 --> 00:47:24,427
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just like, it's still pretty rotten to be doing that.

674
00:47:24,467 --> 00:47:25,367
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little too late.

675
00:47:26,568 --> 00:47:32,030
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, here's the thing guys, and I see a lot of people in our chat room right now are going, yeah, F them, they suck, da da da.

676
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:33,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it is guys, vote with your dollars.

677
00:47:34,471 --> 00:47:38,192
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't like this company, don't buy anything that their product is involved with.

678
00:47:38,952 --> 00:47:39,393
[SPEAKER_02]: End of story.

679
00:47:39,673 --> 00:47:43,494
[SPEAKER_02]: And then soon you will no longer see them because they'll go out of business because nobody's buying their stuff.

680
00:47:44,034 --> 00:47:45,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Vote with your dollars if you don't like it.

681
00:47:46,493 --> 00:47:46,893
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Sonic Team!

682
00:48:15,407 --> 00:48:18,548
[SPEAKER_02]: My God, do we know anything about why he's doing this or anything?

683
00:48:18,788 --> 00:48:27,549
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a speculation that he's going to be creating his own company that may be aligned with Sega, but that's, again, speculation.

684
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:33,471
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is the man that brought us Sonic the Hedgehog, Phantasy Star Online, Knights.

685
00:48:34,391 --> 00:48:38,952
[SPEAKER_02]: So pretty much like all the great Sega games you start to think about, this guy made them.

686
00:48:39,032 --> 00:48:40,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Yuji Naka is the man.

687
00:48:40,848 --> 00:48:42,709
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be like Miyamoto leaving Nintendo.

688
00:48:44,049 --> 00:48:46,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Miyamoto left Nintendo, Nintendo would crumble.

689
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:51,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Sega's already... I'm sorry, Sammy Sega.

690
00:48:52,673 --> 00:48:53,693
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to say Sammy Sega.

691
00:48:54,533 --> 00:48:56,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Then again, Sammy did bring us Guilty Gear or so.

692
00:48:57,134 --> 00:49:06,818
[SPEAKER_04]: But still, Sega... Having something like this even be rumored, it just sort of makes me think how the mighty have fallen.

693
00:49:07,559 --> 00:49:08,159
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I'll be...

694
00:49:09,289 --> 00:49:12,031
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to have a Sega in 20 years if they keep this up.

695
00:49:39,502 --> 00:49:39,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll see.

696
00:49:39,882 --> 00:49:40,583
[SPEAKER_02]: It hasn't happened yet.

697
00:49:40,883 --> 00:49:44,045
[SPEAKER_04]: I just mean for the greatness that Sega was.

698
00:49:45,486 --> 00:49:46,806
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

699
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, here's something else to mourn about.

700
00:49:50,088 --> 00:49:52,810
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, put this on your list of things to talk about when you're mourning.

701
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:54,871
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we have to mourn over as well?

702
00:49:55,372 --> 00:49:58,854
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, it was a good run or roll, I should say.

703
00:50:00,014 --> 00:50:06,598
[SPEAKER_00]: The Katamari team has broken up, and so we're not going to be seeing any more Katamari games.

704
00:50:06,858 --> 00:50:07,499
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know this?

705
00:50:08,234 --> 00:50:09,875
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the website says so.

706
00:50:10,995 --> 00:50:16,758
[SPEAKER_00]: KatamariDamasi.jp There was a three-day countdown.

707
00:50:16,858 --> 00:50:19,579
[SPEAKER_00]: And people were anticipating, oh, hey, there's a countdown.

708
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:23,021
[SPEAKER_00]: Last time it was the announcement of me and my Katamari.

709
00:50:23,241 --> 00:50:24,801
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's, no.

710
00:50:25,742 --> 00:50:26,322
[SPEAKER_00]: We're done.

711
00:50:27,643 --> 00:50:29,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's a really bad April Fool's joke?

712
00:50:30,884 --> 00:50:34,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the creator of Katamari Damasi himself has said he doesn't like video games.

713
00:50:36,309 --> 00:50:36,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Playground Equipment

714
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:07,322
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the problem with that being is that even if they decide to try to keep going with it, it's not going to have the same feeling that the games now do.

715
00:51:11,245 --> 00:51:17,910
[SPEAKER_04]: When you have a recipe and you have it at the same restaurant and then another restaurant tries to copy it, it just doesn't taste the same way.

716
00:51:18,751 --> 00:51:19,371
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same thing.

717
00:51:19,972 --> 00:51:20,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

718
00:51:22,153 --> 00:51:40,400
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and at the same time, you can kind of maybe respect this decision, honestly, because part of the problem with games today as it is, that Katamari Damacy kind of really went against the grain with this when it first came out, is that too damn many sequels, too many copies of other games, too many, you know, of the same thing.

719
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:51,424
[SPEAKER_02]: And Katamari Damacy was well respected for breaking that mold, so I think maybe this is why they've decided to quit now, before they become the thing that they were representative against.

720
00:51:52,166 --> 00:51:55,007
[SPEAKER_02]: So at that time, you kind of have to respect them.

721
00:51:55,647 --> 00:52:00,309
[SPEAKER_02]: I just hope that at least these guys will put out more games of some type.

722
00:52:00,369 --> 00:52:12,493
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if it's not another Katamari Damacy game, you've got to admit, that sense of humor that's in Katamari Damacy, that level that the music is at and all that stuff, that could lend itself great to another very original concept.

723
00:52:12,553 --> 00:52:13,133
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope...

724
00:52:13,809 --> 00:52:16,530
[SPEAKER_02]: We see many of the brains behind Team Katamari.

725
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:24,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if they broke up, many of the same big minds behind it create something new that can be the Katamari Damacy of next year.

726
00:52:24,674 --> 00:52:25,094
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see.

727
00:52:25,394 --> 00:52:30,236
[SPEAKER_00]: Or just, I don't know, just get part of the development team and start a new team.

728
00:52:30,596 --> 00:52:32,317
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take the same minds to create the game.

729
00:52:32,337 --> 00:52:35,418
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't really change much from both games anyways.

730
00:52:35,498 --> 00:52:38,279
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know.

731
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Comments from our chat room.

732
00:52:39,913 --> 00:52:44,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Arsef says, yeah, too many sequels would defeat the inventiveness of the series.

733
00:52:44,815 --> 00:52:48,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Xander C says, I hope he makes more games, but hopefully it'll be original stuff.

734
00:52:48,677 --> 00:52:50,058
[SPEAKER_02]: No more Katamari, please.

735
00:52:50,798 --> 00:52:51,738
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you have it.

736
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:54,940
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe fans are just kind of accepting this, that yep, you know what?

737
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:56,921
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what you gotta do to stay original.

738
00:52:58,468 --> 00:53:01,269
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, you know, at the same time, we can be original.

739
00:53:01,329 --> 00:53:03,110
[SPEAKER_02]: We can also celebrate the classics.

740
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:06,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you guys know the Walk of Game down at the Metreon in San Francisco.

741
00:53:06,552 --> 00:53:08,873
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, now, the Metreon was just sold recently.

742
00:53:08,933 --> 00:53:22,780
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know how this is going to affect the Walk of Game, but they just recently had their 2006 ceremony where they inducted John Carmack, who was technical director at ID Software, you know, Doom, Quake, that stuff, Sid Meier, Civilization, among many other things.

743
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:23,100
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that...

744
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:24,901
[SPEAKER_02]: That guy is honestly a god to me.

745
00:53:24,941 --> 00:53:27,362
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Sid Meier has made some of the greatest PC games of all time.

746
00:53:28,263 --> 00:53:29,844
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were lifetime achievement, guys.

747
00:53:30,504 --> 00:53:33,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, some games that were celebrated for their characters as well as being a game.

748
00:53:34,306 --> 00:53:41,951
[SPEAKER_02]: EverQuest, Final Fantasy, Lara Croft, and StarCraft all being inducted into the Walk of Game, which I have yet to really see.

749
00:53:42,071 --> 00:53:44,072
[SPEAKER_02]: So I might have to take a trip to the Metreon before it gets...

750
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:47,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Turn into the Mega Mall that Westfield might turn it into.

751
00:53:47,962 --> 00:53:55,467
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of am hoping that maybe Westfield won't screw it up, and they'll try to still keep it like a gaming center, like make it appeal to gamers.

752
00:53:55,507 --> 00:53:57,068
[SPEAKER_02]: That would make me a happy kid.

753
00:53:57,208 --> 00:53:59,749
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll put an EB in there as well, or GameStop.

754
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:04,072
[SPEAKER_02]: But they have the official Sony store, so that would be kind of competing, so I don't know if they could do that.

755
00:54:04,933 --> 00:54:05,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Sega Land Theme Park

756
00:54:27,441 --> 00:54:28,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not Sega come open a store?

757
00:54:28,762 --> 00:54:31,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the third-party developers kind of sell off some of their big things.

758
00:54:32,204 --> 00:54:33,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Namco could have a store, you know, all this.

759
00:54:34,085 --> 00:54:34,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Konami store.

760
00:54:34,766 --> 00:54:35,766
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be kind of cool.

761
00:54:36,547 --> 00:54:40,769
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet in five years it's going to turn into a Pokemon Center.

762
00:54:40,889 --> 00:54:43,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not open up a Pokemon Center in it somewhere, you know?

763
00:54:43,491 --> 00:54:45,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Pokemon Centers are evil!

764
00:54:45,552 --> 00:54:46,473
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?

765
00:54:46,493 --> 00:54:48,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people like it, so why not have it for them as well?

766
00:54:49,034 --> 00:54:50,015
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, something for everybody.

767
00:54:50,435 --> 00:54:52,437
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would be cool to keep it like a gaming-themed place.

768
00:54:52,457 --> 00:54:54,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people worship the devil, too, but that doesn't make it right.

769
00:54:58,354 --> 00:55:00,716
[SPEAKER_04]: People are entitled to their own religion.

770
00:55:01,216 --> 00:55:08,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of people worshipping the devil, a certain game franchise has turned 25 this week, and we're not sure how this franchise keeps going.

771
00:55:08,702 --> 00:55:11,924
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe it is Divine Darkness Intervention or something.

772
00:55:12,564 --> 00:55:13,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Frogger has turned 25.

773
00:55:15,086 --> 00:55:21,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get me wrong, Frogger is a wonderful game 25 years ago, but these recent releases... Let me put it this way.

774
00:55:21,191 --> 00:55:21,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so great.

775
00:55:21,691 --> 00:55:23,432
[SPEAKER_00]: The original Frogger was a really good game.

776
00:55:24,133 --> 00:55:27,115
[SPEAKER_00]: Every other Frogger game or game that has Frogger in the title...

777
00:55:29,124 --> 00:55:34,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I had a game on Commodore 64 called Frogger 2 3-Deep that was kind of neat.

778
00:55:35,428 --> 00:55:35,989
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.

779
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:39,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Then after that, I'll back up what you're saying.

780
00:55:40,371 --> 00:55:50,858
[SPEAKER_00]: Frogger... Yeah, pretty much Frogger nowadays is just... You see Frogger on a game or Frogger like Helmet Chaos, you're like, wow, crap.

781
00:55:52,039 --> 00:55:52,919
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what that is.

782
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:53,560
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crap.

783
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:54,340
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.

784
00:55:55,121 --> 00:55:55,301
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean...

785
00:55:57,077 --> 00:55:58,378
[SPEAKER_00]: Not much you can really do with Frogger.

786
00:55:58,418 --> 00:55:59,159
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a simple game.

787
00:55:59,179 --> 00:56:01,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they still have another game coming out.

788
00:56:02,541 --> 00:56:05,203
[SPEAKER_02]: I played the Frogger that they came out with on PlayStation.

789
00:56:05,223 --> 00:56:09,366
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that was about the last time I played a Frogger game because I just wasn't into it.

790
00:56:09,386 --> 00:56:10,366
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't that great.

791
00:56:10,466 --> 00:56:13,148
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, now they're trying to get a storyline.

792
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:13,809
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

793
00:56:14,669 --> 00:56:15,810
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.

794
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:17,872
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a goddamn game.

795
00:56:18,412 --> 00:56:23,255
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Frogger would be a good game on Xbox Live Arcade.

796
00:56:23,776 --> 00:56:23,956
[SPEAKER_00]: But,

797
00:56:24,525 --> 00:56:26,386
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it super ultra realistic.

798
00:56:26,646 --> 00:56:27,887
[SPEAKER_00]: Have it look like a real frog.

799
00:56:28,127 --> 00:56:29,407
[SPEAKER_00]: Have the traffic look real.

800
00:56:30,148 --> 00:56:30,988
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be cool.

801
00:56:31,268 --> 00:56:33,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Multiplayer might be kind of fun, like a race to the end.

802
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:34,890
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be the driver.

803
00:56:35,110 --> 00:56:35,910
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be able to push.

804
00:56:36,691 --> 00:56:37,211
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

805
00:56:37,291 --> 00:56:42,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about the innovation there with Pac-Man and on that Pac-Man versus, some people could be the ghosts.

806
00:56:43,034 --> 00:56:45,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not have some people be the drivers on Frogger?

807
00:56:47,696 --> 00:56:51,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Or have your frog with the ability to push other frogs in front of the car.

808
00:56:52,339 --> 00:56:53,781
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be excellent.

809
00:56:54,342 --> 00:56:54,542
[SPEAKER_04]: See?

810
00:56:54,562 --> 00:56:55,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone needs to play the crocodile.

811
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:56,164
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

812
00:56:57,085 --> 00:57:01,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Konami, you guys need to hire us to breathe some new life into your Frogger franchise.

813
00:57:02,512 --> 00:57:03,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

814
00:57:03,933 --> 00:57:04,234
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

815
00:57:04,274 --> 00:57:10,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe there's another way to breathe life into the Frogger franchise and some people are trying to imitate this in real life.

816
00:57:10,201 --> 00:57:10,762
[SPEAKER_02]: What's this about?

817
00:57:12,369 --> 00:57:19,204
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you get when you combine lots of alcohol, a Roomba, and something that looks like a frog?

818
00:57:20,025 --> 00:57:22,070
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you get real life Frogger.

819
00:57:23,755 --> 00:57:31,459
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, they have taken this Bluetooth-enabled Roomba, a green t-shirt, and lots of alcohol, and they made it cross traffic.

820
00:57:34,981 --> 00:57:42,484
[SPEAKER_00]: They made it cross a four-lane highway about ten times before it got run over by a Toyota 4Runner.

821
00:57:42,745 --> 00:57:47,907
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be honest, this is way more entertaining than any of those Frogger games that have come out recently.

822
00:57:49,168 --> 00:57:50,028
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do this.

823
00:57:50,108 --> 00:57:51,749
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be something I would totally do.

824
00:57:52,349 --> 00:57:53,370
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is excellent.

825
00:57:54,414 --> 00:57:54,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Pac-Man Ghosts

826
00:58:11,516 --> 00:58:16,319
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, in a future episode, we need to do another listless and games I would like to see imitated in real life.

827
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:17,840
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to think about that one.

828
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:19,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe next week if we have time.

829
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:19,360
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

830
00:58:19,821 --> 00:58:20,341
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have to.

831
00:58:20,501 --> 00:58:21,542
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a brilliant idea.

832
00:58:21,602 --> 00:58:23,763
[SPEAKER_02]: My hat's off to those kids who put that together.

833
00:58:23,783 --> 00:58:24,483
[SPEAKER_03]: They're ready for booze.

834
00:58:24,863 --> 00:58:25,384
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.

835
00:58:25,544 --> 00:58:26,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, wow.

836
00:58:26,705 --> 00:58:27,045
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

837
00:58:29,076 --> 00:58:31,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Techmo has a new automatic update for the Xbox 360 for Dead or Alive 4.

838
00:58:31,237 --> 00:58:32,077
[SPEAKER_02]: It's meant to...

839
00:58:50,387 --> 00:58:56,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Adjust some of the interface and balance the characters, tweaking the launcher moves, stun moves, sweeps.

840
00:58:56,709 --> 00:59:00,210
[SPEAKER_04]: A few of the character speeds are changed, some sped up, some slowed down.

841
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:07,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the power moves do less damage, encouraging players to be more skillful.

842
00:59:11,945 --> 00:59:16,006
[SPEAKER_04]: When you download the update, you will also have the option to reset your battle tactics.

843
00:59:17,266 --> 00:59:20,907
[SPEAKER_04]: But your Zac money, avatars, all that will still be the same.

844
00:59:21,507 --> 00:59:23,928
[SPEAKER_04]: The DOA4 update is available on Xbox Live.

845
00:59:24,328 --> 00:59:27,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if it will make the last boss less of a cheap bitch.

846
00:59:29,489 --> 00:59:30,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Because she is!

847
00:59:30,549 --> 00:59:30,829
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

848
00:59:31,769 --> 00:59:35,170
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly haven't really super duper played a whole lot of Dead or Alive 4.

849
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:41,051
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been too afraid to play online because I'll sit and watch some of those battles and I'll go like, you know what, I'm going to get my ass kicked.

850
00:59:42,553 --> 00:59:44,375
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to play with people on my own level.

851
00:59:44,435 --> 00:59:47,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are the handicapped players on Xbox Live?

852
00:59:47,898 --> 00:59:48,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Why aren't you ever on?

853
00:59:48,959 --> 00:59:52,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Those people who need a handicap on their game because they're not very good.

854
00:59:53,383 --> 00:59:53,923
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I need.

855
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:54,424
[SPEAKER_02]: I can admit it.

856
00:59:54,484 --> 00:59:55,685
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not great at every game.

857
00:59:56,846 --> 01:00:03,572
[SPEAKER_02]: I was talking to somebody recently online who assumed that because I did this show every week that I'm good at every video game, and that's so not the case.

858
01:00:03,892 --> 01:00:06,154
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some games I'm good at, I'll admit.

859
01:00:06,474 --> 01:00:09,657
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty good at a lot of puzzle games, but not every game.

860
01:00:09,997 --> 01:00:10,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, no.

861
01:00:10,497 --> 01:00:18,820
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you're going to add me to Xbox Live, if you dig through the Orange Lingerie forums and decide to add me to Xbox Live, be prepared that I'm not going to be much of a challenge in some of the games.

862
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:20,661
[SPEAKER_02]: In other games, it's on.

863
01:00:20,761 --> 01:00:23,502
[SPEAKER_02]: I will kick your butt on some of those arcade games, but we'll see.

864
01:00:25,203 --> 01:00:26,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob needs food badly.

865
01:00:27,683 --> 01:00:28,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Not gauntlet.

866
01:00:28,344 --> 01:00:28,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Gauntlet.

867
01:00:29,815 --> 01:00:31,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Gauntlet was more fun for me when I was a kid.

868
01:00:31,577 --> 01:00:32,899
[SPEAKER_02]: I find it to be too repetitive now.

869
01:00:33,179 --> 01:00:34,220
[SPEAKER_04]: We need Crystal Castles.

870
01:00:35,361 --> 01:00:40,147
[SPEAKER_02]: I think our webmaster, VXChaseNXV, I think he challenged me to Root Beer Tapper when that one comes out on live.

871
01:00:40,427 --> 01:00:41,489
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're on, bitch.

872
01:00:41,709 --> 01:00:42,189
[SPEAKER_02]: You're on.

873
01:00:42,450 --> 01:00:43,771
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to let us know how that one goes.

874
01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:44,292
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

875
01:00:45,133 --> 01:00:45,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess what?

876
01:00:46,054 --> 01:00:46,194
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

877
01:00:46,858 --> 01:00:55,883
[SPEAKER_04]: 2K Games has announced that Civ City Rome, it's a building strategy based on civilization, is currently in development for PC.

878
01:00:56,843 --> 01:00:58,664
[SPEAKER_04]: It's being produced by Firefly Studios.

879
01:00:58,724 --> 01:01:00,185
[SPEAKER_04]: They brought a stronghold.

880
01:01:00,985 --> 01:01:02,746
[SPEAKER_04]: And with Firaxis Games.

881
01:01:03,967 --> 01:01:10,870
[SPEAKER_04]: According to 2K Games, it's going to have the most detailed look at Roman life ever depicted on a computer screen.

882
01:01:11,911 --> 01:01:12,431
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a quote.

883
01:01:12,734 --> 01:01:15,177
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, until the sieves come out.

884
01:01:15,477 --> 01:01:21,204
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, then you'll have your nice Roman family that you've got to, you know... Yeah, I got nothing.

885
01:01:21,224 --> 01:01:27,791
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, visit to the, you know, annual orgy and... Are we going Greek or Roman here?

886
01:01:27,831 --> 01:01:28,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I know.

887
01:01:28,332 --> 01:01:28,932
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Roman.

888
01:01:29,173 --> 01:01:29,613
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know.

889
01:01:30,074 --> 01:01:30,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

890
01:01:30,754 --> 01:01:31,515
[SPEAKER_02]: It was also Greek.

891
01:01:32,176 --> 01:01:32,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, but...

892
01:01:33,928 --> 01:01:41,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, moving on from orgies, you'll start off with a small settlement build until you have an imperial city.

893
01:01:41,315 --> 01:01:51,486
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have amphitheaters, legionnaire forts, weapon workshops, circuses, gladiator school, a whole bunch of stuff, and then you can set it on fire.

894
01:01:51,746 --> 01:01:54,769
[SPEAKER_02]: So like most, really you get to burn your city in a day?

895
01:01:55,396 --> 01:01:55,756
[SPEAKER_04]: You could.

896
01:01:56,077 --> 01:01:56,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

897
01:01:57,298 --> 01:02:00,320
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is like most civilization games, you know.

898
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:03,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Start small, get big, take over world, repeat.

899
01:02:04,263 --> 01:02:13,871
[SPEAKER_04]: There are screenshots available, which I will be posting in our chat room, but these can be seen from, if you go to Eurogamer.net, the links are there.

900
01:02:13,991 --> 01:02:15,893
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, I've looked this through.

901
01:02:16,673 --> 01:02:17,714
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very pretty.

902
01:02:18,115 --> 01:02:19,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Very, very pretty.

903
01:02:21,657 --> 01:02:22,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of...

904
01:02:22,922 --> 01:02:23,963
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have ports.

905
01:02:24,363 --> 01:02:27,024
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the captures is of a port city.

906
01:02:27,624 --> 01:02:29,245
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got orchards.

907
01:02:30,286 --> 01:02:34,468
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a huge, massive city with a coliseum.

908
01:02:35,688 --> 01:02:36,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that does look pretty neat.

909
01:02:37,870 --> 01:02:38,930
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to link this in our chat room.

910
01:03:07,321 --> 01:03:08,382
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still kind of neat, I guess.

911
01:03:08,662 --> 01:03:16,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what my hope is for games like this is that we see an actual degree of historical accuracy in it.

912
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:18,591
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, because I think that

913
01:03:20,243 --> 01:03:27,208
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that a lot of the people who know me off the show know I have a very big interest in anthropology and ancient history.

914
01:03:27,868 --> 01:03:37,695
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think something like this not only would be good for the whole strategy building side of things, but also a chance to offer a little bit of a history lesson.

915
01:03:37,736 --> 01:03:43,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, civilization was pretty good with that because the world leaders that you would come across would be kind of like how they were.

916
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:44,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Siv-4 is getting an expansion!

917
01:04:10,413 --> 01:04:10,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, very cool.

918
01:04:11,174 --> 01:04:12,857
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I still haven't played Civ 4.

919
01:04:12,897 --> 01:04:14,300
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel really bad.

920
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:18,387
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those things where it's like I just don't have the time to play everything I want to play.

921
01:04:19,269 --> 01:04:20,471
[SPEAKER_02]: I really want to try this out sometime.

922
01:04:20,919 --> 01:04:27,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the expansion is called Civilization for Warlords with new units that are called Warlords.

923
01:04:27,965 --> 01:04:32,889
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll have some of the greatest military leaders and new scenarios.

924
01:04:33,049 --> 01:04:34,571
[SPEAKER_04]: You can change history.

925
01:04:35,472 --> 01:04:39,415
[SPEAKER_04]: You can take control of the ancient Chinese kingdom, fight in the Peloponnesian Wars.

926
01:04:40,356 --> 01:04:44,920
[SPEAKER_04]: You can join Alexander the Great, become ruler of the Vikings, pillage Europe.

927
01:04:46,021 --> 01:04:47,322
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of cool.

928
01:04:47,362 --> 01:04:48,263
[SPEAKER_04]: You can be Genghis Khan.

929
01:04:49,554 --> 01:04:50,394
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of cool.

930
01:04:50,414 --> 01:04:50,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

931
01:04:51,214 --> 01:05:06,438
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and honestly, maybe I should just wait until all the expansions for Civ 4 are out because then there'll be that gold box set because there's always a gold box set at the end of every Civilization's lifespan that's like 20 bucks that has everything in it.

932
01:05:06,758 --> 01:05:07,938
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe I'm okay waiting.

933
01:05:08,438 --> 01:05:08,799
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

934
01:05:09,759 --> 01:05:14,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Alexander the Great in this game looks kind of historically accurate.

935
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:16,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just leave it at that.

936
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:18,661
[SPEAKER_04]: For those of us who have studied a little bit of history.

937
01:05:19,443 --> 01:05:20,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anything else?

938
01:05:21,204 --> 01:05:24,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm also posting that clip in the chat room.

939
01:05:24,645 --> 01:05:27,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, by the way, our chat room is at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

[SPEAKER_02]: Click on chat, of course, unless you're listening to this on the podcast or via our AllGames.com syndication.

941
01:05:33,207 --> 01:05:38,829

942
01:05:39,329 --> 01:05:49,232

[SPEAKER_04]: Act of War, High Treason for the PC, Final Fight Streetwise

944
01:06:09,777 --> 01:06:11,839
[SPEAKER_04]: The Blockbuster Exclusive

945
01:06:39,913 --> 01:06:45,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Street Racing Syndicate, Elder Scrolls IV, Oblivion, The Godfather, Worms Open Warfare

946
01:06:50,905 --> 01:06:52,746
[SPEAKER_02]: and, of course, we'd like to take it back to the U.S.

947
01:06:52,826 --> 01:06:53,627
[SPEAKER_02]: with what's on the U.S.'

948
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:53,947
[SPEAKER_02]: 's plate.

949
01:06:53,987 --> 01:06:55,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what are we getting this week?

950
01:06:55,668 --> 01:07:01,771
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, of course, finally coming out for the 360.

951
01:07:01,811 --> 01:07:02,932
[SPEAKER_00]: That's this week?

952
01:07:03,252 --> 01:07:04,132
[SPEAKER_00]: That's this week.

953
01:07:04,553 --> 01:07:05,973
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely forgot that was this week.

954
01:07:06,194 --> 01:07:06,774
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my gosh.

955
01:07:07,154 --> 01:07:07,454
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

956
01:07:08,495 --> 01:07:12,257
[SPEAKER_00]: Mimai Katamari, of course, that's going to be awesome.

957
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:15,039
[SPEAKER_00]: Milgar Acid 2, really good.

958
01:07:16,653 --> 01:07:17,534
[SPEAKER_00]: What else was really good?

959
01:07:17,634 --> 01:07:19,175
[SPEAKER_00]: Tal's Curse of the Demon.

960
01:07:19,755 --> 01:07:20,355
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that one?

961
01:07:20,696 --> 01:07:22,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know.

962
01:07:22,657 --> 01:07:25,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Only if you're a hardcore role-playing game person.

963
01:07:25,219 --> 01:07:26,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, skippable.

964
01:07:26,339 --> 01:07:27,120
[SPEAKER_00]: The Godfather.

965
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:28,861
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really sweet.

966
01:07:29,622 --> 01:07:35,025
[SPEAKER_00]: Worms Open Warfare on NDS and PSP, which is going to be really sweet.

967
01:07:36,206 --> 01:07:42,370
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, Blazing Angels on Xbox and Xbox 360, which is also really cool.

968
01:07:42,830 --> 01:07:45,432
[SPEAKER_00]: And Capcom Classics Collection Remixed on the PSP.

969
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:49,210
[SPEAKER_00]: which includes Captain Commando and Street Fighter and Strider.

970
01:08:07,339 --> 01:08:09,260
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a Tetris TS commercial on TV this week.

971
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:12,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the gaming sites picked it up, but I actually saw it for the first time.

972
01:08:12,301 --> 01:08:14,022
[SPEAKER_02]: I was watching some show and they aired it.

973
01:08:14,282 --> 01:08:14,802
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of funny.

974
01:08:14,942 --> 01:08:15,702
[SPEAKER_02]: How did I forget?

975
01:08:16,363 --> 01:08:18,163
[SPEAKER_00]: Karaoke Revolution Country is coming out this week.

976
01:08:18,323 --> 01:08:19,264
[SPEAKER_02]: No way.

977
01:08:21,922 --> 01:08:23,342
[SPEAKER_02]: and of course next week, Beatmania.

978
01:08:45,516 --> 01:08:49,598
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll probably just pick up the first three and wait a little bit to hear the reviews of Elder Scrolls a little more.

979
01:08:49,618 --> 01:08:50,098
[SPEAKER_00]: How about this?

980
01:08:50,198 --> 01:08:53,079
[SPEAKER_00]: How about you just see my copy of Oblivion when I buy it this week?

981
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:53,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

982
01:08:53,539 --> 01:08:56,480
[SPEAKER_02]: And then maybe you could borrow my copy of Me and My Katamari or something.

983
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:58,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Which reminds me, I want the PSP back.

984
01:08:59,981 --> 01:09:01,242
[SPEAKER_04]: You will get your PSP back.

985
01:09:01,302 --> 01:09:02,682
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a funny story about your adapter.

986
01:09:03,163 --> 01:09:03,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh?

987
01:09:04,763 --> 01:09:08,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I loaned a Guanagirl my camera, and I gave her your adapter with it.

988
01:09:08,985 --> 01:09:11,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it looked like the one for my camera.

989
01:09:13,564 --> 01:09:14,145
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll get it back.

990
01:09:14,185 --> 01:09:16,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Guana Girl, if you're listening, I want that back.

991
01:09:17,252 --> 01:09:18,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I'm sending out the hitman.

992
01:09:18,334 --> 01:09:19,437
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my camera back.

993
01:09:19,457 --> 01:09:19,858
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm teasing.

994
01:09:19,878 --> 01:09:20,339
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all good.

995
01:09:20,780 --> 01:09:21,201
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

996
01:09:21,702 --> 01:09:23,044
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't have your adapter.

997
01:09:23,476 --> 01:09:23,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

998
01:09:24,296 --> 01:09:30,460
[SPEAKER_04]: I also, real quick, since we were just on the UK news, we actually have one of our UK listeners tuned in tonight, Simmel.

999
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:36,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that's hardcore, to be listening live when you're living in a different time zone, because I know we've had in the past... It's 3 a.m.

1000
01:09:36,544 --> 01:09:36,804
[SPEAKER_04]: there.

1001
01:09:37,184 --> 01:09:37,925
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, wow.

1002
01:09:38,045 --> 01:09:45,729
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've had folks from Australia listen live, too, and I know that's more like afternoon time, but that's awesome that you guys are tuning in, listening live in those different time zones.

1003
01:09:45,749 --> 01:09:46,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray for our fellow night owls.

1004
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:47,630
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

1005
01:09:48,331 --> 01:09:51,533
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I just wouldn't want to have to calculate the time zones, that's all.

1006
01:09:54,195 --> 01:09:56,717
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much brain work-y stuff.

1007
01:09:57,037 --> 01:09:59,259
[SPEAKER_04]: I moderate on the UK site.

1008
01:09:59,499 --> 01:10:04,623
[SPEAKER_02]: I think our streaming site, Live365, will auto-calculate on the scheduler.

1009
01:10:04,923 --> 01:10:09,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if you go to look at our scheduler of live programs, it'll auto-calculate the times for you, I think?

1010
01:10:10,037 --> 01:10:11,777
[SPEAKER_02]: So check that out on our station page.

1011
01:10:11,817 --> 01:10:12,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1012
01:10:12,538 --> 01:10:14,018
[SPEAKER_04]: For UK, add five hours.

1013
01:10:14,538 --> 01:10:17,278
[SPEAKER_04]: For France, add one or two more hours.

1014
01:10:17,659 --> 01:10:22,019
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, as I was going to mention, I was going to mention real quickly next week, which is really cool.

1017
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:28,661
[SPEAKER_02]: What is up with the end of March?

1018
01:10:28,741 --> 01:10:31,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the end of March usually this big of a gaming time?

1019
01:10:31,461 --> 01:10:32,402
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember this last year.

1020
01:10:32,462 --> 01:10:34,022
[SPEAKER_00]: It drops off next month, so let me put it that way.

1021
01:10:34,582 --> 01:10:36,662

1026
01:11:02,274 --> 01:11:06,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and I'm going to buy that a SpongeBob SquarePants Yellow Adventure game for you, because you should love that.

1027
01:11:07,216 --> 01:11:08,617

[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

01:11:11,858 --> 01:11:12,199
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1030
01:11:12,219 --> 01:11:14,300
[SPEAKER_04]: For those who don't know, Shermie is my cat.

1031
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:14,780
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

1032
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:15,280

[SPEAKER_03]: I remember.

1038
01:12:10,726 --> 01:12:21,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Capcom, to make fun of them, came up with Dan Hibiki in Street Fighter who wears a gi like Ryo and has Robert Garcia's hair.

1039
01:12:21,888 --> 01:12:23,208
[SPEAKER_02]: I never made that connection.

1040
01:12:23,508 --> 01:12:24,128
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.

1041
01:12:24,848 --> 01:12:28,009
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I used to play as Rob in Art of Fighting because he's got a good name.

[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1043
