13492	17578	Tonight, March 5th, 2006, a unique look at Destination PlayStation.
17878	21944	Japan votes on its top 100 games of all time, and we give our opinion on the results.
22344	27030	And Bobby Blackwolf from AllGames.com joins us to talk about what's new on their website this week.
32876	34978	It feels so good to be back.
35318	36399	You don't even know.
36499	43626	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio episode number 175 for this March the 5th of 2006.
43966	46849	Our first show back after a little bit of a vacation there.
47790	50532	DarkSakura and I had plans that took us out of town.
50933	55377	Real life gets in the way of independent podcasting sometimes so we took a little time off.
55857	65146	Loki, lovely job filling in there the past couple weeks with little, just short shows, just, it's a little bit of crack, just to hold you over, though, so we appreciate that.
65907	66267	Of course.
66367	68750	And just so you guys know, that wasn't the original plan.
69090	77138	The original plan is that DarkSakura, myself, and Loki were all gonna do one show, but DarkSakura was having, like, mic issues or something at her house.
77158	79140	And I was broke, and couldn't buy anyone.
80834	82354	I made do with my headset mic on pump.
98379	99740	I was just waiting for some witty retort.
100040	103423	I bought an iBook and the plan was to do a podcast for my brand new iBook.
103463	104203	I was going to do that.
104764	106485	That didn't work out too well, did it?
106825	107286	No, no, no.
107346	108346	It's not the iBook's fault.
108426	110688	I love my iBook.
110888	111609	I really do.
111769	112690	I'm sorry, Loki.
113110	113950	The whole Mac thing.
114311	115732	I'm totally on Jamie's side now.
115912	117233	I love the iBook.
117293	117733	It's great.
117793	118454	I mean, I'm...
119054	122297	When it comes to computers, I still consider myself bi.
123097	123998	I love PC.
124619	127401	Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't.
128262	130703	Some days I want a PC, some days I want a Mac.
130743	133205	But I really have appreciated what both have to offer there.
134767	135467	So I got an iBook.
135507	137769	And I wasn't able to do the podcasting on it.
137829	142493	And that was mostly because you go out when you go travel for a long time.
142513	146316	You go out with a certain plan and you don't always necessarily...
147256	149237	Get everything done that you originally intended to do.
149317	150297	Like, I just got too busy.
150477	152739	In other words, I just got too busy to take the time to set it all up.
152759	154819	Didn't you try using, like, the mic that's actually part of it?
154839	157221	There's actually a mic that's built in, but it wasn't good enough.
157361	157781	Exactly.
157801	159281	It sounded like I was talking out of a Dixie cup.
159442	166605	I mean, it would work for Skype or something, but it would not work for trying to do a professional sounding show as we try to fake once in a while.
167409	168970	Oh, by the way, hello.
169670	171490	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
171931	176912	I'm Rob Roberts, also known as Sky, your coughing host here, who just had some water go down the wrong pipe.
176932	177472	You know how that goes.
177813	181594	Joining me, as always, say hello to the lovely DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
181874	185095	I am caffeine-free for the third day in a row.
185255	186316	Congratulations.
186636	187276	Shoot me!
188337	194864	Speaking of getting off the crack or whatever... I'm freaking going through withdrawal like such a crack addict.
194924	196406	Are you getting bad headaches?
196566	201832	Because when I did the caffeine thing, and believe me, I went back, I got really bad headaches.
201852	207478	Okay, Thursday, my friend Julie brought chocolate-covered espresso beans to work and I ate 15.
209850	212393	And then we went to do gaming that night.
212813	216617	Tabletop gaming, you know, where you roll dice and not, you know, use your controller.
216778	217498	Yeah.
218459	220321	And nobody else showed up and I ate... You roll a D20.
220482	222444	I ate... No, actually we used D6s.
222484	223205	Oh, sorry.
223845	224806	No, no, we used D10s.
224866	225267	It's Buffy.
225667	226288	Alright, nerd.
227689	230452	Anyway, I ate like 10 more.
232521	233582	And then I was like, okay.
233982	234963	And I was bouncing.
234983	236525	Yeah, how's that no caffeine thing going?
236845	239247	And so Friday I was like, you know what?
239467	240128	No caffeine.
240168	241729	I've been drinking kombucha tea.
243471	244211	Sounds dirty.
244912	249055	It's made out of, it's a fermented tea made with mushrooms and sweet tea.
250497	252078	And it tastes like apple cider vinegar.
253039	253279	All right.
253795	257757	But it's been keeping me healthy and keeping the withdrawal symptoms down.
258538	261179	And I had decaf coffee.
261379	266022	So for all those people who have emailed concerned about your health, these are the actions you're taking to combat that.
266522	267803	I am so proud of myself.
267823	269383	I had a sinus infection last week.
270164	272005	And I did not... Okay, shut up.
272205	273366	Sorry, I'm not laughing at you.
273406	273706	I'm just...
274306	278230	Okay, I'm laughing for a real rude reason, but I mean, it's just, it's crazy.
278671	279872	I did not go to the doctor.
279892	281974	I did not let them put me on any drugs.
282034	283175	I drank hot tea all week.
284036	286639	And as a result, I am feeling fabulous tonight.
286759	286939	Good.
287540	295448	Because I am fully from here on, unless I break something, not going to the doctor ever again for an illness, unless I have cancer or a brain tumor.
295829	297130	Let's hope that doesn't happen.
298239	299339	We do have video games to talk about.
299960	307505	In case you haven't listened to Orange Lounge Radio before, we don't usually bitch so much about a personalized, but we've been gone for two weeks, so we have a lot to catch up on.
307885	309126	We'll get to games very shortly.
309807	311128	Say hello, of course, to Loki.
311208	312609	No Orange Lounge would be complete without Loki.
312809	314050	I do feel sick today.
314250	314490	Do you?
315891	318172	Here's the reason why I feel sick.
318632	325494	Basically, I went to the movies today and I saw Ultraviolet, but then I ate a whole bag of popcorn.
326014	331036	And then afterwards I went to Applebee's and I had fish and chips with their honey pepper sauce.
331296	334897	And then I was slamming down Pepsis all day long and playing Xbox Live.
335419	345028	And to the point where I was playing Xbox Live and either with the adrenaline of playing Full Auto and Pepsi's, you know, the caffeine, I was literally shaking like I had the chills.
345709	348491	And now my stomach feels like I'm, you know, I'm sick.
348892	352235	But it's probably just because of all that popcorn and I haven't eaten anything since lunch.
352555	353156	So, uh...
353756	355657	But other than that, though, I've been playing a lot of Xbox Live.
355757	358519	I swear to God, sometimes you and Jamie are like yin and yang.
358679	365683	I mean, she'll have this healthy story to talk about, and you'll be like, I went to Applebee's and dined on chicken strips, or whatever it was you had.
365943	367684	It's just because I ate a bag of popcorn.
368984	372086	and, you know, a bunch of honey pepper sauce and that stuff.
372326	372927	It doesn't agree with me.
372947	378930	See, for every hoop chakra chupacabra tea or whatever, Jamie has... Chupacabra tea!
379190	380411	Whatever it is you have.
382092	387115	Loki has, you know... And of course my neck is all stiff and has been hurting for like two days, but...
388362	390004	Other than that, you know, it's all good.
391025	393387	Lots of games and fun stuff.
393747	398231	And I did podcasts earlier in the week, and we restarted our Grand Theft Auto stats.
398512	401655	So, lots and lots of fun stuff.
402315	407780	But yeah, Ultraviolet, for those who are wondering if the movie's good or not, it's okay, but it has really bad CG in it.
408201	411244	And halfway through the movie, you're like, what the hell are they trying to do?
412044	412485	That's about it.
413547	413867	So, yeah.
414488	414828	All right.
415128	416809	Well, we also have a special guest tonight.
416889	420652	Once in a while, we like to invite other people in the house, and we've been ignoring him for the past 10 minutes.
420732	422553	Very sorry to Spike.
422793	423554	Say hello to Spike.
424054	426576	I don't mind being ignored, but thank you for having me tonight.
426796	427576	Not a problem.
427636	428417	It's good to have you here.
428557	432560	Don't be afraid to just put that mic right there, right next to your mouth, because otherwise, they're cheap mics.
432620	433500	They're RadioShack mics.
433540	434561	They don't pick up otherwise, so...
435523	436224	Cheap is the best.
436244	436704	There you go.
437224	438285	So, how are you doing?
438926	439806	Doing fantastic.
439826	441888	I've been playing Trauma Center all week.
442148	442428	Really?
442488	445610	And it's addicted me the way that I thought only World of Warcraft could.
445911	450354	And, well, usually we kick off the show with How was your gaming week?
450454	453016	So, Spike, since you're kicking us off, let's do it.
453496	455798	Trauma Center, is it really as hard as everybody says it is?
456218	456999	I haven't really played it.
457099	457479	I have to be honest.
457499	458140	I haven't really played it.
458200	459621	But I've heard it's insanely hard.
459921	462343	I tried playing it on the subway and almost killed myself.
462883	468167	But when I sat down to it, it sucked me in like a crazy, massively multiplayer online game.
468927	470829	Very addictive, very innovative.
471149	473471	I certainly would like to see another version of it.
474852	479675	I just want to point out, for those asking in the chat room, this is not the same Spike on DDR Freak.
479775	480616	Some folks are wondering.
480976	483718	This is my buddy Spike.
484318	486540	Do you really have any credentials to be on this program?
487392	488473	I guess not, but that's okay.
488493	488993	You're a gamer.
489094	490275	That's all you need, right, Spike?
491976	492677	He's laughing.
493497	493918	I hate you.
494098	494558	No, that's all right.
494979	495439	Everybody does.
495839	496120	All right.
496180	497801	Well, we love having you here.
498181	499142	It's different, different, Spike.
499162	501865	You know, it's exciting news, actually, about Trauma Center.
501885	504387	That's one of the games that's being brought over to the revolution.
504627	505107	Confirmed.
505268	506509	How do you know this, Mr. Man?
506589	507830	Because there's a news story about it.
508070	508350	Okay.
508771	509952	I'm assuming we'll get into that later.
510332	510832	Possibly.
511093	513535	Anything else besides Trauma Center in your week, Spike?
514756	516117	Not DDR Freak Spike, but Spike?
517060	518361	R. Spike, OLR Spike.
521682	522922	A lot of World of Warcraft.
523182	523462	Alright.
524223	525003	It's pretty pathetic.
525663	527304	What kind of character are you in World of Warcraft?
528964	530245	What kind of character are you in World of Warcraft?
530505	538708	I just started a Tauren hunter and it's quite exciting because it's my first horde character and
539437	541478	It's quite difficult compared to an Alliance character.
542139	542599	You know what?
542699	548462	I thought I would hate the Horde when I first started playing Horde, but I actually kind of enjoy Horde side, I think, a little more than Alliance side.
548863	552885	Alliance side is a little, I don't know, it's too much like every other MMO I've played.
552905	554626	I immediately made an Undead.
555107	558489	I made my elf, and then I made an Undead.
559089	560990	Because I had to have the zombie thing going on.
561931	562371	Like Thriller?
562391	562551	Thriller.
563206	564107	No, no, no, no.
564467	566048	Like Romero Zombie.
566068	566488	All right.
566708	568049	Anyway, thank you very much, Spike.
568069	572552	Well, feel free to give your input on anything throughout the show and all that fun stuff.
572972	577475	And if you have anything to plug, any upcoming projects, anything you're doing, just feel free.
577555	578096	Get it out there.
578796	580157	I hear you're a very good DJ.
580237	581238	You do DJ stuff, right?
581518	581918	Yes, I do.
582078	586141	Not like podcasting type of DJ stuff, but like spinning, mixing?
586261	587602	I go to clubs.
588382	591965	Right now, the iPod thing is a big deal, but I still say vinyl is the way to go.
592145	592465	There you go.
593782	594523	You're just a purist.
594643	595223	Nothing wrong with that.
595863	598545	Alright, let's go over to DarkSakura.
598605	599565	How was your gaming week?
600826	605288	Well, my series of gaming weeks, I did play a lot of Animal Crossing and some Pupalo Cross.
606229	609931	Although, I had to start over because I was on... No, actually I didn't.
609971	617094	I was going to start over on your PSP and then I realized that it was going to be on your memory card and I'm too lazy to move it.
617414	618415	So I just watched Hellboy.
619563	621525	and Kill Bill on the plane going to Alabama.
621545	622406	That's right.
622566	624147	Somebody borrowed my PSP while I was gone.
624187	624687	But that's okay.
624707	625548	She had my permission.
625628	626209	It got love.
626449	626809	That's good.
626829	628230	Because it wasn't getting any at this house.
628250	630672	I put it in a case and I cleaned the screen.
630692	632294	Because, look, let me put it this way.
632334	635316	The last time I played that was when Luminous was still a new game.
635496	635737	Okay?
635817	636778	Let's just put it that way.
636818	637418	That PSP.
637478	637718	Oh, no.
638179	640200	And I checked out OLR PSP on it.
640280	640641	That's it.
641181	643243	Otherwise, that PSP is not really doing it for me.
643423	643744	Sorry.
643884	644805	Sorry, PSP fans.
644905	648028	I'm just not feeling the love with the offerings that are out yet.
648348	650891	But Power Stone is coming to the PSP.
650911	651431	That is true.
651471	652572	That is so awesome.
652612	653333	I love Power Stone.
653373	663183	There's a lot of sexy shit coming out for the PSP, so I'm glad Jamie cleaned it so that it's ready to go for me when I get it back and can play the, you know, I want to play that Mega Man stuff and the...
664652	665913	Katamari Namashi, PSP.
666293	667794	It's going to be a good year for PSP.
667935	671338	So PSP fans, you can just stop writing those angry emails right now.
671878	672439	It'll be fine.
673099	675521	I'll rediscover my love for PSP.
675722	676122	Just wait.
676602	681747	Well, we've also, Dan's been playing Phoenix Wright like all the damn time.
682267	687232	So I've gotten to see like the fourth trial, the whole thing, because he kept making me watch it.
688010	691252	It was pretty cool, but I sort of don't need to play now because I know how it goes.
692853	701357	Between him and Roz spoiling it for me, I'm eventually going to play it, but I can just watch everybody else play it.
703138	709562	I think Dan finally beat Need for Speed Underground, so that was pretty cool.
711023	711683	He's been just...
713391	714392	Watch a lot of Simpsons
738488	745174	Yes, the replacement came about, not that long after I said, I think it took about two business days and I had it back.
745434	749058	So it came back pretty quick, but of course I wasn't here to enjoy it.
749118	751400	It's just, you know, Extifer, my roommate, told me it was here.
751740	757445	So when I got back from the trip, I played Xbox 360.
757605	759447	That's like a lot of what I've been doing this weekend.
759507	764151	And I saw Your Husband's High Score on Smash TV, because that's one of the games I checked out, Smash TV.
764711	767394	I've been playing like hell a lot of the stuff on the Xbox Live Arcade.
767414	770676	Crystal Quest, because I remember that game on the Mac from years ago.
771537	773199	Pretty cool reinterpretation.
773799	778303	Somebody said on our forums that the achievement points were really easy in that game, and I have to agree.
778744	781086	You want like 50 easy achievement points?
781126	781546	There you go.
782006	783888	I wasn't able to get good achievement points on that.
783908	786190	All you have to do, don't use a smart bomb and get all the way to level 30.
786811	790354	That's like 30 points right there for getting that far.
790414	790614	Anyway.
791380	793621	So there's that, and then what else did I play on there?
793962	796643	A little bit of Geometry Wars still, although I haven't gotten much better at that.
797103	800926	And I bought Full Auto, just because of all the good things I heard about it.
801326	806009	Not from critics, because a lot of critics have bashed it, but from word of mouth, a lot of people have been saying good things about Full Auto.
806049	806669	So I picked it up.
807230	808971	I have to say I'm enjoying it.
809051	813273	I haven't gotten to play a whole lot, but I like it so far.
813373	815935	It's racing with guns, which is never a bad thing.
816195	817696	Wait till you get to the end of the game.
817796	826284	Probably if you listened to last week's podcast, you would have heard me yelling and screaming about the game and saying, God damn it, I fucking hate this end part of the game.
826804	828846	The rewind feature is awesome.
829166	829827	I love that.
830127	832909	Like, if I screw up, I can just rewind time.
832969	833510	It's awesome.
834090	834851	More games need that.
834871	838214	Mario Kart needs that, especially online, because I screw up too much when I play online.
839201	842366	or when people disconnect, I'll just rewind so that they didn't actually disconnect.
843148	849858	Speaking of DS, I also picked up, this is a game I was so looking forward to, very excited about, Super Princess Peach on the DS.
851499	851879	I don't know.
853179	854980	I don't know if I'm really thrilled with this game.
855000	856280	It just wasn't what I expected.
856740	859681	And maybe that's my own damn fault because I didn't really read up on this game.
859721	862481	I just assumed, oh, it will be like Mario Brothers, but it will be Princess Peach.
862501	868022	Because I heard that Nintendo is trying to get back to their roots, especially with the new Mario DS games coming out.
868142	874744	I assumed that Princess Peach would be like, you know, it would be like, oh, it's like Mario 2, but on the DS.
874764	876064	Whoa, was I wrong.
876124	876384	Because...
877705	885308	This is kind of funny because the whole concept behind the game is that Princess Peach is totally emotionally unstable, like most women I know.
886229	887389	Just kidding.
887409	889330	You need to be quiet, Mr. Rob.
889790	890191	I'm kidding.
890231	897234	But seriously, the whole concept of the game is that Princess Peach is emotionally unstable, and you can set things on fire with her anger.
897614	899775	You can make the grass grow with her tears.
900335	905077	You can make her life regenerate with her calmness or acid trip.
905097	906378	I don't know what mood that's supposed to be.
907222	908163	The Power of Prozac
927597	934222	Peach doesn't feel like the same character that she is in the other Mario games and in Mario Party.
934562	939466	And I realize maybe part of this is to obviously make Peach the hero for once.
940167	946732	But if you've ever played Mario Party against me, you'll know that Peach is always the hero of Mario Party because I always play Peach and I always win.
948653	951235	I seem to have a memory of beating you before, sir.
951415	951916	Whatever.
952196	953297	Peach is always...
954170	954951	I played full auto.
955051	955972	I finished the game 100%.
956072	958954	I'm just getting the last few achievements online.
959014	959335	I've gotten...
982315	989878	I'm up on to rank 3 now online, because for some reason it's not counting all the ranked races I'm doing.
989978	998822	I raced about 6 different races today, and it only counted 2 of them, which ironically enough were the best ones I did, so that worked out in my favor.
999264	1003665	But still though, I spent all that time to play people and they freaking drop like mad.
1003765	1004466	It's crazy.
1004986	1006766	It's like Mario Kart but worse.
1007246	1008187	It's still really fun though.
1008947	1010807	And you get to play in some of the races.
1011408	1022311	I found my strategy though is the same during the multiplayer games as in my single player games where I drop a lot of bombs behind me and just get ahead of the pack and I just take people out as I'm driving.
1023091	1024011	And it worked really well.
1024071	1025452	I got in the first place that way.
1027068	1029009	But the game is really fun.
1030089	1035730	Really frustrating in the gang war section of the game, but I finally got gold on those.
1035790	1038071	And once I was done with that, I was like, finally.
1038351	1039792	Really rewarding.
1040752	1044813	Other than that, I've been trying to get into some more of the Xbox Live Arcade games.
1044893	1047954	Played a little bit more Hexic HD.
1048194	1051475	Trying to actually become good at that game, but I can't.
1052275	1055116	And tried Gauntlet and suck at Gauntlet still.
1055868	1057069	Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter
1079537	1080338	All right.
1080438	1084360	Speaking of gauntlets, since you brought up gauntlet in there, I'm going to go to our chat room now.
1084500	1084861	Finally.
1084921	1085741	Sorry, chat room.
1085841	1086862	I'm not ignoring you guys.
1086922	1087382	I know you're there.
1087923	1089644	www.orangelantrader.com.
1089664	1090304	Click on chat.
1090824	1091525	I'm not.
1091565	1091885	Don't just.
1092105	1092425	Lies.
1092826	1093366	Spitting lies.
1094487	1095507	Emotionally unstable woman.
1095888	1096128	All right.
1096728	1099770	I am not unstable.
1100171	1101451	Who touched the fire heart?
1101551	1102192	Who touched it?
1103939	1105881	I'm just teasing.
1106242	1106883	Alright, moving on.
1107944	1108464	Let's see.
1108585	1109886	Oh, question from chatroom.
1109926	1112689	Hitstun says, does Gauntlet have online play?
1113070	1113250	Yes.
1113290	1116554	Yes, and that is pretty much what makes pretty much...
1117888	1122529	It is what mucho makes these games worthwhile on Xbox Live.
1122630	1126551	Otherwise, I would say, frickin' go get Midway Arcade Classics.
1126811	1129112	It's got every single game they're offering on Live.
1130692	1134253	But the online play is what makes these worth the five bucks a pop.
1135213	1139835	It's sometimes hard to find an opponent, but it's fun.
1140175	1146057	And that's the only way that Gauntlet remains fun after the first few levels for me, honestly, is to have four people playing it.
1146497	1146677	So...
1147197	1152661	Definitely, you know, if you're wanting to get back into Gauntlet, check it out on Xbox Live because you can do the co-op thing.
1152841	1154082	So, pretty exciting.
1155142	1160286	If you guys want to participate, www.orangelonestradio.com Click on chat.
1162307	1164828	And of course, you guys are always free to disagree with us.
1165129	1168270	DMN says, I disagree with your opinion on Peach Sky.
1168671	1170432	Well, that's... And you know what?
1170472	1171352	My opinion might change.
1171452	1174754	I've changed my opinion on games when I go back and play them for a longer time.
1175074	1177335	As I'm sure some of you guys have done as well.
1177355	1182198	Sometimes, like a CD, a movie, you watch it, listen to it the first time, and you think, this sucks.
1182438	1183999	And you go back later, and it's actually really good.
1184059	1185400	Same thing happens with games all the time.
1185720	1187821	So, you know, I reserve the right to change my opinion.
1188061	1189582	Nothing is ever cemented.
1189642	1190463	But, I don't know.
1190743	1190963	I don't...
1191443	1193225	I can't see my opinion changing on this, but we'll see.
1193405	1193726	We'll see.
1196168	1200974	I have to say something about Katsukan, which is where I went part of my trip, where I was at.
1201354	1203857	I did a panel there on Bomani Games.
1204498	1206500	I was placed Sunday at 11 a.m.
1207661	1211706	I could count on my hands how many people showed up to my panel, and that made me kind of sad.
1212369	1213490	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1236795	1237616	Oh well, maybe next time.
1237696	1249623	We are thinking about going to other cons and stuff, so if you have suggestions, we can't go to everything, but if you, you know, especially California-based stuff, we can certainly try and make an attempt at going to, and I know we've got ideas of our own, so we'll see what happens.
1250403	1252845	Big thanks to those of you guys who did stop by and say hi at KatsuCon.
1253797	1259141	Also, a big, huge thank you to the listener who hooked me up with a Wonderswan color.
1259322	1260242	That was so awesome.
1260382	1261103	Did I tell you about that?
1261163	1262104	I got a Wonderswan color.
1262424	1263145	That's really cool.
1263185	1265126	And Final Fantasy IV.
1265166	1265887	That's so badass.
1266247	1266988	I love the Wonderswan color.
1267008	1268169	And you already know I love Final Fantasy IV.
1268189	1269009	I don't have to tell you again.
1270451	1271011	Alright, anyway.
1271471	1271912	Moving on.
1272773	1274814	Let's get into this week's news.
1274954	1276275	Starting off with Loki.
1276375	1276776	Loki...
1278866	1281127	You've got the hookup or something this week, don't you?
1281188	1282428	Loki, what's up?
1282528	1283889	Destination PlayStation.
1283989	1285270	This is a retail-only event.
1285310	1286171	That means no press.
1286671	1288292	But, being that I work in retail...
1289315	1290155	We did get the hookup.
1290456	1295398	I actually got the PowerPoint presentations of a few different companies that were going to be there showing off their games.
1295959	1297339	And we got a bunch of different titles.
1297399	1303963	As I mentioned last week, we did have some stuff regarding the Activision.
1304623	1309666	And now I have the Vividi Universal titles that are going to be coming out.
1310458	1310878	This year!
1311379	1314160	And a lot of this stuff hasn't been announced yet, so it's going to be kind of cool.
1314520	1318462	Including some of the Revolution games that are going to be coming out at launch.
1319103	1321964	But let me just run down the list here of some of the really cool stuff.
1322004	1335692	Just so you guys know, he's actually, and I know this is radio, so he's actually looking at a PowerPoint that I'm sure is not supposed to be looked at by us right now, but it shows, it's a freaking calendar that just shows, it looks very official, boys and girls, I...
1336653	1337193	This is great.
1337213	1338154	This is so cool.
1338394	1342717	Anyways, this is the exact PowerPoint that they're showing at Destination PlayStation, which is awesome.
1343117	1354163	But starting off here, well, upcoming this second quarter, we've got Over the Hedge and X-Men 3, which is no surprise, two games based on upcoming movies.
1355264	1359106	In July through September, third quarter,
1359568	1363629	We've got the movies X-Pack, which is coming out for the PC and expansion to the movies.
1363769	1364849	Now wait, I noticed something here.
1364869	1366129	Okay, take X3, for example.
1366249	1374791	I see it's bolded, and then I see the legend at the bottom says, Bold, Xbox 360, PS3, and or Nintendo, I guess NR means Nintendo Revolution.
1375131	1379412	So when it's bolded in April, May, June, is that like hinting, or is that just going to be Xbox 360?
1379472	1382453	It means that there's probably an Xbox 360 version for X-Men 3.
1382553	1384213	I see, because I get, look at that goat.
1384273	1385393	Does that mean we're going to have like a PS3?
1385633	1386714	No, no, no.
1386734	1387314	I didn't think so.
1388374	1396118	July, or quarter three, we've got, like I said, the movies X-Pac for the PC, Quake Enemy Territory for the PC, as well as a couple budget titles.
1396138	1400121	They have Kabbalah's Alaskan Adventures for both consoles and PC.
1401081	1404663	And let's see here, also for quarter four, of course, is going to be the biggest stuff.
1404843	1406324	And I see lots of bolded stuff here.
1406364	1407085	Lots of bold stuff.
1407105	1410266	So this must mean the other consoles, they're expecting them to be out this time.
1410306	1411547	Well, here's where we're going here.
1411627	1413228	We've got actual launch stuff.
1413849	1415109	Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam
1433275	1438218	Call of Duty 3 is going to be another title that's coming out on the PlayStation 3 and for the 360, which is going to be pretty cool.
1438238	1440339	Call of Duty, also, they're going to be getting a version for the PSP.
1462185	1464307	as well as Gun is coming to the PSP.
1464908	1467370	These are the bargain titles here.
1467510	1470313	The History Channel presents the Civil War, a first person shooter I might add.
1485061	1489485	So, I don't know exactly how that would work, because I know it takes a long-ass time to reload.
1489505	1491647	Civil War first-person shooter?
1491668	1492749	This shit's fake.
1492849	1493810	This has got to be fake.
1493830	1494550	No, that is not fake.
1494611	1495572	It's better than World War II.
1495592	1496352	Let me tell you a switch.
1496753	1498294	It was supposed to come out last year.
1498475	1499876	I have the sell sheets for this.
1500076	1504561	It looks like the biggest piece of crap I've ever seen, but it's a budget title.
1505974	1506455	It's weird.
1506675	1507115	It's really bad.
1507456	1510539	Harley Davidson, they're also doing another bike game.
1510559	1511099	I mean, come on.
1511119	1513942	They had American Choppers, the game.
1514002	1517065	So, of course, this one really got me laughing.
1517185	1518706	Pimp My Ride, the game.
1518806	1519327	Kill me.
1520328	1521409	Which, you know, I thought L.A.
1521489	1524211	Rush was Pimp My Ride, the game, but whatever.
1524272	1525793	That's coming out on consoles.
1526133	1527755	And Kabbalah's African Safari.
1527775	1530457	And, you know, sadly enough, people buy those Kabbalah's games a lot.
1533633	1536794	and some other games I should mention for the DS Spider-Man Kids.
1536935	1538255	I don't know what the hell that is.
1538936	1542678	A lot of really bad games.
1543178	1546920	That's everything for Civil War First Pursuiter.
1547300	1548981	You kind of have my interest now.
1549522	1553584	It sounds like one of those you-gotta-see-it-to-believe-it type things.
1554184	1557286	I can't be the only one who's interested in a very showgirls kind of way.
1559747	1564731	Now for Vividi Universal, we've got 50 Cent.
1564751	1567093	50 Cent's coming out on the PSP in fourth quarter.
1567433	1570576	Because a year later, the game's still going to suck.
1570636	1576261	Crash Festival, a Crash Bandicoot game for the DS, will be coming out also in fourth quarter.
1576281	1578182	I wonder whatever happened to Crash Bandicoot.
1578442	1579743	They still make games for that stuff.
1579763	1580064	I don't know.
1581588	1586550	You know the last one I ever played of Crash Bandicoot was the little party game they had on the PlayStation.
1587050	1588310	Crash Bash?
1588450	1589231	Yeah, Crash Bash.
1589591	1590231	What a crap.
1590731	1591952	What a crap that game was.
1591992	1592472	I'm sorry.
1592572	1594913	That was like the worst knockoff game I'd ever seen in my life.
1595333	1602195	I've got a game coming out called Eragon, which is going to be based on a movie that's coming out around the same time, quarter four.
1602855	1605776	Also on the 360 and all the console systems.
1606737	1607697	Actually, it's pretty sweet.
1607717	1609938	They've got John Malkovich in it.
1610138	1610998	It looks like he plays like a
1611963	1612683	A Troll or something.
1612783	1613104	I don't know.
1613664	1614665	That's kind of neat.
1615125	1622209	But it's definitely going to be a lot better than In the Name of the King and Uebo Crap Fest.
1623209	1623649	Let's see.
1623710	1625751	Of course, a bunch of other movie tie-ins here.
1625831	1628912	Miami Vice, of course, with the movie that's coming out.
1629233	1630313	Also a console game.
1630533	1630974	Moving on.
1631014	1632735	Scarface coming out in September.
1632795	1640739	That one actually looks pretty sweet because it's kind of, you know, it's like Vice City but actually, you know, without ripping off Scarface.
1641462	1641762	Spyro Deluxe
1665928	1667548	or Legend of Spyro A New Beginning.
1667668	1670789	And that's coming out in all the systems in October, actually.
1670809	1679111	See, I always thought Crash and Spyro ran away together to the land of oversaturation and made like a million babies or something.
1680552	1681712	Yeah, I don't know.
1681732	1686513	And then there's another crappy game here called Mach, which is for the PSP.
1686713	1688294	And it looks like crap.
1688654	1689774	Unless you like airplane fighting.
1689794	1691274	If you like airplane combat games.
1691314	1692955	Boom, boom, shoot them up, top gun.
1693115	1693515	But, uh...
1694304	1697125	Oh, and I forgot, I had EA's lineup too.
1697165	1697965	Just real quick, though.
1698085	1699946	There's only a couple that are worth mentioning.
1700566	1701307	They're anytime soon.
1701567	1703487	Superman Returns, coming out in June.
1703908	1705268	June 26th, currently.
1705728	1708109	Will it be based on the Superman 64 engine?
1708489	1709110	No, it will not be.
1709670	1710510	Actually, you know what?
1710750	1713171	I have seen the video for this.
1713311	1715592	They released a trailer for it, and it actually looks really good.
1715652	1718253	It's going to have 80 square miles of metropolis you get to fly around in.
1718753	1747718	and with all the buildings and everything and um really cool and they've got Metallo in there giant you know robot you get to fight and stuff and I don't know and then Lord of the Rings Battle for Middle Earth 2 um for Xbox 360 tentatively right now for June 13th speaking of the land of oversaturation now now sorry I've been gone for a couple weeks I'm a little feisty tonight that's all we got so far I'm still waiting to get back from uh
1748336	1753939	Because a lot of people right now, Destination PlayStation was taking place this week and a lot of people are still busy.
1754779	1756119	I'll get some more info later on.
1756780	1761362	You know, DarkTetsuya has an interesting point about the Civil War first person shooter.
1761922	1766344	If that is historically accurate, then you will be spending more time reloading than firing.
1766424	1766884	Exactly.
1768505	1773267	Do you remember seeing this in history class to put the powder back in the gun forever and all that stuff?
1775388	1777229	Make for some mean online play.
1779440	1779960	Think about that.
1780020	1782861	You have a 15 minute match, you can only fire 15 shots.
1784702	1785822	Better make those count.
1787403	1793945	Moving on, I noticed when I was gone, people got really freaked out about this Microsoft origami.
1794265	1794885	Like, you know, oh!
1795615	1795995	Here it is.
1796135	1798197	Microsoft's entering the handheld market.
1798377	1799038	Here it is.
1799118	1803021	The origami is their answer to the PSP and the DS, right?
1803761	1804502	Here's my thing, okay?
1804842	1805703	About the origami.
1805743	1807604	The origami is a stupid name.
1807624	1808045	I'm sorry.
1808305	1809726	Because it makes me want to fold it.
1809786	1810526	And you don't do that.
1810586	1812428	You don't fold a Microsoft equipment.
1812448	1813829	Here's the thing about the origami, though.
1813969	1815150	It reminds me of, like,
1815666	1817008	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1830834	1833978	I can't stick it in a pocket unless I'm like 5 billion pounds and have pants the size of, you know.
1848553	1849795	A parachute or something.
1849855	1851457	The Microsoft doorstop.
1851738	1852439	Now with Halo.
1854281	1855583	By the way, it doesn't play Halo.
1855643	1856625	Here it is, kids.
1856785	1857466	Here it is.
1858007	1863895	Now the word's coming out that it is not actually their answer to the PSP or DS.
1863915	1864496	So sit down.
1865151	1870773	Because what this is, is actually it is their first in a line of paperback-sized computers.
1871414	1873314	So what the hell was the Halo thing?
1873674	1876115	It was running Halo on Windows XP, is what they say.
1876255	1877856	Because it's like a portable computer.
1878636	1879817	Paperback size?
1879997	1883258	Okay, I know what the size of a paperback book is.
1883278	1886159	If this thing is like the paperback size of a phone book.
1886359	1888880	Apparently the paperback in question is War and Peace.
1889181	1889681	Apparently.
1892042	1892482	I don't know.
1893582	1897926	The Bible.
1898366	1901469	With the Book of Mormon as the AC adapter or something.
1901689	1905312	No, it's the size of the unabridged dictionary.
1906173	1917363	Anyway, all kidding aside, Microsoft's going to have this tiny, and I use that term very loosely, tiny computer coming out soon called the Origami.
1917423	1917803	But you know...
1920368	1935691	People are saying it's not a handheld, but correct me if I'm wrong, if the damn thing hooks up to all of Microsoft's other stuff, couldn't you theoretically get some perks as an origami owner, such as maybe Xbox 360 demos, movies on your origami?
1935991	1938651	Couldn't that still be something that's an option?
1938871	1940872	Oh, of course, you earn the ridicule of all your friends.
1941132	1941912	This made me laugh.
1942012	1948273	Okay, Game Informer is trying to guess what you could use the origami for, and one of the things they said is a secondary screen for your 360.
1949138	1957504	I'm like, yeah, I'm going to go out there and spend $500 on a crappy little screen that could possibly be used in a game as a status screen or something like a DS.
1958464	1958785	No.
1959205	1961006	I'll tell you what the origami can be used for.
1961607	1962887	Ah, shit, I got a crooked nail.
1966390	1967210	You killed the penguin.
1970524	1973527	People out in the living room are probably going, what the hell are they doing on that show tonight?
1973547	1975609	Well, you know what?
1975629	1981835	If someone could be bludgeoned to death with an iPod, man, that origami is giving me some deadly stuff there.
1984818	1990144	Well, you know, since you pissed off enough Mac users, we'll get the hate mail from Microsoft fans this week.
1990204	1991365	It's just, you know, turnabout's fair play.
1992762	1993903	DarkSakura, World of Warcraft
2021337	2025140	In addition to, what's the other three languages they have out in Europe right now?
2025340	2025580	Yeah.
2026221	2029023	So, uh, we get the Spanish version!
2030444	2031785	El Computer Es En Fuego.
2034562	2036203	Lucha Libre on Telemundo
2051574	2053835	Loki, you also have a WoW story.
2078632	2083874	Yes, this is how you can become part of the beta for the World of Warcraft Burning Crusade.
2083914	2085674	And no, that's not an STD.
2086415	2088215	They have three different things that are going to be going on.
2088255	2091816	The first is a race to level 50 contest.
2091896	2093757	And that's basically just like it sounds.
2093817	2097198	You take a new character and see how quickly you can get to level 50.
2098619	2105301	And hopefully the top 1,000 will secure the right to be able to be part of the beta.
2106036	2109518	The second competition is called the Battle for Warsong Gulch.
2110358	2114360	It's basically a level 19 capped battle.
2117721	2123723	The top 500 players for that are going to be able to be part of the beta for that.
2124524	2128646	Finally, the most level 25 characters contest.
2128746	2134128	Just like it sounds, the top 1,000 people who can get the most characters that are level 25 and above
2135131	2136191	Get to also be part of the beta
2164008	2166312	I just found a reason to take my vacation time.
2166452	2166933	I'm happy.
2167013	2167394	Nerd.
2167835	2168676	Alright, moving on.
2168916	2170479	I also have a WoW story.
2170519	2174887	You know how the rumors are going around that World of Warcraft is going to come out on the Xbox 360?
2174927	2175007	Not.
2175027	2175087	Not.
2179235	2197306	So even though Squeenix is bringing over Final Fantasy XI to the 360, MCV, the Interactive Entertainment Weekly, is saying that the Blizzard Chief Operating Officer, Paul Sam, said, "...we do not have any plans to take WoW to Xbox 360.
2197726	2200888	WoW is built as a PC gaming experience.
2201488	2208413	Porting PC games to console often compromises games, and we would never allow the WoW gameplay experience to suffer."
2209173	2211435	So, it doesn't sound like it's going to happen.
2211475	2217720	To counter that, according to the VOIP blog, World of Warcraft is indeed going to debut on the 360.
2217760	2228328	This is, of course, coming about a day after they announced that it wasn't, and apparently the whole thing is they're going to announce some sort of secret partnership at E3.
2228529	2232952	Of course, that sounds like a bunch of fan-based speculation to me.
2234533	2237556	With all due respect to that blog in question, blog...
2238345	2240327	Chief Operating Officer of Blizzard.
2240467	2242328	It's hard to say which one's more believable.
2242568	2246552	But you know, it's not like these guys haven't lied before.
2246692	2253097	To the blog's credit, they could totally make a 180 on this statement and we would just look like asses again.
2256200	2256660	Moving on.
2257102	2257642	New story.
2258463	2258903	Loki.
2259544	2261625	We were talking about Gauntlet on Xbox Live Arcade.
2261905	2263006	The fun ain't done yet, right?
2263466	2264247	Of course not.
2264307	2267969	There's going to be some more Midway games coming to the Xbox Live Arcade.
2268069	2268710	One of my favorites.
2268770	2269350	Paperboy.
2269770	2270971	Paperboy is coming.
2271552	2272012	Of course.
2272272	2273293	And Roopier Tapper.
2273913	2274794	That's going to be really good.
2274814	2275834	Dude, I own it, that game.
2275934	2276415	It's on.
2277000	2278502	But Rupert Tapper's not really two-player.
2278522	2279443	It's not two-player co-op.
2279743	2283787	So I don't think they're going to have to get creative with that one to make that a worthwhile purchase.
2283827	2284688	Same thing with Paperboy.
2284728	2292916	They weren't really, you know, the enticing thing about the Midway games is that they're co-op and stuff, but those games aren't really multiplayer at once.
2293097	2294938	Defender is also coming.
2295679	2299803	Some other stuff that will be heading our way is going to be Cyberball.
2301203	2303710	Some sort of robot football game.
2303810	2306939	And then finally, of course, the best one.
2307398	2311639	Mortal Kombat 3, or Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, is going to be coming.
2311899	2315200	To combat, of course, Street Fighter 2.
2315421	2316861	Why Mortal Kombat 3?
2317461	2319862	Which I would say is the worst one in the entire series.
2320042	2322483	Sorry, I even prefer Mortal Kombat 4 over Mortal Kombat 3.
2322523	2324463	Mortal Kombat 2 is the top of the series.
2324483	2325704	I know, Mortal Kombat 2 is the top.
2326004	2327164	I don't think there's any dispute in that.
2327184	2331285	But I even prefer, and I know people totally disagree, I prefer Mortal Kombat 4 to 3.
2331365	2332346	I did not like 3 at all.
2332746	2332986	It just...
2334463	2339065	The beta versions of Mortal Kombat 2 Mortal Kombat 2 is awesome Why 3?
2339705	2340366	Why are they coming out with 3?
2340566	2340826	Why not 2?
2341146	2354451	People want 2 I don't know Be glad you're getting any Mortal Kombat I'm not spending $5 on Mortal Kombat 3 Especially when I already have Arcade Legends 2 Who says it's going to be $5?
2354491	2361594	Watch when Street Fighter 2 comes out I bet you it'll probably be like $10 F that Pretty soon you'll be paying for $40 games online
2366716	2367197	Moving on.
2368258	2375064	DarkSakura has a story about parents and video games and all that fun stuff.
2375264	2376345	What's up?
2378207	2379528	Parents and video games.
2379729	2386435	Well, video games' worst enemy is lazy parents.
2387075	2388757	How many times have I said this?
2389718	2390399	I know, I'm kind of like...
2391070	2393832	Even when I was looking over this week's story, I was kind of like, this is news.
2394132	2403076	But it's nice to see that the media is kind of acknowledging that it's not always doom and gloom, the gamer's fault.
2404377	2407339	Everybody is equally to blame sometimes.
2407499	2407819	I don't know.
2409440	2410981	Well, there's this...
2414162	2428147	legislation going into actually and this is actually something else I was reading on a number of sites there's actually new legislation to have the game ratings redone which is actually pretty stupid a lot of people are protesting it
2428519	2435165	Well, I think it's okay if they want to do it like we've suggested on this program before, and I think it's the way they do it in the UK, if I'm not mistaken.
2435185	2436366	That's what I'm talking about in the UK.
2436626	2437026	Oh, oh.
2437587	2438888	Oh, in the UK it's fine.
2438928	2440269	Doesn't it mirror the movies in the UK?
2440349	2446314	It does, but there's one of the Labour Party folks is lobbying to change it.
2446434	2450097	Why would you change it when I think that's the way that makes the most sense, is to mirror the movies?
2450217	2451999	Because people understand movie ratings.
2452059	2456783	They don't understand, for whatever reason, they don't understand game ratings, but they understand PG-13 ratings.
2457643	2460226	Okay, R, might have titties, don't take the kids.
2461367	2465150	Well, now they're having this mom's army business over there.
2465691	2466552	Mom as in mother.
2468514	2470916	With what little I know of British culture, I do know that one.
2470936	2472537	I'm just teasing.
2472557	2473678	Well, not everyone does.
2474419	2482266	But they're saying that the games are responsible for all kinds of social problems like drug and alcohol abuse, gang membership, and...
2483960	2484720	Gangsta Rap.
2488402	2491163	Dude, I'm going to play some Katamari Damashio.
2493544	2509052	But seriously, there was, there's actually an interesting comment on here that's a political movement launched by the same people who show a story of a woman crippled by 40 to 60 orgasms a day.
2510932	2511953	How can that be credible?
2514025	2514986	It's kind of awesome.
2515306	2520990	That's like reading The Sun or something, you know, or like The Inquirer.
2521671	2522652	Alright, well.
2522812	2533800	But they're saying that video games which, to quote, glorify pimping, drug dealing, and street murders, but they don't make a logical connection to trying to control what their children are playing.
2533840	2539525	Basically, they're blaming the games, not blaming themselves for taking responsibility for what their children are doing.
2540245	2540926	Excuse me!
2542159	2552887	We've been doing this show for four years, and didn't I say that from like, well, not quite day one, but sort of around, you know, the first year I started my whole campaign against parents doing their freaking job?
2553287	2558451	That's what makes this news, is that finally, you know, there's, you know, anyway.
2558851	2559552	It's ridiculous.
2559632	2560653	It really is ridiculous.
2560913	2565016	And honestly, I feel like writing them and going, why don't you just try parenting your children?
2566601	2567361	Moving on.
2567401	2571964	Now, on the flip side, we have a good piece about parenting and stuff later.
2572084	2575925	So please, if you're going to send hate mail right now, wait, because we have another story coming up later.
2575945	2584009	I've fully gone on and said, for those of you parents who are taking an active part in your children, it's a partnership.
2584109	2591373	They have a responsibility to put the information out there and market it correctly, but the parents have the responsibility to take that information and use it wisely.
2591653	2591993	There you go.
2594577	2596358	Something that may not be so wise.
2596918	2597518	I caught this.
2597598	2600940	It's a little piece on Kotaku this week.
2601020	2601901	Little, little piece.
2602481	2604122	And that's about all the N-Gage deserves.
2604262	2606403	In fact, I thought the N-Gage was dead and gone, but no.
2607903	2611185	Civilization just recently came out on the N-Gage this week.
2611485	2614887	And I seem to remember playing this at E3 last year.
2615527	2616688	I got so frustrated.
2616728	2619910	Civilization is probably my favorite computer game of all time.
2619951	2623213	And granted, I think this one's based off of Civ 2, the Civ 2 engine.
2623653	2625735	I got frustrated after like two minutes.
2625955	2627856	I couldn't, I could not stand.
2627957	2629578	I was like, what happened to my game?
2629898	2630939	What, why?
2631079	2632140	Why, God, why?
2632700	2634481	I was like crying in the middle of the engage booth.
2634521	2635202	I had to be removed.
2636223	2646192	But anyway, if you're a Civ fan and you happen to own an N-Gage, or you need a reason to, you know, keep your N-Gage, or need something on your... I guess, here it is, Civilization, finally out.
2646752	2652217	Enjoy, and then, you know, kick your N-Gage, because it's, you know, not that great.
2653458	2654279	Moving on, Loki!
2655780	2656140	Yes.
2658122	2661245	Interesting story, actually, coming out about the Sims.
2663504	2669688	and basically EA and Depeche Mode have collaborated on a signature song for Sims 2, open for business.
2670528	2686618	And it's actually funny because this song playing, or I guess the first ever Simlish language song, Suffer Well, a popular track by Depeche Mode, will be in the game.
2687098	2689700	And I don't know how...
2690307	2692928	How you can listen to Depeche Mode in that weird language.
2692968	2693688	That's just weird.
2695389	2695869	It's unusual.
2696089	2696450	I don't know.
2697110	2698390	That's a weird pairing to me.
2698430	2699991	Depeche Mode in The Sims.
2700151	2700511	I don't know.
2701032	2703212	It worked for the Black Eyed Peas.
2703633	2706834	Okay, Depeche Mode, Black Eyed Peas, not quite the same type of band.
2707874	2710416	It might have worked better if they had picked a good Depeche Mode song.
2710896	2711376	Yeah, I know.
2712099	2714600	But there haven't been any good Depeche Mode songs in the past 10 years.
2714620	2717181	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
2717241	2721963	Now my question is... The last album was really freaking good, okay?
2722283	2723523	Now my question is... Violator?
2723543	2724584	Yeah, Violator.
2725544	2727465	I'm going to hit Rob with something.
2727925	2739109	Okay, my question is, is this song for like, since this is basically the storefront Sims expansion, is this for the Hot Topic?
2739963	2743764	You know, the type of story that's going to be in the game, you know, where you get to... I don't know.
2744604	2745164	I got nothing.
2745324	2745644	Okay.
2745804	2753746	Well, I find it interesting because I remember the Black Eyed Peas did a Simlish song for the Herbs games, and I don't recall that having any great success.
2754387	2756287	I'm curious why they would try this sort of thing again.
2757907	2762268	Because Depeche Mode was like, Our last album sucks so bad!
2762368	2763729	Please, someone listen to it!
2763749	2765289	Dave, he's going to shove a mic up your butt.
2765429	2768430	I mean, it's... All right.
2769028	2773992	Let's let Jamie have a witty retort here at this time with her website of the week.
2774092	2775734	Yay, we love Jamie's website of the week.
2775954	2777195	My website of the week.
2777235	2777555	Wait, wait.
2777575	2778136	Theme music.
2778896	2779316	There we go.
2779557	2781598	I was trying to make a comment before you started that.
2782259	2782699	Oh, sorry.
2782779	2783040	Go ahead.
2783100	2784621	It's just especially significant.
2790806	2796551	Today's website of the week is the website for Warp 11 because they rock.
2797508	2797788	Warp11.com
2826670	2827070	Wow.
2828751	2834152	There's actually, I think, a song that's just about various drugs in Star Trek.
2835853	2839474	And, of course, they did the best, my favorite of their songs, they did Montalban.
2839514	2848157	Have you ever seen that old Saturday Night Live sketch with William Shatner going to the Star Trek convention and he goes, Hey, you, in the back, have you ever gotten laid?
2848177	2849697	Remember that?
2850277	2850817	Hilarious.
2850857	2851118	Sorry.
2851498	2853698	Sorry, I didn't mean to intrude on the website.
2853718	2855639	Trick fans get laid with each other.
2856423	2863146	This band is also really... I'm a closet Trekkie.
2863186	2863786	Here we go.
2864766	2866387	I will make you feel better, okay?
2866407	2867708	Because I've been pretty harsh tonight.
2867748	2871269	I'm going to give you the greatest blackmail ammo of all time.
2871289	2871709	Are you ready?
2872550	2876471	In high school, senior year, I was vice president of the Star Trek Club.
2876871	2877312	Trekkie!
2877352	2877832	There you go.
2878992	2879532	Do you feel better?
2879773	2880653	I feel somewhat better.
2881397	2903163	but um but no just like freaking go look at the on the link for music it has the lyrics to Montalban up there it's like the best lyrics ever and there's also um mp3 samples on the site which you know we should we'll play eventually I actually on my show I play a lot of warp 11 anyway because I love warp 11
2904242	2909605	and I think that off of their most recent album which is called Boldly Go Down On Me.
2911286	2913887	Welcome to Our Cube is probably my favorite song on there.
2913907	2915568	That one and Captain Caught Me on the Holodeck.
2917148	2921110	Red Alert is also a really good album just because of Seven of Mine.
2922931	2926393	It's such a really, really cool band.
2927053	2929414	I will say this and to kind of bring it back to gaming a little bit.
2929434	2930375	They're also in Trekkies too.
2931204	2950932	to bring it back to gaming a little bit I do think that Star Trek MMO is a pretty good idea I think that'll be great so we'll see when more details come out I think it'll be pretty cool one other thing I'd like to point out about the site everyone should go to the photos and look at the Halloween photos with them dressed as Star Wars characters
2953681	2956263	Alright, DarkSakura's website of the week, enjoy.
2957584	2961826	Moving on, this article's kind of been floating around the internet for a couple weeks.
2961866	2965369	Keep in mind, we haven't done a show in a couple weeks, so we have to catch up on a couple things that we missed.
2965749	2968171	But this was run on MSNBC Newsweek.
2969671	2973814	This is interesting, there's a game coming out, it's called Left Behind Eternal Forces.
2974315	2976256	Left Behind is this...
2976846	2983328	Book series of, I guess they're Christian-oriented books about what the rapture and the people to get left behind, right?
2984129	2993372	So basically what happens is that it's supposed to be taking place in Manhattan, but the level of violence is supposed to be reminiscent of Grand Theft Auto, according to this story.
2993752	2996713	It's about New Yorkers who are left behind after the rapture.
2997593	3001414	They scour the streets for converts, train...
3003115	3016162	People to be a workforce to feed, shelter, and join the resistance against the growing forces of the Antichrist is what this game is all about, which meets with a resounding okay?
3016502	3017563	Yeah, that sounds like a good title.
3018937	3020198	I know, it's just kind of like, oh really?
3021039	3023701	It sounds like GTA meets Shin Megami Tensai.
3023781	3024941	I'm almost interested.
3025001	3029545	Where's the part about getting the hooker in the car and then killing her?
3029605	3030505	I mean, where's that?
3030785	3038151	If this game does not have a sex minigame that was removed from the game but still left in the programming, I will not buy it.
3039512	3041133	Instead of hot coffee, it's hot mana.
3043134	3045596	Hopefully this game will be less boring than the movie.
3046471	3048152	And yes, I have watched the movie.
3048672	3050914	And God, I want those two hours back.
3052315	3057618	Speaking of stories that are a little bit old, but we want to bring them to your attention anyway.
3057658	3057938	Loki?
3060500	3064202	Anyways, there is a little bit of news going around.
3064222	3065543	I won't even really call this news.
3065823	3067924	The EA Sports Games for the PSP.
3068164	3070686	In order to play online, you have to do one of two things.
3070726	3074949	You have to either sign over your privacy to...
3076420	3081384	EA, and I believe ESPN to have them send you spam or pay them $2.
3083766	3084927	And so, yeah.
3086028	3091452	This has been going on and basically brought to attention again with the release of Fight Night Round 3.
3092213	3105844	But this is something that's going on since... So, what's to stop me from going to get a free Gmail account because I know thousands of people with thousands of invites to Gmail even though it's still in beta.
3106212	3113014	What's to stop me from getting a free Gmail account and having it be my spam dump ground and signing up with this address?
3114874	3116975	Listen, it's all about the principle here.
3117735	3119675	Sure, it'd be really easy to do that.
3120535	3122636	And sure, probably lots of people have done that.
3122716	3126657	And sure, even the people that have put the legitimate information haven't gotten anything sent to them.
3128579	3130100	But yeah, it's about the principle.
3130400	3131440	It's the principle of the thing.
3131500	3133901	It's like, you know, $2 or my email address.
3133961	3136062	It's like, sell your soul to the marketing.
3136442	3138343	Sell your soul to the band is essentially what they're saying.
3138883	3139604	Or buy it back for $2.
3139684	3143645	Well, the whole thing it comes down to is this isn't something that's like on the box.
3143985	3151828	You know, it's kind of to hide that in there saying, oh yeah, by the way, if you want to play online, you got to pay us $2.
3152409	3155010	You know, that's kind of not good.
3155270	3155590	Shady.
3156250	3156870	Shady.
3157811	3158171	You know what?
3158561	3165543	It's just like re-releasing games onto the 360 without really doing much other than enhancing the textures a little bit.
3165883	3172405	Yeah, we see you with Burnout, and for that, EA's going to get left behind.
3172685	3178947	Battlefield 2, Gun, and half the 360 games out there.
3181307	3182888	But really, the bigger question is,
3184119	3185800	Why are you buying these sports games anyways?
3185860	3187400	No one plays sports games out there.
3187420	3191042	Because there's a huge... Don't you know, like, some of the most successful titles over here are sports games?
3191062	3192183	We don't talk about them so much.
3192203	3193383	There's a huge audience as well.
3193403	3197185	Well, like, some of the other titles you mentioned were, like, NHL, you know, 2006.
3197305	3198886	I'm like, who plays hockey games?
3198986	3199506	I mean, really?
3199526	3204808	Hey, hockey... Hey, Blades of Steel was, like, one of my favorite NES titles ever.
3204928	3205468	So shut your mouth.
3205488	3206389	That was Nintendo.
3206969	3212412	Well, my favorite thing was, how the hell did they have a hockey game anyways when there wasn't a season in 2005?
3212812	3217835	I still like Super Baseball 3000 for the Neo Geo.
3218115	3220976	One of the best things about the Genesis was NHL, okay?
3222377	3222697	Pwned.
3224858	3226079	Oh, I'm sorry!
3226459	3228300	Pull the Canadian card on me, why don't ya?
3230687	3233288	DarkSakura, please take us to a more reasonable time.
3233548	3235329	Did I mention we're just a little off tonight?
3237149	3238189	I'm always on.
3238289	3239050	I am so on.
3239090	3243851	All right, then get us back on track with a reasonable article here.
3243871	3245352	Oh, this is something we brought up earlier, yes?
3246592	3255955	Well, this is about parenting and about video games, as in gamer parents, which I'm going to be one day.
3256835	3263498	You know, in fact, I actually wrote a nice little rant not too long ago about gamer parents playing with their children.
3263998	3278645	But there's a lovely little bit of writing out about gamer parents and about how through them actually taking an active role in the games that their children play, they're taking responsibility.
3279085	3283407	They're bringing on a new generation of gamers who have that same healthy attitude, I think.
3285168	3285548	And you know,
3286579	3294102	Instead of leaving it just as a babysitting tool, it's to balance.
3294882	3303625	That's a big theme in this is that parents are using this as a tool to help teach their children and not as a babysitting device.
3304472	3306753	Some of my fondest memories from being a child.
3307293	3310634	Understand that my mother is definitely not a gamer.
3310974	3313155	She doesn't even really know how to turn a computer on.
3313215	3318177	If she needed something done on the computer, my dad or myself got asked to do it.
3318217	3322018	Some of the best memories I have of childhood was when she would...
3323154	3325576	My mom and I used to take turns playing Super Mario Bros.
3350970	3354013	That was also how I developed my blindfold level 8-1 skill.
3355234	3355614	Wow.
3356075	3356555	That's hot.
3357496	3358477	I can't do it anymore.
3358517	3360318	I mean, it's been way too long since I've done it.
3360779	3365763	But level 8-1, there's like a definite pattern to the whole stage and it is possible to do it blindfolded.
3365903	3368025	There's a pattern really to the whole game, right?
3368305	3371308	Well, not if you have, not for the Hammer Brother levels because they're all random.
3371648	3372149	Oh, that's true.
3372289	3375151	Their patterns are random, but you can do level 8-1 blindfolded.
3375351	3376633	You can do the first level blindfolded too.
3376653	3377013	Huh.
3377577	3380898	But yeah, but anyway, that's how I, you know, I learned that by playing with my mom.
3381819	3382299	Very cool.
3383399	3384980	Alright, let's see.
3385100	3385640	Moving on.
3385981	3386621	Loki!
3387421	3387701	Yes.
3388081	3389702	What's going on over at Konami?
3389742	3390683	Our buddies at Konami.
3391403	3398266	You know, I had to laugh when I read this news about Konami getting in trouble with the Crime Life advertisement.
3398326	3401107	First off, the advertisement isn't really that bad anyways.
3401167	3402688	It's just people overreacting again.
3403448	3405929	But, anyways, the whole, you know,
3407332	3407592	DarkSakura
3423459	3432010	The Advertising Standards Authority upheld the complaint against it and wanted them to pull it.
3432871	3439340	I think it's really stupid because when you look at it, most of the advertisements that we see nowadays are just
3440006	3440306	Nothing.
3440466	3445789	And I don't think that they really take violence and nudity and stuff like that seriously over in the UK.
3445989	3452032	At least not as much as we, I mean, we're just like completely conservative about everything, you know, whereas they're more liberal about it.
3452172	3453833	I was going to say rabid, but, you know.
3454073	3456335	Shouldn't Konami just write off Crime Life at this point?
3456395	3456975	I mean, really?
3457255	3458916	Is this a title they need to be backing?
3460313	3460613	No.
3461034	3463975	It was one of those, like, let's pay the rent this month type titles.
3464056	3465096	Let me put it this way.
3465116	3467538	The game initially was going to come out at about $49.99.
3467778	3469979	They dropped it to $20.
3470660	3474162	And then the reviews on it just sucked.
3474382	3482788	So it was a nice try, but, you know, just like Nintendo wrote off the Virtual Boy.
3482808	3484969	A travesty.
3485690	3487991	You just got to take your mistakes and say, you know what?
3488452	3489092	We messed up.
3490157	3490457	All right.
3491498	3493860	Well, we've been in a bit of a feisty mood tonight.
3494881	3500266	One reason for that is we're really excited about something as well that's going on here at Orange Lounge Radio.
3500747	3506992	And to help us talk about what's going on here at Orange Lounge Radio tonight, we decided to invite on a very special guest.
3507392	3511476	We always talk about support independent podcasting, support podcasters.
3511516	3512117	We're here to...
3512857	3517360	Back up what other folks do out there in the independent podcast revolution.
3517660	3520923	We would not exist without the support of other folks out there.
3521443	3529548	And one of the folks that's always been very supportive of our show, and we just love him to death, is the one and only Bobby Blackwolf from the Bobby Blackwolf Show over at AllGames.com.
3529788	3531169	And he's actually on the line with us right now.
3531229	3531850	Bobby, you there?
3532470	3532951	Yeah, I am.
3532971	3533911	How are you?
3534191	3534512	Good.
3534552	3535192	How are you, Bobby?
3535212	3536013	How was your show tonight?
3536053	3536353	Good one?
3537119	3537879	Yeah, it went pretty good.
3538380	3547945	It's interesting because Bobby and I, we tape almost the exact same time, but it's just because we've done it that way for a long time, so it just kind of works out that way, funny sometimes.
3548205	3554048	But you can download his show as a podcast just like you can download ours, so it allows you to stay in touch with both of them, so it's awesome.
3554629	3558931	All right, so Bobby, tell us first off a little bit about allgames.com.
3558951	3560312	What is this website that you're a part of?
3561539	3564584	Okay, well, it's a sequel to Left Behind.
3564845	3565446	No, I'm just kidding.
3566648	3570795	Somebody else is feeling a little feisty tonight.
3571256	3571436	Sorry.
3573038	3575980	Allgames.com was started by Scott Rubin about 10 years ago.
3576000	3580504	A lot of people here may recognize the name Scott Rubin from G4TV.com.
3580564	3581865	He was the original male host.
3582786	3591433	Before then, he ran the Allgames Network, which started off doing radio, a weekly radio show in real audio back in 1996.
3592754	3600621	Then he joined up with Pseudo Online Interactive to do kind of an IPTV network, is what it would be called today, using real video.
3601341	3604682	and he oversaw 15 hours worth of gaming content a week.
3605162	3607143	A daily live show and all that stuff.
3607443	3612984	That's hardcore because real audio and real video, like streaming and stuff, that stuff was a pain in the ass.
3613144	3615645	I mean, that's what our college radio station used to use.
3615965	3616905	That stuff was a pain.
3616985	3619086	So I know that takes a lot of dedication.
3620006	3622367	Apple made it easy for people to podcast in comparison.
3623627	3623827	Yeah.
3624347	3627328	Unfortunately, the dot-com bust came out and...
3628413	3631515	All Games Network died, pretty much, in the .com bust.
3632095	3635217	And then Comcast brought him over to help start G4.
3635237	3642141	So he moved out to Los Angeles, started G4, thought that they were going to be taking all these risks with gaming television programming.
3642741	3645183	And unfortunately, they just didn't understand.
3645903	3650566	And in about 2004, he said, okay, their vision is gone.
3650606	3652247	They're going in a completely different direction.
3652827	3653367	I want out.
3653587	3654388	And so he got out.
3655205	3656465	relaunched allgames.com.
3656525	3657826	Now he has a production company.
3657866	3662707	He's developing television, radio, and internet content all devoted to gaming.
3663648	3665308	And All Games Radio is one of those parts.
3666049	3666289	Awesome.
3666329	3668409	Now what's your involvement with all of this then?
3669250	3672651	Okay, well I've been a fan of Scott Rubin's work.
3672991	3675312	I've been listening to his stuff and watching his stuff since 97.
3675412	3677972	I went over, worked with G4.
3678153	3682594	I was actually a moderator on their forums back when G4 actually was good.
3683246	3686289	which they're not... Ancient history.
3688832	3693477	And so when he relaunched AllGames.com, I really kind of was in the right place at the right time.
3693517	3700064	I'd been around long enough, and he basically let me help him with his site, with his forums, and then he had a live 365 station.
3700164	3701546	I'm like, hey, let me do a show.
3702724	3708068	I did a show in 2004, and we had the MP3 archives of the show, which is what it was called.
3708228	3710129	The podcasting was very new.
3710969	3714572	Now, we actually have All Games Radio as a 24-7 music station.
3714692	3717013	I pretty much run it.
3717814	3728000	We play game music, or we play talk programming, either his show, which is every weeknight, live from the Arena Interactive Lounge in Santa Monica, or my show on Sunday nights.
3728820	3736868	This arena interactive lounge sounds pretty awesome because it sounds like a place where you can just kind of go and like just kind of like kick back, have a beer, play some games.
3736908	3738430	Here's Scott over there doing a show.
3739070	3739711	Sounds pretty awesome.
3739771	3740852	Wait, I guess you can't really have a beer.
3740872	3741773	This is California, huh?
3742033	3743295	Okay, have a root beer.
3743795	3745016	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
3745957	3746678	Here's what you do.
3747579	3748319	It's BYOB.
3749820	3751321	If you bring your own, you can have it there.
3751542	3751822	Okay.
3751862	3752823	And they'll store it for you.
3752943	3753303	There you go.
3753623	3760889	Maybe during E3, me and Jamie and Loki will all come with some Guinness and game it up right.
3761089	3763491	It'd be quite expensive on my part.
3763551	3763911	All right.
3764071	3766333	Well, anyway, so you have a show over on All Games.
3766373	3767394	What's your show all about?
3767414	3768655	What's the Bobby Blackwolf show about?
3769596	3771117	It's a one-person show.
3773639	3779986	We talk about news, we have a toll-free number that people can call in with Skype.
3780527	3783129	And basically just running down the news, and I do some interviews.
3783810	3787033	We had Tommy Tallarico on the show last week for about an hour and a half.
3787994	3789255	We even asked a question from you.
3789575	3789875	I know.
3789975	3791536	I actually listened to the show.
3791576	3794278	This was weird for me because we didn't have Orange Lounge Radio last week.
3794338	3796059	I was kind of like, hmm, what am I going to do tonight?
3796099	3798200	I can't really listen to my own show because there is no show.
3798460	3799421	I'll go listen to Bobby's show.
3799441	3801502	I never get a chance to listen to Bobby's show live.
3801522	3804143	I want to see how it is live versus taped.
3804483	3813809	And he had Tommy Tallarico on, and I thought that was kind of crazy because we've been known to give Tommy a little bit of a hard time here on this program.
3813829	3813969	Yeah.
3814749	3815369	Just a little bit.
3815729	3816490	So it was kind of funny.
3816570	3818230	So you know I had to ask a question.
3818310	3821171	And you know, Loki, where do you think I went?
3821311	3823772	Of all the Tommy Tallarico things, what do you think I had to ask about?
3825092	3826232	Remember what else he's involved in.
3826952	3830433	He was involved in a lot of things, actually.
3830613	3830853	Right.
3830933	3832294	But the music stuff.
3832454	3832594	Right.
3832634	3833874	Video games live, of course.
3834274	3836635	So if I had to ask him any question about video games live, what do you think I brought up?
3838829	3839590	I don't even know.
3840370	3840890	It was Pong.
3841110	3842251	I had to ask, why Pong?
3842631	3843032	Why Pong?
3843272	3849996	And of course he said, basically his ten minute answer or whatever it was, basically boiled down to, dude, it's eight seconds of Pong.
3851058	3851698	Thanks for watching!
3869530	3871352	I was like, God damn it, that show sucked.
3871572	3872373	It's not his fault.
3873394	3874295	It's the writers.
3874375	3876097	Do you know what I learned about that show?
3876137	3877138	Well, I don't know if I should say.
3877238	3878679	Let's get back on topic here.
3879240	3879840	Please.
3880441	3884745	So you have your program and you get some pretty cool interviews once in a while, yeah?
3885526	3886126	Yep, pretty much.
3886406	3888709	All right, so give us the details real quick.
3888749	3890150	How can we tune into your show if we want to hear it?
3890990	3891931	AllGamesRadio.com is the URL for my show.
3891971	3894453	Why do we have you on the show tonight?
3894473	3897435	Is there some type of ulterior motive that we have you on the program tonight?
3897475	3897676	Yes.
3897696	3898737	Go for it, Bobby.
3915242	3929565	Okay, well, essentially what we've done, I've been talking with Rob and, you know, to DarkSakura and Loki over there, and we have extended an official invitation to re-air this program you're listening on our stream on Monday nights.
3931066	3935467	So what, essentially what will happen is it's going to air on Monday nights at 7 p.m.
3935527	3936667	Eastern, 7 p.m.
3936707	3943929	Pacific, with Scott Rubin's All Games Interactive is going to run right up to it, and then people will get to listen to both Part A and Part B.
3944875	3945816	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3973234	3973715	Yes, it is.
3973775	3974235	There it is.
3974295	3981882	So if you want to hear Part B before we push on the podcast stream, because sometimes we're lazy and we slack off here at OLR, but all games, they're on it.
3981922	3985605	They've got our Part B. They're going to play it Monday nights, so you can hear that in advance.
3985825	3995614	And more than anything, we're just kind of excited to be a part of this and kind of work together, because independent productions and podcasts and things shouldn't work against each other.
3995634	3996354	They should work together.
3996414	3999117	So we're very happy to be on board, Bobby, and thank you so much for thinking of us.
3999917	4000318	And I want to...
4001338	4008040	I was at G4 volunteering when Tech TV occurred.
4008060	4010801	We're not changing anything about OLR.
4010861	4012742	We don't want to take over your station.
4012822	4015483	We don't want to change any content or anything.
4015863	4018904	We're just re-airing the same show trying to expand it to a new audience.
4019175	4019976	That's what I love.
4020437	4025923	And honestly, what makes me so honored is because they're coming and saying, we like what you do as is.
4026164	4028767	And I'm like, wow, somebody likes us.
4029388	4029868	No, it's great.
4029888	4030910	That gives me the warm fuzzies.
4030990	4031711	I know, it's nice.
4031891	4033673	So thank you for giving us the warm fuzzies.
4033813	4034194	We love it.
4035756	4038159	Any other exciting programming coming as well to all games?
4038962	4055579	Well, one of the things that we're doing, we're going to be all at GDC in San Jose, and we are actually going to be broadcasting on All Games Radio on the Thursday night of GDC the Game Audio Network Guild Awards, which is going to be a two-hour award show with live music, live performances, and
4056520	4060023	Giving awards for music of the year, audio of the year, and all that.
4060043	4062745	We're going to be backstage there doing some interviews then.
4063226	4069091	And then Friday night for my show, I'm going to be backstage at Video Games Live asking why Pong.
4069832	4072835	And we'll be airing those on my show that weekend.
4073632	4075353	That's going to be so awesome.
4075413	4078315	I can't believe we're like a part of this in a roundabout way.
4078335	4080157	We're a part of the same station, so that's awesome.
4080457	4081918	I'm going to be listening to that.
4081938	4082639	It's going to be awesome.
4083900	4086301	What else is in store in the future of AllGames.com?
4086341	4091685	Maybe not necessarily just programming, but what's in store for the website, the whole vision of AllGames?
4092926	4094988	Well, we're going to be adding some other podcasts.
4095008	4096709	We've approached other independent podcasters.
4096749	4097690	Y'all are just the first.
4098951	4101973	Going to be putting a lot more podcasts on.
4102386	4104868	Just so people can find new podcasts.
4105909	4109212	Scott Rubin does a lot of television production.
4109372	4113796	We've got a short film done by a man named Michael Hyland called As Real As Your Life.
4113896	4117720	It was premiered at the TED conference during David Perry's.
4117780	4119481	It's going to be screened at GDC, I believe.
4120182	4121343	It's about video game addiction.
4121363	4122924	We're going to take that to film festivals.
4123925	4128790	There's some television programs, too, that we're pitching that we can't talk more about yet.
4129346	4131068	Awesome.
4131088	4133311	I have to give you the pitch for OLR TV later.
4133731	4134472	Okay.
4134793	4135033	All right.
4136314	4138817	Anyway, no, seriously, though, thank you so much, Bobby.
4138897	4141140	And please pass along our thanks to Scott as well.
4141180	4147287	We're really excited to be on board and just kind of get our show out there and be a part of this growing network.
4147327	4147768	It's awesome.
4148489	4148589	Yep.
4149221	4156026	And if anybody listening live, I'm in your chat room, and if they want to ask questions and calm fears or something, they can feel free to see me in there.
4157047	4159208	On this end, guys, nothing's changing.
4159228	4161810	Well, there are other changes coming to OLR, but it has nothing to do with this.
4161850	4163832	It's all us that we're changing.
4164172	4165353	And I guess I'll just go ahead and say it.
4165593	4172178	We're going to be making our station – we're going to be putting a little more oomph in our station because we ran a poll on Orange Lounge Radio, and we found –
4172538	4175559	DarkSakura, Loki, and maybe someday Spike can work with you too, come on your show.
4200796	4202504	Thank you guys for accepting.
4202564	4203308	Not a problem.
4203328	4204031	You take care, Bobby.
4204654	4204935	You too.
4205417	4205699	Bye-bye.
4206792	4211634	Bobby Blackwolf, that website again, www.allgames.com slash podcast.
4211954	4216296	If you want to hear Bobby's show, allgames.com, Orange Lounge Radio starts on Monday.
4216336	4221399	And some of you guys might actually be hearing this show on allgames.com for the first time tomorrow.
4222139	4224400	But it was actually yesterday when we taped, forget it.
4224740	4232664	All right, Loki, take us out of this hour or hour and a half that we're turning into with a little story here about DDR and email and what the heck?
4234878	4238601	Yes, yet another stupid idea brought to you by Microsoft.
4238941	4244766	Now, this one's actually called StepMail, and that's right, it uses a DDR pad to check your email.
4245206	4259897	And it's actually part of this new interface called StepUI, and basically their whole spin on this is, you know what, you're not exercising enough while you're browsing on your PC, and this is a better way to do that.
4261195	4263177	Honestly, folks, how long does it take to check email?
4263217	4263998	Like, two minutes?
4264438	4271945	Do we really need to be walking around on a giant pad that really is obtrusive and just... No.
4272646	4274047	I think this is the dumbest idea ever.
4274748	4280853	It's like, that's almost as dumb as, like, saying, okay, I'm going to control my car with this dance pad as well.
4281594	4286919	Are we sure that something's just not being horribly, horribly misinterpreted or misreported here?
4288069	4290471	This is straight on Microsoft's website, okay?
4290711	4294654	I just want you to know that this isn't like some sort of thing that they're making up.
4294954	4301338	This shows picture of some woman stepping on a dance pad, which, by the way, looks like a red octane pad.
4301899	4305281	And, yes, and it shows the interface right here.
4305879	4310080	You know, up, down, close, open, folders, delete.
4310241	4312941	I like how you have to jump to do different things.
4314162	4314922	It looks so dumb.
4315662	4317283	It's completely retarded.
4317503	4324125	And then they've got a photo viewing thing, which looks like someone crapped it out in about two seconds.
4324165	4328547	You know what would be sweet is if the announcer from DDR Extreme would read your email.
4328567	4329447	You've got mail!
4329867	4330668	You've got mail!
4330748	4331608	It's your new record!
4332148	4333609	Whatever that guy says, you know?
4333629	4334189	You know what?
4334809	4337371	Come get Viagra at our store for free!
4337752	4344998	What they need to do is have a program that hooks up to your email and a little pedal that you put on the ground so that you're sitting down and you're doing like a recumbent bike.
4345518	4348320	And the moment you stop pedaling, your email closes.
4348360	4349601	Don't they have these net bikes?
4349621	4350862	They do at the gym!
4350882	4353044	They should have something like that at home.
4353064	4360330	The study shows, using this program, the average heart rate is increased almost 20% while using StepMail and 13% for StepPhoto.
4362919	4365261	Really though, why would you be looking at photos?
4365601	4367242	I mean, can you imagine?
4368183	4369684	I want to look through my picture album.
4369884	4371605	Let me set up this giant dance pad.
4371966	4375108	And then someone walks in the room, what the hell are you doing, you complete retard?
4375888	4377970	I'm checking my photos in email!
4378510	4379991	Yes, and you're lame.
4380392	4381633	Here it is, here it is, here it is.
4382913	4383514	Imagine this.
4384174	4385095	You're going to have a party.
4385115	4386296	You're going to have an adult party.
4387057	4394323	And so you could get X-rated pictures to look at on this thing and play Naked Twister on the DDR mat.
4394663	4395244	What do you think?
4395664	4396405	I think that's retarded.
4396585	4399047	I think that's the only reason this thing's going to get used, ever.
4399087	4400328	This thing will never get used.
4400848	4404391	It will be some stupid study that Microsoft wastes their money on.
4405152	4408595	Then later on next year, come tax time, they'll be like, you know what?
4408835	4409756	We lost money on this.
4409996	4411037	Tax write-off!
4411277	4412218	That's right.
4412418	4413959	All this is is a tax write-off.
4414540	4417262	What applications do you think this will have on the origami?
4419403	4423005	Well, I can tell you this much, that the dance pad is almost the size of the origami.
4425167	4427848	And on that note, we're going to go ahead and take a break here.
4427988	4431371	We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio in a little bit.
4431911	4436874	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.
4437294	4441597	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
