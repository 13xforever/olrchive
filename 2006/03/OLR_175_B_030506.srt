16
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,040
back into some gaming news here when we left off in the first half we were

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,680
talking about some parenting stories there it's about left behind which the

18
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,240
chat room just ran away with and they're just you know everything left but got

19
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,880
left behind part a their World of Warcraft news and now a piece of news

20
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,080
It's kind of near and dear to us here at orange lounge radio because I think we've all been to this place

21
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,420
This so I haven't you've never been to the Metreon. Oh, really never Wow my very first DDR tournament

22
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,520
I ever went to is at the Metreon. Well, that's what our story is about

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,400
Sony has sold the Metreon the Metreon has been known as like the Sony theme park in a bit of way the

24
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,060
official Sony PlayStation stores there

25
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,820
They have some other things there as well.

26
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,820
Do you remember this dark soccer?

27
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,980
Do you remember the Yumpop store?

28
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,340
I think it was the Yumpop store with the oopsie oops I went to hell shirts and all that stuff.

29
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,340
A store was badass, but then it went away years and years ago.

30
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,660
I guess that should have been the first sign the place was going downhill.

31
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,980
It's like a skyscraper type building.

32
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,140
They have an IMAX theater in the roof.

33
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,220
I saw an IMAX movie there a long time ago.

34
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,220
It's awesome.

35
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,460
They also have the Walk of Game.

36
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:16,180
It was kind of like their answer to Hollywood's Walk of Fame.

37
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,660
They have the Walk of Game.

38
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,860
Well, unfortunately, Sony is selling the Metreon complex,

39
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,300
and who do they sell it to?

40
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,500
Mall developer, the Westfield Group,

41
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,780
and the Four City Enterprises real estate

42
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,820
company for an undisclosed amount of money.

43
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,580
So Sony will continue to operate the official PlayStation

44
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,740
store in the mall.

45
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,340
But as for the rest of the stuff there,

46
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,860
who knows what we could see going up in there pretty soon.

47
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,060
Maybe Abercrombie and Fitch, for all we know.

48
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,900
That would just be peachy, wouldn't it?

49
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,820
Boo-hiss.

50
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:50,000
no idea what's going to happen in the walking game just yet

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,820
yeah but many of us DDR fans like NorCal especially with like fond memories

52
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,720
of Medtron except for Loki who somehow missed it all

53
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,260
it's kinda it's kinda sad

54
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,500
kinda makes me a little bit clipped

55
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,080
talk amongst yourselves

56
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,320
alright the life goes on

57
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,320
so uh... moving on to another story Loki

58
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,600
yes you got some interesting uh... you you had some real great exclusives in the

59
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,120
first

60
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,260
part there about PlayStation 3 and Revolution what do you got now

61
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:25,540
Well, this is kind of, you can file in a rumor of how Sony plans on combating the revolution,

62
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:30,220
and the way they're going to do that, well, of course, it's going to be with the PlayStation

63
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,080
2 and the iToy.

64
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,900
What they're planning on doing is because the PlayStation 2 is already an established

65
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,300
console system out there with, you know, they're still producing them and they're anticipating

66
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:47,940
the price point is going to drop down to $99 in 2007. And of course with the iToy, they're

67
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:55,180
anticipating that you'll be able to use this to create some really revolutionary games.

68
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:00,500
Only problem with that is the iToy doesn't work that good. I know this from first hand

69
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:08,500
experience. And let me put it this way. Wiping windows down and looking like a jackass while

70
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,080
dancing on screen, not revolutionary.

71
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:19,080
Itoy Kinetic was fun for a day, waste of $50 because my apartment does not light good enough.

72
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,200
I mean, it just does not work for Itoy.

73
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,900
And while I could go to Ikea and buy a lamp, I'm not changing the house around to make

74
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,900
the Itoy work.

75
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:34,600
And granted, you know, when they're showing off the Itoy games and they're against a nice

76
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:41,180
white backdrop. That's the perfect environment for the I2Wipe. But most of us people, you

77
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,720
know, we live in rooms with more than white in the room.

78
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,920
Posters and drains.

79
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:53,740
Exactly. Not good. But some of the other stuff that they're talking about, and this is actually

80
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,320
kind of another thing that Xbox is doing too with their camera, is they're gonna be using

81
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,080
multiple cameras to track movement. That's more something on the Xbox 360 front. They're

82
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,160
using that in fact they also showed how they can render your face in there by

83
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,480
doing a screen cap of your face you know facing forward and sideways and then

84
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,680
render it 3d and they're also gonna be using that kind of as an eye toy or

85
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,580
revolution thing as well live with this way it's not gonna be like the

86
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:25,540
revolution no that's why it wouldn't be that revolutionary if it were just that

87
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,880
simple this is all rumor this is not good enough to combat the revolution

88
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,480
thing you know there's probably there's other things that are going to set the

89
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,440
ps3 apart from the revolution as just as there's going to be things to set Xbox

90
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,440
360 apart from it there's no need for these guys to all try and copy the only

91
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,920
good thing about the PlayStation 2 is it's not going to be as expensive as

92
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:51,880
PlayStation 3 comments from our chat room www.orange lounge radio.com we love

93
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,760
the interactivity that a taping live on Sunday nights brings us here gs 191 says

94
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:02,880
Itoy good concept terrible games. What makes you think that the ps3 x360 camera is going to be better

95
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,840
Good point going back to the metreon story there earlier

96
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,260
Somebody had said I'm trying to find the thing here

97
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,840
somebody had said that

98
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,800
Old tech TV shows had been taped at the metreon so it kind of further Oh Tomo Coon said dude

99
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,400
It had tech TV shows taped there just to further add insult to injury to the whole you know tech TV is

100
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,420
long gone type thing. X-Play used to be recorded, or before X-Play, what the hell was it called?

101
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:39,420
Extended Play. Extended Play was recorded there. Sad. And now it's going to be just

102
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:44,420
a giant Abercrombie and Fitch, just wait. Banana Republic going in there as well.

103
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:51,340
Alright, moving in, I made all that up by the way. Moving on, EA we talked about in

104
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:57,980
first half a little bit there the VP over at EA doctor I'm gonna say this so

105
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:04,100
horrible Jens Uwe Entat foresees that there will be a shift coming within the

106
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:09,940
next 10 years quote CDs DVDs and box games will be as antiquated as cassette

107
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:15,500
tapes and vinyl records what are they going in favor of their double boo

108
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,460
downloadable media this that they're saying that the downloadable media is

109
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:24,500
going to be the shift there in 10 years there and of course you look at the

110
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,980
success of iTunes and you think it's just a matter of time before movies

111
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,980
start being distributed the same way heck it's already happening on iTunes

112
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:35,900
some shows that maybe aren't even doing that successful on TV well I don't know

113
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,460
like I'm thinking of The Office does really really well on iTunes and it does

114
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,340
okay on TV but it does really well on iTunes so kind of you know it might be

115
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:48,820
the future outlet for TV and of course independent vidcast and getting bigger

116
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,820
bigger and bigger.

117
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,860
Well now, why not the same model apply to games?

118
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:58,180
Well, they're also probably going to start streaming the Direct TV tab that's going

119
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:04,140
to be coming to the Xbox Live, your desktop there.

120
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:10,260
They're also going to be having location free players for the PlayStation 3.

121
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,480
Also you've got the news that PlayStation 3 in Korea is going to start doing direct

122
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,640
downloads of games straight to your hard drive because they want to combat piracy there and

123
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,640
and they're going to offer them at less than retail.

124
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:26,880
So, hmm, and hell, we're doing it right now with the Xbox Live Arcade, just in a smaller

125
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,880
format.

126
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,600
You know, I went to a panel at Katsucon and I asked a question about this, and I practically

127
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:37,920
got laughed at when people were saying Xbox Live Arcade does not pose a threat to the

128
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:43,840
regular system of downloading games, and I'm thinking, okay, now I've got this EA vice

129
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,400
president backing me up, which I need to point out, he's actually Electronic Arts Europe

130
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,600
vice president so sorry clarifying that earlier

131
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,160
that this downloadable games thing is going to be more and more of

132
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:00,280
force I think so we'll see now one thing he does say that you know

133
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,800
is is a bit of a interesting point here on Apple has kept their song prices at

134
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,400
ninety nine cents per song

135
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,360
and this is a low figure that kinda makes people in the music business a

136
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:09,960
little bit

137
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,400
angry here. iTunes essentially has a monopoly

138
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:18,420
Dr. Entant seems to think that with so many consoles available, there's not going to be

139
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:23,180
a monopoly possible if this model works with games.

140
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,180
It's not going to happen.

141
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,200
I can tell you this much, and here's why it's not going to happen, because you have all

142
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,600
the major retailers that make a lot of money off of these games.

143
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,080
Also you've got rental chains.

144
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,480
If we all start streaming media, what's going to happen to the whole rental market?

145
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,680
It's gone.

146
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:46,480
You've got GameStop and freaking EB there, well, same company now, but their whole business

147
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,440
is game purchasing and stuff.

148
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,680
It's not going to happen because if that happens, they're going to lose money from all these

149
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,920
different outlets and then...

150
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,080
Well, what about moving with the seas of change though?

151
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,440
Tower Records doesn't still primarily make their business off records in the sense that

152
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,640
we know them.

153
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:10,380
Blockbuster realizes that people like the Netflix model so they copy it you know and do their own thing

154
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:15,240
What's to say that GameStop isn't one of the online services that decides to get it on there?

155
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,760
I mean who knows this is obviously all huge amounts of speculation, but you know

156
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,080
It's it's a good question to ask where will gaming be in ten years. It's an excellent idea

157
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,600
Unfortunately those 28 hard drives that they were packaging with the Xbox 360 not gonna work okay, but in ten years

158
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,240
years we're not gonna be talking Xbox 360 we're gonna be talking Xbox 1080 or

159
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:41,800
something I don't know all right whatever way forget it all right moving

160
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:47,480
on we got another story here several stories actually from dark Sakura since

161
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,320
we had a little comment there from the Electronic Arts vice president over in

162
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,600
Europe why not give our pals over in Europe a little more information on

163
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,400
what's going on in their neck of the word woods and Jamie you keep tabs on

164
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,800
that? What's going on? We thought they were gone. We thought we heard the last of them.

165
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:12,040
Acclaim is back. Really? Yes, with a free MMO, actually. Oh. It's called Bot. It looks

166
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,760
like it's all capitalized. I'm already bored. It's basically, they're describing

167
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:22,840
it as a title that will appeal to everyone. Basically, you start off with

168
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:28,600
adaptable upgradable little robots are supposedly really cute and there's a

169
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:35,160
I can do cute story about some evil virus PvP capture the flag that kind of

170
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:40,600
stuff but you are supposed to have these near infinite combinations of upgrades

171
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:46,920
you know there was a game like this back in the days of the Sega CD called what

172
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:54,680
was at robo pit which I have and I paid a five cents for I kid you not I know I

173
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,200
think that I paid 50 cents for it at an EB brand new it also reminds me of the

174
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:08,520
enix SNES game robo track yeah but at any rate this they're working on this

175
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:14,200
there's actually a new a claim games website where they have there the beta

176
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,760
test is up there to register for there's also a future title coming out called

177
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,280
it's a martial arts MMO called nine dragons but if you just go to a claim

178
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:29,360
calm it's the first link on there the first little image there I think I'll

179
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,820
sign up for it it looks really cute I'm I'm I'm interested if it's cute I could

180
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:38,240
do that well also I like that I like that you know nine dragons sounds like

181
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,760
it has a hard edge to it well the actual site for bots is www.botsgame.com

182
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:50,480
B-O-T-S-G-A-M-E, and there's actually, it actually looks pretty neat.

183
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,960
This is funny, we got a comment in our chat room here, Ranma says, I saw the site for

184
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,360
Acclaim's bots, it looks just like the Ragnarok Online page.

185
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,360
It does!

186
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,520
It's laid out just like a website for a Korean MMO.

187
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,640
I love Ragnarok Online, so I think I'll give the bots a try.

188
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,640
Alright.

189
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,200
Ragnarok Online certainly was cute, and it was the only game that would allow my male,

190
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,440
the only game I've ever played that would allow my male character to wear a bow in his

191
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,800
said. I was hardcore. I still have that photo. It was my camera wallpaper. I was on my cell

192
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,880
phone for forever. Anyway, moving on. And my character is like this badass assassin

193
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:30,880
looking girl. It was cool. I miss Ragnarok. Um, anyway, uh, next up, uh, a comment by,

194
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,920
uh, uh, Roger Bennett, who is the general director of a UK video games publisher, Trade

195
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:43,620
E L S P A said there's complete and utter nonsense about a speech made in

196
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:49,820
Parliament by the Labour MP Keith Vasque stating about new laws or relating to

197
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:58,780
video game ratings. I brought this up earlier. Basically, GamesIndustry.biz

198
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:04,100
was told and I quote, his whole thrust with this proposed bill was about

199
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,900
labeling which he got utterly and completely wrong and that it hasn't got up to speed

200
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,520
with what has happened over the last three or four years.

201
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:15,180
Vaz was proposing an amendment to the Video Recordings Act in 1984 that would make it

202
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:20,680
mandatory for video games to receive content ratings the same way that films do.

203
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:27,500
It's a voluntary, the PEGI rating system is all voluntary to coincide with that.

204
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:34,780
but he was arguing in Parliament that the current system where basically it

205
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:41,780
sees the PEGI ratings being complemented by the what's it called the

206
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,540
British Board of Film classification to go along the same lines but they're

207
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:53,340
saying that's very confusing. Let me get the next quote on here because it's a

208
00:14:53,340 --> 00:15:00,900
very very long article that I've been digesting over this. But basically, it was going back,

209
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,060
Bennett stated, the fact of the matter is that we're one of only two countries in the

210
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:08,580
whole 27 states in the European Union who have mandatory ratings. Everywhere else in

211
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:12,620
Europe these ratings are on the boxes, the PEGI ratings, and they make informed decisions

212
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,080
for their kids. You know, parents are doing that. The more you take the responsibility

213
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,540
away from the parents, the less responsibility they'll take. As soon as you take responsibility

214
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:24,080
away from the people than they rely on others to do it for them the whole

215
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:28,100
process is mindless in my view at the end of the day as long as the information is

216
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,540
there we should leave it to the parents and guardians those to those responsible

217
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,640
for young people to make informed decisions about what they should or

218
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:39,860
shouldn't watch they blame the blame culture in which we seem to live these

219
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:45,220
days as a result of the promotion that of the nanny state no question about it

220
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:48,780
it's always somebody else's fault and they have to have somebody else to blame

221
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:53,080
That right there is my argument.

222
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,700
This guy is my hero now.

223
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:00,160
Let's bring down the old OLR hero wall.

224
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:06,440
I'm going to print out his photo at Kinko's and put it on the wall because I don't think

225
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:12,280
it's ever been stated better than I've seen it in print there.

226
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:19,840
And I really do think that's what it comes down to is that we have these figures in government

227
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:26,440
trying to basically dictate, and it's not just here, this is proof, it is everywhere,

228
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:31,920
trying to dictate what the people see, what the people watch, take responsibility away

229
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,200
from the people, take away accountability from the people and put it in the hands of

230
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,880
government to babysit them.

231
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,520
you know what it's been happening more especially and I hate especially since

232
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,280
9-11 it's been happening more and more where we've had our governments taking

233
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:50,440
control over what they view as protection action whether it's in

234
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,720
censorship of video games not just that I think more so Alma I mean certainly I

235
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,640
noticed it then too but Janet Jackson booby Super Bowl hello yeah that was a

236
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:05,360
huge you know shift in that what we're seeing is you know especially in and I

237
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,780
think that's actually even more of a slap in the face to those of us in the

238
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:12,560
United States where we're founded on these principles of free speech and

239
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:18,660
human rights where we really don't have that liberal environment that we were

240
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:23,000
founded under honestly you know the true there was a lot of concern a lot more

241
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,580
what we would see as conservatism you know back then but you know you have to

242
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:32,180
think about it we are a very repressed society and our government is just you

243
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:37,260
know sort of pushing that along SSJ 100 Matt in our chat room just called OLR

244
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:45,980
the no spin zone at any rate at any rate all right I think though that the whole

245
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:52,900
especially with you know Jackie poo his whole agenda with you know seeing this

246
00:17:52,900 --> 00:18:02,340
come up I think it really is more of and more of a view overall that they're not

247
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:06,140
wanting us to be accountable for ourselves they take the power away from

248
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:11,380
the people and we're left just blindly following what they tell us to that's

249
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:15,620
what that's my theory behind all of this I think that it all goes hand in hand

250
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:19,420
send those cards and letters to mailbag at orange launch radio.com and that's

251
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:24,220
just my opinion all right that's just my observation but again you know I find it

252
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:29,420
very sad that governments are having to step in and tell parents how to do their

253
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:35,740
jobs you know trying to dictate what you can and can do one more all right bit of

254
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:44,140
European news is the PSP giga pack price has been slashed basically for any

255
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:51,500
Northern Irish gamers hoping to pick up the PSP Gigapack, GameStop has slashed

00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:59,900
I've been bad at watching 24. I didn't watch any TV at all while I was on my little business trip.

274
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,380
I was actually in Virginia. I don't think I ever said where I was. I was in Virginia.

275
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:07,180
I didn't really watch any TV, I was in Virginia Beach in the middle of winter which is a great

276
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,100
time to go, yeah.

277
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:14,580
But I didn't watch any TV, except for The Apprentice, I watched The Apprentice once and

278
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,140
it wasn't even that good.

284
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:54,420
Wonder Dog Harold would just like you all to know that watching 24 caused him to have

285
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:58,100
a dream of naked Jean Smart from Designing Women who plays...

286
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:03,020
god she's on this new season so oh my god she still has a career yes she's

287
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:06,580
she actually has a great room she was the blonde one I only saw wasn't she

288
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:10,460
yeah I only saw for the first four episodes or the first two long episodes

289
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,700
the first four hours and she had a pretty badass role I gotta say so you

290
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:18,260
know her career is jump-starting anyway but she's not in the game anyway we'd

291
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:22,780
love to follow up UK release dates that was it right yeah we'd love to follow I

292
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:26,100

00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,460
but I've just been pent up for two weeks in Virginia.

Other notable stuff coming out later on in the month here, we of course have Driver Parallel

313
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:52,580
Lions coming out the week of the 13th, as well as Metal Gear Solid 3 Subsistence, which

314
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:57,620
should be really sweet, at the outfit for Xbox 360.

315
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:01,920
And then finally the week of the 20th, we've got a couple games coming out, most notably

316
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:09,960
The Godfather is hitting Xbox and Playstation 2, as well as Blazing Angels is coming out

317
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,320
on xbox and xbox 360 and of course

318
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,880
the ever anticipated Elder Scrolls IV finally hitting the Xbox 360

319
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,680
finally and me and my katamari I gotta put that in there and Metroid Prime Hunters

320
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,280
because those are really good games as well. Tetris DS also that week

321
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,640
and also Metal Gear Acid 2 and Mega Man Power Piv

322
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,680
Oh my bank account is gonna cry the end of this month

323
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:35,640
it's gonna be a sad week at my bank. And Worms Open Warfare and I'm actually looking

324
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,320
forward to that game

325
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,560
All right, just so you know, Wonder Dog Harold would also like to remind you in regards to

326
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:46,200
our previous conversation, Jean Smart was also the voice of Mrs. Possible in Kim Possible,

327
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,760
just for those of you following her career.

328
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,560
And Beatmania on the 29th.

329
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,600
Thank you.

330
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,280
Which does not feature Jean Smart.

331
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,280
No.

332
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,280
Maybe Beatmania 2.

333
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,320
But it's also launched the same day as Kariok Revolution Country.

334
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,200
These games that we love, Beatmania and all that stuff, and you know we love US games

335
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,240
too, don't get us wrong, we love games from all around, but Japan certainly brings us

336
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,520
lots and lots and lots of memorable great games there's a magazine over

337
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,560
there that has a lot of clout over in the Japan gaming market it's called

338
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:18,480
Famitsu well they recently polled their readers to vote on their all-time

339
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,240
favorite 100 games where there's a magazine there's another list that's

340
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:28,240
right and what's interesting about this list well let me just let the list speak

341
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,680
for itself here's the top 10 you ready number 10 Legend of Zelda Ocarina of

342
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:40,600
time number 9 Dragon Quest 7 number 8 Final Fantasy 3 number 7 tactics ogre

343
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:49,280
number 6 Final Fantasy 4 number 5 Machi number 4 Dragon Quest 8 number 3 Dragon

344
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:54,840
Quest 3 number 2 Final Fantasy 7 and the number one game of all time Final

345
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:00,720
Fantasy 10 as voted by the readers of Famitsu magazine that makes sense

346
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,840
Because Final Fantasy X has this humongous fandom built around it.

347
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,000
Right, and that's not surprising in any way, but let me get that straight.

348
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,760
That's four Final Fantasies and three Dragon Quests comprising the top ten.

349
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,800
Might I also point out Dragon Quest V, number 11.

350
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,480
Dragon Quest IV, number 14.

351
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,080
Dragon Quest II, number 17.

352
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,800
Final Fantasy VIII, number 22.

353
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,480
Final Fantasy IX, 24.

354
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,080
Final Fantasy VI, 25.

355
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:26,800
Shall I continue?

356
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,560
So they like their RPGs.

357
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,680
It's not surprising at all.

358
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,180
It's not. It's really not, but it's-

359
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,780
And I'm actually really not at all surprised to see Tactics Ogre in there.

360
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,080
Where was Final Fantasy Tactics?

361
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,580
Uhh...

362
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:41,080
I don't see it in the top 50, maybe in the bottom 50.

363
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,080
Let me keep looking here.

364
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:46,380
Final Fantasy Tactics I know had a big following for a while, too,

365
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,480
but Tactics Ogre completely does not surprise me.

366
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,780
84 Final Fantasy Tactics.

367
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,780
It's on the list.

368
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,080
But, you know-

369
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,280
Do they have any of the PC Engine titles in there?

370
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,380
Like Dracula X?

371
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,640
Yeah, I don't know if I saw anything

372
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:08,360
Yeah, you know what or a dragon? What about that Animal Crossing is 43. There you go. That's something Metal Gear Solid 50

373
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,720
Let's see. I need to know where Dracula X is on that. I don't think it's there

374
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,240
Gradius 98

375
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:20,880
I'm looking I'm looking at this is uh, they they published this over on next dash gen dot

376
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,280
B IZ by the way is where I'm pulling this from. I don't see a single

377
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:29,280
Castlevania game on here, but I'm eyeing it. I might be missing it, so I apologize if I'm wrong there.

378
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,280
That wounds me in my soul.

379
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,280
So, um, what do you think? I mean, I guess...

380
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:38,280
They're smoking crack, but Famitsu is, like, notorious for being bastards, so...

381
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:44,280
Well, you know, didn't they have to make a law that Dragon Quest games don't come out on school days or something like that?

382
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:51,280
Like, it shouldn't be surprising that Dragon Quest just totally dominates this and Final Fantasy, you know, same deal.

383
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,880
so I actually would have it I would have expected one of the Dragon Quest games

384
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:00,160
take the top spot it's it's pretty big over there but now it's getting now it's

385
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,920
finally like really catching on it hasn't really caught on since Dragon

386
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:09,000
Dragon Warrior now with Dragon Quest 8 so it's kind of interesting I don't know

387
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:17,080
anyway moving on let's go over to Loki for some reports on the homebrew scene

388
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:25,320
of course, as always. Starting off, some wonderful games coming to the PSP homebrew scene. First

389
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:33,440
one is a Halo clone. That's right, they're working on a Halo kind of port to the PSP.

390
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:39,860
It's based on the game or multiplayer app Iris, and it's actually a mod, but it's going

391
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:45,180
to be containing four player deathmatch type of gameplay. So that's kind of being worked

392
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,660
on right now.

393
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:50,260
As far as stuff that's out there right now, I've already mentioned this in the last podcast

394
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,940
but gotta cover it again.

395
00:27:51,940 --> 00:28:00,540
The new Super Nintendo emulator SNES 9X version 0.4 has been updated with wireless multiplayer

396
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:06,020
so you can actually go ahead and play people near you at some Street Fighter and they've

397
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:09,940
actually clocked it at 60 frames per second while playing.

398
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,620
So that's kinda cool.

399
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:16,580
Another homebrew stuff that's going to be coming out though for the PSP, they've created

400
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:22,060
an ISO loader using the exploit in Grand Theft Auto.

401
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:27,620
Another thing that they've also been able to do is launch Grand Theft Auto on version

402
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,220
1.5 firmware.

403
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:32,900
And for those who have played Grand Theft Auto's Liberty City Stories, you'll know that

404
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,180
it forces you to upgrade to 2.0.

405
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:39,860
So they've actually bypassed all that and got to run on that same firmware.

406
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:44,100
The other thing that they've also launched is an upgrade to that because they're worried

407
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:48,020
that people are going to be pirating games and stuff, so they've actually got a UMD loader

408
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:55,460
for firmware 1.5 that will run any game that will force you to update to 2.0 or higher

409
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,900
in 1.5 if you have the UMD.

410
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,560
Because a lot of people do have games out there they want to play but they want to play

411
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,380
their homebrew stuff, now they can.

412
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,640
So that's kind of cool.

413
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:14,120
Other things, there was also, kind of teased a little bit for the DS, basically you can

414
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:18,840
have remote access to your PC using the DS and that was kind of cool, they showed a little

415
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,880
picture of that, but no release on that yet.

416
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:30,440
Alright, keep us posted on what's going on and whatever they install Linux on next and

417
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,440
all that fun stuff.

418
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,440
Yeah, I was waiting for the 360 for Linux.

419
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:41,440
Alright, DarkSockra, you're going to get all the fun stories tonight on like violence and political stuff.

420
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,440
What do you got next?

421
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,440
I'm all about the violence.

422
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,440
I mean the poli...the...the...

423
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,440
The politics, the violence.

424
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,440
I'm all about the violence.

425
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,440
Alright, we know.

426
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,440
Okay, guess what?

427
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,440
With the increase of video game violence,

428
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,440
aha, we have crime going way down.

429
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,440
Isn't that awesome? Wait, crime went down when video game

430
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,440
violence went up? Do tell. Basically with the increase

431
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,440
of the first person shooter genre, crime, uh,

432
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,440
I'm sorry, I was backwards on that one. Oh, that's alright.

433
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:22,440
Well, you know, we already went over that before, but the crime-based action games are

434
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:26,240
declining so what that means but the still that means there's more of a

435
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,960
demand over here than there is over there that says something yep but

436
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:39,760
basically the the I'm tongue-tied excuse me but they were basically saying that

437
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:47,080
even though the success of Grand Theft Auto and all that you know has been so

438
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:51,520
big that they're still not so many of them coming out that the first-person

439
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:58,520
shooter is really taking prevalence in the whole video game industry.

440
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,680
But that, you know, we did have an earlier story that did state, you know, I remember

441
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:05,720
doing something on the show a while ago that despite the violent video games coming out,

442
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,520
people get their aggressions out on them or something because overall, crime rate, you

443
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,520
know...

444
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:15,760
Well, yeah, well, the thing is though is that the study is still there though at the Department

445
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,760
of Justice.

446
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:22,480
You know there are charts proving that since what was it 93 when the PlayStation came out

447
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:27,080
There has been a decrease in in youth-based violence

448
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,280
You know basically the 18 the the age 12 to 18

449
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,620
Area that there has been a decrease in violent acts created by a minor

450
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:43,640
all right all right well no but there's actually though in specifically in

451
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,360
regards to this though first-person shooters are becoming the big deal to be

452
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,060
continued I'm sure well we do know that of course we got a civil war

453
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:55,500
first-person shooter coming out thanks what I'm from Alabama and I hear enough

454
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:01,820
of this crap being from Alabama so all right moving on since we just had a

455
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:05,260
story on violence I figured it was time for us to get violent with a little

456
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:10,060
segment we call the FUs of the week dark soccer are you ready to get angsty

457
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:13,580
when am I not

458
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:34,980
my first well my big only FU is I'm tired of being the emotional receptacle

459
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:45,380
the world you know I can take and take and take and take and I don't know if

460
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:52,820
I'm just easily been ventable to but I have to it's not really an F you it's

461
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:59,660
more of an F you toward myself just because I can't I have to get my

462
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:03,820
aggression out to you damn it I don't see why everybody let it all out girl

463
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:09,460
I don't see why everybody in the universe feels that they can just tell me their whole life story

464
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,340
like it's some horrible thing and

465
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,500
It's going to really you know

466
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:22,260
Like some complete stranger starts telling me about how bad their life sucks, and I'm like okay

467
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:28,980
Why are you telling me this did you tell them to stop? I just sort of said I have to go now

468
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:35,540
now. But it's like, it's been happening more often than not lately that I've been getting

469
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:41,500
ransomed, you know, in, in, in defensive people, you know, I never really mind hearing it.

470
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:46,380
You know, if you need to vent to me, say hey, I think you're a good person to talk to, let's

471
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:51,660
talk about it. But when it comes out, you know, completely unprovoked, I'm like, okay,

472
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:56,500
what did that have to do with anything? This is so out of left field. And especially without,

473
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:02,460
know even saying hey is this a good time for you emotionally for me to vent to

474
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:06,640
you need to make sure that when you're going to talk to somebody that they're

475
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:11,340
gonna be in a position to listen to you objectively and not just because you

476
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:16,160
know say that the person you're talking to you is really depressed really

477
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:21,720
stressed out really just having an awful day and then you start talking about how

478
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,820
much your life sucks how's that gonna make them feel

479
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:28,820
they're either gonna go excuse me your life sucks here's mine or it's gonna

480
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:35,260
make them feel worse than they're gonna guess what they're at. emo

481
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:41,940
so the moral of the story is get a live journal? Vlog it! you know the

482
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:47,540
moral of this though is if you have a problem and you need to vent to somebody

483
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:51,980
make sure that your intended venting audience is in a position that they're

484
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:54,220
going to be able to withstand your vending.

485
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:57,620
That's www.myspace.com.

486
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,460
That's where the Internet goes to die.

487
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,780
Tom will be your friend when no one else will.

488
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,780
Just so you know.

489
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:08,140
But, but I'm serious, so it's, I never mind listening to my friends when they need me.

490
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:13,340
I am always there, and listeners, I am there for you, okay?

491
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:18,180
But make sure that if you are going to vent to me that I am not having the utter shit

492
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,100
of the day before you do.

493
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,100
Thank you.

494
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:29,740
Um, really the only thing I'm kind of frustrated at is Xbox Live's arcade, or not really their

495
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:32,380
arcade, their online play for full auto.

496
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:36,320
The people playing full auto keep jumping out of the games like they're playing Mario

497
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,420
Kart DS or something.

498
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,860
And granted, you know, I'm not too worried about, I mean, cause I understand people will

499
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:45,940
do that, and you know, I don't think that it's a huge deal, but the fact is, you know,

500
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,860
I'm playing the game, I'm not even doing that well, I'm getting like sixth place, and I'm

501
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:54,140
still taking the spot and I'm willing to take the 6th place and not get that many points.

502
00:35:54,140 --> 00:36:00,140
But it doesn't even count because everyone drops out of the game. And so, I waste time

503
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:04,220
playing through these races for nothing. And also, god damn it, I'm doing so good in those

504
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:08,580
races and I hit a damn, like, something will fly out on the street like a little apple

505
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:12,820
or something and my car will flip into the air like 50 feet because the physics are all

506
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:17,340
fucked up. It's really frustrating, but god damn it at least I beat those stupid gang

507
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:24,100
war missions because I wanted to break something that's it all right I you know

508
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:28,540
I was actually in a really like just crappy mood all day because I like like

509
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:31,860
PMS for men or something is what I've been going through today but actually

510
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:36,140
the show has put me in a much better mood so I thank you guys for having a

511
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:39,860
happy super duper show tonight because I'm actually in a better mood and I feel

512
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,860
like throughout my randomness and my rants I've been able to get it out so I

513
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:48,660
I guess my only FU that is left is FU to the Oscars for daring to compete with our program tonight.

514
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:53,660
You're going down, Stuart. Mr. John Stuart, you're going down, buddy.

515
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,760
Orange Lounge, aren't you?

516
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,760
Spike, you have any angst you need to get out?

517
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,560
I mean, with a name like Spike, you gotta be an angry person, right?

518
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:06,860
Well, actually I have two things, and they're both directed towards Capcom.

519
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:11,660
The first one is that as cool as I think it is that you can play as the robot masters

520
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:17,180
in Mega Man powered up, these new character designs have to go.

521
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:21,460
Because Mega Man is not meant to be one of those Duplo block characters.

522
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:25,860
And the fact that he is, baby Jesus Christ for him.

523
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:31,620
Second, Capcom is putting out a collection of their classic arcade games.

524
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:35,540
It's a follow-up to their arcade classics line recently launched.

525
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,140
the remix pack

526
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,820
and for some reason in their infinite wisdom they

527
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:43,820
seep it to take up valuable space on that UMD with

528
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:48,100
Quiz and Dragons

529
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:52,180
Quiz and Dragons is badass, you shut up, I love that game

530
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:57,020
I used to, I used to, do you know how many quarters I wasted at the local P3 playing Quiz and Dragons

531
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:01,380
and I screamed like a little girl when I found that game in MAME like years ago

532
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,100
so sit down

533
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:09,020
are you serious i am fucking serious the hell is quiz and dragon it was quiz it was

534
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:15,100
a quiz show choose quiz or dragon i choose quiz can't go dad it was a quiz thing it was

535
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:26,100
a quiz thing with dragon i'll have the vegetarian all right all right people all right well

536
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:29,220
it just just for the record i want to stay even though spike got a little angsty there

537
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:33,220
You know, Spike is actually just one of the most cuddly guys I know. He's a nice boy.

538
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:35,720
So.

539
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,720
Uh, moving on.

540
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,220
Quiz and Dragons.

541
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:44,220
He just has some strong opinions about very good games that Capcom put out that were horribly underrated.

542
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:47,220
Like Black Tiger. Absolutely.

543
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,720
I love Black Tiger, but Quiz and Dragons...

544
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,220
Loki, speaking of, uh...

545
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,220
Dragon-type things.

546
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,220
Okay, actually, this game has nothing to do with dragons.

547
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:00,580
I don't know what the hell that was just just just take over. Well, that wasn't

548
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:04,740
You we have to stand back for a second. That was the most awesome

549
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:10,060
Transition ever. Anyways, I told you I told you I'm gonna off night tonight

550
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:13,760
I have like two and a half weeks to forget it. Just just go

551
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:17,700
Speaking of quizzes and dragons Soul Caliber the movie

552
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:22,120
Is actually being worked on right now and because you know what?

553
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:26,000
apparently some movie studio out there is like you know what we have money to

554
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:32,860
burn let's burn some money and yeah they anyways they launched their website for

555
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:37,800
this and it teases at the movie doesn't show anything it was like a Nostradamus

556
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:43,980
quote or something yeah what is this www.soulcaliburthemovie.com or

557
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:51,980
soulcaliburthemovie.com and it loads up this wonderful strive to understand what

558
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,980
But I have found through my just...

559
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,580
Sorry, you're not Mr. Movie Phone.

560
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,200
Just stop.

561
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,220
Anyway, so yeah, it puts up stupid little text on there.

562
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,980
And not a single picture of Ivy.

563
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:05,460
And this sword shall smite the earth.

564
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:08,940
Okay, yeah, look, I thought it was bullshit

565
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:09,780
when I first looked at it.

566
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,740
It's a fan thing, bullshit.

567
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,920
But I was like, okay, maybe there's something going on here.

568
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,280
So I put on my Google hat and I went over to Google

569
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,700
and I started searching all around

570
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:25,400
And sure enough, I found this page on Backstage.com and it shows films that are currently in development

571
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,920
in the early development process.

572
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:30,000
And sure enough, there it is, Soul Calibur the movie action.

573
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,220
Look at this, Romania, China, and Canada, I guess that's where they're going to be filming

574
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,220
this.

575
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:38,080
And Second Degree Media are the folks behind this.

576
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:41,120
And I could give phone numbers and stuff, but I'm not going to do that.

577
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:47,820
But the executive producer behind that, Vijay P. Agarwal, you know what, I'm going to put

578
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,120
him in the internet movie database right now you know I've always said how

579
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:56,820
Canada almost resembles Romania and China well it's look it's just like you

580
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:59,940
know the Oscars around tonight the big movie tonight Brokeback Mountain you

581
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:04,020
know if it weren't for all the French people and snow you know we hold on but

582
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,940
they seem Brokeback Mountain is driving all this tourism to Wyoming it was

583
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:14,740
filmed in Canada which is you know amazing anyway let's see I'm still

584
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,940
trying to find this guy's figure out what else he was affiliated with the

585
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:24,700
executive producer there let's see such wonderful films as I don't know if this

586
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:29,020
is the same one here that can't be the same one I know more to come more to

587
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:32,420
come I'll do research and get back to you guys he hasn't made Jack for now for

588
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:35,500
now let's go back to a story about Electronic Arts of course they make a

589
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:39,680
lot of their money off those NFL games right the NFL and the Players

590
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,780
Association are currently involved in a debate over salaries and players cuts

591
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:48,720
et cetera, et cetera, unless they get to an agreement, they're going to maybe go on strike

592
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:55,540
and maybe there'll be a lockout in 2008, who knows.

593
00:41:55,540 --> 00:42:00,560
If there's some antitrust that goes in here, if the antitrust rules go into play with this

594
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:06,820
whole strike or whatever, it would void Electronics Arts' contract with the NFL, and that would

595
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:09,760
really suck for EA if that happened.

596
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,760
Who burned?

597
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,760
Poor babies.

598
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,000
So they better hope there's no strike.

599
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
don't deserve that

600
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,280
we'll see. I know a lot of you guys that listen to this program

601
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,000
probably don't play those games but for those that do there you go

602
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,720
Loki what else you got? My husband does. Anyways

603
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,120
a couple weeks ago there was this wonderful little arcade show in Japan

604
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:32,080
where they showed off some really cool stuff yes that's right

605
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:36,000
AOU 2006 they had a couple

606
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,800
wonderful highlights here we're gonna cover. First one being Time Crisis 4

607
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,980
because you know time crisis rocks and

608
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:48,800
Soul caliber 3 is finally making its way to the arcade as well some other games that taiko no tatujin

609
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:53,480
Coming out now with Super Mario Brothers songs, so that should be pretty cool

610
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,440
other things

611
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:00,200
of course half-life 2 survivor, which is going to be the

612
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:05,000
Arcade version of half-life 2 kind of with a lot of deathmatch stuff there

613
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:13,880
Let's see here, also some stuff from Sega, Virtual Fighter 5, which looks pretty cool,

614
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:19,640
and House of the Dead 4, which is really neat, better graphics of course, and they even have

615
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:25,480
a version that's kind of one of those arcade ride simulator type things, with a 100 inch

616
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:30,520
screen and it actually, they strap you in, it rotates around, it kind of coincides with

617
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,520
the movie.

618
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:38,260
Let's see, other things, of course, would be Virtual Strikers 4, you know, for your

619
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:45,260
soccer fans, and some new brain training game, hmm, interesting.

620
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,100
So yeah.

621
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:52,740
Something of note for those of you local here to the Sacramento area, the movie theater

622
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:58,500
over in Roseville currently has a test machine of House of the Dead 4. I was there last night,

623
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,500
It was rather impressive.

624
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,500
Oooh, House of the Dead.

625
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,620
Does it still have the awful voice acting?

626
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,620
Yes!

627
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:04,620
Yay!

628
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:08,780
And that Lindbergh board, it's putting out some textures that amazed the hell out of

629
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:09,780
me.

630
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:10,780
Really?

631
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:14,020
Awesome, awesome 3D, and bad voice acting.

632
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:18,460
I need to go spill coke on that machine.

633
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:20,740
Wake me when Typing of the Dead 2 comes out.

634
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,640
Dude, I love Typing of the Dead.

635
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,700
I do too, that's why I'm not, I wanna do a cosplay where I strike a Dreamcast to my

636
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:27,700
back.

637
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:30,980
done that now done it now now makes me happy

638
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:35,140
rob microsoft could be working on that next if this whole you know

639
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:39,220
ddr email thing falls through maybe you know what

640
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:42,340
you know what that whole typing of the dead setup reminds me of

641
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:45,140
the origami

642
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:50,820
tapping of the dead because you know it's got the touch screen

643
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:55,460
speaking of origami sometimes we get pieces of mail and dark sakura reads

644
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:58,260
them and then folds them into little paper cranes.

645
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:02,860
But not some letters that she selected this week to read in our one and only mailbag.

646
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:05,220
Dark Sakura, how can they send us an email?

647
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:09,220
They can write to mailbag at orangesoundradio.com.

648
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:13,500
And we set aside some time in the show for Dark Sakura to read these emails to you and

649
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,340
oh look, it's time.

650
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:18,860
I got a bajillion emails in the last couple of weeks.

651
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:23,980
I've tried to reply to as many as I can and unfortunately I've been sort of pooped on

652
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:28,780
by school so sorry as in I'm sort of skipping class tomorrow to finish my

653
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:33,760
homework but hey back to the mailbag I'm such a responsible student aren't I we

654
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:41,520
got an email from Robert sent us an email who had a question about guitar

655
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:46,200
hero to go ahead and quote this email is there any talk about guitar hero being

656
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:51,440
made for Japan sure red octane is as far as I know an American publisher unlike

657
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:56,240
Like Konami who did the Karaoke Revolution series overseas as well as domestically.

658
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:01,760
And the current song selections are very US and European, but do you see the game competing

659
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,340
well with Guitar Freaks?

660
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:10,600
I think most Bomani fans in general, and I'm making a broad generalization, of course there

661
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,980
are exceptions to this, I think most of the community prefers Guitar Hero over Guitar

662
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:17,480
Freaks because Guitar Hero kind of improved on the Guitar Freaks model.

663
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:21,200
So could the game do well in Japan?

664
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:25,480
I think they'd obviously have to change the song list, but go ahead

665
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,320
I think Guitar Hero would have the potential to do well in Japan

666
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:34,080
But the thing is you have to really focus on how the Japanese gaming market does

667
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:41,880
They're going to stick more with the Bemani series. I'm sorry because there are you know, there's Namco has a guitar series out

668
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,280
a few other companies have

669
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,260
various other ones and still the most popular of them are still the Bimani

670
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:54,580
ones even if the other ones are better. I think the most likely thing to happen if

671
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:57,580
it were to happen in Japan and please please understand this is pure

672
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:01,940
speculation I think harmonics would probably license that out to someone

673
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:06,400
else to develop a Japanese version and I think or maybe you know like I don't

674
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,700
think it would be that same red octane harmonics I think they would sell out

675
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:13,140
the license the idea to somebody who's interested in localizing it for Japan.

676
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:17,700
engine yeah I mean who knows you know that that seems the most likely to me

677
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:21,540
but I don't see anything happening this year I would love to see like guitar

678
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:24,480
hero visual K Edition but what's interesting is that you know guitar

679
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,060
freaks V is still supposedly on its way we haven't heard anything in a while but

680
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:32,380
supposedly it's still coming in Japan so it's an interesting you know it would be

681
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:35,920
interesting if guitar hero were to come out to kind of counter this but would

682
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:41,620
you know would Konami get lawsuit II over it I don't know I don't I don't know

683
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:45,580
It's it's a whole nother can of worms there. Who knows? It's all speculation. So

684
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:51,340
Um, we also have an email from our friend Rob with two bees. We have a lot of Rob's tonight

685
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:53,400
I like that. This is a good mailbag night

686
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:56,140
You'd think so, wouldn't you?

687
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:04,300
Basically just to quote the email says there wasn't a true article but a link in dig comm is copied verbatim below in his email

688
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:12,300
It appears to be true because searching Target.com does reveal several classic compilations of old Sierra titles for Windows XP.

689
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:15,300
I talked about this last week, I might add.

690
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,300
Okay.

691
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:18,300
I'm just saying.

692
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:21,300
I'm reading the email, which has nothing to do with last week.

693
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:29,300
But basically the Sierra game titles are being re-released from Target.com, so just go ahead and check out Target.com.

694
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,300
There are a whole series of them.

695
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:34,860
Police Quest, Space Quest, King's Quest

696
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:38,640
which will explain why they didn't get out of the game tab. Oh no, Space Quest is on

697
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,300
game tab

698
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:43,380
so I kinda was hoping King's Quest would make its way. Anyway.

699
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:46,620
Also an email from

700
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:50,220
Justin who I helped with the song title

701
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:55,840
said he saw the Lemmings game for PSP out and released in the UK

702
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:59,020
and wondering if there was a way to import it and

703
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:02,740
you know if it would even play on the US PSP the answer to that is no I don't

704
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,100
think because aren't they

705
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:07,140
I don't know if they're region encoded PSP's aren't yeah they're not so

706
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:08,620
actually yeah you would be able to

707
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:12,700
to play it. I would just say you know

708
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:16,400
check Amazon I order from Amazon UK all the time

709
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,740
the reason why it's easier to do this with handhelds where you can cross

710
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:22,900
import and all that stuff and like you know Game Boy Advance games work Japan

711
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:23,620
US doesn't matter

712
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:26,940
is because the handhelds have their own screens the biggest problem you run into

713
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:27,500
with

714
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:33,340
the UK vs the US. Anything on TV is going to be PAL vs NTSC. You got it, and until everybody's

715
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:37,580
on high def we're always going to have this problem, so. However, you know, if you've

716
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:43,060
got a high definition screen in the imported system you will not run into a problem. One

717
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:49,100
thing of note on importing UMDs is that UMD movies are always region coded, so. Oh! This

718
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:52,940
is a general rule. That's what had me thinking because I knew the movies were, I didn't know

719
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:57,860
if the games were but yeah um but no you should have I suggest honestly suggest

720
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:04,140
Amazon I order CDs through Amazon UK and a Japanese Amazon all the time in fact

721
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:09,420
I'm gonna be paying $30 for a gorilla single in a couple of weeks freak all

722
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:17,860
right hey I didn't sit on the air we did not bring you here to be a fanboy just

723
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:23,680
kidding fanboy away it's fine hi me emailed us hi me not the hi me not me

724
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:30,160
yes I do remember this she told us about the Darwinian was this her I guess I

725
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:36,340
think I know I remember the name forget it go go ahead and go on okay um on the

726
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:39,940
topic of old shows I went back to an older show and listen to you guys talk

727
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:43,680
about some new portable system that was coming out soon at that time which

728
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:47,800
happened to be called the gizmondo and how it had potential though it needed

729
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:48,760
good games

730
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:49,680
uh...

731
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,120
you know the golden rule of the game systems

732
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:55,040
you guys are pretty accurate on that show if i remember correctly on your

733
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,440
predictions for the system

734
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:00,200
i was thinking about the best of show because i still have every show since

735
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,740
you guys have been on itunes

736
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:07,440
still up to listen to some of them the for a good laugh thank you

737
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,340
some good ones are weak of

738
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:13,400
eight one oh five to eight seven oh five

739
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:16,180
With that listen, I mean, I guess this is a mat quote

740
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:18,600
Loki quote, sorry

741
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:24,720
Listen, I'm not knocking the Mac or anything because granted the processing power may be what I'm looking for their cases look cool, though

742
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:30,040
Maybe he's okay their cases are nice and then Rob

743
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:35,480
Did we just go to bizarro orange challenge radio because I just heard Loki say something nice about the Macintosh. Oh

744
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:45,480
Oh, and then you said the cases look nice, but that's all they are, just big graphing calculators inside of a nice case.

745
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,480
I remember him saying that.

746
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,480
And then breaking out the Mega Man 2 sound.

747
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:54,480
Oh, that's right. Okay, yeah. You know what, there's some funny bits in the old stuff.

748
00:51:54,480 --> 00:52:08,800
You can dig 20 episodes back at O-L-R-P-S-P dot com, which will take you back to about

749
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:13,340
like November shows, but the other old stuff, you're going to have to wait until you put

750
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:14,340
out a CD.

751
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,280
Don't we have that wiki quote page or something?

752
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,280
There is a wiki quote page somewhere.

753
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,040
You need to put these up on wiki quote because these are hilarious.

754
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:24,040
There's one about the final thought that you did.

755
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:28,280
Yeah. It was, um, we were talking about Pizza Man.

756
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:32,520
Uh huh. And then, um, you said, uh,

757
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:35,640
no, I said, Al, your table got GTA on my elbow.

758
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:39,120
What? And then you said that, uh,

759
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:44,960
she said she got beat up by Pizza Man. And I probably played, yeah, I remember that show where we were dropping that sound effect. And you played the Mega Man theme.

760
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:50,080
Ah, check it out. Retro. But yeah, he's wanting more of our older, older, older shows.

761
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,960
Which, oh my god, the older shows.

762
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,840
Yeah, if you listen to episode one of our original live show,

763
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,680
or like Logan is talking in a tin can.

764
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,880
That's my horrible quote show, was the furry first show

765
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:04,380
when I talked about the king of iron fingering.

766
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:07,240
I don't know if that was the first, but it was the beginning.

767
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,080
I left the show with such a migraine,

768
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,280
because I was using that headset.

769
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,960
But you know what, those quotes that you put up,

770
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:16,700
dude, you would be our hero if you put them up on a Wiki

771
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:17,200
quote.

772
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,800
Or just put them on the forums.

773
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,240
We have a quote thread on our forums.

774
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,240
You should totally put them up there.

775
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:21,740
There you go.

776
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,560
It doesn't necessarily have to be the IRC.

777
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,260
OK, start a new thread on there.

778
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:26,680
Show quotes thread.

779
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,960
There you go.

780
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:29,600
OK.

781
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,240
Any other emails?

782
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:30,960
Yeah, we have a couple more, right?

783
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:31,460
Two more.

784
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:32,960
All right.

785
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:33,640
Let's hear it.

786
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:36,160
This is from Sakarina.

787
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,760
Hi, Sakarina, one of our big old regulars.

788
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:41,680
Hi, buddy, one of our Canadian listeners.

789
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:46,000
According to posters on DSMeat, actually it's DSMeat.com

790
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:54,600
UK game retailer chain GAME is selling a third-party headset for the DS.

791
00:53:54,600 --> 00:54:00,280
Apparently the headset works with mic-enabled games such as Nintendogs, and mic quality

792
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,500
is much better than the one built in the DS.

793
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:08,180
I think UK gamers might want to pick one of these up once Metroid Prime Hunters hits the

794
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:13,400
streets in May for Europeans in March for North American gamers.

795
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:18,760
That's the thing I always hated about Xbox Live and like people will be talking during

796
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:22,640
like full auto and stuff and I can't understand anything because I can't hear the sound effects

797
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:28,840
in music and if only they had better mics or weren't stupid.

798
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,640
Not being stupid does help.

799
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:34,600
We also, the last email comes from Aceman in Calgary.

800
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:35,600
Hi!

801
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,600
I like our Canadian listeners.

802
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:38,600
Of course.

803
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:39,600
I love Canada.

804
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,800
I'm actually, I am probably taking a trip to Canada.

805
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:42,800
You know what's funny?

806
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:46,640
on celebrating I've taken a vacation this is a me trip not a work trip the

807
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,320
last couple weeks was a work trip I'm gonna be taking a me trip I'm gonna

808
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:56,980
celebrate 4th of July in Canada that's going to Canada voluntarily yes I love

809
00:54:56,980 --> 00:55:01,560
Vancouver I want to go to Vancouver where I'm going I've never ever left the

810
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:06,400
United States and it looks like my trip to London next year is getting pushed

811
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:13,060
back again due to money so I really want to go to Canada I'm we're definitely

812
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:16,840
thinking about doing a fourth of July in Canada just to be ironic I think we'll

813
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:22,680
be fine so we'll see um I'll let you know anyway um there's a link on a the

814
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:29,800
sent to us by ace man about you a bowl deciding did not do any more video game

815
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:35,760
movies and there was much rejoicing yay and and actually it's a relink to a

816
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:42,060
you're a gamer article about you a bowl and basically it's a whole interview up

817
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:45,860
there and I'll see if I can't find the link to post in our chat room and maybe

818
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:54,700
repost on our website but basically there's a regarding the feedback that

819
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:58,940
he's received from gamers to quote the dangerous thing right now is that a lot

820
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:02,460
of people bash me without thinking about the movies it's fashionable to hit on

821
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:08,480
Unbelievable and this is what I don't get and I don't get why this comes so harshly from the game, press

822
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,780
There's another quote on here

823
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:16,260
I won't say I won't acquire another video game license in the future

824
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:19,640
But I'm not so eager to do it anymore to be honest after Far Cry

825
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:24,320
Maybe I'll go away from video game based movies and everybody can be really happy about it. Yes

826
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:30,020
We will are we supposed to be sympathetic because I'm not I'm not at all dude

827
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:36,060
he just you know I actually clicked on the the you're a you're a gamer article

828
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:38,900
I love you're a gamer if they have some of the best stuff but then another quote

829
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,740
on here says if people don't see that then it's not my problem but I think

830
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:46,020
that those people who hate me or want to bash me normal people people who buy

831
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:51,100
movies or watch TV they see that absolutely you know what um why don't

832
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:55,100
you just actually pay attention to what the gamers are telling you take it as

833
00:56:55,100 --> 00:57:00,400
feedback like any real professional would hello and actually follow that

834
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,400
feedback and put out a quality product instead of taking your own stupid little

835
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,640
take on it because you're just screwing it up and that's why people are bashed

836
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:12,400
you know maybe if people are bashing you it's because there's a reason they're

837
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,460
doing it and not necessarily because you know I'm sure one or two people out there

838
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:20,900
are just doing it to be buttheads but you know if you're getting it from me

839
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:23,980
and from the community as a whole world essentially

840
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:27,180
well I'm I'm focusing on the gaming community

841
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:29,940
but if you're focused but if you're getting this feedback from the gaming

842
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:31,340
community as a whole

843
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:34,820
why not listen you know you're taking

844
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:38,500
series that we all the least chunks of us

845
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:42,180
love and making a travesty of it you know

846
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:46,260
why not do what they're doing with Silent Hill? They're freaking working with Konami

847
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:46,740
on this

848
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:50,260
here's what he has to understand here's he doesn't get it because

849
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:54,120
He's getting all those people saying that the movie sucks, but he's selling millions

850
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:57,460
and millions of copies on DVD or whatever.

851
00:57:57,460 --> 00:58:01,520
Here's my analogy to the whole thing.

852
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:05,560
I'm under the assumption dog crap probably tastes like dog crap.

853
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,200
It's probably not very good.

854
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:11,840
Okay, well we know it's bad, but I'm not going to know how bad until I actually chew on a

855
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:13,560
piece of dog crap.

856
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,520
Same goes with Uwe Boll's movies.

857
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:19,800
I know they're bad, but I'm not going to subject myself to them to know how bad they really

858
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:25,200
are I just know they're so awful that I'm not gonna watch them worst analogy

859
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:34,760
ever actually I think the dog crap one is fairly rebel relevant fine mailbag at

860
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:39,680
orange lounge radio.com send us some love we love to get emails Oh baby more

861
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,520

862
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:45,640
stories we are gonna open Skype line very very very soon but not until we get

863
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:49,920
a story from Loki about Windows.

864
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:50,920
Go Windows.

865
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:53,440
Yes, Windows will be enhanced with Origami.

866
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,440
No, I don't know.

867
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:57,560
Windows Vista is going to have a gamer enhanced version.

868
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:00,060
Yes, that's right.

869
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:08,080
They're going to actually have basically this Windows Vista ultimate with a game performance

870
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:09,840
tweaker in it.

871
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:13,840
It's basically targeted towards high end PC users.

872
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:19,760
And they're going to have, I don't know, it's just another excuse for you to buy a damn

873
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,960
operating system.

874
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:27,120
It's going to have DirectX 10 stuff in there of course, because it's brand new Windows.

875
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:30,640
But I don't know.

876
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:34,260
It's one of like seven different versions of Vista that's coming out.

877
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:38,920
All of which no one will pay for and download off the internet.

878
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:44,760
So yeah, alright, I got a quick story for you guys here.

879
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:51,240
VIA Technologies has announced that they are establishing a training center for pro gamers.

880
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:55,720
It's called the House of Chrome and it's going to be in Sweden.

881
00:59:55,720 --> 01:00:01,480
This was actually originally created for VIA's sponsored pro gaming team Girls of Destruction

882
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:06,320
for them to train, but they will have guests and amateur gamers as well as upcoming contest

883
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:07,320
winners.

884
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:13,620
You could go to like game summer camp and train to be a girl of destruction or something

885
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:14,620
like that.

886
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:15,620
That's hot.

887
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:16,620
They have girls there.

888
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:17,620
That's awesome.

889
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:18,620
So that's what they do in Sweden.

890
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:22,900
I can meet a real girl.

891
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:26,900
We have an angry listener in Sweden who just unsubscribed from that.

892
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:33,260
Alright, anyway, Dark Sakura, you have a quick one for us too.

901
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:20,360
Mech Assault, Project Gotham 2, Shrek 2, and the one that makes me happy is Soul Calibur

902
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:25,800
2, which I already own on several systems, but still, Soul Calibur 2, which is really

903
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:26,800
cool.

904
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:29,000
That's cool, and it's like one of those things like, just buy it already if you don't have

905
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000

916
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:28,720
California. Let's go to the line and pick up a call. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

917
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:31,960
Holy crap, I made it on. Hi, who's this?

918
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:35,280
It's Ranma. Who else would it be? Hi Ranma, how are you?

919
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:38,660
I'm good. This was my buddy at KatsuKan.

920
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:42,240
Ranma's the reason I went to KatsuKan and put up with

921
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:47,080
six people at my panel. So, no, it was great though. It was a good

922
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:50,280
experience and I met some good... I did a lot of networking which was really good,

923
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:50,880
so

924
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:54,680
it was a good time. Dude, you gotta come back for thirteen.

925
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:58,460
Thinking about it, I already told you my Diva line.

926
01:02:58,460 --> 01:03:01,740
I'll only do it if my panel's at a certain time.

927
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:02,980
Hey, I'll help you out with that.

928
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:05,180
All right, sounds good.

929
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:07,060
Hey, I just want you to know that the gifts

930
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:09,740
that you sent along, I just handed out before the show.

931
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:15,700
So we have our matching Mario hats as like a present,

932
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:17,820
a late Christmas present, I guess, to Orange Lounge.

933
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:19,620
We're just a present for no real reason.

934
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:20,900
We got little Mario hats.

935
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:23,100
And I have an S for Sky, a red hat.

936
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:30,100
And then Dark Sakura has a pink hat for Princess DS Dark Sakura, and then Loki has an L for

937
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:32,900
not Luigi, but Loki, and a green hat, and it's really cool.

938
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:33,900
So we love the hats.

939
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:34,900
Thank you.

940
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:36,940
I'm so glad you like them.

941
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:38,940
What else is on your mind, buddy?

942
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:39,940
Not much.

943
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:42,580
I just came back from playing a couple of rounds of Drunken DDR this weekend.

944
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:43,580
Hot.

945
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:46,780
How'd that go?

946
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:50,700
The drinks weren't as strong as I thought they were, so I really couldn't get drunk

947
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,100
per se.

948
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:56,880
You know, the only time I ever really played drunk DDR was in Vegas, and I still got, like

949
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:01,460
this is when DDR was still new, and you would always get a crowd every time you played,

950
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:06,660
and you should have seen the crowd I got playing DDR while drunk, and I just remember, like

951
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:10,500
when you would do jumps, very heavy the jumps felt.

952
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:11,500
Very heavy.

953
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:12,500
So.

954
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:13,500
Alright.

955
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:17,500
You ever notice when you're playing DDR, you turn around after two songs, you have

956
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:21,980
like this entire crowd behind you, you just, and then on your next song you just fuck up

957
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:25,700
and then turn around people are gone I know it's it's kinda

958
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:28,380
it's like a it's like American Idol or something

959
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:32,660
it's like American Idol or something you screw up one week BAM you're voted off

960
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:36,180
I know it's just we're just playing DDR I mean

961
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:40,220
this weekend I was the only one that could really play everybody was just giving me requests

962
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:43,380
hey that's cool and I finally

963
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:47,420
checked out Strike it's not bad oh yeah I haven't checked it out yet

964
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:51,740
DDR Strike which just came out in Japan what's your favorite new song in Strike?

965
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:59,740
I must have drank it more than I suppose because I can't remember the one song I love the most on there.

966
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:01,740
I've heard a lot of good things about the new Akira song.

967
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:05,740
I don't think I played that one.

968
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:06,740
I'm sure.

969
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:07,740
It's a good song.

970
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:09,740
Doll? I've heard a lot of good things about Doll.

971
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:12,740
Let's Dance, David Bowie, you know that's got to rock.

972
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:14,740
I'm so excited about that.

973
01:05:14,740 --> 01:05:15,740
That's the one.

974
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:16,740
There it is, alright, there you go.

975
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:17,740
That loves me some David Bowie.

976
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:22,740
All right, Rama, we gotta get to other callers, but anything else you want to share with our listeners?

977
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:25,740
When is Loki doing more fusions?

978
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:28,740
Oh, we need doing more fusion mixes, Loki. It's been a while.

979
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:31,740
Don't you have anything on MySpace? You haven't plugged that in a long time.

980
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:33,740
Yeah, but it doesn't have anything new on it, though.

981
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:36,740
No, still, a lot of our podcast listeners probably don't even know you do these.

982
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:39,740
MySpace.com slash Loki Fusion.

983
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:41,740
It's all one word, Loki Fusion.

984
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:43,740
Yeah, all one word.

985
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:46,740
I don't know. I've been dabbling, but I haven't...

986
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:53,740
The last thing I did was the not finished version of Legend of the Trance 2006 or something.

987
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:57,740
That was about the last thing I did. I haven't really done anything since then.

988
01:05:57,740 --> 01:06:09,740
I've been fighting writer's block, trying to do something original for that Konami contest thing.

989
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:13,740
But yeah, it hasn't been working out too well.

990
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:16,720
It's tough, I used to be able to do it so easy,

991
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:20,740
back when I was working with like Techno EJ2 years ago.

992
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:24,060
Such a very elementary program,

993
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:26,740
but it's very easy to come up with stuff.

994
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:28,320
And now it's a lot harder though,

995
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:29,780
when you're working with better samples

996
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:30,860
and different programs and stuff,

997
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:33,040
it's not as user friendly as the old ones.

998
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:36,540
All right, Rama, we gotta let you go get some more calls,

999
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:38,180
but thanks so much for your phone call, okay?

1000
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:39,340
Got it, see you laters.

1001
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:40,820
See ya.

1002
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:42,300
By the way, I forgot to mention tonight

1005
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:56,020
Oscars right now you do know that all those votes are bought right and the

1006
01:06:56,020 --> 01:07:00,900

1007

1009

We're having a hard time hearing you, buddy. So sorry. Gotta let you go.

1012
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:32,240
Be sure to give Echo123 a call and you can always hear what you sound like there,

1013
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:39,240
or of course, you can always try the phone number 916-226-9067, which generally has very few problems.

1014
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:41,840
Let's try another call. Hi, you're on orange lounge radio

1015
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:45,140
Hey, how's it going? Hi good. Who's this?

1016
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:49,000
This is DMN. Hi DMN. What's on your mind, buddy?

1017
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:55,140
Well first I want to know if you guys have heard have any thoughts on a Tetris DS. I

1018
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:01,120
Cannot wait for Tetris DS because I have very fond memories of Tetris on the Gameboy

1019
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:06,000
And I just I love that they're just redoing it and it's gonna be the whole like ten players

1020
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,780
locally and all that stuff it's gonna be a good time great party game everybody

1021
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:14,880
got Tetris is like the anybody can play Tetris that's the nice thing about it

1022
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:18,320
it's such an easily accessible game you know I think it's gonna make it a lot of

1023
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:21,600
fun and get new people you know on the DS and stuff it's gonna be a good time

1024
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:26,960
you can say well I tested it and I had a huge blast with it you tested it yeah I

1025
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:33,440
kind of work over at Nintendo oh oh too bad you're under ndas or I'd be I'd be

1026
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:38,740
grilling you for the scoop right now it's worth the 30 bucks when it comes

1027
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:42,740
out I guarantee it awesome that's a great tip what about I have to ask

1028
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:46,060
Metroid Prime Hunters I'm kind of getting mixed mixed feelings on this one

1029
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:52,860
did you get well oh I played the demo I have the demo my impressions that are

1030
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:56,740
that first-person shooters do not work on a portables I played doom and on the

1031
01:08:56,740 --> 01:09:02,500
GBA and it was terrible the demo was just atrocious I don't think it's gonna

1032
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:04,300
to do well at all.

1033
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:09,300
Now, I gotta ask, since you work in the inside, and maybe this is NDA, so feel free to deflect

1034
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:12,420
if you must, but do you know something about the revolution that the rest of the world

1035
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:14,140
doesn't?

1036
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:16,540
I know the same thing you do right now, which is nothing.

1037
01:09:16,540 --> 01:09:18,460
We haven't seen it in the department.

1038
01:09:18,460 --> 01:09:19,460
Interesting.

1039
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:20,460
Huh.

1040
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:22,380
Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners?

1041
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:24,020
What's going on over there?

1042
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:27,980
Well, I might as well plug my anime convention up here.

1043
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:29,940
I'm the gaming manager of Sakura Con.

1044
01:09:29,940 --> 01:09:31,820
It's in downtown Seattle.

1045
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:33,020
It's going to be a lot of fun.

1046
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:35,220
It's going to be March 24th of the 26th.

1047
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:36,220
Son of a gun.

1048
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:40,540
Somebody's trying to get me to come up to Sakura Con.

1049
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:42,780
It's one of those things where it's like if I can get the time off work, I would go, but

1050
01:09:42,780 --> 01:09:43,780
I don't know.

1051
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:46,620
It's over a weekend, right?

1052
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:49,620
Different weekend as what?

1053
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:53,940
Well, I mean, it's Friday through Sunday, right?

1054
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:55,980
Yeah, it's Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

1055
01:09:55,980 --> 01:09:58,620
You'd be totally stupid to have a con during the week, so I hope so.

1056
01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:02,620
Hey, tell that to the people who do anime expo, okay?

1057
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:06,620
I don't know, I'd be down for at least a day of that.

1058
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:10,620
How can I pass up Sakurakan?

1059
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:14,620
We'll think of a way to get there. I don't know. It's gonna take some clever plotting.

1060
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:18,620
Seattle's not that far of a flight from here. I'll have to open up the cosplay box

1061
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:22,620
and break out the bike in costume. We'll see what we can do.

1062
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:26,620
We're also venturing a new part of DDR. We're combining a DDR and a game show, so we're gonna

1063
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:30,700
see how that works out awesome I want to see this hey if we come up can we get

1064
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:34,820
like a panel or something or is it too late don't I think it's a little late

1065
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:40,220
but um I could probably see if I could swing you guys in as a you know industry

1066
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:43,900
guests or something that would rock let's talk offline send us an email okay

1067
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:47,540

1071
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:03,980
random call dude worked at Nintendo big big big big wig in this convention that

1072
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:07,420

01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:11,900
thought someone in the Washington working at Nintendo also later in the

1074
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:17,460
year my husband and I were planning a trip to go to Prosser and Kennewick

1075

1076
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:28,700

1082
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:49,100
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1083
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:51,720
Hello.

1084
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:52,980
Hi, who's this?

1085
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:54,540
Intended Maniac 64.

1086
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:55,820
Hi, what's on your mind?

1087
01:11:57,340 --> 01:11:58,460
I'm real angry.

1088
01:11:58,460 --> 01:12:00,940
Keep Orange Lounge Radio to work in Winamp.

1089
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:02,340
Orange Lounge Radio doesn't work in Winamp?

1090
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:03,520
What's going on?

1091
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:04,420
I don't know.

1092
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:08,220
Keeps asking me to log in with my Live 365 account.

1093
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:11,140
Live 365 gives us issues sometimes.

1094
01:12:11,140 --> 01:12:17,380
Are you letting the computer retain cookies?

1095
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:22,660
You know what, do us a favor, send live365 an email.

1096
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:26,380
I wish there was more we could do on that end, but there's really unfortunately not

1097
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:27,380
a lot.

1098
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:31,660
Believe me though, we are aware and every time things like this happen, it makes us

1099
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:34,340
not want to be there anymore.

1100
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:36,580
But you know, we're kind of stuck for right now.

1101
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:40,860
Well I'm living with real player right now, I know, many people don't like it.

1102
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:46,460
works. I use iTunes sometimes, but the thing is that Winamp is the only way you can get MP3 Pro.

1103
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:51,580
Little known fact, the podcast is actually encoded in MP3 Pro, so if you listen to the podcast in

1104
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:56,380
Winamp with the codec, it actually sounds a lot cleaner, so just a little thought there. Okay,

1105
01:12:56,380 --> 01:13:00,300
cool. All right, well Nintendo Maniac, thanks for the call. Anything else you want to share?

1106
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:05,740
Unlike the last guy, I'm actually excited about Metroid Prime Hunters.

1107
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:14,340
any particular reason why well online multiplayer maybe I guess yeah yeah

1108
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:17,860
that's another online player I'm just curious if that's gonna be as cool as it

1109
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:23,180
sounds I'm looking forward to it though okay all right take care buddy thanks

1110
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:28,100
for calling see ya later all right thank you guys so much for calling in we

1111
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:33,540
appreciate it there that's our skype line let's get back into the news for

1112
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:37,340
one last story here tonight

1113
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:40,180
actually first before I get to the last story I'll go around see if there's any last

1114
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:41,160
minute entries here

1115
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:44,300
Loki because I think I saw you bring up something on the origami is that like a

1116
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:44,900
last minute

1117
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:48,800
edition here? It was just a picture of it and it's a little bit smaller than the

1118
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,540
concept video that they show because that video is pretty old

1119
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:54,700
but still I think I could

1120
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:58,460
take somebody out with this thing. We've been given this thing a hard time

1121
01:13:58,460 --> 01:13:58,840
tonight

1122
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:02,700
honestly if I have the money to throw away on something like if I was a

1123
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:06,140
a business person that made a lot of money, maybe I would check this out.

1124
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:10,660
But until we hear about some gaming stuff, it's still going to be the butt of our jokes.

1125
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:11,660
Sorry.

1126
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:12,660
Yeah.

1127
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:13,660
Anyways.

1128
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:17,380
Well, first thing I got to mention, because this is like a major story, we're just kind

1129
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:18,700
of glancing over.

1130
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:19,700
Oh, sorry.

1131
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:21,620
DS Lite actually launched in Japan.

1132
01:14:21,620 --> 01:14:22,620
Oh, yeah.

1133
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:23,620
I thought you covered...

1134
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:24,620
And it's so pretty.

1135
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:26,260
I thought you covered this on one of the mini-shows for some reason.

1136
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:29,000
Well, I may have mentioned it, but yeah, DS Lite launched.

1137
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,420
It's pretty, it's bright.

1138
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:35,140
That's everything we had hoped for, so yeah, that's kind of cool.

1139
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:40,580
And then, what else was I going to mention here, of course, if you like, what was I going

1140
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:49,900
to say, Geometry Wars, there's a nice little knockoff here you can download at www.incitti.com

1141
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:56,040
slash blitz, and they've got a nice little game you can play here that's a clone of Geometry

1142
01:14:56,040 --> 01:15:00,300
Wars 3, and also another game called Marble Insanity, which is just like Marble Madness.

1143
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:04,160
And unfortunately, that's not available for download yet, but it looks really sweet with

1144
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:05,160
what they're doing.

1145
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:09,020
And finally, of course, Rockstar announced a new game that they're making this week,

1146
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:10,980
and it's Table Tennis!

1147
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:11,980
Yes!

1148
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:12,980
Table Tennis for the 360!

1149
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:13,980
Oh yeah!

1150
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:18,360
Nothing that I would rather have more than Grand Theft Auto is...

1151
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:19,360
Table Tennis!

1152
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:23,980
Unfortunately, you can't take people's heads off of the, you know, the ping pong ball,

1153
01:15:23,980 --> 01:15:24,980
but um...

1154
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:25,980
Yeah.

1155
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:26,980
I get it.

1156
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:31,260
There's a code that you put in and the chick will start doing tricks with ping pong balls,

1157
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:32,260
right?

1158
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:37,540
And as I mentioned before, Trauma Center is coming out for the revolution, so it's according

1159
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:39,580
to the IGN podcast.

1160
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:44,180
If you didn't get that joke, by the way, ask your mommy and daddy.

1161
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:45,180
Don't tell them you heard it here.

1162
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:48,940
Ubisoft announced that they're going to be releasing a new Rainbow Six game for next

1163
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:55,060
Gen consoles, Rainbow Six Vegas. And this has actually come from the brand new issue

1164
01:15:55,060 --> 01:16:02,060
of EGM. So, looks pretty sweet so far. And also, Bungie says that I Love Bees 2 is fake.

1165
01:16:05,620 --> 01:16:12,620
So... I hate viral marketing because viral marketing is not viral anymore. It's just

1166
01:16:12,620 --> 01:16:18,260
because viral marketing is not viral anymore it's just no one cares it's

1167
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:23,700
trendy it's stupid it's like before you know people didn't know what they were

1168
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:27,820
advertising it was just something that's like wow is this you know and you try to

1169
01:16:27,820 --> 01:16:32,540
figure out more information like the whole thing with about the Xbox 360 that

1170
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:35,940
was kind of cool because you know they they were leaking information through

1171
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:41,380
there and stuff but you know having a counter on Ubisoft's you know site you

1172
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:46,600
splinter cell site you know saying it happens to be counting back 360 hours

1173
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:50,400
hmm I wonder if that could be an announcement for the splinter cell for

1174
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:58,120
the 360 or you know whatever it's just retarded just my rant there all right

1175
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:02,500
dark soccer you have any last stories for us just out of curiosity anything

1176
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:06,680
you've been holding out on just wanted to check I will continue to keep my

1177
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:10,240
secrets all right well here I have something that might interest you this

1178
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:12,800
seems like something you'd get a kick out of because it's Sega related and we

1179
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:16,720
know you're a Sega fangirl here it is and this is a story that ran on joystick

1180
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:21,320
earlier this week did you know that there was a pen and teller Sega CD game

1181
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:26,240
it was I didn't know that it was pen and teller smoke and mirrors is what it was

1182
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:29,280
called it was never released actually which is why you've probably never heard

1183
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:33,600
of it but get this there actually is a torrent out there now floating on the

1184
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:38,560
internet so you can download it burn it and just load it up in the Sega CD

1185
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:41,960
there's actually a part in this game that the article talks about called the

1186
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:45,880
desert bus minigame you drive a bus in the desert your goal is to go from

1187
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:50,740
Tucson Arizona to Las Vegas your bus never goes more than 45 miles an hour so

1188
01:17:50,740 --> 01:17:54,720
the trip takes approximately eight hours in real time to make there's no scenery

1189
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:58,960
or even other cars on the road just plain desert for eight hours oh and your

1190
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:01,980
bus veers to the right just slightly so it's impossible to just take down a

1191
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:05,780
button and go do something else rumor has it that if you make it to Vegas you

1192
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:12,780
score one point sounds awesome can't wait to play it I never released imagine

1193
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:19,180
that I have one more story but it's quite funny okay I wanted the last story

1194
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:24,820
hmm French developer cyanide has launched their online home of their

1195
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:33,060
forthcoming action RPG Loki you ass there's not a whole lot of content on

1196
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:39,180
the site at the moment just a forum and some screenshots but my guess is gonna

1197
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:45,220
be it's based around my life shut up as exciting as it is trolls and all no but

1198
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:50,580
um I just had to point out because you know it's funny all right on that

1199
01:18:50,580 --> 01:18:55,340
egotistical note it's time to end the show our special guest spike our buddy

1202
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:07,820

1205
01:19:15,580 --> 01:19:18,860
any final thoughts for our listeners

1206
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:24,700
quiz and dragons look buddy that's a challenge you're issuing a

1207
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:28,220
challenge here all right uh loki your final thought

1208
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:30,020
uh...

1209
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:33,480
yeah i'm gonna i can't wait to play some new games this week

1210
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:35,060
burnout and uh...

1211
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:39,020
like i guess burnout is not exactly a new game but

1212
01:19:39,020 --> 01:19:39,860
i don't know

1213
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:42,440
i looked forward to playing burnout again

1214
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:46,140
uh... my final thought is the oscars are a sham

1215
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:50,100
why don't you just go watch a movie that looks interesting and not that somebody

1216
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:52,360
told you to watch or told you that was good

1217
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:54,360
make up your own mind

1218
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:57,920
They pay millions of dollars for those ads in variety.

1219
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:01,280
It's a sham. Go outside.

1220
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:06,440
Support independent films too. You can watch a big blockbuster once in a while, but don't forget to go to your

1221
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:09,780
local art house cinema because you might be missing something good. Dark Soccer, your final thought.
