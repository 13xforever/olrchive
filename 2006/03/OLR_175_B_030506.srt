9
00:01:06,355 --> 00:01:08,677
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's get back into some gaming news here.

10
00:01:22,265 --> 00:01:22,905
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

11
00:01:50,575 --> 00:01:50,875
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

12
00:02:19,016 --> 00:02:22,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Sony is selling the Metreon complex and who do they sell it to?

13
00:02:23,339 --> 00:02:31,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Mall developer, the Westfield Group and the Forest City Enterprises real estate company for an undisclosed amount of money.

14
00:02:31,845 --> 00:02:38,230
[SPEAKER_08]: So Sony will continue to operate the official PlayStation store in the mall, but as for the rest of the stuff there...

15
00:02:39,352 --> 00:02:41,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows what we could see going up in there pretty soon.

16
00:02:41,834 --> 00:02:43,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe Abercrombie and Fitch, for all we know.

17
00:02:44,036 --> 00:02:45,678
[SPEAKER_08]: That would just be peachy, wouldn't it?

18
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:46,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Boo-hiss.

19
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,820
[SPEAKER_08]: No idea what's going to happen to the walk of game just yet.

20
00:02:50,342 --> 00:02:51,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

21
00:02:51,122 --> 00:02:58,849
[SPEAKER_08]: But many of us DDR fans, like NorCal especially, with fond memories of Medtron, except for Loki who somehow missed it all, it's kind of sad.

22
00:02:59,289 --> 00:03:00,871
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes me a little verklempt.

23
00:03:00,891 --> 00:03:02,212
[SPEAKER_08]: A little bit.

24
00:03:02,512 --> 00:03:03,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk amongst yourselves.

25
00:03:04,113 --> 00:03:05,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, but life goes on.

26
00:03:05,415 --> 00:03:06,816
[SPEAKER_08]: So, moving on...

27
00:03:07,352 --> 00:03:08,113
[SPEAKER_08]: to another story.

28
00:03:08,433 --> 00:03:15,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, you got some interesting, you had some real great exclusives in the first part there about PlayStation 3 and Revolution.

29
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:15,759
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you got now?

30
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:24,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this is kind of, you can file it under rumor, how Sony plans on combating the Revolution.

31
00:03:25,368 --> 00:03:31,093
[SPEAKER_07]: And the way they're going to do that, well, of course, it's going to be with the PlayStation 2 and the iToy.

32
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:45,425
[SPEAKER_07]: What they're planning on doing is because the PlayStation 2 is already an established console system out there, they're still producing them, and they're anticipating that the price point is going to drop down to $99 in 2007.

33
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:53,430
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, with the iToy, they're anticipating that you'll be able to use this to create some really revolutionary games.

34
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,193
[SPEAKER_07]: The only problem with that is the iToy doesn't work that good.

35
00:03:59,538 --> 00:04:00,999
[SPEAKER_07]: I know this from first-hand experience.

36
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,841
[SPEAKER_07]: And let me put it this way.

37
00:04:05,262 --> 00:04:11,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Wiping windows down and looking like a jackass while dancing on screen, not revolutionary.

38
00:04:11,226 --> 00:04:13,727
[SPEAKER_08]: iToy Kinetic was fun for a day.

39
00:04:14,528 --> 00:04:19,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Waste of $50 because my apartment does not light good enough.

40
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,712
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it just does not work for iToy.

41
00:04:22,153 --> 00:04:24,054
[SPEAKER_08]: And while I could go to Ikea and buy a lamp...

42
00:04:24,727 --> 00:04:29,248
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not changing the house around to make the iToy work.

43
00:04:29,268 --> 00:04:38,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Granted, when they're showing off the iToy games and they're against a nice white backdrop, that's the perfect environment for the iToy.

44
00:04:39,951 --> 00:04:44,472
[SPEAKER_07]: But most of us people, we live in rooms with more than white in the room.

45
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Like posters and paintings.

46
00:04:46,432 --> 00:04:47,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

47
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:48,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Not good.

48
00:04:49,929 --> 00:05:00,275
[SPEAKER_07]: But some of the other stuff that they're talking about, and this is actually kind of another thing that Xbox is doing too with their camera, is they're going to be using multiple cameras to track movement.

49
00:05:00,935 --> 00:05:02,956
[SPEAKER_07]: That's more something on the Xbox 360 front.

50
00:05:02,976 --> 00:05:03,677
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to be using that.

51
00:05:03,717 --> 00:05:12,402
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, they also showed how they can render your face in there by doing a screen cap of your face, you know, facing forward and sideways, and then render it 3D.

52
00:05:13,082 --> 00:05:17,164
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're also going to be using that kind of as an eye toy or revolution thing as well.

53
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:18,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me put it this way.

54
00:05:18,962 --> 00:05:20,342
[SPEAKER_07]: and B, The Revolution.

55
00:05:21,182 --> 00:05:21,582
[SPEAKER_07]: No!

56
00:05:22,963 --> 00:05:26,103
[SPEAKER_08]: It wouldn't be that revolutionary if it were just that simple.

57
00:05:26,463 --> 00:05:27,284
[SPEAKER_08]: This is all rumor.

58
00:05:27,424 --> 00:05:30,404
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not good enough to combat the revolution thing.

59
00:05:31,284 --> 00:05:38,546
[SPEAKER_08]: There's other things that are going to set the PS3 apart from the revolution, just as there's going to be things that set Xbox 360 apart from it.

60
00:05:38,826 --> 00:05:41,106
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no need for these guys to all try and copy each other.

61
00:05:41,126 --> 00:05:45,627
[SPEAKER_07]: The only good thing about the PlayStation 2 is it's not going to be as expensive as the PlayStation 3.

62
00:05:48,434 --> 00:05:55,699
[SPEAKER_08]: Comments from our chatroom, www.orangeloungeradio.com We love the interactivity that taping live on Sunday nights brings us here.

63
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,022
[SPEAKER_08]: GS191 says, iToy, good concept, terrible games.

64
00:05:59,362 --> 00:06:03,025
[SPEAKER_08]: What makes you think that the PS3 X360 camera is going to be better?

65
00:06:03,985 --> 00:06:04,486
[SPEAKER_08]: Good point.

66
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:12,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Going back to the Metreon story there earlier, somebody had said... I'm trying to find the thing here.

67
00:06:13,132 --> 00:06:14,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody had said that...

68
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:22,772
[SPEAKER_08]: Old tech TV shows had been taped at the Metreon, so it kind of further... Oh, Tomokun said, dude, it had tech TV shows taped there.

69
00:06:23,052 --> 00:06:28,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to further add insult to injury to the whole, you know, tech TV is long gone type thing.

70
00:06:28,235 --> 00:06:28,896
[SPEAKER_07]: They had X-Play.

71
00:06:29,016 --> 00:06:30,356
[SPEAKER_07]: X-Play used to be recorded.

72
00:06:30,476 --> 00:06:32,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Or before X-Play, what the hell was it called?

73
00:06:32,357 --> 00:06:33,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Extended Play.

74
00:06:33,098 --> 00:06:36,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Extended Play was recorded there.

75
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:37,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Sad.

76
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:40,822
[SPEAKER_08]: And now it's going to be just a giant Abercrombie & Fitch.

77
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:41,282
[SPEAKER_08]: Just wait.

78
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:44,064
[SPEAKER_08]: Banana Republic going in there as well.

79
00:06:45,635 --> 00:06:46,376
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, moving in.

80
00:06:46,476 --> 00:06:48,138
[SPEAKER_08]: I made all that up, by the way.

81
00:06:48,218 --> 00:06:52,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on, EA, we talked about in the first half a little bit there.

82
00:06:53,104 --> 00:07:04,979
[SPEAKER_08]: The VP over at EA, Dr. I'm going to say this, so horrible, Jens Uwe Intat, foresees that there will be a shift coming within the next 10 years.

83
00:07:06,046 --> 00:07:11,588
[SPEAKER_08]: CDs, DVDs, and box games will be as antiquated as cassette tapes and vinyl records.

84
00:07:12,108 --> 00:07:15,309
[SPEAKER_08]: What are they going in favor of there?

85
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Downloadable media.

86
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:22,192
[SPEAKER_08]: They're saying that the downloadable media is going to be the shift there in 10 years there.

87
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:30,337
[SPEAKER_08]: and of course you look at the success of iTunes and you think it's just a matter of time before movies start being distributed the same way.

88
00:07:30,397 --> 00:07:32,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Heck, it's already happening on iTunes.

89
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:35,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Some shows that maybe aren't even doing that successful on TV.

90
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,179
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't know.

91
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:41,401
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm thinking The Office does really, really well on iTunes and it does okay on TV.

92
00:07:41,781 --> 00:07:46,162
[SPEAKER_08]: But it does really well on iTunes so it might be the future outlet for TV.

93
00:07:46,462 --> 00:07:49,143
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course independent vidcasting getting bigger and bigger.

94
00:07:49,423 --> 00:07:52,584
[SPEAKER_08]: Well now, why not the same model apply to games?

95
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they're also probably going to start streaming.

96
00:07:55,483 --> 00:08:03,229
[SPEAKER_07]: You have the DirecTV tab that's going to be coming to the Xbox Live, your desktop there.

97
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:09,595
[SPEAKER_07]: They're also going to be having location-free players for the PlayStation 3.

98
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:20,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, you've got the news that PlayStation 3 in Korea is going to start doing direct downloads of games straight to your hard drive because they want to combat piracy there, and they're going to offer them at less than retail.

99
00:08:23,585 --> 00:08:27,166
[SPEAKER_07]: And hell, we're doing it right now with the Xbox Live Arcade, just in a smaller format.

100
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:33,608
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I went to a panel at KatsuCon, and I asked a question about this, and I practically got laughed at.

101
00:08:34,228 --> 00:08:41,070
[SPEAKER_08]: And people were saying, Xbox Live Arcade does not pose a threat to the regular system of downloading games.

102
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:48,492
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm thinking, okay, well now I've got this EA vice president backing me up, which I need to point out, he's actually Electronic Arts Europe vice president, so sorry.

103
00:08:48,772 --> 00:08:49,753
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not clarifying that earlier.

104
00:08:50,714 --> 00:08:56,078
[SPEAKER_08]: That this downloadable games thing is going to be more and more of a force, I think.

105
00:08:56,678 --> 00:08:57,559
[SPEAKER_08]: So, we'll see.

106
00:08:57,619 --> 00:08:59,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, one thing he does say that, you know,

107
00:09:00,633 --> 00:09:02,614
[SPEAKER_08]: is a bit of an interesting point here.

108
00:09:03,314 --> 00:09:10,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Apple has kept their song prices at 99 cents per song, and this is a low figure that kind of makes people in the music business a little bit angry here.

109
00:09:11,396 --> 00:09:13,176
[SPEAKER_08]: iTunes essentially has a monopoly.

110
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:22,079
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Entente seems to think that with so many consoles available, there's not going to be a monopoly possible if this model works with games.

111
00:09:23,126 --> 00:09:23,887
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to happen.

112
00:09:24,107 --> 00:09:24,888
[SPEAKER_07]: I can tell you this much.

113
00:09:25,188 --> 00:09:26,629
[SPEAKER_07]: And here's why it's not going to happen.

114
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:30,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you have all the major retailers that make a lot of money off of these games.

115
00:09:31,414 --> 00:09:33,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, you've got rental chains.

116
00:09:34,056 --> 00:09:38,360
[SPEAKER_07]: If we all start streaming media, what's going to happen to the whole rental market?

117
00:09:38,421 --> 00:09:38,941
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gone.

118
00:09:39,622 --> 00:09:43,105
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got GameStop and freaking EB.

119
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:48,450
[SPEAKER_07]: They're the same company now, but their whole business is game purchasing and stuff.

120
00:09:49,372 --> 00:09:50,273
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to happen.

121
00:09:51,454 --> 00:09:58,780
[SPEAKER_07]: If that happens, they're going to lose money from all these different outlets and then... Well, what about moving with the seas of change, though?

122
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Tower Records doesn't still primarily make their business off records in the sense that we know them.

123
00:10:04,344 --> 00:10:10,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Blockbuster realizes that people like the Netflix model, so they copy it and do their own thing.

124
00:10:10,469 --> 00:10:15,253
[SPEAKER_08]: What's to say that GameStop isn't one of the online services that decides to get in on that?

125
00:10:15,293 --> 00:10:15,793
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, who knows?

126
00:10:16,034 --> 00:10:18,836
[SPEAKER_08]: This is obviously all huge amounts of speculation, but you know...

127
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,066
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a good question to ask.

128
00:10:21,086 --> 00:10:22,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Where will gaming be in 10 years?

129
00:10:22,347 --> 00:10:23,408
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an excellent idea.

130
00:10:23,508 --> 00:10:29,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, those 28 hard drives that they were packaging with the Xbox 360s, not going to work.

131
00:10:29,055 --> 00:10:31,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, but in 10 years, we're not going to be talking Xbox 360.

132
00:10:31,137 --> 00:10:34,581
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to be talking Xbox 1080 or something.

133
00:10:34,621 --> 00:10:34,921
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

134
00:10:37,124 --> 00:10:37,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, whatever.

135
00:10:37,705 --> 00:10:38,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, forget it.

136
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:42,268
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, moving on.

137
00:10:42,588 --> 00:10:43,808
[SPEAKER_08]: We got another story here.

138
00:10:44,328 --> 00:10:47,189
[SPEAKER_08]: Several stories, actually, from DarkSakura.

139
00:10:47,349 --> 00:10:57,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Since we had a little comment there from the Electronic Arts Vice President over in Europe, why not give our pals over in Europe a little more information on what's going on in their neck of the woods?

140
00:10:57,412 --> 00:10:58,552
[SPEAKER_08]: And Jamie, you keep tabs on that?

141
00:10:58,592 --> 00:10:58,952
[SPEAKER_08]: What's going on?

142
00:10:58,972 --> 00:11:00,053
[SPEAKER_02]: We thought they were gone.

143
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:01,893
[SPEAKER_02]: We thought we heard the last of them.

144
00:11:02,473 --> 00:11:04,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Acclaim is back.

145
00:11:04,734 --> 00:11:05,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

146
00:11:05,714 --> 00:11:08,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, with a free MMO, actually.

147
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:08,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

148
00:11:09,412 --> 00:11:10,993
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called BOTS.

149
00:11:11,793 --> 00:11:13,014
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like it's all capitalized.

150
00:11:13,314 --> 00:11:15,635
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm already bored.

151
00:11:15,795 --> 00:11:19,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, they're describing it as a title that will appeal to everyone.

152
00:11:20,858 --> 00:11:27,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you start off with adaptable, upgradable little robots that are supposedly really cute.

153
00:11:27,701 --> 00:11:28,461
[SPEAKER_02]: I can do cute.

154
00:11:30,049 --> 00:11:35,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Story about some evil virus, PvP, capture the flag, that kind of stuff.

155
00:11:37,276 --> 00:11:40,699
[SPEAKER_02]: But you were supposed to have these near infinite combinations of upgrades.

156
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,543
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there was a game like this back in the days of the Sega CD.

157
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,665
[SPEAKER_02]: It also reminds me of the Enix SNES game RoboTrek.

158
00:11:47,685 --> 00:11:47,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

159
00:11:47,865 --> 00:11:48,746
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um...

160
00:12:06,596 --> 00:12:08,557
[SPEAKER_02]: At any rate, they're working on this.

161
00:12:09,137 --> 00:12:15,781
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually a new Acclaim Games website where they have their beta tests up there to register for.

162
00:12:16,161 --> 00:12:21,544
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also a future title coming out called, it's a martial arts MMO called Nine Dragons.

163
00:12:22,044 --> 00:12:26,567
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you just go to Acclaim.com, it's the first link on there.

164
00:12:27,507 --> 00:12:28,628
[SPEAKER_02]: The first little image there.

165
00:12:29,104 --> 00:12:30,004
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'll sign up for it.

166
00:12:30,024 --> 00:12:30,865
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks really cute.

167
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:49,835
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually looks pretty neat.

168
00:12:50,396 --> 00:12:50,976
[SPEAKER_08]: This is funny.

169
00:12:50,996 --> 00:12:52,077
[SPEAKER_08]: We got a comment in our chat room here.

170
00:12:52,118 --> 00:12:54,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Ranma says, I saw the site for Acclaim's bots.

171
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,222
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks just like the Ragnarok Online page.

172
00:12:57,322 --> 00:12:57,883
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.

173
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:01,006
[SPEAKER_08]: It's laid out just like a website for a Korean MMO.

174
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:04,609
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Ragnarok Online, so I think I'll give the bots a try.

175
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:05,570
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

176
00:13:06,671 --> 00:13:13,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Ragnarok Online certainly was cute, and it was the only game I've ever played that would allow my male character to wear a bow in his head.

177
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:16,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have that photo.

178
00:13:17,098 --> 00:13:19,522
[SPEAKER_08]: It was on my cell phone for forever.

179
00:13:19,562 --> 00:13:20,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, moving on.

180
00:13:20,524 --> 00:13:21,326
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss Ragnarok.

181
00:13:26,912 --> 00:13:50,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, anyway, uh, next up, uh, a comment by, uh, uh, Roger Bennett, who is the general director of, uh, UK Video Games Publisher Trade Body, ELSPA, said there's complete and utter nonsense about a speech made in Parliament by the Labour MP, Keith Vaz, uh, stating, uh, about new laws, or, relating to video game ratings.

182
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:51,519
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought this up earlier.

183
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:53,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

184
00:13:55,442 --> 00:14:00,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, gamesindustry.biz was told, and I quote,

185
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:19,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Vaz was proposing an amendment to the Video Recordings Act in 1984 that would make it mandatory for video games to receive content ratings the same way that films do.

186
00:14:20,584 --> 00:14:27,166
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a voluntary... The PEGI rating system is all voluntary to coincide with that.

187
00:14:27,806 --> 00:14:30,927
[SPEAKER_02]: But he was arguing in Parliament that the current system...

188
00:14:33,609 --> 00:14:47,015
[SPEAKER_02]: where basically it sees the PEGI ratings being complemented by the British Board of Film Classification to go along the same lines, but they're saying that's very confusing.

189
00:14:50,017 --> 00:14:51,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me get the next quote on here.

190
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:56,640
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very long article that I've been digesting over this.

191
00:14:58,621 --> 00:15:07,569
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically, it was going back, Bennett stated, the fact of the matter is that we're one of only two countries in the whole 27 states in the European Union who have mandatory ratings.

192
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:13,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Everywhere else in Europe, these ratings are on the boxes, the PEGI ratings, and they make informed decisions for their kids.

193
00:15:14,876 --> 00:15:18,920
[SPEAKER_02]: The more you take the responsibility away from the parents, the less responsibility they'll take.

194
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,284
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as you take responsibility away from the people, then they rely on others to do it for them.

195
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,686
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole process is mindless in my view.

196
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:35,315
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of the day, as long as the information is there, we should leave it to the parents and guardians, to those responsible for young people, to make informed decisions about what they should or shouldn't watch.

197
00:15:36,425 --> 00:15:45,228
[SPEAKER_02]: The blame culture in which we seem to live these days is a result of the promotion of the nanny state, no question about it.

198
00:15:45,628 --> 00:15:48,369
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always somebody else's fault and they have to have somebody else to blame.

199
00:15:49,669 --> 00:15:51,590
[SPEAKER_02]: That right there is my argument.

200
00:15:53,011 --> 00:15:54,231
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy is my hero now.

201
00:15:56,596 --> 00:15:59,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's bring down the old OLR hero wall.

202
00:15:59,638 --> 00:16:03,941
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to print out his photo at Kinko's and put it on the wall.

203
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:11,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't think it's ever been stated better than I've seen it in print there.

204
00:16:12,186 --> 00:16:21,011
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really do think that's what it comes down to, is that we have these figures in government trying to basically...

205
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,213
[SPEAKER_02]: And this, you know, it's not just here.

206
00:16:24,473 --> 00:16:25,094
[SPEAKER_02]: This is proof.

207
00:16:25,154 --> 00:16:25,895
[SPEAKER_02]: It is everywhere.

208
00:16:26,336 --> 00:16:37,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to dictate what the people see, what the people watch, take responsibility away from the people, take away accountability from the people, and put it in the hands of government to babysit them.

209
00:16:37,805 --> 00:16:38,505
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

210
00:16:39,146 --> 00:16:52,210
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been happening more, especially, and I hate to say it, especially since 9-11, it's been happening more and more, where we've had our governments taking control over what they view as protection action, whether it's in censorship of video games.

211
00:16:52,830 --> 00:17:00,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Not just that, I think more so, I mean, certainly I noticed it then too, but Janet Jackson, Boobie, Super Bowl, hello, yeah, that was a huge...

212
00:17:01,906 --> 00:17:14,376
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're seeing is, you know, especially in, and I think that's actually even more of a slap in the face to those of us in the United States where we're founded on these principles of free speech and human rights where

213
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:16,521
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

214
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:17,242
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, though, that...

215
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:53,472
[SPEAKER_02]: the whole especially with, you know, Jackie Poo his whole agenda with, you know, seeing this come up.

216
00:17:53,912 --> 00:18:04,515
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it really is more of a more of a view overall that they're not wanting us to be accountable for ourselves.

217
00:18:04,975 --> 00:18:10,036
[SPEAKER_02]: They take the power away from the people and we're left just blindly following what they tell us to.

218
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,117
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my theory behind all of this.

219
00:18:13,237 --> 00:18:13,577
[SPEAKER_02]: I think

220
00:18:13,991 --> 00:18:15,512
[SPEAKER_02]: That it all goes hand in hand.

221
00:18:16,472 --> 00:18:20,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Send those cards and letters to Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com That's just my opinion.

222
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:22,235
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just my observation.

223
00:18:22,295 --> 00:18:29,738
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, I find it very sad that governments are having to step in and tell parents how to do their jobs.

224
00:18:30,438 --> 00:18:32,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to dictate what you can and can't do.

225
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,461
[SPEAKER_02]: One more bit of European news.

226
00:18:38,141 --> 00:18:41,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the PSP Gigapack price has been slashed.

227
00:18:42,499 --> 00:18:54,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, basically, uh, for any Northern Irish gamers hoping to pick up the PSP Gigapack, um, GameStop has slashed, uh, basically, uh, 25 pounds off the price.

228
00:18:54,666 --> 00:19:01,290
[SPEAKER_02]: You can pick up the pack, which includes a PSP, a stand USB cable, and a 1 gigabyte memory stick for, uh,

229
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,096
[SPEAKER_02]: 189.99 in Northern Ireland branches of GameStop.

230
00:19:06,637 --> 00:19:12,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Game has also been lowered to 289.99 euros in GameStop stores throughout all of Ireland.

231
00:19:14,261 --> 00:19:19,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Outside, however, the price is still 214.99 or in euros 309.99.

232
00:19:22,645 --> 00:19:26,327
[SPEAKER_02]: So go to Ireland if you want to get your gigapack cheap.

233
00:19:28,508 --> 00:19:29,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, release dates.

234
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yes, what's coming up?

235
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,551
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't go without that, can we?

236
00:19:33,011 --> 00:19:34,891
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a little while, so now we're into a new month.

242
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:50,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't that make you happy?

243
00:19:51,072 --> 00:19:53,534
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been bad at watching 24.

244
00:20:11,087 --> 00:20:12,288
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't watch any TV.

245
00:20:12,488 --> 00:20:13,408
[SPEAKER_08]: Except for The Apprentice.

246
00:20:13,488 --> 00:20:15,848
[SPEAKER_08]: I watched The Apprentice once and it wasn't even that good.

249
00:20:51,229 --> 00:20:58,750
[SPEAKER_08]: WonderDog Harold would just like you all to know that watching 24 caused him to have a dream of naked Jean Smart from Designing Women who plays... Oh my god!

250
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,331
[SPEAKER_08]: She's on this new season, so... Oh my god, she still has a career?

251
00:21:02,491 --> 00:21:05,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, she actually has a great... She was the blonde one.

252
00:21:05,552 --> 00:21:06,732
[SPEAKER_08]: I only saw... Wasn't she?

253
00:21:06,752 --> 00:21:13,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I only saw the first four episodes, or the first two long episodes, the first four hours, and she had a pretty badass role, I gotta say.

254
00:21:13,513 --> 00:21:15,174
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, her career is jump-starting.

255
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:16,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, but she's not in the game.

256
00:21:16,474 --> 00:21:17,414
[SPEAKER_08]: So, anyway...

257
00:21:18,128 --> 00:21:19,709
[SPEAKER_08]: We'd love to follow up UK release dates.

258
00:21:20,249 --> 00:21:20,789
[SPEAKER_08]: That was it, right?

[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

260
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:22,649
[SPEAKER_08]: We'd love to follow up.

261
00:21:23,109 --> 00:21:28,411
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been cutting everybody off tonight with total randomness, and I apologize, but I've just been pent up for two weeks in Virginia.

262

[SPEAKER_07]: I hang my head in deep shame because I want to play this game.

275
00:22:22,058 --> 00:22:22,918
[SPEAKER_07]: More PSP games.

00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,351
[SPEAKER_07]: The Game Boy Advance.

280
00:22:41,551 --> 00:22:56,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Other notable stuff coming out later on the month here, we of course have Driver Parallel Lines coming out the week of the 13th, as well as Metal Gear Solid 3 Subsistence, which should be really sweet, The Outfit for Xbox 360.

281
00:22:57,535 --> 00:23:01,197
[SPEAKER_07]: And then finally, the week of the 20th, we've got a couple games coming out.

282
00:23:01,317 --> 00:23:12,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Most notably, The Godfather is hitting Xbox and PlayStation 2, as well as Blazing Angels is coming out on Xbox and Xbox 360.

283
00:23:12,582 --> 00:23:17,804
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, the ever-anticipated Elder Scrolls 4 finally hitting the Xbox 360.

284
00:23:17,884 --> 00:23:19,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Finally, and me and Mike Hadamari.

285
00:23:19,845 --> 00:23:20,746
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got to put that in there.

286
00:23:20,806 --> 00:23:22,887
[SPEAKER_07]: And Metroid Prime Hunters, because those are really good games as well.

287
00:23:22,907 --> 00:23:23,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Tetris DS?

288
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,482
[SPEAKER_07]: TesterDS also that week and also Metal Gear Racer 2 and Mega Man Power Rift.

289
00:23:28,522 --> 00:23:31,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my bank account is going to cry the end of this month.

290
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,703
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be a sad week at my bank.

291
00:23:33,783 --> 00:23:34,904
[SPEAKER_07]: And Worms Open Warfare.

292
00:23:34,964 --> 00:23:36,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I'm actually looking forward to that game.

293
00:23:37,664 --> 00:23:47,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, just so you know, WonderDog Harold would also like to remind you in regards to our previous conversation, Gene Smart was also the voice of Mrs. Possible in Kim Possible, just for those of you following her career.

294
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:48,968
[SPEAKER_07]: And beat me in Indiana the 29th.

295
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:49,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

296
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:51,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Which does not feature Gene Smart.

297
00:23:52,871 --> 00:23:53,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe Beatmania 2.

298
00:23:54,151 --> 00:23:56,392
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's also launched the same day as Karaoke Revolution Country.

299
00:23:57,212 --> 00:24:01,933
[SPEAKER_08]: These games that we love, Beatmania and all that stuff, and we love US games too, don't get us wrong.

300
00:24:01,953 --> 00:24:08,194
[SPEAKER_08]: We love games from all around, but Japan certainly brings us lots and lots and lots of memorable, great games.

301
00:24:08,674 --> 00:24:13,175
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a magazine over there that has a lot of clout over in the Japan gaming market.

302
00:24:13,215 --> 00:24:14,416
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called Famitsu.

303
00:24:14,956 --> 00:24:19,957
[SPEAKER_08]: They recently polled their readers to vote on their all-time favorite 100 games

304
00:24:21,337 --> 00:24:24,279
[SPEAKER_08]: Dragon Quest VII, Final Fantasy III, Tactics Ogre, Final Fantasy IV, Machi,

305
00:24:46,477 --> 00:24:47,659
[SPEAKER_08]: 4.

306
00:24:46,697 --> 00:24:47,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Dragon Quest VIII 3.

307
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:49,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Dragon Quest III 2.

308
00:24:49,661 --> 00:24:50,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy VII 1.

309
00:24:51,203 --> 00:24:51,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy X

310
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:03,833
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense because Final Fantasy X has this humongous fandom built around it.

311
00:25:04,233 --> 00:25:08,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, and that's not surprising in any way, but let me get that straight.

312
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:13,641
[SPEAKER_08]: That's four Final Fantasies and three Dragon Quests comprising the top ten.

313
00:25:13,881 --> 00:25:23,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Might I also point out Dragon Quest V, number 11, Dragon Quest IV, number 14, Dragon Quest II, number 17, Final Fantasy VIII, number 22, Final Fantasy IX, 24, Final Fantasy VI, 25.

314
00:25:23,629 --> 00:25:24,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Shall I continue?

315
00:25:27,532 --> 00:25:28,193
[SPEAKER_08]: So they like their RPGs.

316
00:25:28,213 --> 00:25:29,394
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not surprising at all.

317
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:30,214
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not.

318
00:25:30,374 --> 00:25:30,995
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really not.

319
00:25:31,235 --> 00:25:33,777
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm actually really not at all surprised to see Tactics Ogre in there.

320
00:25:33,797 --> 00:25:34,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Where was Final Fantasy Tactics?

321
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,862
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see it in the top 50.

322
00:25:39,982 --> 00:25:40,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe in the bottom 50.

323
00:25:41,143 --> 00:25:41,983
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me keep looking here.

324
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:46,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy Tactics I know had a big following for a while too.

325
00:25:46,467 --> 00:25:50,590
[SPEAKER_02]: But Tactics Ogre completely does not surprise me.

326
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:51,631
[SPEAKER_08]: 84 Final Fantasy Tactics.

327
00:25:52,131 --> 00:25:52,692
[SPEAKER_08]: It's on the list.

328
00:25:54,076 --> 00:25:56,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they have any of the PC Engine titles in there?

329
00:25:56,397 --> 00:25:57,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Dracula X?

330
00:25:58,558 --> 00:25:59,938
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I saw anything.

331
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:02,119
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

332
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:03,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Emerald Dragon?

333
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:03,999
[SPEAKER_02]: What about that?

334
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:04,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Animal Crossing's 43.

335
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,440
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

336
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,080
[SPEAKER_08]: That's something.

337
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:07,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Metal Gear Solid, 50.

338
00:26:09,481 --> 00:26:09,841
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

339
00:26:09,861 --> 00:26:11,702
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to know where Dracula X is on that.

340
00:26:11,882 --> 00:26:12,922
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's there.

341
00:26:13,022 --> 00:26:13,262
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

342
00:26:13,783 --> 00:26:14,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Gradius, 98.

343
00:26:15,737 --> 00:26:16,457
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking, I'm looking.

344
00:26:17,697 --> 00:26:22,598
[SPEAKER_08]: They published this over on next-gen.biz, by the way, is where I'm pulling this from.

345
00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:27,459
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see a single Castlevania game on here, but I'm eyeing it.

346
00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:29,080
[SPEAKER_08]: I might be missing it, so I apologize if I'm wrong there.

347
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,640
[SPEAKER_02]: That wounds me in my soul.

348
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,341
[SPEAKER_08]: So, what do you think?

349
00:26:34,121 --> 00:26:38,322
[SPEAKER_02]: They are smoking crack, but Famitsu is notorious for being bastards.

350
00:26:38,842 --> 00:26:39,842
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know...

351
00:26:40,543 --> 00:26:41,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Dragon Quest VIII Dragon Quest VIII

352
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:17,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, moving on, let's go over to Loki for some reports on the homebrew scene.

353
00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:19,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, as always.

354
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:24,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, starting off of some wonderful games coming to the PSP homebrew scene.

355
00:27:25,152 --> 00:27:27,713
[SPEAKER_07]: First one is a Halo clone.

356
00:27:27,733 --> 00:27:33,275
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, they're working on a Halo kind of port to the PSP.

357
00:27:33,376 --> 00:27:34,516
[SPEAKER_07]: It's based on the

358
00:27:35,131 --> 00:27:37,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Game or Multiplayer App Iris.

359
00:27:37,953 --> 00:27:42,997
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's actually a mod, but it's going to be containing four-player deathmatch type of gameplay.

360
00:27:43,557 --> 00:27:46,159
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of being worked on right now.

361
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:51,383
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as stuff that's out there right now, I've already mentioned this in the last podcast, but got to cover it again.

362
00:27:51,984 --> 00:28:00,530
[SPEAKER_07]: The new Super Nintendo emulator SNES 9X version 0.4 has been updated with wireless multiplayer.

363
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,532
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can actually go ahead and play...

364
00:28:03,578 --> 00:28:09,400
[SPEAKER_07]: People near you at some Street Fighter, and they've actually clocked it at 60 frames per second while playing.

365
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,720
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of cool.

366
00:28:11,581 --> 00:28:21,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Other homebrew stuff that's going to be coming out, though, for the PSP, they've created an ISO loader using the exploit in Grand Theft Auto.

367
00:28:21,984 --> 00:28:28,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Another thing that they've also been able to do is launch Grand Theft Auto on version 1.5 firmware.

368
00:28:29,146 --> 00:28:32,167
[SPEAKER_07]: And for those who have played Grand Theft Auto's Liberty City stories,

369
00:28:32,486 --> 00:28:39,412
[SPEAKER_07]: you'll know that it forces you to upgrade to 2.0 so they've actually bypassed all that and got it to run on that same firmware.

370
00:28:39,892 --> 00:29:01,570
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing that they've also launched is an upgrade to that because they're worried that people are going to be pirating games and stuff so they've actually got a UMD loader for firmware 1.5 that will run any game that will force you to update to 2.0 or higher in 1.5 if you have the UMD because a lot of people do have games out there they want to play but they want to play their homebrew stuff

371
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:02,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Now they can.

372
00:29:03,315 --> 00:29:05,476
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of cool.

373
00:29:05,556 --> 00:29:10,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Other things, there was also kind of teased a little bit for the DS.

374
00:29:13,343 --> 00:29:17,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, you can have remote access to your PC using the DS, and that was kind of cool.

375
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:21,569
[SPEAKER_07]: They showed a little picture of that, but no release on that yet.

376
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:25,052
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

377
00:29:25,112 --> 00:29:31,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep us posted on what's going on and whatever they install Linux on next and all that fun stuff.

378
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:35,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I was waiting for the 360 for Linux.

379
00:29:35,972 --> 00:29:40,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, DarkSakura, you're going to get all the fun stories tonight on violence and political stuff.

380
00:29:41,415 --> 00:29:42,136
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you got next?

381
00:29:42,536 --> 00:29:44,297
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all about the violence.

382
00:29:44,538 --> 00:29:46,519
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the politics.

383
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,800
[SPEAKER_08]: The politics, the violence.

384
00:29:50,241 --> 00:29:51,242
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all about the violence.

385
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:52,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we know.

386
00:29:52,763 --> 00:29:54,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, guess what?

387
00:29:55,027 --> 00:30:02,257
[SPEAKER_02]: With the increase of video game violence, we have crime going way down.

388
00:30:02,638 --> 00:30:03,299
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't that awesome?

389
00:30:03,339 --> 00:30:08,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, crime went down when video game violence went up?

390
00:30:09,157 --> 00:30:17,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, with the increase of the first-person shooter genre, crime... I'm sorry, I was backwards on that one.

391
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:17,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's alright.

392
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, we already went over that before.

393
00:30:20,561 --> 00:30:23,282
[SPEAKER_02]: But the crime-based action games are declining.

394
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:27,584
[SPEAKER_08]: But still, that means there's more of a demand over here than there is over there.

395
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:28,364
[SPEAKER_08]: That says something.

396
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:37,320
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically, I'm tongue-tied, excuse me.

397
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:56,033
[SPEAKER_02]: But they were basically saying that even though the success of Grand Theft Auto and all that, you know, has been so big that there's still not so many of them coming out, that the first-person shooter is really taking prevalence in the whole video game industry.

398
00:30:56,253 --> 00:30:56,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

399
00:30:58,964 --> 00:31:16,234
[SPEAKER_08]: We did have an earlier story that did state, I remember doing something on the show a while ago, that despite the violent video games coming out, people get their aggressions out on them or something, because overall, crime rate... The thing is, though, is that the study is still there, though, at the Department of Justice.

400
00:31:17,354 --> 00:31:27,160
[SPEAKER_02]: There are charts proving that since, what was it, 93, when the PlayStation came out, that there has been a decrease in youth-based violence.

401
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:28,750
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

402
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:29,712
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, two...

403
00:31:47,003 --> 00:31:48,463
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, you ready to get angsty?

404
00:31:48,483 --> 00:31:48,843
[SPEAKER_08]: When am I not?

405
00:32:25,214 --> 00:32:35,660
[SPEAKER_02]: My first, well my big only FU is I'm tired of being the emotional receptacle of the world.

406
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:43,745
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I can take, and take, and take, and take.

407
00:32:44,725 --> 00:32:50,989
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if I'm just easily ventable to, but I have my limits too.

408
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:54,191
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really an FU, it's more of an FU toward myself.

409
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:01,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because I can't... I have to get my aggression out too, damn it.

410
00:33:01,564 --> 00:33:03,845
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't see why everybody else... Let it all out, girl.

411
00:33:03,865 --> 00:33:04,265
[SPEAKER_10]: Let it all out.

412
00:33:04,325 --> 00:33:22,415
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see why everybody in the universe feels that they can just tell me their whole life story like it's some horrible thing and it's going to really, you know... Like some complete stranger starts telling me about how bad their life sucks and I'm like, okay.

413
00:33:23,696 --> 00:33:24,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you telling me this?

414
00:33:24,738 --> 00:33:25,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you tell them to stop?

415
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,159
[SPEAKER_02]: I just sort of said, I have to go now.

416
00:33:30,439 --> 00:33:47,023
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like, it's been happening more often than not lately that I've been getting rants, you know, in defense of people, you know, I never really mind hearing it, you know, if you need to vent to me, say, hey, I think you're a good person to talk to, let's talk about it.

417
00:33:47,303 --> 00:33:53,145
[SPEAKER_02]: But when it comes out, you know, completely unprovoked, I'm like, okay, what did that have to do with anything?

418
00:33:53,165 --> 00:33:54,485
[SPEAKER_02]: This is so out of left field.

419
00:33:55,123 --> 00:34:01,365
[SPEAKER_02]: and especially without, you know, even saying, hey, is this a good time for you emotionally for me to vent to?

420
00:34:03,406 --> 00:34:22,554
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to make sure that when you're going to talk to somebody that they're going to be in a position to listen to you objectively and not just... Because, you know, say that the person you're talking to is really depressed, really stressed out, really just having an awful day and then you start talking about how much your life sucks.

421
00:34:22,574 --> 00:34:23,554
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that going to make them feel?

422
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:26,837
[SPEAKER_02]: The moral of the story is get a live journal.

423
00:34:26,877 --> 00:34:27,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Vlog it.

424
00:34:27,237 --> 00:34:29,439
[SPEAKER_02]: The moral of this though is if you have a problem...

425
00:34:46,201 --> 00:34:53,948
[SPEAKER_02]: and you need to vent to somebody, make sure that your intended venting audience is in a position that they're going to be able to withstand your venting.

426
00:34:54,108 --> 00:34:59,393
[SPEAKER_03]: That's www.myspace.com That's where the internet goes to die.

427
00:34:59,453 --> 00:35:01,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Tom will be your friend when no one else will.

428
00:35:01,615 --> 00:35:02,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Just so you know.

429
00:35:03,297 --> 00:35:07,921
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm serious, so it's... I never mind listening to my friends when they need me.

430
00:35:08,301 --> 00:35:09,322
[SPEAKER_02]: I am always there.

431
00:35:09,762 --> 00:35:11,564
[SPEAKER_02]: And listeners, I am there for you.

432
00:35:12,185 --> 00:35:12,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay?

433
00:35:13,234 --> 00:35:19,779
[SPEAKER_02]: But make sure that if you are going to vent to me that I am not having the utter shit of the day before you do.

434
00:35:19,799 --> 00:35:20,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

435
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

436
00:35:24,502 --> 00:35:31,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Really the only thing I'm kind of frustrated at is Xbox Live's arcade, or not really their arcade, their online play for full auto.

437
00:35:32,327 --> 00:35:37,531
[SPEAKER_07]: The people playing full auto keep jumping out of the games like they're playing Mario Kart DS or something.

438
00:35:38,291 --> 00:36:05,756
[SPEAKER_07]: and granted you know I'm not too worried about I mean because I understand people will do that and you know I don't think that it's a huge deal but the fact is you know I'm playing the game I'm not even doing that well I'm getting like sixth place and I'm still you know taking the spot and I'm willing to you know take the sixth place and not get that many points but it doesn't even count because everyone drops out of the game and so you know I waste time you know playing through these races for nothing and also god damn it I'm doing so good in those races and I hit a damn like

439
00:36:06,351 --> 00:36:13,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Something will fly on the street like a little apple or something and my car will flip into the air like 50 feet because the physics are all fucked up.

440
00:36:14,856 --> 00:36:20,599
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really frustrating, but goddamn at least I beat those stupid gang war missions because I don't want to break something.

441
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:24,162
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

442
00:36:24,242 --> 00:36:33,167
[SPEAKER_08]: I was actually in a really crappy mood all day because PMS for men or something is what I've been going through today, but actually the show has put me in a much better mood.

443
00:36:33,809 --> 00:36:39,212
[SPEAKER_08]: So I thank you guys for having a happy, super-duper show tonight, because I'm actually in a better mood.

444
00:36:39,492 --> 00:36:42,393
[SPEAKER_08]: And I feel like throughout my randomness and my rants, I've been able to get it out.

445
00:36:42,493 --> 00:36:48,616
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess my only FU that is left is FU to the Oscars for daring to compete with our program tonight.

446
00:36:48,656 --> 00:36:50,377
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going down, Stuart.

447
00:36:51,217 --> 00:36:53,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Jon Stewart, you're going down, buddy.

448
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:54,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge, thank you.

449
00:36:55,819 --> 00:36:57,500
[SPEAKER_08]: Spike, you have any angst you need to get out?

450
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,702
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, with a name like Spike, you gotta be an angry person, right?

451
00:37:01,622 --> 00:37:03,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, actually, I have two things, and they're both

452
00:37:03,976 --> 00:37:05,437
[SPEAKER_09]: directed towards Capcom.

453
00:37:06,918 --> 00:37:15,642
[SPEAKER_09]: The first one is that as cool as I think it is that you can play as the robot masters in Mega Man Powered Up, these new character designs have to go.

454
00:37:17,023 --> 00:37:24,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Because Mega Man is not meant to be one of those Duplo Block characters, and the fact that he is, baby Jesus cries for.

455
00:37:25,808 --> 00:37:26,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Second,

456
00:37:27,557 --> 00:37:31,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Capcom is putting out a collection of their classic arcade games.

457
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,743
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a follow-up to their arcade classics line, recently launched.

458
00:37:35,563 --> 00:37:36,544
[SPEAKER_09]: The Remixed Pack.

459
00:37:37,224 --> 00:37:45,471
[SPEAKER_09]: And for some reason, in their infinite wisdom, they see fit to take up valuable space on that UMD with Quiz and Dragons.

460
00:37:47,685 --> 00:37:47,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

461
00:37:48,146 --> 00:37:49,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Quiz and Dragons is badass.

462
00:37:49,988 --> 00:37:50,649
[SPEAKER_08]: You shut up.

463
00:37:50,749 --> 00:37:52,331
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that game.

464
00:37:52,491 --> 00:37:56,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know how many quarters I wasted at the local pizzeria playing Quiz and Dragons?

465
00:37:57,056 --> 00:38:00,981
[SPEAKER_08]: And I screamed like a little girl when I found that game in MAME like years ago.

466
00:38:01,461 --> 00:38:02,442
[SPEAKER_08]: So sit down.

467
00:38:03,163 --> 00:38:03,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you serious?

468
00:38:04,024 --> 00:38:05,326
[SPEAKER_08]: I am fucking serious.

469
00:38:06,209 --> 00:38:07,530
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell is Quiz and Dragons?

470
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:08,450
[SPEAKER_08]: It was Quiz!

471
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:09,611
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a Quiz show!

472
00:38:09,631 --> 00:38:10,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Choose Quiz or Dragons!

473
00:38:11,012 --> 00:38:12,593
[SPEAKER_07]: I choose Quiz!

474
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:13,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, good, Dad.

475
00:38:13,653 --> 00:38:14,654
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a Quiz thing.

476
00:38:14,954 --> 00:38:16,535
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a Quiz thing with dragons.

477
00:38:16,555 --> 00:38:17,555
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll have the vegetarian.

478
00:38:20,237 --> 00:38:20,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

479
00:38:23,418 --> 00:38:23,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

480
00:38:24,939 --> 00:38:25,840
[SPEAKER_08]: People, alright, well.

481
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:32,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Just for the record, I want to say, even though Spike got a little angsty there, you know, Spike is actually just one of the most cuddly guys I know.

482
00:38:32,503 --> 00:38:33,204
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a nice boy.

483
00:38:35,310 --> 00:39:00,517
[SPEAKER_08]: so uh moving on he just has dragons he just has some strong opinions about very good games that Capcom put out that were horribly underrated like Black Tiger absolutely I love Black Tiger but Quiz and Dragons Loki speaking of uh dragon type things okay actually this game has nothing to do with dragons I don't know what the hell that was just just just take over wow that was an

484
00:39:02,315 --> 00:39:03,776
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to stand back for a second.

485
00:39:03,976 --> 00:39:06,318
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the most awesome transition ever.

486
00:39:06,398 --> 00:39:08,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, shut up.

487
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:08,559
[SPEAKER_08]: I told you.

488
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,160
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm having an off night tonight.

489
00:39:11,468 --> 00:39:13,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Two and a half weeks of... Forget it.

490
00:39:13,229 --> 00:39:13,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Just go.

491
00:39:14,469 --> 00:39:22,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of quizzes and dragons, Soul Calibur the movie is actually being worked on right now because you know what?

492
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:24,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently some movie studio out there is like, you know what?

493
00:39:25,355 --> 00:39:26,495
[SPEAKER_07]: We have money to burn.

494
00:39:27,095 --> 00:39:36,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's burn some money and... Yeah, anyways, they launched their website for this and it teases that the movie doesn't show anything.

495
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:39,001
[SPEAKER_07]: What, it was like a Nostradamus quote or something?

496
00:39:39,021 --> 00:39:39,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

497
00:39:40,262 --> 00:39:40,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

498
00:39:41,328 --> 00:39:42,508
[SPEAKER_08]: What is this?

499
00:39:42,568 --> 00:39:43,989
[SPEAKER_08]: www.soulcaliberofthemovie.com or something?

500
00:39:44,009 --> 00:39:54,352
[SPEAKER_07]: www.soulcaliberofthemovie.com and it loads up this wonderful strive to understand what I have found through my... Just stop.

501
00:39:54,372 --> 00:39:55,512
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not Mr. Movie Phone.

502
00:39:55,552 --> 00:39:55,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Just stop.

503
00:39:57,252 --> 00:40:01,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, so it puts up stupid little text on there.

504
00:40:01,093 --> 00:40:02,374
[SPEAKER_07]: And not a single picture of Ivy.

505
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:05,294
[SPEAKER_07]: And this sword shall smite the earth.

506
00:40:05,495 --> 00:40:06,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

507
00:40:06,595 --> 00:40:06,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Look.

508
00:40:07,848 --> 00:40:09,729
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was bullshit when I first looked at it.

509
00:40:09,749 --> 00:40:11,130
[SPEAKER_08]: I said, ah, fan thing, bullshit.

510
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:13,851
[SPEAKER_08]: But I was like, okay, maybe there's something going on here.

511
00:40:13,871 --> 00:40:27,919
[SPEAKER_08]: So I put on my Google hat, and I went over to Google, and I started searching all around, and sure enough, I found this page on backstage.com, and it shows films that are currently in development, in the early development process, and sure enough, there it is.

512
00:40:28,299 --> 00:40:30,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Soul Calibur the movie, action.

513
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at this, Romania, China, and Canada.

514
00:40:32,861 --> 00:40:34,262
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that's where they're going to be filming this.

515
00:40:34,782 --> 00:40:36,444
[SPEAKER_08]: VJP Agarwal Canada Almost Resembles Romania

516
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:54,606
[SPEAKER_08]: and China.

517
00:40:54,786 --> 00:41:00,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's just like the Oscars are on tonight, the big movie tonight, Brokeback Mountain.

518
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:03,293
[SPEAKER_08]: If it weren't for all the French people and snow.

519
00:41:03,513 --> 00:41:03,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, hold on.

520
00:41:03,973 --> 00:41:06,556
[SPEAKER_08]: But they're saying Brokeback Mountain is driving all this tourism to Wyoming.

521
00:41:06,796 --> 00:41:07,817
[SPEAKER_08]: It was filmed in Canada.

522
00:41:10,419 --> 00:41:12,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is, you know, amazing.

523
00:41:12,941 --> 00:41:14,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, let's see.

524
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:15,463
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still trying to find this guy.

525
00:41:15,483 --> 00:41:16,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's figure out what else he was affiliated with.

526
00:41:16,924 --> 00:41:18,866
[SPEAKER_08]: The executive producer there.

527
00:41:19,827 --> 00:41:21,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Such wonderful films as...

528
00:41:24,229 --> 00:41:25,609
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if this is the same one here.

529
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:27,370
[SPEAKER_08]: That can't be the same one.

530
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:28,270
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

531
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:28,810
[SPEAKER_08]: More to come.

532
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:29,171
[SPEAKER_08]: More to come.

533
00:41:29,191 --> 00:41:30,551
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll do research and get back to you guys.

534
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:31,411
[SPEAKER_08]: He hasn't made Jack.

535
00:41:31,751 --> 00:41:34,452
[SPEAKER_08]: For now, let's go back to a story about Electronic Arts.

536
00:41:35,012 --> 00:41:37,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, they make a lot of their money off those NFL games, right?

537
00:41:38,794 --> 00:41:44,555
[SPEAKER_08]: The NFL and the Players Association are currently involved in a debate over salaries and players' cuts, etc., etc.

538
00:41:45,516 --> 00:41:50,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless they get to an agreement, they're going to maybe go on strike and maybe there'll be a lockout in 2008.

539
00:41:50,597 --> 00:41:50,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

540
00:41:54,091 --> 00:42:05,915
[SPEAKER_08]: If there is some antitrust that goes in here, if the antitrust rules go into play with this whole strike or whatever, it would void Electronic Arts' contract with the NFL.

541
00:42:06,395 --> 00:42:09,196
[SPEAKER_08]: And that would really suck for EA if that happened.

542
00:42:09,796 --> 00:42:10,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Ubern.

543
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:11,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Poor babies.

544
00:42:11,716 --> 00:42:12,997
[SPEAKER_08]: So they better hope there's no strike.

545
00:42:13,017 --> 00:42:13,917
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't deserve that.

546
00:42:14,437 --> 00:42:16,038
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

547
00:42:16,838 --> 00:42:19,419
[SPEAKER_08]: I know a lot of you guys that listen to this program probably don't play those games.

548
00:42:19,439 --> 00:42:20,819
[SPEAKER_08]: But for those that do, there you go.

549
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, what else you got?

550
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,080
[SPEAKER_02]: My husband does.

551
00:42:24,193 --> 00:42:31,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, a couple weeks ago, there was this wonderful little arcade show in Japan where they showed off some really cool stuff.

552
00:42:31,456 --> 00:42:31,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that's right.

553
00:42:32,837 --> 00:42:37,779
[SPEAKER_07]: AOU 2006, they had a couple wonderful highlights here we're going to cover.

554
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:41,821
[SPEAKER_07]: The first one being Time Crisis 4, because, you know, Time Crisis rocks.

555
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:47,643
[SPEAKER_07]: And Soul Calibur 3 is finally making its way to the arcade, as well as some other games.

556
00:42:47,663 --> 00:42:51,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Taiko no Tatsujin coming out now with Super Mario Bros.

557
00:42:51,705 --> 00:42:53,546
[SPEAKER_07]: songs, so that should be pretty cool.

558
00:42:54,915 --> 00:43:05,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Other things, of course, Half-Life 2 Survivor, which is going to be the arcade version of Half-Life 2, kind of with a lot of Deathmatch stuff there.

559
00:43:07,095 --> 00:43:07,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see here.

560
00:43:08,763 --> 00:43:30,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, some stuff from Sega, Virtual Fighter 5, which looks pretty cool, and House of the Dead 4, which is really neat, better graphics of course, and they even have a version that's kind of one of those, you know, arcade ride simulator type of things, with a 100 inch screen, and it actually, you know, they strap you in and it rotates around and kind of coincides with the movie.

561
00:43:32,622 --> 00:43:43,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, other things, of course, would be Virtual Strikers 4, you know, for your soccer fans, and some new brain training game.

562
00:43:44,504 --> 00:43:46,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm, interesting.

563
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:48,825
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah.

564
00:43:48,865 --> 00:43:55,946
[SPEAKER_09]: Something of note for those of you local here to the Sacramento area, the movie theater over in Roseville currently has a test machine of House of the Dead 4.

565
00:43:57,646 --> 00:44:00,107
[SPEAKER_09]: I was there last night, it was rather impressive.

566
00:44:00,147 --> 00:44:01,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it still have the awful voice acting?

567
00:44:02,677 --> 00:44:02,937
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes!

568
00:44:03,237 --> 00:44:03,777
Yay!

569
00:44:04,017 --> 00:44:09,999
[SPEAKER_09]: And that Lindbergh board is putting out some textures that amazed the hell out of me.

570
00:44:10,039 --> 00:44:10,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Really.

571
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:13,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome 3D and bad voice acting.

572
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,241
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to go spill coke on that machine.

573
00:44:18,421 --> 00:44:20,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Wake me when Typing of the Dead 2 comes out.

574
00:44:21,422 --> 00:44:22,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, I love Typing of the Dead.

575
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:23,223
[SPEAKER_08]: I do too.

576
00:44:23,283 --> 00:44:26,944
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I'm not... I want to do a cosplay where I strap a Dreamcast to my back.

577
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:27,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Been done.

578
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:28,164
[SPEAKER_07]: People have done that.

579
00:44:28,524 --> 00:44:29,204
[SPEAKER_02]: People have done it.

580
00:44:29,544 --> 00:44:30,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, now.

581
00:44:30,045 --> 00:44:30,865
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes me happy.

582
00:44:31,045 --> 00:44:31,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob...

583
00:44:32,298 --> 00:44:37,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Microsoft could be working on that next if this whole, you know, DDR email thing falls through.

584
00:44:38,363 --> 00:44:38,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.

585
00:44:38,643 --> 00:44:39,064
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

586
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:41,926
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what that whole typing of the dead setup reminds me of?

587
00:44:42,487 --> 00:44:43,107
[SPEAKER_08]: The origami.

588
00:44:47,833 --> 00:44:48,233
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

589
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,821
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a bajillion emails in the last couple weeks.

590
00:45:18,881 --> 00:45:21,063
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tried to reply to as many as I can.

591
00:45:21,263 --> 00:45:25,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I have been sort of pooped on by school, so sorry.

592
00:45:26,606 --> 00:45:29,127
[SPEAKER_02]: As in, I'm sort of skipping class tomorrow to finish my homework.

593
00:45:29,167 --> 00:45:30,568
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, back to the mailbag.

594
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:33,069
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm such a responsible student, aren't I?

595
00:45:33,709 --> 00:45:38,992
[SPEAKER_02]: We got an email from... Robert sent us an email.

596
00:45:39,893 --> 00:45:41,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Who had a question about Guitar Hero.

597
00:45:43,917 --> 00:45:47,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any talk about Guitar Hero being made for Japan?

598
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:55,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, Red Octane is, as far as I know, an American publisher, unlike Konami, who did the Karaoke Revolution series overseas as well as domestically.

599
00:45:56,127 --> 00:45:59,029
[SPEAKER_02]: And the current song selections are very US and European.

600
00:45:59,409 --> 00:46:02,832
[SPEAKER_02]: But do you see the game competing well with Guitar Freaks?

601
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:17,377
[SPEAKER_08]: I think most Bomani fans in general, and I'm making a broad generalization, of course there are exceptions to this, I think most of the community prefers Guitar Hero over Guitar Freaks because Guitar Hero kind of improved on the Guitar Freaks model.

602
00:46:17,437 --> 00:46:19,099
[SPEAKER_08]: So could the game do well in Japan?

603
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:21,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.

604
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:25,583
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they'd obviously have to change the song list, but go ahead.

605
00:46:26,623 --> 00:46:34,188
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Guitar Hero would have the potential to do well in Japan, but the thing is you have to really focus on how the Japanese gaming market does.

606
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:38,240
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to stick more with the Bimani series, I'm sorry.

607
00:46:40,141 --> 00:46:42,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Namco has a guitar series out.

608
00:46:43,823 --> 00:46:51,467
[SPEAKER_02]: A few other companies have various other ones, and still the most popular of them are still the Bimani ones, even if the other ones are better.

609
00:46:52,388 --> 00:47:04,274
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the most likely thing to happen, if it were to happen in Japan, and please understand this is pure speculation, I think Harmonix would probably license that out to someone else to develop a Japanese version.

610
00:47:05,224 --> 00:47:08,565
[SPEAKER_08]: or maybe, you know, like, I don't think it would be that same Red Octane Harmonix.

611
00:47:08,605 --> 00:47:12,886
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they would sell out the license, the idea, to somebody who's interested in localizing it for Japan.

612
00:47:12,906 --> 00:47:13,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the game engine.

613
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:14,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

614
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:15,587
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, who knows?

615
00:47:15,827 --> 00:47:17,747
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that seems most likely to me.

616
00:47:18,167 --> 00:47:19,647
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't see anything happening this year.

617
00:47:19,948 --> 00:47:22,848
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to see, like, Guitar Hero Visual K Edition.

618
00:47:23,288 --> 00:47:26,629
[SPEAKER_08]: But what's interesting is that, you know, Guitar Freaks V is still supposedly on its way.

619
00:47:26,649 --> 00:47:30,190
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't heard anything in a while, but supposedly it's still coming in Japan, so...

620
00:47:31,128 --> 00:47:39,431
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be interesting if Guitar Hero were to come out to counter this, but would Konami get lawsuit-y over it?

621
00:47:39,511 --> 00:47:41,671
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

622
00:47:42,011 --> 00:47:43,672
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a whole other can of worms there.

623
00:47:43,712 --> 00:47:44,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

624
00:47:44,452 --> 00:47:46,813
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all speculation.

625
00:47:47,113 --> 00:47:49,794
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have an email from our friend Rob with two Bs.

626
00:47:50,494 --> 00:47:51,414
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a lot of Robs tonight.

627
00:47:51,434 --> 00:47:53,455
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a good mailbag night.

628
00:47:54,582 --> 00:47:56,423
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked about this last week, I might add.

629
00:47:57,424 --> 00:47:57,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

630
00:47:57,544 --> 00:47:58,084
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying.

631
00:47:58,104 --> 00:48:00,365
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm reading the email, which has nothing to do with last week.

632
00:48:23,277 --> 00:48:41,845
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically the Sierra game titles are being re-released from Target.com So just go ahead and check out Target.com, their whole series of them Police Quest, Space Quest, King's Quest Which will explain why they didn't get added to GameTap Oh no, Space Quest is on GameTap So I kind of was hoping King's Quest would make its way Anyway

633
00:48:43,541 --> 00:49:01,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Also an email from Justin, who I helped with the song title, said he saw the Lemmings game for PSP out and released in the UK and wondering if it was way too important and if it would even play on the US PSP.

634
00:49:01,088 --> 00:49:03,929
[SPEAKER_02]: The answer to that is no, I don't think, because aren't they...

635
00:49:04,557 --> 00:49:05,578
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if they're region encoded.

636
00:49:05,598 --> 00:49:06,219
[SPEAKER_01]: PSPs aren't.

637
00:49:06,479 --> 00:49:07,039
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they're not.

638
00:49:07,099 --> 00:49:09,922
[SPEAKER_02]: So actually, yeah, you would be able to play it.

639
00:49:11,223 --> 00:49:13,465
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just say, you know, check Amazon.

640
00:49:13,525 --> 00:49:16,268
[SPEAKER_02]: I order from Amazon UK all the time.

641
00:49:16,688 --> 00:49:23,535
[SPEAKER_08]: The reason why it's easier to do this with handhelds where you can cross import and all that stuff and like, you know, Game Boy Advance games work, Japan, US, doesn't matter.

642
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:25,936
[SPEAKER_08]: is because the handhelds have their own screens.

643
00:49:26,017 --> 00:49:31,940
[SPEAKER_08]: The biggest problem you run into with the UK versus the US... Anything on TV is going to be PAL versus NTSC.

644
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:32,421
[SPEAKER_08]: You got it.

645
00:49:32,501 --> 00:49:35,343
[SPEAKER_08]: And until everybody's on high def, we're always going to have this problem.

646
00:49:36,063 --> 00:49:41,527
[SPEAKER_02]: However, if you've got a high definition screen and the imported system, you will not run into a problem.

647
00:49:43,052 --> 00:49:47,756
[SPEAKER_09]: One thing of note on importing UMDs is that UMD movies are always region coded.

648
00:49:48,577 --> 00:49:50,358
[SPEAKER_09]: So, just as a general rule.

649
00:49:50,438 --> 00:49:55,122
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what had me thinking because I knew the movies were, I didn't know what the games were, but yeah.

650
00:49:55,322 --> 00:49:58,445
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, you should have, I suggest, honestly suggest Amazon.

651
00:49:58,525 --> 00:50:03,809
[SPEAKER_02]: I order CDs through Amazon UK and Japanese Amazon all the time.

652
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:08,313
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I'm going to be paying $30 for a Gorillaz single in a couple of weeks.

653
00:50:08,734 --> 00:50:09,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Freak.

654
00:50:09,454 --> 00:50:10,095
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you.

655
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, hey.

656
00:50:15,203 --> 00:50:15,964
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't say it on the air.

657
00:50:16,004 --> 00:50:17,446
[SPEAKER_08]: We did not bring you here to be a fanboy.

658
00:50:17,466 --> 00:50:18,107
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just kidding.

659
00:50:19,029 --> 00:50:19,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Fanboy away.

660
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:19,930
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fine.

661
00:50:20,331 --> 00:50:21,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Jaime emailed us.

662
00:50:21,974 --> 00:50:23,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember the Jaime, not me?

663
00:50:23,997 --> 00:50:25,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I do remember this.

664
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,204
[SPEAKER_08]: She told us about the Darwinia?

665
00:50:28,786 --> 00:50:29,847
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

666
00:50:47,228 --> 00:50:51,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Though it needed good games, the golden rule of video game systems.

667
00:50:52,092 --> 00:50:56,156
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys were pretty accurate on that show, if I remember correctly, on your predictions for that system.

668
00:50:56,496 --> 00:51:01,641
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking about a best of show because I still have every show since you guys have been on iTunes.

669
00:51:02,061 --> 00:51:05,324
[SPEAKER_02]: And I still love to listen to some of them for a good laugh.

670
00:51:05,484 --> 00:51:05,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

671
00:51:07,566 --> 00:51:08,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Some good ones.

672
00:51:08,547 --> 00:51:09,648
[SPEAKER_02]: OLR Week of...

673
00:51:10,789 --> 00:51:17,957
[SPEAKER_02]: 8105 to 8705 with Matt, listen, I guess this is a Matt quote, Loki quote, sorry.

674
00:51:18,818 --> 00:51:23,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, I'm not knocking the Mac or anything because granted the processing power may be what I'm looking for.

675
00:51:23,543 --> 00:51:24,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Their cases look cool though.

676
00:51:26,487 --> 00:51:27,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, their cases are nice.

677
00:51:28,996 --> 00:51:35,318
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, Rob, did we just go to Bizarro Orange Challenge Radio because I just heard Loki say something nice about the Macintosh?

678
00:51:38,198 --> 00:51:44,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and then you said, the cases look nice, but that's all they are, just big graphing calculators inside of a nice case.

679
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:46,780
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember him saying that.

680
00:51:47,241 --> 00:51:49,121
[SPEAKER_02]: And then bringing out the Mega Man 2 sound.

681
00:51:50,729 --> 00:51:51,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's right.

682
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:51,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, yeah.

683
00:51:52,511 --> 00:51:52,811
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

684
00:51:52,851 --> 00:51:54,372
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some funny bits in the old stuff.

685
00:51:55,272 --> 00:52:02,597
[SPEAKER_08]: You can dig 20 episodes back at olrpsp.com.

686
00:52:02,617 --> 00:52:02,857
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

687
00:52:03,958 --> 00:52:05,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, these are great!

688
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:08,601
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll take you back to about...

689
00:52:09,904 --> 00:52:13,888
[SPEAKER_08]: November shows, but the other old stuff, you're going to have to wait until we put out a CD.

690
00:52:13,928 --> 00:52:16,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't we have that wiki quote page or something?

691
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:17,171
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a wiki quote page somewhere.

692
00:52:17,191 --> 00:52:19,833
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to put these up on wiki quote, because these are hilarious.

693
00:52:19,873 --> 00:52:23,617
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one about the final thought that you did.

694
00:52:24,097 --> 00:52:24,317
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

695
00:52:24,838 --> 00:52:35,488
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, we were talking about Pizza Man, and then you said, no, I said, Al, your table got GTA on my elbow.

696
00:52:37,213 --> 00:52:40,754
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you said that she got beat up by Pizza Man.

697
00:52:41,674 --> 00:52:42,394
[SPEAKER_08]: And I probably played that.

698
00:52:42,414 --> 00:52:43,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I remember that show.

699
00:52:43,254 --> 00:52:44,875
[SPEAKER_02]: And you played the Mega Man theme.

700
00:52:45,515 --> 00:52:45,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Check it out.

701
00:52:45,915 --> 00:52:46,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Retro.

702
00:52:46,595 --> 00:52:49,815
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's winning more of our older, older, older shows.

703
00:52:50,295 --> 00:52:52,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, oh my god, the older shows.

704
00:52:52,976 --> 00:52:58,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, if you listen to episode one of our original live show, where Loki was talking in a tin can.

705
00:52:58,657 --> 00:53:03,618
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my horrible quote show, was the very first show when I talked about the King of Iron Fingering.

706
00:53:04,578 --> 00:53:06,779
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if that was the first, but it was in the beginning.

707
00:53:06,799 --> 00:53:07,199
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the first.

708
00:53:07,279 --> 00:53:10,301
[SPEAKER_02]: I left the show with such a migraine because I was using that headset.

709
00:53:10,321 --> 00:53:10,701
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

710
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:12,201
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?

711
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:17,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Those quotes that you put up, dude, you would be our hero if you put them up on a wiki quote.

712
00:53:17,144 --> 00:53:18,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Or just put them on the forums.

713
00:53:18,824 --> 00:53:20,205
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a quote thread on our forums.

714
00:53:20,225 --> 00:53:21,165
[SPEAKER_02]: You should totally put them up there.

715
00:53:21,185 --> 00:53:21,525
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

716
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:23,146
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't necessarily have to be the IRC.

717
00:53:23,586 --> 00:53:25,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, start a new thread on there.

718
00:53:25,407 --> 00:53:26,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Show quotes thread.

719
00:53:26,648 --> 00:53:27,008
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

720
00:53:28,989 --> 00:53:29,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

721
00:53:29,609 --> 00:53:30,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other mails?

722
00:53:30,229 --> 00:53:30,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we have a couple more, right?

723
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:31,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Two more.

724
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:31,870
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's...

725
00:53:33,631 --> 00:53:35,452
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from Sakarina.

726
00:53:36,173 --> 00:53:38,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi Sakarina, one of our big ol' regulars.

727
00:53:38,775 --> 00:53:41,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi buddy, one of our Canadian listeners.

728
00:53:41,717 --> 00:53:54,126
[SPEAKER_02]: According to posters on DSMeet, actually it's dsmeet.com slash t slash 3463, UK game retailer chain GAME is selling a third-party headset for the DS.

729
00:53:54,707 --> 00:54:02,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently the headset works with mic-enabled games such as Nintendogs, and mic quality is much better than the one built in the DS.

730
00:54:03,647 --> 00:54:11,632
[SPEAKER_02]: I think UK gamers might want to pick one of these up once Metroid Prime Hunters hits the streets in May for Europeans and March for North American gamers.

731
00:54:13,313 --> 00:54:16,915
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the thing I always hated about Xbox Live.

732
00:54:17,375 --> 00:54:23,119
[SPEAKER_07]: People would be talking during full auto and stuff and I can't understand anything because I can't hear the sound effects and music.

733
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,761
[SPEAKER_07]: And if only they had better mics or weren't stupid.

734
00:54:28,002 --> 00:54:29,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Not being stupid does help.

735
00:54:30,612 --> 00:54:34,886
[SPEAKER_02]: We also, the last email comes from Ace Man in Calgary.

736
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:37,330
[SPEAKER_02]: I like our Canadian listeners.

737
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:37,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

738
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:38,790
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Canada.

739
00:54:39,431 --> 00:54:41,712
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually, I am probably taking a trip to Canada.

740
00:54:41,732 --> 00:54:42,312
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what's funny?

741
00:54:42,433 --> 00:54:45,094
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm planning on celebrating, I'm taking a vacation.

742
00:54:45,154 --> 00:54:46,395
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a me trip, not a work trip.

743
00:54:46,615 --> 00:54:47,776
[SPEAKER_08]: The last couple weeks was a work trip.

744
00:54:48,036 --> 00:54:49,096
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to be taking a me trip.

745
00:54:49,156 --> 00:54:50,917
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to celebrate 4th of July in Canada.

746
00:54:51,458 --> 00:54:52,078
[SPEAKER_08]: That's hilarious.

747
00:54:52,098 --> 00:54:54,880
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to Canada voluntarily?

748
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:55,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

749
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:56,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up.

750
00:54:56,641 --> 00:54:57,921
[SPEAKER_08]: I love Vancouver.

751
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,062
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to go to Vancouver.

752
00:54:59,082 --> 00:55:00,122
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably where I'm going.

753
00:55:00,223 --> 00:55:02,284
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never ever left the United States.

754
00:55:03,164 --> 00:55:07,865
[SPEAKER_02]: and it looks like my trip to London next year is getting pushed back again due to money.

755
00:55:08,545 --> 00:55:11,506
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really want to go to Canada.

756
00:55:11,526 --> 00:55:16,146
[SPEAKER_08]: We're definitely thinking about doing a 4th of July in Canada just to be ironic.

757
00:55:16,266 --> 00:55:16,827
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be hilarious.

758
00:55:16,847 --> 00:55:17,567
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it would be fun.

759
00:55:18,127 --> 00:55:18,447
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

760
00:55:19,047 --> 00:55:19,807
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll let you know.

761
00:55:20,167 --> 00:55:30,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, there's a link sent to us by Aceman about Yui Bull deciding to not do any more video game movies.

762
00:55:30,822 --> 00:55:31,963
[SPEAKER_09]: and there was much rejoicing.

763
00:55:32,083 --> 00:55:32,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

764
00:55:34,464 --> 00:55:39,367
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually it's a relink to a Eurogamer article about Yui Bull basically.

765
00:55:40,908 --> 00:55:47,692
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a whole interview up there and I'll see if I can't find the link to post in our chat room and maybe repost on our website.

766
00:55:48,952 --> 00:55:56,517
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically there's a regarding the feedback that he's received from gamers to quote

767
00:55:57,108 --> 00:56:01,311
[SPEAKER_02]: The dangerous thing right now is that a lot of people bash me without thinking about the movies.

768
00:56:01,411 --> 00:56:04,774
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fashionable to hit on you, Abel, and this is what I don't get.

769
00:56:05,594 --> 00:56:08,617
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't get why this comes so harshly from the game press.

770
00:56:11,719 --> 00:56:12,760
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another quote on here.

771
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:18,324
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't say I won't acquire another video game license in the future, but I'm not so eager to do it anymore, to be honest.

772
00:56:18,832 --> 00:56:23,695
[SPEAKER_02]: After Far Cry, maybe I'll go away from video game based movies and everybody can be really happy about it.

773
00:56:24,135 --> 00:56:25,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we will!

774
00:56:25,717 --> 00:56:27,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we supposed to be sympathetic because I'm not?

775
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:29,359
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not at all.

776
00:56:29,859 --> 00:56:36,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, he just, you know, I actually clicked on the Eurogamer article.

777
00:56:36,083 --> 00:56:36,804
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Eurogamer.

778
00:56:36,844 --> 00:56:37,764
[SPEAKER_02]: They have some of the best stuff.

779
00:56:38,205 --> 00:56:48,051
[SPEAKER_02]: But another quote on here says, If people don't see that, then it's not my problem, but I think that those people who hate me or want to bash me, normal people, people who buy movies or watch TV, they see that absolutely.

780
00:56:49,013 --> 00:56:49,553
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

781
00:56:50,794 --> 00:56:53,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you just actually pay attention to what the gamers are telling you?

782
00:56:54,457 --> 00:56:58,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Take it as feedback like any real professional would.

783
00:56:58,180 --> 00:56:58,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello?

784
00:56:59,181 --> 00:57:06,466
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually follow that feedback and put out a quality product instead of taking your own stupid little take on it because you're just screwing it up.

785
00:57:07,207 --> 00:57:08,988
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why people are bashing you.

786
00:57:09,028 --> 00:57:13,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe if people are bashing you, it's because there's a reason they're doing it.

787
00:57:13,877 --> 00:57:18,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Not necessarily because, you know, I'm sure one or two people out there are just doing it to be buttheads.

788
00:57:18,941 --> 00:57:23,825
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, if you're getting it from the community as a whole... The world, essentially.

789
00:57:24,606 --> 00:57:27,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm focusing on the gaming community.

790
00:57:27,328 --> 00:57:32,873
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're getting this feedback from the gaming community as a whole, why not listen?

791
00:57:33,614 --> 00:57:41,080
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're taking a series that we all, at least chunks of us, love and making a travesty of it

792
00:57:42,281 --> 00:57:44,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not do what they're doing with Silent Hill?

793
00:57:44,762 --> 00:57:46,703
[SPEAKER_02]: They're freaking working with Konami on this.

794
00:57:47,024 --> 00:57:48,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's what he has to understand.

795
00:57:48,384 --> 00:57:56,468
[SPEAKER_07]: He doesn't get it because he's getting all this people saying that the movie sucks, but he's selling millions and millions of copies on DVD or whatever.

796
00:57:57,308 --> 00:57:59,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's my analogy to the whole thing.

797
00:57:59,629 --> 00:58:05,412
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm under the assumption dog crap probably tastes like dog crap.

798
00:58:05,552 --> 00:58:06,893
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably not very good.

799
00:58:07,665 --> 00:58:12,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, we know it's bad, but I'm not going to know how bad until I actually chew on a piece of dog crap.

800
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:15,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Same goes with Uebowl's movies.

801
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:20,073
[SPEAKER_07]: I know they're bad, but I'm not going to subject myself to them to know how bad they really are.

802
00:58:20,373 --> 00:58:22,935
[SPEAKER_07]: I just know that they're so awful that I'm not going to watch them.

803
00:58:24,376 --> 00:58:25,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Worst analogy ever.

804
00:58:27,438 --> 00:58:30,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I think the dog crap one is fairly relevant.

805
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:30,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Fine.

806
00:58:34,164 --> 00:58:37,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Send us some love.

807
00:58:37,366 --> 00:58:38,227
[SPEAKER_08]: We love to get emails.

808
00:58:39,288 --> 00:58:41,569
[SPEAKER_08]: More interaction to come a little later here in the program.

809
00:58:41,589 --> 00:58:42,930
[SPEAKER_08]: But first, a couple more stories.

810
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:48,814
[SPEAKER_08]: We are going to open Skype line very, very, very soon, but not until we get to a story from Loki about Windows.

811
00:58:49,895 --> 00:58:50,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Go Windows.

812
00:58:51,456 --> 00:58:53,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Windows will be enhanced with Origami.

813
00:58:54,418 --> 00:58:57,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Windows Vista is going to have a gamer enhanced version.

814
00:58:58,041 --> 00:58:58,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that's right.

815
00:59:00,002 --> 00:59:01,043
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to actually have

816
00:59:01,929 --> 00:59:02,149
[SPEAKER_07]: and so on.

817
00:59:24,147 --> 00:59:24,468
[SPEAKER_07]: and so on.

818
00:59:41,193 --> 00:59:42,514
[SPEAKER_08]: GameSummerCamp.com

819
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:11,271
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura Do I?

820
01:00:11,351 --> 01:00:11,791
[SPEAKER_08]: I forgot.

821
01:00:35,174 --> 01:00:36,395
[SPEAKER_02]: No, actually, I know what it is.

822
01:00:37,476 --> 01:00:42,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft is going to start releasing a $10 best of type deal.

823
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that cool?

824
01:00:44,721 --> 01:00:46,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Best of Platinum Hits is what they're called.

825
01:00:46,783 --> 01:00:47,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, the best of the best.

826
01:00:48,003 --> 01:00:48,484
[SPEAKER_08]: What games?

827
01:00:48,664 --> 01:00:49,805
[SPEAKER_08]: $10 isn't bad.

828
01:00:50,225 --> 01:00:54,568
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there good stuff in there, or am I going to be subjected to Barbie, Paradise, whatever?

829
01:00:54,588 --> 01:00:56,249
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some good stuff in here.

830
01:00:56,269 --> 01:01:01,273
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of Tom Clancy stuff, like almost all the old ones, like Ghost Recon, blah, blah, blah.

831
01:01:01,293 --> 01:01:02,354
[SPEAKER_02]: The first Ghost Recon.

832
01:01:03,397 --> 01:01:25,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Tony Hawk's Underground, Pro Skater 4, True Crime Streets of LA, Counter Strike, Elder Scrolls 3, Enter the Matrix, that's a pretty decent one, Fusion Frenzy, Mech Assault, Project Gotham 2, Shrek 2, and the one that makes me happy is Soul Calibur 2, which I already own on several systems, but still, Soul Calibur 2, which is really cool.

833
01:01:26,052 --> 01:01:26,472
[SPEAKER_08]: That's good.

834
01:01:26,532 --> 01:01:29,073
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like one of those things like, just buy it already if you don't have it.

835
01:01:29,253 --> 01:01:36,175
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if they were going to show a lot of love for the listeners, they would actually put out, you know, recreate the Dreamcast fishing controller so that we could do Rod Caliber.

836
01:01:36,295 --> 01:01:36,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, stop it.

837
01:01:38,296 --> 01:01:39,376
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I can't.

838
01:01:39,777 --> 01:01:41,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of our listeners may not have heard this.

839
01:01:41,777 --> 01:01:48,339
[SPEAKER_02]: On the Dreamcast for Soul Caliber, you can take the fishing rod and play Soul Caliber with the fishing rod controller, a.k.a.

840
01:01:48,459 --> 01:01:49,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Rod Caliber.

841
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:51,861
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

842
01:01:51,941 --> 01:01:52,161
[SPEAKER_08]: We are...

843
01:01:55,689 --> 01:02:03,331
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to go to the Skype line and we're going to pick up some calls here over on the Skype line.

844
01:02:04,371 --> 01:02:11,273
[SPEAKER_08]: www.orangelongerator.com Click on chat with us or interact with us and you can call us on Skype.

845
01:02:11,293 --> 01:02:23,796
[SPEAKER_08]: You can also pick up the phone and call us 916-226-9067 but please make sure you ask whoever owns the phone line first if you can call because this is a toll call unless you happen to live

846
01:02:24,232 --> 01:02:25,292
[SPEAKER_08]: in Sacramento, California.

847
01:02:25,352 --> 01:02:26,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to the line and pick up a call.

848
01:02:27,333 --> 01:02:28,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

849
01:02:29,353 --> 01:02:30,493
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy crap, I made it on.

850
01:02:30,753 --> 01:02:31,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, who's this?

851
01:02:31,673 --> 01:02:32,814
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Ranma.

852
01:02:32,854 --> 01:02:33,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Who else would it be?

853
01:02:33,694 --> 01:02:34,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Ranma.

854
01:02:34,434 --> 01:02:35,014
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you?

855
01:02:35,714 --> 01:02:36,454
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm good.

856
01:02:36,574 --> 01:02:38,394
[SPEAKER_08]: This was my buddy at KatsuCon.

857
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:44,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Ranma's the reason I went to KatsuCon and put up with six people at my panel.

858
01:02:45,256 --> 01:02:46,416
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it was great, though.

859
01:02:46,716 --> 01:02:50,277
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a good experience, and I did a lot of networking, which was really good.

860
01:02:51,677 --> 01:02:52,557
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a good time.

861
01:02:53,203 --> 01:02:53,804
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta come back for 13.

862
01:02:53,844 --> 01:02:55,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Thinking about it.

863
01:02:55,585 --> 01:02:58,308
[SPEAKER_08]: I already told you my D.Va line.

864
01:02:58,588 --> 01:03:00,490
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll only do it if my panel's at a certain time.

865
01:03:01,871 --> 01:03:02,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I'll help you out with that.

866
01:03:03,032 --> 01:03:03,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, sounds good.

867
01:03:05,244 --> 01:03:10,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I just want you to know the gifts that you sent along, I just handed out before the show.

868
01:03:11,586 --> 01:03:19,189
[SPEAKER_08]: We have our matching Mario hats as like a present, a late Christmas present, I guess, to Orange Lounge, or just a present for no real reason.

869
01:03:19,669 --> 01:03:32,473
[SPEAKER_08]: We got little Mario hats, and I have an S for Sky, a red hat, and then DarkSakura has a pink hat for Princess, DS DarkSakura, and then Loki has an L for, not Luigi, but Loki, and a green hat, and it's really cool.

870
01:03:32,853 --> 01:03:33,613
[SPEAKER_08]: So we love the hats.

871
01:03:33,653 --> 01:03:33,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

872
01:03:34,605 --> 01:03:35,566
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so glad you liked them.

873
01:03:36,566 --> 01:03:37,707
[SPEAKER_08]: What else is on your mind, buddy?

874
01:03:38,827 --> 01:03:39,248
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much.

875
01:03:39,288 --> 01:03:42,309
[SPEAKER_01]: I just came back from playing a couple of rounds of Drunken DDR this weekend.

876
01:03:42,789 --> 01:03:43,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Hot.

877
01:03:43,370 --> 01:03:43,930
[SPEAKER_08]: How'd that go?

878
01:03:46,131 --> 01:03:51,234
[SPEAKER_01]: The drinks weren't as strong as I thought they were, so I really couldn't get drunk per se.

879
01:03:52,048 --> 01:04:00,998
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the only time I ever really played drunk DDR was in Vegas, and I still got, like, this is when DDR was still new, and you would always get a crowd every time you played.

880
01:04:01,398 --> 01:04:05,723
[SPEAKER_08]: And you should have seen the crowd I got playing DDR while drunk.

881
01:04:05,743 --> 01:04:09,867
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just remember, like, when you would do jumps, very heavy the jumps felt.

882
01:04:10,387 --> 01:04:11,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Very heavy.

883
01:04:11,569 --> 01:04:11,729
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

884
01:04:13,659 --> 01:04:26,070
[SPEAKER_01]: You ever notice when you're playing DDR, you turn around after two songs, you have this entire crowd behind you, and then on your next song, you just fuck up, and then you turn around, people are gone.

885
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:28,872
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

886
01:04:28,992 --> 01:04:30,453
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like American Idol or something.

887
01:04:30,473 --> 01:04:32,495
[SPEAKER_08]: You screw up one week, bam, you're voted off.

888
01:04:33,636 --> 01:04:34,217
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

889
01:04:34,917 --> 01:04:35,778
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just playing DDR.

890
01:04:36,258 --> 01:04:38,720
[SPEAKER_01]: This weekend, I was the only one that could really play.

891
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:40,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody was just giving me requests.

892
01:04:40,702 --> 01:04:41,663
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, that's cool.

893
01:04:42,766 --> 01:04:44,127
[SPEAKER_08]: and I finally checked out Strike.

894
01:04:44,147 --> 01:04:44,947
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not bad.

895
01:04:45,807 --> 01:04:47,588
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, I haven't checked it out yet.

896
01:04:47,628 --> 01:04:49,209
[SPEAKER_08]: DDR Strike, which just came out in Japan.

897
01:04:49,929 --> 01:04:51,630
[SPEAKER_08]: What's your favorite new song in Strike?

898
01:04:53,170 --> 01:04:55,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's... What's that one song?

899
01:04:56,031 --> 01:04:57,552
[SPEAKER_01]: I must have drank it more than I supposed.

900
01:04:57,732 --> 01:04:59,993
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember the one song I loved the most on there.

901
01:05:00,493 --> 01:05:02,234
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard a lot of good things about the new Akira song.

902
01:05:04,475 --> 01:05:05,735
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I played that one.

903
01:05:06,356 --> 01:05:06,636
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure.

904
01:05:07,096 --> 01:05:07,656
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a good song.

905
01:05:08,256 --> 01:05:08,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Doll?

906
01:05:08,616 --> 01:05:09,757
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard a lot of good things about Doll.

907
01:05:10,993 --> 01:05:12,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's Dance, David Bowie.

908
01:05:12,133 --> 01:05:12,953
[SPEAKER_08]: You know that's got to rock.

909
01:05:13,533 --> 01:05:15,594
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so excited about that.

910
01:05:15,734 --> 01:05:16,174
[SPEAKER_08]: There it is.

911
01:05:16,254 --> 01:05:16,574
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

912
01:05:16,614 --> 01:05:16,874
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

913
01:05:16,894 --> 01:05:18,174
[SPEAKER_02]: That loves me some David Bowie.

914
01:05:18,654 --> 01:05:19,254
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Ranma.

915
01:05:19,274 --> 01:05:20,175
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got to get to other callers.

916
01:05:20,275 --> 01:05:21,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else you want to share with our listeners?

917
01:05:22,975 --> 01:05:24,335
[SPEAKER_01]: When is Loki doing more fusions?

918
01:05:24,355 --> 01:05:27,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, when are you doing more fusion mixes, Loki?

919
01:05:27,416 --> 01:05:27,936
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a while.

920
01:05:28,676 --> 01:05:29,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't you have a thing on MySpace?

921
01:05:29,816 --> 01:05:31,076
[SPEAKER_08]: You haven't plugged that in a long time.

922
01:05:31,817 --> 01:05:33,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but it doesn't have anything new on it, though.

923
01:05:33,717 --> 01:05:34,157
[SPEAKER_08]: No, still.

924
01:05:34,197 --> 01:05:36,737
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of our podcast listeners probably don't even know you do these.

925
01:05:37,398 --> 01:05:39,138
[SPEAKER_07]: MySpace.com slash LokiFusion.

926
01:05:40,445 --> 01:05:41,225
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all one word, Loki.

927
01:05:41,265 --> 01:05:42,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, all one word.

928
01:05:43,946 --> 01:05:44,266
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

929
01:05:44,406 --> 01:05:53,668
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been dabbling, but I haven't... The last thing I did was the not-finished version of Legend of Trance 2006 or something.

930
01:05:54,228 --> 01:05:57,589
[SPEAKER_07]: That was about the last thing I did, and I haven't really done anything since then.

931
01:05:57,629 --> 01:06:08,831
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been trying to... I've been fighting writer's block, trying to do something original for that Konami contest thing.

932
01:06:10,287 --> 01:06:12,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

933
01:06:12,228 --> 01:06:12,548
[SPEAKER_07]: See you later!

934
01:06:40,836 --> 01:06:47,381
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, I forgot to mention, tonight on a very special edition of the Skype line, we're going to play Mention the Oscars, Get Hung Up On.

935
01:06:47,661 --> 01:06:48,362
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be fun.

936
01:06:49,383 --> 01:06:52,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the chat room is lit up with talk about the Oscars right now.

937
01:06:52,866 --> 01:06:55,268
[SPEAKER_08]: You do know that all those votes are bought, right?

938
01:06:55,868 --> 01:06:57,469
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Oscars don't mean shit.

939
01:06:57,589 --> 01:06:58,991
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want you to know, okay?

940
01:06:59,911 --> 01:07:02,313
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're getting Xbox 360s and you're not.

941
01:07:03,154 --> 01:07:03,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably.

942
01:07:03,434 --> 01:07:04,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Did they get Xbox 360s?

943
01:07:04,375 --> 01:07:04,675
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

944
01:07:04,715 --> 01:07:07,717
[SPEAKER_07]: That's completely pure speculation pulled out of my head.

945
01:07:07,758 --> 01:07:08,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Shame on you.

946
01:07:09,059 --> 01:07:09,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Shame.

947
01:07:10,111 --> 01:07:11,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so mention the Oscars, get hung up on.

948
01:07:11,913 --> 01:07:12,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Tonight on Orange Lounge Radio.

949
01:07:13,335 --> 01:07:14,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

950
01:07:18,518 --> 01:07:24,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you there?

951
01:07:24,903 --> 01:07:26,944
[SPEAKER_08]: We're having a hard time hearing you, buddy.

952
01:07:27,004 --> 01:07:28,305
[SPEAKER_08]: So sorry, gotta let you go.

953
01:07:28,665 --> 01:07:33,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Be sure to give Echo123 a call and you can always hear what you sound like there.

954
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:39,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Or of course, you can always try the phone number 916-226-9067, which generally has very few problems.

955
01:07:39,473 --> 01:07:40,274
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's try another call.

956
01:07:40,734 --> 01:07:41,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

957
01:07:42,956 --> 01:07:43,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, how's it going?

958
01:07:43,937 --> 01:07:44,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, good.

959
01:07:44,837 --> 01:07:45,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

960
01:07:46,668 --> 01:07:47,449
[SPEAKER_06]: This is DMN.

961
01:07:47,649 --> 01:07:48,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, DMN.

962
01:07:48,389 --> 01:07:49,050
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind, buddy?

963
01:07:50,391 --> 01:07:54,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, first, I want to know if you guys have any thoughts on Tetris DS.

964
01:07:55,915 --> 01:08:07,683
[SPEAKER_08]: I cannot wait for Tetris DS because I have very fond memories of Tetris on the Game Boy, and I love that they're just redoing it, and it's going to be the whole, like, ten players locally and all that stuff.

965
01:08:07,703 --> 01:08:08,423
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be a good time.

966
01:08:08,523 --> 01:08:09,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Great party game.

967
01:08:09,464 --> 01:08:09,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody...

968
01:08:10,905 --> 01:08:13,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Any... Tetris is like the... Anybody can play Tetris.

969
01:08:13,868 --> 01:08:14,889
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the nice thing about it.

970
01:08:14,929 --> 01:08:16,550
[SPEAKER_08]: It's such an easily accessible game.

971
01:08:17,471 --> 01:08:20,653
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's going to make it a lot of fun and get new people on the DS and stuff.

972
01:08:20,954 --> 01:08:21,995
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be a good time.

973
01:08:22,415 --> 01:08:24,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I tested it and I had a huge blast with it.

974
01:08:25,077 --> 01:08:26,098
[SPEAKER_06]: You tested it?

975
01:08:26,819 --> 01:08:28,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I kind of work over at Nintendo.

976
01:08:29,301 --> 01:08:29,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

977
01:08:31,142 --> 01:08:35,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Too bad you're under NDAs or I'd be grilling you for the scoop right now.

978
01:08:36,970 --> 01:08:39,652
[SPEAKER_06]: It's worth the $30 when it comes out, I guarantee it.

979
01:08:40,532 --> 01:08:41,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome, that's a great tip.

980
01:08:41,793 --> 01:08:44,014
[SPEAKER_08]: What about, I have to ask, Metroid Prime Hunters?

981
01:08:44,174 --> 01:08:46,095
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kind of getting mixed feelings on this one.

982
01:08:46,115 --> 01:08:47,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you get a chance to check this out?

983
01:08:48,176 --> 01:08:50,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I played the demo, I have the demo.

984
01:08:51,137 --> 01:08:55,660
[SPEAKER_06]: My impressions are that first-person shooters do not work on portables.

985
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:57,921
[SPEAKER_06]: I played Doom on the GBA and it was terrible.

986
01:08:58,561 --> 01:09:00,322
[SPEAKER_06]: The demo was just atrocious.

987
01:09:01,122 --> 01:09:03,824
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's going to do well at all.

988
01:09:05,041 --> 01:09:12,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I've got to ask, since you work in the inside, and maybe this is NDA, so feel free to deflect if you must, but do you know something about the revolution that the rest of the world doesn't?

989
01:09:14,266 --> 01:09:16,487
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the same thing you do right now, which is nothing.

990
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:18,167
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't seen it in the department.

991
01:09:18,388 --> 01:09:18,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

992
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:19,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh.

993
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:22,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners?

994
01:09:22,289 --> 01:09:23,110
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going on over there?

995
01:09:24,197 --> 01:09:27,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I might as well plug my anime convention up here.

996
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:29,721
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the gaming manager of SakuraCon.

997
01:09:29,841 --> 01:09:31,442
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in downtown Seattle.

998
01:09:31,702 --> 01:09:32,923
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be a lot of fun.

999
01:09:32,963 --> 01:09:35,164
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be March 24th through the 26th.

1000
01:09:35,204 --> 01:09:35,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Son of a gun.

1001
01:09:35,785 --> 01:09:39,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody's trying to get me to come up to SakuraCon.

1002
01:09:40,488 --> 01:09:43,169
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one of those things where if I can get the time off work, I would go, but I don't know.

1003
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:44,710
[SPEAKER_02]: It's over a weekend, right?

1004
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:49,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Different weekend as what?

1005
01:09:50,194 --> 01:09:53,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, it's Friday through Sunday, right?

1006
01:09:54,642 --> 01:09:55,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

1007
01:09:55,883 --> 01:09:58,566
[SPEAKER_08]: You'd be totally stupid to have a con during the week, so I hope so.

1008
01:09:59,147 --> 01:10:03,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, tell that to the people who do Anime Expo, okay?

1009
01:10:03,952 --> 01:10:06,135
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I'd be down for at least a day of that.

1010
01:10:06,195 --> 01:10:08,798
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how can I pass up SakuraCon?

1011
01:10:10,695 --> 01:10:12,096
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll think of a way to get there.

1012
01:10:12,216 --> 01:10:12,617
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1013
01:10:12,697 --> 01:10:14,458
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to take some clever plotting.

1014
01:10:14,879 --> 01:10:16,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Seattle's not that far of a flight from here.

1015
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:20,364
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to open up the cosplay box and break out the bike and costume.

1016
01:10:20,524 --> 01:10:21,585
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see what we can do.

1017
01:10:21,805 --> 01:10:24,267
[SPEAKER_06]: We're also venturing a new part of DDR.

1018
01:10:24,307 --> 01:10:27,670
[SPEAKER_06]: We're combining DDR and a game show, so we're going to see how that works out.

1019
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:28,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

1020
01:10:28,471 --> 01:10:29,071
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see this.

1021
01:10:29,312 --> 01:10:31,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, if we come up, can we get a panel or something?

1022
01:10:32,577 --> 01:10:33,158
[SPEAKER_08]: or is it too late?

1023
01:10:33,939 --> 01:10:40,887
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a little late, but I could probably see if I could swing you guys in as industry guests or something.

1024
01:10:41,007 --> 01:10:41,828
[SPEAKER_08]: That would rock.

1025
01:10:41,908 --> 01:10:43,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk offline.

1026
01:10:43,049 --> 01:10:44,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Send us an email, okay?

1027
01:10:44,551 --> 01:10:45,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, no problem.

1028
01:10:45,352 --> 01:10:46,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we'll see what we can do.

1029
01:10:46,713 --> 01:10:47,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, take care.

1030
01:10:47,754 --> 01:10:47,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye-bye.

1031
01:10:51,016 --> 01:10:52,016
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1032
01:11:16,743 --> 01:11:20,064
[SPEAKER_02]: and Kennewick because, well, his family lives in Prosser.

1033
01:11:20,725 --> 01:11:29,268
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've been up to Washington State before and we've been sort of thinking about looking for housing in Washington.

1034
01:11:29,288 --> 01:11:30,508
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right around the corner, though.

1035
01:11:30,548 --> 01:11:32,649
[SPEAKER_08]: If we want to go, we've got to book a flight like this week.

1036
01:11:32,949 --> 01:11:37,331
[SPEAKER_02]: You know my husband wants me and him to move to Washington, which I've said no.

1037
01:11:38,075 --> 01:11:41,036
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to talk to my friend in Seattle, see what we can cook up.

1038
01:11:41,556 --> 01:11:42,877
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so we'll see.

1039
01:11:42,897 --> 01:11:43,477
[SPEAKER_08]: No promises.

1040
01:11:43,937 --> 01:11:45,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do one more call.

1041
01:11:45,378 --> 01:11:47,318
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to go over here.

1042
01:11:47,438 --> 01:11:48,599
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1043
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:51,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

1044
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:52,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, who's this?

1045
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:53,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Intended Maniac 64.

1046
01:11:53,641 --> 01:11:55,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, what's on your mind?

1047
01:11:57,342 --> 01:11:58,682
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm real angry.

1048
01:11:58,923 --> 01:12:00,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio doesn't work in Winamp.

1049
01:12:00,943 --> 01:12:02,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio doesn't work in Winamp?

1050
01:12:02,324 --> 01:12:02,804
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going on?

1051
01:12:03,599 --> 01:12:04,281
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1052
01:12:04,301 --> 01:12:07,547
[SPEAKER_05]: It keeps asking me to log in with my Live365 account.

1053
01:12:08,369 --> 01:12:10,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Live365 gives us issues sometimes.

1054
01:12:11,195 --> 01:12:14,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you letting the computer retain cookies?

1055
01:12:17,316 --> 01:12:17,737
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

1056
01:12:19,218 --> 01:12:19,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Do us a favor.

1057
01:12:20,058 --> 01:12:21,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Send Live365 an email.

1058
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:26,783
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish there was more we could do on that end, but there's really unfortunately not a lot.

1059
01:12:27,063 --> 01:12:33,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Believe me, though, we are aware, and every time things like this happen, it makes us not want to be there anymore.

1060
01:12:34,148 --> 01:12:36,410
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, we're kind of stuck for right now.

1061
01:12:37,183 --> 01:12:38,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm living with Frio Player right now.

1062
01:12:39,504 --> 01:12:40,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Many people don't like it.

1063
01:12:40,845 --> 01:12:41,285
[SPEAKER_04]: It works.

1064
01:12:41,926 --> 01:12:46,328
[SPEAKER_08]: I use iTunes sometimes, but the thing is that Winamp is the only way you can get MP3 Pro.

1065
01:12:46,628 --> 01:12:49,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Little known fact, the podcast is actually encoded in MP3 Pro.

1066
01:12:50,050 --> 01:12:53,552
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you listen to the podcast in Winamp with the codec, it actually sounds a lot cleaner.

1067
01:12:53,672 --> 01:12:55,393
[SPEAKER_08]: So just a little thought there.

1068
01:12:56,253 --> 01:12:57,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, cool.

1069
01:12:57,554 --> 01:12:59,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well, Nintendo Maniac, thanks for the call.

1070
01:12:59,615 --> 01:13:00,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else you want to share?

1071
01:13:02,836 --> 01:13:05,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Unlike the last guy, I'm actually excited about Metroid Prime Hunters.

1072
01:13:06,867 --> 01:13:07,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Any particular reason why?

1073
01:13:10,790 --> 01:13:11,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Well... Online?

1074
01:13:11,731 --> 01:13:12,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Multiplayer, maybe?

1075
01:13:13,252 --> 01:13:14,593
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess, yeah.

1076
01:13:14,634 --> 01:13:15,754
[SPEAKER_08]: I need another online player.

1077
01:13:15,915 --> 01:13:18,116
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just curious if that's going to be as cool as it sounds.

1078
01:13:18,697 --> 01:13:19,638
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking forward to it, though.

1079
01:13:21,799 --> 01:13:22,079
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1080
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:22,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, take care, buddy.

1081
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:23,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for calling.

1082
01:13:24,261 --> 01:13:24,481
[SPEAKER_08]: See ya.

1083
01:13:24,622 --> 01:13:24,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Later.

1084
01:13:25,823 --> 01:13:27,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, thank you guys so much for calling in.

1085
01:13:28,024 --> 01:13:28,945
[SPEAKER_08]: We appreciate it there.

1086
01:13:30,146 --> 01:13:31,227
[SPEAKER_08]: That's our Skype line.

1087
01:13:31,307 --> 01:13:36,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get back into the news for one last story here tonight.

1088
01:13:37,449 --> 01:13:41,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, first, before I get to the last story, I'll go around and see if there's any last-minute entries here.

1089
01:13:41,390 --> 01:13:43,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, because I think I saw you bring up something on the origami.

1090
01:13:43,991 --> 01:13:45,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that like a last-minute addition here?

1091
01:13:45,711 --> 01:13:46,631
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a picture of it.

1092
01:13:47,411 --> 01:13:51,432
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little bit smaller than the concept video that they showed because that video was pretty old.

1093
01:13:52,072 --> 01:13:56,953
[SPEAKER_07]: But still, I think I could take somebody out with this thing.

1094
01:13:57,093 --> 01:13:58,834
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been giving this thing a hard time tonight.

1095
01:13:58,974 --> 01:14:04,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, if I had the money to throw away on something, if I was a business person that made a lot of money,

1096
01:14:04,568 --> 01:14:30,301
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe I would check this out but until we hear about some gaming stuff it's still going to be the butt of our jokes sorry yeah anyways um well first thing I gotta mention because this is like a major story we're just kind of glancing over oh sorry DS Lite actually launched in Japan oh yeah I thought you covered it's so pretty I thought you covered this on one of the mini shows yeah well I may have mentioned it but yeah DS Lite launched it's pretty it's bright it's

1097
01:14:31,323 --> 01:14:32,826
[SPEAKER_07]: It's everything we had hoped for.

1098
01:14:33,086 --> 01:14:34,909
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, that's kind of cool.

1099
01:14:35,069 --> 01:14:37,673
[SPEAKER_07]: And then what else was I going to mention here?

1100
01:14:37,733 --> 01:14:38,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, if you like...

1101
01:14:40,859 --> 01:14:41,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Geometry Wars.

1102
01:14:42,180 --> 01:15:08,589
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a nice little knockoff here you can download at www.incitti.com slash blitz and they've got a nice little game you can play here that's a clone of Geometry Wars 3 and also another game called Marble Insanity which is just like Marble Madness and unfortunately that's not available for download yet but it looks really sweet with what they're doing and finally of course Rockstar announced a new game that they're making this week

1103
01:15:09,616 --> 01:15:12,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Table Tennis Table Tennis Table Tennis Table Tennis Table Tennis

1104
01:15:32,506 --> 01:15:35,668
[SPEAKER_07]: And as I mentioned before, Trauma Center is coming out for the revolution.

1105
01:15:36,209 --> 01:15:39,351
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's according to the IGN podcast.

1106
01:15:39,551 --> 01:15:41,732
[SPEAKER_07]: If you didn't get that joke, by the way, ask your mommy and daddy.

1107
01:15:43,914 --> 01:15:44,974
[SPEAKER_08]: But don't tell them you heard it here.

1108
01:15:45,054 --> 01:15:51,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Ubisoft announced that they're going to be releasing a new Rainbow Six game for next-gen consoles, Rainbow Six Vegas.

1109
01:15:52,359 --> 01:15:56,462
[SPEAKER_07]: And this has actually come from the brand-new issue of EGM.

1110
01:15:56,902 --> 01:15:58,864
[SPEAKER_07]: So it looks pretty sweet so far.

1111
01:16:00,285 --> 01:16:00,545
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

1112
01:16:02,102 --> 01:16:11,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, Bungie says that I Love Bees 2 is fake.

1113
01:16:11,585 --> 01:16:16,946
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate viral marketing because viral marketing is not viral anymore.

1114
01:16:17,166 --> 01:16:18,107
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just no one cares.

1115
01:16:18,167 --> 01:16:18,607
[SPEAKER_07]: It's trendy.

1116
01:16:19,527 --> 01:16:20,067
[SPEAKER_07]: It's stupid.

1117
01:16:20,187 --> 01:16:24,508
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like before, you know, people didn't know what they were advertising.

1118
01:16:24,628 --> 01:16:26,929
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just something that's like, whoa, what is this, you know?

1119
01:16:27,349 --> 01:16:28,930
[SPEAKER_07]: And you try to figure out more information.

1120
01:16:28,990 --> 01:16:29,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the whole thing with...

1121
01:16:31,121 --> 01:16:34,923
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if that could be an announcement for the Splinter Cell for the 360 or whatever, it's just retarded.

1122
01:16:56,735 --> 01:16:57,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Just my rant there.

1123
01:16:57,696 --> 01:16:58,797
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1124
01:16:58,917 --> 01:17:00,779
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, you have any last stories for us?

1125
01:17:01,219 --> 01:17:01,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Just out of curiosity?

1126
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:03,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything you've been holding out on?

1127
01:17:04,102 --> 01:17:04,722
[SPEAKER_08]: Just wanted to check.

1128
01:17:05,563 --> 01:17:07,085
[SPEAKER_08]: I will continue to keep my secrets.

1129
01:17:07,545 --> 01:17:07,845
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1130
01:17:08,566 --> 01:17:10,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, here, I have something that might interest you.

1131
01:17:10,127 --> 01:17:13,851
[SPEAKER_08]: This seems like something you'd get a kick out of because it's Sega-related, and we know you're a Sega fangirl.

1132
01:17:13,891 --> 01:17:14,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Here it is.

1133
01:17:14,732 --> 01:17:17,474
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is a story that ran on Joystick earlier this week.

1134
01:17:17,754 --> 01:17:20,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you know that there was a Penn & Teller Sega CD game?

1135
01:17:22,359 --> 01:17:22,559
[SPEAKER_08]: It was...

1136
01:17:23,178 --> 01:17:23,879
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that.

1137
01:17:23,959 --> 01:17:26,540
[SPEAKER_08]: It was Penn & Teller Smoke & Mirrors is what it was called.

1138
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:29,502
[SPEAKER_08]: It was never released actually, which is why you've probably never heard of it.

1139
01:17:29,542 --> 01:17:37,707
[SPEAKER_08]: But get this, there actually is a torrent out there now floating on the internet so you can download it, burn it, and just load it up in the Sega CD.

1140
01:17:39,443 --> 01:17:43,226
[SPEAKER_08]: There's actually a part in this game that the article talks about called the Desert Bus Minigame.

1141
01:17:43,587 --> 01:17:44,808
[SPEAKER_08]: You drive a bus in the desert.

1142
01:17:45,088 --> 01:17:47,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Your goal is to go from Tucson, Arizona to Las Vegas.

1143
01:17:47,890 --> 01:17:53,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Your bus never goes more than 45 miles an hour, so the trip takes approximately 8 hours in real time to make.

1144
01:17:53,875 --> 01:17:58,019
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no scenery or even other cars on the road, just plain desert for 8 hours.

1145
01:17:58,599 --> 01:18:03,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and your bus veers to the right just slightly, so it's impossible to just tape down a button and go do something else.

1146
01:18:03,783 --> 01:18:06,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Rumor has it that if you make it to Vegas, you score one point.

1147
01:18:07,409 --> 01:18:08,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds awesome.

1148
01:18:08,390 --> 01:18:09,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't wait to play it.

1149
01:18:11,631 --> 01:18:12,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Never released.

1150
01:18:12,372 --> 01:18:13,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Imagine that.

1151
01:18:13,252 --> 01:18:15,853
[SPEAKER_07]: I have one more story, but it's quite funny.

1152
01:18:18,195 --> 01:18:19,275
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted the last story.

1153
01:18:21,076 --> 01:18:27,839
[SPEAKER_07]: French developer Cyanide has launched their online home of their forthcoming action RPG, Loki.

1154
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:31,321
[SPEAKER_08]: You ass.

1155
01:18:31,401 --> 01:18:34,483
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not a whole lot of content on the site at the moment.

1156
01:18:34,883 --> 01:18:36,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a forum and some screenshots.

1157
01:18:38,018 --> 01:18:40,760
[SPEAKER_07]: But my guess is going to be it's based around my life.

1158
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:42,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, shut up.

1159
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:43,521
[SPEAKER_07]: As exciting as it is.

1160
01:18:43,661 --> 01:18:44,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Trolls and all.

1161
01:18:44,522 --> 01:18:44,682
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1162
01:18:45,102 --> 01:18:48,504
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just had to point that out because, you know, it's funny.

1163
01:18:49,344 --> 01:18:49,745
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1164
01:18:50,365 --> 01:18:53,006
[SPEAKER_08]: On that egotistical note, it's time to end the show.

1165
01:18:53,547 --> 01:18:57,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Our special guest, Spike, our buddy Spike, thank you so much for being here tonight.

1166
01:18:57,949 --> 01:18:58,830
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for having me.

1167
01:18:59,390 --> 01:19:05,433
[SPEAKER_08]: And laughing at our jokes, which makes us feel good, and praising the almighty Dark Sakura, I noticed, at certain points there during the show.

1168
01:19:05,513 --> 01:19:06,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Make my ego grow.

1169
01:19:08,098 --> 01:19:08,718
[SPEAKER_08]: She's awesome.

1170
01:19:08,778 --> 01:19:09,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Just add Wata.

1171
01:19:10,359 --> 01:19:13,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I'm really excited now to go download this Penn & Teller game.

1172
01:19:14,060 --> 01:19:15,161
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me know how the bus driving goes.

1173
01:19:15,781 --> 01:19:16,881
[SPEAKER_08]: Any final thoughts for our listeners?

1174
01:19:19,202 --> 01:19:20,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Quiz and Dragons?

1175
01:19:21,503 --> 01:19:21,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Look, buddy.

1176
01:19:23,324 --> 01:19:24,064
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a challenge.

1177
01:19:24,224 --> 01:19:25,325
[SPEAKER_08]: You're issuing a challenge here.

1178
01:19:25,785 --> 01:19:27,325
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Loki, your final thought.

1179
01:19:30,146 --> 01:19:32,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I can't wait to play some new games this week.

1180
01:19:33,648 --> 01:19:34,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Burnout and...

1181
01:19:35,217 --> 01:19:39,399
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess Burnout's not exactly a new game, but I don't know.

1182
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:41,741
[SPEAKER_07]: I look forward to playing Burnout again.

1183
01:19:42,881 --> 01:19:45,683
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought is the Oscars are a sham.

1184
01:19:46,243 --> 01:19:52,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you just go watch a movie that looks interesting and not that somebody told you to watch or told you that was good?

1185
01:19:52,446 --> 01:19:54,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Make up your own mind.

1186
01:19:54,627 --> 01:19:57,769
[SPEAKER_08]: They pay millions of dollars for those ads and variety.

1187
01:19:58,349 --> 01:19:59,210
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a sham.

1188
01:20:00,310 --> 01:20:01,091
[SPEAKER_08]: Go outside.

1189
01:20:02,554 --> 01:20:03,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Support independent films too.

1190
01:20:04,054 --> 01:20:05,715
[SPEAKER_08]: You can watch a big blockbuster once in a while.

1191
01:20:05,735 --> 01:20:08,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't forget to go to your local art house cinema because you might be missing something good.

1192
01:20:08,756 --> 01:20:09,756
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

1193
01:20:10,176 --> 01:20:11,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Reject false icons.

1194
01:20:11,577 --> 01:20:11,837
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1195
01:20:12,317 --> 01:20:17,819
