6994	12556	Hi, we're back here for the Orange Launch Radio Afterbirth, the part of the show that's too hot to podcast.
13336	16978	Because Bugged is going to show us his boobies right now.
17398	17778	Woo!
17798	20119	Hooray for boobies.
20959	21499	That's next week.
21739	28382	Alright, so here we are, just kind of chilling, sitting back here, kind of decompressing a little bit from tonight's show.
28422	30603	You know the first half of tonight's show was an hour and a half?
31994	32375	Crazy.
33115	35056	That's, I think, our longest segment we've ever done.
35156	37338	We just can't shut up, like, ever.
37478	38578	You have three halves of a show.
39779	40760	Yeah, seriously.
43001	43661	Oh, I like this.
43701	44062	You like this?
44122	48064	Right at the end of the show, here comes Bobby Blackwolf from AllGames.com into the chat room.
48384	53647	He just came in there and he said, let's see, I said, what's up?
53968	55108	And he says, you're cancelled.
55308	55829	I'm like, what?
56109	57410	He said, oh no, just messing with you guys.
58186	59227	What a jerk.
59247	59687	You jerk.
61108	63670	My whole problem with Captain N, like I said... Uh-oh.
63690	64430	Wait, wait, wait.
64450	64750	This is random.
64770	65371	Where's this coming from?
65391	66852	This is because of the Captain N thing.
66972	67292	Oh, okay.
67432	68333	He was actually replying to me.
68553	68853	Gotcha.
70746	75689	My whole problem with the Captain N thing is because I loved following the stories ever since I was little.
76549	85194	And to see characters that I had loved in the games being just trashed so horribly for the sake of marketing just completely pissed me off.
85574	90656	Even though I did watch the show religiously, because the Zelda episodes were redeeming.
90676	92517	I thought the Tetris thing was pretty freaking funny.
93958	96019	And I love Mother Brain and the Eggplant Wizard.
96259	97960	Dennis Hopper as Koopa.
98362	99644	Yeah, there was that.
100264	100845	There was that.
102046	115963	But there were just so many things I could not get over in that, even as a little kid, that to this day I have this long-standing, I wouldn't say a hatred, but a frustration with the whole Captain N franchise.
119807	120548	You know what's funny?
121648	123110	The fact that I never watched Captain N?
123490	142165	No, not Captain N. I was reading there was another news story that came out this week regarding G4 and how they're doing Star Trek 2.0 on their station, basically putting on the old episodes of Star Trek and having a bunch of different counters and stuff like how many times, you know, Spock... Pop-up Star Trek?
142845	143466	Exactly!
143546	148390	It's like how many times, you know, Spock says, you know, logical or illogical and
149102	149803	Internet is for Porn
177042	178063	The internet is not for porn.
178343	179043	Guess what, kids?
179083	180023	Skype line's open.
180063	182465	We thought we'd take some calls here after the podcast.
182825	183925	Let's see what's on your minds.
183965	185206	Let's go to the Skype line.
185666	187607	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio after birth.
187867	188247	Lucky you.
189248	189448	Hello.
189848	190348	Hi, who's this?
191349	192329	This is Xander from Florida.
192510	193450	Hi, Xander from Florida.
193470	193950	What's on your mind?
195691	196211	Oh, boy.
197732	198452	A lot of stuff.
200834	202374	Xander, you sound sad tonight.
203535	204275	Do you need a hug?
204295	205216	Are you a sad puppy?
206337	206677	Sort of.
207077	214421	But I went to a concert Saturday or whatever, and I got really, really, really bad whiplash.
215881	216922	Oh, crap, that sucks.
216942	217762	What was the concert?
217782	220744	It was a Christian concert.
221284	222424	I went with my youth group.
222845	223805	Christian death metal?
224265	226406	There is Christian death metal.
227427	228387	I've heard it before.
231068	232129	Time to Google that shit up.
235876	241000	Sorry, if you guys are having problems with Live365, we've got issues right now.
241120	249287	It's this whole stupid Live365 upgrade with the DMCA stuff, where if we're not sending live track data to them, they pull the plug on us.
249447	250368	God, that pisses me off.
250408	253030	I swear, I'm so angry with this.
253411	260337	We've been with Live365 for four years now, and it seems like... We're making our lives more frustrating.
260437	264220	VX, we're going to have a chat soon about this, because I'm getting a little tired of this poopy.
265111	266572	Is there anywhere else you guys could go?
267552	271034	We're thinking about doing something independently, but we just don't know if we have the resources.
271294	272474	The bandwidth is not cheap.
273055	279177	We were hoping somebody big would put an offer to buy us out for a million dollars, but seeing as that won't happen, I guess we'll just have to fight for ourselves.
282279	284640	Or you could put up PayPal or something.
286381	289342	I'm trying to fix the OLR thing right now, so we'll see what happens here.
293975	295116	So anything else on your mind, Xander?
297138	299159	I wanted to talk about Guitar Room Man a little bit.
299360	299860	Okay, what's up?
300501	304164	Because I got it for my birthday, and have any of you beat it?
305164	305865	No, I never have.
306425	309048	We almost got a beat at my house, but it wasn't me that did it.
310949	319957	Because I'm stuck on San Bunchio on Masters, and I swear this has to be the hardest game I've played in my life.
320717	321558	It's just nasty.
325471	327492	What do you mean a good game for once, Miklatov?
327892	328132	Sorry.
330434	333375	Are you yelling back at our chatroom there, www.orangellandradio.com?
333435	334015	Okay, I gotcha.
334436	334696	Alright.
335796	337617	Alright, we're gonna go ahead and let you go, Xander.
337637	338938	We're gonna try and get one more call, alright?
339738	340019	Okay.
340139	340539	Have a good one.
343340	344481	Let's go to another call here.
345802	346442	Let's go to this one.
347262	348083	Hi, you're on Orange Land Radio.
349113	349975	Hey, what's up, boss?
350115	352300	Obviously, you already know who I am.
352500	352941	Hello, Saku.
354904	356024	Yeah, what's up, boss?
356344	356704	Not much.
356965	359125	We want to finish up tonight's show, so you got to keep it short.
359145	359665	What's on your mind?
360285	364206	Basically, I'm just, you know, yesterday I went to an anime convention.
364246	367987	I was lucky to play, you know, 2DX and Poppin' on their respective ASCs.
369127	375609	I don't know if it's normal, but I mean, the transition between both of them is kind of strange.
375669	383491	I know for a fact that when I was playing 2DX, it was just like my scores decreased as a result because I'm used to the KLC.
384850	390603	I don't know if there's anything you can help me, you know, any advice you can give me if I try... What was the controller they were using?
391528	392288	I was there for an hour.
392308	393269	I was on the 2DX setup for several hours.
417230	421373	So, you know, at least three to four hours, because it was very small.
421393	423914	No one was really there at the 2DX setup.
424554	426015	I honestly don't know what to tell you, bud.
426055	427756	It's just kind of one of those things you just have to get used to.
427776	434941	There's really no way I can tell you to... My thing is, is that maybe you get used to one playing style on the home controller, but here's the thing.
434981	441425	The big trick to being able to scratch in 2DX is that, and this takes a while to get the hang of, is the pinky scratching.
441765	445307	You have to be able to move that turntable with your pinky, and I know it sounds a little crazy.
445327	446728	Yeah, I tend to do that as well.
447028	448952	Well, you really gotta master that.
448972	450656	Digital Life this year in New York City.
451617	452960	You know, the annual thing.
453040	457009	I know you tried valiantly to try to make plans last year.
457089	458191	When is Digital Life this year?
459122	460263	It should be in October.
461444	467368	They already pre-announced the event when I came there.
467968	471310	As soon as I left the convention center, there was a sign that said, see you next year.
471671	473252	It said the date in mid-October.
473672	474152	I'm not sure.
474172	479496	I haven't got confirmation about the big DDR Nationals tournament being held up.
479876	484800	But most likely they will hold it up, assuming now that Supernova is getting more...
485760	488864	I don't know if you're going to make plans for it.
488884	490726	I just want to know if you are.
498069	498929	What, for digital life?
499750	502591	Yeah, if you're planning to go out there, do something live or something.
507874	509215	It's a budget thing for us.
509495	513577	I mean, if we had the money to do it, we would, but we don't make money off of doing this.
513617	517059	We do this show because we love it, and I think people sometimes forget that sometimes.
517459	517619	Right.
518700	519221	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
530715	534398	But, you know, if we have the money, I'm sure we'll try it, but it'll be an individual thing.
534518	537501	I mean, we'll have to decide as individuals if we can accommodate it into our schedule.
537921	539042	I would love to try and come.
539082	541124	I have a good friend in New York City that would let me stay there.
541925	542926	So, maybe.
543626	547189	I would say, probably, I would do it.
547670	551553	And I would say, probably, I'm more likely to do it than DarkSakura or Loki.
551593	551994	I don't know.
552054	553375	Are you guys thinking about this, or...
554586	561531	I don't have the available time off, especially since there are other things to be discussed.
578903	579905	Not going to happen for me.
580346	585333	I totally forgot that I have plans to go to Canada to celebrate the 4th of July.
585434	586095	Just to be funny.
586415	588338	Actually, I can't say which one yet.
588398	590101	I am making arrangements for another convention.
590522	590782	Sweet!
593271	596093	All right, well, Zaku, thanks for the call, and take care, okay?
596693	597713	All right, later, man.
598274	604437	Sorry to the calls we didn't get to, but we've got to wrap up tonight's show because we want to, you know, go back to our regular lives.
604857	607179	So we're going to get into tonight's cage match.
607679	609120	Wait, wait, you guys have lives outside of this?
609380	610681	Believe it or not, once in a while.
611261	612141	That's my problem.
612181	613102	I keep forgetting that part.
614603	614843	All right.
616043	616404	Let's see here.
616424	617804	I've got to find the theme music here.
617864	619806	My directories are all screwed up now.
623209	625910	Loki, remind our listeners how the cage match works while I set this up.
626491	649401	The cage match works basically we have three songs that are put in by each one of the hosts then we play each song in its entirety except for the one that won and the winning song of the cage match is put in the rotation and will come up to be challenged by two more songs next week and the actual listeners in our chat room get to vote on them.
649881	650922	to see which one goes on.
651643	652083	Sweet!
653164	654145	Alright, let's see.
654165	656827	I'm trying to find the song here from last week.
658249	660451	I was exhausted tonight.
660471	661191	I'm sorry, guys.
662532	664194	I apologize to our live listeners.
664294	666876	They've had to put up with a lot of crap tonight, so I apologize.
667377	668778	Blame it all on caffeine.
669339	670139	Because we sure are.
672081	672662	Alright, let's see.
672702	674623	Where's my new stuff here?
674643	674904	Let's see.
678434	678734	There it is.
678774	679797	Alright, there's last week's winner.
679838	680620	Okay, now we can do this.
681482	683367	Alright, cue the theme music, please.
685233	685514	Thank you.
687068	693233	Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, we had The Azoic, who's a band that you might know from DDR Ultramix 3.
693673	700298	They had a song that's been remixed for a new album they have coming out, and it's called Going Under, and it's the kinetic mix.
700919	708885	And that's what won last week's Cage Match, so here it is, a clip of song number one tonight, The Azoic, with Going Under, the kinetic mix.
708905	709085	Enjoy.
709105	709346	Enjoy.
835717	837678	Alright, that was song number one in tonight's cage match.
837698	839759	The Azoic with Going Under, the kinetic mix.
840199	843161	We'll see if they can win two weeks in a row, but it's gotta beat these songs.
843221	844562	Loki, what's song number two tonight?
845002	848384	This song is one of my favorite songs from Burnout Revenge.
848864	852085	It's actually by Junkie XL, and it's a song called Today.
852105	854347	It kind of reminds me a little bit of Depeche Mode in a way.
854947	856007	But it's an awesome song.
856047	860870	My favorite bar none of all the tracks are on the Burnout series.
862571	864092	So, that would be...
866618	871502	I actually looked for the album because this is the title from the album.
873103	873423	Sounds good.
873443	876705	Here's song number two tonight, Junkie XL with Today from Burnout.
878026	882529	Burnout.
975605	976197	And it's
1025523	1026637	The way that holds
1055931	1056261	DJ Ranma
1150303	1176999	And it feels like today So just hold on tight and let it slip away And it feels like today So just hold on tight and let it slip away
1179260	1179848	I just feel like
1276055	1277316	Song number two.
1277356	1279599	That was Junkie XL with Today.
1279699	1282742	Let's see what the studio folks thought of that.
1282762	1285284	But remember, it is up to you guys, but you have to be in our chat room to vote.
1285344	1285945	DarkSakura.
1286466	1287467	That one was pretty neato.
1288367	1289729	It gets an eight.
1290309	1290610	Loki.
1291150	1291410	Ten.
1291531	1291891	I love it.
1292011	1293653	I play all my races to that song.
1294861	1296263	I have Roz to blame for this one
1314272	1315493	It's a Tally Hall song.
1315933	1317053	It's called True Love.
1317694	1318474	True Love?
1318634	1319295	True Love.
1319635	1320835	Is that like the Princess Bride?
1320955	1321175	Marriage.
1321215	1321656	Marriage.
1321736	1322676	True Love.
1323236	1325077	Marriage.
1325578	1327298	True Blade.
1327318	1327398	Scum.
1328439	1329459	Alright, here we go.
1329480	1332701	We're going to go to Tally Hall with True Love.
1332961	1333982	Here it is, song number three tonight.
1346599	1372460	I have this little thing It's probably just a fling Two girls I like a lot I think they're really hot But I'm not sure if they know How my love began to grow It took a lot of time But right now it's only
1377890	1407363	I drew a mural of the things I'd like to love And where my heart resides is with two girls with great eyes If they just gave me a chance, I'd show them what they want and teach them what they got I'd steal each and every one of their fancies I'd take the key to my heart and open it and let the love shine through Mary Kate and Ashley, I hope you understand
1418783	1433089	I saw you on TV You dressed up like a bee Reminds me of the time How it's gone and it's gone and it's gone
1449265	1462588	I hope you understand that I love you a lot And I wanna be your man And I think that it'd be totally cool If I'm around your apartments And you're going to your school Hello?
1462608	1462808	Hello?
1462868	1463448	Hello?
1463488	1465729	Hey, I'm calling from Tally Hall Hello?
1465789	1465949	Hello?
1466109	1471290	Hey, I'm calling from Tally Hall and I... Mary Kate and Ashley I hope you understand that I love you
1491914	1502100	I know that life without you and you would be sad, and I know it'd be bad.
1515191	1516051	Thank you for watching!
1555103	1558126	Song number three tonight, Tally Hall with Twilove.
1558726	1560948	Did you love that song or did you hate it?
1561309	1561909	DarkSakura.
1561989	1563431	It gets a ten for being ridiculous.
1564432	1564732	Loki.
1565092	1565933	It is ridiculous.
1565993	1568916	Everyone knows it's pre-anorexic Lindsay Lohan.
1568956	1569797	That's worth loving.
1571398	1572159	Can you score?
1572179	1572479	Huh?
1572940	1573780	Can you score?
1574741	1575082	Seven.
1575302	1575642	All right.
1576483	1578345	I'll give it eight.
1578385	1579686	It had a good beat and you can answer to it.
1580046	1580326	All right.
1581326	1585247	And I will give it the combined weight of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, which is eight.
1585547	1586027	Eight pounds.
1586187	1587107	That's how much they weigh.
1587728	1588068	All right.
1589068	1591148	It's definitely a genre night.
1591428	1595769	Actually, I think all the songs are actually really good tonight, I think, in their respective genres.
1596109	1597790	So it all comes down to what you like best.

1664391	1665913	Sorry, we got dead air there for a minute.
1665973	1666774	I'm very sorry there.
1668035	1668996	Let's recap there.
1669036	1670537	Hopefully some folks are still connected there.
1670577	1672239	Just a little soundboard problem on my end.
1672259	1672700	Sorry, guys.
1673661	1674522	Let's go back.
1674722	1675723	Place vote now.
1676343	1677204	And here we go.
1677725	1678325	How was your week?
1678345	1678946	How was your day?
1679066	1680187	Loki starting us off tonight.
1680508	1681048	Anyways, I...
1682009	1684310	We're starting to finalize more stuff for the wedding.
1684670	1694733	We set aside some time to, or we're going to go pick up our marriage license and we're also, we just sent out the rest of the invitations.
1695334	1710379	We have someone now making favors and just kind of some of that stuff and I've been playing video games most of the week and just work stuff, you know, trying to, you know, finish March and get April started and
1711360	1712321	You know, fun stuff.
1712601	1718786	And then we did a marathon session of Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories after work last week.
1719307	1722690	We got to play one of the modes that they have on there.
1723270	1724911	It's Tanks for Memories.
1725072	1726253	And that's actually pretty fun.
1726673	1728615	You start off and you pick up the tank.
1729535	1731857	And then once you're in the tank, everybody else is trying to blow up the tank.
1731897	1734299	And you're trying to stay in the tank for...
1735481	1736283	A set amount of time.
1736364	1738429	And so your timer's counting down while you're in the tank.
1738509	1741357	If your tank explodes, the person that destroyed the tank...
1742278	1753061	I'm hoping that the next Grand Theft Auto that comes out does support more players because six players is fun but I mean I would like maybe 10 or 12 at the most I think would be really good
1772831	1774693	Get some good team matches going on there.
1777215	1778717	Other than that, really not too much else.
1779918	1784082	I had garlic on Friday and I still smell like garlic today.
1785062	1789767	After numerous showers and brushing my teeth, that smell does not go away.
1790167	1792009	You smell like garlic, I smell like a mocha.
1793770	1796733	I'm still tasting curry from Thursday night and I only have one forkful.
1799512	1799812	Is that it?
1800333	1800773	That's it.
1801874	1802554	DarkSakura.
1802895	1803395	Oh, wait, never mind.
1803695	1804256	She's busy over there.
1804316	1806537	Oh, that and our apartments trapping cats now.
1806777	1807118	Fun.
1807818	1808479	Bugged, how was your week?
1808499	1808839	How was your day?
1810472	1811853	My week was rather uneventful.
1811973	1824344	Let's see, I had a whirlwind tour through the Bay Area to drop stuff off and pick stuff up for the roommate and I as we are both rather unemployed and still needing to pay bills, so we're selling off stuff.
1824844	1827186	If anybody needs computers, I got some.
1829749	1830429	I'm out of hard drives.
1831970	1832991	I already sold all those off.
1834993	1835213	But...
1839079	1839259	No.
1839880	1844643	In fact, my roommate is waiting on a replacement screen for his ThinkPad.
1845324	1855332	Whirlwind Tour, playing video games, raiding trash heaps, finding Macs of all things, and reconstituting them into machines to be sold.
1858496	1859256	Yes, exciting.
1859496	1860316	Oh, and playing Diablo 2.
1860396	1861717	Alright, fun times.
1863177	1865097	My week and my day was pretty good.
1865137	1868558	I went to Roseville Golf Land on Friday?
1868678	1869238	No, Saturday.
1869418	1869838	Last night.
1869898	1870398	Yeah, last night.
1870418	1871799	I'm drunk.
1871819	1872839	No, I'm not.
1873399	1874739	For the first time in forever.
1875679	1877340	It was interesting.
1878820	1884621	I actually had a lot of fun playing Initial D and stuff and just kind of being there with a couple people.
1885121	1887383	But DDR was still kind of assy.
1887683	1889724	But, you know, I find that I like this.
1889824	1890925	And it's not the game itself.
1890945	1891666	There's nothing wrong with the game.
1891706	1894227	It's just the machine and the upkeep of it at Roseville is crappy.
1894267	1894768	What upkeep?
1894848	1897990	And I hate the people that go to Roseville Golf Line.
1898310	1903133	Roseville Golf Line would be wonderful if the nuclear holocaust hit it and only me and my friends survived.
1903593	1905094	That would be great if it took out Granite Bay.
1906355	1906996	Honestly, yes.
1907236	1909958	So, you know, I had an okay time.
1911098	1912379	That's really all I feel like sharing.
1912399	1912659	Mario Kart?
1914244	1915105	Mario Kart's okay.
1915525	1916627	I mean, I didn't play it last year.
1916647	1917688	Did they have any other games?
1917848	1918148	New games?
1918508	1919209	I heard, what was it?
1919249	1922773	I wanted to play, uh, Wangan, Wangan Midnight Maximum 2.
1922813	1923293	What was it?
1923654	1925075	Fucking all the thugs were on that game.
1925095	1927317	What about, um, one of the Roseville theaters?
1927337	1928318	This was at Time Crisis 4.
1929602	1930203	I haven't checked it out.
1930283	1932485	Or not Time Crisis 4, House of the Dead 4.
1932686	1933406	No, I haven't checked it out.
1933527	1934147	That's UCD.
1934167	1937952	Oh, and Spike was here last week, and I believe told us that that was at Century.
1938372	1940755	It's wherever Nightwatch is playing in Roselle, because that's what they went and saw.
1941616	1942917	So that's where he would have seen it.
1945020	1946361	Oh, this is funny, because...
1948645	1956913	Out there in the living room right now, everything is labeled in Russian because Extifer is learning Russian and Loki's fiance is teaching it to him.
1957433	1960816	And so they've taken index cards and labeled everything in the living room in Russian.
1961156	1963979	And it actually has to stay up for a couple weeks.
1964499	1965500	So that should be interesting.
1965520	1967202	You're going to be learning this real quick.
1967222	1968062	I don't know how to read it.
1968122	1970084	Your front room looks like a Russian kindergarten.
1970164	1970545	It does.
1970605	1971946	It looks like a Russian kindergarten right now.
1971986	1972767	It's kind of scary.
1973347	1974248	You need to buy some beets.
1975703	1977705	DarkSakura, how was your week?
1977745	1978526	How was your day?
1978566	1980448	Oh, Confusion Friday night was badass, by the way.
1980488	1980888	Yes, it was.
1980908	1981949	We had a good time.
1981969	1983210	Picture hoarded up.
1983230	1983631	It was great.
1983671	1984411	Mistress Tia, love her.
1999201	2008164	I actually, I ripped off some of my pictures too, I was, Confusion was probably the most, was the highlight of my week, because the rest of my week was shit.
2008564	2009024	Oh, I'm sorry.
2009384	2013786	By the way, just a quick FYI, Jason wanted me to let you know that the pictures are up, so I'm going to grab them and I'll send them to you later.
2013806	2020188	Cool, because I need the, there's a pic that Extover took of me with the camera, of doing the too much metal for one hand.
2020288	2022469	I'll get them from Jason, and I'm pretty sure I know where he put them.
2022489	2023309	That's going to be in my space photo.
2023769	2025070	Okay, Pat, I should check.
2025371	2030375	He usually puts all my stuff in a... He has a web server on his computer, so... I have a picture of me on MySpace playing a bass, which is what I was doing last night.
2030435	2030796	Cool!
2031076	2040564	I went over to Miss Tia's house, or apartment, to, uh... Now, I am a vegetarian now, except for fish.
2040604	2041205	I will eat fish.
2042046	2042506	But, um...
2043888	2050576	We have to every so often because me and Tia and her roommate Jovan are like the Sacramento Southern Collection.
2051557	2056903	So we had fried chicken and biscuits and red beans and rice and mashed potatoes and gravy.
2056963	2057464	Homemade.
2057985	2058525	No Popeyes.
2059346	2060287	Which is close enough!
2060307	2061047	It's very close.
2061107	2062188	It's very, very southern.
2062748	2081901	So we all were getting our fried chicken on, and of course, because I haven't eaten a lot of meat in a while, et, eaten, et, whatever, meat, in a long time, the chicken made me very sick, but I was all happy, and we were watching the best little whorehouse in Texas and really not getting into it, so I started playing this bass that was in their living room, and I actually picked out a few lines, so I think I've got some talent for it.
2082441	2088746	But I'm supposed to be getting one of these for my birthday, hint, hint, hint, which is next month, which still depresses me.
2090187	2097494	Um, but the rest of my week, I blew off school because I was just all, you know, whatever.
2098214	2101017	And then I decided that because, um...
2103166	2108149	For background, for people, I don't have a lot of free time, as in, I have no free time.
2109110	2114154	So I dropped a class so that I would not completely lose my sanity and my health.
2114914	2119938	I dropped Color Theory, also because going in that classroom makes me have headaches from acrylic paint fumes.
2120218	2120638	Fun, huh?
2121519	2125641	So I'm going to be taking it next spring and working part-time, blah blah blah.
2126622	2128884	Sometimes you have to make those sacrifices for your health.
2129345	2136692	Unfortunately, it's going to keep me in school for another, I'd say at least another semester.
2137733	2143959	So, and then that's really what my week has been, is me trying to decide whether or not I was going to drop that class.
2144299	2144839	And so I did.
2146281	2147742	I'm an academic failure.
2147762	2149764	I have a W on my transcript now.
2149904	2150525	Not a big deal.
2153417	2158603	The bass I'm looking at, by the way, is a OLP, either that or... I don't know.
2158983	2162106	Somebody posted a picture to my MySpace of a Bats Maru guitar.
2162226	2163107	That's so hardcore.
2163187	2167692	I know about the Bats Maru bass, and the ratings on it are not the best.
2168132	2170134	A couple of them that I'm looking at... But it's a Bats Maru bass.
2170154	2170775	Didn't we see that?
2170855	2171276	It was Hello Kitty.
2171296	2173698	You don't buy it because it looks good.
2174339	2176261	You buy it because it sounds good.
2176701	2177401	Whatever.
2177461	2178502	You and I have different priorities.
2178522	2181202	You can always paint it or finish it or put stickers on it or something.
2181222	2184083	You and I have painfully different priorities.
2187104	2189085	Alright, are we ready to get to the chatroom FUs?
2189365	2190605	Are you all wrapped up?
2191465	2193766	For the record, I'm not a vegetarian for ethical reasons.
2194426	2196447	I don't eat meat because it makes me sick.
2198167	2200368	Let's get to the chatroom FUs.
2201808	2203489	Send them over a private message.
2208246	2217988	MrBlackWolf would like to say F you to my Guitar Hero controller who decided last week that the green button was going to no longer work even though it looks just fine when I take it apart.
2218528	2218828	Yeah.
2222149	2229071	And Jaded2006 would like to say F you to my DDR pad sensor taking a crap last night in the middle of a game.
2229971	2231151	It's going to be nasty to step in.
2233796	2239021	Dark Knight would like to say F you to my job for being so freaking hot today.
2239462	2242545	And F you to me for not getting out more often and enjoy life.
2244227	2247390	Mikkel Tov would like to say F you to the new season of Power Rangers.
2247451	2250173	If it wasn't for the hot Green Ranger, the show would be worthless.
2252223	2262048	Phoenix would like to say F you to all the haters who downvote my YTMNDs and the people in chat who wanted to kick me because I shamelessly plugged my new YTMND.
2263248	2266230	Which he'll post the link in chatroom if you want to see that.
2266730	2267590	I'm not going to try and read it.
2267710	2268611	It's too many abbreviations.
2271592	2275414	Ryoma would like to say F you to security guards not letting me in the LJ's mosh.
2275994	2277595	LJ mofo, she it.
2279264	2283130	Sephiroth 1215 would like to say F you to Beatmania being a whopping $65.
2284612	2286535	Loki, why did we report it would be less?
2287958	2288318	What now?
2288759	2289320	Beatmania?
2289580	2290221	We said it was going to be $40.
2290782	2291243	What happened?
2291824	2292405	The price changed.
2292465	2293426	Didn't you read the forums?
2293947	2294288	I guess.
2296454	2297535	Not our fault.
2297835	2299096	Tiger Claw, I know, it happens.
2299196	2302178	Amazon was running the same thing for a while, so, you know, it wasn't just us.
2302218	2304559	I mean, they changed their mind on what they wanted to price it.
2304699	2305740	Well, poopy on you guys.
2306180	2309242	Alright, Tiger Claw would like to say F you to all the Captain N haters.
2310543	2317248	NintendoManiac64 would like to say F you to Slackware for not liking the non-normal video... I'm sorry, it's linking.
2318068	2321851	F you to Slackware for not linking the non-normal video card on the computer I was installing on.
2322291	2323412	And F you to Sony...
2326249	2335315	And Legend of Zaku would like to say F you to not being able to drink a bottle of Ramune really fast to qualify for a Ramune drinking contest in a small-time anime expo yesterday.
2335635	2337056	That'd have to make you belch.
2337316	2343119	And lastly, Ryoma would like to say F you to the stupid Judas Priest sticker not coming off my base.
2344280	2345541	Oh, we have one more late one.
2346261	2349303	RavensDolphin would like to say F you for $60 games.
2349924	2350544	Amen to that.
2351144	2352125	Freaking Xbox 360.
2352165	2354947	Removing Judas Priest stickers from your base does not make you any less gay.
2356121	2356701	Stop it.
2356721	2367387	Okay, now I'll have you know that Dynasty Warriors 5 Empires and Rockstar's Table Tennis are both coming out at $40 for the Xbox 360.
2367808	2368388	Whoopee!
2369168	2370189	Of course, both games are grand stock.
2372601	2373962	Okay, I think that's about it.
2374002	2374923	We're way over tonight.
2374963	2376564	We're supposed to be done with this shit at 9 o'clock.
2376604	2376884	It's 9.30 now.
2376964	2377805	I have homework to do.
2377825	2379306	It's because our first half ran so long.
2380407	2381467	Because we like to talk.
2381807	2383329	Final last super-duper thoughts.
2383349	2384009	Caffeine.
2384049	2384429	Bugged.
2384850	2385210	Caffeine?
2385370	2385770	Caffeine.
2385950	2386251	Loki.
2387351	2388272	Online play.
2388392	2388932	Cage match winner?
2390774	2394276	Cage match winner is... Caffeine.
2394396	2395577	Caffeine won everything!
2395917	2396598	Oh yeah, duh.
2396638	2397378	Like I had to look.
2397418	2398839	It was a landslide tonight, kids.
2399980	2400981	Did you even have to ask...
2402233	2411609	Chunky XL For their song about caffeine Tally Hall did get quite a bit of love but not enough unfortunately in the Ezoic They got true love!
2411709	2413472	Everybody forgot about the Ezoic apparently
2415056	2417637	I have to admit, though, the Junkie XL song's pretty good.
2417657	2420058	Compared to most Loki picks, it's pretty good.
2420418	2431203	Well, the Junkie XL one, I didn't have any Cage Munch picks, and we were asked to submit some more songs for rotation, so I've got some full-auto ones coming, too.
2431223	2435564	I'm not sure about anything else from Burnout, because it's all like butt rock to me.
2435905	2438186	We don't need to overdo it on the butt rock.
2440091	2443033	This is a special moment right now.
2443153	2443793	We'd like to take...
2469332	2474715	This time to tell all the kids at home, send your parents out of the room, this is a kid's song.
2476656	2480098	Life's gonna suck when you grow up, when you grow up, when you grow up.
2480118	2483679	Life's gonna suck when you grow up, it sucks pretty bad right now.
2484080	2486681	Hey, if you know the words, sing along!
2486921	2490403	You're gonna have to mow the lawn, do the dishes, make your bed.
2490603	2493384	You're gonna have to go to school until you're 17.
2494085	2496966	It's gonna seem about three times as long as that.
