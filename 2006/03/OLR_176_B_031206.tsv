405	5469	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
5810	14657	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15378	19061	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20021	21863	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
21903	24986	We're here on this March the 12th of 2006 with episode number 176.
26889	37894	We had a pretty exciting first half there, talking about all sorts of stuff, the new PSP, talking about patching on the Xbox 360, and we're going to kick off this segment with some more news going over to the Xbox 360.
37974	38315	Loki?
39175	47179	Yeah, they're saying there's a story going out on most of the gaming sites out there about foil and how it ruined the 360.
48320	50421	Apparently on the graphics processor...
51954	54415	HeatSync, there is a foil layer left on there.
55076	66743	And one of the German sites out there on the Xbox scene forums, he actually opened up his 360 to show that the foil was still on there.
67303	78069	And saying that the foil left on there on the heat transfer pad is basically acting like a skillet, I guess, instead of a heat sink.
78890	79210	So...
80799	91707	Basically, that's kind of backing up the whole heat sink over the GPU overheating and that's what caused the Xbox 360s to stop working.
92588	93368	Yeah, I know that one.
94049	95890	Do you think Microsoft is going to replace that one?
97612	100474	Well, here's basically... No, the guy that cracked it open.
101154	101734	Oh, no, no.
103376	106438	Basically, there's a follow-up by Microsoft and they've
107587	117914	The video posted by the German blog GamesStore24.de shows the thermal interface pads that are installed per specification.
117994	127181	This foil eliminates the need of a protective liner, which simplifies the final assembly process and minimizes shipping concerns and contamination issues.
127201	129022	No, I thought it enhanced it.
138223	140004	I thought opening it up in it was full of cookies.
140184	142205	I thought that let the gnomes come out to play.
142946	143746	Stop looking at my shirt!
145387	146728	I love your underpants gnome shirt.
147128	147428	Thank you.
148009	153231	Now, the whole thing is, is it, you know, is the foil actually causing this thing to overheat?
154032	154452	We don't know.
154752	155813	That's what it comes down to.
155913	160035	It's just another article out there because... It gives better heat spread so you can cook better.
161116	164578	Now, I personally think that it doesn't because...
165891	173458	I guess if you had something on, you know, most of the time like for CPUs and stuff when you're talking like an actual PC, you have thermal paste in between.
174179	182226	Some manufacturers will use foil instead because it also allows heat transfer from the CPU to the heatsink.
182686	186390	Well, if this foil got in the way of that, it possibly could, you know,
187873	188193	and so on.
209963	210564	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
229604	230205	Maybe.
230265	231926	I mean, it's kind of take this with a grain of salt.
232006	242434	But the Chinese website MyDrivers has reported that a Taiwan manufacturer, Compec, has received the orders from Sony to start producing the PCB.
242694	244336	I'm sorry, the HDI PCB.
244376	245997	This would be the printed circuit board.
246357	247397	for the PlayStation 3.
247477	254360	There is no official announcement from Compaq, but the rumor says that this is going into production June or July of this year.
255260	265683	If you are taking this with a grain of salt, just know that MyDrivers is a pretty reputable Chinese website, but don't take anybody's word for it until you hear it from Sony directly, I suppose.
266323	272065	But the PlayStation 3 sounds like it may be on its way after all, at least the first few steps to getting that done.
273468	275249	And let's go over to a Nintendo story.
275289	275749	Why not?
276070	278351	DarkSakura, what's new on the Nintendo DS?
278991	279592	A bunch of stuff.
280312	283394	But in this particular, there's a new RPG on the way for the DS.
284395	292619	It's called Contact, and it's a game about hunting, cooking, fishing, training, collecting, and romance.
293360	294240	Whoa, hold on a second.
294601	296362	Hunting, training, fishing, all that stuff.
296842	297362	Organtrail.
297642	298363	Organtrail with love.
307053	308914	You play as someone named Terry.
309354	312876	You meet a professor whose spaceship has crashed on a weirdo planet.
313997	316759	You have to collect cells, which are the power source for the ship.
317019	318540	They're all over the place, so you have to go find them.
320161	323943	As you're going, you train animals, collect items, play a bunch of mini-games.
324343	325804	There's real-time combat.
326084	326445	There's...
328639	331761	An online version, but they haven't said anything about how that's going to work.
331881	336803	It's being produced by Goichi Suda, who is the director of Killer7.
337763	343686	And the characters were designed by Atsuko Fukushima of Popolo Cross.
344327	345107	That makes me happy.
346910	353092	There is actually an official site up for it too, and it's going to be published by Atlas in the US.
354312	369596	No UK release date stated as of yet, although they know that it's in development by Marvelous Interactive, and Rising Star tends to bring over their games in Europe, so there's hope for our European audience.
371016	371316	All right.
371636	376298	The artwork, I have to say, though, after looking through the Japanese site, it is pretty awesome.
376458	377258	I'm looking forward to it.
377959	378399	Sounds cool.
379159	385782	Loki, we touched on some new stuff on Xbox Live during the first half of the show, but set the record straight for us.
385842	386982	What's going on on Xbox Live?
387883	390304	A couple new things are coming out, actually.
391417	397142	Ridge Racer 6 demo is now on Xbox Live so you can also check that out as well.
410251	414895	Not a big fan of those type of games like The Outfit, but I'll probably check it out because, hey, it's free.
414975	419818	And I heard our buddies over at All Games are really into it, and I was listening to their show, and they seem really into it.
419838	423301	The whole thing reminds me of kind of like G.I.
423341	427584	Joe, sort of the whole... Well, when you put it that way, it sounds kind of cool.
427604	428625	Well, now you know.
428745	437392	The way The Outfit is, I mean, because it's kind of like this, you know, over-exaggerated, like, World War II action game where you can call in, like,
438136	447322	I heard that you kind of control a team of four.
447642	449163	And I like games where I get to be the boss.
449763	451764	So, you know, maybe I will have to check it out.
452665	457828	Even though war games are usually not my type of thing, or battle, whatever the hell, I'll give it a fair shot.
457908	462571	Hell, I tried Battlefield 2, which is so not my kind of game, and I was very lost when I played it, but, you know...
462998	463638	Gotta try it.
464279	465540	Can't knock it till you tried it, right?
465660	468682	You left yourself way open for a joke and I chose not to speak it right there.
469943	472145	What right do you have being on this show tonight?
472185	473005	Are you even a gamer?
474646	474886	I am.
475407	475767	Oh, okay.
476327	477288	What was the last game you played?
477728	478629	Diablo 2, like I said.
478769	479850	Okay, but new game.
481491	481871	Burnout?
482332	483292	Oh yeah, Burnout Legends.
483453	483953	Alright, fine.
484453	485254	I'm just giving you a hard time.
485794	486495	Bug's my buddy.
486815	488176	I've known him forever.
488196	488456	17 years.
488656	489617	I had to put up with your shit.
489717	490137	Ah, shut up.
490157	490337	Alright.
490357	491058	I had to put up with mine.
492017	495579	So Loki, going back over to you, what do you got on Silent Hill?
496480	498922	They're working on the Silent Hill 3 team.
499582	503425	They're working on a new project for PlayStation 3.
504345	504606	Duh.
505266	508508	So like Silent Hill 5, most likely, or maybe something different?
509629	509889	Yeah.
510510	511590	We just know they're working.
511630	512451	They're hard at work again.
513328	517110	Yeah, that... And tomorrow the sun will come out!
517170	530779	I mean, seriously, how stupid of a story... It's the third release of Silent Hill 2 for the... They're making another in a really successful franchise that has a movie coming out that's probably going to be one of the first video game movies that's actually good.
530919	532239	It's going to be Final Hill.
532259	533260	They're making a sequel?
533340	535121	Oh my god, that's such a shocker!
536682	537323	Did you know what?
537843	538683	Mario Bros.
538723	541065	is going to be on The Revolution when that comes out too!
542992	545436	In Halo 3, it's coming out on the Xbox 360.
545756	546918	Whoa, shocker.
547859	548701	Okay, seriously.
549582	553368	All right, look, it was making the rounds on game sites, so we have to report it.
554289	557574	All right, do you have something else then, Loki, that might be more worthy of our time?
558829	559249	Maybe.
561569	562150	Actually, yes.
562190	566730	Sega is developing a PlayStation 3 launch title, and what would you think?
566950	567731	And you know what?
567751	570071	The sun's going to set tomorrow, duh.
570751	571271	No, it's not.
571551	575792	Yeah, but how many golf games does Sega make?
576532	578532	Oh, snap.
578552	579953	They don't make mo-cap.
580033	581293	And plus, you know what?
581333	582373	I don't care how long it's been.
582433	585854	It is still weird to hear of Sega making games for other consoles.
585974	586794	I don't care how long it's been.
586814	587294	It's still weird.
588555	595897	Yes, they're currently developing a golf game, and actually it's two golf games, I should say.
598277	604278	Doesn't sound that exciting to me, but I don't know, maybe it's Sonic Golf or something.
606919	610420	I'm sorry, just like everything attached to Sega is just always Sonic.
612280	614901	Maybe Ooh La La's Sexy Golf would be awesome.
615161	616481	Or Crazy Taxi Golf.
618612	620453	Let's make some crazy par!
620854	625857	Alright, DarkSakura is going to try and bring us back to Sanity World.
625937	626718	Oh, who am I kidding?
626758	631442	It's her website of the week, and you know it's going to be just as crazy as the rest of what we've been talking about this evening?
631462	636585	No, it's a serious and important, relevant site that affects everybody's life.
636746	637706	Alright, cue the theme music?
637866	638107	Yes.
642810	647413	Today's website of the week is www.cheese.com
648447	651008	Yes, the number one resource about cheese.
652549	662114	To quote from the website, cheese is nutritious food made mostly from the milk of cows, but also other mammals, including sheep, goats, buffalo, reindeer, camels, and yaks.
662794	666416	About 4,000 years ago, people started to breed animals and process their milk.
666756	668257	That's when cheese was born.
669058	676341	You can search the database of 654 cheeses by name, country of origin, type of milk used to produce it, or by texture.
676762	677482	What about head cheese?
678311	684353	Headcheese is actually the brains of a cow.
684473	686053	I know, but does it have information about that?
686994	688414	I think it's talking about dairy cheese.
689474	690315	No, Flamanda Cheese then.
691355	691655	Huh.
692235	692875	Flamanda Cheese.
696336	697057	I watch Red Dwarf.
697857	698297	Yeah.
703197	708559	If anybody found Orange Lounge Radio's on-topicness for this episode, could you please email us?
708579	709899	Because we seem to have lost it.
711040	714441	Some of the cheeses listed on this site, we have... I believe it's behind the caffeine.
714881	719503	Air Del Cheese, we have American Cheese, which is really crap.
721503	725244	Atun Cheese, we have Babybel, which actually is one of my favorites.
725805	726825	Basket Cheese!
728035	728435	Carameldansen
759560	760902	Oh, I think I found the on-topic.
760922	761283	Here we go.
763334	767677	This new game, Galactic Civilizations 2, it's actually a little bit different.
767777	768357	It just came out.
768857	783065	A little different in the digital rights management of the way the game is set up because the license of the game allows you to install the game onto as many machines as you want to, that you own, as long as only one copy is being used at once.
783165	791430	Their thought behind this, how many sales are lost because people want to have a game on their laptop and desktop, but they don't want to have to buy multiple CDs for that.
791730	797455	and, you know, being a laptop and desktop owner, you know, I kind of like games like Warcraft that I can put on both of them, so that's kind of interesting.
799358	805143	But the other side of that is this company called Starforce, which is an anti-piracy developer.
805624	807486	And they kind of struck a low blow.
807506	824661	A story here on 1up.com that was run earlier this week saying that Starforce, what they did, they actually posted on their company message boards, again, Starforce makes the anti-piracy software, by an admin, and they put a link in the post to a torrent file for Galactic Civilizations 2.
825522	828284	Why would an anti-piracy company be linking torrents?
828684	834549	Well, saying in the post, right now, several thousands of people are downloading the pirated version only from that website.
834849	835829	Is it good for the sales?
836050	836570	Unlikely.
837030	847698	So in other words, it was kind of like a bully tactic, in a way, because they're an anti-piracy company, and they're saying that, oh, this company didn't use our software, and here's their game being rampantly pirated, and how dare they sue them?
848739	849579	I don't know what could happen.
849619	851521	Of course, the post is gone now.
852682	862089	And Galactic Civilizations 2 did publish a response saying, Our primary weapon to fight piracy is through rewarding customers through convenient, frequent, free updates.
862429	871296	If you make it easy for users to buy and make full use of your product or service legitimately, then we believe you'll gain more users from that convenience than you'll lose from piracy.
871816	876460	Very interesting and rebellious stance from this company that I think is very customer-driven.
877140	878520	I gotta say, kind of neat.
879021	882421	Like Starforce needed any more negative publicity, seriously.
882941	883522	What else have they done?
883702	884802	I'm not very familiar with that company.
884822	885802	They're really bad.
886562	898685	As far as the techs that they use, I think they're one of the companies that had spyware thrown on your PC that basically monitors what you're running, that type of thing.
899185	900906	I'm pretty sure that was the same company.
902106	902806	Interesting, so...
903632	905113	They're on the naughty list this week.
907034	912096	We got Galactic Civilizations 2 on the nice list for their outside-the-box thinking on their policy there.
913176	914657	Loki, what else is being developed?
915717	927102	This company called Bigfoot Networks has actually just gotten some money to develop what they're saying is going to be the end of all lag.
927502	928503	Lag is gone.
928523	930744	They're developing, I guess, hardware that's going to be
931849	936451	Use it in conjunction with online games or God knows what, and it will end lag.
936852	942074	Apparently, I don't know, it sounds interesting.
942314	944635	It's one of those I'll believe it when I see it type things.
945276	945696	Definitely.
945716	953140	Hooray for the idea that somebody's going to try and fix the lag problems, but can you really know?
953420	953780	I don't know.
955381	956341	I'll believe it when I see it.
956361	957402	It's just like, you know...
959144	959384	DarkSakura
987027	987228	What?!
989910	990851	Sorry, Miss Thing.
991691	998677	You have some updates, well, not updates, but an interesting story on some games that were never released, but maybe should have been?
999117	1003441	To quote this title, which I think is perfect, cut down in their prime.
1004062	1004682	What website's this?
1004822	1007384	The Best Games That Never Were, from GameCloud.
1007625	1007825	Okay.
1007845	1009186	Um...
1010074	1013175	Here's just a list of various games that have been cancelled.
1013275	1019978	One was Babylon 5 Into the Fire, cancelled September 1998, which was basically a big space simulator.
1021539	1027941	It would have used some filmed content from the TV actors, but it was just dragging along for the development, so they axed it.
1030779	1033801	XCOM Genesis XCOM Alliance
1059156	1060797	Again, another victim of Hasbro.
1061838	1064619	Daikatana 2, 1999.
1065359	1066540	Games that should have been cut.
1068221	1069902	Amen, The Awakening, January 2000.
1070702	1073324	It was a first-person shooter at Cave Dog.
1075785	1084070	There was an E3 demo at 1999, had a lot of interactive features, but they, well, had money issues and boop, down it went.
1084510	1086831	So they focused on Total Annihilation and then closed down.
1087692	1087832	Hmm.
1088812	1094934	Ultima Worlds Online canceled March 2001.
1097154	1110778	It was by Origin and EA to create a sequel to the first Ultima to do sort of like a sci-fi fantasy thing, but they didn't want to pull people off of the original Ultima Online, so they
1111443	1119765	Interesting, because then years later, of course, you have EverQuest 2 doing battle with EverQuest 1 in a way, because people who built up their characters on EverQuest 1 didn't want to leave.
1120105	1123626	So it's kind of like they saw this with Ultima years ago.
1123706	1124446	So it's kind of interesting.
1124986	1128187	Another game canceled was Simsville, September 2001.
1130087	1135328	Maxis announced it in 2000 as a mix of The Sims and SimCity.
1137329	1137569	But...
1139801	1145365	I actually have an old copy of SimCity 3000 that has a promo material for it.
1146386	1149969	It was like, wow, this looks like it'd be interesting, but I don't know how the hell they're going to pull it off.
1150129	1152230	Dude, Bug, do you remember when we used to play SimAnt?
1153091	1153271	Yes.
1153311	1154192	That game was the shit.
1154252	1155052	The bright yellow ant.
1155413	1156053	The game was awesome.
1156073	1160516	But pretty much instead of doing that, they did The Sims Online and then went on to Sims 2.
1161417	1163979	Which probably was better, worked out better for them.
1164559	1165400	Then we had TORN.
1166147	1167748	July 2001, it was cancelled.
1167948	1173270	It was from Interplay's Black Isle Studios that would have used the Liftec engine.
1174631	1175151	Hyped up.
1175511	1176051	Cancelled down.
1177212	1179873	Because especially Interplay hasn't done a game in two years.
1181513	1182894	Duke Nukem Endangered Species.
1183154	1184515	Cancelled 2001.
1186635	1188696	Basically because they're working on Duke Nukem Forever.
1189257	1192818	But they were... Which we're still waiting on!
1192878	1193298	Hello!
1193318	1193358	Um...
1195788	1203231	But there was a message by the 3D Realms CEO on the Planet Crap message board.
1203251	1205032	That's the best name ever, Planet Crap.
1206093	1210334	This was a game we had to give our publisher in order to get a very sweet deal in another area.
1211195	1212976	We've since talked them out of it.
1213016	1213536	That's the quote.
1216711	1219972	To answer some questions from chat room, www.orangelondrader.com.
1220032	1222773	Phoenix wants to know, why are we talking about games that were canceled in 2000-2001?
1223533	1227254	Because the list is the best of all time, or best games that were never, I don't know.
1227274	1227694	And there's more.
1227894	1228254	All time.
1229275	1230435	Give us real quickly what's left.
1230775	1233336	Sam & Max Freelance Police canceled March 2004.
1233876	1234896	Trinity in 2003.
1236577	1239717	It was sort of a response to Return to Castle Wolfenstein.
1240418	1242378	SWAT Urban Justice canceled 2003.
1242918	1243979	Mythica, February 2004.
1245319	1248741	Ultimate X Odyssey 2004, Black 9 sometime in 2003.
1250942	1252403	Interesting feedback from our chat room.
1252443	1254985	I think they were starting to shout out some other games that came to mind.
1255065	1257486	Ryoma says the Zelda demo with Ganon.
1258146	1259948	I guess a while back there was that demo.
1262449	1265131	Was it on GameCube, that first demo that they had?
1265651	1268252	I'm trying to remember which one he's referencing because there's a couple that come to mind there.
1268713	1274516	Spirit Snare says they canceled Nintendo Puzzle Collection, Panel de Pon forever, but they released Pokemon Channel instead.
1275748	1276168	Interesting.
1277368	1288071	Oh, and Ryoma and GK128 are joining in, and EarthBound64, but GK128 pointing out EarthBound64 was canned, but it came back on the GBA in Japan.
1288651	1293712	And of course, one that I can interject as well, remember the Final Fantasy VI in 3D demo?
1294012	1297653	A very brief demo that was on Nintendo 64 or something, and drove the fanboys crazy.
1297673	1299173	I've actually still been trying to hunt that down.
1299734	1301214	I saw it ages ago.
1301334	1301574	Really?
1302474	1304475	They're an emulation site.
1304496	1308838	Actually, the guy who did, and this was another game I was actually interested in was Robotech Crystal Dreams.
1309879	1318063	The developer of that game actually has the ROM for it up on his website and his 3D models available.
1318303	1320324	I'll see if I can hunt that down for folks in the chat room.
1321025	1321245	Pretty cool.
1322079	1328041	Alright, well, one thing that people have been waiting a little while to see a game made out of this is Family Guy.
1328822	1335264	That's right, High Voltage Software is going to be developing a Family Guy game for Take-Two Entertainment.
1335984	1342407	They're going to be doing some video games there based on Family Guy, and I'm assuming that it's actually going to be multi-platform?
1343027	1364701	I think I read somewhere near it's multi-platform so you're probably going to see I would say it's probably going to be a very similar deal to what you see with like the Simpsons games but hopefully better games than what we got with the Simpsons games because there were only a couple like Hit and Run was okay but you know most of the Simpsons games were kind of poopy the good old arcade game oh well yeah the arcade game it owns everything but you know
1365427	1367848	I personally want to see another arcade game.
1367868	1369088	Is this Family Guy jumping the shark, though?
1394266	1402033	I think it's, I wouldn't really want my, you know, I wouldn't really want to see a Family Guy game just because I'm afraid of what they'd do with it.
1402753	1405896	But if it's done right, then hell yeah.
1406016	1417086	Ryoma in our chat room at OrangeHuntTrader.com says, it's going to be Peter farting, Stewie cursing, Brian drinking, Chris whining, Meg also whining, Lois cleaning up after everyone's crap, and Quagmire being generally horny.
1417386	1418327	So it'll just be the show.
1419619	1421600	There should be a Quagmire game.
1421761	1423282	It's Quagmire!
1423362	1425824	Xander C says, you know what they need to make a video game out of?
1426244	1426944	Orange Lounge Radio.
1428365	1432509	Didn't we have somebody a while back that was going to make a text adventure game based on Orange Lounge Radio or something?
1432749	1433910	We need our own RPG.
1434710	1437672	Seriously, we need to fire up RPG Creator and make something.
1437772	1439013	It'll be interesting.
1439113	1440134	It's harder than it sounds.
1440274	1440514	I know.
1441315	1442236	Hey, you know what, guys?
1442296	1445818	If you want to do something like that and get our eternal worship, go for it.
1446099	1447740	We'll put it on our MySpace or something.
1447760	1448020	Who knows?
1449832	1452253	Alright, moving on to another story.
1452693	1461277	Let's go on over to Loki, who has another possible movie jump in the... Exactly.
1461757	1468119	Well, you know, Quentin Tarantino in video games, that's something you don't really hear that often.
1468220	1469380	Please say Kill Bill the game.
1470617	1470797	No.
1470917	1471218	Damn.
1471318	1472039	Kill Bill the Game?
1472079	1472240	No.
1472260	1478131	The theme of this year's game is coming out are old, classic, violent movies made into games.
1478191	1482799	Like you have The Godfather, Scarface, and now Reservoir Dogs.
1483228	1483448	Yes.
1483788	1484889	Reservoir Dogs the game.
1484949	1486830	Reservoir Dogs the game.
1487490	1490512	So lots of cursing, shooting, and black and white.
1490932	1496395	It's going to be based on the movie and being developed by Blitz Games.
1496795	1512884	It's going to be primarily a third-person shooter, but we'll incorporate some driving elements as well as the torture scene where Michael Madsen reprises his role of Mr. Blonde and cuts
1514536	1518538	3rd person shooter involving some driving Why does NARC come to mind for some crazy reason?
1518558	1519579	You know what comes to mind for me?
1519639	1529404	Enter the Matrix Oh, that's kind of weird Because it involves driving and shooting I don't like Enter the Matrix Again, is this jumping the shark?
1529864	1534066	Probably It's just a trend, I mean, it's just like Scarface Into the shark
1535972	1540394	Just like Jaws, speaking of jumping the shark, the Jaws game is coming out later this year.
1540474	1544056	Somebody was just telling me about that game the other night, that they're eagerly awaiting that game.
1544076	1545857	Jaws jumped the shark when Jaws 2 came out.
1545977	1547377	How about Jaws 3D?
1547558	1553841	With Jaws, they actually have a dismemberment engine, and you can dismember people in 25 different places.
1553901	1554901	Do you play as the shark?
1555001	1555882	You play as the shark.
1555902	1556762	Oh, no, that's pretty cool.
1556802	1557483	Where have you been?
1558683	1559784	I told you.
1559824	1561425	It's cool.
1562185	1563446	Well, no, they showed it at E3.
1563486	1564807	I could have sworn we went and looked at it.
1564827	1567929	No, I didn't go look at that because I was busy whoring myself out to Sega.
1567949	1570111	It's like Echo the Dolphin on rabies.
1574634	1575895	I was in the line for the PS3.
1575935	1576936	That's where I was.
1577116	1577716	All right, all right.
1579037	1579758	Moving on.
1580318	1581199	Did you guys hear this?
1582460	1585582	In China, they are rising up and starting a revolution.
1588656	1595241	Game Unions have threatened to quit playing World of Warcraft because it has to do with unstable servers, and it's just going crazy.
1595581	1599164	Now, it's important to note that Blizzard really doesn't oversee the servers.
1599224	1606450	In China, it's actually maintained by a company called The9, and they charge gamers by the hour to play World of Warcraft.
1606971	1608552	I almost said World of Warcraft, sorry.
1608872	1609773	World of Warcraft.
1610553	1611674	I like the game, don't get me wrong.
1612175	1612255	Um...
1613323	1620725	The Nine is having a lot of problems solving technical issues related to the game, and they're not seeking Blizzard's help all the time there.
1621065	1626087	Gamers are getting pissed off at severe time delays, long queue times, and frozen server.
1627047	1635189	Right now, WoW has about 530,000 players on it, and they're about ready to just rise up and quit playing the game.
1635209	1636210	They're going to vote with their wallets.
1636790	1637030	Wow.
1639861	1640742	DarkSakura, what's going on in the UK?
1640762	1641523	There's a few things.
1641543	1643125	There is a zombie MMO on its way by Thinking Man Studios.
1662412	1666654	It's a survival horror MMORPG that lets you play either as a human or a flesh-eating zombie.
1667414	1672156	It's titled Exanimus, which is Latin for without life for people who don't know that.
1672436	1674957	Is there a button for yelling brains?
1675397	1679558	I don't think a zombie would really have the mental capacity to be able to say brains.
1679598	1681959	They just go like that.
1682642	1687547	You should be able to expect to see half-rotten corpses walking around tearing apart the bodies of the living for food.
1704734	1712338	There is a website that's stating it will be competitively priced to other MMOs currently on the market.
1712658	1720142	The game is only in development for the PC, but for a Max, Xbox 360, or PS3 version, they say you never know.
1720202	1724444	With technology always changing, we are always interested in finding new outlets for people to play.
1724924	1731307	No yet word of a release date, no screenshots out, but there is a site, and I'll be linking it to our chat room shortly.
1733214	1735795	I personally want to play as a zombie so I can go around eating people.
1737676	1739597	You know, tearing off limbs, beating them with it.
1739617	1740238	Shaun of the Dead.
1740418	1740778	Oh, yeah.
1741158	1742699	We need Shaun of the Dead the game.
1743039	1744500	That's actually a brilliant idea.
1746161	1749742	Next up, Sony is removing PSP posters.
1750643	1760388	It's a particular poster that advises consumers to take a running jump from tram and train stations across the country after transport staff expressed safety concerns.
1761841	1766464	The poster was part of a recent advertising campaign to promote the PSP in the UK.
1766685	1769967	It featured a plain white background with red text that said, Take a running jump from here.
1771108	1777152	There's been actually a bunch of other ones that are kind of teasing at the changes that are being made with the PSP.
1777212	1781716	Remember the ones we mentioned a couple weeks ago about pictures and stuff?
1782916	1783277	Interesting.
1783477	1783597	Hmm.
1784147	1786429	Well, a little bit more on this.
1786489	1796317	A rail worker saw the poster to Tram Platform at Metrolink's Manchester Piccadilly Station and decided there was a safety issue and tried to have it covered.
1797198	1799240	They saw it, said it looked inappropriate.
1800180	1809088	And to quote on here, the message goes completely against all of our safety messages, particularly because PlayStation is aimed at youngsters and we are constantly telling them not to trespass.
1809769	1814429	So Sony has taken steps down to remove the posters from the tram stations.
1817373	1819074	Lastly, guess what we've got?
1819795	1824078	We have release dates, which would be nice if this Battle for Middle-Earth ad wouldn't cover half of them.
1827560	1829461	Let's see, let's see.
1830762	1832343	We have actually had releases.
1833104	1836106	Since we have passed the 10th, I'm going to go ahead and move on to the 14th.
1836566	1840188	Metal Gear Solid 3 Subsistence on PS2 on the 14th.
1840909	1846973	17th, 24, The Game, Ankh, Atelier Iris, Eternal Mana, Burnout Revenge.
1847553	1859357	Buzz, The Big Quiz, Driver Parallel Lines, Finding Nemo, JamesBun007 from Russia with Love, LA Rush, Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe, Onimusha, Dawn of Dreams, Sonic Riders.
1860017	1861318	They're just not getting Sonic Riders?
1862478	1862698	Okay.
1863799	1867820	The Outfit, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, Worms.
1869400	1870001	So, yeah.
1870581	1870881	Sweet.
1871823	1874406	Loki, anything we should be looking forward to in the U.S.
1874426	1874966	to follow that up?
1875447	1877508	Yeah, there's actually some pretty cool stuff coming out this week.
1877548	1881332	Driver Parallel Lines coming out on PlayStation 2 and Xbox.
1881692	1884454	It's supposed to not suck, but we'll see.
1885315	1888498	Metal Gear Solid 3 Subsistence, of course, really awesome.
1889179	1895284	And if you're into kids' games, I guess Ice Age 2 The Meltdown.
1896461	1897302	Oh, to match the movie.
1897702	1899423	Well, yeah, the movie's coming out later this year.
1900744	1902645	But, I don't know.
1904106	1905307	Not too much else coming out.
1905347	1906667	What have you heard about 24, The Game?
1906707	1907668	I'm kind of curious about this.
1907708	1912771	Even though I've fallen behind on watching the actual show, just because I really haven't watched a lot of TV recently.
1913972	1918274	The shows I used to watch all the time, I'll admit, I watch Survivor every week.
1918615	1920296	I haven't been watching it, like, nothing.
1920616	1921556	It's really weird.
1921576	1921616	Um...
1923092	1924516	But how's 24 the game supposed to be?
1924537	1925319	Have you heard anything about this?
1925439	1926623	I know the reviews weren't that great.
1927245	1927566	Really?
1928268	1928649	That's too bad.
1930358	1936699	This is going to seem really random, but of course we are an interactive show, and sometimes the chatroom is going to dictate the way we go on the show here.
1936939	1946201	Phoenix in our chatroom at OrangeMonterey.com says, This kid at my school got caught wanking in the bathroom to porn on his PSP, in response to the PSP bit that DarkSakura had to say.
1946441	1948822	But that made me think of this clip that's going around the internet this week.
1948842	1949502	Have you guys seen this?
1949542	1958584	The guy that's playing World of Warcraft, and the friends sneak up on him, and he's wanking to the sexy night elf dancing, the female night elf.
1958604	1959704	Have you guys seen this on YouTube?
1959964	1960204	No.
1960304	1962284	Where have you been posting?
1988564	1998811	worldofwank.com, Loki, you also have another worldly story for us.
1999511	2002513	Yes, it's interesting.
2003134	2009198	Basically, Nintendo is going to suit the Dutch.
2010692	2011913	What do they do this time?
2012053	2013674	Everyone's always picking on the Dutch, you know?
2013694	2014494	Hey, I'm half Dutch.
2015014	2017335	My husband's Dutch, and you know what his grandfather says?
2017976	2019296	If you ain't Dutch, you ain't much.
2019997	2023819	Well, I know I use a stage name on this show, but if you know my real last name, it's very Dutch.
2023999	2026560	So, you know, you can kind of tell.
2026820	2038906	Basically, long story short, they did a political ad for one of the politicians running, and of course, parodying Mario Brothers, so...
2040356	2043479	Wait, so why are they suing the political party over this?
2043919	2044740	Because it's a Dutch.
2045921	2047022	Wait, wait, run this by me again.
2047102	2047642	What happened?
2048203	2059112	Political party did an advertisement, I guess bashing one of their competitors or whatever, running, using like a Mario Brothers type of thing.
2059553	2060073	Oh, okay.
2060313	2060694	I get it.
2061134	2062135	Do we have a clip or anything?
2062495	2062615	No.
2063416	2063857	It's a Dutch.
2063937	2064317	Well, damn.
2065509	2071394	Alright, well, I guess it's nice to know that there's many sue-happy companies in the gaming industry.
2071434	2071714	Who knows?
2072534	2074196	What about parody and all that stuff?
2074256	2076157	Can't you... Well, I don't know.
2076197	2077498	I guess that's an American thing.
2077518	2080921	I don't know about Dutch law, but shouldn't there be room for fair parody and all that stuff?
2081421	2083263	No, not when you're talking about Mario Brothers.
2083383	2084043	I guess not.
2084123	2084423	Sheesh.
2084484	2085524	Parody and satire.
2085925	2086365	I found it.
2087386	2088868	God of War 2 It's Coming Out
2101880	2104922	Yes, that's pretty much all we have to say about that at this time.
2104962	2109925	It is coming out and actually Game Informer magazine actually has some screens from it.
2110045	2112886	Also, something to note, it is coming out for PlayStation 2.
2114227	2116769	So it's not going to be for PS3.
2116789	2122552	That's pretty awesome, except I haven't got my freaking Game Informer magazine issues in the last three months.
2123412	2124053	Damn them.
2124393	2125013	Why, what happened?
2126134	2127275	Stupid people.
2127295	2129616	I don't know, they just don't freaking...
2131701	2132741	DarkSakura, are you ready to get your hate on?
2132761	2135062	Yeah, although this Dutch thing is really funny.
2160353	2170677	I'd have to say that my FU of the week goes towards, I would have to say the whole American work ethic.
2171297	2171537	Yeah.
2172617	2182061	As in, well, not necessarily the work ethic, but the attitude that corporations, different companies place on overworking employees, you know?
2183021	2189203	I think it's in the Netherlands that the government has mandatory four weeks paid vacations.
2189921	2192122	We're here, what are we given, what, 10 days?
2192682	2193002	15 days?
2193423	2194043	Something like that.
2194523	2195844	And that's including sick time.
2196884	2198765	Yet, they're just as productive as we are.
2199546	2200046	So, yeah.
2200446	2207769	That's, uh, you know, they wonder why we have the highest, uh, you know, amount of, uh, stress leave granted to employees.
2207849	2209130	It's because they're burning us out!
2210471	2211251	So take a vacation.
2213192	2213472	Alright.
2213492	2214332	Is that it?
2214733	2216954	Yeah, that's been my FU of the entire week.
2216974	2217494	Alright, Loki.
2217514	2217614	Loki.
2219012	2227521	Ah, fuck you to the full auto multiplayer servers and for the people that constantly disconnect mid-race because they're losing and they suck.
2228862	2234307	It makes it really hard for me to get these last two achievements if people keep quitting the races and they're not counting.
2234327	2236009	Give me a 360, I'll help you with that.
2238603	2242184	I want to give an FU to movie prices, because that's really why I haven't been to the movies in forever.
2242244	2254768	Let's see, I can pay $9.25 to go see a movie in the theater, or I can pay less than twice that to get a Netflix account and watch movies on my pretty HDTV.
2256269	2257069	Bug, do you have any FUs?
2259570	2264371	I'm just a few to not having a job still since May, but I do have an interview this week.
2264391	2265211	You want to make your plea?
2265231	2267252	We have a lot of people listening to the show, maybe some in the Bay Area.
2268294	2269555	What are your qualifications?
2269855	2270435	Unix admin.
2270655	2271916	All right.
2271956	2274577	If you want to offer Bugged a job, send us an email.
2274657	2277778	With real money, not... He's actually a really smart computer guy.
2277798	2281280	You know how everybody has that friend that they call when they need their computer fixed?
2281560	2282100	That's Bugged.
2282460	2284041	I call Bugged when Loki's not available.
2284321	2287162	No, I just... It really depends on what the issue is.
2287242	2288663	Bugged, I call for most of my issues.
2289363	2291064	Also, I had one more I forgot.
2292185	2296389	FU to my work for blocking all internet access except for a few select sites.
2296789	2303094	And this is not really... I understand why they're doing it because there's a lot of people slacking off at work and going on MySpace and stuff like that.
2304275	2312982	But the problem is it's also the sites I use for my information on games and stuff and to update our inter-office forms and stuff is being blocked.
2313082	2316305	And I have to constantly email them, like for example IGN.
2317116	2323208	You don't really understand how many subdomains there are to IGN until you actually have it blocked and try to have them unblock it.
2323248	2326956	There's like 60 different domains on there and they have to unblock all of them.
2327426	2332712	And they're arguably saying, oh, some of these are for ads, and we don't want to unlock two ads.
2332952	2334494	Well, then I don't get pictures on that site.
2334554	2336216	And GameSpot, same thing.
2336516	2342262	I don't have pictures on the site anymore, and all the site formatting is all messed up now because they blocked all this stuff.
2342282	2342823	Can't get the CSS.
2343103	2349490	And also, the other thing, too, they blocked all search engines, so if you're looking for information that might not be on those sites, oh, you're screwed.
2349770	2352792	How about instead of blocking the entire internet, they just block MySpace?
2353352	2365399	Or maybe they should just block the sites that they don't want people to go to, which I've insisted they do in the first place, but the conspiracy theory around the office is they're doing it to make work uncomfortable so people will leave.
2366880	2368721	Now, can you still play Solitaire on the computers?
2369481	2369761	Yeah.
2370042	2372043	Well, what did they fix there?
2372123	2373804	Just make sure you don't play when the governor comes through.
2374656	2384244	What they did in my work is there's actually a corporate software that they can have go in with Internet Explorer that blocks certain sites registered as a certain type.
2384665	2386086	Exactly, and that's what they did in this site.
2386106	2391150	But they blocked even stuff that was registered as movies slash TV, which is our business.
2391330	2392371	I mean, come on.
2392912	2401339	But it's just gotten to a ridiculous level, and they've taken this whole back-asswards approach to try to solve the problem and...
2402408	2404809	You know how I know that we made it, though, in the business.
2404849	2412532	OrangeLonsRadio.com finally got blocked by WebSense at one point for being like an internet fan club or something.
2412612	2414593	I can still access it at work.
2414813	2421656	But I couldn't access it at one of our vendor companies because I guess they have a high level of restriction on WebSense.
2422356	2423517	And we get picked up.
2424057	2424597	Interesting, huh?
2425297	2425558	Lucky you.
2425578	2425918	I know.
2426178	2426438	I know.
2427386	2428367	Well, it's excellent, though.
2428888	2432932	I can't wait to explain to my boss why certain things take longer than usual now.
2433733	2434593	That's what you have to do.
2434613	2435955	You just have to give justification.
2435975	2437236	That's what it's all about.
2437336	2439478	Once management starts fussing, things will change.
2440019	2444003	When it starts affecting how management looks, oh yeah, they'll make it change.
2444023	2446826	When they can't hit their girly porn, they'll fix it.
2448257	2451378	Alright, let's move on and get back into some news here.
2451478	2454179	Loki, Konami, what are they up to?
2454739	2457160	They're up to making some stuff.
2458301	2462522	No, they're jumping on the Nintendogs bandwagon, that's right.
2462722	2469885	Konami's making another dog simulator game, including a touch mode and stuff.
2470365	2472026	The only difference is, it's for PC.
2473428	2484778	All the pictures of this game all look like the dog is taking a crap.
2485398	2486719	It's true!
2486819	2487580	What is the game?
2488281	2488921	Pooping Dog?
2489782	2492024	It's Dog Station is what it is.
2492044	2495367	This looks like a great game for me to poop on.
2495407	2496868	Why can't they make a cat game?
2497188	2501251	Seriously, it's like dog picture dog pooping.
2501351	2504253	Dog picture dog pooping.
2504753	2506094	I guess that's the way he's sitting.
2506634	2506994	I don't know.
2507495	2508816	Dog poop is funny.
2509296	2517781	If I remember correctly, though, I believe Dog Station was an arcade game, I want to say, because I know that Dog Station is a franchise that they have out there right now.
2518722	2522564	I'm not exactly sure what you do, but DarkTetsuya in chat agrees with you.
2522765	2524446	It's interesting.
2525186	2526467	It'd be like Nintendogs at work.
2526707	2529008	Next you're going to be getting Bunga Bunga, the home version.
2529548	2530008	Gross.
2531428	2532689	If you don't know what that is, good.
2533529	2534029	You're lucky.
2534789	2535890	DarkSakura.
2536030	2536390	What?
2538390	2540871	You have an interesting story about a game I've been looking forward to.
2541211	2546473	I don't know much about it, but it still sounds fascinating to me, just the little I have heard about it.
2546513	2547313	Why do you need it?
2548593	2549133	I think I do.
2549734	2551074	I think we could all use a little bit of it.
2551614	2551994	What is it?
2552294	2553495	Brain training.
2554015	2554575	Oh-hoh.
2556196	2567840	Um, their, uh, brain training is, um, actually there was an announcement in the Mainichi Daily News, which I think is funny because Mainichi also means every day.
2567860	2580485	But anyway, um, it's, uh, basically, uh, to help your brain fire on all of the nerve structures and now doctors are recommending it to the elderly to help stimulate their brain.
2583064	2589849	There's a memory loss clinic at Kyoto's Uchida Hospital for patients suffering dementia.
2590870	2597415	They got a hold of the DSs and brain training and are using it to try to help
2598919	2600801	People get brain function back.
2601382	2611813	There's a quote from a 67-year-old patient named Isamu Shishido who said that he hoped the game would help him stop forgetting things like names and phone numbers so his daughter will stop making fun of him.
2612674	2614876	To quote, I don't want to end up some crazy old man.
2614936	2616958	I want to play a little every day before going to bed.
2617499	2618159	He said, is he a...
2619252	2620053	Reasonable Stuff.
2620133	2634962	Nintendo basically though is using this as an excuse to point out again that people of all ages like it's brain training software and that they're trying to use this strategy to try and appeal to existing games, you know,
2635982	2651875	Gamers who are out of it, non-gamers, trying to basically appeal to the whole broad market of gamers as this is something you can use to... I can't help but think myself, is this going to be the next game that really crosses that gap and gets everybody in on it, like Tetris?
2652135	2655978	Well, the theory is it's actually a publicity stunt because Nintendo is housed in Kyoto.
2657819	2658240	But, you know...
2658982	2679890	If it's going to pretty much help with, you know, because we're first marketing it to younger people and people of slow learning capacity, but if this is something that's going to also help keep the minds of older people sharp to hold off some of the effects of old age, then who are we to...
2683378	2685079	But who are we to tell them not to do it?
2685119	2691382	If it's actually helping people, if it does good, they should go for it.
2691462	2696285	Some folks in our chatroom might disagree with the brain training setting the stage to be a huge game.
2696826	2701649	Funnydale in our chatroom says, brain training, with that name alone, it's a sure bet that it'll fail in the USA.
2703530	2708873	I think brain Olympics would have been it, but then you fight with the Olympic committee over something like that, but
2711946	2719991	I remember a Fox special that was on, something like How Smart is America?
2720072	2721413	or the Great American Quiz.
2721433	2723374	Wasn't this a couple years ago they had this show on?
2723434	2725596	It was like a big 20-question quiz show.
2725616	2728318	Just attach the name American Idol to brain training.
2730279	2730539	Or Pop Idol.
2738423	2742987	and as opposites of that probably sounds, you know, American Idol does well in the ratings.
2744669	2745009	All right.
2746930	2748732	I vote for, like, Brain Food.
2749493	2749833	All right.
2750834	2759681	We're kind of winding down here with Orange Lounge Radio this week, but first off, a chance for anybody to get out any stories they haven't done yet before we get into tonight's last story.
2759961	2760342	I got one.
2760542	2760802	Okay.
2761683	2765306	This is going to become, well, actually, it should piss off a lot of people.
2766587	2781414	According to a post on Xbox.com, there is an internal Best Buy document, and we know how wonderful those are, stating that the new premium systems will now include a 100GB hard drive instead of the 20GB hard drive.
2781654	2782034	What?
2783195	2783555	Whoops.
2783575	2784855	Yeah, my thoughts exactly.
2785816	2786336	Exactly.
2786356	2787357	You bastards.
2787717	2792059	And this is supposed to coincide with the DirecTV downloadable...
2793863	2794143	All right.
2794243	2794583	All right.
2823178	2826760	Uh, last story of the night, Loki, what's the exciting news this week?
2827681	2835925	If you're a fan of really cheesy crap that's on TV, you might remember a show called Captain N. I remember how awful that show was.
2836425	2844330	That's right, the NES era cartoon featuring Kevin Keen, normal teenager battling the evil mother brain in Videoland.
2845622	2846683	Freakazoid was far better.
2875879	2876679	Oh, from the, yeah.
2876979	2878740	And I thought the character models were pretty good.
2878940	2879701	So what's the deal?
2880261	2881341	It jumped the shark with the Game Boy.
2881641	2882702	What's the deal with Captain N?
2882742	2883122	DVD?
2883462	2884102	Coming to DVD?
2884262	2885043	Oh, Jesus, when?
2885703	2888084	Don't have a when yet, but it is coming to DVD.
2889444	2892706	So to put next to your Zelda cartoons from the Super Mario Super Show.
2893566	2897648	This is also put out by the same people that did, I believe, what was it?
2897668	2899849	I don't remember the show now.
2900049	2900349	It was...
2902824	2904205	Cops, the animated series.
2904265	2905385	Hey, I liked Cops.
2905445	2912228	Which I might add got horrible reviews in the transfer, which sounds like real Ghostbusters versus Ghostbusters.
2914069	2924394	But the whole thing about Captain is that for anybody who ever paid attention to the actual storylines to the games, it was like a big old insult.
2926853	2928753	I just want to clarify some things in the chat room there.
2929214	2933735	The statement there, coming from a couple people, I'll read Sephiroth 1215's line here.
2934255	2936575	The HDDs aren't even 20 gigs, it was like 16.
2936935	2940736	This is because of the emulator that's pre-installed on the drive.
2940816	2944817	Oh yeah, they forgot to mention that when they're selling you the 20 gig hard drive.
2945057	2948398	By the way, there's already a big fat emulator on here that you can't really get rid of.
2951149	2954031	And also, it's pre-loaded with a bunch of songs, too.
2954131	2955611	Like, I had to go through and delete all the songs.
2955631	2960454	Because I actually loaded a custom soundtrack on my machine for when I'm playing, like, the little Bejeweleds and Zumas and stuff.
2960874	2964416	I put a custom soundtrack on there, so I had to delete all the crap that was already on there.
2965276	2965756	Frustrating.
2966037	2970399	And I do not like... I thought the way the Xbox handled the memory management was way better than 360.
2970439	2974141	Because in 360, you have to dive into all the submenus to erase something.
2974161	2975081	It's just very frustrating.
2975201	2977863	There's no global disk erase menu.
2978423	2978523	So...
2979198	2980739	Why would you want to erase anything ever?
2982580	2982900	I don't know.
2983661	2989484	Well, kids, it's about time to wrap up this edition of Orange Lounge Radio, but not before we go around and get everybody's final thought.
2989604	2990885	DarkSakura, your final thought.
2992506	2994007	Number one, reject false icons.
2994087	2998070	Number two, the redeeming quality of Captain N was the mother brain and the eggplant wizard.
2999070	3000451	That's true, the eggplant wizard did rock.
3001312	3002592	Bugged, thank you for being here tonight.
3002612	3003313	What's your final thought?
3005874	3006195	I don't know.
3007215	3008336	All right, Loki, your final thought.
3009134	3010256	I gotta play some more.
3010316	3011858	I actually gotta try Burnout online.
3012139	3016405	I hear that's good, but I need to get my full auto stuff done first.
3017366	3021472	And my final thought is I'm about to be sucked back into Final Fantasy XI.
3021552	3022493	Kill me dead!
3022974	3023675	Tick, tick, tick, tick.
3023976	3024336	Alright.
3025799	3028481	Thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening to us and supporting us.
3028521	3030663	Hey, don't forget, help promote us.

3044014	3045815	Yeah, we will take financial donations, too.
3046215	3046656	Candy gram.
3046976	3047216	All right.
3047577	3048037	And candy.
3048077	3048557	Mmm, candy.
3049038	3051059	Or brownies with espresso in them, right, DarkSakura?
3051740	3052480	Oh, hell yeah.
3052521	3053701	Wait, those had espresso in them?
3054162	3054922	Oh, hell yeah.
3056297	3057077	Till next week!
