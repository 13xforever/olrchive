00:00.000 --> 00:28.000
We are live here at the E3 Outpost for this special Thursday, E3 2006 edition.

00:28.000 --> 00:40.000
Welcome everybody to the Thursday edition of Orange Lounge Radio, live from the E3 Outpost, celebrating all things that is E3 2006.

00:40.000 --> 00:49.000
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky. Joining me as always, say hello to my exhausted yet perky co-host, Dark Soccer, also known as Jamie Summers.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Hi.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
How you doing?

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
I slept on the thingy.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
On the bus? I hate L.A. traffic.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
It took long enough that I could sleep.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
I took proper naps.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Well, whatever.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
Also, say hello to the one and only Tech Masoloki.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Hello.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
How you doing?

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
I'm good. I just ate a bunch of popcorn, chicken, and bacon out of these potatoes again.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Loving the catering at the E3 Outpost.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
And then I took the bacon and dipped it in barbecue sauce.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Good people.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
But that's what I can do to prove super bacon to the next level.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.000
Alright, next time. Also say hello, joining us again tonight, our good pal Bobby Blackwolf.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Yo.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
How you doing, Bobby?

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
I'm tired. My feet hurt.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
I am all weed out.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
That's probably how everybody feels about E3 today.

01:34.000 --> 01:41.000
Also, wave hello to Mr. Lawrence Young, who is producing us tonight. He doesn't have a mic, so he can't say hi back.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
But this is what he would say.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
That's me.

01:44.000 --> 01:51.000
Alright, first of all, for those of you guys listening live tonight, it's about, what, 7.50, and we are supposed to be on at 6.30.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
I apologize, especially to those of you guys on the East Coast.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Crap happens.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
We were actually at a booth right up until 5.45.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.000
We had an appointment at a booth, and so we actually missed the first shuttle back here to the Outpost, so we had to wait for the second one.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
So I apologize.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
It happens.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Technical difficulties.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
Anyway, let's talk about E3 and some of the stuff we saw today.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
We're going to play three interesting things.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
Dark Sakura, what's one of them?

02:18.000 --> 02:24.000
There's a, I went to the games of Korea, or whatever they called it.

02:24.000 --> 02:31.000
And apparently one of the companies is bringing out a new Kunio game in, this is 2007.

02:31.000 --> 02:37.000
But they're basically giving rebirth to the Kunio franchise, which I thought was pretty cool.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
And he seemed absolutely surprised that I would, is that a Kunio game?

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
For those who don't know what that is, was that a popular anime?

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
It was brought over as River City Ransom.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Oh, shit!

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
And Dodgeball.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
That's all I needed to hear.

02:49.000 --> 02:56.000
But, um, overseas it was Hot-Blooded Downtown Story and Kunio Dodgeball.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
What's this new game they're doing?

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
I didn't really tell much about it because I don't read Korean.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
But it's a Kunio game.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
What did it look like they were doing? Were they playing a sport? Were they beating each other up?

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
They didn't show any pictures of it, it was just like the artwork for it.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
I was like, Kunio game! I mean, I don't care, it's Kunio.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
The same guy who I surprised was also surprised that I played Ragnarok Online.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
He was apparently one of the people who worked on it.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Oh, very cool.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
I was like, hey, you're my hero. You have created my addiction.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
If you want to talk to Dark Soccer about Kunio, you can join our chat room.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
It's chat.allgames.com for tonight.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
But everything is actually filtered through Bobby tonight.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.000
Because I left the Eyebyuk at home. I call it the Eyebyuk after Bjork because I love her.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
So I have my Eyebyuk back at the hotel.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
So Dark Sakura and Loki and myself have no way of seeing chat, only Bobby.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
So be nice to me.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
I can see from here and I can, like, laugh at people.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
We will take calls a little later on in the program, but if you're calling in right now, too bad. We're playing a game.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
Just to say something to Fantas.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
I've been looking for Gravity every year, so I can ask him where's Ragnarok Online 2.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
Wasn't Ragnarok Online 2 supposed to be, like, last year's E3?

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
I have no idea. Gravity never shows up.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
They're too busy banning people.

04:15.000 --> 04:23.000
There is actually a Wikipedia article up for Ragnarok Online 2 that has some of the features from previous information that's been leaked.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
So maybe you can find something there. I don't know.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
I have a site for it, but it's a placeholder.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
Again, for those of you guys who are listening to us and going, God, those guys don't sound normal.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
Well, that's because we're at the E3 Outpost and you get that nice ambient.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
The little club going on in the background.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Who's DJing down there?

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
I don't know.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Who's pretty funky?

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Lawrence is shaking his head.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
I can probably check my flyer.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Let's get his card after the show.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Alright.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
Loki, what was something you saw today? We heard about Korean Kunio.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
What's something interesting you saw today, Loki?

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
Well, something a bit more normal, I guess.

04:59.000 --> 05:05.000
We actually went and saw the Gears of War demonstration, and that was pretty sexy, actually.

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
I totally dig the way Microsoft has their theater set up.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
That's the way you do it right there.

05:12.000 --> 05:22.000
Yeah, the way Microsoft had their theater for Gears of War is that you actually went in and you would put these headphones on so that all the outside noise is blocked.

05:22.000 --> 05:28.000
But you can hear the Gears of War stuff clearly, and that way you're not blasting the whole booth full of noise.

05:28.000 --> 05:34.000
And then there's also surround sound in the floor, so when the guns went off, it vibrated your butt.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
That's exactly how theirs was last year.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
So if you want a free butt massage at E3, go check out the Gears of War demo.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
No, what did you think of the game itself, though, Gears of War?

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
I thought it looked awesome.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
I'm not really into a lot of first-person shooters, but it looked pretty solid.

05:47.000 --> 05:53.000
I haven't seen the Halo trailer yet, but I would say it probably looks better than Halo.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
I don't do a lot of first-person shooters either. I do do Halo. I think Halo's awesome.

05:57.000 --> 06:04.000
But Gears of War, what I liked about it is that it looked like it was really dummy-fied, like a lot of one-button stuff.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
Because basically the developer or whoever was showing it to us went through the game twice.

06:09.000 --> 06:15.000
The first time they went through the first level and just jammed through it.

06:15.000 --> 06:20.000
They just jammed through the level, and I was like, wow, that guy's doing a lot of shit. I'll never be able to recreate it.

06:20.000 --> 06:26.000
But then the second time, he went back through the game and showed how easy it was to be hacking people with chainsaws and all the cool stuff he was doing.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
It's a very violent game.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
Very violent. Very, very pretty, though.

06:31.000 --> 06:37.000
Yeah, and the only minor, minor bench I have is that there were some frame rate problems.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
But I'm hoping...

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
I think that's just the video.

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
Yeah, it's just a develop or whatever it is issue, and that'll be gone by the time it actually rolls out.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
For those of you guys that are into Halo, the fact that this thing has multiplayer, this is going to be your holdover for Halo 3.

06:49.000 --> 06:55.000
And it might even be a real good, right up their competitor with Halo 3, like Half-Life, Quake, one of those.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
It might actually be coming around around the same time as Halo 3.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
No, they said 2006, so we're holding them to that.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
Well, Halo's supposed to be in 2006 also.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
I don't believe it. I say Halo 3 not until next year.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Well, they said otherwise.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
I don't give a crap what they say. It's not true.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
They would have shown playable footage at E3 if it was true.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Good point.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Bobby!

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Hi.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Three interesting things. What's one of them?

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
Well, I kind of spent all day in one place, so it's kind of hard.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
Well, you've got to have seen at least three demos while you were there. Where did you spend your whole day?

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
I spent my whole day playing with my Wii and Nintendo.

07:31.000 --> 07:41.000
You guys suck with your booth design, making me wait in line for two hours so I could sit in other lines watching people play 20-minute demos.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
So if there's four people in front of you, that's an hour just to play one game.

07:44.000 --> 07:49.000
I hate Nintendo's booth this year. I absolutely hate it. I'm not talking about the games in it.

07:49.000 --> 07:54.000
The booth? I hate it. It is horrible compared to the past two years.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
It's atrocious. I could just...

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
We're going to do FUs of the Week later.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Okay, cool. Did we bring One Wiggin' Angel?

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
No, I didn't bring it. You're going to sing it.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
No, no, later. All right.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
But I did get to play a lot with the Wii, and I'll pretty much start.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
The first thing that I'll talk about here is probably the tech demos and some of the stuff that they're doing.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
I'm going to help you here. What was the first thing you went for?

08:21.000 --> 08:27.000
Because you get in there, there's what, 20 games in there. You must have went right to something.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Wii Orchestra.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Why did you pick Wii Orchestra?

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
Because it was the first one in the little thing to go in.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
Were you just like, you're going to go in there like, I'm going to go around each and every one of these things?

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
It wasn't quite set up like that. You had to get past this row of little mini living rooms.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
And then you got to the demos.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Well, see, Wii Orchestra was in the living rooms.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
It was like the least packed living room.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Okay.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
And I'm a music person.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
So I did it, and for those, since you guys don't, you know,

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
here in Orange County, you guys don't really know some of my background,

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
I actually play symphonic percussion.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
I am in two wind symphonies in the Atlanta area.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
I know how to conduct, because I have conducted before.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
But you got to realize, and what I was trying to see is, you know,

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
I know Dance Dance Revolution is not a dancing simulator.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
You can't learn how to play guitar with Guitar Hero.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
You can't conduct with Wii Orchestra.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
It was very hard. I was trying to, you know, use real conducting techniques,

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
and it's not that good yet.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
You do have to treat it like a video game.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
It's sometimes too sensitive, sometimes not sensitive enough.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
But it was interesting.

09:30.000 --> 09:35.000
What did you learn about the Wii controller today?

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
That I learned the tech specs of it.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
And what are the tech specs of the Wiimote?

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Okay.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
I don't care what, I'm calling this the Wiimote.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Wiicon.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
Dark Sakura says Wiicon, I say Wiimote.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
So we're just always going to have this back and forth

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
until Miyamoto can clear this up.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
So, and by the way, Funny Dale, final for long,

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
was right at the very end of the booth, right before you.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
Anyway, here's the thing.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Nintendo kept saying, oh, you know, making you think

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
that it was kind of like a 3D mouse.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
It would be able to tell where it was in 3D space.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
You know, you'd be able to put the controller on the floor,

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
and know it was on the floor.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
No, it's not like that.

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
It's accelerometers and an IR infrared blaster,

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
just like your TV's remote control.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
So a lot of things, like, people were saying,

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
oh, it's so sensitive, you know,

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
when they were playing, like, the Duck Hunt thing.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
It's an IR, and the receiver is that little sensor

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
that has double-stick tape that you put under your TV.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
So the farther away you are from your TV,

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
the less sensitive it is.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
That's how you fix the sensitivity.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Since we were two feet away from the screen,

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
it was very, very, very sensitive.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Well, also, the thing is, they're going to be adjusting

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
the sensitivity, and you're going to have an adjustment

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
very similar to, like, a calibrating a mouse sensitivity.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Right, but I mean, what I'm saying is, like,

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
we could, like, step back another foot,

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
and that would adjust the sensitivity as well.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
And they're not telling people that.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
They're trying to say it's some, like, revolutionary technology.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Tell me more about the sensor.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
You said it's just a little piece of tape, practically?

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Yeah, it's a little piece, well, no, it's not really tape.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
It's got double-stick tape.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
That's how it attaches to your TV.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
But you can put it on a table as long, you know,

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
because some people were asking, you know,

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
okay, I have a projector, and I project on my wall.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
And they're like, well, you know, you should mount it to the wall

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
underneath where your screen is or something and stuff.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
But it's not used in every game.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
Only in the games that actually use the IR sensor,

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
which Excite Truck is not one of.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
That only used the accelerometers in it.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Very interesting.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
So, you know, some games don't even need that sensor.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
You can take that sensor away and still play Excite Truck.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
All right.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
That's very interesting.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
I think Bobby's going to win round one of three interesting things,

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
because that was very interesting.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
All right.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Well, here's mine.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
My interesting thing I saw was Luminous 2.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
I went and saw Luminous 2, which was being shown at one of Mr. Games.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
You know why Luminous 2 is interesting?

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
I didn't see any damn difference from Luminous 1.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
Not a damn thing was different from Luminous 1.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Okay, some of the themes were different,

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
and it seemed to have more video in the background,

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
and they changed the look.

12:08.000 --> 12:14.000
I was surprised, because Luminous Live on Xbox looks a lot like Luminous 2.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
As for new modes, whatever else, it wasn't in the demo,

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
so I couldn't tell you, and nobody at the booth told me anything extra.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
So as far as I know, if you have Luminous,

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
there's really no need to get Luminous 2.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
I imagine they'll announce other things later,

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
but they're not in the demo.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
I started the demo from scratch.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
It takes you right in the game.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
In fact, some of the music was the same.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
Yeah, some of the music and themes were the exact same.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Not a good demo in my opinion.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
I was very disappointed in Luminous 2.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
However, the surprise of Luminous on Xbox Live,

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
which I actually played today,

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
complete with the Madonna video and everything,

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
was a great experience, because it's nice to play it on a huge TV and all that stuff.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
So that's one of mine.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
Dark Sakura, you got a second interesting thing for us?

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Star Trek Legacy.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
Ah, yes. Now this is the show that made us late.

13:01.000 --> 13:07.000
Yeah, we had a meeting with Bethesda to see their demo for that.

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
That was pretty sick.

13:11.000 --> 13:16.000
You basically can pick from any generation of the Star Trek universe,

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
with the exception of, I think, Enterprise.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
No, Enterprise is in there all five generations.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
No, Enterprise was not there.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
As in the series Enterprise.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Yeah, the series Enterprise, not the ship.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
No, according to the trailer that they had, it included Enterprise.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
They didn't show it in the demo.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
According to them, they had original series,

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
they had Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
That was it.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Well, not according to their trailer.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
Okay, I feel like I'm in the movie Trekkies right now. What else?

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Well, according to their rep, that's what I said.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Alright.

13:48.000 --> 13:55.000
Anyway, you can also play as Romulans, you can play as Klingons,

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
you can play as the Borg, which I thought was pretty cool.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
And you can assimilate people.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
That's cool.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Only in the multiplayer.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Only multiplayer.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
The single player is all...

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
It's all Federation.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Yeah, Federation.

14:07.000 --> 14:13.000
It was, they actually, on the demo, they recreated the battle from The Wrath of Khan.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
That was pretty awesome.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
This game is a Trekkies wet dream.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Oh, yeah.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
They went all out.

14:18.000 --> 14:23.000
They have everything nailed down, like the ship specs, the, you know,

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
like you say, the recreation of certain scenarios.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
And, you know, if you're into Star Trek, you're gonna think it's great.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
And...

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
You have full range of motion in that game.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
On top of that, if you are a little bit iffy on direction,

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
you can even go to a strategic map mode, select where you want to go,

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
and it'll just go there.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
You can even play the whole game in strategic map mode,

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
but it's a little eh.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
It's like more for, okay, I want to go here, and then I'm gonna fight.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
It's definitely a tactical ship game, too.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
I actually thought when we were going in there,

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
I thought we were gonna see the Star Trek MMO,

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
which is nowhere to be seen.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
I guess it's still in early development.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
But I was, I'm a casual Trekkie.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Like, I like Star Trek.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
It's cool.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
I don't like it now that it's on G4, but I'll watch it other places.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
But it's a good show.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
You know, it's fun.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
And a lot of, you know, high school memories and stuff.

15:12.000 --> 15:19.000
But it's definitely complete, like, very complete for the Star Trek hardcore fan.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
I mean, they went to all these resources.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
And even for the casual Trek fan,

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
it's gonna have tutorial modes that ease you into it

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
and easy scenarios type situations.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
And it's very pretty to look at.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
I mean, it's a pretty, pretty game.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
So I was very impressed with Star Trek Legacy.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Thumbs up.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Yes.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
All right.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Loki, one interesting thing.

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
I got to play more of the PlayStation 2 today.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
The interesting part...

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Why don't you come over to my house and play PlayStation 2?

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
You mean PlayStation 3?

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
PlayStation 3.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
I played both today.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
All right.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
I got it only.

15:54.000 --> 15:59.000
No, PlayStation 3 actually played two different games.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
And here's the thing.

16:01.000 --> 16:06.000
The surprising thing is I'm not impressed by the PlayStation 3 at all.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
And I played one of the games I've been looking forward to

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
ever since I saw the video MotorStorm.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
What the hell?

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
I mean, it's completely...

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
It's just an average game.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
So what?

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Oh, goody.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
You got the mud effects right.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
Doesn't make it any better of an off-road game.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Okay.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
What did you like about the movie that you saw?

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
What I liked about the movie,

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
the movie made it seem like it's gonna be burnout off-road type of thing.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
Really fast, really crazy-ass gameplay

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
where cars are just crashing and flipping all over the place and exploding.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Fire, just lots of stuff like that.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
And what was the reality of the demo?

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
The reality of the demo was it was just an off-road game.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
Cars seemed to be driving extremely slow.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
In fact, a lot of times you'd fall off a cliff or whatever.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
If you did happen to crash, it would do a slow-mo instant replay of it,

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
and it was very unimpressive.

16:58.000 --> 17:03.000
Especially for a next-gen game, I see better crashes and burnout.

17:03.000 --> 17:08.000
And I'm talking about, you know, even I think before burnout,

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
it's really sad.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
Burnout PlayStation 2 has better crashes than this game.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
What else did you check out on PlayStation 3?

17:17.000 --> 17:23.000
I checked out Gran Turismo HD and also not impressed by it at all.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
With the paper people?

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Yeah, the paper people.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
They're back.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
In high def.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
It's not necessarily the paper people.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
They're actually kind of 3D, but they don't move.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
They're just kind of stationary.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
In the Grand Canyon level, they do move.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Yeah, a little bit.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
But here's the thing.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
If you drive past them, they're still looking behind you down the track

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
like something's going to happen.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Well, let's give them a break, though.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
It's an early, early build.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
That all might still change, you know?

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
It's pretty.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
I'll give it that.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
They're not the only game that uses paper people.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
I mean, let's look at MotoGP 2006.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
I played that today also.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Same problem.

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
The whole thing is it's not impressive enough to get me to spend more money.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
This thing has got to be leaps and bounds better than the 360

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
in order for me to spend that kind of money.

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
I'm really not seeing anything really unique and revolutionary

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
coming out for anything on the PlayStation 3.

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
It's all just more of the same crap, just prettier.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
I did notice, though, that Sonic the Hedgehog

18:19.000 --> 18:24.000
and there's a few other games, I think, that were on both platforms

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
looked a little better on the PlayStation 3.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
The Sonic looked a little bit better.

18:29.000 --> 18:36.000
Was it Mobile Suit Gundam looked extremely better than the 360 version?

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
I don't know if it's the monitors that they're playing on,

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
but it looked like night and day for that.

18:41.000 --> 18:46.000
Pretty graphics can't make me forgive the botch job done on Sonic.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
All right, Bobby, how's Chat Room doing?

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
They're doing fine.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
They're pitching about G4 right now, actually.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
They're asking if we went by G4's booth and what was going on.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
I have avoided it at all costs.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
I heard a bunch of monkeys outside the booth today going,

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Ah! Oh, my God!

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
And just didn't care.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
What were they cheering for?

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Attack of the Show, I think, was live from E3.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Hi, Mom, I'm on TV.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Oh, Kevin Pereira, what the fuck you did?

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Ah, love you, ah!

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Yeah, pretty much.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Yeah, no, not for me.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
I kept running into them today.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
They had booth babes doing weird things.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Now, you brought this up when we were walking around

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
that there was not a swarm of G4 people like there was in years past.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
That's because they're not a gaming channel again.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
Well, right, I know. They're off getting guys.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Yeah.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Did they get you?

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
No, that's their slogan. We get guys.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
They're off getting guys.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
That's why I'm asking you. Did they get you?

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
Uh-huh.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
Did they get you?

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
No.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Okay, good.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
No, they don't have me.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
I hid from them.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
Here's the thing, though.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
You're not a guy.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
I see swarms of GameTap shirts, which is okay because I like GameTap.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Right.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
But I was surprised at that.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
I don't think they're working for GameTap.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Was GameTap giving away something to shirt holders?

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
They were giving away shirts.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
I missed that one out.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
Well, yeah, but you don't wear your shirts that you win the next day.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
The shirts I get...

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Some people...

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Some people...

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Oh, okay.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Look at that right here.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Sorry.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
He's a freak.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Okay.

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
The shirts I get at E3, I wear to the gym, which isn't very often,

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
but that's where they get used.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
That's my wardrobe is all my E3 shirts, and I haven't gotten a single one this year.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
I know.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
So I'm going to be naked next week, and I'm a fat man, so that's not a good thing.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Cheap.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Cheap.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
No, very disappointing swag this year.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
You know why?

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Everybody's shit is online.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Well, I don't know.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
I pretty much hoard myself out to Namco for tokens.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
Okay, but you may have gotten some shit, and I've gotten some closer.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
I have slime keychains.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
But is it as good as it was two years ago with the swag?

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
I say no.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
No.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
No.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
No.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
But I got slime keychains.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
The swag goes down every year.

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
This is my tenth E3, and I have actually noticed every single year I get less and less and

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
less swag.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
It goes down every year.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
Because they're getting cheap.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
Yep.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Everything's awesome.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
I got a clock from the Korean people.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
Pretty soon E3 is going to be online.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
That's fine, though, because I hate traffic here.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
I wish they'd moved E3 to Vegas or somewhere that's built to hold a convention.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
I think they should bring it back to Atlanta.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
I loved it when it was in Atlanta.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Yeah, but you have selfish reasons for that.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
I actually wouldn't mind going to Atlanta.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
I wouldn't mind either.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
I'm sure it's a great place.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
Because then I can go to E3 and drive back to Mobile and hang out with my family and

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
then play home.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
I don't think you're right.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
Dear ESA, please have E3 in Mr. Blackwell's backyard.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Yes.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
All right.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
Speaking of Bobby, one interesting thing.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Another one.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
Number two.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
Yeah, another one.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
One thing, since more Wii, since apparently I played the Wii all day today.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
You played with your Wii all day long.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
I played with my Wii.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
And here's the thing.

21:50.000 --> 21:57.000
A lot of people are actually wondering about, and this is more about the IR games.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
They're like, oh, my arm's going to get tired when I play these games all that much.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Your arm gets tired after you play with your Wii too long.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
Exactly.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Okay.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Well, there is a way to play with your Wii without moving your arm.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
You really only need very...

22:08.000 --> 22:13.000
I was holding the controller in the same position that I would hold a PS2 controller.

22:13.000 --> 22:21.000
Because I've been doing very slight movements with my wrist, so you don't have to worry about every single game making you do sweeping motions.

22:21.000 --> 22:28.000
Now, yes, WarioWare does make you do hula hoops and squats and stuff like that.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
But not all the games are going to really tire you out.

22:31.000 --> 22:39.000
And so I thought that was kind of interesting, you know, how natural I could actually be laying on the couch and playing some of these games.

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
I think there actually need to be more games that wear people out.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Well, WarioWare's a good start.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
And then maybe that horse racing game...

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Final Furlong?

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Dark Sakura wants Wii Torture Chamber.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
No, I don't want Wii Torture Chamber.

22:52.000 --> 22:57.000
I want, like, Wii Robics and, like, Wii Boot Camp.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Wii Boot Camp sounds better.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
Wii Boot Camp.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Because I think about Dance Aerobics and, like...

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
They can fully bring back Dance Aerobics on the Wii.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
No.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
Wii!

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Hook up a DDR mat and then have the controller.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
There you go.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
Well, that's pretty much the same thing with the eye toy and...

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
It's something...

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Yeah, but this is by Nintendo, so it'll be better.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
So it'll be awesome.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
You know it and I know it.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
If they brought out a new Dance Aerobics, you'd play it once and that would be it.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
No.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
That's me.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
I wouldn't.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
Anyway.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
My second interesting thing I saw today would be the...

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
Eye of Judgment.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Did you make your judgment on it?

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
I did make a judgment on it.

23:35.000 --> 23:39.000
What a waste of fucking space at the PlayStation 3 booth.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
What a waste of fucking space.

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
And I'm sorry to the guys that developed this because I'm sure they worked very hard on

23:46.000 --> 23:50.000
this, but now is not the time to be showing me the Eye of Judgment.

23:50.000 --> 23:54.000
The Eye of Judgment could have been done on the PS2.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
I...

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
From my perspective...

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
Now, granted, I don't know any tech stuff about PS3.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
The Eye of Judgment...

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
For those that don't know what the Eye of Judgment is, it's that thing they showed at

24:04.000 --> 24:09.000
the conference where you put the card down and whoosh, a monster comes onto the screen.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
It looked like Yu-Gi-Oh.

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
I guess it's supposed to be a game, but the people admitted that it wasn't really a game

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
but more like a tech demo.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
I don't know.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
Loki, you saw the Eye of Judgment.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
What was your thoughts?

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Well, here's the thing.

24:20.000 --> 24:25.000
When basically you have to put down a card and the eye toy, or it wasn't really an eye

24:25.000 --> 24:30.000
toy, it was just a camera, would recognize these barcode light things on top and bottom

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
of the card, and there's also like four triangles on it to kind of orient the card so it knows

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
which direction it's facing because that's important.

24:37.000 --> 24:41.000
So, basically, it will spawn whatever monster based on what card it is.

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
Now, here's the thing that really kind of bugged me about it.

24:44.000 --> 24:49.000
You can cast spells on your monsters as well, but the spell card is put on top of the monster

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
card, and you have to remember to take the card off after the spell is cast, otherwise

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
it casts again because it's stupid.

24:56.000 --> 25:01.000
And also, if you're playing the game and happen to destroy a monster, you have to remember

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
to take it off the board, otherwise it spawns the monster again because it's stupid.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
Yeah, the Eye of Judgment has an IQ of about three.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
Here's the other thing that the geniuses...

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
They need a brain of judgment.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
Here's the geniuses that Sony didn't think about.

25:15.000 --> 25:19.000
Okay, this game uses actual cards like magic cards or something like that.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
Well, if you're actually going to be playing this game, they're playing on selling expansion

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
packs later on.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Here's the only problem here.

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
You can probably scan those cards and print them back out again, and there you go.

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
You have two cards because the camera's not going to know the difference between a fake

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
and a real card.

25:35.000 --> 25:39.000
Okay, Bobby, who are those Cats and Ken show we saw the first day that are here tonight?

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
Novint Falcon.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
Okay, Novint.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
N-O-V-I-N-T.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
Describe Novint for the listeners real quick, and there's a reason I'm doing this.

25:46.000 --> 25:52.000
Okay, Novint Falcon, basically what it is, it's a PC peripheral, and it takes USB, and

25:52.000 --> 25:58.000
essentially it has touch sensitive, so it's a little ball, and I will link it in chat

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
because I've got to go find it on Google, and I'll put the link in chat.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
I think it's novint.com slash falcon.htm or something like that.

26:04.000 --> 26:11.000
And you put your fingers on this little ball, and say there is a ball on the screen.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
You actually push forward, and it will stop at the ball, and you can actually trace around

26:14.000 --> 26:20.000
the ball, and then if they have ridges on it, you can actually feel the ridges as you

26:20.000 --> 26:25.000
touch the ball, or like, if you have like balls, you can have a rubber band, and it

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
will actually pull you around.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
You can feel your balls, like they're right there in your hand.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
So we have gone from the Wii to the balls.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Alright, no, but seriously though, okay.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
Explicit tag, here we come.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
These are all, yeah, I think we have to explicit this show.

26:37.000 --> 26:44.000
Um, look, um, the point is that these are all tech demos, but this, they also have,

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
what was it, Half-Life they were showing?

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
They had Half-Life 2 and something else, and they are here tonight.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Yeah, now here's the thing.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
That, I went and played that, and I thought, this is great.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Why isn't this on a console?

26:55.000 --> 26:59.000
That is what Sony should be having in their little rooms right now.

26:59.000 --> 27:04.000
The Eye of Judgment is, it is not time for the Eye of Judgment, okay.

27:04.000 --> 27:09.000
That, I would have been far more impressed if Sony had teamed up with those Novant guys

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
and were showing that thing.

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
It's not a smart name to be calling that either, the Eye of Judgment.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
I judge this crap.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
All right.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
It is Novant.com slash Falcon dot HTML.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
All right, we gotta keep things moving.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
If you guys are listening live, gamer Andy will be out momentarily.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
I'm looking right at him, he's sitting there.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Hi, gamer Andy, how you doing?

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
Uh, and we're starting to butt into his time a little bit.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
Yeah, that's fine, that's fine.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
Okay, good.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Yeah, I see him chowing down on a sandwich, so I'll wait till he's finished.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
Then we'll get out of here.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
They spent an hour and a half in L.A. traffic.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
Oh, well, poor bastards.

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
All right, so, yeah, those of you guys listening live, you'll hear him next,

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
but if you miss it for whatever reason,

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
they've got their podcast over at gamerandy.com.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
Check it out, it's rad.

27:52.000 --> 27:58.000
All right, one other thing you thought was interesting today, Dark Sakura.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins on PSP.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
It was purdy.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
Now, this is not the same as the Capcom Classics thing

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
that also has Ghosts and Goblins, right?

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
This is an all-new Ghosts and Goblins game.

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
What's so funky new about it?

28:13.000 --> 28:17.000
You don't get golden armor, you get, like, blue pimp armor or something.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
And, like, one of the enemies in the new one is these hands

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
that reach out of the ground and grab you

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
and then, like, throw you into a vat of acid

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
or, like, bang you into the ground.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
And, like, the spitting plants were still there.

28:29.000 --> 28:33.000
The little ghosty things were still there.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
I didn't see the vampire in a box from the old ones.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
You could still shoot the vases.

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
They're still there. Or urns, I guess, are more accurate.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
I did go on one of the bosses.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
There's actually new weapons.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
And you have a refillable life bar.

28:51.000 --> 28:55.000
But when that's out, then you turn into the, you know, naked guy.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
Oh, that's cool.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
That seems to help the difficulty a little bit, I think.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
I actually avoided them at first because I thought they were the holy water

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
and the holy water sucks.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
One of your weapons is a crossbow.

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
You also have little bombs.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
You can get, you know, you start off with the lances, of course,

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
which I still think are the better weapons.

29:15.000 --> 29:20.000
You also get, like, a vine whip, which really sucks ass.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Another cool thing about that that just made me laugh,

29:22.000 --> 29:27.000
I actually took a little bit of video of this, sort of stealthily,

29:27.000 --> 29:35.000
is one of the cursed forms that he can get is as a woman.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Which I would think that would be a blessing.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
What a curse indeed.

29:39.000 --> 29:43.000
Hey, hey, it actually made the boss fight better because she is, like,

29:43.000 --> 29:50.000
in this big, she looks very peasant German, you know,

29:50.000 --> 29:56.000
like you see in the old history books, in a big dress.

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
And she'd sort of float in the air, sort of like Princess Peach,

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
which was cool because you could still attack.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
She would just move slower, like a really huge woman.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
But you throw attacks while you're floating in the air

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
and you can still hit the boss.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
It actually ended up being more convenient,

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
but of course when you get hit, you lose the form again.

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
But I enjoyed it immensely. The music was still good.

30:17.000 --> 30:23.000
It was also right next to Tekken, so I was going between the two for a while.

30:23.000 --> 30:27.000
But, you know, I actually wasn't too sure about it at first

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
until I talked to Dan on the phone yesterday.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
He's like, you were going to go play Ultimate Ghost of Goblins.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
I was like, okay. So I did and I had a good time.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
It was pretty fun.

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
I was when I was hanging out with Julie, custom E19,

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
who she was over there playing Ace Combat.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
She's like, I don't like this game.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
I was like, go play Ghost of Goblins.

30:47.000 --> 30:52.000
She's like, no. But no, it was great. It was fantastic.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Loki.

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
Actually the surprising game that I saw today was this game

30:58.000 --> 31:02.000
that probably from a company no one's ever heard of.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
It's actually by this group called On Games,

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
and the game was called Wild Summer.

31:08.000 --> 31:12.000
Now, basically this game is like a sandbox game,

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
very similar to Granth and Auto,

31:14.000 --> 31:18.000
but it's basically like kind of a plot line to American Pie.

31:18.000 --> 31:25.000
You're this trouble-starting teenager with hormones raging.

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
Loki, tell them why we went to look at this game.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Because I saw the game and I'm like, ooh, I got to go play that

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
because it looked like Leisure Suit Larry.

31:32.000 --> 31:36.000
Well, I know I saw the poster and it showed this teenage boy

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
that was stealing panties off a clothes line,

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
and I was like, I have to see whatever that fucking game is.

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
That looks too unreal to be true.

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
So anyways, it looks amazing so far.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
They still have about a year and a half of development left

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
that's supposed to be coming out in fall of 2007.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
But the thing is, it's going to be,

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
they've got like a ton of different stuff in here.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
One of the things that they were showing was the kind of,

32:00.000 --> 32:06.000
oh, what was it, like the free-running type of stuff in there.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
So you're jumping from buildings and stuff.

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
You kind of have the same Prince of Persia gameplay.

32:11.000 --> 32:15.000
It also has a bunch of mini-games, including like dancing,

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
playing beach volleyball.

32:17.000 --> 32:21.000
But they have a dating part in it too, kind of like a dating sim.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
And the way the dating sim is, it's going to be playing Magic the Gathering.

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
You're actually going to have like cards for, you know,

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
pretend you're interested in their conversation, you know,

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
get her drunk, stuff like that.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
It's a very ambitious game.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
It sounds like there's a lot they want to do with it.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
But I was really impressed with the guy,

32:38.000 --> 32:42.000
and they were very nice to us too.

32:42.000 --> 32:45.000
It looked like they've gone into a lot of detail.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
They've really thought out about what they want to do,

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
like what their dream game is, and they're going and doing it.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
And I asked this question, and Jamie, you might appreciate this.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
I don't know.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
I said, why would a woman ever want to play this game?

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
Essentially, I said, what is in this for a woman?

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
And basically what they said is that we have women on staff

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
helping us write this game.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
We're not out to make a tacky game.

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
Leisure Suit Larry is now a tacky franchise now.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
We're out to make a fun game, you know.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
That's why there's no nudity in this game.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
Sorry, guys.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
There's no nudity.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
There's no, like it's not perverted.

33:20.000 --> 33:24.000
It's just silly fun, like the American Pie or Porky's movies,

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
those types of things.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
It's just a little bit of dumb fun.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
So they think that women might want to play it just because it's silly.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
It's not meant to be a serious game.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
That was interesting.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
I'm not interested.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Really?

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
Take a look.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
I walked by it.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
No, I was over there.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
I'm not interested.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
What turned you on?

33:42.000 --> 33:47.000
I don't see what fun it is to play a hormonal 16-year-old.

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
Well, you haven't been a hormonal 16-year-old boy.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
Exactly.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
I have no interest in it.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
There's nothing that links it to me.

33:54.000 --> 33:59.000
I was spending my 16-year-old kicking off the horny 16-year-old boys.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
That's all right.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
They still have Desperate Housewives out there.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
You know what?

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
Shut up.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Desperate Housewives will teach you how to cook and gossip.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
I was surprised.

34:07.000 --> 34:12.000
They actually go into extreme detail on cooking in that game.

34:12.000 --> 34:16.000
Yeah, it's like you can pick from recipes and all this crap.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
I don't need a video game to teach me how to cook.

34:18.000 --> 34:23.000
I am so glad I'm on the edge of this stage so I can just run down the stairs as quick

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
as possible.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
We've done this for years.

34:25.000 --> 34:30.000
And one of these days, I'm going to combust, and you'll be right next to me.

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
I was actually surprised at how thorough the Desperate Housewives game looked to be.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
I was actually kind of surprised.

34:36.000 --> 34:41.000
It's a really intricate game, but it's stupid.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
It's a great game, but it's stupid.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
It's intricate, but it's stupid.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
Intricately stupid.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
Yeah.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
What a waste.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
What a waste.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
But Wild Summer, you know what?

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
I think it'll be cute.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
I want to see it.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
They're working on getting it on the 360.

34:55.000 --> 35:00.000
And to be honest, there's nothing like it out there, especially on the 360.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
And they had other games, too, that looked pretty good.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
All right.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
We've got to keep it moving, guys.

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
Bobby, one more interesting thing from today.

35:08.000 --> 35:12.000
Going for the Wii trifecta because I just can't stop talking about my Wii.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
Oh, wouldn't that be a Triforce?

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
Bobby, a Triforce.

35:14.000 --> 35:18.000
Oh, wow.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
We'll be here till Friday.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
Thank you.

35:20.000 --> 35:25.000
The virtual console, they actually had two demo units running of the virtual console

35:25.000 --> 35:29.000
with that new controller that they were showing that looks like a Super Nintendo controller

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
with dual analog sticks.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
Cool.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
And it's a very light controller, very comfortable to me.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
They had five games running.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
They had one for each system, pretty much.

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
They had Super Mario Brothers on the NES, Super Mario World on the SNES,

35:42.000 --> 35:45.000
Super Mario 64 on the N64, Sonic the Hedgehog on Genesis,

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
and Bonk's Adventure on the TurboGrafx.

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
Did they show anything about how the games would be bought or anything,

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
or was it just title screen go?

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
Just title screen go.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
That's kind of lame.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
And Super Mario 64 has some frame rate issues.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
Ouch.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
And it's hard to control with that controller.

36:00.000 --> 36:05.000
Well, the whole thing, too, is the virtual console wasn't a finished product either.

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
This is a concept right now.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
They haven't even worked out the details.

36:10.000 --> 36:14.000
Yes, the SNES and the Genesis games worked really well.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
I mean, it felt good.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
Then I'll back off.

36:17.000 --> 36:21.000
The thing is, though, I haven't played a TurboGrafx in so long.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
I believe that Bonk's worked really well.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
I mean, it looked fine to me.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
I didn't notice any glitches or anything,

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
but I can't compare it to the original TurboGrafx.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Did it tell you to press run?

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
I didn't look.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
I did love how sharp the games looked.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
Yeah.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
It was so high res.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
I mean, it's pillar boxed, but it's still high.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
Yeah.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
It's still pixelated.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
Maybe they up-coded it somehow or something.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Yeah, they had to up-convert it probably to 480p.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
Well, that's cool.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
Hey, hats off there.

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
Actually, I saw Super Mario World yesterday.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
I thought it looked really clean.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
Awesome.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
All right.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Chat room question from a while ago.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
Oh, yes, please.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
I'm sorry.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
Sorry, chat room again.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
I don't have the iBUCS, so we can't look at chat.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
Jamie and I.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
But Bobby, what's chat room say?

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
CKY Mike, who thinks I should join you guys full-time, asked what game...

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
You want to move to Sacramento, then we'll talk.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
Yeah, I'll move to Sacramento.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
All right.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
How about that?

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
All right.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
What game demos did you get to download at the PSP booth?

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
I believe that's a Matt thing.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
That's a Loki thing.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
Go for it.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
Well, let's see.

37:16.000 --> 37:21.000
They have the Capcom Classic Collection Reloaded, I guess is what it's called now, and they

37:21.000 --> 37:27.000
only really had one stage from that, and that was actually Ghosts and Goblins, I guess.

37:27.000 --> 37:31.000
Then they had, let's see, Gangs of London was one of them.

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
They had Lemmings.

37:34.000 --> 37:39.000
The one I played, Every Extended Extra.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Yeah, Every Extended Extra.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
E3.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
And that was okay.

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
They had Ratchet and Clank, Size Matters.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
I played that for a little bit.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
That was okay.

37:49.000 --> 37:53.000
And then I can't remember the last game was.

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
It wasn't that standout.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Every Extended Extra seemed okay to me.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
It was weird.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
It was a little weird.

38:00.000 --> 38:04.000
It wasn't what I expected from Q Entertainment, but I think it'll be a good time.

38:04.000 --> 38:08.000
I like how they re-stamped or reused some of the sound effects from Luminous.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Yeah, that was funny.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
Dark Star?

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
No, I have an honorable mention.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Okay, yeah, let's do real quick though.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
We want to try and start wrapping this up.

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
We are going to take a couple quick phone calls though.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Bobby, tell them how to get in.

38:22.000 --> 38:28.000
Okay, you can call 1-866-880-0156.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
Soul-free number in the United States.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
Some quickies first.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
Dark Sakura.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
WTF.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
The WTF game is amazing.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
I chopped rabbits in half.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
It was great.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
I did the wood chopping game.

38:40.000 --> 38:45.000
It basically is a bunch of really, really messed up mini games.

38:45.000 --> 38:49.000
And the ones that Julie and I actually played was the wood chopping game

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
where you chop wood for money.

38:50.000 --> 38:54.000
Only the thing is that the grandma lady will randomly put out an animal.

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
The chicken sorting game was fantastic because you could do.

38:57.000 --> 39:02.000
You sort them as boys, girls, or dead.

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
No, it said heavenly.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
Because they're dead.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
That's why they go to heaven.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
But that's great.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
And that made me go WTF.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
It's a great time.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
All right, we've got to go.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
It was work time fun.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
Let's go to the telephone.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
Who's this?

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
Hi, it's Sephiroth1215.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
Sephiroth1215, what's on your mind?

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
We've got to make it quick tonight.

39:21.000 --> 39:28.000
Okay, I was going to say there has been a little bit of an update for the Imani booth.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Yeah, there's been a little bit.

39:30.000 --> 39:36.000
It said on Imani style that they brought Guitar Freaks, of course the response to Guitar Hero.

39:36.000 --> 39:41.000
UDX is there to show the press how cool the game would potentially be.

39:41.000 --> 39:45.000
And when they asked about another Beat Mania game for US,

39:45.000 --> 39:49.000
it said that it was too early for them to say whether or not it did well or not.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
I did not hear, you said Guitar Freaks broke?

39:52.000 --> 39:56.000
No, Guitar Freaks was a response to Guitar Hero.

39:56.000 --> 40:02.000
I think that they had Guitar Freaks and the Imani in there to have people come over to their booth.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
That was it.

40:04.000 --> 40:10.000
I think it was a press attention thing showing, I think they wanted to show, look at our arcade machines.

40:10.000 --> 40:13.000
Look at, we are bringing the arcade experience home.

40:13.000 --> 40:18.000
But the weird thing about that, I don't understand the logic of Guitar Freaks being there.

40:18.000 --> 40:24.000
I still don't, but maybe they want to show, hey, we've been doing this in the arcade for a long time.

40:24.000 --> 40:28.000
I'm not one to say why they have that there, if it is a response to Guitar Hero.

40:28.000 --> 40:34.000
Or maybe they're like me and seeing how non-innovative Guitar Hero is because it's been out forever in Japan as Guitar Freaks.

40:34.000 --> 40:39.000
See, but I disagree because I do think Guitar Hero is innovative, but in a different way than you do.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
Or you don't, I should say.

40:41.000 --> 40:46.000
And what was the other part of that you said that they were reporting, Sephiroth?

40:46.000 --> 40:55.000
They said that 2DX was there because they wanted to show the press how cool it would be and the potential that it could have.

41:17.000 --> 41:20.000
Nothing wrong with a little attention, right?

41:20.000 --> 41:33.000
Well, yeah. But the problem with that is they did say that they don't have any plans for another US sequel because they don't know whether or not it's sold well enough.

41:33.000 --> 41:41.000
Now, the problem I have with that is if I look back on DDR, I mean, they went on for a while and probably didn't sell well until maybe at least max.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
Actually, it did sell pretty well.

41:43.000 --> 41:48.000
Maybe that was the nice way of saying we just can't tell you anything right now.

41:48.000 --> 41:54.000
I think, honestly, that was the nice way of saying we can't talk about it.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
I hope so.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
Alright, we'll hope so too.

41:57.000 --> 42:00.000
Sephiroth, we gotta let you go to take another call. Thanks for calling, alright?

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
You're welcome.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
Alright, thanks.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
Alright.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
Oh, we got another one already?

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Loki, real quick before we answer this.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
Yes.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
Oh, I thought you had a comment.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
Hello?

42:09.000 --> 42:09.000
No.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
Alright, we'll go phone him.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
Hi! You're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
Hey, this is SilentWind96 again.

42:15.000 --> 42:20.000
SilentWind96. Nice to meet you last night. Congratulations.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Hey, thanks for getting in, guys.

42:22.000 --> 42:25.000
No problem. What'd you think of the E3 Outpost?

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Oh, I loved it. It was a lot of fun.

42:27.000 --> 42:32.000
Awesome. If you're in the LA area, come on down. We're right off Santa Monica in 405.

42:32.000 --> 42:36.000
What'd you call in about?

42:36.000 --> 42:42.000
Just calling to extend my thanks again for letting me hang out with you guys, and I'm on my way home back to Bakersfield.

42:42.000 --> 42:46.000
And I gotta be up at 3 o'clock in the morning to go to work.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Aw, poor guy.

42:48.000 --> 42:54.000
Well, thanks to the call. I'm glad you had a good time. What was something fun you did while you were here?

42:54.000 --> 43:08.000
Well, at the Outpost, I was able to talk to some of the guys from Intellivision and check out the demo for Lost Planet, which was awesome.

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
Yeah.

43:09.000 --> 43:16.000
And sat there and watched Bobby Platt, the security desk, kicked into UNO by the computer.

43:16.000 --> 43:22.000
That's right. Now, SilentWind96 brought us the full version of UNO for us to take a look at.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
And I love him for it.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
What did you guys think of UNO?

43:25.000 --> 43:34.000
Well, I had a little bit to drink. A little. And I was sitting back going, UNO. So, yeah.

43:34.000 --> 43:39.000
It was UNO. I had four Astra Smashes.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
Black Wolf?

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
What UNO?

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
UNO.

43:42.000 --> 43:45.000
The computer is a cheese monkey.

43:45.000 --> 43:49.000
The computer is a bitch. I'm sorry. The computer is evil.

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
Dark Star?

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
Yeah, go ahead.

43:52.000 --> 43:59.000
There are always pennies. I think he went four plays without even touching the controller.

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
That would be the first.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
You got dicked last night.

44:02.000 --> 44:03.000
The computer cheats.

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
Yeah.

44:04.000 --> 44:08.000
Yeah. It's just a matter of fact. The computer always cheats.

44:08.000 --> 44:11.000
Dark Soccer and I were having an interesting conversation in the bus.

44:11.000 --> 44:16.000
Why play UNO online when you can get a deck of cards and play with your friends?

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
Because then I couldn't play UNO with Skye.

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
Aww.

44:20.000 --> 44:21.000
That makes me warm and fuzzy.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
That makes me warm and fuzzy and kind of ill.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
No, I'm just kidding. I'm kidding.

44:25.000 --> 44:29.000
All right. No, that was my thought, too.

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
I'm going to have to get my own gamertag now.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
You should.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
Yeah.

44:34.000 --> 44:37.000
Silent Wind, any other thoughts for our listeners?

44:37.000 --> 44:41.000
No, just if you ever get a chance to go down there, that's a great place to hang out.

44:41.000 --> 44:47.000
The staff is awesome and Lawrence and Skye were really accommodating.

44:47.000 --> 44:54.000
It's good to put a face on the voice that you hear all the time.

44:54.000 --> 44:59.000
I finally found an iPod and that's all I got here is a podcast from all you guys.

44:59.000 --> 45:03.000
I appreciate your support. You're a true buddy.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
And what do you think of the set here?

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
I love this set.

45:06.000 --> 45:10.000
Silent Wind, what did you think of the set?

45:10.000 --> 45:13.000
Oh, I love the NES. The NES set was awesome.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
I did take pictures with Skye's camera.

45:15.000 --> 45:18.000
Oh, good. We'll get those up on the site. Thank you.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
All right. Silent Wind, we've got to let you go because we're going to get more calls.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
Thanks for calling in, all right?

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
All right. You take care now.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
All right. You too, buddy.

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
It's good to meet you.

45:25.000 --> 45:29.000
All right. That was Silent Wind, our random contest winner from last night.

45:29.000 --> 45:33.000
You have to come down here and be on the E3 Outpost.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
Check it out here.

45:36.000 --> 45:39.000
Bobby, remind the kids how to call in if they want. We'll do a couple more.

45:39.000 --> 45:47.000
Toll-free number in the United States, 1-866-880-0156.

45:47.000 --> 45:51.000
I wanted to mention another cool game I played was Hot Pixel.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
That game was awesome.

45:52.000 --> 45:58.000
It's just basically WarioWare on the PSP with old retro Atari games in there as well.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
Freaking awesome.

45:59.000 --> 46:02.000
Lots of good WarioWare-type games coming to the PSP.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
You mean Atari was showing more than one game?

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
Yeah.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
Wow.

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
Hot Pixel?

46:08.000 --> 46:09.000
Hot Pixel.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.000
It's fun.

46:10.000 --> 46:14.000
And the guy, I guess, who made it or whatever is some crazy-ass French guy.

46:14.000 --> 46:19.000
I mean, he has this weird skateboard with carpet on it and a fucking PSP holder in there.

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
What a nut.

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
But you know what?

46:21.000 --> 46:22.000
It was cool.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
It was nice to meet him.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
He actually has a podcast, too.

46:26.000 --> 46:30.000
I don't even remember the name of it, but just a weird guy.

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
He's kind of like Mark Echoes on Kraken French.

46:33.000 --> 46:38.000
Eccentric guy, but I was surprised with Hot Pixel, I thought it would suck.

46:38.000 --> 46:46.000
But it was actually kind of, it was cute in a, I don't even know how to describe it.

46:46.000 --> 46:51.000
It was such a weird, quirky, but in a different type of element.

46:51.000 --> 46:57.000
I mean, the game is totally just like WarioWare, but the minigames are so different.

46:57.000 --> 46:58.000
That's what I like about it.

46:58.000 --> 47:01.000
I don't know.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
I have another quickie for you guys.

47:03.000 --> 47:08.000
99 Nights, I thought was great.

47:08.000 --> 47:12.000
I thought, it's just mass murder of the game.

47:12.000 --> 47:15.000
I loved it.

47:15.000 --> 47:24.000
It's a little bit of button mashing, but I mean, there's a lot of stuff going on on the screen.

47:24.000 --> 47:25.000
Gamer Andy's doing a dance.

47:25.000 --> 47:26.000
Gamer Andy's already drunk.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Is this the 99 Nights dance?

47:28.000 --> 47:31.000
Gamer Andy, say hi on Orange Lounge Radio, do a plug for your spiel.

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
Tell us about 99 Nights.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Hi Gamer Andy, what's on your mind?

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
Hi, this is Adam from Gamer Andy Live.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
How are you today?

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
I am great.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
That's great.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
What do you think of 99 Nights?

47:40.000 --> 47:44.000
You know, I played it at the Spring preview and I honestly thought it was more along the

47:44.000 --> 47:48.000
realms of the button mashing, Dynasty Warriors-esque sort of thing.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Which personally isn't really for me.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
Did you like it?

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
No, no dude.

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
Didn't like the cut scenes?

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
Didn't like any of that stuff?

47:55.000 --> 47:59.000
Um, you know, the cut scenes were alright, but honestly I really just didn't quite get

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
into it.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
It wasn't my groove, dude.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
Sorry to hear it.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
Yeah, you know, I mean, I wanted to like it though.

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
Alright, give a quick plug for your stuff.

48:08.000 --> 48:11.000
Gamer Andy Live, tonight, after these guys.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
After Orange Lounge Radio, which rocks by the way.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Thank you, appreciate it.

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
Alright.

48:16.000 --> 48:17.000
He's drunk.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
We gotta give the mic back to Jamie now.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Alright, um.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
I had business.

48:23.000 --> 48:26.000
I like, 99 Nights is a little bit of button mashing.

48:26.000 --> 48:29.000
It's like Golden Axe, but like, I don't know.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
That was what I was thinking about when I'm playing.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
This is like Golden Axe, but with more.

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
I don't know.

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
I see Sonic.

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
Right.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
Uh, Mortal Kombat Armageddon.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Did anyone else play this besides me?

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
Hell no.

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
You are a green vampire chick with an axe.

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
Created character is always awesome in my book.

48:47.000 --> 48:52.000
And even though I'm a little disappointed Armageddon is only for the current gen stuff,

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
I think created character was great.

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
I made it.

48:55.000 --> 49:00.000
Of course the created character that was in there when I loaded it up was the naked woman.

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
But how many of those have we seen?

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
I mean, when I say naked I mean, you know, bikini.

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
But how many of those have we seen in video games?

49:05.000 --> 49:08.000
So I was gonna make a fun female character.

49:08.000 --> 49:14.000
So I made a green vampire bitch with a huge meat cleaver as her weapon and it was awesome.

49:14.000 --> 49:15.000
And you won.

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
I did.

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
I kicked the shit out of whoever.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
I don't even remember what I was playing against.

49:19.000 --> 49:22.000
Ermac or something, but it was cool.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
I liked it.

49:24.000 --> 49:31.000
I think it's a little like if you have the other two Mortal Kombat games from this current generation.

49:31.000 --> 49:34.000
I don't think there's a lot else here.

49:34.000 --> 49:41.000
But I mean, if you're a fan of Mortal Kombat, I think you'll have a good time.

49:41.000 --> 49:42.000
Any other?

49:42.000 --> 49:43.000
Oh, we got a call.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
Let's go to the phones and answer the phones.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
Hey, Jason.

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
Hey, Jason.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
What's up?

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
How are you guys enjoying the game?

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
Good.

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
This is Jason, our webmaster, Jason.

49:56.000 --> 49:57.000
Hi, Jason.

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
We miss having you here.

49:58.000 --> 49:59.000
Why?

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
I wish you were here, Jason.

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
Why aren't you here?

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
I'm not here.

50:02.000 --> 50:06.000
I'm not there because my truck demands me being here.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
Oh, I'm sorry, Jason.

50:07.000 --> 50:11.000
I'm getting insurance and all those things that actually require money for no good reason.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Oh, I hate that stuff.

50:13.000 --> 50:17.000
What did you want to call in and say to our listeners besides the fact that you rock?

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
Because you do our website stuff for us.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
It's a thankless job, and I love you for it.

50:22.000 --> 50:23.000
You know that.

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
What did you want to say to our listeners?

50:26.000 --> 50:31.000
I heard about the existence of, you know, Guitar Man Live, and I'm wondering if they've

50:31.000 --> 50:35.000
actually kind of put this up and if you guys have gotten any more information on it.

50:35.000 --> 50:38.000
Guitar Man Live, we got into a little bit yesterday.

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
It's Guitar Man Lives.

50:39.000 --> 50:40.000
Lives, yeah.

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
Lives, whatever.

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
It's a port.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
It's Guitar...

50:43.000 --> 50:44.000
It's a port.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
It's the same thing as the PS2 with the...

50:46.000 --> 50:47.000
It has duet mode.

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
It's a port.

50:48.000 --> 50:52.000
It's some little things, but if you're looking for new songs...

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
No.

50:53.000 --> 50:54.000
No.

50:54.000 --> 50:55.000
Sorry to say.

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
But if you accidentally pause it, you can continue.

50:57.000 --> 51:00.000
You don't have to restart from the beginning.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
Andy, that was always a nuisance with, uh...

51:02.000 --> 51:03.000
Right.

51:03.000 --> 51:06.000
With the groove, and if you actually played it on a dance pad and were a silly person

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
like me, cool.

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
Yeah.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Anything else, Jason?

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
Uh, not really.

51:12.000 --> 51:16.000
I was hoping that it was mostly a new game, especially with the duet mode.

51:16.000 --> 51:20.000
It was actually going to further the storyline or anything along those lines.

51:20.000 --> 51:24.000
We were a little disappointed it's not a new game either, but at least the franchise isn't

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
dead.

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
I guess that's the silver lining.

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
At least they're still interested.

51:27.000 --> 51:28.000
Very true.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
So we'll see how it does on the market.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
Excellent.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
Jason, thanks so much for calling in.

51:33.000 --> 51:34.000
Have a good one, okay?

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
Thank you.

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
All right.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Hey, you know, I checked out another neat game today.

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
What's that?

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Uh, Shin Megami Tensei.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
And real quickly, what's that about?

51:43.000 --> 51:49.000
Well, um, it's sort of like a detective game with fighting zombies.

51:49.000 --> 51:52.000
You'll have to tell us more about that after this call.

51:52.000 --> 51:53.000
Yeah.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
Hi, you're on Orange Mountains Radio.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
Hello?

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
Hi, who's this?

51:56.000 --> 52:00.000
I can't hear the caller.

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
I can't hear the caller.

52:01.000 --> 52:02.000
What's your name, buddy?

52:02.000 --> 52:03.000
Try again.

52:03.000 --> 52:04.000
DJ Pooh Eater.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
DJ Pooh Eater.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Oh, DJ Pooh Eater!

52:07.000 --> 52:08.000
Hey!

52:08.000 --> 52:09.000
Hey!

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
What's on your mind?

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
You're breaking up a little bit, so get your thought out.

52:13.000 --> 52:17.000
I want to know that anymore.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
I didn't catch that.

52:19.000 --> 52:23.000
DJ Pooh Eater, we're going to have to let you go, buddy.

52:23.000 --> 52:26.000
DJ Pooh Eater, we're going to have to let you go because you're breaking up too much.

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
But thanks for trying.

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
Maybe try again tomorrow.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
All right.

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
Have a good one.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
All right.

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
Are we?

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
Let's go to another call.

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
Let's try a different call.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
Oh, they hung up.

52:37.000 --> 52:38.000
Yeah.

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
Oh, here it is again.

52:39.000 --> 52:40.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

52:40.000 --> 52:43.000
Hi, this is Jade at 2006.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Jade at 2006.

52:45.000 --> 52:46.000
Hey!

52:46.000 --> 52:47.000
What's on your mind, buddy?

52:47.000 --> 52:48.000
Oh, nothing much.

52:48.000 --> 52:51.000
This is mainly a question for Bobby.

52:51.000 --> 52:52.000
Bobby!

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
A question for Bobby.

52:54.000 --> 52:55.000
Uh-oh.

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
Bobby taking over our show.

52:56.000 --> 52:57.000
Thanks a lot.

52:57.000 --> 52:58.000
Noah, what's up?

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
What's the question for Bobby?

53:00.000 --> 53:04.000
What is your honest opinion about Wii Music?

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
Okay, the Wii Music was just the Wii Orchestra.

53:06.000 --> 53:10.000
They had a drum game, but it was closed off, even to media.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
Like, you had to actually have an appointment to play it.

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
But the orchestra...

53:13.000 --> 53:14.000
I'm glad Matt was the orchestra.

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
Yeah, the orchestra...

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Okay, here's the thing.

53:17.000 --> 53:22.000
I was having trouble with it because I've actually conducted an orchestra before.

53:22.000 --> 53:27.000
And it's sometimes too sensitive, sometimes not sensitive enough.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
But all it was was playing the Zelda theme.

53:29.000 --> 53:33.000
And yeah, you can cue other places.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
You can cue the back of the orchestra and they'll play louder.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
You know, you can slow them down and start them up.

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
But it takes a little while to get used to it.

53:39.000 --> 53:40.000
I only played through it twice.

53:40.000 --> 53:44.000
When you play that game, do you look as fruity as Miyamoto did at the conference?

53:44.000 --> 53:45.000
No, I actually look...

53:45.000 --> 53:46.000
I look like a real...

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
Most people do.

53:47.000 --> 53:51.000
They're like, you know, just waving their arms and like dancing around like he did.

53:51.000 --> 53:55.000
You know, when I say Miyamoto's being fruity, I tease with love.

53:55.000 --> 53:59.000
Because that's why we love him is because he's just a crazy little man.

53:59.000 --> 54:04.000
Just to point out though, you're mentioning about having a hard time actually conducting

54:04.000 --> 54:05.000
for real with it.

54:05.000 --> 54:06.000
I did also...

54:06.000 --> 54:09.000
When I went through there, Koji Kondo was playing.

54:09.000 --> 54:12.000
And he actually, I can tell, wasn't doing true conducting.

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
Right.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
Yeah, you have to do it like, you know, it's really rigid.

54:15.000 --> 54:19.000
And it looks like it's actually, if you know anything about like conducting,

54:19.000 --> 54:22.000
it's actually the up motion is what triggers it, not the down motion.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
I learned that like right at the very end of my second thing.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
I'm like, oh, it's going on the up.

54:26.000 --> 54:27.000
All right.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
J to 2006.

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
Any other thoughts for us?

54:30.000 --> 54:34.000
Is it as easy as Miyamoto made it look? How about that?

54:34.000 --> 54:35.000
Yeah.

54:35.000 --> 54:38.000
I mean, you're not going to be good at it, but yeah, I mean, it's, you know,

54:38.000 --> 54:42.000
waving your arms like people who've never done music stuff were able to get through it.

54:42.000 --> 54:43.000
All right.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
And it does score you at the end.

54:45.000 --> 54:46.000
J to...

54:46.000 --> 54:47.000
Oh, wonderful.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
J to 2006.

54:48.000 --> 54:49.000
We got to let you go.

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
We're going to start wrapping it up.

54:50.000 --> 54:51.000
All right?

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
Okay.

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
All right.

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
Thanks so much for the call.

54:54.000 --> 54:55.000
Have a good one.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.000
Have a good one too.

54:56.000 --> 54:57.000
All right.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
Well, Poor Spirit Snare has been trying to call in for like the past 30 minutes.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
And if somebody else always gets in...

55:01.000 --> 55:05.000
Well, we got the wrap-up sign, so we got to start wrapping it up.

55:05.000 --> 55:08.000
Spirit Snare, tomorrow, buddy, call in.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
We'll get you.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
I'm so sorry.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
But of course, there's always the forums.

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
There's live journal.

55:13.000 --> 55:16.000
This is for anybody that wants to talk to us, but maybe is too shy to call in.

55:16.000 --> 55:20.000
Our stuff blog, stuff.orangelandrater.com.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Even MySpace if you really want to.

55:22.000 --> 55:25.000
We've got all that stuff going on, so check it out.

55:25.000 --> 55:28.000
Anyway, really quickly though, real quick, I had to do this for the shows overnight.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
The FUs of the week.

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
Bobby, give us a little bit of the...

55:32.000 --> 55:35.000
All right.

55:35.000 --> 55:36.000
All right.

55:36.000 --> 55:39.000
Dark Sakura, do you have any FUs so far at E3?

55:39.000 --> 55:42.000
Not really, actually.

55:42.000 --> 55:43.000
Really?

55:43.000 --> 55:44.000
Yeah.

55:44.000 --> 55:49.000
I've actually been pretty much okay with it, except I still think...

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
And this actually really surprised me.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
My husband's actually pretty happy about it.

55:52.000 --> 56:01.000
I want to say FU to Capcom, because why the hell are you going to put NES Strider on the PSP?

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
Oh, they put NES Strider on the PSP?

56:03.000 --> 56:04.000
Yeah.

56:04.000 --> 56:12.000
That Capcom classics collection is the NES versions of Mighty Final Fight, Bionic Commando,

56:12.000 --> 56:19.000
which Dan was like, Bionic Commando, and the NES version of Strider, which actually isn't a bad game.

56:19.000 --> 56:22.000
It's all based off of the Strider comics.

56:22.000 --> 56:25.000
But I was like, I have these at home.

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
I can just play them at home.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Why do I want these on my PSP?

56:29.000 --> 56:32.000
But what about those of us who don't have those at home?

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
Is it a bad thing to have?

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
You can download it.

56:36.000 --> 56:39.000
So it is a bad thing to have if we don't have those games at home.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
There's other ways to get it.

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
I just don't see any reason to...

56:42.000 --> 56:48.000
They should have touched it up or made it a little bit cleaner, and it is an exact port of the NES ones.

56:48.000 --> 56:49.000
Some people like that.

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
We gotta keep the angst flowing, because we gotta wrap it up.

56:52.000 --> 56:53.000
Loki, your F.U.

56:53.000 --> 56:56.000
My F.U. goes to Nintendo for a couple reasons.

56:56.000 --> 57:01.000
The first, because their party wasn't exactly great, even if the black IPs were there,

57:01.000 --> 57:05.000
and also because their booth sucks ass as far as the design goes,

57:05.000 --> 57:09.000
and it makes it nearly impossible to play anything new that they have.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
Notice I didn't talk about the Wii today.

57:11.000 --> 57:12.000
That's because I didn't play it.

57:12.000 --> 57:17.000
I tried to go to the line at 1230, and they told me, tough titty, because...

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
It closed at 10 o'clock.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
They were doing a private party, which was more important.

57:21.000 --> 57:22.000
Closed at 10.

57:22.000 --> 57:25.000
Do your private party after hours.

57:25.000 --> 57:26.000
Dummies.

57:26.000 --> 57:27.000
Closed at 10 o'clock.

57:27.000 --> 57:28.000
Bobby, your F.U.

57:28.000 --> 57:34.000
My F.U. goes to three people, and one of them, his name is Scott Rubin,

57:34.000 --> 57:38.000
who was supposed to be the one that was picking me up at 8.15 in the morning at my hotel,

57:38.000 --> 57:41.000
so I could get there by 9 o'clock.

57:41.000 --> 57:47.000
Unfortunately, he misjudged L.A. traffic and got to my hotel at 8.45,

57:47.000 --> 57:50.000
and so that meant that I got to the convention center at 9.30.

57:50.000 --> 57:58.000
My second F.U. goes to Redmond Carpolio from the Los Angeles newspaper group...

57:58.000 --> 58:01.000
Who, by the way, is standing right in front of Bobby right now.

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
I know this is radio.

58:03.000 --> 58:04.000
...who pulled some strings.

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
He was standing in the Nintendo line.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
I was going to join him in the line, and he pulled some strings,

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
and they went into the Nintendo booth.

58:10.000 --> 58:13.000
And my third F.U. goes to Lawrence Young for going with him

58:13.000 --> 58:16.000
and not waiting for me because they did the Jack Bauer time going,

58:16.000 --> 58:19.000
There's no time!

58:19.000 --> 58:24.000
And then for Lawrence Young, the last F.U. was for calling me and saying,

58:24.000 --> 58:31.000
Bobby B., I'm one foot away from Madden 07.

58:31.000 --> 58:34.000
And I was like an hour and a half away from getting in, so...

58:34.000 --> 58:37.000
I still love you, Lawrence, for whatever it's worth.

58:37.000 --> 58:41.000
You edit the show so I don't have to. I love you for that.

58:41.000 --> 58:47.000
My F.U. goes to the people that were waiting in line to see Paris Hilton.

58:47.000 --> 58:51.000
Get out of my E3! Get out!

58:51.000 --> 58:54.000
Those are the people that need to be sterilized.

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
Why would you stand in line to see her? Why?

58:56.000 --> 59:01.000
It's a goddamn mobile game, too. Why? Shame on you.

59:01.000 --> 59:04.000
That's a double negative, which is not a positive. That's a double bad thing.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
A curse on all your houses.

59:06.000 --> 59:10.000
A curse on your people. I hope you all go sterile.

59:10.000 --> 59:13.000
Yes. May they never breed.

59:13.000 --> 59:16.000
We gotta wrap it up. Final thoughts. Dark Soccer, your final thought.

59:16.000 --> 59:19.000
Uh...nap.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Loki, your final thought.

59:21.000 --> 59:25.000
My final thought is I'm gonna play Crackdown tomorrow because I forgot it was there.

59:25.000 --> 59:29.000
Bobby, thanks for being here again. Your final thought.

59:29.000 --> 59:30.000
Reject false icons.

59:30.000 --> 59:31.000
Thank you.

59:31.000 --> 59:34.000
I also forgot to mention, two nights in a row,

59:34.000 --> 59:39.000
Superman Returns is fucking awesome, and it would be a better Grand Theft Auto game.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
Yeah!

59:41.000 --> 59:45.000
My final thought is Enchanted Arms looks really pretty. I wish they'd let me play it.

59:45.000 --> 59:46.000
Yeah.

59:46.000 --> 59:51.000
Alright. That's it. We gotta go, guys. We'll be back here Friday night live at the E3 Outpost.

59:51.000 --> 59:56.000
Thanks to the E3 Outpost staff for having us. If you're listening live, Gamer Andy's up next.

59:56.000 --> 01:00:01.000
So don't go anywhere or he will come find you and disco dance at your living room.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
They can take a quick pee break if they need to.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000
That's scary. Yeah, you can do a quick pee break, but be back here by 9.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Be back by 9 Pacific. Alright, roll the credits. We're done.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000
