WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:19.480
Tonight, January 29th, 2006, we speak with Rick Sanchez, Vice President of Content for

00:19.480 --> 00:24.280
GameTap, his World of Warcraft against gay and lesbian guilds, and we give you a complete

00:24.280 --> 00:31.280
wrap-up of Konami Gamer's Day.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.920
Welcome everybody to another week here on Orange Lounge Radio. It is Sunday,

00:36.920 --> 00:39.640
January 29th and you're listening to

00:39.640 --> 00:43.480
Orange Lounge Radio or maybe if you're listening to this the podcast way, it's

00:43.480 --> 00:46.520
any day you want because the podcast thing lets you do that.

00:46.520 --> 00:49.680
Anyway we are here to talk about video games and all the news you really want to

00:49.680 --> 00:50.240
know about.

00:50.240 --> 00:54.160
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky. Joining me as always, say hello

00:54.160 --> 01:01.240
to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers with off microphone. That's alright.

01:01.240 --> 01:06.840
Dang it, this has just been like crap week, so forgive me for being a little flustered.

01:06.840 --> 01:09.120
That's alright, how you doing besides crap and flustered?

01:09.120 --> 01:16.720
I'm in pain, because I worked out. I did not play a game, but worked out yesterday like

01:16.720 --> 01:19.640
a good girl. I went to the gym, but I was gaming all the rest of the week.

01:19.640 --> 01:22.420
Well we'll get to gaming in just a minute, but it would be rude of me not to introduce

01:22.420 --> 01:23.420
Here's the one and only Loki.

01:23.420 --> 01:24.420
Hi.

01:24.420 --> 01:25.420
Hi, Loki.

01:25.420 --> 01:26.420
How you doing?

01:26.420 --> 01:27.420
Frustrated.

01:27.420 --> 01:29.420
I couldn't get on a motorcycle for some reason.

01:29.420 --> 01:32.980
They were too fast for my character in Grand Theft Auto Liberty City.

01:32.980 --> 01:35.980
Oh, at first I was like, you ride motorcycles?

01:35.980 --> 01:37.980
You have a class A license?

01:37.980 --> 01:38.980
No.

01:38.980 --> 01:39.980
No.

01:39.980 --> 01:44.100
So, because I think I put the aggressive driver's code in before I got a motorcycle and so it

01:44.100 --> 01:46.420
made it a little bit tougher to get one.

01:46.420 --> 01:47.420
Okay.

01:47.420 --> 01:50.140
Well, sorry to hear it.

01:50.140 --> 01:53.660
Also joining us since once in a while we'd like to invite a special guest on to fill

01:53.660 --> 01:56.400
out our fourth chair here in the studio.

01:56.400 --> 01:59.840
Say hello to Miklotov, who was just here two weeks ago.

01:59.840 --> 02:00.840
Two weeks ago, yes.

02:00.840 --> 02:01.840
But he's back.

02:01.840 --> 02:02.840
Hello.

02:02.840 --> 02:03.840
How you doing?

02:03.840 --> 02:04.840
Fine.

02:04.840 --> 02:05.840
Yeah?

02:05.840 --> 02:06.840
Yep.

02:06.840 --> 02:08.840
Miklotov, for those that don't know, works for Konami, but his role is top secret, so

02:08.840 --> 02:10.040
we don't really talk about Konami.

02:10.040 --> 02:12.160
Actually, we have a lot of Konami to talk about tonight.

02:12.160 --> 02:13.800
Yeah, it makes me sad, too.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.920
You'll just have to roll your eyes at the whole thing, I guess, or turn your back.

02:16.920 --> 02:19.560
I just said I didn't get to go.

02:19.560 --> 02:23.000
talk about that a little later okay that's that's that's our two oh our two

02:23.000 --> 02:28.560
okay all right anyway um welcome everybody and I hope you enjoyed the

02:28.560 --> 02:32.640
show last week you got a lot of good feedback and stuff um we're gonna start

02:32.640 --> 02:36.640
off tonight's program as we always do playing a little bit of how is your

02:36.640 --> 02:40.120
gaming week and since um we feel like doing things different tonight we're

02:40.120 --> 02:42.960
gonna go in a reverse order a different order than usual so we'll start with

02:42.960 --> 02:46.160
miklotov what kind of games did you play this week anything exciting I played a

02:46.160 --> 02:52.400
lot of World of Warcraft especially this weekend that's it how's how's the World

02:52.400 --> 02:57.340
of Warcraft going for you it's actually going good it's kind of fun having a

02:57.340 --> 03:00.940
good time mm-hmm I like that I don't have to party but I also hate that I

03:00.940 --> 03:06.560
don't have to party mm-hmm and beyond that I got giddy this week when they

03:06.560 --> 03:11.360
announced that pirate or Corsair was a job class now in Final Fantasy 11 oh

03:11.360 --> 03:14.200
yeah expansion path I heard about this in the expansion back that they're gonna

03:14.200 --> 03:18.040
be doing it's like it's it's blue mage and and corsair or saying we don't know

03:18.040 --> 03:21.280
what else yet okay but a corsair is pretty much a pirate right with gambler

03:21.280 --> 03:24.800
also mixed in okay so so let me get this right

03:24.800 --> 03:28.640
Final Fantasy 11 has a job class for ninja yeah and now they have a job class

03:28.640 --> 03:32.800
for pirate yes so now you're gonna have ninja versus pirates or ninja slash

03:32.800 --> 03:36.000
pirates or pirate slash name doesn't that throw off the balance of the

03:36.000 --> 03:39.680
universe though to have a ninja and then like pirate is your sub job no higher

03:39.680 --> 03:43.400
than the ninja that's wrong that's like a conflict of interest no because I get

03:43.400 --> 03:47.920
along everybody knows they really get along it's just it's like the you know

03:47.920 --> 03:53.240
what's those Hicks that fought all the time the Hatfields and McCoy yeah those

03:53.240 --> 03:57.240
people they probably really got along it's just like pirates and ninjas but if

03:57.240 --> 04:02.840
they didn't have a fight the Pirates would win so so now for those that don't

04:02.840 --> 04:05.920
know me glitov which I imagine most people don't you you are infatuated with

04:05.920 --> 04:10.240
the color blue you love yes yes I do so but you're not gonna play a blue mate

04:10.240 --> 04:15.340
No, I'm gonna play a corsair because it's a pirate that makes no sense. So pirates rank outrank blue things for you

04:15.340 --> 04:20.040
Um in this game, yes, for some reason they gave a blue mage really crappy armor

04:20.140 --> 04:24.480
It looks really stupid but a pirate looks like a pirate and that's all that matters. So

04:25.240 --> 04:27.320
I'm sure I can get blue pirate armor. I'll be happy

04:28.200 --> 04:33.160
Okay, I really don't know how to follow that up. So anything else you want to share? I played more Mario Kart

04:33.160 --> 04:37.520
I'm up to how many wins do you have there like 1500? Yeah 1500 something. You're sad

04:37.520 --> 04:42.320
I think some of our chatters are playing are trying to get a game of Mario Kart DS going on right now

04:42.320 --> 04:49.520
Oh, well, they're cool, except they're playing online. So it sucks OrangeLoungeRadio.com click on chat if you want to join in the fun

04:50.880 --> 04:55.920
Why why does online suck because you can only have four people and then whoever doesn't get first place

04:56.120 --> 05:02.840
Always drops out for the next race. So by the third race you're by yourself. Do you do that snaking thing?

05:02.840 --> 05:08.400
No, because I think it's stupid. Okay, I was just curious and people snake around the course and Mario Kart DS

05:08.400 --> 05:11.920
It's really it's really annoying. Yeah, it's irritating. Yep. All right

05:12.920 --> 05:18.640
Loki how was your gaming week? I played lots of Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories

05:18.640 --> 05:25.000
I a little bit of need for speed most wanted on the 360 a little bit Call of Duty 2 on the 360 and

05:26.400 --> 05:28.400
Animal Crossing DS

05:28.400 --> 05:31.400
Just, how's life in Animal Crossing?

05:31.400 --> 05:33.400
I'm about to pay off.

05:33.400 --> 05:36.400
I'm not even sure what mortgage it is.

05:36.400 --> 05:40.400
It's basically the second room in the house.

05:40.400 --> 05:43.400
So I have one extra room.

05:43.400 --> 05:45.400
Now I'm going to get a second extra room.

05:45.400 --> 05:48.400
And then there's one more extra room and then I'm done.

05:48.400 --> 05:49.400
Awesome.

05:49.400 --> 05:55.400
So I have like a hundred and some thousand dollars worth of foreign fruit in my village.

05:55.400 --> 05:59.480
village we got rid of all the really annoying characters they moved away now

05:59.480 --> 06:00.280
we have like

06:00.280 --> 06:03.880
bears we have one that's called blue bear it looks like a care bear

06:03.880 --> 06:07.080
and I don't like it so it's gonna have to move because I'll start sending

06:07.080 --> 06:10.560
evil messages is that how you get your characters to move cuz to get mine to

06:10.560 --> 06:11.640
move I just don't talk to them

06:11.640 --> 06:14.880
you're just not supposed to talk to them? I just ignore them

06:14.880 --> 06:19.440
and when they try to run when they try to run up to talk to me I run away

06:19.440 --> 06:22.440
I just out them and then that usually does it

06:22.440 --> 06:25.560
You know, I accuse them of having, you know,

06:25.560 --> 06:30.920
gay orgies and stuff like that, and usually they get embarrassed and move away.

06:30.920 --> 06:35.040
Alright, anything else you want to share about your gaming week?

06:35.040 --> 06:39.200
Um, no. No, that's pretty much it.

06:39.200 --> 06:42.440
I didn't play much else. Alright, I'll go next then.

06:42.440 --> 06:45.640
My gaming week actually wasn't that exciting. I did play a little bit of

06:45.640 --> 06:46.600
World of Warcraft.

06:46.600 --> 06:51.040
I played Silent Hill 4 at the request of Miklotov earlier today. For five minutes.

06:51.040 --> 06:55.360
like five minutes no it's a little longer than that six minutes no it was

06:55.360 --> 06:59.240
like a good half hour no no is that it was like cuz remember you made me load

06:59.240 --> 07:03.000
the one game that I left off like a year and a half ago and I started playing it

07:03.000 --> 07:05.280
going I have no idea what the hell's going on cuz it's been like a year and a

07:05.280 --> 07:07.960
half since I touched this game so then I was like okay I'm gonna go back and

07:07.960 --> 07:12.280
start over and then I you know I made a pretty good progress you got to reverse

07:12.280 --> 07:19.520
were 15 minutes of playing I like Silent Hill 4 though it's a good game and

07:19.520 --> 07:22.980
And uh, Meteos. I've been playing the crap out of Meteos.

07:22.980 --> 07:27.380
I love Meteos, it's a great game. And uh, I'm trying to unlock every single planet right now.

07:27.380 --> 07:30.740
And I only have like four left to go. So I'm doing really well, I'd like to say.

07:30.740 --> 07:34.460
I'm very proud of my accomplishments there. And um,

07:34.460 --> 07:37.780
that's about it for me. DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

07:37.780 --> 07:42.860
Um, I got a Game Boy Micro this week. Oh, and the itty bitty, itty bitty ones!

07:42.860 --> 07:46.140
What's your face plate look like? Um, it's the plain black one.

07:46.140 --> 07:49.860
Oh. How boring! It's dark like my soul! How boring!

07:49.860 --> 07:53.820
No, I like it. It was- I'm not gonna complain because it's free.

07:53.820 --> 07:57.860
Yeah, it's- I'm not going to say how I obtained it either. Oh, really?

07:57.860 --> 08:01.980
Through natharious means. My, you know, pact with the dark powers.

08:01.980 --> 08:08.620
Okay. You're kinda scaring me here a little bit. And we got a free copy of Pokemon Emerald with it too.

08:08.620 --> 08:12.060
Oh, that's cool. But I took it out from promptly input in YY Racing.

08:12.060 --> 08:15.180
Can you actually read text on those little things? Because- Yes!

08:15.180 --> 08:18.460
I played the hell out of space Harrier on that thing really

08:18.460 --> 08:21.640
yep I love me some space Harrier I have

08:21.640 --> 08:25.360
I have really yet to really sit down with a micro I saw it at E3 and that was about it

08:25.360 --> 08:30.060
I'll let you play it during the break. Cool my opinion of it has not changed one bit

08:30.060 --> 08:34.140
when I remember looking at it E3 I'm like wow this is the most useless thing I've

08:34.140 --> 08:34.900
ever seen

08:34.900 --> 08:39.060
it's actually pretty cool and I like it cuz I can

08:39.060 --> 08:42.180
just carry it with me wherever cuz it's little and it will fit in my pocket

08:42.180 --> 08:46.100
because it's a fashion accessory like something Paris Hilton would have hanging

08:46.100 --> 08:46.820
from her purse

08:46.820 --> 08:50.360
no cuz Paris Hilton- like you have hanging from your cell phone oh no it's- Paris Hilton is a

08:50.360 --> 08:51.020
stupid whore

08:51.020 --> 08:54.420
alright look correction

08:54.420 --> 08:58.260
stupid spoiled whore oh it's kinda cute- it is so cute

08:58.260 --> 09:01.740

09:31.820 --> 09:32.420
fourth loan

09:32.420 --> 09:35.660
uh-huh and I'll get my fifth loan paid off

09:35.660 --> 09:38.660
I'm actually making sure I'm doing it to where I'm paying off a hundred thousand a week

09:38.660 --> 09:42.500
because I wanna pace myself so the game still entertaining for both you guys

09:42.500 --> 09:45.700

09:45.700 --> 09:50.180

10:20.380 --> 10:26.480
Um, no, not really. Is it just me or is, is tonight a little bit of an off night? I think we

10:26.480 --> 10:29.380
all feel like a little bit, I was very, very sick yesterday, I got

10:29.380 --> 10:33.180
really, really sick last night, and I'll get into that when I get into the FUs of the week, but

10:33.180 --> 10:34.380
that's the reason I'm off.

10:34.380 --> 10:38.340
I know Jamie's off a little bit. She talked about that earlier in the show. I told someone off today

10:38.340 --> 10:40.340
Did you do why would what did they do?

10:40.380 --> 10:42.380
food woman

10:42.620 --> 10:47.680
For being a woman is that why you told her off. I was hanging out with Tia today. Uh-huh, and this woman shoved Tia

10:48.660 --> 10:51.500
And I was like you can say excuse me

10:52.260 --> 10:57.660
She's all like I did very softly. I'm like well next time Sam where people can hear you

10:58.340 --> 11:02.540
And then she got behind us in line and said you some people need to clean out here

11:02.540 --> 11:04.540
I said some people need to learn how to speak up

11:04.860 --> 11:08.620
Where was this at Barnes & Noble? Oh, we were buying tarot cards

11:08.620 --> 11:11.660
Are you were you trying to start a fight in the middle of Barnes & Noble? No

11:13.100 --> 11:15.300
She was just using her library voice

11:15.980 --> 11:21.620
Yes, she was using her library voice. She was right behind us and I could not hear her and I have good hearing

11:24.140 --> 11:26.400
Wait, I'm gonna put that theory to the test. Hold on

11:27.620 --> 11:29.620
Jamie sucks. I

11:29.620 --> 11:35.100
I know you do moving on

11:35.100 --> 11:38.500
let's get into some actual news shall we

11:38.500 --> 11:43.620
Loki while I beat up Jamie could you tell us a little bit about what's going

11:43.620 --> 11:45.260
on with the Nintendo DS

11:45.260 --> 11:48.460
I'm gonna use my library voice and I do it either

11:48.460 --> 11:52.140
okay so the DS it was yes we're redesigning it then

11:52.140 --> 11:56.140
no we're redesigning it and now it was basically

11:56.140 --> 12:02.900
We have nothing to announce today, but tomorrow that's a whole different story.

12:02.900 --> 12:07.320
They basically announced a few days later after the whole conspiracy theory that they

12:07.320 --> 12:16.160
were going to announce a redesign because I love how they have to be right at all times.

12:16.160 --> 12:23.340
Just like I said last week, we have nothing to say at this time, but anyways they announced

12:23.340 --> 12:24.340
the DS Lite.

12:24.340 --> 12:32.620
a lot thinner, a lot smaller, and it's white. Yeah. And you'll buy it because you're a consumer

12:32.620 --> 12:39.540
whore. And hell. Actually they're talking about the original

12:39.540 --> 12:45.620
DS being marked down a couple bucks and this one's probably going to be about $120. It's

12:45.620 --> 12:52.020
supposed to be released in March for Japan, no word on the US but of course I'm sure it's

12:52.020 --> 12:58.680
gonna hit us at some point in multiple colors and all that wonderful stuff so

12:58.680 --> 13:02.960
yeah how long before Jamie buys one cuz she bought a micro or acquired one

13:02.960 --> 13:07.040
somehow so she's got to get a light to match it right are they gonna put out

13:07.040 --> 13:14.720
the light in soulless black for a dark Sakura possibly and also is a brighter

13:14.720 --> 13:19.880
screen so oh really yeah so I can use it to light the hallway in my darkened

13:19.880 --> 13:23.280
house

13:23.280 --> 13:26.680
all right so wait then this single still play advance games right not just yes

13:26.680 --> 13:27.440
but advance

13:27.440 --> 13:30.320
yeah we're not losing any that no you're not losing anything it's just a little

13:30.320 --> 13:30.920
bit there

13:30.920 --> 13:35.120
any a white stylus to match the white mmm virtual white stylus

13:35.120 --> 13:38.960
on the one things they said the possibly come with it is an actual

13:38.960 --> 13:42.720
I'm car that will go into the game by advance slot so that

13:42.720 --> 13:46.120
you know to protect it from dust and that type of stuff but

13:46.120 --> 13:49.480
yeah cares is now with the rumble packs are for

13:49.480 --> 13:53.760
actually I hate the DS Rumble pack I hate it it's it's it feels weird to me

13:53.760 --> 13:57.860
like it's it's more funny feeling than the rez trans vibrator

13:57.860 --> 14:01.720
it's it's really strange. Does it make you feel special in the uh

14:01.720 --> 14:05.460
no it makes me feel odd I don't like the DS Rumble pack it

14:05.460 --> 14:09.320
it doesn't rumble it it like it buzzes it's kinda scary

14:09.320 --> 14:12.840
yeah exactly. Like letter shock therapy. Yeah it's like Silent Hill or something

14:12.840 --> 14:15.840
so yeah it

14:15.840 --> 14:19.080
very when I heard this I was like

14:19.080 --> 14:22.200
yeah okay well I'm I'm surprised

14:22.200 --> 14:26.800
now it seems a little bit early for because did we just talk about last week

14:26.800 --> 14:30.560
when we were saying why the DS redesign won't happen we were like if it ain't

14:30.560 --> 14:33.160
broke don't fix it and the DS is doing

14:33.160 --> 14:37.480
pretty well so it's kinda surprising that but not well enough

14:37.480 --> 14:41.920
we you have to understand they've sold you know one to probably every Japanese

14:41.920 --> 14:42.400
person

14:42.400 --> 14:45.800
they have to sell another one to every Japanese person else so the only way to

14:45.800 --> 14:46.200
do that

14:46.200 --> 14:50.640
What? Redesign them. Make them smaller so you can put more on them?

14:50.640 --> 14:54.280
Then the Game Boy Pocket, then the Game Boy Pocket Color, then the

14:54.280 --> 14:58.880
Game Boy SP, then the Virtual Boy, which we all forget about, then we had the

14:58.880 --> 15:04.080
you know Game Boy DS, and then we had the Game Boy Advance, and then we had those like me

15:04.080 --> 15:04.780
who had

15:04.780 --> 15:07.880
you know lights installed in it. Also the other reason why that they have it

15:07.880 --> 15:10.040
white is to you know also set

15:10.040 --> 15:13.960
some more conspiracy theories on how Nintendo and Apple would be working

15:13.960 --> 15:16.680
together so oh yeah that's a lot of feedback I've been reading is that

15:16.680 --> 15:25.000
they're trying to make DS's look like iPods I'm not touching that one I know

15:25.000 --> 15:28.600
you've gotten there's so many things you've gotten enough hate mail in the

15:28.600 --> 15:36.960
past couple weeks I only got one letter actually but whatever yeah so is anybody

15:36.960 --> 15:42.520
in here think they'll buy one I will why because I'm a Nintendo fanboy and I buy

15:42.520 --> 15:46.920
at least one version of every system they come out with. When the SP came

15:46.920 --> 15:49.520
out I bought a blue one and when they had the red one come out I also bought

15:49.520 --> 15:53.520
the red one. That's right I forgot about that. That's sad. Yeah and when we were at

15:53.520 --> 15:57.200
the store the other day I almost bought that Mario Kart DS because of the DS

15:57.200 --> 16:02.640
bundle because it was the red DS I don't have a red DS yet so I'll buy one. Are you

16:02.640 --> 16:05.960
gonna buy a white DS and take it back when a blue one comes out? Well they said that

16:05.960 --> 16:09.720
there's gonna be a few colors for the Japanese launch I'll wait to see if

16:09.720 --> 16:12.600
there's something beyond white if there's a blue one I will get a blue one

16:12.600 --> 16:16.760
if there's a white one I guess I'll just get the white one if any other crappy

16:16.760 --> 16:20.080
colors come out like yellow or something it all depends when they come out and

16:20.080 --> 16:24.520
what the price set I mean I'm probably not gonna go trade in my DS for a new DS

16:24.520 --> 16:29.940
because I'd just be retarded but on top of that doesn't your is your Animal

16:29.940 --> 16:35.520
Crossing village dependent on your game on your system I don't know it is well

16:35.520 --> 16:38.960
friend code yeah but I don't think so yeah I'm not sure how that would screw

16:38.960 --> 16:42.220
it all up if you try to take your cart because it does say something about the

16:42.220 --> 16:49.200
cartridges linked to the system yeah who cares yes I honestly I think I'll get

16:49.200 --> 16:55.560
one but that's just for the convenience of you know it being smaller and not

16:55.560 --> 16:59.240
having enough room in my purse and I like the the extra backlighting features

16:59.240 --> 17:03.000
that's kind of cool not that the games are dark right now but they could pull

17:03.000 --> 17:06.880
another Castlevania like they did on advance and just make it impossible to

17:06.880 --> 17:14.360
see so alright well we'll see how well the DS Lite does when it comes out a

17:14.360 --> 17:18.320
little later this year we're really excited because we have a great

17:18.320 --> 17:21.840
interview tonight so we're gonna get right into that you know we've talked

17:21.840 --> 17:25.960
about something new let's talk about something a little bit retro but also a

17:25.960 --> 17:30.160
little bit new here several weeks ago on the show we reviewed a new gaming

17:30.160 --> 17:34.520
product we've been seeing and hearing a lot of in the media lately game tap game

17:34.520 --> 17:39.980
GameTap is the program you can use to download and play classic games such as Atari 2600

17:39.980 --> 17:44.640
and Sega Master System games or games of more recent memory such as games in the Tomb Raider

17:44.640 --> 17:48.060
series and Prince of Persia Sands of Time.

17:48.060 --> 17:52.080
When we reviewed the product, we had a lot of questions about the potential of this product.

17:52.080 --> 17:55.660
We decided to invite someone from GameTap onto the show to talk about the present and

17:55.660 --> 18:00.160
future of their product and we are now very happy to invite onto the program tonight,

18:00.160 --> 18:03.320
Rick Sanchez, Vice President of Content for GameTap.

18:03.320 --> 18:09.360
Are you guys ready to bring them on the line and get some of our questions answered?

18:09.360 --> 18:13.600
Joining us this week, letís say hello to Rick Sanchez, Vice President of Content with

18:13.600 --> 18:14.600
GameTap.

18:14.600 --> 18:15.600
Hi Rick, how are you doing?

18:15.600 --> 18:16.600
Rick Sanchez, Vice President of Content with GameTap

18:16.600 --> 18:17.600
Good.

18:17.600 --> 18:18.600
How are you tonight?

18:18.600 --> 18:21.780
Thank you so much for taking time out to be on our show this week.

18:21.780 --> 18:25.080
Happy to be here.

18:25.080 --> 18:26.700
Why was GameTap started?

18:26.700 --> 18:28.560
A whole bunch of reasons.

18:28.560 --> 18:32.680
I think the most important reason is that there was a guy here at Turner Broadcasting

18:32.680 --> 18:38.840
His name is Blake Lewin, who just absolutely loves video games.

18:38.840 --> 18:41.480
At the core of GameTap, while there's a lot of business reasons to go ahead and create

18:41.480 --> 18:50.080
it, is this foundation for a real passion for games, old games, new games, all games,

18:50.080 --> 18:55.840
and a belief that a good game made a year ago, five years ago, or 20 years ago, is still

18:55.840 --> 18:56.840
a good game today.

18:56.840 --> 19:00.960
It's a shame that more people can't experience a wider variety of games.

19:00.960 --> 19:05.520
It was sort of the impetus for GameTap on a personal level.

19:05.520 --> 19:11.780
For Turner, the idea of GameTap presented a really unique opportunity and an interesting

19:11.780 --> 19:16.720
foray into a broadband product, which was that there were lots of things to do with

19:16.720 --> 19:22.200
broadband out there, but to date, no one had really gone out and said, I'm going to make

19:22.200 --> 19:25.840
a product specifically for broadband, something that's designed to cater to a broadband

19:25.840 --> 19:31.720
audience that fills broadband users' needs and takes advantage of these wetter pipes

19:31.720 --> 19:33.720
in a unique and interesting way.

19:33.720 --> 19:41.680
There was a Turner impetus for GameTap, and then there was just a nice game industry coincidence

19:41.680 --> 19:47.440
that once you release a game, you've really got one shot to put it out there and that's

19:47.440 --> 19:48.440
it.

19:48.440 --> 19:52.340
If it doesn't pick up in sales in the first few weeks, it gets taken off shelves and no

19:52.340 --> 19:57.060
Nobody may ever find that game again except in a bargain bin later, unlike movies where

19:57.060 --> 20:05.020
movies hit the theaters, then they hit airplanes and hotels, then they hit DVD, then they hit

20:05.020 --> 20:07.580
pay cable, then they hit basic cable, then they hit network TV.

20:07.580 --> 20:12.220
They've got this really wonderful sort of long tail approach to all these different

20:12.220 --> 20:16.500
opportunities for people to experience the content and of course for the people who create

20:16.500 --> 20:19.580
the content to profit from their efforts.

20:19.580 --> 20:27.220
A lot of games I notice on GameTap are in some cases so old and so classic that a lot

20:27.220 --> 20:32.380
of the teenagers and even 20-somethings probably never even played these games before, so I

20:32.380 --> 20:33.380
totally can see where you're coming from.

20:33.380 --> 20:37.340
It's like a whole new life for the games.

20:37.340 --> 20:41.500
Not just the old ones, but there are two titles we have that have just really done phenomenally

20:41.500 --> 20:42.500
for us.

20:42.500 --> 20:45.100
They're both Ubisoft titles incidentally.

20:45.100 --> 20:51.100
One of them is Beyond Good and Evil, and the other is Prince of Persia, Sands of Time.

20:51.100 --> 20:55.660
They're both phenomenal games, but neither one of them really sold all that well for

20:55.660 --> 20:58.300
a variety of reasons.

20:58.300 --> 21:03.260
When Beyond Good and Evil came out, it came out during a holiday season packed with a

21:03.260 --> 21:09.940
lot of other franchise games, and it was sort of a unique, new game, sort of different.

21:09.940 --> 21:16.300
I didn't immediately find an audience, but it's consistently a game that people keep

21:16.300 --> 21:20.460
discovering and playing more and more all the time, despite the fact that it didn't

21:20.460 --> 21:21.780
really sell all that well.

21:21.780 --> 21:27.460
Standard Time is another really fantastic game, really well-reviewed when it came out,

21:27.460 --> 21:31.860
but it shipped a little late in the holiday season and came out when there was a ton of

21:31.860 --> 21:37.420
other games in the market and so I didnít find an audience for that first sort of new

21:37.420 --> 21:44.140
revamp of the original franchise, but on GameTap it was doing GameBusters.

21:44.140 --> 21:48.780
I totally agree because I never checked out Sansa Time when it first came out just because

21:48.780 --> 21:49.780
there was so much.

21:49.780 --> 21:51.860
I remember what you said, when it came out it was a very busy holiday season.

21:51.860 --> 21:55.300
I never checked it out and I finally got a chance to play it through GameTap myself a

21:55.300 --> 21:58.940
couple of weeks ago and I see where the critics really enjoyed this game.

21:58.940 --> 22:00.420
Itís a really great title.

22:00.420 --> 22:05.980
Itís really a shame I didnít do better at retail the first time around, but itís great

22:05.980 --> 22:06.980
for us.

22:06.980 --> 22:13.920
What type of extras does GameTap offer besides just these retro games themselves?

22:13.920 --> 22:18.700
What would make the average gamer, and I think this is probably the thing that makes anybody

22:18.700 --> 22:21.940
debate, ìDo I want to join the service or not?î is the money.

22:21.940 --> 22:26.220
What would make the average gamer want to pay $14.95 a month for this service?

22:26.220 --> 22:32.820
I can come up with a bunch of reasons, but if it were me and I actually work here and

22:32.820 --> 22:36.020
I was looking at how I'm going to spend my gaming dollars, there are a few things

22:36.020 --> 22:38.980
about game titles that would really drive home the value for me.

22:38.980 --> 22:44.540
One of them is just the sheer breadth of titles that we have, and we've got now over 365

22:44.540 --> 22:45.540
games in the system.

22:45.540 --> 22:50.380
We're adding between four and six a week right now, and the games cover everything

22:50.380 --> 22:55.780
from the granddaddy of video games, Pong, all the way through to pretty recent Tileslakes

22:55.780 --> 23:00.620
and Beyond Good and Evil and some of the Splinter Cell games.

23:00.620 --> 23:06.060
As a consumer, there's just no way that I can afford to buy every game I might want

23:06.060 --> 23:11.680
to play, but for a monthly fee, I can try a lot of games that maybe I was on the fence

23:11.680 --> 23:16.860
about spending money on, and I can play them as much as I want or not play them at all.

23:16.860 --> 23:22.980
So thereís no sort of lost value for me if I try a game, donít really like it and move

23:22.980 --> 23:23.980
on to something else.

23:23.980 --> 23:27.020
Itís not like I went out and spent $50 on something that I didnít like.

23:27.020 --> 23:29.860
The value of it is pretty big.

23:29.860 --> 23:32.540
That kind of relates to something I think I was reading on the website or something

23:32.540 --> 23:33.540
about.

23:33.540 --> 23:38.100
There was a good comparison to the fact that folks pay $14.95 a month for certain MMOs

23:38.100 --> 23:39.660
and thatís just for one game.

23:39.660 --> 23:40.660
Exactly.

23:40.660 --> 23:43.520
Like I said, weíre launching more all the time.

23:43.520 --> 23:47.660
But purely from that perspective, I think there's a value to us.

23:47.660 --> 23:54.560
One of the things that we do, especially with the older games we have, is we really take

23:54.560 --> 23:59.920
the time and put in the energy to make these games run the way that the original creators

23:59.920 --> 24:00.920
wanted them to run.

24:00.920 --> 24:05.900
So anybody can go out, download some emulation software, find some illegal ROMs, and play

24:05.900 --> 24:06.900
a lot of these games.

24:06.900 --> 24:12.560
But the difference between that experience and the experience in GameTap is that we went

24:12.560 --> 24:15.920
directly to the publishers that, is this game running the way it's supposed to?

24:15.920 --> 24:17.400
And they gave us feedback like,

24:17.400 --> 24:19.960
well you know that color blue is a little bit off, can you fix that?

24:19.960 --> 24:23.480
It's running just a little bit too fast, can you slow it down?

24:23.480 --> 24:24.920
There's this glitch that

24:24.920 --> 24:28.640
shouldn't be in there, can you fix that? So we're sort of remastering these games for

24:28.640 --> 24:31.680
a new generation, and when you get the game in GameTap,

24:31.680 --> 24:33.480
you're getting it the way it's supposed to be played.

24:33.480 --> 24:36.960
You're getting it the way the publishers want the game to be

24:36.960 --> 24:37.880
experienced.

24:37.880 --> 24:41.200
I didn't realize that those games were going through such intensive

24:41.200 --> 24:45.080
tweaking, so to speak, before they get rolled out on GameTap. That's excellent.

24:45.080 --> 24:48.840
Every single game that gets rolled out on GameTap,

24:48.840 --> 24:52.420
we go through a really extensive internal process where we try and get it

24:52.420 --> 24:56.160
as close to the original as possible, and then we let the publisher have their say.

24:56.160 --> 24:58.840
Every single game is approved by the original publishers.

24:58.840 --> 24:59.800
They're telling us,

24:59.800 --> 25:03.160
this game isn't running the way it's supposed to, and it's okay for your service.

25:03.160 --> 25:06.880
I think that's important. And then a lot of these games,

25:06.880 --> 25:10.880
even if you wanted to try and run them in an emulator, you may not be able to.

25:10.880 --> 25:14.660
So we have a bunch of DOS games in our service that honestly are kind of hard to get to run

25:14.660 --> 25:15.660
in any capacity.

25:15.660 --> 25:20.540
Of course, there are the Dreamcast titles that we have.

25:20.540 --> 25:22.180
We've got three up now.

25:22.180 --> 25:24.820
The Dreamcast as a platform is incredibly difficult to emulate.

25:24.820 --> 25:29.100
It's one of those tiny, complex things we've undertaken.

25:29.100 --> 25:33.500
We were going to put a lot more Dreamcast titles out this year, but where else can you

25:33.500 --> 25:35.580
jump in and play Dreamcast games?

25:35.580 --> 25:37.460
There's nowhere.

25:37.460 --> 25:42.500
I know that with the DOS games, especially old classic titles like Space Quest, especially

25:42.500 --> 25:45.900
for those folks that have tried to emulate DOS games in the past, you get problems with

25:45.900 --> 25:46.900
speed.

25:46.900 --> 25:51.340
As our computers now are so fast, you can't play those games at the optimal speed, but

25:51.340 --> 25:57.820
GameTap figured it out how to emulate that on the computer at the appropriate speed.

25:57.820 --> 26:01.460
A lot of the DOS games we're emulating almost on a game-by-game basis.

26:01.460 --> 26:05.720
We're going in, we're figuring out what do we have to do to our DOS emulator to make

26:05.720 --> 26:10.400
this game run right, and weíre doing that work, so thereís a big difference between

26:10.400 --> 26:16.800
just taking some DOS files, running it through a free DOS emulator, and the experience you

26:16.800 --> 26:18.800
get with us.

26:18.800 --> 26:25.440
I noticed that GameTap is constantly rolling out patches and features and new interface

26:25.440 --> 26:26.480
things.

26:26.480 --> 26:30.400
One thing, when I initially was reviewing GameTap on the show, I thought, ìGee, itíd

26:30.400 --> 26:35.240
be really great if one day we could have a multiplayer element in this, especially when

26:35.240 --> 26:39.800
I see the leaderboards and the competition a little bit there.

26:39.800 --> 26:44.520
Is that a possibility for the future, multiplayer or other type of interactive features with

26:44.520 --> 26:46.840
the system?

26:46.840 --> 26:50.440
The simple answer is yes.

26:50.440 --> 26:54.200
The more complex answer is I can't tell you too much about it right now, but multiplayer

26:54.200 --> 26:58.360
is something that we think is really important.

26:58.360 --> 27:02.720
Almost every game in our system has some component of multiplayer built into it, whether or not

27:02.720 --> 27:08.640
It's sitting next to somebody and you play together, or some of our PC titles which were

27:08.640 --> 27:17.240
designed to run over the internet, peer-to-peer IP playing.

27:17.240 --> 27:18.240
Multiplayer is very important to us.

27:18.240 --> 27:22.560
It's something we're working very hard on, and when we do have it, you'll find

27:22.560 --> 27:26.440
that it's something that's more than I hope what some people might have expected

27:26.440 --> 27:27.440
out of multiplayer.

27:27.440 --> 27:30.520
We can't go into any more detail than that.

27:30.520 --> 27:38.200
Weíve been talking a little bit about the games as theyíre rolled out.

27:38.200 --> 27:44.540
You release new games every week and Iíve seen articles in the press lately about GameTap

27:44.540 --> 27:46.800
getting licenses with these other game companies.

27:46.800 --> 27:52.480
How does GameTap choose the games that will actually be included in the library?

27:52.480 --> 27:57.780
Right now, weíve got a lot of games under license, more than we have in the system obviously.

27:57.780 --> 28:00.540
The way that we try to figure out which games that we have in our license are going to go

28:00.540 --> 28:06.840
into the system is a combination of taking a look at the value of any individual game

28:06.840 --> 28:09.880
and saying, when is the best time to plug this into the system?

28:09.880 --> 28:16.200
So Sands of Time, for example, we wanted to put into the system to coincide with the launch

28:16.200 --> 28:18.960
of Two Thrones, and we did a big lead-up to it.

28:18.960 --> 28:22.860
So we put in Prince of Persia 1, Prince of Persia 2, the original Jordan Meckner games.

28:22.860 --> 28:27.760
We did a big video retrospective on the entire Prince of Persia series from Prince of Persia

28:27.760 --> 28:34.120
all the way through to Thrones, and then we finally launched Sand to Time as our finale

28:34.120 --> 28:36.840
to that effort.

28:36.840 --> 28:41.880
Other things that we look at doing are essentially a technical assessment.

28:41.880 --> 28:45.560
When technically can we get this game running well enough to be able to put it into the

28:45.560 --> 28:46.560
system?

28:46.560 --> 28:49.880
Honestly, that's probably our biggest gating factor.

28:49.880 --> 28:53.920
A lot of the stuff we have under license is difficult to get running, so the Dreamcast

28:53.920 --> 28:55.400
games, for example.

28:55.400 --> 28:59.280
We have quite a few other Dreamcast games under license.

28:59.280 --> 29:03.080
We're working very hard on getting all the emulation for each one of those games running.

29:03.080 --> 29:08.720
It's basically a game-by-game process, and as soon as those are ready, we're going to

29:08.720 --> 29:09.720
put them in.

29:09.720 --> 29:12.920
It's a combination of what do we have that's available for us to use from the publishers

29:12.920 --> 29:17.880
that said, that's it, you got it right, you can use it, combined with what else is going

29:17.880 --> 29:22.640
on in the world that makes releasing this game a good time to release it.

29:22.640 --> 29:27.640
You want to make sure that you're putting it out right and not just doing something

29:27.640 --> 29:28.640
rushed.

29:28.640 --> 29:29.640
That's very important.

29:29.640 --> 29:30.640
Absolutely.

29:30.640 --> 29:33.480
The other thing we do is we try to put out big packages together.

29:33.480 --> 29:38.600
We rolled out the Heroes of Might and Magic series as a series, but we had to wait for

29:38.600 --> 29:41.800
one of the games to get finished, one of the old DOS games we had some trouble getting

29:41.800 --> 29:42.800
running.

29:42.800 --> 29:46.180
We held all the other Heroes of Might and Magic games so we could get that one final

29:46.180 --> 29:47.180
game fixed.

29:47.180 --> 29:51.400
Then we released the whole thing as a big giant stunt where you could play the entire

29:51.400 --> 29:52.400
Heroes of Might and Magic series.

29:52.400 --> 29:53.400
Thatís another way that we pick games.

29:53.400 --> 29:54.400
Douglas Goldstein, CFPÆ, Financial Planner & Investment Advisor

29:54.400 --> 30:00.700
Iíve noticed that too with Space Quest, which is a series Iíve been following, it seemed

30:00.700 --> 30:05.700
like for a few weeks there it was kind of like your Space Quest 5 and 3, like a new

30:05.700 --> 30:11.180
game from that series was showing up every couple of weeks, which was kind of cool.

30:11.180 --> 30:16.660
I know you talked about a big push going on with Prince of Persia, Sands of Time.

30:16.660 --> 30:20.180
Are there other types of big titles that GameTap is going to be adding in the future?

30:20.180 --> 30:29.460
Any hints that you can give us here on what's coming up?

30:29.460 --> 30:37.820
It's probably nothing as big as Sands of Time in the next couple of weeks.

30:37.820 --> 30:45.500
We do have the series Lords of the Realm coming very soon, which is a very favorite classic

30:45.500 --> 30:48.540
series that a lot of people have enjoyed.

30:48.540 --> 30:54.420
We have another iteration of the Commandos series from Eidos coming soon.

30:54.420 --> 31:00.900
I donít know if I would want to reveal anything more than what Iíve just given you right

31:00.900 --> 31:01.900
now.

31:01.900 --> 31:02.900
Okay, thatís fine.

31:02.900 --> 31:03.900
Weíve got to keep some secrets.

31:03.900 --> 31:04.900
Thatís fine.

31:04.900 --> 31:05.900
Iíve got to keep a few things in my back pocket.

31:05.900 --> 31:08.100
I already gave you the multiplayer hint.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.100
All right.

31:09.100 --> 31:11.380
Weíll take it.

31:11.380 --> 31:15.920
One thing, going to a completely different topic, because I know that GameTap is a little

31:15.920 --> 31:21.080
more than just the games, because when we originally reviewed GameTap on this program,

31:21.080 --> 31:23.060
we noticed the MediaPlex right away.

31:23.060 --> 31:29.540
We noticed this section of the software and there are basically television program shorts

31:29.540 --> 31:32.900
that are kind of loaded in here that the subscribers can watch.

31:32.900 --> 31:38.880
How are these segments chosen for broadcast?

31:38.880 --> 31:44.100
The theory behind our Mediaplax is really that GameTap as a whole is a combination of

31:44.100 --> 31:46.300
games on demand and video on demand.

31:46.300 --> 31:51.300
We're calling it a broadband network, you can play kind of thing, but it's sort of

31:51.300 --> 31:55.420
a new creature that lives online that takes things from the internet and takes things

31:55.420 --> 32:01.100
from broadcast from a lot of different entertainment disciplines and puts them together into a

32:01.100 --> 32:02.100
broadband package.

32:02.100 --> 32:07.380
The media plexus is our linear video programming side of the equation.

32:07.380 --> 32:12.660
In there, we're trying to create sort of a TV network for the internet.

32:12.660 --> 32:14.460
TV networks are very linear.

32:14.460 --> 32:18.780
You don't have a lot of control over them unless you own a TV or a replay TV or some

32:18.780 --> 32:22.020
kind of other digital recording device.

32:22.020 --> 32:25.560
With our television offering, what we've got now and what I can tell you we're moving

32:25.560 --> 32:29.340
more towards is true video on demand, where all of our programming is put in a place where

32:29.340 --> 32:32.140
you can decide what you want to watch, when you want to watch it, and how you want to

32:32.140 --> 32:33.260
watch it.

32:33.260 --> 32:39.700
We create series based primarily on what we think our audience is interested in.

32:39.700 --> 32:41.420
We have a series called Tapped In.

32:41.420 --> 32:46.680
It's a behind-the-scenes, did-you-know, magazine-style show, so one of my favorite

32:46.680 --> 32:49.240
episode is about the Rayman franchise.

32:49.240 --> 32:52.200
What most people don't know about Rayman is that it was originally created by a teenager

32:52.200 --> 32:53.200
in France.

32:53.200 --> 32:58.600
The reason he has no arms and legs is because when they were animating him, the arms and

32:58.600 --> 33:03.000
legs just made the animation too choppy on the hardware at the time.

33:03.000 --> 33:06.680
To keep the animation as fluid as possible, they just erased the arms and legs and created

33:06.680 --> 33:11.200
this very iconic character who is still showing up in video games today.

33:11.200 --> 33:20.200
So we've got a program like that that is designed to provide sort of an informative look at games with a nice entertainment spin.

33:20.200 --> 33:26.200
And then we have Space Ghost, which is my favorite interviewer of all time.

33:26.200 --> 33:29.200
As with a lot of people, I feel very similar.

33:29.200 --> 33:37.200
And with that, we want to bring an interesting interview format to the game space that's never existed before.

33:37.200 --> 33:38.200
before.

33:38.200 --> 33:39.200
Everybody does interviews, right?

33:39.200 --> 33:45.360
G4 does interviews, IGN does interviews, Electronic Gaming News does interviews, everybody's

33:45.360 --> 33:50.800
got interviews, but nobody has interviews quite the way Space Ghost does them.

33:50.800 --> 33:55.540
From one interviewer to that one, I have to concede, no interviewer can do it like Space

33:55.540 --> 33:56.540
Ghost.

33:56.540 --> 33:57.540
Exactly.

33:57.540 --> 34:02.020
So that's our take there, that we wanted to bring a different perspective to interviewing

34:02.020 --> 34:07.160
to the game industry, and that's why Space Ghost made the leap from broadcast to broadband.

34:07.160 --> 34:15.060
In other programming, we picked to highlight some of the games in our system, and in other

34:15.060 --> 34:19.700
programming, it's really designed to fulfill the entertainment needs of people who are

34:19.700 --> 34:23.540
interested in games.

34:23.540 --> 34:28.820
Our goal with MediaPlex is to provide really interesting content that, if you like games,

34:28.820 --> 34:34.420
you might also enjoy, to give it its gaming lifestyle television.

34:34.420 --> 34:38.740
I have to go here because I went here when I initially reviewed GameTap on this program

34:38.740 --> 34:42.780
and you brought up something that was very interesting in the last segment as you said

34:42.780 --> 34:46.860
nobody can do interviews and you mentioned some other television stations right there.

34:46.860 --> 34:52.940
Now I noticed that GameTap is owned by Turner Broadcasting who owns various over cable television

34:52.940 --> 34:54.060
networks.

34:54.060 --> 35:02.580
Some gamers feel very underrepresented right now by what's on gaming television so to

35:02.580 --> 35:03.620
speak.

35:03.620 --> 35:09.620
Is there a possibility of crossing over onto Turner's other properties, like the GameTap

35:09.620 --> 35:14.660
show on TBS, so folks over cable can feel represented again?

35:14.660 --> 35:19.340
David Tompkins You can always say there's a possibility.

35:19.340 --> 35:21.140
I don't have anything like that planned right now.

35:21.140 --> 35:23.740
Our focus is really on broadband.

35:23.740 --> 35:30.540
We really believe that gamers as a group, people who may not consider themselves gamers

35:30.540 --> 35:35.580
but enjoy games, they're moving increasingly to broadband as a platform, they're moving

35:35.580 --> 35:42.420
away from television, they're digesting information in a more sort of piece by piece

35:42.420 --> 35:43.420
kind of way.

35:43.420 --> 35:48.340
So instead of sitting back and watching a half hour of programming about games, they're

35:48.340 --> 35:51.420
more interested in, I want to see this and I want to see that, but I don't want to

35:51.420 --> 35:53.060
see the rest.

35:53.060 --> 36:00.140
So from our perspective, it's a much more compelling content offering and also a much

36:00.140 --> 36:05.740
much more compelling way to represent our audience to deliver our message and our content

36:05.740 --> 36:09.000
through the broadband medium rather than television.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.780
One thing Iíve got to say I like about the way itís set up to the standard over cable

36:12.780 --> 36:16.480
networks wouldnít be able to provide is that when GameTap is featuring a game in one of

36:16.480 --> 36:20.500
the programs, I could click a couple of buttons and then be playing that game.

36:20.500 --> 36:24.860
Exactly, and youíll see a lot more of that over the next few months.

36:24.860 --> 36:30.420
Now kind of going to a different topic here, with GameTap kind of tapping into these retro

36:30.420 --> 36:34.700
games as well as some of the newer titles as well and this whole push towards like a

36:34.700 --> 36:41.380
broadband center basically, is it possible one day that GameTap could maybe leave the

36:41.380 --> 36:44.600
computer and become something that you plug right into the TV?

36:44.600 --> 36:48.100
Because I think about retro gaming is very popular with those little joysticks you can

36:48.100 --> 36:49.100
plug into the TV.

36:49.100 --> 36:52.580
Could GameTap be a console one day that you plug right into television?

36:52.580 --> 37:02.060
We wouldn't rule it out, but our focus right now is really PC formats, so something with

37:02.060 --> 37:04.300
a computer chip in it that has to hook up to a screen.

37:04.300 --> 37:06.540
That's really what we're looking at right now.

37:06.540 --> 37:09.820
Having said that, we had a big announcement at CES recently.

37:09.820 --> 37:17.460
We're participating in Intel's VIVE platform, so a decent VIVE system hooked up to a TV

37:17.460 --> 37:20.500
and you've got GameTap as a platform running on your big screen.

37:20.500 --> 37:25.780
It's not so far-fetched, but I don't know that we would want to necessarily work within

37:25.780 --> 37:30.120
the confines of one of those joysticks you plug into a TV, for a variety of reasons,

37:30.120 --> 37:34.660
one of them being if you added up the total volume, disk space volume, of all the games

37:34.660 --> 37:40.980
we have in our library, you'd have to have a lot of hard drives to plug into your TV

37:40.980 --> 37:47.500
to get the GameTap experience, and then divorcing the video from GameTap, which you'd have

37:47.500 --> 37:58.060
to do in one of those things, but it would make game type a lot less than it is today.

37:58.060 --> 38:04.460
My last question I have for you today is subscription and download-based gaming the future of gaming

38:04.460 --> 38:09.540
as you see it, or is it just another thing that can complement the consoles, the CDs

38:09.540 --> 38:11.900
that we have now?

38:11.900 --> 38:16.500
I don't think digital delivery is going to replace physical delivery.

38:16.500 --> 38:21.640
I think it's going to be a great complement to physical delivery for a lot of reasons.

38:21.640 --> 38:26.940
One of them is if you take a look at the latest generation of consoles coming out and the

38:26.940 --> 38:31.720
sheer quantity of data that has to fit on one of those disks for those games, physical

38:31.720 --> 38:37.240
storage is still outpacing the ability of broadband pipes to deliver that much data

38:37.240 --> 38:38.740
that quickly.

38:38.740 --> 38:43.760
Our biggest games on GameTap still take 15, sometimes 20 minutes to download, and if you

38:43.760 --> 38:49.720
a slow connection, and I use slow as a relative term, like a DSL connection, it might take

38:49.720 --> 38:56.040
even longer, versus a CD, you pop it in, and you're ready to go.

38:56.040 --> 39:03.320
One of the things we do to make downloading less of a task is, on GameTap, you can play

39:03.320 --> 39:06.360
a smaller game like Pac-Man while you're downloading Splinter Cell.

39:06.360 --> 39:10.360
If you don't have to wait to play games with us while you're downloading something,

39:10.360 --> 39:12.640
there's plenty of other small games you can play while you're waiting.

39:12.640 --> 39:19.020
You could do like three games at once.

39:19.020 --> 39:35.600
Rick Sanchez is Vice past president of content game tab.

39:35.600 --> 39:37.280
Thank you so much for being on the show this week.

39:37.280 --> 39:38.500
We really appreciate it.

39:38.500 --> 39:46.980
We've got some very good Space Ghost coming up.

39:46.980 --> 39:48.980
If you haven't already tuned in, you should.

39:48.980 --> 39:53.860
We recently did a Space Ghost with Al Corn, the guy who created Pong.

39:53.860 --> 39:56.860
Very funny if you're a fan of the series.

39:56.860 --> 40:01.420
www.gametap.com if you want to check it out. Thanks again, Rick, for being here.

40:01.420 --> 40:02.460
Really appreciate it.

40:02.460 --> 40:06.000
And I hope to have you on the show again sometime.

40:06.000 --> 40:09.740
Especially when you get that multiplayer. Wink, wink.

40:09.740 --> 40:12.580
Alright.

40:12.580 --> 40:16.220
Alright. That was pretty informative. I like that.

40:16.220 --> 40:19.940
Very cool. Multiplayer. Sounds exciting.

40:19.940 --> 40:23.500
Alright. Well, thank you very much again, Rick, for being here on the program this

40:23.500 --> 40:26.460
week. We really appreciate it and looking forward to those

40:26.460 --> 40:29.940
new things coming on GameTap in the future. Alright,

40:29.940 --> 40:34.420
let's move on and talk about something going on with the traditional console

40:34.420 --> 40:35.500
style game.

40:35.500 --> 40:39.140
Now, you notice in that interview Rick talked a lot about, you know, they try to

40:39.140 --> 40:42.380
make the games perfect and authentic and like the originals.

40:42.380 --> 40:45.540
Well, sometimes the original games are flawed a little bit, aren't they?

40:45.540 --> 40:49.180
Yes, such is the case with Animal Crossing, right, Jamie? Well, there's

40:49.180 --> 40:52.580
actually a teensy little bitty hack that's going out.

40:52.580 --> 40:56.180
Well, it's not really determined if it's a hack or just a glitch.

40:56.180 --> 41:01.400
But basically you'll receive a letter that says YYGH with a return signal or something

41:01.400 --> 41:05.100
to that effect that has a red tulip in it.

41:05.100 --> 41:10.620
Now this red tulip is special because you can plant it anywhere.

41:10.620 --> 41:14.940
And I don't just mean, you know, anywhere you can plant it on pavement, pull it up and

41:14.940 --> 41:16.900
then plant a tree there.

41:16.900 --> 41:19.740
Or you can also plant it in your house.

41:19.740 --> 41:24.820
However, planting it in your house is kind of crappy because once you plant it, the space

41:24.820 --> 41:28.940
goes invisible you cannot put anything there you cannot move it you can't do

41:28.940 --> 41:35.260
anything basically the block of space that takes up is a dead space so

41:35.260 --> 41:42.900
Nintendo has put out something to say about this basically saying that you

41:42.900 --> 41:46.980
know basically just what I said you'll lose that space on your floor it tells

41:46.980 --> 41:49.420
you you know what it does it says basically you don't want to drop the

41:49.420 --> 41:54.060
item in your house or outside your house and if you happen to make sure you do

41:54.060 --> 41:58.940
Do not save your game, reset and face the wrath of Mr. Resetty.

41:58.940 --> 42:00.540
And face the wrath of Mr. Resetty?

42:00.540 --> 42:01.540
I don't know what's worse.

42:01.540 --> 42:03.340
You can do that for 15 minutes.

42:03.340 --> 42:07.300
Well, what it actually ended up being is there was going to be another one of those letters,

42:07.300 --> 42:09.300
remember how they had the coin that came out a while back.

42:09.300 --> 42:10.300
Right, that's what I figured.

42:10.300 --> 42:15.420
It went out unfinished and so when it got sent out, because the letter was from Nintendo

42:15.420 --> 42:20.180
itself and so now this is going out and everyone's like, oh crap.

42:20.180 --> 42:21.180
Someone just got fired.

42:21.180 --> 42:26.060
so I want a special read to about you actually haven't checked my game today

42:26.060 --> 42:28.940
I probably should the special read to let me have

42:28.940 --> 42:32.820
I did not have mine I checked and I went on Wi-Fi and nothing

42:32.820 --> 42:36.180
so it must have been on there for only a very short period of time and

42:36.180 --> 42:39.660
it actually you know to go and say it was actually confirmed via

42:39.660 --> 42:43.460
conversation by calling nintendo's a helpline also

42:43.460 --> 42:47.760
there's another bit of issue going out with Animal Crossing wild world

42:47.760 --> 42:55.160
They're saying there are people who have basically revealed that their games have fallen prey

42:55.160 --> 43:00.360
to hackers who managed to remove the gates of the villages they visit.

43:00.360 --> 43:03.920
Gamers are trapped offline if they've saved after the hack has taken place.

43:03.920 --> 43:05.480
Yeah, I heard about this.

43:05.480 --> 43:10.040
Something like it jinxes your gate into a museum or something.

43:10.040 --> 43:14.000
I don't know, it'll totally make your gate disappear and turn it into something else

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
so it's gone.

43:15.000 --> 43:22.120
But it's, you know, it's really a crappy thing to happen, you know, to have your game just

43:22.120 --> 43:27.840
messed with like that, I mean, I don't see, it just goes to show that, you know, there's

43:27.840 --> 43:33.580
people who try to, you know, pull crap because they can and without any regard to anybody

43:33.580 --> 43:34.580
but themselves.

43:34.580 --> 43:36.600
Be careful who you give your friend codes out to.

43:36.600 --> 43:37.600
Exactly.

43:37.600 --> 43:41.280
And if we see somebody on the Orange Lounge friend code thread doing this stuff, we will

43:41.280 --> 43:43.460
Publicly embarrass you.

43:43.460 --> 43:46.760
We will send you many red tulips of death, and then some.

43:46.760 --> 43:48.080
And publicly embarrass you.

43:48.080 --> 43:49.080
That's right.

43:49.080 --> 43:51.240
Not in a good way.

43:51.240 --> 43:53.380
Gamers all over the world will know your name.

43:53.380 --> 43:55.080
We're talking Wedgie from the flagpole.

43:55.080 --> 43:56.080
Oh yeah.

43:56.080 --> 43:58.360
All right.

43:58.360 --> 43:59.480
With barbed wire.

43:59.480 --> 44:01.400
Thank you for that lovely warning.

44:01.400 --> 44:02.400
Appreciate it.

44:02.400 --> 44:06.640
Since, you know, since we're such animal crossing whores on this show apparently, I swear, have

44:06.640 --> 44:10.040
we gone one week since the game came out and not talked about it?

44:10.040 --> 44:11.040
In one way or another?

44:11.040 --> 44:12.040
No.

44:12.040 --> 44:13.040
Sad.

44:13.040 --> 44:18.040
Anyway, speaking of the wrath, Rockstar's feeling the wrath once again.

44:18.040 --> 44:19.420
Who from this time, Loki?

44:19.420 --> 44:25.860
This time from the city of L.A., and that's really retarded, but anyway, some L.A. attorney

44:25.860 --> 44:29.760
Rocky Dela...

44:29.760 --> 44:34.480
Some guy named Rocky, okay, with a really hard to pronounce last name.

44:34.480 --> 44:39.160
Not that it really matters because this case is just going to get kicked out anyways, but

44:39.160 --> 44:45.280
He believes that Rockstar is responsible for this, you know, the hot coffee crap that went

44:45.280 --> 44:51.360
on and basically says businesses have the obligation to truthfully disclose the content

44:51.360 --> 44:57.680
of their products whether in the food we eat or in the entertainment we consume.

44:57.680 --> 45:04.240
So basically, you know, he's saying, oh, the poor children have been hurt by the game.

45:04.240 --> 45:07.080
He fails to realize a couple of points here.

45:07.080 --> 45:13.300
First off, the rating system they have on games is in no way set in stone, or even for

45:13.300 --> 45:19.320
the fact that when this whole hot coffee thing took place, it wasn't really actually, you

45:19.320 --> 45:22.400
couldn't get punished for selling this game to a minor.

45:22.400 --> 45:24.460
It was basically in store policy.

45:24.460 --> 45:26.400
There's no penalties whatsoever.

45:26.400 --> 45:30.160
The other thing is, assuming the fact that these parents shouldn't have been buying the

45:30.160 --> 45:35.320
games for their kids because the ratings are 17 and over, hello, I mean I think they should

45:35.320 --> 45:40.800
be able to understand, oh now there's a little bit of sex in here, oh crap, you know.

45:40.800 --> 45:48.040
The other thing also, he's looking for penalties against Take-Two and Rockstar and his request

45:48.040 --> 45:53.400
that the companies fully disclose the content of their games, probably also seeking some

45:53.400 --> 45:55.440
money as well.

45:55.440 --> 45:58.000
You know what else might be fueling this lawsuit?

45:58.000 --> 46:00.880
GamePolitics.com had a very interesting speculation on this.

46:00.880 --> 46:04.440
They ran a story on this earlier this week.

46:04.440 --> 46:10.220
Rocky I'm gonna I'll try the last name okay Loki it's Rocky delgadillo how's

46:10.220 --> 46:15.180
that that's all right sounds like a deal he's actually running for California

46:15.180 --> 46:20.260
Attorney General this year and will be in the June 6th primary hmm so he's

46:20.260 --> 46:26.260
playing a Clinton hmm you know what I hope every I hope that everyone that

46:26.260 --> 46:30.540
runs on the platform of you know video game violence hurting our children fails

46:30.540 --> 46:37.700
and burns in hell that's what I hope right there all right well that's that's

46:37.700 --> 46:43.260
one of those draw your own conclusions and opinions on that political stuff I

46:43.260 --> 46:48.020
don't know you know yeah I feel I don't I just think politicians in general are

46:48.020 --> 46:51.940
misinformed on this whole thing that's kind of my oh really you think that he

46:51.940 --> 46:55.660
doesn't have any idea what's going on at all I'm saying you don't have to be

46:55.660 --> 46:59.740
Democrat Republican libertarian Green Party I don't care who you are I think

46:59.740 --> 47:03.380
I think politicians in general are misinformed on this whole thing.

47:03.380 --> 47:09.180
Or, it may not necessarily be that they are misinformed, but they are spreading the misinformation.

47:09.180 --> 47:11.300
Ah, that's a big part of it too.

47:11.300 --> 47:14.860
Why are politicians jumping on the fact that Weebl's movies suck?

47:14.860 --> 47:19.900
Now granted they advertise them as good movies and they are hiding the fact that the content

47:19.900 --> 47:26.580
of the movie sucks ass and I could possibly waste my time and money on this crap.

47:26.580 --> 47:28.180
Why aren't they going after them?

47:28.180 --> 47:29.180
That's what I want to know.

47:29.180 --> 47:33.540
There was no mention in BloodRayne at all in the beginning of the entire previews, there

47:33.540 --> 47:37.360
was no mention that there was going to be boobies in there, and my god, there were boobies

47:37.360 --> 47:38.360
in there!

47:38.360 --> 47:39.740
I was totally caught off guard!

47:39.740 --> 47:44.660
Well what about the MPAA thing that says rated R for sexuality and all that stuff?

47:44.660 --> 47:47.020
Oh, sexual- what the hell does sexuality mean?

47:47.020 --> 47:50.660
I mean, because that was on Grand Theft Auto, I didn't know they were talking about boobies!

47:50.660 --> 47:52.860
Rated R because she might be a lesbian.

47:52.860 --> 47:53.860
We just don't know.

47:53.860 --> 47:57.500
And violence and stuff, but oh my god, there was boobies in there!

47:57.500 --> 47:58.840
And this is the thing.

47:58.840 --> 48:01.120
Why aren't they going after crappy entertainment?

48:01.120 --> 48:04.900
Because that is more of a threat to society than these games.

48:04.900 --> 48:10.240
To go see Blood Rain or something like that, I don't have to put a special code in for

48:10.240 --> 48:12.560
the crap to pop up on the screen.

48:12.560 --> 48:13.580
It's already there.

48:13.580 --> 48:15.020
It's written in the script.

48:15.020 --> 48:21.580
So what we need to do is we need to go after these people and stop trying to blame everybody

48:21.580 --> 48:22.580
for everything.

48:22.580 --> 48:26.780
Like there was another story earlier this week saying, oh this car crash is caused by

48:26.780 --> 48:31.540
need for speed most wanted because the game has cars in it therefore the game

48:31.540 --> 48:37.580
caused the crash is retarded all right you can send those cards and letters to

48:37.580 --> 48:41.860
Loki care of mailbag at orange lounge radio.com I know we'll be getting lots of

48:41.860 --> 48:45.420
those your rants are so entertaining I just sit back here and laugh and laugh

48:45.420 --> 48:51.780
okay well you know one thing sometimes the folks that get blamed in these

48:51.780 --> 48:58.980
situations of the parents but are every parents these anti or I shouldn't I

48:58.980 --> 49:02.700
shouldn't say anti is every parent a completely misinformed when it comes to

49:02.700 --> 49:08.820
video games you know I'm going to be a parent one day and you know what I'm

49:08.820 --> 49:12.380
going to do I'm going to play video games with my children and I'm going to

49:12.380 --> 49:17.380
encourage them to play games and actually that's not an uncommon point of

49:17.380 --> 49:31.380
There is a study that's out by the Peter D. Hart Research Associates that was released by the ESA that shows that 35% of U.S. parents play games with their children.

49:31.380 --> 49:39.380
80% of the study group actually plays with their children and 47% of them are women. Go gamers!

49:39.380 --> 49:44.380
Interesting for those folks who say, you know, girls don't play games. 47% of mommies.

49:44.380 --> 49:55.420
It's 35% of U.S. parents play, 47% of them are women, and 80% of gaming parents say they

49:55.420 --> 49:58.420
play with their children.

49:58.420 --> 50:03.580
Did you also know 65% of statistics are made up on the spot?

50:03.580 --> 50:06.580
Wow!

50:06.580 --> 50:10.980
But the other interesting thing about this is that they also show with this study that

50:10.980 --> 50:16.180
85% of voting parents, including those who do not play video games, say that parents

50:16.180 --> 50:19.660
should take responsibility for their children's exposure to the games.

50:19.660 --> 50:25.740
The ESA president stated, I'm just going to quote, this research suggests that proposals

50:25.740 --> 50:30.700
to regulate video games may backfire with American voters who, unlike some elected officials,

50:30.700 --> 50:34.100
appear to fully understand that they should control the entertainment that comes into

50:34.100 --> 50:35.100
their homes.

50:35.100 --> 50:36.100
Hallelujah!

50:36.100 --> 50:37.980
You're listening to that?

50:37.980 --> 50:39.980
You listen to that, Rocky?

50:39.980 --> 50:43.340
but there's also some more interesting statistics

50:43.340 --> 50:46.900
average age of gaming parent 37 in a row

50:46.900 --> 50:52.500
average length of gaming parent has been gaming is 13 years

50:52.500 --> 50:55.820
percentage of gaming parents who introduced their children to video games

50:55.820 --> 50:57.160
36 percent

50:57.160 --> 51:00.540
percentage of gaming parents who were introduced to gaming by their children

51:00.540 --> 51:03.940
27 percent. Huh. Interesting.

51:03.940 --> 51:07.060
So, you know, it just points out, you know, we're

51:07.060 --> 51:10.620
This whole crap we're seeing about games

51:10.620 --> 51:13.740
I honestly have a feeling that we're probably gonna see

51:13.740 --> 51:18.480
a dying off because we, our generation, we are the ones who grew up with the video

51:18.480 --> 51:19.220
games, aren't we?

51:19.220 --> 51:23.100
I agree. Not everybody, but you know, a lot.

51:23.100 --> 51:27.500
But most of us. We remember when these were all new and shiny and nothing like this

51:27.500 --> 51:28.720
had ever been seen before.

51:28.720 --> 51:33.800
You know, it's one thing to say the video game boom started

51:33.800 --> 51:37.200
in my lifetime, you know, and

51:37.200 --> 51:41.120
more and more of us are going to be raised gamers. And when they say parents play

51:41.120 --> 51:42.920
video games with their kids, they don't mean like

51:42.920 --> 51:46.000
Grand Theft Auto is what they're playing with their kids. There's plenty of

51:46.000 --> 51:49.960
family-friendly games out there that parents can play with their kids

51:49.960 --> 51:53.520
like the guy game. Like a

51:53.520 --> 51:57.880
you know, like Katamari Damacy, that's good clean rolling over people fun. Tetris

51:57.880 --> 52:02.020
and the Spongebob, the endless barrage of Spongebob games they put out on the

52:02.020 --> 52:09.740
various console Mary Kate and Ashley Shop-a-thon the winks all right ha ha

52:09.740 --> 52:15.300
ha sorry anyway ah very interesting all right

52:15.300 --> 52:18.400
thank you Jamie well let's go back to Jamie because Jamie also wants to tell

52:18.400 --> 52:21.940
us about a conference I don't want to tell you anything so I'm just gonna sit

52:21.940 --> 52:26.260
here and look pretty look it's the radio so you can't get away with that damn it

52:26.260 --> 52:38.260
Okay, well, how about the Game Writers Conference that actually took place in Austin last October?

52:38.260 --> 52:43.260
Will they be actually teaching people how to write for games? Because some of them need some bad help.

52:43.260 --> 52:45.260
Some of them are doing okay, but some of them need some help.

52:45.260 --> 52:53.260
It actually does specifically state here that games were not so much written as put together by the programmers and the artists involved,

52:53.260 --> 52:55.260
But a lot more

52:55.440 --> 53:01.680
Publishers are actually looking to have writing behind the games good solid writing just like you would for a movie, you know

53:01.680 --> 53:07.760
Or it or like a television production. You can't have a story without someone to write it, right?

53:08.720 --> 53:10.560
true true

53:10.560 --> 53:12.560
so, uh

53:12.640 --> 53:16.800
You know, there's also involvement then with this from the Writers Guild of America

53:16.800 --> 53:22.800
that started its new media caucus to bring new writers in.

53:22.800 --> 53:24.800
Let's see, I've got a name on here.

53:24.800 --> 53:28.800
There's the author of three James Bond screenplays that's involved in this.

53:28.800 --> 53:34.800
And he also wrote two of the 007 video games involved in their little project.

53:34.800 --> 53:40.800
There's actually a pretty good quote in here from the guild president.

53:40.800 --> 53:42.800
Patrick Veron is his name.

53:42.800 --> 53:48.040
name. Game players are becoming more sophisticated in terms of their expectations. At the same

53:48.040 --> 53:52.280
time, the publishers are making licensing deals, many of which require quality storytelling

53:52.280 --> 53:56.400
to be built into the games. As you know, storytelling and character development don't just fall

53:56.400 --> 54:00.600
out of the sky. They actually have to be written by creative talent.

54:00.600 --> 54:04.120
What do you think would be the difference between game writing and movie writing?

54:04.120 --> 54:09.500
Not too much, really. Think about this. A lot more games, especially the more cinematic

54:09.500 --> 54:13.100
the game have full storyboards made for them I mean

54:13.100 --> 54:17.420
scripted there you have to have dialogue scripted for any

54:17.420 --> 54:21.140
you know it was one thing back when we were all pixel games you could say sorry

54:21.140 --> 54:23.300
Mario our princess is in another castle

54:23.300 --> 54:26.380
but it's another thing now to have full-blown

54:26.380 --> 54:31.000
conversations between characters full on dialogue you have to have someone sit back

54:31.000 --> 54:31.660
and write

54:31.660 --> 54:34.940
exactly how everything's going to pan out especially

54:34.940 --> 54:39.340
say you have a game where you've got multi directions you have to be able to

54:39.340 --> 54:41.060
write on multiple paths

54:41.060 --> 54:44.340
you know you can't just say oh here's a game

54:44.340 --> 54:48.940
you have to know where you're gonna go there as much of a story as reading a

54:48.940 --> 54:49.340
book

54:49.340 --> 54:54.620
I think that I have decided that that's what I want to do when I grow up

54:54.620 --> 54:59.180
really? Write for games? Well you know I'm actually in school to do a

54:59.180 --> 55:03.440
because part of what I want to do is manuals. So will you write a game and then we can

55:03.440 --> 55:04.780
give it a negative review on the show?

55:04.780 --> 55:07.820
No. Anything that I do is instantly fabulous.

55:07.820 --> 55:11.920
Alright, I'm reading some feedback from the chat room. The chat room is actually still responding to the last story

55:11.920 --> 55:13.140
about the parents in the video games.

55:13.140 --> 55:16.500
Toasty says, his mom played Shenmue.

55:16.500 --> 55:21.340
Remember that one on the Dreamcast? We played the heck out of Shenmue.

55:21.340 --> 55:24.380
Yeah. Let's see, what else is there? Pooface.

55:24.380 --> 55:28.300
Love that nickname. Pooface says, my parents love Guitar Hero.

55:28.300 --> 55:32.340
That's pretty cool. Do they know that you have poo on your face?

55:32.340 --> 55:34.040
That's what I'd be concerned about with your parents.

55:34.040 --> 55:35.640
Or is that just a descriptive name?

55:35.640 --> 55:41.060
And then I think there's a consensus there in the chat room between Deekman and Pope

55:41.060 --> 55:43.420
Panda 21 that Spongebob sucks.

55:43.420 --> 55:46.960
I like Spongebob personally, but not the games.

55:46.960 --> 55:47.960
Not the games.

55:47.960 --> 55:48.960
Cartoon for me.

55:48.960 --> 55:49.960
Not the games.

55:49.960 --> 55:50.960
You know what?

55:50.960 --> 55:51.960
What?

55:51.960 --> 55:52.960
Nothing.

55:52.960 --> 55:54.860
And then they're getting into this whole argument about Democrats versus Republicans

55:54.860 --> 55:59.580
now in the chat room, although I think, didn't we just say a lot of this crap ends up being

55:59.580 --> 56:00.660
bipartisan anyway?

56:00.660 --> 56:04.360
In order to pass, usually it has to have bipartisan support, so whatever.

56:04.360 --> 56:07.680
I don't want to get in those arguments right now.

56:07.680 --> 56:10.240
This misinformation campaigns need to be stopped in general.

56:10.240 --> 56:11.960
I don't care who's put them on the table.

56:11.960 --> 56:17.080
Anyway, of course, then again, it's not like we've never gotten a story wrong here on this

56:17.080 --> 56:19.260
show and had to correct it next week.

56:19.260 --> 56:21.160
We never get anything wrong.

56:21.160 --> 56:22.160
We're fabulous.

56:22.160 --> 56:23.160
We're Orange Lawn Radio.

56:23.160 --> 56:24.160
We try our best.

56:24.160 --> 56:26.160
We issue corrections when we're wrong.

56:26.160 --> 56:27.160
All right.

56:27.160 --> 56:29.300
Anyway, moving on.

56:29.300 --> 56:31.300
Let's keep it political for a minute.

56:31.300 --> 56:32.300
Loki.

56:32.300 --> 56:34.580
Oh, these guys are always controversial in Texas.

56:34.580 --> 56:35.980
What's going on in Texas?

56:35.980 --> 56:39.460
Other than a lot of electrocutions?

56:39.460 --> 56:40.460
Not much.

56:40.460 --> 56:44.660
Anyways, we've got yet another politician running on a stupid platform that has to do

56:44.660 --> 56:49.100
with video games and this one's just completely retarded.

56:49.100 --> 56:54.920
First off, you can visit this guy, Starlock, which is also a really dumb name.

56:54.920 --> 56:58.420
His website, which I'm going to read the motto off the top of the page.

56:58.420 --> 57:00.460
As for me and my house, we serve the Lord.

57:00.460 --> 57:05.380
To give you an idea of what his views are on violent video games and anything else that

57:05.380 --> 57:07.060
might be bad for you.

57:07.060 --> 57:12.540
To start off, his platform is he wants to propose a $10,000 per abortion tax for medical

57:12.540 --> 57:13.540
clinics.

57:13.540 --> 57:17.500
He also wants to eliminate property taxes, of course financing all the other tax revenue

57:17.500 --> 57:18.900
via these.

57:18.900 --> 57:24.580
But the main one, of course, is a 100% tax on any violent video game.

57:24.580 --> 57:25.580
100% tax.

57:25.580 --> 57:29.740
100% tax, so you'd have to pay twice what you're paying on it right now.

57:29.740 --> 57:35.940
So in other words, for Grand Theft Auto, when it was new, I'd be paying like $100 for it.

57:35.940 --> 57:41.980
The other thing, he wants to put out a 50% tax on all sodas that contain glucose and

57:41.980 --> 57:50.600
fructose and sucrose, and also a 50% grease tax on all food prepared by deep frying or

57:50.600 --> 57:53.100
cooking in any form of oil or grease.

57:53.100 --> 57:57.780
There will also be a 75% tax on fun.

57:57.780 --> 58:01.420
This is another guy who probably won't...

58:01.420 --> 58:07.340
I mean, granted, even if you don't agree with the whole video game 100% tax or whatever,

58:07.340 --> 58:10.300
or even if you do agree with that, you're probably not going to agree with half the

58:10.300 --> 58:13.220
other stuff that he has on here, you know, bad food and everything.

58:13.220 --> 58:14.220
Somebody agrees with him.

58:14.220 --> 58:15.220
He's a politician.

58:15.220 --> 58:17.220
Somebody voted for him.

58:17.220 --> 58:23.440
Honestly, this actually isnít the first time Iíve heard about the food specific one and

58:23.440 --> 58:27.520
part of me agrees with it because honestly, I do think that those industries need to be

58:27.520 --> 58:33.980
penalized for basically poisoning our country and I mean this in all seriousness, I think

58:33.980 --> 58:40.300
youíve noticed that obesity is on the rise among Americans, itís epidemic, I mean seriously

58:40.300 --> 58:42.040
itís horrible.

58:42.040 --> 58:45.700
So I actually sort of support that, you know the tax on sugarÖ

58:45.700 --> 58:52.360
but to that extreme. However, keep in mind that the fast food industry also lobbies heavily

58:52.360 --> 58:56.160
and pays the government a lot of money to stay in business.

58:56.160 --> 59:00.960
I wonder what the property taxes on this guy's giant ranch he probably has. Oh, maybe that's

59:00.960 --> 59:04.360
why he wants to remove property tax and tax all these things. He probably doesn't have

59:04.360 --> 59:10.640
anything to do. I mean, who's going to, you know, I really don't get it. I mean, I think

59:10.640 --> 59:12.920
it's stupid. His violent game thing, I think, is going

59:12.920 --> 59:16.120
completely flop because if we want to be completely honest violent game can

59:16.120 --> 59:21.440
include anything from say like Mario Brothers where you bop each other and

59:21.440 --> 59:27.000
monsters on the head to deer hunter and we're talking about Texas and it ain't

59:27.000 --> 59:31.840
gonna fly it comes back to where's the definition of violent game we have these

59:31.840 --> 59:35.540
politicians that are flinging about the term violent video game where's the

59:35.540 --> 59:40.880
definition what is the impartial party that makes a call on what constitutes a

59:40.880 --> 59:42.980
violent video game and what doesn't

59:42.980 --> 59:44.600
it's it's too it's too

59:44.600 --> 59:48.520
gray for me that's what i don't like about these laws that violent video game

59:48.520 --> 59:49.980
is not like the buzzword

59:49.980 --> 59:54.280
and and uh... the political world don't worry though for the uh... determine

59:54.280 --> 59:56.760
whether games are going to be violent or not

59:56.760 --> 01:00:00.960
he's got that covered he's gonna have a ten person panel that's gonna help but

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:02.260
the team

01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:03.360
determine which

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:07.560
games are violent and uh...

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:12.600
the tax itself will be levied against publishers of said games

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:17.320
what okay so a ten person panel who goes on that panel who audits that panel

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:19.240
what if the panel's getting paid off you know

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:22.420
where's the checks and balances here

01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:25.680
i don't know it still seems too simple of a solution to a more

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:27.100
complicated problem

01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:31.720
i think it's perfect i think that his solutions flawless i mean

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:36.160
i don't see any flaw with you know his theory on being able to you know squeeze

01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:41.860
money out of the publishers of course that's gonna fly I'm sure his interests

01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:46.700
are really on the good of humanity and not like you know some other third you

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:51.380
know party interest like oil or something like that the greatest

01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:56.500
politicians come out of Texas you have to understand that let's see hit stun

01:00:56.500 --> 01:01:00.500
once this wants to ask what is it with the rest of the u.s. and its obsession

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:05.860
with done laws and lawsuits hmm fire obama says some politician wanted to do

01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:10.640
the junk food tax in New York City and got shot down.

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:17.200
Also in chat, Zander C says, I love Texas, the politics suck, but the residents are actually

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:18.200
really cool.

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:19.200
I agree.

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:20.580
I know some nice, some very wonderful people from Texas.

01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:21.580
Ms. Tia is from Texas.

01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:26.500
That's right, and the old radio show I used to do, they're in Texas now, so good time.

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:29.460
You know what I think they should do as far as the food, and I've heard the suggestion

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:35.200
brought up they should actually subsidize the cost of fresh produce for

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:38.240
you know low-income families because actually the ones who actually support

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:42.720
the industry most of all and statistically is shown to be people of

01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:47.240
low-income families cuz honestly it's cheap food hmm you know and actually if

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:52.880
this is gonna you know what they adhere at McDonald's meet with shy gross

01:01:52.880 --> 01:02:02.720
everyone out why not cow eyeballs you it's still beef or beefy all right all

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:05.200
right let's let's move on there I thought you're gonna say tofu I was

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:09.320
really scared yeah let's bring it back to games here for a little bit let's

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:14.080
move on over to what's going on with the e3 Expo and what could possibly be

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:20.120
another politically motivated event I don't know Jamie well you know a lot of

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:29.920
Some of the guys go to E3 for the games, some go for the special presentations, but a good

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:33.640
number of the average goer goes to see scantily clad women.

01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:34.640
Guess what?

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:35.640
You lose!

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:38.000
How so?

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:43.480
That is because the video game industry recently got the big ol' kick in the butt from federal

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:48.200
and local politicians who want to limit the sales of violent and sexually explicit games

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:53.060
to minors, therefore there is a new ban.

01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:58.220
Coming from the Entertainment Software Association, who is the promoter of E3, says materials

01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:03.400
including live models, conduct that is sexually explicit and or sexually provocative, including

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:08.080
but not limited to nudity, partial nudity, and bathing suit bottoms, are prohibited from

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:12.880
the show floor, all common areas, and at any access points to the show.

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:16.160
However, faking orgasms is okay.

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:17.160
Which I will do in public.

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:23.160
Oh, really? Oh, really? I think we just got that on record here.

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:26.160
Stay tuned to E3, Thursday edition.

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.160
I was lying.

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:29.160
Jamie will be at Konami Saturday.

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:30.160
There's more!

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:31.160
Yes.

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:35.160
Exhibitors will receive a verbal warning when they violate this rule.

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:41.160
A second violation says they'll impose a $5,000 penalty payable immediately.

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:47.000
This would also require that the models comply with the dress code before returning to the

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.720
floor.

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:52.080
And what happens if you're not able to pay the $5,000 fee?

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:53.360
I guess you're out.

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:54.360
I guess they shut you down.

01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:55.720
I haven't seen anything specific like that.

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:57.720
What happens if they're not on the floor?

01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:00.080
They could be swinging above the floor.

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:01.520
What if they're walking around outside the building?

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:02.520
Floor in general.

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:07.360
As in floor as in defined as the presentation area.

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:11.000
Now if they're in the bathroom, I don't think that's a problem.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.400
Go see the new booth for Rockstar Games in the men's bathroom.

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:19.640
That's fine, they'll just be scantily clad models outside of E3.

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:20.640
Ahh!

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:24.880
Now, I actually read somewhere in some story that was a follow-up to this, it's not really

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:30.040
a new rule, but that they've dug up this rule that was all, they say it was always there,

01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:33.080
we're just, you know, we're restating our enforcement policy.

01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:38.520
Is that like those laws where it's illegal to tie up an alligator to a parking meter?

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:43.040
It was like really obscene laws. I used to live in Chico, California, and it was really

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:47.980
famous for this law, one of those stupid laws. It's illegal to detonate a nuclear device

01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:50.100
within the city limits. Duh!

01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:56.100
Oh darn! I had one ready to go!

01:04:56.100 --> 01:05:01.060
I mean, come on. So anyway, what do you think? Good thing? Bad thing?

01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:03.740
It's hard not to after eating Taco Bell.

01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:09.060
we're going to get some hate mail from the fast food industry tonight

01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:12.100
anyway um what are you going to try to keep things moving here

01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:17.060
good idea bad idea who cares what I I think it's stupid

01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:20.660
once again do they actually pay attention to the rules have they read

01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:21.620
the rules because

01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:25.060
last time I checked you know they're trying not to you know

01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:29.380
expose minors to nudity and violence and stuff

01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:32.620
um there are no minors that attend E3

01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:37.120
It's 18 and over, dumbasses! What the hell? I mean, who cares?

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:41.820
So what? They're partially nude. They're portraying, you know, game people. They get people to the booths.

01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:45.420
That's all. I mean, I don't understand what the big deal is.

01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:49.320
You know, why are they getting all their panties in a bunch over something stupid like this?

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.020
Are they hurting that bad for money?

01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:53.720
Well, actually they won't be able to get their panties in a bunch because they can't wear those.

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:56.720
They have to, you know, ask me granny panties but covered.

01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:01.520
Fine! I hope they have some really fucking skin tight shit because that's what's gonna happen.

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:04.560
they can be covered but it's gonna be showing everything

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:08.920
so I don't know I think it's really stupid the rule I mean I understand

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:12.920
you know people are always saying oh they're victimized

01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:17.440
whatever you know people go for the booth babes no one goes for the booth babes

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:20.440
they go to see the games the booth babes are just an added bonus it's like

01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:23.920
it's like getting you know free curly fries with your you know

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:28.100
ultimate cheeseburger you know it's just an added bonus I go to see the

01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:32.900
the booth boys. Like the men dressed up in medieval outfits, looking all hardcore.

01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:36.700
That's hot. And John Cena. Let's go into some chat room feedback here.

01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:38.540
Let's see.

01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:43.300
MiniMe283 says, if you want a bunch of scantily clad women, go to the

01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:46.620
scantily clad women expo. You want games, go to E3.

01:06:46.620 --> 01:06:51.260
My rebuttal is this.

01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:55.180
First off, if you got people, what they need to do is cut down the amount of people that go

01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:58.060
to E3 and then we'll all have a problem because there'll be less people

01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:00.960
there and more time for me to play some actual games.

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:04.240
That actually has been taken care of. From what I understand,

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:08.000
at least as far as my contacts have advised me,

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.200
people in retail short of managers

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:16.720
are going to be prohibited from attending E3 without express permission.

01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:21.480
Interesting. Yeah, that won't stop G4 from having 400 billion interns there.

01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:24.280
Yeah, but they're not doing video games anymore. I mean, haven't you noticed?

01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:28.140
Moving on, other feedback from the chat room. Tomo-kun says, uh, where are the booth studs?

01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:31.920
Where are the booth studs? Jamie, where were the booth studs at E3?

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:34.680
They were usually in the hallway.

01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:38.300
Okay.

01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:43.880
Well, we'll see what happens with this as it develops and how folks get

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:47.260
creative at E3 this year. You know what, though? Honestly, I don't think it's

01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:49.880
gonna be that much different. You're still gonna see sexy women walking around.

01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:50.700
It's just that they

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:54.540
They won't be wearing anything too revealing. You know what I mean?

01:07:54.900 --> 01:08:01.460
There's you know, those Hooters outfits are still pretty covering but they show off everything that need to be seen. You know, it's I

01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:07.700
Think I don't think much will change. I think I think it's getting blown. I think the reasons though their excuses

01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:13.180
Oh, it's because the hot coffee cry everyone's blaming goddamn rock star for everything

01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:17.200
It's retarded our booth babes appropriate at a gaming expo. Yes

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:22.080
Yes! They even have booth babes at car shows. They have booth babes probably at computer

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:27.880
shows. I mean, it's just kind of a thing that you do at expos. They have scally-clad women

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:34.880
at anime conventions, so I mean, granted they may not look as nice as these models, but

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:41.880
they do have them, and it's just something that goes with conventions. Big deal. I mean,

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:46.320
I mean it's it's getting you to go visit their booth that is the whole point of it

01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:52.700
It's it's you know one step short of you know launching fireworks into the you know show floor

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:59.400
It's pretty much it. You know whether it be you know rappers people yelling scaly-clad women you know for photo ops

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:01.920
That's why they're there

01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:04.280
All right, let's keep it moving

01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:09.360
Going to a completely different topic here again if you guys want to give some feedback mailbag at orange on trader calm

01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:11.280
We'll get into your emails

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:13.720
Sometime in the next hour, but for now we're trying to wrap up this hour

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:17.820
So we're gonna keep it moving and Loki what's going on with Final Fantasy 11?

01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:21.340
We I know we talked about the ninja and pirate thing Mikul Tov, but there's there's more

01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:23.100
Final Fantasy 11 news coming

01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:28.460
Well Final Fantasy 11 is set to debut on the 360 April 18th in North America

01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:33.500
Following with a dual release in Japan and Europe only two days later on April 20th

01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:39.500
it'll also feature the brand new expansion the treasures of Ot Urgun and

01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:44.820
and basically the expansion for the PC will also coincide with the launch

01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:49.460
as well. And one thing to mention that

01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:53.020
you still require that you have a hard drive

01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:56.220
and Xbox Live account for

01:09:56.220 --> 01:10:00.500
this and also the game is still going to suck on the 360.

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:04.800
So yeah, if you're really looking forward to an actual RPG for the 360

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:07.880
you may think about picking it up

01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:11.640
otherwise if you have one already on the PC you're probably good for that

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:15.040
I heard you can get a moogle rod if you go to that

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:18.080
live event they're doing, I think it's in March or something

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:21.120
in Santa Cruz, aren't they doing that? You can get a moogle rod

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:24.600
it's a little rod with a moogle at the end, looks cute

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:28.760
wow you mean they're not gonna give me a better version of Final Fantasy for the

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:32.960
360 that might actually use the hardware for it or might even be in high def

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:34.740
But it's a moogle rod!

01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:39.800
Oh, I'm sorry, that totally makes you up for the crappy game they're giving me for

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:42.480
sixty dollars.

01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:44.520
Let's talk about another MMO, shall we?

01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:48.360
Let's talk about World of Warcraft. This is huge. This is big news that's been

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:51.400
going around this week, and I'm going to pull this particular

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:55.280
telling of the tale from worldofwar.net is where I'm looking at this,

01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:59.360
and it has to do with the GLBT debate going on in World of Warcraft.

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:02.740
GLBT, of course, standing for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender.

01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:04.580
What the hell is the debate going on?

01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:09.040
What happened is that there was a player, her name is Sarah Andrews, and she was advertising

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:15.780
for a guild, her GLBT friendly guild, which was OZ, and it was the name of the guild,

01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:17.020
and it was on one of the servers.

01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:22.080
I don't remember the name of the server off the top of my head, but this player was issued

01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:27.780
with a warning from Blizzard under the harassment sexual orientation policy.

01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:32.580
So in other words, she's out in, you know, the town, as often happens in MMOs, people

01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:36.140
are shouting, you know, complete this quest, I want to do this, you know, who's got this

01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:38.140
item for me, who can do enchanting?

01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:42.460
But she's shouting for her guild, and shouting for guild recruitment is not an uncommon thing,

01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:46.580
you see it in most MMOs, right, Final Fantasy XI, whatever, but her thing was that she was

01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:51.220
shouting and it said somewhere at the end, you know, GLBT friendly or GLBT okay, something

01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:52.220
like that.

01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:58.080
from Blizzard saying that that was you know that GLBT they that they don't want

01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:03.320
those type of social issues being promoted in the game chat it's not now

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:08.720
they're saying it's not just GLBT but they're saying you know political and

01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:14.080
religious would also be on the no-no list for this. Where in the licensing

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:17.640
agreement did it say so? They keep quoting a part of it I don't know but

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:21.480
here's the I don't have the specific on where it's on the agreement but Blizzard

01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:24.840
Blizzard actually posted a response in their forums, and I actually saw this post for myself

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:29.200
on one of the chats in the forums there, it came from a Blizzard rep, it said, apologies

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:31.760
for the length of time it took to get this information out to you.

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:35.920
We encourage community building among our players with others of similar interests and

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:39.720
we understand that guilds are one of the primary ways to forge these communities.

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:44.480
However, topics related to sensitive real world subjects, such as religious, sexual,

01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:48.360
or political preference, for example, have had a tendency to result in communication

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:51.440
between players that often breaks down into harassment.

01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:55.160
To promote a positive game environment for everyone and help prevent such harassment

01:12:55.160 --> 01:13:00.040
from taking place as best we can, we prohibit mention of topics related to sensitive real-world

01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:04.340
subjects in open chat within the game, and we do our best to take action whenever we

01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:06.640
see such topics being broadcast.

01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:11.320
This includes openly advertising a guild friendly to players based on a particular political,

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:14.520
sexual or religious preference, to list a few examples.

01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:18.620
For guilds that wish to use such topics as part of their recruiting efforts, our Guild

01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:24.020
recruitment forum located at our community website serves as one open avenue for doing

01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:25.020
so.

01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:28.180
We will be clarifying some of the language in our game policies in order to help avoid

01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:30.020
such confusion in the future."

01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:32.020
So that was the response from Blizzard.

01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:38.060
But I don't know, for some folks this isn't good enough and I can kind of see why because,

01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:41.220
you know, I don't know how much you guys have played World of Warcraft these online games

01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:45.100
and sometimes there's people around the town going, you know, stop being such a fag and

01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:46.100
stuff like that.

01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:47.100
And it's kind of like, you know...

01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:48.100
Where's their warning?

01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:49.140
Exactly, where's their warning?

01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:52.660
And Blizzard says, you have to warn us about that every time.

01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:56.740
And I thought there was a very excellent response.

01:13:56.740 --> 01:14:00.860
I was actually looking at the Gamers Experimentations Forum, which is a gamer message forum, and

01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:05.500
somebody on there had a response to something like, why are you punishing the people on

01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:06.500
this end of this?

01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:08.660
I'm not doing a direct quote, I'm doing what I remember here.

01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:10.820
Why are you punishing the people that are trying to promote this?

01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:13.140
Why aren't you punishing the people?

01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:17.860
If you're saying that you're trying to do this because it could constitute harassment,

01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:23.240
it may turn into harassment later on, why aren't you doing anything about the harassment?

01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:27.680
Why is it that you do it on this end and not on the end when it turns into harassment?

01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:28.680
Other thoughts on this?

01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:32.220
I have more to add, but I want to see your guys' initial thoughts on this.

01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:33.220
Anybody?

01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:36.980
Was she a sexy night elf?

01:14:36.980 --> 01:14:38.180
I really don't know.

01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:40.140
I really don't know if she was a sexy night elf or not.

01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:47.460
I'm afraid I can't comment on this dark Sakura you know I actually agree with

01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:54.620
what you were saying on that you know I think it's very touchy you know it's not

01:14:54.620 --> 01:15:01.540
something that they can penalize one party for and not penalize other parties

01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:09.060
addressing in different manners you know I I think that they're they took

01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:13.420
something and push it a bit too out you know I don't think she's doing anything

01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:21.420
wrong no definitely not definitely not I know it's it's tough it's tough okay I'm

01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:24.020
gonna I'm gonna say something I'm gonna clarify something on the podcast which

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:27.060
I don't think I've ever said on the podcast before but I just wanna make

01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:32.460
sure this is understood I am a gay gamer so if that's a problem for anybody out

01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:37.280
there hello and welcome to 2006 get over it anyway and obviously it's not been an

01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:41.580
issue in the past year of podcasts we've done. We've never had an excuse to bring

01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:44.720
that subject up before, but now we do. I want to give you my perspective on this

01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:50.720
as a gay gamer. When I first read about this story and heard about it, I actually

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:54.560
kind of thought I didn't quite understand the big deal because I'm like

01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:59.080
okay I understand Blizzard has this policy where they don't want that kind

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:02.400
of stuff being brought up in game and I can kind of see that. It's that you know

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:06.640
it's a game and they want to keep some of that real-world stuff out of it and

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:08.640
And, okay, that's cool.

01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:11.640
But my problem is, is I think Blizzard is kind of half-assed

01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:12.960
with their enforcement of it sometimes,

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:15.440
because there are still people in the game that shout,

01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:16.960
you know, stop being such a fag,

01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:19.520
and Chuck Norris is a fag, and whatever that stuff is,

01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:21.040
you know, and don't get me wrong,

01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:22.840
I'm okay with the occasional gay joke,

01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:25.000
as I think most gay people are.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.240
I'm okay with that kind of stuff.

01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:27.360
You know, there's a difference between doing something

01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:30.040
in jest, and then doing something with malice.

01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:31.080
You know what I mean?

01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:33.960
So, anyway, and I think if, you know,

01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:35.800
if you're in a guild where people can tease each other,

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:39.440
it's okay. I've been in those types of guilds before. I had one in Final Fantasy XI. It

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:43.600
wasn't a gay guild, so to speak, it was a GLBT friendly guild, because there were lots

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:44.680
of gay guys in it.

01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:47.720
And I don't think that's, the way that it sounded like that they were advertising the

01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:52.280
guild, it didn't sound that, you know, offensive anyways. It wasn't like saying, yeah, if you

01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:56.520
like eating carpet, you know, come on our way, you know. If you like taking up the ass,

01:16:56.520 --> 01:17:03.520
we're the guild for you, or something. I mean, it wasn't offensive at all. It's, you know.

01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:05.520
Was it was a disclaimer?

01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:07.720
to be honest just

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:12.200
She the she did it the right way. She said hey, I've got this guild

01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:17.880
It's a great guild and put a disclaimer to clarify. That's how I see it. Okay now

01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:22.500
Here and I that's kind of my my thought on it was my initial thought with it

01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:23.440
It was kind of like you know what?

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:29.200
I think the big problem here was the way they responded to her if they had just said you know what you know if they

01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:34.360
hadn't said oh this is a hurry you violated our harassment policy that was

01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:38.200
the problem I think I should have treated it a little differently as one

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:45.040
who has done chat moderating before night right oh I used to be a chat host

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:51.440
for AOL right in the day you are given set macro responses you have to respond

01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:55.760
with a macro they are all approved by their legal and whoever the hell they

01:17:55.760 --> 01:18:01.880
are, um, clarification can be provided by contacting, at least through AOL, their, uh,

01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:08.340
terms of service people, which I would expect this is the same situation because technically

01:18:08.340 --> 01:18:15.200
it is chat monitoring, all the shouting and everything, it would be responded to with

01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:19.880
some sort of pre-approved macro and they pick the most appropriate one.

01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:24.140
Since it specifically relates to that policy, that is the policy quoted.

01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:30.820
their macros suck okay but here here it is so I was I was okay with blizzards

01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:33.460
response I was still kind of like I wish they would say something a little more

01:18:33.460 --> 01:18:36.720
firm about this I wish they'd be consistent but here's now where I have a

01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:40.420
problem blizzard says that they want to keep this stuff out of their game right

01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:44.740
that's sexual and stuff of this nature has no place in their game right listen

01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:51.100
to this this is a clip of what a tauren male might say if you type slash silly

01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:58.300
homogenized no way I like the ladies so in the game a torn male might say

01:18:58.300 --> 01:19:03.700
homogenized no way I like the ladies now that's the type of joke that usually

01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:07.020
would make me laugh but now that I think about it in this context where Blizzard

01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:11.980
says we don't this kind of thing has no place in our game I go hello they've

01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:15.820
included it hello is this a bit of an inconsistency here's another one listen

01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:20.660
to this if you use a torn male once again with slash flirt free rides for

01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:25.720
the ladies free rides for the ladies what if I'm on a roleplay server and

01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:28.720
what if I'm in a gay guild that was promoted the appropriate way and I want

01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:32.360
my character to be a gay character now usually I would not take issue with this

01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:38.800
I understand that okay heterosexual is is kind of the majority or whatever and

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:43.400
I can take this stuff in jest you know I'm not I'm not GLAAD okay I don't have

01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:46.100
a problem with these sound clips by themselves it's fine they're being

01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:49.920
purely hypocritical this dad now that now it's a hypocrisy that's the problem

01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:53.120
on top of that for them to even have that in the game and have it that would

01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:54.680
have to be approved by

01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:58.320
their QA by you know whatever

01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:02.480
legal review they have it go through that had to have been approved by

01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:03.160
somebody

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:06.360
and then for them to go in and have this

01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:10.800
this rule in place this type of standard that they're trying to adhere to

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:15.200
yet have it built into the game itself something completely opposite

01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:19.840
so anyway I kinda wanna keep things moving any other feedback

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:24.840
I'm still going to play it. It doesn't bother me in the least.

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:27.840
And you're okay with me saying you're a gay gamer too.

01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:31.840
Well, you just have no feeling about this? No reaction?

01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:34.840
I think Blizzard's stupid for saying,

01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:38.840
oh, we don't want it in our game, and then that clip of the Tauren talking.

01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:42.840
Whatever, I'm a troll, I don't even hear that.

01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:46.840
I'm just going to keep shooting things with my arrows and sending my scorpion after it.

01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:49.960
I play a night elf in an undead, so whatever.

01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:57.040
I think now, see, I think a lot of the gay folks and my peers, essentially, were quick

01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:59.320
to shun World of Warcraft pretty quickly.

01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:04.960
I think Blizzard needs a chance to kind of clarify their policies and whatever, but I

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:08.780
do see there's an inconsistency here that needs to be addressed, and if it's not addressed,

01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:10.200
I'm not going to be happy.

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:13.400
Next two patches, I bet you anything, those clips will be changed.

01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:14.400
We'll see.

01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:18.720
least if Blizzard doesn't want to I'd say lose some of their clientele they

01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:26.600
better change it we'll see um if they're gonna get all you know angry about

01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:29.760
somebody shouting for that can they please get angry about the Chuck Norris

01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:32.700
things because I'm really sick of those and I think that constitutes as

01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:38.040
harassment that I have to put it up with that I agree too all right anyway we

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:41.360
got to keep it moving here we're running really long for the first hour we're

01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:44.600
We're almost in the first hour and a half here.

01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:45.740
Do you guys maybe want to just go ahead

01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:46.840
and go to our break now,

01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:48.720
and then we'll come back for the next part?

01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:51.200
But remember, Chuck Norris doesn't sleep.

01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:52.760
He waits.

01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:53.600
Oh my God.

01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:56.640
All right, we're gonna go ahead and do a break.

01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:58.420
When we come back, we're gonna talk about

01:21:58.420 --> 01:21:59.720
Konami Gamer's Day.

01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:01.120
We're gonna talk about the possibilities

01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:03.960
of Microsoft entering the home market, baby.

01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:04.800
We'll see, we'll see.

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:06.080
That was going around this week.
