00:13.141 --> 00:15.143
[SPEAKER_01]: And now the conclusion of episode 172 for January 29, 2006.

00:19.984 --> 00:26.745
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 172 for this, January the 29th of 2006.

00:27.466 --> 00:30.486
[SPEAKER_03]: And quite a busy first half there.

00:30.746 --> 00:32.267
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of controversy.

00:32.687 --> 00:35.567
[SPEAKER_03]: Was there a single controversial subject we didn't touch there in the first half?

00:35.607 --> 00:36.187
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.

00:36.247 --> 00:41.548
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about politics, sexuality, fast food, everything.

00:41.568 --> 00:43.869
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't talk about midget rights.

00:44.989 --> 00:45.749
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe in this half.

00:45.789 --> 00:46.149
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

00:47.030 --> 00:48.310
[SPEAKER_08]: There need to be more midget gamers.

00:49.150 --> 00:55.473
[SPEAKER_03]: For those that are listening to this on the podcast feed who haven't heard the first half of the show yet, definitely go back and download the first half.

00:55.834 --> 00:57.654
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good show, so check it out.

00:58.355 --> 01:02.857
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, we're going to get back in because we have a lot of stuff to talk about in this half of the show.

01:04.878 --> 01:08.940
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll start off with Loki, who's got a story about Microsoft.

01:09.381 --> 01:10.561
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on with Microsoft?

01:10.881 --> 01:12.242
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they doing the handhelds or not?

01:12.282 --> 01:14.063
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a rumor that's been going on for a long time.

01:14.383 --> 01:14.703
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

01:15.724 --> 01:17.625
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, I think, the official response from

01:18.725 --> 01:29.828
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something that they're looking towards because they want to compete with the iPod and they're looking at maybe starting up a portable gaming development team or something like that or portable something development team.

01:30.429 --> 01:31.829
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a maybe.

01:32.149 --> 01:34.890
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty much I think what the official word's been.

01:35.650 --> 01:40.171
[SPEAKER_04]: Something of course they're going to look at if they can figure out a way to do it profitably.

01:42.660 --> 01:48.631
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be one of those things like, okay, well, we'll see what happens, but I'm not going to say yay or nay on it.

01:48.871 --> 01:55.763
[SPEAKER_04]: There's definitely not any firm plans on it, so it's just going to have to wait for that.

01:58.368 --> 01:58.728
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:00.468 --> 02:05.590
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on, I have some feedback from the chat room on the controversial subject.

02:05.630 --> 02:08.570
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody mentioned that we didn't mention Jack Thompson yet during the program.

02:08.610 --> 02:10.190
[SPEAKER_03]: Tony mentioned that in the chat room there.

02:10.611 --> 02:11.391
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank God.

02:11.491 --> 02:14.191
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I should give you guys an update on the Flowers for Jack campaign.

02:14.211 --> 02:17.212
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember we talked about that last week and how we contributed $20 to that effort?

02:17.472 --> 02:17.912
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what?

02:17.972 --> 02:21.213
[SPEAKER_03]: They raised a crazy amount of money.

02:21.273 --> 02:26.414
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they posted the final figure yet, but when I last checked, they had something like over $900.00.

02:27.754 --> 02:54.475
[SPEAKER_03]: and it got to the point where it was they're going to spend $650 on the flowers and the rest they're donating to and forgive me, I don't have time to dig for this right now I think it's called Child's Play which is the foundation that the Penny Arcade folks set up when they were getting hit with the Jack Thompson stuff too so that's great, it's been a fundraiser in many ways That's a good thing Awesome, so congratulations to the Flowers for Jack folks So now we've mentioned that

02:56.240 --> 02:56.440
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

03:26.567 --> 03:27.688
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really my F.U.

03:28.008 --> 03:31.370
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I actually mentioned it already in the show, but F.U.

03:31.390 --> 03:33.791
[SPEAKER_08]: to that woman at Barnes & Noble.

03:34.152 --> 03:37.114
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, just a big stinking pile of poo on her.

03:37.814 --> 03:48.420
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if you're going to say excuse me, even if the people haven't heard you, you still wait to acknowledge that they've heard you before shoving somebody out of the way.

03:48.961 --> 03:51.322
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, what has happened to the state of manners here?

03:51.662 --> 03:53.624
[SPEAKER_08]: How's that that she had her grandchildren with her?

03:54.799 --> 03:58.241
[SPEAKER_08]: She's teaching them that it is okay to push people out of the way.

03:58.282 --> 04:01.344
[SPEAKER_08]: See, Jack Thompson needs to focus on behavior like that.

04:02.224 --> 04:10.110
[SPEAKER_08]: On just general rudeness and the fact that people go around insulting and will not admit when they were the one who were at fault.

04:11.531 --> 04:11.831
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm done.

04:12.291 --> 04:19.216
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, my FU of the week is going towards, you know, this is basically I have nothing right now.

04:20.176 --> 04:22.178
[SPEAKER_04]: Planet Earth for being a cocky bitch.

04:24.391 --> 04:24.732
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

04:25.693 --> 04:27.636
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, this planet is a cocky bitch.

04:27.676 --> 04:34.044
[SPEAKER_04]: It thinks it's like all, you know, holier than thou just because, you know, it's got life on it or something.

04:34.104 --> 04:34.445
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

04:35.046 --> 04:35.927
[SPEAKER_04]: I got nothing, really.

04:36.047 --> 04:36.347
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't.

04:36.387 --> 04:37.309
[SPEAKER_04]: My week was okay.

04:37.549 --> 04:39.171
[SPEAKER_04]: I have nothing that really pisses me off.

04:39.271 --> 04:39.892
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait, I do.

04:40.153 --> 04:40.533
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

04:40.553 --> 04:41.054
[SPEAKER_04]: I take that back.

04:42.349 --> 04:48.512
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck yous, those goddamn people that keep parking in the fire lane, thinking that it's their own personal parking space, even though there's a red curb there.

04:49.172 --> 04:53.374
[SPEAKER_04]: Every goddamn day, there's a car parked there, and nobody tickets these cars.

04:53.855 --> 04:55.075
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, fuck them, you see?

04:55.796 --> 05:05.841
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if I want to back out of my car, you know, back out of my space, which happens to be in the corner of this entire parking lot, you know, I have to avoid these people that are parked in these illegal spaces.

05:06.201 --> 05:10.463
[SPEAKER_04]: And the audacity of these people, they actually, you know, look at me like...

05:11.209 --> 05:11.409
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

05:12.030 --> 05:13.370
[SPEAKER_04]: You're in my way, you know?

05:13.390 --> 05:14.331
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, fuck them!

05:15.352 --> 05:17.433
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate my apartment complex.

05:17.453 --> 05:19.014
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I knew you had it in you, being a liar.

05:19.034 --> 05:20.695
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also hate her, because she is a cockatoo.

05:21.826 --> 05:29.069
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, my FU of the week goes to the Italian restaurant in Sacramento, and I'm not even going to name it because nobody outside the area would know it anyway.

05:29.390 --> 05:30.830
[SPEAKER_03]: They gave me food poisoning yesterday.

05:31.190 --> 05:35.772
[SPEAKER_03]: My pasta, like I had this dish that was lasagna and pasta, it was like a little bit of both.

05:36.013 --> 05:44.556
[SPEAKER_03]: The pasta was cold, and I should have known that something was wrong then, because that probably means my meat lasagna was undercooked, and I got very, very sick last night, and that's no fun at all.

05:44.777 --> 05:45.757
[SPEAKER_03]: Food poisoning sucks.

05:46.217 --> 05:47.798
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, thank you, Jake.

05:48.308 --> 05:49.348
[SPEAKER_03]: You're listening to KTMI.

05:49.449 --> 05:50.629
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's change the subject promptly.

06:09.659 --> 06:09.899
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

06:34.117 --> 06:40.560
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want you to feel left out, so we have gifts for DarkSakura that we brought back from Gamer's Day.

06:40.621 --> 06:41.461
[SPEAKER_03]: No, stop crying.

06:41.481 --> 06:42.241
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to love these gifts.

06:42.702 --> 06:43.922
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a poster.

06:44.022 --> 06:46.343
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Metal Gear Saga poster.

06:46.844 --> 06:47.444
[SPEAKER_03]: Very rare.

06:47.704 --> 06:48.404
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a promotional poster.

06:48.424 --> 06:49.025
[SPEAKER_03]: Metal Gear.

06:49.085 --> 06:49.565
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

06:50.045 --> 06:51.166
[SPEAKER_03]: And check this out.

06:51.886 --> 06:53.107
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what I do with press kits.

06:53.939 --> 07:01.746
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to give Jamie the press kit for Metal Gear Saga as well so she can check that out with her husband Dan who's a big Metal Gear fan as well.

07:02.466 --> 07:04.428
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what he was playing today was Gran Turismo 2.

07:04.788 --> 07:05.009
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

07:05.569 --> 07:06.550
[SPEAKER_03]: That has nothing to do with Metal Gear.

07:06.590 --> 07:07.010
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

07:08.412 --> 07:08.692
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

07:09.232 --> 07:10.013
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't feel left out.

07:10.033 --> 07:10.393
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

07:10.774 --> 07:15.958
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm giving you guys that press kit for a reason so you can report on that for the site too and the stuff blog.

07:16.038 --> 07:17.319
[SPEAKER_07]: It even smells pressy.

07:17.439 --> 07:17.740
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

07:18.843 --> 07:23.348
[SPEAKER_03]: So meanwhile, while Jamie's oogling that, Loki and I want to talk about Konami Gamers Day a little bit.

07:23.368 --> 07:27.113
[SPEAKER_03]: But Jamie, feel free to interject your thoughts because you probably have an opinion on these games as well.

07:27.393 --> 07:28.875
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what did you think of Konami Gamers Day?

07:28.955 --> 07:30.276
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a good time.

07:30.336 --> 07:31.518
[SPEAKER_03]: I loved it.

07:32.038 --> 07:37.705
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much to Konami for inviting us and letting the podcast world get exposure to that as well.

07:37.725 --> 07:38.426
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a good time.

07:39.706 --> 07:40.967
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about some of the games we saw.

07:41.867 --> 07:43.168
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you check out Tao's Adventure?

07:43.508 --> 07:43.928
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit.

07:44.468 --> 07:46.149
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a role-playing game coming out for the DS.

07:46.189 --> 07:46.969
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be out soon.

07:47.509 --> 07:48.570
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a little bit.

07:48.630 --> 07:51.891
[SPEAKER_03]: The build that they were showing there, though, was like the full game.

07:52.231 --> 07:55.672
[SPEAKER_03]: So it started me off from the beginning, so it was kind of slow to get into.

07:55.772 --> 07:59.614
[SPEAKER_03]: So I seriously spent like 30 minutes of this game and barely got anywhere.

07:59.734 --> 08:05.116
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I kind of learned that you cast spells by drawing little symbols on the bottom part, and you have to memorize, like,

08:05.396 --> 08:07.577
[SPEAKER_03]: to cast a lightning spell, you draw a little lightning bolt.

08:07.917 --> 08:11.978
[SPEAKER_03]: It seemed okay, but it seemed like kind of like just your average run-of-the-mill RPG.

08:12.218 --> 08:14.299
[SPEAKER_03]: There was nothing about it that really excited me.

08:14.839 --> 08:16.120
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you feel the same way, Loki.

08:16.140 --> 08:18.320
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was okay.

08:18.500 --> 08:24.643
[SPEAKER_03]: I think folks who are into RPGs and it seems like one of those monster collection type of games, you might get a kick out of that.

08:25.203 --> 08:26.103
[SPEAKER_03]: Street Supremacy.

08:26.603 --> 08:29.944
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what do you think of Street Supremacy, a racing game that's coming out for the PSP by Konami?

08:29.984 --> 08:31.125
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's actually pretty cool.

08:31.185 --> 08:34.866
[SPEAKER_04]: What it is, it's sort of a port of Tokyo Extreme Racer, so if you've

08:35.353 --> 08:38.854
[SPEAKER_04]: You've played that series, you pretty much kind of have an idea what this game is going to be like.

08:40.215 --> 08:40.875
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks pretty cool.

08:40.975 --> 08:49.799
[SPEAKER_04]: It reminded me, the comparison I had with it is, it reminded me of Wangdin's Midnight Toon, the arcade game.

08:49.819 --> 08:50.539
[SPEAKER_04]: It reminded me of that.

08:51.559 --> 08:52.760
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a pretty good game.

08:52.780 --> 08:58.022
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not that many racing games out there for the PSP, so, you know, more the merrier.

08:58.222 --> 09:01.023
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know the price point on it is pretty cheap when it's coming out, so...

09:01.881 --> 09:04.603
[SPEAKER_03]: I ran out of time to check out Street Supremacy, but it looked okay.

09:04.904 --> 09:06.525
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a huge on racing.

09:06.565 --> 09:08.086
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Burnout, but we'll see.

09:08.226 --> 09:08.807
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll check it out.

09:09.507 --> 09:12.270
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I liked a lot on the PSP was the Gradius Collection.

09:12.910 --> 09:13.331
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet.

09:13.611 --> 09:14.011
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.

09:14.031 --> 09:23.079
[SPEAKER_03]: I played through a little bit of Gradius 1, and it's cool because they changed it a little bit so that it's widescreen, and it doesn't really do it by stretching the image so much.

09:23.659 --> 09:29.163
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it happens a little bit, but they kind of went back and redid it, and you can tell they changed some things about the game, too.

09:29.244 --> 09:29.684
[SPEAKER_03]: For instance...

09:30.004 --> 09:37.086
[SPEAKER_03]: The first boss that you fight happens immediately after the volcano sequence in the first stage, for those of you guys that have played Gradius before.

09:37.366 --> 09:40.087
[SPEAKER_03]: So the volcanoes are in the way while you're trying to fight the boss.

09:40.107 --> 09:42.488
[SPEAKER_03]: So it adds a little bit of extra challenge to it, which I thought was kind of cool.

09:42.508 --> 09:44.448
[SPEAKER_08]: That means you can't sit in the hidey spot, right?

09:44.548 --> 09:45.588
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, exactly.

09:45.868 --> 09:48.849
[SPEAKER_03]: So they changed that a little bit, and they made it more seamless.

09:48.889 --> 09:50.410
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's a very seamless kind of game.

09:50.430 --> 09:53.451
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only one I checked out, but Gradius Collection is going to have several Gradius games in it.

09:53.471 --> 09:54.391
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what that's going to mean?

09:54.411 --> 09:56.871
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be nine versions of Gradius we own.

09:57.152 --> 09:58.072
[SPEAKER_03]: No Parodius, though.

09:58.092 --> 09:58.132
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

09:58.952 --> 10:00.313
[SPEAKER_08]: That makes me upset.

10:00.373 --> 10:01.454
[SPEAKER_08]: We need more Parodius.

10:01.754 --> 10:02.255
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe later.

10:02.895 --> 10:04.396
[SPEAKER_03]: Rumble Roses XX, Loki.

10:04.416 --> 10:05.397
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you check this one out?

10:05.477 --> 10:06.618
[SPEAKER_03]: This game's all TNA.

10:07.018 --> 10:08.419
[SPEAKER_03]: All TNA.

10:08.840 --> 10:14.684
[SPEAKER_03]: Rumble Roses is okay, but the problem I have with this game and wrestling games in general is that it's kind of slow.

10:15.044 --> 10:17.886
[SPEAKER_03]: The action's very slow in these kinds of games.

10:17.947 --> 10:18.627
[SPEAKER_03]: Very slow.

10:18.667 --> 10:19.288
[SPEAKER_04]: See, and that's the thing.

10:19.308 --> 10:26.153
[SPEAKER_04]: They were touting that the game had probably the best visuals on the 360, but the movements are all really jerky.

10:26.653 --> 10:26.773
[SPEAKER_04]: D.O.A.

10:26.793 --> 10:27.073
[SPEAKER_04]: 4 and D.O.A.

10:27.093 --> 10:27.754
[SPEAKER_04]: Beach Volleyball

10:49.984 --> 11:00.334
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting, because I was taking notes during the keynote speeches, and I remember Akari Uchida, who's the producer of Rumble Roses XX, said that they were making fun of DOA a little bit.

11:00.354 --> 11:00.675
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that?

11:00.695 --> 11:02.517
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, yeah, we're making fun of DOA in this part.

11:02.857 --> 11:04.098
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they have sequences in the game.

11:04.118 --> 11:10.965
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a photo shoot sequence, like you can take sexy pictures of the folks, and Loki summed it up.

11:11.005 --> 11:11.666
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all TNA.

11:11.866 --> 11:13.488
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's all TNA.

11:13.528 --> 11:13.788
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

11:14.358 --> 11:17.520
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun, and I think it's a party game to me.

11:17.540 --> 11:18.541
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be picking it up, for sure.

11:18.561 --> 11:21.143
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's watch the Super Bowl and play some Rumba Roses.

11:21.483 --> 11:22.264
[SPEAKER_04]: There's what?

11:22.284 --> 11:23.544
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one fighting game for the 360.

11:23.905 --> 11:25.206
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

11:25.446 --> 11:26.266
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to sell.

11:27.507 --> 11:29.008
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a pretty fun game.

11:29.629 --> 11:33.391
[SPEAKER_04]: And definitely, just for the T&A factor, it works.

11:33.892 --> 11:35.793
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll be able to play it online, which I thought was cool.

11:35.913 --> 11:39.235
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can customize your character, including the size of the boobs.

11:39.776 --> 11:42.698
[SPEAKER_03]: And the producer was kind of saying, oh, everybody...

11:42.998 --> 11:48.227
[SPEAKER_03]: It won't just be, you know, anesthesia versus anesthesia and they look the same.

11:48.527 --> 11:51.832
[SPEAKER_03]: You could customize the colors and the size and shape of it.

11:51.853 --> 11:54.457
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm like, okay, on live, they're all going to have huge tits.

11:54.517 --> 11:55.639
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a creator wrestler?

11:57.321 --> 12:01.363
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that was kind of their response to Create-A-Wrestler instead of being able to create one from scratch.

12:01.383 --> 12:02.123
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes and no.

12:02.204 --> 12:06.485
[SPEAKER_04]: They do, I think, have a Create-A-Wrestler, and then you can also modify the ones that they have on there.

12:06.706 --> 12:13.068
[SPEAKER_03]: I got the sense that Create-A-Wrestler was more you modify the existing ones significantly, not like Soul Calibur Create-A-Character.

12:13.409 --> 12:13.949
[SPEAKER_03]: A little different.

12:14.529 --> 12:14.909
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

12:15.289 --> 12:20.652
[SPEAKER_04]: But the other things that they were going to have, they were a little bit different with it.

12:21.772 --> 12:25.574
[SPEAKER_04]: I know other than the Create-A-Character type stuff, which was pretty cool,

12:26.035 --> 12:26.215
[SPEAKER_04]: Sub... Sub...

12:54.878 --> 12:55.658
[SPEAKER_03]: Sub-sta-nance

13:16.010 --> 13:17.991
[SPEAKER_03]: I like all the add-ons they're going to have for this.

13:18.031 --> 13:19.771
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you get the Metal Gear Saga DVD.

13:19.791 --> 13:20.911
[SPEAKER_03]: They were showing clips from that.

13:20.931 --> 13:21.752
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks very cool.

13:21.792 --> 13:25.693
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, only if you pre-order at a major retailer like GameStop or EV or whatever.

13:25.713 --> 13:26.953
[SPEAKER_04]: But most people are.

13:26.993 --> 13:28.414
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll probably be able to get it either way.

13:28.734 --> 13:31.334
[SPEAKER_03]: And the original Metal Gear on NES and Metal Gear 2.

13:31.394 --> 13:32.555
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

13:32.655 --> 13:33.515
[SPEAKER_07]: The MSX.

13:33.775 --> 13:34.715
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

13:34.975 --> 13:37.076
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the one that Kojima pretty much wrote off.

13:37.096 --> 13:37.376
[SPEAKER_03]: What was it?

13:37.396 --> 13:38.016
[SPEAKER_03]: Snake's Revenge?

13:38.056 --> 13:38.556
[SPEAKER_03]: Snake's Revenge, yeah.

13:38.576 --> 13:39.077
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that one.

13:39.197 --> 13:40.117
[SPEAKER_03]: The real Metal Gear 2.

13:40.677 --> 13:41.437
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that was interesting.

13:41.778 --> 13:43.759
[SPEAKER_08]: The MSX one was actually pretty fun.

13:43.799 --> 13:49.521
[SPEAKER_08]: And it had the things that they referred to back in the first Metal Gear Solid about Big Boss and Gray Fox.

13:50.102 --> 13:52.123
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of that was involved in Metal Gear 2.

13:52.964 --> 13:53.424
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet Coden 5

14:12.779 --> 14:19.289
[SPEAKER_03]: is another one I kind of ran out of time to look at, and it's a good thing Miklatov stepped out for a little bit, or he'd probably punch me right now because he loves Suikoden.

14:19.710 --> 14:20.631
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you check it out at all?

14:21.172 --> 14:22.554
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a huge Suikoden fan.

14:22.594 --> 14:23.175
[SPEAKER_04]: I looked at it.

14:23.315 --> 14:24.917
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked pretty, but, you know, it's...

14:25.540 --> 14:26.160
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

14:56.394 --> 14:57.794
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I played them.

14:58.054 --> 14:58.455
[SPEAKER_04]: They're cool.

14:58.755 --> 14:59.735
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like the new controller.

14:59.875 --> 15:00.935
[SPEAKER_03]: New controller doesn't stick.

15:19.318 --> 15:20.519
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, consider yourself lucky.

15:20.780 --> 15:22.261
[SPEAKER_03]: You still should pick up one of these U.S.

15:22.281 --> 15:22.521
[SPEAKER_03]: controllers.

15:22.541 --> 15:25.364
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a mutant controller, and I am going to pick up a U.S.

15:25.384 --> 15:25.664
[SPEAKER_04]: controller.

15:25.684 --> 15:30.049
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you do happen to have a controller, the game will be offered with the controller or without the controller.

15:30.289 --> 15:32.251
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I didn't pick that part out.

15:32.411 --> 15:34.533
[SPEAKER_08]: That means they know we're out there.

15:35.574 --> 15:38.196
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I have the advantage for working at a distributor.

15:38.376 --> 15:44.779
[SPEAKER_03]: For those of you guys concerned about the authenticity compared to the Japanese originals, I'm told that Anothers do show up in the game.

15:44.799 --> 15:50.062
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just locked away at the start, but you can unlock the Anothers for those of you guys that really want the difficult stuff.

15:50.463 --> 15:52.784
[SPEAKER_03]: I am hearing they changed some note charts.

15:53.164 --> 15:58.706
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm hearing from folks who play a lot of Beatmania that it's not as bad as you think.

15:58.986 --> 16:07.809
[SPEAKER_03]: They changed note charts, mostly to add in some of the free scratch zones and things, because they are bringing over the free scratch zones, which showed up, I think, in some early, early Beatmania games in the Beatmania 3.

16:07.869 --> 16:08.389
[SPEAKER_03]: They had that.

16:08.429 --> 16:15.372
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed it was in Metal Gear Solid, the remix, because I remember I have Beatmania 2 mix, and I don't remember the free scratching being there.

16:15.932 --> 16:18.214
[SPEAKER_04]: But they added that in there or something.

16:18.534 --> 16:19.255
[SPEAKER_08]: It was in 4th Mix.

16:19.275 --> 16:20.516
[SPEAKER_08]: It was in CM2.

16:21.097 --> 16:32.486
[SPEAKER_08]: It was also, I think, it was removed from, I think, if memory serves me correctly, I do think that it was in 2DX up until, I want to say, the Substream release.

16:33.027 --> 16:34.548
[SPEAKER_08]: The one that linked to DDR2 Mix.

16:34.628 --> 16:34.808
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

16:35.329 --> 16:36.910
[SPEAKER_08]: And then after that, no more.

16:38.447 --> 16:39.728
[SPEAKER_03]: Questions from chat room here.

16:39.788 --> 16:42.510
[SPEAKER_03]: Spirit Snare wants to know, how did the controller feel?

16:42.570 --> 16:43.110
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know.

16:43.450 --> 16:51.136
[SPEAKER_03]: It felt like the regular controllers to me, but just the key taps were a little different, but nothing that's going to throw you.

16:51.256 --> 16:52.917
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it feels nice.

16:52.957 --> 16:56.099
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the US players are going to be very pleased at the improvements over the Japanese controllers.

16:56.139 --> 16:56.519
[SPEAKER_03]: I really do.

16:56.859 --> 16:58.020
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm very excited about that.

17:00.953 --> 17:01.514
[SPEAKER_03]: Game Boy One

17:25.594 --> 17:27.316
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, they didn't say specifically.

17:27.516 --> 17:34.427
[SPEAKER_04]: It reminded me of them almost like selling a special features disc for the movie by itself.

17:34.447 --> 17:35.308
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it feels like.

17:35.748 --> 17:39.053
[SPEAKER_08]: They actually did that for Metal Gear Solid 2.

17:40.509 --> 17:42.630
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're actually doing something very similar for Metal Gear.

17:42.650 --> 17:46.052
[SPEAKER_03]: Now to bring that up, the Metal Gear comics, they're also going to be doing on the PSP.

17:46.092 --> 17:48.674
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have these comics on the PSP.

17:48.714 --> 17:50.915
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked very well detailed and well drawn.

17:50.935 --> 17:53.636
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked pretty cool and a little bit interactive as well.

17:53.976 --> 17:58.239
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know one thing they were really pushing during the keynotes was innovation.

17:58.279 --> 17:59.499
[SPEAKER_03]: Konami wants to innovate this year.

17:59.540 --> 18:01.921
[SPEAKER_03]: And these two products definitely show that, that they want to be innovative.

18:02.421 --> 18:19.251
[SPEAKER_03]: for me, the deciding factor on the Silent Hill experience is price point because if Silent Hill experience costs as much as a normal PSP game I don't think that's fair because it's not a game but if it's a $20 thing, I think it'll be great and they're not the only ones doing comics either Capcom is getting in on that kind of action as well

18:20.004 --> 18:25.949
[SPEAKER_04]: Metal Gear Acid 2 Metal Gear Acid 2 is pretty good.

18:26.049 --> 18:28.130
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't really care for the first one.

18:28.510 --> 18:29.471
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks pretty fun.

18:29.851 --> 18:34.615
[SPEAKER_04]: I really kind of wanted a Metal Gear Solid game, not really a card battle game.

18:34.715 --> 18:36.516
[SPEAKER_04]: I really hate card battle games.

18:37.397 --> 18:38.238
[SPEAKER_04]: Every single one of them.

18:38.478 --> 18:38.538
[SPEAKER_04]: The

18:40.689 --> 18:46.391
[SPEAKER_04]: Solid Eye wasn't as solid as I thought it was going to be.

18:46.431 --> 18:47.852
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to explain the Solid Eye.

18:47.952 --> 18:55.555
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually a cardboard cutout goggle thing that you can put over your PSP and the game will play in some 3D fashion.

18:55.935 --> 18:58.056
[SPEAKER_03]: I had Virtual Boy flashbacks playing this thing.

18:59.156 --> 18:59.996
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't work for me.

19:00.096 --> 19:01.736
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't care for the 3D thing very much.

19:01.756 --> 19:05.337
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was kind of a cheesy feature, but you can take it off and the game looks fine.

19:05.697 --> 19:09.558
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting because the way it works is that it doesn't ruin the visuals of the game.

19:09.578 --> 19:12.778
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know how much I'd actually use this, the 3D goggle thing.

19:12.918 --> 19:14.199
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a throwaway feature to me.

19:14.339 --> 19:20.440
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of cool, but the other thing that I thought was funny, because this was in the Japanese version, they were talking about the sexy girls.

19:21.140 --> 19:22.800
[SPEAKER_04]: They do have a lot of sexy girls.

19:22.840 --> 19:26.841
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I remember seeing a dump of this game online or whatever, and like

19:27.483 --> 19:28.604
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like country music and

19:51.956 --> 19:54.899
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have a very good experience with Curio Revolution.

19:55.120 --> 19:56.881
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very similar to KR Party.

19:58.082 --> 19:59.624
[SPEAKER_03]: It runs on almost the exact same interface.

19:59.644 --> 20:02.226
[SPEAKER_03]: What I thought was interesting is they've added some interesting eye toy features.

20:02.567 --> 20:04.849
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how in KR Party you could create a character?

20:05.805 --> 20:12.831
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also create a character in the country one, but you can take your own picture on the eye toy and have your face on the character, which I thought was very interesting.

20:13.331 --> 20:14.912
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can also do the eye toy thing.

20:14.952 --> 20:20.876
[SPEAKER_03]: Some backgrounds have big TV monitors, and it'll put you singing in your living room in the TV monitors.

20:21.777 --> 20:23.418
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cheesy, but it's cute.

20:23.478 --> 20:24.559
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it'll be fun.

20:24.819 --> 20:28.062
[SPEAKER_03]: For the party atmosphere of Karaoke Revolution, I think it's cute.

20:28.562 --> 20:37.249
[SPEAKER_03]: And whereas I probably won't buy this game because I'm not much of a country fan, I think it's good that they're opening this franchise up to a new audience.

20:38.229 --> 20:40.491
[SPEAKER_03]: And the partnership with CMT as well, smart move.

20:41.912 --> 20:46.876
[SPEAKER_03]: And for my limited knowledge of country songs, it's a pretty good mix.

20:48.283 --> 20:49.364
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Yu-Gi-Oh!

20:49.545 --> 20:50.205
[SPEAKER_03]: USB.

20:50.786 --> 20:52.148
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little Yu-Gi-Oh!

20:52.168 --> 20:54.610
[SPEAKER_03]: game you can put on, or it's Yu-Gi-Oh!

20:54.630 --> 20:58.715
[SPEAKER_03]: that's already on the USB and you can basically take it anywhere with you, plug it into the computer and go.

20:58.955 --> 21:01.498
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an innovation thing, but, I mean, Yu-Gi-Oh!

21:01.558 --> 21:02.239
[SPEAKER_03]: is great.

21:02.920 --> 21:06.464
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was quite interesting how they wanted to explain how it worked.

21:06.604 --> 21:08.526
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I think we get it, you know.

21:10.686 --> 21:12.691
[SPEAKER_03]: How about DDR Supernova?

21:12.811 --> 21:13.813
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I didn't play that at all.

21:14.936 --> 21:19.146
[SPEAKER_04]: I was the first person in the United States outside of Konami to play the game.

21:20.540 --> 21:21.781
[SPEAKER_04]: You're staking that claim right there?

21:21.801 --> 21:22.701
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm staking that claim.

21:23.601 --> 21:30.325
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe I was number four in the play on that machine, besides Jason Enos and two other Konami employees that were testing it out.

21:30.825 --> 21:33.126
[SPEAKER_04]: I was on that game almost all day.

21:33.886 --> 21:34.807
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great.

21:34.887 --> 21:35.307
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.

21:35.587 --> 21:42.070
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really out of shape, though, and my only complaint is Fascination Max.

21:42.190 --> 21:43.771
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a dumb-sounding song.

21:44.230 --> 21:45.153
[SPEAKER_04]: The bonus stage.

21:45.333 --> 21:52.631
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the bonus stage to the boss song or whatever, it sounds like a really crappy fan mix and the steps, it reminds me of a really bad sim file.

21:53.052 --> 22:21.044
[SPEAKER_04]: that's it's really sad that that's you know because they could do so much better and I remember like you know Paranoia Respect that was a cool remix of Paranoia and it sounded cool and was hard but it's starting to get to the point now with Max you know you have Max period which was just bullshit as it was as a song and a remix and now this is just a step beyond that and it I don't know might some people like it because it's super hard I personally didn't care for it but you know what there's 350

22:22.106 --> 22:23.207
[SPEAKER_04]: Some songs in this thing.

22:23.587 --> 22:24.127
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares?

22:24.767 --> 22:26.188
[SPEAKER_03]: One song is not going to ruin it.

22:26.328 --> 22:26.728
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

22:27.309 --> 22:28.549
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a real good time playing it, too.

22:28.569 --> 22:39.234
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of repeats for me, but I understand that DDR, this is an early build, and I think a lot of folks on DDR Freak and stuff are running with this.

22:39.394 --> 22:43.696
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's still much more news to come on DDR Supernova.

22:43.996 --> 22:45.517
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just happy it's coming back to the arcades.

22:45.537 --> 22:45.657
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

22:45.657 --> 22:49.159
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to understand that the build that we played on was 50% done.

22:49.199 --> 22:52.802
[SPEAKER_04]: It had 230 songs on it right now, most of which were repeats.

22:52.862 --> 22:53.522
[SPEAKER_04]: But who cares?

22:54.283 --> 22:55.664
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just the old stuff.

22:55.804 --> 22:58.666
[SPEAKER_04]: That means 70 new songs that are going to be in there.

22:59.186 --> 23:02.728
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very curious to check out Battle Mode because that's something I've been bitching about.

23:02.748 --> 23:07.191
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs to be in an arcade DDR that's not Disney Mix for a long, long time.

23:07.231 --> 23:09.253
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm really excited to see the Battle Mode.

23:09.273 --> 23:14.016
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see what this is all about because I think DDR could be marketed as a very competitive game.

23:14.036 --> 23:15.317
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looks like it's kind of going that way

23:15.897 --> 23:16.958
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing the tournaments.

23:18.058 --> 23:19.259
[SPEAKER_04]: Worldwide tournament mode.

23:19.339 --> 23:24.081
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be released in all three regions, US, UK, and Japan.

23:25.362 --> 23:27.743
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going to be great also, the interface is really strange.

23:27.803 --> 23:29.524
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no more backgrounds to songs.

23:29.684 --> 23:31.925
[SPEAKER_04]: I've noticed no more background pictures.

23:31.985 --> 23:33.506
[SPEAKER_03]: I completely missed that.

23:33.626 --> 23:37.908
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all just normal video unless it actually has a video.

23:37.948 --> 23:40.850
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, it's got the 3D stage with the dancers and stuff.

23:40.870 --> 23:42.551
[SPEAKER_03]: That could be something that's still being worked on too.

23:42.591 --> 23:42.931
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know.

23:43.411 --> 23:44.492
[SPEAKER_04]: subsistence subsistence subsistence

24:12.671 --> 24:13.512
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking of something else.

24:34.591 --> 24:39.612
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you hear, though, that Naoki and Taka actually went down from Gamers Day to the location test?

24:39.692 --> 24:40.272
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I saw that.

24:40.392 --> 24:41.212
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, very interesting.

24:41.272 --> 24:43.833
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was kind of funny, the whole story with Naoki.

24:44.133 --> 24:47.233
[SPEAKER_04]: He was there taking pictures of the machine and people playing and stuff.

24:47.653 --> 24:49.394
[SPEAKER_04]: He was kind of running around like a little girl.

24:49.414 --> 24:50.174
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of funny.

24:51.394 --> 24:54.935
[SPEAKER_04]: Just watching them so excited about everything.

24:55.315 --> 24:55.815
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great.

24:57.775 --> 25:00.576
[SPEAKER_04]: We got some cool gifts and stuff.

25:01.796 --> 25:02.116
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

25:02.644 --> 25:05.950
[SPEAKER_04]: New songs, interesting to say the least.

25:06.411 --> 25:07.734
[SPEAKER_04]: Not too impressed with some of them.

25:09.277 --> 25:12.744
[SPEAKER_04]: I could care for a little bit less toxic being in...

25:15.658 --> 25:17.759
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that reminds me, Toxic in Beatmania.

25:18.759 --> 25:25.822
[SPEAKER_04]: I like what they did with the videos in the background, because it kind of reminded me of new videos for the songs, which are pretty cool.

25:25.942 --> 25:28.383
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you notice, though, in some of the videos, they didn't bother changing them?

25:28.443 --> 25:32.444
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, colors, it still says 2DX6 style in the corner in the video.

25:32.484 --> 25:33.305
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't bother taking that out.

25:33.325 --> 25:33.845
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll probably change.

25:34.285 --> 25:36.067
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know, because it looked like a finished build to me.

25:36.127 --> 25:42.073
[SPEAKER_03]: And I noticed this when Taka was playing against the Konami employee, Ferrari, when they were battling each other.

25:42.093 --> 25:43.674
[SPEAKER_03]: Ferrari won, by the way, and Taka failed the song.

25:43.934 --> 25:47.858
[SPEAKER_03]: They were playing colors, and they had a little Six Style logo in the corner.

25:47.898 --> 25:50.060
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed that, and it looked like a final build of the game to me.

25:50.080 --> 25:52.883
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this thing's coming out pretty soon, so I think they just didn't bother changing it.

25:52.943 --> 25:54.064
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, who cares?

25:54.144 --> 25:56.226
[SPEAKER_03]: It hasn't gotten gold yet, though, so I think it's fine.

25:56.386 --> 25:56.947
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see, we'll see.

25:57.447 --> 26:01.030
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you want to say about Konami Gamers Day?

26:01.070 --> 26:02.391
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really glad to have gone.

26:02.992 --> 26:05.734
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish they had shown more stuff that's coming out.

26:06.272 --> 26:06.592
[SPEAKER_04]: Namco Namco

26:34.947 --> 26:35.548
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, anyway.

26:36.649 --> 26:45.539
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, speaking of Jamie, Jamie, since she unfortunately was not able to go to Gamers Day, she was at school and at work, and she was also...

26:46.041 --> 26:46.701
[SPEAKER_08]: I was painting.

26:47.081 --> 26:48.261
[SPEAKER_03]: Painting and reading your letters.

26:48.781 --> 26:52.182
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I was also reading letters while I was supposed to be at school.

26:52.382 --> 26:59.883
[SPEAKER_03]: So, when you guys send in your emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, DarkSakura reads them and throws them away.

27:00.003 --> 27:00.804
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I laugh at them.

27:01.004 --> 27:01.604
[SPEAKER_03]: No, just kidding.

27:02.044 --> 27:06.905
[SPEAKER_03]: She brings them Sunday nights to the show with her to read them live on air, at least some select pieces.

27:06.965 --> 27:10.905
[SPEAKER_03]: So DarkSakura, reach into that mailbag and tell us who wrote us this week.

27:11.745 --> 27:15.086
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, just to go ahead and make a quick statement, I am going to be...

27:16.039 --> 27:23.423
[SPEAKER_08]: Limiting some of my letters to maybe about the top, I'd say, six letters that I receive.

27:24.203 --> 27:27.185
[SPEAKER_08]: So these are tonight's grouping.

27:27.965 --> 27:28.866
[SPEAKER_08]: These are the lucky few.

27:30.106 --> 27:35.229
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to start off with a letter from Simmel, who's one of our UK listeners.

27:36.690 --> 27:40.872
[SPEAKER_08]: Says, to let you know, in the UK we have Go Sudoku for PSP.

27:41.252 --> 27:42.993
[SPEAKER_08]: It's multiplayer and downloadable puzzles.

27:43.033 --> 27:43.914
[SPEAKER_08]: Best of all, it's only 20 pounds.

27:45.162 --> 27:49.123
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, we were talking about Sudoku last week, so I guess they already have a version of it over there in the UK.

27:49.363 --> 27:51.744
[SPEAKER_03]: They probably have a cheap one here, I just don't know of it.

27:51.764 --> 27:56.325
[SPEAKER_08]: On average, though, PSP games in the UK are anywhere between 35 to 40 pounds.

27:56.985 --> 27:58.865
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's actually a really good price.

27:59.926 --> 28:02.166
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder how that compares to how much those books cost.

28:02.866 --> 28:04.587
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd rather have a PSP game before I have a book.

28:04.607 --> 28:07.307
[SPEAKER_08]: It'd be about like us buying a PSP game for 35 bucks.

28:07.507 --> 28:13.509
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't see myself buying Sudoku on any system when a god like Tetris is right around the corner for DS, you know?

28:13.689 --> 28:14.089
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just me.

28:14.389 --> 28:18.753
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'd also like to say that he enjoys listening to the new format and likes how the show's progressing.

28:18.954 --> 28:19.194
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

28:19.214 --> 28:19.835
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you.

28:21.556 --> 28:28.964
[SPEAKER_08]: Another letter comes from DJ Ratchet, who's one of our newer people on the forums, too.

28:29.945 --> 28:31.887
[SPEAKER_08]: He wants to say that he loves the podcast.

28:32.107 --> 28:32.447
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

28:33.028 --> 28:38.093
[SPEAKER_08]: And has questions about Kingdom Hearts 2, estimated release date in the U.S., and if there's really a Tron level.

28:39.187 --> 28:40.388
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, there's a Tron level.

28:41.008 --> 28:43.690
[SPEAKER_08]: I do have a friend who owns the Japanese release.

28:44.270 --> 28:47.312
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm supposed to be obtaining it shortly myself.

28:49.613 --> 28:52.995
[SPEAKER_08]: And from what I understand, you know, I actually did have the release date.

28:53.035 --> 28:54.436
[SPEAKER_08]: I do believe it's the end of March.

28:55.676 --> 28:55.756
[SPEAKER_04]: 31st.

28:55.836 --> 28:57.457
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, it was 29th to the 31st.

28:57.477 --> 28:57.938
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's 31st now.

28:58.877 --> 28:59.057
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

29:00.038 --> 29:02.680
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I got my date through my resource, too.

29:03.520 --> 29:05.261
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's a good day lining up.

29:05.301 --> 29:05.822
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good sign.

29:05.842 --> 29:06.622
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, mine's pre-ordered.

29:06.662 --> 29:07.643
[SPEAKER_08]: Mine's pre-ordered already.

29:07.743 --> 29:14.568
[SPEAKER_08]: But not only is there a Tron level, there's also a Steamboat Willie level, which is so adorable.

29:14.708 --> 29:24.635
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I think that they're getting into the whole music game thing because the entire Undersea level is like big old Horkin music game.

29:25.666 --> 29:26.606
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting, alright.

29:26.626 --> 29:27.707
[SPEAKER_08]: A whole new world?

29:43.954 --> 29:45.496
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's in Aladdin.

29:46.136 --> 29:47.357
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't ask me, okay?

29:47.577 --> 29:50.200
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's just hilarious.

29:50.320 --> 29:51.181
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of their world?

29:51.221 --> 29:52.001
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of your world.

29:52.121 --> 29:52.842
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that it?

29:52.862 --> 29:54.003
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I'm close.

29:54.383 --> 29:57.486
[SPEAKER_03]: Every Disney song has something about, I want to be accepted by the world.

29:57.867 --> 29:59.768
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an outcast and I want to be loved.

30:00.769 --> 30:02.110
[SPEAKER_08]: I suck emo.

30:02.491 --> 30:04.212
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to be accepted by Blizzard.

30:04.252 --> 30:05.934
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to be loved in World of Warcraft.

30:06.134 --> 30:08.036
[SPEAKER_08]: For the record, there is a sixth emo ranger now.

30:08.499 --> 30:11.222
[SPEAKER_08]: Jack Thompson Let's Have Tea has emailed us

30:25.967 --> 30:27.068
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that nickname.

30:27.108 --> 30:27.548
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.

30:27.668 --> 30:31.392
[SPEAKER_03]: Our listeners and emailers have the best nicknames in the world.

30:31.412 --> 30:34.496
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we had Pooface made a comment in the first hour of the show.

30:34.836 --> 30:35.797
[SPEAKER_03]: We had Let's Have Tea.

30:35.997 --> 30:36.918
[SPEAKER_08]: Pooface is awesome.

30:37.038 --> 30:37.359
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

30:37.979 --> 30:39.922
[SPEAKER_08]: But every time I see Xander, I think of Buffy.

30:40.923 --> 30:42.004
[SPEAKER_03]: I think of Drawn Together.

30:43.612 --> 30:45.493
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on a never ending quest to save my girlfriend

31:05.723 --> 31:06.624
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a light in my dark soul

31:33.578 --> 31:36.404
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, you had me on musicals, so forget it.

31:36.444 --> 31:36.784
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

31:37.005 --> 31:44.219
[SPEAKER_08]: Pendragon writes in and says, this is support for Loki's whole PC fetish.

31:45.106 --> 31:46.347
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we have a Loki supporter!

31:47.787 --> 31:48.988
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to admit, it's about time.

31:49.528 --> 31:53.210
[SPEAKER_03]: We've heard the anti end of it, so now we need to hear the pro end of it.

31:53.230 --> 31:53.630
[SPEAKER_03]: We're fair.

31:53.970 --> 31:55.931
[SPEAKER_03]: We're fair and balanced radio.

31:56.472 --> 31:58.853
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not what it looks like, but how it actually works and performs.

31:58.893 --> 32:00.153
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see about the new Intel Macs.

32:00.193 --> 32:05.316
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, this pretty interface will bug the system down and overall will not be as fast as the PC.

32:05.336 --> 32:07.277
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a 3D graphic artist and I wouldn't bother with the Mac.

32:07.737 --> 32:08.598
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to know what?

32:08.998 --> 32:16.063
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, you're obviously not a professional graphic artist because just about any professional will use a Mac.

32:16.683 --> 32:22.708
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Intel Macs are clocked to be much faster than their equivalent PC.

32:25.025 --> 32:25.925
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is why I'm getting one.

32:27.206 --> 32:29.347
[SPEAKER_03]: This PC Mac thing is so 2005.

32:29.988 --> 32:30.948
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm done.

32:31.068 --> 32:31.389
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm done.

32:31.789 --> 32:33.410
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop sending emails on it.

32:33.530 --> 32:34.130
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

32:34.150 --> 32:41.795
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't wait until I get started broadcasting from my Mac because now the new iLife 6 has instant podcast support.

32:42.035 --> 32:43.556
[SPEAKER_04]: Will you be broadcasting in flavors?

32:44.637 --> 32:45.417
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I will have.

32:45.437 --> 32:47.779
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop egging this whole thing off.

32:47.979 --> 32:49.119
[SPEAKER_03]: Just sit down and shut up.

32:49.160 --> 32:51.121
[SPEAKER_08]: My show tastes like purple.

32:51.912 --> 32:52.593
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on.

32:52.633 --> 32:53.273
[SPEAKER_03]: Next email.

32:53.433 --> 32:56.416
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to do a podcast in a black like my soul flavor.

32:57.617 --> 32:58.658
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

32:58.798 --> 33:04.302
[SPEAKER_08]: Raphael writes in and says, I'm going to try not to rant about this, but here we go.

33:04.522 --> 33:06.244
[SPEAKER_08]: Usually that means there's a rant following.

33:07.064 --> 33:12.028
[SPEAKER_08]: The one thing that I find very amusing is that religious people say how bad and evil video games are.

33:12.129 --> 33:17.133
[SPEAKER_08]: However, they had even taken the smallest amount of time to read summaries of the game.

33:17.153 --> 33:18.414
[SPEAKER_08]: They would realize that the most...

33:19.554 --> 33:23.978
[SPEAKER_08]: games promote some of their morals, such as friendship, love, peace, tolerance, etc.

33:25.078 --> 33:31.263
[SPEAKER_08]: It just proves that most of the religious people in the media have blind, ignorant hate, which true Christians would frown upon.

33:31.784 --> 33:38.009
[SPEAKER_08]: However, I would like to note that not all Christians are like this, and not all video games deserve to be defended, such as games with blood, gore, dot dot dot.

33:39.029 --> 33:44.754
[SPEAKER_08]: Though this is only my personal view, as I would rather play Animal Crossing than shoot someone and laugh as their stomach explode.

33:45.359 --> 33:54.745
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, again, I have a problem, and I'm sure the emailer didn't intend to do this, but I have a problem with the generalization of religious people, because you can be religious and not be a moron.

33:55.145 --> 33:56.146
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easily possible.

33:56.166 --> 33:57.186
[SPEAKER_03]: I have many... I know.

33:57.206 --> 33:57.707
[SPEAKER_03]: You just said that.

33:57.807 --> 34:02.069
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, but I just wanted to clarify as well, but, you know.

34:05.432 --> 34:05.932
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, moving on.

34:06.172 --> 34:06.692
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on.

34:07.273 --> 34:09.174
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, I was taking a moment to savor my caffeine.

34:09.699 --> 34:10.740
[SPEAKER_03]: I do appreciate the perspective, though.

34:10.760 --> 34:10.980
[SPEAKER_03]: He's right.

34:11.000 --> 34:16.285
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because it makes me think of something, and this has nothing to do with games but TV, so DarkSakura, just tune out for a minute.

34:17.146 --> 34:29.376
[SPEAKER_03]: There was this show on TV recently called Book of Daniel on NBC, and it got this huge flack from, you know, just the bad apples of the religious world that said, you know, it's sacrilegious, da-da-da.

34:29.897 --> 34:34.120
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you actually took time to watch the show, you'd see that it actually portrayed the...

34:37.543 --> 34:38.824
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

35:07.515 --> 35:11.319
[SPEAKER_08]: Just goes to show it's the blind leading the, you know, brainless and blind.

35:13.240 --> 35:17.764
[SPEAKER_08]: I got an email from one of our listeners, SithSpawn.

35:20.407 --> 35:21.928
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, three bits to bring up.

35:21.988 --> 35:26.072
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go ahead and I'll paraphrase this a little bit, but I'll go ahead and read some of it.

35:26.712 --> 35:31.617
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting bit number one, you can now listen to OLR and the other podcasts if you have a TiVo and broadband connection.

35:32.412 --> 35:34.033
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard about TiVo Podcast.

35:34.053 --> 35:35.033
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so awesome.

35:35.053 --> 35:37.414
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to see our show on TiVo.

35:37.755 --> 35:39.615
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a picture of your TV and send it.

35:39.656 --> 35:48.240
[SPEAKER_08]: The article is located at publications.mediapost.com The URL is really long, so I'll just say look for it there.

35:49.960 --> 35:51.861
[SPEAKER_08]: He set OLR up and works great.

35:51.901 --> 35:54.343
[SPEAKER_08]: He even displays our logo on the TV.

35:55.343 --> 35:55.723
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet.

35:55.763 --> 35:56.263
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

35:57.004 --> 35:57.504
[SPEAKER_03]: Send us a picture.

35:57.524 --> 35:57.984
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see that.

35:58.044 --> 35:59.305
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I would really like to see a picture of that.

36:00.131 --> 36:01.997
[SPEAKER_03]: I have TiVo knockoff on my TV.

36:02.017 --> 36:03.522
[SPEAKER_03]: I have Comcast, not TiVo.

36:05.026 --> 36:12.629
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting bit number two, not sure if you mentioned this yet, recently PC Gamer announced that they will no longer use advertisements for items and gold farming services.

36:13.869 --> 36:17.731
[SPEAKER_08]: The article is at www.next-gen.biz.

36:19.251 --> 36:23.273
[SPEAKER_08]: Gamers that play MMOs just want to know what we think about that.

36:23.553 --> 36:33.577
[SPEAKER_08]: He says his opinion is that this is a great idea, not so much because it will put farmers out of business, but because it's a big statement that gamers are getting really sick of these game-ruining services.

36:34.840 --> 36:39.402
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard about it, and I think we were considering it for inclusion in previous podcasts, but we were out of time.

36:39.922 --> 36:47.345
[SPEAKER_03]: And I support the move, you know, and I don't know.

36:47.365 --> 36:48.366
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's all I really have to say.

36:49.659 --> 36:56.420
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also, um, the last thing is that last week I got an email from Sony asking me to participate in a PSP beta for Siphon Filter Dark Mirror.

36:56.940 --> 36:59.761
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, go to a site, fill out a form, and they mail you a UMD.

36:59.861 --> 37:00.281
[SPEAKER_08]: The catch?

37:00.321 --> 37:03.262
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to sign up using the PSP browser and you need the newest firmware, 2.6.

37:03.742 --> 37:10.223
[SPEAKER_08]: I hit up the site about 10 hours after I got the email and quickly got a message saying they already had all the beta participants they needed.

37:10.603 --> 37:14.024
[SPEAKER_08]: The beta is full less than a day after the email, WTF.

37:14.244 --> 37:16.104
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple things to touch on that.

37:16.364 --> 37:18.085
[SPEAKER_04]: One, you didn't need the 2.6 firmware.

37:18.125 --> 37:19.625
[SPEAKER_04]: You could spoof it and it's no problem.

37:19.945 --> 37:24.046
[SPEAKER_04]: Two, it's not going to really matter anymore, which we'll cover later.

37:24.946 --> 37:25.247
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

37:25.787 --> 37:33.228
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, what he thinks about that is it was a very limited beta, knowing that thousands of gamers would try to update their PSP to 2.6 to sign up.

37:33.308 --> 37:35.429
[SPEAKER_02]: For a siphon filter game?

37:36.604 --> 37:37.245
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot.

37:37.265 --> 37:47.839
[SPEAKER_04]: There was also another beta that's going on right now actually for Pursuit Force, which is going out to also people that are members of the PlayStation.com.

37:48.600 --> 37:49.521
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, they select...

37:50.157 --> 37:51.378
[SPEAKER_04]: A few of them that participate.

37:53.540 --> 37:55.882
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other emails?

37:56.122 --> 37:58.624
[SPEAKER_08]: There is actually one more just because it needs to be said.

37:58.904 --> 38:12.615
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, I do want to go in and thank Rob Way for the article about the game writing from the first half of the show because he's the one who gave me that little bit of knowledge.

38:15.939 --> 38:24.008
[SPEAKER_08]: One of our writers, John Blanco, said that he didn't get bored of Nintendogs, just recently acquired 50,000 trainer points.

38:24.609 --> 38:27.613
[SPEAKER_08]: All dogs and interior decorations are now unlocked.

38:28.093 --> 38:29.074
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a quote.

38:33.220 --> 38:34.581
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, go on with your bad self.

38:35.102 --> 38:35.722
[SPEAKER_08]: You rock.

38:35.842 --> 38:36.803
[SPEAKER_02]: And your bad game.

38:37.644 --> 38:40.006
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I liked the puppies, okay?

38:40.126 --> 38:41.628
[SPEAKER_03]: Weren't you not here, Miklatov?

38:41.788 --> 38:42.669
[SPEAKER_03]: When did you come back?

38:42.769 --> 38:43.910
[SPEAKER_03]: You just appeared suddenly.

38:44.030 --> 38:45.751
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I appeared suddenly with Starbucks.

38:45.771 --> 38:46.532
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, that's right.

38:46.572 --> 38:47.673
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how the coffee got my hand.

38:47.973 --> 38:49.014
[SPEAKER_08]: He appeared with crack.

38:49.154 --> 38:49.615
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

38:49.875 --> 38:50.736
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

38:50.776 --> 38:51.757
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm almost out.

38:51.977 --> 38:53.779
[SPEAKER_08]: We remember what Thomi has to say about this.

38:54.279 --> 38:58.443
[SPEAKER_04]: Taco is into the to-be-sold pile for GameStop right now.

39:00.266 --> 39:06.289
[SPEAKER_08]: So is Ayn Menchie and my Dalmatian, who I forgot what I named.

39:07.389 --> 39:07.810
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

39:08.230 --> 39:08.970
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's it for the emails?

39:10.111 --> 39:10.291
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

39:10.531 --> 39:19.156
[SPEAKER_03]: Send your emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and we definitely read them all, try to respond to them all, and read as many as we can in any given week.

39:19.396 --> 39:20.336
[SPEAKER_03]: So we love getting emails.

39:20.356 --> 39:21.097
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got a ton.

39:21.197 --> 39:23.078
[SPEAKER_03]: It inflates our egos and makes us feel loved.

39:23.458 --> 39:24.839
[SPEAKER_08]: I will take the top six.

39:25.489 --> 39:26.630
[SPEAKER_03]: Metal Gear Solid

39:50.545 --> 39:51.546
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's always good.

39:52.006 --> 39:54.007
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, look, I'm super busy right now.

39:54.388 --> 39:58.731
[SPEAKER_04]: I can only do three movies in two years.

39:59.271 --> 40:03.113
[SPEAKER_04]: So early I said I could do Hitman or Metal Gear Solid B Fall of 2007.

40:04.054 --> 40:06.676
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that they would give you the rights to it anyways, you jackass.

40:06.956 --> 40:18.984
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, he's not doing it, and his next piece of crap that's coming out is in the name of the king, Dungeon Seas movie, better known as We Ripped Off, Lord of the Rings for the entire thing, and it sucks.

40:19.738 --> 40:21.620
[SPEAKER_04]: Look for that coming in November.

40:22.241 --> 40:23.502
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, in two parts, by the way.

40:25.244 --> 40:28.447
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and what's he made on BloodRayne so far?

40:28.868 --> 40:30.109
[SPEAKER_04]: Not jack shit.

40:30.129 --> 40:30.810
[SPEAKER_03]: $20, maybe?

40:30.830 --> 40:33.833
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, hopefully these studios will learn.

40:35.728 --> 40:36.449
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR West Virginia

41:00.532 --> 41:02.835
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knew that West Virginia still made the news once in a while?

41:02.875 --> 41:03.656
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm teasing, I'm teasing.

41:04.216 --> 41:14.729
[SPEAKER_03]: West Virginia actually, they had a partnership with Konami to put Dance Dance Revolution in 753 public schools.

41:14.769 --> 41:17.472
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be all of them within the next three years.

41:17.632 --> 41:19.755
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a pilot project that started last spring.

41:20.163 --> 41:22.444
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're actually going to incorporate it into schools.

41:22.905 --> 41:23.925
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's kind of interesting.

41:24.946 --> 41:29.848
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's being helped, funded by Konami, as well as all the usual grants and stuff.

41:29.928 --> 41:31.209
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're playing Ultra Mix.

41:31.549 --> 41:33.050
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know which one, but I know they're doing Ultra Mix.

41:33.070 --> 41:38.353
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, in the little clip here, you can see on Yahoo News where I pulled it from.

41:38.453 --> 41:40.394
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, this particular one, they're playing Extreme.

41:40.614 --> 41:44.777
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's a lie when they actually play it, because it's Ultra Mix.

41:45.877 --> 41:46.218
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

41:46.858 --> 41:47.258
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

41:47.659 --> 41:48.700
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are they doing this here?

41:49.380 --> 41:59.509
[SPEAKER_03]: Health Promotions Manager Nydia Henderson, Manager for the Public Employees Insurance Program, says, One out of three children born in West Virginia today will have diabetes by the time they grow up.

41:59.569 --> 42:02.552
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a devastating statistic and not acceptable.

42:02.632 --> 42:07.657
[SPEAKER_03]: So essentially they're trying to make fitness fun and get kids into it via DDR, which I think is pretty awesome.

42:08.457 --> 42:11.240
[SPEAKER_03]: And to make people not afraid of West Virginia.

42:11.260 --> 42:11.340
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

42:12.014 --> 42:16.277
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember what I said earlier about obesity being basically pandemic.

42:17.518 --> 42:19.899
[SPEAKER_08]: I applaud their efforts in trying to get kids active.

42:20.520 --> 42:24.983
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to be a little bit of a fly on the wall at Konami's Gamer Day, and I picked up a little interesting tidbit.

42:25.063 --> 42:28.045
[SPEAKER_03]: All I can say is, this won't be the last of it that you hear.

42:28.265 --> 42:28.985
[SPEAKER_03]: This won't be the last of it.

42:29.005 --> 42:34.869
[SPEAKER_08]: You know a lot of independent schools in California are doing the same, just on their own, just buying the machine and making it part of their gym program.

42:35.189 --> 42:37.391
[SPEAKER_02]: Why can't I know this stuff and I work for Konami?

42:37.411 --> 42:37.491
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

42:38.629 --> 42:39.129
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

42:52.503 --> 42:53.604
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the important part.

43:14.286 --> 43:14.406
[SPEAKER_04]: Chuu!

43:14.426 --> 43:14.606
[SPEAKER_04]: Chuu!

43:14.626 --> 43:14.706
[SPEAKER_04]: Chuu!

43:38.200 --> 43:43.124
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so it includes, you know, they have different things.

43:43.244 --> 43:55.214
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also kind of got a little bit of Ode to Jam type of feel to it where you can, you know, soup up your avatars with different items that you win by earning credits and stuff and learn new moves, songs, etc.

43:55.974 --> 43:59.077
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to check this out, they're actually doing a free beta on it right now.

43:59.377 --> 44:03.160
[SPEAKER_03]: It's au.bugsgames.net.

44:03.640 --> 44:06.583
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say that was headlined on our site earlier this week, so it should have a link there too.

44:07.523 --> 44:08.326
[SPEAKER_03]: OrangeLandsRadio.com.

44:08.787 --> 44:09.469
[SPEAKER_03]: Much easier to remember.

44:11.095 --> 44:11.495
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

44:12.635 --> 44:15.136
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, audition something that can be played worldwide, yes?

44:15.436 --> 44:15.716
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

44:15.796 --> 44:18.317
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would include our friends in the UK.

44:18.397 --> 44:25.519
[SPEAKER_04]: However, you do want to have Internet Explorer for signing up on the site and everything because it only works in Internet Explorer.

44:25.579 --> 44:26.599
[SPEAKER_04]: Worst game ever.

44:26.819 --> 44:28.059
[SPEAKER_04]: No love for Firefox.

44:28.079 --> 44:28.820
[SPEAKER_03]: Worst game ever.

44:29.520 --> 44:29.800
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

44:29.840 --> 44:33.141
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I was trying to do a segue into the UK news that you completely interrupted.

44:33.221 --> 44:33.901
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

44:34.021 --> 44:36.122
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, my segue is ruined.

44:36.222 --> 44:36.602
[SPEAKER_03]: UK news.

44:36.822 --> 44:37.402
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up in the UK?

44:38.004 --> 44:38.645
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of stuff.

44:39.686 --> 44:48.374
[SPEAKER_08]: First off, there is a Crash Day demo from Atari put out for PC, PS2, and Xbox.

44:49.475 --> 44:53.058
[SPEAKER_08]: And the download is actually up on Eurogamer.

44:53.439 --> 44:56.061
[SPEAKER_08]: If you go to their homepage, there's a link to the demo.

44:56.802 --> 44:57.583
[SPEAKER_08]: I love Eurogamer.

44:59.609 --> 45:09.278
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, the game is a combination of racing, stunts, and big ol' weapons, so you can make big smashy messes and design your own tracks.

45:09.879 --> 45:16.445
[SPEAKER_08]: Demo includes a wrecking match event and a stunt show event, and you can even try out the multiplayer mode via either LAN or internet.

45:17.025 --> 45:20.729
[SPEAKER_08]: You can only launch the demo 50 times, though, so be warned.

45:21.069 --> 45:22.530
[SPEAKER_08]: The official release date is February 24th.

45:25.268 --> 45:30.610
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, for our listeners in Australia, we never forget you guys.

45:31.750 --> 45:33.371
[SPEAKER_08]: The Xbox 360 has been delayed.

45:33.651 --> 45:35.932
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some in chat right now, too.

45:36.352 --> 45:38.352
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got to be a crazy hour over there right now.

45:38.372 --> 45:40.093
[SPEAKER_08]: It's something in the morning, isn't it?

45:40.153 --> 45:42.674
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks to you early birds in Australia tuning in.

45:43.034 --> 45:43.334
[SPEAKER_03]: Love ya!

45:44.675 --> 45:45.895
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for hanging out with us.

45:48.077 --> 45:51.839
[SPEAKER_08]: The console was supposed to launch on March 2nd.

45:51.999 --> 45:54.841
[SPEAKER_08]: The date has been delayed to March 23rd.

45:55.422 --> 46:07.951
[SPEAKER_08]: Microsoft said that the slip-up was due to, and I quote, unprecedented global consumer demand and short-term manufacturing issues due to component shortages stemming from challenges in rampant supplies, meaning we screwed up.

46:09.362 --> 46:16.748
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, according to Microsoft, the launch date ensures that the markets will have an adequate supply of Xbox 360 consoles to meet demand at launch.

46:17.208 --> 46:19.610
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe they're trying to learn from their little mess up with us.

46:20.815 --> 46:25.456
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to clarify, Deekman, who's our friend down under in chat right now, says it's actually only 3 p.m.

46:25.496 --> 46:25.776
[SPEAKER_03]: over there.

46:26.116 --> 46:26.996
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's not too bad.

46:27.016 --> 46:28.577
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not bad.

46:29.577 --> 46:35.298
[SPEAKER_08]: They also, though, expect to sell between 4.5 million and 5.5 million units by July.

46:37.099 --> 46:43.540
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, there was the mention, too, that demand is completely overpowering supply everywhere.

46:44.400 --> 46:48.341
[SPEAKER_08]: Microsoft said that they've lowered their 90-day sales forecast.

46:49.867 --> 46:52.913
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, they got a little bit ahead of themselves, huh?

46:52.933 --> 46:54.856
[SPEAKER_02]: Does everywhere not include Japan anymore?

46:55.538 --> 46:56.359
[SPEAKER_02]: Japan, they've only sold 100,000.

46:58.263 --> 46:59.223
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's not surprising.

47:00.104 --> 47:05.526
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, you know, I'm sure people who know me know I have a lot of love for SNK.

47:06.186 --> 47:07.626
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a Neo Geo.

47:07.766 --> 47:10.387
[SPEAKER_08]: I have versions of King of Fighters 2000.

47:10.427 --> 47:12.648
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that you bought a Neo Geo is hardcore right there.

47:12.788 --> 47:15.549
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, my husband traded a Sega CD for it.

47:16.710 --> 47:18.390
[SPEAKER_08]: And now we have another Sega CD.

47:19.991 --> 47:21.291
[SPEAKER_08]: But this was a while back.

47:23.432 --> 47:23.512
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

47:25.840 --> 47:35.328
[SPEAKER_08]: Xbox is getting KOF Neowave, which is basically the same three-on-three fighting team.

47:35.728 --> 47:38.531
[SPEAKER_08]: You have 12 three-person teams.

47:39.211 --> 47:41.934
[SPEAKER_08]: Included are the women's teams with Mai, King, and Yuri.

47:42.995 --> 47:45.076
[SPEAKER_08]: The Fatal Fury team with Terry, Joe, and Andy.

47:45.297 --> 47:46.337
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got a tournament mode.

47:46.538 --> 47:49.260
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also three modes of play.

47:50.121 --> 47:51.302
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really get what these are.

47:51.342 --> 47:53.483
[SPEAKER_08]: There's Super Cancel, Guard Break, and Max 2.

47:54.444 --> 47:54.945
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me.

47:55.505 --> 47:59.850
[SPEAKER_08]: Plus a new heat mode that lets you power up attacks in exchange for gradual loss of health.

48:00.771 --> 48:03.474
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, there's screenshots up on Eurogamer, so you might want to check them out.

48:04.475 --> 48:11.842
[SPEAKER_04]: Also mention, if you are a King of Fighters fan, King of Fighters 94 Rebound came out a couple weeks ago, actually.

48:13.023 --> 48:13.924
[SPEAKER_04]: For the Xbox as well.

48:14.665 --> 48:15.586
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got KOF 95 on Saturn.

48:18.664 --> 48:22.785
[SPEAKER_08]: If you've got a US Saturn, you have to do this thing where you put in your loading cart.

48:22.925 --> 48:24.145
[SPEAKER_08]: Change it out and put in the RAM cart real quick.

48:24.585 --> 48:28.106
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the, I think, three Saturn games that runs on a RAM cart.

48:29.387 --> 48:31.727
[SPEAKER_08]: Half the game is on cartridge, which doesn't help the load time any anyway.

48:32.987 --> 48:33.988
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, release dates.

48:34.628 --> 48:36.288
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually have two sets of release dates.

48:36.728 --> 48:40.449
[SPEAKER_08]: We have our UK release dates and Australian release dates.

48:41.709 --> 48:44.430

[SPEAKER_08]: On Xbox 360, there is going to be the various Madden games, Need for Speed, Most Wanted, which I'm actually, that game's growing on me.

49:44.025 --> 49:44.526
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a good game.

49:45.106 --> 50:08.970
[SPEAKER_08]: Ridge Racer 6 of course now these are from what I'm seeing with these dates though I don't get why they're if the system's not being released until late March they're putting a February release date on them so PS2 um first February we've got World Series Poker Tied the Tasmanian Tiger um Sega Classic Collection on the 2nd February 6th We Love Katamari

[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

50:40.963 --> 50:41.443
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else?

50:42.824 --> 50:44.965
[SPEAKER_08]: And I won a winning lottery ticket.

50:46.526 --> 50:47.186
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't we all?

50:47.546 --> 50:48.727
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it matter if it's from the UK?

50:48.767 --> 50:49.927
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you win if you bought a lottery?

50:50.067 --> 50:50.507
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess you could.

50:51.368 --> 50:52.048
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like a job over there.

50:52.068 --> 50:53.069
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they even have the lottery over there?

50:53.089 --> 50:53.349
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

50:53.629 --> 50:53.849
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

50:53.869 --> 50:54.549
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, moving on.

50:55.550 --> 50:57.931
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go over to Loki, who has some news about the PSP.

50:58.669 --> 51:07.552
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, actually earlier I was going to cover that they had figured out how to load all homebrew for versions 2.01 and 2.5.

51:08.072 --> 51:15.875
[SPEAKER_04]: They were 90% done earlier today with getting 2.6 to work, and apparently while we were doing this show they already broke the news that they've

51:16.295 --> 51:18.215
[SPEAKER_04]: Crack, no, figured out for 2.6.

51:18.615 --> 51:23.116
[SPEAKER_04]: So now every version currently of the PSP can run homebrew.

51:23.977 --> 51:36.539
[SPEAKER_04]: Now these latest ones, everything from 2.01 up to 2.6 require Grand Theft Auto using it, the glitch or hack that was with the save files to load an e-boot loader.

51:37.059 --> 51:39.219
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of how everything is working right now.

51:39.399 --> 51:42.280
[SPEAKER_04]: Some programs are working, some aren't.

51:42.720 --> 51:49.303
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you don't have Grand Theft Auto and aren't planning to get one, you probably should think twice about upgrading to 2.6.

51:50.463 --> 51:56.446
[SPEAKER_04]: However, new games that are coming out right now will require you to upgrade to 2.5 at least.

51:56.726 --> 51:59.307
[SPEAKER_04]: And some I hear are actually 2.6 now.

51:59.447 --> 52:01.268
[SPEAKER_04]: So something to think about.

52:01.648 --> 52:04.169
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all late-breaking as we're taping right now.

52:04.389 --> 52:05.030
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, pretty much.

52:05.510 --> 52:08.191
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can find that stuff on PSP Updates.

52:08.670 --> 52:11.775
[SPEAKER_04]: Deekman pointed out that the 2.6 was done, so that was kind of cool.

52:12.416 --> 52:12.676
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

52:14.326 --> 52:16.748
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on, let's go to another topic here.

52:16.828 --> 52:18.629
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something completely different.

52:18.649 --> 52:25.113
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I like to browse the various gaming websites out there, kind of seeing what's popular, and one of them I scan on a regular basis is Joystick.

52:25.514 --> 52:35.620
[SPEAKER_03]: That's with a Q. Joystick had a story this week about a gallery of video game endings, and it's mostly for classic 8 and 16-bit game endings.

52:36.301 --> 52:37.181
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually check it out.

52:37.221 --> 52:42.665
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Video Game Museum at vgmuseum.com, and they mention in this story a lot of endings.

52:43.065 --> 52:44.106
[SPEAKER_03]: Sonic the Hedgehog,

52:44.606 --> 52:46.428
[SPEAKER_03]: What happens if you never were able to beat Strider?

52:47.308 --> 52:51.671
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, games that we all remember such as Metroid and things like that.

52:51.911 --> 52:54.173
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought I'd kind of bring that up here in studio.

52:54.633 --> 52:58.656
[SPEAKER_03]: What video game endings do you remember that are so memorable that you love?

52:59.436 --> 52:59.957
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura?

53:00.177 --> 53:04.099
[SPEAKER_08]: Ryu's ending on Super Street Fighter 2 with him just walking and the music playing.

53:05.460 --> 53:06.941
[SPEAKER_03]: Street Fighter 2 had some good endings, it did.

53:07.322 --> 53:09.003
[SPEAKER_03]: It was cool how every character kind of had a different one.

53:09.874 --> 53:11.935
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember how slow it was.

53:12.175 --> 53:14.557
[SPEAKER_08]: You know Street Fighter Alpha 2 came out on the Super Nintendo.

53:14.977 --> 53:16.838
[SPEAKER_08]: Only cartridge I had played with loading time.

53:17.138 --> 53:17.599
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me.

53:18.539 --> 53:21.100
[SPEAKER_08]: And the scenery would pop up.

53:21.221 --> 53:21.781
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, characters!

53:22.101 --> 53:23.382
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you kind of need them to play, don't you?

53:24.202 --> 53:31.106
[SPEAKER_08]: But I actually got my first screenshots from my old website, DarkSakura's Mostly Evil Shrine, from the Super Nintendo website.

53:31.126 --> 53:32.447
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I've been to that website.

53:33.297 --> 53:33.937
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it still up?

53:34.217 --> 53:34.817
[SPEAKER_08]: It's gone.

53:36.038 --> 53:37.758
[SPEAKER_08]: GeoCities finally deleted it.

53:37.778 --> 53:39.738
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to have a spin-off of Orange Jones Radio.

53:39.758 --> 53:40.699
[SPEAKER_08]: I've saved the pages.

53:40.739 --> 53:41.199
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

53:41.299 --> 53:42.599
[SPEAKER_03]: We should put it up for nostalgia value.

53:42.619 --> 53:43.959
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll put it up.

53:44.259 --> 53:45.880
[SPEAKER_08]: With its background midis and all.

53:47.100 --> 53:47.980
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was crappy.

53:48.140 --> 53:49.280
[SPEAKER_08]: But I hand-coded it.

53:49.901 --> 53:51.181
[SPEAKER_08]: I hand-coded my sites back then.

53:51.881 --> 53:52.681
[SPEAKER_03]: Other great endings.

53:52.781 --> 53:54.562
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, Miklatov, anything you want to add?

53:54.802 --> 53:56.982
[SPEAKER_03]: Personally, I liked the ending of Final Fantasy VIII.

53:58.282 --> 53:58.582
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

53:59.143 --> 54:00.183
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people didn't like that game.

54:00.503 --> 54:01.243
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was pretty good.

54:02.355 --> 54:04.176
[SPEAKER_08]: The ending was cool with selfie in the camera.

54:04.876 --> 54:05.896
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy IX, though.

54:06.356 --> 54:06.876
[SPEAKER_04]: That game sucked.

54:08.097 --> 54:08.457
[SPEAKER_04]: Megalov?

54:08.977 --> 54:09.557
[SPEAKER_02]: Silent Hill 2.

54:09.597 --> 54:12.398
[SPEAKER_02]: So sad and depressing.

54:12.438 --> 54:12.958
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved it.

54:13.778 --> 54:14.198
[SPEAKER_08]: Which ending?

54:14.859 --> 54:16.399
[SPEAKER_02]: The one I consider to be the true ending.

54:16.739 --> 54:17.539
[SPEAKER_02]: The dog ending, right?

54:18.059 --> 54:19.340
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the leave ending.

54:20.520 --> 54:21.000
[SPEAKER_02]: The one I saw?

54:22.220 --> 54:23.561
[SPEAKER_02]: With the letter at the end?

54:23.601 --> 54:23.821
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

54:23.881 --> 54:24.041
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

54:24.517 --> 54:27.558
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate myself and want to die one Strider I have actually beaten Strider

54:41.581 --> 54:42.121
[SPEAKER_03]: Hardcore.

54:42.281 --> 54:43.842
[SPEAKER_02]: Any given Mega Man game.

54:44.082 --> 54:44.462
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

54:44.762 --> 54:46.023
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially 2, I remember that.

54:47.003 --> 54:50.144
[SPEAKER_03]: Games I remember, especially from the 8-bit days, Super Mario Bros.

54:50.484 --> 54:53.445
[SPEAKER_03]: 2, the Dallas OMG It Was All a Dream thing.

54:54.625 --> 54:55.386
[SPEAKER_03]: Who can forget that one?

54:55.426 --> 54:56.126
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, Metroid.

54:56.466 --> 54:57.006
[SPEAKER_03]: Classic there.

54:57.566 --> 55:00.187
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think my favorite, though, would be Final Fantasy 4.

55:00.247 --> 55:02.348
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy 2 on Super Nintendo in the US.

55:02.868 --> 55:03.328
[SPEAKER_03]: Classic.

55:03.428 --> 55:04.029
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.

55:04.149 --> 55:04.749
[SPEAKER_03]: I loved it.

55:04.769 --> 55:06.189
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone, why are you shaking your head at that?

55:06.289 --> 55:06.770
[SPEAKER_03]: I loved it.

55:06.790 --> 55:09.671
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I just recently played it again on the Game Boy Advance.

55:10.631 --> 55:10.711
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh.

55:11.923 --> 55:11.983
[SPEAKER_02]: P.K.

55:12.003 --> 55:12.543
[SPEAKER_02]: Akira88 says Actraiser

55:29.523 --> 55:36.911
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100Mac, Chrono Trigger, VXChasenXV, Stop Spoiling Silent Hill 2 After you have become sufficient enough level where you do New Game+,

55:52.806 --> 56:07.001
[SPEAKER_08]: and you beat the game immediately upon setting on to the teleporter you get the designer ending where they each leave you a comment and one of the people you meet is Toriyama Wasn't one of the endings where the girls would rate the guys in the game?

56:08.446 --> 56:09.327
[SPEAKER_08]: Dark Knight, Shenmue

56:26.397 --> 56:27.658
[SPEAKER_03]: No, because it's a horrible game.

56:28.178 --> 56:30.660
[SPEAKER_03]: Pooface says Half-Life 2 because of the cliffhanger.

56:31.300 --> 56:32.201
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's see.

56:32.481 --> 56:35.223
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody said, oh, Pooface also said Halo 2 is the worst ending.

56:36.383 --> 56:38.465
[SPEAKER_03]: MiniMe283 says Zelda Ocarina of Time.

56:39.345 --> 56:40.626
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that had a good ending.

56:40.646 --> 56:41.086
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good ending.

56:41.106 --> 56:41.586
[SPEAKER_03]: Good stuff.

56:41.626 --> 56:42.267
[SPEAKER_03]: Good stuff, you guys.

56:42.787 --> 56:43.147
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

56:43.187 --> 56:44.348
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go ahead and move on.

56:44.388 --> 56:46.489
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, if you want to check out that website with Classic.

56:46.710 --> 56:49.731
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everything in there is considered Classic, so you may not find them all.

56:50.092 --> 56:52.933
[SPEAKER_03]: VGMuseum.com, though, for the Classic 8 and 16-bit ones.

56:52.953 --> 56:53.214
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

56:53.234 --> 56:54.154
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot one more.

56:54.254 --> 56:54.414
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

56:54.715 --> 56:55.375
[SPEAKER_08]: The Guardian Legends.

56:56.934 --> 56:57.354
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit, yeah.

56:57.754 --> 56:58.014
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

56:59.135 --> 57:01.295
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what's going on with Street Fighter?

57:01.315 --> 57:02.936
[SPEAKER_03]: We brought up Street Fighter in the ending stuff.

57:02.976 --> 57:04.476
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on with Street Fighter now?

57:04.656 --> 57:09.938
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, as you remember, Street Fighter had a collection for it.

57:09.978 --> 57:23.302
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they have the Street Fighter Alpha collection, which is going to feature all of the Street Fighter Alpha games, including Super Gem Fighter, which is going to be pretty sweet as well.

57:25.555 --> 57:35.238
[SPEAKER_04]: They're basically going to also have the survival mode as well as dramatic battle which allows two-on-one tag team matches.

57:36.879 --> 57:40.960
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe, I'm trying to remember if they added anything else in there.

57:41.360 --> 57:45.722
[SPEAKER_04]: I think overall though it's going to be a pretty cool collection of games.

57:46.022 --> 57:55.145
[SPEAKER_04]: They've also got I mentioned the Capcom Classic Collection coming out to the PSP pretty soon with

57:55.576 --> 57:56.658
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of cool games on there.

57:57.780 --> 58:00.504
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what you need to put on one of those anthologies?

58:00.604 --> 58:00.805
[SPEAKER_08]: Huh?

58:00.965 --> 58:01.546
[SPEAKER_08]: Cyberbots.

58:03.869 --> 58:04.811
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be interesting.

58:06.754 --> 58:08.577
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, what's going on with Splinter Cell, Loki?

58:10.242 --> 58:13.403
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Splinter Cell Essentials is still coming out in March.

58:14.684 --> 58:19.226
[SPEAKER_04]: However, Splinter Cell Double Agent is postponed to September.

58:20.326 --> 58:26.288
[SPEAKER_04]: Much like they did with Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, they're tweaking the game to make sure it's perfect.

58:26.989 --> 58:32.831
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're worried right now that the installed base of Xbox 360 owners might not be...

58:34.045 --> 58:34.485
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

58:51.994 --> 58:53.174
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

59:17.078 --> 59:18.539
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll this up, landlord.

59:18.879 --> 59:24.460
[SPEAKER_08]: They're custom checks that have, hello, I am a check, please cash me, LOL, Katamari, do your best.

59:25.060 --> 59:30.862
[SPEAKER_03]: So is this just somebody took, because they have these custom check making services, so somebody just created Katamari checks?

59:31.582 --> 59:32.482
[SPEAKER_08]: I suppose so.

59:33.562 --> 59:39.184
[SPEAKER_08]: It says on there, there's a quote that says, I designed them, when you spend money, people should feel happy and also super lucky.

59:39.624 --> 59:42.064
[SPEAKER_08]: It is the most important thing to be contributing to the success.

59:42.344 --> 59:44.185
[SPEAKER_08]: For every special day, do not chase waterfalls.

59:45.876 --> 59:49.300
[SPEAKER_03]: PK Akira88 in our chatroom says, now I can bounce a check in style.

59:50.401 --> 59:51.342
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

59:52.383 --> 59:54.386
[SPEAKER_08]: You can roll up overdraft fees too.

59:54.566 --> 59:56.108
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knew that Katamari's bounced?

59:58.726 --> 01:00:01.367
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we've just got a couple more stories left for you guys.

01:00:01.387 --> 01:00:05.247
[SPEAKER_03]: We are going to take just a couple quick Skype line calls right after this.

01:00:05.527 --> 01:00:09.088
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can call us on our Skype line, www.orangelunchradio.com.

01:00:09.108 --> 01:00:10.308
[SPEAKER_03]: Click on Interact With Us.

01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:13.349
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you can also call us over the regular telephone line.

01:00:13.389 --> 01:00:16.530
[SPEAKER_03]: However, please remember, it is not an 800 number.

01:00:16.650 --> 01:00:20.130
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're not the person that owns the phone line, you need to get somebody's permission before you call.

01:00:20.451 --> 01:00:20.871
[SPEAKER_03]: The number, 916-226-7000.

01:00:22.958 --> 01:00:25.659
[SPEAKER_03]: The Effects of Video Game Playtypes on Pain Threshold and Tolerance

01:00:47.921 --> 01:00:48.341
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

01:00:48.601 --> 01:00:52.003
[SPEAKER_03]: The study compared several different genres of games and their effects on pain.

01:00:52.283 --> 01:00:58.425
[SPEAKER_03]: They used action, puzzle, arcade, fighting sports, and boxing games, things that encourage high attention and stimulus.

01:00:59.366 --> 01:01:02.387
[SPEAKER_03]: The researchers also measured the emotional response to each type.

01:01:04.047 --> 01:01:16.351
[SPEAKER_03]: He concluded, Dr. Brian Radenbush, the director of undergraduate research, says, Physicians could possibly implement this in their office to aid in distraction during a painful procedure such as injection or dental work.

01:01:16.651 --> 01:01:21.392
[SPEAKER_03]: Video games could also be used in waiting rooms to distract patients from upcoming surgical procedures.

01:01:22.072 --> 01:01:30.404
[SPEAKER_03]: This principle, by the way, is one of the driving forces behind Child's Play, which we talked about earlier in the program, the drive to donate games to children's hospital wards.

01:01:31.185 --> 01:01:32.367
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting there.

01:01:33.388 --> 01:01:37.935
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm assuming that the Nintendo DS version of Under the Knife is not one of those games.

01:01:38.015 --> 01:01:39.217
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably not.

01:01:39.417 --> 01:01:39.958
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably not.

01:01:39.998 --> 01:01:40.519
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:42.022
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this legitimate?

01:01:42.543 --> 01:01:46.029
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard of this video games being used in dentist's office before to distract people.

01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.810
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a great idea.

01:01:46.850 --> 01:01:51.858
[SPEAKER_03]: My dentist has CNN and it's distracting enough, you know, to kind of keep my mind off of...

01:01:53.058 --> 01:01:53.838
[SPEAKER_08]: This isn't new.

01:01:54.439 --> 01:02:08.107
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember being about 13 years old, watching something on the news program where they were using light hypnosis to have people go into dental surgery without anesthesia.

01:02:09.788 --> 01:02:10.848
[SPEAKER_08]: They had like a track.

01:02:11.309 --> 01:02:17.212
[SPEAKER_08]: They were actually testing it out with little children, having them follow it and saying, hey, follow the rabbit with your eyes, see where it ends up.

01:02:17.572 --> 01:02:20.554
[SPEAKER_08]: By the time the light would hit the end of the track, their surgery should be done.

01:02:23.834 --> 01:02:29.276
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a few things to follow up with, a few more stories real quick.

01:02:29.796 --> 01:02:31.936
[SPEAKER_04]: Just mainly Xbox Live stuff right now.

01:02:32.216 --> 01:02:38.398
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be an update to the Xbox Live for Call of Duty 2.

01:02:38.438 --> 01:02:42.499
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to have a multiplayer update that's going to be happening, I think, Monday or Tuesday.

01:02:43.183 --> 01:02:50.587
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, there's going to be an update for the dashboard, which was going to add that feature for webcams and whatnot.

01:02:50.987 --> 01:02:52.908
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's going to be coming pretty soon here.

01:02:53.108 --> 01:02:57.311
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, last week, there was a couple things added to the Xbox Live Arcade.

01:02:57.851 --> 01:02:59.952
[SPEAKER_04]: Marble Blast Ultra, a brand new game coming out.

01:02:59.972 --> 01:03:01.813
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like your Marble Madness type of game.

01:03:02.433 --> 01:03:08.157
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, the demo for Full Auto hit last week.

01:03:08.237 --> 01:03:12.139
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you don't have that yet, you need to download it, because it's awesome.

01:03:12.719 --> 01:03:16.943
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's go over to the Skype line, see what you guys want to add tonight.

01:03:17.443 --> 01:03:26.290
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, remember, www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on Interact With Us, and you can get all the details on how to call us via the Skype line, such as this person's doing right now.

01:03:26.350 --> 01:03:27.651
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:03:28.212 --> 01:03:29.433
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, what's up?

01:03:29.553 --> 01:03:30.093
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, who's this?

01:03:30.113 --> 01:03:31.755
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Xander from Florida.

01:03:31.855 --> 01:03:35.798
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, Xander from Florida, who's on a never-ending quest to save his girlfriend, right?

01:03:37.222 --> 01:03:38.063
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just messing with you.

01:03:38.183 --> 01:03:38.584
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up?

01:03:40.205 --> 01:03:42.227
[SPEAKER_02]: You forgot to mention Ico on the game endings.

01:03:42.888 --> 01:03:43.309
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

01:03:43.349 --> 01:03:46.212
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw you guys shouting that in chat, and I totally forgot Ico.

01:03:46.272 --> 01:03:47.533
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, now you said it.

01:03:47.573 --> 01:03:48.354
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is, Ico.

01:03:48.474 --> 01:03:49.375
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, Ico.

01:03:49.695 --> 01:03:50.576
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that all you wanted to say?

01:03:54.781 --> 01:03:55.381
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

01:03:55.662 --> 01:03:56.903
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, what else do you want to say then?

01:03:56.943 --> 01:03:58.264
[SPEAKER_03]: We're running low on time.

01:03:58.304 --> 01:03:58.805
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind?

01:04:00.476 --> 01:04:08.822
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:04:30.526 --> 01:04:32.307
[SPEAKER_02]: But no ITGDDR.

01:04:34.629 --> 01:04:35.650
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Xander.

01:04:36.271 --> 01:04:38.332
[SPEAKER_03]: Xander, I'm letting you go because you're trying to start fights.

01:04:38.653 --> 01:04:39.213
[SPEAKER_03]: But have a good one.

01:04:39.233 --> 01:04:39.854
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for calling.

01:04:40.014 --> 01:04:40.834
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just joking around.

01:04:40.935 --> 01:04:41.435
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you are.

01:04:41.755 --> 01:04:42.376
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care, Xander.

01:04:43.136 --> 01:04:43.417
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

01:04:43.457 --> 01:04:46.879
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of which, Pump It Up Zero ships to the US Arcades February 1st.

01:04:46.979 --> 01:04:48.841
[SPEAKER_03]: Heck yeah, Dave and Busters have got to be there.

01:04:49.522 --> 01:04:51.023
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:04:52.435 --> 01:04:53.175
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what's up?

01:04:53.416 --> 01:04:54.176
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, who's this?

01:04:55.057 --> 01:04:55.577
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Hitstun.

01:04:55.877 --> 01:04:57.198
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Hitstun, what's on your mind?

01:04:58.018 --> 01:05:01.521
[SPEAKER_06]: First time caller, long time listener, radio, whatever.

01:05:02.841 --> 01:05:04.122
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I breaking up to you guys?

01:05:04.622 --> 01:05:07.464
[SPEAKER_03]: You are breaking up a little bit, but go ahead and get your question out and we'll answer it.

01:05:08.685 --> 01:05:16.890
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really questioning, I think I can explain this, video games, like, taking away the pain, like,

01:05:18.888 --> 01:05:22.390
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that article you guys are talking about on 1UP or whatever you found.

01:05:23.170 --> 01:05:33.755
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so when you're playing a video game, if you're focused enough on it, it has to be a certain type of video game in which you're constantly focused or else you're going to lose.

01:05:34.575 --> 01:05:37.936
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, something like WarioWare would be most effective for it.

01:05:38.277 --> 01:05:41.538
[SPEAKER_06]: The game completely changes every five seconds.

01:05:42.218 --> 01:05:44.379
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're not totally focused on it, you're going to die.

01:05:44.639 --> 01:05:46.000
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're focused on something else...

01:05:46.618 --> 01:05:49.939
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for the call.

01:05:50.059 --> 01:05:50.399
[SPEAKER_06]: Appreciate it.

01:06:06.063 --> 01:06:07.125
[SPEAKER_03]: What are they doing to me?

01:06:27.848 --> 01:06:30.629
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, thank you guys so much for your calls on Skype.

01:06:30.649 --> 01:06:31.709
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to keep it short tonight.

01:06:31.749 --> 01:06:35.010
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very, very sorry, but we are so out of time, you guys.

01:06:35.590 --> 01:06:37.870
[SPEAKER_03]: But we do have one more thing for you guys.

01:06:38.130 --> 01:06:41.151
[SPEAKER_03]: How could we forget our newest segment here on Orange Lounge Radio?

01:06:41.731 --> 01:06:43.832
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura's Website of the Week.

01:06:46.933 --> 01:06:48.933
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, what's the Website of the Week this week?

01:06:49.173 --> 01:06:51.074
[SPEAKER_08]: The Oregon Trail Online.

01:06:51.154 --> 01:06:51.494
[SPEAKER_03]: Rock.

01:06:51.654 --> 01:06:54.574
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wearing my You Have Died of Dysentery shirt right now.

01:06:54.654 --> 01:06:55.014
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw it.

01:06:55.074 --> 01:06:55.375
[SPEAKER_08]: It's cute.

01:06:55.475 --> 01:06:55.835
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cute.

01:06:58.052 --> 01:07:02.998
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to read the first paragraph of this page, Remember the old Oregon Trail you used to play as a kid?

01:07:03.218 --> 01:07:08.164
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we took the best part of the old Oregon Trail, the hunting, and turned it into the new age 3D hunting game.

01:07:09.145 --> 01:07:11.708
[SPEAKER_08]: Our game is packed with squirrels, deer, and buffalo.

01:07:12.229 --> 01:07:16.874
[SPEAKER_08]: The game contains changing scenery and moving clouds, and there's even a trade function so you can purchase more bullets.

01:07:17.786 --> 01:07:20.627
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, this was made with Macromedia Director 10.

01:07:21.467 --> 01:07:23.647
[SPEAKER_08]: The models were made using 3DS Max 5.1.

01:07:23.907 --> 01:07:25.428
[SPEAKER_08]: They actually put up all their stuff on there.

01:07:25.828 --> 01:07:27.388
[SPEAKER_08]: The textures were done in Photoshop 7.

01:07:28.669 --> 01:07:33.070
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I actually, I think it's pretty cool that they put up what they did behind us.

01:07:33.130 --> 01:07:34.990
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, you know, for fans of the game.

01:07:35.610 --> 01:07:38.631
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, I tried to play it and it was a little, eh, to me.

01:07:39.151 --> 01:07:45.334
[SPEAKER_08]: But I still think the concept is cool, and I'm glad that someone has recognized the importance of Oregon Trail to our gaming heritage.

01:07:46.235 --> 01:08:05.144
[SPEAKER_08]: This is located at, and I'm just going to read out the whole URL, woz.comtechlab.msu.edu slash courses slash 447SP04 slash Oregon Trail, all one word.

01:08:06.058 --> 01:08:09.199
[SPEAKER_03]: Post that in chat and post it on the forum so our listeners can find it immediately.

01:08:09.599 --> 01:08:10.019
[SPEAKER_03]: Super.

01:08:11.299 --> 01:08:11.799
[SPEAKER_03]: Good timing.

01:08:11.959 --> 01:08:13.260
[SPEAKER_03]: You timed that right at the end of the song.

01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:15.000
[SPEAKER_03]: That was great radio.

01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:15.840
[SPEAKER_03]: High five.

01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:16.780
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:18.201
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a radio loser.

01:08:18.221 --> 01:08:19.281
[SPEAKER_03]: We could do this for real.

01:08:19.361 --> 01:08:20.041
Rock.

01:08:21.341 --> 01:08:21.662
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:08:21.942 --> 01:08:22.322
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

01:08:22.342 --> 01:08:22.942
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the end of the show.

01:08:22.962 --> 01:08:23.542
[SPEAKER_03]: My gosh, you guys.

01:08:23.822 --> 01:08:26.062
[SPEAKER_03]: We did, I think, about three hours worth of show tonight.

01:08:26.082 --> 01:08:27.943
[SPEAKER_03]: Just under three hours worth of regular show.

01:08:29.763 --> 01:08:30.263
[SPEAKER_03]: Busy show.

01:08:30.323 --> 01:08:31.064
[SPEAKER_03]: Controversial show.

01:08:31.084 --> 01:08:31.544
[SPEAKER_03]: I need a cigarette.

01:08:31.604 --> 01:08:32.784
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get lots of emails.

01:08:33.693 --> 01:08:35.074
[SPEAKER_03]: But smoking's bad.

01:08:35.134 --> 01:08:35.854
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't smoke.

01:08:35.914 --> 01:08:36.314
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

01:08:36.334 --> 01:08:37.014
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on.

01:08:37.054 --> 01:08:38.495
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:08:38.795 --> 01:08:41.916
[SPEAKER_03]: Miklatov, thank you for being here, at least the small portion of the show you were here.

01:08:42.396 --> 01:08:42.916
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.

01:08:43.197 --> 01:08:43.717
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.

01:08:43.737 --> 01:08:44.377
[SPEAKER_03]: Your final thought?

01:08:44.737 --> 01:08:45.417
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have one.

01:08:45.917 --> 01:08:47.078
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, your final thought?

01:08:49.114 --> 01:08:54.817
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta get home to watch some ripped copies of the new Family Guy.

01:08:55.277 --> 01:08:56.318
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully a new Family Guy.

01:08:56.518 --> 01:08:57.518
[SPEAKER_03]: There better be a new Family Guy.

01:08:58.158 --> 01:09:02.300
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is, what is up with those World of Warcraft style Google Maps?

01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:04.021
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people have way too much free time on their hands.

01:09:05.081 --> 01:09:08.423
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, your final thought?

01:09:08.583 --> 01:09:13.825
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to go home and doctor my resume because I have an interview tomorrow.

01:09:14.025 --> 01:09:14.706
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, good luck with that.

01:09:15.046 --> 01:09:16.146
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm a vegetarian now.

01:09:16.307 --> 01:09:20.749
[SPEAKER_03]: Warlord of the Universe is the position you're applying for, or what?

01:09:20.869 --> 01:09:22.850
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I've been doing this job already.

01:09:23.070 --> 01:09:25.351
[SPEAKER_08]: I may as well have the official title, you know?

01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:28.931
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that's it, you guys.

01:09:28.971 --> 01:09:32.392
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks so much for tuning in and listening to us this week, and we'll be back next week.

01:09:32.812 --> 01:09:42.014
[SPEAKER_03]: Next week on the program, no special guests yet, but we are trying to get someone on the show next week, so I don't want to say who just yet, but we're trying to get someone very closely connected with the Silent Hill franchise.

01:09:42.394 --> 01:09:46.195
[SPEAKER_03]: We're excited to get that person on, so we'll see if we get that.

01:09:46.315 --> 01:09:47.015
[SPEAKER_03]: It's me!

01:09:47.035 --> 01:09:47.655
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not.

01:09:47.675 --> 01:09:48.316
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, it's not.

01:09:48.416 --> 01:09:49.036
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, and...

01:09:49.827 --> 01:09:50.247
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

01:09:50.307 --> 01:09:57.291
[SPEAKER_03]: So stay tuned for that and of course all the controversy and humor that you've come to expect from your buddies here at Orange Lounge.

01:09:57.611 --> 01:09:59.232
[SPEAKER_03]: Until next week, have a good one.

01:10:01.173 --> 01:10:05.335
