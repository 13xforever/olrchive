And we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 172 for this, January 29th of 2006.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.540
and quite a busy first half there little bit a little bit of controversy was it

00:32.540 --> 00:35.440
was there a single controversial subject we didn't touch there on the first half

00:35.440 --> 00:43.600
I'm not sure we talked about politics sexuality a fast food talk about a midget

00:43.600 --> 00:47.980
rights oh well maybe in this half we'll see for those I need to be more midget

00:47.980 --> 00:51.180
gamers for those that were listening or that are listening to this on the

00:51.180 --> 00:54.380
podcast feed who haven't heard the first half of the show yet definitely go back

00:54.380 --> 00:58.920
and download the first half it's a it's a good show so check it out anyway we're

00:58.920 --> 01:02.420
gonna get back in because we have a lot of stuff to talk about in this half of

01:02.420 --> 01:06.260
the show and we're gonna start it off we'll start off with Loki who's got a

01:06.260 --> 01:11.360
story about Microsoft what's going on with Microsoft are they are they doing

01:11.360 --> 01:14.000
the handhelds or not this is a rumor it's been going on for a long time

01:14.000 --> 01:19.280
maybe that's I think the official response from it's something that

01:19.280 --> 01:22.160
they're looking towards because they want to compete with the iPod and

01:22.160 --> 01:27.680
looking at maybe starting up a portable gaming development team or something like that or

01:27.680 --> 01:30.440
portable something development team.

01:30.440 --> 01:32.240
So it's a maybe.

01:32.240 --> 01:35.800
That's pretty much I think what the official word's been.

01:35.800 --> 01:42.000
Something of course they're going to look at if they can figure out a way to do it profibly.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.800
So it'll be one of those things like okay well we'll see what happens but I'm not going

01:46.800 --> 01:48.960
to say yay or nay on it.

01:48.960 --> 01:55.020
There's definitely not any firm plans on it, so it's just going to be, you know, we'll

01:55.020 --> 01:57.020
have to wait for that.

01:57.020 --> 02:00.660
All right.

02:00.660 --> 02:05.820
Moving on, I have some feedback from the chat room on the controversial subjects.

02:05.820 --> 02:08.640
Somebody mentioned that we didn't mention Jack Thompson yet during the program.

02:08.640 --> 02:10.580
Tony mentioned that in the chat room there, so.

02:10.580 --> 02:11.580
Thank God.

02:11.580 --> 02:14.060
Well, I should give you guys an update on the Flowers for Jack campaign.

02:14.060 --> 02:17.620
Remember we talked about that last week and how we contributed $20 to that effort?

02:17.620 --> 02:18.620
Guess what?

02:18.620 --> 02:21.780
something like they raised a crazy amount of money I don't think they

02:21.780 --> 02:26.060
posted the final figure yet but when I last checked they had something like

02:26.060 --> 02:30.700
over $900 and it got to the point where it was they're gonna spend 650 on the

02:30.700 --> 02:35.420
flowers and the rest they're donating to and I forgive me I don't have time to

02:35.420 --> 02:38.920
dig for this right now I think it think it's called child's play which is the

02:38.920 --> 02:42.580
foundation that the penny arcade folks set up when they were getting you know

02:42.580 --> 02:46.740
hit with the Jack Thompson stuff too so that's that's great it's been a

02:46.740 --> 02:50.680
fundraiser in many ways so that's a good thing awesome so congratulations to the

02:50.680 --> 02:56.460
flowers for Jack folks so now I now we've now we've mentioned that all right

02:56.460 --> 03:01.920
anyway let's get back well you know talking about Jack sometimes um conjures

03:01.920 --> 03:05.340
these feelings inside of us that we just can't control these feelings of angst

03:05.340 --> 03:09.720
such such angst and that brings us to one of our favorite segments on the show

03:09.720 --> 03:14.560
the FUs of the week right dark Sakura oh yeah

03:25.640 --> 03:29.840
it's really my f you and you know I actually mentioned it already in the

03:29.840 --> 03:36.320
show but if you do that woman at Barnes & Noble you know just a big stinking pile

03:36.320 --> 03:42.760
poo on her because if you're going to say excuse me even if the people haven't

03:42.760 --> 03:46.960
heard you you still wait to acknowledge that they heard you before shoving

03:46.960 --> 03:51.000
somebody out of the way. I'm sorry what has happened to the state of manners

03:51.000 --> 03:57.920
here? How's that she had her grandchildren with her? She's teaching them that it is okay to push people out of the way.

03:57.920 --> 04:04.360
See Jack Thompson needs to focus on behavior like that. On just general rudeness and

04:04.360 --> 04:10.360
And the fact that people go around insulting and will not admit when they were the one who were at fault.

04:10.360 --> 04:12.360
I'm there.

04:12.360 --> 04:22.360
Loki, my FU of the week is going towards, you know, this is basically I have nothing right now, planet Earth for being a cocky bitch.

04:22.360 --> 04:24.360
What?

04:24.360 --> 04:31.080
What? Seriously, this plane is a cocky bitch and thinks it's like all, you know, holier

04:31.080 --> 04:35.240
than thou just because, you know, it's got life on it or something. I don't know. I got

04:35.240 --> 04:39.600
nothing, really, I don't. My week was okay. I have nothing that really pisses me. Oh wait,

04:39.600 --> 04:44.460
I do. I'm sorry, I take that back. Fuck uses goddamn people to keep parking in the fire

04:44.460 --> 04:49.320
lane thinking it's their own personal parking space even though there's a red curb there.

04:49.320 --> 04:54.640
goddamn day there's a car parked there and nobody tickets these cars. Well, fuck them,

04:54.640 --> 04:59.560
you see? Because if I want to back out of my car, you know, back out of my space, which

04:59.560 --> 05:03.900
happens to be in the corner of this entire parking lot, you know, I have to avoid these

05:03.900 --> 05:09.000
people that are parked in these illegal spaces. And the audacity of these people, they actually,

05:09.000 --> 05:15.440
you know, look at me like, what? You're in my way, you know? It's like, fuck them. I

05:15.440 --> 05:19.880
eat my apartment complex. See I knew you had it in you, being a liar. But I also hate her,

05:19.880 --> 05:24.160
because she is a cockadoo. Alright, uh, my F.U. of the week, my F.U. of the week goes

05:24.160 --> 05:27.860
to the Italian restaurant in Sacramento, and I'm not even gonna name it, because nobody

05:27.860 --> 05:32.160
outside the area would know it anyway. They gave me food poisoning yesterday. My pasta,

05:32.160 --> 05:36.240
like I had this dish that was lasagna and pasta, it was like a little bit of both, the

05:36.240 --> 05:39.800
pasta was cold, and I should have known that something was wrong then, because that probably

05:39.800 --> 05:43.840
means my meat lasagna was undercooked, and I got very very sick last night, and that's

05:43.840 --> 05:49.300
no fun at all. Food poisoning sucks. So, yeah, thank you. I know this isn't television, but

05:49.300 --> 05:51.840
Jamie's doing the cry face from Battle Royale.

05:51.840 --> 05:55.840
Try not to have your head exploded, okay?

05:55.840 --> 06:01.840
So, well, something exploded last night, but it wasn't my head, I'll tell you that. Ew.

06:01.840 --> 06:03.840
Alright, moving on.

06:03.840 --> 06:05.840
You're listening to KTMI.

06:05.840 --> 06:11.500
Uh, let's change the subject promptly. Let's talk about a much happier thing. Let's talk

06:11.500 --> 06:19.640
about Konami Gamers Day! Yay! Are you bitter about that, Dark Sakura? I'm bitter because

06:19.640 --> 06:25.320
I had to spend the day at my job. I'm sorry. Well, Loki and I got a rare opportunity to

06:25.320 --> 06:29.400
go to Konami Gamers Day this week and check out all the Konami products that are coming

06:29.400 --> 06:33.720
out this year, at least in the first two months of the year. It was awesome. Dark Sakura,

06:33.720 --> 06:38.760
I don't want you to feel left out, so we have gifts for Dark Sakura that we brought back

06:38.760 --> 06:42.620
from Gamers Day. No, stop crying, you're going to love these gifts.

06:42.620 --> 06:46.680
This is a poster, it's a Metal Gear Saga poster.

06:46.680 --> 06:49.800
Very rare, it's a promotional poster.

06:49.800 --> 06:53.820
And check this out, here's what I do with press kits.

06:53.820 --> 06:57.300
I'm going to give Jamie the press kit for a Metal Gear Saga as well so she can

06:57.300 --> 06:58.140
check that out

06:58.140 --> 07:02.220
with her husband Dan who's a big Metal Gear fan as well.

07:02.220 --> 07:05.500
You know what he was playing today was Gran Turismo 2.

07:05.500 --> 07:07.080
That has nothing to do with Metal Gear or Konami.

07:07.080 --> 07:08.080
No.

07:08.080 --> 07:09.080
Okay.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.080
Anyway, so don't feel left out.

07:10.080 --> 07:11.080
There you go.

07:11.080 --> 07:14.160
But I'm giving you guys that press kit for a reason, so you can report on that for the

07:14.160 --> 07:16.040
site too, and the stuff blog.

07:16.040 --> 07:17.600
It even smells pressy.

07:17.600 --> 07:18.600
Alright.

07:18.600 --> 07:22.820
So, meanwhile, while Jamie's ogling that, Loki and I want to talk about Konami Gamers

07:22.820 --> 07:25.840
Day a little bit, but, Jamie, feel free to interject your thoughts, because you probably

07:25.840 --> 07:27.280
have an opinion on these games as well.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.960
Loki, what'd you think of Konami Gamers Day?

07:28.960 --> 07:30.280
It was a fun, it was a good time.

07:30.280 --> 07:31.280
It was fun.

07:31.280 --> 07:32.280
I loved it.

07:32.280 --> 07:33.280
Yeah.

07:33.280 --> 07:37.320
inviting us and you know letting the podcast world get exposure to that as

07:37.320 --> 07:38.640
well is a good time

07:38.640 --> 07:41.680
yeah so let's talk about let's talk about some of the games we saw okay all

07:41.680 --> 07:45.200
right did you check out Tao's adventure a little bit it's a role-playing game

07:45.200 --> 07:47.240
coming out for the DS is going to be out soon

07:47.240 --> 07:50.980
I played a little bit the the build that they were showing there though was like

07:50.980 --> 07:55.120
the full game so it started me off from the beginning so it was kind of slow to

07:55.120 --> 07:59.120
get into so I seriously spent like 30 minutes of this game and barely got

07:59.120 --> 08:02.860
anywhere I mean I kind of learned that you cast spells by drawing little

08:02.860 --> 08:06.380
symbols on the bottom part you have to memorize like to cast a lightning spell

08:06.380 --> 08:09.580
you draw a little lightning bolt it seemed okay but it seemed like kind of

08:09.580 --> 08:13.300
like just your average run-of-the-mill RPG it there was nothing about it that

08:13.300 --> 08:17.980
really excited me I don't know if you feel the same way Loki it was yeah it was

08:17.980 --> 08:22.100
okay I think I think folks who are into RPGs and it seems like one of those

08:22.100 --> 08:25.420
monster collection type of games you might get a kick out of that Street

08:25.420 --> 08:28.860
Supremacy Loki would you think Street Supremacy a racing game that's coming

08:28.860 --> 08:31.660
out for the PSP by Konami well it's actually pretty cool and what it is is

08:31.660 --> 08:39.660
It's sort of a port of Tokyo Xtreme Racer, so if you've played that series you've pretty much kind of have an idea what this game is going to be like.

08:39.660 --> 08:50.660
Looks pretty cool, and it reminded me, the comparison I had with it, it reminded me of Wangdens Midnight Tune, the arcade game, it reminded me of that.

08:50.660 --> 08:57.660
But it's a pretty good game, there's not that many racing games out there for the PSP, so, you know, more the merrier.

08:57.660 --> 09:02.880
And I know the price point on it's pretty cheap when it's coming out, so I I ran out of time to check out

09:02.880 --> 09:06.520
Street supremacy, but it looked okay. I mean I'm not a big huge on racing

09:06.520 --> 09:09.700
I like burnout, but we'll see maybe I'll check it out one thing

09:09.700 --> 09:16.040
I liked a lot on the PSP was a Gradius collection sweet. I like that played through a little bit of Gradius one and

09:16.560 --> 09:21.800
It's cool because they changed it a little bit so that it's widescreen, and it doesn't really do it by stretching the image

09:22.220 --> 09:25.260
So much I I think it happens a little bit

09:25.260 --> 09:29.060
But they kind of went back and redid it and you can tell they changed some things about the game, too

09:29.060 --> 09:33.980
For instance the first boss that you fight happens immediately after the volcano

09:34.260 --> 09:39.500
Sequence in the first stage for those of you guys that have played Gradius before so the volcanoes are in the way while you're trying

09:39.500 --> 09:41.840
To fight the boss, so that's a little bit of extra challenge to it

09:41.840 --> 09:45.220
Which I thought was kind of cool means you can't sit in the hidey spot, right exactly exactly

09:45.420 --> 09:50.340
So they they they changed that a little bit and they made it more seamless like it's a very seamless kind of game

09:50.340 --> 09:53.540
That's the only one I checked out but Gradius collection is gonna have several Gradius games in it

09:53.540 --> 09:56.640
you know that's gonna mean is it's gonna be nine versions of of uh... gradius we

09:56.640 --> 09:58.800
own no proteus though

09:58.800 --> 10:02.840
and that makes me upset we need more proteus maybe later

10:02.840 --> 10:08.740
rumba roses x x lucky to check this out seems all tina yeah all tina i i'm

10:08.740 --> 10:12.480
rumba roses is okay but the problem i have with this game in wrestling games

10:12.480 --> 10:17.520
in general is that it's kind of slow the actions very slow in these kinds of

10:17.520 --> 10:20.880
games very slow seen that's the things they're touting that the game had you

10:20.880 --> 10:26.920
know, probably the best visuals on the 360, but the movements are all really jerky, and

10:26.920 --> 10:27.920
that's the thing.

10:27.920 --> 10:30.880
But other than that, it plays very similar to the first game.

10:30.880 --> 10:34.800
The only differences I could say is, my description of this would be like, it's kind of a cross

10:34.800 --> 10:39.240
between DOA 4 and DOA Beach Volleyball, is the best way to describe it.

10:39.240 --> 10:44.840
Because they have this photo mode, you can make your characters busty and almost naked,

10:44.840 --> 10:49.000
and then just all different sort of things on them to kind of customize them to play

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
online.

10:50.000 --> 10:56.840
I was taking notes during the keynote speeches and I remember Akari Uchida, who's the producer

10:56.840 --> 11:00.480
of Rumble Roses XX, said that they were making fun of DOA a little bit.

11:00.480 --> 11:01.480
Remember that?

11:01.480 --> 11:03.000
He said, yeah, we're making fun of DOA in this part.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.400
Because they have sequences in the gate, they have a photo shoot sequence, like you can

11:06.400 --> 11:11.040
take pictures, sexy pictures of the folks and low-key something like that.

11:11.040 --> 11:12.040
It's all T&A.

11:12.040 --> 11:14.440
Yeah, it's all T&A.

11:14.440 --> 11:17.360
It's fun and I think it's a party game to me.

11:17.360 --> 11:19.160
I'll be picking it up, for sure.

11:19.160 --> 11:21.480
Let's watch the Super Bowl and play some Rumba Roses.

11:21.480 --> 11:24.480
There's one fighting game for the 360.

11:24.480 --> 11:25.280
I mean, come on.

11:25.280 --> 11:27.400
It's going to sell.

11:27.400 --> 11:30.320
And it's a pretty fun game.

11:30.320 --> 11:33.280
And definitely just for the T&A factor, I mean, it works.

11:33.280 --> 11:35.400
And you'll be able to play it online, which I thought

11:35.400 --> 11:35.900
was cool.

11:35.900 --> 11:37.680
And you can customize your character,

11:37.680 --> 11:39.560
including the size of the boobs.

11:39.560 --> 11:40.860
You can customize.

11:40.860 --> 11:42.880
The producer was kind of saying, oh, everybody,

11:42.880 --> 11:47.400
it won't just be anesthesia versus anesthesia,

11:47.400 --> 11:48.480
and they look the same.

11:48.480 --> 11:52.000
you could customize the colors in the and the size and shape of it but i'm

11:52.000 --> 11:53.160
like okay on live

11:53.160 --> 11:56.560
they're all going to have huge test their create a wrestler

11:56.560 --> 12:00.140
not so it i think that was kind of their response to create a wrestler they had

12:00.140 --> 12:04.000
a being able to create one yes and no they do i think have a career wrestler

12:04.000 --> 12:07.240
and then you can also modify the ones that they have on their i got the sense

12:07.240 --> 12:11.200
the creator wrestlers more you modify the existing one significantly

12:11.200 --> 12:13.420
not like soul caliber create a character

12:13.420 --> 12:15.260
will differ

12:15.260 --> 12:20.220
But the other things that they were going to have, they were a little bit different

12:20.220 --> 12:26.380
with it. I know other than the create a character type stuff, which was pretty cool. Then they

12:26.380 --> 12:30.220
have the tag team matches. They're also going to have downloadable content later, like more

12:30.220 --> 12:34.860
costumes and whatnot. Plus there was some weird stuff. If you caught it in the videos,

12:34.860 --> 12:38.860
they have a robot character and then there's two bears that are in the game, much like

12:38.860 --> 12:41.980
Tekken. So they've got that in there as well.

12:41.980 --> 12:45.520
Who is fighting? Oh my gosh, Bear is fighting. How can this be?

12:45.520 --> 12:47.980
Metal Gear Substinence!

12:47.980 --> 12:50.980
Subs-Substinence? I can never say this. Subs-Subs-Subs-

12:50.980 --> 12:54.780
Okay. Subs-uh-stuh-nance.

12:54.780 --> 12:58.080
Substinence. I-I- Metal Gear is one of those-

12:58.080 --> 13:01.540
I'm gonna- I can't- I don't have time to play everything, guys. I do have a day job as

13:01.540 --> 13:02.780
well as this program.

13:02.780 --> 13:05.440
Metal Gear is one of those series I don't follow. I leave it to Jamie to follow the

13:05.440 --> 13:06.860
series and correct me on it.

13:06.860 --> 13:10.380
So, but, Loki, did you check this out? Metal Gear Subs- I looked at it briefly.

13:10.380 --> 13:13.860
What did you think? It was good. I like how they've added the multiplayer in there.

13:13.860 --> 13:15.940
That's definitely going to be the highlight of the game.

13:15.940 --> 13:18.780
I like all the add-ons they're gonna have for this. Like you get the Metal Gear

13:18.780 --> 13:22.180
Saga DVD. They were showing clips from that. That looks very cool. Well,

13:22.180 --> 13:26.060
only if you pre-order at a major retailer like GameStop or EV or whatever, but most

13:26.060 --> 13:26.980
people are, so...

13:26.980 --> 13:30.220
You'll probably be able to get it either way. And the original Metal Gear

13:30.220 --> 13:33.660
on NES and Metal Gear 2. That's true. The MSX.

13:33.660 --> 13:37.580
Exactly. Not the one that Kojima pretty much wrote off. What was Snake's

13:37.580 --> 13:39.140
Revenge? Snake's Revenge, yeah. Not that one.

13:39.140 --> 13:40.460
The real Metal Gear 2.

13:40.460 --> 13:41.460
I thought that was interesting.

13:41.460 --> 13:45.860
The MSX one was actually pretty fun and it had the things that they referred to back

13:45.860 --> 13:51.780
in the first Metal Gear Solid about Big Boss and Gray Fox, a lot of that was involved in

13:51.780 --> 13:52.780
Metal Gear 2.

13:52.780 --> 13:53.780
Very true.

13:53.780 --> 13:58.340
And actually they have, they go into that in the Saga DVD as they were talking about

13:58.340 --> 13:59.340
all that stuff.

13:59.340 --> 14:00.340
I thought it was very interesting.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.900
Did you, were you watching a little preview and it had Kojima talking about how Metal

14:03.900 --> 14:07.180
Gear Solid 3 had a very maternal theme in it and all that stuff?

14:07.180 --> 14:08.180
Yeah.

14:08.180 --> 14:11.620
interesting some of the stuff he said so check that out on the DVD sweet code and

14:11.620 --> 14:16.100
five is another one I kind of ran out of time to look at and it's a good thing

14:16.100 --> 14:18.340
meatlet off stepped out for a little bit or he probably punched me right now

14:18.340 --> 14:21.460
because he loves sweet coding did you check it out at all I like I'm not a

14:21.460 --> 14:25.140
huge we couldn't fan I looked at it it looked pretty but you know it's it's

14:25.140 --> 14:28.380
not a sui coding game it's gonna be the same type of thing yeah if you're into

14:28.380 --> 14:33.940
sui coding from what I hear five is better than four but maybe not quite as

14:33.940 --> 14:37.540
good as one and two but it's it's it's worthwhile having for for those you guys

14:37.540 --> 14:40.900
during this week. One game I definitely checked out was Beatmania.

14:40.900 --> 14:44.500
What did you think of Beatmania? Beatmania is cool. I like the licensed songs in there.

14:44.500 --> 14:47.500
That was done very well. Funky Town?

14:47.500 --> 14:52.340
Won't you take me to Funky Town? Yeah, and they're all remixes too. They're all like garage remixes.

14:52.340 --> 14:55.340
They had Toxic on there.

14:55.340 --> 14:58.620
But yeah, I played them. They're cool.

14:58.620 --> 15:01.500
And I like the new controller. New controller is awesome. New controller will

15:01.500 --> 15:02.260
still flip.

15:02.260 --> 15:05.460
So if you're right side pried, left side pried, whatever, it still flips. But the side

15:05.460 --> 15:07.060
with the turntable is rounded.

15:07.060 --> 15:10.260
so it's a little different but I'm hearing I'm hearing it's more spring

15:10.260 --> 15:14.120
action in the keys so the keys won't stick like the Japanese controllers did

15:14.120 --> 15:15.120
so that's great it played

15:15.120 --> 15:18.820
it played fine for me I had a good time with the game. My controller doesn't stick.

15:18.820 --> 15:22.380
Well consider yourself lucky. You still should pick up one of these US controllers.

15:22.380 --> 15:23.880
I have a mutant controller

15:23.880 --> 15:27.580
okay and I am gonna pick up a US controller. And if you do happen to have a controller the game

15:27.580 --> 15:30.420
will be offered with the controller without the controller so

15:30.420 --> 15:34.740
Oh I didn't pick that part up. That means they know we're out there.

15:34.740 --> 15:38.300
That's why I have the advantage for working at a distributor.

15:38.300 --> 15:41.620
For those you guys concerned about the authenticity compared to the Japanese

15:41.620 --> 15:42.840
originals, I'm told that

15:42.840 --> 15:46.340
another's do show up in the game, they're just locked away at the start,

15:46.340 --> 15:49.420
but you can unlock the another's for those you guys that really want the

15:49.420 --> 15:50.140
difficult stuff.

15:50.140 --> 15:54.540
I am hearing they change some note charts, but I'm hearing from

15:54.540 --> 15:58.820
folks who play a lot of Beatmania that it's not as bad as you think.

15:58.820 --> 16:02.660
They change note charts mostly to add in some of the free scratch zones

16:02.660 --> 16:05.500
and things cuz they are bringing over the free scratch zones which showed up I

16:05.500 --> 16:06.020
think in some

16:06.020 --> 16:09.460
early early BeatMania games and then BeatMania 3. They had that, I noticed it was in

16:09.460 --> 16:13.740
Metal Gear Solid the remix cuz I remember I have BeatMania 2nd mix and I don't

16:13.740 --> 16:15.500
remember the free scratching being there

16:15.500 --> 16:19.420
but they added that in there or something. It was in 4th mix, it was in

16:19.420 --> 16:23.820
CM2, it was also I think it was removed from

16:23.820 --> 16:28.020
I think if memory serves me correctly I do think that it was in 2DX

16:28.020 --> 16:31.340
up until I want to say the substream

16:31.340 --> 16:34.880
release the one that linked to DDR second mix right

16:34.880 --> 16:40.920
and then after that no more questions from chat room here spirits nair wants to

16:40.920 --> 16:43.200
know how did the controller feel I wanna know

16:43.200 --> 16:46.360
it felt like the regular controllers to me but just

16:46.360 --> 16:49.460
the key taps were a little different but nothing

16:49.460 --> 16:53.440
nothing that's gonna throw you I mean it it feels it feels nice I think the US

16:53.440 --> 16:55.660
players gonna be very pleased at the improvements over the Japanese

16:55.660 --> 16:56.640
controllers I really do

16:56.640 --> 17:01.200
So, I'm very excited about that.

17:01.200 --> 17:03.980
Moving on, what did you think of the Silent Hill experience?

17:03.980 --> 17:05.540
I thought this was interesting.

17:05.540 --> 17:07.240
It's different.

17:07.240 --> 17:14.620
It's not a game, but it's like a comic book slash audio and visual tour of the Silent

17:14.620 --> 17:22.480
Hill series on the PSP that includes the first four games and the movie.

17:22.480 --> 17:23.480
It reminded me of the...

17:23.480 --> 17:24.920
Does it address the Game Boy one?

17:24.920 --> 17:25.920
No, I don't think...

17:25.920 --> 17:30.640
I don't know. They didn't say specifically. It reminded me of them almost like selling

17:30.640 --> 17:35.780
a special features disc for the movie by itself. That's what it feels like.

17:35.780 --> 17:40.580
They actually did that for Metal Gear Solid 2.

17:40.580 --> 17:43.160
And they were actually doing something very similar for Metal Gear. Now to bring that

17:43.160 --> 17:46.720
up, the Metal Gear comics, they're also going to be doing on the PSP. You can have these

17:46.720 --> 17:52.360
comics on the PSP. It looked very well detailed and well drawn. It looked pretty cool and

17:52.360 --> 17:56.720
a little bit interactive as well. So I know one thing they were really pushing

17:56.720 --> 17:59.820
during the keynotes was innovation. Konami wants to innovate this year and these two

17:59.820 --> 18:02.000
products definitely show that they want to be innovative.

18:02.000 --> 18:06.440
For me, the deciding factor on the Silent Hill experience is price point.

18:06.440 --> 18:10.720
Because if Silent Hill experience costs as much as a normal PSP game, I don't

18:10.720 --> 18:12.140
think that's fair because it's not a game.

18:12.140 --> 18:15.840
But if it's a $20 thing, I think it'll be great. And they're not the only ones doing comics either.

18:15.840 --> 18:19.400
Hmm. Capcom is getting in on that kind of action as well.

18:19.400 --> 18:25.900
Oh interesting. Yeah, interesting. All right. What did you think of Metal Gear acid 2? Metal Gear acid 2 is pretty good

18:25.900 --> 18:29.300
I'd never I didn't really care for the first one. It looks pretty fun

18:29.300 --> 18:34.540
I'm just not in I really kind of wanted a Metal Gear solid game. Not really a card battle game

18:34.540 --> 18:36.540
I really hate card battle games

18:37.060 --> 18:39.140
every single one of them

18:39.140 --> 18:40.540
the

18:40.540 --> 18:41.980
solid I

18:41.980 --> 18:45.020
wasn't as solid as I thought it would it's gonna be and

18:45.020 --> 18:47.780
And, okay, we have to explain the solid eye.

18:47.780 --> 18:50.020
It's actually a cardboard cutout,

18:50.020 --> 18:53.020
goggle thing that you can put over your PSP

18:53.020 --> 18:55.840
and the game will play in some 3D fashion.

18:55.840 --> 18:59.100
I had Virtual Boy flashbacks playing this thing.

18:59.100 --> 19:00.080
It didn't work for me.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.820
I didn't care for the 3D thing very much.

19:01.820 --> 19:03.120
I thought it was kind of a cheesy feature,

19:03.120 --> 19:05.620
but you can take it off and the game looks fine.

19:05.620 --> 19:07.180
Like, it's interesting,

19:07.180 --> 19:08.020
because the way it works

19:08.020 --> 19:09.620
is that it doesn't ruin the visuals of the game.

19:09.620 --> 19:11.700
So, I don't know how much I'd actually use this,

19:11.700 --> 19:12.940
the 3D goggle thing.

19:12.940 --> 19:14.340
It's a throwaway feature to me.

19:14.340 --> 19:18.200
It was kind of cool, but the other thing that I thought was funny, because this was in the

19:18.200 --> 19:22.580
Japanese version, they were talking about the sexy girls, they do have a lot of sexy

19:22.580 --> 19:23.580
girls.

19:23.580 --> 19:28.320
In fact, I remember seeing a dump of this game online or whatever, and half of the disc

19:28.320 --> 19:33.180
was all movies of sexy girls and camo and stuff, so.

19:33.180 --> 19:35.220
Karaoke Revolution Country.

19:35.220 --> 19:36.220
Yeah.

19:36.220 --> 19:39.380
I heard about this.

19:39.380 --> 19:44.260
This to me, I was like a vampire and it was garlic, and I was staying far away from the

19:44.260 --> 19:48.680
it it was the first game I played actually it was an okay looking game

19:48.680 --> 19:53.080
I just I don't like country music and we I don't have a very good

19:53.080 --> 19:57.040
experience with that curio revolution it's very similar to kr party

19:57.040 --> 20:00.320
I'm it runs on almost the exact same interface but I thought was interesting

20:00.320 --> 20:02.320
is they've added some interesting I toy features

20:02.320 --> 20:06.520
you know how in kr party you could create a character you can also create a

20:06.520 --> 20:09.520
character in the country one but you can take your own picture on the I toy and

20:09.520 --> 20:10.480
have your face

20:10.480 --> 20:13.600
on the character which I thought was very interesting and

20:13.600 --> 20:19.120
You can also do the itoy thing. Some backgrounds have big TV monitors and it'll put you singing in your living room

20:19.440 --> 20:21.440
uh in the TV monitors and that's it that's

20:21.600 --> 20:28.560
It's cheesy, but it's cute. Like I think it'll be fun for for the party atmosphere of karaoke revolution. I think it's cute and

20:29.680 --> 20:32.960
Whereas I probably won't buy this game because i'm not much of a country fan

20:33.040 --> 20:37.200
I think it's good that they're opening up opening this franchise up to a good to a new audience

20:37.840 --> 20:41.840
I think and the partnership with cmt as well smart move. Yeah, definitely and

20:41.840 --> 20:45.880
And you know, for my limited knowledge of country songs,

20:45.880 --> 20:48.480
it's a pretty good mix.

20:48.480 --> 20:49.400
Yu-Gi-Oh!

20:49.400 --> 20:50.740
USB.

20:50.740 --> 20:52.120
It's a little Yu-Gi-Oh!

20:52.120 --> 20:54.600
game you can put on the, or it's Yu-Gi-Oh!

20:54.600 --> 20:56.640
that's already on the USB, and you can basically

20:56.640 --> 20:59.140
take it anywhere with you, plug it into the computer, and go.

20:59.140 --> 21:02.720
It's an innovation thing, but I mean, Yu-Gi-Oh!, great.

21:02.720 --> 21:04.120
I thought it was quite interesting

21:04.120 --> 21:06.520
how they wanted to explain how it worked,

21:06.520 --> 21:08.200
and I'm like, I think we get it.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.640
You know?

21:09.640 --> 21:10.680
All right.

21:10.680 --> 21:14.840
How about DDR Supernova? No, I didn't play that at all. Let's see.

21:14.840 --> 21:20.520
I was the first person in the United States outside of Konami to play the game, so...

21:20.520 --> 21:24.360
You're staking that claim right there? Staking that claim, I believe I was number

21:24.360 --> 21:28.760
four to play under that machine, besides Jason Enos and two other Konami employees that were

21:28.760 --> 21:35.760
testing it out. I was on that game almost all day. It was great. I love it. I'm really

21:35.760 --> 21:41.980
Really out of shape though and my only complaint is max or fascination max

21:41.980 --> 21:47.400
I think it's a dumb sounding song and the step bonus stage. Yeah, the bonus stage the boss song or whatever

21:47.400 --> 21:52.540
It sounds like a really crappy fan mix and the steps it reminds me of a really bad sim file

21:52.660 --> 22:00.060
That's it's really sad that that's you know, because they could do so much better and I remember like, you know paranoia

22:00.940 --> 22:04.940
Respect that was a cool remix of paranoia and it sounded cool and was hard

22:04.940 --> 22:08.860
but it's starting to get to the point now with max you have max period which

22:08.860 --> 22:13.220
was just bullshit as it was as a song and a remix and now this is just a step

22:13.220 --> 22:18.020
beyond that and it I don't know might some people like it because it's super

22:18.020 --> 22:22.520
hard I personally didn't care for it but you know what there's 300 and some songs

22:22.520 --> 22:27.660
in this thing who cares one song one song in it I don't care I had a real

22:27.660 --> 22:33.060
good time playing it to um a lot of repeats for me but I'm I understand that

22:33.060 --> 22:37.900
DDR this is an early build and I think a lot of folks on like DDR freaking stuff

22:37.900 --> 22:42.720
or take running with this like I think there's still much more news to come on

22:42.720 --> 22:45.840
DDR supernova I'm just happy it's coming back to the arcades you have to

22:45.840 --> 22:50.960
understand that the build that we played on was 50% done add 230 songs on it

22:50.960 --> 22:55.580
right now most of which were repeats but who cares there it's just the old stuff

22:55.580 --> 23:00.060
there's that means 70 new songs that are gonna be in there so I'm very curious to

23:00.060 --> 23:02.940
check out battle mode because that's something I've been bitching about needs

23:02.940 --> 23:07.860
to be in an arcade DDR that's not Disney Mix for a long long time and I'm really

23:07.860 --> 23:10.860
excited to see the battle mode I want to see what this is all about because I

23:10.860 --> 23:14.700
think DDR could be marketed as a very competitive game and it looks like it's

23:14.700 --> 23:17.740
kind of going that way because they're they're doing the tournaments and you

23:17.740 --> 23:22.980
know like tournament mode it's going to be released in all three regions US UK

23:22.980 --> 23:27.940
and Japan what's going to be great also the interface is really strange there's

23:27.940 --> 23:31.580
no more backgrounds to songs I've noticed like you know no more background

23:31.580 --> 23:36.320
pictures. I completely missed that. It's all just normal video unless it actually has a

23:36.320 --> 23:40.440
video then it's got you know other than that it's got like the 3D stage with the dancers

23:40.440 --> 23:43.520
and stuff. But that could be something that's still being worked on too we don't know. Yeah

23:43.520 --> 23:48.040
it's hard to say. Mods and stuff they were pretty much all the same mods they had the

23:48.040 --> 23:52.680
only thing that I noticed that was different kind of taking it from almost like step mania

23:52.680 --> 23:56.200
jumps you can remove the jumps from the songs so if you don't want to have a lot of that

23:56.200 --> 24:02.080
stuff and then they renamed kind of what the different note patterns were called

24:02.080 --> 24:07.300
and stuff I have to correct myself huh I just did this thing again and it's

24:07.300 --> 24:14.720
substance Oh subsistence subsistence yes subsistence anyway so DER supernova

24:14.720 --> 24:17.420
thumbs up for me I definitely approve and I think the best is still yet to

24:17.420 --> 24:20.740
come on DER supernova I think I I understand they're taking it around the

24:20.740 --> 24:24.600
country right now in location test isn't so Cal right now and it's probably the

24:24.600 --> 24:29.320
same machine we played at Gamers' Day. I'm pretty sure it is. It probably took it down to SoCal.

24:29.320 --> 24:32.480
Don't consider it a finished game just yet.

24:32.480 --> 24:34.520
It's only 50% done.

24:34.520 --> 24:38.280
Did you hear though that Naoki and Taka actually went down from Gamers' Day

24:38.280 --> 24:41.960
to the location test? Yeah, I saw that. Yeah, very interesting. Yeah, that was kind of

24:41.960 --> 24:45.480
funny, the whole story with Naoki. He was there taking pictures of the

24:45.480 --> 24:47.600
machine and people playing and stuff.

24:47.600 --> 24:51.160
He was kind of running around like a little girl. It was kind of funny.

24:51.160 --> 24:57.600
just, you know, watching them, you know, so excited about everything. It was great. But,

24:57.600 --> 25:04.600
you know, and we got some cool GIFs and stuff and, I don't know, new songs, interesting

25:05.280 --> 25:11.760
to say the least. Not too impressed with some of them. I could care for a little bit less

25:11.760 --> 25:18.760
Toxic being in Superhero, oh, that reminds me, Toxic in Beatmania. I like what they did

25:18.760 --> 25:25.760
I like what they did with the videos in the background because it kind of reminded me of new videos for the songs which are pretty cool.

25:25.760 --> 25:33.760
Did you notice though in some of the videos they didn't bother changing them? Like at Colors it still says 2DX 6 style in the corner in the video. They didn't bother taking them out.

25:33.760 --> 25:41.760
Well I don't know because they looked like a finished build to me and I noticed this when Taka was playing against the Konami employee, Ferrari, when they were battling each other.

25:41.760 --> 25:45.760
each other. Ferrari won, by the way, and Taka failed the song. They were playing colors,

25:45.760 --> 25:48.800
and they had a little six-style logo in the corner. I noticed that, and it looked like

25:48.800 --> 25:51.800
a final build of the game to me. I mean, this thing's coming out pretty soon, so I think

25:51.800 --> 25:54.080
they just didn't bother changing it, but, you know, who cares?

25:54.080 --> 25:56.480
It hasn't gotten gold yet, though, so I think it's fine.

25:56.480 --> 26:00.040
We'll see, we'll see. Anything else you want to say about Konami Gamers' Day?

26:00.040 --> 26:05.340
I just, you know, I'm really glad to have gone. I wish they had shown more stuff that's

26:05.340 --> 26:10.420
coming out, because most of the stuff that they covered is just up till March.

26:10.420 --> 26:13.500
So that leaves the whole rest of the year.

26:13.500 --> 26:19.220
I was hoping Ultramix 4 or something like that, Silent Hill 5, but I guess I gotta wait

26:19.220 --> 26:20.220
for E3.

26:20.220 --> 26:24.340
Alright, thanks again to Konami for the invitation, and we're looking forward to covering other

26:24.340 --> 26:28.740
companies' press events as well, wink wink, nudge nudge, folks, right?

26:28.740 --> 26:32.540
Jamie's itching to go to a Capcom thing, I think, so we'll see.

26:32.540 --> 26:33.540
Namco!

26:33.540 --> 26:34.540
Namco!

26:34.540 --> 26:40.860
Alright, anyway, Jamie, speaking of Jamie, Jamie, since she unfortunately was not able

26:40.860 --> 26:47.680
to go to Gamers' Day, she was at school and at work, and she was also painting and reading

26:47.680 --> 26:48.680
your letters.

26:48.680 --> 26:52.420
Yes, I was also reading letters while I was supposed to be at school.

26:52.420 --> 26:58.000
So when you guys send in your emails to Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com, DarkSakura reads

26:58.000 --> 27:00.060
them and throws them away.

27:00.060 --> 27:01.060
And then I laugh at them.

27:01.060 --> 27:02.060
No, just kidding.

27:02.060 --> 27:05.980
She brings them Sunday nights to the show with her to read them live on air, at least

27:05.980 --> 27:06.980
some select pieces.

27:06.980 --> 27:11.220
So Dark Sakura, reach into that mailbag and tell us who wrote us this week.

27:11.220 --> 27:18.940
Well, just to go ahead and make a quick statement, I am going to be limiting some of my letters

27:18.940 --> 27:24.240
to maybe about the top of, I'd say, six letters that I receive.

27:24.240 --> 27:26.940
So these are tonight's grouping.

27:26.940 --> 27:30.140
These are the lucky few.

27:30.140 --> 27:35.460
I'd like to start off with a letter from Simmel, who's one of our UK listeners.

27:35.460 --> 27:41.980
So just to let you know, in the UK, we have Go Sudoku for PSP, it's a multiplayer and

27:41.980 --> 27:42.980
downloadable puzzle.

27:42.980 --> 27:43.980
Best of all, it's only £20.

27:43.980 --> 27:48.080
Oh, sorry, we were talking about Sudoku last week, so I guess they already have a version

27:48.080 --> 27:49.400
of it over there in the UK.

27:49.400 --> 27:51.700
They probably have a cheap one here, I just don't know of it.

27:51.700 --> 27:57.020
On average, though, PSP games in the UK are nearly between £35 to £40.

27:57.020 --> 27:59.820
So that's actually a really good price.

27:59.820 --> 28:02.620
I wonder how that compares to how much those books cost.

28:02.620 --> 28:04.540
I'd rather have a PSP game before I have a book.

28:04.540 --> 28:07.740
It'd be about like us buying a PSP game for 35 bucks.

28:07.740 --> 28:12.460
I just don't see myself buying Sudoku on any system when a god like Tetris is right around

28:12.460 --> 28:13.460
the corner for DS.

28:13.460 --> 28:14.460
You know?

28:14.460 --> 28:15.460
That's just me.

28:15.460 --> 28:18.300
Well also he likes to say that he enjoys listening to the new format and likes how the show's

28:18.300 --> 28:19.300
progressing.

28:19.300 --> 28:20.300
Thank you.

28:20.300 --> 28:21.780
Well thank you!

28:21.780 --> 28:27.880
Another letter comes from DJ Ratchet, who's one of our, I think one of our newer people

28:27.880 --> 28:33.540
on the forums too, he wants to say that he loves the podcast, thank you, and has questions

28:33.540 --> 28:37.780
about Kingdom Hearts 2, estimated release date in the US and if there's really a Tron

28:37.780 --> 28:44.500
level. Yes, there is a Tron level! I do have a friend who owns the Japanese release, I'm

28:44.500 --> 28:51.740
supposed to be obtaining it shortly myself, and from what I understand, you know, I actually

28:51.740 --> 28:56.820
did have the release date, I do believe it's the end of March? 31st, actually it was 29th

28:56.820 --> 29:01.980
the 34 I think it's 31st now right I actually I got my date through my

29:01.980 --> 29:06.560
resource too but it's good they lining up that's a good sign mine's pre-ordered

29:06.560 --> 29:10.200
mines pre-ordered already but not only is there a Tron level there's also a

29:10.200 --> 29:16.480
steamboat Willie level which is so adorable there's okay I think that

29:16.480 --> 29:21.920
they're getting into the whole music game thing because the entire undersea

29:21.920 --> 29:25.240
level is like big old working music game

29:25.240 --> 29:27.920
interesting all right you you repeat

29:27.920 --> 29:29.320
little motions and hit your little

29:29.320 --> 29:32.440
button on time and you make sort of sing

29:32.440 --> 29:34.040
along with Ariel and all them and

29:34.040 --> 29:36.000
listening to the Japanese version of

29:36.000 --> 29:39.280
under the sea is freaking hilarious and

29:39.280 --> 29:41.720
the whole what's the song that she sings

29:41.720 --> 29:43.440
when she's in the cave the only world

29:43.440 --> 29:49.320
no don't don't ask me okay but it's just

29:49.320 --> 29:51.680
part of their world part of your

29:51.680 --> 29:55.960
world is that it something close every Disney song has something about I want

29:55.960 --> 30:02.720
to be accepted by the world I'm an outcast and I want to be loved I want to

30:02.720 --> 30:06.320
be accepted by Blizzard I want to be loved in World of Warcraft for the

30:06.320 --> 30:11.760
record there is a sixth emo Ranger now okay anyway um yeah but those levels are

30:11.760 --> 30:16.600
really on there and he also agrees with my take on the big bully of the gaming

30:16.600 --> 30:24.220
industry you evil I'm just moving on Jack Thompson also let's have tea has

30:24.220 --> 30:29.260
emailed us and said I love that nickname I love it our listeners and emailers

30:29.260 --> 30:33.280
have the best nicknames in the world I mean we had poo face made a comment in

30:33.280 --> 30:38.020
the first hour of the show we have let's have tea this is awesome all right but

30:38.020 --> 30:43.760
every time I see Xander I think of Buffy I think of drawn together I'm gonna

30:43.760 --> 30:47.680
never-ending quest to save my girlfriend forget it anyway moving on I don't watch

30:47.680 --> 30:53.240
TV oh you watch Buffy gotcha I watched Buffy because my friend taped it all

30:53.240 --> 30:58.440
right and we would watch it later mailbag mailbag um honestly what's okay

30:58.440 --> 31:01.320
says honestly I want to email you and say thanks for podcasting for the

31:01.320 --> 31:05.140
podcast because I'm not usually one to judge by reviews but with you guys I do

31:05.140 --> 31:09.260
I picked up a DS because you guys said they are awesome I picked up Animal

31:09.260 --> 31:12.920
Crossing DS and Mario Kart DS because of all the hype here about it I just

31:12.920 --> 31:16.560
picked up trace memory because the little plug for it on episode 170 and

31:16.560 --> 31:19.880
honestly I wanted to thank you guys for the show and how helpful you guys are

31:19.880 --> 31:24.160
wow that's that's amazing wow to know that we're actually influencing how

31:24.160 --> 31:27.040
people spend their hard-earned money that's that's a hell of a compliment

31:27.040 --> 31:32.720
thank you it's a little light in my dark soul I know that's great there's a light

31:32.720 --> 31:36.880
sorry you haven't you had me on musicals so forget it moving on

31:36.880 --> 31:40.600
Pendragon writes in and says

31:40.600 --> 31:43.800
this is support for a Loki's whole PC

31:43.800 --> 31:46.880
fetish. Oh, we have a Loki supporter! Yeah.

31:46.880 --> 31:51.840
Oh, you have to admit it's about time. We've heard the anti end of it

31:51.840 --> 31:53.760
so now we need to hear the pro end of it. We're fair.

31:53.760 --> 31:57.720
We're fair and balanced, Radio. It's not what it looks like, but how it

31:57.720 --> 32:00.600
actually works and performs. We'll see about the new Intel mechs. Honestly, this

32:00.600 --> 32:01.920
pretty interface looks

32:01.920 --> 32:06.320
will bog the system down and overall will not be as fast as the PC. I'm a 3D graphic artist

32:06.320 --> 32:09.920
and I wouldn't bother with the Mac. You want to know what, okay? You are obviously not

32:09.920 --> 32:16.920
a professional graphic artist, because just about any professional will use a Mac, and

32:16.920 --> 32:25.520
the Intel Macs are clocked to be much faster than their equivalent PC. Which is why I'm

32:25.520 --> 32:26.520
getting one!

32:26.520 --> 32:31.600
This PC Mac thing is so 2005. I'm done. I'm done.

32:31.600 --> 32:32.600
I can't wait until I get it.

32:32.600 --> 32:33.840
Stop sending emails on it. I don't care.

32:33.840 --> 32:41.840
I can't wait until I get started broadcasting from my Mac because now the new iLife 6 has instant podcast support.

32:41.840 --> 32:43.840
Will you be broadcasting in flavors?

32:43.840 --> 32:45.840
Yes, I will have a great...

32:45.840 --> 32:47.840
Stop! Stop egging this whole thing off!

32:47.840 --> 32:49.840
Just sit down and shut up and take it like a man!

32:49.840 --> 32:51.840
My show tastes like purple!

32:51.840 --> 32:53.840
Alright, next email!

32:53.840 --> 32:56.840
I'm going to podcast in a black like my soul flavor.

32:56.840 --> 33:03.660
okay um Raphael writes in and says I am going to try not to rant about this but

33:03.660 --> 33:07.980
here we go usually that means there's a rant following the one thing that I find

33:07.980 --> 33:11.980
very amusing is that religious people say how bad and evil video games are

33:11.980 --> 33:16.900
however they had even taken the smallest amount of time to read summaries of the

33:16.900 --> 33:21.780
game they would realize that the most games promote some of their morals such

33:21.780 --> 33:26.220
as friendship love peace tolerance etc just it just proves that most of this

33:26.220 --> 33:30.560
Most of the religious people in the media have blind, ignorant hate, which true Christians

33:30.560 --> 33:31.560
would frown upon.

33:31.560 --> 33:34.740
However, I would like to note that not all Christians are like this, and not all video

33:34.740 --> 33:39.360
games deserve to be defended, such as games with blood, gore, dot dot dot, though this

33:39.360 --> 33:43.460
is only my personal view, as I would rather play Animal Crossing than shoot someone and

33:43.460 --> 33:44.980
laugh as their stomach explode.

33:44.980 --> 33:49.220
Okay, again, I have a problem, and I'm sure the emailer didn't intend to do this, but

33:49.220 --> 33:53.820
I have a problem with the generalization of religious people, because you can be religious

33:53.820 --> 33:55.220
and not be a moron.

33:55.220 --> 33:59.160
easily possible I have many I know that I know but I'm just I just wanted to

33:59.160 --> 34:08.000
clarify as well but you know moving on moving on I'm sorry I was taking a

34:08.000 --> 34:10.800
moment to savor my caffeine I do appreciate the perspective though he's

34:10.800 --> 34:13.560
right you know because it makes me think of something and this has nothing to do

34:13.560 --> 34:17.520
with games but TV so dark soccer just tune out for a minute there was this

34:17.520 --> 34:22.880
show on TV recently called book of Daniel on NBC and it it got this huge

34:22.880 --> 34:28.280
huge flack from, you know, just the bad apples of the religious world that said, you know,

34:28.280 --> 34:29.940
it's sacrilegious and dah, dah, dah.

34:29.940 --> 34:33.780
But if you actually took time to watch the show, you'd see that it actually, it portrayed

34:33.780 --> 34:40.900
the flashes or whatever the guy was having of Jesus or whatever.

34:40.900 --> 34:45.860
Jesus was portrayed in a very, you know, moral light and had these very profound and pro-religious

34:45.860 --> 34:50.220
things to say that I thought were very provocative.

34:50.220 --> 34:54.600
And you could tell that people that were campaigning against this show had never watched an episode

34:54.600 --> 34:57.000
of it and just took what they saw at face value.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.360
And the show got pulled and cancelled.

34:58.360 --> 35:01.400
Yeah, I was going to say, it's funny you mentioned never watching the show because I think a

35:01.400 --> 35:04.000
lot of people never watched the show and so it got cancelled.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.680
So anyway, take that to video games and apply it.

35:06.680 --> 35:07.680
Anyway.

35:07.680 --> 35:13.160
It just goes to show the blind leading the, you know, brainless and blind.

35:13.160 --> 35:16.920
I got an email from one of our listeners,

35:16.920 --> 35:20.280
uh, Sithsmon.

35:20.280 --> 35:23.720
Actually, three bits to bring up. I'll go ahead and, uh,

35:23.720 --> 35:27.800
I'll paraphrase this a little bit, but I'll go ahead and read some of it. Interesting bit number one,

35:27.800 --> 35:32.280
you can now listen to OLR and the other podcasts if you have a TiVo and broadband connection.

35:32.280 --> 35:36.200
I heard about TiVo podcasts. That's so awesome. I would love to see

35:36.200 --> 35:39.600
our show on TiVo. Like, take a picture of your TV and send it, because I want to frame it.

35:39.600 --> 35:44.460
The article is located at publications.mediapost.com

35:44.460 --> 35:49.140
The URL is really long, so I'll just say look for it there

35:49.140 --> 35:55.200
He set OLR up and works great, even displays our logo on the TV

35:55.200 --> 35:56.700
Sweet, that's awesome

35:56.700 --> 35:59.820
Send us a picture, I want to see that. Yeah, I would really like to see a picture of that

35:59.820 --> 36:03.080
I have TiVo knock off on my TV, I have Comcast

36:03.080 --> 36:05.000
Not TiVo

36:05.000 --> 36:08.300
Interesting bit number two, not sure if you mentioned this yet, recently PC Gamer

36:08.300 --> 36:13.900
out that they will no longer use advertisements for items and gold farming services.

36:13.900 --> 36:19.460
The article is at www.next-gen.biz.

36:19.460 --> 36:23.560
Gamers that play MMOs just want to know what we think about that.

36:23.560 --> 36:26.540
He says his opinion is that this is a great idea.

36:26.540 --> 36:30.940
Not so much because it will put farmers out of business, but because it's a big statement

36:30.940 --> 36:34.260
that gamers are getting really sick of these game-ruining services.

36:34.260 --> 36:38.340
I heard about it, and I think we were considering it for inclusion in previous podcasts, but

36:38.340 --> 36:47.660
we were out of time, and I support the move, you know, and I don't know, I guess that's

36:47.660 --> 36:49.800
all I really have to say.

36:49.800 --> 36:54.300
There's also the last thing is that last week I got an email from Sony asking me to participate

36:54.300 --> 36:57.260
in a PSP beta for Seif and Fielder Dark Mirror.

36:57.260 --> 36:59.900
Basically go to a site, fill out a form, and they mail you a UMD.

36:59.900 --> 37:00.900
The catch?

37:00.900 --> 37:05.220
up using the PSP browser and you need the newest firmware, 2.6. I hit up the site about

37:05.220 --> 37:08.820
10 hours after I got the email and quickly got a message saying they already had all

37:08.820 --> 37:14.420
the beta participants they needed. The beta is full less than a day after the email, WTF.

37:14.420 --> 37:18.900
Couple things to touch on that. One, you didn't need the 2.6 firmware. You could spoof it

37:18.900 --> 37:24.380
and it's no problem. Two, it's not going to really matter anymore, which we'll cover later.

37:24.380 --> 37:25.380
Alright.

37:25.380 --> 37:29.980
Well, what do you think about that? It was a very limited beta. Knowing that thousands

37:29.980 --> 37:36.820
of gamers would try to update their PSP to 2.6 to sign up for a siphon filter game that's

37:36.820 --> 37:42.700
a lot there was also another beta that's going on right now actually for pursuit force which

37:42.700 --> 37:50.060
is going out to also people are members of the playstation.com of course they select

37:50.060 --> 37:57.380
a few of them that participate so all right any other emails there is actually one more

37:57.380 --> 38:02.980
Just because it needs to be said and also I do want to go in and thank Rob Way for the the

38:04.180 --> 38:06.180
article about the

38:06.700 --> 38:12.420
Game writing. Oh sweet from the first half of the show because he's the one who gave me that little bit of knowledge

38:15.500 --> 38:21.980
One of our writers John Blanco said that he didn't get bored of Nintendogs just recently acquired

38:21.980 --> 38:27.420
50,000 trainer points all dogs and interior decorations are now unlocked

38:27.420 --> 38:36.260
mwahahahahaha that's a quote well go on with your bad self you rock and your bad

38:36.260 --> 38:41.980
game hey I liked the puppies okay weren't you not here miklata when did

38:41.980 --> 38:45.700
you come back just appeared suddenly well I appeared suddenly with Starbucks

38:45.700 --> 38:48.460
oh yeah that's right that's how the coffee got my hand he appeared with

38:48.460 --> 38:49.460
crack.

38:49.460 --> 38:50.460
There you go.

38:50.460 --> 38:51.460
Mm-hmm.

38:51.460 --> 38:52.460
I'm almost out.

38:52.460 --> 38:53.460
I'll have you know Taco.

38:53.460 --> 38:54.460
But we remember what Foamy has to say about this.

38:54.460 --> 38:59.100
Taco is in the to-be-sold pile for GameStop right now.

38:59.100 --> 39:07.260
So is Ayn, Minchi, and my Dalmatian, who I forgot what I named.

39:07.260 --> 39:09.780
Alright, so that's it for the emails?

39:09.780 --> 39:10.780
Yep.

39:10.780 --> 39:14.820
Send your emails to mailbag at orangelaunsradio.com and we try to read, we definitely read them

39:14.820 --> 39:19.420
all, try to respond to them all, and read as many as we can in any given week.

39:19.420 --> 39:20.420
So we love getting emails.

39:20.420 --> 39:21.420
I've got a ton.

39:21.420 --> 39:22.420
It inflates our egos and makes us feel loved.

39:22.420 --> 39:23.420
I don't mind.

39:23.420 --> 39:25.420
I will take the top six.

39:25.420 --> 39:29.420
Alright, moving on, we're running way over tonight.

39:29.420 --> 39:33.780
Our first thing went on for 90 minutes, we're going to try and lightning round through the

39:33.780 --> 39:35.180
last few articles we have here tonight.

39:35.180 --> 39:37.980
We've got a lot, but we still want to talk about stuff.

39:37.980 --> 39:41.420
One person who we can't seem to avoid a story on every week is Yui Bol.

39:41.420 --> 39:43.700
Loki, what the hell is he doing now?

39:43.700 --> 39:50.980
more of what he's not doing. What he's not doing is working on Metal Gear Solid. So that's

39:50.980 --> 39:58.300
always good. He says, look, I'm super busy right now. I can only do three movies in two

39:58.300 --> 40:04.340
years. So earlier I said I could do Hitman or Metal Gear Solid before 2007. Not that

40:04.340 --> 40:08.980
they would give you the rights to it anyways, you jackass. So, you know, he's not doing

40:08.980 --> 40:12.840
it and his next piece of crap that's coming out is done or is in the name of

40:12.840 --> 40:17.580
King dungeon sees movie better known as we ripped off Lord of the Rings for the

40:17.580 --> 40:23.140
entire thing and it sucks look for that coming in November oh in two parts by

40:23.140 --> 40:31.780
the way oh and what what's he made on a blood rain so far not jack $20 so you

40:31.780 --> 40:37.780
know hopefully these these studios will learn so yeah I'm very happy to hear

40:37.780 --> 40:42.160
about that so hooray and there is hope after all for the Metal Gear Solid movie

40:42.160 --> 40:46.440
so you know actually I think I think that news just made it because no we're

40:46.440 --> 40:49.320
on a little bit of delay on the stream here that news just made it over to our

40:49.320 --> 40:57.120
chat room that's right all right moving on we talked a lot about DDR earlier in

40:57.120 --> 41:02.440
the show West Virginia who knew that West Virginia still made the news once

41:02.440 --> 41:07.120
in a while I'm teasing I'm teasing West Virginia actually they had a partnership

41:07.120 --> 41:14.840
with Konami to put Dance Dance Revolution in 753 public schools that

41:14.840 --> 41:18.640
will be all of them within the next three years it was a pilot project that

41:18.640 --> 41:22.620
started last spring and they're actually going to incorporate it into schools I

41:22.620 --> 41:27.560
think that's kind of interesting so and that's being helped funded by Konami as

41:27.560 --> 41:31.440
well as you know all the usual grants and stuff so they're playing ultra mix I

41:31.440 --> 41:34.640
don't know which one by now they're doing ultra yeah in the little of this

41:34.640 --> 41:38.760
clip here you can see on yahoo news where I pulled it from actually this

41:38.760 --> 41:42.560
particular one they're playing extreme well that's a lie when they actually

41:42.560 --> 41:48.680
play it because it's ultra mix all right let's see why are they doing this here

41:48.680 --> 41:53.280
health promotions manager Nydia Henderson manager for the public

41:53.280 --> 41:57.440
employees insurance program says one out of three children born in West Virginia

41:57.440 --> 42:00.440
today will have diabetes by the time they grow up this is devastating

42:00.440 --> 42:03.720
statistic and not acceptable so essentially they're trying to make

42:03.720 --> 42:09.280
fitness fun and get kids into it via DDR which I think is pretty awesome and to

42:09.280 --> 42:13.560
make people not afraid of West Virginia. I remember what I said earlier about

42:13.560 --> 42:19.060
obesity being basically pandemic you know I applaud their efforts in trying

42:19.060 --> 42:22.500
to get kids active. I tried to be a little bit of a fly on the wall at

42:22.500 --> 42:25.540
Konami's gamer day and I picked up a little interesting tidbit all I can say

42:25.540 --> 42:29.420
is this won't be the last of it that you hear this won't be the last. You know a lot of

42:29.420 --> 42:32.980
independent schools in California are doing the same just on their own just

42:32.980 --> 42:34.980
buying the machine and making it part of their gym program.

42:34.980 --> 42:37.980
Why can't I know this stuff and I work for Konami?

42:37.980 --> 42:41.980
Because they keep you locked away in a cabinet, slaving away on...

42:41.980 --> 42:43.980
Whatever game I'm on at the time.

42:43.980 --> 42:44.980
I know, I can't say.

42:44.980 --> 42:49.980
It doesn't matter, even if you did know it, you'd be under some sort of NDA, so...

42:49.980 --> 42:51.980
At least I would know!

42:51.980 --> 42:53.980
That's the important part.

42:53.980 --> 42:56.980
That's pretty sad that a Konami employee is getting filled in here on our program.

42:56.980 --> 42:57.980
Yeah.

42:57.980 --> 43:00.980
I didn't get to go to Gamers' Day, even. I had to work.

43:00.980 --> 43:03.120
You missed our whole coverage too, you were out at the coffee...

43:03.120 --> 43:06.120
Starbucks, Gamers' Day coverage, come on.

43:06.120 --> 43:10.880
Alright. Moving on, let's talk about another music-based game. This one is an MMO.

43:10.880 --> 43:11.720
What the hell, Loki?

43:11.720 --> 43:15.200
Yeah, it's actually, of course, yet another

43:15.200 --> 43:19.560
great MMO coming from Koreans. It's actually called

43:19.560 --> 43:22.560
Dance Audition, and it's

43:22.560 --> 43:26.400
pretty sweet, really hard from what I hear, because I have yet to play it,

43:26.400 --> 43:33.400
unfortunately. But basically it kind of resembles a Space Channel 5 type of game where you match

43:33.580 --> 43:40.580
the movements on the screen. Choo! Choo! Choo! Anyways, so it includes, you know, they have

43:42.520 --> 43:47.020
different things. It's also kind of got a little bit of ode to jam type of feel to it

43:47.020 --> 43:51.900
where you can, you know, soup up your avatars with different items that you win by earning

43:51.900 --> 43:55.980
credits and stuff and learn new moves, songs, etc.

43:55.980 --> 43:59.480
If you want to check this out, they're actually doing a free beta on it right now.

43:59.480 --> 44:03.480
It's au.bugsgames.net.

44:03.480 --> 44:06.300
I want to say that was headlined on our site earlier this week, so it should have a link

44:06.300 --> 44:07.300
there too.

44:07.300 --> 44:08.300
orangehomesradio.com.

44:08.300 --> 44:11.300
Much easier to remember.

44:11.300 --> 44:15.420
Alright, now audition something that can be played worldwide, yes?

44:15.420 --> 44:16.420
Yes.

44:16.420 --> 44:18.300
So that would include our friends in the UK.

44:18.300 --> 44:22.720
however you do want to have Internet Explorer for you know signing up on the

44:22.720 --> 44:27.160
site and everything because it only works in Internet Explorer. Worst game ever. No love

44:27.160 --> 44:31.920
for Firefox. Worst game ever. Alright anyway I was trying to do a segue into the UK

44:31.920 --> 44:36.120
news that you completely interrupted so uh. Sorry. Dark Sakura. My segue's ruined.

44:36.120 --> 44:42.760
UK news. What's up in the UK? Lots of stuff. First off there is a crash day demo

44:42.760 --> 44:52.140
from Atari put out for PC PS2 and Xbox and the download is actually up on

44:52.140 --> 44:57.040
Eurogamer if you go to their home page there's a link to the demo I love

44:57.040 --> 45:03.680
Eurogamer but basically the game is a combination of racing stunts and big ol

45:03.680 --> 45:08.560
weapons so you can make big I like the quote here big smashy messes and design

45:08.560 --> 45:12.720
your own tracks demo includes a wrecking match event and a stunt show event and

45:12.720 --> 45:17.080
And you can even try out the multiplayer mode via either LAN or internet.

45:17.080 --> 45:21.120
You can only launch the demo 50 times though, so be warned.

45:21.120 --> 45:25.520
The official release date is February 24th.

45:25.520 --> 45:31.760
Also for our listeners in Australia, we never forget you guys.

45:31.760 --> 45:33.680
The Xbox 360 has been delayed.

45:33.680 --> 45:38.480
We have some in chat right now too, and it's gotta be a crazy hour over there right now,

45:38.480 --> 45:39.480
so...

45:39.480 --> 45:40.480
It's something in the morning, isn't it?

45:40.480 --> 45:45.400
you early early birds in Australia tuning in love ya thank you for hanging

45:45.400 --> 45:52.840
out with us and the console was supposed to launch on March 2nd the date has been

45:52.840 --> 45:58.960
delayed to March 23rd Microsoft said that the slip-up was due to and I quote

45:58.960 --> 46:03.320
unprecedented global consumer demand in short-term manufacturing issues due to

46:03.320 --> 46:06.960
component shortages stemming from challenges in rampant supplies meaning

46:06.960 --> 46:13.400
Also, according to Microsoft, the launch date ensures that the markets will have an adequate

46:13.400 --> 46:18.060
supply of Xbox 360 consoles to meet demand at launch, so maybe they're trying to learn

46:18.060 --> 46:20.960
from their little mess-up with us.

46:20.960 --> 46:24.760
Just to clarify, Deke Mann, who's our friend down under in chat right now, says it's actually

46:24.760 --> 46:29.600
only 3 p.m. over there, so that's not too bad.

46:29.600 --> 46:37.320
They also though expect to sell between 4.5 million and 5.5 million units by July.

46:37.320 --> 46:44.420
Also there was the mention too that demand is completely overpowering supply everywhere.

46:44.420 --> 46:49.920
Microsoft said that they've lowered their 90 day sales forecast.

46:49.920 --> 46:52.920
So yeah, they got a little bit ahead of themselves, huh?

46:52.920 --> 46:54.880
Does everywhere not include Japan anymore?

46:54.880 --> 46:57.200
Japan, they've only sold 100,000.

46:57.200 --> 46:58.200
Yeah.

46:58.200 --> 47:01.280
yeah that's not surprising also

47:01.280 --> 47:05.640
you know I'm sure people who know me know I have a lot of love for SNK

47:05.640 --> 47:09.380
I have a Neo Geo I have versions of

47:09.380 --> 47:12.720
I have King of Fighters the fact that you bought a Neo Geo is hardcore right there

47:12.720 --> 47:15.600
actually my my husband traded a Sega CD for it

47:15.600 --> 47:19.360
and now we have another Sega CD

47:19.360 --> 47:23.720
but this was a while back

47:23.720 --> 47:27.320
Xbox

47:27.320 --> 47:33.880
is getting KOF Neowave which is basically the same three on three

47:33.880 --> 47:38.600
you know fighting team you have twelve three person teams you've also got

47:38.600 --> 47:42.040
you know included are the women's teams with my King and Yuri

47:42.040 --> 47:45.220
the Fatal Fury team with Terry Joe and Andy

47:45.220 --> 47:49.380
you've got a tournament mode there's also three modes of play

47:49.380 --> 47:53.900
I don't really get what these are they're super cancel guard break and max 2

47:53.900 --> 47:58.340
excuse me, plus a new heat mode that lets you power up attacks in exchange for

47:58.340 --> 48:00.020
gradual loss of health.

48:00.020 --> 48:03.500
Also there's screenshots up on Eurogamer so you might want to check them out.

48:03.500 --> 48:07.860
Also mention if you are a King of Fighters fan, King of Fighters

48:07.860 --> 48:11.900
94 Rebound came out a couple weeks ago actually

48:11.900 --> 48:15.420
for the Xbox as well. I've got KOF

48:15.420 --> 48:18.500
95 on Saturn where you have

48:18.500 --> 48:22.860
if you've got a US Saturn you have to do this thing where you put in your loading cart

48:22.860 --> 48:26.140
change output in the RAM cart real quick. One of the, I think, three

48:26.140 --> 48:30.700
Saturn games that runs on a RAM cart. Half the game is on cartridge, which doesn't

48:30.700 --> 48:31.820
help the load time any anyway.

48:31.820 --> 48:36.380
Um, also release dates. I actually have two sets of release dates.

48:36.380 --> 48:40.580
Um, we have our, uh, UK release dates and Australian release dates.

48:40.580 --> 48:44.540

I don't know all right anyway moving on let's let's go over to Loki who has some

50:57.140 --> 51:02.180
news about the PSP yeah actually earlier I was going to cover that they had

51:02.180 --> 51:11.520
figured out how to load all homebrew for versions 2.01 and 2.5. They were 90% done earlier today

51:11.520 --> 51:15.220
with getting 2.6 to work and apparently while we were doing this show they had already broke

51:15.220 --> 51:20.820
the news that they've cracked, no, figured it out for 2.6. So now every version currently

51:20.820 --> 51:28.720
of the PSP can run homebrew. Now these latest ones, everything from 2.01 up to 2.6 require

51:28.720 --> 51:36.560
Grand Theft Auto using it, the glitch or hack that was with the save files to load an e-boot

51:36.560 --> 51:37.560
loader.

51:37.560 --> 51:39.520
And that's kind of how everything is working right now.

51:39.520 --> 51:42.780
Some programs are working, some aren't.

51:42.780 --> 51:46.060
So if you don't have Grand Theft Auto and aren't planning to get one, you probably should

51:46.060 --> 51:49.920
not think twice about upgrading to 2.6.

51:49.920 --> 51:55.920
However, new games that are coming out right now will require you to upgrade to 2.5 at

51:55.920 --> 52:01.800
least, and some I hear are actually 2.6 now, so something to think about.

52:01.800 --> 52:04.360
That's all late-breaking ass we're taping right now.

52:04.360 --> 52:05.560
Yeah, pretty much, yeah.

52:05.560 --> 52:08.720
So you can find that stuff on PSP updates.

52:08.720 --> 52:13.640
Deepin pointed out that the 2.6 was done, so that was kind of cool.

52:13.640 --> 52:14.640
Awesome.

52:14.640 --> 52:16.900
All right, moving on, let's go to another topic here.

52:16.900 --> 52:20.520
This is something completely different, you know, I like to browse the various gaming

52:20.520 --> 52:23.920
websites out there, kind of seeing what's popular, and one of them I scan on a regular

52:23.920 --> 52:31.800
basis is Joystiq. Joystiq had a story this week about a gallery of video game endings

52:31.800 --> 52:37.240
and it's mostly for classic 8 and 16-bit game endings. You can actually check it out. It's

52:37.240 --> 52:43.000
the Video Game Museum at VGmuseum.com and they mention in this story a lot of endings.

52:43.000 --> 52:48.680
Sonic the Hedgehog, What Happens If You Never Were Able to Beat Strider, and of course games

52:48.680 --> 52:53.480
that we all remember such as Metroid and things like that. I thought I'd bring that up here

52:53.480 --> 52:59.540
in studio, what video game endings do you remember that are so memorable that you love?

52:59.540 --> 53:00.540
Dark Sakura.

53:00.540 --> 53:05.540
Ryu's ending on Super Street Fighter II with him just walking and the music playing.

53:05.540 --> 53:07.100
Street Fighter II had some good endings, it did.

53:07.100 --> 53:09.740
It was cool how every character kind of had a different one.

53:09.740 --> 53:15.080
I remember how slow it was, you know Street Fighter Alpha 2 came out on the Super Nintendo.

53:15.080 --> 53:20.720
Only cartridge I had played with loading time, excuse me, and it was like the scenery would

53:20.720 --> 53:21.720
pop up.

53:21.720 --> 53:27.200
Yeah, you kind of need them to play don't you but I actually got my first screenshots for my old website

53:27.480 --> 53:32.040
Dark soccer is mostly evil shrine from the Super Nintendo. I think I've been to that website

53:32.800 --> 53:34.800
That was still up. It's gone

53:35.760 --> 53:41.120
Geo cities finally deleted it. You need to have a spin-off of orange. I've saved the pages. There you go

53:41.120 --> 53:45.800
We should put it up for nostalgia value. We'll put it up. All right, it's with with its background MIDI's and all

53:45.800 --> 53:51.800
Yeah, it was crappy. But I hand coded it. I hand coded my sites back then.

53:51.800 --> 53:54.800
Other great endings. Loki, Miklotov, anything you want to add?

53:54.800 --> 53:58.800
Personally, I liked the ending of Final Fantasy VIII. I don't know.

53:58.800 --> 54:01.800
A lot of people didn't like that game. I thought it was pretty good.

54:01.800 --> 54:04.800
The ending was cool with selfie and the camera.

54:04.800 --> 54:07.800
Final Fantasy IX, though. That game sucked.

54:07.800 --> 54:08.800
Miklotov?

54:08.800 --> 54:13.800
Silent Hill 2. So sad and depressing. I loved it.

54:13.800 --> 54:14.800
Which ending?

54:14.800 --> 54:17.880
the one I consider to be the true ending the dog inning right

54:17.880 --> 54:21.720
no believe ending yeah yeah the one I saw

54:21.720 --> 54:25.120
the with the with the letter at the end yeah yeah that all

54:25.120 --> 54:28.520
because there's also the I hate myself and when I went yeah

54:28.520 --> 54:32.620
there's the one where he does die the one where other things happen

54:32.620 --> 54:35.880
I don't do spoilers nevermind I

54:35.880 --> 54:39.120
anything else you want to add there's a couple that writer mm-hmm

54:39.120 --> 54:42.120
I have actually beaten Strider hardcore

54:42.120 --> 54:46.120
any given Mega Man game. Yes. Especially two, I remember that.

54:46.120 --> 54:50.920
Games I remember, especially from the 8-bit days, Super Mario Brothers 2,

54:50.920 --> 54:54.520
the Dallas OMG it was all a dream thing.

54:54.520 --> 54:57.920
Who can forget that one? Of course Metroid, classic there.

54:57.920 --> 55:01.280
I think my favorite though would be Final Fantasy IV, Final Fantasy II on

55:01.280 --> 55:02.460
Super Nintendo in the US.

55:02.460 --> 55:06.240
Classic. I love it. I loved it. Someone, why are you shaking your hand at that?

55:06.240 --> 55:09.840
I loved it. Because I just recently played it again on the Game Boy Advance.

55:09.840 --> 55:16.560
And it was okay the one for Final Fantasy 6 was really good, but you have to wait for a shadow to live

55:18.120 --> 55:23.520
Let's see I'm looking at the chat chat room over at orange launch radio.com click on chat and seeing what they're saying in here

55:25.880 --> 55:28.200
PK Akira 88 says act razor

55:28.960 --> 55:30.640
That's a good one

55:30.640 --> 55:34.000
SSJ 100 Matt chrono trigger which anything and yeah

55:34.560 --> 55:37.800
It's done follow that up with well. It has what like 25 endings

55:37.800 --> 55:42.800
Let's see, and VXChase and XV says, stop spoiling Silent Hill 2.

55:42.800 --> 55:44.800
Haha, whatever.

55:44.800 --> 55:48.800
Actually, I have to say that my favorite of the Chrono Trigger endings is, okay,

55:48.800 --> 55:51.800
after you have become sufficient enough level where you do New Game Plus,

55:51.800 --> 55:56.800
and you beat the game immediately upon setting onto the teleporter,

55:56.800 --> 56:00.800
you get the designer ending where they each leave you a comment

56:00.800 --> 56:02.800
and one of the people you meet is Toriyama.

56:02.800 --> 56:06.800
Wasn't one of the endings where the girls would rate the guys in the game?

56:06.800 --> 56:10.800
I don't think I got that one. I did get the one where

56:11.920 --> 56:15.860
They did something before they got frog in the party and frog ended up being

56:16.720 --> 56:23.260
Marvel's ancestor and she started croaking. Yeah, that's such good ending. Let's see. I'm looking at some other ones here

56:23.260 --> 56:27.520
We've got Dark Knight yelling for a Shenmue. No, cuz it's a horrible game

56:28.040 --> 56:30.800
poof aces half-life 2 because the cliffhanger and

56:30.800 --> 56:35.340
and let's see, somebody said, oh Pooface also said Halo 2 is the worst ending

56:35.340 --> 56:38.600
MiniMe283 says Zelda Ocarina of Time

56:38.600 --> 56:42.360
Yeah, that had a good ending. Good stuff, good stuff you guys

56:42.360 --> 56:45.840
Alright, let's go ahead and move on again if you want to check out that website with

56:45.840 --> 56:46.600
classic

56:46.600 --> 56:49.800
not everything in there is considered classic so you may not find them all

56:49.800 --> 56:53.440
VGMuseum.com though for the classic 8 and 16 bit ones

56:53.440 --> 56:57.440
No, no, no, one more. What? The Guardian Legend. Shit yeah

56:57.440 --> 56:58.960
Yeah

56:58.960 --> 57:04.440
Loki what's going on with Street Fighter? We brought up Street Fighter in the ending stuff. What's going on with the Street Fighter now?

57:04.440 --> 57:06.160
Well, as you remember

57:06.160 --> 57:11.600
Was Street Fighter had a collection for it now, they have the Street Fighter alpha collection

57:12.200 --> 57:15.880
Which is gonna feature all of these Street Fighter alpha games including

57:16.880 --> 57:19.560
puzzle or not puzzle fighter super gem fighter

57:21.160 --> 57:23.160
Which is gonna be pretty sweet as well

57:23.160 --> 57:35.160
They're basically going to also have the survival mode as well as a dramatic battle which allows two-on-one tag team matches.

57:35.160 --> 57:41.160
And I believe, I'm trying to remember if they added anything else in there.

57:41.160 --> 57:45.160
I think overall it's going to be a pretty cool collection of games.

57:45.160 --> 57:57.160
They've also got the Capcom Classic Collection coming out to the PSP pretty soon with a lot of cool games on there.

57:58.160 --> 58:02.160
You know what you need to put on one of those anthologies? Cyberbots.

58:03.160 --> 58:05.160
That would be interesting.

58:06.160 --> 58:08.160
Alright, what's going on with Splinter Cell, Loki?

58:09.160 --> 58:13.160
Splinter Cell? Well, Splinter Cell Essentials is still coming out in March.

58:13.160 --> 58:20.400
However, Splinter Cell Double Agent is postponed to September.

58:20.400 --> 58:25.140
Much like they did with Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, they're tweaking the game to make

58:25.140 --> 58:31.720
sure it's perfect, and they're worried right now that the installed base of Xbox 360 owners

58:31.720 --> 58:37.000
might not be what they're hoping for if they release in March.

58:37.000 --> 58:41.780
In other words, Microsoft hasn't sold enough systems to the United States yet.

58:41.780 --> 58:45.240
So they are postponing it to September to make sure that they have enough systems out

58:45.240 --> 58:50.180
there to make this game still like crazy, because it's going to be probably a must-have

58:50.180 --> 58:51.180
game.

58:51.180 --> 58:54.080
So, look forward in September.

58:54.080 --> 58:59.140
A must-have game on the PSP in some folks' opinion is the new Katamari Damacy that's

58:59.140 --> 59:00.820
going to be coming out on PSP.

59:00.820 --> 59:03.980
For those of you guys that are looking for something in the meantime to hold you over,

59:03.980 --> 59:07.300
Dark Sakura, do you have a little something, a little collector's item for Katamari Damacy?

59:07.300 --> 59:08.300
Kind of?

59:08.300 --> 59:09.940
They've made Katamari Damacy checks!

59:09.940 --> 59:10.940
They are custom checks.

59:10.940 --> 59:11.940
They are so cute.

59:11.940 --> 59:12.940
I want some.

59:12.940 --> 59:13.940
To pay the rent type checks?

59:13.940 --> 59:14.940
Yes.

59:14.940 --> 59:15.940
To pay the rent type checks.

59:15.940 --> 59:23.940
They are custom checks that have, hello, I am a check, please cash me, lol, Katamari,

59:23.940 --> 59:25.940
do your best.

59:25.940 --> 59:30.460
Because they have these custom check making services, so somebody just created Katamari

59:30.460 --> 59:31.460
checks?

59:31.460 --> 59:33.580
I suppose so.

59:33.580 --> 59:37.460
It says on there, there is a quote that says, I design them, when you spend money, people

59:37.460 --> 59:39.260
should feel happy and also super lucky.

59:39.260 --> 59:44.140
This is the most important thing to be contributing to the success for every special day. Do not chase waterfalls

59:45.740 --> 59:50.660
PK Akira 88 in our chat room says now I can bounce a check in style. Yeah, you can

59:51.940 --> 59:56.060
You can roll up overdraft fees to who knew that Katamari's bounced

59:58.220 --> 01:00:01.300
All right, we're just got a couple more stories left for you guys

01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:06.980
We are going to take just a couple quick skype line calls right after this so you can call us on our skype line

01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:12.140
www.orangelaunchradio.com, click on interact with us, or you can also call us over the

01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:17.220
regular telephone line, however, please remember it is not an 800 number, so if you're not

01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:20.380
the person that owns the phone line, you need to get somebody's permission before you call

01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:24.200
the number 916-226-9067.

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:28.140
Real quick, I got a story for you guys though, I know we're running a long time, but I just

01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:29.920
want to bring this up real quick.

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:35.220
Another story coming out of West Virginia, a study by researchers at Wheeling Jesuit

01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:38.860
University the story coming from Gama Sutra or Game Sutra I don't know however

01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:41.380
you want to pronounce that I like Gama Sutra because it makes it sound dirty

01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:46.340
it's a study called the effects of video game play types on pain threshold and

01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:51.020
tolerance interesting the study compared several different genres of games and

01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:55.420
their effects on pain they used action puzzle arcade fighting sports and boxing

01:00:55.420 --> 01:01:00.020
games things that encourage high attention and stimulus the researchers

01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:05.780
also measured the emotional response to each type. He concluded Dr. Brian

01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:10.380
Radenbush, the director of undergraduate research, says physicians could possibly

01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:14.700
implement this in their office to aid in distraction during a painful procedure

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:18.460
such as injection or dental work. Video games could also be used in waiting

01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:22.780
rooms to distract patients from upcoming surgical procedures. This principle, by

01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:26.260
the way, is one of the driving forces behind child's play, which we talked

01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:29.700
about earlier in the program, the drive to donate games to Children's Hospital

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:35.820
awards very interesting there I'm assuming that the Nintendo DS version of

01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:40.140
under the knife is not one of those games probably not probably not what do

01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:43.980
you think is this is this legitimate I I've heard of this video games being

01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:46.940
used in Dennis office before to distract people I think it's a great idea my

01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:51.460
dentist has CNN and it's distracting enough you know to kind of keep my mind

01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:59.100
off of this isn't new I remember being about 13 years old watching something on

01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:02.600
on the news program where they were using light hypnosis

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:04.360
to uh...

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:09.220
have people go into a dental surgery without anesthesia

01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:11.320
uh... they had like a track

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:13.220
they were actually testing it out with little children

01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:14.940
having them follow it and saying hey

01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:17.460
you know follow the rabbit with your eyes see where it ends up

01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:20.300
by the time the light would hit the end of the track their surgery should be

01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:23.820
done

01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:24.900
interesting

01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:29.940
I had a few things to follow up with, a few more stories real quick.

01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:32.340
Just mainly Xbox Live stuff right now.

01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:38.840
There's going to be an update to the Xbox Live for Call of Duty 2.

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:41.900
They're going to have a multiplayer update that's going to be happening I think Monday

01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:43.280
or Tuesday.

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:48.340
And also there's going to be an update for the dashboard which was going to add that

01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:51.060
feature for webcams and whatnot.

01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:53.320
So that's going to be coming pretty soon here.

01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:58.760
Also last week there was a couple things added to the Xbox Live Arcade, Marble Blast Ultra

01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:02.560
brand new game coming out, it's kind of like your Marble Madness type of game.

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:08.280
And then of course the demo for Full Auto hit last week.

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:12.680
So if you don't have that yet, you need to download it, because it's awesome.

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:17.420
Alright, let's go over the Skype line and see what you guys want to add tonight.

01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:21.980
Of course remember www.orangelaunchrater.com, click on interact with us and you can get

01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:26.500
All the details on how to call us via the skype line such as this person is doing right now. Hello

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:33.220
You're on orange lounge radio. Hi. What's up? Hi. Who's this is Anna from Florida. Hello, Xander from Florida

01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:35.700
Who's on a never-ending quest to save his girlfriend, right?

01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:38.740
I'm just messing with you. What's up?

01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:46.040
You forgot to mention Iko on the game endings. I know I saw you guys shouting that in chat and I totally forgot Iko

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:50.480
Okay, there you hit now you said it. There it is. I go. Yay. All right. Is that all you want to say?

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:58.760
I don't think so. Okay. Well, what else do you want to say then? We're running low on time. What's on your mind?

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:05.240
DDR supernova is underwhelming but was in the groove

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:11.360
Was waiting to bounce that can't we all just get along? Oh, oh

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:17.760
Oh, you know what? Haven't we done enough controversial topics on this show? Did you

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:22.440
have to delve into the DDR versus ITG thing? Come on. Can you agree that Pump It Up is

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:27.880
good though? Can you agree that Pump It Up is good? Yes. Okay, then we can talk about

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:37.320
that and be happy. But no ITG DDR. All right, Xander. Xander, I'm letting you go because

01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:40.520
you're trying to start fights. But have a good one. Thanks for calling. I'm just joking

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:42.520
I know you are take care Xander

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:48.800
Okay, speaking of which pump it up zero ships the US arcades February 1st. Heck. Yeah, Dave and Busters. I gotta be there

01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:51.220
Hello, you're on orange lounge radio

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Hey, what's up? Hi

01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:57.480
Hi

01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:04.660
first-time caller, long-time listener, radio, whatever, am I breaking up to you guys?

01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:07.440
You are breaking up a little bit, but go ahead and get your question out and we'll answer

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:08.440
it.

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:10.620
I have a question.

01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:19.640
I think I can explain this video games, like taking away the pain, like that article you

01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:23.580
guys are talking about on 1UP or whatever you found.

01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:30.580
So when you're playing a video game, if you're focused enough on it, it has to be a certain

01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:35.740
type of video game in which you're constantly focused or else you're going to lose.

01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:40.560
Something like WarioWare would be most effective for it because the game completely changes

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:42.240
every five seconds.

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:44.460
If you're not totally focused on it, you're going to die.

01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:51.180
And if you're focused on something else, then wow, we get some feedback here.

01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:52.180
It's kind of distracting.

01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:58.100
That's alright, that's alright, you are cracking up a little bit there, I gotta go ahead and

01:05:58.100 --> 01:06:01.300
let you go buddy, but thanks for the call, appreciate it, and your perspective there

01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:07.620
on the pain management story there, and talking about a game like WarioWare would be most

01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:10.900
effective because it's, you know, kind of like in little, it really holds your attention

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:13.820
because you really have to pay attention to that game because it's throwing all these

01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:17.580
random things at you, so that makes sense, and I think that's why they only use certain

01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:21.420
types of games in the study too, to kind of show which ones would be the most effective,

01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:23.260
and not Trauma Center under the knife,

01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:24.500
because that would not be a good choice.

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:26.000
Ah, what are they doing to me?

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.660
Hahaha, alright, thank you guys so much

01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:31.780
for your calls on Skype, we gotta keep it short tonight,

01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:34.580
I'm very, very sorry, but we are like so out of time,

01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:38.180
you guys, but we do have one more thing for you guys.

01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:40.140
How could we forget our newest segment here

01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:41.780
on Orange Lounge Radio?

01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:44.520
Dark Sakura's Website of the Week.

01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:47.020
["Dark Sakura"]

01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:49.220
Dark Sakura, what's the website of the week this week?

01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:51.220
The Oregon Trail Online.

01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:56.180
I'm actually I'm wearing my you have died of dysentery shirt right now. I need a life journal like my dad saw it

01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:57.660
It's cute

01:06:57.660 --> 01:06:59.820
Just to read the first paragraph of this page

01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:02.880
Remember the old Oregon Trail used to play as a kid

01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:08.040
Well, we took the best part of the old Oregon Trail the hunting and turned it into the new age 3d hunting game

01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:14.300
Our game is packed with squirrels deer and Buffalo the game contains changing scenery and moving clouds

01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:16.800
There's even a trade function so you can purchase more bullets

01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:19.540
this was made with

01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:25.380
Macromedia director 10 the models are made using 3ds max 5.1. They actually put up all their stuff on there

01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:27.780
Textures were done in photoshop 7

01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:29.780
um

01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:32.980
I I actually I think it's pretty cool that they put up what they did behind us

01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:35.060
It's just you know for fans of the game

01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:38.580
Honestly, I tried to play it and it was a little eh to me

01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:40.740
But I still think the concept is cool

01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:45.300
And i'm glad that someone has recognized the importance of oregon trail to our gaming heritage

01:07:45.300 --> 01:08:06.300
This is located at Woz.comtechlab.msu.edu slash courses slash 447SP04 slash Oregon Trail.

01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:11.300
Post that in chat and post it on the forum so our listeners can find it.

01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:12.300
Good timing.

01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:13.300
You timed that right at the end of the song.

01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:19.100
I am so great radio high-five. Oh, right. I'm not a radio loser. We could we could do this for real

01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:26.020
All right, that's it that's the end of show my gosh you guys we did I think about three hours worth the show tonight

01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:28.060
Just under three hours worth the regular show. Oh

01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:32.100
Busy show controversial show emails

01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:36.940
But smoking is bad and I don't smoke. That's right. All right moving on

01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:40.180
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought me Glattov. Thank you for being here

01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:42.380
or at least the small portion of the show you were here.

01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:43.220
I appreciate it.

01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:44.040
You're welcome.

01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:44.880
Your final thought?

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:45.820
I don't have one.

01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:47.340
Loki, your final thought?

01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:53.380
I gotta get home to watch some ripped copies

01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:55.240
of the new family guy.

01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:56.580
Hopefully a new family guy.

01:08:56.580 --> 01:08:58.060
There better be a new family guy.

01:08:58.060 --> 01:08:59.660
My final thought is,

01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:02.340
what is up with those World of Warcraft style Google Maps?

01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:04.900
Some people have way too much free time on their hands.

01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:06.460
That was an article that did make the cut tonight,

01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:07.540
but it's interesting.

01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:09.380
We talked enough wow tonight.

01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:10.680
Dark Sakura, your final thought.

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:12.600
I have to go home and doctor my resume

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:14.000
because I have an interview tomorrow.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:14.920
Ooh, good luck with that.

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:16.280
And I'm a vegetarian now.

01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:19.920
Warlord of the Universe is the position

01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:20.840
you're applying for, or what?

01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:23.000
You know, I've been doing this job already.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.640
I may as well have the official title, you know?

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:28.960
All right, that's it, you guys.

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:31.320
Thanks so much for tuning in and listening to us this week,

01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:32.720
and we'll be back next week.

01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:35.140
Next week on the program, no special guests yet,

01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:37.340
but we are trying to get someone on the show next week,

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:38.360
so I don't wanna say who just yet,

01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:42.440
But we're trying to get someone very closely connected with the Silent Hill franchise.

01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:46.380
We're excited to get that person on, so we'll see if we get that.

01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:47.380
It's me!

01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:48.380
No, it's not.

01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:49.380
No, it's not.

01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:50.380
All right, and that's it.

01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:54.840
So stay tuned for that, and of course all the controversy and humor that you've come

01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:57.560
to expect from your buddies here at Orange Lounge.

01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:59.200
Until next week, have a good one!

01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:00.200
