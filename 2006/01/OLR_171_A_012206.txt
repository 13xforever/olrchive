Tonight, January 22nd, 2006, is the Gizmondo and Mondo Trouble.
A new Silent Hill trailer hits the net and has everyone buzzing, and we talk about the worst reviewed video games of all time.
Welcome everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
This is episode number 171.
For this, January the 22nd, 2006, we're here to talk about video games and what gamers really want to know about.
And of course, you know our old catchphrase, the video games that don't suck, but sometimes we have to tell you about the ones that do suck just to tell you to stay away from them.
My name is Rob Roberts.
You might know me as Sky.
Joining me as always are my lovely co-hosts.
Say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
Oh, your mic's off, dear.
Now it isn't.
There we go.
I can't find the ferret.
Oh, there he is.
I've decided the name of the ferret.
Our mascot ferret, which we've had for the past three and a half years now that we've been doing a live show.
What are we calling the ferret?
Senor Burrito.
Why Senor Burrito?
Because.
Is that a chatroom influence thing?
No, his name is Senor Burrito.
Okay.
Don't mean to step on Senor Burrito over there.
Say hello to Senor Taco over there in the corner.
Loki!
I'm not Senor Taco.
I do not like tacos.
How are you?
Sorry, Senor McDonald's.
I don't know what this is.
It's not food, that's for sure.
That's why I don't feel bad eating it.
See, I can't get fat off of it because it's not actually food.
It's like toxic waste in buns.
Oh yeah, that will make your ass big.
That's for sure.
Don't you have a wedding to prepare for?
I am.
Game Over.
We're here taping live on this Sunday evening.
Of course, if you've been living in a cave and you missed last week's show, we do now tape our podcast live on Sunday nights to allow our listeners to interact with us.
And you can interact with us by heading on over to our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com.
Click on chat.
Or if you're listening taped on the podcast, you can always send us an email.
Our mailbag is mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
It's great.
Send us an email.
We'll get to the mailbag a little later.
But first, let's get to the games.
And talk about how our gaming weeks were.
Because that's how we start things off here.
DarkSakura.
Mine was special.
As in not very.
I actually went, made it to school this week.
Because I actually sort of started school.
And someone was in there playing puppies.
Playing...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Whatever happened to your friend that was like hardcore in Nintendogs that I met at your bachelorette party and she had like the Dalmatian and everything.
Oh, Melchon.
Yes.
I think she's still playing with her puppies, but she's Dan's assistant manager.
That game just got old, I'm sorry to say.
She's playing with the villagers too, with her village people.
Are they all doing the YMCA?
No, mine are doing the migrate out of DarkSakura's town right now.
Mine are doing the let's go pick weeds.
I'm actually harassing Limburg right now for all of his Japanese stuff in his house because I'm remaking the Shrine to Fire.
You know the best way to get people to move out of your town on Animal Crossing?
Leave a lot?
Don't talk to them.
Ever.
And then they leave because they feel ignored.
Good.
Isn't it sad that we're talking about a fake town on a fake video game?
No.
And yet, people have these real social interactions.
Okay, forget it.
Anything else to share?
No.
Loki.
Yes?
Your gaming week, you played anything?
Yes, I did play.
I actually got to play a little bit more of my 360.
I was playing Ridge Racer this morning, and I love that game.
It plays exactly like every other Ridge Racer game.
Probably because they haven't really changed much in it.
But it looks good, and I got through quite a bit.
I had to find the right car, you know, because each car kind of handles a little bit differently.
Then I finally found my right car for it, and now I'm kicking ass.
And I do like the fact they've had actually more downloads for it now, so there's more cars.
And I purchased some of the music that I liked from the other games, because you can download that as well, because it costs money.
Boo.
But
I did that anyways.
And I also played a little bit of Final Fantasy XI for the 360 because they have the beta now that you can get with
I was listening to other podcasts where folks were getting the Final Fantasy XI.
It was taking them like three hours to install it.
I had memories of the PC version.
Hey, guess what, guys?
Here's something you may not know for those of you that are getting on the 360 for the first time that weren't doing the PC.
Expect those three-hour patches like once every two months because they'll change something big in the game and then everybody tries to patch at the same time.
I have to say, I don't want to start a whole MMO debate, but World of Warcraft has their patching down.
The way they do it, because they use peer-to-peer to do it, it's smooth.
I've never had a patching problem on World of Warcraft, but Final Fantasy XI?
Nightmares.
The only thing that I would say that's pretty good about this is that the actual screens and the play-on-line stuff is really quick.
That's really quick.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Oh my gosh, they're going to letterbox it for regular TVs?
Yes, it's going to be letterboxed.
That chat dialogue is going to be horrible trying to read that stuff on a regular TV.
And you have to have to buy a USB keyboard in order to play this thing.
It's near impossible to play it without it.
But that's the same story with the PlayStation 2.
Does any old USB keyboard work?
Yeah, pretty much.
That's not going to be a problem for most people.
That's not a big problem, but...
The only thing, I tried playing it a little bit this morning.
I can't really level up at all because there's a ton of new people starting.
Remember, this is like an entirely brand new server that they're testing it on right now, so everybody's like level one.
It's like, imagine all the rabbits in the very beginning of the game.
Camp the hell.
I mean, there's like no way to get anything.
It kind of sucks.
So it's a brand new game for every region, right?
Because when Final Fantasy XI launched in the US, we were hooked up automatically with the Japanese servers.
Well, this is just a beta test server right now.
You know, and I...
When I first played Final Fantasy XI, I bought Final Fantasy XI on launch day for the PC when it first came out years ago.
And I don't remember that being a problem.
Of course, at the same time, I didn't know what the hell I was doing in that game because that game just kind of throws you into it.
It doesn't have a very excellent tutorial with it, so you just kind of have to jump in and get going.
And so I didn't even know to kill rabbits for a couple days.
Do you remember how long I was going through WTF mode in that game?
Oh, yeah.
I was like, I miss...
I miss Ragnarok already.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
and DarkSakura.com.
And you're going to have to have Xbox Live and play online to play it.
So you're going to be paying two fees.
Not necessarily.
You only need silver to play this.
So you only have to really pay one fee.
But I'm already paying for Xbox Live Gold.
What the hell do I need to be paying another fee for?
Honestly, I'm not picking this up when this comes out.
I really don't care.
In the expansion, it's not going to be a big deal.
And what they've done with it so far, I thought this was supposed to be the...
Big huge thing.
Ooh, look, it's an MMO coming to the Xbox.
Ooh, it's going to be amazing.
I'm not amazed at all.
I'm not even impressed a little bit.
It looks just like a PC game, I mean the PC version, and it has not improved in any way whatsoever.
Now, do you think someone like me or someone like Jamie who has a widescreen HDTV of a larger size than any computer monitor sitting in their living room, do you think we might benefit from it a little more because we'll have a better...
Better visual to handle it.
I don't think so.
The textures, like I said, aren't improved.
If anything, it's going to be a little bit blurrier for you guys, but that's about it.
Remember what I say, though.
What's that?
It's all about the gameplay.
It's still Final Fantasy XI, and it still has crap for gameplay.
I don't want to sit here and bash XI totally, unlike Jamie, because it was a lot.
I played Final Fantasy XI for like two years, okay?
There's a lot to really like about the game, and I suppose that I can at least applaud...
I'd rather see, and as much as I really hate Phantasy Star Online, I'd rather see that on this.
I haven't even gotten far enough yet to see if there's any lag anywhere, but I'm not impressed and I'm not going to be picking it up when it comes out.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
You can dream.
By the way, assuming all goes well, I should actually have my Kingdom Hearts very, very soon.
Are you importing the one from Japan?
Yes.
Sweet.
All right.
But I've also got my US one on pre-order.
Cool.
Anything else that you're playing this week, Loki?
Grand Theft Auto.
Lots of Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories because...
I just can't get enough of that game.
We've been playing all the deathmatches again.
We're actually kind of playing now with the cheat device a little bit because one of the things you can do with the cheat device is manipulate the gravity in the game and it'll actually, you can unload the cheat device and launch a multiplayer game with the gravity in place.
So I, for instance, could have like .1 gravity and other people could be, you know, having just normal gravity and I'll jump way the fuck over them.
So it's kind of fun.
Um...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Mega Man X4 was kind of cool.
Wait, no, I'm sorry.
5 and 6.
X4.
What was the last one?
X4 had the sucker in it.
Okay, I take it back.
X5 and X6 kind of sucked.
But then I'm like, well, X1 was kind of cool.
Do I really want to pay all this again just to play, you know, X1?
I don't know.
If you want to get Mega Man X1, get Mega Man Powered Up or Maverick Hunter X, the remake for the PSP.
That's like 20 bucks.
Is that out now?
I don't know.
I think it's coming out the first week in February
Battle and Chase
Maybe somebody in chat knows.
Speaking of chat, chat has some feedback to what we've been talking about so far.
For instance, Jaded2006 had a comment on Nintendogs.
Nintendogs died because nobody wanted another Pet Rock.
Kind of true there.
Another point here.
Somebody made a point on Phantasy Star Online.
I think it was Rini.
Rini said, Loki, don't forget, even Phantasy Star Online charges you per month as well on top of the Xbox Live fees.
At least the regular Xbox version does.
But that's the one good thing about this whole silver and gold thing that I see is that now we won't have that anymore.
Because that was my complaint about PSO on the Xbox too.
Which is too bad because PSO on the Xbox is my favorite version.
I did like the one on PC a whole lot, but Xbox had voice chat.
Come on.
I guess you could use team speak and stuff with a PC, but I don't know.
There's something about having it all streamlined.
I'm hoping that there's going to be an MMO coming out that's actually...
You know, when you pay for gold, it's basically the same fee.
It's applied to it.
So I don't have to pay these extra fees.
Alright, anyway, if you want to join our chatroom, moronsontrader.com, click on chat.
Speaking of MMOs, one other game I've been playing this week, a lot more World of Warcraft, because Miklatov, who was here on the show last week, convinced me to come back after my little hiatus, so I've been playing on his server, and I did our first instance.
Well, I think that's what you call it when you do the dungeon with party, but it's not high level.
We're only like level...
I think about 16, 17 and we're doing like a low level dungeon.
I think they call it an instance still.
Yeah.
Because it's like a harder quest.
It was actually a lot of fun.
Well, the reason they're called instances is because each dungeon is loaded up for just your party.
I thought so.
See, somebody was trying to tell me that was only in Guild Wars that that happened and that's true.
Guild Wars does that too but yeah, I realized that because none of the creatures were respawning when we were going through the dungeon and I was like maybe this is like just for us when we go through in that
I don't want to talk to those people
My roommate showed me how to block out the general chat.
GH, please.
No, in this one, they're all shouting for instances.
WC party, need healer.
RFC party, need healer.
So now everybody knows I'm horde on some server because those are horde quests.
Anyway, let's get into tonight's news, shall we?
Gizmondo
Well, it looks like Tiger Telematics, which is the parent company handling Gizmondo, stated that they've offered the stock IP and patents of SmartAds subsidiary as an equity on a $21.2 million loan from their shareholders.
Oopsie!
Uh-oh.
You mean the ad service wasn't a hit?
Okay, basically the terms of the deal, the loan that was overdue to be repaid, and also just for our UK listeners, that's 12.68 million pounds.
You know what this is like?
This is like friends of mine who have been in very bad financial situations that have to sell their car to pay the rent.
That's kind of what this sounds like to me.
The catch on this one is that the loan has to be repaid by March 30th unless Tiger can raise $75 million in new equity or debt by that date.
Then the company says it's working on securing that.
If it can get the $75 million, then $1.68 million of the loan must be repaid immediately and the remainder to come before June 30th.
and if the company doesn't get it or can't repaid it, the two shareholders will be taking over the smart ad system.
You know what could save this company?
What?
It's the same thing that saved other companies.
Side talking.
Did you have something additional in this?
No, I don't.
Nothing additional other than I'm not surprised.
They tried.
They really tried.
Why did the Gizmondo fail?
Why did the Betamax fail?
I think the Gizmondo failed because they didn't really have any big name games to kind of draw us to the system.
You know, the system's only as good as the games that are on it, right?
And we saw this one game, Johnny, whatever, that looked, you know, whatever.
It looked okay.
But there was no big draw.
But it wasn't a big draw, you know what I mean?
and I never once, walking into a large store like Best Buy, Fry's, never once have I seen a setup for Gizmondo.
Well, Gizmondo, the problem with it also was the games that were launching on it were last generation games.
Also, they had this wonderful ad service in there where you have to watch ads in order to shut your system off.
Oh, I remember that.
Oh, that's fun.
And also possibly talking about a redesign of the system before the system launches.
Well, that's a great idea.
That'll get people to buy your system.
Yeah.
All right.
Well, I guess... At least their system came out.
That's more than we could say about the... About the Phantom?
Exactly.
Well, it's not over till it's over, but, you know, it's over.
Moving on, other stories.
I have a story here about the 9th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, because, you know, it's awards season, and there's, you know, this group, the Interactive Achievement Awards, they're handing out awards, and...
Here's what's nominated for Game of the Year.
God of War, Guitar Hero, Shadow of the Colossus, Call of Duty 2, and Nintendogs.
You know what else is missing from this list?
Resident Evil 4, which is getting a lot of awards.
So it's kind of interesting.
And I don't know, maybe it missed the eligibility point or something because Resident Evil 4 came out really, really early in 2005.
So maybe it just narrowly missed some type of eligibility window.
I don't know.
Computer Games nominated, Fear, Civilization 4, Battlefield 2, Age of Empires 3, and the movies.
Just a whole, whole lot of categories here.
I'm obviously not going to sit here and read them all.
But I thought it was interesting because they have a cellular game of the year.
And nobody really ever talks about cell phone games because most of them suck.
But if you want to, you know, this might clue you into what a couple of the good ones are.
Mile High Pinball, Skipping Stone, 1, Ancient Empires 2, and High Seas.
None of which I've ever heard of on my cell phone.
But I have Sprint, and they have, like, different games than the other people, I think.
I always delete them.
I, like, have Bejeweled on my phone or something.
I had Bejeweled multiplayer for a little while, and it was all right.
I had Castlevania on the cell phone, which was cool for, like, five minutes, because it was like, dude, it's just like Castlevania 1, but then you realize I'm trying to play a game on my cell phone, and the action is, like, so choppy.
It's pretty bad.
It's one of those things, like, I got this to listen to the theme music once in a while.
I don't know.
I don't know what else
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Probably making sure they have enough units out there and maybe launching on time for everyone.
You know what's interesting is that I seem to remember that was a big part of their talk behind that controller.
When they first showed the pictures of the Revolution controller, they were like, hey, everybody's used a TV remote, so this makes it kind of accessible to everybody.
Exactly.
Interesting argument.
Yeah, that way it's so anybody, you know, your grandma can go pick up this game and figure out how to do this, okay?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
And that's how they think they're going to win the next-gen... Did he say anything about actually putting out Twilight Princess this year?
That should be one of their goals, I think.
Have you noticed all has been kind of quiet on the Twilight Princess front?
I don't know if that's just... It's still coming out.
We're still kind of... Because we're in a quiet period right now.
It's kind of a slow news period right now.
But I don't know.
It's just... What?
Well, you're laughing over there.
I'm laughing at the book reference.
Oh.
I had to read that.
Anyway, but no, I think that at the point that they start being very quiet about something that either means one of two things, something is going very well or something is going horrendously wrong.
What do you think is the case in the PlayStation 3, which has also been very, very quiet lately?
Horribly wrong.
I've got theories on this one, but my comments on that are coming up on later issues.
All right, fine.
My thing is I think they're starting to get towards the end here.
they're starting to get towards their dates that they said that they were going to hit and they're nowhere near hitting those dates and I think that it's a bad sign right now seeing as that none of the actual alpha kits have gone out for the PS3 and so far we haven't yet to see an actual playable demo or anything that's actually running well we've seen some demos running on the hardware but nothing playable and the fact that
The beta kits aren't even out.
This thing's nowhere near production.
No one knows what the cost is.
No one knows when it's coming out.
I'm not even sure it's coming out this year.
Interesting feedback here from SSJ100 Matt.
Nintendo's stocks are up 6%.
And I do remember reading an article on this is that after there was that big spiel about Nintendo, the revolution will not be above this price, the stocks went up.
I remember reading somewhere on the internet.
I don't think the story made the cut for tonight, but I remember seeing that somewhere on the internet.
I thought that was kind of neat.
I'm not sure if they're going to be able to do under $299, but let's just say they do $199, that thing's going to fly off shelves.
It's going to be...
Thanks for watching!
Speculation
and so on.
A Nintendo DS game is usually about $35.
I'd say about $35 is as high as I've seen it, too.
I think that's what I paid for... Oh, hell.
Kirby!
Oh, not Kirby, because that was a present.
I know there's something I bought that was $35.
I'd probably touch and go when I first bought it.
That's why I got it confused.
It's the same game.
It's just Kirby's a lot better.
Yeah.
Anyway.
Moving on.
Now, a follow-up to something we talked about last week.
We talked about this Nintendo DS redesign was on the way, and there's going to be this whole great announcement on Monday.
And then what happened, Loki?
What happened on Monday?
The only announcement was that there's not a redesign.
Of course, they didn't say there wasn't going to be a redesign, so... Ever.
They didn't say there wasn't going to be a redesign, ever.
They basically said, we have no news to... Basically, our system is awesome.
We have no news regarding redesigns.
It says, but we have nothing to announce at this time.
Nothing to announce at this time.
That's the key word, meaning that there is going to be a redesign, just not right now.
Probably something that they'll save for E3 or...
There is going to be a redesign.
Nintendo cannot stand to leave something alone.
There's always going to be a redesign.
You know what?
I've seen great, great arguments out there on the internet, though, when people were debunking this.
It's like, you know, if it's not broke, why fix it?
DSs are still selling like hell.
And somebody else sent me an article that also didn't make the cut for tonight, but talking about how the Japanese are really, really pushing to get DSs back on shelves.
They're even importing them back in the country and just crazy stuff, you know.
So if it's not broke, why fix it?
They won't need to put out a new DS until DS sales slow down.
Which, as long as they keep putting out really solid games for it, probably isn't going to happen anytime soon.
With Tetris DS right around the corner, I think that's going to be a big motivator for more systems.
All they would have to do to make more of those systems fly off the shelves, shoot, do another $20 price cut.
Tetris DS and you also have the same month is going to be Metroid Prime Hunters.
It's going to be a huge month for DS.
And what's PSP got on the horizon?
What's PSP have?
They have the new Splinter Cell Essentials.
Katamari Damacy, I suppose.
Katamari's coming out in March.
They've got a new... I'm trying to think if there's anything else that was really... They have a lot of... There's 29 games for the PSP coming out in March.
So, I mean, that's a lot of stuff.
But... You know, speaking of DS, it's not on the outline for tonight's show, but you had something about Phoenix Wright.
Yeah.
The DS game.
What happened with this?
Another...
Too popular for its own good?
It is too popular for its own good.
And unfortunately, if you don't have one right now and there are none in your local store, you're not going to be seeing it until March.
Because, like most Japanese games, they get produced in Japan.
It's going to be a six-week turnaround time because Capcom is sold out of them right now.
And no way you can get one until March.
Wow.
Yeah, February, March-ish.
Wow, wow, wow.
Crazy.
Crazy.
All right.
Well, enough about what's going on in Japan and over here in the U.S.
How about our buddies over in the U.K.?
DarkSakura likes to keep tabs on what's going on overseas the other way and fills us in with the U.K.
report.
Well, we actually have an update that the U.K.
DS sales reached $1 million.
They have surpassed that 1 million unit sale, which is pretty big since it's been out less than a year over there.
They said that several of the major retailers in the UK were completely sold out of the systems too, and so people have to wait for quite a while.
Worldwide sales are a good bit higher than 13 million now.
Wow, Nintendo just knows how to do their handhelds.
What can you say?
They are the pros.
Also, Dead or Alive 4 has a UK release date.
They said it will ship on January 27th.
For those of you guys that need your boobie fix, it's on its way.
I warn you, the whole reaction system in that, that game's a pain in the ass.
Really?
The last boss is the biggest cheese ball in the universe.
I'd like to mention something real quick about DOA 4 that makes no sense to me.
I was playing that game, and there was one cutscene that they have where one of the female characters is trying to buy a head of lettuce, and this other female character
Who seemed to be of royalty or something, took the lettuce away from her, and then they fought.
What the hell is that for a story?
They're fighting over a goddamn head of lettuce.
That was so retarded.
And by the way, their boobs pout way too much in this game still.
On the next Jerry Springer.
No, you have to set the age.
We've got the age set to 30, I think.
Because of Dan.
Bouncy Boobies
So your age determines the bounce.
That's weird.
Anything else in the U.K.?
Yes, actually, a game I'm actually pretty excited about.
In fact, I might be doing something regarding a translation of this game for the U.S., but that's another story.
Tales of Phantasia, a Japanese RPG, is going to be out on the Game Boy in March in the U.K.,
And I'm actually pretty excited about that game because Tales of Phantasia has a pretty unique battle system.
I've seen a bit of it in action, the Japanese version.
Pretty cool intro, too.
But...
It was out on the Super Famicom back in the day.
And of course, was it Tales of Symphonia?
And another game, one on PlayStation 2 and the other on GameCube, came out in the United States, but we never did see Tales of Fantasia.
So I think it's pretty exciting that there's going to be a release for that on the Game Boy Advance.
And of course, it's going to be out in Europe at the end of March.
Very cool.
And in the United States sometime beginning of March.
Very cool.
All right, thank you for that, DarkSakura.
You're quite welcome.
Our folks overseas appreciate you.
They better.
They better appreciate you, too.
I mean, I love you guys.
All right.
You know, interesting comment here in the chat room, summing up the Dead or Alive 4 story that Loki was telling us about.
DarkTetsuya says, DOA 4 has a story?
Which I think perfectly sums it up right there.
It's all about John Lee's ending, which is hilarious.
Blink, Blink, Blink
Dr. Sudoku 3x3 Box
It's this huge puzzle craze.
So, of course, they think, hmm, puzzle, Game Boy Advance, Tetris, best-selling game.
Well, shit, we need to put Sudoku out there.
So, Dr. Sudoku is coming out in February.
It's got more than 1,000 puzzles.
And, of course, will be the first of many, many Sudoku games to hit various game systems, just like Tetris, just like World Championship poker games and all that stuff.
What do you think?
Next big thing, or...
Just whatever.
Maybe if I ignore it, it'll go away.
You know what's interesting?
I don't understand the sudden interest in Sudoku because these puzzle books that they've sold in stores... I remember these from when I was younger.
I was such a nerd that my parents could buy me one of these books and we would go on a road trip and I'd shut up for a long time.
And...
These Sudoku puzzles appeared in the books.
I want to say it's like Penny Press or somebody puts out these books.
You can get them in supermarkets.
These Sudoku puzzles appeared in these books a long time ago except they were called something else.
That's something with a more English title.
It was like crypto numbers or something was like the name of the puzzles.
And why now is this stuff all the rage?
That's what I'm not getting.
People are trend whores.
I guess, but it's just really weird.
And I'll admit, I've done a couple Sudoku puzzles.
Recently I was in a waiting room for a long time and I was like, there's the New York Times, and I was like, oh, Sudoku.
I'll do the puzzle there.
But I don't know.
I can't see myself spending money to buy this on Game Boy Advance.
I do think its popularity is a good thing because it's something that encourages people to actually use their brains.
True, true.
But, you know, I don't know.
Also, to me...
Game Boy Advance wouldn't match for me just the pen and paper version of doing it, you know?
Imagine that, having fun with pen and paper.
I know it's a strange concept for some gamer folks, but, you know, go figure.
Well, you know, there are people who have actually forgotten how to write from typing so much.
Hmm.
It actually is a sort of epidemic thing in Japan where people have forgotten how to write certain kanji because when you type, you can select it from a list.
Hmm.
Interesting comment.
I'm reading chat room for some comments on Sudoku.
Rini says that Dr. Sudoku will be a battery drainer.
Let's see.
Ninst says it's the rage now because someone slapped a foreign word on it.
So yes, whores.
And Xander C has the same thing.
It's popular now because it has the Japanese name now.
And then, of course, WonderDogHerald says they should have a Pokemon Sudoku game.
That's how they sold Tetris Attack.
Nobody bought Tetris Attack when it was, well, a couple of people did, but not a lot of people bought Tetris Attack when it was first out and had Yoshi and stuff.
Slap some Pokemon characters on it, put it on the N64, Pokemon Puzzle League.
Is that why Tetris DS has the Retro Mario and Zelda characters in it?
Probably.
Probably.
And then, of course, we have VXJasonXV, our lovely webmaster.
We love him.
And chat says, you can't erase paper.
Get an eraser mate.
Get one of those eraser mate pens.
You can't erase paper.
Loki, what's going on in the movie world?
We have, uh...
Oh my god, House of the Dead 2?
Yes.
They're making a House of the Dead 2?
That was exactly my reaction.
Dear God, why?
When I saw it on our list of movies, you know, upcoming movies, I was like, why the hell would they make a sequel to that?
Didn't they lose enough money on the first one?
And it's not Yui Bol this time.
It's not Yui Bol.
So it might be good.
I know.
It might be that rare sequel that's better than the original.
You have to remember, it's not just the director that ruins a movie, okay?
You have the same writers as the...
All in the Dark, and House of the Dead in this one.
What's also scary is these same writers are doing a Dead or Alive movie, as if you couldn't tell that one was going to suck.
Now, what's great, though, is this movie, it says it picks up where the last film left off, where the government operatives investigate the island and the mysterious house.
So, in other words, the first game, because the last one was a prequel to
Everything.
So is that like Jurassic Park 2 when they went back to the island to research the dinosaurs?
I don't know.
Are they going to whip out keyboards and have letters pop up in front of the zombies?
Is Julianne Moore going to be in it?
No, not Julianne Moore, but you have Sticky Fingers is going to be in it.
Oh, God.
I just hope it has some of the cheeseball dialogue that was in the game.
There was nothing we could do.
Let me put it this way, folks.
Do not buy this when it comes out on DVD.
Instead, you can watch it for free when it premieres on SyFy on February 11th.
Yeah, but it won't have titty on SyFy.
Oh, it's not going to have titty anyways, probably.
Oh, actually, no.
Nudity and brief sexuality.
No nudity in the SyFy version, but really, are you missing anything?
No, you're not.
But it might be one of those movies that's so bad it's good.
Like Blood Rain?
Like Showgirls, one of my favorite movies of all time.
So bad, it's good.
And if you watch it on VH1, it's even worse because they draw the bras on and everything.
I love Showgirls because it's so, so bad.
Anyways, you don't know shit.
If you are masochist when it comes to actually...
You're watching these movies.
The DVD will be released in the United States on March 21st, as well as also debuting on Sci-Fi Channel on February 11th.
So, check it out.
Well, let me set my TiVo now.
Let's talk about a more promising movie, shall we?
Let's talk about Silent Hill.
The trailer hit the internet this week and it's getting really good reaction.
I've already made two icons from it.
Have you seen the Silent Hill website now is updated and changed?
It looks awesome.
They did this whole flash thing with it where it looks all nice at first and it goes creepy on you all of a sudden and they got cool backdrops and stuff.
It's welcome to SilentHill.com.
Did you guys all watch the trailer?
Yes.
What did you think?
Yes, I did as I made two icons out of it.
I had to ask.
Pyramid Head
It's great because it seems like it really is going to be a great video game adaptation.
These guys paid attention to the games.
And granted, the story's a lot different, but we kind of have the characters from Silent Hill 1 in a way, some of that, or the ambience of Silent Hill 1 and the music.
We have a lot of the characters from Silent Hill 2, and then kind of the look of Silent Hill 3.
Towards the end of the trailer, it looks a lot like Silent Hill 3, so it's kind of got all of that.
no signs of Silent Hill 4 but I suppose they want to leave room for a sequel or something who knows but the cool thing I thought about the trailer was that they used music from the games in the trailer and we heard that you know Akira was going to do Akira Yamaoka was going to do the soundtrack then he wasn't then some other guy was going to do it and it was going to be inspired by Akira Yamaoka's original score so I don't know if this is some of the score that's actually going to be in the movie but this is it this is great because somebody just basically re-recorded what Akira Yamaoka did it's awesome it fits the trailer very well
He said he was going to be using elements from the original, so I think that's more where we got a lot of that from.
Well, usually I don't run out to go see these movies, but this one's actually one I'm looking forward to.
The trailer's a little eh.
But, you know, as far as the way they did it, it makes it a little cheesy.
But it looks good.
And especially if you watch the teaser, you know, the way they did the teaser trailer, it's really, you know... The teaser was awesome.
That was awesome.
That had, like, the total style of Silent Hill and everything.
And especially towards the end of the trailer when they show Pyramid Head again, you know, it's going to be just awesome.
I'm scared I'm going to be really let down because my expectations now are so, so, so high for this movie.
I'm really scared I'm going to get let down by it.
I think...
It's one of those films, at some point they're going to have to be good.
They're going to have to start being good.
And I think what people need is a movie to set the bar so that people will stop going to see these piece of crap movies that Webull puts out.
Because they're really bad and they need to have some people out there go, you know what, this is what a video game movie should look like.
I'm not paying to see this crap.
Stop putting this crap out.
Talk to these studios.
That's what they need to be doing.
I honestly, I would have to say, because they would have to, to get that degree of accuracy and to keep the story that far in line, they'd have to be working fairly close with the creating team out of Konami.
Well, you know the Konami logo shows up at the end of the trailer, so that was kind of cool.
I mean, I suppose that's a property rights thing anyway, but, you know, still promising.
That also offers hope, though, that if Konami is getting in on that and making it so good, you know?
That they won't fuck up Metal Gear?
I want so bad for a Metal Gear movie.
I think that in this case I really pray that his reputation is heated.
We'll see.
Alright, moving on.
Now, you know, there's lots of things that lazy people do, and one of them is watching a lot of movies.
One of them could be playing a lot of games.
In fact, one of these folks who lost a lot of weight recently has been in the media, says that games made him fat.
Right, Loki?
What's going on with this?
Well, Jared, he was apparently a big Nintendo fan.
Wait, Jared, like the Subway guy?
Yeah.
Oh, okay, that guy.
Yeah, he...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I don't think Nintendo is the sole thing to blame here, obviously.
He needs to be blaming himself for not getting his ass up off the couch and going outside and exercising.
He has himself to blame.
And trust me, I've lost 80 pounds.
I know that what it took for me was getting my ass up off from in front of the TV and going and working out and eating right.
He had to have done the same thing, right?
He says he had, you know,
One hand on the controller, one hand in a bag of chips.
So we know who we need to be coming after.
Potato chips!
They're the root of all evil.
He needs to take responsibility for himself and blame it on his own personal weakness.
People themselves are responsible for their own health.
Okay, here, devil's advocate for a minute.
Is Nintendo an enabler?
Or video games in general?
It was still his choice.
It was just there.
It's the same thing as sitting and watching pay-per-view all day.
Video games in that regard are no different from sitting on the couch watching pay-per-view, wrestling, porn, internet, chat rooms.
It's all the same.
It was his choice to sit and play the game, and it was his choice to eat potato chips, and then, to his credit, he made the decision to do something different.
He decided one day to get up and eat something better, even if it was Subway.
God, Togo's is so much better.
I'm a Quiznos fan, but anyway.
But he made the decision to put some effort and take responsibility for himself.
To him, go back and blame Nintendo for his obesity?
Just completely...
Cast a big shadow over all of what he's done.
At the same time though, is the gamer community taking this one little quote and blowing it completely out of context?
I think it is.
I think it's just a spin on the story.
I'm sure it's probably something like, you know, I used to sit around playing my Nintendo.
I think he was just probably trying to point out that he was lazy and eating, you know, he wasn't eating right.
and someone's like, oh, he said Nintendo, oh, it's all their fault.
I'm kind of seeing it a little bit like that, too.
I mean, we can kind of poke fun, but in a realistic way is that, you know what, use Jared as an example that, you know, if you are feeling fat, you should put down the controller and go walk.
Because he said, he says that it's not just Subway that made him thinner, it was getting up and walking, going on walks.
I need to actually quote Legend of Zaku here because I fully believe this.
Big happy quote for me.
America, the land that personal responsibility forgot.
You know, it says though, since he was almost 425 pounds, he would have been about 600 pounds though if he were playing World of Warcraft instead of Nintendo.
I know, just think about if they had World of Warcraft back then.
Alright, moving on.
He'd be dead.
Real quick, how much gaming is too much and how can you prevent yourself from being 400 pounds overweight like Jared?
Or whatever he was, I'm sorry, I'm probably grossly over-exaggerating.
But how can you prevent yourself from being that overweight?
Well, you know I was on my way there, unfortunately.
I moved out here from Alabama and put on something like...
Well, actually, I'm now under what I weighed when I moved out here, but I did put on something like 70 pounds.
Because Dan and I are both gamers.
We sat around playing Street Fighter all day.
Seriously.
I mean, I'm not joking.
It was that or Castlevania, Symphony of the Night.
And I finally hit my saturation point in 2003 and said, you know, I can't go on this way anymore.
I...
Right then and there, I didn't consider it a diet.
I made a lifestyle change.
You have to incorporate little changes into your life and make them habit.
Go outside the game.
Exactly.
What you do... I played DDR for a while.
DDR was helpful.
It was exercise.
It was fun and exercise.
But I learned to like going to the gym.
I got involved in classes.
I worked out with my friends who were also... It's good to have a friend who has the same goals as you.
But...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
It was quite interesting.
Before, I used to play Final Fantasy 3 and stuff, really long RPGs, and I wouldn't really get out and do anything.
Then I went and played actual QZAR, and that was a lot of exercise and stuff.
Then I stopped playing QZAR to play Final Fantasy 7 and 10 and stuff, and I got really lazy again.
Then DDR came out, and I started playing a lot of DDR, and that got me back to exercising.
Then Final Fantasy 11 came around, and I stopped.
DDR is a great revolution in games, but at the same time it's not the magic weight loss program.
You can't just play DDR and expect to drop 50 pounds.
I think, kind of like Jamie said, it's got to be a bit of a lifestyle change, too.
You can't just play DDR for 15 minutes a day.
It'll help, and you'll get some exercise, but you're not going to really, it's not going to be like this magic, just watch the fat fly, you know, it's different.
Now, if you're doing what I was doing and playing DDR for an hour and a half every day...
You remember when I got mine on Dreamcast back when?
I was playing DDR daily for an hour trying to beat the harder stuff.
And it was that challenging myself is what kept me going.
Finding personal satisfaction in the competitive side of it.
Let me use a real life scenario to kind of illustrate what I'm saying here.
Sometimes me in a group and sometimes you guys would go and what have you.
It just depends.
We used to go out every Wednesday and we'd meet up at the arcade for DDR and whatever else.
and then after we were done, we would go to Brookfields and dine on cheese sticks and soda and soup that's really high in fat and stuff.
See, that's what I'm saying is that there was no change there because you go play DDR and it's like, damn, that game made me hungry.
I'm going to eat a whole basket of cheese sticks by myself.
I actually did lose weight when we were doing that regularly.
Really?
But you weren't ordering the same stuff, were you?
Well, no, but then again, that was when I was also doing my I think I'm going to be a vegetarian now shtick, and then I went back to eating meat in 2003.
Yeah, I did the vegetarian thing for two weeks, too.
And now my body's forcing me into being a vegetarian, but that's just because of my antibiotics.
All right, new subject, new subject.
We've got to keep it moving here.
We still have a lot we want to cover here before we get a break.
Starting with...
Kojima.
You know Kojima.
He's the guy that does Metal Gear.
Hide-chan.
That's right.
He has...
This kind of podcast thing going on.
Those of you guys that are into the podcasting thing might get a kick out of this, is that there's actually a podcast show that he's doing, and he even incorporates Solid Snake into it, which is kind of silly, but whatever.
It's over on Hideo Kojima's blog, which is www.blog.konami.jp.
I'm sorry, slash GS slash Hideo blog.
You know what?
Just go to blog.konami.jp.
You'll find it.
and it's also now in English as well.
You can find his own podcast show and it's called Hidechan Radio.
But it's not in English.
So you have to kind of understand at least a little bit of Japanese unless you just want to listen to Japanese talk.
Like if you're into anime and you're just listening to sexy Japanese talking or whatever, you might get a kick out of this.
It's a good educational tool.
That's true.
Lucha Libre, Telemundo
Video Games Live, concert featuring performances of music from various classic game titles.
It's going to be on Friday, March 24th and performed by the Symphony Silicon Valley Orchestra and its full chorus.
Are we going to have the Pong music again?
Among the games to be highlighted, we have Mario, Zelda, Halo, Metal Gear Solid, Warcraft, Myst, Castlevania, Medal of Honor, Sonic, Kingdom Hearts, and Final Fantasy, along with a retro classic arcade medley featuring over 20 games.
Alright, sounds good.
Get your tickets soon.
It's going to sell out.
Alright, now we're going to move on to another topic.
This one's kind of a long topic.
And the chat room's actually been asking about this all night long when we're going to get to this, so here we go.
You guys probably heard earlier this week there was a gamer out there who took his own life and he was a member of this forum.
Which was what?
A Metal Gear Solid forum, if I remember right.
Unfortunately, here's the thing.
The media kind of tied a knot of this story and I'm even looking at this article that Kotaku ran on it that really was trying to sort things out about what the media misreported.
I think the media said it was a Bulgarian website at some point or something.
It was crazy.
Yeah.
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
Tim Rogers misrepresentation of the AFP story
I'm going to read little blips of this here.
I'm going to get political with you for a moment.
Apparently it was big news for a few moments over in America.
Well, the worst thing is it's not true.
For one thing, the forum member who did in fact commit suicide did not broadcast his death.
Moreover, the forum members tried with all their might to take him down.
What can you do is contact the AFPY organization, tell them that you think this is horrible, that they should fire the reporter responsible for these bizarrely malicious lies, and then apologize as widely as possible.
If you want to read the whole thing, that was originally published over an insert credit, but it also ran on Kotaku, which is where I first saw it.
Good Activism and Bad Activism
I'm not going to mince my words on this.
I'm going to say exactly how I feel.
And before he decides to come after us and say... These are my opinions of you.
I am exercising my First Amendment right, you asshole!
Jack Thompson is a leech.
He is nothing but a parasite.
He cares nothing about the person that committed suicide.
He cares nothing about the family.
He cares nothing about the families of the people involved in those cases he's working on.
He is using their pain and suffering to be a leech and use it to further his goal of notoriety and to fill his pocketbook.
That is all he is after.
He cares nothing about those families.
and, of course, is using the gaming community by basically publicly defaming the entire community.
And what did he do to demonstrate this to you this week?
It had to do with basically the letters and posts he was doing regarding the suicide that went on.
Basically, and on top of that, I find this exactly hilarious, he was trying to use the Bible to support, and he's a lawyer?
Yeah.
He should know something like that would not hold up in court.
Excuse me?
No, wait.
Devil's Advocate for just a minute because I'm curious here.
How do we know it's really him?
Because these are being done through anonymous posts on the game's politics website.
Sorry, game politics website, right?
How do we know it's really him?
Could it just be somebody trying to... Trace of IP?
Also, every other thing that I've ever read by him, it very much fits how he writes.
and I've gotten good at that because I've had to hunt down impersonators and things before.
I think they actually posted in there some type of letter that Jack Thompson had tried to send to the folks in Pennsylvania against GamePolitics.com.
I think it's definitive of how gamers can be very intelligent people.
I think this website stands up for that.
And when I see Jack Thompson attacking that, it makes me go, he's threatened by that.
He's threatened by that good, upstanding gamers doing smart, intelligent things.
He called playing video games a masturbatory activity, as in senseless self-stimulation.
You know, maybe if he had some stimulation, he wouldn't be so anal retentive that he spews shit every time he opens his mouth.
Sorry.
I said I wasn't going to mince my words.
That's exactly how I feel.
All right.
Okay.
I'm going to be a good girl now.
We're going to have to explicit tag this show.
That's all right.
Usually that gets more listeners.
Anyway.
Yay, press.
No.
But seriously, I apologize for my... That was very Jack Thompson of you.
Just teasing.
But seriously, though, and this... I get the emails on it.
I hear about it and it's just, I hit my saturation point.
I'm like, okay, someone, he needs to just go away.
And, you know, I'm always one that believes if you ignore the problem, you know, it doesn't necessarily go away.
It might get worse.
You know, things don't change until you make them change, right?
Someone seriously, you know, if he's going to be all up in arms defaming the community, I think the community needs to take some steps to defend itself.
FlowersForJack.com
LiveJournal.com LiveJournal.com LiveJournal.com LiveJournal.com
This only makes us into what he says we are.
We are to the point that he will disregard any correspondence at the very least, threaten it legally at the most.
It's hard to get his attention for real.
I propose we write him a stern, dignified letter free of insults, exaggerations or unfounded complaints and state the most honest and reasonable case we can.
Most importantly, it will be sent with as many bouquets of beautiful pink roses as I can possibly send to his office.
Love it.
Love it.
You should totally do that.
We're going to send $20 on behalf of Orange Lounge Radio.
We are contributing to this.
He's going to call an act of terrorism.
Flowers, an act of terrorism, come on.
Come on.
And for all those people that I'm reading that say, you know, kill him, do that, no.
That's exactly what these guys are saying you should not do.
But my other point to that, to maybe convince people that that's not the best course of action?
Martyr.
Remember what happened to our last major martyr, right?
We now have rampant Christianity everywhere.
Now listen, this is the same guy who considered a donation in his name of $10,000 as a defamation of character.
I mean, it's pretty retarded.
I did also find it funny that one of the things I read, how he's bringing out that had this person known the love of Jesus Christ, they wouldn't have done that.
He was basically shot down by a minister.
by a Protestant pastor.
This kind of brings me to another point.
I get really nervous when we get into the religious talk on this show, and I'm not a very religious person myself, and there are certain types of religious people I have a lot of respect for.
I have a really, really good friend of mine at work who's a deeply religious person, but I value him totally as a friend, and I really respect him and his beliefs and stuff because
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I don't know how much of this I really want to read.
You should just go read it for yourself over on GamePolitics.com.
I am a Christian, non-denominational, yet I am also the first person to admit that enforcing religious opinion as a way of censorship in video games is asinine.
Let's face facts.
Video games are fiction, just like books, movies, and television.
However, it seems as if pundits, lawyers, and media mongers have been using my religion as a meat shield for their ignorant attacks on video games.
Very interesting, and it kind of goes on to these...
GamePolitics.com
That is a good point.
That is a very good point.
And, you know, we do also donate to charity once in a while, too.
We did the big audio Sacramento Independent Audio for Katrina Relief thing a while ago, which was a good success.
And, you know, so we do that stuff, too.
But we, you know, we support causes that we want to back.
And this is definitely one of those causes that we think ought to deserve a little support and a little air time and a little money.
Just a little money.
We're not sending them a lot.
Twenty bucks isn't a lot.
So, anyway.
Whew.
Anything else you want to say on that?
We good?
Loki, you're awfully quiet.
Jack, he had that thing that came out last week about wanting to recall all these games that are coming out in 25 to Life and all these violent murder simulators, as he said.
He's right.
We do have too many murder simulators out there.
That's why we need more sex simulators.
That's what I'm hoping for.
Rockstar, if you're listening, get on it.
Hot coffee the game.
All right.
We got one more segment to do before we go to break here.
And it just seemed like, I don't know why, but it seemed like an inappropriate time to get into this segment.
Maybe it's just me.
But it's time to bring on the anger in the FUs of the week.
DarkSakura, what's ticking you off this week?
Well, I think I actually just ranted myself out on the biggest thing that was pissing me off this week.
So, instead of going off on ye olde butthead again, I'm going to have to say that my biggest FU of the week goes toward waiting to the last minute to get things done.
In this case, I blame myself because I waited to the last minute to check my tires, so now I have a flat.
Oops!
but it's I see so many I have to deal with this so often in my daily work people going oh I didn't do it or oh I forgot or oh this it goes back to this thing called personal responsibility right it's personal responsibility I think people not accounting for it not having it is what is contributing to the downfall of this country you see it in little things every day you see it on a wide scale like with our
Not-so-good-friend Mr. Thompson, who is blaming games instead of individual people for their own actions, right?
We see it ourselves with, oh, well, I can just do this later.
Or with, oh, but I was busy doing this.
If people said, you know, I admit I was wrong.
Let me make amends.
Let me do this.
If people would just stop and admit, hey, you know, you need to do this.
Or, I didn't do it.
Or, here, it's done.
Right on time.
I think that
Would I be better off?
It's a sign of responsibility.
You know, the moment you admit that you broke the glass is the day you're supposed to be an adult, right?
Instead of blaming the dog.
Hmm.
Alright.
Loki?
My F.U.
of the week is going to McDonald's.
Mainly, though, it's not McDonald's fault.
I'm blaming vegetarians and fat people for making McDonald's food taste like crap.
Here's the reason why.
Before the vegetarians attacked McDonald's for adding their meat flavoring to their fries, their fries kicked ass.
Then they came in, fries taste like crap now, and they can't freaking cook them, poor damn.
The other thing is, also, they've tried to make these more healthy choices on their menus.
No!
Need?
The food was good before you had to go and fuck with it.
Listen, if you don't want to eat that crap, don't attack my food.
God damn it, I love super size.
I love the amount of soda that I got there and the amount of fries.
I was happy with that.
But no, you had to come in and put large size on there instead.
Fuck you!
I want my food!
Alright.
My FU of the week goes to Ticket
and things like Ticketmaster and Tickets.com because I still haven't gotten my tickets for a concert that's coming up next week and I hate these exorbitant charges just for printing a freaking ticket it's so crazy I don't like the way tickets are done I never get good seats why is it that I can log on there at like 10.01 and all the good seats are gone oh because all the good seats go to contest winners and industry people and people that don't deserve to be in the front row I deserve to be in the front row
I don't like the way ticketing is done, so F you to that
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Adorable.
But basically the whole premise of this site is people actually just putting things on the cat.
Sending a picture.
Now please don't hurt your cat if you're going to do this, because that's animal cruelty and that's not cool.
Some of these cats just look anywhere from amused to vaguely annoyed.
Some of them are game related though, right?
Oh yeah, well this one has wrestling figures sitting on the cat.
And there was another one, this one has an Xbox 360 laying on a cat.
The cat just looks irritated.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
One of my co-workers and Jamie both pointed this site out to me on the same day.
I thought that was really weird, like how word travels like that.
It was new to me.
I randomly check stuffonmycat.com quite often.
It's cute!
You know, there's one with naked Barbies on it.
Another one just with a giant bag on it.
I think it's adorable.
I love stuffonmycat.com.
No, that's wrong.
I was going to say my favorite is the one where I saw, you know,
Someone's SUV's rear tire on top of a cat, but you know.
Hey!
Alright.
I think, though, that there should be mycatonstuff.com.
I looked for it, but no one did it yet.
I found the picture with the cat covered in Game Boys, so I'm moving that to the chat room.
That's the one my co-workers showed me.
You know what this all is?
This is just the US version of Oolong.
in a way.
You know Oolong's on Wikipedia now.
Yes, I link that to you too.
And so is you being, but Oolong's dead.
And we're on Wikipedia, Orange Lounge Radio.
That's like, that's when some of my friends told me, dude, Rob, you guys really are famous.
You're on Wikipedia.
I'm like, come on.
We do this show out of the spare bedroom in my apartment.
We're not famous yet, but we are on Wikipedia, which is all kinds of cool.
We're internet celebrities, yo.
Take that however you want.
All right, we're going to go to a break.
When we come back from the break, Loki's going to bring us a whole
buttload of Xbox 360 stuff and we're going to do the worst reviewed games of all time and lots of stuff coming up after the break.
