5316	12805	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
13245	15088	And now the conclusion of episode 171 for January 22, 2006.
20069	27531	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 171, the second half here for this January 22nd, 2006.
28951	30651	Pretty lively first half there.
31471	33912	I just made the official donation there during the break.
34032	41494	I went on to the LiveJournal community thing and donated for the Flowers for Jack thing, and I left a little message, $20 from us, so that'll be lovely.
41514	42974	We'll see what happens with that.
43054	46795	I just hope I didn't fund somebody's vacation in Tahiti, so that's why I didn't send more.
46815	47735	No one goes to Tahiti.
47815	48015	I know.
48215	48435	Anyway...
49562	49822	All right.
50282	52023	Anyway, let's get right back into the news.
52063	55705	Yes, we will be opening up the Skype line a little later on for those of you guys in our chat room.
56105	61367	By the way, I think we set a new record in chat tonight for the number of people that we have watching in our chat room tonight.
61407	67109	So thank you guys so much for making this combined show a success and making our live show really take off.
67129	67609	We appreciate it.
68550	70271	And, of course, those of you that listen on the podcast, too.
70291	73132	We know not everybody can watch Sunday night because, you know, some of you guys are watching.
73152	74352	What are the big TV shows on Sunday night?
74372	74792	Family Guy?
74812	77113	Some of you guys are watching Family Guy and the other stuff.
77594	78774	Don't get my ideas, Emily.
79384	80025	I shouldn't give him ideas.
80265	80465	Sorry.
80665	80845	Sorry.
81386	81926	Don't watch Family Guy.
81946	82447	It sucks now.
83287	84568	It's not as good as the first couple seasons.
84809	87931	The TV is as brilliant as me and not watch TV.
90173	92235	You know, this is somewhat gaming related.
92395	94196	I'm going to kind of go off on a random tangent.
94216	94536	I don't care.
95337	95918	I was watching 24.
96058	100681	I only watched the first half because, you know, they did like this four-hour premiere thing last week.
101002	103664	I only watched the first half of it because that's a lot of TV.
103704	104905	I mean, hooray for DVR.
105225	109988	But I was thinking while I was watching it, the show is so suspenseful and very, I don't know, like Metal Gear-esque.
110308	113130	I'm thinking, gosh, this show would make a great video game.
113150	114931	And then I was like, oh yeah, there is a video game.
115231	122656	I remember seeing the trailer at E3, but it's been in development for so long that I believe the story was supposed to be between seasons two and three.
122816	123296	That's correct.
123416	128979	But I don't want to spoil anything, but this show has a tendency to kill off characters that you really get attached to.
129360	134743	So I think it's very interesting that the game is possibly going to have characters that have now been killed off in the storyline.
134763	134843	It's
135043	135544	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
151593	154596	but not as good as games that were out on the Commodore 64.
155217	165347	And I'll tell you what, a lot of people say that they grew up on Atari 2600 or they grew up on Nintendo, ColecoVision, Odyssey, whatever it was, arcades.
165908	167529	I grew up on the Commodore 64.
168571	172835	So, Loki, what did you find out in Commodore 64 news, believe it or not?
172935	173316	C64S.com C64S.com
193092	200397	Ghosts and Goblins, Paperboy, Bruce Lee, Boulder Dash 2, and Blue Max as the top 10 right now.
200477	202218	Oh my gosh, I had Blue Max.
202238	203800	That's crazy.
203920	206381	Boulder Dash, I had that game too, and of course Archon.
206882	207522	Oh my gosh.
207622	208583	What about The Last Ninja?
208663	209584	That game was awesome.
209604	210664	Spy vs. Spy.
210724	212285	I love Spy vs. Spy.
213226	214987	Tons of Boulder Dash stuff on here.
215087	216028	Bomb Jack, Commando 2.
216068	216729	It was a huge title.
218009	227955	Back to the Future, Outrun, Pitfall, you know a lot of games that were on Atari were on Commodore 64 but with better graphics and that's one of them.
228295	230677	And also the one that comes to mind is H.E.R.O.
230697	232758	which is a game I play a hell of a lot of on GameTap.
233138	239462	The graphics on Commodore 64 were way better than the ones on Atari which kind of makes me sad because they don't have the Commodore version on GameTap.
239482	241003	They have about 100 games on there.
241183	241403	Awesome.
241783	243204	Now you know I gotta ask, is this legal?
244085	244385	I don't know.
246789	248590	Check that out, relive your youth
271386	298503	of course I checked out Commodore 64 emulators and they were first the big things in the emulator scene and a lot of them were just really clunky and hard to use so I like this idea of having it much easier and kind of streamlined into the website very nice alright let's move on to a very very new game and a very very popular game in this day and age World of Warcraft I talked about it earlier in the show there's some stuff coming up for what's going on with World of Warcraft Jamie you first
299329	304262	Well, actually, they are going to be celebrating the Lunar New Year.
305174	308216	in World of Warcraft.
308576	314919	There's a celebration, they're saying, as in S-A-L-E.
315359	322523	They'll be getting Sparkly and Azeroth on account of the Lunar New Year, is what it says, between January 27th and February 14th.
322843	324924	There'll be celebrations focusing on Moonglade.
324944	329126	The 29th will also see celebrations in Stormwind, Thunderbluff, and Booty Bay.
329687	330107	Booty Bay.
331067	343774	and while every capital will be decorated on February 13th there will be a firework show at Moonglade paralleling the Chinese Festival of Lanterns so there will be a humongous light show.
344254	358142	Gameplay based events going on based on Azeroth's ancestors quest for holiday items as rewards tokens that can be redeemed for rockets and fireworks and festival dumplings and
359103	361368	different outfits available for the Lunar Holiday.
361388	363152	Does Blizzard know how to throw a party or what?
363573	364055	Seriously?
364496	365278	They do some fun events.
366118	389680	I saw an interesting response to this though on some message board is that they were saying that this was a kind of a way for World of Warcraft to kind of appeal to the Chinese players right now because I guess they did something I haven't really been following a lot of WoW drama but I guess maybe they did something to kind of turn the Chinese players off when they launched the games there so they're saying that this is kind of a way to show that oh we can do you know oh maybe it was because of like the the more you know um
390340	392340	Thank you for watching.
392360	392940	See you next time.
419730	422511	Since the launch, that was less than a year ago.
423291	428613	Bringing the total number of subscribers to the game worldwide to about 5.5 million.
429034	433675	This also just in World of Warcraft will soon be renaming itself to just The World.
435196	438557	That was a .hack joke for those of you guys that didn't get that.
438957	439878	Oh, I get it.
439978	440538	I made a joke.
443939	448481	This is why I do a podcast out of the spare bedroom of an apartment and I don't do comedy.
449762	466135	Uh, Loki, speaking of other things I can't do, one of them is playing Xbox 360, because I still have yet to find one of these little bastards, but that doesn't stop the Xbox 360 news from coming in, and holy crap, do you have a lot of it tonight, starting off with Japan?
466556	467296	Are they buying them yet?
467537	469478	Nope, not buying them in Japan.
469538	471420	In fact, only about 7,477 systems have sold there.
471440	471500	Um...
475908	483151	and I think I mentioned last week that they're being beaten out by every other console system out there, which is pretty bad.
483411	484712	And as far as the U.S.
484752	486753	sales go... Including Gizmondo, believe it or not.
487033	487593	I'm kidding.
487793	488574	Including the U.S.
488634	494036	sales, you know, they've only sold only about 600,000, which is pretty pitiful.
495817	496257	Let's see.
496277	502640	Now, the other thing that we have here is they were kind of going back and forth on whether they wanted a third party... Or not third party.
503521	504021	External...
504781	507102	Blu-ray or external HD DVD drive.
507162	514687	Now, of course, they're backing HD DVD 100%, whether it becomes the format of choice or not.
514787	516668	Wasn't there a little bit of backtracking this week?
516688	518849	It was like, well, we might still do a Blu-ray.
518909	520230	It's kind of like, we'll wait and see.
520630	521731	Are they committing or what?
522071	522671	They're committing.
522691	523212	All right.
523252	525533	So, you know, we'll see.
525653	528615	That's kind of what I'm thinking, but...
529847	542272	Okay, anyways, the other thing is they released a list of the top 10 online Xbox Live Arcade games that are out right now and the most downloads that they've had.
543152	545853	To no surprise, number one, Geometry Wars.
546194	549195	Which is the main reason why a lot of people are actually getting an Xbox 360.
549275	550275	Screw Call of Duty.
550875	551316	Screw it.
551516	551996	Right in the ear.
553288	554309	All these fun, okay.
554489	558172	Now, Gauntlet, number two, the retro Gauntlet.
558272	560754	That surprised me, because I thought Smash TV would have been number two.
560774	562015	Smash TV's number three.
562035	562816	Well, there you go.
562896	564637	Bejeweled 2, number four.
565298	566699	Zuma, number five.
567600	569742	Bank Shop Billiards, which is number six.
570202	575707	Correct me if I'm wrong, Zuma and Bejeweled, two games you can play online for free, right?
576147	576407	Yeah.
576447	578009	Already, okay, just checking.
578089	579590	Do those games offer achievements, though?
580410	581952	Outposts Kaloki Mutant Storm Reloaded Joust
603479	604120	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
622261	622441	All right.
622461	623322	That's pretty much it for now.
623622	623862	All right.
623882	624302	Sounds good.
625003	625583	What else is going on?
649226	651127	Of course, they're getting more units in each week.
651547	659772	It's just, they're surprised, you know, it's taking so long and they're thinking that the, you know, pre-orders will still be there until, like, February.
660292	663814	I'm wondering how many of them are getting cancelled because people are finding them through other means.
663854	667916	There's a lot of people cancelling them, but even still, that's not really affecting anything.
668596	672758	The other thing is there's going to be a major update to Xbox Live, or through Xbox Live.
673539	677921	The main feature that's going to be added to it is a webcam feature, which, you know,
678268	679289	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
706923	707723	Oh, I don't know, Loki.
707743	707963	Halo?
728594	729515	Halo and Halo 2
743368	747449	If you're expecting more games to be added, like Microsoft said, they're going to be adding more and more each week.
747970	749470	I think, again, they're taking a vacation.
749630	754452	You're not going to see any more updates to the backwards compatibility until about March or April.
754492	758653	Hopefully they're taking a vacation down into the factory to build some more Xbox 360s.
759973	760354	It's sad.
760374	765995	They've only had two updates to the whole backwards compatibility thing since launch.
766776	767896	Wasn't it going to be a weekly thing?
768536	771037	Microsoft, learning to disappoint.
772981	773701	Learning?
773961	774822	You mean they didn't already know?
775182	776582	Well, they're perfecting disappointment.
776702	776982	I see.
777622	778643	Some comments from the chatroom.
778823	781804	Wonderdog Harold says, Don't forget that Barbie game is backwards compatible.
781984	782564	Oh, I'm sorry.
782584	783424	All the kids want to play that.
784184	785945	Rini has a response to the webcam thing.
786245	787405	Hooray for webcams.
787465	789466	Let's see people's asses and peni.
790046	793607	Which I think is the plural term for, you know, wang.
793827	793987	Yeah.
795740	822938	www.orangeonestradio.com click on chat by the way to join our chat if you're listening live on Sunday night but our chat room you know our chat room is swinging during the week too as well for those of you guys listening on the podcast because we do other live shows here on Orange Ones Radio Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday night and they're not podcasts we just don't have the bandwidth people so you have to listen live if you want to hear it and we play a whole lot of copyrighted music because we can it's all legal through Live 365 our friends and buddies over there at Live 365 who have been hosting us for so long and taking our money
825575	826636	And now for something completely different.
826656	833301	Another way you can interact with our show is not just through chat, not just through Skype, but there's the old email.
833781	843629	And you send us an email to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and Jamie, she looks in there in the cavernous mailbag and pulls out a few of her favorite emails.
845410	846531	What'd you find for us this week?
846831	851515	Well, we get so many, I have to really be... I try to reply to as many as possible.
851575	853076	Now, it used to be I could reply to everybody.
854685	881322	We's loved Thank you, you guys are awesome, thank you Anyway, we actually, and I wanted to go ahead and give them a shout out Gorilla at 3guys3beers.com They do a podcast Actually wrote in, supporting the Mac Oh, not this again Yes, this again Oh boy I'm going to just read a little bit of this, if I may
882153	883334	Is that all I wanted to say?
883534	884254	Loki, suit up.
884314	885634	Abestos.
885774	887055	I know they're gunning for you here.
887595	888676	All the Mac fans are.
890516	890857	Whatever.
890897	891757	It's just my opinion.
891917	893838	I didn't... Let her speak.
893858	894138	Whatever.
894758	895759	I just like this quote here.
895779	900320	It says, Well, if I drive a dump truck at work, does that mean I have to drive one for my own personal car?
901701	902661	In reference to the PC.
903082	903362	Okay.
905182	906683	You know, it says, Windows has...
908843	909684	I'm going to read this one here.
909724	912467	So if someone is all about games, yeah, Windows has many more.
912487	917292	If someone is about music, podcasting, graphics, internet, pictures, making personal DVDs, movies, Mac is the way to go.
918313	921397	And honestly, I have to agree, I can't wait until I get my Intel iMac.
923622	932069	He also says he can do a Mac with OSX, what he does on his PC, and you can actually customize how your Mac works, so I fully agree with that.
933089	938153	And also, just to read the last full paragraph in here, it's like, well, I've said enough once again.
938213	938634	Great show.
938694	939134	Keep it up.
939494	940035	I like that.
940495	942056	Just don't talk trash about Macs, Loki.
943137	944478	Talk about jumping to the past.
944498	946960	Windows looks just as shitty as it did back in the early 90s.
947020	947881	Can't polish a turd.
950083	950443	Rebuttal?
952230	954292	How many PCs out there are running Windows?
954332	957555	How many are running Mac OS X?
958216	958776	Yeah, I think so.
959357	961459	And all those features that a Mac can do.
961859	963781	Yeah, a PC can do just as well, if not better.
964742	965163	Whatever.
965623	966304	It's my opinion.
966324	966984	I don't care.
967024	968606	You can go ahead and bitch and moan about it.
969006	972450	I will never buy Mac products ever, and this includes iPods.
972910	975773	I'm wondering how actual numbers is opinion.
975993	976834	Actual numbers are facts.
977154	981176	I think I went into the mailbag earlier this week and I was looking at random emails.
981196	982197	I don't know if you're going to read this one.
982217	982817	If you are, I'm sorry.
983097	986659	But there was one email that pretty much simply said something like, you know, I'm a Mac user.
986979	987960	Skye, you're cool.
988000	988580	You moderate.
988640	989581	Jamie, you rock.
989721	990621	Loki, fuck you.
991422	991682	Yeah.
992542	993823	I think I forwarded that one.
994203	995183	I really don't care.
995324	998725	Everyone keeps bringing this up to me because they want me to argue about it.
998765	1000626	And I really don't care if you use a Mac.
1000866	1003548	I'm never going to use it because I don't buy computers based on flavors.
1003628	1003748	So...
1005245	1006686	Subject change, subject change
1030854	1032015	You know, it's funny.
1032596	1033977	I don't have the same thing I had before.
1034457	1037480	I have a sinus infection now, which I'm taking antibiotics for.
1037660	1040022	Somebody wrote to my personal email suggesting you take a vitamin.
1041283	1042584	Me take a vitamin!
1045406	1049530	I mentioned that you used to work for GNC, so you're pretty well up on the vitamins.
1050931	1052592	I thank them for their concern.
1053353	1055595	You attract the fanboys and the bugs.
1056996	1057296	Yeah.
1057677	1058017	Womp womp.
1058833	1071541	Anyway, also we got an email from Press Start about the comment about Tetris.
1072022	1073663	In fact, the email was labeled Tetris is great.
1073683	1078546	It says, yes, every new console released for all eternity should have some version of Tetris.
1078666	1083569	Actually, rephrase, every new console released for all eternity should have the Game Boy version of Tetris.
1084069	1087452	And also Scorched Earth because that game is one of the best multiplayer games ever.
1087672	1087912	Anyway.
1088411	1088871	Amen.
1112327	1114148	So it's still around somewhere.
1114168	1117791	I have Tetranet somewhere on my computer.
1117831	1118692	You only need the program.
1119132	1120833	I wanted to read this paragraph in the letter.
1121053	1121293	Sure.
1122534	1130320	Also, now that you have all this time and you don't have to do your show as if you're playing Daytona USA News Topic Checkpoint, time extended, I have a suggestion.
1130962	1131843	Thank you for watching!
1160953	1162854	Jamie Sort Through That
1184196	1187898	who says, you asked about when we're changing the email addresses.
1187938	1188858	Actually, it's already changed.
1188878	1189918	Just the two go still works.
1190018	1191019	I'm checking all of them.
1191719	1194600	That's why I said I have a whole bunch of email to go through.
1195621	1199762	Also, about Dance Dance Revolution Supernova, is it only going to be in the arcades?
1199802	1203063	Is there any chance of being able to play the new game at home?
1203443	1205804	There are no arcades in there, so it will be pretty hard to play this game.
1206144	1207245	Also, he loves the new format.
1207345	1209346	Having twice as much to listen to each week is awesome.
1209926	1210426	Aw, thank you.
1211124	1214625	But I'm sure that it's a matter of time until we see it.
1214785	1219986	But, you know, it'll be eventually, I'm sure, if it's very popular.
1220566	1221686	Also, one last one.
1223686	1228627	BlazeGamerDude1212 wrote in, said, started listening to the show about two months ago.
1228647	1231588	Has to say that he thinks the three of us are amazingly good at what we do.
1231788	1233388	Aw, hugs.
1233508	1235268	And please continue to do what you are doing.
1235548	1236709	However, I want to correct Loki.
1238869	1245634	He said that the site for the new Xbox Live Diamond is www.xboxlivediamondcard.com and it isn't.
1248456	1260746	After hearing the xboxlivediamond.com site was fake, it went to xbox.com and looked through the site to get the Diamond Card site and it actually is xboxlivediamond.com.
1260926	1261666	Is that still going on?
1262067	1265269	Yeah, they're still advertising even on the dashboard for 360.
1265309	1265809	It's like...
1267494	1270657	I haven't gotten my card, I signed up the first day they had it.
1270677	1272719	Yeah, they'll make those when they make more 360s.
1274160	1279725	A little addition, he also says that for fans of Triple Triad, he found the game online as Google's Triple Triad Gold.
1281787	1282508	Alright, very cool.
1282779	1285902	Did you have the email from the other podcaster that sent us the email?
1286202	1287463	If not, I can pull it up because I read it too.
1287483	1287763	I'm sure I did.
1287783	1288784	I'll go ahead and let you cover that.
1288824	1289044	Okay.
1289224	1295810	I actually received an email from another podcaster, sent us a message, and it was from... Let's see.
1295830	1297171	I've got to find it in here somewhere.
1298011	1308480	It came from Godfrey, who's over at Gamertag Radio, his name in that show, and they wanted to tell us about this segment that was going on that they covered in their latest episode because...
1309020	1310321	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1331815	1333976	I try to stay away from listening to them a lot.
1334677	1335557	Plus, I just don't have time.
1336478	1338299	But I do try to catch the occasional one.
1338319	1344943	So I was listening to this Gamertag Radio, and I listened to their segment, and I thought it was pretty interesting, and I would recommend it.
1345303	1352028	My only thing is that I saw it a little more as a social commentary than necessarily something about games.
1352048	1353468	They do incorporate games into it because...
1355427	1367675	The folks that do this show are other ethnic minorities, and they were kind of talking about that they don't like seeing games like 50 Cent Bulletproof being representations of the community and kind of being pushed there.
1367975	1371137	But they kind of talked a whole lot about other stuff too.
1371157	1372318	I thought it was a very good piece.
1372338	1375840	It was a very smart thing, so I'd recommend it certainly.
1376141	1379903	And there's a lot of minority stuff.
1380515	1387218	groups in America, and I'm sure feel a little bit underrepresented or stereotyped by video games sometimes.
1387378	1388539	So I thought this was a great piece.
1388779	1391560	You know what I also thought was really good about this show, this particular show?
1392541	1395002	The girl they have on that show is really good.
1395362	1408889	And she didn't say a whole lot during this segment, but I was kind of surprised because I expected Gamertag Radio to be mostly about Xbox, because, you know, Gamertag, but she was the one that brought up Nintendo, and she said, you know what, that's why I like Nintendo, because Nintendo...
1409679	1410560	They're just fun.
1410960	1412481	They just put out fun games.
1412601	1426170	I tend to agree that the games I like the best, I think about the two greatest games I played last year, Luminous and Meteos, were puzzle games that have nothing to do with race, color, religion, sexuality, stereotypes, nothing.
1426210	1428312	It's just fun games.
1429212	1431274	You've missed the norm for anything out on GameCube.
1431674	1432555	I like her a lot.
1432615	1435277	You and her need to get together and do a girly show.
1435797	1436517	It would be good.
1437418	1438138	It would be good.
1438179	1438739	It would be good.
1440890	1441550	Go check that out.
1441790	1442330	It's good stuff.
1443371	1444592	Gamertagradio.com, I think.
1444992	1445332	Check it out.
1445632	1446413	Search for them on iTunes.
1447814	1449294	Alright, let's move on here.
1449314	1450475	We're going to go to another topic.
1451256	1457459	And Loki, well, speaking of some of these games that are an insult to some people, 25 to Life.
1458120	1460721	Who hasn't 25 to Life insulted?
1462602	1463563	Well, let's see.
1464423	1466304	Well, no, no.
1466324	1468746	25 to Life, the National Law Enforcement...
1469486	1473687	and Officers Memorial Fund is calling for a boycott of 25 to Life.
1473888	1476048	And not because the game sucked and got horrible reviews.
1477709	1482531	But apparently it's because the game promotes killing of cops and all that stuff.
1482591	1483571	Yada, yada, yada.
1484231	1492694	Basically, they don't like it because the game really has no plot to it and just promotes killing of cops and killing of gangsters and kill, kill, kill.
1493134	1494175	Basic yada, yada, yada.
1494635	1496695	Anyway, so that's all you need to know.
1496735	1498316	It's the same reason why, you know,
1498735	1502417	Jack Thompson gets his paintings in the bunch over Grand Theft Auto and all those other games out there.
1503437	1505198	Is there an actual boycott going to happen?
1505858	1506419	Not likely.
1506479	1508100	In fact, this will probably push sales up.
1508400	1510681	So, way to go.
1511121	1513182	I know very little about this game.
1513582	1514803	What else do you know about this game?
1515003	1518224	25th of Life basically revolves around three characters in the game.
1519645	1523267	For some reason, there's really hardly any missions to it as far as
1524109	1526250	Kill 25 Cops, Kill This, Kill That.
1526311	1531293	You get to play as either cops or gangbangers throughout the game.
1531834	1533575	They have multiplayer on it as well.
1533795	1537857	It was supposedly one of the better games coming out in January.
1538098	1540519	All of two that were good that were coming out.
1540959	1544041	Of course, it ended up getting horrible reviews.
1544101	1547403	I believe, if I remember correctly, IGN gave it a 3.9.
1547443	1550185	I think the highest I've seen for it is a 5 out of 10.
1550245	1550805	Really bad.
1553460	1557977	because it's really buggy and stuff and the graphics suck and
1558527	1561069	2old2play.com A website for gamers over 25
1585774	1586515	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1614953	1616514	Ask any non-gamer and they'll tell you.
1616814	1618816	We're all a bunch of slackers who never grew up.
1618896	1622178	This is an excellent tie-in to other controversial stories this week, right?
1622698	1629863	A bunch of overgrown kids who spend their money on games when there are real ways we could be spending our money, like on minivans with doors that open by themselves.
1630643	1632184	So anyway, the story goes on.
1632224	1637528	It says, any community tends to define itself in some way, so perhaps it's time the gaming community does the same.
1637948	1642271	Gamers are a diverse group, but most fall into one of six categories.
1642967	1645709	I'm going to ask you guys which category you think you fit into.
1645889	1646249	Here we go.
1646289	1647169	Here's the six categories.
1647630	1649751	Hardcore gamers.
1650611	1655874	Hardcore gamers, the average one they say is not married, but they say that's rare.
1656054	1658816	It's just a very small group.
1659756	1662538	They're just essentially hardcore gamers.
1662578	1666560	They know their games and gaming the way that doctors know the bones of the body.
1666620	1670042	Hardcore gamers know it all, and they're proud of their gaming knowledge.
1671251	1673533	Let's see, we have Devoted Gamers.
1673973	1679536	They have the singular obsession, the one game, whatever it may be, like Halo 2.
1680316	1684379	And sometimes Devoted players kind of move around a little bit.
1685699	1690402	And then they have the Addict, who is a very dark subset, they say, of the Devoted Gamer group.
1690462	1695725	The Addict, who gets into one MMORPG and gets addicted to... You know where I'm going with this, right?
1695745	1698787	Because Jamie always used to say, whenever we would talk about Final Fantasy XI.
1700097	1703480	The Pretend Hardcore Gamer Casual Gamers
1723058	1725963	Casual gamers tend to play only those games that get good reviews.
1734011	1735031	and sell a lot of copies.
1735391	1738973	And lastly, I'm sorry, almost last, the clueless gamer.
1739633	1745015	Clueless gamers buy a lot of games where they're not really good at any of them and they give up on them before they become good.
1745335	1753197	These are the gamers who do things that puzzle you, make a lot of mistakes and get pretty frustrated by that, but also aren't willing to listen to suggestions or take any time to improve.
1753518	1755798	And then lastly, the worthless gamer.
1756279	1760420	Cheaters, hackers, de-levelers, punks, jackasses,
1761087	1761808	All that stuff.
1761888	1763849	The people that just go in there to ruin games.
1763889	1764670	The worthless gamer.
1765030	1766131	Which gamer are you?
1766271	1769693	Hardcore, devoted, pretend hardcore, casual, clueless, worthless.
1769873	1770133	Loki.
1771254	1772855	Hardcore and worthless.
1774236	1774756	Why is this?
1775997	1779660	I have to know my game knowledge just for working here.
1780601	1781821	I play a lot of games during the week.
1781861	1783903	Not as much as I used to, but I still play.
1784503	1786384	I always have a game system with me.
1787557	1787817	DarkSakura
1813627	1821334	The categories, just to give me... Sure, hardcore, devoted, pretend hardcore, casual, clueless, worthless.
1822935	1828220	I'd say hardcore for the old school stuff, just because you know my collection.
1828480	1828720	Right.
1831363	1832364	I totally can't see them.
1832464	1835326	Hardcore, devoted, pretend hardcore, casual, clueless, worthless.
1836647	1840511	I'd say I'm pretty devoted to once I get to playing something, because I like to finish it.
1841232	1843935	I'm definitely not a major cheater.
1844036	1844456	Well, okay.
1845017	1850023	I do cheat my way through Silent Hill 3 just because I'm not really playing it for the gameplay.
1850063	1851004	I'm playing it for the story.
1851424	1852165	And the sexy beam.
1853447	1854368	The heza beam!
1855569	1856330	It's the heza beam.
1857632	1859274	But that's just...
1860942	1861302	Nerd Gamer
1880234	1882957	You sound a little bit like a cross between hardcore and devoted to me.
1883157	1883517	A little bit.
1884378	1889963	I would say, I'm kind of somewhere between, you know what's weird is that I think I'm kind of like half devoted, half clueless.
1890384	1899512	The only reason I say I'm clueless is because I'm notorious for my gaming ADD where I will play one game for like a little bit of time and then I go to something else.
1899532	1900973	Like I lose interest and I go to something else.
1901414	1901594	But,
1902034	1904955	When I get devoted into a game, I get really devoted to the game.
1904995	1910478	And I'd say in a way, I just don't think I'm to the line where I can really call myself hardcore.
1910538	1917161	I feel that I do know a lot about games and stuff, but I realize that there's a whole world outside of that too.
1917281	1919482	So I don't know if I can really call myself hardcore.
1919842	1920762	I'm somewhere between there.
1920802	1923504	Because I'd say I'm very devoted to a lot of games too.
1923524	1925084	There's some games that I can never put down.
1925484	1928266	But there's other games I just bounce around a whole awful lot.
1928346	1929046	So I'm somewhere in there.

1957879	1958540	Are you what?
1981812	1982853	The 100th caller?
1982933	1984194	Are you the 100th caller?
1984294	1985855	No, you're the first caller tonight.
1985895	1986476	What's on your mind?
1987076	1987717	Dan, it's Ranma.
1987737	1989338	I was hoping I'd get a free toaster out of this.
1989779	1991340	We might be able to hook you up with that anyway.
1991360	1992261	I'll bring you a toaster.
1992281	1993642	I'll bring you a Hello Kitty toaster.
1993662	1994943	We'll send you a Linux toaster.
1995003	1998346	When I come out for AkatsuCon, I'll bring a Hello Kitty toaster.
1999006	2001108	I'm giving it to my sister at DarkSakura.
2001168	2003049	I already showed you Linux on a toaster.
2003530	2003830	I know.
2003870	2005932	I saw it.
2006092	2009655	First off, I have to ask you, DJ Ranma S, what kind of gamer are you?
2010623	2012184	I'm the casual gamer, okay?
2012464	2014386	Here's a quick example of the hardcore gamer.
2015146	2016327	My friend got Kingdom Hearts 2.
2017308	2018288	He beat the game in two weeks.
2018749	2019409	That's hardcore.
2020190	2020350	Yes.
2020430	2026434	That's almost addiction, but does your other friend go outside and hug a tree once in a while?
2027615	2028475	Actually, no.
2029036	2030777	Well, then maybe he's addicted.
2031057	2031357	I don't know.
2032078	2033199	All right, enough about your friend, though.
2033219	2034900	What made you want to call in tonight?
2035569	2038771	I just wanted to say what's up, how you guys doing, and how much I love the show so far.
2039132	2039772	Well, thank you so much.
2039812	2041653	We appreciate the occasional compliment call.
2041974	2042394	It's good.
2044015	2044776	We're doing good.
2044876	2045996	I'd say I'm doing pretty well.
2046016	2047758	We've been doing a lot of venting tonight, which is good.
2047858	2048918	Oh, I heard.
2048958	2052181	As soon as I got home from Jersey, I jumped onto the stream.
2052201	2056824	I heard DarkSakura foaming at the mouth about a DarkSakura president.
2057725	2061207	What do you think about the whole Flowers for Jack Thompson campaign?
2062268	2063208	I have better things to do with $20.
2063249	2063409	I mean...
2066661	2068222	Let the little maggot run his mouth.
2068362	2068922	I don't care.
2068942	2070382	He's not going to stop me from buying the game.
2071263	2071603	There you go.
2071623	2073083	You can put the $20 down towards the game.
2073103	2073784	That's a very good point.
2074804	2079185	And if he somehow makes it that a game is not coming out, don't worry.
2079565	2081966	Somebody will find a way, and we'll have it.
2082767	2083227	Very true.
2083487	2083827	Very true.
2084427	2086568	Anything else you want to share with our callers tonight, DJ Ranma S?
2087548	2092490	Basically, earlier about the whole Jared Nintendo thing being fat, whatever.
2092510	2093330	Look, get up.
2093666	2095287	Go outside and play.
2096447	2098808	Don't you think they blew his quote a little bit out of context, though?
2099348	2100109	Do you think you really meant it?
2100129	2100529	It's the media.
2100929	2101349	It's the media.
2101369	2103610	They always blow shit out of proportion.
2103710	2104210	Well, true.
2105091	2105751	I can agree with you there.
2107692	2110713	I just let it go, and I just do my thing, and it's good.
2111033	2111353	All right.
2111513	2111933	Sounds good.
2112014	2113694	Ranma, thank you so much for the call.
2113714	2114394	We appreciate it, okay?
2114414	2114755	No problem.
2114875	2115275	You got it.
2115315	2115435	Later.
2115455	2115895	Take care, buddy.
2117116	2117336	All right.
2117376	2118136	Let's go to another call.
2118396	2118696	Hello.
2118716	2119737	You're on Orange Launch Radio.
2120597	2120977	Oh, hey.
2121257	2121477	Hi.
2121517	2121858	Who's this?
2121898	2122038	Um...
2123686	2127628	This is Keith, I'm Ranma, or I'm Ranma on the forums.
2128048	2131950	Alright, Keith, turn down your stream going out.
2133651	2134191	Yeah, I did.
2134611	2137292	Okay, what time do you mind?
2137433	2149178	Actually, I was going to ask you guys a question, since I know that you guys originally started out as really a Bimani radio, a music games podcast radio thing.
2149578	2152700	I wanted to ask, what are your favorite songs to DDR to?
2154525	2155045	Arena of Sorrow Max 2
2183167	2187490	My favorite old school song is Oh Nick Please Not So Quick, because you know, erotic, awesome.
2188190	2190491	Say what you want, don't hate, don't hate, that song's awesome.
2191011	2196855	And my favorite new school song is Skulk by Echo Image in DDR Ultramix 2, because that song is awesome.
2196915	2199996	I love that song, it like totally breathed new life into DDR, love it.
2200937	2202998	Let's go to another call, see if we have some luck over here.
2203118	2204139	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2205319	2207220	It's Legend of Zaku, what's up boss?
2207260	2208721	Hello Zaku, what's on your mind?
2208761	2210062	Hey, did you know we got your poster?
2210894	2214337	Yeah, I sent it over a month ago.
2214457	2216138	Anyways, I finally got 2DX.
2217559	2218480	I know, it was so late.
2218500	2221922	It was so late in the game because I was so poor, but I managed to find the money.
2222262	2223043	No, we love it.
2223123	2223884	We love the poster.
2223944	2224544	It's so awesome.
2224564	2225465	It's hanging here in the studio.
2225525	2227346	It's an In The Groove 2 signed poster.
2228027	2232790	If you listen to our old show, like the old live show we did, you'll understand why that's hilarious.
2232830	2234912	But for now, Zaku, I've got to keep it moving.
2234952	2236433	What brings you to call tonight?
2237506	2240809	Well, if I got 2DX and all, I'm just trying to break into it.
2240849	2241450	Any advice?
2241770	2245853	Because I just started playing that, you know, I think a couple of weeks ago.
2246594	2249877	And so far, I've pretty much poured out 9th style to, you know, to its
2250560	2251241	2DX Beat Mania
2271457	2274839	For years now, there's a whole lot of these games out in Japan.
2274879	2285645	It started with 3rd style, don't ask, but it started with 3rd style and all the way through 10th style now and supposedly 2DX Red on the way as well, which was 11th style, for lack of a better term.
2287166	2292750	A whole lot of these games out there with a hardcore following and finally we're going to be getting a version of it here in America soon.
2293710	2296472	As far as getting started with it, I think the best way to learn
2297671	2311339	I don't think they still have this in the newer styles, but in 5th style and 6th style they had what was called a drill mode, and it would show you how to do certain key patterns, and of course the game uses a turntable and white and black keys, so you play rhythms and make your own beats.
2311539	2320805	And the old 5th and 6th have drill mode, which I think is a great way to learn how to play the game, and sometimes it can be really obnoxious because you have to do a lot of repetition, but it's really good.
2320905	2322206	It gets you really good at the game.
2322226	2322406	Yeah.
2322666	2327991	Yeah, I think I should have gotten that because, you know, 9th style doesn't really have that much except for beginner mode.
2328411	2331074	The only thing I'm trying to do right now is trying to do the ranking.
2332523	2336525	Does Nightstyle have the mode where you can practice the song and slow it down?
2336606	2341188	Yeah, you have those modes where you can actually practice measures in training mode.
2341268	2343730	That's the best way to do it when there's lack of a drill mode.
2343770	2355537	Take a song you can almost pass and slow it down in that mode and work at it, because most of Beatmania is just hearing the rhythms in your head and knowing when to hit the keys, and that's really the best way to be good at it.
2356298	2357238	Anything else on your mind, Zaku?
2357278	2358299	We've got to keep it moving, but...
2359378	2363561	Alright, I guess, you know, just saying what's up and everything.
2363701	2364862	Alright, what type of gamer are you?
2366263	2370666	Basically, I don't think I call myself casual, but I'm like up there.
2370866	2373408	Not hardcore, not really casual, but in the middle.
2373628	2374248	Like devoted?
2374528	2377570	I pretty much have an open mind on many games.
2377710	2378671	Would you say you're devoted?
2379952	2383274	Sort of, I mean, with DDR, yes, and with Bomani also.
2383835	2386656	And then, you know, I also have my first person shooters and my ROMs.
2388258	2389700	and all the other internet things.
2389940	2391102	Yeah, you sound devoted to me.
2391142	2391663	You're devoted.
2392123	2393405	I hear my W devoted.
2394126	2394466	All right.
2395067	2396189	Sakura, thanks so much for the call.
2396229	2396529	Take care.
2396830	2398252	Yeah, anytime, man.
2398272	2398452	Later.
2399429	2401990	All right, thank you guys for your calls.
2402070	2402690	We appreciate that.
2402710	2407072	We're going to keep things moving here on Orange Launch Radio tonight, but of course we appreciate the calls as always.
2407392	2410554	If we have time later in the show, I don't know if we will tonight, but we'll take more calls a little later.
2411694	2416756	Moving on, though, we've got other news, starting off with PlayStation 3 news.
2416856	2418277	Jamie, you have some news on the PlayStation 3?
2419157	2419857	I do indeed.
2421598	2422558	Actually, there's a...
2424525	2440259	It has been predicted that an analyst by the name of Evan Wilson has predicted that the PS3 will launch in November in North America with a summer launch in Japan followed by a March 2007 European launch.
2442061	2450268	However, this conflicts with what a lot of the analysts over here are saying regarding when it's going to be out.
2450428	2450889	However,
2453223	2458308	He's actually gone on, this analyst has gone on to predict volumes for the system as well.
2458969	2464754	He believes that the PS3 will have a million units in Japan in the summer with similar volumes in the US in November.
2465415	2468318	And again, a similar number for the European market.
2469319	2471861	And that it's basically going to exceed the Xbox 360.
2471901	2472081	All right.
2475560	2476120	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2501846	2513390	Okay, basically, the Japanese PlayStation site put up a few links to six games they had up on their site, and then took them down without explanation.
2514851	2521453	So, was it that they said, huh, maybe we shouldn't put them out and just hope they don't notice, or...
2524241	2534490	GameIndustry.biz got something out of a Sony spokesperson that said, we're working on the launch of the PS3 and confirmed a list of titles that will be announced at the appropriate time.
2535952	2538034	I guess that wasn't it, was it?
2538134	2539435	Do you remember what any of those titles were?
2540076	2540236	Sure.
2543679	2547683	According to one of my sources, there was...
2549900	2558405	Genji 2, Angel Rings, Monster Carnival, Everybody's Golf 5, Gran Turismo, and Eye of Judgment.
2559065	2561826	Gran Turismo will be a pretty sweet launch title in this country, I know that.
2562086	2564588	Some we do know of, though, is Metal Gear Solid 4.
2565228	2566549	There was a demo of a Tekken game.
2567469	2570131	And there's still speculation regarding the Final Fantasy franchise.
2570751	2570971	Hmm.
2571591	2572132	Very interesting.
2572412	2575053	Also, there is in development a version of Unreal Tournament 2007.
2575133	2575573	Awesome.
2579306	2607417	I also can confirm this, there was another story that ran on Joystick.com earlier this week Virtua Fighter 5 for PlayStation 3 has been confirmed and it's actually coming from this month's issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly Virtua Fighter 5 is coming to the PS3 and it might be exclusive and then there's a sexy little screenshot but I don't know if that's actually from the game or just something the site put to kind of tag that with but certainly fans of Virtua Fighter of which I know one, and she's in the room
2608773	2609033	No.
2609253	2610173	I thought you liked Virtua Fighter.
2610273	2611294	I loathe Virtua Fighter.
2611414	2611734	Oh, wow.
2611774	2613574	Okay, then I don't know anyone who likes Virtua Fighter, I guess.
2613594	2614574	I'm the Tekken fangirl.
2614694	2618255	I know you like... I thought for some reason you were also... I get the Sega thing.
2619235	2624816	Virtua Fighter made me gag so much when the first ones were out, I was not able to enjoy the series ever since.
2624876	2627097	I'll tell you what Virtua Fighter made me gag.
2627137	2630137	Virtua Fighter 2 on the Genesis, where they took it and made it 2D.
2630157	2630597	Exactly.
2632398	2633818	Except Virtua Fighter Kids was kind of fun.
2634375	2637077	Alright, let's talk more PlayStation 3.
2637157	2641179	Loki, you have some stories about, like, there was, like, a survey going on with PS3?
2641219	2649324	Yeah, there's a survey that's been around, going around, too, basically, because I don't know if anyone's actually played online with the PlayStation 2.
2650024	2652846	It's basically a big clusterfuck of, you know, what's going on.
2652866	2663612	They don't really have a system, it's just kind of out there, and the original idea for Sony for the PlayStation 3 was, hey, it worked before, let's go ahead and do it again, and they're kind of looking at it like,
2664444	2667966	Maybe we should come out with something like Xbox Live.
2668006	2674910	Anyways, so the thing that's going around right now is there are about 33 questions or so asking different things.
2675030	2676911	Like, for example, some things they hint at.
2677171	2679052	A specific lobby only for adults.
2679112	2681233	Would that be something that you'd be interested in?
2681493	2682994	With the sexy iToy plugin.
2684315	2686836	iToy plugin for game lobbies.
2688297	2689838	USB keyboard support.
2690318	2693700	Just, you know, all the standard stuff that you pretty much see in Xbox Live.
2694720	2696201	They're asking, hey, you want this?
2696321	2697302	You know, that type of thing.
2698002	2706408	Which, I mean, begs the question, if they're not going to have USB keyboard support, then why the hell do they have so many USB ports on the goddamn thing anyways?
2706888	2707709	That's what I want to know.
2708029	2713052	So, of course they're going to have USB support for the, you know, keyboard.
2713733	2718216	So that's something that's kind of going on right now, friends lists and whatnot, so.
2719409	2719989	Be interesting.
2720209	2721570	Alright, now, moving on.
2721630	2723170	I think this is PlayStation 3 related.
2723210	2724470	Something about Pioneer?
2725051	2733913	Yeah, Pioneer, the people making the Blu-ray player, they threw out some crazy numbers for what they thought the PS3 launch was going to be.
2734513	2735394	And this, I had to laugh.
2736134	2741135	See, originally, the estimates were 1 million units for launch in the United States.
2741175	2746817	Well, Pioneer is saying that they are going to have as many as 7 million units available for launch in
2748354	2749437	Right.
2749837	2751240	That's a lot of overtime.
2751521	2752122	I don't think so.
2752543	2753505	I mean, let's put it this way.
2755469	2758114	Unless they're planning on launching in 2009, that ain't going to happen.
2759941	2760301	We'll see.
2760962	2761242	All right.
2762083	2767007	Moving on to a completely different topic, but this is somewhat PlayStation related, but it's also Xbox related.
2767968	2769789	New homebrew for the PSP that's not Tetris?
2770190	2770390	Yes.
2771651	2777936	This homebrew is actually a port of a PC game, which is also a kind of a knockoff of Geometry Wars.
2778036	2780298	It's Vector and Vector for the PSP.
2780878	2784842	Very similar to Geometry Wars in the way it plays.
2785162	2788785	Of course, the control scheme is a little bit not as good.
2789326	2792988	as the 360 because you don't have the dual analog on a PSP.
2793548	2795489	But it's really awesome.
2795529	2802272	It's only available, though, for the 1.5 firmware, so hopefully you've got that or you can downgrade.
2803552	2806854	And it's available on your various PSP sites like PSP Updates.
2807834	2808255	Very cool.
2808635	2813097	So for those folks that can't get your Xbox 360 to play Geometry Wars, maybe this is a good substitute.
2813337	2813797	Exactly.
2814117	2818139	And if for whatever reason you can't get a version for the PSP,
2818561	2831753	Remember, there's still the PC version of the game, which is available at bagfullofwrong.co.uk slash games slash vector.html Alright.
2832814	2833394	Now, moving on.
2833454	2835957	Loki, you had some news on Majesco.
2836117	2837999	Something was going on with Majesco.
2838619	2841622	Majesco's getting out of the hardcore gaming business.
2841682	2844224	Basically, they're not making any more...
2846095	2846916	Aeon Flux Aeon Flux
2857188	2858368	Well, that answers a lot.
2859148	2862749	They've canned a couple of the games already.
2862769	2863449	What was in progress?
2863829	2865309	Taxi Driver and Demonic.
2865550	2866090	Oh, that's right.
2866130	2867830	I remember reading the report on Taxi Driver now.
2867930	2871171	Yeah, they're not doing too well as far as stuff that's coming out.
2871251	2880312	I know some of their games are being pulled, but it's probably just they're just looking, you know, self-preservation, so... Yeah.
2880632	2880972	Alright.
2882633	2885193	Speaking of things gone bad...
2886397	2886917	Majesco did Psychonauts
2913602	2919366	Electronic Gaming Monthly, the worst 10, not the top 10, but the worst 10 games ever reviewed.
2919646	2922808	Batman Beyond, number 10, for the PS1.
2923389	2925590	Who Wants to Beat Up a Millionaire on the Dreamcast?
2925610	2927011	That was hilarious.
2927291	2928372	That game was fun.
2928472	2929933	Got a 1.0 score.
2930534	2933936	Powerpuff Girls Paint the Townsville Green for the Game Boy Color.
2934796	2939840	And then right behind that at number 7, Powerpuff Girls Bad Mojo Jojo, also for the Game Boy Color.
2941730	2942751	It was also in the same issue.
2943172	2946156	Kiss Pinball for the PlayStation 1 was number 6.
2946436	2947177	I remember that.
2947257	2948860	The Psycho Circus game.
2950522	2951843	Urban Champion E.
2952737	2954979	Which was for the Game Boy Advance.
2955399	2957521	For some reason, I think they re-released this on the Advance.
2957541	2958642	It was one of their games they put on the Advance.
2958782	2959543	Urban Champion?
2959843	2961725	That game sucked balls on Nintendo.
2961745	2964187	It's like Nintendo's little blemish of the 8-bit era.
2964547	2966929	I mean, who remembers Urban Champion?
2967169	2969391	I mean, like, Hogan's Alley, awesome.
2969611	2974295	Other games, other 8-bit classics made by Nintendo that were forgotten about like that were awesome.
2974315	2975036	But Urban Champion?
2975697	2976177	Easy, forgotten.
2977311	2979432	4.
2977571	2979432	The Guy Game, Loki, Rebuttal, 3.
2979472	2980814	Mortal Kombat Advance, 4.
3001090	3009375	Number two, the number two worst game of all time, according to an EGM list here on 1up.com, The Flintstones Bedrock Bowling.
3009955	3011757	There's a reason why I never heard of that game, apparently.
3012137	3019481	Here's the number one worst game of all time reviewed on EGM, and it's a game I own because it was a gift.
3020182	3025765	Ping Pals for the Nintendo DS was the worst reviewed game of all time.
3026707	3029709	and rightfully so in many ways because Pink Pals kind of sucks.
3029969	3030770	Loki, you're shaking your head.
3030930	3033392	No, I think there's a worse game out there.
3033452	3033852	What's that?
3033872	3037855	This is basically the manos, the hands of fate for PC games.
3037895	3038896	It's called Big Rigs.
3039428	3047372	If you go to GameSpot.com and look for the review on Big Rigs, the game came out... Now, this is not the same as Big Mother Truckers.
3047432	3049133	No, this isn't the same as Big Mother Truckers.
3049493	3055456	You came out... It's a Big Rigs racing game, and the AI doesn't move.
3055936	3059298	The other cars don't move, so it's impossible for you to lose a race.
3060199	3061159	The physics aren't there.
3061199	3062300	You fall through bridges.
3062400	3063700	You can drive off the map.
3064101	3068503	There is no limit to your acceleration, so you can hold down and go a million miles an hour...
3068823	3072145	I was gonna go around and ask, what do you think were things that they missed on this list?
3088988	3089548	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
3119767	3121428	There were games I thought were overrated.
3122128	3128212	I mean, certainly, I like Ridge Racer a whole bunch, but I thought Ridge Racer 6 was kind of overrated.
3130894	3135436	I can't say that there's any that I really dislike that I actually played, put effort into.
3135756	3136637	Fair enough, fair enough.
3136737	3137057	Alright.
3137237	3141040	Oh yeah, Smackdown vs. Raw on the PSP because it gave a noise the hell out of me.
3142496	3143777	Some comments from the chat room.
3144357	3147399	Some folks there are putting in their own two cents here.
3147980	3152422	Funnydale says, Worst game of all time, Back to the Future for the NES.
3153203	3154324	Back to the Future 2 and 3.
3155144	3155544	E.T.
3155604	3155744	on the 2600.
3157365	3158566	I actually played E.T.
3158746	3161728	on the 2600 when I was like six years old and found it entertaining.
3162148	3163829	But of course I was six years old, so you know.
3164050	3165430	And the Smurfs on Click Division.
3165611	3166971	The Smurfs was badass.
3167292	3169093	Hey, I love the Smurfs game.
3169153	3171034	I played that all the time when I was like four.
3172621	3174122	MagMax on the NES.
3174642	3175602	How about Night Trap?
3177123	3177783	What's her face?
3177803	3178383	Dana Plato?
3178423	3179624	Yeah, I know, and she's dead now.
3180084	3180604	Let's see.
3181344	3184385	Raj says, Barney's Hide and Seek for the Sega Genesis.
3185225	3185585	I got one.
3185605	3186346	Spice World.
3186806	3187426	I got one.
3187486	3188646	Spice World's awesome.
3189187	3190267	Non-stop hilarity.
3190927	3193668	Street Fighter 2, the movie, the game.
3194468	3195709	Oh, that takes the cake there.
3196069	3196389	Let's see.
3197789	3199330	Raj says, But But Shaq Fu.
3200259	3200659	Shaq Fu Carnival
3225831	3227031	DarkSakura, Japanese Language is Cake
3257648	3258208	Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
3258228	3258729	I'm just teasing.
3259169	3261710	Well, here's a way you can learn Japanese the fun way.
3261830	3262290	Right, Loki?
3262370	3263411	What's the fun way to learn Japanese?
3264331	3266932	This is learn Japanese with Knuckles.
3267252	3268753	Knuckles from the Sonic franchise.
3268893	3270454	Oh, you mean the Knuckles on my hand?
3270494	3272034	Like, if you get the question wrong, pow!
3272275	3272715	I hit you.
3273135	3274476	No, as in Sonic and Knuckles.
3274716	3283119	Anyways, they have this homemade RPG called Knuckles in China Land, which I don't understand why it's China Land if you're learning Japanese, but whatever.
3283420	3286061	Anyways, basically, you can...
3288604	3310837	They have all of the Hiragana and Katakana symbols in there as well as 6000 kanji and you can actually learn using this game and you can find it at www.kicl.info and it's a free download of course and go check it out.
3311358	3311638	Awesome.
3312721	3314021	The other things, let's see here.
3314261	3317602	Wait, I just have to say Super Pitfall for the NES.
3318102	3319463	Tarnished the Pitfall name.
3319503	3320603	That game is garbage.
3320743	3321583	Absolute garbage.
3323083	3325884	I got it as a present from a family member who didn't know much about games.
3325924	3326804	It was garbage.
3327264	3332325	How about the Sega CD version of Dragon's Lair that was missing scenes?
3333926	3334746	How about anything on the 3DO?
3336238	3338319	The Zelda game that wasn't a Zelda game.
3338399	3339220	Anything on the 3DO.
3339500	3340961	Actually, didn't 3DO have the racing game?
3341041	3342562	Well, forget it.
3342682	3345924	And was anything on the Jaguar with the exception of Tempest 2000?
3346024	3347485	What was it?
3347505	3349707	Tempest X and Defender 2000.
3351508	3351828	Alright.
3352088	3352389	Okay.
3352509	3352849	What else?
3353405	3354546	A couple more things real quick.
3354586	3356367	Sure.
3356487	3359049	This is just hitting the web right now.
3359189	3363192	Multitheft Auto San Andreas 1.0 has finally been released.
3363572	3370937	The PC version of Grand Theft Auto that they've modded to allow multiplayer games in, which I think they should have done from the start.
3371677	3381544	It's available right now if you go to lite.mtavc.com MTA as in Multitheft Auto San Andreas
3382156	3384878	ViceCity.com You can check it out.
3386039	3387420	Looks like it's going to be pretty good.
3388221	3395006	Lots of mirror servers right now because it's being hammered to death but if it's anything like Multitheft Auto, ViceCity it's going to be amazing.
3397087	3397488	So yeah.
3398088	3402471	One last thing of course we've got and we mentioned this before.
3402591	3405974	It's eBay for Animal Crossing.
3406014	3409917	Yes, all those people out there that just really want
3410462	3412283	I gotta have the Metroid.
3412383	3413743	I must have the Metroid.
3440572	3441012	It's amazing.
3441132	3441432	All right.
3442072	3447294	Well, we're about ready to wrap up the show here, but I have to respond to a chatter real quick because we do have this interactive thing going on.
3447574	3450735	Funny Dale says in the chat room here, I got news for you, Sky.
3450935	3454656	All Pitfall games that came out after the first one have charnished the name of Pitfall.
3454976	3455436	No, no, no, no.
3455576	3462518	Pitfall 2, the Mayan Caverns on Atari 2600, one of the only Atari 2600 games to feature background music.
3462878	3463818	That game was badass.
3464358	3467679	I enjoy it more than the first one, but the first one is a legendary game.
3467899	3472920	I do love that game a lot, so I have to disagree with you there, but maybe you just forgot, so I'll let it slide.
3473640	3476500	But yeah, a lot of the other ones that came out after that were garbage, but we'll see.
3477120	3479081	Anyway, that's all I have to say.
3479501	3480741	Loki, any last-minute stories?
3481061	3483461	I notice you're ruffling through the pages of the internet right now.
3484161	3487242	Yeah, well, just a little fun little thing here.
3487362	3492963	They have... Everybody loves, you know, the prince from Katamari.
3493610	3496751	and now you can make your very own prints to put on your desktop at work.
3498011	3501773	They have a paper model actually you can download and print out and make.
3502273	3518838	It's at fccafe.fc2web.com slash ptamacy.html and go check it out and they've got your own little prints for you.
3519418	3519678	Cute.
3520646	3521867	Alright, it's time to wrap it up.
3522127	3524728	I think we've had ourselves a good show tonight, and I think it's time to end it.
3525108	3526409	So now it's time to get our final thoughts.
3526869	3529431	Next week on the program, everybody, we're going to have an interview.
3529651	3531592	I think it is happening for sure next week.
3531692	3532532	It's going to be awesome.
3532833	3537535	We're having a rep from GameTap here, the service that we talked about a couple shows ago.
3538236	3540337	Going to be talking about GameTap and the plans for the future.
3540417	3541978	Should be awesome, so stay tuned for that.
3542878	3544099	That'll be next week here on the show.
3544219	3546100	Other exciting interviews coming up soon, we hope.
3546500	3547120	We'll see what happens.
3547621	3549081	Now let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
3549322	3550102	Loki, your final thought.
3551059	3555822	My final thought is I'm going to actually play through all of Ridge Racer so I can get good to play online.
3557063	3557964	Ridge Racer 6, of course.
3559625	3566309	My final thought is I'm craving to go play some Pitfall 2 very soon because I thought about that game just now with this show and it was so awesome.
3566950	3567350	DarkSakura.
3567370	3570452	And that's another one of those games that look better on the Commodore 64 than it did on Atari, just so you know.
3570692	3571133	DarkSakura.
3571373	3575115	Tonight we hook up the duo and actually play Space Fantasy Zone.
3575856	3576856	You have to tell us about it next week.
3577197	3577417	I will.
3577637	3578377	I'll give my review.
3578818	3579078	All right.
3579795	3582756	That's it from us here at Orange Lounge Radio to you guys.
3582857	3586538	Have a wonderful week and we'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.
