Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of January 9th, 2006.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:13,300
You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

3
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:18,000
Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Skye, and Logan.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,900
Hello, everybody, once again, and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,600
It's that podcast dedicated to what gamers really want to know about.

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,300
We here at Orange Lounge like to talk about games that don't suck,

7
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,300
But sometimes, you know, we'll tell you about a couple that do suck just to tell you to stay the hell away.

8
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,300
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Sky. My awesome co-hosts are here.

9
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,300
Say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,300
Hello.

11
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,300
How you doing?

12
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,300
Okay.

13
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,300
Yeah?

14
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,300
Yeah.

15
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,300
Well, good.

16
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,300
Now, before when we were taping our live show earlier this evening, you were a little sickly, but you're feeling better now.

17
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,300
It was that horrible Chinese food. I don't think that my body can process that type of stuff anymore.

18
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,480
stuff anymore. We went to this horrible Chinese buffet for dinner tonight and it

19
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,980
was just it was cheap but the food you know it's just it's the grossest of the

20
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,800
gross Chinese food but you know oh well it wasn't even that filling yeah anyway

21
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,160
Loki suddenly we're the Food Network Loki is over there in that corner the

22
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:15,200
other co-host how you doing? Hopefully good because that speaking of Chinese

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:21,040
food place the beef that was for the Mongolian barbecue type stuff wasn't

24
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,440
frozen. It was quite raw and sitting there out in the open. That seems like a health

25
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:31,320
code violation to me, but okay. So if I'm dead tomorrow, we'll know why. So this will

26
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,320
be the last episode with Loki. On a serious note, though, what this is the last episode

27
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,520
of, in case you missed the announcement last week, is it was kind of buried in the middle

28
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,640
of the show. We just want to kind of get out there in the beginning of this week. The show

29
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,240
will be changing next week. We're going to be fusing what we do here with the podcast

30
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,120
with what we've been doing for three and a half years on our live program, and we're

31
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,200
actually gonna be taping this podcast live and since it's going to be two

32
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,300
hours in length that means you guys are gonna get two podcasts throughout the

33
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,000

38
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,800
It's gonna be great. All right, let's go ahead and I get started first off. How was your gaming week?

39
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:27,520
We always want to know, you know, what's been going on in our world. So dark Sakura. What's going on in your gaming week?

40
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,700
Um, I've been playing Animal Crossing really

41
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,500
Dance been playing a lot of of course need for speed underground most wanted blah blah

42
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,200
I'm getting really tired of seeing that game. Um, otherwise, I've been reading books

43
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:47,200
Well, to enrich your mind once in a while. You ever played text adventure games? Like Zork, you remember those old school games?

44
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,200
Oh, I used to play Gemstone 3.

45
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,200
Oh, okay. I never played that one.

46
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,200
Back when I was a geek on AOL.

47
00:02:52,200 --> 00:03:00,200
What about like the middle range, like when text games kind of evolved into graphical games and what adventure games are today, like King's Quest, Space Quest?

48
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,200
I played King's Quest IV a little bit, but I just couldn't get into that.

49
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,200
Oh god, King's Quest IV was my favorite.

50
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,200
Actually, I played Loom, but Loom was more sort of a combination.

51
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,200
Yeah, there wasn't so much text at that point, but yeah, that's cool.

52
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,200
So, um, Loki, how was your gaming week?

53
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,200
It was, um, pretty good. I've been trying to play a lot more in the 360.

54
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:31,200
Um, of course, I've been playing my normal games, um, Animal Crossing DS every day, and then playing, um, what also, Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories,

55
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,180
stories which I'm very excited to hear that they're coming out with a PS2 version of that

56
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:41,240
game and a new PSP version of Grand Theft Auto at some point this year.

57
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,160
Then of course I got to try a few things on the 360.

58
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,960
First off I've been playing Call of Duty 2, the single player mode in that, and that game

59
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,960
is amazing.

60
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,900
It's just really awesome.

61
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,980
It does though, I'm playing on the easiest difficulty because I'm not very good at these

62
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,440
military first person shooters that involve actual realistic damage to your character

63
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,700
and stuff like that where a single bullet can kill you type thing.

64
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,180
So I've been actually kind of just running through it kind of like Rambo and just doing

65
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,180
it that way.

66
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:12,300
It works every now and then and a lot of times I get killed but still a very fun game in

67
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:18,540
that sense and it is very realistic just I don't know it makes you feel like this would

68
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,540
be how I would be able to handle a gun if I were actually in World War II which is not

69
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,980
very well.

70
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:30,540
The other thing I've been playing was Fight Night Round 3, a demo for that actually came

71
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,940
out on Xbox Live's Marketplace this week.

72
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,940
And that game's pretty cool.

73
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,900
I'm not really into the boxing games, but I do enjoy a game where it involves beating

74
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,580
someone else up.

75
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,780
And what they've kind of done that's, you know, actually in the demo video that they

76
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,980
have for it, when you're throwing out a knockout punch it goes into kind of slow-mo and you

77
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:53,020
see the guy's face contort from you hitting it and he spits out blood.

78
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,020
But really cool game.

79
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,460
It sounds like Matrix Boxing.

80
00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:01,460
Sort of, but it's very, very cool. It should be a cool game. I know I think Round 2 was

81
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:06,380
really popular, so it shouldn't be any different. Other than that, I did play a little bit of

82
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:12,500
online multiplayer for Call of Duty 2. It's okay, but do not bring up the guide when you're

83
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:17,060
playing the game online. I accidentally hit the button trying to hit pause to change my

84
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:23,140
weapon on it, and my game started glitching out like crazy after that. So that's something

85
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:27,020
got a fix but um... and the other thing was the server was full this morning so I

86
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,240
couldn't play online

87
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,600
and that kinda sucked

88
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,120
and I haven't figured out a way to get my friends to play the same game with me

89
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,680
and that

90
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,040
also is frustrating. It's a lot of frustrating stuff with Xbox Live

91
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,800
Well on the regular Xbox it's just fine. I don't know what your problems are with this.

92
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,840
It's all new.

93
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,880
Yeah.

94
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,280
Well also you're kind of a new Xbox user so maybe there's stuff you're missing.

95
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,800
Exactly. I don't know what the hell I'm doing and a lot of times I've got my... the only other person I have

96
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,920
that's actually playing with me is one of my customers, because I do, you know, game

97
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,680
sales at work, and one of my customers got a 360, so I've been talking with him, voice

98
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,200
chat and stuff, which doesn't work well because I use headphones at the same time, too, so.

99
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,880
But I don't know, we've been trying to play a game with each other, Call of Duty, but

100
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,880
that didn't work.

101
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,880
Perfect Dark's probably going to be the one that'll work for us.

102
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,480
Well, somebody finally got the upright idea to start a gamertag thread on the Orange Launch

103
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,120
Radio Forum, so if you want to start playing with some of our listeners, there's tons of

104
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,880
gamertags over there on the forums, so try to check that out.

105
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:26,880
I added some of them, it'll be fun when I get my 360 at some point.

106
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:33,880
My gaming week, I didn't play a whole lot of new stuff. I went out and I got Amplitude for $10

107
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,880
because I had borrowed that game from another friend of mine for like a year

108
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,880
and finally I just had to buy my own dang copy, which is great.

109
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,880
It's a great game. It's one of the most underrated PS2 games of all time.

110
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,880
That's another reason why I'm excited for Eastpop's going to be here next week because they contributed to that game.

111
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,200
Also, I picked out a copy of Burnout,

112
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,400
which is an Xbox's greatest hit series.

113
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,600
Burnout Takedown? No, Burnout 3.

114
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,480
Same thing. Same thing, whatever. It's the takedown one. I picked that up.

115
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,480
It's fun. I like it. I picked that up solely based on the fact that Loki never

116
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,400
shuts up about this game on our little show.

117
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,480
And it usually is not the type of game I would think about playing,

118
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,920
but it looks so pretty on my HD. Even for Xbox 1.5, it looks very nice.

119
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,560
you know, and why did I call it Xbox 1.5? I have no idea.

120
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,520
Oh, because I have the Halo thing, so sometimes I joke that it's not really the first

121
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,520
Xbox, it's like the 1.5. Anyway, also some people call it the 360, but

122
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,520
it's a fun game, I like it, I like making car wrecks.

123
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,120
I have actually been having trouble with Xbox Live on that game as well, though,

124
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,040
so it's kind of interesting. Although, I know I'd get my ass kicked if I tried to play a lot

125
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,120
online, so I don't really.

126
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,720
I need an actual steering wheel to really get the feel for that game, though, it's just

127
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,200
The controller is not the same to me. I can't drive with the controller on that game.

128
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:54,040
But otherwise it's been the same old stuff. Not a whole lot of new stuff. I've been playing a lot of

129
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,200
Animal Crossing and Partners in Time

130
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,520
which I talked about a couple weeks ago on the show, Mario and Luigi

131
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,520
for DS. Well what's ironic is I'll be quitting

132
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,720
Final Fantasy XI at some point here. I haven't really set a date yet when I'm going to cancel my account.

133
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,440
But I'm also going to be participating in the beta for Final Fantasy XI on the 360.

134
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,720
That's why I want to get

135
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,160
my xbox 360 I want that I want in on that beta

136
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,840
had a it's gonna be pretty in HD is we so pretty

137
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,160
I'll bring it over that's not good enough I wanna play I wanna

138
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,560
I wanna start from the beginning I'm glad I quit that game you can

139
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,960
kiss my booty that's okay I don't know where it's been

140
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,240
so well that kinda leads us into a news item here we got the Final Fantasy 11

141
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,400
demo is coming to the US can't you sign up for it now

142
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,520
Yeah, they have the sign-ups for right now to get your content ID numbers, basically,

143
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,160
you know, the registration codes that you need.

144
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,160
Are they going to close it?

145
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,160
Should I go and sign up even though I don't have an access ID?

146
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,160
You probably should.

147
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,160
Okay, I will.

148
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,980
So go sign up right now if you haven't yet.

149
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,040
The demo CD, I'm not sure the other ways to get it.

150
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,760
I do know that it's going to be in the official Xbox magazine, the February issue.

151
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,880
They're going to have that, but I think there's other ways to get it if you're not subscribed

152
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,960
or don't want to buy it.

153
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,660
Have they talked about the limitations of the beta?

154
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,620
Because obviously it can't be the full game.

155
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:17,900
It's the full game, just not the new patch, the new treasures or whatever it is.

156
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,620
But it is the full game so far.

157
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,620
Wow!

158
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,620
Isn't that going to be for free?

159
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,100
You're going to be running on the demo servers right now, the beta servers.

160
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,900
So you're not going to be playing with everybody else.

161
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,700
You will be playing though with people from Europe and Japan.

162
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:38,420
It's going to be the full game until the game comes out and then you can...

163
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,380
But what they're saying, and I'm not sure if this is actually true, is you can transfer

164
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,020
your character from the beta to the actual game.

165
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,020
That would be interesting.

166
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:51,740
So like if you get really far, you can transfer your level 50 character over, which would

167
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,740
be cool.

168
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,900
I don't know if that's going to actually happen, but we'll see, we'll see.

169
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,420
Alright, anyway, let's go into the real top story tonight.

170
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,780
We're actually going to go over to Dark Sakura, and because this is pretty big, it's a little

171
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:08,540
bit of a follow-up to I think something we sort of hinted at before but it's

172
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,940
finally happened two major gaming companies coming together this is what

173
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,500
like the fourth time this has happened in the past year it's crazy Dark Sakura

174
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:20,540
tell us about this this is the theme of 2005 and we're getting more of it as of

175
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:30,340
officially January 4th Namco and Bandai are one and so now it's Namco Bandai

176
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:36,960
Holdings USA Incorporated owns Bondi Namco Group US subsidiaries including

177
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:43,620
Bondi America, Bondi Entertainment, Namco America Incorporated, Namco

178
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,560
Cybertainment Incorporated being the arcades and Namco Networks America

179
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,920
Incorporated that's the mobile game unit and Namco Bondi Games America for the

180
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,880
video games. It's very interesting because we're slowly seeing this shift

181
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,620
now where there's only going to be like a handful of major gaming companies

182
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,780
because they're all buying each other out.

183
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,780
Very interesting.

184
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,500
Trying to get the upper hand on the market.

185
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,220
I guess so.

186
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,220
Be interesting.

187
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,900
One day they're all going to be bought by one of the folks, or they'll put out their

188
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,140
own consoles, and then who knows?

189
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,140
Who knows?

190
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,140
All right.

191
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,760
Loke, you have some news from the Consumer Electronics Show, right?

192
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,760
What was going on now?

193
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,860
I heard about some new attachment for the 360.

194
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,860
It's going to be pretty big.

195
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,980
Well, there's a lot of stuff going on.

196
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:29,380
Obviously, they're showing off the new video technologies, both HD DVD and Blu-ray, and

197
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:38,100
And of course, Sony being behind BluRay, then that means that Microsoft has the HD DVD,

198
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:45,420
and so they're actually going to be selling an add-on unit for the Xbox 360 for HD DVD.

199
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,900
It's going to be HD DVD Drive.

200
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:52,560
The only catch is, it's only for HD DVD movies, not games.

201
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,760
So unless you're thinking, oh hey, more storage space for these upcoming games, then again,

202
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:04,980
not gonna happen so... No, it's that same issue the Xbox 360's didn't come default packed

203
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,460
in with the hard drive so now not every game can support the hard drive because not everybody

204
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:12,460
has one. Same thing with the HD DVD. I still think though that they can. They just, you

205
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:16,140
know, make it so that you have to have the hard drive when you... It's risky. I mean

206
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:21,020
Final Fantasy XI is gonna have to do it but it's still risky. Yeah. So, I don't know.

207
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:24,380
That's one of the things that they've got so far. I think it's stupid because, you know,

208
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:28,380
if I'm gonna get an HD DVD player, I'll just get a standalone player. Why do I need that?

209
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:33,380
an add-on for the 360, which is probably going to be overpriced like the hard drive.

210
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:38,100
This is going to be pretty messy going into this year with Blu-ray versus HD DVD because

211
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:43,400
there is no clear winner yet, and the consumer is going to have to choose early on, so somebody's

212
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
going to lose.

213
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,260
I think really what's going to end up pushing it is going to be the release of the PS3,

214
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,060
because it has a Blu-ray player in it already.

215
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:55,980
A lot of people used the PlayStation 2, whether it was a good idea or not, for their DVD player,

216
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,460
this it's going to be in the package you're gonna get your gaming system and

217
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:03,380
blu-ray player for you know like four hundred five hundred dollars or whatever

218
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:07,820
and that way you don't buy this separate add-on thing after you've shelled out

219
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:12,980
four hundred dollars for the 360 now to shell out 100 $200 for this add-on screw

220
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:17,820
you guys I mean no I don't think so so either that or just buy a Toshiba player

221
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:22,660
that has supports both I mean that'd be the best way to do it that's a good

222
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:28,540
Alright, so what about some of the games that were over at Consumer Electronics Show, Logan?

223
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:33,100
One of the things that they were showing off actually in the Dolby Digital booth was Burnout

224
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,580
Revenge for the 360, and wow does it look sexy.

225
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,260
So they actually had a few screenshots.

226
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,740
It was playable though.

227
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:45,100
They said that they've added, it's basically built from the ground up, they've got more

228
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,260
detailed models that actually show damage to the cars and stuff, as well as they've

229
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,500
added ten crash junctions.

230
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,820
It's basically going to be just a really nice, pretty looking version of Burnout Revenge,

231
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:02,060
hopefully with some better single player mode stuff in there, like Burnout 3, but yeah.

232
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:06,260
Basically expect it to be really awesome, it is going to be coming out in March.

233
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,260
Awesome.

234
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,080
One other thing I know they announced at the Consumer Electronics Show, some expansions

235
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,580
coming to Xbox Arcade?

236
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,420
Yeah, definitely.

237
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:18,220
With Xbox Live, the arcade is just awesome to begin with, and this of course, you know,

238
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:23,620
one of the hugest games in the arcade scene. Street Fighter II is coming to the arcade

239
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:29,240
and they're doing some pretty cool stuff with it. Like for example, they've got this kind

240
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,620
of coin-up mode. I heard about this, the quarter mode it's called. I heard about this, this

241
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:40,740
is pretty crazy. Exactly, and it's kind of basically this new thing created for Xbox

242
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:47,740
live arcade. You can actually do a spectator based system where you get to watch people

243
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:54,220
play and stuff like that and you can buy into player matches and stuff. They've got, basically

244
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:58,740
the quarters are used to represent players and pays homage to the arcade type thing.

245
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,380
Voice chat, which is kind of cool because it will bring back the trash talking from

246
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,380
the arcade.

247
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,100
Oh, just what we need on Xbox live, more trash talking, thank you.

248
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:12,380
And then they also have a gaming lobby to watch the brawls and stuff like that.

249
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:16,020
You can do an Opti-Match, which is good player matching stuff.

250
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:21,740
Training mode, of course CPU battles, arcade mode, which is kind of like the arcade type

251
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,740
of thing.

252
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:29,860
They have best characters, rankings on which character is the most popular, monthly rankings,

253
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,860
and just a whole new thing.

254
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,860
They're going to have...

255
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,340
Or a game that's over 10 years old.

256
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:38,060
Exactly, and 5.1 surround sound, which is, I guess, kind of neat. I don't know what they'd

257
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:43,180
be doing with it, but I don't know. Personally, I think this is one of the best things coming

258
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:49,100
to the Xbox Live Arcade. I'm not a huge fighting fan, but it's awesome. I mean, Smash TV was

259
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:49,940
great to begin with.

260
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:54,020
Oh, exactly. And I'm hoping that more of this stuff comes to the arcade, and they're talking

261
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:58,700
about maybe one of the rumors was Ninja Turtles arcade games. So, let's get some actual, like,

262
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,720
maim stuff on here. That'd be fucking awesome.

263
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,040
I think I would personally be happiest if we got Turtles in time.

264
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,360
Either of the Turtles games, or I'm thinking the X-Men game.

265
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:13,500
Dude, with Gazzler. That X-Men thing was huge! It was like six players.

266
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,520
I was all over that machine with two screens.

267
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:21,160
Hell yeah, that was an awesome game. That would be fun to have. See, you could do that on HDTV. It would be fun.

268
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,960
Alright, here's something else coming out of Consumer Electronics Show, and

269
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,280
I love this because I grew up on the Commodore 64.

270
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:35,200
Well get this, Commodore International Corporation now owns this brand and they are going to

271
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,320
be releasing something called the Commodore Combo.

272
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,920
It's going to have five games included and another 90 approximately available for download

273
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,920
online.

274
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,040
A 20 gigabyte hard drive running Windows CE.

275
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,920
So Commodore is coming back in this like handheld thing and I'm assuming that maybe some of

276
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,460
the great Commodore 64 classics will be coming to this system.

277
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:03,100
not great Gianna sisters, but maybe we would have some of the other great Commodore 64

278
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,100
games.

279
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,220
Oh man, the Commodore 64 was such an awesome system.

280
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:10,540
Like a lot of games that were on Atari 2600 were on the Commodore 64 as well, but better.

281
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:16,060
Like H-E-R-O, I think I'm off the top of my head, just, oh man, I just, I grew up, like

282
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:20,060
that was my gaming system when I grew up, was Commodore 64, so I'm excited about this.

283
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,060
It's cool.

284
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,940
I want to see Jumpman Junior, I want to take that on handheld.

285
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:23,940
I love Jumpman.

286
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,940
Awesome.

287
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,940
Jumpman, Jumpman Junior, whatever.

288
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:29,140
I want I want my impossible mission on the go so I get that

289
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:36,780
Forget it bad joke. Jumpman was one of my favorites. Jumpman was awesome

290
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:42,420
Whatever happened to Epics. Are they still around? I don't know. We'll get an email for that now that I asked that. All right, um

291
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:48,900
Let's go over to Jamie and check in on what's going on with Miyamoto. What's so going on in the Miyamoto world?

292
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:52,020
Okay, let's go ahead and take a look at this

293
00:17:52,020 --> 00:18:04,500
This would have to do with a game called Odama coming out for the GameCube.

294
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:11,900
Actually it's a nod to Utsaito, who bought a Seaman, who remembers talking to your fish

295
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,080
on the Dreamcast.

296
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,220
I never played that game.

297
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,080
I played Seaman.

298
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,420
Actually more specifically, Dan played Seaman and I would ask him foul questions.

299
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,460
No, I thought C-Man was coming back.

300
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,140
I thought that they were going to remake that or something.

301
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,620
So, Jamie, are you saying you enjoy playing with C-Man?

302
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:32,620
I'm going to hate you.

303
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,860
Okay.

304
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:41,780
But basically, you know, Nintendo was really slow to sort of take on to the idea, but the

305
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:46,020
premise behind it is that it's a military pinball game set in feudal Japan, where you

306
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:52,300
you knock down barriers, run over enemies, use a microphone to issue vocal commands.

307
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:57,940
It seems kind of odd to me, I would rather have another C-Man, but you know.

308
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:02,860
I seem to remember seeing this game at E3. Didn't they show this at E3? I think I remember

309
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,580
a game like this with a microphone. I'm almost positive.

310
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,660
I was hanging out at the Xbox place.

311
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,540
I remember, hang on, I'm almost positive I saw this game. It looked very interesting,

312
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,740
but it was in its early stages still.

313
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:19,140
I also think that there's a neat little mention here that Miyamoto's favorite game of all

314
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,140
time is Pac-Man.

315
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,140
Interesting.

316
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,140
Yep.

317
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,140
Interesting.

318
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:27,780
Um, speaking of the DS, well, that's not really a DS, but speaking of, you know, Nintendo

319
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:31,420
and something that's going to be happening with the DS, Contact is a new game currently

320
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:36,660
in development and it is actually being produced by the same director who produced Capcom's

321
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,660
Killer 7.

322
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:41,920
Okay, it's about a boy named Cherry who's tasked with helping a nutty professor find

323
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,480
all the lost components of a spaceship but here's the thing

324
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,400
it's not just any regular RPG they're saying it's going to use the Wi-Fi

325
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,200
service

326
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,000
so it's not necessarily an MMO

327
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,200
but somehow this RPG is going to interact with the Wi-Fi service. We don't really have

328
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,680
the details yet but it just goes to show that

329
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,880
the DS could be an interesting platform for these type of like imagine like an

330
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,440
MMO style game on the DS

331
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,520
and you know I was thinking aloud about this and the possibilities of having like an

332
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,200
MMO style thing on the DS and I thought

333
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,160
you know what MMO would be perfect for the DS?

334
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,840
Ragnarok Online. Ragnarok Online on the DS would be awesome.

335
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,760
That would be hot. You know it's on something.

336
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,960
It's perfect for the DS.

337
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,040
I should patent this idea except I didn't create Ragnarok Online so I can't.

338
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,760
Well what's funny too is when you think about it that

339
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,640
the PSP even though it's you know they... one of the features is

340
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,000
yeah you can browse on the internet with it and stuff. There's not a lot of games that

341
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,080
actually use

342
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,880
the, you know, gameplay over the internet. It's all like localized

343
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,120
wireless play. That's it. It's kind of lame.

344
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,560
Well, what, you know, it's funny because Dark Sakura actually has a story coming up on

345
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,440
what the PSP has in store

346
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,760
for this next year. So Dark Sakura, what's going on with Sony's

347
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,280
future for the PSP? Well, there's

348
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,360
coming up a location-free TV service

349
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,960
coming up. What it will do is it will connect with

350
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:16,080
PC, TV, and PSP allowing access streamed audio, visual, you can watch broadcasts over the

351
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,840
internet using this built-in player you'd be able to do it from anywhere with a Wi-Fi

352
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,080
hotspot.

353
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:29,600
Also coming out is a new version of the PSP media manager so that it will make the transferring,

354
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,000
converting all those files a lot simpler.

355
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,680
I know that that caused some issues with people because it goes to wet MP4 format.

356
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,120
So they're going to relaunch their iTunes like Connect to Music download service in

357
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,800
March so that you can download game content.

358
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,680
Actually with the version 2.5 firmware that came out a few months back...

359
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,160
Aren't they on 2.6 now though?

360
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,560
They are on 2.6.

361
00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:01,320
With 2.5 came the location free player ability now with the PSP.

362
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,760
The only problem is the location free player hardware part that you need on your PC or

363
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,760
your TV.

364
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,840
It's about $300 ouch. So

365
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:16,620
All right. Well, not only do we have stuff going on with the new school systems, but you know, it was exciting

366
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,140
We had the Commodore 64 news. Well, okay

367
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:24,600
It's not really Commodore 64 but Commodore in general coming back from the dead get this the Sega Genesis is coming back from the dead

368
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:29,600
And you know, we've had a lot of these stories lately about you know, Sega's kind of doing all these interesting things

369
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,760
Well, okay Sega themselves is not doing this

370
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:39,400
But there is a new Sega Genesis game coming out a brand new Sega Genesis game, and it's called beggar Prince

371
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:46,380
There has not been a new Sega Genesis game in America since 1998, but now there's going to be a brand new game

372
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,960
It's called beggar Prince

373
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,300
Essentially it's a little bit of a role-playing game

374
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:56,080
It's about a prince who gets out of the castle, but is disguised as a beggar now. Here's the thing though

375
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,780
It was actually released originally in Taiwan in

376
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:06,760
1996 so they've actually just translated this to America you know to English and

377
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:12,420
gonna be releasing it here in America you can now pre-order the game for $46

378
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:17,100
and it'll be out spring of this year so I don't know for some Genesis loyalists

379
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:21,780
though I might be worth it but $46 seems a little high to me you know Genesis

380
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:26,280
that's what they cost Neil yeah well I mean but but that was you know the

381
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:30,680
technology so far ahead I could get a I get a PlayStation 2 game or a you know

382
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:36,760
xbox game for 46 bucks but I don't know I suppose it really doesn't matter it

383
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:42,320
just depends on how good is the game is the game fun so we'll find out so

384
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,800
apparently it's got great graphics though and there's a really interesting

385
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,160
innovative combat system so if we manage to get a hold of this game will let you

386
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:55,320
know how it is and a follow up on it a little bit later let's now go over and

387
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:00,040
go over to DarkSakura for a little bit. You know, DarkSakura has been doing this for the

388
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:07,120
Youth of America for a long time now, is that she likes to share with you guys her advice

389
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:13,120
column. And, you know, it's important to understand that there's a whole world out there outside

390
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,880
of gaming, because if we just sat indoors and played games all day long, we'd have no

391
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,320
time to go outside and, you know, look up at the sky and wait for a tour.

392
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,000
We'd have no time to go out and stick our tongue to freezing poles.

393
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,840
exactly but I guess now this whole fun adventure is coming to an end

394
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,580
with us going to the new format next week and everything so

395
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:36,320
Dark Soccer has decided it's time to move on from the advice column

396
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,260
we have bigger and better coming. That's right there's bigger and better features

397
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,040
coming instead so this is the

398
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:45,500
final advice column from Dark Soccer. Dark Soccer what are you going to tell the kids about

399
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,700
today? Today's bit of advice

400
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:52,180
How to treat a tongue stuck to a frozen pole

401
00:24:52,180 --> 00:25:00,180
1. Do not pull the tongue off the pole. Pulling sharply will be very painful.

402
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:08,180
2. Move closer to the pole. Get as close as possible without letting more of the tongue's surface area touch the pole.

403
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:14,180
3. Warm the pole with your hands. A tongue will stick when the surface of the pole is very cold.

404
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:18,180
A few top layers of the tongue will freeze when it touches the pole, causing bonding.

405
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:23,060
Place your gloved hands on the area of the pole closest to the tongue. Hold them there for several minutes.

406
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,940
4. Take a test pole.

407
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,220
As the pole warms, the frozen area around your tongue should begin to thaw.

408
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,380
Gently pull the tongue away from the pole.

409
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:35,140
You may leave a layer or two of skin on the pole, which will be painful, but the tongue will quickly heal.

410
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:39,700
And my last piece of advice? You'll shoot your eye out? Stay inside and play more video games.

411
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:45,380
Or if you've got a friend, get some warm water. No! Play video games!

412
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:49,120
and then go out drinking sometime so you've basically rendered the past fifty

413
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,720
four uh... advice columns completely useless with your little no sign play

414
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,360
games and somebody is stuck on a runaway camel

415
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,880
now right

416
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,240
but i think it

417
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,320
you know no one's ever going to follow my advice anyway as good as it is

418
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,080
so

419
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,320
just go play more video games alright you're less in danger of getting stuck

420
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:13,240
to a frozen pole or being on a runaway camel goodbye dark stalker's advice

421
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,080
column

422
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,760
We hardly knew you, or we were hardly listening.

423
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,520
Just teasing.

424
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,160
Love you.

425
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,480
All right, let's go on over to Loki.

426
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,400
Loki's got some stuff going on in the PSP homebrew world.

427
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,840
Was this one of the biggest games ever coming to the PSP?

428
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,000
Something like that.

429
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,880
Basically, Quake 2 is being ported to the PSP.

430
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,220
And they're actually doing some pretty interesting stuff

431
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:36,720
with it.

432
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,000
Obviously, the PSP's got limited controls.

433
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,840
So how are you going to support everything that was in the PSP?

434
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:50,720
Well, basically what they're doing with Quake 2 this time is they're not only creating a

435
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:58,720
control scheme that uses the actual buttons and stuff on the PSP, but they're adding the

436
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,680
remote for the headset, which is kind of neat.

437
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:06,400
So you know that little headset player that no one ever uses for the PSP that plugs into

438
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,020
the headphone slot, as well as that little serial port that's on there.

439
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:14,180
They're actually using the buttons on that for different things.

440
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:23,980
So for example like in actual gameplay they have, let's see here, you use that to show

441
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:27,680
your inventory or show your mission stuff plus you can take a screenshot with one of

442
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:34,580
the buttons using that remote thing and then they have the movement using the normal control

443
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:38,540
buttons on there and then your items are your directional pad and of course the looking

444
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,300
is with the analog.

445
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:45,460
a little weird. It's a little weird, but it's pretty innovative. Creative. Creative, yeah.

446
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:52,220
So that's pretty neat and this is actually being put out by Team Emergency Exit and they

447
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:58,180
have a whole site here talking about what they're doing with the Quake 2 project. It's

448
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:08,180
being developed slowly. If you want to find out more about it, check out teamemergencyexit.blogspot.com.

449
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,380
Very cool.

450
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:13,260
Speaking of controllers and innovative things, of course Nintendo's Revolution Controller

451
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,660
always got a lot of buzz.

452
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,780
A little bit of a follow-up here.

453
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:23,520
Eurogamer actually posted a little bit earlier is that the story that a lot of places were

454
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,520
running including us last week about how Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess is going to be

455
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,820
supporting the Revolution Controller.

456
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:35,820
Well, Nintendo has actually quoted in a story on Eurogamer that the article in the January

457
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:40,500
edition of NGC magazine is speculation Nintendo has not made an official

458
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,980
announcement regarding this the game is still in development it will launch on

459
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:49,820
the GameCube in 2006 so they've essentially said screw you to that rumor

460
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:54,300
other follow-ups going on is that you remember we mentioned on a previous

461
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,940
podcast that PlayStation 3 is going to be getting unreal tournament it's

462
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:02,200
supposed to be a launch title well now it's kind of going back and forth a

463
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,760
little bit and essentially now it's it's gonna be a launch title it's not gonna

464
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,680
be a launch title, it's gonna be a launch title, it's not gonna be a launch title. Now they've said

465
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:13,600
Epic has come out and said it will be done when it's done and if it just so

466
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,400
happens that it's done when the PlayStation 3 is out great but we're not

467
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:22,480
pushing to be a launch title or whatever it's done when it's done. That's so much

468
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,240
agony in us to see. You've seen that movie yes? No. Is the one about

469
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:32,080
Michelangelo painting the Sistine Chapel? When will it be finished? When

470
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,360
and it's finished!

471
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,720
essentially that's what's going on with it

472
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,760
you know what's funny is I got a story actually that kind of involves the

473
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,160
whole Legend of Zelda and the revolution

474
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,120
kind of in a bit of irony there

475
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:46,940
oh really

476
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,640
this was actually in

477
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,800
Sir Owl Pose here, oh really, in the weirdest place ever in National

478
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,160
Geographic Kids Magazine they actually got to look at

479
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,160
the Nintendo Revolution controller

480
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:03,720
uh... that i don't get but anyway i have for the day there and we were told no

481
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,080
but anyways uh... it did

482
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,280
shed some light on how they're going to be using the revolution controller

483
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,600
probably for older games but anyways

484
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,680
uh... for example the legend of zelda

485
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,800
uh... one controller will be used to slash your sword in the other uh...

486
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,760
controller can actually be used as a shield

487
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:25,840
uh... the there's also fishing minigame which i'm assuming is in

488
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,240
uh...

489
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,240
you know Twilight Princess cuz I remember seeing that way I don't get I

490
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,840
thought but I just said it's all bullshit so what is

491
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,780
this hell if I know but this is what they're saying so I'm just going by

492
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,360
what's it

493
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,560
I'm you can actually use it to flick it I'm a flick it like a

494
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:47,360
fishing pole and you can use it in real life demo I don't know if it's a tech demo

495
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,560
I'm just telling you I'm just

496
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,560
might be a tech demo I know you're just reporting but I'm yelling at you just like our listeners are

497
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,680
Donkey Konga

498
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:57,720
use the two controllers like a drumsticks when you bring them down you'll

499
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,000
hear a drumbeat or cymbal crash other players can get into this by shaking the

500
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,680
controllers like maracas and tambourines

501
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:06,160
this is using the revolution controller with existing games then?

502
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,520
okay okay. Super Smash Brothers every time you hold

503
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:13,280
you punch while holding the controller on screen your character will do the

504
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,960
same the revolution remote controller also has a rumble feature so it will vibrate

505
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,840
whenever you hit

506
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,120
interesting I wonder what they're gonna do with some of the old school

507
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,160
games with this

508
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,660
Someone else brought up something very interesting, since it does use the old GameCube controllers

509
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:31,340
and it has the port on there, maybe you can use your old GameCube controllers for like

510
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:35,700
some of these games as well, instead of actually having to use the Revolution controller.

511
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,700
Hmm.

512
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,700
Maybe.

513
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,700
Who knows.

514
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,700
Interesting.

515
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:44,220
All right, well, let's see what people are commenting on stuff that we do, and the way

516
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,180
we do that is we open up our old mailbag.

517
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:50,320
It's togo at orangelandtrader.com is the place to go if you want to get it, is the place

518
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,320
to go.

519
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:56,080
to send us an email, togo at orangelaunchradio.com, but actually that email address may be changing

520
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,000
because we're actually dropping the To Go name from our show starting next week.

521
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,960
We're just going to be Orange Launch Radio.

522
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,540
However, that email address will still be good.

523
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,160
Don't worry, no messages will be lost.

524
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,320
It will simply forward to whatever the new address ends up being.

525
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,680
We'll let you know what that is next week.

526
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:16,360
So you can still continue to send your messages for now at togo at orangelaunchradio.com and

527
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:20,720
that's where Dark Soccer is going to open up the mailbag and peer in there and see what's

528
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:27,720
in there so what do we got this week? Oh god, I've got so much freaking email. Pick a couple

529
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:34,880
good ones and see what's up. Our buddy Lord Kausu on the board, also Takuland, has basically

530
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,480
pretty much corrected me on the game I was trying to think of for PC Engine, one of those

531
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:46,960
betas. It was Space Fantasy Zone, which is the one that I do not have, because it's only

532
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,240
a beta. I don't even remember, it's been a week. Our listeners are great at memory, but

533
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:56,080
I can't even remember this discussion. That's alright, alright. But that was the other Fantasy

534
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:01,960
Zone game I was trying to think of, TurboGrafx, that I don't have. Because it was only beta.

535
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:06,080
You know, I was- There's downloads available. I was playing Fantasy Zone 2 on GameTap this

536
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,880
week because I never realized that there was a Fantasy Zone 2. I had it on Master System.

537
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:14,480
Yeah, that's what it was on. And Fantasy Zone The Maze. I just want to point out it's the

538
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:22,400
damn thing as fans don't want yes to me okay just want to make that clear yep it sure is um also uh

539
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:31,680
we got um and i do apologize because i'm trying to go through the list um someone crispy creamy

540
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:38,080
emailed us uh saying i heard a rumor about the ps3 is it that the ps3 will have something in

541
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:43,040
each system so when you put a new disc into your system it marks the disc making that disc only

542
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:48,440
play on your own system is this just a rumor it has to be just a rumor that

543
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:54,440
would so lower on their marketability seriously and it would piss game fly off

544
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:59,960
essentially that would kill a company like that to do that to game I think

545
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:04,360
borrowing games from friends and all that stuff I think that adds to I

546
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,600
realized I want to combat piracy but that's I don't think that's the way to

547
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,680
do it that's not the way to combat piracy because you know then you can't

548
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,640
let your friends borrow games that's how I found out a lot about a lot of great

549
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:17,800
games especially back in the 8-bit NES day and still to some extent today so

550
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:22,000
that would not be a smart idea Sony if you're listening. One of our listeners

551
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,840
Matt wanted to point out make sure that we're not confusing Psychonauts for

552
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:31,960
PsyOps the mindgate conspiracy because Psychonauts was supposed to have had it

553
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:37,880
was a designed by Tim Schafer who had involvement just reading back from his

554
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:42,880
and Grim Fandango, Day of the Tentacle, Fourth Waddle, and the Monkey Island series.

555
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:47,880
Um, I mean, it basically is pointing out, you know, like we actually got several emails

556
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:52,880
about how awesome Psychonauts is, and so just wanted to, but I like this email

557
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,880
because it's pointing out, you know, maybe you guys are getting the game confused.

558
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,880
No, I, no, I know which game Psychonauts, I mean, that's a good thought,

559
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,880
but no, I know which game Psychonauts is, but, um, you know, that's, there,

560
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,880
there's gonna be fans of every game and we just have to agree to disagree sometimes.

561
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,020
sometimes this person has the single best name ever by the way my little

562
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:18,660
pony killer but his sign is Chupa thingy which I think is brilliant cuz for those

563
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:23,320
of us who love red versus blue Wow Wow Chupa thingy this this guy's pretty rad

564
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,720
what do you say was that the second not to email or was that no it's all

565
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,600
different okay hey guys love the podcast yay thank you I have some stuff to say

566
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,800
though first off on the latest podcast your red list of games that need a sequel

567
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,080
I think Starcraft should have a sequel that game was awesome

568
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:43,440
It was the game that got me into PC gaming but breed Wars has an expansion even though it got

569
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,340
Well, I think I just okay, even though it had enough game in it to have been released to Starcraft 2

570
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:55,800
next I think Ninja Gaiden should have a true sequel Ninja Gaiden black was not a true sequel and I want more and

571
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,720
that mentioning about bringing Ninja Gaiden 2 on Xbox live marketplace, but that's

572
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,320
that wasn't Tecmo did it?

573
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,960
Yeah Tecmo. I don't know why I was thinking of Sega for a moment, because Sega did Shinobi.

574
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,160
That's why I was going to get you. But Tecmo, they have to...

575
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:16,920
I don't see why they wouldn't do it, because... They're buddy-buddy with Microsoft now.

576
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,080
Do you remember on the

577
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,640
Super Nintendo they had the Ninja Gaiden trilogy on Super Nintendo?

578
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,200
It was like all three games on one cartridge?

579
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,360
It was kind of interesting because it was one of the first collections I remember that early on.

580
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:34,760
But they didn't change the games at all. It's just three games one cart. It's kind of neat. Yeah, I'd like to see a more I

581
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:40,800
Mean, I like Ninja Gaiden the new version and all but I'd like to see something a little truer to the roots sure

582
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,000
But do you remember the old old old Ninja Gaiden arcade game?

583
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,680
It really didn't play like that in Nintendo once to me. Anyway, it didn't play like the Nintendo ones to me at all

584
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,840
but there was

585
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:56,120
There was also a an interesting question on here. What's with this next generation pricing?

586
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:01,740
anyway. You pay ten bucks more for the new Madden 1, it just has slightly prettier graphics.

587
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:05,560
Their excuse is higher development costs to get these higher rent. It's just a big excuse.

588
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,640
I know, it's a big bunch of blah. Give it time, when the other two systems come out

589
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,640
there'll be competition. Nintendo will try to undercut them all. Well that's the whole

590
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,080
thing right now, is there are, it's like, okay, 360 games. Um, they're all coming out

591
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:22,920
at $60, pretty much, except for three of them. Um, what are you gonna do? Buy a different

592
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,080
game? Sorry, there's only two games coming out that month, so. Well, this looks like

593
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:29,960
last one struck a chord with me. He also said lastly, I think that the government should

594
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,280
either lay off the video game banning laws or burn the first amendment.

595
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,080
You know, there's been some more developments. I was keeping an eye on game politics this

596
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:42,100
week, and Utah's trying to get a law through now, and it's all the rage right now, so...

597
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,120
There's a few stories this week that...

598
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,840
Yeah, I kind of didn't bring them up tonight, because it's more of the same to me. It's

599
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,840
still, you know...

600
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,520
Well, there's one I point out too, Dark Sakura, and...

601
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,520
Sure.

602
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,520
But...

603
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,520
Yeah.

604
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,520
Okay.

605
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,920
and gaming. It just doesn't work. Alright. Any other emails, DarkSakura?

606
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,640
Well, yeah, I got quite a few. And I got a few from our buddy Rob, who I always love

607
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:13,640
hearing from. But I'm just going to go over them in a little bit of detail. There was

608
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:24,440
one about the PSP to TV converter on GearLive.com. Another one he sent me was a pretty long article.

609
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:28,040
I'm not going to go into too much detail but I would love for our listeners to read this

610
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,320
because it's a very good article.

611
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,360
Um, and I said he found it on a

612
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:36,860
Slashdot. Um, but there, it's talking about how

613
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:40,640
EB and Gamestop relies on used games to stay afloat and honestly I can,

614
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,280
that's all I hear about is getting those used game sales in and using that

615
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,360
discount card and

616
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,720
all that. Um, but the article is at

617
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:53,000
escapistmagazine.com slash issue slash 26

618
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:02,700
To sum it up, and I read through quite a bit of this article, it's that once more places

619
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:08,300
start doing more online content, as far as the old games go, there may not be as much

620
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:13,580
of a, let's purchase the used games, and so that's really going to take a lot of the steam,

621
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:17,100
a lot of the livelihood out of what keeps these companies alive.

622
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,100
Interesting.

623
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:22,080
It makes sense, because consider how GameStop started, it used to be Funkoland, which I

624
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:28,200
I remember in back in the 8-bit days they would advertise in magazines as a mail order

625
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,440
company for used games.

626
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,440
I don't know.

627
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:35,640
I think that actually, if anything, you would want more people to buy used games like, for

628
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,640
example, Halo.

629
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,720
Halo 2 right now, you can buy used, it's pretty cheap.

630
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:43,220
It's still one of the most widely played games out there and you can download different content

631
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,580
and maps and stuff for it.

632
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,580
So it sounds good to me.

633
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:49,040
For the record, I would like to point out that Gamestop and Funkoland were two different

634
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,040
places.

635
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:57,140
is a subsidy of the fully owned subsidy of Barnes and Noble. But didn't one buy

636
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:04,560
the other at some point? Yes. Okay. GameStop purchased Funco Land, Babbage's. Gotcha.

637
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:12,080
Okay. Software, etc. But they're all fully owned subsidy of Barnes and Noble,

638
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:18,480
which is why I get books cheap. Alright, anything else? Was that it? Or for now? For now.

639
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,580
All right to go what I'm coming to go at orange launch radio to come we welcome your emails

640
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:28,100
Let's go back over to Loki who has a story about the I River

641
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:34,680
Yes, I River hits the thorn in all of those wonderful portable mp3

642
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:41,640
Player sides this time. They're actually trying to get into the game market, which is quite interesting

643
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,420
with the brand new I River g10 it actually looks kind of like a

644
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:50,420
a, to be honest it looks like one of those things that Ben Heck would have made.

645
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:54,340
You know the guy did all those retro consoles in the portable systems.

646
00:40:54,340 --> 00:41:02,460
But anyways it has a nice 800x480, 260,000 color display as well as it's running off

647
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,820
of Windows CE 5.0 kind of like the Commodore portable.

648
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:13,100
It's also going to contain a 4 or 6 gigabyte storage on the actual system.

649
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:16,100
now they're kind of just showing it off as being able to play videos and stuff

650
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:20,380
like that and some Korean games not really too much on it right now some

651
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:24,700
people are saying oh this could be the PSP killer I say no you know it's

652
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:28,340
interesting though I mean do you know who everybody says should be getting

653
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,540
into game well not everybody but you know I keep seeing this on message

654
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:34,260
forums who they say should be getting into gaming and you know a lot of people

655
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:37,300
think that it's one of these things where they're just they're gonna come

656
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:40,340
out of nowhere when no one realizes it near you they're gonna fully back

657
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:43,180
somebody else or they're just gonna come out with their own things it's gonna

658
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:50,140
blow your effing mind you know who Apple Apple and you know you know I just look

659
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:53,540
at them don't they look like they're up to something don't they just have that

660
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:58,100
look on their face Apple yeah they'll make a game system that looks pretty and

661
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:03,140
people will buy it despite the fact that the specs suck well who knows is I don't

662
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:07,260
I don't know I just I get this feeling apples got to be up if Apple wanted to

663
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:10,440
enter the handheld market they could. If Apple wanted to team up with Nintendo

664
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:14,100
oh my god, I've said this on earlier podcasts, Apple, Nintendo, these two

665
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:18,660
companies excel at getting you to buy the same damn thing with cool new

666
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:23,140
features over and over again. Look at the iPod, iPod mini, iPod nano, iPod video and

667
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:27,820
look at the Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, Game Boy... these two companies got

668
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:33,140
together it'd be dangerous to your wallet. But just food for thought, all

669
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:39,620
All right, Xbox 360 is pissing off Gamefly a little bit because they are getting a lot

670
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:45,240
of scratched Xbox 360s back and they're actually having this form letter now that's going out

671
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:49,520
that says essentially you've been identified as somebody who sent back a scratched game

672
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,520
to us.

673
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:54,020
If in the future should Gamefly receive Xbox 360 games from you that have been damaged

674
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,540
you'll be charged replacement fees.

675
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:59,420
They're getting a little ticked off that a lot of their games are coming back scratched.

676
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:02,180
Should be noted that we haven't really seen this for the others.

677
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,640
all the systems are CD based, so it seems interesting that this one's making headlines

678
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,640
about the Xbox 360.

679
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:11,340
Because they're the only ones that have a really shoddy put together CD-ROM drive that

680
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:16,980
doesn't have the buffers in them to keep this level, and so when you tilt it, or bump it,

681
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:17,980
it scratches.

682
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:21,060
So don't move the Xbox 360 while you're playing your game.

683
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,060
Yeah.

684
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:27,180
Oh, side note though, and what I thought was quite interesting is the Xbox 360 knows whether

685
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:30,620
it's on its side or on its standing up.

686
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:34,660
It's got a level in there because there's a little light on the little ring of light

687
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,700
that shows what the controller's player won.

688
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:40,360
If it's on the ground, it will be still up in the upper left corner.

689
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:44,740
You tilt it up, it will move itself so that it's in the upper left corner.

690
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:45,740
Kind of weird.

691
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:46,740
But don't do that while the game is playing.

692
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:47,740
Well, definitely no.

693
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:48,740
Don't do that.

694
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:52,500
I just want to mention real quick, BloodRayne came out in theaters this week, you know,

695
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,660
Uwe Boll's latest epic.

696
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:57,780
I think it grossed about a million dollars, well out of the top ten this week.

697
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:00,780
Are any of us surprised?

698
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:05,700
He has the next three films financed already so we will be at

699
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:09,060
least seeing three more films. You know there's one of those stupid little internet

700
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,380
petitions going on

701
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:15,260
to hear Ewey Bowles talk. That's old, that's not seen before. It made me laugh.

702
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:19,180
It really made me laugh. It's getting a resurgence now because of this movie. By the way, I should

703
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:22,680
point out internetmoviedatabase.com, it's already showing up in their

704
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,060
bottom 100 movies of all time.

705
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:27,660
44 last time I checked. Alright.

706
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:35,180
Let's go over to DarkSakura who has another story about the 360, something about the UK

707
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:37,220
for our UK folks.

708
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:41,860
Actually yes, I do.

709
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:47,940
Basically European Xbox Live Marketplace has been keeping playable demos and supplies,

710
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:57,060
however they have found a way to get American and Japanese games, some of the demos.

711
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:00,960
Apparently the way to do that according to a gamerreport.com is all you have to do is

712
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,040
go to Microsoft password site and create a new Hotmail account and then say you're either

713
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,080
from Japan or the United States.

714
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,080
That's kind of smart.

715
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:12,960
Make a note of the phone number that you supply and once you've activated it turn on your

716
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,640
Xbox 360, press the guide button and select switch profile.

717
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,160
Interesting, good way to get around that.

718
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,160
Smart thinking guys.

719
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:27,160
My source hasn't tried it out yet, but I would love to listen to any of our UK listeners

720
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,160
that has an Xbox 360.

721
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,440
Give it a try, let me know what you find.

722
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:37,340
Now it does, I have seen, this is actually also on Xbox360.qj.net, previously known as

723
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:39,640
Xbox 360 updates.

724
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,920
They have tried it and it does work.

725
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:48,200
So what you can gain though from, like for example the Fight Night Round 3 demo that

726
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:54,280
that came out, it was not available to the UK, so you can actually check that out now.

727
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:59,460
And also Ridge Racer 6, would be another, well actually Ridge Racer 6 doesn't have a

728
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:00,460
demo, never mind.

729
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:04,380
But there is some other stuff, so basically, I'm kind of looking forward to the Japanese

730
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:09,800
ones because they're going to be getting some cool demos online over there eventually, so

731
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,380
that'd be cool.

732
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:12,380
Very cool.

733
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:15,700
And we've got to use that technique, hurry up before they close the loophole.

734
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:17,740
Nah, they're not going to close the loophole.

735
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:18,740
We'll see.

736
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:23,180
All right, you have a story about virtual reality in the revolution, Logie?

737
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:26,500
Yeah, and the continuing saga of...

738
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:30,260
The continued speculation about 3D on the revolution.

739
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:31,260
Exactly.

740
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:38,180
At CES this year, they were showing off a 3D visor called the Z800 3D visor.

741
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:42,580
It was actually put out by a third-party company.

742
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:49,840
Nintendo has actually purchased a numerous amount of these systems to actually be using

743
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:54,780
it with the revolution or possibly using something like that with the revolution.

744
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:56,000
Just basically checking it out.

745
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,520
It is available though for all three systems, so everybody is kind of taking a look at it

746
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:04,320
but still kind of backs up the whole thing, you know, virtual reality type stuff.

747
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,840
Probably checking out to see what their competition is doing, you know.

748
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:12,320
I'm still saying, E3 this year, come find out you're going to see something different

749
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:15,780
and there's another thing that they've actually registered the nintendo i was

750
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:20,360
that i've wasn't like floor revision i heard about that uh...

751
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,780
whatever that is that's

752
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:24,880
low interesting interesting issues you were

753
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,080
all right on

754
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,780
from dark soccer you have a story about something

755
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:32,200
that uh... something to keep in mind a tax season what's up with this

756
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,320
uh...

757
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:37,880
i just love the first line of this it's official the iris has its eyes on your

758
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,720
virtual gold

759
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,340
Oh, I did hear about that.

760
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:42,740
Okay, what's up with this?

761
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:46,340
Well, it's basically saying that they're just kind

762
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:48,640
to keeping an eye on this as a potential,

763
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:53,600
but the last issue of Legal Affairs magazine,

764
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:58,060
IRS Advisors, specializing in barter income,

765
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:00,420
recently offered the opinion that any trade

766
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,740
of one virtual item for another,

767
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:04,560
gold pieces for thick leather,

768
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,540
Uber drops for platinum,

769
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:11,340
could uh... constitute taxable income gathering exchange a credit to the i r s

770
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:12,580
israel's imparter

771
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:16,860
but how can you force out with a worldwide game

772
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,060
met

773
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,860
without real items

774
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:24,100
i know what what's the government going to do with ten gold pieces and wow i

775
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:27,840
mean seriously but this is the same song as it has as each good has a

776
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:31,100
determinable fair market value

777
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,720
they're not gonna be you're not gonna be paying them in gold pieces room pay them

778
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,460
in real money that's yet

779
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:38,240
you're not actually changing real money in the game how would they force and

780
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,760
force out of the european player

781
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,920
well that's basically the problem um...

782
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,680
they have to

783
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:48,420
right now they're working on consistency for it um...

784
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:52,320
a lot of people have objected to this i mean just really objected to this

785
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,620
well duh it has to do with money

786
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:57,860
my thing is though is i'm gonna take

787
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:00,860
significant losses in these games because if

788
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:01,840
they can take it

789
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,880
i can take it that's right i could write it off my taxes right

790
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,920
if I start a business in a while and lose money.

791
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,380
Imagine just one of the pain in the ass that would be...

792
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:11,180
The goblins took my money!

793
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:17,380
For there to be issued 1099s on every single player.

794
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:21,880
And we're talking people who aren't even old enough to be taxed.

795
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:22,780
Yeah.

796
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:28,880
You can't own real land, but hey, we can tax you for getting that, you know, helmet.

797
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,680
Something tells me this ain't gonna fly.

798
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:31,720
It's not gonna.

799
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:32,980
Weird idea.

800
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:34,980
And if it does, I'm freakin' moving.

801
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:36,980
Why are people in the IRS actually...

802
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:38,980
Why are they actually looking at this?

803
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:40,980
I mean, don't they have better things to do?

804
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:42,980
Cause our government is po!

805
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,980
Alright, uh...

806
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:48,980
Fantasy Star Universe is a game some of us here have our eye on.

807
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:52,980
It was supposed to be coming out for PS2 and PC in Japan on February 16th,

808
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:54,980
but it's been pushed back.

809
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:58,980
March 30th now is the new date that Fantasy Star Universe will be coming out.

810
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:01,980
Quality improvement is the reason.

811
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:06,880
This is unknown yet, what it'll do to the US and European release dates because they

812
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:07,880
weren't unscheduled.

813
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:12,660
So, spring, summer, who knows, but Phantasy Star Universe is at least making its debut

814
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:15,580
sometime in 2006, should be interesting.

815
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:19,920
Loki's got one more story for us tonight regarding Mario Mix.

816
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:28,740
Mario Mix, it's official from Nintendo, they won't sell anymore, it's done.

817
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:31,820
now whether it's coming back at some point who knows but

818
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:35,620
you're not going to be able to find it because stores can't do reorders on it

819
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:38,780
they're not making anymore as far as it's concerned right now

820
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:42,500
so if you own it lucky you it's a collectors item yeah it's

821
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:46,020
should have bought it when I had the chance it's going a lot right now the other game

822
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:46,740
that's also

823
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:50,100
kinda sold out right now Magna Carta huh for the PS

824
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:53,780
it's apparently so popular that they haven't been able to

825
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:57,060
reprint them fast enough so oddly enough I wouldn't have guessed that

826
00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:00,300
Alright, PlayStation 2

827
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:04,700
they're gonna be getting in a special Final Fantasy 12

828
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:08,360
PlayStation 2 system. It's going to be a Final Fantasy 12 PlayStation 2

829
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,860
coming out March 16th, oh but

830
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:15,140
that'll be in Japan. And it's going to be going out for an

831
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:19,060
open price. What the heck does this mean? This means that there's no set

832
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:22,500
manufacturer suggested retail. The stores can just

833
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,820
sell it at whatever price they want to set. Of course

834
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:29,020
Sony and Square Enix sets a price to the retailers so I don't know this whole

835
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:30,540
thing doesn't really make sense to me but

836
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:33,620
the retailers can choose their own profit levels which I think is very

837
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:37,740
interesting. I'm gonna take a wild guess here in sense there is no profit in

838
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:40,300
systems as we had a conversation earlier this week about

839
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:44,020
systems are sold for about five dollars more than what the retailer pays

840
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:48,060
for them. So my guess is gonna be maybe

841
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:52,420
around what they're paying for them. And you also get with this a

842
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:53,700
PlayStation 2 stand

843
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,540
and a Final Fantasy 12 phone strap.

844
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:01,180
All right, one more story for us tonight

845
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:02,900
and Dark Soccer is bringing it to us.

846
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:05,220
It has to do with a new game coming out

847
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,540
featuring some classic, classic characters.

848
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:08,380
It's kind of a follow-up.

849
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:09,900
I remember talking about these guys before,

850
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,460
so what's happening?

851
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:13,180
It's just a little tiny something.

852
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:17,220
Namco, I love Namco, has basically confirmed

853
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:19,280
for us Snoopy versus the Red Baron.

854
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:22,520
And it's where Snoopy has a magical dream

855
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:29,480
becomes a world war one flying ace who must pilot a biplane to stop the red

856
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:33,920
baron crimson skies featuring Snoopy is great I just think that's gonna be cool

857
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:39,560
I'm hoping that they have the unlockable Snoopy's doghouse as the plane I'm

858
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:43,720
hoping they have the unlockable minigame where Charlie Brown tries to kick that

859
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:48,760
football from that fucking bitch that never lets him do it Lucy yeah Lucy yes

860
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:53,480
And you can finally kick the damn ball and that steer past the kite eating tree

861
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,340
Linus searches for his blanket

862
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:06,000
Final thoughts time my final thought is good grief Loki your final thought my final thought is

863
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:12,080
I've got a play some more 360 stuff dark soccer your final thought reject false icons

864
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:16,480
