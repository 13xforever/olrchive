00:00:00,189 --> 00:00:02,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of January 9th, 2006.

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:13,215
[SPEAKER_00]: You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

3
00:00:13,475 --> 00:00:16,997
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

4
00:00:18,157 --> 00:00:21,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everybody once again, and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:21,979 --> 00:00:25,621
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that podcast dedicated to what gamers really want to know about.

6
00:00:25,701 --> 00:00:28,622
[SPEAKER_02]: We here at Orange Lounge like to talk about games that don't suck...

7
00:00:29,417 --> 00:00:33,160
[SPEAKER_02]: But sometimes, you know, we'll tell you about a couple that do suck just to tell you to stay the hell away.

8
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,561
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts.

9
00:00:34,581 --> 00:00:35,562
[SPEAKER_02]: You might know me as Sky.

10
00:00:35,582 --> 00:00:37,143
[SPEAKER_02]: My awesome co-hosts are here.

11
00:00:37,463 --> 00:00:39,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

12
00:00:39,605 --> 00:00:40,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

13
00:00:40,325 --> 00:00:41,026
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing?

14
00:00:42,106 --> 00:00:42,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

15
00:00:42,827 --> 00:00:43,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?

16
00:00:43,848 --> 00:00:44,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

17
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:45,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, good.

18
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, before when we were taping our live show earlier this evening, you were a little sickly, but you're feeling better now.

19
00:00:49,672 --> 00:00:51,473
[SPEAKER_04]: It was that horrible Chinese food.

20
00:00:51,493 --> 00:00:53,835
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that my body can process that type of stuff anymore.

21
00:00:54,075 --> 00:00:58,899
[SPEAKER_02]: We went to this horrible Chinese buffet for dinner tonight, and it was cheap, but the food, you know, it's just...

22
00:00:59,754 --> 00:01:02,857
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the grossest of the gross Chinese food, but, you know, oh well.

23
00:01:03,617 --> 00:01:04,558
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't even that filling.

24
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:06,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, Loki.

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Suddenly we're the Food Network.

26
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki is over there in that corner, the other co-host.

27
00:01:10,642 --> 00:01:11,003
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing?

28
00:01:11,843 --> 00:01:21,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully good because that, speaking of the Chinese food place, the beef that was for the Mongolian barbecue type stuff wasn't frozen.

29
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,572
[SPEAKER_01]: It was quite raw and sitting there out in the open.

30
00:01:23,612 --> 00:01:27,294
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems like a health code violation to me, but okay.

31
00:01:27,315 --> 00:01:27,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

32
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,437
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I'm dead tomorrow, then we'll know why.

33
00:01:53,087 --> 00:01:57,552
[SPEAKER_02]: And since it's going to be two hours in length, that means you guys are going to get two podcasts throughout the week.

34
00:01:57,912 --> 00:02:00,515
[SPEAKER_02]: So Twice the Orange Lounge Radio coming to the podcast stream.

35
00:02:00,755 --> 00:02:02,016
[SPEAKER_02]: That all starts next week.

36
00:02:02,477 --> 00:02:04,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Next week's show as well, Freeze Pop.

37
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:05,640
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have them on the show.

38
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,821
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be awesome.

39
00:02:06,881 --> 00:02:07,822
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a great interview.

40
00:02:07,842 --> 00:02:10,945
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really excited to have Freeze Pop, a very well-known band.

41
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:14,328
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys have played Guitar Hero, Amplitude Frequency, it's going to be awesome.

42
00:02:14,749 --> 00:02:16,711
[SPEAKER_02]: We have one of them coming on, so it's going to be great.

43
00:02:17,295 --> 00:02:19,417
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, What's Going On In Your Gaming Week?

44
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,080
[SPEAKER_02]: To enrich your mind once in a while.

45
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,741
[SPEAKER_02]: You ever play text adventure games?

46
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:46,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Zork?

47
00:02:46,562 --> 00:02:46,962
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember those?

48
00:02:47,182 --> 00:02:48,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I used to play Gemstone 3.

49
00:02:48,383 --> 00:02:49,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

50
00:02:49,804 --> 00:02:50,545
[SPEAKER_02]: I never played that one.

51
00:02:50,605 --> 00:02:52,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Back when I was a geek on AOL.

52
00:02:52,426 --> 00:02:54,368
[SPEAKER_02]: What about like the middle range?

53
00:02:54,388 --> 00:02:59,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when text games kind of evolved into graphical games and what adventure games are today?

54
00:02:59,071 --> 00:03:00,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Like King's Quest, Space Quest?

55
00:03:00,212 --> 00:03:03,335
[SPEAKER_04]: I played King's Quest 4 a little bit, but I just couldn't get into that.

56
00:03:03,955 --> 00:03:04,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God.

57
00:03:04,336 --> 00:03:05,797
[SPEAKER_02]: King's Quest 4 was my favorite.

58
00:03:07,118 --> 00:03:11,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I played Loom, but Loom was more sort of a combination.

59
00:03:11,481 --> 00:03:14,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there wasn't so much text at that point, but yeah, that's cool.

60
00:03:15,683 --> 00:03:17,284
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Loki, how was your gaming week?

61
00:03:17,685 --> 00:03:19,025
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty good.

62
00:03:19,086 --> 00:03:20,827
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been trying to play a lot more on the 360.

63
00:03:22,107 --> 00:03:33,174
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I've been playing my normal games, Animal Crossing DS every day, and then I've been playing, what else, Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, which I'm very excited to hear that they're

64
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming out with a PS2 version of that game.

65
00:03:36,034 --> 00:03:39,715
[SPEAKER_01]: And a new PSP version of Grand Theft Auto at some point this year.

66
00:03:41,056 --> 00:03:43,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, of course, I got to try a few things on the 360.

67
00:03:43,917 --> 00:03:47,038
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, I've been playing Call of Duty 2, the single player mode in that.

68
00:03:47,578 --> 00:03:48,498
[SPEAKER_01]: And that game's amazing.

69
00:03:48,578 --> 00:03:49,818
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just really awesome.

70
00:03:50,879 --> 00:04:00,162
[SPEAKER_01]: It does though, I'm playing on the easiest difficulty because I'm not very good at these military first person shooters that involve actual realistic damage to your character and stuff like that.

71
00:04:00,766 --> 00:04:01,066
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.

72
00:04:25,885 --> 00:04:26,446
[SPEAKER_01]: Fight Night Round 3

73
00:04:42,304 --> 00:04:43,425
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

74
00:05:04,601 --> 00:05:08,162
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, I did play a little bit of online multiplayer for Call of Duty 2.

75
00:05:09,022 --> 00:05:13,803
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay, but do not bring up the guide when you're playing the game online.

76
00:05:13,823 --> 00:05:17,744
[SPEAKER_01]: I accidentally hit the button trying to hit pause to change my weapon on it.

77
00:05:18,564 --> 00:05:21,885
[SPEAKER_01]: And my game started glitching out like crazy after that.

78
00:05:22,045 --> 00:05:23,865
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something they gotta fix.

79
00:05:24,805 --> 00:05:27,946
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing was the server was full this morning so I couldn't play online.

80
00:05:28,306 --> 00:05:29,086
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of sucked.

81
00:05:29,906 --> 00:05:33,207
[SPEAKER_01]: And I haven't figured out a way to get my friends to play the same game with me.

82
00:05:33,227 --> 00:05:33,447
[SPEAKER_01]: And that

83
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:34,750
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, it's frustrating.

84
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,711
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of frustrating stuff with Xbox Live.

85
00:05:38,153 --> 00:05:39,914
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, on the regular Xbox, it's just fine.

86
00:05:39,954 --> 00:05:42,496
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what your problems are, but it's all new.

87
00:05:42,957 --> 00:05:43,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

88
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, also, you're kind of a new Xbox user, so maybe there's stuff you're missing.

89
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:46,940
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

90
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,941
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the hell I'm doing.

91
00:05:47,961 --> 00:06:02,633
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times, I've got my... The only other person I have that's actually playing with me is one of my customers, because I do game sales at work, and one of my customers got 360, so I've been talking with him, voice chatting stuff, which doesn't work well, because they use headphones at the same time, too, so...

92
00:06:03,109 --> 00:06:04,050
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

93
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:31,528
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, my gaming week, I didn't play a whole lot of new stuff.

94
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:37,029
[SPEAKER_02]: I went out and I got Amplitude for $10 because I had borrowed that game from another friend of mine for like a year.

95
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:41,130
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, I just had to buy my own dang copy, which is great.

96
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:42,751
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a great game.

97
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:44,991
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the most underrated PS2 games of all time.

98
00:06:45,191 --> 00:06:48,832
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another reason why I'm excited Freeze Pop's going to be here next week because they contributed to that game.

99
00:06:50,192 --> 00:06:53,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I picked out a copy of Burnout.

100
00:06:53,693 --> 00:06:55,514
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

101
00:07:18,885 --> 00:07:20,187
[SPEAKER_02]: and why did I call it Xbox 1.5?

102
00:07:20,447 --> 00:07:21,408
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea.

103
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:26,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, because I have the Halo thing, so sometimes I joke that it's not really the first Xbox.

104
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:27,014
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the 1.5.

105
00:07:27,555 --> 00:07:28,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, that's what some people call the 360.

106
00:07:29,017 --> 00:07:31,860
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fun game.

107
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,280
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.

108
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,762
[SPEAKER_02]: I like making car wrecks.

109
00:07:33,942 --> 00:07:37,006
[SPEAKER_02]: I have actually been having trouble with Xbox Live on that game as well, though.

110
00:07:37,446 --> 00:07:38,367
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of interesting.

111
00:07:38,707 --> 00:07:41,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, I know I'd get my ass kicked if I tried to play a lot online, so I don't really.

112
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,652
[SPEAKER_02]: I need an actual steering wheel to really get the feel for that game.

113
00:07:45,852 --> 00:07:47,434
[SPEAKER_02]: The controller is not the same to me.

114
00:07:47,494 --> 00:07:49,095
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't drive with a controller on that game.

115
00:07:50,154 --> 00:08:17,854
[SPEAKER_02]: but otherwise it's been the same old stuff not a whole lot of new stuff I've been playing a lot of Animal Crossing and Partners in Time which I talked about a couple weeks ago on the show Mario and Luigi for DS well what's ironic is I'll be quitting Final Fantasy XI at some point here I haven't really set a date yet when I'm going to cancel my account but I'm also going to be participating in the beta for Final Fantasy XI on the 360 that's why I want to get my Xbox 360 I want in on that beta

116
00:08:20,276 --> 00:08:21,277
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

117
00:08:21,317 --> 00:08:22,377
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be pretty in HD.

118
00:08:22,397 --> 00:08:23,718
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be so pretty.

119
00:08:23,978 --> 00:08:24,758
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll bring it over.

120
00:08:25,358 --> 00:08:26,239
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not good enough.

121
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:26,899
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to play.

122
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:28,160
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to start from the beginning.

123
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,600
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad I quit that game.

124
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,181
[SPEAKER_02]: You can kiss my booty.

125
00:08:31,961 --> 00:08:32,462
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay.

126
00:08:32,482 --> 00:08:33,082
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know where it's been.

127
00:08:34,304 --> 00:08:34,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

128
00:08:35,406 --> 00:08:37,568
[SPEAKER_02]: So, well, that kind of leads us into a news item here.

129
00:08:37,608 --> 00:08:40,311
[SPEAKER_02]: We got the Final Fantasy XI demo is coming to the U.S.

130
00:08:40,331 --> 00:08:41,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't you sign up for it now?

131
00:08:41,773 --> 00:08:47,139
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they have the sign-ups for it right now to get your content ID numbers, basically, you know, the registration codes that you need.

132
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,080
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they going to close it?

133
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,782
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I go and sign up even though I don't have an account?

134
00:08:49,822 --> 00:08:50,964
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably should.

135
00:08:51,124 --> 00:08:51,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I will.

136
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,107
[SPEAKER_01]: So go sign up right now if you haven't yet.

137
00:08:54,929 --> 00:08:57,991
[SPEAKER_01]: The demo CD, I'm not sure the other ways to get it.

138
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:02,113
[SPEAKER_01]: I do know that it's going to be in the official Xbox Magazine, the February issue.

139
00:09:02,634 --> 00:09:07,717
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to have that, but I think there's other ways to get it if you're not subscribed or don't want to buy it.

140
00:09:07,877 --> 00:09:09,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Have they talked about the limitations of the beta?

141
00:09:09,518 --> 00:09:11,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Because obviously it can't be the full game.

142
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,501
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the full game, just not the new patch.

143
00:09:15,123 --> 00:09:16,344
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

144
00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:37,490
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

145
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:55,860
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura

00:10:12,861 --> 00:10:13,502

00:10:33,798 --> 00:10:44,666
[SPEAKER_04]: owns Bondi Namco Group US subsidiaries including Bondi America, Bondi Entertainment, Namco America Inc., Namco Cybertape Inc.

149
00:10:44,706 --> 00:10:49,130
[SPEAKER_04]: being the arcades, and Namco Networks America Inc.

150
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:53,293
[SPEAKER_04]: that's the mobile game unit, and Namco Bondi Games America for the video games.

151
00:10:53,493 --> 00:10:54,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

152
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,241
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess so.

153
00:11:05,461 --> 00:11:06,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Be interesting.

154
00:11:07,023 --> 00:11:10,827
[SPEAKER_02]: One day they're all going to be bought by one of the folks, or they'll put out their own consoles.

155
00:11:11,668 --> 00:11:11,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

156
00:11:12,128 --> 00:11:12,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

157
00:11:13,109 --> 00:11:13,389
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

158
00:11:14,731 --> 00:11:17,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, you have some news from the Consumer Electronics Show, right?

159
00:11:17,694 --> 00:11:18,535
[SPEAKER_02]: What was going on now?

160
00:11:18,615 --> 00:11:20,217
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard about some new attachment for the 360.

161
00:11:20,257 --> 00:11:21,518
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be pretty big.

162
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:22,719
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a lot of stuff going on.

163
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,681
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, they're showing off the new...

164
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:28,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Video Technologies, both HD DVD and Blu-ray.

165
00:11:29,317 --> 00:11:37,282
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, you know, Sony being behind Blu-ray, then that means, you know, the Microsoft has the back, or the HD DVD.

166
00:11:37,983 --> 00:11:45,328
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're actually going to be selling an add-on unit for the Xbox 360 for HD DVD.

167
00:11:45,368 --> 00:11:46,849
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be HD DVD Drive.

168
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:52,173
[SPEAKER_01]: The only catch is, it's only for HD DVD movies, not games.

169
00:11:52,513 --> 00:11:54,615
[SPEAKER_01]: So unless you're thinking, oh, hey, you know,

170
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:57,708
[SPEAKER_01]: More storage space for these upcoming games.

171
00:11:57,728 --> 00:11:59,648
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, again, that's not going to happen.

172
00:11:59,768 --> 00:12:05,810
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's that same issue that Xbox 360s didn't come default packed in with the hard drive.

173
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,911
[SPEAKER_02]: So now not every game can support the hard drive because not everybody has one.

174
00:12:09,431 --> 00:12:10,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing with the HD DVD.

175
00:12:10,411 --> 00:12:11,692
[SPEAKER_01]: I still think, though, that they can.

176
00:12:11,952 --> 00:12:15,353
[SPEAKER_01]: They just make it so that you have to have the hard drive when you buy it.

177
00:12:15,373 --> 00:12:15,873
[SPEAKER_02]: It's risky.

178
00:12:15,973 --> 00:12:18,074
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Final Fantasy XI is going to have to do it, but it's still risky.

179
00:12:18,454 --> 00:12:18,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

180
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:20,607
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

181
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:22,749
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things that they've got so far.

182
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:27,031
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's stupid because if I'm going to get an HD DVD player, I'll just get a standalone player.

183
00:12:27,091 --> 00:12:29,793
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do I need an add-on for the 360?

184
00:12:30,814 --> 00:12:32,755
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is probably going to be overpriced, like the hard drive.

185
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:34,112
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

186
00:13:00,816 --> 00:13:01,876
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

187
00:13:24,426 --> 00:13:27,949
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so what about some of the games that were over at Consumer Electronics Show, Logan?

188
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:36,796
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that they were showing off, actually, in the Dolby Digital booth was Burnout Revenge for the 360, and wow, does it look sexy.

189
00:13:37,556 --> 00:13:39,218
[SPEAKER_01]: So they actually had a few screenshots.

190
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:40,198
[SPEAKER_01]: It was playable, though.

191
00:13:40,739 --> 00:13:43,481
[SPEAKER_01]: They said that they've added... It's basically built from the ground up.

192
00:13:44,061 --> 00:13:50,947
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got more detailed models to actually show damage to the cars and stuff, as well as they've added 10 crash junctions...

193
00:13:51,451 --> 00:13:59,695
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically going to be just a really nice, pretty-looking version of Burnout Revenge, hopefully with some better single-player mode stuff in there, like Burnout 3.

194
00:13:59,835 --> 00:14:03,857
[SPEAKER_01]: But, yeah, basically expect it to be really awesome.

195
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:05,358
[SPEAKER_01]: It is going to be coming out in March.

196
00:14:06,558 --> 00:14:06,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

197
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:11,160
[SPEAKER_02]: One other thing I know they announced at the Consumer Electronics Show, some expansions coming to Xbox Arcade?

198
00:14:11,741 --> 00:14:12,541
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.

199
00:14:13,321 --> 00:14:16,523
[SPEAKER_01]: With Xbox Live, the arcade is just awesome to begin with.

200
00:14:16,903 --> 00:14:21,205
[SPEAKER_01]: And this, of course, being one of the hugest games in the arcade scene, Street Fighter...

201
00:14:22,343 --> 00:14:25,504
[SPEAKER_01]: is coming to the arcade, and they're doing some pretty cool stuff with it.

202
00:14:27,025 --> 00:14:33,727
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, for example, they've got this kind of coin-up mode, which is... I heard about this, the quarter mode, it's called.

203
00:14:33,827 --> 00:14:34,528
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard about this.

204
00:14:34,568 --> 00:14:35,388
[SPEAKER_01]: This is pretty crazy.

205
00:14:35,628 --> 00:14:41,610
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, and it's kind of basically this new thing created for Xbox Live Arcade.

206
00:14:42,251 --> 00:14:51,334
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually do a spectator-based system where you get to watch people play and stuff like that, and you can buy into player matches and stuff.

207
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:58,565
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got... Basically, the quarters are used to represent players and pays homage to the arcade type thing.

208
00:14:58,626 --> 00:15:02,731
[SPEAKER_01]: Voice chat, which is kind of cool because it'll bring back the trash talking from the arcade.

209
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:04,293
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, just what we need on Xbox Live.

210
00:15:04,353 --> 00:15:05,514
[SPEAKER_01]: More trash talking.

211
00:15:05,574 --> 00:15:05,995
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

212
00:15:06,355 --> 00:15:07,797
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they also have...

213
00:15:09,404 --> 00:15:12,045
[SPEAKER_01]: Gaming Lobby to watch the brawls and stuff like that.

214
00:15:12,365 --> 00:15:15,905
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do an opti-match, which is good player matching stuff.

215
00:15:15,965 --> 00:15:22,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Training mode, of course, CPU battles, arcade mode, which is kind of like the arcade type thing.

216
00:15:22,807 --> 00:15:30,948
[SPEAKER_01]: They have best characters, rankings on which characters are the most popular, monthly rankings, and just a whole new thing.

217
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,028
[SPEAKER_01]: For a game that's over 10 years old.

218
00:15:33,248 --> 00:15:36,109
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, and 5.1 surround sound, which is

219
00:15:36,755 --> 00:15:37,415
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess kind of neat.

220
00:15:37,435 --> 00:15:40,316
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what they'd be doing with it, but I don't know.

221
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:44,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Personally, I think this is one of the best things coming to the Xbox Live Arcade.

222
00:15:45,138 --> 00:15:47,298
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a huge fighting fan, but it's awesome.

223
00:15:47,518 --> 00:15:49,939
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is Smash TV was great to begin with.

224
00:15:49,979 --> 00:15:50,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, exactly.

225
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,242
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm hoping that more of this stuff comes to the arcade, and they're talking about maybe one of the rumors was Ninja Turtles arcade games.

226
00:15:57,302 --> 00:15:59,882
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get some actual meme stuff on here.

227
00:15:59,902 --> 00:16:01,063
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be fucking awesome.

228
00:16:01,843 --> 00:16:04,504
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I would personally be happiest if we got Turtles in Time.

229
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:15,569
[SPEAKER_02]: either of the Turtles games or I'm thinking the X-Men game remember that X-Men thing was huge it was like six players I was all over that machine with two screens

230
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:17,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah, that was an awesome game.

231
00:16:17,956 --> 00:16:18,596
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be fun to have.

232
00:16:18,837 --> 00:16:19,817
[SPEAKER_02]: See, you could do that on HDTV.

233
00:16:19,837 --> 00:16:20,797
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be fun.

234
00:16:21,217 --> 00:16:21,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

235
00:16:22,677 --> 00:16:28,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's something else coming out of Consumer Electronics Show, and I love this because I grew up on the Commodore 64.

236
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, get this.

237
00:16:30,939 --> 00:16:37,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Commodore International Corporation now owns this brand, and they're going to be releasing something called the Commodore Combo.

238
00:16:38,221 --> 00:16:44,602
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to have five games included and another 90 approximately available for download online.

239
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:48,483
[SPEAKER_02]: A 20 gigabyte hard drive running Windows CE.

240
00:16:48,983 --> 00:16:56,765
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Commodore's coming back in this like handheld thing and I'm assuming that maybe some of the great Commodore 64 classics will be coming to this system.

241
00:16:57,125 --> 00:17:03,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not great Giana Sisters, but maybe we would have some of the other great Commodore 64 games.

242
00:17:03,947 --> 00:17:05,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man, the Commodore 64 was such an awesome system.

243
00:17:06,127 --> 00:17:10,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, a lot of games that were on Atari 2600 were on the Commodore 64 as well, but better.

244
00:17:10,471 --> 00:17:13,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, H-E-R-O, I think of off the top of my head.

245
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:19,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, oh man, I just, I grew up, like, that was my gaming system when I grew up was Commodore 64, so I'm excited about this.

246
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:20,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.

247
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:21,820
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see Jumpman Jr.

248
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,841
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to take that on handheld.

249
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:23,702
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Jumpman.

250
00:17:23,722 --> 00:17:24,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

251
00:17:24,562 --> 00:17:25,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Jumpman, Jumpman Jr., whatever.

252
00:17:25,803 --> 00:17:29,186
[SPEAKER_02]: How about, I want my Impossible Mission on the go, so I can get that.

253
00:17:31,128 --> 00:17:31,168
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh...

254
00:17:33,047 --> 00:17:34,468
[SPEAKER_01]: This would have to do with...

255
00:17:59,358 --> 00:18:03,641
[SPEAKER_04]: A game called Odama coming out for the GameCube.

256
00:18:04,241 --> 00:18:08,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, it's a nod to Yu Saito who bought us Seaman.

257
00:18:10,324 --> 00:18:12,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Who remembers talking to your fish on the Dreamcast?

258
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:14,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Marmar.

259
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:16,495
[SPEAKER_02]: I never played that game.

260
00:18:16,515 --> 00:18:17,376
[SPEAKER_04]: I played Seaman.

261
00:18:17,556 --> 00:18:21,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, actually, more specifically, Dan played Seaman and I would ask him foul questions.

262
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,241
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I thought Seaman was coming back.

263
00:18:23,581 --> 00:18:26,344
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that they were going to remake that or something.

264
00:18:26,364 --> 00:18:28,406
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Jamie, are you saying you enjoy playing with Seaman?

265
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,047
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to hate you.

266
00:18:30,728 --> 00:18:31,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

267
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:40,096
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically, you know, Nintendo was really slow to sort of take on to the idea that

268
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:51,014
[SPEAKER_04]: But the premise behind it is that it's a military pinball game set in feudal Japan, where you knock down barriers, run over enemies, use a microphone to issue vocal commands.

269
00:18:52,255 --> 00:18:54,118
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems kind of odd to me.

270
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,401
[SPEAKER_04]: I would rather have another Seaman, but, you know...

271
00:18:57,341 --> 00:19:02,546
[SPEAKER_02]: I also think that there's a neat little mention here that Miyamoto's favorite game of all time is Pac-Man.

272
00:19:02,586 --> 00:19:02,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

273
00:19:02,706 --> 00:19:03,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

274
00:19:23,503 --> 00:19:37,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of the DS, well, that's not really a DS, but speaking of Nintendo and something that's going to be happening with the DS, Contact is a new game currently in development, and it is actually being produced by the same director who produced Capcom's Killer7.

275
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:43,607
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about a boy named Cherry who's tasked with helping a nutty professor find all the lost components of his spaceship.

276
00:19:43,627 --> 00:19:44,367
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the thing.

277
00:19:44,847 --> 00:19:46,647
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just any regular RPG.

278
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:49,008
[SPEAKER_02]: They're saying it's going to use the Wi-Fi service.

279
00:19:49,828 --> 00:19:50,168
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

280
00:19:51,104 --> 00:19:51,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Ragnarok Online

281
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:16,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Ragnarok Online on the DS

282
00:20:41,212 --> 00:20:42,854
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, what's going on with Sony's future for the PSP

283
00:21:01,295 --> 00:21:06,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's coming up a location-free TV service coming up.

284
00:21:07,381 --> 00:21:14,028
[SPEAKER_04]: What it will do is it will connect with PC, TV, and PSP, allowing access, streamed audio, visual.

285
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:16,731
[SPEAKER_04]: You can watch broadcasts over the Internet.

286
00:21:17,832 --> 00:21:21,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Using this built-in player, you'd be able to do it from anywhere with a Wi-Fi hotspot.

287
00:21:22,873 --> 00:21:31,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Also coming out is a new version of the PSP Media Manager so that it will make the transferring, converting all those files a lot simpler.

288
00:21:32,117 --> 00:21:37,239
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that that will cause some issues with people because it goes to WebMP4 format.

289
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:46,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Also they're going to relaunch their iTunes Like Connect to Music download service in March so that you can download game content.

290
00:21:48,435 --> 00:21:52,497
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, with the version 2.5 firmware that came out a few months back.

291
00:21:52,517 --> 00:21:54,039
[SPEAKER_01]: Aren't they on 2.6 now, though?

292
00:21:54,099 --> 00:21:54,959
[SPEAKER_01]: They are on 2.6.

293
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,803
[SPEAKER_01]: With 2.5 came the location-free player ability.

294
00:21:59,923 --> 00:22:06,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Now with the PSP, the only problem is the location-free player hardware part that you need on your PC or your TV.

295
00:22:07,168 --> 00:22:07,428
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about $300.

296
00:22:07,468 --> 00:22:07,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Ouch.

297
00:22:07,608 --> 00:22:07,688
[SPEAKER_01]: Ouch.

298
00:22:10,981 --> 00:22:11,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Beggar Prince

299
00:22:40,302 --> 00:22:46,426
[SPEAKER_02]: There has not been a new Sega Genesis game in America since 1998, but now there's going to be a brand new game.

300
00:22:46,487 --> 00:22:47,507
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Beggar Prince.

301
00:22:47,928 --> 00:22:50,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, it's a little bit of a role-playing game.

302
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:55,313
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about a prince who gets out of the castle but is disguised as a beggar.

303
00:22:55,393 --> 00:22:56,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, here's the thing, though.

304
00:22:56,874 --> 00:23:04,360
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually released originally in Taiwan in 1996, so they've actually just translated this to...

305
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,161
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they cost me though.

306
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:27,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, I mean, but that was, you know, the technology is so far ahead.

307
00:23:27,674 --> 00:23:34,538
[SPEAKER_02]: I could get a PlayStation 2 game or a, you know, Xbox game for 46 bucks, but I don't know.

308
00:23:34,598 --> 00:23:36,219
[SPEAKER_02]: I suppose it really doesn't matter.

309
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:38,540
[SPEAKER_02]: It just depends on how good is the game.

310
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the game fun?

311
00:23:39,901 --> 00:23:40,581
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll find out.

312
00:23:42,182 --> 00:23:47,065
[SPEAKER_02]: So apparently it's got great graphics, though, and there's a really interesting innovative combat system.

313
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:51,828
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we manage to get a hold of this game, we'll let you know how it is and follow up on it a little bit later.

314
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:53,230
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura

315
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:09,464
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd have no time to go out and stick our tongue to freezing poles

316
00:24:25,129 --> 00:24:28,412
[SPEAKER_02]: How to Treat a Tongue Stuck to a Frozen Pole

317
00:24:54,124 --> 00:24:54,805
[SPEAKER_02]: How appropriate.

318
00:24:55,025 --> 00:24:57,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one, do not pull the tongue off the pole.

319
00:24:57,928 --> 00:24:59,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Pulling sharply will be very painful.

320
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:01,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, duh.

321
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:03,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Two, move closer to the pole.

322
00:25:03,975 --> 00:25:07,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Get as close as possible without letting more of the tongue's surface area touch the pole.

323
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Three, warm the pole with your hands.

324
00:25:10,882 --> 00:25:13,624
[SPEAKER_04]: A tongue will stick when the surface of the pole is very cold.

325
00:25:14,164 --> 00:25:17,666
[SPEAKER_04]: A few top layers of the tongue will freeze when it touches the pole, causing bonding.

326
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:21,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Place your gloved hands on the area of the pole closest to the tongue.

327
00:25:21,067 --> 00:25:22,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold them there for several minutes.

328
00:25:23,369 --> 00:25:22,508
4.

329
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:24,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Take a test pole.

330
00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:27,871
[SPEAKER_04]: As the pole warms, the frozen area around your tongue should begin to thaw.

331
00:25:28,251 --> 00:25:29,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Gently pull the tongue away from the pole.

332
00:25:30,432 --> 00:25:34,655
[SPEAKER_04]: You may leave a layer or two of skin on the pole, which will be painful, but the tongue will quickly heal.

333
00:25:35,195 --> 00:25:36,495
[SPEAKER_04]: And my last piece of advice?

334
00:25:36,596 --> 00:25:37,456
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll shoot your eye out?

335
00:25:37,656 --> 00:25:39,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay inside and play more video games.

336
00:25:40,004 --> 00:25:41,945
[SPEAKER_01]: or if you've got a friend, get some warm water.

337
00:25:42,285 --> 00:25:42,685
[SPEAKER_04]: No!

338
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:43,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Play video games.

339
00:25:45,466 --> 00:25:46,787
[SPEAKER_04]: And then go out drinking sometime.

340
00:25:47,187 --> 00:25:52,208
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've basically rendered the past 54 advice columns completely useless with your little... No!

341
00:25:52,228 --> 00:25:53,009
[SPEAKER_02]: ...go inside and play games.

342
00:25:53,089 --> 00:25:55,410
[SPEAKER_04]: What if somebody is stuck on a runaway camel?

343
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:56,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

344
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:04,793
[SPEAKER_04]: But I figured, you know, no one's ever going to follow my advice anyway, as good as it is, so...

345
00:26:06,069 --> 00:26:07,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Just go play more video games.

346
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:11,351
[SPEAKER_04]: You're less in danger of getting stuck to a frozen pole or being on a runaway camel.

347
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:13,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Goodbye, DarkSakura's advice column.

348
00:26:15,112 --> 00:26:16,012
[SPEAKER_02]: We hardly knew ye.

349
00:26:16,652 --> 00:26:17,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Or we were hardly listening.

350
00:26:18,773 --> 00:26:19,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Just teasing.

351
00:26:19,553 --> 00:26:19,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Love ya.

352
00:26:20,193 --> 00:26:23,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's go on over to Loki.

353
00:26:23,534 --> 00:26:26,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki's got some stuff going on in the PSP homebrew world.

354
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:28,475
[SPEAKER_02]: What's this, one of the biggest games ever coming to the PSP?

355
00:26:28,916 --> 00:26:29,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like that.

356
00:26:30,036 --> 00:26:33,357
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, Quake 2 is being ported to the PSP.

357
00:26:34,197 --> 00:26:36,539
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're actually doing some pretty interesting stuff with it.

358
00:26:36,619 --> 00:26:43,563
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, you know, the PSP's got limited controls, you know, so how are you going to support everything that was in the PSP?

359
00:26:44,024 --> 00:26:57,192
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, basically what they're doing with Quake 2 this time is they're not only creating a control scheme that uses the actual buttons and stuff on the PSP, but they're adding the...

360
00:26:58,669 --> 00:27:01,230
[SPEAKER_01]: Remote for the headset, which is kind of neat.

361
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:10,915
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know that little headset player that no one ever uses for the PSP that plugs into the headphone slot as well as that little serial port that's on there?

362
00:27:10,935 --> 00:27:14,096
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actually using the buttons on that for different things.

363
00:27:14,136 --> 00:27:21,800
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, in actual gameplay, they have... Let's see here.

364
00:27:22,881 --> 00:27:23,461
[SPEAKER_01]: Team Emergency Exit

365
00:27:51,878 --> 00:28:06,469
[SPEAKER_01]: and they have a whole site here talking about what they're doing with the Quake 2 project and it's being developed slowly if you want to find out more about it check out teamemergencyexit.blogspot.com very cool

366
00:28:09,348 --> 00:28:14,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of controllers and innovative things, of course, Nintendo's Revolution Controller always got a lot of buzz.

367
00:28:14,794 --> 00:28:16,196
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of a follow-up here.

368
00:28:17,077 --> 00:28:30,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Eurogamer actually posted a little bit earlier a story that a lot of places were running, including us, last week about how Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess is going to be supporting the Revolution Controller.

369
00:28:30,811 --> 00:28:38,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Nintendo has actually quoted in a story on Eurogamer that the article in the January edition of NGC Magazine is speculation.

370
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:41,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo has not made an official announcement regarding this.

371
00:28:41,982 --> 00:28:43,263
[SPEAKER_02]: The game is still in development.

372
00:28:43,323 --> 00:28:45,445
[SPEAKER_02]: It will launch on the GameCube in 2006.

373
00:28:47,068 --> 00:28:49,810
[SPEAKER_02]: So they've essentially said, screw you to that rumor.

374
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:57,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Other follow-ups going on is that, you remember we mentioned on a previous podcast that PlayStation 3 is going to be getting Unreal Tournament.

375
00:28:57,854 --> 00:28:59,355
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to be a launch title.

376
00:28:59,755 --> 00:29:05,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now it's kind of going back and forth a little bit, and essentially now it's going to be a launch title.

377
00:29:05,398 --> 00:29:06,138
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to be a launch title.

378
00:29:06,158 --> 00:29:06,799
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a launch title.

379
00:29:06,819 --> 00:29:07,619
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to be a launch title.

380
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:12,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they've said, Epic has come out and said, it will be done when it's done.

381
00:29:12,922 --> 00:29:16,664
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it just so happens that it's done when the PlayStation 3 is out, great.

382
00:29:17,004 --> 00:29:19,825
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're not pushing to be a launch title or whatever.

383
00:29:19,965 --> 00:29:20,886
[SPEAKER_02]: It's done when it's done.

384
00:29:21,706 --> 00:29:23,647
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so much agony and ecstasy.

385
00:29:24,508 --> 00:29:25,448
[SPEAKER_04]: You've seen that movie, yes?

386
00:29:25,928 --> 00:29:26,148
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

387
00:29:26,649 --> 00:29:29,870
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the one about Michelangelo painting the Sistine Chapel.

388
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:31,671
[SPEAKER_04]: When will it be finished?

389
00:29:31,951 --> 00:29:32,912
[SPEAKER_04]: When it's finished?

390
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:35,813
[SPEAKER_02]: And Cultured!

391
00:29:59,749 --> 00:30:00,430
[SPEAKER_01]: That I don't get.

392
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:02,712
[SPEAKER_01]: How the F were they there and we weren't?

393
00:30:02,732 --> 00:30:03,433
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

394
00:30:03,853 --> 00:30:10,779
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, it did shed some light on how they're going to be using the Revolution controller probably for older games.

395
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:13,462
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, for example, The Legend of Zelda.

396
00:30:14,242 --> 00:30:20,508
[SPEAKER_01]: One controller will be used to slash your sword and the other controller can actually be used as a shield.

397
00:30:21,389 --> 00:30:25,012
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also a fishing minigame, which I'm assuming is in...

398
00:30:27,318 --> 00:30:28,419
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

399
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:47,285
[SPEAKER_01]: Super Smash Bros.

400
00:30:47,325 --> 00:30:47,845
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time you hold...

401
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,522
[SPEAKER_01]: You punch while holding the controller on screen.

402
00:31:12,542 --> 00:31:13,683
[SPEAKER_01]: Your character will do the same.

403
00:31:13,723 --> 00:31:17,705
[SPEAKER_01]: The Revolution Remote controller also has a rumble feature so it will vibrate whenever you hit.

404
00:31:19,567 --> 00:31:19,887
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

405
00:31:19,947 --> 00:31:20,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

406
00:31:20,727 --> 00:31:22,989
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder what they're going to do with some of the old school games with this.

407
00:31:23,309 --> 00:31:24,910
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone else brought up something very interesting.

408
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:32,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Since it does use the old GameCube controllers and it has the port on there, maybe you can use your old GameCube controllers for some of these games as well.

409
00:31:33,196 --> 00:31:35,438
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of actually having to use the Revolution controller.

410
00:31:36,538 --> 00:31:36,779
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

411
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:38,360
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

412
00:31:39,329 --> 00:31:43,810
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, let's see what people are commenting on stuff that we do.

413
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:46,051
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way we do that is we open up our old mailbag.

414
00:31:46,111 --> 00:31:49,632
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 2go at orangelaunchradio.com is the place to go if you want to get it.

415
00:31:49,952 --> 00:31:50,692
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the place to go.

416
00:31:51,072 --> 00:31:53,312
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to send us an email, 2go at orangelaunchradio.com.

417
00:31:53,332 --> 00:32:00,934
[SPEAKER_02]: But actually, that email address may be changing because we're actually dropping the 2go name from our show starting next week.

418
00:32:00,954 --> 00:32:02,395
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just going to be Orange Launch Radio.

419
00:32:03,795 --> 00:32:05,337
[SPEAKER_02]: That email address will still be good.

420
00:32:05,397 --> 00:32:05,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry.

421
00:32:06,178 --> 00:32:07,099
[SPEAKER_02]: No messages will be lost.

422
00:32:07,139 --> 00:32:09,662
[SPEAKER_02]: It will simply forward to whatever the new address ends up being.

423
00:32:10,263 --> 00:32:11,625
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll let you know what that is next week.

424
00:32:11,685 --> 00:32:15,489
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can still continue to send your messages for now at togo.org.

425
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:21,136
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where DarkSakura is going to open up the mailbag and peer in there and see what's in there.

426
00:32:21,236 --> 00:32:23,179
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do we got this week?

427
00:32:23,602 --> 00:32:26,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh god, I've got so much freaking email.

428
00:32:26,827 --> 00:32:29,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, pick a couple good ones and see what's up.

429
00:32:30,412 --> 00:32:34,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Our buddy Lord Kausu on the board, also Takuland.

430
00:32:34,778 --> 00:32:34,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

431
00:32:35,683 --> 00:32:41,248
[SPEAKER_04]: has basically pretty much corrected me on the game I was trying to think of for PC Engine, one of those betas.

432
00:32:41,908 --> 00:32:47,353
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Space Fantasy Zone, which is the one that I do not have, because it's only a beta.

433
00:32:48,074 --> 00:32:48,754
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even remember.

434
00:32:48,814 --> 00:32:49,335
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a week.

435
00:32:49,395 --> 00:32:53,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Our listeners are great at memory, but I can't even remember this discussion.

436
00:32:53,198 --> 00:32:53,999
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right, all right.

437
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:59,524
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was the other Fantasy Zone game I was trying to think of on TurboGrafx that I don't have.

438
00:33:00,606 --> 00:33:01,446
[SPEAKER_04]: because it was only beta.

439
00:33:01,866 --> 00:33:03,547
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's downloads available.

440
00:33:03,807 --> 00:33:08,028
[SPEAKER_02]: I was playing Fantasy Zone 2 on GameTap this week because I never realized that there was a Fantasy Zone 2.

441
00:33:08,768 --> 00:33:09,888
[SPEAKER_04]: I have it on Master System.

442
00:33:10,248 --> 00:33:11,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what it was on.

443
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:13,389
[SPEAKER_04]: And Fantasy Zone The Maze.

444
00:33:13,609 --> 00:33:15,510
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to point out it's the same damn thing as Fantasy Zone 1.

445
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:16,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

446
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:17,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, just wanted to make that clear.

447
00:33:18,491 --> 00:33:20,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, it sure is.

448
00:33:21,651 --> 00:33:28,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, we got... I do apologize because I'm trying to go through the list.

449
00:33:29,711 --> 00:33:44,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, someone, Crispy Creamy, emailed us, uh, saying, I heard a rumor about the PS3, is it that the PS3 will have something in each system, so when you put a new disc into your system, it marks the disc, making that disc only play on your own system.

450
00:33:45,296 --> 00:33:46,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this just a rumor?

451
00:33:46,417 --> 00:33:47,677
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to be just a rumor.

452
00:33:47,697 --> 00:33:47,957
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a rumor.

453
00:33:48,297 --> 00:33:50,758
[SPEAKER_04]: That would so lower on their marketability.

454
00:33:51,098 --> 00:33:51,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

455
00:33:51,818 --> 00:33:53,159
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would piss Gamefly off.

456
00:33:54,762 --> 00:34:20,369
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially that would kill a company like that to do that to games I think borrowing games from friends and all that stuff I think that adds to I realize I want to combat piracy but that's I don't think that's the way to do it that's not the way to combat piracy because you know then you can't let your friends borrow games that's how I found out a lot about a lot of great games especially back in the 8-bit NES day and still to some extent today so that that would not be a smart idea Sony if you're listening

457
00:34:21,052 --> 00:34:24,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Psychonauts for PsyOps, The Mindgate Conspiracy Grim Fandango, Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Monkey Island

458
00:34:43,576 --> 00:34:47,098
[SPEAKER_04]: This person has the single best name ever, by the way, My Little Pony Killer.

459
00:35:15,922 --> 00:35:16,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Chippa Thingy

460
00:35:30,793 --> 00:35:31,814
[SPEAKER_04]: I have some stuff to say, though.

461
00:35:31,874 --> 00:35:34,817
[SPEAKER_04]: First off, on the latest podcast, you read a list of games that need a sequel.

462
00:35:35,337 --> 00:35:36,738
[SPEAKER_04]: I think StarCraft should have a sequel.

463
00:35:37,138 --> 00:35:38,139
[SPEAKER_04]: That game was awesome.

464
00:35:38,279 --> 00:35:49,388
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the game that got me into PC gaming, but Brood Wars has an expansion, even though it had enough game in it to have been released as StarCraft II.

465
00:35:50,569 --> 00:35:52,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, I think Ninja Gaiden should have a true sequel.

466
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:55,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Ninja Gaiden Black was not a true sequel, and I want more.

467
00:35:56,656 --> 00:36:00,420
[SPEAKER_04]: and mentioning about bringing Ninja Gaiden 2 on Xbox Live Marketplace.

468
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,963
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's... What was that?

469
00:36:03,003 --> 00:36:04,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Tecmo did it.

470
00:36:04,384 --> 00:36:05,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Tecmo.

471
00:36:05,045 --> 00:36:07,748
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I was thinking Sega for a moment.

472
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Sega did Shinobi.

473
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,171
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I was getting confused.

474
00:36:10,191 --> 00:36:10,551
[SPEAKER_02]: But Tecmo...

475
00:36:13,454 --> 00:36:15,115
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see why they wouldn't do it.

476
00:36:15,155 --> 00:36:16,916
[SPEAKER_01]: They're buddy-buddy with Microsoft now.

477
00:36:16,936 --> 00:36:23,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember on the Super Nintendo they had the Ninja Gaiden trilogy on Super Nintendo?

478
00:36:23,699 --> 00:36:25,100
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like all three games on one cartridge.

479
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:29,262
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of interesting because it was one of the first collections I remember that early on.

480
00:36:29,603 --> 00:36:30,823
[SPEAKER_02]: But they didn't change the games at all.

481
00:36:30,843 --> 00:36:31,904
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just three games, one cart.

482
00:36:31,924 --> 00:36:32,584
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of neat.

483
00:36:33,265 --> 00:36:34,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'd like to see a more...

484
00:36:36,347 --> 00:36:40,871
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I like Ninja Gaiden, the new version and all, but I'd like to see something a little truer to the roots, sure.

485
00:36:41,211 --> 00:36:44,094
[SPEAKER_02]: But do you remember the old, old, old Ninja Gaiden arcade game?

486
00:36:44,634 --> 00:36:47,076
[SPEAKER_02]: It really didn't play like the Nintendo ones, to me anyway.

487
00:36:47,116 --> 00:36:48,718
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't play like the Nintendo ones to me at all.

488
00:36:49,939 --> 00:36:54,323
[SPEAKER_04]: But there was also an interesting question on here.

489
00:36:54,363 --> 00:36:56,605
[SPEAKER_04]: What's with this next generation pricing anyway?

490
00:36:56,965 --> 00:37:00,488
[SPEAKER_04]: You pay $10 more for the new Madden when it just has slightly prettier graphics.

491
00:37:01,009 --> 00:37:01,089
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

492
00:37:01,633 --> 00:37:04,496
[SPEAKER_01]: Their excuse is higher development costs to get these higher rents.

493
00:37:04,636 --> 00:37:05,537
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a big excuse.

494
00:37:05,597 --> 00:37:06,678
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, it's a big bunch of blah.

495
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:07,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it time.

496
00:37:07,478 --> 00:37:09,440
[SPEAKER_02]: When the other two systems come out, there'll be competition.

497
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo will try to undercut them all.

498
00:37:12,143 --> 00:37:13,544
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's the whole thing right now.

499
00:37:14,225 --> 00:37:16,126
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, okay, 360 games.

500
00:37:16,487 --> 00:37:19,690
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all coming out at $60 pretty much, except for three of them.

501
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,291
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you going to do?

502
00:37:21,652 --> 00:37:22,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Buy a different game?

503
00:37:23,073 --> 00:37:24,874
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, there's only two games coming out that month.

504
00:37:25,951 --> 00:37:27,031
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

505
00:37:55,168 --> 00:37:56,555
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like government and gaming.

506
00:37:56,595 --> 00:37:57,420
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't work.

507
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,545
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

508
00:37:58,787 --> 00:37:59,771
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other emails, DarkSakura?

509
00:38:00,563 --> 00:38:01,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, I got kind of a few.

510
00:38:01,723 --> 00:38:05,184
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got a few from our buddy Rob, who I always love hearing from.

511
00:38:05,884 --> 00:38:12,246
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm just going to go over them in a little bit of detail.

512
00:38:12,266 --> 00:38:20,428
[SPEAKER_04]: There was one about the PSP to TV converter on iGearLive.com.

513
00:38:21,288 --> 00:38:24,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Another one he sent me was a pretty long article.

514
00:38:24,589 --> 00:38:29,190
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to go into too much detail, but I would love for our listeners to read this because it's a very good article.

515
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:32,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah, I said he found it on a slash dot.

516
00:38:34,152 --> 00:38:39,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but there, it's talking about how EB and GameStop relies on used games to stay afloat.

517
00:38:39,474 --> 00:38:46,276
[SPEAKER_04]: And honestly, I can, that's all I hear about is getting those used game sales in and using that discount card and all that.

518
00:38:46,937 --> 00:38:52,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but the article is at escapistmagazine.com slash issue slash 26 slash 3.

519
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:52,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

520
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:10,648
[SPEAKER_04]: To sum it up, and I read through quite a bit of this article, it's that once more places start doing more online content, as far as the old games go, there may not be as much of a let's purchase the used games.

521
00:39:10,908 --> 00:39:16,712
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's really going to take a lot of the steam, a lot of the livelihood out of what keeps these companies alive.

522
00:39:17,153 --> 00:39:17,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

523
00:39:18,373 --> 00:39:20,734
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes sense because consider how GameStop started.

524
00:39:20,774 --> 00:39:22,694
[SPEAKER_02]: It used to be Funkoland, which I remember.

525
00:39:23,074 --> 00:39:23,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Used games!

526
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:27,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the 8-bit days, they would advertise in magazines.

527
00:39:27,576 --> 00:39:29,276
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a mail-order company for used games.

528
00:39:29,716 --> 00:39:30,116
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

529
00:39:30,316 --> 00:39:35,257
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that actually, if anything, you would want more people to buy used games.

530
00:39:35,297 --> 00:39:36,318
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, for example, Halo.

531
00:39:36,718 --> 00:39:38,498
[SPEAKER_01]: Halo 2 right now, you can buy a used.

532
00:39:38,558 --> 00:39:39,318
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty cheap.

533
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:44,460
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still one of the most widely played games out there, and you can download different content, maps, and stuff for it.

534
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,500
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sounds good to me.

535
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:49,519
[SPEAKER_04]: For the record, I would like to point out that GameStop and Funkoland were two different places.

536
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:56,504
[SPEAKER_04]: GameStop is a fully owned subsidy of Barnes & Noble.

537
00:39:56,584 --> 00:39:58,105
[SPEAKER_02]: But didn't one buy the other at some point?

538
00:39:58,166 --> 00:39:58,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

539
00:39:59,186 --> 00:40:07,253
[SPEAKER_04]: GameStop purchased Funkoland, Babbage's, Sawfare, etc.

540
00:40:08,413 --> 00:40:13,898
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're all fully owned subsidy of Barnes & Noble, which is why I get books cheap.

541
00:40:16,059 --> 00:40:17,020
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, anything else?

542
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that it for now?

543
00:40:18,181 --> 00:40:18,581
[SPEAKER_02]: For now.

544
00:40:18,802 --> 00:40:19,062
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

545
00:40:19,582 --> 00:40:20,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep them coming.

546
00:40:20,563 --> 00:40:22,365
[SPEAKER_02]: To go at orangelaunchradio.com.

547
00:40:22,525 --> 00:40:23,666
[SPEAKER_02]: We welcome your emails.

548
00:40:25,087 --> 00:40:28,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go back over to Loki, who has a story about the Eye River.

549
00:40:29,171 --> 00:40:30,132
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Eye River.

550
00:40:30,552 --> 00:40:37,418
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the thorn in all of those wonderful portable MP3 player's sides.

551
00:40:37,678 --> 00:40:41,962
[SPEAKER_01]: This time they're actually trying to get into the game market, which is quite interesting.

552
00:40:42,663 --> 00:40:44,464
[SPEAKER_01]: With the brand new iRiver G10.

553
00:40:45,084 --> 00:40:50,306
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually looks kind of like a, to be honest, it looks like one of those things that Ben Heck would have made.

554
00:40:50,346 --> 00:40:53,227
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the guy that did all those retro consoles and the portable systems.

555
00:40:54,227 --> 00:41:06,072
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, it has a nice 800x480, 260,000 color display, as well as it's running off of Windows CE 5.0, kind of like the Commodore Portable.

556
00:41:06,728 --> 00:41:13,336
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also going to contain a 4 or 6 gigabyte storage on the actual system right now.

557
00:41:13,376 --> 00:41:17,941
[SPEAKER_01]: They're kind of just showing it off as being able to play videos and stuff like that and some Korean games.

558
00:41:18,321 --> 00:41:19,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really too much on it right now.

559
00:41:20,284 --> 00:41:22,646
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are saying, oh, this could be the PSP killer.

560
00:41:22,926 --> 00:41:23,307
[SPEAKER_02]: I say no.

561
00:41:24,229 --> 00:41:25,670
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's interesting, though.

562
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:28,713
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, do you know who everybody says should be getting into gaming?

563
00:41:28,733 --> 00:41:32,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not everybody, but, you know, I keep seeing this on message forums, who they say should be getting into gaming.

564
00:41:32,916 --> 00:41:44,305
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, a lot of people think that it's one of these things where they're just going to come out of nowhere when no one realizes it, and they're either going to fully back somebody else, or they're just going to come out with their own thing that's just going to blow your effing mind.

565
00:41:44,345 --> 00:41:44,765
[SPEAKER_02]: You know who?

566
00:41:45,166 --> 00:41:45,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Apple.

567
00:41:45,506 --> 00:41:45,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Apple.

568
00:41:46,567 --> 00:41:49,029
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I just...

569
00:41:49,995 --> 00:41:50,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at them.

570
00:41:50,798 --> 00:41:52,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't they look like they're up to something?

571
00:41:52,823 --> 00:41:55,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't they just have that look on their face, Apple?

572
00:41:55,868 --> 00:42:00,772
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and they'll make a game system that looks pretty and people will buy it despite the fact that the specs suck.

573
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:02,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, who knows?

574
00:42:03,173 --> 00:42:03,474
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

575
00:42:03,514 --> 00:42:06,216
[SPEAKER_02]: I get this feeling Apple's got to be up to it.

576
00:42:06,256 --> 00:42:08,758
[SPEAKER_02]: If Apple wanted to enter the handheld market, they could.

577
00:42:08,798 --> 00:42:11,380
[SPEAKER_02]: If Apple wanted to team up with Nintendo, oh my god.

578
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,520
[SPEAKER_02]: I've said this on an earlier podcast.

579
00:42:12,981 --> 00:42:19,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Apple, Nintendo, these two companies excel at getting you to buy the same damn thing with cool new features over and over again.

580
00:42:19,586 --> 00:42:20,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the iPod.

581
00:42:20,927 --> 00:42:22,828
[SPEAKER_02]: iPod Mini, iPod Nano, iPod Video.

582
00:42:23,108 --> 00:42:24,149
[SPEAKER_02]: And look at the Game Boy Pro.

583
00:42:24,687 --> 00:42:25,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Game Boy Advance, Game Boy SB.

584
00:42:26,548 --> 00:42:29,509
[SPEAKER_02]: If these two companies got together, it would be dangerous to your wallet.

585
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:31,510
[SPEAKER_02]: But just food for thought.

586
00:42:33,091 --> 00:42:33,331
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

587
00:42:34,132 --> 00:42:41,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox 360 is pissing off Gamefly a little bit because they are getting a lot of scratched Xbox 360s back.

588
00:42:42,396 --> 00:42:46,558
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're actually having this form letter now that's going out that says, essentially...

589
00:42:47,250 --> 00:43:15,494
[SPEAKER_02]: you've been identified as somebody who sent back a scratched game to us if in the future should Gamefly receive Xbox 360 games from you that have been damaged you'll be charged a replacement fee so they're getting a little ticked off that a lot of their games are coming back scratched should be noted that we haven't really seen this for the others obviously all the systems are CD based so it seems interesting that this one's making headlines about the Xbox 360 because they're the only ones that have like a really shoddy put together CD-ROM drive that doesn't have the buffers in them to keep this level and so when you tilt it

590
00:43:16,072 --> 00:43:17,653
[SPEAKER_01]: or bump it, it scratches.

591
00:43:17,873 --> 00:43:20,516
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't move the Xbox 360 while you're playing your game.

592
00:43:21,096 --> 00:43:21,396
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

593
00:43:22,677 --> 00:43:30,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, side note though, and what I thought was quite interesting is the Xbox 360 knows whether it's on its side or on its standing up.

594
00:43:31,425 --> 00:43:36,288
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a level in there because there's a little light on the little ring of light that shows which controller is player one.

595
00:43:36,689 --> 00:43:40,072
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's on the ground, it will be still up in the upper left corner.

596
00:43:40,312 --> 00:43:44,155
[SPEAKER_01]: You tilt it up, it will move itself so that it's in the upper left corner.

597
00:43:44,873 --> 00:43:53,538
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to mention real quick, Blood Rain came out in theaters this week, you know, Uwe Boll's latest epic.

598
00:43:53,918 --> 00:43:57,360
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it grossed about a million dollars, well out of the top ten this week.

599
00:43:59,661 --> 00:44:00,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Are any of us surprised?

600
00:44:02,942 --> 00:44:06,986
[SPEAKER_01]: He has the next three films financed already, so we will be at least seeing three more films.

601
00:44:07,107 --> 00:44:10,170
[SPEAKER_04]: You know there's one of those stupid little internet petitions going on?

602
00:44:12,792 --> 00:44:13,293
[SPEAKER_02]: That's old.

603
00:44:13,373 --> 00:44:14,194
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen that before.

604
00:44:14,314 --> 00:44:15,195
[SPEAKER_04]: But it made me laugh.

605
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:16,476
[SPEAKER_02]: It really made me laugh.

606
00:44:16,496 --> 00:44:18,078
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting a resurgence now because of this movie.

607
00:44:18,398 --> 00:44:23,984
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, I should point out, internetmoviedatabase.com, it's already showing up in their bottom 100 movies of all time.

608
00:44:24,744 --> 00:44:25,565
[SPEAKER_01]: 44 last time I checked.

609
00:44:25,805 --> 00:44:27,567
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

610
00:44:27,767 --> 00:44:29,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go and get another story.

611
00:44:29,789 --> 00:44:35,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go over to DarkSakura, who has another story about the 360, something about the UK for our UK folks.

612
00:44:36,955 --> 00:44:38,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, yes, I do.

613
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:47,795
[SPEAKER_04]: There's basically a European Xbox Live marketplace has been keeping playable demos and supplies.

614
00:44:47,895 --> 00:44:55,460
[SPEAKER_04]: However, they have found a way to get American and Japanese games, some of the demos.

615
00:44:57,041 --> 00:45:06,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently the way to do that, according to GamerReport.com, is all you have to do is go to Microsoft's password site and create a new Hotmail account and then say you're either from Japan or the United States.

616
00:45:07,981 --> 00:45:08,622
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of smart.

617
00:45:08,882 --> 00:45:10,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Make a note of the phone number that you supply.

618
00:45:11,505 --> 00:45:15,809
[SPEAKER_04]: And once you've activated it, turn on your Xbox 360, press the guide button, and select Switch Profile.

619
00:45:18,254 --> 00:45:19,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh, good way to get around that.

620
00:45:19,955 --> 00:45:20,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Smart thinking, guys.

621
00:45:21,856 --> 00:45:28,539
[SPEAKER_04]: My source hasn't tried it out yet, but I would love to listen to any of our UK listeners that have an Xbox 360.

622
00:45:29,019 --> 00:45:29,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Give it a try.

623
00:45:29,479 --> 00:45:30,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me know what you find.

624
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:38,623
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it does... I have seen... This is actually also on Xbox360.qj.net, previously known as Xbox 360 Updates.

625
00:45:39,624 --> 00:45:41,584
[SPEAKER_01]: They have tried it, and it does work.

626
00:45:41,885 --> 00:45:44,726
[SPEAKER_01]: So, what you can gain, though, from...

627
00:45:46,055 --> 00:45:46,276
[SPEAKER_01]: RidgeRacer6

628
00:45:56,394 --> 00:45:58,275
[SPEAKER_01]: Virtual Reality in the Revolution, Loki?

629
00:46:23,493 --> 00:46:29,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and the continuing saga of... The continued speculation about 3D on the Revolution.

630
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:30,639
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

631
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:37,765
[SPEAKER_01]: At CES this year, they were showing off a 3D visor called the Z800 3D visor.

632
00:46:38,186 --> 00:46:39,166
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually put out...

633
00:46:40,467 --> 00:46:41,688
[SPEAKER_01]: by a third-party company.

634
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:03,591
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody is kind of taking a look at it, but still kind of backs up the whole thing, you know, virtual reality type stuff.

635
00:47:04,132 --> 00:47:06,413
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably checking out to see what their competition's doing, you know.

636
00:47:06,873 --> 00:47:12,135
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still saying, E3 this year, come find out, you're going to see something different.

637
00:47:12,515 --> 00:47:18,298
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's another thing that they've actually registered, the Nintendo, was it like Floor Vision?

638
00:47:18,618 --> 00:47:19,699
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard about that, yeah.

639
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:21,240
[SPEAKER_01]: I just love the first line of this.

640
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:22,101
[SPEAKER_01]: It's official.

641
00:47:22,121 --> 00:47:24,142
[SPEAKER_02]: The IRS has its eyes on your virtual gold.

642
00:47:24,162 --> 00:47:25,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I did hear about that.

643
00:47:25,404 --> 00:47:26,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, what's up with this?

644
00:47:42,825 --> 00:47:48,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's basically saying that they're just kind of keeping an eye on this as a potential.

645
00:47:48,809 --> 00:48:12,263
[SPEAKER_04]: But the latest issue of Legal Affairs Magazine, IRS Advisors Specializing in Barter Income, recently offered the opinion that any trade of one virtual item for another, gold pieces for thick leather, Uber drops for platinum, could constitute taxable income gathering exchange according to the IRS's rules on barter.

646
00:48:12,591 --> 00:48:14,752
[SPEAKER_02]: But how can you enforce that with a worldwide game?

647
00:48:15,352 --> 00:48:15,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.

648
00:48:16,992 --> 00:48:19,153
[SPEAKER_02]: But... They're not real items.

649
00:48:19,953 --> 00:48:20,533
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

650
00:48:21,094 --> 00:48:24,014
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the government going to do with 10 gold pieces in WoW?

651
00:48:24,094 --> 00:48:24,895
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, seriously.

652
00:48:25,095 --> 00:48:30,216
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically saying so long as each good has a determinable fair market value.

653
00:48:30,596 --> 00:48:30,796
Yeah.

654
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:32,977
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to be paying them in gold pieces.

655
00:48:32,997 --> 00:48:34,317
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to pay them in real money.

656
00:48:34,838 --> 00:48:37,298
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet, you're not actually exchanging real money in the game.

657
00:48:37,398 --> 00:48:39,499
[SPEAKER_01]: How would they enforce that out of a European player?

658
00:48:39,778 --> 00:48:41,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's basically the problem.

659
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:47,240
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to... Right now they're working on consistency for it.

660
00:48:48,261 --> 00:48:49,961
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people have objected to this.

661
00:48:50,021 --> 00:48:51,642
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, just really objected.

662
00:48:51,682 --> 00:48:51,962
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, duh.

663
00:48:52,002 --> 00:48:52,922
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to do with money.

664
00:48:56,023 --> 00:49:02,525
[SPEAKER_01]: My thing is, though, is I'm going to take significant losses in these games because if they can take it, I can take it.

665
00:49:02,565 --> 00:49:02,945
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

666
00:49:02,985 --> 00:49:04,525
[SPEAKER_01]: I could write it off, my taxes, right?

667
00:49:04,845 --> 00:49:06,546
[SPEAKER_02]: If I start a business and wow and lose money.

668
00:49:07,132 --> 00:49:16,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine just what a pain in the ass it would be for there to be issued 1099s on every single player.

669
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:21,196
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking people who aren't even old enough to be taxed.

670
00:49:22,766 --> 00:49:28,572
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't own real land, but hey, we can tax you for getting that, you know, helmet.

671
00:49:28,872 --> 00:49:30,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Something tells me this ain't gonna fly.

672
00:49:30,594 --> 00:49:31,475
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not gonna.

673
00:49:31,755 --> 00:49:32,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Weird idea.

674
00:49:32,996 --> 00:49:34,798
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it does, I'm freaking moving.

675
00:49:35,179 --> 00:49:38,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are people in the IRS actually, why are they actually looking at this?

676
00:49:38,702 --> 00:49:40,544
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, don't they have better things to do?

677
00:49:40,625 --> 00:49:42,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Because our government is PO.

678
00:49:43,848 --> 00:49:44,188
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

679
00:49:44,208 --> 00:49:44,689
[SPEAKER_02]: They want money.

680
00:49:46,209 --> 00:49:49,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantasy Star Universe is a game some of us here have our eye on.

681
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:54,754
[SPEAKER_02]: It was supposed to be coming out for PS2 and PC in Japan on February 16th, but it's been pushed back.

682
00:49:54,854 --> 00:49:59,116
[SPEAKER_02]: March 30th now is the new date that Fantasy Star Universe will be coming out.

683
00:49:59,576 --> 00:50:01,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Quality improvement is the reason.

684
00:50:02,658 --> 00:50:07,620
[SPEAKER_02]: It's unknown yet what it'll do to the US and European release dates because they weren't unscheduled.

685
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:13,163
[SPEAKER_02]: So, spring, summer, who knows, but Fantasy Star Universe is at least making its debut sometime in 2006.

686
00:50:13,303 --> 00:50:14,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Should be interesting.

687
00:50:15,686 --> 00:50:18,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki's got one more story for us tonight regarding Mario Mix.

688
00:50:20,047 --> 00:50:24,348
[SPEAKER_01]: Mario Mix, it's official from Nintendo.

689
00:50:24,709 --> 00:50:26,729
[SPEAKER_01]: They won't sell anymore.

690
00:50:27,949 --> 00:50:28,590
[SPEAKER_01]: It's done.

691
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:35,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, whether it's coming back at some point, who knows, but you're not going to be able to find it because stores can't do reorders on it.

692
00:50:36,292 --> 00:50:38,692
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not making any more as far as it's concerned right now.

693
00:50:39,613 --> 00:50:40,873
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you own it, lucky you.

694
00:50:41,013 --> 00:50:41,713
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a collector's item.

695
00:50:41,813 --> 00:50:42,834
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's gone.

696
00:50:42,854 --> 00:50:44,194
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have bought it when I had the chance.

697
00:50:44,847 --> 00:50:46,408
[SPEAKER_01]: Final Fantasy XII PlayStation 2 coming out March 16th in Japan.

698
00:51:13,931 --> 00:51:15,993
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's going to be going out for an open price.

699
00:51:16,714 --> 00:51:17,535
[SPEAKER_02]: What the heck does this mean?

700
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:21,058
[SPEAKER_02]: This means that there is no set manufacturer suggested retail.

701
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:24,762
[SPEAKER_02]: The stores can just sell it at whatever price they want to set.

702
00:51:25,222 --> 00:51:34,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, Sony and Square Enix sets a price to the retailers, so I don't know, this whole thing doesn't really make sense to me, but the retailers can choose their own profit levels, which I think is very interesting.

703
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:49,681
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a wild guess here, and since there is no profit in systems, as we had a conversation earlier this week about how systems are sold for about $5 more than what the retailer pays for them, so my guess is going to be maybe around what they're paying for them.

704
00:51:50,381 --> 00:51:56,288
[SPEAKER_02]: And get this, you also get with this a PlayStation 2 stand and a Final Fantasy XII phone strap.

705
00:51:59,705 --> 00:52:02,827
[SPEAKER_02]: One more story for us tonight, and DarkSakura is bringing it to us.

706
00:52:02,907 --> 00:52:07,471
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to do with a new game coming out featuring some classic characters.

707
00:52:08,192 --> 00:52:10,734
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember talking about these guys before, so what's happening?

708
00:52:11,494 --> 00:52:13,156
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a little tiny something.

709
00:52:13,216 --> 00:52:18,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Namco, I love Namco, has basically confirmed for us Snoopy vs. the Red Baron.

710
00:52:20,712 --> 00:52:37,986
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's where Snoopy has a magical dream and becomes a World War 1 flying ace who must pilot a biplane to stop the Red Baron Crimson Skies featuring Snoopy is great I just think that's going to be cool I'm hoping that they have the unlockable Snoopy's doghouse as the plane

711
00:52:39,529 --> 00:52:46,573
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping they have the unlockable minigame where Charlie Brown tries to kick that football from that fucking bitch that never lets him do it.

712
00:52:46,713 --> 00:52:47,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Lucy.

713
00:52:47,313 --> 00:52:47,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Lucy.

714
00:52:49,434 --> 00:52:51,035
[SPEAKER_02]: You can finally kick the damn ball.

715
00:52:51,315 --> 00:52:53,537
[SPEAKER_04]: And steer past the kite eating tree.

716
00:52:57,579 --> 00:52:58,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Linus searches for his blanket.

717
