Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio episode number 171, the second half here for this

00:26.480 --> 00:29.080
January 22, 2006.

00:29.080 --> 00:33.760
lively first half there I just made the official donation there during the break

00:33.760 --> 00:37.380
I went on to the live journal community thing and donated for the flowers for

00:37.380 --> 00:41.200
Jack thing and I left a little message twenty dollars from us so it'll be

00:41.200 --> 00:44.260
lovely we'll see what happens with that I just hope I didn't fund somebody's

00:44.260 --> 00:47.960
vacation to Tahiti so that's why I didn't send my own goes to Tahiti I know

00:47.960 --> 00:52.600
anyway all right anyway let's get right back into the news yes we will be

00:52.600 --> 00:55.360
opening up the skype line a little later on for those of you guys in our chat

00:55.360 --> 00:58.920
room by the way I think we set a new record in chat tonight for the number of

00:58.920 --> 01:02.080
people that we have watching in our chat room tonight so thank you guys so much

01:02.080 --> 01:07.080
for making this combined show a success and making our live show really take off

01:07.080 --> 01:10.600
we appreciate it and of course those you listen on the podcast too we know not

01:10.600 --> 01:13.040
everybody can watch Sunday night because you know some of you guys are watching

01:13.040 --> 01:15.440
what are the big TV shows on Sunday night? Family Guy? Some of you guys are watching

01:15.440 --> 01:20.000
Family Guy and the other stuff going out. Don't give them ideas. I know I shouldn't give them ideas

01:20.000 --> 01:24.280
sorry sorry don't watch Family Guy sucks now it's not as good as the first couple

01:24.280 --> 01:25.280
seasons.

01:25.280 --> 01:30.220
Did she be as brilliant as me and not watch TV?

01:30.220 --> 01:32.560
You know, this is somewhat gaming related.

01:32.560 --> 01:35.180
I'm going to kind of go off on a random tangent, I don't care.

01:35.180 --> 01:39.060
I was watching 24, I only watched the first half, because you know they did this four

01:39.060 --> 01:43.160
hour premiere thing last week, I only watched the first half of it, because that's a lot

01:43.160 --> 01:45.280
of TV, I mean, hooray for DVR.

01:45.280 --> 01:49.040
But I was thinking while I was watching it, the show is so suspenseful and very, I don't

01:49.040 --> 01:53.120
know, like Metal Gear-esque, I'm thinking, gosh, this show would make a great video game

01:53.120 --> 01:55.080
And then I was like, oh yeah, there is a video game.

01:55.080 --> 01:59.680
I remember seeing the trailer at E3, but it's been in development for so long that I believe

01:59.680 --> 02:02.940
the story was supposed to be between seasons two and three.

02:02.940 --> 02:03.940
That's correct.

02:03.940 --> 02:07.800
But I don't want to spoil anything, but this show has a tendency to kill off characters

02:07.800 --> 02:09.400
that you really get attached to.

02:09.400 --> 02:12.760
So I think it's very interesting that the game is possibly going to have characters

02:12.760 --> 02:14.800
that have now been killed off.

02:14.800 --> 02:16.680
It's coming out the end of February.

02:16.680 --> 02:17.680
Oh, good.

02:17.680 --> 02:19.460
I really hope it doesn't stink.

02:19.460 --> 02:20.460
It looks good.

02:20.460 --> 02:24.500
same writers same the cast is lending their voice and appearance and the

02:24.500 --> 02:29.660
appearances to it sounds good that's good yeah you know it's a good show so

02:29.660 --> 02:34.020
I'm thinking it'll be a good game but not as good as games that were out on

02:34.020 --> 02:37.980
the Commodore 64 and I'll tell you what a lot of people say that they grew up on

02:37.980 --> 02:43.980
Atari 2600 or they grew up on Nintendo Coleco vision Coleco vision Odyssey

02:43.980 --> 02:50.380
whatever was arcades I grew up on the Commodore 64 so Loki what did you find

02:50.380 --> 02:54.620
find out in Commodore 64 news believe it or not this um well actually it's

02:54.620 --> 03:00.820
available you can play Commodore 64 games online available through c64 s

03:00.820 --> 03:04.940
dot-com and you can actually check out they have a ton of games on there

03:04.940 --> 03:11.180
including commando the great Gianna sisters bubble bubble boulder dash

03:11.180 --> 03:18.420
Ghostbusters ghosts and goblins paper boy Bruce Lee boulder dash 2 and blue

03:18.420 --> 03:23.820
Max as the top ten right now. Oh my gosh, I had Blue Max. That's crazy. I had quite a...

03:23.820 --> 03:27.860
Boulder Dash, I had that game too, and of course, Arkon. Yeah. Oh my gosh. What about

03:27.860 --> 03:33.400
The Last Ninja? That game was awesome. Um, Spy vs. Spy. What about Spy vs. Spy? Um, tons

03:33.400 --> 03:38.140
of Boulder Dash stuff on here. Bomb Jack. It was a huge title. Commando 2. Yeah. Back

03:38.140 --> 03:43.640
to the Future. Outrun. Pitfall in the Commodore 64. Pitfall. You know, a lot of games that

03:43.640 --> 03:47.840
we're on Atari we're on Commodore 64 but with better graphics and that's one of

03:47.840 --> 03:51.440
them and also I'm the one that comes to mind is H-E-R-O which is a game I play a

03:51.440 --> 03:55.580
hell of a lot of on GameTap the graphics on Commodore 64 were way better than the

03:55.580 --> 03:59.540
ones on Atari which kind of makes me sad because they don't have the Commodore version on GameTap.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.040
They have about a hundred games on there.

04:01.040 --> 04:03.340
Awesome. Now you know I gotta ask is this legal?

04:03.340 --> 04:07.340
I don't know. Who cares?

04:07.340 --> 04:10.940
Well I'm okay it's a little bit of a gray area but okay

04:10.940 --> 04:14.780
that's still kinda cool. There were some awesome games on the Commodore 64

04:14.780 --> 04:18.700
but I bet a lot of people are gonna load them up now and go, you know

04:18.700 --> 04:22.140
clunky, bad graphics, but such good memories. Is Beachhead in there?

04:22.140 --> 04:26.060
Beachhead was awesome too. I don't know. Yeah, good times.

04:26.060 --> 04:29.300
Alright. Check that out.

04:29.300 --> 04:32.740
Relive your youth. You know because some of those, of course I checked out

04:32.740 --> 04:35.140
Commodore 64 emulators and they were first like the big

04:35.140 --> 04:38.340
you know things in the emulator scene and a lot of them were just really clunky and

04:38.340 --> 04:40.700
hard to use so I like this idea of having it

04:40.700 --> 04:44.540
much easier and kinda streamline in the website very nice

04:44.540 --> 04:50.300
alright let's move on to a very very new game in a very very

04:50.300 --> 04:54.240
popular game in this day and age World of war crack I talked about it earlier in

04:54.240 --> 04:54.900
the show

04:54.900 --> 04:58.100
there's some stuff coming up for what's going on with World of Warcraft, Jamie you

04:58.100 --> 04:58.660
first

04:58.660 --> 05:03.140
well I'm actually they're going to be celebrating the

05:03.140 --> 05:06.640
lunar new year in World of Warcraft

05:06.640 --> 05:10.420
it will be between a they'll be

05:10.420 --> 05:17.320
There's a celebration, they're saying, as in S-A-L-E, they'll be getting sparkly in

05:17.320 --> 05:21.700
Azeroth on account of the Lunar New Year, is what it says, between January 27th and

05:21.700 --> 05:26.540
February 14th, there'll be celebrations focusing on Moonglade, the 29th will also see celebrations

05:26.540 --> 05:31.440
in Stormwind, Thunder Bluff, and Booty Bay.

05:31.440 --> 05:38.260
And while every capital will be decorated, on February 13th, there will be a fire show

05:38.260 --> 05:43.580
of Moonglade paralleling the Chinese Festival of Lanterns, so they'll be a humongous light

05:43.580 --> 05:44.580
show.

05:44.580 --> 05:53.980
Gameplay based events going on based on Azeroth's ancestors, quests for holiday items as rewards,

05:53.980 --> 05:59.700
tokens that can be redeemed for rockets and fireworks and festival dumplings and different

05:59.700 --> 06:01.420
outfits available for the Lunar Holidays.

06:01.420 --> 06:03.540
Does Blizzard know how to throw a party or what?

06:03.540 --> 06:04.540
Seriously?

06:04.540 --> 06:06.040
They do some fun events.

06:06.040 --> 06:10.400
I saw an interesting response to this though on some message board is that they were saying

06:10.400 --> 06:14.500
that this was a kind of a way for World of Warcraft to kind of appeal to the Chinese

06:14.500 --> 06:18.920
players right now because I guess they did something, I haven't really been following

06:18.920 --> 06:21.920
a lot of WoW drama, but I guess maybe they did something to kind of turn the Chinese

06:21.920 --> 06:24.800
players off when they launched the games there, so they're saying that this is kind of a way

06:24.800 --> 06:31.280
to show that, oh we can do, you know, oh maybe it was because of like the more, you know,

06:31.280 --> 06:35.140
U.S. culture events that they did like for the holidays and Halloween and stuff, so maybe

06:35.140 --> 06:38.920
this is a way to kind of show that you know we can do the Chinese events too so

06:38.920 --> 06:42.360
kind of interesting I don't know if that's true or not but it's just an

06:42.360 --> 06:46.320
interesting perspective on that. Loki you have completely different news of the

06:46.320 --> 06:53.280
WoW kind. Yes actually what's kind of cool is World of Warcraft has surpassed

06:53.280 --> 06:58.160
their 1 million European player mark so now over a million people playing in

06:58.160 --> 07:03.560
Europe since the launch or that was a you know less than a year ago bringing

07:03.560 --> 07:09.160
the total number of subscribers to the game worldwide to about 5.5 million this

07:09.160 --> 07:14.280
also just in World of Warcraft will soon be renaming itself to just the world

07:14.280 --> 07:18.400
that was a dot hat joke dot hack joke for those of you guys that didn't get

07:18.400 --> 07:26.480
that oh yeah I made a joke haha why this is why I do a podcast out of the spare

07:26.480 --> 07:32.560
bedroom of an apartment and I don't do comedy low-key speaking of other things

07:32.560 --> 07:38.800
I can't do one of them is play an Xbox 360 because I still have yet to find one of these little bastards

07:38.800 --> 07:42.560
But that doesn't stop the Xbox 360 news from coming in and holy crap

07:42.560 --> 07:47.200
Do you have a lot of it tonight starting off with Japan? Are they buying them yet?

07:47.200 --> 07:54.140
Nope, not buying them in Japan. In fact only about seven thousand four hundred and seventy seven systems have sold there

07:55.040 --> 08:01.080
And I think I mentioned last week that they're being beaten out by every other console system out there

08:01.080 --> 08:05.080
which is pretty bad and as far as the US sales go

08:05.080 --> 08:09.080
including Gizmondo, believe it or not, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, including the US sales

08:09.080 --> 08:13.080
you know they've only sold only about 600,000 which is

08:13.080 --> 08:17.080
pretty pitiful. Let's see, now the other thing

08:17.080 --> 08:21.080
that we have here is they were kind of going back and forth on whether they wanted

08:21.080 --> 08:25.080
third party, or not third party, external Blu-ray

08:25.080 --> 08:29.080
or external HD DVD drive, now of course they're backing HD

08:29.080 --> 08:34.920
DVD 100% whether, you know, it becomes the format of choice or not.

08:34.920 --> 08:37.840
Wasn't there a little bit of like backtracking this week where it's like, well we might still

08:37.840 --> 08:38.840
do a Blu-ray.

08:38.840 --> 08:40.680
It's kind of like, well wait and see.

08:40.680 --> 08:42.160
Are they committing or what?

08:42.160 --> 08:43.160
They're committing.

08:43.160 --> 08:44.160
Alright.

08:44.160 --> 08:46.240
So, you know, we'll see.

08:46.240 --> 08:50.280
That's kind of, you know, what I'm thinking, but okay.

08:50.280 --> 08:58.080
Anyways, the other thing is there's some, they released a list of the top ten online,

08:58.080 --> 09:03.220
Xbox Live arcade games that are out right now and the most downloads that they've had.

09:03.220 --> 09:07.680
To no surprise, number one, Geometry Wars, which is the main reason why a lot of people

09:07.680 --> 09:09.500
are actually getting an Xbox 360.

09:09.500 --> 09:11.100
Screw Call of Duty.

09:11.100 --> 09:12.100
Screw it.

09:12.100 --> 09:13.100
Right in the air.

09:13.100 --> 09:14.100
Call of Duty is fun.

09:14.100 --> 09:15.100
Okay.

09:15.100 --> 09:19.820
Now, Gauntlet, number two, the retro Gauntlet, that surprised me because I thought Smash

09:19.820 --> 09:20.820
TV would have been number two.

09:20.820 --> 09:22.500
Smash TV is number three.

09:22.500 --> 09:23.500
There you go.

09:23.500 --> 09:25.100
Bejeweled 2, number four.

09:25.100 --> 09:27.620
Zuma, number five.

09:27.620 --> 09:30.220
Bankshop Billiards, which is number six.

09:30.220 --> 09:32.040
Correct me if I'm wrong, Zuma and Bejeweled,

09:32.040 --> 09:36.120
two games you can play online for free, right?

09:36.120 --> 09:36.960
Yeah.

09:36.960 --> 09:38.080
Already, okay, just checking.

09:38.080 --> 09:40.440
Do those games offer achievements, though?

09:40.440 --> 09:41.960
Well, all of them do.

09:41.960 --> 09:43.360
That must be why people download it,

09:43.360 --> 09:46.400
because they want to make their Xbox 360 wang bigger.

09:46.400 --> 09:47.240
Exactly.

09:48.520 --> 09:51.240
Let's see, Outpost Colloquy,

09:51.240 --> 09:54.800
which is supposedly a pretty cool sim-type game.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.680
Mutant Storm Reloaded, which is awesome,

09:56.680 --> 10:00.240
I'm surprised it's still down on the bottom of the list there, because it's very similar

10:00.240 --> 10:05.840
to Geometry Wars, uh, Joust, which is kind of an enhanced version of Joust, and then

10:05.840 --> 10:11.480
Wick, Fable of Souls, which sucks ass, because I bought that game for, I don't know why,

10:11.480 --> 10:13.840
but it's not very fun.

10:13.840 --> 10:16.800
Well that's why it's the number 10, the bottom spot, because there isn't much more than that

10:16.800 --> 10:18.680
out on Xbox Live right now, is there?

10:18.680 --> 10:21.720
There's a few things, like some card games, but uh, yeah.

10:21.720 --> 10:22.720
Alright.

10:22.720 --> 10:23.720
That's pretty much it for now.

10:23.720 --> 10:24.720
Alright, sounds good.

10:24.720 --> 10:25.720
What else is going on?

10:25.720 --> 10:33.320
news, we've got also kind of tying in with the pitiful sales of the 360.

10:33.320 --> 10:39.080
GameStop right now they still have 3% of the original November 22nd launch orders that

10:39.080 --> 10:43.520
they still haven't filled yet because they're waiting on more Xboxes to come in.

10:43.520 --> 10:48.240
It's a good thing I didn't wait for mine because I could still be waiting right now.

10:48.240 --> 10:53.640
Of course they're getting more units in each week, it's just they're surprised it's taking

10:53.640 --> 11:00.200
so long and they're thinking that the pre-orders will still be there until February.

11:00.200 --> 11:03.080
I'm wondering how many of them are getting canceled because people are finding them through

11:03.080 --> 11:04.080
other means.

11:04.080 --> 11:08.600
There's a lot of people canceling them but even still that's not really affecting anything.

11:08.600 --> 11:13.520
The other thing is there's going to be a major update through Xbox Live.

11:13.520 --> 11:18.520
The main feature that's going to be added to it is a webcam feature which you may have

11:18.520 --> 11:24.080
seen in the early shots of the 360 they had a webcam type of utility that looked like

11:24.080 --> 11:28.080
an iToy type of thing. That's going to be added and launched at the same time as this

11:28.080 --> 11:32.260
update. Isn't this kind of rumor status still? Or has this been confirmed? No, this has been

11:32.260 --> 11:36.840
confirmed that this is going to happen. Right now there are going to be another thing that

11:36.840 --> 11:42.320
they are talking about adding later on will be the ability to actually create custom themes

11:42.320 --> 11:49.520
for your desktop and stuff or your dashboard and custom gamertag pictures and stuff.

11:49.520 --> 11:52.620
So that's something to look forward to.

11:52.620 --> 11:56.160
It's great that they're working on that end of things, unfortunately they're not working

11:56.160 --> 12:03.260
on the end of Backwards Compatibility, which is a pitiful 200 games right now, most of

12:03.260 --> 12:05.280
which you probably wouldn't want to play anyways.

12:05.280 --> 12:08.440
Oh I don't know, Loki, Halo?

12:08.440 --> 12:13.840
will find. Halo and Halo 2, those are the only games right now that are backwards compatible

12:13.840 --> 12:20.840
with it that are worth playing, but anyways, those don't actually work 100%, by the way.

12:22.640 --> 12:26.320
But if you're expecting more games to be added, like Microsoft said, they're going to be adding

12:26.320 --> 12:30.100
more and more each week. I think, again, they're taking a vacation. You're not going to see

12:30.100 --> 12:34.440
any more updates to the backwards compatibility until about March or April.

12:34.440 --> 12:37.520
hopefully they're taking a vacation down into the factory to build some more

12:37.520 --> 12:38.800
Xbox 360's

12:38.800 --> 12:43.200
it's sad they've only had two updates to the whole

12:43.200 --> 12:46.200
backwards compatibility thing since launch so

12:46.200 --> 12:49.880
it wasn't gonna be a weekly thing so Microsoft learning

12:49.880 --> 12:53.880
to disappoint some comments from learning

12:53.880 --> 12:57.040
you mean they didn't already know well they're perfecting disappointment

12:57.040 --> 13:00.240
some comments from the chat room a wonder dog Harold says don't forget that

13:00.240 --> 13:01.900
Barbie game is backwards compatible

13:01.900 --> 13:06.020
Oh, I'm sorry. All the kids want to play that. Reenie has a response to the webcam thing.

13:06.020 --> 13:09.560
Hooray for webcams! Let's see people's asses and peni,

13:09.560 --> 13:12.400
which I think is the plural term for, you know,

13:12.400 --> 13:18.900
wang. Yeah. www.orangelandradio.com. Click on chat, by the way, to join our chat if

13:18.900 --> 13:21.640
you're listening live on Sunday night. But our chat room, you know, our chat room's

13:21.640 --> 13:22.200
swinging

13:22.200 --> 13:24.880
during the week, too, as well, for those of you guys listening on the podcast, because we do

13:24.880 --> 13:26.740
other live shows here on Orange Land Radio,

13:26.740 --> 13:29.940
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday night, and they're not podcasts. We just don't have the

13:29.940 --> 13:30.820
bandwidth, people.

13:30.820 --> 13:33.780
so you have to listen live if you want to hear it and we play a whole lot of

13:33.780 --> 13:37.620
copyrighted music because we can it's all legal through Live 365

13:37.620 --> 13:40.820
our friends and buddies over there at Live 365 who

13:40.820 --> 13:44.500
have been hosting us for so long and taking our money

13:44.500 --> 13:47.780
ah and now for something completely different another way you can

13:47.780 --> 13:51.380
interact with our show is not just through chat not just through skype

13:51.380 --> 13:56.100
but there's the old email and you send us an email to mailbag at orangelounge

13:56.100 --> 14:00.180
radio.com and Jamie she looks in there in the

14:00.180 --> 14:06.060
cavernous mailbag and pulls out a few of her favorite emails what you find for us

14:06.060 --> 14:11.100
this week well we get so many I have to really be I try to reply to as many as

14:11.100 --> 14:17.200
possible now you see I could reply to everybody huh we loved well that's thank

14:17.200 --> 14:21.400
you you guys are awesome thank you um anyway we actually and I wanted to go

14:21.400 --> 14:29.040
ahead and give them a shout out gorilla at three guys three beers calm they do a

14:29.040 --> 14:37.680
a podcast um actually wrote in um supporting the mac oh not this again yes this again oh

14:37.680 --> 14:43.440
boy i'm going to just uh read a little bit of this if i may is it all i wanted to say

14:43.440 --> 14:48.560
loki suit up abestos i know i know they're gunning for you here all the mac fans are

14:50.320 --> 14:55.680
whatever it's just my opinion i didn't you know let her speak whatever i just like this quote here

14:55.680 --> 15:00.680
Well, if I drive a dump truck at work, does that mean I have to drive one for my own personal car?

15:00.680 --> 15:02.680
In reference to the PC.

15:02.680 --> 15:03.680
Okay.

15:03.680 --> 15:09.680
Um, you know, he says Windows has, um, I'm going to read this line here.

15:09.680 --> 15:12.680
So if someone is all about games, yeah, Windows has many more.

15:12.680 --> 15:17.680
If someone is about music, podcasting, graphics, internet pictures, making personal DVDs, movies, Mac is the way to go.

15:17.680 --> 15:21.680
And honestly, I have to agree, I can't wait until I get my Mac.

15:21.680 --> 15:25.300
but he also says he can do

15:25.300 --> 15:28.840
you know a Mac with OS X what he does on his PC and you can

15:28.840 --> 15:32.160
you can actually customize how your Mac works so I fully agree with that

15:32.160 --> 15:35.600
and also just to read up the last full

15:35.600 --> 15:39.360
paragraph in here it's like well said enough once again great show keep it up

15:39.360 --> 15:42.480
I like that just don't talk trash about Macs Logie

15:42.480 --> 15:46.320
talk about jumping to the past Windows looks just as shitty as it did back in the

15:46.320 --> 15:47.960
early nineties can't polish a turd

15:47.960 --> 15:57.960
How many PC's out there are running Windows? How many are running Mac OS X?

15:57.960 --> 15:58.960
Yeah, I think so.

15:58.960 --> 16:03.960
Oh man, all those features that a Mac can do. Yeah, a PC can do just as well, if not better.

16:03.960 --> 16:08.960
So, whatever, you know. It's my opinion. I don't care. You can go ahead and bitch and moan about it.

16:08.960 --> 16:12.960
I will never buy Mac products ever and this includes the iPods, you know.

16:12.960 --> 16:16.960
I'm wondering how actual numbers is opinion. Actual numbers are facts.

16:16.960 --> 16:21.240
I think I went into the mailbag earlier this week and I was looking at random emails.

16:21.240 --> 16:22.240
I don't know if you're going to read this one.

16:22.240 --> 16:23.240
If you are, I'm sorry.

16:23.240 --> 16:26.960
But there was one email that pretty much simply said something like, you know, I'm a Mac user.

16:26.960 --> 16:28.040
Sky, you're cool.

16:28.040 --> 16:29.040
You moderate.

16:29.040 --> 16:30.040
Jamie, you rock.

16:30.040 --> 16:31.040
Loki, fuck you.

16:31.040 --> 16:32.040
Yeah.

16:32.040 --> 16:34.040
I think I forwarded that one.

16:34.040 --> 16:35.440
I really don't care.

16:35.440 --> 16:39.240
Everyone keeps bringing this up to me because they want me to argue about it and I really

16:39.240 --> 16:40.720
don't care if you use a Mac.

16:40.720 --> 16:43.640
I'm never going to use it because I don't buy computers based on flavors.

16:43.640 --> 16:46.480
So alright, moving on.

16:46.480 --> 16:51.880
One of our listeners, Terri wrote in, said, just wanted to say, enjoy your new format,

16:51.880 --> 16:52.880
thank you.

16:52.880 --> 16:55.440
Due to time constraints, it was hard for me to catch your live show.

16:55.440 --> 16:58.120
Combining your podcast and live show works great for me.

16:58.120 --> 17:00.940
Also wanted to mention that I really enjoyed the freeze pop interview.

17:00.940 --> 17:04.520
Like Loki, I'm not too into that type of music, but I admit that I did enjoy the song you

17:04.520 --> 17:05.520
played on the podcast.

17:05.520 --> 17:07.000
Keep up the good work and happy 2006.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.880
You also told me to get over my virus.

17:10.880 --> 17:15.980
You know, it's funny, I don't have the same thing I had before, I have a sinus infection

17:15.980 --> 17:17.880
know which I'm taking antibiotics for.

17:17.880 --> 17:20.380
Somebody wrote to my personal email suggesting you take a vitamin.

17:20.380 --> 17:25.260
Me take a vitamin!

17:25.260 --> 17:30.580
I mentioned that you used to work for GNC, so you're pretty well up on the vitamins.

17:30.580 --> 17:33.380
I thank them for their concern.

17:33.380 --> 17:37.340
You attract the fanboys and the bugs.

17:37.340 --> 17:52.020
Anyway, also we got an email from Press Start about the comment about Tetris.

17:52.020 --> 17:54.940
In fact the email was labeled Tetris is Great.

17:54.940 --> 17:58.860
Says yes every new console released for all eternity should have some version of Tetris.

17:58.860 --> 18:02.860
Actually rephrased every new console released for all eternity should have the Gameboy version

18:02.860 --> 18:04.100
of Tetris.

18:04.100 --> 18:09.880
And also Scorched Earth, because that game is one of the best multiplayer games ever.

18:09.880 --> 18:18.440
He also brought up Tetranet, and was pretty sad to find that it's gone.

18:18.440 --> 18:19.440
It's still around somewhere.

18:19.440 --> 18:23.040
One of my friends, somebody who's been on the live show before, before we switched his

18:23.040 --> 18:27.680
format, Bugged, he posted in LiveJournal, he said something like, Damn you, OrangeLounge,

18:27.680 --> 18:32.380
I was listening to the podcast last week and I started a Tetranet server.

18:32.380 --> 18:35.020
So it's still around somewhere, just you gotta dig deep.

18:35.020 --> 18:37.860
I have tetranet somewhere on my computer.

18:37.860 --> 18:38.860
You only need the program.

18:38.860 --> 18:41.220
Well, I wanted to read this paragraph in the letter.

18:41.220 --> 18:42.220
Sure.

18:42.220 --> 18:45.720
Um, also, now that you have all this time and you don't have to do your show as if you're

18:45.720 --> 18:51.100
playing Daytona USA News Topic Checkpoint, time extended, I have a suggestion.

18:51.100 --> 18:55.140
Please have a segment for rarities and or underrated titles.

18:55.140 --> 18:58.860
You mentioned the game Cloud a while back, which was a free download of a student-created

18:58.860 --> 18:59.860
game.

18:59.860 --> 19:01.640
Pretty cool, I never would have discovered it otherwise.

19:01.640 --> 19:05.480
You should devote time for allowing us listeners to discover these hard-to-find gems.

19:05.480 --> 19:09.760
I think as gamers, all of us are bored of the same old urban life extreme sport street

19:09.760 --> 19:10.760
racing game.

19:10.760 --> 19:13.560
That's why we're all such big music fans.

19:13.560 --> 19:15.840
By the way, I am the self-proclaimed guitar hero master.

19:15.840 --> 19:21.840
I have five stars for all but five songs on Expert because it's such a unique gaming experience.

19:21.840 --> 19:22.840
Very cool.

19:22.840 --> 19:23.840
I like that idea about the new segment.

19:23.840 --> 19:28.080
You can come over and unlock all the songs on the game.

19:28.080 --> 19:30.600
Even with the two hours thing, we have a bit of a time concern.

19:30.600 --> 19:32.040
We'll certainly consider it.

19:32.040 --> 19:35.460
One of the best ways that we can keep you guys in touch with what's great out there

19:35.460 --> 19:39.080
and what's new and what's free is email us and let us know and let Jamie sort through

19:39.080 --> 19:40.080
that.

19:40.080 --> 19:44.760
I also received an email from Jeremy who says

19:45.520 --> 19:49.820
You asked about cheat when we changed in the email dress. It actually has already changed. Just the to go still works

19:49.820 --> 19:54.560
I'm checking all of them. Yeah, that's why I said I have a whole bunch right now to go through

19:55.400 --> 19:59.700
Also about Dance Dance Revolution supernova. Is it only going to be in the arcades?

19:59.700 --> 20:02.900
Is there any chance of being able to play the new game at home?

20:03.040 --> 20:05.720
There are no arcades near so it'll be pretty hard to play this game

20:05.720 --> 20:10.400
Also he loves the new format having twice as much to listen to each week is awesome. Oh, thank you

20:10.700 --> 20:15.300
But I I'm sure that it's a matter of time till we see it, but you know

20:16.480 --> 20:21.600
It'll be eventually. I'm sure if it's very popular also one last one

20:23.340 --> 20:25.340
Blaze gamer dude 1212

20:26.220 --> 20:31.300
Said I'm started listening to the show about two months ago has to say the things the three of us are amazingly good at what we

20:31.300 --> 20:32.660
do

20:32.660 --> 20:37.460
Hugs and please continue to do what you were doing. However, I want to collect Loki. He's a crab

20:37.460 --> 20:41.780
Sorry, correct. Loki. He said that the site for the new Xbox Live diamond is

20:42.300 --> 20:45.620
www.xboxlivediamondcard.com and it isn't

20:48.100 --> 20:51.580
After hearing the xboxlivediamond.com site was fake

20:53.860 --> 20:58.460
It went to xbox.com and look through the site to get the diamond card site

20:58.460 --> 21:00.860
and it actually is xboxlivediamond.com

21:00.860 --> 21:01.860
Is that still going on?

21:01.860 --> 21:02.860
I guess it's not going on.

21:02.860 --> 21:05.940
Yeah, they're still advertising even on the dashboard for 360.

21:05.940 --> 21:06.940
It's like...

21:06.940 --> 21:07.940
Cool.

21:07.940 --> 21:08.940
Deal.

21:08.940 --> 21:09.940
I haven't gotten my card.

21:09.940 --> 21:10.940
I signed up the first day they had it, so...

21:10.940 --> 21:12.740
Yeah, they'll make those when they make more 360s.

21:12.740 --> 21:14.060
Yeah, I'm sure.

21:14.060 --> 21:17.820
A little addition, he also says that for fans of Triple Triad, he found the game online

21:17.820 --> 21:20.340
as Google's Triple Triad Gold.

21:20.340 --> 21:22.860
Alright, very cool.

21:22.860 --> 21:26.220
Did you have the email from the other podcaster that sent us the email?

21:26.220 --> 21:27.220
If not, I can pull it up, because I read it too.

21:27.220 --> 21:28.220
I'm sure I did.

21:28.220 --> 21:34.160
cover that okay I actually um received an email from another podcaster sent us

21:34.160 --> 21:38.200
a message and it was from let's say I gotta find it in here somewhere I came

21:38.200 --> 21:43.600
from Godfrey who's over at a gamertag radio his name in that show and they

21:43.600 --> 21:47.000
wanted to tell us about this segment that was going on that they covered in

21:47.000 --> 21:50.780
their latest episode because it was the episode they put out on Martin Luther

21:50.780 --> 21:55.840
King jr. day it was their episode 35 and they covered racism in video games and

21:55.840 --> 22:00.940
hip-hop and so I actually went over to listen now just I I don't listen to a

22:00.940 --> 22:05.260
lot of gaming podcasts and that's nothing against other gaming podcasters

22:05.260 --> 22:08.780
because there are some people out there putting out incredible shows it's just

22:08.780 --> 22:12.580
that I want to make sure what we do is fresh and stuff so I try to you know

22:12.580 --> 22:17.140
stay away from listening to them a lot plus I still have time but I do try to

22:17.140 --> 22:20.780
catch the occasional one so I was listening to this gamer gamertag radio

22:20.780 --> 22:24.420
and I listened their segment I thought it was pretty interesting and I would

22:24.420 --> 22:29.940
recommend it. My only thing is that I saw it a little more as a social commentary

22:29.940 --> 22:33.980
than necessarily something about games. They do incorporate games into it because

22:33.980 --> 22:40.500
you know the the folks that do this show are other ethnic minorities and they

22:40.500 --> 22:43.800
were kind of talking about that they don't like seeing games like 50 Cent

22:43.800 --> 22:47.660
Bulletproof being representations of the community and kind of being pushed there

22:47.660 --> 22:51.340
but they I mean they kind of talked a whole lot about other stuff too. I thought

22:51.340 --> 22:56.260
is very good pieces very very smart thing so I'd recommend it certainly and

22:56.260 --> 23:03.140
you know there's a lot of minority groups in America and I'm sure feel a

23:03.140 --> 23:07.300
little bit underrepresented or stereotyped by video games sometimes I

23:07.300 --> 23:09.900
thought I thought this is a great piece you know I also thought was really good

23:09.900 --> 23:14.680
about this show this particular show the girl they have on that show is really

23:14.680 --> 23:18.660
good and she didn't say a whole lot during this segment but when I was kind

23:18.660 --> 23:22.760
of surprised because I expected Gamertag Radio to be mostly about Xbox because

23:22.760 --> 23:26.340
you know gamertag but she was the one that brought up Nintendo and she said

23:26.340 --> 23:30.000
you know what that's that's why I like Nintendo because Nintendo they're just

23:30.000 --> 23:33.540
fun they're just they just put out fun games I think you know I tend to agree

23:33.540 --> 23:37.000
is that the games I like the best I think about the two greatest games I

23:37.000 --> 23:42.160
played last year luminous and medios were puzzle games that have nothing to

23:42.160 --> 23:48.160
do with race color religion sexuality stereotypes nothing it's just fun games

23:48.160 --> 23:53.040
and so I the norm for anything out on GameCube I like her a lot you and her

23:53.040 --> 23:56.460
need to get together and do like a girly show because it would be he'll be good

23:56.460 --> 24:02.480
but it would be good it would be good so go check that out it's it's good stuff I

24:02.480 --> 24:06.060
think what it was a gamertagradio.com I think check it out search from on

24:06.060 --> 24:12.320
iTunes alright let's move on here we're gonna go to another topic and Loki well

24:12.320 --> 24:18.140
speaking of some of these games that are an insult to some people 25 to life who

24:18.140 --> 24:21.260
Who hasn't 25 to life insulted?

24:21.260 --> 24:31.840
Well, let's see, well no, 25 to life the national law enforcement officers memorial fund is

24:31.840 --> 24:37.860
calling for a boycott of 25 to life and not because the game sucked and got horrible reviews.

24:37.860 --> 24:43.020
But apparently it's because the game promotes killing of cops and all that stuff yada yada

24:43.020 --> 24:49.140
Basically, they don't like it because the game really has no plot to it and just promotes

24:49.140 --> 24:54.500
killing of cops and killing of gangsters and kill kill kill basic yada yada yada.

24:54.500 --> 24:56.780
Anyways, so that's all you need to know.

24:56.780 --> 25:00.620
It's the same reason why, you know, Jack Thompson gets his paintings and a bunch of A Grand

25:00.620 --> 25:03.460
Theft Auto and all those other games out there.

25:03.460 --> 25:05.940
Is there an actual boycott going to happen?

25:05.940 --> 25:08.460
Not likely, in fact, this will probably push sales up.

25:08.460 --> 25:10.620
So way to go.

25:10.620 --> 25:13.100
I don't I know very little about this game

25:13.100 --> 25:18.140
What do what else do you know about this game 25th of the life is basically revolves around three characters in the game

25:19.260 --> 25:26.380
For some reason there's really hardly any missions to it as far as you know kill 25 cops now kill this kill that you

25:26.380 --> 25:29.240
get the play as either cops or gang bangers and

25:30.380 --> 25:35.580
Throughout the game and they have multiplayer on it as well. It was supposedly one the

25:35.580 --> 25:40.940
the better games coming out in January, all of two that were good that were coming out.

25:40.940 --> 25:46.300
Of course, it ended up getting horrible reviews, I believe, if I remember correctly, IGN gave

25:46.300 --> 25:51.820
it like a 3.9, I think the highest I've seen for it is like a 5 out of 10, I mean, just

25:51.820 --> 25:57.980
really bad, but, because it's, you know, really buggy and stuff, and the graphics suck, and

25:57.980 --> 25:58.980
yada yada yada.

25:58.980 --> 26:04.940
Alright, let's move on to a completely different topic, let's try to get to something not offensive,

26:04.940 --> 26:08.560
25 to life let's talk about 25 in another aspect there's actually this

26:08.560 --> 26:11.800
website I think they do a podcast to what's up with me plugging all the

26:11.800 --> 26:15.680
other podcasts tonight well that's all right support other independent pod we

26:15.680 --> 26:18.600
do we do support other independent podcast there's one of them being too

26:18.600 --> 26:23.600
old to play calm that's the number two too old to play calm a website for

26:23.600 --> 26:28.120
gamers over 25 I thought this was interesting because and and gosh I think

26:28.120 --> 26:32.560
we all fit in that category oh wait sorry Loki you're excluded I am 25 24

26:32.560 --> 26:33.560
No, I'm going for it.

26:33.560 --> 26:34.560
Oh my bad.

26:34.560 --> 26:36.560
All right then, I guess, but it's over 25, so...

26:36.560 --> 26:40.560
Well, technically I am over 25 because I'm 25 in a few more days, so...

26:40.560 --> 26:41.560
All right.

26:41.560 --> 26:42.560
Ha!

26:42.560 --> 26:43.560
All right, whatever.

26:43.560 --> 26:44.560
Fine, then you can be in this elite circle.

26:44.560 --> 26:48.120
They ran a really interesting piece that was huge on dig.com this week and some of the

26:48.120 --> 26:52.960
other sites called The Society of Gaming, and this article starts out, adult gamers

26:52.960 --> 26:55.060
are all the same, right?

26:55.060 --> 26:56.880
Ask any non-gamer and they'll tell you.

26:56.880 --> 26:58.960
We're all a bunch of slackers who never grew up.

26:58.960 --> 27:02.640
This is an excellent tie-in to other controversial stories this week, right?

27:02.640 --> 27:06.320
A bunch of overgrown kids who spend their money on games when there are real ways we

27:06.320 --> 27:10.680
could be spending our money, like on minivans with doors that open by themselves.

27:10.680 --> 27:15.100
So anyway, the story goes on, it says, any community tends to define itself in some way,

27:15.100 --> 27:18.240
so perhaps it's time the gaming community does the same.

27:18.240 --> 27:23.360
Gamers are a diverse group, but most fall into one of six categories.

27:23.360 --> 27:25.800
So I'm going to ask you guys which category you think you fit into.

27:25.800 --> 27:28.240
So here we go, here's the six categories.

27:28.240 --> 27:37.040
Hardcore gamers, the average one they say is not married, but they say that's rare,

27:37.040 --> 27:39.840
it's just a very small group.

27:39.840 --> 27:42.600
They're just essentially hardcore gamers.

27:42.600 --> 27:46.980
They know their games and gaming the way that doctors know the bones of the body.

27:46.980 --> 27:51.380
Hardcore gamers know it all and they're proud of their gaming knowledge.

27:51.380 --> 27:54.000
Let's see, we have devoted gamers.

27:54.000 --> 28:00.400
They have the singular obsession, the one game, whatever it may be, like Halo 2, and

28:00.400 --> 28:05.760
sometimes devoted players kind of move around a little bit.

28:05.760 --> 28:10.360
And then they have the addict, who is a very dark subset they say of the devoted gamer

28:10.360 --> 28:15.000
group, the addict who gets into like one MMORPG and gets addicted to... you know where I'm

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
going with this, right?

28:16.000 --> 28:18.400
You know, because Jamie always used to say, addict, whenever we would talk about Final

28:18.400 --> 28:20.120
Fantasy XI.

28:20.120 --> 28:23.160
The pretend hardcore gamer.

28:23.160 --> 28:28.320
The pretend hardcore gamers, they do really know a thing true about gaming, but they like

28:28.320 --> 28:32.240
to appear that they know far more than they really do.

28:32.240 --> 28:35.200
You know, I think I read a review of this show that actually said something like that

28:35.200 --> 28:36.200
about it.

28:36.200 --> 28:37.200
No, I'm kidding.

28:37.200 --> 28:38.200
I'm kidding.

28:38.200 --> 28:39.200
Anybody that says that's a bastard person.

28:39.200 --> 28:42.880
And then lastly, it would be casual gamers.

28:42.880 --> 28:47.560
A casual gamer is somebody who likes to game, but it's generally one of many hobbies and

28:47.560 --> 28:52.020
is no more important than any of the other ones casual gamers tend to play

28:52.020 --> 28:56.440
only those games that get good reviews and sell a lot of copies and lastly I'm

28:56.440 --> 29:01.240
sorry almost last the clueless gamer clueless gamers buy a lot of games or

29:01.240 --> 29:04.380
they're not really good at any of them and they give up on them before they

29:04.380 --> 29:07.500
become good these are the gamers who do things that puzzle you make a lot of

29:07.500 --> 29:11.180
mistakes and get pretty frustrated by that but also aren't willing to listen

29:11.180 --> 29:15.300
to suggestions or take any time to improve and then lastly the worthless

29:15.300 --> 29:22.460
gamer. Cheaters, hackers, de-levelers, punks, jackasses, all that stuff. The people that

29:22.460 --> 29:27.460
just go in there to ruin games. The worthless gamer. Which gamer are you? Hardcore, devoted,

29:27.460 --> 29:31.780
pretend hardcore, casual, clueless, worthless. Loki.

29:31.780 --> 29:37.980
Hardcore and worthless. Why is this? I just, I have to know my game knowledge just for

29:37.980 --> 29:42.820
working here and you know, I play a lot of games during the week. Not as much as I used

29:42.820 --> 29:48.100
too, but I still play, I always have a game system with me, you know, for the most part.

29:48.100 --> 29:53.020
I mean, I drag a 360 to work every day, and I have a PSP with me. Two game systems that

29:53.020 --> 29:59.460
work with me all the time, you know, that I play every day. And, I mean, I think that's

29:59.460 --> 30:02.980
pretty hardcore right there. And then, of course, I like to cheat in my games sometimes,

30:02.980 --> 30:07.820
because it's fun. It's just a lot of fun. But you don't cheat in MMOs? No, not really.

30:07.820 --> 30:10.780
I don't cheat in MMOs cuz that's too much work. So

30:11.300 --> 30:16.660
All right, Dark Sakura the categories just to give me sure hardcore

30:17.220 --> 30:21.260
Devoted pretend hardcore casual clueless worthless

30:22.420 --> 30:24.900
I'd say hardcore for the old-school stuff

30:25.660 --> 30:28.580
Just because you know my collection, right?

30:29.740 --> 30:31.340
I

30:31.340 --> 30:35.260
Totally can't see hardcore devoted pretend hardcore casual clueless worthless

30:35.260 --> 30:40.460
I'd say I'm pretty devoted to once I get to playing something cuz I like to finish it

30:40.460 --> 30:44.420
I am definitely not I'm not a major cheater. Well, okay

30:44.420 --> 30:49.900
I do cheat my way through Silent Hill 3 just because I'm not really playing it for the gameplay

30:49.900 --> 30:52.340
I'm playing it for the story and the sexy beam and

30:52.980 --> 30:54.980
the heza beam

30:55.100 --> 30:57.100
It's a heza beam

30:57.220 --> 30:58.380
but

30:58.380 --> 31:00.380
that's just

31:00.380 --> 31:06.260
If it's I like putting in cheat codes to see how the game works to see some of the stuff Matt

31:06.260 --> 31:11.300
You know hidden away in it, but I I like a good solid game. I like to get into the gameplay

31:11.580 --> 31:16.120
It's on everything I can about the game. So I'm sort of a nerdy

31:16.820 --> 31:19.120
They need my own category nerd gamer

31:19.580 --> 31:23.500
You sound a little bit like a cross between hardcore and devoted to me a little bit

31:23.500 --> 31:26.380
I would say I'm kind of somewhere between you know

31:26.380 --> 31:30.460
what's weird is that I I think I'm kind of like half devoted half clueless the

31:30.460 --> 31:34.860
only reason I say I'm clueless is because I'm notorious for my gaming a

31:34.860 --> 31:39.180
DD or I will play one game for like a little bit of time and then I go to

31:39.180 --> 31:42.580
something else like I lose interest and I go to something else but when I get

31:42.580 --> 31:46.020
devoted into a game I get really devoted to the game and I'd say I'd see in a way

31:46.020 --> 31:49.700
I just I just don't think I'm to the line where I can really call myself

31:49.700 --> 31:54.380
hardcore I feel that I do know a lot about games and stuff but I just I

31:54.380 --> 31:59.420
Realize that there's a whole world out outside of that too. So I don't know if I can really call myself hardcore

31:59.420 --> 32:03.420
I'm so I'm somewhere between there because I'd say I'm very devoted to a lot of games, too

32:03.420 --> 32:08.180
There's some games that I can never put down but there's other games. I just bounce around a whole awful lot

32:08.180 --> 32:09.140
So I'm somewhere in there

32:09.140 --> 32:13.840
So anyway, if you guys want to read the whole article and figure out which one of those you are too old to play

32:14.500 --> 32:16.500
calm

32:17.100 --> 32:22.420

of you do.

32:53.400 --> 32:55.960
Here come the calls, and we'll start over here.

32:55.960 --> 32:58.720
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

32:58.720 --> 33:00.640
So am I the 100th caller or what?

33:00.640 --> 33:01.840
Are you what?

33:01.840 --> 33:02.960
The 100th caller or what?

33:02.960 --> 33:04.080
Are you the 100th caller?

33:04.080 --> 33:06.000
No, you're the first caller tonight.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
What's on your mind?

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
Damn, it's Ron.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.820
I was hoping I'd get a free toaster out of this.

33:09.820 --> 33:11.320
We might be able to hook you up with that anyway.

33:11.320 --> 33:12.320
I'll bring you a toaster.

33:12.320 --> 33:13.480
I'll bring you a Hello Kitty toaster.

33:13.480 --> 33:15.080
We'll send you a Linux toaster.

33:15.080 --> 33:18.920
When I come out for Katsu-Kan, I'll bring a Hello Kitty toaster.

33:18.920 --> 33:23.400
I'm giving it to my sister at Dark Soccer, I already showed you Linux on a toaster.

33:23.400 --> 33:26.320
I know, I saw it.

33:26.320 --> 33:30.500
First off, I have to ask you, DJ Rama S, what kind of gamer are you?

33:30.500 --> 33:32.600
I'm the casual gamer, okay?

33:32.600 --> 33:35.160
Here's a quick example of the hardcore gamer.

33:35.160 --> 33:38.900
My friend got Kingdom Hearts 2, he beat the game in two weeks.

33:38.900 --> 33:39.900
That's hardcore.

33:39.900 --> 33:40.900
Yes.

33:40.900 --> 33:45.360
addiction but does does your other friend like go outside and and you know

33:45.360 --> 33:50.920
hug a tree once in a while actually no well then maybe he's he's addicted I

33:50.920 --> 33:54.160
don't know all right enough about your friend though what you what made you

33:54.160 --> 33:57.600
want to call in tonight I just want to say what's up how you guys doing and how

33:57.600 --> 34:00.440
much I love to show so far well thank you so much we appreciate the

34:00.440 --> 34:05.400
occasional compliment call it's it's good um we're doing good I'd say I say

34:05.400 --> 34:08.760
I'm doing pretty well we doing a lot of venting tonight which is good oh I heard

34:08.760 --> 34:13.960
As soon as I got home from the jersey, I jumped onto the stream and I heard Doc Soccer foaming

34:13.960 --> 34:17.800
at the mouth about a Doc Soccer president.

34:17.800 --> 34:22.200
What do you think about the whole Flowers for Jack Thompson campaign?

34:22.200 --> 34:26.760
I have better things to do with $20.

34:26.760 --> 34:28.260
Let the little maggot run his mouth.

34:28.260 --> 34:29.260
I don't care.

34:29.260 --> 34:30.480
He's not going to stop me from buying the game.

34:30.480 --> 34:31.480
There you go.

34:31.480 --> 34:33.200
You can put the $20 down towards the game.

34:33.200 --> 34:34.880
That's a very good point.

34:34.880 --> 34:40.080
And if he somehow makes it that a game is not coming out, don't worry, somebody will

34:40.080 --> 34:42.960
find a way and we'll have it.

34:42.960 --> 34:43.960
Very true.

34:43.960 --> 34:44.960
Very true.

34:44.960 --> 34:48.120
Anything else you want to share with our callers tonight, DJ Rama S?

34:48.120 --> 34:53.140
Basically earlier about the whole Jared, Nintendo thing being fat, whatever.

34:53.140 --> 34:56.600
Get up, go outside, and play.

34:56.600 --> 34:59.400
Don't you think they blew his quote a little bit out of context, though?

34:59.400 --> 35:00.400
Do you think you really meant it?

35:00.400 --> 35:01.400
It's the media.

35:01.400 --> 35:02.400
It's the media.

35:02.400 --> 35:03.400
They always blow shit out of proportion.

35:03.400 --> 35:04.400
Well, true.

35:04.400 --> 35:06.400
Yeah, I can agree with you there

35:07.040 --> 35:11.800
All right, I just I just let it go and I just do my thing and it's good. All right, sounds good

35:11.800 --> 35:15.840
Rama Rama, thank you so much for the call. We appreciate it. Okay, you got it. Hey, everybody

35:16.680 --> 35:21.800
All right. Let's go to another call. Hello. You're on orange launch radio. Oh, hey. Hi, who's this?

35:26.360 --> 35:31.800
On the forums, all right, I keep turning down your stream going out

35:31.800 --> 35:42.960
I was calling to ask you guys a question since I know that you guys originally started out

35:42.960 --> 35:49.480
as really a Bimani music games podcast radio thing.

35:49.480 --> 35:53.160
I wanted to ask what are your favorite songs to DDR2?

35:53.160 --> 35:59.160
All right, we'll go ahead and answer that question. We're hearing a little bit of feedback, so I'm going to let you go, but stay tuned.

35:59.160 --> 36:03.160
Favorite songs to DDR2 per Keith? What do you think?

36:03.160 --> 36:05.160
We were hearing a little feedback, so we had to let him go, but...

36:05.160 --> 36:06.160
Holik.

36:06.160 --> 36:07.160
Holik?

36:07.160 --> 36:09.160
Yeah, you know Holik's always my warm-up song.

36:09.160 --> 36:10.160
Yeah, good song.

36:10.160 --> 36:11.160
And Superstar.

36:11.160 --> 36:12.160
Good song. Loki?

36:12.160 --> 36:17.160
I liked, was it, Movin' On by LNG from Fifth Mix, which is pretty cool.

36:17.160 --> 36:22.160
And Rain of Sorrow was pretty cool from Max 2.

36:22.160 --> 36:26.480
My favorite old school song is Oh Nick Please Not So Quick, because you know,

36:26.480 --> 36:30.580
erotic, awesome. Say What You Want, Don't Hate, Don't Hate, that song's awesome.

36:30.580 --> 36:33.920
And my favorite new school song is Skulk by Echo Image

36:33.920 --> 36:38.280
in DDR Ultra Mix 2, because that song is awesome. I love that song. It like totally

36:38.280 --> 36:42.880
breathed new life into DDR. Love it. Let's go to another call, see if we have some luck over here.

36:42.880 --> 36:44.240
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

36:44.240 --> 36:48.960

no we love it we love the poster is so awesome it's hanging here in the studio

37:05.400 --> 37:07.800
it's an in the groove to sign poster it's its hope

37:07.800 --> 37:11.280
if you listen to our old show like the old live show we did

37:11.280 --> 37:13.960
you'll understand why that's hilarious but for now is that go I gotta get to

37:13.960 --> 37:15.320
what I gotta keep a move what what

37:15.320 --> 37:19.360
brings you to call tonight? Well, I got 2DX and all.

37:19.360 --> 37:22.880
I'm just trying to break into it. Any advice? Because I just started

37:22.880 --> 37:26.080
playing that, you know, I think a couple weeks ago

37:26.080 --> 37:29.200
and so far I've pretty much poured out 9 style to

37:29.200 --> 37:33.520
you know, to its prime. When Zaku, now for those who don't know what Zaku's talking

37:33.520 --> 37:36.520
about, 2DX, because we have a lot of people on the podcast who may not have heard of these

37:36.520 --> 37:36.920
games,

37:36.920 --> 37:39.940
2DX is Beat Mania 2DX

37:39.940 --> 37:43.520
and it's actually gonna be released here in the US very soon as Beat Mania. In

37:43.520 --> 37:46.360
In fact, I think the cover art is out there on the internet right now.

37:46.360 --> 37:53.120
But folks have been importing these games from Japan for years now.

37:53.120 --> 37:55.320
There's a whole lot of these games out in Japan.

37:55.320 --> 37:58.940
It started with third style, don't ask, but it started with third style, and all the way

37:58.940 --> 38:04.120
through tenth style now, and supposedly 2DX Red on the way as well, which was eleventh

38:04.120 --> 38:07.080
style for lack of a better term.

38:07.080 --> 38:10.840
The whole lot of these games out there with a hardcore following, and finally we're going

38:10.840 --> 38:13.680
be getting a version of it here in America soon.

38:13.680 --> 38:18.160
As far as getting started with it, I think the best way to learn, I don't think they

38:18.160 --> 38:22.320
still have this in the newer styles, but in 5th style and 6th style they had what was

38:22.320 --> 38:26.400
called a drill mode and it would show you how to do certain key patterns and of course

38:26.400 --> 38:30.680
the game uses a turntable and white and black keys so you play rhythms and make your own

38:30.680 --> 38:35.520
beats and the old 5th and 6th have drill mode which I think is a great way to learn how

38:35.520 --> 38:38.940
to play the game and sometimes it can be really obnoxious because you have to do a lot of

38:38.940 --> 38:42.760
repetition but it's really good it gets you really good at the game yeah I think

38:42.760 --> 38:45.960
I should I think I should have gotten that because you know nice all doesn't

38:45.960 --> 38:49.200
really have that much except for beginner mode the only thing I'm trying

38:49.200 --> 38:53.880
to do right now is trying to do the ranking does night style have the mode

38:53.880 --> 38:57.920
where you can practice the song and slow it down like two guys yeah yeah you

38:57.920 --> 39:00.960
could you have those modes where you can actually practice measures in training

39:00.960 --> 39:04.280
mode that's the best way to do it when there's lack of a drill mode take a song

39:04.280 --> 39:11.320
You can almost pass pass and slow it down in that mode and work at it because most of beat mania is just hearing the

39:11.320 --> 39:14.640
Rhythms in your head and knowing when to hit the keys and that's really the best way to be good at it, right?

39:14.800 --> 39:16.000
All right

39:16.000 --> 39:18.280
Anything else in your mind exactly? We got to keep it moving, but

39:18.840 --> 39:24.800
All right, you know just just saying, you know, just saying what's up and everything. All right, what type of game are you?

39:26.280 --> 39:30.440
Basically, I don't think I call myself casual, but I'm on I'm like up there

39:30.440 --> 39:37.340
Not hardcore not really casual, but in the middle like devoted pretty much have an open mind on you know many games

39:37.340 --> 39:39.340
So would you say you're devoted?

39:39.620 --> 39:44.360
Sort of I mean with DDR. Yes, and with Bahmani also and then you know

39:44.360 --> 39:49.480
I also have my first-person shooters in my in my ROMs. Okay, and all the other internet things

39:49.520 --> 39:56.080
Yeah, you sound devoted to me. You're devoted. I hear I dub you devoted. All right, Zachary. Thanks so much for the call

39:56.080 --> 39:58.380
Take care. Yeah any comment later?

39:58.380 --> 40:03.300
Alright, thank you guys for your calls, we appreciate that, we're going to keep things

40:03.300 --> 40:07.140
moving here on Orange Launch Radio tonight, but of course we appreciate the calls as always.

40:07.140 --> 40:09.780
If we have time later in the show, I don't know if we will tonight, but we'll take more

40:09.780 --> 40:11.900
calls a little later.

40:11.900 --> 40:16.460
Moving on though, we've got other news, starting off with PlayStation 3 news.

40:16.460 --> 40:18.740
Jamie, you have some news on the PlayStation 3?

40:18.740 --> 40:21.820
I do indeed.

40:21.820 --> 40:29.620
there's a it has been predicted that by an analyst by the name of even Wilson

40:29.620 --> 40:34.660
has predicted that the ps3 will launch in November in North America with a

40:34.660 --> 40:42.340
summer launch in Japan followed by a March 2007 European launch so however

40:42.340 --> 40:48.500
this conflicts with what a lot of the analysts over here are saying regarding

40:48.500 --> 40:55.500
when it's going to be out however he's actually gone on this this analyst has

40:55.500 --> 41:00.460
gone on to predict volumes for the system as well he believes that the ps3

41:00.460 --> 41:04.160
will have a million units in Japan in summer with similar volumes in the US

41:04.160 --> 41:10.060
November and again a similar number in for the European market and that they're

41:10.060 --> 41:16.660
basically going to exceed the Xbox 360 all right well we'll see we'll see if it

41:16.660 --> 41:20.660
There's a lot of words going back and forth on it'll be out in November, it won't be out in November,

41:20.660 --> 41:24.660
but most people seem to be looking at November now, which is a good time to release your system right before Christmas.

41:24.660 --> 41:25.660
Right before.

41:25.660 --> 41:30.660
Now, also on the PS3 front, we had some titles get thrown out there earlier this week?

41:30.660 --> 41:35.660
There were some titles put out, and then they were sort of pulled back.

41:35.660 --> 41:36.660
Well, what happened?

41:36.660 --> 41:38.660
Let me, hold on a second.

41:38.660 --> 41:40.660
Sure.

41:40.660 --> 41:53.660
Okay. Basically, the Japanese Playstation site put up a few links to six games they had up on their site, and then took them down without explanation.

41:53.660 --> 42:01.660
So, was it that they said, huh, maybe we shouldn't put them out and just hope they don't notice?

42:01.660 --> 42:14.660
GameIndustry.biz got something out of a Sony spokesperson that said we're working on the launch of the PS3 and confirmed a list of titles that will be announced at the appropriate time.

42:14.660 --> 42:15.660
Hmm.

42:15.660 --> 42:17.660
I guess that wasn't it, was it?

42:17.660 --> 42:20.660
Do you remember what any of those titles were? Sure.

42:20.660 --> 42:34.260
According to one of my sources, there was Genji 2, Angel Rings, Monster Carnival, Everybody's

42:34.260 --> 42:39.260
Goth 5, Gran Turismo, and Eye of Judgment.

42:39.260 --> 42:42.220
Gran Turismo would be a pretty sweet launch title in this country, I know that.

42:42.220 --> 42:47.660
Some we do know of though is Metal Gear Solid 4, there was a demo of a Tekken game, and

42:47.660 --> 42:50.620
There's still speculation regarding the Final Fantasy franchise.

42:50.620 --> 42:52.580
Very interesting.

42:52.580 --> 42:57.100
Also there is in development a version of Unreal Tournament 2007.

42:57.100 --> 42:58.100
Awesome.

42:58.100 --> 43:03.140
I also can confirm this, there was another story that ran on joystick.com earlier this

43:03.140 --> 43:04.140
week.

43:04.140 --> 43:08.360
Virtua Fighter 5 for PlayStation 3 has been confirmed, and it's actually coming from this

43:08.360 --> 43:10.580
month's issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly.

43:10.580 --> 43:16.700
Virtua Fighter 5 is coming to the PS3, and it might be exclusive, and then there's a

43:16.700 --> 43:19.460
sexy little screenshot, but I don't know if that's actually from the game or just something

43:19.460 --> 43:22.420
the site put to kind of tag that with, so.

43:22.420 --> 43:29.420
But certainly fans of Virtua Fighter, of which I know one, and she's in the room, I thought

43:29.420 --> 43:30.420
you liked Virtua Fighter.

43:30.420 --> 43:31.420
I loathe Virtua Fighter.

43:31.420 --> 43:32.420
Oh wow, okay.

43:32.420 --> 43:33.420
Then I don't know anyone who likes Virtua Fighter.

43:33.420 --> 43:34.660
I'm the Tekken fangirl.

43:34.660 --> 43:35.660
I know you liked it.

43:35.660 --> 43:39.220
I thought for some reason you were also, I get the Sega thing.

43:39.220 --> 43:43.760
Virtua Fighter made me gag so much when the first ones were out I was not able to enjoy

43:43.760 --> 43:44.820
the series ever since.

43:44.820 --> 43:48.140
I'll tell you what Virtua Fighter made me made me gag Virtua Fighter 2 on the

43:48.140 --> 43:48.940
Genesis

43:48.940 --> 43:53.940
where they took it and made it 3D. Exactly! Except Virtua Fighter Kids was kinda fun.

43:53.940 --> 43:57.620
Alright, let's talk more PlayStation 3. Loki,

43:57.620 --> 44:01.500
you have some stories about like there was like a survey going on with PlayStation 3?

44:01.500 --> 44:05.580
Yeah, a survey that's been around going around too basically cuz

44:05.580 --> 44:09.860
I don't know if anyone's actually played online with the PlayStation 2.

44:09.860 --> 44:13.620
It's basically a big clusterfuck of what's going on. They don't really have a

44:13.620 --> 44:14.700
system. It just kinda

44:14.700 --> 44:19.300
out there and the original idea for Sony for the PlayStation 3 was

44:19.300 --> 44:22.620
hey it worked before let's go ahead and do it again and

44:22.620 --> 44:25.940
they're kinda looking at that like maybe we should

44:25.940 --> 44:29.420
you know come out with something like Xbox Live anyways so the thing that's going around

44:29.420 --> 44:30.820
right now is there

44:30.820 --> 44:35.980
about 33 questions or so asking different things like for example some

44:35.980 --> 44:37.060
things they hint at

44:37.060 --> 44:40.620
a specific lobby only for adults would that be you know something that you'd be

44:40.620 --> 44:41.300
interested in

44:41.300 --> 44:44.100
with the sexy itoy plugin.

44:44.100 --> 44:50.100
Itoy plugin for game lobbies, USB keyboard support,

44:50.100 --> 44:53.820
just, you know, all the standard stuff that you pretty much see in Xbox Live.

44:53.820 --> 44:57.380
They're asking, hey, you want this? You know, that type of thing.

44:57.380 --> 45:01.780
Which, I mean, begs the question, if they're not going to have

45:01.780 --> 45:05.140
USB keyboard support, then why the hell do they have so many USB ports on the

45:05.140 --> 45:06.500
goddamn thing anyways?

45:06.500 --> 45:10.740
That's what I want to know. So, of course they're going to have USB support

45:10.740 --> 45:15.380
for the, um, you know, keyboard. So that's something that's kinda like going on right

45:15.380 --> 45:17.860
now on friends lists and whatnot.

45:17.860 --> 45:23.100
So, be interesting. Alright now moving on I think this is PlayStation 3 related

45:23.100 --> 45:24.660
something about Pioneer?

45:24.660 --> 45:29.060
Yeah, Pioneer, um, the people making the blu-ray player,

45:29.060 --> 45:33.320
um, they threw out some crazy numbers for what they thought that the PS3 launch

45:33.320 --> 45:34.020
was gonna be

45:34.020 --> 45:38.540
and this I had to laugh. Um, see originally the estimates were, um,

45:38.540 --> 45:43.340
1,000,000 units for launch in the United States while Pioneer is saying that they are going

45:43.340 --> 45:50.140
to have as many as 7,000,000 units available for launch, right?

45:50.140 --> 45:51.440
That's a lot of overtime.

45:51.440 --> 45:52.440
I don't think so.

45:52.440 --> 45:58.220
I mean, let's put it this way, unless they're planning on launching in 2009, it ain't going

45:58.220 --> 45:59.220
to happen.

45:59.220 --> 46:00.220
We'll see.

46:00.220 --> 46:01.220
All right.

46:01.220 --> 46:05.500
Moving on to a completely different topic, but this is somewhat PlayStation related,

46:05.500 --> 46:07.980
but it's also Xbox related.

46:07.980 --> 46:10.140
homebrew for the PSP that's not Tetris?

46:10.140 --> 46:16.760
Yes, this homebrew is actually a port of a PC game which is also a kind of a knock-off

46:16.760 --> 46:18.140
of Geometry Wars.

46:18.140 --> 46:24.940
It's vector and vector for the PSP, very similar to Geometry Wars in the way it plays.

46:24.940 --> 46:30.820
Of course the control scheme is a little bit not as good as the 360 because you don't have

46:30.820 --> 46:35.620
the dual analog on a PSP, but it's really awesome.

46:35.620 --> 46:43.820
It's only available though for the 1.5 firmware, so hopefully you've got that or you can downgrade.

46:43.820 --> 46:47.960
It's available on your various PSP sites like PSPupdates.

46:47.960 --> 46:48.960
Very cool.

46:48.960 --> 46:52.340
So for those folks that can't get your Xbox 360 to play Geometry Wars, maybe this is a

46:52.340 --> 46:53.340
good substitute.

46:53.340 --> 46:58.940
Exactly, and if for whatever reason you can't get a version for the PSP, remember there's

46:58.940 --> 47:05.980
still the PC version of the game which is available at bagfullofwrong.co.uk

47:05.980 --> 47:14.940
slash games slash vector.html. Alright now moving on Loki you had some news on

47:14.940 --> 47:19.580
Majesco something was going on with Majesco and Majesco is getting out of

47:19.580 --> 47:26.320
the hardcore gaming business basically they're not making any more expensive

47:26.320 --> 47:30.440
of games except for the budget titles and portable system games.

47:30.440 --> 47:32.520
What big games did Majesco make?

47:32.520 --> 47:33.880
I can't even think of any off the top of my head.

47:33.880 --> 47:36.640
I think that the last game that they put out was Aeon Flux.

47:36.640 --> 47:39.160
Well that answers a lot.

47:39.160 --> 47:41.840
They've canned a couple of the games already.

47:41.840 --> 47:44.080
What was in progress?

47:44.080 --> 47:45.280
Taxi Driver and Demonic.

47:45.280 --> 47:47.960
Oh that's right, I remember reading the report on Taxi Driver now.

47:47.960 --> 47:51.160
Yeah, they're not doing too well as far as stuff that's coming out.

47:51.160 --> 47:55.920
I know some of their games have been pulled, but it's probably just, they're just looking

47:55.920 --> 48:05.640
you know self-preservation so yeah all right speaking of things gone bad I

48:05.640 --> 48:09.680
thought this was a very interesting story that ran on one up calm it's a

48:09.680 --> 48:13.560
little bit of a throwback to their you know sister company cuz there's if Davis

48:13.560 --> 48:17.480
company and of course if Davis does the electronic gaming monthly magazine and

48:17.480 --> 48:21.400
they're counting down to their 200th issue right now OMG and they ran a

48:21.400 --> 48:29.320
a report on 1UP.com. What were the worst reviewed games ever in Electronic Gaming Monthly?

48:30.040 --> 48:34.600
Oh, Majesco did Psychonauts. Okay, cool. All right, Electronic Gaming Monthly,

48:35.480 --> 48:41.320
the worst 10, not the top 10, but the worst 10 games ever reviewed. Batman Beyond, number 10,

48:41.320 --> 48:47.640
for the PS1. Who wants to beat up a millionaire on the Dreamcast? That was hilarious. That game

48:47.640 --> 48:53.360
was fun got a 1.0 score powerpuff girls paint the townsville green for the game

48:53.360 --> 48:58.080
boy color and then right behind that at number seven powerpuff girls bad mojo

48:58.080 --> 49:04.400
Jojo also for the game boy color it was also in the same issue kiss pinball for

49:04.400 --> 49:08.760
the PlayStation one was number six remember that the psycho circus game

49:08.760 --> 49:15.520
yeah urban champion II which was for the game boy advance for some reason for

49:15.520 --> 49:18.720
For some reason, I think they re-released this on the Advance, it was one of their games they put on the Advance.

49:18.720 --> 49:21.720
Urban Champion, that game sucked balls on Nintendo.

49:21.720 --> 49:24.520
It's like Nintendo's little blemish of the 8-bit era.

49:24.520 --> 49:27.120
I mean, who remembers Urban Champion?

49:27.120 --> 49:29.520
I mean, like, Hogan's Alley, awesome.

49:29.520 --> 49:34.320
Other games, other 8-bit classics made by Nintendo that were forgotten about like that were awesome.

49:34.320 --> 49:36.620
But Urban Champion, easy forgotten.

49:36.620 --> 49:39.120
Number four, The Guy Game.

49:39.120 --> 49:40.420
It wasn't that bad.

49:40.420 --> 49:41.420
Rebuttal.

49:41.420 --> 49:48.200
It was a good trivia game in which you look past all the like really crappy, yeah, topless

49:48.200 --> 49:52.220
stuff and, granted, you had to memorize questions, but they did have a mode that like randomized

49:52.220 --> 49:54.660
stuff and it wasn't so bad.

49:54.660 --> 49:58.660
Number three, Mortal Kombat Advance for the Game Boy Advance.

49:58.660 --> 50:01.300
It was pretty poopy.

50:01.300 --> 50:07.300
Number two, the number two worst game of all time, according to an EGM list here on 1UP.com.

50:07.300 --> 50:10.100
The Flintstones Bedrock Bowling.

50:10.100 --> 50:16.140
a reason why I never heard of that game apparently. Here's the number one worst game of all time

50:16.140 --> 50:21.980
reviewed on EGM, and it's a game I own, because it was a gift. Ping Pals, for the Gameplay

50:21.980 --> 50:27.740
DS, or for the Nintendo DS, was the worst reviewed game of all time. And rightfully

50:27.740 --> 50:30.940
so, in many ways, because Ping Pals kind of sucks. Loki, you're shaking your head.

50:30.940 --> 50:35.900
No, I think there's a worse game out there, and this is basically the Manos, the Hands

50:35.900 --> 50:41.560
of fate for PC games. It's called Big Rigs. If you go to GameSpot.com and look for the

50:41.560 --> 50:45.480
review on Big Rigs, the game came out...

50:45.480 --> 50:47.320
Now this is not the same as Big Mother Truckers.

50:47.320 --> 50:54.320
No, this isn't the same as Big Mother Truckers. It's a Big Rig racing game and the AI doesn't

50:55.160 --> 51:01.080
move. The other cars don't move, so it's impossible for you to lose a race. The physics aren't

51:01.080 --> 51:05.880
there. You fall through bridges. You can drive off the map. There is no limit to your acceleration.

51:05.880 --> 51:11.600
So you can hold down and go a million miles an hour and then hold the acceleration down.

51:11.600 --> 51:12.600
It's just an awful game.

51:12.600 --> 51:13.600
There's not many maps.

51:13.600 --> 51:17.280
It doesn't really work and crashes all the way through it.

51:17.280 --> 51:18.360
Just watch the review.

51:18.360 --> 51:19.680
It's hilarious.

51:19.680 --> 51:20.920
It's one of the worst games of all time.

51:20.920 --> 51:23.160
I think it's gotten like a zero.

51:23.160 --> 51:24.920
I mean it's so awful.

51:24.920 --> 51:28.360
I was going to go around and ask what do you think were things that they missed on this

51:28.360 --> 51:29.360
list.

51:29.360 --> 51:32.960
I was going to say Sprung for the DS which is a game I reviewed on the show half a year

51:32.960 --> 51:34.080
ago probably now at this point.

51:34.080 --> 51:35.080
That game was so awful.

51:35.080 --> 51:37.760
It was so awful, it wasn't even like a game.

51:37.760 --> 51:40.720
Sprung definitely deserves to be in the bottom ten here.

51:40.720 --> 51:42.600
Dark Soccer, any come to mind for you?

51:42.600 --> 51:48.160
I haven't really played anything crappy because usually I get my opportunity to, I read up

51:48.160 --> 51:52.240
on it before I get it anyway.

51:52.240 --> 51:54.800
I don't think I've played any crap this year.

51:54.800 --> 51:59.880
Was there a game that you didn't like that a lot of other people liked?

51:59.880 --> 52:02.000
There were games I thought were overrated.

52:02.000 --> 52:07.600
I mean certainly, I like Ridge Racer a whole bunch, but I thought Ridge Racer 6 was kind

52:07.600 --> 52:10.780
of overrated.

52:10.780 --> 52:15.040
I can't say that there's any that I really dislike that I actually played, put effort

52:15.040 --> 52:16.040
into.

52:16.040 --> 52:17.040
Fair enough, fair enough.

52:17.040 --> 52:18.040
Alright.

52:18.040 --> 52:22.580
Oh yeah, Smackdown vs. Raw on the PSP because that game annoys the hell out of me.

52:22.580 --> 52:28.080
Some comments from the chat room, some folks there are putting in their own two cents here.

52:28.080 --> 52:33.440
funny dale says worst game of all time back to the future for the NES

52:33.440 --> 52:35.440
back to the future two and three

52:35.440 --> 52:37.240
E.T. on the twenty six hundred

52:37.240 --> 52:42.240
I actually played E.T. on the twenty six hundred when I was like six years old and found it entertaining

52:42.240 --> 52:45.680
but of course I was six years old so you know and the Smurfs on Gleeke's Vision

52:45.680 --> 52:47.440
the Smurfs was badass

52:47.440 --> 52:51.680
Hey I love the Smurfs game I played that all the time when I was like four

52:51.680 --> 52:54.740
uh... MagMax on the NES

52:54.740 --> 52:57.040
how about Night Trap

52:57.040 --> 53:03.920
What's her face? Yeah, I know and she's dead now. Let's see. Um, Raj says Barney's hide-and-seek for the Sega Genesis

53:04.120 --> 53:08.600
I got one ice world. I got our spice world's awesome

53:09.120 --> 53:10.720
non-stop

53:10.720 --> 53:13.760
Street fighter to the movie the game. Oh

53:14.360 --> 53:16.520
That takes the cake there. Let's see. Um

53:17.360 --> 53:19.360
Ra says but but Shaq foo

53:19.880 --> 53:25.120
That's a very good one. Nint says universal combat was mixed missed on the list there

53:25.120 --> 53:29.560
lots and lots of good stuff there oh I know I know one that I cannot stand I

53:29.560 --> 53:32.240
hate this game I think it's the worst game I've ever played it's worse than

53:32.240 --> 53:37.080
sprung what pit fighter ah I think was like an Atari game that came out years

53:37.080 --> 53:43.080
ago oh my god it's awful it was like they use like live capture stuff it's

53:43.080 --> 53:48.120
awful carnival I never played it is a shooting game where you go through like

53:48.120 --> 53:52.060
an evil twisted carnival and it was kind of stupid horrible or time killers

53:52.060 --> 53:57.040
horrible horrible all right moving on I know a lot of folks there in chat room

53:57.040 --> 54:00.580
getting in on that but we need to move on here and we're gonna go over to Loki

54:00.580 --> 54:06.200
who's got a story some good some good final stories for us tonight you know I

54:06.200 --> 54:09.100
know a lot of you people out there want to learn Japanese and you think you can

54:09.100 --> 54:11.960
just sign up for a Japanese class and you know you'll learn it like that it's

54:11.960 --> 54:18.480
it's easy stuff right right our Sakura Japanese language is cake I'm just

54:18.480 --> 54:22.480
Well, here's a way you can learn Japanese the fun way, right, Loki?

54:22.480 --> 54:24.440
What's the fun way to learn Japanese?

54:24.440 --> 54:27.520
This is learn Japanese with knuckles.

54:27.520 --> 54:28.880
Knuckles from the Sonic franchise, of course.

54:28.880 --> 54:30.560
Oh, you mean the knuckles on my hand?

54:30.560 --> 54:33.040
Like if you get the question wrong, pow, I hit you.

54:33.040 --> 54:34.920
No, as in Sonic and Knuckles.

54:34.920 --> 54:40.400
Anyways, they have this homemade RPG called Knuckles in China Land, which I don't understand

54:40.400 --> 54:43.640
why it's China Land if you're learning Japanese, but whatever.

54:43.640 --> 54:59.640
Basically you can learn, they have all of the hiragana and katakana symbols in there as well as 6000 kanji and you can actually learn using this game.

54:59.640 --> 55:07.640
And you can find it at www.kicl.info

55:07.640 --> 55:11.640
And it's a free download of course and go check it out. Awesome.

55:11.640 --> 55:18.140
Um, the other things, let's see here, wait I just have to say Super Pitfall for the NES.

55:18.140 --> 55:23.000
Tarnish the Pitfall name, that game is garbage, absolute garbage.

55:23.000 --> 55:27.280
I got it as a present from like a family member who didn't know much about games, it was garbage.

55:27.280 --> 55:32.640
How about the Sega CD version of Dragon's Lair, that was missing scenes?

55:32.640 --> 55:36.240
How about anything on the 3DO?

55:36.240 --> 55:37.240
The Zelda game?

55:37.240 --> 55:38.240
That wasn't a Zelda game?

55:38.240 --> 55:39.240
Like anything on the 3DO.

55:39.240 --> 55:42.240
Actually, didn't 3DO have the racing game? Well, forget it.

55:42.240 --> 55:51.240
And the sitting thing on the Jaguar with the exception of Tempest 2000, well is it Tempest X, and Defender 2000.

55:51.240 --> 55:54.240
Alright, okay, what else? A couple more things real quick.

55:54.240 --> 55:56.240
Sure.

55:56.240 --> 55:59.240
This is just hitting the web right now.

55:59.240 --> 56:03.240
Multi-Theft Auto San Andreas 1.0 has finally been released.

56:03.240 --> 56:08.240
The PC version of Grand Theft Auto that they've modded to allow multiplayer games in,

56:08.240 --> 56:11.240
which I think they should have done from the start.

56:11.240 --> 56:18.640
It's available right now if you go to lite.mtavc.com

56:18.640 --> 56:23.640
MTA as in you know multitheftautovicecity.com

56:23.640 --> 56:25.640
You can check it out.

56:25.640 --> 56:27.640
Looks like it's going to be pretty good.

56:27.640 --> 56:31.640
Lots of mirror servers right now because it's being hammered to death but

56:31.640 --> 56:35.640
if it's anything like multitheftautovicecity it's going to be amazing.

56:35.640 --> 56:39.720
So yeah, one last thing of course we've got

56:39.720 --> 56:42.780
it's, and we mentioned this before, it's

56:42.780 --> 56:47.800
eBay for Animal Crossing. Yes, all those people out there that

56:47.800 --> 56:53.160
just really want that rare stuff that you can't find. I gotta have the

56:53.160 --> 56:53.880
Metroid.

56:53.880 --> 56:57.480
I must have the Metroid. Exactly.

56:57.480 --> 57:03.040
Then your answer is nookbay.com. Check it out. You can actually bid on items

57:03.040 --> 57:07.760

57:18.200 --> 57:19.200
Nookbay.com.

57:19.200 --> 57:20.200
So, it's amazing.

57:20.200 --> 57:21.200
All right.

57:21.200 --> 57:25.080
Well, we're about ready to wrap up the show here, but I have to respond to a chatter real

57:25.080 --> 57:27.640
quick because, you know, we do have this interactive thing going on.

57:27.640 --> 57:31.000
Funnydale says in the chat room here, I got news for you, Sky.

57:31.000 --> 57:34.240
pitfall games that came out after the first one have tarnished the name of

57:34.240 --> 57:39.760
pitfall no no no no pitfall to the Mayan caverns on Atari 2600 one of the

57:39.760 --> 57:43.960
only Atari 2600 games to feature background music that game was badass I

57:43.960 --> 57:48.240
enjoy it more than the first one but the first one is a legendary game I do love

57:48.240 --> 57:52.040
that game a lot so I have to disagree with you there but maybe you just forgot

57:52.040 --> 57:55.440
so I'll let it slide but yeah a lot of the other ones that came out after that

57:55.440 --> 58:00.400
were garbage but we'll see anyway that's all I have to say Loki any last-minute

58:00.400 --> 58:03.400
I know you're ruffling through the pages of the internet right now.

58:03.400 --> 58:06.400
Yeah, well, just a little fun little thing here.

58:06.400 --> 58:07.400
Okay.

58:07.400 --> 58:12.400
They have, everybody loves, you know, the prints from Katamari,

58:12.400 --> 58:16.400
and now you can make your very own prints to put on your desktop at work.

58:16.400 --> 58:21.400
They have a paper model actually you can download and print out and make.

58:21.400 --> 58:28.400
make. It's at fccafe.fc2web.com

58:28.460 --> 58:32.040
slash p-t-a-m-a-c-y

58:32.040 --> 58:35.240
.html and go check it out

58:35.240 --> 58:38.880
and they've got your own little prints for you.

58:38.880 --> 58:42.080
Cute. Alright, it's time to wrap it up.

58:42.080 --> 58:45.760
I think we've had ourselves a good show tonight and I think it's time to end it. So now it's time to get our

58:45.760 --> 58:46.560
final thoughts.

58:46.560 --> 58:50.280

58:50.280 --> 58:53.900

59:21.300 --> 59:24.880
some pitfall 2 very soon because I thought about that game just now with

59:24.880 --> 59:27.980
this show and it was so awesome dark soccer and that's another one of those

59:27.980 --> 59:30.780
