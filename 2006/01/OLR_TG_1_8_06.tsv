189	2570	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of January 9th, 2006.
2870	13215	You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
13475	16997	Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
18157	21899	Hello everybody once again, and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.
21979	25621	It's that podcast dedicated to what gamers really want to know about.
25701	28622	We here at Orange Lounge like to talk about games that don't suck...
29417	33160	But sometimes, you know, we'll tell you about a couple that do suck just to tell you to stay the hell away.
33580	34561	My name is Rob Roberts.
34581	35562	You might know me as Sky.
35582	37143	My awesome co-hosts are here.
37463	39264	Say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
39605	40305	Hello.
40325	41026	How are you doing?
42106	42527	Okay.
42827	43067	Yeah?
43848	44068	Yeah.
44128	45109	Well, good.
45629	49472	Now, before when we were taping our live show earlier this evening, you were a little sickly, but you're feeling better now.
49672	51473	It was that horrible Chinese food.
51493	53835	I don't think that my body can process that type of stuff anymore.
54075	58899	We went to this horrible Chinese buffet for dinner tonight, and it was cheap, but the food, you know, it's just...
59754	62857	It's the grossest of the gross Chinese food, but, you know, oh well.
63617	64558	It wasn't even that filling.
65599	66179	Anyway, Loki.
66960	67960	Suddenly we're the Food Network.
68200	70622	Loki is over there in that corner, the other co-host.
70642	71003	How you doing?
71843	81510	Hopefully good because that, speaking of the Chinese food place, the beef that was for the Mongolian barbecue type stuff wasn't frozen.
81570	83572	It was quite raw and sitting there out in the open.
83612	87294	That seems like a health code violation to me, but okay.
87315	87455	Okay.
88555	90437	So if I'm dead tomorrow, then we'll know why.
113087	117552	And since it's going to be two hours in length, that means you guys are going to get two podcasts throughout the week.
117912	120515	So Twice the Orange Lounge Radio coming to the podcast stream.
120755	122016	That all starts next week.
122477	124398	Next week's show as well, Freeze Pop.
124559	125640	We're going to have them on the show.
125940	126821	It's going to be awesome.
126881	127822	It's going to be a great interview.
127842	130945	We're really excited to have Freeze Pop, a very well-known band.
130965	134328	If you guys have played Guitar Hero, Amplitude Frequency, it's going to be awesome.
134749	136711	We have one of them coming on, so it's going to be great.
137295	139417	DarkSakura, What's Going On In Your Gaming Week?
162959	164080	To enrich your mind once in a while.
164280	165741	You ever play text adventure games?
166041	166542	Like Zork?
166562	166962	You remember those?
167182	168343	Oh, I used to play Gemstone 3.
168383	169704	Oh, okay.
169804	170545	I never played that one.
170605	172146	Back when I was a geek on AOL.
172426	174368	What about like the middle range?
174388	179051	Like when text games kind of evolved into graphical games and what adventure games are today?
179071	180132	Like King's Quest, Space Quest?
180212	183335	I played King's Quest 4 a little bit, but I just couldn't get into that.
183955	184296	Oh, God.
184336	185797	King's Quest 4 was my favorite.
187118	191441	Actually, I played Loom, but Loom was more sort of a combination.
191481	194663	Yeah, there wasn't so much text at that point, but yeah, that's cool.
195683	197284	So, Loki, how was your gaming week?
197685	199025	It was pretty good.
199086	200827	I've been trying to play a lot more on the 360.
202107	213174	Of course, I've been playing my normal games, Animal Crossing DS every day, and then I've been playing, what else, Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, which I'm very excited to hear that they're
213513	215514	Coming out with a PS2 version of that game.
216034	219715	And a new PSP version of Grand Theft Auto at some point this year.
221056	223156	Then, of course, I got to try a few things on the 360.
223917	227038	First off, I've been playing Call of Duty 2, the single player mode in that.
227578	228498	And that game's amazing.
228578	229818	It's just really awesome.
230879	240162	It does though, I'm playing on the easiest difficulty because I'm not very good at these military first person shooters that involve actual realistic damage to your character and stuff like that.
240766	241066	and so on.
265885	266446	Fight Night Round 3
282304	283425	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
304601	308162	Other than that, I did play a little bit of online multiplayer for Call of Duty 2.
309022	313803	It's okay, but do not bring up the guide when you're playing the game online.
313823	317744	I accidentally hit the button trying to hit pause to change my weapon on it.
318564	321885	And my game started glitching out like crazy after that.
322045	323865	So that's something they gotta fix.
324805	327946	And the other thing was the server was full this morning so I couldn't play online.
328306	329086	That kind of sucked.
329906	333207	And I haven't figured out a way to get my friends to play the same game with me.
333227	333447	And that
333829	334750	Also, it's frustrating.
334770	336711	It's a lot of frustrating stuff with Xbox Live.
338153	339914	Well, on the regular Xbox, it's just fine.
339954	342496	I don't know what your problems are, but it's all new.
342957	343177	Yeah.
344218	346780	Well, also, you're kind of a new Xbox user, so maybe there's stuff you're missing.
346800	346940	Exactly.
346960	347941	I don't know what the hell I'm doing.
347961	362633	A lot of times, I've got my... The only other person I have that's actually playing with me is one of my customers, because I do game sales at work, and one of my customers got 360, so I've been talking with him, voice chatting stuff, which doesn't work well, because they use headphones at the same time, too, so...
363109	364050	Thanks for watching!
387327	391528	All right, my gaming week, I didn't play a whole lot of new stuff.
391808	397029	I went out and I got Amplitude for $10 because I had borrowed that game from another friend of mine for like a year.
397629	401130	And finally, I just had to buy my own dang copy, which is great.
401470	402751	And it's a great game.
402791	404991	It's one of the most underrated PS2 games of all time.
405191	408832	That's another reason why I'm excited Freeze Pop's going to be here next week because they contributed to that game.
410192	413013	Also, I picked out a copy of Burnout.
413693	415514	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
438885	440187	and why did I call it Xbox 1.5?
440447	441408	I have no idea.
441708	446173	Oh, because I have the Halo thing, so sometimes I joke that it's not really the first Xbox.
446213	447014	It's like the 1.5.
447555	448776	Anyway, that's what some people call the 360.
449017	451860	It's a fun game.
451900	452280	I like it.
452300	453762	I like making car wrecks.
453942	457006	I have actually been having trouble with Xbox Live on that game as well, though.
457446	458367	So it's kind of interesting.
458707	461990	Although, I know I'd get my ass kicked if I tried to play a lot online, so I don't really.
462670	465652	I need an actual steering wheel to really get the feel for that game.
465852	467434	The controller is not the same to me.
467494	469095	I can't drive with a controller on that game.
470154	497854	but otherwise it's been the same old stuff not a whole lot of new stuff I've been playing a lot of Animal Crossing and Partners in Time which I talked about a couple weeks ago on the show Mario and Luigi for DS well what's ironic is I'll be quitting Final Fantasy XI at some point here I haven't really set a date yet when I'm going to cancel my account but I'm also going to be participating in the beta for Final Fantasy XI on the 360 that's why I want to get my Xbox 360 I want in on that beta
500276	501277	You know what?
501317	502377	It's going to be pretty in HD.
502397	503718	It's going to be so pretty.
503978	504758	I'll bring it over.
505358	506239	That's not good enough.
506279	506899	I want to play.
506919	508160	I want to start from the beginning.
508220	509600	I'm glad I quit that game.
509660	511181	You can kiss my booty.
511961	512462	That's okay.
512482	513082	I don't know where it's been.
514304	514785	Anyway.
515406	517568	So, well, that kind of leads us into a news item here.
517608	520311	We got the Final Fantasy XI demo is coming to the U.S.
520331	521272	Can't you sign up for it now?
521773	527139	Yeah, they have the sign-ups for it right now to get your content ID numbers, basically, you know, the registration codes that you need.
527159	528080	Are they going to close it?
528120	529782	Should I go and sign up even though I don't have an account?
529822	530964	You probably should.
531124	531825	Okay, I will.
531865	534107	So go sign up right now if you haven't yet.
534929	537991	The demo CD, I'm not sure the other ways to get it.
538071	542113	I do know that it's going to be in the official Xbox Magazine, the February issue.
542634	547717	They're going to have that, but I think there's other ways to get it if you're not subscribed or don't want to buy it.
547877	549498	Have they talked about the limitations of the beta?
549518	551079	Because obviously it can't be the full game.
551519	554501	It's the full game, just not the new patch.
555123	556344	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
576889	577490	Thanks for watching!
595600	595860	DarkSakura
612861	613502	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
629535	632337	Namco Bondi Holdings USA Inc.
633798	644666	owns Bondi Namco Group US subsidiaries including Bondi America, Bondi Entertainment, Namco America Inc., Namco Cybertape Inc.
644706	649130	being the arcades, and Namco Networks America Inc.
649430	653293	that's the mobile game unit, and Namco Bondi Games America for the video games.
653493	654034	Thanks for watching!
664560	665241	I guess so.
665461	666762	Be interesting.
667023	670827	One day they're all going to be bought by one of the folks, or they'll put out their own consoles.
671668	671968	Who knows?
672128	672468	Who knows?
673109	673389	All right.
674731	677654	Loki, you have some news from the Consumer Electronics Show, right?
677694	678535	What was going on now?
678615	680217	I heard about some new attachment for the 360.
680257	681518	It's going to be pretty big.
681598	682719	Well, there's a lot of stuff going on.
683060	684681	Obviously, they're showing off the new...
685934	688976	Video Technologies, both HD DVD and Blu-ray.
689317	697282	And of course, you know, Sony being behind Blu-ray, then that means, you know, the Microsoft has the back, or the HD DVD.
697983	705328	And so they're actually going to be selling an add-on unit for the Xbox 360 for HD DVD.
705368	706849	It's going to be HD DVD Drive.
707850	712173	The only catch is, it's only for HD DVD movies, not games.
712513	714615	So unless you're thinking, oh, hey, you know,
715347	717708	More storage space for these upcoming games.
717728	719648	I think, again, that's not going to happen.
719768	725810	No, it's that same issue that Xbox 360s didn't come default packed in with the hard drive.
725890	728911	So now not every game can support the hard drive because not everybody has one.
729431	730371	Same thing with the HD DVD.
730411	731692	I still think, though, that they can.
731952	735353	They just make it so that you have to have the hard drive when you buy it.
735373	735873	It's risky.
735973	738074	I mean, Final Fantasy XI is going to have to do it, but it's still risky.
738454	738614	Yeah.
740307	740607	I don't know.
740807	742749	That's one of the things that they've got so far.
742809	747031	I think it's stupid because if I'm going to get an HD DVD player, I'll just get a standalone player.
747091	749793	Why do I need an add-on for the 360?
750814	752755	Which is probably going to be overpriced, like the hard drive.
753311	754112	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
780816	781876	Thanks for watching!
804426	807949	All right, so what about some of the games that were over at Consumer Electronics Show, Logan?
808269	816796	One of the things that they were showing off, actually, in the Dolby Digital booth was Burnout Revenge for the 360, and wow, does it look sexy.
817556	819218	So they actually had a few screenshots.
819278	820198	It was playable, though.
820739	823481	They said that they've added... It's basically built from the ground up.
824061	830947	They've got more detailed models to actually show damage to the cars and stuff, as well as they've added 10 crash junctions...
831451	839695	It's basically going to be just a really nice, pretty-looking version of Burnout Revenge, hopefully with some better single-player mode stuff in there, like Burnout 3.
839835	843857	But, yeah, basically expect it to be really awesome.
843917	845358	It is going to be coming out in March.
846558	846838	Awesome.
847198	851160	One other thing I know they announced at the Consumer Electronics Show, some expansions coming to Xbox Arcade?
851741	852541	Yeah, definitely.
853321	856523	With Xbox Live, the arcade is just awesome to begin with.
856903	861205	And this, of course, being one of the hugest games in the arcade scene, Street Fighter...
862343	865504	is coming to the arcade, and they're doing some pretty cool stuff with it.
867025	873727	Like, for example, they've got this kind of coin-up mode, which is... I heard about this, the quarter mode, it's called.
873827	874528	I heard about this.
874568	875388	This is pretty crazy.
875628	881610	Exactly, and it's kind of basically this new thing created for Xbox Live Arcade.
882251	891334	You can actually do a spectator-based system where you get to watch people play and stuff like that, and you can buy into player matches and stuff.
892258	898565	They've got... Basically, the quarters are used to represent players and pays homage to the arcade type thing.
898626	902731	Voice chat, which is kind of cool because it'll bring back the trash talking from the arcade.
902871	904293	Oh, just what we need on Xbox Live.
904353	905514	More trash talking.
905574	905995	Thank you.
906355	907797	And then they also have...
909404	912045	Gaming Lobby to watch the brawls and stuff like that.
912365	915905	You can do an opti-match, which is good player matching stuff.
915965	922166	Training mode, of course, CPU battles, arcade mode, which is kind of like the arcade type thing.
922807	930948	They have best characters, rankings on which characters are the most popular, monthly rankings, and just a whole new thing.
931388	933028	For a game that's over 10 years old.
933248	936109	Exactly, and 5.1 surround sound, which is
936755	937415	I guess kind of neat.
937435	940316	I don't know what they'd be doing with it, but I don't know.
940856	944858	Personally, I think this is one of the best things coming to the Xbox Live Arcade.
945138	947298	I'm not a huge fighting fan, but it's awesome.
947518	949939	And this is Smash TV was great to begin with.
949979	950579	Oh, exactly.
951000	957242	And I'm hoping that more of this stuff comes to the arcade, and they're talking about maybe one of the rumors was Ninja Turtles arcade games.
957302	959882	So let's get some actual meme stuff on here.
959902	961063	That would be fucking awesome.
961843	964504	I think I would personally be happiest if we got Turtles in Time.
965923	975569	either of the Turtles games or I'm thinking the X-Men game remember that X-Men thing was huge it was like six players I was all over that machine with two screens
976616	977936	Hell yeah, that was an awesome game.
977956	978596	That would be fun to have.
978837	979817	See, you could do that on HDTV.
979837	980797	It would be fun.
981217	981497	Alright.
982677	988079	Here's something else coming out of Consumer Electronics Show, and I love this because I grew up on the Commodore 64.
989439	990239	Well, get this.
990939	997721	Commodore International Corporation now owns this brand, and they're going to be releasing something called the Commodore Combo.
998221	1004602	It's going to have five games included and another 90 approximately available for download online.
1004922	1008483	A 20 gigabyte hard drive running Windows CE.
1008983	1016765	So, Commodore's coming back in this like handheld thing and I'm assuming that maybe some of the great Commodore 64 classics will be coming to this system.
1017125	1023186	Probably not great Giana Sisters, but maybe we would have some of the other great Commodore 64 games.
1023947	1025847	Oh man, the Commodore 64 was such an awesome system.
1026127	1030030	Like, a lot of games that were on Atari 2600 were on the Commodore 64 as well, but better.
1030471	1033113	Like, H-E-R-O, I think of off the top of my head.
1033133	1039899	Just, oh man, I just, I grew up, like, that was my gaming system when I grew up was Commodore 64, so I'm excited about this.
1040239	1040499	Cool.
1040799	1041820	I want to see Jumpman Jr.
1041840	1042841	I want to take that on handheld.
1043001	1043702	I love Jumpman.
1043722	1044042	Awesome.
1044562	1045703	Jumpman, Jumpman Jr., whatever.
1045803	1049186	How about, I want my Impossible Mission on the go, so I can get that.
1051128	1051168	Uh...
1053047	1054468	This would have to do with...
1079358	1083641	A game called Odama coming out for the GameCube.
1084241	1088864	Actually, it's a nod to Yu Saito who bought us Seaman.
1090324	1092866	Who remembers talking to your fish on the Dreamcast?
1094167	1094507	Marmar.
1095294	1096495	I never played that game.
1096515	1097376	I played Seaman.
1097556	1101460	Oh, actually, more specifically, Dan played Seaman and I would ask him foul questions.
1101700	1103241	No, I thought Seaman was coming back.
1103581	1106344	I thought that they were going to remake that or something.
1106364	1108406	So, Jamie, are you saying you enjoy playing with Seaman?
1108666	1110047	I'm going to hate you.
1110728	1111929	Okay.
1113750	1120096	But basically, you know, Nintendo was really slow to sort of take on to the idea that
1120760	1131014	But the premise behind it is that it's a military pinball game set in feudal Japan, where you knock down barriers, run over enemies, use a microphone to issue vocal commands.
1132255	1134118	It seems kind of odd to me.
1134258	1136401	I would rather have another Seaman, but, you know...
1137341	1142546	I also think that there's a neat little mention here that Miyamoto's favorite game of all time is Pac-Man.
1142586	1142666	Yep.
1142706	1143026	Interesting.
1163503	1177626	Speaking of the DS, well, that's not really a DS, but speaking of Nintendo and something that's going to be happening with the DS, Contact is a new game currently in development, and it is actually being produced by the same director who produced Capcom's Killer7.
1178166	1183607	It's about a boy named Cherry who's tasked with helping a nutty professor find all the lost components of his spaceship.
1183627	1184367	But here's the thing.
1184847	1186647	It's not just any regular RPG.
1186687	1189008	They're saying it's going to use the Wi-Fi service.
1189828	1190168	So...
1191104	1191684	Ragnarok Online
1215422	1216563	Ragnarok Online on the DS
1241212	1242854	DarkSakura, what's going on with Sony's future for the PSP
1261295	1266921	Well, there's coming up a location-free TV service coming up.
1267381	1274028	What it will do is it will connect with PC, TV, and PSP, allowing access, streamed audio, visual.
1274849	1276731	You can watch broadcasts over the Internet.
1277832	1281376	Using this built-in player, you'd be able to do it from anywhere with a Wi-Fi hotspot.
1282873	1291817	Also coming out is a new version of the PSP Media Manager so that it will make the transferring, converting all those files a lot simpler.
1292117	1297239	I know that that will cause some issues with people because it goes to WebMP4 format.
1298500	1306003	Also they're going to relaunch their iTunes Like Connect to Music download service in March so that you can download game content.
1308435	1312497	Actually, with the version 2.5 firmware that came out a few months back.
1312517	1314039	Aren't they on 2.6 now, though?
1314099	1314959	They are on 2.6.
1315480	1319803	With 2.5 came the location-free player ability.
1319923	1326467	Now with the PSP, the only problem is the location-free player hardware part that you need on your PC or your TV.
1327168	1327428	It's about $300.
1327468	1327588	Ouch.
1327608	1327688	Ouch.
1330981	1331301	Beggar Prince
1360302	1366426	There has not been a new Sega Genesis game in America since 1998, but now there's going to be a brand new game.
1366487	1367507	It's called Beggar Prince.
1367928	1370529	Essentially, it's a little bit of a role-playing game.
1370970	1375313	It's about a prince who gets out of the castle but is disguised as a beggar.
1375393	1376154	Now, here's the thing, though.
1376874	1384360	It was actually released originally in Taiwan in 1996, so they've actually just translated this to...
1385100	1386161	That's what they cost me though.
1403652	1407594	Yeah, well, I mean, but that was, you know, the technology is so far ahead.
1407674	1414538	I could get a PlayStation 2 game or a, you know, Xbox game for 46 bucks, but I don't know.
1414598	1416219	I suppose it really doesn't matter.
1416659	1418540	It just depends on how good is the game.
1418660	1419421	Is the game fun?
1419901	1420581	So we'll find out.
1422182	1427065	So apparently it's got great graphics, though, and there's a really interesting innovative combat system.
1427125	1431828	So if we manage to get a hold of this game, we'll let you know how it is and follow up on it a little bit later.
1432830	1433230	DarkSakura
1445580	1449464	We'd have no time to go out and stick our tongue to freezing poles
1465129	1468412	How to Treat a Tongue Stuck to a Frozen Pole
1494124	1494805	How appropriate.
1495025	1497848	Number one, do not pull the tongue off the pole.
1497928	1499831	Pulling sharply will be very painful.
1500291	1501292	Uh, duh.
1502133	1503875	Two, move closer to the pole.
1503975	1507640	Get as close as possible without letting more of the tongue's surface area touch the pole.
1508320	1510303	Three, warm the pole with your hands.
1510882	1513624	A tongue will stick when the surface of the pole is very cold.
1514164	1517666	A few top layers of the tongue will freeze when it touches the pole, causing bonding.
1518166	1521007	Place your gloved hands on the area of the pole closest to the tongue.
1521067	1522508	Hold them there for several minutes.
1523369	1522508	4.
1523489	1524269	Take a test pole.
1525049	1527871	As the pole warms, the frozen area around your tongue should begin to thaw.
1528251	1529952	Gently pull the tongue away from the pole.
1530432	1534655	You may leave a layer or two of skin on the pole, which will be painful, but the tongue will quickly heal.
1535195	1536495	And my last piece of advice?
1536596	1537456	You'll shoot your eye out?
1537656	1539077	Stay inside and play more video games.
1540004	1541945	or if you've got a friend, get some warm water.
1542285	1542685	No!
1543085	1543685	Play video games.
1545466	1546787	And then go out drinking sometime.
1547187	1552208	So you've basically rendered the past 54 advice columns completely useless with your little... No!
1552228	1553009	...go inside and play games.
1553089	1555410	What if somebody is stuck on a runaway camel?
1556510	1556970	Alright.
1557970	1564793	But I figured, you know, no one's ever going to follow my advice anyway, as good as it is, so...
1566069	1567209	Just go play more video games.
1568070	1571351	You're less in danger of getting stuck to a frozen pole or being on a runaway camel.
1571611	1573871	Goodbye, DarkSakura's advice column.
1575112	1576012	We hardly knew ye.
1576652	1577772	Or we were hardly listening.
1578773	1579373	Just teasing.
1579553	1579813	Love ya.
1580193	1583094	Alright, let's go on over to Loki.
1583534	1586355	Loki's got some stuff going on in the PSP homebrew world.
1586375	1588475	What's this, one of the biggest games ever coming to the PSP?
1588916	1589576	Something like that.
1590036	1593357	Basically, Quake 2 is being ported to the PSP.
1594197	1596539	And they're actually doing some pretty interesting stuff with it.
1596619	1603563	Obviously, you know, the PSP's got limited controls, you know, so how are you going to support everything that was in the PSP?
1604024	1617192	Well, basically what they're doing with Quake 2 this time is they're not only creating a control scheme that uses the actual buttons and stuff on the PSP, but they're adding the...
1618669	1621230	Remote for the headset, which is kind of neat.
1621630	1630915	So you know that little headset player that no one ever uses for the PSP that plugs into the headphone slot as well as that little serial port that's on there?
1630935	1634096	They're actually using the buttons on that for different things.
1634136	1641800	So for example, in actual gameplay, they have... Let's see here.
1642881	1643461	Team Emergency Exit
1671878	1686469	and they have a whole site here talking about what they're doing with the Quake 2 project and it's being developed slowly if you want to find out more about it check out teamemergencyexit.blogspot.com very cool
1689348	1694354	Speaking of controllers and innovative things, of course, Nintendo's Revolution Controller always got a lot of buzz.
1694794	1696196	A little bit of a follow-up here.
1697077	1710411	Eurogamer actually posted a little bit earlier a story that a lot of places were running, including us, last week about how Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess is going to be supporting the Revolution Controller.
1710811	1718698	Well, Nintendo has actually quoted in a story on Eurogamer that the article in the January edition of NGC Magazine is speculation.
1719059	1721621	Nintendo has not made an official announcement regarding this.
1721982	1723263	The game is still in development.
1723323	1725445	It will launch on the GameCube in 2006.
1727068	1729810	So they've essentially said, screw you to that rumor.
1730790	1737814	Other follow-ups going on is that, you remember we mentioned on a previous podcast that PlayStation 3 is going to be getting Unreal Tournament.
1737854	1739355	It's supposed to be a launch title.
1739755	1745358	Well, now it's kind of going back and forth a little bit, and essentially now it's going to be a launch title.
1745398	1746138	It's not going to be a launch title.
1746158	1746799	It's going to be a launch title.
1746819	1747619	It's not going to be a launch title.
1748060	1752382	Now they've said, Epic has come out and said, it will be done when it's done.
1752922	1756664	And if it just so happens that it's done when the PlayStation 3 is out, great.
1757004	1759825	But we're not pushing to be a launch title or whatever.
1759965	1760886	It's done when it's done.
1761706	1763647	That's so much agony and ecstasy.
1764508	1765448	You've seen that movie, yes?
1765928	1766148	No.
1766649	1769870	It's the one about Michelangelo painting the Sistine Chapel.
1770530	1771671	When will it be finished?
1771951	1772912	When it's finished?
1775373	1775813	And Cultured!
1799749	1800430	That I don't get.
1800530	1802712	How the F were they there and we weren't?
1802732	1803433	I don't know.
1803853	1810779	But anyways, it did shed some light on how they're going to be using the Revolution controller probably for older games.
1810859	1813462	But anyways, for example, The Legend of Zelda.
1814242	1820508	One controller will be used to slash your sword and the other controller can actually be used as a shield.
1821389	1825012	There's also a fishing minigame, which I'm assuming is in...
1827318	1828419	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1846644	1847285	Super Smash Bros.
1847325	1847845	Every time you hold...
1870400	1872522	You punch while holding the controller on screen.
1872542	1873683	Your character will do the same.
1873723	1877705	The Revolution Remote controller also has a rumble feature so it will vibrate whenever you hit.
1879567	1879887	Interesting.
1879947	1880547	Interesting.
1880727	1882989	I wonder what they're going to do with some of the old school games with this.
1883309	1884910	Someone else brought up something very interesting.
1884990	1892556	Since it does use the old GameCube controllers and it has the port on there, maybe you can use your old GameCube controllers for some of these games as well.
1893196	1895438	Instead of actually having to use the Revolution controller.
1896538	1896779	Maybe.
1897919	1898360	Interesting.
1899329	1903810	All right, well, let's see what people are commenting on stuff that we do.
1904010	1906051	And the way we do that is we open up our old mailbag.
1906111	1909632	It's 2go at orangelaunchradio.com is the place to go if you want to get it.
1909952	1910692	It's the place to go.
1911072	1913312	If you want to send us an email, 2go at orangelaunchradio.com.
1913332	1920934	But actually, that email address may be changing because we're actually dropping the 2go name from our show starting next week.
1920954	1922395	We're just going to be Orange Launch Radio.
1923795	1925337	That email address will still be good.
1925397	1925818	Don't worry.
1926178	1927099	No messages will be lost.
1927139	1929662	It will simply forward to whatever the new address ends up being.
1930263	1931625	We'll let you know what that is next week.
1931685	1935489	So you can still continue to send your messages for now at togo.org.
1936050	1941136	And that's where DarkSakura is going to open up the mailbag and peer in there and see what's in there.
1941236	1943179	So what do we got this week?
1943602	1946567	Oh god, I've got so much freaking email.
1946827	1949631	Well, pick a couple good ones and see what's up.
1950412	1954638	Our buddy Lord Kausu on the board, also Takuland.
1954778	1954959	Sure.
1955683	1961248	has basically pretty much corrected me on the game I was trying to think of for PC Engine, one of those betas.
1961908	1967353	It was Space Fantasy Zone, which is the one that I do not have, because it's only a beta.
1968074	1968754	I don't even remember.
1968814	1969335	It's been a week.
1969395	1973118	Our listeners are great at memory, but I can't even remember this discussion.
1973198	1973999	That's all right, all right.
1974139	1979524	But that was the other Fantasy Zone game I was trying to think of on TurboGrafx that I don't have.
1980606	1981446	because it was only beta.
1981866	1983547	But there's downloads available.
1983807	1988028	I was playing Fantasy Zone 2 on GameTap this week because I never realized that there was a Fantasy Zone 2.
1988768	1989888	I have it on Master System.
1990248	1991429	Yeah, that's what it was on.
1991789	1993389	And Fantasy Zone The Maze.
1993609	1995510	I just want to point out it's the same damn thing as Fantasy Zone 1.
1995670	1996030	Yeah.
1996570	1997950	Okay, just wanted to make that clear.
1998491	2000491	Yep, it sure is.
2001651	2008233	Also, we got... I do apologize because I'm trying to go through the list.
2009711	2024596	Um, someone, Crispy Creamy, emailed us, uh, saying, I heard a rumor about the PS3, is it that the PS3 will have something in each system, so when you put a new disc into your system, it marks the disc, making that disc only play on your own system.
2025296	2026137	Is this just a rumor?
2026417	2027677	It has to be just a rumor.
2027697	2027957	It's a rumor.
2028297	2030758	That would so lower on their marketability.
2031098	2031538	Seriously.
2031818	2033159	And it would piss Gamefly off.
2034762	2060369	essentially that would kill a company like that to do that to games I think borrowing games from friends and all that stuff I think that adds to I realize I want to combat piracy but that's I don't think that's the way to do it that's not the way to combat piracy because you know then you can't let your friends borrow games that's how I found out a lot about a lot of great games especially back in the 8-bit NES day and still to some extent today so that that would not be a smart idea Sony if you're listening
2061052	2064735	Psychonauts for PsyOps, The Mindgate Conspiracy Grim Fandango, Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Monkey Island
2083576	2087098	This person has the single best name ever, by the way, My Little Pony Killer.
2115922	2116463	Chippa Thingy
2130793	2131814	I have some stuff to say, though.
2131874	2134817	First off, on the latest podcast, you read a list of games that need a sequel.
2135337	2136738	I think StarCraft should have a sequel.
2137138	2138139	That game was awesome.
2138279	2149388	It was the game that got me into PC gaming, but Brood Wars has an expansion, even though it had enough game in it to have been released as StarCraft II.
2150569	2152670	Next, I think Ninja Gaiden should have a true sequel.
2152751	2155573	Ninja Gaiden Black was not a true sequel, and I want more.
2156656	2160420	and mentioning about bringing Ninja Gaiden 2 on Xbox Live Marketplace.
2160460	2162963	But that's... What was that?
2163003	2164344	Tecmo did it.
2164384	2165025	Yeah, Tecmo.
2165045	2167748	I don't know if I was thinking Sega for a moment.
2167808	2168889	Because Sega did Shinobi.
2169250	2170171	That's why I was getting confused.
2170191	2170551	But Tecmo...
2173454	2175115	I don't see why they wouldn't do it.
2175155	2176916	They're buddy-buddy with Microsoft now.
2176936	2183659	Do you remember on the Super Nintendo they had the Ninja Gaiden trilogy on Super Nintendo?
2183699	2185100	It was like all three games on one cartridge.
2185460	2189262	It was kind of interesting because it was one of the first collections I remember that early on.
2189603	2190823	But they didn't change the games at all.
2190843	2191904	It was just three games, one cart.
2191924	2192584	It was kind of neat.
2193265	2194385	Yeah, I'd like to see a more...
2196347	2200871	I mean, I like Ninja Gaiden, the new version and all, but I'd like to see something a little truer to the roots, sure.
2201211	2204094	But do you remember the old, old, old Ninja Gaiden arcade game?
2204634	2207076	It really didn't play like the Nintendo ones, to me anyway.
2207116	2208718	It didn't play like the Nintendo ones to me at all.
2209939	2214323	But there was also an interesting question on here.
2214363	2216605	What's with this next generation pricing anyway?
2216965	2220488	You pay $10 more for the new Madden when it just has slightly prettier graphics.
2221009	2221089	What?
2221633	2224496	Their excuse is higher development costs to get these higher rents.
2224636	2225537	It's just a big excuse.
2225597	2226678	I know, it's a big bunch of blah.
2226838	2227438	Give it time.
2227478	2229440	When the other two systems come out, there'll be competition.
2230061	2231842	Nintendo will try to undercut them all.
2232143	2233544	Well, that's the whole thing right now.
2234225	2236126	It's like, okay, 360 games.
2236487	2239690	They're all coming out at $60 pretty much, except for three of them.
2239710	2241291	What are you going to do?
2241652	2242993	Buy a different game?
2243073	2244874	Sorry, there's only two games coming out that month.
2245951	2247031	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2275168	2276555	I don't like government and gaming.
2276595	2277420	It just doesn't work.
2277440	2278545	Alright.
2278787	2279771	Any other emails, DarkSakura?
2280563	2281683	Well, yeah, I got kind of a few.
2281723	2285184	And I got a few from our buddy Rob, who I always love hearing from.
2285884	2292246	But I'm just going to go over them in a little bit of detail.
2292266	2300428	There was one about the PSP to TV converter on iGearLive.com.
2301288	2304389	Another one he sent me was a pretty long article.
2304589	2309190	I'm not going to go into too much detail, but I would love for our listeners to read this because it's a very good article.
2310050	2312991	Um, yeah, I said he found it on a slash dot.
2314152	2319454	Um, but there, it's talking about how EB and GameStop relies on used games to stay afloat.
2319474	2326276	And honestly, I can, that's all I hear about is getting those used game sales in and using that discount card and all that.
2326937	2332599	Um, but the article is at escapistmagazine.com slash issue slash 26 slash 3.
2332679	2332739	Um,
2336079	2350648	To sum it up, and I read through quite a bit of this article, it's that once more places start doing more online content, as far as the old games go, there may not be as much of a let's purchase the used games.
2350908	2356712	And so that's really going to take a lot of the steam, a lot of the livelihood out of what keeps these companies alive.
2357153	2357473	Interesting.
2358373	2360734	It makes sense because consider how GameStop started.
2360774	2362694	It used to be Funkoland, which I remember.
2363074	2363635	Used games!
2364195	2367556	Yeah, the 8-bit days, they would advertise in magazines.
2367576	2369276	It was a mail-order company for used games.
2369716	2370116	I don't know.
2370316	2375257	I think that actually, if anything, you would want more people to buy used games.
2375297	2376318	Like, for example, Halo.
2376718	2378498	Halo 2 right now, you can buy a used.
2378558	2379318	It's pretty cheap.
2379639	2384460	It's still one of the most widely played games out there, and you can download different content, maps, and stuff for it.
2384520	2385500	So it sounds good to me.
2385916	2389519	For the record, I would like to point out that GameStop and Funkoland were two different places.
2389639	2396504	GameStop is a fully owned subsidy of Barnes & Noble.
2396584	2398105	But didn't one buy the other at some point?
2398166	2398346	Yes.
2399186	2407253	GameStop purchased Funkoland, Babbage's, Sawfare, etc.
2408413	2413898	But they're all fully owned subsidy of Barnes & Noble, which is why I get books cheap.
2416059	2417020	All right, anything else?
2417220	2418141	Was that it for now?
2418181	2418581	For now.
2418802	2419062	All right.
2419582	2420283	Keep them coming.
2420563	2422365	To go at orangelaunchradio.com.
2422525	2423666	We welcome your emails.
2425087	2428190	Let's go back over to Loki, who has a story about the Eye River.
2429171	2430132	Yes, Eye River.
2430552	2437418	It's the thorn in all of those wonderful portable MP3 player's sides.
2437678	2441962	This time they're actually trying to get into the game market, which is quite interesting.
2442663	2444464	With the brand new iRiver G10.
2445084	2450306	It actually looks kind of like a, to be honest, it looks like one of those things that Ben Heck would have made.
2450346	2453227	You know, the guy that did all those retro consoles and the portable systems.
2454227	2466072	But anyways, it has a nice 800x480, 260,000 color display, as well as it's running off of Windows CE 5.0, kind of like the Commodore Portable.
2466728	2473336	It's also going to contain a 4 or 6 gigabyte storage on the actual system right now.
2473376	2477941	They're kind of just showing it off as being able to play videos and stuff like that and some Korean games.
2478321	2479803	Not really too much on it right now.
2480284	2482646	Some people are saying, oh, this could be the PSP killer.
2482926	2483307	I say no.
2484229	2485670	You know, it's interesting, though.
2485710	2488713	I mean, do you know who everybody says should be getting into gaming?
2488733	2492496	Well, not everybody, but, you know, I keep seeing this on message forums, who they say should be getting into gaming.
2492916	2504305	And, you know, a lot of people think that it's one of these things where they're just going to come out of nowhere when no one realizes it, and they're either going to fully back somebody else, or they're just going to come out with their own thing that's just going to blow your effing mind.
2504345	2504765	You know who?
2505166	2505386	Apple.
2505506	2505746	Apple.
2506567	2509029	And, you know, I just...
2509995	2510577	Look at them.
2510798	2512342	Don't they look like they're up to something?
2512823	2515110	Don't they just have that look on their face, Apple?
2515868	2520772	Yeah, and they'll make a game system that looks pretty and people will buy it despite the fact that the specs suck.
2520852	2522813	Well, who knows?
2523173	2523474	I don't know.
2523514	2526216	I get this feeling Apple's got to be up to it.
2526256	2528758	If Apple wanted to enter the handheld market, they could.
2528798	2531380	If Apple wanted to team up with Nintendo, oh my god.
2531420	2532520	I've said this on an earlier podcast.
2532981	2539566	Apple, Nintendo, these two companies excel at getting you to buy the same damn thing with cool new features over and over again.
2539586	2540346	Look at the iPod.
2540927	2542828	iPod Mini, iPod Nano, iPod Video.
2543108	2544149	And look at the Game Boy Pro.
2544687	2545888	Game Boy Advance, Game Boy SB.
2546548	2549509	If these two companies got together, it would be dangerous to your wallet.
2550450	2551510	But just food for thought.
2553091	2553331	All right.
2554132	2561836	Xbox 360 is pissing off Gamefly a little bit because they are getting a lot of scratched Xbox 360s back.
2562396	2566558	And they're actually having this form letter now that's going out that says, essentially...
2567250	2595494	you've been identified as somebody who sent back a scratched game to us if in the future should Gamefly receive Xbox 360 games from you that have been damaged you'll be charged a replacement fee so they're getting a little ticked off that a lot of their games are coming back scratched should be noted that we haven't really seen this for the others obviously all the systems are CD based so it seems interesting that this one's making headlines about the Xbox 360 because they're the only ones that have like a really shoddy put together CD-ROM drive that doesn't have the buffers in them to keep this level and so when you tilt it
2596072	2597653	or bump it, it scratches.
2597873	2600516	So don't move the Xbox 360 while you're playing your game.
2601096	2601396	Yeah.
2602677	2610244	Oh, side note though, and what I thought was quite interesting is the Xbox 360 knows whether it's on its side or on its standing up.
2611425	2616288	It's got a level in there because there's a little light on the little ring of light that shows which controller is player one.
2616689	2620072	If it's on the ground, it will be still up in the upper left corner.
2620312	2624155	You tilt it up, it will move itself so that it's in the upper left corner.
2624873	2633538	I just want to mention real quick, Blood Rain came out in theaters this week, you know, Uwe Boll's latest epic.
2633918	2637360	I think it grossed about a million dollars, well out of the top ten this week.
2639661	2640582	Are any of us surprised?
2642942	2646986	He has the next three films financed already, so we will be at least seeing three more films.
2647107	2650170	You know there's one of those stupid little internet petitions going on?
2652792	2653293	That's old.
2653373	2654194	I've seen that before.
2654314	2655195	But it made me laugh.
2655695	2656476	It really made me laugh.
2656496	2658078	It's getting a resurgence now because of this movie.
2658398	2663984	By the way, I should point out, internetmoviedatabase.com, it's already showing up in their bottom 100 movies of all time.
2664744	2665565	44 last time I checked.
2665805	2667567	All right.
2667767	2669389	Let's go and get another story.
2669789	2675874	Let's go over to DarkSakura, who has another story about the 360, something about the UK for our UK folks.
2676955	2678397	Actually, yes, I do.
2679830	2687795	There's basically a European Xbox Live marketplace has been keeping playable demos and supplies.
2687895	2695460	However, they have found a way to get American and Japanese games, some of the demos.
2697041	2706327	Apparently the way to do that, according to GamerReport.com, is all you have to do is go to Microsoft's password site and create a new Hotmail account and then say you're either from Japan or the United States.
2707981	2708622	That's kind of smart.
2708882	2710604	Make a note of the phone number that you supply.
2711505	2715809	And once you've activated it, turn on your Xbox 360, press the guide button, and select Switch Profile.
2718254	2719855	Huh, good way to get around that.
2719955	2720755	Smart thinking, guys.
2721856	2728539	My source hasn't tried it out yet, but I would love to listen to any of our UK listeners that have an Xbox 360.
2729019	2729459	Give it a try.
2729479	2730160	Let me know what you find.
2730420	2738623	Now, it does... I have seen... This is actually also on Xbox360.qj.net, previously known as Xbox 360 Updates.
2739624	2741584	They have tried it, and it does work.
2741885	2744726	So, what you can gain, though, from...
2746055	2746276	RidgeRacer6
2756394	2758275	Virtual Reality in the Revolution, Loki?
2783493	2789899	Yeah, and the continuing saga of... The continued speculation about 3D on the Revolution.
2790079	2790639	Exactly.
2791260	2797765	At CES this year, they were showing off a 3D visor called the Z800 3D visor.
2798186	2799166	It was actually put out...
2800467	2801688	by a third-party company.
2818949	2823591	So everybody is kind of taking a look at it, but still kind of backs up the whole thing, you know, virtual reality type stuff.
2824132	2826413	Probably checking out to see what their competition's doing, you know.
2826873	2832135	I'm still saying, E3 this year, come find out, you're going to see something different.
2832515	2838298	And there's another thing that they've actually registered, the Nintendo, was it like Floor Vision?
2838618	2839699	I heard about that, yeah.
2840379	2841240	I just love the first line of this.
2841260	2842101	It's official.
2842121	2844142	The IRS has its eyes on your virtual gold.
2844162	2845384	Oh, I did hear about that.
2845404	2846424	Okay, what's up with this?
2862825	2868068	Well, it's basically saying that they're just kind of keeping an eye on this as a potential.
2868809	2892263	But the latest issue of Legal Affairs Magazine, IRS Advisors Specializing in Barter Income, recently offered the opinion that any trade of one virtual item for another, gold pieces for thick leather, Uber drops for platinum, could constitute taxable income gathering exchange according to the IRS's rules on barter.
2892591	2894752	But how can you enforce that with a worldwide game?
2895352	2895772	Yeah, I know.
2896992	2899153	But... They're not real items.
2899953	2900533	I know.
2901094	2904014	What's the government going to do with 10 gold pieces in WoW?
2904094	2904895	I mean, seriously.
2905095	2910216	But basically saying so long as each good has a determinable fair market value.
2910596	2910796	Yeah.
2911116	2912977	You're not going to be paying them in gold pieces.
2912997	2914317	You're going to pay them in real money.
2914838	2917298	Yet, you're not actually exchanging real money in the game.
2917398	2919499	How would they enforce that out of a European player?
2919778	2921459	Well, that's basically the problem.
2923039	2927240	They have to... Right now they're working on consistency for it.
2928261	2929961	A lot of people have objected to this.
2930021	2931642	I mean, just really objected.
2931682	2931962	Well, duh.
2932002	2932922	It has to do with money.
2936023	2942525	My thing is, though, is I'm going to take significant losses in these games because if they can take it, I can take it.
2942565	2942945	That's right.
2942985	2944525	I could write it off, my taxes, right?
2944845	2946546	If I start a business and wow and lose money.
2947132	2956468	Imagine just what a pain in the ass it would be for there to be issued 1099s on every single player.
2957910	2961196	We're talking people who aren't even old enough to be taxed.
2962766	2968572	You can't own real land, but hey, we can tax you for getting that, you know, helmet.
2968872	2970574	Something tells me this ain't gonna fly.
2970594	2971475	It's not gonna.
2971755	2972576	Weird idea.
2972996	2974798	And if it does, I'm freaking moving.
2975179	2978642	Why are people in the IRS actually, why are they actually looking at this?
2978702	2980544	I mean, don't they have better things to do?
2980625	2982226	Because our government is PO.
2983848	2984188	All right.
2984208	2984689	They want money.
2986209	2989591	Fantasy Star Universe is a game some of us here have our eye on.
2989611	2994754	It was supposed to be coming out for PS2 and PC in Japan on February 16th, but it's been pushed back.
2994854	2999116	March 30th now is the new date that Fantasy Star Universe will be coming out.
2999576	3001817	Quality improvement is the reason.
3002658	3007620	It's unknown yet what it'll do to the US and European release dates because they weren't unscheduled.
3008020	3013163	So, spring, summer, who knows, but Fantasy Star Universe is at least making its debut sometime in 2006.
3013303	3014624	Should be interesting.
3015686	3018847	Loki's got one more story for us tonight regarding Mario Mix.
3020047	3024348	Mario Mix, it's official from Nintendo.
3024709	3026729	They won't sell anymore.
3027949	3028590	It's done.
3029010	3035512	Now, whether it's coming back at some point, who knows, but you're not going to be able to find it because stores can't do reorders on it.
3036292	3038692	They're not making any more as far as it's concerned right now.
3039613	3040873	So if you own it, lucky you.
3041013	3041713	It's a collector's item.
3041813	3042834	Yeah, it's gone.
3042854	3044194	I should have bought it when I had the chance.
3044847	3046408	Final Fantasy XII PlayStation 2 coming out March 16th in Japan.
3073931	3075993	and it's going to be going out for an open price.
3076714	3077535	What the heck does this mean?
3077575	3081058	This means that there is no set manufacturer suggested retail.
3081378	3084762	The stores can just sell it at whatever price they want to set.
3085222	3094331	Of course, Sony and Square Enix sets a price to the retailers, so I don't know, this whole thing doesn't really make sense to me, but the retailers can choose their own profit levels, which I think is very interesting.
3095225	3109681	I'm going to take a wild guess here, and since there is no profit in systems, as we had a conversation earlier this week about how systems are sold for about $5 more than what the retailer pays for them, so my guess is going to be maybe around what they're paying for them.
3110381	3116288	And get this, you also get with this a PlayStation 2 stand and a Final Fantasy XII phone strap.
3119705	3122827	One more story for us tonight, and DarkSakura is bringing it to us.
3122907	3127471	It has to do with a new game coming out featuring some classic characters.
3128192	3130734	I remember talking about these guys before, so what's happening?
3131494	3133156	It's just a little tiny something.
3133216	3138961	Namco, I love Namco, has basically confirmed for us Snoopy vs. the Red Baron.
3140712	3157986	and it's where Snoopy has a magical dream and becomes a World War 1 flying ace who must pilot a biplane to stop the Red Baron Crimson Skies featuring Snoopy is great I just think that's going to be cool I'm hoping that they have the unlockable Snoopy's doghouse as the plane
3159529	3166573	I'm hoping they have the unlockable minigame where Charlie Brown tries to kick that football from that fucking bitch that never lets him do it.
3166713	3167133	Lucy.
3167313	3167914	Yeah, Lucy.
3169434	3171035	You can finally kick the damn ball.
3171315	3173537	And steer past the kite eating tree.
3177579	3178960	Linus searches for his blanket.
3180200	3181521	Final thoughts time.
3181601	3183182	My final thought is good grief.
3183422	3184603	Loki, your final thought.
3185023	3188305	My final thought is I've got to play some more 360 stuff.
3189482	3190863	DarkSakura, your final thought.
3191063	3192204	Reject false icons.
3192644	3195686	And that's going to put the nail in the coffin of this episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
3195986	3200649	Don't forget, we're changing formats next week, and we're going to be recording live.
3200970	3204972	So if you want more details on how you can join in on that, because we will be taking calls now on the show.
3205212	3207094	It's going to be a whole different field of the show.
3207474	3209535	OrangeLoungeRadio.com for more information on that.
