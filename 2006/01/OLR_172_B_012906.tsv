5314	12801	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
13141	15143	And now the conclusion of episode 172 for January 29, 2006.
19984	26745	And we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 172 for this, January the 29th of 2006.
27466	30486	And quite a busy first half there.
30746	32267	A little bit of controversy.
32687	35567	Was there a single controversial subject we didn't touch there in the first half?
35607	36187	I'm not sure.
36247	41548	We talked about politics, sexuality, fast food, everything.
41568	43869	We didn't talk about midget rights.
44989	45749	Maybe in this half.
45789	46149	We'll see.
47030	48310	There need to be more midget gamers.
49150	55473	For those that are listening to this on the podcast feed who haven't heard the first half of the show yet, definitely go back and download the first half.
55834	57654	It's a good show, so check it out.
58355	62857	Anyway, we're going to get back in because we have a lot of stuff to talk about in this half of the show.
64878	68940	We'll start off with Loki, who's got a story about Microsoft.
69381	70561	What's going on with Microsoft?
70881	72242	Are they doing the handhelds or not?
72282	74063	This is a rumor that's been going on for a long time.
74383	74703	Maybe.
75724	77625	That's, I think, the official response from
78725	89828	It's something that they're looking towards because they want to compete with the iPod and they're looking at maybe starting up a portable gaming development team or something like that or portable something development team.
90429	91829	So it's a maybe.
92149	94890	That's pretty much I think what the official word's been.
95650	100171	Something of course they're going to look at if they can figure out a way to do it profitably.
102660	108631	It'll be one of those things like, okay, well, we'll see what happens, but I'm not going to say yay or nay on it.
108871	115763	There's definitely not any firm plans on it, so it's just going to have to wait for that.
118368	118728	All right.
120468	125590	Moving on, I have some feedback from the chat room on the controversial subject.
125630	128570	Somebody mentioned that we didn't mention Jack Thompson yet during the program.
128610	130190	Tony mentioned that in the chat room there.
130611	131391	Thank God.
131491	134191	Well, I should give you guys an update on the Flowers for Jack campaign.
134211	137212	Remember we talked about that last week and how we contributed $20 to that effort?
137472	137912	Guess what?
137972	141213	They raised a crazy amount of money.
141273	146414	I don't think they posted the final figure yet, but when I last checked, they had something like over $900.00.
147754	174475	and it got to the point where it was they're going to spend $650 on the flowers and the rest they're donating to and forgive me, I don't have time to dig for this right now I think it's called Child's Play which is the foundation that the Penny Arcade folks set up when they were getting hit with the Jack Thompson stuff too so that's great, it's been a fundraiser in many ways That's a good thing Awesome, so congratulations to the Flowers for Jack folks So now we've mentioned that
176240	176440	DarkSakura
206567	207688	It's really my F.U.
208008	211370	You know, I actually mentioned it already in the show, but F.U.
211390	213791	to that woman at Barnes & Noble.
214152	217114	You know, just a big stinking pile of poo on her.
217814	228420	Because if you're going to say excuse me, even if the people haven't heard you, you still wait to acknowledge that they've heard you before shoving somebody out of the way.
228961	231322	I'm sorry, what has happened to the state of manners here?
231662	233624	How's that that she had her grandchildren with her?
234799	238241	She's teaching them that it is okay to push people out of the way.
238282	241344	See, Jack Thompson needs to focus on behavior like that.
242224	250110	On just general rudeness and the fact that people go around insulting and will not admit when they were the one who were at fault.
251531	251831	I'm done.
252291	259216	Loki, my FU of the week is going towards, you know, this is basically I have nothing right now.
260176	262178	Planet Earth for being a cocky bitch.
264391	264732	What?
265693	267636	Seriously, this planet is a cocky bitch.
267676	274044	It thinks it's like all, you know, holier than thou just because, you know, it's got life on it or something.
274104	274445	I don't know.
275046	275927	I got nothing, really.
276047	276347	I don't.
276387	277309	My week was okay.
277549	279171	I have nothing that really pisses me off.
279271	279892	Oh, wait, I do.
280153	280533	I'm sorry.
280553	281054	I take that back.
282349	288512	Fuck yous, those goddamn people that keep parking in the fire lane, thinking that it's their own personal parking space, even though there's a red curb there.
289172	293374	Every goddamn day, there's a car parked there, and nobody tickets these cars.
293855	295075	Well, fuck them, you see?
295796	305841	Because if I want to back out of my car, you know, back out of my space, which happens to be in the corner of this entire parking lot, you know, I have to avoid these people that are parked in these illegal spaces.
306201	310463	And the audacity of these people, they actually, you know, look at me like...
311209	311409	What?
312030	313370	You're in my way, you know?
313390	314331	It's like, fuck them!
315352	317433	I hate my apartment complex.
317453	319014	See, I knew you had it in you, being a liar.
319034	320695	But I also hate her, because she is a cockatoo.
321826	329069	Alright, my FU of the week goes to the Italian restaurant in Sacramento, and I'm not even going to name it because nobody outside the area would know it anyway.
329390	330830	They gave me food poisoning yesterday.
331190	335772	My pasta, like I had this dish that was lasagna and pasta, it was like a little bit of both.
336013	344556	The pasta was cold, and I should have known that something was wrong then, because that probably means my meat lasagna was undercooked, and I got very, very sick last night, and that's no fun at all.
344777	345757	Food poisoning sucks.
346217	347798	So, yeah, thank you, Jake.
348308	349348	You're listening to KTMI.
349449	350629	Let's change the subject promptly.
369659	369899	DarkSakura
394117	400560	I don't want you to feel left out, so we have gifts for DarkSakura that we brought back from Gamer's Day.
400621	401461	No, stop crying.
401481	402241	You're going to love these gifts.
402702	403922	This is a poster.
404022	406343	It's a Metal Gear Saga poster.
406844	407444	Very rare.
407704	408404	It's a promotional poster.
408424	409025	Metal Gear.
409085	409565	Exactly.
410045	411166	And check this out.
411886	413107	Here's what I do with press kits.
413939	421746	I'm going to give Jamie the press kit for Metal Gear Saga as well so she can check that out with her husband Dan who's a big Metal Gear fan as well.
422466	424428	You know what he was playing today was Gran Turismo 2.
424788	425009	Really?
425569	426550	That has nothing to do with Metal Gear.
426590	427010	Okay.
428412	428692	Anyway.
429232	430013	So don't feel left out.
430033	430393	There you go.
430774	435958	But I'm giving you guys that press kit for a reason so you can report on that for the site too and the stuff blog.
436038	437319	It even smells pressy.
437439	437740	All right.
438843	443348	So meanwhile, while Jamie's oogling that, Loki and I want to talk about Konami Gamers Day a little bit.
443368	447113	But Jamie, feel free to interject your thoughts because you probably have an opinion on these games as well.
447393	448875	Loki, what did you think of Konami Gamers Day?
448955	450276	It was a good time.
450336	451518	I loved it.
452038	457705	Thank you so much to Konami for inviting us and letting the podcast world get exposure to that as well.
457725	458426	It was a good time.
459706	460967	Let's talk about some of the games we saw.
461867	463168	Did you check out Tao's Adventure?
463508	463928	A little bit.
464468	466149	It's a role-playing game coming out for the DS.
466189	466969	It's going to be out soon.
467509	468570	I played a little bit.
468630	471891	The build that they were showing there, though, was like the full game.
472231	475672	So it started me off from the beginning, so it was kind of slow to get into.
475772	479614	So I seriously spent like 30 minutes of this game and barely got anywhere.
479734	485116	I mean, I kind of learned that you cast spells by drawing little symbols on the bottom part, and you have to memorize, like,
485396	487577	to cast a lightning spell, you draw a little lightning bolt.
487917	491978	It seemed okay, but it seemed like kind of like just your average run-of-the-mill RPG.
492218	494299	There was nothing about it that really excited me.
494839	496120	I don't know if you feel the same way, Loki.
496140	498320	Yeah, it was okay.
498500	504643	I think folks who are into RPGs and it seems like one of those monster collection type of games, you might get a kick out of that.
505203	506103	Street Supremacy.
506603	509944	Loki, what do you think of Street Supremacy, a racing game that's coming out for the PSP by Konami?
509984	511125	Well, it's actually pretty cool.
511185	514866	What it is, it's sort of a port of Tokyo Extreme Racer, so if you've
515353	518854	You've played that series, you pretty much kind of have an idea what this game is going to be like.
520215	520875	Looks pretty cool.
520975	529799	It reminded me, the comparison I had with it is, it reminded me of Wangdin's Midnight Toon, the arcade game.
529819	530539	It reminded me of that.
531559	532760	But it's a pretty good game.
532780	538022	There's not that many racing games out there for the PSP, so, you know, more the merrier.
538222	541023	And I know the price point on it is pretty cheap when it's coming out, so...
541881	544603	I ran out of time to check out Street Supremacy, but it looked okay.
544904	546525	I'm not a huge on racing.
546565	548086	I like Burnout, but we'll see.
548226	548807	Maybe I'll check it out.
549507	552270	One thing I liked a lot on the PSP was the Gradius Collection.
552910	553331	Sweet.
553611	554011	I like that.
554031	563079	I played through a little bit of Gradius 1, and it's cool because they changed it a little bit so that it's widescreen, and it doesn't really do it by stretching the image so much.
563659	569163	I think it happens a little bit, but they kind of went back and redid it, and you can tell they changed some things about the game, too.
569244	569684	For instance...
570004	577086	The first boss that you fight happens immediately after the volcano sequence in the first stage, for those of you guys that have played Gradius before.
577366	580087	So the volcanoes are in the way while you're trying to fight the boss.
580107	582488	So it adds a little bit of extra challenge to it, which I thought was kind of cool.
582508	584448	That means you can't sit in the hidey spot, right?
584548	585588	Exactly, exactly.
585868	588849	So they changed that a little bit, and they made it more seamless.
588889	590410	Like, it's a very seamless kind of game.
590430	593451	That's the only one I checked out, but Gradius Collection is going to have several Gradius games in it.
593471	594391	You know what that's going to mean?
594411	596871	That's going to be nine versions of Gradius we own.
597152	598072	No Parodius, though.
598092	598132	No.
598952	600313	That makes me upset.
600373	601454	We need more Parodius.
601754	602255	Maybe later.
602895	604396	Rumble Roses XX, Loki.
604416	605397	Did you check this one out?
605477	606618	This game's all TNA.
607018	608419	All TNA.
608840	614684	Rumble Roses is okay, but the problem I have with this game and wrestling games in general is that it's kind of slow.
615044	617886	The action's very slow in these kinds of games.
617947	618627	Very slow.
618667	619288	See, and that's the thing.
619308	626153	They were touting that the game had probably the best visuals on the 360, but the movements are all really jerky.
626653	626773	D.O.A.
626793	627073	4 and D.O.A.
627093	627754	Beach Volleyball
649984	660334	It's interesting, because I was taking notes during the keynote speeches, and I remember Akari Uchida, who's the producer of Rumble Roses XX, said that they were making fun of DOA a little bit.
660354	660675	Remember that?
660695	662517	He said, yeah, we're making fun of DOA in this part.
662857	664098	Because they have sequences in the game.
664118	670965	They have a photo shoot sequence, like you can take sexy pictures of the folks, and Loki summed it up.
671005	671666	It's all TNA.
671866	673488	Yeah, it's all TNA.
673528	673788	I mean...
674358	677520	It's fun, and I think it's a party game to me.
677540	678541	I'll be picking it up, for sure.
678561	681143	Let's watch the Super Bowl and play some Rumba Roses.
681483	682264	There's what?
682284	683544	There's one fighting game for the 360.
683905	685206	I mean, come on.
685446	686266	It's going to sell.
687507	689008	And it's a pretty fun game.
689629	693391	And definitely, just for the T&A factor, it works.
693892	695793	And you'll be able to play it online, which I thought was cool.
695913	699235	And you can customize your character, including the size of the boobs.
699776	702698	And the producer was kind of saying, oh, everybody...
702998	708227	It won't just be, you know, anesthesia versus anesthesia and they look the same.
708527	711832	You could customize the colors and the size and shape of it.
711853	714457	But I'm like, okay, on live, they're all going to have huge tits.
714517	715639	Is there a creator wrestler?
717321	721363	I think that was kind of their response to Create-A-Wrestler instead of being able to create one from scratch.
721383	722123	Yes and no.
722204	726485	They do, I think, have a Create-A-Wrestler, and then you can also modify the ones that they have on there.
726706	733068	I got the sense that Create-A-Wrestler was more you modify the existing ones significantly, not like Soul Calibur Create-A-Character.
733409	733949	A little different.
734529	734909	I don't know.
735289	740652	But the other things that they were going to have, they were a little bit different with it.
741772	745574	I know other than the Create-A-Character type stuff, which was pretty cool,
746035	746215	Sub... Sub...
774878	775658	Sub-sta-nance
796010	797991	I like all the add-ons they're going to have for this.
798031	799771	Like you get the Metal Gear Saga DVD.
799791	800911	They were showing clips from that.
800931	801752	That looks very cool.
801792	805693	Well, only if you pre-order at a major retailer like GameStop or EV or whatever.
805713	806953	But most people are.
806993	808414	You'll probably be able to get it either way.
808734	811334	And the original Metal Gear on NES and Metal Gear 2.
811394	812555	That's true.
812655	813515	The MSX.
813775	814715	Exactly.
814975	817076	Not the one that Kojima pretty much wrote off.
817096	817376	What was it?
817396	818016	Snake's Revenge?
818056	818556	Snake's Revenge, yeah.
818576	819077	Not that one.
819197	820117	The real Metal Gear 2.
820677	821437	I thought that was interesting.
821778	823759	The MSX one was actually pretty fun.
823799	829521	And it had the things that they referred to back in the first Metal Gear Solid about Big Boss and Gray Fox.
830102	832123	A lot of that was involved in Metal Gear 2.
832964	833424	Sweet Coden 5
852779	859289	is another one I kind of ran out of time to look at, and it's a good thing Miklatov stepped out for a little bit, or he'd probably punch me right now because he loves Suikoden.
859710	860631	Did you check it out at all?
861172	862554	I'm not a huge Suikoden fan.
862594	863175	I looked at it.
863315	864917	It looked pretty, but, you know, it's...
865540	866160	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
896394	897794	But yeah, I played them.
898054	898455	They're cool.
898755	899735	And I like the new controller.
899875	900935	New controller doesn't stick.
919318	920519	Well, consider yourself lucky.
920780	922261	You still should pick up one of these U.S.
922281	922521	controllers.
922541	925364	I have a mutant controller, and I am going to pick up a U.S.
925384	925664	controller.
925684	930049	And if you do happen to have a controller, the game will be offered with the controller or without the controller.
930289	932251	Oh, I didn't pick that part out.
932411	934533	That means they know we're out there.
935574	938196	That's why I have the advantage for working at a distributor.
938376	944779	For those of you guys concerned about the authenticity compared to the Japanese originals, I'm told that Anothers do show up in the game.
944799	950062	They're just locked away at the start, but you can unlock the Anothers for those of you guys that really want the difficult stuff.
950463	952784	I am hearing they changed some note charts.
953164	958706	But I'm hearing from folks who play a lot of Beatmania that it's not as bad as you think.
958986	967809	They changed note charts, mostly to add in some of the free scratch zones and things, because they are bringing over the free scratch zones, which showed up, I think, in some early, early Beatmania games in the Beatmania 3.
967869	968389	They had that.
968429	975372	I noticed it was in Metal Gear Solid, the remix, because I remember I have Beatmania 2 mix, and I don't remember the free scratching being there.
975932	978214	But they added that in there or something.
978534	979255	It was in 4th Mix.
979275	980516	It was in CM2.
981097	992486	It was also, I think, it was removed from, I think, if memory serves me correctly, I do think that it was in 2DX up until, I want to say, the Substream release.
993027	994548	The one that linked to DDR2 Mix.
994628	994808	Right.
995329	996910	And then after that, no more.
998447	999728	Questions from chat room here.
999788	1002510	Spirit Snare wants to know, how did the controller feel?
1002570	1003110	I want to know.
1003450	1011136	It felt like the regular controllers to me, but just the key taps were a little different, but nothing that's going to throw you.
1011256	1012917	I mean, it feels nice.
1012957	1016099	I think the US players are going to be very pleased at the improvements over the Japanese controllers.
1016139	1016519	I really do.
1016859	1018020	So I'm very excited about that.
1020953	1021514	Game Boy One
1045594	1047316	I don't know, they didn't say specifically.
1047516	1054427	It reminded me of them almost like selling a special features disc for the movie by itself.
1054447	1055308	That's what it feels like.
1055748	1059053	They actually did that for Metal Gear Solid 2.
1060509	1062630	And they're actually doing something very similar for Metal Gear.
1062650	1066052	Now to bring that up, the Metal Gear comics, they're also going to be doing on the PSP.
1066092	1068674	You can have these comics on the PSP.
1068714	1070915	It looked very well detailed and well drawn.
1070935	1073636	It looked pretty cool and a little bit interactive as well.
1073976	1078239	So I know one thing they were really pushing during the keynotes was innovation.
1078279	1079499	Konami wants to innovate this year.
1079540	1081921	And these two products definitely show that, that they want to be innovative.
1082421	1099251	for me, the deciding factor on the Silent Hill experience is price point because if Silent Hill experience costs as much as a normal PSP game I don't think that's fair because it's not a game but if it's a $20 thing, I think it'll be great and they're not the only ones doing comics either Capcom is getting in on that kind of action as well
1100004	1105949	Metal Gear Acid 2 Metal Gear Acid 2 is pretty good.
1106049	1108130	I didn't really care for the first one.
1108510	1109471	It looks pretty fun.
1109851	1114615	I really kind of wanted a Metal Gear Solid game, not really a card battle game.
1114715	1116516	I really hate card battle games.
1117397	1118238	Every single one of them.
1118478	1118538	The
1120689	1126391	Solid Eye wasn't as solid as I thought it was going to be.
1126431	1127852	We have to explain the Solid Eye.
1127952	1135555	It's actually a cardboard cutout goggle thing that you can put over your PSP and the game will play in some 3D fashion.
1135935	1138056	I had Virtual Boy flashbacks playing this thing.
1139156	1139996	It didn't work for me.
1140096	1141736	I didn't care for the 3D thing very much.
1141756	1145337	I thought it was kind of a cheesy feature, but you can take it off and the game looks fine.
1145697	1149558	It's interesting because the way it works is that it doesn't ruin the visuals of the game.
1149578	1152778	So I don't know how much I'd actually use this, the 3D goggle thing.
1152918	1154199	It's a throwaway feature to me.
1154339	1160440	It was kind of cool, but the other thing that I thought was funny, because this was in the Japanese version, they were talking about the sexy girls.
1161140	1162800	They do have a lot of sexy girls.
1162840	1166841	In fact, I remember seeing a dump of this game online or whatever, and like
1167483	1168604	I don't like country music and
1191956	1194899	I don't have a very good experience with Curio Revolution.
1195120	1196881	It's very similar to KR Party.
1198082	1199624	It runs on almost the exact same interface.
1199644	1202226	What I thought was interesting is they've added some interesting eye toy features.
1202567	1204849	You know how in KR Party you could create a character?
1205805	1212831	You can also create a character in the country one, but you can take your own picture on the eye toy and have your face on the character, which I thought was very interesting.
1213331	1214912	And you can also do the eye toy thing.
1214952	1220876	Some backgrounds have big TV monitors, and it'll put you singing in your living room in the TV monitors.
1221777	1223418	It's cheesy, but it's cute.
1223478	1224559	I think it'll be fun.
1224819	1228062	For the party atmosphere of Karaoke Revolution, I think it's cute.
1228562	1237249	And whereas I probably won't buy this game because I'm not much of a country fan, I think it's good that they're opening this franchise up to a new audience.
1238229	1240491	And the partnership with CMT as well, smart move.
1241912	1246876	And for my limited knowledge of country songs, it's a pretty good mix.
1248283	1249364	Uh, Yu-Gi-Oh!
1249545	1250205	USB.
1250786	1252148	It's a little Yu-Gi-Oh!
1252168	1254610	game you can put on, or it's Yu-Gi-Oh!
1254630	1258715	that's already on the USB and you can basically take it anywhere with you, plug it into the computer and go.
1258955	1261498	It's an innovation thing, but, I mean, Yu-Gi-Oh!
1261558	1262239	is great.
1262920	1266464	I thought it was quite interesting how they wanted to explain how it worked.
1266604	1268526	I'm like, I think we get it, you know.
1270686	1272691	How about DDR Supernova?
1272811	1273813	No, I didn't play that at all.
1274936	1279146	I was the first person in the United States outside of Konami to play the game.
1280540	1281781	You're staking that claim right there?
1281801	1282701	I'm staking that claim.
1283601	1290325	I believe I was number four in the play on that machine, besides Jason Enos and two other Konami employees that were testing it out.
1290825	1293126	I was on that game almost all day.
1293886	1294807	It was great.
1294887	1295307	I love it.
1295587	1302070	I'm really out of shape, though, and my only complaint is Fascination Max.
1302190	1303771	I think it's a dumb-sounding song.
1304230	1305153	The bonus stage.
1305333	1312631	Yeah, the bonus stage to the boss song or whatever, it sounds like a really crappy fan mix and the steps, it reminds me of a really bad sim file.
1313052	1341044	that's it's really sad that that's you know because they could do so much better and I remember like you know Paranoia Respect that was a cool remix of Paranoia and it sounded cool and was hard but it's starting to get to the point now with Max you know you have Max period which was just bullshit as it was as a song and a remix and now this is just a step beyond that and it I don't know might some people like it because it's super hard I personally didn't care for it but you know what there's 350
1342106	1343207	Some songs in this thing.
1343587	1344127	Who cares?
1344767	1346188	One song is not going to ruin it.
1346328	1346728	I don't care.
1347309	1348549	I had a real good time playing it, too.
1348569	1359234	A lot of repeats for me, but I understand that DDR, this is an early build, and I think a lot of folks on DDR Freak and stuff are running with this.
1359394	1363696	I think there's still much more news to come on DDR Supernova.
1363996	1365517	I'm just happy it's coming back to the arcades.
1365537	1365657	Yeah.
1365657	1369159	I have to understand that the build that we played on was 50% done.
1369199	1372802	It had 230 songs on it right now, most of which were repeats.
1372862	1373522	But who cares?
1374283	1375664	It's just the old stuff.
1375804	1378666	That means 70 new songs that are going to be in there.
1379186	1382728	I'm very curious to check out Battle Mode because that's something I've been bitching about.
1382748	1387191	It needs to be in an arcade DDR that's not Disney Mix for a long, long time.
1387231	1389253	And I'm really excited to see the Battle Mode.
1389273	1394016	I want to see what this is all about because I think DDR could be marketed as a very competitive game.
1394036	1395317	And it looks like it's kind of going that way
1395897	1396958	They're doing the tournaments.
1398058	1399259	Worldwide tournament mode.
1399339	1404081	It's going to be released in all three regions, US, UK, and Japan.
1405362	1407743	What's going to be great also, the interface is really strange.
1407803	1409524	There's no more backgrounds to songs.
1409684	1411925	I've noticed no more background pictures.
1411985	1413506	I completely missed that.
1413626	1417908	It's all just normal video unless it actually has a video.
1417948	1420850	Other than that, it's got the 3D stage with the dancers and stuff.
1420870	1422551	That could be something that's still being worked on too.
1422591	1422931	We don't know.
1423411	1424492	subsistence subsistence subsistence
1452671	1453512	I was thinking of something else.
1474591	1479612	Did you hear, though, that Naoki and Taka actually went down from Gamers Day to the location test?
1479692	1480272	Yeah, I saw that.
1480392	1481212	Yeah, very interesting.
1481272	1483833	Yeah, that was kind of funny, the whole story with Naoki.
1484133	1487233	He was there taking pictures of the machine and people playing and stuff.
1487653	1489394	He was kind of running around like a little girl.
1489414	1490174	It was kind of funny.
1491394	1494935	Just watching them so excited about everything.
1495315	1495815	It was great.
1497775	1500576	We got some cool gifts and stuff.
1501796	1502116	I don't know.
1502644	1505950	New songs, interesting to say the least.
1506411	1507734	Not too impressed with some of them.
1509277	1512744	I could care for a little bit less toxic being in...
1515658	1517759	Oh, that reminds me, Toxic in Beatmania.
1518759	1525822	I like what they did with the videos in the background, because it kind of reminded me of new videos for the songs, which are pretty cool.
1525942	1528383	Did you notice, though, in some of the videos, they didn't bother changing them?
1528443	1532444	Like, colors, it still says 2DX6 style in the corner in the video.
1532484	1533305	They didn't bother taking that out.
1533325	1533845	They'll probably change.
1534285	1536067	Well, I don't know, because it looked like a finished build to me.
1536127	1542073	And I noticed this when Taka was playing against the Konami employee, Ferrari, when they were battling each other.
1542093	1543674	Ferrari won, by the way, and Taka failed the song.
1543934	1547858	They were playing colors, and they had a little Six Style logo in the corner.
1547898	1550060	I noticed that, and it looked like a final build of the game to me.
1550080	1552883	I mean, this thing's coming out pretty soon, so I think they just didn't bother changing it.
1552943	1554064	But, you know, who cares?
1554144	1556226	It hasn't gotten gold yet, though, so I think it's fine.
1556386	1556947	We'll see, we'll see.
1557447	1561030	Anything else you want to say about Konami Gamers Day?
1561070	1562391	I'm really glad to have gone.
1562992	1565734	I wish they had shown more stuff that's coming out.
1566272	1566592	Namco Namco
1594947	1595548	All right, anyway.
1596649	1605539	Jamie, speaking of Jamie, Jamie, since she unfortunately was not able to go to Gamers Day, she was at school and at work, and she was also...
1606041	1606701	I was painting.
1607081	1608261	Painting and reading your letters.
1608781	1612182	Yes, I was also reading letters while I was supposed to be at school.
1612382	1619883	So, when you guys send in your emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, DarkSakura reads them and throws them away.
1620003	1620804	And then I laugh at them.
1621004	1621604	No, just kidding.
1622044	1626905	She brings them Sunday nights to the show with her to read them live on air, at least some select pieces.
1626965	1630905	So DarkSakura, reach into that mailbag and tell us who wrote us this week.
1631745	1635086	Well, just to go ahead and make a quick statement, I am going to be...
1636039	1643423	Limiting some of my letters to maybe about the top, I'd say, six letters that I receive.
1644203	1647185	So these are tonight's grouping.
1647965	1648866	These are the lucky few.
1650106	1655229	I'd like to start off with a letter from Simmel, who's one of our UK listeners.
1656690	1660872	Says, to let you know, in the UK we have Go Sudoku for PSP.
1661252	1662993	It's multiplayer and downloadable puzzles.
1663033	1663914	Best of all, it's only 20 pounds.
1665162	1669123	I'm sorry, we were talking about Sudoku last week, so I guess they already have a version of it over there in the UK.
1669363	1671744	They probably have a cheap one here, I just don't know of it.
1671764	1676325	On average, though, PSP games in the UK are anywhere between 35 to 40 pounds.
1676985	1678865	So that's actually a really good price.
1679926	1682166	I wonder how that compares to how much those books cost.
1682866	1684587	I'd rather have a PSP game before I have a book.
1684607	1687307	It'd be about like us buying a PSP game for 35 bucks.
1687507	1693509	I just don't see myself buying Sudoku on any system when a god like Tetris is right around the corner for DS, you know?
1693689	1694089	That's just me.
1694389	1698753	Well, I'd also like to say that he enjoys listening to the new format and likes how the show's progressing.
1698954	1699194	Thank you.
1699214	1699835	Well, thank you.
1701556	1708964	Another letter comes from DJ Ratchet, who's one of our newer people on the forums, too.
1709945	1711887	He wants to say that he loves the podcast.
1712107	1712447	Thank you.
1713028	1718093	And has questions about Kingdom Hearts 2, estimated release date in the U.S., and if there's really a Tron level.
1719187	1720388	Yes, there's a Tron level.
1721008	1723690	I do have a friend who owns the Japanese release.
1724270	1727312	I'm supposed to be obtaining it shortly myself.
1729613	1732995	And from what I understand, you know, I actually did have the release date.
1733035	1734436	I do believe it's the end of March.
1735676	1735756	31st.
1735836	1737457	Actually, it was 29th to the 31st.
1737477	1737938	I think it's 31st now.
1738877	1739057	Right.
1740038	1742680	Actually, I got my date through my resource, too.
1743520	1745261	Well, it's a good day lining up.
1745301	1745822	That's a good sign.
1745842	1746622	Yeah, mine's pre-ordered.
1746662	1747643	Mine's pre-ordered already.
1747743	1754568	But not only is there a Tron level, there's also a Steamboat Willie level, which is so adorable.
1754708	1764635	Okay, I think that they're getting into the whole music game thing because the entire Undersea level is like big old Horkin music game.
1765666	1766606	Interesting, alright.
1766626	1767707	A whole new world?
1783954	1785496	No, that's in Aladdin.
1786136	1787357	Don't ask me, okay?
1787577	1790200	But it's just hilarious.
1790320	1791181	Part of their world?
1791221	1792001	Part of your world.
1792121	1792842	Is that it?
1792862	1794003	See, I'm close.
1794383	1797486	Every Disney song has something about, I want to be accepted by the world.
1797867	1799768	I'm an outcast and I want to be loved.
1800769	1802110	I suck emo.
1802491	1804212	I want to be accepted by Blizzard.
1804252	1805934	I want to be loved in World of Warcraft.
1806134	1808036	For the record, there is a sixth emo ranger now.
1808499	1811222	Jack Thompson Let's Have Tea has emailed us
1825967	1827068	I love that nickname.
1827108	1827548	I love it.
1827668	1831392	Our listeners and emailers have the best nicknames in the world.
1831412	1834496	I mean, we had Pooface made a comment in the first hour of the show.
1834836	1835797	We had Let's Have Tea.
1835997	1836918	Pooface is awesome.
1837038	1837359	All right.
1837979	1839922	But every time I see Xander, I think of Buffy.
1840923	1842004	I think of Drawn Together.
1843612	1845493	I'm on a never ending quest to save my girlfriend
1865723	1866624	There's a light in my dark soul
1893578	1896404	Sorry, you had me on musicals, so forget it.
1896444	1896784	Moving on.
1897005	1904219	Pendragon writes in and says, this is support for Loki's whole PC fetish.
1905106	1906347	Oh, we have a Loki supporter!
1907787	1908988	You have to admit, it's about time.
1909528	1913210	We've heard the anti end of it, so now we need to hear the pro end of it.
1913230	1913630	We're fair.
1913970	1915931	We're fair and balanced radio.
1916472	1918853	It's not what it looks like, but how it actually works and performs.
1918893	1920153	We'll see about the new Intel Macs.
1920193	1925316	Honestly, this pretty interface will bug the system down and overall will not be as fast as the PC.
1925336	1927277	I'm a 3D graphic artist and I wouldn't bother with the Mac.
1927737	1928598	You want to know what?
1928998	1936063	Okay, you're obviously not a professional graphic artist because just about any professional will use a Mac.
1936683	1942708	And the Intel Macs are clocked to be much faster than their equivalent PC.
1945025	1945925	Which is why I'm getting one.
1947206	1949347	This PC Mac thing is so 2005.
1949988	1950948	I'm done.
1951068	1951389	I'm done.
1951789	1953410	Stop sending emails on it.
1953530	1954130	I don't care.
1954150	1961795	I can't wait until I get started broadcasting from my Mac because now the new iLife 6 has instant podcast support.
1962035	1963556	Will you be broadcasting in flavors?
1964637	1965417	Yes, I will have.
1965437	1967779	Stop egging this whole thing off.
1967979	1969119	Just sit down and shut up.
1969160	1971121	My show tastes like purple.
1971912	1972593	Alright, moving on.
1972633	1973273	Next email.
1973433	1976416	I'm going to do a podcast in a black like my soul flavor.
1977617	1978658	Okay.
1978798	1984302	Raphael writes in and says, I'm going to try not to rant about this, but here we go.
1984522	1986244	Usually that means there's a rant following.
1987064	1992028	The one thing that I find very amusing is that religious people say how bad and evil video games are.
1992129	1997133	However, they had even taken the smallest amount of time to read summaries of the game.
1997153	1998414	They would realize that the most...
1999554	2003978	games promote some of their morals, such as friendship, love, peace, tolerance, etc.
2005078	2011263	It just proves that most of the religious people in the media have blind, ignorant hate, which true Christians would frown upon.
2011784	2018009	However, I would like to note that not all Christians are like this, and not all video games deserve to be defended, such as games with blood, gore, dot dot dot.
2019029	2024754	Though this is only my personal view, as I would rather play Animal Crossing than shoot someone and laugh as their stomach explode.
2025359	2034745	Hey, again, I have a problem, and I'm sure the emailer didn't intend to do this, but I have a problem with the generalization of religious people, because you can be religious and not be a moron.
2035145	2036146	It's easily possible.
2036166	2037186	I have many... I know.
2037206	2037707	You just said that.
2037807	2042069	I know, but I just wanted to clarify as well, but, you know.
2045432	2045932	Anyway, moving on.
2046172	2046692	Moving on.
2047273	2049174	I'm sorry, I was taking a moment to savor my caffeine.
2049699	2050740	I do appreciate the perspective, though.
2050760	2050980	He's right.
2051000	2056285	You know, because it makes me think of something, and this has nothing to do with games but TV, so DarkSakura, just tune out for a minute.
2057146	2069376	There was this show on TV recently called Book of Daniel on NBC, and it got this huge flack from, you know, just the bad apples of the religious world that said, you know, it's sacrilegious, da-da-da.
2069897	2074120	But if you actually took time to watch the show, you'd see that it actually portrayed the...
2077543	2078824	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
2107515	2111319	Just goes to show it's the blind leading the, you know, brainless and blind.
2113240	2117764	I got an email from one of our listeners, SithSpawn.
2120407	2121928	Actually, three bits to bring up.
2121988	2126072	I'll go ahead and I'll paraphrase this a little bit, but I'll go ahead and read some of it.
2126712	2131617	Interesting bit number one, you can now listen to OLR and the other podcasts if you have a TiVo and broadband connection.
2132412	2134033	I heard about TiVo Podcast.
2134053	2135033	That's so awesome.
2135053	2137414	I would love to see our show on TiVo.
2137755	2139615	Take a picture of your TV and send it.
2139656	2148240	The article is located at publications.mediapost.com The URL is really long, so I'll just say look for it there.
2149960	2151861	He set OLR up and works great.
2151901	2154343	He even displays our logo on the TV.
2155343	2155723	Sweet.
2155763	2156263	That's awesome.
2157004	2157504	Send us a picture.
2157524	2157984	I want to see that.
2158044	2159305	Yeah, I would really like to see a picture of that.
2160131	2161997	I have TiVo knockoff on my TV.
2162017	2163522	I have Comcast, not TiVo.
2165026	2172629	Interesting bit number two, not sure if you mentioned this yet, recently PC Gamer announced that they will no longer use advertisements for items and gold farming services.
2173869	2177731	The article is at www.next-gen.biz.
2179251	2183273	Gamers that play MMOs just want to know what we think about that.
2183553	2193577	He says his opinion is that this is a great idea, not so much because it will put farmers out of business, but because it's a big statement that gamers are getting really sick of these game-ruining services.
2194840	2199402	I heard about it, and I think we were considering it for inclusion in previous podcasts, but we were out of time.
2199922	2207345	And I support the move, you know, and I don't know.
2207365	2208366	I guess that's all I really have to say.
2209659	2216420	There's also, um, the last thing is that last week I got an email from Sony asking me to participate in a PSP beta for Siphon Filter Dark Mirror.
2216940	2219761	Basically, go to a site, fill out a form, and they mail you a UMD.
2219861	2220281	The catch?
2220321	2223262	You need to sign up using the PSP browser and you need the newest firmware, 2.6.
2223742	2230223	I hit up the site about 10 hours after I got the email and quickly got a message saying they already had all the beta participants they needed.
2230603	2234024	The beta is full less than a day after the email, WTF.
2234244	2236104	A couple things to touch on that.
2236364	2238085	One, you didn't need the 2.6 firmware.
2238125	2239625	You could spoof it and it's no problem.
2239945	2244046	Two, it's not going to really matter anymore, which we'll cover later.
2244946	2245247	All right.
2245787	2253228	Well, what he thinks about that is it was a very limited beta, knowing that thousands of gamers would try to update their PSP to 2.6 to sign up.
2253308	2255429	For a siphon filter game?
2256604	2257245	That's a lot.
2257265	2267839	There was also another beta that's going on right now actually for Pursuit Force, which is going out to also people that are members of the PlayStation.com.
2268600	2269521	Of course, they select...
2270157	2271378	A few of them that participate.
2273540	2275882	Any other emails?
2276122	2278624	There is actually one more just because it needs to be said.
2278904	2292615	Also, I do want to go in and thank Rob Way for the article about the game writing from the first half of the show because he's the one who gave me that little bit of knowledge.
2295939	2304008	One of our writers, John Blanco, said that he didn't get bored of Nintendogs, just recently acquired 50,000 trainer points.
2304609	2307613	All dogs and interior decorations are now unlocked.
2308093	2309074	That's a quote.
2313220	2314581	Well, go on with your bad self.
2315102	2315722	You rock.
2315842	2316803	And your bad game.
2317644	2320006	Hey, I liked the puppies, okay?
2320126	2321628	Weren't you not here, Miklatov?
2321788	2322669	When did you come back?
2322769	2323910	You just appeared suddenly.
2324030	2325751	Well, I appeared suddenly with Starbucks.
2325771	2326532	Oh, yeah, that's right.
2326572	2327673	That's how the coffee got my hand.
2327973	2329014	He appeared with crack.
2329154	2329615	There you go.
2329875	2330736	Mm-hmm.
2330776	2331757	I'm almost out.
2331977	2333779	We remember what Thomi has to say about this.
2334279	2338443	Taco is into the to-be-sold pile for GameStop right now.
2340266	2346289	So is Ayn Menchie and my Dalmatian, who I forgot what I named.
2347389	2347810	All right.
2348230	2348970	So that's it for the emails?
2350111	2350291	Yep.
2350531	2359156	Send your emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and we definitely read them all, try to respond to them all, and read as many as we can in any given week.
2359396	2360336	So we love getting emails.
2360356	2361097	I've got a ton.
2361197	2363078	It inflates our egos and makes us feel loved.
2363458	2364839	I will take the top six.
2365489	2366630	Metal Gear Solid
2390545	2391546	So that's always good.
2392006	2394007	He says, look, I'm super busy right now.
2394388	2398731	I can only do three movies in two years.
2399271	2403113	So early I said I could do Hitman or Metal Gear Solid B Fall of 2007.
2404054	2406676	Not that they would give you the rights to it anyways, you jackass.
2406956	2418984	So, you know, he's not doing it, and his next piece of crap that's coming out is in the name of the king, Dungeon Seas movie, better known as We Ripped Off, Lord of the Rings for the entire thing, and it sucks.
2419738	2421620	Look for that coming in November.
2422241	2423502	Oh, in two parts, by the way.
2425244	2428447	Oh, and what's he made on BloodRayne so far?
2428868	2430109	Not jack shit.
2430129	2430810	$20, maybe?
2430830	2433833	So, you know, hopefully these studios will learn.
2435728	2436449	DDR West Virginia
2460532	2462835	Who knew that West Virginia still made the news once in a while?
2462875	2463656	I'm teasing, I'm teasing.
2464216	2474729	West Virginia actually, they had a partnership with Konami to put Dance Dance Revolution in 753 public schools.
2474769	2477472	That would be all of them within the next three years.
2477632	2479755	It was a pilot project that started last spring.
2480163	2482444	And they're actually going to incorporate it into schools.
2482905	2483925	I think that's kind of interesting.
2484946	2489848	And that's being helped, funded by Konami, as well as all the usual grants and stuff.
2489928	2491209	And they're playing Ultra Mix.
2491549	2493050	I don't know which one, but I know they're doing Ultra Mix.
2493070	2498353	Yeah, in the little clip here, you can see on Yahoo News where I pulled it from.
2498453	2500394	Actually, this particular one, they're playing Extreme.
2500614	2504777	Well, that's a lie when they actually play it, because it's Ultra Mix.
2505877	2506218	All right.
2506858	2507258	Let's see.
2507659	2508700	Why are they doing this here?
2509380	2519509	Health Promotions Manager Nydia Henderson, Manager for the Public Employees Insurance Program, says, One out of three children born in West Virginia today will have diabetes by the time they grow up.
2519569	2522552	This is a devastating statistic and not acceptable.
2522632	2527657	So essentially they're trying to make fitness fun and get kids into it via DDR, which I think is pretty awesome.
2528457	2531240	And to make people not afraid of West Virginia.
2531260	2531340	Yeah.
2532014	2536277	I remember what I said earlier about obesity being basically pandemic.
2537518	2539899	I applaud their efforts in trying to get kids active.
2540520	2544983	I tried to be a little bit of a fly on the wall at Konami's Gamer Day, and I picked up a little interesting tidbit.
2545063	2548045	All I can say is, this won't be the last of it that you hear.
2548265	2548985	This won't be the last of it.
2549005	2554869	You know a lot of independent schools in California are doing the same, just on their own, just buying the machine and making it part of their gym program.
2555189	2557391	Why can't I know this stuff and I work for Konami?
2557411	2557491	What?
2558629	2559129	Thank you for watching!
2572503	2573604	That's the important part.
2594286	2594406	Chuu!
2594426	2594606	Chuu!
2594626	2594706	Chuu!
2618200	2623124	Anyways, so it includes, you know, they have different things.
2623244	2635214	It's also kind of got a little bit of Ode to Jam type of feel to it where you can, you know, soup up your avatars with different items that you win by earning credits and stuff and learn new moves, songs, etc.
2635974	2639077	If you want to check this out, they're actually doing a free beta on it right now.
2639377	2643160	It's au.bugsgames.net.
2643640	2646583	I want to say that was headlined on our site earlier this week, so it should have a link there too.
2647523	2648326	OrangeLandsRadio.com.
2648787	2649469	Much easier to remember.
2651095	2651495	All right.
2652635	2655136	Now, audition something that can be played worldwide, yes?
2655436	2655716	Yes.
2655796	2658317	So that would include our friends in the UK.
2658397	2665519	However, you do want to have Internet Explorer for signing up on the site and everything because it only works in Internet Explorer.
2665579	2666599	Worst game ever.
2666819	2668059	No love for Firefox.
2668079	2668820	Worst game ever.
2669520	2669800	All right.
2669840	2673141	Anyway, I was trying to do a segue into the UK news that you completely interrupted.
2673221	2673901	Sorry.
2674021	2676122	DarkSakura, my segue is ruined.
2676222	2676602	UK news.
2676822	2677402	What's up in the UK?
2678004	2678645	Lots of stuff.
2679686	2688374	First off, there is a Crash Day demo from Atari put out for PC, PS2, and Xbox.
2689475	2693058	And the download is actually up on Eurogamer.
2693439	2696061	If you go to their homepage, there's a link to the demo.
2696802	2697583	I love Eurogamer.
2699609	2709278	Basically, the game is a combination of racing, stunts, and big ol' weapons, so you can make big smashy messes and design your own tracks.
2709879	2716445	Demo includes a wrecking match event and a stunt show event, and you can even try out the multiplayer mode via either LAN or internet.
2717025	2720729	You can only launch the demo 50 times, though, so be warned.
2721069	2722530	The official release date is February 24th.
2725268	2730610	Also, for our listeners in Australia, we never forget you guys.
2731750	2733371	The Xbox 360 has been delayed.
2733651	2735932	We have some in chat right now, too.
2736352	2738352	It's got to be a crazy hour over there right now.
2738372	2740093	It's something in the morning, isn't it?
2740153	2742674	Thanks to you early birds in Australia tuning in.
2743034	2743334	Love ya!
2744675	2745895	Thank you for hanging out with us.
2748077	2751839	The console was supposed to launch on March 2nd.
2751999	2754841	The date has been delayed to March 23rd.
2755422	2767951	Microsoft said that the slip-up was due to, and I quote, unprecedented global consumer demand and short-term manufacturing issues due to component shortages stemming from challenges in rampant supplies, meaning we screwed up.
2769362	2776748	Also, according to Microsoft, the launch date ensures that the markets will have an adequate supply of Xbox 360 consoles to meet demand at launch.
2777208	2779610	So maybe they're trying to learn from their little mess up with us.
2780815	2785456	Just to clarify, Deekman, who's our friend down under in chat right now, says it's actually only 3 p.m.
2785496	2785776	over there.
2786116	2786996	So that's not too bad.
2787016	2788577	No, not bad.
2789577	2795298	They also, though, expect to sell between 4.5 million and 5.5 million units by July.
2797099	2803540	Also, there was the mention, too, that demand is completely overpowering supply everywhere.
2804400	2808341	Microsoft said that they've lowered their 90-day sales forecast.
2809867	2812913	So yeah, they got a little bit ahead of themselves, huh?
2812933	2814856	Does everywhere not include Japan anymore?
2815538	2816359	Japan, they've only sold 100,000.
2818263	2819223	Yeah, that's not surprising.
2820104	2825526	Also, you know, I'm sure people who know me know I have a lot of love for SNK.
2826186	2827626	I have a Neo Geo.
2827766	2830387	I have versions of King of Fighters 2000.
2830427	2832648	The fact that you bought a Neo Geo is hardcore right there.
2832788	2835549	Actually, my husband traded a Sega CD for it.
2836710	2838390	And now we have another Sega CD.
2839991	2841291	But this was a while back.
2843432	2843512	Um...
2845840	2855328	Xbox is getting KOF Neowave, which is basically the same three-on-three fighting team.
2855728	2858531	You have 12 three-person teams.
2859211	2861934	Included are the women's teams with Mai, King, and Yuri.
2862995	2865076	The Fatal Fury team with Terry, Joe, and Andy.
2865297	2866337	You've got a tournament mode.
2866538	2869260	There's also three modes of play.
2870121	2871302	I don't really get what these are.
2871342	2873483	There's Super Cancel, Guard Break, and Max 2.
2874444	2874945	Excuse me.
2875505	2879850	Plus a new heat mode that lets you power up attacks in exchange for gradual loss of health.
2880771	2883474	Also, there's screenshots up on Eurogamer, so you might want to check them out.
2884475	2891842	Also mention, if you are a King of Fighters fan, King of Fighters 94 Rebound came out a couple weeks ago, actually.
2893023	2893924	For the Xbox as well.
2894665	2895586	I've got KOF 95 on Saturn.
2898664	2902785	If you've got a US Saturn, you have to do this thing where you put in your loading cart.
2902925	2904145	Change it out and put in the RAM cart real quick.
2904585	2908106	One of the, I think, three Saturn games that runs on a RAM cart.
2909387	2911727	Half the game is on cartridge, which doesn't help the load time any anyway.
2912987	2913988	Also, release dates.
2914628	2916288	I actually have two sets of release dates.
2916728	2920449	We have our UK release dates and Australian release dates.
2921709	2924430	So, let's go ahead and go through the rest of January, shall we?

2985106	3008970	Ridge Racer 6 of course now these are from what I'm seeing with these dates though I don't get why they're if the system's not being released until late March they're putting a February release date on them so PS2 um first February we've got World Series Poker Tied the Tasmanian Tiger um Sega Classic Collection on the 2nd February 6th We Love Katamari

3040963	3041443	Anything else?
3042824	3044965	And I won a winning lottery ticket.
3046526	3047186	Don't we all?
3047546	3048727	Does it matter if it's from the UK?
3048767	3049927	Could you win if you bought a lottery?
3050067	3050507	I guess you could.
3051368	3052048	I'd like a job over there.
3052068	3053069	Do they even have the lottery over there?
3053089	3053349	I don't know.
3053629	3053849	All right.
3053869	3054549	Anyway, moving on.
3055550	3057931	Let's go over to Loki, who has some news about the PSP.
3058669	3067552	Yeah, actually earlier I was going to cover that they had figured out how to load all homebrew for versions 2.01 and 2.5.
3068072	3075875	They were 90% done earlier today with getting 2.6 to work, and apparently while we were doing this show they already broke the news that they've
3076295	3078215	Crack, no, figured out for 2.6.
3078615	3083116	So now every version currently of the PSP can run homebrew.
3083977	3096539	Now these latest ones, everything from 2.01 up to 2.6 require Grand Theft Auto using it, the glitch or hack that was with the save files to load an e-boot loader.
3097059	3099219	And that's kind of how everything is working right now.
3099399	3102280	Some programs are working, some aren't.
3102720	3109303	So if you don't have Grand Theft Auto and aren't planning to get one, you probably should think twice about upgrading to 2.6.
3110463	3116446	However, new games that are coming out right now will require you to upgrade to 2.5 at least.
3116726	3119307	And some I hear are actually 2.6 now.
3119447	3121268	So something to think about.
3121648	3124169	That's all late-breaking as we're taping right now.
3124389	3125030	Yeah, pretty much.
3125510	3128191	So you can find that stuff on PSP Updates.
3128670	3131775	Deekman pointed out that the 2.6 was done, so that was kind of cool.
3132416	3132676	Awesome.
3134326	3136748	Alright, moving on, let's go to another topic here.
3136828	3138629	This is something completely different.
3138649	3145113	You know, I like to browse the various gaming websites out there, kind of seeing what's popular, and one of them I scan on a regular basis is Joystick.
3145514	3155620	That's with a Q. Joystick had a story this week about a gallery of video game endings, and it's mostly for classic 8 and 16-bit game endings.
3156301	3157181	You can actually check it out.
3157221	3162665	It's the Video Game Museum at vgmuseum.com, and they mention in this story a lot of endings.
3163065	3164106	Sonic the Hedgehog,
3164606	3166428	What happens if you never were able to beat Strider?
3167308	3171671	And of course, games that we all remember such as Metroid and things like that.
3171911	3174173	So I thought I'd kind of bring that up here in studio.
3174633	3178656	What video game endings do you remember that are so memorable that you love?
3179436	3179957	DarkSakura?
3180177	3184099	Ryu's ending on Super Street Fighter 2 with him just walking and the music playing.
3185460	3186941	Street Fighter 2 had some good endings, it did.
3187322	3189003	It was cool how every character kind of had a different one.
3189874	3191935	I remember how slow it was.
3192175	3194557	You know Street Fighter Alpha 2 came out on the Super Nintendo.
3194977	3196838	Only cartridge I had played with loading time.
3197138	3197599	Excuse me.
3198539	3201100	And the scenery would pop up.
3201221	3201781	Oh, characters!
3202101	3203382	Yeah, you kind of need them to play, don't you?
3204202	3211106	But I actually got my first screenshots from my old website, DarkSakura's Mostly Evil Shrine, from the Super Nintendo website.
3211126	3212447	I think I've been to that website.
3213297	3213937	Is it still up?
3214217	3214817	It's gone.
3216038	3217758	GeoCities finally deleted it.
3217778	3219738	You need to have a spin-off of Orange Jones Radio.
3219758	3220699	I've saved the pages.
3220739	3221199	There you go.
3221299	3222599	We should put it up for nostalgia value.
3222619	3223959	We'll put it up.
3224259	3225880	With its background midis and all.
3227100	3227980	Yeah, it was crappy.
3228140	3229280	But I hand-coded it.
3229901	3231181	I hand-coded my sites back then.
3231881	3232681	Other great endings.
3232781	3234562	Loki, Miklatov, anything you want to add?
3234802	3236982	Personally, I liked the ending of Final Fantasy VIII.
3238282	3238582	I don't know.
3239143	3240183	A lot of people didn't like that game.
3240503	3241243	I thought it was pretty good.
3242355	3244176	The ending was cool with selfie in the camera.
3244876	3245896	Final Fantasy IX, though.
3246356	3246876	That game sucked.
3248097	3248457	Megalov?
3248977	3249557	Silent Hill 2.
3249597	3252398	So sad and depressing.
3252438	3252958	I loved it.
3253778	3254198	Which ending?
3254859	3256399	The one I consider to be the true ending.
3256739	3257539	The dog ending, right?
3258059	3259340	No, the leave ending.
3260520	3261000	The one I saw?
3262220	3263561	With the letter at the end?
3263601	3263821	Yeah.
3263881	3264041	Yeah.
3264517	3267558	I hate myself and want to die one Strider I have actually beaten Strider
3281581	3282121	Hardcore.
3282281	3283842	Any given Mega Man game.
3284082	3284462	Yes.
3284762	3286023	Especially 2, I remember that.
3287003	3290144	Games I remember, especially from the 8-bit days, Super Mario Bros.
3290484	3293445	2, the Dallas OMG It Was All a Dream thing.
3294625	3295386	Who can forget that one?
3295426	3296126	Of course, Metroid.
3296466	3297006	Classic there.
3297566	3300187	And I think my favorite, though, would be Final Fantasy 4.
3300247	3302348	Final Fantasy 2 on Super Nintendo in the US.
3302868	3303328	Classic.
3303428	3304029	I love it.
3304149	3304749	I loved it.
3304769	3306189	Someone, why are you shaking your head at that?
3306289	3306770	I loved it.
3306790	3309671	Because I just recently played it again on the Game Boy Advance.
3310631	3310711	Eh.
3311923	3311983	P.K.
3312003	3312543	Akira88 says Actraiser
3329523	3336911	SSJ100Mac, Chrono Trigger, VXChasenXV, Stop Spoiling Silent Hill 2 After you have become sufficient enough level where you do New Game+,
3352806	3367001	and you beat the game immediately upon setting on to the teleporter you get the designer ending where they each leave you a comment and one of the people you meet is Toriyama Wasn't one of the endings where the girls would rate the guys in the game?
3368446	3369327	Dark Knight, Shenmue
3386397	3387658	No, because it's a horrible game.
3388178	3390660	Pooface says Half-Life 2 because of the cliffhanger.
3391300	3392201	And let's see.
3392481	3395223	Somebody said, oh, Pooface also said Halo 2 is the worst ending.
3396383	3398465	MiniMe283 says Zelda Ocarina of Time.
3399345	3400626	Yeah, that had a good ending.
3400646	3401086	That's a good ending.
3401106	3401586	Good stuff.
3401626	3402267	Good stuff, you guys.
3402787	3403147	All right.
3403187	3404348	Let's go ahead and move on.
3404388	3406489	Again, if you want to check out that website with Classic.
3406710	3409731	Not everything in there is considered Classic, so you may not find them all.
3410092	3412933	VGMuseum.com, though, for the Classic 8 and 16-bit ones.
3412953	3413214	No, no, no.
3413234	3414154	I forgot one more.
3414254	3414414	What?
3414715	3415375	The Guardian Legends.
3416934	3417354	Shit, yeah.
3417754	3418014	Yeah.
3419135	3421295	Loki, what's going on with Street Fighter?
3421315	3422936	We brought up Street Fighter in the ending stuff.
3422976	3424476	What's going on with Street Fighter now?
3424656	3429938	Well, as you remember, Street Fighter had a collection for it.
3429978	3443302	Now they have the Street Fighter Alpha collection, which is going to feature all of the Street Fighter Alpha games, including Super Gem Fighter, which is going to be pretty sweet as well.
3445555	3455238	They're basically going to also have the survival mode as well as dramatic battle which allows two-on-one tag team matches.
3456879	3460960	And I believe, I'm trying to remember if they added anything else in there.
3461360	3465722	I think overall though it's going to be a pretty cool collection of games.
3466022	3475145	They've also got I mentioned the Capcom Classic Collection coming out to the PSP pretty soon with
3475576	3476658	A lot of cool games on there.
3477780	3480504	You know what you need to put on one of those anthologies?
3480604	3480805	Huh?
3480965	3481546	Cyberbots.
3483869	3484811	That would be interesting.
3486754	3488577	Alright, what's going on with Splinter Cell, Loki?
3490242	3493403	Well, Splinter Cell Essentials is still coming out in March.
3494684	3499226	However, Splinter Cell Double Agent is postponed to September.
3500326	3506288	Much like they did with Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, they're tweaking the game to make sure it's perfect.
3506989	3512831	And they're worried right now that the installed base of Xbox 360 owners might not be...
3514045	3514485	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3531994	3533174	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3557078	3558539	Roll this up, landlord.
3558879	3564460	They're custom checks that have, hello, I am a check, please cash me, LOL, Katamari, do your best.
3565060	3570862	So is this just somebody took, because they have these custom check making services, so somebody just created Katamari checks?
3571582	3572482	I suppose so.
3573562	3579184	It says on there, there's a quote that says, I designed them, when you spend money, people should feel happy and also super lucky.
3579624	3582064	It is the most important thing to be contributing to the success.
3582344	3584185	For every special day, do not chase waterfalls.
3585876	3589300	PK Akira88 in our chatroom says, now I can bounce a check in style.
3590401	3591342	Yep.
3592383	3594386	You can roll up overdraft fees too.
3594566	3596108	Who knew that Katamari's bounced?
3598726	3601367	All right, we've just got a couple more stories left for you guys.
3601387	3605247	We are going to take just a couple quick Skype line calls right after this.
3605527	3609088	So you can call us on our Skype line, www.orangelunchradio.com.
3609108	3610308	Click on Interact With Us.
3610789	3613349	Or you can also call us over the regular telephone line.
3613389	3616530	However, please remember, it is not an 800 number.
3616650	3620130	So if you're not the person that owns the phone line, you need to get somebody's permission before you call.
3620451	3620871	The number, 916-226-7000.
3622958	3625659	The Effects of Video Game Playtypes on Pain Threshold and Tolerance
3647921	3648341	Interesting.
3648601	3652003	The study compared several different genres of games and their effects on pain.
3652283	3658425	They used action, puzzle, arcade, fighting sports, and boxing games, things that encourage high attention and stimulus.
3659366	3662387	The researchers also measured the emotional response to each type.
3664047	3676351	He concluded, Dr. Brian Radenbush, the director of undergraduate research, says, Physicians could possibly implement this in their office to aid in distraction during a painful procedure such as injection or dental work.
3676651	3681392	Video games could also be used in waiting rooms to distract patients from upcoming surgical procedures.
3682072	3690404	This principle, by the way, is one of the driving forces behind Child's Play, which we talked about earlier in the program, the drive to donate games to children's hospital wards.
3691185	3692367	Very interesting there.
3693388	3697935	I'm assuming that the Nintendo DS version of Under the Knife is not one of those games.
3698015	3699217	Probably not.
3699417	3699958	Probably not.
3699998	3700519	What do you think?
3700760	3702022	Is this legitimate?
3702543	3706029	I've heard of this video games being used in dentist's office before to distract people.
3706069	3706810	I think it's a great idea.
3706850	3711858	My dentist has CNN and it's distracting enough, you know, to kind of keep my mind off of...
3713058	3713838	This isn't new.
3714439	3728107	I remember being about 13 years old, watching something on the news program where they were using light hypnosis to have people go into dental surgery without anesthesia.
3729788	3730848	They had like a track.
3731309	3737212	They were actually testing it out with little children, having them follow it and saying, hey, follow the rabbit with your eyes, see where it ends up.
3737572	3740554	By the time the light would hit the end of the track, their surgery should be done.
3743834	3749276	I had a few things to follow up with, a few more stories real quick.
3749796	3751936	Just mainly Xbox Live stuff right now.
3752216	3758398	There's going to be an update to the Xbox Live for Call of Duty 2.
3758438	3762499	They're going to have a multiplayer update that's going to be happening, I think, Monday or Tuesday.
3763183	3770587	And also, there's going to be an update for the dashboard, which was going to add that feature for webcams and whatnot.
3770987	3772908	So that's going to be coming pretty soon here.
3773108	3777311	Also, last week, there was a couple things added to the Xbox Live Arcade.
3777851	3779952	Marble Blast Ultra, a brand new game coming out.
3779972	3781813	It's kind of like your Marble Madness type of game.
3782433	3788157	And then, of course, the demo for Full Auto hit last week.
3788237	3792139	So if you don't have that yet, you need to download it, because it's awesome.
3792719	3796943	All right, let's go over to the Skype line, see what you guys want to add tonight.
3797443	3806290	Of course, remember, www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on Interact With Us, and you can get all the details on how to call us via the Skype line, such as this person's doing right now.
3806350	3807651	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3808212	3809433	Hi, what's up?
3809553	3810093	Hi, who's this?
3810113	3811755	This is Xander from Florida.
3811855	3815798	Hello, Xander from Florida, who's on a never-ending quest to save his girlfriend, right?
3817222	3818063	I'm just messing with you.
3818183	3818584	What's up?
3820205	3822227	You forgot to mention Ico on the game endings.
3822888	3823309	I know.
3823349	3826212	I saw you guys shouting that in chat, and I totally forgot Ico.
3826272	3827533	Okay, now you said it.
3827573	3828354	There it is, Ico.
3828474	3829375	Yay, Ico.
3829695	3830576	Is that all you wanted to say?
3834781	3835381	I don't think so.
3835662	3836903	Okay, well, what else do you want to say then?
3836943	3838264	We're running low on time.
3838304	3838805	What's on your mind?
3840476	3848822	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3870526	3872307	But no ITGDDR.
3874629	3875650	Alright, Xander.
3876271	3878332	Xander, I'm letting you go because you're trying to start fights.
3878653	3879213	But have a good one.
3879233	3879854	Thanks for calling.
3880014	3880834	I'm just joking around.
3880935	3881435	I know you are.
3881755	3882376	Take care, Xander.
3883136	3883417	Okay.
3883457	3886879	Speaking of which, Pump It Up Zero ships to the US Arcades February 1st.
3886979	3888841	Heck yeah, Dave and Busters have got to be there.
3889522	3891023	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3892435	3893175	Hey, what's up?
3893416	3894176	Hi, who's this?
3895057	3895577	I'm Hitstun.
3895877	3897198	Hi, Hitstun, what's on your mind?
3898018	3901521	First time caller, long time listener, radio, whatever.
3902841	3904122	Am I breaking up to you guys?
3904622	3907464	You are breaking up a little bit, but go ahead and get your question out and we'll answer it.
3908685	3916890	I'm really questioning, I think I can explain this, video games, like, taking away the pain, like,
3918888	3922390	Like that article you guys are talking about on 1UP or whatever you found.
3923170	3933755	Alright, so when you're playing a video game, if you're focused enough on it, it has to be a certain type of video game in which you're constantly focused or else you're going to lose.
3934575	3937936	I mean, something like WarioWare would be most effective for it.
3938277	3941538	The game completely changes every five seconds.
3942218	3944379	If you're not totally focused on it, you're going to die.
3944639	3946000	And if you're focused on something else...
3946618	3949939	Thanks for the call.
3950059	3950399	Appreciate it.
3966063	3967125	What are they doing to me?
3987848	3990629	Alright, thank you guys so much for your calls on Skype.
3990649	3991709	We've got to keep it short tonight.
3991749	3995010	I'm very, very sorry, but we are so out of time, you guys.
3995590	3997870	But we do have one more thing for you guys.
3998130	4001151	How could we forget our newest segment here on Orange Lounge Radio?
4001731	4003832	DarkSakura's Website of the Week.
4006933	4008933	DarkSakura, what's the Website of the Week this week?
4009173	4011074	The Oregon Trail Online.
4011154	4011494	Rock.
4011654	4014574	I'm wearing my You Have Died of Dysentery shirt right now.
4014654	4015014	I saw it.
4015074	4015375	It's cute.
4015475	4015835	It's cute.
4018052	4022998	Just to read the first paragraph of this page, Remember the old Oregon Trail you used to play as a kid?
4023218	4028164	Well, we took the best part of the old Oregon Trail, the hunting, and turned it into the new age 3D hunting game.
4029145	4031708	Our game is packed with squirrels, deer, and buffalo.
4032229	4036874	The game contains changing scenery and moving clouds, and there's even a trade function so you can purchase more bullets.
4037786	4040627	Um, this was made with Macromedia Director 10.
4041467	4043647	The models were made using 3DS Max 5.1.
4043907	4045428	They actually put up all their stuff on there.
4045828	4047388	The textures were done in Photoshop 7.
4048669	4053070	Um, I actually, I think it's pretty cool that they put up what they did behind us.
4053130	4054990	It's just, you know, for fans of the game.
4055610	4058631	Honestly, I tried to play it and it was a little, eh, to me.
4059151	4065334	But I still think the concept is cool, and I'm glad that someone has recognized the importance of Oregon Trail to our gaming heritage.
4066235	4085144	This is located at, and I'm just going to read out the whole URL, woz.comtechlab.msu.edu slash courses slash 447SP04 slash Oregon Trail, all one word.
4086058	4089199	Post that in chat and post it on the forum so our listeners can find it immediately.
4089599	4090019	Super.
4091299	4091799	Good timing.
4091959	4093260	You timed that right at the end of the song.
4093640	4095000	That was great radio.
4095300	4095840	High five.
4095980	4096780	All right.
4097040	4098201	I'm not a radio loser.
4098221	4099281	We could do this for real.
4099361	4100041	Rock.
4101341	4101662	All right.
4101942	4102322	That's it.
4102342	4102942	That's the end of the show.
4102962	4103542	My gosh, you guys.
4103822	4106062	We did, I think, about three hours worth of show tonight.
4106082	4107943	Just under three hours worth of regular show.
4109763	4110263	Busy show.
4110323	4111064	Controversial show.
4111084	4111544	I need a cigarette.
4111604	4112784	We're going to get lots of emails.
4113693	4115074	But smoking's bad.
4115134	4115854	And I don't smoke.
4115914	4116314	That's right.
4116334	4117014	Alright, moving on.
4117054	4118495	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
4118795	4121916	Miklatov, thank you for being here, at least the small portion of the show you were here.
4122396	4122916	I appreciate it.
4123197	4123717	You're welcome.
4123737	4124377	Your final thought?
4124737	4125417	I don't have one.
4125917	4127078	Loki, your final thought?
4129114	4134817	I gotta get home to watch some ripped copies of the new Family Guy.
4135277	4136318	Hopefully a new Family Guy.
4136518	4137518	There better be a new Family Guy.
4138158	4142300	My final thought is, what is up with those World of Warcraft style Google Maps?
4142340	4144021	Some people have way too much free time on their hands.
4145081	4148423	DarkSakura, your final thought?
4148583	4153825	I have to go home and doctor my resume because I have an interview tomorrow.
4154025	4154706	Ooh, good luck with that.
4155046	4156146	And I'm a vegetarian now.
4156307	4160749	Warlord of the Universe is the position you're applying for, or what?
4160869	4162850	You know, I've been doing this job already.
4163070	4165351	I may as well have the official title, you know?
4166750	4168931	All right, that's it, you guys.
4168971	4172392	Thanks so much for tuning in and listening to us this week, and we'll be back next week.
4172812	4182014	Next week on the program, no special guests yet, but we are trying to get someone on the show next week, so I don't want to say who just yet, but we're trying to get someone very closely connected with the Silent Hill franchise.
4182394	4186195	We're excited to get that person on, so we'll see if we get that.
4186315	4187015	It's me!
4187035	4187655	No, it's not.
4187675	4188316	Oh, no, it's not.
4188416	4189036	All right, and...
4189827	4190247	That's it.
4190307	4197291	So stay tuned for that and of course all the controversy and humor that you've come to expect from your buddies here at Orange Lounge.
4197611	4199232	Until next week, have a good one.
