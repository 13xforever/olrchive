14148	18615	Tonight, January 22nd, 2006, is the Gizmondo and Mondo Trouble.
18956	24945	A new Silent Hill trailer hits the net and has everyone buzzing, and we talk about the worst reviewed video games of all time.
32330	34710	Welcome everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
34830	37271	This is episode number 171.
37851	44712	For this, January the 22nd, 2006, we're here to talk about video games and what gamers really want to know about.
44752	53334	And of course, you know our old catchphrase, the video games that don't suck, but sometimes we have to tell you about the ones that do suck just to tell you to stay away from them.
53894	54734	My name is Rob Roberts.
54754	55634	You might know me as Sky.
55694	58155	Joining me as always are my lovely co-hosts.
58635	60875	Say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
62481	63702	Oh, your mic's off, dear.
64242	65023	Now it isn't.
65183	65663	There we go.
66203	67144	I can't find the ferret.
67284	67744	Oh, there he is.
68124	69305	I've decided the name of the ferret.
69905	73707	Our mascot ferret, which we've had for the past three and a half years now that we've been doing a live show.
74468	75789	What are we calling the ferret?
76249	77149	Senor Burrito.
77350	78510	Why Senor Burrito?
79431	79791	Because.
80731	82292	Is that a chatroom influence thing?
82733	84233	No, his name is Senor Burrito.
84393	85694	Okay.
86475	89837	Don't mean to step on Senor Burrito over there.
91423	93964	Say hello to Senor Taco over there in the corner.
94044	94424	Loki!
94884	96164	I'm not Senor Taco.
96805	98245	I do not like tacos.
98745	99085	How are you?
99625	100846	Sorry, Senor McDonald's.
102066	103486	I don't know what this is.
103666	105507	It's not food, that's for sure.
106687	107948	That's why I don't feel bad eating it.
108208	111269	See, I can't get fat off of it because it's not actually food.
111329	113229	It's like toxic waste in buns.
113389	114730	Oh yeah, that will make your ass big.
114750	115650	That's for sure.
115670	118731	Don't you have a wedding to prepare for?
118751	118831	I am.
120836	121416	Game Over.
124157	126498	We're here taping live on this Sunday evening.
126558	135280	Of course, if you've been living in a cave and you missed last week's show, we do now tape our podcast live on Sunday nights to allow our listeners to interact with us.
135740	140201	And you can interact with us by heading on over to our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com.
140221	140922	Click on chat.
141282	144883	Or if you're listening taped on the podcast, you can always send us an email.
145423	149664	Our mailbag is mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
151106	151486	It's great.
151506	151946	Send us an email.
151966	153207	We'll get to the mailbag a little later.
153687	155127	But first, let's get to the games.
156628	158668	And talk about how our gaming weeks were.
158688	160109	Because that's how we start things off here.
160189	160669	DarkSakura.
161209	162189	Mine was special.
162929	163770	As in not very.
166050	170532	I actually went, made it to school this week.
170552	172392	Because I actually sort of started school.
173573	176653	And someone was in there playing puppies.
178134	178394	Playing...
179451	181532	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
206335	213737	Whatever happened to your friend that was like hardcore in Nintendogs that I met at your bachelorette party and she had like the Dalmatian and everything.
213958	214718	Oh, Melchon.
214818	215018	Yes.
215758	220200	I think she's still playing with her puppies, but she's Dan's assistant manager.
220580	222380	That game just got old, I'm sorry to say.
222400	224841	She's playing with the villagers too, with her village people.
226422	227562	Are they all doing the YMCA?
228084	231065	No, mine are doing the migrate out of DarkSakura's town right now.
231185	233025	Mine are doing the let's go pick weeds.
233365	240687	I'm actually harassing Limburg right now for all of his Japanese stuff in his house because I'm remaking the Shrine to Fire.
241447	244187	You know the best way to get people to move out of your town on Animal Crossing?
244788	245308	Leave a lot?
245508	246388	Don't talk to them.
246908	247148	Ever.
247528	249509	And then they leave because they feel ignored.
249829	250089	Good.
250349	256410	Isn't it sad that we're talking about a fake town on a fake video game?
257631	257831	No.
257991	260932	And yet, people have these real social interactions.
260972	261512	Okay, forget it.
262592	263352	Anything else to share?
263372	264832	No.
265032	265352	Loki.
266313	266893	Yes?
268133	269413	Your gaming week, you played anything?
269693	271314	Yes, I did play.
271334	273594	I actually got to play a little bit more of my 360.
273914	278355	I was playing Ridge Racer this morning, and I love that game.
279015	281175	It plays exactly like every other Ridge Racer game.
282056	283836	Probably because they haven't really changed much in it.
284315	287237	But it looks good, and I got through quite a bit.
287458	290860	I had to find the right car, you know, because each car kind of handles a little bit differently.
291381	297926	Then I finally found my right car for it, and now I'm kicking ass.
298786	303350	And I do like the fact they've had actually more downloads for it now, so there's more cars.
303730	309235	And I purchased some of the music that I liked from the other games, because you can download that as well, because it costs money.
309915	310216	Boo.
310576	310716	But
311192	311915	I did that anyways.
312537	317534	And I also played a little bit of Final Fantasy XI for the 360 because they have the beta now that you can get with
319613	325075	I was listening to other podcasts where folks were getting the Final Fantasy XI.
325095	327456	It was taking them like three hours to install it.
328056	329957	I had memories of the PC version.
330317	331457	Hey, guess what, guys?
331477	335538	Here's something you may not know for those of you that are getting on the 360 for the first time that weren't doing the PC.
335959	343461	Expect those three-hour patches like once every two months because they'll change something big in the game and then everybody tries to patch at the same time.
344415	350336	I have to say, I don't want to start a whole MMO debate, but World of Warcraft has their patching down.
350356	353757	The way they do it, because they use peer-to-peer to do it, it's smooth.
353937	356517	I've never had a patching problem on World of Warcraft, but Final Fantasy XI?
358038	359298	Nightmares.
360578	367780	The only thing that I would say that's pretty good about this is that the actual screens and the play-on-line stuff is really quick.
368540	369360	That's really quick.
370715	371996	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
399122	401923	Oh my gosh, they're going to letterbox it for regular TVs?
402303	403744	Yes, it's going to be letterboxed.
403804	408266	That chat dialogue is going to be horrible trying to read that stuff on a regular TV.
408646	413028	And you have to have to buy a USB keyboard in order to play this thing.
413328	415869	It's near impossible to play it without it.
416690	419211	But that's the same story with the PlayStation 2.
419271	420811	Does any old USB keyboard work?
421011	421832	Yeah, pretty much.
421852	422912	That's not going to be a problem for most people.
422932	424333	That's not a big problem, but...
425495	427858	The only thing, I tried playing it a little bit this morning.
428959	431742	I can't really level up at all because there's a ton of new people starting.
431902	436887	Remember, this is like an entirely brand new server that they're testing it on right now, so everybody's like level one.
437568	441672	It's like, imagine all the rabbits in the very beginning of the game.
442213	443094	Camp the hell.
443354	446177	I mean, there's like no way to get anything.
447199	449042	It kind of sucks.
449322	452366	So it's a brand new game for every region, right?
452486	458495	Because when Final Fantasy XI launched in the US, we were hooked up automatically with the Japanese servers.
458675	461118	Well, this is just a beta test server right now.
462060	462681	You know, and I...
463408	469090	When I first played Final Fantasy XI, I bought Final Fantasy XI on launch day for the PC when it first came out years ago.
469730	471671	And I don't remember that being a problem.
471711	476013	Of course, at the same time, I didn't know what the hell I was doing in that game because that game just kind of throws you into it.
476093	480795	It doesn't have a very excellent tutorial with it, so you just kind of have to jump in and get going.
481215	484356	And so I didn't even know to kill rabbits for a couple days.
484376	486997	Do you remember how long I was going through WTF mode in that game?
487137	487477	Oh, yeah.
487917	488998	I was like, I miss...
490445	491845	I miss Ragnarok already.
514861	516582	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
534730	535131	and DarkSakura.com.
548464	551126	And you're going to have to have Xbox Live and play online to play it.
551146	552888	So you're going to be paying two fees.
553148	553848	Not necessarily.
553889	556611	You only need silver to play this.
557111	559153	So you only have to really pay one fee.
559553	562115	But I'm already paying for Xbox Live Gold.
562375	564958	What the hell do I need to be paying another fee for?
566939	568841	Honestly, I'm not picking this up when this comes out.
568961	569822	I really don't care.
569902	572344	In the expansion, it's not going to be a big deal.
572964	576307	And what they've done with it so far, I thought this was supposed to be the...
577879	578679	Big huge thing.
578819	581120	Ooh, look, it's an MMO coming to the Xbox.
581220	582360	Ooh, it's going to be amazing.
582801	583781	I'm not amazed at all.
583921	586182	I'm not even impressed a little bit.
586822	592244	It looks just like a PC game, I mean the PC version, and it has not improved in any way whatsoever.
592784	605608	Now, do you think someone like me or someone like Jamie who has a widescreen HDTV of a larger size than any computer monitor sitting in their living room, do you think we might benefit from it a little more because we'll have a better...
606685	608086	Better visual to handle it.
608586	609486	I don't think so.
609747	611447	The textures, like I said, aren't improved.
611968	615309	If anything, it's going to be a little bit blurrier for you guys, but that's about it.
615890	617010	Remember what I say, though.
617690	618011	What's that?
618471	619391	It's all about the gameplay.
620132	623773	It's still Final Fantasy XI, and it still has crap for gameplay.
624994	628716	I don't want to sit here and bash XI totally, unlike Jamie, because it was a lot.
628756	630877	I played Final Fantasy XI for like two years, okay?
630897	635519	There's a lot to really like about the game, and I suppose that I can at least applaud...
636394	639416	I'd rather see, and as much as I really hate Phantasy Star Online, I'd rather see that on this.
659206	664710	I haven't even gotten far enough yet to see if there's any lag anywhere, but I'm not impressed and I'm not going to be picking it up when it comes out.
684986	686347	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
709471	709911	You can dream.
710692	717337	By the way, assuming all goes well, I should actually have my Kingdom Hearts very, very soon.
717657	718798	Are you importing the one from Japan?
719679	719959	Yes.
720320	720620	Sweet.
721821	722101	All right.
722862	724663	But I've also got my US one on pre-order.
725083	725323	Cool.
727105	729427	Anything else that you're playing this week, Loki?
730688	731288	Grand Theft Auto.
732009	734891	Lots of Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories because...
735953	736933	I just can't get enough of that game.
736973	738934	We've been playing all the deathmatches again.
739014	753038	We're actually kind of playing now with the cheat device a little bit because one of the things you can do with the cheat device is manipulate the gravity in the game and it'll actually, you can unload the cheat device and launch a multiplayer game with the gravity in place.
753698	761760	So I, for instance, could have like .1 gravity and other people could be, you know, having just normal gravity and I'll jump way the fuck over them.
762660	763181	So it's kind of fun.
764541	764681	Um...
765285	767066	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
785433	787015	Mega Man X4 was kind of cool.
787075	787635	Wait, no, I'm sorry.
787655	788096	5 and 6.
788376	788456	X4.
789217	790278	What was the last one?
790318	791820	X4 had the sucker in it.
791900	792540	Okay, I take it back.
792640	794142	X5 and X6 kind of sucked.
794422	796104	But then I'm like, well, X1 was kind of cool.
796144	798787	Do I really want to pay all this again just to play, you know, X1?
798807	799187	I don't know.
799247	805554	If you want to get Mega Man X1, get Mega Man Powered Up or Maverick Hunter X, the remake for the PSP.
806034	806675	That's like 20 bucks.
807356	807996	Is that out now?
808016	808797	I don't know.
809172	811673	I think it's coming out the first week in February
838632	839272	Battle and Chase
862788	863748	Maybe somebody in chat knows.
863789	867150	Speaking of chat, chat has some feedback to what we've been talking about so far.
868091	871052	For instance, Jaded2006 had a comment on Nintendogs.
871372	874794	Nintendogs died because nobody wanted another Pet Rock.
876835	877435	Kind of true there.
878796	879636	Another point here.
879916	882897	Somebody made a point on Phantasy Star Online.
883018	884418	I think it was Rini.
884778	890641	Rini said, Loki, don't forget, even Phantasy Star Online charges you per month as well on top of the Xbox Live fees.
890681	892442	At least the regular Xbox version does.
893376	897758	But that's the one good thing about this whole silver and gold thing that I see is that now we won't have that anymore.
897778	900039	Because that was my complaint about PSO on the Xbox too.
900439	903721	Which is too bad because PSO on the Xbox is my favorite version.
904441	907442	I did like the one on PC a whole lot, but Xbox had voice chat.
907462	907742	Come on.
909483	911924	I guess you could use team speak and stuff with a PC, but I don't know.
911944	914225	There's something about having it all streamlined.
914265	918267	I'm hoping that there's going to be an MMO coming out that's actually...
919042	922444	You know, when you pay for gold, it's basically the same fee.
923085	923865	It's applied to it.
924026	925687	So I don't have to pay these extra fees.
927568	929910	Alright, anyway, if you want to join our chatroom, moronsontrader.com, click on chat.
929950	943279	Speaking of MMOs, one other game I've been playing this week, a lot more World of Warcraft, because Miklatov, who was here on the show last week, convinced me to come back after my little hiatus, so I've been playing on his server, and I did our first instance.
943759	947882	Well, I think that's what you call it when you do the dungeon with party, but it's not high level.
947902	948603	We're only like level...
949195	952596	I think about 16, 17 and we're doing like a low level dungeon.
952636	954056	I think they call it an instance still.
954376	954536	Yeah.
954556	956476	Because it's like a harder quest.
956716	957616	It was actually a lot of fun.
957716	961797	Well, the reason they're called instances is because each dungeon is loaded up for just your party.
961937	962897	I thought so.
963537	968078	See, somebody was trying to tell me that was only in Guild Wars that that happened and that's true.
968138	978360	Guild Wars does that too but yeah, I realized that because none of the creatures were respawning when we were going through the dungeon and I was like maybe this is like just for us when we go through in that
979013	981034	I don't want to talk to those people
1002659	1005382	My roommate showed me how to block out the general chat.
1005442	1006923	GH, please.
1006983	1009466	No, in this one, they're all shouting for instances.
1009766	1012268	WC party, need healer.
1013029	1014310	RFC party, need healer.
1016392	1019055	So now everybody knows I'm horde on some server because those are horde quests.
1020396	1024080	Anyway, let's get into tonight's news, shall we?
1024807	1025027	Gizmondo
1038098	1055866	Well, it looks like Tiger Telematics, which is the parent company handling Gizmondo, stated that they've offered the stock IP and patents of SmartAds subsidiary as an equity on a $21.2 million loan from their shareholders.
1057066	1057806	Oopsie!
1057826	1059467	Uh-oh.
1059627	1061308	You mean the ad service wasn't a hit?
1062088	1073291	Okay, basically the terms of the deal, the loan that was overdue to be repaid, and also just for our UK listeners, that's 12.68 million pounds.
1074752	1075572	You know what this is like?
1076212	1081053	This is like friends of mine who have been in very bad financial situations that have to sell their car to pay the rent.
1081674	1082994	That's kind of what this sounds like to me.
1085809	1095715	The catch on this one is that the loan has to be repaid by March 30th unless Tiger can raise $75 million in new equity or debt by that date.
1097096	1099277	Then the company says it's working on securing that.
1100418	1110384	If it can get the $75 million, then $1.68 million of the loan must be repaid immediately and the remainder to come before June 30th.
1111565	1117269	and if the company doesn't get it or can't repaid it, the two shareholders will be taking over the smart ad system.
1118349	1119450	You know what could save this company?
1119690	1119890	What?
1120090	1121711	It's the same thing that saved other companies.
1122051	1122692	Side talking.
1125073	1128055	Did you have something additional in this?
1128155	1129256	No, I don't.
1129276	1132057	Nothing additional other than I'm not surprised.
1133418	1134719	They tried.
1134819	1135520	They really tried.
1135560	1136680	Why did the Gizmondo fail?
1137321	1139422	Why did the Betamax fail?
1141275	1146982	I think the Gizmondo failed because they didn't really have any big name games to kind of draw us to the system.
1147002	1149666	You know, the system's only as good as the games that are on it, right?
1149746	1153151	And we saw this one game, Johnny, whatever, that looked, you know, whatever.
1153211	1153711	It looked okay.
1154072	1156595	But there was no big draw.
1156615	1158198	But it wasn't a big draw, you know what I mean?
1158778	1165943	and I never once, walking into a large store like Best Buy, Fry's, never once have I seen a setup for Gizmondo.
1166003	1172007	Well, Gizmondo, the problem with it also was the games that were launching on it were last generation games.
1173328	1178652	Also, they had this wonderful ad service in there where you have to watch ads in order to shut your system off.
1178672	1179552	Oh, I remember that.
1179592	1180213	Oh, that's fun.
1180473	1184656	And also possibly talking about a redesign of the system before the system launches.
1184836	1185817	Well, that's a great idea.
1185857	1187238	That'll get people to buy your system.
1187258	1187798	Yeah.
1189850	1190171	All right.
1191151	1194332	Well, I guess... At least their system came out.
1194372	1197053	That's more than we could say about the... About the Phantom?
1197293	1197893	Exactly.
1198553	1201654	Well, it's not over till it's over, but, you know, it's over.
1204255	1205315	Moving on, other stories.
1205335	1216719	I have a story here about the 9th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, because, you know, it's awards season, and there's, you know, this group, the Interactive Achievement Awards, they're handing out awards, and...
1217443	1219103	Here's what's nominated for Game of the Year.
1219223	1226125	God of War, Guitar Hero, Shadow of the Colossus, Call of Duty 2, and Nintendogs.
1226785	1228426	You know what else is missing from this list?
1230026	1232507	Resident Evil 4, which is getting a lot of awards.
1232787	1233547	So it's kind of interesting.
1233767	1238708	And I don't know, maybe it missed the eligibility point or something because Resident Evil 4 came out really, really early in 2005.
1238868	1241849	So maybe it just narrowly missed some type of eligibility window.
1241869	1242169	I don't know.
1242763	1249629	Computer Games nominated, Fear, Civilization 4, Battlefield 2, Age of Empires 3, and the movies.
1250369	1252531	Just a whole, whole lot of categories here.
1252551	1254092	I'm obviously not going to sit here and read them all.
1254412	1257314	But I thought it was interesting because they have a cellular game of the year.
1257675	1260597	And nobody really ever talks about cell phone games because most of them suck.
1261778	1265281	But if you want to, you know, this might clue you into what a couple of the good ones are.
1265661	1272146	Mile High Pinball, Skipping Stone, 1, Ancient Empires 2, and High Seas.
1272628	1274810	None of which I've ever heard of on my cell phone.
1274830	1278653	But I have Sprint, and they have, like, different games than the other people, I think.
1278793	1279714	I always delete them.
1279954	1281875	I, like, have Bejeweled on my phone or something.
1282155	1284818	I had Bejeweled multiplayer for a little while, and it was all right.
1285438	1295206	I had Castlevania on the cell phone, which was cool for, like, five minutes, because it was like, dude, it's just like Castlevania 1, but then you realize I'm trying to play a game on my cell phone, and the action is, like, so choppy.
1295686	1296567	It's pretty bad.
1297968	1301451	It's one of those things, like, I got this to listen to the theme music once in a while.
1301631	1301931	I don't know.
1303018	1303479	I don't know what else
1323553	1324854	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1343410	1346511	Probably making sure they have enough units out there and maybe launching on time for everyone.
1347171	1353133	You know what's interesting is that I seem to remember that was a big part of their talk behind that controller.
1353213	1360575	When they first showed the pictures of the Revolution controller, they were like, hey, everybody's used a TV remote, so this makes it kind of accessible to everybody.
1360816	1361256	Exactly.
1361596	1362356	Interesting argument.
1362416	1368478	Yeah, that way it's so anybody, you know, your grandma can go pick up this game and figure out how to do this, okay?
1368919	1369640	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1397564	1403927	And that's how they think they're going to win the next-gen... Did he say anything about actually putting out Twilight Princess this year?
1403987	1405387	That should be one of their goals, I think.
1406448	1409329	Have you noticed all has been kind of quiet on the Twilight Princess front?
1409709	1410990	I don't know if that's just... It's still coming out.
1411010	1412950	We're still kind of... Because we're in a quiet period right now.
1412990	1414471	It's kind of a slow news period right now.
1415371	1415812	But I don't know.
1415852	1416412	It's just... What?
1416452	1417272	Well, you're laughing over there.
1417292	1418673	I'm laughing at the book reference.
1419053	1419153	Oh.
1420674	1421494	I had to read that.
1422142	1434128	Anyway, but no, I think that at the point that they start being very quiet about something that either means one of two things, something is going very well or something is going horrendously wrong.
1434508	1438130	What do you think is the case in the PlayStation 3, which has also been very, very quiet lately?
1438290	1438970	Horribly wrong.
1439910	1445293	I've got theories on this one, but my comments on that are coming up on later issues.
1445433	1445873	All right, fine.
1446313	1449775	My thing is I think they're starting to get towards the end here.
1450368	1476092	they're starting to get towards their dates that they said that they were going to hit and they're nowhere near hitting those dates and I think that it's a bad sign right now seeing as that none of the actual alpha kits have gone out for the PS3 and so far we haven't yet to see an actual playable demo or anything that's actually running well we've seen some demos running on the hardware but nothing playable and the fact that
1476833	1477874	The beta kits aren't even out.
1478194	1479596	This thing's nowhere near production.
1479776	1480777	No one knows what the cost is.
1480857	1481878	No one knows when it's coming out.
1482398	1484340	I'm not even sure it's coming out this year.
1485502	1487884	Interesting feedback here from SSJ100 Matt.
1487924	1489626	Nintendo's stocks are up 6%.
1490386	1498813	And I do remember reading an article on this is that after there was that big spiel about Nintendo, the revolution will not be above this price, the stocks went up.
1499114	1500775	I remember reading somewhere on the internet.
1500955	1504378	I don't think the story made the cut for tonight, but I remember seeing that somewhere on the internet.
1504398	1505459	I thought that was kind of neat.
1505539	1511764	I'm not sure if they're going to be able to do under $299, but let's just say they do $199, that thing's going to fly off shelves.
1511964	1512545	It's going to be...
1513382	1514103	Thanks for watching!
1534278	1534698	Speculation
1555848	1557229	and so on.
1576503	1578105	A Nintendo DS game is usually about $35.
1578925	1581388	I'd say about $35 is as high as I've seen it, too.
1581588	1585872	I think that's what I paid for... Oh, hell.
1587853	1588234	Kirby!
1588894	1591697	Oh, not Kirby, because that was a present.
1591777	1592798	I know there's something I bought that was $35.
1593218	1595420	I'd probably touch and go when I first bought it.
1595760	1596641	That's why I got it confused.
1596661	1597442	It's the same game.
1597462	1598703	It's just Kirby's a lot better.
1599704	1599864	Yeah.
1600425	1600665	Anyway.
1601325	1601786	Moving on.
1602896	1604858	Now, a follow-up to something we talked about last week.
1604898	1610761	We talked about this Nintendo DS redesign was on the way, and there's going to be this whole great announcement on Monday.
1610781	1611841	And then what happened, Loki?
1612022	1613082	What happened on Monday?
1613162	1615083	The only announcement was that there's not a redesign.
1615103	1618685	Of course, they didn't say there wasn't going to be a redesign, so... Ever.
1618725	1620226	They didn't say there wasn't going to be a redesign, ever.
1620286	1627330	They basically said, we have no news to... Basically, our system is awesome.
1627390	1630332	We have no news regarding redesigns.
1631445	1633507	It says, but we have nothing to announce at this time.
1633967	1635788	Nothing to announce at this time.
1635848	1639710	That's the key word, meaning that there is going to be a redesign, just not right now.
1639790	1641471	Probably something that they'll save for E3 or...
1643372	1644373	There is going to be a redesign.
1644553	1647255	Nintendo cannot stand to leave something alone.
1647275	1648977	There's always going to be a redesign.
1649297	1649677	You know what?
1649717	1654861	I've seen great, great arguments out there on the internet, though, when people were debunking this.
1654881	1657964	It's like, you know, if it's not broke, why fix it?
1658064	1659785	DSs are still selling like hell.
1659865	1667972	And somebody else sent me an article that also didn't make the cut for tonight, but talking about how the Japanese are really, really pushing to get DSs back on shelves.
1667992	1672215	They're even importing them back in the country and just crazy stuff, you know.
1672893	1674173	So if it's not broke, why fix it?
1674313	1678495	They won't need to put out a new DS until DS sales slow down.
1679035	1683496	Which, as long as they keep putting out really solid games for it, probably isn't going to happen anytime soon.
1683516	1688037	With Tetris DS right around the corner, I think that's going to be a big motivator for more systems.
1688558	1692619	All they would have to do to make more of those systems fly off the shelves, shoot, do another $20 price cut.
1693179	1698660	Tetris DS and you also have the same month is going to be Metroid Prime Hunters.
1698681	1700241	It's going to be a huge month for DS.
1701246	1702646	And what's PSP got on the horizon?
1702886	1703967	What's PSP have?
1704467	1706427	They have the new Splinter Cell Essentials.
1706627	1707648	Katamari Damacy, I suppose.
1708048	1709568	Katamari's coming out in March.
1710549	1718711	They've got a new... I'm trying to think if there's anything else that was really... They have a lot of... There's 29 games for the PSP coming out in March.
1719051	1720471	So, I mean, that's a lot of stuff.
1721892	1727713	But... You know, speaking of DS, it's not on the outline for tonight's show, but you had something about Phoenix Wright.
1728573	1728813	Yeah.
1728833	1729274	The DS game.
1729294	1729974	What happened with this?
1730414	1730654	Another...
1731240	1732321	Too popular for its own good?
1732521	1734082	It is too popular for its own good.
1734222	1740147	And unfortunately, if you don't have one right now and there are none in your local store, you're not going to be seeing it until March.
1740707	1745171	Because, like most Japanese games, they get produced in Japan.
1745291	1750355	It's going to be a six-week turnaround time because Capcom is sold out of them right now.
1750855	1754798	And no way you can get one until March.
1755639	1755839	Wow.
1756199	1757581	Yeah, February, March-ish.
1758341	1759002	Wow, wow, wow.
1759022	1759122	Crazy.
1759162	1759382	Crazy.
1760000	1760300	All right.
1760580	1764081	Well, enough about what's going on in Japan and over here in the U.S.
1764121	1765902	How about our buddies over in the U.K.?
1766022	1772844	DarkSakura likes to keep tabs on what's going on overseas the other way and fills us in with the U.K.
1772904	1773284	report.
1774125	1778886	Well, we actually have an update that the U.K.
1779406	1780827	DS sales reached $1 million.
1782580	1791167	They have surpassed that 1 million unit sale, which is pretty big since it's been out less than a year over there.
1794450	1802837	They said that several of the major retailers in the UK were completely sold out of the systems too, and so people have to wait for quite a while.
1803878	1808882	Worldwide sales are a good bit higher than 13 million now.
1810834	1813658	Wow, Nintendo just knows how to do their handhelds.
1813718	1814198	What can you say?
1814859	1815740	They are the pros.
1817442	1821507	Also, Dead or Alive 4 has a UK release date.
1822048	1825472	They said it will ship on January 27th.
1825613	1828136	For those of you guys that need your boobie fix, it's on its way.
1829300	1836006	I warn you, the whole reaction system in that, that game's a pain in the ass.
1836206	1837407	Really?
1837807	1840069	The last boss is the biggest cheese ball in the universe.
1840570	1843492	I'd like to mention something real quick about DOA 4 that makes no sense to me.
1843752	1855142	I was playing that game, and there was one cutscene that they have where one of the female characters is trying to buy a head of lettuce, and this other female character
1856533	1860555	Who seemed to be of royalty or something, took the lettuce away from her, and then they fought.
1861255	1863096	What the hell is that for a story?
1863376	1865476	They're fighting over a goddamn head of lettuce.
1865817	1866917	That was so retarded.
1867117	1870038	And by the way, their boobs pout way too much in this game still.
1870178	1871199	On the next Jerry Springer.
1871939	1873439	No, you have to set the age.
1873479	1876020	We've got the age set to 30, I think.
1876941	1877821	Because of Dan.
1878746	1879366	Bouncy Boobies
1903382	1905463	So your age determines the bounce.
1905584	1906984	That's weird.
1907525	1910307	Anything else in the U.K.?
1910747	1913469	Yes, actually, a game I'm actually pretty excited about.
1913529	1921875	In fact, I might be doing something regarding a translation of this game for the U.S., but that's another story.
1922735	1929740	Tales of Phantasia, a Japanese RPG, is going to be out on the Game Boy in March in the U.K.,
1930876	1937245	And I'm actually pretty excited about that game because Tales of Phantasia has a pretty unique battle system.
1938047	1940790	I've seen a bit of it in action, the Japanese version.
1940831	1941792	Pretty cool intro, too.
1942453	1942633	But...
1945025	1947667	It was out on the Super Famicom back in the day.
1948047	1950689	And of course, was it Tales of Symphonia?
1951770	1958996	And another game, one on PlayStation 2 and the other on GameCube, came out in the United States, but we never did see Tales of Fantasia.
1961117	1965100	So I think it's pretty exciting that there's going to be a release for that on the Game Boy Advance.
1965561	1967242	And of course, it's going to be out in Europe at the end of March.
1967702	1968123	Very cool.
1968423	1971505	And in the United States sometime beginning of March.
1972086	1972386	Very cool.
1973663	1975364	All right, thank you for that, DarkSakura.
1975524	1976144	You're quite welcome.
1976504	1978044	Our folks overseas appreciate you.
1978645	1979105	They better.
1979325	1980085	They better appreciate you, too.
1980105	1980585	I mean, I love you guys.
1981125	1981385	All right.
1982086	1989028	You know, interesting comment here in the chat room, summing up the Dead or Alive 4 story that Loki was telling us about.
1989348	1991969	DarkTetsuya says, DOA 4 has a story?
1993229	1995910	Which I think perfectly sums it up right there.
1996030	1998731	It's all about John Lee's ending, which is hilarious.
2000714	2001355	Blink, Blink, Blink
2013493	2013853	Dr. Sudoku 3x3 Box
2034908	2036389	It's this huge puzzle craze.
2036669	2042191	So, of course, they think, hmm, puzzle, Game Boy Advance, Tetris, best-selling game.
2042511	2044252	Well, shit, we need to put Sudoku out there.
2044352	2047353	So, Dr. Sudoku is coming out in February.
2047413	2049874	It's got more than 1,000 puzzles.
2050494	2060658	And, of course, will be the first of many, many Sudoku games to hit various game systems, just like Tetris, just like World Championship poker games and all that stuff.
2061779	2062339	What do you think?
2062959	2064260	Next big thing, or...
2064895	2065755	Just whatever.
2066476	2068437	Maybe if I ignore it, it'll go away.
2069497	2070157	You know what's interesting?
2070517	2077580	I don't understand the sudden interest in Sudoku because these puzzle books that they've sold in stores... I remember these from when I was younger.
2078121	2084743	I was such a nerd that my parents could buy me one of these books and we would go on a road trip and I'd shut up for a long time.
2085364	2085464	And...
2086681	2089683	These Sudoku puzzles appeared in the books.
2089723	2093064	I want to say it's like Penny Press or somebody puts out these books.
2093144	2094105	You can get them in supermarkets.
2094445	2097867	These Sudoku puzzles appeared in these books a long time ago except they were called something else.
2097887	2099227	That's something with a more English title.
2099307	2102409	It was like crypto numbers or something was like the name of the puzzles.
2103009	2105751	And why now is this stuff all the rage?
2105791	2107131	That's what I'm not getting.
2107231	2108252	People are trend whores.
2108932	2111253	I guess, but it's just really weird.
2111713	2114134	And I'll admit, I've done a couple Sudoku puzzles.
2114834	2119415	Recently I was in a waiting room for a long time and I was like, there's the New York Times, and I was like, oh, Sudoku.
2120376	2121076	I'll do the puzzle there.
2123117	2123557	But I don't know.
2123797	2126478	I can't see myself spending money to buy this on Game Boy Advance.
2126998	2131219	I do think its popularity is a good thing because it's something that encourages people to actually use their brains.
2132419	2133200	True, true.
2134040	2135140	But, you know, I don't know.
2136301	2137061	Also, to me...
2137927	2142931	Game Boy Advance wouldn't match for me just the pen and paper version of doing it, you know?
2143792	2145774	Imagine that, having fun with pen and paper.
2146814	2150938	I know it's a strange concept for some gamer folks, but, you know, go figure.
2152739	2156823	Well, you know, there are people who have actually forgotten how to write from typing so much.
2157523	2157743	Hmm.
2158404	2166170	It actually is a sort of epidemic thing in Japan where people have forgotten how to write certain kanji because when you type, you can select it from a list.
2166791	2166911	Hmm.
2168925	2169485	Interesting comment.
2169505	2171787	I'm reading chat room for some comments on Sudoku.
2172628	2175330	Rini says that Dr. Sudoku will be a battery drainer.
2176471	2176871	Let's see.
2178712	2182315	Ninst says it's the rage now because someone slapped a foreign word on it.
2182395	2183216	So yes, whores.
2183596	2184857	And Xander C has the same thing.
2185137	2187519	It's popular now because it has the Japanese name now.
2187859	2191702	And then, of course, WonderDogHerald says they should have a Pokemon Sudoku game.
2193584	2195025	That's how they sold Tetris Attack.
2196258	2201220	Nobody bought Tetris Attack when it was, well, a couple of people did, but not a lot of people bought Tetris Attack when it was first out and had Yoshi and stuff.
2201500	2205182	Slap some Pokemon characters on it, put it on the N64, Pokemon Puzzle League.
2205282	2209304	Is that why Tetris DS has the Retro Mario and Zelda characters in it?
2210464	2210885	Probably.
2211425	2211825	Probably.
2212365	2216587	And then, of course, we have VXJasonXV, our lovely webmaster.
2216607	2217047	We love him.
2217087	2219108	And chat says, you can't erase paper.
2219788	2220769	Get an eraser mate.
2220809	2222029	Get one of those eraser mate pens.
2222229	2223110	You can't erase paper.
2223922	2225543	Loki, what's going on in the movie world?
2225563	2226843	We have, uh...
2242916	2244177	Oh my god, House of the Dead 2?
2245138	2245278	Yes.
2245298	2246519	They're making a House of the Dead 2?
2247139	2248660	That was exactly my reaction.
2248680	2249701	Dear God, why?
2250141	2257266	When I saw it on our list of movies, you know, upcoming movies, I was like, why the hell would they make a sequel to that?
2257366	2259207	Didn't they lose enough money on the first one?
2259267	2260548	And it's not Yui Bol this time.
2260628	2261329	It's not Yui Bol.
2261389	2262089	So it might be good.
2262589	2262790	I know.
2262810	2265011	It might be that rare sequel that's better than the original.
2265351	2269554	You have to remember, it's not just the director that ruins a movie, okay?
2269914	2271596	You have the same writers as the...
2273350	2275291	All in the Dark, and House of the Dead in this one.
2275571	2281133	What's also scary is these same writers are doing a Dead or Alive movie, as if you couldn't tell that one was going to suck.
2282554	2290597	Now, what's great, though, is this movie, it says it picks up where the last film left off, where the government operatives investigate the island and the mysterious house.
2291537	2296179	So, in other words, the first game, because the last one was a prequel to
2296846	2297306	Everything.
2297606	2301448	So is that like Jurassic Park 2 when they went back to the island to research the dinosaurs?
2301488	2302028	I don't know.
2302268	2305469	Are they going to whip out keyboards and have letters pop up in front of the zombies?
2305569	2307010	Is Julianne Moore going to be in it?
2307490	2311152	No, not Julianne Moore, but you have Sticky Fingers is going to be in it.
2311172	2311652	Oh, God.
2313146	2315668	I just hope it has some of the cheeseball dialogue that was in the game.
2315989	2317430	There was nothing we could do.
2317450	2318852	Let me put it this way, folks.
2319732	2321734	Do not buy this when it comes out on DVD.
2321774	2325858	Instead, you can watch it for free when it premieres on SyFy on February 11th.
2325898	2327980	Yeah, but it won't have titty on SyFy.
2328000	2329642	Oh, it's not going to have titty anyways, probably.
2331303	2332084	Oh, actually, no.
2332524	2333686	Nudity and brief sexuality.
2334566	2337769	No nudity in the SyFy version, but really, are you missing anything?
2337850	2338250	No, you're not.
2338846	2341448	But it might be one of those movies that's so bad it's good.
2342028	2343810	Like Blood Rain?
2344410	2346812	Like Showgirls, one of my favorite movies of all time.
2347272	2349093	So bad, it's good.
2349994	2354077	And if you watch it on VH1, it's even worse because they draw the bras on and everything.
2354417	2356839	I love Showgirls because it's so, so bad.
2357539	2358860	Anyways, you don't know shit.
2359240	2361422	If you are masochist when it comes to actually...
2363343	2364524	You're watching these movies.
2364564	2373327	The DVD will be released in the United States on March 21st, as well as also debuting on Sci-Fi Channel on February 11th.
2373407	2374488	So, check it out.
2374768	2376469	Well, let me set my TiVo now.
2377769	2379570	Let's talk about a more promising movie, shall we?
2380365	2382486	Let's talk about Silent Hill.
2382506	2387367	The trailer hit the internet this week and it's getting really good reaction.
2387427	2388768	I've already made two icons from it.
2389668	2394250	Have you seen the Silent Hill website now is updated and changed?
2394310	2395570	It looks awesome.
2395590	2402573	They did this whole flash thing with it where it looks all nice at first and it goes creepy on you all of a sudden and they got cool backdrops and stuff.
2402613	2403853	It's welcome to SilentHill.com.
2404133	2405614	Did you guys all watch the trailer?
2405974	2406134	Yes.
2406154	2406714	What did you think?
2406994	2408655	Yes, I did as I made two icons out of it.
2409175	2409675	I had to ask.
2409895	2411017	Pyramid Head
2423639	2428921	It's great because it seems like it really is going to be a great video game adaptation.
2428961	2430562	These guys paid attention to the games.
2430942	2441786	And granted, the story's a lot different, but we kind of have the characters from Silent Hill 1 in a way, some of that, or the ambience of Silent Hill 1 and the music.
2442086	2446387	We have a lot of the characters from Silent Hill 2, and then kind of the look of Silent Hill 3.
2446908	2450929	Towards the end of the trailer, it looks a lot like Silent Hill 3, so it's kind of got all of that.
2451434	2479428	no signs of Silent Hill 4 but I suppose they want to leave room for a sequel or something who knows but the cool thing I thought about the trailer was that they used music from the games in the trailer and we heard that you know Akira was going to do Akira Yamaoka was going to do the soundtrack then he wasn't then some other guy was going to do it and it was going to be inspired by Akira Yamaoka's original score so I don't know if this is some of the score that's actually going to be in the movie but this is it this is great because somebody just basically re-recorded what Akira Yamaoka did it's awesome it fits the trailer very well
2480370	2485379	He said he was going to be using elements from the original, so I think that's more where we got a lot of that from.
2485941	2490489	Well, usually I don't run out to go see these movies, but this one's actually one I'm looking forward to.
2490970	2493014	The trailer's a little eh.
2493653	2497036	But, you know, as far as the way they did it, it makes it a little cheesy.
2497356	2498337	But it looks good.
2498457	2504801	And especially if you watch the teaser, you know, the way they did the teaser trailer, it's really, you know... The teaser was awesome.
2504981	2505762	That was awesome.
2505922	2508044	That had, like, the total style of Silent Hill and everything.
2508204	2513648	And especially towards the end of the trailer when they show Pyramid Head again, you know, it's going to be just awesome.
2514888	2519312	I'm scared I'm going to be really let down because my expectations now are so, so, so high for this movie.
2519652	2521493	I'm really scared I'm going to get let down by it.
2521994	2522254	I think...
2522974	2526357	It's one of those films, at some point they're going to have to be good.
2526538	2527659	They're going to have to start being good.
2527719	2535886	And I think what people need is a movie to set the bar so that people will stop going to see these piece of crap movies that Webull puts out.
2535966	2543593	Because they're really bad and they need to have some people out there go, you know what, this is what a video game movie should look like.
2543713	2545274	I'm not paying to see this crap.
2545334	2546936	Stop putting this crap out.
2547016	2548097	Talk to these studios.
2548117	2549138	That's what they need to be doing.
2549629	2562895	I honestly, I would have to say, because they would have to, to get that degree of accuracy and to keep the story that far in line, they'd have to be working fairly close with the creating team out of Konami.
2563055	2566756	Well, you know the Konami logo shows up at the end of the trailer, so that was kind of cool.
2567576	2571278	I mean, I suppose that's a property rights thing anyway, but, you know, still promising.
2571338	2577260	That also offers hope, though, that if Konami is getting in on that and making it so good, you know?
2577361	2578421	That they won't fuck up Metal Gear?
2580715	2582317	I want so bad for a Metal Gear movie.
2582337	2585480	I think that in this case I really pray that his reputation is heated.
2585500	2585700	We'll see.
2597134	2598194	Alright, moving on.
2598755	2603876	Now, you know, there's lots of things that lazy people do, and one of them is watching a lot of movies.
2604596	2606437	One of them could be playing a lot of games.
2606557	2613659	In fact, one of these folks who lost a lot of weight recently has been in the media, says that games made him fat.
2613739	2614219	Right, Loki?
2614659	2615339	What's going on with this?
2616199	2620761	Well, Jared, he was apparently a big Nintendo fan.
2620781	2622141	Wait, Jared, like the Subway guy?
2622421	2622781	Yeah.
2623001	2623902	Oh, okay, that guy.
2624502	2625042	Yeah, he...
2625475	2626336	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2643587	2646850	I don't think Nintendo is the sole thing to blame here, obviously.
2646870	2653474	He needs to be blaming himself for not getting his ass up off the couch and going outside and exercising.
2653815	2655056	He has himself to blame.
2655136	2657517	And trust me, I've lost 80 pounds.
2659179	2664723	I know that what it took for me was getting my ass up off from in front of the TV and going and working out and eating right.
2665043	2667064	He had to have done the same thing, right?
2667785	2669226	He says he had, you know,
2670393	2673634	One hand on the controller, one hand in a bag of chips.
2674435	2675895	So we know who we need to be coming after.
2676295	2676956	Potato chips!
2677096	2678556	They're the root of all evil.
2678716	2683078	He needs to take responsibility for himself and blame it on his own personal weakness.
2683778	2686999	People themselves are responsible for their own health.
2687840	2689880	Okay, here, devil's advocate for a minute.
2690421	2692481	Is Nintendo an enabler?
2692822	2693882	Or video games in general?
2694342	2695202	It was still his choice.
2695383	2695963	It was just there.
2696543	2699044	It's the same thing as sitting and watching pay-per-view all day.
2700164	2713433	Video games in that regard are no different from sitting on the couch watching pay-per-view, wrestling, porn, internet, chat rooms.
2714553	2715374	It's all the same.
2715854	2729223	It was his choice to sit and play the game, and it was his choice to eat potato chips, and then, to his credit, he made the decision to do something different.
2730137	2735319	He decided one day to get up and eat something better, even if it was Subway.
2735440	2737280	God, Togo's is so much better.
2738461	2739602	I'm a Quiznos fan, but anyway.
2739822	2745344	But he made the decision to put some effort and take responsibility for himself.
2745464	2751247	To him, go back and blame Nintendo for his obesity?
2752127	2752928	Just completely...
2754248	2756210	Cast a big shadow over all of what he's done.
2756290	2761553	At the same time though, is the gamer community taking this one little quote and blowing it completely out of context?
2761634	2762234	I think it is.
2762254	2763815	I think it's just a spin on the story.
2763855	2768018	I'm sure it's probably something like, you know, I used to sit around playing my Nintendo.
2768538	2773262	I think he was just probably trying to point out that he was lazy and eating, you know, he wasn't eating right.
2773542	2776604	and someone's like, oh, he said Nintendo, oh, it's all their fault.
2776964	2778725	I'm kind of seeing it a little bit like that, too.
2778765	2789171	I mean, we can kind of poke fun, but in a realistic way is that, you know what, use Jared as an example that, you know, if you are feeling fat, you should put down the controller and go walk.
2789191	2794434	Because he said, he says that it's not just Subway that made him thinner, it was getting up and walking, going on walks.
2794694	2798815	I need to actually quote Legend of Zaku here because I fully believe this.
2799115	2800315	Big happy quote for me.
2801475	2805616	America, the land that personal responsibility forgot.
2807936	2816278	You know, it says though, since he was almost 425 pounds, he would have been about 600 pounds though if he were playing World of Warcraft instead of Nintendo.
2816458	2818938	I know, just think about if they had World of Warcraft back then.
2819038	2822439	Alright, moving on.
2822819	2823299	He'd be dead.
2825123	2833786	Real quick, how much gaming is too much and how can you prevent yourself from being 400 pounds overweight like Jared?
2834006	2836988	Or whatever he was, I'm sorry, I'm probably grossly over-exaggerating.
2837008	2840729	But how can you prevent yourself from being that overweight?
2841449	2844750	Well, you know I was on my way there, unfortunately.
2844770	2848992	I moved out here from Alabama and put on something like...
2850632	2858657	Well, actually, I'm now under what I weighed when I moved out here, but I did put on something like 70 pounds.
2860038	2861439	Because Dan and I are both gamers.
2861459	2863981	We sat around playing Street Fighter all day.
2864381	2864882	Seriously.
2864942	2865962	I mean, I'm not joking.
2865982	2868024	It was that or Castlevania, Symphony of the Night.
2868964	2875569	And I finally hit my saturation point in 2003 and said, you know, I can't go on this way anymore.
2875589	2875609	I...
2877683	2880444	Right then and there, I didn't consider it a diet.
2880524	2881684	I made a lifestyle change.
2882365	2886726	You have to incorporate little changes into your life and make them habit.
2887807	2888667	Go outside the game.
2889167	2889607	Exactly.
2890027	2892328	What you do... I played DDR for a while.
2892348	2893108	DDR was helpful.
2893168	2893889	It was exercise.
2893929	2895089	It was fun and exercise.
2895449	2896790	But I learned to like going to the gym.
2897190	2898370	I got involved in classes.
2898530	2902392	I worked out with my friends who were also... It's good to have a friend who has the same goals as you.
2903192	2903352	But...
2903965	2904505	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
2928908	2929909	It was quite interesting.
2930229	2936976	Before, I used to play Final Fantasy 3 and stuff, really long RPGs, and I wouldn't really get out and do anything.
2937016	2940019	Then I went and played actual QZAR, and that was a lot of exercise and stuff.
2940280	2945885	Then I stopped playing QZAR to play Final Fantasy 7 and 10 and stuff, and I got really lazy again.
2945966	2950270	Then DDR came out, and I started playing a lot of DDR, and that got me back to exercising.
2950330	2952312	Then Final Fantasy 11 came around, and I stopped.
2953203	2957624	DDR is a great revolution in games, but at the same time it's not the magic weight loss program.
2958304	2959885	You can't just play DDR and expect to drop 50 pounds.
2974834	2977816	I think, kind of like Jamie said, it's got to be a bit of a lifestyle change, too.
2977836	2979656	You can't just play DDR for 15 minutes a day.
2979937	2988301	It'll help, and you'll get some exercise, but you're not going to really, it's not going to be like this magic, just watch the fat fly, you know, it's different.
2988321	2992963	Now, if you're doing what I was doing and playing DDR for an hour and a half every day...
2994755	2997096	You remember when I got mine on Dreamcast back when?
2997536	3001537	I was playing DDR daily for an hour trying to beat the harder stuff.
3002117	3005458	And it was that challenging myself is what kept me going.
3005718	3008338	Finding personal satisfaction in the competitive side of it.
3008498	3010959	Let me use a real life scenario to kind of illustrate what I'm saying here.
3011499	3014560	Sometimes me in a group and sometimes you guys would go and what have you.
3014580	3014980	It just depends.
3015000	3019101	We used to go out every Wednesday and we'd meet up at the arcade for DDR and whatever else.
3019541	3028203	and then after we were done, we would go to Brookfields and dine on cheese sticks and soda and soup that's really high in fat and stuff.
3028483	3035865	See, that's what I'm saying is that there was no change there because you go play DDR and it's like, damn, that game made me hungry.
3035885	3039026	I'm going to eat a whole basket of cheese sticks by myself.
3039668	3042149	I actually did lose weight when we were doing that regularly.
3042330	3042610	Really?
3042770	3044711	But you weren't ordering the same stuff, were you?
3044891	3053196	Well, no, but then again, that was when I was also doing my I think I'm going to be a vegetarian now shtick, and then I went back to eating meat in 2003.
3053236	3055297	Yeah, I did the vegetarian thing for two weeks, too.
3055517	3060120	And now my body's forcing me into being a vegetarian, but that's just because of my antibiotics.
3061380	3062341	All right, new subject, new subject.
3062361	3063161	We've got to keep it moving here.
3063181	3064862	We still have a lot we want to cover here before we get a break.
3066103	3067484	Starting with...
3068294	3068756	Kojima.
3069117	3069659	You know Kojima.
3069679	3071023	He's the guy that does Metal Gear.
3071184	3071986	Hide-chan.
3072167	3072548	That's right.
3073030	3073692	He has...
3074443	3075744	This kind of podcast thing going on.
3075784	3087309	Those of you guys that are into the podcasting thing might get a kick out of this, is that there's actually a podcast show that he's doing, and he even incorporates Solid Snake into it, which is kind of silly, but whatever.
3087829	3094172	It's over on Hideo Kojima's blog, which is www.blog.konami.jp.
3095433	3097814	I'm sorry, slash GS slash Hideo blog.
3097834	3098134	You know what?
3098174	3099815	Just go to blog.konami.jp.
3099835	3100295	You'll find it.
3100555	3102117	and it's also now in English as well.
3102477	3107662	You can find his own podcast show and it's called Hidechan Radio.
3108503	3109464	But it's not in English.
3110545	3115350	So you have to kind of understand at least a little bit of Japanese unless you just want to listen to Japanese talk.
3115370	3119714	Like if you're into anime and you're just listening to sexy Japanese talking or whatever, you might get a kick out of this.
3119774	3120975	It's a good educational tool.
3121075	3121496	That's true.
3123500	3124061	Lucha Libre, Telemundo
3154081	3159443	Video Games Live, concert featuring performances of music from various classic game titles.
3159583	3166626	It's going to be on Friday, March 24th and performed by the Symphony Silicon Valley Orchestra and its full chorus.
3167967	3169728	Are we going to have the Pong music again?
3171040	3185789	Among the games to be highlighted, we have Mario, Zelda, Halo, Metal Gear Solid, Warcraft, Myst, Castlevania, Medal of Honor, Sonic, Kingdom Hearts, and Final Fantasy, along with a retro classic arcade medley featuring over 20 games.
3187030	3188250	Alright, sounds good.
3188330	3189111	Get your tickets soon.
3189131	3190071	It's going to sell out.
3191332	3192713	Alright, now we're going to move on to another topic.
3192733	3194074	This one's kind of a long topic.
3194434	3199817	And the chat room's actually been asking about this all night long when we're going to get to this, so here we go.
3201505	3210329	You guys probably heard earlier this week there was a gamer out there who took his own life and he was a member of this forum.
3210369	3212010	Which was what?
3212030	3213651	A Metal Gear Solid forum, if I remember right.
3213691	3214611	Unfortunately, here's the thing.
3214972	3226297	The media kind of tied a knot of this story and I'm even looking at this article that Kotaku ran on it that really was trying to sort things out about what the media misreported.
3226317	3229439	I think the media said it was a Bulgarian website at some point or something.
3229459	3229799	It was crazy.
3229819	3229899	Yeah.
3230669	3232030	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
3251340	3253202	Tim Rogers misrepresentation of the AFP story
3270379	3271660	I'm going to read little blips of this here.
3271960	3273522	I'm going to get political with you for a moment.
3273542	3275343	Apparently it was big news for a few moments over in America.
3293457	3295418	Well, the worst thing is it's not true.
3295798	3300680	For one thing, the forum member who did in fact commit suicide did not broadcast his death.
3301080	3304161	Moreover, the forum members tried with all their might to take him down.
3305421	3315825	What can you do is contact the AFPY organization, tell them that you think this is horrible, that they should fire the reporter responsible for these bizarrely malicious lies, and then apologize as widely as possible.
3315845	3320927	If you want to read the whole thing, that was originally published over an insert credit, but it also ran on Kotaku, which is where I first saw it.
3322635	3324836	Good Activism and Bad Activism
3338701	3341423	I'm not going to mince my words on this.
3341503	3343664	I'm going to say exactly how I feel.
3344084	3352170	And before he decides to come after us and say... These are my opinions of you.
3352550	3357333	I am exercising my First Amendment right, you asshole!
3358675	3359936	Jack Thompson is a leech.
3360516	3362457	He is nothing but a parasite.
3362918	3365539	He cares nothing about the person that committed suicide.
3365779	3367100	He cares nothing about the family.
3367120	3370102	He cares nothing about the families of the people involved in those cases he's working on.
3370522	3379147	He is using their pain and suffering to be a leech and use it to further his goal of notoriety and to fill his pocketbook.
3379187	3380248	That is all he is after.
3380308	3381969	He cares nothing about those families.
3382629	3388252	and, of course, is using the gaming community by basically publicly defaming the entire community.
3388452	3390994	And what did he do to demonstrate this to you this week?
3391494	3399158	It had to do with basically the letters and posts he was doing regarding the suicide that went on.
3400659	3409624	Basically, and on top of that, I find this exactly hilarious, he was trying to use the Bible to support, and he's a lawyer?
3409644	3409724	Yeah.
3410242	3412143	He should know something like that would not hold up in court.
3412323	3412823	Excuse me?
3413103	3413343	No, wait.
3413363	3415164	Devil's Advocate for just a minute because I'm curious here.
3415224	3416285	How do we know it's really him?
3416345	3419906	Because these are being done through anonymous posts on the game's politics website.
3420266	3421707	Sorry, game politics website, right?
3422047	3423448	How do we know it's really him?
3424068	3426129	Could it just be somebody trying to... Trace of IP?
3427830	3433452	Also, every other thing that I've ever read by him, it very much fits how he writes.
3434642	3438745	and I've gotten good at that because I've had to hunt down impersonators and things before.
3449873	3458041	I think they actually posted in there some type of letter that Jack Thompson had tried to send to the folks in Pennsylvania against GamePolitics.com.
3474259	3478800	I think it's definitive of how gamers can be very intelligent people.
3478860	3480561	I think this website stands up for that.
3480881	3484162	And when I see Jack Thompson attacking that, it makes me go, he's threatened by that.
3484362	3491304	He's threatened by that good, upstanding gamers doing smart, intelligent things.
3492145	3498146	He called playing video games a masturbatory activity, as in senseless self-stimulation.
3498447	3503088	You know, maybe if he had some stimulation, he wouldn't be so anal retentive that he spews shit every time he opens his mouth.
3504730	3505010	Sorry.
3505570	3507011	I said I wasn't going to mince my words.
3507031	3508292	That's exactly how I feel.
3508752	3509092	All right.
3509272	3509752	Okay.
3509832	3510893	I'm going to be a good girl now.
3511053	3512914	We're going to have to explicit tag this show.
3512934	3513374	That's all right.
3514834	3515795	Usually that gets more listeners.
3515855	3516075	Anyway.
3516855	3517355	Yay, press.
3517455	3517575	No.
3517976	3521377	But seriously, I apologize for my... That was very Jack Thompson of you.
3522578	3522998	Just teasing.
3523758	3528120	But seriously, though, and this... I get the emails on it.
3529011	3533353	I hear about it and it's just, I hit my saturation point.
3533593	3537915	I'm like, okay, someone, he needs to just go away.
3538816	3544839	And, you know, I'm always one that believes if you ignore the problem, you know, it doesn't necessarily go away.
3544939	3545619	It might get worse.
3546299	3549101	You know, things don't change until you make them change, right?
3549721	3555864	Someone seriously, you know, if he's going to be all up in arms defaming the community, I think the community needs to take some steps to defend itself.
3557346	3557787	FlowersForJack.com
3572746	3576007	LiveJournal.com LiveJournal.com LiveJournal.com LiveJournal.com
3602208	3604370	This only makes us into what he says we are.
3604730	3610355	We are to the point that he will disregard any correspondence at the very least, threaten it legally at the most.
3610776	3612337	It's hard to get his attention for real.
3612697	3620344	I propose we write him a stern, dignified letter free of insults, exaggerations or unfounded complaints and state the most honest and reasonable case we can.
3620704	3625909	Most importantly, it will be sent with as many bouquets of beautiful pink roses as I can possibly send to his office.
3626810	3627050	Love it.
3627603	3627903	Love it.
3628404	3629284	You should totally do that.
3629965	3632767	We're going to send $20 on behalf of Orange Lounge Radio.
3632787	3633808	We are contributing to this.
3633828	3635769	He's going to call an act of terrorism.
3636830	3638711	Flowers, an act of terrorism, come on.
3639212	3639692	Come on.
3640613	3646978	And for all those people that I'm reading that say, you know, kill him, do that, no.
3646998	3649159	That's exactly what these guys are saying you should not do.
3649339	3654263	But my other point to that, to maybe convince people that that's not the best course of action?
3654824	3655164	Martyr.
3656150	3658452	Remember what happened to our last major martyr, right?
3658492	3660834	We now have rampant Christianity everywhere.
3661474	3672223	Now listen, this is the same guy who considered a donation in his name of $10,000 as a defamation of character.
3672423	3674425	I mean, it's pretty retarded.
3676026	3683572	I did also find it funny that one of the things I read, how he's bringing out that had this person known the love of Jesus Christ, they wouldn't have done that.
3684033	3685694	He was basically shot down by a minister.
3686844	3689707	by a Protestant pastor.
3690687	3693029	This kind of brings me to another point.
3693490	3706200	I get really nervous when we get into the religious talk on this show, and I'm not a very religious person myself, and there are certain types of religious people I have a lot of respect for.
3706220	3714407	I have a really, really good friend of mine at work who's a deeply religious person, but I value him totally as a friend, and I really respect him and his beliefs and stuff because
3714707	3715408	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3733173	3734474	I don't know how much of this I really want to read.
3734494	3737055	You should just go read it for yourself over on GamePolitics.com.
3737815	3745359	I am a Christian, non-denominational, yet I am also the first person to admit that enforcing religious opinion as a way of censorship in video games is asinine.
3745679	3746480	Let's face facts.
3746540	3748961	Video games are fiction, just like books, movies, and television.
3749241	3755984	However, it seems as if pundits, lawyers, and media mongers have been using my religion as a meat shield for their ignorant attacks on video games.
3756804	3759786	Very interesting, and it kind of goes on to these...
3760475	3760975	GamePolitics.com
3790287	3791247	That is a good point.
3791668	3792668	That is a very good point.
3793128	3795809	And, you know, we do also donate to charity once in a while, too.
3795869	3802051	We did the big audio Sacramento Independent Audio for Katrina Relief thing a while ago, which was a good success.
3802512	3803832	And, you know, so we do that stuff, too.
3803892	3807273	But we, you know, we support causes that we want to back.
3807393	3813856	And this is definitely one of those causes that we think ought to deserve a little support and a little air time and a little money.
3814096	3814636	Just a little money.
3814656	3815336	We're not sending them a lot.
3815396	3816177	Twenty bucks isn't a lot.
3816757	3817317	So, anyway.
3818998	3819318	Whew.
3820874	3821794	Anything else you want to say on that?
3822695	3823055	We good?
3823575	3824635	Loki, you're awfully quiet.
3825916	3836760	Jack, he had that thing that came out last week about wanting to recall all these games that are coming out in 25 to Life and all these violent murder simulators, as he said.
3838500	3838920	He's right.
3839200	3841181	We do have too many murder simulators out there.
3841201	3843002	That's why we need more sex simulators.
3843162	3844282	That's what I'm hoping for.
3845503	3848103	Rockstar, if you're listening, get on it.
3848724	3849584	Hot coffee the game.
3850442	3850783	All right.
3851123	3853446	We got one more segment to do before we go to break here.
3853646	3858272	And it just seemed like, I don't know why, but it seemed like an inappropriate time to get into this segment.
3858593	3859394	Maybe it's just me.
3859954	3864000	But it's time to bring on the anger in the FUs of the week.
3873820	3875881	DarkSakura, what's ticking you off this week?
3876681	3881924	Well, I think I actually just ranted myself out on the biggest thing that was pissing me off this week.
3883424	3896590	So, instead of going off on ye olde butthead again, I'm going to have to say that my biggest FU of the week goes toward waiting to the last minute to get things done.
3897410	3902152	In this case, I blame myself because I waited to the last minute to check my tires, so now I have a flat.
3902973	3903293	Oops!
3904668	3932354	but it's I see so many I have to deal with this so often in my daily work people going oh I didn't do it or oh I forgot or oh this it goes back to this thing called personal responsibility right it's personal responsibility I think people not accounting for it not having it is what is contributing to the downfall of this country you see it in little things every day you see it on a wide scale like with our
3933613	3939857	Not-so-good-friend Mr. Thompson, who is blaming games instead of individual people for their own actions, right?
3940617	3943539	We see it ourselves with, oh, well, I can just do this later.
3944199	3946901	Or with, oh, but I was busy doing this.
3947381	3949843	If people said, you know, I admit I was wrong.
3950243	3951244	Let me make amends.
3951824	3952564	Let me do this.
3953005	3956186	If people would just stop and admit, hey, you know, you need to do this.
3957007	3958488	Or, I didn't do it.
3958808	3959849	Or, here, it's done.
3960129	3960609	Right on time.
3961490	3962090	I think that
3962927	3963647	Would I be better off?
3965088	3966528	It's a sign of responsibility.
3967648	3971649	You know, the moment you admit that you broke the glass is the day you're supposed to be an adult, right?
3972429	3973490	Instead of blaming the dog.
3974650	3974970	Hmm.
3976010	3976350	Alright.
3976811	3977111	Loki?
3978491	3978951	My F.U.
3978971	3981032	of the week is going to McDonald's.
3981412	3983632	Mainly, though, it's not McDonald's fault.
3983932	3988614	I'm blaming vegetarians and fat people for making McDonald's food taste like crap.
3988994	3989854	Here's the reason why.
3990356	3996183	Before the vegetarians attacked McDonald's for adding their meat flavoring to their fries, their fries kicked ass.
3996503	4001609	Then they came in, fries taste like crap now, and they can't freaking cook them, poor damn.
4002222	4006103	The other thing is, also, they've tried to make these more healthy choices on their menus.
4006583	4006863	No!
4007403	4007724	Need?
4007924	4010944	The food was good before you had to go and fuck with it.
4011004	4013845	Listen, if you don't want to eat that crap, don't attack my food.
4014065	4015806	God damn it, I love super size.
4016146	4018847	I love the amount of soda that I got there and the amount of fries.
4019087	4020027	I was happy with that.
4020067	4023048	But no, you had to come in and put large size on there instead.
4023788	4024468	Fuck you!
4024948	4025928	I want my food!
4028129	4028529	Alright.
4029069	4031550	My FU of the week goes to Ticket
4032799	4060909	and things like Ticketmaster and Tickets.com because I still haven't gotten my tickets for a concert that's coming up next week and I hate these exorbitant charges just for printing a freaking ticket it's so crazy I don't like the way tickets are done I never get good seats why is it that I can log on there at like 10.01 and all the good seats are gone oh because all the good seats go to contest winners and industry people and people that don't deserve to be in the front row I deserve to be in the front row
4062144	4064746	I don't like the way ticketing is done, so F you to that
4090720	4092801	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4121241	4121722	Adorable.
4122122	4126525	But basically the whole premise of this site is people actually just putting things on the cat.
4127166	4127746	Sending a picture.
4128227	4132330	Now please don't hurt your cat if you're going to do this, because that's animal cruelty and that's not cool.
4132550	4136073	Some of these cats just look anywhere from amused to vaguely annoyed.
4136433	4137614	Some of them are game related though, right?
4137795	4140797	Oh yeah, well this one has wrestling figures sitting on the cat.
4141718	4145080	And there was another one, this one has an Xbox 360 laying on a cat.
4145661	4146822	The cat just looks irritated.
4147574	4148134	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4177512	4181294	One of my co-workers and Jamie both pointed this site out to me on the same day.
4181334	4183976	I thought that was really weird, like how word travels like that.
4184636	4185297	It was new to me.
4185557	4188258	I randomly check stuffonmycat.com quite often.
4188298	4189019	It's cute!
4189599	4191760	You know, there's one with naked Barbies on it.
4192181	4194742	Another one just with a giant bag on it.
4195522	4196423	I think it's adorable.
4196483	4197844	I love stuffonmycat.com.
4200165	4200846	No, that's wrong.
4200866	4203287	I was going to say my favorite is the one where I saw, you know,
4204884	4208205	Someone's SUV's rear tire on top of a cat, but you know.
4208406	4209066	Hey!
4210106	4210426	Alright.
4210747	4214008	I think, though, that there should be mycatonstuff.com.
4215609	4216869	I looked for it, but no one did it yet.
4217810	4223712	I found the picture with the cat covered in Game Boys, so I'm moving that to the chat room.
4223732	4224773	That's the one my co-workers showed me.
4224793	4225853	You know what this all is?
4225933	4227954	This is just the US version of Oolong.
4228897	4229617	in a way.
4229637	4231118	You know Oolong's on Wikipedia now.
4231498	4232658	Yes, I link that to you too.
4233158	4235439	And so is you being, but Oolong's dead.
4235599	4237240	And we're on Wikipedia, Orange Lounge Radio.
4237620	4241981	That's like, that's when some of my friends told me, dude, Rob, you guys really are famous.
4242021	4242901	You're on Wikipedia.
4242921	4243542	I'm like, come on.
4243882	4246042	We do this show out of the spare bedroom in my apartment.
4246302	4249063	We're not famous yet, but we are on Wikipedia, which is all kinds of cool.
4250003	4251864	We're internet celebrities, yo.
4253004	4254125	Take that however you want.
4254625	4255585	All right, we're going to go to a break.
4255605	4258066	When we come back from the break, Loki's going to bring us a whole
4258752	4269323	buttload of Xbox 360 stuff and we're going to do the worst reviewed games of all time and lots of stuff coming up after the break.
