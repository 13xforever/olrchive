6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,540
and quite a busy first half there little bit a little bit of controversy was it

7
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,440
was there a single controversial subject we didn't touch there on the first half

8
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:43,600
I'm not sure we talked about politics sexuality a fast food talk about a midget

9
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,980
rights oh well maybe in this half we'll see for those I need to be more midget

10
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,180
gamers for those that were listening or that are listening to this on the

11
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,380
podcast feed who haven't heard the first half of the show yet definitely go back

12
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,920
and download the first half it's a it's a good show so check it out anyway we're

13
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,420
gonna get back in because we have a lot of stuff to talk about in this half of

14
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,260
the show and we're gonna start it off we'll start off with Loki who's got a

15
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:11,360
story about Microsoft what's going on with Microsoft are they are they doing

16
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,000
the handhelds or not this is a rumor it's been going on for a long time

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,280
maybe that's I think the official response from it's something that

18
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,160
they're looking towards because they want to compete with the iPod and

19
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:27,680
looking at maybe starting up a portable gaming development team or something like that or

20
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,440
portable something development team.

21
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,240
So it's a maybe.

22
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,800
That's pretty much I think what the official word's been.

23
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:42,000
Something of course they're going to look at if they can figure out a way to do it profibly.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,800
So it'll be one of those things like okay well we'll see what happens but I'm not going

25
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,960
to say yay or nay on it.

26
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,020
There's definitely not any firm plans on it, so it's just going to be, you know, we'll

27
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,020
have to wait for that.

28
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,660
All right.

29
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:05,820
Moving on, I have some feedback from the chat room on the controversial subjects.

30
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,640
Somebody mentioned that we didn't mention Jack Thompson yet during the program.

31
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,580
Tony mentioned that in the chat room there, so.

32
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,580
Thank God.

33
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,060
Well, I should give you guys an update on the Flowers for Jack campaign.

34
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,620
Remember we talked about that last week and how we contributed $20 to that effort?

35
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,620
Guess what?

36
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,780
something like they raised a crazy amount of money I don't think they

37
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,060
posted the final figure yet but when I last checked they had something like

38
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,700
over $900 and it got to the point where it was they're gonna spend 650 on the

39
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:35,420
flowers and the rest they're donating to and I forgive me I don't have time to

40
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,920
dig for this right now I think it think it's called child's play which is the

41
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,580
foundation that the penny arcade folks set up when they were getting you know

42
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,740
hit with the Jack Thompson stuff too so that's that's great it's been a

43
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:50,680
fundraiser in many ways so that's a good thing awesome so congratulations to the

44
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:56,460
flowers for Jack folks so now I now we've now we've mentioned that all right

45
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,920
anyway let's get back well you know talking about Jack sometimes um conjures

46
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,340
these feelings inside of us that we just can't control these feelings of angst

47
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,720
such such angst and that brings us to one of our favorite segments on the show

48
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,560
the FUs of the week right dark Sakura oh yeah

49
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,840
it's really my f you and you know I actually mentioned it already in the

50
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,320
show but if you do that woman at Barnes & Noble you know just a big stinking pile

51
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:42,760
poo on her because if you're going to say excuse me even if the people haven't

52
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,960
heard you you still wait to acknowledge that they heard you before shoving

53
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,000
somebody out of the way. I'm sorry what has happened to the state of manners

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,920
here? How's that she had her grandchildren with her? She's teaching them that it is okay to push people out of the way.

55
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:04,360
See Jack Thompson needs to focus on behavior like that. On just general rudeness and

56
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:10,360
And the fact that people go around insulting and will not admit when they were the one who were at fault.

57
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,360
I'm there.

58
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:22,360
Loki, my FU of the week is going towards, you know, this is basically I have nothing right now, planet Earth for being a cocky bitch.

59
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,360
What?

60
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:31,080
What? Seriously, this plane is a cocky bitch and thinks it's like all, you know, holier

61
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,240
than thou just because, you know, it's got life on it or something. I don't know. I got

62
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,600
nothing, really, I don't. My week was okay. I have nothing that really pisses me. Oh wait,

63
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,460
I do. I'm sorry, I take that back. Fuck uses goddamn people to keep parking in the fire

64
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,320
lane thinking it's their own personal parking space even though there's a red curb there.

65
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,640
goddamn day there's a car parked there and nobody tickets these cars. Well, fuck them,

66
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:59,560
you see? Because if I want to back out of my car, you know, back out of my space, which

67
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,900
happens to be in the corner of this entire parking lot, you know, I have to avoid these

68
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:09,000
people that are parked in these illegal spaces. And the audacity of these people, they actually,

69
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,440
you know, look at me like, what? You're in my way, you know? It's like, fuck them. I

70
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,880
eat my apartment complex. See I knew you had it in you, being a liar. But I also hate her,

71
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,160
because she is a cockadoo. Alright, uh, my F.U. of the week, my F.U. of the week goes

72
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,860
to the Italian restaurant in Sacramento, and I'm not even gonna name it, because nobody

73
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,160
outside the area would know it anyway. They gave me food poisoning yesterday. My pasta,

74
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,240
like I had this dish that was lasagna and pasta, it was like a little bit of both, the

75
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,800
pasta was cold, and I should have known that something was wrong then, because that probably

76
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,840
means my meat lasagna was undercooked, and I got very very sick last night, and that's

77
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,300
no fun at all. Food poisoning sucks. So, yeah, thank you. I know this isn't television, but

78
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,840
Jamie's doing the cry face from Battle Royale.

79
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,840
Try not to have your head exploded, okay?

80
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,840
So, well, something exploded last night, but it wasn't my head, I'll tell you that. Ew.

81
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,840
Alright, moving on.

82
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,840
You're listening to KTMI.

83
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,500
Uh, let's change the subject promptly. Let's talk about a much happier thing. Let's talk

84
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:19,640
about Konami Gamers Day! Yay! Are you bitter about that, Dark Sakura? I'm bitter because

85
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:25,320
I had to spend the day at my job. I'm sorry. Well, Loki and I got a rare opportunity to

86
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,400
go to Konami Gamers Day this week and check out all the Konami products that are coming

87
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,720
out this year, at least in the first two months of the year. It was awesome. Dark Sakura,

88
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,760
I don't want you to feel left out, so we have gifts for Dark Sakura that we brought back

89
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,620
from Gamers Day. No, stop crying, you're going to love these gifts.

90
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,680
This is a poster, it's a Metal Gear Saga poster.

91
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,800
Very rare, it's a promotional poster.

92
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,820
And check this out, here's what I do with press kits.

93
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,300
I'm going to give Jamie the press kit for a Metal Gear Saga as well so she can

94
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,140
check that out

95
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:02,220
with her husband Dan who's a big Metal Gear fan as well.

96
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,500
You know what he was playing today was Gran Turismo 2.

97
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,080
That has nothing to do with Metal Gear or Konami.

98
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,080
No.

99
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,080
Okay.

100
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,080
Anyway, so don't feel left out.

101
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,080
There you go.

102
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,160
But I'm giving you guys that press kit for a reason, so you can report on that for the

103
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,040
site too, and the stuff blog.

104
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,600
It even smells pressy.

105
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,600
Alright.

106
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,820
So, meanwhile, while Jamie's ogling that, Loki and I want to talk about Konami Gamers

107
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,840
Day a little bit, but, Jamie, feel free to interject your thoughts, because you probably

108
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,280
have an opinion on these games as well.

109
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,960
Loki, what'd you think of Konami Gamers Day?

110
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,280
It was a fun, it was a good time.

111
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,280
It was fun.

112
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,280
I loved it.

113
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,280
Yeah.

114
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,320
inviting us and you know letting the podcast world get exposure to that as

115
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,640
well is a good time

116
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,680
yeah so let's talk about let's talk about some of the games we saw okay all

117
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,200
right did you check out Tao's adventure a little bit it's a role-playing game

118
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,240
coming out for the DS is going to be out soon

119
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,980
I played a little bit the the build that they were showing there though was like

120
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:55,120
the full game so it started me off from the beginning so it was kind of slow to

121
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,120
get into so I seriously spent like 30 minutes of this game and barely got

122
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,860
anywhere I mean I kind of learned that you cast spells by drawing little

123
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,380
symbols on the bottom part you have to memorize like to cast a lightning spell

124
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,580
you draw a little lightning bolt it seemed okay but it seemed like kind of

125
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,300
like just your average run-of-the-mill RPG it there was nothing about it that

126
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,980
really excited me I don't know if you feel the same way Loki it was yeah it was

127
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:22,100
okay I think I think folks who are into RPGs and it seems like one of those

128
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,420
monster collection type of games you might get a kick out of that Street

129
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,860
Supremacy Loki would you think Street Supremacy a racing game that's coming

130
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,660
out for the PSP by Konami well it's actually pretty cool and what it is is

131
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:39,660
It's sort of a port of Tokyo Xtreme Racer, so if you've played that series you've pretty much kind of have an idea what this game is going to be like.

132
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:50,660
Looks pretty cool, and it reminded me, the comparison I had with it, it reminded me of Wangdens Midnight Tune, the arcade game, it reminded me of that.

133
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:57,660
But it's a pretty good game, there's not that many racing games out there for the PSP, so, you know, more the merrier.

134
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:02,880
And I know the price point on it's pretty cheap when it's coming out, so I I ran out of time to check out

135
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,520
Street supremacy, but it looked okay. I mean I'm not a big huge on racing

136
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,700
I like burnout, but we'll see maybe I'll check it out one thing

137
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:16,040
I liked a lot on the PSP was a Gradius collection sweet. I like that played through a little bit of Gradius one and

138
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,800
It's cool because they changed it a little bit so that it's widescreen, and it doesn't really do it by stretching the image

139
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,260
So much I I think it happens a little bit

140
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,060
But they kind of went back and redid it and you can tell they changed some things about the game, too

141
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:33,980
For instance the first boss that you fight happens immediately after the volcano

142
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:39,500
Sequence in the first stage for those of you guys that have played Gradius before so the volcanoes are in the way while you're trying

143
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,840
To fight the boss, so that's a little bit of extra challenge to it

144
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,220
Which I thought was kind of cool means you can't sit in the hidey spot, right exactly exactly

145
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:50,340
So they they they changed that a little bit and they made it more seamless like it's a very seamless kind of game

146
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,540
That's the only one I checked out but Gradius collection is gonna have several Gradius games in it

147
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,640
you know that's gonna mean is it's gonna be nine versions of of uh... gradius we

148
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,800
own no proteus though

149
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,840
and that makes me upset we need more proteus maybe later

150
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:08,740
rumba roses x x lucky to check this out seems all tina yeah all tina i i'm

151
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,480
rumba roses is okay but the problem i have with this game in wrestling games

152
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,520
in general is that it's kind of slow the actions very slow in these kinds of

153
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,880
games very slow seen that's the things they're touting that the game had you

154
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,920
know, probably the best visuals on the 360, but the movements are all really jerky, and

155
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,920
that's the thing.

156
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,880
But other than that, it plays very similar to the first game.

157
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,800
The only differences I could say is, my description of this would be like, it's kind of a cross

158
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,240
between DOA 4 and DOA Beach Volleyball, is the best way to describe it.

159
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,840
Because they have this photo mode, you can make your characters busty and almost naked,

160
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:49,000
and then just all different sort of things on them to kind of customize them to play

161
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
online.

162
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,840
I was taking notes during the keynote speeches and I remember Akari Uchida, who's the producer

163
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,480
of Rumble Roses XX, said that they were making fun of DOA a little bit.

164
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,480
Remember that?

165
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,000
He said, yeah, we're making fun of DOA in this part.

166
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,400
Because they have sequences in the gate, they have a photo shoot sequence, like you can

167
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:11,040
take pictures, sexy pictures of the folks and low-key something like that.

168
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,040
It's all T&A.

169
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,440
Yeah, it's all T&A.

170
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,360
It's fun and I think it's a party game to me.

171
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,160
I'll be picking it up, for sure.

172
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,480
Let's watch the Super Bowl and play some Rumba Roses.

173
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,480
There's one fighting game for the 360.

174
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,280
I mean, come on.

175
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,400
It's going to sell.

176
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,320
And it's a pretty fun game.

177
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,280
And definitely just for the T&A factor, I mean, it works.

178
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,400
And you'll be able to play it online, which I thought

179
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:35,900
was cool.

180
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,680
And you can customize your character,

181
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,560
including the size of the boobs.

182
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,860
You can customize.

183
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,880
The producer was kind of saying, oh, everybody,

184
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,400
it won't just be anesthesia versus anesthesia,

185
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,480
and they look the same.

186
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,000
you could customize the colors in the and the size and shape of it but i'm

187
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,160
like okay on live

188
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,560
they're all going to have huge test their create a wrestler

189
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,140
not so it i think that was kind of their response to create a wrestler they had

190
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:04,000
a being able to create one yes and no they do i think have a career wrestler

191
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,240
and then you can also modify the ones that they have on their i got the sense

192
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,200
the creator wrestlers more you modify the existing one significantly

193
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,420
not like soul caliber create a character

194
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,260
will differ

195
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:20,220
But the other things that they were going to have, they were a little bit different

196
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:26,380
with it. I know other than the create a character type stuff, which was pretty cool. Then they

197
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:30,220
have the tag team matches. They're also going to have downloadable content later, like more

198
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,860
costumes and whatnot. Plus there was some weird stuff. If you caught it in the videos,

199
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,860
they have a robot character and then there's two bears that are in the game, much like

200
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,980
Tekken. So they've got that in there as well.

201
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,520
Who is fighting? Oh my gosh, Bear is fighting. How can this be?

202
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,980
Metal Gear Substinence!

203
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,980
Subs-Substinence? I can never say this. Subs-Subs-Subs-

204
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,780
Okay. Subs-uh-stuh-nance.

205
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:58,080
Substinence. I-I- Metal Gear is one of those-

206
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,540
I'm gonna- I can't- I don't have time to play everything, guys. I do have a day job as

207
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,780
well as this program.

208
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,440
Metal Gear is one of those series I don't follow. I leave it to Jamie to follow the

209
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,860
series and correct me on it.

210
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,380
So, but, Loki, did you check this out? Metal Gear Subs- I looked at it briefly.

211
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,860
What did you think? It was good. I like how they've added the multiplayer in there.

212
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,940
That's definitely going to be the highlight of the game.

213
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,780
I like all the add-ons they're gonna have for this. Like you get the Metal Gear

214
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:22,180
Saga DVD. They were showing clips from that. That looks very cool. Well,

215
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:26,060
only if you pre-order at a major retailer like GameStop or EV or whatever, but most

216
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:26,980
people are, so...

217
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,220
You'll probably be able to get it either way. And the original Metal Gear

218
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,660
on NES and Metal Gear 2. That's true. The MSX.

219
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,580
Exactly. Not the one that Kojima pretty much wrote off. What was Snake's

220
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,140
Revenge? Snake's Revenge, yeah. Not that one.

221
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,460
The real Metal Gear 2.

222
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,460
I thought that was interesting.

223
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:45,860
The MSX one was actually pretty fun and it had the things that they referred to back

224
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:51,780
in the first Metal Gear Solid about Big Boss and Gray Fox, a lot of that was involved in

225
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,780
Metal Gear 2.

226
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,780
Very true.

227
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:58,340
And actually they have, they go into that in the Saga DVD as they were talking about

228
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,340
all that stuff.

229
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,340
I thought it was very interesting.

230
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,900
Did you, were you watching a little preview and it had Kojima talking about how Metal

231
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,180
Gear Solid 3 had a very maternal theme in it and all that stuff?

232
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,180
Yeah.

233
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,620
interesting some of the stuff he said so check that out on the DVD sweet code and

234
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:16,100
five is another one I kind of ran out of time to look at and it's a good thing

235
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,340
meatlet off stepped out for a little bit or he probably punched me right now

236
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,460
because he loves sweet coding did you check it out at all I like I'm not a

237
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:25,140
huge we couldn't fan I looked at it it looked pretty but you know it's it's

238
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,380
not a sui coding game it's gonna be the same type of thing yeah if you're into

239
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:33,940
sui coding from what I hear five is better than four but maybe not quite as

240
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,540
good as one and two but it's it's it's worthwhile having for for those you guys

241
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,900
during this week. One game I definitely checked out was Beatmania.

242
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,500
What did you think of Beatmania? Beatmania is cool. I like the licensed songs in there.

243
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,500
That was done very well. Funky Town?

244
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:52,340
Won't you take me to Funky Town? Yeah, and they're all remixes too. They're all like garage remixes.

245
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,340
They had Toxic on there.

246
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:58,620
But yeah, I played them. They're cool.

247
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,500
And I like the new controller. New controller is awesome. New controller will

248
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,260
still flip.

249
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,460
So if you're right side pried, left side pried, whatever, it still flips. But the side

250
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,060
with the turntable is rounded.

251
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,260
so it's a little different but I'm hearing I'm hearing it's more spring

252
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:14,120
action in the keys so the keys won't stick like the Japanese controllers did

253
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,120
so that's great it played

254
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,820
it played fine for me I had a good time with the game. My controller doesn't stick.

255
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:22,380
Well consider yourself lucky. You still should pick up one of these US controllers.

256
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,880
I have a mutant controller

257
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,580
okay and I am gonna pick up a US controller. And if you do happen to have a controller the game

258
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,420
will be offered with the controller without the controller so

259
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,740
Oh I didn't pick that part up. That means they know we're out there.

260
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,300
That's why I have the advantage for working at a distributor.

261
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,620
For those you guys concerned about the authenticity compared to the Japanese

262
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,840
originals, I'm told that

263
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,340
another's do show up in the game, they're just locked away at the start,

264
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,420
but you can unlock the another's for those you guys that really want the

265
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,140
difficult stuff.

266
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:54,540
I am hearing they change some note charts, but I'm hearing from

267
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:58,820
folks who play a lot of Beatmania that it's not as bad as you think.

268
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:02,660
They change note charts mostly to add in some of the free scratch zones

269
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,500
and things cuz they are bringing over the free scratch zones which showed up I

270
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,020
think in some

271
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,460
early early BeatMania games and then BeatMania 3. They had that, I noticed it was in

272
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:13,740
Metal Gear Solid the remix cuz I remember I have BeatMania 2nd mix and I don't

273
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,500
remember the free scratching being there

274
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,420
but they added that in there or something. It was in 4th mix, it was in

275
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,820
CM2, it was also I think it was removed from

276
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:28,020
I think if memory serves me correctly I do think that it was in 2DX

277
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,340
up until I want to say the substream

278
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,880
release the one that linked to DDR second mix right

279
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,920
and then after that no more questions from chat room here spirits nair wants to

280
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,200
know how did the controller feel I wanna know

281
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,360
it felt like the regular controllers to me but just

282
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,460
the key taps were a little different but nothing

283
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:53,440
nothing that's gonna throw you I mean it it feels it feels nice I think the US

284
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,660
players gonna be very pleased at the improvements over the Japanese

285
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,640
controllers I really do

286
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:01,200
So, I'm very excited about that.

287
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,980
Moving on, what did you think of the Silent Hill experience?

288
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,540
I thought this was interesting.

289
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,240
It's different.

290
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:14,620
It's not a game, but it's like a comic book slash audio and visual tour of the Silent

291
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:22,480
Hill series on the PSP that includes the first four games and the movie.

292
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,480
It reminded me of the...

293
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,920
Does it address the Game Boy one?

294
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,920
No, I don't think...

295
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:30,640
I don't know. They didn't say specifically. It reminded me of them almost like selling

296
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,780
a special features disc for the movie by itself. That's what it feels like.

297
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:40,580
They actually did that for Metal Gear Solid 2.

298
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,160
And they were actually doing something very similar for Metal Gear. Now to bring that

299
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,720
up, the Metal Gear comics, they're also going to be doing on the PSP. You can have these

300
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,360
comics on the PSP. It looked very well detailed and well drawn. It looked pretty cool and

301
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,720
a little bit interactive as well. So I know one thing they were really pushing

302
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,820
during the keynotes was innovation. Konami wants to innovate this year and these two

303
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,000
products definitely show that they want to be innovative.

304
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,440
For me, the deciding factor on the Silent Hill experience is price point.

305
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,720
Because if Silent Hill experience costs as much as a normal PSP game, I don't

306
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,140
think that's fair because it's not a game.

307
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:15,840
But if it's a $20 thing, I think it'll be great. And they're not the only ones doing comics either.

308
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,400
Hmm. Capcom is getting in on that kind of action as well.

309
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:25,900
Oh interesting. Yeah, interesting. All right. What did you think of Metal Gear acid 2? Metal Gear acid 2 is pretty good

310
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,300
I'd never I didn't really care for the first one. It looks pretty fun

311
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:34,540
I'm just not in I really kind of wanted a Metal Gear solid game. Not really a card battle game

312
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,540
I really hate card battle games

313
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,140
every single one of them

314
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,540
the

315
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,980
solid I

316
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,020
wasn't as solid as I thought it would it's gonna be and

317
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,780
And, okay, we have to explain the solid eye.

318
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,020
It's actually a cardboard cutout,

319
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:53,020
goggle thing that you can put over your PSP

320
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,840
and the game will play in some 3D fashion.

321
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,100
I had Virtual Boy flashbacks playing this thing.

322
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,080
It didn't work for me.

323
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,820
I didn't care for the 3D thing very much.

324
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,120
I thought it was kind of a cheesy feature,

325
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,620
but you can take it off and the game looks fine.

326
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,180
Like, it's interesting,

327
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,020
because the way it works

328
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,620
is that it doesn't ruin the visuals of the game.

329
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,700
So, I don't know how much I'd actually use this,

330
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,940
the 3D goggle thing.

331
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,340
It's a throwaway feature to me.

332
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,200
It was kind of cool, but the other thing that I thought was funny, because this was in the

333
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,580
Japanese version, they were talking about the sexy girls, they do have a lot of sexy

334
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,580
girls.

335
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:28,320
In fact, I remember seeing a dump of this game online or whatever, and half of the disc

336
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,180
was all movies of sexy girls and camo and stuff, so.

337
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,220
Karaoke Revolution Country.

338
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,220
Yeah.

339
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,380
I heard about this.

340
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:44,260
This to me, I was like a vampire and it was garlic, and I was staying far away from the

341
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:48,680
it it was the first game I played actually it was an okay looking game

342
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:53,080
I just I don't like country music and we I don't have a very good

343
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,040
experience with that curio revolution it's very similar to kr party

344
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,320
I'm it runs on almost the exact same interface but I thought was interesting

345
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,320
is they've added some interesting I toy features

346
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,520
you know how in kr party you could create a character you can also create a

347
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,520
character in the country one but you can take your own picture on the I toy and

348
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,480
have your face

349
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,600
on the character which I thought was very interesting and

350
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,120
You can also do the itoy thing. Some backgrounds have big TV monitors and it'll put you singing in your living room

351
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,440
uh in the TV monitors and that's it that's

352
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:28,560
It's cheesy, but it's cute. Like I think it'll be fun for for the party atmosphere of karaoke revolution. I think it's cute and

353
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,960
Whereas I probably won't buy this game because i'm not much of a country fan

354
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:37,200
I think it's good that they're opening up opening this franchise up to a good to a new audience

355
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,840
I think and the partnership with cmt as well smart move. Yeah, definitely and

356
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,880
And you know, for my limited knowledge of country songs,

357
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,480
it's a pretty good mix.

358
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,400
Yu-Gi-Oh!

359
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,740
USB.

360
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,120
It's a little Yu-Gi-Oh!

361
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,600
game you can put on the, or it's Yu-Gi-Oh!

362
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,640
that's already on the USB, and you can basically

363
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,140
take it anywhere with you, plug it into the computer, and go.

364
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,720
It's an innovation thing, but I mean, Yu-Gi-Oh!, great.

365
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,120
I thought it was quite interesting

366
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,520
how they wanted to explain how it worked,

367
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,200
and I'm like, I think we get it.

368
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,640
You know?

369
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,680
All right.

370
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,840
How about DDR Supernova? No, I didn't play that at all. Let's see.

371
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:20,520
I was the first person in the United States outside of Konami to play the game, so...

372
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:24,360
You're staking that claim right there? Staking that claim, I believe I was number

373
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,760
four to play under that machine, besides Jason Enos and two other Konami employees that were

374
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:35,760
testing it out. I was on that game almost all day. It was great. I love it. I'm really

375
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:41,980
Really out of shape though and my only complaint is max or fascination max

376
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:47,400
I think it's a dumb sounding song and the step bonus stage. Yeah, the bonus stage the boss song or whatever

377
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,540
It sounds like a really crappy fan mix and the steps it reminds me of a really bad sim file

378
00:21:52,660 --> 00:22:00,060
That's it's really sad that that's you know, because they could do so much better and I remember like, you know paranoia

379
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,940
Respect that was a cool remix of paranoia and it sounded cool and was hard

380
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:08,860
but it's starting to get to the point now with max you have max period which

381
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:13,220
was just bullshit as it was as a song and a remix and now this is just a step

382
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:18,020
beyond that and it I don't know might some people like it because it's super

383
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:22,520
hard I personally didn't care for it but you know what there's 300 and some songs

384
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:27,660
in this thing who cares one song one song in it I don't care I had a real

385
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:33,060
good time playing it to um a lot of repeats for me but I'm I understand that

386
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:37,900
DDR this is an early build and I think a lot of folks on like DDR freaking stuff

387
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:42,720
or take running with this like I think there's still much more news to come on

388
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,840
DDR supernova I'm just happy it's coming back to the arcades you have to

389
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,960
understand that the build that we played on was 50% done add 230 songs on it

390
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,580
right now most of which were repeats but who cares there it's just the old stuff

391
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:00,060
there's that means 70 new songs that are gonna be in there so I'm very curious to

392
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,940
check out battle mode because that's something I've been bitching about needs

393
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:07,860
to be in an arcade DDR that's not Disney Mix for a long long time and I'm really

394
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,860
excited to see the battle mode I want to see what this is all about because I

395
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:14,700
think DDR could be marketed as a very competitive game and it looks like it's

396
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,740
kind of going that way because they're they're doing the tournaments and you

397
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:22,980
know like tournament mode it's going to be released in all three regions US UK

398
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:27,940
and Japan what's going to be great also the interface is really strange there's

399
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:31,580
no more backgrounds to songs I've noticed like you know no more background

400
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:36,320
pictures. I completely missed that. It's all just normal video unless it actually has a

401
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,440
video then it's got you know other than that it's got like the 3D stage with the dancers

402
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,520
and stuff. But that could be something that's still being worked on too we don't know. Yeah

403
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,040
it's hard to say. Mods and stuff they were pretty much all the same mods they had the

404
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:52,680
only thing that I noticed that was different kind of taking it from almost like step mania

405
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,200
jumps you can remove the jumps from the songs so if you don't want to have a lot of that

406
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:02,080
stuff and then they renamed kind of what the different note patterns were called

407
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,300
and stuff I have to correct myself huh I just did this thing again and it's

408
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:14,720
substance Oh subsistence subsistence yes subsistence anyway so DER supernova

409
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,420
thumbs up for me I definitely approve and I think the best is still yet to

410
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:20,740
come on DER supernova I think I I understand they're taking it around the

411
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:24,600
country right now in location test isn't so Cal right now and it's probably the

412
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:29,320
same machine we played at Gamers' Day. I'm pretty sure it is. It probably took it down to SoCal.

413
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,480
Don't consider it a finished game just yet.

414
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,520
It's only 50% done.

415
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:38,280
Did you hear though that Naoki and Taka actually went down from Gamers' Day

416
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,960
to the location test? Yeah, I saw that. Yeah, very interesting. Yeah, that was kind of

417
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,480
funny, the whole story with Naoki. He was there taking pictures of the

418
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,600
machine and people playing and stuff.

419
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,160
He was kind of running around like a little girl. It was kind of funny.

420
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:57,600
just, you know, watching them, you know, so excited about everything. It was great. But,

421
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:04,600
you know, and we got some cool GIFs and stuff and, I don't know, new songs, interesting

422
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:11,760
to say the least. Not too impressed with some of them. I could care for a little bit less

423
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:18,760
Toxic being in Superhero, oh, that reminds me, Toxic in Beatmania. I like what they did

424
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:25,760
I like what they did with the videos in the background because it kind of reminded me of new videos for the songs which are pretty cool.

425
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:33,760
Did you notice though in some of the videos they didn't bother changing them? Like at Colors it still says 2DX 6 style in the corner in the video. They didn't bother taking them out.

426
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:41,760
Well I don't know because they looked like a finished build to me and I noticed this when Taka was playing against the Konami employee, Ferrari, when they were battling each other.

427
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,760
each other. Ferrari won, by the way, and Taka failed the song. They were playing colors,

428
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,800
and they had a little six-style logo in the corner. I noticed that, and it looked like

429
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,800
a final build of the game to me. I mean, this thing's coming out pretty soon, so I think

430
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,080
they just didn't bother changing it, but, you know, who cares?

431
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,480
It hasn't gotten gold yet, though, so I think it's fine.

432
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,040
We'll see, we'll see. Anything else you want to say about Konami Gamers' Day?

433
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:05,340
I just, you know, I'm really glad to have gone. I wish they had shown more stuff that's

434
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:10,420
coming out, because most of the stuff that they covered is just up till March.

435
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:13,500
So that leaves the whole rest of the year.

436
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:19,220
I was hoping Ultramix 4 or something like that, Silent Hill 5, but I guess I gotta wait

437
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,220
for E3.

438
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:24,340
Alright, thanks again to Konami for the invitation, and we're looking forward to covering other

439
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:28,740
companies' press events as well, wink wink, nudge nudge, folks, right?

440
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:32,540
Jamie's itching to go to a Capcom thing, I think, so we'll see.

441
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,540
Namco!

442
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,540
Namco!

443
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:40,860
Alright, anyway, Jamie, speaking of Jamie, Jamie, since she unfortunately was not able

444
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:47,680
to go to Gamers' Day, she was at school and at work, and she was also painting and reading

445
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,680
your letters.

446
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,420
Yes, I was also reading letters while I was supposed to be at school.

447
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:58,000
So when you guys send in your emails to Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com, DarkSakura reads

448
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,060
them and throws them away.

449
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,060
And then I laugh at them.

450
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,060
No, just kidding.

451
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:05,980
She brings them Sunday nights to the show with her to read them live on air, at least

452
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:06,980
some select pieces.

453
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:11,220
So Dark Sakura, reach into that mailbag and tell us who wrote us this week.

454
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:18,940
Well, just to go ahead and make a quick statement, I am going to be limiting some of my letters

455
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:24,240
to maybe about the top of, I'd say, six letters that I receive.

456
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,940
So these are tonight's grouping.

457
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,140
These are the lucky few.

458
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:35,460
I'd like to start off with a letter from Simmel, who's one of our UK listeners.

459
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:41,980
So just to let you know, in the UK, we have Go Sudoku for PSP, it's a multiplayer and

460
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,980
downloadable puzzle.

461
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:43,980
Best of all, it's only £20.

462
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:48,080
Oh, sorry, we were talking about Sudoku last week, so I guess they already have a version

463
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,400
of it over there in the UK.

464
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,700
They probably have a cheap one here, I just don't know of it.

465
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:57,020
On average, though, PSP games in the UK are nearly between £35 to £40.

466
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,820
So that's actually a really good price.

467
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,620
I wonder how that compares to how much those books cost.

468
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,540
I'd rather have a PSP game before I have a book.

469
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:07,740
It'd be about like us buying a PSP game for 35 bucks.

470
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:12,460
I just don't see myself buying Sudoku on any system when a god like Tetris is right around

471
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,460
the corner for DS.

472
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,460
You know?

473
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,460
That's just me.

474
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,300
Well also he likes to say that he enjoys listening to the new format and likes how the show's

475
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,300
progressing.

476
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,300
Thank you.

477
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,780
Well thank you!

478
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:27,880
Another letter comes from DJ Ratchet, who's one of our, I think one of our newer people

479
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:33,540
on the forums too, he wants to say that he loves the podcast, thank you, and has questions

480
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:37,780
about Kingdom Hearts 2, estimated release date in the US and if there's really a Tron

481
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:44,500
level. Yes, there is a Tron level! I do have a friend who owns the Japanese release, I'm

482
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:51,740
supposed to be obtaining it shortly myself, and from what I understand, you know, I actually

483
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:56,820
did have the release date, I do believe it's the end of March? 31st, actually it was 29th

484
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:01,980
the 34 I think it's 31st now right I actually I got my date through my

485
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:06,560
resource too but it's good they lining up that's a good sign mine's pre-ordered

486
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:10,200
mines pre-ordered already but not only is there a Tron level there's also a

487
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:16,480
steamboat Willie level which is so adorable there's okay I think that

488
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,920
they're getting into the whole music game thing because the entire undersea

489
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,240
level is like big old working music game

490
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,920
interesting all right you you repeat

491
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,320
little motions and hit your little

492
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,440
button on time and you make sort of sing

493
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,040
along with Ariel and all them and

494
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,000
listening to the Japanese version of

495
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,280
under the sea is freaking hilarious and

496
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,720
the whole what's the song that she sings

497
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,440
when she's in the cave the only world

498
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:49,320
no don't don't ask me okay but it's just

499
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,680
part of their world part of your

500
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:55,960
world is that it something close every Disney song has something about I want

501
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:02,720
to be accepted by the world I'm an outcast and I want to be loved I want to

502
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,320
be accepted by Blizzard I want to be loved in World of Warcraft for the

503
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:11,760
record there is a sixth emo Ranger now okay anyway um yeah but those levels are

504
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:16,600
really on there and he also agrees with my take on the big bully of the gaming

505
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:24,220
industry you evil I'm just moving on Jack Thompson also let's have tea has

506
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:29,260
emailed us and said I love that nickname I love it our listeners and emailers

507
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:33,280
have the best nicknames in the world I mean we had poo face made a comment in

508
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:38,020
the first hour of the show we have let's have tea this is awesome all right but

509
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:43,760
every time I see Xander I think of Buffy I think of drawn together I'm gonna

510
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,680
never-ending quest to save my girlfriend forget it anyway moving on I don't watch

511
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:53,240
TV oh you watch Buffy gotcha I watched Buffy because my friend taped it all

512
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:58,440
right and we would watch it later mailbag mailbag um honestly what's okay

513
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,320
says honestly I want to email you and say thanks for podcasting for the

514
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:05,140
podcast because I'm not usually one to judge by reviews but with you guys I do

515
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:09,260
I picked up a DS because you guys said they are awesome I picked up Animal

516
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:12,920
Crossing DS and Mario Kart DS because of all the hype here about it I just

517
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:16,560
picked up trace memory because the little plug for it on episode 170 and

518
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,880
honestly I wanted to thank you guys for the show and how helpful you guys are

519
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:24,160
wow that's that's amazing wow to know that we're actually influencing how

520
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,040
people spend their hard-earned money that's that's a hell of a compliment

521
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:32,720
thank you it's a little light in my dark soul I know that's great there's a light

522
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,880
sorry you haven't you had me on musicals so forget it moving on

523
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,600
Pendragon writes in and says

524
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,800
this is support for a Loki's whole PC

525
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,880
fetish. Oh, we have a Loki supporter! Yeah.

526
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,840
Oh, you have to admit it's about time. We've heard the anti end of it

527
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,760
so now we need to hear the pro end of it. We're fair.

528
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,720
We're fair and balanced, Radio. It's not what it looks like, but how it

529
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,600
actually works and performs. We'll see about the new Intel mechs. Honestly, this

530
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,920
pretty interface looks

531
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:06,320
will bog the system down and overall will not be as fast as the PC. I'm a 3D graphic artist

532
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,920
and I wouldn't bother with the Mac. You want to know what, okay? You are obviously not

533
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:16,920
a professional graphic artist, because just about any professional will use a Mac, and

534
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:25,520
the Intel Macs are clocked to be much faster than their equivalent PC. Which is why I'm

535
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,520
getting one!

536
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:31,600
This PC Mac thing is so 2005. I'm done. I'm done.

537
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,600
I can't wait until I get it.

538
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,840
Stop sending emails on it. I don't care.

539
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:41,840
I can't wait until I get started broadcasting from my Mac because now the new iLife 6 has instant podcast support.

540
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,840
Will you be broadcasting in flavors?

541
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,840
Yes, I will have a great...

542
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,840
Stop! Stop egging this whole thing off!

543
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,840
Just sit down and shut up and take it like a man!

544
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,840
My show tastes like purple!

545
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,840
Alright, next email!

546
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,840
I'm going to podcast in a black like my soul flavor.

547
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:03,660
okay um Raphael writes in and says I am going to try not to rant about this but

548
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,980
here we go usually that means there's a rant following the one thing that I find

549
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,980
very amusing is that religious people say how bad and evil video games are

550
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:16,900
however they had even taken the smallest amount of time to read summaries of the

551
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:21,780
game they would realize that the most games promote some of their morals such

552
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:26,220
as friendship love peace tolerance etc just it just proves that most of this

553
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:30,560
Most of the religious people in the media have blind, ignorant hate, which true Christians

554
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,560
would frown upon.

555
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,740
However, I would like to note that not all Christians are like this, and not all video

556
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:39,360
games deserve to be defended, such as games with blood, gore, dot dot dot, though this

557
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,460
is only my personal view, as I would rather play Animal Crossing than shoot someone and

558
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,980
laugh as their stomach explode.

559
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:49,220
Okay, again, I have a problem, and I'm sure the emailer didn't intend to do this, but

560
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:53,820
I have a problem with the generalization of religious people, because you can be religious

561
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,220
and not be a moron.

562
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:59,160
easily possible I have many I know that I know but I'm just I just wanted to

563
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:08,000
clarify as well but you know moving on moving on I'm sorry I was taking a

564
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,800
moment to savor my caffeine I do appreciate the perspective though he's

565
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,560
right you know because it makes me think of something and this has nothing to do

566
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,520
with games but TV so dark soccer just tune out for a minute there was this

567
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:22,880
show on TV recently called book of Daniel on NBC and it it got this huge

568
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:28,280
huge flack from, you know, just the bad apples of the religious world that said, you know,

569
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,940
it's sacrilegious and dah, dah, dah.

570
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:33,780
But if you actually took time to watch the show, you'd see that it actually, it portrayed

571
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:40,900
the flashes or whatever the guy was having of Jesus or whatever.

572
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:45,860
Jesus was portrayed in a very, you know, moral light and had these very profound and pro-religious

573
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:50,220
things to say that I thought were very provocative.

574
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:54,600
And you could tell that people that were campaigning against this show had never watched an episode

575
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,000
of it and just took what they saw at face value.

576
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,360
And the show got pulled and cancelled.

577
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,400
Yeah, I was going to say, it's funny you mentioned never watching the show because I think a

578
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,000
lot of people never watched the show and so it got cancelled.

579
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,680
So anyway, take that to video games and apply it.

580
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,680
Anyway.

581
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:13,160
It just goes to show the blind leading the, you know, brainless and blind.

582
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,920
I got an email from one of our listeners,

583
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,280
uh, Sithsmon.

584
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,720
Actually, three bits to bring up. I'll go ahead and, uh,

585
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:27,800
I'll paraphrase this a little bit, but I'll go ahead and read some of it. Interesting bit number one,

586
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,280
you can now listen to OLR and the other podcasts if you have a TiVo and broadband connection.

587
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,200
I heard about TiVo podcasts. That's so awesome. I would love to see

588
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,600
our show on TiVo. Like, take a picture of your TV and send it, because I want to frame it.

589
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:44,460
The article is located at publications.mediapost.com

590
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:49,140
The URL is really long, so I'll just say look for it there

591
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:55,200
He set OLR up and works great, even displays our logo on the TV

592
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,700
Sweet, that's awesome

593
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,820
Send us a picture, I want to see that. Yeah, I would really like to see a picture of that

594
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:03,080
I have TiVo knock off on my TV, I have Comcast

595
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,000
Not TiVo

596
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,300
Interesting bit number two, not sure if you mentioned this yet, recently PC Gamer

597
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:13,900
out that they will no longer use advertisements for items and gold farming services.

598
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:19,460
The article is at www.next-gen.biz.

599
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:23,560
Gamers that play MMOs just want to know what we think about that.

600
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,540
He says his opinion is that this is a great idea.

601
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:30,940
Not so much because it will put farmers out of business, but because it's a big statement

602
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:34,260
that gamers are getting really sick of these game-ruining services.

603
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:38,340
I heard about it, and I think we were considering it for inclusion in previous podcasts, but

604
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:47,660
we were out of time, and I support the move, you know, and I don't know, I guess that's

605
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,800
all I really have to say.

606
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,300
There's also the last thing is that last week I got an email from Sony asking me to participate

607
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,260
in a PSP beta for Seif and Fielder Dark Mirror.

608
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,900
Basically go to a site, fill out a form, and they mail you a UMD.

609
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:00,900
The catch?

610
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:05,220
up using the PSP browser and you need the newest firmware, 2.6. I hit up the site about

611
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,820
10 hours after I got the email and quickly got a message saying they already had all

612
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:14,420
the beta participants they needed. The beta is full less than a day after the email, WTF.

613
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:18,900
Couple things to touch on that. One, you didn't need the 2.6 firmware. You could spoof it

614
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:24,380
and it's no problem. Two, it's not going to really matter anymore, which we'll cover later.

615
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,380
Alright.

616
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:29,980
Well, what do you think about that? It was a very limited beta. Knowing that thousands

617
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:36,820
of gamers would try to update their PSP to 2.6 to sign up for a siphon filter game that's

618
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:42,700
a lot there was also another beta that's going on right now actually for pursuit force which

619
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:50,060
is going out to also people are members of the playstation.com of course they select

620
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:57,380
a few of them that participate so all right any other emails there is actually one more

621
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:02,980
Just because it needs to be said and also I do want to go in and thank Rob Way for the the

622
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,180
article about the

623
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:12,420
Game writing. Oh sweet from the first half of the show because he's the one who gave me that little bit of knowledge

624
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:21,980
One of our writers John Blanco said that he didn't get bored of Nintendogs just recently acquired

625
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:27,420
50,000 trainer points all dogs and interior decorations are now unlocked

00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,460
crack.

631

There you go.

632
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,460
Mm-hmm.

633
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,460
I'm almost out.

634
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,460
I'll have you know Taco.

635
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,460
But we remember what Foamy has to say about this.

636
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:59,100
Taco is in the to-be-sold pile for GameStop right now.

637
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:07,260
So is Ayn, Minchi, and my Dalmatian, who I forgot what I named.

638
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,780
Alright, so that's it for the emails?

639
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,780
Yep.

640
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:14,820
Send your emails to mailbag at orangelaunsradio.com and we try to read, we definitely read them

641
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:19,420
all, try to respond to them all, and read as many as we can in any given week.

642
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,420
So we love getting emails.

643
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,420
I've got a ton.

644
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,420
It inflates our egos and makes us feel loved.

645
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,420
I don't mind.

646
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,420
I will take the top six.

647
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:29,420
Alright, moving on, we're running way over tonight.

648
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:33,780
Our first thing went on for 90 minutes, we're going to try and lightning round through the

649
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,180
last few articles we have here tonight.

650
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,980
We've got a lot, but we still want to talk about stuff.

651
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:41,420
One person who we can't seem to avoid a story on every week is Yui Bol.

652
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,700
Loki, what the hell is he doing now?

653
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:50,980
more of what he's not doing. What he's not doing is working on Metal Gear Solid. So that's

654
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:58,300
always good. He says, look, I'm super busy right now. I can only do three movies in two

655
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:04,340
years. So earlier I said I could do Hitman or Metal Gear Solid before 2007. Not that

656
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:08,980
they would give you the rights to it anyways, you jackass. So, you know, he's not doing

657
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:12,840
it and his next piece of crap that's coming out is done or is in the name of

658
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:17,580
King dungeon sees movie better known as we ripped off Lord of the Rings for the

659
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:23,140
entire thing and it sucks look for that coming in November oh in two parts by

660
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:31,780
the way oh and what what's he made on a blood rain so far not jack $20 so you

661
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:37,780
know hopefully these these studios will learn so yeah I'm very happy to hear

662
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:42,160
about that so hooray and there is hope after all for the Metal Gear Solid movie

663
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,440
so you know actually I think I think that news just made it because no we're

664
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,320
on a little bit of delay on the stream here that news just made it over to our

665
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:57,120
chat room that's right all right moving on we talked a lot about DDR earlier in

666
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:02,440
the show West Virginia who knew that West Virginia still made the news once

667
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:07,120
in a while I'm teasing I'm teasing West Virginia actually they had a partnership

668
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:14,840
with Konami to put Dance Dance Revolution in 753 public schools that

669
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:18,640
will be all of them within the next three years it was a pilot project that

670
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,620
started last spring and they're actually going to incorporate it into schools I

671
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:27,560
think that's kind of interesting so and that's being helped funded by Konami as

672
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:31,440
well as you know all the usual grants and stuff so they're playing ultra mix I

673
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,640
don't know which one by now they're doing ultra yeah in the little of this

674
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,760
clip here you can see on yahoo news where I pulled it from actually this

675
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,560
particular one they're playing extreme well that's a lie when they actually

676
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:48,680
play it because it's ultra mix all right let's see why are they doing this here

677
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:53,280
health promotions manager Nydia Henderson manager for the public

678
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,440
employees insurance program says one out of three children born in West Virginia

679
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,440
today will have diabetes by the time they grow up this is devastating

680
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,720
statistic and not acceptable so essentially they're trying to make

681
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:09,280
fitness fun and get kids into it via DDR which I think is pretty awesome and to

682
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,560
make people not afraid of West Virginia. I remember what I said earlier about

683
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:19,060
obesity being basically pandemic you know I applaud their efforts in trying

684
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:22,500
to get kids active. I tried to be a little bit of a fly on the wall at

685
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,540
Konami's gamer day and I picked up a little interesting tidbit all I can say

686
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:29,420
is this won't be the last of it that you hear this won't be the last. You know a lot of

687
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:32,980
independent schools in California are doing the same just on their own just

688
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,980
buying the machine and making it part of their gym program.

689
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,980
Why can't I know this stuff and I work for Konami?

690
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:41,980
Because they keep you locked away in a cabinet, slaving away on...

691
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,980
Whatever game I'm on at the time.

692
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:44,980
I know, I can't say.

693
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:49,980
It doesn't matter, even if you did know it, you'd be under some sort of NDA, so...

694
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,980
At least I would know!

695
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,980
That's the important part.

696
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:56,980
That's pretty sad that a Konami employee is getting filled in here on our program.

697
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:57,980
Yeah.

698
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,980
I didn't get to go to Gamers' Day, even. I had to work.

699
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:03,120
You missed our whole coverage too, you were out at the coffee...

700
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:06,120
Starbucks, Gamers' Day coverage, come on.

701
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:10,880
Alright. Moving on, let's talk about another music-based game. This one is an MMO.

702
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,720
What the hell, Loki?

703
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:15,200
Yeah, it's actually, of course, yet another

704
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,560
great MMO coming from Koreans. It's actually called

705
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,560
Dance Audition, and it's

706
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:26,400
pretty sweet, really hard from what I hear, because I have yet to play it,

707
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:33,400
unfortunately. But basically it kind of resembles a Space Channel 5 type of game where you match

708
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:40,580
the movements on the screen. Choo! Choo! Choo! Anyways, so it includes, you know, they have

709
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:47,020
different things. It's also kind of got a little bit of ode to jam type of feel to it

710
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:51,900
where you can, you know, soup up your avatars with different items that you win by earning

711
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:55,980
credits and stuff and learn new moves, songs, etc.

712
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:59,480
If you want to check this out, they're actually doing a free beta on it right now.

713
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:03,480
It's au.bugsgames.net.

714
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,300
I want to say that was headlined on our site earlier this week, so it should have a link

715
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,300
there too.

716
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,300
orangehomesradio.com.

717
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:11,300
Much easier to remember.

718
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:15,420
Alright, now audition something that can be played worldwide, yes?

719
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,420
Yes.

720
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,300
So that would include our friends in the UK.

721
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:22,720
however you do want to have Internet Explorer for you know signing up on the

722
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:27,160
site and everything because it only works in Internet Explorer. Worst game ever. No love

723
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:31,920
for Firefox. Worst game ever. Alright anyway I was trying to do a segue into the UK

724
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,120
news that you completely interrupted so uh. Sorry. Dark Sakura. My segue's ruined.

725
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:42,760
UK news. What's up in the UK? Lots of stuff. First off there is a crash day demo

726
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:52,140
from Atari put out for PC PS2 and Xbox and the download is actually up on

727
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:57,040
Eurogamer if you go to their home page there's a link to the demo I love

728
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:03,680
Eurogamer but basically the game is a combination of racing stunts and big ol

729
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:08,560
weapons so you can make big I like the quote here big smashy messes and design

730
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,720
your own tracks demo includes a wrecking match event and a stunt show event and

731
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:17,080
And you can even try out the multiplayer mode via either LAN or internet.

732
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:21,120
You can only launch the demo 50 times though, so be warned.

733
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:25,520
The official release date is February 24th.

734
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:31,760
Also for our listeners in Australia, we never forget you guys.

735
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,680
The Xbox 360 has been delayed.

736
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:38,480
We have some in chat right now too, and it's gotta be a crazy hour over there right now,

737
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,480
so...

738
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,480
It's something in the morning, isn't it?

739
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:45,400
you early early birds in Australia tuning in love ya thank you for hanging

740
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:52,840
out with us and the console was supposed to launch on March 2nd the date has been

741
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:58,960
delayed to March 23rd Microsoft said that the slip-up was due to and I quote

742
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,320
unprecedented global consumer demand in short-term manufacturing issues due to

743
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:06,960
component shortages stemming from challenges in rampant supplies meaning

744
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:13,400
Also, according to Microsoft, the launch date ensures that the markets will have an adequate

745
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:18,060
supply of Xbox 360 consoles to meet demand at launch, so maybe they're trying to learn

746
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,960
from their little mess-up with us.

747
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,760
Just to clarify, Deke Mann, who's our friend down under in chat right now, says it's actually

748
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:29,600
only 3 p.m. over there, so that's not too bad.

749
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:37,320
They also though expect to sell between 4.5 million and 5.5 million units by July.

750
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:44,420
Also there was the mention too that demand is completely overpowering supply everywhere.

751
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:49,920
Microsoft said that they've lowered their 90 day sales forecast.

752
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,920
So yeah, they got a little bit ahead of themselves, huh?

753
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,880
Does everywhere not include Japan anymore?

754
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,200
Japan, they've only sold 100,000.

755
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,200
Yeah.

756
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,280
yeah that's not surprising also

757
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:05,640
you know I'm sure people who know me know I have a lot of love for SNK

758
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:09,380
I have a Neo Geo I have versions of

759
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:12,720
I have King of Fighters the fact that you bought a Neo Geo is hardcore right there

760
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,600
actually my my husband traded a Sega CD for it

761
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:19,360
and now we have another Sega CD

762
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:23,720
but this was a while back

763
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:27,320
Xbox

764
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:33,880
is getting KOF Neowave which is basically the same three on three

765
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:38,600
you know fighting team you have twelve three person teams you've also got

766
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:42,040
you know included are the women's teams with my King and Yuri

767
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:45,220
the Fatal Fury team with Terry Joe and Andy

768
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:49,380
you've got a tournament mode there's also three modes of play

769
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:53,900
I don't really get what these are they're super cancel guard break and max 2

770
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:58,340
excuse me, plus a new heat mode that lets you power up attacks in exchange for

771
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:00,020
gradual loss of health.

772
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:03,500
Also there's screenshots up on Eurogamer so you might want to check them out.

773
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:07,860
Also mention if you are a King of Fighters fan, King of Fighters

774
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:11,900
94 Rebound came out a couple weeks ago actually

775
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:15,420
for the Xbox as well. I've got KOF

776
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:18,500
95 on Saturn where you have

777
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:22,860
if you've got a US Saturn you have to do this thing where you put in your loading cart

778
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:26,140
change output in the RAM cart real quick. One of the, I think, three

779
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:30,700
Saturn games that runs on a RAM cart. Half the game is on cartridge, which doesn't

780
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:31,820
help the load time any anyway.

781
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:36,380
Um, also release dates. I actually have two sets of release dates.

782
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:40,580
Um, we have our, uh, UK release dates and Australian release dates.

783
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:44,540
So, let's go ahead and go through the rest of, uh, January, shall we?

784
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:47,740
Um, coming up on,

813
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:57,140
I don't know all right anyway moving on let's let's go over to Loki who has some

814
00:50:57,140 --> 00:51:02,180
news about the PSP yeah actually earlier I was going to cover that they had

815
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:11,520
figured out how to load all homebrew for versions 2.01 and 2.5. They were 90% done earlier today

816
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:15,220
with getting 2.6 to work and apparently while we were doing this show they had already broke

817
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:20,820
the news that they've cracked, no, figured it out for 2.6. So now every version currently

818
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:28,720
of the PSP can run homebrew. Now these latest ones, everything from 2.01 up to 2.6 require

819
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:36,560
Grand Theft Auto using it, the glitch or hack that was with the save files to load an e-boot

820
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,560
loader.

821
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,520
And that's kind of how everything is working right now.

822
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,780
Some programs are working, some aren't.

823
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:46,060
So if you don't have Grand Theft Auto and aren't planning to get one, you probably should

824
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:49,920
not think twice about upgrading to 2.6.

825
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:55,920
However, new games that are coming out right now will require you to upgrade to 2.5 at

826
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:01,800
least, and some I hear are actually 2.6 now, so something to think about.

827
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,360
That's all late-breaking ass we're taping right now.

828
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,560
Yeah, pretty much, yeah.

829
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:08,720
So you can find that stuff on PSP updates.

830
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:13,640
Deepin pointed out that the 2.6 was done, so that was kind of cool.

831
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:14,640
Awesome.

832
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,900
All right, moving on, let's go to another topic here.

833
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:20,520
This is something completely different, you know, I like to browse the various gaming

834
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:23,920
websites out there, kind of seeing what's popular, and one of them I scan on a regular

835
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:31,800
basis is Joystiq. Joystiq had a story this week about a gallery of video game endings

836
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:37,240
and it's mostly for classic 8 and 16-bit game endings. You can actually check it out. It's

837
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:43,000
the Video Game Museum at VGmuseum.com and they mention in this story a lot of endings.

838
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:48,680
Sonic the Hedgehog, What Happens If You Never Were Able to Beat Strider, and of course games

839
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:53,480
that we all remember such as Metroid and things like that. I thought I'd bring that up here

840
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:59,540
in studio, what video game endings do you remember that are so memorable that you love?

841
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:00,540
Dark Sakura.

842
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:05,540
Ryu's ending on Super Street Fighter II with him just walking and the music playing.

843
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:07,100
Street Fighter II had some good endings, it did.

844
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,740
It was cool how every character kind of had a different one.

845
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:15,080
I remember how slow it was, you know Street Fighter Alpha 2 came out on the Super Nintendo.

846
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:20,720
Only cartridge I had played with loading time, excuse me, and it was like the scenery would

847
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:21,720
pop up.

848
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:27,200
Yeah, you kind of need them to play don't you but I actually got my first screenshots for my old website

849
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:32,040
Dark soccer is mostly evil shrine from the Super Nintendo. I think I've been to that website

850
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,800
That was still up. It's gone

851
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:41,120
Geo cities finally deleted it. You need to have a spin-off of orange. I've saved the pages. There you go

852
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:45,800
We should put it up for nostalgia value. We'll put it up. All right, it's with with its background MIDI's and all

853
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:51,800
Yeah, it was crappy. But I hand coded it. I hand coded my sites back then.

854
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,800
Other great endings. Loki, Miklotov, anything you want to add?

855
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,800
Personally, I liked the ending of Final Fantasy VIII. I don't know.

856
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,800
A lot of people didn't like that game. I thought it was pretty good.

857
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,800
The ending was cool with selfie and the camera.

858
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,800
Final Fantasy IX, though. That game sucked.

859
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:08,800
Miklotov?

860
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:13,800
Silent Hill 2. So sad and depressing. I loved it.

861
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:14,800
Which ending?

862
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,880
the one I consider to be the true ending the dog inning right

863
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,720
no believe ending yeah yeah the one I saw

864
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:25,120
the with the with the letter at the end yeah yeah that all

865
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:28,520
because there's also the I hate myself and when I went yeah

866
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:32,620
there's the one where he does die the one where other things happen

867
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:35,880
I don't do spoilers nevermind I

868
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:39,120
anything else you want to add there's a couple that writer mm-hmm

869
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:42,120
I have actually beaten Strider hardcore

870
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:46,120
any given Mega Man game. Yes. Especially two, I remember that.

871
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:50,920
Games I remember, especially from the 8-bit days, Super Mario Brothers 2,

872
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:54,520
the Dallas OMG it was all a dream thing.

873
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:57,920
Who can forget that one? Of course Metroid, classic there.

874
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,280
I think my favorite though would be Final Fantasy IV, Final Fantasy II on

875
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,460
Super Nintendo in the US.

876
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:06,240
Classic. I love it. I loved it. Someone, why are you shaking your hand at that?

877
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,840
I loved it. Because I just recently played it again on the Game Boy Advance.

878
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:16,560
And it was okay the one for Final Fantasy 6 was really good, but you have to wait for a shadow to live

879
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:23,520
Let's see I'm looking at the chat chat room over at orange launch radio.com click on chat and seeing what they're saying in here

880
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,200
PK Akira 88 says act razor

881
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,640
That's a good one

882
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,000
SSJ 100 Matt chrono trigger which anything and yeah

883
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:37,800
It's done follow that up with well. It has what like 25 endings

884
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:42,800
Let's see, and VXChase and XV says, stop spoiling Silent Hill 2.

885
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,800
Haha, whatever.

886
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:48,800
Actually, I have to say that my favorite of the Chrono Trigger endings is, okay,

887
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,800
after you have become sufficient enough level where you do New Game Plus,

888
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:56,800
and you beat the game immediately upon setting onto the teleporter,

889
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:00,800
you get the designer ending where they each leave you a comment

890
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,800
and one of the people you meet is Toriyama.

891
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:06,800
Wasn't one of the endings where the girls would rate the guys in the game?

892
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:10,800
I don't think I got that one. I did get the one where

893
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:15,860
They did something before they got frog in the party and frog ended up being

894
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:23,260
Marvel's ancestor and she started croaking. Yeah, that's such good ending. Let's see. I'm looking at some other ones here

895
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:27,520
We've got Dark Knight yelling for a Shenmue. No, cuz it's a horrible game

896
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:30,800
poof aces half-life 2 because the cliffhanger and

897
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:35,340
and let's see, somebody said, oh Pooface also said Halo 2 is the worst ending

898
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:38,600
MiniMe283 says Zelda Ocarina of Time

899
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:42,360
Yeah, that had a good ending. Good stuff, good stuff you guys

900
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:45,840
Alright, let's go ahead and move on again if you want to check out that website with

901
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:46,600
classic

902
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:49,800
not everything in there is considered classic so you may not find them all

903
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:53,440
VGMuseum.com though for the classic 8 and 16 bit ones

904
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:57,440
No, no, no, one more. What? The Guardian Legend. Shit yeah

905
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,960
Yeah

906
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:04,440
Loki what's going on with Street Fighter? We brought up Street Fighter in the ending stuff. What's going on with the Street Fighter now?

907
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,160
Well, as you remember

908
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:11,600
Was Street Fighter had a collection for it now, they have the Street Fighter alpha collection

909
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:15,880
Which is gonna feature all of these Street Fighter alpha games including

910
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,560
puzzle or not puzzle fighter super gem fighter

911
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,160
Which is gonna be pretty sweet as well

912
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:35,160
They're basically going to also have the survival mode as well as a dramatic battle which allows two-on-one tag team matches.

913
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:41,160
And I believe, I'm trying to remember if they added anything else in there.

914
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:45,160
I think overall it's going to be a pretty cool collection of games.

915
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:57,160
They've also got the Capcom Classic Collection coming out to the PSP pretty soon with a lot of cool games on there.

916
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:02,160
You know what you need to put on one of those anthologies? Cyberbots.

917
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:05,160
That would be interesting.

918
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,160
Alright, what's going on with Splinter Cell, Loki?

919
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:13,160
Splinter Cell? Well, Splinter Cell Essentials is still coming out in March.

920
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:20,400
However, Splinter Cell Double Agent is postponed to September.

921
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:25,140
Much like they did with Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, they're tweaking the game to make

922
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:31,720
sure it's perfect, and they're worried right now that the installed base of Xbox 360 owners

923
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:37,000
might not be what they're hoping for if they release in March.

924
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,780
In other words, Microsoft hasn't sold enough systems to the United States yet.

925
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:45,240
So they are postponing it to September to make sure that they have enough systems out

926
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:50,180
there to make this game still like crazy, because it's going to be probably a must-have

927
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:51,180
game.

928
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:54,080
So, look forward in September.

929
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:59,140
A must-have game on the PSP in some folks' opinion is the new Katamari Damacy that's

930
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,820
going to be coming out on PSP.

931
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:03,980
For those of you guys that are looking for something in the meantime to hold you over,

932
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:07,300
Dark Sakura, do you have a little something, a little collector's item for Katamari Damacy?

933
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:08,300
Kind of?

934
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:09,940
They've made Katamari Damacy checks!

935
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:10,940
They are custom checks.

936
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:11,940
They are so cute.

937
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:12,940
I want some.

938
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:13,940
To pay the rent type checks?

939
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:14,940
Yes.

940
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:15,940
To pay the rent type checks.

941
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:23,940
They are custom checks that have, hello, I am a check, please cash me, lol, Katamari,

942
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:25,940
do your best.

943
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:30,460
Because they have these custom check making services, so somebody just created Katamari

944
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:31,460
checks?

945
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:33,580
I suppose so.

946
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:37,460
It says on there, there is a quote that says, I design them, when you spend money, people

947
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:39,260
should feel happy and also super lucky.

948
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:44,140
This is the most important thing to be contributing to the success for every special day. Do not chase waterfalls

949
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:50,660
PK Akira 88 in our chat room says now I can bounce a check in style. Yeah, you can

950
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:56,060
You can roll up overdraft fees to who knew that Katamari's bounced

951
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:01,300
All right, we're just got a couple more stories left for you guys

952
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:06,980
We are going to take just a couple quick skype line calls right after this so you can call us on our skype line

957
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:28,140
Real quick, I got a story for you guys though, I know we're running a long time, but I just

958
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:29,920
want to bring this up real quick.

959
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:35,220
Another story coming out of West Virginia, a study by researchers at Wheeling Jesuit

960
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:38,860
University the story coming from Gama Sutra or Game Sutra I don't know however

961
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:41,380
you want to pronounce that I like Gama Sutra because it makes it sound dirty

962
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:46,340
it's a study called the effects of video game play types on pain threshold and

963
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:51,020
tolerance interesting the study compared several different genres of games and

964
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:55,420
their effects on pain they used action puzzle arcade fighting sports and boxing

965
01:00:55,420 --> 01:01:00,020
games things that encourage high attention and stimulus the researchers

966
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:05,780
also measured the emotional response to each type. He concluded Dr. Brian

967
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:10,380
Radenbush, the director of undergraduate research, says physicians could possibly

968
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:14,700
implement this in their office to aid in distraction during a painful procedure

969
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:18,460
such as injection or dental work. Video games could also be used in waiting

970
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:22,780
rooms to distract patients from upcoming surgical procedures. This principle, by

971
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:26,260
the way, is one of the driving forces behind child's play, which we talked

972
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:29,700
about earlier in the program, the drive to donate games to Children's Hospital

973
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:35,820
awards very interesting there I'm assuming that the Nintendo DS version of

974
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:40,140
under the knife is not one of those games probably not probably not what do

975
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:43,980
you think is this is this legitimate I I've heard of this video games being

976
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:46,940
used in Dennis office before to distract people I think it's a great idea my

977
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:51,460
dentist has CNN and it's distracting enough you know to kind of keep my mind

978
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:59,100
off of this isn't new I remember being about 13 years old watching something on

979
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:02,600
on the news program where they were using light hypnosis

980
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:04,360
to uh...

981
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:09,220
have people go into a dental surgery without anesthesia

982
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:11,320
uh... they had like a track

983
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:13,220
they were actually testing it out with little children

984
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:14,940
having them follow it and saying hey

985
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:17,460
you know follow the rabbit with your eyes see where it ends up

986
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:20,300
by the time the light would hit the end of the track their surgery should be

987
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:23,820
done

988
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:24,900
interesting

989
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:29,940
I had a few things to follow up with, a few more stories real quick.

990
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:32,340
Just mainly Xbox Live stuff right now.

991
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:38,840
There's going to be an update to the Xbox Live for Call of Duty 2.

992
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:41,900
They're going to have a multiplayer update that's going to be happening I think Monday

993
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:43,280
or Tuesday.

994
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:48,340
And also there's going to be an update for the dashboard which was going to add that

995
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:51,060
feature for webcams and whatnot.

996
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:53,320
So that's going to be coming pretty soon here.

997
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:58,760
Also last week there was a couple things added to the Xbox Live Arcade, Marble Blast Ultra

998
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:02,560
brand new game coming out, it's kind of like your Marble Madness type of game.

999
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:08,280
And then of course the demo for Full Auto hit last week.

1000
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:12,680
So if you don't have that yet, you need to download it, because it's awesome.

1001
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:17,420
Alright, let's go over the Skype line and see what you guys want to add tonight.

1002
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:21,980
Of course remember www.orangelaunchrater.com, click on interact with us and you can get

1003
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:26,500
All the details on how to call us via the skype line such as this person is doing right now. Hello

1004
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:33,220
You're on orange lounge radio. Hi. What's up? Hi. Who's this is Anna from Florida. Hello, Xander from Florida

1005
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:35,700
Who's on a never-ending quest to save his girlfriend, right?

1006
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:38,740
I'm just messing with you. What's up?

1007
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:46,040
You forgot to mention Iko on the game endings. I know I saw you guys shouting that in chat and I totally forgot Iko

1008
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:50,480
Okay, there you hit now you said it. There it is. I go. Yay. All right. Is that all you want to say?

1009
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:58,760
I don't think so. Okay. Well, what else do you want to say then? We're running low on time. What's on your mind?

1010
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:05,240
DDR supernova is underwhelming but was in the groove

1011
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:11,360
Was waiting to bounce that can't we all just get along? Oh, oh

1012
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:17,760
Oh, you know what? Haven't we done enough controversial topics on this show? Did you

1013
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:22,440
have to delve into the DDR versus ITG thing? Come on. Can you agree that Pump It Up is

1014
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:27,880
good though? Can you agree that Pump It Up is good? Yes. Okay, then we can talk about

1015
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:37,320
that and be happy. But no ITG DDR. All right, Xander. Xander, I'm letting you go because

1016
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:40,520
you're trying to start fights. But have a good one. Thanks for calling. I'm just joking

1017
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,520
I know you are take care Xander

1018
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:48,800
Okay, speaking of which pump it up zero ships the US arcades February 1st. Heck. Yeah, Dave and Busters. I gotta be there

1019
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:51,220
Hello, you're on orange lounge radio

1020
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Hey, what's up? Hi

1021
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,480
Hi

1022
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:04,660
first-time caller, long-time listener, radio, whatever, am I breaking up to you guys?

1023
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:07,440
You are breaking up a little bit, but go ahead and get your question out and we'll answer

1024
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:08,440
it.

1025
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,620
I have a question.

1026
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:19,640
I think I can explain this video games, like taking away the pain, like that article you

1027
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:23,580
guys are talking about on 1UP or whatever you found.

1028
01:05:23,580 --> 01:05:30,580
So when you're playing a video game, if you're focused enough on it, it has to be a certain

1029
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:35,740
type of video game in which you're constantly focused or else you're going to lose.

1030
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:40,560
Something like WarioWare would be most effective for it because the game completely changes

1031
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:42,240
every five seconds.

1032
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,460
If you're not totally focused on it, you're going to die.

1033
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:51,180
And if you're focused on something else, then wow, we get some feedback here.

1034
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:52,180
It's kind of distracting.

1035
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:58,100
That's alright, that's alright, you are cracking up a little bit there, I gotta go ahead and

1036
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:01,300
let you go buddy, but thanks for the call, appreciate it, and your perspective there

1037
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:07,620
on the pain management story there, and talking about a game like WarioWare would be most

1038
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:10,900
effective because it's, you know, kind of like in little, it really holds your attention

1039
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:13,820
because you really have to pay attention to that game because it's throwing all these

1040
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:17,580
random things at you, so that makes sense, and I think that's why they only use certain

1041
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:21,420
types of games in the study too, to kind of show which ones would be the most effective,

1042
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:23,260
and not Trauma Center under the knife,

1043
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:24,500
because that would not be a good choice.

1044
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:26,000
Ah, what are they doing to me?

1045
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,660
Hahaha, alright, thank you guys so much

1046
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:31,780
for your calls on Skype, we gotta keep it short tonight,

1047
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:34,580
I'm very, very sorry, but we are like so out of time,

1048
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:38,180
you guys, but we do have one more thing for you guys.

1049
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:40,140
How could we forget our newest segment here

1050
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:41,780
on Orange Lounge Radio?

1051
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:44,520
Dark Sakura's Website of the Week.

1052
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:47,020
["Dark Sakura"]

1053
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:49,220
Dark Sakura, what's the website of the week this week?

1054
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:51,220
The Oregon Trail Online.

1055
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:56,180
I'm actually I'm wearing my you have died of dysentery shirt right now. I need a life journal like my dad saw it

1056
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:57,660
It's cute

1057
01:06:57,660 --> 01:06:59,820
Just to read the first paragraph of this page

1058
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:02,880
Remember the old Oregon Trail used to play as a kid

1059
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:08,040
Well, we took the best part of the old Oregon Trail the hunting and turned it into the new age 3d hunting game

1060
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:14,300
Our game is packed with squirrels deer and Buffalo the game contains changing scenery and moving clouds

1061
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:16,800
There's even a trade function so you can purchase more bullets

1062
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:19,540
this was made with

1063
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:25,380
Macromedia director 10 the models are made using 3ds max 5.1. They actually put up all their stuff on there

1064
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:27,780
Textures were done in photoshop 7

1065
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:29,780
um

1066
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:32,980
I I actually I think it's pretty cool that they put up what they did behind us

1067
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:35,060
It's just you know for fans of the game

1068
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:38,580
Honestly, I tried to play it and it was a little eh to me

1069
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:40,740
But I still think the concept is cool

1070
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:45,300
And i'm glad that someone has recognized the importance of oregon trail to our gaming heritage

1071
01:07:45,300 --> 01:08:06,300
This is located at Woz.comtechlab.msu.edu slash courses slash 447SP04 slash Oregon Trail.

1072
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:11,300
Post that in chat and post it on the forum so our listeners can find it.

1073
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:12,300
Good timing.

1074
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:13,300
You timed that right at the end of the song.

1075
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:19,100
I am so great radio high-five. Oh, right. I'm not a radio loser. We could we could do this for real

1076
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:26,020
All right, that's it that's the end of show my gosh you guys we did I think about three hours worth the show tonight

1077
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:28,060
Just under three hours worth the regular show. Oh

1078
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:32,100
Busy show controversial show emails

1079
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:36,940
But smoking is bad and I don't smoke. That's right. All right moving on

1080
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:40,180
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought me Glattov. Thank you for being here

1081
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:42,380
or at least the small portion of the show you were here.

1082
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:43,220
I appreciate it.

1083
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:44,040
You're welcome.

1084
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:44,880
Your final thought?

1085
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:45,820
I don't have one.

1086
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:47,340
Loki, your final thought?

1087
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:53,380
I gotta get home to watch some ripped copies

1088
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:55,240
of the new family guy.

1089
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:56,580
Hopefully a new family guy.

1090
01:08:56,580 --> 01:08:58,060
There better be a new family guy.

1091
01:08:58,060 --> 01:08:59,660
My final thought is,

1092
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:02,340
what is up with those World of Warcraft style Google Maps?

1093
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:04,900
Some people have way too much free time on their hands.

1094
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:06,460
That was an article that did make the cut tonight,

1095
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:07,540
but it's interesting.

1096
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:09,380
We talked enough wow tonight.

1097
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:10,680
Dark Sakura, your final thought.

1098
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:12,600
I have to go home and doctor my resume

1099
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:14,000
because I have an interview tomorrow.

1100
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:14,920
Ooh, good luck with that.

1101
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:16,280
And I'm a vegetarian now.

1102
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:19,920
Warlord of the Universe is the position

1103
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:20,840
you're applying for, or what?

1104
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:23,000
You know, I've been doing this job already.

1105
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,640
I may as well have the official title, you know?

1106
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:28,960
All right, that's it, you guys.

1107
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:31,320
Thanks so much for tuning in and listening to us this week,

1108
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:32,720
and we'll be back next week.

1109
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:35,140
Next week on the program, no special guests yet,

1110
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:37,340
but we are trying to get someone on the show next week,

1111
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:38,360
so I don't wanna say who just yet,

1112
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:42,440
But we're trying to get someone very closely connected with the Silent Hill franchise.

1113
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:46,380
We're excited to get that person on, so we'll see if we get that.

1114
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:47,380
It's me!

1115
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:48,380
No, it's not.

1116
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:49,380
No, it's not.

1117
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:50,380
All right, and that's it.

1118
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:54,840
So stay tuned for that, and of course all the controversy and humor that you've come

1119
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:57,560
to expect from your buddies here at Orange Lounge.

1120
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,200
Until next week, have a good one!

1121
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:00,200
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1122
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,200
Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge Production.

1123
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:18,400
See you next week!
