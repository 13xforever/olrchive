4
00:00:19,984 --> 00:00:26,745
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 172 for this, January the 29th of 2006.

5
00:00:27,466 --> 00:00:30,486
[SPEAKER_03]: And quite a busy first half there.

6
00:00:30,746 --> 00:00:32,267
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of controversy.

7
00:00:32,687 --> 00:00:35,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Was there a single controversial subject we didn't touch there in the first half?

8
00:00:35,607 --> 00:00:36,187
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.

9
00:00:36,247 --> 00:00:41,548
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about politics, sexuality, fast food, everything.

10
00:00:41,568 --> 00:00:43,869
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't talk about midget rights.

11
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:45,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe in this half.

12
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:46,149
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

13
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,310
[SPEAKER_08]: There need to be more midget gamers.

14
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:55,473
[SPEAKER_03]: For those that are listening to this on the podcast feed who haven't heard the first half of the show yet, definitely go back and download the first half.

15
00:00:55,834 --> 00:00:57,654
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good show, so check it out.

16
00:00:58,355 --> 00:01:02,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, we're going to get back in because we have a lot of stuff to talk about in this half of the show.

17
00:01:04,878 --> 00:01:08,940
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll start off with Loki, who's got a story about Microsoft.

18
00:01:09,381 --> 00:01:10,561
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on with Microsoft?

19
00:01:10,881 --> 00:01:12,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they doing the handhelds or not?

20
00:01:12,282 --> 00:01:14,063
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a rumor that's been going on for a long time.

21
00:01:14,383 --> 00:01:14,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

22
00:01:15,724 --> 00:01:17,625
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, I think, the official response from

23
00:01:18,725 --> 00:01:29,828
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something that they're looking towards because they want to compete with the iPod and they're looking at maybe starting up a portable gaming development team or something like that or portable something development team.

24
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:31,829
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a maybe.

25
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:34,890
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty much I think what the official word's been.

26
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:40,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Something of course they're going to look at if they can figure out a way to do it profitably.

27
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:48,631
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be one of those things like, okay, well, we'll see what happens, but I'm not going to say yay or nay on it.

28
00:01:48,871 --> 00:01:55,763
[SPEAKER_04]: There's definitely not any firm plans on it, so it's just going to have to wait for that.

29
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:58,728
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

30
00:02:00,468 --> 00:02:05,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on, I have some feedback from the chat room on the controversial subject.

31
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody mentioned that we didn't mention Jack Thompson yet during the program.

32
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Tony mentioned that in the chat room there.

33
00:02:10,611 --> 00:02:11,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank God.

34
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:14,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I should give you guys an update on the Flowers for Jack campaign.

35
00:02:14,211 --> 00:02:17,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember we talked about that last week and how we contributed $20 to that effort?

36
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:17,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what?

37
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:21,213
[SPEAKER_03]: They raised a crazy amount of money.

38
00:02:21,273 --> 00:02:26,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they posted the final figure yet, but when I last checked, they had something like over $900.00.

39
00:02:27,754 --> 00:02:54,475
[SPEAKER_03]: and it got to the point where it was they're going to spend $650 on the flowers and the rest they're donating to and forgive me, I don't have time to dig for this right now I think it's called Child's Play which is the foundation that the Penny Arcade folks set up when they were getting hit with the Jack Thompson stuff too so that's great, it's been a fundraiser in many ways That's a good thing Awesome, so congratulations to the Flowers for Jack folks So now we've mentioned that

40
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:56,440
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

41
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:27,688
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really my F.U.

42
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:31,370
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I actually mentioned it already in the show, but F.U.

43
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,791
[SPEAKER_08]: to that woman at Barnes & Noble.

44
00:03:34,152 --> 00:03:37,114
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, just a big stinking pile of poo on her.

45
00:03:37,814 --> 00:03:48,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if you're going to say excuse me, even if the people haven't heard you, you still wait to acknowledge that they've heard you before shoving somebody out of the way.

46
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:51,322
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, what has happened to the state of manners here?

47
00:03:51,662 --> 00:03:53,624
[SPEAKER_08]: How's that that she had her grandchildren with her?

48
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,241
[SPEAKER_08]: She's teaching them that it is okay to push people out of the way.

49
00:03:58,282 --> 00:04:01,344
[SPEAKER_08]: See, Jack Thompson needs to focus on behavior like that.

50
00:04:02,224 --> 00:04:10,110
[SPEAKER_08]: On just general rudeness and the fact that people go around insulting and will not admit when they were the one who were at fault.

51
00:04:11,531 --> 00:04:11,831
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm done.

52
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:19,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, my FU of the week is going towards, you know, this is basically I have nothing right now.

53
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:22,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Planet Earth for being a cocky bitch.

54
00:04:24,391 --> 00:04:24,732
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

55
00:04:25,693 --> 00:04:27,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, this planet is a cocky bitch.

56
00:04:27,676 --> 00:04:34,044
[SPEAKER_04]: It thinks it's like all, you know, holier than thou just because, you know, it's got life on it or something.

57
00:04:34,104 --> 00:04:34,445
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

58
00:04:35,046 --> 00:04:35,927
[SPEAKER_04]: I got nothing, really.

59
00:04:36,047 --> 00:04:36,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't.

60
00:04:36,387 --> 00:04:37,309
[SPEAKER_04]: My week was okay.

61
00:04:37,549 --> 00:04:39,171
[SPEAKER_04]: I have nothing that really pisses me off.

62
00:04:39,271 --> 00:04:39,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait, I do.

63
00:04:40,153 --> 00:04:40,533
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

64
00:04:40,553 --> 00:04:41,054
[SPEAKER_04]: I take that back.

65
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:48,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck yous, those goddamn people that keep parking in the fire lane, thinking that it's their own personal parking space, even though there's a red curb there.

66
00:04:49,172 --> 00:04:53,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Every goddamn day, there's a car parked there, and nobody tickets these cars.

67
00:04:53,855 --> 00:04:55,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, fuck them, you see?

68
00:04:55,796 --> 00:05:05,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if I want to back out of my car, you know, back out of my space, which happens to be in the corner of this entire parking lot, you know, I have to avoid these people that are parked in these illegal spaces.

69
00:05:06,201 --> 00:05:10,463
[SPEAKER_04]: And the audacity of these people, they actually, you know, look at me like...

70
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:11,409
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

71
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,370
[SPEAKER_04]: You're in my way, you know?

72
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,331
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, fuck them!

73
00:05:15,352 --> 00:05:17,433
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate my apartment complex.

74
00:05:17,453 --> 00:05:19,014
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I knew you had it in you, being a liar.

75
00:05:19,034 --> 00:05:20,695
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also hate her, because she is a cockatoo.

76
00:05:21,826 --> 00:05:29,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, my FU of the week goes to the Italian restaurant in Sacramento, and I'm not even going to name it because nobody outside the area would know it anyway.

77
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,830
[SPEAKER_03]: They gave me food poisoning yesterday.

78
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:35,772
[SPEAKER_03]: My pasta, like I had this dish that was lasagna and pasta, it was like a little bit of both.

79
00:05:36,013 --> 00:05:44,556
[SPEAKER_03]: The pasta was cold, and I should have known that something was wrong then, because that probably means my meat lasagna was undercooked, and I got very, very sick last night, and that's no fun at all.

80
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:45,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Food poisoning sucks.

81
00:05:46,217 --> 00:05:47,798
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, thank you, Jake.

82
00:05:48,308 --> 00:05:49,348
[SPEAKER_03]: You're listening to KTMI.

83
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's change the subject promptly.

84
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:09,899
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

85
00:06:34,117 --> 00:06:40,560
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want you to feel left out, so we have gifts for DarkSakura that we brought back from Gamer's Day.

86
00:06:40,621 --> 00:06:41,461
[SPEAKER_03]: No, stop crying.

87
00:06:41,481 --> 00:06:42,241
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to love these gifts.

88
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:43,922
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a poster.

89
00:06:44,022 --> 00:06:46,343
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Metal Gear Saga poster.

90
00:06:46,844 --> 00:06:47,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Very rare.

91
00:06:47,704 --> 00:06:48,404
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a promotional poster.

92
00:06:48,424 --> 00:06:49,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Metal Gear.

93
00:06:49,085 --> 00:06:49,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

94
00:06:50,045 --> 00:06:51,166
[SPEAKER_03]: And check this out.

95
00:06:51,886 --> 00:06:53,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what I do with press kits.

96
00:06:53,939 --> 00:07:01,746
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to give Jamie the press kit for Metal Gear Saga as well so she can check that out with her husband Dan who's a big Metal Gear fan as well.

97
00:07:02,466 --> 00:07:04,428
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what he was playing today was Gran Turismo 2.

98
00:07:04,788 --> 00:07:05,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

99
00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:06,550
[SPEAKER_03]: That has nothing to do with Metal Gear.

100
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

101
00:07:08,412 --> 00:07:08,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

102
00:07:09,232 --> 00:07:10,013
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't feel left out.

103
00:07:10,033 --> 00:07:10,393
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

104
00:07:10,774 --> 00:07:15,958
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm giving you guys that press kit for a reason so you can report on that for the site too and the stuff blog.

105
00:07:16,038 --> 00:07:17,319
[SPEAKER_07]: It even smells pressy.

106
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:17,740
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

107
00:07:18,843 --> 00:07:23,348
[SPEAKER_03]: So meanwhile, while Jamie's oogling that, Loki and I want to talk about Konami Gamers Day a little bit.

108
00:07:23,368 --> 00:07:27,113
[SPEAKER_03]: But Jamie, feel free to interject your thoughts because you probably have an opinion on these games as well.

109
00:07:27,393 --> 00:07:28,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what did you think of Konami Gamers Day?

110
00:07:28,955 --> 00:07:30,276
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a good time.

111
00:07:30,336 --> 00:07:31,518
[SPEAKER_03]: I loved it.

112
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:37,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much to Konami for inviting us and letting the podcast world get exposure to that as well.

113
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:38,426
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a good time.

114
00:07:39,706 --> 00:07:40,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about some of the games we saw.

115
00:07:41,867 --> 00:07:43,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you check out Tao's Adventure?

116
00:07:43,508 --> 00:07:43,928
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit.

117
00:07:44,468 --> 00:07:46,149
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a role-playing game coming out for the DS.

118
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:46,969
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be out soon.

119
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:48,570
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a little bit.

120
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,891
[SPEAKER_03]: The build that they were showing there, though, was like the full game.

121
00:07:52,231 --> 00:07:55,672
[SPEAKER_03]: So it started me off from the beginning, so it was kind of slow to get into.

122
00:07:55,772 --> 00:07:59,614
[SPEAKER_03]: So I seriously spent like 30 minutes of this game and barely got anywhere.

123
00:07:59,734 --> 00:08:05,116
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I kind of learned that you cast spells by drawing little symbols on the bottom part, and you have to memorize, like,

124
00:08:05,396 --> 00:08:07,577
[SPEAKER_03]: to cast a lightning spell, you draw a little lightning bolt.

125
00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:11,978
[SPEAKER_03]: It seemed okay, but it seemed like kind of like just your average run-of-the-mill RPG.

126
00:08:12,218 --> 00:08:14,299
[SPEAKER_03]: There was nothing about it that really excited me.

127
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:16,120
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you feel the same way, Loki.

128
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was okay.

129
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:24,643
[SPEAKER_03]: I think folks who are into RPGs and it seems like one of those monster collection type of games, you might get a kick out of that.

130
00:08:25,203 --> 00:08:26,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Street Supremacy.

131
00:08:26,603 --> 00:08:29,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what do you think of Street Supremacy, a racing game that's coming out for the PSP by Konami?

132
00:08:29,984 --> 00:08:31,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's actually pretty cool.

133
00:08:31,185 --> 00:08:34,866
[SPEAKER_04]: What it is, it's sort of a port of Tokyo Extreme Racer, so if you've

134
00:08:35,353 --> 00:08:38,854
[SPEAKER_04]: You've played that series, you pretty much kind of have an idea what this game is going to be like.

135
00:08:40,215 --> 00:08:40,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks pretty cool.

136
00:08:40,975 --> 00:08:49,799
[SPEAKER_04]: It reminded me, the comparison I had with it is, it reminded me of Wangdin's Midnight Toon, the arcade game.

137
00:08:49,819 --> 00:08:50,539
[SPEAKER_04]: It reminded me of that.

138
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:52,760
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a pretty good game.

139
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:58,022
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not that many racing games out there for the PSP, so, you know, more the merrier.

140
00:08:58,222 --> 00:09:01,023
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know the price point on it is pretty cheap when it's coming out, so...

141
00:09:01,881 --> 00:09:04,603
[SPEAKER_03]: I ran out of time to check out Street Supremacy, but it looked okay.

142
00:09:04,904 --> 00:09:06,525
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a huge on racing.

143
00:09:06,565 --> 00:09:08,086
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Burnout, but we'll see.

144
00:09:08,226 --> 00:09:08,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll check it out.

145
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,270
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I liked a lot on the PSP was the Gradius Collection.

146
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:13,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet.

147
00:09:13,611 --> 00:09:14,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.

148
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:23,079
[SPEAKER_03]: I played through a little bit of Gradius 1, and it's cool because they changed it a little bit so that it's widescreen, and it doesn't really do it by stretching the image so much.

149
00:09:23,659 --> 00:09:29,163
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it happens a little bit, but they kind of went back and redid it, and you can tell they changed some things about the game, too.

150
00:09:29,244 --> 00:09:29,684
[SPEAKER_03]: For instance...

151
00:09:30,004 --> 00:09:37,086
[SPEAKER_03]: The first boss that you fight happens immediately after the volcano sequence in the first stage, for those of you guys that have played Gradius before.

152
00:09:37,366 --> 00:09:40,087
[SPEAKER_03]: So the volcanoes are in the way while you're trying to fight the boss.

153
00:09:40,107 --> 00:09:42,488
[SPEAKER_03]: So it adds a little bit of extra challenge to it, which I thought was kind of cool.

154
00:09:42,508 --> 00:09:44,448
[SPEAKER_08]: That means you can't sit in the hidey spot, right?

155
00:09:44,548 --> 00:09:45,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, exactly.

156
00:09:45,868 --> 00:09:48,849
[SPEAKER_03]: So they changed that a little bit, and they made it more seamless.

157
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:50,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's a very seamless kind of game.

158
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,451
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only one I checked out, but Gradius Collection is going to have several Gradius games in it.

159
00:09:53,471 --> 00:09:54,391
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what that's going to mean?

160
00:09:54,411 --> 00:09:56,871
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be nine versions of Gradius we own.

161
00:09:57,152 --> 00:09:58,072
[SPEAKER_03]: No Parodius, though.

162
00:09:58,092 --> 00:09:58,132
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

163
00:09:58,952 --> 00:10:00,313
[SPEAKER_08]: That makes me upset.

164
00:10:00,373 --> 00:10:01,454
[SPEAKER_08]: We need more Parodius.

165
00:10:01,754 --> 00:10:02,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe later.

166
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:04,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Rumble Roses XX, Loki.

167
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:05,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you check this one out?

168
00:10:05,477 --> 00:10:06,618
[SPEAKER_03]: This game's all TNA.

169
00:10:07,018 --> 00:10:08,419
[SPEAKER_03]: All TNA.

170
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:14,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Rumble Roses is okay, but the problem I have with this game and wrestling games in general is that it's kind of slow.

171
00:10:15,044 --> 00:10:17,886
[SPEAKER_03]: The action's very slow in these kinds of games.

172
00:10:17,947 --> 00:10:18,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Very slow.

173
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:19,288
[SPEAKER_04]: See, and that's the thing.

174
00:10:19,308 --> 00:10:26,153
[SPEAKER_04]: They were touting that the game had probably the best visuals on the 360, but the movements are all really jerky.

175
00:10:26,653 --> 00:10:26,773
[SPEAKER_04]: D.O.A.

176
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:27,073
[SPEAKER_04]: 4 and D.O.A.

177
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:27,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Beach Volleyball

178
00:10:49,984 --> 00:11:00,334
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting, because I was taking notes during the keynote speeches, and I remember Akari Uchida, who's the producer of Rumble Roses XX, said that they were making fun of DOA a little bit.

179
00:11:00,354 --> 00:11:00,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that?

180
00:11:00,695 --> 00:11:02,517
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, yeah, we're making fun of DOA in this part.

181
00:11:02,857 --> 00:11:04,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they have sequences in the game.

182
00:11:04,118 --> 00:11:10,965
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a photo shoot sequence, like you can take sexy pictures of the folks, and Loki summed it up.

183
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:11,666
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all TNA.

184
00:11:11,866 --> 00:11:13,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's all TNA.

185
00:11:13,528 --> 00:11:13,788
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

186
00:11:14,358 --> 00:11:17,520
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun, and I think it's a party game to me.

187
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be picking it up, for sure.

188
00:11:18,561 --> 00:11:21,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's watch the Super Bowl and play some Rumba Roses.

189
00:11:21,483 --> 00:11:22,264
[SPEAKER_04]: There's what?

190
00:11:22,284 --> 00:11:23,544
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one fighting game for the 360.

191
00:11:23,905 --> 00:11:25,206
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

192
00:11:25,446 --> 00:11:26,266
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to sell.

193
00:11:27,507 --> 00:11:29,008
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a pretty fun game.

194
00:11:29,629 --> 00:11:33,391
[SPEAKER_04]: And definitely, just for the T&A factor, it works.

195
00:11:33,892 --> 00:11:35,793
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll be able to play it online, which I thought was cool.

196
00:11:35,913 --> 00:11:39,235
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can customize your character, including the size of the boobs.

197
00:11:39,776 --> 00:11:42,698
[SPEAKER_03]: And the producer was kind of saying, oh, everybody...

198
00:11:42,998 --> 00:11:48,227
[SPEAKER_03]: It won't just be, you know, anesthesia versus anesthesia and they look the same.

199
00:11:48,527 --> 00:11:51,832
[SPEAKER_03]: You could customize the colors and the size and shape of it.

200
00:11:51,853 --> 00:11:54,457
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm like, okay, on live, they're all going to have huge tits.

201
00:11:54,517 --> 00:11:55,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a creator wrestler?

202
00:11:57,321 --> 00:12:01,363
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that was kind of their response to Create-A-Wrestler instead of being able to create one from scratch.

203
00:12:01,383 --> 00:12:02,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes and no.

204
00:12:02,204 --> 00:12:06,485
[SPEAKER_04]: They do, I think, have a Create-A-Wrestler, and then you can also modify the ones that they have on there.

205
00:12:06,706 --> 00:12:13,068
[SPEAKER_03]: I got the sense that Create-A-Wrestler was more you modify the existing ones significantly, not like Soul Calibur Create-A-Character.

206
00:12:13,409 --> 00:12:13,949
[SPEAKER_03]: A little different.

207
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:14,909
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

208
00:12:15,289 --> 00:12:20,652
[SPEAKER_04]: But the other things that they were going to have, they were a little bit different with it.

209
00:12:21,772 --> 00:12:25,574
[SPEAKER_04]: I know other than the Create-A-Character type stuff, which was pretty cool,

210
00:12:26,035 --> 00:12:26,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Sub... Sub...

211
00:12:54,878 --> 00:12:55,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Sub-sta-nance

212
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,991
[SPEAKER_03]: I like all the add-ons they're going to have for this.

213
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:19,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you get the Metal Gear Saga DVD.

214
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:20,911
[SPEAKER_03]: They were showing clips from that.

215
00:13:20,931 --> 00:13:21,752
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks very cool.

216
00:13:21,792 --> 00:13:25,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, only if you pre-order at a major retailer like GameStop or EV or whatever.

217
00:13:25,713 --> 00:13:26,953
[SPEAKER_04]: But most people are.

218
00:13:26,993 --> 00:13:28,414
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll probably be able to get it either way.

219
00:13:28,734 --> 00:13:31,334
[SPEAKER_03]: And the original Metal Gear on NES and Metal Gear 2.

220
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,555
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

221
00:13:32,655 --> 00:13:33,515
[SPEAKER_07]: The MSX.

222
00:13:33,775 --> 00:13:34,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

223
00:13:34,975 --> 00:13:37,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the one that Kojima pretty much wrote off.

224
00:13:37,096 --> 00:13:37,376
[SPEAKER_03]: What was it?

225
00:13:37,396 --> 00:13:38,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Snake's Revenge?

226
00:13:38,056 --> 00:13:38,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Snake's Revenge, yeah.

227
00:13:38,576 --> 00:13:39,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that one.

228
00:13:39,197 --> 00:13:40,117
[SPEAKER_03]: The real Metal Gear 2.

229
00:13:40,677 --> 00:13:41,437
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that was interesting.

230
00:13:41,778 --> 00:13:43,759
[SPEAKER_08]: The MSX one was actually pretty fun.

231
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:49,521
[SPEAKER_08]: And it had the things that they referred to back in the first Metal Gear Solid about Big Boss and Gray Fox.

232
00:13:50,102 --> 00:13:52,123
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of that was involved in Metal Gear 2.

233
00:13:52,964 --> 00:13:53,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet Coden 5

234
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:19,289
[SPEAKER_03]: is another one I kind of ran out of time to look at, and it's a good thing Miklatov stepped out for a little bit, or he'd probably punch me right now because he loves Suikoden.

235
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you check it out at all?

236
00:14:21,172 --> 00:14:22,554
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a huge Suikoden fan.

237
00:14:22,594 --> 00:14:23,175
[SPEAKER_04]: I looked at it.

238
00:14:23,315 --> 00:14:24,917
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked pretty, but, you know, it's...

239
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,160
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

240
00:14:56,394 --> 00:14:57,794
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I played them.

241
00:14:58,054 --> 00:14:58,455
[SPEAKER_04]: They're cool.

242
00:14:58,755 --> 00:14:59,735
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like the new controller.

243
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:00,935
[SPEAKER_03]: New controller doesn't stick.

244
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:20,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, consider yourself lucky.

245
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,261
[SPEAKER_03]: You still should pick up one of these U.S.

246
00:15:22,281 --> 00:15:22,521
[SPEAKER_03]: controllers.

247
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:25,364
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a mutant controller, and I am going to pick up a U.S.

248
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:25,664
[SPEAKER_04]: controller.

249
00:15:25,684 --> 00:15:30,049
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you do happen to have a controller, the game will be offered with the controller or without the controller.

250
00:15:30,289 --> 00:15:32,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I didn't pick that part out.

251
00:15:32,411 --> 00:15:34,533
[SPEAKER_08]: That means they know we're out there.

252
00:15:35,574 --> 00:15:38,196
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I have the advantage for working at a distributor.

253
00:15:38,376 --> 00:15:44,779
[SPEAKER_03]: For those of you guys concerned about the authenticity compared to the Japanese originals, I'm told that Anothers do show up in the game.

254
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:50,062
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just locked away at the start, but you can unlock the Anothers for those of you guys that really want the difficult stuff.

255
00:15:50,463 --> 00:15:52,784
[SPEAKER_03]: I am hearing they changed some note charts.

256
00:15:53,164 --> 00:15:58,706
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm hearing from folks who play a lot of Beatmania that it's not as bad as you think.

257
00:15:58,986 --> 00:16:07,809
[SPEAKER_03]: They changed note charts, mostly to add in some of the free scratch zones and things, because they are bringing over the free scratch zones, which showed up, I think, in some early, early Beatmania games in the Beatmania 3.

258
00:16:07,869 --> 00:16:08,389
[SPEAKER_03]: They had that.

259
00:16:08,429 --> 00:16:15,372
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed it was in Metal Gear Solid, the remix, because I remember I have Beatmania 2 mix, and I don't remember the free scratching being there.

260
00:16:15,932 --> 00:16:18,214
[SPEAKER_04]: But they added that in there or something.

261
00:16:18,534 --> 00:16:19,255
[SPEAKER_08]: It was in 4th Mix.

262
00:16:19,275 --> 00:16:20,516
[SPEAKER_08]: It was in CM2.

263
00:16:21,097 --> 00:16:32,486
[SPEAKER_08]: It was also, I think, it was removed from, I think, if memory serves me correctly, I do think that it was in 2DX up until, I want to say, the Substream release.

264
00:16:33,027 --> 00:16:34,548
[SPEAKER_08]: The one that linked to DDR2 Mix.

265
00:16:34,628 --> 00:16:34,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

266
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:36,910
[SPEAKER_08]: And then after that, no more.

267
00:16:38,447 --> 00:16:39,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Questions from chat room here.

268
00:16:39,788 --> 00:16:42,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Spirit Snare wants to know, how did the controller feel?

269
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:43,110
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know.

270
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:51,136
[SPEAKER_03]: It felt like the regular controllers to me, but just the key taps were a little different, but nothing that's going to throw you.

271
00:16:51,256 --> 00:16:52,917
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it feels nice.

272
00:16:52,957 --> 00:16:56,099
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the US players are going to be very pleased at the improvements over the Japanese controllers.

273
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:56,519
[SPEAKER_03]: I really do.

274
00:16:56,859 --> 00:16:58,020
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm very excited about that.

275
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:01,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Game Boy One

276
00:17:25,594 --> 00:17:27,316
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, they didn't say specifically.

277
00:17:27,516 --> 00:17:34,427
[SPEAKER_04]: It reminded me of them almost like selling a special features disc for the movie by itself.

278
00:17:34,447 --> 00:17:35,308
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it feels like.

279
00:17:35,748 --> 00:17:39,053
[SPEAKER_08]: They actually did that for Metal Gear Solid 2.

280
00:17:40,509 --> 00:17:42,630
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're actually doing something very similar for Metal Gear.

281
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:46,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Now to bring that up, the Metal Gear comics, they're also going to be doing on the PSP.

282
00:17:46,092 --> 00:17:48,674
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have these comics on the PSP.

283
00:17:48,714 --> 00:17:50,915
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked very well detailed and well drawn.

284
00:17:50,935 --> 00:17:53,636
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked pretty cool and a little bit interactive as well.

285
00:17:53,976 --> 00:17:58,239
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know one thing they were really pushing during the keynotes was innovation.

286
00:17:58,279 --> 00:17:59,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Konami wants to innovate this year.

287
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,921
[SPEAKER_03]: And these two products definitely show that, that they want to be innovative.

288
00:18:02,421 --> 00:18:19,251
[SPEAKER_03]: for me, the deciding factor on the Silent Hill experience is price point because if Silent Hill experience costs as much as a normal PSP game I don't think that's fair because it's not a game but if it's a $20 thing, I think it'll be great and they're not the only ones doing comics either Capcom is getting in on that kind of action as well

289
00:18:20,004 --> 00:18:25,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Metal Gear Acid 2 Metal Gear Acid 2 is pretty good.

290
00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:28,130
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't really care for the first one.

291
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,471
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks pretty fun.

292
00:18:29,851 --> 00:18:34,615
[SPEAKER_04]: I really kind of wanted a Metal Gear Solid game, not really a card battle game.

293
00:18:34,715 --> 00:18:36,516
[SPEAKER_04]: I really hate card battle games.

294
00:18:37,397 --> 00:18:38,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Every single one of them.

295
00:18:38,478 --> 00:18:38,538
[SPEAKER_04]: The

296
00:18:40,689 --> 00:18:46,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Solid Eye wasn't as solid as I thought it was going to be.

297
00:18:46,431 --> 00:18:47,852
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to explain the Solid Eye.

298
00:18:47,952 --> 00:18:55,555
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually a cardboard cutout goggle thing that you can put over your PSP and the game will play in some 3D fashion.

299
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:58,056
[SPEAKER_03]: I had Virtual Boy flashbacks playing this thing.

300
00:18:59,156 --> 00:18:59,996
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't work for me.

301
00:19:00,096 --> 00:19:01,736
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't care for the 3D thing very much.

302
00:19:01,756 --> 00:19:05,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was kind of a cheesy feature, but you can take it off and the game looks fine.

303
00:19:05,697 --> 00:19:09,558
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting because the way it works is that it doesn't ruin the visuals of the game.

304
00:19:09,578 --> 00:19:12,778
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know how much I'd actually use this, the 3D goggle thing.

305
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,199
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a throwaway feature to me.

306
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:20,440
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of cool, but the other thing that I thought was funny, because this was in the Japanese version, they were talking about the sexy girls.

307
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,800
[SPEAKER_04]: They do have a lot of sexy girls.

308
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,841
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I remember seeing a dump of this game online or whatever, and like

309
00:19:27,483 --> 00:19:28,604
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like country music and

310
00:19:51,956 --> 00:19:54,899
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have a very good experience with Curio Revolution.

311
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,881
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very similar to KR Party.

312
00:19:58,082 --> 00:19:59,624
[SPEAKER_03]: It runs on almost the exact same interface.

313
00:19:59,644 --> 00:20:02,226
[SPEAKER_03]: What I thought was interesting is they've added some interesting eye toy features.

314
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:04,849
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how in KR Party you could create a character?

315
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:12,831
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also create a character in the country one, but you can take your own picture on the eye toy and have your face on the character, which I thought was very interesting.

316
00:20:13,331 --> 00:20:14,912
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can also do the eye toy thing.

317
00:20:14,952 --> 00:20:20,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Some backgrounds have big TV monitors, and it'll put you singing in your living room in the TV monitors.

318
00:20:21,777 --> 00:20:23,418
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cheesy, but it's cute.

319
00:20:23,478 --> 00:20:24,559
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it'll be fun.

320
00:20:24,819 --> 00:20:28,062
[SPEAKER_03]: For the party atmosphere of Karaoke Revolution, I think it's cute.

321
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:37,249
[SPEAKER_03]: And whereas I probably won't buy this game because I'm not much of a country fan, I think it's good that they're opening this franchise up to a new audience.

322
00:20:38,229 --> 00:20:40,491
[SPEAKER_03]: And the partnership with CMT as well, smart move.

323
00:20:41,912 --> 00:20:46,876
[SPEAKER_03]: And for my limited knowledge of country songs, it's a pretty good mix.

324
00:20:48,283 --> 00:20:49,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Yu-Gi-Oh!

325
00:20:49,545 --> 00:20:50,205
[SPEAKER_03]: USB.

326
00:20:50,786 --> 00:20:52,148
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little Yu-Gi-Oh!

327
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:54,610
[SPEAKER_03]: game you can put on, or it's Yu-Gi-Oh!

328
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:58,715
[SPEAKER_03]: that's already on the USB and you can basically take it anywhere with you, plug it into the computer and go.

329
00:20:58,955 --> 00:21:01,498
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an innovation thing, but, I mean, Yu-Gi-Oh!

330
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:02,239
[SPEAKER_03]: is great.

331
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,464
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was quite interesting how they wanted to explain how it worked.

332
00:21:06,604 --> 00:21:08,526
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I think we get it, you know.

333
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,691
[SPEAKER_03]: How about DDR Supernova?

334
00:21:12,811 --> 00:21:13,813
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I didn't play that at all.

335
00:21:14,936 --> 00:21:19,146
[SPEAKER_04]: I was the first person in the United States outside of Konami to play the game.

336
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,781
[SPEAKER_04]: You're staking that claim right there?

337
00:21:21,801 --> 00:21:22,701
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm staking that claim.

338
00:21:23,601 --> 00:21:30,325
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe I was number four in the play on that machine, besides Jason Enos and two other Konami employees that were testing it out.

339
00:21:30,825 --> 00:21:33,126
[SPEAKER_04]: I was on that game almost all day.

340
00:21:33,886 --> 00:21:34,807
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great.

341
00:21:34,887 --> 00:21:35,307
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.

342
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:42,070
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really out of shape, though, and my only complaint is Fascination Max.

343
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,771
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a dumb-sounding song.

344
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,153
[SPEAKER_04]: The bonus stage.

345
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:52,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the bonus stage to the boss song or whatever, it sounds like a really crappy fan mix and the steps, it reminds me of a really bad sim file.

346
00:21:53,052 --> 00:22:21,044
[SPEAKER_04]: that's it's really sad that that's you know because they could do so much better and I remember like you know Paranoia Respect that was a cool remix of Paranoia and it sounded cool and was hard but it's starting to get to the point now with Max you know you have Max period which was just bullshit as it was as a song and a remix and now this is just a step beyond that and it I don't know might some people like it because it's super hard I personally didn't care for it but you know what there's 350

347
00:22:22,106 --> 00:22:23,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Some songs in this thing.

348
00:22:23,587 --> 00:22:24,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares?

349
00:22:24,767 --> 00:22:26,188
[SPEAKER_03]: One song is not going to ruin it.

350
00:22:26,328 --> 00:22:26,728
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

351
00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:28,549
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a real good time playing it, too.

352
00:22:28,569 --> 00:22:39,234
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of repeats for me, but I understand that DDR, this is an early build, and I think a lot of folks on DDR Freak and stuff are running with this.

353
00:22:39,394 --> 00:22:43,696
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's still much more news to come on DDR Supernova.

354
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:45,517
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just happy it's coming back to the arcades.

355
00:22:45,537 --> 00:22:45,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

356
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:49,159
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to understand that the build that we played on was 50% done.

357
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:52,802
[SPEAKER_04]: It had 230 songs on it right now, most of which were repeats.

358
00:22:52,862 --> 00:22:53,522
[SPEAKER_04]: But who cares?

359
00:22:54,283 --> 00:22:55,664
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just the old stuff.

360
00:22:55,804 --> 00:22:58,666
[SPEAKER_04]: That means 70 new songs that are going to be in there.

361
00:22:59,186 --> 00:23:02,728
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very curious to check out Battle Mode because that's something I've been bitching about.

362
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:07,191
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs to be in an arcade DDR that's not Disney Mix for a long, long time.

363
00:23:07,231 --> 00:23:09,253
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm really excited to see the Battle Mode.

364
00:23:09,273 --> 00:23:14,016
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see what this is all about because I think DDR could be marketed as a very competitive game.

365
00:23:14,036 --> 00:23:15,317
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looks like it's kind of going that way

366
00:23:15,897 --> 00:23:16,958
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing the tournaments.

367
00:23:18,058 --> 00:23:19,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Worldwide tournament mode.

368
00:23:19,339 --> 00:23:24,081
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be released in all three regions, US, UK, and Japan.

369
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,743
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going to be great also, the interface is really strange.

370
00:23:27,803 --> 00:23:29,524
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no more backgrounds to songs.

371
00:23:29,684 --> 00:23:31,925
[SPEAKER_04]: I've noticed no more background pictures.

372
00:23:31,985 --> 00:23:33,506
[SPEAKER_03]: I completely missed that.

373
00:23:33,626 --> 00:23:37,908
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all just normal video unless it actually has a video.

374
00:23:37,948 --> 00:23:40,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, it's got the 3D stage with the dancers and stuff.

375
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:42,551
[SPEAKER_03]: That could be something that's still being worked on too.

376
00:23:42,591 --> 00:23:42,931
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know.

377
00:23:43,411 --> 00:23:44,492
[SPEAKER_04]: subsistence subsistence subsistence

378
00:24:12,671 --> 00:24:13,512
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking of something else.

379
00:24:34,591 --> 00:24:39,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you hear, though, that Naoki and Taka actually went down from Gamers Day to the location test?

380
00:24:39,692 --> 00:24:40,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I saw that.

381
00:24:40,392 --> 00:24:41,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, very interesting.

382
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:43,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was kind of funny, the whole story with Naoki.

383
00:24:44,133 --> 00:24:47,233
[SPEAKER_04]: He was there taking pictures of the machine and people playing and stuff.

384
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,394
[SPEAKER_04]: He was kind of running around like a little girl.

385
00:24:49,414 --> 00:24:50,174
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of funny.

386
00:24:51,394 --> 00:24:54,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Just watching them so excited about everything.

387
00:24:55,315 --> 00:24:55,815
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great.

388
00:24:57,775 --> 00:25:00,576
[SPEAKER_04]: We got some cool gifts and stuff.

389
00:25:01,796 --> 00:25:02,116
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

390
00:25:02,644 --> 00:25:05,950
[SPEAKER_04]: New songs, interesting to say the least.

391
00:25:06,411 --> 00:25:07,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Not too impressed with some of them.

392
00:25:09,277 --> 00:25:12,744
[SPEAKER_04]: I could care for a little bit less toxic being in...

393
00:25:15,658 --> 00:25:17,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that reminds me, Toxic in Beatmania.

394
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:25,822
[SPEAKER_04]: I like what they did with the videos in the background, because it kind of reminded me of new videos for the songs, which are pretty cool.

395
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:28,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you notice, though, in some of the videos, they didn't bother changing them?

396
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:32,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, colors, it still says 2DX6 style in the corner in the video.

397
00:25:32,484 --> 00:25:33,305
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't bother taking that out.

398
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:33,845
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll probably change.

399
00:25:34,285 --> 00:25:36,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know, because it looked like a finished build to me.

400
00:25:36,127 --> 00:25:42,073
[SPEAKER_03]: And I noticed this when Taka was playing against the Konami employee, Ferrari, when they were battling each other.

401
00:25:42,093 --> 00:25:43,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Ferrari won, by the way, and Taka failed the song.

402
00:25:43,934 --> 00:25:47,858
[SPEAKER_03]: They were playing colors, and they had a little Six Style logo in the corner.

403
00:25:47,898 --> 00:25:50,060
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed that, and it looked like a final build of the game to me.

404
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,883
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this thing's coming out pretty soon, so I think they just didn't bother changing it.

405
00:25:52,943 --> 00:25:54,064
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, who cares?

406
00:25:54,144 --> 00:25:56,226
[SPEAKER_03]: It hasn't gotten gold yet, though, so I think it's fine.

407
00:25:56,386 --> 00:25:56,947
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see, we'll see.

408
00:25:57,447 --> 00:26:01,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you want to say about Konami Gamers Day?

409
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,391
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really glad to have gone.

410
00:26:02,992 --> 00:26:05,734
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish they had shown more stuff that's coming out.

411
00:26:06,272 --> 00:26:06,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Namco Namco

412
00:26:34,947 --> 00:26:35,548
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, anyway.

413
00:26:36,649 --> 00:26:45,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, speaking of Jamie, Jamie, since she unfortunately was not able to go to Gamers Day, she was at school and at work, and she was also...

414
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:46,701
[SPEAKER_08]: I was painting.

415
00:26:47,081 --> 00:26:48,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Painting and reading your letters.

416
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:52,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I was also reading letters while I was supposed to be at school.

417
00:26:52,382 --> 00:26:59,883
[SPEAKER_03]: So, when you guys send in your emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, DarkSakura reads them and throws them away.

418
00:27:00,003 --> 00:27:00,804
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I laugh at them.

419
00:27:01,004 --> 00:27:01,604
[SPEAKER_03]: No, just kidding.

420
00:27:02,044 --> 00:27:06,905
[SPEAKER_03]: She brings them Sunday nights to the show with her to read them live on air, at least some select pieces.

421
00:27:06,965 --> 00:27:10,905
[SPEAKER_03]: So DarkSakura, reach into that mailbag and tell us who wrote us this week.

422
00:27:11,745 --> 00:27:15,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, just to go ahead and make a quick statement, I am going to be...

423
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:23,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Limiting some of my letters to maybe about the top, I'd say, six letters that I receive.

424
00:27:24,203 --> 00:27:27,185
[SPEAKER_08]: So these are tonight's grouping.

425
00:27:27,965 --> 00:27:28,866
[SPEAKER_08]: These are the lucky few.

426
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:35,229
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to start off with a letter from Simmel, who's one of our UK listeners.

427
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:40,872
[SPEAKER_08]: Says, to let you know, in the UK we have Go Sudoku for PSP.

428
00:27:41,252 --> 00:27:42,993
[SPEAKER_08]: It's multiplayer and downloadable puzzles.

429
00:27:43,033 --> 00:27:43,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Best of all, it's only 20 pounds.

430
00:27:45,162 --> 00:27:49,123
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, we were talking about Sudoku last week, so I guess they already have a version of it over there in the UK.

431
00:27:49,363 --> 00:27:51,744
[SPEAKER_03]: They probably have a cheap one here, I just don't know of it.

432
00:27:51,764 --> 00:27:56,325
[SPEAKER_08]: On average, though, PSP games in the UK are anywhere between 35 to 40 pounds.

433
00:27:56,985 --> 00:27:58,865
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's actually a really good price.

434
00:27:59,926 --> 00:28:02,166
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder how that compares to how much those books cost.

435
00:28:02,866 --> 00:28:04,587
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd rather have a PSP game before I have a book.

436
00:28:04,607 --> 00:28:07,307
[SPEAKER_08]: It'd be about like us buying a PSP game for 35 bucks.

437
00:28:07,507 --> 00:28:13,509
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't see myself buying Sudoku on any system when a god like Tetris is right around the corner for DS, you know?

438
00:28:13,689 --> 00:28:14,089
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just me.

439
00:28:14,389 --> 00:28:18,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'd also like to say that he enjoys listening to the new format and likes how the show's progressing.

440
00:28:18,954 --> 00:28:19,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

441
00:28:19,214 --> 00:28:19,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you.

442
00:28:21,556 --> 00:28:28,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Another letter comes from DJ Ratchet, who's one of our newer people on the forums, too.

443
00:28:29,945 --> 00:28:31,887
[SPEAKER_08]: He wants to say that he loves the podcast.

444
00:28:32,107 --> 00:28:32,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

445
00:28:33,028 --> 00:28:38,093
[SPEAKER_08]: And has questions about Kingdom Hearts 2, estimated release date in the U.S., and if there's really a Tron level.

446
00:28:39,187 --> 00:28:40,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, there's a Tron level.

447
00:28:41,008 --> 00:28:43,690
[SPEAKER_08]: I do have a friend who owns the Japanese release.

448
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:47,312
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm supposed to be obtaining it shortly myself.

449
00:28:49,613 --> 00:28:52,995
[SPEAKER_08]: And from what I understand, you know, I actually did have the release date.

450
00:28:53,035 --> 00:28:54,436
[SPEAKER_08]: I do believe it's the end of March.

451
00:28:55,676 --> 00:28:55,756
[SPEAKER_04]: 31st.

452
00:28:55,836 --> 00:28:57,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, it was 29th to the 31st.

453
00:28:57,477 --> 00:28:57,938
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's 31st now.

454
00:28:58,877 --> 00:28:59,057
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

455
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:02,680
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I got my date through my resource, too.

456
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's a good day lining up.

457
00:29:05,301 --> 00:29:05,822
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good sign.

458
00:29:05,842 --> 00:29:06,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, mine's pre-ordered.

459
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:07,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Mine's pre-ordered already.

460
00:29:07,743 --> 00:29:14,568
[SPEAKER_08]: But not only is there a Tron level, there's also a Steamboat Willie level, which is so adorable.

461
00:29:14,708 --> 00:29:24,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I think that they're getting into the whole music game thing because the entire Undersea level is like big old Horkin music game.

462
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:26,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting, alright.

463
00:29:26,626 --> 00:29:27,707
[SPEAKER_08]: A whole new world?

464
00:29:43,954 --> 00:29:45,496
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's in Aladdin.

465
00:29:46,136 --> 00:29:47,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't ask me, okay?

466
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:50,200
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's just hilarious.

467
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of their world?

468
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:52,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of your world.

469
00:29:52,121 --> 00:29:52,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that it?

470
00:29:52,862 --> 00:29:54,003
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I'm close.

471
00:29:54,383 --> 00:29:57,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Every Disney song has something about, I want to be accepted by the world.

472
00:29:57,867 --> 00:29:59,768
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an outcast and I want to be loved.

473
00:30:00,769 --> 00:30:02,110
[SPEAKER_08]: I suck emo.

474
00:30:02,491 --> 00:30:04,212
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to be accepted by Blizzard.

475
00:30:04,252 --> 00:30:05,934
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to be loved in World of Warcraft.

476
00:30:06,134 --> 00:30:08,036
[SPEAKER_08]: For the record, there is a sixth emo ranger now.

477
00:30:08,499 --> 00:30:11,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Jack Thompson Let's Have Tea has emailed us

478
00:30:25,967 --> 00:30:27,068
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that nickname.

479
00:30:27,108 --> 00:30:27,548
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.

480
00:30:27,668 --> 00:30:31,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Our listeners and emailers have the best nicknames in the world.

481
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:34,496
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we had Pooface made a comment in the first hour of the show.

482
00:30:34,836 --> 00:30:35,797
[SPEAKER_03]: We had Let's Have Tea.

483
00:30:35,997 --> 00:30:36,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Pooface is awesome.

484
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:37,359
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

485
00:30:37,979 --> 00:30:39,922
[SPEAKER_08]: But every time I see Xander, I think of Buffy.

486
00:30:40,923 --> 00:30:42,004
[SPEAKER_03]: I think of Drawn Together.

487
00:30:43,612 --> 00:30:45,493
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on a never ending quest to save my girlfriend

488
00:31:05,723 --> 00:31:06,624
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a light in my dark soul

489
00:31:33,578 --> 00:31:36,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, you had me on musicals, so forget it.

490
00:31:36,444 --> 00:31:36,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

491
00:31:37,005 --> 00:31:44,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Pendragon writes in and says, this is support for Loki's whole PC fetish.

492
00:31:45,106 --> 00:31:46,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we have a Loki supporter!

493
00:31:47,787 --> 00:31:48,988
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to admit, it's about time.

494
00:31:49,528 --> 00:31:53,210
[SPEAKER_03]: We've heard the anti end of it, so now we need to hear the pro end of it.

495
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:53,630
[SPEAKER_03]: We're fair.

496
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:55,931
[SPEAKER_03]: We're fair and balanced radio.

497
00:31:56,472 --> 00:31:58,853
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not what it looks like, but how it actually works and performs.

498
00:31:58,893 --> 00:32:00,153
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see about the new Intel Macs.

499
00:32:00,193 --> 00:32:05,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, this pretty interface will bug the system down and overall will not be as fast as the PC.

500
00:32:05,336 --> 00:32:07,277
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a 3D graphic artist and I wouldn't bother with the Mac.

501
00:32:07,737 --> 00:32:08,598
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to know what?

502
00:32:08,998 --> 00:32:16,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, you're obviously not a professional graphic artist because just about any professional will use a Mac.

503
00:32:16,683 --> 00:32:22,708
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Intel Macs are clocked to be much faster than their equivalent PC.

504
00:32:25,025 --> 00:32:25,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is why I'm getting one.

505
00:32:27,206 --> 00:32:29,347
[SPEAKER_03]: This PC Mac thing is so 2005.

506
00:32:29,988 --> 00:32:30,948
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm done.

507
00:32:31,068 --> 00:32:31,389
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm done.

508
00:32:31,789 --> 00:32:33,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop sending emails on it.

509
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:34,130
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

510
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:41,795
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't wait until I get started broadcasting from my Mac because now the new iLife 6 has instant podcast support.

511
00:32:42,035 --> 00:32:43,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Will you be broadcasting in flavors?

512
00:32:44,637 --> 00:32:45,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I will have.

513
00:32:45,437 --> 00:32:47,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop egging this whole thing off.

514
00:32:47,979 --> 00:32:49,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Just sit down and shut up.

515
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,121
[SPEAKER_08]: My show tastes like purple.

516
00:32:51,912 --> 00:32:52,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on.

517
00:32:52,633 --> 00:32:53,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Next email.

518
00:32:53,433 --> 00:32:56,416
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to do a podcast in a black like my soul flavor.

519
00:32:57,617 --> 00:32:58,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

520
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:04,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Raphael writes in and says, I'm going to try not to rant about this, but here we go.

521
00:33:04,522 --> 00:33:06,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Usually that means there's a rant following.

522
00:33:07,064 --> 00:33:12,028
[SPEAKER_08]: The one thing that I find very amusing is that religious people say how bad and evil video games are.

523
00:33:12,129 --> 00:33:17,133
[SPEAKER_08]: However, they had even taken the smallest amount of time to read summaries of the game.

524
00:33:17,153 --> 00:33:18,414
[SPEAKER_08]: They would realize that the most...

525
00:33:19,554 --> 00:33:23,978
[SPEAKER_08]: games promote some of their morals, such as friendship, love, peace, tolerance, etc.

526
00:33:25,078 --> 00:33:31,263
[SPEAKER_08]: It just proves that most of the religious people in the media have blind, ignorant hate, which true Christians would frown upon.

527
00:33:31,784 --> 00:33:38,009
[SPEAKER_08]: However, I would like to note that not all Christians are like this, and not all video games deserve to be defended, such as games with blood, gore, dot dot dot.

528
00:33:39,029 --> 00:33:44,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Though this is only my personal view, as I would rather play Animal Crossing than shoot someone and laugh as their stomach explode.

529
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:54,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, again, I have a problem, and I'm sure the emailer didn't intend to do this, but I have a problem with the generalization of religious people, because you can be religious and not be a moron.

530
00:33:55,145 --> 00:33:56,146
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easily possible.

531
00:33:56,166 --> 00:33:57,186
[SPEAKER_03]: I have many... I know.

532
00:33:57,206 --> 00:33:57,707
[SPEAKER_03]: You just said that.

533
00:33:57,807 --> 00:34:02,069
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, but I just wanted to clarify as well, but, you know.

534
00:34:05,432 --> 00:34:05,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, moving on.

535
00:34:06,172 --> 00:34:06,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on.

536
00:34:07,273 --> 00:34:09,174
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, I was taking a moment to savor my caffeine.

537
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:10,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I do appreciate the perspective, though.

538
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:10,980
[SPEAKER_03]: He's right.

539
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,285
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because it makes me think of something, and this has nothing to do with games but TV, so DarkSakura, just tune out for a minute.

540
00:34:17,146 --> 00:34:29,376
[SPEAKER_03]: There was this show on TV recently called Book of Daniel on NBC, and it got this huge flack from, you know, just the bad apples of the religious world that said, you know, it's sacrilegious, da-da-da.

541
00:34:29,897 --> 00:34:34,120
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you actually took time to watch the show, you'd see that it actually portrayed the...

542
00:34:37,543 --> 00:34:38,824
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

543
00:35:07,515 --> 00:35:11,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Just goes to show it's the blind leading the, you know, brainless and blind.

544
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:17,764
[SPEAKER_08]: I got an email from one of our listeners, SithSpawn.

545
00:35:20,407 --> 00:35:21,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, three bits to bring up.

546
00:35:21,988 --> 00:35:26,072
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go ahead and I'll paraphrase this a little bit, but I'll go ahead and read some of it.

547
00:35:26,712 --> 00:35:31,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting bit number one, you can now listen to OLR and the other podcasts if you have a TiVo and broadband connection.

548
00:35:32,412 --> 00:35:34,033
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard about TiVo Podcast.

549
00:35:34,053 --> 00:35:35,033
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so awesome.

550
00:35:35,053 --> 00:35:37,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to see our show on TiVo.

551
00:35:37,755 --> 00:35:39,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a picture of your TV and send it.

552
00:35:39,656 --> 00:35:48,240
[SPEAKER_08]: The article is located at publications.mediapost.com The URL is really long, so I'll just say look for it there.

553
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,861
[SPEAKER_08]: He set OLR up and works great.

554
00:35:51,901 --> 00:35:54,343
[SPEAKER_08]: He even displays our logo on the TV.

555
00:35:55,343 --> 00:35:55,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet.

556
00:35:55,763 --> 00:35:56,263
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

557
00:35:57,004 --> 00:35:57,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Send us a picture.

558
00:35:57,524 --> 00:35:57,984
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see that.

559
00:35:58,044 --> 00:35:59,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I would really like to see a picture of that.

560
00:36:00,131 --> 00:36:01,997
[SPEAKER_03]: I have TiVo knockoff on my TV.

561
00:36:02,017 --> 00:36:03,522
[SPEAKER_03]: I have Comcast, not TiVo.

562
00:36:05,026 --> 00:36:12,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting bit number two, not sure if you mentioned this yet, recently PC Gamer announced that they will no longer use advertisements for items and gold farming services.

563
00:36:13,869 --> 00:36:17,731
[SPEAKER_08]: The article is at www.next-gen.biz.

564
00:36:19,251 --> 00:36:23,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Gamers that play MMOs just want to know what we think about that.

565
00:36:23,553 --> 00:36:33,577
[SPEAKER_08]: He says his opinion is that this is a great idea, not so much because it will put farmers out of business, but because it's a big statement that gamers are getting really sick of these game-ruining services.

566
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:39,402
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard about it, and I think we were considering it for inclusion in previous podcasts, but we were out of time.

567
00:36:39,922 --> 00:36:47,345
[SPEAKER_03]: And I support the move, you know, and I don't know.

568
00:36:47,365 --> 00:36:48,366
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's all I really have to say.

569
00:36:49,659 --> 00:36:56,420
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also, um, the last thing is that last week I got an email from Sony asking me to participate in a PSP beta for Siphon Filter Dark Mirror.

570
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, go to a site, fill out a form, and they mail you a UMD.

571
00:36:59,861 --> 00:37:00,281
[SPEAKER_08]: The catch?

572
00:37:00,321 --> 00:37:03,262
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to sign up using the PSP browser and you need the newest firmware, 2.6.

573
00:37:03,742 --> 00:37:10,223
[SPEAKER_08]: I hit up the site about 10 hours after I got the email and quickly got a message saying they already had all the beta participants they needed.

574
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:14,024
[SPEAKER_08]: The beta is full less than a day after the email, WTF.

575
00:37:14,244 --> 00:37:16,104
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple things to touch on that.

576
00:37:16,364 --> 00:37:18,085
[SPEAKER_04]: One, you didn't need the 2.6 firmware.

577
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:19,625
[SPEAKER_04]: You could spoof it and it's no problem.

578
00:37:19,945 --> 00:37:24,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Two, it's not going to really matter anymore, which we'll cover later.

579
00:37:24,946 --> 00:37:25,247
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

580
00:37:25,787 --> 00:37:33,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, what he thinks about that is it was a very limited beta, knowing that thousands of gamers would try to update their PSP to 2.6 to sign up.

581
00:37:33,308 --> 00:37:35,429
[SPEAKER_02]: For a siphon filter game?

582
00:37:36,604 --> 00:37:37,245
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot.

583
00:37:37,265 --> 00:37:47,839
[SPEAKER_04]: There was also another beta that's going on right now actually for Pursuit Force, which is going out to also people that are members of the PlayStation.com.

584
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, they select...

585
00:37:50,157 --> 00:37:51,378
[SPEAKER_04]: A few of them that participate.

586
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other emails?

587
00:37:56,122 --> 00:37:58,624
[SPEAKER_08]: There is actually one more just because it needs to be said.

588
00:37:58,904 --> 00:38:12,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, I do want to go in and thank Rob Way for the article about the game writing from the first half of the show because he's the one who gave me that little bit of knowledge.

589
00:38:15,939 --> 00:38:24,008
[SPEAKER_08]: One of our writers, John Blanco, said that he didn't get bored of Nintendogs, just recently acquired 50,000 trainer points.

590
00:38:24,609 --> 00:38:27,613
[SPEAKER_08]: All dogs and interior decorations are now unlocked.

591
00:38:28,093 --> 00:38:29,074
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a quote.

592
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, go on with your bad self.

593
00:38:35,102 --> 00:38:35,722
[SPEAKER_08]: You rock.

594
00:38:35,842 --> 00:38:36,803
[SPEAKER_02]: And your bad game.

595
00:38:37,644 --> 00:38:40,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I liked the puppies, okay?

596
00:38:40,126 --> 00:38:41,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Weren't you not here, Miklatov?

597
00:38:41,788 --> 00:38:42,669
[SPEAKER_03]: When did you come back?

598
00:38:42,769 --> 00:38:43,910
[SPEAKER_03]: You just appeared suddenly.

599
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I appeared suddenly with Starbucks.

600
00:38:45,771 --> 00:38:46,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, that's right.

601
00:38:46,572 --> 00:38:47,673
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how the coffee got my hand.

602
00:38:47,973 --> 00:38:49,014
[SPEAKER_08]: He appeared with crack.

603
00:38:49,154 --> 00:38:49,615
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

604
00:38:49,875 --> 00:38:50,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

605
00:38:50,776 --> 00:38:51,757
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm almost out.

606
00:38:51,977 --> 00:38:53,779
[SPEAKER_08]: We remember what Thomi has to say about this.

607
00:38:54,279 --> 00:38:58,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Taco is into the to-be-sold pile for GameStop right now.

608
00:39:00,266 --> 00:39:06,289
[SPEAKER_08]: So is Ayn Menchie and my Dalmatian, who I forgot what I named.

609
00:39:07,389 --> 00:39:07,810
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

610
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:08,970
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's it for the emails?

611
00:39:10,111 --> 00:39:10,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

612
00:39:10,531 --> 00:39:19,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Send your emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and we definitely read them all, try to respond to them all, and read as many as we can in any given week.

613
00:39:19,396 --> 00:39:20,336
[SPEAKER_03]: So we love getting emails.

614
00:39:20,356 --> 00:39:21,097
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got a ton.

615
00:39:21,197 --> 00:39:23,078
[SPEAKER_03]: It inflates our egos and makes us feel loved.

616
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:24,839
[SPEAKER_08]: I will take the top six.

617
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:26,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Metal Gear Solid

618
00:39:50,545 --> 00:39:51,546
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's always good.

619
00:39:52,006 --> 00:39:54,007
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, look, I'm super busy right now.

620
00:39:54,388 --> 00:39:58,731
[SPEAKER_04]: I can only do three movies in two years.

621
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:03,113
[SPEAKER_04]: So early I said I could do Hitman or Metal Gear Solid B Fall of 2007.

622
00:40:04,054 --> 00:40:06,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that they would give you the rights to it anyways, you jackass.

623
00:40:06,956 --> 00:40:18,984
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, he's not doing it, and his next piece of crap that's coming out is in the name of the king, Dungeon Seas movie, better known as We Ripped Off, Lord of the Rings for the entire thing, and it sucks.

624
00:40:19,738 --> 00:40:21,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Look for that coming in November.

625
00:40:22,241 --> 00:40:23,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, in two parts, by the way.

626
00:40:25,244 --> 00:40:28,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and what's he made on BloodRayne so far?

627
00:40:28,868 --> 00:40:30,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Not jack shit.

628
00:40:30,129 --> 00:40:30,810
[SPEAKER_03]: $20, maybe?

629
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:33,833
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, hopefully these studios will learn.

630
00:40:35,728 --> 00:40:36,449
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR West Virginia

631
00:41:00,532 --> 00:41:02,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knew that West Virginia still made the news once in a while?

632
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:03,656
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm teasing, I'm teasing.

633
00:41:04,216 --> 00:41:14,729
[SPEAKER_03]: West Virginia actually, they had a partnership with Konami to put Dance Dance Revolution in 753 public schools.

634
00:41:14,769 --> 00:41:17,472
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be all of them within the next three years.

635
00:41:17,632 --> 00:41:19,755
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a pilot project that started last spring.

636
00:41:20,163 --> 00:41:22,444
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're actually going to incorporate it into schools.

637
00:41:22,905 --> 00:41:23,925
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's kind of interesting.

638
00:41:24,946 --> 00:41:29,848
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's being helped, funded by Konami, as well as all the usual grants and stuff.

639
00:41:29,928 --> 00:41:31,209
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're playing Ultra Mix.

640
00:41:31,549 --> 00:41:33,050
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know which one, but I know they're doing Ultra Mix.

641
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:38,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, in the little clip here, you can see on Yahoo News where I pulled it from.

642
00:41:38,453 --> 00:41:40,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, this particular one, they're playing Extreme.

643
00:41:40,614 --> 00:41:44,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's a lie when they actually play it, because it's Ultra Mix.

644
00:41:45,877 --> 00:41:46,218
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

645
00:41:46,858 --> 00:41:47,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

646
00:41:47,659 --> 00:41:48,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are they doing this here?

647
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:59,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Health Promotions Manager Nydia Henderson, Manager for the Public Employees Insurance Program, says, One out of three children born in West Virginia today will have diabetes by the time they grow up.

648
00:41:59,569 --> 00:42:02,552
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a devastating statistic and not acceptable.

649
00:42:02,632 --> 00:42:07,657
[SPEAKER_03]: So essentially they're trying to make fitness fun and get kids into it via DDR, which I think is pretty awesome.

650
00:42:08,457 --> 00:42:11,240
[SPEAKER_03]: And to make people not afraid of West Virginia.

651
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:11,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

652
00:42:12,014 --> 00:42:16,277
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember what I said earlier about obesity being basically pandemic.

653
00:42:17,518 --> 00:42:19,899
[SPEAKER_08]: I applaud their efforts in trying to get kids active.

654
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,983
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to be a little bit of a fly on the wall at Konami's Gamer Day, and I picked up a little interesting tidbit.

655
00:42:25,063 --> 00:42:28,045
[SPEAKER_03]: All I can say is, this won't be the last of it that you hear.

656
00:42:28,265 --> 00:42:28,985
[SPEAKER_03]: This won't be the last of it.

657
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:34,869
[SPEAKER_08]: You know a lot of independent schools in California are doing the same, just on their own, just buying the machine and making it part of their gym program.

658
00:42:35,189 --> 00:42:37,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Why can't I know this stuff and I work for Konami?

659
00:42:37,411 --> 00:42:37,491
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

660
00:42:38,629 --> 00:42:39,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

661
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:53,604
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the important part.

662
00:43:14,286 --> 00:43:14,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Chuu!

663
00:43:14,426 --> 00:43:14,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Chuu!

664
00:43:14,626 --> 00:43:14,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Chuu!

665
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:43,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so it includes, you know, they have different things.

666
00:43:43,244 --> 00:43:55,214
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also kind of got a little bit of Ode to Jam type of feel to it where you can, you know, soup up your avatars with different items that you win by earning credits and stuff and learn new moves, songs, etc.

667
00:43:55,974 --> 00:43:59,077
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to check this out, they're actually doing a free beta on it right now.

668
00:43:59,377 --> 00:44:03,160
[SPEAKER_03]: It's au.bugsgames.net.

669
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,583
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say that was headlined on our site earlier this week, so it should have a link there too.

670
00:44:07,523 --> 00:44:08,326
[SPEAKER_03]: OrangeLandsRadio.com.

671
00:44:08,787 --> 00:44:09,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Much easier to remember.

672
00:44:11,095 --> 00:44:11,495
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

673
00:44:12,635 --> 00:44:15,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, audition something that can be played worldwide, yes?

674
00:44:15,436 --> 00:44:15,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

675
00:44:15,796 --> 00:44:18,317
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would include our friends in the UK.

676
00:44:18,397 --> 00:44:25,519
[SPEAKER_04]: However, you do want to have Internet Explorer for signing up on the site and everything because it only works in Internet Explorer.

677
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:26,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Worst game ever.

678
00:44:26,819 --> 00:44:28,059
[SPEAKER_04]: No love for Firefox.

679
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:28,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Worst game ever.

680
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:29,800
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

681
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:33,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I was trying to do a segue into the UK news that you completely interrupted.

682
00:44:33,221 --> 00:44:33,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

683
00:44:34,021 --> 00:44:36,122
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, my segue is ruined.

684
00:44:36,222 --> 00:44:36,602
[SPEAKER_03]: UK news.

685
00:44:36,822 --> 00:44:37,402
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up in the UK?

686
00:44:38,004 --> 00:44:38,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of stuff.

687
00:44:39,686 --> 00:44:48,374
[SPEAKER_08]: First off, there is a Crash Day demo from Atari put out for PC, PS2, and Xbox.

688
00:44:49,475 --> 00:44:53,058
[SPEAKER_08]: And the download is actually up on Eurogamer.

689
00:44:53,439 --> 00:44:56,061
[SPEAKER_08]: If you go to their homepage, there's a link to the demo.

690
00:44:56,802 --> 00:44:57,583
[SPEAKER_08]: I love Eurogamer.

691
00:44:59,609 --> 00:45:09,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, the game is a combination of racing, stunts, and big ol' weapons, so you can make big smashy messes and design your own tracks.

692
00:45:09,879 --> 00:45:16,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Demo includes a wrecking match event and a stunt show event, and you can even try out the multiplayer mode via either LAN or internet.

693
00:45:17,025 --> 00:45:20,729
[SPEAKER_08]: You can only launch the demo 50 times, though, so be warned.

694
00:45:21,069 --> 00:45:22,530
[SPEAKER_08]: The official release date is February 24th.

695
00:45:25,268 --> 00:45:30,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, for our listeners in Australia, we never forget you guys.

696
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:33,371
[SPEAKER_08]: The Xbox 360 has been delayed.

697
00:45:33,651 --> 00:45:35,932
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some in chat right now, too.

698
00:45:36,352 --> 00:45:38,352
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got to be a crazy hour over there right now.

699
00:45:38,372 --> 00:45:40,093
[SPEAKER_08]: It's something in the morning, isn't it?

700
00:45:40,153 --> 00:45:42,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks to you early birds in Australia tuning in.

701
00:45:43,034 --> 00:45:43,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Love ya!

702
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:45,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for hanging out with us.

703
00:45:48,077 --> 00:45:51,839
[SPEAKER_08]: The console was supposed to launch on March 2nd.

704
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,841
[SPEAKER_08]: The date has been delayed to March 23rd.

705
00:45:55,422 --> 00:46:07,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Microsoft said that the slip-up was due to, and I quote, unprecedented global consumer demand and short-term manufacturing issues due to component shortages stemming from challenges in rampant supplies, meaning we screwed up.

706
00:46:09,362 --> 00:46:16,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, according to Microsoft, the launch date ensures that the markets will have an adequate supply of Xbox 360 consoles to meet demand at launch.

707
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:19,610
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe they're trying to learn from their little mess up with us.

708
00:46:20,815 --> 00:46:25,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to clarify, Deekman, who's our friend down under in chat right now, says it's actually only 3 p.m.

709
00:46:25,496 --> 00:46:25,776
[SPEAKER_03]: over there.

710
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:26,996
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's not too bad.

711
00:46:27,016 --> 00:46:28,577
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not bad.

712
00:46:29,577 --> 00:46:35,298
[SPEAKER_08]: They also, though, expect to sell between 4.5 million and 5.5 million units by July.

713
00:46:37,099 --> 00:46:43,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, there was the mention, too, that demand is completely overpowering supply everywhere.

714
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Microsoft said that they've lowered their 90-day sales forecast.

715
00:46:49,867 --> 00:46:52,913
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, they got a little bit ahead of themselves, huh?

716
00:46:52,933 --> 00:46:54,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Does everywhere not include Japan anymore?

717
00:46:55,538 --> 00:46:56,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Japan, they've only sold 100,000.

718
00:46:58,263 --> 00:46:59,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's not surprising.

719
00:47:00,104 --> 00:47:05,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, you know, I'm sure people who know me know I have a lot of love for SNK.

720
00:47:06,186 --> 00:47:07,626
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a Neo Geo.

721
00:47:07,766 --> 00:47:10,387
[SPEAKER_08]: I have versions of King of Fighters 2000.

722
00:47:10,427 --> 00:47:12,648
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that you bought a Neo Geo is hardcore right there.

723
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:15,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, my husband traded a Sega CD for it.

724
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:18,390
[SPEAKER_08]: And now we have another Sega CD.

725
00:47:19,991 --> 00:47:21,291
[SPEAKER_08]: But this was a while back.

726
00:47:23,432 --> 00:47:23,512
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

727
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:35,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Xbox is getting KOF Neowave, which is basically the same three-on-three fighting team.

728
00:47:35,728 --> 00:47:38,531
[SPEAKER_08]: You have 12 three-person teams.

729
00:47:39,211 --> 00:47:41,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Included are the women's teams with Mai, King, and Yuri.

730
00:47:42,995 --> 00:47:45,076
[SPEAKER_08]: The Fatal Fury team with Terry, Joe, and Andy.

731
00:47:45,297 --> 00:47:46,337
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got a tournament mode.

732
00:47:46,538 --> 00:47:49,260
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also three modes of play.

733
00:47:50,121 --> 00:47:51,302
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really get what these are.

734
00:47:51,342 --> 00:47:53,483
[SPEAKER_08]: There's Super Cancel, Guard Break, and Max 2.

735
00:47:54,444 --> 00:47:54,945
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me.

736
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:59,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Plus a new heat mode that lets you power up attacks in exchange for gradual loss of health.

737
00:48:00,771 --> 00:48:03,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, there's screenshots up on Eurogamer, so you might want to check them out.

738
00:48:04,475 --> 00:48:11,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Also mention, if you are a King of Fighters fan, King of Fighters 94 Rebound came out a couple weeks ago, actually.

739
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:13,924
[SPEAKER_04]: For the Xbox as well.

740
00:48:14,665 --> 00:48:15,586
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got KOF 95 on Saturn.

741
00:48:18,664 --> 00:48:22,785
[SPEAKER_08]: If you've got a US Saturn, you have to do this thing where you put in your loading cart.

742
00:48:22,925 --> 00:48:24,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Change it out and put in the RAM cart real quick.

743
00:48:24,585 --> 00:48:28,106
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the, I think, three Saturn games that runs on a RAM cart.

744
00:48:29,387 --> 00:48:31,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Half the game is on cartridge, which doesn't help the load time any anyway.

745
00:48:32,987 --> 00:48:33,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, release dates.

746
00:48:34,628 --> 00:48:36,288
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually have two sets of release dates.

747
00:48:36,728 --> 00:48:40,449
[SPEAKER_08]: We have our UK release dates and Australian release dates.

748
00:48:41,709 --> 00:48:44,430
[SPEAKER_08]: So, let's go ahead and go through the rest of January, shall we?

[SPEAKER_08]: On Xbox 360, there is going to be the various Madden games, Need for Speed, Most Wanted, which I'm actually, that game's growing on me.

757
00:49:44,025 --> 00:49:44,526
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a good game.

758
00:49:45,106 --> 00:50:08,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Ridge Racer 6 of course now these are from what I'm seeing with these dates though I don't get why they're if the system's not being released until late March they're putting a February release date on them so PS2 um first February we've got World Series Poker Tied the Tasmanian Tiger um Sega Classic Collection on the 2nd February 6th We Love Katamari

[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else?

762
00:50:42,824 --> 00:50:44,965
[SPEAKER_08]: And I won a winning lottery ticket.

763
00:50:46,526 --> 00:50:47,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't we all?

764
00:50:47,546 --> 00:50:48,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it matter if it's from the UK?

765
00:50:48,767 --> 00:50:49,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you win if you bought a lottery?

766
00:50:50,067 --> 00:50:50,507
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess you could.

767
00:50:51,368 --> 00:50:52,048
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like a job over there.

768
00:50:52,068 --> 00:50:53,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they even have the lottery over there?

769
00:50:53,089 --> 00:50:53,349
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

770
00:50:53,629 --> 00:50:53,849
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

771
00:50:53,869 --> 00:50:54,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, moving on.

772
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:57,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go over to Loki, who has some news about the PSP.

773
00:50:58,669 --> 00:51:07,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, actually earlier I was going to cover that they had figured out how to load all homebrew for versions 2.01 and 2.5.

774
00:51:08,072 --> 00:51:15,875
[SPEAKER_04]: They were 90% done earlier today with getting 2.6 to work, and apparently while we were doing this show they already broke the news that they've

775
00:51:16,295 --> 00:51:18,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Crack, no, figured out for 2.6.

776
00:51:18,615 --> 00:51:23,116
[SPEAKER_04]: So now every version currently of the PSP can run homebrew.

777
00:51:23,977 --> 00:51:36,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Now these latest ones, everything from 2.01 up to 2.6 require Grand Theft Auto using it, the glitch or hack that was with the save files to load an e-boot loader.

778
00:51:37,059 --> 00:51:39,219
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of how everything is working right now.

779
00:51:39,399 --> 00:51:42,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Some programs are working, some aren't.

780
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:49,303
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you don't have Grand Theft Auto and aren't planning to get one, you probably should think twice about upgrading to 2.6.

781
00:51:50,463 --> 00:51:56,446
[SPEAKER_04]: However, new games that are coming out right now will require you to upgrade to 2.5 at least.

782
00:51:56,726 --> 00:51:59,307
[SPEAKER_04]: And some I hear are actually 2.6 now.

783
00:51:59,447 --> 00:52:01,268
[SPEAKER_04]: So something to think about.

784
00:52:01,648 --> 00:52:04,169
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all late-breaking as we're taping right now.

785
00:52:04,389 --> 00:52:05,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, pretty much.

786
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:08,191
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can find that stuff on PSP Updates.

787
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:11,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Deekman pointed out that the 2.6 was done, so that was kind of cool.

788
00:52:12,416 --> 00:52:12,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

789
00:52:14,326 --> 00:52:16,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on, let's go to another topic here.

790
00:52:16,828 --> 00:52:18,629
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something completely different.

791
00:52:18,649 --> 00:52:25,113
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I like to browse the various gaming websites out there, kind of seeing what's popular, and one of them I scan on a regular basis is Joystick.

792
00:52:25,514 --> 00:52:35,620
[SPEAKER_03]: That's with a Q. Joystick had a story this week about a gallery of video game endings, and it's mostly for classic 8 and 16-bit game endings.

793
00:52:36,301 --> 00:52:37,181
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually check it out.

794
00:52:37,221 --> 00:52:42,665
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Video Game Museum at vgmuseum.com, and they mention in this story a lot of endings.

795
00:52:43,065 --> 00:52:44,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Sonic the Hedgehog,

796
00:52:44,606 --> 00:52:46,428
[SPEAKER_03]: What happens if you never were able to beat Strider?

797
00:52:47,308 --> 00:52:51,671
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, games that we all remember such as Metroid and things like that.

798
00:52:51,911 --> 00:52:54,173
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought I'd kind of bring that up here in studio.

799
00:52:54,633 --> 00:52:58,656
[SPEAKER_03]: What video game endings do you remember that are so memorable that you love?

800
00:52:59,436 --> 00:52:59,957
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura?

801
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:04,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Ryu's ending on Super Street Fighter 2 with him just walking and the music playing.

802
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:06,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Street Fighter 2 had some good endings, it did.

803
00:53:07,322 --> 00:53:09,003
[SPEAKER_03]: It was cool how every character kind of had a different one.

804
00:53:09,874 --> 00:53:11,935
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember how slow it was.

805
00:53:12,175 --> 00:53:14,557
[SPEAKER_08]: You know Street Fighter Alpha 2 came out on the Super Nintendo.

806
00:53:14,977 --> 00:53:16,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Only cartridge I had played with loading time.

807
00:53:17,138 --> 00:53:17,599
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me.

808
00:53:18,539 --> 00:53:21,100
[SPEAKER_08]: And the scenery would pop up.

809
00:53:21,221 --> 00:53:21,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, characters!

810
00:53:22,101 --> 00:53:23,382
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you kind of need them to play, don't you?

811
00:53:24,202 --> 00:53:31,106
[SPEAKER_08]: But I actually got my first screenshots from my old website, DarkSakura's Mostly Evil Shrine, from the Super Nintendo website.

812
00:53:31,126 --> 00:53:32,447
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I've been to that website.

813
00:53:33,297 --> 00:53:33,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it still up?

814
00:53:34,217 --> 00:53:34,817
[SPEAKER_08]: It's gone.

815
00:53:36,038 --> 00:53:37,758
[SPEAKER_08]: GeoCities finally deleted it.

816
00:53:37,778 --> 00:53:39,738
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to have a spin-off of Orange Jones Radio.

817
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:40,699
[SPEAKER_08]: I've saved the pages.

818
00:53:40,739 --> 00:53:41,199
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

819
00:53:41,299 --> 00:53:42,599
[SPEAKER_03]: We should put it up for nostalgia value.

820
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:43,959
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll put it up.

821
00:53:44,259 --> 00:53:45,880
[SPEAKER_08]: With its background midis and all.

822
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:47,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was crappy.

823
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:49,280
[SPEAKER_08]: But I hand-coded it.

824
00:53:49,901 --> 00:53:51,181
[SPEAKER_08]: I hand-coded my sites back then.

825
00:53:51,881 --> 00:53:52,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Other great endings.

826
00:53:52,781 --> 00:53:54,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, Miklatov, anything you want to add?

827
00:53:54,802 --> 00:53:56,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Personally, I liked the ending of Final Fantasy VIII.

828
00:53:58,282 --> 00:53:58,582
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

829
00:53:59,143 --> 00:54:00,183
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people didn't like that game.

830
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:01,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was pretty good.

831
00:54:02,355 --> 00:54:04,176
[SPEAKER_08]: The ending was cool with selfie in the camera.

832
00:54:04,876 --> 00:54:05,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy IX, though.

833
00:54:06,356 --> 00:54:06,876
[SPEAKER_04]: That game sucked.

834
00:54:08,097 --> 00:54:08,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Megalov?

835
00:54:08,977 --> 00:54:09,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Silent Hill 2.

836
00:54:09,597 --> 00:54:12,398
[SPEAKER_02]: So sad and depressing.

837
00:54:12,438 --> 00:54:12,958
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved it.

838
00:54:13,778 --> 00:54:14,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Which ending?

839
00:54:14,859 --> 00:54:16,399
[SPEAKER_02]: The one I consider to be the true ending.

840
00:54:16,739 --> 00:54:17,539
[SPEAKER_02]: The dog ending, right?

841
00:54:18,059 --> 00:54:19,340
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the leave ending.

842
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:21,000
[SPEAKER_02]: The one I saw?

843
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:23,561
[SPEAKER_02]: With the letter at the end?

844
00:54:23,601 --> 00:54:23,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

845
00:54:23,881 --> 00:54:24,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

846
00:54:24,517 --> 00:54:27,558
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate myself and want to die one Strider I have actually beaten Strider

847
00:54:41,581 --> 00:54:42,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Hardcore.

848
00:54:42,281 --> 00:54:43,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Any given Mega Man game.

849
00:54:44,082 --> 00:54:44,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

850
00:54:44,762 --> 00:54:46,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially 2, I remember that.

851
00:54:47,003 --> 00:54:50,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Games I remember, especially from the 8-bit days, Super Mario Bros.

852
00:54:50,484 --> 00:54:53,445
[SPEAKER_03]: 2, the Dallas OMG It Was All a Dream thing.

853
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:55,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Who can forget that one?

854
00:54:55,426 --> 00:54:56,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, Metroid.

855
00:54:56,466 --> 00:54:57,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Classic there.

856
00:54:57,566 --> 00:55:00,187
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think my favorite, though, would be Final Fantasy 4.

857
00:55:00,247 --> 00:55:02,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy 2 on Super Nintendo in the US.

858
00:55:02,868 --> 00:55:03,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Classic.

859
00:55:03,428 --> 00:55:04,029
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.

860
00:55:04,149 --> 00:55:04,749
[SPEAKER_03]: I loved it.

861
00:55:04,769 --> 00:55:06,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone, why are you shaking your head at that?

862
00:55:06,289 --> 00:55:06,770
[SPEAKER_03]: I loved it.

863
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:09,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I just recently played it again on the Game Boy Advance.

864
00:55:10,631 --> 00:55:10,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh.

865
00:55:11,923 --> 00:55:11,983
[SPEAKER_02]: P.K.

866
00:55:12,003 --> 00:55:12,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Akira88 says Actraiser

867
00:55:29,523 --> 00:55:36,911
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100Mac, Chrono Trigger, VXChasenXV, Stop Spoiling Silent Hill 2 After you have become sufficient enough level where you do New Game+,

868
00:55:52,806 --> 00:56:07,001
[SPEAKER_08]: and you beat the game immediately upon setting on to the teleporter you get the designer ending where they each leave you a comment and one of the people you meet is Toriyama Wasn't one of the endings where the girls would rate the guys in the game?

869
00:56:08,446 --> 00:56:09,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Dark Knight, Shenmue

870
00:56:26,397 --> 00:56:27,658
[SPEAKER_03]: No, because it's a horrible game.

871
00:56:28,178 --> 00:56:30,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Pooface says Half-Life 2 because of the cliffhanger.

872
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:32,201
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's see.

873
00:56:32,481 --> 00:56:35,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody said, oh, Pooface also said Halo 2 is the worst ending.

874
00:56:36,383 --> 00:56:38,465
[SPEAKER_03]: MiniMe283 says Zelda Ocarina of Time.

875
00:56:39,345 --> 00:56:40,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that had a good ending.

876
00:56:40,646 --> 00:56:41,086
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good ending.

877
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:41,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Good stuff.

878
00:56:41,626 --> 00:56:42,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Good stuff, you guys.

879
00:56:42,787 --> 00:56:43,147
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

880
00:56:43,187 --> 00:56:44,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go ahead and move on.

881
00:56:44,388 --> 00:56:46,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, if you want to check out that website with Classic.

882
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:49,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everything in there is considered Classic, so you may not find them all.

883
00:56:50,092 --> 00:56:52,933
[SPEAKER_03]: VGMuseum.com, though, for the Classic 8 and 16-bit ones.

884
00:56:52,953 --> 00:56:53,214
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

885
00:56:53,234 --> 00:56:54,154
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot one more.

886
00:56:54,254 --> 00:56:54,414
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

887
00:56:54,715 --> 00:56:55,375
[SPEAKER_08]: The Guardian Legends.

888
00:56:56,934 --> 00:56:57,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit, yeah.

889
00:56:57,754 --> 00:56:58,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

890
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:01,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what's going on with Street Fighter?

891
00:57:01,315 --> 00:57:02,936
[SPEAKER_03]: We brought up Street Fighter in the ending stuff.

892
00:57:02,976 --> 00:57:04,476
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on with Street Fighter now?

893
00:57:04,656 --> 00:57:09,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, as you remember, Street Fighter had a collection for it.

894
00:57:09,978 --> 00:57:23,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they have the Street Fighter Alpha collection, which is going to feature all of the Street Fighter Alpha games, including Super Gem Fighter, which is going to be pretty sweet as well.

895
00:57:25,555 --> 00:57:35,238
[SPEAKER_04]: They're basically going to also have the survival mode as well as dramatic battle which allows two-on-one tag team matches.

896
00:57:36,879 --> 00:57:40,960
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe, I'm trying to remember if they added anything else in there.

897
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:45,722
[SPEAKER_04]: I think overall though it's going to be a pretty cool collection of games.

898
00:57:46,022 --> 00:57:55,145
[SPEAKER_04]: They've also got I mentioned the Capcom Classic Collection coming out to the PSP pretty soon with

899
00:57:55,576 --> 00:57:56,658
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of cool games on there.

900
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:00,504
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what you need to put on one of those anthologies?

901
00:58:00,604 --> 00:58:00,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Huh?

902
00:58:00,965 --> 00:58:01,546
[SPEAKER_08]: Cyberbots.

903
00:58:03,869 --> 00:58:04,811
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be interesting.

904
00:58:06,754 --> 00:58:08,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, what's going on with Splinter Cell, Loki?

905
00:58:10,242 --> 00:58:13,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Splinter Cell Essentials is still coming out in March.

906
00:58:14,684 --> 00:58:19,226
[SPEAKER_04]: However, Splinter Cell Double Agent is postponed to September.

907
00:58:20,326 --> 00:58:26,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Much like they did with Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, they're tweaking the game to make sure it's perfect.

908
00:58:26,989 --> 00:58:32,831
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're worried right now that the installed base of Xbox 360 owners might not be...

909
00:58:34,045 --> 00:58:34,485
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

910
00:58:51,994 --> 00:58:53,174
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

911
00:59:17,078 --> 00:59:18,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll this up, landlord.

912
00:59:18,879 --> 00:59:24,460
[SPEAKER_08]: They're custom checks that have, hello, I am a check, please cash me, LOL, Katamari, do your best.

913
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:30,862
[SPEAKER_03]: So is this just somebody took, because they have these custom check making services, so somebody just created Katamari checks?

914
00:59:31,582 --> 00:59:32,482
[SPEAKER_08]: I suppose so.

915
00:59:33,562 --> 00:59:39,184
[SPEAKER_08]: It says on there, there's a quote that says, I designed them, when you spend money, people should feel happy and also super lucky.

916
00:59:39,624 --> 00:59:42,064
[SPEAKER_08]: It is the most important thing to be contributing to the success.

917
00:59:42,344 --> 00:59:44,185
[SPEAKER_08]: For every special day, do not chase waterfalls.

918
00:59:45,876 --> 00:59:49,300
[SPEAKER_03]: PK Akira88 in our chatroom says, now I can bounce a check in style.

919
00:59:50,401 --> 00:59:51,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

920
00:59:52,383 --> 00:59:54,386
[SPEAKER_08]: You can roll up overdraft fees too.

921
00:59:54,566 --> 00:59:56,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knew that Katamari's bounced?

922
00:59:58,726 --> 01:00:01,367
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we've just got a couple more stories left for you guys.

923
01:00:01,387 --> 01:00:05,247
[SPEAKER_03]: We are going to take just a couple quick Skype line calls right after this.

924
01:00:05,527 --> 01:00:09,088
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can call us on our Skype line, www.orangelunchradio.com.

925
01:00:09,108 --> 01:00:10,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Click on Interact With Us.

926
01:00:10,789 --> 01:00:13,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you can also call us over the regular telephone line.

927
01:00:13,389 --> 01:00:16,530
[SPEAKER_03]: However, please remember, it is not an 800 number.

928
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:20,130
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're not the person that owns the phone line, you need to get somebody's permission before you call.

929
01:00:20,451 --> 01:00:20,871
[SPEAKER_03]: The number, 916-226-7000.

930
01:00:22,958 --> 01:00:25,659
[SPEAKER_03]: The Effects of Video Game Playtypes on Pain Threshold and Tolerance

931
01:00:47,921 --> 01:00:48,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

932
01:00:48,601 --> 01:00:52,003
[SPEAKER_03]: The study compared several different genres of games and their effects on pain.

933
01:00:52,283 --> 01:00:58,425
[SPEAKER_03]: They used action, puzzle, arcade, fighting sports, and boxing games, things that encourage high attention and stimulus.

934
01:00:59,366 --> 01:01:02,387
[SPEAKER_03]: The researchers also measured the emotional response to each type.

935
01:01:04,047 --> 01:01:16,351
[SPEAKER_03]: He concluded, Dr. Brian Radenbush, the director of undergraduate research, says, Physicians could possibly implement this in their office to aid in distraction during a painful procedure such as injection or dental work.

936
01:01:16,651 --> 01:01:21,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Video games could also be used in waiting rooms to distract patients from upcoming surgical procedures.

937
01:01:22,072 --> 01:01:30,404
[SPEAKER_03]: This principle, by the way, is one of the driving forces behind Child's Play, which we talked about earlier in the program, the drive to donate games to children's hospital wards.

938
01:01:31,185 --> 01:01:32,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting there.

939
01:01:33,388 --> 01:01:37,935
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm assuming that the Nintendo DS version of Under the Knife is not one of those games.

940
01:01:38,015 --> 01:01:39,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably not.

941
01:01:39,417 --> 01:01:39,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably not.

942
01:01:39,998 --> 01:01:40,519
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?

943
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:42,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this legitimate?

944
01:01:42,543 --> 01:01:46,029
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard of this video games being used in dentist's office before to distract people.

945
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:46,810
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a great idea.

946
01:01:46,850 --> 01:01:51,858
[SPEAKER_03]: My dentist has CNN and it's distracting enough, you know, to kind of keep my mind off of...

947
01:01:53,058 --> 01:01:53,838
[SPEAKER_08]: This isn't new.

948
01:01:54,439 --> 01:02:08,107
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember being about 13 years old, watching something on the news program where they were using light hypnosis to have people go into dental surgery without anesthesia.

949
01:02:09,788 --> 01:02:10,848
[SPEAKER_08]: They had like a track.

950
01:02:11,309 --> 01:02:17,212
[SPEAKER_08]: They were actually testing it out with little children, having them follow it and saying, hey, follow the rabbit with your eyes, see where it ends up.

951
01:02:17,572 --> 01:02:20,554
[SPEAKER_08]: By the time the light would hit the end of the track, their surgery should be done.

952
01:02:23,834 --> 01:02:29,276
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a few things to follow up with, a few more stories real quick.

953
01:02:29,796 --> 01:02:31,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Just mainly Xbox Live stuff right now.

954
01:02:32,216 --> 01:02:38,398
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be an update to the Xbox Live for Call of Duty 2.

955
01:02:38,438 --> 01:02:42,499
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to have a multiplayer update that's going to be happening, I think, Monday or Tuesday.

956
01:02:43,183 --> 01:02:50,587
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, there's going to be an update for the dashboard, which was going to add that feature for webcams and whatnot.

957
01:02:50,987 --> 01:02:52,908
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's going to be coming pretty soon here.

958
01:02:53,108 --> 01:02:57,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, last week, there was a couple things added to the Xbox Live Arcade.

959
01:02:57,851 --> 01:02:59,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Marble Blast Ultra, a brand new game coming out.

960
01:02:59,972 --> 01:03:01,813
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like your Marble Madness type of game.

961
01:03:02,433 --> 01:03:08,157
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, the demo for Full Auto hit last week.

962
01:03:08,237 --> 01:03:12,139
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you don't have that yet, you need to download it, because it's awesome.

963
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:16,943
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's go over to the Skype line, see what you guys want to add tonight.

964
01:03:17,443 --> 01:03:26,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, remember, www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on Interact With Us, and you can get all the details on how to call us via the Skype line, such as this person's doing right now.

965
01:03:26,350 --> 01:03:27,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

966
01:03:28,212 --> 01:03:29,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, what's up?

967
01:03:29,553 --> 01:03:30,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, who's this?

968
01:03:30,113 --> 01:03:31,755
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Xander from Florida.

969
01:03:31,855 --> 01:03:35,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, Xander from Florida, who's on a never-ending quest to save his girlfriend, right?

970
01:03:37,222 --> 01:03:38,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just messing with you.

971
01:03:38,183 --> 01:03:38,584
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up?

972
01:03:40,205 --> 01:03:42,227
[SPEAKER_02]: You forgot to mention Ico on the game endings.

973
01:03:42,888 --> 01:03:43,309
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

974
01:03:43,349 --> 01:03:46,212
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw you guys shouting that in chat, and I totally forgot Ico.

975
01:03:46,272 --> 01:03:47,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, now you said it.

976
01:03:47,573 --> 01:03:48,354
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is, Ico.

977
01:03:48,474 --> 01:03:49,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, Ico.

978
01:03:49,695 --> 01:03:50,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that all you wanted to say?

979
01:03:54,781 --> 01:03:55,381
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

980
01:03:55,662 --> 01:03:56,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, what else do you want to say then?

981
01:03:56,943 --> 01:03:58,264
[SPEAKER_03]: We're running low on time.

982
01:03:58,304 --> 01:03:58,805
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind?

983
01:04:00,476 --> 01:04:08,822
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

984
01:04:30,526 --> 01:04:32,307
[SPEAKER_02]: But no ITGDDR.

985
01:04:34,629 --> 01:04:35,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Xander.

986
01:04:36,271 --> 01:04:38,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Xander, I'm letting you go because you're trying to start fights.

987
01:04:38,653 --> 01:04:39,213
[SPEAKER_03]: But have a good one.

988
01:04:39,233 --> 01:04:39,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for calling.

989
01:04:40,014 --> 01:04:40,834
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just joking around.

990
01:04:40,935 --> 01:04:41,435
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you are.

991
01:04:41,755 --> 01:04:42,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care, Xander.

992
01:04:43,136 --> 01:04:43,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

993
01:04:43,457 --> 01:04:46,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of which, Pump It Up Zero ships to the US Arcades February 1st.

994
01:04:46,979 --> 01:04:48,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Heck yeah, Dave and Busters have got to be there.

995
01:04:49,522 --> 01:04:51,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

996
01:04:52,435 --> 01:04:53,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what's up?

997
01:04:53,416 --> 01:04:54,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, who's this?

998
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:55,577
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Hitstun.

999
01:04:55,877 --> 01:04:57,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Hitstun, what's on your mind?

1000
01:04:58,018 --> 01:05:01,521
[SPEAKER_06]: First time caller, long time listener, radio, whatever.

1001
01:05:02,841 --> 01:05:04,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I breaking up to you guys?

1002
01:05:04,622 --> 01:05:07,464
[SPEAKER_03]: You are breaking up a little bit, but go ahead and get your question out and we'll answer it.

1003
01:05:08,685 --> 01:05:16,890
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really questioning, I think I can explain this, video games, like, taking away the pain, like,

1004
01:05:18,888 --> 01:05:22,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that article you guys are talking about on 1UP or whatever you found.

1005
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:33,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so when you're playing a video game, if you're focused enough on it, it has to be a certain type of video game in which you're constantly focused or else you're going to lose.

1006
01:05:34,575 --> 01:05:37,936
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, something like WarioWare would be most effective for it.

1007
01:05:38,277 --> 01:05:41,538
[SPEAKER_06]: The game completely changes every five seconds.

1008
01:05:42,218 --> 01:05:44,379
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're not totally focused on it, you're going to die.

1009
01:05:44,639 --> 01:05:46,000
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're focused on something else...

1010
01:05:46,618 --> 01:05:49,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for the call.

1011
01:05:50,059 --> 01:05:50,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Appreciate it.

1012
01:06:06,063 --> 01:06:07,125
[SPEAKER_03]: What are they doing to me?

1013
01:06:27,848 --> 01:06:30,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, thank you guys so much for your calls on Skype.

1014
01:06:30,649 --> 01:06:31,709
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to keep it short tonight.

1015
01:06:31,749 --> 01:06:35,010
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very, very sorry, but we are so out of time, you guys.

1016
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:37,870
[SPEAKER_03]: But we do have one more thing for you guys.

1017
01:06:38,130 --> 01:06:41,151
[SPEAKER_03]: How could we forget our newest segment here on Orange Lounge Radio?

1018
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:43,832
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura's Website of the Week.

1019
01:06:46,933 --> 01:06:48,933
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, what's the Website of the Week this week?

1020
01:06:49,173 --> 01:06:51,074
[SPEAKER_08]: The Oregon Trail Online.

1021
01:06:51,154 --> 01:06:51,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Rock.

1022
01:06:51,654 --> 01:06:54,574
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wearing my You Have Died of Dysentery shirt right now.

1023
01:06:54,654 --> 01:06:55,014
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw it.

1024
01:06:55,074 --> 01:06:55,375
[SPEAKER_08]: It's cute.

1025
01:06:55,475 --> 01:06:55,835
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cute.

1026
01:06:58,052 --> 01:07:02,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to read the first paragraph of this page, Remember the old Oregon Trail you used to play as a kid?

1027
01:07:03,218 --> 01:07:08,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we took the best part of the old Oregon Trail, the hunting, and turned it into the new age 3D hunting game.

1028
01:07:09,145 --> 01:07:11,708
[SPEAKER_08]: Our game is packed with squirrels, deer, and buffalo.

1029
01:07:12,229 --> 01:07:16,874
[SPEAKER_08]: The game contains changing scenery and moving clouds, and there's even a trade function so you can purchase more bullets.

1030
01:07:17,786 --> 01:07:20,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, this was made with Macromedia Director 10.

1031
01:07:21,467 --> 01:07:23,647
[SPEAKER_08]: The models were made using 3DS Max 5.1.

1032
01:07:23,907 --> 01:07:25,428
[SPEAKER_08]: They actually put up all their stuff on there.

1033
01:07:25,828 --> 01:07:27,388
[SPEAKER_08]: The textures were done in Photoshop 7.

1034
01:07:28,669 --> 01:07:33,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I actually, I think it's pretty cool that they put up what they did behind us.

1035
01:07:33,130 --> 01:07:34,990
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, you know, for fans of the game.

1036
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:38,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, I tried to play it and it was a little, eh, to me.

1037
01:07:39,151 --> 01:07:45,334
[SPEAKER_08]: But I still think the concept is cool, and I'm glad that someone has recognized the importance of Oregon Trail to our gaming heritage.

1038
01:07:46,235 --> 01:08:05,144
[SPEAKER_08]: This is located at, and I'm just going to read out the whole URL, woz.comtechlab.msu.edu slash courses slash 447SP04 slash Oregon Trail, all one word.

1039
01:08:06,058 --> 01:08:09,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Post that in chat and post it on the forum so our listeners can find it immediately.

1040
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Super.

1041
01:08:11,299 --> 01:08:11,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Good timing.

1042
01:08:11,959 --> 01:08:13,260
[SPEAKER_03]: You timed that right at the end of the song.

1043
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:15,000
[SPEAKER_03]: That was great radio.

1044
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:15,840
[SPEAKER_03]: High five.

1045
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:16,780
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1046
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:18,201
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a radio loser.

1047
01:08:18,221 --> 01:08:19,281
[SPEAKER_03]: We could do this for real.

1048
01:08:19,361 --> 01:08:20,041
Rock.

1049
01:08:21,341 --> 01:08:21,662
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1050
01:08:21,942 --> 01:08:22,322
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

1051
01:08:22,342 --> 01:08:22,942
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the end of the show.

1052
01:08:22,962 --> 01:08:23,542
[SPEAKER_03]: My gosh, you guys.

1053
01:08:23,822 --> 01:08:26,062
[SPEAKER_03]: We did, I think, about three hours worth of show tonight.

1054
01:08:26,082 --> 01:08:27,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Just under three hours worth of regular show.

1055
01:08:29,763 --> 01:08:30,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Busy show.

1056
01:08:30,323 --> 01:08:31,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Controversial show.

1057
01:08:31,084 --> 01:08:31,544
[SPEAKER_03]: I need a cigarette.

1058
01:08:31,604 --> 01:08:32,784
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get lots of emails.

1059
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:35,074
[SPEAKER_03]: But smoking's bad.

1060
01:08:35,134 --> 01:08:35,854
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't smoke.

1061
01:08:35,914 --> 01:08:36,314
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

1062
01:08:36,334 --> 01:08:37,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on.

1063
01:08:37,054 --> 01:08:38,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1064
01:08:38,795 --> 01:08:41,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Miklatov, thank you for being here, at least the small portion of the show you were here.

1065
01:08:42,396 --> 01:08:42,916
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.

1066
01:08:43,197 --> 01:08:43,717
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.

1067
01:08:43,737 --> 01:08:44,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Your final thought?

1068
01:08:44,737 --> 01:08:45,417
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have one.

1069
01:08:45,917 --> 01:08:47,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, your final thought?

1070
01:08:49,114 --> 01:08:54,817
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta get home to watch some ripped copies of the new Family Guy.

1071
01:08:55,277 --> 01:08:56,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully a new Family Guy.

1072
01:08:56,518 --> 01:08:57,518
[SPEAKER_03]: There better be a new Family Guy.

1073
01:08:58,158 --> 01:09:02,300
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is, what is up with those World of Warcraft style Google Maps?

1074
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:04,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people have way too much free time on their hands.

1075
01:09:05,081 --> 01:09:08,423
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, your final thought?

1076
01:09:08,583 --> 01:09:13,825
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to go home and doctor my resume because I have an interview tomorrow.

1077
01:09:14,025 --> 01:09:14,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, good luck with that.

1078
01:09:15,046 --> 01:09:16,146
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm a vegetarian now.

1079
01:09:16,307 --> 01:09:20,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Warlord of the Universe is the position you're applying for, or what?

1080
01:09:20,869 --> 01:09:22,850
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I've been doing this job already.

1081
01:09:23,070 --> 01:09:25,351
[SPEAKER_08]: I may as well have the official title, you know?

1082
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:28,931
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that's it, you guys.

1083
01:09:28,971 --> 01:09:32,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks so much for tuning in and listening to us this week, and we'll be back next week.

1084
01:09:32,812 --> 01:09:42,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Next week on the program, no special guests yet, but we are trying to get someone on the show next week, so I don't want to say who just yet, but we're trying to get someone very closely connected with the Silent Hill franchise.

1085
01:09:42,394 --> 01:09:46,195
[SPEAKER_03]: We're excited to get that person on, so we'll see if we get that.

1086
01:09:46,315 --> 01:09:47,015
[SPEAKER_03]: It's me!

1087
01:09:47,035 --> 01:09:47,655
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not.

1088
01:09:47,675 --> 01:09:48,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, it's not.

1089
01:09:48,416 --> 01:09:49,036
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, and...

1090
01:09:49,827 --> 01:09:50,247
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

1091
01:09:50,307 --> 01:09:57,291
[SPEAKER_03]: So stay tuned for that and of course all the controversy and humor that you've come to expect from your buddies here at Orange Lounge.

1092
01:09:57,611 --> 01:09:59,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Until next week, have a good one.

1093
01:10:01,173 --> 01:10:05,335
