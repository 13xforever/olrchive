620	2921	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of January 2nd, 2006.
3001	13424	You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
13664	17165	Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
18966	20446	Happy New Year, everybody!
20486	25267	You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio, radio about video games that don't suck.
26488	30289	All the news that you true gamers really want to know about, because we care.
31059	35922	and we want to tell you what's going on in the gaming world, even during a slow news week such as this one.
36242	37383	Hope you all had a great new year.
37423	38904	Hope you all had a safe new year.
39364	40185	My name is Rob Roberts.
40205	40985	You might know me as Sky.
41025	44107	Joining me as always, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
44387	46108	The world couldn't handle more than one of me.
46428	47029	How are you doing?
47889	49951	Sober.
50511	52372	We were taping right after our live show, of course.
53008	57555	We did a little bit of drinking on tonight's live show, so Loki and I are a little tipsy.
57795	58716	But we're safe about it.
59237	63443	I live here, and Loki brought the fianc√© to drive, so we're just having fun.
63603	64064	It's all right.
64989	68031	Make this a little more chatty on these slow news weeks.
68191	73395	Exactly, and I'm not throwing up today, so that's great.
73696	74496	Didn't we do this before?
74516	77679	We've done a drunken podcast before, yes.
77699	79560	We've done it before where I haven't thrown up.
79640	82963	It was that one time that I kind of miscalculated how much alcohol I was consuming.
82983	83943	He was sitting on the floor.
84844	88106	Over there in that corner, Loki, since I haven't introduced you, but you're talking anyway, there you go.
88787	91009	Yes, here I am, 13 shots down.
93274	96119	Drinking my drink of choice, which would be a screwdriver.
97742	105695	I'm going to try to shy away from that next time just because orange juice is so acidic it kind of upsets my stomach if I drink too much of it.
107432	109053	DarkSakura
125345	134331	My gaming week has been filled with lots and lots of Animal Crossing and a little Popolo Cross whenever I could get the PSP away from Dan.
134411	145017	However, he has actually gone back and gotten rid of some of our games like Smackdown vs. Raw and his copy of Animal Crossing.
145077	149660	So for those who had Dan on their friends list, he may as well take them all because he ain't playing.
150681	151841	But he picked up Dead or Alive 4.
153175	157136	and the joystick, which I haven't used, but I've heard both ways about it.
157156	160277	I hear it's pretty nice, but people have their own preferences.
161717	163838	That game, though, oh my god.
164698	170900	I'm going to quote something from my husband's live journal, which I think is probably one of the most accurate descriptions of Dead or Alive 4.
172260	173300	And this is the quote here.
175641	179122	It's dead or alive again with really good backgrounds, bad hair, and 100% more hard.
181497	188964	Yeah, what they did, they've gotten rid of some of the recovery time in that game and you have to be freaking fast to do your counters.
189084	189965	It's so much harder.
190505	197572	And on top of that, the boss is like naked Liquid Kasumi and it's like she's, you know, scary.
197732	198713	OMG, spoiler.
200835	201215	So?
201516	202196	It's alright.
202577	203257	It's a fighting game.
203497	204699	Hey, naked.
205059	206040	That's all I needed to hear.
207009	230180	but it's it's just she's ridiculously hard ridiculous that game is just ridiculously hard but the endings are freaking hilarious so all right uh Loki what about your gaming week my gaming week was also filled with a lot of Animal Crossing just I don't know the game is easy to play for like you know 10 minutes or whatever so I've been actually trying to pay off my
230987	231728	Need for Speed Most Wanted
255598	257380	And that game is pretty sweet for the 360.
259222	261464	I'm very impressed on the graphics for it.
262164	265468	And the storyline that they have kind of going along with it is pretty cool.
266449	267910	I definitely like what they've done with it.
268050	270072	It's kind of very involved.
270172	277619	It's very similar to like a Fast and the Furious type of storyline, you know, where your car basically gets...
278740	287846	You lose your car in a match and you have to bring yourself back from nothing to winning the top of the blacklist.
287906	292029	Basically becoming the most wanted driver out there.
292269	293030	And it's very...
294144	295685	Project Gotham Racing 3 Project Gotham Racing 3
321097	333063	Project Gotham 3 is very similar to Gran Turismo, whereas this game is a Need for Speed Underground type game.
335564	339246	The physics aren't exactly accurate to the cars or whatever.
339787	340548	Thanks for watching!
361477	364601	Overall, though, I've played the game not too long.
364641	372649	I played it for about 30 minutes or so today, and I've gotten through kind of the intro storyline stuff and have actually gotten into the game.
373070	382320	It's pretty cool so far, and I like the way that they've done, like, they have live actors in the actual game, but they've kind of blurred them out and kind of, you know...
382993	385995	Desaturated the actors so it kind of blends in with the background.
386035	389176	It's very stylistic but it's a cool game.
390137	408126	So I played that a lot and of course my standard Grand Theft Auto, Liberty City Stories I've been playing a lot of Grand Theft Auto multiplayer and of course Call of Duty 2 multiplayer which I love those games and seriously if you haven't picked up Grand Theft Auto, Liberty City Stories I highly recommend it for the PSP.
408746	410827	It is definitely one of the games to have
411954	415129	for the PSP, and if not anything, just to play around with...
416374	418135	The Trainer, which I'll go into later.
419835	424776	My gaming week, I've also been playing a little bit of Animal Crossing because I took such a break from it because I was playing Final Fantasy Advance 4.
425937	436920	I also was playing a crapload of H.E.R.O., an old school Atari 2600 game that I was playing on GameTap just because I used to play that game all the freaking time on the Commodore 64.
437380	443902	And although the Atari 2600 version really sucks in comparison, it's still one of the better Atari 2600 games and highly underrated.
444309	449113	and the fact that I have the second highest score of all time right now on the leaderboards over there.
449133	450013	Congratulations.
450233	451194	I'm working on number one.
451234	454116	I think it's just because no one plays it because people don't remember that game.
454517	455838	But I'm working on number one.
455878	456278	I want it.
456538	456938	I want it.
457039	457599	It's within reach.
457659	467967	Well, you know, with the one gaming site that does the rankings and stuff, you can actually get... Oh, the... I can't... It escapes me right now.
468047	468607	I can't even remember.
469047	470509	We saw them at Classic Gaming Expo and everything.
470529	470889	Exactly.
470989	473571	They're doing actually certificates now for if you...
474059	474499	Thanks for watching!
490965	491866	DarkSakura.com
508214	512996	You know you are a Nintendo geek when... And then all these lists of Nintendo things.
513377	515558	And I can't read them because I'd make it upside down.
515578	517819	Press up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start.
517939	518719	That's one of my favorites.
519060	519960	But that only works on Konami.
519980	522221	You spent your summer vacation in Hyrule.
522541	522681	Yep.
523062	526063	Anyway, and actually one of my friends in Animal Crossing has a town named Hyrule.
526103	526423	But anyway.
527524	527684	Yes?
528228	535292	When Final Fantasy 3 came out over here, I said that I had the flu and stayed out of school for a week to play it.
535653	538975	I know this is radio, but she did the 3 with quotes.
540175	544218	Not really 3, but 3 does.
544618	549741	DarkSakura got me the shirt, but Loki got me a copy of Mario & Luigi Partners in Time for the DS.
550061	552022	So I finally got a chance to check out this game a little bit.
552843	553864	It's pretty cool.
553904	554344	It's very...
555044	555424	and so on.
582896	585317	So, you know, there's not a lot I can say about it.
585377	591860	If you enjoyed Mario & Luigi Superstar Saga, this is almost the... It's a real true sequel.
592321	593521	It's very similar.
593941	595062	The look is the same.
595422	597583	They haven't changed what worked in that game.
598163	602265	I think if you're a fan of Super Mario RPG, these games are for you, really.
602285	603366	Because that's... Even though...
603706	605748	Super Mario Superstar Saga, Paper Mario Super Mario RPG
620442	629986	Honestly, they need to have another Super Mario RPG just to come out, because that game was so solid.
630026	634248	It was a really good game overall, even if Square was in it.
635128	640290	It just was an awesome game, and they never really are going to touch that level of gaming ever again.
640830	647113	Here's the thing, though, about Partners in Time, and maybe I just haven't played enough into it yet, so I reserve the right to change my mind later, but
647512	649833	I think these games tend to get overrated a little bit.
649973	660017	I think they get looked at as revolutionary or something because they're not like your typical RPG because you press buttons along with the fighting to make it more interactive.
660057	663358	It's not just fight, monster, go, you know, type thing.
663458	664939	You actually hit the button at the right time.
665479	667140	And I don't know though, to me...
668573	670954	I don't think it... It seems to get a little repetitive.
671014	673376	It's like I'm always hitting the button at the same time.
673396	675277	I'm always dodging the same attack.
675657	680580	So it doesn't strike me as so freaking revolutionary as I think a lot of people tend to label this game.
680640	688564	So I don't lavish all this best game of the year praise on it, but I think it's good, and I recommend the game.
688804	694147	But I think there's better RPGs, but it's hard to say.
694187	696168	See, I don't want to get hate mail because...
697096	705841	Well, not that I'm afraid of getting a hate mail, I don't care, but it's the type of thing where it's, you know, I like the game, but I just don't think it's outstanding.
705861	710383	Let me put it this way, there's some that may stand out Nintendo DS games anyways.
711033	721958	I mean, and this is a pretty good... If this was a year ago, I'd agree with you, but now, come on, we got Mario Kart, Meteos, and... Where the fuck else would you see something like Trauma Center?
721978	729421	Well, let me put it this way, okay, this game is good, it's worth picking up, I mean, Nintendo DS games aren't that expensive, you can spend the $30 it is gonna be...
730942	733403	To pick up this game, I mean, it's worth it.
733923	742247	The other game that's going to be coming out that's going to be worth picking up is going to be actually Electroplankton, and that's actually only on the internet.
742947	745328	You're going to be able to find that, because they're only selling it online.
746468	753571	Probably because they think it's too collective of a game, so that one's actually coming out in about a week or so from now.
754272	754632	But, um,
755555	756255	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
787310	791914	Alright, let's get into some news this week and talk about what's going on.
792394	795337	I guess we might as well start it off with a story on the Xbox 360.
795757	799880	Loki, tell us what's going on with the Walmart and the kiosk and all this crazy 360 stuff.
799920	806085	Okay, well Walmart for one, they've actually had a sale that was going on for the first of the year.
806506	815173	They were doing their New Year's Day sale and each Walmart was supposed to be getting 12 360 systems, the premiums of course.
815726	815966	and so on.
840842	842664	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
860740	864621	Are we at the point now where we could actually walk into stores and find these yet?
865042	865182	No.
865522	867262	Because what about this whole thing?
867322	873344	There was a story on Dig.com earlier this week where it's like, search your local Best Buys for 360s.
873404	875865	And I noticed some were popping up in the area, but I didn't believe it.
876125	878226	I wasn't going to waste a tank of gas to go down there.
878246	879427	I did not believe those things were staying.
879467	881907	No, I did post that in my live journal.
882008	885689	There's actually some in the area that said they had them in stock.
886269	892131	Now, personally, I don't know if you had to go and ask if they had them, because I did not see them on the floor.
892151	900373	I was looking, actually, at their games, because I had a gift card to Best Buy, and I was checking out what they had, and it looked very picked through.
900433	909936	They had a few 2K games and Quake 4 and stuff, but there's nothing that really, you know, striked me as, like, ooh, I gotta have this, you know.
909956	910817	It was very...
912250	913911	Thank you for watching!
931107	934151	I don't know why, but it's in the best interest for the gamers.
948149	948569	Exactly.
948650	951772	So this was kind of a sale thing that they were doing.
951792	954494	They were stockpiling them for the sale.
954594	957297	So I'm assuming probably they're all sold out now.
957797	966885	Now, however, you still want to be checking back with your GameStop because they're still trying to fill their pre-orders.
966985	969527	But Best Buy, they should be getting some in each week.
969867	971489	Now, they're probably not going to be on the floor.
971809	974311	You're probably going to have to ask and see if they have them in.
975435	982159	Also, I've heard that Sam's Club has a lot of them coming in and Costco, those type of places.
982199	984040	You want to check and see if they've got them in.
985021	988283	Definitely, at this point, probably don't pay over retail for them.
988323	989443	You can probably find them.
990043	990404	It's just...
991104	994907	It's going to be hard right now because they're still trying to get them out in three different markets.
995547	997448	The European, Japanese, and U.S.
998709	1000050	And they can only make so many.
1000731	1001771	So it's kind of tough right now.
1001811	1011278	Well, it's funny you mention Xbox 360 sales in Japan because I'm actually looking at an article from Nintendojo who ran an article on Japan sales from December 19th to the 25th.
1011678	1014460	Now, why is Nintendojo running a story on the Xbox?
1014500	1015040	Well, they're not.
1015340	1020884	They're actually talking about, hey, the Nintendo DS is the top-selling toy in Japan this week before Christmas.
1021344	1024165	Even though I don't think Christmas is quite the same as it is here.
1024206	1027527	But nevertheless, the DS sold 597,628 units to be number one for the week.
1027547	1028668	The PSP, 161,332 units, making it number two.
1028688	1030508	But get this, Xbox 360, the seventh number.
1040871	1043392	Most Largest Selling System, is that most large?
1043452	1045072	Forget it.
1045092	1045072	5,674.
1045233	1052895	I would completely understand that because if you think about it, a lot of the RPGs that are supposed to come out didn't come out.
1053035	1056777	I mean, Elder Scrolls for one for the US didn't come out.
1056957	1059938	It's not coming out until I think March now.
1060098	1061418	I mean, that's pretty sad.
1061838	1066720	Granted, it is to make the game a lot better because they figured out how to kind of utilize the
1067401	1068622	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1085851	1086231	DOA 4 in Japan
1116591	1141007	3 or 4 big large RPGs that were coming out for the 360 in Japan which is sad because I wish we had gotten some of those over here as well but anyways they were supposed to be getting them and they've gotten delayed and pushed back I think it's probably because a lot of these companies out there that haven't had the 360 dev kits for long enough and they've realized either A they've
1141462	1141862	X-Wash 360 Kiosk
1163965	1165105	Got it hacked somehow?
1165265	1173108	Well, apparently the disks for the kiosks were rushed so badly that they didn't actually sign them and they weren't encoded.
1173268	1181710	So, you can actually get an image of the kiosk disk and download it on your favorite hacker or BitTorrent or whatever site.
1181730	1184931	Not that we endorse that, but we're just reporting on what's out there.
1185111	1190593	But you can download that and actually burn it onto a DVD and run it straight on your 360 and
1191893	1193874	Now, that has opened up a lot of things, though.
1193894	1197736	Because, first off, a few things we've noticed on this.
1198276	1202118	The Xbox Live game, they had a demo for Hexic HD.
1203479	1205100	It's a Shockwave file.
1205180	1208802	It's actually a compact flash type game that's on there.
1208902	1212464	So you can actually run that in Internet Explorer if you wanted to.
1212604	1215585	So no wonder these PopCap games seem to port over so easy.
1215765	1216626	Oh, yeah, exactly.
1216686	1219007	Because it's just running a Shockwave file.
1219507	1220588	And it's really...
1221724	1225312	I don't know, I kind of feel that it's a bit of a rip-off if you think about it.
1225332	1229060	If you're paying $10 for these games, and they're actually Compact Flash.
1229541	1231646	But if it's a really good game.
1232711	1233191	I don't know.
1233291	1242315	But anyways, this does open up a lot of things because now you can actually develop applications for it and rename them to these files and run them in there.
1242455	1245897	So it opens up a huge store for homebrew stuff.
1246257	1249858	The other thing I was actually looking forward to was the fact that
1253880	1261346	These demo kiosks, if you've seen them out there, you can actually bring your Xbox 360 memory unit and download themes.
1261406	1265970	These themes actually correspond with the faceplates you can buy for your 360.
1267691	1270974	Hot Rod, Flames, Woodgrain, whatever they have.
1272615	1280321	The thing is, the files in these themes are actually ping files and you can actually replace them with
1280720	1283321	Your own graphics to create custom themes.
1283761	1290083	The problem is we haven't figured out completely 100% on how to define where these files end or whatnot.
1290264	1293025	And so you can't make your custom themes yet, but it's close.
1293125	1294465	They're going to be coming out with that.
1294605	1296346	So tell me this real quick, and then we'll move on to something else.
1296726	1299467	Because my mind's still back here on the whole rename the Flash thing.
1300067	1304849	So possibly if we could get an emulator, and I know they exist already, an NES emulator in Flash.
1305376	1308098	It could run on this, maybe.
1330163	1334852	You know, a Nintendo game and rename it and put it on a disc with just this.
1334932	1339380	And this is what's great about this is you can actually create your own CD with
1340307	1354332	just this hexic demo or whatever in it and you can put your Flash stuff on there so you can in effect use this file to create your own homebrew with using Flash programs so you can run Flash on the 360.
1354512	1358773	Isn't it amazing that all we want to do with these new systems is play the old ones like with the PSP?
1361194	1369237	I think the thing that's most interesting about this is that the fact that Microsoft was touting that their game system was going to be unhackable and yet they make this
1369477	1369937	and so on.
1391246	1403640	You've got this big huge opening where all the simulation is possible and what they're working on is actually getting to run ISOs on it so that you can run the games that they have ripped off the discs.
1405916	1406376	God of War
1436593	1436974	4.
1436613	1436974	Darwinia
1444865	1445825	Oh, interesting.
1446185	1446366	For PC.
1446386	1447326	Okay.
1448146	1451467	It's the game basically... I love a comment on here.
1451507	1456128	It says, Darwinia proves that the little guy can create something beautiful even if no one is smart enough to actually buy it.
1457409	1458729	Three, Shadow of the Colossus.
1459549	1460029	Yeah.
1460249	1462110	I don't know.
1462170	1464110	I didn't really buy into the hype on Shadow of the Colossus.
1464170	1466271	I thought it was a little... It was a pretty game.
1466691	1468552	It was a very boring game.
1469092	1469432	I don't know.
1469492	1471452	It didn't click with me, but anyway.
1471892	1473393	Number two, Resident Evil 4.
1474403	1478226	Psychonauts was a good game, but I think it was maybe a bit underrated, but still...
1501761	1502201	Average.
1502582	1505704	It wasn't like, you know, wow, it's completely different.
1506124	1512128	Because, you know, the whole game involved you using psychic powers or whatever to, like, manipulate different things.
1512268	1517131	I was also done Advent Rising, which is another game that came out very similar to that.
1517812	1521594	It's not a very revolutionary game, but a good game overall.
1522455	1522815	All right.
1523456	1525057	I think we might get some letters on that one.
1525197	1536685	Speaking of letters, you can always email us at togoe at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura will dig through our mailbag with her nails and her claws.
1536745	1537126	No, I'm kidding.
1537846	1540768	And she'll dig out the best letters and read them here on air.
1541008	1541709	With hot pokers.
1541929	1545572	togoe at orangeloungeradio.com is the address to send those emails to.
1546292	1549134	DarkSakura, what are the kids writing in about this week?
1550575	1550996	Actually...
1553514	1556584	Macman has been writing in quite a bit.
1557555	1560136	Actually, I've gotten more from Actman than I have from Rob.
1560357	1561557	I don't think he's written in at all.
1561577	1563218	Well, maybe he's on vacation for the holidays.
1563238	1564299	He needs to write.
1564399	1565859	I keep thinking of Mathman.
1565919	1567120	Remember Square One Teeth?
1567440	1567800	Forget it.
1568281	1568581	Yes.
1568801	1569221	No.
1569301	1570862	Nerd++!
1570882	1571422	Alright, anyway.
1571882	1572903	You have gained a level.
1572983	1574164	Minus one charisma.
1574184	1574944	Alright, anyway.
1574964	1576165	Minus one INT.
1576185	1576985	Alright, shut up.
1577045	1577465	Be better.
1578986	1581407	I'm just going to quote, and I actually cc'd you on this email.
1581547	1584109	Hey, Loki, of course, whatever you want to say about Max, go ahead.
1584169	1585169	Make my day, of course.
1585569	1586510	You were looking at porn.
1587597	1589619	One of the few fun things to do on a PC.
1589899	1590179	Zing!
1591260	1591861	Oh, snap.
1592501	1593042	Oh, darn.
1593082	1594543	Like, you couldn't do that on a Mac.
1594563	1598226	Whatever.
1598747	1603811	I just don't like Macs because they're cookie-cutter PCs, as I like to call them.
1604291	1610457	That's because you... Just, this debate is... This debate is so 2005.
1610497	1611137	This is so 2005.
1611177	1611678	Exactly.
1612138	1612579	Okay.
1613960	1615161	Also, Krispy Kreme-y.
1615762	1618943	Who's one of our newest people on our website.
1618983	1619283	Donut.
1619984	1620584	Cheesecake donut.
1621844	1622465	Fattening donut.
1622505	1622765	Anyway.
1623985	1628027	Said that our mention on the podcast was so cool that he ran upstairs and told his parents.
1630348	1631348	I don't know what to think of that.
1631408	1637531	I'm glad that parents are involved with what their kids are listening to because this show may not be appropriate for everyone.
1637891	1643553	I just think it's very cool that he's looking forward to the same game I'm looking forward to.
1643773	1644093	What's that?
1645234	1645614	We will
1646278	1647039	Oh, oh, okay.
1647299	1648320	Oh, I see.
1648540	1649481	Oh, that game.
1649521	1649961	Yes, okay.
1651703	1653605	Yeah, that special game where you do stuff.
1653625	1655066	Sorry.
1655146	1656407	I love the stuff game.
1657768	1658149	Whatever.
1658709	1660651	We got an email from Delta One.
1660851	1661512	He's actually a
1662287	1669472	I have to say, pretty insightful as far as the... Okay, where'd the ferret go?
1670433	1671633	I couldn't resist.
1671854	1673815	Suddenly I'm thinking of StarFox.
1674235	1675876	Did I say StarFox?
1676237	1677417	You got that from me.
1677437	1678518	StarFox.
1678838	1680239	The old game, StarFox.
1680440	1684802	On the way up here, I asked, I am Robin, asked if you wanted anything from StarFox.
1684923	1686584	Vodka and OJ, ladies and gentlemen.
1686604	1687905	Alright, I was thinking of StarFox.
1687945	1688305	Okay.
1690686	1692987	I was thinking Star Fox because I watched Symphomy.
1693567	1694688	She said Star Fox.
1695708	1698549	Anyway, we're going to get that explicit tag if you're not careful.
1698629	1699770	Stop using that F-bomb.
1699890	1700130	All right.
1700430	1700650	Okay.
1701650	1705472	He said, you mentioned briefly in your last podcast that the region coding for Japan and the U.S.
1705492	1707152	will be the same with Blu-ray technology.
1707592	1710013	Do you know if this means imported Japanese games will play on U.S.
1710033	1712694	systems and vice versa, or does it only apply to movies?
1713154	1714595	Thanks, and I enjoy the podcast.
1715403	1718425	Uh, actually, it will mean that both games will play on the same systems.
1718786	1725650	Unfortunately, they probably won't put English language in there, so you're kind of screwed in that sense, but yeah, you will be able to.
1725670	1734817	Couldn't, well, but couldn't they do, because we don't really know what PS3 is all about yet, couldn't we see some type of Sony-enabled protection?
1735777	1736638	Or do you think they really care?
1760115	1769827	No, actually Europe and Africa are sharing a region code, so they will not be able to play any of the American or Japanese games.
1769847	1771810	But that makes sense because they're TVs, right?
1771850	1773812	Exactly, they're PAL.
1774093	1775735	But it doesn't matter if you have an HDTV.
1776243	1777243	Yeah, exactly.
1777383	1778904	Or a computer monitor.
1779264	1782125	Not everybody's going to be on HDTV for five years at least.
1782205	1798972	I'm thinking, though, by this next generation of gaming, we are going to start getting to one unified format for the entire world, which would be nice, because then we'd be able to get the games released at the same time instead of waiting, I don't know, six months to release Katamari Damacy, you know, We Love Katamari or whatever.
1800835	1829276	I think it's going to be until we get to like Playstation 4 and that whole gen of games and whatever else decides to come out around then until we start seeing the more like mandatory HD and all that stuff that you guys talk about but that's years and years away assuming there's not another video game crash as some people are predicting actually they're talking about boom in the market so yeah apparently the arcade market's picked up a bit yeah I don't really just from some of the things I've been hearing you know Sega's getting back into into some of that too
1830049	1832731	God bless Sega for showing some love to the arcade.
1832791	1836114	Okay, you know what we need is Planet Harrier on something at home.
1836314	1836734	Thank you.
1837755	1838996	I freaking love Planet Harrier.
1839416	1840637	Any other letters for us this week?
1840978	1846442	Well, I actually basically replied the same and got a pretty excited response from that.
1846542	1846802	Right on.
1847383	1852767	Also, we have an email from one of our long-term fans, AsianBuddyPaul.com.
1853311	1854171	Yes, sir.
1854491	1854991	How's he doing?
1855051	1859112	Just to quote this letter, Happy New Year, Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki.
1859432	1863553	Just wanted to wish you guys another great year of awesome podcasts and memorable live shows.
1864214	1867514	I have good feelings about 2006 for gaming and everything in general.
1868274	1869415	Oh my gosh, the announcement.
1870575	1871735	I totally forgot.
1871755	1873756	Well, wait, wait, wait.
1874916	1875336	There's more.
1875436	1878777	I think this is a quote on here for PS3 Revolution Year of the Dog.
1878817	1879397	Dogs are lucky.
1881394	1882535	I thought that was pretty nice.
1904663	1909607	Both shows will actually be taped live Sunday nights on our station.
1910287	1912949	We're kind of fusing the two shows we have together right now.
1912989	1920655	We're going to fuse those shows together so that you, the listener, can actually participate more in our show by calling in, being in our chat room.
1921095	1921876	It's going to be awesome.
1921896	1926920	We're going to have a whole new level of listener interactivity that's going to go into our podcast.
1926940	1929282	So you're going to hear a lot of those changes starting on the 15th.
1929882	1930723	So it's going to be a good time.
1930763	1931783	So stay tuned for that.
1931823	1933745	More information available on OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
1933945	1941411	We also did get another email from MacMan about having trouble using our site to get into the IRC chatroom.
1941431	1942532	Uh-oh.
1942772	1949217	Which, you know, it goes hand-in-hand with what you're saying about us having that interactive level with our listeners.
1949738	1953881	So I'm thinking maybe we should look into having some sort of Mac-related...
1954241	1955483	Link off of our website.
1970221	1972962	If you have any... Well, I know Java would work on any system, but okay.
1973202	1974263	Well, whatever.
1974303	1983926	With any IRC client, hypothetically, you should be able to connect to any other side IRC as the network, other side IRC, and our chat room is Pound Orange Lounge.
1983946	1988688	But I warn you guys, outside of our live shows, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday nights, it's...
1989208	1990168	Not too active.
1990628	1991709	It's kind of on the dead side.
1991749	1999071	But once in a while we do have our regulars who keep an eye on things and who are policing things that will talk to you if they're there.
1999311	2001711	It is more active, though, in our forums.
2002491	2002892	That's true.
2003012	2003352	The forums.
2003932	2012654	Also, if you sort of want to get an idea of what things are like in our chat room, if you go onto our forums and look at the quote thread under our random chatter, get an idea.
2013074	2013954	Such randomness.
2014295	2014615	Oh, yes.
2015015	2015835	Anything else in our mailbox?
2017608	2020209	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2043424	2061398	I don't know, I forgot something, but apparently, if you actually try to put in a gamertag that's already been used, like, for example, you'll get a message that says, if you believe someone else has registered with your gamertag, please send an email to support at xboxdiamond.com.
2062239	2068924	The only problem is that it's actually xboxdiamondcard.com, not xboxdiamond.
2069364	2070865	xboxdiamond is owned by another...
2072162	2073082	and Cybersquatter.
2073422	2073922	Uh oh.
2074222	2078583	So if you send an email there, you're going to be sending all your personal information to God knows who.
2079363	2079683	Yikes.
2079703	2081904	So you've got to watch out for that kind of stuff.
2082344	2091245	Apparently the domain has been changing hands on eBay because I guess they figured out that the Diamond Card thing was going to be coming out.
2092686	2093066	I don't know.
2093306	2097346	It's just basically watch where you're sending your stuff to.
2097766	2100827	Definitely check the URLs if it's not something that you know
2101471	2102393	is part of the site.
2103194	2104797	I probably don't send an email to it.
2105822	2107763	All right, more news going on.
2108303	2110023	One other quick Xbox 360 related story.
2110083	2115384	I guess it's a little bit redundant because we talked about this game a lot, but I just want to confirm for you guys, Dead or Alive 4 did come out.
2115765	2118685	December 29th is when it shipped, hitting the streets December 30th.
2119065	2120066	Loki, what the hell happened?
2120106	2121666	Why didn't it come out January 2nd?
2121946	2122906	How did they make it out early?
2123286	2129208	Well, the whole thing was is actually, I guess they pushed ahead their shipment.
2129248	2133309	They kind of were overestimating when they were going to have the game out.
2133949	2138074	and they were able to finish it before that and so they were releasing before that.
2138475	2147265	They were basically all they were doing was really tweaking online stuff and once that was all done they pressed it and it went gold and got it out a couple days beforehand.
2147345	2150409	I mean they only really did get it out one day before because
2151087	2151728	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2171513	2182198	Speaking of most anticipated games, we were talking last week about our favorite games of 2005, and now this week I'd like to ask you guys, what is your most anticipated game of 2006?
2183358	2185800	What game are you looking forward to, and why?
2186160	2186940	Loki, start us off.
2188081	2190582	Man, there is so much good stuff.
2190602	2191322	You gotta pick one.
2193280	2193600	PS3, PS4, PS5, PS6
2216639	2217700	DarkSakura, Kingdom Hearts 2
2239282	2240263	Oh, of course.
2240763	2244945	It's so tough because this is a really good gaming year, honestly.
2245965	2249167	It's all about the Steamboat Willie level and Tron.
2249427	2250747	Light Cycles, hello!
2250767	2252608	What do you think about what you've seen of the Japanese version?
2252628	2254009	We see more and more of it hitting the internet.
2254069	2255290	I've seen quite a bit.
2255910	2258771	I still want Aerith to die again.
2259952	2264674	But having a... Having a...
2266286	2267888	More Cloud is always nice.
2267948	2271210	And he's actually, it's actually, I don't know if you noticed his outfit.
2272091	2277294	It's actually Advent Children Cloud.
2277715	2278435	Ah, very cool.
2278595	2285920	See, this is why I want a new Super Mario RPG because they've done it so well with Disney and Square.
2286140	2288762	Why the hell can't they do it with Square and Nintendo?
2290183	2292265	I'm just, they've done it so well.
2292285	2294787	They've really refined the whole RPG thing.
2294967	2295247	It's awesome.
2295984	2298586	P. Diddy said it best, it's all about the Benjamins.
2326923	2327984	I'm not sure about that game.
2328224	2329124	Guardian Hero.
2329464	2331665	It was kind of under the radar.
2331685	2332045	It came out in 2004.
2332085	2336827	You said Guardian Heroes, so I don't know about that.
2336888	2338268	Now Guardian Heroes on the Saturn.
2338548	2341109	Guardian Heroes is freaking sexy, and I have that game.
2342650	2343691	Actually, you want to know what?
2343791	2344671	What?
2344811	2347192	If I am correct, I think it already did get a sequel in Japan.
2348813	2351314	Some of these technically had sequels.
2351394	2353475	Another one on this list here is Chrono Trigger.
2354215	2354655	Yeah, Chrono Cross.
2354675	2358277	But they say that the sequel wasn't really the game.
2358297	2358777	You know what I mean?
2358797	2359317	That it was.
2359597	2363278	I know, but... Chrono Cross was a true sequel.
2363619	2365799	For the purpose of this article, they're calling it a spinoff.
2366280	2367460	But I know, it's a gray area.
2367480	2368000	It's a gray area.
2368380	2369721	Anyway, let's see.
2369841	2370861	So, Kid Icarus.
2371482	2372462	That's a popular choice.
2372662	2373242	Definitely.
2373682	2374623	That's a no-brainer.
2375949	2378572	Comics Zone on the Genesis.
2379193	2380674	No, no.
2381375	2383356	That's that mandatory WTF pick.
2383717	2384778	Skies of Arcadia.
2386299	2386660	Maybe.
2387040	2388001	Sonic CD.
2388922	2389262	No.
2389442	2389742	Yes.
2390003	2390703	Oh, my God.
2390763	2391164	I agree.
2391204	2392345	But with the Japanese music.
2393006	2397530	Grim Fandango, which is another one of those kind of, I never really played it.
2397570	2398110	But here's one.
2398391	2399031	I agree with this.
2399332	2400553	American McGee's Alice.
2401858	2403799	We need more games in the Fantasy Zone series!
2429750	2437173	I would like to see another game in the Mega Man Legends series because I really like those games and I think they're pretty solid RPGs for the Mega Man series.
2459608	2461889	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2482338	2489901	A little piece of advice, because, you know, if we just sat around and played video games all day long, we would have no time to come up with new lists.
2491742	2492342	Exactly.
2492542	2495644	All right, here is DarkSakura with her advice column.
2495664	2501686	And DarkSakura, what are you going to tell all the kids out there on Orange Lounge Radio Land about this week?
2503187	2506788	Today's piece of advice is something very important in the post-holiday time.
2506988	2507228	Yes?
2507629	2509249	How to untangle Christmas tree lights.
2509830	2510570	Oh, this is a good one.
2510670	2510850	Okay.
2511832	2512412	Number 1.
2512833	2514294	Unplug all connected strands.
2514514	2519658	Unplug all strands so your tangle is one containing several knotted sections, not one long knotted strand.
2520118	2521979	The shorter the strands, the less complex the knots.
2522359	2523860	Duh.
2523880	2523860	2.
2524261	2525141	Find a free end.
2525502	2526923	Double duh.
2526963	2526923	3.
2527123	2528203	Loosen all the knots.
2528844	2533247	When the knots are all loose, create a hole through the tangle where free end leaves the mass.
2534208	2533247	4.
2534648	2537150	Roll or wind the free end through each knot in the tangle.
2537250	2539391	Treat the strands gently to avoid breaking the bolts. 5.
2540982	2542583	Untie each successive knot.
2542943	2547226	Keep the free end rolled to make it easier to work with and reduce the amount of cord to pull through.
2548106	2550247	Six, keep the free end under control.
2550427	2551568	Never pull on the free end.
2551648	2552969	Pulling will tighten the tangle.
2553369	2555490	The knot-free section should continue to get longer.
2555710	2557191	Seven, repeat as necessary.
2557691	2560413	But my final piece of advice... Use candles?
2562174	2562734	No.
2563054	2563275	What?
2563815	2565476	Other than you celebrate Hanukkah, I don't know.
2566616	2569937	But no, my final piece of advice is just don't let him get tangled in the first place.
2569997	2571138	It's not that hard.
2574058	2574759	Stop being lazy.
2576279	2577299	That's my final piece of advice.
2577339	2578000	Stop being lazy.
2579540	2590624	Rumors abound that the new World of Warcraft race has been revealed by the February issue of Computer Gaming saying that the new race will be the... And forgive me if I pronounce this wrong.
2591304	2591864	Draenei?
2592938	2598482	D-R-A-E-N-E-I, I've been three weeks without World of Warcraft and I've been drinking tonight, so forgive me.
2598783	2600144	Dry-ni, something like that, dry-ni?
2600804	2603366	I don't think that's exactly how it's pronounced, but anyways.
2604447	2605007	I don't care.
2605047	2605528	I get you.
2606228	2607169	It's basically this.
2607389	2611092	You guys, I'm sure you've seen this on most of the gaming websites out there anyway.
2611152	2613133	We're just kind of beating a dead horse here, but...
2614028	2615028	But what do we think?
2615068	2616649	Is this actually legit or what?
2617029	2632113	Well, first off, let me add that Computer Gaming Magazine has come out and said that this source is not official, but it is basically a highly rumored source that this is what the next alliance race is going to be.
2632933	2638495	Also, I'd like to add my coworker, who is a huge World of Warcraft fan, says that a lot of the...
2639375	2644760	Storylines point that this is going to be the next likely race that's going to be for the Alliance.
2645741	2648784	Just because they're trying to balance the Alliance and horde races.
2649045	2650466	Yeah, the Alliance needs some ugly people.
2650866	2652448	Exactly.
2653469	2655090	DarkSakura, any thoughts on this?
2655110	2658153	I haven't played any World of Warcraft in months and I still need to renew my account.
2659054	2661537	I wish the Pandaren rumors were more true.
2661877	2663759	Unfortunately, the Chinese are a bitter race.
2667335	2669176	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2696175	2698436	Legends for PC by Ubisoft.
2699417	2706962	Then three games that are all the same for Xbox, PC, PS2, Rugby Challenge 2006, because it's all about men getting each other bloody.
2708122	2711244	Unfortunately, I don't think that game's going to have any blood, so darn.
2712765	2715086	31st, Top Spin for Game Boy Advance.
2716027	2723772	Other games that are undated, we have Dragon Ball Z Supersonic Warriors 2, Sega Classics Collection, which is actually a pretty good collection.
2724560	2729226	Space Invaders Evolution, and drumroll, we love Katamari.
2729246	2731269	About time, you guys.
2731309	2732030	Seriously.
2732748	2736290	The US isn't getting too much as far as January releases.
2736330	2748916	The big ones being 25 to Life, which I believe is coming out the third week in January, as well as MVP 06 NCAA Baseball, College Baseball.
2748996	2750957	Those are the two big games for the month.
2751978	2757401	Painkiller Hell Wars is still to be announced because it's been shifting hands from Atari to 2K Games.
2758562	2762487	and a lot more stuff to come in February, including my favorite, Full Auto.
2764730	2767574	UK and US release dates for your gaming pleasure.
2767654	2770298	Alright, we're winding down here, but first off...
2770948	2772749	Loki, what's this about?
2772829	2773850	Some cheat thing?
2774170	2775931	If it's a cheat, I know you found it.
2775971	2777432	What the hell's going on here with Liberty City Stories?
2777452	2780494	Okay, Liberty City Stories, they have this nice cheat program.
2780534	2784996	It's actually a modified save game that you use as a trainer.
2785096	2787938	And you actually have a bunch of different cheats you can toggle on and off.
2788979	2793381	This right here is basically what I play when I'm sitting at home.
2793441	2799545	You can actually, some of the cheats that they've created so far, Unlimited Health, Heavy Motorcycles, which is my favorite.
2799895	2800756	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2822392	2823273	All these different things.
2823373	2826055	And that kind of opens a huge door to homebrew stuff.
2826375	2834060	But if you haven't gotten it already, if you already have Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, I highly recommend that you download this cheat program for Liberty City.
2834120	2835221	It's just a save file.
2835281	2835902	You load it up.
2836522	2837763	It's a lot of fun to play with.
2839584	2840085	Alright, sounds good.
2840105	2841306	Anything else you got for us tonight, Loki?
2842849	2845753	The other thing I have tonight is actually kind of a rumor.
2846173	2850639	It's basically this thing that Nintendo's kind of trademarked.
2850719	2852642	It's called Nintendo Floor Vision.
2853443	2857889	And a lot of people are kind of wondering what the hell is Nintendo Floor Vision.
2858289	2862670	And obviously the first thing that comes to mind is, hmm, maybe it's something that has to do with the revolution.
2863210	2867391	And hmm, maybe it's something that has to do with the revolution being, I don't know, stereoscopic 3D.
2868331	2878734	One of the things that they think on Joystick.com is that it's actually kind of something that we saw at like E3, one of those kind of LCD panels where you can step on it and interact with it.
2879074	2881195	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2905865	2907686	Pong Movie in Development
2927726	2934972	I... It is supposedly written by Stephen E. D'Souza, who's writing Tomb Raider... I'm sorry, who wrote... Oh, bullshit!
2935012	2935732	Lord from Tomb Raider.
2936853	2940216	I... Huge grain of salt with this one, kids.
2940296	2942818	I think, um... I know, there's just...
2944173	2944253	Hey!
2944353	2947254	I'll say what, if you believe in the Pong movie, I've got some igloos to sell you.
2947334	2947354	I...
2963692	2965013	Huge grain of salt with this.
2965213	2970075	I'm not exactly going to comment on whether this is a good or bad thing because I don't think it's real.
2970095	2970836	Let me put it this way.
2971056	2975498	I'd be able to believe it a little bit more if it had Ui Bo attached to it.
2976078	2982982	But since it doesn't, I'm going to have the call that this is really stupid and a dumb attempt to make a joke about a movie.
2983362	2986523	Now, if it really comes out, you're going to look like an ass.
2986664	2987224	Exactly.
2987364	2993227	However, though, I do have to say, though, since they did announce that Pac-Man, the movie, is actually going to happen...
2994329	2996750	You know, I'm about to believe anything you write about that.
2996770	2997631	We have Pac-Man the cartoon.
2997671	2998431	It makes sense to me.
2999612	3001773	Why the fuck do they need Pac-Man the movie?
3002233	3005535	Honestly, we had Pac-Man Fever, the song.
3005575	3006235	We've had it all.
3006275	3009357	Listen, they said that it might not even be a CG movie.
3009397	3010537	It might be live action.
3010637	3011598	That would be stupid.
3012038	3012718	Exactly.
3013059	3013859	Stupid.
3014559	3015240	Listen, people.
3015400	3017361	Honestly, you're worried about, you're wondering why.
3017381	3018922	Hmm, people are not going to see.
3019422	3021603	It'll be like puppets, like Team America World Police.
3023024	3023324	Forget it.
3024275	3025916	It's going to be stupid no matter what you do.
3025936	3029497	I'd say we're going to wrap it up here with our final thoughts.
3029557	3029817	Loki.
3030537	3035098	My final thought is I have 13 shots in me and I'm doing good.
3035998	3041100	My final thought is I'm feeling much better and I think I'm going to get a little bit of food now.
3041240	3042160	DarkSakura, your final thought.
3044481	3048262	As usual, reject false icons and stop watching TV.
3048945	3050526	Oh, and I have one little thing to add.
3051306	3056088	Xbox Live, if you do have an Xbox 360, a lot of cool demos that they've added lately.
3056488	3059389	Condemned and Quake 4, definitely check those out.
3059809	3063250	It's a really good thing to be able to check these games out before you actually buy them.
3063570	3064251	Loki, show's over.
3064551	3064791	Sorry.
3064971	3065211	All right.
3065831	3066532	Have a good one.
3066832	3068692	We'll see you next week here on Orange Ledger.
