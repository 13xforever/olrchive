13931	20175	Orange Lounge Radio Good evening everybody, welcome to Orange Lounge Radio episode number 170 for this January the 15th of 2006
41846	44327	That's right, it's our first show of the new format.
44347	48649	We've kind of taken our live show and our podcast and sort of combined the two together.
49029	53791	So if you're wondering, hey, wait a minute, when the hell did things go from episode 54 to 170?
54391	61934	Well, that's because we here at Orange Ones Radio have actually been doing a live program for the past three years solely dedicated to music and rhythm games.
62314	68737	But tonight the show has come together for the first time to allow our listeners to actually interact with the program as well.
68817	69717	My name is Rob Roberts.
69737	70718	You might know me as Sky.
71118	74380	Joining me, as always, say hello to DarkSakura.
74400	74860	How you doing?
76200	77481	Oh, what am I not doing?
77561	78461	Oh, how am I doing?
78501	79062	I'm sorry.
80322	81663	Fairly decent.
82003	82283	Yeah?
82443	83684	Fairly decent, I can say.
83904	84224	Good.
84504	84844	All right.
85065	85765	How you doing over there?
85925	87566	Loki, our other co-host, Tech Master Loki.
88126	88886	I'm doing good.
89427	89627	Good.
89767	90127	Excellent.
90947	92368	And since we have...
93795	94215	Shane Miklatov
117461	118702	I just got hit by a blue shell.
119002	122024	Are you playing Mario Kart during the show?
122324	122584	Yeah.
122845	123165	Alright.
123645	138335	For those that don't know Miklatov, since he's kind of new to our podcast listeners, Shane's an old friend of ours that actually, now he works for Konami, but with all those NDAs, we're not allowed to say what he does or what he's doing or any of that stuff, right?
138355	142657	If you look at instruction manuals for games, you can totally find out what I do and what I'm doing.
143098	144338	Alright.
144499	146680	Just kind of look at it, but it doesn't say Miklatov, right?
148317	149357	Ultramix 3 does.
149778	150158	Does it?
150358	150638	Yes.
151899	153579	So can you tell us what you did for Ultramix 3?
154380	155920	Steps.
157001	161002	So when people play DDR, you create the steps they dance to?
161102	161583	Yes, I do.
162023	162363	Awesome.
163024	166905	All right, well, we are interactive with our chat room and our Skype line tonight.
167125	169285	www.orangeloungeradio.com.
169305	172766	Click on Interact With Us to get more information on joining the chat room.
172786	179227	Remember, since the show is podcast as well, you guys really can't interact with us if you're listening through the podcast stream.
179247	181047	That's just incentive to be here on Sunday nights.
182488	188729	But, of course, you can always drop in there because we have other live shows that go on throughout the week, and it's a good time.
189716	190596	It is our first show.
190656	192157	I'm feeling a little good about this.
192197	194698	A little bit of a change going on here.
195658	199340	At the same time, I'm a little nervous, but I'm hoping you guys like the change.
199380	200600	I'm feeling good about the change, though.
200640	201761	What do you guys think?
201821	202601	Are you happy with this?
203347	208168	Um, no, I'm just depressed as I can be, and my heart is broken.
208868	209588	I feel awful.
209948	211248	No, I'm actually pretty happy with it.
211548	213249	A piece of you has died inside.
213929	216809	My soul is dark and empty!
217109	231512	I think the biggest shock will probably come to people that have listened on the podcast, because we had such a, you know, like, da-da-da-da-da-da, like, we were always just, like, going down this bullet list of things, but now we have a little time to relax, because we're going to be two hours now, so our podcast is broken up into sections, which means you'll get it
232230	233651	DarkSakura, how's your gaming week been?
233691	234712	I'd have to say it's been pretty lame.
234732	235312	Why is that?
235332	239296	All I've played is Animal Crossing just because I'm getting ready to start my next semester.
239396	241757	Next week, God help me.
261579	269451	That and I have a pretty nasty sinus infection so I've been getting motion sick every time I play anything Even Animal Crossing, doesn't that suck?
270613	272656	Motion sick playing Animal Crossing?
272876	273918	Fluid in my head
275003	277285	Something that you don't really hear a lot about sometimes.
277325	283010	I mean, we always see those warnings before we start to play video games, but we never really hear about a lot of experiences.
283470	287193	I am one of those people who gets motion sick playing first person shooters or watching them.
287834	289675	Have you ever taken things to try it?
289835	291517	You know how people get cars to take Dramamine?
291537	297382	Dramamine is like, it makes you pass out and it's really nasty stuff and not good for you at all.
298055	302036	I've tried taking Ginger before trying to play Goldeneye back on the N64.
302576	305357	Goldeneye is the first video game I've ever played that made me throw up.
306877	307757	That's hardcore, though.
308137	318619	I was watching Dan play it, and I wanted to do the two-person, but also if the screen is split like that with the two-person mode, I can't do it even more, even on PSO.
319820	321060	Sonic Adventure made me nauseous.
321670	324092	But I love that game and I just sort of push through it.
324272	329196	I was going to say, is there ever a point where you're just like, screw it, I'll just get sick just to play this game?
329797	331578	Katamari Damashii makes me very motion sick.
331738	336863	That's like how I get sick if I eat really spicy foods, but once in a while it's like, screw it, I want Mongolian barbecue, I want it all.
337443	341907	Well, I did actually start to put Beatmania in and then Dan got sick.
343088	345990	He turns into such a baby when he's sick.
346550	348352	But he's not motion sick, he's like virus sick.
350317	351838	Yeah, he's got the flu or something.
352498	353118	He's feeling better.
353758	364082	But I did play DDR at Fry's today, and whatever ignition pad, fake pad thing they have there is a piece of ass, as in a skanky piece of ass.
364822	367663	So it was like, right in the middle, you know where you stand?
367683	369004	It's where the left arrow was.
369687	370868	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
394693	396114	We are international!
416448	419049	And I shouldn't be giving them free advertising, but...
445851	447072	I'm getting an Intel iMac Jump to a Mac
466013	467494	I'm sorry, what planet are you from?
467574	470156	You can address those cards and letters to Loki at Orange Laundry.
470176	474659	I'm going to have a system that will run circles around your PC.
474679	476961	Wow, look at all that Mac gaming out there.
477001	478062	Wait, oh wait, I'm sorry.
478262	480504	Excuse me, I'm a graphic artist.
480564	481084	Hello?
482205	483466	I'm a graphic artist.
483546	485227	Well, I'm glad it can do something.
486108	488189	You are so full of shit.
488269	490371	I love getting to start off the new show with a good fight.
491979	492680	Jerry!
492960	494000	Jerry!
494180	502604	It's because he is holding on to this antiquated idea that a Macintosh is for losers when actually it is far superior to practically any PC.
502704	507946	And on top of that, I can install Windows on my damn Mac with my new iMac if I want to.
508526	508987	Breathe in.
509147	510267	Calm down.
510467	510948	Breathe in.
511168	513729	What is this Dell crap popping up on my laptop anyway?
513769	517170	See, I won't have to put up with Dell crap popping up on my computer anymore.
517190	517270	Dell.
517290	517691	All right.
520655	522916	Anything else to share about your gaming week?
523376	527257	I need some rope and a big stick and some fire.
527797	529317	I'm going to roast me a co-host.
529517	531278	Loki, how was your gaming week?
531938	533238	My gaming week was good.
534638	536639	I played a lot of Animal Crossing.
537259	541620	I don't know because I'm too lazy to set up game systems to play any console systems or whatever.
543100	546621	Then I played a little bit of Call of Duty 2.
547121	550202	I'm more of the single player and some of the multiplayer because it's just fun.
550776	551877	But I did buy more games.
551957	554718	I bought DOA 4, haven't played that yet.
555139	558441	And I was trying to... Boobie Fight 2006?
558621	559521	Exactly.
559601	562323	It says it has partial nudity in it, which is pretty sweet.
562723	565365	It's very promising to have a game that has partial nudity in it.
566025	569507	Aren't some of those costumes just partial nudity on their own, though?
569588	569808	I guess.
569828	570888	It is kind of disappointing.
571028	574751	I'm still waiting for Rumble Runs' XX in a couple months.
574891	575891	That game's going to be hot.
576512	576932	So hot.
577292	578433	It's got bears in it.
579079	579880	Thanks for watching!
592811	597675	There's going to be that Final Fantasy XI beta that's going to be in the next official Xbox magazine.
598155	599837	So that should be coming out in a couple weeks.
600037	600837	Is that already out there?
600857	606902	Because I'm looking on message boards and I'm seeing... You know how a lot of people are using their little Xbox gamer cards and their signature now?
607263	611326	And you can see the little boxes that show what accomplishments they've gotten lately?
611346	612727	Have you seen those with the stars?
612947	613287	Yeah.
613507	620973	Okay, I saw somebody who's on a random message board the other day, because I lurk on a lot of message boards out there, and somebody had a Play Online square in theirs.
620993	621714	And I was like, wait a minute!
622806	623587	When did this happen?
623727	625068	When did the PlayOnline thing happen, Ari?
625108	626409	Well, it might have already.
626429	626870	I'm not sure.
626890	629392	I haven't really looked to see if the magazines are out there yet.
629752	633255	I believe it was the 16th is when the official newsstand date.
633355	634816	Okay, well then that would be tomorrow.
635076	635297	Yeah.
635717	637218	Well, people get it early still.
637258	637478	Yeah.
638259	639400	So, I don't know.
639440	642923	I guess the people that have subscriptions might have already gotten them already.
643483	646866	I have a subscription, but you know how it takes eight weeks and all that kind of crap.
647266	647767	So, um...
648885	650005	Yeah, I'm looking forward to that stuff.
650125	652026	But right now, I just haven't been playing too much.
652306	654907	I want to really get back into playing more console games.
655407	659708	There are some games coming out that I want to check out for the PlayStation 2 and stuff.
660108	666910	And I tried acquiring a game for the PSP, DJ Max, that beat Mania Korean Sim type thing.
668471	670692	But it's a little bigger than my memory card.
673452	674633	I actually remembered one more thing.
674933	675093	Hmm?
675552	685339	We were going to break out the Turbo Duo because I now have, thanks to one of our good listening friends, Space Fantasy Zone.
686801	689423	Wasn't that one of those games you kept saying you wanted?
689723	691184	It was a prototype.
691604	692185	Wow.
692365	694687	And I now have Space Fantasy Zone.
694987	702312	And Emerald Dragon, which actually I don't think I can play because I'd need to have an arcade card, which the Duo never had.
702352	704414	It had, I think, up to the second card.
704775	707497	So that means I actually have to find a DuoRX now to be able to play it.
708537	708798	Alright.
709358	710559	Anything else in your gaming week, Loki?
711019	712400	Nope.
713100	714541	Actually, my gaming week wasn't that exciting.
714561	715702	I haven't played a whole lot of new stuff.
715722	717443	I've been playing a lot of the same old stuff.
717563	729871	Again, we don't really get free copies of games from people, so whenever any of us talk about a new game we've played, most likely we have went out and bought it if we didn't borrow it from somebody or, I don't know, Loki hacked something.
730872	732613	But I know for me, I usually buy it.
733459	741681	I'd like to add, just real quick, since you mentioned buying games, because I have been the bee in a company that sells games, I can use them as tax write-offs.
741861	744061	I'm writing off $900 worth of games this year.
744141	744821	Lucky you.
744861	745442	Stop rubbing it in.
745922	746282	Sorry.
747142	749142	So, I've just been enjoying old games.
749182	750723	I've been enjoying some of the greatest hits of 2005.
751083	754023	I've been doing Animal Crossing and Meteos.
754043	755604	I actually got back into Meteos again and...
757017	764104	This dude over here in the corner got me suckered back into World of Warcraft, which I was going to cancel my account.
764765	768548	And then Miklatov was like, no, you should come play on his server.
769509	771311	So now I'm playing a Horde character.
771471	773333	So it's interesting.
773413	774354	It's different than the Alliance.
774605	775305	I'll tell you what I'll do.
775625	775805	What?
776185	778986	I will go ahead and renew my World of Warcraft and I will play with you.
779586	779926	Sweet!
780166	782467	I'll make my zombie chick again.
782927	783487	Sounds awesome.
783527	784867	I'm playing a troll.
785227	786588	I'm playing on Bronzebeard.
786608	787908	My zombie's on Bronzebeard.
788048	788348	Right on.
789088	791589	I don't want to say what server, but I'll let you know offline.
791949	796550	I don't care because I haven't touched the game in three months, but I'll play again if you're playing.
797110	797851	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
810524	812726	Still cannot find an Xbox 360.
812766	817689	I've been using that Best Buy locator thing we talked about a couple shows ago that you had in your live journal.
818329	821491	And I was just driving around to random places, you would think.
821692	824573	I went Target, Walmart, Circuit City.
824593	826315	I mean, no one shops at Circuit City anymore.
826735	828456	Yet somebody's buying up all their Xbox 360.
828536	830557	At least in this area, nobody shops at Circuit City.
830678	831698	It's a ghost town all the time.
833079	834020	But no Xbox 360s.
834040	836301	They told me they wouldn't have new ones until February.
837222	838062	That could be about right.
838163	839543	I want to get my geometry wars on.
839563	840144	This isn't fair.
841198	844060	Damn you Microsoft for your supply shortage stuff
867762	868402	Thanks for watching!
891924	895627	I urge everybody out there, do not support the Xbox 360 black market.
895927	902271	You are continuing to rob people like me of an Xbox 360 because that's who's buying them is people who wants to put them on eBay.
905793	913378	It's harder for me to get upset at the people that are buying them and putting them on eBay mostly because I know some people doing it even though I told them, you make me cry.
916000	919362	If people weren't buying them and paying those hideous prices for them,
919687	920728	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
942788	945729	I finally passed 1,000 wins on Mario Kart DS.
946249	946529	Right on.
946729	949890	That's all we do at work on breaks is play Mario Kart DS.
950170	951491	So it's pretty nice.
953451	958313	Other than that, I sold Animal Crossing because I don't have time for it because I have Mario Kart.
958393	959693	Yeah, because you're too busy with Mario Kart.
959733	960653	Yeah.
960993	965535	And I started playing World of Warcraft again and City of Heroes and Final Fantasy XI.
966650	968351	So I'm a big nerd.
969051	969811	That's all I do.
970711	978794	Now, the listeners would kick my ass because you work for Konami, and I know you have all these non-disclosure agreements and stuff, but I have to ask.
978814	985476	We're going to talk about this a little more in depth later in the show, but surely you have something you can say on DDR Supernova?
985956	988757	It's totally a DDR game that's for the arcades.
990917	992078	Bet you didn't know that.
994699	995799	In other words, he ain't budging.
996809	1004351	We're going to have to get somebody from the higher-ups in Konami and Gorillam here on this show to figure out the details on what's going on with Supernova.
1004371	1005871	We'll talk more about DDR Supernova.
1006611	1013693	I imagine most people, or a lot of people that listen to this show probably started on our music stuff, so they know we're really excited.
1013733	1023255	You know, there was a lot of interesting talk in our forums and our LJ community live journal about, isn't it ironic that the week after Orange Lounge says...
1024099	1026140	We're not going to do the Bomani stuff anymore.
1026240	1031181	Suddenly, doo-doo, we've got a brand new DDR game in arcades.
1033801	1041443	It's not like we're going to stop talking about Bomani and music-based games at all, because they're still really important, obviously, and we still really love them a lot.
1041483	1044664	We just don't want to only talk about that anymore.
1045544	1045824	Anyway.
1046384	1048285	There is more to life than to DDR.
1048485	1049165	There is, there is.
1049225	1052986	We're gaming fans first, music game fans second, so that's an important thing to remember.
1053829	1060614	Anyway, before we get into tonight's news, we want to say a big special extra hugs and thank yous to Middyhead, speaking of DDR.
1061174	1067158	Middyhead created songs, you know, he's been a musician for a while and does stuff for TV and movies.
1067198	1067758	It's pretty cool.
1068679	1071201	But he also did some songs that turned out in DDR and some remixes.
1071541	1073282	He also did our brand new intro you heard tonight.
1073602	1075503	So that was very nice of him to do that.
1075784	1076584	I like it a whole lot.
1076664	1077405	It was awesome.
1077485	1080587	So if you want more information on his music, you like that little...
1081227	1082127	stuff we had in the beginning.
1082167	1085109	MidiHead.com is his website with more information, so it's pretty cool.
1086129	1088590	Anyway, let's get into some gaming news tonight.
1088670	1092011	Loki, what's going on with the Xbox 360?
1092111	1097793	Speaking of how I can't find one, and they've had these sales goals and all this stuff, what's up with this?
1098073	1105416	Well, first off, basically, it's just been a nightmare trying to find a 360 and that type of stuff, but...
1107364	1111727	Right now they've sold about 600,000 units in the United States.
1111988	1121315	Of course, that's quite short to their original goal of 3 million in three months, being that we're on month two here, and 600,000.
1122035	1133084	So yeah, they actually went back on their original announcement that they were going to do 3 million, and now have kind of updated that to 5.5 to 6 million units by June 30th.
1134304	1140390	So now it's kind of like, oh, we're just going to put the finish line further out there so we can sell more.
1140450	1143412	I think the problem is, are they going to make 3 million units in 90 days?
1144153	1145594	Are they even going to be able to produce them?
1146255	1156184	Well, the problem was before, and the whole thing that kind of delayed stuff, was that they ran into the problem, of course, with the overheating GPUs and that type of thing.
1156584	1160768	And because of that, they've had to do more quality control and kind of,
1161445	1163346	Just basically slow down the whole process.
1163406	1172471	Now they've added another manufacturing plant and they've kind of ironed out this overheating issue so hopefully they're going to be up to speed.
1173411	1175012	I still don't think they're going to make their goal though.
1175533	1176873	Not by a long shot.
1179955	1182336	So how many of these things have they actually sold since the launch?
1182937	1185558	As I said, 600,000 so far estimated.
1185938	1188560	Now there are other sources saying 1.3 million.
1188780	1190221	I'm going to go with the 600,000 though.
1192386	1193847	All right.
1194747	1195488	Lowball it.
1195608	1196768	That way you don't get disappointed.
1197889	1199030	All right.
1199050	1203472	Moving on in the news, you might have heard this week that Tetris DS was kind of a surprise announcement.
1203972	1205934	Tetris is going to be coming out for the Nintendo DS.
1206334	1215259	It's going to be coming out at the end of March, and it's going to support up to 10-player multiplayer, if you're all in the same room, 4-player Wi-Fi.
1215979	1218201	So that's still kind of cool that they're taking Tetris Wi-Fi.
1218681	1224486	And also, they're going to be incorporating old 8-bit Nintendo classics into this somehow.
1224526	1229930	If you see the early screenshots, you can see Mario Brothers and some things like that in the early screenshots.
1229950	1232472	So it's very interesting because we don't know yet exactly how that works.
1232932	1237056	But we assume it has something to do with maybe the battle setup or something like that.
1238257	1240478	I don't know if it's just me, but I'm really excited about this.
1240498	1242620	But of course, I'm a big puzzle game whore to begin with.
1242680	1245002	So finally having Tetris on the DS is pretty cool.
1246838	1248459	No, I don't think it's good.
1248700	1248960	Why?
1249180	1252542	Because 4-player ruined Mario Kart Online.
1252562	1254363	4-player will ruin Tetris Online.
1254383	1259146	Wait, wait, wait, wait, this coming from the guy who just proudly proclaimed, I have a thousand wins!
1259226	1260587	Okay, but that's not online.
1260807	1273555	Online mode for Mario Kart DS is really stupid, because one, it's hard to find 4-player sometimes, and two, if somebody doesn't get first, they turn off their system, and so then you're down to three, or two, or then just finally one.
1274170	1275311	Tetranet Tetranet Tetranet
1291972	1293453	with the item usage and everything.
1293793	1296935	It's not the fact that it's online, it's that they're limiting it to four players.
1297115	1297916	That's my problem.
1297936	1299437	But wasn't Tetranet six?
1299937	1300958	Limited to six or four?
1301738	1303460	It's been so long since I played Tetranet.
1303480	1307062	I know it was more than four, but I want to say it was like five or six was the most that you could have.
1307082	1308483	That's still not much more than four.
1309429	1309629	No.
1309909	1310890	Well, ruin Mario Kart.
1310930	1312351	I just don't have high hopes for Tetris.
1312371	1313152	Well, wait a minute then.
1313252	1318476	If you're into this local area gaming thing, then doesn't the 10 player... Yeah, that's cool.
1318536	1318916	That's cool.
1318996	1325301	I'm just, I'm sad that Nintendo has to go and either limitations on their software or whatever make it for players.
1326162	1329724	I just have bad experiences with Mario Kart online, so... It's probably the network.
1329904	1335869	But do you think Tetris is going to suffer from the same problem where people turn off their DSs if they lose too quick and then you have connection error...
1337372	1338052	Probably.
1338272	1340673	You know, there are some people that are just that competitive.
1340853	1343193	And if they lose, they don't want it to count against their record.
1343694	1347575	Haven't I bought this game before like six, seven times already?
1347975	1349995	Stop making Tetris!
1351035	1352416	It's the same damn game.
1352456	1354656	They haven't improved anything at all in this.
1354676	1356797	It doesn't need to have anything improved.
1357317	1358497	It's almost the perfect game.
1358777	1360958	Tetris is like quack.
1361849	1365751	When are you going to get into a room with 10 people wanting to play Tetris at the same time?
1365951	1366831	Anime conventions.
1367031	1368572	Yes, I guarantee that.
1369232	1371133	Or no, get this.
1373854	1375315	Imagine being on an airplane.
1376515	1380257	You're bored to death and random other people are playing Tetris and you can play Tetris with them.
1380597	1383858	And then the plane crashes because you're not supposed to play those wireless things.
1384359	1385019	Actually, yes, you can.
1386187	1386908	Oh yeah, that's right.
1386928	1387788	When you're in the air, you can.
1388288	1389289	Once you're in the air, you can do it.
1389309	1389669	That's right.
1390129	1390810	It's totally true.
1391190	1397194	The fourth time I saw Brokeback Mountain, we took our DSs in the theater and there were people playing Mario Kart.
1397214	1399635	So we played Mario Kart during the previews with people in the theater.
1399735	1402437	So Tetris really could work just randomly anywhere.
1402677	1404538	Imagine like a big sports game or a concert.
1404578	1405499	I bet it's the same deal.
1405699	1407160	I've done PictoChat standing in line.
1408060	1409721	I've seen lots of people do that too.
1410042	1410522	I mean, it's...
1411184	1411584	Crazy.
1411704	1415627	The last time I did the massive PictoChat where there was a lot of other people was E3.
1416007	1420370	I did PictoChat at E3 standing in the line to play Nintendogs.
1422512	1429736	I was doing it in the line waiting to get in, and I remember seeing all these people writing on their PictoChats, OMG, it's Gary Coleman, OMG, OMG.
1430037	1433919	And then I looked to my right, and sure enough, Gary Coleman's standing right there.
1433999	1435680	I'm like, oh, OMG, it really is him.
1436021	1436801	It's just kind of funny.
1436981	1440984	I was doing PictoChat and saw a familiar name looked up, and it was Shark's Girl.
1443114	1445135	She was in the other line next to me
1465832	1466914	Oh, now, wait a minute, though.
1466954	1472884	Tetris also launched the Game Boy and was the launch title of the most successful system of all time.
1472904	1473425	Okay, that's it.
1473745	1476269	No more Tetris for any next-gen consoles, ever.
1477594	1478655	Sony, hear me out.
1479015	1479916	No more Tetris.
1480196	1481297	No Tetris on your system.
1481538	1486762	If they come up to you and say, we want to make Tetris for your system, you say, no, I will not have this crap on my system.
1486982	1488123	More Tetris.
1488203	1489905	Bring us Tengen Tetris.
1490005	1493028	Wait, remember the Tetris on the PlayStation?
1493168	1495170	It sucked because they changed the formula.
1495710	1500734	Instead of just being the little blocks, they had the little guy that would climb on the blocks and you weren't supposed to kill him.
1500995	1501895	It was so stupid.
1502436	1503457	That was what, Tetris World?
1504099	1504741	I don't remember what it was.
1504782	1505464	Tetris suck.
1505524	1506708	That's what I call it.
1506849	1508474	Who remembers Blastress?
1510069	1511450	with the Super Scope 6.
1512331	1513071	Oh, that one.
1513652	1514693	The Super Scope 6 game.
1514713	1515593	Yeah, I remember that one.
1515613	1517375	I played the hell out of Blastris.
1517515	1518856	Who remembers Hatris?
1519336	1520637	I remember Hatris.
1520817	1521518	Wordtris?
1521658	1522779	What about Tetris Sphere?
1522899	1523999	That was awesome.
1524039	1526121	Tetris 2, Bomb Bliss?
1526261	1527482	Yeah, I remember that.
1527662	1530064	They all sucked compared to the original.
1530104	1531545	Hey, Tetris Sphere was awesome.
1531805	1534067	It's all about cooperative mode on Tengen Tetris.
1535848	1536709	Tengen Tetris.
1538155	1545880	Now, Loki, I find it ironic that you're talking about Tetris on the Sony platform, because didn't you say something to me before the show about Tetris being on the PSP?
1546000	1546561	What's this about?
1546581	1554626	Okay, well, the first game, of course, that they're going to port using that stupid Grand Theft Auto hack around, you know, is... No, wait, I don't know.
1554646	1555847	Tell me about the Grand Theft Auto hack.
1556848	1567635	Anyways, no, there's this Grand Theft Auto cheat device that was created by this guy named... I believe it's in Carter or something like that.
1569281	1575987	Long story short, it's this wonderful device that you can load all these cheats in, basically like a trainer for Grand Theft Auto.
1576327	1585135	Well, now they're using this to port Homebrew to the PSP for firmwares 2.5, 2.6, and so on.
1586616	1587937	So, actually, that's what they're doing.
1587977	1593682	The first game that's been released right now is Tetris for version 2.5.
1593742	1593962	Why, people?
1595609	1595870	DarkSakura.com
1602799	1603439	Thanks for watching!
1626309	1633295	Now, however, one of the things they have done beyond Tetris is they've released a software development kit that they're using for other homebrew over.
1633315	1638620	So you're going to see a lot more stuff coming and possibly another downgrader later on.
1640418	1641198	We'll see what happens.
1642059	1643619	All right, let's shift gears here a little bit.
1643639	1648500	You know, some folks say that Tetris is a bit of an educational game in some ways because it's a puzzle game.
1648520	1650041	You've got to think through it a little bit.
1650321	1651241	Jamie, you're making a face.
1651781	1652661	Why are you making a face?
1653641	1655762	Tetris is educational, my butt.
1655842	1657262	It's a thinking game.
1657322	1659743	It's the kind of game that your teachers don't get mad you're playing.
1659763	1661643	Tetris is a game of instinct.
1661843	1662404	Uh-uh.
1662604	1666625	You get up to, like, I would play Tetris from, like, 1 to 18 to 24.
1669148	1670629	Dr. Mario is the same damn way.
1671410	1674713	It's thinking fast in instinct.
1674793	1678676	It's speed thoughts, speed practice.
1679296	1687443	When I was in junior high school, we used to sometimes, because we were such nerds, we would break in our science teacher's classroom and play on the computers.
1687723	1692647	And the only times that we would get our teacher in on it is when we were playing Tetris or Scorched Earth.
1694406	1707848	You know, I had, when I was in the writing class I had to take in college, we actually had those old Macs, like the, not the 2Es, but you know what I mean, the old box crap ones.
1708789	1716710	And my friend installed Tetris on hers during class, and I was playing Doom in black and white on a Mac.
1718430	1718751	All right.
1718771	1719111	Anyway.
1719791	1720771	Back to education.
1720891	1721091	Yes.
1722003	1726048	Well, there's a little article up on 1up.com called You Can't Be Serious.
1727009	1730433	Five famous designers rehabilitate the world's most boring games.
1730514	1736661	But I thought, wouldn't it be more interesting since we are actually more celebrity than those losers?
1737903	1738043	Wow.
1739466	1741247	Wow, I see the hate mail coming in already.
1741267	1742368	No, no, no, no, no, I'm joking.
1742388	1743769	I have friends over there, be careful.
1744029	1750213	There's some pretty cool people involved in that, like they got some of the folks who worked on Ratchet and Clank and different people.
1750533	1751894	But I think we should do our take on it.
1752461	1753502	Okay, give me an example.
1753762	1755343	First game, Virtual Leader.
1756563	1765589	It works as a staff meeting without donuts, but it teaches managers how to, I like this, I'm going to quote this, how to squash the hopes and dreams of worker bees.
1766069	1768110	But actually you learn how to keep them productive.
1768250	1771132	I like the comparison, the Sims meets Office Space.
1773553	1778276	So in the sense that what this article has is it's got famous game designers saying this is an edutainment game there ought to be.
1778396	1779817	This is how we would remake it.
1780745	1782206	I think there should be, because you know what?
1782246	1784588	High school isn't just about learning, like book learning.
1784628	1785929	It's about social learning, too.
1786490	1791293	So I think there should be a game called Murder the Bully.
1791934	1792594	No, I'm just teasing.
1792614	1793255	Don't do that, kids.
1793295	1793695	Please don't.
1794275	1796417	Well, it says in here, to rehabilitate.
1796437	1801821	This one, this is by Ted Price, who's the president of Insomniac, who did Wretched and Clank.
1803242	1807405	Said, first of all, the employees in the games would be armed, concealed or visible...
1808188	1813734	and then have full body armor and you can shoot your boss for yelling at you, I think.
1813794	1815656	Each employee should have a unique psychosis.
1816838	1817739	I think that would be cool.
1818620	1825988	But my take on that would be you would have your mole employee who's actually working for another company working on a hostile takeover.
1826548	1827810	And by hostile, I mean bazookas.
1829382	1831484	I got a great game based on an earlier job I had.
1831524	1832124	This is my game.
1832144	1833085	This is my invention of a game.
1833945	1836587	It's called Data Entry Monkey, the game.
1838789	1844133	And what you have to do is you have to turn on your... Let's say it's for Xbox because Xboxes have a clock in it.
1844153	1844453	I know that.
1844773	1851598	So let's say that you turn on your Xbox and you have to be in by 8 o'clock or the Xbox yells at you and threatens to fire you, okay?
1851979	1863808	And then what happens is that a sequence of like up, down, left, right, and A, B, Y, X come up on the screen and you have to punch them in with 98% accuracy for 8 freaking hours with 30 minute lunch and two 15 minute breaks.
1864429	1866870	And then when it's done, that's it.
1866931	1867391	End of game.
1867451	1871254	And it prepares you for your first office job of data entry monkey.
1871857	1876842	There actually is a Yahoo game where you serve customers and take orders and stuff.
1876862	1877822	Like Root Beer Tapper?
1878183	1880365	I've seen, I've watched Iguana Girl playing this.
1880745	1882767	She's amazingly good at it.
1884546	1895751	Um, but, uh, the next game come up is called A Force More Powerful, which is a pacifist game, it's an anti-war game, where you have military situations come up and you have to find a non-violent solution to them.
1896531	1901033	Um, that right away just sounds really boring, because, you know, the whole world just wants to blow the crap out of each other.
1901974	1911398	So, um, there's a, they talk in here about having, uh, the, uh, uh, it's by, uh,
1912806	1916588	The manager who oversaw Perfect Dark Zero, which I find this hilarious.
1917248	1921309	I'm curious what you guys in chat, who are listening to us live, what do you guys think in chat room now?
1921329	1923610	I want to hear some good ideas.
1924450	1927992	www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com It's the first show, people.
1928512	1929852	Click on Interact With Us.
1930833	1931633	It's not the first show.
1931653	1932293	This is number 170.
1932353	1935575	Yeah, but I keep blaming it on the first show thing.
1937425	1942589	Is it like doing a country simulator with intelligent AIs that you have to convince them?
1942869	1944090	I think the game's already been done.
1945051	1947152	Isn't that like ActRaiser or some shit?
1948433	1949434	Maybe, I'm not sure.
1950334	1956559	The way I would do that is I would not make a game out of that.
1956699	1958040	I would actually do it in real life.
1960076	1962578	Go outside the game.
1963438	1963838	Exactly.
1963918	1965019	Go outside the game.
1965099	1967661	Be active in real life and stop pretending.
1968521	1970582	But I don't think that would be a very good game at all.
1971103	1972944	We have some feedback in the chat room from Tomo Kun.
1972964	1978807	There was a game at the McDonald's website where you went through a day at work just clicking over and over and producing Big Macs.
1979067	1980448	I saw that a couple years ago.
1981764	1986346	Yeah, but does the game shoot hot grease at you so you can really get the full experience of what it's like?
1986446	1987007	I don't think so.
1987147	1987947	It glamorizes it.
1987967	1994631	Does it not, you know, penalize you for making really bad burgers or messing up completely?
1994911	1995871	Oh, I forgot the patty.
1995891	1996391	That's okay.
1997032	1997432	Close enough.
1998416	2000057	Another game on here is called Virtual You.
2001257	2002917	And I'll just go ahead and read this.
2003518	2015541	Basically, you have to either keep your professors happy and keep the football team off steroids and keep the frat boy issues from happening, like hazing and stuff.
2016282	2019002	So you are being a university administrator.
2020123	2022123	Teaching you the administrative process.
2024424	2026645	If they wanted that to be really realistic, though, the
2027651	2035219	Educators would have to be on both some type of coffee and then lots of booze and be highly alcoholic and have an ulcer.
2036941	2041225	They should actually have school administrator health.
2041909	2042449	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2071417	2073398	You have died of dysentery Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?
2100639	2102220	A Number Munchers was the one I remember.
2102460	2103100	Remember Number Munchers?
2103120	2104060	Mario was missing.
2105460	2107601	Remember how people thought that was actually a Mario game?
2108181	2109141	I rented it one time.
2109181	2110262	It had really good music.
2110502	2111382	I have the MP3s.
2111562	2120164	Well, you know what the one good thing about that game was, though, is that it was basically all of the Super Nintendo graphics on a Nintendo from Mario World.
2120764	2121224	I remember that.
2121244	2122785	And it looked really good.
2122885	2125525	I was like, they put this effort into this game?
2125625	2126306	Excuse me?
2126806	2127366	I remember that.
2127466	2127906	I remember that.
2128775	2129055	All right.
2129335	2130256	Well, moving on.
2130316	2131897	Oh, actually, another educational game.
2131917	2132238	Sure, what?
2132298	2132758	Ridge Racer.
2133979	2134799	How's that educational?
2134819	2135520	It taught me how to drive.
2137722	2138442	I'm serious!
2139503	2145387	That's like how my mom said everything I needed to learn about the birds and the bees, so to speak, I learned from Married With Children.
2147108	2147429	Forget it.
2149390	2155835	Now, Jamie, you have a follow-up story here about teachers in the UK supporting games in education.
2157451	2157791	Right.
2158532	2163796	Actually, there's a project called Teaching with Games.
2164056	2175085	EA and Nesta Future Labs revealed that 60% of UK educators are supporting using video games in education.
2176132	2191594	There's a survey that was conducted in November that covered 1,000 primary and secondary school teachers in the UK, and of the 59% who considered using games in education, 53% confirmed they would do so because they are an interactive way of motivating and engaging pupils.
2194096	2199878	91% believed that playing the games could develop children's motor cognitive skills.
2200279	2206421	Over 60% thought that players would develop their higher order thinking and would also acquire topic-specific knowledge.
2206822	2213625	Now, I actually, about two months ago, brought up an article I read in one of the psychology journals that I...
2214245	2233663	occasionally read because I'm a nerd, that was talking about how they actually did full lab study tests with control groups to pit the cognitive function of gamers versus non-gamers and that the gamers came up higher in almost anything having to do with a reactive cognitive type of activity.
2233983	2239228	So in other words, when we tell our parents that we're working on our hand-eye coordination, we ain't shitting you.
2239668	2240369	It's actually true.
2241732	2249578	I mean, because the thing is, especially since there are so many different types of games, you have your puzzle games that basically are teaching you spatial relations right then and there.
2249618	2250438	Tetris, okay?
2250558	2251199	Back to Tetris.
2251779	2258043	You have your games that are teaching you how to basically come to a conclusion, the logic process.
2258984	2261186	You know, you have your games that are teaching you...
2262495	2275159	basically how a sport will go or teaching you how to play a game you understand more of the mechanics behind some of these things especially with as interactive as sports games are becoming you really have to know quite a bit
2277321	2290026	I think it's actually really terrific and I wish that instead of our nemesis Mr. Thompson going around saying that games are teaching people how to kill, we're so... What was the word this week?
2290126	2292307	Masturbatory exercise or something?
2293367	2296388	I'm trying not to be foul-mouthed in this episode.
2296448	2298589	Yeah, don't get us that explicit tag on iTunes, please.
2298669	2298909	But...
2303483	2303803	All right.
2305164	2307326	No, I take that back because no one would want to.
2307386	2308007	They'd be afraid.
2308167	2309088	All right.
2309108	2309848	Don't get us sued.
2309928	2310469	Don't get us sued.
2310849	2311109	All right.
2311149	2311730	No, no, no.
2311750	2312410	Okay.
2312470	2313271	Back to the good stuff.
2313311	2313912	Back to the good stuff.
2314552	2324541	I do, though, think that a lot of these people who naysay games so much are overlooking the amount of good that there is and all that, you know?
2325586	2326247	I agree, I agree.
2326527	2331353	Do you think it's realistic that someday in PE class we could have video games that supplement the games we're about to play?
2331373	2334176	Schools in Southern California have DDR as part of their gym program.
2335117	2339302	Do you think before we go out and play football for real, maybe learn a little bit about the strategy in Madden?
2340103	2340484	Possibly?
2340764	2344588	You have to decide your plays, but that's been there since Tecmo Bowl.
2345630	2345770	True.
2346610	2348972	Alright, let's change gears here a little bit.
2349012	2350533	Very interesting discussion there on education.
2350853	2356498	If you all ever have any feedback, to go at OrangeLaunchRadio.com is the place to send us some emails.
2356518	2358500	And we'll get to the mailbag a little bit later in the show.
2358540	2362463	But first, we got the Duke from Freeze Pop waiting, so we want to get to him.
2362543	2363744	But we got a couple stories first.
2363804	2368528	So, Loki, what's going on with DirecTV on the Xbox 360?
2368828	2374052	Well, the 360, of course, they wanted to be the entertainment console for you.
2374597	2377099	and basically all encompassing and everything.
2377319	2379840	Which I think everybody wants in this next gen of game.
2380661	2382562	Want some for $400, seriously.
2383362	2397051	But what they're doing right now, DirecTV has actually announced that they are planning to bring their service to digital televisions via PCs and the Xbox 360 system.
2397791	2403415	This will basically make it a lot easier to turn PCs and DVRs as well as, you know,
2404005	2407488	Making the Xbox 360 awesome.
2408289	2410010	Because now we can record TV to it.
2410991	2413853	How this is going to be implemented, I don't know, but sounds cool.
2414314	2414854	I'm all for it.
2415194	2416115	It's interesting.
2416976	2417796	Okay, why not?
2417957	2418257	Why not?
2418417	2419798	I mean, you've got a hard drive in there.
2419858	2421219	Granted, it's not big, but, you know.
2422520	2428645	I guess anything to reach out to get that Xbox 360 to be the centerpiece in your living room was a good idea for Microsoft, right?
2428665	2432789	I guess, I mean, it's great that they're adding all this extra functionality to it.
2432889	2432969	Um,
2433834	2435776	Just when are they going to start making better games?
2451830	2456535	Judgment Day is the one with Tommy Tallarico and Victor Lucas, right?
2456575	2459758	Doing the little, like, you know, I like this game and I don't like this game.
2459778	2466304	Well, the thing is, and I'm not sure, I'm guessing just G4 cancelled it because it's one of the shows... Well, because they don't like gaming anymore.
2466324	2467365	Yeah, exactly.
2467445	2473110	But one of the things is, basically the show will still kind of exist in this...
2474056	2475478	It's an ongoing show they have.
2475498	2479341	They do three shows, Electric Playground, Reviews on the Run, and then Judgment Day.
2479381	2484907	Judgment Day being gone, but Reviews on the Run is kind of very similar to Judgment Day anyway.
2485087	2487709	So, you know, it's not really gone.
2488190	2490812	Of course, Reviews on the Run you're not going to see if you're in the United States.
2490933	2493495	They don't play it in the United States on G4 or anything like that.
2494136	2497559	I'm surprised these guys haven't gotten into the world of video podcasting yet with their stuff.
2498126	2503788	I'm not sure if... I mean, they're still doing Electric Playground, so... Take X-Play on, head-to-head.
2503948	2505828	Although I prefer X-Play personally.
2505848	2509670	Electric Playground's still an okay show, but you know what?
2509690	2509990	You know what?
2510010	2511310	They canceled one show.
2511450	2519533	It's so easy to cancel another one, so... You know, I'm sure they'll just replace it with reruns of Thunder in Paradise or something like that.
2520453	2521453	I'm going to be nice.
2521654	2522494	I'm going to be nice.
2523695	2537511	Coming to G4 TV, Paradise Hotel Because I guarantee you I have some pretty choice things to say about G4 So I'm going to be nice and not say it If you can't say something nice, then shut up There you go Alright, anyway
2539272	2539993	Orange Lounge Radio
2557188	2576526	Demanded more Freeze Pop Thanks to a relationship with the gaming group Harmonix Freeze Pop continued to rock us with songs in Amplitude, Karaoke Revolution And now, recently crossed over into mainstream hits Such as Dance Dance Revolution and Guitar Hero Now, Jamie, I know you are the queen of Orange Lounge Radio But what do you think?
2576687	2578568	Should we invite some other royalty here on the show?
2579189	2581511	Sure Like the Duke from the band Freeze Pop?
2581852	2582032	Cool
2583484	2587388	All right, please help me welcome to Orange Lounge Radio, The Duke from Freeze Pop.
2587428	2588049	How you doing?
2588569	2588890	Great.
2588930	2590291	How's everybody out there doing?
2590992	2591612	Pretty good.
2591672	2595376	We're pretty excited here because we're having our brand new format tonight.
2595396	2596978	It's a pretty big week for us.
2598459	2598800	Great.
2599260	2602343	Now, I know you've been kind of doing a little bit of touring with Freeze Pop lately.
2602443	2605326	You guys were at the GAME Festival in San Francisco.
2605406	2605867	How'd that go?
2607008	2607849	That was pretty fun.
2608529	2625682	We were out there just because a game developers conference was happening at that same time and so there's a bunch of video game related events out there and we wanted to play a show and we also played at the Gang Awards which is the Game Audio Network Guild and at the game event at the Metreon.
2625722	2626423	It was a lot of fun.
2626883	2627183	Awesome.
2627203	2629645	So it sounds like you guys do a lot of video game related events.
2629725	2630406	Anything coming up?
2632557	2635098	Actually, nothing really tied to that.
2635778	2644682	More just like little one-off shows and weekends here in the U.S., and then we're going back over to England in April for a weekend worth of shows, so that should be fun.
2645002	2649344	Now, if people want to check out your upcoming tour dates, they can always visit your website or your MySpace, right?
2650284	2650984	Yeah, definitely.
2651084	2658227	Our website is usually the most up-to-date, and that's just freezepop.com, so that's right there on our news page.
2658718	2658998	Awesome.
2659038	2678973	Now, you kind of mentioned there that you do a lot of work with these video game award shows and stuff, and of course, I think the way most people know about you guys is that your long-standing working relationship with Harmonix, because seeing a synth band in Guitar Hero was a bit of a surprise, but not to anyone that played Amplitude or Frequency or any of those games.
2679274	2681475	How did your relationship with Harmonix begin?
2684761	2688222	Well, do you want the real truth or do you want the kind of like fake story?
2688402	2689843	We want the real deal here.
2690763	2692163	Well, the real deal is I work there.
2693144	2693924	Wow, okay.
2694484	2694784	Okay.
2695865	2698506	So what's the fake story, just out of curiosity?
2700006	2701126	I don't work there.
2702207	2702807	Okay, okay.
2703167	2711510	Well, now, so because you are working at Harmonix, Freeze Pop's not the only name you've done contributions under, right?
2712549	2713189	No, that's true.
2713689	2730273	For both frequency and amplitude, I was initially hired there basically just as an audio authoring person, songwriter, and we knew that we weren't going to be able to get enough artists for the game to especially fill out a bunch of sub-genres that we really wanted to have in the game.
2731233	2738695	And so my job was basically to kind of come up with all the different songs that kind of covered the genres we didn't have, like synth-pop, drum and bass,
2739452	2743836	Electro, Techno, Trance, those kind of genres.
2743876	2748180	So I wrote a lot of music under some fake names for those different genres of music.
2748660	2752143	But it ended up working out really well because Freeze Pop's kind of taken off, right?
2753424	2756507	Freeze Pop has gotten a lot of fans from video games.
2756907	2762512	There's no denying that we basically reached a whole group of people that probably would never have heard of us.
2763126	2764047	If not through the games.
2786431	2789114	Yeah, actually, it was kind of a fun opportunity.
2791096	2805453	I had been trying to get some free spot music into a DDR game for a while, and Harmonix has a long-standing relationship with Konami because we've made the Karaoke Revolution games for them, which there are now four of them out there.
2806778	2813045	I think we actually had one of our, I think Science Genius Girls saw a Freeze Pop song was in the first Karaoke Revolution.
2813105	2813726	I remember that.
2813786	2819472	So how did this relationship with Karaoke Revolution turn into being a part of Ultramix 3?
2820714	2823597	Well, it was basically like any industry.
2823717	2825419	It's based on who you know.
2826636	2853100	The people who kind of like helped the karaoke revolution thing finally got, you know, helped me get in contact with the right people at Tenami and I got some music to them and started talking to them and they were excited about either putting an exclusive Freeze Pop song or a remix or we just, we couldn't figure out like what relationship or like kind of like how we were going to like spin things and so we kind of agreed that they really liked the song Stakeout and I kind of wanted to get them something exclusive that, you know, nobody else had.
2853951	2856353	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2890805	2893575	I'm thinking we'll do something more, I hide behind my magazines
2921863	2922586	Thank you for watching!
2981496	2986580	Alright, now the video for Stakeout, the Ultra Mix, is kind of very interesting as well.
2986620	2988402	It's kind of like a Flash animation video.
2988682	2990183	How did the video come about for that song?
2991204	3003515	That was actually done by our singer, Liz Enthusiasm, whose alter ego is actually as a web designer and animator and kind of like an all-around design guru.
3004275	3009980	And she, a couple years ago, you know, when Flash started to become really popular, just wanted to check it out and
3010492	3021497	I think she felt a good way to kind of get into using the program was to make some videos for us, so she made a video for our song Freeze Pop Forever, and then she also made the Stakeout video for us.
3022177	3025778	Awesome, well the video turned out really well, so pass on our compliments to her, it's great.
3026258	3029840	Yeah, it's pretty fun to have kind of like an animated cartoon
3031003	3035507	I bet it's kind of surreal to see that, but that's great.
3036848	3041352	Now, is staying in touch with a video game and gamer scene important to you guys as a band?
3041892	3046456	As Freeze Pop continues to get bigger and bigger, are you still going to be contributing to video game projects?
3048177	3049178	Oh, I sure hope so.
3050439	3053401	I'd love to stay as close to that community as possible.
3054222	3057425	The kids are really fun, and it's such a wide group.
3057665	3058826	It's not just 14-year-old boys.
3058846	3058966	We get
3060680	3068625	People come into our concert, and instead of bringing CDs to sign, they'll bring copies of Amplitude, or maybe they'll bring copies of Guitar Hero now.
3069686	3077891	We played a show in Portland last fall, and this guy brought his PlayStation 2 and had us autograph his PlayStation 2, which was kind of surreal.
3078051	3078632	That's awesome.
3079472	3083995	Yeah, I hope we get to play a lot of shows that kind of appeal to the gaming community.
3085096	3090099	There's a bunch of other bands out there that are also kind of video game related, like 8-Bit Weapon.
3090951	3104322	and it's really fun to play with them and kind of just, you know, our fans who are more of like, got into us musically then find out that they can play some video games and the video game people then find out we have like CDs and play shows and
3105175	3106796	It's definitely a lot of fun all around.
3107117	3108398	That would be pretty amazing.
3108458	3110339	It might be a little bit of a logistical problem.
3110359	3113141	All of us bands are pretty up-and-coming and very DIY.
3127807	3133792	We don't have labels, we don't have managers, we don't have booking agents, so we kind of do it ourselves.
3134292	3142478	It's sometimes a little bit of a logistical problem to get everybody to all show up in the same cities all at once, but it certainly would be fun.
3142658	3143919	That's true too.
3144200	3148243	A lot of you guys probably have day jobs like we do here at Orange Launch Radio too.
3149323	3153306	That sometimes gets in the way of being fabulous international rock stars.
3153487	3153887	Yeah.
3154688	3165616	Alright, now, we've actually heard, because we do a lot of coverage of music-centric video games here on Orange Lounge, we heard of you guys being involved with a new dance game called Neon FM.
3165856	3167677	What are you guys exactly contributing to this project?
3168077	3168858	Just some music, or...?
3169867	3174788	Well, that's kind of confusing, and I don't know how much I should comment on it.
3174888	3180089	I'm friends with the two guys, the two Erics, who kind of have set the game up.
3180790	3184110	And honestly, I don't even know what the status of the game is right now.
3184410	3187771	Neither do we.
3188271	3189232	I said neither do we.
3189272	3190552	That's why I thought I'd ask.
3191294	3197321	Yeah, you know, every now and then I talk to him, and we actually got a chance to meet them finally.
3197361	3202367	They drove up to see a show in Pittsburgh last fall, so we got a chance to hang out with them.
3202407	3202948	It was really cool.
3203709	3210796	and I know they've had some ups and downs with the games and it would be really great for the games to come out but honestly I actually don't know a whole lot of information about it.
3211536	3228432	We were slated to put a couple songs in the games and then we pulled one out but we were going to write an exclusive song for the game and I guess we're just kind of waiting to hear if it actually comes out but we would love to contribute songs to it because letting people dance to our music is always like
3228872	3237716	Yeah, and it would be great to just see a new dance game come out in the arcades, too, something to kind of, you know, bring some energy back to the arcades, because the arcade scene's been lacking.
3237736	3238376	Yeah, totally.
3239076	3254963	Oh, yeah, I mean, the more people that come out with, like, awesome rhythm action games and dance games and music games, just, you know, it infuses a whole new energy, and you get to see how other game companies approach, you know, dealing with the subject matter, what music they choose, and all that kind of thing, and
3255529	3259434	It's definitely good to have lots of people kind of got their fingers into the mix and stuff.
3259494	3263400	So it'll be really exciting to see them get that game out there in the arcades.
3263760	3264321	Absolutely.
3264721	3267705	Are there any other upcoming projects that you can speak about, possibly?
3268946	3272708	I mean, we're definitely, Harmonix is definitely working on some new game ideas.
3273268	3274768	Of course, I can't really talk about them.
3275609	3288454	I mean, of course, we've got some, like, amazing bugs coming off of the Guitar Hero game, and it was, you know, it was really, actually pretty exciting to get a Freeze Pop song on there, considering that we don't actually have any real instruments in our band at all.
3290175	3293796	But, yeah, I mean, we're working on some interesting games, and I think, you know,
3294204	3297267	I think there might be some surprises in the future with what we come up with.
3297827	3298828	You bring up a good point though.
3298868	3304613	How did you manage to get a song in Guitar Hero when you guys don't really use guitars in a lot of your music?
3304653	3308116	Did you write a song specifically with guitars in mind or how did that work?
3309102	3317924	No, fortunately, we actually had a song that was all about rocking, even though we don't really rock, because we have no drummers or guitar players or anything like that.
3318004	3321045	You can still rock without guitars and drums, I think.
3321085	3335008	Yeah, and it was the song off our first album, and it was kind of funny, because there's kind of a rip-off of Iron Man at the end of the song, and so when the game kind of got underway, and they were figuring out how to deal with all the unlock songs,
3335965	3340169	and they were really supportive about going to a bunch of local Boston bands.
3341370	3350898	A bunch of different Harmonix employees all put songs in the game and so I think the president of Harmonix came by and he was like, you've got to be able to put a song in the game.
3351238	3355860	Even if you have no guitar in it at all, I think it would be super funny to have you guys in the game.
3356440	3357460	And I kind of thought about it.
3357520	3361922	I knew which song I wanted to put in, because it had to be a song about, you know, rocking out.
3362882	3370585	But I was kind of debating for a long time whether or not there should be guitar or no guitar, and would it be funnier to play a synthesizer part on the guitar?
3371425	3375147	But ultimately I went with putting a guitar part on there, and I had...
3376327	3394612	A longtime friend, Izzy Maxwell, who has actually done some remixes for Freeze Pop, and he's a really shredding guitar player, and so I kind of said, Izzy, I need you to record a screaming metal guitar part over this, and he kind of just went to town, and I think he created actually a really fun guitar part to play in the game.
3395527	3395908	Awesome.
3395988	3402334	Well, I'm kind of wondering, you know, obviously Guitar Hero, lots and lots of people are buying this game.
3402375	3404797	It's doing very well and critically it's doing well.
3405218	3409903	I think it's a given that there's got to be a sequel in the works, whether you can say anything about it or not.
3410503	3412846	Do you think Freeze Pop will be involved with the sequel as well?
3413852	3417933	Oh man, if there's a sequel, we've got to come up with... The thing is, we don't even have a song we could use.
3417973	3421814	We may have to write a sequel song to get ready to rock.
3421874	3425174	Maybe it's like, we got ready, but now we're rocking.
3425194	3427915	Or something like that.
3428535	3437457	Not sure what's going to happen, but man, it's always exciting to see if the game is appropriate for putting one of our songs on there, even if it's kind of a stretch.
3438595	3450585	There were some reviews for Guitar Hero with people who were really surprised that we got a song on there and kind of almost gave the game extra kudos for kind of going out on a limb and putting almost an inappropriate song into a guitar game.
3450905	3464275	Well, you know, it worked out beautifully, and I think it pleases the fans, the longtime fans of Freeze Pop via Harmonix, and I think the folks who were playing Guitar Hero and had never heard of you guys probably had a chance to rock out to the song as well.
3464476	3466197	Yeah, I mean, we're already starting...
3466517	3473188	We're already starting to get some emails from some fans who are like, I never heard of you guys and I saw you in the game.
3473248	3480880	Then you go to your website and they figure out who you are and they decide whether or not you think you're a complete idiot or they like your music.
3481881	3485402	and we get our little share of hate mail, which is kind of interesting.
3485462	3486082	It's kind of fun.
3487222	3494644	It's exciting to know that you've impacted somebody, whether or not you totally rocked their world or you made them completely hate you.
3494924	3496665	At least you made an impression on them.
3496965	3497325	Exactly.
3497365	3500126	We get the hate mail, too, here at Orange Lounge once in a while.
3500266	3507508	It's kind of interesting to think that, wow, what you did motivated somebody to sit down and actually write out, Dear Orange Lounger, I hate you.
3510021	3511402	Wow, well at least he bought the CD.
3538668	3539509	That's what I said.
3539589	3541050	At least he bought a CD.
3541110	3544733	I was excited because he created a piece of art himself.
3545613	3554600	Every now and then when we get a new piece of anti-freeze pop email, I forward them that email and ask them to maybe try a little bit harder next time.
3554620	3560865	Of course, that doesn't make them super happy either, but you know what can you do.
3560985	3563267	I have to ask all of our guests on the show this question.
3563547	3567610	What are some of your favorite games to play outside of these music games we've been talking about earlier?
3569028	3572450	Well, I'm definitely an old-school person.
3572490	3576953	I mean, old 8-bit Atari 2600 games are still, like, my favorite.
3577973	3585037	You know, the thing about games where you have to invest incredible amounts of time to beat the game is a little bit frustrating to me.
3586058	3593102	My interaction with games is definitely more of kind of a transitional, short-time experience, and so I just like to sit down...
3593632	3601396	Play a couple of levels of something and don't feel bad when I want to, like, you know, not sit there for, like, ten hours or have to come back to it day after day.
3601836	3608059	So definitely, you know, I'm big fans of, like, Yars' Revenge and Sub Hunt and kind of old 8-bit games.
3608159	3612842	I think, you know, like, newer games, I play a lot of them just to kind of see what people do.
3613702	3620586	I worked for a race car driving video game company for a while, so I really got into, like, NASCAR games and race car games and stuff.
3620626	3620906	Wow.
3621974	3627659	which is pretty random, but I like to check those out, and we just got a 360 at Harmonix.
3627679	3631143	We've been checking out the new racing games and stuff like that.
3632124	3633365	I'm not sure.
3635026	3637729	Obviously, I'm a huge fan of the games inside the genre.
3637809	3642954	Rez was a huge game for me, and Vibribin, and...
3647621	3651063	Now that's great you've named Vib Ribbon because that game didn't even come out in this country.
3651343	3652384	And we know that game.
3652404	3653184	That's an awesome game.
3654085	3656526	Yeah, we have some Japanese PS2s.
3657026	3659508	And we're big fans of a lot of the Japanese games.
3660389	3665572	You know, the guy who came up with Vib Ribbon and, you know, Unjammer Lammy.
3665692	3667793	And those games are really super fun to play.
3668934	3670655	Guitaroman is kind of interesting.
3670675	3671656	Definitely check that out.
3671916	3673557	It's a difficult game, that's for certain.
3675036	3696191	and you know I'm a big fan of Katamari Damacy like I just those games that are kind of quirky and left of center are some of my favorite ones it sounds like we have a lot of the same tastes in games those are games we're always talking about on here so that's that's awesome cool all right so that's about all I wanted to ask you game wise but I want to give you a chance to plug any any albums or tour dates you got coming up that you want to tell our listeners about here's your chance
3697321	3697963	Well, let's see.
3698003	3699366	I mean, things are kind of quiet.
3699406	3704058	We're working on a new Freeze Pop album, and it's well underway.
3704398	3706223	We don't know when it's going to be done, but definitely...
3707486	3735828	pay attention to our website and we're playing a bunch of shows in March and April we're going to be in Ohio and Indiana and I think we're going to go up to Chicago in March and then we'll be over in England to play in London and Leeds and a couple cities over there at the end of April and definitely just pay attention to our website because we'll probably be out on the west coast as well maybe like in the fall and hopefully we'll have a new album so there you go
3736648	3742712	Awesome, alright, so Freezepop.com to stay in tune with all the latest information, what's going on with Freezepop?
3743472	3746534	Yeah, we're on MySpace too, so come and be our friend there as well.
3747014	3753858	Alright, awesome, so Kasson, aka The Duke from Freezepop, thank you so much for being on Orange Lounge Radio and spending time with us this week.
3754279	3755679	Oh, it's super fun, thanks for having me.
3755779	3756620	Alright, no problem.
3757701	3761963	That was very, very cool, especially the Vibribin mention, because I'm like, Vibribin!
3763644	3765105	Does that guy know how to rock, or what?
3765666	3767868	Freeze Pop is now my second favorite band.
3768589	3769109	Next to Gorillaz?
3769429	3770150	Next to Gorillaz.
3770450	3772912	They even have surpassed Pain.
3773273	3774794	Because we all know Pain is good.
3775414	3775955	Freeze Pop, yay.
3777256	3780158	I totally blanked and forgot to ask about Supernova.
3780359	3781900	And the chat room hates me for it, I know.
3781920	3784983	But I totally didn't even think to ask about Supernova.
3785343	3787505	But we'll talk about Supernova in the next hour.
3788185	3791188	You know, I'm glad he has a lot of...
3792238	3797001	I still don't like their music.
3798462	3799982	You can just die.
3800082	3800443	Why?
3800463	3803764	I really don't like them.
3804285	3807266	They're probably a really cool band, but nothing I've heard so far.
3807286	3809927	I don't like that type of music.
3810028	3810428	I don't know.
3810528	3812149	I'm sorry.
3812729	3813269	I just don't.
3813649	3816271	I like Freeze Pop's music the same way I like 8-Bit Weapon.
3817812	3818412	Just the whole...
3820030	3823451	Just the whole little quirky synthy vibe, and they remind me of Berlin.
3823571	3825792	He mentioned 8-Bit Weapon, so I think they're kind of buddy bands.
3826212	3828293	Yeah, I really dig 8-Bit Weapon.
3828333	3829813	You know what else I thought was interesting about that?
3830193	3832994	He said that they have an Xbox 360 at Harmonix.
3833114	3833574	Hmm.
3834715	3835175	I wonder why.
3835981	3839083	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3865499	3867020	Elite on the BBC Micro
3894138	3895679	I don't even know what the hell that is, but that's alright.
3895860	3896741	I've never played it.
3896841	3897541	I've heard of it, though.
3897581	3898382	I know the game.
3898722	3899503	I've just not played it.
3899523	3900524	Is it a game system you don't have?
3902406	3904648	I do not have a BBC Micro, and I need to have one.
3904808	3905609	It wouldn't work on our TV.
3905629	3907030	You should have to get the little adapter thing.
3907050	3908592	You know, I actually have a system.
3908692	3911054	I now have a system so old I cannot play it on my TV.
3911375	3911695	What's that?
3911795	3912255	An Odyssey 2.
3913156	3913597	Oh, yeah.
3913737	3914518	Oh, those things are old.
3914738	3915719	Yeah, my TV's like...
3918582	3920503	Why do we have to do these lists all the time?
3920543	3922084	What motivates people to make lists?
3922404	3923305	I think it's hilarious.
3923545	3924866	All right, so we can talk about this.
3924886	3925666	We can fill show time.
3925686	3926187	All right, number nine.
3926447	3932150	My number one cause of motion sickness, Goldeneye 007 on the Nintendo 64.
3933251	3936192	This was the one game that made me puke, literally.
3936433	3939474	Not because it was a bad game, because it gave me vertigo.
3940355	3947459	But it was a really awesome game, and I don't think there has been as good of a bond game since.
3948562	3949483	Goldeneye was excellent.
3950964	3952145	Number 8, Street Fighter 2.
3953566	3954786	Coming soon to Xbox Arcade.
3955927	3958629	I mean, this was the one that brought you the World Warriors.
3958669	3962071	This set the stage for 2D fighting.
3962352	3963973	For even a lot of 3D fighters.
3965053	3968015	Because, you know, we actually even have the Street Fighter EX series.
3969496	3972579	Okay, coming up for number 7, Super Mario Kart.
3974480	3974860	Good choice.
3976421	3977402	You know, and it really...
3978886	3979847	I do agree with this.
3979907	3984512	It says it seemed like the worst idea ever but quickly proved itself as the best thing ever.
3986134	3989558	That was my college dorm life was Mario Kart like every weekend.
3991160	3995264	Well, if you were in my room, it was Mario Kart because we were the nerd room.
3995284	3998027	But if you're in the room down the hall, it was smoke weed and drink.
3998768	3999529	You know what mine was?
3999689	3999849	What?
4000672	4001733	Monkey Island 2, LeChuck's Revenge
4030227	4032969	and, let's see, that was number six.
4033189	4036530	Number five, Legend of Zelda, Ocarina of Time.
4037571	4037811	Yeah.
4038971	4043974	I'm still partial to the Super Nintendo one, but I won't get into that discussion tonight because we're running long.
4044154	4047876	Because people don't like it when I say that Ocarina of Time is way overrated.
4047916	4048276	But anyway.
4049196	4050377	Lies.
4050597	4051137	Lies.
4051898	4052898	Oh, he lives.
4053098	4053638	Oh, hi, hi.
4054619	4056360	Glad you could pull yourself a Mario Kart for a minute.
4056440	4056840	Talk to us.
4057771	4058671	Actually, I do apologize.
4058691	4059792	No, that was number five.
4059812	4061712	Number four, Pro Evolution Soccer 4.
4063753	4064773	We are talking about the UK.
4065274	4065494	I know.
4066134	4067034	The real football.
4067054	4067374	Men in shorts.
4067454	4068655	It's a really good series, actually.
4069335	4069655	Yeah.
4069775	4070095	Whatever.
4070215	4070895	It's really fun.
4072196	4073956	I actually kind of want to play it.
4074057	4074757	Hey, it's Konami.
4075057	4075557	Nice plug there.
4077298	4081019	Next up, number three, Pokemon Red slash Green, whichever one of those.
4081679	4084280	I still like the Pikachu one best, but still.
4085152	4087033	I will forget that five seconds from now
4109401	4110742	Mario Kart DS Mario Kart on Super Nintendo
4137709	4139430	Super Mario Bros.
4139750	4140730	3, and Super Mario World.
4141891	4142451	But that's just me.
4142691	4143112	What do I know?
4143312	4146133	I'm just some schmo that you downloaded onto your iPod.
4146193	4150015	Number one game ever, guaranteed to piss some people off.
4150635	4151155	Namely, Loki.
4151955	4152456	Tetris!
4154176	4157638	Even better, specifically, Game Boy Tetris.
4159087	4159688	Samba de Amigo Beatmania DDR
4184029	4185950	65, and this makes me happy, Tempest 2000.
4186111	4186751	Oh, yeah.
4187031	4187832	Heck, yeah.
4187972	4188852	Oh, that's too low.
4189092	4189473	Too low.
4189613	4189913	Too low.
4189933	4190953	That needs to be, like, number three.
4191214	4191374	Yeah.
4192014	4193175	Instead of Mario 64.
4193355	4197998	And this is probably my single favorite shooting game of all time, even though I suck at it.
4198678	4199038	R-Type.
4201080	4208104	That game makes me want to do that Linkin Park song, you know, went so long and got so far, but in the end it didn't matter.
4208384	4210685	Because you can't beat that game unless you're like God.
4211326	4213427	Shall I do three shooting games I enjoy more than R-Type?
4214528	4214728	No.
4215528	4217909	And number 99 was Pong.
4219209	4220790	Number 100 was Hard Drivin'.
4221710	4226211	You know I'm surprised Pac-Man wasn't in the top 10 because every top list always has Pac-Man somewhere on it.
4226531	4227612	And rightfully so.
4227632	4229812	Pac-Man does have a severe tarnish on its name.
4230412	4231693	The Atari 2600 version.
4233013	4236734	But Hard Drivin', I had to mention it because it has significance for me.
