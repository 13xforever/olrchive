4
00:00:20,069 --> 00:00:27,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 171, the second half here for this January 22nd, 2006.

5
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:30,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty lively first half there.

6
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:33,912
[SPEAKER_08]: I just made the official donation there during the break.

7
00:00:34,032 --> 00:00:41,494
[SPEAKER_08]: I went on to the LiveJournal community thing and donated for the Flowers for Jack thing, and I left a little message, $20 from us, so that'll be lovely.

8
00:00:41,514 --> 00:00:42,974
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see what happens with that.

9
00:00:43,054 --> 00:00:46,795
[SPEAKER_08]: I just hope I didn't fund somebody's vacation in Tahiti, so that's why I didn't send more.

10
00:00:46,815 --> 00:00:47,735
[SPEAKER_08]: No one goes to Tahiti.

11
00:00:47,815 --> 00:00:48,015
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

12
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:48,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway...

13
00:00:49,562 --> 00:00:49,822
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

14
00:00:50,282 --> 00:00:52,023
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, let's get right back into the news.

15
00:00:52,063 --> 00:00:55,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we will be opening up the Skype line a little later on for those of you guys in our chat room.

16
00:00:56,105 --> 00:01:01,367
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, I think we set a new record in chat tonight for the number of people that we have watching in our chat room tonight.

17
00:01:01,407 --> 00:01:07,109
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you guys so much for making this combined show a success and making our live show really take off.

18
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:07,609
[SPEAKER_08]: We appreciate it.

19
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,271
[SPEAKER_08]: And, of course, those of you that listen on the podcast, too.

20
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:13,132
[SPEAKER_08]: We know not everybody can watch Sunday night because, you know, some of you guys are watching.

21
00:01:13,152 --> 00:01:14,352
[SPEAKER_08]: What are the big TV shows on Sunday night?

22
00:01:14,372 --> 00:01:14,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Family Guy?

23
00:01:14,812 --> 00:01:17,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of you guys are watching Family Guy and the other stuff.

24
00:01:17,594 --> 00:01:18,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't get my ideas, Emily.

25
00:01:19,384 --> 00:01:20,025
[SPEAKER_08]: I shouldn't give him ideas.

26
00:01:20,265 --> 00:01:20,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

27
00:01:20,665 --> 00:01:20,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

28
00:01:21,386 --> 00:01:21,926
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't watch Family Guy.

29
00:01:21,946 --> 00:01:22,447
[SPEAKER_08]: It sucks now.

30
00:01:23,287 --> 00:01:24,568
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not as good as the first couple seasons.

31
00:01:24,809 --> 00:01:27,931
[SPEAKER_01]: The TV is as brilliant as me and not watch TV.

32
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,235
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, this is somewhat gaming related.

33
00:01:32,395 --> 00:01:34,196
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to kind of go off on a random tangent.

34
00:01:34,216 --> 00:01:34,536
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care.

35
00:01:35,337 --> 00:01:35,918
[SPEAKER_08]: I was watching 24.

36
00:01:36,058 --> 00:01:40,681
[SPEAKER_08]: I only watched the first half because, you know, they did like this four-hour premiere thing last week.

37
00:01:41,002 --> 00:01:43,664
[SPEAKER_08]: I only watched the first half of it because that's a lot of TV.

38
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:44,905
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, hooray for DVR.

39
00:01:45,225 --> 00:01:49,988
[SPEAKER_08]: But I was thinking while I was watching it, the show is so suspenseful and very, I don't know, like Metal Gear-esque.

40
00:01:50,308 --> 00:01:53,130
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm thinking, gosh, this show would make a great video game.

41
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,931
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I was like, oh yeah, there is a video game.

42
00:01:55,231 --> 00:02:02,656
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember seeing the trailer at E3, but it's been in development for so long that I believe the story was supposed to be between seasons two and three.

43
00:02:02,816 --> 00:02:03,296
[SPEAKER_08]: That's correct.

44
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:08,979
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't want to spoil anything, but this show has a tendency to kill off characters that you really get attached to.

45
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,743
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it's very interesting that the game is possibly going to have characters that have now been killed off in the storyline.

46
00:02:14,763 --> 00:02:14,843
[SPEAKER_06]: It's

47
00:02:15,043 --> 00:02:15,544
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

48
00:02:31,593 --> 00:02:34,596
[SPEAKER_08]: but not as good as games that were out on the Commodore 64.

49
00:02:35,217 --> 00:02:45,347
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll tell you what, a lot of people say that they grew up on Atari 2600 or they grew up on Nintendo, ColecoVision, Odyssey, whatever it was, arcades.

50
00:02:45,908 --> 00:02:47,529
[SPEAKER_08]: I grew up on the Commodore 64.

51
00:02:48,571 --> 00:02:52,835
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Loki, what did you find out in Commodore 64 news, believe it or not?

52
00:02:52,935 --> 00:02:53,316
[SPEAKER_06]: C64S.com C64S.com

53
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:20,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Ghosts and Goblins, Paperboy, Bruce Lee, Boulder Dash 2, and Blue Max as the top 10 right now.

54
00:03:20,477 --> 00:03:22,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my gosh, I had Blue Max.

55
00:03:22,238 --> 00:03:23,800
[SPEAKER_08]: That's crazy.

56
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Boulder Dash, I had that game too, and of course Archon.

57
00:03:26,882 --> 00:03:27,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my gosh.

58
00:03:27,622 --> 00:03:28,583
[SPEAKER_08]: What about The Last Ninja?

59
00:03:28,663 --> 00:03:29,584
[SPEAKER_06]: That game was awesome.

60
00:03:29,604 --> 00:03:30,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Spy vs. Spy.

61
00:03:30,724 --> 00:03:32,285
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Spy vs. Spy.

62
00:03:33,226 --> 00:03:34,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Tons of Boulder Dash stuff on here.

63
00:03:35,087 --> 00:03:36,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Bomb Jack, Commando 2.

64
00:03:36,068 --> 00:03:36,729
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a huge title.

65
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:47,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Back to the Future, Outrun, Pitfall, you know a lot of games that were on Atari were on Commodore 64 but with better graphics and that's one of them.

66
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:50,677
[SPEAKER_08]: And also the one that comes to mind is H.E.R.O.

67
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,758
[SPEAKER_08]: which is a game I play a hell of a lot of on GameTap.

68
00:03:53,138 --> 00:03:59,462
[SPEAKER_08]: The graphics on Commodore 64 were way better than the ones on Atari which kind of makes me sad because they don't have the Commodore version on GameTap.

69
00:03:59,482 --> 00:04:01,003
[SPEAKER_08]: They have about 100 games on there.

70
00:04:01,183 --> 00:04:01,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

71
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you know I gotta ask, is this legal?

72
00:04:04,085 --> 00:04:04,385
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

73
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:08,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Check that out, relive your youth

74
00:04:31,386 --> 00:04:58,503
[SPEAKER_08]: of course I checked out Commodore 64 emulators and they were first the big things in the emulator scene and a lot of them were just really clunky and hard to use so I like this idea of having it much easier and kind of streamlined into the website very nice alright let's move on to a very very new game and a very very popular game in this day and age World of Warcraft I talked about it earlier in the show there's some stuff coming up for what's going on with World of Warcraft Jamie you first

75
00:04:59,329 --> 00:05:04,262
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually, they are going to be celebrating the Lunar New Year.

76
00:05:05,174 --> 00:05:08,216
[SPEAKER_01]: in World of Warcraft.

77
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:14,919
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a celebration, they're saying, as in S-A-L-E.

78
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:22,523
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be getting Sparkly and Azeroth on account of the Lunar New Year, is what it says, between January 27th and February 14th.

79
00:05:22,843 --> 00:05:24,924
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be celebrations focusing on Moonglade.

80
00:05:24,944 --> 00:05:29,126
[SPEAKER_01]: The 29th will also see celebrations in Stormwind, Thunderbluff, and Booty Bay.

81
00:05:29,687 --> 00:05:30,107
[SPEAKER_01]: Booty Bay.

82
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:43,774
[SPEAKER_01]: and while every capital will be decorated on February 13th there will be a firework show at Moonglade paralleling the Chinese Festival of Lanterns so there will be a humongous light show.

83
00:05:44,254 --> 00:05:58,142
[SPEAKER_01]: Gameplay based events going on based on Azeroth's ancestors quest for holiday items as rewards tokens that can be redeemed for rockets and fireworks and festival dumplings and

84
00:05:59,103 --> 00:06:01,368
[SPEAKER_01]: different outfits available for the Lunar Holiday.

85
00:06:01,388 --> 00:06:03,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Does Blizzard know how to throw a party or what?

86
00:06:03,573 --> 00:06:04,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously?

87
00:06:04,496 --> 00:06:05,278
[SPEAKER_08]: They do some fun events.

88
00:06:06,118 --> 00:06:29,680
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw an interesting response to this though on some message board is that they were saying that this was a kind of a way for World of Warcraft to kind of appeal to the Chinese players right now because I guess they did something I haven't really been following a lot of WoW drama but I guess maybe they did something to kind of turn the Chinese players off when they launched the games there so they're saying that this is kind of a way to show that oh we can do you know oh maybe it was because of like the the more you know um

89
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching.

90
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:32,940
[SPEAKER_08]: See you next time.

91
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:02,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Since the launch, that was less than a year ago.

92
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:08,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Bringing the total number of subscribers to the game worldwide to about 5.5 million.

93
00:07:09,034 --> 00:07:13,675
[SPEAKER_08]: This also just in World of Warcraft will soon be renaming itself to just The World.

94
00:07:15,196 --> 00:07:18,557
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a .hack joke for those of you guys that didn't get that.

95
00:07:18,957 --> 00:07:19,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I get it.

96
00:07:19,978 --> 00:07:20,538
[SPEAKER_08]: I made a joke.

97
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:28,481
[SPEAKER_08]: This is why I do a podcast out of the spare bedroom of an apartment and I don't do comedy.

98
00:07:29,762 --> 00:07:46,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, Loki, speaking of other things I can't do, one of them is playing Xbox 360, because I still have yet to find one of these little bastards, but that doesn't stop the Xbox 360 news from coming in, and holy crap, do you have a lot of it tonight, starting off with Japan?

99
00:07:46,556 --> 00:07:47,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they buying them yet?

100
00:07:47,537 --> 00:07:49,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope, not buying them in Japan.

101
00:07:49,538 --> 00:07:51,420
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, only about 7,477 systems have sold there.

102
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:51,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

103
00:07:55,908 --> 00:08:03,151
[SPEAKER_06]: and I think I mentioned last week that they're being beaten out by every other console system out there, which is pretty bad.

104
00:08:03,411 --> 00:08:04,712
[SPEAKER_06]: And as far as the U.S.

105
00:08:04,752 --> 00:08:06,753
[SPEAKER_08]: sales go... Including Gizmondo, believe it or not.

106
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:07,593
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kidding.

107
00:08:07,793 --> 00:08:08,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Including the U.S.

108
00:08:08,634 --> 00:08:14,036
[SPEAKER_06]: sales, you know, they've only sold only about 600,000, which is pretty pitiful.

109
00:08:15,817 --> 00:08:16,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

110
00:08:16,277 --> 00:08:22,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, the other thing that we have here is they were kind of going back and forth on whether they wanted a third party... Or not third party.

111
00:08:23,521 --> 00:08:24,021
[SPEAKER_06]: External...

112
00:08:24,781 --> 00:08:27,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Blu-ray or external HD DVD drive.

113
00:08:27,162 --> 00:08:34,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, of course, they're backing HD DVD 100%, whether it becomes the format of choice or not.

114
00:08:34,787 --> 00:08:36,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't there a little bit of backtracking this week?

115
00:08:36,688 --> 00:08:38,849
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like, well, we might still do a Blu-ray.

116
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:40,230
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of like, we'll wait and see.

117
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,731
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they committing or what?

118
00:08:42,071 --> 00:08:42,671
[SPEAKER_06]: They're committing.

119
00:08:42,691 --> 00:08:43,212
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

120
00:08:43,252 --> 00:08:45,533
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, we'll see.

121
00:08:45,653 --> 00:08:48,615
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of what I'm thinking, but...

122
00:08:49,847 --> 00:09:02,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, anyways, the other thing is they released a list of the top 10 online Xbox Live Arcade games that are out right now and the most downloads that they've had.

123
00:09:03,152 --> 00:09:05,853
[SPEAKER_06]: To no surprise, number one, Geometry Wars.

124
00:09:06,194 --> 00:09:09,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is the main reason why a lot of people are actually getting an Xbox 360.

125
00:09:09,275 --> 00:09:10,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Screw Call of Duty.

126
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:11,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Screw it.

127
00:09:11,516 --> 00:09:11,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Right in the ear.

128
00:09:13,288 --> 00:09:14,309
[SPEAKER_06]: All these fun, okay.

129
00:09:14,489 --> 00:09:18,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, Gauntlet, number two, the retro Gauntlet.

130
00:09:18,272 --> 00:09:20,754
[SPEAKER_06]: That surprised me, because I thought Smash TV would have been number two.

131
00:09:20,774 --> 00:09:22,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Smash TV's number three.

132
00:09:22,035 --> 00:09:22,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there you go.

133
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Bejeweled 2, number four.

134
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Zuma, number five.

135
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Bank Shop Billiards, which is number six.

136
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:35,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct me if I'm wrong, Zuma and Bejeweled, two games you can play online for free, right?

137
00:09:36,147 --> 00:09:36,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

138
00:09:36,447 --> 00:09:38,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Already, okay, just checking.

139
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:39,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Do those games offer achievements, though?

140
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Outposts Kaloki Mutant Storm Reloaded Joust

141
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:04,120
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

142
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:22,441
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

143
00:10:22,461 --> 00:10:23,322
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty much it for now.

144
00:10:23,622 --> 00:10:23,862
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

145
00:10:23,882 --> 00:10:24,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good.

146
00:10:25,003 --> 00:10:25,583
[SPEAKER_06]: What else is going on?

147
00:10:49,226 --> 00:10:51,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, they're getting more units in each week.

148
00:10:51,547 --> 00:10:59,772
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, they're surprised, you know, it's taking so long and they're thinking that the, you know, pre-orders will still be there until, like, February.

149
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:03,814
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm wondering how many of them are getting cancelled because people are finding them through other means.

150
00:11:03,854 --> 00:11:07,916
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of people cancelling them, but even still, that's not really affecting anything.

151
00:11:08,596 --> 00:11:12,758
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing is there's going to be a major update to Xbox Live, or through Xbox Live.

152
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:17,921
[SPEAKER_06]: The main feature that's going to be added to it is a webcam feature, which, you know,

153
00:11:18,268 --> 00:11:19,289
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

154
00:11:46,923 --> 00:11:47,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I don't know, Loki.

155
00:11:47,743 --> 00:11:47,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Halo?

156
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:09,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Halo and Halo 2

157
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:27,449
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're expecting more games to be added, like Microsoft said, they're going to be adding more and more each week.

158
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,470
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, again, they're taking a vacation.

159
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:34,452
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not going to see any more updates to the backwards compatibility until about March or April.

160
00:12:34,492 --> 00:12:38,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully they're taking a vacation down into the factory to build some more Xbox 360s.

161
00:12:39,973 --> 00:12:40,354
[SPEAKER_06]: It's sad.

162
00:12:40,374 --> 00:12:45,995
[SPEAKER_06]: They've only had two updates to the whole backwards compatibility thing since launch.

163
00:12:46,776 --> 00:12:47,896
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't it going to be a weekly thing?

164
00:12:48,536 --> 00:12:51,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Microsoft, learning to disappoint.

165
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:53,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Learning?

166
00:12:53,961 --> 00:12:54,822
[SPEAKER_01]: You mean they didn't already know?

167
00:12:55,182 --> 00:12:56,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they're perfecting disappointment.

168
00:12:56,702 --> 00:12:56,982
[SPEAKER_01]: I see.

169
00:12:57,622 --> 00:12:58,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Some comments from the chatroom.

170
00:12:58,823 --> 00:13:01,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Wonderdog Harold says, Don't forget that Barbie game is backwards compatible.

171
00:13:01,984 --> 00:13:02,564
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm sorry.

172
00:13:02,584 --> 00:13:03,424
[SPEAKER_08]: All the kids want to play that.

173
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:05,945
[SPEAKER_08]: Rini has a response to the webcam thing.

174
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:07,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Hooray for webcams.

175
00:13:07,465 --> 00:13:09,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see people's asses and peni.

176
00:13:10,046 --> 00:13:13,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Which I think is the plural term for, you know, wang.

177
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:13,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

178
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:42,938

[SPEAKER_08]: And now for something completely different.

180
00:13:46,656 --> 00:13:53,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Another way you can interact with our show is not just through chat, not just through Skype, but there's the old email.

181
00:13:53,781 --> 00:14:03,629
[SPEAKER_08]: And you send us an email to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and Jamie, she looks in there in the cavernous mailbag and pulls out a few of her favorite emails.

182
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,531
[SPEAKER_08]: What'd you find for us this week?

183
00:14:06,831 --> 00:14:11,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we get so many, I have to really be... I try to reply to as many as possible.

184
00:14:11,575 --> 00:14:13,076
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it used to be I could reply to everybody.

185
00:14:14,685 --> 00:14:41,322
[SPEAKER_01]: We's loved Thank you, you guys are awesome, thank you Anyway, we actually, and I wanted to go ahead and give them a shout out Gorilla at 3guys3beers.com They do a podcast Actually wrote in, supporting the Mac Oh, not this again Yes, this again Oh boy I'm going to just read a little bit of this, if I may

186
00:14:42,153 --> 00:14:43,334
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that all I wanted to say?

187
00:14:43,534 --> 00:14:44,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, suit up.

188
00:14:44,314 --> 00:14:45,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Abestos.

189
00:14:45,774 --> 00:14:47,055
[SPEAKER_08]: I know they're gunning for you here.

190
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:48,676
[SPEAKER_08]: All the Mac fans are.

191
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:50,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

192
00:14:50,897 --> 00:14:51,757
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just my opinion.

193
00:14:51,917 --> 00:14:53,838
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't... Let her speak.

194
00:14:53,858 --> 00:14:54,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

195
00:14:54,758 --> 00:14:55,759
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like this quote here.

196
00:14:55,779 --> 00:15:00,320
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, Well, if I drive a dump truck at work, does that mean I have to drive one for my own personal car?

197
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:02,661
[SPEAKER_01]: In reference to the PC.

198
00:15:03,082 --> 00:15:03,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

199
00:15:05,182 --> 00:15:06,683
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it says, Windows has...

200
00:15:08,843 --> 00:15:09,684
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to read this one here.

201
00:15:09,724 --> 00:15:12,467
[SPEAKER_01]: So if someone is all about games, yeah, Windows has many more.

202
00:15:12,487 --> 00:15:17,292
[SPEAKER_01]: If someone is about music, podcasting, graphics, internet, pictures, making personal DVDs, movies, Mac is the way to go.

203
00:15:18,313 --> 00:15:21,397
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, I have to agree, I can't wait until I get my Intel iMac.

204
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:32,069
[SPEAKER_01]: He also says he can do a Mac with OSX, what he does on his PC, and you can actually customize how your Mac works, so I fully agree with that.

205
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:38,153
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, just to read the last full paragraph in here, it's like, well, I've said enough once again.

206
00:15:38,213 --> 00:15:38,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Great show.

207
00:15:38,694 --> 00:15:39,134
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it up.

208
00:15:39,494 --> 00:15:40,035
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.

209
00:15:40,495 --> 00:15:42,056
[SPEAKER_01]: Just don't talk trash about Macs, Loki.

210
00:15:43,137 --> 00:15:44,478
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk about jumping to the past.

211
00:15:44,498 --> 00:15:46,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Windows looks just as shitty as it did back in the early 90s.

212
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,881
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't polish a turd.

213
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:50,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Rebuttal?

214
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,292
[SPEAKER_06]: How many PCs out there are running Windows?

215
00:15:54,332 --> 00:15:57,555
[SPEAKER_06]: How many are running Mac OS X?

216
00:15:58,216 --> 00:15:58,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think so.

217
00:15:59,357 --> 00:16:01,459
[SPEAKER_06]: And all those features that a Mac can do.

218
00:16:01,859 --> 00:16:03,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, a PC can do just as well, if not better.

219
00:16:04,742 --> 00:16:05,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

220
00:16:05,623 --> 00:16:06,304
[SPEAKER_06]: It's my opinion.

221
00:16:06,324 --> 00:16:06,984
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.

222
00:16:07,024 --> 00:16:08,606
[SPEAKER_06]: You can go ahead and bitch and moan about it.

223
00:16:09,006 --> 00:16:12,450
[SPEAKER_06]: I will never buy Mac products ever, and this includes iPods.

224
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:15,773
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering how actual numbers is opinion.

225
00:16:15,993 --> 00:16:16,834
[SPEAKER_01]: Actual numbers are facts.

226
00:16:17,154 --> 00:16:21,176
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I went into the mailbag earlier this week and I was looking at random emails.

227
00:16:21,196 --> 00:16:22,197
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you're going to read this one.

228
00:16:22,217 --> 00:16:22,817
[SPEAKER_08]: If you are, I'm sorry.

229
00:16:23,097 --> 00:16:26,659
[SPEAKER_08]: But there was one email that pretty much simply said something like, you know, I'm a Mac user.

230
00:16:26,979 --> 00:16:27,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Skye, you're cool.

231
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,580
[SPEAKER_08]: You moderate.

232
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie, you rock.

233
00:16:29,721 --> 00:16:30,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, fuck you.

234
00:16:31,422 --> 00:16:31,682
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

235
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:33,823
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I forwarded that one.

236
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:35,183
[SPEAKER_06]: I really don't care.

237
00:16:35,324 --> 00:16:38,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone keeps bringing this up to me because they want me to argue about it.

238
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:40,626
[SPEAKER_06]: And I really don't care if you use a Mac.

239
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:43,548
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm never going to use it because I don't buy computers based on flavors.

240
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:43,748
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

241
00:16:45,245 --> 00:16:46,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Subject change, subject change

242
00:17:10,854 --> 00:17:12,015
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's funny.

243
00:17:12,596 --> 00:17:13,977
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have the same thing I had before.

244
00:17:14,457 --> 00:17:17,480
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a sinus infection now, which I'm taking antibiotics for.

245
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody wrote to my personal email suggesting you take a vitamin.

246
00:17:21,283 --> 00:17:22,584
[SPEAKER_01]: Me take a vitamin!

247
00:17:25,406 --> 00:17:29,530
[SPEAKER_08]: I mentioned that you used to work for GNC, so you're pretty well up on the vitamins.

248
00:17:30,931 --> 00:17:32,592
[SPEAKER_01]: I thank them for their concern.

249
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:35,595
[SPEAKER_08]: You attract the fanboys and the bugs.

250
00:17:36,996 --> 00:17:37,296
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

251
00:17:37,677 --> 00:17:38,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Womp womp.

252
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:51,541
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, also we got an email from Press Start about the comment about Tetris.

253
00:17:52,022 --> 00:17:53,663
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, the email was labeled Tetris is great.

254
00:17:53,683 --> 00:17:58,546
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, yes, every new console released for all eternity should have some version of Tetris.

255
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:03,569
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, rephrase, every new console released for all eternity should have the Game Boy version of Tetris.

256
00:18:04,069 --> 00:18:07,452
[SPEAKER_01]: And also Scorched Earth because that game is one of the best multiplayer games ever.

257
00:18:07,672 --> 00:18:07,912
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

258
00:18:08,411 --> 00:18:08,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Amen.

259
00:18:32,327 --> 00:18:34,148
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's still around somewhere.

260
00:18:34,168 --> 00:18:37,791
[SPEAKER_01]: I have Tetranet somewhere on my computer.

261
00:18:37,831 --> 00:18:38,692
[SPEAKER_08]: You only need the program.

262
00:18:39,132 --> 00:18:40,833
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to read this paragraph in the letter.

263
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:41,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

264
00:18:42,534 --> 00:18:50,320
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, now that you have all this time and you don't have to do your show as if you're playing Daytona USA News Topic Checkpoint, time extended, I have a suggestion.

265
00:18:50,962 --> 00:18:51,843
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

266
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:22,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie Sort Through That

267
00:19:44,196 --> 00:19:47,898
[SPEAKER_01]: who says, you asked about when we're changing the email addresses.

268
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:48,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, it's already changed.

269
00:19:48,878 --> 00:19:49,918
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the two go still works.

270
00:19:50,018 --> 00:19:51,019
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm checking all of them.

271
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:54,600
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I said I have a whole bunch of email to go through.

272
00:19:55,621 --> 00:19:59,762
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, about Dance Dance Revolution Supernova, is it only going to be in the arcades?

273
00:19:59,802 --> 00:20:03,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any chance of being able to play the new game at home?

274
00:20:03,443 --> 00:20:05,804
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no arcades in there, so it will be pretty hard to play this game.

275
00:20:06,144 --> 00:20:07,245
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, he loves the new format.

276
00:20:07,345 --> 00:20:09,346
[SPEAKER_01]: Having twice as much to listen to each week is awesome.

277
00:20:09,926 --> 00:20:10,426
[SPEAKER_01]: Aw, thank you.

278
00:20:11,124 --> 00:20:14,625
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm sure that it's a matter of time until we see it.

279
00:20:14,785 --> 00:20:19,986
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, it'll be eventually, I'm sure, if it's very popular.

280
00:20:20,566 --> 00:20:21,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, one last one.

281
00:20:23,686 --> 00:20:28,627
[SPEAKER_01]: BlazeGamerDude1212 wrote in, said, started listening to the show about two months ago.

282
00:20:28,647 --> 00:20:31,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Has to say that he thinks the three of us are amazingly good at what we do.

283
00:20:31,788 --> 00:20:33,388
[SPEAKER_01]: Aw, hugs.

284
00:20:33,508 --> 00:20:35,268
[SPEAKER_01]: And please continue to do what you are doing.

285
00:20:35,548 --> 00:20:36,709
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I want to correct Loki.

286
00:20:38,869 --> 00:20:45,634
[SPEAKER_01]: He said that the site for the new Xbox Live Diamond is www.xboxlivediamondcard.com and it isn't.

287
00:20:48,456 --> 00:21:00,746
[SPEAKER_01]: After hearing the xboxlivediamond.com site was fake, it went to xbox.com and looked through the site to get the Diamond Card site and it actually is xboxlivediamond.com.

288
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:01,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that still going on?

289
00:21:02,067 --> 00:21:05,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're still advertising even on the dashboard for 360.

290
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:05,809
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like...

291
00:21:07,494 --> 00:21:10,657
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't gotten my card, I signed up the first day they had it.

292
00:21:10,677 --> 00:21:12,719
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they'll make those when they make more 360s.

293
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:19,725
[SPEAKER_01]: A little addition, he also says that for fans of Triple Triad, he found the game online as Google's Triple Triad Gold.

294
00:21:21,787 --> 00:21:22,508
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, very cool.

295
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:25,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you have the email from the other podcaster that sent us the email?

296
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:27,463
[SPEAKER_08]: If not, I can pull it up because I read it too.

297
00:21:27,483 --> 00:21:27,763
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure I did.

298
00:21:27,783 --> 00:21:28,784
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go ahead and let you cover that.

299
00:21:28,824 --> 00:21:29,044
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

300
00:21:29,224 --> 00:21:35,810
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually received an email from another podcaster, sent us a message, and it was from... Let's see.

301
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,171
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got to find it in here somewhere.

302
00:21:38,011 --> 00:21:48,480
[SPEAKER_08]: It came from Godfrey, who's over at Gamertag Radio, his name in that show, and they wanted to tell us about this segment that was going on that they covered in their latest episode because...

303
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,321
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

304
00:22:11,815 --> 00:22:13,976
[SPEAKER_08]: I try to stay away from listening to them a lot.

305
00:22:14,677 --> 00:22:15,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Plus, I just don't have time.

306
00:22:16,478 --> 00:22:18,299
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do try to catch the occasional one.

307
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:24,943
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was listening to this Gamertag Radio, and I listened to their segment, and I thought it was pretty interesting, and I would recommend it.

308
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:32,028
[SPEAKER_08]: My only thing is that I saw it a little more as a social commentary than necessarily something about games.

309
00:22:32,048 --> 00:22:33,468
[SPEAKER_08]: They do incorporate games into it because...

310
00:22:35,427 --> 00:22:47,675
[SPEAKER_08]: The folks that do this show are other ethnic minorities, and they were kind of talking about that they don't like seeing games like 50 Cent Bulletproof being representations of the community and kind of being pushed there.

311
00:22:47,975 --> 00:22:51,137
[SPEAKER_08]: But they kind of talked a whole lot about other stuff too.

312
00:22:51,157 --> 00:22:52,318
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was a very good piece.

313
00:22:52,338 --> 00:22:55,840
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a very smart thing, so I'd recommend it certainly.

314
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:59,903
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a lot of minority stuff.

315
00:23:00,515 --> 00:23:07,218
[SPEAKER_08]: groups in America, and I'm sure feel a little bit underrepresented or stereotyped by video games sometimes.

316
00:23:07,378 --> 00:23:08,539
[SPEAKER_08]: So I thought this was a great piece.

317
00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:11,560
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I also thought was really good about this show, this particular show?

318
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:15,002
[SPEAKER_08]: The girl they have on that show is really good.

319
00:23:15,362 --> 00:23:28,889
[SPEAKER_08]: And she didn't say a whole lot during this segment, but I was kind of surprised because I expected Gamertag Radio to be mostly about Xbox, because, you know, Gamertag, but she was the one that brought up Nintendo, and she said, you know what, that's why I like Nintendo, because Nintendo...

320
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:30,560
[SPEAKER_08]: They're just fun.

321
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,481
[SPEAKER_08]: They just put out fun games.

322
00:23:32,601 --> 00:23:46,170
[SPEAKER_08]: I tend to agree that the games I like the best, I think about the two greatest games I played last year, Luminous and Meteos, were puzzle games that have nothing to do with race, color, religion, sexuality, stereotypes, nothing.

323
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,312
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just fun games.

324
00:23:49,212 --> 00:23:51,274
[SPEAKER_01]: You've missed the norm for anything out on GameCube.

325
00:23:51,674 --> 00:23:52,555
[SPEAKER_08]: I like her a lot.

326
00:23:52,615 --> 00:23:55,277
[SPEAKER_08]: You and her need to get together and do a girly show.

327
00:23:55,797 --> 00:23:56,517
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be good.

328
00:23:57,418 --> 00:23:58,138
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be good.

329
00:23:58,179 --> 00:23:58,739
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be good.

330
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:01,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Go check that out.

331
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:02,330
[SPEAKER_08]: It's good stuff.

332
00:24:03,371 --> 00:24:04,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Gamertagradio.com, I think.

333
00:24:04,992 --> 00:24:05,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Check it out.

334
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Search for them on iTunes.

335
00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:09,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's move on here.

336
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:10,475
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to go to another topic.

337
00:24:11,256 --> 00:24:17,459
[SPEAKER_08]: And Loki, well, speaking of some of these games that are an insult to some people, 25 to Life.

338
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Who hasn't 25 to Life insulted?

339
00:24:22,602 --> 00:24:23,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's see.

340
00:24:24,423 --> 00:24:26,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no, no.

341
00:24:26,324 --> 00:24:28,746
[SPEAKER_06]: 25 to Life, the National Law Enforcement...

342
00:24:29,486 --> 00:24:33,687
[SPEAKER_06]: and Officers Memorial Fund is calling for a boycott of 25 to Life.

343
00:24:33,888 --> 00:24:36,048
[SPEAKER_06]: And not because the game sucked and got horrible reviews.

344
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:42,531
[SPEAKER_06]: But apparently it's because the game promotes killing of cops and all that stuff.

345
00:24:42,591 --> 00:24:43,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Yada, yada, yada.

346
00:24:44,231 --> 00:24:52,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, they don't like it because the game really has no plot to it and just promotes killing of cops and killing of gangsters and kill, kill, kill.

347
00:24:53,134 --> 00:24:54,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Basic yada, yada, yada.

348
00:24:54,635 --> 00:24:56,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, so that's all you need to know.

349
00:24:56,735 --> 00:24:58,316
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the same reason why, you know,

350
00:24:58,735 --> 00:25:02,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Jack Thompson gets his paintings in the bunch over Grand Theft Auto and all those other games out there.

351
00:25:03,437 --> 00:25:05,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there an actual boycott going to happen?

352
00:25:05,858 --> 00:25:06,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Not likely.

353
00:25:06,479 --> 00:25:08,100
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, this will probably push sales up.

354
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,681
[SPEAKER_06]: So, way to go.

355
00:25:11,121 --> 00:25:13,182
[SPEAKER_08]: I know very little about this game.

356
00:25:13,582 --> 00:25:14,803
[SPEAKER_08]: What else do you know about this game?

357
00:25:15,003 --> 00:25:18,224
[SPEAKER_06]: 25th of Life basically revolves around three characters in the game.

358
00:25:19,645 --> 00:25:23,267
[SPEAKER_06]: For some reason, there's really hardly any missions to it as far as

359
00:25:24,109 --> 00:25:26,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Kill 25 Cops, Kill This, Kill That.

360
00:25:26,311 --> 00:25:31,293
[SPEAKER_06]: You get to play as either cops or gangbangers throughout the game.

361
00:25:31,834 --> 00:25:33,575
[SPEAKER_06]: They have multiplayer on it as well.

362
00:25:33,795 --> 00:25:37,857
[SPEAKER_06]: It was supposedly one of the better games coming out in January.

363
00:25:38,098 --> 00:25:40,519
[SPEAKER_06]: All of two that were good that were coming out.

364
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:44,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, it ended up getting horrible reviews.

365
00:25:44,101 --> 00:25:47,403
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe, if I remember correctly, IGN gave it a 3.9.

366
00:25:47,443 --> 00:25:50,185
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the highest I've seen for it is a 5 out of 10.

367
00:25:50,245 --> 00:25:50,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Really bad.

368
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:57,977
[SPEAKER_06]: because it's really buggy and stuff and the graphics suck and

369
00:25:58,527 --> 00:26:01,069
[SPEAKER_06]: 2old2play.com A website for gamers over 25

370
00:26:25,774 --> 00:26:26,515
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

371
00:26:54,953 --> 00:26:56,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Ask any non-gamer and they'll tell you.

372
00:26:56,814 --> 00:26:58,816
[SPEAKER_08]: We're all a bunch of slackers who never grew up.

373
00:26:58,896 --> 00:27:02,178
[SPEAKER_08]: This is an excellent tie-in to other controversial stories this week, right?

374
00:27:02,698 --> 00:27:09,863
[SPEAKER_08]: A bunch of overgrown kids who spend their money on games when there are real ways we could be spending our money, like on minivans with doors that open by themselves.

375
00:27:10,643 --> 00:27:12,184
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyway, the story goes on.

376
00:27:12,224 --> 00:27:17,528
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, any community tends to define itself in some way, so perhaps it's time the gaming community does the same.

377
00:27:17,948 --> 00:27:22,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Gamers are a diverse group, but most fall into one of six categories.

378
00:27:22,967 --> 00:27:25,709
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to ask you guys which category you think you fit into.

379
00:27:25,889 --> 00:27:26,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.

380
00:27:26,289 --> 00:27:27,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the six categories.

381
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,751
[SPEAKER_08]: Hardcore gamers.

382
00:27:30,611 --> 00:27:35,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Hardcore gamers, the average one they say is not married, but they say that's rare.

383
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:38,816
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a very small group.

384
00:27:39,756 --> 00:27:42,538
[SPEAKER_08]: They're just essentially hardcore gamers.

385
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:46,560
[SPEAKER_08]: They know their games and gaming the way that doctors know the bones of the body.

386
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:50,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Hardcore gamers know it all, and they're proud of their gaming knowledge.

387
00:27:51,251 --> 00:27:53,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, we have Devoted Gamers.

388
00:27:53,973 --> 00:27:59,536
[SPEAKER_08]: They have the singular obsession, the one game, whatever it may be, like Halo 2.

389
00:28:00,316 --> 00:28:04,379
[SPEAKER_08]: And sometimes Devoted players kind of move around a little bit.

390
00:28:05,699 --> 00:28:10,402
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they have the Addict, who is a very dark subset, they say, of the Devoted Gamer group.

391
00:28:10,462 --> 00:28:15,725
[SPEAKER_08]: The Addict, who gets into one MMORPG and gets addicted to... You know where I'm going with this, right?

392
00:28:15,745 --> 00:28:18,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Because Jamie always used to say, whenever we would talk about Final Fantasy XI.

393
00:28:20,097 --> 00:28:23,480
[SPEAKER_08]: The Pretend Hardcore Gamer Casual Gamers

394
00:28:43,058 --> 00:28:45,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Casual gamers tend to play only those games that get good reviews.

395
00:28:54,011 --> 00:28:55,031
[SPEAKER_08]: and sell a lot of copies.

396
00:28:55,391 --> 00:28:58,973
[SPEAKER_08]: And lastly, I'm sorry, almost last, the clueless gamer.

397
00:28:59,633 --> 00:29:05,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Clueless gamers buy a lot of games where they're not really good at any of them and they give up on them before they become good.

398
00:29:05,335 --> 00:29:13,197
[SPEAKER_08]: These are the gamers who do things that puzzle you, make a lot of mistakes and get pretty frustrated by that, but also aren't willing to listen to suggestions or take any time to improve.

399
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:15,798
[SPEAKER_08]: And then lastly, the worthless gamer.

400
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:20,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Cheaters, hackers, de-levelers, punks, jackasses,

401
00:29:21,087 --> 00:29:21,808
[SPEAKER_08]: All that stuff.

402
00:29:21,888 --> 00:29:23,849
[SPEAKER_08]: The people that just go in there to ruin games.

403
00:29:23,889 --> 00:29:24,670
[SPEAKER_08]: The worthless gamer.

404
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Which gamer are you?

405
00:29:26,271 --> 00:29:29,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Hardcore, devoted, pretend hardcore, casual, clueless, worthless.

406
00:29:29,873 --> 00:29:30,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

407
00:29:31,254 --> 00:29:32,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Hardcore and worthless.

408
00:29:34,236 --> 00:29:34,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is this?

409
00:29:35,997 --> 00:29:39,660
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to know my game knowledge just for working here.

410
00:29:40,601 --> 00:29:41,821
[SPEAKER_06]: I play a lot of games during the week.

411
00:29:41,861 --> 00:29:43,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Not as much as I used to, but I still play.

412
00:29:44,503 --> 00:29:46,384
[SPEAKER_06]: I always have a game system with me.

413
00:29:47,557 --> 00:29:47,817
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura

414
00:30:13,627 --> 00:30:21,334
[SPEAKER_08]: The categories, just to give me... Sure, hardcore, devoted, pretend hardcore, casual, clueless, worthless.

415
00:30:22,935 --> 00:30:28,220
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say hardcore for the old school stuff, just because you know my collection.

416
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:28,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

417
00:30:31,363 --> 00:30:32,364
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally can't see them.

418
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:35,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Hardcore, devoted, pretend hardcore, casual, clueless, worthless.

419
00:30:36,647 --> 00:30:40,511
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say I'm pretty devoted to once I get to playing something, because I like to finish it.

420
00:30:41,232 --> 00:30:43,935
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely not a major cheater.

421
00:30:44,036 --> 00:30:44,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, okay.

422
00:30:45,017 --> 00:30:50,023
[SPEAKER_01]: I do cheat my way through Silent Hill 3 just because I'm not really playing it for the gameplay.

423
00:30:50,063 --> 00:30:51,004
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm playing it for the story.

424
00:30:51,424 --> 00:30:52,165
[SPEAKER_08]: And the sexy beam.

425
00:30:53,447 --> 00:30:54,368
[SPEAKER_01]: The heza beam!

426
00:30:55,569 --> 00:30:56,330
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the heza beam.

427
00:30:57,632 --> 00:30:59,274
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's just...

428
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:01,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Nerd Gamer

429
00:31:20,234 --> 00:31:22,957
[SPEAKER_08]: You sound a little bit like a cross between hardcore and devoted to me.

430
00:31:23,157 --> 00:31:23,517
[SPEAKER_08]: A little bit.

431
00:31:24,378 --> 00:31:29,963
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say, I'm kind of somewhere between, you know what's weird is that I think I'm kind of like half devoted, half clueless.

432
00:31:30,384 --> 00:31:39,512
[SPEAKER_08]: The only reason I say I'm clueless is because I'm notorious for my gaming ADD where I will play one game for like a little bit of time and then I go to something else.

433
00:31:39,532 --> 00:31:40,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I lose interest and I go to something else.

434
00:31:41,414 --> 00:31:41,594
[SPEAKER_08]: But,

435
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:44,955
[SPEAKER_08]: When I get devoted into a game, I get really devoted to the game.

436
00:31:44,995 --> 00:31:50,478
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'd say in a way, I just don't think I'm to the line where I can really call myself hardcore.

437
00:31:50,538 --> 00:31:57,161
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel that I do know a lot about games and stuff, but I realize that there's a whole world outside of that too.

438
00:31:57,281 --> 00:31:59,482
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know if I can really call myself hardcore.

439
00:31:59,842 --> 00:32:00,762
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm somewhere between there.

440
00:32:00,802 --> 00:32:03,504
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'd say I'm very devoted to a lot of games too.

441
00:32:03,524 --> 00:32:05,084
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some games that I can never put down.

442
00:32:05,484 --> 00:32:08,266
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's other games I just bounce around a whole awful lot.

443
00:32:08,346 --> 00:32:09,046
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm somewhere in there.

444
00:32:09,857 --> 00:32:22,605
[SPEAKER_08]: If you guys want to read the whole article and figure out which one of those you are, TooOldToPlay.com Up next on the show, we're going to take your calls right now on the Skype line.

447
00:32:37,879 --> 00:32:38,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you what?

448
00:33:01,812 --> 00:33:02,853
[SPEAKER_07]: The 100th caller?

449
00:33:02,933 --> 00:33:04,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you the 100th caller?

450
00:33:04,294 --> 00:33:05,855
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you're the first caller tonight.

451
00:33:05,895 --> 00:33:06,476
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind?

452
00:33:07,076 --> 00:33:07,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan, it's Ranma.

453
00:33:07,737 --> 00:33:09,338
[SPEAKER_08]: I was hoping I'd get a free toaster out of this.

454
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,340
[SPEAKER_08]: We might be able to hook you up with that anyway.

455
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,261
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll bring you a toaster.

456
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:13,642
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll bring you a Hello Kitty toaster.

457
00:33:13,662 --> 00:33:14,943
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll send you a Linux toaster.

458
00:33:15,003 --> 00:33:18,346
[SPEAKER_08]: When I come out for AkatsuCon, I'll bring a Hello Kitty toaster.

459
00:33:19,006 --> 00:33:21,108
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm giving it to my sister at DarkSakura.

460
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:23,049
[SPEAKER_07]: I already showed you Linux on a toaster.

461
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:23,830
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

462
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:25,932
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw it.

463
00:33:26,092 --> 00:33:29,655
[SPEAKER_07]: First off, I have to ask you, DJ Ranma S, what kind of gamer are you?

464
00:33:30,623 --> 00:33:32,184
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the casual gamer, okay?

465
00:33:32,464 --> 00:33:34,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's a quick example of the hardcore gamer.

466
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:36,327
[SPEAKER_07]: My friend got Kingdom Hearts 2.

467
00:33:37,308 --> 00:33:38,288
[SPEAKER_07]: He beat the game in two weeks.

468
00:33:38,749 --> 00:33:39,409
[SPEAKER_07]: That's hardcore.

469
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:40,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

470
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:46,434
[SPEAKER_08]: That's almost addiction, but does your other friend go outside and hug a tree once in a while?

471
00:33:47,615 --> 00:33:48,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, no.

472
00:33:49,036 --> 00:33:50,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, then maybe he's addicted.

473
00:33:51,057 --> 00:33:51,357
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

474
00:33:52,078 --> 00:33:53,199
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, enough about your friend, though.

475
00:33:53,219 --> 00:33:54,900
[SPEAKER_08]: What made you want to call in tonight?

476
00:33:55,569 --> 00:33:58,771
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to say what's up, how you guys doing, and how much I love the show so far.

477
00:33:59,132 --> 00:33:59,772
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, thank you so much.

478
00:33:59,812 --> 00:34:01,653
[SPEAKER_08]: We appreciate the occasional compliment call.

479
00:34:01,974 --> 00:34:02,394
[SPEAKER_08]: It's good.

480
00:34:04,015 --> 00:34:04,776
[SPEAKER_08]: We're doing good.

481
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:05,996
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd say I'm doing pretty well.

482
00:34:06,016 --> 00:34:07,758
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been doing a lot of venting tonight, which is good.

483
00:34:07,858 --> 00:34:08,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I heard.

484
00:34:08,958 --> 00:34:12,181
[SPEAKER_07]: As soon as I got home from Jersey, I jumped onto the stream.

485
00:34:12,201 --> 00:34:16,824
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard DarkSakura foaming at the mouth about a DarkSakura president.

486
00:34:17,725 --> 00:34:21,207
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think about the whole Flowers for Jack Thompson campaign?

487
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:23,208
[SPEAKER_07]: I have better things to do with $20.

488
00:34:23,249 --> 00:34:23,409
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean...

489
00:34:26,661 --> 00:34:28,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Let the little maggot run his mouth.

490
00:34:28,362 --> 00:34:28,922
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care.

491
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:30,382
[SPEAKER_07]: He's not going to stop me from buying the game.

492
00:34:31,263 --> 00:34:31,603
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

493
00:34:31,623 --> 00:34:33,083
[SPEAKER_08]: You can put the $20 down towards the game.

494
00:34:33,103 --> 00:34:33,784
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a very good point.

495
00:34:34,804 --> 00:34:39,185
[SPEAKER_07]: And if he somehow makes it that a game is not coming out, don't worry.

496
00:34:39,565 --> 00:34:41,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody will find a way, and we'll have it.

497
00:34:42,767 --> 00:34:43,227
[SPEAKER_08]: Very true.

498
00:34:43,487 --> 00:34:43,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Very true.

499
00:34:44,427 --> 00:34:46,568
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else you want to share with our callers tonight, DJ Ranma S?

500
00:34:47,548 --> 00:34:52,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, earlier about the whole Jared Nintendo thing being fat, whatever.

501
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Look, get up.

502
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:55,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Go outside and play.

503
00:34:56,447 --> 00:34:58,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't you think they blew his quote a little bit out of context, though?

504
00:34:59,348 --> 00:35:00,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think you really meant it?

505
00:35:00,129 --> 00:35:00,529
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the media.

506
00:35:00,929 --> 00:35:01,349
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the media.

507
00:35:01,369 --> 00:35:03,610
[SPEAKER_07]: They always blow shit out of proportion.

508
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, true.

509
00:35:05,091 --> 00:35:05,751
[SPEAKER_07]: I can agree with you there.

510
00:35:07,692 --> 00:35:10,713
[SPEAKER_07]: I just let it go, and I just do my thing, and it's good.

511
00:35:11,033 --> 00:35:11,353
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

512
00:35:11,513 --> 00:35:11,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good.

513
00:35:12,014 --> 00:35:13,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Ranma, thank you so much for the call.

514
00:35:13,714 --> 00:35:14,394
[SPEAKER_08]: We appreciate it, okay?

515
00:35:14,414 --> 00:35:14,755
[SPEAKER_07]: No problem.

516
00:35:14,875 --> 00:35:15,275
[SPEAKER_07]: You got it.

517
00:35:15,315 --> 00:35:15,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Later.

518
00:35:15,455 --> 00:35:15,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care, buddy.

519
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:17,336
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

520
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to another call.

521
00:35:18,396 --> 00:35:18,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

522
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:19,737
[SPEAKER_05]: You're on Orange Launch Radio.

523
00:35:20,597 --> 00:35:20,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, hey.

524
00:35:21,257 --> 00:35:21,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

525
00:35:21,517 --> 00:35:21,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

526
00:35:21,898 --> 00:35:22,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

527
00:35:23,686 --> 00:35:27,628
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Keith, I'm Ranma, or I'm Ranma on the forums.

528
00:35:28,048 --> 00:35:31,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Keith, turn down your stream going out.

529
00:35:33,651 --> 00:35:34,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I did.

530
00:35:34,611 --> 00:35:37,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, what time do you mind?

531
00:35:37,433 --> 00:35:49,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I was going to ask you guys a question, since I know that you guys originally started out as really a Bimani radio, a music games podcast radio thing.

532
00:35:49,578 --> 00:35:52,700
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to ask, what are your favorite songs to DDR to?

533
00:35:54,525 --> 00:35:55,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Arena of Sorrow Max 2

534
00:36:23,167 --> 00:36:27,490
[SPEAKER_08]: My favorite old school song is Oh Nick Please Not So Quick, because you know, erotic, awesome.

535
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:30,491
[SPEAKER_08]: Say what you want, don't hate, don't hate, that song's awesome.

536
00:36:31,011 --> 00:36:36,855
[SPEAKER_08]: And my favorite new school song is Skulk by Echo Image in DDR Ultramix 2, because that song is awesome.

537
00:36:36,915 --> 00:36:39,996
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that song, it like totally breathed new life into DDR, love it.

538
00:36:40,937 --> 00:36:42,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to another call, see if we have some luck over here.

539
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:44,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

540
00:36:45,319 --> 00:36:47,220
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Legend of Zaku, what's up boss?

541
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello Zaku, what's on your mind?

542
00:36:48,761 --> 00:36:50,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, did you know we got your poster?

543
00:36:50,894 --> 00:36:54,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I sent it over a month ago.

544
00:36:54,457 --> 00:36:56,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, I finally got 2DX.

545
00:36:57,559 --> 00:36:58,480
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, it was so late.

546
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,922
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so late in the game because I was so poor, but I managed to find the money.

547
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:03,043
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we love it.

548
00:37:03,123 --> 00:37:03,884
[SPEAKER_08]: We love the poster.

549
00:37:03,944 --> 00:37:04,544
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so awesome.

550
00:37:04,564 --> 00:37:05,465
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hanging here in the studio.

551
00:37:05,525 --> 00:37:07,346
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an In The Groove 2 signed poster.

552
00:37:08,027 --> 00:37:12,790
[SPEAKER_08]: If you listen to our old show, like the old live show we did, you'll understand why that's hilarious.

553
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,912
[SPEAKER_08]: But for now, Zaku, I've got to keep it moving.

554
00:37:14,952 --> 00:37:16,433
[SPEAKER_08]: What brings you to call tonight?

555
00:37:17,506 --> 00:37:20,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if I got 2DX and all, I'm just trying to break into it.

556
00:37:20,849 --> 00:37:21,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Any advice?

557
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:25,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I just started playing that, you know, I think a couple of weeks ago.

558
00:37:26,594 --> 00:37:29,877
[SPEAKER_03]: And so far, I've pretty much poured out 9th style to, you know, to its

559
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,241
[SPEAKER_03]: 2DX Beat Mania

560
00:37:51,457 --> 00:37:54,839
[SPEAKER_08]: For years now, there's a whole lot of these games out in Japan.

561
00:37:54,879 --> 00:38:05,645
[SPEAKER_08]: It started with 3rd style, don't ask, but it started with 3rd style and all the way through 10th style now and supposedly 2DX Red on the way as well, which was 11th style, for lack of a better term.

562
00:38:07,166 --> 00:38:12,750
[SPEAKER_08]: A whole lot of these games out there with a hardcore following and finally we're going to be getting a version of it here in America soon.

563
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:16,472
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as getting started with it, I think the best way to learn

564
00:38:17,671 --> 00:38:31,339
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think they still have this in the newer styles, but in 5th style and 6th style they had what was called a drill mode, and it would show you how to do certain key patterns, and of course the game uses a turntable and white and black keys, so you play rhythms and make your own beats.

565
00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:40,805
[SPEAKER_08]: And the old 5th and 6th have drill mode, which I think is a great way to learn how to play the game, and sometimes it can be really obnoxious because you have to do a lot of repetition, but it's really good.

566
00:38:40,905 --> 00:38:42,206
[SPEAKER_08]: It gets you really good at the game.

567
00:38:42,226 --> 00:38:42,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

568
00:38:42,666 --> 00:38:47,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think I should have gotten that because, you know, 9th style doesn't really have that much except for beginner mode.

569
00:38:48,411 --> 00:38:51,074
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing I'm trying to do right now is trying to do the ranking.

570
00:38:52,523 --> 00:38:56,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Does Nightstyle have the mode where you can practice the song and slow it down?

571
00:38:56,606 --> 00:39:01,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you have those modes where you can actually practice measures in training mode.

572
00:39:01,268 --> 00:39:03,730
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the best way to do it when there's lack of a drill mode.

573
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:15,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Take a song you can almost pass and slow it down in that mode and work at it, because most of Beatmania is just hearing the rhythms in your head and knowing when to hit the keys, and that's really the best way to be good at it.

574
00:39:16,298 --> 00:39:17,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else on your mind, Zaku?

575
00:39:17,278 --> 00:39:18,299
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got to keep it moving, but...

576
00:39:19,378 --> 00:39:23,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I guess, you know, just saying what's up and everything.

577
00:39:23,701 --> 00:39:24,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, what type of gamer are you?

578
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:30,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, I don't think I call myself casual, but I'm like up there.

579
00:39:30,866 --> 00:39:33,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Not hardcore, not really casual, but in the middle.

580
00:39:33,628 --> 00:39:34,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Like devoted?

581
00:39:34,528 --> 00:39:37,570
[SPEAKER_03]: I pretty much have an open mind on many games.

582
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:38,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you say you're devoted?

583
00:39:39,952 --> 00:39:43,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of, I mean, with DDR, yes, and with Bomani also.

584
00:39:43,835 --> 00:39:46,656
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, I also have my first person shooters and my ROMs.

585
00:39:48,258 --> 00:39:49,700
[SPEAKER_03]: and all the other internet things.

586
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you sound devoted to me.

587
00:39:51,142 --> 00:39:51,663
[SPEAKER_03]: You're devoted.

588
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:53,405
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear my W devoted.

589
00:39:54,126 --> 00:39:54,466
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

590
00:39:55,067 --> 00:39:56,189
[SPEAKER_08]: Sakura, thanks so much for the call.

591
00:39:56,229 --> 00:39:56,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care.

592
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:58,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, anytime, man.

593
00:39:58,272 --> 00:39:58,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Later.

594
00:39:59,429 --> 00:40:01,990
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, thank you guys for your calls.

595
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:02,690
[SPEAKER_08]: We appreciate that.

596
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:07,072
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to keep things moving here on Orange Launch Radio tonight, but of course we appreciate the calls as always.

597
00:40:07,392 --> 00:40:10,554
[SPEAKER_08]: If we have time later in the show, I don't know if we will tonight, but we'll take more calls a little later.

598
00:40:11,694 --> 00:40:16,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on, though, we've got other news, starting off with PlayStation 3 news.

599
00:40:16,856 --> 00:40:18,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie, you have some news on the PlayStation 3?

600
00:40:19,157 --> 00:40:19,857
[SPEAKER_01]: I do indeed.

601
00:40:21,598 --> 00:40:22,558
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, there's a...

602
00:40:24,525 --> 00:40:40,259
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been predicted that an analyst by the name of Evan Wilson has predicted that the PS3 will launch in November in North America with a summer launch in Japan followed by a March 2007 European launch.

603
00:40:42,061 --> 00:40:50,268
[SPEAKER_01]: However, this conflicts with what a lot of the analysts over here are saying regarding when it's going to be out.

604
00:40:50,428 --> 00:40:50,889
[SPEAKER_01]: However,

605
00:40:53,223 --> 00:40:58,308
[SPEAKER_01]: He's actually gone on, this analyst has gone on to predict volumes for the system as well.

606
00:40:58,969 --> 00:41:04,754
[SPEAKER_01]: He believes that the PS3 will have a million units in Japan in the summer with similar volumes in the US in November.

607
00:41:05,415 --> 00:41:08,318
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, a similar number for the European market.

608
00:41:09,319 --> 00:41:11,861
[SPEAKER_01]: And that it's basically going to exceed the Xbox 360.

609
00:41:11,901 --> 00:41:12,081
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

610
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,120
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

611
00:41:41,846 --> 00:41:53,390
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, basically, the Japanese PlayStation site put up a few links to six games they had up on their site, and then took them down without explanation.

612
00:41:54,851 --> 00:42:01,453
[SPEAKER_01]: So, was it that they said, huh, maybe we shouldn't put them out and just hope they don't notice, or...

613
00:42:04,241 --> 00:42:14,490
[SPEAKER_01]: GameIndustry.biz got something out of a Sony spokesperson that said, we're working on the launch of the PS3 and confirmed a list of titles that will be announced at the appropriate time.

614
00:42:15,952 --> 00:42:18,034
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that wasn't it, was it?

615
00:42:18,134 --> 00:42:19,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you remember what any of those titles were?

616
00:42:20,076 --> 00:42:20,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

617
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:27,683
[SPEAKER_01]: According to one of my sources, there was...

618
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:38,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Genji 2, Angel Rings, Monster Carnival, Everybody's Golf 5, Gran Turismo, and Eye of Judgment.

619
00:42:39,065 --> 00:42:41,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Gran Turismo will be a pretty sweet launch title in this country, I know that.

620
00:42:42,086 --> 00:42:44,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Some we do know of, though, is Metal Gear Solid 4.

621
00:42:45,228 --> 00:42:46,549
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a demo of a Tekken game.

622
00:42:47,469 --> 00:42:50,131
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's still speculation regarding the Final Fantasy franchise.

623
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:50,971
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

624
00:42:51,591 --> 00:42:52,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Very interesting.

625
00:42:52,412 --> 00:42:55,053
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, there is in development a version of Unreal Tournament 2007.

626
00:42:55,133 --> 00:42:55,573
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

627
00:42:59,306 --> 00:43:27,417
[SPEAKER_08]: I also can confirm this, there was another story that ran on Joystick.com earlier this week Virtua Fighter 5 for PlayStation 3 has been confirmed and it's actually coming from this month's issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly Virtua Fighter 5 is coming to the PS3 and it might be exclusive and then there's a sexy little screenshot but I don't know if that's actually from the game or just something the site put to kind of tag that with but certainly fans of Virtua Fighter of which I know one, and she's in the room

628
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:29,033
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

629
00:43:29,253 --> 00:43:30,173
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought you liked Virtua Fighter.

630
00:43:30,273 --> 00:43:31,294
[SPEAKER_01]: I loathe Virtua Fighter.

631
00:43:31,414 --> 00:43:31,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wow.

632
00:43:31,774 --> 00:43:33,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, then I don't know anyone who likes Virtua Fighter, I guess.

633
00:43:33,594 --> 00:43:34,574
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the Tekken fangirl.

634
00:43:34,694 --> 00:43:38,255
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you like... I thought for some reason you were also... I get the Sega thing.

635
00:43:39,235 --> 00:43:44,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Virtua Fighter made me gag so much when the first ones were out, I was not able to enjoy the series ever since.

636
00:43:44,876 --> 00:43:47,097
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you what Virtua Fighter made me gag.

637
00:43:47,137 --> 00:43:50,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Virtua Fighter 2 on the Genesis, where they took it and made it 2D.

638
00:43:50,157 --> 00:43:50,597
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

639
00:43:52,398 --> 00:43:53,818
[SPEAKER_01]: Except Virtua Fighter Kids was kind of fun.

640
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:57,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's talk more PlayStation 3.

641
00:43:57,157 --> 00:44:01,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, you have some stories about, like, there was, like, a survey going on with PS3?

642
00:44:01,219 --> 00:44:09,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's a survey that's been around, going around, too, basically, because I don't know if anyone's actually played online with the PlayStation 2.

643
00:44:10,024 --> 00:44:12,846
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically a big clusterfuck of, you know, what's going on.

644
00:44:12,866 --> 00:44:23,612
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't really have a system, it's just kind of out there, and the original idea for Sony for the PlayStation 3 was, hey, it worked before, let's go ahead and do it again, and they're kind of looking at it like,

645
00:44:24,444 --> 00:44:27,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we should come out with something like Xbox Live.

646
00:44:28,006 --> 00:44:34,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, so the thing that's going around right now is there are about 33 questions or so asking different things.

647
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:36,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, for example, some things they hint at.

648
00:44:37,171 --> 00:44:39,052
[SPEAKER_06]: A specific lobby only for adults.

649
00:44:39,112 --> 00:44:41,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Would that be something that you'd be interested in?

650
00:44:41,493 --> 00:44:42,994
[SPEAKER_08]: With the sexy iToy plugin.

651
00:44:44,315 --> 00:44:46,836
[SPEAKER_06]: iToy plugin for game lobbies.

652
00:44:48,297 --> 00:44:49,838
[SPEAKER_06]: USB keyboard support.

653
00:44:50,318 --> 00:44:53,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Just, you know, all the standard stuff that you pretty much see in Xbox Live.

654
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,201
[SPEAKER_06]: They're asking, hey, you want this?

655
00:44:56,321 --> 00:44:57,302
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that type of thing.

656
00:44:58,002 --> 00:45:06,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, I mean, begs the question, if they're not going to have USB keyboard support, then why the hell do they have so many USB ports on the goddamn thing anyways?

657
00:45:06,888 --> 00:45:07,709
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I want to know.

658
00:45:08,029 --> 00:45:13,052
[SPEAKER_06]: So, of course they're going to have USB support for the, you know, keyboard.

659
00:45:13,733 --> 00:45:18,216
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's something that's kind of going on right now, friends lists and whatnot, so.

660
00:45:19,409 --> 00:45:19,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Be interesting.

661
00:45:20,209 --> 00:45:21,570
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, now, moving on.

662
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:23,170
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is PlayStation 3 related.

663
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:24,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Something about Pioneer?

664
00:45:25,051 --> 00:45:33,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Pioneer, the people making the Blu-ray player, they threw out some crazy numbers for what they thought the PS3 launch was going to be.

665
00:45:34,513 --> 00:45:35,394
[SPEAKER_06]: And this, I had to laugh.

666
00:45:36,134 --> 00:45:41,135
[SPEAKER_06]: See, originally, the estimates were 1 million units for launch in the United States.

667
00:45:41,175 --> 00:45:46,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Pioneer is saying that they are going to have as many as 7 million units available for launch in

668
00:45:48,354 --> 00:45:49,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

669
00:45:49,837 --> 00:45:51,240
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a lot of overtime.

670
00:45:51,521 --> 00:45:52,122
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so.

671
00:45:52,543 --> 00:45:53,505
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, let's put it this way.

672
00:45:55,469 --> 00:45:58,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless they're planning on launching in 2009, that ain't going to happen.

673
00:45:59,941 --> 00:46:00,301
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

674
00:46:00,962 --> 00:46:01,242
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

675
00:46:02,083 --> 00:46:07,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on to a completely different topic, but this is somewhat PlayStation related, but it's also Xbox related.

676
00:46:07,968 --> 00:46:09,789
[SPEAKER_08]: New homebrew for the PSP that's not Tetris?

677
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:10,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

678
00:46:11,651 --> 00:46:17,936
[SPEAKER_06]: This homebrew is actually a port of a PC game, which is also a kind of a knockoff of Geometry Wars.

679
00:46:18,036 --> 00:46:20,298
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Vector and Vector for the PSP.

680
00:46:20,878 --> 00:46:24,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Very similar to Geometry Wars in the way it plays.

681
00:46:25,162 --> 00:46:28,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, the control scheme is a little bit not as good.

682
00:46:29,326 --> 00:46:32,988
[SPEAKER_06]: as the 360 because you don't have the dual analog on a PSP.

683
00:46:33,548 --> 00:46:35,489
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's really awesome.

684
00:46:35,529 --> 00:46:42,272
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only available, though, for the 1.5 firmware, so hopefully you've got that or you can downgrade.

685
00:46:43,552 --> 00:46:46,854
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's available on your various PSP sites like PSP Updates.

686
00:46:47,834 --> 00:46:48,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.

687
00:46:48,635 --> 00:46:53,097
[SPEAKER_08]: So for those folks that can't get your Xbox 360 to play Geometry Wars, maybe this is a good substitute.

688
00:46:53,337 --> 00:46:53,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

689
00:46:54,117 --> 00:46:58,139
[SPEAKER_06]: And if for whatever reason you can't get a version for the PSP,

690
00:46:58,561 --> 00:47:11,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, there's still the PC version of the game, which is available at bagfullofwrong.co.uk slash games slash vector.html Alright.

691
00:47:12,814 --> 00:47:13,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, moving on.

692
00:47:13,454 --> 00:47:15,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, you had some news on Majesco.

693
00:47:16,117 --> 00:47:17,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Something was going on with Majesco.

694
00:47:18,619 --> 00:47:21,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Majesco's getting out of the hardcore gaming business.

695
00:47:21,682 --> 00:47:24,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, they're not making any more...

696
00:47:26,095 --> 00:47:26,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Aeon Flux Aeon Flux

697
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:38,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that answers a lot.

698
00:47:39,148 --> 00:47:42,749
[SPEAKER_01]: They've canned a couple of the games already.

699
00:47:42,769 --> 00:47:43,449
[SPEAKER_06]: What was in progress?

700
00:47:43,829 --> 00:47:45,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Taxi Driver and Demonic.

701
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:46,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's right.

702
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:47,830
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember reading the report on Taxi Driver now.

703
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:51,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're not doing too well as far as stuff that's coming out.

704
00:47:51,251 --> 00:48:00,312
[SPEAKER_06]: I know some of their games are being pulled, but it's probably just they're just looking, you know, self-preservation, so... Yeah.

705
00:48:00,632 --> 00:48:00,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

706
00:48:02,633 --> 00:48:05,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of things gone bad...

707
00:48:06,397 --> 00:48:06,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Majesco did Psychonauts

708
00:48:33,602 --> 00:48:39,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Electronic Gaming Monthly, the worst 10, not the top 10, but the worst 10 games ever reviewed.

709
00:48:39,646 --> 00:48:42,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Batman Beyond, number 10, for the PS1.

710
00:48:43,389 --> 00:48:45,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Who Wants to Beat Up a Millionaire on the Dreamcast?

711
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:47,011
[SPEAKER_01]: That was hilarious.

712
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:48,372
[SPEAKER_01]: That game was fun.

713
00:48:48,472 --> 00:48:49,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Got a 1.0 score.

714
00:48:50,534 --> 00:48:53,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Powerpuff Girls Paint the Townsville Green for the Game Boy Color.

715
00:48:54,796 --> 00:48:59,840
[SPEAKER_08]: And then right behind that at number 7, Powerpuff Girls Bad Mojo Jojo, also for the Game Boy Color.

716
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:02,751
[SPEAKER_08]: It was also in the same issue.

717
00:49:03,172 --> 00:49:06,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Kiss Pinball for the PlayStation 1 was number 6.

718
00:49:06,436 --> 00:49:07,177
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that.

719
00:49:07,257 --> 00:49:08,860
[SPEAKER_01]: The Psycho Circus game.

720
00:49:10,522 --> 00:49:11,843
[SPEAKER_08]: Urban Champion E.

721
00:49:12,737 --> 00:49:14,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Which was for the Game Boy Advance.

722
00:49:15,399 --> 00:49:17,521
[SPEAKER_08]: For some reason, I think they re-released this on the Advance.

723
00:49:17,541 --> 00:49:18,642
[SPEAKER_08]: It was one of their games they put on the Advance.

724
00:49:18,782 --> 00:49:19,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Urban Champion?

725
00:49:19,843 --> 00:49:21,725
[SPEAKER_08]: That game sucked balls on Nintendo.

726
00:49:21,745 --> 00:49:24,187
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like Nintendo's little blemish of the 8-bit era.

727
00:49:24,547 --> 00:49:26,929
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, who remembers Urban Champion?

728
00:49:27,169 --> 00:49:29,391
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, like, Hogan's Alley, awesome.

729
00:49:29,611 --> 00:49:34,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Other games, other 8-bit classics made by Nintendo that were forgotten about like that were awesome.

730
00:49:34,315 --> 00:49:35,036
[SPEAKER_08]: But Urban Champion?

731
00:49:35,697 --> 00:49:36,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Easy, forgotten.

732
00:49:37,311 --> 00:49:39,432
[SPEAKER_08]: 4.

733
00:49:37,571 --> 00:49:39,432
[SPEAKER_08]: The Guy Game, Loki, Rebuttal, 3.

734
00:49:39,472 --> 00:49:40,814
[SPEAKER_08]: Mortal Kombat Advance, 4.

735
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:09,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Number two, the number two worst game of all time, according to an EGM list here on 1up.com, The Flintstones Bedrock Bowling.

736
00:50:09,955 --> 00:50:11,757
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a reason why I never heard of that game, apparently.

737
00:50:12,137 --> 00:50:19,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the number one worst game of all time reviewed on EGM, and it's a game I own because it was a gift.

738
00:50:20,182 --> 00:50:25,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Ping Pals for the Nintendo DS was the worst reviewed game of all time.

739
00:50:26,707 --> 00:50:29,709
[SPEAKER_08]: and rightfully so in many ways because Pink Pals kind of sucks.

740
00:50:29,969 --> 00:50:30,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, you're shaking your head.

741
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:33,392
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think there's a worse game out there.

742
00:50:33,452 --> 00:50:33,852
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?

743
00:50:33,872 --> 00:50:37,855
[SPEAKER_06]: This is basically the manos, the hands of fate for PC games.

744
00:50:37,895 --> 00:50:38,896
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Big Rigs.

745
00:50:39,428 --> 00:50:47,372
[SPEAKER_06]: If you go to GameSpot.com and look for the review on Big Rigs, the game came out... Now, this is not the same as Big Mother Truckers.

746
00:50:47,432 --> 00:50:49,133
[SPEAKER_06]: No, this isn't the same as Big Mother Truckers.

747
00:50:49,493 --> 00:50:55,456
[SPEAKER_06]: You came out... It's a Big Rigs racing game, and the AI doesn't move.

748
00:50:55,936 --> 00:50:59,298
[SPEAKER_06]: The other cars don't move, so it's impossible for you to lose a race.

749
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:01,159
[SPEAKER_06]: The physics aren't there.

750
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:02,300
[SPEAKER_06]: You fall through bridges.

751
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,700
[SPEAKER_06]: You can drive off the map.

752
00:51:04,101 --> 00:51:08,503
[SPEAKER_06]: There is no limit to your acceleration, so you can hold down and go a million miles an hour...

753
00:51:08,823 --> 00:51:12,145
[SPEAKER_06]: I was gonna go around and ask, what do you think were things that they missed on this list?

754
00:51:28,988 --> 00:51:29,548
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

755
00:51:59,767 --> 00:52:01,428
[SPEAKER_01]: There were games I thought were overrated.

756
00:52:02,128 --> 00:52:08,212
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, certainly, I like Ridge Racer a whole bunch, but I thought Ridge Racer 6 was kind of overrated.

757
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:15,436
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say that there's any that I really dislike that I actually played, put effort into.

758
00:52:15,756 --> 00:52:16,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Fair enough, fair enough.

759
00:52:16,737 --> 00:52:17,057
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

760
00:52:17,237 --> 00:52:21,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, Smackdown vs. Raw on the PSP because it gave a noise the hell out of me.

761
00:52:22,496 --> 00:52:23,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Some comments from the chat room.

762
00:52:24,357 --> 00:52:27,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Some folks there are putting in their own two cents here.

763
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:32,422
[SPEAKER_08]: Funnydale says, Worst game of all time, Back to the Future for the NES.

764
00:52:33,203 --> 00:52:34,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Back to the Future 2 and 3.

765
00:52:35,144 --> 00:52:35,544
[SPEAKER_01]: E.T.

766
00:52:35,604 --> 00:52:35,744
[SPEAKER_01]: on the 2600.

767
00:52:37,365 --> 00:52:38,566
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually played E.T.

768
00:52:38,746 --> 00:52:41,728
[SPEAKER_08]: on the 2600 when I was like six years old and found it entertaining.

769
00:52:42,148 --> 00:52:43,829
[SPEAKER_08]: But of course I was six years old, so you know.

770
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:45,430
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Smurfs on Click Division.

771
00:52:45,611 --> 00:52:46,971
[SPEAKER_08]: The Smurfs was badass.

772
00:52:47,292 --> 00:52:49,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I love the Smurfs game.

773
00:52:49,153 --> 00:52:51,034
[SPEAKER_06]: I played that all the time when I was like four.

774
00:52:52,621 --> 00:52:54,122
[SPEAKER_01]: MagMax on the NES.

775
00:52:54,642 --> 00:52:55,602
[SPEAKER_06]: How about Night Trap?

776
00:52:57,123 --> 00:52:57,783
[SPEAKER_01]: What's her face?

777
00:52:57,803 --> 00:52:58,383
[SPEAKER_01]: Dana Plato?

778
00:52:58,423 --> 00:52:59,624
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know, and she's dead now.

779
00:53:00,084 --> 00:53:00,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

780
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:04,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Raj says, Barney's Hide and Seek for the Sega Genesis.

781
00:53:05,225 --> 00:53:05,585
[SPEAKER_08]: I got one.

782
00:53:05,605 --> 00:53:06,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Spice World.

783
00:53:06,806 --> 00:53:07,426
[SPEAKER_08]: I got one.

784
00:53:07,486 --> 00:53:08,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Spice World's awesome.

785
00:53:09,187 --> 00:53:10,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Non-stop hilarity.

786
00:53:10,927 --> 00:53:13,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Street Fighter 2, the movie, the game.

787
00:53:14,468 --> 00:53:15,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that takes the cake there.

788
00:53:16,069 --> 00:53:16,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

789
00:53:17,789 --> 00:53:19,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Raj says, But But Shaq Fu.

790
00:53:20,259 --> 00:53:20,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Shaq Fu Carnival

791
00:53:45,831 --> 00:53:47,031
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Japanese Language is Cake

792
00:54:17,648 --> 00:54:18,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.

793
00:54:18,228 --> 00:54:18,729
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just teasing.

794
00:54:19,169 --> 00:54:21,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, here's a way you can learn Japanese the fun way.

795
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:22,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, Loki?

796
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:23,411
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the fun way to learn Japanese?

797
00:54:24,331 --> 00:54:26,932
[SPEAKER_06]: This is learn Japanese with Knuckles.

798
00:54:27,252 --> 00:54:28,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Knuckles from the Sonic franchise.

799
00:54:28,893 --> 00:54:30,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you mean the Knuckles on my hand?

800
00:54:30,494 --> 00:54:32,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, if you get the question wrong, pow!

801
00:54:32,275 --> 00:54:32,715
[SPEAKER_06]: I hit you.

802
00:54:33,135 --> 00:54:34,476
[SPEAKER_06]: No, as in Sonic and Knuckles.

803
00:54:34,716 --> 00:54:43,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, they have this homemade RPG called Knuckles in China Land, which I don't understand why it's China Land if you're learning Japanese, but whatever.

804
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:46,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, basically, you can...

805
00:54:48,604 --> 00:55:10,837
[SPEAKER_06]: They have all of the Hiragana and Katakana symbols in there as well as 6000 kanji and you can actually learn using this game and you can find it at www.kicl.info and it's a free download of course and go check it out.

806
00:55:11,358 --> 00:55:11,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

807
00:55:12,721 --> 00:55:14,021
[SPEAKER_06]: The other things, let's see here.

808
00:55:14,261 --> 00:55:17,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, I just have to say Super Pitfall for the NES.

809
00:55:18,102 --> 00:55:19,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Tarnished the Pitfall name.

810
00:55:19,503 --> 00:55:20,603
[SPEAKER_08]: That game is garbage.

811
00:55:20,743 --> 00:55:21,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolute garbage.

812
00:55:23,083 --> 00:55:25,884
[SPEAKER_08]: I got it as a present from a family member who didn't know much about games.

813
00:55:25,924 --> 00:55:26,804
[SPEAKER_08]: It was garbage.

814
00:55:27,264 --> 00:55:32,325
[SPEAKER_01]: How about the Sega CD version of Dragon's Lair that was missing scenes?

815
00:55:33,926 --> 00:55:34,746
[SPEAKER_08]: How about anything on the 3DO?

816
00:55:36,238 --> 00:55:38,319
[SPEAKER_01]: The Zelda game that wasn't a Zelda game.

817
00:55:38,399 --> 00:55:39,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything on the 3DO.

818
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:40,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, didn't 3DO have the racing game?

819
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:42,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, forget it.

820
00:55:42,682 --> 00:55:45,924
[SPEAKER_01]: And was anything on the Jaguar with the exception of Tempest 2000?

821
00:55:46,024 --> 00:55:47,485
[SPEAKER_01]: What was it?

822
00:55:47,505 --> 00:55:49,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Tempest X and Defender 2000.

823
00:55:51,508 --> 00:55:51,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

824
00:55:52,088 --> 00:55:52,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

825
00:55:52,509 --> 00:55:52,849
[SPEAKER_06]: What else?

826
00:55:53,405 --> 00:55:54,546
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple more things real quick.

827
00:55:54,586 --> 00:55:56,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

828
00:55:56,487 --> 00:55:59,049
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just hitting the web right now.

829
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:03,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Multitheft Auto San Andreas 1.0 has finally been released.

830
00:56:03,572 --> 00:56:10,937
[SPEAKER_06]: The PC version of Grand Theft Auto that they've modded to allow multiplayer games in, which I think they should have done from the start.

831
00:56:11,677 --> 00:56:21,544
[SPEAKER_06]: It's available right now if you go to lite.mtavc.com MTA as in Multitheft Auto San Andreas

832
00:56:22,156 --> 00:56:24,878
[SPEAKER_06]: ViceCity.com You can check it out.

833
00:56:26,039 --> 00:56:27,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks like it's going to be pretty good.

834
00:56:28,221 --> 00:56:35,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of mirror servers right now because it's being hammered to death but if it's anything like Multitheft Auto, ViceCity it's going to be amazing.

835
00:56:37,087 --> 00:56:37,488
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah.

836
00:56:38,088 --> 00:56:42,471
[SPEAKER_06]: One last thing of course we've got and we mentioned this before.

837
00:56:42,591 --> 00:56:45,974
[SPEAKER_06]: It's eBay for Animal Crossing.

838
00:56:46,014 --> 00:56:49,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, all those people out there that just really want

839
00:56:50,462 --> 00:56:52,283
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta have the Metroid.

840
00:56:52,383 --> 00:56:53,743
[SPEAKER_08]: I must have the Metroid.

841
00:57:20,572 --> 00:57:21,012
[SPEAKER_06]: It's amazing.

842
00:57:21,132 --> 00:57:21,432
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

843
00:57:22,072 --> 00:57:27,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we're about ready to wrap up the show here, but I have to respond to a chatter real quick because we do have this interactive thing going on.

844
00:57:27,574 --> 00:57:30,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Funny Dale says in the chat room here, I got news for you, Sky.

845
00:57:30,935 --> 00:57:34,656
[SPEAKER_08]: All Pitfall games that came out after the first one have charnished the name of Pitfall.

846
00:57:34,976 --> 00:57:35,436
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no, no.

847
00:57:35,576 --> 00:57:42,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Pitfall 2, the Mayan Caverns on Atari 2600, one of the only Atari 2600 games to feature background music.

848
00:57:42,878 --> 00:57:43,818
[SPEAKER_08]: That game was badass.

849
00:57:44,358 --> 00:57:47,679
[SPEAKER_08]: I enjoy it more than the first one, but the first one is a legendary game.

850
00:57:47,899 --> 00:57:52,920
[SPEAKER_08]: I do love that game a lot, so I have to disagree with you there, but maybe you just forgot, so I'll let it slide.

851
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,500
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, a lot of the other ones that came out after that were garbage, but we'll see.

852
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:59,081
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, that's all I have to say.

853
00:57:59,501 --> 00:58:00,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, any last-minute stories?

854
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:03,461
[SPEAKER_08]: I notice you're ruffling through the pages of the internet right now.

855
00:58:04,161 --> 00:58:07,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, just a little fun little thing here.

856
00:58:07,362 --> 00:58:12,963
[SPEAKER_06]: They have... Everybody loves, you know, the prince from Katamari.

857
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:16,751
[SPEAKER_06]: and now you can make your very own prints to put on your desktop at work.

858
00:58:18,011 --> 00:58:21,773
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a paper model actually you can download and print out and make.

859
00:58:22,273 --> 00:58:38,838
[SPEAKER_06]: It's at fccafe.fc2web.com slash ptamacy.html and go check it out and they've got your own little prints for you.

860
00:58:39,418 --> 00:58:39,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Cute.

861
00:58:40,646 --> 00:58:41,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, it's time to wrap it up.

862
00:58:42,127 --> 00:58:44,728
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we've had ourselves a good show tonight, and I think it's time to end it.

863
00:58:45,108 --> 00:58:46,409
[SPEAKER_08]: So now it's time to get our final thoughts.

864
00:58:46,869 --> 00:58:49,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Next week on the program, everybody, we're going to have an interview.

865
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:51,592
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it is happening for sure next week.

866
00:58:51,692 --> 00:58:52,532
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be awesome.

867
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:57,535
[SPEAKER_08]: We're having a rep from GameTap here, the service that we talked about a couple shows ago.

868
00:58:58,236 --> 00:59:00,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to be talking about GameTap and the plans for the future.

869
00:59:00,417 --> 00:59:01,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Should be awesome, so stay tuned for that.

870
00:59:02,878 --> 00:59:04,099

875
00:59:11,059 --> 00:59:15,822
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is I'm going to actually play through all of Ridge Racer so I can get good to play online.

00:59:17,063 --> 00:59:17,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Ridge Racer 6, of course.

877
00:59:19,625 --> 00:59:26,309
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought is I'm craving to go play some Pitfall 2 very soon because I thought about that game just now with this show and it was so awesome.

878
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:27,350
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.

879
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:30,452
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's another one of those games that look better on the Commodore 64 than it did on Atari, just so you know.

880
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:31,133
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.

881
00:59:31,373 --> 00:59:35,115

[SPEAKER_08]: You have to tell us about it next week.

883
00:59:37,197 --> 00:59:37,417

885
00:59:38,818 --> 00:59:39,078
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

886
00:59:39,795 --> 00:59:42,756
