we appreciate it and of course those you listen on the podcast too we know not

19
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,040
everybody can watch Sunday night because you know some of you guys are watching

20
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,440
what are the big TV shows on Sunday night? Family Guy? Some of you guys are watching

21
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:20,000
Family Guy and the other stuff going out. Don't give them ideas. I know I shouldn't give them ideas

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,280
sorry sorry don't watch Family Guy sucks now it's not as good as the first couple

23
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,280
seasons.

24
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,220
Did she be as brilliant as me and not watch TV?

25
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,560
You know, this is somewhat gaming related.

26
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,180
I'm going to kind of go off on a random tangent, I don't care.

27
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,060
I was watching 24, I only watched the first half, because you know they did this four

28
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,160
hour premiere thing last week, I only watched the first half of it, because that's a lot

29
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,280
of TV, I mean, hooray for DVR.

30
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,040
But I was thinking while I was watching it, the show is so suspenseful and very, I don't

31
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,120
know, like Metal Gear-esque, I'm thinking, gosh, this show would make a great video game

32
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,080
And then I was like, oh yeah, there is a video game.

33
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,680
I remember seeing the trailer at E3, but it's been in development for so long that I believe

34
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,940
the story was supposed to be between seasons two and three.

35
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,940
That's correct.

36
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:07,800
But I don't want to spoil anything, but this show has a tendency to kill off characters

37
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,400
that you really get attached to.

38
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,760
So I think it's very interesting that the game is possibly going to have characters

39
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,800
that have now been killed off.

40
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,680
It's coming out the end of February.

41
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,680
Oh, good.

42
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,460
I really hope it doesn't stink.

43
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,460
It looks good.

44
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:24,500
same writers same the cast is lending their voice and appearance and the

45
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,660
appearances to it sounds good that's good yeah you know it's a good show so

46
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:34,020
I'm thinking it'll be a good game but not as good as games that were out on

47
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,980
the Commodore 64 and I'll tell you what a lot of people say that they grew up on

48
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:43,980
Atari 2600 or they grew up on Nintendo Coleco vision Coleco vision Odyssey

49
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:50,380
whatever was arcades I grew up on the Commodore 64 so Loki what did you find

50
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:54,620
find out in Commodore 64 news believe it or not this um well actually it's

51
00:02:54,620 --> 00:03:00,820
available you can play Commodore 64 games online available through c64 s

52
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,940
dot-com and you can actually check out they have a ton of games on there

53
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:11,180
including commando the great Gianna sisters bubble bubble boulder dash

54
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:18,420
Ghostbusters ghosts and goblins paper boy Bruce Lee boulder dash 2 and blue

55
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,820
Max as the top ten right now. Oh my gosh, I had Blue Max. That's crazy. I had quite a...

56
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,860
Boulder Dash, I had that game too, and of course, Arkon. Yeah. Oh my gosh. What about

57
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:33,400
The Last Ninja? That game was awesome. Um, Spy vs. Spy. What about Spy vs. Spy? Um, tons

58
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,140
of Boulder Dash stuff on here. Bomb Jack. It was a huge title. Commando 2. Yeah. Back

59
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:43,640
to the Future. Outrun. Pitfall in the Commodore 64. Pitfall. You know, a lot of games that

60
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,840
we're on Atari we're on Commodore 64 but with better graphics and that's one of

61
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,440
them and also I'm the one that comes to mind is H-E-R-O which is a game I play a

62
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,580
hell of a lot of on GameTap the graphics on Commodore 64 were way better than the

63
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,540
ones on Atari which kind of makes me sad because they don't have the Commodore version on GameTap.

64
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,040
They have about a hundred games on there.

65
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,340
Awesome. Now you know I gotta ask is this legal?

66
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,340
I don't know. Who cares?

67
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,940
Well I'm okay it's a little bit of a gray area but okay

68
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,780
that's still kinda cool. There were some awesome games on the Commodore 64

69
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,700
but I bet a lot of people are gonna load them up now and go, you know

70
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,140
clunky, bad graphics, but such good memories. Is Beachhead in there?

71
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,060
Beachhead was awesome too. I don't know. Yeah, good times.

72
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,300
Alright. Check that out.

73
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,740
Relive your youth. You know because some of those, of course I checked out

74
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,140
Commodore 64 emulators and they were first like the big

75
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,340
you know things in the emulator scene and a lot of them were just really clunky and

76
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,700
hard to use so I like this idea of having it

77
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,540
much easier and kinda streamline in the website very nice

78
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:50,300
alright let's move on to a very very new game in a very very

79
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,240
popular game in this day and age World of war crack I talked about it earlier in

80
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,900
the show

81
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,100
there's some stuff coming up for what's going on with World of Warcraft, Jamie you

82
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:58,660
first

83
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,140
well I'm actually they're going to be celebrating the

84
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,640
lunar new year in World of Warcraft

85
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,420
it will be between a they'll be

86
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:17,320
There's a celebration, they're saying, as in S-A-L-E, they'll be getting sparkly in

87
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,700
Azeroth on account of the Lunar New Year, is what it says, between January 27th and

88
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:26,540
February 14th, there'll be celebrations focusing on Moonglade, the 29th will also see celebrations

89
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:31,440
in Stormwind, Thunder Bluff, and Booty Bay.

90
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:38,260
And while every capital will be decorated, on February 13th, there will be a fire show

91
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:43,580
of Moonglade paralleling the Chinese Festival of Lanterns, so they'll be a humongous light

92
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,580
show.

93
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:53,980
Gameplay based events going on based on Azeroth's ancestors, quests for holiday items as rewards,

94
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:59,700
tokens that can be redeemed for rockets and fireworks and festival dumplings and different

95
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,420
outfits available for the Lunar Holidays.

96
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,540
Does Blizzard know how to throw a party or what?

97
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,540
Seriously?

98
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,040
They do some fun events.

99
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,400
I saw an interesting response to this though on some message board is that they were saying

100
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,500
that this was a kind of a way for World of Warcraft to kind of appeal to the Chinese

101
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,920
players right now because I guess they did something, I haven't really been following

102
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,920
a lot of WoW drama, but I guess maybe they did something to kind of turn the Chinese

103
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,800
players off when they launched the games there, so they're saying that this is kind of a way

104
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:31,280
to show that, oh we can do, you know, oh maybe it was because of like the more, you know,

105
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,140
U.S. culture events that they did like for the holidays and Halloween and stuff, so maybe

106
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,920
this is a way to kind of show that you know we can do the Chinese events too so

107
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,360
kind of interesting I don't know if that's true or not but it's just an

108
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,320
interesting perspective on that. Loki you have completely different news of the

109
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:53,280
WoW kind. Yes actually what's kind of cool is World of Warcraft has surpassed

110
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,160
their 1 million European player mark so now over a million people playing in

111
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,560
Europe since the launch or that was a you know less than a year ago bringing

112
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:09,160
the total number of subscribers to the game worldwide to about 5.5 million this

113
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:14,280
also just in World of Warcraft will soon be renaming itself to just the world

114
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,400
that was a dot hat joke dot hack joke for those of you guys that didn't get

115
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:26,480
that oh yeah I made a joke haha why this is why I do a podcast out of the spare

116
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:32,560
bedroom of an apartment and I don't do comedy low-key speaking of other things

117
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,800
I can't do one of them is play an Xbox 360 because I still have yet to find one of these little bastards

118
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,560
But that doesn't stop the Xbox 360 news from coming in and holy crap

119
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,200
Do you have a lot of it tonight starting off with Japan? Are they buying them yet?

120
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:54,140
Nope, not buying them in Japan. In fact only about seven thousand four hundred and seventy seven systems have sold there

121
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:01,080
And I think I mentioned last week that they're being beaten out by every other console system out there

122
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,080
which is pretty bad and as far as the US sales go

123
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,080
including Gizmondo, believe it or not, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, including the US sales

124
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,080
you know they've only sold only about 600,000 which is

125
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,080
pretty pitiful. Let's see, now the other thing

126
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,080
that we have here is they were kind of going back and forth on whether they wanted

127
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,080
third party, or not third party, external Blu-ray

128
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,080
or external HD DVD drive, now of course they're backing HD

129
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:34,920
DVD 100% whether, you know, it becomes the format of choice or not.

130
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,840
Wasn't there a little bit of like backtracking this week where it's like, well we might still

131
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,840
do a Blu-ray.

132
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,680
It's kind of like, well wait and see.

133
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,160
Are they committing or what?

134
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,160
They're committing.

135
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,160
Alright.

136
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,240
So, you know, we'll see.

137
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,280
That's kind of, you know, what I'm thinking, but okay.

138
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:58,080
Anyways, the other thing is there's some, they released a list of the top ten online,

139
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,220
Xbox Live arcade games that are out right now and the most downloads that they've had.

140
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,680
To no surprise, number one, Geometry Wars, which is the main reason why a lot of people

141
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,500
are actually getting an Xbox 360.

142
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,100
Screw Call of Duty.

143
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,100
Screw it.

144
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,100
Right in the air.

145
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,100
Call of Duty is fun.

146
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,100
Okay.

147
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,820
Now, Gauntlet, number two, the retro Gauntlet, that surprised me because I thought Smash

148
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,820
TV would have been number two.

149
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,500
Smash TV is number three.

150
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,500
There you go.

151
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,100
Bejeweled 2, number four.

152
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,620
Zuma, number five.

153
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,220
Bankshop Billiards, which is number six.

154
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,040
Correct me if I'm wrong, Zuma and Bejeweled,

155
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,120
two games you can play online for free, right?

156
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,960
Yeah.

157
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,080
Already, okay, just checking.

158
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,440
Do those games offer achievements, though?

159
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,960
Well, all of them do.

160
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,360
That must be why people download it,

161
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,400
because they want to make their Xbox 360 wang bigger.

162
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,240
Exactly.

163
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,240
Let's see, Outpost Colloquy,

164
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,800
which is supposedly a pretty cool sim-type game.

165
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,680
Mutant Storm Reloaded, which is awesome,

166
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,240
I'm surprised it's still down on the bottom of the list there, because it's very similar

167
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,840
to Geometry Wars, uh, Joust, which is kind of an enhanced version of Joust, and then

168
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:11,480
Wick, Fable of Souls, which sucks ass, because I bought that game for, I don't know why,

169
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,840
but it's not very fun.

170
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,800
Well that's why it's the number 10, the bottom spot, because there isn't much more than that

171
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,680
out on Xbox Live right now, is there?

172
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,720
There's a few things, like some card games, but uh, yeah.

173
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,720
Alright.

174
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,720
That's pretty much it for now.

175
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,720
Alright, sounds good.

176
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,720
What else is going on?

177
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:33,320
news, we've got also kind of tying in with the pitiful sales of the 360.

178
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:39,080
GameStop right now they still have 3% of the original November 22nd launch orders that

179
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:43,520
they still haven't filled yet because they're waiting on more Xboxes to come in.

180
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,240
It's a good thing I didn't wait for mine because I could still be waiting right now.

181
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,640
Of course they're getting more units in each week, it's just they're surprised it's taking

182
00:10:53,640 --> 00:11:00,200
so long and they're thinking that the pre-orders will still be there until February.

183
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,080
I'm wondering how many of them are getting canceled because people are finding them through

184
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,080
other means.

185
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,600
There's a lot of people canceling them but even still that's not really affecting anything.

186
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,520
The other thing is there's going to be a major update through Xbox Live.

187
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:18,520
The main feature that's going to be added to it is a webcam feature which you may have

188
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:24,080
seen in the early shots of the 360 they had a webcam type of utility that looked like

189
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,080
an iToy type of thing. That's going to be added and launched at the same time as this

190
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,260
update. Isn't this kind of rumor status still? Or has this been confirmed? No, this has been

191
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:36,840
confirmed that this is going to happen. Right now there are going to be another thing that

192
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:42,320
they are talking about adding later on will be the ability to actually create custom themes

193
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:49,520
for your desktop and stuff or your dashboard and custom gamertag pictures and stuff.

194
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,620
So that's something to look forward to.

195
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,160
It's great that they're working on that end of things, unfortunately they're not working

196
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:03,260
on the end of Backwards Compatibility, which is a pitiful 200 games right now, most of

197
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,280
which you probably wouldn't want to play anyways.

198
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,440
Oh I don't know, Loki, Halo?

199
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,840
will find. Halo and Halo 2, those are the only games right now that are backwards compatible

200
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:20,840
with it that are worth playing, but anyways, those don't actually work 100%, by the way.

201
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,320
But if you're expecting more games to be added, like Microsoft said, they're going to be adding

202
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,100
more and more each week. I think, again, they're taking a vacation. You're not going to see

203
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:34,440
any more updates to the backwards compatibility until about March or April.

204
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,520
hopefully they're taking a vacation down into the factory to build some more

205
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,800
Xbox 360's

206
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,200
it's sad they've only had two updates to the whole

207
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,200
backwards compatibility thing since launch so

208
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,880
it wasn't gonna be a weekly thing so Microsoft learning

209
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,880
to disappoint some comments from learning

210
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,040
you mean they didn't already know well they're perfecting disappointment

211
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,240
some comments from the chat room a wonder dog Harold says don't forget that

212
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,900
Barbie game is backwards compatible

213
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:06,020
Oh, I'm sorry. All the kids want to play that. Reenie has a response to the webcam thing.

214
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:09,560
Hooray for webcams! Let's see people's asses and peni,

215
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,400
which I think is the plural term for, you know,

216
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:18,900
wang. Yeah. www.orangelandradio.com. Click on chat, by the way, to join our chat if

218
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,200
swinging

219
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,880
during the week, too, as well, for those of you guys listening on the podcast, because we do

220
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,740
other live shows here on Orange Land Radio,

221
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,940
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday night, and they're not podcasts. We just don't have the

222
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,820
bandwidth, people.

223
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,780
so you have to listen live if you want to hear it and we play a whole lot of

224
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:37,620
copyrighted music because we can it's all legal through Live 365

225
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,820
our friends and buddies over there at Live 365 who

226
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,500
have been hosting us for so long and taking our money

227
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,780
ah and now for something completely different another way you can

228
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:51,380
interact with our show is not just through chat not just through skype

229
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:56,100
but there's the old email and you send us an email to mailbag at orangelounge

230
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:00,180
radio.com and Jamie she looks in there in the

231
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:06,060
cavernous mailbag and pulls out a few of her favorite emails what you find for us

232
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:11,100

235
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:29,040
ahead and give them a shout out gorilla at three guys three beers calm they do a

236
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:37,680
a podcast um actually wrote in um supporting the mac oh not this again yes this again oh

237
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:43,440
boy i'm going to just uh read a little bit of this if i may is it all i wanted to say

238
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,560
loki suit up abestos i know i know they're gunning for you here all the mac fans are

239
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,680
whatever it's just my opinion i didn't you know let her speak whatever i just like this quote here

240
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,680
Well, if I drive a dump truck at work, does that mean I have to drive one for my own personal car?

241
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,680
In reference to the PC.

242
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,680
Okay.

243
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:09,680
Um, you know, he says Windows has, um, I'm going to read this line here.

244
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,680
So if someone is all about games, yeah, Windows has many more.

245
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,680
If someone is about music, podcasting, graphics, internet pictures, making personal DVDs, movies, Mac is the way to go.

246
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,680
And honestly, I have to agree, I can't wait until I get my Mac.

247
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,300
but he also says he can do

248
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,840
you know a Mac with OS X what he does on his PC and you can

249
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,160
you can actually customize how your Mac works so I fully agree with that

250
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,600
and also just to read up the last full

251
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,360
paragraph in here it's like well said enough once again great show keep it up

252
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,480
I like that just don't talk trash about Macs Logie

253
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,320
talk about jumping to the past Windows looks just as shitty as it did back in the

254
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,960
early nineties can't polish a turd

255
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:57,960
How many PC's out there are running Windows? How many are running Mac OS X?

256
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,960
Yeah, I think so.

257
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:03,960
Oh man, all those features that a Mac can do. Yeah, a PC can do just as well, if not better.

258
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:08,960
So, whatever, you know. It's my opinion. I don't care. You can go ahead and bitch and moan about it.

259
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,960
I will never buy Mac products ever and this includes the iPods, you know.

260
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,960
I'm wondering how actual numbers is opinion. Actual numbers are facts.

261
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,240
I think I went into the mailbag earlier this week and I was looking at random emails.

262
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,240
I don't know if you're going to read this one.

263
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,240
If you are, I'm sorry.

264
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,960
But there was one email that pretty much simply said something like, you know, I'm a Mac user.

265
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,040
Sky, you're cool.

266
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,040
You moderate.

267
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,040
Jamie, you rock.

268
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,040
Loki, fuck you.

269
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,040
Yeah.

270
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,040
I think I forwarded that one.

271
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,440
I really don't care.

272
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,240
Everyone keeps bringing this up to me because they want me to argue about it and I really

273
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,720
don't care if you use a Mac.

274
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,640
I'm never going to use it because I don't buy computers based on flavors.

275
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,480
So alright, moving on.

276
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,880
One of our listeners, Terri wrote in, said, just wanted to say, enjoy your new format,

277
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,880
thank you.

278
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,440
Due to time constraints, it was hard for me to catch your live show.

279
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,120
Combining your podcast and live show works great for me.

280
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,940
Also wanted to mention that I really enjoyed the freeze pop interview.

281
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:04,520
Like Loki, I'm not too into that type of music, but I admit that I did enjoy the song you

282
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,520
played on the podcast.

283
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,000
Keep up the good work and happy 2006.

284
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,880
You also told me to get over my virus.

285
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,980
You know, it's funny, I don't have the same thing I had before, I have a sinus infection

286
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,880
know which I'm taking antibiotics for.

287
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,380
Somebody wrote to my personal email suggesting you take a vitamin.

288
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:25,260
Me take a vitamin!

289
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:30,580
I mentioned that you used to work for GNC, so you're pretty well up on the vitamins.

290
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,380
I thank them for their concern.

291
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:37,340
You attract the fanboys and the bugs.

292
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:52,020
Anyway, also we got an email from Press Start about the comment about Tetris.

293
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,940
In fact the email was labeled Tetris is Great.

294
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,860
Says yes every new console released for all eternity should have some version of Tetris.

295
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,860
Actually rephrased every new console released for all eternity should have the Gameboy version

296
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,100
of Tetris.

297
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:09,880
And also Scorched Earth, because that game is one of the best multiplayer games ever.

298
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:18,440
He also brought up Tetranet, and was pretty sad to find that it's gone.

299
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,440
It's still around somewhere.

300
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,040
One of my friends, somebody who's been on the live show before, before we switched his

301
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:27,680
format, Bugged, he posted in LiveJournal, he said something like, Damn you, OrangeLounge,

302
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:32,380
I was listening to the podcast last week and I started a Tetranet server.

303
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,020
So it's still around somewhere, just you gotta dig deep.

304
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,860
I have tetranet somewhere on my computer.

305
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,860
You only need the program.

306
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,220
Well, I wanted to read this paragraph in the letter.

307
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,220
Sure.

308
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,720
Um, also, now that you have all this time and you don't have to do your show as if you're

309
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:51,100
playing Daytona USA News Topic Checkpoint, time extended, I have a suggestion.

310
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,140
Please have a segment for rarities and or underrated titles.

311
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,860
You mentioned the game Cloud a while back, which was a free download of a student-created

312
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,860
game.

313
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,640
Pretty cool, I never would have discovered it otherwise.

314
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,480
You should devote time for allowing us listeners to discover these hard-to-find gems.

315
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,760
I think as gamers, all of us are bored of the same old urban life extreme sport street

316
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,760
racing game.

317
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,560
That's why we're all such big music fans.

318
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,840
By the way, I am the self-proclaimed guitar hero master.

319
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,840
I have five stars for all but five songs on Expert because it's such a unique gaming experience.

320
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,840
Very cool.

321
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,840
I like that idea about the new segment.

322
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,080
You can come over and unlock all the songs on the game.

323
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,600
Even with the two hours thing, we have a bit of a time concern.

324
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,040
We'll certainly consider it.

325
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,460
One of the best ways that we can keep you guys in touch with what's great out there

326
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,080
and what's new and what's free is email us and let us know and let Jamie sort through

327
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,080
that.

328
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,760
I also received an email from Jeremy who says

329
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,820
You asked about cheat when we changed in the email dress. It actually has already changed. Just the to go still works

330
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:54,560
I'm checking all of them. Yeah, that's why I said I have a whole bunch right now to go through

331
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,700
Also about Dance Dance Revolution supernova. Is it only going to be in the arcades?

332
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,900
Is there any chance of being able to play the new game at home?

333
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,720
There are no arcades near so it'll be pretty hard to play this game

334
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:10,400
Also he loves the new format having twice as much to listen to each week is awesome. Oh, thank you

335
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:15,300
But I I'm sure that it's a matter of time till we see it, but you know

336
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,600
It'll be eventually. I'm sure if it's very popular also one last one

337
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,340
Blaze gamer dude 1212

338
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:31,300
Said I'm started listening to the show about two months ago has to say the things the three of us are amazingly good at what we

339
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,660
do

340
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:37,460
Hugs and please continue to do what you were doing. However, I want to collect Loki. He's a crab

341
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:41,780
Sorry, correct. Loki. He said that the site for the new Xbox Live diamond is

342
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,620
www.xboxlivediamondcard.com and it isn't

343
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,580
After hearing the xboxlivediamond.com site was fake

344
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:58,460
It went to xbox.com and look through the site to get the diamond card site

345
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,860
and it actually is xboxlivediamond.com

346
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,860
Is that still going on?

347
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,860
I guess it's not going on.

348
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,940
Yeah, they're still advertising even on the dashboard for 360.

349
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,940
It's like...

350
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,940
Cool.

351
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,940
Deal.

352
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,940
I haven't gotten my card.

353
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,940
I signed up the first day they had it, so...

354
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,740
Yeah, they'll make those when they make more 360s.

355
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,060
Yeah, I'm sure.

356
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:17,820
A little addition, he also says that for fans of Triple Triad, he found the game online

357
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,340
as Google's Triple Triad Gold.

358
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,860
Alright, very cool.

359
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,220
Did you have the email from the other podcaster that sent us the email?

360
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,220
If not, I can pull it up, because I read it too.

361
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,220
I'm sure I did.

362
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:34,160
cover that okay I actually um received an email from another podcaster sent us

363
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,200
a message and it was from let's say I gotta find it in here somewhere I came

364
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,600
from Godfrey who's over at a gamertag radio his name in that show and they

365
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,000
wanted to tell us about this segment that was going on that they covered in

366
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,780
their latest episode because it was the episode they put out on Martin Luther

367
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:55,840
King jr. day it was their episode 35 and they covered racism in video games and

368
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,940
hip-hop and so I actually went over to listen now just I I don't listen to a

369
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:05,260
lot of gaming podcasts and that's nothing against other gaming podcasters

370
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:08,780
because there are some people out there putting out incredible shows it's just

371
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:12,580
that I want to make sure what we do is fresh and stuff so I try to you know

372
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:17,140
stay away from listening to them a lot plus I still have time but I do try to

373
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,780
catch the occasional one so I was listening to this gamer gamertag radio

374
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:24,420
and I listened their segment I thought it was pretty interesting and I would

375
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:29,940
recommend it. My only thing is that I saw it a little more as a social commentary

376
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,980
than necessarily something about games. They do incorporate games into it because

377
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:40,500
you know the the folks that do this show are other ethnic minorities and they

378
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,800
were kind of talking about that they don't like seeing games like 50 Cent

379
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,660
Bulletproof being representations of the community and kind of being pushed there

380
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:51,340
but they I mean they kind of talked a whole lot about other stuff too. I thought

381
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:56,260
is very good pieces very very smart thing so I'd recommend it certainly and

382
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:03,140
you know there's a lot of minority groups in America and I'm sure feel a

383
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:07,300
little bit underrepresented or stereotyped by video games sometimes I

384
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,900
thought I thought this is a great piece you know I also thought was really good

385
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:14,680
about this show this particular show the girl they have on that show is really

386
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,660
good and she didn't say a whole lot during this segment but when I was kind

387
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:22,760
of surprised because I expected Gamertag Radio to be mostly about Xbox because

388
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,340
you know gamertag but she was the one that brought up Nintendo and she said

389
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,000
you know what that's that's why I like Nintendo because Nintendo they're just

390
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,540
fun they're just they just put out fun games I think you know I tend to agree

391
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:37,000
is that the games I like the best I think about the two greatest games I

392
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,160
played last year luminous and medios were puzzle games that have nothing to

393
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:48,160
do with race color religion sexuality stereotypes nothing it's just fun games

394
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:53,040
and so I the norm for anything out on GameCube I like her a lot you and her

395
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,460
need to get together and do like a girly show because it would be he'll be good

396
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:02,480
but it would be good it would be good so go check that out it's it's good stuff I

397
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,060
think what it was a gamertagradio.com I think check it out search from on

398
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:12,320
iTunes alright let's move on here we're gonna go to another topic and Loki well

399
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:18,140
speaking of some of these games that are an insult to some people 25 to life who

400
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:21,260
Who hasn't 25 to life insulted?

401
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:31,840
Well, let's see, well no, 25 to life the national law enforcement officers memorial fund is

402
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:37,860
calling for a boycott of 25 to life and not because the game sucked and got horrible reviews.

403
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:43,020
But apparently it's because the game promotes killing of cops and all that stuff yada yada

404
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:49,140
Basically, they don't like it because the game really has no plot to it and just promotes

405
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:54,500
killing of cops and killing of gangsters and kill kill kill basic yada yada yada.

406
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,780
Anyways, so that's all you need to know.

407
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:00,620
It's the same reason why, you know, Jack Thompson gets his paintings and a bunch of A Grand

408
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,460
Theft Auto and all those other games out there.

409
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,940
Is there an actual boycott going to happen?

410
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,460
Not likely, in fact, this will probably push sales up.

411
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,620
So way to go.

412
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,100
I don't I know very little about this game

413
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:18,140
What do what else do you know about this game 25th of the life is basically revolves around three characters in the game

414
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:26,380
For some reason there's really hardly any missions to it as far as you know kill 25 cops now kill this kill that you

415
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:29,240
get the play as either cops or gang bangers and

416
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:35,580
Throughout the game and they have multiplayer on it as well. It was supposedly one the

417
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:40,940
the better games coming out in January, all of two that were good that were coming out.

418
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:46,300
Of course, it ended up getting horrible reviews, I believe, if I remember correctly, IGN gave

419
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:51,820
it like a 3.9, I think the highest I've seen for it is like a 5 out of 10, I mean, just

420
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:57,980
really bad, but, because it's, you know, really buggy and stuff, and the graphics suck, and

421
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,980
yada yada yada.

422
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:04,940
Alright, let's move on to a completely different topic, let's try to get to something not offensive,

423
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:08,560
25 to life let's talk about 25 in another aspect there's actually this

424
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,800
website I think they do a podcast to what's up with me plugging all the

425
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,680
other podcasts tonight well that's all right support other independent pod we

426
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,600
do we do support other independent podcast there's one of them being too

427
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:23,600
old to play calm that's the number two too old to play calm a website for

428
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,120
gamers over 25 I thought this was interesting because and and gosh I think

429
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:32,560
we all fit in that category oh wait sorry Loki you're excluded I am 25 24

430
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,560
No, I'm going for it.

431
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,560
Oh my bad.

432
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,560
All right then, I guess, but it's over 25, so...

433
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,560
Well, technically I am over 25 because I'm 25 in a few more days, so...

434
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,560
All right.

435
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,560
Ha!

436
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,560
All right, whatever.

437
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,560
Fine, then you can be in this elite circle.

438
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:48,120
They ran a really interesting piece that was huge on dig.com this week and some of the

439
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:52,960
other sites called The Society of Gaming, and this article starts out, adult gamers

440
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,060
are all the same, right?

441
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,880
Ask any non-gamer and they'll tell you.

442
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,960
We're all a bunch of slackers who never grew up.

443
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,640
This is an excellent tie-in to other controversial stories this week, right?

444
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,320
A bunch of overgrown kids who spend their money on games when there are real ways we

445
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,680
could be spending our money, like on minivans with doors that open by themselves.

446
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:15,100
So anyway, the story goes on, it says, any community tends to define itself in some way,

447
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,240
so perhaps it's time the gaming community does the same.

448
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,360
Gamers are a diverse group, but most fall into one of six categories.

449
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,800
So I'm going to ask you guys which category you think you fit into.

450
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,240
So here we go, here's the six categories.

451
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:37,040
Hardcore gamers, the average one they say is not married, but they say that's rare,

452
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,840
it's just a very small group.

453
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,600
They're just essentially hardcore gamers.

454
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,980
They know their games and gaming the way that doctors know the bones of the body.

455
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:51,380
Hardcore gamers know it all and they're proud of their gaming knowledge.

456
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:54,000
Let's see, we have devoted gamers.

457
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,400
They have the singular obsession, the one game, whatever it may be, like Halo 2, and

458
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:05,760
sometimes devoted players kind of move around a little bit.

459
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,360
And then they have the addict, who is a very dark subset they say of the devoted gamer

460
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:15,000
group, the addict who gets into like one MMORPG and gets addicted to... you know where I'm

461
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
going with this, right?

462
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,400
You know, because Jamie always used to say, addict, whenever we would talk about Final

463
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,120
Fantasy XI.

464
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,160
The pretend hardcore gamer.

465
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:28,320
The pretend hardcore gamers, they do really know a thing true about gaming, but they like

466
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,240
to appear that they know far more than they really do.

467
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,200
You know, I think I read a review of this show that actually said something like that

468
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,200
about it.

469
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,200
No, I'm kidding.

470
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,200
I'm kidding.

471
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,200
Anybody that says that's a bastard person.

472
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,880
And then lastly, it would be casual gamers.

473
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,560
A casual gamer is somebody who likes to game, but it's generally one of many hobbies and

474
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:52,020
is no more important than any of the other ones casual gamers tend to play

475
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:56,440
only those games that get good reviews and sell a lot of copies and lastly I'm

476
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:01,240
sorry almost last the clueless gamer clueless gamers buy a lot of games or

477
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,380
they're not really good at any of them and they give up on them before they

478
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,500
become good these are the gamers who do things that puzzle you make a lot of

479
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,180
mistakes and get pretty frustrated by that but also aren't willing to listen

480
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:15,300
to suggestions or take any time to improve and then lastly the worthless

481
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:22,460
gamer. Cheaters, hackers, de-levelers, punks, jackasses, all that stuff. The people that

482
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:27,460
just go in there to ruin games. The worthless gamer. Which gamer are you? Hardcore, devoted,

483
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:31,780
pretend hardcore, casual, clueless, worthless. Loki.

484
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:37,980
Hardcore and worthless. Why is this? I just, I have to know my game knowledge just for

485
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:42,820
working here and you know, I play a lot of games during the week. Not as much as I used

486
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:48,100
too, but I still play, I always have a game system with me, you know, for the most part.

487
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:53,020
I mean, I drag a 360 to work every day, and I have a PSP with me. Two game systems that

488
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:59,460
work with me all the time, you know, that I play every day. And, I mean, I think that's

489
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,980
pretty hardcore right there. And then, of course, I like to cheat in my games sometimes,

490
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:07,820
because it's fun. It's just a lot of fun. But you don't cheat in MMOs? No, not really.

491
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,780
I don't cheat in MMOs cuz that's too much work. So

492
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:16,660
All right, Dark Sakura the categories just to give me sure hardcore

493
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:21,260
Devoted pretend hardcore casual clueless worthless

494
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,900
I'd say hardcore for the old-school stuff

495
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:28,580
Just because you know my collection, right?

496
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,340
I

497
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:35,260
Totally can't see hardcore devoted pretend hardcore casual clueless worthless

498
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:40,460
I'd say I'm pretty devoted to once I get to playing something cuz I like to finish it

499
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:44,420
I am definitely not I'm not a major cheater. Well, okay

500
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:49,900
I do cheat my way through Silent Hill 3 just because I'm not really playing it for the gameplay

501
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,340
I'm playing it for the story and the sexy beam and

502
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,980
the heza beam

503
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,100
It's a heza beam

504
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,380
but

505
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,380
that's just

506
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:06,260
If it's I like putting in cheat codes to see how the game works to see some of the stuff Matt

507
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:11,300
You know hidden away in it, but I I like a good solid game. I like to get into the gameplay

508
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:16,120
It's on everything I can about the game. So I'm sort of a nerdy

509
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,120
They need my own category nerd gamer

510
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:23,500
You sound a little bit like a cross between hardcore and devoted to me a little bit

511
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,380
I would say I'm kind of somewhere between you know

512
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:30,460
what's weird is that I I think I'm kind of like half devoted half clueless the

513
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:34,860
only reason I say I'm clueless is because I'm notorious for my gaming a

514
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:39,180
DD or I will play one game for like a little bit of time and then I go to

515
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:42,580
something else like I lose interest and I go to something else but when I get

516
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:46,020
devoted into a game I get really devoted to the game and I'd say I'd see in a way

517
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:49,700
I just I just don't think I'm to the line where I can really call myself

518
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:54,380
hardcore I feel that I do know a lot about games and stuff but I just I

519
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:59,420
Realize that there's a whole world out outside of that too. So I don't know if I can really call myself hardcore

520
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:03,420
I'm so I'm somewhere between there because I'd say I'm very devoted to a lot of games, too

521
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:08,180
There's some games that I can never put down but there's other games. I just bounce around a whole awful lot

522
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,140
So I'm somewhere in there

523
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:13,840
So anyway, if you guys want to read the whole article and figure out which one of those you are too old to play

00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,080
Are you the 100th caller?

539
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,000
No, you're the first caller tonight.

540
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
What's on your mind?

541
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Damn, it's Ron.

542
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,820
I was hoping I'd get a free toaster out of this.

543
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,320
We might be able to hook you up with that anyway.

544
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,320
I'll bring you a toaster.

545
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,480
I'll bring you a Hello Kitty toaster.

546
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,080
We'll send you a Linux toaster.

547
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,920
When I come out for Katsu-Kan, I'll bring a Hello Kitty toaster.

548
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:23,400
I'm giving it to my sister at Dark Soccer, I already showed you Linux on a toaster.

549
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,320
I know, I saw it.

550
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,500
First off, I have to ask you, DJ Rama S, what kind of gamer are you?

551
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,600
I'm the casual gamer, okay?

552
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,160
Here's a quick example of the hardcore gamer.

553
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,900
My friend got Kingdom Hearts 2, he beat the game in two weeks.

554
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,900
That's hardcore.

555
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,900
Yes.

556
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:45,360
addiction but does does your other friend like go outside and and you know

557
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,920
hug a tree once in a while actually no well then maybe he's he's addicted I

558
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:54,160
don't know all right enough about your friend though what you what made you

559
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:57,600
want to call in tonight I just want to say what's up how you guys doing and how

560
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,440
much I love to show so far well thank you so much we appreciate the

561
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:05,400
occasional compliment call it's it's good um we're doing good I'd say I say

562
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,760
I'm doing pretty well we doing a lot of venting tonight which is good oh I heard

563
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:13,960
As soon as I got home from the jersey, I jumped onto the stream and I heard Doc Soccer foaming

564
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,800
at the mouth about a Doc Soccer president.

565
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:22,200
What do you think about the whole Flowers for Jack Thompson campaign?

566
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:26,760
I have better things to do with $20.

567
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,260
Let the little maggot run his mouth.

568
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,260
I don't care.

569
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,480
He's not going to stop me from buying the game.

570
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,480
There you go.

571
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,200
You can put the $20 down towards the game.

572
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,880
That's a very good point.

573
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:40,080
And if he somehow makes it that a game is not coming out, don't worry, somebody will

574
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,960
find a way and we'll have it.

575
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,960
Very true.

576
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,960
Very true.

577
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,120
Anything else you want to share with our callers tonight, DJ Rama S?

578
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:53,140
Basically earlier about the whole Jared, Nintendo thing being fat, whatever.

579
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:56,600
Get up, go outside, and play.

580
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,400
Don't you think they blew his quote a little bit out of context, though?

581
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,400
Do you think you really meant it?

582
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,400
It's the media.

583
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,400
It's the media.

584
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,400
They always blow shit out of proportion.

585
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,400
Well, true.

586
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,400
Yeah, I can agree with you there

587
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,800
All right, I just I just let it go and I just do my thing and it's good. All right, sounds good

588
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,840
Rama Rama, thank you so much for the call. We appreciate it. Okay, you got it. Hey, everybody

589
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:21,800
All right. Let's go to another call. Hello. You're on orange launch radio. Oh, hey. Hi, who's this?

590
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:31,800
On the forums, all right, I keep turning down your stream going out

591
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:42,960
I was calling to ask you guys a question since I know that you guys originally started out

592
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:49,480
as really a Bimani music games podcast radio thing.

593
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,160
I wanted to ask what are your favorite songs to DDR2?

594
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:59,160
All right, we'll go ahead and answer that question. We're hearing a little bit of feedback, so I'm going to let you go, but stay tuned.

595
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:03,160
Favorite songs to DDR2 per Keith? What do you think?

596
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,160
We were hearing a little feedback, so we had to let him go, but...

597
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,160
Holik.

598
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,160
Holik?

599
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,160
Yeah, you know Holik's always my warm-up song.

600
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,160
Yeah, good song.

601
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,160
And Superstar.

602
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,160
Good song. Loki?

603
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:17,160
I liked, was it, Movin' On by LNG from Fifth Mix, which is pretty cool.

604
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:22,160
And Rain of Sorrow was pretty cool from Max 2.

605
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,480
My favorite old school song is Oh Nick Please Not So Quick, because you know,

606
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,580
erotic, awesome. Say What You Want, Don't Hate, Don't Hate, that song's awesome.

607
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,920
And my favorite new school song is Skulk by Echo Image

608
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,280
in DDR Ultra Mix 2, because that song is awesome. I love that song. It like totally

609
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,880
breathed new life into DDR. Love it. Let's go to another call, see if we have some luck over here.

610
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,240
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

611
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,960
It's Legend of Zaku, what's up boss? Hello, Zaku, what's on your mind? Hey,

a month ago anyway it's only got 2d x you but I know it's so late

614
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,120
he was so late in the game because I was so poor but I must find the money

615
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:05,400
no we love it we love the poster is so awesome it's hanging here in the studio

616
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,800
it's an in the groove to sign poster it's its hope

617
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,280
if you listen to our old show like the old live show we did

618
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,960
you'll understand why that's hilarious but for now is that go I gotta get to

619
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,320
what I gotta keep a move what what

620
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:19,360
brings you to call tonight? Well, I got 2DX and all.

621
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,880
I'm just trying to break into it. Any advice? Because I just started

622
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,080
playing that, you know, I think a couple weeks ago

623
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:29,200
and so far I've pretty much poured out 9 style to

624
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,520
you know, to its prime. When Zaku, now for those who don't know what Zaku's talking

625
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,520
about, 2DX, because we have a lot of people on the podcast who may not have heard of these

626
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:36,920
games,

627
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,940
2DX is Beat Mania 2DX

628
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:43,520
and it's actually gonna be released here in the US very soon as Beat Mania. In

629
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,360
In fact, I think the cover art is out there on the internet right now.

630
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:53,120
But folks have been importing these games from Japan for years now.

631
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,320
There's a whole lot of these games out in Japan.

632
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,940
It started with third style, don't ask, but it started with third style, and all the way

633
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:04,120
through tenth style now, and supposedly 2DX Red on the way as well, which was eleventh

634
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:07,080
style for lack of a better term.

635
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:10,840
The whole lot of these games out there with a hardcore following, and finally we're going

636
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,680
be getting a version of it here in America soon.

637
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,160
As far as getting started with it, I think the best way to learn, I don't think they

638
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,320
still have this in the newer styles, but in 5th style and 6th style they had what was

639
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,400
called a drill mode and it would show you how to do certain key patterns and of course

640
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,680
the game uses a turntable and white and black keys so you play rhythms and make your own

641
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:35,520
beats and the old 5th and 6th have drill mode which I think is a great way to learn how

642
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,940
to play the game and sometimes it can be really obnoxious because you have to do a lot of

643
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:42,760
repetition but it's really good it gets you really good at the game yeah I think

644
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,960
I should I think I should have gotten that because you know nice all doesn't

645
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,200
really have that much except for beginner mode the only thing I'm trying

646
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,880
to do right now is trying to do the ranking does night style have the mode

647
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,920
where you can practice the song and slow it down like two guys yeah yeah you

648
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,960
could you have those modes where you can actually practice measures in training

649
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,280
mode that's the best way to do it when there's lack of a drill mode take a song

650
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:11,320
You can almost pass pass and slow it down in that mode and work at it because most of beat mania is just hearing the

651
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,640
Rhythms in your head and knowing when to hit the keys and that's really the best way to be good at it, right?

652
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,000
All right

653
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,280
Anything else in your mind exactly? We got to keep it moving, but

654
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:24,800
All right, you know just just saying, you know, just saying what's up and everything. All right, what type of game are you?

655
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:30,440
Basically, I don't think I call myself casual, but I'm on I'm like up there

656
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:37,340
Not hardcore not really casual, but in the middle like devoted pretty much have an open mind on you know many games

657
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,340
So would you say you're devoted?

658
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:44,360
Sort of I mean with DDR. Yes, and with Bahmani also and then you know

659
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:49,480
I also have my first-person shooters in my in my ROMs. Okay, and all the other internet things

660
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:56,080
Yeah, you sound devoted to me. You're devoted. I hear I dub you devoted. All right, Zachary. Thanks so much for the call

661
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,380
Take care. Yeah any comment later?

662
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:03,300
Alright, thank you guys for your calls, we appreciate that, we're going to keep things

663
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:07,140
moving here on Orange Launch Radio tonight, but of course we appreciate the calls as always.

664
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,780
If we have time later in the show, I don't know if we will tonight, but we'll take more

665
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,900
calls a little later.

666
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:16,460
Moving on though, we've got other news, starting off with PlayStation 3 news.

667
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,740
Jamie, you have some news on the PlayStation 3?

668
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:21,820
I do indeed.

669
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:29,620
there's a it has been predicted that by an analyst by the name of even Wilson

670
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:34,660
has predicted that the ps3 will launch in November in North America with a

671
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:42,340
summer launch in Japan followed by a March 2007 European launch so however

672
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:48,500
this conflicts with what a lot of the analysts over here are saying regarding

673
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:55,500
when it's going to be out however he's actually gone on this this analyst has

674
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:00,460
gone on to predict volumes for the system as well he believes that the ps3

675
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:04,160
will have a million units in Japan in summer with similar volumes in the US

676
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:10,060
November and again a similar number in for the European market and that they're

677
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:16,660
basically going to exceed the Xbox 360 all right well we'll see we'll see if it

678
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:20,660
There's a lot of words going back and forth on it'll be out in November, it won't be out in November,

679
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:24,660
but most people seem to be looking at November now, which is a good time to release your system right before Christmas.

680
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,660
Right before.

681
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:30,660
Now, also on the PS3 front, we had some titles get thrown out there earlier this week?

682
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:35,660
There were some titles put out, and then they were sort of pulled back.

683
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,660
Well, what happened?

684
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,660
Let me, hold on a second.

685
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,660
Sure.

686
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:53,660
Okay. Basically, the Japanese Playstation site put up a few links to six games they had up on their site, and then took them down without explanation.

687
00:41:53,660 --> 00:42:01,660
So, was it that they said, huh, maybe we shouldn't put them out and just hope they don't notice?

688
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:14,660
GameIndustry.biz got something out of a Sony spokesperson that said we're working on the launch of the PS3 and confirmed a list of titles that will be announced at the appropriate time.

689
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,660
Hmm.

690
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,660
I guess that wasn't it, was it?

691
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,660
Do you remember what any of those titles were? Sure.

692
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:34,260
According to one of my sources, there was Genji 2, Angel Rings, Monster Carnival, Everybody's

693
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:39,260
Goth 5, Gran Turismo, and Eye of Judgment.

694
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:42,220
Gran Turismo would be a pretty sweet launch title in this country, I know that.

695
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:47,660
Some we do know of though is Metal Gear Solid 4, there was a demo of a Tekken game, and

696
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:50,620
There's still speculation regarding the Final Fantasy franchise.

697
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,580
Very interesting.

698
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:57,100
Also there is in development a version of Unreal Tournament 2007.

699
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,100
Awesome.

700
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:03,140
I also can confirm this, there was another story that ran on joystick.com earlier this

701
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,140
week.

702
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:08,360
Virtua Fighter 5 for PlayStation 3 has been confirmed, and it's actually coming from this

703
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,580
month's issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly.

704
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:16,700
Virtua Fighter 5 is coming to the PS3, and it might be exclusive, and then there's a

705
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,460
sexy little screenshot, but I don't know if that's actually from the game or just something

706
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:22,420
the site put to kind of tag that with, so.

707
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:29,420
But certainly fans of Virtua Fighter, of which I know one, and she's in the room, I thought

708
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:30,420
you liked Virtua Fighter.

709
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:31,420
I loathe Virtua Fighter.

710
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:32,420
Oh wow, okay.

711
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,420
Then I don't know anyone who likes Virtua Fighter.

712
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:34,660
I'm the Tekken fangirl.

713
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:35,660
I know you liked it.

714
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:39,220
I thought for some reason you were also, I get the Sega thing.

715
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:43,760
Virtua Fighter made me gag so much when the first ones were out I was not able to enjoy

716
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,820
the series ever since.

717
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:48,140
I'll tell you what Virtua Fighter made me made me gag Virtua Fighter 2 on the

718
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:48,940
Genesis

719
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:53,940
where they took it and made it 3D. Exactly! Except Virtua Fighter Kids was kinda fun.

720
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:57,620
Alright, let's talk more PlayStation 3. Loki,

721
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:01,500
you have some stories about like there was like a survey going on with PlayStation 3?

722
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:05,580
Yeah, a survey that's been around going around too basically cuz

723
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:09,860
I don't know if anyone's actually played online with the PlayStation 2.

724
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:13,620
It's basically a big clusterfuck of what's going on. They don't really have a

725
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:14,700
system. It just kinda

726
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:19,300
out there and the original idea for Sony for the PlayStation 3 was

727
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:22,620
hey it worked before let's go ahead and do it again and

728
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:25,940
they're kinda looking at that like maybe we should

729
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:29,420
you know come out with something like Xbox Live anyways so the thing that's going around

730
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,820
right now is there

731
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:35,980
about 33 questions or so asking different things like for example some

732
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:37,060
things they hint at

733
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:40,620
a specific lobby only for adults would that be you know something that you'd be

734
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:41,300
interested in

735
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:44,100
with the sexy itoy plugin.

736
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:50,100
Itoy plugin for game lobbies, USB keyboard support,

737
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:53,820
just, you know, all the standard stuff that you pretty much see in Xbox Live.

738
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:57,380
They're asking, hey, you want this? You know, that type of thing.

739
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:01,780
Which, I mean, begs the question, if they're not going to have

740
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:05,140
USB keyboard support, then why the hell do they have so many USB ports on the

741
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:06,500
goddamn thing anyways?

742
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:10,740
That's what I want to know. So, of course they're going to have USB support

743
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:15,380
for the, um, you know, keyboard. So that's something that's kinda like going on right

744
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,860
now on friends lists and whatnot.

745
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:23,100
So, be interesting. Alright now moving on I think this is PlayStation 3 related

746
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,660
something about Pioneer?

747
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:29,060
Yeah, Pioneer, um, the people making the blu-ray player,

748
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:33,320
um, they threw out some crazy numbers for what they thought that the PS3 launch

749
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,020
was gonna be

750
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:38,540
and this I had to laugh. Um, see originally the estimates were, um,

751
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:43,340
1,000,000 units for launch in the United States while Pioneer is saying that they are going

752
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:50,140
to have as many as 7,000,000 units available for launch, right?

753
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:51,440
That's a lot of overtime.

754
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,440
I don't think so.

755
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:58,220
I mean, let's put it this way, unless they're planning on launching in 2009, it ain't going

756
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:59,220
to happen.

757
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,220
We'll see.

758
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:01,220
All right.

759
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:05,500
Moving on to a completely different topic, but this is somewhat PlayStation related,

760
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,980
but it's also Xbox related.

761
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:10,140
homebrew for the PSP that's not Tetris?

762
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:16,760
Yes, this homebrew is actually a port of a PC game which is also a kind of a knock-off

763
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,140
of Geometry Wars.

764
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:24,940
It's vector and vector for the PSP, very similar to Geometry Wars in the way it plays.

765
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:30,820
Of course the control scheme is a little bit not as good as the 360 because you don't have

766
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:35,620
the dual analog on a PSP, but it's really awesome.

767
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:43,820
It's only available though for the 1.5 firmware, so hopefully you've got that or you can downgrade.

768
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:47,960
It's available on your various PSP sites like PSPupdates.

769
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:48,960
Very cool.

770
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,340
So for those folks that can't get your Xbox 360 to play Geometry Wars, maybe this is a

771
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:53,340
good substitute.

772
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:58,940
Exactly, and if for whatever reason you can't get a version for the PSP, remember there's

773
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:05,980
still the PC version of the game which is available at bagfullofwrong.co.uk

774
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:14,940
slash games slash vector.html. Alright now moving on Loki you had some news on

775
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:19,580
Majesco something was going on with Majesco and Majesco is getting out of

776
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:26,320
the hardcore gaming business basically they're not making any more expensive

777
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:30,440
of games except for the budget titles and portable system games.

778
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,520
What big games did Majesco make?

779
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:33,880
I can't even think of any off the top of my head.

780
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,640
I think that the last game that they put out was Aeon Flux.

781
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,160
Well that answers a lot.

782
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,840
They've canned a couple of the games already.

783
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,080
What was in progress?

784
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,280
Taxi Driver and Demonic.

785
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,960
Oh that's right, I remember reading the report on Taxi Driver now.

786
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,160
Yeah, they're not doing too well as far as stuff that's coming out.

787
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:55,920
I know some of their games have been pulled, but it's probably just, they're just looking

788
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:05,640
you know self-preservation so yeah all right speaking of things gone bad I

789
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:09,680
thought this was a very interesting story that ran on one up calm it's a

790
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,560
little bit of a throwback to their you know sister company cuz there's if Davis

791
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:17,480
company and of course if Davis does the electronic gaming monthly magazine and

792
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:21,400
they're counting down to their 200th issue right now OMG and they ran a

793
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:29,320
a report on 1UP.com. What were the worst reviewed games ever in Electronic Gaming Monthly?

794
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:34,600
Oh, Majesco did Psychonauts. Okay, cool. All right, Electronic Gaming Monthly,

795
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:41,320
the worst 10, not the top 10, but the worst 10 games ever reviewed. Batman Beyond, number 10,

796
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:47,640
for the PS1. Who wants to beat up a millionaire on the Dreamcast? That was hilarious. That game

797
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:53,360
was fun got a 1.0 score powerpuff girls paint the townsville green for the game

798
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:58,080
boy color and then right behind that at number seven powerpuff girls bad mojo

799
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:04,400
Jojo also for the game boy color it was also in the same issue kiss pinball for

800
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,760
the PlayStation one was number six remember that the psycho circus game

801
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:15,520
yeah urban champion II which was for the game boy advance for some reason for

802
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,720
For some reason, I think they re-released this on the Advance, it was one of their games they put on the Advance.

803
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,720
Urban Champion, that game sucked balls on Nintendo.

804
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:24,520
It's like Nintendo's little blemish of the 8-bit era.

805
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:27,120
I mean, who remembers Urban Champion?

806
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,520
I mean, like, Hogan's Alley, awesome.

807
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:34,320
Other games, other 8-bit classics made by Nintendo that were forgotten about like that were awesome.

808
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,620
But Urban Champion, easy forgotten.

809
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:39,120
Number four, The Guy Game.

810
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,420
It wasn't that bad.

811
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:41,420
Rebuttal.

812
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:48,200
It was a good trivia game in which you look past all the like really crappy, yeah, topless

813
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:52,220
stuff and, granted, you had to memorize questions, but they did have a mode that like randomized

814
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:54,660
stuff and it wasn't so bad.

815
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:58,660
Number three, Mortal Kombat Advance for the Game Boy Advance.

816
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:01,300
It was pretty poopy.

817
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:07,300
Number two, the number two worst game of all time, according to an EGM list here on 1UP.com.

818
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:10,100
The Flintstones Bedrock Bowling.

819
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:16,140
a reason why I never heard of that game apparently. Here's the number one worst game of all time

820
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:21,980
reviewed on EGM, and it's a game I own, because it was a gift. Ping Pals, for the Gameplay

821
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:27,740
DS, or for the Nintendo DS, was the worst reviewed game of all time. And rightfully

822
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:30,940
so, in many ways, because Ping Pals kind of sucks. Loki, you're shaking your head.

823
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:35,900
No, I think there's a worse game out there, and this is basically the Manos, the Hands

824
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:41,560
of fate for PC games. It's called Big Rigs. If you go to GameSpot.com and look for the

825
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:45,480
review on Big Rigs, the game came out...

826
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,320
Now this is not the same as Big Mother Truckers.

827
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:54,320
No, this isn't the same as Big Mother Truckers. It's a Big Rig racing game and the AI doesn't

828
00:50:55,160 --> 00:51:01,080
move. The other cars don't move, so it's impossible for you to lose a race. The physics aren't

829
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:05,880
there. You fall through bridges. You can drive off the map. There is no limit to your acceleration.

830
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:11,600
So you can hold down and go a million miles an hour and then hold the acceleration down.

831
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,600
It's just an awful game.

832
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,600
There's not many maps.

833
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:17,280
It doesn't really work and crashes all the way through it.

834
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,360
Just watch the review.

835
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,680
It's hilarious.

836
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:20,920
It's one of the worst games of all time.

837
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,160
I think it's gotten like a zero.

838
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,920
I mean it's so awful.

839
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:28,360
I was going to go around and ask what do you think were things that they missed on this

840
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:29,360
list.

841
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:32,960
I was going to say Sprung for the DS which is a game I reviewed on the show half a year

842
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,080
ago probably now at this point.

843
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,080
That game was so awful.

844
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,760
It was so awful, it wasn't even like a game.

845
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,720
Sprung definitely deserves to be in the bottom ten here.

846
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,600
Dark Soccer, any come to mind for you?

847
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:48,160
I haven't really played anything crappy because usually I get my opportunity to, I read up

848
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:52,240
on it before I get it anyway.

849
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,800
I don't think I've played any crap this year.

850
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:59,880
Was there a game that you didn't like that a lot of other people liked?

851
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,000
There were games I thought were overrated.

852
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,600
I mean certainly, I like Ridge Racer a whole bunch, but I thought Ridge Racer 6 was kind

853
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,780
of overrated.

854
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:15,040
I can't say that there's any that I really dislike that I actually played, put effort

855
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,040
into.

856
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,040
Fair enough, fair enough.

857
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,040
Alright.

858
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:22,580
Oh yeah, Smackdown vs. Raw on the PSP because that game annoys the hell out of me.

859
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:28,080
Some comments from the chat room, some folks there are putting in their own two cents here.

860
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:33,440
funny dale says worst game of all time back to the future for the NES

861
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,440
back to the future two and three

862
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,240
E.T. on the twenty six hundred

863
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:42,240
I actually played E.T. on the twenty six hundred when I was like six years old and found it entertaining

864
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,680
but of course I was six years old so you know and the Smurfs on Gleeke's Vision

865
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,440
the Smurfs was badass

866
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:51,680
Hey I love the Smurfs game I played that all the time when I was like four

867
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,740
uh... MagMax on the NES

868
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:57,040
how about Night Trap

869
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:03,920
What's her face? Yeah, I know and she's dead now. Let's see. Um, Raj says Barney's hide-and-seek for the Sega Genesis

870
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:08,600
I got one ice world. I got our spice world's awesome

871
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,720
non-stop

872
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,760
Street fighter to the movie the game. Oh

873
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,520
That takes the cake there. Let's see. Um

874
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,360
Ra says but but Shaq foo

875
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:25,120
That's a very good one. Nint says universal combat was mixed missed on the list there

876
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:29,560
lots and lots of good stuff there oh I know I know one that I cannot stand I

877
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,240
hate this game I think it's the worst game I've ever played it's worse than

878
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:37,080
sprung what pit fighter ah I think was like an Atari game that came out years

879
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:43,080
ago oh my god it's awful it was like they use like live capture stuff it's

880
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:48,120
awful carnival I never played it is a shooting game where you go through like

881
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:52,060
an evil twisted carnival and it was kind of stupid horrible or time killers

882
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:57,040
horrible horrible all right moving on I know a lot of folks there in chat room

883
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:00,580
getting in on that but we need to move on here and we're gonna go over to Loki

884
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:06,200
who's got a story some good some good final stories for us tonight you know I

885
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:09,100
know a lot of you people out there want to learn Japanese and you think you can

886
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:11,960
just sign up for a Japanese class and you know you'll learn it like that it's

887
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:18,480
it's easy stuff right right our Sakura Japanese language is cake I'm just

888
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,480
Well, here's a way you can learn Japanese the fun way, right, Loki?

889
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,440
What's the fun way to learn Japanese?

890
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:27,520
This is learn Japanese with knuckles.

891
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,880
Knuckles from the Sonic franchise, of course.

892
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,560
Oh, you mean the knuckles on my hand?

893
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:33,040
Like if you get the question wrong, pow, I hit you.

894
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,920
No, as in Sonic and Knuckles.

895
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:40,400
Anyways, they have this homemade RPG called Knuckles in China Land, which I don't understand

896
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,640
why it's China Land if you're learning Japanese, but whatever.

897
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:59,640
Basically you can learn, they have all of the hiragana and katakana symbols in there as well as 6000 kanji and you can actually learn using this game.

898
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:07,640
And you can find it at www.kicl.info

899
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:11,640
And it's a free download of course and go check it out. Awesome.

900
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:18,140
Um, the other things, let's see here, wait I just have to say Super Pitfall for the NES.

901
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:23,000
Tarnish the Pitfall name, that game is garbage, absolute garbage.

902
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,280
I got it as a present from like a family member who didn't know much about games, it was garbage.

903
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:32,640
How about the Sega CD version of Dragon's Lair, that was missing scenes?

904
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:36,240
How about anything on the 3DO?

905
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,240
The Zelda game?

906
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,240
That wasn't a Zelda game?

907
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,240
Like anything on the 3DO.

908
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:42,240
Actually, didn't 3DO have the racing game? Well, forget it.

909
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:51,240
And the sitting thing on the Jaguar with the exception of Tempest 2000, well is it Tempest X, and Defender 2000.

910
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:54,240
Alright, okay, what else? A couple more things real quick.

911
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,240
Sure.

912
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,240
This is just hitting the web right now.

913
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:03,240
Multi-Theft Auto San Andreas 1.0 has finally been released.

914
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:08,240
The PC version of Grand Theft Auto that they've modded to allow multiplayer games in,

915
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:11,240
which I think they should have done from the start.

916
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:18,640
It's available right now if you go to lite.mtavc.com

917
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:23,640
MTA as in you know multitheftautovicecity.com

918
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,640
You can check it out.

919
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:27,640
Looks like it's going to be pretty good.

920
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:31,640
Lots of mirror servers right now because it's being hammered to death but

921
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:35,640
if it's anything like multitheftautovicecity it's going to be amazing.

922
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:39,720
So yeah, one last thing of course we've got

923
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:42,780
it's, and we mentioned this before, it's

924
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:47,800
eBay for Animal Crossing. Yes, all those people out there that

925
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:53,160
just really want that rare stuff that you can't find. I gotta have the

926
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:53,880
Metroid.

927
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:57,480
I must have the Metroid. Exactly.

928
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:03,040
Then your answer is nookbay.com. Check it out. You can actually bid on items

Nookbay.com.

933
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,200
So, it's amazing.

934
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,200
All right.

935
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:25,080
Well, we're about ready to wrap up the show here, but I have to respond to a chatter real

936
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,640
quick because, you know, we do have this interactive thing going on.

937
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:31,000
Funnydale says in the chat room here, I got news for you, Sky.

938
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,240
pitfall games that came out after the first one have tarnished the name of

939
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:39,760
pitfall no no no no pitfall to the Mayan caverns on Atari 2600 one of the

940
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:43,960
only Atari 2600 games to feature background music that game was badass I

941
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:48,240
enjoy it more than the first one but the first one is a legendary game I do love

942
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:52,040
that game a lot so I have to disagree with you there but maybe you just forgot

943
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:55,440
so I'll let it slide but yeah a lot of the other ones that came out after that

944
00:57:55,440 --> 00:58:00,400
were garbage but we'll see anyway that's all I have to say Loki any last-minute

945
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,400
I know you're ruffling through the pages of the internet right now.

946
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:06,400
Yeah, well, just a little fun little thing here.

947
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,400
