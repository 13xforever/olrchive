1
00:00:14,148 --> 00:00:18,615
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, January 22nd, 2006, is the Gizmondo and Mondo Trouble.

2
00:00:18,956 --> 00:00:24,945
[SPEAKER_00]: A new Silent Hill trailer hits the net and has everyone buzzing, and we talk about the worst reviewed video games of all time.

3
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,710
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,271
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode number 171.

5
00:00:37,851 --> 00:00:44,712
[SPEAKER_01]: For this, January the 22nd, 2006, we're here to talk about video games and what gamers really want to know about.

6
00:00:44,752 --> 00:00:53,334
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, you know our old catchphrase, the video games that don't suck, but sometimes we have to tell you about the ones that do suck just to tell you to stay away from them.

7
00:00:53,894 --> 00:00:54,734
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Rob Roberts.

8
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:55,634
[SPEAKER_01]: You might know me as Sky.

9
00:00:55,694 --> 00:00:58,155
[SPEAKER_01]: Joining me as always are my lovely co-hosts.

10
00:00:58,635 --> 00:01:00,875
[SPEAKER_01]: Say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

11
00:01:02,481 --> 00:01:03,702
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, your mic's off, dear.

12
00:01:04,242 --> 00:01:05,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it isn't.

13
00:01:05,183 --> 00:01:05,663
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.

14
00:01:06,203 --> 00:01:07,144
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't find the ferret.

15
00:01:07,284 --> 00:01:07,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there he is.

16
00:01:08,124 --> 00:01:09,305
[SPEAKER_03]: I've decided the name of the ferret.

17
00:01:09,905 --> 00:01:13,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Our mascot ferret, which we've had for the past three and a half years now that we've been doing a live show.

18
00:01:14,468 --> 00:01:15,789
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we calling the ferret?

19
00:01:16,249 --> 00:01:17,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Senor Burrito.

20
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Why Senor Burrito?

21
00:01:19,431 --> 00:01:19,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Because.

22
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:22,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a chatroom influence thing?

23
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:24,233
[SPEAKER_03]: No, his name is Senor Burrito.

24
00:01:24,393 --> 00:01:25,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

25
00:01:26,475 --> 00:01:29,837
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't mean to step on Senor Burrito over there.

26
00:01:31,423 --> 00:01:33,964
[SPEAKER_01]: Say hello to Senor Taco over there in the corner.

27
00:01:34,044 --> 00:01:34,424
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki!

28
00:01:34,884 --> 00:01:36,164
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not Senor Taco.

29
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,245
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not like tacos.

30
00:01:38,745 --> 00:01:39,085
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?

31
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:40,846
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, Senor McDonald's.

32
00:01:42,066 --> 00:01:43,486
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what this is.

33
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:45,507
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not food, that's for sure.

34
00:01:46,687 --> 00:01:47,948
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I don't feel bad eating it.

35
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:51,269
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I can't get fat off of it because it's not actually food.

36
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:53,229
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like toxic waste in buns.

37
00:01:53,389 --> 00:01:54,730
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, that will make your ass big.

38
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,650
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.

39
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you have a wedding to prepare for?

40
00:01:58,751 --> 00:01:58,831
[SPEAKER_03]: I am.

41
00:02:00,836 --> 00:02:01,416
[SPEAKER_01]: Game Over.

42
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:06,498
[SPEAKER_01]: We're here taping live on this Sunday evening.

43
00:02:06,558 --> 00:02:15,280
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, if you've been living in a cave and you missed last week's show, we do now tape our podcast live on Sunday nights to allow our listeners to interact with us.

44
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:20,201
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can interact with us by heading on over to our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

47
00:02:25,423 --> 00:02:29,664
[SPEAKER_01]: Our mailbag is mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

48
00:02:31,106 --> 00:02:31,486
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.

49
00:02:31,506 --> 00:02:31,946
[SPEAKER_01]: Send us an email.

50
00:02:31,966 --> 00:02:33,207
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get to the mailbag a little later.

51
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:35,127
[SPEAKER_01]: But first, let's get to the games.

52
00:02:36,628 --> 00:02:38,668
[SPEAKER_01]: And talk about how our gaming weeks were.

53
00:02:38,688 --> 00:02:40,109
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's how we start things off here.

54
00:02:40,189 --> 00:02:40,669
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura.

55
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:42,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Mine was special.

56
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:43,770
[SPEAKER_04]: As in not very.

57
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,532
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually went, made it to school this week.

58
00:02:50,552 --> 00:02:52,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I actually sort of started school.

59
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:56,653
[SPEAKER_04]: And someone was in there playing puppies.

60
00:02:58,134 --> 00:02:58,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Playing...

61
00:02:59,451 --> 00:03:01,532
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

62
00:03:26,335 --> 00:03:33,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever happened to your friend that was like hardcore in Nintendogs that I met at your bachelorette party and she had like the Dalmatian and everything.

63
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:34,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Melchon.

64
00:03:34,818 --> 00:03:35,018
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

65
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:40,200
[SPEAKER_04]: I think she's still playing with her puppies, but she's Dan's assistant manager.

66
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,380
[SPEAKER_01]: That game just got old, I'm sorry to say.

67
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,841
[SPEAKER_04]: She's playing with the villagers too, with her village people.

68
00:03:46,422 --> 00:03:47,562
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they all doing the YMCA?

69
00:03:48,084 --> 00:03:51,065
[SPEAKER_04]: No, mine are doing the migrate out of DarkSakura's town right now.

70
00:03:51,185 --> 00:03:53,025
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine are doing the let's go pick weeds.

71
00:03:53,365 --> 00:04:00,687
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually harassing Limburg right now for all of his Japanese stuff in his house because I'm remaking the Shrine to Fire.

72
00:04:01,447 --> 00:04:04,187
[SPEAKER_01]: You know the best way to get people to move out of your town on Animal Crossing?

73
00:04:04,788 --> 00:04:05,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Leave a lot?

74
00:04:05,508 --> 00:04:06,388
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't talk to them.

75
00:04:06,908 --> 00:04:07,148
[SPEAKER_01]: Ever.

76
00:04:07,528 --> 00:04:09,509
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they leave because they feel ignored.

77
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:10,089
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.

78
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:16,410
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't it sad that we're talking about a fake town on a fake video game?

79
00:04:17,631 --> 00:04:17,831
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

80
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,932
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet, people have these real social interactions.

81
00:04:20,972 --> 00:04:21,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, forget it.

82
00:04:22,592 --> 00:04:23,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else to share?

83
00:04:23,372 --> 00:04:24,832
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

84
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:25,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki.

85
00:04:26,313 --> 00:04:26,893
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes?

86
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:29,413
[SPEAKER_01]: Your gaming week, you played anything?

87
00:04:29,693 --> 00:04:31,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I did play.

88
00:04:31,334 --> 00:04:33,594
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually got to play a little bit more of my 360.

89
00:04:33,914 --> 00:04:38,355
[SPEAKER_02]: I was playing Ridge Racer this morning, and I love that game.

90
00:04:39,015 --> 00:04:41,175
[SPEAKER_02]: It plays exactly like every other Ridge Racer game.

91
00:04:42,056 --> 00:04:43,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably because they haven't really changed much in it.

92
00:04:44,315 --> 00:04:47,237
[SPEAKER_02]: But it looks good, and I got through quite a bit.

93
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:50,860
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to find the right car, you know, because each car kind of handles a little bit differently.

94
00:04:51,381 --> 00:04:57,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I finally found my right car for it, and now I'm kicking ass.

95
00:04:58,786 --> 00:05:03,350
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do like the fact they've had actually more downloads for it now, so there's more cars.

96
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:09,235
[SPEAKER_02]: And I purchased some of the music that I liked from the other games, because you can download that as well, because it costs money.

97
00:05:09,915 --> 00:05:10,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Boo.

98
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:10,716
[SPEAKER_02]: But

99
00:05:11,192 --> 00:05:11,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I did that anyways.

100
00:05:12,537 --> 00:05:17,534
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also played a little bit of Final Fantasy XI for the 360 because they have the beta now that you can get with

101
00:05:19,613 --> 00:05:25,075
[SPEAKER_01]: I was listening to other podcasts where folks were getting the Final Fantasy XI.

102
00:05:25,095 --> 00:05:27,456
[SPEAKER_01]: It was taking them like three hours to install it.

103
00:05:28,056 --> 00:05:29,957
[SPEAKER_01]: I had memories of the PC version.

104
00:05:30,317 --> 00:05:31,457
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, guess what, guys?

105
00:05:31,477 --> 00:05:35,538
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's something you may not know for those of you that are getting on the 360 for the first time that weren't doing the PC.

106
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:43,461
[SPEAKER_01]: Expect those three-hour patches like once every two months because they'll change something big in the game and then everybody tries to patch at the same time.

107
00:05:44,415 --> 00:05:50,336
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to say, I don't want to start a whole MMO debate, but World of Warcraft has their patching down.

108
00:05:50,356 --> 00:05:53,757
[SPEAKER_01]: The way they do it, because they use peer-to-peer to do it, it's smooth.

109
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:56,517
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never had a patching problem on World of Warcraft, but Final Fantasy XI?

110
00:05:58,038 --> 00:05:59,298
[SPEAKER_01]: Nightmares.

111
00:06:00,578 --> 00:06:07,780
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing that I would say that's pretty good about this is that the actual screens and the play-on-line stuff is really quick.

112
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,360
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really quick.

113
00:06:10,715 --> 00:06:11,996
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

114
00:06:39,122 --> 00:06:41,923
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh, they're going to letterbox it for regular TVs?

115
00:06:42,303 --> 00:06:43,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it's going to be letterboxed.

116
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:48,266
[SPEAKER_01]: That chat dialogue is going to be horrible trying to read that stuff on a regular TV.

117
00:06:48,646 --> 00:06:53,028
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to have to buy a USB keyboard in order to play this thing.

118
00:06:53,328 --> 00:06:55,869
[SPEAKER_02]: It's near impossible to play it without it.

119
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,211
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's the same story with the PlayStation 2.

120
00:06:59,271 --> 00:07:00,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Does any old USB keyboard work?

121
00:07:01,011 --> 00:07:01,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, pretty much.

122
00:07:01,852 --> 00:07:02,912
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not going to be a problem for most people.

123
00:07:02,932 --> 00:07:04,333
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a big problem, but...

124
00:07:05,495 --> 00:07:07,858
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing, I tried playing it a little bit this morning.

125
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:11,742
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't really level up at all because there's a ton of new people starting.

126
00:07:11,902 --> 00:07:16,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, this is like an entirely brand new server that they're testing it on right now, so everybody's like level one.

127
00:07:17,568 --> 00:07:21,672
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, imagine all the rabbits in the very beginning of the game.

128
00:07:22,213 --> 00:07:23,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Camp the hell.

129
00:07:23,354 --> 00:07:26,177
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's like no way to get anything.

130
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,042
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of sucks.

131
00:07:29,322 --> 00:07:32,366
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a brand new game for every region, right?

132
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:38,495
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when Final Fantasy XI launched in the US, we were hooked up automatically with the Japanese servers.

133
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:41,118
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is just a beta test server right now.

134
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:42,681
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I...

135
00:07:43,408 --> 00:07:49,090
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first played Final Fantasy XI, I bought Final Fantasy XI on launch day for the PC when it first came out years ago.

136
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,671
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't remember that being a problem.

137
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:56,013
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, at the same time, I didn't know what the hell I was doing in that game because that game just kind of throws you into it.

138
00:07:56,093 --> 00:08:00,795
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have a very excellent tutorial with it, so you just kind of have to jump in and get going.

139
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:04,356
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I didn't even know to kill rabbits for a couple days.

140
00:08:04,376 --> 00:08:06,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember how long I was going through WTF mode in that game?

141
00:08:07,137 --> 00:08:07,477
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

142
00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:08,998
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, I miss...

143
00:08:10,445 --> 00:08:11,845
[SPEAKER_04]: I miss Ragnarok already.

144
00:08:34,861 --> 00:08:36,582
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

145
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:55,131
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com.

146
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:11,126
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to have to have Xbox Live and play online to play it.

147
00:09:11,146 --> 00:09:12,888
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to be paying two fees.

148
00:09:13,148 --> 00:09:13,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily.

149
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:16,611
[SPEAKER_02]: You only need silver to play this.

150
00:09:17,111 --> 00:09:19,153
[SPEAKER_02]: So you only have to really pay one fee.

151
00:09:19,553 --> 00:09:22,115
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm already paying for Xbox Live Gold.

152
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,958
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell do I need to be paying another fee for?

153
00:09:26,939 --> 00:09:28,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I'm not picking this up when this comes out.

154
00:09:28,961 --> 00:09:29,822
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't care.

155
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,344
[SPEAKER_02]: In the expansion, it's not going to be a big deal.

156
00:09:32,964 --> 00:09:36,307
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they've done with it so far, I thought this was supposed to be the...

157
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:38,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Big huge thing.

158
00:09:38,819 --> 00:09:41,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, look, it's an MMO coming to the Xbox.

159
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, it's going to be amazing.

160
00:09:42,801 --> 00:09:43,781
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not amazed at all.

161
00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:46,182
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even impressed a little bit.

162
00:09:46,822 --> 00:09:52,244
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks just like a PC game, I mean the PC version, and it has not improved in any way whatsoever.

163
00:09:52,784 --> 00:10:05,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, do you think someone like me or someone like Jamie who has a widescreen HDTV of a larger size than any computer monitor sitting in their living room, do you think we might benefit from it a little more because we'll have a better...

164
00:10:06,685 --> 00:10:08,086
[SPEAKER_01]: Better visual to handle it.

165
00:10:08,586 --> 00:10:09,486
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

166
00:10:09,747 --> 00:10:11,447
[SPEAKER_02]: The textures, like I said, aren't improved.

167
00:10:11,968 --> 00:10:15,309
[SPEAKER_02]: If anything, it's going to be a little bit blurrier for you guys, but that's about it.

168
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember what I say, though.

169
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:18,011
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

170
00:10:18,471 --> 00:10:19,391
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about the gameplay.

171
00:10:20,132 --> 00:10:23,773
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still Final Fantasy XI, and it still has crap for gameplay.

172
00:10:24,994 --> 00:10:28,716
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to sit here and bash XI totally, unlike Jamie, because it was a lot.

173
00:10:28,756 --> 00:10:30,877
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Final Fantasy XI for like two years, okay?

174
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:35,519
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot to really like about the game, and I suppose that I can at least applaud...

175
00:10:36,394 --> 00:10:39,416
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather see, and as much as I really hate Phantasy Star Online, I'd rather see that on this.

176
00:10:59,206 --> 00:11:04,710
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't even gotten far enough yet to see if there's any lag anywhere, but I'm not impressed and I'm not going to be picking it up when it comes out.

177
00:11:24,986 --> 00:11:26,347
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

178
00:11:49,471 --> 00:11:49,911
[SPEAKER_02]: You can dream.

179
00:11:50,692 --> 00:11:57,337
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, assuming all goes well, I should actually have my Kingdom Hearts very, very soon.

180
00:11:57,657 --> 00:11:58,798
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you importing the one from Japan?

181
00:11:59,679 --> 00:11:59,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

182
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:00,620
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet.

183
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:02,101
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

184
00:12:02,862 --> 00:12:04,663
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've also got my US one on pre-order.

185
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:05,323
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.

186
00:12:07,105 --> 00:12:09,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else that you're playing this week, Loki?

187
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:11,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Grand Theft Auto.

188
00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:14,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories because...

189
00:12:15,953 --> 00:12:16,933
[SPEAKER_02]: I just can't get enough of that game.

190
00:12:16,973 --> 00:12:18,934
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been playing all the deathmatches again.

191
00:12:19,014 --> 00:12:33,038
[SPEAKER_02]: We're actually kind of playing now with the cheat device a little bit because one of the things you can do with the cheat device is manipulate the gravity in the game and it'll actually, you can unload the cheat device and launch a multiplayer game with the gravity in place.

192
00:12:33,698 --> 00:12:41,760
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, for instance, could have like .1 gravity and other people could be, you know, having just normal gravity and I'll jump way the fuck over them.

193
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,181
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of fun.

194
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:44,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

195
00:12:45,285 --> 00:12:47,066
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

196
00:13:05,433 --> 00:13:07,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Mega Man X4 was kind of cool.

197
00:13:07,075 --> 00:13:07,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, no, I'm sorry.

198
00:13:07,655 --> 00:13:08,096
[SPEAKER_01]: 5 and 6.

199
00:13:08,376 --> 00:13:08,456
[SPEAKER_01]: X4.

200
00:13:09,217 --> 00:13:10,278
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the last one?

201
00:13:10,318 --> 00:13:11,820
[SPEAKER_01]: X4 had the sucker in it.

202
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I take it back.

203
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,142
[SPEAKER_01]: X5 and X6 kind of sucked.

204
00:13:14,422 --> 00:13:16,104
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I'm like, well, X1 was kind of cool.

205
00:13:16,144 --> 00:13:18,787
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I really want to pay all this again just to play, you know, X1?

206
00:13:18,807 --> 00:13:19,187
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

207
00:13:19,247 --> 00:13:25,554
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to get Mega Man X1, get Mega Man Powered Up or Maverick Hunter X, the remake for the PSP.

208
00:13:26,034 --> 00:13:26,675
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like 20 bucks.

209
00:13:27,356 --> 00:13:27,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that out now?

210
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:28,797
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

211
00:13:29,172 --> 00:13:31,673
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's coming out the first week in February

212
00:13:58,632 --> 00:13:59,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Battle and Chase

213
00:14:22,788 --> 00:14:23,748
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe somebody in chat knows.

214
00:14:23,789 --> 00:14:27,150
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of chat, chat has some feedback to what we've been talking about so far.

215
00:14:28,091 --> 00:14:31,052
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, Jaded2006 had a comment on Nintendogs.

216
00:14:31,372 --> 00:14:34,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendogs died because nobody wanted another Pet Rock.

217
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:37,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of true there.

218
00:14:38,796 --> 00:14:39,636
[SPEAKER_01]: Another point here.

219
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody made a point on Phantasy Star Online.

220
00:14:43,018 --> 00:14:44,418
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was Rini.

221
00:14:44,778 --> 00:14:50,641
[SPEAKER_01]: Rini said, Loki, don't forget, even Phantasy Star Online charges you per month as well on top of the Xbox Live fees.

222
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,442
[SPEAKER_01]: At least the regular Xbox version does.

223
00:14:53,376 --> 00:14:57,758
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the one good thing about this whole silver and gold thing that I see is that now we won't have that anymore.

224
00:14:57,778 --> 00:15:00,039
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that was my complaint about PSO on the Xbox too.

225
00:15:00,439 --> 00:15:03,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is too bad because PSO on the Xbox is my favorite version.

226
00:15:04,441 --> 00:15:07,442
[SPEAKER_01]: I did like the one on PC a whole lot, but Xbox had voice chat.

227
00:15:07,462 --> 00:15:07,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on.

228
00:15:09,483 --> 00:15:11,924
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess you could use team speak and stuff with a PC, but I don't know.

229
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:14,225
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something about having it all streamlined.

230
00:15:14,265 --> 00:15:18,267
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping that there's going to be an MMO coming out that's actually...

231
00:15:19,042 --> 00:15:22,444
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when you pay for gold, it's basically the same fee.

232
00:15:23,085 --> 00:15:23,865
[SPEAKER_02]: It's applied to it.

233
00:15:24,026 --> 00:15:25,687
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't have to pay these extra fees.

234
00:15:27,568 --> 00:15:29,910
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, anyway, if you want to join our chatroom, moronsontrader.com, click on chat.

235
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:43,279
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of MMOs, one other game I've been playing this week, a lot more World of Warcraft, because Miklatov, who was here on the show last week, convinced me to come back after my little hiatus, so I've been playing on his server, and I did our first instance.

236
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,882
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think that's what you call it when you do the dungeon with party, but it's not high level.

237
00:15:47,902 --> 00:15:48,603
[SPEAKER_01]: We're only like level...

238
00:15:49,195 --> 00:15:52,596
[SPEAKER_01]: I think about 16, 17 and we're doing like a low level dungeon.

239
00:15:52,636 --> 00:15:54,056
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they call it an instance still.

240
00:15:54,376 --> 00:15:54,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

241
00:15:54,556 --> 00:15:56,476
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's like a harder quest.

242
00:15:56,716 --> 00:15:57,616
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually a lot of fun.

243
00:15:57,716 --> 00:16:01,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the reason they're called instances is because each dungeon is loaded up for just your party.

244
00:16:01,937 --> 00:16:02,897
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought so.

245
00:16:03,537 --> 00:16:08,078
[SPEAKER_01]: See, somebody was trying to tell me that was only in Guild Wars that that happened and that's true.

246
00:16:08,138 --> 00:16:18,360
[SPEAKER_01]: Guild Wars does that too but yeah, I realized that because none of the creatures were respawning when we were going through the dungeon and I was like maybe this is like just for us when we go through in that

247
00:16:19,013 --> 00:16:21,034
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to talk to those people

248
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:45,382
[SPEAKER_01]: My roommate showed me how to block out the general chat.

249
00:16:45,442 --> 00:16:46,923
[SPEAKER_01]: GH, please.

250
00:16:46,983 --> 00:16:49,466
[SPEAKER_01]: No, in this one, they're all shouting for instances.

251
00:16:49,766 --> 00:16:52,268
[SPEAKER_01]: WC party, need healer.

252
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:54,310
[SPEAKER_01]: RFC party, need healer.

253
00:16:56,392 --> 00:16:59,055
[SPEAKER_01]: So now everybody knows I'm horde on some server because those are horde quests.

254
00:17:00,396 --> 00:17:04,080
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, let's get into tonight's news, shall we?

255
00:17:04,807 --> 00:17:05,027
[SPEAKER_01]: Gizmondo

256
00:17:18,098 --> 00:17:35,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it looks like Tiger Telematics, which is the parent company handling Gizmondo, stated that they've offered the stock IP and patents of SmartAds subsidiary as an equity on a $21.2 million loan from their shareholders.

257
00:17:37,066 --> 00:17:37,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Oopsie!

258
00:17:37,826 --> 00:17:39,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-oh.

259
00:17:39,627 --> 00:17:41,308
[SPEAKER_02]: You mean the ad service wasn't a hit?

260
00:17:42,088 --> 00:17:53,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, basically the terms of the deal, the loan that was overdue to be repaid, and also just for our UK listeners, that's 12.68 million pounds.

261
00:17:54,752 --> 00:17:55,572
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what this is like?

262
00:17:56,212 --> 00:18:01,053
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like friends of mine who have been in very bad financial situations that have to sell their car to pay the rent.

263
00:18:01,674 --> 00:18:02,994
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of what this sounds like to me.

264
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:15,715
[SPEAKER_04]: The catch on this one is that the loan has to be repaid by March 30th unless Tiger can raise $75 million in new equity or debt by that date.

265
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the company says it's working on securing that.

266
00:18:20,418 --> 00:18:30,384
[SPEAKER_04]: If it can get the $75 million, then $1.68 million of the loan must be repaid immediately and the remainder to come before June 30th.

267
00:18:31,565 --> 00:18:37,269
[SPEAKER_04]: and if the company doesn't get it or can't repaid it, the two shareholders will be taking over the smart ad system.

268
00:18:38,349 --> 00:18:39,450
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what could save this company?

269
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:39,890
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

270
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,711
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same thing that saved other companies.

271
00:18:42,051 --> 00:18:42,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Side talking.

272
00:18:45,073 --> 00:18:48,055
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have something additional in this?

273
00:18:48,155 --> 00:18:49,256
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't.

274
00:18:49,276 --> 00:18:52,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing additional other than I'm not surprised.

275
00:18:53,418 --> 00:18:54,719
[SPEAKER_01]: They tried.

276
00:18:54,819 --> 00:18:55,520
[SPEAKER_01]: They really tried.

277
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did the Gizmondo fail?

278
00:18:57,321 --> 00:18:59,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did the Betamax fail?

279
00:19:01,275 --> 00:19:06,982
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the Gizmondo failed because they didn't really have any big name games to kind of draw us to the system.

280
00:19:07,002 --> 00:19:09,666
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the system's only as good as the games that are on it, right?

281
00:19:09,746 --> 00:19:13,151
[SPEAKER_01]: And we saw this one game, Johnny, whatever, that looked, you know, whatever.

282
00:19:13,211 --> 00:19:13,711
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked okay.

283
00:19:14,072 --> 00:19:16,595
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was no big draw.

284
00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:18,198
[SPEAKER_01]: But it wasn't a big draw, you know what I mean?

285
00:19:18,778 --> 00:19:25,943
[SPEAKER_01]: and I never once, walking into a large store like Best Buy, Fry's, never once have I seen a setup for Gizmondo.

286
00:19:26,003 --> 00:19:32,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Gizmondo, the problem with it also was the games that were launching on it were last generation games.

287
00:19:33,328 --> 00:19:38,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, they had this wonderful ad service in there where you have to watch ads in order to shut your system off.

288
00:19:38,672 --> 00:19:39,552
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I remember that.

289
00:19:39,592 --> 00:19:40,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's fun.

290
00:19:40,473 --> 00:19:44,656
[SPEAKER_02]: And also possibly talking about a redesign of the system before the system launches.

291
00:19:44,836 --> 00:19:45,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's a great idea.

292
00:19:45,857 --> 00:19:47,238
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll get people to buy your system.

293
00:19:47,258 --> 00:19:47,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

294
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:50,171
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

295
00:19:51,151 --> 00:19:54,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess... At least their system came out.

296
00:19:54,372 --> 00:19:57,053
[SPEAKER_01]: That's more than we could say about the... About the Phantom?

297
00:19:57,293 --> 00:19:57,893
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

298
00:19:58,553 --> 00:20:01,654
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's not over till it's over, but, you know, it's over.

299
00:20:04,255 --> 00:20:05,315
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving on, other stories.

300
00:20:05,335 --> 00:20:16,719
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a story here about the 9th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, because, you know, it's awards season, and there's, you know, this group, the Interactive Achievement Awards, they're handing out awards, and...

301
00:20:17,443 --> 00:20:19,103
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what's nominated for Game of the Year.

302
00:20:19,223 --> 00:20:26,125
[SPEAKER_01]: God of War, Guitar Hero, Shadow of the Colossus, Call of Duty 2, and Nintendogs.

303
00:20:26,785 --> 00:20:28,426
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what else is missing from this list?

304
00:20:30,026 --> 00:20:32,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Resident Evil 4, which is getting a lot of awards.

305
00:20:32,787 --> 00:20:33,547
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of interesting.

306
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:38,708
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know, maybe it missed the eligibility point or something because Resident Evil 4 came out really, really early in 2005.

307
00:20:38,868 --> 00:20:41,849
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe it just narrowly missed some type of eligibility window.

308
00:20:41,869 --> 00:20:42,169
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

309
00:20:42,763 --> 00:20:49,629
[SPEAKER_01]: Computer Games nominated, Fear, Civilization 4, Battlefield 2, Age of Empires 3, and the movies.

310
00:20:50,369 --> 00:20:52,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a whole, whole lot of categories here.

311
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,092
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm obviously not going to sit here and read them all.

312
00:20:54,412 --> 00:20:57,314
[SPEAKER_01]: But I thought it was interesting because they have a cellular game of the year.

313
00:20:57,675 --> 00:21:00,597
[SPEAKER_01]: And nobody really ever talks about cell phone games because most of them suck.

314
00:21:01,778 --> 00:21:05,281
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to, you know, this might clue you into what a couple of the good ones are.

315
00:21:05,661 --> 00:21:12,146
[SPEAKER_01]: Mile High Pinball, Skipping Stone, 1, Ancient Empires 2, and High Seas.

316
00:21:12,628 --> 00:21:14,810
[SPEAKER_01]: None of which I've ever heard of on my cell phone.

317
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:18,653
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have Sprint, and they have, like, different games than the other people, I think.

318
00:21:18,793 --> 00:21:19,714
[SPEAKER_04]: I always delete them.

319
00:21:19,954 --> 00:21:21,875
[SPEAKER_04]: I, like, have Bejeweled on my phone or something.

320
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:24,818
[SPEAKER_01]: I had Bejeweled multiplayer for a little while, and it was all right.

321
00:21:25,438 --> 00:21:35,206
[SPEAKER_01]: I had Castlevania on the cell phone, which was cool for, like, five minutes, because it was like, dude, it's just like Castlevania 1, but then you realize I'm trying to play a game on my cell phone, and the action is, like, so choppy.

322
00:21:35,686 --> 00:21:36,567
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty bad.

323
00:21:37,968 --> 00:21:41,451
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those things, like, I got this to listen to the theme music once in a while.

324
00:21:41,631 --> 00:21:41,931
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

325
00:21:43,018 --> 00:21:43,479
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what else

326
00:22:03,553 --> 00:22:04,854
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

327
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:26,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably making sure they have enough units out there and maybe launching on time for everyone.

328
00:22:27,171 --> 00:22:33,133
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what's interesting is that I seem to remember that was a big part of their talk behind that controller.

329
00:22:33,213 --> 00:22:40,575
[SPEAKER_01]: When they first showed the pictures of the Revolution controller, they were like, hey, everybody's used a TV remote, so this makes it kind of accessible to everybody.

330
00:22:40,816 --> 00:22:41,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

331
00:22:41,596 --> 00:22:42,356
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting argument.

332
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:48,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that way it's so anybody, you know, your grandma can go pick up this game and figure out how to do this, okay?

333
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:49,640
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

334
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:23,927
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how they think they're going to win the next-gen... Did he say anything about actually putting out Twilight Princess this year?

335
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:25,387
[SPEAKER_01]: That should be one of their goals, I think.

336
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:29,329
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you noticed all has been kind of quiet on the Twilight Princess front?

337
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:30,990
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that's just... It's still coming out.

338
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,950
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still kind of... Because we're in a quiet period right now.

339
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,471
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a slow news period right now.

340
00:23:35,371 --> 00:23:35,812
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know.

341
00:23:35,852 --> 00:23:36,412
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just... What?

342
00:23:36,452 --> 00:23:37,272
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're laughing over there.

343
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:38,673
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm laughing at the book reference.

344
00:23:39,053 --> 00:23:39,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.

345
00:23:40,674 --> 00:23:41,494
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to read that.

346
00:23:42,142 --> 00:23:54,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, but no, I think that at the point that they start being very quiet about something that either means one of two things, something is going very well or something is going horrendously wrong.

347
00:23:54,508 --> 00:23:58,130
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think is the case in the PlayStation 3, which has also been very, very quiet lately?

348
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:58,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Horribly wrong.

349
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:05,293
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got theories on this one, but my comments on that are coming up on later issues.

350
00:24:05,433 --> 00:24:05,873
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, fine.

351
00:24:06,313 --> 00:24:09,775
[SPEAKER_02]: My thing is I think they're starting to get towards the end here.

352
00:24:10,368 --> 00:24:36,092
[SPEAKER_02]: they're starting to get towards their dates that they said that they were going to hit and they're nowhere near hitting those dates and I think that it's a bad sign right now seeing as that none of the actual alpha kits have gone out for the PS3 and so far we haven't yet to see an actual playable demo or anything that's actually running well we've seen some demos running on the hardware but nothing playable and the fact that

353
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:37,874
[SPEAKER_02]: The beta kits aren't even out.

354
00:24:38,194 --> 00:24:39,596
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing's nowhere near production.

355
00:24:39,776 --> 00:24:40,777
[SPEAKER_02]: No one knows what the cost is.

356
00:24:40,857 --> 00:24:41,878
[SPEAKER_02]: No one knows when it's coming out.

357
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,340
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even sure it's coming out this year.

358
00:24:45,502 --> 00:24:47,884
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting feedback here from SSJ100 Matt.

359
00:24:47,924 --> 00:24:49,626
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendo's stocks are up 6%.

360
00:24:50,386 --> 00:24:58,813
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do remember reading an article on this is that after there was that big spiel about Nintendo, the revolution will not be above this price, the stocks went up.

361
00:24:59,114 --> 00:25:00,775
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember reading somewhere on the internet.

362
00:25:00,955 --> 00:25:04,378
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think the story made the cut for tonight, but I remember seeing that somewhere on the internet.

363
00:25:04,398 --> 00:25:05,459
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was kind of neat.

364
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:11,764
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if they're going to be able to do under $299, but let's just say they do $199, that thing's going to fly off shelves.

365
00:25:11,964 --> 00:25:12,545
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be...

366
00:25:13,382 --> 00:25:14,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

367
00:25:34,278 --> 00:25:34,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Speculation

368
00:25:55,848 --> 00:25:57,229
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on.

369
00:26:16,503 --> 00:26:18,105
[SPEAKER_02]: A Nintendo DS game is usually about $35.

370
00:26:18,925 --> 00:26:21,388
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say about $35 is as high as I've seen it, too.

371
00:26:21,588 --> 00:26:25,872
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what I paid for... Oh, hell.

372
00:26:27,853 --> 00:26:28,234
[SPEAKER_01]: Kirby!

373
00:26:28,894 --> 00:26:31,697
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, not Kirby, because that was a present.

374
00:26:31,777 --> 00:26:32,798
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's something I bought that was $35.

375
00:26:33,218 --> 00:26:35,420
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd probably touch and go when I first bought it.

376
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,641
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I got it confused.

377
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:37,442
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same game.

378
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:38,703
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just Kirby's a lot better.

379
00:26:39,704 --> 00:26:39,864
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

380
00:26:40,425 --> 00:26:40,665
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

381
00:26:41,325 --> 00:26:41,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving on.

382
00:26:42,896 --> 00:26:44,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, a follow-up to something we talked about last week.

383
00:26:44,898 --> 00:26:50,761
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about this Nintendo DS redesign was on the way, and there's going to be this whole great announcement on Monday.

384
00:26:50,781 --> 00:26:51,841
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what happened, Loki?

385
00:26:52,022 --> 00:26:53,082
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened on Monday?

386
00:26:53,162 --> 00:26:55,083
[SPEAKER_02]: The only announcement was that there's not a redesign.

387
00:26:55,103 --> 00:26:58,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, they didn't say there wasn't going to be a redesign, so... Ever.

388
00:26:58,725 --> 00:27:00,226
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't say there wasn't going to be a redesign, ever.

389
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:07,330
[SPEAKER_02]: They basically said, we have no news to... Basically, our system is awesome.

390
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:10,332
[SPEAKER_02]: We have no news regarding redesigns.

391
00:27:11,445 --> 00:27:13,507
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, but we have nothing to announce at this time.

392
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:15,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing to announce at this time.

393
00:27:15,848 --> 00:27:19,710
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the key word, meaning that there is going to be a redesign, just not right now.

394
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably something that they'll save for E3 or...

395
00:27:23,372 --> 00:27:24,373
[SPEAKER_02]: There is going to be a redesign.

396
00:27:24,553 --> 00:27:27,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo cannot stand to leave something alone.

397
00:27:27,275 --> 00:27:28,977
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always going to be a redesign.

398
00:27:29,297 --> 00:27:29,677
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

399
00:27:29,717 --> 00:27:34,861
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen great, great arguments out there on the internet, though, when people were debunking this.

400
00:27:34,881 --> 00:27:37,964
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know, if it's not broke, why fix it?

401
00:27:38,064 --> 00:27:39,785
[SPEAKER_01]: DSs are still selling like hell.

402
00:27:39,865 --> 00:27:47,972
[SPEAKER_01]: And somebody else sent me an article that also didn't make the cut for tonight, but talking about how the Japanese are really, really pushing to get DSs back on shelves.

403
00:27:47,992 --> 00:27:52,215
[SPEAKER_01]: They're even importing them back in the country and just crazy stuff, you know.

404
00:27:52,893 --> 00:27:54,173
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's not broke, why fix it?

405
00:27:54,313 --> 00:27:58,495
[SPEAKER_01]: They won't need to put out a new DS until DS sales slow down.

406
00:27:59,035 --> 00:28:03,496
[SPEAKER_01]: Which, as long as they keep putting out really solid games for it, probably isn't going to happen anytime soon.

407
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:08,037
[SPEAKER_01]: With Tetris DS right around the corner, I think that's going to be a big motivator for more systems.

408
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:12,619
[SPEAKER_01]: All they would have to do to make more of those systems fly off the shelves, shoot, do another $20 price cut.

409
00:28:13,179 --> 00:28:18,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Tetris DS and you also have the same month is going to be Metroid Prime Hunters.

410
00:28:18,681 --> 00:28:20,241
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a huge month for DS.

411
00:28:21,246 --> 00:28:22,646
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's PSP got on the horizon?

412
00:28:22,886 --> 00:28:23,967
[SPEAKER_02]: What's PSP have?

413
00:28:24,467 --> 00:28:26,427
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the new Splinter Cell Essentials.

414
00:28:26,627 --> 00:28:27,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Katamari Damacy, I suppose.

415
00:28:28,048 --> 00:28:29,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Katamari's coming out in March.

416
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:38,711
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got a new... I'm trying to think if there's anything else that was really... They have a lot of... There's 29 games for the PSP coming out in March.

417
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,471
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, that's a lot of stuff.

418
00:28:41,892 --> 00:28:47,713
[SPEAKER_01]: But... You know, speaking of DS, it's not on the outline for tonight's show, but you had something about Phoenix Wright.

419
00:28:48,573 --> 00:28:48,813
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

420
00:28:48,833 --> 00:28:49,274
[SPEAKER_01]: The DS game.

421
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:49,974
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened with this?

422
00:28:50,414 --> 00:28:50,654
[SPEAKER_01]: Another...

423
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,321
[SPEAKER_01]: Too popular for its own good?

424
00:28:52,521 --> 00:28:54,082
[SPEAKER_02]: It is too popular for its own good.

425
00:28:54,222 --> 00:29:00,147
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, if you don't have one right now and there are none in your local store, you're not going to be seeing it until March.

426
00:29:00,707 --> 00:29:05,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, like most Japanese games, they get produced in Japan.

427
00:29:05,291 --> 00:29:10,355
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a six-week turnaround time because Capcom is sold out of them right now.

428
00:29:10,855 --> 00:29:14,798
[SPEAKER_02]: And no way you can get one until March.

429
00:29:15,639 --> 00:29:15,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

430
00:29:16,199 --> 00:29:17,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, February, March-ish.

431
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:19,002
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, wow, wow.

432
00:29:19,022 --> 00:29:19,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy.

433
00:29:19,162 --> 00:29:19,382
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy.

434
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,300
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

435
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:24,081
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, enough about what's going on in Japan and over here in the U.S.

436
00:29:24,121 --> 00:29:25,902
[SPEAKER_01]: How about our buddies over in the U.K.?

437
00:29:26,022 --> 00:29:32,844
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura likes to keep tabs on what's going on overseas the other way and fills us in with the U.K.

438
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:33,284
[SPEAKER_01]: report.

439
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:38,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we actually have an update that the U.K.

440
00:29:39,406 --> 00:29:40,827
[SPEAKER_04]: DS sales reached $1 million.

441
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:51,167
[SPEAKER_04]: They have surpassed that 1 million unit sale, which is pretty big since it's been out less than a year over there.

442
00:29:54,450 --> 00:30:02,837
[SPEAKER_04]: They said that several of the major retailers in the UK were completely sold out of the systems too, and so people have to wait for quite a while.

443
00:30:03,878 --> 00:30:08,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Worldwide sales are a good bit higher than 13 million now.

444
00:30:10,834 --> 00:30:13,658
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, Nintendo just knows how to do their handhelds.

445
00:30:13,718 --> 00:30:14,198
[SPEAKER_01]: What can you say?

446
00:30:14,859 --> 00:30:15,740
[SPEAKER_04]: They are the pros.

447
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:21,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Dead or Alive 4 has a UK release date.

448
00:30:22,048 --> 00:30:25,472
[SPEAKER_04]: They said it will ship on January 27th.

449
00:30:25,613 --> 00:30:28,136
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you guys that need your boobie fix, it's on its way.

450
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:36,006
[SPEAKER_04]: I warn you, the whole reaction system in that, that game's a pain in the ass.

451
00:30:36,206 --> 00:30:37,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

452
00:30:37,807 --> 00:30:40,069
[SPEAKER_04]: The last boss is the biggest cheese ball in the universe.

453
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:43,492
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to mention something real quick about DOA 4 that makes no sense to me.

454
00:30:43,752 --> 00:30:55,142
[SPEAKER_02]: I was playing that game, and there was one cutscene that they have where one of the female characters is trying to buy a head of lettuce, and this other female character

455
00:30:56,533 --> 00:31:00,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Who seemed to be of royalty or something, took the lettuce away from her, and then they fought.

456
00:31:01,255 --> 00:31:03,096
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell is that for a story?

457
00:31:03,376 --> 00:31:05,476
[SPEAKER_02]: They're fighting over a goddamn head of lettuce.

458
00:31:05,817 --> 00:31:06,917
[SPEAKER_02]: That was so retarded.

459
00:31:07,117 --> 00:31:10,038
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way, their boobs pout way too much in this game still.

460
00:31:10,178 --> 00:31:11,199
[SPEAKER_02]: On the next Jerry Springer.

461
00:31:11,939 --> 00:31:13,439
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you have to set the age.

462
00:31:13,479 --> 00:31:16,020
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got the age set to 30, I think.

463
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:17,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Because of Dan.

464
00:31:18,746 --> 00:31:19,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Bouncy Boobies

465
00:31:43,382 --> 00:31:45,463
[SPEAKER_01]: So your age determines the bounce.

466
00:31:45,584 --> 00:31:46,984
[SPEAKER_01]: That's weird.

467
00:31:47,525 --> 00:31:50,307
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else in the U.K.?

468
00:31:50,747 --> 00:31:53,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, actually, a game I'm actually pretty excited about.

469
00:31:53,529 --> 00:32:01,875
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I might be doing something regarding a translation of this game for the U.S., but that's another story.

470
00:32:02,735 --> 00:32:09,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Tales of Phantasia, a Japanese RPG, is going to be out on the Game Boy in March in the U.K.,

471
00:32:10,876 --> 00:32:17,245
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm actually pretty excited about that game because Tales of Phantasia has a pretty unique battle system.

472
00:32:18,047 --> 00:32:20,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen a bit of it in action, the Japanese version.

473
00:32:20,831 --> 00:32:21,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty cool intro, too.

474
00:32:22,453 --> 00:32:22,633
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

475
00:32:25,025 --> 00:32:27,667
[SPEAKER_04]: It was out on the Super Famicom back in the day.

476
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:30,689
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, was it Tales of Symphonia?

477
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:38,996
[SPEAKER_04]: And another game, one on PlayStation 2 and the other on GameCube, came out in the United States, but we never did see Tales of Fantasia.

478
00:32:41,117 --> 00:32:45,100
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's pretty exciting that there's going to be a release for that on the Game Boy Advance.

479
00:32:45,561 --> 00:32:47,242
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, it's going to be out in Europe at the end of March.

480
00:32:47,702 --> 00:32:48,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

481
00:32:48,423 --> 00:32:51,505
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the United States sometime beginning of March.

482
00:32:52,086 --> 00:32:52,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

483
00:32:53,663 --> 00:32:55,364
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, thank you for that, DarkSakura.

484
00:32:55,524 --> 00:32:56,144
[SPEAKER_02]: You're quite welcome.

485
00:32:56,504 --> 00:32:58,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Our folks overseas appreciate you.

486
00:32:58,645 --> 00:32:59,105
[SPEAKER_05]: They better.

487
00:32:59,325 --> 00:33:00,085
[SPEAKER_01]: They better appreciate you, too.

488
00:33:00,105 --> 00:33:00,585
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I love you guys.

489
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:01,385
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

490
00:33:02,086 --> 00:33:09,028
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, interesting comment here in the chat room, summing up the Dead or Alive 4 story that Loki was telling us about.

491
00:33:09,348 --> 00:33:11,969
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkTetsuya says, DOA 4 has a story?

492
00:33:13,229 --> 00:33:15,910
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I think perfectly sums it up right there.

493
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:18,731
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about John Lee's ending, which is hilarious.

494
00:33:20,714 --> 00:33:21,355
[SPEAKER_01]: Blink, Blink, Blink

495
00:33:33,493 --> 00:33:33,853
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Sudoku 3x3 Box

496
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:56,389
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this huge puzzle craze.

497
00:33:56,669 --> 00:34:02,191
[SPEAKER_01]: So, of course, they think, hmm, puzzle, Game Boy Advance, Tetris, best-selling game.

498
00:34:02,511 --> 00:34:04,252
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, shit, we need to put Sudoku out there.

499
00:34:04,352 --> 00:34:07,353
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Dr. Sudoku is coming out in February.

500
00:34:07,413 --> 00:34:09,874
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got more than 1,000 puzzles.

501
00:34:10,494 --> 00:34:20,658
[SPEAKER_01]: And, of course, will be the first of many, many Sudoku games to hit various game systems, just like Tetris, just like World Championship poker games and all that stuff.

502
00:34:21,779 --> 00:34:22,339
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think?

503
00:34:22,959 --> 00:34:24,260
[SPEAKER_01]: Next big thing, or...

504
00:34:24,895 --> 00:34:25,755
[SPEAKER_01]: Just whatever.

505
00:34:26,476 --> 00:34:28,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe if I ignore it, it'll go away.

506
00:34:29,497 --> 00:34:30,157
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what's interesting?

507
00:34:30,517 --> 00:34:37,580
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand the sudden interest in Sudoku because these puzzle books that they've sold in stores... I remember these from when I was younger.

508
00:34:38,121 --> 00:34:44,743
[SPEAKER_01]: I was such a nerd that my parents could buy me one of these books and we would go on a road trip and I'd shut up for a long time.

509
00:34:45,364 --> 00:34:45,464
[SPEAKER_01]: And...

510
00:34:46,681 --> 00:34:49,683
[SPEAKER_01]: These Sudoku puzzles appeared in the books.

511
00:34:49,723 --> 00:34:53,064
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say it's like Penny Press or somebody puts out these books.

512
00:34:53,144 --> 00:34:54,105
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get them in supermarkets.

513
00:34:54,445 --> 00:34:57,867
[SPEAKER_01]: These Sudoku puzzles appeared in these books a long time ago except they were called something else.

514
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,227
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something with a more English title.

515
00:34:59,307 --> 00:35:02,409
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like crypto numbers or something was like the name of the puzzles.

516
00:35:03,009 --> 00:35:05,751
[SPEAKER_01]: And why now is this stuff all the rage?

517
00:35:05,791 --> 00:35:07,131
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm not getting.

518
00:35:07,231 --> 00:35:08,252
[SPEAKER_01]: People are trend whores.

519
00:35:08,932 --> 00:35:11,253
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, but it's just really weird.

520
00:35:11,713 --> 00:35:14,134
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll admit, I've done a couple Sudoku puzzles.

521
00:35:14,834 --> 00:35:19,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Recently I was in a waiting room for a long time and I was like, there's the New York Times, and I was like, oh, Sudoku.

522
00:35:20,376 --> 00:35:21,076
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do the puzzle there.

523
00:35:23,117 --> 00:35:23,557
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know.

524
00:35:23,797 --> 00:35:26,478
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't see myself spending money to buy this on Game Boy Advance.

525
00:35:26,998 --> 00:35:31,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think its popularity is a good thing because it's something that encourages people to actually use their brains.

526
00:35:32,419 --> 00:35:33,200
[SPEAKER_01]: True, true.

527
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,140
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I don't know.

528
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:37,061
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, to me...

529
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:42,931
[SPEAKER_01]: Game Boy Advance wouldn't match for me just the pen and paper version of doing it, you know?

530
00:35:43,792 --> 00:35:45,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine that, having fun with pen and paper.

531
00:35:46,814 --> 00:35:50,938
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's a strange concept for some gamer folks, but, you know, go figure.

532
00:35:52,739 --> 00:35:56,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, there are people who have actually forgotten how to write from typing so much.

533
00:35:57,523 --> 00:35:57,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

534
00:35:58,404 --> 00:36:06,170
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually is a sort of epidemic thing in Japan where people have forgotten how to write certain kanji because when you type, you can select it from a list.

535
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:06,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.

536
00:36:08,925 --> 00:36:09,485
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting comment.

537
00:36:09,505 --> 00:36:11,787
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm reading chat room for some comments on Sudoku.

538
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:15,330
[SPEAKER_01]: Rini says that Dr. Sudoku will be a battery drainer.

539
00:36:16,471 --> 00:36:16,871
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

540
00:36:18,712 --> 00:36:22,315
[SPEAKER_01]: Ninst says it's the rage now because someone slapped a foreign word on it.

541
00:36:22,395 --> 00:36:23,216
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, whores.

542
00:36:23,596 --> 00:36:24,857
[SPEAKER_01]: And Xander C has the same thing.

543
00:36:25,137 --> 00:36:27,519
[SPEAKER_01]: It's popular now because it has the Japanese name now.

544
00:36:27,859 --> 00:36:31,702
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, WonderDogHerald says they should have a Pokemon Sudoku game.

545
00:36:33,584 --> 00:36:35,025
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how they sold Tetris Attack.

546
00:36:36,258 --> 00:36:41,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody bought Tetris Attack when it was, well, a couple of people did, but not a lot of people bought Tetris Attack when it was first out and had Yoshi and stuff.

547
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:45,182
[SPEAKER_01]: Slap some Pokemon characters on it, put it on the N64, Pokemon Puzzle League.

548
00:36:45,282 --> 00:36:49,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that why Tetris DS has the Retro Mario and Zelda characters in it?

549
00:36:50,464 --> 00:36:50,885
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably.

550
00:36:51,425 --> 00:36:51,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably.

551
00:36:52,365 --> 00:36:56,587
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, we have VXJasonXV, our lovely webmaster.

552
00:36:56,607 --> 00:36:57,047
[SPEAKER_01]: We love him.

553
00:36:57,087 --> 00:36:59,108
[SPEAKER_01]: And chat says, you can't erase paper.

554
00:36:59,788 --> 00:37:00,769
[SPEAKER_01]: Get an eraser mate.

555
00:37:00,809 --> 00:37:02,029
[SPEAKER_01]: Get one of those eraser mate pens.

556
00:37:02,229 --> 00:37:03,110
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't erase paper.

557
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:05,543
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, what's going on in the movie world?

558
00:37:05,563 --> 00:37:06,843
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, uh...

559
00:37:22,916 --> 00:37:24,177
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, House of the Dead 2?

560
00:37:25,138 --> 00:37:25,278
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

561
00:37:25,298 --> 00:37:26,519
[SPEAKER_01]: They're making a House of the Dead 2?

562
00:37:27,139 --> 00:37:28,660
[SPEAKER_02]: That was exactly my reaction.

563
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Dear God, why?

564
00:37:30,141 --> 00:37:37,266
[SPEAKER_02]: When I saw it on our list of movies, you know, upcoming movies, I was like, why the hell would they make a sequel to that?

565
00:37:37,366 --> 00:37:39,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't they lose enough money on the first one?

566
00:37:39,267 --> 00:37:40,548
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not Yui Bol this time.

567
00:37:40,628 --> 00:37:41,329
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not Yui Bol.

568
00:37:41,389 --> 00:37:42,089
[SPEAKER_02]: So it might be good.

569
00:37:42,589 --> 00:37:42,790
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

570
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:45,011
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be that rare sequel that's better than the original.

571
00:37:45,351 --> 00:37:49,554
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to remember, it's not just the director that ruins a movie, okay?

572
00:37:49,914 --> 00:37:51,596
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the same writers as the...

573
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:55,291
[SPEAKER_02]: All in the Dark, and House of the Dead in this one.

574
00:37:55,571 --> 00:38:01,133
[SPEAKER_02]: What's also scary is these same writers are doing a Dead or Alive movie, as if you couldn't tell that one was going to suck.

575
00:38:02,554 --> 00:38:10,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, what's great, though, is this movie, it says it picks up where the last film left off, where the government operatives investigate the island and the mysterious house.

576
00:38:11,537 --> 00:38:16,179
[SPEAKER_02]: So, in other words, the first game, because the last one was a prequel to

577
00:38:16,846 --> 00:38:17,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything.

578
00:38:17,606 --> 00:38:21,448
[SPEAKER_01]: So is that like Jurassic Park 2 when they went back to the island to research the dinosaurs?

579
00:38:21,488 --> 00:38:22,028
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

580
00:38:22,268 --> 00:38:25,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they going to whip out keyboards and have letters pop up in front of the zombies?

581
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:27,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Is Julianne Moore going to be in it?

582
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:31,152
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not Julianne Moore, but you have Sticky Fingers is going to be in it.

583
00:38:31,172 --> 00:38:31,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God.

584
00:38:33,146 --> 00:38:35,668
[SPEAKER_04]: I just hope it has some of the cheeseball dialogue that was in the game.

585
00:38:35,989 --> 00:38:37,430
[SPEAKER_04]: There was nothing we could do.

586
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me put it this way, folks.

587
00:38:39,732 --> 00:38:41,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not buy this when it comes out on DVD.

588
00:38:41,774 --> 00:38:45,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, you can watch it for free when it premieres on SyFy on February 11th.

589
00:38:45,898 --> 00:38:47,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but it won't have titty on SyFy.

590
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's not going to have titty anyways, probably.

591
00:38:51,303 --> 00:38:52,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, actually, no.

592
00:38:52,524 --> 00:38:53,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Nudity and brief sexuality.

593
00:38:54,566 --> 00:38:57,769
[SPEAKER_02]: No nudity in the SyFy version, but really, are you missing anything?

594
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:58,250
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you're not.

595
00:38:58,846 --> 00:39:01,448
[SPEAKER_01]: But it might be one of those movies that's so bad it's good.

596
00:39:02,028 --> 00:39:03,810
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Blood Rain?

597
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:06,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Showgirls, one of my favorite movies of all time.

598
00:39:07,272 --> 00:39:09,093
[SPEAKER_01]: So bad, it's good.

599
00:39:09,994 --> 00:39:14,077
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you watch it on VH1, it's even worse because they draw the bras on and everything.

600
00:39:14,417 --> 00:39:16,839
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Showgirls because it's so, so bad.

601
00:39:17,539 --> 00:39:18,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, you don't know shit.

602
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,422
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are masochist when it comes to actually...

603
00:39:23,343 --> 00:39:24,524
[SPEAKER_02]: You're watching these movies.

604
00:39:24,564 --> 00:39:33,327
[SPEAKER_02]: The DVD will be released in the United States on March 21st, as well as also debuting on Sci-Fi Channel on February 11th.

605
00:39:33,407 --> 00:39:34,488
[SPEAKER_02]: So, check it out.

606
00:39:34,768 --> 00:39:36,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let me set my TiVo now.

607
00:39:37,769 --> 00:39:39,570
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about a more promising movie, shall we?

608
00:39:40,365 --> 00:39:42,486
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about Silent Hill.

609
00:39:42,506 --> 00:39:47,367
[SPEAKER_01]: The trailer hit the internet this week and it's getting really good reaction.

610
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:48,768
[SPEAKER_04]: I've already made two icons from it.

611
00:39:49,668 --> 00:39:54,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you seen the Silent Hill website now is updated and changed?

612
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:55,570
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks awesome.

613
00:39:55,590 --> 00:40:02,573
[SPEAKER_01]: They did this whole flash thing with it where it looks all nice at first and it goes creepy on you all of a sudden and they got cool backdrops and stuff.

614
00:40:02,613 --> 00:40:03,853
[SPEAKER_01]: It's welcome to SilentHill.com.

615
00:40:04,133 --> 00:40:05,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you guys all watch the trailer?

616
00:40:05,974 --> 00:40:06,134
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

617
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:06,714
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you think?

618
00:40:06,994 --> 00:40:08,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I did as I made two icons out of it.

619
00:40:09,175 --> 00:40:09,675
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to ask.

620
00:40:09,895 --> 00:40:11,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Pyramid Head

621
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:28,921
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great because it seems like it really is going to be a great video game adaptation.

622
00:40:28,961 --> 00:40:30,562
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys paid attention to the games.

623
00:40:30,942 --> 00:40:41,786
[SPEAKER_01]: And granted, the story's a lot different, but we kind of have the characters from Silent Hill 1 in a way, some of that, or the ambience of Silent Hill 1 and the music.

624
00:40:42,086 --> 00:40:46,387
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of the characters from Silent Hill 2, and then kind of the look of Silent Hill 3.

625
00:40:46,908 --> 00:40:50,929
[SPEAKER_01]: Towards the end of the trailer, it looks a lot like Silent Hill 3, so it's kind of got all of that.

626
00:40:51,434 --> 00:41:19,428
[SPEAKER_01]: no signs of Silent Hill 4 but I suppose they want to leave room for a sequel or something who knows but the cool thing I thought about the trailer was that they used music from the games in the trailer and we heard that you know Akira was going to do Akira Yamaoka was going to do the soundtrack then he wasn't then some other guy was going to do it and it was going to be inspired by Akira Yamaoka's original score so I don't know if this is some of the score that's actually going to be in the movie but this is it this is great because somebody just basically re-recorded what Akira Yamaoka did it's awesome it fits the trailer very well

627
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:25,379
[SPEAKER_04]: He said he was going to be using elements from the original, so I think that's more where we got a lot of that from.

628
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:30,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, usually I don't run out to go see these movies, but this one's actually one I'm looking forward to.

629
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:33,014
[SPEAKER_02]: The trailer's a little eh.

630
00:41:33,653 --> 00:41:37,036
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, as far as the way they did it, it makes it a little cheesy.

631
00:41:37,356 --> 00:41:38,337
[SPEAKER_02]: But it looks good.

632
00:41:38,457 --> 00:41:44,801
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially if you watch the teaser, you know, the way they did the teaser trailer, it's really, you know... The teaser was awesome.

633
00:41:44,981 --> 00:41:45,762
[SPEAKER_01]: That was awesome.

634
00:41:45,922 --> 00:41:48,044
[SPEAKER_01]: That had, like, the total style of Silent Hill and everything.

635
00:41:48,204 --> 00:41:53,648
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially towards the end of the trailer when they show Pyramid Head again, you know, it's going to be just awesome.

636
00:41:54,888 --> 00:41:59,312
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm scared I'm going to be really let down because my expectations now are so, so, so high for this movie.

637
00:41:59,652 --> 00:42:01,493
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really scared I'm going to get let down by it.

638
00:42:01,994 --> 00:42:02,254
[SPEAKER_02]: I think...

639
00:42:02,974 --> 00:42:06,357
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those films, at some point they're going to have to be good.

640
00:42:06,538 --> 00:42:07,659
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to have to start being good.

641
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:15,886
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think what people need is a movie to set the bar so that people will stop going to see these piece of crap movies that Webull puts out.

642
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:23,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're really bad and they need to have some people out there go, you know what, this is what a video game movie should look like.

643
00:42:23,713 --> 00:42:25,274
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not paying to see this crap.

644
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop putting this crap out.

645
00:42:27,016 --> 00:42:28,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk to these studios.

646
00:42:28,117 --> 00:42:29,138
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they need to be doing.

647
00:42:29,629 --> 00:42:42,895
[SPEAKER_04]: I honestly, I would have to say, because they would have to, to get that degree of accuracy and to keep the story that far in line, they'd have to be working fairly close with the creating team out of Konami.

648
00:42:43,055 --> 00:42:46,756
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know the Konami logo shows up at the end of the trailer, so that was kind of cool.

649
00:42:47,576 --> 00:42:51,278
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I suppose that's a property rights thing anyway, but, you know, still promising.

650
00:42:51,338 --> 00:42:57,260
[SPEAKER_04]: That also offers hope, though, that if Konami is getting in on that and making it so good, you know?

651
00:42:57,361 --> 00:42:58,421
[SPEAKER_01]: That they won't fuck up Metal Gear?

652
00:43:00,715 --> 00:43:02,317
[SPEAKER_04]: I want so bad for a Metal Gear movie.

653
00:43:02,337 --> 00:43:05,480
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that in this case I really pray that his reputation is heated.

654
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:05,700
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

655
00:43:17,134 --> 00:43:18,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, moving on.

656
00:43:18,755 --> 00:43:23,876
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you know, there's lots of things that lazy people do, and one of them is watching a lot of movies.

657
00:43:24,596 --> 00:43:26,437
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them could be playing a lot of games.

658
00:43:26,557 --> 00:43:33,659
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, one of these folks who lost a lot of weight recently has been in the media, says that games made him fat.

659
00:43:33,739 --> 00:43:34,219
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, Loki?

660
00:43:34,659 --> 00:43:35,339
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on with this?

661
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:40,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Jared, he was apparently a big Nintendo fan.

662
00:43:40,781 --> 00:43:42,141
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, Jared, like the Subway guy?

663
00:43:42,421 --> 00:43:42,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

664
00:43:43,001 --> 00:43:43,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay, that guy.

665
00:43:44,502 --> 00:43:45,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he...

666
00:43:45,475 --> 00:43:46,336
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

667
00:44:03,587 --> 00:44:06,850
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think Nintendo is the sole thing to blame here, obviously.

668
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:13,474
[SPEAKER_04]: He needs to be blaming himself for not getting his ass up off the couch and going outside and exercising.

669
00:44:13,815 --> 00:44:15,056
[SPEAKER_04]: He has himself to blame.

670
00:44:15,136 --> 00:44:17,517
[SPEAKER_04]: And trust me, I've lost 80 pounds.

671
00:44:19,179 --> 00:44:24,723
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that what it took for me was getting my ass up off from in front of the TV and going and working out and eating right.

672
00:44:25,043 --> 00:44:27,064
[SPEAKER_04]: He had to have done the same thing, right?

673
00:44:27,785 --> 00:44:29,226
[SPEAKER_02]: He says he had, you know,

674
00:44:30,393 --> 00:44:33,634
[SPEAKER_02]: One hand on the controller, one hand in a bag of chips.

675
00:44:34,435 --> 00:44:35,895
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know who we need to be coming after.

676
00:44:36,295 --> 00:44:36,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Potato chips!

677
00:44:37,096 --> 00:44:38,556
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the root of all evil.

678
00:44:38,716 --> 00:44:43,078
[SPEAKER_04]: He needs to take responsibility for himself and blame it on his own personal weakness.

679
00:44:43,778 --> 00:44:46,999
[SPEAKER_04]: People themselves are responsible for their own health.

680
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,880
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, here, devil's advocate for a minute.

681
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:52,481
[SPEAKER_01]: Is Nintendo an enabler?

682
00:44:52,822 --> 00:44:53,882
[SPEAKER_01]: Or video games in general?

683
00:44:54,342 --> 00:44:55,202
[SPEAKER_04]: It was still his choice.

684
00:44:55,383 --> 00:44:55,963
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just there.

685
00:44:56,543 --> 00:44:59,044
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same thing as sitting and watching pay-per-view all day.

686
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:13,433
[SPEAKER_01]: Video games in that regard are no different from sitting on the couch watching pay-per-view, wrestling, porn, internet, chat rooms.

687
00:45:14,553 --> 00:45:15,374
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all the same.

688
00:45:15,854 --> 00:45:29,223
[SPEAKER_04]: It was his choice to sit and play the game, and it was his choice to eat potato chips, and then, to his credit, he made the decision to do something different.

689
00:45:30,137 --> 00:45:35,319
[SPEAKER_04]: He decided one day to get up and eat something better, even if it was Subway.

690
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,280
[SPEAKER_04]: God, Togo's is so much better.

691
00:45:38,461 --> 00:45:39,602
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a Quiznos fan, but anyway.

692
00:45:39,822 --> 00:45:45,344
[SPEAKER_04]: But he made the decision to put some effort and take responsibility for himself.

693
00:45:45,464 --> 00:45:51,247
[SPEAKER_04]: To him, go back and blame Nintendo for his obesity?

694
00:45:52,127 --> 00:45:52,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Just completely...

695
00:45:54,248 --> 00:45:56,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Cast a big shadow over all of what he's done.

696
00:45:56,290 --> 00:46:01,553
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time though, is the gamer community taking this one little quote and blowing it completely out of context?

697
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:02,234
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it is.

698
00:46:02,254 --> 00:46:03,815
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just a spin on the story.

699
00:46:03,855 --> 00:46:08,018
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it's probably something like, you know, I used to sit around playing my Nintendo.

700
00:46:08,538 --> 00:46:13,262
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he was just probably trying to point out that he was lazy and eating, you know, he wasn't eating right.

701
00:46:13,542 --> 00:46:16,604
[SPEAKER_01]: and someone's like, oh, he said Nintendo, oh, it's all their fault.

702
00:46:16,964 --> 00:46:18,725
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of seeing it a little bit like that, too.

703
00:46:18,765 --> 00:46:29,171
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we can kind of poke fun, but in a realistic way is that, you know what, use Jared as an example that, you know, if you are feeling fat, you should put down the controller and go walk.

704
00:46:29,191 --> 00:46:34,434
[SPEAKER_01]: Because he said, he says that it's not just Subway that made him thinner, it was getting up and walking, going on walks.

705
00:46:34,694 --> 00:46:38,815
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to actually quote Legend of Zaku here because I fully believe this.

706
00:46:39,115 --> 00:46:40,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Big happy quote for me.

707
00:46:41,475 --> 00:46:45,616
[SPEAKER_04]: America, the land that personal responsibility forgot.

708
00:46:47,936 --> 00:46:56,278
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it says though, since he was almost 425 pounds, he would have been about 600 pounds though if he were playing World of Warcraft instead of Nintendo.

709
00:46:56,458 --> 00:46:58,938
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, just think about if they had World of Warcraft back then.

710
00:46:59,038 --> 00:47:02,439
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, moving on.

711
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:03,299
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd be dead.

712
00:47:05,123 --> 00:47:13,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Real quick, how much gaming is too much and how can you prevent yourself from being 400 pounds overweight like Jared?

713
00:47:14,006 --> 00:47:16,988
[SPEAKER_01]: Or whatever he was, I'm sorry, I'm probably grossly over-exaggerating.

714
00:47:17,008 --> 00:47:20,729
[SPEAKER_01]: But how can you prevent yourself from being that overweight?

715
00:47:21,449 --> 00:47:24,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know I was on my way there, unfortunately.

716
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:28,992
[SPEAKER_04]: I moved out here from Alabama and put on something like...

717
00:47:30,632 --> 00:47:38,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually, I'm now under what I weighed when I moved out here, but I did put on something like 70 pounds.

718
00:47:40,038 --> 00:47:41,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Dan and I are both gamers.

719
00:47:41,459 --> 00:47:43,981
[SPEAKER_04]: We sat around playing Street Fighter all day.

720
00:47:44,381 --> 00:47:44,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

721
00:47:44,942 --> 00:47:45,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm not joking.

722
00:47:45,982 --> 00:47:48,024
[SPEAKER_04]: It was that or Castlevania, Symphony of the Night.

723
00:47:48,964 --> 00:47:55,569
[SPEAKER_04]: And I finally hit my saturation point in 2003 and said, you know, I can't go on this way anymore.

724
00:47:55,589 --> 00:47:55,609
[SPEAKER_04]: I...

725
00:47:57,683 --> 00:48:00,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Right then and there, I didn't consider it a diet.

726
00:48:00,524 --> 00:48:01,684
[SPEAKER_04]: I made a lifestyle change.

727
00:48:02,365 --> 00:48:06,726
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to incorporate little changes into your life and make them habit.

728
00:48:07,807 --> 00:48:08,667
[SPEAKER_01]: Go outside the game.

729
00:48:09,167 --> 00:48:09,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

730
00:48:10,027 --> 00:48:12,328
[SPEAKER_04]: What you do... I played DDR for a while.

731
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:13,108
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR was helpful.

732
00:48:13,168 --> 00:48:13,889
[SPEAKER_04]: It was exercise.

733
00:48:13,929 --> 00:48:15,089
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fun and exercise.

734
00:48:15,449 --> 00:48:16,790
[SPEAKER_04]: But I learned to like going to the gym.

735
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:18,370
[SPEAKER_04]: I got involved in classes.

736
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:22,392
[SPEAKER_04]: I worked out with my friends who were also... It's good to have a friend who has the same goals as you.

737
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:23,352
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

738
00:48:23,965 --> 00:48:24,505
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

739
00:48:48,908 --> 00:48:49,909
[SPEAKER_02]: It was quite interesting.

740
00:48:50,229 --> 00:48:56,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Before, I used to play Final Fantasy 3 and stuff, really long RPGs, and I wouldn't really get out and do anything.

741
00:48:57,016 --> 00:49:00,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I went and played actual QZAR, and that was a lot of exercise and stuff.

742
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:05,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I stopped playing QZAR to play Final Fantasy 7 and 10 and stuff, and I got really lazy again.

743
00:49:05,966 --> 00:49:10,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Then DDR came out, and I started playing a lot of DDR, and that got me back to exercising.

744
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:12,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Then Final Fantasy 11 came around, and I stopped.

745
00:49:13,203 --> 00:49:17,624
[SPEAKER_01]: DDR is a great revolution in games, but at the same time it's not the magic weight loss program.

746
00:49:18,304 --> 00:49:19,885
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just play DDR and expect to drop 50 pounds.

747
00:49:34,834 --> 00:49:37,816
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, kind of like Jamie said, it's got to be a bit of a lifestyle change, too.

748
00:49:37,836 --> 00:49:39,656
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just play DDR for 15 minutes a day.

749
00:49:39,937 --> 00:49:48,301
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll help, and you'll get some exercise, but you're not going to really, it's not going to be like this magic, just watch the fat fly, you know, it's different.

750
00:49:48,321 --> 00:49:52,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if you're doing what I was doing and playing DDR for an hour and a half every day...

751
00:49:54,755 --> 00:49:57,096
[SPEAKER_04]: You remember when I got mine on Dreamcast back when?

752
00:49:57,536 --> 00:50:01,537
[SPEAKER_04]: I was playing DDR daily for an hour trying to beat the harder stuff.

753
00:50:02,117 --> 00:50:05,458
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was that challenging myself is what kept me going.

754
00:50:05,718 --> 00:50:08,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Finding personal satisfaction in the competitive side of it.

755
00:50:08,498 --> 00:50:10,959
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me use a real life scenario to kind of illustrate what I'm saying here.

756
00:50:11,499 --> 00:50:14,560
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes me in a group and sometimes you guys would go and what have you.

757
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:14,980
[SPEAKER_01]: It just depends.

758
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,101
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to go out every Wednesday and we'd meet up at the arcade for DDR and whatever else.

759
00:50:19,541 --> 00:50:28,203
[SPEAKER_01]: and then after we were done, we would go to Brookfields and dine on cheese sticks and soda and soup that's really high in fat and stuff.

760
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:35,865
[SPEAKER_01]: See, that's what I'm saying is that there was no change there because you go play DDR and it's like, damn, that game made me hungry.

761
00:50:35,885 --> 00:50:39,026
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to eat a whole basket of cheese sticks by myself.

762
00:50:39,668 --> 00:50:42,149
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually did lose weight when we were doing that regularly.

763
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:42,610
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?

764
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:44,711
[SPEAKER_01]: But you weren't ordering the same stuff, were you?

765
00:50:44,891 --> 00:50:53,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, but then again, that was when I was also doing my I think I'm going to be a vegetarian now shtick, and then I went back to eating meat in 2003.

766
00:50:53,236 --> 00:50:55,297
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I did the vegetarian thing for two weeks, too.

767
00:50:55,517 --> 00:51:00,120
[SPEAKER_04]: And now my body's forcing me into being a vegetarian, but that's just because of my antibiotics.

768
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:02,341
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, new subject, new subject.

769
00:51:02,361 --> 00:51:03,161
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to keep it moving here.

770
00:51:03,181 --> 00:51:04,862
[SPEAKER_01]: We still have a lot we want to cover here before we get a break.

771
00:51:06,103 --> 00:51:07,484
[SPEAKER_01]: Starting with...

772
00:51:08,294 --> 00:51:08,756
[SPEAKER_01]: Kojima.

773
00:51:09,117 --> 00:51:09,659
[SPEAKER_01]: You know Kojima.

774
00:51:09,679 --> 00:51:11,023
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the guy that does Metal Gear.

775
00:51:11,184 --> 00:51:11,986
[SPEAKER_01]: Hide-chan.

776
00:51:12,167 --> 00:51:12,548
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

777
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:13,692
[SPEAKER_01]: He has...

778
00:51:14,443 --> 00:51:15,744
[SPEAKER_01]: This kind of podcast thing going on.

779
00:51:15,784 --> 00:51:27,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Those of you guys that are into the podcasting thing might get a kick out of this, is that there's actually a podcast show that he's doing, and he even incorporates Solid Snake into it, which is kind of silly, but whatever.

780
00:51:27,829 --> 00:51:34,172
[SPEAKER_01]: It's over on Hideo Kojima's blog, which is www.blog.konami.jp.

781
00:51:35,433 --> 00:51:37,814
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, slash GS slash Hideo blog.

782
00:51:37,834 --> 00:51:38,134
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

783
00:51:38,174 --> 00:51:39,815
[SPEAKER_01]: Just go to blog.konami.jp.

784
00:51:39,835 --> 00:51:40,295
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find it.

785
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:42,117
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's also now in English as well.

786
00:51:42,477 --> 00:51:47,662
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find his own podcast show and it's called Hidechan Radio.

787
00:51:48,503 --> 00:51:49,464
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not in English.

788
00:51:50,545 --> 00:51:55,350
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to kind of understand at least a little bit of Japanese unless you just want to listen to Japanese talk.

789
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:59,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're into anime and you're just listening to sexy Japanese talking or whatever, you might get a kick out of this.

790
00:51:59,774 --> 00:52:00,975
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good educational tool.

791
00:52:01,075 --> 00:52:01,496
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.

792
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:04,061
[SPEAKER_01]: Lucha Libre, Telemundo

793
00:52:34,081 --> 00:52:39,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Video Games Live, concert featuring performances of music from various classic game titles.

794
00:52:39,583 --> 00:52:46,626
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be on Friday, March 24th and performed by the Symphony Silicon Valley Orchestra and its full chorus.

795
00:52:47,967 --> 00:52:49,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we going to have the Pong music again?

796
00:52:51,040 --> 00:53:05,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Among the games to be highlighted, we have Mario, Zelda, Halo, Metal Gear Solid, Warcraft, Myst, Castlevania, Medal of Honor, Sonic, Kingdom Hearts, and Final Fantasy, along with a retro classic arcade medley featuring over 20 games.

797
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:08,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, sounds good.

798
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:09,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Get your tickets soon.

799
00:53:09,131 --> 00:53:10,071
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to sell out.

800
00:53:11,332 --> 00:53:12,713
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, now we're going to move on to another topic.

801
00:53:12,733 --> 00:53:14,074
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's kind of a long topic.

802
00:53:14,434 --> 00:53:19,817
[SPEAKER_01]: And the chat room's actually been asking about this all night long when we're going to get to this, so here we go.

803
00:53:21,505 --> 00:53:30,329
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys probably heard earlier this week there was a gamer out there who took his own life and he was a member of this forum.

804
00:53:30,369 --> 00:53:32,010
[SPEAKER_01]: Which was what?

805
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:33,651
[SPEAKER_01]: A Metal Gear Solid forum, if I remember right.

806
00:53:33,691 --> 00:53:34,611
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, here's the thing.

807
00:53:34,972 --> 00:53:46,297
[SPEAKER_01]: The media kind of tied a knot of this story and I'm even looking at this article that Kotaku ran on it that really was trying to sort things out about what the media misreported.

808
00:53:46,317 --> 00:53:49,439
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the media said it was a Bulgarian website at some point or something.

809
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:49,799
[SPEAKER_01]: It was crazy.

810
00:53:49,819 --> 00:53:49,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

811
00:53:50,669 --> 00:53:52,030
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

812
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:13,202
[SPEAKER_01]: Tim Rogers misrepresentation of the AFP story

813
00:54:30,379 --> 00:54:31,660
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to read little blips of this here.

814
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,522
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get political with you for a moment.

815
00:54:33,542 --> 00:54:35,343
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently it was big news for a few moments over in America.

816
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:55,418
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the worst thing is it's not true.

817
00:54:55,798 --> 00:55:00,680
[SPEAKER_01]: For one thing, the forum member who did in fact commit suicide did not broadcast his death.

818
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:04,161
[SPEAKER_01]: Moreover, the forum members tried with all their might to take him down.

819
00:55:05,421 --> 00:55:15,825
[SPEAKER_01]: What can you do is contact the AFPY organization, tell them that you think this is horrible, that they should fire the reporter responsible for these bizarrely malicious lies, and then apologize as widely as possible.

820
00:55:15,845 --> 00:55:20,927
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to read the whole thing, that was originally published over an insert credit, but it also ran on Kotaku, which is where I first saw it.

821
00:55:22,635 --> 00:55:24,836
[SPEAKER_01]: Good Activism and Bad Activism

822
00:55:38,701 --> 00:55:41,423
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to mince my words on this.

823
00:55:41,503 --> 00:55:43,664
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to say exactly how I feel.

824
00:55:44,084 --> 00:55:52,170
[SPEAKER_04]: And before he decides to come after us and say... These are my opinions of you.

825
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:57,333
[SPEAKER_04]: I am exercising my First Amendment right, you asshole!

826
00:55:58,675 --> 00:55:59,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Jack Thompson is a leech.

827
00:56:00,516 --> 00:56:02,457
[SPEAKER_04]: He is nothing but a parasite.

828
00:56:02,918 --> 00:56:05,539
[SPEAKER_04]: He cares nothing about the person that committed suicide.

829
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:07,100
[SPEAKER_04]: He cares nothing about the family.

830
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:10,102
[SPEAKER_04]: He cares nothing about the families of the people involved in those cases he's working on.

831
00:56:10,522 --> 00:56:19,147
[SPEAKER_04]: He is using their pain and suffering to be a leech and use it to further his goal of notoriety and to fill his pocketbook.

832
00:56:19,187 --> 00:56:20,248
[SPEAKER_04]: That is all he is after.

833
00:56:20,308 --> 00:56:21,969
[SPEAKER_04]: He cares nothing about those families.

834
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:28,252
[SPEAKER_04]: and, of course, is using the gaming community by basically publicly defaming the entire community.

835
00:56:28,452 --> 00:56:30,994
[SPEAKER_01]: And what did he do to demonstrate this to you this week?

836
00:56:31,494 --> 00:56:39,158
[SPEAKER_04]: It had to do with basically the letters and posts he was doing regarding the suicide that went on.

837
00:56:40,659 --> 00:56:49,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, and on top of that, I find this exactly hilarious, he was trying to use the Bible to support, and he's a lawyer?

838
00:56:49,644 --> 00:56:49,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

839
00:56:50,242 --> 00:56:52,143
[SPEAKER_04]: He should know something like that would not hold up in court.

840
00:56:52,323 --> 00:56:52,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me?

841
00:56:53,103 --> 00:56:53,343
[SPEAKER_01]: No, wait.

842
00:56:53,363 --> 00:56:55,164
[SPEAKER_01]: Devil's Advocate for just a minute because I'm curious here.

843
00:56:55,224 --> 00:56:56,285
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we know it's really him?

844
00:56:56,345 --> 00:56:59,906
[SPEAKER_01]: Because these are being done through anonymous posts on the game's politics website.

845
00:57:00,266 --> 00:57:01,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, game politics website, right?

846
00:57:02,047 --> 00:57:03,448
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we know it's really him?

847
00:57:04,068 --> 00:57:06,129
[SPEAKER_01]: Could it just be somebody trying to... Trace of IP?

848
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:13,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, every other thing that I've ever read by him, it very much fits how he writes.

849
00:57:14,642 --> 00:57:18,745
[SPEAKER_04]: and I've gotten good at that because I've had to hunt down impersonators and things before.

850
00:57:29,873 --> 00:57:38,041
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they actually posted in there some type of letter that Jack Thompson had tried to send to the folks in Pennsylvania against GamePolitics.com.

851
00:57:54,259 --> 00:57:58,800
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's definitive of how gamers can be very intelligent people.

852
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:00,561
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this website stands up for that.

853
00:58:00,881 --> 00:58:04,162
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I see Jack Thompson attacking that, it makes me go, he's threatened by that.

854
00:58:04,362 --> 00:58:11,304
[SPEAKER_01]: He's threatened by that good, upstanding gamers doing smart, intelligent things.

855
00:58:12,145 --> 00:58:18,146
[SPEAKER_04]: He called playing video games a masturbatory activity, as in senseless self-stimulation.

856
00:58:18,447 --> 00:58:23,088
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, maybe if he had some stimulation, he wouldn't be so anal retentive that he spews shit every time he opens his mouth.

857
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:25,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

858
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:27,011
[SPEAKER_04]: I said I wasn't going to mince my words.

859
00:58:27,031 --> 00:58:28,292
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly how I feel.

860
00:58:28,752 --> 00:58:29,092
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

861
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:29,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

862
00:58:29,832 --> 00:58:30,893
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be a good girl now.

863
00:58:31,053 --> 00:58:32,914
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have to explicit tag this show.

864
00:58:32,934 --> 00:58:33,374
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all right.

865
00:58:34,834 --> 00:58:35,795
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually that gets more listeners.

866
00:58:35,855 --> 00:58:36,075
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

867
00:58:36,855 --> 00:58:37,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay, press.

868
00:58:37,455 --> 00:58:37,575
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

869
00:58:37,976 --> 00:58:41,377
[SPEAKER_04]: But seriously, I apologize for my... That was very Jack Thompson of you.

870
00:58:42,578 --> 00:58:42,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Just teasing.

871
00:58:43,758 --> 00:58:48,120
[SPEAKER_04]: But seriously, though, and this... I get the emails on it.

872
00:58:49,011 --> 00:58:53,353
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear about it and it's just, I hit my saturation point.

873
00:58:53,593 --> 00:58:57,915
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, okay, someone, he needs to just go away.

874
00:58:58,816 --> 00:59:04,839
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I'm always one that believes if you ignore the problem, you know, it doesn't necessarily go away.

875
00:59:04,939 --> 00:59:05,619
[SPEAKER_04]: It might get worse.

876
00:59:06,299 --> 00:59:09,101
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, things don't change until you make them change, right?

877
00:59:09,721 --> 00:59:15,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone seriously, you know, if he's going to be all up in arms defaming the community, I think the community needs to take some steps to defend itself.

878
00:59:17,346 --> 00:59:17,787
[SPEAKER_01]: FlowersForJack.com

879
00:59:32,746 --> 00:59:36,007
[SPEAKER_01]: LiveJournal.com LiveJournal.com LiveJournal.com LiveJournal.com

880
01:00:02,208 --> 01:00:04,370
[SPEAKER_01]: This only makes us into what he says we are.

881
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:10,355
[SPEAKER_01]: We are to the point that he will disregard any correspondence at the very least, threaten it legally at the most.

882
01:00:10,776 --> 01:00:12,337
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to get his attention for real.

883
01:00:12,697 --> 01:00:20,344
[SPEAKER_01]: I propose we write him a stern, dignified letter free of insults, exaggerations or unfounded complaints and state the most honest and reasonable case we can.

884
01:00:20,704 --> 01:00:25,909
[SPEAKER_01]: Most importantly, it will be sent with as many bouquets of beautiful pink roses as I can possibly send to his office.

885
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:27,050
[SPEAKER_01]: Love it.

886
01:00:27,603 --> 01:00:27,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Love it.

887
01:00:28,404 --> 01:00:29,284
[SPEAKER_03]: You should totally do that.

888
01:00:29,965 --> 01:00:32,767
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to send $20 on behalf of Orange Lounge Radio.

889
01:00:32,787 --> 01:00:33,808
[SPEAKER_01]: We are contributing to this.

890
01:00:33,828 --> 01:00:35,769
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to call an act of terrorism.

891
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:38,711
[SPEAKER_01]: Flowers, an act of terrorism, come on.

892
01:00:39,212 --> 01:00:39,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on.

893
01:00:40,613 --> 01:00:46,978
[SPEAKER_04]: And for all those people that I'm reading that say, you know, kill him, do that, no.

894
01:00:46,998 --> 01:00:49,159
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly what these guys are saying you should not do.

895
01:00:49,339 --> 01:00:54,263
[SPEAKER_04]: But my other point to that, to maybe convince people that that's not the best course of action?

896
01:00:54,824 --> 01:00:55,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Martyr.

897
01:00:56,150 --> 01:00:58,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember what happened to our last major martyr, right?

898
01:00:58,492 --> 01:01:00,834
[SPEAKER_04]: We now have rampant Christianity everywhere.

899
01:01:01,474 --> 01:01:12,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Now listen, this is the same guy who considered a donation in his name of $10,000 as a defamation of character.

900
01:01:12,423 --> 01:01:14,425
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's pretty retarded.

901
01:01:16,026 --> 01:01:23,572
[SPEAKER_04]: I did also find it funny that one of the things I read, how he's bringing out that had this person known the love of Jesus Christ, they wouldn't have done that.

902
01:01:24,033 --> 01:01:25,694
[SPEAKER_04]: He was basically shot down by a minister.

903
01:01:26,844 --> 01:01:29,707
[SPEAKER_04]: by a Protestant pastor.

904
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:33,029
[SPEAKER_01]: This kind of brings me to another point.

905
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:46,200
[SPEAKER_01]: I get really nervous when we get into the religious talk on this show, and I'm not a very religious person myself, and there are certain types of religious people I have a lot of respect for.

906
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:54,407
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a really, really good friend of mine at work who's a deeply religious person, but I value him totally as a friend, and I really respect him and his beliefs and stuff because

907
01:01:54,707 --> 01:01:55,408
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

908
01:02:13,173 --> 01:02:14,474
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how much of this I really want to read.

909
01:02:14,494 --> 01:02:17,055
[SPEAKER_01]: You should just go read it for yourself over on GamePolitics.com.

910
01:02:17,815 --> 01:02:25,359
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a Christian, non-denominational, yet I am also the first person to admit that enforcing religious opinion as a way of censorship in video games is asinine.

911
01:02:25,679 --> 01:02:26,480
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's face facts.

912
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:28,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Video games are fiction, just like books, movies, and television.

913
01:02:29,241 --> 01:02:35,984
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it seems as if pundits, lawyers, and media mongers have been using my religion as a meat shield for their ignorant attacks on video games.

914
01:02:36,804 --> 01:02:39,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting, and it kind of goes on to these...

915
01:02:40,475 --> 01:02:40,975
[SPEAKER_01]: GamePolitics.com

916
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:11,247
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a good point.

917
01:03:11,668 --> 01:03:12,668
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a very good point.

918
01:03:13,128 --> 01:03:15,809
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we do also donate to charity once in a while, too.

919
01:03:15,869 --> 01:03:22,051
[SPEAKER_01]: We did the big audio Sacramento Independent Audio for Katrina Relief thing a while ago, which was a good success.

920
01:03:22,512 --> 01:03:23,832
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so we do that stuff, too.

921
01:03:23,892 --> 01:03:27,273
[SPEAKER_01]: But we, you know, we support causes that we want to back.

922
01:03:27,393 --> 01:03:33,856
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is definitely one of those causes that we think ought to deserve a little support and a little air time and a little money.

923
01:03:34,096 --> 01:03:34,636
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a little money.

924
01:03:34,656 --> 01:03:35,336
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not sending them a lot.

925
01:03:35,396 --> 01:03:36,177
[SPEAKER_01]: Twenty bucks isn't a lot.

926
01:03:36,757 --> 01:03:37,317
[SPEAKER_01]: So, anyway.

927
01:03:38,998 --> 01:03:39,318
[SPEAKER_01]: Whew.

928
01:03:40,874 --> 01:03:41,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else you want to say on that?

929
01:03:42,695 --> 01:03:43,055
[SPEAKER_01]: We good?

930
01:03:43,575 --> 01:03:44,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, you're awfully quiet.

931
01:03:45,916 --> 01:03:56,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack, he had that thing that came out last week about wanting to recall all these games that are coming out in 25 to Life and all these violent murder simulators, as he said.

932
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:58,920
[SPEAKER_02]: He's right.

933
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,181
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have too many murder simulators out there.

934
01:04:01,201 --> 01:04:03,002
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we need more sex simulators.

935
01:04:03,162 --> 01:04:04,282
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm hoping for.

936
01:04:05,503 --> 01:04:08,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Rockstar, if you're listening, get on it.

937
01:04:08,724 --> 01:04:09,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot coffee the game.

938
01:04:10,442 --> 01:04:10,783
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

939
01:04:11,123 --> 01:04:13,446
[SPEAKER_01]: We got one more segment to do before we go to break here.

940
01:04:13,646 --> 01:04:18,272
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just seemed like, I don't know why, but it seemed like an inappropriate time to get into this segment.

941
01:04:18,593 --> 01:04:19,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's just me.

942
01:04:19,954 --> 01:04:24,000
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's time to bring on the anger in the FUs of the week.

943
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:35,881
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, what's ticking you off this week?

944
01:04:36,681 --> 01:04:41,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think I actually just ranted myself out on the biggest thing that was pissing me off this week.

945
01:04:43,424 --> 01:04:56,590
[SPEAKER_04]: So, instead of going off on ye olde butthead again, I'm going to have to say that my biggest FU of the week goes toward waiting to the last minute to get things done.

946
01:04:57,410 --> 01:05:02,152
[SPEAKER_04]: In this case, I blame myself because I waited to the last minute to check my tires, so now I have a flat.

947
01:05:02,973 --> 01:05:03,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops!

948
01:05:04,668 --> 01:05:32,354
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's I see so many I have to deal with this so often in my daily work people going oh I didn't do it or oh I forgot or oh this it goes back to this thing called personal responsibility right it's personal responsibility I think people not accounting for it not having it is what is contributing to the downfall of this country you see it in little things every day you see it on a wide scale like with our

949
01:05:33,613 --> 01:05:39,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Not-so-good-friend Mr. Thompson, who is blaming games instead of individual people for their own actions, right?

950
01:05:40,617 --> 01:05:43,539
[SPEAKER_04]: We see it ourselves with, oh, well, I can just do this later.

951
01:05:44,199 --> 01:05:46,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Or with, oh, but I was busy doing this.

952
01:05:47,381 --> 01:05:49,843
[SPEAKER_04]: If people said, you know, I admit I was wrong.

953
01:05:50,243 --> 01:05:51,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me make amends.

954
01:05:51,824 --> 01:05:52,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me do this.

955
01:05:53,005 --> 01:05:56,186
[SPEAKER_04]: If people would just stop and admit, hey, you know, you need to do this.

956
01:05:57,007 --> 01:05:58,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, I didn't do it.

957
01:05:58,808 --> 01:05:59,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, here, it's done.

958
01:06:00,129 --> 01:06:00,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on time.

959
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:02,090
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that

960
01:06:02,927 --> 01:06:03,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Would I be better off?

961
01:06:05,088 --> 01:06:06,528
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a sign of responsibility.

962
01:06:07,648 --> 01:06:11,649
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the moment you admit that you broke the glass is the day you're supposed to be an adult, right?

963
01:06:12,429 --> 01:06:13,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of blaming the dog.

964
01:06:14,650 --> 01:06:14,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.

965
01:06:16,010 --> 01:06:16,350
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

966
01:06:16,811 --> 01:06:17,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki?

967
01:06:18,491 --> 01:06:18,951
[SPEAKER_02]: My F.U.

968
01:06:18,971 --> 01:06:21,032
[SPEAKER_02]: of the week is going to McDonald's.

969
01:06:21,412 --> 01:06:23,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Mainly, though, it's not McDonald's fault.

970
01:06:23,932 --> 01:06:28,614
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm blaming vegetarians and fat people for making McDonald's food taste like crap.

971
01:06:28,994 --> 01:06:29,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the reason why.

972
01:06:30,356 --> 01:06:36,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Before the vegetarians attacked McDonald's for adding their meat flavoring to their fries, their fries kicked ass.

973
01:06:36,503 --> 01:06:41,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they came in, fries taste like crap now, and they can't freaking cook them, poor damn.

974
01:06:42,222 --> 01:06:46,103
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing is, also, they've tried to make these more healthy choices on their menus.

975
01:06:46,583 --> 01:06:46,863
[SPEAKER_02]: No!

976
01:06:47,403 --> 01:06:47,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Need?

977
01:06:47,924 --> 01:06:50,944
[SPEAKER_02]: The food was good before you had to go and fuck with it.

978
01:06:51,004 --> 01:06:53,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, if you don't want to eat that crap, don't attack my food.

979
01:06:54,065 --> 01:06:55,806
[SPEAKER_02]: God damn it, I love super size.

980
01:06:56,146 --> 01:06:58,847
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the amount of soda that I got there and the amount of fries.

981
01:06:59,087 --> 01:07:00,027
[SPEAKER_02]: I was happy with that.

982
01:07:00,067 --> 01:07:03,048
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, you had to come in and put large size on there instead.

983
01:07:03,788 --> 01:07:04,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you!

984
01:07:04,948 --> 01:07:05,928
[SPEAKER_02]: I want my food!

985
01:07:08,129 --> 01:07:08,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

986
01:07:09,069 --> 01:07:11,550
[SPEAKER_01]: My FU of the week goes to Ticket

987
01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:40,909
[SPEAKER_01]: and things like Ticketmaster and Tickets.com because I still haven't gotten my tickets for a concert that's coming up next week and I hate these exorbitant charges just for printing a freaking ticket it's so crazy I don't like the way tickets are done I never get good seats why is it that I can log on there at like 10.01 and all the good seats are gone oh because all the good seats go to contest winners and industry people and people that don't deserve to be in the front row I deserve to be in the front row

988
01:07:42,144 --> 01:07:44,746
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like the way ticketing is done, so F you to that

989
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,801
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

990
01:08:41,241 --> 01:08:41,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Adorable.

991
01:08:42,122 --> 01:08:46,525
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically the whole premise of this site is people actually just putting things on the cat.

992
01:08:47,166 --> 01:08:47,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Sending a picture.

993
01:08:48,227 --> 01:08:52,330
[SPEAKER_01]: Now please don't hurt your cat if you're going to do this, because that's animal cruelty and that's not cool.

994
01:08:52,550 --> 01:08:56,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of these cats just look anywhere from amused to vaguely annoyed.

995
01:08:56,433 --> 01:08:57,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are game related though, right?

996
01:08:57,795 --> 01:09:00,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, well this one has wrestling figures sitting on the cat.

997
01:09:01,718 --> 01:09:05,080
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was another one, this one has an Xbox 360 laying on a cat.

998
01:09:05,661 --> 01:09:06,822
[SPEAKER_04]: The cat just looks irritated.

999
01:09:07,574 --> 01:09:08,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1000
01:09:37,512 --> 01:09:41,294
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my co-workers and Jamie both pointed this site out to me on the same day.

1001
01:09:41,334 --> 01:09:43,976
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was really weird, like how word travels like that.

1002
01:09:44,636 --> 01:09:45,297
[SPEAKER_01]: It was new to me.

1003
01:09:45,557 --> 01:09:48,258
[SPEAKER_04]: I randomly check stuffonmycat.com quite often.

1004
01:09:48,298 --> 01:09:49,019
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cute!

1005
01:09:49,599 --> 01:09:51,760
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's one with naked Barbies on it.

1006
01:09:52,181 --> 01:09:54,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Another one just with a giant bag on it.

1007
01:09:55,522 --> 01:09:56,423
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's adorable.

1008
01:09:56,483 --> 01:09:57,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I love stuffonmycat.com.

1009
01:10:00,165 --> 01:10:00,846
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's wrong.

1010
01:10:00,866 --> 01:10:03,287
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say my favorite is the one where I saw, you know,

1011
01:10:04,884 --> 01:10:08,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone's SUV's rear tire on top of a cat, but you know.

1012
01:10:08,406 --> 01:10:09,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey!

1013
01:10:10,106 --> 01:10:10,426
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

1014
01:10:10,747 --> 01:10:14,008
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, though, that there should be mycatonstuff.com.

1015
01:10:15,609 --> 01:10:16,869
[SPEAKER_04]: I looked for it, but no one did it yet.

1016
01:10:17,810 --> 01:10:23,712
[SPEAKER_04]: I found the picture with the cat covered in Game Boys, so I'm moving that to the chat room.

1017
01:10:23,732 --> 01:10:24,773
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one my co-workers showed me.

1018
01:10:24,793 --> 01:10:25,853
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what this all is?

1019
01:10:25,933 --> 01:10:27,954
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just the US version of Oolong.

1020
01:10:28,897 --> 01:10:29,617
[SPEAKER_01]: in a way.

1021
01:10:29,637 --> 01:10:31,118
[SPEAKER_01]: You know Oolong's on Wikipedia now.

1022
01:10:31,498 --> 01:10:32,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I link that to you too.

1023
01:10:33,158 --> 01:10:35,439
[SPEAKER_04]: And so is you being, but Oolong's dead.

1024
01:10:35,599 --> 01:10:37,240
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're on Wikipedia, Orange Lounge Radio.

1025
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:41,981
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like, that's when some of my friends told me, dude, Rob, you guys really are famous.

1026
01:10:42,021 --> 01:10:42,901
[SPEAKER_01]: You're on Wikipedia.

1027
01:10:42,921 --> 01:10:43,542
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, come on.

1028
01:10:43,882 --> 01:10:46,042
[SPEAKER_01]: We do this show out of the spare bedroom in my apartment.

1029
01:10:46,302 --> 01:10:49,063
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not famous yet, but we are on Wikipedia, which is all kinds of cool.

1030
01:10:50,003 --> 01:10:51,864
[SPEAKER_04]: We're internet celebrities, yo.

1031
01:10:53,004 --> 01:10:54,125
[SPEAKER_01]: Take that however you want.

1032
01:10:54,625 --> 01:10:55,585
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we're going to go to a break.

1033
01:10:55,605 --> 01:10:58,066
[SPEAKER_01]: When we come back from the break, Loki's going to bring us a whole
