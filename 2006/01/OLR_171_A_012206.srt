00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,080
Tonight, January 22nd, 2006, is because Mondo and Mondo Trouble, a new Silent Hill trailer

2
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,160
hits the net and has everyone buzzing, and we talk about the worst reviewed video games

3
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:31,160
of all time.

4
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:38,360
Welcome everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. This is episode number 171. For this,

5
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,840
January the 22nd, 2006, we're here to talk about video games and what gamers really

6
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,440
want to know about, and of course,

7
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,480
you know, our old catchphrase, the video games

8
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,800
that don't suck, but sometimes we have to tell you about the ones that do suck,

9
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,440
just to tell you to stay away from them.

10
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:01,060
My name is Rob Roberts you might know me as sky joining me as always are my lovely co-hosts. Say hello to dark Sakura Jamie Summers. Oh

11
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:07,600
Your mics your mics off dear. No, it isn't. There we go. I can't find the ferret. Oh, there he is

12
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,820
I've decided the name of the ferret our our mascot ferret which we've had for the past

13
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:18,440
What three and a half years now that we've had a live show. What are we calling the ferret Senor Brito? Why Senor burrito?

14
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,440
Because? Is that a chatroom influence thing?

15
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,440
No, his name is Señor Burrito. Sounds like it. Okay.

16
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,440
Hey, don't mean to step on Señor Burrito over there.

17
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,440
Say hello to Señor Taco over there in the corner. Loki!

18
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,440
I'm not Señor Taco. I do not like tacos.

19
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,440
How are you? Sorry, Señor McDonald's.

20
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,440
I don't know what this is. It's not food, that's for sure.

21
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,200
That's why I don't feel bad eating it see I I can't get fat off of it because it's not actually food

22
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,480
It's like toxic waste in buns. Oh, yeah, and that won't make your ass big. That's that's for sure

23
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,920
All right. Well, we're here to have a wedding to prepare for I am

24
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,480
game over

25
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,840
We're here taping live on this Sunday evening, of course

33
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,240
Because that's how we start things off here. Dark Sakura

34
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,240
Dark Sakura.

35
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,960
Mine was special, as in not very.

36
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:53,740
I actually went, made it to school this week, because I actually sort of started school,

37
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:58,320
and someone was in there playing puppies.

38
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,160
Playing that puppy game, Nintendogs.

39
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,000
Oh, people are still playing Nintendogs?

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,680
Yeah, and I was like, I quit playing that game, because I got kind of bored, and she's

41
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,160
like, BLASPHEMY!

42
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,480
this the one friend of yours that was at your bachelorette party that I just met

43
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,640
her okay nevermind apparently though she's someone who knows um rice princess

44
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:24,220
okay and small has been through the show Oh apparently knows of the show small

45
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:28,600
world so yeah what whatever happened to your friend that was like hardcore and

46
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,960
intend dogs that I I met at your bachelorette party and she had like the

47
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,920
Dalmatian and everything Oh Melchon yes um she's I think she's still playing

48
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,420
with her puppies but she's she's a Dan's assistant manager. That game just got old

49
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:46,460
I'm sorry to say. She's playing with the villages too with her village people. Are

50
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:50,300
they all doing the YMCA? No mine are doing the migrate out of Dark Sakura's

51
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,620
town right now. Mine are doing the let's go pick weeds. I'm actually I'm actually

52
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,880
harassing Lindbergh right now for all of his Japanese stuff in his house because

53
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,900
I'm remaking the shrine to fire. You know the best way to get people to move out

54
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,820
your town on Animal Crossing leave a lot don't talk to them ever and then they

55
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:12,820
leave because they feel ignored good is it is this sad that that we're talking

56
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:19,700
about a fake town on a fake video game no and yet the people like have these

57
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:27,260
real social interactions okay forget it anything else to share um no Loki yes

58
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:32,780
your gaming week you played anything yes um I did play um I actually got to play

59
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:39,020
a little bit more of my 360. I was playing Ridge Racer this morning and I love that game.

60
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,780
It plays exactly like every other Ridge Racer game. Probably because they haven't really

61
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,900
changed much in it. But it looks good and I got through quite a bit. Had to find the

62
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,640
right car, you know, because each car kind of handles a little bit differently. Then

63
00:04:51,640 --> 00:05:00,500
I finally found my right car for it and now I'm kicking ass. And I do like the fact they've

64
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,460
had actually more downloads for it now, so there's more cars, and I purchased some of

65
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,380
the music that I liked from the other games, because you can download that as well, because

66
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:14,580
it costs money, boo, but I did that anyways, and I also played a little bit of Final Fantasy

67
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,340
11 for the 360 because they have the beta now that you can get with the official Xbox

68
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,340
magazine.

69
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:25,180
I was listening to other podcasts where folks were getting the Final Fantasy 11, it was

70
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,220
taking them like three hours to install it.

71
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,220
Oh yeah, yeah.

72
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,020
memories of the PC version hey guess guess what guys here's something you may

73
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,500
not know for those of you that are getting on the 360 for the first time

74
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,700
that weren't doing the PC expect those three hour patches like once every two

75
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,220
months because they'll change something big in the game and then everybody tries

76
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:46,500
to patch at the same time I have to say you know I don't want to start a whole

77
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,540
like MMO debate but World of Warcraft has their patching down like the way

78
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,380
they do it because they use peer-to-peer to do it it's it's smooth I've never had

79
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:59,220
a patching problem on World of Warcraft, but Final Fantasy XI? Ugh. Nightmares. Nightmares.

80
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,940
Well, okay, well playing, the only thing that I would say that's pretty good about this

81
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:09,020
is that the actual, like, screens and the play online stuff's really quick. That's really

82
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:14,940
quick. But that's about it. And then the rest of the game is exactly the same. In fact,

83
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:20,440
I play my 360 on a PC. So I was like, okay PC monitor, this should be a pretty good representation

84
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,700
of the difference between my PC version and this version. There is no difference other

85
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:31,440
than the fact that this one's in letterbox on my PC screen and the other one is not.

86
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,560
Also, by the way, if you don't happen to have a letterbox TV or you're playing on a monitor,

87
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,000
everything is going to be stretched.

88
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,240
Oh my gosh, they're going to letterbox it for regular TVs?

89
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,760
Yes, it's going to be letterboxed.

90
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,480
That chat dialogue is going to be horrible trying to read that stuff on a regular TV.

91
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,120
and you have to have to buy a USB keyboard in order to play this thing

92
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,080
it's impossible near or near possible play without it I mean but that's the

93
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,540
same

94
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,920
story with the PlayStation 2. Does any old USB keyboard work?

95
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,440
Yeah, pretty much. That's not gonna be a problem for most people. That's not a big problem but

96
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,080
the only thing I tried playing a little bit this morning

97
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,720
I can't really level up at all because there's a ton of new people starting

98
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,080
remember this is like a totally

99
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,960
brand new server that they're testing it on right now so everybody's like level one

100
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,760
it's like imagine all the rabbits in the very beginning the game

101
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,280
camp the hell I mean there's like no way to get

102
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,700
anything it kinda sucks and that

103
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:33,040
thats so it's a brand new game for every region right because

104
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,200
when when Final Fantasy 11 launched in the US we were hooked up

105
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,640
automatically with the Japanese servers well so this is just a beta test server

106
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,200
right now

107
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:46,560
so you know and I when I first played Final Fantasy 11 I bought Final Fantasy 11 on launch day

108
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,000
for the PC when it first came out like years ago and I don't remember that

109
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,560
being a problem of course at the same time I didn't know what the hell I was

110
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,120
doing in that game because that game just kind of throws you into it it

111
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,000
doesn't have a very excellent tutorial with it so you just kind of have to jump

112
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,800
in and get going and so I didn't even know to kill rabbits for like a couple

113
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,640
days you remember how long I was going through WTF mode in that game oh yeah I

114
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:14,080
was like I miss I miss I miss Ragnarok already yeah so it doesn't really

115
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,560
improve on anything, and I thought that at least you would have something improve like

116
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:24,280
the textures or something. It doesn't look any better than my PC version. It's like,

117
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:31,120
why the fuck would I go out there and pay $60 for this game? For a 360? There's no point,

118
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,600
really. If you have it for your PC, don't spend the extra money. Oh, Big Whoopie, it

119
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:42,040
has the expansion on there and you get some achievements unlocked. Who cares? It's $60.

120
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:46,520
it's not worth your money.

121
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:51,120
I think for the most part, people that own these next-gen systems probably have a PC

122
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,120
at home.

123
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,880
That's a pretty fair assumption.

124
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,080
If you're interested in an MMO like this, I'm sure that you've probably tried it out.

125
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,680
The other thing that also kind of sucks is that it's not really tied in with Xbox Live

126
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,680
too well.

127
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,660
You have to actually launch the Play Online viewer and all that stuff, and that's lame.

128
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,480
You're going to have to have Xbox Live and Play Online to play it, so you're going to

129
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:17,600
be paying two fees. Not necessarily. You only need silver to play this. So you only have

130
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,320
to really pay one fee. But I'm already paying for Xbox Live gold. What the hell do I need

131
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:28,880
to be paying another fee for? So I'm honestly, I'm not picking this up when this comes out.

132
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,880
I really don't care. In the expansion it's not going to be a big deal. And what they've

133
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:39,140
done with it so far, no I thought this was supposed to be the big huge thing. Ooh look

134
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,740
it's an mmo coming to the xbox who it's going to be amazing

135
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,620
i'm not amazed at all i'm not even impressed

136
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,760
a little bit

137
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,660
it looks just like a pc game i mean the pc version and has not proved in any way

138
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,700
whatsoever

139
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,780
now do you think someone like me or someone like jamie who has a wide screen

140
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:00,600
hd tv of a larger size than any computer monitor

141
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,140
sitting in their living room do you think we might benefit from it a little

142
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,420
more because will have a better

143
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,580
better visual

144
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,540
to handle it

145
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,580
I don't think so. The textures, like I said, aren't improved.

146
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,420
If anything, it's going to be a little bit blurrier for you guys, but that's about it.

147
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:19,500
You remember what I say, though. What's that? It's all about the gameplay.

148
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,860
And it's still Final Fantasy 11! And it still has crap for gameplay!

149
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:27,980
I don't want to sit here and bash 11 totally, unlike Jamie, because

150
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,420
it was a lot. I played Final Fantasy 11 for like two years, okay? There's a lot to

151
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,740
really like about the game,

152
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:38,300
and I suppose that I can at least applaud this coming out on the Xbox 360

153
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,560
because it's kind of making it more accessible to people who are turned off for whatever

154
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,680
reason by PC gaming, but honestly, there's always these debates like console gamer, PC

155
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,040
gamer, console gamer, PC gamer, you gotta, there's really good games on both.

156
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,200
You know, I'd rather see, as much as I really hate Phantasy Star online, I'd rather see

157
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,720
that on this, because at least that's a game I think that they would be able to benefit

158
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,960
and they'd have a new graphics engine and stuff. This is just a straight port and they

159
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:12,720
did nothing to it. They did not enhance anything on it. Now, I didn't see any lag. That may

160
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,960
be the only thing, but other than that, I mean, I haven't even gotten far enough yet

161
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,680
to see if there's any lag anywhere, but I'm not impressed, and I'm not going to be picking

162
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,880
it up when it comes out. Interesting. Unless they give it to me for free. But no, actually

163
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,800
no, I still won't pick it up because then I... Well, I am still paying for it right

164
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,880
now and I'm not playing it. Exactly, exactly. Yeah, what the hell, okay, well if they give

165
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,040
it to me for free, I'll play it, but that's about it. I don't think Square will be sending

166
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,580
you one for free after hearing that little assessment of the beta, so we'll see. Put

167
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:51,580
Kingdom Hearts on, like, freaking Xbox 360. That'd be cool. You can dream. By the way,

168
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,680
assuming all goes well, I should actually have my Kingdom Hearts very, very soon. Oh,

169
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:04,200
are you importing the one from Japan? Yes. Sweet. Alright. But I've also got my US one

170
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:11,120
preorder cool anything else that you're playing this week Loki Grand Theft Auto

171
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,520
lots of Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stores because I just can't get enough

172
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,520
that game we've been playing all the death matches again we're actually kind

173
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:23,400
of playing now with the cheat device a little bit because one of the things you

174
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:28,200
can do the cheat devices manipulate the gravity in the game and it'll actually

175
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,700
you can unload the cheat device and launch a multiplayer game with the

176
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:37,780
gravity in place. So I for instance could have like 0.1 gravity and other people could

177
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:45,360
be having just normal gravity and I'll jump way the fuck over them. So it's kind of fun.

178
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,380
My gaming week has been nothing that special. I haven't really bought a new game. I thought

179
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:55,100
about buying the Mega Man X collection because you know the Mega Man X collection came out

180
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,740
this week. And then I was reminded by some reviews out there on the internet that, oh

181
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:04,020
Megaman x4 and 5 kind of sucked so I

182
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:09,020
Make it an x4 was kind of cool. Wait. No, I'm sorry five and six X

183
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,780
But what was the last night last night had the sucker in it?

184
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:15,980
Okay, I take it back x5 and x6 kind of sucked but then like well x1 was kind of cool

185
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,100
Do I really want to pay all this again just to play?

186
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:25,500
You know x1 if you want to get Megaman x1 get Megaman powered up or Maverick hunter X the remake for the PSP

187
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,140
That's like 20 bucks. Is that out now? I

188
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,660
I think it's coming out the first week in February.

189
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,060
I saw some screens of that. That looked pretty hot.

190
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,380
And I liked the whole design your own level mode.

191
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,700
That's Mega Man Power.Mega Man, that's not...

192
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,820
Oh, am I getting him backwards? My bad.

193
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,820
Actually, I did want to ask you something about that.

194
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,300
It's all the X games, right?

195
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:51,460
Yeah, it's X1 through 6, and then they also put in something, some battle game.

196
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,660
Oh, Rockman the Power Battles?

197
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,340
No, because that was in the first one.

198
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,820
No, it's the Mario Kart type game.

199
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:01,200
Oh, okay. Battle and chase. That's it, battle and chase.

200
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,160
Did you give X3 a try? Did it have the stupid box around it?

201
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:10,640
Oh, I didn't actually play it. I thought about buying it. I didn't actually. Well, the thing is that I have Mega Man X3 on Saturn

202
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,080
and we know it was also on the Super Nintendo or Super Primacon.

203
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:19,000
The thing is that it put this weird box around it and it looks just like the Super Nintendo version.

204
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,360
So I was asking if they gave it the same treatment. No idea.

205
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,120
Maybe somebody in chat knows. Speaking of chat, chat has some feedback to what we've

206
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,320
been talking about so far.

207
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,120
For instance, Jaded2006 had a comment on Nintendogs.

208
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,920
Nintendogs died because nobody wanted another pet rock.

209
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,560
Kinda true there.

210
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,000
Another point here, somebody made a point on Phantasy Star

211
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,360
Online, I think it was Rini. Rini said,

212
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,840
Loki, don't forget, even Phantasy Star Online charges you per month

213
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,560
as well on top of the Xbox Live fees, at least the regular Xbox version does.

214
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,280
But that's the one good thing about this whole like silver and gold thing that I

215
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,760
see is that now we won't have that anymore, because that was my complaint about

216
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,160
PSO on the Xbox too,

217
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,880
which is too bad because PSO on the Xbox is like my favorite version.

218
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,840
I did like the one on PC a whole lot, but Xbox had voice chat, come on.

219
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,800
I was just... I guess you could use Teamspeak and stuff with the PC, but I don't know,

220
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,360
there's something

221
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,280
about having it all streamlined that's great. I'm hoping that there's gonna be an

222
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,560
MMO coming out that's actually, you know,

223
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,600
when you pay for gold, it's basically the same fee.

224
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,840
It's applied to it, so I don't have to pay these extra fees.

225
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,840

226
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,760
Speaking of MMOs,

227
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,680
one other game I've been playing this week, a lot more World of Warcraft,

228
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,120
because,

229
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,400
you know, Miek Latov, who was here on the show last week, convinced me to come back

230
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,040
after my little hiatus, so I've been playing on his server,

231
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,520
and I did our first instance.

232
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,480
well I think I think that's what you call it when you do the dungeon with

233
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,400
with party that's not high level we're only like level I think about about 16

234
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,040
17

235
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,160
and we're doing like a low-level dungeon I think they call it an instant still

236
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,660
yeah cuz like a you know harder quest it was actually a lot of fun

237
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:01,280
well the reason they're called instances because each dungeons loaded up for just

238
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,120
your party I

239
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,240
thought so I see it's a somebody was trying to tell me that was only in

240
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,520
Guild Wars that that happened and that's true Guild Wars does that too but

241
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,280
yeah I I realize that because none of the creatures were responding

242
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:18,200
When we were going through the dungeon and I was like maybe this is like just for us when we go through yeah

243
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,280
And that sure is so I like that was fun because the last time I play World of Warcraft

244
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:27,360
I didn't I only got to like level 20 with one character and I didn't have a lot of other people I knew on the

245
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,760
Server and I can be really anti-social on MMOs

246
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,040
because like this is this is what they talk about in MMOs you sit there in the middle of the town and they're all talking about

247
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,920
Chuck Norris and the you know the Chuck Norris facts website and it's like come on

248
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,560
They're all acting like there's I don't want to talk to those people

249
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,560
My roommate showed me how to block out the general chat.

250
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,560
Yeah, please!

251
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,560
G H, please.

252
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,560
No, and this one, they're all shouting for instances, you know.

253
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,560
WC party, need healer.

254
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,560
RFC party, need healer.

255
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,560
So now everybody knows I'm Horde on some server, because those are Horde quests.

256
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,560
Anyway.

257
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,560
Let's get into tonight's news, shall we?

258
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,560
Alright, the news.

259
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,560
Starting off the news tonight. Let's talk about the Gizmondo.

260
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,340
about the gizmondo gizmondo is one of those things we saw at e3 and we were

261
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:15,240
kind of like hey this this looks like it could be pretty cool well it is mondo

262
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,400
well dark soccer what's going on with the gizmondo well it looks like Tiger

263
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:26,600
telematics which is the parent company handling gizmondo stated that they've

264
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:32,520
offered the stock IP and patents of smart ads subsidiary as an equity on a

265
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:37,040
on a 21.2 million loan from their shareholders.

266
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,880
Oopsie!

267
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,080
Uh-oh, you mean the ad service wasn't a hit?

268
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,340
Okay, basically the terms of the deal,

269
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,840
the loan that was overdue to be repaid,

270
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,100
and also just for our UK listeners,

271
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,640
that's 12.68 million pounds.

272
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,240
You know what this is like?

273
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,720
This is like friends of mine who have been

274
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,440
in very bad financial situations.

275
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,680
They have to sell their car to pay the rent.

276
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,600
That's kind of what this sounds like to me.

277
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,400
Well, now, the catch on this one is that the loan

278
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,640
has to be repaid by March 30th, unless Tiger

279
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:17,080
can raise $75 million in new equity or debt by that date.

280
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,400
Then the company says it's working on securing that.

281
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:27,680
If it can get the $75 million, then $1.68 million of the loan

282
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,400
must be repaid immediately in the remainder

283
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,600
to come before June 30th.

284
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,280
And if the company doesn't get it or can't repay it, the two shareholders will be taking

285
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,280
over the smart ad system.

286
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,840
You know, we could save this company.

287
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,840
What?

288
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,160
It's the same thing that saved other companies, sidetalking.

289
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,720
Did you have something additional in this?

290
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,720
No, I don't.

291
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,720
No, nothing additional?

292
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,880
Nothing additional other than, I'm not surprised.

293
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,480
Why did the Gizmondo fail?

294
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,000
Why did the Betamax fail?

295
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,180
I think the Gizmondo failed because they didn't really have any

296
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,540
big-name games to kind of draw us to the system. You know, the

297
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:11,140
system's only as good as the games that are on it, right? And we saw this one game,

298
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,240
Johnny, whatever, that looked,

299
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,000
you know, whatever, it looked okay. But there was no, but there was no, like,

300
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,320
big draw, but it wasn't a big draw, you know what I mean?

301
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,480
And I never once, walking into a

302
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,600
a large store, like Best Buy, Fry, never once

303
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,560
have I seen a setup for Gizmondo. Well, Gizmondo, the problem with it also was

304
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,280
the games that were launching on it were

305
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,800
last-generation games. Also they have this wonderful

306
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,320
ad service in there where you have to watch ads in order to shut your system off.

307
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,800
Oh, I remember that. Ooh, that's fun. And also possibly talking about a redesign of

308
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,720
the system before the system launches.

309
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,800
Well, that's a great idea. That'll get people to buy your system.

310
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:55,400
Alright. Well, at least their system came out. That's more than we could say

311
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,000
about

312
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,720
about the Phantom. Exactly. Well, it's not over till it's over, but

313
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,200
you know, it's over. Moving on, other stories. I have a story here about the

314
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,080
ninth annual

315
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,800
Interactive Achievement Awards, because you know, it's award season,

316
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:15,060
and there's, you know, this group, the Interactive Achievement Awards,

317
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:19,020
they're handing out awards, and here's what's nominated for Game of the Year.

318
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,200
God of War,

319
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,360
Guitar Hero, Shadow of the Colossus,

320
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,560
Call of Duty 2 and Nintendogs, you notice what's missing from this list?

321
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,680
Resident Evil 4, which is getting a lot of awards.

322
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,760
So it's kind of interesting. And I don't know, maybe it missed the eligibility point or

323
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,280
something, because

324
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:40,040
Resident Evil 4 came out really, really early in 2005, so maybe it just narrowly missed some

325
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,720
type of

326
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,280
eligibility window, I don't know. Computer Games nominated,

327
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,600
Fear, Civilization 4, Battlefield 2,

328
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,580
Age of Empires 3, and the movies. Just a whole, whole lot of categories here. I'm

329
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,220
I'm obviously not going to sit here and read them all, but I thought it was interesting

330
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:59,320
because they have a cellular game of the year and nobody really ever talks about cell phone

331
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:04,780
games because most of them suck, but this might clue you into what a couple of the good

332
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:12,700
ones are, Mile High Pinball, Skipping Stone, 1, Ancient Empires 2, and High Seas, none

333
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:17,200
of which I've ever heard of on my cell phone, but I have Sprint and they have like different

334
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,660
games than the other people I think.

335
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,060
I always delete them, I like have Bejeweled on my phone or something.

336
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,260
I had bejeweled multiplayer for a little while, and it was alright.

337
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:29,060
I had Castlevania on the cell phone, which was cool for like five minutes, because it

338
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:32,100
was like, dude, it's just like Castlevania 1, but then you realize I'm trying to play

339
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:37,020
a game on my cell phone, and the action is like, so choppy, it's pretty bad.

340
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:41,540
So it's one of those things, like, I got this to listen to the theme music once in a while.

341
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,940
I don't know.

342
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,460
I don't know what else there is to say about that.

343
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:49,860
Moving on, Loki, what's going on in Nintendo's world?

344
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:56,860
Speaking of things that are new for this year, well, they've basically come out, Reggie, he

345
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:03,780
likes to talk up their new systems coming out and stuff, and kind of gave a bit, talking

346
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:09,780
to Sina, he kind of showed what their focus was for this year, mainly the stuff that they're

347
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,940
kind of trying to do with the revolution.

348
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:19,640
For example, they want to basically make their system more approachable to everybody by first

349
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,120
having a lower price tag than everybody else and also just kind of

350
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,880
probably making sure they have enough units out there and maybe launching on

351
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,880
time for everyone

352
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,080
you know what's interesting is that I seem to remember that was a big part of

353
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,420
their um...

354
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,480
talk behind that controller when they first showed the pictures of the

355
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,320
revolution controller they were like hey

356
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,720
everybody's used a TV remote so this makes it kind of accessible to everybody

357
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,380
which is an interesting argument yeah that way it's so anybody you know your grandma

358
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:48,880
can go pick up this game and figure out how to do this okay

359
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,400
If I need to slash a sword, I make a motion like I'm slashing a sword. It makes perfect sense.

360
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,160
Also, they're just basically focusing on entertainment

361
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,320
because, you know, the whole thing is no matter, you know, what your specs are of

362
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,520
course it's

363
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,000
you know, what we've been saying before, your console's only as good as the games.

364
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,880
So, focus on the good games and

365
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,440
pretty much

366
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,280
you know, that's about it. It's basically just

367
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,160
focusing on entertainment, making sure that their product is accessible to everybody

368
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,680
and that's how they think they're gonna win the next-gen

369
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,880
did he say anything about actually putting out twilight princess this year

370
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,980
that should be one of their goals i think

371
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,660
who have you noticed all has been kind of quiet on the twilight princess front

372
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,200
i don't know if this is still coming up still cut because we're in a quiet

373
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,300
period right now it's kind of a slow news period right now

374
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,940
but i don't know is just what will you laughing over there i'm laughing at the

375
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:40,060
book reference now

376
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,980
but i had to read that

377
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,820
anyway

378
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,820
uh... but no i

379
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,140
i think that

380
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:49,300
the point that they start being very quiet about something that either means

381
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,740
one or two things, something's going very well

382
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:55,420
or something is going horrendously wrong. What do you think is the case in the

383
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:58,260
PlayStation 3 which has also been very very quiet lately?

384
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:01,740
Horribly wrong. I've got theories on this one but

385
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,900
my comments on that are coming up on later issues. Alright fine.

386
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,900
My thing is I think they're starting to get towards the end here

387
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,860
they're starting to get towards their dates that they said they were

388
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,780
gonna hit and they're nowhere near hitting those dates and

389
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:23,540
I think that it's a bad sign right now seen is that none of the actual alpha kits have gone out for the PS3 and

390
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:28,440
So far we haven't yet to see an actual playable demo or anything. That's actually running

391
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:34,160
you know while we've seen some you know demos running on the hardware, but nothing playable and

392
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,520
The fact that you know the beta kits aren't even out this thing's nowhere near production

393
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,400
No one knows what the cost is no one knows when it's coming out. I I'm not even sure it's coming out this year

394
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:50,080
Interesting feedback here from SSJ 100 Matt, Nintendo's stocks are up six percent

395
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,480
and I do remember reading an article on this is that after there was that big

396
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,400
spiel about you know Nintendo will or the revolution will not be above this

397
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,120
price the stocks went up. I remember reading somewhere on the internet I don't

398
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,920
think the story made the cut for tonight but I remember seeing that somewhere on

399
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,680
the internet I thought it was kind of neat. Now I'm not sure if they're gonna be able to do

400
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:11,760
under $299 but let's just say they do $199 that thing's gonna fly off shelves

401
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,720
it's gonna be flying especially when you consider what you know that's like

402
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,640
three games for the 360

403
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,880
yeah it it's gonna be but you also have to consider what do you get with it

404
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,920
you know like is it gonna be $1.99 and then you have to buy

405
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:29,480
a controller and you know some other stuff on top of you know what are you getting for

406
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,120
that $1.99? Wait, you're getting the controller plus the nunchuck attachment

407
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,100
and they're also going to be having speculation this is all speculation of

408
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,200
course. Well that's what they've said

409
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,280
that's going to be included with it. You read something I did?

410
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:45,920
well this was a while back, they're also gonna be having you know obviously the service

411
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,840
we can play the old retro games I'm sure that they're gonna have

412
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,880
you know some of those you can play for free as well as some

413
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,000
that you could probably pay for the service and stuff

414
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,960
but probably gonna have a couple launch games

415
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,760
but I think it's not going to be as expensive because if you look at even

416
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,640
GameCube games and look at

417
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,960
Nintendo DS games and stuff, they're never as expensive as PSP games or

418
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,640
anything like that and I understand okay maybe the graphics are as good

419
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,560
So what? But it's still a game. It's not as expensive, though.

420
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:18,220
The highest I ever see a Nintendo DS game is usually about

421
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:21,480
$35. I'd say about $35 is as high as I've seen it, too.

422
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,520
I think that's what I paid for, um...

423
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,360
Oh, hell. Kirby!

424
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,040
Oh, not Kirby, because that was a present.

425
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,800
I know there's something I bought that was $35. I had to probably touch and go when I

426
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,480
first bought it.

427
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,800
Yeah. That's why I got it confused. It's the same game. It's just Kirby's a lot better.

428
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,940
yeah anyway moving on

429
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,260
I'm now a follow-up to something we talked about last week we talked about

430
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:48,080
this Nintendo DS redesign was on the way and

431
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,100
and there's gonna be this whole great announcement on Monday and then what

432
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:51,960
happened Loki

433
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,660
I have a Monday the only answer was that there's not a redesign Christian say

434
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,880
there wasn't going to be redesigned so

435
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,460
ever they say there was a new be really never they basically said

436
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:05,260
I'm we have no news to basically a

437
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:08,380
you know our system is awesome we have no news

438
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:11,780
regarding, you know, redesign. It says

439
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,780
but we have nothing to announce at this time. Nothing to announce

440
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:19,420
at this time. That's the key word. Meaning that there is going to be a redesign just not right

441
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,800
now. Probably something that they'll save for E3

442
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,380
or if there is going to be a redesign. Nintendo cannot

443
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:29,060
they cannot stand to leave something alone. There's always going to be a redesign.

444
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:32,860
You know what? I've seen great, great arguments out there on the internet

445
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,340
though

446
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:37,740
you know when people were debunking this. It's like, you know, if it's not broke, why fix

447
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:42,380
DS's are still selling like hell and somebody else sent me an article that also didn't make

448
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:46,700
the cut for tonight, but talking about how the Japanese are really really pushing to

449
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:52,020
get DS's back on shelves, they're even importing them back in the country and just crazy stuff,

450
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,020
you know.

451
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,360
So if it's not broke, why fix it?

452
00:27:54,360 --> 00:28:00,500
They won't need to put out a new DS until DS sales slow down, which as long as they

453
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,580
keep putting out really solid games for it, probably isn't going to happen anytime soon.

454
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:07,420
With Tetris DS right around the corner, I think that's going to be a big motivator for

455
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:10,500
more systems. All they would have to do to make more of those systems fly out the

456
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:10,940
shells,

457
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:15,260
shoot, do another $20 price cut. Tetris DS and you also have

458
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:19,540
same month is gonna be Metroid Prime hunters. It's gonna be a huge month

459
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,780
for DS. And what's PSP got on the horizon?

460
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:26,580
What's PSP have? They have the new Splinter Cell Essentials.

461
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,820
Katamari is coming out in March.

462
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:34,540
They've got a new... I'm trying to think if there's anything else that is really big.

463
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:37,640
They have a lot of, there's 29 games for the PSP coming out

464
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,520
in March, so I mean that's a lot of stuff.

465
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:45,720
You know, speaking of DS, it's not on the outline for tonight's show, but

466
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,960
you had something about

467
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,160
Phoenix Wright, the DS game. What happened with this?

468
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:54,160
Another too popular for its own good? It is too popular for its own good,

469
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,360
and unfortunately if you don't have one right now and there are none

470
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,440
in your local store, you're not going to be seeing it until March. Because,

471
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,080
um like most Japanese games they get produced in Japan it's gonna be a six

472
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,200
week turnaround time

473
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,440
because Capcom is sold out of them right now

474
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,560
and no way you can get one until

475
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,760
March well yeah February March ish

476
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:23,180
well well well crazy alright well enough about what's going on in Japan and over

477
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:27,120
here in the US how about our buddies over in the UK dark soccer like to keep

478
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,520
tabs on what's going on

479
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:32,080
overseas the other way and fills us in with

480
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:37,160
the UK report. Well, we actually have an update

481
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:41,400
that the UK DS sales reached 1 million.

482
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,440
They have surpassed that 1 million unit sale,

483
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,160
which is pretty big since it's been out less than a year

484
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,680
over there.

485
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,040
They said that several of the major retailers

486
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,600
in the UK were completely sold out of the systems too

487
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,720
and so people have to wait for quite a while.

488
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:09,040
World wide sales are a good bit higher than 13 million now.

489
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,520
Wow, Nintendo just

490
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,920
knows how to do their handhelds, what can you say? Yeah, they are the pros.

491
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:21,560
Also, Dead or Alive 4 has a UK release date.

492
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,520
They said it will ship on January 27th.

493
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,720
For those of you guys that need your booby fix, it's on its way.

494
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:36,640
I warn you, the whole reaction system in that, that game's a pain in the ass.

495
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,360
And it's all, the last boss is the biggest cheeseball in the universe.

496
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,480
I'd like to mention something real quick about DOA4 that makes no sense to me.

497
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:49,440
Okay, I was playing that game, and there was one cutscene that they have where one of the

498
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,040
female characters is trying to buy a head of lettuce.

499
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:59,120
And this other female character, who seemed to be of royalty or something, took the lettuce

500
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,320
away from her, and then they fought.

501
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,440
What the hell is that for a story?

502
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,860
They're fighting over a goddamn head of lettuce.

503
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,860
That was so retarded.

504
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:10,160
And by the way, their boob's about way too much in this game still.

505
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,560
On the next Jerry Springer.

506
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,480
No, you have to set the age.

507
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,160
We've got the age set to 30, I think.

508
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,160
Because of Dan.

509
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,280
Because he likes bouncy boobies.

510
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,160
Oh wait, you actually set the age.

511
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,200
I haven't played this yet, so you set the age and that...

512
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:29,560
Yeah, if you don't want a lot of, you know, bouncy boobs and panty shots, then you can

513
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,720
set the age to, like, one.

514
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,280
So if you set it to, like, 70, it's, like, really perverted?

515
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:39,280
I think the highest it goes is 30, but, um, the last DOA game had, uh, an unlock that

516
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:43,420
you could put your age to 99, and it was like... everywhere.

517
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,840
So your age determines the bounce.

518
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,840
That's, uh, weird.

519
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,840
Yeah.

520
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,600
Anything else in the UK?

521
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,220
yes actually a game I'm actually pretty excited about in fact I'm

522
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:57,460
I might be doing something regarding

523
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:00,660
a translation of this game for the US but

524
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:04,020
that's another story. Tales of Fantasia

525
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,100
a Japanese RPG is going to be out on the

526
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:13,060
Gameboy in March in the UK and I'm actually pretty excited about that game

527
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:17,360
because Tales of Fantasia has a pretty unique battle system

528
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,920
I've seen a bit of it in action, the Japanese version, pretty cool intro too.

529
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:26,960
But it was out on the Super Famicom

530
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,840
back in the day. And of course, was it Tales of Symphonia?

531
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:36,040
And another game, one on PlayStation 2 and the other on GameCube

532
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,080
came out in the United States but we never did see Tales of Fantasia.

533
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:43,920
So I think it's pretty exciting that there's going to be a release for that on

534
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,240
the Game Boy Advance.

535
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,020
Of course, it's gonna be out in Europe at the end of March very cool

536
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:52,380
And then the United States sometime beginning the March very cool

537
00:32:53,220 --> 00:33:00,460
All right. Thank you for that. Mark. Sakura. You're quite welcome. Our folks overseas. Appreciate you. They better they better appreciate you guys

538
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:04,340
All right, you know interesting comment here in the chat room

539
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:11,900
Summing up the dead or alive for story that Loki was telling us about dark Tetsuya says DOA for has a story

540
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:18,020
I think perfectly sums it up right there it's all about John Lee's ending which

541
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:23,100
is hilarious blink blink I'm not gonna spoil it because people have to get the

542
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:30,260
game and play it but it's like trumpet what's up with that fine all right

543
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:34,900
moving on to another article speaking of something coming out for the Game Boy

544
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:40,900
Advance pretty soon we've got Dr. Sudoku there's a brand new title coming out

545
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:45,040
based off Sudoku you know what Sudoku is right it's that puzzle game that has the

546
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:49,380
one through nine and you you you can only use each number once in a row and

547
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,720
in a column and in each nine three by three box and you can't go into a Barnes

548
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,060
and Noble without finding books on it everywhere exactly it's this huge puzzle

549
00:33:56,060 --> 00:34:01,020
craze so of course you know they think hmm puzzle Game Boy Advance Tetris

550
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:06,220
best-selling game well shit we need to put Sudoku out there so Dr. Sudoku is

551
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:11,220
coming out in February it's got more than 1,000 puzzles and of course will be

552
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:16,500
the first of many many Sudoku games to hit various game systems just like

553
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:21,940
Tetris just like World Championship poker games and all that stuff what do

554
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:28,020
you think next big thing or just whatever maybe if I ignore it it'll go

555
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:32,820
away you know what's interesting I don't understand like the sudden interest in

556
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,540
Sudoku because these puzzle books that they've sold in store I remember these

557
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:40,020
from when I was younger like you know I was such a nerd that my parents could

558
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:44,060
buy me one of these books and we would go on a road trip and I'd shut up for a

559
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:50,160
long time and these Sudoku puzzles appeared in the books I want to say

560
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,560
it's like penny press or somebody puts out these books you can get them in

561
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,660
supermarkets these Sudoku puzzles appeared in these books a long time ago

562
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,220
except they were called something else had something with a more English title

563
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:02,020
like it was like crypto numbers or something was like the name of the

564
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:06,940
puzzles and why now is this stuff all the rage that's what I I'm not getting

565
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:12,100
people are trend whores I guess but it's just really weird you know and I'll

566
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:15,860
admit I've done a couple Sudoku puzzles like recently I was in a waiting room

567
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,940
for a long time and I was like you know there's New York Times and I was like oh

568
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:24,940
Sudoku I'll do the puzzle there but I don't know I can't see myself spending

569
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:28,180
money to buy this on Game Boy Advance you know I do think it's popularity is

570
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,860
a good thing because it's something that encourages people to actually use their

571
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:38,260
brains true true but you know I don't know I but it also to me Game Boy

572
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:42,700
Advance wouldn't match for me just the pen and paper version of doing it you

573
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:48,060
know imagine that having fun with pen and paper I know it's a it's a strange

574
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:53,300
concept for some gamer folks but you know go figure well you know there are

575
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:58,420
people who have actually forgotten how to write from typing so much hmm it

576
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:02,020
actually is a sort of epidemic thing in Japan where people have forgotten how to

577
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:08,260
write certain kanji because when you type you can select it from a list

578
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:13,140
interesting comment I'm reading chatroom for some comments on Sudoku Rini says

579
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:17,860
that Dr. Sudoku will be a battery drainer let's see

580
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:22,480
Ninst says it's the rage now because someone slapped a foreign word on it so

581
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,320
yes whores and Zander C has the same thing it's popular now because it has

582
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,400
the Japanese name now and then of course Wonder Dog Harold says they should have

583
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:36,480
a Pokemon Sudoku game that's nice that's how they sold Tetris attack nobody

584
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,160
bought Tetris attack on as well a couple people did but not a lot of people bought

585
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,280
Tetris attack when it was first out and had Yoshi and stuff slap some Pokemon

586
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,640
characters on it put it on the n64 Pokemon puzzle league is that why

587
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:52,000
Tetris DS has the retro Mario and Zelda characters in it probably probably and

588
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,120
and then of course we have VX Jason XV our lovely webmaster we love him in

589
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:57,720
chat says

590
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:02,080
you can't erase paper get an eraser mate get one of those eraser mate pens

591
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:06,320
yes you can erase paper that's part of the frustration of Sudoku

592
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,720
at least a couple times I did it alright anyway

593
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,560
moving on I did Sudoku once but I'm trying to cut back

594
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,920
I know it sounds it sounds kinda scandalous doesn't it Sudoku

595
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:24,920
Loki, what's going on in the movie world? We have, oh my god, House of the Dead 2?

596
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,920
They're making a House of the Dead 2?

597
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,920
That was exactly my reaction.

598
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,920
Dear God, why?

599
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,920
When I saw it on our list of movies, you know, upcoming movies, I was like,

600
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,920
why the hell would they make a sequel to that? Didn't they lose enough money on the first one?

601
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,920
And it's not U.E. Bull this time.

602
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,920
It's not U.E. Bull.

603
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,920
So it might be good.

604
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,920
It might be that rare sequel that's better than the original.

605
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,960
are you have to remember it's not just a director that ruins a movie okay you

606
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:54,920
have the same writers as the you know alone the dark and house the dead in

607
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:58,320
this one it's also scary as you have these same writers are doing a dead or

608
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,480
alive movie as if you couldn't tell that one was gonna suck now what's great

609
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,020
though is this movie it says it picks up where the last film left off where the

610
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:11,720
government operatives investigate the island and the mysterious house so in

611
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:17,680
In other words, the first game, because the last one was a prequel to everything.

612
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,160
So is that like Jurassic Park 2 when they went back to the island to research the dinosaurs?

613
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,160
I don't know, but...

614
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,640
Are they going to whip out keyboards and have letters pop up in front of the zombies, or...

615
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,640
Is Julianne Moore going to be in it, because, you know...

616
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,480
No, not Julianne Moore, but you have sticky fingers, is going to be it.

617
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,480
Oh, God.

618
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,120
I just hope it has some of the cheeseball dialogue that was in the game.

619
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,520
There was nothing we could do.

620
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,520
Let me play this way, folks.

621
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:42,360
if you're gonna if do not buy this when it comes out on DVD instead you can

622
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,200
watch it for free when it premieres on sci-fi on

623
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,120
February 11th. Yeah but it won't have titty on sci-fi. Well it's not gonna have titty anyways

624
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,040
probably

625
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:54,960
well actually no nudity and brief sexuality okay well yeah so no nudity

626
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,320
in the sci-fi version but really are you missing anything no you're not

627
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,600
but it might be one of those movies is so bad it's good

628
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:05,400
you know like one of my favorite like blood rain like showgirls one of my

629
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,900
favorite movies of all time

630
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:11,400
So bad, it's good. No, it's it's and like if you watch it on vh1

631
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:16,700
It's even worse because they draw the bras on and everything. I love showgirls because so so bad

632
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,760
Anyways, you don't know shit if you are, you know, if you are masochist when it comes to actually

633
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:28,500
You're watching these movies. The DVD will be released in United States on March 21st

634
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:34,420
as well as also debuting on sci-fi channel on February 11th, so check it out.

635
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:39,460
Well let me set my TiVo now. Let's talk about a more promising movie, shall we?

636
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:46,100
Let's talk about Silent Hill. The trailer hit the internet this week and it's

637
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:49,780
getting a really good reaction. I've already made two icons from it.

638
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:54,340
Have you seen that the Silent Hill website now is updated and changed?

639
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:57,740
It looks awesome. They did this whole flash thing with it where it

640
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:00,820
looks all nice at first and like it was creepy on you all of a sudden and they

641
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:04,580
got like cool backdrops and stuff it's welcome to silent Hill calm did you did

642
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:08,300
you guys all watch the trailer yes what you think yes I did as I made to I call

643
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:13,380
it you know I had to ask yeah oh it looks like it's for a lot of the stuff

644
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:17,620
in it has the same feel that the games do mm-hmm and like especially the scenes

645
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:24,140
with the nurses mm-hmm oh yeah that's yeah and pyramid head I it's it's great

646
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:29,020
because it seems like it really is gonna be a great video game adaptation.

647
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,980
These guys paid attention to the games.

648
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:36,640
And granted the story's a lot different, but we kind of have the characters from Silent

649
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:42,100
Hill 1 in a way, or the ambiance of Silent Hill 1 and the music.

650
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:46,160
We have a lot of the characters from Silent Hill 2, and then kind of the look of Silent

651
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,660
Hill 3 towards the end of the trailer, it looks a lot like Silent Hill 3, so it's kind

652
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,460
of got all of that.

653
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:56,420
signs of Silent Hill 4, but I suppose they want to leave room for a sequel or something.

654
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:59,740
But the cool thing I thought about the trailer was that they used music from the games in

655
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:05,500
the trailer, and we heard that Akira was going to do the soundtrack, then he wasn't, then

656
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,820
some other guy was going to do it, and it was going to be inspired by Akira Yomoka's

657
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:09,820
original score.

658
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:13,380
So I don't know if this is some of the score that's actually going to be in the movie,

659
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,380
but this is it.

660
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:17,380
This is great, because somebody just basically re-recorded what Akira Yomoka did.

661
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,380
It's awesome.

662
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,620
It fits the trailer very well.

663
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:23,980
He said he's going to be using elements from the original, so I think that that's more

664
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,620
where we got a lot of that from.

665
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:29,900
Well, usually I don't run out to go see these movies, but this one's actually one I'm looking

666
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,980
forward to.

667
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:37,500
The trailer's a little eh, but as far as the way they did it, it makes it a little cheesy.

668
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:42,420
But it looks good, and especially if you watch the teaser, the way they did the teaser trailer,

669
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,420
it's really...

670
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,060
The teaser was awesome.

671
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,060
That was awesome.

672
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:48,340
That had the total style of Silent Hill and everything.

673
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,860
And especially towards the end of the trailer when they show Pyramid Head again, you know,

674
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,820
it's going to be just awesome.

675
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:58,540
I'm scared I'm going to be really let down, because my expectations now are so, so high

676
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,860
for this movie.

677
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,700
I'm really scared I'm going to get let down by it.

678
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:06,640
I think it's one of those films, at some point they're going to have to be good.

679
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,020
They're going to have to start being good, and I think what people need is a movie that

680
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:15,140
set the bar so that people will stop going to see these piece of crap movies that we

681
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:20,220
Bowl puts out, because they're really bad and they need to like have some people out

682
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:24,360
there go, you know what, this is what a video game movie should look like, I'm not paying

683
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:28,360
to see this crap, stop putting this crap out, you know, talk to these studios, that's what

684
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,360
they need to be doing.

685
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:35,460
I honestly, I would have to say, because they would have to get that degree of accuracy

686
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:41,940
and to keep the story that far in line, they'd have to be working fairly close with the creating

687
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:42,940
team out of Konami.

688
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:47,500
Well, you know the Konami logo shows up at the end of the trailer, so that was kinda cool, so...

689
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:51,300
I mean, I suppose that's a property rights thing anyway, but, you know, I'm still promising.

690
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:55,820
But that also offers hope, though, that if Konami is getting in on that and making it so...

691
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,300
good, you know?

692
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,580
That they won't fuck up Metal Gear?

693
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,180
I'm- I- I want...

694
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,460
Or Castlevania, which we-

695
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,460
I want so bad for a Metal Gear movie.

696
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:07,340
Yeah, but you heard those rumors that U.E. Bull was looking at the script?

697
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,900
I don't know, I think it was just rumors that started by somebody.

698
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:15,880
I think that in this case, I really pray that his reputation is a heated we'll see

699
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:23,720
Alright moving on now, you know, there's lots of things that lazy people do and one of them is watching a lot of movies

700
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:28,120
One thing could be playing a lot of games. In fact, one of these

701
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:34,200
Folks who lost a lot of weight recently has been in the media says that games made him fat right Loki

702
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,820
What's going on with this?

703
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:37,520
well

704
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:43,800
Jared and he was apparently a big Nintendo fan Jared like the subway guy. Yeah. Oh, okay that guy

705
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:49,680
Yeah, he he was a big Nintendo fan a big fan. But anyways, yeah apparently

706
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,680
little too addicted to the home console system and

707
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:01,380
Didn't really he ended up being about nearly 425 pounds just sitting there playing his Nintendo

708
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:06,380
No, I don't think Nintendo is the sole thing to blame here, obviously.

709
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:13,380
He needs to be blaming himself for not getting his ass up off the couch and going outside and exercising.

710
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:17,380
He has himself to blame, and trust me, I've lost 80 pounds.

711
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:24,380
I know that what it took from me was getting my ass up off from in front of the TV and going and working out and eating right.

712
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:26,380
He had to have done the same thing, right?

713
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:32,740
right yeah he says he had um you know one hand on the controller one hand in a

714
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:37,660
bag of chips so you know who we need to come in after potato chips they're the

715
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:42,300
root of all evil to take responsibility for himself and you blame it on his own

716
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:48,060
personal weakness people themselves are responsible for their own health okay

717
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:53,340
here here devil's advocate for a minute is Nintendo and enabler or video games

718
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,340
in general.

719
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:55,340
It was still his choice.

720
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:56,340
It was just there.

721
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:57,340
No.

722
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:59,700
It's the same thing as sitting and watching pay per view all day.

723
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,280
I kind of call it the same thing.

724
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,900
Video games in that regard are no different from sitting on the couch watching pay per

725
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:15,860
view, porn, wrestling, porn, internet, chat rooms, you know, it's all the same.

726
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:24,160
It was his choice to sit and play the game, and it was his choice to eat potato chips,

727
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:30,160
his choice the types of, and then to his credit he made the decision to do something different.

728
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:36,540
He decided one day to get up and eat something better, even if it was Subway, God, Togo's

729
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:44,740
is so much better, but he made the decision to put some effort and take responsibility

730
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:45,740
for himself.

731
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:55,580
go back and blame Nintendo for his obesity? Just completely cast a big shadow over all

732
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:56,580
of what he's done.

733
00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:00,580
At the same time though, is the gamer community taking this one little quote and blowing it

734
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:01,580
completely out of context?

735
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:04,900
I think it is. I think it's just a spin on the story. I'm sure it's probably something

736
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:08,980
like, you know, how did you know I used to sit around playing my Nintendo. I think he

737
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:12,660
was just probably trying to point out that he was lazy and eating, you know, he wasn't

738
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:16,660
eating right, and someone's like, oh, he said Nintendo, oh, it's all their fault.

739
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:20,060
I'm kind of seeing it a little bit like that, too. I mean, we can kind of poke fun,

740
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:23,940
but in a realistic way is that, you know what, use Jared as an example that, you

741
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:24,740
know, if you

742
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:28,380
are feeling fat, you should put down the controller and

743
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:32,260
go walk, because he said, it wasn't, he says that it's not just Subway that made him

744
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:34,540
thinner, it was getting up and walking, going on walks.

745
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:37,580
I need to actually quote Legend of Zaku here, because I

746
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:40,700
fully believe this. I'm going to, big, happy quote for me, yeah.

747
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:45,760
America, the land that personal responsibility forgot.

748
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,600
You know, it says though, since he did

749
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:54,860
was almost 425 pounds. He would have been about 600 pounds, though, if he were playing World of

750
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:56,340
Warcraft instead of Nintendo.

751
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:59,600
I know, just think about if they had a World of Warcraft back then. Man, he'd be...

752
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:03,440
Alright, moving on. He'd be dead.

753
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,040
So, real quick, how much

754
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,160
gaming is too much and how can you prevent

755
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,200
yourself from being 400 pounds overweight

756
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,400
like Jared or whatever he wants I'm sorry I'm probably grossly over

757
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,200
exaggerating but

758
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,760
but how can you prevent yourself from being that overweight

759
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:23,760
well I was you know I was on my way there

760
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,420
unfortunately I moved out here from Alabama and

761
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:33,360
put on something like well actually I'm now under what I was when I

762
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:37,200
under what I would when I moved out here but I I did put on something like 70

763
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:37,800
pounds

764
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:41,680
and um, cause Dan and I are both gamers we

765
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:46,120
sat around playing Street Fighter all day seriously I mean I'm not joking it was

766
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,120
that or Castlevania Symphony of the Night

767
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:51,920
and um I finally hit my saturation point

768
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,720
in uh 2003 and said you know I can't go on this way anymore

769
00:47:55,720 --> 00:48:01,840
I right then and there I didn't consider it a diet I made a lifestyle change

770
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:05,280
You have to incorporate little changes into your life

771
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,800
and make them have it. Go outside the game.

772
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:13,840
Exactly. What you do, and I played DDR for a while. DDR was helpful. It was exercise.

773
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,200
It was fun and exercise.

774
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,440
But I learned to like going to the gym. I got involved in classes.

775
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:21,400
I worked out with my friends who were also. It's good to have a friend who has

776
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,720
the same goals as you.

777
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:26,000
But it's hard to really do it by yourself but

778
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,760
the main thing to remember is that if you see that your lifestyle right now is

779
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,980
causing you a problem

780
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:36,120
you need to change your lifestyle you don't need to say oh well I'm gonna go

781
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:36,920
on a diet

782
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:41,280
you know lose 20 pounds and say okay my diets done I won and then gain it all back

783
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:46,000
that's not how it works you know I have a really interesting observation on the

784
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:46,480
whole

785
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:51,480
gaming and diet thing see it was quite interesting to see before I used to play

786
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:55,600
like Final Fantasy 3 and stuff you know really long RPGs and I wouldn't really

787
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:59,200
you know get out and do anything then I went and played actual Qsar and that was a lot of

788
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,040
exercise and stuff

789
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:04,560
They stopped playing Qzard to play Final Fantasy 7 and 10 and stuff

790
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:09,260
and I got really lazy again. Then DDR came out and I started playing a lot of DDR and that got me

791
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:12,360
back to exercising. Then Final Fantasy 11 came around and I...

792
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:16,440
You wanna see a trend? It's all Final Fantasy's fault.

793
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:21,840
You know, along this, and I want to keep moving, but I did want to say this real quick

794
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:24,040
is that, you know, DDR is a great

795
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:27,240
revolution in games, but at the same time it's not the magic

796
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:30,460
weight loss program. You can't just

797
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:34,160
play DER and expect to drop 50 pounds.

798
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,760
I think, kinda like Jamie said, it's gotta be a bit of a lifestyle change to it.

799
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,720
You can't just play DDR for 15 minutes a day.

800
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:43,600
It'll help and you'll get some extra, but you're not gonna really,

801
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,920
it's not gonna be like this magic, just watch the fat fly, you know, it's

802
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,120
different. Now if you're doing what I was doing and playing DDR for an hour, hour and a half

803
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:56,380
every day, you know, after I got my, you remember when I got my long Dreamcast

804
00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:01,400
Back when I was playing DDR daily for an hour trying to beat the harder stuff

805
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:08,320
And it was that challenging myself is what kept me going finding personal satisfaction in the competitive side of it

806
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,960
Let me use a real-life scenario to kind of illustrate what I'm saying here

807
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:16,160
We sometimes me in a group and sometimes you guys would go and what have you just depend we used to go out every Wednesday

808
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:20,800
And we'd meet up at the arcade for DDR and whatever else and then after we were done

809
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,740
we would go to Brookfield's and dine on cheese sticks and soda and

810
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:28,260
and soup that's really high in fat and stuff

811
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:32,100
see that's what I'm saying is that you there was no change there

812
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:36,540
because you go play DDR and it's like damn that game made me hungry I'm gonna eat

813
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:40,620
I'm gonna eat a whole basket of cheese sticks by myself. I actually did these

814
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,240
way when we were doing that regularly

815
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,780
really but you weren't ordering the same stuff were you? Well no

816
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:48,680
but then again that was when I was also doing my I think I'm gonna be a

817
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,220
vegetarian now shtick

818
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:53,740
and then I went back to eating meat in 2003

819
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:56,960
yeah I did the vegetarian thing for two weeks too. And now my body's

820
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,180
forcing me into being a vegetarian, but that's just because of my antibiotics.

821
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:04,200
Alright, new subject, we gotta keep it moving here. We still have a lot we want to cover here

822
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:04,920
before we get a break.

823
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:08,840
Starting with Kojima.

824
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:12,120
You know Kojima, he's the guy that does Metal Gear. He did, John.

825
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:17,240
He has this kind of podcasting going on. Those of you guys that are into the podcasting

826
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,480
thing might get a kick outta this,

827
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:23,400
is that there's actually a podcast show that he's doing and

828
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:27,400
he even incorporates Solid Snake into it, which is kinda silly, but whatever.

829
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:34,400
It's over on Hideo Kojima's blog, which is www.blog.konami.jp

830
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,640
dot, I'm sorry, slash GS slash Hideo blog. You know what, just go to

831
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:42,240
blog.konami.jp, you'll find it. And it's also now in English as well.

832
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:46,180
You can find his own podcast show, and it's called

833
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:49,680
HIDECAN RADIO, okay? But it's not in English,

834
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:54,220
Okay, so you have to kind of understand at least a little bit of Japanese unless you just want to listen to like

835
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:59,560
Japanese talk like if you're an anime and you just like listening to sexy Japanese talking or whatever you might get a kick out of

836
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,560
This it's a good educational tool. That's true

837
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,040
Yeah, oh, man. I was gonna go in real life story. We don't have time

838
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:09,200
I was gonna talk about Telemundo and in Spanish, but that's right because I love me some tell me

839
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,720
Anyway, um

840
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:18,060
Let's change stories now check it out if you like radio and and Kojima

841
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:21,460
What's going on with Video Games Live?

842
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:25,220
That tour kind of comes and goes and comes and goes.

843
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:26,420
What is it doing now, Jamie?

844
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:27,420
Is it coming or going?

845
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:31,860
It's actually closing the Game Developers Conference in San Jose.

846
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:36,820
Basically, it's just going to be Video Games Live concert featuring performances of music

847
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,660
from various classic game titles.

848
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:45,340
It's going to be on Friday, March 24th and performed by the Symphony Silicon Valley Orchestra

849
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:51,760
and it's full chorus and so we have the pong music again it says among the games

850
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:57,120

851
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:02,000
Castlevania, Medal of Honor, Sonic, Kingdom Hearts, and Final Fantasy along

852
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:08,060

853
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:11,980
good get your tickets soon it's gonna sell out all right now we're gonna move

854
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:16,180
on to another topic this one's kind of a long topic and the chat rooms actually

855
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:19,060
been asking about this like all night long when we're gonna get to this so

856
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:24,880
here we go you guys probably heard earlier this week there was a gamer out

857
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:31,260
there who took his own life and it was he was a member of this forum well and

858
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:34,300
it which was what a Metal Gear Solid forum if I remember unfortunately here's

859
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:38,620
the thing the media kind of tied a knot of this story and I'm even looking at

860
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:44,820
this article that Kotaku ran on it that really was trying to kind of sort things out about

861
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:46,260
what the media misreported.

862
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:49,620
I think the media said it was a Bulgarian website at some point or something.

863
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:50,860
It was crazy.

864
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:56,160
And certainly, we don't want to make light of this tragic event and it's very sad that

865
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,140
somebody decided to take their own life.

866
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:05,520
But unfortunately, now it's kind of as these types of tragic events tend to make happen

867
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,960
is that activism comes out in many, many different ways.

868
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,100
There's types of activism.

869
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:14,300
There's good activism, and there's bad activism, and we're going to talk about both those types

870
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:16,160
of activism that have been going on.

871
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:21,160
So let me kind of start with this, is the article on Kotaku that they were kind of reprinting

872
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:28,160
something that was posted by, I want to say, Tim Rogers, talking about kind of the misrepresentation

873
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,160
of the AFP story.

874
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,840
I'm going to read little blips of this here.

875
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,600
I'm going to get political with you for a moment.

876
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:38,020
Our website, run by some people I respect, metalgearsolid.org, has been shut down by

877
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:44,200
a government agency following an AFP Newswire story reported on Yahoo News and CNN about

878
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:49,500
how a member of their forums broadcasted his suicide via webcam as other forum members

879
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,500
egged him on.

880
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:53,600
Apparently, it was big news for a few moments over in America.

881
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,840
The worst thing is it's not true.

882
00:54:55,840 --> 00:55:00,200
For one thing, the forum member who did in fact commit suicide did not broadcast his

883
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,200
death.

884
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:05,520
Moreover, the forum members tried with all their might to take him down.

885
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:10,180
What can you do is contact the AFP wire organization, tell them that you think this is horrible,

886
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:13,740
that they should fire the reporter responsible for these bizarrely malicious lies, and then

887
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:15,600
apologize as widely as possible.

888
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,320
If you want to read the whole thing, that was originally published over on insert credit,

889
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:21,880
but it also ran on Kotaku, which is where I first saw it.

890
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:28,280
So now we get to good activism and bad activism, and it relates to somebody that is quite the

891
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:32,900
activist in the gaming scene and everyone's I'm just turning it over to

892
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:40,760
Jamie everyone's favorite asshole sorry Jack Thompson I'm not going to mince my

893
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:45,940
words on this I'm going to say exactly how I feel and before he decides to come

894
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:55,340
after us and say these are my opinions of you I am exercising my first amendment

895
00:55:55,340 --> 00:56:03,000
right you asshole Jack Thompson is a leech he is nothing but a parasite he

896
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,420
cares nothing about the person that committed suicide he cares nothing about

897
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:09,000
the family he cares nothing about the families of the people involved in his

898
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,660
cases he's working on he is using their pain and suffering to be a leech and use

899
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:19,880
it to further his goal of notoriety and to fill his pocketbook that is all he is

900
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:23,740
after he cares nothing about those families and of course is using the

901
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:28,780
gaming community by basically publicly defaming the entire community and what

902
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:34,460
did he do to demonstrate this to you this week it had to do with the basically

903
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:40,180
the letters and posts he was doing regarding the suicide that went on

904
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:45,580
basically and on top of that I find this exactly hilarious he was trying to use

905
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:51,340
the Bible to support and he's a lawyer he should know something like that would

906
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:54,340
not hold up in court excuse me no a devil's advocate for just a minute

907
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:57,100
because I'm curious here how do we know it's really him because these are being

908
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:00,620
done through anonymous posts on the game's politics website or sorry game

909
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:05,120
politics website right how do we know it's really him could it just be somebody

910
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:10,780
trying to raise of IP hmm also every other thing that I've ever read by him

911
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:17,060
it very much fits how he writes and I've gotten good at that because I've had to

912
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:20,980
hunt down impersonators and things before so you know I heard I read on one

913
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:25,240
these sites. You linked me the other night to somebody's one-up blog that had compiled

914
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:30,720
a lot of these posts together, which I thought was pretty well done, and I think they actually

915
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:35,140
posted in there some type of letter that Jack Thompson had tried to send to the folks in

916
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:44,140
Pennsylvania against gamepolitics.com, Gamepolitics.com is one of the most intelligent websites, and

917
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:46,680
I'm not just saying this because I've talked to the guy that runs it, he's a really nice

918
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:53,260
it really is one of the most intelligent websites out there about gaming and I think is like the I

919
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,780
Think it's like definitive of how gamers can be very intelligent people

920
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:02,940
I think this website stands up for that and when I see Jack Thompson attacking that it makes me go

921
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:05,160
He's threatened by that. He's threatened by that

922
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:07,740
good

923
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:11,220
Upstanding, you know gamers doing you know smart intelligent things

924
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:17,060
he called playing video games a masturbatory activity as in senseless

925
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:20,780
self stimulation you know maybe if he had some stimulation he wouldn't be so

926
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:25,820
anal retentive that he spews shit every time he opens his mouth sorry I said I

927
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:29,660
wasn't gonna mince my words that's how exactly how I feel all right okay I'm

928
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:32,860
gonna I'm gonna be a girl now we're gonna have to explicit tag this show

929
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:38,060
that's all right usually that gets more listeners anyway yay press no but

930
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:41,420
I apologize for my... That was very Jack Thompson of you.

931
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:44,980
Just teasing. But seriously though,

932
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:48,220
and this, I get the emails on it,

933
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:51,620
I hear about it, and it's just,

934
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:55,500
I hit my saturation point. I'm like, okay, someone,

935
00:58:55,500 --> 00:59:00,100
he needs to just go away. And, you know, I'm always one that

936
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:03,140
believes if you ignore the problem, you know,

937
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:07,420
it doesn't necessarily go away. It might get worse. You know, things don't change

938
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:09,560
until you make them change, right?

939
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:12,720
Someone seriously, if he's gonna be all up in arms

940
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,460
defaming the community, I think the community

941
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:17,300
needs to take some steps to defend itself.

942
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:18,940
Well, can I share one interesting way

943
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:20,780
that the community has decided to defend itself?

944
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:21,620
Absolutely.

945
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:23,300
All right, I thought this was very interesting.

946
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:24,860
There's actually this website going on,

947
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:27,240
and it's actually a LiveJournal community,

948
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:29,180
and it's called Flowers for Jack,

949
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:30,540
and you can access this website.

950
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:34,860
It's flowersforjack.livejournal.com, okay?

951
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:40,000
They've just updated, actually as of the time we're recording this, they've just reached

952
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
the $70 mark.

953
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,220
What are they doing here?

954
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:48,340
They are trying to raise money to buy flowers for Jack Thompson.

955
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:51,200
Now why the hell would you want to buy flowers for Jack Thompson?

956
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,200
This is why.

957
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:57,720
I quote from this article, my point is simple, gamers everywhere write him hate mail, send

958
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:00,100
him threats, call him at all hours of the night.

959
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:02,260
This is not constructive.

960
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:04,740
This only makes us into what he says we are.

961
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:09,280
We are to the point that he will disregard any correspondence at the very least, threaten

962
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,800
it legally at the most.

963
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:15,080
It's hard to get his attention for real, I propose we write him a stern, dignified letter

964
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:19,520
free of insults, exaggerations, or unfounded complaints and state the most honest and reasonable

965
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:20,840
case we can.

966
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:24,560
Most importantly, it will be sent with as many bouquets of beautiful pink roses as I

967
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:26,880
can possibly send to his office.

968
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:27,880
Love it.

969
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:28,880
Love it.

970
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:29,880
You should totally do that.

971
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,160
We're gonna, we're gonna send $20 on behalf of Orange Lounge Radio.

972
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,160
We are contributing to this.

973
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:34,160
We are gonna contribute to the flowers for Jack Conroy.

974
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,760
He's going to call it an act of terrorism.

975
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:39,320
Flowers, an act of terrorism, come on.

976
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:40,320
Come on.

977
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:46,480
And for all those people that I'm reading that say, you know, kill him, do that, no.

978
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,480
That's not constructive.

979
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,120
That's exactly what these guys are saying you should not do.

980
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:53,840
But my other point to that, to maybe convince people that that's not the best course of

981
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:54,840
action?

982
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:55,840
Martyr.

983
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:58,520
Remember what happened to our last major martyr, right?

984
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:01,520
We now have rampant Christianity everywhere.

985
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:11,680
Now listen, this is the same guy who considered a donation in his name of $10,000 as a defamation

986
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:12,680
of character.

987
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:15,760
I mean, it's pretty retarded.

988
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:19,680
I did also find it funny that one of the things I read, you know how he's bringing out that

989
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:24,000
had this person known the love of Jesus Christ, they wouldn't have done that.

990
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:30,800
He was basically shot down by a minister, by a Protestant pastor.

991
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:37,680
This kind of brings me to another point and I get really nervous when we get into the

992
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:43,420
religious talk on the show and I'm not a very religious person myself but there are certain

993
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:46,200
types of religious people I have a lot of respect for.

994
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:50,020
I have a really, really good friend of mine at work who is a deeply religious person but

995
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:54,860
I value him totally as a friend and I really respect him and his beliefs and stuff because

996
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:58,240
they are his beliefs and I think that's great.

997
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:03,340
I love it when I see these really intelligent Christian rebuttals, and there's one of them

998
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:08,280
that actually was posted to Game Politics, the same thing here, they actually got a letter

999
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:12,740
from one of their readers, David Savage, and I thought it was great.

1000
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:15,580
I don't know how much of this I really want to read, you should just go read it for yourself

1001
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:17,580
over on GamePolitics.com.

1002
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:21,780
I am a Christian, non-denominational, yet I am also the first person to admit that enforcing

1003
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:25,820
religious opinion as a way of censorship in video games is asinine.

1004
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:29,340
face facts video games are fiction just like books movies and television however

1005
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:33,300
it seems as if pundits lawyers and media mongers have been using my religion as a

1006
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:37,900
meat shield for their ignorant attacks on video games very interesting and it

1007
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:41,780
kind of goes on to these things I'm not going to read the whole thing is

1008
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:44,940
running a long time but just go check it out for yourself game politics calm very

1009
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:51,180
very well written loved it Wow anything else we want to say on this I'm not

1010
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:55,020
going to be running for president anytime soon chat room sorry lots of

1011
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:57,320
heated response from the chat room there.

1012
01:02:57,320 --> 01:03:01,240
I'm sure they're just dying to get in on the Skyline, which we'll do after the break in

1013
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:02,280
a little bit.

1014
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:06,740
Somebody saying here, an interesting comment from Wonder Dog Harold, I'd rather send money

1015
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:10,420
to a charity rather than flowers for Jack Thompson.

1016
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:11,740
That is a good point.

1017
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:15,880
That is a very good point, and we do also donate to charity once in a while, too.

1018
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:20,980
We did the big Sacramento Independent Audio for Katrina Relief thing a while ago, which

1019
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:22,940
was a good success.

1020
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:28,160
So we do that stuff too, but we support causes that we want to back, and this is definitely

1021
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:33,340
one of those causes that we think ought to deserve a little support and a little airtime

1022
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:34,340
and a little money.

1023
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:35,340
Just a little money.

1024
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:36,340
We're not sending them a lot.

1025
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:37,340
Twenty bucks isn't a lot.

1026
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:38,340
So, anyway.

1027
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:42,800
Anything else you want to say on that?

1028
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:43,800
We good?

1029
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:44,800
Loki, you're awfully quiet.

1030
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:45,800
All things considered.

1031
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:46,800
Doug Tate.

1032
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:51,880
Jack, he had that thing that came out last weekend about wanting to recall all these

1033
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:56,060
games that are coming out in 25 to life and all these violent murder simulators

1034
01:03:56,060 --> 01:04:01,000
as he said he's right you know we do have too many murder simulators out

1035
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,620
there why we need more sex simulators that's what I'm hoping for

1036
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:11,500
rockstar if you're listening get on it hot coffee the game all right we got one

1037
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:14,940
more segment to do before we go to break here and it just seemed like I don't

1038
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:17,800
know why but it seemed like an inappropriate time to get into this

1039
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:23,960
segment, maybe it's just me, but it's time to bring on the anger in the FUs of the week.

1040
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:39,080
Dark soccer, what's ticking you off this week? Well, I think I actually just ranted myself out

1041
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:46,760
on the biggest thing that was pissing me off this week, so instead of going off on ye olde

1042
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:50,520
butt head again. I'm going to have to say that my biggest

1043
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:55,240
nephew of the week goes toward um waiting to the last

1044
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:59,320
minute to get things done. In this case I blame myself because I

1045
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:02,760
waited to the last minute to check my tire so now I have a flat.

1046
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:09,320
Oops! But it's- I see so many- I have to deal with this so often in my

1047
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:14,120
daily work. People going oh I didn't do it or oh I

1048
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:18,520
I forgot or this it goes back to this thing called personal responsibility, right?

1049
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:27,500
It's personal responsibility. I think people not accounting for it not having it is what is contributing to the downfall of this country

1050
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:32,320
You see it in little things every day. You see it on a wide scale like with our

1051
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:39,700
Not so good friend. Mr. Thompson who is playing games instead of individual people for their own actions, right?

1052
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:45,700
we see it ourselves with oh well I can just do this later or with oh but I was

1053
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:52,020
busy doing this if people said you know I admit I was wrong let me maybe let me

1054
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:57,340
do this if people would just stop and admit hey you need to do this or I

1055
01:05:57,340 --> 01:06:03,380
didn't do it or here it's done right on time I think that would all be better

1056
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:09,260
off it's a sign of responsibility you know the moment you admit that you broke

1057
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:13,340
the glasses the day you're supposed to be an adult right instead of blaming the dog

1058
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:23,260
all right loki my f-u of the week is going to mcdonald's mainly though it's not mcdonald's

1059
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:28,780
fault i'm blaming vegetarians and fat people for making mcdonald's food taste like crap

1060
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:33,420
here's the reason why before the vegetarians attacked mcdonald's for adding their meat

1061
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:38,060
flavoring to their fries their fries kick ass then they came in fries tastes

1062
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:42,820
like crap now and they can't freaking cook them for damn the other thing is

1063
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:47,500
also they've tried to make these more healthy choices on their menus no need

1064
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:51,820
the food was good before you had to go and fuck with it listen if you don't

1065
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:56,380
want to eat that crap don't attack my food god damn it I love supersize I love

1066
01:06:56,380 --> 01:06:59,780
the amount of soda that I got there in the amount of fries I was happy with

1067
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:33,860
log on there at like 10.01 and all the good seats are gone. Oh, because all the good seats

1068
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:38,820
go to contest winners and, and, and, uh, you know, industry people and people that don't

1069
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:42,300
deserve to be in the front row. I deserve to be in the front row. Horrible. So I don't

1070
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:48,780
like the way ticketing is done, so F you to that.

1071
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:54,260
Which, none of those really had a lot to do with games. Good job. Alright. That's alright.

1072
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:57,660
Anyway, we are now going to take this opportunity. Oh no, one more thing. One more thing. Oh,

1073
01:07:57,660 --> 01:07:58,660
How can I forget this?

1074
01:07:58,660 --> 01:07:59,780
This is very important.

1075
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:05,380
A new segment, a brand new segment we've got to do, and this is great too.

1076
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:06,840
I love this segment.

1077
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:08,900
You know what time it is?

1078
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:12,740
No, it's not Dark Sakura's advice column.

1079
01:08:12,740 --> 01:08:18,200
Sorry, that is still gone, but Dark Sakura, instead of scouring the world for good advice

1080
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:23,500
to bring you, she is scouring the internet for websites that need your immediate attention.

1081
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:27,180
So we're now bringing you Dark Sakura's Website of the Week.

1082
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:34,180
Today's website is stuffomycat.com. It is the most adorable site in existence.

1083
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:40,180
In fact, today's little bit of love on this features a picture of a cat fighting Godzilla.

1084
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:48,180
It's adorable. But basically, the whole premise of this site is people actually just putting things on the cat, sending a picture.

1085
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:52,180
Now, please don't hurt your cat if you're going to do this, because that's animal cruelty and that's not cool.

1086
01:08:52,180 --> 01:08:56,180
Some of these cats just look anywhere from amused to vaguely annoyed.

1087
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:57,680
Some of them are game related though, right?

1088
01:08:57,680 --> 01:09:01,180
Oh yeah, well, this one has wrestling figures sitting on the cat.

1089
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:05,180
And there was another one, this one has an Xbox 360 laying on a cat.

1090
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:07,180
The cat just looks irritated.

1091
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:10,680
Another one has cats wearing clothing, cats with DVDs on them,

1092
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:15,180
cats with alien facehuggers, stuffed alien facehuggers on them.

1093
01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:19,180
And there were also different, you know, anime stuff.

1094
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:22,180
This one has a bunch of trash on the cat, and some of them have cats with ear.

1095
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:25,180
Now, some people have said that StuffOnMyCat.com,

1096
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:28,460
I know we're gonna get this feedback has already been featured in a lot of different places

1097
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:29,500
I'm gonna be honest with you

1098
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:36,260
I did not hear about stuff on my cap calm until this week when get this on the exact same day the exact same day

1099
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:41,260
One of my co-workers and Jamie both pointed this side out to me in the same day

1100
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:45,260
I thought that was really weird like how word travels like that. So it was new to me

1101
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:48,220
I randomly check stuff on my cat quite often

1102
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:56,100
You know, there's one with naked Barbies on it another one just with a giant bag on it. I think it's adorable

1103
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:58,540
I love stuff on my cat calm my feet

1104
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:03,260
Know that's wrong. I was gonna say my favorite is the one where I saw and you know

1105
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:08,780
Someone's SUV back rear tire on top of a cab, but you know, hey

1106
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:14,140
All right. I think though that we should there should be my cat on stuff calm. I

1107
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:20,300
I looked for them, no one did it yet. I found the picture with the

1108
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:23,860
cat covered in Game Boys, so I'm linking that to the chat room.

1109
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:28,140
That's why my co-workers showed me. You know what this all is. This is just the US version of Oolong.

1110
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:31,220
In a way. You know Oolong's on Wikipedia now.

1111
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:34,660
Yes, I linked that to you too. And so is you being, but

1112
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:38,020
Oolong's dead. And we're on Wikipedia, Orange Long Radio. That's like,

1113
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:41,940
that's when some of my friends told me, dude, Rob, you guys really are famous.

1114
01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:43,020
You're on Wikipedia.

1115
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:43,860
I'm like, come on.

1116
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:46,300
We do this show out of the spare bedroom in my apartment.

1117
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:48,100
We're not famous yet, but we are on Wikipedia,

1118
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:49,980
which is all kinds of cool, so.

1119
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:52,980
We're internet celebrities, yo.

1120
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:54,520
Take that however you want.

1121
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:55,620
All right, we're gonna go to a break.

1122
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:56,840
When we come back from the break,

1123
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:01,840
Loki's gonna bring us a whole buttload of Xbox 360 stuff,

1124
01:11:02,620 --> 01:11:06,940
and we're gonna do the worst-reviewed games of all time

1125
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:09,700
and lots of stuff coming up after the break.

1126
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:12,620
