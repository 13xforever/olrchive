289	5211	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to the podcast stream twice weekly.
5471	13215	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
13715	16996	And now, the conclusion of episode 170 for January 15, 2006.
19571	21913	I thought we were talking about Oregon Trail the MMO
45583	46544	Dance Dance Revolution Supernova
63082	65403	It was announced on DDRFreak.com this week.
65823	71186	Betson Enterprises is distributing it, although it's assumed that Konami is actually making the game.
71446	79690	We don't know a lot outside of that, except for a logo that was also posted on DDRFreak in the forums, a little red and black looking logo.
80070	81150	Should be very interesting.
81170	90775	I should also point out, most of the previous arcade versions of DDR that you've played were actually quote-unquote illegal machines from Japan.
91680	94761	And DDR shouldn't be confused with the other arcade dancing game in the groove.
94841	95842	That's a whole other story.
97322	103585	But we haven't had a US release in the arcades of a DDR game since DDR USA Mix, which was like...
104520	105060	I want to say 98, 99?
106281	107883	It was a long time ago.
108223	109984	So this one is being made in the U.S.
110064	116490	It's not being made for Japanese release, or we don't really know the full specifics on that, but we do know it's definitely coming out for USA.
116950	117591	What do you guys think?
117691	124496	As longtime DDR fans, because I know y'all are, because Orange Sons Radio started as kind of a music game station, what do you think?
124816	126398	Loki, is this something you're excited about?
126778	131342	It took them a long time to start over, I guess, but it should be interesting.
131762	133103	Might get me back in the plane again.
133766	135787	I just have to see how it is, because it could suck.
136968	137889	That's the whole thing.
138009	144432	It's gotta be, they've got a second chance to do something right, and they better not screw it up.
145433	146013	DarkSakura?
146654	151697	My sentiments, exactly, except I've just been sort of like, oh, DDR.
152697	155819	Is it too late to save you, to bring you back into the DDR loop?
155839	161823	Well, no, when it's out, I'll be excited, but right now, because I don't know anything about it, and I just like,
163590	165056	I'm hoping it's not too little too late.
165117	168953	It's got to be something impressive for me to be really excited about it, honestly.
170623	172984	I'm having good feelings about this.
173044	174125	I think they're going to do a good job.
174145	176345	The home mixes recently have been pretty good.
176665	181067	There's been lots of improvements, but I think Konami's kind of in tune with their fan base to an extent.
181687	182948	It depends which game we're talking about.
184028	185069	But I'm hopeful.
185149	187950	I'm hopeful that they'll come out with a large catalog of stuff.
188010	192311	I'm assuming they're going to port stuff over from the home mixes and mix it with some new stuff.
192331	193652	So I think it'll be a fun arcade thing.
194192	196733	I'm just looking forward to getting back and going to the arcading groups.
198193	201395	The one thing I'm really hoping to get out of this is more diversity in the music.
202655	203136	That would be cool.
203416	206617	More diversity, not just the same... Oh, it's Danzy.
206817	209498	But I think the US mixes have done it, especially like Ultra Mix 3.
209538	212680	Oh yeah, that's a step in the right direction.
213500	216281	I think so, but... I don't know.
217362	218542	And this is just how I am anyway.
218602	220403	I try to reserve judgment until I actually see it.
220683	220843	Right.
221864	222124	All right.
222526	223846	Make Latav's here, by the way.
223906	224867	I know he hasn't said anything yet.
224907	226347	Probably because he can't, because he's afraid.
226567	229448	He actually works at Konami, but obviously can't say a word about this.
230568	231349	Or can you?
231589	236390	No, not really, but I can say that it sounds pretty awesome from the stuff I do know.
236650	238671	So, thumbs up.
239331	239951	Look out for it.
240231	241752	And you know what the best part is, though?
241872	242052	What?
242412	247233	That it's being distributed by Betsyn, so that means Dave and Busters can get it.
247754	252175	So, you've got Pump Zero coming out really soon, and then
253163	256786	Such and such time for Supernova, and when they're both there, you know what that means?
257446	259267	No lines on Pump Zero for me.
259728	262810	Is that a conflict of interest, the fact that you like Pump It Up so much yet?
263090	270415	No, everybody knows I like Pump It Up more than life, so... Alright, Pump It Up, of course, for those that don't know, is the Korean...
270836	272857	Dance Game Dance Game Dance Game Dance Game Dance Game
295620	299725	Yay, New York!
300145	301507	We wave our little flag.
310165	312927	We are opening up the Skype line for the first time on our podcast.
313368	320194	You can either go to OrangeLoungeRadio.com and click on Interact With Us, or you can actually give us a call as well, 916-226-9067.
321495	325239	But please be aware that could be a toll call depending on where you're at.
325279	327180	So ask Mommy and Daddy before you do that.
327561	329102	All right, let's go to the phones.
329162	330663	Who's going to be our very first caller?
330804	331404	I don't know.
332185	333226	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
333986	334467	Are you there?
335288	335528	Yes.
335948	336609	Yes, who is this?
337700	338400	Xander from Florida.
338680	339741	Hi, Xander from Florida.
339761	340401	What's on your mind?
340641	343062	Am I the first call?
343142	344503	He's breaking up a little bit there.
345163	345963	Am I the first call?
346303	348564	Yes, you are the first call, but you're breaking up pretty bad there.
348584	349164	What's on your mind?
351965	353986	Gosh, I'm sorry about the breaking up thing.
354026	354386	That's all right.
354806	355607	Breaking up is hard to do.
358648	360468	Yeah, I wanted to talk about the DDR thing, of course.
360808	361089	All right.
361149	362369	What's on your mind about the DDR thing?
365385	365965	Here's what I think.
367366	373068	If it's going to work, in some way they're going to have to cater to the Indie Groove audience.
373548	383311	Like it or not, there are going to be a lot of very upset people if Indie Groove dies and this game doesn't have at least 11s, if not 12s.
385279	396422	So, as an In The Groove fan, which I know in previous calls to this show you've said that you are, what are you looking for Konami to do to please the In The Groove fanbase?
396462	400343	Are you saying more difficult 11s and 12s or what?
401503	407425	More 9s and more 10s and maybe add 11s, possibly 12s, but I don't think they'd do that.
407585	408945	I mean, I'd be kind of shocked if they had 12s.
410306	412927	So is it just a difficulty thing for you or is there more to it?
414127	414507	It's mostly...
418259	430425	I don't see why Konami has to cater to the In The Groove audience They left them, they abandoned them We don't want them back!
433874	442297	Like, you know, go play your game that has music that sounds the same through every song and that has steps that are ridiculously hard.
442657	445297	If that's what you find fun, go play in the groove.
445738	451479	If you want music that sounds pretty decent and, you know, might not be super hard for you, go play DDR.
451699	455721	Listen, I'm going to come back here, shockingly, on the middle ground here.
456261	458541	Now... Shh!
458922	459402	Quiet!
459862	460122	Anyways...
461015	466058	What I was basically going to say is Konami, what they want to do with especially a lot of these music games, they want to cater to everybody, obviously.
466438	469359	So that means not too easy, not too hard type of stuff.
469959	472261	Remember, folks, there's always edit steps.
472401	475822	You always have your edits that you can put on the machines or you can make yourself.
476162	478343	That could be any size difficulty.
478363	479724	Yeah, but how many people actually do that?
480504	480885	Not enough.
481425	488028	I used to when we had a fourth mix because God knows some of those songs were just craptastic.
488048	488128	Yeah.
488855	491096	Remember the old Hell edits?
491776	492756	Yeah, those ones are fun.
492956	494236	I made it all jump rock beat.
494356	495356	That was so much fun.
495616	497657	I don't know that I knew you then.
497817	503558	I used to make these insanely hard edits and then would challenge people and if they could beat them with a decent score, I'd buy them dinner.
503998	504798	Oh, that's pretty cool.
504958	509679	Alright, I want to keep it moving tonight with the calls, but I definitely want to give Xander a chance to say his piece.
509699	510119	So, Xander?
511340	517641	Well, okay, I think they do need to cater to the group because
518783	522025	I don't know, there's just going to be a lot of very angry people.
522426	524247	They killed Groove with the stupid lawnmower.
525208	532513	I mean, it really, if they're going to have a monopoly on the dance games, then they need to cater to everybody.
533014	537337	Not just a misdemeanor that can't get on one-footers.
537827	539328	They are catering to everybody.
539768	540809	All difficulty levels.
562621	578745	from coming out, which is what is assumably intended with this lawsuit, then shouldn't they, if they're going to stomp out in the groove, so to speak, and no pun intended, shouldn't they put elements that make in the groove so loved in their game?
578865	580446	That's what I'm hearing here.
580706	584047	Elements are in the groove, so they've got to steal someone else's intellectual copy.
584067	584527	Oh, stop it.
584747	585027	Stop it.
585067	585347	All right.
585727	588308	Xander, I want to give you a chance, though, for final words here.
588328	589368	Okay.
590011	590451	That's about it.
591032	591352	All right.
591692	592492	Thanks for your call, Sandra.
592512	592972	Appreciate it.
592992	597695	It's actually one thing that did occur to me, though, that would completely eliminate this whole 10-11 crap.
598815	600716	Start grading it like they do Guitar Freaks.
601837	604238	With the numbers going up to 100 and stuff like that?
604278	604438	Yeah.
604698	605939	That would be pretty cool, actually.
605959	609921	So that you have more of a broad scale to judge the difficulty by.
610101	616384	But then it brings up the point, like with Neon FM, when it was coming out, you've got a 55 and a 56.
616504	618025	What's the difference between those two numbers?
619059	621060	Maybe you have like a trill somewhere in the middle of the song.
621340	624882	That would be interesting though if Konami said, you know what, screw this whole 10, 11, 12 business.
624922	628484	We'll just do a whole new rating system and F this thing.
628644	629865	I guess we'll see pretty soon.
629885	633127	They did try that once with the gauges, but the gauges were retarded.
634067	637369	I think this whole scale needs to be implemented.
637469	639551	Hi, this is Tony from Washington I wanted to give my opinion of a new DS game
667188	668168	Oh, sure, what's up?
668188	673309	It's called Trace Memory in the US or another code in the UK.
673709	674369	It's a great game.
676030	677870	What do you think about Trace Memory?
679150	680551	It is interesting.
681691	683391	What is the point of Trace Memory?
683411	686312	Because I haven't really played this game a whole lot, so what exactly do you do in Trace Memory?
687172	693213	Basically, you're this girl who, on the day before her 14th birthday, finds out that her
694758	696840	Finds out that her dad is alive.
696860	700603	Finds out that her dad is alive.
702325	705908	My friends, you're breaking up here a little bit, so it's really hard to understand you here.
705988	710172	But I'm going to throw it back to the studio and talk a little bit here about Trace Memory.
711393	713275	And I appreciate you bringing it up here.
713395	716498	So what do you guys think about Trace Memory?
717438	718039	I really played it.
718219	719921	I did a review on that one about three months ago.
720081	720281	Yeah?
720381	720821	I don't remember.
722108	729031	It was the one that had puzzle elements where you walk up through a village, up through a house, and try to put the whole thing together.
729651	731692	And I was really, really interested in it.
731772	734793	I haven't picked it up yet, just my schedule is not allowed for it.
735493	739255	But it was one that I was actually really interested in playing, and I've heard nothing but good about it.
739555	740775	I did play all the way through it.
742056	744477	The only problem with it was that it was really short.
745617	747198	I felt there was really nothing...
748908	750669	that would bring me back to it once I beat it.
751050	758916	It did have a lot of really cool things with the DS, like opening the DS partway so you could see the reflection off both screens to solve a puzzle.
759337	760177	That was cool.
760558	762359	But I don't know, it was a pretty good game.
762379	764561	I wish it was at least four hours longer, though.
765515	767356	All right, let's go ahead and go back to the Skype line.
767696	770057	Again, you can give us a call over the phone as well, 916-226-9067.
770177	775300	Or you can call us on username OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.
775900	777180	Let's go to the phones.
777320	778441	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
780262	781442	Hi, Sephiroth1215 here.
781622	782663	Hi, Sephiroth1215.
782703	783183	What's on your mind?
784304	785184	A bunch of things.
785884	787965	First of all, about the new DDR coming out.
788506	790887	I mean, I was really excited when I first heard it.
790947	791247	I mean, I...
792469	796612	How to make sure, like, alright, how close are we to April Fools?
796812	798913	Because that's happened before anyway.
799053	801975	That was the resounding reaction of DDR Freak.
802015	803676	And I'm like, come on, people.
804377	806018	They're not that cruel over there.
806298	807259	Especially about something like this.
807299	808520	This is something you don't joke about.
808940	811041	Well, we are that cruel, but we don't joke about that.
813123	816645	As we remember the big everybody is now an admin thing that went on.
817806	819347	Otherwise, I didn't
821820	822621	I'm curious about this.
822682	827530	I mean, I'm sure it's going to be a big step, but it could also be bad.
827570	828171	We never know.
828892	831877	It could be just another bad mix.
833119	833961	I'm kind of hoping.
835009	842176	Not that anyway, but... It's really hard to judge the game until we see at least like a screenshot or know something else about it.
842216	846480	So everything you hear is all assumptions at this point.
846640	847120	Everything.
847180	850383	They could change the foundation of the game for all we know.
850443	855588	Now, here's my only concern is remember the last arcade game to come out and, you know, this is
856204	863387	Not one that's really talked about a lot, but Dancing Stage Fusion in the UK, another arcade release that was supposed to be, oh, it's on brand new hardware.
863967	865747	It was just a port of the game to the arcade.
865787	867428	It was, like, crap.
868708	870389	This will not be the case for this game.
870489	876811	From what I know, which, you know, I can't say what I do know, but you shouldn't worry that much at this point.
877711	878572	Alright, fair enough.
879012	880913	Alright, anything else you want to share with us, Sibroth?
881713	884874	Oh, yeah, this... I mean, obviously there's going to be a lot of
885695	893918	Um, controversy, or maybe a little war in the group now in DDR, but whatever, I don't really care.
894279	912246	I mean, I'm still going to play both of them, but I've been wondering about the memory card slots or whatever they're going to do for that, because I'm thinking, like, if they use PS2 memory cards, then they have to license to use them, or to use Magic Gate, so I'm not sure about that.
912648	913789	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
913869	914069	Oh my god.
941488	943409	Oh my god, oh my god, who's this?
944990	946470	This is Tomo-kun.
947311	948451	Oh hey, it's my fanboy.
948691	950292	What's up Tomo-kun, what's on your mind?
951513	952913	Wait, I don't believe this.
954234	959937	I was actually just going to say something about that Xbox 360 thing and the DirecTV thing.
960497	966040	Yeah, you actually messaged me something in the chatroom about the whole DirecTV Xbox 360 thing.
966400	967080	What's going on with this?
968201	970662	I think it's a joke, personally, because...
971317	974600	This is not just Xbox 360.
974800	978643	They're going to make it a Windows Media Extender.
981425	988610	And also, what I don't like is that during this, they dropped the TiVo line.
989511	997357	So everyone, including me, and I have one of these, has to have the R15, which is also just a piece of crap.
999212	999552	Hmm.
999572	1000432	Very interesting point.
1000452	1001193	You're right there.
1001893	1005674	How far is Microsoft going to go to support the whole Mac thing?
1005714	1006375	But, okay, interesting.
1006395	1006695	Well, I... What?
1006715	1006795	What?
1025549	1028273	Yeah, and it's a game console.
1028293	1030657	It doesn't have to be your whole media center.
1032240	1037167	It really sounds like we're slipping into the realm of video game corporate politics.
1037869	1039231	You know, more of another...
1040510	1044451	tool to put one under the other, you know, is what it sounds like to me.
1044932	1054455	Well, and it's interesting because Tomokun's saying, you know, why not just stick with the games, what you know, and why get into all this other stuff, you know, with the media center.
1054475	1066760	But I think that's kind of where the next generation of gaming is really going, especially as, you know, games get more and more realistic and the internet, it's becoming, you know, one big centerpiece in your living room, so to speak.
1066960	1067880	I do have to say that
1068520	1078285	Dan sits for like an hour pulling my MP3s off my computer through the Xbox just listening to stuff in the living room when I'm in the other room.
1078765	1083307	All I can say is thank goodness for Nintendo keeping us with just games and not all this extra crap.
1083587	1083887	Amen.
1084468	1084788	So far.
1085788	1086809	Alright, Tomokuni.
1087029	1087329	Oh, yeah?
1088570	1088770	What?
1089630	1091171	I was going to say, anything else you want to share with us?
1092972	1093572	Yeah, I just...
1094136	1105464	I was going to say, I don't think that's going to be executed well enough because if anyone's used one of the new boxes, like me, it's horrible to use.
1105804	1107686	It'll probably kill your Xbox.
1108646	1109467	Well, we'll see.
1109667	1110107	We'll see.
1110268	1110528	All right.
1110548	1111969	Well, thanks so much for calling in, Tomokun.
1111989	1112509	Appreciate it.
1113610	1113850	Thanks.
1114130	1114551	Have a good one.
1115491	1118173	And with some of those Xboxes, you can sneeze on them and it'll kill them.
1118613	1120235	Yeah, it's kind of a... B.S.O.D.
1120275	1120595	All right.
1121576	1122016	All right.
1122742	1123702	Well, thank you guys for calling in.
1123722	1127523	We'll open up the Skype line a little later if we have some more time, but I don't know because we're kind of running over tonight.
1127543	1127863	We'll see.
1128503	1130844	For now, though, let's talk about Xbox 360.
1130964	1135945	Loki, one of the surprise hits of Xbox 360 is not something that's on store shelves.
1136365	1137325	It's Geometry Wars.
1137525	1147667	Yep, Geometry Wars Retro Evolved has actually been downloaded at least the trial's been downloaded over 200,000 times and they've sold 45,000 copies of the game, which is
1151465	1151945	and many more.
1175088	1179310	Somebody asked me not that long ago, why is it that you're so desperate to get your hands on an Xbox 360?
1179350	1184573	I'm like, Geometry Wars and Smash TV co-op?
1187074	1187734	It's cool!
1189235	1190735	It's really a good thing that they're doing.
1190755	1191896	A lot more stuff.
1191936	1201060	I know that one of the other titles that they're talking about coming to Xbox Live's arcade is like Worms, the classic Worms, and they're going to have Street Fighter 2, of course.
1201720	1202901	So lots of stuff coming to it.
1204083	1213231	I don't like that, but still, it's a really good concept that they have there, and I think you're going to see a lot of people trying to copy it.
1214572	1214832	All right.
1216828	1224230	Now, we always invite your feedback, and so that means we can open up the Skype line sometimes, or sometimes we're watching our chatroom at orangelaunchradio.com.
1224590	1225991	Sometimes we're reading the mail.
1226071	1230372	It's a great way for those of you guys that are listening to our podcast form of the show to interact with us.
1230432	1234413	Now, just a footnote, we are going to be changing the email address this week.
1235073	1238574	Even if you're still using ToGo, we'll put a forwarder in so it still works.
1238594	1244556	But since the Orange Launch Radio ToGo edition doesn't really exist anymore, the new email address will be mailbag.com.
1244896	1245977	at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
1245997	1248940	So if you want to send us an email, it's mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
1249460	1251002	But it still all works the same.
1251062	1255065	DarkSakura gets her hand in there, digs in deep, and pulls out the mail.
1256326	1258048	So DarkSakura, what's in the mailbag?
1258068	1259849	You make that sound so dirty.
1259869	1262291	Oh my.
1262492	1263913	I have to make sure people are paying attention.
1264688	1272650	Well, just to go ahead and make a quick disclaimer, by the way, the email that we receive has now tripled in the past two weeks on average.
1273230	1277111	So I apologize if I don't get to read everybody's email that is sent to me.
1277711	1281812	I do read it, and I try to reply to as many of them as possible.
1281912	1284733	I try to get in there and read it too, but I honestly don't always.
1285093	1292875	If somebody has something they have to share with me, you can find my email address on the site, but filter through Jamie because that's her thing.
1293416	1295177	Well, this one comes from Chupa Thingy.
1296717	1297897	I'm sorry, I still love that.
1297917	1299058	Is that like those old lollipops?
1299098	1299518	Chupa Chupa?
1299538	1300278	Wait a minute.
1300358	1301318	Red versus blue.
1301358	1301979	That's right.
1302039	1303759	I had this exact same conversation two weeks ago.
1303779	1304459	We'll call it Chupa Thingy.
1304479	1304920	All right.
1305200	1305520	What's up?
1305860	1306180	Puma.
1308461	1316803	But I got a response email where he's thanking us for saying that he is absolutely awesome and cool for having my little pony killer.
1318064	1318464	Oh, okay.
1318504	1319184	Now that I remember.
1319204	1319404	Yeah.
1320716	1326498	Basically, just to give this to one server, he says, Firstly, let me say that I don't understand why the IRA cares about transactions and MMOs.
1326938	1329338	It would be just like taxing PlayMoney transactions.
1329779	1332279	I guess it would be like taxing Monopoly money.
1332299	1333360	Yeah, I bought BoardWalk.
1333400	1334840	I better send George $20.
1335680	1337221	Here's one paper dollar.
1338981	1341182	Sure, the PlayMoney has market value, but who cares?
1341882	1343642	Secondly, about the external Xbox 360 HDDVDVDV.
1346883	1347183	Drive.
1349124	1355208	Maybe we will be seeing some third-party peripherals like that so the crappy Microsoft versions would not be able to dominate the market.
1355728	1357109	Can you say third-party hard drives?
1357889	1362231	Also, let me say that I am the first person in all the state of Montana to pre-order the Snoopy game.
1363772	1364192	Rock!
1365273	1366574	You are hardcore, my friend.
1368015	1370536	Sadly, I will probably not be the last as well.
1371255	1377460	With the release of Street Fighter 2 over the Xbox Live Marketplace, do you think that this will be the start of classic Capcom re-releases?
1378560	1381923	Personally, I would love to play high-def versions of 8-bit Mega Man games on my 360.
1382883	1386226	Lastly, what is the deal with the name of the Bandai Namco merged company?
1386646	1390989	I would have expected something more along the lines of Banco or Namdai or some original name.
1391450	1392270	I like Banco.
1393171	1393671	Banco.
1394332	1395032	Banco!
1395052	1395873	I kind of like Namdai.
1395893	1396633	You cannot handle the Banco.
1396653	1397074	Banco.
1398243	1399184	I kind of like Namdai.
1400305	1403027	That is a very, though, I have to say, Japanese-y thing to do.
1404168	1408912	The combination and shortening and... We need to bring back the poll on our website.
1408952	1410854	What's better, Banco or Namdai?
1411875	1412195	We'll see.
1412255	1412515	Anyway.
1412976	1417600	Well, we also have one of our... I don't think I've received an email from this person before.
1417620	1425887	Somebody, Matthew, has asked if we could talk about fear for the PC and are there any upcoming sequels or is it coming to any console platforms?
1426894	1428075	I'm going to be honest with you, Matthew.
1429056	1431557	We're human and we work day jobs as well as doing this show.
1431597	1435380	So because of that, we don't have time to play every single game that comes out.
1435720	1438142	So unfortunately, I've never touched the game Fear.
1438242	1438923	I've heard about it.
1439083	1439763	It looks neat.
1440244	1441384	I just can't afford it.
1441765	1443646	And amongst all my other gaming obsessions.
1443746	1446108	Loki, you look like you know something about this show.
1446548	1449971	I know of Fear and I know it's a really kick-ass first-person shooter.
1449991	1450991	I haven't played it.
1451031	1453393	The only real interaction with Fear that I've had is
1453945	1459690	watching Panics from Rooster Teeth, which, you know, known for Red vs. Blue.
1459710	1461711	I still laugh about that.
1461831	1464413	So definitely check that out because that's hilarious.
1465775	1474662	But yeah, I think it is coming to the 360, probably something that's either going to be late this year or next year, but it's definitely a game that's going to be ported over at some point.
1474682	1476243	All right.
1476593	1482138	Macman also points out that Apple says they're working with a new company later to be revealed.
1482819	1488905	His theory is that Apple and Nintendo are working together on the revolution because they've both released cube-shaped systems.
1491387	1495010	It's a crazy theory and obviously not the right reason.
1496492	1498794	But don't put anything past those guys.
1499495	1501777	If any company is going to be sneaking behind your back...
1502614	1503234	It's those two.
1503575	1504675	Well, there is a mention in here.
1504775	1510519	Apple said they're making a move toward the gaming market and the iMac Mini G6 hooks up to your TV.
1513040	1513640	Interesting.
1513740	1514601	Well, you never know.
1515401	1516122	Dot, dot, dot.
1516742	1517583	Anything else in the mailbag?
1518983	1526628	Actually, one of our listeners, Mike, wants to know about where we import from.
1527984	1531989	Well, just send him a few of my favorites, but more he's asking, are mod chips hard to install?
1532169	1533111	More like for GameCube.
1534092	1536014	You don't need to put a mod chip in your GameCube at all.
1536275	1538097	There's a disc you can get to swap them out.
1539479	1544646	I actually have a legitimate Japanese PlayStation 2 because I didn't want to risk mod chips, you know, back when it was early, so...
1545271	1549694	I hear they're okay now, but I just didn't want to risk it, so I have an authentic Japanese PlayStation 2.
1550014	1555097	But I actually did email him back some sites, and if anyone wants to talk to me in the chat room, I'll mention some, just not on the air.
1555877	1556778	No free advertising.
1556818	1557578	No free advertising.
1558439	1561741	However, I'm sure that any number of those sites will ship to Canada.
1562381	1562721	Oh, yeah.
1562981	1563182	Sure.
1563222	1563882	Business is business.
1564423	1565104	Hooray, new emailers!
1586050	1588132	He's actually, though, I think on our forums, too.
1588152	1588692	Okay.
1589073	1591154	But he wants to say how much he enjoys the podcast.
1591194	1591494	Thank you.
1591915	1593356	And that we do a great show.
1593376	1600380	He's wondering, since we're changing our format, if the live show will be able to be, if you can listen live through the PSP.
1602102	1605245	I'm not so sure that it's got the... It doesn't have the capability for that.
1606125	1607767	No, but anything's possible.
1607867	1611530	All it would have to be able to do is... Basically, essentially how... Streaming audio.
1611690	1613292	Yeah, streaming audio, how Winamp does it.
1613312	1614152	Because you can listen... Nope.
1615293	1619837	We use Live365 to do our live stream, and you can load that in Winamp.
1619897	1623100	So if Winamp is ported to PSP, it could happen.
1623120	1624742	But, Loki, you're saying don't count on it.
1625022	1625402	Why is that?
1625823	1626163	It's just...
1626901	1627521	They won't do it.
1628842	1634104	The only way that would be feasible to do that is when there's a new firmware that supports Flash.
1634144	1639346	And then you could do a Flash player for Live 365, because I know that exists.
1639526	1645028	I've tried to come up with a way to do it, but no, you're not going to be able to do it with just JavaScript.
1645088	1649310	So unfortunately, no, the only way you're going to be able to do it is the podcast for now.
1649350	1649830	Wait and download, yep.
1650090	1650190	Yeah.
1650972	1656296	The last bit of this email is also the podcast week of 1906 to 1506.
1657196	1662240	You said they, I forgot who, is bringing a Sega Genesis game, Beggar Prince, to America.
1662720	1664081	I honestly don't see why they are doing that.
1664101	1665242	It just seems like a waste of money.
1665302	1667403	Not that many people have their Genesis anymore.
1668944	1675188	I'll give one of our other podcast buddies a plug here because he actually has somebody from that team who's putting out that game tonight.
1675228	1680432	Check out Bobby Blackwolf this week, allgames.com slash podcast because they're actually interviewing.
1681047	1682988	One of the people that is behind that game.
1683369	1687912	So check it out, and I will be, because I'm curious about that same thing.
1688252	1689853	How are they going to get 42 bucks?
1690173	1691875	Those of us who have a Nomad will be happy.
1692155	1701541	And if you don't have a Genesis, you know, if you still have a Dreamcast, there's always Under Defeat, which is another game that was actually being brought up for the Dreamcast relatively soon.
1702622	1704403	Let's not give up on those old systems.
1704423	1705584	They're still making 2600 games.
1705604	1706224	This is true.
1707165	1707785	This is true.
1709725	1719076	Alright, so we're going to go ahead and close up the old mailbag here, but DarkSakura, you're not quite finished with us just yet, because you have a story about Dragon Quest and the Revolution?
1719336	1720177	Woohoo!
1720278	1720718	Kinda?
1721179	1721919	Sort of?
1721939	1722200	Maybe?
1722460	1724723	Well, um, Hori Yuji, who was the, uh,
1725363	1744973	The project lead and the series producer for Dragon Quest VIII, he was actually at a launch event in Europe for that, actually it was in London, and said that he was very excited about the Revolutions controller and touched on more global views for selling Dragon Quest.
1746093	1746514	You know what?
1746534	1746634	What?
1758866	1761348	This is going to sound really awful, being the gamer that I am.
1761608	1763209	I have never played a single Dragon Quest game.
1763749	1764149	Wow.
1764189	1766191	Gas, that's really interesting.
1766431	1767572	But, I mean, well, we all admit it.
1767732	1769713	I was busy playing Guardian Legend.
1770093	1771654	I didn't see Star Wars until I was in college.
1771894	1773576	I haven't seen Star Wars except for one of them.
1773596	1773876	That's it.
1773896	1775077	Well, there you go.
1775157	1775897	You want to know what's sad?
1775977	1776577	We all have our things.
1776617	1777778	Star Wars was my first movie.
1777838	1778759	I was one years old.
1780200	1780320	Wow.
1780854	1784915	Well, okay, wait, back to, back to, back to, back to Dragon Quest.
1785135	1788776	Okay, so, DarkSakura, Miklatov, you know what game I'm talking about, yes?
1788956	1789376	Yes, yes.
1789416	1790236	Okay, I'll look over here then.
1790456	1791237	It's Toriyama.
1791377	1792337	The game, yeah, the game.
1792357	1793217	Well, I know the art.
1793257	1794998	No, no, no, the one where you have the sword.
1795018	1795798	With the sword.
1795898	1797338	And you go up to the TV and you go, slash.
1797398	1797638	Yeah.
1797698	1798558	It's really cool looking.
1798618	1799579	So this doesn't surprise me at all.
1799999	1803440	But I hope this means we'll, you know, see, you know, some Dragon Quest games on the Revolution.
1803460	1803940	That'll be kind of cool.
1803980	1805260	Or Zelda with the sword.
1805560	1807201	You just made me think about something, though.
1807821	1809001	Playing Rod Calibur.
1810726	1816485	Yes, you can play Soul Calibur with the fishing rod on the Dreamcast Just thought I'd let you guys know
1817771	1820413	But there's a, just to read one of the quotes from this article.
1820713	1825578	It says, when I was making manga, I met with the technology of computer games, he told journalists.
1826158	1829962	I love the fact that it was interactive and that you could do something and you get feedback.
1830062	1833926	I thought it was an interactive story where you could get feedback and rewards from everything that you do.
1833946	1834687	It would be interesting.
1834707	1836728	I like the idea of interactivity with the hardware.
1837209	1842374	So there, when you mention the Nintendo controller, it's a new interface and it's exciting to have that kind of reaction.
1842774	1844455	You do something and it reacts to you.
1844595	1848236	It's human nature to have something feedback from your actions that's rewarding.
1849017	1849897	Very interesting.
1849977	1852758	So we'll see what they decide to produce on the revolution.
1853118	1856120	Loki, you have some more information on what's going on with the revolution.
1856180	1857840	Some of it rumors, some of it facts.
1857860	1858320	What's going on?
1859001	1862122	Some of the stuff, I'm going to consider most of this rumor for now.
1863142	1869505	Well, first off, they had a survey that went out to a couple of gaming sites, one of them being ClassicGaming.com, I believe.
1870106	1899772	and it was talking about the virtual console that they were going to be using as kind of like their storefront for all these retro games that you're going to be able to play and download to your system and they were kind of showing some mock-ups of what the system is going to look like and they have basically where you can choose the different consoles kind of very similar to like a game tap type of thing get the rent or buy games you can do it you know buy each game individually kind of like the Xbox Live Arcade or you can you know
1900233	1905494	Pay a subscription fee and actually be able to download whatever for that month.
1907135	1910255	So I thought that was pretty cool and it kind of ties into that.
1910896	1922739	They have a patent that was actually filed for their virtual console and it kind of covered a few things about how the emulator is going to work.
1922919	1924499	Basically, they're saying that
1925208	1929409	The emulator is actually not going to be downloaded to the system.
1930069	1931850	It's not going to be on the system the entire time.
1931890	1937611	They'll actually kind of download either with the games or will be on some sort of DVD type of thing.
1938251	1949154	The other thing that's talked about is you can actually, they will be able to emulate possibly the portable game systems, of course, like Game Boy and stuff, possibly DS titles.
1949854	1953475	Also, they were saying that the emulation system
1954085	1959109	May be used with other consoles, not necessarily the Nintendo Revolution.
1959169	1965033	Which brings to the point, maybe they're going to license this to other people or something like that.
1965513	1966854	Which is quite interesting.
1966915	1974480	And also, I think we mentioned this a while back on some of the mock-ups for the Revolution where it said choose character.
1975141	1979724	It covers a patent for replacing characters in legacy games.
1980622	2007966	basically being able to use your own avatar say in Super Mario Brothers so you'll be able to play it as Link or Samus or something like that which is interesting so yeah there's some rumor mill stuff the other thing though they did mention though was a list of titles that were going to be kind of launch titles for this virtual console some notable ones for the NES everybody's dying to get this Kid Icarus
2009296	2011998	and I was kind of surprised at the Super Nintendo.
2012018	2020946	They actually have some of the Super Soap 6 games, Battle Clash, the actual Super Soap 6 game and some other stuff.
2021606	2022807	Super Metroid is awesome.
2022847	2031815	And of course, Nintendo 64, you've got to have Pilot Wings, Pokemon Snap, Paper Mario, and GoldenEye.
2032896	2033316	Sweet.
2033703	2037045	Now, through the magic of radio, I actually ran out to go pee while you were talking.
2037385	2040607	So, did you get... You're listening to KTMI.
2040947	2042568	Did you get to the DS redesign one?
2042588	2043728	Because I'm curious about that, too.
2043849	2044309	No, not yet.
2044329	2045209	All right, well, I want to hear this.
2046630	2047771	Jumping to conclusions.
2047791	2051012	Sorry, I just, you know, I'm like, okay, you know, we get it.
2051072	2057736	Nintendo's going to let us download old games, and we can be all fanboyish about what games, but we still don't know shit until E3, really.
2057816	2060217	So this is all redundant to me.
2060277	2060718	No offense.
2060778	2061738	I appreciate you bringing the news.
2061758	2063279	Now, the whole redesign on the DS.
2063619	2065200	Nothing official has been announced yet.
2065300	2070243	That's happening tomorrow, or actually on this Monday, the 16th.
2070743	2072424	Or maybe yesterday, depending on when you're listening to this.
2072444	2073645	Yes, it depends on when you're listening to this.
2074485	2077107	It'll actually be announced on the 16th.
2077147	2079428	They're supposed to make an official announcement about the redesign.
2079808	2085131	Some of the things that they're suspecting are going to be part of this announcement is... Pink.
2085831	2086252	All pink.
2087372	2090594	No, that's going to be more of a rounded, kind of a cell phone-like design.
2091172	2095515	and free voice over IP calls.
2095615	2097576	It's good basically to have that built into it now.
2098396	2099257	The Nintendo gauge.
2100698	2101298	Seriously.
2101738	2112645	No, but the other thing, there are some mock-ups people have done with interesting ideas for it where they're saying the console will fold down to almost like a Game Boy SP type of design.
2113105	2114986	Kind of like a little small case.
2115166	2116527	I thought that was a really cool design.
2116587	2119449	Of course, that was all fan-done, but we'll hear more
2120562	2124485	We'll probably have more next week about this and what announcements are going to be made.
2124525	2127867	Basically, we know that the system is selling like crazy in Japan.
2128267	2129948	They can't keep it on shelves.
2130748	2135291	I thought I read a story this week, though, that the PSP finally outsold it for a week somewhere.
2135311	2136272	I thought I read somewhere at PSP.
2136292	2137472	Only because they didn't have any.
2137492	2139173	Yeah, because they were sold out.
2140394	2140694	Anyways.
2141655	2143936	Don't try to make that system sound like it's better than the DS.
2143996	2145217	No, I'm just saying.
2145317	2146538	I'm just reporting it.
2147983	2157188	Speaking of Nintendo and DS, if you have Animal Crossing DS, hurry up and take your butt on Wi-Fi because there's actually a little special present that you can get right now.
2157628	2161150	And if you go on Wi-Fi, you can just open your gate and close it.
2161591	2167074	But if you go on Wi-Fi, you're going to get a message, a little piece of mail in your box from the president of Nintendo.
2167114	2169095	And enclosed is a Mario coin.
2169636	2170376	I have a Mario coin.
2170396	2173538	And when you tap the A button next to the Mario coin, it goes boing.
2174361	2174781	We phased out...
2200471	2201231	DarkSakura's F.U.
2201251	2201811	of the Week
2226711	2229074	This is the part where we have to get a little bit angsty.
2229134	2231936	Now, chat room, usually you guys submit your FUs.
2232277	2235520	We're going to get to that during the special live program later on in the night.
2235540	2237481	This is just for right now.
2237762	2240644	We're going to do some FUs because, damn it, we're angsty.
2240704	2241405	Right, DarkSakra?
2241765	2242186	Oh, yeah.
2252523	2256105	My F you tonight occurred on the way to the show.
2256125	2262510	F you to people who think that they can pull out of parking lots in front of the oncoming traffic.
2263770	2269794	As in stupid, and also people who decide that they don't want to be in the lane they're in and so they're halfway in that lane and the other.
2270835	2272536	I experienced the two together today.
2273717	2278520	One stupid person in this old beat up looking Cadillac was halfway in
2279295	2287216	the turning lane that I needed to be in and halfway in the going forward lane and then this car decides that he's going to turn in a completely black VW lane and I'm like, uh-uh.
2288377	2290877	I nosed my way up in the Silver Lancer of Love.
2291177	2296258	If this were burnout, this guy would be dead meat.
2297018	2301559	I've nosed up, I pointed at the man and said, you back up.
2301779	2304820	And he just gave me this look of utter surprise and did it.
2304840	2306180	I was like, that's right, you bow down.
2306835	2313858	And then, my car, being the most nimble and beautiful vehicle in existence, managed to navigate around the evil Cadillac.
2314618	2318160	I do not know how I did it, because I had almost no clearance, but I made it.
2318640	2320361	And I am here, and I was here early.
2321181	2323642	So, F you to the morons on the road.
2324623	2325943	Alright, Loki, your F you of the week.
2327164	2336228	Um, basically, my only F you is gonna be that, you know, I have to wait some time to actually get full auto...
2337776	2338396	I want to know.
2339197	2342018	My FU is to the lack of Xbox 360s.
2342118	2344259	Damn you, Microsoft, for not putting enough out there.
2344319	2347520	And damn you, eBayers, for fucking it all up.
2347960	2348821	Nico Todd, do you have an FU?
2349261	2349481	Sure.
2350181	2353402	FU to not having tomorrow off like everybody else in the world.
2353963	2355283	I work for a bank, so I get off.
2355723	2356004	All right.
2358525	2358885	All right.
2360565	2361386	Hey, that was PC.
2365123	2367444	All right, so that was our FUs of the week.
2367624	2369244	I have to do something that I've promised.
2369445	2369805	What's that?
2370485	2372926	Hello to Mistress Tia in the chat room.
2375046	2375427	Thank you.
2376027	2378528	All right, don't forget, we tape our podcast live now, everybody.
2378548	2380868	If you're going like, what the F are these people on?
2381889	2382709	All right, moving on.
2382749	2384610	Let's get to our next article tonight.
2385410	2387471	Loki, what's going on with the game Gun?
2387511	2388731	When's the sequel coming out?
2389752	2393233	The sequel's coming out probably either close to never.
2394972	2400535	Yes, Gun and True Crime unfortunately weren't the breakout hits that they had hoped they would be.
2401876	2406499	And it's rumored now that they've actually been cancelled due to low sales of both games.
2407760	2411102	And actually I can kind of back this up distribution wise.
2411142	2419167	Anybody that's direct with Activision right now is actually getting a nice price break on the Gun and True Crime New York City.
2419407	2422208	They're selling them for about $10 a pop.
2422969	2423950	Of course you have to buy like 4,000 units but
2425910	2429672	The point is that the game's not selling what it's supposed to be.
2429992	2435874	I thought they were really good games, but apparently I was wrong.
2436814	2440335	Now, what's going on with Ragnarok Online?
2440375	2443637	This is a follow-up to something we talked about last week on the show, right?
2445017	2446998	Mm-hmm.
2447278	2448118	You're pouting over there.
2448178	2448398	Why?
2449259	2450159	Loki has to say.
2450937	2451498	What's up, Loki?
2451718	2455361	Well, there was a rumor that Ragnarok Online was coming to the DS.
2455422	2458384	Of course, it ended up being another funny Photoshop.
2459005	2464290	So somebody actually Photoshopped from Famitsu Magazine some article to make it look like Ragnarok was actually coming on the DS.
2464590	2466892	Do you think it was someone that listens to the show that got the idea?
2467153	2467373	No.
2468073	2468354	Maybe.
2468534	2468754	Maybe.
2468814	2469215	You never know.
2469535	2469855	Doubt it.
2470155	2471297	We do have listeners in Japan.
2471577	2472017	That's true.
2472438	2472678	It's true.
2472718	2473078	You never know.
2473959	2474239	All right.
2475936	2477057	Guitar Freaks Guitar Hero Guitar Freaks
2496502	2498464	One of the major importers.
2499005	2505814	There is news that there is a super deluxe Japanese arcade style controller for Guitar Freaks coming out.
2506836	2506916	Um...
2508306	2513489	To go ahead and read this quote, I'm just going to read directly from here.
2513529	2518293	Last night, Konami gave the green light for the production of the ASC guitar for use with Guitar Freaks games.
2518333	2528079	Although the final specs of the guitar are not available for perusal yet, the company's website specifies that it will be modeled closely after the guitar used at the Coinop GF machines.
2529002	2532847	Now, you can't use a Guitar Freaks controller, though, on a Guitar Hero game.
2532987	2533648	That's important to know.
2533668	2534329	Actually, yes, you can.
2534469	2534750	Can you?
2534850	2536232	I thought I read an article that said you couldn't.
2536392	2536913	Yes, you can.
2536993	2537213	How?
2537914	2538515	You plug it in.
2539216	2541358	But what about the... Can you only play the three?
2541378	2543381	You can only play an easy, but you can use it.
2543541	2543982	It will work.
2544282	2544583	Weird.
2544623	2545424	I thought that you couldn't do it.
2545444	2546205	You just can't will hard.
2547116	2548357	Digg.com
2569966	2573848	This is a good way for you to, you know, cut loose, so to speak.
2574348	2578370	You remind me of one of the more embarrassing moments in my relationship with my husband.
2578390	2579090	Oh, then you must share.
2579291	2579951	You must share.
2581492	2588175	I go into the living room one day at one of our older apartments, and Dan, I was playing pata pata, and I went off, like, to go to the bathroom or something.
2588195	2592857	I come back in, and Dan's got the guitar freaks controller doing air guitar freaks to pata pata.
2594878	2597319	Like, it was frightening.
2598140	2598440	Wow.
2598968	2599188	Wow.
2599268	2600209	Air Guitar Freaks.
2602010	2602871	Creative.
2603331	2606614	So I'm going to patent that idea and sell it to Konami.
2608415	2608996	Air Guitar Freaks.
2609016	2609576	You can try.
2610677	2611698	Using the eye toy.
2613039	2614140	We'll see what happens.
2614673	2614753	E.A.
2614773	2616834	is bringing Lord of the Rings Battle for Middle-Earth 2.
2635672	2637992	to Xbox 360 in the summertime.
2638573	2642353	It's a real-time strategy game based on the PC version that's due out on March 3rd.
2642493	2643093	That's in the UK.
2643693	2647674	And it will be the first Lord of the Rings game to work on Xbox Live.
2647694	2654315	They're saying it will have a new and intuitive console-specific control scheme.
2655816	2657096	And I like the quote in here.
2657116	2658636	It says, A promise is a promise, EA.
2658696	2659296	Remember that.
2661217	2662637	So I thought that was very interesting.
2662657	2663457	Them spiting words.
2663477	2663717	Yep.
2664739	2692837	also another one that I am personally very excited about is Sonic Riders because one of my favorite games of all time is Sonic R that's a great game, that's an amazing game right there and I actually have Sonic R for the PC which I still play because it's hard to go back and play it on the Saturn because the graphics are just so much better on the PC one and I do have it on Saturn as well but Sonic Riders just looks like it's Sonic R done right, you know what I mean?
2693477	2696499	Anything that was wrong in Sonic R, Sonic Riders is doing better.
2696819	2703342	They all have these hoverboard things and basically shoot through levels that look like they're ripped right out of Sonic Adventure.
2703362	2703962	It's pretty cool.
2704563	2708104	As long as Super Sonic Racing is in that song, I'll be happy.
2710386	2711126	Sega loves us.
2711146	2712046	Really?
2712066	2714027	Where's the free games then?
2716064	2716904	Hey!
2716985	2718426	Why is Phantasy Star delayed?
2719147	2719748	I know!
2720709	2721489	I get the free games.
2721970	2722290	Shut up.
2728357	2731400	There's actually also another thing in here too that I thought was kind of neat.
2731620	2734123	It actually makes me think of Arctic Thunder.
2735226	2735546	It's tricky!
2735586	2737547	Game on, it's tricky!
2759113	2760694	Bad joke, if you've ever played SSX.
2760854	2765936	Four of the tracks listed are Metal City, Splash Canyon, Egg Factory, and Sand Ruins.
2765996	2766876	Where's Casino Zone?
2766896	2768817	Because every Sonic game's got to have a casino zone.
2768837	2769417	You need Casino Night, okay?
2769437	2772158	There's always a casino or pinball zone or something.
2772258	2774279	You know what the music I would love to hear in this?
2774299	2774519	What's that?
2774539	2777280	I would love to hear a remix of the Ice Cap music from Sonic 3.
2777320	2779641	The little disco-y dance-y one.
2779661	2780541	I thought it was pretty cool.
2781101	2782562	It was like trance and 16-bit.
2783707	2790230	Also, one other game coming out, Sengoku Basara sequel coming out for PS2, put out by Capcom.
2791811	2805078	And the original development team is returning for that, including Kobayashi Hiroyuki, who is behind Resident Evil 4, and Yamamoto Makoto, who is Piano 3, which that game wasn't all that great, but still.
2805158	2807959	Okay, I'm going to admit, I've never even heard of Sengoku Basara 1.
2808059	2808940	What are these games?
2810501	2813062	It's... This one's actually...
2813684	2818690	They... I'm trying... It's a historical beat-em-up type game.
2819311	2819871	Oh, okay.
2819891	2821153	Like a Dynasty Warriors or something?
2821193	2822014	Yeah.
2822054	2826599	But this one... And I just know, because I know several people who are into the series, so I thought I would mention it.
2827480	2834048	But this one, they actually have an art of one of the new characters, who is Maeda Keiji, who is...
2834844	2836444	They say a historical warrior.
2836564	2844346	Actually, I have a year on here, 1543 to 1612, who lived during the reign of Toyotomi Hideyoshi in the Sengoku period.
2844986	2847647	So that was pretty cool.
2847667	2847927	All right.
2848607	2849887	And then something about a contest?
2850127	2853128	Yes, a contest for folks in the UK.
2854368	2855448	Can I enter?
2856268	2856408	No.
2856648	2857909	Oh, this is a sucky contest.
2858529	2859069	It's not fair.
2860339	2864081	Would you like to win a DS and Prince of Persia?
2879318	2884541	Basically, with this particular contest, you can, again, win Battles of Prince of Persia and a DS.
2885142	2889024	The entry is on Yahoo UK Games.
2889864	2891065	So just give a clue.
2891125	2899230	Actually, I'll go ahead and... The URL is very long, so just go to Yahoo UK and Ireland Games and give it a hunt.
2900051	2906454	Now, if you win, and you heard about it from us, you're going to have to cut your DS in half and send half to us, because that's our commission.
2906855	2908916	So we get one screen of your DS if you win.
2909699	2910480	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2932100	2934502	Blood Rain was set to open in 1,900 theaters.
2959488	2965352	It ended up showing less than 1,000 screens and, like I said, made barely a million dollars.
2965793	2969996	In addition, hundreds of theaters reported receiving prints of the film that they didn't order.
2970336	2972197	Needless to say, they refused to screen them.
2973658	2974699	That's a wonderful tactic.
2974759	2980303	Send the prints to the theaters that won't carry it so that they might accidentally put it on screen.
2981163	2983365	In other news, Uybol is a giant douche.
2984246	2987468	Basically, he hates everything that has to do... Don't hold back now.
2988137	2992219	He hates everything that has to do with Hollywood, calling them as greedy thieves.
2992339	2996501	Those greedy thieves are paying to finance your movies, ironically enough.
2997302	3009008	Also, during the premiere for BloodRayne, actors were brought on stage so Evil can make a little speech, but forced them not to speak because he hates when actors talk.
3010109	3014971	And finally, I don't know, he's just... He's really in the right business.
3015211	3016632	Yeah, he's just
3017375	3021303	I read that on the internet so it must be true.
3029332	3030233	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3051273	3051933	and you know what?
3051953	3054094	We're getting Silent Hill and that looks amazing.
3054114	3054774	April 21st.
3054834	3055494	April 21st.
3055514	3058155	Pyramid Head's going to be up in thinking half.
3058175	3061675	Two days after my birthday so whoever wants to buy me a ticket to see it.
3062555	3063636	See, we're going to get a good movie.
3063836	3066096	Why not get a bad movie in the form of Metal Gear Solid?
3066176	3066956	I think it would be great.
3066996	3067817	Because it's solid.
3068077	3069917	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
3070177	3070797	You know what we need?
3071397	3079339	We need to have Snake done by someone really hot but voiced over by David Hayter and have David Hayter write the script.
3080174	3082136	DarkSakura, you were telling me a little bit about this before the show.
3082156	3082656	What's going on here?
3082676	3084458	Well, there are some very...
3106608	3111912	There's a bit of a speculative article about for the game year in review for 2010.
3111992	3115855	This made me... In the year 2010.
3115895	3120698	Yeah, thank you.
3120738	3122399	Never mind, you don't watch TV, so you don't get it.
3122419	3123280	It's Conan O'Brien.
3123360	3124561	I don't watch TV.
3124581	3125742	I have a life.
3125802	3127003	It's the show to watch.
3127243	3128324	Every college kid loves.
3129084	3130505	I know we're older than college kids.
3130645	3132286	No, I'm a college kid.
3132306	3133107	At heart, we're college kids.
3133127	3134108	You know what I'm busy doing?
3134528	3134848	College?
3135349	3135989	Playing Animal Crossing.
3137248	3142252	Dude, I'm taking Flash Animation, what are you talking about?
3143373	3152201	Well, the speculation is Sony's attempt to hang on to its thin lead in the gaming industry by only selling the PlayStation 4 to 6 carefully chosen celebrities.
3152779	3154480	Seems like it might backfire.
3155661	3159703	Children's crayon drawings of the PS4 going for over $400 on eBay.
3159963	3163545	Please tell me, for the love of God, Paris Hilton will not still be a celebrity in 2010.
3163925	3168387	Paris Hilton is reported to have held the new console briefly at arm's length before throwing it in the closet.
3168467	3169208	God damn it.
3172069	3173170	Who made these predictions, Ms.
3173190	3173550	Cleo?
3174331	3176572	Nintendo creates the Nintendo apocalypse.
3177893	3181255	that will like any type of game controller whatsoever.
3181415	3183336	How about the Nintendo Fuck Your Shit Up?
3183636	3189259	Instead, you will direct the on-screen action by grabbing a household pet by the front legs and making it do a little dance.
3191260	3193701	This is the exciting wheelbarrow controller.
3195442	3198063	Featuring WarioWare Yardwork mode.
3198183	3198784	That'd be great.
3198904	3202946	Nintendo Faithful pointed out this is still better than a gamepad for first-person shooters.
3204036	3211698	On the handheld front, Sony and Nintendo continue their fight for the minds and backpacks of the nation's gamers by releasing ever-larger portable consoles.
3212058	3216560	The Nintendo XL with six screens, a folding seat, and selection of overpriced candy bars.
3217080	3224122	While the PlayStation's still ostensibly portal, can now play all forms of media, including two-ton cuneiform tablets.
3224302	3225202	This is absurd.
3225362	3225782	This is absurd.
3225802	3227083	Where can people read this?
3227263	3228323	This is unwired.
3228883	3229923	Wired.com.
3230263	3235025	I'll post the link in the chat room for those listeners privileged to hang out there.
3236605	3243888	We're getting towards the end of the show here, believe it or not, but what a good way to go out than to talk about sex.
3244868	3247349	Let's talk about sex, baby.
3247409	3249810	Let's talk about sex on the Xbox 360.
3249870	3252110	Not literally sex on your Xbox 360, but Loki.
3252290	3252871	You probably could.
3252911	3253671	It's big enough.
3254431	3257052	On that power supply, you might be able to do something raunchy with that.
3257603	3258904	All right, kids, cover your ears.
3258964	3260025	Rez controller time.
3260645	3261165	Loki.
3261766	3263327	Let's try to keep it clean, Loki.
3263927	3266149	What's this with HD porn coming into 360?
3266189	3268110	This has to be a load of crap, right?
3268530	3272593	No, actually, the first movie that they're bringing over, there's a couple companies there behind it.
3272653	3280658	The first one being Arrow Productions, which is bringing the HD version of Deep Throat, very classic adult film, to the Xbox 360.
3281059	3282920	I'm not quite sure...
3283955	3288799	How they're going to do this, or what format it's going to be in, I don't know.
3290360	3297025	My guess is probably WMV HD format, so Windows Media.
3297586	3299647	Anyways, so look forward to that.
3299707	3301829	There's actually going to be some more info about it.
3302749	3307173	DeepthroatHD.com is where you'll want to watch for the news on that.
3307253	3308674	How do we know this isn't a load of crap?
3309477	3311298	Just because the website's registered, I don't know.
3312238	3314339	I'm taking this with a huge grain of salt here.
3315200	3321263	How could they possibly... This is actually from the adult video conference.
3321743	3326545	Basically, they had a DVD version and this HD version playing side by side.
3326865	3336990	But see, the whole thing that makes me real skeptical about this, and this is where I'm going into for Next Company, which is actually... Let's see here.
3338561	3339041	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3368491	3369571	Is there ever?
3370732	3371632	Well, you know me.
3371712	3373092	I'm such a little horn dog.
3373132	3375373	I had to find about Sex and Video Games Conference.
3376773	3389076	There is a conference going on in San Francisco June 8th to 9th at the Knob Hill Masonic Center that is the Sex and Video Games Conference exploring the business of digital erotic entertainment.
3390456	3395938	Panels include Creating Mainstream Erotic Games, Integrating International Success to the U.S.
3396038	3396418	Market,
3397145	3411173	Emergent Sex and Video Games and Video Game Hardware, Creating Successful Online Erotic Games, Investing in Sexually Themed Games, Alternative Distribution Methods for AO Games, and MMOEG Panel.
3412894	3414975	Massively Multiplayer Online Erotic Game?
3415835	3417176	Was that orgy the game?
3418717	3419577	Orgy for PC.
3421518	3426041	DarkSakura, I think you need to do some field work and attend this conference and bring back a full report.
3427093	3427813	Do you want to pay for it?
3428374	3428534	No.
3428574	3429374	How much is it to go?
3429394	3429815	Do we know?
3429835	3430535	Probably too much.
3431035	3433096	Well, you can save over 40% of the registration fee by signing in for it by May 7, 2006.
3433157	3433597	Early bird price is $295.
3433637	3433977	Through June 6, $395.
3434077	3434257	On-site, $495.
3434297	3435738	They better have naked chicks there.
3435758	3437139	You know what that would be, though?
3437719	3437799	Huh?
3437839	3439100	That would be half the price of my new iMac.
3439120	3439280	So, no.
3439300	3439820	All right.
3457617	3459738	Last thing for the night, and then we're going to call it a show.
3462099	3464180	This whole sex in video games thing makes me think.
3464980	3468201	Are video games sexy enough or too sexy?
3468221	3472783	And if you're going to say not sexy enough, what could they do to make games more sexy?
3473063	3473583	DarkSakura.
3473804	3475724	See, I think that I'm actually too sexy for the games.
3476485	3477225	No, no, no.
3477445	3478505	You misinterpreted my question.
3481687	3482247	You know what?
3482327	3482667	You know what?
3483416	3489017	I'm going to go back, because the old standby, our motto, applies to this.
3490758	3491318	Gameplay!
3492238	3494558	It is the gameplay that makes a game good.
3494598	3511822	It does not have to have hot, naked people in it, and, you know, pantsless rage, and... It doesn't need to have all of... You know, I think it's fine to make it attractive, and I think that if the, you know... I do have to say that the average...
3512919	3513259	Lokey?
3540962	3547932	I would say it's a complete waste of the whole next-gen of gaming.
3548973	3550554	We do not have HD titties in there.
3550694	3554517	Because goddammit, we need HD titties to be on this next-gen console.
3555018	3556459	Where are my adult-only games?
3556579	3563184	If they have a goddamn adult-only rating system, I want adult games to be on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.
3564125	3565566	I want my nudity.
3566146	3567787	And I want my extreme violence as well.
3567887	3570609	I want things that will make Jack Thompson go crazy.
3571090	3577335	And in fact, I want the next Grand Theft Auto to be so outrageous and bad that it's banned from half the world.
3578200	3579020	Only I get to play.
3579381	3582262	That's what I want to see because I think that's what we need.
3582402	3582902	And you know what?
3583142	3584683	I agree with you about the gameplay.
3585163	3586444	That's where the revolution comes in.
3586504	3590386	And damn it, Nintendo didn't get to jump on this bandwagon with, you know, sex games.
3590706	3592286	I can't wait to see Playboy the Mansion 2.
3592667	3593567	Is that the revolution?
3593627	3594427	Full frontal nudity?
3595008	3595688	Res 2.
3596588	3598809	Alright, comments from our chat room.
3598849	3599510	We have some folks.
3599790	3602211	More naked males, of course, you know.
3602651	3605232	The women and gay men, you know, need some cock.
3605252	3606713	As far as the asexuals, though.
3606853	3607013	What?
3607856	3608456	They have Tetris.
3610318	3610618	Let's see.
3611619	3616922	Some various comments here from Fireboma and GS191.
3617263	3617983	More Cowbell.
3619464	3620865	We do need more Cowbell.
3622266	3622626	All right.
3622727	3627770	On that note, I think it's about time we wrap things up here on Orange Lounge Radio.
3628311	3629972	It was a great first show, though.
3630032	3632213	Thank you guys for tuning in and listening or downloading it.
3632273	3633274	It was a little different.
3633314	3636216	I think some of our folks who listened to previous podcasts might be shocked.
3636336	3636656	But it's 170.
3637782	3638583	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3656092	3659314	No Grand Theft DDR evil chatroom.
3659734	3660775	Stop paying attention to the chatroom.
3660795	3661235	They'll go away.
3662516	3664297	All right, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
3664337	3668059	Miklatov, I know you didn't talk a whole lot tonight, but thank you for being here and being moral support.
3668459	3669000	You're welcome.
3669580	3672442	And anything you want for games to be sexier?
3673662	3675183	No, because I think that's kind of stupid.
3676124	3677305	Except if it's hot guys.
3677385	3678605	Other than that, it's stupid.
3678625	3679366	And what's your final thought?
3679606	3682688	Oh, I want to play some more World of Warcraft right now.
3683168	3683468	All right.
3684089	3684849	Loki, your final thought.
3685533	3687934	I'm going to check out DOA 4 this week.
3688554	3693016	My final thought is I want an Xbox 360 at the store.
3694657	3695577	DarkSakura, your final thought?
3696778	3697578	Reject false icons.
3698498	3699419	All right, that's going to do it.
3699459	3702140	Thanks so much for tuning in and listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
3702160	3703060	We'll see you next week.
3705521	3708903	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
