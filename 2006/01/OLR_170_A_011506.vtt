00:00.000 --> 00:19.080

00:19.080 --> 00:22.940
EDR goes to the next level with supernova and talk on everything from

00:22.940 --> 00:25.080
from edutainment to sex and video games.

00:25.080 --> 00:27.080
The Orange Lounge Radio.

00:32.320 --> 00:33.980
Good evening everybody.

00:33.980 --> 00:38.240
Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio episode number 170

00:38.240 --> 00:41.880
for this January the 15th of 2006.

00:41.880 --> 00:44.400
That's right, it's our first show of the new format.

00:44.400 --> 00:46.960
We've kinda taken our live show and our podcast

00:46.960 --> 00:49.000
and sorta combined the two together.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.640
So if you're wondering, hey wait a minute,

00:50.640 --> 00:54.400
when the hell did things go from episode 54 to 170?

00:54.400 --> 00:56.600
Well, that's because when we heard Orange on this Radio,

00:56.600 --> 00:58.140
I've actually been doing a live program

00:58.140 --> 00:59.260
for the past three years,

00:59.260 --> 01:02.280
solely dedicated to music and rhythm games.

01:02.280 --> 01:04.680
But tonight the shows come together for the first time

01:04.680 --> 01:07.200
to allow our listeners to actually interact

01:07.200 --> 01:08.780
with the program as well.

01:08.780 --> 01:11.080
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

01:11.080 --> 01:14.400
Joining me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura.

01:14.400 --> 01:15.800
How you doing?

01:15.800 --> 01:17.520
Oh, what am I not doing?

01:17.520 --> 01:18.520
Oh, how am I doing?

01:18.520 --> 01:20.000
I'm sorry.

01:20.000 --> 01:27.300
Fairly decent. Yeah fairly decent I can say good. All right. How you doing over there Loki our other co-host tech master

01:27.300 --> 01:30.300
Loki I'm doing good. Good. Excellent and

01:31.100 --> 01:33.100
since we have

01:33.340 --> 01:38.000
Our live element now and one other thing we would usually do on our live program is we'd allow

01:38.020 --> 01:41.160
some other folks to come in and sit in on the show and sort of have a

01:41.380 --> 01:44.400
Fourth guest so to speak of sorts a fourth person

01:44.400 --> 01:50.140
So we're pleased to have our very first guest of the new format an old favorite though

01:50.400 --> 01:53.520
In fact, so old he's getting a little bit moldy. Say hello to

01:54.220 --> 01:58.620
Shane also known as Miklotov. How you doing? I just got hit by a blue show

01:58.620 --> 02:01.940
What do you what do you play? Are you playing Mario Kart during the show?

02:01.980 --> 02:05.900
Yeah, all right for those that don't know Miklotov since he's you know

02:05.900 --> 02:10.980
Kind of new to our podcast listeners Shane's an old friend of ours that actually now he works for Konami

02:10.980 --> 02:16.260
me but with all those NDA's we're not allowed to say like what he does or what

02:16.260 --> 02:19.860
he's doing or any of that stuff right if you look at instruction manuals for

02:19.860 --> 02:24.300
games you can totally find out what I do and what I'm doing so all right just

02:24.300 --> 02:28.740

02:52.360 --> 02:56.120

interact with us if you're listening through the podcast stream that's just

02:59.600 --> 03:04.880
incentive to be here on Sunday nights but of course you can always you know

03:04.880 --> 03:08.160
drop in there because we have other live shows that go on throughout the week and

03:08.160 --> 03:12.240
it's a good time so it is our first show I'm feeling a little good about this a

03:12.240 --> 03:16.320
little bit of a little bit of a change going on here at the same time I'm a

03:16.320 --> 03:19.760
little nervous but I'm hoping I'm hoping you guys like the change I'm feeling

03:19.760 --> 03:26.480
good about the change though what do you guys know I'm just depressed as I can be

03:26.480 --> 03:31.400
and my heart is broken I feel awful no I'm actually pretty happy with it a

03:31.400 --> 03:37.960
piece of you has died inside my soul is dark and empty I think the biggest shock

03:37.960 --> 03:41.220
will probably come to people to listen on the podcast because we had such a you

03:41.220 --> 03:44.320
know like duh duh duh duh duh duh like we were always just like going down this

03:44.320 --> 03:46.780
bullet list of things but now we have now we have a little time to relax

03:46.780 --> 03:50.700
because we're gonna be two hours now so our podcast is broken up into sections

03:50.700 --> 03:54.060
which means you'll get it two times throughout the week so you know twice

03:54.060 --> 03:57.580
the orange lounge but we have a little more time to kick back and relax get the

03:57.580 --> 04:03.220
full OLR experience exactly so let's um let's start it off let's go around how

04:03.220 --> 04:06.580
we always see what used to start things off and talk about how our gaming weeks

04:06.580 --> 04:12.020
have been going so uh dark sakura how's your gaming week been i'd have to say it's been pretty lame

04:12.900 --> 04:17.220
why is that um i want to play this animal crossing just because i'm getting ready to

04:17.220 --> 04:23.940
start my next semester next week god help me um that and i have a pretty nasty sinus infections

04:23.940 --> 04:29.700
i've been getting motion sick every time i play anything even animal crossing doesn't that suck

04:29.700 --> 04:35.620
how do you motion sick playing here to go oh my god fluid in my head something that you don't

04:35.620 --> 04:39.140
really hear a lot about sometimes I mean we always see those warnings before we

04:39.140 --> 04:42.900
start to play video games so we never really hear about a lot of experiences

04:42.900 --> 04:46.100
so I am one of those people who gets motion stick playing first-person

04:46.100 --> 04:49.860
shooters or watching them do you have you ever taken things to try it like you

04:49.860 --> 04:54.380
know how like people get cars to take your I mean I mean is like it passed it

04:54.380 --> 04:57.540
makes you pass out and it's really nasty stuff and not good for you at all I've

04:57.540 --> 05:02.220
tried taking ginger before trying to play goldeneye back on the n64 right

05:02.220 --> 05:05.340
Goldeneye is the first video game I have ever played that made me throw up.

05:06.220 --> 05:07.680
That's that's hardcore though.

05:07.680 --> 05:12.480
I watched I was watching Dan play it and I was I wanted to do the two-person

05:12.480 --> 05:18.540
But also if the screen is split like that with the two-person mode, I can't do it even more even on like PSO

05:19.620 --> 05:24.100
Sonic Adventure made me nauseous, but I love that game and I just sort of pushed through it

05:24.100 --> 05:28.060
Yeah, I was gonna say these are above a point where you're just like screw it. I'll just get sick

05:28.060 --> 05:29.060
just to play this game.

05:29.060 --> 05:30.060
Katamari.

05:30.060 --> 05:31.820
Katamari to mashi makes me very motion sick.

05:31.820 --> 05:34.700
That's like how I get sick if I eat really spicy foods, but like once in a while it's

05:34.700 --> 05:35.700
like, you know what, screw it.

05:35.700 --> 05:36.700
I want Mongolian barbecue.

05:36.700 --> 05:37.700
I want it all.

05:37.700 --> 05:43.100
Well, I did actually start to put Beatmania in and then Dan got sick.

05:43.100 --> 05:46.580
He turns into such a baby when he's sick.

05:46.580 --> 05:47.580
But he's not motion sick.

05:47.580 --> 05:49.580
He's like virus sick.

05:49.580 --> 05:52.580
Yeah, he's got like the flu or something.

05:52.580 --> 05:53.880
He's feeling better.

05:53.880 --> 06:00.680
But I did play DDR at Fry's today, and that whatever ignition pad, fake pad thing they

06:00.680 --> 06:04.860
have there is a piece of ass, as in a skanky piece of ass.

06:04.860 --> 06:09.360
So it was like, right in the middle, you know where you stand, is where the left arrow was,

06:09.360 --> 06:11.160
where the sensor had moved.

06:11.160 --> 06:16.200
Well think about all those kids that sit around and play that, not really sit around, stomp

06:16.200 --> 06:19.760
around like, you know, stomp, stomp, they're breaking that thing every five minutes.

06:19.760 --> 06:23.200
I was like, come on, get me some DDR on, it's been a while, you know, I put in only, and

06:23.200 --> 06:24.920
You know how I am on Only You.

06:24.920 --> 06:26.920
I freakin' will combo that thing.

06:26.920 --> 06:30.160
And I was like, oh, no left, I suck.

06:30.160 --> 06:32.300
So I went and bought DVD-Rs.

06:32.300 --> 06:33.140
Okay.

06:33.140 --> 06:33.980
I was at Fry's.

06:33.980 --> 06:35.120
For things.

06:35.120 --> 06:36.920
Things of undisclosed.

06:36.920 --> 06:38.040
Of undisclosed natures.

06:38.040 --> 06:40.040
All right, I was at Fry's the other day, too.

06:40.040 --> 06:41.000
It was a good time.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.080
For those that don't know,

06:42.080 --> 06:44.440
because you know we're like a worldwide show thing now,

06:44.440 --> 06:46.320
I keep, it's like, whoa, I gotta keep.

06:46.320 --> 06:48.280
We are international.

06:48.280 --> 06:50.920
Fry's is like a huge electronics store

06:50.920 --> 06:52.360
that exists out here,

06:52.360 --> 06:57.320
So it's kind of like nerd heaven in many ways, but your pocketbooks burn when you go there.

06:57.320 --> 06:59.040
And I shouldn't be giving them free advertising, but...

06:59.040 --> 07:01.880
Well, I was actually hanging out with the fabulous Ms. Tia today.

07:01.880 --> 07:02.880
Ah, yes.

07:02.880 --> 07:06.280
Mr. Tia was on the last live show we did last week.

07:06.280 --> 07:10.840
And she put up with me ogling over the 30-inch Mac displays.

07:10.840 --> 07:11.840
Oh, $3,000!

07:11.840 --> 07:16.600
I could build five computers for that!

07:16.600 --> 07:21.580
But I have made the decision that once Dan and I have talked about it, I am going to

07:21.580 --> 07:25.820
be making the jump to Macintosh in the next couple of months.

07:25.820 --> 07:27.820
Loki, I know you've got an opinion on this.

07:27.820 --> 07:28.980
I'm getting an Intel iMac.

07:28.980 --> 07:30.740
I'm trying to start shit here.

07:30.740 --> 07:32.980
Loki, what's your opinion on this?

07:32.980 --> 07:38.100
Well, you know, some people drive a DeLorean 80 miles

07:38.100 --> 07:40.980
an hour to go back to the past.

07:40.980 --> 07:42.540
But hey, jump to a Mac.

07:42.540 --> 07:45.900
That'll set you back a couple of years.

07:45.900 --> 07:47.500
I'm sorry, what planet are you from?

07:47.500 --> 07:50.040
You can address those cards and letters to Loki at Orange

07:50.040 --> 07:55.040
I'm going to have a system that will run circles around your PC.

07:55.040 --> 07:57.040
Wow, look at all that Mac gaming out there.

07:57.040 --> 07:58.040
Wait, oh wait, I'm sorry.

07:58.040 --> 08:00.040
Excuse me, I'm a graphic artist.

08:00.040 --> 08:01.040
Hello?

08:01.040 --> 08:03.040
I'm a graphic artist.

08:03.040 --> 08:05.040
Well, I'm glad it can do something.

08:05.040 --> 08:08.040
You are so full of shit.

08:08.040 --> 08:10.040
I love getting to start off the new show with a good fight.

08:10.040 --> 08:19.040
You know what, it's just because he's holding onto this antiquated idea that a Macintosh is for losers

08:19.040 --> 08:23.360
losers when actually it is far superior to practically any PC and on top of that

08:23.360 --> 08:27.880
I can install Windows on my damn Mac with my new with my new iMac if I want to

08:27.880 --> 08:32.160
call it breathe in calm it calm down breathe in what is this Dell crap

08:32.160 --> 08:41.680
popping up on my computer anymore alright alright anything else to share

08:41.680 --> 08:48.040
about your gaming week I need some rope and a big stick and some fire I'm gonna

08:48.040 --> 08:53.960
roast me a co-host. Loki, how was your gaming week? My gaming week was good. I

08:53.960 --> 08:58.600
played a lot of Animal Crossing, just, I don't know, because I'm too lazy to set up

08:58.600 --> 09:03.840
game systems to play any, you know, console systems or whatever. Then I

09:03.840 --> 09:08.440
played a little bit of Call of Duty 2, more of the single-player and some of

09:08.440 --> 09:13.560
the multiplayer, because it's just fun. But I did buy more games. I bought DOA4,

09:13.560 --> 09:19.480
Haven't played that yet and I was trying to booby fight 2006 exactly

09:19.480 --> 09:22.240
It says it has partial nudity in it, which is pretty sweet

09:22.240 --> 09:27.160
Then it's very promising to have a game that has partial nudity and aren't some of those costumes

09:27.160 --> 09:30.840
Just partial nudity on their own. I guess you know, it's kind of disappointing

09:30.840 --> 09:36.800
I'm still waiting for Rumblerone's as XX, you know in a couple months that game's gonna be hot so hot

09:36.840 --> 09:41.040
It's got bears in it bears in the hot broads fighting each other

09:41.040 --> 09:46.720
that is what we need more of in this world anyways but uh I don't know I'm

09:46.720 --> 09:49.600
just looking forward to like some of these new demos coming out and stuff

09:49.600 --> 09:55.280
especially now that there's gonna be that Final Fantasy 11 beta that's gonna

09:55.280 --> 09:59.520
be in the next official Xbox magazine so that should be coming out in a couple

09:59.520 --> 10:02.360
weeks is that already out there because I'm looking on message boards and I've

10:02.360 --> 10:05.140
seen and you know how like a lot of people are using their little Xbox

10:05.140 --> 10:08.960
gamer cards and their signature now and you can see like the little boxes that

10:08.960 --> 10:12.020
shown what what accomplishments they've gotten lately if you see those look at

10:12.020 --> 10:13.400
what the stars that yeah

10:13.400 --> 10:16.720
okay I saw somebody's on a random message word the other day cuz I work on

10:16.720 --> 10:17.240
a lot of more

10:17.240 --> 10:20.940
message words out there and somebody had like a play online square in there is

10:20.940 --> 10:22.360
not a minute

10:22.360 --> 10:25.400
well when did this happen when did the play online thing happen well

10:25.400 --> 10:28.160
it might have already I'm not sure I haven't really looked to see if the

10:28.160 --> 10:29.560
magazines are out there yet

10:29.560 --> 10:33.240
I believe it was the 16th is when the official a new stand

10:33.240 --> 10:37.200
okay well that would be tomorrow yeah well people get early still

10:37.200 --> 10:42.040
Yeah, so I don't know, I guess the people that have subscriptions might have already

10:42.040 --> 10:43.320
gotten them already.

10:43.320 --> 10:47.280
I have a subscription, but you know how it takes eight weeks and all that kind of crap.

10:47.280 --> 10:51.720
So yeah, I'm looking forward to that stuff, but right now I just haven't been playing

10:51.720 --> 10:52.720
too much.

10:52.720 --> 10:56.900
I want to really get back into playing more console games, and there are some games coming

10:56.900 --> 11:01.940
out that I want to check out for like Playstation 2 and stuff, and I tried acquiring a game

11:01.940 --> 11:09.940
for the PSP DJ Maxx that Beatmania Korean sim type thing but it's a little bigger than

11:09.940 --> 11:18.760
my memory card so I actually remembered one more thing we were gonna break out the Turbo

11:18.760 --> 11:26.940
Duo because I now have thanks to one of our good listening friends Space Fantasy Zone

11:26.940 --> 11:29.740
It's not one of those games you kept saying you wanted?

11:29.740 --> 11:37.020
It was a prototype, and I now have Space Fantasy Zone, and Emerald Dragon, which actually I

11:37.020 --> 11:42.380
don't think I can play because I'd need to have an arcade card, which the duo never had.

11:42.380 --> 11:46.260
It had, I think, up to the second card, so that means I actually have to find a duo or

11:46.260 --> 11:49.500
our ex now to be able to play it.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.980
Anything else in your gaming league, Logie?

11:50.980 --> 11:51.980
Nope.

11:51.980 --> 11:52.980
Move on or take over here?

11:52.980 --> 11:54.540
Actually, my gaming league wasn't that exciting.

11:54.540 --> 11:55.700
I haven't played a whole lot of new stuff.

11:55.700 --> 11:57.180
I've been playing a lot of the same old stuff.

11:57.180 --> 12:02.540
I mean, again, we don't really get free copies of games from people, so whenever any of us

12:02.540 --> 12:06.980
talk about a new game we've played, most likely we have went out and bought it, if we didn't

12:06.980 --> 12:10.940
borrow it from somebody or, I don't know, low-key hacked something.

12:10.940 --> 12:12.980
But I know for me, I usually buy it.

12:12.980 --> 12:17.180
I'd like to add, just real quick, since you mentioned buying games.

12:17.180 --> 12:21.780
Because I have been the bee in a company that sells games, I can use them as tax write-offs.

12:21.780 --> 12:24.140
I'm writing off $900 worth of games this year.

12:24.140 --> 12:25.140
Lucky you.

12:25.140 --> 12:29.560
it in all right so me I I've just been enjoying old games I've been joining

12:29.560 --> 12:33.880
some of the greatest hits of 2005 I've been doing Animal Crossing and medio so

12:33.880 --> 12:38.920
I was actually got back into medios again and and this dude over here in the

12:38.920 --> 12:43.240
corner got me suckered back into World of Warcraft which I I was gonna cancel

12:43.240 --> 12:50.200
my account and then Mikolaj was like no you should come play on this server now

12:50.200 --> 12:54.000
I'm playing a horde character so it's it's interesting it's different than the

12:54.000 --> 12:58.320
alliance. I'll tell you what I'll do. What? I will go ahead and renew my World of Warcraft

12:58.320 --> 13:04.200
and I will play with you. Sweet! I'll make my zombie chick again. Sounds awesome. I'm

13:04.200 --> 13:09.480
playing a troll. I'm playing on Bronzebeard, my zombies on Bronzebeard. I don't want to

13:09.480 --> 13:13.280
say what server, but I'll let you know offline. I don't care because I haven't touched the

13:13.280 --> 13:18.680
game in three months, but I'll play again if you're playing. Alright, we can work something

13:18.680 --> 13:22.840
out. It'll be fun. So that's pretty much my gaming week. I've been driving around trying

13:22.840 --> 13:27.680
to find an Xbox 360 like crazy and still even in this you know how long has it

13:27.680 --> 13:31.920
been since Christmas like three weeks now two three weeks still cannot find an

13:31.920 --> 13:36.240
Xbox 360 I've been using that Best Buy locator thing we talked about a couple

13:36.240 --> 13:40.280
shows ago that you had in your live journal and I was just driving around a

13:40.280 --> 13:44.920
random places you would think I would Target, Walmart, Circuit City I mean no

13:44.920 --> 13:48.720
one shops at Circuit City anymore yet somebody's buying up all their Xbox 360

13:48.720 --> 13:51.400
at least in this area nobody shops at Circuit City it's it's a ghost town all

13:51.400 --> 13:56.280
the time, so. But no Xbox 360s. They told me they wouldn't have new one until February.

13:56.280 --> 13:58.120
That could be about right.

13:58.120 --> 14:02.840
I want to get my Geometry Wars on. This isn't fair. Damn you, Microsoft, for your supply

14:02.840 --> 14:04.320
shortage stuff.

14:04.320 --> 14:09.080
Well, here's the thing, and I was looking on Craigslist, and you know, their systems

14:09.080 --> 14:14.960
are obviously being sold over retail, but now that they are more out there, they aren't

14:14.960 --> 14:20.220
that expensive anymore. And like, for example, there'd be a core system and, or a premium

14:20.220 --> 14:25.260
system in a game and it was they were selling it for like, I want to say it was

14:25.260 --> 14:30.220
about $4.80 or something. It was like $20 more than it would have

14:30.220 --> 14:35.860
normally been. So I refuse to pay a penny over what the store would charge me on

14:35.860 --> 14:40.940
principle alone. I am not buying into that. When you think about tax it might actually come out to

14:40.940 --> 14:45.500
being about the same. I still refuse. I refuse to support the black market of

14:45.500 --> 14:53.060
Xbox is that I put my foot down no way it starts with me I and I urge everybody

14:53.060 --> 14:57.060
out there do not support the Xbox 360 black market you are continuing to rob

14:57.060 --> 15:01.260
people like me of an Xbox 360 because that's who's buying them as people who

15:01.260 --> 15:07.320
wants to put them on eBay and not that I can it's harder for me to get upset at

15:07.320 --> 15:10.280
the people that are buying them and putting them on eBay mostly because I

15:10.280 --> 15:16.000
know some people doing it even though I told them you make me cry it's it's if

15:16.000 --> 15:19.880
people weren't buying them and paying those hideous prices for them then there

15:19.880 --> 15:23.440
would be no point to selling them so I blame the buyers before I blame the

15:23.440 --> 15:29.480
sellers but the sellers are not you know free of blame here but I blame the

15:29.480 --> 15:34.920
buyers primarily anyway so that's pretty much my gaming week is is angst full of

15:34.920 --> 15:39.000
angst lack of Xbox 360 angst Miklotov since you're here tell us about your

15:39.000 --> 15:46.360
gaming week well this week I finally passed 1,000 wins on Mario Kart DS right

15:46.360 --> 15:51.120
on that's all we do at work on breaks let's play Mario Kart DS so it's pretty

15:51.120 --> 15:56.840
nice other than that I sold Animal Crossing because I don't have time for

15:56.840 --> 15:59.680
it because I have Mario Kart yeah because you're too busy with Mario Kart

15:59.680 --> 16:04.520
yeah and I started playing World of Warcraft again and City of Heroes and

16:04.520 --> 16:06.520
from fantasy 11

16:06.760 --> 16:08.680
I'm a big nerd

16:08.680 --> 16:10.240
That's all I do

16:10.240 --> 16:17.440
Now the listeners would kick my ass because you work for Konami and I know you have all these non disclosure agreements and stuff

16:17.440 --> 16:21.320
but I have to ask we're gonna talk about this a little more in depth later in the show, but

16:22.220 --> 16:28.600
Surely you have something you can say on DDR supernova. It's totally a DDR game. That's for the arcades

16:28.600 --> 16:34.700
Bet you didn't know that!

16:34.700 --> 16:36.860
In other words, he ain't budgin'.

16:36.860 --> 16:41.060
We're gonna have to get somebody from the higher ups in Konami and Guerrilla here on

16:41.060 --> 16:44.420
this show to figure out the details on what's going on with Supernova.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.380
We'll talk more about DDR Supernova.

16:46.380 --> 16:51.400
I imagine most people, or a lot of people listening to this show probably started on

16:51.400 --> 16:53.740
our music stuff so they know we're really excited.

16:53.740 --> 16:58.200
You know there was a lot of interesting talk in like our forums and our LJ community, Live

16:58.200 --> 17:04.180
Journal about isn't it ironic that the the week after Orange Lounge says we're

17:04.180 --> 17:10.200
not gonna do the Bahmani stuff anymore suddenly do we've got a brand new DDR

17:10.200 --> 17:16.440
game in arcades I don't it's not like we're gonna stop talking about Bahmani

17:16.440 --> 17:20.360
and music based games at all cuz they're still really important obviously we

17:20.360 --> 17:23.440
still really love them a lot we just don't want to only talk about that

17:23.440 --> 17:29.360
anymore so anyway there is more to life than to DDR there is there is we're

17:29.360 --> 17:32.640
gaming fans first music game fans second so that's that's an important thing to

17:32.640 --> 17:36.760
remember anyway um before we get into tonight's news we want to say a big

17:36.760 --> 17:41.480
special extra hugs and thank yous to MIDI head speaking of DDR MIDI had

17:41.480 --> 17:46.160
created songs you know he's been a musician for a while and does stuff for

17:46.160 --> 17:50.060
TV and movies it's pretty cool but he also did some songs that turn out in

17:50.060 --> 17:54.160
DDR and some remixes. He also did our brand new intro you heard tonight. So that was very

17:54.160 --> 17:55.720
nice of him to do that.

17:55.720 --> 17:56.720
I like it a whole lot.

17:56.720 --> 18:01.520
It was awesome. So if you want more information on his music, you like that little stuff we

18:01.520 --> 18:05.760
had in the beginning. Midihead.com is his website with more information. So it's pretty

18:05.760 --> 18:06.760
cool.

18:06.760 --> 18:12.400
Anyway, let's get into some gaming news tonight. Loki, what's going on with the Xbox 360? Speaking

18:12.400 --> 18:17.440
of how I can't find one, and they had these sales goals and all this stuff, what's up

18:17.440 --> 18:18.440
with this?

18:18.440 --> 18:25.400
First off, basically, it's just been a nightmare trying to find a 360 and that type of stuff,

18:25.400 --> 18:32.000
but right now they've sold about 600,000 units in the United States.

18:32.000 --> 18:38.000
Of course that's quite short to their original goal of 3 million in three months, being that

18:38.000 --> 18:42.080
we're on month two here, and 600,000.

18:42.080 --> 18:46.920
So yeah, they actually went back on their original announcement that they were going

18:46.920 --> 18:54.360
to do 3 million and now have kind of updated that to 5.5 to 6 million units by June 30th.

18:54.360 --> 18:58.760
So now it's kind of like, oh, we're just going to put the finish line further out there so

18:58.760 --> 19:00.360
we can sell more.

19:00.360 --> 19:04.180
I think the problem is are they going to make 3 million units in 90 years?

19:04.180 --> 19:06.360
Are they even going to be able to produce them?

19:06.360 --> 19:10.560
Well the problem was before and the whole thing that kind of delayed stuff was that

19:10.560 --> 19:16.640
they ran into the problem of course with the overheating GPUs and that type of thing and

19:16.640 --> 19:21.960
And because of that they've had to do more quality control and kind of just basically

19:21.960 --> 19:23.440
slow down the whole process.

19:23.440 --> 19:29.520
Now they've added another manufacturing plant and they've kind of ironed out this overheating

19:29.520 --> 19:33.340
issue so hopefully they're going to be up to speed.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.720
I still don't think they're going to make their goal though.

19:35.720 --> 19:39.980
Not by a long shot.

19:39.980 --> 19:42.960
So how many of these things have they actually sold since the launch?

19:42.960 --> 19:45.960
As I said, 600,000 so far estimated.

19:45.960 --> 19:51.720
Now there are other sources saying 1.3 million, I'm going to go with the 600,000 though.

19:51.720 --> 19:52.720
Alright.

19:52.720 --> 19:57.080
Lowball it, that way you don't get disappointed.

19:57.080 --> 19:58.080
Exactly.

19:58.080 --> 19:59.080
Alright.

19:59.080 --> 20:03.000
Moving on in the news, you might have heard this week that Tetris DS was kind of a surprise

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
announcement.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.360
Tetris is going to be coming out for the Nintendo DS.

20:06.360 --> 20:11.340
It's going to be coming out at the end of March, and it's going to support up to 10

20:11.340 --> 20:16.560
multiplayer if you're all in the same room for player Wi-Fi so that's still

20:16.560 --> 20:20.460
kind of cool they're taking Tetris Wi-Fi and also they're gonna be

20:20.460 --> 20:24.800
incorporating old 8-bit Nintendo classics into this somehow if you see

20:24.800 --> 20:28.440
the early screenshots you can see like Mario Brothers and some things like that

20:28.440 --> 20:31.360
in this early screenshot so it's very interesting because we don't know yet

20:31.360 --> 20:34.840
exactly how that works but we assume it has something to do with maybe the

20:34.840 --> 20:39.520
battle setup or something like that so I don't know if it's just me but I'm

20:39.520 --> 20:42.340
really excited about this but of course I'm a big puzzle game whore to begin

20:42.340 --> 20:47.880
with so finally having Tetris on the DS is pretty cool to me no I don't I don't

20:47.880 --> 20:53.600
think it's good why because four player ruin Mario Kart online four player will

20:53.600 --> 20:57.800
ruin Tetris wait wait wait this coming from the guy who just probably proclaimed

20:57.800 --> 21:02.440
a thousand wins okay but that's not online online mode for Mario Kart DS is

21:02.440 --> 21:07.800
really stupid because one it's hard to find four players sometimes and two if

21:07.800 --> 21:11.800
somebody doesn't get first they turn off their system and so then you're down to

21:11.800 --> 21:15.960
three or two or then just finally one I like the the wireless connection around

21:15.960 --> 21:22.560
with the people near you but the online mode is just absolutely crap I actually

21:22.560 --> 21:26.920
beg to differ I knew tons of people who played tetranet do we remember tetranet

21:26.920 --> 21:30.240
that was exactly what I thought of when I saw this is I was like oh my gosh it's

21:30.240 --> 21:34.680
tetranet with the item usage and everything it's not the fact that it's

21:34.680 --> 21:37.880
online so that they're limiting it to four players. That's my problem.

21:37.880 --> 21:40.920
But wasn't Tetranet 6 limited to six or four?

21:40.920 --> 21:44.280
I wanna... it's been so long since I played Tetranet. I know it was more than four,

21:44.280 --> 21:47.000
but I want to say it was like five or six was the most that you could have.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.440
That's still not much more than four.

21:49.320 --> 21:52.200
No. Well, Ru and Mario Kart, I just don't have high hopes for Tetris.

21:52.200 --> 21:55.480
Well, wait a minute then. If you're into this local area gaming thing,

21:56.440 --> 21:57.640
doesn't the 10 player...

21:57.640 --> 22:01.800
Yeah, that's cool. That's cool. I'm just... I'm sad that Nintendo has to go and

22:01.800 --> 22:05.480
either limitations on their software or whatever make it for players

22:05.480 --> 22:08.600
if I just have bad experiences with Mario Kart online so

22:08.600 --> 22:11.480
it's probably the network but do you think do you think Tetris is going to

22:11.480 --> 22:14.040
suffer from the same problem where people turn off their ds's if they lose

22:14.040 --> 22:18.520
too quick and then you have connection error probably you know there

22:18.520 --> 22:20.680
are some people that are just that competitive

22:20.680 --> 22:24.040
and if they lose they don't want it to count against their record haven't I

22:24.040 --> 22:28.680
bought in this game before like six seven times already stop making

22:28.680 --> 22:33.960
Tetris it was it's the same damn game they haven't improved anything at all

22:33.960 --> 22:42.440
and it's it's almost the perfect game Tetris is like crack what are you gonna

22:42.440 --> 22:46.240
get into a room with ten people wanting to play Tetris at the same time anime

22:46.240 --> 22:54.940
conventions yes I guarantee that or no oh no get this you imagine being on an

22:54.940 --> 22:59.140
airplane you're bored to death and random other people are playing Tetris

22:59.140 --> 23:02.020
and you can play Tetris with them and then the plane crashes because you're

23:02.020 --> 23:06.540
not supposed to play those wireless things actually yes you can oh yeah

23:06.540 --> 23:08.980
that's right when you're in the air you can when you once you're in the air you

23:08.980 --> 23:12.620
can do it that's right yeah it's totally true the fourth time I saw Brokeback

23:12.620 --> 23:16.740
Mountain we took our DS's into in the theater and there are people playing

23:16.740 --> 23:19.340
Mario Kart so we played Mario Kart during the previews with people in the

23:19.340 --> 23:23.380
theater so Tetris really could work just randomly anywhere imagine like a big

23:23.380 --> 23:25.660
sports game or a concert I bet it's the same deal

23:25.660 --> 23:29.940
I've done pictochat standing in line. I've seen lots of people do that too

23:29.940 --> 23:34.260
I mean it's crazy. The last time I did the massive pictochat where there was a lot of

23:34.260 --> 23:35.220
other people was

23:35.220 --> 23:39.620
E3. I did pictochat at E3 standing in the line to play

23:39.620 --> 23:45.060
Nintendo. I was doing it in the line waiting to get in and I remember seeing

23:45.060 --> 23:45.540
this

23:45.540 --> 23:49.900
all these people writing on their pictochats OMG it's Gary Coleman OMG OMG

23:49.900 --> 23:53.520
and then I look to my right and sure enough Gary Coleman standing like right

23:53.520 --> 23:54.580
there I'm like oh

23:54.580 --> 23:58.880
OMG it really is him. It's just kinda funny. I was doing picture chat and saw a familiar

23:58.880 --> 24:00.460
name looked up and it was a

24:00.460 --> 24:04.020
Sharks Girl. She was

24:04.020 --> 24:09.160
in the other line next to me. Networking through Nintendo DS. Gotta love it.

24:09.160 --> 24:12.420
I'm sorry but like they have the Tetris Grandmaster

24:12.420 --> 24:17.420
or whatever ace that came out in the 360. It's one of the launch titles in Japan.

24:17.420 --> 24:24.420
Lame. Lame. Yes, let's show our next-gen power by putting out Tetris.

24:26.020 --> 24:30.900
Now wait a minute, though. Tetris also launched the Game Boy and was the launch title of the

24:30.900 --> 24:32.820
most successful system of all time.

24:32.820 --> 24:39.260
Okay, that's it. No more Tetris for any next-gen consoles ever. Sony, hear me out. No more

24:39.260 --> 24:43.440
Tetris. No Tetris on your system. If they come up to you and say, we want to make Tetris

24:43.440 --> 24:46.780
for your system, you say, no, I will not have this crap on my system.

24:46.780 --> 24:49.980
More Tetris! Bring us Tengen Tetris!

24:49.980 --> 24:53.080
Wait, remember the Tetris on the PlayStation?

24:53.080 --> 24:55.480
It sucked, because they changed the formula.

24:55.480 --> 24:59.480
Instead of just being the little blocks, they had the little guy that would climb on the blocks,

24:59.480 --> 25:00.980
and, like, you weren't supposed to kill him or something.

25:00.980 --> 25:02.280
It was so stupid!

25:02.280 --> 25:03.980
That was what, Tetris Worlds?

25:03.980 --> 25:06.680
I don't remember what it was. Tetris Suck, that's what I call it.

25:06.680 --> 25:09.880
Who remembers Blastris?

25:09.880 --> 25:10.380
Nobody.

25:10.380 --> 25:12.080
With the Super Scope 6.

25:12.080 --> 25:15.280
Oh, that one. The Super Scope 6 game, yeah, I remember that one.

25:15.280 --> 25:17.560
I played the hell out of Blastress.

25:17.560 --> 25:19.240
Who remembers Hatress?

25:19.240 --> 25:20.240
I remember Hatress.

25:20.240 --> 25:21.240
Word, dude.

25:21.240 --> 25:22.240
Word-tress?

25:22.240 --> 25:23.240
What about Tetrisphere?

25:23.240 --> 25:24.240
That was awesome.

25:24.240 --> 25:26.080
Tetris 2 Bomb Bliss?

25:26.080 --> 25:28.120
Yeah, I remember that.

25:28.120 --> 25:30.040
They all sucked compared to the original.

25:30.040 --> 25:31.840
Hey, Tetrisphere was awesome.

25:31.840 --> 25:34.600
It's all about cooperative mode on Tang and Tetris.

25:34.600 --> 25:35.800
All right.

25:35.800 --> 25:37.200
Tang and Tetris.

25:37.200 --> 25:41.840
Now, Loki, I find it ironic that you're talking about Tetris on the Sony platform because

25:41.840 --> 25:46.120
Didn't you say something to me before the show about Tetris being on the PSP?

25:46.120 --> 25:47.120
What's this about?

25:47.120 --> 25:50.920
Okay, well the first game, of course, that they're going to port using that stupid Grand

25:50.920 --> 25:53.920
Theft Auto hack around, you know, is, you know...

25:53.920 --> 25:54.920
No, wait, I don't know.

25:54.920 --> 25:56.720
Tell me about the Grand Theft Auto hack.

25:56.720 --> 26:02.000
Anyways, no, there is this Grand Theft Auto cheat device that was created by this guy

26:02.000 --> 26:10.480
named, I believe it was Edson Carter or something like that, anyways, long story short, it's

26:10.480 --> 26:14.960
this wonderful device that you can, you know, load all these cheats and basically a trainer

26:14.960 --> 26:22.800
for Grand Theft Auto. Well, now they're using this to port homebrew to the PSP for firmwares

26:22.800 --> 26:28.800
2.5, 2.6, and so on. So, actually, that's what they're doing. The first game that's

26:28.800 --> 26:36.740
been released right now is Tetris for version 2.5 Y people, because it's a ridiculously

26:36.740 --> 26:43.100
simple concept, but yet an addicting game that people want to play. Everybody. People

26:43.100 --> 26:48.260
that don't play games play Tetris. You know what I mean? It's just like when I go around

26:48.260 --> 26:52.280
at work and I'm watching unproductive people. What are they doing? They're playing Bejeweled.

26:52.280 --> 26:56.600
They're playing those really simple games that you can get into. People that wouldn't

26:56.600 --> 27:00.300
be the types that buy Xboxes or PS2s. They get on PopCap and play all those little...

27:00.300 --> 27:06.340
Okay. Well, we have to thank, though, Edison Carter for creating the wonderful cheat device.

27:06.340 --> 27:10.660
Now however, one of the things they have done beyond Tetris is they've released a software

27:10.660 --> 27:14.660
development kit that they're using to pour other homebrew over, so you're going to see

27:14.660 --> 27:19.220
a lot more stuff coming and possibly another downgrader later on.

27:19.220 --> 27:21.700
Alright, well we'll see what happens.

27:21.700 --> 27:24.020
Alright, let's shift gears here a little bit.

27:24.020 --> 27:27.780
Some folks say that Tetris is a bit of an educational game in some ways because it's

27:27.780 --> 27:28.780
a puzzle game.

27:28.780 --> 27:30.260
You've got to think through it a little bit.

27:30.260 --> 27:31.260
Jamie, you're making a face.

27:31.260 --> 27:32.260
Why are you making a face?

27:32.260 --> 27:33.260
Tetris is educational, my butt!

27:33.260 --> 27:35.760
Tetris is educational, my butt!

27:35.760 --> 27:37.260
It's a thinking game!

27:37.260 --> 27:39.760
It's the kind of game that your teachers don't get mad you're playing.

27:39.760 --> 27:41.760
Tetris is a game of instinct.

27:41.760 --> 27:42.760
Uh-uh.

27:42.760 --> 27:44.260
You get up to like...

27:44.260 --> 27:48.260
I would play Tetris from like 1 to 18 to 20.

27:48.260 --> 27:50.760
Dr. Mario is the same damn way.

27:50.760 --> 27:54.760
It's thinking fast and instinct.

27:54.760 --> 27:57.260
It's speed thoughts.

27:57.260 --> 27:58.760
Speed practice.

27:58.760 --> 28:00.760
When I was in junior high school,

28:00.760 --> 28:05.580
The only, we used to sometimes, because we were such nerds, we would break in our science

28:05.580 --> 28:09.460
teacher's classroom and play on the computers, and the only times that we would get our teacher

28:09.460 --> 28:14.460
in on it is when we were playing Tetris or Scorched Earth.

28:14.460 --> 28:21.060
You know, I had, when I was in the writing class I had to take in college, we actually

28:21.060 --> 28:27.080
had those old Macs, like the, not the two E's, but you know what I mean, the old box

28:27.080 --> 28:33.300
crap ones and my friend installed Tetris on hers during class and I was playing

28:33.300 --> 28:42.300
Doom in black and white on a Mac all right anyway education yes well there's

28:42.300 --> 28:47.580
a little article up on 1up.com called you can't be serious five famous

28:47.580 --> 28:51.940
designers rehabilitate the world's most boring games but I thought wouldn't it

28:51.940 --> 28:56.300
be more interesting since we are actually more celebrity than those

28:56.300 --> 29:02.460
losers. Wow! Wow, I see the hate mail coming in already. No, no, no, no, no, I'm joking.

29:02.460 --> 29:06.060
I have friends over there, be careful. There's some pretty cool people involved in that,

29:06.060 --> 29:10.100
like they got some of the folks who worked on Ratchet and Clank and different people,

29:10.100 --> 29:16.580
but I think we should do our take on it. Okay, give me an example. First game, Virtual Leader.

29:16.580 --> 29:21.820
It works as a staff meeting without donuts, but it teaches managers how to, I like this,

29:21.820 --> 29:28.020
I'm gonna quote this how to squash the hopes and dreams of worker bees, but actually you learn how to keep them productive

29:28.020 --> 29:31.320
It's sort of I like the comparison the sims meet office space. I

29:32.980 --> 29:37.740
So in the sense that what this article has is it's got famous game designers saying this is an edutainment game

29:37.740 --> 29:39.800
They're obvious. This is how we would remake it

29:39.800 --> 29:44.580
I I think there should be because you know what high school isn't just about learning like book learning

29:44.580 --> 29:48.660
It's about social learning too. So I think there should be a game called

29:48.660 --> 29:53.860
called, um, um, Murder the Bully. No, I'm just teasing, don't do that kids, please don't,

29:53.860 --> 29:54.860
but...

29:54.860 --> 29:58.740
Well, um, it says in here, though, to rehabilitate this one, this is by Ted Price, who's the,

29:58.740 --> 30:04.140
uh, president, uh, of Insomniac, who did Wretched and Clank. Um, said first all the employees

30:04.140 --> 30:09.620
in the games would be armed, concealed or visible, and then have full body armor, and

30:09.620 --> 30:14.180
you can, like, shoot your boss for yelling at you, I think. Uh, you know, each employee

30:14.180 --> 30:19.540
should have a unique psychosis I think that would be cool but my take on that

30:19.540 --> 30:23.780
would be you would have like your mole employee who's actually working for

30:23.780 --> 30:28.260
another company working on a hostile takeover and by hostile I mean bazookas

30:28.260 --> 30:32.220
okay I got a great game based on an earlier job I had this is my game this

30:32.220 --> 30:37.780
is my adventure of a game okay it's called data entry monkey the game okay

30:37.780 --> 30:42.460
and what you have to do is you have to turn on your let's say it's for Xbox

30:42.460 --> 30:46.540
because Xboxes have a clock in it I know that so let's say that you turn on your

30:46.540 --> 30:50.500
Xbox and you have to be in by eight o'clock or the Xbox yells at you and

30:50.500 --> 30:54.700
threatens to fire you okay and then what happens is that a sequence of like up

30:54.700 --> 30:58.540
down left right and ABYX come up on the screen and you have to punch them in

30:58.540 --> 31:02.980
with 98% accuracy for eight freaking hours with 30-minute lunch and two

31:02.980 --> 31:07.860
15-minute breaks and then when it's done that's it end of game and it prepares

31:07.860 --> 31:13.680
you for your first office job of data entry monkey there actually is a yahoo

31:13.680 --> 31:17.940
game where you serve customers and take orders really like root beer times I

31:17.940 --> 31:25.820
seen I've watched iguana girl playing this she's amazingly good at it but the

31:25.820 --> 31:30.060
next game come is called a force more powerful which is a pacifist game it's

31:30.060 --> 31:33.780
an anti-war game where you have military situations come up and you have to find

31:33.780 --> 31:36.860
a non-violent solution to them.

31:36.860 --> 31:39.840
That right away just sounds really boring because, you know, the whole world just wants

31:39.840 --> 31:42.020
to blow the crap out of each other.

31:42.020 --> 31:54.340
So there's a, they talk in here about having a, it's by the manager who oversaw Perfect

31:54.340 --> 31:57.140
Dark Zero, which I find this hilarious.

31:57.140 --> 32:00.620
I'm curious what you guys in chat, who are listening to us live, what did you guys think

32:00.620 --> 32:01.620
in chat room now?

32:01.620 --> 32:03.620
I want to hear some good ideas.

32:03.620 --> 32:06.740
www.orangeloungeradio.com

32:06.740 --> 32:10.060
It's the first show people. Click on interact with us.

32:10.060 --> 32:13.800
It's not the first show, this is number 170. Yeah, but I keep

32:13.800 --> 32:16.780
blaming it on the first show thing.

32:16.780 --> 32:19.820
But is it like doing a country simulator with

32:19.820 --> 32:24.260
intelligent AIs that you have to convince them? I think the game's already been done.

32:24.260 --> 32:28.300
You know, isn't that like Actraiser or some shit?

32:28.300 --> 32:33.100
Maybe, I'm not sure. But, you know, the way I would do that is I would just not,

32:33.100 --> 32:37.920
You know, I would not make a game out of that. I would actually do it in real life

32:39.580 --> 32:42.480
The only way to go outside the game

32:43.300 --> 32:47.620
Exactly go outside the game be active in react in real life and stop pretending

32:48.100 --> 32:50.500
But I don't I don't think that would be very good game at all

32:50.660 --> 32:52.860
We have some feedback in the chat room from Tomo kun

32:52.860 --> 32:55.940
There was a game at the McDonald's website where you went through a day at work

32:56.140 --> 33:00.300
Just clicking over and over and producing Big Macs. I saw that a couple years ago

33:00.300 --> 33:05.600
Yeah, but does the game shoot hot grease at you so you can really get the full experience

33:05.600 --> 33:06.600
of what it's like?

33:06.600 --> 33:07.600
I don't think so.

33:07.600 --> 33:08.600
It glamorizes it.

33:08.600 --> 33:14.640
Does it not, you know, um, penalize you for making really bad burgers or messing up completely?

33:14.640 --> 33:16.040
Oh, I forgot the patty!

33:16.040 --> 33:17.040
That's okay.

33:17.040 --> 33:18.040
Close enough.

33:18.040 --> 33:23.000
Another game on here is called Virtual You, and I'll just go ahead and read this.

33:23.000 --> 33:28.200
Um, basically you have to either, you know, keep your professors happy and keep the football

33:28.200 --> 33:34.400
team off steroids and keep the you know the frat boy issues from happening you

33:34.400 --> 33:39.720
know like hazing and stuff so you are being a university administrator and

33:39.720 --> 33:45.520
teaching you the administrative process if they wanted that to be really

33:45.520 --> 33:49.840
realistic though the educators would have to be on both like some type of

33:49.840 --> 33:56.000
like coffee and then lots of booze and be highly alcoholic and have an ulcer

33:56.000 --> 34:02.420
They should actually have a school administrator health where you have to

34:02.420 --> 34:05.840
monitor your vitals and manage the school while keeping yourself from dying.

34:05.840 --> 34:11.140
Is that like trauma center? I don't know. Anyway, well it'll be interesting to see

34:11.140 --> 34:15.020
what kind of edutainment titles appear from maybe some of these minds or other

34:15.020 --> 34:19.360
people in the next few years. I'm kind of curious really quick though, what

34:19.360 --> 34:23.000
would you say were some educational games? On a serious note, educational games

34:23.000 --> 34:27.900
that had a long-lasting impact on you like ones that you remember and I'm

34:27.900 --> 34:31.520
gonna get one right here because I know we'd all say it the Oregon Trail right

34:31.520 --> 34:35.460
we all remember the Oregon Trail you lived out of dysentery exactly that you

34:35.460 --> 34:40.620
cannot for the river no matter how hard you try or somebody's gonna drown what

34:40.620 --> 34:44.420
are some games you remember from edutainment days where in the world is

34:44.420 --> 34:48.020
Carmen Sandiego which I was always really good at that because I just was

34:48.020 --> 34:51.960
good at history and actually where in time was mine where in time was my

34:51.960 --> 34:54.560
freaking game cuz I caught Carmen Sandiego.

34:54.560 --> 34:58.520
I had to play on the slower sk- I- I- I did, uh, Where in the USA. I had to keep it local.

34:58.520 --> 35:02.360
A- A Number of Munchers was the one I remember.

35:02.360 --> 35:06.920
Remember Number of Munchers? Mario was missing. Remember how people thought that was actually a

35:06.920 --> 35:07.720
Mario game?

35:07.720 --> 35:11.480
I rented it one time. It had really good music. I had the MP3.

35:11.480 --> 35:15.000
Well, you know- you know what the one good thing about that game was, though, is that it was

35:15.000 --> 35:18.440
basically all of the Super Nintendo graphics on a Nintendo.

35:18.440 --> 35:24.040
from Mario World. I remember that. And it looked really good. I was like, they put this

35:24.040 --> 35:27.400
effort into this game? Excuse me? I remember that.

35:27.400 --> 35:32.240
I remember that. Alright, well, moving on. Oh, actually another educational game. Sure, what?

35:32.240 --> 35:32.880
Ridge Racer.

35:32.880 --> 35:38.640
How is that educational? It taught me how to drive. I'm serious!

35:38.640 --> 35:42.480
That's, that's like how my mom said everything I needed to learn about the

35:42.480 --> 35:45.480
birds and the bees, so to speak. I learned from married with children.

35:45.480 --> 35:55.120
Now, Jamie, you have a follow-up story here about teachers in the UK supporting games

35:55.120 --> 35:56.600
in education?

35:56.600 --> 36:09.080
Right, there's a project called Teaching with Games, EA and Nesta Future Labs, excuse me

36:09.080 --> 36:13.740
if I can breathe today, revealed that 60% of UK educators are supporting using video

36:13.740 --> 36:19.500
games in education. There's a survey that was conducted in November that covered a

36:19.500 --> 36:23.940
thousand primary and secondary school teachers in the UK and of the 59% who

36:23.940 --> 36:28.700
considered using games in education, 53% confirmed they would do so because they

36:28.700 --> 36:35.660
are an interactive way of motivating and engaging pupils. 91% believed that

36:35.660 --> 36:40.420
playing the games could develop children's motor cognitive skills. Over

36:40.420 --> 36:44.840
60% thought that players would develop their higher-order thinking and would also acquire

36:44.840 --> 36:46.840
topic-specific knowledge.

36:46.840 --> 36:52.720
Now I actually, about two months ago, brought up an article I read in one of the psychology

36:52.720 --> 36:58.500
journals that I occasionally read, because I'm a nerd, that was talking about how they

36:58.500 --> 37:05.780
actually did lab study tests with control groups to pit the cognitive function of gamers

37:05.780 --> 37:10.460
versus non-gamers, and that the gamers came up higher in almost anything having to do

37:10.460 --> 37:14.020
with a reactive cognitive type of activity.

37:14.020 --> 37:18.520
So in other words, when we tell our parents that we're working on our hand-eye coordination,

37:18.520 --> 37:19.740
we ain't shittin' ya.

37:19.740 --> 37:20.740
It's actually true.

37:20.740 --> 37:25.380
I mean, cause the thing is, especially since there are so many different types of games,

37:25.380 --> 37:29.340
you have your puzzle games that basically are teaching you spatial relations right then,

37:29.340 --> 37:30.640
and they're Tetris, okay?

37:30.640 --> 37:31.820
Back to Tetris.

37:31.820 --> 37:36.900
You have your games that are teaching you how to basically come to a conclusion, the

37:36.900 --> 37:39.500
logic process.

37:39.500 --> 37:45.760
You have your games that are teaching you basically how a sport will go or teaching

37:45.760 --> 37:48.220
you how to play a game.

37:48.220 --> 37:51.620
You understand more of the mechanics behind some of these things, especially with as interactive

37:51.620 --> 37:53.720
as sports games are becoming.

37:53.720 --> 37:56.940
You really have to know quite a bit.

37:56.940 --> 38:01.100
And I think that, I think it's actually really terrific and I wish that, you know, instead

38:01.100 --> 38:07.300
of our, you know, nemesis Mr. Thompson going around saying that games are teaching people

38:07.300 --> 38:08.300
how to kill.

38:08.300 --> 38:09.300
We're so-

38:09.300 --> 38:10.300
What was the word this week?

38:10.300 --> 38:13.300
Masturbatory exercise or something?

38:13.300 --> 38:16.220
I'm trying not to be foul-mouthed in this episode.

38:16.220 --> 38:18.900
Yeah, don't get us that explicit tag on iTunes, please.

38:18.900 --> 38:19.900
But...

38:19.900 --> 38:20.900
Screw him.

38:20.900 --> 38:21.900
Alright.

38:21.900 --> 38:27.500
screw him all right um no I take that back because no one would want to they'd

38:27.500 --> 38:34.100
be afraid all right okay back back to the good stuff back to the good stuff I

38:34.100 --> 38:39.260
do though think that a lot with these people who may say games so much are

38:39.260 --> 38:45.860
overlooking the amount of good that there is and all that you know I agree

38:45.860 --> 38:49.060
I agree do you think it's realistic that someday in PE class we could have like

38:49.060 --> 38:51.820
video games that supplement the games we're about to play?

38:51.820 --> 38:55.180
Schools in Southern California have DDR as part of their gym program.

38:55.180 --> 38:58.100
Do you think like before we go out and play football for real, maybe learn a little bit

38:58.100 --> 39:00.820
about the strategy in Madden, possibly?

39:00.820 --> 39:04.980
You have to decide your plays, but that's been there since Tech Mobile.

39:04.980 --> 39:05.980
True.

39:05.980 --> 39:09.140
All right, let's change gears here a little bit.

39:09.140 --> 39:10.900
Very interesting discussion there on education.

39:10.900 --> 39:16.020
If you all ever have any feedback, togo at orangelawandtrader.com is the place to send

39:16.020 --> 39:17.020
us some emails.

39:17.020 --> 39:20.780
the mailbag a little bit later in the show but first we got the Duke from

39:20.780 --> 39:23.860
Freeze Pop waiting so we want to get to him but we got a couple stories first so

39:23.860 --> 39:28.700
Loki, what's going on with DirecTV on the Xbox 360?

39:28.700 --> 39:34.020
Well, the 360 of course they wanted to be the entertainment console for you

39:34.020 --> 39:37.260
and basically all-encompassing and everything.

39:37.260 --> 39:40.580
Which I think everybody wants in this next gen of game.

39:40.580 --> 39:45.580
I want some for $400 seriously but what they're doing right now

39:45.580 --> 39:52.900
DirectTV has actually announced that they are planning to bring their service to digital

39:52.900 --> 39:57.860
televisions via PC's and the Xbox 360 system.

39:57.860 --> 40:04.320
This will basically make it a lot easier to turn PC's into DVR's as well as making the

40:04.320 --> 40:10.340
Xbox 360 awesome, because now we can record TV to it.

40:10.340 --> 40:14.140
How this is going to be implemented, I don't know, but it sounds cool.

40:14.140 --> 40:15.300
I'm all for it.

40:15.300 --> 40:16.300
It's interesting.

40:16.300 --> 40:17.300
Okay, why not?

40:17.300 --> 40:18.300
Why not?

40:18.300 --> 40:22.300
I mean, you've got a hard drive in there, granted it's not big.

40:22.300 --> 40:26.820
I guess anything to reach out to get that Xbox 360 to be the centerpiece in your living

40:26.820 --> 40:29.400
room was a good idea for Microsoft, right?

40:29.400 --> 40:33.980
It's great that they're adding all this extra functionality to it.

40:33.980 --> 40:37.300
Just when are they going to start making better games?

40:37.300 --> 40:41.360
So I thought it was a gaming system.

40:41.360 --> 40:46.080
One thing, though, that you will not be watching on DirecTV is Judgment Day, right, Loki?

40:46.080 --> 40:52.080
Yeah, Judgment Day is gone, yet another show that bites the dust on G4 TV.

40:52.080 --> 40:57.780
Judgment Day is the one with Tommy Tallarico and Victor Lucas, right, doing a little, like,

40:57.780 --> 40:59.800
you know, I like this game and I don't like this game.

40:59.800 --> 41:04.920
Well the thing is, and I'm not sure, I'm guessing just G4 canceled it because it's one of the

41:04.920 --> 41:05.920
shows that...

41:05.920 --> 41:06.920
Well, because they don't like gaming anymore, except for X-Lay.

41:06.920 --> 41:07.920
Yeah, exactly.

41:07.920 --> 41:14.980
One of the things is, basically the show will still kind of exist in this, it's an ongoing

41:14.980 --> 41:19.140
show they have, they do three shows, Electric Playground, Reviews on the Run, and then Judgment

41:19.140 --> 41:24.220
Day, Judgment Day being gone, but Reviews on the Run is kind of very similar to Judgment

41:24.220 --> 41:28.200
Day anyway, so, you know, it's not really gone.

41:28.200 --> 41:30.960
Of course Reviews on the Run, you're not going to see it if you're in the United States,

41:30.960 --> 41:34.080
they don't play it in the United States on G4 or anything like that.

41:34.080 --> 41:38.040
I'm surprised these guys haven't gotten into the world of video podcasting yet with their stuff.

41:38.040 --> 41:41.920
Well, I'm not sure if... I mean, they're still doing Electric Playground, so...

41:41.920 --> 41:45.760
Take X-Play on, head-to-head! Although I prefer X-Play, personally, because it's funny, but...

41:45.760 --> 41:49.120
Electric Playground's still an okay show, but you know what?

41:49.120 --> 41:54.840
That's okay, I like it. You know what? They cancel one show, it's so easy to cancel another one, so...

41:54.840 --> 42:00.400
You know, I'm sure they'll just replace it with reruns of Thunder in Paradise or something like that.

42:00.400 --> 42:03.200
I'm going to be nice. I'm going to be nice.

42:03.200 --> 42:06.200
Coming to G4 TV, Paradise Hotel Radio.

42:06.200 --> 42:11.200
Because I guarantee you I have some pretty choice things to say about G4, so I'm going to be nice and not say it.

42:12.200 --> 42:15.200
If you can't say something nice, then shut up.

42:15.200 --> 42:16.200
There you go.

42:16.200 --> 42:18.200
Alright, anyway.

42:18.200 --> 42:22.200
Tonight on Orange Lounge Radio, we are welcoming a very special guest.

42:22.200 --> 42:29.200
I remember the first time I played the music game Frequency, and we played the song Science Genius Girl by the band Freezepop.

42:29.200 --> 42:32.200
I totally fell in love with its synth sounds and 80's hook.

42:32.200 --> 42:33.200
I wasn't alone.

42:33.200 --> 42:36.240
I would say all of us here at Orange Lounge Radio, along with many of you out there in

42:36.240 --> 42:39.560
the gaming world, demanded more freeze pop.

42:39.560 --> 42:43.760
Thanks to a relationship with the gaming group Harmonics, freeze pop continued to rock us

42:43.760 --> 42:48.920
with songs in Amplitude, Karaoke Revolution, and now recently crossed over into mainstream

42:48.920 --> 42:52.400
hits such as Dance Dance Revolution and Guitar Hero.

42:52.400 --> 42:56.800
Now Jamie, I know you are the queen of Orange Lounge Radio, but what do you think?

42:56.800 --> 42:58.960
Should we invite some other royalty here on the show?

42:58.960 --> 42:59.960
Sure.

42:59.960 --> 43:01.800
Like the Duke from the band Freeze Pop?

43:01.800 --> 43:02.800
Cool.

43:02.800 --> 43:07.480
All right, please help me welcome to Orange Lounge Radio, the Duke from Freezepop.

43:07.480 --> 43:08.480
How you doing?

43:08.480 --> 43:09.480
Great.

43:09.480 --> 43:11.160
How's everybody out there doing?

43:11.160 --> 43:12.160
Pretty good.

43:12.160 --> 43:15.420
We're pretty excited here because we're having our brand new format tonight.

43:15.420 --> 43:17.120
It's a pretty big week for us.

43:17.120 --> 43:18.120
Great.

43:18.120 --> 43:22.460
Now, I know you've been kind of doing a little bit of touring with Freezepop lately.

43:22.460 --> 43:25.440
You guys were at the GAME Festival in San Francisco.

43:25.440 --> 43:27.080
How did that go?

43:27.080 --> 43:28.080
That was pretty fun.

43:28.080 --> 43:32.720
We were out there just because the game developers conference was happening at that same time

43:32.720 --> 43:37.440
and so there's a bunch of video game related events out there and we wanted to play a show

43:37.440 --> 43:44.000
and we also played at the gang awards, which is the game audio network guild and at the

43:44.000 --> 43:45.720
game event at the Metreon.

43:45.720 --> 43:46.720
It was a lot of fun.

43:46.720 --> 43:47.720
Awesome.

43:47.720 --> 43:49.920
So it sounds like you guys do a lot of video game related events.

43:49.920 --> 43:52.800
Anything coming up?

43:52.800 --> 43:55.960
Actually nothing really tied to that.

43:55.960 --> 44:00.860
just like little one-off shows and weekends here in the US and then weíre going back

44:00.860 --> 44:04.900
over to England in April for a weekend with the show, so that should be fun.

44:04.900 --> 44:08.140
If people want to check out your upcoming tour dates, they can always visit your website

44:08.140 --> 44:09.780
or your MySpace, right?

44:09.780 --> 44:10.780
Yes, definitely.

44:10.780 --> 44:16.500
Our website is usually the most up-to-date and thatís just freezepop.com, so thatís

44:16.500 --> 44:19.300
right there on our news page.

44:19.300 --> 44:23.760
You mentioned there that you do a lot of work with these video game award shows and stuff.

44:23.760 --> 44:28.000
Of course, I think the way most people know about you guys is that your long-standing

44:28.000 --> 44:34.000
working relationship with harmonics, because seeing a synth band in Guitar Hero was a bit

44:34.000 --> 44:39.320
of a surprise, but not to anyone that played Amplitude or Frequency or any of those games.

44:39.320 --> 44:42.080
How did your relationship with harmonics begin?

44:42.080 --> 44:48.440
Do you want the real truth or do you want the fake story?

44:48.440 --> 44:50.920
We want the real deal here.

44:50.920 --> 44:53.080
The real deal is I work there.

44:53.080 --> 44:54.080
Wow!

44:54.080 --> 44:55.080
Okay.

44:55.080 --> 44:56.080
Okay.

44:56.080 --> 44:59.480
What's the fake story, just out of curiosity?

44:59.480 --> 45:01.880
I don't work there.

45:01.880 --> 45:02.880
Okay.

45:02.880 --> 45:03.880
Okay.

45:03.880 --> 45:10.300
Well, now, because you are working at Harmonix, Freezepop is not the only name you've done

45:10.300 --> 45:12.040
contributions under, right?

45:12.040 --> 45:13.760
No, that's true.

45:13.760 --> 45:20.180
For both frequency and amplitude, I was initially hired there basically just as an audio authoring

45:20.180 --> 45:22.080
person songwriter

45:22.080 --> 45:25.860
and uh... we knew that uh... we want to be able to get enough artists for the

45:25.860 --> 45:29.800
game to especially fill out a bunch of sub-genres that we really wanted to have

45:29.800 --> 45:31.120
in the game

45:31.120 --> 45:33.860
and so my job is basically to um...

45:33.860 --> 45:36.640
how to come up with all the different fault that kind of covered his honors

45:36.640 --> 45:39.280
we didn't have like synth-pop, drum and bass

45:39.280 --> 45:42.520
electro, techno, trance

45:42.520 --> 45:45.860
like those kind of genres. So I wrote a lot of music under kind of a

45:45.860 --> 45:48.620
some fake names for those different genres of music

45:48.620 --> 45:52.420
but it ended up working out really well because Freezepop has kind of taken off, right?

45:52.420 --> 45:57.020
Freezepop has gotten a lot of fans from video games.

45:57.020 --> 46:01.580
There's no denying that we basically reached a whole group of people that probably would

46:01.580 --> 46:04.660
never have heard of us if not through the games.

46:04.660 --> 46:06.660
That's awesome.

46:06.660 --> 46:11.240
This relationship that you have with Harmonix hasn't really gone unnoticed in the larger

46:11.240 --> 46:16.100
video game scene because you guys have contributed to this latest music game that came out this

46:16.100 --> 46:20.020
this fall, DDR UltraMix III.

46:20.020 --> 46:24.260
Is it true that you actually worked on a lot of the background music and ambient music

46:24.260 --> 46:25.260
in the game?

46:25.260 --> 46:26.260
Is that true?

46:26.260 --> 46:30.980
Yes, actually it was kind of a fun opportunity.

46:30.980 --> 46:36.700
I had been trying to get some free spot music into a DDR game for a while, and Harmonics

46:36.700 --> 46:41.500
has a long-standing relationship with Konami because we've made the Karaoke Revolution

46:41.500 --> 46:46.700
games for them, which there are now four of them out there.

46:46.700 --> 46:52.820
I think Science Genius Girls' freeze-pop song was in the first Karaoke Revolution.

46:52.820 --> 46:53.820
Douglas Goldstein, CFP®, is the director of Profile Investment Services and the host of

46:53.820 --> 46:59.220
So how did this relationship with Karaoke Revolution turn into being a part of Ultramix

46:59.220 --> 47:00.220
3?

47:00.220 --> 47:06.660
Well, it was basically like any industry, based on who you know.

47:06.660 --> 47:11.580
The people who helped the Karaoke Revolution thing finally helped me get in contact with

47:11.580 --> 47:16.100
the right people at Konami, and I got some music to them and started talking to them.

47:16.100 --> 47:21.060
They were excited about either putting an exclusive freeze-pop song or a remix.

47:21.060 --> 47:26.820
we couldn't figure out like what relationship or how we were going to spin things and so

47:26.820 --> 47:30.380
we kind of agreed that they really liked the song Stake Out and I kind of wanted to get

47:30.380 --> 47:36.300
them something exclusive that nobody else had and so I made the remix for them which

47:36.300 --> 47:42.060
I think you'll probably hear a little bit later on and then they approached me and said

47:42.060 --> 47:46.220
oh you know we really like your sound but kind of like the sound of the game is supposed

47:46.220 --> 47:50.120
to be really like bubbly and blippy and synth-poppy and we like the sound of freeze-pop do you

47:50.120 --> 47:54.880
You want to write some of the option screen music, and that's how it just kind of randomly

47:54.880 --> 47:55.880
happens.

47:55.880 --> 48:01.880
Awesome. Well, let's take a moment to hear from DDR UltraMix III, Stakeout, the UltraMix, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

48:25.880 --> 48:32.880
I think I'm ready

48:32.880 --> 48:39.880
Not feeling it, feeling it

48:39.880 --> 48:42.880
I need my time

48:42.880 --> 48:47.880
Yeah, I know that comes to me all

48:47.880 --> 49:03.760
Can't let you see me Can't let you see me

49:33.760 --> 49:46.680
All right, now the video for Stakeout, the UltraMix, is kind of very interesting as well.

49:46.680 --> 49:48.700
It's kind of like a flash animation video.

49:48.700 --> 49:51.320
How did the video come about for that song?

49:51.320 --> 49:57.440
That was actually done by our singer, Liz Enthusiasm, whose alter ego is actually as

49:57.440 --> 50:04.400
a web designer, an animator, and kind of like an all-around design guru.

50:04.400 --> 50:09.420
And she, a couple years ago, when Flash started to become really popular, just wanted to check

50:09.420 --> 50:10.420
it out.

50:10.420 --> 50:14.820
And I think she felt a good way to kind of get into using the program was to make some

50:14.820 --> 50:15.820
videos for us.

50:15.820 --> 50:20.760
So she made a video for our song, Freeze Pop Forever, and then she also made the Stakeout

50:20.760 --> 50:21.760
video for us.

50:21.760 --> 50:22.760
Awesome.

50:22.760 --> 50:25.360
Well, the video turned out really well, so pass on our compliments to her.

50:25.360 --> 50:26.360
It's great.

50:26.360 --> 50:32.360
It's pretty fun to have animated cartoon versions of you.

50:32.360 --> 50:41.360
Is staying in touch with a video game and gamer scene important to you guys as a band?

50:41.360 --> 50:45.360
As Freezepop continues to get bigger and bigger, are you still going to be contributing to

50:45.360 --> 50:47.360
video game projects?

50:47.360 --> 50:49.360
I sure hope so.

50:49.360 --> 50:53.360
I'd love to stay as close to that community as possible.

50:53.360 --> 50:57.360
The kids are really fun, and it's such a wide group.

50:57.360 --> 51:00.040
I mean, it's not just, like, you know, 14-year-old boys.

51:00.040 --> 51:05.360
We get people coming to our concert, and instead of bringing CDs to sign, they'll bring, like,

51:05.360 --> 51:09.720
copies of Amplitude, or maybe they'll bring copies of Guitar Hero now.

51:09.720 --> 51:14.800
We played a show in Portland last fall, and this guy brought his PlayStation 2 and had

51:14.800 --> 51:17.800
us autograph his PlayStation 2, which was kind of surreal.

51:17.800 --> 51:18.800
That's awesome.

51:18.800 --> 51:22.800
and uh... yeah i hope we get to play a lot a lot of shows that kind of appeal

51:22.800 --> 51:24.560
to the gaming community

51:24.560 --> 51:28.480
uh... there's a bunch of other band out there that are also kind of video game

51:28.480 --> 51:30.640
related like eight bit weapon

51:30.640 --> 51:34.760
and uh... it's really fun to play with them and um... kind of just

51:34.760 --> 51:35.400
you know it

51:35.400 --> 51:37.180
our fans who are

51:37.180 --> 51:38.200
uh... more like

51:38.200 --> 51:41.580
got a good musically than find out that they can play video games with the

51:41.580 --> 51:44.840
video game people then find out we have like CDs and play shows and

51:44.840 --> 51:47.080
so it's definitely a lot of fun all around

51:47.080 --> 51:53.080
You guys should hook up with 8Bit Weapon and these other bands that create the video game-centric

51:53.080 --> 51:55.520
music and do a game of Palooza over the summer.

51:55.520 --> 51:56.520
That would be awesome.

51:56.520 --> 51:57.520
That would be pretty amazing.

51:57.520 --> 52:02.640
It might be a little bit of a logistical problem.

52:02.640 --> 52:09.160
All of us bands are pretty up-and-coming and very DIY, and we don't have labels, we don't

52:09.160 --> 52:14.080
have managers, we don't have booking agents, so we kind of do it ourselves.

52:14.080 --> 52:19.840
It's sometimes a little bit of a logistical problem to get everybody to all show up in

52:19.840 --> 52:22.560
the same cities all at once, but it certainly would be fun.

52:22.560 --> 52:29.420
A lot of you guys probably have day jobs like we do here at Orange Lounge Radio, too.

52:29.420 --> 52:36.460
That sometimes gets in the way of being fabulous international rock stars.

52:36.460 --> 52:40.560
We've actually heard, because we do a lot of coverage of music-centric video games here

52:40.560 --> 52:44.960
on Orange Lounge, we heard of you guys being involved with a new dance game called Neon

52:44.960 --> 52:45.960
FM.

52:45.960 --> 52:48.160
What are you guys exactly contributing to this project?

52:48.160 --> 52:49.160
Just some music?

52:49.160 --> 52:54.880
Well, that's kind of confusing, and I don't know how much I should comment on it.

52:54.880 --> 53:01.400
I'm friends with the two guys, the two Ericks, who kind of have set the game up, and honestly,

53:01.400 --> 53:04.320
I don't even know what the status of the game is right now.

53:04.320 --> 53:05.320
Neither do we.

53:05.320 --> 53:06.320
That's why…

53:06.320 --> 53:07.320
Say again?

53:07.320 --> 53:17.380
Every time I talk to him, we actually got a chance to meet them finally.

53:17.380 --> 53:22.140
They drove up to see a show in Pittsburgh last fall, so we got a chance to hang out

53:22.140 --> 53:23.140
with them.

53:23.140 --> 53:24.140
It was really cool.

53:24.140 --> 53:26.460
I know they had some ups and downs with the games, and it would be really great for the

53:26.460 --> 53:31.620
games to come out, but honestly, I don't know a whole lot of information about it.

53:31.620 --> 53:34.940
We were excited to put a couple of songs in the games, and then we pulled one out, but

53:34.940 --> 53:39.540
We were going to write an exclusive song for the game, and I guess we're just kind of waiting

53:39.540 --> 53:46.460
to hear if it actually comes out, but we would love to contribute songs to it because letting

53:46.460 --> 53:49.220
people dance to our music is always fun entertainment.

53:49.220 --> 53:53.540
It would be great to just see a new dance game come out in the arcades too, something

53:53.540 --> 53:59.820
to kind of bring some energy back to the arcades because the arcade scene has been lacking.

53:59.820 --> 54:05.300
More people come out with awesome rhythm action games, dance games, and music games.

54:05.300 --> 54:11.880
It just uses a whole new energy, and you get to see how other game companies approach dealing

54:11.880 --> 54:15.660
with the subject matter, what music they choose, and all that kind of thing.

54:15.660 --> 54:19.020
It's definitely good to have lots of people who have got their fingers into the mix and

54:19.020 --> 54:20.020
stuff.

54:20.020 --> 54:23.940
It'll be really exciting to see them get that game out there in the arcades.

54:23.940 --> 54:24.940
Absolutely.

54:24.940 --> 54:27.700
Are there any other upcoming projects that you can speak about possibly?

54:27.700 --> 54:34.180
Armonix is definitely working on some new game ideas, unfortunately I can't really

54:34.180 --> 54:35.180
talk about them.

54:35.180 --> 54:41.900
Of course, we've got some amazing buzz coming off of the Guitar Hero game and it was really

54:41.900 --> 54:45.780
actually pretty exciting to get a freeze-pop song on there considering that we don't

54:45.780 --> 54:52.480
actually have any real instruments in our band at all, but we're working on some interesting

54:52.480 --> 54:57.520
games and I think there might be some surprises in the future with what we come up with.

54:57.520 --> 54:58.880
You bring up a good point though.

54:58.880 --> 55:03.620
How did you manage to get a song in Guitar Hero when you guys don't really use guitars

55:03.620 --> 55:04.680
in a lot of your music?

55:04.680 --> 55:08.920
Did you write a song specifically with guitars in mind or how did that work?

55:08.920 --> 55:14.520
Fortunately, we actually had a song that was all about rocking even though we don't really

55:14.520 --> 55:18.400
rock because we have no drummers or guitar players or anything like that.

55:18.400 --> 55:21.240
You can still rock without guitars and drums, I think.

55:21.240 --> 55:24.800
yeah it was the proper first album in it you know it's kind of funny because

55:24.800 --> 55:29.720
there's kind of a rip off of iron man at the end of the song and so when like

55:29.720 --> 55:33.480
the game kind of got underway and they were figuring out how to deal with all

55:33.480 --> 55:38.240
the kind of the unlock songs and they were really supportive about going to a

55:38.240 --> 55:43.680
bunch of local boston bands a bunch of different harmonic employees all put

55:43.680 --> 55:48.080
songs in the game and so i you know i think the president of harmonica

55:48.080 --> 55:53.280
like you got to be able to put a song in the game even if you have no guitar in it at all

55:53.280 --> 55:57.320
I think it would be super funny to have you guys in the game and I kind of thought about

55:57.320 --> 56:01.520
it I knew which song I wanted to put in because it had to be a song about you know rocking

56:01.520 --> 56:05.520
out and uh but I was kind of debating for a long time whether or not there should be

56:05.520 --> 56:11.320
guitar or no guitar and would it be funnier to play a synthesizer part on the guitar or

56:11.320 --> 56:17.440
but ultimately I went with uh putting a guitar part on there and I had um a long time friend

56:17.440 --> 56:23.920
Izzy Maxwell, who has actually done some remixes for Freeze Pop and he is a really shredding

56:23.920 --> 56:24.920
guitar player.

56:24.920 --> 56:30.120
So I kind of said, ìIzzy, I need you to record a screaming metal guitar part over this and

56:30.120 --> 56:33.880
he kind of just went to town.î I think he created actually a really fun guitar part

56:33.880 --> 56:35.880
to play in the game.

56:35.880 --> 56:42.000
Well, I'm kind of wondering, obviously Guitar Hero, lots and lots of people are buying this

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
game.

56:43.000 --> 56:44.980
It's doing very well and critically it's doing well.

56:44.980 --> 56:48.760
I think it's a given that there's got to be a sequel in the works, whether you can say

56:48.760 --> 56:50.520
anything about it or not.

56:50.520 --> 56:52.920
Do you think Freeze Pop will be involved with the sequel as well?

56:52.920 --> 56:53.920
Oh, man.

56:53.920 --> 56:55.920
If there's a sequel, we've got to come up with.

56:55.920 --> 56:58.000
The thing is, we don't even have a song we could use.

56:58.000 --> 57:02.040
We may have to write a sequel song to get ready to rock.

57:02.040 --> 57:03.120
it's like

57:03.120 --> 57:06.800
we got ready but now we're rocking

57:06.800 --> 57:08.500
but something like that

57:08.500 --> 57:12.440
not sure what's going to happen but then you know it's always exciting to um...

57:12.440 --> 57:15.960
to see you know if the game is appropriate for putting one of our songs

57:15.960 --> 57:18.000
on there even if it's kind of a stretch

57:18.000 --> 57:21.280
art you know there were some reviews for guitar hero with people who

57:21.280 --> 57:23.760
were really surprised we got a song on there and

57:23.760 --> 57:27.120
and kind of almost gave the game extra kudos for kind of going out on a whim

57:27.120 --> 57:28.040
and putting a

57:28.040 --> 57:31.880
almost an inappropriate song into a guitar game.

57:31.880 --> 57:37.720
It worked out beautifully and I think it pleases the long-time fans of Freezepop via Harmonix

57:37.720 --> 57:42.400
and I think the folks who were playing Guitar Hero and had never heard of you guys probably

57:42.400 --> 57:44.440
had a chance to rock out to the song as well.

57:44.440 --> 57:50.560
Weíre already starting to get some emails from some fans who are like, ìIíve never

57:50.560 --> 57:55.120
heard of you guys and I saw you in the gameî and then you go to your website and they figure

57:55.120 --> 58:00.080
out who you are and they decide whether or not you think you're a complete idiot or

58:00.080 --> 58:02.280
they like your music.

58:02.280 --> 58:05.940
We get our little share hate mail which is kind of interesting.

58:05.940 --> 58:07.340
It's kind of fun.

58:07.340 --> 58:11.900
It's exciting to know that you impacted somebody whether or not you totally rocked

58:11.900 --> 58:14.700
their world or you made them completely hate you.

58:14.700 --> 58:16.980
I mean at least you made an impression on them.

58:16.980 --> 58:19.100
Mike Stowe We get the hate mail too here at Orange Lounge

58:19.100 --> 58:20.380
once in a while.

58:20.380 --> 58:24.980
It's kind of interesting to think that what you did motivated somebody to sit down and

58:24.980 --> 58:29.740
actually ride out you know dear orange lounger in your kid your fry i hate you

58:29.740 --> 58:33.780
yeah it's going to get a little something a little nasty although the

58:33.780 --> 58:37.660
more inventive the hate mail but the more excited i get we had a fair one

58:37.660 --> 58:38.740
from

58:38.740 --> 58:40.700
email up some pictures

58:40.700 --> 58:43.540
where he had taken one of our cdc he

58:43.540 --> 58:46.440
he smashed it up into a billion pieces and

58:46.440 --> 58:48.540
and then he ate a popsicle

58:48.540 --> 58:52.480
and he spit popsicle juice all over the artwork in the cdc

58:52.480 --> 59:03.400
He took pictures of us and e-mailed them to us, and I was excited because he created a

59:03.400 --> 59:08.840
piece of art himself, and so every now and then when we get a new piece of anti-freeze

59:08.840 --> 59:14.000
pop e-mail, I forwarded them that e-mail and asked them to maybe try a little bit harder

59:14.000 --> 59:15.000
next time.

59:15.000 --> 59:20.880
That doesn't make them super happy either, but you know what can you do?

59:20.880 --> 59:24.360
I have to ask all of our guests on the show this question, what are some of your favorite

59:24.360 --> 59:29.720
games to play outside of these music games we've been talking about earlier?

59:29.720 --> 59:38.720
I'm definitely an old school person, old 8-bit Atari 2600 games are still my favorite.

59:38.720 --> 59:43.120
The thing about games where you have to invest incredible amounts of time to beat the game

59:43.120 --> 59:45.480
is a little bit frustrating to me.

59:45.480 --> 59:49.080
mike's my interaction with games is definitely more of a cover

59:49.080 --> 59:53.640
a transitional short time experience and quite a bit to sit down

59:53.640 --> 59:56.960
play a couple of levels of something and feel but don't feel bad when i want to

59:56.960 --> 59:57.900
like you know

59:57.900 --> 01:00:01.800
not sit there for like ten hours or have to come back to a day after day

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:06.740
but i definitely had no big fans of like dollars revenge and sub hunt and

01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:10.240
it kind of old a pic games i think you know i can do a game

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:13.640
uh... i play a lot and just kind of see what people do a lot

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:18.220
I worked for a race car driving video game company for a while, so I really got into

01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:24.460
NASCAR games and race car games and stuff, which is pretty random, but I like to check

01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:25.460
those out.

01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:30.660
We just got a 360 at Harmonics, we've been checking out the new racing games and stuff

01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:31.660
like that.

01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:40.180
I'm not sure, obviously I'm a huge fan of the games inside the genre, Rez was a huge

01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:47.180
game for me, and like, Vib-Ribbon, and um, uh...

01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:51.420
Now that's great you named Vib-Ribbon because that game didn't even come out in this country,

01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:53.740
and we know that game, that's an awesome game.

01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:59.740
Yeah, we have some Japanese PS2s, and we're big fans of a lot of the Japanese games. You

01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:06.220
know, the guy who came up with Vib-Ribbon, and you know, Unjammer Lambie, and those games

01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:09.240
are really super fun to play.

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:11.740
Guitar Man is kind of interesting, definitely check that out.

01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:14.180
Itís a difficult game, thatís for certain.

01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:16.500
You know, Iím a big fan of Katamari Damacy.

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:20.700
Those games that are kind of quirky and left of center are some of my favorite ones.

01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:23.180
It sounds like we have a lot of the same tastes in games.

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:28.220
Those are games weíre always talking about on here, so thatís awesome.

01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:32.380
So thatís about all I wanted to ask you game-wise, but I want to give you a chance to plug any

01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:35.540
albums or tour dates youíve got coming up that you want to tell our listeners about.

01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:36.540
Hereís your chance.

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:37.540
Well, letís see.

01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:44.420
If things are kind of quiet, weíre working on a new FreezePop album, and itís well underway.

01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:49.260
We donít know when itís going to be done, but definitely pay attention to our website,

01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:52.900
Weíre playing a bunch of shows in March and April.

01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:59.420
Weíre going to be in Ohio and Indiana and I think weíre going to go up to Chicago in

01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:03.700
March and then weíll be over in England to play in London and Leeds and a couple of cities

01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:06.140
over there at the end of April.

01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:10.460
Definitely just pay attention to our website because weíll probably be out on the West

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:15.360
Coast as well, maybe like in the fall and hopefully weíll have a new album, so there

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:16.360
you go.

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:17.360
Awesome.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:21.840
All right, so freezepop.com to stay in tune with all the latest information, whatís going

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:22.840
on with FreezePop.

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:27.000
Yeah, weíre on MySpace too, so come and be our friend there as well.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
All right, awesome.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.720
So, Kassen aka The Duke from FreezePop, thank you so much for being on Orange Lounge Radio

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:33.880
and spending time with us this week.

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:34.880
Oh, itís super fun.

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:35.880
Thanks for having me.

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:36.880
All right, no problem.

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:43.720
That was very, very cool, especially the VIB ribbon mention, because Iím like, ìVib ribbon!î

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:46.120
Does that guy know how to rock, or what?

01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:51.260
is now my second favorite band. Next to Gorillaz? Next to Gorillaz. They even have

01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:55.540
surpassed Pain and that, because you know we all know Pain is good, freeze

01:02:55.540 --> 01:03:00.900
pop yay. I totally blanked and forgot to ask about Supernova and the chat room

01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:04.080
hates me for it I know but I totally didn't even think to ask about

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:10.240
Supernova but we'll talk about Supernova in the next hour but anyway. You know I'm

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:14.880
glad he has a lot of common interests you know in types of games that he plays

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:22.020
and stuff but I still don't like their music you can just die why I just I

01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:26.460
really don't like them I mean they're probably a really cool band but nothing

01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:30.600
I've heard so far I just I don't like that type of music I don't know it's

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:35.520
just I'm sorry I just don't I like freeze pops music the same way I like

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:40.860
8-bit weapon mm-hmm just the whole just a little

01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:43.500
quickie-synthy vibe and they remind me of Berlin.

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.940
He mentioned 8-bit weapons, so I think they're kinda buddy bands.

01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:49.940
Yeah, I really dig 8-bit weapons. You know what else I thought was interesting about that?

01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:53.100
He said that they have a Xbox 360 at Harmonix.

01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:57.660
Hmm. I wonder why. Maybe for

01:03:57.660 --> 01:04:00.940
playing Madden 2006. Maybe.

01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:04.620
We can speculate all we want, but we'll never know. Alright, we're running a

01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:05.660
little long tonight

01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:09.060
for a show, but that's alright. We can do what we want. It's our show. It's our show.

01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:14.060
Now we're going to go to something completely different. We're going to visit our friends overseas for a little bit.

01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:16.060
And now for something completely different.

01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:19.060
Well, good segway!

01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:21.060
Oh, not to be seen!

01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:25.060
He got an article for us about another list, another dang list.

01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:30.060
Okay, this is put out by Yahoo Games UK.

01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:39.060
They did a top 100. You can look there for all of it. It'll be on uk.videogames.games.yahoo.com, blah blah blah blah blah blah.

01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:40.060
You'll find the link.

01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:45.060
But I'd like to go ahead and list the top 10 games according to Yahoo! UK.

01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:48.060
Number 10. Ready?

01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:49.060
Heck yeah.

01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:50.060
Elite.

01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:53.060
On the BBC Micro.

01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:56.060
I don't even know what the hell that is. That's alright.

01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:59.060
I've never played it. I've heard of it though. I know the game. I've just not played it.

01:04:59.060 --> 01:05:03.400
just not played a game system you don't have I do you know I do not have a BBC

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:06.560
micro and I need to have one it wouldn't work on our TV chef you have a little

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:10.800
you know I actually have a system I now have a system so old I cannot play on my

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:17.560
TV what's that an Odyssey 2 oh yeah oh those things are old yeah my TV is like

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:22.120
why do we have to do these lists all the time what motivates people to make lists

01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:25.880
I think it's hilarious all right so we can talk about this we can all right

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:29.040
number nine. My number one cause of motion sickness

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:32.640
Goldeneye 007 on the Nintendo 64

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:36.320
this was the one game that made me puke literally

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:39.600
not because it was a bad game because it gave me vertigo

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:43.320
but it was a really awesome game and you know

01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:47.640
I don't think there has been a good as good of a bond game since

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:50.760
Goldeneye was excellent

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:54.920
number eight Street Fighter 2 coming soon to Xbox arcade

01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:59.840
I mean this was the one that brought you the world warriors this this set the

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:05.200
stage for for it for 2d fighting for even a lot of 3d fighters mm-hmm because

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:10.320
you know we actually we even have the Street Fighter EX series okay coming up

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:17.000
for number seven Super Mario Kart good choice good choice you know and it

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:22.240
really I do agree with this it says it seemed like the worst idea ever but

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:28.160
quickly proved itself as the best thing ever that was my college dorm life was

01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:33.700
mario kart like every weekend and that might well the if you were in my room it

01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:36.240
was mario kart as we were the nerd room but if you're in the room down the hall

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:41.080
it was you know smoke weed and drink you know what mine was what because I was

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:46.120
like the only one in our building that had a TV huh mine was toshinden because

01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:50.720
my roommate at the time the boyfriend had a PlayStation you dork and also

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:54.420
going over to play my friend Saturn cuz he imported a Japanese Saturn so I was

01:06:54.420 --> 01:07:00.860
playing this stupid Gundam game and golden axe the duel we're gonna reminisce

01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:05.660
all night long let's move next game up monkey island to let Chuck's revenge you

01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:11.460
know I could not get in the monkey island game so whatever and let's see

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:19.340
that was number six number five Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time yeah I'm still

01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:23.060
partial to the Super Nintendo one but I won't get into that discussion tonight

01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:26.500
because we're running long because people don't like it when I say the

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:32.780
ocarina of time is way overrated but anyway lies lies they argue so he lives

01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:36.980
oh hi hi glad you could pull yourself a Mario Kart for a minute talk to us

01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:41.020
actually I do apologize no that was number five number four Pro Evolution

01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:50.060
soccer 4. We are talking about the UK. I know. The real football! Men in shorts! Yeah. Whatever.

01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:57.560
It's really fun. I actually kind of want to play. Hey, it's Konami. Nice plug there. Next

01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:03.560
up, number 3. Pokemon Red slash Green. Whichever one of those. I still like the Pikachu one

01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:08.240
best but still. But, you know, I thought it was pretty funny the way that Pokemon came

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:13.960
about was that the creator of it was a bug collector.

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:14.960
And high?

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:15.960
I guess!

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:18.960
On crack or something.

01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:24.160
But did you know that the character who was Gary Oak in the Japanese one, he's Okido Shigeru

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:25.160
and Shigeru after Shigeru Miyamoto.

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:27.040
I will forget that five seconds from now.

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:28.520
But he was named after Miyamoto.

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:29.520
Oh, okay.

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:30.520
How's that for you?

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:31.520
Okay, that's cool.

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:32.520
That I'll remember.

01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:34.800
Super Mario 64 is number two.

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:37.160
I love these overrated games on Liz.

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:41.960
another one I think is totally over okay significance for me because when I

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:47.960
first moved out here Dan and I would play that game for hours and we were all

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:53.440
cute Mario I can think of three better Mario games off top my head Mario Kart

01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:59.160
DS Mario Kart Mario Kart on Super Nintendo Super Mario World Super Mario

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:04.640
Bros 3 and Super Mario World but that's just me what do I know I'm just so

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:09.240
Shmo that you downloaded on your iPhone. Number one game ever guaranteed to piss

01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:18.440
some people off. Namely Loki. Tetris! Even better, specifically Game Boy Tetris. I

01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:22.160
think that's a good way to end the first part of our show tonight. Oh wait no no

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:24.680
I got one. I actually did though want to bring up a few of the others that were on

01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:31.280
the list. Notables. Number 21 was Samba de Amigo. Yes! Number 35 Beat

01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:36.440
beat mania number forty nine surprising when a lot of people don't know about beat mania

01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:42.000
UK this is a had beat mania UK they had beat mania in the UK ok whatever number forty nine

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:48.560
was DDR sixty five and this makes me happy tempest two thousand oh yeah oh that's too

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:53.440
low too low too low it needs to be like number three yeah instead of mario sixty four and

01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:57.620
this is one this is probably my single favorite shooting game of all time even though I suck

01:09:57.620 --> 01:10:03.240
at it our type it's what this that game makes me want to do that Linkin Park

01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:07.960
song you know went so long and got so far been the end it didn't matter

01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:11.920
because you can't beat that game unless you're like God shall I do three

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:17.400
shooting games I enjoy more than our type okay and number 100 number 99 was

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:22.960
pong number 100 was hard-driving you know I'm surprised pac-man what's in the

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:26.560
top ten because every every top list always has pac-man somewhere on it and

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:30.720
rightfully so I mean what does have a severe tarnish on its name the Atari

01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:35.760
2600 version hmm but hard drive in I had to mention it because it has

01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:39.840
significance for me I used to work at an Amco arcade when I lived in Alabama and

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:44.000
you had that swivel out chair when you sit inside it's really dark I used to

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.680
take naps at work in the hard drive in machine you know and this kind of leads

01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:51.720
into the next story I was watching I was watching a documentary on PBS I don't

01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:54.040
know if you guys have seen this but there's a documentary I know miklotov

01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:59.420
saw part of this with me yesterday. It's two hours long, I only could watch the first hour

01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:04.860
because it's like trying to explain what video games are all about to people that don't really

01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:10.060
know about video games, because it's PBS and let's face it, the average audience for PBS,

01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:13.020
and I'm not going to say this is right or wrong, but the average audience for PBS is

01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:20.380
not your typical gamer. Old people? Yeah. Hey, hey, hey, PBS gave me Red Dwarf, so shut

01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:24.380
And they also have the ABBA special once in a while, if you know when to look.

01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:27.380
Where in the world is Carmen San Diego?

01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:29.380
Alright, Square One TV, I know it.

01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:32.380
Alright, so PBS does have some cool stuff, don't get me wrong.

01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:33.380
3-2-1 contact.

01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:36.380
I don't want to get hate mail from PBS, there's some good stuff on there,

01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:39.380
but let's face it, either you're young or you're old,

01:11:39.380 --> 01:11:41.380
a lot of people in the middle don't watch it, and maybe...

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:43.380
And Reading Rainbow!

01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:45.380
Sesame Street.

01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:47.380
Can I talk about the video game thing, please?

01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:48.380
Video what?

01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:52.260
I actually learned some stuff that I didn't know before though even though

01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:54.300
there's some horrible inconsistencies in it like

01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:57.180
they would talk about the Zelda that was released for Super Nintendo and they're

01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:57.840
showing

01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:02.260
Zelda to the Adventures of Link and I was like, dammit! But it was HD so it was pretty.

01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:05.500
But what I thought was interesting, they did, they

01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:09.020
changed the name of Pac-Man when they released it over here because Pac-Man in

01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:09.700
Japan was

01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:13.540
Puck-Man. Do you know why they changed it?

01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:17.420
They were afraid of people taking a magic marker and taking it and turning it into an F

01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:24.300
and turning the P into an F so you'd have fuck man. You learn something new every week

01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:29.300
here on Orange Lounge Radio. There was X-Man on the 2600. I dunno. Alright. That was one

01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:34.940
of those porn games. Like Custer's Revenge? Alright, we're gonna take a break here and

01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:39.620
It was worse. Trust me, it was worse. When we come back on Orange Lounge Radio, we will

01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:43.260
talk about DDR Supernova. I promise we'll get into DDR Supernova because a lot of our

01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:49.300
Our longtime fans are dying to hear it and also we're gonna open up the skype line get some of your calls here

01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:53.260
Who's gonna be our first caller on the podcast? I don't know. We're gonna find out very soon

01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:55.980
