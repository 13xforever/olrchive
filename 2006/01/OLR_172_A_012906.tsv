14090	25969	Tonight, January 29th, 2006, we speak with Rick Sanchez, Vice President of Content for GameTap, his World of Warcraft against gay and lesbian guilds, and we give you a complete wrap-up of Konami Gamers Day.
32296	36259	Welcome, everybody, to another week here on Orange Lounge Radio.
36379	40782	It is Sunday, January 29th, and you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
40902	46426	Or maybe if you're listening to this the podcast way, it's any day you want, because the podcast thing lets you do that.
46807	50149	Anyway, we are here to talk about video games and all the news you really want to know about.
50309	51270	My name is Rob Roberts.
51290	52251	You might know me as Sky.
52631	56594	Joining me, as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
58215	59556	With off-microphone.
60430	60910	That's alright.
61250	64471	Dang it, this has just been, like, crap week, so... That's alright.
64571	66371	Forgive me for being a little flustered.
66651	67111	That's alright.
67151	69112	How you doing, besides crap and flustered?
69152	69632	I'm in pain.
69952	70272	Okay.
70292	70952	Because I worked out.
71792	77233	I did not play a game that worked out yesterday like a good girl.
77253	78774	I went to the gym, but I was gaming all the rest of the week.
79174	83275	Alright, well, we'll get to gaming in just a minute, but it would be rude of me not to introduce the one and only Loki!
84175	84395	Hi.
84695	85415	Hi, Loki, how you doing?
86343	88845	Frustrated I couldn't get on a motorcycle for some reason.
89385	93308	They were too fast for my character in Grand Theft Auto Liberty City.
93389	95850	At first I was like, you ride motorcycles?
95870	97292	Do you have a class A license?
97612	99193	No, no.
100034	105378	Because I think I put the aggressive driver's code in before I got a motorcycle and so it made it a little bit tougher to get one.
106570	108531	Okay, well, sorry to hear it.
109952	119698	Also joining us, since once in a while we like to invite a special guest on to fill out our fourth chair here in the studio, say hello to Miklatov, who was just here two weeks ago.
119798	120659	Two weeks ago, yes.
120699	121279	But he's back.
121699	121980	Hello.
122120	122560	How you doing?
122900	123200	Fine.
123521	123721	Yeah?
124061	124181	Yep.
124659	130142	Mikhail Tov, for those that don't know, works for Konami, but his role is top secret, so we don't really talk about Konami.
130362	132123	Actually, we have a lot of Konami to talk about tonight.
132363	133864	Yeah, it makes me sad, too.
133904	136865	You'll just have to roll your eyes at the whole thing, I guess, or turn your back.
136885	138206	I just said I didn't get to go.
139127	140587	We'll talk about that a little later.
141208	142388	That's hour two.
142548	143349	Oh, hour two, okay.
143989	144249	All right.
145050	149272	Anyway, welcome, everybody, and I hope you enjoyed the show last week.
149292	150813	You got a lot of good feedback and stuff.
152116	152677	World of Warcraft
171923	173484	How's the world of Warcraft going for you?
173724	174704	It's actually going good.
175945	177926	It's kind of fun, having a good time.
178926	181807	I like that I don't have to party, but I also hate that I don't have to party.
183228	187670	And beyond that, I got giddy this week when they announced that Pirate...
188177	191238	or Corsair was a job class now in Final Fantasy XI.
191398	194599	Oh yeah, I heard about this in the expansion pack that they're going to be doing.
194980	198641	It's Blue Mage and Corsair and then we don't know what else yet.
198781	200642	Okay, but a Corsair is pretty much a pirate, right?
200722	202662	With Gambler also mixed in.
202742	204223	Okay, so let me get this right.
205144	209268	Final Fantasy XI has a job class for ninja, and now they have a job class for pirate.
209828	211530	So now you're going to have ninja versus pirates.
211850	214633	Or ninja slash pirates, or pirate slash ninjas.
214673	219017	Doesn't that throw off the balance of the universe, though, to have ninja and then pirate as your sub-job?
219417	220678	Or pirate and then ninja as your sub-job?
220718	221279	That's wrong.
221359	222580	That's like a conflict of interest.
222820	223941	No, because they get along.
224061	225423	Everybody knows they really get along.
226323	229947	It's like, what's those hicks that fought all the time?
231138	232639	The Hatfields and McCoys.
232679	233779	Yeah, those people.
234179	235540	They probably really got along.
235840	236780	Just like Pirates and Ninjas.
236820	239201	But if they did have a fight, Pirates would win.
239361	246524	So now, for those that don't know Miklatov, which I imagine most people don't, you are infatuated with the color blue.
246624	247244	You love blue.
247645	248105	Yes, I do.
249269	250309	But you're not going to play a blue mage.
250349	252070	Nope, I'm going to play a Corsair because it's a pirate.
252130	252830	That makes no sense.
252991	255371	So pirates outrank blue things for you.
255792	256652	In this game, yes.
257112	260153	For some reason, they gave a blue mage really crappy armor.
260654	261494	It looks really stupid.
261914	264895	But a pirate looks like a pirate, and that's all that matters.
265716	266936	I'm sure I can get blue pirate armor.
266956	267496	I'll be happy.
268277	270317	Okay, I really don't know how to follow that up.
270437	271558	So anything else you want to share?
272284	273284	Played more Mario Kart.
273304	276026	I'm up to... How many wins do you have there?
276066	276346	Like 1,500?
276466	277106	Yeah, 1,500 something.
277146	277646	You're sad.
278187	282529	I think some of our chatters are trying to get a game of Mario Kart DS going on right now.
283049	283669	Live on Sunday.
283869	286190	They're cool, except they're playing online, so it sucks.
286750	288011	OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
288031	291533	Click on chat if you want to join in the fun.
291613	292513	Why does online suck?
292653	293874	Because you can only have four people.
294134	298096	And then whoever doesn't get first place always drops out for the next race.
298556	298736	So...
299417	300658	Call of Duty 2, Animal Crossing DS
329602	331182	How's life in Animal Crossing?
332043	333123	I'm about to pay off.
334263	336003	I'm not even sure what mortgage it is.
336844	340224	It's basically the second room in the house.
341325	343625	So I have one extra room.
343665	345265	Now I'm going to get a second extra room.
345905	348446	And then there's one more extra room and then I'm done.
349646	349826	Awesome.
350086	353267	So I have like a hundred and some thousand dollars worth of
353686	358050	And when they try to run up to talk to me, I run away I just out them, and then that usually does it
383308	388230	You know, I accuse them of having, you know, gay orgies and stuff like that.
388250	390832	And usually they get embarrassed and move away.
392512	392833	Alright.
393673	394974	Anything else you want to share about your gaming week?
396134	397415	Um, no.
397675	398815	No, that's pretty much it.
399496	400396	I didn't play much else.
400796	401076	Alright.
401357	402057	I'll go next then.
402557	404118	My gaming week actually wasn't that exciting.
404718	406519	I did play a little bit of World of Warcraft.
407380	410301	I played Silent Hill 4 at the request of Miklatov earlier today.
410321	411061	For five minutes.
411081	411962	For like five minutes.
412910	415351	I made pretty good progress for 15 minutes of playing.
436571	437732	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
437752	440133	I got a Game Boy Micro this week.
440153	441474	Oh, with the itty-bitty, itty-bitty ones.
441494	442575	What's your faceplate look like?
442635	443775	It's the plain black one.
467169	468792	It's dark like my soul.
468952	469693	How boring.
470474	472036	No, I like it.
472177	473719	I'm not going to complain because it's free.
474560	476202	I'm not going to say how I obtained it either.
477284	477745	Oh, really?
478326	479628	Through nefarious means.
480228	481851	You know, packed with the dark powers.
483749	486590	Okay, you're kind of scaring me here a little bit.
486610	488471	And we got a free copy of Pokemon Emerald with it too.
488751	489131	Oh, that's cool.
489151	491952	But I took it out from promptly and put in YY Racing.
492193	494313	Can you actually read text on those little things?
494634	497835	Yes, I played the hell out of Space Harrier on that thing.
498115	498355	Really?
498815	501156	Yep, because I loves me some Space Harrier.
501296	503597	I have really yet to really sit down with a micro.
503857	505278	I saw it at E3 and that was about it.
505678	506579	I'll let you play it during the break.
507219	507499	Cool.
507895	509936	My opinion of it has not changed one bit.
510397	514780	When I remember looking at it at E3, I'm like, wow, this is the most useless thing I've ever seen.
515280	516181	It's actually pretty cool.
517442	522205	And I like it because I can just carry it with me wherever because it's little and it will fit in my pocket.
522245	523626	Because it's a fashion accessory?
524567	526729	Like something Paris Hilton would have hanging from her purse?
526949	528970	No, because Paris Hilton... Like you have hanging from your cell phone?
529030	529251	Oh, no.
529271	530952	Because Paris Hilton is a stupid whore.
531712	531972	All right.
532813	532973	Look.
533834	534294	Correction.
534534	535315	Stupid spoiled whore.
536547	537288	Oh, that is kind of cute.
537368	538548	It is so cute.
538608	539069	Oh, look at that.
539329	539969	Black and silver.
539989	540669	It's in the palm of my hand.
540689	542791	This news is like so six months old, these micros.
543171	544331	I'm seeing one for the first time.
544992	546252	That is kind of cute, up close.
546833	547593	I forgot what I put in there.
548454	548834	Let me see.
549654	551355	Oh, they have feet on the bottom here.
551595	551755	Yep.
551995	555897	Let's see what game Jamie has in her Game Boy Micro.
558539	558879	Let's see.
559139	563321	Oh, you have Guardian Heroes Advance.
564182	564502	Good game.
566135	566535	Good choice.
566955	567956	I have good taste in games.
567976	569436	I'm going to play a lot of Animal Crossing, too.
569456	572317	I'm about 200 bells from paying off my fourth loan.
573837	576318	And I'll get my fifth loan paid off.
576478	580259	I'm doing it to where I'm paying off $100,000 a week because I want to pace myself.
580460	582540	So the game's still entertaining for both of you guys?
582560	584481	Because I'm a little bored with Animal Crossing.
584501	587082	I got rid of it within a week of having it.
587582	592703	I visit other people's towns once in a while to order things from my catalog for them, but that's about it.
593043	594444	Which reminds me, I have to get you a pinball machine.
594853	597195	Wow, I'm a Capcom fan tonight.
597315	597595	Why?
597875	601618	You're pulling more Game Boy games out of the... Super Street Fighter 2 and Puzzle Fighter.
603400	605602	I didn't even know they made Puzzle Fighter for Game Boy Advance.
606002	606382	See?
606562	610806	What a cool... And then I'm going to get my DS fight.
612107	612347	All right.
613548	614068	Let's see.
614609	617511	That's about it, I guess, for Gaming Week then.
617611	620333	If nobody else has anything additional they want to add?
620934	621014	Um...
622648	623088	No, not really.
623649	626131	Is it just me or is tonight a little bit of an off night?
626211	627532	I think we all feel like a little bit.
627592	629053	I was very, very sick yesterday.
629093	631034	I got really, really sick last night.
631374	633116	And I'll get into that when I get into the FUs of the week.
633156	634296	But that's the reason I'm off.
634657	636018	I know Jamie's off a little bit.
636038	637419	She talked about that earlier in the show.
637439	638399	I told someone off today.
639160	639340	Why?
639500	639980	What did they do?
640801	641301	Rude woman.
643003	643723	For being a woman?
643783	644664	Is that why you told her off?
644724	645945	I was hanging out with Tia today.
646765	647846	And this woman shoved Tia.
649788	651569	And I was like, you can say excuse me.
652612	655314	She's all like, I did, very softly.
655394	657815	I'm like, well next time say it where people can hear you.
658856	662618	And then she got behind us in line and said, some people need to clean out their ears.
662658	664519	I said, some people need to learn how to speak up.
665259	666120	Where was this at?
666160	666700	Barnes & Noble.
667000	667120	Oh.
667641	668661	We were buying tarot cards.
669182	671463	Were you trying to start a fight in the middle of Barnes & Noble?
671603	673344	No, but she shoved to you.
673484	675525	She was just using her library voice.
676766	678207	Yes, she was using her library voice.
678607	681749	Dude, she was right behind us and I could not hear her and I have good hearing.
684551	686132	Wait, I'm going to put that theory to the test.
686172	686472	Hold on.
687873	688994	Jamie sucks.
690515	691075	I know you do.
694278	694858	Moving on.
696499	698360	Let's get into some actual news, shall we?
699941	704745	Loki, while I beat up Jamie, could you tell us a little bit about what's going on with the Nintendo DS?
704765	706386	You wish you could.
706446	708387	I ain't going to use my library voice when I do it either.
708647	714091	Okay, so the DS, it was, yes, we're redesigning it, then no, we're redesigning it, and now...
715037	721901	It was basically, we have nothing to announce today, but tomorrow, that's a whole different story.
722041	728765	So, yeah, they basically announced a few days later after the whole, you know, conspiracy theory that they were going to announce a redesign.
729565	734108	Because I love how they have to be right and, you know, at all times.
734568	741652	It's like, yes, we have nothing to, just like I said last week, we have nothing to, you know, say at this time, but, you know.
742296	744118	So anyways, they announced the DS Lite.
744158	746880	It's a lot thinner, a lot smaller, and it's white.
748301	749562	Yeah.
750943	753065	And you'll buy it, because you're a consumer whore.
755347	755927	And how?
757809	763393	Actually, they're talking about the original DS being marked down a couple bucks, and this one's probably going to be about $120, so...
765416	769077	It's supposed to be released in March for Japan.
769377	777080	No word on the US, but of course I'm sure it's going to hit us at some point in multiple colors and all that wonderful stuff.
779401	780662	How long before Jamie buys one?
780682	783503	Because she bought a micro, or acquired one somehow.
784143	786504	So she's got to get a light to match it, right?
786524	789705	Are they going to put out the light in soulless black for DarkSakura?
789765	790165	Possibly.
793769	795830	and also as a brighter screen, so.
796371	796711	Oh, really?
797231	797391	Yeah.
797431	800393	So I can use it to light the hallway in my darkened house.
803395	806136	Alright, so wait, then this thing will still play advanced games, right?
806176	807217	Not just DS, but advanced?
807517	807757	Yeah.
807777	808738	We're not losing any of that?
809138	809898	No, you're not losing anything.
809918	810779	It's just a little bit thinner.
811039	814201	And a white stylus to match the white virtual pure DS.
814261	814981	White stylus.
815522	823046	One of the things they said that possibly will come with it is an actual card that will go into the Game Boy Advance slot so that, you know,
823717	824738	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
853703	856705	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
883117	886138	They have to sell another one to every Japanese person now, so the only way to do that?
887378	889399	What, make them smaller?
889539	905965	We had the Game Boy, then the Game Boy Pocket, then the Game Boy Pocket Color, then the Game Boy SP, then the Virtual Boy, which we all forget about, then we had the Game Boy DS, and we had the Game Boy Advance, and then we had those like me who had lights installed in it.
906265	909926	Also, the other reason why they have it white is to also set
910376	914517	Some more conspiracy theories on how Nintendo and Apple would be working together.
914577	918559	Oh yeah, that's a lot of feedback I've been reading is that they're trying to make DS's look like iPods.
923080	924101	I'm not touching that one.
924981	925861	I know.
925981	927302	There's so many things.
927342	929422	You've gotten enough hate mail in the past couple weeks.
931063	932403	I only got one letter actually.
933004	933304	Whatever.
933984	934144	Yeah.
935976	938057	So does anybody in here think they'll buy one?
938337	938617	I will.
938777	939017	Why?
939637	945380	Because I'm a Nintendo fanboy, and I buy at least one version of every system they come out with.
945680	950081	When the SP came out, I bought a blue one, and when they had the red one come out, I also bought the red one.
950101	951542	That's right, I forgot about that.
951602	952262	That's sad.
952362	958965	Yeah, and when we were at the store the other day, I almost bought that Mario Kart DS, or the DS bundle, because it was the red DS.
958985	960165	I don't have a red DS yet.
960956	962396	So, I'll buy one.
962476	965077	Are you going to buy a white DS and make it back when a blue one comes out?
965177	968918	Well, they said that there's going to be a few colors for the Japanese launch.
968958	970778	I'll wait to see if there's something beyond white.
970958	972678	If there's a blue one, I will get a blue one.
972878	978680	If there's a white one, I guess I'll just get the white one if any other crappy colors come out, like yellow or something.
978720	981040	It all depends when they come out and what the price set.
981340	986041	I mean, I'm probably not going to go trade in my DS for a new DS because that would just be retarded, but
987982	991663	On top of that, isn't your Animal Crossing Village dependent on your game?
992184	992624	On your system?
993704	994444	Your friend code is.
995425	997625	Well, friend code, yeah, but I don't think so.
997765	1003607	Yeah, I'm not sure how that would screw it all up if you try to take your... Because it does say something about the cartridge is linked to the system.
1004868	1005328	Eh, who cares.
1007989	1016652	I honestly... I think I'll get one, but that's just for the convenience of it being smaller and not having enough room in my purse.
1016957	1019299	And I like the extra backlighting features.
1019359	1020380	That's kind of cool.
1020700	1027066	Not that the games are dark right now, but they could pull another Castlevania like they did on Advance and just make it impossible to see.
1030063	1030423	GameTap
1054341	1066937	GameTap is the program that you can use to download and play classic games such as Atari 2600 and Sega Master System games or games of more recent memory such as games in the Tomb Raider series and Prince of Persia Sands of Time.
1067437	1071683	When we reviewed the product, we had a lot of questions about the potential of this product.
1072043	1073845	Rick Sanchez, Vice President of Content for GameTap
1101668	1102849	Happy to be here.
1104129	1106330	GameTap, why was GameTap started?
1107671	1108531	A whole bunch of reasons.
1109312	1117135	I think the most important reason is that there was a guy here at Turner Broadcasting and his name is Blake Lewin who just absolutely loves video games.
1118295	1130821	At the core of GameTap, while there's a lot of business reasons to go ahead and create it, is sort of this foundation for just a real passion for games and old games, new games, all games and a belief that
1131714	1140339	A good game made a year ago, five years ago, or 20 years ago is still a good game today, and it's a shame that more people can't experience a wider variety of games.
1140419	1144922	So that was sort of the impetus for GameTap on a personal level for Blake.
1144942	1158310	And then for Turner, the idea of GameTap presented a really unique opportunity and sort of an interesting foray into a broadband product, which was there's lots of things to do with broadband out there, but to date,
1158863	1173232	No one had really gone out and just sat down and said, I'm going to make a product specifically for broadband, something that's designed to cater to a broadband audience that fills broadband users' needs and takes advantage of these wetter pipes in a sort of unique and interesting way.
1174333	1177695	And that was the Turner impetus for GameTap.
1177735	1187261	And then there was sort of just a nice game industry coincidence that is, once you release a game, you've only got one shot to put it out there, and that's it.
1187893	1217241	if it doesn't pick up in sales like in the first few weeks it's taken off shelves and no one may ever find that game again except in a bargain bin later unlike movies where movies hit the theaters and then they hit airplanes and hotels and then they hit DVD and then they hit pay cable then they hit basic cable then they hit network TV so they've got this really wonderful sort of long tail approach to all these different opportunities for people to experience the content and of course for the people who create the content to
1220070	1233348	That's very true, and a lot of games I notice on GameTap are, in some cases, so old and so classic that a lot of the teenagers and even 20-somethings probably never even played these games before, so I totally can see where you're coming from.
1233368	1234789	It's like a whole new life for the games.
1235546	1235906	Exactly.
1236687	1241811	And, you know, not just the old ones, but there's two titles we have, really, that have just really done phenomenally for us.
1242011	1244432	One of them is, they're both Ubisoft titles, incidentally.
1245053	1248355	One of them is Beyond Good and Evil, and the other is Prince of Persia Sands of Time.
1249676	1250877	Yeah, I checked out Sands of Time.
1251678	1256541	Yeah, they're both phenomenal games, but neither one of them really sold all that well for a variety of reasons.
1257982	1264487	You know, when Beyond Good and Evil came out, it came out during a holiday season packed with a lot of other franchise games.
1265748	1269910	and it was sort of a unique new game, sort of different.
1269970	1281376	I didn't immediately find an audience, but on GameTap it's consistently a game that people keep discovering and playing more and more all the time, despite the fact that it didn't really sell that well.
1281997	1289261	And then Sands of Time is another really fantastic game, really well-reviewed when it came out, but it shipped a little late in the holiday season.
1290581	1293663	It came out when there was a ton of other games in the market
1294401	1301446	and so I didn't find an audience for that, you know, that first sort of new revamp of the Ubisoft, of the Prince of Persia franchise.
1301987	1303828	But on GameTap, you know, it's doing GameBusters.
1304248	1309392	I totally agree because I never checked out Sands of Time when it first came out just because there was so much.
1309412	1311854	I remember what you said, when it came out it was a very busy holiday season.
1311874	1319019	I never checked it out and I finally got a chance to play it through GameTap myself a couple weeks ago and, you know, I see where the critics really enjoyed this game.
1319059	1320340	It's a really great, great title.
1321221	1321801	Right, yeah, it's...
1322870	1323190	and so on.
1346636	1346796	Sure.
1347076	1358699	Well, I can come up with a bunch of reasons, but if it were me and I didn't actually work here and I was looking, how am I going to spend my gaming dollars, there's a few things about game titles that would really sort of drive home the value for it for me.
1358939	1361120	One of them is just the sheer breadth of titles that we have.
1362640	1365161	We've got now over 365 games in the system.
1365561	1367962	We're adding between four and six a week right now.
1368822	1372943	And the games cover everything from the granddaddy of video games, Pong,
1374180	1397499	and Beyond Good and Evil and some of the Splinter Cell games so as a consumer there's just no way that I can afford to buy every game I might want to play but for a monthly fee I can try a lot of games that maybe I was on the fence about spending money on and I can play them as much as I want or not play them at all so there's no sort of
1399128	1403670	Lost Value for me if I try a game, don't really like it, and move on to something else.
1403970	1406050	I went out and spent $50 on something that I didn't like.
1406470	1409371	I think the value of it is pretty big.
1409691	1412952	That kind of relates to something I think I was reading on the website or something about.
1413152	1419334	There was a good comparison to the fact that folks pay $14.95 a month for certain MMOs, and that's just for one game.
1420054	1420894	Exactly, exactly.
1421194	1423335	Like I said, we're launching more all the time.
1423375	1426956	Just purely from that perspective, I think there's a value to us.
1427389	1440675	and then the other thing is, you know, one of the things that we do, especially with the older games we have is, you know, we really take the time and put in the energy to make these games run the way that the original creators wanted them to run.
1440755	1446717	So, you know, anybody can go out, download some emulation software, find some illegal ROMs and play a lot of these games.
1447238	1455781	But the difference between, you know, that experience and the experience in GameTap is that, you know, we went directly to the publishers that, is this game running the way it's supposed to?
1455961	1457062	And they gave us feedback like,
1457681	1458922	That color blue is a little bit off.
1458942	1459583	Can you fix that?
1459983	1461424	It's running just a little bit too fast.
1461464	1462265	Can you slow it down?
1463686	1465748	There's this glitch that shouldn't be in there.
1465768	1466428	Can you fix that?
1466468	1469330	So we're sort of remastering these games for a new generation.
1469831	1473274	When you get the game in GameTap, you're getting it the way it's supposed to be played.
1474555	1477597	You're getting it the way the publishers want the game to be experienced.
1477898	1478499	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1503251	1503591	Excellent.
1503791	1505572	I think that's important.
1505592	1510294	And then a lot of these games, even if you wanted to try and run them in an emulator, you may not be able to.
1510934	1515516	So we have a bunch of DOS games in our service that honestly are kind of hard to get to run in any capacity.
1517657	1518138	That's true.
1518158	1520279	Of course, there's the Dreamcast titles that we have.
1520999	1521959	We've got three up now.
1522159	1524981	The Dreamcast as a platform is incredibly difficult to emulate.
1525021	1528022	It's one of those tiny, complex things we've undertaken.
1529062	1532704	We were going to put a lot more Dreamcast titles out this year, but where else can you
1533567	1533967	Dreamcast Games
1562251	1577211	we're going in, we're figuring out what do we have to do to our DOS emulator to make this game run right and then we're doing that work so there's a big difference between just taking some DOS files, running it through a free DOS emulator and the experience you get with us
1578035	1578715	All right, awesome.
1578775	1585579	Now, I noticed that GameTap is constantly rolling out patches and features and new interface things.
1586179	1599085	And one thing, when I initially was reviewing GameTap on the show, I kind of thought, gee, it would be really great if one day we could have a multiplayer element in this, especially when I see the leaderboards and the competition a little bit there.
1599785	1604928	Is that a possibility for the future, multiplayer or other type of interactive features with the system?
1605936	1607997	Well, the simple answer is yes.
1610418	1615820	The more complex answer is, I can't tell you too much about it right now, but multiplayer is something that we think is really important.
1618121	1633267	Almost every game in our system has some component of multiplayer built into it, whether or not it's sitting next to somebody and you play together, or some of our PC titles which we're designed to run over the internet, peer-to-peer IP playing.
1635328	1635488	So
1636843	1638145	Multiplayer is very important to us.
1638185	1639446	It's something we're working very hard on.
1639947	1647096	And when we do have it, you'll find that it's something that's more than, I hope, what some people might have expected out of multiplayer.
1648130	1648651	All right, excellent.
1648671	1649912	We can't go into any more details than that.
1650272	1651853	All right, well, we'll take that.
1651913	1653535	It's a little hint of something to come.
1654735	1658118	We've been talking a little bit about the games as they're rolled out.
1658158	1666425	You release new games every week, and I've seen articles in the press lately about GameTap getting licenses with these other game companies.
1666765	1670668	How does GameTap choose the games that will actually be included in the library?
1671569	1671769	Right.
1672089	1676493	Well, right now, we've got a lot of games under license, more than we have in the system, obviously.
1677739	1689765	The way that we try to figure out which games that we have under license are going to go into the system is a combination of taking a look at sort of the value of any individual game and saying, when's the best time to plug this into the system?
1689845	1697028	So, Santa Time, for example, we wanted to put into this system to coincide with the launch of Two Thrones.
1697609	1698849	And we did a big lead-up to it.
1698889	1702391	So we put in Prince of Persia 1, Prince of Persia 2, the original Jordan Mechner games.
1702831	1706393	We did a big video retrospective on the entire Prince of Persia series.
1706960	1715503	from Prince of Persia 1 all the way through to Thrones, and then we finally launched Santa Time as our sort of finale to that effort.
1716764	1720945	Other things that we look at doing are essentially a technical assessment.
1721745	1725447	When technically can we get this game running well enough to be able to put it into the system?
1725687	1727908	And honestly, that's probably our biggest gating factor.
1728728	1732849	A lot of the stuff we have under license is difficult to get running.
1733289	1734670	So the Dreamcast games, for example,
1735359	1739161	We have quite a few other Dreamcast games under license.
1739181	1742703	We're working very hard on getting all the emulation for each one of those games running.
1743023	1744664	It's basically a game-by-game process.
1745764	1749206	And as soon as those are ready, we're going to put them in.
1749266	1762153	So it's a combination of what do we have that's available for us to use from the publishers that said, that's it, you got it right, you can use it, combined with what else is going on in the world that makes releasing this game a good time to release it.
1762777	1763157	Excellent.
1763238	1764459	Okay, that makes sense.
1764479	1767742	You want to make sure that you're putting it out right and not just doing something rushed.
1767762	1769403	That's very important, absolutely.
1770064	1773346	And then the other thing we do is we try to put out big packages together.
1773387	1776289	So we rolled out the Heroes of Might and Magic series as a series.
1777330	1781994	But we had to wait for one of the games to get finished, one of the old DOS games we had some trouble getting running.
1782635	1786778	So we held all the other Heroes of Might and Magic games until we could get that one final game fixed.
1786798	1789561	Then we released the whole thing as a big, giant stunt where...
1790120	1792595	You can play the entire Heroes of Might and Magic series.
1793567	1794387	Okay, okay.
1795128	1796628	That's another way that we pick games.
1796808	1800130	I've noticed that too, like with Space Quest 2, which is a series I've been following.
1800170	1804831	It seemed like for a few weeks there, it was kind of like, okay, here's Space Quest 5 and 3.
1805352	1808933	A new game from that series was showing up every couple weeks, which was kind of cool.
1809373	1810333	Exactly, exactly.
1810393	1810654	Excellent.
1810894	1815956	Well, I know you talked about a big push going on with Prince of Persia Sands of Time.
1816636	1820097	Are there other types of big titles that GameTap's going to be adding in the future?
1820137	1822318	Any hints that you can give us here on what's coming up?
1823052	1824733	Let's see, hints that I can give you.
1826214	1827435	Yes.
1828716	1832298	We have... What's a good franchise that's coming out?
1832498	1840643	Probably nothing as big as Sands of Time in the next couple weeks, but we do have the series Lords of the Realm coming very soon.
1841123	1842824	Okay.
1843224	1847667	A very favorite classic series that a lot of people have enjoyed.
1848508	1852070	We have another iteration of the Commandos series from
1853115	1854116	Eidos coming soon.
1854436	1854676	Okay.
1854696	1858079	What else would I want to reveal?
1858099	1861202	You know, I don't know that I'd want to reveal anything more than what I've just given you right now.
1861282	1862163	Okay, that's fine.
1862223	1862543	That's fine.
1862583	1863564	We've got to keep some secrets.
1863584	1863984	That's fine.
1864685	1866146	I've got to keep a few things in my back pocket.
1866166	1868088	I already gave you the multiplayer hint.
1868188	1868768	All right, all right.
1869349	1869829	We'll take it.
1870645	1883013	Now, one thing, okay, going to a completely different topic, because I know that GameTap is a little more than just the games, because when we originally reviewed GameTap on this program, we noticed the MediaPlex right away.
1883053	1892499	We noticed this section of the software, and there's basically television program shorts that are kind of loaded in here that the subscribers can watch.
1892860	1895942	How are these segments chosen for broadcast?
1897042	1897443	You mean the...
1898849	1906153	The theory behind our MediaPlex is really that GameTap as a whole is a combination of games on demand and video on demand.
1907234	1909395	We're calling it a broadband network you can play kind of thing.
1910396	1921822	It's sort of a new creature that lives online that takes things from internet, takes things from broadcast, from a lot of different entertainment disciplines and puts them together into a broadband package.
1921862	1926185	So the MediaPlex is our linear video programming side of the equation.
1927149	1931631	and in there we're trying to create sort of a TV network for the internet.
1932491	1934292	TV networks, they're very linear.
1934412	1940674	You don't have a lot of control over them unless you own a TV or a replay TV or some kind of other digital recording device.
1941955	1952519	With our television offering, what we've got now and what I can tell you we're moving more towards is true video on demand where all of our programming is put in a place where you can decide what you want to watch, when you want to watch it, how you want to watch it.
1953206	1957868	We create series based primarily on what we think our audience is interested in.
1959649	1961490	We have a series called Tapped In.
1961570	1966133	It's a behind-the-scenes, did-you-know, magazine-style show.
1966173	1968454	One of my favorite episodes is about the Rayman franchise.
1969194	1972676	What most people don't know about Rayman is that it was originally created by a teenager in France.
1973537	1981581	The reason he has no arms and legs is because when they were animating him, the arms and legs just made the animation too choppy on the hardware at the time.
1982352	1991058	So to keep the animation as fluid as possible, they just erased the arms and legs and they created this very iconic character who is still showing up in video games today.
1991958	2000204	So we've got a program like that that is designed to provide sort of an informative look at games with a nice entertainment spin.
2001165	2006328	And then we have Space Ghost, which is my favorite interviewer of all time.
2007229	2009130	As with a lot of people, feel very similar.
2010451	2012092	And with that, we want to bring
2013556	2014176	and so on and so forth.
2036460	2046422	Exactly, so that's our take there, that we wanted to bring a different perspective to interviewing to the game industry, and that's why Space Coast made the leap from broadcast to broadband.
2049123	2049463	Excellent.
2049983	2060666	And then other programming we picked to highlight some of the games in our system, and then other programming is really designed to sort of fill the entertainment needs of people who are interested in games.
2063527	2065247	Our goal with MediaPlex is to provide
2065973	2069604	Really interesting content that if you like games, you might also enjoy.
2071228	2071529	Excellent.
2071549	2073074	Think of it as gaming lifestyle television.
2073908	2082511	Now, I have to go here because I went here when I initially reviewed GameTap on this program, and you brought up something that was very interesting in the last segment.
2082531	2086432	You said nobody can do interviews, and you mentioned some other television stations right there.
2086833	2093415	Now, I noticed that GameTap is owned by Turner Broadcasting, who owns various over-cable television networks.
2093895	2095236	Some gamers feel...
2096876	2103039	Some gamers feel very underrepresented right now by what's on gaming television, so to speak.
2103579	2114104	Is there a possibility of crossing over onto Turner's other properties, like the GameTap show on TBS, so folks over cable can feel represented again?
2116625	2118026	You can always say there's a possibility.
2119386	2121067	I don't have anything like that planned right now.
2121127	2123248	Our focus is really on broadband.
2123688	2124609	We really believe that
2126809	2135272	Gamers as a group, people who may not consider themselves gamers but enjoy games, they're moving increasingly to broadband as a platform.
2135292	2136613	They're moving away from television.
2137133	2142955	They're digesting information in a more sort of piece-by-piece kind of way.
2143036	2151939	So instead of sitting back and watching a half hour of programming about games, they're more interested in, I want to see this and I want to see that, but I don't want to see the rest.
2153020	2156501	So from our perspective, it's a much more compelling
2157645	2167550	Content Offering, and also a much more compelling way to represent our audience to deliver our message and our content through the broadband medium rather than television.
2168451	2180097	You know, one thing I've got to say I like about the way it's set up, too, that, you know, standard over cable networks wouldn't be able to provide is that, you know, when GameTap's featuring a game in one of the programs, I could click a couple buttons and then be playing that game.
2180957	2181778	Exactly, exactly.
2181798	2183639	And you'll see a lot more of that over the next few months.
2184119	2184459	Excellent.
2184815	2204445	Now, to kind of go into a different topic here, with GameTap kind of tapping into these retro games as well as some of the newer titles as well, and this whole push towards a broadband center, basically, is it possible one day that GameTap could maybe leave the computer and become something that you plug right into the TV?
2204485	2208927	Because I think about retro gaming is very popular with those little joysticks you can plug into the TV.
2209127	2212249	Could GameTap be a console one day that you plug right into television?
2214369	2214669	and so on.
2235497	2240179	a decent Vive system hooked up to a TV and you've got GameTap as a platform running on your big screen.
2241259	2250002	So it's not so far-fetched, but I don't know that we would want to necessarily work within the confines of one of those joysticks you plug into a TV for a variety of reasons.
2250082	2262386	One of them being if you added up the total volume, disk space volume of all the games we have in our library, you'd have to have a lot of hard drives to plug into your TV to get the GameTap experience.
2262634	2263375	Okay, that's fair.
2263775	2264075	All right.
2264095	2273821	And then, you know, divorcing the video from GameTap, which you'd have to do in one of those things, but also, you know, it would sort of, it would make GameTap a lot less than it is today.
2275182	2275422	Okay.
2276083	2276323	Okay.
2278044	2290412	My last question I have for you today is, is subscription and download-based gaming the future of gaming, as you see it, or is it just another thing that can complement the consoles, the CDs that we have now?
2291032	2291152	Right.
2292101	2296104	I don't think digital delivery is going to replace physical delivery.
2296565	2301468	I think it's going to be a great complement to physical delivery for a lot of reasons.
2301588	2317800	One of them is if you take a look at the latest generation of consoles coming out and the sheer quantity of data that has to fit on one of those disks for those games, physical storage is still outpacing the ability of broadband pipes to deliver that much data that quickly.
2317880	2318020	So
2318726	2322427	Our biggest games on GameTap still take 15, sometimes 20 minutes to download.
2323187	2334370	And if you've got a slow connection, and I use slow as a relative term, like a DSL connection, it might take even longer versus, you know, a CD, you pop it in, you're ready to go.
2336010	2347093	One of the things we do to make downloading less of a task is on GameTap you can play a smaller game like Pac-Man while you're downloading Splinter Cell.
2348234	2350236	Digital Delivery Replacing Physical Delivery in the Next 5-10 Years
2370891	2371952	Okay, excellent.
2371992	2377195	Well, Rick Sanchez, Vice President of Content with GameTap, thank you so much for being on the show this week.
2377235	2378135	We really appreciate it.
2379216	2379836	No, you're welcome.
2379856	2380256	I enjoyed it.
2380457	2382278	Is there anything else you wanted to share with our listeners?
2383839	2384879	What would I share with your listeners?
2385059	2386920	Well, we've got some very good Space Ghosts coming up.
2387000	2388641	If you haven't already tuned in, you should.
2388941	2393444	We recently did a Space Ghost with Alcorn, the guy who created Pong.
2393664	2395605	Very, very funny if you're a fan of the series.
2396386	2396706	All right.
2397251	2400233	www.gametap.com if you want to check it out.
2400293	2401493	Thanks again, Rick, for being here.
2401553	2402354	Really appreciate it.
2403494	2407616	And hope to have you on the show again sometime, especially when you get that multiplayer.
2407897	2408337	Wink, wink.
2408617	2408857	Okay.
2409317	2409637	All right.
2413660	2414020	All right.
2414360	2415360	That was pretty informative.
2415741	2416121	Like that.
2416441	2416961	Very cool.
2417221	2417822	Multiplayer.
2418982	2419783	Sounds exciting.
2420123	2420443	All right.
2421172	2423754	Well, thank you very much again to Rick for being here on the program this week.
2423794	2424774	We really appreciate it.
2424934	2428256	And looking forward to those new things coming on GameTap in the future.
2429497	2429797	All right.
2430338	2431058	Let's move on.
2431138	2435361	Talk about something going on with a traditional console-style game.
2436281	2442245	Now, you noticed in that interview, Rick talked a lot about they try to make the games perfect and authentic and like the originals.
2442745	2445387	Well, sometimes the original games are flawed a little bit, aren't they?
2445747	2446007	Yes.
2446248	2448329	Such is the case with Animal Crossing, right, Jamie?
2448349	2448409	Yes.
2448809	2452532	Well, there's actually a teensy little bitty hack that is going out.
2452773	2464282	Well, it's not really determined if it's a hack or just a glitch, but basically you'll receive a letter that says YYGH with a return signal or something to that effect that has a red tulip in it.
2465063	2469127	Now, this red tulip is special because you can plant it anywhere.
2470406	2492923	and I don't just mean you know anywhere you could plant it on pavement pull it up and then plant a tree there or you can also plant it in your house however planting it in your house is kind of crappy because once you plant it the space goes invisible you cannot put anything there you cannot move it you can't do anything basically the block of space that takes up is a dead space
2494335	2499462	So, Nintendo has put out something to say about this.
2500583	2506291	Basically saying that, you know, basically just what I said, you'll lose that space on your floor.
2506751	2511037	It tells you, you know what it does, it says basically you don't want to drop the item in your house or outside your house.
2511935	2515236	and if you happen to, make sure you do not save your game.
2515296	2518217	Reset and face the wrath of Mr. Resetti.
2518237	2520477	I was going to say, and face the wrath of Mr. Resetti.
2520517	2521397	I don't know what's worse.
2521457	2522838	Yeah, for 15 minutes.
2523118	2526879	Well, what it actually ended up being is there was going to be another one of those letters.
2527019	2529119	Remember how they have the coin that came out a while back?
2529319	2529799	Right, I figured.
2529879	2531100	It went out unfinished.
2531260	2538821	And so when it got sent out, because the letter was from Nintendo itself, and so now this is going out and everyone's like, oh crap.
2538841	2539642	Someone just got fired.
2539922	2540842	Someone just got fired.
2543323	2544564	I want a special red tulip.
2544684	2546185	You know, I actually haven't checked my game today.
2546225	2546926	I probably should.
2546946	2548847	The special red tulip.
2549187	2550268	I did not have mine.
2550348	2552530	I checked and I went on Wi-Fi and nothing.
2553130	2555492	It must have been on there for only a very short period of time.
2556412	2561816	It actually, you know, to go and say it was actually confirmed via conversation by calling Nintendo's helpline.
2562828	2567672	Also, there's another bit of issue going out with Animal Crossing Wild World.
2569833	2578840	There are people who have basically revealed that their games have fallen prey to hackers who managed to remove the gates of the villages they visit.
2580121	2583764	Gamers are trapped offline if they've saved after the hack has taken place.
2584505	2585165	Yeah, I heard about this.
2585185	2588668	It's something like it jinxes your gate into a museum or something.
2590081	2594605	I don't know, it'll totally make your gate disappear and turn it into something else, so it's gone.
2595746	2603292	But it's really a crappy thing to happen, to have your game just messed with like that.
2603372	2614261	I mean, I don't see... It just goes to show there's people who try to pull crap because they can, without any regard to anybody but themselves.
2614582	2616163	Be careful who you give your friend codes out to.
2617013	2628381	and if we see somebody on the Orange Lounge friend code thread doing this stuff we will publicly embarrass you we will send you many red tulips of death and then some and publicly embarrass you that's right
2629790	2630450	Not in a good way.
2631091	2633291	Gamers all over the world will know your name.
2633311	2634912	We're talking Wedgie from the Flagpole.
2635312	2636112	Oh, yeah.
2636572	2636893	All right.
2638293	2638973	With barbed wire.
2639333	2640974	Thank you for that lovely warning.
2641314	2642515	Appreciate it.
2643415	2650717	Since we're such Animal Crossing whores on this show, apparently, I swear, have we gone one week since the game came out and not talked about it in one way or another?
2650937	2651098	No.
2651298	2651558	Sad.
2652018	2652298	All right.
2653218	2655039	Anyway, speaking of the Wrath...
2655922	2657924	Rockstar is feeling the wrath once again.
2658004	2659084	Who from this time, Loki?
2659325	2663088	This time from the city of L.A., and that's really retarded.
2663128	2665529	But anyway, some L.A.
2665549	2673716	attorney, Rocky Delag... Some guy named Rocky, okay, with a really hard-to-pronounce last name.
2674396	2685545	Not that it really matters because this case is just going to get kicked out anyways, but he believes that Rockstar is responsible for the hot coffee crap that went on
2686105	2696272	and basically it says, businesses have the obligation to truthfully disclose the content of their products, whether in the food we eat or in the entertainment we consume.
2697632	2702355	So basically, you know, he's saying, oh, the poor children that have been hurt by the game, oh.
2704045	2704926	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2728268	2733553	Assuming the fact these parents shouldn't have been buying the games for their kids because the ratings are 17 and over.
2733693	2734093	Hello?
2734614	2737957	I mean, I think they should be able to understand, oh, now there's a little bit of sex in here.
2738357	2739398	Oh, crap, you know.
2740799	2751348	The other thing, also, he's looking for penalties against Take-Two and Rockstar and has requested that the companies fully disclose the content of their games.
2752349	2754231	Probably also seeking some money as well.
2755391	2757493	You know what else might be fueling this lawsuit?
2757853	2760815	GamePolitics.com had a very interesting speculation on this.
2760835	2763036	They ran a story on this earlier this week.
2764337	2767599	This Rocky... I'll try the last name, okay, Loki?
2767899	2769700	It's Rocky Delgadillo.
2770161	2770541	How's that?
2770881	2771441	Does that sound right?
2771742	2772442	Sounds okay.
2773202	2779146	He's actually running for California Attorney General this year and will be in the June 6th primary.
2780047	2781167	So he's playing a Clinton.
2781408	2781648	Hmm.
2784178	2784558	You know what?
2784598	2791841	I hope that everyone that runs on the platform of video game violence hurting our children fails and burns in hell.
2792261	2793201	That's what I hope.
2793601	2793941	Right there.
2795222	2795582	All right.
2795722	2803064	Well, that's one of those draw your own conclusions and opinions on that political stuff.
2803825	2804545	I don't know.
2805185	2809327	I just think politicians in general are misinformed on this whole thing.
2809527	2810167	That's kind of my...
2810760	2814565	Oh, you really think that he doesn't have any idea what's going on at all?
2814965	2818369	I'm saying you don't have to be Democrat, Republican, Libertarian, Green Party.
2818409	2819310	I don't care who you are.
2819731	2822895	I think politicians in general are misinformed on this whole thing.
2823595	2823676	Or...
2824941	2829185	It may not necessarily be that they're misinformed, but they're spreading the misinformation.
2844538	2846181	And money on this crap.
2846521	2847783	Why aren't they going after them?
2847963	2849385	That's what I want to know.
2849786	2853310	There was no mention in BloodRayne at all in the beginning of the entire previews.
2853451	2855353	There was no mention that there was going to be boobies in there.
2855614	2857797	And my god, there were boobies in there!
2858416	2859817	I was totally caught off guard!
2859877	2864260	Well, what about the MPAA thing that says rated R for sexuality and all that stuff?
2864280	2867001	Oh, sexual... What the hell does sexuality mean?
2867041	2868843	I mean, because that was on Grand Theft Auto.
2868863	2870404	I didn't know they were talking about boobies.
2870464	2872305	Rated R because she might be a lesbian.
2872845	2873586	We just don't know.
2874166	2877108	And violence and stuff, but oh my god, there was boobies in there.
2877408	2878289	And this is the thing.
2878789	2880870	Why aren't they going after crappy entertainment?
2880910	2883912	Because that is more of a threat to society than these games.
2884613	2885133	You know, to go...
2886268	2891849	I don't have to put a special code in for the crap to pop up on the screen.
2892470	2893230	It's already there.
2893510	2894490	It's written in the script.
2894950	2902572	So what we need to do is we need to go after these people and stop freaking trying to blame everybody for everything.
2902972	2910194	There was another story earlier this week saying, Oh, this car crash is caused by need for Speed Most Wanted because the game has cars in it.
2910494	2912795	Therefore, the game caused the crash.
2913555	2914115	It was retarded.
2915939	2920701	Alright, you can send those cards and letters to Loki, careofmailbag at orangelaundradio.com.
2921001	2922082	I know we'll be getting lots of those.
2922302	2923742	Your rants are so entertaining.
2923802	2925643	I just sit back here and laugh and laugh.
2926143	2926623	Alright.
2927144	2933146	Well, you know, one thing, sometimes the folks that get blamed in these situations are the parents.
2934427	2939629	But are every parent these anti... I shouldn't say anti.
2940109	2943130	Is every parent completely misinformed when it comes to video games?
2943911	2944291	You know...
2945945	2946445	I'm going to
2960908	2973042	A study that's out by the Peter D. Hart Research Associates that was released by the ESA that shows that 35% of US parents play games with their children.
2973342	2977107	80% of the study group actually plays with their children and 47% of them are women.
2979076	2979617	Girl gamers!
2980477	2983100	Interesting for those folks to say, you know, girls don't play games.
2983120	2984501	47% of mommies.
2985602	2987263	It's 35% of US parents play.
2987283	2989685	I totally just distorted that statistic, but anyway.
2990306	2996131	35% of parents play, 47% of them are women, and 80% of gaming parents say they play with their children.
2996191	2996711	Okay, got it.
2997472	2997812	Okay.
2998453	3001976	Did you also know 65% of statistics are made up on the spot?
3003838	3004218	Wow!
3004398	3004739	Just kidding.
3006380	3019227	But the other interesting thing about this is that they also show with this study that 85% of voting parents, including those who do not play video games, say that parents should take responsibility for their children's exposure to the games.
3020307	3034675	The ESA president stated, I'm just going to quote, this research suggests that proposals to regulate video games may backfire with American voters who, unlike some elected officials, appear to fully understand that they should control the entertainment that comes into their homes.
3035998	3037799	There's also some more interesting statistics.
3037939	3038080	Huh.
3038120	3038380	Interesting.
3064187	3079113	So, you know, it just points out, you know, this whole crap we're seeing about games, I honestly have a feeling that we're probably going to see a dying off because we, our generation, we are the ones who grew up with the video games, aren't we?
3080173	3080493	I agree.
3081333	3082994	Not everybody, but, you know, a lot.
3083294	3084475	But most of us.
3084735	3088616	We remember when these were all new and shiny and nothing like this had ever been seen before.
3089176	3090977	You know, it's one thing to say...
3092049	3095792	The video game boom started in my lifetime, you know?
3096853	3099756	And more and more of us are going to be raised gamers.
3100176	3105040	And when they say parents play video games with their kids, they don't mean like Grand Theft Auto is what they're playing with their kids.
3105060	3110665	There's plenty of family-friendly games out there that parents can play with their kids, like the guy game.
3113115	3115317	Like a, you know, like Katamari Damacy.
3115457	3117398	That's good, clean, rolling over people fun.
3117438	3122722	Tetris and the Spongebob, the endless barrage of Spongebob games they put out on the various consoles.
3122742	3124483	Mary-Kate and Ashley Shop-a-thon.
3124803	3125263	The Winx.
3127385	3127685	Alright.
3129406	3130007	Ha ha ha.
3131857	3133358	GameWriters Conference
3152768	3157851	that actually took place in Austin last October.
3158071	3160972	Will they be actually teaching people how to write for games?
3161052	3162753	Because some of them need some bad help.
3162993	3164773	Some of them are doing okay, but some of them need some help.
3164874	3179720	It actually does specifically state here that games were not so much written as put together by the programmers and the artists involved, but a lot more publishers are actually looking to have writing behind the games, good solid writing,
3180260	3184701	Just like you would for a movie, you know, or like a television production.
3185061	3187902	You can't have a story without someone to write it, right?
3189042	3189642	True, true.
3190922	3203305	So, you know, there's also involvement then with this from the Writers Guild of America that started its new media caucus to bring new writers in.
3204245	3205445	Let's see, I've got a name on here.
3205605	3207866	There's the author of three James Bond screenplays.
3208513	3208794	DarkSakura,
3217910	3222993	There's actually a pretty good quote in here from the guild president, Patrick Varan is his name.
3223873	3227275	Game players are becoming more sophisticated in terms of their expectations.
3227695	3233519	At the same time, the publishers are making licensing deals, many of which require quality storytelling to be built into the games.
3234059	3237121	As you know, storytelling and character development don't just fall out of the sky.
3237161	3239002	They actually have to be written by creative talent.
3240502	3243304	What do you think would be the difference between game writing and movie writing?
3243996	3244756	Not too much, really.
3245136	3252079	Because think about this, a lot more games, especially the more cinematic the game, have full storyboards made for them.
3252659	3263043	I mean, scripted, you have to have dialogue scripted for any, you know, it was one thing back when we were all pixel games, you could say, sorry Mario, our princess is in another castle.
3263726	3269170	But it's another thing now to have full-blown conversations between characters, full-on dialogue.
3269671	3273694	You have to have someone sit back and write exactly how everything's going to pan out.
3274194	3282761	Especially, say you have a game where you've got multi-directions, you have to be able to write on multiple paths.
3282801	3284262	You can't just say, oh, here's a game.
3285263	3287144	You have to know where you're going to go.
3287384	3289226	They're as much of a story as reading a book.
3289246	3290967	All right.
3291680	3294462	I think that I have decided that that's what I want to do when I grow up.
3294982	3295222	Really?
3296163	3296603	Write for games?
3296843	3301066	Well, you know, I'm actually in school to do, because part of what I want to do is manuals.
3302067	3304688	So will you write a game and then we can give it a negative review on the show?
3304988	3305109	No.
3305129	3305689	I'm just teasing.
3305929	3307690	Anything that I do is instantly fabulous.
3308070	3308311	All right.
3308511	3309992	I'm reading some feedback from the chat room.
3310012	3313093	The chat room is actually still responding to the last story about the parents and the video games.
3313834	3316436	Toasty says his mom played Shenmue.
3317416	3318617	Remember that one on the Dreamcast?
3318637	3318717	Yeah.
3319529	3321229	We played the heck out of Shenmue.
3348973	3349473	You know what?
3351194	3351435	Nothing.
3374619	3375360	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3396852	3398632	Other than a lot of electrocutions.
3399393	3399733	Not much.
3400473	3405514	Anyways, we've got yet another politician running on a stupid platform that has to do with video games.
3405574	3407815	And this one's just completely retarded.
3408855	3413536	First off, you can visit this guy, Starlock, which is also a really dumb name.
3414736	3418077	His website, which I'm going to read the motto off the top of the page.
3418397	3420418	As for me and my house, we serve the Lord.
3420838	3426339	To give you an idea of what his views are on violent video games and anything else that might be bad for you.
3427110	3433018	To start off, his platform is he wants to propose a $10,000 per abortion tax for medical clinics.
3433359	3438306	He also wants to eliminate property taxes, of course, financing all the other tax revenue via these.
3438886	3444214	But the main one, of course, is 100% tax on any violent video game.
3445418	3446559	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3464964	3474498	and also a 50% grease tax on all food prepared by deep frying or cooking in any form of oil or grease there will also be a 75% tax on fun this
3479469	3491560	And this is another guy who probably won't... I mean, granted, even if you don't agree with the whole video game 100% tax or whatever, or even if you do agree with that, you're probably not going to agree with half the other stuff that he has on here.
3491580	3492941	You know, bad food and everything.
3492981	3493922	Somebody agrees with him.
3493942	3494703	He's a politician.
3494763	3495624	Somebody voted for him.
3497325	3497766	Honestly...
3499691	3502633	This actually isn't the first time I've heard about the food specific one.
3503293	3509757	And part of me agrees with it because honestly I do think that those industries need to be penalized for basically poisoning our country.
3510998	3513739	I mean this in all seriousness.
3513859	3516941	You've noticed that obesity is on the rise among Americans.
3517441	3519242	It's epidemic.
3519543	3520823	I mean seriously it's horrible.
3521964	3523645	So I actually sort of support that.
3524312	3525853	You know the tax on sugar.
3526013	3526873	But to that extreme.
3527473	3535956	However, keep in mind that the fast food industry also lobbies heavily and pays the government a lot of money to stay in business.
3536196	3539937	I wonder what the property tax is on this guy's giant ranch he probably has.
3540557	3545038	Oh, maybe that's why he wants to remove property tax and tax all these things he probably doesn't have anything to do.
3545058	3546439	I mean, who's going to...
3548788	3549949	I really don't get it.
3566683	3567584	That ain't gonna fly.
3567684	3571386	It comes back to where's the definition of violent game?
3571426	3574688	We have these politicians that are flinging about the term violent video game.
3575068	3576229	Where's the definition?
3577089	3582272	What is the impartial party that makes a call on what constitutes a violent video game and what doesn't?
3583250	3585471	It's too gray for me.
3585671	3591934	That's what I don't like about these laws is that violent video game is not like the buzzword in the political world.
3592074	3592735	Don't worry though.
3592875	3597797	For determining whether games are going to be violent or not, he's got that covered.
3597817	3605201	He's going to have a 10-person panel that's going to help determine which games are violent.
3607702	3611364	The tax itself will be levied against publishers of said games.
3613025	3614446	Okay, so a 10-person panel.
3614726	3615787	Who goes on that panel?
3615827	3616988	Who audits that panel?
3617388	3618609	What if the panel's getting paid off?
3619949	3621730	Where's the checks and balances here?
3622451	3622771	I don't know.
3623051	3626553	It still seems too simple of a solution to a more complicated problem.
3627214	3628114	I think it's perfect.
3628314	3630596	I think his solution's flawless.
3630636	3637440	I mean, I don't see any flaw with his theory on being able to squeeze money out of the publishers.
3637840	3639601	Of course, that's going to fly.
3641052	3648834	I'm sure his interests are really on the good of humanity and not like some other third party interest like oil or something like that.
3650795	3652475	All the greatest politicians come out of Texas.
3652495	3653216	You have to understand that.
3653536	3653956	Let's see.
3656076	3659737	HitStun wants to ask, what is it with the rest of the U.S.
3659777	3661958	and its obsession with dumb laws and lawsuits?
3663679	3668600	Fireboma says, some politician wanted to do the junk food tax in New York City and got shot down.
3670467	3673952	Also in chat, Xander C says, I love Texas.
3674733	3677717	The politics suck, but the residents are actually really cool.
3678158	3678478	I agree.
3678719	3681683	I know some very wonderful people from Texas.
3681703	3682064	That's right.
3682204	3684687	And the old radio show I used to do, they're in Texas now.
3686105	3686425	Good time.
3686485	3688446	You know what I think they should do as far as the food?
3688486	3689827	And I've heard this suggestion brought up.
3689867	3704834	They should actually subsidize the cost of fresh produce for low-income families because actually the ones who actually support the industry most of all statistically are shown to be people of low-income families because honestly, it's cheap food.
3706755	3710397	And actually, if this is going to... You know what they adhere McDonald's meat with?
3712518	3713458	Shall I gross everyone out?
3713918	3714279	Why not?
3714539	3715119	Cow eyeballs.
3716334	3716474	Ew.
3716834	3717574	It's still beef.
3718295	3718895	Or beefy.
3721175	3721616	Alright.
3722676	3723616	Alright, let's move on.
3723636	3725036	From sitting there, I thought you were going to say tofu.
3725096	3725957	I was really scared.
3726857	3729058	Let's bring it back to games here for a little bit.
3729158	3736760	Let's move on over to what's going on with the E3 Expo and what could possibly be another politically motivated event.
3737020	3737460	I don't know.
3737780	3738080	Jamie?
3738100	3738200	Jamie?
3738533	3744054	Well, you know, a lot of the guys go to E3 for the games.
3744715	3745335	Uh-huh, I do.
3745355	3747735	Some go for the special presentations.
3748035	3749556	I'd say that's a good part of it, too.
3749736	3752597	A good number of the average goer goes to see scantily clad women.
3753577	3754177	Guess what?
3754237	3754777	You lose!
3756658	3757058	How so?
3757838	3765340	That is because the video game industry recently got the big ol' kick in the butt from federal and local politicians who want to limit...
3766084	3795312	The sales of violent and sexually explicit games to minors Therefore, there is a new ban Coming from the Entertainment Software Association Who is the promoter of E3 Says materials including live models Conduct that is sexually explicit and or sexually provocative Including but not limited to nudity, partial nudity, and bathing suit bottoms Are prohibited from the show floor, all common areas, and at any access points to the show However, faking orgasms is okay
3796061	3797002	which I will do in public.
3798003	3798463	Oh really?
3798844	3799364	Oh really?
3800405	3802847	I think we just got that on record here.
3804469	3806531	Stay tuned to E3 Thursday edition.
3806791	3807331	I was lying.
3808072	3809013	Jamie will be at Konami.
3809033	3809734	There's more!
3811027	3811287	Yes.
3812067	3815869	Exhibitors will receive a verbal warning when they violate this rule.
3816149	3821251	A second violation says they'll impose a $5,000 penalty payable immediately.
3822592	3827374	This would also require that the models comply with the dress code before returning to the floor.
3829715	3831936	And what happens if you're not able to pay the $5,000 fee?
3832196	3832996	I guess you're out.
3833457	3834357	I guess they shut you down.
3834377	3835918	I haven't seen anything specific like that.
3835938	3837518	What happens if they're not on the floor?
3837678	3838699	They could be swinging.
3840009	3841352	What if they're walking around outside the building?
3841372	3846865	Floor in general, as in floor as in defined as the presentation area.
3847346	3849651	Now, if they're in the bathroom, I don't think that's a problem.
3851055	3855157	Go see the new booth for Rockstar Games in the men's bathroom.
3855217	3855738	That's fine.
3855778	3859079	They'll just be scantily clad models outside of E3.
3860140	3860340	Ah!
3860840	3864082	Now, I actually read somewhere in some story that was a follow-up to this.
3864202	3869905	It's not really a new rule, but that they've dug up this rule that was all... They say it was always there.
3869985	3873007	We're just, you know, we're restating our enforcement policy.
3873047	3877029	Is that like those laws where it's illegal to tie up an alligator to a...
3877529	3878990	It's hard not to after eating Taco Bell.
3906272	3908975	We're going to get some hate mail from the fast food industry tonight.
3909316	3912059	Anyway, trying to keep things moving here.
3912459	3914241	Good idea, bad idea, who cares what?
3915223	3916985	I think it's stupid.
3917245	3920028	Once again, do they actually pay attention to the rules?
3920088	3921190	Have they read the rules?
3921250	3924894	Because last time I checked, you know, they're trying not to, you know,
3926610	3929312	Expose minors to nudity and violence and stuff.
3930093	3932455	There are no minors that attend E3.
3932835	3934516	It's 18 and over, dumbasses.
3934917	3935457	What the hell?
3935597	3936998	I mean, who cares?
3937398	3937879	So what?
3937899	3938840	They're partially nude.
3938860	3940561	They're portraying game people.
3940581	3941722	They get people to booths.
3942362	3942863	That's all.
3943083	3945285	I mean, I don't understand what the big deal is.
3946265	3949288	Why are they getting all their panties in a bunch over something stupid like this?
3949528	3951069	Are they hurting that bad for money?
3951089	3953711	Actually, they won't be able to get their panties in a bunch because they can't wear those.
3953811	3954211	They have to...
3955072	3956653	has to be granny panties but covered.
3956933	3957233	Fine!
3957533	3961415	I hope they have some really fucking skin-tight shit because that's what's going to happen.
3961695	3964416	They can be covered, but it's going to be showing everything.
3964997	3966377	So, I don't know.
3966417	3967858	I think it's really stupid, the rule.
3967958	3971900	I mean, I understand, you know, people are always saying, oh, they're victimized.
3973100	3975561	Whatever, you know, people go for the booth babes.
3975881	3977462	No, no one goes for the booth babes.
3977482	3978403	They go to see the games.
3978423	3979923	The booth babes are just an added bonus.
3979983	3983745	It's like getting, you know, free curly fries with your, you know,
3984309	3988834	MiniMe2831 says, If you want a bunch of scantily clad women, go to the Scantily Clad Women Expo.
3988854	3989915	You want games?
3989935	3990095	Go to E3.
4008422	4009323	Loki, rebuttal?
4037702	4041424	Yeah, that won't stop G4 from having 400 billion interns there.
4041444	4042805	Yeah, but they're not doing video games anymore.
4042825	4043566	I mean, haven't you noticed?
4044586	4046087	Moving on, other feedback from the chatroom.
4046107	4047948	Tomo-kun says, where are the booth studs?
4048669	4049489	Where are the booth studs?
4050310	4051831	Jamie, where were the booth studs at E3?
4052411	4053472	They were usually in the hallway.
4057935	4058175	Okay.
4058795	4058935	Well...
4061058	4065480	We'll see what happens with this as it develops and how folks get creative at E3 this year.
4066020	4066500	You know what, though?
4066560	4068141	Honestly, I don't think it's going to be that much different.
4068181	4069902	You're still going to see sexy women walking around.
4069942	4074103	It's just that they won't be wearing anything too revealing.
4074123	4076084	You know what I mean?
4076584	4080406	Those Hooters outfits are still pretty covering, but they show off everything that needs to be seen.
4080566	4083347	I don't think much will change.
4084591	4085872	I think it's getting blown out of proportion.
4085892	4093278	I think the reasons though, their excuses, oh, it's because the hot coffee, everyone's blaming goddamn Rockstar for everything.
4094058	4094719	It's retarded.
4094899	4096760	Are booth babes appropriate at a gaming expo?
4097061	4097361	Yes!
4098061	4099863	They have booth babes at car shows.
4100243	4102365	They have booth babes probably at computer shows.
4103905	4106546	It's kind of a thing that you do at expos.
4106586	4109326	They have scantily clad women at anime conventions.
4109346	4111486	Yeah, they're the cosplayers.
4111526	4115807	Granted, they may not look as nice as these models, but they do have them.
4117167	4118908	It's just something that goes with conventions.
4120088	4122248	Big deal.
4122448	4125069	It's getting you to go visit their booth.
4125109	4126649	That is the whole point of it.
4127129	4132750	It's one step short of launching fireworks into the show floor.
4133610	4134754	It's pretty much it.
4135295	4141072	Whether it be rappers, people yelling, scantily clad women for photo ops, that's why they're there.
4142699	4144039	All right, let's keep it moving.
4144759	4146440	Going to a completely different topic here.
4146460	4149460	Again, if you guys want to give some feedback, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
4149480	4152461	We'll get into your emails sometime in the next hour.
4152521	4154622	But for now, we're trying to wrap up this hour, so we're going to keep it moving.
4155042	4157842	And, Loki, what's going on with Final Fantasy XI?
4158522	4163143	I know we talked about the ninja and pirate thing, Miklatov, but there's more Final Fantasy XI news coming.
4163183	4168484	Well, Final Fantasy XI is set to debut on the 360 April 18th in North America.
4168624	4171205	Following with a dual release in Japan and Europe,
4171685	4173326	only two days later on April 20th.
4173427	4185275	It will also feature the brand new expansion The Treasures of Ot Ergon and basically the expansion for the PC will also coincide with the launch as well.
4187216	4198685	And one thing to mention that you still require that you have a hard drive and Xbox Live account for this and also the game is still going to suck on the 360.
4198725	4198765	So
4200868	4201428	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4223985	4232789	Ooh, wow, you mean they're not going to give me a better version of Final Fantasy for the 360 that might actually use the hardware for it or might even be in high def?
4233009	4234350	But it's a Moogle Rod!
4234950	4239893	Oh, I'm sorry, that totally makes, you know, up for the crappy game that they're giving me for $60.
4242554	4244175	Let's talk about another MMO, shall we?
4244605	4245205	World of Warcraft GLBT
4262894	4264195	What the hell is the debate going on?
4264255	4273841	Okay, what happened is that there was a player, her name is Sarah Andrews, and she was advertising for a guild, her GLBT-friendly guild, which was Oz.
4274402	4275262	It was the name of the guild.
4275723	4278845	And it was on one of the servers, I don't remember the name of the server off the top of my head, but...
4280666	4287271	This player was issued with a warning from Blizzard under the harassment sexual orientation policy.
4287732	4297579	So in other words, she's out in the town, as often happens in MMOs, people are shouting, you know, complete this quest, I want to do this, who's got this item for me, who can do enchanting?
4298060	4302443	But she's shouting for her guild, and shouting for guild recruitment is not an uncommon thing.
4302463	4303684	You see it in most MMOs, right?
4303704	4304685	Final Fantasy XI, whatever.
4305045	4308228	But her thing was that she was shouting, and it said somewhere at the end, you know,
4308508	4311669	GLBT-friendly or GLBT-OK, something like that.
4311849	4323234	She got a warning from Blizzard saying that that was, you know, that GLBT, that they don't want those type of social issues being promoted in the game chat.
4323294	4331737	Now, they're saying it's not just GLBT, but they're saying, you know, political and religious would also be on the no-no list for this.
4332919	4335041	Where in the licensing agreement did it say so?
4335462	4337204	They keep quoting a part of it.
4337284	4337584	I don't know.
4337604	4340547	But here's the... I don't have the specific on where it's at in the agreement.
4340587	4343250	But Blizzard actually posted a response in their forums.
4343330	4346713	I actually saw this post for myself on one of the chats in the forums there.
4347254	4348215	It came from a Blizzard rep.
4348255	4348495	It said...
4348815	4351456	Apologies for the length of time it took to get this information out to you.
4351736	4359297	We encourage community building among our players with others of similar interests, and we understand that guilds are one of the primary ways to forge these communities.
4359697	4370999	However, topics related to sensitive real-world subjects, such as religious, sexual, or political preference, for example, have had a tendency to result in communication between players that often breaks down into harassment.
4371399	4376680	To promote a positive game environment for everyone and help prevent such harassment from taking place as best we can,
4377020	4377560	Thank you for watching!
4400097	4404181	located at our community website serves as one open avenue for doing so.
4404481	4409585	We will be clarifying some of the language in our game policies in order to help avoid such confusion in the future.
4409985	4411407	So that was the response from Blizzard.
4411847	4413208	But I don't know.
4414009	4415670	For some folks, this isn't good enough.
4415810	4424738	And I can kind of see why because, you know, I don't know how much you guys have played World of Warcraft, these online games, and sometimes there's people around the town going, you know, stop being such a fag.
4425058	4427679	and stuff like that, and it's kind of like, you know... Where's their warning?
4428019	4429039	Exactly, where's their warning?
4429079	4431920	And Blizzard says, well, you have to warn us about that every time.
4432600	4436481	And I thought there was a very excellent response.
4436781	4446183	I was actually looking at the Gamers Experimentations Forum, which is a gamer message forum, and somebody on there had a response to something like, why are you punishing the people on this end of this?
4446403	4448283	I'm not doing a direct quote, I'm doing what I remember here.
4448623	4450684	Why are you punishing the people that are trying to promote this?
4450764	4452004	Why aren't you punishing the people...
4453119	4462762	If you're saying that you're trying to do this because it could constitute harassment, it may turn into harassment later on, why aren't you doing anything about the harassment?
4463183	4466444	Why is it that you do it on this end and not on the end when it turns into harassment?
4467604	4468324	Other thoughts on this?
4468725	4471646	I have more to add, but I want to see your guys' initial thoughts on this.
4472146	4472426	Anybody?
4473726	4475127	Was she a sexy night elf?
4477047	4477748	I really don't know.
4478248	4480168	I really don't know if she was a sexy night elf or not.
4480188	4481349	I'm afraid I can't comment on this.
4483109	4483610	DarkSakura?
4484791	4489736	You know, I actually agree with what you were saying on that.
4489776	4493761	I think it's very touchy.
4494361	4503371	It's not something that they can penalize one party for and not penalize other parties addressing it in different manners.
4507620	4513826	I think that they took something and pushed it a bit too... I don't think she's doing anything wrong.
4515027	4515767	No, definitely not.
4516048	4516528	Definitely not.
4518190	4518970	I know, it's tough.
4519110	4519451	It's tough.
4521132	4522453	Okay, I'm going to say something.
4522473	4527898	I'm going to clarify something on the podcast, which I don't think I've ever said on the podcast before, but I just want to make sure this is understood.
4528439	4529119	I am a gay gamer.
4530191	4534556	So if that's a problem for anybody out there, hello and welcome to 2006.
4534617	4534997	Get over it.
4535357	4540424	Anyway, and obviously it's not been an issue in the past year of podcasts we've done.
4540464	4543267	We've never had an excuse to bring that subject up before, but now we do.
4543527	4545430	I want to give you my perspective on this as a gay gamer.
4546411	4547092	When I first...
4548473	4550294	Read about this story and heard about it.
4550454	4561379	I actually kind of thought I didn't quite understand the big deal because I'm like, okay, I understand Blizzard has this policy where they don't want that kind of stuff being brought up in game and I can kind of see that.
4561799	4568222	It's that, you know, it's a game and they want to keep some of that real world stuff out of it and okay, that's cool.
4568622	4573264	But my problem is, is I think Blizzard is kind of half-assed with their enforcement of it sometimes because
4573584	4574544	Subtitles by the Amara.org community
4591950	4596333	Anyway, and I think if you're in a guild where people can tease each other, it's okay.
4596553	4597794	I've been in those types of guilds before.
4597814	4598915	I had one in Final Fantasy XI.
4599255	4601176	It wasn't a gay guild, so to speak.
4601216	4604218	It was a GLBT-friendly guild because there were lots of gay guys in it.
4604418	4607981	And I don't think that's the way that it sounded like that they were advertising the guild.
4608021	4610362	It didn't sound that offensive anyways.
4610422	4615206	It wasn't like saying, yeah, if you like eating carpet, come on our way.
4615246	4618968	If you like taking up the ass, we're the guild for you or something.
4619846	4626710	It was a disclaimer, to be honest.
4627231	4630533	She did it the right way.
4630593	4635195	She said, hey, I've got this guild, it's a great guild, and put a disclaimer to clarify.
4635556	4636636	That's how I see it.
4639609	4641170	That's kind of my thought on it.
4641190	4642470	It was my initial thought with it.
4642490	4643390	It was kind of like, you know what?
4643470	4646911	I think the big problem here was the way they responded to her.
4647351	4648832	If they had just said, you know what?
4648992	4653493	If they hadn't said, oh, you violated our harassment policy.
4654053	4655293	That was the problem, I think.
4655733	4657174	They should have treated it a little differently.
4657814	4666376	As one who has done chat moderating before, I used to be a chat host for AOL back in the day.
4667108	4670029	You are given set macro responses.
4670590	4672330	You have to respond with a macro.
4672551	4676052	They are all approved by their legal and whoever the hell they are.
4677513	4692820	Clarification can be provided by contacting, at least through AOL, their terms of service people, which I would expect this is the same situation because technically it is chat monitoring, the shouting and everything.
4693684	4698791	It would be responded to with some sort of pre-approved macro and they pick the most appropriate one.
4699712	4703997	Since it specifically relates to that policy, that is the policy quoted.
4704078	4704979	Well, their macros suck.
4706732	4707352	Homogenized?
4707372	4708353	No way, I like the ladies.
4736201	4739442	So in the game, a tauren male might say, homogenized?
4739762	4741162	No way, I like the ladies.
4741682	4744583	Now, that's the type of joke that usually would make me laugh.
4744863	4751604	But now that I think about it in this context where Blizzard says, this kind of thing has no place in our game, I go, hello?
4751864	4752604	They've included it.
4753164	4753504	Hello?
4754125	4755025	Is this a bit of an inconsistency?
4755045	4755585	Here's another one.
4755625	4756085	Listen to this.
4756745	4759306	If you use a tauren male once again with slash flirt.
4759346	4761486	Free rides for the ladies.
4763035	4764336	Free Rides for the Ladies.
4764376	4769962	What if I'm on a roleplay server, and what if I'm in a gay guild that was promoted the appropriate way, and I want my character to be a gay character?
4770663	4772444	Now, usually I would not take issue with this.
4772745	4780532	I understand that, okay, heterosexual is kind of the majority or whatever, and I can take this stuff in jest.
4780552	4783075	You know, I'm not GLAAD, okay?
4783115	4785317	I don't have a problem with these sound clips by themselves.
4785397	4785818	It's fine.
4785838	4786118	They're being
4788059	4789000	Now it's a hypocrisy.
4789340	4790321	That's the problem I have with it.
4790341	4800927	On top of that, for them to even have that in the game, that would have to be approved by their QA, by whatever legal review they have it go through.
4801107	4803028	That had to have been approved by somebody.
4804629	4815156	And then for them to go in and have this rule in place, this type of standard that they're trying to adhere to, yet have it built into the game itself something completely opposite.
4817550	4818991	Anyway, I kind of want to keep things moving.
4819051	4820413	Any other feedback from anyone on this?
4820433	4821594	I'm still going to play it.
4822775	4824537	It doesn't bother me in the least.
4824577	4824837	Really?
4824977	4827640	And you're okay with me saying you're a gay gamer too?
4828080	4831263	Well, you just have no feeling about this?
4831323	4831964	No reaction?
4832104	4838490	I think Blizzard's stupid for saying, oh, we don't want it in our game, and then that clip of the Torrent talking.
4839351	4840432	Whatever, I'm a troll.
4840452	4841273	I don't even hear that.
4843103	4846866	I'm just going to keep shooting things with my arrows and sending my scorpion after.
4846886	4849687	I play a night elephant in Undead, so whatever.
4850208	4859334	I think a lot of the gay folks and my peers, essentially, were quick to shun World of Warcraft pretty quickly.
4859394	4863257	I think Blizzard needs a chance to clarify their policies and whatever.
4864597	4867760	But I do see there's an inconsistency here that needs to be addressed.
4867780	4869601	And if it's not addressed, I'm not going to be happy.
4869981	4873083	Next two patches, I bet you anything, those clips will be changed.
4873324	4873704	We'll see.
4874384	4879448	At least if Blizzard doesn't want to, I'd say, lose some of their clientele, they better change it.
4881289	4881629	We'll see.
4882810	4890156	If they're going to get all angry about somebody shouting for that, can they please get angry about the Chuck Norris things?
4890176	4891356	Because I'm really sick of those.
4891436	4894919	And I think that constitutes as harassment, that I have to put it up with that.
4895339	4895780	I agree, too.
4897225	4897606	All right.
4897646	4898967	Anyway, we got to keep it moving here.
4898987	4901210	We're running really long for the first hour.
4901250	4903052	We're almost in the first hour and a half here.
4903072	4906455	So do you guys maybe want to just go ahead and go to our break now?
4906716	4908498	And then we'll come back for the next part.
4908618	4910800	But remember, Chuck Norris doesn't sleep.
4911080	4911461	He waits.
4912618	4913518	Oh my god.
4914619	4914999	All right.
4915019	4916519	We're going to go ahead and go to a break.
4916539	4919300	When we come back, we're going to talk about Konami Gamers Day.
4919560	4923441	We're going to talk about the possibilities of Microsoft entering the home market, maybe.
4923841	4924241	We'll see.
4924321	4924621	We'll see.
4924901	4925701	That was going around this week.
4926001	4931283	The mailbag, the FUs of the week, the website of the week, and another MMO called Audition.
4932316	4934139	All when we come back from this break.
