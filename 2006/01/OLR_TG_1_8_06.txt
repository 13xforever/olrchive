Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of January 9th, 2006.
You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
Hello everybody once again, and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.
It's that podcast dedicated to what gamers really want to know about.
We here at Orange Lounge like to talk about games that don't suck...
But sometimes, you know, we'll tell you about a couple that do suck just to tell you to stay the hell away.
My name is Rob Roberts.
You might know me as Sky.
My awesome co-hosts are here.
Say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
Hello.
How are you doing?
Okay.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Well, good.
Now, before when we were taping our live show earlier this evening, you were a little sickly, but you're feeling better now.
It was that horrible Chinese food.
I don't think that my body can process that type of stuff anymore.
We went to this horrible Chinese buffet for dinner tonight, and it was cheap, but the food, you know, it's just...
It's the grossest of the gross Chinese food, but, you know, oh well.
It wasn't even that filling.
Anyway, Loki.
Suddenly we're the Food Network.
Loki is over there in that corner, the other co-host.
How you doing?
Hopefully good because that, speaking of the Chinese food place, the beef that was for the Mongolian barbecue type stuff wasn't frozen.
It was quite raw and sitting there out in the open.
That seems like a health code violation to me, but okay.
Okay.
So if I'm dead tomorrow, then we'll know why.
And since it's going to be two hours in length, that means you guys are going to get two podcasts throughout the week.
So Twice the Orange Lounge Radio coming to the podcast stream.
That all starts next week.
Next week's show as well, Freeze Pop.
We're going to have them on the show.
It's going to be awesome.
It's going to be a great interview.
We're really excited to have Freeze Pop, a very well-known band.
If you guys have played Guitar Hero, Amplitude Frequency, it's going to be awesome.
We have one of them coming on, so it's going to be great.
DarkSakura, What's Going On In Your Gaming Week?
To enrich your mind once in a while.
You ever play text adventure games?
Like Zork?
You remember those?
Oh, I used to play Gemstone 3.
Oh, okay.
I never played that one.
Back when I was a geek on AOL.
What about like the middle range?
Like when text games kind of evolved into graphical games and what adventure games are today?
Like King's Quest, Space Quest?
I played King's Quest 4 a little bit, but I just couldn't get into that.
Oh, God.
King's Quest 4 was my favorite.
Actually, I played Loom, but Loom was more sort of a combination.
Yeah, there wasn't so much text at that point, but yeah, that's cool.
So, Loki, how was your gaming week?
It was pretty good.
I've been trying to play a lot more on the 360.
Of course, I've been playing my normal games, Animal Crossing DS every day, and then I've been playing, what else, Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, which I'm very excited to hear that they're
Coming out with a PS2 version of that game.
And a new PSP version of Grand Theft Auto at some point this year.
Then, of course, I got to try a few things on the 360.
First off, I've been playing Call of Duty 2, the single player mode in that.
And that game's amazing.
It's just really awesome.
It does though, I'm playing on the easiest difficulty because I'm not very good at these military first person shooters that involve actual realistic damage to your character and stuff like that.
and so on.
Fight Night Round 3
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Other than that, I did play a little bit of online multiplayer for Call of Duty 2.
It's okay, but do not bring up the guide when you're playing the game online.
I accidentally hit the button trying to hit pause to change my weapon on it.
And my game started glitching out like crazy after that.
So that's something they gotta fix.
And the other thing was the server was full this morning so I couldn't play online.
That kind of sucked.
And I haven't figured out a way to get my friends to play the same game with me.
And that
Also, it's frustrating.
It's a lot of frustrating stuff with Xbox Live.
Well, on the regular Xbox, it's just fine.
I don't know what your problems are, but it's all new.
Yeah.
Well, also, you're kind of a new Xbox user, so maybe there's stuff you're missing.
Exactly.
I don't know what the hell I'm doing.
A lot of times, I've got my... The only other person I have that's actually playing with me is one of my customers, because I do game sales at work, and one of my customers got 360, so I've been talking with him, voice chatting stuff, which doesn't work well, because they use headphones at the same time, too, so...
Thanks for watching!
All right, my gaming week, I didn't play a whole lot of new stuff.
I went out and I got Amplitude for $10 because I had borrowed that game from another friend of mine for like a year.
And finally, I just had to buy my own dang copy, which is great.
And it's a great game.
It's one of the most underrated PS2 games of all time.
That's another reason why I'm excited Freeze Pop's going to be here next week because they contributed to that game.
Also, I picked out a copy of Burnout.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and why did I call it Xbox 1.5?
I have no idea.
Oh, because I have the Halo thing, so sometimes I joke that it's not really the first Xbox.
It's like the 1.5.
Anyway, that's what some people call the 360.
It's a fun game.
I like it.
I like making car wrecks.
I have actually been having trouble with Xbox Live on that game as well, though.
So it's kind of interesting.
Although, I know I'd get my ass kicked if I tried to play a lot online, so I don't really.
I need an actual steering wheel to really get the feel for that game.
The controller is not the same to me.
I can't drive with a controller on that game.
but otherwise it's been the same old stuff not a whole lot of new stuff I've been playing a lot of Animal Crossing and Partners in Time which I talked about a couple weeks ago on the show Mario and Luigi for DS well what's ironic is I'll be quitting Final Fantasy XI at some point here I haven't really set a date yet when I'm going to cancel my account but I'm also going to be participating in the beta for Final Fantasy XI on the 360 that's why I want to get my Xbox 360 I want in on that beta
You know what?
It's going to be pretty in HD.
It's going to be so pretty.
I'll bring it over.
That's not good enough.
I want to play.
I want to start from the beginning.
I'm glad I quit that game.
You can kiss my booty.
That's okay.
I don't know where it's been.
Anyway.
So, well, that kind of leads us into a news item here.
We got the Final Fantasy XI demo is coming to the U.S.
Can't you sign up for it now?
Yeah, they have the sign-ups for it right now to get your content ID numbers, basically, you know, the registration codes that you need.
Are they going to close it?
Should I go and sign up even though I don't have an account?
You probably should.
Okay, I will.
So go sign up right now if you haven't yet.
The demo CD, I'm not sure the other ways to get it.
I do know that it's going to be in the official Xbox Magazine, the February issue.
They're going to have that, but I think there's other ways to get it if you're not subscribed or don't want to buy it.
Have they talked about the limitations of the beta?
Because obviously it can't be the full game.
It's the full game, just not the new patch.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Namco Bondi Holdings USA Inc.
owns Bondi Namco Group US subsidiaries including Bondi America, Bondi Entertainment, Namco America Inc., Namco Cybertape Inc.
being the arcades, and Namco Networks America Inc.
that's the mobile game unit, and Namco Bondi Games America for the video games.
Thanks for watching!
I guess so.
Be interesting.
One day they're all going to be bought by one of the folks, or they'll put out their own consoles.
Who knows?
Who knows?
All right.
Loki, you have some news from the Consumer Electronics Show, right?
What was going on now?
I heard about some new attachment for the 360.
It's going to be pretty big.
Well, there's a lot of stuff going on.
Obviously, they're showing off the new...
Video Technologies, both HD DVD and Blu-ray.
And of course, you know, Sony being behind Blu-ray, then that means, you know, the Microsoft has the back, or the HD DVD.
And so they're actually going to be selling an add-on unit for the Xbox 360 for HD DVD.
It's going to be HD DVD Drive.
The only catch is, it's only for HD DVD movies, not games.
So unless you're thinking, oh, hey, you know,
More storage space for these upcoming games.
I think, again, that's not going to happen.
No, it's that same issue that Xbox 360s didn't come default packed in with the hard drive.
So now not every game can support the hard drive because not everybody has one.
Same thing with the HD DVD.
I still think, though, that they can.
They just make it so that you have to have the hard drive when you buy it.
It's risky.
I mean, Final Fantasy XI is going to have to do it, but it's still risky.
Yeah.
I don't know.
That's one of the things that they've got so far.
I think it's stupid because if I'm going to get an HD DVD player, I'll just get a standalone player.
Why do I need an add-on for the 360?
Which is probably going to be overpriced, like the hard drive.
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
Thanks for watching!
All right, so what about some of the games that were over at Consumer Electronics Show, Logan?
One of the things that they were showing off, actually, in the Dolby Digital booth was Burnout Revenge for the 360, and wow, does it look sexy.
So they actually had a few screenshots.
It was playable, though.
They said that they've added... It's basically built from the ground up.
They've got more detailed models to actually show damage to the cars and stuff, as well as they've added 10 crash junctions...
It's basically going to be just a really nice, pretty-looking version of Burnout Revenge, hopefully with some better single-player mode stuff in there, like Burnout 3.
But, yeah, basically expect it to be really awesome.
It is going to be coming out in March.
Awesome.
One other thing I know they announced at the Consumer Electronics Show, some expansions coming to Xbox Arcade?
Yeah, definitely.
With Xbox Live, the arcade is just awesome to begin with.
And this, of course, being one of the hugest games in the arcade scene, Street Fighter...
is coming to the arcade, and they're doing some pretty cool stuff with it.
Like, for example, they've got this kind of coin-up mode, which is... I heard about this, the quarter mode, it's called.
I heard about this.
This is pretty crazy.
Exactly, and it's kind of basically this new thing created for Xbox Live Arcade.
You can actually do a spectator-based system where you get to watch people play and stuff like that, and you can buy into player matches and stuff.
They've got... Basically, the quarters are used to represent players and pays homage to the arcade type thing.
Voice chat, which is kind of cool because it'll bring back the trash talking from the arcade.
Oh, just what we need on Xbox Live.
More trash talking.
Thank you.
And then they also have...
Gaming Lobby to watch the brawls and stuff like that.
You can do an opti-match, which is good player matching stuff.
Training mode, of course, CPU battles, arcade mode, which is kind of like the arcade type thing.
They have best characters, rankings on which characters are the most popular, monthly rankings, and just a whole new thing.
For a game that's over 10 years old.
Exactly, and 5.1 surround sound, which is
I guess kind of neat.
I don't know what they'd be doing with it, but I don't know.
Personally, I think this is one of the best things coming to the Xbox Live Arcade.
I'm not a huge fighting fan, but it's awesome.
And this is Smash TV was great to begin with.
Oh, exactly.
And I'm hoping that more of this stuff comes to the arcade, and they're talking about maybe one of the rumors was Ninja Turtles arcade games.
So let's get some actual meme stuff on here.
That would be fucking awesome.
I think I would personally be happiest if we got Turtles in Time.
either of the Turtles games or I'm thinking the X-Men game remember that X-Men thing was huge it was like six players I was all over that machine with two screens
Hell yeah, that was an awesome game.
That would be fun to have.
See, you could do that on HDTV.
It would be fun.
Alright.
Here's something else coming out of Consumer Electronics Show, and I love this because I grew up on the Commodore 64.
Well, get this.
Commodore International Corporation now owns this brand, and they're going to be releasing something called the Commodore Combo.
It's going to have five games included and another 90 approximately available for download online.
A 20 gigabyte hard drive running Windows CE.
So, Commodore's coming back in this like handheld thing and I'm assuming that maybe some of the great Commodore 64 classics will be coming to this system.
Probably not great Giana Sisters, but maybe we would have some of the other great Commodore 64 games.
Oh man, the Commodore 64 was such an awesome system.
Like, a lot of games that were on Atari 2600 were on the Commodore 64 as well, but better.
Like, H-E-R-O, I think of off the top of my head.
Just, oh man, I just, I grew up, like, that was my gaming system when I grew up was Commodore 64, so I'm excited about this.
Cool.
I want to see Jumpman Jr.
I want to take that on handheld.
I love Jumpman.
Awesome.
Jumpman, Jumpman Jr., whatever.
How about, I want my Impossible Mission on the go, so I can get that.
Uh...
This would have to do with...
A game called Odama coming out for the GameCube.
Actually, it's a nod to Yu Saito who bought us Seaman.
Who remembers talking to your fish on the Dreamcast?
Marmar.
I never played that game.
I played Seaman.
Oh, actually, more specifically, Dan played Seaman and I would ask him foul questions.
No, I thought Seaman was coming back.
I thought that they were going to remake that or something.
So, Jamie, are you saying you enjoy playing with Seaman?
I'm going to hate you.
Okay.
But basically, you know, Nintendo was really slow to sort of take on to the idea that
But the premise behind it is that it's a military pinball game set in feudal Japan, where you knock down barriers, run over enemies, use a microphone to issue vocal commands.
It seems kind of odd to me.
I would rather have another Seaman, but, you know...
I also think that there's a neat little mention here that Miyamoto's favorite game of all time is Pac-Man.
Yep.
Interesting.
Speaking of the DS, well, that's not really a DS, but speaking of Nintendo and something that's going to be happening with the DS, Contact is a new game currently in development, and it is actually being produced by the same director who produced Capcom's Killer7.
It's about a boy named Cherry who's tasked with helping a nutty professor find all the lost components of his spaceship.
But here's the thing.
It's not just any regular RPG.
They're saying it's going to use the Wi-Fi service.
So...
Ragnarok Online
Ragnarok Online on the DS
DarkSakura, what's going on with Sony's future for the PSP
Well, there's coming up a location-free TV service coming up.
What it will do is it will connect with PC, TV, and PSP, allowing access, streamed audio, visual.
You can watch broadcasts over the Internet.
Using this built-in player, you'd be able to do it from anywhere with a Wi-Fi hotspot.
Also coming out is a new version of the PSP Media Manager so that it will make the transferring, converting all those files a lot simpler.
I know that that will cause some issues with people because it goes to WebMP4 format.
Also they're going to relaunch their iTunes Like Connect to Music download service in March so that you can download game content.
Actually, with the version 2.5 firmware that came out a few months back.
Aren't they on 2.6 now, though?
They are on 2.6.
With 2.5 came the location-free player ability.
Now with the PSP, the only problem is the location-free player hardware part that you need on your PC or your TV.
It's about $300.
Ouch.
Ouch.
Beggar Prince
There has not been a new Sega Genesis game in America since 1998, but now there's going to be a brand new game.
It's called Beggar Prince.
Essentially, it's a little bit of a role-playing game.
It's about a prince who gets out of the castle but is disguised as a beggar.
Now, here's the thing, though.
It was actually released originally in Taiwan in 1996, so they've actually just translated this to...
That's what they cost me though.
Yeah, well, I mean, but that was, you know, the technology is so far ahead.
I could get a PlayStation 2 game or a, you know, Xbox game for 46 bucks, but I don't know.
I suppose it really doesn't matter.
It just depends on how good is the game.
Is the game fun?
So we'll find out.
So apparently it's got great graphics, though, and there's a really interesting innovative combat system.
So if we manage to get a hold of this game, we'll let you know how it is and follow up on it a little bit later.
DarkSakura
We'd have no time to go out and stick our tongue to freezing poles
How to Treat a Tongue Stuck to a Frozen Pole
How appropriate.
Number one, do not pull the tongue off the pole.
Pulling sharply will be very painful.
Uh, duh.
Two, move closer to the pole.
Get as close as possible without letting more of the tongue's surface area touch the pole.
Three, warm the pole with your hands.
A tongue will stick when the surface of the pole is very cold.
A few top layers of the tongue will freeze when it touches the pole, causing bonding.
Place your gloved hands on the area of the pole closest to the tongue.
Hold them there for several minutes.
4.
Take a test pole.
As the pole warms, the frozen area around your tongue should begin to thaw.
Gently pull the tongue away from the pole.
You may leave a layer or two of skin on the pole, which will be painful, but the tongue will quickly heal.
And my last piece of advice?
You'll shoot your eye out?
Stay inside and play more video games.
or if you've got a friend, get some warm water.
No!
Play video games.
And then go out drinking sometime.
So you've basically rendered the past 54 advice columns completely useless with your little... No!
...go inside and play games.
What if somebody is stuck on a runaway camel?
Alright.
But I figured, you know, no one's ever going to follow my advice anyway, as good as it is, so...
Just go play more video games.
You're less in danger of getting stuck to a frozen pole or being on a runaway camel.
Goodbye, DarkSakura's advice column.
We hardly knew ye.
Or we were hardly listening.
Just teasing.
Love ya.
Alright, let's go on over to Loki.
Loki's got some stuff going on in the PSP homebrew world.
What's this, one of the biggest games ever coming to the PSP?
Something like that.
Basically, Quake 2 is being ported to the PSP.
And they're actually doing some pretty interesting stuff with it.
Obviously, you know, the PSP's got limited controls, you know, so how are you going to support everything that was in the PSP?
Well, basically what they're doing with Quake 2 this time is they're not only creating a control scheme that uses the actual buttons and stuff on the PSP, but they're adding the...
Remote for the headset, which is kind of neat.
So you know that little headset player that no one ever uses for the PSP that plugs into the headphone slot as well as that little serial port that's on there?
They're actually using the buttons on that for different things.
So for example, in actual gameplay, they have... Let's see here.
Team Emergency Exit
and they have a whole site here talking about what they're doing with the Quake 2 project and it's being developed slowly if you want to find out more about it check out teamemergencyexit.blogspot.com very cool
Speaking of controllers and innovative things, of course, Nintendo's Revolution Controller always got a lot of buzz.
A little bit of a follow-up here.
Eurogamer actually posted a little bit earlier a story that a lot of places were running, including us, last week about how Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess is going to be supporting the Revolution Controller.
Well, Nintendo has actually quoted in a story on Eurogamer that the article in the January edition of NGC Magazine is speculation.
Nintendo has not made an official announcement regarding this.
The game is still in development.
It will launch on the GameCube in 2006.
So they've essentially said, screw you to that rumor.
Other follow-ups going on is that, you remember we mentioned on a previous podcast that PlayStation 3 is going to be getting Unreal Tournament.
It's supposed to be a launch title.
Well, now it's kind of going back and forth a little bit, and essentially now it's going to be a launch title.
It's not going to be a launch title.
It's going to be a launch title.
It's not going to be a launch title.
Now they've said, Epic has come out and said, it will be done when it's done.
And if it just so happens that it's done when the PlayStation 3 is out, great.
But we're not pushing to be a launch title or whatever.
It's done when it's done.
That's so much agony and ecstasy.
You've seen that movie, yes?
No.
It's the one about Michelangelo painting the Sistine Chapel.
When will it be finished?
When it's finished?
And Cultured!
That I don't get.
How the F were they there and we weren't?
I don't know.
But anyways, it did shed some light on how they're going to be using the Revolution controller probably for older games.
But anyways, for example, The Legend of Zelda.
One controller will be used to slash your sword and the other controller can actually be used as a shield.
There's also a fishing minigame, which I'm assuming is in...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Super Smash Bros.
Every time you hold...
You punch while holding the controller on screen.
Your character will do the same.
The Revolution Remote controller also has a rumble feature so it will vibrate whenever you hit.
Interesting.
Interesting.
I wonder what they're going to do with some of the old school games with this.
Someone else brought up something very interesting.
Since it does use the old GameCube controllers and it has the port on there, maybe you can use your old GameCube controllers for some of these games as well.
Instead of actually having to use the Revolution controller.
Maybe.
Interesting.
All right, well, let's see what people are commenting on stuff that we do.
And the way we do that is we open up our old mailbag.
It's 2go at orangelaunchradio.com is the place to go if you want to get it.
It's the place to go.
If you want to send us an email, 2go at orangelaunchradio.com.
But actually, that email address may be changing because we're actually dropping the 2go name from our show starting next week.
We're just going to be Orange Launch Radio.
That email address will still be good.
Don't worry.
No messages will be lost.
It will simply forward to whatever the new address ends up being.
We'll let you know what that is next week.
So you can still continue to send your messages for now at togo.org.
And that's where DarkSakura is going to open up the mailbag and peer in there and see what's in there.
So what do we got this week?
Oh god, I've got so much freaking email.
Well, pick a couple good ones and see what's up.
Our buddy Lord Kausu on the board, also Takuland.
Sure.
has basically pretty much corrected me on the game I was trying to think of for PC Engine, one of those betas.
It was Space Fantasy Zone, which is the one that I do not have, because it's only a beta.
I don't even remember.
It's been a week.
Our listeners are great at memory, but I can't even remember this discussion.
That's all right, all right.
But that was the other Fantasy Zone game I was trying to think of on TurboGrafx that I don't have.
because it was only beta.
But there's downloads available.
I was playing Fantasy Zone 2 on GameTap this week because I never realized that there was a Fantasy Zone 2.
I have it on Master System.
Yeah, that's what it was on.
And Fantasy Zone The Maze.
I just want to point out it's the same damn thing as Fantasy Zone 1.
Yeah.
Okay, just wanted to make that clear.
Yep, it sure is.
Also, we got... I do apologize because I'm trying to go through the list.
Um, someone, Crispy Creamy, emailed us, uh, saying, I heard a rumor about the PS3, is it that the PS3 will have something in each system, so when you put a new disc into your system, it marks the disc, making that disc only play on your own system.
Is this just a rumor?
It has to be just a rumor.
It's a rumor.
That would so lower on their marketability.
Seriously.
And it would piss Gamefly off.
essentially that would kill a company like that to do that to games I think borrowing games from friends and all that stuff I think that adds to I realize I want to combat piracy but that's I don't think that's the way to do it that's not the way to combat piracy because you know then you can't let your friends borrow games that's how I found out a lot about a lot of great games especially back in the 8-bit NES day and still to some extent today so that that would not be a smart idea Sony if you're listening
Psychonauts for PsyOps, The Mindgate Conspiracy Grim Fandango, Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Monkey Island
This person has the single best name ever, by the way, My Little Pony Killer.
Chippa Thingy
I have some stuff to say, though.
First off, on the latest podcast, you read a list of games that need a sequel.
I think StarCraft should have a sequel.
That game was awesome.
It was the game that got me into PC gaming, but Brood Wars has an expansion, even though it had enough game in it to have been released as StarCraft II.
Next, I think Ninja Gaiden should have a true sequel.
Ninja Gaiden Black was not a true sequel, and I want more.
and mentioning about bringing Ninja Gaiden 2 on Xbox Live Marketplace.
But that's... What was that?
Tecmo did it.
Yeah, Tecmo.
I don't know if I was thinking Sega for a moment.
Because Sega did Shinobi.
That's why I was getting confused.
But Tecmo...
I don't see why they wouldn't do it.
They're buddy-buddy with Microsoft now.
Do you remember on the Super Nintendo they had the Ninja Gaiden trilogy on Super Nintendo?
It was like all three games on one cartridge.
It was kind of interesting because it was one of the first collections I remember that early on.
But they didn't change the games at all.
It was just three games, one cart.
It was kind of neat.
Yeah, I'd like to see a more...
I mean, I like Ninja Gaiden, the new version and all, but I'd like to see something a little truer to the roots, sure.
But do you remember the old, old, old Ninja Gaiden arcade game?
It really didn't play like the Nintendo ones, to me anyway.
It didn't play like the Nintendo ones to me at all.
But there was also an interesting question on here.
What's with this next generation pricing anyway?
You pay $10 more for the new Madden when it just has slightly prettier graphics.
What?
Their excuse is higher development costs to get these higher rents.
It's just a big excuse.
I know, it's a big bunch of blah.
Give it time.
When the other two systems come out, there'll be competition.
Nintendo will try to undercut them all.
Well, that's the whole thing right now.
It's like, okay, 360 games.
They're all coming out at $60 pretty much, except for three of them.
What are you going to do?
Buy a different game?
Sorry, there's only two games coming out that month.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I don't like government and gaming.
It just doesn't work.
Alright.
Any other emails, DarkSakura?
Well, yeah, I got kind of a few.
And I got a few from our buddy Rob, who I always love hearing from.
But I'm just going to go over them in a little bit of detail.
There was one about the PSP to TV converter on iGearLive.com.
Another one he sent me was a pretty long article.
I'm not going to go into too much detail, but I would love for our listeners to read this because it's a very good article.
Um, yeah, I said he found it on a slash dot.
Um, but there, it's talking about how EB and GameStop relies on used games to stay afloat.
And honestly, I can, that's all I hear about is getting those used game sales in and using that discount card and all that.
Um, but the article is at escapistmagazine.com slash issue slash 26 slash 3.
Um,
To sum it up, and I read through quite a bit of this article, it's that once more places start doing more online content, as far as the old games go, there may not be as much of a let's purchase the used games.
And so that's really going to take a lot of the steam, a lot of the livelihood out of what keeps these companies alive.
Interesting.
It makes sense because consider how GameStop started.
It used to be Funkoland, which I remember.
Used games!
Yeah, the 8-bit days, they would advertise in magazines.
It was a mail-order company for used games.
I don't know.
I think that actually, if anything, you would want more people to buy used games.
Like, for example, Halo.
Halo 2 right now, you can buy a used.
It's pretty cheap.
It's still one of the most widely played games out there, and you can download different content, maps, and stuff for it.
So it sounds good to me.
For the record, I would like to point out that GameStop and Funkoland were two different places.
GameStop is a fully owned subsidy of Barnes & Noble.
But didn't one buy the other at some point?
Yes.
GameStop purchased Funkoland, Babbage's, Sawfare, etc.
But they're all fully owned subsidy of Barnes & Noble, which is why I get books cheap.
All right, anything else?
Was that it for now?
For now.
All right.
Keep them coming.

Let's go back over to Loki, who has a story about the Eye River.
Yes, Eye River.
It's the thorn in all of those wonderful portable MP3 player's sides.
This time they're actually trying to get into the game market, which is quite interesting.
With the brand new iRiver G10.
It actually looks kind of like a, to be honest, it looks like one of those things that Ben Heck would have made.
You know, the guy that did all those retro consoles and the portable systems.
But anyways, it has a nice 800x480, 260,000 color display, as well as it's running off of Windows CE 5.0, kind of like the Commodore Portable.
It's also going to contain a 4 or 6 gigabyte storage on the actual system right now.
They're kind of just showing it off as being able to play videos and stuff like that and some Korean games.
Not really too much on it right now.
Some people are saying, oh, this could be the PSP killer.
I say no.
You know, it's interesting, though.
I mean, do you know who everybody says should be getting into gaming?
Well, not everybody, but, you know, I keep seeing this on message forums, who they say should be getting into gaming.
And, you know, a lot of people think that it's one of these things where they're just going to come out of nowhere when no one realizes it, and they're either going to fully back somebody else, or they're just going to come out with their own thing that's just going to blow your effing mind.
You know who?
Apple.
Apple.
And, you know, I just...
Look at them.
Don't they look like they're up to something?
Don't they just have that look on their face, Apple?
Yeah, and they'll make a game system that looks pretty and people will buy it despite the fact that the specs suck.
Well, who knows?
I don't know.
I get this feeling Apple's got to be up to it.
If Apple wanted to enter the handheld market, they could.
If Apple wanted to team up with Nintendo, oh my god.
I've said this on an earlier podcast.
Apple, Nintendo, these two companies excel at getting you to buy the same damn thing with cool new features over and over again.
Look at the iPod.
iPod Mini, iPod Nano, iPod Video.
And look at the Game Boy Pro.
Game Boy Advance, Game Boy SB.
If these two companies got together, it would be dangerous to your wallet.
But just food for thought.
All right.
Xbox 360 is pissing off Gamefly a little bit because they are getting a lot of scratched Xbox 360s back.
And they're actually having this form letter now that's going out that says, essentially...
you've been identified as somebody who sent back a scratched game to us if in the future should Gamefly receive Xbox 360 games from you that have been damaged you'll be charged a replacement fee so they're getting a little ticked off that a lot of their games are coming back scratched should be noted that we haven't really seen this for the others obviously all the systems are CD based so it seems interesting that this one's making headlines about the Xbox 360 because they're the only ones that have like a really shoddy put together CD-ROM drive that doesn't have the buffers in them to keep this level and so when you tilt it
or bump it, it scratches.
So don't move the Xbox 360 while you're playing your game.
Yeah.
Oh, side note though, and what I thought was quite interesting is the Xbox 360 knows whether it's on its side or on its standing up.
It's got a level in there because there's a little light on the little ring of light that shows which controller is player one.
If it's on the ground, it will be still up in the upper left corner.
You tilt it up, it will move itself so that it's in the upper left corner.
I just want to mention real quick, Blood Rain came out in theaters this week, you know, Uwe Boll's latest epic.
I think it grossed about a million dollars, well out of the top ten this week.
Are any of us surprised?
He has the next three films financed already, so we will be at least seeing three more films.
You know there's one of those stupid little internet petitions going on?
That's old.
I've seen that before.
But it made me laugh.
It really made me laugh.
It's getting a resurgence now because of this movie.
By the way, I should point out, internetmoviedatabase.com, it's already showing up in their bottom 100 movies of all time.
44 last time I checked.
All right.
Let's go and get another story.
Let's go over to DarkSakura, who has another story about the 360, something about the UK for our UK folks.
Actually, yes, I do.
There's basically a European Xbox Live marketplace has been keeping playable demos and supplies.
However, they have found a way to get American and Japanese games, some of the demos.
Apparently the way to do that, according to GamerReport.com, is all you have to do is go to Microsoft's password site and create a new Hotmail account and then say you're either from Japan or the United States.
That's kind of smart.
Make a note of the phone number that you supply.
And once you've activated it, turn on your Xbox 360, press the guide button, and select Switch Profile.
Huh, good way to get around that.
Smart thinking, guys.
My source hasn't tried it out yet, but I would love to listen to any of our UK listeners that have an Xbox 360.
Give it a try.
Let me know what you find.
Now, it does... I have seen... This is actually also on Xbox360.qj.net, previously known as Xbox 360 Updates.
They have tried it, and it does work.
So, what you can gain, though, from...
RidgeRacer6
Virtual Reality in the Revolution, Loki?
Yeah, and the continuing saga of... The continued speculation about 3D on the Revolution.
Exactly.
At CES this year, they were showing off a 3D visor called the Z800 3D visor.
It was actually put out...
by a third-party company.
So everybody is kind of taking a look at it, but still kind of backs up the whole thing, you know, virtual reality type stuff.
Probably checking out to see what their competition's doing, you know.
I'm still saying, E3 this year, come find out, you're going to see something different.
And there's another thing that they've actually registered, the Nintendo, was it like Floor Vision?
I heard about that, yeah.
I just love the first line of this.
It's official.
The IRS has its eyes on your virtual gold.
Oh, I did hear about that.
Okay, what's up with this?
Well, it's basically saying that they're just kind of keeping an eye on this as a potential.
But the latest issue of Legal Affairs Magazine, IRS Advisors Specializing in Barter Income, recently offered the opinion that any trade of one virtual item for another, gold pieces for thick leather, Uber drops for platinum, could constitute taxable income gathering exchange according to the IRS's rules on barter.
But how can you enforce that with a worldwide game?
Yeah, I know.
But... They're not real items.
I know.
What's the government going to do with 10 gold pieces in WoW?
I mean, seriously.
But basically saying so long as each good has a determinable fair market value.
Yeah.
You're not going to be paying them in gold pieces.
You're going to pay them in real money.
Yet, you're not actually exchanging real money in the game.
How would they enforce that out of a European player?
Well, that's basically the problem.
They have to... Right now they're working on consistency for it.
A lot of people have objected to this.
I mean, just really objected.
Well, duh.
It has to do with money.
My thing is, though, is I'm going to take significant losses in these games because if they can take it, I can take it.
That's right.
I could write it off, my taxes, right?
If I start a business and wow and lose money.
Imagine just what a pain in the ass it would be for there to be issued 1099s on every single player.
We're talking people who aren't even old enough to be taxed.
You can't own real land, but hey, we can tax you for getting that, you know, helmet.
Something tells me this ain't gonna fly.
It's not gonna.
Weird idea.
And if it does, I'm freaking moving.
Why are people in the IRS actually, why are they actually looking at this?
I mean, don't they have better things to do?
Because our government is PO.
All right.
They want money.
Fantasy Star Universe is a game some of us here have our eye on.
It was supposed to be coming out for PS2 and PC in Japan on February 16th, but it's been pushed back.
March 30th now is the new date that Fantasy Star Universe will be coming out.
Quality improvement is the reason.
It's unknown yet what it'll do to the US and European release dates because they weren't unscheduled.
So, spring, summer, who knows, but Fantasy Star Universe is at least making its debut sometime in 2006.
Should be interesting.
Loki's got one more story for us tonight regarding Mario Mix.
Mario Mix, it's official from Nintendo.
They won't sell anymore.
It's done.
Now, whether it's coming back at some point, who knows, but you're not going to be able to find it because stores can't do reorders on it.
They're not making any more as far as it's concerned right now.
So if you own it, lucky you.
It's a collector's item.
Yeah, it's gone.
I should have bought it when I had the chance.
Final Fantasy XII PlayStation 2 coming out March 16th in Japan.
and it's going to be going out for an open price.
What the heck does this mean?
This means that there is no set manufacturer suggested retail.
The stores can just sell it at whatever price they want to set.
Of course, Sony and Square Enix sets a price to the retailers, so I don't know, this whole thing doesn't really make sense to me, but the retailers can choose their own profit levels, which I think is very interesting.
I'm going to take a wild guess here, and since there is no profit in systems, as we had a conversation earlier this week about how systems are sold for about $5 more than what the retailer pays for them, so my guess is going to be maybe around what they're paying for them.
And get this, you also get with this a PlayStation 2 stand and a Final Fantasy XII phone strap.
One more story for us tonight, and DarkSakura is bringing it to us.
It has to do with a new game coming out featuring some classic characters.
I remember talking about these guys before, so what's happening?
It's just a little tiny something.
Namco, I love Namco, has basically confirmed for us Snoopy vs. the Red Baron.
and it's where Snoopy has a magical dream and becomes a World War 1 flying ace who must pilot a biplane to stop the Red Baron Crimson Skies featuring Snoopy is great I just think that's going to be cool I'm hoping that they have the unlockable Snoopy's doghouse as the plane
I'm hoping they have the unlockable minigame where Charlie Brown tries to kick that football from that fucking bitch that never lets him do it.
Lucy.
Yeah, Lucy.
You can finally kick the damn ball.
And steer past the kite eating tree.
Linus searches for his blanket.
Final thoughts time.
My final thought is good grief.
Loki, your final thought.
My final thought is I've got to play some more 360 stuff.
DarkSakura, your final thought.
Reject false icons.
And that's going to put the nail in the coffin of this episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
