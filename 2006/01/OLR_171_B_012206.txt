To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
And now the conclusion of episode 171 for January 22, 2006.
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 171, the second half here for this January 22nd, 2006.
Pretty lively first half there.
I just made the official donation there during the break.
I went on to the LiveJournal community thing and donated for the Flowers for Jack thing, and I left a little message, $20 from us, so that'll be lovely.
We'll see what happens with that.
I just hope I didn't fund somebody's vacation in Tahiti, so that's why I didn't send more.
No one goes to Tahiti.
I know.
Anyway...
All right.
Anyway, let's get right back into the news.
Yes, we will be opening up the Skype line a little later on for those of you guys in our chat room.
By the way, I think we set a new record in chat tonight for the number of people that we have watching in our chat room tonight.
So thank you guys so much for making this combined show a success and making our live show really take off.
We appreciate it.
And, of course, those of you that listen on the podcast, too.
We know not everybody can watch Sunday night because, you know, some of you guys are watching.
What are the big TV shows on Sunday night?
Family Guy?
Some of you guys are watching Family Guy and the other stuff.
Don't get my ideas, Emily.
I shouldn't give him ideas.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Don't watch Family Guy.
It sucks now.
It's not as good as the first couple seasons.
The TV is as brilliant as me and not watch TV.
You know, this is somewhat gaming related.
I'm going to kind of go off on a random tangent.
I don't care.
I was watching 24.
I only watched the first half because, you know, they did like this four-hour premiere thing last week.
I only watched the first half of it because that's a lot of TV.
I mean, hooray for DVR.
But I was thinking while I was watching it, the show is so suspenseful and very, I don't know, like Metal Gear-esque.
I'm thinking, gosh, this show would make a great video game.
And then I was like, oh yeah, there is a video game.
I remember seeing the trailer at E3, but it's been in development for so long that I believe the story was supposed to be between seasons two and three.
That's correct.
But I don't want to spoil anything, but this show has a tendency to kill off characters that you really get attached to.
So I think it's very interesting that the game is possibly going to have characters that have now been killed off in the storyline.
It's
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
but not as good as games that were out on the Commodore 64.
And I'll tell you what, a lot of people say that they grew up on Atari 2600 or they grew up on Nintendo, ColecoVision, Odyssey, whatever it was, arcades.
I grew up on the Commodore 64.
So, Loki, what did you find out in Commodore 64 news, believe it or not?
C64S.com C64S.com
Ghosts and Goblins, Paperboy, Bruce Lee, Boulder Dash 2, and Blue Max as the top 10 right now.
Oh my gosh, I had Blue Max.
That's crazy.
Boulder Dash, I had that game too, and of course Archon.
Oh my gosh.
What about The Last Ninja?
That game was awesome.
Spy vs. Spy.
I love Spy vs. Spy.
Tons of Boulder Dash stuff on here.
Bomb Jack, Commando 2.
It was a huge title.
Back to the Future, Outrun, Pitfall, you know a lot of games that were on Atari were on Commodore 64 but with better graphics and that's one of them.
And also the one that comes to mind is H.E.R.O.
which is a game I play a hell of a lot of on GameTap.
The graphics on Commodore 64 were way better than the ones on Atari which kind of makes me sad because they don't have the Commodore version on GameTap.
They have about 100 games on there.
Awesome.
Now you know I gotta ask, is this legal?
I don't know.
Check that out, relive your youth
of course I checked out Commodore 64 emulators and they were first the big things in the emulator scene and a lot of them were just really clunky and hard to use so I like this idea of having it much easier and kind of streamlined into the website very nice alright let's move on to a very very new game and a very very popular game in this day and age World of Warcraft I talked about it earlier in the show there's some stuff coming up for what's going on with World of Warcraft Jamie you first
Well, actually, they are going to be celebrating the Lunar New Year.
in World of Warcraft.
There's a celebration, they're saying, as in S-A-L-E.
They'll be getting Sparkly and Azeroth on account of the Lunar New Year, is what it says, between January 27th and February 14th.
There'll be celebrations focusing on Moonglade.
The 29th will also see celebrations in Stormwind, Thunderbluff, and Booty Bay.
Booty Bay.
and while every capital will be decorated on February 13th there will be a firework show at Moonglade paralleling the Chinese Festival of Lanterns so there will be a humongous light show.
Gameplay based events going on based on Azeroth's ancestors quest for holiday items as rewards tokens that can be redeemed for rockets and fireworks and festival dumplings and
different outfits available for the Lunar Holiday.
Does Blizzard know how to throw a party or what?
Seriously?
They do some fun events.
I saw an interesting response to this though on some message board is that they were saying that this was a kind of a way for World of Warcraft to kind of appeal to the Chinese players right now because I guess they did something I haven't really been following a lot of WoW drama but I guess maybe they did something to kind of turn the Chinese players off when they launched the games there so they're saying that this is kind of a way to show that oh we can do you know oh maybe it was because of like the the more you know um
Thank you for watching.
See you next time.
Since the launch, that was less than a year ago.
Bringing the total number of subscribers to the game worldwide to about 5.5 million.
This also just in World of Warcraft will soon be renaming itself to just The World.
That was a .hack joke for those of you guys that didn't get that.
Oh, I get it.
I made a joke.
This is why I do a podcast out of the spare bedroom of an apartment and I don't do comedy.
Uh, Loki, speaking of other things I can't do, one of them is playing Xbox 360, because I still have yet to find one of these little bastards, but that doesn't stop the Xbox 360 news from coming in, and holy crap, do you have a lot of it tonight, starting off with Japan?
Are they buying them yet?
Nope, not buying them in Japan.
In fact, only about 7,477 systems have sold there.
Um...
and I think I mentioned last week that they're being beaten out by every other console system out there, which is pretty bad.
And as far as the U.S.
sales go... Including Gizmondo, believe it or not.
I'm kidding.
Including the U.S.
sales, you know, they've only sold only about 600,000, which is pretty pitiful.
Let's see.
Now, the other thing that we have here is they were kind of going back and forth on whether they wanted a third party... Or not third party.
External...
Blu-ray or external HD DVD drive.
Now, of course, they're backing HD DVD 100%, whether it becomes the format of choice or not.
Wasn't there a little bit of backtracking this week?
It was like, well, we might still do a Blu-ray.
It's kind of like, we'll wait and see.
Are they committing or what?
They're committing.
All right.
So, you know, we'll see.
That's kind of what I'm thinking, but...
Okay, anyways, the other thing is they released a list of the top 10 online Xbox Live Arcade games that are out right now and the most downloads that they've had.
To no surprise, number one, Geometry Wars.
Which is the main reason why a lot of people are actually getting an Xbox 360.
Screw Call of Duty.
Screw it.
Right in the ear.
All these fun, okay.
Now, Gauntlet, number two, the retro Gauntlet.
That surprised me, because I thought Smash TV would have been number two.
Smash TV's number three.
Well, there you go.
Bejeweled 2, number four.
Zuma, number five.
Bank Shop Billiards, which is number six.
Correct me if I'm wrong, Zuma and Bejeweled, two games you can play online for free, right?
Yeah.
Already, okay, just checking.
Do those games offer achievements, though?
Outposts Kaloki Mutant Storm Reloaded Joust
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
All right.
That's pretty much it for now.
All right.
Sounds good.
What else is going on?
Of course, they're getting more units in each week.
It's just, they're surprised, you know, it's taking so long and they're thinking that the, you know, pre-orders will still be there until, like, February.
I'm wondering how many of them are getting cancelled because people are finding them through other means.
There's a lot of people cancelling them, but even still, that's not really affecting anything.
The other thing is there's going to be a major update to Xbox Live, or through Xbox Live.
The main feature that's going to be added to it is a webcam feature, which, you know,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Oh, I don't know, Loki.
Halo?
Halo and Halo 2
If you're expecting more games to be added, like Microsoft said, they're going to be adding more and more each week.
I think, again, they're taking a vacation.
You're not going to see any more updates to the backwards compatibility until about March or April.
Hopefully they're taking a vacation down into the factory to build some more Xbox 360s.
It's sad.
They've only had two updates to the whole backwards compatibility thing since launch.
Wasn't it going to be a weekly thing?
Microsoft, learning to disappoint.
Learning?
You mean they didn't already know?
Well, they're perfecting disappointment.
I see.
Some comments from the chatroom.
Wonderdog Harold says, Don't forget that Barbie game is backwards compatible.
Oh, I'm sorry.
All the kids want to play that.
Rini has a response to the webcam thing.
Hooray for webcams.
Let's see people's asses and peni.
Which I think is the plural term for, you know, wang.
Yeah.
www.orangeonestradio.com click on chat by the way to join our chat if you're listening live on Sunday night but our chat room you know our chat room is swinging during the week too as well for those of you guys listening on the podcast because we do other live shows here on Orange Ones Radio Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday night and they're not podcasts we just don't have the bandwidth people so you have to listen live if you want to hear it and we play a whole lot of copyrighted music because we can it's all legal through Live 365 our friends and buddies over there at Live 365 who have been hosting us for so long and taking our money
And now for something completely different.
Another way you can interact with our show is not just through chat, not just through Skype, but there's the old email.
And you send us an email to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and Jamie, she looks in there in the cavernous mailbag and pulls out a few of her favorite emails.
What'd you find for us this week?
Well, we get so many, I have to really be... I try to reply to as many as possible.
Now, it used to be I could reply to everybody.
We's loved Thank you, you guys are awesome, thank you Anyway, we actually, and I wanted to go ahead and give them a shout out Gorilla at 3guys3beers.com They do a podcast Actually wrote in, supporting the Mac Oh, not this again Yes, this again Oh boy I'm going to just read a little bit of this, if I may
Is that all I wanted to say?
Loki, suit up.
Abestos.
I know they're gunning for you here.
All the Mac fans are.
Whatever.
It's just my opinion.
I didn't... Let her speak.
Whatever.
I just like this quote here.
It says, Well, if I drive a dump truck at work, does that mean I have to drive one for my own personal car?
In reference to the PC.
Okay.
You know, it says, Windows has...
I'm going to read this one here.
So if someone is all about games, yeah, Windows has many more.
If someone is about music, podcasting, graphics, internet, pictures, making personal DVDs, movies, Mac is the way to go.
And honestly, I have to agree, I can't wait until I get my Intel iMac.
He also says he can do a Mac with OSX, what he does on his PC, and you can actually customize how your Mac works, so I fully agree with that.
And also, just to read the last full paragraph in here, it's like, well, I've said enough once again.
Great show.
Keep it up.
I like that.
Just don't talk trash about Macs, Loki.
Talk about jumping to the past.
Windows looks just as shitty as it did back in the early 90s.
Can't polish a turd.
Rebuttal?
How many PCs out there are running Windows?
How many are running Mac OS X?
Yeah, I think so.
And all those features that a Mac can do.
Yeah, a PC can do just as well, if not better.
Whatever.
It's my opinion.
I don't care.
You can go ahead and bitch and moan about it.
I will never buy Mac products ever, and this includes iPods.
I'm wondering how actual numbers is opinion.
Actual numbers are facts.
I think I went into the mailbag earlier this week and I was looking at random emails.
I don't know if you're going to read this one.
If you are, I'm sorry.
But there was one email that pretty much simply said something like, you know, I'm a Mac user.
Skye, you're cool.
You moderate.
Jamie, you rock.
Loki, fuck you.
Yeah.
I think I forwarded that one.
I really don't care.
Everyone keeps bringing this up to me because they want me to argue about it.
And I really don't care if you use a Mac.
I'm never going to use it because I don't buy computers based on flavors.
So...
Subject change, subject change
You know, it's funny.
I don't have the same thing I had before.
I have a sinus infection now, which I'm taking antibiotics for.
Somebody wrote to my personal email suggesting you take a vitamin.
Me take a vitamin!
I mentioned that you used to work for GNC, so you're pretty well up on the vitamins.
I thank them for their concern.
You attract the fanboys and the bugs.
Yeah.
Womp womp.
Anyway, also we got an email from Press Start about the comment about Tetris.
In fact, the email was labeled Tetris is great.
It says, yes, every new console released for all eternity should have some version of Tetris.
Actually, rephrase, every new console released for all eternity should have the Game Boy version of Tetris.
And also Scorched Earth because that game is one of the best multiplayer games ever.
Anyway.
Amen.
So it's still around somewhere.
I have Tetranet somewhere on my computer.
You only need the program.
I wanted to read this paragraph in the letter.
Sure.
Also, now that you have all this time and you don't have to do your show as if you're playing Daytona USA News Topic Checkpoint, time extended, I have a suggestion.
Thank you for watching!
Jamie Sort Through That
who says, you asked about when we're changing the email addresses.
Actually, it's already changed.
Just the two go still works.
I'm checking all of them.
That's why I said I have a whole bunch of email to go through.
Also, about Dance Dance Revolution Supernova, is it only going to be in the arcades?
Is there any chance of being able to play the new game at home?
There are no arcades in there, so it will be pretty hard to play this game.
Also, he loves the new format.
Having twice as much to listen to each week is awesome.
Aw, thank you.
But I'm sure that it's a matter of time until we see it.
But, you know, it'll be eventually, I'm sure, if it's very popular.
Also, one last one.
BlazeGamerDude1212 wrote in, said, started listening to the show about two months ago.
Has to say that he thinks the three of us are amazingly good at what we do.
Aw, hugs.
And please continue to do what you are doing.
However, I want to correct Loki.
He said that the site for the new Xbox Live Diamond is www.xboxlivediamondcard.com and it isn't.
After hearing the xboxlivediamond.com site was fake, it went to xbox.com and looked through the site to get the Diamond Card site and it actually is xboxlivediamond.com.
Is that still going on?
Yeah, they're still advertising even on the dashboard for 360.
It's like...
I haven't gotten my card, I signed up the first day they had it.
Yeah, they'll make those when they make more 360s.
A little addition, he also says that for fans of Triple Triad, he found the game online as Google's Triple Triad Gold.
Alright, very cool.
Did you have the email from the other podcaster that sent us the email?
If not, I can pull it up because I read it too.
I'm sure I did.
I'll go ahead and let you cover that.
Okay.
I actually received an email from another podcaster, sent us a message, and it was from... Let's see.
I've got to find it in here somewhere.
It came from Godfrey, who's over at Gamertag Radio, his name in that show, and they wanted to tell us about this segment that was going on that they covered in their latest episode because...
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
I try to stay away from listening to them a lot.
Plus, I just don't have time.
But I do try to catch the occasional one.
So I was listening to this Gamertag Radio, and I listened to their segment, and I thought it was pretty interesting, and I would recommend it.
My only thing is that I saw it a little more as a social commentary than necessarily something about games.
They do incorporate games into it because...
The folks that do this show are other ethnic minorities, and they were kind of talking about that they don't like seeing games like 50 Cent Bulletproof being representations of the community and kind of being pushed there.
But they kind of talked a whole lot about other stuff too.
I thought it was a very good piece.
It was a very smart thing, so I'd recommend it certainly.
And there's a lot of minority stuff.
groups in America, and I'm sure feel a little bit underrepresented or stereotyped by video games sometimes.
So I thought this was a great piece.
You know what I also thought was really good about this show, this particular show?
The girl they have on that show is really good.
And she didn't say a whole lot during this segment, but I was kind of surprised because I expected Gamertag Radio to be mostly about Xbox, because, you know, Gamertag, but she was the one that brought up Nintendo, and she said, you know what, that's why I like Nintendo, because Nintendo...
They're just fun.
They just put out fun games.
I tend to agree that the games I like the best, I think about the two greatest games I played last year, Luminous and Meteos, were puzzle games that have nothing to do with race, color, religion, sexuality, stereotypes, nothing.
It's just fun games.
You've missed the norm for anything out on GameCube.
I like her a lot.
You and her need to get together and do a girly show.
It would be good.
It would be good.
It would be good.
Go check that out.
It's good stuff.
Gamertagradio.com, I think.
Check it out.
Search for them on iTunes.
Alright, let's move on here.
We're going to go to another topic.
And Loki, well, speaking of some of these games that are an insult to some people, 25 to Life.
Who hasn't 25 to Life insulted?
Well, let's see.
Well, no, no.
25 to Life, the National Law Enforcement...
and Officers Memorial Fund is calling for a boycott of 25 to Life.
And not because the game sucked and got horrible reviews.
But apparently it's because the game promotes killing of cops and all that stuff.
Yada, yada, yada.
Basically, they don't like it because the game really has no plot to it and just promotes killing of cops and killing of gangsters and kill, kill, kill.
Basic yada, yada, yada.
Anyway, so that's all you need to know.
It's the same reason why, you know,
Jack Thompson gets his paintings in the bunch over Grand Theft Auto and all those other games out there.
Is there an actual boycott going to happen?
Not likely.
In fact, this will probably push sales up.
So, way to go.
I know very little about this game.
What else do you know about this game?
25th of Life basically revolves around three characters in the game.
For some reason, there's really hardly any missions to it as far as
Kill 25 Cops, Kill This, Kill That.
You get to play as either cops or gangbangers throughout the game.
They have multiplayer on it as well.
It was supposedly one of the better games coming out in January.
All of two that were good that were coming out.
Of course, it ended up getting horrible reviews.
I believe, if I remember correctly, IGN gave it a 3.9.
I think the highest I've seen for it is a 5 out of 10.
Really bad.
because it's really buggy and stuff and the graphics suck and

DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Ask any non-gamer and they'll tell you.
We're all a bunch of slackers who never grew up.
This is an excellent tie-in to other controversial stories this week, right?
A bunch of overgrown kids who spend their money on games when there are real ways we could be spending our money, like on minivans with doors that open by themselves.
So anyway, the story goes on.
It says, any community tends to define itself in some way, so perhaps it's time the gaming community does the same.
Gamers are a diverse group, but most fall into one of six categories.
I'm going to ask you guys which category you think you fit into.
Here we go.
Here's the six categories.
Hardcore gamers.
Hardcore gamers, the average one they say is not married, but they say that's rare.
It's just a very small group.
They're just essentially hardcore gamers.
They know their games and gaming the way that doctors know the bones of the body.
Hardcore gamers know it all, and they're proud of their gaming knowledge.
Let's see, we have Devoted Gamers.
They have the singular obsession, the one game, whatever it may be, like Halo 2.
And sometimes Devoted players kind of move around a little bit.
And then they have the Addict, who is a very dark subset, they say, of the Devoted Gamer group.
The Addict, who gets into one MMORPG and gets addicted to... You know where I'm going with this, right?
Because Jamie always used to say, whenever we would talk about Final Fantasy XI.
The Pretend Hardcore Gamer Casual Gamers
Casual gamers tend to play only those games that get good reviews.
and sell a lot of copies.
And lastly, I'm sorry, almost last, the clueless gamer.
Clueless gamers buy a lot of games where they're not really good at any of them and they give up on them before they become good.
These are the gamers who do things that puzzle you, make a lot of mistakes and get pretty frustrated by that, but also aren't willing to listen to suggestions or take any time to improve.
And then lastly, the worthless gamer.
Cheaters, hackers, de-levelers, punks, jackasses,
All that stuff.
The people that just go in there to ruin games.
The worthless gamer.
Which gamer are you?
Hardcore, devoted, pretend hardcore, casual, clueless, worthless.
Loki.
Hardcore and worthless.
Why is this?
I have to know my game knowledge just for working here.
I play a lot of games during the week.
Not as much as I used to, but I still play.
I always have a game system with me.
DarkSakura
The categories, just to give me... Sure, hardcore, devoted, pretend hardcore, casual, clueless, worthless.
I'd say hardcore for the old school stuff, just because you know my collection.
Right.
I totally can't see them.
Hardcore, devoted, pretend hardcore, casual, clueless, worthless.
I'd say I'm pretty devoted to once I get to playing something, because I like to finish it.
I'm definitely not a major cheater.
Well, okay.
I do cheat my way through Silent Hill 3 just because I'm not really playing it for the gameplay.
I'm playing it for the story.
And the sexy beam.
The heza beam!
It's the heza beam.
But that's just...
Nerd Gamer
You sound a little bit like a cross between hardcore and devoted to me.
A little bit.
I would say, I'm kind of somewhere between, you know what's weird is that I think I'm kind of like half devoted, half clueless.
The only reason I say I'm clueless is because I'm notorious for my gaming ADD where I will play one game for like a little bit of time and then I go to something else.
Like I lose interest and I go to something else.
But,
When I get devoted into a game, I get really devoted to the game.
And I'd say in a way, I just don't think I'm to the line where I can really call myself hardcore.
I feel that I do know a lot about games and stuff, but I realize that there's a whole world outside of that too.
So I don't know if I can really call myself hardcore.
I'm somewhere between there.
Because I'd say I'm very devoted to a lot of games too.
There's some games that I can never put down.
But there's other games I just bounce around a whole awful lot.
So I'm somewhere in there.
If you guys want to read the whole article and figure out which one of those you are, TooOldToPlay.com Up next on the show, we're going to take your calls right now on the Skype line.
For those of you guys that are listening live, www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com and click on Interact With Us and you can get all the details on how to call the show via the Skype line.
So am I the one to call or what?
Are you what?
The 100th caller?
Are you the 100th caller?
No, you're the first caller tonight.
What's on your mind?
Dan, it's Ranma.
I was hoping I'd get a free toaster out of this.
We might be able to hook you up with that anyway.
I'll bring you a toaster.
I'll bring you a Hello Kitty toaster.
We'll send you a Linux toaster.
When I come out for AkatsuCon, I'll bring a Hello Kitty toaster.
I'm giving it to my sister at DarkSakura.
I already showed you Linux on a toaster.
I know.
I saw it.
First off, I have to ask you, DJ Ranma S, what kind of gamer are you?
I'm the casual gamer, okay?
Here's a quick example of the hardcore gamer.
My friend got Kingdom Hearts 2.
He beat the game in two weeks.
That's hardcore.
Yes.
That's almost addiction, but does your other friend go outside and hug a tree once in a while?
Actually, no.
Well, then maybe he's addicted.
I don't know.
All right, enough about your friend, though.
What made you want to call in tonight?
I just wanted to say what's up, how you guys doing, and how much I love the show so far.
Well, thank you so much.
We appreciate the occasional compliment call.
It's good.
We're doing good.
I'd say I'm doing pretty well.
We've been doing a lot of venting tonight, which is good.
Oh, I heard.
As soon as I got home from Jersey, I jumped onto the stream.
I heard DarkSakura foaming at the mouth about a DarkSakura president.
What do you think about the whole Flowers for Jack Thompson campaign?
I have better things to do with $20.
I mean...
Let the little maggot run his mouth.
I don't care.
He's not going to stop me from buying the game.
There you go.
You can put the $20 down towards the game.
That's a very good point.
And if he somehow makes it that a game is not coming out, don't worry.
Somebody will find a way, and we'll have it.
Very true.
Very true.
Anything else you want to share with our callers tonight, DJ Ranma S?
Basically, earlier about the whole Jared Nintendo thing being fat, whatever.
Look, get up.
Go outside and play.
Don't you think they blew his quote a little bit out of context, though?
Do you think you really meant it?
It's the media.
It's the media.
They always blow shit out of proportion.
Well, true.
I can agree with you there.
I just let it go, and I just do my thing, and it's good.
All right.
Sounds good.
Ranma, thank you so much for the call.
We appreciate it, okay?
No problem.
You got it.
Later.
Take care, buddy.
All right.
Let's go to another call.
Hello.
You're on Orange Launch Radio.
Oh, hey.
Hi.
Who's this?
Um...
This is Keith, I'm Ranma, or I'm Ranma on the forums.
Alright, Keith, turn down your stream going out.
Yeah, I did.
Okay, what time do you mind?
Actually, I was going to ask you guys a question, since I know that you guys originally started out as really a Bimani radio, a music games podcast radio thing.
I wanted to ask, what are your favorite songs to DDR to?
Arena of Sorrow Max 2
My favorite old school song is Oh Nick Please Not So Quick, because you know, erotic, awesome.
Say what you want, don't hate, don't hate, that song's awesome.
And my favorite new school song is Skulk by Echo Image in DDR Ultramix 2, because that song is awesome.
I love that song, it like totally breathed new life into DDR, love it.
Let's go to another call, see if we have some luck over here.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
It's Legend of Zaku, what's up boss?
Hello Zaku, what's on your mind?
Hey, did you know we got your poster?
Yeah, I sent it over a month ago.
Anyways, I finally got 2DX.
I know, it was so late.
It was so late in the game because I was so poor, but I managed to find the money.
No, we love it.
We love the poster.
It's so awesome.
It's hanging here in the studio.
It's an In The Groove 2 signed poster.
If you listen to our old show, like the old live show we did, you'll understand why that's hilarious.
But for now, Zaku, I've got to keep it moving.
What brings you to call tonight?
Well, if I got 2DX and all, I'm just trying to break into it.
Any advice?
Because I just started playing that, you know, I think a couple of weeks ago.
And so far, I've pretty much poured out 9th style to, you know, to its
2DX Beat Mania
For years now, there's a whole lot of these games out in Japan.
It started with 3rd style, don't ask, but it started with 3rd style and all the way through 10th style now and supposedly 2DX Red on the way as well, which was 11th style, for lack of a better term.
A whole lot of these games out there with a hardcore following and finally we're going to be getting a version of it here in America soon.
As far as getting started with it, I think the best way to learn
I don't think they still have this in the newer styles, but in 5th style and 6th style they had what was called a drill mode, and it would show you how to do certain key patterns, and of course the game uses a turntable and white and black keys, so you play rhythms and make your own beats.
And the old 5th and 6th have drill mode, which I think is a great way to learn how to play the game, and sometimes it can be really obnoxious because you have to do a lot of repetition, but it's really good.
It gets you really good at the game.
Yeah.
Yeah, I think I should have gotten that because, you know, 9th style doesn't really have that much except for beginner mode.
The only thing I'm trying to do right now is trying to do the ranking.
Does Nightstyle have the mode where you can practice the song and slow it down?
Yeah, you have those modes where you can actually practice measures in training mode.
That's the best way to do it when there's lack of a drill mode.
Take a song you can almost pass and slow it down in that mode and work at it, because most of Beatmania is just hearing the rhythms in your head and knowing when to hit the keys, and that's really the best way to be good at it.
Anything else on your mind, Zaku?
We've got to keep it moving, but...
Alright, I guess, you know, just saying what's up and everything.
Alright, what type of gamer are you?
Basically, I don't think I call myself casual, but I'm like up there.
Not hardcore, not really casual, but in the middle.
Like devoted?
I pretty much have an open mind on many games.
Would you say you're devoted?
Sort of, I mean, with DDR, yes, and with Bomani also.
And then, you know, I also have my first person shooters and my ROMs.
and all the other internet things.
Yeah, you sound devoted to me.
You're devoted.
I hear my W devoted.
All right.
Sakura, thanks so much for the call.
Take care.
Yeah, anytime, man.
Later.
All right, thank you guys for your calls.
We appreciate that.
We're going to keep things moving here on Orange Launch Radio tonight, but of course we appreciate the calls as always.
If we have time later in the show, I don't know if we will tonight, but we'll take more calls a little later.
Moving on, though, we've got other news, starting off with PlayStation 3 news.
Jamie, you have some news on the PlayStation 3?
I do indeed.
Actually, there's a...
It has been predicted that an analyst by the name of Evan Wilson has predicted that the PS3 will launch in November in North America with a summer launch in Japan followed by a March 2007 European launch.
However, this conflicts with what a lot of the analysts over here are saying regarding when it's going to be out.
However,
He's actually gone on, this analyst has gone on to predict volumes for the system as well.
He believes that the PS3 will have a million units in Japan in the summer with similar volumes in the US in November.
And again, a similar number for the European market.
And that it's basically going to exceed the Xbox 360.
All right.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Okay, basically, the Japanese PlayStation site put up a few links to six games they had up on their site, and then took them down without explanation.
So, was it that they said, huh, maybe we shouldn't put them out and just hope they don't notice, or...
GameIndustry.biz got something out of a Sony spokesperson that said, we're working on the launch of the PS3 and confirmed a list of titles that will be announced at the appropriate time.
I guess that wasn't it, was it?
Do you remember what any of those titles were?
Sure.
According to one of my sources, there was...
Genji 2, Angel Rings, Monster Carnival, Everybody's Golf 5, Gran Turismo, and Eye of Judgment.
Gran Turismo will be a pretty sweet launch title in this country, I know that.
Some we do know of, though, is Metal Gear Solid 4.
There was a demo of a Tekken game.
And there's still speculation regarding the Final Fantasy franchise.
Hmm.
Very interesting.
Also, there is in development a version of Unreal Tournament 2007.
Awesome.
I also can confirm this, there was another story that ran on Joystick.com earlier this week Virtua Fighter 5 for PlayStation 3 has been confirmed and it's actually coming from this month's issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly Virtua Fighter 5 is coming to the PS3 and it might be exclusive and then there's a sexy little screenshot but I don't know if that's actually from the game or just something the site put to kind of tag that with but certainly fans of Virtua Fighter of which I know one, and she's in the room
No.
I thought you liked Virtua Fighter.
I loathe Virtua Fighter.
Oh, wow.
Okay, then I don't know anyone who likes Virtua Fighter, I guess.
I'm the Tekken fangirl.
I know you like... I thought for some reason you were also... I get the Sega thing.
Virtua Fighter made me gag so much when the first ones were out, I was not able to enjoy the series ever since.
I'll tell you what Virtua Fighter made me gag.
Virtua Fighter 2 on the Genesis, where they took it and made it 2D.
Exactly.
Except Virtua Fighter Kids was kind of fun.
Alright, let's talk more PlayStation 3.
Loki, you have some stories about, like, there was, like, a survey going on with PS3?
Yeah, there's a survey that's been around, going around, too, basically, because I don't know if anyone's actually played online with the PlayStation 2.
It's basically a big clusterfuck of, you know, what's going on.
They don't really have a system, it's just kind of out there, and the original idea for Sony for the PlayStation 3 was, hey, it worked before, let's go ahead and do it again, and they're kind of looking at it like,
Maybe we should come out with something like Xbox Live.
Anyways, so the thing that's going around right now is there are about 33 questions or so asking different things.
Like, for example, some things they hint at.
A specific lobby only for adults.
Would that be something that you'd be interested in?
With the sexy iToy plugin.
iToy plugin for game lobbies.
USB keyboard support.
Just, you know, all the standard stuff that you pretty much see in Xbox Live.
They're asking, hey, you want this?
You know, that type of thing.
Which, I mean, begs the question, if they're not going to have USB keyboard support, then why the hell do they have so many USB ports on the goddamn thing anyways?
That's what I want to know.
So, of course they're going to have USB support for the, you know, keyboard.
So that's something that's kind of going on right now, friends lists and whatnot, so.
Be interesting.
Alright, now, moving on.
I think this is PlayStation 3 related.
Something about Pioneer?
Yeah, Pioneer, the people making the Blu-ray player, they threw out some crazy numbers for what they thought the PS3 launch was going to be.
And this, I had to laugh.
See, originally, the estimates were 1 million units for launch in the United States.
Well, Pioneer is saying that they are going to have as many as 7 million units available for launch in
Right.
That's a lot of overtime.
I don't think so.
I mean, let's put it this way.
Unless they're planning on launching in 2009, that ain't going to happen.
We'll see.
All right.
Moving on to a completely different topic, but this is somewhat PlayStation related, but it's also Xbox related.
New homebrew for the PSP that's not Tetris?
Yes.
This homebrew is actually a port of a PC game, which is also a kind of a knockoff of Geometry Wars.
It's Vector and Vector for the PSP.
Very similar to Geometry Wars in the way it plays.
Of course, the control scheme is a little bit not as good.
as the 360 because you don't have the dual analog on a PSP.
But it's really awesome.
It's only available, though, for the 1.5 firmware, so hopefully you've got that or you can downgrade.
And it's available on your various PSP sites like PSP Updates.
Very cool.
So for those folks that can't get your Xbox 360 to play Geometry Wars, maybe this is a good substitute.
Exactly.
And if for whatever reason you can't get a version for the PSP,
Remember, there's still the PC version of the game, which is available at bagfullofwrong.co.uk slash games slash vector.html Alright.
Now, moving on.
Loki, you had some news on Majesco.
Something was going on with Majesco.
Majesco's getting out of the hardcore gaming business.
Basically, they're not making any more...
Aeon Flux Aeon Flux
Well, that answers a lot.
They've canned a couple of the games already.
What was in progress?
Taxi Driver and Demonic.
Oh, that's right.
I remember reading the report on Taxi Driver now.
Yeah, they're not doing too well as far as stuff that's coming out.
I know some of their games are being pulled, but it's probably just they're just looking, you know, self-preservation, so... Yeah.
Alright.
Speaking of things gone bad...
Majesco did Psychonauts
Electronic Gaming Monthly, the worst 10, not the top 10, but the worst 10 games ever reviewed.
Batman Beyond, number 10, for the PS1.
Who Wants to Beat Up a Millionaire on the Dreamcast?
That was hilarious.
That game was fun.
Got a 1.0 score.
Powerpuff Girls Paint the Townsville Green for the Game Boy Color.
And then right behind that at number 7, Powerpuff Girls Bad Mojo Jojo, also for the Game Boy Color.
It was also in the same issue.
Kiss Pinball for the PlayStation 1 was number 6.
I remember that.
The Psycho Circus game.
Urban Champion E.
Which was for the Game Boy Advance.
For some reason, I think they re-released this on the Advance.
It was one of their games they put on the Advance.
Urban Champion?
That game sucked balls on Nintendo.
It's like Nintendo's little blemish of the 8-bit era.
I mean, who remembers Urban Champion?
I mean, like, Hogan's Alley, awesome.
Other games, other 8-bit classics made by Nintendo that were forgotten about like that were awesome.
But Urban Champion?
Easy, forgotten.
4.
The Guy Game, Loki, Rebuttal, 3.
Mortal Kombat Advance, 4.
Number two, the number two worst game of all time, according to an EGM list here on 1up.com, The Flintstones Bedrock Bowling.
There's a reason why I never heard of that game, apparently.
Here's the number one worst game of all time reviewed on EGM, and it's a game I own because it was a gift.
Ping Pals for the Nintendo DS was the worst reviewed game of all time.
and rightfully so in many ways because Pink Pals kind of sucks.
Loki, you're shaking your head.
No, I think there's a worse game out there.
What's that?
This is basically the manos, the hands of fate for PC games.
It's called Big Rigs.
If you go to GameSpot.com and look for the review on Big Rigs, the game came out... Now, this is not the same as Big Mother Truckers.
No, this isn't the same as Big Mother Truckers.
You came out... It's a Big Rigs racing game, and the AI doesn't move.
The other cars don't move, so it's impossible for you to lose a race.
The physics aren't there.
You fall through bridges.
You can drive off the map.
There is no limit to your acceleration, so you can hold down and go a million miles an hour...
I was gonna go around and ask, what do you think were things that they missed on this list?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
There were games I thought were overrated.
I mean, certainly, I like Ridge Racer a whole bunch, but I thought Ridge Racer 6 was kind of overrated.
I can't say that there's any that I really dislike that I actually played, put effort into.
Fair enough, fair enough.
Alright.
Oh yeah, Smackdown vs. Raw on the PSP because it gave a noise the hell out of me.
Some comments from the chat room.
Some folks there are putting in their own two cents here.
Funnydale says, Worst game of all time, Back to the Future for the NES.
Back to the Future 2 and 3.
E.T.
on the 2600.
I actually played E.T.
on the 2600 when I was like six years old and found it entertaining.
But of course I was six years old, so you know.
And the Smurfs on Click Division.
The Smurfs was badass.
Hey, I love the Smurfs game.
I played that all the time when I was like four.
MagMax on the NES.
How about Night Trap?
What's her face?
Dana Plato?
Yeah, I know, and she's dead now.
Let's see.
Raj says, Barney's Hide and Seek for the Sega Genesis.
I got one.
Spice World.
I got one.
Spice World's awesome.
Non-stop hilarity.
Street Fighter 2, the movie, the game.
Oh, that takes the cake there.
Let's see.
Raj says, But But Shaq Fu.
Shaq Fu Carnival
DarkSakura, Japanese Language is Cake
Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
I'm just teasing.
Well, here's a way you can learn Japanese the fun way.
Right, Loki?
What's the fun way to learn Japanese?
This is learn Japanese with Knuckles.
Knuckles from the Sonic franchise.
Oh, you mean the Knuckles on my hand?
Like, if you get the question wrong, pow!
I hit you.
No, as in Sonic and Knuckles.
Anyways, they have this homemade RPG called Knuckles in China Land, which I don't understand why it's China Land if you're learning Japanese, but whatever.
Anyways, basically, you can...
They have all of the Hiragana and Katakana symbols in there as well as 6000 kanji and you can actually learn using this game and you can find it at www.kicl.info and it's a free download of course and go check it out.
Awesome.
The other things, let's see here.
Wait, I just have to say Super Pitfall for the NES.
Tarnished the Pitfall name.
That game is garbage.
Absolute garbage.
I got it as a present from a family member who didn't know much about games.
It was garbage.
How about the Sega CD version of Dragon's Lair that was missing scenes?
How about anything on the 3DO?
The Zelda game that wasn't a Zelda game.
Anything on the 3DO.
Actually, didn't 3DO have the racing game?
Well, forget it.
And was anything on the Jaguar with the exception of Tempest 2000?
What was it?
Tempest X and Defender 2000.
Alright.
Okay.
What else?
A couple more things real quick.
Sure.
This is just hitting the web right now.
Multitheft Auto San Andreas 1.0 has finally been released.
The PC version of Grand Theft Auto that they've modded to allow multiplayer games in, which I think they should have done from the start.
It's available right now if you go to lite.mtavc.com MTA as in Multitheft Auto San Andreas
ViceCity.com You can check it out.
Looks like it's going to be pretty good.
Lots of mirror servers right now because it's being hammered to death but if it's anything like Multitheft Auto, ViceCity it's going to be amazing.
So yeah.
One last thing of course we've got and we mentioned this before.
It's eBay for Animal Crossing.
Yes, all those people out there that just really want
I gotta have the Metroid.
I must have the Metroid.
It's amazing.
All right.
Well, we're about ready to wrap up the show here, but I have to respond to a chatter real quick because we do have this interactive thing going on.
Funny Dale says in the chat room here, I got news for you, Sky.
All Pitfall games that came out after the first one have charnished the name of Pitfall.
No, no, no, no.
Pitfall 2, the Mayan Caverns on Atari 2600, one of the only Atari 2600 games to feature background music.
That game was badass.
I enjoy it more than the first one, but the first one is a legendary game.
I do love that game a lot, so I have to disagree with you there, but maybe you just forgot, so I'll let it slide.
But yeah, a lot of the other ones that came out after that were garbage, but we'll see.
Anyway, that's all I have to say.
Loki, any last-minute stories?
I notice you're ruffling through the pages of the internet right now.
Yeah, well, just a little fun little thing here.
They have... Everybody loves, you know, the prince from Katamari.
and now you can make your very own prints to put on your desktop at work.
They have a paper model actually you can download and print out and make.
It's at fccafe.fc2web.com slash ptamacy.html and go check it out and they've got your own little prints for you.
Cute.
Alright, it's time to wrap it up.
I think we've had ourselves a good show tonight, and I think it's time to end it.
So now it's time to get our final thoughts.
Next week on the program, everybody, we're going to have an interview.
I think it is happening for sure next week.
It's going to be awesome.
We're having a rep from GameTap here, the service that we talked about a couple shows ago.
Going to be talking about GameTap and the plans for the future.
Should be awesome, so stay tuned for that.
That'll be next week here on the show.
Other exciting interviews coming up soon, we hope.
We'll see what happens.
Now let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
Loki, your final thought.
My final thought is I'm going to actually play through all of Ridge Racer so I can get good to play online.
Ridge Racer 6, of course.
My final thought is I'm craving to go play some Pitfall 2 very soon because I thought about that game just now with this show and it was so awesome.
DarkSakura.
And that's another one of those games that look better on the Commodore 64 than it did on Atari, just so you know.
DarkSakura.
Tonight we hook up the duo and actually play Space Fantasy Zone.
You have to tell us about it next week.
I will.
I'll give my review.
All right.
That's it from us here at Orange Lounge Radio to you guys.
Have a wonderful week and we'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.
