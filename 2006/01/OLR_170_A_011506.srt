00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:20,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio Good evening everybody, welcome to Orange Lounge Radio episode number 170 for this January the 15th of 2006

2
00:00:41,846 --> 00:00:44,327
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, it's our first show of the new format.

3
00:00:44,347 --> 00:00:48,649
[SPEAKER_04]: We've kind of taken our live show and our podcast and sort of combined the two together.

4
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:53,791
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're wondering, hey, wait a minute, when the hell did things go from episode 54 to 170?

5
00:00:54,391 --> 00:01:01,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's because we here at Orange Ones Radio have actually been doing a live program for the past three years solely dedicated to music and rhythm games.

6
00:01:02,314 --> 00:01:08,737
[SPEAKER_04]: But tonight the show has come together for the first time to allow our listeners to actually interact with the program as well.

7
00:01:08,817 --> 00:01:09,717
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts.

8
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:10,718
[SPEAKER_04]: You might know me as Sky.

9
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:14,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Joining me, as always, say hello to DarkSakura.

10
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:14,860
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?

11
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,481
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, what am I not doing?

12
00:01:17,561 --> 00:01:18,461
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, how am I doing?

13
00:01:18,501 --> 00:01:19,062
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.

14
00:01:20,322 --> 00:01:21,663
[SPEAKER_00]: Fairly decent.

15
00:01:22,003 --> 00:01:22,283
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah?

16
00:01:22,443 --> 00:01:23,684
[SPEAKER_00]: Fairly decent, I can say.

17
00:01:23,904 --> 00:01:24,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

18
00:01:24,504 --> 00:01:24,844
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

19
00:01:25,065 --> 00:01:25,765
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing over there?

20
00:01:25,925 --> 00:01:27,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, our other co-host, Tech Master Loki.

21
00:01:28,126 --> 00:01:28,886
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing good.

22
00:01:29,427 --> 00:01:29,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

23
00:01:29,767 --> 00:01:30,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.

24
00:01:30,947 --> 00:01:32,368
[SPEAKER_04]: And since we have...

25
00:01:33,795 --> 00:01:34,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Shane Miklatov

26
00:01:57,461 --> 00:01:58,702
[SPEAKER_04]: I just got hit by a blue shell.

27
00:01:59,002 --> 00:02:02,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you playing Mario Kart during the show?

28
00:02:02,324 --> 00:02:02,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

29
00:02:02,845 --> 00:02:03,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

30
00:02:03,645 --> 00:02:18,335
[SPEAKER_04]: For those that don't know Miklatov, since he's kind of new to our podcast listeners, Shane's an old friend of ours that actually, now he works for Konami, but with all those NDAs, we're not allowed to say what he does or what he's doing or any of that stuff, right?

31
00:02:18,355 --> 00:02:22,657
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look at instruction manuals for games, you can totally find out what I do and what I'm doing.

32
00:02:23,098 --> 00:02:24,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

33
00:02:24,499 --> 00:02:26,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kind of look at it, but it doesn't say Miklatov, right?

34
00:02:28,317 --> 00:02:29,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Ultramix 3 does.

35
00:02:29,778 --> 00:02:30,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it?

36
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:30,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

37
00:02:31,899 --> 00:02:33,579
[SPEAKER_04]: So can you tell us what you did for Ultramix 3?

38
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Steps.

39
00:02:37,001 --> 00:02:41,002
[SPEAKER_04]: So when people play DDR, you create the steps they dance to?

40
00:02:41,102 --> 00:02:41,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I do.

41
00:02:42,023 --> 00:02:42,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

42
00:02:43,024 --> 00:02:46,905
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, we are interactive with our chat room and our Skype line tonight.

43
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,285
[SPEAKER_04]: www.orangeloungeradio.com.

44
00:02:49,305 --> 00:02:52,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Click on Interact With Us to get more information on joining the chat room.

45
00:02:52,786 --> 00:02:59,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, since the show is podcast as well, you guys really can't interact with us if you're listening through the podcast stream.

46
00:02:59,247 --> 00:03:01,047
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just incentive to be here on Sunday nights.

47
00:03:02,488 --> 00:03:08,729
[SPEAKER_04]: But, of course, you can always drop in there because we have other live shows that go on throughout the week, and it's a good time.

48
00:03:09,716 --> 00:03:10,596
[SPEAKER_04]: It is our first show.

49
00:03:10,656 --> 00:03:12,157
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm feeling a little good about this.

50
00:03:12,197 --> 00:03:14,698
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of a change going on here.

51
00:03:15,658 --> 00:03:19,340
[SPEAKER_04]: At the same time, I'm a little nervous, but I'm hoping you guys like the change.

52
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,600
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm feeling good about the change, though.

53
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,761
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you guys think?

54
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:22,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you happy with this?

55
00:03:23,347 --> 00:03:28,168
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, no, I'm just depressed as I can be, and my heart is broken.

56
00:03:28,868 --> 00:03:29,588
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel awful.

57
00:03:29,948 --> 00:03:31,248
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm actually pretty happy with it.

58
00:03:31,548 --> 00:03:33,249
[SPEAKER_04]: A piece of you has died inside.

59
00:03:33,929 --> 00:03:36,809
[SPEAKER_04]: My soul is dark and empty!

60
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:51,512
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the biggest shock will probably come to people that have listened on the podcast, because we had such a, you know, like, da-da-da-da-da-da, like, we were always just, like, going down this bullet list of things, but now we have a little time to relax, because we're going to be two hours now, so our podcast is broken up into sections, which means you'll get it

61
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,651
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, how's your gaming week been?

62
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:54,712
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd have to say it's been pretty lame.

63
00:03:54,732 --> 00:03:55,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is that?

64
00:03:55,332 --> 00:03:59,296
[SPEAKER_04]: All I've played is Animal Crossing just because I'm getting ready to start my next semester.

65
00:03:59,396 --> 00:04:01,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Next week, God help me.

66
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:29,451
[SPEAKER_01]: That and I have a pretty nasty sinus infection so I've been getting motion sick every time I play anything Even Animal Crossing, doesn't that suck?

67
00:04:30,613 --> 00:04:32,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion sick playing Animal Crossing?

68
00:04:32,876 --> 00:04:33,918
[SPEAKER_01]: Fluid in my head

69
00:04:35,003 --> 00:04:37,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Something that you don't really hear a lot about sometimes.

70
00:04:37,325 --> 00:04:43,010
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we always see those warnings before we start to play video games, but we never really hear about a lot of experiences.

71
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:47,193
[SPEAKER_01]: I am one of those people who gets motion sick playing first person shooters or watching them.

72
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:49,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever taken things to try it?

73
00:04:49,835 --> 00:04:51,517
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how people get cars to take Dramamine?

74
00:04:51,537 --> 00:04:57,382
[SPEAKER_01]: Dramamine is like, it makes you pass out and it's really nasty stuff and not good for you at all.

75
00:04:58,055 --> 00:05:02,036
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried taking Ginger before trying to play Goldeneye back on the N64.

76
00:05:02,576 --> 00:05:05,357
[SPEAKER_01]: Goldeneye is the first video game I've ever played that made me throw up.

77
00:05:06,877 --> 00:05:07,757
[SPEAKER_04]: That's hardcore, though.

78
00:05:08,137 --> 00:05:18,619
[SPEAKER_01]: I was watching Dan play it, and I wanted to do the two-person, but also if the screen is split like that with the two-person mode, I can't do it even more, even on PSO.

79
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,060
[SPEAKER_01]: Sonic Adventure made me nauseous.

80
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,092
[SPEAKER_01]: But I love that game and I just sort of push through it.

81
00:05:24,272 --> 00:05:29,196
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, is there ever a point where you're just like, screw it, I'll just get sick just to play this game?

82
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:31,578
[SPEAKER_01]: Katamari Damashii makes me very motion sick.

83
00:05:31,738 --> 00:05:36,863
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like how I get sick if I eat really spicy foods, but once in a while it's like, screw it, I want Mongolian barbecue, I want it all.

84
00:05:37,443 --> 00:05:41,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I did actually start to put Beatmania in and then Dan got sick.

85
00:05:43,088 --> 00:05:45,990
[SPEAKER_01]: He turns into such a baby when he's sick.

86
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,352
[SPEAKER_04]: But he's not motion sick, he's like virus sick.

87
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:51,838
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's got the flu or something.

88
00:05:52,498 --> 00:05:53,118
[SPEAKER_01]: He's feeling better.

89
00:05:53,758 --> 00:06:04,082
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did play DDR at Fry's today, and whatever ignition pad, fake pad thing they have there is a piece of ass, as in a skanky piece of ass.

90
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:07,663
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like, right in the middle, you know where you stand?

91
00:06:07,683 --> 00:06:09,004
[SPEAKER_01]: It's where the left arrow was.

92
00:06:09,687 --> 00:06:10,868
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

93
00:06:34,693 --> 00:06:36,114
[SPEAKER_04]: We are international!

94
00:06:56,448 --> 00:06:59,049
[SPEAKER_04]: And I shouldn't be giving them free advertising, but...

95
00:07:25,851 --> 00:07:27,072
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting an Intel iMac Jump to a Mac

96
00:07:46,013 --> 00:07:47,494
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, what planet are you from?

97
00:07:47,574 --> 00:07:50,156
[SPEAKER_04]: You can address those cards and letters to Loki at Orange Laundry.

98
00:07:50,176 --> 00:07:54,659
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have a system that will run circles around your PC.

99
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:56,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, look at all that Mac gaming out there.

100
00:07:57,001 --> 00:07:58,062
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, oh wait, I'm sorry.

101
00:07:58,262 --> 00:08:00,504
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me, I'm a graphic artist.

102
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:01,084
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello?

103
00:08:02,205 --> 00:08:03,466
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a graphic artist.

104
00:08:03,546 --> 00:08:05,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm glad it can do something.

105
00:08:06,108 --> 00:08:08,189
[SPEAKER_04]: You are so full of shit.

106
00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:10,371
[SPEAKER_04]: I love getting to start off the new show with a good fight.

107
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:12,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Jerry!

108
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Jerry!

109
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:22,604
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because he is holding on to this antiquated idea that a Macintosh is for losers when actually it is far superior to practically any PC.

110
00:08:22,704 --> 00:08:27,946
[SPEAKER_01]: And on top of that, I can install Windows on my damn Mac with my new iMac if I want to.

111
00:08:28,526 --> 00:08:28,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Breathe in.

112
00:08:29,147 --> 00:08:30,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Calm down.

113
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:30,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Breathe in.

114
00:08:31,168 --> 00:08:33,729
[SPEAKER_01]: What is this Dell crap popping up on my laptop anyway?

115
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:37,170
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I won't have to put up with Dell crap popping up on my computer anymore.

116
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:37,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Dell.

117
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:37,691
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

118
00:08:40,655 --> 00:08:42,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else to share about your gaming week?

119
00:08:43,376 --> 00:08:47,257
[SPEAKER_01]: I need some rope and a big stick and some fire.

120
00:08:47,797 --> 00:08:49,317
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to roast me a co-host.

121
00:08:49,517 --> 00:08:51,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

122
00:08:51,938 --> 00:08:53,238
[SPEAKER_05]: My gaming week was good.

123
00:08:54,638 --> 00:08:56,639
[SPEAKER_05]: I played a lot of Animal Crossing.

124
00:08:57,259 --> 00:09:01,620
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know because I'm too lazy to set up game systems to play any console systems or whatever.

125
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I played a little bit of Call of Duty 2.

126
00:09:07,121 --> 00:09:10,202
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm more of the single player and some of the multiplayer because it's just fun.

127
00:09:10,776 --> 00:09:11,877
[SPEAKER_05]: But I did buy more games.

128
00:09:11,957 --> 00:09:14,718
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought DOA 4, haven't played that yet.

129
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:18,441
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was trying to... Boobie Fight 2006?

130
00:09:18,621 --> 00:09:19,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

131
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:22,323
[SPEAKER_05]: It says it has partial nudity in it, which is pretty sweet.

132
00:09:22,723 --> 00:09:25,365
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very promising to have a game that has partial nudity in it.

133
00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:29,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Aren't some of those costumes just partial nudity on their own, though?

134
00:09:29,588 --> 00:09:29,808
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess.

135
00:09:29,828 --> 00:09:30,888
[SPEAKER_05]: It is kind of disappointing.

136
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:34,751
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still waiting for Rumble Runs' XX in a couple months.

137
00:09:34,891 --> 00:09:35,891
[SPEAKER_05]: That game's going to be hot.

138
00:09:36,512 --> 00:09:36,932
[SPEAKER_05]: So hot.

139
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:38,433
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got bears in it.

140
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:39,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

141
00:09:52,811 --> 00:09:57,675
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be that Final Fantasy XI beta that's going to be in the next official Xbox magazine.

142
00:09:58,155 --> 00:09:59,837
[SPEAKER_05]: So that should be coming out in a couple weeks.

143
00:10:00,037 --> 00:10:00,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that already out there?

144
00:10:00,857 --> 00:10:06,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm looking on message boards and I'm seeing... You know how a lot of people are using their little Xbox gamer cards and their signature now?

145
00:10:07,263 --> 00:10:11,326
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see the little boxes that show what accomplishments they've gotten lately?

146
00:10:11,346 --> 00:10:12,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you seen those with the stars?

147
00:10:12,947 --> 00:10:13,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

148
00:10:13,507 --> 00:10:20,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I saw somebody who's on a random message board the other day, because I lurk on a lot of message boards out there, and somebody had a Play Online square in theirs.

149
00:10:20,993 --> 00:10:21,714
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, wait a minute!

150
00:10:22,806 --> 00:10:23,587
[SPEAKER_04]: When did this happen?

151
00:10:23,727 --> 00:10:25,068
[SPEAKER_04]: When did the PlayOnline thing happen, Ari?

152
00:10:25,108 --> 00:10:26,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it might have already.

153
00:10:26,429 --> 00:10:26,870
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure.

154
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,392
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't really looked to see if the magazines are out there yet.

155
00:10:29,752 --> 00:10:33,255
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe it was the 16th is when the official newsstand date.

156
00:10:33,355 --> 00:10:34,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well then that would be tomorrow.

157
00:10:35,076 --> 00:10:35,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

158
00:10:35,717 --> 00:10:37,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, people get it early still.

159
00:10:37,258 --> 00:10:37,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

160
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:39,400
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.

161
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,923
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess the people that have subscriptions might have already gotten them already.

162
00:10:43,483 --> 00:10:46,866
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a subscription, but you know how it takes eight weeks and all that kind of crap.

163
00:10:47,266 --> 00:10:47,767
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um...

164
00:10:48,885 --> 00:10:50,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm looking forward to that stuff.

165
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,026
[SPEAKER_05]: But right now, I just haven't been playing too much.

166
00:10:52,306 --> 00:10:54,907
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to really get back into playing more console games.

167
00:10:55,407 --> 00:10:59,708
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some games coming out that I want to check out for the PlayStation 2 and stuff.

168
00:11:00,108 --> 00:11:06,910
[SPEAKER_05]: And I tried acquiring a game for the PSP, DJ Max, that beat Mania Korean Sim type thing.

169
00:11:08,471 --> 00:11:10,692
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a little bigger than my memory card.

170
00:11:13,452 --> 00:11:14,633
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually remembered one more thing.

171
00:11:14,933 --> 00:11:15,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm?

172
00:11:15,552 --> 00:11:25,339
[SPEAKER_01]: We were going to break out the Turbo Duo because I now have, thanks to one of our good listening friends, Space Fantasy Zone.

173
00:11:26,801 --> 00:11:29,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't that one of those games you kept saying you wanted?

174
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:31,184
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a prototype.

175
00:11:31,604 --> 00:11:32,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

176
00:11:32,365 --> 00:11:34,687
[SPEAKER_01]: And I now have Space Fantasy Zone.

177
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:42,312
[SPEAKER_01]: And Emerald Dragon, which actually I don't think I can play because I'd need to have an arcade card, which the Duo never had.

178
00:11:42,352 --> 00:11:44,414
[SPEAKER_01]: It had, I think, up to the second card.

179
00:11:44,775 --> 00:11:47,497
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means I actually have to find a DuoRX now to be able to play it.

180
00:11:48,537 --> 00:11:48,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

181
00:11:49,358 --> 00:11:50,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else in your gaming week, Loki?

182
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:52,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

183
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, my gaming week wasn't that exciting.

184
00:11:54,561 --> 00:11:55,702
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played a whole lot of new stuff.

185
00:11:55,722 --> 00:11:57,443
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing a lot of the same old stuff.

186
00:11:57,563 --> 00:12:09,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, we don't really get free copies of games from people, so whenever any of us talk about a new game we've played, most likely we have went out and bought it if we didn't borrow it from somebody or, I don't know, Loki hacked something.

187
00:12:10,872 --> 00:12:12,613
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know for me, I usually buy it.

188
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:21,681
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to add, just real quick, since you mentioned buying games, because I have been the bee in a company that sells games, I can use them as tax write-offs.

189
00:12:21,861 --> 00:12:24,061
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm writing off $900 worth of games this year.

190
00:12:24,141 --> 00:12:24,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Lucky you.

191
00:12:24,861 --> 00:12:25,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop rubbing it in.

192
00:12:25,922 --> 00:12:26,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

193
00:12:27,142 --> 00:12:29,142
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I've just been enjoying old games.

194
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:30,723
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been enjoying some of the greatest hits of 2005.

195
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,023
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been doing Animal Crossing and Meteos.

196
00:12:34,043 --> 00:12:35,604
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually got back into Meteos again and...

197
00:12:37,017 --> 00:12:44,104
[SPEAKER_04]: This dude over here in the corner got me suckered back into World of Warcraft, which I was going to cancel my account.

198
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:48,548
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Miklatov was like, no, you should come play on his server.

199
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:51,311
[SPEAKER_04]: So now I'm playing a Horde character.

200
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,333
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's interesting.

201
00:12:53,413 --> 00:12:54,354
[SPEAKER_04]: It's different than the Alliance.

202
00:12:54,605 --> 00:12:55,305
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you what I'll do.

203
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:55,805
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

204
00:12:56,185 --> 00:12:58,986
[SPEAKER_01]: I will go ahead and renew my World of Warcraft and I will play with you.

205
00:12:59,586 --> 00:12:59,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet!

206
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,467
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll make my zombie chick again.

207
00:13:02,927 --> 00:13:03,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds awesome.

208
00:13:03,527 --> 00:13:04,867
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm playing a troll.

209
00:13:05,227 --> 00:13:06,588
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm playing on Bronzebeard.

210
00:13:06,608 --> 00:13:07,908
[SPEAKER_01]: My zombie's on Bronzebeard.

211
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:08,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.

212
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,589
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to say what server, but I'll let you know offline.

213
00:13:11,949 --> 00:13:16,550
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care because I haven't touched the game in three months, but I'll play again if you're playing.

214
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,851
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

215
00:13:30,524 --> 00:13:32,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Still cannot find an Xbox 360.

216
00:13:32,766 --> 00:13:37,689
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been using that Best Buy locator thing we talked about a couple shows ago that you had in your live journal.

217
00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:41,491
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just driving around to random places, you would think.

218
00:13:41,692 --> 00:13:44,573
[SPEAKER_04]: I went Target, Walmart, Circuit City.

219
00:13:44,593 --> 00:13:46,315
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, no one shops at Circuit City anymore.

220
00:13:46,735 --> 00:13:48,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Yet somebody's buying up all their Xbox 360.

221
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,557
[SPEAKER_04]: At least in this area, nobody shops at Circuit City.

222
00:13:50,678 --> 00:13:51,698
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a ghost town all the time.

223
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:54,020
[SPEAKER_04]: But no Xbox 360s.

224
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,301
[SPEAKER_04]: They told me they wouldn't have new ones until February.

225
00:13:57,222 --> 00:13:58,062
[SPEAKER_04]: That could be about right.

226
00:13:58,163 --> 00:13:59,543
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to get my geometry wars on.

227
00:13:59,563 --> 00:14:00,144
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't fair.

228
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:04,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn you Microsoft for your supply shortage stuff

229
00:14:27,762 --> 00:14:28,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

230
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:55,627
[SPEAKER_04]: I urge everybody out there, do not support the Xbox 360 black market.

231
00:14:55,927 --> 00:15:02,271
[SPEAKER_04]: You are continuing to rob people like me of an Xbox 360 because that's who's buying them is people who wants to put them on eBay.

232
00:15:05,793 --> 00:15:13,378
[SPEAKER_04]: It's harder for me to get upset at the people that are buying them and putting them on eBay mostly because I know some people doing it even though I told them, you make me cry.

233
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,362
[SPEAKER_04]: If people weren't buying them and paying those hideous prices for them,

234
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:20,728
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

235
00:15:42,788 --> 00:15:45,729
[SPEAKER_06]: I finally passed 1,000 wins on Mario Kart DS.

236
00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:46,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Right on.

237
00:15:46,729 --> 00:15:49,890
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all we do at work on breaks is play Mario Kart DS.

238
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:51,491
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's pretty nice.

239
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:58,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than that, I sold Animal Crossing because I don't have time for it because I have Mario Kart.

240
00:15:58,393 --> 00:15:59,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because you're too busy with Mario Kart.

241
00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:00,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

242
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:05,535
[SPEAKER_06]: And I started playing World of Warcraft again and City of Heroes and Final Fantasy XI.

243
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,351
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm a big nerd.

244
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:09,811
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I do.

245
00:16:10,711 --> 00:16:18,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the listeners would kick my ass because you work for Konami, and I know you have all these non-disclosure agreements and stuff, but I have to ask.

246
00:16:18,814 --> 00:16:25,476
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to talk about this a little more in depth later in the show, but surely you have something you can say on DDR Supernova?

247
00:16:25,956 --> 00:16:28,757
[SPEAKER_04]: It's totally a DDR game that's for the arcades.

248
00:16:30,917 --> 00:16:32,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Bet you didn't know that.

249
00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:35,799
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, he ain't budging.

250
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:44,351
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have to get somebody from the higher-ups in Konami and Gorillam here on this show to figure out the details on what's going on with Supernova.

251
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:45,871
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk more about DDR Supernova.

252
00:16:46,611 --> 00:16:53,693
[SPEAKER_04]: I imagine most people, or a lot of people that listen to this show probably started on our music stuff, so they know we're really excited.

253
00:16:53,733 --> 00:17:03,255
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there was a lot of interesting talk in our forums and our LJ community live journal about, isn't it ironic that the week after Orange Lounge says...

254
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:06,140
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to do the Bomani stuff anymore.

255
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Suddenly, doo-doo, we've got a brand new DDR game in arcades.

256
00:17:13,801 --> 00:17:21,443
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like we're going to stop talking about Bomani and music-based games at all, because they're still really important, obviously, and we still really love them a lot.

257
00:17:21,483 --> 00:17:24,664
[SPEAKER_04]: We just don't want to only talk about that anymore.

258
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:25,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

259
00:17:26,384 --> 00:17:28,285
[SPEAKER_01]: There is more to life than to DDR.

260
00:17:28,485 --> 00:17:29,165
[SPEAKER_04]: There is, there is.

261
00:17:29,225 --> 00:17:32,986
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gaming fans first, music game fans second, so that's an important thing to remember.

262
00:17:33,829 --> 00:17:40,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, before we get into tonight's news, we want to say a big special extra hugs and thank yous to Middyhead, speaking of DDR.

263
00:17:41,174 --> 00:17:47,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Middyhead created songs, you know, he's been a musician for a while and does stuff for TV and movies.

264
00:17:47,198 --> 00:17:47,758
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty cool.

265
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:51,201
[SPEAKER_04]: But he also did some songs that turned out in DDR and some remixes.

266
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,282
[SPEAKER_04]: He also did our brand new intro you heard tonight.

267
00:17:53,602 --> 00:17:55,503
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was very nice of him to do that.

268
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:56,584
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it a whole lot.

269
00:17:56,664 --> 00:17:57,405
[SPEAKER_04]: It was awesome.

270
00:17:57,485 --> 00:18:00,587
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want more information on his music, you like that little...

271
00:18:01,227 --> 00:18:02,127
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff we had in the beginning.

272
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:05,109
[SPEAKER_04]: MidiHead.com is his website with more information, so it's pretty cool.

273
00:18:06,129 --> 00:18:08,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, let's get into some gaming news tonight.

274
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:12,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, what's going on with the Xbox 360?

275
00:18:12,111 --> 00:18:17,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of how I can't find one, and they've had these sales goals and all this stuff, what's up with this?

276
00:18:18,073 --> 00:18:25,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, first off, basically, it's just been a nightmare trying to find a 360 and that type of stuff, but...

277
00:18:27,364 --> 00:18:31,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now they've sold about 600,000 units in the United States.

278
00:18:31,988 --> 00:18:41,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, that's quite short to their original goal of 3 million in three months, being that we're on month two here, and 600,000.

279
00:18:42,035 --> 00:18:53,084
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, they actually went back on their original announcement that they were going to do 3 million, and now have kind of updated that to 5.5 to 6 million units by June 30th.

280
00:18:54,304 --> 00:19:00,390
[SPEAKER_04]: So now it's kind of like, oh, we're just going to put the finish line further out there so we can sell more.

281
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,412
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the problem is, are they going to make 3 million units in 90 days?

282
00:19:04,153 --> 00:19:05,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they even going to be able to produce them?

283
00:19:06,255 --> 00:19:16,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the problem was before, and the whole thing that kind of delayed stuff, was that they ran into the problem, of course, with the overheating GPUs and that type of thing.

284
00:19:16,584 --> 00:19:20,768
[SPEAKER_05]: And because of that, they've had to do more quality control and kind of,

285
00:19:21,445 --> 00:19:23,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Just basically slow down the whole process.

286
00:19:23,406 --> 00:19:32,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Now they've added another manufacturing plant and they've kind of ironed out this overheating issue so hopefully they're going to be up to speed.

287
00:19:33,411 --> 00:19:35,012
[SPEAKER_05]: I still don't think they're going to make their goal though.

288
00:19:35,533 --> 00:19:36,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Not by a long shot.

289
00:19:39,955 --> 00:19:42,336
[SPEAKER_05]: So how many of these things have they actually sold since the launch?

290
00:19:42,937 --> 00:19:45,558
[SPEAKER_05]: As I said, 600,000 so far estimated.

291
00:19:45,938 --> 00:19:48,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Now there are other sources saying 1.3 million.

292
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,221
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go with the 600,000 though.

293
00:19:52,386 --> 00:19:53,847
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

294
00:19:54,747 --> 00:19:55,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Lowball it.

295
00:19:55,608 --> 00:19:56,768
[SPEAKER_04]: That way you don't get disappointed.

296
00:19:57,889 --> 00:19:59,030
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

297
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:03,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on in the news, you might have heard this week that Tetris DS was kind of a surprise announcement.

298
00:20:03,972 --> 00:20:05,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Tetris is going to be coming out for the Nintendo DS.

299
00:20:06,334 --> 00:20:15,259
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be coming out at the end of March, and it's going to support up to 10-player multiplayer, if you're all in the same room, 4-player Wi-Fi.

300
00:20:15,979 --> 00:20:18,201
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's still kind of cool that they're taking Tetris Wi-Fi.

301
00:20:18,681 --> 00:20:24,486
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, they're going to be incorporating old 8-bit Nintendo classics into this somehow.

302
00:20:24,526 --> 00:20:29,930
[SPEAKER_04]: If you see the early screenshots, you can see Mario Brothers and some things like that in the early screenshots.

303
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:32,472
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very interesting because we don't know yet exactly how that works.

304
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:37,056
[SPEAKER_04]: But we assume it has something to do with maybe the battle setup or something like that.

305
00:20:38,257 --> 00:20:40,478
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's just me, but I'm really excited about this.

306
00:20:40,498 --> 00:20:42,620
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, I'm a big puzzle game whore to begin with.

307
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,002
[SPEAKER_04]: So finally having Tetris on the DS is pretty cool.

308
00:20:46,838 --> 00:20:48,459
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't think it's good.

309
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:48,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

310
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Because 4-player ruined Mario Kart Online.

311
00:20:52,562 --> 00:20:54,363
[SPEAKER_06]: 4-player will ruin Tetris Online.

312
00:20:54,383 --> 00:20:59,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, wait, wait, this coming from the guy who just proudly proclaimed, I have a thousand wins!

313
00:20:59,226 --> 00:21:00,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, but that's not online.

314
00:21:00,807 --> 00:21:13,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Online mode for Mario Kart DS is really stupid, because one, it's hard to find 4-player sometimes, and two, if somebody doesn't get first, they turn off their system, and so then you're down to three, or two, or then just finally one.

315
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:15,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Tetranet Tetranet Tetranet

316
00:21:31,972 --> 00:21:33,453
[SPEAKER_04]: with the item usage and everything.

317
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,935
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the fact that it's online, it's that they're limiting it to four players.

318
00:21:37,115 --> 00:21:37,916
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my problem.

319
00:21:37,936 --> 00:21:39,437
[SPEAKER_01]: But wasn't Tetranet six?

320
00:21:39,937 --> 00:21:40,958
[SPEAKER_01]: Limited to six or four?

321
00:21:41,738 --> 00:21:43,460
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been so long since I played Tetranet.

322
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,062
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it was more than four, but I want to say it was like five or six was the most that you could have.

323
00:21:47,082 --> 00:21:48,483
[SPEAKER_01]: That's still not much more than four.

324
00:21:49,429 --> 00:21:49,629
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

325
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:50,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, ruin Mario Kart.

326
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,351
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't have high hopes for Tetris.

327
00:21:52,371 --> 00:21:53,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, wait a minute then.

328
00:21:53,252 --> 00:21:58,476
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're into this local area gaming thing, then doesn't the 10 player... Yeah, that's cool.

329
00:21:58,536 --> 00:21:58,916
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.

330
00:21:58,996 --> 00:22:05,301
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just, I'm sad that Nintendo has to go and either limitations on their software or whatever make it for players.

331
00:22:06,162 --> 00:22:09,724
[SPEAKER_06]: I just have bad experiences with Mario Kart online, so... It's probably the network.

332
00:22:09,904 --> 00:22:15,869
[SPEAKER_04]: But do you think Tetris is going to suffer from the same problem where people turn off their DSs if they lose too quick and then you have connection error...

333
00:22:17,372 --> 00:22:18,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably.

334
00:22:18,272 --> 00:22:20,673
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there are some people that are just that competitive.

335
00:22:20,853 --> 00:22:23,193
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they lose, they don't want it to count against their record.

336
00:22:23,694 --> 00:22:27,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Haven't I bought this game before like six, seven times already?

337
00:22:27,975 --> 00:22:29,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop making Tetris!

338
00:22:31,035 --> 00:22:32,416
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same damn game.

339
00:22:32,456 --> 00:22:34,656
[SPEAKER_05]: They haven't improved anything at all in this.

340
00:22:34,676 --> 00:22:36,797
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't need to have anything improved.

341
00:22:37,317 --> 00:22:38,497
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost the perfect game.

342
00:22:38,777 --> 00:22:40,958
[SPEAKER_01]: Tetris is like quack.

343
00:22:41,849 --> 00:22:45,751
[SPEAKER_05]: When are you going to get into a room with 10 people wanting to play Tetris at the same time?

344
00:22:45,951 --> 00:22:46,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Anime conventions.

345
00:22:47,031 --> 00:22:48,572
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I guarantee that.

346
00:22:49,232 --> 00:22:51,133
[SPEAKER_01]: Or no, get this.

347
00:22:53,854 --> 00:22:55,315
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine being on an airplane.

348
00:22:56,515 --> 00:23:00,257
[SPEAKER_01]: You're bored to death and random other people are playing Tetris and you can play Tetris with them.

349
00:23:00,597 --> 00:23:03,858
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the plane crashes because you're not supposed to play those wireless things.

350
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:05,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, yes, you can.

351
00:23:06,187 --> 00:23:06,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, that's right.

352
00:23:06,928 --> 00:23:07,788
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're in the air, you can.

353
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you're in the air, you can do it.

354
00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:09,669
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

355
00:23:10,129 --> 00:23:10,810
[SPEAKER_06]: It's totally true.

356
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:17,194
[SPEAKER_06]: The fourth time I saw Brokeback Mountain, we took our DSs in the theater and there were people playing Mario Kart.

357
00:23:17,214 --> 00:23:19,635
[SPEAKER_06]: So we played Mario Kart during the previews with people in the theater.

358
00:23:19,735 --> 00:23:22,437
[SPEAKER_06]: So Tetris really could work just randomly anywhere.

359
00:23:22,677 --> 00:23:24,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Imagine like a big sports game or a concert.

360
00:23:24,578 --> 00:23:25,499
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet it's the same deal.

361
00:23:25,699 --> 00:23:27,160
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done PictoChat standing in line.

362
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,721
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen lots of people do that too.

363
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:30,522
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's...

364
00:23:31,184 --> 00:23:31,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Crazy.

365
00:23:31,704 --> 00:23:35,627
[SPEAKER_04]: The last time I did the massive PictoChat where there was a lot of other people was E3.

366
00:23:36,007 --> 00:23:40,370
[SPEAKER_01]: I did PictoChat at E3 standing in the line to play Nintendogs.

367
00:23:42,512 --> 00:23:49,736
[SPEAKER_04]: I was doing it in the line waiting to get in, and I remember seeing all these people writing on their PictoChats, OMG, it's Gary Coleman, OMG, OMG.

368
00:23:50,037 --> 00:23:53,919
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I looked to my right, and sure enough, Gary Coleman's standing right there.

369
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:55,680
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, oh, OMG, it really is him.

370
00:23:56,021 --> 00:23:56,801
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just kind of funny.

371
00:23:56,981 --> 00:24:00,984
[SPEAKER_01]: I was doing PictoChat and saw a familiar name looked up, and it was Shark's Girl.

372
00:24:03,114 --> 00:24:05,135
[SPEAKER_01]: She was in the other line next to me

373
00:24:25,832 --> 00:24:26,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, now, wait a minute, though.

374
00:24:26,954 --> 00:24:32,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Tetris also launched the Game Boy and was the launch title of the most successful system of all time.

375
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:33,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's it.

376
00:24:33,745 --> 00:24:36,269
[SPEAKER_05]: No more Tetris for any next-gen consoles, ever.

377
00:24:37,594 --> 00:24:38,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony, hear me out.

378
00:24:39,015 --> 00:24:39,916
[SPEAKER_05]: No more Tetris.

379
00:24:40,196 --> 00:24:41,297
[SPEAKER_05]: No Tetris on your system.

380
00:24:41,538 --> 00:24:46,762
[SPEAKER_05]: If they come up to you and say, we want to make Tetris for your system, you say, no, I will not have this crap on my system.

381
00:24:46,982 --> 00:24:48,123
[SPEAKER_01]: More Tetris.

382
00:24:48,203 --> 00:24:49,905
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring us Tengen Tetris.

383
00:24:50,005 --> 00:24:53,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, remember the Tetris on the PlayStation?

384
00:24:53,168 --> 00:24:55,170
[SPEAKER_04]: It sucked because they changed the formula.

385
00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:00,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of just being the little blocks, they had the little guy that would climb on the blocks and you weren't supposed to kill him.

386
00:25:00,995 --> 00:25:01,895
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so stupid.

387
00:25:02,436 --> 00:25:03,457
[SPEAKER_01]: That was what, Tetris World?

388
00:25:04,099 --> 00:25:04,741
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember what it was.

389
00:25:04,782 --> 00:25:05,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Tetris suck.

390
00:25:05,524 --> 00:25:06,708
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I call it.

391
00:25:06,849 --> 00:25:08,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Who remembers Blastress?

392
00:25:10,069 --> 00:25:11,450
[SPEAKER_01]: with the Super Scope 6.

393
00:25:12,331 --> 00:25:13,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that one.

394
00:25:13,652 --> 00:25:14,693
[SPEAKER_04]: The Super Scope 6 game.

395
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:15,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I remember that one.

396
00:25:15,613 --> 00:25:17,375
[SPEAKER_01]: I played the hell out of Blastris.

397
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:18,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Who remembers Hatris?

398
00:25:19,336 --> 00:25:20,637
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember Hatris.

399
00:25:20,817 --> 00:25:21,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Wordtris?

400
00:25:21,658 --> 00:25:22,779
[SPEAKER_06]: What about Tetris Sphere?

401
00:25:22,899 --> 00:25:23,999
[SPEAKER_06]: That was awesome.

402
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:26,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Tetris 2, Bomb Bliss?

403
00:25:26,261 --> 00:25:27,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I remember that.

404
00:25:27,662 --> 00:25:30,064
[SPEAKER_06]: They all sucked compared to the original.

405
00:25:30,104 --> 00:25:31,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Tetris Sphere was awesome.

406
00:25:31,805 --> 00:25:34,067
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about cooperative mode on Tengen Tetris.

407
00:25:35,848 --> 00:25:36,709
[SPEAKER_01]: Tengen Tetris.

408
00:25:38,155 --> 00:25:45,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Loki, I find it ironic that you're talking about Tetris on the Sony platform, because didn't you say something to me before the show about Tetris being on the PSP?

409
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,561
[SPEAKER_04]: What's this about?

410
00:25:46,581 --> 00:25:54,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well, the first game, of course, that they're going to port using that stupid Grand Theft Auto hack around, you know, is... No, wait, I don't know.

411
00:25:54,646 --> 00:25:55,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me about the Grand Theft Auto hack.

412
00:25:56,848 --> 00:26:07,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, no, there's this Grand Theft Auto cheat device that was created by this guy named... I believe it's in Carter or something like that.

413
00:26:09,281 --> 00:26:15,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Long story short, it's this wonderful device that you can load all these cheats in, basically like a trainer for Grand Theft Auto.

414
00:26:16,327 --> 00:26:25,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, now they're using this to port Homebrew to the PSP for firmwares 2.5, 2.6, and so on.

415
00:26:26,616 --> 00:26:27,937
[SPEAKER_05]: So, actually, that's what they're doing.

416
00:26:27,977 --> 00:26:33,682
[SPEAKER_05]: The first game that's been released right now is Tetris for version 2.5.

417
00:26:33,742 --> 00:26:33,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Why, people?

418
00:26:35,609 --> 00:26:35,870
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

419
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:43,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

420
00:27:06,309 --> 00:27:13,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, however, one of the things they have done beyond Tetris is they've released a software development kit that they're using for other homebrew over.

421
00:27:13,315 --> 00:27:18,620
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're going to see a lot more stuff coming and possibly another downgrader later on.

422
00:27:20,418 --> 00:27:21,198
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what happens.

423
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:23,619
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's shift gears here a little bit.

424
00:27:23,639 --> 00:27:28,500
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, some folks say that Tetris is a bit of an educational game in some ways because it's a puzzle game.

425
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,041
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to think through it a little bit.

426
00:27:30,321 --> 00:27:31,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, you're making a face.

427
00:27:31,781 --> 00:27:32,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you making a face?

428
00:27:33,641 --> 00:27:35,762
[SPEAKER_01]: Tetris is educational, my butt.

429
00:27:35,842 --> 00:27:37,262
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a thinking game.

430
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,743
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the kind of game that your teachers don't get mad you're playing.

431
00:27:39,763 --> 00:27:41,643
[SPEAKER_01]: Tetris is a game of instinct.

432
00:27:41,843 --> 00:27:42,404
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh-uh.

433
00:27:42,604 --> 00:27:46,625
[SPEAKER_01]: You get up to, like, I would play Tetris from, like, 1 to 18 to 24.

434
00:27:49,148 --> 00:27:50,629
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Mario is the same damn way.

435
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:54,713
[SPEAKER_01]: It's thinking fast in instinct.

436
00:27:54,793 --> 00:27:58,676
[SPEAKER_01]: It's speed thoughts, speed practice.

437
00:27:59,296 --> 00:28:07,443
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was in junior high school, we used to sometimes, because we were such nerds, we would break in our science teacher's classroom and play on the computers.

438
00:28:07,723 --> 00:28:12,647
[SPEAKER_04]: And the only times that we would get our teacher in on it is when we were playing Tetris or Scorched Earth.

439
00:28:14,406 --> 00:28:27,848
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I had, when I was in the writing class I had to take in college, we actually had those old Macs, like the, not the 2Es, but you know what I mean, the old box crap ones.

440
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:36,710
[SPEAKER_01]: And my friend installed Tetris on hers during class, and I was playing Doom in black and white on a Mac.

441
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:38,751
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

442
00:28:38,771 --> 00:28:39,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

443
00:28:39,791 --> 00:28:40,771
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to education.

444
00:28:40,891 --> 00:28:41,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

445
00:28:42,003 --> 00:28:46,048
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a little article up on 1up.com called You Can't Be Serious.

446
00:28:47,009 --> 00:28:50,433
[SPEAKER_01]: Five famous designers rehabilitate the world's most boring games.

447
00:28:50,514 --> 00:28:56,661
[SPEAKER_01]: But I thought, wouldn't it be more interesting since we are actually more celebrity than those losers?

448
00:28:57,903 --> 00:28:58,043
Wow.

449
00:28:59,466 --> 00:29:01,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, I see the hate mail coming in already.

450
00:29:01,267 --> 00:29:02,368
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no, no, I'm joking.

451
00:29:02,388 --> 00:29:03,769
[SPEAKER_04]: I have friends over there, be careful.

452
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:10,213
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some pretty cool people involved in that, like they got some of the folks who worked on Ratchet and Clank and different people.

453
00:29:10,533 --> 00:29:11,894
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think we should do our take on it.

454
00:29:12,461 --> 00:29:13,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, give me an example.

455
00:29:13,762 --> 00:29:15,343
[SPEAKER_01]: First game, Virtual Leader.

456
00:29:16,563 --> 00:29:25,589
[SPEAKER_01]: It works as a staff meeting without donuts, but it teaches managers how to, I like this, I'm going to quote this, how to squash the hopes and dreams of worker bees.

457
00:29:26,069 --> 00:29:28,110
[SPEAKER_01]: But actually you learn how to keep them productive.

458
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:31,132
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the comparison, the Sims meets Office Space.

459
00:29:33,553 --> 00:29:38,276
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the sense that what this article has is it's got famous game designers saying this is an edutainment game there ought to be.

460
00:29:38,396 --> 00:29:39,817
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how we would remake it.

461
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:42,206
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there should be, because you know what?

462
00:29:42,246 --> 00:29:44,588
[SPEAKER_04]: High school isn't just about learning, like book learning.

463
00:29:44,628 --> 00:29:45,929
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about social learning, too.

464
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:51,293
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think there should be a game called Murder the Bully.

465
00:29:51,934 --> 00:29:52,594
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just teasing.

466
00:29:52,614 --> 00:29:53,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't do that, kids.

467
00:29:53,295 --> 00:29:53,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Please don't.

468
00:29:54,275 --> 00:29:56,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it says in here, to rehabilitate.

469
00:29:56,437 --> 00:30:01,821
[SPEAKER_01]: This one, this is by Ted Price, who's the president of Insomniac, who did Wretched and Clank.

470
00:30:03,242 --> 00:30:07,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Said, first of all, the employees in the games would be armed, concealed or visible...

471
00:30:08,188 --> 00:30:13,734
[SPEAKER_01]: and then have full body armor and you can shoot your boss for yelling at you, I think.

472
00:30:13,794 --> 00:30:15,656
[SPEAKER_01]: Each employee should have a unique psychosis.

473
00:30:16,838 --> 00:30:17,739
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be cool.

474
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:25,988
[SPEAKER_01]: But my take on that would be you would have your mole employee who's actually working for another company working on a hostile takeover.

475
00:30:26,548 --> 00:30:27,810
[SPEAKER_01]: And by hostile, I mean bazookas.

476
00:30:29,382 --> 00:30:31,484
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a great game based on an earlier job I had.

477
00:30:31,524 --> 00:30:32,124
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my game.

478
00:30:32,144 --> 00:30:33,085
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my invention of a game.

479
00:30:33,945 --> 00:30:36,587
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Data Entry Monkey, the game.

480
00:30:38,789 --> 00:30:44,133
[SPEAKER_04]: And what you have to do is you have to turn on your... Let's say it's for Xbox because Xboxes have a clock in it.

481
00:30:44,153 --> 00:30:44,453
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that.

482
00:30:44,773 --> 00:30:51,598
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's say that you turn on your Xbox and you have to be in by 8 o'clock or the Xbox yells at you and threatens to fire you, okay?

483
00:30:51,979 --> 00:31:03,808
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what happens is that a sequence of like up, down, left, right, and A, B, Y, X come up on the screen and you have to punch them in with 98% accuracy for 8 freaking hours with 30 minute lunch and two 15 minute breaks.

484
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:06,870
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when it's done, that's it.

485
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:07,391
[SPEAKER_04]: End of game.

486
00:31:07,451 --> 00:31:11,254
[SPEAKER_04]: And it prepares you for your first office job of data entry monkey.

487
00:31:11,857 --> 00:31:16,842
[SPEAKER_01]: There actually is a Yahoo game where you serve customers and take orders and stuff.

488
00:31:16,862 --> 00:31:17,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Root Beer Tapper?

489
00:31:18,183 --> 00:31:20,365
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen, I've watched Iguana Girl playing this.

490
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:22,767
[SPEAKER_01]: She's amazingly good at it.

491
00:31:24,546 --> 00:31:35,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, uh, the next game come up is called A Force More Powerful, which is a pacifist game, it's an anti-war game, where you have military situations come up and you have to find a non-violent solution to them.

492
00:31:36,531 --> 00:31:41,033
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that right away just sounds really boring, because, you know, the whole world just wants to blow the crap out of each other.

493
00:31:41,974 --> 00:31:51,398
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, there's a, they talk in here about having, uh, the, uh, uh, it's by, uh,

494
00:31:52,806 --> 00:31:56,588
[SPEAKER_01]: The manager who oversaw Perfect Dark Zero, which I find this hilarious.

495
00:31:57,248 --> 00:32:01,309
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious what you guys in chat, who are listening to us live, what do you guys think in chat room now?

496
00:32:01,329 --> 00:32:03,610
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to hear some good ideas.

497
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:07,992
[SPEAKER_04]: www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com It's the first show, people.

498
00:32:08,512 --> 00:32:09,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Click on Interact With Us.

499
00:32:10,833 --> 00:32:11,633
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the first show.

500
00:32:11,653 --> 00:32:12,293
[SPEAKER_04]: This is number 170.

501
00:32:12,353 --> 00:32:15,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I keep blaming it on the first show thing.

502
00:32:17,425 --> 00:32:22,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it like doing a country simulator with intelligent AIs that you have to convince them?

503
00:32:22,869 --> 00:32:24,090
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the game's already been done.

504
00:32:25,051 --> 00:32:27,152
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that like ActRaiser or some shit?

505
00:32:28,433 --> 00:32:29,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, I'm not sure.

506
00:32:30,334 --> 00:32:36,559
[SPEAKER_01]: The way I would do that is I would not make a game out of that.

507
00:32:36,699 --> 00:32:38,040
[SPEAKER_01]: I would actually do it in real life.

508
00:32:40,076 --> 00:32:42,578
[SPEAKER_01]: Go outside the game.

509
00:32:43,438 --> 00:32:43,838
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

510
00:32:43,918 --> 00:32:45,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Go outside the game.

511
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:47,661
[SPEAKER_01]: Be active in real life and stop pretending.

512
00:32:48,521 --> 00:32:50,582
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think that would be a very good game at all.

513
00:32:51,103 --> 00:32:52,944
[SPEAKER_04]: We have some feedback in the chat room from Tomo Kun.

514
00:32:52,964 --> 00:32:58,807
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a game at the McDonald's website where you went through a day at work just clicking over and over and producing Big Macs.

515
00:32:59,067 --> 00:33:00,448
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw that a couple years ago.

516
00:33:01,764 --> 00:33:06,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but does the game shoot hot grease at you so you can really get the full experience of what it's like?

517
00:33:06,446 --> 00:33:07,007
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

518
00:33:07,147 --> 00:33:07,947
[SPEAKER_05]: It glamorizes it.

519
00:33:07,967 --> 00:33:14,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it not, you know, penalize you for making really bad burgers or messing up completely?

520
00:33:14,911 --> 00:33:15,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I forgot the patty.

521
00:33:15,891 --> 00:33:16,391
[SPEAKER_05]: That's okay.

522
00:33:17,032 --> 00:33:17,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Close enough.

523
00:33:18,416 --> 00:33:20,057
[SPEAKER_01]: Another game on here is called Virtual You.

524
00:33:21,257 --> 00:33:22,917
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just go ahead and read this.

525
00:33:23,518 --> 00:33:35,541
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, you have to either keep your professors happy and keep the football team off steroids and keep the frat boy issues from happening, like hazing and stuff.

526
00:33:36,282 --> 00:33:39,002
[SPEAKER_01]: So you are being a university administrator.

527
00:33:40,123 --> 00:33:42,123
[SPEAKER_01]: Teaching you the administrative process.

528
00:33:44,424 --> 00:33:46,645
[SPEAKER_01]: If they wanted that to be really realistic, though, the

529
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:55,219
[SPEAKER_01]: Educators would have to be on both some type of coffee and then lots of booze and be highly alcoholic and have an ulcer.

530
00:33:56,941 --> 00:34:01,225
[SPEAKER_01]: They should actually have school administrator health.

531
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:02,449
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

532
00:34:31,417 --> 00:34:33,398
[SPEAKER_04]: You have died of dysentery Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

533
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:02,220
[SPEAKER_04]: A Number Munchers was the one I remember.

534
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember Number Munchers?

535
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,060
[SPEAKER_01]: Mario was missing.

536
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember how people thought that was actually a Mario game?

537
00:35:08,181 --> 00:35:09,141
[SPEAKER_01]: I rented it one time.

538
00:35:09,181 --> 00:35:10,262
[SPEAKER_04]: It had really good music.

539
00:35:10,502 --> 00:35:11,382
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the MP3s.

540
00:35:11,562 --> 00:35:20,164
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what the one good thing about that game was, though, is that it was basically all of the Super Nintendo graphics on a Nintendo from Mario World.

541
00:35:20,764 --> 00:35:21,224
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that.

542
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,785
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looked really good.

543
00:35:22,885 --> 00:35:25,525
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, they put this effort into this game?

544
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:26,306
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me?

545
00:35:26,806 --> 00:35:27,366
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember that.

546
00:35:27,466 --> 00:35:27,906
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember that.

547
00:35:28,775 --> 00:35:29,055
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

548
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:30,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, moving on.

549
00:35:30,316 --> 00:35:31,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, actually, another educational game.

550
00:35:31,917 --> 00:35:32,238
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, what?

551
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:32,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Ridge Racer.

552
00:35:33,979 --> 00:35:34,799
[SPEAKER_04]: How's that educational?

553
00:35:34,819 --> 00:35:35,520
[SPEAKER_01]: It taught me how to drive.

554
00:35:37,722 --> 00:35:38,442
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm serious!

555
00:35:39,503 --> 00:35:45,387
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like how my mom said everything I needed to learn about the birds and the bees, so to speak, I learned from Married With Children.

556
00:35:47,108 --> 00:35:47,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Forget it.

557
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:55,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Jamie, you have a follow-up story here about teachers in the UK supporting games in education.

558
00:35:57,451 --> 00:35:57,791
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

559
00:35:58,532 --> 00:36:03,796
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, there's a project called Teaching with Games.

560
00:36:04,056 --> 00:36:15,085
[SPEAKER_01]: EA and Nesta Future Labs revealed that 60% of UK educators are supporting using video games in education.

561
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:31,594
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a survey that was conducted in November that covered 1,000 primary and secondary school teachers in the UK, and of the 59% who considered using games in education, 53% confirmed they would do so because they are an interactive way of motivating and engaging pupils.

562
00:36:34,096 --> 00:36:39,878
[SPEAKER_01]: 91% believed that playing the games could develop children's motor cognitive skills.

563
00:36:40,279 --> 00:36:46,421
[SPEAKER_01]: Over 60% thought that players would develop their higher order thinking and would also acquire topic-specific knowledge.

564
00:36:46,822 --> 00:36:53,625
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I actually, about two months ago, brought up an article I read in one of the psychology journals that I...

565
00:36:54,245 --> 00:37:13,663
[SPEAKER_01]: occasionally read because I'm a nerd, that was talking about how they actually did full lab study tests with control groups to pit the cognitive function of gamers versus non-gamers and that the gamers came up higher in almost anything having to do with a reactive cognitive type of activity.

566
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:19,228
[SPEAKER_04]: So in other words, when we tell our parents that we're working on our hand-eye coordination, we ain't shitting you.

567
00:37:19,668 --> 00:37:20,369
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually true.

568
00:37:21,732 --> 00:37:29,578
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, because the thing is, especially since there are so many different types of games, you have your puzzle games that basically are teaching you spatial relations right then and there.

569
00:37:29,618 --> 00:37:30,438
[SPEAKER_01]: Tetris, okay?

570
00:37:30,558 --> 00:37:31,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to Tetris.

571
00:37:31,779 --> 00:37:38,043
[SPEAKER_01]: You have your games that are teaching you how to basically come to a conclusion, the logic process.

572
00:37:38,984 --> 00:37:41,186
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you have your games that are teaching you...

573
00:37:42,495 --> 00:37:55,159
[SPEAKER_01]: basically how a sport will go or teaching you how to play a game you understand more of the mechanics behind some of these things especially with as interactive as sports games are becoming you really have to know quite a bit

574
00:37:57,321 --> 00:38:10,026
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's actually really terrific and I wish that instead of our nemesis Mr. Thompson going around saying that games are teaching people how to kill, we're so... What was the word this week?

575
00:38:10,126 --> 00:38:12,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Masturbatory exercise or something?

576
00:38:13,367 --> 00:38:16,388
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying not to be foul-mouthed in this episode.

577
00:38:16,448 --> 00:38:18,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, don't get us that explicit tag on iTunes, please.

578
00:38:18,669 --> 00:38:18,909
[SPEAKER_01]: But...

579
00:38:23,483 --> 00:38:23,803
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

580
00:38:25,164 --> 00:38:27,326
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I take that back because no one would want to.

581
00:38:27,386 --> 00:38:28,007
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd be afraid.

582
00:38:28,167 --> 00:38:29,088
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

583
00:38:29,108 --> 00:38:29,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get us sued.

584
00:38:29,928 --> 00:38:30,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get us sued.

585
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:31,109
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

586
00:38:31,149 --> 00:38:31,730
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.

587
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:32,410
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

588
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:33,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to the good stuff.

589
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:33,912
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to the good stuff.

590
00:38:34,552 --> 00:38:44,541
[SPEAKER_01]: I do, though, think that a lot of these people who naysay games so much are overlooking the amount of good that there is and all that, you know?

591
00:38:45,586 --> 00:38:46,247
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree, I agree.

592
00:38:46,527 --> 00:38:51,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think it's realistic that someday in PE class we could have video games that supplement the games we're about to play?

593
00:38:51,373 --> 00:38:54,176
[SPEAKER_01]: Schools in Southern California have DDR as part of their gym program.

594
00:38:55,117 --> 00:38:59,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think before we go out and play football for real, maybe learn a little bit about the strategy in Madden?

595
00:39:00,103 --> 00:39:00,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Possibly?

596
00:39:00,764 --> 00:39:04,588
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to decide your plays, but that's been there since Tecmo Bowl.

597
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:05,770
[SPEAKER_04]: True.

598
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's change gears here a little bit.

599
00:39:09,012 --> 00:39:10,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting discussion there on education.

600
00:39:10,853 --> 00:39:16,498
[SPEAKER_04]: If you all ever have any feedback, to go at OrangeLaunchRadio.com is the place to send us some emails.

601
00:39:16,518 --> 00:39:18,500
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll get to the mailbag a little bit later in the show.

602
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:22,463
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, we got the Duke from Freeze Pop waiting, so we want to get to him.

603
00:39:22,543 --> 00:39:23,744
[SPEAKER_04]: But we got a couple stories first.

604
00:39:23,804 --> 00:39:28,528
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Loki, what's going on with DirecTV on the Xbox 360?

605
00:39:28,828 --> 00:39:34,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the 360, of course, they wanted to be the entertainment console for you.

606
00:39:34,597 --> 00:39:37,099
[SPEAKER_05]: and basically all encompassing and everything.

607
00:39:37,319 --> 00:39:39,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I think everybody wants in this next gen of game.

608
00:39:40,661 --> 00:39:42,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Want some for $400, seriously.

609
00:39:43,362 --> 00:39:57,051
[SPEAKER_05]: But what they're doing right now, DirecTV has actually announced that they are planning to bring their service to digital televisions via PCs and the Xbox 360 system.

610
00:39:57,791 --> 00:40:03,415
[SPEAKER_05]: This will basically make it a lot easier to turn PCs and DVRs as well as, you know,

611
00:40:04,005 --> 00:40:07,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Making the Xbox 360 awesome.

612
00:40:08,289 --> 00:40:10,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Because now we can record TV to it.

613
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:13,853
[SPEAKER_05]: How this is going to be implemented, I don't know, but sounds cool.

614
00:40:14,314 --> 00:40:14,854
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm all for it.

615
00:40:15,194 --> 00:40:16,115
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting.

616
00:40:16,976 --> 00:40:17,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, why not?

617
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:18,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

618
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:19,798
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you've got a hard drive in there.

619
00:40:19,858 --> 00:40:21,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, it's not big, but, you know.

620
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:28,645
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess anything to reach out to get that Xbox 360 to be the centerpiece in your living room was a good idea for Microsoft, right?

621
00:40:28,665 --> 00:40:32,789
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess, I mean, it's great that they're adding all this extra functionality to it.

622
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:32,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

623
00:40:33,834 --> 00:40:35,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Just when are they going to start making better games?

624
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:56,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Judgment Day is the one with Tommy Tallarico and Victor Lucas, right?

625
00:40:56,575 --> 00:40:59,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing the little, like, you know, I like this game and I don't like this game.

626
00:40:59,778 --> 00:41:06,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the thing is, and I'm not sure, I'm guessing just G4 cancelled it because it's one of the shows... Well, because they don't like gaming anymore.

627
00:41:06,324 --> 00:41:07,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.

628
00:41:07,445 --> 00:41:13,110
[SPEAKER_05]: But one of the things is, basically the show will still kind of exist in this...

629
00:41:14,056 --> 00:41:15,478
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an ongoing show they have.

630
00:41:15,498 --> 00:41:19,341
[SPEAKER_05]: They do three shows, Electric Playground, Reviews on the Run, and then Judgment Day.

631
00:41:19,381 --> 00:41:24,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Judgment Day being gone, but Reviews on the Run is kind of very similar to Judgment Day anyway.

632
00:41:25,087 --> 00:41:27,709
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, it's not really gone.

633
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, Reviews on the Run you're not going to see if you're in the United States.

634
00:41:30,933 --> 00:41:33,495
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't play it in the United States on G4 or anything like that.

635
00:41:34,136 --> 00:41:37,559
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm surprised these guys haven't gotten into the world of video podcasting yet with their stuff.

636
00:41:38,126 --> 00:41:43,788
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if... I mean, they're still doing Electric Playground, so... Take X-Play on, head-to-head.

637
00:41:43,948 --> 00:41:45,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I prefer X-Play personally.

638
00:41:45,848 --> 00:41:49,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Electric Playground's still an okay show, but you know what?

639
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:49,990
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

640
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,310
[SPEAKER_05]: They canceled one show.

641
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:59,533
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so easy to cancel another one, so... You know, I'm sure they'll just replace it with reruns of Thunder in Paradise or something like that.

642
00:42:00,453 --> 00:42:01,453
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be nice.

643
00:42:01,654 --> 00:42:02,494
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be nice.

644
00:42:03,695 --> 00:42:17,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming to G4 TV, Paradise Hotel Because I guarantee you I have some pretty choice things to say about G4 So I'm going to be nice and not say it If you can't say something nice, then shut up There you go Alright, anyway

645
00:42:19,272 --> 00:42:19,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio

646
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:56,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Demanded more Freeze Pop Thanks to a relationship with the gaming group Harmonix Freeze Pop continued to rock us with songs in Amplitude, Karaoke Revolution And now, recently crossed over into mainstream hits Such as Dance Dance Revolution and Guitar Hero Now, Jamie, I know you are the queen of Orange Lounge Radio But what do you think?

647
00:42:56,687 --> 00:42:58,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Should we invite some other royalty here on the show?

648
00:42:59,189 --> 00:43:01,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure Like the Duke from the band Freeze Pop?

649
00:43:01,852 --> 00:43:02,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool

650
00:43:03,484 --> 00:43:07,388
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, please help me welcome to Orange Lounge Radio, The Duke from Freeze Pop.

651
00:43:07,428 --> 00:43:08,049
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?

652
00:43:08,569 --> 00:43:08,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

653
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:10,291
[SPEAKER_04]: How's everybody out there doing?

654
00:43:10,992 --> 00:43:11,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty good.

655
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:15,376
[SPEAKER_04]: We're pretty excited here because we're having our brand new format tonight.

656
00:43:15,396 --> 00:43:16,978
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pretty big week for us.

657
00:43:18,459 --> 00:43:18,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

658
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:22,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I know you've been kind of doing a little bit of touring with Freeze Pop lately.

659
00:43:22,443 --> 00:43:25,326
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys were at the GAME Festival in San Francisco.

660
00:43:25,406 --> 00:43:25,867
[SPEAKER_04]: How'd that go?

661
00:43:27,008 --> 00:43:27,849
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty fun.

662
00:43:28,529 --> 00:43:45,682
[SPEAKER_03]: We were out there just because a game developers conference was happening at that same time and so there's a bunch of video game related events out there and we wanted to play a show and we also played at the Gang Awards which is the Game Audio Network Guild and at the game event at the Metreon.

663
00:43:45,722 --> 00:43:46,423
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a lot of fun.

664
00:43:46,883 --> 00:43:47,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

665
00:43:47,203 --> 00:43:49,645
[SPEAKER_04]: So it sounds like you guys do a lot of video game related events.

666
00:43:49,725 --> 00:43:50,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything coming up?

667
00:43:52,557 --> 00:43:55,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, nothing really tied to that.

668
00:43:55,778 --> 00:44:04,682
[SPEAKER_03]: More just like little one-off shows and weekends here in the U.S., and then we're going back over to England in April for a weekend worth of shows, so that should be fun.

669
00:44:05,002 --> 00:44:09,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if people want to check out your upcoming tour dates, they can always visit your website or your MySpace, right?

670
00:44:10,284 --> 00:44:10,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.

671
00:44:11,084 --> 00:44:18,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Our website is usually the most up-to-date, and that's just freezepop.com, so that's right there on our news page.

672
00:44:18,718 --> 00:44:18,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

673
00:44:19,038 --> 00:44:38,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, you kind of mentioned there that you do a lot of work with these video game award shows and stuff, and of course, I think the way most people know about you guys is that your long-standing working relationship with Harmonix, because seeing a synth band in Guitar Hero was a bit of a surprise, but not to anyone that played Amplitude or Frequency or any of those games.

674
00:44:39,274 --> 00:44:41,475
[SPEAKER_04]: How did your relationship with Harmonix begin?

675
00:44:44,761 --> 00:44:48,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, do you want the real truth or do you want the kind of like fake story?

676
00:44:48,402 --> 00:44:49,843
[SPEAKER_04]: We want the real deal here.

677
00:44:50,763 --> 00:44:52,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the real deal is I work there.

678
00:44:53,144 --> 00:44:53,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, okay.

679
00:44:54,484 --> 00:44:54,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

680
00:44:55,865 --> 00:44:58,506
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's the fake story, just out of curiosity?

681
00:45:00,006 --> 00:45:01,126
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't work there.

682
00:45:02,207 --> 00:45:02,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, okay.

683
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:11,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now, so because you are working at Harmonix, Freeze Pop's not the only name you've done contributions under, right?

684
00:45:12,549 --> 00:45:13,189
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's true.

685
00:45:13,689 --> 00:45:30,273
[SPEAKER_03]: For both frequency and amplitude, I was initially hired there basically just as an audio authoring person, songwriter, and we knew that we weren't going to be able to get enough artists for the game to especially fill out a bunch of sub-genres that we really wanted to have in the game.

686
00:45:31,233 --> 00:45:38,695
[SPEAKER_03]: And so my job was basically to kind of come up with all the different songs that kind of covered the genres we didn't have, like synth-pop, drum and bass,

687
00:45:39,452 --> 00:45:43,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Electro, Techno, Trance, those kind of genres.

688
00:45:43,876 --> 00:45:48,180
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wrote a lot of music under some fake names for those different genres of music.

689
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:52,143
[SPEAKER_04]: But it ended up working out really well because Freeze Pop's kind of taken off, right?

690
00:45:53,424 --> 00:45:56,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Freeze Pop has gotten a lot of fans from video games.

691
00:45:56,907 --> 00:46:02,512
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no denying that we basically reached a whole group of people that probably would never have heard of us.

692
00:46:03,126 --> 00:46:04,047
[SPEAKER_03]: If not through the games.

693
00:46:26,431 --> 00:46:29,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, actually, it was kind of a fun opportunity.

694
00:46:31,096 --> 00:46:45,453
[SPEAKER_03]: I had been trying to get some free spot music into a DDR game for a while, and Harmonix has a long-standing relationship with Konami because we've made the Karaoke Revolution games for them, which there are now four of them out there.

695
00:46:46,778 --> 00:46:53,045
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we actually had one of our, I think Science Genius Girls saw a Freeze Pop song was in the first Karaoke Revolution.

696
00:46:53,105 --> 00:46:53,726
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember that.

697
00:46:53,786 --> 00:46:59,472
[SPEAKER_04]: So how did this relationship with Karaoke Revolution turn into being a part of Ultramix 3?

698
00:47:00,714 --> 00:47:03,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it was basically like any industry.

699
00:47:03,717 --> 00:47:05,419
[SPEAKER_03]: It's based on who you know.

700
00:47:06,636 --> 00:47:33,100
[SPEAKER_03]: The people who kind of like helped the karaoke revolution thing finally got, you know, helped me get in contact with the right people at Tenami and I got some music to them and started talking to them and they were excited about either putting an exclusive Freeze Pop song or a remix or we just, we couldn't figure out like what relationship or like kind of like how we were going to like spin things and so we kind of agreed that they really liked the song Stakeout and I kind of wanted to get them something exclusive that, you know, nobody else had.

701
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:36,353
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

702
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:13,575
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking we'll do something more, I hide behind my magazines

703
00:48:41,863 --> 00:48:42,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

704
00:49:41,496 --> 00:49:46,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, now the video for Stakeout, the Ultra Mix, is kind of very interesting as well.

705
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:48,402
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like a Flash animation video.

706
00:49:48,682 --> 00:49:50,183
[SPEAKER_04]: How did the video come about for that song?

707
00:49:51,204 --> 00:50:03,515
[SPEAKER_03]: That was actually done by our singer, Liz Enthusiasm, whose alter ego is actually as a web designer and animator and kind of like an all-around design guru.

708
00:50:04,275 --> 00:50:09,980
[SPEAKER_03]: And she, a couple years ago, you know, when Flash started to become really popular, just wanted to check it out and

709
00:50:10,492 --> 00:50:21,497
[SPEAKER_03]: I think she felt a good way to kind of get into using the program was to make some videos for us, so she made a video for our song Freeze Pop Forever, and then she also made the Stakeout video for us.

710
00:50:22,177 --> 00:50:25,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome, well the video turned out really well, so pass on our compliments to her, it's great.

711
00:50:26,258 --> 00:50:29,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's pretty fun to have kind of like an animated cartoon

712
00:50:31,003 --> 00:50:35,507
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet it's kind of surreal to see that, but that's great.

713
00:50:36,848 --> 00:50:41,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, is staying in touch with a video game and gamer scene important to you guys as a band?

714
00:50:41,892 --> 00:50:46,456
[SPEAKER_04]: As Freeze Pop continues to get bigger and bigger, are you still going to be contributing to video game projects?

715
00:50:48,177 --> 00:50:49,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I sure hope so.

716
00:50:50,439 --> 00:50:53,401
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to stay as close to that community as possible.

717
00:50:54,222 --> 00:50:57,425
[SPEAKER_03]: The kids are really fun, and it's such a wide group.

718
00:50:57,665 --> 00:50:58,826
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just 14-year-old boys.

719
00:50:58,846 --> 00:50:58,966
[SPEAKER_03]: We get

720
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:08,625
[SPEAKER_03]: People come into our concert, and instead of bringing CDs to sign, they'll bring copies of Amplitude, or maybe they'll bring copies of Guitar Hero now.

721
00:51:09,686 --> 00:51:17,891
[SPEAKER_03]: We played a show in Portland last fall, and this guy brought his PlayStation 2 and had us autograph his PlayStation 2, which was kind of surreal.

722
00:51:18,051 --> 00:51:18,632
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

723
00:51:19,472 --> 00:51:23,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I hope we get to play a lot of shows that kind of appeal to the gaming community.

724
00:51:25,096 --> 00:51:30,099
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a bunch of other bands out there that are also kind of video game related, like 8-Bit Weapon.

725
00:51:30,951 --> 00:51:44,322
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's really fun to play with them and kind of just, you know, our fans who are more of like, got into us musically then find out that they can play some video games and the video game people then find out we have like CDs and play shows and

726
00:51:45,175 --> 00:51:46,796
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely a lot of fun all around.

727
00:51:47,117 --> 00:51:48,398
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be pretty amazing.

728
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:50,339
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be a little bit of a logistical problem.

729
00:51:50,359 --> 00:51:53,141
[SPEAKER_04]: All of us bands are pretty up-and-coming and very DIY.

730
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:13,792
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have labels, we don't have managers, we don't have booking agents, so we kind of do it ourselves.

731
00:52:14,292 --> 00:52:22,478
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sometimes a little bit of a logistical problem to get everybody to all show up in the same cities all at once, but it certainly would be fun.

732
00:52:22,658 --> 00:52:23,919
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true too.

733
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:28,243
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of you guys probably have day jobs like we do here at Orange Launch Radio too.

734
00:52:29,323 --> 00:52:33,306
[SPEAKER_03]: That sometimes gets in the way of being fabulous international rock stars.

735
00:52:33,487 --> 00:52:33,887
Yeah.

736
00:52:34,688 --> 00:52:45,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, now, we've actually heard, because we do a lot of coverage of music-centric video games here on Orange Lounge, we heard of you guys being involved with a new dance game called Neon FM.

737
00:52:45,856 --> 00:52:47,677
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you guys exactly contributing to this project?

738
00:52:48,077 --> 00:52:48,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Just some music, or...?

739
00:52:49,867 --> 00:52:54,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's kind of confusing, and I don't know how much I should comment on it.

740
00:52:54,888 --> 00:53:00,089
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm friends with the two guys, the two Erics, who kind of have set the game up.

741
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:04,110
[SPEAKER_03]: And honestly, I don't even know what the status of the game is right now.

742
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:07,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Neither do we.

743
00:53:08,271 --> 00:53:09,232
[SPEAKER_03]: I said neither do we.

744
00:53:09,272 --> 00:53:10,552
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I thought I'd ask.

745
00:53:11,294 --> 00:53:17,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, every now and then I talk to him, and we actually got a chance to meet them finally.

746
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:22,367
[SPEAKER_03]: They drove up to see a show in Pittsburgh last fall, so we got a chance to hang out with them.

747
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:22,948
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really cool.

748
00:53:23,709 --> 00:53:30,796
[SPEAKER_03]: and I know they've had some ups and downs with the games and it would be really great for the games to come out but honestly I actually don't know a whole lot of information about it.

749
00:53:31,536 --> 00:53:48,432
[SPEAKER_03]: We were slated to put a couple songs in the games and then we pulled one out but we were going to write an exclusive song for the game and I guess we're just kind of waiting to hear if it actually comes out but we would love to contribute songs to it because letting people dance to our music is always like

750
00:53:48,872 --> 00:53:57,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and it would be great to just see a new dance game come out in the arcades, too, something to kind of, you know, bring some energy back to the arcades, because the arcade scene's been lacking.

751
00:53:57,736 --> 00:53:58,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, totally.

752
00:53:59,076 --> 00:54:14,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, I mean, the more people that come out with, like, awesome rhythm action games and dance games and music games, just, you know, it infuses a whole new energy, and you get to see how other game companies approach, you know, dealing with the subject matter, what music they choose, and all that kind of thing, and

753
00:54:15,529 --> 00:54:19,434
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely good to have lots of people kind of got their fingers into the mix and stuff.

754
00:54:19,494 --> 00:54:23,400
[SPEAKER_03]: So it'll be really exciting to see them get that game out there in the arcades.

755
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

756
00:54:24,721 --> 00:54:27,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any other upcoming projects that you can speak about, possibly?

757
00:54:28,946 --> 00:54:32,708
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we're definitely, Harmonix is definitely working on some new game ideas.

758
00:54:33,268 --> 00:54:34,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, I can't really talk about them.

759
00:54:35,609 --> 00:54:48,454
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, of course, we've got some, like, amazing bugs coming off of the Guitar Hero game, and it was, you know, it was really, actually pretty exciting to get a Freeze Pop song on there, considering that we don't actually have any real instruments in our band at all.

760
00:54:50,175 --> 00:54:53,796
[SPEAKER_03]: But, yeah, I mean, we're working on some interesting games, and I think, you know,

761
00:54:54,204 --> 00:54:57,267
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there might be some surprises in the future with what we come up with.

762
00:54:57,827 --> 00:54:58,828
[SPEAKER_04]: You bring up a good point though.

763
00:54:58,868 --> 00:55:04,613
[SPEAKER_04]: How did you manage to get a song in Guitar Hero when you guys don't really use guitars in a lot of your music?

764
00:55:04,653 --> 00:55:08,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you write a song specifically with guitars in mind or how did that work?

765
00:55:09,102 --> 00:55:17,924
[SPEAKER_03]: No, fortunately, we actually had a song that was all about rocking, even though we don't really rock, because we have no drummers or guitar players or anything like that.

766
00:55:18,004 --> 00:55:21,045
[SPEAKER_04]: You can still rock without guitars and drums, I think.

767
00:55:21,085 --> 00:55:35,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and it was the song off our first album, and it was kind of funny, because there's kind of a rip-off of Iron Man at the end of the song, and so when the game kind of got underway, and they were figuring out how to deal with all the unlock songs,

768
00:55:35,965 --> 00:55:40,169
[SPEAKER_03]: and they were really supportive about going to a bunch of local Boston bands.

769
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:50,898
[SPEAKER_03]: A bunch of different Harmonix employees all put songs in the game and so I think the president of Harmonix came by and he was like, you've got to be able to put a song in the game.

770
00:55:51,238 --> 00:55:55,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if you have no guitar in it at all, I think it would be super funny to have you guys in the game.

771
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:57,460
[SPEAKER_03]: And I kind of thought about it.

772
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:01,922
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew which song I wanted to put in, because it had to be a song about, you know, rocking out.

773
00:56:02,882 --> 00:56:10,585
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was kind of debating for a long time whether or not there should be guitar or no guitar, and would it be funnier to play a synthesizer part on the guitar?

774
00:56:11,425 --> 00:56:15,147
[SPEAKER_03]: But ultimately I went with putting a guitar part on there, and I had...

775
00:56:16,327 --> 00:56:34,612
[SPEAKER_03]: A longtime friend, Izzy Maxwell, who has actually done some remixes for Freeze Pop, and he's a really shredding guitar player, and so I kind of said, Izzy, I need you to record a screaming metal guitar part over this, and he kind of just went to town, and I think he created actually a really fun guitar part to play in the game.

776
00:56:35,527 --> 00:56:35,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

777
00:56:35,988 --> 00:56:42,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm kind of wondering, you know, obviously Guitar Hero, lots and lots of people are buying this game.

778
00:56:42,375 --> 00:56:44,797
[SPEAKER_04]: It's doing very well and critically it's doing well.

779
00:56:45,218 --> 00:56:49,903
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a given that there's got to be a sequel in the works, whether you can say anything about it or not.

780
00:56:50,503 --> 00:56:52,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think Freeze Pop will be involved with the sequel as well?

781
00:56:53,852 --> 00:56:57,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man, if there's a sequel, we've got to come up with... The thing is, we don't even have a song we could use.

782
00:56:57,973 --> 00:57:01,814
[SPEAKER_03]: We may have to write a sequel song to get ready to rock.

783
00:57:01,874 --> 00:57:05,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's like, we got ready, but now we're rocking.

784
00:57:05,194 --> 00:57:07,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Or something like that.

785
00:57:08,535 --> 00:57:17,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Not sure what's going to happen, but man, it's always exciting to see if the game is appropriate for putting one of our songs on there, even if it's kind of a stretch.

786
00:57:18,595 --> 00:57:30,585
[SPEAKER_03]: There were some reviews for Guitar Hero with people who were really surprised that we got a song on there and kind of almost gave the game extra kudos for kind of going out on a limb and putting almost an inappropriate song into a guitar game.

787
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:44,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, it worked out beautifully, and I think it pleases the fans, the longtime fans of Freeze Pop via Harmonix, and I think the folks who were playing Guitar Hero and had never heard of you guys probably had a chance to rock out to the song as well.

788
00:57:44,476 --> 00:57:46,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, we're already starting...

789
00:57:46,517 --> 00:57:53,188
[SPEAKER_03]: We're already starting to get some emails from some fans who are like, I never heard of you guys and I saw you in the game.

790
00:57:53,248 --> 00:58:00,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you go to your website and they figure out who you are and they decide whether or not you think you're a complete idiot or they like your music.

791
00:58:01,881 --> 00:58:05,402
[SPEAKER_03]: and we get our little share of hate mail, which is kind of interesting.

792
00:58:05,462 --> 00:58:06,082
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of fun.

793
00:58:07,222 --> 00:58:14,644
[SPEAKER_03]: It's exciting to know that you've impacted somebody, whether or not you totally rocked their world or you made them completely hate you.

794
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:16,665
[SPEAKER_03]: At least you made an impression on them.

795
00:58:16,965 --> 00:58:17,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

796
00:58:17,365 --> 00:58:20,126
[SPEAKER_04]: We get the hate mail, too, here at Orange Lounge once in a while.

797
00:58:20,266 --> 00:58:27,508
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of interesting to think that, wow, what you did motivated somebody to sit down and actually write out, Dear Orange Lounger, I hate you.

798
00:58:30,021 --> 00:58:31,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, well at least he bought the CD.

799
00:58:58,668 --> 00:58:59,509
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I said.

800
00:58:59,589 --> 00:59:01,050
[SPEAKER_03]: At least he bought a CD.

801
00:59:01,110 --> 00:59:04,733
[SPEAKER_03]: I was excited because he created a piece of art himself.

802
00:59:05,613 --> 00:59:14,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Every now and then when we get a new piece of anti-freeze pop email, I forward them that email and ask them to maybe try a little bit harder next time.

803
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:20,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, that doesn't make them super happy either, but you know what can you do.

804
00:59:20,985 --> 00:59:23,267
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to ask all of our guests on the show this question.

805
00:59:23,547 --> 00:59:27,610
[SPEAKER_04]: What are some of your favorite games to play outside of these music games we've been talking about earlier?

806
00:59:29,028 --> 00:59:32,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm definitely an old-school person.

807
00:59:32,490 --> 00:59:36,953
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, old 8-bit Atari 2600 games are still, like, my favorite.

808
00:59:37,973 --> 00:59:45,037
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the thing about games where you have to invest incredible amounts of time to beat the game is a little bit frustrating to me.

809
00:59:46,058 --> 00:59:53,102
[SPEAKER_03]: My interaction with games is definitely more of kind of a transitional, short-time experience, and so I just like to sit down...

810
00:59:53,632 --> 01:00:01,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Play a couple of levels of something and don't feel bad when I want to, like, you know, not sit there for, like, ten hours or have to come back to it day after day.

811
01:00:01,836 --> 01:00:08,059
[SPEAKER_03]: So definitely, you know, I'm big fans of, like, Yars' Revenge and Sub Hunt and kind of old 8-bit games.

812
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:12,842
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, you know, like, newer games, I play a lot of them just to kind of see what people do.

813
01:00:13,702 --> 01:00:20,586
[SPEAKER_03]: I worked for a race car driving video game company for a while, so I really got into, like, NASCAR games and race car games and stuff.

814
01:00:20,626 --> 01:00:20,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

815
01:00:21,974 --> 01:00:27,659
[SPEAKER_03]: which is pretty random, but I like to check those out, and we just got a 360 at Harmonix.

816
01:00:27,679 --> 01:00:31,143
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been checking out the new racing games and stuff like that.

817
01:00:32,124 --> 01:00:33,365
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.

818
01:00:35,026 --> 01:00:37,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, I'm a huge fan of the games inside the genre.

819
01:00:37,809 --> 01:00:42,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Rez was a huge game for me, and Vibribin, and...

820
01:00:47,621 --> 01:00:51,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that's great you've named Vib Ribbon because that game didn't even come out in this country.

821
01:00:51,343 --> 01:00:52,384
[SPEAKER_04]: And we know that game.

822
01:00:52,404 --> 01:00:53,184
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an awesome game.

823
01:00:54,085 --> 01:00:56,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we have some Japanese PS2s.

824
01:00:57,026 --> 01:00:59,508
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're big fans of a lot of the Japanese games.

825
01:01:00,389 --> 01:01:05,572
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the guy who came up with Vib Ribbon and, you know, Unjammer Lammy.

826
01:01:05,692 --> 01:01:07,793
[SPEAKER_03]: And those games are really super fun to play.

827
01:01:08,934 --> 01:01:10,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Guitaroman is kind of interesting.

828
01:01:10,675 --> 01:01:11,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely check that out.

829
01:01:11,916 --> 01:01:13,557
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a difficult game, that's for certain.

830
01:01:15,036 --> 01:01:36,191
[SPEAKER_04]: and you know I'm a big fan of Katamari Damacy like I just those games that are kind of quirky and left of center are some of my favorite ones it sounds like we have a lot of the same tastes in games those are games we're always talking about on here so that's that's awesome cool all right so that's about all I wanted to ask you game wise but I want to give you a chance to plug any any albums or tour dates you got coming up that you want to tell our listeners about here's your chance

831
01:01:37,321 --> 01:01:37,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's see.

832
01:01:38,003 --> 01:01:39,366
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, things are kind of quiet.

833
01:01:39,406 --> 01:01:44,058
[SPEAKER_03]: We're working on a new Freeze Pop album, and it's well underway.

834
01:01:44,398 --> 01:01:46,223
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know when it's going to be done, but definitely...

835
01:01:47,486 --> 01:02:15,828
[SPEAKER_03]: pay attention to our website and we're playing a bunch of shows in March and April we're going to be in Ohio and Indiana and I think we're going to go up to Chicago in March and then we'll be over in England to play in London and Leeds and a couple cities over there at the end of April and definitely just pay attention to our website because we'll probably be out on the west coast as well maybe like in the fall and hopefully we'll have a new album so there you go

836
01:02:16,648 --> 01:02:22,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome, alright, so Freezepop.com to stay in tune with all the latest information, what's going on with Freezepop?

837
01:02:23,472 --> 01:02:26,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're on MySpace too, so come and be our friend there as well.

838
01:02:27,014 --> 01:02:33,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, awesome, so Kasson, aka The Duke from Freezepop, thank you so much for being on Orange Lounge Radio and spending time with us this week.

839
01:02:34,279 --> 01:02:35,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's super fun, thanks for having me.

840
01:02:35,779 --> 01:02:36,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, no problem.

841
01:02:37,701 --> 01:02:41,963
[SPEAKER_01]: That was very, very cool, especially the Vibribin mention, because I'm like, Vibribin!

842
01:02:43,644 --> 01:02:45,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that guy know how to rock, or what?

843
01:02:45,666 --> 01:02:47,868
[SPEAKER_01]: Freeze Pop is now my second favorite band.

844
01:02:48,589 --> 01:02:49,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Next to Gorillaz?

845
01:02:49,429 --> 01:02:50,150
[SPEAKER_01]: Next to Gorillaz.

846
01:02:50,450 --> 01:02:52,912
[SPEAKER_01]: They even have surpassed Pain.

847
01:02:53,273 --> 01:02:54,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we all know Pain is good.

848
01:02:55,414 --> 01:02:55,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Freeze Pop, yay.

849
01:02:57,256 --> 01:03:00,158
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally blanked and forgot to ask about Supernova.

850
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:01,900
[SPEAKER_04]: And the chat room hates me for it, I know.

851
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,983
[SPEAKER_04]: But I totally didn't even think to ask about Supernova.

852
01:03:05,343 --> 01:03:07,505
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll talk about Supernova in the next hour.

853
01:03:08,185 --> 01:03:11,188
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm glad he has a lot of...

854
01:03:12,238 --> 01:03:17,001
[SPEAKER_05]: I still don't like their music.

855
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:19,982
[SPEAKER_05]: You can just die.

856
01:03:20,082 --> 01:03:20,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

857
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:23,764
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't like them.

858
01:03:24,285 --> 01:03:27,266
[SPEAKER_05]: They're probably a really cool band, but nothing I've heard so far.

859
01:03:27,286 --> 01:03:29,927
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like that type of music.

860
01:03:30,028 --> 01:03:30,428
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

861
01:03:30,528 --> 01:03:32,149
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

862
01:03:32,729 --> 01:03:33,269
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't.

863
01:03:33,649 --> 01:03:36,271
[SPEAKER_01]: I like Freeze Pop's music the same way I like 8-Bit Weapon.

864
01:03:37,812 --> 01:03:38,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the whole...

865
01:03:40,030 --> 01:03:43,451
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the whole little quirky synthy vibe, and they remind me of Berlin.

866
01:03:43,571 --> 01:03:45,792
[SPEAKER_04]: He mentioned 8-Bit Weapon, so I think they're kind of buddy bands.

867
01:03:46,212 --> 01:03:48,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I really dig 8-Bit Weapon.

868
01:03:48,333 --> 01:03:49,813
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what else I thought was interesting about that?

869
01:03:50,193 --> 01:03:52,994
[SPEAKER_04]: He said that they have an Xbox 360 at Harmonix.

870
01:03:53,114 --> 01:03:53,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

871
01:03:54,715 --> 01:03:55,175
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder why.

872
01:03:55,981 --> 01:03:59,083
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

873
01:04:25,499 --> 01:04:27,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Elite on the BBC Micro

874
01:04:54,138 --> 01:04:55,679
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know what the hell that is, but that's alright.

875
01:04:55,860 --> 01:04:56,741
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never played it.

876
01:04:56,841 --> 01:04:57,541
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard of it, though.

877
01:04:57,581 --> 01:04:58,382
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the game.

878
01:04:58,722 --> 01:04:59,503
[SPEAKER_04]: I've just not played it.

879
01:04:59,523 --> 01:05:00,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it a game system you don't have?

880
01:05:02,406 --> 01:05:04,648
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not have a BBC Micro, and I need to have one.

881
01:05:04,808 --> 01:05:05,609
[SPEAKER_04]: It wouldn't work on our TV.

882
01:05:05,629 --> 01:05:07,030
[SPEAKER_04]: You should have to get the little adapter thing.

883
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:08,592
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I actually have a system.

884
01:05:08,692 --> 01:05:11,054
[SPEAKER_01]: I now have a system so old I cannot play it on my TV.

885
01:05:11,375 --> 01:05:11,695
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

886
01:05:11,795 --> 01:05:12,255
[SPEAKER_01]: An Odyssey 2.

887
01:05:13,156 --> 01:05:13,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

888
01:05:13,737 --> 01:05:14,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, those things are old.

889
01:05:14,738 --> 01:05:15,719
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, my TV's like...

890
01:05:18,582 --> 01:05:20,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do we have to do these lists all the time?

891
01:05:20,543 --> 01:05:22,084
[SPEAKER_04]: What motivates people to make lists?

892
01:05:22,404 --> 01:05:23,305
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's hilarious.

893
01:05:23,545 --> 01:05:24,866
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so we can talk about this.

894
01:05:24,886 --> 01:05:25,666
[SPEAKER_01]: We can fill show time.

895
01:05:25,686 --> 01:05:26,187
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, number nine.

896
01:05:26,447 --> 01:05:32,150
[SPEAKER_01]: My number one cause of motion sickness, Goldeneye 007 on the Nintendo 64.

897
01:05:33,251 --> 01:05:36,192
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the one game that made me puke, literally.

898
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:39,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Not because it was a bad game, because it gave me vertigo.

899
01:05:40,355 --> 01:05:47,459
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was a really awesome game, and I don't think there has been as good of a bond game since.

900
01:05:48,562 --> 01:05:49,483
[SPEAKER_01]: Goldeneye was excellent.

901
01:05:50,964 --> 01:05:52,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Number 8, Street Fighter 2.

902
01:05:53,566 --> 01:05:54,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming soon to Xbox Arcade.

903
01:05:55,927 --> 01:05:58,629
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this was the one that brought you the World Warriors.

904
01:05:58,669 --> 01:06:02,071
[SPEAKER_01]: This set the stage for 2D fighting.

905
01:06:02,352 --> 01:06:03,973
[SPEAKER_01]: For even a lot of 3D fighters.

906
01:06:05,053 --> 01:06:08,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, we actually even have the Street Fighter EX series.

907
01:06:09,496 --> 01:06:12,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, coming up for number 7, Super Mario Kart.

908
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:14,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Good choice.

909
01:06:16,421 --> 01:06:17,402
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and it really...

910
01:06:18,886 --> 01:06:19,847
[SPEAKER_01]: I do agree with this.

911
01:06:19,907 --> 01:06:24,512
[SPEAKER_01]: It says it seemed like the worst idea ever but quickly proved itself as the best thing ever.

912
01:06:26,134 --> 01:06:29,558
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my college dorm life was Mario Kart like every weekend.

913
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:35,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you were in my room, it was Mario Kart because we were the nerd room.

914
01:06:35,284 --> 01:06:38,027
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you're in the room down the hall, it was smoke weed and drink.

915
01:06:38,768 --> 01:06:39,529
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what mine was?

916
01:06:39,689 --> 01:06:39,849
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

917
01:06:40,672 --> 01:06:41,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Monkey Island 2, LeChuck's Revenge

918
01:07:10,227 --> 01:07:12,969
[SPEAKER_01]: and, let's see, that was number six.

919
01:07:13,189 --> 01:07:16,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Number five, Legend of Zelda, Ocarina of Time.

920
01:07:17,571 --> 01:07:17,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

921
01:07:18,971 --> 01:07:23,974
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still partial to the Super Nintendo one, but I won't get into that discussion tonight because we're running long.

922
01:07:24,154 --> 01:07:27,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Because people don't like it when I say that Ocarina of Time is way overrated.

923
01:07:27,916 --> 01:07:28,276
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway.

924
01:07:29,196 --> 01:07:30,377
[SPEAKER_01]: Lies.

925
01:07:30,597 --> 01:07:31,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Lies.

926
01:07:31,898 --> 01:07:32,898
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, he lives.

927
01:07:33,098 --> 01:07:33,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hi, hi.

928
01:07:34,619 --> 01:07:36,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Glad you could pull yourself a Mario Kart for a minute.

929
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:36,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk to us.

930
01:07:37,771 --> 01:07:38,671
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I do apologize.

931
01:07:38,691 --> 01:07:39,792
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that was number five.

932
01:07:39,812 --> 01:07:41,712
[SPEAKER_01]: Number four, Pro Evolution Soccer 4.

933
01:07:43,753 --> 01:07:44,773
[SPEAKER_01]: We are talking about the UK.

934
01:07:45,274 --> 01:07:45,494
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

935
01:07:46,134 --> 01:07:47,034
[SPEAKER_06]: The real football.

936
01:07:47,054 --> 01:07:47,374
[SPEAKER_01]: Men in shorts.

937
01:07:47,454 --> 01:07:48,655
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a really good series, actually.

938
01:07:49,335 --> 01:07:49,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

939
01:07:49,775 --> 01:07:50,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

940
01:07:50,215 --> 01:07:50,895
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really fun.

941
01:07:52,196 --> 01:07:53,956
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually kind of want to play it.

942
01:07:54,057 --> 01:07:54,757
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, it's Konami.

943
01:07:55,057 --> 01:07:55,557
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice plug there.

944
01:07:57,298 --> 01:08:01,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Next up, number three, Pokemon Red slash Green, whichever one of those.

945
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:04,280
[SPEAKER_01]: I still like the Pikachu one best, but still.

946
01:08:05,152 --> 01:08:07,033
[SPEAKER_01]: I will forget that five seconds from now

947
01:08:29,401 --> 01:08:30,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario Kart DS Mario Kart on Super Nintendo

948
01:08:57,709 --> 01:08:59,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Mario Bros.

949
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:00,730
[SPEAKER_04]: 3, and Super Mario World.

950
01:09:01,891 --> 01:09:02,451
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's just me.

951
01:09:02,691 --> 01:09:03,112
[SPEAKER_04]: What do I know?

952
01:09:03,312 --> 01:09:06,133
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just some schmo that you downloaded onto your iPod.

953
01:09:06,193 --> 01:09:10,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one game ever, guaranteed to piss some people off.

954
01:09:10,635 --> 01:09:11,155
[SPEAKER_01]: Namely, Loki.

955
01:09:11,955 --> 01:09:12,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Tetris!

956
01:09:14,176 --> 01:09:17,638
[SPEAKER_01]: Even better, specifically, Game Boy Tetris.

957
01:09:19,087 --> 01:09:19,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Samba de Amigo Beatmania DDR

958
01:09:44,029 --> 01:09:45,950
[SPEAKER_01]: 65, and this makes me happy, Tempest 2000.

959
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:46,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

960
01:09:47,031 --> 01:09:47,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Heck, yeah.

961
01:09:47,972 --> 01:09:48,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's too low.

962
01:09:49,092 --> 01:09:49,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Too low.

963
01:09:49,613 --> 01:09:49,913
[SPEAKER_01]: Too low.

964
01:09:49,933 --> 01:09:50,953
[SPEAKER_01]: That needs to be, like, number three.

965
01:09:51,214 --> 01:09:51,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

966
01:09:52,014 --> 01:09:53,175
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of Mario 64.

967
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:57,998
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is probably my single favorite shooting game of all time, even though I suck at it.

968
01:09:58,678 --> 01:09:59,038
[SPEAKER_01]: R-Type.

969
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:08,104
[SPEAKER_01]: That game makes me want to do that Linkin Park song, you know, went so long and got so far, but in the end it didn't matter.

970
01:10:08,384 --> 01:10:10,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you can't beat that game unless you're like God.

971
01:10:11,326 --> 01:10:13,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Shall I do three shooting games I enjoy more than R-Type?

972
01:10:14,528 --> 01:10:14,728
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

973
01:10:15,528 --> 01:10:17,909
[SPEAKER_01]: And number 99 was Pong.

974
01:10:19,209 --> 01:10:20,790
[SPEAKER_01]: Number 100 was Hard Drivin'.

975
01:10:21,710 --> 01:10:26,211
[SPEAKER_04]: You know I'm surprised Pac-Man wasn't in the top 10 because every top list always has Pac-Man somewhere on it.

976
01:10:26,531 --> 01:10:27,612
[SPEAKER_04]: And rightfully so.

977
01:10:27,632 --> 01:10:29,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Pac-Man does have a severe tarnish on its name.

978
01:10:30,412 --> 01:10:31,693
[SPEAKER_01]: The Atari 2600 version.

979
01:10:33,013 --> 01:10:36,734
[SPEAKER_01]: But Hard Drivin', I had to mention it because it has significance for me.

980
01:10:37,234 --> 01:10:39,615
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to work at an Amco arcade when I lived in Alabama.

981
01:10:40,505 --> 01:10:43,469
[SPEAKER_01]: and you had that swivel out chair and when you sit inside it's really dark.

982
01:10:43,789 --> 01:10:46,552
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to take naps at work in the hard drive and machine.

983
01:10:47,913 --> 01:10:49,375
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and this kind of leads into the next story.

984
01:10:49,395 --> 01:10:51,337
[SPEAKER_04]: I was watching a documentary on PBS.

985
01:10:51,457 --> 01:10:53,259
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you guys have seen this, but there's a documentary.

986
01:10:53,299 --> 01:10:55,221
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Miklatov saw part of this with me yesterday.

987
01:10:55,442 --> 01:10:56,303
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so boring.

988
01:10:56,343 --> 01:10:57,304
[SPEAKER_04]: It's two hours long.

989
01:10:57,364 --> 01:11:00,167
[SPEAKER_04]: I only could watch the first hour because it's like,

990
01:11:00,956 --> 01:11:02,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

991
01:11:15,449 --> 01:11:15,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Old people?

992
01:11:16,090 --> 01:11:16,910
