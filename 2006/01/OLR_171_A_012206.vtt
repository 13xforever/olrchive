Tonight, January 22nd, 2006, is because Mondo and Mondo Trouble, a new Silent Hill trailer

00:20.080 --> 00:24.160
hits the net and has everyone buzzing, and we talk about the worst reviewed video games

00:24.160 --> 00:31.160
of all time.

00:32.240 --> 00:38.360
Welcome everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. This is episode number 171. For this,

00:38.360 --> 00:43.840
January the 22nd, 2006, we're here to talk about video games and what gamers really

00:43.840 --> 00:45.440
want to know about, and of course,

00:45.440 --> 00:48.480
you know, our old catchphrase, the video games

00:48.480 --> 00:51.800
that don't suck, but sometimes we have to tell you about the ones that do suck,

00:51.800 --> 00:53.440
just to tell you to stay away from them.

00:53.440 --> 01:01.060
My name is Rob Roberts you might know me as sky joining me as always are my lovely co-hosts. Say hello to dark Sakura Jamie Summers. Oh

01:02.020 --> 01:07.600
Your mics your mics off dear. No, it isn't. There we go. I can't find the ferret. Oh, there he is

01:07.600 --> 01:11.820
I've decided the name of the ferret our our mascot ferret which we've had for the past

01:11.820 --> 01:18.440
What three and a half years now that we've had a live show. What are we calling the ferret Senor Brito? Why Senor burrito?

01:18.440 --> 01:22.440
Because? Is that a chatroom influence thing?

01:22.440 --> 01:25.440
No, his name is Señor Burrito. Sounds like it. Okay.

01:25.440 --> 01:30.440
Hey, don't mean to step on Señor Burrito over there.

01:30.440 --> 01:34.440
Say hello to Señor Taco over there in the corner. Loki!

01:34.440 --> 01:38.440
I'm not Señor Taco. I do not like tacos.

01:38.440 --> 01:41.440
How are you? Sorry, Señor McDonald's.

01:41.440 --> 01:46.440
I don't know what this is. It's not food, that's for sure.

01:46.440 --> 01:51.200
That's why I don't feel bad eating it see I I can't get fat off of it because it's not actually food

01:51.200 --> 01:55.480
It's like toxic waste in buns. Oh, yeah, and that won't make your ass big. That's that's for sure

01:56.160 --> 01:59.920
All right. Well, we're here to have a wedding to prepare for I am

02:00.480 --> 02:02.480
game over

02:03.760 --> 02:06.840

02:07.040 --> 02:10.640

02:33.240 --> 02:38.240
But first let's get to the games and talk about how our gaming weeks were

02:38.240 --> 02:40.240
Because that's how we start things off here. Dark Sakura

02:40.240 --> 02:41.240
Dark Sakura.

02:41.240 --> 02:45.960
Mine was special, as in not very.

02:45.960 --> 02:53.740
I actually went, made it to school this week, because I actually sort of started school,

02:53.740 --> 02:58.320
and someone was in there playing puppies.

02:58.320 --> 03:01.160
Playing that puppy game, Nintendogs.

03:01.160 --> 03:03.000
Oh, people are still playing Nintendogs?

03:03.000 --> 03:06.680
Yeah, and I was like, I quit playing that game, because I got kind of bored, and she's

03:06.680 --> 03:09.160
like, BLASPHEMY!

03:09.160 --> 03:13.480
this the one friend of yours that was at your bachelorette party that I just met

03:13.480 --> 03:18.640
her okay nevermind apparently though she's someone who knows um rice princess

03:18.640 --> 03:24.220
okay and small has been through the show Oh apparently knows of the show small

03:24.220 --> 03:28.600
world so yeah what whatever happened to your friend that was like hardcore and

03:28.600 --> 03:31.960
intend dogs that I I met at your bachelorette party and she had like the

03:31.960 --> 03:36.920
Dalmatian and everything Oh Melchon yes um she's I think she's still playing

03:36.920 --> 03:41.420
with her puppies but she's she's a Dan's assistant manager. That game just got old

03:41.420 --> 03:46.460
I'm sorry to say. She's playing with the villages too with her village people. Are

03:46.460 --> 03:50.300
they all doing the YMCA? No mine are doing the migrate out of Dark Sakura's

03:50.300 --> 03:54.620
town right now. Mine are doing the let's go pick weeds. I'm actually I'm actually

03:54.620 --> 03:58.880
harassing Lindbergh right now for all of his Japanese stuff in his house because

03:58.880 --> 04:02.900
I'm remaking the shrine to fire. You know the best way to get people to move out

04:02.900 --> 04:07.820
your town on Animal Crossing leave a lot don't talk to them ever and then they

04:07.820 --> 04:12.820
leave because they feel ignored good is it is this sad that that we're talking

04:12.820 --> 04:19.700
about a fake town on a fake video game no and yet the people like have these

04:19.700 --> 04:27.260
real social interactions okay forget it anything else to share um no Loki yes

04:27.260 --> 04:32.780
your gaming week you played anything yes um I did play um I actually got to play

04:32.780 --> 04:39.020
a little bit more of my 360. I was playing Ridge Racer this morning and I love that game.

04:39.020 --> 04:42.780
It plays exactly like every other Ridge Racer game. Probably because they haven't really

04:42.780 --> 04:47.900
changed much in it. But it looks good and I got through quite a bit. Had to find the

04:47.900 --> 04:51.640
right car, you know, because each car kind of handles a little bit differently. Then

04:51.640 --> 05:00.500
I finally found my right car for it and now I'm kicking ass. And I do like the fact they've

05:00.500 --> 05:04.460
had actually more downloads for it now, so there's more cars, and I purchased some of

05:04.460 --> 05:08.380
the music that I liked from the other games, because you can download that as well, because

05:08.380 --> 05:14.580
it costs money, boo, but I did that anyways, and I also played a little bit of Final Fantasy

05:14.580 --> 05:19.340
11 for the 360 because they have the beta now that you can get with the official Xbox

05:19.340 --> 05:20.340
magazine.

05:20.340 --> 05:25.180
I was listening to other podcasts where folks were getting the Final Fantasy 11, it was

05:25.180 --> 05:27.220
taking them like three hours to install it.

05:27.220 --> 05:28.220
Oh yeah, yeah.

05:28.220 --> 05:32.020
memories of the PC version hey guess guess what guys here's something you may

05:32.020 --> 05:34.500
not know for those of you that are getting on the 360 for the first time

05:34.500 --> 05:38.700
that weren't doing the PC expect those three hour patches like once every two

05:38.700 --> 05:42.220
months because they'll change something big in the game and then everybody tries

05:42.220 --> 05:46.500
to patch at the same time I have to say you know I don't want to start a whole

05:46.500 --> 05:50.540
like MMO debate but World of Warcraft has their patching down like the way

05:50.540 --> 05:54.380
they do it because they use peer-to-peer to do it it's it's smooth I've never had

05:54.380 --> 05:59.220
a patching problem on World of Warcraft, but Final Fantasy XI? Ugh. Nightmares. Nightmares.

05:59.220 --> 06:02.940
Well, okay, well playing, the only thing that I would say that's pretty good about this

06:02.940 --> 06:09.020
is that the actual, like, screens and the play online stuff's really quick. That's really

06:09.020 --> 06:14.940
quick. But that's about it. And then the rest of the game is exactly the same. In fact,

06:14.940 --> 06:20.440
I play my 360 on a PC. So I was like, okay PC monitor, this should be a pretty good representation

06:20.440 --> 06:25.700
of the difference between my PC version and this version. There is no difference other

06:25.700 --> 06:31.440
than the fact that this one's in letterbox on my PC screen and the other one is not.

06:31.440 --> 06:36.560
Also, by the way, if you don't happen to have a letterbox TV or you're playing on a monitor,

06:36.560 --> 06:39.000
everything is going to be stretched.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.240
Oh my gosh, they're going to letterbox it for regular TVs?

06:42.240 --> 06:43.760
Yes, it's going to be letterboxed.

06:43.760 --> 06:48.480
That chat dialogue is going to be horrible trying to read that stuff on a regular TV.

06:48.480 --> 06:53.120
and you have to have to buy a USB keyboard in order to play this thing

06:53.120 --> 06:57.080
it's impossible near or near possible play without it I mean but that's the

06:57.080 --> 06:57.540
same

06:57.540 --> 07:00.920
story with the PlayStation 2. Does any old USB keyboard work?

07:00.920 --> 07:04.440
Yeah, pretty much. That's not gonna be a problem for most people. That's not a big problem but

07:04.440 --> 07:08.080
the only thing I tried playing a little bit this morning

07:08.080 --> 07:11.720
I can't really level up at all because there's a ton of new people starting

07:11.720 --> 07:13.080
remember this is like a totally

07:13.080 --> 07:16.960
brand new server that they're testing it on right now so everybody's like level one

07:16.960 --> 07:21.760
it's like imagine all the rabbits in the very beginning the game

07:21.760 --> 07:25.280
camp the hell I mean there's like no way to get

07:25.280 --> 07:28.700
anything it kinda sucks and that

07:28.700 --> 07:33.040
thats so it's a brand new game for every region right because

07:33.040 --> 07:36.200
when when Final Fantasy 11 launched in the US we were hooked up

07:36.200 --> 07:40.640
automatically with the Japanese servers well so this is just a beta test server

07:40.640 --> 07:41.200
right now

07:41.200 --> 07:46.560
so you know and I when I first played Final Fantasy 11 I bought Final Fantasy 11 on launch day

07:46.560 --> 07:51.000
for the PC when it first came out like years ago and I don't remember that

07:51.000 --> 07:53.560
being a problem of course at the same time I didn't know what the hell I was

07:53.560 --> 07:56.120
doing in that game because that game just kind of throws you into it it

07:56.120 --> 08:00.000
doesn't have a very excellent tutorial with it so you just kind of have to jump

08:00.000 --> 08:03.800
in and get going and so I didn't even know to kill rabbits for like a couple

08:03.800 --> 08:07.640
days you remember how long I was going through WTF mode in that game oh yeah I

08:07.640 --> 08:14.080
was like I miss I miss I miss Ragnarok already yeah so it doesn't really

08:14.080 --> 08:18.560
improve on anything, and I thought that at least you would have something improve like

08:18.560 --> 08:24.280
the textures or something. It doesn't look any better than my PC version. It's like,

08:24.280 --> 08:31.120
why the fuck would I go out there and pay $60 for this game? For a 360? There's no point,

08:31.120 --> 08:35.600
really. If you have it for your PC, don't spend the extra money. Oh, Big Whoopie, it

08:35.600 --> 08:42.040
has the expansion on there and you get some achievements unlocked. Who cares? It's $60.

08:42.040 --> 08:46.520
it's not worth your money.

08:46.520 --> 08:51.120
I think for the most part, people that own these next-gen systems probably have a PC

08:51.120 --> 08:52.120
at home.

08:52.120 --> 08:54.880
That's a pretty fair assumption.

08:54.880 --> 08:59.080
If you're interested in an MMO like this, I'm sure that you've probably tried it out.

08:59.080 --> 09:02.680
The other thing that also kind of sucks is that it's not really tied in with Xbox Live

09:02.680 --> 09:03.680
too well.

09:03.680 --> 09:08.660
You have to actually launch the Play Online viewer and all that stuff, and that's lame.

09:08.660 --> 09:11.480
You're going to have to have Xbox Live and Play Online to play it, so you're going to

09:11.480 --> 09:17.600
be paying two fees. Not necessarily. You only need silver to play this. So you only have

09:17.600 --> 09:23.320
to really pay one fee. But I'm already paying for Xbox Live gold. What the hell do I need

09:23.320 --> 09:28.880
to be paying another fee for? So I'm honestly, I'm not picking this up when this comes out.

09:28.880 --> 09:33.880
I really don't care. In the expansion it's not going to be a big deal. And what they've

09:33.880 --> 09:39.140
done with it so far, no I thought this was supposed to be the big huge thing. Ooh look

09:39.140 --> 09:42.740
it's an mmo coming to the xbox who it's going to be amazing

09:42.740 --> 09:45.620
i'm not amazed at all i'm not even impressed

09:45.620 --> 09:46.760
a little bit

09:46.760 --> 09:51.660
it looks just like a pc game i mean the pc version and has not proved in any way

09:51.660 --> 09:52.700
whatsoever

09:52.700 --> 09:56.780
now do you think someone like me or someone like jamie who has a wide screen

09:56.780 --> 10:00.600
hd tv of a larger size than any computer monitor

10:00.600 --> 10:04.140
sitting in their living room do you think we might benefit from it a little

10:04.140 --> 10:06.420
more because will have a better

10:06.420 --> 10:07.580
better visual

10:07.580 --> 10:08.540
to handle it

10:08.540 --> 10:11.580
I don't think so. The textures, like I said, aren't improved.

10:11.580 --> 10:15.420
If anything, it's going to be a little bit blurrier for you guys, but that's about it.

10:15.420 --> 10:19.500
You remember what I say, though. What's that? It's all about the gameplay.

10:19.500 --> 10:23.860
And it's still Final Fantasy 11! And it still has crap for gameplay!

10:23.860 --> 10:27.980
I don't want to sit here and bash 11 totally, unlike Jamie, because

10:27.980 --> 10:31.420
it was a lot. I played Final Fantasy 11 for like two years, okay? There's a lot to

10:31.420 --> 10:32.740
really like about the game,

10:32.740 --> 10:38.300
and I suppose that I can at least applaud this coming out on the Xbox 360

10:38.300 --> 10:42.560
because it's kind of making it more accessible to people who are turned off for whatever

10:42.560 --> 10:48.680
reason by PC gaming, but honestly, there's always these debates like console gamer, PC

10:48.680 --> 10:53.040
gamer, console gamer, PC gamer, you gotta, there's really good games on both.

10:53.040 --> 10:58.200
You know, I'd rather see, as much as I really hate Phantasy Star online, I'd rather see

10:58.200 --> 11:01.720
that on this, because at least that's a game I think that they would be able to benefit

11:01.720 --> 11:05.960
and they'd have a new graphics engine and stuff. This is just a straight port and they

11:05.960 --> 11:12.720
did nothing to it. They did not enhance anything on it. Now, I didn't see any lag. That may

11:12.720 --> 11:18.960
be the only thing, but other than that, I mean, I haven't even gotten far enough yet

11:18.960 --> 11:23.680
to see if there's any lag anywhere, but I'm not impressed, and I'm not going to be picking

11:23.680 --> 11:27.880
it up when it comes out. Interesting. Unless they give it to me for free. But no, actually

11:27.880 --> 11:31.800
no, I still won't pick it up because then I... Well, I am still paying for it right

11:31.800 --> 11:34.880
now and I'm not playing it. Exactly, exactly. Yeah, what the hell, okay, well if they give

11:34.880 --> 11:40.040
it to me for free, I'll play it, but that's about it. I don't think Square will be sending

11:40.040 --> 11:44.580
you one for free after hearing that little assessment of the beta, so we'll see. Put

11:44.580 --> 11:51.580
Kingdom Hearts on, like, freaking Xbox 360. That'd be cool. You can dream. By the way,

11:53.120 --> 11:57.680
assuming all goes well, I should actually have my Kingdom Hearts very, very soon. Oh,

11:57.680 --> 12:04.200
are you importing the one from Japan? Yes. Sweet. Alright. But I've also got my US one

12:04.200 --> 12:11.120
preorder cool anything else that you're playing this week Loki Grand Theft Auto

12:11.120 --> 12:16.520
lots of Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stores because I just can't get enough

12:16.520 --> 12:19.520
that game we've been playing all the death matches again we're actually kind

12:19.520 --> 12:23.400
of playing now with the cheat device a little bit because one of the things you

12:23.400 --> 12:28.200
can do the cheat devices manipulate the gravity in the game and it'll actually

12:28.200 --> 12:31.700
you can unload the cheat device and launch a multiplayer game with the

12:31.700 --> 12:37.780
gravity in place. So I for instance could have like 0.1 gravity and other people could

12:37.780 --> 12:45.360
be having just normal gravity and I'll jump way the fuck over them. So it's kind of fun.

12:45.360 --> 12:51.380
My gaming week has been nothing that special. I haven't really bought a new game. I thought

12:51.380 --> 12:55.100
about buying the Mega Man X collection because you know the Mega Man X collection came out

12:55.100 --> 12:59.740
this week. And then I was reminded by some reviews out there on the internet that, oh

12:59.740 --> 13:04.020
Megaman x4 and 5 kind of sucked so I

13:05.020 --> 13:09.020
Make it an x4 was kind of cool. Wait. No, I'm sorry five and six X

13:09.020 --> 13:11.780
But what was the last night last night had the sucker in it?

13:11.780 --> 13:15.980
Okay, I take it back x5 and x6 kind of sucked but then like well x1 was kind of cool

13:15.980 --> 13:18.100
Do I really want to pay all this again just to play?

13:18.100 --> 13:25.500
You know x1 if you want to get Megaman x1 get Megaman powered up or Maverick hunter X the remake for the PSP

13:25.500 --> 13:28.140
That's like 20 bucks. Is that out now? I

13:28.140 --> 13:31.660
I think it's coming out the first week in February.

13:31.660 --> 13:34.060
I saw some screens of that. That looked pretty hot.

13:34.060 --> 13:36.380
And I liked the whole design your own level mode.

13:36.380 --> 13:38.700
That's Mega Man Power.Mega Man, that's not...

13:38.700 --> 13:40.820
Oh, am I getting him backwards? My bad.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.820
Actually, I did want to ask you something about that.

13:43.820 --> 13:45.300
It's all the X games, right?

13:45.300 --> 13:51.460
Yeah, it's X1 through 6, and then they also put in something, some battle game.

13:51.460 --> 13:53.660
Oh, Rockman the Power Battles?

13:53.660 --> 13:55.340
No, because that was in the first one.

13:55.340 --> 13:56.820
No, it's the Mario Kart type game.

13:56.820 --> 14:01.200
Oh, okay. Battle and chase. That's it, battle and chase.

14:01.200 --> 14:05.160
Did you give X3 a try? Did it have the stupid box around it?

14:05.160 --> 14:10.640
Oh, I didn't actually play it. I thought about buying it. I didn't actually. Well, the thing is that I have Mega Man X3 on Saturn

14:10.640 --> 14:14.080
and we know it was also on the Super Nintendo or Super Primacon.

14:14.080 --> 14:19.000
The thing is that it put this weird box around it and it looks just like the Super Nintendo version.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.360
So I was asking if they gave it the same treatment. No idea.

14:22.360 --> 14:26.120
Maybe somebody in chat knows. Speaking of chat, chat has some feedback to what we've

14:26.120 --> 14:27.320
been talking about so far.

14:27.320 --> 14:31.120
For instance, Jaded2006 had a comment on Nintendogs.

14:31.120 --> 14:34.920
Nintendogs died because nobody wanted another pet rock.

14:34.920 --> 14:38.560
Kinda true there.

14:38.560 --> 14:42.000
Another point here, somebody made a point on Phantasy Star

14:42.000 --> 14:45.360
Online, I think it was Rini. Rini said,

14:45.360 --> 14:48.840
Loki, don't forget, even Phantasy Star Online charges you per month

14:48.840 --> 14:52.560
as well on top of the Xbox Live fees, at least the regular Xbox version does.

14:52.560 --> 14:56.280
But that's the one good thing about this whole like silver and gold thing that I

14:56.280 --> 14:58.760
see is that now we won't have that anymore, because that was my complaint about

14:58.760 --> 15:00.160
PSO on the Xbox too,

15:00.160 --> 15:03.880
which is too bad because PSO on the Xbox is like my favorite version.

15:03.880 --> 15:07.840
I did like the one on PC a whole lot, but Xbox had voice chat, come on.

15:07.840 --> 15:11.800
I was just... I guess you could use Teamspeak and stuff with the PC, but I don't know,

15:11.800 --> 15:12.360
there's something

15:12.360 --> 15:16.280
about having it all streamlined that's great. I'm hoping that there's gonna be an

15:16.280 --> 15:19.560
MMO coming out that's actually, you know,

15:19.560 --> 15:22.600
when you pay for gold, it's basically the same fee.

15:22.600 --> 15:25.840
It's applied to it, so I don't have to pay these extra fees.

15:25.840 --> 15:29.840
Alright, anyway, if you want to join our chatroom, mornsontrader.com, click on chat.

15:29.840 --> 15:30.760
Speaking of MMOs,

15:30.760 --> 15:33.680
one other game I've been playing this week, a lot more World of Warcraft,

15:33.680 --> 15:34.120
because,

15:34.120 --> 15:37.400
you know, Miek Latov, who was here on the show last week, convinced me to come back

15:37.400 --> 15:40.040
after my little hiatus, so I've been playing on his server,

15:40.040 --> 15:43.520
and I did our first instance.

15:43.520 --> 15:46.480
well I think I think that's what you call it when you do the dungeon with

15:46.480 --> 15:50.400
with party that's not high level we're only like level I think about about 16

15:50.400 --> 15:51.040
17

15:51.040 --> 15:54.160
and we're doing like a low-level dungeon I think they call it an instant still

15:54.160 --> 15:57.660
yeah cuz like a you know harder quest it was actually a lot of fun

15:57.660 --> 16:01.280
well the reason they're called instances because each dungeons loaded up for just

16:01.280 --> 16:02.120
your party I

16:02.120 --> 16:06.240
thought so I see it's a somebody was trying to tell me that was only in

16:06.240 --> 16:09.520
Guild Wars that that happened and that's true Guild Wars does that too but

16:09.520 --> 16:13.280
yeah I I realize that because none of the creatures were responding

16:13.280 --> 16:18.200
When we were going through the dungeon and I was like maybe this is like just for us when we go through yeah

16:18.200 --> 16:22.280
And that sure is so I like that was fun because the last time I play World of Warcraft

16:22.280 --> 16:27.360
I didn't I only got to like level 20 with one character and I didn't have a lot of other people I knew on the

16:27.360 --> 16:29.760
Server and I can be really anti-social on MMOs

16:29.920 --> 16:34.040
because like this is this is what they talk about in MMOs you sit there in the middle of the town and they're all talking about

16:34.160 --> 16:38.920
Chuck Norris and the you know the Chuck Norris facts website and it's like come on

16:39.160 --> 16:41.560
They're all acting like there's I don't want to talk to those people

16:41.560 --> 16:43.560
My roommate showed me how to block out the general chat.

16:43.560 --> 16:45.560
Yeah, please!

16:45.560 --> 16:47.560
G H, please.

16:47.560 --> 16:49.560
No, and this one, they're all shouting for instances, you know.

16:49.560 --> 16:51.560
WC party, need healer.

16:51.560 --> 16:53.560
RFC party, need healer.

16:55.560 --> 16:59.560
So now everybody knows I'm Horde on some server, because those are Horde quests.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.560
Anyway.

17:01.560 --> 17:03.560
Let's get into tonight's news, shall we?

17:03.560 --> 17:05.560
Alright, the news.

17:05.560 --> 17:07.560
Starting off the news tonight. Let's talk about the Gizmondo.

17:07.560 --> 17:11.340
about the gizmondo gizmondo is one of those things we saw at e3 and we were

17:11.340 --> 17:15.240
kind of like hey this this looks like it could be pretty cool well it is mondo

17:15.240 --> 17:19.400
well dark soccer what's going on with the gizmondo well it looks like Tiger

17:19.400 --> 17:26.600
telematics which is the parent company handling gizmondo stated that they've

17:26.600 --> 17:32.520
offered the stock IP and patents of smart ads subsidiary as an equity on a

17:32.520 --> 17:37.040
on a 21.2 million loan from their shareholders.

17:37.040 --> 17:37.880
Oopsie!

17:38.840 --> 17:42.080
Uh-oh, you mean the ad service wasn't a hit?

17:42.080 --> 17:44.340
Okay, basically the terms of the deal,

17:44.340 --> 17:46.840
the loan that was overdue to be repaid,

17:48.120 --> 17:51.100
and also just for our UK listeners,

17:51.100 --> 17:53.640
that's 12.68 million pounds.

17:54.520 --> 17:56.240
You know what this is like?

17:56.240 --> 17:57.720
This is like friends of mine who have been

17:57.720 --> 17:59.440
in very bad financial situations.

17:59.440 --> 18:01.680
They have to sell their car to pay the rent.

18:01.680 --> 18:04.600
That's kind of what this sounds like to me.

18:04.600 --> 18:07.400
Well, now, the catch on this one is that the loan

18:07.400 --> 18:11.640
has to be repaid by March 30th, unless Tiger

18:11.640 --> 18:17.080
can raise $75 million in new equity or debt by that date.

18:17.080 --> 18:20.400
Then the company says it's working on securing that.

18:20.400 --> 18:27.680
If it can get the $75 million, then $1.68 million of the loan

18:27.680 --> 18:29.400
must be repaid immediately in the remainder

18:29.400 --> 18:31.600
to come before June 30th.

18:31.600 --> 18:36.280
And if the company doesn't get it or can't repay it, the two shareholders will be taking

18:36.280 --> 18:37.280
over the smart ad system.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.840
You know, we could save this company.

18:39.840 --> 18:40.840
What?

18:40.840 --> 18:45.160
It's the same thing that saved other companies, sidetalking.

18:45.160 --> 18:46.720
Did you have something additional in this?

18:46.720 --> 18:47.720
No, I don't.

18:47.720 --> 18:48.720
No, nothing additional?

18:48.720 --> 18:53.880
Nothing additional other than, I'm not surprised.

18:53.880 --> 18:58.480
Why did the Gizmondo fail?

18:58.480 --> 19:01.000
Why did the Betamax fail?

19:01.000 --> 19:04.180
I think the Gizmondo failed because they didn't really have any

19:04.180 --> 19:07.540
big-name games to kind of draw us to the system. You know, the

19:07.540 --> 19:11.140
system's only as good as the games that are on it, right? And we saw this one game,

19:11.140 --> 19:12.240
Johnny, whatever, that looked,

19:12.240 --> 19:16.000
you know, whatever, it looked okay. But there was no, but there was no, like,

19:16.000 --> 19:18.320
big draw, but it wasn't a big draw, you know what I mean?

19:18.320 --> 19:21.480
And I never once, walking into a

19:21.480 --> 19:24.600
a large store, like Best Buy, Fry, never once

19:24.600 --> 19:28.560
have I seen a setup for Gizmondo. Well, Gizmondo, the problem with it also was

19:28.560 --> 19:30.280
the games that were launching on it were

19:30.280 --> 19:34.800
last-generation games. Also they have this wonderful

19:34.800 --> 19:38.320
ad service in there where you have to watch ads in order to shut your system off.

19:38.320 --> 19:42.800
Oh, I remember that. Ooh, that's fun. And also possibly talking about a redesign of

19:42.800 --> 19:44.720
the system before the system launches.

19:44.720 --> 19:48.800
Well, that's a great idea. That'll get people to buy your system.

19:48.800 --> 19:55.400
Alright. Well, at least their system came out. That's more than we could say

19:55.400 --> 19:56.000
about

19:56.000 --> 20:00.720
about the Phantom. Exactly. Well, it's not over till it's over, but

20:00.720 --> 20:06.200
you know, it's over. Moving on, other stories. I have a story here about the

20:06.200 --> 20:07.080
ninth annual

20:07.080 --> 20:10.800
Interactive Achievement Awards, because you know, it's award season,

20:10.800 --> 20:15.060
and there's, you know, this group, the Interactive Achievement Awards,

20:15.060 --> 20:19.020
they're handing out awards, and here's what's nominated for Game of the Year.

20:19.020 --> 20:20.200
God of War,

20:20.200 --> 20:23.360
Guitar Hero, Shadow of the Colossus,

20:23.360 --> 20:28.560
Call of Duty 2 and Nintendogs, you notice what's missing from this list?

20:28.560 --> 20:32.680
Resident Evil 4, which is getting a lot of awards.

20:32.680 --> 20:35.760
So it's kind of interesting. And I don't know, maybe it missed the eligibility point or

20:35.760 --> 20:36.280
something, because

20:36.280 --> 20:40.040
Resident Evil 4 came out really, really early in 2005, so maybe it just narrowly missed some

20:40.040 --> 20:40.720
type of

20:40.720 --> 20:44.280
eligibility window, I don't know. Computer Games nominated,

20:44.280 --> 20:47.600
Fear, Civilization 4, Battlefield 2,

20:47.600 --> 20:52.580
Age of Empires 3, and the movies. Just a whole, whole lot of categories here. I'm

20:52.580 --> 20:55.220
I'm obviously not going to sit here and read them all, but I thought it was interesting

20:55.220 --> 20:59.320
because they have a cellular game of the year and nobody really ever talks about cell phone

20:59.320 --> 21:04.780
games because most of them suck, but this might clue you into what a couple of the good

21:04.780 --> 21:12.700
ones are, Mile High Pinball, Skipping Stone, 1, Ancient Empires 2, and High Seas, none

21:12.700 --> 21:17.200
of which I've ever heard of on my cell phone, but I have Sprint and they have like different

21:17.200 --> 21:18.660
games than the other people I think.

21:18.660 --> 21:22.060
I always delete them, I like have Bejeweled on my phone or something.

21:22.060 --> 21:25.260
I had bejeweled multiplayer for a little while, and it was alright.

21:25.260 --> 21:29.060
I had Castlevania on the cell phone, which was cool for like five minutes, because it

21:29.060 --> 21:32.100
was like, dude, it's just like Castlevania 1, but then you realize I'm trying to play

21:32.100 --> 21:37.020
a game on my cell phone, and the action is like, so choppy, it's pretty bad.

21:37.020 --> 21:41.540
So it's one of those things, like, I got this to listen to the theme music once in a while.

21:41.540 --> 21:42.940
I don't know.

21:42.940 --> 21:46.460
I don't know what else there is to say about that.

21:46.460 --> 21:49.860
Moving on, Loki, what's going on in Nintendo's world?

21:49.860 --> 21:56.860
Speaking of things that are new for this year, well, they've basically come out, Reggie, he

21:56.860 --> 22:03.780
likes to talk up their new systems coming out and stuff, and kind of gave a bit, talking

22:03.780 --> 22:09.780
to Sina, he kind of showed what their focus was for this year, mainly the stuff that they're

22:09.780 --> 22:11.940
kind of trying to do with the revolution.

22:11.940 --> 22:19.640
For example, they want to basically make their system more approachable to everybody by first

22:19.640 --> 22:23.120
having a lower price tag than everybody else and also just kind of

22:23.120 --> 22:25.880
probably making sure they have enough units out there and maybe launching on

22:25.880 --> 22:26.880
time for everyone

22:26.880 --> 22:30.080
you know what's interesting is that I seem to remember that was a big part of

22:30.080 --> 22:31.420
their um...

22:31.420 --> 22:34.480
talk behind that controller when they first showed the pictures of the

22:34.480 --> 22:36.320
revolution controller they were like hey

22:36.320 --> 22:40.720
everybody's used a TV remote so this makes it kind of accessible to everybody

22:40.720 --> 22:45.380
which is an interesting argument yeah that way it's so anybody you know your grandma

22:45.380 --> 22:48.880
can go pick up this game and figure out how to do this okay

22:48.880 --> 22:53.400
If I need to slash a sword, I make a motion like I'm slashing a sword. It makes perfect sense.

22:53.400 --> 22:57.160
Also, they're just basically focusing on entertainment

22:57.160 --> 23:00.320
because, you know, the whole thing is no matter, you know, what your specs are of

23:00.320 --> 23:01.520
course it's

23:01.520 --> 23:05.000
you know, what we've been saying before, your console's only as good as the games.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.880
So, focus on the good games and

23:07.880 --> 23:09.440
pretty much

23:09.440 --> 23:13.280
you know, that's about it. It's basically just

23:13.280 --> 23:17.160
focusing on entertainment, making sure that their product is accessible to everybody

23:17.160 --> 23:20.680
and that's how they think they're gonna win the next-gen

23:20.680 --> 23:23.880
did he say anything about actually putting out twilight princess this year

23:23.880 --> 23:25.980
that should be one of their goals i think

23:25.980 --> 23:29.660
who have you noticed all has been kind of quiet on the twilight princess front

23:29.660 --> 23:32.200
i don't know if this is still coming up still cut because we're in a quiet

23:32.200 --> 23:35.300
period right now it's kind of a slow news period right now

23:35.300 --> 23:37.940
but i don't know is just what will you laughing over there i'm laughing at the

23:37.940 --> 23:40.060
book reference now

23:40.060 --> 23:41.980
but i had to read that

23:41.980 --> 23:42.820
anyway

23:42.820 --> 23:44.820
uh... but no i

23:44.820 --> 23:46.140
i think that

23:46.140 --> 23:49.300
the point that they start being very quiet about something that either means

23:49.300 --> 23:51.740
one or two things, something's going very well

23:51.740 --> 23:55.420
or something is going horrendously wrong. What do you think is the case in the

23:55.420 --> 23:58.260
PlayStation 3 which has also been very very quiet lately?

23:58.260 --> 24:01.740
Horribly wrong. I've got theories on this one but

24:01.740 --> 24:05.900
my comments on that are coming up on later issues. Alright fine.

24:05.900 --> 24:09.900
My thing is I think they're starting to get towards the end here

24:09.900 --> 24:12.860
they're starting to get towards their dates that they said they were

24:12.860 --> 24:15.780
gonna hit and they're nowhere near hitting those dates and

24:15.780 --> 24:23.540
I think that it's a bad sign right now seen is that none of the actual alpha kits have gone out for the PS3 and

24:24.120 --> 24:28.440
So far we haven't yet to see an actual playable demo or anything. That's actually running

24:29.480 --> 24:34.160
you know while we've seen some you know demos running on the hardware, but nothing playable and

24:35.200 --> 24:39.520
The fact that you know the beta kits aren't even out this thing's nowhere near production

24:39.520 --> 24:44.400
No one knows what the cost is no one knows when it's coming out. I I'm not even sure it's coming out this year

24:44.400 --> 24:50.080
Interesting feedback here from SSJ 100 Matt, Nintendo's stocks are up six percent

24:50.080 --> 24:53.480
and I do remember reading an article on this is that after there was that big

24:53.480 --> 24:57.400
spiel about you know Nintendo will or the revolution will not be above this

24:57.400 --> 25:01.120
price the stocks went up. I remember reading somewhere on the internet I don't

25:01.120 --> 25:03.920
think the story made the cut for tonight but I remember seeing that somewhere on

25:03.920 --> 25:06.680
the internet I thought it was kind of neat. Now I'm not sure if they're gonna be able to do

25:06.680 --> 25:11.760
under $299 but let's just say they do $199 that thing's gonna fly off shelves

25:11.760 --> 25:15.720
it's gonna be flying especially when you consider what you know that's like

25:15.720 --> 25:17.640
three games for the 360

25:17.640 --> 25:21.880
yeah it it's gonna be but you also have to consider what do you get with it

25:21.880 --> 25:24.920
you know like is it gonna be $1.99 and then you have to buy

25:24.920 --> 25:29.480
a controller and you know some other stuff on top of you know what are you getting for

25:29.480 --> 25:33.120
that $1.99? Wait, you're getting the controller plus the nunchuck attachment

25:33.120 --> 25:37.100
and they're also going to be having speculation this is all speculation of

25:37.100 --> 25:38.200
course. Well that's what they've said

25:38.200 --> 25:41.280
that's going to be included with it. You read something I did?

25:41.280 --> 25:45.920
well this was a while back, they're also gonna be having you know obviously the service

25:45.920 --> 25:48.840
we can play the old retro games I'm sure that they're gonna have

25:48.840 --> 25:51.880
you know some of those you can play for free as well as some

25:51.880 --> 25:55.000
that you could probably pay for the service and stuff

25:55.000 --> 25:58.960
but probably gonna have a couple launch games

25:58.960 --> 26:01.760
but I think it's not going to be as expensive because if you look at even

26:01.760 --> 26:03.640
GameCube games and look at

26:03.640 --> 26:07.960
Nintendo DS games and stuff, they're never as expensive as PSP games or

26:07.960 --> 26:10.640
anything like that and I understand okay maybe the graphics are as good

26:10.640 --> 26:14.560
So what? But it's still a game. It's not as expensive, though.

26:14.560 --> 26:18.220
The highest I ever see a Nintendo DS game is usually about

26:18.220 --> 26:21.480
$35. I'd say about $35 is as high as I've seen it, too.

26:21.480 --> 26:24.520
I think that's what I paid for, um...

26:24.520 --> 26:28.360
Oh, hell. Kirby!

26:28.360 --> 26:31.040
Oh, not Kirby, because that was a present.

26:31.040 --> 26:34.800
I know there's something I bought that was $35. I had to probably touch and go when I

26:34.800 --> 26:35.480
first bought it.

26:35.480 --> 26:38.800
Yeah. That's why I got it confused. It's the same game. It's just Kirby's a lot better.

26:38.800 --> 26:41.940
yeah anyway moving on

26:41.940 --> 26:45.260
I'm now a follow-up to something we talked about last week we talked about

26:45.260 --> 26:48.080
this Nintendo DS redesign was on the way and

26:48.080 --> 26:51.100
and there's gonna be this whole great announcement on Monday and then what

26:51.100 --> 26:51.960
happened Loki

26:51.960 --> 26:55.660
I have a Monday the only answer was that there's not a redesign Christian say

26:55.660 --> 26:57.880
there wasn't going to be redesigned so

26:57.880 --> 27:01.460
ever they say there was a new be really never they basically said

27:01.460 --> 27:05.260
I'm we have no news to basically a

27:05.260 --> 27:08.380
you know our system is awesome we have no news

27:08.380 --> 27:11.780
regarding, you know, redesign. It says

27:11.780 --> 27:14.780
but we have nothing to announce at this time. Nothing to announce

27:14.780 --> 27:19.420
at this time. That's the key word. Meaning that there is going to be a redesign just not right

27:19.420 --> 27:21.800
now. Probably something that they'll save for E3

27:21.800 --> 27:25.380
or if there is going to be a redesign. Nintendo cannot

27:25.380 --> 27:29.060
they cannot stand to leave something alone. There's always going to be a redesign.

27:29.060 --> 27:32.860
You know what? I've seen great, great arguments out there on the internet

27:32.860 --> 27:33.340
though

27:33.340 --> 27:37.740
you know when people were debunking this. It's like, you know, if it's not broke, why fix

27:37.740 --> 27:42.380
DS's are still selling like hell and somebody else sent me an article that also didn't make

27:42.380 --> 27:46.700
the cut for tonight, but talking about how the Japanese are really really pushing to

27:46.700 --> 27:52.020
get DS's back on shelves, they're even importing them back in the country and just crazy stuff,

27:52.020 --> 27:53.020
you know.

27:53.020 --> 27:54.360
So if it's not broke, why fix it?

27:54.360 --> 28:00.500
They won't need to put out a new DS until DS sales slow down, which as long as they

28:00.500 --> 28:03.580
keep putting out really solid games for it, probably isn't going to happen anytime soon.

28:03.580 --> 28:07.420
With Tetris DS right around the corner, I think that's going to be a big motivator for

28:07.420 --> 28:10.500
more systems. All they would have to do to make more of those systems fly out the

28:10.500 --> 28:10.940
shells,

28:10.940 --> 28:15.260
shoot, do another $20 price cut. Tetris DS and you also have

28:15.260 --> 28:19.540
same month is gonna be Metroid Prime hunters. It's gonna be a huge month

28:19.540 --> 28:22.780
for DS. And what's PSP got on the horizon?

28:22.780 --> 28:26.580
What's PSP have? They have the new Splinter Cell Essentials.

28:26.580 --> 28:29.820
Katamari is coming out in March.

28:29.820 --> 28:34.540
They've got a new... I'm trying to think if there's anything else that is really big.

28:34.540 --> 28:37.640
They have a lot of, there's 29 games for the PSP coming out

28:37.640 --> 28:40.520
in March, so I mean that's a lot of stuff.

28:40.520 --> 28:45.720
You know, speaking of DS, it's not on the outline for tonight's show, but

28:45.720 --> 28:46.960
you had something about

28:46.960 --> 28:50.160
Phoenix Wright, the DS game. What happened with this?

28:50.160 --> 28:54.160
Another too popular for its own good? It is too popular for its own good,

28:54.160 --> 28:57.360
and unfortunately if you don't have one right now and there are none

28:57.360 --> 29:01.440
in your local store, you're not going to be seeing it until March. Because,

29:01.440 --> 29:06.080
um like most Japanese games they get produced in Japan it's gonna be a six

29:06.080 --> 29:07.200
week turnaround time

29:07.200 --> 29:10.440
because Capcom is sold out of them right now

29:10.440 --> 29:13.560
and no way you can get one until

29:13.560 --> 29:17.760
March well yeah February March ish

29:17.760 --> 29:23.180
well well well crazy alright well enough about what's going on in Japan and over

29:23.180 --> 29:27.120
here in the US how about our buddies over in the UK dark soccer like to keep

29:27.120 --> 29:28.520
tabs on what's going on

29:28.520 --> 29:32.080
overseas the other way and fills us in with

29:32.080 --> 29:37.160
the UK report. Well, we actually have an update

29:37.160 --> 29:41.400
that the UK DS sales reached 1 million.

29:41.400 --> 29:45.440
They have surpassed that 1 million unit sale,

29:45.440 --> 29:50.160
which is pretty big since it's been out less than a year

29:50.160 --> 29:53.680
over there.

29:53.680 --> 29:57.040
They said that several of the major retailers

29:57.040 --> 30:00.600
in the UK were completely sold out of the systems too

30:00.600 --> 30:03.720
and so people have to wait for quite a while.

30:03.720 --> 30:09.040
World wide sales are a good bit higher than 13 million now.

30:09.040 --> 30:12.520
Wow, Nintendo just

30:12.520 --> 30:15.920
knows how to do their handhelds, what can you say? Yeah, they are the pros.

30:15.920 --> 30:21.560
Also, Dead or Alive 4 has a UK release date.

30:21.560 --> 30:25.520
They said it will ship on January 27th.

30:25.520 --> 30:28.720
For those of you guys that need your booby fix, it's on its way.

30:28.720 --> 30:36.640
I warn you, the whole reaction system in that, that game's a pain in the ass.

30:36.640 --> 30:40.360
And it's all, the last boss is the biggest cheeseball in the universe.

30:40.360 --> 30:43.480
I'd like to mention something real quick about DOA4 that makes no sense to me.

30:43.480 --> 30:49.440
Okay, I was playing that game, and there was one cutscene that they have where one of the

30:49.440 --> 30:53.040
female characters is trying to buy a head of lettuce.

30:53.040 --> 30:59.120
And this other female character, who seemed to be of royalty or something, took the lettuce

30:59.120 --> 31:01.320
away from her, and then they fought.

31:01.320 --> 31:03.440
What the hell is that for a story?

31:03.440 --> 31:05.860
They're fighting over a goddamn head of lettuce.

31:05.860 --> 31:06.860
That was so retarded.

31:06.860 --> 31:10.160
And by the way, their boob's about way too much in this game still.

31:10.160 --> 31:11.560
On the next Jerry Springer.

31:11.560 --> 31:13.480
No, you have to set the age.

31:13.480 --> 31:17.160
We've got the age set to 30, I think.

31:17.160 --> 31:18.160
Because of Dan.

31:18.160 --> 31:20.280
Because he likes bouncy boobies.

31:20.280 --> 31:22.160
Oh wait, you actually set the age.

31:22.160 --> 31:24.200
I haven't played this yet, so you set the age and that...

31:24.200 --> 31:29.560
Yeah, if you don't want a lot of, you know, bouncy boobs and panty shots, then you can

31:29.560 --> 31:31.720
set the age to, like, one.

31:31.720 --> 31:34.280
So if you set it to, like, 70, it's, like, really perverted?

31:34.280 --> 31:39.280
I think the highest it goes is 30, but, um, the last DOA game had, uh, an unlock that

31:39.280 --> 31:43.420
you could put your age to 99, and it was like... everywhere.

31:43.420 --> 31:45.840
So your age determines the bounce.

31:45.840 --> 31:47.840
That's, uh, weird.

31:47.840 --> 31:48.840
Yeah.

31:48.840 --> 31:50.600
Anything else in the UK?

31:50.600 --> 31:54.220
yes actually a game I'm actually pretty excited about in fact I'm

31:54.220 --> 31:57.460
I might be doing something regarding

31:57.460 --> 32:00.660
a translation of this game for the US but

32:00.660 --> 32:04.020
that's another story. Tales of Fantasia

32:04.020 --> 32:07.100
a Japanese RPG is going to be out on the

32:07.100 --> 32:13.060
Gameboy in March in the UK and I'm actually pretty excited about that game

32:13.060 --> 32:17.360
because Tales of Fantasia has a pretty unique battle system

32:17.360 --> 32:21.920
I've seen a bit of it in action, the Japanese version, pretty cool intro too.

32:21.920 --> 32:26.960
But it was out on the Super Famicom

32:26.960 --> 32:30.840
back in the day. And of course, was it Tales of Symphonia?

32:30.840 --> 32:36.040
And another game, one on PlayStation 2 and the other on GameCube

32:36.040 --> 32:39.080
came out in the United States but we never did see Tales of Fantasia.

32:39.080 --> 32:43.920
So I think it's pretty exciting that there's going to be a release for that on

32:43.920 --> 32:45.240
the Game Boy Advance.

32:45.240 --> 32:48.020
Of course, it's gonna be out in Europe at the end of March very cool

32:48.020 --> 32:52.380
And then the United States sometime beginning the March very cool

32:53.220 --> 33:00.460
All right. Thank you for that. Mark. Sakura. You're quite welcome. Our folks overseas. Appreciate you. They better they better appreciate you guys

33:00.620 --> 33:04.340
All right, you know interesting comment here in the chat room

33:05.260 --> 33:11.900
Summing up the dead or alive for story that Loki was telling us about dark Tetsuya says DOA for has a story

33:11.900 --> 33:18.020
I think perfectly sums it up right there it's all about John Lee's ending which

33:18.020 --> 33:23.100
is hilarious blink blink I'm not gonna spoil it because people have to get the

33:23.100 --> 33:30.260
game and play it but it's like trumpet what's up with that fine all right

33:30.260 --> 33:34.900
moving on to another article speaking of something coming out for the Game Boy

33:34.900 --> 33:40.900
Advance pretty soon we've got Dr. Sudoku there's a brand new title coming out

33:40.900 --> 33:45.040
based off Sudoku you know what Sudoku is right it's that puzzle game that has the

33:45.040 --> 33:49.380
one through nine and you you you can only use each number once in a row and

33:49.380 --> 33:52.720
in a column and in each nine three by three box and you can't go into a Barnes

33:52.720 --> 33:56.060
and Noble without finding books on it everywhere exactly it's this huge puzzle

33:56.060 --> 34:01.020
craze so of course you know they think hmm puzzle Game Boy Advance Tetris

34:01.020 --> 34:06.220
best-selling game well shit we need to put Sudoku out there so Dr. Sudoku is

34:06.220 --> 34:11.220
coming out in February it's got more than 1,000 puzzles and of course will be

34:11.220 --> 34:16.500
the first of many many Sudoku games to hit various game systems just like

34:16.500 --> 34:21.940
Tetris just like World Championship poker games and all that stuff what do

34:21.940 --> 34:28.020
you think next big thing or just whatever maybe if I ignore it it'll go

34:28.020 --> 34:32.820
away you know what's interesting I don't understand like the sudden interest in

34:32.820 --> 34:36.540
Sudoku because these puzzle books that they've sold in store I remember these

34:36.540 --> 34:40.020
from when I was younger like you know I was such a nerd that my parents could

34:40.020 --> 34:44.060
buy me one of these books and we would go on a road trip and I'd shut up for a

34:44.060 --> 34:50.160
long time and these Sudoku puzzles appeared in the books I want to say

34:50.160 --> 34:53.560
it's like penny press or somebody puts out these books you can get them in

34:53.560 --> 34:56.660
supermarkets these Sudoku puzzles appeared in these books a long time ago

34:56.660 --> 34:59.220
except they were called something else had something with a more English title

34:59.220 --> 35:02.020
like it was like crypto numbers or something was like the name of the

35:02.020 --> 35:06.940
puzzles and why now is this stuff all the rage that's what I I'm not getting

35:06.940 --> 35:12.100
people are trend whores I guess but it's just really weird you know and I'll

35:12.100 --> 35:15.860
admit I've done a couple Sudoku puzzles like recently I was in a waiting room

35:15.860 --> 35:18.940
for a long time and I was like you know there's New York Times and I was like oh

35:18.940 --> 35:24.940
Sudoku I'll do the puzzle there but I don't know I can't see myself spending

35:24.940 --> 35:28.180
money to buy this on Game Boy Advance you know I do think it's popularity is

35:28.180 --> 35:30.860
a good thing because it's something that encourages people to actually use their

35:30.860 --> 35:38.260
brains true true but you know I don't know I but it also to me Game Boy

35:38.260 --> 35:42.700
Advance wouldn't match for me just the pen and paper version of doing it you

35:42.700 --> 35:48.060
know imagine that having fun with pen and paper I know it's a it's a strange

35:48.060 --> 35:53.300
concept for some gamer folks but you know go figure well you know there are

35:53.300 --> 35:58.420
people who have actually forgotten how to write from typing so much hmm it

35:58.420 --> 36:02.020
actually is a sort of epidemic thing in Japan where people have forgotten how to

36:02.020 --> 36:08.260
write certain kanji because when you type you can select it from a list

36:08.260 --> 36:13.140
interesting comment I'm reading chatroom for some comments on Sudoku Rini says

36:13.140 --> 36:17.860
that Dr. Sudoku will be a battery drainer let's see

36:17.860 --> 36:22.480
Ninst says it's the rage now because someone slapped a foreign word on it so

36:22.480 --> 36:26.320
yes whores and Zander C has the same thing it's popular now because it has

36:26.320 --> 36:30.400
the Japanese name now and then of course Wonder Dog Harold says they should have

36:30.400 --> 36:36.480
a Pokemon Sudoku game that's nice that's how they sold Tetris attack nobody

36:36.480 --> 36:39.160
bought Tetris attack on as well a couple people did but not a lot of people bought

36:39.160 --> 36:42.280
Tetris attack when it was first out and had Yoshi and stuff slap some Pokemon

36:42.280 --> 36:45.640
characters on it put it on the n64 Pokemon puzzle league is that why

36:45.640 --> 36:52.000
Tetris DS has the retro Mario and Zelda characters in it probably probably and

36:52.000 --> 36:57.120
and then of course we have VX Jason XV our lovely webmaster we love him in

36:57.120 --> 36:57.720
chat says

36:57.720 --> 37:02.080
you can't erase paper get an eraser mate get one of those eraser mate pens

37:02.080 --> 37:06.320
yes you can erase paper that's part of the frustration of Sudoku

37:06.320 --> 37:10.720
at least a couple times I did it alright anyway

37:10.720 --> 37:14.560
moving on I did Sudoku once but I'm trying to cut back

37:14.560 --> 37:18.920
I know it sounds it sounds kinda scandalous doesn't it Sudoku

37:18.920 --> 37:24.920
Loki, what's going on in the movie world? We have, oh my god, House of the Dead 2?

37:24.920 --> 37:26.920
They're making a House of the Dead 2?

37:26.920 --> 37:28.920
That was exactly my reaction.

37:28.920 --> 37:29.920
Dear God, why?

37:29.920 --> 37:34.920
When I saw it on our list of movies, you know, upcoming movies, I was like,

37:34.920 --> 37:38.920
why the hell would they make a sequel to that? Didn't they lose enough money on the first one?

37:38.920 --> 37:39.920
And it's not U.E. Bull this time.

37:39.920 --> 37:40.920
It's not U.E. Bull.

37:40.920 --> 37:41.920
So it might be good.

37:41.920 --> 37:44.920
It might be that rare sequel that's better than the original.

37:44.920 --> 37:49.960
are you have to remember it's not just a director that ruins a movie okay you

37:49.960 --> 37:54.920
have the same writers as the you know alone the dark and house the dead in

37:54.920 --> 37:58.320
this one it's also scary as you have these same writers are doing a dead or

37:58.320 --> 38:03.480
alive movie as if you couldn't tell that one was gonna suck now what's great

38:03.480 --> 38:07.020
though is this movie it says it picks up where the last film left off where the

38:07.020 --> 38:11.720
government operatives investigate the island and the mysterious house so in

38:11.720 --> 38:17.680
In other words, the first game, because the last one was a prequel to everything.

38:17.680 --> 38:21.160
So is that like Jurassic Park 2 when they went back to the island to research the dinosaurs?

38:21.160 --> 38:22.160
I don't know, but...

38:22.160 --> 38:25.640
Are they going to whip out keyboards and have letters pop up in front of the zombies, or...

38:25.640 --> 38:27.640
Is Julianne Moore going to be in it, because, you know...

38:27.640 --> 38:31.480
No, not Julianne Moore, but you have sticky fingers, is going to be it.

38:31.480 --> 38:32.480
Oh, God.

38:32.480 --> 38:36.120
I just hope it has some of the cheeseball dialogue that was in the game.

38:36.120 --> 38:37.520
There was nothing we could do.

38:37.520 --> 38:38.520
Let me play this way, folks.

38:38.520 --> 38:42.360
if you're gonna if do not buy this when it comes out on DVD instead you can

38:42.360 --> 38:45.200
watch it for free when it premieres on sci-fi on

38:45.200 --> 38:49.120
February 11th. Yeah but it won't have titty on sci-fi. Well it's not gonna have titty anyways

38:49.120 --> 38:50.040
probably

38:50.040 --> 38:54.960
well actually no nudity and brief sexuality okay well yeah so no nudity

38:54.960 --> 38:58.320
in the sci-fi version but really are you missing anything no you're not

38:58.320 --> 39:01.600
but it might be one of those movies is so bad it's good

39:01.600 --> 39:05.400
you know like one of my favorite like blood rain like showgirls one of my

39:05.400 --> 39:06.900
favorite movies of all time

39:06.900 --> 39:11.400
So bad, it's good. No, it's it's and like if you watch it on vh1

39:11.400 --> 39:16.700
It's even worse because they draw the bras on and everything. I love showgirls because so so bad

39:17.280 --> 39:22.760
Anyways, you don't know shit if you are, you know, if you are masochist when it comes to actually

39:22.920 --> 39:28.500
You're watching these movies. The DVD will be released in United States on March 21st

39:28.500 --> 39:34.420
as well as also debuting on sci-fi channel on February 11th, so check it out.

39:34.420 --> 39:39.460
Well let me set my TiVo now. Let's talk about a more promising movie, shall we?

39:39.460 --> 39:46.100
Let's talk about Silent Hill. The trailer hit the internet this week and it's

39:46.100 --> 39:49.780
getting a really good reaction. I've already made two icons from it.

39:49.780 --> 39:54.340
Have you seen that the Silent Hill website now is updated and changed?

39:54.340 --> 39:57.740
It looks awesome. They did this whole flash thing with it where it

39:57.740 --> 40:00.820
looks all nice at first and like it was creepy on you all of a sudden and they

40:00.820 --> 40:04.580
got like cool backdrops and stuff it's welcome to silent Hill calm did you did

40:04.580 --> 40:08.300
you guys all watch the trailer yes what you think yes I did as I made to I call

40:08.300 --> 40:13.380
it you know I had to ask yeah oh it looks like it's for a lot of the stuff

40:13.380 --> 40:17.620
in it has the same feel that the games do mm-hmm and like especially the scenes

40:17.620 --> 40:24.140
with the nurses mm-hmm oh yeah that's yeah and pyramid head I it's it's great

40:24.140 --> 40:29.020
because it seems like it really is gonna be a great video game adaptation.

40:29.020 --> 40:30.980
These guys paid attention to the games.

40:30.980 --> 40:36.640
And granted the story's a lot different, but we kind of have the characters from Silent

40:36.640 --> 40:42.100
Hill 1 in a way, or the ambiance of Silent Hill 1 and the music.

40:42.100 --> 40:46.160
We have a lot of the characters from Silent Hill 2, and then kind of the look of Silent

40:46.160 --> 40:49.660
Hill 3 towards the end of the trailer, it looks a lot like Silent Hill 3, so it's kind

40:49.660 --> 40:51.460
of got all of that.

40:51.460 --> 40:56.420
signs of Silent Hill 4, but I suppose they want to leave room for a sequel or something.

40:56.420 --> 40:59.740
But the cool thing I thought about the trailer was that they used music from the games in

40:59.740 --> 41:05.500
the trailer, and we heard that Akira was going to do the soundtrack, then he wasn't, then

41:05.500 --> 41:08.820
some other guy was going to do it, and it was going to be inspired by Akira Yomoka's

41:08.820 --> 41:09.820
original score.

41:09.820 --> 41:13.380
So I don't know if this is some of the score that's actually going to be in the movie,

41:13.380 --> 41:14.380
but this is it.

41:14.380 --> 41:17.380
This is great, because somebody just basically re-recorded what Akira Yomoka did.

41:17.380 --> 41:18.380
It's awesome.

41:18.380 --> 41:19.620
It fits the trailer very well.

41:19.620 --> 41:23.980
He said he's going to be using elements from the original, so I think that that's more

41:23.980 --> 41:25.620
where we got a lot of that from.

41:25.620 --> 41:29.900
Well, usually I don't run out to go see these movies, but this one's actually one I'm looking

41:29.900 --> 41:30.980
forward to.

41:30.980 --> 41:37.500
The trailer's a little eh, but as far as the way they did it, it makes it a little cheesy.

41:37.500 --> 41:42.420
But it looks good, and especially if you watch the teaser, the way they did the teaser trailer,

41:42.420 --> 41:43.420
it's really...

41:43.420 --> 41:45.060
The teaser was awesome.

41:45.060 --> 41:46.060
That was awesome.

41:46.060 --> 41:48.340
That had the total style of Silent Hill and everything.

41:48.340 --> 41:51.860
And especially towards the end of the trailer when they show Pyramid Head again, you know,

41:51.860 --> 41:54.820
it's going to be just awesome.

41:54.820 --> 41:58.540
I'm scared I'm going to be really let down, because my expectations now are so, so high

41:58.540 --> 41:59.860
for this movie.

41:59.860 --> 42:01.700
I'm really scared I'm going to get let down by it.

42:01.700 --> 42:06.640
I think it's one of those films, at some point they're going to have to be good.

42:06.640 --> 42:10.020
They're going to have to start being good, and I think what people need is a movie that

42:10.020 --> 42:15.140
set the bar so that people will stop going to see these piece of crap movies that we

42:15.140 --> 42:20.220
Bowl puts out, because they're really bad and they need to like have some people out

42:20.220 --> 42:24.360
there go, you know what, this is what a video game movie should look like, I'm not paying

42:24.360 --> 42:28.360
to see this crap, stop putting this crap out, you know, talk to these studios, that's what

42:28.360 --> 42:29.360
they need to be doing.

42:29.360 --> 42:35.460
I honestly, I would have to say, because they would have to get that degree of accuracy

42:35.460 --> 42:41.940
and to keep the story that far in line, they'd have to be working fairly close with the creating

42:41.940 --> 42:42.940
team out of Konami.

42:42.940 --> 42:47.500
Well, you know the Konami logo shows up at the end of the trailer, so that was kinda cool, so...

42:47.500 --> 42:51.300
I mean, I suppose that's a property rights thing anyway, but, you know, I'm still promising.

42:51.300 --> 42:55.820
But that also offers hope, though, that if Konami is getting in on that and making it so...

42:56.540 --> 42:57.300
good, you know?

42:57.300 --> 42:58.580
That they won't fuck up Metal Gear?

43:00.060 --> 43:01.180
I'm- I- I want...

43:01.380 --> 43:02.460
Or Castlevania, which we-

43:02.460 --> 43:04.460
I want so bad for a Metal Gear movie.

43:04.740 --> 43:07.340
Yeah, but you heard those rumors that U.E. Bull was looking at the script?

43:07.340 --> 43:09.900
I don't know, I think it was just rumors that started by somebody.

43:09.900 --> 43:15.880
I think that in this case, I really pray that his reputation is a heated we'll see

43:16.920 --> 43:23.720
Alright moving on now, you know, there's lots of things that lazy people do and one of them is watching a lot of movies

43:24.120 --> 43:28.120
One thing could be playing a lot of games. In fact, one of these

43:28.640 --> 43:34.200
Folks who lost a lot of weight recently has been in the media says that games made him fat right Loki

43:34.280 --> 43:35.820
What's going on with this?

43:35.820 --> 43:37.520
well

43:37.520 --> 43:43.800
Jared and he was apparently a big Nintendo fan Jared like the subway guy. Yeah. Oh, okay that guy

43:44.120 --> 43:49.680
Yeah, he he was a big Nintendo fan a big fan. But anyways, yeah apparently

43:50.560 --> 43:53.680
little too addicted to the home console system and

43:55.200 --> 44:01.380
Didn't really he ended up being about nearly 425 pounds just sitting there playing his Nintendo

44:01.380 --> 44:06.380
No, I don't think Nintendo is the sole thing to blame here, obviously.

44:06.380 --> 44:13.380
He needs to be blaming himself for not getting his ass up off the couch and going outside and exercising.

44:13.380 --> 44:17.380
He has himself to blame, and trust me, I've lost 80 pounds.

44:17.380 --> 44:24.380
I know that what it took from me was getting my ass up off from in front of the TV and going and working out and eating right.

44:24.380 --> 44:26.380
He had to have done the same thing, right?

44:26.380 --> 44:32.740
right yeah he says he had um you know one hand on the controller one hand in a

44:32.740 --> 44:37.660
bag of chips so you know who we need to come in after potato chips they're the

44:37.660 --> 44:42.300
root of all evil to take responsibility for himself and you blame it on his own

44:42.300 --> 44:48.060
personal weakness people themselves are responsible for their own health okay

44:48.060 --> 44:53.340
here here devil's advocate for a minute is Nintendo and enabler or video games

44:53.340 --> 44:54.340
in general.

44:54.340 --> 44:55.340
It was still his choice.

44:55.340 --> 44:56.340
It was just there.

44:56.340 --> 44:57.340
No.

44:57.340 --> 44:59.700
It's the same thing as sitting and watching pay per view all day.

44:59.700 --> 45:01.280
I kind of call it the same thing.

45:01.280 --> 45:05.900
Video games in that regard are no different from sitting on the couch watching pay per

45:05.900 --> 45:15.860
view, porn, wrestling, porn, internet, chat rooms, you know, it's all the same.

45:15.860 --> 45:24.160
It was his choice to sit and play the game, and it was his choice to eat potato chips,

45:24.160 --> 45:30.160
his choice the types of, and then to his credit he made the decision to do something different.

45:30.160 --> 45:36.540
He decided one day to get up and eat something better, even if it was Subway, God, Togo's

45:36.540 --> 45:44.740
is so much better, but he made the decision to put some effort and take responsibility

45:44.740 --> 45:45.740
for himself.

45:45.740 --> 45:55.580
go back and blame Nintendo for his obesity? Just completely cast a big shadow over all

45:55.580 --> 45:56.580
of what he's done.

45:56.580 --> 46:00.580
At the same time though, is the gamer community taking this one little quote and blowing it

46:00.580 --> 46:01.580
completely out of context?

46:01.580 --> 46:04.900
I think it is. I think it's just a spin on the story. I'm sure it's probably something

46:04.900 --> 46:08.980
like, you know, how did you know I used to sit around playing my Nintendo. I think he

46:08.980 --> 46:12.660
was just probably trying to point out that he was lazy and eating, you know, he wasn't

46:12.660 --> 46:16.660
eating right, and someone's like, oh, he said Nintendo, oh, it's all their fault.

46:16.660 --> 46:20.060
I'm kind of seeing it a little bit like that, too. I mean, we can kind of poke fun,

46:20.060 --> 46:23.940
but in a realistic way is that, you know what, use Jared as an example that, you

46:23.940 --> 46:24.740
know, if you

46:24.740 --> 46:28.380
are feeling fat, you should put down the controller and

46:28.380 --> 46:32.260
go walk, because he said, it wasn't, he says that it's not just Subway that made him

46:32.260 --> 46:34.540
thinner, it was getting up and walking, going on walks.

46:34.540 --> 46:37.580
I need to actually quote Legend of Zaku here, because I

46:37.580 --> 46:40.700
fully believe this. I'm going to, big, happy quote for me, yeah.

46:40.700 --> 46:45.760
America, the land that personal responsibility forgot.

46:45.760 --> 46:49.600
You know, it says though, since he did

46:49.600 --> 46:54.860
was almost 425 pounds. He would have been about 600 pounds, though, if he were playing World of

46:54.860 --> 46:56.340
Warcraft instead of Nintendo.

46:56.340 --> 46:59.600
I know, just think about if they had a World of Warcraft back then. Man, he'd be...

46:59.600 --> 47:03.440
Alright, moving on. He'd be dead.

47:03.440 --> 47:07.040
So, real quick, how much

47:07.040 --> 47:10.160
gaming is too much and how can you prevent

47:10.160 --> 47:13.200
yourself from being 400 pounds overweight

47:13.200 --> 47:16.400
like Jared or whatever he wants I'm sorry I'm probably grossly over

47:16.400 --> 47:17.200
exaggerating but

47:17.200 --> 47:20.760
but how can you prevent yourself from being that overweight

47:20.760 --> 47:23.760
well I was you know I was on my way there

47:23.760 --> 47:27.420
unfortunately I moved out here from Alabama and

47:27.420 --> 47:33.360
put on something like well actually I'm now under what I was when I

47:33.360 --> 47:37.200
under what I would when I moved out here but I I did put on something like 70

47:37.200 --> 47:37.800
pounds

47:37.800 --> 47:41.680
and um, cause Dan and I are both gamers we

47:41.680 --> 47:46.120
sat around playing Street Fighter all day seriously I mean I'm not joking it was

47:46.120 --> 47:48.120
that or Castlevania Symphony of the Night

47:48.120 --> 47:51.920
and um I finally hit my saturation point

47:51.920 --> 47:55.720
in uh 2003 and said you know I can't go on this way anymore

47:55.720 --> 48:01.840
I right then and there I didn't consider it a diet I made a lifestyle change

48:01.840 --> 48:05.280
You have to incorporate little changes into your life

48:05.280 --> 48:08.800
and make them have it. Go outside the game.

48:08.800 --> 48:13.840
Exactly. What you do, and I played DDR for a while. DDR was helpful. It was exercise.

48:13.840 --> 48:15.200
It was fun and exercise.

48:15.200 --> 48:18.440
But I learned to like going to the gym. I got involved in classes.

48:18.440 --> 48:21.400
I worked out with my friends who were also. It's good to have a friend who has

48:21.400 --> 48:22.720
the same goals as you.

48:22.720 --> 48:26.000
But it's hard to really do it by yourself but

48:26.000 --> 48:31.760
the main thing to remember is that if you see that your lifestyle right now is

48:31.760 --> 48:32.980
causing you a problem

48:32.980 --> 48:36.120
you need to change your lifestyle you don't need to say oh well I'm gonna go

48:36.120 --> 48:36.920
on a diet

48:36.920 --> 48:41.280
you know lose 20 pounds and say okay my diets done I won and then gain it all back

48:41.280 --> 48:46.000
that's not how it works you know I have a really interesting observation on the

48:46.000 --> 48:46.480
whole

48:46.480 --> 48:51.480
gaming and diet thing see it was quite interesting to see before I used to play

48:51.480 --> 48:55.600
like Final Fantasy 3 and stuff you know really long RPGs and I wouldn't really

48:55.600 --> 48:59.200
you know get out and do anything then I went and played actual Qsar and that was a lot of

48:59.200 --> 49:00.040
exercise and stuff

49:00.040 --> 49:04.560
They stopped playing Qzard to play Final Fantasy 7 and 10 and stuff

49:04.560 --> 49:09.260
and I got really lazy again. Then DDR came out and I started playing a lot of DDR and that got me

49:09.260 --> 49:12.360
back to exercising. Then Final Fantasy 11 came around and I...

49:12.360 --> 49:16.440
You wanna see a trend? It's all Final Fantasy's fault.

49:16.440 --> 49:21.840
You know, along this, and I want to keep moving, but I did want to say this real quick

49:21.840 --> 49:24.040
is that, you know, DDR is a great

49:24.040 --> 49:27.240
revolution in games, but at the same time it's not the magic

49:27.240 --> 49:30.460
weight loss program. You can't just

49:30.460 --> 49:34.160
play DER and expect to drop 50 pounds.

49:34.160 --> 49:37.760
I think, kinda like Jamie said, it's gotta be a bit of a lifestyle change to it.

49:37.760 --> 49:39.720
You can't just play DDR for 15 minutes a day.

49:39.720 --> 49:43.600
It'll help and you'll get some extra, but you're not gonna really,

49:43.600 --> 49:47.920
it's not gonna be like this magic, just watch the fat fly, you know, it's

49:47.920 --> 49:52.120
different. Now if you're doing what I was doing and playing DDR for an hour, hour and a half

49:52.120 --> 49:56.380
every day, you know, after I got my, you remember when I got my long Dreamcast

49:56.380 --> 50:01.400
Back when I was playing DDR daily for an hour trying to beat the harder stuff

50:01.400 --> 50:08.320
And it was that challenging myself is what kept me going finding personal satisfaction in the competitive side of it

50:08.320 --> 50:10.960
Let me use a real-life scenario to kind of illustrate what I'm saying here

50:10.960 --> 50:16.160
We sometimes me in a group and sometimes you guys would go and what have you just depend we used to go out every Wednesday

50:16.160 --> 50:20.800
And we'd meet up at the arcade for DDR and whatever else and then after we were done

50:20.800 --> 50:24.740
we would go to Brookfield's and dine on cheese sticks and soda and

50:24.740 --> 50:28.260
and soup that's really high in fat and stuff

50:28.260 --> 50:32.100
see that's what I'm saying is that you there was no change there

50:32.100 --> 50:36.540
because you go play DDR and it's like damn that game made me hungry I'm gonna eat

50:36.540 --> 50:40.620
I'm gonna eat a whole basket of cheese sticks by myself. I actually did these

50:40.620 --> 50:42.240
way when we were doing that regularly

50:42.240 --> 50:45.780
really but you weren't ordering the same stuff were you? Well no

50:45.780 --> 50:48.680
but then again that was when I was also doing my I think I'm gonna be a

50:48.680 --> 50:50.220
vegetarian now shtick

50:50.220 --> 50:53.740
and then I went back to eating meat in 2003

50:53.740 --> 50:56.960
yeah I did the vegetarian thing for two weeks too. And now my body's

50:56.960 --> 51:00.180
forcing me into being a vegetarian, but that's just because of my antibiotics.

51:00.180 --> 51:04.200
Alright, new subject, we gotta keep it moving here. We still have a lot we want to cover here

51:04.200 --> 51:04.920
before we get a break.

51:04.920 --> 51:08.840
Starting with Kojima.

51:08.840 --> 51:12.120
You know Kojima, he's the guy that does Metal Gear. He did, John.

51:12.120 --> 51:17.240
He has this kind of podcasting going on. Those of you guys that are into the podcasting

51:17.240 --> 51:18.480
thing might get a kick outta this,

51:18.480 --> 51:23.400
is that there's actually a podcast show that he's doing and

51:23.400 --> 51:27.400
he even incorporates Solid Snake into it, which is kinda silly, but whatever.

51:27.400 --> 51:34.400
It's over on Hideo Kojima's blog, which is www.blog.konami.jp

51:34.400 --> 51:38.640
dot, I'm sorry, slash GS slash Hideo blog. You know what, just go to

51:38.640 --> 51:42.240
blog.konami.jp, you'll find it. And it's also now in English as well.

51:42.240 --> 51:46.180
You can find his own podcast show, and it's called

51:46.180 --> 51:49.680
HIDECAN RADIO, okay? But it's not in English,

51:49.680 --> 51:54.220
Okay, so you have to kind of understand at least a little bit of Japanese unless you just want to listen to like

51:54.600 --> 51:59.560
Japanese talk like if you're an anime and you just like listening to sexy Japanese talking or whatever you might get a kick out of

51:59.560 --> 52:01.560
This it's a good educational tool. That's true

52:02.000 --> 52:05.040
Yeah, oh, man. I was gonna go in real life story. We don't have time

52:05.040 --> 52:09.200
I was gonna talk about Telemundo and in Spanish, but that's right because I love me some tell me

52:10.720 --> 52:12.720
Anyway, um

52:13.640 --> 52:18.060
Let's change stories now check it out if you like radio and and Kojima

52:18.060 --> 52:21.460
What's going on with Video Games Live?

52:21.460 --> 52:25.220
That tour kind of comes and goes and comes and goes.

52:25.220 --> 52:26.420
What is it doing now, Jamie?

52:26.420 --> 52:27.420
Is it coming or going?

52:27.420 --> 52:31.860
It's actually closing the Game Developers Conference in San Jose.

52:31.860 --> 52:36.820
Basically, it's just going to be Video Games Live concert featuring performances of music

52:36.820 --> 52:39.660
from various classic game titles.

52:39.660 --> 52:45.340
It's going to be on Friday, March 24th and performed by the Symphony Silicon Valley Orchestra

52:45.340 --> 52:51.760
and it's full chorus and so we have the pong music again it says among the games

52:51.760 --> 52:57.120
to be highlighted we have Mario, Zelda, Halo, Metal Gear Solid, Warcraft, Myst,

52:57.120 --> 53:02.000
Castlevania, Medal of Honor, Sonic, Kingdom Hearts, and Final Fantasy along

53:02.000 --> 53:08.060
with a retro classic arcade medley featuring over 20 games all right sounds

53:08.060 --> 53:11.980
good get your tickets soon it's gonna sell out all right now we're gonna move

53:11.980 --> 53:16.180
on to another topic this one's kind of a long topic and the chat rooms actually

53:16.180 --> 53:19.060
been asking about this like all night long when we're gonna get to this so

53:19.060 --> 53:24.880
here we go you guys probably heard earlier this week there was a gamer out

53:24.880 --> 53:31.260
there who took his own life and it was he was a member of this forum well and

53:31.260 --> 53:34.300
it which was what a Metal Gear Solid forum if I remember unfortunately here's

53:34.300 --> 53:38.620
the thing the media kind of tied a knot of this story and I'm even looking at

53:38.620 --> 53:44.820
this article that Kotaku ran on it that really was trying to kind of sort things out about

53:44.820 --> 53:46.260
what the media misreported.

53:46.260 --> 53:49.620
I think the media said it was a Bulgarian website at some point or something.

53:49.620 --> 53:50.860
It was crazy.

53:50.860 --> 53:56.160
And certainly, we don't want to make light of this tragic event and it's very sad that

53:56.160 --> 53:58.140
somebody decided to take their own life.

53:58.140 --> 54:05.520
But unfortunately, now it's kind of as these types of tragic events tend to make happen

54:05.520 --> 54:08.960
is that activism comes out in many, many different ways.

54:08.960 --> 54:10.100
There's types of activism.

54:10.100 --> 54:14.300
There's good activism, and there's bad activism, and we're going to talk about both those types

54:14.300 --> 54:16.160
of activism that have been going on.

54:16.160 --> 54:21.160
So let me kind of start with this, is the article on Kotaku that they were kind of reprinting

54:21.160 --> 54:28.160
something that was posted by, I want to say, Tim Rogers, talking about kind of the misrepresentation

54:28.160 --> 54:29.160
of the AFP story.

54:29.160 --> 54:31.840
I'm going to read little blips of this here.

54:31.840 --> 54:33.600
I'm going to get political with you for a moment.

54:33.600 --> 54:38.020
Our website, run by some people I respect, metalgearsolid.org, has been shut down by

54:38.020 --> 54:44.200
a government agency following an AFP Newswire story reported on Yahoo News and CNN about

54:44.200 --> 54:49.500
how a member of their forums broadcasted his suicide via webcam as other forum members

54:49.500 --> 54:50.500
egged him on.

54:50.500 --> 54:53.600
Apparently, it was big news for a few moments over in America.

54:53.600 --> 54:55.840
The worst thing is it's not true.

54:55.840 --> 55:00.200
For one thing, the forum member who did in fact commit suicide did not broadcast his

55:00.200 --> 55:01.200
death.

55:01.200 --> 55:05.520
Moreover, the forum members tried with all their might to take him down.

55:05.520 --> 55:10.180
What can you do is contact the AFP wire organization, tell them that you think this is horrible,

55:10.180 --> 55:13.740
that they should fire the reporter responsible for these bizarrely malicious lies, and then

55:13.740 --> 55:15.600
apologize as widely as possible.

55:15.600 --> 55:18.320
If you want to read the whole thing, that was originally published over on insert credit,

55:18.320 --> 55:21.880
but it also ran on Kotaku, which is where I first saw it.

55:21.880 --> 55:28.280
So now we get to good activism and bad activism, and it relates to somebody that is quite the

55:28.280 --> 55:32.900
activist in the gaming scene and everyone's I'm just turning it over to

55:32.900 --> 55:40.760
Jamie everyone's favorite asshole sorry Jack Thompson I'm not going to mince my

55:40.760 --> 55:45.940
words on this I'm going to say exactly how I feel and before he decides to come

55:45.940 --> 55:55.340
after us and say these are my opinions of you I am exercising my first amendment

55:55.340 --> 56:03.000
right you asshole Jack Thompson is a leech he is nothing but a parasite he

56:03.000 --> 56:06.420
cares nothing about the person that committed suicide he cares nothing about

56:06.420 --> 56:09.000
the family he cares nothing about the families of the people involved in his

56:09.000 --> 56:14.660
cases he's working on he is using their pain and suffering to be a leech and use

56:14.660 --> 56:19.880
it to further his goal of notoriety and to fill his pocketbook that is all he is

56:19.880 --> 56:23.740
after he cares nothing about those families and of course is using the

56:23.740 --> 56:28.780
gaming community by basically publicly defaming the entire community and what

56:28.780 --> 56:34.460
did he do to demonstrate this to you this week it had to do with the basically

56:34.460 --> 56:40.180
the letters and posts he was doing regarding the suicide that went on

56:40.180 --> 56:45.580
basically and on top of that I find this exactly hilarious he was trying to use

56:45.580 --> 56:51.340
the Bible to support and he's a lawyer he should know something like that would

56:51.340 --> 56:54.340
not hold up in court excuse me no a devil's advocate for just a minute

56:54.340 --> 56:57.100
because I'm curious here how do we know it's really him because these are being

56:57.100 --> 57:00.620
done through anonymous posts on the game's politics website or sorry game

57:00.620 --> 57:05.120
politics website right how do we know it's really him could it just be somebody

57:05.120 --> 57:10.780
trying to raise of IP hmm also every other thing that I've ever read by him

57:10.780 --> 57:17.060
it very much fits how he writes and I've gotten good at that because I've had to

57:17.060 --> 57:20.980
hunt down impersonators and things before so you know I heard I read on one

57:20.980 --> 57:25.240
these sites. You linked me the other night to somebody's one-up blog that had compiled

57:25.240 --> 57:30.720
a lot of these posts together, which I thought was pretty well done, and I think they actually

57:30.720 --> 57:35.140
posted in there some type of letter that Jack Thompson had tried to send to the folks in

57:35.140 --> 57:44.140
Pennsylvania against gamepolitics.com, Gamepolitics.com is one of the most intelligent websites, and

57:44.140 --> 57:46.680
I'm not just saying this because I've talked to the guy that runs it, he's a really nice

57:46.680 --> 57:53.260
it really is one of the most intelligent websites out there about gaming and I think is like the I

57:54.000 --> 57:58.780
Think it's like definitive of how gamers can be very intelligent people

57:58.780 --> 58:02.940
I think this website stands up for that and when I see Jack Thompson attacking that it makes me go

58:02.940 --> 58:05.160
He's threatened by that. He's threatened by that

58:06.340 --> 58:07.740
good

58:07.740 --> 58:11.220
Upstanding, you know gamers doing you know smart intelligent things

58:11.220 --> 58:17.060
he called playing video games a masturbatory activity as in senseless

58:17.060 --> 58:20.780
self stimulation you know maybe if he had some stimulation he wouldn't be so

58:20.780 --> 58:25.820
anal retentive that he spews shit every time he opens his mouth sorry I said I

58:25.820 --> 58:29.660
wasn't gonna mince my words that's how exactly how I feel all right okay I'm

58:29.660 --> 58:32.860
gonna I'm gonna be a girl now we're gonna have to explicit tag this show

58:32.860 --> 58:38.060
that's all right usually that gets more listeners anyway yay press no but

58:38.060 --> 58:41.420
I apologize for my... That was very Jack Thompson of you.

58:41.420 --> 58:44.980
Just teasing. But seriously though,

58:44.980 --> 58:48.220
and this, I get the emails on it,

58:48.220 --> 58:51.620
I hear about it, and it's just,

58:51.620 --> 58:55.500
I hit my saturation point. I'm like, okay, someone,

58:55.500 --> 59:00.100
he needs to just go away. And, you know, I'm always one that

59:00.100 --> 59:03.140
believes if you ignore the problem, you know,

59:03.140 --> 59:07.420
it doesn't necessarily go away. It might get worse. You know, things don't change

59:07.420 --> 59:09.560
until you make them change, right?

59:09.560 --> 59:12.720
Someone seriously, if he's gonna be all up in arms

59:12.720 --> 59:14.460
defaming the community, I think the community

59:14.460 --> 59:17.300
needs to take some steps to defend itself.

59:17.300 --> 59:18.940
Well, can I share one interesting way

59:18.940 --> 59:20.780
that the community has decided to defend itself?

59:20.780 --> 59:21.620
Absolutely.

59:21.620 --> 59:23.300
All right, I thought this was very interesting.

59:23.300 --> 59:24.860
There's actually this website going on,

59:24.860 --> 59:27.240
and it's actually a LiveJournal community,

59:27.240 --> 59:29.180
and it's called Flowers for Jack,

59:29.180 --> 59:30.540
and you can access this website.

59:30.540 --> 59:34.860
It's flowersforjack.livejournal.com, okay?

59:34.860 --> 59:40.000
They've just updated, actually as of the time we're recording this, they've just reached

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
the $70 mark.

59:42.000 --> 59:43.220
What are they doing here?

59:43.220 --> 59:48.340
They are trying to raise money to buy flowers for Jack Thompson.

59:48.340 --> 59:51.200
Now why the hell would you want to buy flowers for Jack Thompson?

59:51.200 --> 59:52.200
This is why.

59:52.200 --> 59:57.720
I quote from this article, my point is simple, gamers everywhere write him hate mail, send

59:57.720 --> 01:00:00.100
him threats, call him at all hours of the night.

01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:02.260
This is not constructive.

01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:04.740
This only makes us into what he says we are.

01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:09.280
We are to the point that he will disregard any correspondence at the very least, threaten

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:10.800
it legally at the most.

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:15.080
It's hard to get his attention for real, I propose we write him a stern, dignified letter

01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:19.520
free of insults, exaggerations, or unfounded complaints and state the most honest and reasonable

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:20.840
case we can.

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:24.560
Most importantly, it will be sent with as many bouquets of beautiful pink roses as I

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:26.880
can possibly send to his office.

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:27.880
Love it.

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:28.880
Love it.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:29.880
You should totally do that.

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:32.160
We're gonna, we're gonna send $20 on behalf of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:33.160
We are contributing to this.

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:34.160
We are gonna contribute to the flowers for Jack Conroy.

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.760
He's going to call it an act of terrorism.

01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:39.320
Flowers, an act of terrorism, come on.

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:40.320
Come on.

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:46.480
And for all those people that I'm reading that say, you know, kill him, do that, no.

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:47.480
That's not constructive.

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:49.120
That's exactly what these guys are saying you should not do.

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:53.840
But my other point to that, to maybe convince people that that's not the best course of

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:54.840
action?

01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:55.840
Martyr.

01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:58.520
Remember what happened to our last major martyr, right?

01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:01.520
We now have rampant Christianity everywhere.

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:11.680
Now listen, this is the same guy who considered a donation in his name of $10,000 as a defamation

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:12.680
of character.

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:15.760
I mean, it's pretty retarded.

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:19.680
I did also find it funny that one of the things I read, you know how he's bringing out that

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:24.000
had this person known the love of Jesus Christ, they wouldn't have done that.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:30.800
He was basically shot down by a minister, by a Protestant pastor.

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:37.680
This kind of brings me to another point and I get really nervous when we get into the

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:43.420
religious talk on the show and I'm not a very religious person myself but there are certain

01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:46.200
types of religious people I have a lot of respect for.

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:50.020
I have a really, really good friend of mine at work who is a deeply religious person but

01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:54.860
I value him totally as a friend and I really respect him and his beliefs and stuff because

01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:58.240
they are his beliefs and I think that's great.

01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:03.340
I love it when I see these really intelligent Christian rebuttals, and there's one of them

01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:08.280
that actually was posted to Game Politics, the same thing here, they actually got a letter

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:12.740
from one of their readers, David Savage, and I thought it was great.

01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:15.580
I don't know how much of this I really want to read, you should just go read it for yourself

01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:17.580
over on GamePolitics.com.

01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:21.780
I am a Christian, non-denominational, yet I am also the first person to admit that enforcing

01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:25.820
religious opinion as a way of censorship in video games is asinine.

01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:29.340
face facts video games are fiction just like books movies and television however

01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:33.300
it seems as if pundits lawyers and media mongers have been using my religion as a

01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:37.900
meat shield for their ignorant attacks on video games very interesting and it

01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:41.780
kind of goes on to these things I'm not going to read the whole thing is

01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:44.940
running a long time but just go check it out for yourself game politics calm very

01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:51.180
very well written loved it Wow anything else we want to say on this I'm not

01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:55.020
going to be running for president anytime soon chat room sorry lots of

01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:57.320
heated response from the chat room there.

01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:01.240
I'm sure they're just dying to get in on the Skyline, which we'll do after the break in

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:02.280
a little bit.

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:06.740
Somebody saying here, an interesting comment from Wonder Dog Harold, I'd rather send money

01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:10.420
to a charity rather than flowers for Jack Thompson.

01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:11.740
That is a good point.

01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:15.880
That is a very good point, and we do also donate to charity once in a while, too.

01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:20.980
We did the big Sacramento Independent Audio for Katrina Relief thing a while ago, which

01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:22.940
was a good success.

01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:28.160
So we do that stuff too, but we support causes that we want to back, and this is definitely

01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:33.340
one of those causes that we think ought to deserve a little support and a little airtime

01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:34.340
and a little money.

01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:35.340
Just a little money.

01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:36.340
We're not sending them a lot.

01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:37.340
Twenty bucks isn't a lot.

01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:38.340
So, anyway.

01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:42.800
Anything else you want to say on that?

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:43.800
We good?

01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:44.800
Loki, you're awfully quiet.

01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:45.800
All things considered.

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:46.800
Doug Tate.

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:51.880
Jack, he had that thing that came out last weekend about wanting to recall all these

01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:56.060
games that are coming out in 25 to life and all these violent murder simulators

01:03:56.060 --> 01:04:01.000
as he said he's right you know we do have too many murder simulators out

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.620
there why we need more sex simulators that's what I'm hoping for

01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:11.500
rockstar if you're listening get on it hot coffee the game all right we got one

01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:14.940
more segment to do before we go to break here and it just seemed like I don't

01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:17.800
know why but it seemed like an inappropriate time to get into this

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:23.960
segment, maybe it's just me, but it's time to bring on the anger in the FUs of the week.

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:39.080
Dark soccer, what's ticking you off this week? Well, I think I actually just ranted myself out

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:46.760
on the biggest thing that was pissing me off this week, so instead of going off on ye olde

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:50.520
butt head again. I'm going to have to say that my biggest

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:55.240
nephew of the week goes toward um waiting to the last

01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:59.320
minute to get things done. In this case I blame myself because I

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:02.760
waited to the last minute to check my tire so now I have a flat.

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:09.320
Oops! But it's- I see so many- I have to deal with this so often in my

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:14.120
daily work. People going oh I didn't do it or oh I

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:18.520
I forgot or this it goes back to this thing called personal responsibility, right?

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:27.500
It's personal responsibility. I think people not accounting for it not having it is what is contributing to the downfall of this country

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:32.320
You see it in little things every day. You see it on a wide scale like with our

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:39.700
Not so good friend. Mr. Thompson who is playing games instead of individual people for their own actions, right?

01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:45.700
we see it ourselves with oh well I can just do this later or with oh but I was

01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:52.020
busy doing this if people said you know I admit I was wrong let me maybe let me

01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:57.340
do this if people would just stop and admit hey you need to do this or I

01:05:57.340 --> 01:06:03.380
didn't do it or here it's done right on time I think that would all be better

01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:09.260
off it's a sign of responsibility you know the moment you admit that you broke

01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:13.340
the glasses the day you're supposed to be an adult right instead of blaming the dog

01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:23.260
all right loki my f-u of the week is going to mcdonald's mainly though it's not mcdonald's

01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:28.780
fault i'm blaming vegetarians and fat people for making mcdonald's food taste like crap

01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:33.420
here's the reason why before the vegetarians attacked mcdonald's for adding their meat

01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:38.060
flavoring to their fries their fries kick ass then they came in fries tastes

01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:42.820
like crap now and they can't freaking cook them for damn the other thing is

01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:47.500
also they've tried to make these more healthy choices on their menus no need

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:51.820
the food was good before you had to go and fuck with it listen if you don't

01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:56.380
want to eat that crap don't attack my food god damn it I love supersize I love

01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:59.780
the amount of soda that I got there in the amount of fries I was happy with

01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:33.860
log on there at like 10.01 and all the good seats are gone. Oh, because all the good seats

01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:38.820
go to contest winners and, and, and, uh, you know, industry people and people that don't

01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:42.300
deserve to be in the front row. I deserve to be in the front row. Horrible. So I don't

01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:48.780
like the way ticketing is done, so F you to that.

01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:54.260
Which, none of those really had a lot to do with games. Good job. Alright. That's alright.

01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:57.660
Anyway, we are now going to take this opportunity. Oh no, one more thing. One more thing. Oh,

01:07:57.660 --> 01:07:58.660
How can I forget this?

01:07:58.660 --> 01:07:59.780
This is very important.

01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:05.380
A new segment, a brand new segment we've got to do, and this is great too.

01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:06.840
I love this segment.

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:08.900
You know what time it is?

01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:12.740
No, it's not Dark Sakura's advice column.

01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:18.200
Sorry, that is still gone, but Dark Sakura, instead of scouring the world for good advice

01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:23.500
to bring you, she is scouring the internet for websites that need your immediate attention.

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:27.180
So we're now bringing you Dark Sakura's Website of the Week.

01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:34.180
Today's website is stuffomycat.com. It is the most adorable site in existence.

01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:40.180
In fact, today's little bit of love on this features a picture of a cat fighting Godzilla.

01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:48.180
It's adorable. But basically, the whole premise of this site is people actually just putting things on the cat, sending a picture.

01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:52.180
Now, please don't hurt your cat if you're going to do this, because that's animal cruelty and that's not cool.

01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:56.180
Some of these cats just look anywhere from amused to vaguely annoyed.

01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:57.680
Some of them are game related though, right?

01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:01.180
Oh yeah, well, this one has wrestling figures sitting on the cat.

01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:05.180
And there was another one, this one has an Xbox 360 laying on a cat.

01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:07.180
The cat just looks irritated.

01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:10.680
Another one has cats wearing clothing, cats with DVDs on them,

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:15.180
cats with alien facehuggers, stuffed alien facehuggers on them.

01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:19.180
And there were also different, you know, anime stuff.

01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:22.180
This one has a bunch of trash on the cat, and some of them have cats with ear.

01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:25.180
Now, some people have said that StuffOnMyCat.com,

01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:28.460
I know we're gonna get this feedback has already been featured in a lot of different places

01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:29.500
I'm gonna be honest with you

01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:36.260
I did not hear about stuff on my cap calm until this week when get this on the exact same day the exact same day

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:41.260
One of my co-workers and Jamie both pointed this side out to me in the same day

01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:45.260
I thought that was really weird like how word travels like that. So it was new to me

01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:48.220
I randomly check stuff on my cat quite often

01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:56.100
You know, there's one with naked Barbies on it another one just with a giant bag on it. I think it's adorable

01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:58.540
I love stuff on my cat calm my feet

01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:03.260
Know that's wrong. I was gonna say my favorite is the one where I saw and you know

01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:08.780
Someone's SUV back rear tire on top of a cab, but you know, hey

01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:14.140
All right. I think though that we should there should be my cat on stuff calm. I

01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:20.300
I looked for them, no one did it yet. I found the picture with the

01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:23.860
cat covered in Game Boys, so I'm linking that to the chat room.

01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:28.140
That's why my co-workers showed me. You know what this all is. This is just the US version of Oolong.

01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:31.220
In a way. You know Oolong's on Wikipedia now.

01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:34.660
Yes, I linked that to you too. And so is you being, but

01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:38.020
Oolong's dead. And we're on Wikipedia, Orange Long Radio. That's like,

01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:41.940
that's when some of my friends told me, dude, Rob, you guys really are famous.

01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:43.020
You're on Wikipedia.

01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:43.860
I'm like, come on.

01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:46.300
We do this show out of the spare bedroom in my apartment.

01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:48.100
We're not famous yet, but we are on Wikipedia,

01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:49.980
which is all kinds of cool, so.

01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:52.980
We're internet celebrities, yo.

01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:54.520
Take that however you want.

01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:55.620
All right, we're gonna go to a break.

01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:56.840
When we come back from the break,

01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:01.840
Loki's gonna bring us a whole buttload of Xbox 360 stuff,

01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:06.940
and we're gonna do the worst-reviewed games of all time

01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:09.700
and lots of stuff coming up after the break.

01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:12.620
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights,

01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:14.900

01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:19.480
