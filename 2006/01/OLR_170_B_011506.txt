And now, the conclusion of episode 170 for January 15, 2006.
I thought we were talking about Oregon Trail the MMO
Dance Dance Revolution Supernova
It was announced on DDRFreak.com this week.
Betson Enterprises is distributing it, although it's assumed that Konami is actually making the game.
We don't know a lot outside of that, except for a logo that was also posted on DDRFreak in the forums, a little red and black looking logo.
Should be very interesting.
I should also point out, most of the previous arcade versions of DDR that you've played were actually quote-unquote illegal machines from Japan.
And DDR shouldn't be confused with the other arcade dancing game in the groove.
That's a whole other story.
But we haven't had a US release in the arcades of a DDR game since DDR USA Mix, which was like...
I want to say 98, 99?
It was a long time ago.
So this one is being made in the U.S.
It's not being made for Japanese release, or we don't really know the full specifics on that, but we do know it's definitely coming out for USA.
What do you guys think?
As longtime DDR fans, because I know y'all are, because Orange Sons Radio started as kind of a music game station, what do you think?
Loki, is this something you're excited about?
It took them a long time to start over, I guess, but it should be interesting.
Might get me back in the plane again.
I just have to see how it is, because it could suck.
That's the whole thing.
It's gotta be, they've got a second chance to do something right, and they better not screw it up.
DarkSakura?
My sentiments, exactly, except I've just been sort of like, oh, DDR.
Is it too late to save you, to bring you back into the DDR loop?
Well, no, when it's out, I'll be excited, but right now, because I don't know anything about it, and I just like,
I'm hoping it's not too little too late.
It's got to be something impressive for me to be really excited about it, honestly.
I'm having good feelings about this.
I think they're going to do a good job.
The home mixes recently have been pretty good.
There's been lots of improvements, but I think Konami's kind of in tune with their fan base to an extent.
It depends which game we're talking about.
But I'm hopeful.
I'm hopeful that they'll come out with a large catalog of stuff.
I'm assuming they're going to port stuff over from the home mixes and mix it with some new stuff.
So I think it'll be a fun arcade thing.
I'm just looking forward to getting back and going to the arcading groups.
The one thing I'm really hoping to get out of this is more diversity in the music.
That would be cool.
More diversity, not just the same... Oh, it's Danzy.
But I think the US mixes have done it, especially like Ultra Mix 3.
Oh yeah, that's a step in the right direction.
I think so, but... I don't know.
And this is just how I am anyway.
I try to reserve judgment until I actually see it.
Right.
All right.
Make Latav's here, by the way.
I know he hasn't said anything yet.
Probably because he can't, because he's afraid.
He actually works at Konami, but obviously can't say a word about this.
Or can you?
No, not really, but I can say that it sounds pretty awesome from the stuff I do know.
So, thumbs up.
Look out for it.
And you know what the best part is, though?
What?
That it's being distributed by Betsyn, so that means Dave and Busters can get it.
So, you've got Pump Zero coming out really soon, and then
Such and such time for Supernova, and when they're both there, you know what that means?
No lines on Pump Zero for me.
Is that a conflict of interest, the fact that you like Pump It Up so much yet?
No, everybody knows I like Pump It Up more than life, so... Alright, Pump It Up, of course, for those that don't know, is the Korean...
Dance Game Dance Game Dance Game Dance Game Dance Game
Yay, New York!
We wave our little flag.
We are opening up the Skype line for the first time on our podcast.
You can either go to OrangeLoungeRadio.com and click on Interact With Us, or you can actually give us a call as well, 916-226-9067.
But please be aware that could be a toll call depending on where you're at.
So ask Mommy and Daddy before you do that.
All right, let's go to the phones.
Who's going to be our very first caller?
I don't know.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Are you there?
Yes.
Yes, who is this?
Xander from Florida.
Hi, Xander from Florida.
What's on your mind?
Am I the first call?
He's breaking up a little bit there.
Am I the first call?
Yes, you are the first call, but you're breaking up pretty bad there.
What's on your mind?
Gosh, I'm sorry about the breaking up thing.
That's all right.
Breaking up is hard to do.
Yeah, I wanted to talk about the DDR thing, of course.
All right.
What's on your mind about the DDR thing?
Here's what I think.
If it's going to work, in some way they're going to have to cater to the Indie Groove audience.
Like it or not, there are going to be a lot of very upset people if Indie Groove dies and this game doesn't have at least 11s, if not 12s.
So, as an In The Groove fan, which I know in previous calls to this show you've said that you are, what are you looking for Konami to do to please the In The Groove fanbase?
Are you saying more difficult 11s and 12s or what?
More 9s and more 10s and maybe add 11s, possibly 12s, but I don't think they'd do that.
I mean, I'd be kind of shocked if they had 12s.
So is it just a difficulty thing for you or is there more to it?
It's mostly...
I don't see why Konami has to cater to the In The Groove audience They left them, they abandoned them We don't want them back!
Like, you know, go play your game that has music that sounds the same through every song and that has steps that are ridiculously hard.
If that's what you find fun, go play in the groove.
If you want music that sounds pretty decent and, you know, might not be super hard for you, go play DDR.
Listen, I'm going to come back here, shockingly, on the middle ground here.
Now... Shh!
Quiet!
Anyways...
What I was basically going to say is Konami, what they want to do with especially a lot of these music games, they want to cater to everybody, obviously.
So that means not too easy, not too hard type of stuff.
Remember, folks, there's always edit steps.
You always have your edits that you can put on the machines or you can make yourself.
That could be any size difficulty.
Yeah, but how many people actually do that?
Not enough.
I used to when we had a fourth mix because God knows some of those songs were just craptastic.
Yeah.
Remember the old Hell edits?
Yeah, those ones are fun.
I made it all jump rock beat.
That was so much fun.
I don't know that I knew you then.
I used to make these insanely hard edits and then would challenge people and if they could beat them with a decent score, I'd buy them dinner.
Oh, that's pretty cool.
Alright, I want to keep it moving tonight with the calls, but I definitely want to give Xander a chance to say his piece.
So, Xander?
Well, okay, I think they do need to cater to the group because
I don't know, there's just going to be a lot of very angry people.
They killed Groove with the stupid lawnmower.
I mean, it really, if they're going to have a monopoly on the dance games, then they need to cater to everybody.
Not just a misdemeanor that can't get on one-footers.
They are catering to everybody.
All difficulty levels.
from coming out, which is what is assumably intended with this lawsuit, then shouldn't they, if they're going to stomp out in the groove, so to speak, and no pun intended, shouldn't they put elements that make in the groove so loved in their game?
That's what I'm hearing here.
Elements are in the groove, so they've got to steal someone else's intellectual copy.
Oh, stop it.
Stop it.
All right.
Xander, I want to give you a chance, though, for final words here.
Okay.
That's about it.
All right.
Thanks for your call, Sandra.
Appreciate it.
It's actually one thing that did occur to me, though, that would completely eliminate this whole 10-11 crap.
Start grading it like they do Guitar Freaks.
With the numbers going up to 100 and stuff like that?
Yeah.
That would be pretty cool, actually.
So that you have more of a broad scale to judge the difficulty by.
But then it brings up the point, like with Neon FM, when it was coming out, you've got a 55 and a 56.
What's the difference between those two numbers?
Maybe you have like a trill somewhere in the middle of the song.
That would be interesting though if Konami said, you know what, screw this whole 10, 11, 12 business.
We'll just do a whole new rating system and F this thing.
I guess we'll see pretty soon.
They did try that once with the gauges, but the gauges were retarded.
I think this whole scale needs to be implemented.
Hi, this is Tony from Washington I wanted to give my opinion of a new DS game
Oh, sure, what's up?
It's called Trace Memory in the US or another code in the UK.
It's a great game.
What do you think about Trace Memory?
It is interesting.
What is the point of Trace Memory?
Because I haven't really played this game a whole lot, so what exactly do you do in Trace Memory?
Basically, you're this girl who, on the day before her 14th birthday, finds out that her
Finds out that her dad is alive.
Finds out that her dad is alive.
My friends, you're breaking up here a little bit, so it's really hard to understand you here.
But I'm going to throw it back to the studio and talk a little bit here about Trace Memory.
And I appreciate you bringing it up here.
So what do you guys think about Trace Memory?
I really played it.
I did a review on that one about three months ago.
Yeah?
I don't remember.
It was the one that had puzzle elements where you walk up through a village, up through a house, and try to put the whole thing together.
And I was really, really interested in it.
I haven't picked it up yet, just my schedule is not allowed for it.
But it was one that I was actually really interested in playing, and I've heard nothing but good about it.
I did play all the way through it.
The only problem with it was that it was really short.
I felt there was really nothing...
that would bring me back to it once I beat it.
It did have a lot of really cool things with the DS, like opening the DS partway so you could see the reflection off both screens to solve a puzzle.
That was cool.
But I don't know, it was a pretty good game.
I wish it was at least four hours longer, though.
All right, let's go ahead and go back to the Skype line.
Again, you can give us a call over the phone as well, 916-226-9067.
Or you can call us on username OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.
Let's go to the phones.
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Hi, Sephiroth1215 here.
Hi, Sephiroth1215.
What's on your mind?
A bunch of things.
First of all, about the new DDR coming out.
I mean, I was really excited when I first heard it.
I mean, I...
How to make sure, like, alright, how close are we to April Fools?
Because that's happened before anyway.
That was the resounding reaction of DDR Freak.
And I'm like, come on, people.
They're not that cruel over there.
Especially about something like this.
This is something you don't joke about.
Well, we are that cruel, but we don't joke about that.
As we remember the big everybody is now an admin thing that went on.
Otherwise, I didn't
I'm curious about this.
I mean, I'm sure it's going to be a big step, but it could also be bad.
We never know.
It could be just another bad mix.
I'm kind of hoping.
Not that anyway, but... It's really hard to judge the game until we see at least like a screenshot or know something else about it.
So everything you hear is all assumptions at this point.
Everything.
They could change the foundation of the game for all we know.
Now, here's my only concern is remember the last arcade game to come out and, you know, this is
Not one that's really talked about a lot, but Dancing Stage Fusion in the UK, another arcade release that was supposed to be, oh, it's on brand new hardware.
It was just a port of the game to the arcade.
It was, like, crap.
This will not be the case for this game.
From what I know, which, you know, I can't say what I do know, but you shouldn't worry that much at this point.
Alright, fair enough.
Alright, anything else you want to share with us, Sibroth?
Oh, yeah, this... I mean, obviously there's going to be a lot of
Um, controversy, or maybe a little war in the group now in DDR, but whatever, I don't really care.
I mean, I'm still going to play both of them, but I've been wondering about the memory card slots or whatever they're going to do for that, because I'm thinking, like, if they use PS2 memory cards, then they have to license to use them, or to use Magic Gate, so I'm not sure about that.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Oh my god.
Oh my god, oh my god, who's this?
This is Tomo-kun.
Oh hey, it's my fanboy.
What's up Tomo-kun, what's on your mind?
Wait, I don't believe this.
I was actually just going to say something about that Xbox 360 thing and the DirecTV thing.
Yeah, you actually messaged me something in the chatroom about the whole DirecTV Xbox 360 thing.
What's going on with this?
I think it's a joke, personally, because...
This is not just Xbox 360.
They're going to make it a Windows Media Extender.
And also, what I don't like is that during this, they dropped the TiVo line.
So everyone, including me, and I have one of these, has to have the R15, which is also just a piece of crap.
Hmm.
Very interesting point.
You're right there.
How far is Microsoft going to go to support the whole Mac thing?
But, okay, interesting.
Well, I... What?
What?
Yeah, and it's a game console.
It doesn't have to be your whole media center.
It really sounds like we're slipping into the realm of video game corporate politics.
You know, more of another...
tool to put one under the other, you know, is what it sounds like to me.
Well, and it's interesting because Tomokun's saying, you know, why not just stick with the games, what you know, and why get into all this other stuff, you know, with the media center.
But I think that's kind of where the next generation of gaming is really going, especially as, you know, games get more and more realistic and the internet, it's becoming, you know, one big centerpiece in your living room, so to speak.
I do have to say that
Dan sits for like an hour pulling my MP3s off my computer through the Xbox just listening to stuff in the living room when I'm in the other room.
All I can say is thank goodness for Nintendo keeping us with just games and not all this extra crap.
Amen.
So far.
Alright, Tomokuni.
Oh, yeah?
What?
I was going to say, anything else you want to share with us?
Yeah, I just...
I was going to say, I don't think that's going to be executed well enough because if anyone's used one of the new boxes, like me, it's horrible to use.
It'll probably kill your Xbox.
Well, we'll see.
We'll see.
All right.
Well, thanks so much for calling in, Tomokun.
Appreciate it.
Thanks.
Have a good one.
And with some of those Xboxes, you can sneeze on them and it'll kill them.
Yeah, it's kind of a... B.S.O.D.
All right.
All right.
Well, thank you guys for calling in.
We'll open up the Skype line a little later if we have some more time, but I don't know because we're kind of running over tonight.
We'll see.
For now, though, let's talk about Xbox 360.
Loki, one of the surprise hits of Xbox 360 is not something that's on store shelves.
It's Geometry Wars.
Yep, Geometry Wars Retro Evolved has actually been downloaded at least the trial's been downloaded over 200,000 times and they've sold 45,000 copies of the game, which is
and many more.
Somebody asked me not that long ago, why is it that you're so desperate to get your hands on an Xbox 360?
I'm like, Geometry Wars and Smash TV co-op?
It's cool!
It's really a good thing that they're doing.
A lot more stuff.
I know that one of the other titles that they're talking about coming to Xbox Live's arcade is like Worms, the classic Worms, and they're going to have Street Fighter 2, of course.
So lots of stuff coming to it.
I don't like that, but still, it's a really good concept that they have there, and I think you're going to see a lot of people trying to copy it.
All right.
Now, we always invite your feedback, and so that means we can open up the Skype line sometimes, or sometimes we're watching our chatroom at orangelaunchradio.com.
Sometimes we're reading the mail.
It's a great way for those of you guys that are listening to our podcast form of the show to interact with us.
Now, just a footnote, we are going to be changing the email address this week.
Even if you're still using ToGo, we'll put a forwarder in so it still works.
But since the Orange Launch Radio ToGo edition doesn't really exist anymore, the new email address will be mailbag.com.
at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
So if you want to send us an email, it's mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
But it still all works the same.
DarkSakura gets her hand in there, digs in deep, and pulls out the mail.
So DarkSakura, what's in the mailbag?
You make that sound so dirty.
Oh my.
I have to make sure people are paying attention.
Well, just to go ahead and make a quick disclaimer, by the way, the email that we receive has now tripled in the past two weeks on average.
So I apologize if I don't get to read everybody's email that is sent to me.
I do read it, and I try to reply to as many of them as possible.
I try to get in there and read it too, but I honestly don't always.
If somebody has something they have to share with me, you can find my email address on the site, but filter through Jamie because that's her thing.
Well, this one comes from Chupa Thingy.
I'm sorry, I still love that.
Is that like those old lollipops?
Chupa Chupa?
Wait a minute.
Red versus blue.
That's right.
I had this exact same conversation two weeks ago.
We'll call it Chupa Thingy.
All right.
What's up?
Puma.
But I got a response email where he's thanking us for saying that he is absolutely awesome and cool for having my little pony killer.
Oh, okay.
Now that I remember.
Yeah.
Basically, just to give this to one server, he says, Firstly, let me say that I don't understand why the IRA cares about transactions and MMOs.
It would be just like taxing PlayMoney transactions.
I guess it would be like taxing Monopoly money.
Yeah, I bought BoardWalk.
I better send George $20.
Here's one paper dollar.
Sure, the PlayMoney has market value, but who cares?
Secondly, about the external Xbox 360 HDDVDVDV.
Drive.
Maybe we will be seeing some third-party peripherals like that so the crappy Microsoft versions would not be able to dominate the market.
Can you say third-party hard drives?
Also, let me say that I am the first person in all the state of Montana to pre-order the Snoopy game.
Rock!
You are hardcore, my friend.
Sadly, I will probably not be the last as well.
With the release of Street Fighter 2 over the Xbox Live Marketplace, do you think that this will be the start of classic Capcom re-releases?
Personally, I would love to play high-def versions of 8-bit Mega Man games on my 360.
Lastly, what is the deal with the name of the Bandai Namco merged company?
I would have expected something more along the lines of Banco or Namdai or some original name.
I like Banco.
Banco.
Banco!
I kind of like Namdai.
You cannot handle the Banco.
Banco.
I kind of like Namdai.
That is a very, though, I have to say, Japanese-y thing to do.
The combination and shortening and... We need to bring back the poll on our website.
What's better, Banco or Namdai?
We'll see.
Anyway.
Well, we also have one of our... I don't think I've received an email from this person before.
Somebody, Matthew, has asked if we could talk about fear for the PC and are there any upcoming sequels or is it coming to any console platforms?
I'm going to be honest with you, Matthew.
We're human and we work day jobs as well as doing this show.
So because of that, we don't have time to play every single game that comes out.
So unfortunately, I've never touched the game Fear.
I've heard about it.
It looks neat.
I just can't afford it.
And amongst all my other gaming obsessions.
Loki, you look like you know something about this show.
I know of Fear and I know it's a really kick-ass first-person shooter.
I haven't played it.
The only real interaction with Fear that I've had is
watching Panics from Rooster Teeth, which, you know, known for Red vs. Blue.
I still laugh about that.
So definitely check that out because that's hilarious.
But yeah, I think it is coming to the 360, probably something that's either going to be late this year or next year, but it's definitely a game that's going to be ported over at some point.
All right.
Macman also points out that Apple says they're working with a new company later to be revealed.
His theory is that Apple and Nintendo are working together on the revolution because they've both released cube-shaped systems.
It's a crazy theory and obviously not the right reason.
But don't put anything past those guys.
If any company is going to be sneaking behind your back...
It's those two.
Well, there is a mention in here.
Apple said they're making a move toward the gaming market and the iMac Mini G6 hooks up to your TV.
Interesting.
Well, you never know.
Dot, dot, dot.
Anything else in the mailbag?
Actually, one of our listeners, Mike, wants to know about where we import from.
Well, just send him a few of my favorites, but more he's asking, are mod chips hard to install?
More like for GameCube.
You don't need to put a mod chip in your GameCube at all.
There's a disc you can get to swap them out.
I actually have a legitimate Japanese PlayStation 2 because I didn't want to risk mod chips, you know, back when it was early, so...
I hear they're okay now, but I just didn't want to risk it, so I have an authentic Japanese PlayStation 2.
But I actually did email him back some sites, and if anyone wants to talk to me in the chat room, I'll mention some, just not on the air.
No free advertising.
No free advertising.
However, I'm sure that any number of those sites will ship to Canada.
Oh, yeah.
Sure.
Business is business.
Hooray, new emailers!
He's actually, though, I think on our forums, too.
Okay.
But he wants to say how much he enjoys the podcast.
Thank you.
And that we do a great show.
He's wondering, since we're changing our format, if the live show will be able to be, if you can listen live through the PSP.
I'm not so sure that it's got the... It doesn't have the capability for that.
No, but anything's possible.
All it would have to be able to do is... Basically, essentially how... Streaming audio.
Yeah, streaming audio, how Winamp does it.
Because you can listen... Nope.
We use Live365 to do our live stream, and you can load that in Winamp.
So if Winamp is ported to PSP, it could happen.
But, Loki, you're saying don't count on it.
Why is that?
It's just...
They won't do it.
The only way that would be feasible to do that is when there's a new firmware that supports Flash.
And then you could do a Flash player for Live 365, because I know that exists.
I've tried to come up with a way to do it, but no, you're not going to be able to do it with just JavaScript.
So unfortunately, no, the only way you're going to be able to do it is the podcast for now.
Wait and download, yep.
Yeah.
The last bit of this email is also the podcast week of 1906 to 1506.
You said they, I forgot who, is bringing a Sega Genesis game, Beggar Prince, to America.
I honestly don't see why they are doing that.
It just seems like a waste of money.
Not that many people have their Genesis anymore.
I'll give one of our other podcast buddies a plug here because he actually has somebody from that team who's putting out that game tonight.
Check out Bobby Blackwolf this week, allgames.com slash podcast because they're actually interviewing.
One of the people that is behind that game.
So check it out, and I will be, because I'm curious about that same thing.
How are they going to get 42 bucks?
Those of us who have a Nomad will be happy.
And if you don't have a Genesis, you know, if you still have a Dreamcast, there's always Under Defeat, which is another game that was actually being brought up for the Dreamcast relatively soon.
Let's not give up on those old systems.
They're still making 2600 games.
This is true.
This is true.
Alright, so we're going to go ahead and close up the old mailbag here, but DarkSakura, you're not quite finished with us just yet, because you have a story about Dragon Quest and the Revolution?
Woohoo!
Kinda?
Sort of?
Maybe?
Well, um, Hori Yuji, who was the, uh,
The project lead and the series producer for Dragon Quest VIII, he was actually at a launch event in Europe for that, actually it was in London, and said that he was very excited about the Revolutions controller and touched on more global views for selling Dragon Quest.
You know what?
What?
This is going to sound really awful, being the gamer that I am.
I have never played a single Dragon Quest game.
Wow.
Gas, that's really interesting.
But, I mean, well, we all admit it.
I was busy playing Guardian Legend.
I didn't see Star Wars until I was in college.
I haven't seen Star Wars except for one of them.
That's it.
Well, there you go.
You want to know what's sad?
We all have our things.
Star Wars was my first movie.
I was one years old.
Wow.
Well, okay, wait, back to, back to, back to, back to Dragon Quest.
Okay, so, DarkSakura, Miklatov, you know what game I'm talking about, yes?
Yes, yes.
Okay, I'll look over here then.
It's Toriyama.
The game, yeah, the game.
Well, I know the art.
No, no, no, the one where you have the sword.
With the sword.
And you go up to the TV and you go, slash.
Yeah.
It's really cool looking.
So this doesn't surprise me at all.
But I hope this means we'll, you know, see, you know, some Dragon Quest games on the Revolution.
That'll be kind of cool.
Or Zelda with the sword.
You just made me think about something, though.
Playing Rod Calibur.
Yes, you can play Soul Calibur with the fishing rod on the Dreamcast Just thought I'd let you guys know
But there's a, just to read one of the quotes from this article.
It says, when I was making manga, I met with the technology of computer games, he told journalists.
I love the fact that it was interactive and that you could do something and you get feedback.
I thought it was an interactive story where you could get feedback and rewards from everything that you do.
It would be interesting.
I like the idea of interactivity with the hardware.
So there, when you mention the Nintendo controller, it's a new interface and it's exciting to have that kind of reaction.
You do something and it reacts to you.
It's human nature to have something feedback from your actions that's rewarding.
Very interesting.
So we'll see what they decide to produce on the revolution.
Loki, you have some more information on what's going on with the revolution.
Some of it rumors, some of it facts.
What's going on?
Some of the stuff, I'm going to consider most of this rumor for now.
Well, first off, they had a survey that went out to a couple of gaming sites, one of them being ClassicGaming.com, I believe.
and it was talking about the virtual console that they were going to be using as kind of like their storefront for all these retro games that you're going to be able to play and download to your system and they were kind of showing some mock-ups of what the system is going to look like and they have basically where you can choose the different consoles kind of very similar to like a game tap type of thing get the rent or buy games you can do it you know buy each game individually kind of like the Xbox Live Arcade or you can you know
Pay a subscription fee and actually be able to download whatever for that month.
So I thought that was pretty cool and it kind of ties into that.
They have a patent that was actually filed for their virtual console and it kind of covered a few things about how the emulator is going to work.
Basically, they're saying that
The emulator is actually not going to be downloaded to the system.
It's not going to be on the system the entire time.
They'll actually kind of download either with the games or will be on some sort of DVD type of thing.
The other thing that's talked about is you can actually, they will be able to emulate possibly the portable game systems, of course, like Game Boy and stuff, possibly DS titles.
Also, they were saying that the emulation system
May be used with other consoles, not necessarily the Nintendo Revolution.
Which brings to the point, maybe they're going to license this to other people or something like that.
Which is quite interesting.
And also, I think we mentioned this a while back on some of the mock-ups for the Revolution where it said choose character.
It covers a patent for replacing characters in legacy games.
basically being able to use your own avatar say in Super Mario Brothers so you'll be able to play it as Link or Samus or something like that which is interesting so yeah there's some rumor mill stuff the other thing though they did mention though was a list of titles that were going to be kind of launch titles for this virtual console some notable ones for the NES everybody's dying to get this Kid Icarus
and I was kind of surprised at the Super Nintendo.
They actually have some of the Super Soap 6 games, Battle Clash, the actual Super Soap 6 game and some other stuff.
Super Metroid is awesome.
And of course, Nintendo 64, you've got to have Pilot Wings, Pokemon Snap, Paper Mario, and GoldenEye.
Sweet.
Now, through the magic of radio, I actually ran out to go pee while you were talking.
So, did you get... You're listening to KTMI.
Did you get to the DS redesign one?
Because I'm curious about that, too.
No, not yet.
All right, well, I want to hear this.
Jumping to conclusions.
Sorry, I just, you know, I'm like, okay, you know, we get it.
Nintendo's going to let us download old games, and we can be all fanboyish about what games, but we still don't know shit until E3, really.
So this is all redundant to me.
No offense.
I appreciate you bringing the news.
Now, the whole redesign on the DS.
Nothing official has been announced yet.
That's happening tomorrow, or actually on this Monday, the 16th.
Or maybe yesterday, depending on when you're listening to this.
Yes, it depends on when you're listening to this.
It'll actually be announced on the 16th.
They're supposed to make an official announcement about the redesign.
Some of the things that they're suspecting are going to be part of this announcement is... Pink.
All pink.
No, that's going to be more of a rounded, kind of a cell phone-like design.
and free voice over IP calls.
It's good basically to have that built into it now.
The Nintendo gauge.
Seriously.
No, but the other thing, there are some mock-ups people have done with interesting ideas for it where they're saying the console will fold down to almost like a Game Boy SP type of design.
Kind of like a little small case.
I thought that was a really cool design.
Of course, that was all fan-done, but we'll hear more
We'll probably have more next week about this and what announcements are going to be made.
Basically, we know that the system is selling like crazy in Japan.
They can't keep it on shelves.
I thought I read a story this week, though, that the PSP finally outsold it for a week somewhere.
I thought I read somewhere at PSP.
Only because they didn't have any.
Yeah, because they were sold out.
Anyways.
Don't try to make that system sound like it's better than the DS.
No, I'm just saying.
I'm just reporting it.
Speaking of Nintendo and DS, if you have Animal Crossing DS, hurry up and take your butt on Wi-Fi because there's actually a little special present that you can get right now.
And if you go on Wi-Fi, you can just open your gate and close it.
But if you go on Wi-Fi, you're going to get a message, a little piece of mail in your box from the president of Nintendo.
And enclosed is a Mario coin.
I have a Mario coin.
And when you tap the A button next to the Mario coin, it goes boing.
We phased out...
DarkSakura's F.U.
of the Week
This is the part where we have to get a little bit angsty.
Now, chat room, usually you guys submit your FUs.
We're going to get to that during the special live program later on in the night.
This is just for right now.
We're going to do some FUs because, damn it, we're angsty.
Right, DarkSakra?
Oh, yeah.
My F you tonight occurred on the way to the show.
F you to people who think that they can pull out of parking lots in front of the oncoming traffic.
As in stupid, and also people who decide that they don't want to be in the lane they're in and so they're halfway in that lane and the other.
I experienced the two together today.
One stupid person in this old beat up looking Cadillac was halfway in
the turning lane that I needed to be in and halfway in the going forward lane and then this car decides that he's going to turn in a completely black VW lane and I'm like, uh-uh.
I nosed my way up in the Silver Lancer of Love.
If this were burnout, this guy would be dead meat.
I've nosed up, I pointed at the man and said, you back up.
And he just gave me this look of utter surprise and did it.
I was like, that's right, you bow down.
And then, my car, being the most nimble and beautiful vehicle in existence, managed to navigate around the evil Cadillac.
I do not know how I did it, because I had almost no clearance, but I made it.
And I am here, and I was here early.
So, F you to the morons on the road.
Alright, Loki, your F you of the week.
Um, basically, my only F you is gonna be that, you know, I have to wait some time to actually get full auto...
I want to know.
My FU is to the lack of Xbox 360s.
Damn you, Microsoft, for not putting enough out there.
And damn you, eBayers, for fucking it all up.
Nico Todd, do you have an FU?
Sure.
FU to not having tomorrow off like everybody else in the world.
I work for a bank, so I get off.
All right.
All right.
Hey, that was PC.
All right, so that was our FUs of the week.
I have to do something that I've promised.
What's that?
Hello to Mistress Tia in the chat room.
Thank you.
All right, don't forget, we tape our podcast live now, everybody.
If you're going like, what the F are these people on?
All right, moving on.
Let's get to our next article tonight.
Loki, what's going on with the game Gun?
When's the sequel coming out?
The sequel's coming out probably either close to never.
Yes, Gun and True Crime unfortunately weren't the breakout hits that they had hoped they would be.
And it's rumored now that they've actually been cancelled due to low sales of both games.
And actually I can kind of back this up distribution wise.
Anybody that's direct with Activision right now is actually getting a nice price break on the Gun and True Crime New York City.
They're selling them for about $10 a pop.
Of course you have to buy like 4,000 units but
The point is that the game's not selling what it's supposed to be.
I thought they were really good games, but apparently I was wrong.
Now, what's going on with Ragnarok Online?
This is a follow-up to something we talked about last week on the show, right?
Mm-hmm.
You're pouting over there.
Why?
Loki has to say.
What's up, Loki?
Well, there was a rumor that Ragnarok Online was coming to the DS.
Of course, it ended up being another funny Photoshop.
So somebody actually Photoshopped from Famitsu Magazine some article to make it look like Ragnarok was actually coming on the DS.
Do you think it was someone that listens to the show that got the idea?
No.
Maybe.
Maybe.
You never know.
Doubt it.
We do have listeners in Japan.
That's true.
It's true.
You never know.
All right.
Guitar Freaks Guitar Hero Guitar Freaks
One of the major importers.
There is news that there is a super deluxe Japanese arcade style controller for Guitar Freaks coming out.
Um...
To go ahead and read this quote, I'm just going to read directly from here.
Last night, Konami gave the green light for the production of the ASC guitar for use with Guitar Freaks games.
Although the final specs of the guitar are not available for perusal yet, the company's website specifies that it will be modeled closely after the guitar used at the Coinop GF machines.
Now, you can't use a Guitar Freaks controller, though, on a Guitar Hero game.
That's important to know.
Actually, yes, you can.
Can you?
I thought I read an article that said you couldn't.
Yes, you can.
How?
You plug it in.
But what about the... Can you only play the three?
You can only play an easy, but you can use it.
It will work.
Weird.
I thought that you couldn't do it.
You just can't will hard.
Digg.com
This is a good way for you to, you know, cut loose, so to speak.
You remind me of one of the more embarrassing moments in my relationship with my husband.
Oh, then you must share.
You must share.
I go into the living room one day at one of our older apartments, and Dan, I was playing pata pata, and I went off, like, to go to the bathroom or something.
I come back in, and Dan's got the guitar freaks controller doing air guitar freaks to pata pata.
Like, it was frightening.
Wow.
Wow.
Air Guitar Freaks.
Creative.
So I'm going to patent that idea and sell it to Konami.
Air Guitar Freaks.
You can try.
Using the eye toy.
We'll see what happens.
E.A.
is bringing Lord of the Rings Battle for Middle-Earth 2.
to Xbox 360 in the summertime.
It's a real-time strategy game based on the PC version that's due out on March 3rd.
That's in the UK.
And it will be the first Lord of the Rings game to work on Xbox Live.
They're saying it will have a new and intuitive console-specific control scheme.
And I like the quote in here.
It says, A promise is a promise, EA.
Remember that.
So I thought that was very interesting.
Them spiting words.
Yep.
also another one that I am personally very excited about is Sonic Riders because one of my favorite games of all time is Sonic R that's a great game, that's an amazing game right there and I actually have Sonic R for the PC which I still play because it's hard to go back and play it on the Saturn because the graphics are just so much better on the PC one and I do have it on Saturn as well but Sonic Riders just looks like it's Sonic R done right, you know what I mean?
Anything that was wrong in Sonic R, Sonic Riders is doing better.
They all have these hoverboard things and basically shoot through levels that look like they're ripped right out of Sonic Adventure.
It's pretty cool.
As long as Super Sonic Racing is in that song, I'll be happy.
Sega loves us.
Really?
Where's the free games then?
Hey!
Why is Phantasy Star delayed?
I know!
I get the free games.
Shut up.
There's actually also another thing in here too that I thought was kind of neat.
It actually makes me think of Arctic Thunder.
It's tricky!
Game on, it's tricky!
Bad joke, if you've ever played SSX.
Four of the tracks listed are Metal City, Splash Canyon, Egg Factory, and Sand Ruins.
Where's Casino Zone?
Because every Sonic game's got to have a casino zone.
You need Casino Night, okay?
There's always a casino or pinball zone or something.
You know what the music I would love to hear in this?
What's that?
I would love to hear a remix of the Ice Cap music from Sonic 3.
The little disco-y dance-y one.
I thought it was pretty cool.
It was like trance and 16-bit.
Also, one other game coming out, Sengoku Basara sequel coming out for PS2, put out by Capcom.
And the original development team is returning for that, including Kobayashi Hiroyuki, who is behind Resident Evil 4, and Yamamoto Makoto, who is Piano 3, which that game wasn't all that great, but still.
Okay, I'm going to admit, I've never even heard of Sengoku Basara 1.
What are these games?
It's... This one's actually...
They... I'm trying... It's a historical beat-em-up type game.
Oh, okay.
Like a Dynasty Warriors or something?
Yeah.
But this one... And I just know, because I know several people who are into the series, so I thought I would mention it.
But this one, they actually have an art of one of the new characters, who is Maeda Keiji, who is...
They say a historical warrior.
Actually, I have a year on here, 1543 to 1612, who lived during the reign of Toyotomi Hideyoshi in the Sengoku period.
So that was pretty cool.
All right.
And then something about a contest?
Yes, a contest for folks in the UK.
Can I enter?
No.
Oh, this is a sucky contest.
It's not fair.
Would you like to win a DS and Prince of Persia?
Basically, with this particular contest, you can, again, win Battles of Prince of Persia and a DS.
The entry is on Yahoo UK Games.
So just give a clue.
Actually, I'll go ahead and... The URL is very long, so just go to Yahoo UK and Ireland Games and give it a hunt.
Now, if you win, and you heard about it from us, you're going to have to cut your DS in half and send half to us, because that's our commission.
So we get one screen of your DS if you win.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Blood Rain was set to open in 1,900 theaters.
It ended up showing less than 1,000 screens and, like I said, made barely a million dollars.
In addition, hundreds of theaters reported receiving prints of the film that they didn't order.
Needless to say, they refused to screen them.
That's a wonderful tactic.
Send the prints to the theaters that won't carry it so that they might accidentally put it on screen.
In other news, Uybol is a giant douche.
Basically, he hates everything that has to do... Don't hold back now.
He hates everything that has to do with Hollywood, calling them as greedy thieves.
Those greedy thieves are paying to finance your movies, ironically enough.
Also, during the premiere for BloodRayne, actors were brought on stage so Evil can make a little speech, but forced them not to speak because he hates when actors talk.
And finally, I don't know, he's just... He's really in the right business.
Yeah, he's just
I read that on the internet so it must be true.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
and you know what?
We're getting Silent Hill and that looks amazing.
April 21st.
April 21st.
Pyramid Head's going to be up in thinking half.
Two days after my birthday so whoever wants to buy me a ticket to see it.
See, we're going to get a good movie.
Why not get a bad movie in the form of Metal Gear Solid?
I think it would be great.
Because it's solid.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You know what we need?
We need to have Snake done by someone really hot but voiced over by David Hayter and have David Hayter write the script.
DarkSakura, you were telling me a little bit about this before the show.
What's going on here?
Well, there are some very...
There's a bit of a speculative article about for the game year in review for 2010.
This made me... In the year 2010.
Yeah, thank you.
Never mind, you don't watch TV, so you don't get it.
It's Conan O'Brien.
I don't watch TV.
I have a life.
It's the show to watch.
Every college kid loves.
I know we're older than college kids.
No, I'm a college kid.
At heart, we're college kids.
You know what I'm busy doing?
College?
Playing Animal Crossing.
Dude, I'm taking Flash Animation, what are you talking about?
Well, the speculation is Sony's attempt to hang on to its thin lead in the gaming industry by only selling the PlayStation 4 to 6 carefully chosen celebrities.
Seems like it might backfire.
Children's crayon drawings of the PS4 going for over $400 on eBay.
Please tell me, for the love of God, Paris Hilton will not still be a celebrity in 2010.
Paris Hilton is reported to have held the new console briefly at arm's length before throwing it in the closet.
God damn it.
Who made these predictions, Ms.
Cleo?
Nintendo creates the Nintendo apocalypse.
that will like any type of game controller whatsoever.
How about the Nintendo Fuck Your Shit Up?
Instead, you will direct the on-screen action by grabbing a household pet by the front legs and making it do a little dance.
This is the exciting wheelbarrow controller.
Featuring WarioWare Yardwork mode.
That'd be great.
Nintendo Faithful pointed out this is still better than a gamepad for first-person shooters.
On the handheld front, Sony and Nintendo continue their fight for the minds and backpacks of the nation's gamers by releasing ever-larger portable consoles.
The Nintendo XL with six screens, a folding seat, and selection of overpriced candy bars.
While the PlayStation's still ostensibly portal, can now play all forms of media, including two-ton cuneiform tablets.
This is absurd.
This is absurd.
Where can people read this?
This is unwired.
Wired.com.
I'll post the link in the chat room for those listeners privileged to hang out there.
We're getting towards the end of the show here, believe it or not, but what a good way to go out than to talk about sex.
Let's talk about sex, baby.
Let's talk about sex on the Xbox 360.
Not literally sex on your Xbox 360, but Loki.
You probably could.
It's big enough.
On that power supply, you might be able to do something raunchy with that.
All right, kids, cover your ears.
Rez controller time.
Loki.
Let's try to keep it clean, Loki.
What's this with HD porn coming into 360?
This has to be a load of crap, right?
No, actually, the first movie that they're bringing over, there's a couple companies there behind it.
The first one being Arrow Productions, which is bringing the HD version of Deep Throat, very classic adult film, to the Xbox 360.
I'm not quite sure...
How they're going to do this, or what format it's going to be in, I don't know.
My guess is probably WMV HD format, so Windows Media.
Anyways, so look forward to that.
There's actually going to be some more info about it.
DeepthroatHD.com is where you'll want to watch for the news on that.
How do we know this isn't a load of crap?
Just because the website's registered, I don't know.
I'm taking this with a huge grain of salt here.
How could they possibly... This is actually from the adult video conference.
Basically, they had a DVD version and this HD version playing side by side.
But see, the whole thing that makes me real skeptical about this, and this is where I'm going into for Next Company, which is actually... Let's see here.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Is there ever?
Well, you know me.
I'm such a little horn dog.
I had to find about Sex and Video Games Conference.
There is a conference going on in San Francisco June 8th to 9th at the Knob Hill Masonic Center that is the Sex and Video Games Conference exploring the business of digital erotic entertainment.
Panels include Creating Mainstream Erotic Games, Integrating International Success to the U.S.
Market,
Emergent Sex and Video Games and Video Game Hardware, Creating Successful Online Erotic Games, Investing in Sexually Themed Games, Alternative Distribution Methods for AO Games, and MMOEG Panel.
Massively Multiplayer Online Erotic Game?
Was that orgy the game?
Orgy for PC.
DarkSakura, I think you need to do some field work and attend this conference and bring back a full report.
Do you want to pay for it?
No.
How much is it to go?
Do we know?
Probably too much.
Well, you can save over 40% of the registration fee by signing in for it by May 7, 2006.
Early bird price is $295.
Through June 6, $395.
On-site, $495.
They better have naked chicks there.
You know what that would be, though?
Huh?
That would be half the price of my new iMac.
So, no.
All right.
Last thing for the night, and then we're going to call it a show.
This whole sex in video games thing makes me think.
Are video games sexy enough or too sexy?
And if you're going to say not sexy enough, what could they do to make games more sexy?
DarkSakura.
See, I think that I'm actually too sexy for the games.
No, no, no.
You misinterpreted my question.
You know what?
You know what?
I'm going to go back, because the old standby, our motto, applies to this.
Gameplay!
It is the gameplay that makes a game good.
It does not have to have hot, naked people in it, and, you know, pantsless rage, and... It doesn't need to have all of... You know, I think it's fine to make it attractive, and I think that if the, you know... I do have to say that the average...
Lokey?
I would say it's a complete waste of the whole next-gen of gaming.
We do not have HD titties in there.
Because goddammit, we need HD titties to be on this next-gen console.
Where are my adult-only games?
If they have a goddamn adult-only rating system, I want adult games to be on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.
I want my nudity.
And I want my extreme violence as well.
I want things that will make Jack Thompson go crazy.
And in fact, I want the next Grand Theft Auto to be so outrageous and bad that it's banned from half the world.
Only I get to play.
That's what I want to see because I think that's what we need.
And you know what?
I agree with you about the gameplay.
That's where the revolution comes in.
And damn it, Nintendo didn't get to jump on this bandwagon with, you know, sex games.
I can't wait to see Playboy the Mansion 2.
Is that the revolution?
Full frontal nudity?
Res 2.
Alright, comments from our chat room.
We have some folks.
More naked males, of course, you know.
The women and gay men, you know, need some cock.
As far as the asexuals, though.
What?
They have Tetris.
Let's see.
Some various comments here from Fireboma and GS191.
More Cowbell.
We do need more Cowbell.
All right.
On that note, I think it's about time we wrap things up here on Orange Lounge Radio.
It was a great first show, though.
Thank you guys for tuning in and listening or downloading it.
It was a little different.
I think some of our folks who listened to previous podcasts might be shocked.
But it's 170.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
No Grand Theft DDR evil chatroom.
Stop paying attention to the chatroom.
They'll go away.
All right, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
Miklatov, I know you didn't talk a whole lot tonight, but thank you for being here and being moral support.
You're welcome.
And anything you want for games to be sexier?
No, because I think that's kind of stupid.
Except if it's hot guys.
Other than that, it's stupid.
And what's your final thought?
Oh, I want to play some more World of Warcraft right now.
All right.
Loki, your final thought.
I'm going to check out DOA 4 this week.
My final thought is I want an Xbox 360 at the store.
DarkSakura, your final thought?
Reject false icons.
All right, that's going to do it.
Thanks so much for tuning in and listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
We'll see you next week.
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
