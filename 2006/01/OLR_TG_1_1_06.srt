[SPEAKER_03]: Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

4
00:00:18,966 --> 00:00:20,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy New Year, everybody!

5
00:00:20,486 --> 00:00:25,267
[SPEAKER_06]: You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio, radio about video games that don't suck.

6
00:00:26,488 --> 00:00:30,289
[SPEAKER_06]: All the news that you true gamers really want to know about, because we care.

7
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:35,922
[SPEAKER_06]: and we want to tell you what's going on in the gaming world, even during a slow news week such as this one.

8
00:00:36,242 --> 00:00:37,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope you all had a great new year.

9
00:00:37,423 --> 00:00:38,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope you all had a safe new year.

10
00:00:39,364 --> 00:00:40,185
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Rob Roberts.

11
00:00:40,205 --> 00:00:40,985
[SPEAKER_06]: You might know me as Sky.

12
00:00:41,025 --> 00:00:44,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Joining me as always, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

13
00:00:44,387 --> 00:00:46,108
[SPEAKER_00]: The world couldn't handle more than one of me.

14
00:00:46,428 --> 00:00:47,029
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing?

15
00:00:47,889 --> 00:00:49,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Sober.

16
00:00:50,511 --> 00:00:52,372
[SPEAKER_06]: We were taping right after our live show, of course.

17
00:00:53,008 --> 00:00:57,555
[SPEAKER_06]: We did a little bit of drinking on tonight's live show, so Loki and I are a little tipsy.

18
00:00:57,795 --> 00:00:58,716
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're safe about it.

19
00:00:59,237 --> 00:01:03,443
[SPEAKER_06]: I live here, and Loki brought the fiancÃ© to drive, so we're just having fun.

20
00:01:03,603 --> 00:01:04,064
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all right.

21
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:08,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Make this a little more chatty on these slow news weeks.

22
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:13,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, and I'm not throwing up today, so that's great.

23
00:01:13,696 --> 00:01:14,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't we do this before?

24
00:01:14,516 --> 00:01:17,679
[SPEAKER_04]: We've done a drunken podcast before, yes.

25
00:01:17,699 --> 00:01:19,560
[SPEAKER_04]: We've done it before where I haven't thrown up.

26
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,963
[SPEAKER_04]: It was that one time that I kind of miscalculated how much alcohol I was consuming.

27
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:23,943
[SPEAKER_01]: He was sitting on the floor.

28
00:01:24,844 --> 00:01:28,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Over there in that corner, Loki, since I haven't introduced you, but you're talking anyway, there you go.

29
00:01:28,787 --> 00:01:31,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, here I am, 13 shots down.

30
00:01:33,274 --> 00:01:36,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Drinking my drink of choice, which would be a screwdriver.

31
00:01:37,742 --> 00:01:45,695
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to try to shy away from that next time just because orange juice is so acidic it kind of upsets my stomach if I drink too much of it.

32
00:01:47,432 --> 00:01:49,053
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

33
00:02:05,345 --> 00:02:14,331
[SPEAKER_00]: My gaming week has been filled with lots and lots of Animal Crossing and a little Popolo Cross whenever I could get the PSP away from Dan.

34
00:02:14,411 --> 00:02:25,017
[SPEAKER_00]: However, he has actually gone back and gotten rid of some of our games like Smackdown vs. Raw and his copy of Animal Crossing.

35
00:02:25,077 --> 00:02:29,660
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those who had Dan on their friends list, he may as well take them all because he ain't playing.

36
00:02:30,681 --> 00:02:31,841
[SPEAKER_00]: But he picked up Dead or Alive 4.

37
00:02:33,175 --> 00:02:37,136
[SPEAKER_00]: and the joystick, which I haven't used, but I've heard both ways about it.

38
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:40,277
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear it's pretty nice, but people have their own preferences.

39
00:02:41,717 --> 00:02:43,838
[SPEAKER_00]: That game, though, oh my god.

40
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:50,900
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to quote something from my husband's live journal, which I think is probably one of the most accurate descriptions of Dead or Alive 4.

41
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,300
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the quote here.

42
00:02:55,641 --> 00:02:59,122
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dead or alive again with really good backgrounds, bad hair, and 100% more hard.

43
00:03:01,497 --> 00:03:08,964
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what they did, they've gotten rid of some of the recovery time in that game and you have to be freaking fast to do your counters.

44
00:03:09,084 --> 00:03:09,965
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so much harder.

45
00:03:10,505 --> 00:03:17,572
[SPEAKER_00]: And on top of that, the boss is like naked Liquid Kasumi and it's like she's, you know, scary.

46
00:03:17,732 --> 00:03:18,713
[SPEAKER_06]: OMG, spoiler.

47
00:03:20,835 --> 00:03:21,215
[SPEAKER_00]: So?

48
00:03:21,516 --> 00:03:22,196
[SPEAKER_06]: It's alright.

49
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:23,257
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a fighting game.

50
00:03:23,497 --> 00:03:24,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, naked.

51
00:03:25,059 --> 00:03:26,040
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I needed to hear.

52
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:50,180
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's it's just she's ridiculously hard ridiculous that game is just ridiculously hard but the endings are freaking hilarious so all right uh Loki what about your gaming week my gaming week was also filled with a lot of Animal Crossing just I don't know the game is easy to play for like you know 10 minutes or whatever so I've been actually trying to pay off my

53
00:03:50,987 --> 00:03:51,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Need for Speed Most Wanted

54
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:17,380
[SPEAKER_04]: And that game is pretty sweet for the 360.

55
00:04:19,222 --> 00:04:21,464
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very impressed on the graphics for it.

56
00:04:22,164 --> 00:04:25,468
[SPEAKER_04]: And the storyline that they have kind of going along with it is pretty cool.

57
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:27,910
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely like what they've done with it.

58
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,072
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of very involved.

59
00:04:30,172 --> 00:04:37,619
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very similar to like a Fast and the Furious type of storyline, you know, where your car basically gets...

60
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:47,846
[SPEAKER_04]: You lose your car in a match and you have to bring yourself back from nothing to winning the top of the blacklist.

61
00:04:47,906 --> 00:04:52,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically becoming the most wanted driver out there.

62
00:04:52,269 --> 00:04:53,030
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's very...

63
00:04:54,144 --> 00:04:55,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Project Gotham Racing 3 Project Gotham Racing 3

64
00:05:21,097 --> 00:05:33,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Project Gotham 3 is very similar to Gran Turismo, whereas this game is a Need for Speed Underground type game.

65
00:05:35,564 --> 00:05:39,246
[SPEAKER_04]: The physics aren't exactly accurate to the cars or whatever.

66
00:05:39,787 --> 00:05:40,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

67
00:06:01,477 --> 00:06:04,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Overall, though, I've played the game not too long.

68
00:06:04,641 --> 00:06:12,649
[SPEAKER_04]: I played it for about 30 minutes or so today, and I've gotten through kind of the intro storyline stuff and have actually gotten into the game.

69
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:22,320
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty cool so far, and I like the way that they've done, like, they have live actors in the actual game, but they've kind of blurred them out and kind of, you know...

70
00:06:22,993 --> 00:06:25,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Desaturated the actors so it kind of blends in with the background.

71
00:06:26,035 --> 00:06:29,176
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very stylistic but it's a cool game.

72
00:06:30,137 --> 00:06:48,126
[SPEAKER_04]: So I played that a lot and of course my standard Grand Theft Auto, Liberty City Stories I've been playing a lot of Grand Theft Auto multiplayer and of course Call of Duty 2 multiplayer which I love those games and seriously if you haven't picked up Grand Theft Auto, Liberty City Stories I highly recommend it for the PSP.

73
00:06:48,746 --> 00:06:50,827
[SPEAKER_04]: It is definitely one of the games to have

74
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:55,129
[SPEAKER_04]: for the PSP, and if not anything, just to play around with...

75
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,135
[SPEAKER_06]: The Trainer, which I'll go into later.

76
00:06:59,835 --> 00:07:04,776
[SPEAKER_06]: My gaming week, I've also been playing a little bit of Animal Crossing because I took such a break from it because I was playing Final Fantasy Advance 4.

77
00:07:05,937 --> 00:07:16,920
[SPEAKER_06]: I also was playing a crapload of H.E.R.O., an old school Atari 2600 game that I was playing on GameTap just because I used to play that game all the freaking time on the Commodore 64.

78
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:23,902
[SPEAKER_06]: And although the Atari 2600 version really sucks in comparison, it's still one of the better Atari 2600 games and highly underrated.

79
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:29,113
[SPEAKER_06]: and the fact that I have the second highest score of all time right now on the leaderboards over there.

80
00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:30,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations.

81
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:31,194
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm working on number one.

82
00:07:31,234 --> 00:07:34,116
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's just because no one plays it because people don't remember that game.

83
00:07:34,517 --> 00:07:35,838
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm working on number one.

84
00:07:35,878 --> 00:07:36,278
[SPEAKER_06]: I want it.

85
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:36,938
[SPEAKER_06]: I want it.

86
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:37,599
[SPEAKER_06]: It's within reach.

87
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:47,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, with the one gaming site that does the rankings and stuff, you can actually get... Oh, the... I can't... It escapes me right now.

88
00:07:48,047 --> 00:07:48,607
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't even remember.

89
00:07:49,047 --> 00:07:50,509
[SPEAKER_06]: We saw them at Classic Gaming Expo and everything.

90
00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:50,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

91
00:07:50,989 --> 00:07:53,571
[SPEAKER_04]: They're doing actually certificates now for if you...

92
00:07:54,059 --> 00:07:54,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

93
00:08:10,965 --> 00:08:11,866
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

94
00:08:28,214 --> 00:08:32,996
[SPEAKER_06]: You know you are a Nintendo geek when... And then all these lists of Nintendo things.

95
00:08:33,377 --> 00:08:35,558
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can't read them because I'd make it upside down.

96
00:08:35,578 --> 00:08:37,819
[SPEAKER_00]: Press up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start.

97
00:08:37,939 --> 00:08:38,719
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one of my favorites.

98
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:39,960
[SPEAKER_06]: But that only works on Konami.

99
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,221
[SPEAKER_06]: You spent your summer vacation in Hyrule.

100
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:42,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

101
00:08:43,062 --> 00:08:46,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, and actually one of my friends in Animal Crossing has a town named Hyrule.

102
00:08:46,103 --> 00:08:46,423
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway.

103
00:08:47,524 --> 00:08:47,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes?

104
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:55,292
[SPEAKER_00]: When Final Fantasy 3 came out over here, I said that I had the flu and stayed out of school for a week to play it.

105
00:08:55,653 --> 00:08:58,975
[SPEAKER_06]: I know this is radio, but she did the 3 with quotes.

106
00:09:00,175 --> 00:09:04,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really 3, but 3 does.

107
00:09:04,618 --> 00:09:09,741
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura got me the shirt, but Loki got me a copy of Mario & Luigi Partners in Time for the DS.

108
00:09:10,061 --> 00:09:12,022
[SPEAKER_06]: So I finally got a chance to check out this game a little bit.

109
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:13,864
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty cool.

110
00:09:13,904 --> 00:09:14,344
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very...

111
00:09:15,044 --> 00:09:15,424
[SPEAKER_06]: and so on.

112
00:09:42,896 --> 00:09:45,317
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, there's not a lot I can say about it.

113
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:51,860
[SPEAKER_06]: If you enjoyed Mario & Luigi Superstar Saga, this is almost the... It's a real true sequel.

114
00:09:52,321 --> 00:09:53,521
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very similar.

115
00:09:53,941 --> 00:09:55,062
[SPEAKER_06]: The look is the same.

116
00:09:55,422 --> 00:09:57,583
[SPEAKER_06]: They haven't changed what worked in that game.

117
00:09:58,163 --> 00:10:02,265
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if you're a fan of Super Mario RPG, these games are for you, really.

118
00:10:02,285 --> 00:10:03,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's... Even though...

119
00:10:03,706 --> 00:10:05,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Mario Superstar Saga, Paper Mario Super Mario RPG

120
00:10:20,442 --> 00:10:29,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, they need to have another Super Mario RPG just to come out, because that game was so solid.

121
00:10:30,026 --> 00:10:34,248
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a really good game overall, even if Square was in it.

122
00:10:35,128 --> 00:10:40,290
[SPEAKER_04]: It just was an awesome game, and they never really are going to touch that level of gaming ever again.

123
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:47,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing, though, about Partners in Time, and maybe I just haven't played enough into it yet, so I reserve the right to change my mind later, but

124
00:10:47,512 --> 00:10:49,833
[SPEAKER_06]: I think these games tend to get overrated a little bit.

125
00:10:49,973 --> 00:11:00,017
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they get looked at as revolutionary or something because they're not like your typical RPG because you press buttons along with the fighting to make it more interactive.

126
00:11:00,057 --> 00:11:03,358
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just fight, monster, go, you know, type thing.

127
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:04,939
[SPEAKER_06]: You actually hit the button at the right time.

128
00:11:05,479 --> 00:11:07,140
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know though, to me...

129
00:11:08,573 --> 00:11:10,954
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it... It seems to get a little repetitive.

130
00:11:11,014 --> 00:11:13,376
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like I'm always hitting the button at the same time.

131
00:11:13,396 --> 00:11:15,277
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm always dodging the same attack.

132
00:11:15,657 --> 00:11:20,580
[SPEAKER_06]: So it doesn't strike me as so freaking revolutionary as I think a lot of people tend to label this game.

133
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:28,564
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't lavish all this best game of the year praise on it, but I think it's good, and I recommend the game.

134
00:11:28,804 --> 00:11:34,147
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think there's better RPGs, but it's hard to say.

135
00:11:34,187 --> 00:11:36,168
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I don't want to get hate mail because...

136
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:45,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not that I'm afraid of getting a hate mail, I don't care, but it's the type of thing where it's, you know, I like the game, but I just don't think it's outstanding.

137
00:11:45,861 --> 00:11:50,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me put it this way, there's some that may stand out Nintendo DS games anyways.

138
00:11:51,033 --> 00:12:01,958
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, and this is a pretty good... If this was a year ago, I'd agree with you, but now, come on, we got Mario Kart, Meteos, and... Where the fuck else would you see something like Trauma Center?

139
00:12:01,978 --> 00:12:09,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let me put it this way, okay, this game is good, it's worth picking up, I mean, Nintendo DS games aren't that expensive, you can spend the $30 it is gonna be...

140
00:12:10,942 --> 00:12:13,403
[SPEAKER_04]: To pick up this game, I mean, it's worth it.

141
00:12:13,923 --> 00:12:22,247
[SPEAKER_04]: The other game that's going to be coming out that's going to be worth picking up is going to be actually Electroplankton, and that's actually only on the internet.

142
00:12:22,947 --> 00:12:25,328
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to be able to find that, because they're only selling it online.

143
00:12:26,468 --> 00:12:33,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably because they think it's too collective of a game, so that one's actually coming out in about a week or so from now.

144
00:12:34,272 --> 00:12:34,632
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um,

145
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:36,255
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

146
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:11,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's get into some news this week and talk about what's going on.

147
00:13:12,394 --> 00:13:15,337
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess we might as well start it off with a story on the Xbox 360.

148
00:13:15,757 --> 00:13:19,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, tell us what's going on with the Walmart and the kiosk and all this crazy 360 stuff.

149
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:26,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well Walmart for one, they've actually had a sale that was going on for the first of the year.

150
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:35,173
[SPEAKER_04]: They were doing their New Year's Day sale and each Walmart was supposed to be getting 12 360 systems, the premiums of course.

151
00:13:35,726 --> 00:13:35,966
[SPEAKER_04]: and so on.

152
00:14:00,842 --> 00:14:02,664
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

153
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:24,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we at the point now where we could actually walk into stores and find these yet?

154
00:14:25,042 --> 00:14:25,182
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

155
00:14:25,522 --> 00:14:27,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Because what about this whole thing?

156
00:14:27,322 --> 00:14:33,344
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a story on Dig.com earlier this week where it's like, search your local Best Buys for 360s.

157
00:14:33,404 --> 00:14:35,865
[SPEAKER_06]: And I noticed some were popping up in the area, but I didn't believe it.

158
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,226
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't going to waste a tank of gas to go down there.

159
00:14:38,246 --> 00:14:39,427
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not believe those things were staying.

160
00:14:39,467 --> 00:14:41,907
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I did post that in my live journal.

161
00:14:42,008 --> 00:14:45,689
[SPEAKER_04]: There's actually some in the area that said they had them in stock.

162
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:52,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, personally, I don't know if you had to go and ask if they had them, because I did not see them on the floor.

163
00:14:52,151 --> 00:15:00,373
[SPEAKER_04]: I was looking, actually, at their games, because I had a gift card to Best Buy, and I was checking out what they had, and it looked very picked through.

164
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:09,936
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a few 2K games and Quake 4 and stuff, but there's nothing that really, you know, striked me as, like, ooh, I gotta have this, you know.

165
00:15:09,956 --> 00:15:10,817
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very...

166
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

167
00:15:31,107 --> 00:15:34,151
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why, but it's in the best interest for the gamers.

168
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:48,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

169
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:51,772
[SPEAKER_04]: So this was kind of a sale thing that they were doing.

170
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:54,494
[SPEAKER_04]: They were stockpiling them for the sale.

171
00:15:54,594 --> 00:15:57,297
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm assuming probably they're all sold out now.

172
00:15:57,797 --> 00:16:06,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, however, you still want to be checking back with your GameStop because they're still trying to fill their pre-orders.

173
00:16:06,985 --> 00:16:09,527
[SPEAKER_04]: But Best Buy, they should be getting some in each week.

174
00:16:09,867 --> 00:16:11,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, they're probably not going to be on the floor.

175
00:16:11,809 --> 00:16:14,311
[SPEAKER_04]: You're probably going to have to ask and see if they have them in.

176
00:16:15,435 --> 00:16:22,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I've heard that Sam's Club has a lot of them coming in and Costco, those type of places.

177
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:24,040
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to check and see if they've got them in.

178
00:16:25,021 --> 00:16:28,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely, at this point, probably don't pay over retail for them.

179
00:16:28,323 --> 00:16:29,443
[SPEAKER_04]: You can probably find them.

180
00:16:30,043 --> 00:16:30,404
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just...

181
00:16:31,104 --> 00:16:34,907
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be hard right now because they're still trying to get them out in three different markets.

182
00:16:35,547 --> 00:16:37,448
[SPEAKER_04]: The European, Japanese, and U.S.

183
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:40,050
[SPEAKER_04]: And they can only make so many.

184
00:16:40,731 --> 00:16:41,771
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of tough right now.

185
00:16:41,811 --> 00:16:51,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's funny you mention Xbox 360 sales in Japan because I'm actually looking at an article from Nintendojo who ran an article on Japan sales from December 19th to the 25th.

186
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:54,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, why is Nintendojo running a story on the Xbox?

187
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they're not.

188
00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:00,884
[SPEAKER_06]: They're actually talking about, hey, the Nintendo DS is the top-selling toy in Japan this week before Christmas.

189
00:17:01,344 --> 00:17:04,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though I don't think Christmas is quite the same as it is here.

190
00:17:04,206 --> 00:17:07,527
[SPEAKER_06]: But nevertheless, the DS sold 597,628 units to be number one for the week.

191
00:17:07,547 --> 00:17:08,668
[SPEAKER_06]: The PSP, 161,332 units, making it number two.

192
00:17:08,688 --> 00:17:10,508
[SPEAKER_06]: But get this, Xbox 360, the seventh number.

193
00:17:20,871 --> 00:17:23,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Most Largest Selling System, is that most large?

194
00:17:23,452 --> 00:17:25,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Forget it.

195
00:17:25,092 --> 00:17:25,072
5,674.

196
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:32,895
[SPEAKER_04]: I would completely understand that because if you think about it, a lot of the RPGs that are supposed to come out didn't come out.

197
00:17:33,035 --> 00:17:36,777
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Elder Scrolls for one for the US didn't come out.

198
00:17:36,957 --> 00:17:39,938
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not coming out until I think March now.

199
00:17:40,098 --> 00:17:41,418
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's pretty sad.

200
00:17:41,838 --> 00:17:46,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Granted, it is to make the game a lot better because they figured out how to kind of utilize the

201
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:48,622
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

202
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:06,231
[SPEAKER_04]: DOA 4 in Japan

203
00:18:36,591 --> 00:19:01,007
[SPEAKER_04]: 3 or 4 big large RPGs that were coming out for the 360 in Japan which is sad because I wish we had gotten some of those over here as well but anyways they were supposed to be getting them and they've gotten delayed and pushed back I think it's probably because a lot of these companies out there that haven't had the 360 dev kits for long enough and they've realized either A they've

204
00:19:01,462 --> 00:19:01,862
[SPEAKER_04]: X-Wash 360 Kiosk

205
00:19:23,965 --> 00:19:25,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Got it hacked somehow?

206
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:33,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, apparently the disks for the kiosks were rushed so badly that they didn't actually sign them and they weren't encoded.

207
00:19:33,268 --> 00:19:41,710
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you can actually get an image of the kiosk disk and download it on your favorite hacker or BitTorrent or whatever site.

208
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:44,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that we endorse that, but we're just reporting on what's out there.

209
00:19:45,111 --> 00:19:50,593
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can download that and actually burn it onto a DVD and run it straight on your 360 and

210
00:19:51,893 --> 00:19:53,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, that has opened up a lot of things, though.

211
00:19:53,894 --> 00:19:57,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, first off, a few things we've noticed on this.

212
00:19:58,276 --> 00:20:02,118
[SPEAKER_04]: The Xbox Live game, they had a demo for Hexic HD.

213
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:05,100
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Shockwave file.

214
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:08,802
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually a compact flash type game that's on there.

215
00:20:08,902 --> 00:20:12,464
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can actually run that in Internet Explorer if you wanted to.

216
00:20:12,604 --> 00:20:15,585
[SPEAKER_04]: So no wonder these PopCap games seem to port over so easy.

217
00:20:15,765 --> 00:20:16,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, exactly.

218
00:20:16,686 --> 00:20:19,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's just running a Shockwave file.

219
00:20:19,507 --> 00:20:20,588
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really...

220
00:20:21,724 --> 00:20:25,312
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I kind of feel that it's a bit of a rip-off if you think about it.

221
00:20:25,332 --> 00:20:29,060
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're paying $10 for these games, and they're actually Compact Flash.

222
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,646
[SPEAKER_06]: But if it's a really good game.

223
00:20:32,711 --> 00:20:33,191
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

224
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:42,315
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways, this does open up a lot of things because now you can actually develop applications for it and rename them to these files and run them in there.

225
00:20:42,455 --> 00:20:45,897
[SPEAKER_04]: So it opens up a huge store for homebrew stuff.

226
00:20:46,257 --> 00:20:49,858
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing I was actually looking forward to was the fact that

227
00:20:53,880 --> 00:21:01,346
[SPEAKER_04]: These demo kiosks, if you've seen them out there, you can actually bring your Xbox 360 memory unit and download themes.

228
00:21:01,406 --> 00:21:05,970
[SPEAKER_04]: These themes actually correspond with the faceplates you can buy for your 360.

229
00:21:07,691 --> 00:21:10,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Hot Rod, Flames, Woodgrain, whatever they have.

230
00:21:12,615 --> 00:21:20,321
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing is, the files in these themes are actually ping files and you can actually replace them with

231
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Your own graphics to create custom themes.

232
00:21:23,761 --> 00:21:30,083
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is we haven't figured out completely 100% on how to define where these files end or whatnot.

233
00:21:30,264 --> 00:21:33,025
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you can't make your custom themes yet, but it's close.

234
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,465
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to be coming out with that.

235
00:21:34,605 --> 00:21:36,346
[SPEAKER_06]: So tell me this real quick, and then we'll move on to something else.

236
00:21:36,726 --> 00:21:39,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Because my mind's still back here on the whole rename the Flash thing.

237
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:44,849
[SPEAKER_06]: So possibly if we could get an emulator, and I know they exist already, an NES emulator in Flash.

238
00:21:45,376 --> 00:21:48,098
[SPEAKER_06]: It could run on this, maybe.

239
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:14,852
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a Nintendo game and rename it and put it on a disc with just this.

240
00:22:14,932 --> 00:22:19,380
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is what's great about this is you can actually create your own CD with

241
00:22:20,307 --> 00:22:34,332
[SPEAKER_04]: just this hexic demo or whatever in it and you can put your Flash stuff on there so you can in effect use this file to create your own homebrew with using Flash programs so you can run Flash on the 360.

242
00:22:34,512 --> 00:22:38,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't it amazing that all we want to do with these new systems is play the old ones like with the PSP?

243
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:49,237
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the thing that's most interesting about this is that the fact that Microsoft was touting that their game system was going to be unhackable and yet they make this

244
00:22:49,477 --> 00:22:49,937
[SPEAKER_04]: and so on.

245
00:23:11,246 --> 00:23:23,640
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got this big huge opening where all the simulation is possible and what they're working on is actually getting to run ISOs on it so that you can run the games that they have ripped off the discs.

246
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:26,376
[SPEAKER_06]: God of War

247
00:23:56,593 --> 00:23:56,974
[SPEAKER_06]: 4.

248
00:23:56,613 --> 00:23:56,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Darwinia

249
00:24:04,865 --> 00:24:05,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, interesting.

250
00:24:06,185 --> 00:24:06,366
[SPEAKER_05]: For PC.

251
00:24:06,386 --> 00:24:07,326
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

252
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:11,467
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the game basically... I love a comment on here.

253
00:24:11,507 --> 00:24:16,128
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Darwinia proves that the little guy can create something beautiful even if no one is smart enough to actually buy it.

254
00:24:17,409 --> 00:24:18,729
[SPEAKER_00]: Three, Shadow of the Colossus.

255
00:24:19,549 --> 00:24:20,029
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

256
00:24:20,249 --> 00:24:22,110
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

257
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,110
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't really buy into the hype on Shadow of the Colossus.

258
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:26,271
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was a little... It was a pretty game.

259
00:24:26,691 --> 00:24:28,552
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a very boring game.

260
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:29,432
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

261
00:24:29,492 --> 00:24:31,452
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't click with me, but anyway.

262
00:24:31,892 --> 00:24:33,393
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, Resident Evil 4.

263
00:24:34,403 --> 00:24:38,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Psychonauts was a good game, but I think it was maybe a bit underrated, but still...

264
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:02,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Average.

265
00:25:02,582 --> 00:25:05,704
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't like, you know, wow, it's completely different.

266
00:25:06,124 --> 00:25:12,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, the whole game involved you using psychic powers or whatever to, like, manipulate different things.

267
00:25:12,268 --> 00:25:17,131
[SPEAKER_04]: I was also done Advent Rising, which is another game that came out very similar to that.

268
00:25:17,812 --> 00:25:21,594
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a very revolutionary game, but a good game overall.

269
00:25:22,455 --> 00:25:22,815
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

270
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,057
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we might get some letters on that one.

271
00:25:25,197 --> 00:25:36,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of letters, you can always email us at togoe at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura will dig through our mailbag with her nails and her claws.

272
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:37,126
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm kidding.

273
00:25:37,846 --> 00:25:40,768
[SPEAKER_06]: And she'll dig out the best letters and read them here on air.

274
00:25:41,008 --> 00:25:41,709
[SPEAKER_00]: With hot pokers.

275
00:25:41,929 --> 00:25:45,572
[SPEAKER_06]: togoe at orangeloungeradio.com is the address to send those emails to.

276
00:25:46,292 --> 00:25:49,134
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what are the kids writing in about this week?

277
00:25:50,575 --> 00:25:50,996
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually...

278
00:25:53,514 --> 00:25:56,584
[SPEAKER_00]: Macman has been writing in quite a bit.

279
00:25:57,555 --> 00:26:00,136
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I've gotten more from Actman than I have from Rob.

280
00:26:00,357 --> 00:26:01,557
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think he's written in at all.

281
00:26:01,577 --> 00:26:03,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe he's on vacation for the holidays.

282
00:26:03,238 --> 00:26:04,299
[SPEAKER_06]: He needs to write.

283
00:26:04,399 --> 00:26:05,859
[SPEAKER_06]: I keep thinking of Mathman.

284
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember Square One Teeth?

285
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:07,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Forget it.

286
00:26:08,281 --> 00:26:08,581
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

287
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:09,221
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

288
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:10,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Nerd++!

289
00:26:10,882 --> 00:26:11,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anyway.

290
00:26:11,882 --> 00:26:12,903
[SPEAKER_00]: You have gained a level.

291
00:26:12,983 --> 00:26:14,164
[SPEAKER_00]: Minus one charisma.

292
00:26:14,184 --> 00:26:14,944
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, anyway.

293
00:26:14,964 --> 00:26:16,165
[SPEAKER_00]: Minus one INT.

294
00:26:16,185 --> 00:26:16,985
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, shut up.

295
00:26:17,045 --> 00:26:17,465
[SPEAKER_00]: Be better.

296
00:26:18,986 --> 00:26:21,407
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to quote, and I actually cc'd you on this email.

297
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:24,109
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Loki, of course, whatever you want to say about Max, go ahead.

298
00:26:24,169 --> 00:26:25,169
[SPEAKER_00]: Make my day, of course.

299
00:26:25,569 --> 00:26:26,510
[SPEAKER_00]: You were looking at porn.

300
00:26:27,597 --> 00:26:29,619
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the few fun things to do on a PC.

301
00:26:29,899 --> 00:26:30,179
[SPEAKER_00]: Zing!

302
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:31,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, snap.

303
00:26:32,501 --> 00:26:33,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, darn.

304
00:26:33,082 --> 00:26:34,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you couldn't do that on a Mac.

305
00:26:34,563 --> 00:26:38,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

306
00:26:38,747 --> 00:26:43,811
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't like Macs because they're cookie-cutter PCs, as I like to call them.

307
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:50,457
[SPEAKER_06]: That's because you... Just, this debate is... This debate is so 2005.

308
00:26:50,497 --> 00:26:51,137
[SPEAKER_06]: This is so 2005.

309
00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:51,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

310
00:26:52,138 --> 00:26:52,579
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

311
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,161
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, Krispy Kreme-y.

312
00:26:55,762 --> 00:26:58,943
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's one of our newest people on our website.

313
00:26:58,983 --> 00:26:59,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Donut.

314
00:26:59,984 --> 00:27:00,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheesecake donut.

315
00:27:01,844 --> 00:27:02,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Fattening donut.

316
00:27:02,505 --> 00:27:02,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

317
00:27:03,985 --> 00:27:08,027
[SPEAKER_00]: Said that our mention on the podcast was so cool that he ran upstairs and told his parents.

318
00:27:10,348 --> 00:27:11,348
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what to think of that.

319
00:27:11,408 --> 00:27:17,531
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad that parents are involved with what their kids are listening to because this show may not be appropriate for everyone.

320
00:27:17,891 --> 00:27:23,553
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think it's very cool that he's looking forward to the same game I'm looking forward to.

321
00:27:23,773 --> 00:27:24,093
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?

322
00:27:25,234 --> 00:27:25,614
[SPEAKER_00]: We will

323
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:27,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, oh, okay.

324
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:28,320
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I see.

325
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that game.

326
00:27:29,521 --> 00:27:29,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, okay.

327
00:27:31,703 --> 00:27:33,605
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that special game where you do stuff.

328
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:35,066
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.

329
00:27:35,146 --> 00:27:36,407
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the stuff game.

330
00:27:37,768 --> 00:27:38,149
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever.

331
00:27:38,709 --> 00:27:40,651
[SPEAKER_00]: We got an email from Delta One.

332
00:27:40,851 --> 00:27:41,512
[SPEAKER_00]: He's actually a

333
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:49,472
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to say, pretty insightful as far as the... Okay, where'd the ferret go?

334
00:27:50,433 --> 00:27:51,633
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't resist.

335
00:27:51,854 --> 00:27:53,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Suddenly I'm thinking of StarFox.

336
00:27:54,235 --> 00:27:55,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I say StarFox?

337
00:27:56,237 --> 00:27:57,417
[SPEAKER_00]: You got that from me.

338
00:27:57,437 --> 00:27:58,518
[SPEAKER_06]: StarFox.

339
00:27:58,838 --> 00:28:00,239
[SPEAKER_06]: The old game, StarFox.

340
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,802
[SPEAKER_00]: On the way up here, I asked, I am Robin, asked if you wanted anything from StarFox.

341
00:28:04,923 --> 00:28:06,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Vodka and OJ, ladies and gentlemen.

342
00:28:06,604 --> 00:28:07,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, I was thinking of StarFox.

343
00:28:07,945 --> 00:28:08,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

344
00:28:10,686 --> 00:28:12,987
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking Star Fox because I watched Symphomy.

345
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:14,688
[SPEAKER_06]: She said Star Fox.

346
00:28:15,708 --> 00:28:18,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, we're going to get that explicit tag if you're not careful.

347
00:28:18,629 --> 00:28:19,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop using that F-bomb.

348
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:20,130
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

349
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:20,650
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

350
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:25,472
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, you mentioned briefly in your last podcast that the region coding for Japan and the U.S.

351
00:28:25,492 --> 00:28:27,152
[SPEAKER_00]: will be the same with Blu-ray technology.

352
00:28:27,592 --> 00:28:30,013
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know if this means imported Japanese games will play on U.S.

353
00:28:30,033 --> 00:28:32,694
[SPEAKER_00]: systems and vice versa, or does it only apply to movies?

354
00:28:33,154 --> 00:28:34,595
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, and I enjoy the podcast.

355
00:28:35,403 --> 00:28:38,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, actually, it will mean that both games will play on the same systems.

356
00:28:38,786 --> 00:28:45,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, they probably won't put English language in there, so you're kind of screwed in that sense, but yeah, you will be able to.

357
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:54,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Couldn't, well, but couldn't they do, because we don't really know what PS3 is all about yet, couldn't we see some type of Sony-enabled protection?

358
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:56,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do you think they really care?

359
00:29:20,115 --> 00:29:29,827
[SPEAKER_00]: No, actually Europe and Africa are sharing a region code, so they will not be able to play any of the American or Japanese games.

360
00:29:29,847 --> 00:29:31,810
[SPEAKER_06]: But that makes sense because they're TVs, right?

361
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:33,812
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, they're PAL.

362
00:29:34,093 --> 00:29:35,735
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't matter if you have an HDTV.

363
00:29:36,243 --> 00:29:37,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.

364
00:29:37,383 --> 00:29:38,904
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a computer monitor.

365
00:29:39,264 --> 00:29:42,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Not everybody's going to be on HDTV for five years at least.

366
00:29:42,205 --> 00:29:58,972
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking, though, by this next generation of gaming, we are going to start getting to one unified format for the entire world, which would be nice, because then we'd be able to get the games released at the same time instead of waiting, I don't know, six months to release Katamari Damacy, you know, We Love Katamari or whatever.

367
00:30:00,835 --> 00:30:29,276
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's going to be until we get to like Playstation 4 and that whole gen of games and whatever else decides to come out around then until we start seeing the more like mandatory HD and all that stuff that you guys talk about but that's years and years away assuming there's not another video game crash as some people are predicting actually they're talking about boom in the market so yeah apparently the arcade market's picked up a bit yeah I don't really just from some of the things I've been hearing you know Sega's getting back into into some of that too

368
00:30:30,049 --> 00:30:32,731
[SPEAKER_06]: God bless Sega for showing some love to the arcade.

369
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:36,114
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, you know what we need is Planet Harrier on something at home.

370
00:30:36,314 --> 00:30:36,734
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

371
00:30:37,755 --> 00:30:38,996
[SPEAKER_00]: I freaking love Planet Harrier.

372
00:30:39,416 --> 00:30:40,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other letters for us this week?

373
00:30:40,978 --> 00:30:46,442
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I actually basically replied the same and got a pretty excited response from that.

374
00:30:46,542 --> 00:30:46,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Right on.

375
00:30:47,383 --> 00:30:52,767
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we have an email from one of our long-term fans, AsianBuddyPaul.com.

376
00:30:53,311 --> 00:30:54,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, sir.

377
00:30:54,491 --> 00:30:54,991
[SPEAKER_06]: How's he doing?

378
00:30:55,051 --> 00:30:59,112
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to quote this letter, Happy New Year, Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki.

379
00:30:59,432 --> 00:31:03,553
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wanted to wish you guys another great year of awesome podcasts and memorable live shows.

380
00:31:04,214 --> 00:31:07,514
[SPEAKER_00]: I have good feelings about 2006 for gaming and everything in general.

381
00:31:08,274 --> 00:31:09,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh, the announcement.

382
00:31:10,575 --> 00:31:11,735
[SPEAKER_06]: I totally forgot.

383
00:31:11,755 --> 00:31:13,756
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, wait, wait, wait.

384
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:15,336
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more.

385
00:31:15,436 --> 00:31:18,777
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is a quote on here for PS3 Revolution Year of the Dog.

386
00:31:18,817 --> 00:31:19,397
[SPEAKER_00]: Dogs are lucky.

387
00:31:21,394 --> 00:31:22,535
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was pretty nice.

388
00:31:44,663 --> 00:31:49,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Both shows will actually be taped live Sunday nights on our station.

389
00:31:50,287 --> 00:31:52,949
[SPEAKER_06]: We're kind of fusing the two shows we have together right now.

390
00:31:52,989 --> 00:32:00,655
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to fuse those shows together so that you, the listener, can actually participate more in our show by calling in, being in our chat room.

391
00:32:01,095 --> 00:32:01,876
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be awesome.

392
00:32:01,896 --> 00:32:06,920
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to have a whole new level of listener interactivity that's going to go into our podcast.

393
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,282
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're going to hear a lot of those changes starting on the 15th.

394
00:32:09,882 --> 00:32:10,723
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's going to be a good time.

395
00:32:10,763 --> 00:32:11,783
[SPEAKER_06]: So stay tuned for that.

396
00:32:11,823 --> 00:32:13,745
[SPEAKER_06]: More information available on OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

397
00:32:13,945 --> 00:32:21,411
[SPEAKER_00]: We also did get another email from MacMan about having trouble using our site to get into the IRC chatroom.

398
00:32:21,431 --> 00:32:22,532
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh-oh.

399
00:32:22,772 --> 00:32:29,217
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, you know, it goes hand-in-hand with what you're saying about us having that interactive level with our listeners.

400
00:32:29,738 --> 00:32:33,881
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm thinking maybe we should look into having some sort of Mac-related...

401
00:32:34,241 --> 00:32:35,483
[SPEAKER_00]: Link off of our website.

402
00:32:50,221 --> 00:32:52,962
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have any... Well, I know Java would work on any system, but okay.

403
00:32:53,202 --> 00:32:54,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, whatever.

404
00:32:54,303 --> 00:33:03,926
[SPEAKER_06]: With any IRC client, hypothetically, you should be able to connect to any other side IRC as the network, other side IRC, and our chat room is Pound Orange Lounge.

405
00:33:03,946 --> 00:33:08,688
[SPEAKER_06]: But I warn you guys, outside of our live shows, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday nights, it's...

406
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:10,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Not too active.

407
00:33:10,628 --> 00:33:11,709
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of on the dead side.

408
00:33:11,749 --> 00:33:19,071
[SPEAKER_06]: But once in a while we do have our regulars who keep an eye on things and who are policing things that will talk to you if they're there.

409
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:21,711
[SPEAKER_04]: It is more active, though, in our forums.

410
00:33:22,491 --> 00:33:22,892
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

411
00:33:23,012 --> 00:33:23,352
[SPEAKER_06]: The forums.

412
00:33:23,932 --> 00:33:32,654
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you sort of want to get an idea of what things are like in our chat room, if you go onto our forums and look at the quote thread under our random chatter, get an idea.

413
00:33:33,074 --> 00:33:33,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Such randomness.

414
00:33:34,295 --> 00:33:34,615
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes.

415
00:33:35,015 --> 00:33:35,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else in our mailbox?

416
00:33:37,608 --> 00:33:40,209
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

417
00:34:03,424 --> 00:34:21,398
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I forgot something, but apparently, if you actually try to put in a gamertag that's already been used, like, for example, you'll get a message that says, if you believe someone else has registered with your gamertag, please send an email to support at xboxdiamond.com.

418
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:28,924
[SPEAKER_04]: The only problem is that it's actually xboxdiamondcard.com, not xboxdiamond.

419
00:34:29,364 --> 00:34:30,865
[SPEAKER_04]: xboxdiamond is owned by another...

420
00:34:32,162 --> 00:34:33,082
[SPEAKER_04]: and Cybersquatter.

421
00:34:33,422 --> 00:34:33,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh oh.

422
00:34:34,222 --> 00:34:38,583
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you send an email there, you're going to be sending all your personal information to God knows who.

423
00:34:39,363 --> 00:34:39,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Yikes.

424
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:41,904
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've got to watch out for that kind of stuff.

425
00:34:42,344 --> 00:34:51,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently the domain has been changing hands on eBay because I guess they figured out that the Diamond Card thing was going to be coming out.

426
00:34:52,686 --> 00:34:53,066
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

427
00:34:53,306 --> 00:34:57,346
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just basically watch where you're sending your stuff to.

428
00:34:57,766 --> 00:35:00,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely check the URLs if it's not something that you know

429
00:35:01,471 --> 00:35:02,393
[SPEAKER_04]: is part of the site.

430
00:35:03,194 --> 00:35:04,797
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably don't send an email to it.

431
00:35:05,822 --> 00:35:07,763
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, more news going on.

432
00:35:08,303 --> 00:35:10,023
[SPEAKER_06]: One other quick Xbox 360 related story.

433
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:15,384
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it's a little bit redundant because we talked about this game a lot, but I just want to confirm for you guys, Dead or Alive 4 did come out.

434
00:35:15,765 --> 00:35:18,685
[SPEAKER_06]: December 29th is when it shipped, hitting the streets December 30th.

435
00:35:19,065 --> 00:35:20,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, what the hell happened?

436
00:35:20,106 --> 00:35:21,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Why didn't it come out January 2nd?

437
00:35:21,946 --> 00:35:22,906
[SPEAKER_06]: How did they make it out early?

438
00:35:23,286 --> 00:35:29,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the whole thing was is actually, I guess they pushed ahead their shipment.

439
00:35:29,248 --> 00:35:33,309
[SPEAKER_04]: They kind of were overestimating when they were going to have the game out.

440
00:35:33,949 --> 00:35:38,074
[SPEAKER_04]: and they were able to finish it before that and so they were releasing before that.

441
00:35:38,475 --> 00:35:47,265
[SPEAKER_04]: They were basically all they were doing was really tweaking online stuff and once that was all done they pressed it and it went gold and got it out a couple days beforehand.

442
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:50,409
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean they only really did get it out one day before because

443
00:35:51,087 --> 00:35:51,728
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

444
00:36:11,513 --> 00:36:22,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of most anticipated games, we were talking last week about our favorite games of 2005, and now this week I'd like to ask you guys, what is your most anticipated game of 2006?

445
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:25,800
[SPEAKER_06]: What game are you looking forward to, and why?

446
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:26,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, start us off.

447
00:36:28,081 --> 00:36:30,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, there is so much good stuff.

448
00:36:30,602 --> 00:36:31,322
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta pick one.

449
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:33,600
[SPEAKER_04]: PS3, PS4, PS5, PS6

450
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:57,700
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Kingdom Hearts 2

451
00:37:19,282 --> 00:37:20,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, of course.

452
00:37:20,763 --> 00:37:24,945
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so tough because this is a really good gaming year, honestly.

453
00:37:25,965 --> 00:37:29,167
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about the Steamboat Willie level and Tron.

454
00:37:29,427 --> 00:37:30,747
[SPEAKER_00]: Light Cycles, hello!

455
00:37:30,767 --> 00:37:32,608
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think about what you've seen of the Japanese version?

456
00:37:32,628 --> 00:37:34,009
[SPEAKER_06]: We see more and more of it hitting the internet.

457
00:37:34,069 --> 00:37:35,290
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen quite a bit.

458
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:38,771
[SPEAKER_00]: I still want Aerith to die again.

459
00:37:39,952 --> 00:37:44,674
[SPEAKER_00]: But having a... Having a...

460
00:37:46,286 --> 00:37:47,888
[SPEAKER_00]: More Cloud is always nice.

461
00:37:47,948 --> 00:37:51,210
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's actually, it's actually, I don't know if you noticed his outfit.

462
00:37:52,091 --> 00:37:57,294
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually Advent Children Cloud.

463
00:37:57,715 --> 00:37:58,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, very cool.

464
00:37:58,595 --> 00:38:05,920
[SPEAKER_04]: See, this is why I want a new Super Mario RPG because they've done it so well with Disney and Square.

465
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:08,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Why the hell can't they do it with Square and Nintendo?

466
00:38:10,183 --> 00:38:12,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just, they've done it so well.

467
00:38:12,285 --> 00:38:14,787
[SPEAKER_04]: They've really refined the whole RPG thing.

468
00:38:14,967 --> 00:38:15,247
[SPEAKER_06]: It's awesome.

469
00:38:15,984 --> 00:38:18,586
[SPEAKER_06]: P. Diddy said it best, it's all about the Benjamins.

470
00:38:46,923 --> 00:38:47,984
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure about that game.

471
00:38:48,224 --> 00:38:49,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Guardian Hero.

472
00:38:49,464 --> 00:38:51,665
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of under the radar.

473
00:38:51,685 --> 00:38:52,045
[SPEAKER_06]: It came out in 2004.

474
00:38:52,085 --> 00:38:56,827
[SPEAKER_06]: You said Guardian Heroes, so I don't know about that.

475
00:38:56,888 --> 00:38:58,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Now Guardian Heroes on the Saturn.

476
00:38:58,548 --> 00:39:01,109
[SPEAKER_00]: Guardian Heroes is freaking sexy, and I have that game.

477
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:03,691
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, you want to know what?

478
00:39:03,791 --> 00:39:04,671
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

479
00:39:04,811 --> 00:39:07,192
[SPEAKER_00]: If I am correct, I think it already did get a sequel in Japan.

480
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:11,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of these technically had sequels.

481
00:39:11,394 --> 00:39:13,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Another one on this list here is Chrono Trigger.

482
00:39:14,215 --> 00:39:14,655
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Chrono Cross.

483
00:39:14,675 --> 00:39:18,277
[SPEAKER_06]: But they say that the sequel wasn't really the game.

484
00:39:18,297 --> 00:39:18,777
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

485
00:39:18,797 --> 00:39:19,317
[SPEAKER_00]: That it was.

486
00:39:19,597 --> 00:39:23,278
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, but... Chrono Cross was a true sequel.

487
00:39:23,619 --> 00:39:25,799
[SPEAKER_06]: For the purpose of this article, they're calling it a spinoff.

488
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,460
[SPEAKER_06]: But I know, it's a gray area.

489
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,000
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a gray area.

490
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, let's see.

491
00:39:29,841 --> 00:39:30,861
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Kid Icarus.

492
00:39:31,482 --> 00:39:32,462
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a popular choice.

493
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:33,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely.

494
00:39:33,682 --> 00:39:34,623
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a no-brainer.

495
00:39:35,949 --> 00:39:38,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Comics Zone on the Genesis.

496
00:39:39,193 --> 00:39:40,674
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.

497
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:43,356
[SPEAKER_06]: That's that mandatory WTF pick.

498
00:39:43,717 --> 00:39:44,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Skies of Arcadia.

499
00:39:46,299 --> 00:39:46,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

500
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Sonic CD.

501
00:39:48,922 --> 00:39:49,262
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

502
00:39:49,442 --> 00:39:49,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

503
00:39:50,003 --> 00:39:50,703
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God.

504
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:51,164
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.

505
00:39:51,204 --> 00:39:52,345
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the Japanese music.

506
00:39:53,006 --> 00:39:57,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Grim Fandango, which is another one of those kind of, I never really played it.

507
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:58,110
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's one.

508
00:39:58,391 --> 00:39:59,031
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with this.

509
00:39:59,332 --> 00:40:00,553
[SPEAKER_06]: American McGee's Alice.

510
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:03,799
[SPEAKER_06]: We need more games in the Fantasy Zone series!

511
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:37,173
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to see another game in the Mega Man Legends series because I really like those games and I think they're pretty solid RPGs for the Mega Man series.

512
00:40:59,608 --> 00:41:01,889
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

513
00:41:22,338 --> 00:41:29,901
[SPEAKER_06]: A little piece of advice, because, you know, if we just sat around and played video games all day long, we would have no time to come up with new lists.

514
00:41:31,742 --> 00:41:32,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

515
00:41:32,542 --> 00:41:35,644
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, here is DarkSakura with her advice column.

516
00:41:35,664 --> 00:41:41,686
[SPEAKER_06]: And DarkSakura, what are you going to tell all the kids out there on Orange Lounge Radio Land about this week?

517
00:41:43,187 --> 00:41:46,788
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's piece of advice is something very important in the post-holiday time.

518
00:41:46,988 --> 00:41:47,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes?

519
00:41:47,629 --> 00:41:49,249
[SPEAKER_00]: How to untangle Christmas tree lights.

520
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:50,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, this is a good one.

521
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:50,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

522
00:41:51,832 --> 00:41:52,412
[SPEAKER_00]: Number 1.

523
00:41:52,833 --> 00:41:54,294
[SPEAKER_00]: Unplug all connected strands.

524
00:41:54,514 --> 00:41:59,658
[SPEAKER_00]: Unplug all strands so your tangle is one containing several knotted sections, not one long knotted strand.

525
00:42:00,118 --> 00:42:01,979
[SPEAKER_00]: The shorter the strands, the less complex the knots.

526
00:42:02,359 --> 00:42:03,860
[SPEAKER_00]: Duh.

527
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:03,860
2.

528
00:42:04,261 --> 00:42:05,141
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a free end.

529
00:42:05,502 --> 00:42:06,923
[SPEAKER_00]: Double duh.

530
00:42:06,963 --> 00:42:06,923
3.

531
00:42:07,123 --> 00:42:08,203
[SPEAKER_00]: Loosen all the knots.

532
00:42:08,844 --> 00:42:13,247
[SPEAKER_00]: When the knots are all loose, create a hole through the tangle where free end leaves the mass.

533
00:42:14,208 --> 00:42:13,247
4.

534
00:42:14,648 --> 00:42:17,150
[SPEAKER_00]: Roll or wind the free end through each knot in the tangle.

535
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:19,391
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat the strands gently to avoid breaking the bolts. 5.

536
00:42:20,982 --> 00:42:22,583
[SPEAKER_00]: Untie each successive knot.

537
00:42:22,943 --> 00:42:27,226
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the free end rolled to make it easier to work with and reduce the amount of cord to pull through.

538
00:42:28,106 --> 00:42:30,247
[SPEAKER_00]: Six, keep the free end under control.

539
00:42:30,427 --> 00:42:31,568
[SPEAKER_00]: Never pull on the free end.

540
00:42:31,648 --> 00:42:32,969
[SPEAKER_00]: Pulling will tighten the tangle.

541
00:42:33,369 --> 00:42:35,490
[SPEAKER_00]: The knot-free section should continue to get longer.

542
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:37,191
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven, repeat as necessary.

543
00:42:37,691 --> 00:42:40,413
[SPEAKER_00]: But my final piece of advice... Use candles?

544
00:42:42,174 --> 00:42:42,734
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

545
00:42:43,054 --> 00:42:43,275
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

546
00:42:43,815 --> 00:42:45,476
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than you celebrate Hanukkah, I don't know.

547
00:42:46,616 --> 00:42:49,937
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, my final piece of advice is just don't let him get tangled in the first place.

548
00:42:49,997 --> 00:42:51,138
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that hard.

549
00:42:54,058 --> 00:42:54,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop being lazy.

550
00:42:56,279 --> 00:42:57,299
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my final piece of advice.

551
00:42:57,339 --> 00:42:58,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop being lazy.

552
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:10,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Rumors abound that the new World of Warcraft race has been revealed by the February issue of Computer Gaming saying that the new race will be the... And forgive me if I pronounce this wrong.

553
00:43:11,304 --> 00:43:11,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Draenei?

554
00:43:12,938 --> 00:43:18,482
[SPEAKER_06]: D-R-A-E-N-E-I, I've been three weeks without World of Warcraft and I've been drinking tonight, so forgive me.

555
00:43:18,783 --> 00:43:20,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Dry-ni, something like that, dry-ni?

556
00:43:20,804 --> 00:43:23,366
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that's exactly how it's pronounced, but anyways.

557
00:43:24,447 --> 00:43:25,007
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

558
00:43:25,047 --> 00:43:25,528
[SPEAKER_04]: I get you.

559
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,169
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically this.

560
00:43:27,389 --> 00:43:31,092
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, I'm sure you've seen this on most of the gaming websites out there anyway.

561
00:43:31,152 --> 00:43:33,133
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just kind of beating a dead horse here, but...

562
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:35,028
[SPEAKER_06]: But what do we think?

563
00:43:35,068 --> 00:43:36,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this actually legit or what?

564
00:43:37,029 --> 00:43:52,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, first off, let me add that Computer Gaming Magazine has come out and said that this source is not official, but it is basically a highly rumored source that this is what the next alliance race is going to be.

565
00:43:52,933 --> 00:43:58,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I'd like to add my coworker, who is a huge World of Warcraft fan, says that a lot of the...

566
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:04,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Storylines point that this is going to be the next likely race that's going to be for the Alliance.

567
00:44:05,741 --> 00:44:08,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because they're trying to balance the Alliance and horde races.

568
00:44:09,045 --> 00:44:10,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the Alliance needs some ugly people.

569
00:44:10,866 --> 00:44:12,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

570
00:44:13,469 --> 00:44:15,090
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, any thoughts on this?

571
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:18,153
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't played any World of Warcraft in months and I still need to renew my account.

572
00:44:19,054 --> 00:44:21,537
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish the Pandaren rumors were more true.

573
00:44:21,877 --> 00:44:23,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, the Chinese are a bitter race.

574
00:44:27,335 --> 00:44:29,176
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

575
00:44:56,175 --> 00:44:58,436
[SPEAKER_00]: Legends for PC by Ubisoft.

576
00:44:59,417 --> 00:45:06,962
[SPEAKER_00]: Then three games that are all the same for Xbox, PC, PS2, Rugby Challenge 2006, because it's all about men getting each other bloody.

577
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:11,244
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I don't think that game's going to have any blood, so darn.

578
00:45:12,765 --> 00:45:15,086
[SPEAKER_00]: 31st, Top Spin for Game Boy Advance.

579
00:45:16,027 --> 00:45:23,772
[SPEAKER_00]: Other games that are undated, we have Dragon Ball Z Supersonic Warriors 2, Sega Classics Collection, which is actually a pretty good collection.

580
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:29,226
[SPEAKER_00]: Space Invaders Evolution, and drumroll, we love Katamari.

581
00:45:29,246 --> 00:45:31,269
[SPEAKER_04]: About time, you guys.

582
00:45:31,309 --> 00:45:32,030
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously.

583
00:45:32,748 --> 00:45:36,290
[SPEAKER_04]: The US isn't getting too much as far as January releases.

584
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:48,916
[SPEAKER_04]: The big ones being 25 to Life, which I believe is coming out the third week in January, as well as MVP 06 NCAA Baseball, College Baseball.

585
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the two big games for the month.

586
00:45:51,978 --> 00:45:57,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Painkiller Hell Wars is still to be announced because it's been shifting hands from Atari to 2K Games.

587
00:45:58,562 --> 00:46:02,487
[SPEAKER_04]: and a lot more stuff to come in February, including my favorite, Full Auto.

588
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:07,574
[SPEAKER_06]: UK and US release dates for your gaming pleasure.

589
00:46:07,654 --> 00:46:10,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we're winding down here, but first off...

590
00:46:10,948 --> 00:46:12,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, what's this about?

591
00:46:12,829 --> 00:46:13,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Some cheat thing?

592
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:15,931
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's a cheat, I know you found it.

593
00:46:15,971 --> 00:46:17,432
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell's going on here with Liberty City Stories?

594
00:46:17,452 --> 00:46:20,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Liberty City Stories, they have this nice cheat program.

595
00:46:20,534 --> 00:46:24,996
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually a modified save game that you use as a trainer.

596
00:46:25,096 --> 00:46:27,938
[SPEAKER_04]: And you actually have a bunch of different cheats you can toggle on and off.

597
00:46:28,979 --> 00:46:33,381
[SPEAKER_04]: This right here is basically what I play when I'm sitting at home.

598
00:46:33,441 --> 00:46:39,545
[SPEAKER_04]: You can actually, some of the cheats that they've created so far, Unlimited Health, Heavy Motorcycles, which is my favorite.

599
00:46:39,895 --> 00:46:40,756
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

600
00:47:02,392 --> 00:47:03,273
[SPEAKER_04]: All these different things.

601
00:47:03,373 --> 00:47:06,055
[SPEAKER_04]: And that kind of opens a huge door to homebrew stuff.

602
00:47:06,375 --> 00:47:14,060
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you haven't gotten it already, if you already have Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, I highly recommend that you download this cheat program for Liberty City.

603
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,221
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a save file.

604
00:47:15,281 --> 00:47:15,902
[SPEAKER_04]: You load it up.

605
00:47:16,522 --> 00:47:17,763
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of fun to play with.

606
00:47:19,584 --> 00:47:20,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, sounds good.

607
00:47:20,105 --> 00:47:21,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you got for us tonight, Loki?

608
00:47:22,849 --> 00:47:25,753
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing I have tonight is actually kind of a rumor.

609
00:47:26,173 --> 00:47:30,639
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically this thing that Nintendo's kind of trademarked.

610
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:32,642
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Nintendo Floor Vision.

611
00:47:33,443 --> 00:47:37,889
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of people are kind of wondering what the hell is Nintendo Floor Vision.

612
00:47:38,289 --> 00:47:42,670
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously the first thing that comes to mind is, hmm, maybe it's something that has to do with the revolution.

613
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:47,391
[SPEAKER_04]: And hmm, maybe it's something that has to do with the revolution being, I don't know, stereoscopic 3D.

614
00:47:48,331 --> 00:47:58,734
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things that they think on Joystick.com is that it's actually kind of something that we saw at like E3, one of those kind of LCD panels where you can step on it and interact with it.

615
00:47:59,074 --> 00:48:01,195
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

616
00:48:25,865 --> 00:48:27,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Pong Movie in Development

617
00:48:47,726 --> 00:48:54,972
[SPEAKER_06]: I... It is supposedly written by Stephen E. D'Souza, who's writing Tomb Raider... I'm sorry, who wrote... Oh, bullshit!

618
00:48:55,012 --> 00:48:55,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Lord from Tomb Raider.

619
00:48:56,853 --> 00:49:00,216
[SPEAKER_06]: I... Huge grain of salt with this one, kids.

620
00:49:00,296 --> 00:49:02,818
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, um... I know, there's just...

621
00:49:04,173 --> 00:49:04,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey!

622
00:49:04,353 --> 00:49:07,254
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll say what, if you believe in the Pong movie, I've got some igloos to sell you.

623
00:49:07,334 --> 00:49:07,354
[SPEAKER_06]: I...

624
00:49:23,692 --> 00:49:25,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Huge grain of salt with this.

625
00:49:25,213 --> 00:49:30,075
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not exactly going to comment on whether this is a good or bad thing because I don't think it's real.

626
00:49:30,095 --> 00:49:30,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me put it this way.

627
00:49:31,056 --> 00:49:35,498
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be able to believe it a little bit more if it had Ui Bo attached to it.

628
00:49:36,078 --> 00:49:42,982
[SPEAKER_04]: But since it doesn't, I'm going to have the call that this is really stupid and a dumb attempt to make a joke about a movie.

629
00:49:43,362 --> 00:49:46,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if it really comes out, you're going to look like an ass.

630
00:49:46,664 --> 00:49:47,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

631
00:49:47,364 --> 00:49:53,227
[SPEAKER_04]: However, though, I do have to say, though, since they did announce that Pac-Man, the movie, is actually going to happen...

632
00:49:54,329 --> 00:49:56,750
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm about to believe anything you write about that.

633
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:57,631
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Pac-Man the cartoon.

634
00:49:57,671 --> 00:49:58,431
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes sense to me.

635
00:49:59,612 --> 00:50:01,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Why the fuck do they need Pac-Man the movie?

636
00:50:02,233 --> 00:50:05,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, we had Pac-Man Fever, the song.

637
00:50:05,575 --> 00:50:06,235
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had it all.

638
00:50:06,275 --> 00:50:09,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen, they said that it might not even be a CG movie.

639
00:50:09,397 --> 00:50:10,537
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be live action.

640
00:50:10,637 --> 00:50:11,598
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be stupid.

641
00:50:12,038 --> 00:50:12,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

642
00:50:13,059 --> 00:50:13,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Stupid.

643
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:15,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen, people.

644
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, you're worried about, you're wondering why.

645
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:18,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm, people are not going to see.

646
00:50:19,422 --> 00:50:21,603
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be like puppets, like Team America World Police.

647
00:50:23,024 --> 00:50:23,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Forget it.

648
00:50:24,275 --> 00:50:25,916
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be stupid no matter what you do.

649
00:50:25,936 --> 00:50:29,497
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say we're going to wrap it up here with our final thoughts.

650
00:50:29,557 --> 00:50:29,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

651
00:50:30,537 --> 00:50:35,098
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is I have 13 shots in me and I'm doing good.

652
00:50:35,998 --> 00:50:41,100
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is I'm feeling much better and I think I'm going to get a little bit of food now.

653
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,160
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

654
00:50:44,481 --> 00:50:48,262
[SPEAKER_01]: As usual, reject false icons and stop watching TV.

655
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:50,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and I have one little thing to add.

656
00:50:51,306 --> 00:50:56,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox Live, if you do have an Xbox 360, a lot of cool demos that they've added lately.

657
00:50:56,488 --> 00:50:59,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Condemned and Quake 4, definitely check those out.

658
00:50:59,809 --> 00:51:03,250
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a really good thing to be able to check these games out before you actually buy them.

659
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:04,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, show's over.

660
00:51:04,551 --> 00:51:04,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

661
00:51:04,971 --> 00:51:05,211
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

662
00:51:05,831 --> 00:51:06,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one.

663
00:51:06,832 --> 00:51:08,692
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you next week here on Orange Ledger.

664
00:51:09,113 --> 00:51:16,715
[SPEAKER_06]: The last week of our regular, or I guess I should say old podcast, and then we're going into the twice a week starting January 15th.

665
00:51:17,196 --> 00:51:17,956
[SPEAKER_06]: So check that out.
