And now, the conclusion of episode 170 for January 15th, 2006.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. Thank you for joining us here on the second half of our show.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
And, of course, we had a pretty exciting first half there.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.600
first half there we talked to freeze pop we were doing a list there the top 100

00:30.600 --> 00:34.280
games some list there in the UK now we're gonna get to a story I know a lot

00:34.280 --> 00:37.880
of you guys are very eager to hear about because we have a lot of listeners that

00:37.880 --> 00:43.520
have stuck with us through the music gaming focus mm-hmm I thought we were

00:43.520 --> 00:47.520
talking about Oregon Trail the MMO no that was that was last month so that

00:47.520 --> 00:51.160
that jokes getting smoldy there just kidding I know we're gonna talk about

00:51.160 --> 00:55.040
DDR supernova dance dance revolution supernova love it or hate it because I

00:55.040 --> 00:58.480
I know we have both types of people listening to the podcast, Dance Dance Revolution is

00:58.480 --> 01:03.120
making a comeback and it's called Dance Dance Revolution Supernova.

01:03.120 --> 01:05.880
It was announced on ddrfreak.com this week.

01:05.880 --> 01:10.740
Bets and Enterprises is distributing it, although it's assumed that Konami is actually making

01:10.740 --> 01:11.740
the game.

01:11.740 --> 01:16.800
We don't know a lot outside of that, except for a logo that was also posted on ddrfreak

01:16.800 --> 01:20.240
in the forums, the little red and black looking logo.

01:20.240 --> 01:21.240
Should be very interesting.

01:21.240 --> 01:26.560
I should also point out, most of the previous arcade versions of DDR that you've played

01:26.560 --> 01:31.740
were actually quote-unquote illegal machines from Japan.

01:31.740 --> 01:34.980
And DDR shouldn't be confused with the other arcade dancing game, In the Groove, that's

01:34.980 --> 01:37.380
a whole other story.

01:37.380 --> 01:43.180
But we haven't had a US release in the arcades of a DDR game since DDR USA Mix, which was

01:43.180 --> 01:48.260
like, I want to say 98, 99, it was a long time ago.

01:48.260 --> 01:52.620
So this one is being made in the US, it's not being made for Japanese release, or we

01:52.620 --> 01:55.780
don't really know the full specifics on that, but we do know it's definitely coming out

01:55.780 --> 01:57.020
for USA.

01:57.020 --> 02:00.860
What do you guys think as long-time DDR fans, because I know y'all are, because Orange

02:00.860 --> 02:04.700
Honors Radio started as kind of a music game station, what do you think?

02:04.700 --> 02:06.780
Loki, is this something you're excited about?

02:06.780 --> 02:11.860
It took them a long time to start over, I guess, but it should be interesting, might

02:11.860 --> 02:17.140
get me back in the plane again, I just have to see how it is, because it could suck.

02:17.140 --> 02:18.140
That's the whole thing.

02:18.140 --> 02:23.940
gotta be they've got a second chance to do something right and they better not

02:23.940 --> 02:28.980
screw it up dark Sakura my sentiments exactly except I've just been sort of

02:28.980 --> 02:36.380
like Oh DDR is it too late to save you to bring you back into the DRL no when

02:36.380 --> 02:40.260
it's out I'll be excited but right now because I don't know anything about it

02:40.260 --> 02:45.820
and I just like I'm hoping it's not too little too late it's got to be something

02:45.820 --> 02:51.380
impressive for me to be really excited about it honestly I'm I'm having good

02:51.380 --> 02:54.940
good feelings about this I think they're gonna do a good job the whole mix is

02:54.940 --> 02:58.860
recently been pretty good there's been lots of improvements but I think Konami

02:58.860 --> 03:02.500
is kind of in tune with their fan base to an extent it depends which game we're

03:02.500 --> 03:06.700
talking about but I'm hopeful I'm hopeful that they'll come out with a

03:06.700 --> 03:10.300
large catalog of stuff I'm assuming they're gonna port stuff over from the

03:10.300 --> 03:13.500
home mixes and mix it with some new stuff so I think it'll be a fun arcade

03:13.500 --> 03:17.540
I'm just looking forward to getting back and going to the arcade in groups the

03:17.540 --> 03:20.460
one thing the one thing I'm really hoping to get out of this is more

03:20.460 --> 03:26.260
diversity in the music that'll be cool more diversity not just the same oh it's

03:26.260 --> 03:30.220
dancy but I think the u.s. mixes have done it especially like Ultramix 3 yeah

03:30.220 --> 03:36.380
that is that's a step in the right direction I think so but I don't know I

03:36.380 --> 03:39.780
try and this is just how I am anyway I tried to reserve judgment till I

03:39.780 --> 03:44.240
actually see it right all right mikle tots here by the way I know he hasn't

03:44.240 --> 03:47.100
said anything yet probably because he can't because he's afraid he actually

03:47.100 --> 03:52.260
works at Konami but obviously can't say a word about this or no no no not really

03:52.260 --> 03:57.140
but I can say that it sounds pretty awesome from the stuff I do know so

03:57.140 --> 04:01.980
thumbs up all right out for it and you know what the best part is though what

04:01.980 --> 04:06.920
that it's being distributed by bets in that means like Dave and Buster's can

04:06.920 --> 04:13.640
get it so you've got pump zero coming out really soon and then such and such

04:13.640 --> 04:17.780
time for supernova and when they're both there you know what that means no lines

04:17.780 --> 04:21.800
on pump zero for me is that a conflict of interest the fact that you like pump

04:21.800 --> 04:27.680
it up so much yet no everybody knows I like pump it up more than life so all

04:27.680 --> 04:31.480
right pump it up of course for those that know is the Korean dance game that

04:31.480 --> 04:35.120
has five arrows instead of four it's the one that nobody cares about anymore

04:35.120 --> 04:38.900
because all the in the groove people and all the DDR people fight so pump it up

04:38.900 --> 04:42.840
people just kind of sit back and watch and play their game. I like it but I'm

04:42.840 --> 04:45.960
not any good at it. You don't have to be good you just have to enjoy it. That's how

04:45.960 --> 04:49.760
all dancing games go. It's actually easier I think to be freestyling on. Oh yeah it

04:49.760 --> 04:59.640
feels more natural when you move. But hey, what about that DDR huh? Yeah. Yay Paul! Oh all right

04:59.640 --> 05:04.040
we're gonna go. Wait wait for our little flag. I'm sure some of the listeners want to comment on this but we

05:04.040 --> 05:07.640
We want to allow our listeners to comment on not just this, but anything we've essentially

05:07.640 --> 05:10.240
talked about through the last show here.

05:10.240 --> 05:13.400
We are opening up the Skype line for the first time on our podcast.

05:13.400 --> 05:17.560
You can either go to OrangeLoungeRadio.com and click on interact with us or you can actually

05:17.560 --> 05:21.600
give us a call as well, 916-226-9067.

05:21.600 --> 05:25.360
But please be aware that could be a toll call depending on where you're at.

05:25.360 --> 05:27.520
So ask mommy and daddy before you do that.

05:27.520 --> 05:29.260
All right, let's go to the phones.

05:29.260 --> 05:30.720
Who's going to be our very first caller?

05:30.720 --> 05:31.720
I don't know.

05:31.720 --> 05:33.440
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

05:33.440 --> 05:40.280
Are you there? Yes. Yes, who is this? This is Zander from Florida. Hi Zander from Florida. What's your mind?

05:41.600 --> 05:47.300
Am I the first? He's breaking up a little bit there. Am I the first call? Yes, you are the first call

05:47.300 --> 05:49.300
But you're breaking up pretty bad there. What's on your mind?

05:51.600 --> 05:55.560
Gosh I'm sorry about the breaking up thing. That's right. Breaking up is hard to do

05:55.560 --> 06:00.560
Yeah, I wanted to talk about the DDR thing, of course.

06:00.560 --> 06:02.560
Alright, what's on your mind about the DDR thing?

06:02.560 --> 06:05.560
Here's what I think.

06:05.560 --> 06:12.560
If it's going to work, in some way they're going to have to cater to the in-the-group audience.

06:12.560 --> 06:20.560
Like it or not, there are going to be a lot of very upset people if in-the-group dies,

06:20.560 --> 06:24.560
and this game doesn't have at least 11s, if not 12s.

06:24.560 --> 06:31.000
So, as an In The Groove fan, which I know in previous calls to this show you've said

06:31.000 --> 06:36.320
that you are, what are you looking for Konami to do to please the In The Groove fan base?

06:36.320 --> 06:41.640
Are you saying more difficult 11s and 12sies or what?

06:41.640 --> 06:47.520
More 9s and more 10s and maybe add 11s, possibly 12s, but I don't think they'd do that.

06:47.520 --> 06:50.360
I mean, I'd be kind of shocked if they add 12s.

06:50.360 --> 06:54.200
So is it just a difficulty thing for you or is there more to it?

06:54.200 --> 07:01.220
mostly it's why I quit DDR is this got boring you know can I feel that sure

07:01.220 --> 07:06.980
okay um I don't see why Konami has to cater to the in the groove audience they

07:06.980 --> 07:15.800
left them they abandoned them we don't want the back like you know go play your

07:15.800 --> 07:20.540
game that has music that sounds the same through every song and that has steps

07:20.540 --> 07:25.860
that are ridiculously hard. If that's what you find fun, go play in the groove. If you

07:25.860 --> 07:30.640
want music that sounds pretty decent and you know, might not be super hard for you, go

07:30.640 --> 07:37.640
play DDR. Listen, I'm going to come back here shockingly on the middle ground here. Now,

07:37.660 --> 07:42.940
shhh, quiet. Anyways, what I was basically going to say is Konami, what they want to

07:42.940 --> 07:46.500
do with especially a lot of these music games, they want to cater to everybody obviously.

07:46.500 --> 07:50.140
So that means, not too easy, not too hard type of stuff.

07:50.140 --> 07:52.760
Remember folks, there's always edit steps.

07:52.760 --> 07:56.260
Always have your edits that you can put on the machines, or you can make yourself.

07:56.260 --> 07:57.980
That could be any size difficulty.

07:57.980 --> 08:00.580
Yeah, but how many people actually do that?

08:00.580 --> 08:01.580
Not enough.

08:01.580 --> 08:09.100
I used to when we had a fourth mix, because god knows some of those songs were just craptastic.

08:09.100 --> 08:11.260
Remember the old hell edits?

08:11.260 --> 08:12.740
Yeah, those ones are fun.

08:12.740 --> 08:14.420
I mean, all jump rock beat.

08:14.420 --> 08:15.520
That was so much fun.

08:15.520 --> 08:17.620
Don't know if I don't know that I need them

08:17.620 --> 08:23.140
I used to make these insanely hard edits and then would challenge people and if they could beat them with a decent squad by

08:23.140 --> 08:27.060
Them dinner. Oh, that's pretty cool. All right. I want to keep it moving tonight with the calls

08:27.060 --> 08:30.100
But I definitely want to give Xander a chance to say his piece. So Xander

08:30.940 --> 08:32.940
well

08:33.060 --> 08:35.140
Okay, I think they do indicated

08:36.980 --> 08:43.940
Because I don't know just gonna be a lot of varying people they kill a groove with stupid

08:43.940 --> 08:51.320
I mean it really if they're gonna have a monopoly on the dance games then they

08:51.320 --> 08:57.880
need to cater to everybody not just mr. there that can't on one footers they

08:57.880 --> 09:01.580
are catering to everybody all difficulty levels it's the vocal

09:01.580 --> 09:05.000
minority that wants the tens and elevens you know you can have a couple of those

09:05.000 --> 09:08.420
or whatever if there are tens and elevens but you gotta remember a lot of

09:08.420 --> 09:11.720
people like sixes and sevens all right he was he was breaking up a little bit

09:11.720 --> 09:15.440
there. Zander, I gotta keep moving here but I do I do wanna kinda reiterate your

09:15.440 --> 09:17.360
point is I think I understand what you're saying is that

09:17.360 --> 09:21.520
he's saying is that you know if Konami is going to effectively block

09:21.520 --> 09:24.680
in the groove from coming out which is what it is

09:24.680 --> 09:28.040
assumably intended with this lawsuit then shouldn't they

09:28.040 --> 09:31.760
if they're gonna stomp out in the groove so to speak no pun intended

09:31.760 --> 09:34.800
shouldn't they make

09:34.800 --> 09:38.160
put in the elements that make in the groove so loved in their game

09:38.160 --> 09:41.480
I don't that that's that's what I'm hearing here elements in the group so

09:41.480 --> 09:44.080
So they got to steal someone else's intellectual copy.

09:44.080 --> 09:45.080
Oh, stop it.

09:45.080 --> 09:46.080
Stop it.

09:46.080 --> 09:47.080
All right.

09:47.080 --> 09:48.600
Xander, I want to give you a chance, though, for final words here.

09:48.600 --> 09:50.480
Um, that's about it.

09:50.480 --> 09:51.480
All right.

09:51.480 --> 09:52.480
Thanks for your call, Xander.

09:52.480 --> 09:53.480
Appreciate it.

09:53.480 --> 09:56.120
There's actually one thing that did occur to me, though, that would completely eliminate

09:56.120 --> 09:59.000
this whole 10, 11 crap.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.720
Start grading it like they do Guitar Freaks.

10:01.720 --> 10:04.240
With the numbers, like, going up to 100 and stuff like that?

10:04.240 --> 10:05.240
Yeah.

10:05.240 --> 10:06.240
Yeah.

10:06.240 --> 10:07.240
That would be pretty cool, actually.

10:07.240 --> 10:10.000
So that you have more of a broad scale to judge the difficulty by.

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
But then it brings up the point, like with Neon FM, when it was coming out, you've got

10:15.000 --> 10:19.200
a 55 and a 56, what's the difference between those two numbers?

10:19.200 --> 10:21.400
Maybe you have like a trill somewhere in the middle of the song.

10:21.400 --> 10:24.280
That would be interesting though if Konami said, you know what, screw this whole 10,

10:24.280 --> 10:28.520
11, 12 business, we'll just do a whole new rating system and F this foot thing.

10:28.520 --> 10:29.760
I guess we'll see pretty soon.

10:29.760 --> 10:34.480
Though they did try that once with the gauges, but the gauges were retarded.

10:34.480 --> 10:37.680
I think this whole scale needs to be implemented.

10:37.680 --> 10:42.040
Just a reminder for our callers on Skype, always give Echo123 a call first, and I know,

10:42.040 --> 10:45.520
you know, because he's been on the show before and it sounded just fine, but remember that

10:45.520 --> 10:48.720
you want to call Echo123 and test your connection, just to make sure, or just pick up the phone

10:48.720 --> 10:49.960
and call us.

10:49.960 --> 10:52.600
So let's go to another call, and we'll go over here.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.560
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

10:54.560 --> 10:55.560
Hi.

10:55.560 --> 10:57.040
Hi, who's this?

10:57.040 --> 10:59.440
This is Tony from Washington.

10:59.440 --> 11:02.760
Hello, Tony from Washington, what's on your mind?

11:02.760 --> 11:06.960
I wanted to give my opinion of a new DS game.

11:06.960 --> 11:12.780
oh sure sure what's up called trace memory in the US or another code in the

11:12.780 --> 11:19.100
UK it's a great game what do you think what do you think about trace memory it

11:19.100 --> 11:23.820
is interesting what is the what is the point a trace memory because I haven't

11:23.820 --> 11:26.620
really played this game a whole lot so what exactly do you do in trace memory

11:26.620 --> 11:32.540
basically you're this girl who on the day before her 14th birthday finds out

11:32.540 --> 11:37.420
Finds out that her dad is alive.

11:37.420 --> 11:42.340
Finds out that her dad is alive.

11:42.340 --> 11:45.580
My friends you're breaking up here a little bit so it's really hard to understand you

11:45.580 --> 11:49.660
here but I'm going to throw it back to the studio and talk a little bit here about trace

11:49.660 --> 11:53.420
memory and appreciate you bringing it up here.

11:53.420 --> 11:56.700
So what do you guys think about trace memory?

11:56.700 --> 11:58.100
I haven't really played it.

11:58.100 --> 12:00.100
I did a review on that one about three months ago.

12:00.100 --> 12:01.100
Yeah?

12:01.100 --> 12:02.100
I don't remember.

12:02.100 --> 12:06.640
It was the one that had puzzle elements where you walk up through a village, up through

12:06.640 --> 12:09.720
a house and try to put the whole thing together.

12:09.720 --> 12:11.680
And I was really, really interested in it.

12:11.680 --> 12:15.640
I haven't picked it up yet, just my schedule is not allowed for it.

12:15.640 --> 12:18.620
But it was one that I was actually really interested in playing and I've heard nothing

12:18.620 --> 12:19.620
but good about it.

12:19.620 --> 12:22.060
I did play all the way through it.

12:22.060 --> 12:25.480
The only problem with it was that it was really short.

12:25.480 --> 12:31.060
I felt there was really nothing that would bring me back to it once I beat it.

12:31.060 --> 12:35.700
They did have a lot of really cool things with the DS, like opening the DS part way

12:35.700 --> 12:39.460
so you could see the reflection off both screens to solve a puzzle.

12:39.460 --> 12:40.460
That was cool.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.340
But, I don't know, it was a pretty good game.

12:42.340 --> 12:44.940
I wish it was at least four hours longer though.

12:44.940 --> 12:47.420
Alright, let's go ahead and go back to the Skype line.

12:47.420 --> 12:53.020
Again, you can give us a call over the phone as well, 916-226-9067, or you can call us

12:53.020 --> 12:56.000
on username OrangeLaunchRadio on Skype.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Let's go to the phones.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Hello, you're on OrangeLaunchRadio.

12:58.000 --> 13:03.680
radio. Hi Sephiroth1215 here. Hi Sephiroth1215 what's on your mind?

13:03.680 --> 13:09.680
A bunch of things first of all about the new DDR coming out I mean I was really

13:09.680 --> 13:13.920
excited when I first heard it I mean I you know how to make sure like alright

13:13.920 --> 13:19.440
how close are we to April Fools because that's happened before anyway. That was

13:19.440 --> 13:24.880
the resounding reaction of DDR Freak and I'm like come on people they're not that

13:24.880 --> 13:27.680
cruel over there especially about something like this this is something

13:27.680 --> 13:33.320
you don't joke about? Well we are that cruel but we don't joke about that. As we

13:33.320 --> 13:41.000
remember the big everybody is now an admin thing that went on. Otherwise I've

13:41.000 --> 13:46.720
been curious about this I mean I'm sure it's gonna be a big step but um it could

13:46.720 --> 13:53.520
also be bad we never know it could be just another bad mix but I'm kind of

13:53.520 --> 13:59.200
hoping not that anyway but it's it's really hard to judge the game until we

13:59.200 --> 14:03.400
see at least like a screenshot or know something else about it so everything

14:03.400 --> 14:08.520
you hear is all assumptions at this point everything they could change the

14:08.520 --> 14:12.640
foundation of the game for all we know now here's my only concern is remember

14:12.640 --> 14:17.240
the last arcade game to come out and you know this is not one that's really

14:17.240 --> 14:21.520
talked about a lot but dancing stage fusion in the UK another arcade release

14:21.520 --> 14:24.840
that was supposed to be oh it's on brand new hardware it was just a port of the

14:24.840 --> 14:30.600
game to the arcade it was like crap this will not be the case for this game from

14:30.600 --> 14:35.200
what I know which you know I can't say what I do know but it's it you shouldn't

14:35.200 --> 14:39.800
worry that much at this point all right fair enough all right anything else you

14:39.800 --> 14:44.480
want to share with us to broth oh yeah this I mean obviously there's gonna be a

14:44.480 --> 14:51.280
lot of controversy or maybe a little war between the in the group now in DDR

14:51.280 --> 14:55.720
But whatever I don't really care. I mean, I'm still gonna play both of them

14:56.720 --> 14:57.920
but

14:57.920 --> 15:01.580
I've been wondering about the memory card slots or whatever they're gonna do for that

15:02.140 --> 15:09.860
Because I'm thinking like if they use ps2 memory cards and they have to license to use them or to use magic gate

15:10.480 --> 15:12.200
So I'm not sure about that

15:12.200 --> 15:17.940
They could steal the idea from in the groove and use the USB thing because you can put a USB thing in your PlayStation

15:17.940 --> 15:23.820
right yeah this yeah you could maybe I don't know oh no it would work all right

15:23.820 --> 15:26.220
well separate we got to keep it moving here so I'm gonna let you go buddy but

15:26.220 --> 15:29.460
thanks for calling in we appreciate it all right yeah okay have a good one I

15:29.460 --> 15:33.100
would do one more call here on skype line tonight and then we're gonna say

15:33.100 --> 15:37.420
we're done so let's go to one more call let's try one another one over the phone

15:37.420 --> 15:45.060
hi you're on orange launch radio oh my god oh my god oh my god who's this this

15:45.060 --> 15:47.060
This is, uh, Tomo Koon.

15:47.060 --> 15:47.560
Oh, hey!

15:47.560 --> 15:48.560
Hey, it's my family!

15:48.560 --> 15:50.560
What's up, Tomo Koon? What's on your mind?

15:51.560 --> 15:53.560
Wait, I don't believe this idea.

15:54.060 --> 16:00.060
I was actually just going to say something about that Xbox 360 thing and the DirecTV thing.

16:00.560 --> 16:06.060
Yeah, what, you actually messaged me something in the chatroom about the whole DirecTV Xbox 360 thing.

16:06.060 --> 16:07.560
What's going on with this?

16:07.560 --> 16:19.560
I think it's a joke, personally, because this is not just Xbox 360, they're going to make it a Windows Media Extender.

16:19.560 --> 16:34.560
And also, what I don't like is that during this they dropped the TiVo line, so everyone, including me and I have one of these, has to have the R15.

16:34.560 --> 16:43.560
which is also just a piece of crap, which was supposed to promise network connectivity,

16:43.560 --> 16:47.560
but the network connectivity is not only going to work with Windows,

16:47.560 --> 16:49.560
they're not going to bother with their own software,

16:49.560 --> 16:52.560
so me as a Mac user is left out.

16:52.560 --> 16:54.560
Very interesting point, you're right there.

16:54.560 --> 16:58.560
How far is Microsoft going to go to support the whole Mac thing?

16:58.560 --> 17:09.100
but okay interesting well I what yeah and game console it doesn't have to be

17:09.100 --> 17:14.940
your whole media center it really sounds like we're slipping into the realm of

17:14.940 --> 17:22.340
video game corporate politics you know more of another tool to put one under

17:22.340 --> 17:25.900
the other you know that's what it sounds like to me well I and it's interesting

17:25.900 --> 17:30.560
because Tomokun saying you know why not just stick with the games which what you

17:30.560 --> 17:34.560
know and why get into all this other stuff you know with the media center but

17:34.560 --> 17:38.880
I think that's kind of where the next generation of gaming is really going

17:38.880 --> 17:42.440
especially as you know games get more and more realistic and the internet it's

17:42.440 --> 17:46.480
it's becoming you know one one big centerpiece in your living room so to

17:46.480 --> 17:51.600
speak I do have to say that Dan sits for like an hour pulling my mp3s off my

17:51.600 --> 17:57.880
computer through the Xbox just listening to stuff in the living room when I'm in

17:57.880 --> 18:01.200
the other room all I can say is thank goodness for Nintendo keeping us with

18:01.200 --> 18:07.680
just games and not all this extra crap amen so far all right Tomokun oh yeah

18:07.680 --> 18:14.160
what I was gonna say anything else you want to share with us yeah I just was

18:14.160 --> 18:18.320
gonna say I don't think that's gonna be executed well enough because if anyone's

18:18.320 --> 18:27.520
to use one of the new boxes like me it's it's horrible to use it'll probably kill your xbox

18:28.480 --> 18:32.400
well we'll see we'll see all right well thanks so much for calling in tomocoon appreciate it

18:33.440 --> 18:38.480
thanks have a good one it was some of those xboxes you can sneeze on them it'll kill them

18:38.480 --> 18:44.080
yeah it's kind of a bsod all right well thank you guys for calling in we'll open up the

18:44.080 --> 18:46.720
skype line a little later if we have some more time but i don't know because we're kind of

18:46.720 --> 18:50.960
kind of running over tonight, we'll see. For now though, let's talk about Xbox 360.

18:50.960 --> 18:56.440
Loki, one of the surprise hits of Xbox 360 is not something that's on store shelves,

18:56.440 --> 18:57.520
it's Geometry Wars.

18:57.520 --> 19:04.520
Yep, Geometry Wars Retro Evolved has actually been downloaded, at least the trial has been

19:04.560 --> 19:11.560
downloaded over 200,000 times and they've sold 45,000 copies of the game, which is pretty

19:11.560 --> 19:15.700
unheard of for an Xbox Live arcade game.

19:15.700 --> 19:19.440
What's really cool though is this is starting kind of a new trend of games that are being

19:19.440 --> 19:25.840
developed in between $10,000 and $100,000 and are doing really well.

19:25.840 --> 19:32.160
Kind of reiterates the point that it's not just graphics, it is actually gameplay that

19:32.160 --> 19:35.200
makes a good game.

19:35.200 --> 19:38.180
Somebody asked me not that long ago, why is it that you're so desperate to get your hands

19:38.180 --> 19:50.020
on Xbox 360, I'm like Geometry Wars and Smash TV co-op. It's cool! It's really a good thing

19:50.020 --> 19:53.400
that they're doing. A lot more stuff. I know that one of the other titles that they're

19:53.400 --> 19:59.060
talking about coming to Xbox Live's arcade is like Worms, the classic Worms, and they're

19:59.060 --> 20:03.660
going to have Street Fighter 2 of course. So lots of stuff coming to it. Of course that

20:03.660 --> 20:05.620
that means the prices are going to be going up on those,

20:05.620 --> 20:09.020
so I don't like that, but it's still,

20:09.020 --> 20:10.940
it's a really good concept that they have there,

20:10.940 --> 20:12.620
and I think you're gonna see a lot of people

20:12.620 --> 20:13.520
trying to copy it.

20:14.580 --> 20:15.400
All right.

20:16.780 --> 20:18.900
Now, we always invite your feedback,

20:18.900 --> 20:21.740
and so that means we can open up the Skype line sometimes,

20:21.740 --> 20:23.240
or sometimes we're watching our chat room

20:23.240 --> 20:24.560
at orangehonestradio.com.

20:24.560 --> 20:26.100
Sometimes we're reading the mail.

20:26.100 --> 20:27.360
It's a great way for those of you guys

20:27.360 --> 20:29.780
that are listening to our podcast form of the show

20:29.780 --> 20:30.620
to interact with us.

20:30.620 --> 20:32.420
Now, just a footnote, we are gonna be changing

20:32.420 --> 20:36.860
email address this this week even if you're still using to go we'll put a

20:36.860 --> 20:40.500
forwarder in so it still works but since the orange launch radio to go edition

20:40.500 --> 20:45.200
doesn't really exist anymore the new email address will be mailbag at orange

20:45.200 --> 20:48.120
launch radio comm so if you want to send us an email it's mailbag at orange

20:48.120 --> 20:52.380
launch radio comm but it still all works the same dark Sakura gets her hand in

20:52.380 --> 20:57.720
there digs in deep and pulls out the mail so dark Sakura what's in the mail

20:57.720 --> 21:04.720
bag. You make that sound so dirty. Oh my. I have to make sure people are paying attention.

21:04.720 --> 21:09.520
Well, just to go ahead and make a quick disclaimer, by the way, the email that we received has

21:09.520 --> 21:14.880
now tripled in the past two weeks on average. Awesome. So, I apologize if I don't get to

21:14.880 --> 21:21.040
read everybody's email that is sent to me. I do read it, and I try to reply to as many

21:21.040 --> 21:25.120
of them as possible. I try to get in there and read it too, but I honestly don't always.

21:25.120 --> 21:28.440
somebody has something they have to share with me you can find my email

21:28.440 --> 21:32.200
address on the site but you know filter through Jamie because you know she it's

21:32.200 --> 21:37.720
that's her thing well this one comes from Chupa thingy I'm sorry I still love

21:37.720 --> 21:40.520
that is that like those old lollipops Chupa Chupa wait a minute I that's

21:40.520 --> 21:44.880
versus blue that's right I had this exact same conversation thingy all right

21:44.880 --> 21:51.860
what's up Puma um but I got a response response email worries you know

21:51.860 --> 21:56.440
Thanking us for saying that he's absolutely awesome and cool for having my little pony

21:56.440 --> 21:57.440
killer.

21:57.440 --> 22:03.620
Basically, just to give this to one server, firstly let me say that I don't understand

22:03.620 --> 22:06.420
why the IRA cares about transactions and MMOs.

22:06.420 --> 22:09.420
It would be just like taxing play money transactions.

22:09.420 --> 22:12.340
I guess it would be like taxing monopoly money.

22:12.340 --> 22:13.340
I bought Boardwalk.

22:13.340 --> 22:16.480
I better send George 20 bucks.

22:16.480 --> 22:19.080
One pay per dollar.

22:19.080 --> 22:21.500
Sure the play money has market value, but who cares?

22:21.500 --> 22:31.020
Secondly, about the external Xbox 360 HDD DDDD drive, maybe we will be seeing some third-party

22:31.020 --> 22:34.860
peripherals like that so the crappy Microsoft versions would not be able to dominate the

22:34.860 --> 22:35.860
market.

22:35.860 --> 22:38.060
Can you say third-party hard drives?

22:38.060 --> 22:41.660
Also let me say that I am the first person in all the state of Montana to pre-order the

22:41.660 --> 22:42.660
Snoopy game.

22:42.660 --> 22:43.660
You rock!

22:43.660 --> 22:48.060
You are hardcore, my friend.

22:48.060 --> 22:51.340
Sadly I will probably not be the last as well.

22:51.340 --> 22:54.920
With the release of Street Fighter 2 over the Xbox Live Marketplace, do you think this

22:54.920 --> 22:57.020
will be the start of classic Capcom re-releases?

22:57.020 --> 23:02.820
Personally, I would love to play high def versions of 8-bit Mega Man games on my 360.

23:02.820 --> 23:06.460
Lastly, what is the deal with the name of the Bandai Namco merged company?

23:06.460 --> 23:10.920
I would have expected something more along the lines of Bonco or Namdai or some original

23:10.920 --> 23:11.920
name.

23:11.920 --> 23:12.920
I like Bonco.

23:12.920 --> 23:13.920
Bonco.

23:13.920 --> 23:14.920
Bonco!

23:14.920 --> 23:15.920
I kind of like Namdai.

23:15.920 --> 23:18.180
You cannot handle the Bonco!

23:18.180 --> 23:20.380
I kind of like Namdai.

23:20.380 --> 23:26.840
That is a very, though I have to say, Japanese-y thing to do with combination and shortening.

23:26.840 --> 23:29.080
We need to bring back the poll on our website.

23:29.080 --> 23:31.940
What's better, Banco or Namdai?

23:31.940 --> 23:33.200
We'll see, anyway.

23:33.200 --> 23:37.680
We also have one of our, I don't think I've received an email from this person before,

23:37.680 --> 23:42.800
someone named Matthew has asked if we could talk about F.E.A.R. for the PC and are there

23:42.800 --> 23:46.840
any upcoming sequels or is it coming to any console platforms?

23:46.840 --> 23:51.120
I'm gonna be honest with you Matthew, we're human and we work day jobs as well as doing

23:51.120 --> 23:55.120
the show so because of that we don't have time to play every single game that comes

23:55.120 --> 23:58.200
out so unfortunately I've never touched the game F.E.A.R.

23:58.200 --> 24:03.080
I've heard about it, it looks neat, I just can't afford it and amongst all my other gaming

24:03.080 --> 24:04.080
obsessions.

24:04.080 --> 24:06.440
Loki you look like you know something about the show.

24:06.440 --> 24:10.920
I know of F.E.A.R. and I know it's a really kickass first person shooter, having played

24:10.920 --> 24:16.400
it, the only real interaction with F.E.A.R. that I've had is watching Panics from Roosterteeth

24:16.400 --> 24:25.840
which, you know, known for Red vs. Blue, so definitely check that out because that's hilarious.

24:25.840 --> 24:29.480
But yeah, I think it is coming to the 360, probably something that's either going to

24:29.480 --> 24:34.280
be late this year or next year, but it's definitely a game that's going to be ported over at some

24:34.280 --> 24:35.280
point.

24:35.280 --> 24:36.280
Alright.

24:36.280 --> 24:42.880
Macman also points out that Apple says they're working with a new company later to be revealed.

24:42.880 --> 24:46.440
theory is that Apple and Nintendo are working together on the revolution

24:46.440 --> 24:51.920
because they've both released cube-shaped systems I it's a crazy

24:51.920 --> 24:58.040
theory and obviously not the right reason but don't put anything past

24:58.040 --> 25:03.160
those guys if any company is going to be sneaking behind your back it's those two

25:03.160 --> 25:06.600
well there is a mention in here Apple said they're making a move toward the

25:06.600 --> 25:10.600
gaming market and the iMac Mini G6 hooks up to your TV.

25:10.600 --> 25:14.600
Interesting, why do you never know?

25:14.600 --> 25:18.600
Dot dot dot. Alright, anything else in the mailbag?

25:18.600 --> 25:22.600
Actually, one of our listeners, Mike, wants

25:22.600 --> 25:26.600
to know about where we import from.

25:26.600 --> 25:30.600
Well, just a few of my favorites, but more he's asking

25:30.600 --> 25:34.600
are modchips hard to install, more like for GameCube. You don't need to put

25:34.600 --> 25:39.400
a mod chip in your GameCube at all. There's a disc you can get to swap them out.

25:39.400 --> 25:42.920
I actually have a legitimate Japanese PlayStation 2 because I didn't want to risk mod chips

25:42.920 --> 25:47.560
you know back when it was early so I hear they're okay now but I just didn't want to

25:47.560 --> 25:49.920
risk it so I have an authentic Japanese PlayStation 2.

25:49.920 --> 25:53.160
But I actually did email him back some sites and if anyone wants to talk to me in the chat

25:53.160 --> 25:58.480
room I'll mention some just not on the air. No free advertising. No free advertising.

25:58.480 --> 26:03.400
However I'm sure that any number of those sites will ship to Canada. Oh yeah sure business

26:03.400 --> 26:04.400
business.

26:04.400 --> 26:05.400
Oh, yeah.

26:05.400 --> 26:08.400
If you can make the money, they will do so.

26:08.400 --> 26:12.240
I got a few actually about things that we have already or are addressing within the

26:12.240 --> 26:14.720
show.

26:14.720 --> 26:20.380
One last one that I want to approach is from our listener, Jeremy.

26:20.380 --> 26:23.720
I think this is the first time I've gotten an email from him too, so welcome to the Mail

26:23.720 --> 26:24.720
That.

26:24.720 --> 26:25.720
Hooray, new emailers.

26:25.720 --> 26:28.400
He's actually, though, I think on our forums too.

26:28.400 --> 26:29.400
Okay.

26:29.400 --> 26:31.320
But he wants to say how much he enjoys the podcast.

26:31.320 --> 26:32.320
Thank you.

26:32.320 --> 26:37.540
that we do a great show. I'm wondering, since we're changing our format, if the live show

26:37.540 --> 26:38.740
will be able to be...

26:38.740 --> 26:41.940
if you can listen live through the PSP.

26:41.940 --> 26:45.340
I'm not so sure that it's got the... it doesn't have the capability for that.

26:45.340 --> 26:49.240
No, but anything's possible. All it would have to be able to do is

26:49.240 --> 26:51.580
basically essentially how Winamp does it.

26:51.580 --> 26:55.020
Yeah, streaming audio how Winamp does it. Because you can listen...

26:55.020 --> 26:59.740
We use Live 365 to do our live stream and you can load that in Winamp.

26:59.740 --> 27:00.440
So if

27:00.440 --> 27:04.760
When AMP is ported to the PSP, it could happen, but Loki, you're saying no count on it.

27:04.760 --> 27:08.560
Why is that? It's just, they won't do it.

27:08.560 --> 27:12.840
Until, the only way that it would be feasible to do that is when there's a new firmware

27:12.840 --> 27:13.680
that supports

27:13.680 --> 27:17.000
Flash, and then you could do a Flash player for

27:17.000 --> 27:21.720
Live 365, because I know that exists. I've tried to come up with a way to do it, but

27:21.720 --> 27:26.360
no, you're not going to be able to do it with just JavaScript, so unfortunately,

27:26.360 --> 27:29.880
no, the only way you're going to be able to do it is the podcast for now.

27:29.880 --> 27:33.000
Yeah, and the last bit of this email is also the pot

27:33.000 --> 27:37.160
I'm just gonna read it also the podcast week of 1 906 to 1 1506

27:37.160 --> 27:42.220
She said they I forgot who is bringing a Sega Genesis game beggar prince to America

27:42.220 --> 27:47.360
I honestly don't see why they are doing that just seems like a waste of money. Not that many people have their Genesis anymore

27:48.420 --> 27:50.320
I'll give one of our other

27:50.320 --> 27:55.000
Podcast buddies a plug here because he actually has somebody from that team who's putting out that game tonight

27:55.000 --> 28:00.700
I check out Bobby Black Wolf this week, allgames.com slash podcast, because they're actually interviewing

28:00.700 --> 28:06.600
one of the people that is behind that game. So check it out, and I will be, because I'm

28:06.600 --> 28:09.800
curious about that same thing. How are they going to, 42 bucks?

28:09.800 --> 28:14.240
Those of us who have a Nomad will be happy. And if you don't have a Genesis, you know,

28:14.240 --> 28:17.820
if you still have a Dreamcast, there's always Under Defeat, which is another game that was

28:17.820 --> 28:22.760
actually being brought up for the Dreamcast relatively soon.

28:22.760 --> 28:27.740
not give up on those old systems they're still making 2600 games this is true

28:27.740 --> 28:32.540
this is true all right so we're gonna go ahead and close up the old mailbag here

28:32.540 --> 28:35.860
but dark soccer you're not quite finished with us just yet because you

28:35.860 --> 28:39.180
have a story about Dragon Quest and the revolution

28:39.180 --> 28:46.580
woohoo kinda, sorta, maybe. Well, Udi Yuji who was the the project lead in the series

28:46.580 --> 28:53.420
producer for Dragon Quest 8 he was actually at a launch event in Europe for

28:53.420 --> 28:57.320
that actually is in London and said that he was very excited about the

28:57.320 --> 29:04.660
revolutions controller and and touched on more global views for selling Dragon

29:04.660 --> 29:08.700
Quest did you ever play that Dragon Quest game with the actual sword that

29:08.700 --> 29:11.820
you could use this this makes total sense to me because remember that Dragon

29:11.820 --> 29:15.180
Quest game to actually have the sword that you could wave around it's almost

29:15.180 --> 29:19.500
just like this whole revolution concept you know what what this is gonna sound

29:19.500 --> 29:23.020
really awful being the gamer that I am I have never played a single Dragon Quest

29:23.020 --> 29:27.660
game Wow gasps that's really interesting but I mean well we all a minute we

29:27.660 --> 29:32.420
playing guardian legend I didn't see Star Wars toys in college I haven't seen

29:32.420 --> 29:35.660
Star Wars except for one of them see well there you go you want to know what's

29:35.660 --> 29:39.300
that we all have our things where was was my first movie I was one years old

29:39.300 --> 29:45.480
Wow well okay wait back to back to me back to uh back to Dragon Quest okay so

29:45.480 --> 29:49.920
Dark Sakura Miklotov you know a game I'm talking about yes yes yeah look over

29:49.920 --> 29:56.220
here then the game yeah the game where you have the sword it's like you go up

29:56.220 --> 29:59.480
to the TV slash yeah it's really cool looking so this doesn't surprise me at

29:59.480 --> 30:03.000
all but I hope this means we'll you know see you know some Dragon Quest games on

30:03.000 --> 30:06.160
the revolution I'll be kind of cool or Zelda with the sword you just made me

30:06.160 --> 30:11.880
think about something though playing a rod caliber yes you can play soul

30:11.880 --> 30:16.240
caliber with the fishing rod on the dreamcast just thought I'd let you guys

30:16.240 --> 30:21.080
know but there's a just to read one of the quotes from this article says when I

30:21.080 --> 30:25.120
was making manga I met with the technology of computer games he told

30:25.120 --> 30:28.520
journalists I love the fact that it was interactive and that you could do

30:28.520 --> 30:31.720
something and you get feedback I thought it was an interactive story where you

30:31.720 --> 30:34.760
could get feedback and rewards from everything that you do be interesting I

30:34.760 --> 30:39.080
like the idea of interactivity with the hardware so there when you mention the Nintendo controller

30:39.080 --> 30:42.840
it's a new interface and it's exciting to have that kind of reaction.

30:42.840 --> 30:44.680
You do something and it reacts to you.

30:44.680 --> 30:49.240
It's human nature to have something feedback from your actions that's rewarding.

30:49.240 --> 30:53.340
Very interesting so we'll see what they decide to produce on the revolution.

30:53.340 --> 30:56.280
Loki you have some more information on what's going on with the revolution.

30:56.280 --> 30:59.080
Some of it rumors, some of it facts, what's going on?

30:59.080 --> 31:03.240
Some of the stuff, I'm going to consider most of this rumor for now.

31:03.240 --> 31:07.600
Well first off, they had a survey that went out to a couple of gaming sites, one of them

31:07.600 --> 31:12.360
being classicgaming.com I believe, and it was talking about the virtual console that

31:12.360 --> 31:16.520
they were going to be using as kind of like their storefront for all these retro games

31:16.520 --> 31:20.320
that you're going to be able to play and download to your system.

31:20.320 --> 31:24.920
And they're kind of showing some mockups of what the system is going to look like.

31:24.920 --> 31:28.440
They have basically where you can choose the different consoles, kind of very similar to

31:28.440 --> 31:35.520
like a game tap type of thing. Get the rent or buy games. You can do it, you know, buy

31:35.520 --> 31:41.040
each game individually kind of like the Xbox Live Arcade or you can pay a subscription

31:41.040 --> 31:48.040
fee and actually be able to download whatever for that month. So I thought that was pretty

31:48.040 --> 31:56.480
cool and it kind of ties into that. They have a patent that was actually filed for their

31:56.480 --> 32:02.720
virtual console and it kind of covered a few things about how the emulator is going to

32:02.720 --> 32:03.720
work.

32:03.720 --> 32:08.800
Basically, they're saying that the emulator is actually not going to be downloaded to

32:08.800 --> 32:12.660
the system, it's not going to be on the system the entire time that it will actually kind

32:12.660 --> 32:18.300
of download either with the games or will be on some sort of DVD type of thing.

32:18.300 --> 32:22.540
The other thing that it's talked about is you can actually, they will be able to emulate

32:22.540 --> 32:30.060
Possibly the portable game systems, of course like Game Boy and stuff, possibly DS titles.

32:30.060 --> 32:36.740
Also they were saying that the emulation system may be used with other consoles, not necessarily

32:36.740 --> 32:43.340
the Nintendo Revolution, which brings to the point maybe they're going to license this

32:43.340 --> 32:46.940
to other people or something like that, which is quite interesting.

32:46.940 --> 32:53.180
And also I think we mentioned this a while back on some of the mockups for the revolution

32:53.180 --> 32:55.140
where it said choose character.

32:55.140 --> 33:02.060
It covers a patent for replacing characters in legacy games, basically being able to use

33:02.060 --> 33:06.220
your own avatar say in Super Mario Brothers so you'll be able to play it as Link or Samus

33:06.220 --> 33:12.980
or something like that, which is interesting.

33:12.980 --> 33:14.180
There's some rumor mill stuff.

33:14.180 --> 33:17.380
The other thing though that they did mention though was the list of titles that were going

33:17.380 --> 33:22.760
to be kind of the launch titles for this virtual console.

33:22.760 --> 33:29.460
Some notable ones for the NES, everybody's dying to get this, Kid Icarus.

33:29.460 --> 33:33.620
And I was kind of surprised that the Super Nintendo, they actually have some of the Super

33:33.620 --> 33:42.180
Soap 6 games, Battle Clash, the actual Super Soap 6 game, and some other stuff, Super Metroid's

33:42.180 --> 33:43.180
awesome.

33:43.180 --> 33:49.500
Of course, Nintendo 64, you've got to have, you know, um, Pilot Wings, Pokemon Snap, Paper

33:49.500 --> 33:52.260
Mario, and Goldeneye.

33:52.260 --> 33:53.260
Sweet.

33:53.260 --> 33:57.440
Now, um, through the magic of radio, I actually ran out to go pee while you were talking,

33:57.440 --> 33:58.980
so um, did you get-

33:58.980 --> 34:01.020
You're listening to KTMI!

34:01.020 --> 34:02.660
Did you get to the DS redesign one?

34:02.660 --> 34:03.660
Because I'm curious about that, too.

34:03.660 --> 34:04.660
No, not yet.

34:04.660 --> 34:06.540
Alright, well, I want to hear this.

34:06.540 --> 34:07.540
Jumping to conclusions.

34:07.540 --> 34:11.820
Sorry, I just, you know, I'm like, okay, you know, we get it, and Nintendo's going to let

34:11.820 --> 34:16.180
us download old games and we can be all fanboyish about what games, but we still don't know

34:16.180 --> 34:21.460
shit until E3 really, so this is all redundant to me, no offense, I appreciate you bringing

34:21.460 --> 34:22.460
the news.

34:22.460 --> 34:25.980
Okay, now the whole redesign of the DS, nothing official has been announced yet, that's happening

34:25.980 --> 34:30.740
tomorrow or actually on this Monday, the 16th is when it's...

34:30.740 --> 34:32.540
Or maybe yesterday, depending on when you're listening to this.

34:32.540 --> 34:34.540
Yeah, it depends on when you're listening to this.

34:34.540 --> 34:38.660
It'll actually be announced on the 16th, they're supposed to be making an official announcement

34:38.660 --> 34:43.620
about the redesign. Some of the things that they're suspecting are going to be part of

34:43.620 --> 34:49.700
this announcement is pink, all pink. No, that's going to be more of a rounded kind of a cell

34:49.700 --> 34:57.180
phone like design and free voice over IP calls. It's basically going to have that built into

34:57.180 --> 35:03.820
it now. The Nintendo gauge. Seriously. No, but the other thing, there are some mock ups

35:03.820 --> 35:08.620
people have done with interesting ideas for it where they're seeing the console fold down

35:08.620 --> 35:15.020
to almost like a Game Boy SP type of design, kind of like a little small case.

35:15.020 --> 35:19.300
I thought that was a really cool design, of course that was all fan done, but we'll hear

35:19.300 --> 35:24.100
more, we'll probably have more next week about this and when the announcements are going

35:24.100 --> 35:25.100
to be made.

35:25.100 --> 35:29.020
Basically we know that the system is selling like crazy in Japan, they can't keep it on

35:29.020 --> 35:30.020
shelves so.

35:30.020 --> 35:35.100
I thought I read a story this week though that the PSP finally outsold it for a week

35:35.100 --> 35:36.100
somewhere.

35:36.100 --> 35:37.100
I thought I read somewhere.

35:37.100 --> 35:38.100
Only because they didn't have any.

35:38.100 --> 35:40.320
sold out.

35:40.320 --> 35:41.200
Anyways.

35:41.200 --> 35:45.300
Don't try to make that system sound like it's better than the DS. No, I'm just saying,

35:45.300 --> 35:47.880
I'm just reporting it.

35:47.880 --> 35:51.300
Alright, speaking of Nintendo and DS, if you have Animal Crossing DS,

35:51.300 --> 35:54.760
hurry up and take your butt on Wi-Fi because there's actually a little

35:54.760 --> 35:57.400
special present that you can get right now,

35:57.400 --> 36:01.360
and if you go on Wi-Fi, you can just open your gate and close it,

36:01.360 --> 36:05.080
but if you go on Wi-Fi you're going to get a message, a little piece of mail in your box,

36:05.080 --> 36:09.220
from the president of Nintendo and enclosed is a Mario coin

36:09.220 --> 36:13.340
I have a Mario coin. And when you tap the A button next to the Mario coin it goes

36:13.340 --> 36:17.520
wing, wing, just like it did in the old school Mario Brothers and it's so stupid yet so

36:17.520 --> 36:18.080
cute

36:18.080 --> 36:22.820
That's exactly how you can sum up Animal Crossing it's so stupid yet so cute

36:22.820 --> 36:25.080
And it raises your HRA score because it's a rare item

36:25.080 --> 36:29.320
I haven't tried selling it yet though. Good point. Oh, I wonder how much it would sell for. I have a loan just to pay off.

36:29.320 --> 36:32.320
I'll look in my strategy guide. Alright.

36:32.320 --> 36:40.700
Now, as you know, last week on Orange Launch Radio To Go, our podcast, we phased out Dark

36:40.700 --> 36:44.220
Soccer's advice column because you guys are just too smart.

36:44.220 --> 36:45.920
You know everything, or at least you think you do.

36:45.920 --> 36:51.700
I've taught them everything I know from controlling runaway camels to untangling Christmas lights

36:51.700 --> 36:53.940
and climbing out of chimneys.

36:53.940 --> 36:58.060
So to replace it, we're going to be bringing over one of our favorite segments from the

36:58.060 --> 36:59.060
live show.

36:59.060 --> 37:01.580
We're going to be changing it a little bit because we've got to reduce it for time, but

37:01.580 --> 37:06.780
We're going to be bringing over Dark Sakura's F.U. of the Week.

37:06.780 --> 37:09.100
This is the part where we have to get a little bit angsty.

37:09.100 --> 37:12.340
Now, chat room, usually you guys submit your F.U.s.

37:12.340 --> 37:15.620
We're going to get to that during the special live program later on in the night.

37:15.620 --> 37:17.840
This is just for right now.

37:17.840 --> 37:20.620
We're going to do some F.U.s, because damn it, we're angsty.

37:20.620 --> 37:21.620
Right, Dark Sakura?

37:21.620 --> 37:28.620
OH YEAH!

37:32.580 --> 37:34.220
My F you tonight

37:34.220 --> 37:37.860
occurred on the way to the show.

37:37.860 --> 37:41.600
F you to people who think that they can pull out of parking lots in front of the

37:41.600 --> 37:43.620
oncoming traffic.

37:43.620 --> 37:46.700
As in stupid... and also people who decide that they

37:46.700 --> 37:49.860
don't want to be in the lane they're in and so they're halfway in that lane and the other.

37:49.860 --> 37:57.520
I experienced the two together today one stupid person in this old like beat up looking Cadillac

37:57.520 --> 38:02.880
was halfway in the turning lane that I needed to be in and halfway in the going forward

38:02.880 --> 38:06.520
lane and then this car decides he's gonna turn in and completely block for wrestling

38:06.520 --> 38:14.120
I'm like uh-uh I nose my way up in the silver Lancer of love if this if this were burnout

38:14.120 --> 38:16.900
This guy would be dead meat.

38:16.900 --> 38:23.400
I've nosed up, I pointed at the man and said, you back up, and he just gave me this look

38:23.400 --> 38:24.960
of utter surprise and did it.

38:24.960 --> 38:26.960
I was like, that's right, you bow down.

38:26.960 --> 38:32.000
And then, my car being the most nimble and beautiful vehicle in existence managed to

38:32.000 --> 38:34.520
navigate around the evil Cadillac.

38:34.520 --> 38:39.880
I do not know how I did it, because I had almost no clearance, and I am here and I was

38:39.880 --> 38:40.880
here early.

38:40.880 --> 38:41.880
So...

38:41.880 --> 38:43.880
FU to morons on the road.

38:43.880 --> 38:46.880
Alright, Loki, you're FU of the week.

38:46.880 --> 38:56.880
Um, basically, my only FU is gonna be that, you know, I have to wait some time to actually get full auto.

38:56.880 --> 38:58.880
I wanna know.

38:58.880 --> 39:07.880
My FU is to the lack of Xbox 360s. Damn you, Microsoft, for not putting enough out there, and damn you, eBayers, for fucking it all up.

39:07.880 --> 39:08.880
Mikotov, do you have an FU?

39:08.880 --> 39:15.920
Sure if you did not having tomorrow off like everybody else in the world. I work for a bank. So I get it off. All right

39:17.960 --> 39:19.960
All right

39:20.080 --> 39:22.080
Hey, that was PC

39:24.640 --> 39:31.780
All right, so that was our F use of the week I have to do something that I've promised what's that hello to mistress Tia

39:31.780 --> 39:33.780
in the chat room

39:33.780 --> 39:34.780
Thank you.

39:34.780 --> 39:39.380
All right, don't forget, we tape our podcasts live now, everybody, if you're going, like,

39:39.380 --> 39:41.380
what the eff are these people on?

39:41.380 --> 39:45.100
All right, moving on, let's get to our next article tonight.

39:45.100 --> 39:47.620
Loki, what's going on with the game Gun?

39:47.620 --> 39:49.740
When's the sequel coming out?

39:49.740 --> 39:54.380
The sequel's coming out probably either close to never.

39:54.380 --> 40:00.140
Yes, Gun and True Crime, unfortunately, weren't the breakout hits that they had hoped they

40:00.140 --> 40:01.140
would be.

40:01.140 --> 40:07.780
And it's rumored now that they've actually been canceled due to low sales of both games.

40:07.780 --> 40:12.880
And actually I can kind of back this up distribution wise, anybody that's direct with Activision

40:12.880 --> 40:19.480
right now is actually getting a nice price break on the gun and True Crime New York City.

40:19.480 --> 40:22.920
They're selling them for about 10 bucks a pop.

40:22.920 --> 40:26.000
Of course you have to buy like 4,000 units, but not the point.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.800
The point is that the game's not selling what it's supposed to be.

40:29.800 --> 40:33.680
I thought they were really good games, but apparently I was wrong.

40:33.680 --> 40:37.360
All right, now

40:37.360 --> 40:41.720
what's going on with Ragnarok Online? This is a follow-up to something we

40:41.720 --> 40:43.720
talked about last week on the show, right?

40:43.720 --> 40:47.080
Mm-hmm.

40:47.080 --> 40:51.600
You're pounding over there, why? What's up, Logie?

40:51.600 --> 40:55.440
Well, there is a rumor that Ragnarok Online was coming to the DS,

40:55.440 --> 40:58.480
of course it ended up being another funny Photoshop.

40:58.480 --> 41:02.360
So somebody actually photoshopped from Famitsu Magazine some article to make it

41:02.360 --> 41:04.360
look like Ragnarok was actually coming on the DS.

41:04.360 --> 41:07.480
Do you think it was someone that listens to the show that got the idea?

41:07.480 --> 41:11.440
No. Maybe. Maybe. You never know. Doubt it. We do have listeners in Japan.

41:11.440 --> 41:15.000
It's true. It's true. You never know. Alright.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.960
Now I don't know who's got the article on this, but we have some interesting

41:18.960 --> 41:22.920
guitar freaks. Something going on with guitar freaks in the

41:22.920 --> 41:26.400
arcade style controller. Now note, this is not Guitar Hero.

41:26.400 --> 41:31.280
This is Guitar Freaks, the old Konami game that some say may have inspired Guitar Hero,

41:31.280 --> 41:32.280
but that's controversial.

41:32.280 --> 41:33.280
What's up with Guitar Freaks?

41:33.280 --> 41:41.680
Well, according to one of the major importers, there is news that there is a super deluxe

41:41.680 --> 41:48.320
Japanese arcade-style controller for Guitar Freaks coming out.

41:48.320 --> 41:53.680
To go ahead and read this quote, I'm just going to read it from here.

41:53.680 --> 41:57.220
Last night Konami gave the green light for the production of the ASC guitar for use with

41:57.220 --> 42:02.000
Guitar Freaks games, although the final specs of the guitar are not available for perusal

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
yet.

42:03.000 --> 42:06.560
The company's website specifies that it will be modeled closely after the guitar used at

42:06.560 --> 42:09.040
the Coinop GF machines.

42:09.040 --> 42:12.880
Now you can't use a Guitar Freaks controller though on a Guitar Hero game.

42:12.880 --> 42:13.880
That's important to know.

42:13.880 --> 42:14.880
Actually, yes you can.

42:14.880 --> 42:15.880
Can you?

42:15.880 --> 42:16.880
I thought I read an article that said you couldn't.

42:16.880 --> 42:17.880
Yes you can.

42:17.880 --> 42:18.880
How?

42:18.880 --> 42:19.880
You plug it in.

42:19.880 --> 42:20.880
But what about the...

42:20.880 --> 42:21.880
Can you only play the three?

42:21.880 --> 42:23.520
You can only play an easy, but you can use it.

42:23.520 --> 42:28.160
will work. Weird, I thought that you couldn't do it. You just can't wail hard.

42:28.160 --> 42:32.040
Seriously, you can't use your whammy because you don't have one. For those folks that would rather be

42:32.040 --> 42:35.880
playing Guitar Hero, now I was reading on dig.com earlier this week

42:35.880 --> 42:39.520
that there's actually a mod that you can do to your controller to make it wireless.

42:39.520 --> 42:42.500
So you can have a wireless Guitar Hero controller if that, you know, that wire's

42:42.500 --> 42:43.360
getting in the way

42:43.360 --> 42:46.320
and it's getting in the way of you thrashing about your house and, you know,

42:46.320 --> 42:49.900
you know, pretending you're smashing into the guitar and everything.

42:49.900 --> 42:53.240
This is a good way for you to, you know, cut loose.

42:53.240 --> 42:56.360
so to speak. You remind me of one of the more embarrassing

42:56.360 --> 43:00.120
moments in my relationship with my husband. Oh, then you must share. You must share.

43:00.120 --> 43:05.440
I go into the living room one day at one of our older apartments and Dan...

43:05.440 --> 43:09.120
I was playing pada pada and I went off to go to the bathroom or something. I come back in

43:09.120 --> 43:11.360
and Dan's got the guitar freaks controller doing

43:11.360 --> 43:15.320
air guitar freaks to pada pada.

43:15.320 --> 43:18.640
It was frightening. Wow.

43:18.640 --> 43:22.960
Air guitar freaks. So I...

43:22.960 --> 43:26.560
So I'm gonna patent that idea and sell it to Konami

43:28.600 --> 43:30.600
You can try

43:32.680 --> 43:39.960
We'll see what happens all right dark Sakura, what's going on you'd like to help tell our friends over in the UK

43:39.960 --> 43:41.280
What's going on in their neck of the woods?

43:41.280 --> 43:43.360
But sometimes what goes on over there affects what's over here, too

43:43.360 --> 43:46.160
So it's very important to keep tabs on it. So what's going on in the UK?

43:46.160 --> 43:49.700
Well, some of this is a little bit more universal just a couple quickies really

43:49.700 --> 43:58.660
EA is bringing Lord of the Rings Battle for Middle Earth 2 to Xbox 360 in the summertime.

43:58.660 --> 44:02.620
It's a real time strategy game based on the PC version that's due out on March 3rd, that's

44:02.620 --> 44:03.620
in the UK.

44:03.620 --> 44:08.020
And it will be the first Lord of the Rings game to work on Xbox Live.

44:08.020 --> 44:15.900
It's saying it will have a new and intuitive console specific control scheme.

44:15.900 --> 44:19.200
I like the quote in here. It says a promise is a promise EA remember that

44:20.860 --> 44:22.860
So

44:23.180 --> 44:24.560
Yep

44:24.560 --> 44:29.120
Also another one that I am personally very excited about is Sonic riders

44:29.420 --> 44:33.540
Because one of my favorite games of all time is Sonic are that's a great game

44:33.580 --> 44:37.540
That's an amazing game right there, and I actually have Sonic are for the PC

44:37.540 --> 44:40.140
which I still play because I

44:40.660 --> 44:44.940
It's hard to go back and play it on the Saturn because the graphics are just so much better on the PC one

44:44.940 --> 44:47.500
And I do have it on Saturn, as well.

44:47.500 --> 44:52.320
But Sonic Riders just looks like it's, you know, Sonic R done right.

44:52.320 --> 44:53.320
You know what I mean?

44:53.320 --> 44:56.860
Like, anything that was wrong with Sonic R, Sonic Riders is doing better.

44:56.860 --> 45:01.780
They all have these hoverboard things and basically shoot through levels that look like

45:01.780 --> 45:03.420
they're ripped right out of Sonic Adventure.

45:03.420 --> 45:04.420
It's pretty cool.

45:04.420 --> 45:09.100
As long as Super Sonic Racing is in that, that song, I'll be happy.

45:09.100 --> 45:11.740
You know, I have this, Sega loves us.

45:11.740 --> 45:13.180
You know, loves its crowd.

45:13.180 --> 45:15.520
it's crowd really worth the free games then

45:15.520 --> 45:20.620
oh okay why is fantasy star delayed? I know!

45:20.620 --> 45:25.360
I get the free games. shut up

45:25.360 --> 45:27.520
I'm going

45:27.520 --> 45:28.320
there was

45:28.320 --> 45:31.560
there's actually also another thing in here too that I thought was kind of neat

45:31.560 --> 45:35.040
actually makes me think of uh... arctic thunder

45:35.040 --> 45:37.040
is you have a uh...

45:37.040 --> 45:40.000
a trick thing going on in there

45:40.000 --> 45:42.320
where you can basically you know

45:42.320 --> 45:45.500
it's like almost like in the SSX games

45:45.500 --> 45:49.120
you do like a board tricks like a

45:49.120 --> 45:52.500
grinding turbulence you have different stuff going on

45:52.500 --> 45:56.440
you can ride a pipe it's tricky game on it's tricky

45:56.440 --> 45:59.680
bad joke

45:59.680 --> 46:03.880
if you've ever played SSX four of the tracks listed are metal city splash canyon

46:03.880 --> 46:07.680
egg factory and sand ruins where's casino zone because every Sonic games

46:07.680 --> 46:08.560
gotta have a casino zone

46:08.560 --> 46:12.200
well you need casino night okay there's always a casino or pinball zone or something

46:12.200 --> 46:15.920
you know what the music I would love to hear in this? I would love to hear a remix of the

46:15.920 --> 46:17.680
Ice Cap music from Sonic 3

46:17.680 --> 46:21.400
the little disco-y dance-y one. I thought it was pretty cool. It was like

46:21.400 --> 46:24.760
a transcend 16-bit. Also one other game

46:24.760 --> 46:28.280
coming out, Sengoku Basura sequel coming out for PS2

46:28.280 --> 46:34.000
put out by Capcom. And the original development team is

46:34.000 --> 46:39.880
returning for that including Kobayashi Hiroyuki who is behind Resident Evil 4

46:39.880 --> 46:43.600
and Yamamoto Makoto who was piano 3

46:43.600 --> 46:46.440
which that game wasn't all that great but still. Okay I'm going to admit I've never even heard of

46:46.440 --> 46:49.020
Sengoku Basara 1. What are these games?

46:49.020 --> 46:52.220
It's...this one's

46:52.220 --> 46:56.220
actually they...I'm trying...

46:56.220 --> 46:59.500
it's a historical beat-em-up type game. Oh.

46:59.500 --> 47:02.740
Like Dynasty Warriors or something? Yeah, but this one...

47:02.740 --> 47:06.660
and I just know because I know several people who are into the series so I thought I would mention it

47:06.660 --> 47:13.700
But this one, they actually have an art of one of the new characters who is Maeda Keiji,

47:13.700 --> 47:19.820
who is a, they say a historical warrior, actually they have a year on here, 1543-1612, who lived

47:19.820 --> 47:25.040
during the reign of Toyotomi Hideyoshi in the Sengoku period.

47:25.040 --> 47:27.540
So that was pretty cool.

47:27.540 --> 47:28.540
Huh.

47:28.540 --> 47:29.540
Alright.

47:29.540 --> 47:30.540
And then something about a contest?

47:30.540 --> 47:34.460
Yes, a contest for folks in the UK.

47:34.460 --> 47:35.460
Would you like...

47:35.460 --> 47:36.460
Can I enter?

47:36.460 --> 47:39.460
Well, this is a sucky contest. It's not fair.

47:40.460 --> 47:45.460
Would you like to win a DS and Prince of Persia to play on it?

47:46.460 --> 47:48.460
Well, there's a contest, and...

47:49.460 --> 47:55.460
I was going to say something smart-ass, but unfortunately, with Prince of Persia, it's Battles of Prince of Persia, which is a card battle game.

47:55.460 --> 48:03.220
Yeah, but still, basically with this particular contest you can, again, win battles of Prince

48:03.220 --> 48:05.180
of Persia and a DS.

48:05.180 --> 48:11.340
The entry is on Yahoo UK Games, so just give it a clue.

48:11.340 --> 48:18.220
Actually I'll go ahead and, the URL is very long, so just go to Yahoo UK and Ireland Games

48:18.220 --> 48:20.100
and give it a hunt.

48:20.100 --> 48:24.220
Now if you win and you heard about it from us, you're gonna have to cut your DS in half

48:24.220 --> 48:27.360
and send half to us because you know that's our Commission so we get one

48:27.360 --> 48:33.020
screen of your DS if you win sound fair but however however if any of our

48:33.020 --> 48:37.440
listeners do in this contest I would like an email on that one so that we can

48:37.440 --> 48:42.660
publicly congratulate you that's right and and and offer our condolences for

48:42.660 --> 48:46.920
you having to play Prince of Persia speaking of offering our condolences

48:46.920 --> 48:49.900
thank you very much for the UK update by the way speaking of offering our

48:49.900 --> 48:56.140
condolences. Some people actually saw BloodRayne. What happened here?

48:56.140 --> 49:00.340
There's a few people that walked into the wrong theater, you know, that type of thing.

49:00.340 --> 49:09.340
Brokeback Mountain was sold out. Seriously, they really were bored. But apparently, yeah,

49:09.340 --> 49:16.260
it didn't do very well. It made barely a million dollars. Basically, BloodRayne was reportedly

49:16.260 --> 49:23.260
set to open in 1,900 theaters. It ended up showing in less than 1,000 screens and, like

49:23.440 --> 49:28.000
I said, made barely a million dollars. In addition, hundreds of theaters reported receiving

49:28.000 --> 49:33.780
prints of the film that they didn't order. Needless to say, they refused to screen them.

49:33.780 --> 49:38.600
That's a wonderful tactic. Send the prints to the theaters that won't carry it so that

49:38.600 --> 49:45.040
they might accidentally put it on screen. In other news, Ui Bol is a giant douche. Basically,

49:45.040 --> 49:52.440
He hates everything that has to do with Hollywood, calling them as greedy thieves.

49:52.440 --> 49:57.520
Those greedy thieves are paying to finance your movies, ironically enough.

49:57.520 --> 50:03.280
Also during the premier fore-blood reign, actors were brought on stage so evil can make

50:03.280 --> 50:10.200
a little speech, but forced them not to speak because he hates when actors talk.

50:10.200 --> 50:16.720
finally I don't know he's just really in the right business yeah he's just

50:16.720 --> 50:22.920
stupid that's all you need to know and now did you hear the rumor about what

50:22.920 --> 50:27.000
script you e-balls looking at right now not looking at Mel you're so I read that

50:27.000 --> 50:30.840
on the internet so it must be true he may be looking at it but they're not

50:30.840 --> 50:34.920
gonna let him touch it they better not I I have this feeling that Kojima would be

50:34.920 --> 50:41.280
like no miklotov you you work at Konami right is there anything you can do to

50:41.280 --> 50:45.960
make this not happen I would personally like to see it happen why I don't like

50:45.960 --> 50:52.720
Metal Gear I think it would be a great comedy and you know we're getting Silent

50:52.720 --> 50:57.520
Hill and that looks amazing so it's April 21st April 21st which is pyramid

50:57.520 --> 51:01.440
heads gonna be days after my birthday so whoever wants to buy me a ticket to see

51:01.440 --> 51:05.280
it so see we're gonna get a good movie why not get a bad movie in the form of

51:05.280 --> 51:08.640
Metal Gear Solid I think it would be great because it's not you know no no

51:08.640 --> 51:15.120
no no no no no no no no you know we need we need to have snake done by someone

51:15.120 --> 51:19.000
really hot but voiced over by David hater and have David hater write the

51:19.000 --> 51:23.320
script like cuz he did the x-men scripts but he's also solid snakes voice actor I

51:23.320 --> 51:27.560
love this man not as much as my husband but I really think he's cool all right

51:27.560 --> 51:32.620
Well, by the year 2010, there are certain to be lots and lots of video game movies out

51:32.620 --> 51:36.400
there and hopefully one good one by then in 2010.

51:36.400 --> 51:39.480
Some dude has some other predictions for what's going on in 2010.

51:39.480 --> 51:41.880
DarkStalker, you were telling me a little bit about this before the show.

51:41.880 --> 51:43.880
What's going on here?

51:43.880 --> 51:53.520
Well, there's a bit of a speculative article about the game year in review for 2010.

51:53.520 --> 52:02.400
made me in the year 2010 yeah thank you never mind you watch TV so you don't go

52:02.400 --> 52:06.280
to nobody that's gonna I don't watch TV but it's the have a life it's the show

52:06.280 --> 52:10.720
to watch every college kid loves I know I know we're older than college kids no

52:10.720 --> 52:15.480
I'm a college kid at heart work you know what I'm busy doing college playing

52:15.480 --> 52:19.920
Animal Crossing all right anyway dude I'm taking flash animation what you

52:19.920 --> 52:28.180
Well, the speculation is Sony's attempt to hang on to its thin lead in the gaming industry

52:28.180 --> 52:32.960
by only selling the PlayStation 4 to 6 carefully chosen celebrities.

52:32.960 --> 52:38.580
Seems like it might backfire, oooh, children's crayon drawings of the PS4 going for over

52:38.580 --> 52:40.240
$400 on eBay.

52:40.240 --> 52:44.000
Please tell me, for the love of God, Paris Hilton will not still be a celebrity in 2010.

52:44.000 --> 52:47.260
Paris Hilton is reported to have held the new console briefly at arm's length before

52:47.260 --> 52:48.680
throwing it in the closet.

52:48.680 --> 52:52.080
God damn it.

52:52.080 --> 52:53.080
Who made these predictions?

52:53.080 --> 52:54.080
Ms. Cleo?

52:54.080 --> 53:01.480
Nintendo creates the Nintendo apocalypse that will like any type of game controller whatsoever.

53:01.480 --> 53:02.540
How about the Nintendo?

53:02.540 --> 53:03.540
Fuck your shit up.

53:03.540 --> 53:07.720
Instead, you will direct the on-screen action by grabbing a household pet by the front legs

53:07.720 --> 53:11.320
and making it do a little dance.

53:11.320 --> 53:17.880
This is the sighting wheelbarrow controller featuring WarioWare yard work mode.

53:17.880 --> 53:22.860
That'd be great Nintendo faithful pointed out. This is still better than a gamepad for first-person shooters

53:23.560 --> 53:32.160
on the handheld front Sony and Nintendo continue their fight for the minds and backpacks of the nation's gamers by releasing ever larger portable consoles the

53:32.160 --> 53:39.300
Nintendo XL with six screens a folding seat and selection of overpriced candy bars of PlayStation still ostensibly portal

53:39.440 --> 53:45.040
Can help all forms of media including two ton cuneiform tablets. This is absurd

53:45.040 --> 53:50.760
this is where can people read this if they is on wired wired I'll post the

53:50.760 --> 53:53.840
link in the chat room for those of us for those listeners privileged to hang

53:53.840 --> 53:58.120
out there all right uh we're getting towards the end of the show here and

53:58.120 --> 54:03.200
believe it or not but you know what a good way to go out then to talk about

54:03.200 --> 54:10.320
sex let's talk about sex let's talk about sex on the Xbox 360 not literally

54:10.320 --> 54:14.600
sex on your Xbox 360 but Loki you probably could it's big enough on that

54:14.600 --> 54:18.560
power supply you might be able to do something raunchy with that all right kids cover your

54:18.560 --> 54:25.240
ears res controller time Loki let's try to keep it clean Loki what's this with HD porn

54:25.240 --> 54:30.240
coming into 360 this has to be a load of crap right no actually the first movie that they're

54:30.240 --> 54:34.200
bringing over there's a couple companies they're behind it the first one being arrow productions

54:34.200 --> 54:41.680
which is bringing a HD version of deep throat very classic adult film to the Xbox 360 we're

54:41.680 --> 54:46.720
not quite sure how they're going to do this or what format it's going to be in

54:46.720 --> 54:50.240
whether it's I don't know but could be

54:50.240 --> 54:55.200
my guess is probably WMV HD format

54:55.200 --> 54:58.560
so Windows Media anyways

54:58.560 --> 55:01.920
so look forward to that there's actually going to be some more info about it

55:01.920 --> 55:07.160
DeepThroatHD.com is where you want to watch for the news on that

55:07.160 --> 55:10.960
how do we know this isn't a load of crap just because the website's registered

55:10.960 --> 55:15.240
I don't know, I'm taking this with a huge grain of salt here.

55:15.240 --> 55:17.020
How could they possibly...

55:17.020 --> 55:22.200
This is actually from the adult video conference.

55:22.200 --> 55:26.880
Basically they had a DVD version and this HD version playing side by side.

55:26.880 --> 55:30.880
But see, the whole thing that makes me real skeptical about this, and this is what I'm

55:30.880 --> 55:34.200
going into for Next Company.

55:34.200 --> 55:41.640
is actually, let's see here, it's another HD thing that they were showing, but the only

55:41.640 --> 55:47.280
thing was that it was streaming over from Windows Media Center, so that's not exactly

55:47.280 --> 55:48.280
cheating.

55:48.280 --> 55:49.280
That's cheating.

55:49.280 --> 55:52.160
That's not exactly playing on, you know, that's dumb.

55:52.160 --> 55:54.760
That's really dumb.

55:54.760 --> 55:58.760
So I don't know, I'm really skeptical whether it's actually going to be coming out.

55:58.760 --> 56:02.480
I suppose it could do that, but I don't think it's going to happen.

56:02.480 --> 56:03.520
Alright, we'll see.

56:03.520 --> 56:07.140
Now something we know that's going to happen is that there's a conference coming up, Dark

56:07.140 --> 56:08.140
Sakura?

56:08.140 --> 56:09.140
Is there ever?

56:09.140 --> 56:14.540
Well, you know me, I'm such a little horn dog, I had to find out about Sex and Video

56:14.540 --> 56:16.900
Games Conference.

56:16.900 --> 56:23.220
There is a conference going on in San Francisco, June 8-9th at the Nob Hill Masonic Center

56:23.220 --> 56:30.760
that is the Sex and Video Games Conference exploring the business of digital erotic entertainment.

56:30.760 --> 56:35.440
Examples include creating mainstream erotic games, integrating international success to

56:35.440 --> 56:41.440
the U.S. market, emergent sex in video games and video game hardware, creating successful

56:41.440 --> 56:47.480
online erotic games, investing in sexually themed games, alternative distribution methods

56:47.480 --> 56:52.920
for AO games, and MMO-EG panel.

56:52.920 --> 56:55.920
Massively multiplayer online erotic game?

56:55.920 --> 56:57.920
Was that Orgy the game?

56:57.920 --> 57:04.120
orgy for PC dark soccer I think you need to do some field work and attend this

57:04.120 --> 57:06.160
conference and and bring back a full report

57:06.160 --> 57:09.520
do you want to pay for it? no how much is it to go?

57:09.520 --> 57:13.600
do we know? well you can save over 40 percent of the

57:13.600 --> 57:17.320
registry fee

57:17.320 --> 57:21.560
by signing in for it by May 7th 2006

57:21.560 --> 57:25.320
early bird price is $295

57:25.320 --> 57:28.560
through June 6, 3.95 on-site 4.95.

57:28.560 --> 57:31.960
They better have naked chicks there. You know what that would be though?

57:31.960 --> 57:35.200
That would be half the price of my new iMac. So no.

57:35.200 --> 57:39.880
Alright, last thing for the night and then we're gonna call it a show.

57:39.880 --> 57:44.360
This whole sex and video games thing makes me think.

57:44.360 --> 57:49.140
Are video games sexy enough or too sexy? And if you're gonna say

57:49.140 --> 57:50.280
not sexy enough,

57:50.280 --> 57:53.640
what could they do to make games more sexy? Dark Sakura.

57:53.640 --> 57:56.360
See, I think that I'm actually too sexy for the games.

57:56.360 --> 58:00.840
No, no, no, you misinterpreted my question.

58:00.840 --> 58:03.320
I... you know what? You know what?

58:03.320 --> 58:10.640
I'm gonna go back, because the old standby, our motto, applies to this.

58:10.640 --> 58:12.080
Gameplay!

58:12.080 --> 58:16.160
It is the gameplay that makes a game good. It does not have to have

58:16.160 --> 58:21.440
hot, naked people in it, and, you know, pantsless rage, and...

58:21.440 --> 58:26.600
it doesn't need to have all of you know I I I think it's fine to make it

58:26.600 --> 58:29.240
attractive and I think that if the you know

58:29.240 --> 58:35.080
I do have to say that the average gamer they market to is going to be

58:35.080 --> 58:38.960
the 20 to 30 something year old male

58:38.960 --> 58:42.760
who wants to see nothing but boobies you know TNA the whole time

58:42.760 --> 58:46.360
that they can have their thing as

58:46.360 --> 58:49.960
first of all as a just as a gamer not necessarily as

58:49.960 --> 58:53.560
a female gamer I'm interested in how the game plays

58:53.560 --> 58:57.920
if it looks good to go with it fine but I will sit and play Jumping Flash all day

58:57.920 --> 59:00.880
Loki you know

59:00.880 --> 59:04.960
I would say it's a complete waste of next-gen

59:04.960 --> 59:08.080
you know just the whole next gen of gaming

59:08.080 --> 59:13.120
we do not have HD titties in there because god damn it we need HD titties

59:13.120 --> 59:16.520
to be on this next gen console where are my adult only games

59:16.520 --> 59:21.820
If they have a god damn adult only rating system, I want adult games to be on the Xbox

59:21.820 --> 59:23.820
360 and the Playstation 3.

59:23.820 --> 59:27.760
I want my nudity and I want my extreme violence as well.

59:27.760 --> 59:32.480
I want things that will make Jack Thompson go crazy and in fact I want the next Grand

59:32.480 --> 59:38.260
Theft Auto to be so outrageous and bad that it's banned from half the world.

59:38.260 --> 59:39.500
Only I get to play.

59:39.500 --> 59:42.980
That's what I want to see because I think that's what we need and you know what?

59:42.980 --> 59:45.260
I agree with you about the gameplay.

59:45.260 --> 59:48.780
That's where the revolution comes in, and damn it, Nintendo needs to jump on this bandwagon

59:48.780 --> 59:52.640
with, you know, sex games, and I can't wait to see Playboy the Mansion 2.

59:52.640 --> 59:55.140
Is that the revolution, Full Frontal Unity?

59:55.140 --> 59:56.140
Rez 2.

59:56.140 --> 01:00:01.860
All right, comments from our chat room, we have some folks, more naked males, of course,

01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:04.980
you know, the women and gay men, you know, need some cock.

01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:06.980
As far as the asexuals, though?

01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:07.980
What?

01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:08.980
They have Tetris.

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:12.300
Let's see, some

01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:15.780
various comments here from Fireoboma and

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:20.980
GS191, more cowbell. We do need more cowbell!

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:26.340
Alright, on that note, I think it's about time we wrap things up here on

01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:27.880
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:31.460
It was great for a show though, thank you guys for tuning in and listening or

01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:34.740
downloading it. It was a little different, I think some of our folks who listen to

01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:36.300
previous podcasts might be shocked.

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:40.060
but it's 170 that's what what I know it's episode 170 but the first of the

01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:40.540
new

01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:43.820
format so something new we've evolved it's like we change some of the

01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:44.700
ingredients like leaves

01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:47.860
you know are no longer swimming around in the ocean but we spread legs

01:00:47.860 --> 01:00:51.340
so we had some you know technical difficulties there but everything's good

01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:54.020
I'm I'm happy with the show so looking forward to many more

01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:58.220
I in the future so no grand theft DDR

01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:01.000
right evil chat room don't stop paying attention to the chair and they'll go

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:01.300
away

01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:04.980
I alright let's go around and get everybody's final thought miklotov

01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:08.180
I know we didn't talk a whole lot tonight, but thank you for being here and being moral support.

01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:09.180
You're welcome.

01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:12.580
And anything you want for games to be sexier?

01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:17.380
No, because I think that's kind of stupid, except if it's hot guys.

01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:18.580
Alright, other than that it's stupid.

01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:19.380
And what's your final thought?

01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:22.780
Oh, I want to play some more World of Warcraft right now.

01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:24.980
Alright. Loki, your final thought?

01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:28.080
I'm gonna check out DOA 4 this week.

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:32.080
My final thought is I won an Xbox 360!

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:35.660
at the store! Dark Soccer, your final thought?

01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:40.760
Reject false icons. Alright, that's gonna do it. Thanks so much for tuning in and
