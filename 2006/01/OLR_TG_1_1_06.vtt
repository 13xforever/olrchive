we were taping right after our live show of course and we did a little bit of

00:53.740 --> 00:58.260
drinking on tonight's live show so Loki and I are a little tipsy but we're safe

00:58.260 --> 01:01.940

know we're just having fun it's alright makes us makes us a little more chatty

01:06.620 --> 01:12.620
on these slow news weeks exactly I'm not throwing up today so that's great that's

01:12.620 --> 01:15.740
that's a good it didn't we do this before I seem to remember we did a

01:15.740 --> 01:19.860
drunken podcast before yes we've done it before where I haven't thrown up it was

01:19.860 --> 01:23.480
that one time that I kind of miscalculated he was sitting on the

01:23.480 --> 01:27.180
floor over there in that corner Loki since I haven't introduced you but

01:27.180 --> 01:35.100
talking anyway there you go yes here i am um 13 shots down drinking my drink of choice which would

01:35.100 --> 01:42.380
be a screwdriver um i'm gonna try to shy away from that next time just because orange juice is so

01:42.380 --> 01:50.060
acidic it kind of upsets my stomach if i drink too much of it but um still fun and stop rambling we

01:50.060 --> 01:54.140
gotta get to the games sorry that's the alcohol talking that's fine we also have to get to a big

01:54.140 --> 01:57.100
announcement if you're listening to live show this week you already know but

01:57.100 --> 02:00.620
we're gonna get to that announcement right after the top of the show we

02:00.620 --> 02:03.340
always want to let you know how our gaming week was because dammit we're

02:03.340 --> 02:08.220
gamers too. DarkSakura. My gaming week has been filled with lots and lots of

02:08.220 --> 02:12.420
Animal Crossing and a little Popolo Cross whenever I could get the PSP away

02:12.420 --> 02:19.740
from Dan however he has actually gone back and gotten rid of some of our games

02:19.740 --> 02:25.860
like Smackdown vs. Raw and his copy of Animal Crossing so for those who had

02:25.860 --> 02:29.740
Dan on their friends list he may as well take them all because he ain't playing

02:29.740 --> 02:35.580
um but he picked up Dead or Alive 4 and the joystick which I haven't used but

02:35.580 --> 02:39.580
I've heard both ways about I hear it's pretty nice but people have their own

02:39.580 --> 02:46.060
preferences um that game though oh my god it I'm gonna quote something from my

02:46.060 --> 02:48.940
husband's live journal which I think is probably one of the most accurate

02:48.940 --> 02:56.460
descriptions of Dead or Alive 4 and this is the quote here it's dead or alive

02:56.460 --> 03:00.660
again with really good backgrounds bad hair and a hundred percent more hard

03:00.660 --> 03:06.500
yeah what they did they've gotten rid of some of the recovery time in that game

03:06.500 --> 03:10.660
and you have to be freaking fast to do your counters it's so much harder and on

03:10.660 --> 03:16.380
top of that you're the boss is like naked liquid Kasumi and it's like she's

03:16.380 --> 03:24.620
you know scary OMG spoiler so that's all right so it's a fighting game a naked

03:24.620 --> 03:30.140
that's all I need to hear but it's it's just she's ridiculously hard

03:30.140 --> 03:34.020
ridiculous that game is just ridiculously hard but the endings are

03:34.020 --> 03:40.820
freaking hilarious so alright Loki what about your gaming week my gaming week

03:40.820 --> 03:45.540
was also filled a lot of Animal Crossing just I don't know the game is easy to

03:45.540 --> 03:49.700
play for like you know 10 minutes or whatever so I've been actually trying to

03:49.700 --> 03:54.060
pay off my house for whatever reason I'm know I'm gonna get tired of this game

03:54.060 --> 03:58.820
much like I did with Nintendo what I like about this game is I don't have to

03:58.820 --> 04:03.300
play it every day I can skip a day and plus the fiance is playing it as well so

04:03.300 --> 04:08.300
now I've got that going for me too I've other than Animal Crossing though I

04:08.300 --> 04:14.900
actually did buy over the break need for speed most wine I got the plate today

04:14.900 --> 04:34.900
That game is pretty sweet for the 360. I'm very impressed on the graphics for it. The storyline they have going along with it is pretty cool. I definitely like what they've done with it. It's very involved. It's very similar to a Fast and the Furious type of storyline.

04:34.900 --> 04:39.940
you know where your car you know basically gets you lose your car in a

04:39.940 --> 04:45.940
match and you have to kind of bring yourself back from nothing to winning

04:45.940 --> 04:51.380
the top of the blacklist basically becoming the most wanted you know driver

04:51.380 --> 04:56.420
out there and it's very very underground in the way they've done it and I like

04:56.420 --> 05:00.780
the way that they've kind of made every all the the kind of color palette that's

05:00.780 --> 05:06.020
in the game, very washed out. It looks very cool. So, highly recommend the game if you're

05:06.020 --> 05:07.940
looking for a good arcade racing game.

05:07.940 --> 05:12.360
I'm kind of curious, how does it compare to Project Gotham 4? Me being as a person who

05:12.360 --> 05:15.180
looks at these and goes, they're both racing games, because I don't play a lot of racing

05:15.180 --> 05:17.100
games, so I just look at these and go, they're both racing games. How do they compare?

05:17.100 --> 05:23.300
Well, let me put it this way. It's Project Gotham Racing 3, um, that was before, I know,

05:23.300 --> 05:29.220
I know what you meant. So, Project Gotham 3 is very similar to, like, Gran Turismo,

05:29.220 --> 05:33.000
Whereas this game is like a Need for Speed Underground type game.

05:33.000 --> 05:39.780
It's very, you know, the physics aren't exactly accurate to the cars or whatever.

05:39.780 --> 05:43.880
But you also have the fact that there's cops chasing after you as well.

05:43.880 --> 05:44.880
So you've got that in there.

05:44.880 --> 05:45.880
That is awesome.

05:45.880 --> 05:46.880
And it is pretty cool.

05:46.880 --> 05:51.120
And I like also you have the nitrous in there and then they added this thing called Speedbreaker

05:51.120 --> 05:55.640
which kind of goes into bullet time where you can do different maneuvers and whatever

05:55.640 --> 06:01.720
you need to do as well, which is a pretty cool thing to add in there.

06:01.720 --> 06:04.580
Overall though, I've played the game not too long.

06:04.580 --> 06:09.560
I played it for about 30 minutes or so today, and I've gotten through kind of the intro

06:09.560 --> 06:13.080
storyline stuff and I've actually gotten into the game.

06:13.080 --> 06:17.000
It's pretty cool so far, and I like the way that they've done, like they have live actors

06:17.000 --> 06:23.780
in the actual game, but they've kind of blurred them out and kind of, you know, desaturated

06:23.780 --> 06:28.500
the actors so it kind of blends in with the background. It's very stylistic but it's a

06:28.500 --> 06:34.120
cool game. So I played that a lot and of course my standard Grand Theft Auto Liberty City

06:34.120 --> 06:41.120
Stories and playing a lot of Grand Theft Auto multiplayer and of course Call of Duty 2 multiplayer

06:41.120 --> 06:45.700
which I love those games and seriously if you haven't picked up Grand Theft Auto Liberty

06:45.700 --> 06:50.300
City Stories I highly recommend it for the PSP. It is definitely one of the games to

06:50.300 --> 06:57.300
have for the PSP, and if not anything, just to play around with the trainer, which I'll

06:57.300 --> 06:58.300
go into later.

06:58.300 --> 06:59.300
Alright.

06:59.300 --> 07:02.780
My Gaming Week, I've also been playing a little bit of Animal Crossing because I took such

07:02.780 --> 07:05.820
a break from it because I was playing Final Fantasy Advance 4.

07:05.820 --> 07:12.260
I also was playing a crapload of H-E-R-O, an old-school Atari 2600 game that I was playing

07:12.260 --> 07:16.380
on GameTap just because I used to play that game all the friggin' time on the Commodore

07:16.380 --> 07:17.420
64.

07:17.420 --> 07:21.780
And although the Atari 2600 version really sucks in comparison, it's still one of the

07:21.780 --> 07:24.380
better Atari 2600 games and highly underrated.

07:24.380 --> 07:28.680
And the fact that I have the second highest score of all time right now on the leaderboards

07:28.680 --> 07:29.680
over there.

07:29.680 --> 07:30.680
Congratulations.

07:30.680 --> 07:31.680
I'm working on number one.

07:31.680 --> 07:34.700
I think it's just because no one plays it because people don't remember that game.

07:34.700 --> 07:35.860
But I'm working on number one.

07:35.860 --> 07:36.860
I want it.

07:36.860 --> 07:37.860
I want it.

07:37.860 --> 07:38.860
It's within reach.

07:38.860 --> 07:43.220
Well, you know with, what is it, the one gaming site that does the rankings and stuff, you

07:43.220 --> 07:44.220
can actually get...

07:44.220 --> 07:49.460
I can't the escapes you right now I can't remember we that we saw them a

07:49.460 --> 07:51.740
classic gaming expo and everything exactly they're doing actually

07:51.740 --> 07:57.140
certificates now for if you have a high scoring you know in there you can send

07:57.140 --> 07:59.700
to them you know send them some money or whatever and they'll send you a

07:59.700 --> 08:04.420
certificate that says you are the second top player in the world galaxies yeah

08:04.420 --> 08:08.580
twin galaxies came to me finally I think the audience at home was right along

08:08.580 --> 08:10.580
It's between galaxies, you idiot!

08:10.580 --> 08:12.580
It's just the alcohol getting in the way.

08:12.580 --> 08:14.580
Alright, uh,

08:14.580 --> 08:16.580
as far as something new

08:16.580 --> 08:18.580
that I haven't played, hey, shush.

08:18.580 --> 08:20.580
As far as something new that I've been playing,

08:20.580 --> 08:22.580
Loki was kind enough to pick me up a copy

08:22.580 --> 08:24.580
of, I had a gamer Christmas, because Dark

08:24.580 --> 08:26.580
Sakura got me a shirt that I actually happen to be wearing tonight

08:26.580 --> 08:28.580
that said, um, you know

08:28.580 --> 08:30.580
you are a Nintendo geek when, and then

08:30.580 --> 08:32.580
all these lists of, like, Nintendo

08:32.580 --> 08:34.580
things, and I can't read them because

08:34.580 --> 08:36.580
I'd make it upside down. Press up, up, down, down, left, right, left,

08:36.580 --> 08:40.380
ride BA start that's one of my favorites but that only works on konami you spent

08:40.380 --> 08:44.540
your summer vacation in Hyrule yep anyway and actually one of my friends

08:44.540 --> 08:50.380
Animal Crossing has a town named Hyrule but anyway yes when Final Fantasy 3 came

08:50.380 --> 08:55.000
out over here I said that I had the flu and stayed out of school for a week to

08:55.000 --> 08:59.220
play it I like tell you I know this is radio but she did the three with quotes

08:59.220 --> 09:05.100
not really three but three does anyway okay as far as new so dark soccer got

09:05.100 --> 09:10.120
me the shirt, but Loki got me a copy of Mario and Luigi Partners in Time for the DS, so

09:10.120 --> 09:13.220
I finally got a chance to check out this game a little bit.

09:13.220 --> 09:18.000
It's pretty cool, it's very, very similar to the Superstar Saga game, at least from

09:18.000 --> 09:19.800
what I've seen so far.

09:19.800 --> 09:25.480
Doesn't add a whole lot of new DS elements as far as the touchscreen goes, at least yet.

09:25.480 --> 09:28.640
I'm assuming that's probably coming up later on, I probably haven't gotten far enough in

09:28.640 --> 09:31.440
the game yet, I'm still only really scratched the surface.

09:31.440 --> 09:35.600
It seems to right now incorporate more the usage of having four buttons, A, B, X, and

09:35.600 --> 09:40.160
Y on the DS as opposed to just A and B on the old Game Boy Advance, which I think is

09:40.160 --> 09:42.960
kind of interesting.

09:42.960 --> 09:45.400
So you know, there's not a lot I can say about it.

09:45.400 --> 09:52.680
If you enjoyed Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga, it's a real true sequel.

09:52.680 --> 09:58.080
It's very similar, the look is the same, they haven't changed what worked in that game.

09:58.080 --> 10:03.100
I think if you're a fan of Super Mario RPG, these games are for you, really.

10:03.100 --> 10:07.700
Even though it's not the exact same because Square's not doing anything with it, honestly,

10:07.700 --> 10:08.700
they're really good.

10:08.700 --> 10:09.700
Exactly.

10:09.700 --> 10:10.780
This is the next best thing.

10:10.780 --> 10:15.300
All these games like Super Mario, Super Star Saga, and Paper Mario, it all seems to be

10:15.300 --> 10:20.820
like a big cock tease to me for a new Super Mario RPG.

10:20.820 --> 10:21.820
Honestly they need to have-

10:21.820 --> 10:23.060
It practically is Super Mario RPG.

10:23.060 --> 10:30.020
You need to have another Super Mario RPG just to come out, because that game was so solid.

10:30.020 --> 10:35.140
It was a really good game overall, even if Square was in it.

10:35.140 --> 10:39.700
It just was an awesome game, and they never really are going to touch that level of gaming

10:39.700 --> 10:40.880
ever again.

10:40.880 --> 10:44.540
Here's the thing though about Partners in Time, and maybe I just haven't played enough

10:44.540 --> 10:48.380
into it yet, so I reserve the right to change my mind later, but I think these games tend

10:48.380 --> 10:49.860
to get overrated a little bit.

10:49.860 --> 10:57.440
I think they get looked at as revolutionary or something because they're not like your typical RPG because you press buttons along with the

10:57.780 --> 11:02.440
Fighting to make it more interactive. It's not just fight monster go

11:02.440 --> 11:07.440
You know type thing that you actually hit the button at the right time, and I don't know though to me. I

11:08.300 --> 11:10.660
Don't think it it seems to get a little repetitive

11:10.660 --> 11:15.260
It's like I'm all I'm still I'm always hitting the button at the same time always doing the dodging the same attack

11:15.260 --> 11:21.660
So it doesn't strike me as like so freaking revolutionary as I think a lot of people tend to label this game. So I don't

11:22.900 --> 11:29.440
Lavish all this best game of the year praise on it, but I think it's good and I recommend the game but I

11:30.540 --> 11:35.080
Think there's better RPGs. But this is it's just it's hard to say so I don't want to get hate mail

11:35.660 --> 11:36.700
because

11:36.700 --> 11:40.540
Well, not that I'm afraid game. I don't care but it's the type of thing where it's you know, I

11:40.540 --> 11:43.940
I like the game, but I just don't think it's

11:43.940 --> 11:46.860
let me... Outstanding, you know what I mean?

11:46.860 --> 11:50.540
There are some that may stand out Nintendo DS games anyways

11:50.540 --> 11:54.540
I mean, and this is a pretty good... If this was a year ago I'd agree with you but now

11:54.540 --> 11:56.140
come on, we got

11:56.140 --> 12:00.140
Mario Kart, Meteos, and where

12:00.140 --> 12:04.300
where the fuck else would you see something like Trauma Center? Well, let me put it this way, this game is good, it's worth

12:04.300 --> 12:05.360
picking up, I mean

12:05.360 --> 12:09.980
Nintendo DS games aren't that expensive, you can spend the thirty dollars it is

12:09.980 --> 12:14.560
gonna be to pick up this game I mean it's worth it the other game that's

12:14.560 --> 12:18.980
gonna be coming up it's gonna be worth picking up is gonna be actually

12:18.980 --> 12:23.840
electroplankton and that's actually only on the internet you're gonna find that

12:23.840 --> 12:27.440
because they're only selling it online probably because they think it's too

12:27.440 --> 12:32.800
of a collective of a game so that one's actually coming out in about a week or

12:32.800 --> 12:38.160
so from now but there's really not too much coming out that isn't a port of

12:38.160 --> 12:42.840
something or isn't I think like a lot of Nintendo DS games that they put out are

12:42.840 --> 12:46.840
just like kind of enhanced versions of a Game Boy Advance game and they aren't

12:46.840 --> 12:53.400
that really enhanced they're just kind of some really stupid game that's just

12:53.400 --> 12:59.000
using the two screens for whatever reason this game is pretty good though I

12:59.000 --> 13:04.200
mean it's just not a Super Mario RPG unfortunately because the game is

13:04.200 --> 13:07.200
awesome.

13:07.200 --> 13:12.040
Alright, let's get into some news this week and talk about what's going on.

13:12.040 --> 13:15.440
I guess we might as well start it off with a story on the Xbox 360.

13:15.440 --> 13:19.440
Loki, tell us what's going on with the Walmart and the kiosks and all this crazy

13:19.440 --> 13:20.440
360 stuff.

13:20.440 --> 13:25.560
Okay, well Walmart for one, they've actually had a sale that was going on for the first

13:25.560 --> 13:26.560
of the year.

13:26.560 --> 13:30.480
They were doing their New Year's Day sale and each Walmart was supposed to be getting

13:30.480 --> 13:40.520
12 360 systems, the premiums of course, to be selling for their sales.

13:40.520 --> 13:44.200
Actually that was kind of like they were pulling the Best Buy basically to be able to get a

13:44.200 --> 13:50.560
lot of systems out there and I guess a lot of people were able to get them.

13:50.560 --> 13:56.560
Unfortunately 12 per store is still pretty low but hey more systems in the US market

13:56.560 --> 13:57.560
that's always a good sign.

13:57.560 --> 14:02.840
That's less of them on eBay for you nasty people that are making profits on eBay.

14:02.840 --> 14:03.840
Exactly.

14:03.840 --> 14:06.720
Seriously though, the whole eBay thing, and I've noticed this on Craigslist because I've

14:06.720 --> 14:13.760
actually been checking just out of curiosity, it has really significantly cut down.

14:13.760 --> 14:21.360
They've been selling them on Craigslist for almost what retail was for them.

14:21.360 --> 14:25.120
Are we at the point now where we could actually walk into stores and find these yet?

14:25.120 --> 14:26.120
No.

14:26.120 --> 14:29.120
what about this whole thing you know there was a story on dig dot com earlier

14:29.120 --> 14:30.240
this week where it's like

14:30.240 --> 14:34.400
uh... search your local best buys for three sixties and i noticed some were

14:34.400 --> 14:37.600
yeah near it but i don't believe it i didn't i wasn't a waste take gas to go

14:37.600 --> 14:38.000
down there

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
now i do not believe those things are staying there i did i did post that in

14:41.000 --> 14:44.680
my life journal there's a m it's actually some in the area that said they

14:44.680 --> 14:46.200
have them in stock

14:46.200 --> 14:49.640
now personally i don't know if you have to go and ask if they have them because

14:49.640 --> 14:51.400
i did not see them on the show

14:51.400 --> 14:52.600
on the floor

14:52.600 --> 14:58.600
I was looking actually at their games because I had a gift card to Best Buy and I was checking out what they had.

14:58.600 --> 15:04.600
And it looked very picked through. They had a few 2K games and Quake 4 and stuff.

15:04.600 --> 15:09.600
But there was nothing that really, you know, striked me as like, ooh, I gotta have this.

15:09.600 --> 15:12.600
You know, it was very empty.

15:12.600 --> 15:16.600
So, I don't know if they had systems. If they did, they were really hiding them.

15:16.600 --> 15:19.600
They were probably in the back or whatever and you had to ask them,

15:19.600 --> 15:23.000
hey do you have a system you know and they'll give you a you know they'll sell

15:23.000 --> 15:23.880
one to you but

15:23.880 --> 15:26.960
I think you're trying to cut down on some of these internet

15:26.960 --> 15:30.040
you know people selling them on eBay and stuff

15:30.040 --> 15:33.520
I don't know why but it isn't the best

15:33.520 --> 15:37.440
for the gamers. Well I think it makes sense anyway that after Christmas now the demand

15:37.440 --> 15:38.900
for these Xbox 360s on

15:38.900 --> 15:42.360
on eBay and stuff have gone down because now you don't have the

15:42.360 --> 15:45.600
people with money to burn buying them for their screaming kids you know

15:45.600 --> 15:49.000
just like Veruca Salt and their golden ticket you know. Exactly so

15:49.000 --> 15:51.800
So this was kind of a sale thing that they were doing.

15:51.800 --> 15:54.520
They were stockpiling them for the sale.

15:54.520 --> 15:57.760
So I'm assuming probably they're all sold out now.

15:57.760 --> 16:00.240
Now, however, you still want to be checking back

16:00.240 --> 16:04.640
with your game or your not really EV and GameStop

16:04.640 --> 16:06.920
because they're still trying to fill their pre-orders.

16:06.920 --> 16:09.560
But Best Buy, they should be getting some in each week.

16:09.560 --> 16:11.720
Now, they're probably not going to be on the floor.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.180
You're probably going to have to ask

16:13.180 --> 16:15.280
and see if they have them in.

16:15.280 --> 16:24.280
Also I've heard that Sam's Club has a lot of them coming in and Costco, those type of places you want to check and see if they've got them in.

16:24.280 --> 16:29.280
Definitely at this point probably don't pay over retail for them. You can probably find them.

16:29.280 --> 16:35.280
It's just going to be hard right now because they're still trying to get them out in three different markets.

16:35.280 --> 16:41.280
The European, Japanese, and US. And they can only make so many. So it's kind of tough right now.

16:41.280 --> 16:45.040
Well, it's funny you mention Xbox 360 sales in Japan, because I'm actually looking at

16:45.040 --> 16:50.640
an article from Nintendojo, who ran an article on Japan's sales from December 19th to the

16:50.640 --> 16:51.640
25th.

16:51.640 --> 16:54.600
Now, why does Nintendojo running a story on the Xbox?

16:54.600 --> 16:55.600
Well, they're not.

16:55.600 --> 17:00.080
They're actually talking about, hey, the Nintendo DS is the top-selling toy in Japan this week

17:00.080 --> 17:04.240
before Christmas, even though I don't think Christmas is quite the same as it is here.

17:04.240 --> 17:11.740
But nevertheless, the DS sold 597,628 units to be number one for the week.

17:11.740 --> 17:21.380
The PSP, 161,332 units, making it number two, but get this, Xbox 360, the seventh most largest

17:21.380 --> 17:23.460
selling system, is that most large?

17:23.460 --> 17:24.460
Forget it.

17:24.460 --> 17:25.460
5,674.

17:25.460 --> 17:31.460
I would completely understand that, because if you think about it, a lot of the RPGs that

17:31.460 --> 17:35.420
supposed to come out didn't come out. I mean Elder Scrolls for one for the US

17:35.420 --> 17:40.580
didn't come out it's not coming out until I think March now. I mean that's

17:40.580 --> 17:44.740
pretty sad. Granted it is to make the game a lot better because they figured

17:44.740 --> 17:50.220
out how to kind of utilize the the three processors and the kind of work with

17:50.220 --> 17:53.860
their graphics system and stuff to make a better game. So that's kind of cool

17:53.860 --> 17:57.300
that they're working towards you know making a better game but still it would

17:57.300 --> 18:01.240
have been nice to have some better games coming out at launch. Cameo yeah it's a

18:01.240 --> 18:04.520
pretty games kind of an RPG but it's more of a platform game

18:04.520 --> 18:08.480
it's not kinda what you're looking for if you're actually searching for an RPG

18:08.480 --> 18:11.480
when are they getting DOA 4 in Japan because I think this is one to watch

18:11.480 --> 18:16.760
DOA 4 in Japan actually came out about two days before we got it

18:16.760 --> 18:19.680
so they actually had it on December 29th

18:19.680 --> 18:23.000
so it'll be interesting to see if those sales go up

18:23.000 --> 18:26.120
because I know that's a big anticipated title over there

18:26.120 --> 18:29.640
they were still waiting for 99 Nights that was one of the big games that was coming out

18:29.640 --> 18:31.780
Dynasty Warriors type game.

18:31.780 --> 18:35.200
Enchanted Arm was another game that was coming out that was supposed to be pretty big.

18:35.200 --> 18:42.260
They were getting like three or four big large RPGs that were coming out for the 360 in Japan.

18:42.260 --> 18:45.380
Which is sad because I wish we had gotten some of those over here as well.

18:45.380 --> 18:51.060
But anyways, they were supposed to be getting them and they've gotten delayed and pushed

18:51.060 --> 18:52.060
back.

18:52.060 --> 18:57.020
I think it's probably because a lot of these companies out there that haven't had the 360

18:57.020 --> 19:02.680
kits for long enough, and they've realized either A, they've created a game that could

19:02.680 --> 19:10.560
be better, and so they're going back and actually tweaking it to utilize a lot more of the processors

19:10.560 --> 19:16.560
and stuff to be able to make a smoother game, or they've realized that, I don't know, they

19:16.560 --> 19:18.120
can't get it out in time.

19:18.120 --> 19:21.120
So tell us about what's going on with the kiosks now, on a completely different note.

19:21.120 --> 19:23.160
What the hell's going on with the Xbox 360 kiosks?

19:23.160 --> 19:25.400
They got it hacked somehow?

19:25.400 --> 19:31.200
Well, apparently the disks for the kiosks were rushed so badly that they didn't actually

19:31.200 --> 19:33.340
sign them and they weren't encoded.

19:33.340 --> 19:39.300
So you can actually get an image of the kiosk disk and download it on your favorite hacker

19:39.300 --> 19:41.840
or BitTorrent or whatever site.

19:41.840 --> 19:45.000
Not that we endorse that, we're just reporting on what's out there.

19:45.000 --> 19:49.960
But you can download that and actually burn it onto a DVD and run it straight on your

19:49.960 --> 19:51.940
360.

19:51.940 --> 19:57.120
Now that has opened up a lot of things though because first off a few things we've noticed

19:57.120 --> 19:58.320
on the disc.

19:58.320 --> 20:03.600
The Xbox live game they had a demo for Hexic HD.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.260
It's a shockwave file.

20:05.260 --> 20:10.620
It's actually a compact flash type of game that's on there so you can actually run that

20:10.620 --> 20:12.660
internet explorer if you wanted to.

20:12.660 --> 20:15.660
So no wonder these popcap games seem to port over so easy.

20:15.660 --> 20:20.140
Oh yeah exactly because it's just running a shockwave file.

20:20.140 --> 20:25.020
It's really, I don't know, I kind of feel that it's a bit of a rip off if you think

20:25.020 --> 20:26.020
about it.

20:26.020 --> 20:29.620
If you're paying $10 for these games, and they're actually Combat Flash.

20:29.620 --> 20:32.540
But if it's a really good game.

20:32.540 --> 20:33.540
I don't know.

20:33.540 --> 20:38.460
But anyways, this does open up a lot of things because now you can actually develop applications

20:38.460 --> 20:42.520
for it and rename them to these files and run them in there.

20:42.520 --> 20:46.300
So it opens up a huge store for homebrew stuff.

20:46.300 --> 20:47.740
The other thing I was actually looking for.

20:47.740 --> 20:48.740
Oh, I didn't think about that.

20:48.740 --> 20:49.740
That's a great point.

20:49.740 --> 20:53.740
The other thing I was actually looking forward to was the fact that

20:53.740 --> 20:57.620
these demo kiosks, if you've seen them out there, you can actually bring your

20:57.620 --> 21:00.800
Xbox 360 memory unit and download themes.

21:00.800 --> 21:05.660
And these themes actually correspond with the faceplates you can buy for your

21:05.660 --> 21:06.660
360.

21:06.660 --> 21:11.060
The hot rod, flames, wood grain, whatever they have.

21:11.060 --> 21:16.120
Now the thing is, the files in these themes are actually

21:16.120 --> 21:24.080
ping files and you can actually replace them with your own graphics to create custom themes.

21:24.080 --> 21:28.600
Problem is though is we haven't figured out completely 100% on how to define where these

21:28.600 --> 21:33.240
files end or what not and so you can't make your custom themes yet but it's close, they're

21:33.240 --> 21:34.660
going to be coming out with that.

21:34.660 --> 21:36.880
So tell me this real quick and then we'll move on to something else.

21:36.880 --> 21:40.120
Because my mind is still back here on the whole rename the Flash thing.

21:40.120 --> 21:44.180
So possibly if we could get an emulator, and I know they exist already, a NES emulator

21:44.180 --> 21:48.700
in Flash, it could run on this, maybe.

21:48.700 --> 21:54.340
It could actually, and what's happening is they have this file format, it's called XCX,

21:54.340 --> 22:00.940
it's basically a Flash emulator, it's running an older version of Flash, like I think Flash

22:00.940 --> 22:07.660
6.0 or something, and it emulates pretty much everything, so you could in fact create an

22:07.660 --> 22:13.620
emulator for say you know a Nintendo game and rename it and put it on a disk

22:13.620 --> 22:17.300
with just this and this is what's great about this is you can actually create

22:17.300 --> 22:24.220
your own like CD with just these this hexa demo or whatever in it and you can

22:24.220 --> 22:29.500
put your flash stuff on there so you can in effect use this file to create your

22:29.500 --> 22:34.740
own homebrew with using flash programs so you can run flash on the 360.

22:34.740 --> 22:38.100
amazing that all we want to do with these new systems is play the old ones like with

22:38.100 --> 22:41.100
the PSP.

22:41.100 --> 22:44.780
I think the thing that's most interesting about this is that the fact that Microsoft

22:44.780 --> 22:49.980
was touting that their game system was going to be unhackable and yet they make this giant

22:49.980 --> 22:55.620
mistake and release this kiosus that's unsigned and think, oh, it's never going to leak out

22:55.620 --> 22:56.620
into the internet.

22:56.620 --> 23:01.020
Listen, okay, Microsoft, you've got to understand that everything you put out there in the market

23:01.020 --> 23:04.460
is always going to end up on here no matter what you do.

23:04.460 --> 23:11.760
So I think right now it's just kind of a big, you know, haha at them because you've got this

23:11.760 --> 23:17.440
big huge opening, you know, where all this emulation is possible and what they're working

23:17.440 --> 23:22.280
on is actually getting, you know, to run ISO's on it so that you can run the games that they

23:22.280 --> 23:24.520
have ripped off the discs.

23:24.520 --> 23:27.600
Alright, we'll see what happens.

23:27.600 --> 23:32.000
Moving on, speaking of games, we've been talking about a lot of old games, but let's talk about

23:32.000 --> 23:34.640
new games, specifically games that were out this year.

23:34.640 --> 23:39.120
Now last week we talked about a lot of lists going on here from some U.S. gaming sites.

23:39.120 --> 23:40.840
Dark Soccer, what's going on over the U.K.?

23:40.840 --> 23:43.000
We got some U.K. top lists of the year.

23:43.000 --> 23:49.120
I actually, according to Eurogamer, I've got the top five games of 2005, so if you're ready

23:49.120 --> 23:50.120
for the countdown.

23:50.120 --> 23:53.800
All right, let's see how much it differs from the one here.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.960
Number five is God of War.

23:56.960 --> 24:01.520
standard entry, okay. Number four. This is actually one that's been brought to my attention

24:01.520 --> 24:09.040
from one of our other listeners is Darwinia. Oh, interesting. For PC. Okay. It's the game

24:09.040 --> 24:13.600
basically, I love a comment on here, it says Darwinia proves that the little guy can create

24:13.600 --> 24:18.060
something beautiful even if no one is smart enough to actually buy it. Three, Shadow of

24:18.060 --> 24:23.680
the Colossus. Yeah. I don't know, I didn't really buy into the hype on Shadow of the

24:23.680 --> 24:28.440
I thought it was it was it was a pretty game. It was a very boring game

24:28.440 --> 24:34.720
Yeah, I don't know. I didn't I didn't click with me. But anyway, number two Resident Evil 4, of course

24:34.800 --> 24:39.600
Yeah, that just took a lot of the tops. So okay, if that only got number two, then number one is

24:40.280 --> 24:41.480
psychonauts

24:41.480 --> 24:42.920
hmm, I

24:42.920 --> 24:47.280
Have a hard time believing that that's the number one game. It was a pretty average game

24:47.280 --> 24:49.840
Somebody named it the number one game. But of course, I don't know

24:49.840 --> 24:55.840
Especially looking at a lot of the European sites, I see Psychonauts all over the place.

24:55.840 --> 25:01.840
Okay, Psychonauts was a good game, but I think it was maybe a bit underrated, but still average.

25:01.840 --> 25:05.840
It wasn't like, you know, wow, it's completely different.

25:05.840 --> 25:11.840
Because the whole game involved you using psychic powers or whatever to manipulate different things.

25:11.840 --> 25:16.840
It was also done in Advent Rising, which is another game that came out very similar to that.

25:16.840 --> 25:21.760
to that. It's not a very revolutionary game, but a good game overall.

25:21.760 --> 25:27.000
Hmm, alright. I think we might get some letters on that one. Speaking of letters,

25:27.000 --> 25:31.040
you can always email us at togo at orange lounge radio dot com

25:31.040 --> 25:34.760
and Dark Sakura will dig through our mailbag with her

25:34.760 --> 25:39.720
her nails and her claws, no I'm kidding, and she'll dig out the best letters and read them

25:39.720 --> 25:40.880
here on air.

25:40.880 --> 25:44.760
With hot pokers. togo at orange lounge radio dot com is the address to send those

25:44.760 --> 25:45.760
emails to

25:45.760 --> 25:49.880
What are the kids writing in about this week?

25:49.880 --> 25:57.760
Um, actually, uh, Macman has been writing in quite a bit.

25:57.760 --> 26:01.240
Actually I've gotten more from Macman than I have from Rob, I don't think he's written

26:01.240 --> 26:02.240
in at all.

26:02.240 --> 26:03.240
Well maybe he's on vacation for the holidays.

26:03.240 --> 26:04.320
He needs to write!

26:04.320 --> 26:07.480
I keep thinking of Mathman, remember Square One?

26:07.480 --> 26:08.480
Forget it.

26:08.480 --> 26:09.480
Yes.

26:09.480 --> 26:10.480
No.

26:10.480 --> 26:11.480
Nerd plus plus!

26:11.480 --> 26:12.480
Sorry, anyway.

26:12.480 --> 26:18.040
level minus one charisma. Alright, anyway. Plus one INT. Alright, shut up, you better.

26:18.040 --> 26:22.560
I'm just gonna quote, and I actually CC'd you on this email. Hey Loki, of course, whatever

26:22.560 --> 26:27.640
you want to say about Max, go ahead, make my day, of course, you are looking at porn.

26:27.640 --> 26:34.000
One of the few fun things to do on a PC. Zing! Oh snap. Oh darn, like you couldn't do that

26:34.000 --> 26:43.600
on a match. I just don't like Macs because they're cookie cutter PCs as I like to call

26:43.600 --> 26:52.600
them. That's cause you... Nevermind. This debate is so 2005. This is so 2005. Exactly.

26:52.600 --> 26:59.520
Okay. Also, Krispy Kreme, who's one of our newest people on our website. Oh yes, donuts.

26:59.520 --> 27:02.840
cheesecake donuts mmm fattening donut anyway

27:02.840 --> 27:07.680
and said that our mention podcast was so cool that he ran upstairs and told his

27:07.680 --> 27:08.160
parents

27:08.160 --> 27:12.120
I don't know what to think about I'm glad that

27:12.120 --> 27:15.360
parents are involved with what their kids are listening to because

27:15.360 --> 27:18.680
I know this show may not be appropriate for everyone so I just think it's very

27:18.680 --> 27:19.240
cool

27:19.240 --> 27:23.640
and that a he's looking forward to the same game I'm looking forward to

27:23.640 --> 27:27.160
what's that we will oh okay

27:27.160 --> 27:31.640
Oh, I see. You're discussing this, yes. Oh, that game, yes, okay.

27:31.640 --> 27:34.600
Yeah, that special game where you do stuff. Sorry.

27:34.600 --> 27:37.280
We got an... I love this stuff game.

27:37.280 --> 27:38.580
Whatever.

27:38.580 --> 27:42.200
We got an email from Delta One, who's actually a...

27:42.200 --> 27:47.400
I have to say, pretty insightful as far as the... Delta One over to Alpha Four, bruh, bruh, bruh, bruh.

27:47.400 --> 27:52.180
Oh, so we're at the Ferric, though. I couldn't resist.

27:52.180 --> 27:56.120
Suddenly I'm thinking of Star Fox. Star Fox, did I say Star Fox?

27:56.120 --> 28:00.280
You got that from me. Star Fox. The old game Star Fox.

28:00.280 --> 28:04.840
On the way up here, I asked Robin if you wanted anything from Star Fox.

28:04.840 --> 28:08.040
Vodka no J, ladies and gentlemen. Alright, I was thinking Star Fox.

28:08.040 --> 28:13.400
I was thinking Star Fox because I watched some Foamy.

28:13.400 --> 28:18.520
She said Star Fox. Anyway, we're gonna get that explicit tag if you're not careful.

28:18.520 --> 28:23.800
Stop using that f-bomb. Alright. Okay. I said you mentioned briefly in your last podcast that the

28:23.800 --> 28:27.160
The region coding for Japan and the U.S. will be the same with Blu-ray technology.

28:27.160 --> 28:31.160
Do you know if this means imported Japanese games will play on U.S. systems and vice versa,

28:31.160 --> 28:33.120
or does it only apply to movies?

28:33.120 --> 28:34.960
Thanks, and I enjoy the podcast.

28:34.960 --> 28:35.960
Thank you.

28:35.960 --> 28:38.680
Actually, it will mean that both games will play on the same systems.

28:38.680 --> 28:44.120
Unfortunately, they probably won't put English language in there, so you're kind of screwed

28:44.120 --> 28:46.080
in that sense, but yeah, you will be able to.

28:46.080 --> 28:49.840
Couldn't, well, but couldn't they do, because we don't really know what PS3 is all about

28:49.840 --> 28:50.840
yet.

28:50.840 --> 28:55.760
we see some type of Sony-enabled protection?

28:55.760 --> 28:57.200
Or do you think they really care at this point?

28:57.200 --> 29:00.520
I mean, I never understood why they were so protective

29:00.520 --> 29:02.840
over Japanese games should not play in the U.S.,

29:02.840 --> 29:05.240
you know, because it's like, a game sold is a game sold.

29:05.240 --> 29:06.920
Well, I think what they're doing is they're kinda

29:06.920 --> 29:10.400
going along with the same type of format

29:10.400 --> 29:12.760
as they're doing with the PSP, whereas the PSP,

29:12.760 --> 29:14.600
you can pretty much import Japanese stuff

29:14.600 --> 29:17.000
and play it without any protection whatsoever.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.200
I'm not sure about the Europe area.

29:20.200 --> 29:30.200
Actually, Europe and Africa are sharing a region code, so they will not be able to play any of the American or Japanese games.

29:30.200 --> 29:32.200
But that makes sense, because they're TVs, right?

29:32.200 --> 29:33.200
Exactly, they're PAL.

29:33.200 --> 29:34.200
I'm starting to think, though...

29:34.200 --> 29:36.200
But it doesn't matter if you have an HDTV.

29:36.200 --> 29:37.200
Yeah, exactly.

29:37.200 --> 29:39.200
Or a computer monitor.

29:39.200 --> 29:42.200
Not everybody's going to be on HDTV for five years, at least.

29:42.200 --> 29:49.200
Pretty soon, though, I'm thinking that by this next generation of gaming, we are going to start getting into one unified format for the entire world,

29:49.200 --> 29:53.380
world which would be nice because then we'd be able to get the games released at the same

29:53.380 --> 29:57.860
time instead of waiting, I don't know, six months to release Katamari Damacy, you know,

29:57.860 --> 29:59.880
We Love Katamari or whatever.

29:59.880 --> 30:04.780
Yeah, I think it's going to be until we get to like Playstation 4 and that whole gen of

30:04.780 --> 30:09.220
games and whatever else decides to come out around then, until we start seeing the more

30:09.220 --> 30:13.240
like mandatory HD and all that stuff that you guys are talking about, but that's years

30:13.240 --> 30:14.240
and years away.

30:14.240 --> 30:17.800
Assuming there's not another video game crash as some people are predicting.

30:17.800 --> 30:21.360
they're talking about boom in the market so yeah apparently the arcade market's

30:21.360 --> 30:25.400
picked up a bit yeah I don't really I just remember some of the things I've

30:25.400 --> 30:29.560
been hearing you know Sega's getting back into into some of that too

30:29.560 --> 30:34.160
god bless Sega for showing some love to the arcade okay you know what we need is

30:34.160 --> 30:38.920
planet Harrier on something at home thank you I freaking love planet Harrier

30:38.920 --> 30:43.740
any other letters for us this week well I had actually basically replied the

30:43.740 --> 30:46.640
same and got a pretty excited response from that.

30:46.640 --> 30:47.640
Right on.

30:47.640 --> 30:53.260
Also, we have an email from one of our long-term fans, Asian buddy Paul.

30:53.260 --> 30:55.260
Yes sir, how's he doing?

30:55.260 --> 30:59.580
Just to quote this letter, Happy New Year Sky Dark Sakura and Loki.

30:59.580 --> 31:03.320
Just wanted to wish you guys another great year of awesome podcasts and memorable live

31:03.320 --> 31:04.320
shows.

31:04.320 --> 31:07.660
I have good feelings about 2006 for gaming and everything in general.

31:07.660 --> 31:10.540
Oh my gosh, the announcement!

31:10.540 --> 31:21.500
I think this is a quote on here for a PS3 Revolution Year of the Dog, talks are lucky.

31:21.500 --> 31:24.700
I thought that was pretty nice.

31:24.700 --> 31:28.700
It's funny that Paul brought up the podcast in 2006 thing.

31:28.700 --> 31:32.660
Just real quickly want to say there's going to be some big changes coming to the Orange

31:32.660 --> 31:37.520
Launch Radio podcast starting Sunday, January 15th.

31:37.520 --> 31:42.180
that week we will actually be podcasting two shows a week for you guys. We're

31:42.180 --> 31:45.880
gonna be doing two shows a week on the podcast. Both shows will actually be

31:45.880 --> 31:52.020
taped live Sunday nights on our station. We're kind of fusing the two shows we

31:52.020 --> 31:55.780
have together right now. We're gonna fuse those shows together so that you the

31:55.780 --> 31:59.960
listener can actually participate more in our show by calling in, being in our

31:59.960 --> 32:03.500
chat room. It's gonna be awesome. We're gonna have a whole new level of listener

32:03.500 --> 32:07.000
interactivity that's going to go into our podcast.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.340
So you're going to hear a lot of those changes

32:08.340 --> 32:10.700
starting on the 15th, so it's going to be a good time.

32:10.700 --> 32:11.820
So stay tuned for that.

32:11.820 --> 32:13.940
More information available on orangehonseradio.com.

32:13.940 --> 32:17.540
We also did get another email from MacMan

32:17.540 --> 32:19.740
about having trouble using our site

32:19.740 --> 32:21.740
to get into the IRC chat room.

32:21.740 --> 32:22.700
Uh-oh.

32:22.700 --> 32:25.060
Which, you know, is part of, you know,

32:25.060 --> 32:26.500
it goes hand-in-hand with what you're saying

32:26.500 --> 32:29.620
about us having that interactive level with our listeners.

32:29.620 --> 32:32.020
So I'm thinking maybe we should look into

32:32.020 --> 32:35.660
having some sort of Mac-related link off of our website.

32:35.660 --> 32:38.080
Well, hypothetically, I think there's a link on there

32:38.080 --> 32:40.460
that should work with any IRC client,

32:40.460 --> 32:43.380
but here's the quick story, I wanna keep it quick.

32:43.380 --> 32:46.100
Any IRC client, you don't necessarily have to,

32:46.100 --> 32:48.140
he's probably having problems with the Java chat room,

32:48.140 --> 32:50.200
but if you have any IRC,

32:50.200 --> 32:52.260
if you have any, well, I know Java would work on any system,

32:52.260 --> 32:56.340
but okay, well, with any IRC client, hypothetically,

32:56.340 --> 32:59.100
you should be able to connect to any other side IRC

32:59.100 --> 33:02.940
is the network, other side IRC, and our chat room is

33:02.940 --> 33:03.940
pound orange lounge.

33:03.940 --> 33:06.420
But I warn you guys, outside of our live shows,

33:06.420 --> 33:08.460
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday nights,

33:08.460 --> 33:10.500
it's not too active.

33:10.500 --> 33:11.700
It's kind of on the dead side.

33:11.700 --> 33:13.740
But once in a while, we do have our regulars

33:13.740 --> 33:17.300
who keep an eye on things and who are policing things

33:17.300 --> 33:19.220
that'll talk to you if they're there.

33:19.220 --> 33:22.340
It is more active, though, in our forums.

33:22.340 --> 33:22.980
That's true.

33:22.980 --> 33:23.860
The forums are on our radio.

33:23.860 --> 33:25.940
Also, if you sort of want to get an idea of what things are

33:25.940 --> 33:28.300
like in our chat room, if you go onto our forums

33:28.300 --> 33:33.240
and look at the quote thread under a random chatter, get an idea.

33:33.240 --> 33:34.240
Such randomness.

33:34.240 --> 33:35.240
Oh yes.

33:35.240 --> 33:37.240
Alright, anything else in our mailbox?

33:37.240 --> 33:38.240
Nope.

33:38.240 --> 33:39.240
Then we need to get some more emails.

33:39.240 --> 33:43.440
togoatorangelandtrader.com is the place to send them.

33:43.440 --> 33:46.680
Write them on a lovely stationery so that, you know, we have something pretty to look

33:46.680 --> 33:47.680
at.

33:47.680 --> 33:48.680
Alright.

33:48.680 --> 33:53.840
Anyway, let's go on over to Loki, who has yet another Xbox story, but this is an update

33:53.840 --> 33:56.120
to something we talked about last week with the diamond cards.

33:56.120 --> 34:02.560
Yes, the whole thing with diamond cards. I'm not sure if it's just an oversight on the whole site whether they I

34:03.120 --> 34:07.160
don't know forgot something but apparently if you actually

34:07.880 --> 34:09.880
try to put in a

34:10.400 --> 34:13.840
Gamer tag that's already been used like for example

34:14.160 --> 34:18.120
You'll get a message that says if you believe someone else has registered with your gamertag

34:18.120 --> 34:21.260
Please send an email to support at xboxdiamond.com

34:21.840 --> 34:23.960
The only problem is that it's actually

34:23.960 --> 34:28.960
It's actually xboxdiamondcard.com not xboxdiamond.

34:28.960 --> 34:32.960
Xbox Diamond is owned by another cyber squatter.

34:32.960 --> 34:33.960
Uh oh.

34:33.960 --> 34:38.960
So if you send an email there, you're going to be sending all your personal information to God knows who.

34:38.960 --> 34:39.960
Yikes.

34:39.960 --> 34:41.960
So you got to watch out for that kind of stuff.

34:41.960 --> 34:46.960
Apparently the domain has been changing hands on eBay.

34:46.960 --> 34:50.960
You know, because I guess they figured out the Diamond Card thing was going to be coming out.

34:50.960 --> 34:57.260
out I don't know it's just basically watch where you're sending your stuff to

34:57.260 --> 35:02.000
definitely check the URLs if it's not something that you know is part of the

35:02.000 --> 35:08.120
site I probably don't send an email to it all right more news going on of one

35:08.120 --> 35:11.440
one other quick Xbox 360 related story I guess it's a little bit redundant because

35:11.440 --> 35:13.920
we talked about this game a lot but I just want to confirm for you guys dead

35:13.920 --> 35:17.880
or alive 4 did come out December 29th is when it shipped hitting the streets

35:17.880 --> 35:18.880
December 30th.

35:18.880 --> 35:20.160
Loki, what the hell happened?

35:20.160 --> 35:22.000
Why didn't it come out January 2nd?

35:22.000 --> 35:23.120
How did they make it out early?

35:23.120 --> 35:29.280
Well, the whole thing was is actually they, I guess they pushed ahead their shipment.

35:29.280 --> 35:34.360
They kind of were overestimating when they were going to have the game out and they were

35:34.360 --> 35:38.560
able to finish it before that and so they were releasing before that.

35:38.560 --> 35:42.520
They're basically, all they were doing is really tweaking online stuff and once that

35:42.520 --> 35:47.280
was all done, they pressed it and it went gold and got it out a couple days beforehand.

35:47.280 --> 35:52.000
I mean, they only really did get it out one day before because, you know, if they had

35:52.000 --> 35:58.560
deleted one day it would have come out on the second, you know, holidays.

35:58.560 --> 36:00.280
It's good for everybody else.

36:00.280 --> 36:03.960
Good luck finding it though because it is one of the most anticipated games, you know,

36:03.960 --> 36:05.600
for the 360.

36:05.600 --> 36:06.600
It's really good.

36:06.600 --> 36:11.560
I mean, one of the only fighting games out there for the 360, so good luck.

36:11.560 --> 36:16.780
Speaking of most anticipated games, we were talking last week about our favorite games

36:16.780 --> 36:21.000
of 2005 and now this week I'd like to ask you guys what is your most

36:21.000 --> 36:25.020
anticipated game of 2006? What game are you looking forward to

36:25.020 --> 36:28.580
and why? Loki, start us off.

36:28.580 --> 36:35.420
There is so much good stuff. You gotta pick one. Personally my favorite so far

36:35.420 --> 36:38.580
and this is going to be the first one that's going to be coming out is Full Auto.

36:38.580 --> 36:42.060
That is my game that's going to be the one that replaces

36:42.060 --> 36:47.600
you know, burnout revenge for the ultimate in racing and combat type games.

36:47.600 --> 36:52.220
What I'm hoping that they do is actually really see Twisted Metal

36:52.220 --> 36:55.260
4 or 5 or whatever for the

36:55.260 --> 36:59.180
PS3 because this is probably going to be the next game that's going to top that.

36:59.180 --> 37:04.380
I would say my most anticipated game would probably be Final Fantasy 12

37:04.380 --> 37:08.140
assuming we're actually going to get it this year, which I think we will. I think we

37:08.140 --> 37:08.940
will late in the year.

37:08.940 --> 37:12.300
I'm just the demo is so sweet and it's it's I'm sorry

37:12.300 --> 37:18.300
It's a Final Fantasy fanboy and me deal with it Dark Sakura your most anticipated game of 2006 Kingdom Hearts 2. Oh

37:19.260 --> 37:20.780
Of course

37:20.780 --> 37:24.900
It's it's so tough because this is a really good gaming year honestly

37:25.500 --> 37:32.620
It's all about the Steamboat Willie level and Tron light cycles. Hello. What do you think about what you've seen of the Japanese version?

37:32.620 --> 37:35.140
We see more and more of it hitting the internet. I've seen quite a bit

37:35.140 --> 37:45.820
there's a I still wouldn't want Aerith to die again but having a having a the

37:45.820 --> 37:50.040
more more cloud is always nice and he's actually it's actually I don't know if

37:50.040 --> 37:58.120
you noticed his outfit mm-hmm it's actually I've met children cloud oh very

37:58.120 --> 38:03.680
cool see this is why I want a new Super Mario RPG because they've done it so

38:03.680 --> 38:11.120
well with Disney and Square, why the hell can't they do it with Square and Nintendo?

38:11.120 --> 38:15.040
They've done it so well, they've really refined the whole RPG thing.

38:15.040 --> 38:19.840
It's P. Diddy said it best, it's all about the Benjamins.

38:19.840 --> 38:24.040
I'd pay for that game that we made, seriously.

38:24.040 --> 38:27.720
Another hypothetical question, here we go, because this was a story I found on one of

38:27.720 --> 38:31.820
those portal sites, I want to say it was Dig or something, but this comes from Retro Gaming

38:31.820 --> 38:37.040
with Racket Boy, it's the list of ten games that actually need a sequel. I want to see

38:37.040 --> 38:42.780
if you guys think there's anything missing from this list. Knights and Dreams, they say,

38:42.780 --> 38:48.660
needs a sequel. Definitely. Beyond Good and Evil. I'm not sure about that game. Guardian

38:48.660 --> 38:54.340
Hero, it was kind of under the radar, it came out in 2004. It's, oh well, forget it. You

38:54.340 --> 38:58.840
said Guardian Heroes, so I'm all about that. Now Guardian Heroes on the Saturn. Guardian

38:58.840 --> 39:03.600
Heroes is freaking sexy and I have that game actually actually you know what

39:03.600 --> 39:09.240
what if I am correct I think it already did get a sequel in Japan some of these

39:09.240 --> 39:14.360
technically had sequels like another one on this list here is Chrono Trigger yeah

39:14.360 --> 39:18.960
they say that this the sequel wasn't really the game you know what I mean it

39:18.960 --> 39:24.440
was I know but across was a true sequel they this for the purpose of this

39:24.440 --> 39:27.440
article they're calling it a spin-off I know but I know it's it's a gray area

39:27.440 --> 39:34.240
It's a great area. Anyway, um, let's see. So Kid Icarus. That's a popular choice. Definitely. Absolutely. That's a no-brainer

39:35.880 --> 39:37.880
Comics zone

39:38.760 --> 39:44.640
No, no, that's that's that mandatory WTF pic Skies of Arcadia

39:45.920 --> 39:47.920
Maybe sonic CD

39:48.480 --> 39:52.320
No, yes. Oh my god. I agree with the Japanese music

39:52.320 --> 39:55.440
Grim Fandango which is another one of those

39:55.440 --> 39:59.120
I never really played it but here's one I agree with this

39:59.120 --> 40:02.280
American McGee's Alice. Remember that?

40:02.280 --> 40:07.680
Tomb Raider on crack. Now listen now American McGee is doing Bad Day L.A.

40:07.680 --> 40:10.760
and that game is fucking sexy. Alright

40:10.760 --> 40:14.840
what's not on this list that should be? Dark Sakura.

40:14.840 --> 40:18.240
You know what I'm gonna say. I know you're gonna take mine but that's alright we both have the same

40:18.240 --> 40:20.000
one here so Dark Sakura and I share

40:20.000 --> 40:25.680
a guardian legend guardian legend best 8-bit game that actually I got ignored

40:25.680 --> 40:26.480
in something else

40:26.480 --> 40:30.080
what we need more games in the fantasy zone series okay

40:30.080 --> 40:34.120
there you go yes I'll do it well there was fancies on me well anyway I have

40:34.120 --> 40:38.040
every version a fantasy season wasn't released from how about a new Alex Kidd

40:38.040 --> 40:42.800
but I don't know Alex Kidd shinobi world was sorta the top for me

40:42.800 --> 40:46.920
anyway low-key what do you think I've only got two all right says I'm by our

40:46.920 --> 40:48.000
commando for one

40:48.000 --> 40:51.720
Oh, good choice. Because that's really awesome and I would like to see another game in the

40:51.720 --> 40:53.220
Mega Man Legends series

40:53.220 --> 40:56.400
because I really like those games and I think they're pretty solid

40:56.400 --> 41:01.320
RPGs for the Mega Man series. Good choices all around, good stuff.

41:01.320 --> 41:04.960
If only somebody was actually listening to us this would be a great

41:04.960 --> 41:06.280
gaming game. Yeah, too bad

41:06.280 --> 41:10.440
no one important. That's right. Something important that you

41:10.440 --> 41:11.800
should listen to every week

41:11.800 --> 41:15.560
because it betters your life is Dark Sakura's advice column.

41:15.560 --> 41:23.200
so Dark Sakura she is here every week to tell you guys a little piece of advice

41:23.200 --> 41:28.160
because you know if we just sat around and played video games all day long we

41:28.160 --> 41:33.320
would have no time to come up with new lists exactly all right here is Dark

41:33.320 --> 41:39.360
Sakura with her advice column and Dark Sakura what are you gonna tell all the

41:39.360 --> 41:43.680
kids out there on Orange Lawns Radio Land about this week um today's piece

41:43.680 --> 41:48.780
of advice is something very important in the post-holiday time. How to untangle Christmas

41:48.780 --> 41:55.780
tree lights. Number 1. Unplug all connected strands. Unplug all strands so your tangle

41:55.960 --> 42:00.520
is one containing several knotted sections, not one long knotted strand. The shorter the

42:00.520 --> 42:07.520
strands the less complex the knots. 2. Find a free end. 3. Loosen all the knots. When

42:07.520 --> 42:11.400
the knots. When the knots are all loose, create a hole through the

42:11.400 --> 42:16.000
tangle where free ends lose the mass. Four, roll or wind the free end through

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
each knot in the tangle. Treat the strands gently to avoid breaking the

42:19.000 --> 42:24.400
bolts. Five, untie each successive knot. Keep the free end rolled to make it

42:24.400 --> 42:28.620
easier to work with and reduce the amount of cord to pull through. Six, keep

42:28.620 --> 42:32.540
the free end under control. Never pull on the free end. Pulling will tighten the

42:32.540 --> 42:36.600
tangle. The knot free section should continue to get longer. Seven, repeat as

42:36.600 --> 42:44.800
necessary but my final piece of advice use candles what other than you celebrate

42:44.800 --> 42:48.720
Hanukkah I don't know but no my final piece of advice is just don't let him

42:48.720 --> 42:56.560
get tangled in the first place it's not that hard stop being lazy that's my

42:56.560 --> 43:01.840
foul piece of advice stop being lazy rumors abound that the new world of

43:01.840 --> 43:06.160
Warcraft race has been revealed by the February issue of computer gaming

43:06.160 --> 43:10.680
saying that the new race will be the, and forgive me if I pronounce this wrong,

43:10.680 --> 43:16.880
Draeneye, D-R-A-E-N-E-I, I've been three weeks without World of Warcraft and I've

43:16.880 --> 43:20.080
been drinking tonight, so forgive me, Draeneye, or something like that, Draeneye?

43:20.080 --> 43:24.760
I don't think that's exactly how it's pronounced, but anyways, I don't get it.

43:24.760 --> 43:29.120
I get you, okay, it's basically this. You guys, you've seen, I'm sure you've seen this on

43:29.120 --> 43:32.160
most of the gaming websites out there anyway, we're just kind of beating a

43:32.160 --> 43:37.900
dead horse here but what do we think? Is this actually legit or what? Well first off let

43:37.900 --> 43:44.300
me add that computer gaming magazine has come out and said that this source is not official

43:44.300 --> 43:51.620
but it is basically a highly rumored source that this is what the next alliance race is

43:51.620 --> 43:57.700
going to be. Also I'd like to add my coworker who is a huge World of Warcraft fan who says

43:57.700 --> 44:03.140
that a lot of the storylines point that this is going to be the next likely race that's

44:03.140 --> 44:07.900
going to be for the Alliance, just because they're trying to balance the Alliance and

44:07.900 --> 44:08.900
Horde races.

44:08.900 --> 44:10.940
Yeah, the Alliance needs some ugly people, essentially.

44:10.940 --> 44:11.940
Exactly, exactly.

44:11.940 --> 44:13.580
I haven't seen these characters, they're pretty ugly.

44:13.580 --> 44:15.060
DarkSakura, any thoughts on that?

44:15.060 --> 44:18.960
I haven't played any World of Warcraft in months, and I still need to renew my account.

44:18.960 --> 44:21.860
I wish the Pandaren rumors were more true.

44:21.860 --> 44:27.300
Unfortunately, the Chinese are a bitter race.

44:27.300 --> 44:30.880
I'm just gonna wait and see. I'm gonna be renewing my World of Warcraft since I can

44:30.880 --> 44:34.520
actually play for a couple weeks before school starts, so who knows.

44:34.520 --> 44:39.960
Alright, moving on. We're gonna do another story here, and DarkSakura

44:39.960 --> 44:44.160
is going to tell us about European release dates. What's coming up in the UK?

44:44.160 --> 44:46.120
Hey, guess what? We have some!

44:46.120 --> 44:48.660
A few of them, and they're all the same game.

44:48.660 --> 44:49.540
Not really.

44:49.540 --> 44:52.820
Coming up January 13th, we have

44:52.820 --> 44:58.500
Enlarge the Settlers, Heritage of Kings, Legends for PC by Ubisoft.

44:59.380 --> 45:04.660
Then, three games that are all the same for Xbox, PC, PS2, Rugby Challenge 2006,

45:04.660 --> 45:07.000
because it's all about men getting each other bloody.

45:08.000 --> 45:11.320
Unfortunately, I don't think that game's going to have any blood so...darn.

45:12.000 --> 45:15.040
31st, Top Spin for Game Boy Advance.

45:15.920 --> 45:21.220
Other games that are undated, we have Dragon Ball Z's Supersonic Warriors 2,

45:21.220 --> 45:24.740
Sega Classics collection which is actually a pretty good collection Space

45:24.740 --> 45:31.980
Invaders evolution and drumroll we love Katamari about time you guys seriously

45:31.980 --> 45:38.140
the u.s. isn't getting too much as far as January releases the big ones being 25

45:38.140 --> 45:44.340
to life which I believe is coming out the third week in January as well as MVP

45:44.340 --> 45:50.620
oh six NCAA baseball college baseball those are the two big games for the

45:50.620 --> 45:55.700
Month. Painkiller Hell Wars is still to be announced because it's been shifting

45:55.700 --> 46:01.460
hands from Atari to 2k games and a lot more stuff to come in February including

46:01.460 --> 46:02.780
my favorite Full Auto.

46:02.780 --> 46:08.620
Alright. UK and US release dates for your gaming pleasure. Alright we're winding

46:08.620 --> 46:14.940
down here but first off Loki what's this about some cheat thing if it's a cheat I

46:14.940 --> 46:17.620
know you found it what the hell's going on here with Liberty City Stories?

46:17.620 --> 46:21.940
Liberty City Stories, they have this nice cheat program, it's actually a modified save

46:21.940 --> 46:27.340
game that you use as a trainer, and you actually have a bunch of different cheats you can toggle

46:27.340 --> 46:29.080
on and off.

46:29.080 --> 46:33.460
This right here is basically what I play when I'm sitting at home.

46:33.460 --> 46:37.680
You can actually, some of the cheats that they've created so far, unlimited health,

46:37.680 --> 46:41.960
heavy motorcycles, which is my favorite, basically you can crash through anything if you're on

46:41.960 --> 46:44.880
a motorcycle.

46:44.880 --> 46:50.120
Basically what the main part of this is that they've actually been able to launch their

46:50.120 --> 46:56.240
own homebrew kind of code on this game saves which is important because if you're able

46:56.240 --> 47:03.000
to launch it on game saves you're able to launch this on 2.6, 2.5, 2.01, all these different

47:03.000 --> 47:06.440
things and that kind of opens a huge door to homebrew stuff.

47:06.440 --> 47:09.400
But if you haven't gotten it already, if you already have Grand Theft Auto Liberty Cities

47:09.400 --> 47:14.200
Stories, I highly recommend that you download this cheat program for Liberty Cities, it's

47:14.200 --> 47:16.600
It's just a save file, you load it up.

47:16.600 --> 47:18.080
It's a lot of fun to play with.

47:18.080 --> 47:20.280
Alright, sounds good.

47:20.280 --> 47:22.920
Anything else you got for us tonight, Loki?

47:22.920 --> 47:26.260
The other thing I have tonight is actually kind of a rumor.

47:26.260 --> 47:30.800
It's basically this thing that Nintendo's kind of trademarked.

47:30.800 --> 47:33.560
It's called Nintendo Floor Vision.

47:33.560 --> 47:38.360
And a lot of people are kind of wondering what the hell is Nintendo Floor Vision.

47:38.360 --> 47:41.440
And obviously the first thing that comes to mind is, hmm, maybe it's something that has

47:41.440 --> 47:43.300
to do with the revolution.

47:43.300 --> 47:47.300
Maybe it's something has to do the revolution being I don't know stereoscopic 3d

47:47.900 --> 47:53.960
One of the things that they think on joystick.com is that it's actually kind of something that we saw like e3

47:54.020 --> 48:01.860
One of those kind of LCD panels where you can step on it and interact with you as you're stepping on different panels

48:01.860 --> 48:04.400
I'm not sure if this is actually something that's going to be happening

48:04.400 --> 48:08.420
But so what like the next next generation of DDR where the arrows move around the pad

48:08.420 --> 48:11.420
Something like that, but that's what they're thinking.

48:11.420 --> 48:14.420
I'm thinking it has something to do with the whole Revolution thing.

48:14.420 --> 48:17.420
Honestly, we're not going to know until E3.

48:17.420 --> 48:25.420
I seriously think, though, they're going to surprise us with what this other secret about the Revolution is.

48:25.420 --> 48:28.420
I'm very, very excited about it.

48:28.420 --> 48:33.420
Well, from the Revolution finally tonight to something very, very old school,

48:33.420 --> 48:39.540
Um, rumors abound out there that, uh, there is a Pong movie in development for a late

48:39.540 --> 48:49.300
2006 theater release, um, supposedly being directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, I, it is supposedly

48:49.300 --> 48:54.420
written by Steven E. D'Souza, who's writing Tomb Raider, who, I'm sorry, who wrote, uh,

48:54.420 --> 48:55.420
Bullshit!

48:55.420 --> 48:57.420
Laura Krip, Tomb Raider.

48:57.420 --> 49:00.220
I, huge grain of salt with this one, kids.

49:00.220 --> 49:07.180
I think there's just a little too convenient that it's directed and written by folks who

49:07.180 --> 49:13.300
are doing a lot of other video game movies and late 2006 release, you'd have to be jamming

49:13.300 --> 49:15.900
on that movie to make it out late 2006 at this point.

49:15.900 --> 49:20.180
I'll tell you what, if you believe in the Pong movie, I've got some igloos to sell you.

49:20.180 --> 49:25.100
We could be surprised wrong, but I just, huge grain of salt with this.

49:25.100 --> 49:29.580
I'm not exactly going to comment on whether this is a good or bad thing because I don't

49:29.580 --> 49:33.180
think it's really put it this way I'd be I'd be able to believe it a little bit

49:33.180 --> 49:38.340
more if it had we bowl attached to it but since it doesn't I'm gonna have the

49:38.340 --> 49:42.940
call that this is really stupid and a dumb attempt to make a joke about him

49:42.940 --> 49:48.860
now comes out you're gonna look like an ass exactly however though I do have to

49:48.860 --> 49:52.660
say though since they did announce that pac-man the movie is actually gonna

49:52.660 --> 49:57.140
happen you know I'm about to believe anything right about that man the

49:57.140 --> 49:58.580
cartoon it makes sense to me

49:58.580 --> 50:01.900
all right why the fuck do they need pac-man the movie

50:01.900 --> 50:07.180
I said we had pac-man fever the song we've had it all listen they said that

50:07.180 --> 50:10.580
they might not even be a CG movie it might be live-action

50:10.580 --> 50:13.980
that would be stupid exactly stupid

50:13.980 --> 50:17.460
listen people honestly you're worried about you're wondering why

50:17.460 --> 50:21.000
people are not going to see you know it'll be like puppets like team america

50:21.000 --> 50:21.740
world please

50:21.740 --> 50:26.380
with forget it it's gonna be stupid no matter what you do this

50:26.380 --> 50:29.900
I'd say we're gonna wrap it up here with our final thoughts Loki

50:29.900 --> 50:35.300
my final thought is I have 13 shots in me and I'm doing good

50:35.300 --> 50:38.340
my final thought is I'm I'm I'm

50:38.340 --> 50:41.220
feeling much better and I think I'm gonna get a little bit of food now

50:41.220 --> 50:44.300
dark soccer your final thought

50:44.300 --> 50:48.460
as usual reject false icons and stop watching TV

50:48.460 --> 50:54.580
oh and I have one more thing to add Xbox Live if you do have an Xbox 360 a lot of cool

50:54.580 --> 50:56.220
demos that they've added lately

50:56.220 --> 50:59.500
Condemned and Quake 4, definitely check those out.

50:59.500 --> 51:03.380
It's a really good thing to be able to check these games out before you actually buy them.

51:03.380 --> 51:06.660
Okie, show's over. Sorry, alright. Have a good one!

51:06.660 --> 51:10.900
