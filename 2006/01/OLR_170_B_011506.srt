4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. Thank you for joining us here on the second half of our show.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And, of course, we had a pretty exciting first half there.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,600
first half there we talked to freeze pop we were doing a list there the top 100

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,280
games some list there in the UK now we're gonna get to a story I know a lot

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,880
of you guys are very eager to hear about because we have a lot of listeners that

9
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:43,520
have stuck with us through the music gaming focus mm-hmm I thought we were

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,520
talking about Oregon Trail the MMO no that was that was last month so that

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,160
that jokes getting smoldy there just kidding I know we're gonna talk about

12
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,040
DDR supernova dance dance revolution supernova love it or hate it because I

13
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,480
I know we have both types of people listening to the podcast, Dance Dance Revolution is

14
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,120
making a comeback and it's called Dance Dance Revolution Supernova.

15
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,880
It was announced on ddrfreak.com this week.

16
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,740
Bets and Enterprises is distributing it, although it's assumed that Konami is actually making

17
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,740
the game.

18
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:16,800
We don't know a lot outside of that, except for a logo that was also posted on ddrfreak

19
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,240
in the forums, the little red and black looking logo.

20
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,240
Should be very interesting.

21
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,560
I should also point out, most of the previous arcade versions of DDR that you've played

22
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,740
were actually quote-unquote illegal machines from Japan.

23
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,980
And DDR shouldn't be confused with the other arcade dancing game, In the Groove, that's

24
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,380
a whole other story.

25
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:43,180
But we haven't had a US release in the arcades of a DDR game since DDR USA Mix, which was

26
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:48,260
like, I want to say 98, 99, it was a long time ago.

27
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:52,620
So this one is being made in the US, it's not being made for Japanese release, or we

28
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,780
don't really know the full specifics on that, but we do know it's definitely coming out

29
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,020
for USA.

30
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,860
What do you guys think as long-time DDR fans, because I know y'all are, because Orange

31
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:04,700
Honors Radio started as kind of a music game station, what do you think?

32
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,780
Loki, is this something you're excited about?

33
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,860
It took them a long time to start over, I guess, but it should be interesting, might

34
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:17,140
get me back in the plane again, I just have to see how it is, because it could suck.

35
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,140
That's the whole thing.

36
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:23,940
gotta be they've got a second chance to do something right and they better not

37
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,980
screw it up dark Sakura my sentiments exactly except I've just been sort of

38
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:36,380
like Oh DDR is it too late to save you to bring you back into the DRL no when

39
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:40,260
it's out I'll be excited but right now because I don't know anything about it

40
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,820
and I just like I'm hoping it's not too little too late it's got to be something

41
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:51,380
impressive for me to be really excited about it honestly I'm I'm having good

42
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,940
good feelings about this I think they're gonna do a good job the whole mix is

43
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,860
recently been pretty good there's been lots of improvements but I think Konami

44
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,500
is kind of in tune with their fan base to an extent it depends which game we're

45
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,700
talking about but I'm hopeful I'm hopeful that they'll come out with a

46
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,300
large catalog of stuff I'm assuming they're gonna port stuff over from the

47
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,500
home mixes and mix it with some new stuff so I think it'll be a fun arcade

48
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,540
I'm just looking forward to getting back and going to the arcade in groups the

49
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,460
one thing the one thing I'm really hoping to get out of this is more

50
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:26,260
diversity in the music that'll be cool more diversity not just the same oh it's

51
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,220
dancy but I think the u.s. mixes have done it especially like Ultramix 3 yeah

52
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:36,380
that is that's a step in the right direction I think so but I don't know I

53
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,780
try and this is just how I am anyway I tried to reserve judgment till I

54
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,240
actually see it right all right mikle tots here by the way I know he hasn't

55
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,100
said anything yet probably because he can't because he's afraid he actually

56
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:52,260
works at Konami but obviously can't say a word about this or no no no not really

57
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:57,140
but I can say that it sounds pretty awesome from the stuff I do know so

58
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:01,980
thumbs up all right out for it and you know what the best part is though what

59
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,920
that it's being distributed by bets in that means like Dave and Buster's can

60
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:13,640
get it so you've got pump zero coming out really soon and then such and such

61
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,780
time for supernova and when they're both there you know what that means no lines

62
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:21,800
on pump zero for me is that a conflict of interest the fact that you like pump

63
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:27,680
it up so much yet no everybody knows I like pump it up more than life so all

64
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,480
right pump it up of course for those that know is the Korean dance game that

65
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,120
has five arrows instead of four it's the one that nobody cares about anymore

66
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,900
because all the in the groove people and all the DDR people fight so pump it up

67
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,840
people just kind of sit back and watch and play their game. I like it but I'm

68
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,960
not any good at it. You don't have to be good you just have to enjoy it. That's how

69
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,760
all dancing games go. It's actually easier I think to be freestyling on. Oh yeah it

70
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:59,640
feels more natural when you move. But hey, what about that DDR huh? Yeah. Yay Paul! Oh all right

71
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,040
we're gonna go. Wait wait for our little flag. I'm sure some of the listeners want to comment on this but we

72
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,640
We want to allow our listeners to comment on not just this, but anything we've essentially

73
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,240
talked about through the last show here.

74
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,400
We are opening up the Skype line for the first time on our podcast.

75
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,560
You can either go to OrangeLoungeRadio.com and click on interact with us or you can actually

76
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,600
give us a call as well, 916-226-9067.

77
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,360
But please be aware that could be a toll call depending on where you're at.

78
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,520
So ask mommy and daddy before you do that.

79
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,260
All right, let's go to the phones.

80
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,720
Who's going to be our very first caller?

81
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,720
I don't know.

82
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,440
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

83
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:40,280
Are you there? Yes. Yes, who is this? This is Zander from Florida. Hi Zander from Florida. What's your mind?

84
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,300
Am I the first? He's breaking up a little bit there. Am I the first call? Yes, you are the first call

85
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,300
But you're breaking up pretty bad there. What's on your mind?

86
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,560
Gosh I'm sorry about the breaking up thing. That's right. Breaking up is hard to do

87
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,560
Yeah, I wanted to talk about the DDR thing, of course.

88
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,560
Alright, what's on your mind about the DDR thing?

89
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,560
Here's what I think.

90
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:12,560
If it's going to work, in some way they're going to have to cater to the in-the-group audience.

91
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:20,560
Like it or not, there are going to be a lot of very upset people if in-the-group dies,

92
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,560
and this game doesn't have at least 11s, if not 12s.

93
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:31,000
So, as an In The Groove fan, which I know in previous calls to this show you've said

94
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,320
that you are, what are you looking for Konami to do to please the In The Groove fan base?

95
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,640
Are you saying more difficult 11s and 12sies or what?

96
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:47,520
More 9s and more 10s and maybe add 11s, possibly 12s, but I don't think they'd do that.

97
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,360
I mean, I'd be kind of shocked if they add 12s.

98
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,200
So is it just a difficulty thing for you or is there more to it?

99
00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:01,220
mostly it's why I quit DDR is this got boring you know can I feel that sure

100
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:06,980
okay um I don't see why Konami has to cater to the in the groove audience they

101
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:15,800
left them they abandoned them we don't want the back like you know go play your

102
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,540
game that has music that sounds the same through every song and that has steps

103
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:25,860
that are ridiculously hard. If that's what you find fun, go play in the groove. If you

104
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:30,640
want music that sounds pretty decent and you know, might not be super hard for you, go

105
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:37,640
play DDR. Listen, I'm going to come back here shockingly on the middle ground here. Now,

106
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:42,940
shhh, quiet. Anyways, what I was basically going to say is Konami, what they want to

107
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,500
do with especially a lot of these music games, they want to cater to everybody obviously.

108
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,140
So that means, not too easy, not too hard type of stuff.

109
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,760
Remember folks, there's always edit steps.

110
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,260
Always have your edits that you can put on the machines, or you can make yourself.

111
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,980
That could be any size difficulty.

112
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,580
Yeah, but how many people actually do that?

113
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,580
Not enough.

114
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:09,100
I used to when we had a fourth mix, because god knows some of those songs were just craptastic.

115
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,260
Remember the old hell edits?

116
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,740
Yeah, those ones are fun.

117
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,420
I mean, all jump rock beat.

118
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,520
That was so much fun.

119
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,620
Don't know if I don't know that I need them

120
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:23,140
I used to make these insanely hard edits and then would challenge people and if they could beat them with a decent squad by

121
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:27,060
Them dinner. Oh, that's pretty cool. All right. I want to keep it moving tonight with the calls

122
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,100
But I definitely want to give Xander a chance to say his piece. So Xander

123
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,940
well

124
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,140
Okay, I think they do indicated

125
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:43,940
Because I don't know just gonna be a lot of varying people they kill a groove with stupid

126
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:51,320
I mean it really if they're gonna have a monopoly on the dance games then they

127
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:57,880
need to cater to everybody not just mr. there that can't on one footers they

128
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,580
are catering to everybody all difficulty levels it's the vocal

129
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,000
minority that wants the tens and elevens you know you can have a couple of those

130
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,420
or whatever if there are tens and elevens but you gotta remember a lot of

131
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,720
people like sixes and sevens all right he was he was breaking up a little bit

132
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,440
there. Zander, I gotta keep moving here but I do I do wanna kinda reiterate your

133
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,360
point is I think I understand what you're saying is that

134
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,520
he's saying is that you know if Konami is going to effectively block

135
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,680
in the groove from coming out which is what it is

136
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,040
assumably intended with this lawsuit then shouldn't they

137
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,760
if they're gonna stomp out in the groove so to speak no pun intended

138
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,800
shouldn't they make

139
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,160
put in the elements that make in the groove so loved in their game

140
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,480
I don't that that's that's what I'm hearing here elements in the group so

141
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,080
So they got to steal someone else's intellectual copy.

142
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,080
Oh, stop it.

143
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,080
Stop it.

144
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,080
All right.

145
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,600
Xander, I want to give you a chance, though, for final words here.

146
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,480
Um, that's about it.

147
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,480
All right.

148
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,480
Thanks for your call, Xander.

149
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,480
Appreciate it.

150
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,120
There's actually one thing that did occur to me, though, that would completely eliminate

151
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,000
this whole 10, 11 crap.

152
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,720
Start grading it like they do Guitar Freaks.

153
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,240
With the numbers, like, going up to 100 and stuff like that?

154
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,240
Yeah.

155
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,240
Yeah.

156
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,240
That would be pretty cool, actually.

157
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,000
So that you have more of a broad scale to judge the difficulty by.

158
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But then it brings up the point, like with Neon FM, when it was coming out, you've got

159
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,200
a 55 and a 56, what's the difference between those two numbers?

160
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,400
Maybe you have like a trill somewhere in the middle of the song.

161
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,280
That would be interesting though if Konami said, you know what, screw this whole 10,

162
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,520
11, 12 business, we'll just do a whole new rating system and F this foot thing.

163
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,760
I guess we'll see pretty soon.

164
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,480
Though they did try that once with the gauges, but the gauges were retarded.

165
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,680
I think this whole scale needs to be implemented.

166
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,040
Just a reminder for our callers on Skype, always give Echo123 a call first, and I know,

167
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,520
you know, because he's been on the show before and it sounded just fine, but remember that

168
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,720
you want to call Echo123 and test your connection, just to make sure, or just pick up the phone

169
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,960
and call us.

170
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,600
So let's go to another call, and we'll go over here.

171
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,560
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

172
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,560
Hi.

173
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,040
Hi, who's this?

174
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,440
This is Tony from Washington.

175
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,760
Hello, Tony from Washington, what's on your mind?

176
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,960
I wanted to give my opinion of a new DS game.

177
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:12,780
oh sure sure what's up called trace memory in the US or another code in the

178
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:19,100
UK it's a great game what do you think what do you think about trace memory it

179
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,820
is interesting what is the what is the point a trace memory because I haven't

180
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,620
really played this game a whole lot so what exactly do you do in trace memory

181
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:32,540
basically you're this girl who on the day before her 14th birthday finds out

182
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:37,420
Finds out that her dad is alive.

183
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:42,340
Finds out that her dad is alive.

184
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,580
My friends you're breaking up here a little bit so it's really hard to understand you

185
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,660
here but I'm going to throw it back to the studio and talk a little bit here about trace

186
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,420
memory and appreciate you bringing it up here.

187
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,700
So what do you guys think about trace memory?

188
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,100
I haven't really played it.

189
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,100
I did a review on that one about three months ago.

190
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,100
Yeah?

191
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,100
I don't remember.

192
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,640
It was the one that had puzzle elements where you walk up through a village, up through

193
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,720
a house and try to put the whole thing together.

194
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,680
And I was really, really interested in it.

195
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,640
I haven't picked it up yet, just my schedule is not allowed for it.

196
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,620
But it was one that I was actually really interested in playing and I've heard nothing

197
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,620
but good about it.

198
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,060
I did play all the way through it.

199
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,480
The only problem with it was that it was really short.

200
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:31,060
I felt there was really nothing that would bring me back to it once I beat it.

201
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:35,700
They did have a lot of really cool things with the DS, like opening the DS part way

202
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,460
so you could see the reflection off both screens to solve a puzzle.

203
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,460
That was cool.

204
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,340
But, I don't know, it was a pretty good game.

205
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,940
I wish it was at least four hours longer though.

206
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,420
Alright, let's go ahead and go back to the Skype line.

207
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:53,020
Again, you can give us a call over the phone as well, 916-226-9067, or you can call us

208
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,000
on username OrangeLaunchRadio on Skype.

209
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Let's go to the phones.

210
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Hello, you're on OrangeLaunchRadio.

211
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,680
radio. Hi Sephiroth1215 here. Hi Sephiroth1215 what's on your mind?

212
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,680
A bunch of things first of all about the new DDR coming out I mean I was really

213
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,920
excited when I first heard it I mean I you know how to make sure like alright

214
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:19,440
how close are we to April Fools because that's happened before anyway. That was

215
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,880
the resounding reaction of DDR Freak and I'm like come on people they're not that

216
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,680
cruel over there especially about something like this this is something

217
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:33,320
you don't joke about? Well we are that cruel but we don't joke about that. As we

218
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:41,000
remember the big everybody is now an admin thing that went on. Otherwise I've

219
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,720
been curious about this I mean I'm sure it's gonna be a big step but um it could

220
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:53,520
also be bad we never know it could be just another bad mix but I'm kind of

221
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:59,200
hoping not that anyway but it's it's really hard to judge the game until we

222
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,400
see at least like a screenshot or know something else about it so everything

223
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:08,520
you hear is all assumptions at this point everything they could change the

224
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,640
foundation of the game for all we know now here's my only concern is remember

225
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:17,240
the last arcade game to come out and you know this is not one that's really

226
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,520
talked about a lot but dancing stage fusion in the UK another arcade release

227
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,840
that was supposed to be oh it's on brand new hardware it was just a port of the

228
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:30,600
game to the arcade it was like crap this will not be the case for this game from

229
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,200
what I know which you know I can't say what I do know but it's it you shouldn't

230
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,800
worry that much at this point all right fair enough all right anything else you

231
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,480
want to share with us to broth oh yeah this I mean obviously there's gonna be a

232
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:51,280
lot of controversy or maybe a little war between the in the group now in DDR

233
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,720
But whatever I don't really care. I mean, I'm still gonna play both of them

234
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,920
but

235
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,580
I've been wondering about the memory card slots or whatever they're gonna do for that

236
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:09,860
Because I'm thinking like if they use ps2 memory cards and they have to license to use them or to use magic gate

237
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,200
So I'm not sure about that

238
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:17,940
They could steal the idea from in the groove and use the USB thing because you can put a USB thing in your PlayStation

239
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:23,820
right yeah this yeah you could maybe I don't know oh no it would work all right

240
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,220
well separate we got to keep it moving here so I'm gonna let you go buddy but

241
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,460
thanks for calling in we appreciate it all right yeah okay have a good one I

242
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:33,100
would do one more call here on skype line tonight and then we're gonna say

243
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,420
we're done so let's go to one more call let's try one another one over the phone

244
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:45,060
hi you're on orange launch radio oh my god oh my god oh my god who's this this

245
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,060
This is, uh, Tomo Koon.

246
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:47,560
Oh, hey!

247
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,560
Hey, it's my family!

248
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,560
What's up, Tomo Koon? What's on your mind?

249
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,560
Wait, I don't believe this idea.

250
00:15:54,060 --> 00:16:00,060
I was actually just going to say something about that Xbox 360 thing and the DirecTV thing.

251
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:06,060
Yeah, what, you actually messaged me something in the chatroom about the whole DirecTV Xbox 360 thing.

252
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,560
What's going on with this?

253
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:19,560
I think it's a joke, personally, because this is not just Xbox 360, they're going to make it a Windows Media Extender.

254
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:34,560
And also, what I don't like is that during this they dropped the TiVo line, so everyone, including me and I have one of these, has to have the R15.

255
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:43,560
which is also just a piece of crap, which was supposed to promise network connectivity,

256
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,560
but the network connectivity is not only going to work with Windows,

257
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,560
they're not going to bother with their own software,

258
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,560
so me as a Mac user is left out.

259
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,560
Very interesting point, you're right there.

260
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,560
How far is Microsoft going to go to support the whole Mac thing?

261
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:09,100
but okay interesting well I what yeah and game console it doesn't have to be

262
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:14,940
your whole media center it really sounds like we're slipping into the realm of

263
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:22,340
video game corporate politics you know more of another tool to put one under

264
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:25,900
the other you know that's what it sounds like to me well I and it's interesting

265
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:30,560
because Tomokun saying you know why not just stick with the games which what you

266
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,560
know and why get into all this other stuff you know with the media center but

267
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,880
I think that's kind of where the next generation of gaming is really going

268
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,440
especially as you know games get more and more realistic and the internet it's

269
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,480
it's becoming you know one one big centerpiece in your living room so to

270
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,600
speak I do have to say that Dan sits for like an hour pulling my mp3s off my

271
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:57,880
computer through the Xbox just listening to stuff in the living room when I'm in

272
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,200
the other room all I can say is thank goodness for Nintendo keeping us with

273
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:07,680
just games and not all this extra crap amen so far all right Tomokun oh yeah

274
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:14,160
what I was gonna say anything else you want to share with us yeah I just was

275
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,320
gonna say I don't think that's gonna be executed well enough because if anyone's

276
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:27,520
to use one of the new boxes like me it's it's horrible to use it'll probably kill your xbox

277
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,400
well we'll see we'll see all right well thanks so much for calling in tomocoon appreciate it

278
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,480
thanks have a good one it was some of those xboxes you can sneeze on them it'll kill them

279
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:44,080
yeah it's kind of a bsod all right well thank you guys for calling in we'll open up the

280
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,720
skype line a little later if we have some more time but i don't know because we're kind of

281
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,960
kind of running over tonight, we'll see. For now though, let's talk about Xbox 360.

282
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,440
Loki, one of the surprise hits of Xbox 360 is not something that's on store shelves,

283
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,520
it's Geometry Wars.

284
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:04,520
Yep, Geometry Wars Retro Evolved has actually been downloaded, at least the trial has been

285
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:11,560
downloaded over 200,000 times and they've sold 45,000 copies of the game, which is pretty

286
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,700
unheard of for an Xbox Live arcade game.

287
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:19,440
What's really cool though is this is starting kind of a new trend of games that are being

288
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:25,840
developed in between $10,000 and $100,000 and are doing really well.

289
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:32,160
Kind of reiterates the point that it's not just graphics, it is actually gameplay that

290
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,200
makes a good game.

291
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,180
Somebody asked me not that long ago, why is it that you're so desperate to get your hands

292
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:50,020
on Xbox 360, I'm like Geometry Wars and Smash TV co-op. It's cool! It's really a good thing

293
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,400
that they're doing. A lot more stuff. I know that one of the other titles that they're

294
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:59,060
talking about coming to Xbox Live's arcade is like Worms, the classic Worms, and they're

295
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:03,660
going to have Street Fighter 2 of course. So lots of stuff coming to it. Of course that

296
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,620
that means the prices are going to be going up on those,

297
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:09,020
so I don't like that, but it's still,

298
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,940
it's a really good concept that they have there,

299
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,620
and I think you're gonna see a lot of people

300
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,520
trying to copy it.

301
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,400
All right.

302
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,900
Now, we always invite your feedback,

303
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,740
and so that means we can open up the Skype line sometimes,

304
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,240
or sometimes we're watching our chat room

305
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,560
at orangehonestradio.com.

306
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,100
Sometimes we're reading the mail.

307
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,360
It's a great way for those of you guys

308
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,780
that are listening to our podcast form of the show

309
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,620
to interact with us.

310
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,420
Now, just a footnote, we are gonna be changing

311
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:36,860
email address this this week even if you're still using to go we'll put a

312
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,500
forwarder in so it still works but since the orange launch radio to go edition

313
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:45,200
doesn't really exist anymore the new email address will be mailbag at orange

314
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,120
launch radio comm so if you want to send us an email it's mailbag at orange

315
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,380
launch radio comm but it still all works the same dark Sakura gets her hand in

316
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:57,720
there digs in deep and pulls out the mail so dark Sakura what's in the mail

317
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:04,720
bag. You make that sound so dirty. Oh my. I have to make sure people are paying attention.

318
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,520
Well, just to go ahead and make a quick disclaimer, by the way, the email that we received has

319
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,880
now tripled in the past two weeks on average. Awesome. So, I apologize if I don't get to

320
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:21,040
read everybody's email that is sent to me. I do read it, and I try to reply to as many

321
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,120
of them as possible. I try to get in there and read it too, but I honestly don't always.

322
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,440
somebody has something they have to share with me you can find my email

323
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,200
address on the site but you know filter through Jamie because you know she it's

324
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:37,720
that's her thing well this one comes from Chupa thingy I'm sorry I still love

325
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,520
that is that like those old lollipops Chupa Chupa wait a minute I that's

326
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,880
versus blue that's right I had this exact same conversation thingy all right

327
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:51,860
what's up Puma um but I got a response response email worries you know

328
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:56,440
Thanking us for saying that he's absolutely awesome and cool for having my little pony

329
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,440
killer.

330
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:03,620
Basically, just to give this to one server, firstly let me say that I don't understand

331
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,420
why the IRA cares about transactions and MMOs.

332
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,420
It would be just like taxing play money transactions.

333
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:12,340
I guess it would be like taxing monopoly money.

334
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,340
I bought Boardwalk.

335
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:16,480
I better send George 20 bucks.

336
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,080
One pay per dollar.

337
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,500
Sure the play money has market value, but who cares?

338
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:31,020
Secondly, about the external Xbox 360 HDD DDDD drive, maybe we will be seeing some third-party

339
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,860
peripherals like that so the crappy Microsoft versions would not be able to dominate the

340
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,860
market.

341
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,060
Can you say third-party hard drives?

342
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:41,660
Also let me say that I am the first person in all the state of Montana to pre-order the

343
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,660
Snoopy game.

344
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,660
You rock!

345
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:48,060
You are hardcore, my friend.

346
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:51,340
Sadly I will probably not be the last as well.

347
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:54,920
With the release of Street Fighter 2 over the Xbox Live Marketplace, do you think this

348
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,020
will be the start of classic Capcom re-releases?

349
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:02,820
Personally, I would love to play high def versions of 8-bit Mega Man games on my 360.

350
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:06,460
Lastly, what is the deal with the name of the Bandai Namco merged company?

351
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,920
I would have expected something more along the lines of Bonco or Namdai or some original

352
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,920
name.

353
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,920
I like Bonco.

354
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,920
Bonco.

355
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,920
Bonco!

356
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,920
I kind of like Namdai.

357
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,180
You cannot handle the Bonco!

358
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,380
I kind of like Namdai.

359
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:26,840
That is a very, though I have to say, Japanese-y thing to do with combination and shortening.

360
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,080
We need to bring back the poll on our website.

361
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,940
What's better, Banco or Namdai?

362
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,200
We'll see, anyway.

363
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,680
We also have one of our, I don't think I've received an email from this person before,

364
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:42,800
someone named Matthew has asked if we could talk about F.E.A.R. for the PC and are there

365
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,840
any upcoming sequels or is it coming to any console platforms?

366
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:51,120
I'm gonna be honest with you Matthew, we're human and we work day jobs as well as doing

367
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,120
the show so because of that we don't have time to play every single game that comes

368
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,200
out so unfortunately I've never touched the game F.E.A.R.

369
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:03,080
I've heard about it, it looks neat, I just can't afford it and amongst all my other gaming

370
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,080
obsessions.

371
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,440
Loki you look like you know something about the show.

372
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,920
I know of F.E.A.R. and I know it's a really kickass first person shooter, having played

373
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:16,400
it, the only real interaction with F.E.A.R. that I've had is watching Panics from Roosterteeth

374
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:25,840
which, you know, known for Red vs. Blue, so definitely check that out because that's hilarious.

375
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,480
But yeah, I think it is coming to the 360, probably something that's either going to

376
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:34,280
be late this year or next year, but it's definitely a game that's going to be ported over at some

377
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,280
point.

378
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,280
Alright.

379
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:42,880
Macman also points out that Apple says they're working with a new company later to be revealed.

380
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,440
theory is that Apple and Nintendo are working together on the revolution

381
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,920
because they've both released cube-shaped systems I it's a crazy

382
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:58,040
theory and obviously not the right reason but don't put anything past

383
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:03,160
those guys if any company is going to be sneaking behind your back it's those two

384
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,600
well there is a mention in here Apple said they're making a move toward the

385
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,600
gaming market and the iMac Mini G6 hooks up to your TV.

386
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,600
Interesting, why do you never know?

387
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,600
Dot dot dot. Alright, anything else in the mailbag?

388
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,600
Actually, one of our listeners, Mike, wants

389
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,600
to know about where we import from.

390
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,600
Well, just a few of my favorites, but more he's asking

391
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,600
are modchips hard to install, more like for GameCube. You don't need to put

392
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:39,400
a mod chip in your GameCube at all. There's a disc you can get to swap them out.

393
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,920
I actually have a legitimate Japanese PlayStation 2 because I didn't want to risk mod chips

394
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:47,560
you know back when it was early so I hear they're okay now but I just didn't want to

395
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,920
risk it so I have an authentic Japanese PlayStation 2.

396
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,160
But I actually did email him back some sites and if anyone wants to talk to me in the chat

397
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:58,480
room I'll mention some just not on the air. No free advertising. No free advertising.

398
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,400
However I'm sure that any number of those sites will ship to Canada. Oh yeah sure business

399
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,400
business.

400
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,400
Oh, yeah.

401
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,400
If you can make the money, they will do so.

402
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,240
I got a few actually about things that we have already or are addressing within the

403
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,720
show.

404
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:20,380
One last one that I want to approach is from our listener, Jeremy.

405
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:23,720
I think this is the first time I've gotten an email from him too, so welcome to the Mail

406
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,720
That.

407
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,720
Hooray, new emailers.

408
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,400
He's actually, though, I think on our forums too.

409
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,400
Okay.

410
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,320
But he wants to say how much he enjoys the podcast.

411
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,320
Thank you.

412
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,540
that we do a great show. I'm wondering, since we're changing our format, if the live show

413
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,740
will be able to be...

414
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:41,940
if you can listen live through the PSP.

415
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,340
I'm not so sure that it's got the... it doesn't have the capability for that.

416
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:49,240
No, but anything's possible. All it would have to be able to do is

417
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,580
basically essentially how Winamp does it.

418
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:55,020
Yeah, streaming audio how Winamp does it. Because you can listen...

419
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:59,740
We use Live 365 to do our live stream and you can load that in Winamp.

420
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,440
So if

421
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,760
When AMP is ported to the PSP, it could happen, but Loki, you're saying no count on it.

422
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,560
Why is that? It's just, they won't do it.

423
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,840
Until, the only way that it would be feasible to do that is when there's a new firmware

424
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,680
that supports

425
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,000
Flash, and then you could do a Flash player for

426
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,720
Live 365, because I know that exists. I've tried to come up with a way to do it, but

427
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,360
no, you're not going to be able to do it with just JavaScript, so unfortunately,

428
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,880
no, the only way you're going to be able to do it is the podcast for now.

429
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,000
Yeah, and the last bit of this email is also the pot

430
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,160
I'm just gonna read it also the podcast week of 1 906 to 1 1506

431
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:42,220
She said they I forgot who is bringing a Sega Genesis game beggar prince to America

432
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:47,360
I honestly don't see why they are doing that just seems like a waste of money. Not that many people have their Genesis anymore

433
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,320
I'll give one of our other

434
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:55,000
Podcast buddies a plug here because he actually has somebody from that team who's putting out that game tonight

435
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,700
I check out Bobby Black Wolf this week, allgames.com slash podcast, because they're actually interviewing

436
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:06,600
one of the people that is behind that game. So check it out, and I will be, because I'm

437
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,800
curious about that same thing. How are they going to, 42 bucks?

438
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:14,240
Those of us who have a Nomad will be happy. And if you don't have a Genesis, you know,

439
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,820
if you still have a Dreamcast, there's always Under Defeat, which is another game that was

440
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:22,760
actually being brought up for the Dreamcast relatively soon.

441
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:27,740
not give up on those old systems they're still making 2600 games this is true

442
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:32,540
this is true all right so we're gonna go ahead and close up the old mailbag here

443
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:35,860
but dark soccer you're not quite finished with us just yet because you

444
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:39,180
have a story about Dragon Quest and the revolution

445
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:46,580
woohoo kinda, sorta, maybe. Well, Udi Yuji who was the the project lead in the series

446
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:53,420
producer for Dragon Quest 8 he was actually at a launch event in Europe for

447
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:57,320
that actually is in London and said that he was very excited about the

448
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:04,660
revolutions controller and and touched on more global views for selling Dragon

449
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:08,700
Quest did you ever play that Dragon Quest game with the actual sword that

450
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,820
you could use this this makes total sense to me because remember that Dragon

451
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:15,180
Quest game to actually have the sword that you could wave around it's almost

452
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:19,500
just like this whole revolution concept you know what what this is gonna sound

453
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,020
really awful being the gamer that I am I have never played a single Dragon Quest

454
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:27,660
game Wow gasps that's really interesting but I mean well we all a minute we

455
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:32,420
playing guardian legend I didn't see Star Wars toys in college I haven't seen

456
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:35,660
Star Wars except for one of them see well there you go you want to know what's

457
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:39,300
that we all have our things where was was my first movie I was one years old

458
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:45,480
Wow well okay wait back to back to me back to uh back to Dragon Quest okay so

459
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,920
Dark Sakura Miklotov you know a game I'm talking about yes yes yeah look over

460
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:56,220
here then the game yeah the game where you have the sword it's like you go up

461
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:59,480
to the TV slash yeah it's really cool looking so this doesn't surprise me at

462
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,000
all but I hope this means we'll you know see you know some Dragon Quest games on

463
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,160
the revolution I'll be kind of cool or Zelda with the sword you just made me

464
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:11,880
think about something though playing a rod caliber yes you can play soul

465
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,240
caliber with the fishing rod on the dreamcast just thought I'd let you guys

466
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:21,080
know but there's a just to read one of the quotes from this article says when I

467
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:25,120
was making manga I met with the technology of computer games he told

468
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,520
journalists I love the fact that it was interactive and that you could do

469
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,720
something and you get feedback I thought it was an interactive story where you

470
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,760
could get feedback and rewards from everything that you do be interesting I

471
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:39,080
like the idea of interactivity with the hardware so there when you mention the Nintendo controller

472
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,840
it's a new interface and it's exciting to have that kind of reaction.

473
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,680
You do something and it reacts to you.

474
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:49,240
It's human nature to have something feedback from your actions that's rewarding.

475
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:53,340
Very interesting so we'll see what they decide to produce on the revolution.

476
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:56,280
Loki you have some more information on what's going on with the revolution.

477
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,080
Some of it rumors, some of it facts, what's going on?

478
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:03,240
Some of the stuff, I'm going to consider most of this rumor for now.

479
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:07,600
Well first off, they had a survey that went out to a couple of gaming sites, one of them

480
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,360
being classicgaming.com I believe, and it was talking about the virtual console that

481
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:16,520
they were going to be using as kind of like their storefront for all these retro games

482
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,320
that you're going to be able to play and download to your system.

483
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,920
And they're kind of showing some mockups of what the system is going to look like.

484
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,440
They have basically where you can choose the different consoles, kind of very similar to

485
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:35,520
like a game tap type of thing. Get the rent or buy games. You can do it, you know, buy

486
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:41,040
each game individually kind of like the Xbox Live Arcade or you can pay a subscription

487
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:48,040
fee and actually be able to download whatever for that month. So I thought that was pretty

488
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:56,480
cool and it kind of ties into that. They have a patent that was actually filed for their

489
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:02,720
virtual console and it kind of covered a few things about how the emulator is going to

490
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,720
work.

491
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:08,800
Basically, they're saying that the emulator is actually not going to be downloaded to

492
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,660
the system, it's not going to be on the system the entire time that it will actually kind

493
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:18,300
of download either with the games or will be on some sort of DVD type of thing.

494
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:22,540
The other thing that it's talked about is you can actually, they will be able to emulate

495
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:30,060
Possibly the portable game systems, of course like Game Boy and stuff, possibly DS titles.

496
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:36,740
Also they were saying that the emulation system may be used with other consoles, not necessarily

497
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:43,340
the Nintendo Revolution, which brings to the point maybe they're going to license this

498
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,940
to other people or something like that, which is quite interesting.

499
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:53,180
And also I think we mentioned this a while back on some of the mockups for the revolution

500
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,140
where it said choose character.

501
00:32:55,140 --> 00:33:02,060
It covers a patent for replacing characters in legacy games, basically being able to use

502
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:06,220
your own avatar say in Super Mario Brothers so you'll be able to play it as Link or Samus

503
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:12,980
or something like that, which is interesting.

504
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,180
There's some rumor mill stuff.

505
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:17,380
The other thing though that they did mention though was the list of titles that were going

506
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:22,760
to be kind of the launch titles for this virtual console.

507
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:29,460
Some notable ones for the NES, everybody's dying to get this, Kid Icarus.

508
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:33,620
And I was kind of surprised that the Super Nintendo, they actually have some of the Super

509
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:42,180
Soap 6 games, Battle Clash, the actual Super Soap 6 game, and some other stuff, Super Metroid's

510
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,180
awesome.

511
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:49,500
Of course, Nintendo 64, you've got to have, you know, um, Pilot Wings, Pokemon Snap, Paper

512
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,260
Mario, and Goldeneye.

513
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,260
Sweet.

514
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:57,440
Now, um, through the magic of radio, I actually ran out to go pee while you were talking,

515
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,980
so um, did you get-

516
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,020
You're listening to KTMI!

517
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,660
Did you get to the DS redesign one?

518
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,660
Because I'm curious about that, too.

519
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,660
No, not yet.

520
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,540
Alright, well, I want to hear this.

521
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,540
Jumping to conclusions.

522
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:11,820
Sorry, I just, you know, I'm like, okay, you know, we get it, and Nintendo's going to let

523
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:16,180
us download old games and we can be all fanboyish about what games, but we still don't know

524
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:21,460
shit until E3 really, so this is all redundant to me, no offense, I appreciate you bringing

525
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,460
the news.

526
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,980
Okay, now the whole redesign of the DS, nothing official has been announced yet, that's happening

527
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:30,740
tomorrow or actually on this Monday, the 16th is when it's...

528
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,540
Or maybe yesterday, depending on when you're listening to this.

529
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,540
Yeah, it depends on when you're listening to this.

530
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:38,660
It'll actually be announced on the 16th, they're supposed to be making an official announcement

531
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:43,620
about the redesign. Some of the things that they're suspecting are going to be part of

532
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:49,700
this announcement is pink, all pink. No, that's going to be more of a rounded kind of a cell

533
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:57,180
phone like design and free voice over IP calls. It's basically going to have that built into

534
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:03,820
it now. The Nintendo gauge. Seriously. No, but the other thing, there are some mock ups

535
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:08,620
people have done with interesting ideas for it where they're seeing the console fold down

536
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:15,020
to almost like a Game Boy SP type of design, kind of like a little small case.

537
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:19,300
I thought that was a really cool design, of course that was all fan done, but we'll hear

538
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:24,100
more, we'll probably have more next week about this and when the announcements are going

539
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,100
to be made.

540
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:29,020
Basically we know that the system is selling like crazy in Japan, they can't keep it on

541
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,020
shelves so.

542
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:35,100
I thought I read a story this week though that the PSP finally outsold it for a week

543
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,100
somewhere.

544
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,100
I thought I read somewhere.

545
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,100
Only because they didn't have any.

546
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,320
sold out.

547
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,200
Anyways.

548
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,300
Don't try to make that system sound like it's better than the DS. No, I'm just saying,

549
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,880
I'm just reporting it.

550
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,300
Alright, speaking of Nintendo and DS, if you have Animal Crossing DS,

551
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,760
hurry up and take your butt on Wi-Fi because there's actually a little

552
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,400
special present that you can get right now,

553
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,360
and if you go on Wi-Fi, you can just open your gate and close it,

554
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:05,080
but if you go on Wi-Fi you're going to get a message, a little piece of mail in your box,

555
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:09,220
from the president of Nintendo and enclosed is a Mario coin

556
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:13,340
I have a Mario coin. And when you tap the A button next to the Mario coin it goes

557
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:17,520
wing, wing, just like it did in the old school Mario Brothers and it's so stupid yet so

558
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,080
cute

559
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:22,820
That's exactly how you can sum up Animal Crossing it's so stupid yet so cute

560
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:25,080
And it raises your HRA score because it's a rare item

561
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:29,320
I haven't tried selling it yet though. Good point. Oh, I wonder how much it would sell for. I have a loan just to pay off.

562
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,320
I'll look in my strategy guide. Alright.

563
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:40,700
Now, as you know, last week on Orange Launch Radio To Go, our podcast, we phased out Dark

564
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:44,220
Soccer's advice column because you guys are just too smart.

565
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,920
You know everything, or at least you think you do.

566
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:51,700
I've taught them everything I know from controlling runaway camels to untangling Christmas lights

567
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,940
and climbing out of chimneys.

568
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:58,060
So to replace it, we're going to be bringing over one of our favorite segments from the

569
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,060
live show.

570
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,580
We're going to be changing it a little bit because we've got to reduce it for time, but

571
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:06,780
We're going to be bringing over Dark Sakura's F.U. of the Week.

572
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,100
This is the part where we have to get a little bit angsty.

573
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,340
Now, chat room, usually you guys submit your F.U.s.

574
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:15,620
We're going to get to that during the special live program later on in the night.

575
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,840
This is just for right now.

576
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,620
We're going to do some F.U.s, because damn it, we're angsty.

577
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,620
Right, Dark Sakura?

578
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:28,620
OH YEAH!

579
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,220
My F you tonight

580
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:37,860
occurred on the way to the show.

581
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:41,600
F you to people who think that they can pull out of parking lots in front of the

582
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,620
oncoming traffic.

583
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:46,700
As in stupid... and also people who decide that they

584
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,860
don't want to be in the lane they're in and so they're halfway in that lane and the other.

585
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:57,520
I experienced the two together today one stupid person in this old like beat up looking Cadillac

586
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,880
was halfway in the turning lane that I needed to be in and halfway in the going forward

587
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,520
lane and then this car decides he's gonna turn in and completely block for wrestling

588
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:14,120
I'm like uh-uh I nose my way up in the silver Lancer of love if this if this were burnout

589
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,900
This guy would be dead meat.

590
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:23,400
I've nosed up, I pointed at the man and said, you back up, and he just gave me this look

591
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,960
of utter surprise and did it.

592
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,960
I was like, that's right, you bow down.

593
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:32,000
And then, my car being the most nimble and beautiful vehicle in existence managed to

594
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,520
navigate around the evil Cadillac.

595
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:39,880
I do not know how I did it, because I had almost no clearance, and I am here and I was

596
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,880
here early.

597
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,880
So...

598
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,880
FU to morons on the road.

599
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,880
Alright, Loki, you're FU of the week.

600
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:56,880
Um, basically, my only FU is gonna be that, you know, I have to wait some time to actually get full auto.

601
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,880
I wanna know.

602
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:07,880
My FU is to the lack of Xbox 360s. Damn you, Microsoft, for not putting enough out there, and damn you, eBayers, for fucking it all up.

603
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,880
Mikotov, do you have an FU?

604
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:15,920
Sure if you did not having tomorrow off like everybody else in the world. I work for a bank. So I get it off. All right

605
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,960
All right

606
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,080
Hey, that was PC

607
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:31,780
All right, so that was our F use of the week I have to do something that I've promised what's that hello to mistress Tia

608
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,780
in the chat room

609
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:34,780
Thank you.

610
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:39,380
All right, don't forget, we tape our podcasts live now, everybody, if you're going, like,

611
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,380
what the eff are these people on?

612
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:45,100
All right, moving on, let's get to our next article tonight.

613
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,620
Loki, what's going on with the game Gun?

614
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,740
When's the sequel coming out?

615
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:54,380
The sequel's coming out probably either close to never.

616
00:39:54,380 --> 00:40:00,140
Yes, Gun and True Crime, unfortunately, weren't the breakout hits that they had hoped they

617
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,140
would be.

618
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:07,780
And it's rumored now that they've actually been canceled due to low sales of both games.

619
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:12,880
And actually I can kind of back this up distribution wise, anybody that's direct with Activision

620
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:19,480
right now is actually getting a nice price break on the gun and True Crime New York City.

621
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,920
They're selling them for about 10 bucks a pop.

622
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,000
Of course you have to buy like 4,000 units, but not the point.

623
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,800
The point is that the game's not selling what it's supposed to be.

624
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,680
I thought they were really good games, but apparently I was wrong.

625
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:37,360
All right, now

626
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:41,720
what's going on with Ragnarok Online? This is a follow-up to something we

627
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,720
talked about last week on the show, right?

628
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,080
Mm-hmm.

629
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:51,600
You're pounding over there, why? What's up, Logie?

630
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:55,440
Well, there is a rumor that Ragnarok Online was coming to the DS,

631
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,480
of course it ended up being another funny Photoshop.

632
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,360
So somebody actually photoshopped from Famitsu Magazine some article to make it

633
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,360
look like Ragnarok was actually coming on the DS.

634
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,480
Do you think it was someone that listens to the show that got the idea?

635
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:11,440
No. Maybe. Maybe. You never know. Doubt it. We do have listeners in Japan.

636
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,000
It's true. It's true. You never know. Alright.

637
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,960
Now I don't know who's got the article on this, but we have some interesting

638
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,920
guitar freaks. Something going on with guitar freaks in the

639
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,400
arcade style controller. Now note, this is not Guitar Hero.

640
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,280
This is Guitar Freaks, the old Konami game that some say may have inspired Guitar Hero,

641
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,280
but that's controversial.

642
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,280
What's up with Guitar Freaks?

643
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:41,680
Well, according to one of the major importers, there is news that there is a super deluxe

644
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:48,320
Japanese arcade-style controller for Guitar Freaks coming out.

645
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:53,680
To go ahead and read this quote, I'm just going to read it from here.

646
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,220
Last night Konami gave the green light for the production of the ASC guitar for use with

647
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:02,000
Guitar Freaks games, although the final specs of the guitar are not available for perusal

648
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
yet.

649
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,560
The company's website specifies that it will be modeled closely after the guitar used at

650
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,040
the Coinop GF machines.

651
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,880
Now you can't use a Guitar Freaks controller though on a Guitar Hero game.

652
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,880
That's important to know.

653
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,880
Actually, yes you can.

654
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,880
Can you?

655
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,880
I thought I read an article that said you couldn't.

656
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,880
Yes you can.

657
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,880
How?

658
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,880
You plug it in.

659
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,880
But what about the...

660
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,880
Can you only play the three?

661
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,520
You can only play an easy, but you can use it.

662
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:28,160
will work. Weird, I thought that you couldn't do it. You just can't wail hard.

663
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,040
Seriously, you can't use your whammy because you don't have one. For those folks that would rather be

664
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,880
playing Guitar Hero, now I was reading on dig.com earlier this week

665
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,520
that there's actually a mod that you can do to your controller to make it wireless.

666
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,500
So you can have a wireless Guitar Hero controller if that, you know, that wire's

667
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,360
getting in the way

668
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,320
and it's getting in the way of you thrashing about your house and, you know,

669
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,900
you know, pretending you're smashing into the guitar and everything.

670
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,240
This is a good way for you to, you know, cut loose.

671
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,360
so to speak. You remind me of one of the more embarrassing

672
00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:00,120
moments in my relationship with my husband. Oh, then you must share. You must share.

673
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:05,440
I go into the living room one day at one of our older apartments and Dan...

674
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,120
I was playing pada pada and I went off to go to the bathroom or something. I come back in

675
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,360
and Dan's got the guitar freaks controller doing

676
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:15,320
air guitar freaks to pada pada.

677
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:18,640
It was frightening. Wow.

678
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,960
Air guitar freaks. So I...

679
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,560
So I'm gonna patent that idea and sell it to Konami

680
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,600
You can try

681
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:39,960
We'll see what happens all right dark Sakura, what's going on you'd like to help tell our friends over in the UK

682
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,280
What's going on in their neck of the woods?

683
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,360
But sometimes what goes on over there affects what's over here, too

684
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:46,160
So it's very important to keep tabs on it. So what's going on in the UK?

685
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,700
Well, some of this is a little bit more universal just a couple quickies really

686
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:58,660
EA is bringing Lord of the Rings Battle for Middle Earth 2 to Xbox 360 in the summertime.

687
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:02,620
It's a real time strategy game based on the PC version that's due out on March 3rd, that's

688
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,620
in the UK.

689
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:08,020
And it will be the first Lord of the Rings game to work on Xbox Live.

690
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:15,900
It's saying it will have a new and intuitive console specific control scheme.

691
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:19,200
I like the quote in here. It says a promise is a promise EA remember that

692
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:22,860
So

693
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:24,560
Yep

694
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:29,120
Also another one that I am personally very excited about is Sonic riders

695
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:33,540
Because one of my favorite games of all time is Sonic are that's a great game

696
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:37,540
That's an amazing game right there, and I actually have Sonic are for the PC

697
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:40,140
which I still play because I

698
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:44,940
It's hard to go back and play it on the Saturn because the graphics are just so much better on the PC one

699
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,500
And I do have it on Saturn, as well.

700
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:52,320
But Sonic Riders just looks like it's, you know, Sonic R done right.

701
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,320
You know what I mean?

702
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:56,860
Like, anything that was wrong with Sonic R, Sonic Riders is doing better.

703
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:01,780
They all have these hoverboard things and basically shoot through levels that look like

704
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:03,420
they're ripped right out of Sonic Adventure.

705
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:04,420
It's pretty cool.

706
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:09,100
As long as Super Sonic Racing is in that, that song, I'll be happy.

707
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,740
You know, I have this, Sega loves us.

708
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,180
You know, loves its crowd.

709
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:15,520
it's crowd really worth the free games then

710
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:20,620
oh okay why is fantasy star delayed? I know!

711
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:25,360
I get the free games. shut up

712
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,520
I'm going

713
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,320
there was

714
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,560
there's actually also another thing in here too that I thought was kind of neat

715
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:35,040
actually makes me think of uh... arctic thunder

716
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,040
is you have a uh...

717
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,000
a trick thing going on in there

718
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,320
where you can basically you know

719
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,500
it's like almost like in the SSX games

720
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:49,120
you do like a board tricks like a

721
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:52,500
grinding turbulence you have different stuff going on

722
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:56,440
you can ride a pipe it's tricky game on it's tricky

723
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:59,680
bad joke

724
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,880
if you've ever played SSX four of the tracks listed are metal city splash canyon

725
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:07,680
egg factory and sand ruins where's casino zone because every Sonic games

726
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,560
gotta have a casino zone

727
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:12,200
well you need casino night okay there's always a casino or pinball zone or something

728
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,920
you know what the music I would love to hear in this? I would love to hear a remix of the

729
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,680
Ice Cap music from Sonic 3

730
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,400
the little disco-y dance-y one. I thought it was pretty cool. It was like

731
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,760
a transcend 16-bit. Also one other game

732
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:28,280
coming out, Sengoku Basura sequel coming out for PS2

733
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:34,000
put out by Capcom. And the original development team is

734
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,880
returning for that including Kobayashi Hiroyuki who is behind Resident Evil 4

735
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,600
and Yamamoto Makoto who was piano 3

736
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,440
which that game wasn't all that great but still. Okay I'm going to admit I've never even heard of

737
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,020
Sengoku Basara 1. What are these games?

738
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:52,220
It's...this one's

739
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:56,220
actually they...I'm trying...

740
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:59,500
it's a historical beat-em-up type game. Oh.

741
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,740
Like Dynasty Warriors or something? Yeah, but this one...

742
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:06,660
and I just know because I know several people who are into the series so I thought I would mention it

743
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:13,700
But this one, they actually have an art of one of the new characters who is Maeda Keiji,

744
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:19,820
who is a, they say a historical warrior, actually they have a year on here, 1543-1612, who lived

745
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:25,040
during the reign of Toyotomi Hideyoshi in the Sengoku period.

746
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,540
So that was pretty cool.

747
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:28,540
Huh.

748
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:29,540
Alright.

749
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:30,540
And then something about a contest?

750
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:34,460
Yes, a contest for folks in the UK.

751
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,460
Would you like...

752
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:36,460
Can I enter?

753
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:39,460
Well, this is a sucky contest. It's not fair.

754
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:45,460
Would you like to win a DS and Prince of Persia to play on it?

755
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:48,460
Well, there's a contest, and...

756
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:55,460
I was going to say something smart-ass, but unfortunately, with Prince of Persia, it's Battles of Prince of Persia, which is a card battle game.

757
00:47:55,460 --> 00:48:03,220
Yeah, but still, basically with this particular contest you can, again, win battles of Prince

758
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:05,180
of Persia and a DS.

759
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:11,340
The entry is on Yahoo UK Games, so just give it a clue.

760
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:18,220
Actually I'll go ahead and, the URL is very long, so just go to Yahoo UK and Ireland Games

761
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:20,100
and give it a hunt.

762
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:24,220
Now if you win and you heard about it from us, you're gonna have to cut your DS in half

763
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:27,360
and send half to us because you know that's our Commission so we get one

764
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:33,020
screen of your DS if you win sound fair but however however if any of our

765
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:37,440
listeners do in this contest I would like an email on that one so that we can

766
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,660
publicly congratulate you that's right and and and offer our condolences for

767
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:46,920
you having to play Prince of Persia speaking of offering our condolences

768
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,900
thank you very much for the UK update by the way speaking of offering our

769
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:56,140
condolences. Some people actually saw BloodRayne. What happened here?

770
00:48:56,140 --> 00:49:00,340
There's a few people that walked into the wrong theater, you know, that type of thing.

771
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:09,340
Brokeback Mountain was sold out. Seriously, they really were bored. But apparently, yeah,

772
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:16,260
it didn't do very well. It made barely a million dollars. Basically, BloodRayne was reportedly

773
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:23,260
set to open in 1,900 theaters. It ended up showing in less than 1,000 screens and, like

774
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:28,000
I said, made barely a million dollars. In addition, hundreds of theaters reported receiving

775
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:33,780
prints of the film that they didn't order. Needless to say, they refused to screen them.

776
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:38,600
That's a wonderful tactic. Send the prints to the theaters that won't carry it so that

777
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:45,040
they might accidentally put it on screen. In other news, Ui Bol is a giant douche. Basically,

778
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:52,440
He hates everything that has to do with Hollywood, calling them as greedy thieves.

779
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:57,520
Those greedy thieves are paying to finance your movies, ironically enough.

780
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:03,280
Also during the premier fore-blood reign, actors were brought on stage so evil can make

781
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:10,200
a little speech, but forced them not to speak because he hates when actors talk.

782
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:16,720
finally I don't know he's just really in the right business yeah he's just

783
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:22,920
stupid that's all you need to know and now did you hear the rumor about what

784
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:27,000
script you e-balls looking at right now not looking at Mel you're so I read that

785
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,840
on the internet so it must be true he may be looking at it but they're not

786
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:34,920
gonna let him touch it they better not I I have this feeling that Kojima would be

787
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:41,280
like no miklotov you you work at Konami right is there anything you can do to

788
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:45,960
make this not happen I would personally like to see it happen why I don't like

789
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:52,720
Metal Gear I think it would be a great comedy and you know we're getting Silent

790
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:57,520
Hill and that looks amazing so it's April 21st April 21st which is pyramid

791
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:01,440
heads gonna be days after my birthday so whoever wants to buy me a ticket to see

792
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,280
it so see we're gonna get a good movie why not get a bad movie in the form of

793
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,640
Metal Gear Solid I think it would be great because it's not you know no no

794
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:15,120
no no no no no no no no you know we need we need to have snake done by someone

795
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:19,000
really hot but voiced over by David hater and have David hater write the

796
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,320
script like cuz he did the x-men scripts but he's also solid snakes voice actor I

797
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:27,560
love this man not as much as my husband but I really think he's cool all right

798
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:32,620
Well, by the year 2010, there are certain to be lots and lots of video game movies out

799
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:36,400
there and hopefully one good one by then in 2010.

800
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,480
Some dude has some other predictions for what's going on in 2010.

801
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,880
DarkStalker, you were telling me a little bit about this before the show.

802
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,880
What's going on here?

803
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:53,520
Well, there's a bit of a speculative article about the game year in review for 2010.

804
00:51:53,520 --> 00:52:02,400
made me in the year 2010 yeah thank you never mind you watch TV so you don't go

805
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,280
to nobody that's gonna I don't watch TV but it's the have a life it's the show

806
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:10,720
to watch every college kid loves I know I know we're older than college kids no

807
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:15,480
I'm a college kid at heart work you know what I'm busy doing college playing

808
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:19,920
Animal Crossing all right anyway dude I'm taking flash animation what you

809
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:28,180
Well, the speculation is Sony's attempt to hang on to its thin lead in the gaming industry

810
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:32,960
by only selling the PlayStation 4 to 6 carefully chosen celebrities.

811
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:38,580
Seems like it might backfire, oooh, children's crayon drawings of the PS4 going for over

812
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:40,240
$400 on eBay.

813
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:44,000
Please tell me, for the love of God, Paris Hilton will not still be a celebrity in 2010.

814
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,260
Paris Hilton is reported to have held the new console briefly at arm's length before

815
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:48,680
throwing it in the closet.

816
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:52,080
God damn it.

817
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,080
Who made these predictions?

818
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,080
Ms. Cleo?

819
00:52:54,080 --> 00:53:01,480
Nintendo creates the Nintendo apocalypse that will like any type of game controller whatsoever.

820
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,540
How about the Nintendo?

821
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:03,540
Fuck your shit up.

822
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:07,720
Instead, you will direct the on-screen action by grabbing a household pet by the front legs

823
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:11,320
and making it do a little dance.

824
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:17,880
This is the sighting wheelbarrow controller featuring WarioWare yard work mode.

825
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:22,860
That'd be great Nintendo faithful pointed out. This is still better than a gamepad for first-person shooters

826
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:32,160
on the handheld front Sony and Nintendo continue their fight for the minds and backpacks of the nation's gamers by releasing ever larger portable consoles the

827
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:39,300
Nintendo XL with six screens a folding seat and selection of overpriced candy bars of PlayStation still ostensibly portal

828
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:45,040
Can help all forms of media including two ton cuneiform tablets. This is absurd

829
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:50,760
this is where can people read this if they is on wired wired I'll post the

830
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:53,840
link in the chat room for those of us for those listeners privileged to hang

831
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:58,120
out there all right uh we're getting towards the end of the show here and

832
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:03,200
believe it or not but you know what a good way to go out then to talk about

833
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:10,320
sex let's talk about sex let's talk about sex on the Xbox 360 not literally

834
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:14,600
sex on your Xbox 360 but Loki you probably could it's big enough on that

835
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:18,560
power supply you might be able to do something raunchy with that all right kids cover your

836
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:25,240
ears res controller time Loki let's try to keep it clean Loki what's this with HD porn

837
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:30,240
coming into 360 this has to be a load of crap right no actually the first movie that they're

838
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:34,200
bringing over there's a couple companies they're behind it the first one being arrow productions

839
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:41,680
which is bringing a HD version of deep throat very classic adult film to the Xbox 360 we're

840
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:46,720
not quite sure how they're going to do this or what format it's going to be in

841
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:50,240
whether it's I don't know but could be

842
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:55,200
my guess is probably WMV HD format

843
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,560
so Windows Media anyways

844
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:01,920
so look forward to that there's actually going to be some more info about it

845
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:07,160
DeepThroatHD.com is where you want to watch for the news on that

846
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:10,960
how do we know this isn't a load of crap just because the website's registered

847
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:15,240
I don't know, I'm taking this with a huge grain of salt here.

848
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,020
How could they possibly...

849
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:22,200
This is actually from the adult video conference.

850
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:26,880
Basically they had a DVD version and this HD version playing side by side.

851
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,880
But see, the whole thing that makes me real skeptical about this, and this is what I'm

852
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:34,200
going into for Next Company.

853
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:41,640
is actually, let's see here, it's another HD thing that they were showing, but the only

854
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:47,280
thing was that it was streaming over from Windows Media Center, so that's not exactly

855
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,280
cheating.

856
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,280
That's cheating.

857
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,160
That's not exactly playing on, you know, that's dumb.

858
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,760
That's really dumb.

859
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:58,760
So I don't know, I'm really skeptical whether it's actually going to be coming out.

860
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:02,480
I suppose it could do that, but I don't think it's going to happen.

861
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:03,520
Alright, we'll see.

862
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:07,140
Now something we know that's going to happen is that there's a conference coming up, Dark

863
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:08,140
Sakura?

864
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:09,140
Is there ever?

865
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:14,540
Well, you know me, I'm such a little horn dog, I had to find out about Sex and Video

866
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:16,900
Games Conference.

867
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:23,220
There is a conference going on in San Francisco, June 8-9th at the Nob Hill Masonic Center

868
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:30,760
that is the Sex and Video Games Conference exploring the business of digital erotic entertainment.

869
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:35,440
Examples include creating mainstream erotic games, integrating international success to

870
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:41,440
the U.S. market, emergent sex in video games and video game hardware, creating successful

871
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:47,480
online erotic games, investing in sexually themed games, alternative distribution methods

872
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:52,920
for AO games, and MMO-EG panel.

873
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,920
Massively multiplayer online erotic game?

874
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,920
Was that Orgy the game?

875
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:04,120
orgy for PC dark soccer I think you need to do some field work and attend this

876
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,160
conference and and bring back a full report

877
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:09,520
do you want to pay for it? no how much is it to go?

878
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:13,600
do we know? well you can save over 40 percent of the

879
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:17,320
registry fee

880
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:21,560
by signing in for it by May 7th 2006

881
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:25,320
early bird price is $295

882
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:28,560
through June 6, 3.95 on-site 4.95.

883
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:31,960
They better have naked chicks there. You know what that would be though?

884
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:35,200
That would be half the price of my new iMac. So no.

885
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:39,880
Alright, last thing for the night and then we're gonna call it a show.

886
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:44,360
This whole sex and video games thing makes me think.

887
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:49,140
Are video games sexy enough or too sexy? And if you're gonna say

888
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:50,280
not sexy enough,

889
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:53,640
what could they do to make games more sexy? Dark Sakura.

890
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,360
See, I think that I'm actually too sexy for the games.

891
00:57:56,360 --> 00:58:00,840
No, no, no, you misinterpreted my question.

892
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:03,320
I... you know what? You know what?

893
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:10,640
I'm gonna go back, because the old standby, our motto, applies to this.

894
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,080
Gameplay!

895
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:16,160
It is the gameplay that makes a game good. It does not have to have

896
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:21,440
hot, naked people in it, and, you know, pantsless rage, and...

897
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:26,600
it doesn't need to have all of you know I I I think it's fine to make it

898
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:29,240
attractive and I think that if the you know

899
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:35,080
I do have to say that the average gamer they market to is going to be

900
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:38,960
the 20 to 30 something year old male

901
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:42,760
who wants to see nothing but boobies you know TNA the whole time

902
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:46,360
that they can have their thing as

903
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:49,960
first of all as a just as a gamer not necessarily as

904
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:53,560
a female gamer I'm interested in how the game plays

905
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:57,920
if it looks good to go with it fine but I will sit and play Jumping Flash all day

906
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,880
Loki you know

907
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,960
I would say it's a complete waste of next-gen

908
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,080
you know just the whole next gen of gaming

909
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:13,120
we do not have HD titties in there because god damn it we need HD titties

910
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:16,520
to be on this next gen console where are my adult only games

911
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:21,820
If they have a god damn adult only rating system, I want adult games to be on the Xbox

912
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:23,820
360 and the Playstation 3.

913
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:27,760
I want my nudity and I want my extreme violence as well.

914
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:32,480
I want things that will make Jack Thompson go crazy and in fact I want the next Grand

915
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:38,260
Theft Auto to be so outrageous and bad that it's banned from half the world.

916
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:39,500
Only I get to play.

917
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:42,980
That's what I want to see because I think that's what we need and you know what?

918
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:45,260
I agree with you about the gameplay.

919
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:48,780
That's where the revolution comes in, and damn it, Nintendo needs to jump on this bandwagon

920
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:52,640
with, you know, sex games, and I can't wait to see Playboy the Mansion 2.

921
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,140
Is that the revolution, Full Frontal Unity?

922
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:56,140
Rez 2.

923
00:59:56,140 --> 01:00:01,860
All right, comments from our chat room, we have some folks, more naked males, of course,

924
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:04,980
you know, the women and gay men, you know, need some cock.

925
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:06,980
As far as the asexuals, though?

926
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:07,980
What?

927
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:08,980
They have Tetris.

928
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:12,300
Let's see, some

929
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:15,780
various comments here from Fireoboma and

930
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:20,980
GS191, more cowbell. We do need more cowbell!

931
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:26,340
Alright, on that note, I think it's about time we wrap things up here on

932
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:27,880
Orange Lounge Radio.

933
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:31,460
It was great for a show though, thank you guys for tuning in and listening or

934
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:34,740
downloading it. It was a little different, I think some of our folks who listen to

935
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:36,300
previous podcasts might be shocked.

936
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:40,060
but it's 170 that's what what I know it's episode 170 but the first of the

937
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:40,540
new

938
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:43,820
format so something new we've evolved it's like we change some of the

939
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:44,700
ingredients like leaves

940
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:47,860
you know are no longer swimming around in the ocean but we spread legs

941
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:51,340
so we had some you know technical difficulties there but everything's good

942
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:54,020
I'm I'm happy with the show so looking forward to many more

943
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:58,220
I in the future so no grand theft DDR

944
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:01,000
right evil chat room don't stop paying attention to the chair and they'll go

945
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:01,300
away
