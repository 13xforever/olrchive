00:00:00,289 --> 00:00:05,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to the podcast stream twice weekly.

2
00:00:05,471 --> 00:00:13,215
[SPEAKER_05]: To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

3
00:00:13,715 --> 00:00:16,996
[SPEAKER_05]: And now, the conclusion of episode 170 for January 15, 2006.

4
00:00:19,571 --> 00:00:21,913
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought we were talking about Oregon Trail the MMO

5
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:46,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Dance Dance Revolution Supernova

6
00:01:03,082 --> 00:01:05,403
[SPEAKER_02]: It was announced on DDRFreak.com this week.

7
00:01:05,823 --> 00:01:11,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Betson Enterprises is distributing it, although it's assumed that Konami is actually making the game.

8
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:19,690
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know a lot outside of that, except for a logo that was also posted on DDRFreak in the forums, a little red and black looking logo.

9
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Should be very interesting.

10
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:30,775
[SPEAKER_02]: I should also point out, most of the previous arcade versions of DDR that you've played were actually quote-unquote illegal machines from Japan.

11
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,761
[SPEAKER_02]: And DDR shouldn't be confused with the other arcade dancing game in the groove.

12
00:01:34,841 --> 00:01:35,842
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a whole other story.

13
00:01:37,322 --> 00:01:43,585
[SPEAKER_02]: But we haven't had a US release in the arcades of a DDR game since DDR USA Mix, which was like...

14
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,060
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say 98, 99?

15
00:01:46,281 --> 00:01:47,883
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a long time ago.

16
00:01:48,223 --> 00:01:49,984
[SPEAKER_02]: So this one is being made in the U.S.

17
00:01:50,064 --> 00:01:56,490
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not being made for Japanese release, or we don't really know the full specifics on that, but we do know it's definitely coming out for USA.

18
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,591
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think?

19
00:01:57,691 --> 00:02:04,496
[SPEAKER_02]: As longtime DDR fans, because I know y'all are, because Orange Sons Radio started as kind of a music game station, what do you think?

20
00:02:04,816 --> 00:02:06,398
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, is this something you're excited about?

21
00:02:06,778 --> 00:02:11,342
[SPEAKER_10]: It took them a long time to start over, I guess, but it should be interesting.

22
00:02:11,762 --> 00:02:13,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Might get me back in the plane again.

23
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:15,787
[SPEAKER_10]: I just have to see how it is, because it could suck.

24
00:02:16,968 --> 00:02:17,889
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the whole thing.

25
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:24,432
[SPEAKER_10]: It's gotta be, they've got a second chance to do something right, and they better not screw it up.

26
00:02:25,433 --> 00:02:26,013
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura?

27
00:02:26,654 --> 00:02:31,697
[SPEAKER_04]: My sentiments, exactly, except I've just been sort of like, oh, DDR.

28
00:02:32,697 --> 00:02:35,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it too late to save you, to bring you back into the DDR loop?

29
00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:41,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, when it's out, I'll be excited, but right now, because I don't know anything about it, and I just like,

30
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,056
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping it's not too little too late.

31
00:02:45,117 --> 00:02:48,953
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got to be something impressive for me to be really excited about it, honestly.

32
00:02:50,623 --> 00:02:52,984
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm having good feelings about this.

33
00:02:53,044 --> 00:02:54,125
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're going to do a good job.

34
00:02:54,145 --> 00:02:56,345
[SPEAKER_02]: The home mixes recently have been pretty good.

35
00:02:56,665 --> 00:03:01,067
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been lots of improvements, but I think Konami's kind of in tune with their fan base to an extent.

36
00:03:01,687 --> 00:03:02,948
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends which game we're talking about.

37
00:03:04,028 --> 00:03:05,069
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm hopeful.

38
00:03:05,149 --> 00:03:07,950
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hopeful that they'll come out with a large catalog of stuff.

39
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:12,311
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm assuming they're going to port stuff over from the home mixes and mix it with some new stuff.

40
00:03:12,331 --> 00:03:13,652
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it'll be a fun arcade thing.

41
00:03:14,192 --> 00:03:16,733
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just looking forward to getting back and going to the arcading groups.

42
00:03:18,193 --> 00:03:21,395
[SPEAKER_04]: The one thing I'm really hoping to get out of this is more diversity in the music.

43
00:03:22,655 --> 00:03:23,136
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be cool.

44
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:26,617
[SPEAKER_04]: More diversity, not just the same... Oh, it's Danzy.

45
00:03:26,817 --> 00:03:29,498
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think the US mixes have done it, especially like Ultra Mix 3.

46
00:03:29,538 --> 00:03:32,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, that's a step in the right direction.

47
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,281
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so, but... I don't know.

48
00:03:37,362 --> 00:03:38,542
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is just how I am anyway.

49
00:03:38,602 --> 00:03:40,403
[SPEAKER_04]: I try to reserve judgment until I actually see it.

50
00:03:40,683 --> 00:03:40,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

51
00:03:41,864 --> 00:03:42,124
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

52
00:03:42,526 --> 00:03:43,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Make Latav's here, by the way.

53
00:03:43,906 --> 00:03:44,867
[SPEAKER_02]: I know he hasn't said anything yet.

54
00:03:44,907 --> 00:03:46,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably because he can't, because he's afraid.

55
00:03:46,567 --> 00:03:49,448
[SPEAKER_02]: He actually works at Konami, but obviously can't say a word about this.

56
00:03:50,568 --> 00:03:51,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Or can you?

57
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:56,390
[SPEAKER_07]: No, not really, but I can say that it sounds pretty awesome from the stuff I do know.

58
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,671
[SPEAKER_07]: So, thumbs up.

59
00:03:59,331 --> 00:03:59,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Look out for it.

60
00:04:00,231 --> 00:04:01,752
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know what the best part is, though?

61
00:04:01,872 --> 00:04:02,052
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

62
00:04:02,412 --> 00:04:07,233
[SPEAKER_07]: That it's being distributed by Betsyn, so that means Dave and Busters can get it.

63
00:04:07,754 --> 00:04:12,175
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you've got Pump Zero coming out really soon, and then

64
00:04:13,163 --> 00:04:16,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Such and such time for Supernova, and when they're both there, you know what that means?

65
00:04:17,446 --> 00:04:19,267
[SPEAKER_07]: No lines on Pump Zero for me.

66
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:22,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a conflict of interest, the fact that you like Pump It Up so much yet?

67
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:30,415
[SPEAKER_07]: No, everybody knows I like Pump It Up more than life, so... Alright, Pump It Up, of course, for those that don't know, is the Korean...

68
00:04:30,836 --> 00:04:32,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Dance Game Dance Game Dance Game Dance Game Dance Game

69
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, New York!

70
00:05:00,145 --> 00:05:01,507
[SPEAKER_04]: We wave our little flag.

71
00:05:10,165 --> 00:05:12,927
[SPEAKER_02]: We are opening up the Skype line for the first time on our podcast.

72
00:05:13,368 --> 00:05:20,194
[SPEAKER_02]: You can either go to OrangeLoungeRadio.com and click on Interact With Us, or you can actually give us a call as well, 916-226-9067.

73
00:05:21,495 --> 00:05:25,239
[SPEAKER_02]: But please be aware that could be a toll call depending on where you're at.

74
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:27,180
[SPEAKER_02]: So ask Mommy and Daddy before you do that.

75
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:29,102
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's go to the phones.

76
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's going to be our very first caller?

77
00:05:30,804 --> 00:05:31,404
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

78
00:05:32,185 --> 00:05:33,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

79
00:05:33,986 --> 00:05:34,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you there?

80
00:05:35,288 --> 00:05:35,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

81
00:05:35,948 --> 00:05:36,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, who is this?

82
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Xander from Florida.

83
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Xander from Florida.

84
00:05:39,761 --> 00:05:40,401
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind?

85
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:43,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I the first call?

86
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:44,503
[SPEAKER_02]: He's breaking up a little bit there.

87
00:05:45,163 --> 00:05:45,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I the first call?

88
00:05:46,303 --> 00:05:48,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you are the first call, but you're breaking up pretty bad there.

89
00:05:48,584 --> 00:05:49,164
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind?

90
00:05:51,965 --> 00:05:53,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Gosh, I'm sorry about the breaking up thing.

91
00:05:54,026 --> 00:05:54,386
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all right.

92
00:05:54,806 --> 00:05:55,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Breaking up is hard to do.

93
00:05:58,648 --> 00:06:00,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I wanted to talk about the DDR thing, of course.

94
00:06:00,808 --> 00:06:01,089
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

95
00:06:01,149 --> 00:06:02,369
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind about the DDR thing?

96
00:06:05,385 --> 00:06:05,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's what I think.

97
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:13,068
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's going to work, in some way they're going to have to cater to the Indie Groove audience.

98
00:06:13,548 --> 00:06:23,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it or not, there are going to be a lot of very upset people if Indie Groove dies and this game doesn't have at least 11s, if not 12s.

99
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:36,422
[SPEAKER_02]: So, as an In The Groove fan, which I know in previous calls to this show you've said that you are, what are you looking for Konami to do to please the In The Groove fanbase?

100
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:40,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you saying more difficult 11s and 12s or what?

101
00:06:41,503 --> 00:06:47,425
[SPEAKER_06]: More 9s and more 10s and maybe add 11s, possibly 12s, but I don't think they'd do that.

102
00:06:47,585 --> 00:06:48,945
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'd be kind of shocked if they had 12s.

103
00:06:50,306 --> 00:06:52,927
[SPEAKER_02]: So is it just a difficulty thing for you or is there more to it?

104
00:06:54,127 --> 00:06:54,507
[SPEAKER_06]: It's mostly...

105
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:10,425
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see why Konami has to cater to the In The Groove audience They left them, they abandoned them We don't want them back!

106
00:07:13,874 --> 00:07:22,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know, go play your game that has music that sounds the same through every song and that has steps that are ridiculously hard.

107
00:07:22,657 --> 00:07:25,297
[SPEAKER_07]: If that's what you find fun, go play in the groove.

108
00:07:25,738 --> 00:07:31,479
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want music that sounds pretty decent and, you know, might not be super hard for you, go play DDR.

109
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:35,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Listen, I'm going to come back here, shockingly, on the middle ground here.

110
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:38,541
[SPEAKER_10]: Now... Shh!

111
00:07:38,922 --> 00:07:39,402
Quiet!

112
00:07:39,862 --> 00:07:40,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways...

113
00:07:41,015 --> 00:07:46,058
[SPEAKER_10]: What I was basically going to say is Konami, what they want to do with especially a lot of these music games, they want to cater to everybody, obviously.

114
00:07:46,438 --> 00:07:49,359
[SPEAKER_10]: So that means not too easy, not too hard type of stuff.

115
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:52,261
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember, folks, there's always edit steps.

116
00:07:52,401 --> 00:07:55,822
[SPEAKER_10]: You always have your edits that you can put on the machines or you can make yourself.

117
00:07:56,162 --> 00:07:58,343
[SPEAKER_10]: That could be any size difficulty.

118
00:07:58,363 --> 00:07:59,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but how many people actually do that?

119
00:08:00,504 --> 00:08:00,885
[SPEAKER_10]: Not enough.

120
00:08:01,425 --> 00:08:08,028
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to when we had a fourth mix because God knows some of those songs were just craptastic.

121
00:08:08,048 --> 00:08:08,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

122
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:11,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember the old Hell edits?

123
00:08:11,776 --> 00:08:12,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, those ones are fun.

124
00:08:12,956 --> 00:08:14,236
[SPEAKER_07]: I made it all jump rock beat.

125
00:08:14,356 --> 00:08:15,356
[SPEAKER_07]: That was so much fun.

126
00:08:15,616 --> 00:08:17,657
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know that I knew you then.

127
00:08:17,817 --> 00:08:23,558
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to make these insanely hard edits and then would challenge people and if they could beat them with a decent score, I'd buy them dinner.

128
00:08:23,998 --> 00:08:24,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's pretty cool.

129
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:29,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I want to keep it moving tonight with the calls, but I definitely want to give Xander a chance to say his piece.

130
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:30,119
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Xander?

131
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:37,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, okay, I think they do need to cater to the group because

132
00:08:38,783 --> 00:08:42,025
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, there's just going to be a lot of very angry people.

133
00:08:42,426 --> 00:08:44,247
[SPEAKER_06]: They killed Groove with the stupid lawnmower.

134
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:52,513
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it really, if they're going to have a monopoly on the dance games, then they need to cater to everybody.

135
00:08:53,014 --> 00:08:57,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Not just a misdemeanor that can't get on one-footers.

136
00:08:57,827 --> 00:08:59,328
[SPEAKER_04]: They are catering to everybody.

137
00:08:59,768 --> 00:09:00,809
[SPEAKER_04]: All difficulty levels.

138
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:38,745
[SPEAKER_02]: from coming out, which is what is assumably intended with this lawsuit, then shouldn't they, if they're going to stomp out in the groove, so to speak, and no pun intended, shouldn't they put elements that make in the groove so loved in their game?

139
00:09:38,865 --> 00:09:40,446
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm hearing here.

140
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:44,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Elements are in the groove, so they've got to steal someone else's intellectual copy.

141
00:09:44,067 --> 00:09:44,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, stop it.

142
00:09:44,747 --> 00:09:45,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop it.

143
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:45,347
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

144
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Xander, I want to give you a chance, though, for final words here.

145
00:09:48,328 --> 00:09:49,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

146
00:09:50,011 --> 00:09:50,451
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about it.

147
00:09:51,032 --> 00:09:51,352
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

148
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:52,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for your call, Sandra.

149
00:09:52,512 --> 00:09:52,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate it.

150
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:57,695
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually one thing that did occur to me, though, that would completely eliminate this whole 10-11 crap.

151
00:09:58,815 --> 00:10:00,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Start grading it like they do Guitar Freaks.

152
00:10:01,837 --> 00:10:04,238
[SPEAKER_07]: With the numbers going up to 100 and stuff like that?

153
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:04,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

154
00:10:04,698 --> 00:10:05,939
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be pretty cool, actually.

155
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:09,921
[SPEAKER_04]: So that you have more of a broad scale to judge the difficulty by.

156
00:10:10,101 --> 00:10:16,384
[SPEAKER_07]: But then it brings up the point, like with Neon FM, when it was coming out, you've got a 55 and a 56.

157
00:10:16,504 --> 00:10:18,025
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the difference between those two numbers?

158
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:21,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you have like a trill somewhere in the middle of the song.

159
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:24,882
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be interesting though if Konami said, you know what, screw this whole 10, 11, 12 business.

160
00:10:24,922 --> 00:10:28,484
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just do a whole new rating system and F this thing.

161
00:10:28,644 --> 00:10:29,865
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we'll see pretty soon.

162
00:10:29,885 --> 00:10:33,127
[SPEAKER_04]: They did try that once with the gauges, but the gauges were retarded.

163
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:37,369
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this whole scale needs to be implemented.

164
00:10:37,469 --> 00:10:39,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, this is Tony from Washington I wanted to give my opinion of a new DS game

165
00:11:07,188 --> 00:11:08,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sure, what's up?

166
00:11:08,188 --> 00:11:13,309
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called Trace Memory in the US or another code in the UK.

167
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:14,369
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a great game.

168
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,870
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think about Trace Memory?

169
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,551
[SPEAKER_02]: It is interesting.

170
00:11:21,691 --> 00:11:23,391
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the point of Trace Memory?

171
00:11:23,411 --> 00:11:26,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I haven't really played this game a whole lot, so what exactly do you do in Trace Memory?

172
00:11:27,172 --> 00:11:33,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, you're this girl who, on the day before her 14th birthday, finds out that her

173
00:11:34,758 --> 00:11:36,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Finds out that her dad is alive.

174
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:40,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Finds out that her dad is alive.

175
00:11:42,325 --> 00:11:45,908
[SPEAKER_02]: My friends, you're breaking up here a little bit, so it's really hard to understand you here.

176
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:50,172
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm going to throw it back to the studio and talk a little bit here about Trace Memory.

177
00:11:51,393 --> 00:11:53,275
[SPEAKER_02]: And I appreciate you bringing it up here.

178
00:11:53,395 --> 00:11:56,498
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you guys think about Trace Memory?

179
00:11:57,438 --> 00:11:58,039
[SPEAKER_02]: I really played it.

180
00:11:58,219 --> 00:11:59,921
[SPEAKER_04]: I did a review on that one about three months ago.

181
00:12:00,081 --> 00:12:00,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?

182
00:12:00,381 --> 00:12:00,821
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.

183
00:12:02,108 --> 00:12:09,031
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the one that had puzzle elements where you walk up through a village, up through a house, and try to put the whole thing together.

184
00:12:09,651 --> 00:12:11,692
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was really, really interested in it.

185
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:14,793
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't picked it up yet, just my schedule is not allowed for it.

186
00:12:15,493 --> 00:12:19,255
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was one that I was actually really interested in playing, and I've heard nothing but good about it.

187
00:12:19,555 --> 00:12:20,775
[SPEAKER_07]: I did play all the way through it.

188
00:12:22,056 --> 00:12:24,477
[SPEAKER_07]: The only problem with it was that it was really short.

189
00:12:25,617 --> 00:12:27,198
[SPEAKER_07]: I felt there was really nothing...

190
00:12:28,908 --> 00:12:30,669
[SPEAKER_07]: that would bring me back to it once I beat it.

191
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:38,916
[SPEAKER_07]: It did have a lot of really cool things with the DS, like opening the DS partway so you could see the reflection off both screens to solve a puzzle.

192
00:12:39,337 --> 00:12:40,177
[SPEAKER_07]: That was cool.

193
00:12:40,558 --> 00:12:42,359
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't know, it was a pretty good game.

194
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:44,561
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish it was at least four hours longer, though.

195
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,356
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's go ahead and go back to the Skype line.

196
00:12:47,696 --> 00:12:50,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, you can give us a call over the phone as well, 916-226-9067.

197
00:12:50,177 --> 00:12:55,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can call us on username OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.

198
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the phones.

199
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

200
00:13:00,262 --> 00:13:01,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Sephiroth1215 here.

201
00:13:01,622 --> 00:13:02,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Sephiroth1215.

202
00:13:02,703 --> 00:13:03,183
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind?

203
00:13:04,304 --> 00:13:05,184
[SPEAKER_03]: A bunch of things.

204
00:13:05,884 --> 00:13:07,965
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, about the new DDR coming out.

205
00:13:08,506 --> 00:13:10,887
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I was really excited when I first heard it.

206
00:13:10,947 --> 00:13:11,247
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I...

207
00:13:12,469 --> 00:13:16,612
[SPEAKER_03]: How to make sure, like, alright, how close are we to April Fools?

208
00:13:16,812 --> 00:13:18,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's happened before anyway.

209
00:13:19,053 --> 00:13:21,975
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the resounding reaction of DDR Freak.

210
00:13:22,015 --> 00:13:23,676
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, come on, people.

211
00:13:24,377 --> 00:13:26,018
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not that cruel over there.

212
00:13:26,298 --> 00:13:27,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially about something like this.

213
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:28,520
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something you don't joke about.

214
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we are that cruel, but we don't joke about that.

215
00:13:33,123 --> 00:13:36,645
[SPEAKER_04]: As we remember the big everybody is now an admin thing that went on.

216
00:13:37,806 --> 00:13:39,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, I didn't

217
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,621
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious about this.

218
00:13:42,682 --> 00:13:47,530
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm sure it's going to be a big step, but it could also be bad.

219
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:48,171
[SPEAKER_03]: We never know.

220
00:13:48,892 --> 00:13:51,877
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be just another bad mix.

221
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:53,961
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of hoping.

222
00:13:55,009 --> 00:14:02,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that anyway, but... It's really hard to judge the game until we see at least like a screenshot or know something else about it.

223
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:06,480
[SPEAKER_02]: So everything you hear is all assumptions at this point.

224
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything.

225
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,383
[SPEAKER_02]: They could change the foundation of the game for all we know.

226
00:14:10,443 --> 00:14:15,588
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, here's my only concern is remember the last arcade game to come out and, you know, this is

227
00:14:16,204 --> 00:14:23,387
[SPEAKER_10]: Not one that's really talked about a lot, but Dancing Stage Fusion in the UK, another arcade release that was supposed to be, oh, it's on brand new hardware.

228
00:14:23,967 --> 00:14:25,747
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just a port of the game to the arcade.

229
00:14:25,787 --> 00:14:27,428
[SPEAKER_10]: It was, like, crap.

230
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,389
[SPEAKER_07]: This will not be the case for this game.

231
00:14:30,489 --> 00:14:36,811
[SPEAKER_07]: From what I know, which, you know, I can't say what I do know, but you shouldn't worry that much at this point.

232
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:38,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, fair enough.

233
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:40,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anything else you want to share with us, Sibroth?

234
00:14:41,713 --> 00:14:44,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, this... I mean, obviously there's going to be a lot of

235
00:14:45,695 --> 00:14:53,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, controversy, or maybe a little war in the group now in DDR, but whatever, I don't really care.

236
00:14:54,279 --> 00:15:12,246
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm still going to play both of them, but I've been wondering about the memory card slots or whatever they're going to do for that, because I'm thinking, like, if they use PS2 memory cards, then they have to license to use them, or to use Magic Gate, so I'm not sure about that.

237
00:15:12,648 --> 00:15:13,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

238
00:15:13,869 --> 00:15:14,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

239
00:15:41,488 --> 00:15:43,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, oh my god, who's this?

240
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,470
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Tomo-kun.

241
00:15:47,311 --> 00:15:48,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh hey, it's my fanboy.

242
00:15:48,691 --> 00:15:50,292
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up Tomo-kun, what's on your mind?

243
00:15:51,513 --> 00:15:52,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, I don't believe this.

244
00:15:54,234 --> 00:15:59,937
[SPEAKER_09]: I was actually just going to say something about that Xbox 360 thing and the DirecTV thing.

245
00:16:00,497 --> 00:16:06,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you actually messaged me something in the chatroom about the whole DirecTV Xbox 360 thing.

246
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,080
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on with this?

247
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:10,662
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a joke, personally, because...

248
00:16:11,317 --> 00:16:14,600
[SPEAKER_09]: This is not just Xbox 360.

249
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,643
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to make it a Windows Media Extender.

250
00:16:21,425 --> 00:16:28,610
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, what I don't like is that during this, they dropped the TiVo line.

251
00:16:29,511 --> 00:16:37,357
[SPEAKER_09]: So everyone, including me, and I have one of these, has to have the R15, which is also just a piece of crap.

252
00:16:39,212 --> 00:16:39,552
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.

253
00:16:39,572 --> 00:16:40,432
[SPEAKER_09]: Very interesting point.

254
00:16:40,452 --> 00:16:41,193
[SPEAKER_09]: You're right there.

255
00:16:41,893 --> 00:16:45,674
[SPEAKER_09]: How far is Microsoft going to go to support the whole Mac thing?

256
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:46,375
[SPEAKER_09]: But, okay, interesting.

257
00:16:46,395 --> 00:16:46,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I... What?

258
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:46,795
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

259
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:08,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and it's a game console.

260
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,657
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't have to be your whole media center.

261
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,167
[SPEAKER_04]: It really sounds like we're slipping into the realm of video game corporate politics.

262
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:19,231
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, more of another...

263
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:24,451
[SPEAKER_04]: tool to put one under the other, you know, is what it sounds like to me.

264
00:17:24,932 --> 00:17:34,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and it's interesting because Tomokun's saying, you know, why not just stick with the games, what you know, and why get into all this other stuff, you know, with the media center.

265
00:17:34,475 --> 00:17:46,760
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that's kind of where the next generation of gaming is really going, especially as, you know, games get more and more realistic and the internet, it's becoming, you know, one big centerpiece in your living room, so to speak.

266
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,880
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have to say that

267
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:58,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan sits for like an hour pulling my MP3s off my computer through the Xbox just listening to stuff in the living room when I'm in the other room.

268
00:17:58,765 --> 00:18:03,307
[SPEAKER_07]: All I can say is thank goodness for Nintendo keeping us with just games and not all this extra crap.

269
00:18:03,587 --> 00:18:03,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Amen.

270
00:18:04,468 --> 00:18:04,788
[SPEAKER_02]: So far.

271
00:18:05,788 --> 00:18:06,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Tomokuni.

272
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:07,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah?

273
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:08,770
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

274
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,171
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, anything else you want to share with us?

275
00:18:12,972 --> 00:18:13,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I just...

276
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:25,464
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say, I don't think that's going to be executed well enough because if anyone's used one of the new boxes, like me, it's horrible to use.

277
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:27,686
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll probably kill your Xbox.

278
00:18:28,646 --> 00:18:29,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll see.

279
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:30,107
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

280
00:18:30,268 --> 00:18:30,528
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

281
00:18:30,548 --> 00:18:31,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks so much for calling in, Tomokun.

282
00:18:31,989 --> 00:18:32,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate it.

283
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:33,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

284
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:34,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one.

285
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:38,173
[SPEAKER_04]: And with some of those Xboxes, you can sneeze on them and it'll kill them.

286
00:18:38,613 --> 00:18:40,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's kind of a... B.S.O.D.

287
00:18:40,275 --> 00:18:40,595
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

288
00:18:41,576 --> 00:18:42,016
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

289
00:18:42,742 --> 00:18:43,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you guys for calling in.

290
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:47,523
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll open up the Skype line a little later if we have some more time, but I don't know because we're kind of running over tonight.

291
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:47,863
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

292
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:50,844
[SPEAKER_02]: For now, though, let's talk about Xbox 360.

293
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:55,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, one of the surprise hits of Xbox 360 is not something that's on store shelves.

294
00:18:56,365 --> 00:18:57,325
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Geometry Wars.

295
00:18:57,525 --> 00:19:07,667
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, Geometry Wars Retro Evolved has actually been downloaded at least the trial's been downloaded over 200,000 times and they've sold 45,000 copies of the game, which is

296
00:19:11,465 --> 00:19:11,945
[SPEAKER_10]: and many more.

297
00:19:35,088 --> 00:19:39,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody asked me not that long ago, why is it that you're so desperate to get your hands on an Xbox 360?

298
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:44,573
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, Geometry Wars and Smash TV co-op?

299
00:19:47,074 --> 00:19:47,734
[SPEAKER_10]: It's cool!

300
00:19:49,235 --> 00:19:50,735
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really a good thing that they're doing.

301
00:19:50,755 --> 00:19:51,896
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot more stuff.

302
00:19:51,936 --> 00:20:01,060
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that one of the other titles that they're talking about coming to Xbox Live's arcade is like Worms, the classic Worms, and they're going to have Street Fighter 2, of course.

303
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,901
[SPEAKER_10]: So lots of stuff coming to it.

304
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:13,231
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't like that, but still, it's a really good concept that they have there, and I think you're going to see a lot of people trying to copy it.

305
00:20:14,572 --> 00:20:14,832
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

306
00:20:16,828 --> 00:20:24,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, we always invite your feedback, and so that means we can open up the Skype line sometimes, or sometimes we're watching our chatroom at orangelaunchradio.com.

307
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we're reading the mail.

308
00:20:26,071 --> 00:20:30,372
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great way for those of you guys that are listening to our podcast form of the show to interact with us.

309
00:20:30,432 --> 00:20:34,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, just a footnote, we are going to be changing the email address this week.

310
00:20:35,073 --> 00:20:38,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you're still using ToGo, we'll put a forwarder in so it still works.

311
00:20:38,594 --> 00:20:44,556
[SPEAKER_02]: But since the Orange Launch Radio ToGo edition doesn't really exist anymore, the new email address will be mailbag.com.

312
00:20:44,896 --> 00:20:45,977
[SPEAKER_02]: at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

313
00:20:45,997 --> 00:20:48,940
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to send us an email, it's mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

314
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,002
[SPEAKER_02]: But it still all works the same.

315
00:20:51,062 --> 00:20:55,065
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura gets her hand in there, digs in deep, and pulls out the mail.

316
00:20:56,326 --> 00:20:58,048
[SPEAKER_02]: So DarkSakura, what's in the mailbag?

317
00:20:58,068 --> 00:20:59,849
[SPEAKER_04]: You make that sound so dirty.

318
00:20:59,869 --> 00:21:02,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my.

319
00:21:02,492 --> 00:21:03,913
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to make sure people are paying attention.

320
00:21:04,688 --> 00:21:12,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, just to go ahead and make a quick disclaimer, by the way, the email that we receive has now tripled in the past two weeks on average.

321
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,111
[SPEAKER_04]: So I apologize if I don't get to read everybody's email that is sent to me.

322
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:21,812
[SPEAKER_04]: I do read it, and I try to reply to as many of them as possible.

323
00:21:21,912 --> 00:21:24,733
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to get in there and read it too, but I honestly don't always.

324
00:21:25,093 --> 00:21:32,875
[SPEAKER_02]: If somebody has something they have to share with me, you can find my email address on the site, but filter through Jamie because that's her thing.

325
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this one comes from Chupa Thingy.

326
00:21:36,717 --> 00:21:37,897
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I still love that.

327
00:21:37,917 --> 00:21:39,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that like those old lollipops?

328
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:39,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Chupa Chupa?

329
00:21:39,538 --> 00:21:40,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute.

330
00:21:40,358 --> 00:21:41,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Red versus blue.

331
00:21:41,358 --> 00:21:41,979
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

332
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:43,759
[SPEAKER_02]: I had this exact same conversation two weeks ago.

333
00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:44,459
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll call it Chupa Thingy.

334
00:21:44,479 --> 00:21:44,920
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

335
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:45,520
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up?

336
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Puma.

337
00:21:48,461 --> 00:21:56,803
[SPEAKER_04]: But I got a response email where he's thanking us for saying that he is absolutely awesome and cool for having my little pony killer.

338
00:21:58,064 --> 00:21:58,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

339
00:21:58,504 --> 00:21:59,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that I remember.

340
00:21:59,204 --> 00:21:59,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

341
00:22:00,716 --> 00:22:06,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, just to give this to one server, he says, Firstly, let me say that I don't understand why the IRA cares about transactions and MMOs.

342
00:22:06,938 --> 00:22:09,338
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be just like taxing PlayMoney transactions.

343
00:22:09,779 --> 00:22:12,279
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it would be like taxing Monopoly money.

344
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:13,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I bought BoardWalk.

345
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,840
[SPEAKER_05]: I better send George $20.

346
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's one paper dollar.

347
00:22:18,981 --> 00:22:21,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, the PlayMoney has market value, but who cares?

348
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Secondly, about the external Xbox 360 HDDVDVDV.

349
00:22:26,883 --> 00:22:27,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Drive.

350
00:22:29,124 --> 00:22:35,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we will be seeing some third-party peripherals like that so the crappy Microsoft versions would not be able to dominate the market.

351
00:22:35,728 --> 00:22:37,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you say third-party hard drives?

352
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:42,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, let me say that I am the first person in all the state of Montana to pre-order the Snoopy game.

353
00:22:43,772 --> 00:22:44,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock!

354
00:22:45,273 --> 00:22:46,574
[SPEAKER_02]: You are hardcore, my friend.

355
00:22:48,015 --> 00:22:50,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Sadly, I will probably not be the last as well.

356
00:22:51,255 --> 00:22:57,460
[SPEAKER_04]: With the release of Street Fighter 2 over the Xbox Live Marketplace, do you think that this will be the start of classic Capcom re-releases?

357
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Personally, I would love to play high-def versions of 8-bit Mega Man games on my 360.

358
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:06,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Lastly, what is the deal with the name of the Bandai Namco merged company?

359
00:23:06,646 --> 00:23:10,989
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have expected something more along the lines of Banco or Namdai or some original name.

360
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:12,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Banco.

361
00:23:13,171 --> 00:23:13,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Banco.

362
00:23:14,332 --> 00:23:15,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Banco!

363
00:23:15,052 --> 00:23:15,873
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of like Namdai.

364
00:23:15,893 --> 00:23:16,633
[SPEAKER_02]: You cannot handle the Banco.

365
00:23:16,653 --> 00:23:17,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Banco.

366
00:23:18,243 --> 00:23:19,184
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of like Namdai.

367
00:23:20,305 --> 00:23:23,027
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a very, though, I have to say, Japanese-y thing to do.

368
00:23:24,168 --> 00:23:28,912
[SPEAKER_02]: The combination and shortening and... We need to bring back the poll on our website.

369
00:23:28,952 --> 00:23:30,854
[SPEAKER_02]: What's better, Banco or Namdai?

370
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:32,195
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

371
00:23:32,255 --> 00:23:32,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

372
00:23:32,976 --> 00:23:37,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we also have one of our... I don't think I've received an email from this person before.

373
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:45,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody, Matthew, has asked if we could talk about fear for the PC and are there any upcoming sequels or is it coming to any console platforms?

374
00:23:46,894 --> 00:23:48,075
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be honest with you, Matthew.

375
00:23:49,056 --> 00:23:51,557
[SPEAKER_02]: We're human and we work day jobs as well as doing this show.

376
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:55,380
[SPEAKER_02]: So because of that, we don't have time to play every single game that comes out.

377
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,142
[SPEAKER_02]: So unfortunately, I've never touched the game Fear.

378
00:23:58,242 --> 00:23:58,923
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard about it.

379
00:23:59,083 --> 00:23:59,763
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks neat.

380
00:24:00,244 --> 00:24:01,384
[SPEAKER_02]: I just can't afford it.

381
00:24:01,765 --> 00:24:03,646
[SPEAKER_02]: And amongst all my other gaming obsessions.

382
00:24:03,746 --> 00:24:06,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, you look like you know something about this show.

383
00:24:06,548 --> 00:24:09,971
[SPEAKER_10]: I know of Fear and I know it's a really kick-ass first-person shooter.

384
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:10,991
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't played it.

385
00:24:11,031 --> 00:24:13,393
[SPEAKER_10]: The only real interaction with Fear that I've had is

386
00:24:13,945 --> 00:24:19,690
[SPEAKER_10]: watching Panics from Rooster Teeth, which, you know, known for Red vs. Blue.

387
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,711
[SPEAKER_10]: I still laugh about that.

388
00:24:21,831 --> 00:24:24,413
[SPEAKER_10]: So definitely check that out because that's hilarious.

389
00:24:25,775 --> 00:24:34,662
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, I think it is coming to the 360, probably something that's either going to be late this year or next year, but it's definitely a game that's going to be ported over at some point.

390
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:36,243
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

391
00:24:36,593 --> 00:24:42,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Macman also points out that Apple says they're working with a new company later to be revealed.

392
00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:48,905
[SPEAKER_04]: His theory is that Apple and Nintendo are working together on the revolution because they've both released cube-shaped systems.

393
00:24:51,387 --> 00:24:55,010
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a crazy theory and obviously not the right reason.

394
00:24:56,492 --> 00:24:58,794
[SPEAKER_02]: But don't put anything past those guys.

395
00:24:59,495 --> 00:25:01,777
[SPEAKER_02]: If any company is going to be sneaking behind your back...

396
00:25:02,614 --> 00:25:03,234
[SPEAKER_02]: It's those two.

397
00:25:03,575 --> 00:25:04,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there is a mention in here.

398
00:25:04,775 --> 00:25:10,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Apple said they're making a move toward the gaming market and the iMac Mini G6 hooks up to your TV.

399
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:13,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

400
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you never know.

401
00:25:15,401 --> 00:25:16,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Dot, dot, dot.

402
00:25:16,742 --> 00:25:17,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else in the mailbag?

403
00:25:18,983 --> 00:25:26,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, one of our listeners, Mike, wants to know about where we import from.

404
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:31,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, just send him a few of my favorites, but more he's asking, are mod chips hard to install?

405
00:25:32,169 --> 00:25:33,111
[SPEAKER_04]: More like for GameCube.

406
00:25:34,092 --> 00:25:36,014
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't need to put a mod chip in your GameCube at all.

407
00:25:36,275 --> 00:25:38,097
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a disc you can get to swap them out.

408
00:25:39,479 --> 00:25:44,646
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have a legitimate Japanese PlayStation 2 because I didn't want to risk mod chips, you know, back when it was early, so...

409
00:25:45,271 --> 00:25:49,694
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear they're okay now, but I just didn't want to risk it, so I have an authentic Japanese PlayStation 2.

410
00:25:50,014 --> 00:25:55,097
[SPEAKER_04]: But I actually did email him back some sites, and if anyone wants to talk to me in the chat room, I'll mention some, just not on the air.

411
00:25:55,877 --> 00:25:56,778
[SPEAKER_02]: No free advertising.

412
00:25:56,818 --> 00:25:57,578
[SPEAKER_04]: No free advertising.

413
00:25:58,439 --> 00:26:01,741
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I'm sure that any number of those sites will ship to Canada.

414
00:26:02,381 --> 00:26:02,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

415
00:26:02,981 --> 00:26:03,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

416
00:26:03,222 --> 00:26:03,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Business is business.

417
00:26:04,423 --> 00:26:05,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray, new emailers!

418
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:28,132
[SPEAKER_04]: He's actually, though, I think on our forums, too.

419
00:26:28,152 --> 00:26:28,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

420
00:26:29,073 --> 00:26:31,154
[SPEAKER_04]: But he wants to say how much he enjoys the podcast.

421
00:26:31,194 --> 00:26:31,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

422
00:26:31,915 --> 00:26:33,356
[SPEAKER_04]: And that we do a great show.

423
00:26:33,376 --> 00:26:40,380
[SPEAKER_04]: He's wondering, since we're changing our format, if the live show will be able to be, if you can listen live through the PSP.

424
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:45,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not so sure that it's got the... It doesn't have the capability for that.

425
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:47,767
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but anything's possible.

426
00:26:47,867 --> 00:26:51,530
[SPEAKER_02]: All it would have to be able to do is... Basically, essentially how... Streaming audio.

427
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:53,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, streaming audio, how Winamp does it.

428
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you can listen... Nope.

429
00:26:55,293 --> 00:26:59,837
[SPEAKER_02]: We use Live365 to do our live stream, and you can load that in Winamp.

430
00:26:59,897 --> 00:27:03,100
[SPEAKER_02]: So if Winamp is ported to PSP, it could happen.

431
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,742
[SPEAKER_02]: But, Loki, you're saying don't count on it.

432
00:27:05,022 --> 00:27:05,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is that?

433
00:27:05,823 --> 00:27:06,163
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just...

434
00:27:06,901 --> 00:27:07,521
[SPEAKER_10]: They won't do it.

435
00:27:08,842 --> 00:27:14,104
[SPEAKER_10]: The only way that would be feasible to do that is when there's a new firmware that supports Flash.

436
00:27:14,144 --> 00:27:19,346
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you could do a Flash player for Live 365, because I know that exists.

437
00:27:19,526 --> 00:27:25,028
[SPEAKER_10]: I've tried to come up with a way to do it, but no, you're not going to be able to do it with just JavaScript.

438
00:27:25,088 --> 00:27:29,310
[SPEAKER_10]: So unfortunately, no, the only way you're going to be able to do it is the podcast for now.

439
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:29,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait and download, yep.

440
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:30,190
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

441
00:27:30,972 --> 00:27:36,296
[SPEAKER_04]: The last bit of this email is also the podcast week of 1906 to 1506.

442
00:27:37,196 --> 00:27:42,240
[SPEAKER_04]: You said they, I forgot who, is bringing a Sega Genesis game, Beggar Prince, to America.

443
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,081
[SPEAKER_04]: I honestly don't see why they are doing that.

444
00:27:44,101 --> 00:27:45,242
[SPEAKER_04]: It just seems like a waste of money.

445
00:27:45,302 --> 00:27:47,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that many people have their Genesis anymore.

446
00:27:48,944 --> 00:27:55,188
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give one of our other podcast buddies a plug here because he actually has somebody from that team who's putting out that game tonight.

447
00:27:55,228 --> 00:28:00,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out Bobby Blackwolf this week, allgames.com slash podcast because they're actually interviewing.

448
00:28:01,047 --> 00:28:02,988
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the people that is behind that game.

449
00:28:03,369 --> 00:28:07,912
[SPEAKER_02]: So check it out, and I will be, because I'm curious about that same thing.

450
00:28:08,252 --> 00:28:09,853
[SPEAKER_10]: How are they going to get 42 bucks?

451
00:28:10,173 --> 00:28:11,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Those of us who have a Nomad will be happy.

452
00:28:12,155 --> 00:28:21,541
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you don't have a Genesis, you know, if you still have a Dreamcast, there's always Under Defeat, which is another game that was actually being brought up for the Dreamcast relatively soon.

453
00:28:22,622 --> 00:28:24,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's not give up on those old systems.

454
00:28:24,423 --> 00:28:25,584
[SPEAKER_04]: They're still making 2600 games.

455
00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:26,224
[SPEAKER_04]: This is true.

456
00:28:27,165 --> 00:28:27,785
[SPEAKER_02]: This is true.

457
00:28:29,725 --> 00:28:39,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so we're going to go ahead and close up the old mailbag here, but DarkSakura, you're not quite finished with us just yet, because you have a story about Dragon Quest and the Revolution?

458
00:28:39,336 --> 00:28:40,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Woohoo!

459
00:28:40,278 --> 00:28:40,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Kinda?

460
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:41,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of?

461
00:28:41,939 --> 00:28:42,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe?

462
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, um, Hori Yuji, who was the, uh,

463
00:28:45,363 --> 00:29:04,973
[SPEAKER_04]: The project lead and the series producer for Dragon Quest VIII, he was actually at a launch event in Europe for that, actually it was in London, and said that he was very excited about the Revolutions controller and touched on more global views for selling Dragon Quest.

464
00:29:06,093 --> 00:29:06,514
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

465
00:29:06,534 --> 00:29:06,634
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

466
00:29:18,866 --> 00:29:21,348
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to sound really awful, being the gamer that I am.

467
00:29:21,608 --> 00:29:23,209
[SPEAKER_04]: I have never played a single Dragon Quest game.

468
00:29:23,749 --> 00:29:24,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

469
00:29:24,189 --> 00:29:26,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Gas, that's really interesting.

470
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,572
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, well, we all admit it.

471
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:29,713
[SPEAKER_04]: I was busy playing Guardian Legend.

472
00:29:30,093 --> 00:29:31,654
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't see Star Wars until I was in college.

473
00:29:31,894 --> 00:29:33,576
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen Star Wars except for one of them.

474
00:29:33,596 --> 00:29:33,876
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

475
00:29:33,896 --> 00:29:35,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there you go.

476
00:29:35,157 --> 00:29:35,897
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to know what's sad?

477
00:29:35,977 --> 00:29:36,577
[SPEAKER_02]: We all have our things.

478
00:29:36,617 --> 00:29:37,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Star Wars was my first movie.

479
00:29:37,838 --> 00:29:38,759
[SPEAKER_04]: I was one years old.

480
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:40,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

481
00:29:40,854 --> 00:29:44,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, okay, wait, back to, back to, back to, back to Dragon Quest.

482
00:29:45,135 --> 00:29:48,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so, DarkSakura, Miklatov, you know what game I'm talking about, yes?

483
00:29:48,956 --> 00:29:49,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes.

484
00:29:49,416 --> 00:29:50,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'll look over here then.

485
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:51,237
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Toriyama.

486
00:29:51,377 --> 00:29:52,337
[SPEAKER_02]: The game, yeah, the game.

487
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:53,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I know the art.

488
00:29:53,257 --> 00:29:54,998
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, the one where you have the sword.

489
00:29:55,018 --> 00:29:55,798
[SPEAKER_07]: With the sword.

490
00:29:55,898 --> 00:29:57,338
[SPEAKER_07]: And you go up to the TV and you go, slash.

491
00:29:57,398 --> 00:29:57,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

492
00:29:57,698 --> 00:29:58,558
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really cool looking.

493
00:29:58,618 --> 00:29:59,579
[SPEAKER_02]: So this doesn't surprise me at all.

494
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:03,440
[SPEAKER_02]: But I hope this means we'll, you know, see, you know, some Dragon Quest games on the Revolution.

495
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:03,940
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be kind of cool.

496
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Zelda with the sword.

497
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,201
[SPEAKER_04]: You just made me think about something, though.

498
00:30:07,821 --> 00:30:09,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Playing Rod Calibur.

499
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:16,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you can play Soul Calibur with the fishing rod on the Dreamcast Just thought I'd let you guys know

500
00:30:17,771 --> 00:30:20,413
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's a, just to read one of the quotes from this article.

501
00:30:20,713 --> 00:30:25,578
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, when I was making manga, I met with the technology of computer games, he told journalists.

502
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:29,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the fact that it was interactive and that you could do something and you get feedback.

503
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:33,926
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was an interactive story where you could get feedback and rewards from everything that you do.

504
00:30:33,946 --> 00:30:34,687
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be interesting.

505
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:36,728
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the idea of interactivity with the hardware.

506
00:30:37,209 --> 00:30:42,374
[SPEAKER_04]: So there, when you mention the Nintendo controller, it's a new interface and it's exciting to have that kind of reaction.

507
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:44,455
[SPEAKER_04]: You do something and it reacts to you.

508
00:30:44,595 --> 00:30:48,236
[SPEAKER_04]: It's human nature to have something feedback from your actions that's rewarding.

509
00:30:49,017 --> 00:30:49,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.

510
00:30:49,977 --> 00:30:52,758
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see what they decide to produce on the revolution.

511
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:56,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, you have some more information on what's going on with the revolution.

512
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of it rumors, some of it facts.

513
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:58,320
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on?

514
00:30:59,001 --> 00:31:02,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the stuff, I'm going to consider most of this rumor for now.

515
00:31:03,142 --> 00:31:09,505
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, first off, they had a survey that went out to a couple of gaming sites, one of them being ClassicGaming.com, I believe.

516
00:31:10,106 --> 00:31:39,772
[SPEAKER_10]: and it was talking about the virtual console that they were going to be using as kind of like their storefront for all these retro games that you're going to be able to play and download to your system and they were kind of showing some mock-ups of what the system is going to look like and they have basically where you can choose the different consoles kind of very similar to like a game tap type of thing get the rent or buy games you can do it you know buy each game individually kind of like the Xbox Live Arcade or you can you know

517
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:45,494
[SPEAKER_10]: Pay a subscription fee and actually be able to download whatever for that month.

518
00:31:47,135 --> 00:31:50,255
[SPEAKER_10]: So I thought that was pretty cool and it kind of ties into that.

519
00:31:50,896 --> 00:32:02,739
[SPEAKER_10]: They have a patent that was actually filed for their virtual console and it kind of covered a few things about how the emulator is going to work.

520
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:04,499
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, they're saying that

521
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:09,409
[SPEAKER_10]: The emulator is actually not going to be downloaded to the system.

522
00:32:10,069 --> 00:32:11,850
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not going to be on the system the entire time.

523
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:17,611
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll actually kind of download either with the games or will be on some sort of DVD type of thing.

524
00:32:18,251 --> 00:32:29,154
[SPEAKER_10]: The other thing that's talked about is you can actually, they will be able to emulate possibly the portable game systems, of course, like Game Boy and stuff, possibly DS titles.

525
00:32:29,854 --> 00:32:33,475
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, they were saying that the emulation system

526
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:39,109
[SPEAKER_10]: May be used with other consoles, not necessarily the Nintendo Revolution.

527
00:32:39,169 --> 00:32:45,033
[SPEAKER_10]: Which brings to the point, maybe they're going to license this to other people or something like that.

528
00:32:45,513 --> 00:32:46,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is quite interesting.

529
00:32:46,915 --> 00:32:54,480
[SPEAKER_10]: And also, I think we mentioned this a while back on some of the mock-ups for the Revolution where it said choose character.

530
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:59,724
[SPEAKER_10]: It covers a patent for replacing characters in legacy games.

531
00:33:00,622 --> 00:33:27,966
[SPEAKER_10]: basically being able to use your own avatar say in Super Mario Brothers so you'll be able to play it as Link or Samus or something like that which is interesting so yeah there's some rumor mill stuff the other thing though they did mention though was a list of titles that were going to be kind of launch titles for this virtual console some notable ones for the NES everybody's dying to get this Kid Icarus

532
00:33:29,296 --> 00:33:31,998
[SPEAKER_10]: and I was kind of surprised at the Super Nintendo.

533
00:33:32,018 --> 00:33:40,946
[SPEAKER_10]: They actually have some of the Super Soap 6 games, Battle Clash, the actual Super Soap 6 game and some other stuff.

534
00:33:41,606 --> 00:33:42,807
[SPEAKER_10]: Super Metroid is awesome.

535
00:33:42,847 --> 00:33:51,815
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, Nintendo 64, you've got to have Pilot Wings, Pokemon Snap, Paper Mario, and GoldenEye.

536
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.

537
00:33:53,703 --> 00:33:57,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, through the magic of radio, I actually ran out to go pee while you were talking.

538
00:33:57,385 --> 00:34:00,607
[SPEAKER_02]: So, did you get... You're listening to KTMI.

539
00:34:00,947 --> 00:34:02,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get to the DS redesign one?

540
00:34:02,588 --> 00:34:03,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm curious about that, too.

541
00:34:03,849 --> 00:34:04,309
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not yet.

542
00:34:04,329 --> 00:34:05,209
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, I want to hear this.

543
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:07,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Jumping to conclusions.

544
00:34:07,791 --> 00:34:11,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I just, you know, I'm like, okay, you know, we get it.

545
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:17,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo's going to let us download old games, and we can be all fanboyish about what games, but we still don't know shit until E3, really.

546
00:34:17,816 --> 00:34:20,217
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is all redundant to me.

547
00:34:20,277 --> 00:34:20,718
[SPEAKER_02]: No offense.

548
00:34:20,778 --> 00:34:21,738
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate you bringing the news.

549
00:34:21,758 --> 00:34:23,279
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, the whole redesign on the DS.

550
00:34:23,619 --> 00:34:25,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing official has been announced yet.

551
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:30,243
[SPEAKER_10]: That's happening tomorrow, or actually on this Monday, the 16th.

552
00:34:30,743 --> 00:34:32,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe yesterday, depending on when you're listening to this.

553
00:34:32,444 --> 00:34:33,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it depends on when you're listening to this.

554
00:34:34,485 --> 00:34:37,107
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll actually be announced on the 16th.

555
00:34:37,147 --> 00:34:39,428
[SPEAKER_10]: They're supposed to make an official announcement about the redesign.

556
00:34:39,808 --> 00:34:45,131
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the things that they're suspecting are going to be part of this announcement is... Pink.

557
00:34:45,831 --> 00:34:46,252
[SPEAKER_10]: All pink.

558
00:34:47,372 --> 00:34:50,594
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that's going to be more of a rounded, kind of a cell phone-like design.

559
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:55,515
[SPEAKER_10]: and free voice over IP calls.

560
00:34:55,615 --> 00:34:57,576
[SPEAKER_10]: It's good basically to have that built into it now.

561
00:34:58,396 --> 00:34:59,257
[SPEAKER_10]: The Nintendo gauge.

562
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:01,298
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously.

563
00:35:01,738 --> 00:35:12,645
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but the other thing, there are some mock-ups people have done with interesting ideas for it where they're saying the console will fold down to almost like a Game Boy SP type of design.

564
00:35:13,105 --> 00:35:14,986
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of like a little small case.

565
00:35:15,166 --> 00:35:16,527
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought that was a really cool design.

566
00:35:16,587 --> 00:35:19,449
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, that was all fan-done, but we'll hear more

567
00:35:20,562 --> 00:35:24,485
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll probably have more next week about this and what announcements are going to be made.

568
00:35:24,525 --> 00:35:27,867
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, we know that the system is selling like crazy in Japan.

569
00:35:28,267 --> 00:35:29,948
[SPEAKER_10]: They can't keep it on shelves.

570
00:35:30,748 --> 00:35:35,291
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I read a story this week, though, that the PSP finally outsold it for a week somewhere.

571
00:35:35,311 --> 00:35:36,272
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I read somewhere at PSP.

572
00:35:36,292 --> 00:35:37,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Only because they didn't have any.

573
00:35:37,492 --> 00:35:39,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because they were sold out.

574
00:35:40,394 --> 00:35:40,694
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways.

575
00:35:41,655 --> 00:35:43,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't try to make that system sound like it's better than the DS.

576
00:35:43,996 --> 00:35:45,217
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just saying.

577
00:35:45,317 --> 00:35:46,538
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just reporting it.

578
00:35:47,983 --> 00:35:57,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of Nintendo and DS, if you have Animal Crossing DS, hurry up and take your butt on Wi-Fi because there's actually a little special present that you can get right now.

579
00:35:57,628 --> 00:36:01,150
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you go on Wi-Fi, you can just open your gate and close it.

580
00:36:01,591 --> 00:36:07,074
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you go on Wi-Fi, you're going to get a message, a little piece of mail in your box from the president of Nintendo.

581
00:36:07,114 --> 00:36:09,095
[SPEAKER_02]: And enclosed is a Mario coin.

582
00:36:09,636 --> 00:36:10,376
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a Mario coin.

583
00:36:10,396 --> 00:36:13,538
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you tap the A button next to the Mario coin, it goes boing.

584
00:36:14,361 --> 00:36:14,781
[SPEAKER_02]: We phased out...

585
00:36:40,471 --> 00:36:41,231
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura's F.U.

586
00:36:41,251 --> 00:36:41,811
[SPEAKER_02]: of the Week

587
00:37:06,711 --> 00:37:09,074
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the part where we have to get a little bit angsty.

588
00:37:09,134 --> 00:37:11,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, chat room, usually you guys submit your FUs.

589
00:37:12,277 --> 00:37:15,520
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get to that during the special live program later on in the night.

590
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,481
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just for right now.

591
00:37:17,762 --> 00:37:20,644
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do some FUs because, damn it, we're angsty.

592
00:37:20,704 --> 00:37:21,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, DarkSakra?

593
00:37:21,765 --> 00:37:22,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

594
00:37:32,523 --> 00:37:36,105
[SPEAKER_04]: My F you tonight occurred on the way to the show.

595
00:37:36,125 --> 00:37:42,510
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to people who think that they can pull out of parking lots in front of the oncoming traffic.

596
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:49,794
[SPEAKER_04]: As in stupid, and also people who decide that they don't want to be in the lane they're in and so they're halfway in that lane and the other.

597
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:52,536
[SPEAKER_04]: I experienced the two together today.

598
00:37:53,717 --> 00:37:58,520
[SPEAKER_04]: One stupid person in this old beat up looking Cadillac was halfway in

599
00:37:59,295 --> 00:38:07,216
[SPEAKER_04]: the turning lane that I needed to be in and halfway in the going forward lane and then this car decides that he's going to turn in a completely black VW lane and I'm like, uh-uh.

600
00:38:08,377 --> 00:38:10,877
[SPEAKER_04]: I nosed my way up in the Silver Lancer of Love.

601
00:38:11,177 --> 00:38:16,258
[SPEAKER_02]: If this were burnout, this guy would be dead meat.

602
00:38:17,018 --> 00:38:21,559
[SPEAKER_04]: I've nosed up, I pointed at the man and said, you back up.

603
00:38:21,779 --> 00:38:24,820
[SPEAKER_04]: And he just gave me this look of utter surprise and did it.

604
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,180
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, that's right, you bow down.

605
00:38:26,835 --> 00:38:33,858
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, my car, being the most nimble and beautiful vehicle in existence, managed to navigate around the evil Cadillac.

606
00:38:34,618 --> 00:38:38,160
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not know how I did it, because I had almost no clearance, but I made it.

607
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,361
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am here, and I was here early.

608
00:38:41,181 --> 00:38:43,642
[SPEAKER_04]: So, F you to the morons on the road.

609
00:38:44,623 --> 00:38:45,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Loki, your F you of the week.

610
00:38:47,164 --> 00:38:56,228
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, basically, my only F you is gonna be that, you know, I have to wait some time to actually get full auto...

611
00:38:57,776 --> 00:38:58,396
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to know.

612
00:38:59,197 --> 00:39:02,018
[SPEAKER_02]: My FU is to the lack of Xbox 360s.

613
00:39:02,118 --> 00:39:04,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn you, Microsoft, for not putting enough out there.

614
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:07,520
[SPEAKER_02]: And damn you, eBayers, for fucking it all up.

615
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Nico Todd, do you have an FU?

616
00:39:09,261 --> 00:39:09,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

617
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:13,402
[SPEAKER_07]: FU to not having tomorrow off like everybody else in the world.

618
00:39:13,963 --> 00:39:15,283
[SPEAKER_04]: I work for a bank, so I get off.

619
00:39:15,723 --> 00:39:16,004
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

620
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:18,885
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

621
00:39:20,565 --> 00:39:21,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, that was PC.

622
00:39:25,123 --> 00:39:27,444
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so that was our FUs of the week.

623
00:39:27,624 --> 00:39:29,244
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to do something that I've promised.

624
00:39:29,445 --> 00:39:29,805
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

625
00:39:30,485 --> 00:39:32,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello to Mistress Tia in the chat room.

626
00:39:35,046 --> 00:39:35,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

627
00:39:36,027 --> 00:39:38,528
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, don't forget, we tape our podcast live now, everybody.

628
00:39:38,548 --> 00:39:40,868
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going like, what the F are these people on?

629
00:39:41,889 --> 00:39:42,709
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, moving on.

630
00:39:42,749 --> 00:39:44,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get to our next article tonight.

631
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:47,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what's going on with the game Gun?

632
00:39:47,511 --> 00:39:48,731
[SPEAKER_02]: When's the sequel coming out?

633
00:39:49,752 --> 00:39:53,233
[SPEAKER_10]: The sequel's coming out probably either close to never.

634
00:39:54,972 --> 00:40:00,535
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Gun and True Crime unfortunately weren't the breakout hits that they had hoped they would be.

635
00:40:01,876 --> 00:40:06,499
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's rumored now that they've actually been cancelled due to low sales of both games.

636
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,102
[SPEAKER_10]: And actually I can kind of back this up distribution wise.

637
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:19,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody that's direct with Activision right now is actually getting a nice price break on the Gun and True Crime New York City.

638
00:40:19,407 --> 00:40:22,208
[SPEAKER_10]: They're selling them for about $10 a pop.

639
00:40:22,969 --> 00:40:23,950
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course you have to buy like 4,000 units but

640
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:29,672
[SPEAKER_10]: The point is that the game's not selling what it's supposed to be.

641
00:40:29,992 --> 00:40:35,874
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought they were really good games, but apparently I was wrong.

642
00:40:36,814 --> 00:40:40,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, what's going on with Ragnarok Online?

643
00:40:40,375 --> 00:40:43,637
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a follow-up to something we talked about last week on the show, right?

644
00:40:45,017 --> 00:40:46,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

645
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,118
[SPEAKER_02]: You're pouting over there.

646
00:40:48,178 --> 00:40:48,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

647
00:40:49,259 --> 00:40:50,159
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki has to say.

648
00:40:50,937 --> 00:40:51,498
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, Loki?

649
00:40:51,718 --> 00:40:55,361
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there was a rumor that Ragnarok Online was coming to the DS.

650
00:40:55,422 --> 00:40:58,384
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, it ended up being another funny Photoshop.

651
00:40:59,005 --> 00:41:04,290
[SPEAKER_02]: So somebody actually Photoshopped from Famitsu Magazine some article to make it look like Ragnarok was actually coming on the DS.

652
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it was someone that listens to the show that got the idea?

653
00:41:07,153 --> 00:41:07,373
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

654
00:41:08,073 --> 00:41:08,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

655
00:41:08,534 --> 00:41:08,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

656
00:41:08,814 --> 00:41:09,215
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know.

657
00:41:09,535 --> 00:41:09,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Doubt it.

658
00:41:10,155 --> 00:41:11,297
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have listeners in Japan.

659
00:41:11,577 --> 00:41:12,017
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

660
00:41:12,438 --> 00:41:12,678
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true.

661
00:41:12,718 --> 00:41:13,078
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know.

662
00:41:13,959 --> 00:41:14,239
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

663
00:41:15,936 --> 00:41:17,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Guitar Freaks Guitar Hero Guitar Freaks

664
00:41:36,502 --> 00:41:38,464
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the major importers.

665
00:41:39,005 --> 00:41:45,814
[SPEAKER_04]: There is news that there is a super deluxe Japanese arcade style controller for Guitar Freaks coming out.

666
00:41:46,836 --> 00:41:46,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

667
00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:53,489
[SPEAKER_04]: To go ahead and read this quote, I'm just going to read directly from here.

668
00:41:53,529 --> 00:41:58,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Last night, Konami gave the green light for the production of the ASC guitar for use with Guitar Freaks games.

669
00:41:58,333 --> 00:42:08,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Although the final specs of the guitar are not available for perusal yet, the company's website specifies that it will be modeled closely after the guitar used at the Coinop GF machines.

670
00:42:09,002 --> 00:42:12,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you can't use a Guitar Freaks controller, though, on a Guitar Hero game.

671
00:42:12,987 --> 00:42:13,648
[SPEAKER_02]: That's important to know.

672
00:42:13,668 --> 00:42:14,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, yes, you can.

673
00:42:14,469 --> 00:42:14,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you?

674
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:16,232
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I read an article that said you couldn't.

675
00:42:16,392 --> 00:42:16,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you can.

676
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:17,213
[SPEAKER_04]: How?

677
00:42:17,914 --> 00:42:18,515
[SPEAKER_04]: You plug it in.

678
00:42:19,216 --> 00:42:21,358
[SPEAKER_02]: But what about the... Can you only play the three?

679
00:42:21,378 --> 00:42:23,381
[SPEAKER_04]: You can only play an easy, but you can use it.

680
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:23,982
[SPEAKER_04]: It will work.

681
00:42:24,282 --> 00:42:24,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Weird.

682
00:42:24,623 --> 00:42:25,424
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that you couldn't do it.

683
00:42:25,444 --> 00:42:26,205
[SPEAKER_04]: You just can't will hard.

684
00:42:27,116 --> 00:42:28,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Digg.com

685
00:42:49,966 --> 00:42:53,848
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a good way for you to, you know, cut loose, so to speak.

686
00:42:54,348 --> 00:42:58,370
[SPEAKER_04]: You remind me of one of the more embarrassing moments in my relationship with my husband.

687
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:59,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, then you must share.

688
00:42:59,291 --> 00:42:59,951
[SPEAKER_02]: You must share.

689
00:43:01,492 --> 00:43:08,175
[SPEAKER_04]: I go into the living room one day at one of our older apartments, and Dan, I was playing pata pata, and I went off, like, to go to the bathroom or something.

690
00:43:08,195 --> 00:43:12,857
[SPEAKER_04]: I come back in, and Dan's got the guitar freaks controller doing air guitar freaks to pata pata.

691
00:43:14,878 --> 00:43:17,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it was frightening.

692
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:18,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

693
00:43:18,968 --> 00:43:19,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

694
00:43:19,268 --> 00:43:20,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Air Guitar Freaks.

695
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:22,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Creative.

696
00:43:23,331 --> 00:43:26,614
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to patent that idea and sell it to Konami.

697
00:43:28,415 --> 00:43:28,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Air Guitar Freaks.

698
00:43:29,016 --> 00:43:29,576
[SPEAKER_07]: You can try.

699
00:43:30,677 --> 00:43:31,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Using the eye toy.

700
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:34,140
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see what happens.

701
00:43:34,673 --> 00:43:34,753
[SPEAKER_02]: E.A.

702
00:43:34,773 --> 00:43:36,834
[SPEAKER_02]: is bringing Lord of the Rings Battle for Middle-Earth 2.

703
00:43:55,672 --> 00:43:57,992
[SPEAKER_04]: to Xbox 360 in the summertime.

704
00:43:58,573 --> 00:44:02,353
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a real-time strategy game based on the PC version that's due out on March 3rd.

705
00:44:02,493 --> 00:44:03,093
[SPEAKER_04]: That's in the UK.

706
00:44:03,693 --> 00:44:07,674
[SPEAKER_04]: And it will be the first Lord of the Rings game to work on Xbox Live.

707
00:44:07,694 --> 00:44:14,315
[SPEAKER_04]: They're saying it will have a new and intuitive console-specific control scheme.

708
00:44:15,816 --> 00:44:17,096
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like the quote in here.

709
00:44:17,116 --> 00:44:18,636
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, A promise is a promise, EA.

710
00:44:18,696 --> 00:44:19,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember that.

711
00:44:21,217 --> 00:44:22,637
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought that was very interesting.

712
00:44:22,657 --> 00:44:23,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Them spiting words.

713
00:44:23,477 --> 00:44:23,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

714
00:44:24,739 --> 00:44:52,837
[SPEAKER_04]: also another one that I am personally very excited about is Sonic Riders because one of my favorite games of all time is Sonic R that's a great game, that's an amazing game right there and I actually have Sonic R for the PC which I still play because it's hard to go back and play it on the Saturn because the graphics are just so much better on the PC one and I do have it on Saturn as well but Sonic Riders just looks like it's Sonic R done right, you know what I mean?

715
00:44:53,477 --> 00:44:56,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything that was wrong in Sonic R, Sonic Riders is doing better.

716
00:44:56,819 --> 00:45:03,342
[SPEAKER_04]: They all have these hoverboard things and basically shoot through levels that look like they're ripped right out of Sonic Adventure.

717
00:45:03,362 --> 00:45:03,962
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty cool.

718
00:45:04,563 --> 00:45:08,104
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as Super Sonic Racing is in that song, I'll be happy.

719
00:45:10,386 --> 00:45:11,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Sega loves us.

720
00:45:11,146 --> 00:45:12,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

721
00:45:12,066 --> 00:45:14,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's the free games then?

722
00:45:16,064 --> 00:45:16,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey!

723
00:45:16,985 --> 00:45:18,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is Phantasy Star delayed?

724
00:45:19,147 --> 00:45:19,748
[SPEAKER_04]: I know!

725
00:45:20,709 --> 00:45:21,489
[SPEAKER_10]: I get the free games.

726
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:22,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

727
00:45:28,357 --> 00:45:31,400
[SPEAKER_04]: There's actually also another thing in here too that I thought was kind of neat.

728
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:34,123
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually makes me think of Arctic Thunder.

729
00:45:35,226 --> 00:45:35,546
[SPEAKER_04]: It's tricky!

730
00:45:35,586 --> 00:45:37,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Game on, it's tricky!

731
00:45:59,113 --> 00:46:00,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad joke, if you've ever played SSX.

732
00:46:00,854 --> 00:46:05,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Four of the tracks listed are Metal City, Splash Canyon, Egg Factory, and Sand Ruins.

733
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:06,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's Casino Zone?

734
00:46:06,896 --> 00:46:08,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Because every Sonic game's got to have a casino zone.

735
00:46:08,837 --> 00:46:09,417
[SPEAKER_04]: You need Casino Night, okay?

736
00:46:09,437 --> 00:46:12,158
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always a casino or pinball zone or something.

737
00:46:12,258 --> 00:46:14,279
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what the music I would love to hear in this?

738
00:46:14,299 --> 00:46:14,519
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

739
00:46:14,539 --> 00:46:17,280
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to hear a remix of the Ice Cap music from Sonic 3.

740
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,641
[SPEAKER_04]: The little disco-y dance-y one.

741
00:46:19,661 --> 00:46:20,541
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was pretty cool.

742
00:46:21,101 --> 00:46:22,562
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like trance and 16-bit.

743
00:46:23,707 --> 00:46:30,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, one other game coming out, Sengoku Basara sequel coming out for PS2, put out by Capcom.

744
00:46:31,811 --> 00:46:45,078
[SPEAKER_04]: And the original development team is returning for that, including Kobayashi Hiroyuki, who is behind Resident Evil 4, and Yamamoto Makoto, who is Piano 3, which that game wasn't all that great, but still.

745
00:46:45,158 --> 00:46:47,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm going to admit, I've never even heard of Sengoku Basara 1.

746
00:46:48,059 --> 00:46:48,940
[SPEAKER_02]: What are these games?

747
00:46:50,501 --> 00:46:53,062
[SPEAKER_04]: It's... This one's actually...

748
00:46:53,684 --> 00:46:58,690
[SPEAKER_04]: They... I'm trying... It's a historical beat-em-up type game.

749
00:46:59,311 --> 00:46:59,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

750
00:46:59,891 --> 00:47:01,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a Dynasty Warriors or something?

751
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

752
00:47:02,054 --> 00:47:06,599
[SPEAKER_04]: But this one... And I just know, because I know several people who are into the series, so I thought I would mention it.

753
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:14,048
[SPEAKER_04]: But this one, they actually have an art of one of the new characters, who is Maeda Keiji, who is...

754
00:47:14,844 --> 00:47:16,444
[SPEAKER_04]: They say a historical warrior.

755
00:47:16,564 --> 00:47:24,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I have a year on here, 1543 to 1612, who lived during the reign of Toyotomi Hideyoshi in the Sengoku period.

756
00:47:24,986 --> 00:47:27,647
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was pretty cool.

757
00:47:27,667 --> 00:47:27,927
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

758
00:47:28,607 --> 00:47:29,887
[SPEAKER_02]: And then something about a contest?

759
00:47:30,127 --> 00:47:33,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, a contest for folks in the UK.

760
00:47:34,368 --> 00:47:35,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I enter?

761
00:47:36,268 --> 00:47:36,408
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

762
00:47:36,648 --> 00:47:37,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is a sucky contest.

763
00:47:38,529 --> 00:47:39,069
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not fair.

764
00:47:40,339 --> 00:47:44,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you like to win a DS and Prince of Persia?

765
00:47:59,318 --> 00:48:04,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, with this particular contest, you can, again, win Battles of Prince of Persia and a DS.

766
00:48:05,142 --> 00:48:09,024
[SPEAKER_04]: The entry is on Yahoo UK Games.

767
00:48:09,864 --> 00:48:11,065
[SPEAKER_04]: So just give a clue.

768
00:48:11,125 --> 00:48:19,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I'll go ahead and... The URL is very long, so just go to Yahoo UK and Ireland Games and give it a hunt.

769
00:48:20,051 --> 00:48:26,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you win, and you heard about it from us, you're going to have to cut your DS in half and send half to us, because that's our commission.

770
00:48:26,855 --> 00:48:28,916
[SPEAKER_02]: So we get one screen of your DS if you win.

771
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:30,480
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

772
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Blood Rain was set to open in 1,900 theaters.

773
00:49:19,488 --> 00:49:25,352
[SPEAKER_10]: It ended up showing less than 1,000 screens and, like I said, made barely a million dollars.

774
00:49:25,793 --> 00:49:29,996
[SPEAKER_10]: In addition, hundreds of theaters reported receiving prints of the film that they didn't order.

775
00:49:30,336 --> 00:49:32,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Needless to say, they refused to screen them.

776
00:49:33,658 --> 00:49:34,699
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a wonderful tactic.

777
00:49:34,759 --> 00:49:40,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Send the prints to the theaters that won't carry it so that they might accidentally put it on screen.

778
00:49:41,163 --> 00:49:43,365
[SPEAKER_10]: In other news, Uybol is a giant douche.

779
00:49:44,246 --> 00:49:47,468
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, he hates everything that has to do... Don't hold back now.

780
00:49:48,137 --> 00:49:52,219
[SPEAKER_10]: He hates everything that has to do with Hollywood, calling them as greedy thieves.

781
00:49:52,339 --> 00:49:56,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Those greedy thieves are paying to finance your movies, ironically enough.

782
00:49:57,302 --> 00:50:09,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, during the premiere for BloodRayne, actors were brought on stage so Evil can make a little speech, but forced them not to speak because he hates when actors talk.

783
00:50:10,109 --> 00:50:14,971
[SPEAKER_04]: And finally, I don't know, he's just... He's really in the right business.

784
00:50:15,211 --> 00:50:16,632
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, he's just

785
00:50:17,375 --> 00:50:21,303
[SPEAKER_10]: I read that on the internet so it must be true.

786
00:50:29,332 --> 00:50:30,233
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

787
00:50:51,273 --> 00:50:51,933
[SPEAKER_07]: and you know what?

788
00:50:51,953 --> 00:50:54,094
[SPEAKER_07]: We're getting Silent Hill and that looks amazing.

789
00:50:54,114 --> 00:50:54,774
[SPEAKER_07]: April 21st.

790
00:50:54,834 --> 00:50:55,494
[SPEAKER_07]: April 21st.

791
00:50:55,514 --> 00:50:58,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Pyramid Head's going to be up in thinking half.

792
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:01,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Two days after my birthday so whoever wants to buy me a ticket to see it.

793
00:51:02,555 --> 00:51:03,636
[SPEAKER_07]: See, we're going to get a good movie.

794
00:51:03,836 --> 00:51:06,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not get a bad movie in the form of Metal Gear Solid?

795
00:51:06,176 --> 00:51:06,956
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it would be great.

796
00:51:06,996 --> 00:51:07,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's solid.

797
00:51:08,077 --> 00:51:09,917
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

798
00:51:10,177 --> 00:51:10,797
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what we need?

799
00:51:11,397 --> 00:51:19,339
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to have Snake done by someone really hot but voiced over by David Hayter and have David Hayter write the script.

800
00:51:20,174 --> 00:51:22,136
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, you were telling me a little bit about this before the show.

801
00:51:22,156 --> 00:51:22,656
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on here?

802
00:51:22,676 --> 00:51:24,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there are some very...

803
00:51:46,608 --> 00:51:51,912
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a bit of a speculative article about for the game year in review for 2010.

804
00:51:51,992 --> 00:51:55,855
[SPEAKER_04]: This made me... In the year 2010.

805
00:51:55,895 --> 00:52:00,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thank you.

806
00:52:00,738 --> 00:52:02,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Never mind, you don't watch TV, so you don't get it.

807
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:03,280
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Conan O'Brien.

808
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,561
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't watch TV.

809
00:52:04,581 --> 00:52:05,742
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a life.

810
00:52:05,802 --> 00:52:07,003
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the show to watch.

811
00:52:07,243 --> 00:52:08,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Every college kid loves.

812
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:10,505
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we're older than college kids.

813
00:52:10,645 --> 00:52:12,286
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm a college kid.

814
00:52:12,306 --> 00:52:13,107
[SPEAKER_02]: At heart, we're college kids.

815
00:52:13,127 --> 00:52:14,108
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm busy doing?

816
00:52:14,528 --> 00:52:14,848
[SPEAKER_02]: College?

817
00:52:15,349 --> 00:52:15,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Playing Animal Crossing.

818
00:52:17,248 --> 00:52:22,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I'm taking Flash Animation, what are you talking about?

819
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:32,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the speculation is Sony's attempt to hang on to its thin lead in the gaming industry by only selling the PlayStation 4 to 6 carefully chosen celebrities.

820
00:52:32,779 --> 00:52:34,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Seems like it might backfire.

821
00:52:35,661 --> 00:52:39,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Children's crayon drawings of the PS4 going for over $400 on eBay.

822
00:52:39,963 --> 00:52:43,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Please tell me, for the love of God, Paris Hilton will not still be a celebrity in 2010.

823
00:52:43,925 --> 00:52:48,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Paris Hilton is reported to have held the new console briefly at arm's length before throwing it in the closet.

824
00:52:48,467 --> 00:52:49,208
[SPEAKER_04]: God damn it.

825
00:52:52,069 --> 00:52:53,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Who made these predictions, Ms.

826
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:53,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Cleo?

827
00:52:54,331 --> 00:52:56,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo creates the Nintendo apocalypse.

828
00:52:57,893 --> 00:53:01,255
[SPEAKER_04]: that will like any type of game controller whatsoever.

829
00:53:01,415 --> 00:53:03,336
[SPEAKER_04]: How about the Nintendo Fuck Your Shit Up?

830
00:53:03,636 --> 00:53:09,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead, you will direct the on-screen action by grabbing a household pet by the front legs and making it do a little dance.

831
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:13,701
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the exciting wheelbarrow controller.

832
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:18,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Featuring WarioWare Yardwork mode.

833
00:53:18,183 --> 00:53:18,784
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be great.

834
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:22,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo Faithful pointed out this is still better than a gamepad for first-person shooters.

835
00:53:24,036 --> 00:53:31,698
[SPEAKER_04]: On the handheld front, Sony and Nintendo continue their fight for the minds and backpacks of the nation's gamers by releasing ever-larger portable consoles.

836
00:53:32,058 --> 00:53:36,560
[SPEAKER_04]: The Nintendo XL with six screens, a folding seat, and selection of overpriced candy bars.

837
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:44,122
[SPEAKER_04]: While the PlayStation's still ostensibly portal, can now play all forms of media, including two-ton cuneiform tablets.

838
00:53:44,302 --> 00:53:45,202
[SPEAKER_02]: This is absurd.

839
00:53:45,362 --> 00:53:45,782
[SPEAKER_02]: This is absurd.

840
00:53:45,802 --> 00:53:47,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Where can people read this?

841
00:53:47,263 --> 00:53:48,323
[SPEAKER_04]: This is unwired.

842
00:53:48,883 --> 00:53:49,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Wired.com.

843
00:53:50,263 --> 00:53:55,025
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll post the link in the chat room for those listeners privileged to hang out there.

844
00:53:56,605 --> 00:54:03,888
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting towards the end of the show here, believe it or not, but what a good way to go out than to talk about sex.

845
00:54:04,868 --> 00:54:07,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about sex, baby.

846
00:54:07,409 --> 00:54:09,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about sex on the Xbox 360.

847
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:12,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Not literally sex on your Xbox 360, but Loki.

848
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:12,871
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably could.

849
00:54:12,911 --> 00:54:13,671
[SPEAKER_02]: It's big enough.

850
00:54:14,431 --> 00:54:17,052
[SPEAKER_02]: On that power supply, you might be able to do something raunchy with that.

851
00:54:17,603 --> 00:54:18,904
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, kids, cover your ears.

852
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:20,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Rez controller time.

853
00:54:20,645 --> 00:54:21,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

854
00:54:21,766 --> 00:54:23,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try to keep it clean, Loki.

855
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:26,149
[SPEAKER_02]: What's this with HD porn coming into 360?

856
00:54:26,189 --> 00:54:28,110
[SPEAKER_02]: This has to be a load of crap, right?

857
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:32,593
[SPEAKER_10]: No, actually, the first movie that they're bringing over, there's a couple companies there behind it.

858
00:54:32,653 --> 00:54:40,658
[SPEAKER_10]: The first one being Arrow Productions, which is bringing the HD version of Deep Throat, very classic adult film, to the Xbox 360.

859
00:54:41,059 --> 00:54:42,920
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not quite sure...

860
00:54:43,955 --> 00:54:48,799
[SPEAKER_10]: How they're going to do this, or what format it's going to be in, I don't know.

861
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:57,025
[SPEAKER_10]: My guess is probably WMV HD format, so Windows Media.

862
00:54:57,586 --> 00:54:59,647
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, so look forward to that.

863
00:54:59,707 --> 00:55:01,829
[SPEAKER_10]: There's actually going to be some more info about it.

864
00:55:02,749 --> 00:55:07,173
[SPEAKER_10]: DeepthroatHD.com is where you'll want to watch for the news on that.

865
00:55:07,253 --> 00:55:08,674
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we know this isn't a load of crap?

866
00:55:09,477 --> 00:55:11,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because the website's registered, I don't know.

867
00:55:12,238 --> 00:55:14,339
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm taking this with a huge grain of salt here.

868
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:21,263
[SPEAKER_10]: How could they possibly... This is actually from the adult video conference.

869
00:55:21,743 --> 00:55:26,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, they had a DVD version and this HD version playing side by side.

870
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:36,990
[SPEAKER_10]: But see, the whole thing that makes me real skeptical about this, and this is where I'm going into for Next Company, which is actually... Let's see here.

871
00:55:38,561 --> 00:55:39,041
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

872
00:56:08,491 --> 00:56:09,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there ever?

873
00:56:10,732 --> 00:56:11,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know me.

874
00:56:11,712 --> 00:56:13,092
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm such a little horn dog.

875
00:56:13,132 --> 00:56:15,373
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to find about Sex and Video Games Conference.

876
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:29,076
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a conference going on in San Francisco June 8th to 9th at the Knob Hill Masonic Center that is the Sex and Video Games Conference exploring the business of digital erotic entertainment.

877
00:56:30,456 --> 00:56:35,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Panels include Creating Mainstream Erotic Games, Integrating International Success to the U.S.

878
00:56:36,038 --> 00:56:36,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Market,

879
00:56:37,145 --> 00:56:51,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Emergent Sex and Video Games and Video Game Hardware, Creating Successful Online Erotic Games, Investing in Sexually Themed Games, Alternative Distribution Methods for AO Games, and MMOEG Panel.

880
00:56:52,894 --> 00:56:54,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Massively Multiplayer Online Erotic Game?

881
00:56:55,835 --> 00:56:57,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that orgy the game?

882
00:56:58,717 --> 00:56:59,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Orgy for PC.

883
00:57:01,518 --> 00:57:06,041
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, I think you need to do some field work and attend this conference and bring back a full report.

884
00:57:07,093 --> 00:57:07,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to pay for it?

885
00:57:08,374 --> 00:57:08,534
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

886
00:57:08,574 --> 00:57:09,374
[SPEAKER_02]: How much is it to go?

887
00:57:09,394 --> 00:57:09,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we know?

888
00:57:09,835 --> 00:57:10,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably too much.

889
00:57:11,035 --> 00:57:13,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you can save over 40% of the registration fee by signing in for it by May 7, 2006.

890
00:57:13,157 --> 00:57:13,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Early bird price is $295.

891
00:57:13,637 --> 00:57:13,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Through June 6, $395.

892
00:57:14,077 --> 00:57:14,257
[SPEAKER_04]: On-site, $495.

893
00:57:14,297 --> 00:57:15,738
[SPEAKER_04]: They better have naked chicks there.

894
00:57:15,758 --> 00:57:17,139
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what that would be, though?

895
00:57:17,719 --> 00:57:17,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

896
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:19,100
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be half the price of my new iMac.

897
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:19,280
[SPEAKER_04]: So, no.

898
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:19,820
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

899
00:57:37,617 --> 00:57:39,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Last thing for the night, and then we're going to call it a show.

900
00:57:42,099 --> 00:57:44,180
[SPEAKER_02]: This whole sex in video games thing makes me think.

901
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:48,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Are video games sexy enough or too sexy?

902
00:57:48,221 --> 00:57:52,783
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're going to say not sexy enough, what could they do to make games more sexy?

903
00:57:53,063 --> 00:57:53,583
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.

904
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:55,724
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I think that I'm actually too sexy for the games.

905
00:57:56,485 --> 00:57:57,225
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

906
00:57:57,445 --> 00:57:58,505
[SPEAKER_02]: You misinterpreted my question.

907
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:02,247
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

908
00:58:02,327 --> 00:58:02,667
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

909
00:58:03,416 --> 00:58:09,017
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go back, because the old standby, our motto, applies to this.

910
00:58:10,758 --> 00:58:11,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Gameplay!

911
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:14,558
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the gameplay that makes a game good.

912
00:58:14,598 --> 00:58:31,822
[SPEAKER_04]: It does not have to have hot, naked people in it, and, you know, pantsless rage, and... It doesn't need to have all of... You know, I think it's fine to make it attractive, and I think that if the, you know... I do have to say that the average...

913
00:58:32,919 --> 00:58:33,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Lokey?

914
00:59:00,962 --> 00:59:07,932
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say it's a complete waste of the whole next-gen of gaming.

915
00:59:08,973 --> 00:59:10,554
[SPEAKER_10]: We do not have HD titties in there.

916
00:59:10,694 --> 00:59:14,517
[SPEAKER_10]: Because goddammit, we need HD titties to be on this next-gen console.

917
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:16,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Where are my adult-only games?

918
00:59:16,579 --> 00:59:23,184
[SPEAKER_10]: If they have a goddamn adult-only rating system, I want adult games to be on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.

919
00:59:24,125 --> 00:59:25,566
[SPEAKER_10]: I want my nudity.

920
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:27,787
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want my extreme violence as well.

921
00:59:27,887 --> 00:59:30,609
[SPEAKER_10]: I want things that will make Jack Thompson go crazy.

922
00:59:31,090 --> 00:59:37,335
[SPEAKER_10]: And in fact, I want the next Grand Theft Auto to be so outrageous and bad that it's banned from half the world.

923
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Only I get to play.

924
00:59:39,381 --> 00:59:42,262
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I want to see because I think that's what we need.

925
00:59:42,402 --> 00:59:42,902
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know what?

926
00:59:43,142 --> 00:59:44,683
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree with you about the gameplay.

927
00:59:45,163 --> 00:59:46,444
[SPEAKER_10]: That's where the revolution comes in.

928
00:59:46,504 --> 00:59:50,386
[SPEAKER_10]: And damn it, Nintendo didn't get to jump on this bandwagon with, you know, sex games.

929
00:59:50,706 --> 00:59:52,286
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't wait to see Playboy the Mansion 2.

930
00:59:52,667 --> 00:59:53,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the revolution?

931
00:59:53,627 --> 00:59:54,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Full frontal nudity?

932
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:55,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Res 2.

933
00:59:56,588 --> 00:59:58,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, comments from our chat room.

934
00:59:58,849 --> 00:59:59,510
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some folks.

935
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:02,211
[SPEAKER_02]: More naked males, of course, you know.

936
01:00:02,651 --> 01:00:05,232
[SPEAKER_02]: The women and gay men, you know, need some cock.

937
01:00:05,252 --> 01:00:06,713
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as the asexuals, though.

938
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:07,013
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

939
01:00:07,856 --> 01:00:08,456
[SPEAKER_04]: They have Tetris.

940
01:00:10,318 --> 01:00:10,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

941
01:00:11,619 --> 01:00:16,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Some various comments here from Fireboma and GS191.

942
01:00:17,263 --> 01:00:17,983
[SPEAKER_02]: More Cowbell.

943
01:00:19,464 --> 01:00:20,865
[SPEAKER_04]: We do need more Cowbell.

944
01:00:22,266 --> 01:00:22,626
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

945
01:00:22,727 --> 01:00:27,770
[SPEAKER_02]: On that note, I think it's about time we wrap things up here on Orange Lounge Radio.

946
01:00:28,311 --> 01:00:29,972
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a great first show, though.

947
01:00:30,032 --> 01:00:32,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys for tuning in and listening or downloading it.

948
01:00:32,273 --> 01:00:33,274
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a little different.

949
01:00:33,314 --> 01:00:36,216
[SPEAKER_02]: I think some of our folks who listened to previous podcasts might be shocked.

950
01:00:36,336 --> 01:00:36,656
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's 170.

951
01:00:37,782 --> 01:00:38,583
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

952
01:00:56,092 --> 01:00:59,314
[SPEAKER_04]: No Grand Theft DDR evil chatroom.

953
01:00:59,734 --> 01:01:00,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop paying attention to the chatroom.

954
01:01:00,795 --> 01:01:01,235
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll go away.

955
01:01:02,516 --> 01:01:04,297
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

956
01:01:04,337 --> 01:01:08,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Miklatov, I know you didn't talk a whole lot tonight, but thank you for being here and being moral support.

957
01:01:08,459 --> 01:01:09,000
[SPEAKER_07]: You're welcome.

958
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:12,442
[SPEAKER_02]: And anything you want for games to be sexier?

959
01:01:13,662 --> 01:01:15,183
[SPEAKER_07]: No, because I think that's kind of stupid.

960
01:01:16,124 --> 01:01:17,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Except if it's hot guys.

961
01:01:17,385 --> 01:01:18,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than that, it's stupid.

962
01:01:18,625 --> 01:01:19,366
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's your final thought?

963
01:01:19,606 --> 01:01:22,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I want to play some more World of Warcraft right now.

964
01:01:23,168 --> 01:01:23,468
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

965
01:01:24,089 --> 01:01:24,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, your final thought.

966
01:01:25,533 --> 01:01:27,934
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to check out DOA 4 this week.

967
01:01:28,554 --> 01:01:33,016
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is I want an Xbox 360 at the store.

968
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:35,577
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, your final thought?

969
01:01:36,778 --> 01:01:37,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Reject false icons.

970
01:01:38,498 --> 01:01:39,419
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, that's going to do it.

971
01:01:39,459 --> 01:01:42,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much for tuning in and listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

972
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,060
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you next week.

973
01:01:45,521 --> 01:01:48,903
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

974
01:01:49,223 --> 01:01:51,864
