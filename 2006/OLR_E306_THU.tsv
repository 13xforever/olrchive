14245	19512	We are live here at the E3 Outpost for this special Thursday E3 2006 edition.
32130	39912	Welcome everybody to the Thursday edition of Orange Lounge Radio, live from the E3 Outpost, celebrating all things that is E3 2006.
40832	42652	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.
42712	49074	Joining me as always, say hello to my exhausted yet perky co-host, DarkSakura, also known as Jamie Summers.
49094	49594	Hi.
49834	50594	How you doing?
51094	52974	I slept on the thingy.
53135	53635	On the bus?
53815	55115	I hate LA traffic.
56264	57685	It took long enough that I could sleep.
57966	58886	I took a proper nap.
59006	59587	Well, whatever.
60307	62809	Also, say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
63070	63370	Hello.
63630	64030	How you doing?
64751	65171	I'm good.
65271	68934	I just ate a bunch of popcorn, chicken, and bacon out of these potato skins.
69054	71016	Loving the catering at the E3 Outpost.
71156	73258	And then I took the bacon and dipped it in barbecue sauce.
73338	74138	Good people.
75319	75559	What?
76200	77181	That's what I can do.
77681	79242	Prove super bacon to the next level.
79282	79582	All right.
80423	80904	Next time.
80964	81264	All right.
81624	82245	Also, say hello.
82265	84927	Joining us again tonight, our good pal, Bobby Blackwolf.
85507	85767	Yo.
86068	86728	How you doing, Bobby?
87349	88850	Tired, my feet hurt.
89691	91493	I am all weed out.
91513	94195	That's probably how everybody feels about you after eating three today.
94476	99340	Also, wave hello to Mr. Lawrence Young, who is producing us tonight.
99380	101182	He doesn't have a mic, so he can't say hi back.
101222	102023	But this is what he would say.
102383	102904	That's me.
102984	103644	That's me.
104605	111149	Alright, first of all, for those of you guys listening live tonight, it's about, what, 7.50 and we were supposed to be on at 6.30?
111549	114270	I apologize, especially to those of you guys on the East Coast.
114851	115691	Crap happens.
116651	119433	We were actually at a booth right up until 5.45.
119973	126337	We had an appointment at a booth, and so we actually missed the first shuttle back here to the outpost, so we had to wait for the second one.
126377	127297	So I apologize.
127857	128418	It happens.
129158	130219	Technical difficulties.
130299	130579	Anyway...
130939	133101	Let's talk about E3 and some of the stuff we saw today.
133141	135543	We're going to play three interesting things.
135743	139005	DarkSakura, what's one of them?
139206	147632	I went to the Kings of Korea, or whatever they called it, and apparently one of the companies is bringing out a new Kunio game.
150014	156879	They said 2007, but they're basically giving rebirth to the Kunio franchise, which I thought was pretty cool.
157100	159802	And he seemed absolutely surprised that I would... Is that a Kunio game? !
160442	163404	For those who don't know what that is, was that a popular anime?
163484	165465	It was brought over as River City Ransom.
166045	167026	Oh shit!
167226	167986	And Dodgeball.
168006	169027	That's all I needed to hear.
169447	176411	But overseas it was Hot Blooded Downtown Story and Kunio's Dodgeball.
176431	177691	What's this new game they're doing?
178432	180553	I didn't really tell much about it because I don't read Korean.
182165	183165	But it's Kunio game.
183265	183845	What did it look like?
184166	184986	Were they playing a sport?
185006	185726	Were they beating each other up?
185746	186826	They didn't show any pictures of it.
186886	188607	It was just like the artwork for it.
188627	189607	I was like, Kunio game.
189767	190447	I mean, I don't care.
190507	191047	It's Kunio.
192668	196809	The same guy who I surprised was also surprised that I played Ragnarok Online.
197189	198890	He was apparently one of the people who worked on it.
199610	200630	Oh, very cool.
200710	202270	I was like, hey, you're my hero.
202470	203811	You have created my addiction.
204551	207873	If you want to talk to DarkSakura about Kunio, you can join our chat room.
207913	210594	It's chat.allgames.com for tonight.
211294	213935	But everything is actually filtered through Bobby tonight.
214056	217597	Because I left the Ibyuk at home.
217737	220098	I call it the Ibyuk after Bjork because I love her.
220679	222900	So I have my Ibyuk back at the hotel.
223260	226401	So DarkSakura and Loki and myself have no way of seeing chat.
226561	227962	Only Bobby.
228402	229443	So be nice to me.
230363	232664	I can see from here and I can laugh at people.
233384	237986	We will take calls a little later on in the program, but if you're calling in right now, too bad, we're playing a game.
238266	242188	Just to say something to Fantav.
242328	246790	I've been looking for Gravity every year so I can ask him where's Ragnarok Online 2.
246870	249871	Wasn't Ragnarok Online 2 supposed to be last year's E3?
250191	251071	I have no idea.
251151	252352	Gravity never shows up.
252492	255193	They're too busy banning people.
255353	262735	There is actually a Wikipedia article up for Ragnarok Online, too, that has some of the features from previous information that's been leaked.
262855	265375	So maybe you find something there.
265415	265755	I don't know.
266315	267055	There hasn't been a site.
267135	268516	They have a site for it, but it's a placeholder.
268636	268976	All right.
269176	273117	Again, for those of you guys who are listening to us and going, God, those guys don't sound normal.
273177	279138	Well, that's because we're at the E3 Outpost, and you get that nice ambient, the little club going on in the background.
279298	279678	Ooh, ooh.
280518	281779	Who's DJing down there?
281859	282300	I don't know.
282580	282840	Who's?
282980	283621	Pretty funky.
283961	285082	Lawrence is shaking his head.
285222	285342	I am.
285402	286803	I can probably check my player.
286823	288384	Let's get his card after the show.
288444	288744	All right.
289304	291626	Loki, what was something you saw today?
291646	293607	We heard about Korean Kunio.
293908	295789	What's something interesting you saw today, Loki?
296192	298633	Well, something a bit more normal, I guess.
299593	304975	We actually went and saw the Gears of War demonstration and that was pretty sexy, actually.
305936	309477	I totally dig the way Microsoft has their theater set up.
310632	312013	That's the way you do it right there.
312033	322062	Yeah, the way Microsoft had their theater for Gears of War is that you actually went in and you would put these headphones on so that all the outside noise is blocked.
322702	327786	But you can hear the Gears of War stuff clearly and that way you're not blasting the whole booth full of noise.
328467	330809	And then there's also surround sound in the floor.
330829	333652	So like when the guns went off, it vibrated your butt.
334073	335514	That's exactly how this was last year.
335975	339778	So if you want a free butt massage at E3, go check out the Gears of War demo.
339798	341961	What did you think of the game itself, though, Gears of War?
342221	343082	I thought it looked awesome.
343162	347186	I'm not really into a lot of first-person shooters, but it looked pretty solid.
347586	347927	It looked...
348667	352391	I haven't seen the Halo trailer yet, but I would say it probably looks better than Halo.
353392	355174	I don't do a lot of first-person shooters either.
355214	356015	I do do Halo.
356055	357076	I think Halo's awesome.
357637	361300	But Gears of War, what I liked about it is that it looked like it was really dummy-fied.
361761	364404	Like a lot of one-button stuff, because when...
365626	369090	And basically the developer or whoever was showing it to us went through the game twice.
369410	370811	The first time, or the level.
371072	374675	The first time they went through the first level and just like jammed through it.
375456	378379	They just jammed through the level and I was like, wow, that guy's doing a lot of shit.
378399	379660	I'll never be able to recreate that.
379881	385767	But then the second time he went back through the game and showed how easy it was to be hacking people with chainsaws and all the cool stuff he was doing.
386047	387528	It's a very violent game.
388149	389290	Very violent.
389350	390751	Very, very pretty, though.
391111	399016	Yeah, and it was the only minor, minor bench I have is that there was some frame rate problems, but I'm hoping... I think that's just the video.
399036	403679	Yeah, it's just a develop or whatever it is issue, and that'll be gone by the time it actually rolls out.
403899	408982	For those of you guys that are into Halo, the fact that this thing has multiplayer, this is going to be your holdover for Halo 3.
409382	410223	And it might even be...
410703	414885	A real good, like, right up there competitor with Halo 3, like Half-Life, Quake, one of those.
415125	417926	It might actually be coming out around the same time as Halo 3.
418146	421008	No, they said 2006, so we're holding them to that.
421408	424269	Well, Halo's supposed to be in 2006 also.
424329	424929	I don't believe it.
425470	427630	I say Halo 3 not until next year.
428731	429931	Well, they said otherwise.
430312	431412	I don't give a crap what they say.
431452	431912	It's not true.
432252	434393	They would have shown playable footage of E3 if it was true.
435254	435574	Good point.
436926	439508	Bobby, three interesting things, what's one of them?
440228	443050	Well, I kind of spent all day in one place, so it's kind of hard.
443471	445912	Okay, well you've got to have seen at least three demos while you were there.
445932	446853	Where did you spend your whole day?
446913	450856	I spent my whole day playing with my Wii and Nintendo.
450936	460703	You guys suck with your booth design making me wait in line for two hours so I could sit in other lines watching people play 20 minute demos.
461601	464265	So if there's four people in front of you, that's an hour just to play one game.
464365	465787	I hate Nintendo's booth this year.
465867	467429	I absolutely hate it.
467509	468951	I'm not talking about the games in it.
469231	469752	The booth?
469952	470513	I hate it.
470933	474338	It is horrible compared to the past two years.
474778	475659	It's atrocious.
476621	476961	I could just...
478503	479784	We're going to do FUs of the week later.
480084	480925	Okay, cool.
480945	481906	Did we bring One Week in Angel?
482506	483087	No, I didn't.
483567	484167	You're going to sing it.
486810	487370	No, no, later.
487390	489732	All right.
490272	493095	But I did get to play a lot with the Wii, and I'll pretty much start.
493115	497679	I mean, the first thing that I'll talk about here is probably the tech demos and some of the stuff that they're doing.
497739	498359	Okay, wait.
498439	499460	I'm going to help you here.
499560	501121	What was the first thing you went for?
501221	503303	Because you get in there, there's, what, 20 games in there.
504464	506286	You must have went right to something.
506306	506706	Okay.
507458	508098	We Orchestra.
508679	510620	Why did you pick We Orchestra?
510640	514682	Because it was the first one in the little thing to go in.
515062	518264	Were you just like, you're going to go in there like, I'm going to go around each and every one of these things?
518284	519404	It wasn't quite set up like that.
519424	523386	You had to get past this row of little mini living rooms, and then you got to the demo.
523406	525468	Well, see, and We Orchestra was in the living room.
526008	529210	It was like the least packed living room.
529330	530890	And I'm a music person, so...
532531	538235	I did it, and for those since, you know, you guys don't, you know, here on Orange Songs Radio, you guys don't really know some of my background.
538536	540277	I actually play symphonic percussion.
540737	543139	I am in two wind symphonies in the Atlanta area.
543699	546922	So I know how to conduct, because I have conducted before.
547702	553847	But what I was trying to see is, I know Dance Dance Revolution is not a dancing simulator.
553867	555909	You can't learn how to play guitar with Guitar Hero.
556429	558591	You can't conduct with Wii Orchestra.
559151	560232	It was very hard.
560252	563795	I was trying to use real conducting techniques and it's not that good yet.
563835	565897	You do have to treat it like a video game.
565937	568639	It's sometimes too sensitive, sometimes not sensitive enough.
569100	569960	But it was interesting.
570501	572643	What did you learn about the Wii controller today?
576689	579090	I learned the tech specs of it.
579110	581531	What are the tech specs of the Wiimote?
581711	584733	I don't care what... I'm calling this the Wiimote.
586053	587614	DarkSakura says Wiicon.
588274	589094	I say Wiimote.
589535	593856	So we're just always going to have this back and forth until Miyamoto can clear this up.
594237	597858	By the way, Funnydale Final Furlong was right at the very end of the booth.
597918	598238	Anyway...
601124	601705	Here's the thing.
602385	605828	Nintendo kept saying, making you think that it was kind of like a 3D mouse.
605868	607749	It would be able to tell where it was in 3D space.
607789	611212	You'd be able to put the controller on the floor and know it was on the floor.
611372	612132	No, it's not like that.
612753	618917	It's accelerometers and an IR infrared blaster, just like your TV's remote control.
619858	623181	So a lot of things, like people were saying, oh, it's so sensitive.
623581	625223	You know, when they were playing like the Duck Hunt thing.
625423	631128	That's because it's an IR, and the receiver is that little sensor that has double-stick tape that you put under your TV.
631448	634791	So the farther away you are from your TV, the less sensitive it is.
634871	636352	That's how you fix the sensitivity.
636953	640876	But since we were two feet away from the screen, it was very, very, very sensitive.
640916	644198	Well, also the thing is they're going to be adjusting the sensitivity in there.
644218	650241	You're going to have an adjustment very similar to like calibrating a mouse sensitivity.
650301	655424	Right, but I mean, what I'm saying is we could step back another foot and that would adjust the sensitivity as well.
655825	657005	And they're not telling people that.
657025	659647	They're trying to say it's some revolutionary technology.
660047	661308	Tell me more about the sensor.
661348	662989	You said it's just a little piece of tape?
663009	664570	Yeah, it's a little piece.
664590	665550	Well, no, it's not really tape.
665610	666691	It's got double stick tape.
666731	668452	That's how it attaches to your TV.
668512	669753	But you can put it on a table.
670753	675355	As long, you know, because some people were asking, you know, okay, I have a projector and I project on my wall.
676055	680176	And they're like, well, you know, you should mount it to the wall underneath where your screen is or something.
680796	681036	Huh.
681156	681917	And stuff.
682057	683897	But it's not used in every game.
684297	689639	Only in the games that actually use the IR sensor, which Excite Truck is not one of.
690139	692160	That only used the accelerometers in them.
692860	693620	Very interesting.
693640	695841	So, you know, some games don't even need that sensor.
695861	698182	You can take that sensor away and still play Excite Truck.
698682	698882	All right.
699122	700063	That was very interesting.
700203	703927	I think Bobby's going to win round one of three interesting things, because that was very interesting.
705248	706169	Well, here's mine.
706649	708411	My interesting thing I saw was Luminous 2.
710112	712955	I went and saw Luminous 2, which was being shown at Buena Vista Games.
713075	714996	You know why Luminous 2 is interesting?
715857	717819	I didn't see any damn difference from Luminous 1.
718419	720721	Not a damn thing was different from Luminous 1.
721022	727447	Okay, some of the themes were different and it seemed to have more video in the background and they've changed the look.
727808	732892	I was surprised because Luminous Live on Xbox looks a lot like Luminous 2.
734333	738137	As for new modes, whatever else, it wasn't in the demo, so I couldn't tell you.
738197	739978	And nobody at the booth told me anything extra.
740279	744402	So as far as I know, if you have Luminous, there's really no need to get Luminous 2.
745043	748646	I imagine they'll announce other things later, but they're not in the demo.
748827	750208	I started the demo from scratch.
750228	751129	It takes you right in the game.
751269	752670	In fact, some of the music was the same.
752690	755252	Yeah, some of the music and themes were the exact same.
756243	757805	DarkSakura, you got a second interesting thing for us?
777054	777895	Star Trek Legacy.
778817	779258	Ah, yes.
779518	781020	Now, this is the show that made us late.
781561	781881	Yeah.
782202	786829	We had a meeting with Bethesda to see their demo for that.
787650	788592	That was pretty sick.
791292	798376	You basically can pick from any generation of the Star Trek universe with the exception of, I think, Enterprise.
799337	802319	No, Enterprise is in there all five generations.
802499	804160	No, Enterprise was not there.
805080	806141	As in the series Enterprise.
806161	807782	Yeah, the series Enterprise, not the ship.
808362	812745	No, according to the trailer that they had, it included Enterprise.
812805	819909	According to them, they had Original Series, they had Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager.
820069	820470	That was it.
847635	852897	It was... They actually, on the demo, they recreated the battle from The Wrath of Khan.
853077	853957	That was pretty awesome.
854197	855998	This game is a Trekkie's wet dream.
856238	856658	Oh, yeah.
857199	858619	They went all out.
858699	865421	They have everything nailed down, like the ship specs, like you're saying, the recreation of certain scenarios.
865982	870403	And, you know, if you're into Star Trek, you're going to think it's great.
870563	872344	You have full range of motion in that game.
872404	874305	On top of that, if you are a little bit...
875425	876906	It's definitely a tactical ship game too.
876926	881530	I actually thought when we were going in there, I thought we were going to see the Star Trek MMO, which is nowhere to be seen.
881570	883352	I guess it's still in early development, but...
898624	900306	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
914273	919675	It's definitely very complete for the Star Trek hardcore fan.
919695	921536	I mean, they went to all these resources.
921876	928678	And even for the casual Trek fan, it's going to have tutorial modes that ease you into it and easy scenarios type situations.
929018	930639	And it's very pretty to look at.
930699	931959	I mean, it's a pretty, pretty game.
933440	936080	I was very impressed with Star Trek Legacy.
936561	936901	Thumbs up.
938001	938201	Yes.
938522	938762	All right.
939803	941384	Loki, one interesting thing.
942345	944567	I got to play more of the PlayStation 2 today.
945988	948770	The interesting part... Why don't you come over to my house and play PlayStation 2?
949011	949591	You mean PlayStation 3?
949651	950612	PlayStation 3.
951232	952173	I played both today.
952393	952654	All right.
952774	954295	I got it only.
954856	955776	No, PlayStation 3.
955816	958599	I actually played two different games.
960201	961603	And here's the thing.
961663	965769	The surprising thing is I'm not impressed by PlayStation 3 at all.
966731	971759	And I played one of the games I've been looking forward to ever since I saw the video, MotorStorm.
972540	972780	What...
974222	977965	What did you like about the movie that you saw?
989253	993934	What I liked about the movie, the movie made it seem like it's going to be burnout off-road type of thing.
994035	1000477	Really fast, really crazy-ass gameplay where cars are just crashing and flipping all over the place and exploding.
1000977	1002817	Fire, just lots of stuff like that.
1002957	1004238	And what was the reality of the demo?
1004338	1006698	The reality of the demo was it was just an off-road game.
1006758	1009719	Cars seemed to be driving extremely slow.
1010179	1013000	In fact, you know, a lot of times you'd fall off a cliff or whatever.
1013420	1018082	If you did happen to crash, they would do a slow-mo instant replay of it, and it was very unimpressive.
1018542	1021324	I checked out Gran Turismo HD and also not impressed by it at all.
1045043	1046104	Yeah, the paper people.
1046364	1046805	They're back.
1047145	1048246	In high def.
1049187	1049467	1080p.
1049787	1052629	They're actually kind of 3D, but they don't move.
1053410	1054771	They're just kind of stationary.
1055112	1056593	In the Grand Canyon level, they do move.
1056873	1057874	Yeah, a little bit.
1058034	1058594	But here's the thing.
1058655	1063599	If you drive past them, they're still looking behind you down the track like something's going to happen.
1063659	1064880	Well, let's give them a break, though.
1064900	1066041	It's an early, early build.
1066101	1067662	That all might still change.
1068082	1068343	You know?
1069143	1070203	It's pretty.
1070504	1071424	I'll give it that.
1071444	1073504	They're not the only game that uses paper people.
1073564	1075285	I mean, let's look at MotoGP 2006.
1075625	1077346	I played that today also.
1077526	1078186	Same problem.
1078706	1082787	The whole thing is, it's not impressive enough to get me to spend more money.
1082807	1087429	This thing has got to be leaps and bounds better than the 360 in order for me to spend that kind of money.
1087529	1093250	I'm really not seeing anything really unique and revolutionary coming out for anything on the PlayStation 3.
1093510	1095471	It's all just more of the same crap, just prettier.
1097270	1107075	I did notice though that Sonic the Hedgehog and there's a few other games I think that were on both platforms looked a little better on the PlayStation 3.
1107115	1109036	The Sonic looked a little bit better.
1111597	1116740	Mobile Suit Gundam looked extremely better than the 360 version.
1116940	1120862	I don't know if it's the monitors that they're playing on, but it looked like night and day for that.
1121826	1125628	Pretty Graphics can't make me forgive the botched job done on Sonic.
1127529	1129570	Alright, Bobby, how's the chatroom doing?
1130430	1131070	They're doing fine.
1131110	1133932	They're bitching about G4 right now, actually.
1133972	1136653	They're asking if we went by G4's booth and what was going on.
1136693	1138094	I avoided it at all costs.
1138634	1145557	I heard a bunch of monkeys outside the booth today going, Oh my god!
1145597	1146678	What were they cheering for?
1147649	1149129	Attack of the Show, I think, was live.
1149189	1150070	Hi, Mom, I'm on TV.
1150350	1151990	Oh, Kevin Pereira, I want to suck your dick.
1152110	1154191	I love you.
1154791	1155491	Yeah, pretty much.
1155511	1157231	Yeah, no, not for me.
1157432	1159072	I kept running into them today.
1159092	1162233	They have, like, group babes doing, like, weird things.
1162293	1168834	Now, you brought this up when we were walking around, that there was not a swarm of G4 people like there was in years past.
1168854	1170095	That's because they're not a gaming channel.
1170115	1170735	Well, right, I know.
1171195	1172535	They're off getting guys.
1173015	1173396	Yeah.
1174296	1174816	Did they get you?
1176658	1177599	No, that's their slogan.
1177619	1178479	We get guys.
1178499	1179420	They're all getting guys.
1179580	1180240	That's why I'm asking you.
1180260	1180720	Did they get you?
1181321	1181581	Uh-huh.
1181741	1182301	Did they get you?
1182482	1182662	No.
1182862	1183542	Okay, good.
1184783	1185663	No, they don't have me.
1186384	1187024	I hid from them.
1187044	1188505	Here's the thing, though.
1188825	1193788	I see swarms of GameTap shirts, which is okay because I like GameTap.
1193828	1194029	Right.
1194329	1196490	But I was surprised at that.
1196750	1198972	I don't think they're working for GameTap.
1198992	1201033	Was GameTap giving away something to shirt holders?
1201393	1202334	They were giving away shirts.
1203694	1204775	I missed that one out.
1204935	1208196	Well, yeah, but you don't wear your shirts that you win the next day.
1208617	1210778	Some people do.
1210858	1212319	Oh, okay.
1212379	1212759	Sorry.
1214380	1215640	He's a freak.
1216020	1221803	The shirts I get at E3, I wear to the gym, which isn't very often, but that's where they get used.
1222203	1225405	That's my wardrobe is all my E3 shirts, and I haven't gotten a single one this year.
1225685	1226065	I know.
1226125	1229527	I'm going to be naked next week, and I'm a fat man, so that's not a good thing.
1229727	1232768	Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
1250066	1251708	DarkSakura,
1266685	1268446	I got a clock from the Korean people.
1268927	1270748	Pretty soon E3 is going to be online.
1271769	1273450	That's fine, though, because I hate traffic here.
1273950	1277152	I wish they'd move E3 to Vegas or somewhere that's built to hold a convention.
1277172	1278433	I think they should bring it back to Atlanta.
1278513	1279594	I loved it when it was in Atlanta.
1279654	1281975	Yeah, but you have selfish reasons for that.
1282556	1285078	I actually wouldn't mind going to Atlanta.
1285138	1286018	I wouldn't mind either.
1286058	1286999	I'm sure it's a great place.
1287019	1290881	Because then I can go to E3 and drive back to Mobile and hang out with my family and then fly home.
1291062	1291862	I don't think you're right.
1291942	1295484	Dear ESA, please have E3 in Mr. Blackwell's backyard.
1295524	1296085	Yes.
1297266	1299127	Speaking of Bobby, one interesting thing.
1300027	1300968	Another one, number two.
1301048	1301748	Yeah, another one.
1302308	1306410	One thing, since more Wii, since apparently I played the Wii all day today.
1306571	1307631	You played with your Wii all day long.
1307651	1308592	I played with my Wii.
1308732	1309232	That's impressive.
1309252	1310152	And here's the thing.
1310953	1317216	A lot of people are actually wondering about, and this is more about the IR games.
1317556	1320438	They're like, oh, my arm's going to get tired when I play these games all that much.
1320598	1322640	Your arm gets tired after you play with your Wii too long.
1342202	1350812	Yes, WarioWare does make you do hula hoops and squats and stuff like that, but not all the games are going to really tire you out.
1351572	1358480	And so I thought that was kind of interesting, you know, how natural I could actually be laying on the couch and playing some of these games.
1359781	1362024	I think there actually need to be more games that wear people out.
1364040	1370462	DarkSakura wants Wii Torture Chamber.
1371002	1372522	No, I don't want Wii Torture Chamber.
1372562	1377144	I want, like, Wii Robics and, like, Wii Boot Camp.
1377864	1379244	Wii Boot Camp sounds better.
1379524	1380104	Wii Boot Camp.
1380124	1382285	Because I think about Dance Aerobics and I'm like...
1383390	1386532	They could fully bring back Dance Aerobics on the Wii.
1386692	1386912	No.
1387813	1391895	Hook up a DDR mat and then have the controller and there you go.
1391915	1393756	That's pretty much the same thing with the eye toy.
1394897	1397138	Yeah, but this is by Nintendo, so it'll be better.
1397158	1397818	So it'd be awesome.
1397998	1399019	You know it and I know it.
1399059	1402161	If they brought out a new Dance Aerobics, you'd play it once and that would be it.
1402921	1403141	No.
1403422	1403842	That's me.
1404062	1404422	I would.
1404442	1406023	Alright, anyway.
1406263	1410646	My second interesting thing I saw today would be the Eye of Judgment.
1411226	1412187	Did you make your judgment on it?
1413007	1414448	I did make a judgment on it.
1414968	1418730	What a waste of fucking space at the PlayStation 3 booth.
1418870	1421431	What a waste of fucking space.
1422072	1430316	And I'm sorry to the guys that developed this because I'm sure they worked very hard on this, but now is not the time to be showing me the eye of judgment.
1430636	1432557	The eye of judgment could have been done on the PS2.
1434994	1448442	From my perspective, now granted I don't know any tech stuff about PS3, the Eye of Judgment, for those that don't know what the Eye of Judgment is, it's that thing they showed at the conference where you put the car down and whoosh, a monster comes onto the screen.
1448462	1449783	It looked like Yu-Gi-Oh.
1450043	1455247	I guess it's supposed to be a game, but the people admitted that it wasn't really a game but more like a tech demo.
1456207	1456587	I don't know.
1456647	1458049	Loki, you saw the Eye of Judgment.
1458089	1458809	What was your thoughts?
1458989	1459750	Well, here's the thing.
1460250	1470638	When basically you have to put down a card and the eye toy, or it wasn't really an eye toy, it was just a camera, would recognize these barcode light things on top and bottom of the card.
1471119	1476443	And there's also like four triangles on it to kind of orient the card so it knows which direction it's facing because that's important.
1477403	1481065	So basically it will spawn whatever monster based on what card it is.
1481305	1484066	Now here's the thing that really kind of bugged me about it.
1484206	1496312	You can cast spells on your monsters as well, but the spell card is put on top of the monster card, and you have to remember to take the card off after the spell is cast, otherwise it casts again, because it's stupid.
1496952	1505099	and also if you're playing the game and happen to destroy a monster you have to remember to take it off the board otherwise it spawns the monster again because it's stupid.
1505379	1507721	Yeah, the Eye of Judgment has an IQ of about 3.
1509042	1512425	Here's the other thing that the geniuses... They need a brain of judgment.
1512485	1514707	Here's the geniuses that Sony didn't think about.
1515068	1518871	Okay, this game uses actual cards like magic cards or something like that.
1519292	1523496	Well, if you're actually going to be playing this game, they're playing on selling expansion packs later on.
1523716	1524717	Here's the only problem here.
1525017	1529021	You can probably scan those cards and print them back out again, and there you go.
1529041	1533886	You have two cards because the camera's not going to know the difference between a fake and a real card.
1535531	1539314	Bobby, who are those cats in Ken's show we saw the first day that are here tonight?
1539574	1540515	NoVint Falcon.
1540615	1541675	Okay, NoVint.
1542176	1543296	N-O-V-I-N-T.
1543336	1546118	Describe NoVint for the listeners real quick, and there's a reason I'm doing this.
1546298	1560968	Okay, NoVint Falcon, basically what it is, it's a PC peripheral, and it takes USB, and essentially it has touch sensitive, so it's a little ball, and I will link it in chat because I've got to go find it on Google, and I'll put the link in chat.
1560988	1563570	I think it's NoVint.com slash Falcon.htm or something like that.
1565651	1573695	You put your fingers on this little ball, and say there is a ball on the screen, you actually push forward and it will stop at the ball.
1573755	1581439	You can actually trace around the ball, and then if they have ridges on it, you can actually feel the ridges as you touch the ball.
1581820	1587362	Or if you have balls, you can have a rubber band, and it will actually pull you around.
1587422	1590224	You can feel your balls right there in your hand.
1590544	1592906	So we have gone from the weed to the balls.
1593046	1593927	No, but seriously though.
1594107	1595268	Explicit tag, here we come.
1595288	1597489	Yeah, I think we have to explicit this show.
1600357	1602258	The point is that these are all tech demos.
1602638	1605780	But this, they also have, what was it, Half-Life they were showing?
1605800	1607561	They had Half-Life 2 and something else.
1607681	1608622	And they are here tonight.
1608802	1609122	Yeah.
1609542	1610282	Now here's the thing.
1610743	1613464	That, I went and played that and I thought, this is great.
1613644	1615145	Why isn't this on a console?
1615785	1619027	That is what Sony should be having in their little rooms right now.
1619127	1623389	The Eye of Judgment is, it is not time for the Eye of Judgment.
1623810	1624130	Okay?
1624150	1624430	No.
1625780	1630864	I would have been far more impressed if Sony had teamed up with those NoVent guys and were showing that thing.
1631324	1633525	It's not a smart name to be calling that either.
1634386	1635266	The Eye of Judgment.
1635506	1639749	I judge this crap.
1639849	1643231	It is NoVent.com.
1643271	1644592	We've got to keep things moving.
1644712	1647774	If you guys are listening live, Gamer Andy will be on momentarily.
1647814	1648654	I'm looking right at him.
1648694	1649275	He's sitting there.
1649315	1650015	Hi, Gamer Andy.
1650175	1651896	How are you doing?
1651956	1653857	We're starting to butt into his time a little bit.
1653877	1654178	That's fine.
1654858	1655238	DarkSakura
1677751	1680032	Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins on PSP.
1681012	1681952	It was pretty!
1682533	1687574	Now, this is not the same as the Capcom Classics thing that also has Ghosts and Goblins, right?
1687594	1689795	This is an all-new Ghosts and Goblins game.
1689955	1691976	What's so funky new about it?
1692756	1696517	You don't get golden armor, you get, like, blue pimp armor or something.
1697178	1703960	And, like, one of the enemies, the new one, is these hands that reach out of the ground and grab you and, like, throw you into a vat of acid or...
1705134	1708075	I did go on one of the bosses, because I actually knew weapons.
1708295	1709215	And you have a refillable life bar.
1731716	1735238	But when that's out, then you turn into the naked guy.
1735619	1736379	Oh, that's cool.
1736960	1739581	That seems to help the difficulty a little bit, I think.
1740362	1743684	I actually avoided them at first because I thought they were the holy water, and the holy water sucks.
1744345	1745906	One of your weapons is a crossbow.
1745966	1748107	You also have little bombs.
1748968	1754712	You start off with the lances, of course, which I still think are the better weapon.
1755232	1757834	You also get a vine whip, which really sucks ass.
1760043	1773973	Another cool thing about that, this made me laugh, I actually took a little bit of video of this, sort of stealthily, is one of the curse forms that he can get is as a woman.
1774734	1775074	Wow.
1775635	1777336	Which I would think that would be a blessing.
1777436	1779037	What a curse indeed.
1779077	1786022	Hey, hey, it actually made the boss fight better, because she is like in this big, she looks very...
1788154	1792918	Peasant German, you know, like you see in the old history books.
1794199	1799744	In a big dress, and she'd sort of float in the air, sort of like Princess Peach.
1799764	1801305	Which was cool because you could still attack.
1801505	1803747	She would just move slower, like a really huge woman.
1804267	1806949	But you throw attacks while you're floating in the air, and you could still hit the boss.
1808371	1812374	It actually ended up being more convenient, but of course when you get hit, you lose the form again.
1813034	1814355	But I enjoyed it immensely.
1814395	1815556	The music was still good.
1817559	1821024	It was also right next to Tekken, so I was going between the two for a while.
1822987	1829910	But, my, you know, and I actually wasn't too sure about it at first until I talked to Dan on the phone yesterday.
1829950	1832912	He's like, you were going to go play Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins.
1833212	1834332	Okay.
1834833	1836073	So I did, and I had a good time.
1836093	1836693	It was pretty fun.
1837034	1842476	And I was almost hanging out with Julie, Custom E19, who she was over there playing Ace Combat.
1842736	1843036	Right on.
1843257	1844517	She's like, I don't like this game.
1845317	1847398	I was like, go play Ghosts and Goblins.
1847418	1848519	She's like, no.
1849519	1850200	But no, it was great.
1850220	1851240	It was fantastic.
1851881	1852221	Loki.
1853934	1860843	Actually, the surprising game that I saw today was this game that's probably from a company no one's ever heard of.
1861984	1867672	It's actually by this group called On Games, and the game was called Wild Summer.
1868493	1868713	Now,
1869774	1878083	Basically, this game is like a sandbox game, very similar to Grand Theft Auto, but it's basically like kind of a plotline to American Pie.
1878123	1884029	You're this, you know, trouble-starting teenager, you know, with hormones raging.
1885110	1887653	Loki, tell them why we went to look at this game.
1887913	1892337	Because I saw the game and I'm like, ooh, I gotta go play that because it looked like Laser Suit Larry.
1892438	1892658	Well, I...
1893078	1898499	I know I saw the poster and it showed this teenage boy that was stealing panties off a clothesline.
1898860	1901740	And I was like, I have to see whatever that fucking game is.
1901760	1904221	That looks too unreal to be true.
1904921	1908302	So anyways, it looks amazing so far.
1908362	1910662	They still have about a year and a half of development left.
1910682	1912403	It's supposed to be coming out in fall of 2007.
1913503	1917164	But the thing is, it's going to be... They've got a ton of different stuff in here.
1917184	1919565	One of the things that they were showing was the kind of...
1921185	1922046	Oh, what was it?
1922986	1925808	Like the free-running type of stuff in there.
1925828	1927810	So you're jumping from buildings and stuff.
1927850	1930912	You kind of have the same Prince of Persia, like, gameplay.
1931712	1936876	It also has, you know, a bunch of mini-games, including, like, dancing, playing beach volleyball.
1937456	1940618	But they have a dating part in it, too, kind of like a dating sim.
1940918	1944341	And the way the dating sim is, it's going to be playing, like, Magic the Gathering.
1944521	1950545	You're actually going to have, like, cards for, you know, pretend you're interested in her conversation, you know, get her drunk.
1951165	1951726	Stuff like that.
1951986	1953927	It's a very ambitious game.
1953967	1956228	It sounds like there's a lot they want to do with it.
1956248	1958069	But I was really impressed with the guy.
1958089	1959430	And they were very nice to us, too.
1962212	1965674	It looked like they've gone into a lot of detail.
1965694	1969095	They've really thought out about what they want to do, like what their dream game is.
1969176	1970096	And they're going and doing it.
1970416	1971657	And I asked this question.
1972297	1973518	And Jamie, you might appreciate this.
1973578	1973878	I don't know.
1973938	1976320	I said, why would a woman ever want to play this game?
1977818	1979399	I said, what is in this for a woman?
1980019	1984521	And basically what they said is that we have women on staff helping us write this game.
1984601	1986881	We're not out to make a tacky game.
1987322	1989902	Leisure Suit Larry is now a tacky franchise.
1990243	1993164	We're out to make a fun game.
1993364	1995865	That's why there's no nudity in this game.
1995925	1996585	Sorry, guys.
1996645	1997705	There's no nudity.
1998305	1999546	It's not perverted.
2000006	2005169	It's just silly fun, like the American Pie or Porky's movies, those types of things.
2005489	2006930	It's just a little bit of dumb fun.
2007010	2010712	So they think that women might want to play it just because it's silly.
2010752	2012553	It's not meant to be a serious game.
2012633	2014074	That was interesting.
2014334	2015034	I'm not interested.
2015475	2016095	Really?
2017076	2017716	Take a look.
2017896	2018596	I walked by it.
2018737	2019817	No, I was over there.
2019877	2020377	I'm not interested.
2020397	2021098	What turns you on?
2022739	2025801	I don't see what fun it is to play a hormonal 16-year-old.
2026994	2030997	Well, you haven't been a hormonal 16-year-old boy, so... Exactly.
2031157	2032378	I have no interest in it.
2032458	2033999	There's nothing that links it to me.
2034160	2038523	I was spending my 16-year-old kicking off the horny 16-year-old boys.
2039244	2039764	That's all right.
2039784	2041786	They still have Desperate Housewives out there.
2042306	2042786	You know what?
2042966	2043267	Shut up.
2043427	2045568	Desperate Housewives will teach you how to cook and gossip.
2045608	2046549	That's what I found out today.
2046589	2047590	I was surprised.
2047630	2051633	They actually go into extreme detail on cooking in that game.
2051673	2055056	Yeah, it's like, you know, you can pick from recipes and all this crap...
2056505	2058547	I don't need a video game to teach me how to cook.
2058667	2063130	I am so glad I'm on the edge of this stage so I can just run down the stairs as quick as possible.
2063971	2065051	We've done this for years.
2066252	2068654	And one of these days, I'm going to combust.
2069455	2070215	And you'll be right next to me.
2070235	2074138	I was actually surprised at how thorough the Desperate Housewives game looked to be.
2074359	2076000	I was actually kind of surprised.
2076480	2079482	It's a really intricate game, but it's stupid.
2079963	2081044	I mean...
2081824	2083905	It's a great game, but stupid.
2083965	2085185	It's intricate, but stupid.
2085445	2086705	Intricately stupid.
2086765	2087005	Yeah.
2087686	2088206	What a waste.
2088426	2088826	What a waste.
2089026	2090606	But Wild Summer, you know what?
2091067	2092247	I think it'll be cute.
2092307	2092907	I want to see it.
2092947	2098929	They're working on getting it on the 360, and to be honest, there's nothing like it out there, especially on the 360.
2100509	2102590	And they had other games, too, that looked pretty good.
2102610	2104830	All right, we've got to keep it moving, guys.
2104990	2107291	Bobby, one more interesting thing from today.
2108011	2111996	Going for the Wii trifecta, because I just can't stop talking about my Wii.
2112056	2116581	Oh, wouldn't that be a Triforce, Bobby, a Triforce?
2117342	2117843	Oh, wow.
2118403	2119524	We'll be here till Friday.
2119544	2120025	Thank you.
2120546	2122087	The virtual console.
2122788	2130770	They actually had two demo units running of the Virtual Console with that new controller that they were showing that looks like a Super Nintendo controller with dual analog sticks.
2131050	2131370	Cool.
2131710	2134251	And it's a very light controller, very comfortable to me.
2135111	2136812	They had five games running.
2137352	2139053	They had one for each system, pretty much.
2139073	2139953	They had Super Mario Bros.
2139993	2147915	on the NES, Super Mario World on the SNES, Super Mario 64 on the N64, Sonic the Hedgehog on Genesis, and Bonk's Adventure on the TurboGrafx.
2147995	2148275	All right, okay.
2175754	2176655	Then I'll back off.
2176915	2180797	The thing is, though, I haven't played a TurboGrafx in so long.
2180817	2183239	I believe that Bonks worked really well.
2183479	2184440	I mean, it looked fine to me.
2184480	2188502	I didn't notice any glitches or anything, but I can't compare it to the original TurboGrafx.
2188542	2189523	Did it tell you to press run?
2190802	2192764	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2212711	2212971	All right.
2213451	2215492	Chat room question from a while ago.
2215532	2216192	Oh, yes, please.
2216232	2216632	I'm sorry.
2216992	2217912	Sorry, chat room again.
2218253	2222314	I don't have the ibyuk, so we can't look at chat, Jamie and I. But Bobby, what's chat room say?
2222354	2227195	CKY Mike, who thinks I should join you guys full time, asked what game... You want to move to Sacramento?
2227215	2228035	Yeah, I'll move to Sacramento.
2228055	2228436	How about that?
2228496	2228736	All right.
2229216	2231536	What game demos did you get to download at the PSP booth?
2231576	2232637	I believe that's a Matt thing.
2232657	2233517	That's a Loki thing.
2233757	2236038	Capcom Classic Collection Reloaded Gangs of London
2250463	2251184	was one of them.
2251484	2252905	They had Lemmings.
2254166	2258828	The one I played, Every Extended Extra.
2259088	2260770	Yeah, Every Extended Extra.
2261210	2261270	E3.
2261750	2264392	And that was okay.
2264432	2267374	They had Ratchet & Clank Size Matters.
2267454	2268434	I played that for a little bit.
2268454	2269055	That was okay.
2269715	2272937	And then I can't remember what the last game was.
2273017	2274418	It wasn't that standout.
2276437	2278098	Every extended extra seemed okay to me.
2278358	2279258	It was weird.
2279278	2280199	It was a little weird.
2280239	2284660	It wasn't what I expected from Q Entertainment, but I think it'll be a good time.
2284940	2288042	I like how they reused some of the sound effects from Luminous.
2288102	2289102	Yeah, that was funny.
2290323	2291123	DarkSakura?
2291163	2292403	No, I have an honorable mention.
2292964	2295044	Okay, yeah, let's do quick, real quick, though.
2295064	2296665	We want to try and start wrapping this up.
2296885	2300206	We are going to take a couple quick, quick phone calls, though.
2300447	2301347	Bobby, tell them how to get in.
2302150	2303371	Okay, you can call 1-866-880-0156.
2307673	2307953	All right.
2308013	2309253	Soul free number in the United States.
2309273	2310914	Some quickies first, DarkSakura.
2311274	2311954	WTF.
2312515	2314376	The WTF game is amazing.
2315176	2316516	I chopped rabbits in half.
2316557	2317157	It was great.
2318257	2319458	I did the wood chopping game.
2320399	2324522	Basically, it's a bunch of really, really messed up mini games.
2325062	2330466	And the ones that Julie and I actually played was the wood chopping game, where you chop wood for money.
2330546	2333728	Only the thing is that the grandma lady will randomly put out an animal.
2333928	2338151	The chicken sorting game was fantastic because you could do... It looks very WarioWare-ish.
2338171	2340873	You sort them as boys, girls, or dead.
2340893	2341734	Ha ha ha!
2342154	2344016	No, I said, what, Heaven?
2344216	2344956	Yeah, Heaven.
2345197	2346298	Because they're dead.
2346358	2347218	That's why they go to Heaven.
2347238	2347919	But that's great.
2348219	2349380	That made me go WTF.
2349420	2349840	It's a great town.
2349880	2350441	All right, we've got to go.
2350541	2351742	It was work time fun.
2351942	2352923	Let's go to the telephone.
2352963	2354084	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2354124	2354524	Who's this?
2355425	2356706	Hi, Seproth1215.
2357066	2359228	Seproth1215, what's on your mind?
2359248	2360269	We've got to make it quick tonight.
2361070	2367975	Okay, I was going to say, there has been a little bit of an update for the Imani booth.
2368255	2368436	Yeah.
2369878	2372820	I did not hear, you said Guitar Freaks broke?
2372841	2375322	No, Guitar Freaks was a response to Guitar Hero
2396605	2403054	I think that they had the guitar freaks and the mania there to have people come over to their booth.
2403475	2403996	That was it.
2404316	2413429	I think it was a press attention thing showing, I think they wanted to show, look at our arcade machines, look at, we are bringing the arcade experience home.
2413909	2418152	But the weird thing about that, I don't understand the logic of a Guitar Freaks being there.
2418212	2423496	I still don't, but maybe they want to show, hey, we've been doing this in the arcade for a long time.
2423997	2427720	I'm not one to say why they have that there, if it is a response to Guitar Hero or what.
2427740	2434605	Or maybe they're like me in seeing how non-innovative Guitar Hero is, because it's been out forever in Japan as Guitar Freaks.
2434625	2438428	See, but I disagree, because I do think Guitar Hero is innovative, but in a different way than you do.
2439228	2440249	Or you don't, I should say.
2440269	2440629	Um...
2441791	2444918	And what was the other part of that you said that they were reporting, Sephiroth?
2444938	2449789	They said that 2DX was there because of...
2450919	2455041	They wanted to show the press how cool it would be and the potential that it has.
2456141	2457022	I would agree with that.
2457102	2466426	Why not show the press the arc- Because a lot of people, when the Beatmania trailer showed, it said bringing the arcade experience home, and a lot of people said, what arcade experience?
2466786	2469627	And I think Konami just wanted to show what these games look like.
2469887	2474289	And I'll tell you what, there were lots of cameras filming both of those games.
2474589	2476870	That's what Konami wants, people filming their stuff.
2477630	2479231	Nothing wrong with a little attention, right?
2480523	2492987	Well, yeah, but the problem with that is they did say that they don't have any plans for another US sequel because they don't know whether or not it's sold well enough.
2493847	2501329	Now, the problem I have with that is if I look back on DDR, I mean, they went on for a while and probably didn't sell well until maybe at least Max.
2501910	2503090	Actually, it did sell pretty well.
2504753	2508355	Maybe that was the nice way of saying, we just can't tell you anything right now.
2508575	2513517	I think, honestly, that was the nice way of saying, we can't talk about it.
2515318	2515958	I hope so.
2516138	2517239	Alright, we'll hope so too.
2517359	2520160	Seproth, we gotta let you go to take another call, but thanks for calling, alright?
2520760	2521420	Alright, thanks.
2522121	2524122	Alright, we got another one already?
2524562	2525902	Loki, real quick, before we answer this.
2526883	2527103	Yes.
2527703	2528784	Oh, I thought you had a comment.
2528804	2529024	No.
2529184	2530104	Oh, alright, we'll go to the phone.
2530144	2531765	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
2533599	2535040	Hey, this is SilentWind96 again.
2535120	2536601	SilentWind96.
2537001	2538222	Nice to meet you last night.
2538262	2539203	Congratulations.
2540004	2541865	Hey, thanks for getting me in, guys.
2542105	2542686	No problem.
2542706	2544527	What did you think of the E3 Outpost?
2545808	2546189	Oh, I loved it.
2546289	2547189	It was a lot of fun.
2547530	2547930	Awesome.
2547990	2549411	If you're in the LA area, come on down.
2549431	2551012	We're right off Santa Monica and 405.
2552714	2553895	What did you call in about?
2555732	2559255	I just want to extend my thanks again for letting me hang out with you guys.
2559575	2562058	I'm on my way home back to Bakersfield.
2562118	2568743	I've got to be up at 3 o'clock in the morning to go to work.
2568763	2569524	Poor guy.
2569964	2570665	Thanks for the call.
2570705	2571666	I'm glad you had a good time.
2571686	2573467	What was something fun you did while you were here?
2576010	2583296	At the outpost, I was able to talk to some of the guys from Intellivision and
2584389	2587993	Check out the demo for Lost Planet, which is awesome.
2588253	2588554	Yeah.
2591502	2595983	Watch Bobby Platt kick in Uno by the computer.
2596623	2597024	That's right.
2597204	2602505	Now, SilentWind96 brought us the full version of Uno for us to take a look at.
2602565	2603325	And I love him for it.
2603405	2604566	What did you guys think of Uno?
2605006	2607266	Well, I had a little bit to drink.
2608587	2608907	A little.
2609647	2611928	And I was sitting back going, Uno.
2612608	2613208	So, yeah.
2615289	2616369	It was Uno.
2617569	2618970	I had four Astro Smashes.
2619350	2619770	Black Wolf?
2623028	2624448	The computer is a cheese monkey.
2625209	2626609	The computer is a bitch.
2627049	2627690	I'm sorry.
2627770	2629010	The computer is evil.
2629030	2630671	I think he went for...
2636246	2636926	DarkSakura.com
2660494	2662715	That makes me warm and fuzzy and kind of ill.
2663395	2664256	No, I'm just kidding.
2664376	2664836	I'm kidding.
2665577	2665857	All right.
2666898	2668419	That was my thought, too.
2669560	2671421	I'm going to have to get my own gamer tag now.
2672321	2673202	You should.
2673322	2675303	Silent Wind, any other thoughts for our listeners?
2676844	2680767	No, just that if you ever get a chance to go down there, that's a great place to hang out.
2681483	2684486	I appreciate your support.
2684566	2686107	You're a true buddy.
2686167	2689030	And what do you think of the set here?
2689170	2690351	I love this set.
2690371	2693074	Silent Wind, what did you think of the set?
2709810	2710690	Oh, I love the NES.
2710710	2712731	The NES set was awesome.
2713232	2715112	I did take pictures with Sky's camera.
2715152	2715453	Oh, good.
2715493	2716393	We'll get those up on the site.
2717093	2717453	Thank you.
2718094	2720395	All right, Silent Wind, we've got to let you go because you're going to get more calls.
2720435	2721635	So thanks for calling in, all right?
2722155	2723136	All right, you take care now.
2723176	2723916	All right, you too, buddy.
2723936	2724557	It was good to meet you.
2725477	2732560	All right, that was Silent Wind, our random contest winner from last night who got to come down here and be on the E3 Outpost.
2733040	2733661	Check it out here.
2736189	2738192	Bobby, remind the kids how to call in if they want.
2738212	2738933	We'll do a couple more.
2739293	2740755	Toll free number in the United States, 1-866-880-0156.
2747270	2750735	I wanted to mention another cool game I played was Hot Pixel.
2751215	2752196	That game was awesome.
2752216	2757664	It's just basically WarioWare on the PSP with old retro Atari games in there as well.
2758224	2759125	Friggin' awesome.
2759566	2761949	Lots of good WarioWare type games coming to the PSP.
2761989	2763671	You mean Atari was showing more than one game?
2764072	2764272	Yeah.
2767445	2769286	HotPixel is fun.
2769747	2773810	And the guy, I guess, who made it or whatever is a crazy-ass French guy.
2774310	2779053	I mean, he has this weird skateboard with carpet on it and a fucking PSP holder in there.
2779674	2780394	What a nut.
2780534	2781195	But you know what?
2782015	2782556	It was cool.
2782836	2783897	It was nice to meet him.
2784577	2786118	He actually has a podcast, too.
2786258	2787779	I don't even remember the name of it, but...
2789020	2790221	Just a weird guy.
2790522	2793044	It's kind of like Mark Echoes on Crackin' French.
2793144	2796847	Eccentric guy, but I was surprised with Hot Pixel.
2796887	2797848	I thought it would suck.
2798388	2805915	But it was actually kind of... It was cute in a... I don't even know how to describe it.
2806015	2806275	It was...
2808217	2811480	Such a weird, quirky, but in a different type of element.
2811700	2816745	I mean, the game is totally just like WarioWare, but the minigames are so different.
2817305	2818266	That's what I like about it.
2818586	2820628	I don't know.
2821169	2823651	I have another quickie for you guys.
2823691	2826353	99 Nights, I thought was great.
2828155	2831698	I thought, it's just mass murder the game.
2831858	2832459	I loved it.
2835081	2845447	It's a little bit of button mashing, but I mean, there's a lot of stuff going on on the screen and people... GamerAndy's doing a dance.
2845507	2846908	Is this the 99 Nights dance?
2847928	2850190	GamerAndy, say hi on Orange Lounge Radio.
2850230	2852711	Do a plug for your spiel and tell us about 99 Nights.
2852731	2853412	Hi, GamerAndy.
2853432	2853932	What's on your mind?
2854301	2856384	Hi, this is Adam from GamerAndy Live.
2856704	2857405	How are you today?
2857545	2858266	I am great!
2858326	2858967	That's great!
2859047	2860328	What do you think of 99 Nights?
2860388	2867757	You know, I played it at the Spring Preview and I honestly thought it was more along the realms of the button-mashing, Dynasty Warriors-esque sort of thing.
2867777	2868177	Yeah, exactly.
2868217	2869699	Which personally isn't really for me.
2869739	2870600	You didn't like it?
2871081	2871982	No, no dude.
2872182	2873262	Didn't like the cutscenes?
2873342	2875203	Didn't like any of that stuff?
2875483	2879764	Um, you know, the cutscenes were alright, but honestly, I really just didn't quite get into it.
2880345	2882465	It wasn't my groove, dude.
2882665	2883326	Sorry to hear it.
2883566	2885426	Yeah, you know, I mean, I wanted to like it, though.
2885706	2886006	Alright.
2886587	2887787	Give a quick plug for your stuff.
2888267	2890828	Gamer Andy Live, tonight, after these guys.
2891208	2893189	After Orange Lines Radio, which rocks, by the way.
2893329	2893429	Woo!
2893609	2894069	Thank you.
2894089	2894769	Appreciate it.
2895369	2895789	Alright.
2896710	2897090	He's drunk.
2897190	2898770	We gotta give the mic back to JBL.
2899271	2900151	Alright, um...
2901505	2902346	I had business.
2903247	2904127	I like 99 Nights.
2904748	2905869	It's a little bit of button mashing.
2905909	2908351	It's like Golden Axe, but like, I don't know.
2908971	2910353	That was what I was thinking about when I'm playing.
2910373	2912194	I'm like, this is like Golden Axe, but with more.
2912214	2913335	I don't know.
2913355	2914336	I see Sonic.
2916798	2918180	Mortal Kombat Armageddon.
2918200	2919681	Did anyone else play this besides me?
2919881	2920582	Hell no.
2920862	2923485	You were a green vampire chick with an axe.
2923545	2926467	Created character is always awesome in my book.
2926607	2934375	And even though I'm a little disappointed Armageddon is only for the current gen stuff, I think created character was great.
2935155	2939480	Of course the created character that was in there when I loaded it up was a naked woman.
2940020	2941241	But how many of those have we seen?
2941361	2943362	I mean, when I say naked, I mean, you know, bikini.
2943402	2945483	But how many of those have we seen in video games?
2945503	2948205	So I was going to make a fun female character.
2948525	2953848	So I made a green vampire bitch with a huge meat cleaver as her weapon, and it was awesome.
2954668	2955189	And you won.
2955669	2955989	I did.
2956069	2957310	I kicked the shit out of whoever.
2957330	2961812	I don't even remember what I was playing against, some Ermac or something, but it was cool.
2962073	2962513	I liked it.
2964543	2985248	I think it's a little like if you have the other two Mortal Kombat games from this current generation I don't think there's a lot else here but I mean if you're a fan of Mortal Kombat I think you'll have a good time any other oh we got a call let's go to the phones and answer the phones hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio
2986454	2987416	Hey guys, Jason.
2987976	2989859	Hey Jason, what's up?
2990220	2992102	How are you guys enjoying it down there?
2992463	2994426	Good, this is Jason, our webmaster, Jason.
2996429	2997310	Hi Jason.
2997350	2998231	We miss having you here.
2998451	3000234	Why I wish you were here, Jason.
3000274	3000955	Why aren't you here?
3002074	3005255	I'm not here, I'm not there because my truck demands me being here.
3006435	3007835	Oh, I'm sorry, Jason.
3007855	3011516	And insurance and all those, you know, things that actually require money for no good reason.
3012096	3013156	Oh, I hate that stuff.
3013476	3015917	What did you want to call in and say to our listeners?
3016037	3022958	Besides the fact that you rock because you do our website stuff for us, it's a thankless job and I love you for it, you know that.
3022978	3025059	What did you want to say to our listeners?
3025099	3025699	You're very efficient.
3026778	3033934	I heard about the existence of Guitar Man Live and I'm wondering if they've actually had a booth up and if you guys have got any more information on it.
3035595	3037897	Guitaroman Live, we got into a little bit.
3037957	3041579	It's Guitaroman Lives.
3043080	3044341	It's a port.
3044661	3046262	It's the same thing as the PS2.
3046402	3047483	It has duet mode.
3048464	3053547	It has some little things, but if you're looking for new songs... No, no.
3055528	3057830	But if you accidentally pause it, you can continue.
3057870	3059131	You don't have to restart from the beginning.
3060848	3061669	Anything else, Jason?
3072513	3073073	Not really.
3073133	3076635	I was hoping that it was mostly a new game, especially with the duet mode.
3076695	3080536	It was actually going to further the storyline or anything along those lines.
3080796	3085177	We were a little disappointed it's not a new game either, but at least the franchise isn't dead.
3085397	3086678	I guess that's the silver lining.
3086718	3088218	At least they're still interested.
3088618	3090379	So we'll see how it does on the market.
3092179	3093540	Jason, thanks so much for calling in.
3093560	3094280	Have a good one, okay?
3095114	3095855	DJ Food Eater
3124767	3127169	DJ Poo Eater Oh, DJ Poo Eater!
3127570	3128350	Hey!
3128951	3129772	What's on your mind?
3130012	3131053	You're breaking up a little bit.
3132014	3135857	Get your thought out there.
3137839	3139160	I didn't get that out.
3139841	3142863	DJ Poo Eater, we're gonna have to let you go, buddy.
3143204	3146887	DJ Poo Eater, we're gonna have to let you go because you're breaking up too much, but thanks for trying.
3147167	3148048	Maybe try again tomorrow.
3148949	3150230	Alright, have a good one.
3152622	3154583	Alright, let's go to another call.
3154643	3155563	Let's try a different call.
3156083	3157724	Oh, they have no time.
3157904	3158584	Oh, here it is again.
3159184	3160265	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3161405	3162385	Hi, this is Jaded2006.
3163566	3166307	Jaded2006, what's on your mind, buddy?
3167487	3168327	Oh, nothing much.
3168487	3170948	This is mainly a question for Bobby.
3171808	3172389	Bobby!
3173269	3174289	A question for Bobby.
3175190	3176690	Bobby, taking over our show.
3176730	3177370	Thanks a lot.
3177470	3178091	No, what's up?
3178131	3179031	What's the question for Bobby?
3180459	3183061	What is your honest opinion about Wii Music?
3207257	3209698	But all it was was playing the Zelda theme.
3210018	3212879	Yeah, you can cue other places.
3213139	3215860	You can cue the back of the orchestra and they'll play louder.
3215880	3219260	You can slow them down and start them up, but it takes a little while to get used to it.
3219280	3220341	I only played through it twice.
3220761	3224362	When you play that game, do you look as fruity as Miyamoto did at the conference?
3224962	3231149	No, I actually look, I look like a real, most people do, because they're like, you know, just waving their arms and like dancing around like he did.
3231169	3238856	You know, when I say Miyamoto's being fruity, I tease with love, because that's why we love him, is because he's just a crazy little man.
3240404	3245325	Just to point out, though, you were mentioning about having a hard time actually conducting for real with it.
3245705	3252507	I did also, when I went through there, Koji Kondo was playing, and he actually, I could tell, wasn't doing true conducting.
3252607	3252847	Right.
3252887	3262229	Yeah, you have to do it like, you know, it's really rigid, and it looks like it's actually, if you know anything about conducting, it's actually the up motion is what triggers it, not the down motion.
3262589	3264490	I learned that right at the very end of my second thing.
3264510	3266050	I'm like, oh, it's going on the up.
3266810	3267150	All right.
3267810	3270732	Jaded2006, any other thoughts for us?
3271032	3273493	Is it as easy as Miyamoto made it look?
3273693	3274253	How about that?
3274933	3275153	Yeah.
3275994	3282376	I mean, you're not going to be good at it, but yeah, I mean, it's, you know, waving your arms like people who've never done music stuff were able to get through it.
3282957	3283437	All right.
3283557	3284897	And it does score you at the end.
3286038	3289119	Jaded2006, we've got to let you go.
3289139	3290560	We're going to start wrapping it up, all right?
3291882	3292922	All right, thanks so much for the call.
3293062	3294283	Have a good one.
3294303	3295363	You have a good one, too.
3295583	3295863	All right.
3295883	3296363	Bye.
3296383	3300945	Poor Spirit Snare has been trying to call in for like the past 30 minutes, and somebody else always gets in.
3302085	3304766	Well, we've got the wrap-up sign, so we've got to start wrapping it up.
3304806	3308167	Spirit Snare, tomorrow, buddy, call in.
3308187	3308707	We'll get you.
3308727	3309387	I'm so sorry.
3309947	3311648	But, of course, there's always the forums.
3312008	3312888	There's LiveJournal.
3312908	3315929	This is for anybody that wants to talk to us, but maybe is too shy to call in.
3316349	3319530	Our Stuff blog, stuff.orangeballonsradio.com.
3320390	3321971	even Myspace if you really want to.
3321991	3324811	We've got all that stuff going on, so check it out.
3325432	3328753	Anyway, really quickly though, real quick, I had to do this before the show's over tonight.
3328793	3329953	The FUs of the week.
3330333	3334854	Bobby, give us a little bit of the... Alright.
3335495	3335775	Alright.
3336035	3338315	DarkSakura, do you have any FUs so far at E3?
3338335	3338375	Um...
3340885	3341946	Not really, actually.
3342186	3342506	Really?
3343507	3352111	Yeah, I've actually been pretty much okay with it, except I still think, and this actually really surprised me, my husband's actually pretty happy about it.
3352692	3359656	I want to say F you to Capcom, because why the hell are you going to put NES Strider on the PSP?
3361277	3363038	Oh, they put NES Strider on the game?
3363058	3374204	Yeah, that Capcom Classics Collection is the NES versions of Mighty Final Fight, Bionic Commando, which Dan was like, Bionic Commando!
3374725	3378767	And the NES version of Strider, which actually isn't a bad game.
3379428	3381209	It's all based off of the Strider comics.
3381949	3385871	But I was like, I have these at home, I can just play them at home.
3386412	3386752	Why?
3387232	3388193	Why do I want these on my PSP?
3388233	3388633	Okay, so...
3389093	3391454	But what about those of us who don't have those at home?
3392114	3393054	Is it a bad thing to have?
3393535	3394915	You can download it.
3396215	3398356	So it is a bad thing to have if we don't have those games at home?
3399096	3400197	There's other ways to get it.
3400257	3405339	I just don't see any reason of, you know, they should have touched it up or, you know, made it a little bit cleaner.
3405379	3408380	And it is the exact port of the NES ones.
3408420	3409220	Some people like that.
3409620	3412002	We gotta keep the angst flowing because we gotta wrap it up.
3412042	3412822	Loki, your FU.
3413482	3416164	My FU goes to Nintendo for a couple reasons.
3416204	3421087	The first, because their party wasn't exactly great, even if the Black IPs were there.
3421707	3425550	And also because their booth sucks ass as far as the design goes.
3426210	3429531	and it makes it nearly impossible to play anything new that they have.
3429811	3431372	Notice I didn't talk about the Wii today.
3431392	3432352	That's because I didn't play it.
3432392	3441076	I tried to go to the line at 12.30 and they told me tough titty because they were doing a private party which was more important.
3442557	3446539	Do your private party after hours, dummies.
3447120	3448000	Bobby, your FU.
3448621	3460729	My FU goes to three people, and one of them, his name is Scott Rubin, who was supposed to be the one that was picking me up at 8.15 in the morning at my hotel so I could get there by 9 o'clock.
3461170	3462951	My second, but unfortunately he...
3463311	3464813	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3482910	3484531	who pulled some strings.
3484551	3486053	He was standing in the Nintendo line.
3486073	3489755	I was going to join him in the line and he pulled some strings and they went into the Nintendo booth.
3490296	3497802	And my third FU goes to Lawrence Young for going with him and not waiting for me because they did the Jack Bauer time going, There's no time!
3500144	3507149	And then for Lawrence Young, the last FU is for calling me and saying, Bobby B, I'm one foot away from Madden 07.
3507209	3507649	Ha ha ha!
3511131	3517655	And I was like an hour and a half away from getting in, so... I still love you, Lawrence, for whatever it's worth.
3517695	3519296	You edit the show so I don't have to.
3519316	3520716	I love you for that.
3520756	3521077	All right.
3522517	3526359	My FU goes to the people that were waiting in line to see Paris Hilton.
3526759	3528160	Yeah!
3528380	3529801	Get out of my E3!
3530241	3530741	Get out!
3531382	3533083	Those are the people that need to be sterilized.
3534264	3535265	I hope you all go sterile.
3550846	3579003	Yes, may they never breed Alright, we gotta wrap it up Final thoughts, DarkSakura, your final thought Uh Nap Loki, your final thought My final thought is I'm gonna play Crackdown tomorrow because I forgot it was there Alright Bobby, thanks for being here again Your final thought, reject false icons Thank you I also forgot to mention, two nights in a row Superman Returns is fucking awesome and it would be a better Grand Theft Auto game
3581882	3584263	My final thought is Enchanted Arms looked really pretty.
3584303	3585283	I wish they'd let me play it.
3586063	3586383	All right.
3586903	3587283	That's it.
