0	28000	We are live here at the E3 Outpost for this special Thursday, E3 2006 edition.
28000	40000	Welcome everybody to the Thursday edition of Orange Lounge Radio, live from the E3 Outpost, celebrating all things that is E3 2006.
40000	49000	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky. Joining me as always, say hello to my exhausted yet perky co-host, Dark Soccer, also known as Jamie Summers.
49000	50000	Hi.
50000	51000	How you doing?
51000	53000	I slept on the thingy.
53000	55000	On the bus? I hate L.A. traffic.
55000	58000	It took long enough that I could sleep.
58000	59000	I took proper naps.
59000	60000	Well, whatever.
60000	63000	Also, say hello to the one and only Tech Masoloki.
63000	64000	Hello.
64000	65000	How you doing?
65000	69000	I'm good. I just ate a bunch of popcorn, chicken, and bacon out of these potatoes again.
69000	71000	Loving the catering at the E3 Outpost.
71000	73000	And then I took the bacon and dipped it in barbecue sauce.
73000	75000	Good people.
75000	79000	But that's what I can do to prove super bacon to the next level.
79000	85000	Alright, next time. Also say hello, joining us again tonight, our good pal Bobby Blackwolf.
85000	86000	Yo.
86000	87000	How you doing, Bobby?
87000	89000	I'm tired. My feet hurt.
89000	91000	I am all weed out.
91000	94000	That's probably how everybody feels about E3 today.
94000	101000	Also, wave hello to Mr. Lawrence Young, who is producing us tonight. He doesn't have a mic, so he can't say hi back.
101000	102000	But this is what he would say.
102000	104000	That's me.
104000	111000	Alright, first of all, for those of you guys listening live tonight, it's about, what, 7.50, and we are supposed to be on at 6.30.
111000	114000	I apologize, especially to those of you guys on the East Coast.
114000	116000	Crap happens.
116000	120000	We were actually at a booth right up until 5.45.
120000	126000	We had an appointment at a booth, and so we actually missed the first shuttle back here to the Outpost, so we had to wait for the second one.
126000	127000	So I apologize.
127000	129000	It happens.
129000	130000	Technical difficulties.
130000	133000	Anyway, let's talk about E3 and some of the stuff we saw today.
133000	135000	We're going to play three interesting things.
135000	138000	Dark Sakura, what's one of them?
138000	144000	There's a, I went to the games of Korea, or whatever they called it.
144000	151000	And apparently one of the companies is bringing out a new Kunio game in, this is 2007.
151000	157000	But they're basically giving rebirth to the Kunio franchise, which I thought was pretty cool.
157000	160000	And he seemed absolutely surprised that I would, is that a Kunio game?
160000	163000	For those who don't know what that is, was that a popular anime?
163000	165000	It was brought over as River City Ransom.
165000	167000	Oh, shit!
167000	168000	And Dodgeball.
168000	169000	That's all I needed to hear.
169000	176000	But, um, overseas it was Hot-Blooded Downtown Story and Kunio Dodgeball.
176000	178000	What's this new game they're doing?
178000	181000	I didn't really tell much about it because I don't read Korean.
181000	183000	But it's a Kunio game.
183000	185000	What did it look like they were doing? Were they playing a sport? Were they beating each other up?
185000	188000	They didn't show any pictures of it, it was just like the artwork for it.
188000	192000	I was like, Kunio game! I mean, I don't care, it's Kunio.
192000	197000	The same guy who I surprised was also surprised that I played Ragnarok Online.
197000	199000	He was apparently one of the people who worked on it.
199000	201000	Oh, very cool.
201000	204000	I was like, hey, you're my hero. You have created my addiction.
204000	208000	If you want to talk to Dark Soccer about Kunio, you can join our chat room.
208000	211000	It's chat.allgames.com for tonight.
211000	214000	But everything is actually filtered through Bobby tonight.
214000	220000	Because I left the Eyebyuk at home. I call it the Eyebyuk after Bjork because I love her.
220000	223000	So I have my Eyebyuk back at the hotel.
223000	228000	So Dark Sakura and Loki and myself have no way of seeing chat, only Bobby.
228000	230000	So be nice to me.
230000	233000	I can see from here and I can, like, laugh at people.
233000	238000	We will take calls a little later on in the program, but if you're calling in right now, too bad. We're playing a game.
238000	242000	Just to say something to Fantas.
242000	247000	I've been looking for Gravity every year, so I can ask him where's Ragnarok Online 2.
247000	250000	Wasn't Ragnarok Online 2 supposed to be, like, last year's E3?
250000	253000	I have no idea. Gravity never shows up.
253000	255000	They're too busy banning people.
255000	263000	There is actually a Wikipedia article up for Ragnarok Online 2 that has some of the features from previous information that's been leaked.
263000	266000	So maybe you can find something there. I don't know.
266000	269000	I have a site for it, but it's a placeholder.
269000	273000	Again, for those of you guys who are listening to us and going, God, those guys don't sound normal.
273000	277000	Well, that's because we're at the E3 Outpost and you get that nice ambient.
277000	280000	The little club going on in the background.
280000	282000	Who's DJing down there?
282000	283000	I don't know.
283000	284000	Who's pretty funky?
284000	286000	Lawrence is shaking his head.
286000	287000	I can probably check my flyer.
287000	289000	Let's get his card after the show.
289000	290000	Alright.
290000	294000	Loki, what was something you saw today? We heard about Korean Kunio.
294000	296000	What's something interesting you saw today, Loki?
296000	299000	Well, something a bit more normal, I guess.
299000	305000	We actually went and saw the Gears of War demonstration, and that was pretty sexy, actually.
305000	310000	I totally dig the way Microsoft has their theater set up.
310000	312000	That's the way you do it right there.
312000	322000	Yeah, the way Microsoft had their theater for Gears of War is that you actually went in and you would put these headphones on so that all the outside noise is blocked.
322000	328000	But you can hear the Gears of War stuff clearly, and that way you're not blasting the whole booth full of noise.
328000	334000	And then there's also surround sound in the floor, so when the guns went off, it vibrated your butt.
334000	336000	That's exactly how theirs was last year.
336000	340000	So if you want a free butt massage at E3, go check out the Gears of War demo.
340000	342000	No, what did you think of the game itself, though, Gears of War?
342000	343000	I thought it looked awesome.
343000	347000	I'm not really into a lot of first-person shooters, but it looked pretty solid.
347000	353000	I haven't seen the Halo trailer yet, but I would say it probably looks better than Halo.
353000	357000	I don't do a lot of first-person shooters either. I do do Halo. I think Halo's awesome.
357000	364000	But Gears of War, what I liked about it is that it looked like it was really dummy-fied, like a lot of one-button stuff.
364000	369000	Because basically the developer or whoever was showing it to us went through the game twice.
369000	375000	The first time they went through the first level and just jammed through it.
375000	380000	They just jammed through the level, and I was like, wow, that guy's doing a lot of shit. I'll never be able to recreate it.
380000	386000	But then the second time, he went back through the game and showed how easy it was to be hacking people with chainsaws and all the cool stuff he was doing.
386000	388000	It's a very violent game.
388000	391000	Very violent. Very, very pretty, though.
391000	397000	Yeah, and the only minor, minor bench I have is that there were some frame rate problems.
397000	398000	But I'm hoping...
398000	399000	I think that's just the video.
399000	404000	Yeah, it's just a develop or whatever it is issue, and that'll be gone by the time it actually rolls out.
404000	409000	For those of you guys that are into Halo, the fact that this thing has multiplayer, this is going to be your holdover for Halo 3.
409000	415000	And it might even be a real good, right up their competitor with Halo 3, like Half-Life, Quake, one of those.
415000	418000	It might actually be coming around around the same time as Halo 3.
418000	421000	No, they said 2006, so we're holding them to that.
421000	424000	Well, Halo's supposed to be in 2006 also.
424000	428000	I don't believe it. I say Halo 3 not until next year.
428000	430000	Well, they said otherwise.
430000	432000	I don't give a crap what they say. It's not true.
432000	435000	They would have shown playable footage at E3 if it was true.
435000	436000	Good point.
436000	437000	Bobby!
437000	438000	Hi.
438000	440000	Three interesting things. What's one of them?
440000	443000	Well, I kind of spent all day in one place, so it's kind of hard.
443000	447000	Well, you've got to have seen at least three demos while you were there. Where did you spend your whole day?
447000	451000	I spent my whole day playing with my Wii and Nintendo.
451000	461000	You guys suck with your booth design, making me wait in line for two hours so I could sit in other lines watching people play 20-minute demos.
461000	464000	So if there's four people in front of you, that's an hour just to play one game.
464000	469000	I hate Nintendo's booth this year. I absolutely hate it. I'm not talking about the games in it.
469000	474000	The booth? I hate it. It is horrible compared to the past two years.
474000	478000	It's atrocious. I could just...
478000	480000	We're going to do FUs of the Week later.
480000	482000	Okay, cool. Did we bring One Wiggin' Angel?
482000	486000	No, I didn't bring it. You're going to sing it.
486000	489000	No, no, later. All right.
489000	493000	But I did get to play a lot with the Wii, and I'll pretty much start.
493000	498000	The first thing that I'll talk about here is probably the tech demos and some of the stuff that they're doing.
498000	501000	I'm going to help you here. What was the first thing you went for?
501000	507000	Because you get in there, there's what, 20 games in there. You must have went right to something.
507000	509000	Wii Orchestra.
509000	511000	Why did you pick Wii Orchestra?
511000	515000	Because it was the first one in the little thing to go in.
515000	519000	Were you just like, you're going to go in there like, I'm going to go around each and every one of these things?
519000	522000	It wasn't quite set up like that. You had to get past this row of little mini living rooms.
522000	524000	And then you got to the demos.
524000	526000	Well, see, Wii Orchestra was in the living rooms.
526000	529000	It was like the least packed living room.
529000	530000	Okay.
530000	531000	And I'm a music person.
531000	536000	So I did it, and for those, since you guys don't, you know,
536000	539000	here in Orange County, you guys don't really know some of my background,
539000	541000	I actually play symphonic percussion.
541000	544000	I am in two wind symphonies in the Atlanta area.
544000	547000	I know how to conduct, because I have conducted before.
547000	551000	But you got to realize, and what I was trying to see is, you know,
551000	554000	I know Dance Dance Revolution is not a dancing simulator.
554000	556000	You can't learn how to play guitar with Guitar Hero.
556000	559000	You can't conduct with Wii Orchestra.
559000	562000	It was very hard. I was trying to, you know, use real conducting techniques,
562000	564000	and it's not that good yet.
564000	566000	You do have to treat it like a video game.
566000	569000	It's sometimes too sensitive, sometimes not sensitive enough.
569000	570000	But it was interesting.
570000	575000	What did you learn about the Wii controller today?
575000	578000	That I learned the tech specs of it.
578000	580000	And what are the tech specs of the Wiimote?
580000	581000	Okay.
581000	584000	I don't care what, I'm calling this the Wiimote.
584000	585000	Wiicon.
585000	589000	Dark Sakura says Wiicon, I say Wiimote.
589000	591000	So we're just always going to have this back and forth
591000	593000	until Miyamoto can clear this up.
593000	595000	So, and by the way, Funny Dale, final for long,
595000	598000	was right at the very end of the booth, right before you.
598000	602000	Anyway, here's the thing.
602000	604000	Nintendo kept saying, oh, you know, making you think
604000	606000	that it was kind of like a 3D mouse.
606000	608000	It would be able to tell where it was in 3D space.
608000	610000	You know, you'd be able to put the controller on the floor,
610000	611000	and know it was on the floor.
611000	613000	No, it's not like that.
613000	617000	It's accelerometers and an IR infrared blaster,
617000	620000	just like your TV's remote control.
620000	622000	So a lot of things, like, people were saying,
622000	624000	oh, it's so sensitive, you know,
624000	626000	when they were playing, like, the Duck Hunt thing.
626000	628000	It's an IR, and the receiver is that little sensor
628000	631000	that has double-stick tape that you put under your TV.
631000	633000	So the farther away you are from your TV,
633000	635000	the less sensitive it is.
635000	637000	That's how you fix the sensitivity.
637000	639000	Since we were two feet away from the screen,
639000	641000	it was very, very, very sensitive.
641000	643000	Well, also, the thing is, they're going to be adjusting
643000	646000	the sensitivity, and you're going to have an adjustment
646000	650000	very similar to, like, a calibrating a mouse sensitivity.
650000	652000	Right, but I mean, what I'm saying is, like,
652000	653000	we could, like, step back another foot,
653000	655000	and that would adjust the sensitivity as well.
655000	657000	And they're not telling people that.
657000	660000	They're trying to say it's some, like, revolutionary technology.
660000	661000	Tell me more about the sensor.
661000	663000	You said it's just a little piece of tape, practically?
663000	665000	Yeah, it's a little piece, well, no, it's not really tape.
665000	666000	It's got double-stick tape.
666000	668000	That's how it attaches to your TV.
668000	671000	But you can put it on a table as long, you know,
671000	673000	because some people were asking, you know,
673000	676000	okay, I have a projector, and I project on my wall.
676000	678000	And they're like, well, you know, you should mount it to the wall
678000	682000	underneath where your screen is or something and stuff.
682000	684000	But it's not used in every game.
684000	687000	Only in the games that actually use the IR sensor,
687000	690000	which Excite Truck is not one of.
690000	692000	That only used the accelerometers in it.
692000	693000	Very interesting.
693000	696000	So, you know, some games don't even need that sensor.
696000	698000	You can take that sensor away and still play Excite Truck.
698000	699000	All right.
699000	700000	That's very interesting.
700000	702000	I think Bobby's going to win round one of three interesting things,
702000	704000	because that was very interesting.
704000	705000	All right.
705000	706000	Well, here's mine.
706000	709000	My interesting thing I saw was Luminous 2.
709000	713000	I went and saw Luminous 2, which was being shown at one of Mr. Games.
713000	716000	You know why Luminous 2 is interesting?
716000	718000	I didn't see any damn difference from Luminous 1.
718000	721000	Not a damn thing was different from Luminous 1.
721000	723000	Okay, some of the themes were different,
723000	726000	and it seemed to have more video in the background,
726000	728000	and they changed the look.
728000	734000	I was surprised, because Luminous Live on Xbox looks a lot like Luminous 2.
734000	737000	As for new modes, whatever else, it wasn't in the demo,
737000	740000	so I couldn't tell you, and nobody at the booth told me anything extra.
740000	743000	So as far as I know, if you have Luminous,
743000	745000	there's really no need to get Luminous 2.
745000	747000	I imagine they'll announce other things later,
747000	749000	but they're not in the demo.
749000	750000	I started the demo from scratch.
750000	751000	It takes you right in the game.
751000	753000	In fact, some of the music was the same.
753000	756000	Yeah, some of the music and themes were the exact same.
756000	758000	Not a good demo in my opinion.
758000	760000	I was very disappointed in Luminous 2.
760000	763000	However, the surprise of Luminous on Xbox Live,
763000	765000	which I actually played today,
765000	768000	complete with the Madonna video and everything,
768000	772000	was a great experience, because it's nice to play it on a huge TV and all that stuff.
772000	774000	So that's one of mine.
774000	777000	Dark Sakura, you got a second interesting thing for us?
777000	778000	Star Trek Legacy.
778000	781000	Ah, yes. Now this is the show that made us late.
781000	787000	Yeah, we had a meeting with Bethesda to see their demo for that.
787000	791000	That was pretty sick.
791000	796000	You basically can pick from any generation of the Star Trek universe,
796000	799000	with the exception of, I think, Enterprise.
799000	802000	No, Enterprise is in there all five generations.
802000	804000	No, Enterprise was not there.
804000	806000	As in the series Enterprise.
806000	808000	Yeah, the series Enterprise, not the ship.
808000	812000	No, according to the trailer that they had, it included Enterprise.
812000	813000	They didn't show it in the demo.
813000	816000	According to them, they had original series,
816000	820000	they had Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager.
820000	821000	That was it.
821000	822000	Well, not according to their trailer.
822000	825000	Okay, I feel like I'm in the movie Trekkies right now. What else?
825000	827000	Well, according to their rep, that's what I said.
827000	828000	Alright.
828000	835000	Anyway, you can also play as Romulans, you can play as Klingons,
835000	838000	you can play as the Borg, which I thought was pretty cool.
838000	840000	And you can assimilate people.
840000	841000	That's cool.
841000	842000	Only in the multiplayer.
842000	843000	Only multiplayer.
843000	844000	The single player is all...
844000	845000	It's all Federation.
845000	847000	Yeah, Federation.
847000	853000	It was, they actually, on the demo, they recreated the battle from The Wrath of Khan.
853000	854000	That was pretty awesome.
854000	856000	This game is a Trekkies wet dream.
856000	857000	Oh, yeah.
857000	858000	They went all out.
858000	863000	They have everything nailed down, like the ship specs, the, you know,
863000	865000	like you say, the recreation of certain scenarios.
865000	869000	And, you know, if you're into Star Trek, you're gonna think it's great.
869000	870000	And...
870000	872000	You have full range of motion in that game.
872000	876000	On top of that, if you are a little bit iffy on direction,
876000	880000	you can even go to a strategic map mode, select where you want to go,
880000	881000	and it'll just go there.
881000	883000	You can even play the whole game in strategic map mode,
883000	884000	but it's a little eh.
884000	887000	It's like more for, okay, I want to go here, and then I'm gonna fight.
887000	890000	It's definitely a tactical ship game, too.
890000	892000	I actually thought when we were going in there,
892000	894000	I thought we were gonna see the Star Trek MMO,
894000	896000	which is nowhere to be seen.
896000	898000	I guess it's still in early development.
898000	901000	But I was, I'm a casual Trekkie.
901000	902000	Like, I like Star Trek.
902000	903000	It's cool.
903000	906000	I don't like it now that it's on G4, but I'll watch it other places.
906000	909000	But it's a good show.
909000	910000	You know, it's fun.
910000	912000	And a lot of, you know, high school memories and stuff.
912000	919000	But it's definitely complete, like, very complete for the Star Trek hardcore fan.
919000	921000	I mean, they went to all these resources.
921000	923000	And even for the casual Trek fan,
923000	926000	it's gonna have tutorial modes that ease you into it
926000	928000	and easy scenarios type situations.
928000	930000	And it's very pretty to look at.
930000	932000	I mean, it's a pretty, pretty game.
932000	936000	So I was very impressed with Star Trek Legacy.
936000	937000	Thumbs up.
937000	938000	Yes.
938000	939000	All right.
939000	941000	Loki, one interesting thing.
941000	945000	I got to play more of the PlayStation 2 today.
945000	947000	The interesting part...
947000	949000	Why don't you come over to my house and play PlayStation 2?
949000	950000	You mean PlayStation 3?
950000	951000	PlayStation 3.
951000	952000	I played both today.
952000	953000	All right.
953000	954000	I got it only.
954000	959000	No, PlayStation 3 actually played two different games.
959000	961000	And here's the thing.
961000	966000	The surprising thing is I'm not impressed by the PlayStation 3 at all.
966000	969000	And I played one of the games I've been looking forward to
969000	972000	ever since I saw the video MotorStorm.
972000	975000	What the hell?
975000	977000	I mean, it's completely...
977000	979000	It's just an average game.
979000	980000	So what?
980000	981000	Oh, goody.
981000	982000	You got the mud effects right.
982000	985000	Doesn't make it any better of an off-road game.
985000	986000	Okay.
986000	989000	What did you like about the movie that you saw?
989000	990000	What I liked about the movie,
990000	994000	the movie made it seem like it's gonna be burnout off-road type of thing.
994000	997000	Really fast, really crazy-ass gameplay
997000	1001000	where cars are just crashing and flipping all over the place and exploding.
1001000	1003000	Fire, just lots of stuff like that.
1003000	1004000	And what was the reality of the demo?
1004000	1007000	The reality of the demo was it was just an off-road game.
1007000	1010000	Cars seemed to be driving extremely slow.
1010000	1013000	In fact, a lot of times you'd fall off a cliff or whatever.
1013000	1016000	If you did happen to crash, it would do a slow-mo instant replay of it,
1016000	1018000	and it was very unimpressive.
1018000	1023000	Especially for a next-gen game, I see better crashes and burnout.
1023000	1028000	And I'm talking about, you know, even I think before burnout,
1028000	1030000	it's really sad.
1030000	1033000	Burnout PlayStation 2 has better crashes than this game.
1033000	1037000	What else did you check out on PlayStation 3?
1037000	1043000	I checked out Gran Turismo HD and also not impressed by it at all.
1043000	1045000	With the paper people?
1045000	1046000	Yeah, the paper people.
1046000	1047000	They're back.
1047000	1048000	In high def.
1048000	1050000	It's not necessarily the paper people.
1050000	1053000	They're actually kind of 3D, but they don't move.
1053000	1055000	They're just kind of stationary.
1055000	1057000	In the Grand Canyon level, they do move.
1057000	1058000	Yeah, a little bit.
1058000	1059000	But here's the thing.
1059000	1062000	If you drive past them, they're still looking behind you down the track
1062000	1064000	like something's going to happen.
1064000	1065000	Well, let's give them a break, though.
1065000	1066000	It's an early, early build.
1066000	1069000	That all might still change, you know?
1069000	1070000	It's pretty.
1070000	1071000	I'll give it that.
1071000	1073000	They're not the only game that uses paper people.
1073000	1076000	I mean, let's look at MotoGP 2006.
1076000	1077000	I played that today also.
1077000	1078000	Same problem.
1078000	1082000	The whole thing is it's not impressive enough to get me to spend more money.
1082000	1085000	This thing has got to be leaps and bounds better than the 360
1085000	1087000	in order for me to spend that kind of money.
1087000	1091000	I'm really not seeing anything really unique and revolutionary
1091000	1093000	coming out for anything on the PlayStation 3.
1093000	1097000	It's all just more of the same crap, just prettier.
1097000	1099000	I did notice, though, that Sonic the Hedgehog
1099000	1104000	and there's a few other games, I think, that were on both platforms
1104000	1107000	looked a little better on the PlayStation 3.
1107000	1109000	The Sonic looked a little bit better.
1109000	1116000	Was it Mobile Suit Gundam looked extremely better than the 360 version?
1116000	1118000	I don't know if it's the monitors that they're playing on,
1118000	1121000	but it looked like night and day for that.
1121000	1126000	Pretty graphics can't make me forgive the botch job done on Sonic.
1126000	1129000	All right, Bobby, how's Chat Room doing?
1129000	1131000	They're doing fine.
1131000	1133000	They're pitching about G4 right now, actually.
1133000	1136000	They're asking if we went by G4's booth and what was going on.
1136000	1138000	I have avoided it at all costs.
1138000	1141000	I heard a bunch of monkeys outside the booth today going,
1141000	1143000	Ah! Oh, my God!
1143000	1145000	And just didn't care.
1145000	1147000	What were they cheering for?
1147000	1149000	Attack of the Show, I think, was live from E3.
1149000	1150000	Hi, Mom, I'm on TV.
1150000	1152000	Oh, Kevin Pereira, what the fuck you did?
1152000	1154000	Ah, love you, ah!
1154000	1155000	Yeah, pretty much.
1155000	1157000	Yeah, no, not for me.
1157000	1159000	I kept running into them today.
1159000	1162000	They had booth babes doing weird things.
1162000	1164000	Now, you brought this up when we were walking around
1164000	1168000	that there was not a swarm of G4 people like there was in years past.
1168000	1170000	That's because they're not a gaming channel again.
1170000	1173000	Well, right, I know. They're off getting guys.
1173000	1174000	Yeah.
1174000	1176000	Did they get you?
1176000	1178000	No, that's their slogan. We get guys.
1178000	1179000	They're off getting guys.
1179000	1181000	That's why I'm asking you. Did they get you?
1181000	1182000	Uh-huh.
1182000	1183000	Did they get you?
1183000	1184000	No.
1184000	1185000	Okay, good.
1185000	1186000	No, they don't have me.
1186000	1187000	I hid from them.
1187000	1188000	Here's the thing, though.
1188000	1189000	You're not a guy.
1189000	1193000	I see swarms of GameTap shirts, which is okay because I like GameTap.
1193000	1194000	Right.
1194000	1196000	But I was surprised at that.
1196000	1199000	I don't think they're working for GameTap.
1199000	1201000	Was GameTap giving away something to shirt holders?
1201000	1203000	They were giving away shirts.
1203000	1205000	I missed that one out.
1205000	1208000	Well, yeah, but you don't wear your shirts that you win the next day.
1208000	1209000	The shirts I get...
1209000	1210000	Some people...
1210000	1211000	Some people...
1211000	1212000	Oh, okay.
1212000	1213000	Look at that right here.
1213000	1214000	Sorry.
1214000	1215000	He's a freak.
1215000	1216000	Okay.
1216000	1220000	The shirts I get at E3, I wear to the gym, which isn't very often,
1220000	1222000	but that's where they get used.
1222000	1225000	That's my wardrobe is all my E3 shirts, and I haven't gotten a single one this year.
1225000	1226000	I know.
1226000	1229000	So I'm going to be naked next week, and I'm a fat man, so that's not a good thing.
1229000	1230000	Cheap.
1230000	1231000	Cheap.
1231000	1232000	No, very disappointing swag this year.
1232000	1233000	You know why?
1233000	1235000	Everybody's shit is online.
1235000	1237000	Well, I don't know.
1237000	1240000	I pretty much hoard myself out to Namco for tokens.
1240000	1243000	Okay, but you may have gotten some shit, and I've gotten some closer.
1243000	1245000	I have slime keychains.
1245000	1248000	But is it as good as it was two years ago with the swag?
1248000	1249000	I say no.
1249000	1250000	No.
1250000	1251000	No.
1251000	1252000	No.
1252000	1255000	But I got slime keychains.
1255000	1257000	The swag goes down every year.
1257000	1262000	This is my tenth E3, and I have actually noticed every single year I get less and less and
1262000	1263000	less swag.
1263000	1264000	It goes down every year.
1264000	1265000	Because they're getting cheap.
1265000	1266000	Yep.
1266000	1267000	Everything's awesome.
1267000	1269000	I got a clock from the Korean people.
1269000	1272000	Pretty soon E3 is going to be online.
1272000	1274000	That's fine, though, because I hate traffic here.
1274000	1277000	I wish they'd moved E3 to Vegas or somewhere that's built to hold a convention.
1277000	1278000	I think they should bring it back to Atlanta.
1278000	1280000	I loved it when it was in Atlanta.
1280000	1282000	Yeah, but you have selfish reasons for that.
1282000	1285000	I actually wouldn't mind going to Atlanta.
1285000	1286000	I wouldn't mind either.
1286000	1287000	I'm sure it's a great place.
1287000	1290000	Because then I can go to E3 and drive back to Mobile and hang out with my family and
1290000	1291000	then play home.
1291000	1292000	I don't think you're right.
1292000	1295000	Dear ESA, please have E3 in Mr. Blackwell's backyard.
1295000	1296000	Yes.
1296000	1297000	All right.
1297000	1300000	Speaking of Bobby, one interesting thing.
1300000	1301000	Another one.
1301000	1302000	Number two.
1302000	1303000	Yeah, another one.
1303000	1306000	One thing, since more Wii, since apparently I played the Wii all day today.
1306000	1308000	You played with your Wii all day long.
1308000	1309000	I played with my Wii.
1309000	1310000	And here's the thing.
1310000	1317000	A lot of people are actually wondering about, and this is more about the IR games.
1317000	1320000	They're like, oh, my arm's going to get tired when I play these games all that much.
1320000	1322000	Your arm gets tired after you play with your Wii too long.
1322000	1323000	Exactly.
1323000	1324000	Okay.
1324000	1326000	Well, there is a way to play with your Wii without moving your arm.
1326000	1328000	You really only need very...
1328000	1333000	I was holding the controller in the same position that I would hold a PS2 controller.
1333000	1341000	Because I've been doing very slight movements with my wrist, so you don't have to worry about every single game making you do sweeping motions.
1341000	1348000	Now, yes, WarioWare does make you do hula hoops and squats and stuff like that.
1348000	1351000	But not all the games are going to really tire you out.
1351000	1359000	And so I thought that was kind of interesting, you know, how natural I could actually be laying on the couch and playing some of these games.
1359000	1362000	I think there actually need to be more games that wear people out.
1362000	1364000	Well, WarioWare's a good start.
1364000	1366000	And then maybe that horse racing game...
1366000	1368000	Final Furlong?
1368000	1370000	Dark Sakura wants Wii Torture Chamber.
1370000	1372000	No, I don't want Wii Torture Chamber.
1372000	1377000	I want, like, Wii Robics and, like, Wii Boot Camp.
1377000	1379000	Wii Boot Camp sounds better.
1379000	1380000	Wii Boot Camp.
1380000	1382000	Because I think about Dance Aerobics and, like...
1382000	1386000	They can fully bring back Dance Aerobics on the Wii.
1386000	1387000	No.
1387000	1388000	Wii!
1388000	1390000	Hook up a DDR mat and then have the controller.
1390000	1391000	There you go.
1391000	1394000	Well, that's pretty much the same thing with the eye toy and...
1394000	1395000	It's something...
1395000	1397000	Yeah, but this is by Nintendo, so it'll be better.
1397000	1398000	So it'll be awesome.
1398000	1399000	You know it and I know it.
1399000	1402000	If they brought out a new Dance Aerobics, you'd play it once and that would be it.
1402000	1403000	No.
1403000	1404000	That's me.
1404000	1405000	I wouldn't.
1405000	1406000	Anyway.
1406000	1409000	My second interesting thing I saw today would be the...
1409000	1411000	Eye of Judgment.
1411000	1413000	Did you make your judgment on it?
1413000	1415000	I did make a judgment on it.
1415000	1419000	What a waste of fucking space at the PlayStation 3 booth.
1419000	1422000	What a waste of fucking space.
1422000	1426000	And I'm sorry to the guys that developed this because I'm sure they worked very hard on
1426000	1430000	this, but now is not the time to be showing me the Eye of Judgment.
1430000	1434000	The Eye of Judgment could have been done on the PS2.
1434000	1435000	I...
1435000	1436000	From my perspective...
1436000	1439000	Now, granted, I don't know any tech stuff about PS3.
1439000	1441000	The Eye of Judgment...
1441000	1444000	For those that don't know what the Eye of Judgment is, it's that thing they showed at
1444000	1449000	the conference where you put the card down and whoosh, a monster comes onto the screen.
1449000	1450000	It looked like Yu-Gi-Oh.
1450000	1454000	I guess it's supposed to be a game, but the people admitted that it wasn't really a game
1454000	1456000	but more like a tech demo.
1456000	1457000	I don't know.
1457000	1458000	Loki, you saw the Eye of Judgment.
1458000	1459000	What was your thoughts?
1459000	1460000	Well, here's the thing.
1460000	1465000	When basically you have to put down a card and the eye toy, or it wasn't really an eye
1465000	1470000	toy, it was just a camera, would recognize these barcode light things on top and bottom
1470000	1474000	of the card, and there's also like four triangles on it to kind of orient the card so it knows
1474000	1477000	which direction it's facing because that's important.
1477000	1481000	So, basically, it will spawn whatever monster based on what card it is.
1481000	1484000	Now, here's the thing that really kind of bugged me about it.
1484000	1489000	You can cast spells on your monsters as well, but the spell card is put on top of the monster
1489000	1493000	card, and you have to remember to take the card off after the spell is cast, otherwise
1493000	1496000	it casts again because it's stupid.
1496000	1501000	And also, if you're playing the game and happen to destroy a monster, you have to remember
1501000	1505000	to take it off the board, otherwise it spawns the monster again because it's stupid.
1505000	1508000	Yeah, the Eye of Judgment has an IQ of about three.
1508000	1511000	Here's the other thing that the geniuses...
1511000	1512000	They need a brain of judgment.
1512000	1515000	Here's the geniuses that Sony didn't think about.
1515000	1519000	Okay, this game uses actual cards like magic cards or something like that.
1519000	1522000	Well, if you're actually going to be playing this game, they're playing on selling expansion
1522000	1523000	packs later on.
1523000	1525000	Here's the only problem here.
1525000	1529000	You can probably scan those cards and print them back out again, and there you go.
1529000	1533000	You have two cards because the camera's not going to know the difference between a fake
1533000	1535000	and a real card.
1535000	1539000	Okay, Bobby, who are those Cats and Ken show we saw the first day that are here tonight?
1539000	1540000	Novint Falcon.
1540000	1541000	Okay, Novint.
1541000	1543000	N-O-V-I-N-T.
1543000	1546000	Describe Novint for the listeners real quick, and there's a reason I'm doing this.
1546000	1552000	Okay, Novint Falcon, basically what it is, it's a PC peripheral, and it takes USB, and
1552000	1558000	essentially it has touch sensitive, so it's a little ball, and I will link it in chat
1558000	1561000	because I've got to go find it on Google, and I'll put the link in chat.
1561000	1564000	I think it's novint.com slash falcon.htm or something like that.
1564000	1571000	And you put your fingers on this little ball, and say there is a ball on the screen.
1571000	1574000	You actually push forward, and it will stop at the ball, and you can actually trace around
1574000	1580000	the ball, and then if they have ridges on it, you can actually feel the ridges as you
1580000	1585000	touch the ball, or like, if you have like balls, you can have a rubber band, and it
1585000	1587000	will actually pull you around.
1587000	1590000	You can feel your balls, like they're right there in your hand.
1590000	1592000	So we have gone from the Wii to the balls.
1592000	1594000	Alright, no, but seriously though, okay.
1594000	1595000	Explicit tag, here we come.
1595000	1597000	These are all, yeah, I think we have to explicit this show.
1597000	1604000	Um, look, um, the point is that these are all tech demos, but this, they also have,
1604000	1605000	what was it, Half-Life they were showing?
1605000	1608000	They had Half-Life 2 and something else, and they are here tonight.
1608000	1610000	Yeah, now here's the thing.
1610000	1613000	That, I went and played that, and I thought, this is great.
1613000	1615000	Why isn't this on a console?
1615000	1619000	That is what Sony should be having in their little rooms right now.
1619000	1624000	The Eye of Judgment is, it is not time for the Eye of Judgment, okay.
1624000	1629000	That, I would have been far more impressed if Sony had teamed up with those Novant guys
1629000	1631000	and were showing that thing.
1631000	1635000	It's not a smart name to be calling that either, the Eye of Judgment.
1635000	1637000	I judge this crap.
1637000	1640000	All right.
1640000	1643000	It is Novant.com slash Falcon dot HTML.
1643000	1645000	All right, we gotta keep things moving.
1645000	1648000	If you guys are listening live, gamer Andy will be out momentarily.
1648000	1649000	I'm looking right at him, he's sitting there.
1649000	1651000	Hi, gamer Andy, how you doing?
1651000	1654000	Uh, and we're starting to butt into his time a little bit.
1654000	1655000	Yeah, that's fine, that's fine.
1655000	1656000	Okay, good.
1656000	1658000	Yeah, I see him chowing down on a sandwich, so I'll wait till he's finished.
1658000	1659000	Then we'll get out of here.
1659000	1661000	They spent an hour and a half in L.A. traffic.
1661000	1662000	Oh, well, poor bastards.
1662000	1666000	All right, so, yeah, those of you guys listening live, you'll hear him next,
1666000	1668000	but if you miss it for whatever reason,
1668000	1671000	they've got their podcast over at gamerandy.com.
1671000	1672000	Check it out, it's rad.
1672000	1678000	All right, one other thing you thought was interesting today, Dark Sakura.
1678000	1681000	Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins on PSP.
1681000	1683000	It was purdy.
1683000	1686000	Now, this is not the same as the Capcom Classics thing
1686000	1688000	that also has Ghosts and Goblins, right?
1688000	1690000	This is an all-new Ghosts and Goblins game.
1690000	1693000	What's so funky new about it?
1693000	1697000	You don't get golden armor, you get, like, blue pimp armor or something.
1697000	1700000	And, like, one of the enemies in the new one is these hands
1700000	1702000	that reach out of the ground and grab you
1702000	1704000	and then, like, throw you into a vat of acid
1704000	1707000	or, like, bang you into the ground.
1707000	1709000	And, like, the spitting plants were still there.
1709000	1713000	The little ghosty things were still there.
1713000	1717000	I didn't see the vampire in a box from the old ones.
1717000	1721000	You could still shoot the vases.
1721000	1724000	They're still there. Or urns, I guess, are more accurate.
1724000	1727000	I did go on one of the bosses.
1727000	1729000	There's actually new weapons.
1729000	1731000	And you have a refillable life bar.
1731000	1735000	But when that's out, then you turn into the, you know, naked guy.
1735000	1737000	Oh, that's cool.
1737000	1740000	That seems to help the difficulty a little bit, I think.
1740000	1743000	I actually avoided them at first because I thought they were the holy water
1743000	1744000	and the holy water sucks.
1744000	1746000	One of your weapons is a crossbow.
1746000	1749000	You also have little bombs.
1749000	1752000	You can get, you know, you start off with the lances, of course,
1752000	1755000	which I still think are the better weapons.
1755000	1760000	You also get, like, a vine whip, which really sucks ass.
1760000	1762000	Another cool thing about that that just made me laugh,
1762000	1767000	I actually took a little bit of video of this, sort of stealthily,
1767000	1775000	is one of the cursed forms that he can get is as a woman.
1775000	1777000	Which I would think that would be a blessing.
1777000	1779000	What a curse indeed.
1779000	1783000	Hey, hey, it actually made the boss fight better because she is, like,
1783000	1790000	in this big, she looks very peasant German, you know,
1790000	1796000	like you see in the old history books, in a big dress.
1796000	1799000	And she'd sort of float in the air, sort of like Princess Peach,
1799000	1801000	which was cool because you could still attack.
1801000	1804000	She would just move slower, like a really huge woman.
1804000	1806000	But you throw attacks while you're floating in the air
1806000	1808000	and you can still hit the boss.
1808000	1810000	It actually ended up being more convenient,
1810000	1813000	but of course when you get hit, you lose the form again.
1813000	1817000	But I enjoyed it immensely. The music was still good.
1817000	1823000	It was also right next to Tekken, so I was going between the two for a while.
1823000	1827000	But, you know, I actually wasn't too sure about it at first
1827000	1830000	until I talked to Dan on the phone yesterday.
1830000	1833000	He's like, you were going to go play Ultimate Ghost of Goblins.
1833000	1836000	I was like, okay. So I did and I had a good time.
1836000	1838000	It was pretty fun.
1838000	1841000	I was when I was hanging out with Julie, custom E19,
1841000	1843000	who she was over there playing Ace Combat.
1843000	1845000	She's like, I don't like this game.
1845000	1847000	I was like, go play Ghost of Goblins.
1847000	1852000	She's like, no. But no, it was great. It was fantastic.
1852000	1854000	Loki.
1854000	1858000	Actually the surprising game that I saw today was this game
1858000	1862000	that probably from a company no one's ever heard of.
1862000	1865000	It's actually by this group called On Games,
1865000	1868000	and the game was called Wild Summer.
1868000	1872000	Now, basically this game is like a sandbox game,
1872000	1874000	very similar to Granth and Auto,
1874000	1878000	but it's basically like kind of a plot line to American Pie.
1878000	1885000	You're this trouble-starting teenager with hormones raging.
1885000	1888000	Loki, tell them why we went to look at this game.
1888000	1890000	Because I saw the game and I'm like, ooh, I got to go play that
1890000	1892000	because it looked like Leisure Suit Larry.
1892000	1896000	Well, I know I saw the poster and it showed this teenage boy
1896000	1898000	that was stealing panties off a clothes line,
1898000	1901000	and I was like, I have to see whatever that fucking game is.
1901000	1904000	That looks too unreal to be true.
1904000	1908000	So anyways, it looks amazing so far.
1908000	1910000	They still have about a year and a half of development left
1910000	1913000	that's supposed to be coming out in fall of 2007.
1913000	1915000	But the thing is, it's going to be,
1915000	1917000	they've got like a ton of different stuff in here.
1917000	1920000	One of the things that they were showing was the kind of,
1920000	1926000	oh, what was it, like the free-running type of stuff in there.
1926000	1928000	So you're jumping from buildings and stuff.
1928000	1931000	You kind of have the same Prince of Persia gameplay.
1931000	1935000	It also has a bunch of mini-games, including like dancing,
1935000	1937000	playing beach volleyball.
1937000	1941000	But they have a dating part in it too, kind of like a dating sim.
1941000	1944000	And the way the dating sim is, it's going to be playing Magic the Gathering.
1944000	1947000	You're actually going to have like cards for, you know,
1947000	1949000	pretend you're interested in their conversation, you know,
1949000	1952000	get her drunk, stuff like that.
1952000	1954000	It's a very ambitious game.
1954000	1956000	It sounds like there's a lot they want to do with it.
1956000	1958000	But I was really impressed with the guy,
1958000	1962000	and they were very nice to us too.
1962000	1965000	It looked like they've gone into a lot of detail.
1965000	1967000	They've really thought out about what they want to do,
1967000	1970000	like what their dream game is, and they're going and doing it.
1970000	1973000	And I asked this question, and Jamie, you might appreciate this.
1973000	1974000	I don't know.
1974000	1977000	I said, why would a woman ever want to play this game?
1977000	1980000	Essentially, I said, what is in this for a woman?
1980000	1983000	And basically what they said is that we have women on staff
1983000	1985000	helping us write this game.
1985000	1987000	We're not out to make a tacky game.
1987000	1990000	Leisure Suit Larry is now a tacky franchise now.
1990000	1993000	We're out to make a fun game, you know.
1993000	1996000	That's why there's no nudity in this game.
1996000	1997000	Sorry, guys.
1997000	1998000	There's no nudity.
1998000	2000000	There's no, like it's not perverted.
2000000	2004000	It's just silly fun, like the American Pie or Porky's movies,
2004000	2005000	those types of things.
2005000	2007000	It's just a little bit of dumb fun.
2007000	2010000	So they think that women might want to play it just because it's silly.
2010000	2013000	It's not meant to be a serious game.
2013000	2014000	That was interesting.
2014000	2015000	I'm not interested.
2015000	2017000	Really?
2017000	2018000	Take a look.
2018000	2019000	I walked by it.
2019000	2020000	No, I was over there.
2020000	2021000	I'm not interested.
2021000	2022000	What turned you on?
2022000	2027000	I don't see what fun it is to play a hormonal 16-year-old.
2027000	2030000	Well, you haven't been a hormonal 16-year-old boy.
2030000	2031000	Exactly.
2031000	2032000	I have no interest in it.
2032000	2034000	There's nothing that links it to me.
2034000	2039000	I was spending my 16-year-old kicking off the horny 16-year-old boys.
2039000	2040000	That's all right.
2040000	2042000	They still have Desperate Housewives out there.
2042000	2043000	You know what?
2043000	2044000	Shut up.
2044000	2046000	Desperate Housewives will teach you how to cook and gossip.
2046000	2047000	I was surprised.
2047000	2052000	They actually go into extreme detail on cooking in that game.
2052000	2056000	Yeah, it's like you can pick from recipes and all this crap.
2056000	2058000	I don't need a video game to teach me how to cook.
2058000	2063000	I am so glad I'm on the edge of this stage so I can just run down the stairs as quick
2063000	2064000	as possible.
2064000	2065000	We've done this for years.
2065000	2070000	And one of these days, I'm going to combust, and you'll be right next to me.
2070000	2074000	I was actually surprised at how thorough the Desperate Housewives game looked to be.
2074000	2076000	I was actually kind of surprised.
2076000	2081000	It's a really intricate game, but it's stupid.
2081000	2083000	It's a great game, but it's stupid.
2083000	2085000	It's intricate, but it's stupid.
2085000	2086000	Intricately stupid.
2086000	2087000	Yeah.
2087000	2088000	What a waste.
2088000	2089000	What a waste.
2089000	2091000	But Wild Summer, you know what?
2091000	2092000	I think it'll be cute.
2092000	2093000	I want to see it.
2093000	2095000	They're working on getting it on the 360.
2095000	2100000	And to be honest, there's nothing like it out there, especially on the 360.
2100000	2103000	And they had other games, too, that looked pretty good.
2103000	2104000	All right.
2104000	2105000	We've got to keep it moving, guys.
2105000	2108000	Bobby, one more interesting thing from today.
2108000	2112000	Going for the Wii trifecta because I just can't stop talking about my Wii.
2112000	2113000	Oh, wouldn't that be a Triforce?
2113000	2114000	Bobby, a Triforce.
2114000	2118000	Oh, wow.
2118000	2119000	We'll be here till Friday.
2119000	2120000	Thank you.
2120000	2125000	The virtual console, they actually had two demo units running of the virtual console
2125000	2129000	with that new controller that they were showing that looks like a Super Nintendo controller
2129000	2131000	with dual analog sticks.
2131000	2132000	Cool.
2132000	2135000	And it's a very light controller, very comfortable to me.
2135000	2137000	They had five games running.
2137000	2139000	They had one for each system, pretty much.
2139000	2142000	They had Super Mario Brothers on the NES, Super Mario World on the SNES,
2142000	2145000	Super Mario 64 on the N64, Sonic the Hedgehog on Genesis,
2145000	2148000	and Bonk's Adventure on the TurboGrafx.
2148000	2151000	Did they show anything about how the games would be bought or anything,
2151000	2153000	or was it just title screen go?
2153000	2154000	Just title screen go.
2154000	2155000	That's kind of lame.
2155000	2157000	And Super Mario 64 has some frame rate issues.
2157000	2158000	Ouch.
2158000	2160000	And it's hard to control with that controller.
2160000	2165000	Well, the whole thing, too, is the virtual console wasn't a finished product either.
2165000	2168000	This is a concept right now.
2168000	2170000	They haven't even worked out the details.
2170000	2174000	Yes, the SNES and the Genesis games worked really well.
2174000	2176000	I mean, it felt good.
2176000	2177000	Then I'll back off.
2177000	2181000	The thing is, though, I haven't played a TurboGrafx in so long.
2181000	2183000	I believe that Bonk's worked really well.
2183000	2185000	I mean, it looked fine to me.
2185000	2186000	I didn't notice any glitches or anything,
2186000	2189000	but I can't compare it to the original TurboGrafx.
2189000	2191000	Did it tell you to press run?
2191000	2192000	I didn't look.
2192000	2195000	I did love how sharp the games looked.
2195000	2196000	Yeah.
2196000	2197000	It was so high res.
2197000	2199000	I mean, it's pillar boxed, but it's still high.
2199000	2200000	Yeah.
2200000	2201000	It's still pixelated.
2201000	2203000	Maybe they up-coded it somehow or something.
2203000	2205000	Yeah, they had to up-convert it probably to 480p.
2205000	2206000	Well, that's cool.
2206000	2207000	Hey, hats off there.
2207000	2210000	Actually, I saw Super Mario World yesterday.
2210000	2211000	I thought it looked really clean.
2211000	2212000	Awesome.
2212000	2213000	All right.
2213000	2215000	Chat room question from a while ago.
2215000	2216000	Oh, yes, please.
2216000	2217000	I'm sorry.
2217000	2218000	Sorry, chat room again.
2218000	2220000	I don't have the iBUCS, so we can't look at chat.
2220000	2221000	Jamie and I.
2221000	2222000	But Bobby, what's chat room say?
2222000	2225000	CKY Mike, who thinks I should join you guys full-time, asked what game...
2225000	2227000	You want to move to Sacramento, then we'll talk.
2227000	2228000	Yeah, I'll move to Sacramento.
2228000	2229000	All right.
2229000	2230000	How about that?
2230000	2231000	All right.
2231000	2232000	What game demos did you get to download at the PSP booth?
2232000	2233000	I believe that's a Matt thing.
2233000	2234000	That's a Loki thing.
2234000	2235000	Go for it.
2235000	2236000	Well, let's see.
2236000	2241000	They have the Capcom Classic Collection Reloaded, I guess is what it's called now, and they
2241000	2247000	only really had one stage from that, and that was actually Ghosts and Goblins, I guess.
2247000	2251000	Then they had, let's see, Gangs of London was one of them.
2251000	2254000	They had Lemmings.
2254000	2259000	The one I played, Every Extended Extra.
2259000	2261000	Yeah, Every Extended Extra.
2261000	2262000	E3.
2262000	2264000	And that was okay.
2264000	2267000	They had Ratchet and Clank, Size Matters.
2267000	2268000	I played that for a little bit.
2268000	2269000	That was okay.
2269000	2273000	And then I can't remember the last game was.
2273000	2276000	It wasn't that standout.
2276000	2278000	Every Extended Extra seemed okay to me.
2278000	2279000	It was weird.
2279000	2280000	It was a little weird.
2280000	2284000	It wasn't what I expected from Q Entertainment, but I think it'll be a good time.
2284000	2288000	I like how they re-stamped or reused some of the sound effects from Luminous.
2288000	2290000	Yeah, that was funny.
2290000	2291000	Dark Star?
2291000	2293000	No, I have an honorable mention.
2293000	2295000	Okay, yeah, let's do real quick though.
2295000	2297000	We want to try and start wrapping this up.
2297000	2300000	We are going to take a couple quick phone calls though.
2300000	2302000	Bobby, tell them how to get in.
2302000	2308000	Okay, you can call 1-866-880-0156.
2308000	2309000	Soul-free number in the United States.
2309000	2310000	Some quickies first.
2310000	2311000	Dark Sakura.
2311000	2312000	WTF.
2312000	2315000	The WTF game is amazing.
2315000	2316000	I chopped rabbits in half.
2316000	2318000	It was great.
2318000	2320000	I did the wood chopping game.
2320000	2325000	It basically is a bunch of really, really messed up mini games.
2325000	2329000	And the ones that Julie and I actually played was the wood chopping game
2329000	2330000	where you chop wood for money.
2330000	2334000	Only the thing is that the grandma lady will randomly put out an animal.
2334000	2337000	The chicken sorting game was fantastic because you could do.
2337000	2342000	You sort them as boys, girls, or dead.
2342000	2345000	No, it said heavenly.
2345000	2346000	Because they're dead.
2346000	2347000	That's why they go to heaven.
2347000	2348000	But that's great.
2348000	2349000	And that made me go WTF.
2349000	2350000	It's a great time.
2350000	2351000	All right, we've got to go.
2351000	2352000	It was work time fun.
2352000	2353000	Let's go to the telephone.
2353000	2354000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2354000	2355000	Who's this?
2355000	2357000	Hi, it's Sephiroth1215.
2357000	2359000	Sephiroth1215, what's on your mind?
2359000	2361000	We've got to make it quick tonight.
2361000	2368000	Okay, I was going to say there has been a little bit of an update for the Imani booth.
2368000	2370000	Yeah, there's been a little bit.
2370000	2376000	It said on Imani style that they brought Guitar Freaks, of course the response to Guitar Hero.
2376000	2381000	UDX is there to show the press how cool the game would potentially be.
2381000	2385000	And when they asked about another Beat Mania game for US,
2385000	2389000	it said that it was too early for them to say whether or not it did well or not.
2389000	2392000	I did not hear, you said Guitar Freaks broke?
2392000	2396000	No, Guitar Freaks was a response to Guitar Hero.
2396000	2402000	I think that they had Guitar Freaks and the Imani in there to have people come over to their booth.
2402000	2404000	That was it.
2404000	2410000	I think it was a press attention thing showing, I think they wanted to show, look at our arcade machines.
2410000	2413000	Look at, we are bringing the arcade experience home.
2413000	2418000	But the weird thing about that, I don't understand the logic of Guitar Freaks being there.
2418000	2424000	I still don't, but maybe they want to show, hey, we've been doing this in the arcade for a long time.
2424000	2428000	I'm not one to say why they have that there, if it is a response to Guitar Hero.
2428000	2434000	Or maybe they're like me and seeing how non-innovative Guitar Hero is because it's been out forever in Japan as Guitar Freaks.
2434000	2439000	See, but I disagree because I do think Guitar Hero is innovative, but in a different way than you do.
2439000	2441000	Or you don't, I should say.
2441000	2446000	And what was the other part of that you said that they were reporting, Sephiroth?
2446000	2455000	They said that 2DX was there because they wanted to show the press how cool it would be and the potential that it could have.
2477000	2480000	Nothing wrong with a little attention, right?
2480000	2493000	Well, yeah. But the problem with that is they did say that they don't have any plans for another US sequel because they don't know whether or not it's sold well enough.
2493000	2501000	Now, the problem I have with that is if I look back on DDR, I mean, they went on for a while and probably didn't sell well until maybe at least max.
2501000	2503000	Actually, it did sell pretty well.
2503000	2508000	Maybe that was the nice way of saying we just can't tell you anything right now.
2508000	2514000	I think, honestly, that was the nice way of saying we can't talk about it.
2514000	2516000	I hope so.
2516000	2517000	Alright, we'll hope so too.
2517000	2520000	Sephiroth, we gotta let you go to take another call. Thanks for calling, alright?
2520000	2521000	You're welcome.
2521000	2522000	Alright, thanks.
2522000	2523000	Alright.
2523000	2524000	Oh, we got another one already?
2524000	2526000	Loki, real quick before we answer this.
2526000	2527000	Yes.
2527000	2528000	Oh, I thought you had a comment.
2528000	2529000	Hello?
2529000	2529000	No.
2529000	2530000	Alright, we'll go phone him.
2530000	2532000	Hi! You're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
2532000	2535000	Hey, this is SilentWind96 again.
2535000	2540000	SilentWind96. Nice to meet you last night. Congratulations.
2540000	2542000	Hey, thanks for getting in, guys.
2542000	2545000	No problem. What'd you think of the E3 Outpost?
2545000	2547000	Oh, I loved it. It was a lot of fun.
2547000	2552000	Awesome. If you're in the LA area, come on down. We're right off Santa Monica in 405.
2552000	2556000	What'd you call in about?
2556000	2562000	Just calling to extend my thanks again for letting me hang out with you guys, and I'm on my way home back to Bakersfield.
2562000	2566000	And I gotta be up at 3 o'clock in the morning to go to work.
2566000	2568000	Aw, poor guy.
2568000	2574000	Well, thanks to the call. I'm glad you had a good time. What was something fun you did while you were here?
2574000	2588000	Well, at the Outpost, I was able to talk to some of the guys from Intellivision and check out the demo for Lost Planet, which was awesome.
2588000	2589000	Yeah.
2589000	2596000	And sat there and watched Bobby Platt, the security desk, kicked into UNO by the computer.
2596000	2602000	That's right. Now, SilentWind96 brought us the full version of UNO for us to take a look at.
2602000	2603000	And I love him for it.
2603000	2605000	What did you guys think of UNO?
2605000	2614000	Well, I had a little bit to drink. A little. And I was sitting back going, UNO. So, yeah.
2614000	2619000	It was UNO. I had four Astra Smashes.
2619000	2620000	Black Wolf?
2620000	2621000	What UNO?
2621000	2622000	UNO.
2622000	2625000	The computer is a cheese monkey.
2625000	2629000	The computer is a bitch. I'm sorry. The computer is evil.
2629000	2630000	Dark Star?
2630000	2632000	Yeah, go ahead.
2632000	2639000	There are always pennies. I think he went four plays without even touching the controller.
2639000	2640000	That would be the first.
2640000	2642000	You got dicked last night.
2642000	2643000	The computer cheats.
2643000	2644000	Yeah.
2644000	2648000	Yeah. It's just a matter of fact. The computer always cheats.
2648000	2651000	Dark Soccer and I were having an interesting conversation in the bus.
2651000	2656000	Why play UNO online when you can get a deck of cards and play with your friends?
2656000	2659000	Because then I couldn't play UNO with Skye.
2659000	2660000	Aww.
2660000	2661000	That makes me warm and fuzzy.
2661000	2663000	That makes me warm and fuzzy and kind of ill.
2663000	2665000	No, I'm just kidding. I'm kidding.
2665000	2669000	All right. No, that was my thought, too.
2669000	2672000	I'm going to have to get my own gamertag now.
2672000	2673000	You should.
2673000	2674000	Yeah.
2674000	2677000	Silent Wind, any other thoughts for our listeners?
2677000	2681000	No, just if you ever get a chance to go down there, that's a great place to hang out.
2681000	2687000	The staff is awesome and Lawrence and Skye were really accommodating.
2687000	2694000	It's good to put a face on the voice that you hear all the time.
2694000	2699000	I finally found an iPod and that's all I got here is a podcast from all you guys.
2699000	2703000	I appreciate your support. You're a true buddy.
2703000	2705000	And what do you think of the set here?
2705000	2706000	I love this set.
2706000	2710000	Silent Wind, what did you think of the set?
2710000	2713000	Oh, I love the NES. The NES set was awesome.
2713000	2715000	I did take pictures with Skye's camera.
2715000	2718000	Oh, good. We'll get those up on the site. Thank you.
2718000	2720000	All right. Silent Wind, we've got to let you go because we're going to get more calls.
2720000	2722000	Thanks for calling in, all right?
2722000	2723000	All right. You take care now.
2723000	2724000	All right. You too, buddy.
2724000	2725000	It's good to meet you.
2725000	2729000	All right. That was Silent Wind, our random contest winner from last night.
2729000	2733000	You have to come down here and be on the E3 Outpost.
2733000	2736000	Check it out here.
2736000	2739000	Bobby, remind the kids how to call in if they want. We'll do a couple more.
2739000	2747000	Toll-free number in the United States, 1-866-880-0156.
2747000	2751000	I wanted to mention another cool game I played was Hot Pixel.
2751000	2752000	That game was awesome.
2752000	2758000	It's just basically WarioWare on the PSP with old retro Atari games in there as well.
2758000	2759000	Freaking awesome.
2759000	2762000	Lots of good WarioWare-type games coming to the PSP.
2762000	2764000	You mean Atari was showing more than one game?
2764000	2765000	Yeah.
2765000	2767000	Wow.
2767000	2768000	Hot Pixel?
2768000	2769000	Hot Pixel.
2769000	2770000	It's fun.
2770000	2774000	And the guy, I guess, who made it or whatever is some crazy-ass French guy.
2774000	2779000	I mean, he has this weird skateboard with carpet on it and a fucking PSP holder in there.
2779000	2780000	What a nut.
2780000	2781000	But you know what?
2781000	2782000	It was cool.
2782000	2784000	It was nice to meet him.
2784000	2786000	He actually has a podcast, too.
2786000	2790000	I don't even remember the name of it, but just a weird guy.
2790000	2793000	He's kind of like Mark Echoes on Kraken French.
2793000	2798000	Eccentric guy, but I was surprised with Hot Pixel, I thought it would suck.
2798000	2806000	But it was actually kind of, it was cute in a, I don't even know how to describe it.
2806000	2811000	It was such a weird, quirky, but in a different type of element.
2811000	2817000	I mean, the game is totally just like WarioWare, but the minigames are so different.
2817000	2818000	That's what I like about it.
2818000	2821000	I don't know.
2821000	2823000	I have another quickie for you guys.
2823000	2828000	99 Nights, I thought was great.
2828000	2832000	I thought, it's just mass murder of the game.
2832000	2835000	I loved it.
2835000	2844000	It's a little bit of button mashing, but I mean, there's a lot of stuff going on on the screen.
2844000	2845000	Gamer Andy's doing a dance.
2845000	2846000	Gamer Andy's already drunk.
2846000	2848000	Is this the 99 Nights dance?
2848000	2851000	Gamer Andy, say hi on Orange Lounge Radio, do a plug for your spiel.
2851000	2852000	Tell us about 99 Nights.
2852000	2854000	Hi Gamer Andy, what's on your mind?
2854000	2856000	Hi, this is Adam from Gamer Andy Live.
2856000	2857000	How are you today?
2857000	2858000	I am great.
2858000	2859000	That's great.
2859000	2860000	What do you think of 99 Nights?
2860000	2864000	You know, I played it at the Spring preview and I honestly thought it was more along the
2864000	2868000	realms of the button mashing, Dynasty Warriors-esque sort of thing.
2868000	2870000	Which personally isn't really for me.
2870000	2871000	Did you like it?
2871000	2872000	No, no dude.
2872000	2873000	Didn't like the cut scenes?
2873000	2875000	Didn't like any of that stuff?
2875000	2879000	Um, you know, the cut scenes were alright, but honestly I really just didn't quite get
2879000	2880000	into it.
2880000	2882000	It wasn't my groove, dude.
2882000	2883000	Sorry to hear it.
2883000	2885000	Yeah, you know, I mean, I wanted to like it though.
2885000	2888000	Alright, give a quick plug for your stuff.
2888000	2891000	Gamer Andy Live, tonight, after these guys.
2891000	2893000	After Orange Lounge Radio, which rocks by the way.
2893000	2895000	Thank you, appreciate it.
2895000	2896000	Alright.
2896000	2897000	He's drunk.
2897000	2899000	We gotta give the mic back to Jamie now.
2899000	2901000	Alright, um.
2901000	2903000	I had business.
2903000	2906000	I like, 99 Nights is a little bit of button mashing.
2906000	2909000	It's like Golden Axe, but like, I don't know.
2909000	2911000	That was what I was thinking about when I'm playing.
2911000	2913000	This is like Golden Axe, but with more.
2913000	2914000	I don't know.
2914000	2915000	I see Sonic.
2915000	2916000	Right.
2916000	2918000	Uh, Mortal Kombat Armageddon.
2918000	2920000	Did anyone else play this besides me?
2920000	2921000	Hell no.
2921000	2924000	You are a green vampire chick with an axe.
2924000	2927000	Created character is always awesome in my book.
2927000	2932000	And even though I'm a little disappointed Armageddon is only for the current gen stuff,
2932000	2934000	I think created character was great.
2934000	2935000	I made it.
2935000	2940000	Of course the created character that was in there when I loaded it up was the naked woman.
2940000	2941000	But how many of those have we seen?
2941000	2943000	I mean, when I say naked I mean, you know, bikini.
2943000	2945000	But how many of those have we seen in video games?
2945000	2948000	So I was gonna make a fun female character.
2948000	2954000	So I made a green vampire bitch with a huge meat cleaver as her weapon and it was awesome.
2954000	2955000	And you won.
2955000	2956000	I did.
2956000	2957000	I kicked the shit out of whoever.
2957000	2959000	I don't even remember what I was playing against.
2959000	2962000	Ermac or something, but it was cool.
2962000	2964000	I liked it.
2964000	2971000	I think it's a little like if you have the other two Mortal Kombat games from this current generation.
2971000	2974000	I don't think there's a lot else here.
2974000	2981000	But I mean, if you're a fan of Mortal Kombat, I think you'll have a good time.
2981000	2982000	Any other?
2982000	2983000	Oh, we got a call.
2983000	2984000	Let's go to the phones and answer the phones.
2984000	2986000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2986000	2988000	Hey, Jason.
2988000	2989000	Hey, Jason.
2989000	2990000	What's up?
2990000	2992000	How are you guys enjoying the game?
2992000	2993000	Good.
2993000	2996000	This is Jason, our webmaster, Jason.
2996000	2997000	Hi, Jason.
2997000	2998000	We miss having you here.
2998000	2999000	Why?
2999000	3000000	I wish you were here, Jason.
3000000	3001000	Why aren't you here?
3001000	3002000	I'm not here.
3002000	3006000	I'm not there because my truck demands me being here.
3006000	3007000	Oh, I'm sorry, Jason.
3007000	3011000	I'm getting insurance and all those things that actually require money for no good reason.
3011000	3013000	Oh, I hate that stuff.
3013000	3017000	What did you want to call in and say to our listeners besides the fact that you rock?
3017000	3020000	Because you do our website stuff for us.
3020000	3022000	It's a thankless job, and I love you for it.
3022000	3023000	You know that.
3023000	3026000	What did you want to say to our listeners?
3026000	3031000	I heard about the existence of, you know, Guitar Man Live, and I'm wondering if they've
3031000	3035000	actually kind of put this up and if you guys have gotten any more information on it.
3035000	3038000	Guitar Man Live, we got into a little bit yesterday.
3038000	3039000	It's Guitar Man Lives.
3039000	3040000	Lives, yeah.
3040000	3041000	Lives, whatever.
3041000	3042000	It's a port.
3042000	3043000	It's Guitar...
3043000	3044000	It's a port.
3044000	3046000	It's the same thing as the PS2 with the...
3046000	3047000	It has duet mode.
3047000	3048000	It's a port.
3048000	3052000	It's some little things, but if you're looking for new songs...
3052000	3053000	No.
3053000	3054000	No.
3054000	3055000	Sorry to say.
3055000	3057000	But if you accidentally pause it, you can continue.
3057000	3060000	You don't have to restart from the beginning.
3060000	3062000	Andy, that was always a nuisance with, uh...
3062000	3063000	Right.
3063000	3066000	With the groove, and if you actually played it on a dance pad and were a silly person
3066000	3068000	like me, cool.
3068000	3069000	Yeah.
3069000	3071000	Anything else, Jason?
3071000	3072000	Uh, not really.
3072000	3076000	I was hoping that it was mostly a new game, especially with the duet mode.
3076000	3080000	It was actually going to further the storyline or anything along those lines.
3080000	3084000	We were a little disappointed it's not a new game either, but at least the franchise isn't
3084000	3085000	dead.
3085000	3086000	I guess that's the silver lining.
3086000	3087000	At least they're still interested.
3087000	3088000	Very true.
3088000	3090000	So we'll see how it does on the market.
3090000	3091000	Excellent.
3091000	3093000	Jason, thanks so much for calling in.
3093000	3094000	Have a good one, okay?
3094000	3095000	Thank you.
3095000	3096000	All right.
3096000	3098000	Hey, you know, I checked out another neat game today.
3098000	3099000	What's that?
3099000	3101000	Uh, Shin Megami Tensei.
3101000	3103000	And real quickly, what's that about?
3103000	3109000	Well, um, it's sort of like a detective game with fighting zombies.
3109000	3112000	You'll have to tell us more about that after this call.
3112000	3113000	Yeah.
3113000	3114000	Hi, you're on Orange Mountains Radio.
3114000	3115000	Hello?
3115000	3116000	Hi, who's this?
3116000	3120000	I can't hear the caller.
3120000	3121000	I can't hear the caller.
3121000	3122000	What's your name, buddy?
3122000	3123000	Try again.
3123000	3124000	DJ Pooh Eater.
3124000	3125000	DJ Pooh Eater.
3125000	3127000	Oh, DJ Pooh Eater!
3127000	3128000	Hey!
3128000	3129000	Hey!
3129000	3130000	What's on your mind?
3130000	3133000	You're breaking up a little bit, so get your thought out.
3133000	3137000	I want to know that anymore.
3137000	3139000	I didn't catch that.
3139000	3143000	DJ Pooh Eater, we're going to have to let you go, buddy.
3143000	3146000	DJ Pooh Eater, we're going to have to let you go because you're breaking up too much.
3146000	3147000	But thanks for trying.
3147000	3148000	Maybe try again tomorrow.
3148000	3149000	All right.
3149000	3152000	Have a good one.
3152000	3153000	All right.
3153000	3154000	Are we?
3154000	3155000	Let's go to another call.
3155000	3156000	Let's try a different call.
3156000	3157000	Oh, they hung up.
3157000	3158000	Yeah.
3158000	3159000	Oh, here it is again.
3159000	3160000	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.
3160000	3163000	Hi, this is Jade at 2006.
3163000	3165000	Jade at 2006.
3165000	3166000	Hey!
3166000	3167000	What's on your mind, buddy?
3167000	3168000	Oh, nothing much.
3168000	3171000	This is mainly a question for Bobby.
3171000	3172000	Bobby!
3172000	3174000	A question for Bobby.
3174000	3175000	Uh-oh.
3175000	3176000	Bobby taking over our show.
3176000	3177000	Thanks a lot.
3177000	3178000	Noah, what's up?
3178000	3180000	What's the question for Bobby?
3180000	3184000	What is your honest opinion about Wii Music?
3184000	3186000	Okay, the Wii Music was just the Wii Orchestra.
3186000	3190000	They had a drum game, but it was closed off, even to media.
3190000	3192000	Like, you had to actually have an appointment to play it.
3192000	3193000	But the orchestra...
3193000	3194000	I'm glad Matt was the orchestra.
3194000	3195000	Yeah, the orchestra...
3195000	3197000	Okay, here's the thing.
3197000	3202000	I was having trouble with it because I've actually conducted an orchestra before.
3202000	3207000	And it's sometimes too sensitive, sometimes not sensitive enough.
3207000	3209000	But all it was was playing the Zelda theme.
3209000	3213000	And yeah, you can cue other places.
3213000	3215000	You can cue the back of the orchestra and they'll play louder.
3215000	3217000	You know, you can slow them down and start them up.
3217000	3219000	But it takes a little while to get used to it.
3219000	3220000	I only played through it twice.
3220000	3224000	When you play that game, do you look as fruity as Miyamoto did at the conference?
3224000	3225000	No, I actually look...
3225000	3226000	I look like a real...
3226000	3227000	Most people do.
3227000	3231000	They're like, you know, just waving their arms and like dancing around like he did.
3231000	3235000	You know, when I say Miyamoto's being fruity, I tease with love.
3235000	3239000	Because that's why we love him is because he's just a crazy little man.
3239000	3244000	Just to point out though, you're mentioning about having a hard time actually conducting
3244000	3245000	for real with it.
3245000	3246000	I did also...
3246000	3249000	When I went through there, Koji Kondo was playing.
3249000	3252000	And he actually, I can tell, wasn't doing true conducting.
3252000	3253000	Right.
3253000	3255000	Yeah, you have to do it like, you know, it's really rigid.
3255000	3259000	And it looks like it's actually, if you know anything about like conducting,
3259000	3262000	it's actually the up motion is what triggers it, not the down motion.
3262000	3264000	I learned that like right at the very end of my second thing.
3264000	3266000	I'm like, oh, it's going on the up.
3266000	3267000	All right.
3267000	3269000	J to 2006.
3269000	3270000	Any other thoughts for us?
3270000	3274000	Is it as easy as Miyamoto made it look? How about that?
3274000	3275000	Yeah.
3275000	3278000	I mean, you're not going to be good at it, but yeah, I mean, it's, you know,
3278000	3282000	waving your arms like people who've never done music stuff were able to get through it.
3282000	3283000	All right.
3283000	3285000	And it does score you at the end.
3285000	3286000	J to...
3286000	3287000	Oh, wonderful.
3287000	3288000	J to 2006.
3288000	3289000	We got to let you go.
3289000	3290000	We're going to start wrapping it up.
3290000	3291000	All right?
3291000	3292000	Okay.
3292000	3293000	All right.
3293000	3294000	Thanks so much for the call.
3294000	3295000	Have a good one.
3295000	3296000	Have a good one too.
3296000	3297000	All right.
3297000	3299000	Well, Poor Spirit Snare has been trying to call in for like the past 30 minutes.
3299000	3301000	And if somebody else always gets in...
3301000	3305000	Well, we got the wrap-up sign, so we got to start wrapping it up.
3305000	3308000	Spirit Snare, tomorrow, buddy, call in.
3308000	3309000	We'll get you.
3309000	3310000	I'm so sorry.
3310000	3312000	But of course, there's always the forums.
3312000	3313000	There's live journal.
3313000	3316000	This is for anybody that wants to talk to us, but maybe is too shy to call in.
3316000	3320000	Our stuff blog, stuff.orangelandrater.com.
3320000	3322000	Even MySpace if you really want to.
3322000	3325000	We've got all that stuff going on, so check it out.
3325000	3328000	Anyway, really quickly though, real quick, I had to do this for the shows overnight.
3328000	3330000	The FUs of the week.
3330000	3332000	Bobby, give us a little bit of the...
3332000	3335000	All right.
3335000	3336000	All right.
3336000	3339000	Dark Sakura, do you have any FUs so far at E3?
3339000	3342000	Not really, actually.
3342000	3343000	Really?
3343000	3344000	Yeah.
3344000	3349000	I've actually been pretty much okay with it, except I still think...
3349000	3350000	And this actually really surprised me.
3350000	3352000	My husband's actually pretty happy about it.
3352000	3361000	I want to say FU to Capcom, because why the hell are you going to put NES Strider on the PSP?
3361000	3363000	Oh, they put NES Strider on the PSP?
3363000	3364000	Yeah.
3364000	3372000	That Capcom classics collection is the NES versions of Mighty Final Fight, Bionic Commando,
3372000	3379000	which Dan was like, Bionic Commando, and the NES version of Strider, which actually isn't a bad game.
3379000	3382000	It's all based off of the Strider comics.
3382000	3385000	But I was like, I have these at home.
3385000	3387000	I can just play them at home.
3387000	3389000	Why do I want these on my PSP?
3389000	3392000	But what about those of us who don't have those at home?
3392000	3394000	Is it a bad thing to have?
3394000	3396000	You can download it.
3396000	3399000	So it is a bad thing to have if we don't have those games at home.
3399000	3401000	There's other ways to get it.
3401000	3402000	I just don't see any reason to...
3402000	3408000	They should have touched it up or made it a little bit cleaner, and it is an exact port of the NES ones.
3408000	3409000	Some people like that.
3409000	3412000	We gotta keep the angst flowing, because we gotta wrap it up.
3412000	3413000	Loki, your F.U.
3413000	3416000	My F.U. goes to Nintendo for a couple reasons.
3416000	3421000	The first, because their party wasn't exactly great, even if the black IPs were there,
3421000	3425000	and also because their booth sucks ass as far as the design goes,
3425000	3429000	and it makes it nearly impossible to play anything new that they have.
3429000	3431000	Notice I didn't talk about the Wii today.
3431000	3432000	That's because I didn't play it.
3432000	3437000	I tried to go to the line at 1230, and they told me, tough titty, because...
3437000	3439000	It closed at 10 o'clock.
3439000	3441000	They were doing a private party, which was more important.
3441000	3442000	Closed at 10.
3442000	3445000	Do your private party after hours.
3445000	3446000	Dummies.
3446000	3447000	Closed at 10 o'clock.
3447000	3448000	Bobby, your F.U.
3448000	3454000	My F.U. goes to three people, and one of them, his name is Scott Rubin,
3454000	3458000	who was supposed to be the one that was picking me up at 8.15 in the morning at my hotel,
3458000	3461000	so I could get there by 9 o'clock.
3461000	3467000	Unfortunately, he misjudged L.A. traffic and got to my hotel at 8.45,
3467000	3470000	and so that meant that I got to the convention center at 9.30.
3470000	3478000	My second F.U. goes to Redmond Carpolio from the Los Angeles newspaper group...
3478000	3481000	Who, by the way, is standing right in front of Bobby right now.
3481000	3483000	I know this is radio.
3483000	3484000	...who pulled some strings.
3484000	3486000	He was standing in the Nintendo line.
3486000	3488000	I was going to join him in the line, and he pulled some strings,
3488000	3490000	and they went into the Nintendo booth.
3490000	3493000	And my third F.U. goes to Lawrence Young for going with him
3493000	3496000	and not waiting for me because they did the Jack Bauer time going,
3496000	3499000	There's no time!
3499000	3504000	And then for Lawrence Young, the last F.U. was for calling me and saying,
3504000	3511000	Bobby B., I'm one foot away from Madden 07.
3511000	3514000	And I was like an hour and a half away from getting in, so...
3514000	3517000	I still love you, Lawrence, for whatever it's worth.
3517000	3521000	You edit the show so I don't have to. I love you for that.
3521000	3527000	My F.U. goes to the people that were waiting in line to see Paris Hilton.
3527000	3531000	Get out of my E3! Get out!
3531000	3534000	Those are the people that need to be sterilized.
3534000	3536000	Why would you stand in line to see her? Why?
3536000	3541000	It's a goddamn mobile game, too. Why? Shame on you.
3541000	3544000	That's a double negative, which is not a positive. That's a double bad thing.
3544000	3546000	A curse on all your houses.
3546000	3550000	A curse on your people. I hope you all go sterile.
3550000	3553000	Yes. May they never breed.
3553000	3556000	We gotta wrap it up. Final thoughts. Dark Soccer, your final thought.
3556000	3559000	Uh...nap.
3559000	3561000	Loki, your final thought.
3561000	3565000	My final thought is I'm gonna play Crackdown tomorrow because I forgot it was there.
3565000	3569000	Bobby, thanks for being here again. Your final thought.
3569000	3570000	Reject false icons.
3570000	3571000	Thank you.
3571000	3574000	I also forgot to mention, two nights in a row,
3574000	3579000	Superman Returns is fucking awesome, and it would be a better Grand Theft Auto game.
3579000	3581000	Yeah!
3581000	3585000	My final thought is Enchanted Arms looks really pretty. I wish they'd let me play it.
3585000	3586000	Yeah.
3586000	3591000	Alright. That's it. We gotta go, guys. We'll be back here Friday night live at the E3 Outpost.
3591000	3596000	Thanks to the E3 Outpost staff for having us. If you're listening live, Gamer Andy's up next.
3596000	3601000	So don't go anywhere or he will come find you and disco dance at your living room.
3601000	3603000	They can take a quick pee break if they need to.
3603000	3606000	That's scary. Yeah, you can do a quick pee break, but be back here by 9.
