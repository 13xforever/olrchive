Good evening, everybody.
We are live at the E3 Outpost in West Los Angeles.
So if the sound sounds a little bit different tonight, that's because we're recording live here at the Arena Interactive Lounge.
My name is Rob Roberts.
You might know me as Sky.
Joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
Hi.
How you doing?
Tired.
Yeah?
I'm excited and tired at the same time.
It's a very bizarre feeling.
Say hello as well to Tech Master Loki.
Hello.
How you doing, Loki?
I'm doing good.
All right.
Also joining us tonight, we have some special guests, or a special guest, I should say.
Say hello to Bobby.
Bobby.
Hey guys.
Hey Bobby.
This is a thrill for me.
It's about time we got you on our show.
It just took E3 to finally get you here.
That's alright.
Also we want to say a shout out to Mr. Lawrence Young who's manning the controls tonight.
We appreciate his help in making the show work.
Alright, let's get right into it.
Let's not waste time.
Let's talk about E3.
I thought we could do, let's go down the line and talk about three interesting things we saw at E3 today.
Jamie, give us one.
I would have to say Zelda Twilight Princess.
Getting to play that was pretty fun.
Now, did you play the Zelda Twilight Princess on the Wii?
Wii!
The Wii!
I played on the Wii, and I went Wii.
Did Nintendo have a huge-ass line for the Wii today?
Not if you made it in there in the early... We got in there at the tail end of the early media hours.
Right.
So we just sort of... Once we got in line, it was pretty cool.
I did get to hear... I never remember his name.
I know his name's Charles, the guy who's Mario's voice.
Oh, right, yeah.
Sing the old Mario theme song from the Super Mario Brothers Super Show.
That's awesome.
The guys in front of us got him to, the guys from the Mushroom Kingdom, got him to sing it.
So I have it on tape.
Sweet.
That's awesome.
It was pretty fun.
So tell us about how is Zelda on the Wii different from what we saw last year with the GameCube?
Well, first of all, I didn't get to see it on the GameCube, so I don't know.
I do know that it is widescreen, whereas the GameCube version is not.
All right, I'm so glad to hear there's widescreen support, because I was really worried about that with Wii.
Well, you're going to get 480p.
Good.
But probably nothing more than that.
All right.
Well, you know, it's something.
At least my widescreen TV isn't going to go to total waste.
So that makes me happy.
Alright, so that's one for Jamie.
Loki, what would you say is one interesting thing you saw today?
My favorite, you know, it was really a toss-up on Sega's booth because there's a few things I liked.
I did get to play my first PS3 game, which would be Full Auto 2.
And, of course, you know, me being such a big Full Auto whore.
They have Full Auto 2 there?
I totally missed that.
Yeah, they had full auto too.
They were debuting basically all the deathmatch modes, which I said should have been in the first one, but no.
So anyways, they had that, and we were basically playing six-player deathmatch and stuff, and if you won, you'd get a hat.
Of course, I don't wear hats, so I didn't care.
But overall, the controls are basically the same.
Horrible framerate problems, just like the first one.
I mean, we're talking dropping down a crawl.
but then again it's not finished either, so.
Do you think it's just an early build issue?
Well, you know, I'm not sure because the fact the first one had really bad frame rate problems too, so you never know.
But I am sure it's not done.
Okay.
I just want to remind folks, if you guys are hearing ambient noise in the background, that is because we're not at your usual studio.
We are at the Arena Interactive Lounge where the E3 Outpost has taken place.
If you're in the LA area, this thing's going on all week.
Come on down.
We're off Santa Monica Boulevard.
We'll be here Thursday and Friday taping live as well.
Other folks are taping too.
Scott Rubin and Lawrence Young doing their show.
Gamer Andy's got his gig going on.
Bobby Blackwolf, Friday night, of course.
You know what this place is?
There's big widescreen TVs everywhere.
It's like a big gamer frat house.
Yeah.
Seriously, what it's like.
It's awesome.
It's cool.
So, again, if we sound a little different out of our elements, it's because we are, but that's a good thing.
So, anyway, I just wanted to give that a plug because we are kind of using their equipment tonight, so we have to give them a big thank you.
And we're also in their chat room because of it.
We're trying to keep an eye on it.
It's a little harder because we're not in our usual setup.
Chat.allgames.com Thank you.
And there's this wristband on my arm that says over 21, which means they have alcohol here.
That means you get to drink.
I got asked if I was over 21.
You always get carded.
No, we didn't get those, so we'll get those later.
Anyway.
Oh, yeah.
You're interesting.
My interesting thing.
I'm going to give a shout-out to the music game fans, because I know we have a lot of music game fans that listen to the program and are dying to know.
So let me talk about the Bomani setup at Konami's booth, which was very interesting.
They sort of have a round setup.
2DX Distorted Machine is there.
Guitar Freaks V2 is there.
Why?
I have no idea.
Konami did not announce that Distorted is coming out for the home here.
They did not announce they're porting Guitar Freaks here in the US.
So they were just there to get butts in the booth, I guess.
I did get a chance to play each of the three new DDR home versions.
I did play around on Universe.
Universe looks a lot better than it does in the trailer, I'll tell you that.
Universe has a very disco, funky feel to it.
The interface is a little crazy.
The song select was kind of... It's like a 3D wheel.
I liked it.
Yeah, I kind of liked it.
I dug it.
And there are repeats from old mixes.
I noticed Gyruss was in the demo.
And there's other stuff, too.
I'm sure...
TDR, Freak Group, OmaniStyle have lists posted already of what's on those games.
I actually really liked Ultramix 4.
I kind of thought Ultramix 4 had the better song list.
The interface is just kind of like an upside-down Ultramix 2.
I mean, it's another Ultramix, but I thought it had a better song list.
It has Listen to Your Heart, it had Bitmania.
I had a lot of fun playing that.
I tried playing doubles on Universe and unfortunately they had the pads set backwards.
So that didn't work.
Supernova is exactly what you'd expect.
And of course they have two Supernova machines, the home version.
But, Jamie, did you play DDR Supernova home version?
No.
David Bowie's in it.
Let's dance.
D.D.R.
Especially these demos.
My thrill on DDR is the extra modes and the extra things that are in it, and they're not in these builds.
I was just glad they had freaking arcade cabinets there because I hate playing on those goddamn softpads.
Did you notice that they have the softpads?
It's like literally saran-wrapped to the floor.
This is not duct tape.
What did you think of the Universe 360 pads?
They're just like soft pads.
I get lost on them again because, you know, I don't know.
I'm actually going to go play Karaoke Revolution Country Edition tomorrow.
Alright, I'm going to our chat room.
Remember, we're temporarily tonight in chat.
Allgames.com will be there all week long because we love Allgames.com.
Let's see.
Weiland wants to know, wait, Bowie is in what?
David Bowie's Let's Dance is going to be a danceable song in DDR Supernova.
And then also going to the chat room there, let's see.
Sephiroth1215, one of our fans, says, I hate Kelly.
Well, you know, a lot of people do, but a lot of people like her, you know?
Speaking of Kelly, it seems that they've dropped the Karaoke Revolution title from American Idol, if you noticed that on the trailer.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, no, I didn't notice.
Well, they didn't really... First off, the game's not even to a point where they can show it at E3, which is why we have country here.
But they dropped the title.
All they really had for the video was just, you know, the intro that you see normally on American Idol.
And it just says, coming in the winter.
Weird.
All right.
Bobby, do you have an interesting thing you want to share with us that you saw today?
Well, unfortunately I didn't get to play all that much today just because of getting in late and just walking around and making sure I saw everything.
Other than the utterly disappointing Square Theater, which is usually a wonderful production with great production values, lights everywhere, everything's synchronized.
This time it was just a digital projection.
I did get to play Gitaro Man Lives.
for the PSP.
And you're sitting there, you're smiling and nodding.
I wouldn't.
It is a straight port of the PlayStation 2.
Same music, same note patterns and everything.
The only thing that has changed is now if you pause it, you can continue.
You don't have to start over.
Actually, you also have a duet mode.
Do they?
Because they didn't show that.
You play as Kira, who was, I guess, the girl in the game.
You can do duet mode with her, and there's a versus mode.
Okay.
There was a versus mode in PS2 version, though.
It was showing it off like it was some sort of Mew thing, but the duet mode I know is Mew.
Okay.
Interesting.
But it's still all the same songs?
That is a bit of a letdown.
I was hoping for some new Guitar Room Man, but I guess some people will be excited to see that it's on the go.
Yeah.
Okay, whatever.
I wanted to go back to this Square Enix trailer.
You know, I feel horrible saying this because I thought Square had some of the nicest staff that I dealt with all day.
They had really great staff, and they were nice.
But the trailer presentation was a letdown because a lot of what they were showing was stuff that's already out.
Final Fantasy VII Advent Children.
Although...
Yeah.
Didn't they, Lauren?
We'll see, we'll see.
I mean, again, these trailers, it's the same reason why I'm not screaming and hollering about Halo 3 yet.
It's a trailer that didn't show us much of the actual game itself, you know what I mean?
Let's wait until I can actually get my hand on the controller, play it, try it out.
You know what, the Square thing will give the fans what they want, so whatever.
They'll have a good time with that.
Jamie, number two, a second interesting thing you saw today.
Guitar Hero 2.
Ah, how is that compared to... It was fun, but it basically brought in the two... Actually, it really added in something else that I wouldn't have minded seeing.
I wanted bass mode in the first one, and this gives me bass mode.
Instead of having versus play, you have cooperative play, which is how I think it should be anyway.
If you've got a band on stage, if one person sucks, the whole band's going to pretty much blow it.
Mm-hmm.
But the way it works now is that player one is lead guitar, player two, depending on song, is either bass or rhythm.
And they're even bringing in the very newest models for their available guitars, the newest Gibson guitars available.
They're still going to have the Flying V, they brought in the Thunderbirds.
Thunderbird now.
They still have the Les Paul, the SGs.
and there's still hidden characters in it, new unlockable content.
I played YYZ, that was like cool.
That was really awesome.
So, I mean, are there enough differences from the first game to make this, you know, a worthwhile sequel?
I didn't see enough to really make a judgment like that yet.
But, you know, just having new songs to play is great.
If it were me, I would have been... I mean, I know it is on PlayStation 2, but...
FanTaz says Halo 3 teaser ripped off System Shock.
So, not a person who wasn't a big fan of the Halo 3, or maybe he was a fan of the Halo 3 teaser, but just felt it, ripped off another one.
Funnydale says, it's sad, Square is turning Final Fantasy into the new Madden.
I kind of agree with that.
They need to get off Final Fantasy 7.
They are killing it.
Final Fantasy 7 football, I bet, will be next year's announcement.
What do you think?
It looks like some folks in the chat room are getting buffer tonight.
Guys, I'm sure we're getting bombarded with people tonight, which is amazing.
Thank you guys for supporting the show.
Don't forget it will be on our podcast stream a little later.
Let's see.
Somebody had said something about Guitar Room Man.
I want to say it was Xander here.
Xander C says, I restarted at least three times accidentally on the original Guitar-O-Man because I couldn't pause.
So that new feature will come in handy.
Xander also says, Final Fantasy Versus XIII is being made by the Kingdom Hearts 2 team.
That's correct.
It's a joint production.
Yeah, Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy.
But here's the thing, dude.
That's all we know about Final Fantasy Versus XIII.
The trailer didn't tell us shit.
It tells you that there's a main male character who has psychic Miss Cleo gone way wrong abilities and that's about it.
All right, anyway.
Throw a gunblade.
In the original Final Fantasy XIII, yes.
Yeah.
And then there's a Final Fantasy XIII mobile, but I'm not even going to go there because I'll cry.
Loki!
Something interesting.
Um, well, let's see here.
Um, I did, of course, also play the Wii.
I got to play Red Steel.
And that was okay, actually.
I don't know, I'm still kind of... It's the first time I've played it, and I thought that the controls were way too sensitive.
Like...
It was very awkward playing it, and it did not feel natural.
And if I were a very judgmental mom buying this for my kids, I would probably be turned away by it if it's going to stay like this.
Because it wasn't easy, but...
There were other games that were also being shown, like WarioWare, which was really awesome.
I mean, just what they're doing with the controller is amazing.
What you would expect from a WarioWare game.
Overall, though, the Wii stuff, I did play Red Steel, I played a WarioWare, and this kind of like obstacle course tech demo thing.
And each one very sensitive as far as the control scheme goes.
Now, Loki and DarkSakura, I didn't spend a lot of time at Nintendo's booth today.
It was so crowded.
I hate their layout this year.
I think the layout is ass.
It's like a claustrophobic nightmare.
I'm sorry, Nintendo, but having that huge dome in the middle, that was a horrible idea.
But tell us about, for those, because a lot of folks listening aren't going to E3, how is Nintendo's booth set up?
How did you guys get in there?
What happens when you get in there?
Well, you're around basically the surrounding wall when you're in line and you go in, and it's like a spiral.
They have these talking walls.
They're like walls of pictures of people sitting in white rooms or whatever, but they actually have a camera and can talk to you, and they have the voice of Mario there.
Yeah, that's how we got to hear him sing.
But it was funny, though, because I was like, well, why do they have people mocking me in line as I'm waiting?
But I don't know.
It was interesting, a little bit different.
I don't know what the point was, but...
There was one of those guys that was very knowledgeable and kept giving a lot of really good information.
It was sort of like having a rep there to talk with you while you're in line to sort of hype you up to go see it.
But once you got in, you circled around and went on this raised platform with sort of half of it covered in a picture on one side and the other side.
And then there were three in the middle.
and three widescreen TVs and different people were playing different games.
There's another one on the wall, but that was sort of for when they did the drum demo.
Yeah.
But when we went through there, Koji Kondo was playing the orchestra game and I got his autograph.
Sweet.
That made me very, very happy.
Was that orchestra thing actually a game or just a demo?
It's a game.
It's a demo.
I thought they said it was going to... It's a tech demo.
Well, I guess we will see.
All right.
Ah, shut up.
If I wanted your opinion, I'd turn your mic on.
Because they had a series of demo games playable and they were bringing out different ones as though they were going to be released later on as packaged items.
At least as far as I was led to believe.
Well, looking at what they were talking about yesterday during the press conference is that they have this Wii Sports thing.
And it actually looks like a collection of a bunch of small games.
Almost like, remember the first Nintendo system where they had it packaged with Mario and Duck Hunt?
they would have a bunch of small tech demo things that kind of almost orient you to this new control scheme so they have the baseball, golf, tennis and a pilot wings type of game which is very kind of different Bobby, a second interesting thing you saw today
Blink, blink, blink, blink.
The sensitive controls of Sonic the Hedgehog on the PS3.
Wasn't that weird?
It made me cry.
I was not a fan of Sonic on PS3, I have to admit.
Do you know how many times I fell off the edge?
Yeah, I watched.
It had so much potential to be good, and...
And I can see Jamie getting motion sickness from that, just because of the way it was jumping around.
I left it with a headache.
I mean, I felt nauseous and had a headache, and on top of that, my heart was broken.
So, thank you, Sony.
Well, do you think the Xbox version will be just as bad?
That's in the Sega booth, we'll have to check.
Yeah, we'll have to look tomorrow.
I'm going to find out, and if it is, then I'll blame Sega, and I'll go cry there.
I played the one in the Sega booth, and the controls, the camera kind of was pissing me off, and I couldn't figure out how to play.
I was playing the Silver Sonic one.
They had two different levels, one as Sonic, one as Silver Sonic.
Silver Sonic being like Super Duper Super Saiyan Sonic with psycho, you know, kinetic powers and crap, so I don't know.
Now, one of the things I do want to mention about the PS3 controller, because we got to actually see it and play it, that a lot of people don't realize, because you've never really seen a good look of it.
And yes, the PlayStation Circle button in the middle is touchable.
It didn't do anything in what we had.
But the L2 and the R2 buttons are now like the triggers on the Xbox.
They're not straight buttons.
They are actually, you know...
analog triggers.
I thought that was kind of interesting.
I missed my number two.
My number two thing I thought was interesting today would be Luminous Live.
It's way back in the corner of the very crowded Microsoft booth, but oh my god.
It's just Luminous on the TV.
That's all I wanted.
It's great.
I mean, and if this is only going to be five bucks, I'm betting it'll probably be 800 points, not 400.
But even then, I...
Thanks for watching!
Any of you other guys go to Microsoft's booth today?
It sounds like you guys spent most of your day in West Hall, whereas Bobby and I are mostly in South Hall today.
I saw a Viva Pinata, the demo, the presentation of Viva Pinata in there.
And it's like, let's see, Animal Crossing meets Harvest Moon meets Spore meets some other stuff probably.
It's kind of the way it looked.
And I still don't know really what it is.
Remind me to look for Spore tomorrow.
It's all in EA's stuff.
We've totally missed EA today.
We'll definitely have more tomorrow.
Didn't they say they were going to have a new Need for Speed game?
I was looking for that today, but I didn't see it at all.
Was it Need for Speed Carbon, I think?
One more interesting thing you saw today, DarkSakura.
I know you're typing in chat right now.
Oh, you're arguing with somebody about graphics versus gameplay?
That pisses me off so much.
What I just said is I don't want a pretty game that plays like crap.
A system that's only as good as the games that are on it?
Exactly.
I said that to a Sony rep today and he just sort of blinked at me.
It was funny.
Why does that not surprise me?
No, he blinked, and he thought about it, because you know you're right.
Alright.
Alright, anyway, my number one, and actually my list has been about equal, but I have to say Sonic Rivals on PSP.
Yeah?
I loved it.
Oh my god, it was like everything that I loved about Sonic with Racing Shadow.
And it was like playing a 2D Sonic, but 3D.
It was...
Just fast and great, and I just had the most fun, and then they gave me a t-shirt that I can't wear.
It's like three sizes too big.
Well, that's cool.
Does Sega have a theater this year?
I didn't see, I don't think so.
I'm going to explore Sega in more detail tomorrow, but I was just like, I'm...
It's a really good Sonic game on PS3.
I mean, it's only one level I got to play, but if the whole thing's like that, I'm all over that.
I mean, it's just all the fast, fun stuff I liked about Sonic, and I didn't get to see too much more than just what they had on demo, but I'm hoping that there's a multiplayer race, because you have first place, second place.
I would assume you can do more characters.
I mean, it'd be sort of Sonic R, just on a side-scrolling level.
I think it's pretty cool.
Loki!
I played Dead Rising.
That game is really fun.
You basically put in the Dawn of the Dead scenario with you can do anything.
I was picking up pots, smashing the people.
I ate a pie.
I was playing around with the ServBot masks and stuck one on a zombie and smashed it with a sledgehammer.
That game is going to be endless hours of fun for me.
It's so gory, but really fun.
I'm definitely getting it when it comes out.
Awesome.
Bobby, you got one more?
Well, I mean, it's not as interesting as what everybody else played, because like I said, I didn't get to play the Wii, which is what I would be talking about.
But we actually looked at the new .hack game.
I was actually thinking about that.
Yeah, the .hack, it's what, GU or something like that?
Yeah.
I don't remember what it was.
It's like Rebirth or something.
Right, but it looks like it's going to be another episodic.
The guy that I talked to didn't know what price it was going to be or anything.
But it looked more the same.
Now, it did have a lot more animations and stuff, and I actually got the typical anime where it shows the three main characters in a split-screen view for half a second, then they all go crazy and everything goes red.
But the demo, I wish it was longer.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Um, gosh, what should I do for my last interesting thing?
I'm gonna say, uh, Phantasy Star Universe.
Phantasy Star Universe, uh, I got to play it on PC, which looked superior to the PS2 one I saw.
Um...
It's great because they didn't change a lot of the Phantasy Star online formula.
They just made it a little better.
You can do a little more super attacks.
It looked like he had some more tactical points kind of thing.
You can only do so many power hits in a row.
So you can't just keep boring those power hits.
But you can actually get in a fourth hit.
Thanks.
I think Phantasy Star Universe is going to be, if you guys are on Phantasy Star Online, it's going to be great for you guys.
Unfortunately, the only disappointment I have with that is that they weren't showing the 360 version.
So that kind of made me a little sad.
Alright, so I guess we all got our interesting things out.
I got a wacky question.
Can we take calls?
Yes, you can.
Can we do calls?
Yes.
Give out the number, Bobby.
Okay, well you can either use... Do we have both Skype and the toll-free number?
Give out the toll-free number, because you don't want to have to have all those people on Skype.
Okay.
The toll-free number is 1-866-880-0156.
That's a toll-free number here in the United States.
Go ahead and put that in chat.
Lawrence, one call at a time, though, because when we get like two people on the line, I get crazy.
So...
All right, real quick, though, while we're waiting for some calls.
Booth Babes, big controversy, and there really weren't a whole lot on the show for this year.
I saw some on that Final Fantasy, and I remember I turned to you and I'm like, $5,000?
Well, they were Mithra girls, though.
They were more cosplayers than Booth Babes.
What do you think?
Is the show different without Booth Babes?
I didn't notice they weren't there.
I didn't notice, nor did I miss, nor did I care.
I didn't really notice either, and I hope I don't come off sounding like the token gay guy of the show saying that, but I just... I really didn't change the show, because the show's about the games, not about that scenery, and people were going in to see the games anyway.
What was that?
Somebody had come up with a creative substitute for the booth babes.
What were you guys talking about in the bus?
We were talking about the Transformers.
I don't know if that was Lawrence.
Yeah, there's an Optimus Prime in one of the booths, and there's no Transformers game in there, but it got him in the booth.
There was a banner for the Transformers movie.
Oh, is that what it was?
Yeah.
Oh, Savages.
Savages.
Savages.
Bunch of Savages.
Where's my game?
Alright.
They did a Transformers game and it wasn't very good.
They've done several and they've all been wrong.
PlayStation 3.
It sounds like we all got to play PlayStation 3 today.
Did your impressions of the PlayStation 3 go up from the Sony conference?
Were you disappointed?
What did you think?
DarkSakura, I'll go ahead and start with you.
I also played Gran Turismo HD and it was like another Gran Turismo and it was pretty but honestly I also saw that Heavenly Blade
My opinion still remains the same.
Sony shot themselves... It's actually Heavenly Sword.
Heavenly Sword, sorry.
I'm thinking of Dancing Blade, which is another PlayStation game.
I still think that they've shot themselves in the foot and this time with having not the best of games to show for it.
We have a caller on the line.
Okay.
Finish your thought, then I'll say hello to the caller.
It was crap then and crap now.
Alright.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio live at the E3 Outpost.
Who's this?
The Ichiban Crush!
The Ichiban Crush, one of my very favorite posters on the forums.
What's on your mind, buddy?
Yo, so, I'm looking at the E3 news on Monday and see the price announcement for PS3.
I can't help but wonder myself, man, but, I mean, I know this is Blu-ray and you're not going to, you just cannot get any cheaper than that, but is this thing really going to sell, yo?
Um, here's my thing with PlayStation 3.
Sony has really yet to explain why their console is worth 200 more bucks than Xbox 360.
And in playing the demos today, I mean, for instance, Sonic, Sonic is a game that's on Xbox 360.
Why do I need to invest the extra money in the PlayStation 3?
However, to PlayStation 3's credits...
They do have a grip on some of the real great franchises.
That Metal Gear Solid 4 trailer is, you know, fanboy, boner-inducing.
Final Fantasy XIII, I mean, you know, I'm a big Final Fantasy fan, so of course I'm like, oh, oh god.
And, you know, they've got games that I think are going to cater to the fanboys.
You know, but they're still, for the average gamer...
Microsoft's in a great position right now because their system is cheaper and it's at glance right now seems to do the same thing as PlayStation 3.
What was missing from that conference for me was that Sony didn't tell me why I needed Blu-ray.
Does anybody else have thoughts on that?
Well, I don't know.
I've actually played Final Fantasy XII, and if that's any indication of what Final Fantasy XIII is going to be, then I'm better off without it.
I love Final Fantasy XII a whole lot.
Final Fantasy XII had the single worst combat system ever.
It took the stuff that was good about Grandia and made it crap.
We agree to disagree there, I suppose.
Like, what was with that whole line business?
Xander C in chat doesn't like Microsoft.
Xander C says Microsoft has yet to show why their console is worth more than $150.
The stuff they're doing with Arcade and Gears of War is incredible.
Guys, I know how you feel.
If you had told me four years ago I would be here saying positive things about Microsoft, I would have said you're full of shit.
Are we watching Lost Planet right now?
Yes, this is Lost Planet.
That looks really good.
This is one reason why this console is worth the money that it is.
Lost Planet right here, Capcom really has
I'll be honest with you, Sky
I'm really, really worried about this whole upcoming next gen, just mainly because of Sony.
I don't think it's going to cause another crash like everyone's been saying for the past two decades, but
I don't know.
I'm just not feeling it this time around.
Not the way I was with the 16-bit, 32-bit eras.
You know, it's a different battle this time because the battle is not just about the games, but it's about getting that console in your living room so you can get the music and the on-demand movies and all this other stuff.
That's a factor that we've never had to really deal with before.
So I think that's kind of what makes a lot of this very interesting.
So...
But yeah, you're right.
This one is too hard to tell because look at Japan.
Xbox has really yet to catch on there.
Is it going to catch wildfire after E3?
I don't know.
It's hard for me to say.
I think what would be most interesting about this is if Microsoft ends up on top here in the U.S.
And again, I'm purely speculating, guys.
Please don't take this as my opinion on what's going to happen or whatever.
But what if Microsoft's on top here in the U.S.
and then Sony's on top in Japan?
Wouldn't that be something?
Yeah.
That means that we're still going to get another crappy PlayStation later on.
I hope Sony's taking the feedback.
It seems like they did it before when everybody bitched about the Boomerang controller.
They went back and changed it, so hopefully Sony's listening this time.
Who knows?
The boomerang just looks uncomfortable.
I have a controller that likes the boomerang.
It's not good.
Ichimon Crush, you know I love you, but I gotta let you go so we can get more cars in, alright?
Absolutely.
Thanks, guys.
Thanks for calling.
Y'all have a good one.
Alright, you too.
One thing I want to add before he called was about, you were talking about Gran Turismo, and a lot of people probably looked at the demo and they're like, oh, that's so cool, the people move.
Well, I'm going to tell you right now, they are still 2D paper people.
I looked, and, you know, the people, because that's one of the things a lot of people have about the Gran Turismo series is that the people look like they're like 2D pieces of paper, and they still are in that early demo.
Listen.
I played the Tokyo track, and it... I'm gonna...
we're gonna go to another call guys hi you're on orange launch radio live at e3 outpost who's this hello this is nintendo maniac 64 or uh bad starter maniac hi nintendo maniac 64 how you doing um i'm ecstatic over the cold freeze thing because i'm all the way in the east coast you're ecstatic about the what oh the freeze going on right now
Yeah.
What's going on?
Is the weather nuts or something?
It's been kind of hot.
It's been kind of hot recently.
Well, tell us about E3.
What are your thoughts on E3 so far?
The one thing that caught my attention actually was in Nintendo's press conference when they were showing the CS game, they showed Diddy Kong Racing.
They happened to show Snowball Valley from the original on there, which was interesting.
I... You've got a good eye, because honestly, I was one of those people that didn't really care about Diddy Kong Racing because I was too distracted by the thoughts of Star Fox on the DS.
Because they kind of showed that all at once, and I was like, ooh, Star Fox!
Ah, fuck Diddy Kong, I want Star Fox!
Diddy Kong Racing sucked anyways.
Well, that's... No, this is Nintendo Maniac, so he might have a different opinion.
So... Alright.
You got any questions for us, Nintendo Maniac?
Um... Um...
Oh, yeah, um, you... Oh, you know what, never mind on that question.
Alright.
Okay.
Let's see, is there anything else?
Oh, how long did you have to wait to get to play Twilight Princess?
To get to play what?
To get to play Twilight Princess.
I can't... Twilight Princess.
Oh, Twilight Princess, uh... Um, I waited about 30 to 45 minutes.
Thanks for watching!
Yeah, see, it takes about an hour to two and a half hours from what they told me to get into the Wii area.
And then you've got to wait behind people.
It's just normal kiosk once you get in there.
All right, Nintendo Maniacs64, thanks so much for the call.
We're going to go ahead and let you go, buddy, okay?
Okay.
All right, have a good one.
All right, we're going to take one more call.
Let's see who we got.
Lawrence Young, the man on the controls.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Hey, this is SSJ100 Matt.
SSJ100 Matt, what's on your mind, buddy?
Thanks for the call.
What's going on?
Hey, I was wondering what you guys thought of the new test, the new test numbers on SSJ100.
Super Smash Bros.
from Metal Gear Solid.
That is crazy.
Pit from Kid Icarus.
Yay!
Nintendo, thank you for finally fucking acknowledging this game you've ignored for the past like 20 years.
You have Wario as going to be another one.
And also Zero Suit Samus.
That's pretty hot.
Which was pretty interesting.
And then there was one more.
I want to say... Oh, God.
I don't remember.
Some metal robot thing.
But one of the very interesting things that's on here, they show one of the attacks.
And what's one of the attacks?
But a Nintendog licking the screen.
Oh, Jesus.
He's so puppy.
You guys.
Snake has his box.
All right.
That's great.
SSJ100, Matt, we've got to wrap up, but thanks so much for the call, all right?
All right.
Have a good one, buddy.
All right.
So that's going to be our last call for the night.
We're going to wrap up so that we can get out of here so all games interactive can take over for a little bit.
Oh, no, I'm getting the stretch it out sign.
Okay, never mind then, we won't.
Comments from chat room, Boss Tone, Toshin, they all want to know, Dance Dance TV, what the hell do we think of this?
If you guys didn't hear...
What is it?
Loki, correct me if I'm wrong, because I was reading about this late last night.
CBS Television is optioned Dance Dance TV, right?
Yeah.
And Dance Dance TV is going to be a show that's going to be, what, the Saturday morning slumber party on CBS or something like that?
I don't know, and I'm kind of afraid to even consider wanting to know.
What I picked up on it is that it's like it's supposed to be teams of kids competing against each other and it's inspired by DDR or something like that.
So you know what guys?
From Konami's perspective, it's all about whatever's gonna sell more games, right?
I don't see this as a bad thing.
Am I gonna watch it?
Fuck no.
But am I gonna hate it just because it's out there?
No.
I understand we gotta do crazy things to promote our stuff sometimes.
I don't think it's a bad thing, and I don't think it's gonna make DDR look stupid because...
Honestly, if somebody were to come up to me and tell me, dude, you're playing that DDR game that's on a little girl's morning TV show, I would say, dude, you were watching Saturday morning TV for little girls.
I don't know.
It looks stupid.
I'm not watching it, but I don't know.
Xander C in chatroom says they're a little late to be making a DDR TV show.
They should have tried that back in 2002.
Remember DDR the movie?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Well, this, I was a little surprised that the games that are on it, they have the NES versions of the games.
They have the Nintendo version of Strider, which was, I don't like it, because it's that whole story thing based off of the old Strider manga that was out a few years ago.
Um...
I would much rather have them do, like, you know, a Mega Drive collection where we have, you know, like, the actual Arcade Strider and, you know, actual Arcade Final Fight in this, you know, because the PSP could easily do it, but these are Nintendo... This is going to be random, but I forgot to tell you, Strider's on GameCapt now.
I need that.
Pretty hot, huh?
You told me yesterday.
Now, Jamie, did you see that they had that Capcom Classic Collection Mini that's going to be on the Game Boy Advance, which has Strider and Bionic Commando?
Well, the other game that was on the PSP thing was Bionic Commando.
Excellent.
And honestly, I love Mighty Final Fight, but I have that on Nintendo.
I have all those on Nintendo.
I can just play them on Nintendo.
and so on.
around Capcom and Sega and Namco, Bondi tomorrow.
Alright.
Going to chat room for some comments here.
Rockus, OLRRockus wants to know in chat.allgames.com, song list updates for the DDRs, anyone?
Honestly, I'm going to be honest with you, check DDRFreak.com or BomaniStyle.com, I'm sure they have it up.
I know I played Precious, some remix of Precious by Depeche Mode in the Universe one, and I played Listen to Your Heart in Ultramix 4, and I played Since You've Been Gone on Supernova.
I did get to play Seduction in the vocal mix now, which is in Supernova in the arcade.
Sweet.
Actually, I did want to issue a challenge.
Okay.
If any of our listeners are at E3, I would love to meet people up at SNK to own them on King of Fighters 2006.
Awesome.
Quick programming note, just for people here on the live stream.
Sorry to you podcast folks who are here.
That's alright.
All Games Interactive will be going on after Gamer Andy.
We're not, so we're going, OLR is going to go until about 8.15.
Oh, are we really?
Okay.
So I'm letting them know at the same time instead of trying to whisper in their ear.
So yeah, but Gamer Andy, live from the Microsoft Press Conference at 8.15 And then All Games Interactive at 9.30 when they get kicked out of the Microsoft Press Conference So don't worry about ending right now, you've got a little while longer If you want to take more calls, that's cool Alright, maybe we'll do more calls in a little bit For right now though, let's finish up this thought we were going down Something you want to look at tomorrow Loki, what are you going to be doing tomorrow?
I will probably be hitting up the Sony booth because I was mainly in South Hall today.
So I need to hit up West Hall.
There's still parts of South Hall that I haven't seen so I might need to go back there.
I actually hit up a lot of the Korean booths today.
I think just because I was that bored.
I don't know.
Probably just hitting up...
Some of the games I haven't played for Sony, just trying all the new ones.
Maybe trying Nintendo again to see if I can try playing Metroid Prime 3 or something like that.
Other than that, I don't know.
Oh, I've got to check out the PSP stuff, definitely.
Yeah, I didn't do that either.
We got the call sign, so let's go to the phones.
Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
This is SilentWind96.
Hello, SilentWind96.
What's on your mind?
Oh, just chilling here.
I'm down the street in my hotel.
Come on down.
I couldn't get a pass.
I couldn't get a temporary job at EB Games or nothing so I could get into this joint.
Wait, wait.
You couldn't get into E3 at all?
No, I don't have any credentials to get in, so I couldn't really... No, come to the outpost.
You know what?
At the outpost, you don't need a credential.
You can get in here.
Oh, really?
I'll tell you what, you know what?
I'll get you in.
We will get you in this place for free, right?
Can we do that?
Yeah.
All right.
He'll get in our meeting.
You know what?
Does he have a... Can you send somebody... How do we get him in touch with us?
Actually, you're in chat, so you just PM me your name.
Okay, I want you to send a private message to BlackWolf, and he'll get you in touch.
Okay.
Get on down here.
You can get in this place, at least.
All right.
Any questions you want to know about?
I'm so sorry to hear you didn't get in.
Anything you want to mention about the show?
Well, first of all, I love the show, guys.
I have a crappy internet connection here at the hotel, but I can at least hear the stream.
Thank you so much.
I got a DS Lite I imported recently, and I'm loving it.
How is that?
That's great.
What makes it so much better than the original DS?
Well, I've never touched the original DS, so I like this, and it looked really cool.
I found it on eBay, and I blew away Scott and Lawrence, and I told them I got it for $99 off of eBay.
Wow.
They actually had this for their demo units for...
It was some really awful card game, but I have to say that I enjoyed the brighter screen on it.
It felt a little bit easier.
Yeah, that's right.
All right.
Well, SilentWind96, we'll see you in a little bit.
And you're getting the hookup, man, because this is an invite-only party tonight here.
In television.
The Mario Rock Opera is... Mario Rock Opera is setting up.
They've got a whole DJ thing down there.
Yeah, Supernova Sound.
In television everywhere, but there's new stuff too.
But, I mean, who doesn't love these classics?
It's great.
Get your butt down here right now.
1-866-880-0156 1-866-880-0156
And don't call in asking to get in free tonight because we just gave our one away.
So that's it.
We're done.
But here's the good news.
You can come Thursday or Friday and you can get in and it's a good time.
So if you still want to come down, Thursday and Friday we'll be here as well because we're taping both nights.
Where do we leave off?
Bobby, oh, Bobby's on the phone, so I'll go.
One thing I want to see tomorrow.
I didn't freaking touch the Wii, so I guess I'm going to have to wait in that.
You want to touch the Wii?
I want to touch Nintendo's Wii so bad.
So I'm going to wait in that horrible line and just...
Get it over with so I can say I played the damn Wii so I can come here and tell you all about it.
So that's essentially my day.
Otherwise, I didn't see anything in West Hall besides Sony.
And I know Tecmo's over there, and I know there's other booths over there I want to check out.
I would suggest going by Atlas for Disgaea 2 and Kalei, of course, for Guitar Man Lives.
I want to play their Fatal Inertia also.
Yeah.
Um...
Let's see, I'm going to go over to chat here and see what's going on here.
TigerClaw wants to know, are we going to be able to hear the Mario Rock Opera tonight as well?
I think unfortunately they don't because GamerAndy is going to be live somewhere else right at that moment, right?
Well, that was what that phone call was.
Oh, really?
They're not going to be live.
They cannot get it to work on Microsoft servers.
They're going to still record.
I apologize to all of GamerAndy's fans in chat.
Oh!
There are some in there, so all games interactive will be going on.
And they'll still have the show up on their podcast feed.
Well, okay, so the GamerAndy fans still have that.
Right, and GamerAndy will be here tomorrow night.
Nice guy, GamerAndy, and he's got quite a clique.
They've got eight people.
He's got a huge entourage.
GamerAndy.com And they've got the hookup.
They play Gears of War.
I was talking to Andy because they got behind closed doors at Microsoft and they played Gears of War and they said it was awesome.
I was there when they were getting it.
Yeah.
Major Nelson's on their show tonight, right?
I believe so, yeah.
And we were trying to rig it to get it to work and they just can't get it to work on their Wi-Fi over there.
Frickin' technology.
Yeah.
Alright.
Bobby, what are you looking forward to doing tomorrow at the show?
We...
Wee, that's all.
You're going to go wee, wee, wee all the way home?
No, just in the morning.
Just going to go over there and wait, whatever, the two hours.
You're going to go over and wee in West Hall in the morning?
Yeah.
Alright, yeah.
Yeah, I'm going directly there.
Right in the center of Nintendo's booth, I'm going to wee.
Yeah, I'm going to go play with my wee.
Because I really want to play the conducting game.
And that drum demo, you know, the virtual drum.
Because, I mean, I'm a musician, and I want to see if I'm any better at Miyamoto.
DarkSakura wants to address chat.
I didn't look too deep into the DS area, honestly.
So I will go hunt out anything on Fire Emblem tomorrow I can.
I know lots of people are interested in that series.
I love the series.
I can't play it for crap, but I love the series.
So I will look up Fire Emblem stuff for y'all tomorrow.
HitStun in chat right now is questioning is Super Smash Bros.
this new one a real game or was it just a whole fan service thing?
No, they have pictures from the conference.
With Miyamoto in the pictures?
Yeah, I would think it's real.
Oh, okay.
They say it in chat, I say it out loud.
You know, that's what we do.
They even have this cool little montage where Snake is talking to Ocelot or whatever, you know, whatever his name is.
Otacon.
Otacon.
See, listen, I don't play Metal Gear Solid, so that's why I'm going to butcher everything.
All I know is it's a game by a guy named Solid Snake, and that's as far as I go.
Folks in chat want to know about Excite Truck.
You guys saw it, I didn't.
What do you think about Excite Truck?
I want that game.
It looks like it scores like Burnout.
It's very interesting.
The truck is extremely fast, so it's kind of like Excite Bike a little bit.
Just very interesting.
I don't know, no one seemed to be able to keep their truck on the road, but it looked fun.
I like the way they do their scoring system.
It's kind of like Burnout, where you get points for, you know, driving dangerously, catching a lot of air, going fast, being in first place, and that stuff.
And they'll give you a ranking on the race, everything from, like, D to AAA, S, I don't know.
And they did say, though, that it wasn't, you weren't going to be able to do anything online with it.
It's kind of dumb.
I'm hoping that they have the whole, you know, build a level, save it, take it to your friend's house.
Nintendo needs to do online, dammit.
Get with the program.
They did have Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam there, and I didn't get to play that, or Tony Hawk's Project 8, which I have no idea what the hell Project 8 is, but, um, I don't know.
Should be good.
Project Hammer was another game that they had at the Wii booths, and, um,
I'm not very interested in that game, to be honest.
They had a Sonic game, though.
Sonic, uh... What was it?
Wildfire?
How was that?
I didn't play it.
It looked good, though.
What was it?
They had Bomberman.
and the Virtual Console.
Super Monkey Ball.
They had the Virtual Console.
The Virtual Console is sexy.
I want to see it all.
Tell me about Mario World.
Tell me about it.
How did it work?
How does it look?
Actually, I didn't get to check it out because I was feeling a little ill at the moment.
We will have hopefully some pictures online soon of the Virtual Console.
But in the meantime, if you are really trying to get a look at it, I believe Joystick had pictures of it online.
And I'm trying to find the link so we can put it in chat.
It looked pretty cool.
They had on demo, they actually had the Super Mario Bros.
for the Nintendo.
I think Mario 64 for the Nintendo 64, Bong for the TurboGrafx, Sonic for the Genesis, of course, and Super Nintendo.
They had Super Mario World.
Super Mario World.
So definitely really cool looking.
Yeah, it looks very solid, very sexy, very white.
Now, obviously this is not really great radio, but Rob, here's pictures of the virtual console on my laptop here.
Oh, that's pretty hot.
I like that.
Yeah, I do like that.
It's bigger than I thought.
It's on Engadget, guys, if you want to go there.
I thought it would have more games on the screen at once.
That's kind of interesting.
Yeah.
Real quick plug for the websites.
E3 on PSP.com.
Loki, you've been updating that like a mofo, right?
Uh-huh.
I've been trying.
I've been getting behind a little bit.
But I do have some stuff from actually the Nintendo party that I attended.
Oh!
Which should be good.
So we got some pictures of that.
Let's come back to that in a minute.
DarkSakura, what sites have you been working on?
Actually, I did a little blogging today on stuff.orangenilderadio.com.
Yeah, I have a backlog I'm going to post there soon, too.
I just happened to go up to the press room just to relax for a little bit and...
I figured I'd go ahead and update the stuff blog, so there's my initial impressions there.
That was everything up until I headed back, actually right before I ran into you guys, when I was coming out of the west.
I'm sorry I'm all backwards today.
I'm sorry.
So yeah, if you want to check out just what my impression was as of that moment, I have a few details there.
I had just also checked out Guitar Room Man at that point.
Also, there's a discussion going on in our LiveJournal community at...
Orange Challenge.livejournal.com You can get there.
I'm sure there's stuff going up on our MySpace.
I haven't looked at MySpace all week.
And there's various other discussions that we're involved with at different locations.
It just depends on...
We'll see you next time.
with G4 interviewing somebody in Kensho.
And we're like, is he that desperate for a paycheck?
I just rolled my eyes.
I'm just like, I don't get it.
I don't get G4 anymore, so whatever.
I saw him in South Hall.
They were making him record, I guess, a bumper or something.
He's all, I'm here at E3, man.
I was supposed to be in Alaska or something like that.
I was like, okay.
The last thing I saw him do that wasn't an animated movie was USA Up All Night.
Any other celebrity signings?
I don't know if this counts, but I got to meet Tommy Tallarico, thanks to Bobby.
And Becky Young, who's smoking.
Nice guy, but he had so much makeup on because he was doing the HD TV play.
Yeah, he did the HD, which is on VOOM, Dish Network.
He looked like, who's that guy on Dancing with the Stars?
George Hamilton?
No, I'm teasing.
He was a very nice... I'm totally teasing.
Very nice guy.
Glad to meet him.
Any other celebrity run-ins, you guys?
I got to meet... Well, I didn't get to meet him, but I saw the guy who worked on the...
DS, Castlemania Games, and then, as I'm actually showing Rob my picture right now, I had my meeting, well, not necessarily that I actually got to meet him other than to say thank you, but Koji Kondo, I got his autograph.
And I happened to be at the press line for Nintendo when they were doing an interview with Miyamoto.
You've got a lot of great pictures there, DarkSakura.
You've got to get those on the site soon.
I haven't figured out how to... Because I'm actually using my... No, no, no, I don't want to do that.
I'm actually using my camcorder as a camera, too.
And I'm trying to get the picture to show Rob.
There it is.
I got a really good picture of Miyamoto.
Go into chat room, chat.allgames.com for this week while we're live at the E3 Outpost.
Xander wants to know, did we see In The Groove 2 consumer style?
Conspicuously absent from Red Octane's booth completely.
All they have is Guitar Hero 2.
I'll give you this, their booth is 50 times better than it was last year, but it's all Guitar Hero 2.
They are not showing In The Groove in any capacity.
I didn't hear anything about the Activision deal either.
You know what?
You want to hear us?
I overheard Activision people talking about the acquisition.
As I was walking out of Kensha, I overheard Activision people talking about it.
And they were just saying, they were just very happy about it.
They were like, well, I'm glad we got them because someone was going to eventually, you know, it was basically the tone of the whole thing.
So I don't know if I was supposed to hear that, but I did.
Activision's very happy to be getting Red Octane, so...
Oh my god.
The puppies.
The puppies on IGN.com from Smash Brothers.
Oh my lord.
But I lost my train of thought.
It's alright.
Damn you for distracting me with puppy.
Sorry.
Just a quick programming note for those that are listening live.
If you're tuning in right now because you're expecting to hear Gamer Andy, unfortunately they're having technical difficulties, will not be able to do a live broadcast tonight.
He will be doing a podcast on his normal podcast stream.
So check that out.
However, All Games Interactive will be here live right after we wrap up in just a few minutes here.
And there might be OLR people on that too.
I've got to pee so bad.
Okay.
You know what's excellent about this?
IGN has a thing about Super Smash Bros.
Brawl in there.
And it says actually that the decision to include Solid Snake is basically from when Kojima actually begged to have the Metal Gear character in the last Smash Bros.
game.
They said when asked about the possibility of Sonic the Hedgehog appearing in the game as well...
I was always hoping that they'd have a fighting game including all the characters from different games
Well, the closest we had gotten before the Smash Brothers, well, there was Sonic the Fighters, which actually, you know, I didn't see that Sonic collection that they had last year, where they were supposed to have all the old Saturn Sonic games.
And all I've got to say is, if they make a new Kid Icarus game, that's going to look sweet.
Oh, yeah.
Wow, that looks great, Kid Icarus.
Wow.
I...
We transition.
Are we about ready to wrap up?
Your producer left.
It's all right.
I'll go run and find him.
Okay, thank you very much.
We can just stay here for a little bit longer and be the fabulous internet celebrities we are.
I didn't get to talk about the Nintendo party.
I just got a call on the bat phone, so I got to make this quick.
Okay, let's hear about the Nintendo party real quick, Logeeks.
Okay, so anyways, I went to the Nintendo Party, they had Black Eyed Peas playing, it was kind of interesting.
The only thing though is I missed the preview, so I didn't get to play games beforehand.
But what's even more interesting, on the way there, I saw a runaway bus smash through two cars and into a telephone pole, and then into a Rite Aid.
So that was pretty awesome.
Well, or, I don't know, brutal.
The party wasn't really my thing, because a lot of people I didn't know there, but all the big names, I guess, were there, even from Nintendo.
Of course, no one had a name badge or anything, so we didn't know who the hell was who.
All right.
Well, that's going to do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio, live at the E3 Outpost.
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought, DarkSakura.
I'd like to point out the funny deal that Captain N wasn't really a Nintendo character, and the show sucked.
So reject false icons.
Final thought, Loki.
Stay tuned on E3PSB.com or E3OnPSB.com and definitely going to have a lot more stuff on there.
I'm just kind of backlogged and getting everything on there.
Lots more videos and a lot more everything.
So keep watching.
Final thought, Mr. Bobby Blackwolf and plug your site already.
BobbyBlackwolfShow.com We're going to have our E3 show is Friday night, 8 p.m.,
Eastern, 5pm Pacific, right before OLR, but I hope all three of you at least show up for a couple minutes at least.
And actually, you guys should check out the Tuesday night episode of All Games Interactive.
It has both Sky and DarkSakura on it as well.
Good times.
Debating with Scott Rubin was a good time.
And you guys can do it again tonight after you pee.
I have got to wee in the worst way.
That's my final thought.
30 minutes.
Except for a Nutri-Grain bar that Rob gave me.
I haven't eaten since 10, so... I need to drink.
Alright, we're going to wrap it up here.
For those of you guys listening live, stay tuned.
All Games Interactive coming up in about 30 minutes.
For those of you guys listening on the podcast feed, thank you for supporting Internet Radio.
You guys are the best.
