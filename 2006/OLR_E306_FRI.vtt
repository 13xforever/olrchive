00:00.000 --> 00:28.000
We are live at the E3 Outpost for this Friday 2006 E3 edition.

00:28.000 --> 00:36.000
Welcome everybody to the Friday edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
We are here live at the E3 Outpost in West Los Angeles,

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
where we've been taping our post-E3 shows all week long.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Sky.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Joining me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Yo, what up?

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
And of course, Tech Massa Loki.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Hello.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
And moseying his way on over to a microphone there.

00:58.000 --> 01:06.000
Joining us for this last of our E3 shows is the one and only Bobby Blackwell,

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
who has no microphone right now.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
That's all right.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
We have mic troubles. That's all right. Live radio, boys and girls.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
I think...

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
It's coming.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
There you go. There you are. That's all right.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
And of course, once again, wave hello to producer Lawrence Young,

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
who's over there in the corner.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
God, I wish we could take him back to Sacramento with us.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
He's been awesome all week long.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
All right.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
Again, if you're downloading this podcast,

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
you've listened to us before,

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
but you're not sure why you're hearing all the background noise tonight.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
We're live. It's a big little party.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
A big little party.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
It's a little space, but it's a big party.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
And there's lots of people here, and they're playing games.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Like I see Soul Calibur. I can't tell if it's two or three.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
We have some Smash Brothers still going on.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
There's Smash Brothers. Everybody loves Smash Brothers.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
I see Halo down there.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Mario Kart Double Dash.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
I would think people would be sick of games by the end of this show.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Fight Night Round 3.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
I think they even had Rampage Soul Construction.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Oh, awesome.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
They have black going on on one of the TVs over there.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Sweet.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
I don't know about you guys, but I think I might be sick of games after today.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
No, I'm kidding. You know I'll go right back home and play games again,

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
but boy, overload.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
I was going to say, do you have a fever?

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Are you feeling okay?

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
No, it's great. It's exhausting.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
And I know a lot of people sitting at home

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
are probably screaming at me going,

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
Sky, you ungrateful bastard, at least you get to go to E3.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
Okay, yeah, trust me, I don't take that for granted.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
I'm very lucky to be able to go, but it is very tiring.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
And if you were here, you'd say the same thing.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
It's like, shit, I'm exhausted.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
You know, I'm craving some Ridge Racer 6

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
since they didn't have Ridge Racer 7 at PlayStation or Namco's booth this year,

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
except for a video.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
I know, kind of disappointing, huh?

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
I don't know why I'm craving it.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
I just need to play it.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
The craving is there. The itch is there.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
I'm craving tacos.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
Quick programming note, you guys, for you Orange Lounge Radio fans.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
There will be no live program this Sunday, which is Mother's Day.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
So spend some extra time with your mother

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
or, you know, motherly figure in your life,

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
the politically correct term there.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Or catch up on the free podcast that we had.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
There you go.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
Unfortunately, we've just, we got other stuff going on due to the holiday

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
and, you know, just the fact that we're driving home from E3 and all that.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
So we hope our listeners will understand,

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
but we'll be back, of course, our normal time next Sunday.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
We're just burnt out from the week.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
A little bit.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
A little bit.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
I plan on playing that new game, Extreme Nap Action.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
All right.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
I'm going to the chat room there over at www, I'm sorry,

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
chat.allgames.com tonight.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
I'm so used to plugging the other room.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Tonight, we're at chat.allgames.com.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
Next week, we'll be back to the Orange Lounge Radio chat

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
over at orangelaunchradio.com.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
You can always interact with us on our forums over there as well.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
Reading chat right now, let's see, jaded2006 says,

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
LOL, there are so many video games.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
How can you get sick of them?

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Exactly.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Get back and read the first part of your sentence and then ask that again.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
With so many video games comes so much walking

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
and so many lines, including those for food.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
So sorry to tell you.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
You know what?

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
What?

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
I actually didn't have a really long line for food.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
It was much better this year.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
It was only for coffee.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
We landed off to the expo.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
They did a much better job with food this year than last year.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
I think that was because of the Wii line and everybody was in that.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
The long lines were like for the grill and everything.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
I'm like sandwich, tuna.

04:25.000 --> 04:32.000
They had much more stuff set up outside this year,

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
which I thought was smart.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
They had the barbecue grills like you were kind of saying

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
and all that stuff.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
I think people started bringing food too, which is also smart.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
They had some really healthy selections this time around.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
I was very pleased because I don't do the meat thing.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
They had tuna.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Good to hear it.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
They had bagels and coffee.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
Lots of coffee for me this weekend, this week.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
Let's go around and play two interesting things tonight

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
because we have other topics we want to get to, so we can't do three.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
We're going to do two interesting things tonight.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
Dark Sakura, two interesting things you saw at the show today.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Start with one.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
I had it in my head and it was in that issue of EGM.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
I'd been reading down there and I completely forgot what it was.

05:10.000 --> 05:18.000
So I'm going to say X-Deal by NCSoft.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
That was very, very interesting.

05:20.000 --> 05:26.000
It's like virtual on, but a lot more and it's going to be a free game,

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
a free download, free game through PlayNC.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
I like free.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
My ears perk up when I hear free.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
They had a whole series of games.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
Dungeon Runner, there was Smash Star, which they're going to rename.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
It's already out in Korea.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
And Soccer Fury, which was very, very detailed.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
It was like hardcore beat everyone up soccer.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Very cool.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
So you can't beat the price of free.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
How did you enjoy the tour over there, that booth?

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
It was pretty cool.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
The Guild Wars room was actually sort of like maybe I should play Guild Wars.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
Because you bashed Guild Wars on this show before.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Not necessarily bashed.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
It just wasn't fun for me when I played it before.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
But actually better than that, I'm actually considering trying Tabula Rasa.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Very cool.

06:07.000 --> 06:13.000
Because I like the whole sci-fi, kill aliens, shoot things, fun.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
Guild Wars fans will be happy to hear the new expansions winning people over.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Loki, we're playing two interesting things.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
What's one of your two?

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
Oh man, you know, I've been so lazy today.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
You know, I know I played a lot of things today,

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
but I don't remember half the stuff I played.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
God.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
If you want to cheat, tell them something from Wednesday or Thursday

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
that we haven't talked about yet and they won't know the difference.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
I guess.

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
I played, was it, okay Spore.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Spore was, you know, huge.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
It was just an awesome looking game.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
And not really much more I can say.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
I mean, if you've watched the Game Developers Conference video of it,

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
it's basically that.

06:56.000 --> 07:04.000
It's just, it's one of those games where I'm just going to sit there and destroy everything.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
Create a race of vicious aliens that go and just decimate everything.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
That's what I'm doing with Spore.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
I loved Spore.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Loved it.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
I mean, I was surprised.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
I didn't know much about it going into the show today.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
I know there's a lot of buzz, but I'm only one guy.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
I can't follow everything.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
So I wanted to go see it because of the buzz.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
And even though we had a little problem at EA's booth trying to get in there,

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
but we won't go there,

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
we finally got into the Spore thing.

07:33.000 --> 07:39.000
It was much more than anyone could possibly expect.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
If you haven't been following this game, there is so much to it.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
And so much of it has to do with the user, the way you build things,

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
and the way people that you know and random strangers in the universe build things.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
It is so phenomenally impressive.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
This is going to be the next Sims, honestly.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Which is not surprising.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
I mean, it's Will Wright, but it's incredible.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
I would be very interested to see if something like this comes out on a console, too.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Because I know right now it's only PC, right?

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
It's just PC, but...

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
They're saying DS and PSP as well, but...

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
There was a job posting about porting Spore to the DS.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
It's kind of weird.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
I think it would be a bastardized version, though, like those Sims.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
It should really be on the 360,

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
or something that's really connected to the internet all the time.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Wow.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
The Wii.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
There you go.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
Bobby, what's one of two interesting things you saw today at E3?

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
This is going to be a surprising one,

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
because I'm sitting here, you know, Nintendo fanboy and stuff,

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
and really bashing on Sony.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
Interesting that I actually enjoyed Warhawk.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Really?

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
I actually played it, already to be able to be all bashing it and all that stuff.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
I was having fun!

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
So what exactly was the demo like? What did you do in the demo?

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Well, there was a single-player and a multi-player demo,

08:59.000 --> 09:04.000
but I did the single-player demo just because it was near the end of the show.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Essentially, you just flew around shooting planes,

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
and then you had to shoot down four frigates and stuff.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
The control scheme, it was no different for the people who were listening to radio.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
You can't see me doing this.

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
If you have ever made a plane with your hand and just flown around and made the noise...

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
We all did that as kids.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
That's what it felt like I was doing.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
That's how I was flying the plane.

09:24.000 --> 09:30.000
It's nothing like innovative or new or anything, but it was fun!

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
The graphics probably could have been better a little bit,

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
but the game was fun, and I was not expecting that going into it.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
That's great.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
The lines for Warhawk when I wanted to try and see it were really, really long,

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
so I didn't really get a chance to do it.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
Yeah, I waited until the end of the last day, and there were two people in front of me.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
I have to ask.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
The controller, how did that feel?

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
How was that tilt controller?

09:54.000 --> 10:01.000
It was very responsive on the movements for the plane, and it felt light.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
It's a little light controller, and it felt fine.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
It's just got some accelerometers in it.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
That's all that's really got.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Interesting.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
One interesting thing I saw today, or I should say one interesting experience,

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
was thanks to a listener of Orange Lounge Radio...

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
You guys rock.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
...I got to cut the Wii line.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Wii!

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Exactly, that's why I said Wii!

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
Justin from Vegas, if you're out there listening, I owe you my firstborn,

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
except I don't have a uterus, so I don't know how it's going to work.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
I owe you so big, thank you so much.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
It was totally a chance thing.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
We literally ran into each other, and he's like,

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
I'm going to go see the Wii, and I think I get to cut in line.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
You want to come with me?

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
I'm like, fuck yeah.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
We went over, and sure enough, he talked to his person.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
We were able to go in there. I was very happy.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
The downside to that is that once you get in there,

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
it's still a bitch to actually get to play any of the demos,

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
so we just got to cut that four-hour line to wait to get in there.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
We still had to wait in the lines once we got in there to play stuff.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
I will say, I thought, well, I guess that whole experience is interesting,

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
but while I have the Wii brought up, this is why I played.

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
I played Excite Truck, which I thought was more fun than it looked in the preview.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
I thought it was a fun time.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
The graphics are nothing to scream at, but all the games are widescreen,

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
which made me very happy, so that's good.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
It's a step up for Nintendo.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
Also WarioWare, which was great.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
It's a little tough at first because you have to keep changing the controller's positions,

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
but you get used to it, and I thought it was really cute.

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
I played the tennis thing as well, which I sucked at.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
Justin floored me on that game with my ass, but it was fun.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Did you get to play Zelda?

11:45.000 --> 11:51.000
No, lines were way too long, and I had to be back somewhere else.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
That's too bad. That was actually the only one I had any interest in playing,

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
and I got right up there. It was great.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Lucky you. Lucky you.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
I got right up there too, but I had a guy help me get up there too,

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
so we had the same experience on that one.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
All right, let's do one more interesting thing,

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
and then we'll get into some of the best and worst of E3,

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
like best booth, best games, all that good stuff.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Dark Soccer, one more interesting thing.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
I saw something that made me cry.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Okay.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
That Bomberman Zero thing.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Ah, Bomberman Zero.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
That was awful.

12:26.000 --> 12:32.000
I mean, yeah, it plays like Bomberman, but it's too hardcore looking.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Bomberman's supposed to be cute.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
I remember seeing those old Hudson Japanese commercials

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
where the person dressed up in the giant Bomberman suit

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
running all over the place being chased by the person in the other suit.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
Did you play the Bomberman game on the Wii?

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
No, I didn't get to.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
They had that thing tucked away in the corner.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
But that made me sad.

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
That took a piece of my childhood and destroyed it in front of me.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
It's like if they tried to do 3D Gem or something.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
That just broke my heart.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
All right.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
Loki, one more interesting thing you saw at E3 today.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
Elite Beat Agents.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
That game is awesome.

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
It's just really fun to play, and it's got a really crazy-ass storyline.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
This topic that came up on Bobby's show earlier,

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
for those that have no idea what the eff this game is,

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
what is this all about?

13:22.000 --> 13:27.000
Well, originally it came out as, I think, Ouiden in Japan.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
From what I gather, because I wasn't quite paying attention to the storyline,

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
trying to figure out how to play,

13:32.000 --> 13:38.000
there's these three guys that just come and basically fix situations.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
There was this guy, this girl babysitter,

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
who was trying to ask her boyfriend to go study with her.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
Then the mom comes and makes her babysit.

13:49.000 --> 13:54.000
So the Elite Beat Agents come to entertain the children to get them to go to bed.

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
And so it's got this art style and kind of a storyline,

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
almost like Phoenix Wright,

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
across with a little bit of Katamari.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
It's just really off the wall, but it's fun.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
It's easy. You just tap these circles on the bottom screen on the DS

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
with the beat of the music,

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
and there's a few other interactive things you can do with the touch screen,

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
but it goes all with the music, and it's really fun.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
It's definitely going to be one of those classic games,

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
kind of like Guitar Man and Luminous and all that stuff.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Really good music games.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
All right. Awesome.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
Joining us, taking Bobby's place momentarily, Sam.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Nobody can take Bobby's place.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Well, maybe two of me.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Oh, no, no. We love Bobby.

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
But he just did a live show from the Outpost,

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
which you can check out at AllGames.com.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
They're rebroadcasting a Sunday, right, I'm sure?

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
Your show will rebroadcast on Sunday, or will you be doing another show?

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
He's not going to do another show.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
No. He's done for the week.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
He's got a mom. He's got to visit.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
So say hello to Scott Rubin, who's joining us from AllGames Interactive,

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
which airs here on AllGames.

15:01.000 --> 15:06.000
Some of you guys might know Scott from his days at G4 Television.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
And you were on a show there, G4TV.com.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
Right. The show named after a website named after a TV show,

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
named after a TV network.

15:14.000 --> 15:19.000
The brilliant, genius mind behind that was actually the CEO of the network.

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
I wanted to call it AllGames something, and he was like,

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
no, why don't we name it after the website

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
so that we can promote the website on the show?

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
No hard feelings, though, right?

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
None. I actually saw him.

15:33.000 --> 15:38.000
I was at E3 on Thursday, sitting at the Sony booth,

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
getting ready to come here,

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
and one of the sales guys from G4 saw me and said,

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
hey, by the way, I just want to let you know, Charles is nearby.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Charles Hirschhorn together.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
And Charles, you know, whatever, he got the network up,

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
but he kind of ruined a lot of the fun, creative stuff that people wanted to do,

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
so it was a very awkward moment. I thought I'd share that with you.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
I'll say it, since I don't know if you can all say it.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
G4 went totally down the toilet.

16:01.000 --> 16:06.000
I mean, we get guys. What is that?

16:06.000 --> 16:14.000
We get guys is a slogan that used to be the main slogan for West Hollywood here in California.

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
And they still get guys, so G4 is hoping that some of that will rub off.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
Oh, well, more power to them. I don't know. We'll see.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
But as a gay guy who's been to West Hollywood,

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
I'll say still not interested.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
Still not interested.

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
They can't even win over the gays, so sorry.

16:32.000 --> 16:36.000
Anyway, no, seriously, though, Scott, we've been playing a game here,

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Interesting Things You Saw at E3.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
What was one interesting thing you saw at E3 today?

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Interesting Thing I Saw at E3.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
Interesting can be a game. It can be something you saw, anything.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
Well, I'll tell you, it is an interesting thing I see at every E3.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
I don't know if this is going to sound mean.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
I don't mean to make it sound mean,

16:52.000 --> 16:58.000
but it seems like if you're paralyzed or quadriplegic, you get into E3.

16:58.000 --> 17:03.000
I see lots of people in wheelchairs that are not moving a lot.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
They have almost no use of their arms and legs,

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
but I don't believe they work for retailers or the media,

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
but somehow they seem to get in.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
Some of them even look very young under the 18-age limit.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
But, see, now that could be like a make-a-wish thing or something.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
Yeah, no, I agree. You said something.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Okay, it is interesting.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
It's an interesting commentary.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Obviously, I'm not saying anything bad.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
In fact, some of my favorite moments have been at E3,

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
especially when I was on the air at G4,

17:32.000 --> 17:38.000
where I would be approached by a family member,

17:38.000 --> 17:43.000
and they would say to us that he watches the show all the time.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
He's a really big fan.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
Gaming, and I've always said this, gaming is the great equalizer

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
because when you play an online game from home,

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
it doesn't matter if you're black, white, old, young,

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
male, female, handicapped or not,

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
when you're in that game, nobody knows who you are

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
other than your actions in the game.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
I've always loved that about games,

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
that you could be anyone, literally, when you play games.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
So it's always nice to see people who love games

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
and can get a chance to get close to the industry like that

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
and see how they experience it.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
I mean, you guys have been to E3 before,

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
so you kind of take it for granted after a while,

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
but it is fascinating.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
I watched a couple of people come in just the past couple of days,

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
and their eyes light up as if they've entered Disneyland.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Oh, that was me the first year.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
I don't know, Dark Soccer, was that you the first year?

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
I had sort of an idea of what to expect

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
because my friend, who's another GameStop manager,

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
he brings us a video every year.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
So I sort of had an idea of what to expect,

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
but my first year, it's like going and seeing everything so big,

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
I was like, where to first?

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
Yeah, it's overwhelming the first year.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Which meant camping out at Konami for two hours.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
You've got to have a plan, I've found that.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
You've got to have a plan, you've got to have comfortable shoes.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Amen.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
And you've really got to have a plan.

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
Now, I have not been a part of your live broadcast before.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Sky refusing to look at chat,

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
he refuses to acknowledge the people in the chat room?

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Oh, no, they're there.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
I mean, they're just not saying anything interesting.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
And Loki, you also, you don't even bring chat up.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
No.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
Loki doesn't even, usually I do, but Loki hates chatters.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
He hates chatters.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
That's not quite an actual Wonder Woman outfit.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
That's not a Wonder Woman outfit?

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
Well, no, because Wonder Woman, that's a bikini.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
Oh, you know something, you're right.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
That could be the reason behind it all.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Yeah, that's why she got kicked out.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Wonder Woman had a full...

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Right, right.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
There you go.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Okay, you want to know why I'm not reading chat?

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
Here's the comment right now.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Who said Tommy Tallarico?

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
I think somebody's very confused about who's on the show right now.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
I have no idea.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
That's why I'm not reading chat.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
All right, well, you've actually got a good point there.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Now, what is it?

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Paris Hilton doesn't know the name of her own game?

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Yeah.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Loki, what is this?

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
It was funny because she showed up late yesterday

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
and she ended up calling her game, which I believe...

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
I don't even remember what it's called now, but...

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
I don't know.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
She called it, like, Diamond Quest or something,

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
and it's completely off of what the game is supposed to be.

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
Called Paris Hilton's Jewel Jam, and she called it Diamond Quest.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Yeah.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
Well...

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Who's expecting her to have a brain?

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Yeah.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
It's like she...

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
I don't even know what my game is called,

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
despite the fact that it's written right behind her.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Yeah, it's on the wall behind her.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
You're assuming she can read.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
It's also got her name in it,

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
so she went from calling it Paris Hilton's Jewel Jam

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
to just Diamond Quest.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Yeah, well, you know, that's what happens

20:35.000 --> 20:40.000
when you hire a dumb, blond millionaire to promote your game.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
You need to have someone poor and usually a gamer

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
if you want them to actually give credibility to your game.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
Yeah.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
I'm going to go ahead and try to wrap up

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
the two interesting things game.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
One more interesting thing I saw today,

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
and, boy, so much to see.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
What else would I say would be one more interesting thing?

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
Probably the use of Pac-Man arcade machines

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
to put the cell phone game in.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
I thought it was a very interesting use of...

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
It's almost vandalizing, a classic piece of machinery.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
But I suppose it's Namco.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
They can do what they want with it.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
That's true.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
As somebody who used to be a huge pinball fan,

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
I will give Namco this.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
I thought the baby Pac-Man machine being there.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
You know, baby Pac-Man was the Pac-Man game

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
that was half Pac-Man, half pinball.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Right.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
There will be pictures going up on our side of this machine.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
Dark Soccer loves this, too.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
We've been, like...

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
I've never got a chance to go back over there

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
and make an offer on it.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
We've been co-hunting for, like, a...

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
She'll actually be able to afford it,

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
but I've been secretly wanting a baby Pac-Man machine for forever.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
So it was kind of weird to see one there,

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
but you couldn't play it because they were advertising

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
the baby Pac-Man cell phone game on it.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
Ah.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
It actually wasn't even baby Pac-Man.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
It was just Pac-Man pinball, which wasn't all that great.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
I played quite a number of mobile phone games

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
over at Namco Mobile.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
All right, let's go to chat room

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
because now they're finally saying something interesting.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
You know I'm only giving you a hard time, Chad.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
You know I love you guys.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
If you want to join in, tonight we're in chat.allgames.com.

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
We are hijacking the All Games chat room

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
for our own evil purposes.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
CKY Mike says,

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
Sky, anything about Resident Evil 5?

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
I don't think...

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
It wasn't on the floor.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
I didn't see it.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Oh, yeah.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
It wasn't on the floor.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
I think there was a trailer,

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
but it was one of those...

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
It was like the Final Fantasy XIII trailer.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
What did that tell you besides,

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
hey, it's being made and it's coming to the system.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
That's it.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
There really wasn't a lot of news on Resident Evil 5.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Well, there was a ton of games last year, too,

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
that they were showing at Square Enix's booth

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
that we didn't even see this year.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
That's true.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
So they disappeared.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
Like what? Give us examples.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
I don't remember what they're called now.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
There's like a trilogy of games,

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
all of which I was not interested in.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
Then also Devil May Cry 4.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
I didn't see that at all.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
It wasn't even shown.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
What was really pissing me off

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
was the fact that Fatal Inertia wasn't on the floor

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
other than just video.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
Yeah.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Wow.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
All right.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
Let's go around and give out some awards.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
We're going to do our own personal assessments

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
for the best and worst of E3.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Scott, are you going to join in on us with this here?

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
Absolutely.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
All right. Here we go.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Best game of E3.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
I think last year we did two.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
We did a runner-up

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
and the best game that you played at E3.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
Using any criteria you want.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
Absolutely anything you want.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
And nobody can argue with you because it's your review.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
So anybody feeling brave that wants to start with a runner-up?

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
Dark Sakura.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
Oh, no. I don't know what my runner-up is right now.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Okay. All right. Loki, do you have one?

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
Yeah.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
You know, this one I actually didn't play

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
because it was only a video.

23:48.000 --> 23:53.000
But I'm going to have to go with Dead or Alive Extreme 2.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
And why is this?

23:56.000 --> 24:00.000
Because, sadly enough, I will probably buy that game.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
Because he likes the boobies.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
And I like the achievement points.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
And he likes the boobies.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
That's right. You're an achievement point whore.

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
Are you a fan of the Barbie dress-up mode, basically,

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
where you get to choose bikinis for the girls and all that stuff?

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
I just had to laugh at that game just by looking at it

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
because it's so blatantly...

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
It's like a Girls Gone Wild video.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
Literally, they have that new series of Girls Gone Wild videos

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
that you see late at night,

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
where they're making them do games.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
Well, that's basically this.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Okay.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
I would say my runner-up, I'll go next.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
My runner-up is Gears of War.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
I thought Gears of War looked fantabulous.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
What I also like about it is that it looks like they've designed it

24:42.000 --> 24:47.000
so any dummy can do cool moves in it, which I think is great.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Even though I'm not a huge shooter fan,

24:49.000 --> 24:54.000
I will go to that realm once in a while for a great, great shooter game like Halo.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
And I think Gears of War is going to be one of those great shooter games

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
if the demo is any indication.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
Plus, I love the way Microsoft had it set up, but I'll get into that later.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
So Dark Soccer, you got one?

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins on the PSP. Why?

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Because it's Ghosts and Goblins.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
I mean, that is like the peak of anything Capcom has out.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
I mean, I love the old games.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
And this does it so right.

25:19.000 --> 25:23.000
It takes the best elements from the early games,

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
touches them up, makes it look really clean,

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
takes a little advantage of the PSP's resolution.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
It was just really gorgeous. The play was great.

25:31.000 --> 25:36.000
They've added to it just enough to where it doesn't ruin it by overdoing it,

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
but it just touches it up a bit. It was very good.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
It was a very solid pla-

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
It's probably one of the first solid platformers I've seen in ages.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
Alright.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Like, since the days of Planilla.

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
Excellent. Alright. Well, congratulations to Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Dark Sakura chooses you.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
Scott!

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
I'm excited.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
You know, I've been sitting here kind of like rolling to my head, you know,

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
and most of my thoughts have been,

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
well, I do have a lot of most surprising,

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
like, surprise me good and most disappointing.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
But I'm gonna save those for my show.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
I'm gonna answer your question specifically.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Best of show, there's no question in my mind.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Wait, you gotta do runner up.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
Oh, geez.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Uh, oh, god.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Runner up?

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Uh, yeah.

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
You know what? I'm gonna say, for runner up, I'm gonna say Saints Row.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
Ah.

26:25.000 --> 26:30.000
This is a game that, obviously, without a Grand Theft Auto title on the Xbox 360,

26:30.000 --> 26:35.000
I'm looking for that kind of open-ended, hard-jacking, blow stuff up,

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
different kinds of weapons.

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
Obviously, what I like about Saints Row is that it goes another step further

26:40.000 --> 26:45.000
and allows me to create anybody I want to be the main character.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
And I really went for it.

26:46.000 --> 26:50.000
I got the spiky here, big fat guy, and I could run around the city like that.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
That's the one where you could be the girl or the guy, right?

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
I don't know if you could be the girl.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
It's basically a gang type.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
It's a THQ game.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
It was at the Microsoft booth, and then right across from Microsoft booth,

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
they had, like, three or four demo stations there.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
But it's, again, it's carjacking.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
It's very similar to Grand Theft Auto.

27:07.000 --> 27:12.000
It's made by Volition, the guys that did Red Faction and what was the other,

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Free Space, Descent Free Space.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
And it's well done.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
I was always concerned because every time we've seen footage for this game,

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
it's been choppy.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
The frame rate has been bad.

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
The word has been that it's not going to be ready, it's not going to be good,

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
and it's been delayed.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
But my time with it was fun.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
It definitely needs a little more work,

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
but I would say that is my runner-up for Best of Show.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
Awesome.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
All right.

27:37.000 --> 27:41.000
Best of Show, the best game, damn game at E3, period,

27:41.000 --> 27:45.000
using any criteria you want, Loki.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
This is tough.

27:46.000 --> 27:51.000
I know what you're going to say, so I'll have to say something else.

27:51.000 --> 27:56.000
Also, there's just too much good stuff at E3 this year,

27:56.000 --> 28:02.000
but if I had to pick one game, you know, Dead Rising, I love that game.

28:02.000 --> 28:07.000
And I think it's just one of those games that I'm going to be playing for hours,

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
and I've said that over and over.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
It's just very open-ended.

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
When you basically do anything, the game's only about three hours long,

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
but you can play it over and over and over and over again.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
Give us a brief description of the game

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
because I don't think it's been brought up on the podcast yet.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
Okay, well, Dead Rising basically is Dawn of the Dead, the game.

28:23.000 --> 28:27.000
You play a main character who is this photojournalist,

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
and you're stuck in a mall with a bunch of zombies,

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
but you can kill the zombies in any way possible,

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
anything that's anywhere in the game.

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
In stores, you can pick up any item and just use it as a weapon.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
There's like over 200 items.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
You can customize your character and the way he looks.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
You can rescue people.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
You take photos of stuff.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
It's just a really unique, different game.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
I love it.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
My Best in Show is one I think we've already talked about tonight,

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
but it stole the show for me.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
It's incredible.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
It's massive.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
It's spore.

28:59.000 --> 29:03.000
A game is phenomenal looking.

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
The only concern I have about it is I think it might be too much,

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
but the interactiveness, I love that stuff.

29:09.000 --> 29:13.000
I love the fact that what your friends do can screw up your world.

29:13.000 --> 29:17.000
I love the freedom to abduct aliens and then hurl them into space

29:17.000 --> 29:21.000
and watch them fall crashing down to earth in a bloody pulp.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
It looks like one of those games you're going to have the freedom

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
to do whatever you want.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
It's going to be incredible.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
Don't get me wrong.

29:27.000 --> 29:31.000
I love PC gaming, but I would love to see a game like this on 360 as well,

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
if it's possible.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
Maybe.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
I don't know.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
I just think it might be too massive for the confines of a console, though.

29:37.000 --> 29:42.000
So PC gamers, you really are getting a good one with this one, spore.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
Dark Sakura.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
I'm going to go with Zelda, honestly.

29:45.000 --> 29:49.000
I love the Zelda series, like almost every one of them,

29:49.000 --> 29:54.000
with the exception of Majora's Mask and Wind Waker.

29:54.000 --> 29:58.000
So this looked like it was really following directly in the footsteps

29:58.000 --> 30:07.000
of Ocarina of Time, which was probably one of my favorites in the series.

30:07.000 --> 30:12.000
Just having the Wii U-Con, or Wiimote.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
The Wiimote, as I call it.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
Yes, thank you.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
The Wii-Con, as I call it.

30:16.000 --> 30:20.000
You know, feeling the shake of the chain as you throw the claw hook,

30:20.000 --> 30:26.000
hearing it impact, you know, hearing the twang of your bow as it flies back.

30:26.000 --> 30:30.000
That is if you put the thing right by your ear.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
The control was a little bit interesting to get used to,

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
but other than that it was, and it really didn't look like it was touched up

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
much more than the GameCube, but honestly,

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
everyone who listens to our show knows about how much I give a damn

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
about the graphics, which is like hardly any.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
It was fun.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
It was a lot of fun.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
And probably the most fun of anything I played, you know,

30:51.000 --> 30:55.000
next to Ghosts and Goblins, so that gets it.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
Very neat.

30:56.000 --> 31:00.000
That's an interesting choice because Zelda was such a huge game

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
at last year's E3.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Was enough changed?

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
Is it worth the wait?

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
There was quite a bit changed.

31:06.000 --> 31:12.000
I didn't get to see the demo, but I had talked to plenty who did.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
You mean last year, right?

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
Last year.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
I had gone back and seen things later of it.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
It looks like they've really cleaned it up.

31:19.000 --> 31:24.000
I was actually just checking out that issue of EGM sitting over on the couch,

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
and they had a few side-by-side comparisons for The Twilight World,

31:28.000 --> 31:31.000
where they had it sort of a monochrome color before,

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
and now they've gone through and touched it up

31:33.000 --> 31:37.000
and added in different sort of ethereal effects to it,

31:37.000 --> 31:41.000
muted some of the colors, oversaturated some of the other colors

31:41.000 --> 31:45.000
to give it just a very alien feel when you're in The Twilight World.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
And the difference was great.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
I mean, of course, I didn't get to see any of The Twilight World,

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
but I got to see plenty of just the regular world.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
Everything had real depth to it.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Instead of just saying, oh, this is 3D,

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
you actually got a real sense of depth to it.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
I actually got a little motion sick.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
So that was good.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
All right.

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
Chat room wants to know, Derek H. is asking, is Scott asleep?

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
No, not at all.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
You've got to be an exhausted guy, though,

32:08.000 --> 32:12.000
with all this going on here at the E3 Outpost, which is awesome.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
This is a great idea, by the way.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
Thanks for having us.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
And the E3 and all that other stuff, it's got a long week.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
It's a little tiring, as you guys know.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
I mean, you did the same show I did,

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
and you've been here just as much as I have.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
So you're tired, too.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
But it's all good, because evening is over.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
But we get to leave tomorrow.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
We do get to leave tomorrow.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
All right.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Scott, your best of show.

32:32.000 --> 32:36.000
I think people are going to be surprised that I love Viva Pinata

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
as much as I do.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
Wow.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
No, I'm kidding.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
Oh, you bastard.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
You bastard.

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
You have me going for a minute.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
Not Viva Pinata.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Big shout out to Silent Wind there,

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
who has made the trek from Bakersfield.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
I tried my damnedest to get him into E3, and I could not do it.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
I'm very sorry about that, Silent Wind.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
No, there's no question in my mind.

32:58.000 --> 33:02.000
You've already said sport is the absolute best game at E3 this year.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Will Wright is a freaking genius.

33:04.000 --> 33:09.000
We went into that little room, and I thought I knew pretty much

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
everything there was to know about the game.

33:11.000 --> 33:15.000
I realized that all the creatures you find in the game

33:15.000 --> 33:20.000
have essentially been combined with a trading card element

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
so that you can print out these trading cards

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
and play like a Magic the Gathering type game with it

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
off the computer completely.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
Oh, I had heard.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
The stuff they want to do with it is phenomenal,

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
those things they were talking about.

33:31.000 --> 33:37.000
He also had inside the room creatures that were like action figures, statuettes,

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
and he made them with a 3D printer right from the game,

33:40.000 --> 33:44.000
which I believe will be possible, to print out your creatures that you create

33:44.000 --> 33:48.000
and make them into figurines that you can have in your room.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
The Orange Lounge, when Loki and I went there,

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
we aren't cool enough to have Will Wright demo it himself for us,

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
so we got some other girl, but she was good.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
We missed out on it.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
You went into the little room?

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
Yeah.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
I was surprised.

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
I was expecting it to be one of Will's minions, a little sim maybe.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
We got a minion.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
Oh, it was great.

34:07.000 --> 34:13.000
I mean, he only showed the kind of third level and space level.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
You didn't get to see the kind of amoebic level.

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
But what I think is so phenomenal about this, and you talked about it,

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
sharing the content, you know, anyone who knows SimCity

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
and the Sims knows that there is, like he says,

34:24.000 --> 34:28.000
10% of the people who buy those games that make their own stuff,

34:28.000 --> 34:32.000
and of that 10%, there's probably 10% of that that's actually really good.

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
The fact that instead of having to go to the website,

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
look through all the stuff and find it,

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
he's taking the best stuff and seeding it into the world on his own,

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
to me, is the most significant step,

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
because as you're playing the game,

34:45.000 --> 34:49.000
it becomes populated by all this great content,

34:49.000 --> 34:53.000
and so you encounter this creature, you attack this creature,

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
you can see who made it, find more of the creatures they've made,

34:56.000 --> 35:01.000
and then the ability to go from amoeba to galactic outside,

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
millions of planets.

35:03.000 --> 35:06.000
And when you think about how many units of Sims sold,

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
and how many units of Spore will sell,

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
a lot of game developers will say,

35:10.000 --> 35:13.000
well, our community will be so big, we'll have so much content,

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
and usually there's nothing good.

35:14.000 --> 35:17.000
You know that a well-right game will get the audience,

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
it'll get the customers, and it'll get the creativity,

35:19.000 --> 35:25.000
and I think we're going to be playing just an incalculable amount

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
of creative characters and creatures in this game.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
You know, when I was sitting there watching the demo,

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
I was almost saying, this is too good to be true, this is too ambitious.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
But then I remember, oh yeah, there's like 20 Sims Expansions packs,

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
so, you know, anything's possible.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Yeah, and I do believe that you're right,

35:40.000 --> 35:44.000
it is kind of so big that maybe people won't be able to kind of get through it,

35:44.000 --> 35:47.000
and won't be able to get to all elements of it.

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
But that's kind of what I like about this game,

35:50.000 --> 35:53.000
is that it is very open and sandboxy,

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
so you can just play around and create stuff,

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
you can play around in any of the levels,

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
but if you're a hardcore gamer,

35:59.000 --> 36:03.000
and you're looking for the more than eight-hour black game experience,

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
you know, Spore will deliver probably,

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
it'll be on the World of Warcraft scale of gameplay.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
I have no doubt it'll do well.

36:12.000 --> 36:16.000
And if it doesn't do well, there's something wrong with the gaming community.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
The only, you know, hint that it might not do well,

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
is you can look at Sims Online and say,

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
well, that was a well-right game, and it didn't do well, so.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
Yeah, I guess.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
But Sims Online was a dumb idea.

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
Sims Online just turned into Vegas, it was a bunch of hookers and drugs,

36:29.000 --> 36:33.000
you know, there's just a couple key things that were wrong with it, unfortunately.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
Anyway, let's keep it moving.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Worst game of the show.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Worst game of the show.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
Anybody want to start off? Loki?

36:42.000 --> 36:47.000
You know, I almost want to say Africa.

36:47.000 --> 36:51.000
But, since I didn't get to play it,

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
I didn't really get to play this game either,

36:54.000 --> 36:58.000
I think it's a stupid idea for a game.

36:58.000 --> 37:02.000
The Eye of Judgment.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
Worst game ever.

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
And the reason why is because it's not really a game,

37:06.000 --> 37:10.000
and the fact that it reminds me of something that you would create

37:10.000 --> 37:13.000
to kind of enhance a Magic the Gathering tournament.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Like something to throw on the TV,

37:15.000 --> 37:19.000
if you were going to broadcast a Magic the Gathering tournament type thing.

37:19.000 --> 37:22.000
That's about as useful as it is.

37:22.000 --> 37:26.000
The fact that you have to remember to remove cards from the playing field

37:26.000 --> 37:32.000
so that the PlayStation doesn't accidentally spawn the creature again is stupid.

37:32.000 --> 37:38.000
My worst game of the show would be found over at 2K Games, this booth.

37:38.000 --> 37:44.000
It's the new Family Feud game coming to, what, I think PlayStation 2.

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
And while granted there might be a market for the Family Feud game,

37:47.000 --> 37:50.000
I had the Family Feud game on the Commodore 64,

37:50.000 --> 37:53.000
and not a goddamn thing has changed.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Why would we need this?

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
This is so, I don't know.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
The survey says you're right.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
74% said you are correct, it's the worst game of the show.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
Survey says this game sucks.

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
And the hosts have changed so many times.

38:07.000 --> 38:10.000
I mean, if you're going to bring me a Family Feud game,

38:10.000 --> 38:14.000
at least give me Richard Dawson trying to make out with the chicks.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
They're all on that show.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
At least give me that.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Who's the host? The guy that committed suicide?

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
No, some random guy.

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
I know on the real TV show, I think it's the guy from Home Improvement,

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
but I guess they couldn't get his likeness for the game.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Too expensive, I bet. His license is huge.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
What a piece of poop.

38:31.000 --> 38:35.000
And to think, that game was next to Dora the Explorer,

38:35.000 --> 38:38.000
and I still named Family Feud.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
All right, Dark Sakura, worst freaking game at E3.

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
Sonic the Hedgehog.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
Which one?

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
The PS3 one.

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
Oh, Team Sonic rolling over.

38:50.000 --> 38:54.000
And she is such a Sega fangirl that there must be some atrocities.

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
The control. The game was pretty.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
And I mean, it was really, really pretty,

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
except for some of the jaggies on the PS3.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
But you know, even the Xbox 360 one,

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
because I did go back and check that out,

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
the control was utter crap.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
You turn it just, you know,

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
the best controlling version of Sonic Adventure was on the Dreamcast.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
It was smooth, it was...

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
Why couldn't they have taken a page from the Dreamcast?

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
You know, they do it right.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
They have it to where if you just

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
go a little bit to the left, drop the cliff.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
And then on top of that, they have them,

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
the angle that they have them fall at,

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
you can see that the platform that you've been standing on

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
is just floating in the air.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
He just falls into nothingness.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
And as like, if they're at least going to do that,

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
have it from an overhead angle, you know,

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
and have them fade out, you know.

39:40.000 --> 39:44.000
So, I could see there were a few collision detection issues.

39:44.000 --> 39:49.000
The thing is, is that they can do a good Sonic game.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
I mean, I played Sonic Rivals, that was fun.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
But I have to call it the worst game

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
if they take something that I adore so much

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
and make utter crap out of it.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
All right.

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
So, it gets worst game on control alone.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
I'm sorry to hear it. All right, Scott.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
So am I.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
Worst freaking game at E3.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
This time I'm not kidding when I say

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
people will be surprised when they hear me say this.

40:12.000 --> 40:16.000
Madden for the PlayStation 3 was the worst game that I played at E3.

40:16.000 --> 40:20.000
I have to tell you, if you're a PlayStation guy, girl,

40:20.000 --> 40:23.000
and you're expecting to pick up a PS3 at launch,

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
and you're like Madden,

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
get ready to go through what we went through last year

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
with the Xbox 360 version.

40:29.000 --> 40:33.000
From the words of an EA Sports employee,

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
the game will not work right.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
They're just saying they haven't had enough time.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
It's going to be just like the 360.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
They still don't have final dev kits.

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
Madden has been completely rebuilt.

40:44.000 --> 40:48.000
And when you rebuild and you try to let people in the house

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
you're rebuilding before it's done,

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
it's going to feel like it's not done.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
And Madden on the 360 wasn't done.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
He acknowledged that.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
He said, you know, you're right, it was broken.

40:57.000 --> 41:00.000
And he said it's going to be the same way this year.

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
And I would have thought all the work they did

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
since the release of the 360 version

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
would have carried over to the PS3.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
But unfortunately, no.

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
The best thing about Madden really

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
is they've got 3D grass for the first time.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
So if you're excited about 3D grass,

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
you'll be happy with the new Madden.

41:17.000 --> 41:20.000
But otherwise, PS3 Madden,

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
it was the worst thing I've played.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
It was a joke.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
Wow, that's, wow.

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
Now we don't talk a lot about sports games on this show,

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
but even the...

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
You're allergic, right?

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
No, I mean, I like Blades of Steel.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
Okay.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
I like Tank Metal.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
I like NBA Jam.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
Those are good games.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
Here's the thing, though.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
What I'm curious about,

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
even the non-sports games fans

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
are interested in Madden on the Wii.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
I'm curious, what are your thoughts,

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
sports game fan of Madden on the Wii?

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
Well, I'll tell you,

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
all the sports games on the Wii

41:50.000 --> 41:53.000
are going to benefit from the fact that

41:53.000 --> 41:56.000
we've been pushing buttons for sports games for years.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
And I found the novelty

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
of using the controllers really enjoyable.

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
I found it to be a new challenge in the game.

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
Instead of just adding a vision cone to a game,

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
I found throwing the ball,

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
like using the motion of throwing a ball,

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
was really kind of cool,

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
and it really appealed to me.

42:15.000 --> 42:19.000
I think that they've just kind of begun to tip the iceberg

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
of what's possible

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
in terms of unique gameplay elements

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
with this special controller.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
And I have to say,

42:26.000 --> 42:29.000
I was surprised that it didn't feel cheesy, gimmicky,

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
even at this early stage.

42:31.000 --> 42:35.000
I think graphically it'll be able to be decent enough

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
that it won't be a disappointment to people

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
who are kind of used to the graphics they have.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
But I have to tell you,

42:41.000 --> 42:45.000
I think that if you can lock in the Wii controller

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
into the kind of sports games we're used to,

42:48.000 --> 42:51.000
whether it be hockey from the guys at 2K Sports,

42:51.000 --> 42:56.000
or baseball from the guys at 2K, or EA even,

42:56.000 --> 42:59.000
and what I'd really like to see is a boxing game use the Wii,

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
I think people who are sports fans

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
are going to be ready to make this jump.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
Because, let's face it,

43:05.000 --> 43:09.000
for years we've been playing sports games the exact same way.

43:09.000 --> 43:13.000
And just watching the guy play baseball with the Wii controller,

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
it made me excited.

43:14.000 --> 43:17.000
Graphically, I think the Nintendo sports games,

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
they need to evolve a little.

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
I'm a little tired of these cutesy little Japanese characters

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
for my baseball games and my tennis games.

43:24.000 --> 43:28.000
I'd like to see some realistic players here in 2006.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
But the Miyamoto in tennis was hilarious.

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
You have to admit it.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
Oh, the faces.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
That was the best part of the press conference.

43:34.000 --> 43:39.000
Reggie Fils-Aime, Iwata, and Shigeru Miyamoto

43:39.000 --> 43:42.000
on the faces of those characters.

43:42.000 --> 43:45.000
Clearly the show-stealer at the Nintendo press conference.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
Way too cute.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
That was pretty adorable.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
Let's go around.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Best booth, worst.

43:50.000 --> 43:53.000
Well, let's start with best booth using any criteria you want.

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
Best booth using any criteria you want.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
It can be designed, it can be what was in it,

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
it can be the way the staff treated you.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
Any criteria you want.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
Loki.

44:03.000 --> 44:06.000
I would have to say Sega's booth was probably the best booth

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
that I played at, at least.

44:08.000 --> 44:12.000
I like flat-out, or not flat-out, full-auto, too.

44:12.000 --> 44:17.000
And I love being able to play multiplayer in ChromeHounds.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
So I think they had a really good setup.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
The videos were everywhere.

44:21.000 --> 44:25.000
So I liked it, and they were giving away lots of stuff.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
So yeah.

44:27.000 --> 44:30.000
Dark Sakura, best booth at E3?

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
Uh...

44:33.000 --> 44:37.000
I'm really not sure, because I wasn't particularly wowed.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
I guess I'm going to, even though I really disliked their layout,

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
I'd go with Nintendo.

44:41.000 --> 44:45.000
Just because it was pretty.

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
And I did like how they had the...

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
You know, I'm actually going to strike that back.

44:50.000 --> 44:53.000
I'm going to say the PSP area for Sony.

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
Okay, so like the PSP booth?

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
I liked the couches.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
You could sit down, and your feet were like,

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
I'm sitting down.

44:59.000 --> 45:02.000
You know what, the way you played those PSP demos was very interesting.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
I know.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
That's how I sit on my couch and play, sort of half sideways.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
But I thought that it was a neat...

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
It was easy to get to everything.

45:09.000 --> 45:13.000
You were crowded, like a bunch of rats in a cage.

45:13.000 --> 45:16.000
It was just all like, I've got room to breathe.

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
I can sit down.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
This is a fabulous idea.

45:19.000 --> 45:22.000
So yeah, I'm going to actually go with Sony,

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
for just the PSP area.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
All right.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
Best booth for me.

45:26.000 --> 45:29.000
I can't believe I'm about to say this.

45:29.000 --> 45:33.000
Because three years ago, this would never...

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
Best and this company would have never come out of my mouth.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
But times have changed so much,

45:38.000 --> 45:43.000
and this year's E3 proved that Microsoft has got the best booth to show.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
I would agree with it.

45:45.000 --> 45:49.000
Microsoft is in such an interesting position right now,

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
because they do have a year ahead.

45:51.000 --> 45:57.000
And every problem I had with the Xbox, they got it this time.

45:57.000 --> 46:00.000
There is something for the role-playing fans.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
Enchanted Arms looks great.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
There is something for the cutesy people.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Viva Pinata.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
Well, okay, maybe there'll be something else next year.

46:08.000 --> 46:12.000
There is something for sports people, action people.

46:12.000 --> 46:17.000
And the way the booth was laid out was smart.

46:17.000 --> 46:20.000
Their demonstration was inside a little room.

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
The Gears of War thing, where the floor vibrated.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
You got your ticket, you came back.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
I'm sorry, you put headphones on.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
I'm just so excited.

46:29.000 --> 46:34.000
But Microsoft, the people would come up and talk to you.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
Did not judge you based on your credentials.

46:36.000 --> 46:39.000
Were happy and excited to tell you about the game.

46:39.000 --> 46:43.000
I'm so surprised at how far Microsoft has come.

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
By far and above the best booth in E3 2016.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
I actually do have to agree with you there,

46:47.000 --> 46:51.000
because I was impressed with the area they had laid out for DDR.

46:51.000 --> 46:55.000
They gave you enough space to play that you're not face-up in front of the TV.

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
They sure did.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
And also, Matt was actually pretty...

46:58.000 --> 47:03.000
At the end of the show, they had these people walking around taking photos

47:03.000 --> 47:07.000
and attaching it like little Polaroids and attaching it in a frame.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
I talked to one of the girls over there.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
She was just as friendly as she could be.

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
She said, oh yeah, Method Man just came by here

47:13.000 --> 47:17.000
and talking about how some of the less savory people there.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
We both agreed that we just like Pierce Hilton.

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
And now the chat room is getting a little angsty at me naming Microsoft,

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
because I think there's a lot of people still in that area

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
where they don't want to go over the Microsoft products yet,

47:28.000 --> 47:32.000
because Microsoft hasn't done enough outside the realm of sports

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
and driving and stuff that's won them over yet.

47:34.000 --> 47:37.000
I'm telling you guys, they're on the right path.

47:37.000 --> 47:41.000
And don't get me wrong, there's even nice things about the PlayStation 3

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
and of course about the Wii.

47:43.000 --> 47:47.000
But Microsoft is really in a good position right now,

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
and the booth itself was great.

47:49.000 --> 47:53.000
It was not packed like it was a couple of years ago,

47:53.000 --> 47:57.000
because they were more intelligent about where they put everything.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
So it was easier to access things.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
Just on all those levels, I'm considering it.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
It's just great.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
Scott. Oh, Scott took his headphones off.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
I'm sorry, are you on your way out?

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
No, no, I just got an emergency phone call

48:09.000 --> 48:13.000
just to tell me that they love the show.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Oh, thank you.

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
They were just calling in, they said,

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
I love the show that you guys are doing, keep it up.

48:18.000 --> 48:22.000
Thank you, whoever that was, hello and thank you, appreciate it.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
They're enjoying it.

48:23.000 --> 48:26.000
All right, best freaking booth at E3.

48:26.000 --> 48:29.000
I agree, Microsoft's booth was very good.

48:29.000 --> 48:35.000
But it is, to me, hard to deny what EA is able to put together each year.

48:35.000 --> 48:41.000
It's more about that Thunderdome and the way they put together that video.

48:41.000 --> 48:45.000
It is kind of a lot of responsibility to be the first thing people see

48:45.000 --> 48:48.000
when they walk into the big south hall.

48:48.000 --> 48:53.000
And I think that EA, over the years, has evolved that booth.

48:53.000 --> 48:57.000
It's very easy to see all of their games on display.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
There's some stuff behind closed doors,

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
but the way it's set up with that circular movie room

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
so you can see all the movies,

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
game stations all on the inside,

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
a lot of playable stuff right on the inside.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
And then outside on that outer perimeter,

49:09.000 --> 49:13.000
again, very big, clear game stations.

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
For example, Superman today,

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
I was expecting not to be able to get any kind of demo,

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
but I stood there, watched him give a great demo to one person,

49:20.000 --> 49:24.000
then he left and I got to get up close and ask a lot of questions.

49:24.000 --> 49:27.000
And I just think that they've designed it really well.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
It's clean, the way it's laid out.

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
I went into the little private area room with the NFL Network

49:32.000 --> 49:36.000
and even back there, it was very nice.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
The people were friendly,

49:38.000 --> 49:41.000
and I just found that to be a good job.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
And for God's sake, it better be.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
They've got all the money in the world,

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
they've got a lot of big AAA titles,

49:46.000 --> 49:49.000
and they've got the best spot in the entire show,

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
better than even the big three.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
So I have to say, I thought the EA booth...

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
Now, I did want to jump quickly back to your earlier question

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
about most surprising,

49:58.000 --> 50:05.000
because I remembered something that's right up the OLR alley in Kensha Hall.

50:05.000 --> 50:10.000
I was checking out the Novant controller,

50:10.000 --> 50:15.000
but across from them was a booth showing off

50:15.000 --> 50:19.000
the world's first massively multiplayer DDR game.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
I thought that was interesting.

50:21.000 --> 50:24.000
I mean, it's too bad I couldn't understand it

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
because it was all in different language.

50:26.000 --> 50:29.000
But I looked at it and I went, hmm, that's interesting.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
I mean, I was shocked.

50:31.000 --> 50:36.000
I was like, wow, there are people dancing together online all over the world.

50:36.000 --> 50:40.000
I thought that was kind of shocking, surprising, and weird.

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
All right.

50:41.000 --> 50:44.000
We've got to move it really quickly through these last couple topics

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
because we've got to make way for All Games Interactive,

50:46.000 --> 50:47.000
which is coming up next, correct?

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
It is.

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
All right.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Well, let's real quickly, worst booth and why.

50:51.000 --> 50:54.000
Worst booth?

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
That's really hard for me to say

50:56.000 --> 51:01.000
because honestly the worst booth as far as its showing went

51:01.000 --> 51:08.000
was I was really underwhelmed also by the PS3 area.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
Sony overall gets best and worst.

51:10.000 --> 51:11.000
Okay.

51:11.000 --> 51:15.000
They get best for layout, worst for games.

51:15.000 --> 51:20.000
I mean, true, they did have Tekken and Ghosts and Goblins,

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
but when you went up to the PS3 area,

51:22.000 --> 51:27.000
I was surrounded by so much crap that it literally stank

51:27.000 --> 51:28.000
and I had to get out of there.

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
All right.

51:29.000 --> 51:30.000
Loki, worst booth?

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
Nintendo.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
Why?

51:32.000 --> 51:35.000
Nintendo's booth, you had to wait in a four-hour line

51:35.000 --> 51:39.000
to get into another booth to where you'd wait another hour to play a game.

51:39.000 --> 51:44.000
So it was a line to wait in another line to wait to play some games,

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
which were just tech demos,

51:46.000 --> 51:49.000
and then the jackasses that were working on the demos there,

51:49.000 --> 51:53.000
five minutes made quick, that type of stuff.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
It was just very hurried.

51:54.000 --> 51:57.000
They let people in, people weren't leaving,

51:57.000 --> 52:02.000
so there's hundreds of people moshed in there like a club or something.

52:02.000 --> 52:05.000
It just wasn't very conducive to being able to play the games.

52:05.000 --> 52:08.000
The DS stations, as Bobby mentioned earlier,

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
none of the games were marked with what games they were.

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
You had to actually look over people's shoulders to see what they were playing,

52:14.000 --> 52:15.000
which was stupid.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
No GameCube games on the floor,

52:17.000 --> 52:20.000
including the fact that they announced a couple games,

52:20.000 --> 52:25.000
like the new Paper Mario game, which I wanted to play.

52:25.000 --> 52:26.000
What else could be wrong?

52:26.000 --> 52:29.000
No Game Boy Advance, but I don't really miss that.

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
One booth had Game Boy Advance games.

52:30.000 --> 52:33.000
That was SNK, which was like one game.

52:33.000 --> 52:36.000
But not even Nintendo was showing it, so let's do that.

52:36.000 --> 52:39.000
I actually am really surprised that you said they were being rude

52:39.000 --> 52:42.000
because the people I dealt with at Nintendo were nothing but brilliantly nice.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
Actually, I had really nice people too.

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
That girl got me a Koji Kono's autograph,

52:47.000 --> 52:50.000
and then the guy who was there at Zelda,

52:50.000 --> 52:54.000
he was all helping me out with some of the controls until I got used to it.

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
We were just talking about old games and everything.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
It was great. He was a really nice guy.

52:59.000 --> 53:03.000
The one I was talking about in particular was the Red Steel demo.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
It was a shift change.

53:05.000 --> 53:08.000
The guy before him was letting these people play for 15 minutes each,

53:08.000 --> 53:11.000
and then when I got up there, he was like, okay, five minutes, make it quick.

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
Wow.

53:12.000 --> 53:15.000
I would also say Nintendo was the worst booth at E3,

53:15.000 --> 53:18.000
and don't get me wrong, I love the Wii.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
I mean, I'm going to buy the Wii.

53:20.000 --> 53:23.000
I think it's awesome, but the design of the booth was shit

53:23.000 --> 53:27.000
because when they did the DS, it was so much better.

53:27.000 --> 53:30.000
You go in, they show the preview.

53:30.000 --> 53:34.000
They have a set amount of time that you get to spend with the demos,

53:34.000 --> 53:37.000
and there's incentive to go back through

53:37.000 --> 53:40.000
because you may get to go to the demo room that has even more demos.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
It was much smarter made that year.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
I'm pissed that they didn't show anything on GameCube

53:44.000 --> 53:47.000
because that Super Paper Mario, whatever it was, looks awesome,

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
and it's a crime that that wasn't on the floor.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
It's sad that they're ignoring the advance

53:52.000 --> 53:55.000
when they were pushing the micro so hard last year.

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
Nintendo made some...

53:56.000 --> 53:59.000
Whoever designed Nintendo's booth should be fired for E307.

53:59.000 --> 54:02.000
Bring back the old booth. Honestly, it was better.

54:02.000 --> 54:06.000
And it's sad I'm making that judgment, not even based on the content.

54:06.000 --> 54:09.000
And the fact that I dealt with some very nice people at Nintendo, it's too bad,

54:09.000 --> 54:12.000
but the booth design cannot be ignored.

54:12.000 --> 54:15.000
It was a horrible way to show the Wii.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Scott, worst booth.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
Let's see, worst booth.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
There's so many to choose from.

54:21.000 --> 54:24.000
It's very difficult because I found a lot of these booths

54:24.000 --> 54:28.000
to be poorly designed, poorly laid out,

54:28.000 --> 54:32.000
poor choice of costume people.

54:32.000 --> 54:37.000
You know, I think I'm going to say...

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
I'm going to say, I'm going to agree with you guys

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
that Nintendo was poorly designed.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
I think they were in a tough position

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
because they knew everyone that goes to E307.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
There's no way you leave E307

54:47.000 --> 54:50.000
without having to at least try to try the Wii

54:50.000 --> 54:55.000
because there's only, what, PC, PlayStation, Nintendo, and Microsoft,

54:55.000 --> 54:58.000
and if you were to go back and people would say,

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
wow, you heard about this crazy controller, did you play it?

55:00.000 --> 55:03.000
And you said, no, you're kind of a loser.

55:03.000 --> 55:06.000
And the fact that they made it so difficult

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
and the fact that they didn't show a lot of the stuff

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
that people wanted to see,

55:10.000 --> 55:14.000
yeah, I mean, you've got to say boo to Nintendo.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
Boo.

55:16.000 --> 55:19.000
Sorry, you know, I still consider myself a Nintendo fanboy.

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
Well, really, I'm a gaming fanboy. I like them all.

55:21.000 --> 55:25.000
But Nintendo, that booth design, fire the architect.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
Fire him.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
Bobby wanted to interject something real quick.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Did anybody here say LucasArts?

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
Oh, no.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
That's my runner-up.

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
That's my runner-up.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
What are you hiding, LucasArts?

55:39.000 --> 55:42.000
Who kept their booth closed for two days, then opened it up with a line.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
Two and a half days.

55:44.000 --> 55:48.000
They opened it up at noon today, then it was a line.

55:48.000 --> 55:51.000
Who cares about LucasArts after that point?

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
It looked like it was a museum in there,

55:53.000 --> 55:57.000
which means it was nothing more than a George Lucas ego inflation thing.

55:57.000 --> 56:00.000
Yeah, but they had a video of people that worked there going,

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
the next generation...

56:02.000 --> 56:05.000
What was the line? There was something about...

56:05.000 --> 56:08.000
We will make the next generation game.

56:08.000 --> 56:11.000
No, the video wall when you're walking towards West Hall.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
Well, why don't you make it outside where we can see it?

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
Does that mean they haven't done crap yet?

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
Yeah, they always do that.

56:18.000 --> 56:21.000
That's an elitist mentality, and that's LucasArts.

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
I actually have a category I'd like to ask everyone about.

56:24.000 --> 56:28.000
Really quick, what was the most bizarre thing you saw?

56:28.000 --> 56:32.000
The line of people to see Paris Hilton, get out of my E3.

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
Get out. What are you people doing there?

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
It is not a celebrity gawk fest.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
Loki?

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
The strangest thing I saw...

56:40.000 --> 56:43.000
I would have to say, because there wasn't too much weird stuff,

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
but at the very end as we were walking out,

56:46.000 --> 56:50.000
there was some impromptu dance party going on in the Engage booth,

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
and I don't know what that was about.

56:52.000 --> 56:53.000
That was horrible.

56:53.000 --> 56:56.000
Despite the fact I bashed on the Engage an awful lot,

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
their booth was actually pretty slick.

56:58.000 --> 57:01.000
I couldn't go in. It was almost like I was Superman and it was Kryptonite.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
I would try to walk towards the Engage booth,

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
and I physically was pushed backwards.

57:05.000 --> 57:08.000
I used it to cut through to get around the massive Konami,

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
people watching the Metal Gear Solid 4 trailer.

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
But you know what? The booth design was slick.

57:12.000 --> 57:16.000
I still hate the Engage, but the design is slick.

57:16.000 --> 57:17.000
They tried to sell it really well.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
You're reminding me too much of the Apple Store.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Alright, you.

57:21.000 --> 57:24.000
My most bizarre thing was WTF.

57:24.000 --> 57:27.000
Oh, yeah, the work task fund or whatever.

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
Work time fund.

57:29.000 --> 57:33.000
That's just because it's something really bizarre about cutting a rabbit in half

57:33.000 --> 57:36.000
and then having this old lady bring out incense and start praying

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
and getting paid for it.

57:38.000 --> 57:39.000
Alright.

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
Scott, really quickly, you got one you want to add?

57:41.000 --> 57:44.000
Okay, my weird thing was two things.

57:44.000 --> 57:48.000
One, those stupid inflatable rafts people were wearing on the back.

57:48.000 --> 57:54.000
To see people in suits walking around with webs and inflatable rafts on their back,

57:54.000 --> 57:59.000
I just wanted to push them so that they'd fall and bounce and bounce back up.

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
I just wanted to do that all day.

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
Worst giveaway I've ever seen.

58:03.000 --> 58:09.000
And the other thing is these hordes of people that stand in line for ridiculous things.

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
Now, okay, I like Adam West.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
I just don't understand wasting.

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
The show is three days.

58:15.000 --> 58:18.000
Two and three quarters because the last day is short.

58:18.000 --> 58:22.000
Why are people spending their time waiting in lines,

58:22.000 --> 58:27.000
A, to see old celebrities or even like a Paris Hilton, like you said,

58:27.000 --> 58:35.000
and B, to get a small little trinket of something that you will probably lose very quickly

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
or never use in your life.

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
If it's something cool, I'm all about it.

58:39.000 --> 58:44.000
But I see people waiting as though they're going to receive communion from the pope or something.

58:44.000 --> 58:47.000
It's just very, very bizarre.

58:47.000 --> 58:53.000
Along the same lines, why do they go stand behind G4's booth to try and get on TV?

58:53.000 --> 58:56.000
Like every day we were leaving, we'd see this crowd of people going,

58:56.000 --> 58:59.000
And just to let you in on a little secret, I actually walked by and went,

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
Boo!

59:01.000 --> 59:02.000
I mean, it's just weird.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
I'm petty, I'm sorry.

59:04.000 --> 59:08.000
You know I don't like the direction that channel went into.

59:08.000 --> 59:15.000
Why are people going to the G4 booth at E3 to watch coverage of E3?

59:15.000 --> 59:18.000
I know, I know. Anyway, we've got to wrap it up.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Thank you guys. This was a great show.

59:20.000 --> 59:23.000
Scott Rubin, thank you so much for joining us on tonight's program.

59:23.000 --> 59:27.000
You guys are welcome back here anytime, any day.

59:27.000 --> 59:30.000
It's been a pleasure to have. It's been a lot of fun.

59:30.000 --> 59:33.000
And like I said to you earlier before the show,

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
anybody who's got a passion for gaming,

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
and you guys have been doing this show so long,

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
it's a real testament to your passion for gaming,

59:39.000 --> 59:42.000
and your audience is a lucky group of people,

59:42.000 --> 59:46.000
and I'm glad the All Games crew has had a chance to experience OLR live from E3.

59:46.000 --> 59:47.000
Thank you.

59:47.000 --> 59:48.000
And you know what, Scott?

59:48.000 --> 59:49.000
Thank you so much.

59:49.000 --> 59:52.000
You know, I would have never thought having four years ago

59:52.000 --> 59:57.000
that we would be sitting here with somebody who has been to the ends of gaming media,

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
you know, on the TV and stuff.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
This is surreal.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Thank you so much for having us.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
This is awesome.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Thanks for coming.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
All right.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Bobby, thank you so much for being here as well.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
We appreciate it, your three days of hard work on the program.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Yeah, well, no, actually, and what I wanted to say is, you know,

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
that I really appreciate being here.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
A lot of your people listening probably don't know.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000
I was listening to Orange Lounge Radio before they started podcasting.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.000
I had listened to some of their live shows before the whole podcasting fact,

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000
and then I was listening to their podcast before I was doing a show.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.000
So for me as a fan, it's been a thrill to be able to be up here with the guys.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000
A lot of listeners probably would kill to have, you know,

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000
be able to sit at least for one show.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000
I got two.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
I got two shows with the OLR guys.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.000
So thank you, and thank you to the OLR chatters for welcoming me and the family.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
It was kind of really weird today when people were asking me,

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
please be on the show again today.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Move to Sacramento.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000
We'll talk about it.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000
All right.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000
All right.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Thank you.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
I really would like to thank our OLR me for showing up in force.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Yeah, you guys are awesome.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000
I was very impressed to see so many people.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000
And it was cool to meet some of you at E3 also.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Yeah, I met up with a few people.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000
And Justin.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Oh, my gosh.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Oh, my gosh, Justin.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000
You don't even know how bad I owe you.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Bandit in chat says, support all games.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Kill G4, damn posers.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Interesting comment.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000
You know what?

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000
If you want the real gaming media, you're going to have to go to the internet.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000
I agree with that.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
All right.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Let's wrap it up.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Final, final thoughts.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Final thoughts of E3.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Scott, do you want to get indulged with the final thought?

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Final thoughts of E3, you know, every year we get very excited looking up to it.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:44.000
I think this year, because it is a transition year, I think I'm so shocked at how disappointing

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Sony's showing was that I almost don't feel the same as I ever have, believing in E3 before.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Obviously, those movies last year left us on such a high point.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
We couldn't believe it.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Is it real?

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Is it real?

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.000
In this year, the reality feels like a really wet towel smacking me in the face.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:07.000
But being a guy that went out and got a 360, it just kind of shows that sometimes when

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:12.000
you are there on day one to adopt a new technology, it pays off in the end.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
And so I'm glad I have a next-gen system.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000
I don't feel like I got burnt.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.000
And hopefully Sony will surprise us when they release this machine in November.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000
All right.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Bobby, final thought.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
I'm ready to go home.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Loki, final thought.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Man, this is weird.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:33.000
I don't really want to leave here, because I swear, having come here like every day this

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000
week, it feels like a second home almost.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
It's just, I don't know.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000
I need more plasma screens in my house, I think.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Your new wife missed you.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000
That was the first thing we did when we moved into our house.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
I haven't seen this kind of emotion from him all week.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000
I know.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000
This is crazy.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
All right.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Well, I'm sorry.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000
I've been kind of buried in a laptop all week.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000
You really have.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.000
But E3 on PSP, how's that been?

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.000
A success?

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Did you call it a success?

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
It's as good as one person can do, so.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000
There you go.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Maybe next year we'll have a set.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Next year you'll have a bigger crew.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000
All right.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000
My final thought, and then we'll let Dark Sakura go.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.000
My final thought would be, I was dissing on the chat room earlier, but secretly, I love

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000
you guys.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000
You guys are the reason why we do this show.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000
I mean, not just chatters, but listeners in general.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000
I mean, just the feedback and the positive support we've gotten is just amazing.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
So, thank you so much.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000
And that's that.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000
We'll see you at E307.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Dark Sakura.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Rejects false icons.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Say no to Sony.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
All right.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Wow.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000
That's some harsh words.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000
I don't know.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.000
I don't hate Sony, but we'll get into that on another show.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.000
But not next week.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000
No OLR this Sunday.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
We will be back next Sunday.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000
For those of you guys listening live, stay tuned for All Games Interactive.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000
They're up next.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:49.000
For those of you guys listening on the podcast, we will be back the week after Sunday.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000
And say hello to your mother or your motherly figure for us.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000
We are out.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Goodbye, E3.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Goodbye.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000
