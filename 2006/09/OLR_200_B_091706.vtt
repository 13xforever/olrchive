00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:20.000 --> 00:26.000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on this lovely Sunday evening, September the 17th of 2006.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
It is our 200th episode tonight, so it's a little bit crazy, but that's alright.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
What else can we do here to celebrate of our 200th episode?

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
We have a little cake during the break.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
Thank you, Chris, for bringing the chocolate cake.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
I'm filled with chocolatey goodness now. It's great.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
But we're going to get back into what we do well here.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
It is some gaming news.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
Loki, start us off.

00:45.000 --> 00:52.000
Yes, and as we talked about in Part A about the Wii being region-free or not being region-free, we still don't know.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
There is rumors that the PlayStation 3 may be region-free, and there might be confirmation on that.

00:58.000 --> 01:06.000
According to a Resistance Fall of Man video interview posted on GameVideos, the PlayStation 3 may indeed be region-free.

01:06.000 --> 01:15.000
And basically the kind of proof for that is that they're talking about multiple versions of the game,

01:15.000 --> 01:22.000
all the videos being put in there in both the high-def formats, including PAL, on one disc.

01:22.000 --> 01:30.000
So people are kind of assuming, okay, so there's going to be one run of the game that's going to be throughout the world.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
So maybe kind of some proof that there might be some region-free games.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
I think, if anything, it's going to be like the 360, whereas some games are region-free.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
If the developers want them, some games aren't.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
I think that's probably what you're going to see.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
Interesting. I don't know. I would hope that the PS3 would be region-free,

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
but that would be kind of a new thing for Sony, because PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 1 definitely weren't.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
But PlayStation 1 was pretty easy to get around it.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
PlayStation 2 took a little while, but now you can get around it.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
But I have a Japanese PlayStation 2 just because I had to have those imports,

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
and I did not want to fuck up my original PlayStation 2.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
I have a first-model JPS2. It still works, actually.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
But there's no way I'm getting a JPS3. Too much money.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
I'll just have to wait. Forget the imports. I'll just have to live without it.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
Anyway, another thing people have been curious about PlayStation 3 is what is really their answer to Xbox Live.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
One interesting piece of speculation came up this week.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
XFire, a possible team-up with the popular PC messaging program XFire.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
I'm an XFire user, and I think it's awesome, because I could be playing World of Warcraft

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
and message somebody who's playing Call of Duty or something else a completely different game.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
I think the concept behind XFire is awesome.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
Even if MTV does own it, it doesn't matter. I think it's a great system.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
I would be very excited to see something like this come to PlayStation 3.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
There was a quote this week.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
I believe it was 1UP reporting from a transcript of Viacom's report.

02:54.000 --> 03:00.000
Quote, importantly, XFire just signed a deal with Sony to create a version of their platform for the new PlayStation 3,

03:00.000 --> 03:06.000
which will now enable XFire to extend its reach further into the huge console gaming market.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
And they're saying that Untold Legends Dark Kingdom, which was a PS3 launch exclusive,

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
was in XFire's PC initialization file.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
Now, after this story sat on the Internet for a couple days before you folks in the chat room start yelling at us

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
and telling us, you know, wait a minute, wait a minute.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
Yes, we do know little news came out a little later that says,

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
actually, Sony doesn't plan to be fully integrating XFire right here.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
This was just for this one game.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
But you know what? I still find this partnership to be very interesting nonetheless.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
What do you guys think? I mean, Loki, you know a lot about XFire. Do you use it at all?

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Nope.

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
Oh, well then, what do you think about teaming up with the PC based?

03:42.000 --> 03:49.000
Well, might as well, since Sony doesn't seem to know what the, you know, their ass from their foot as far as online, you know, services go.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
Well, how do you know they don't have something already and they just haven't said anything yet?

03:52.000 --> 03:58.000
Because their whole answer is like, yes, our services will be exactly what Xbox Live is.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
So, you know, since they can't really innovate on that, I guess.

04:01.000 --> 04:10.000
I don't know. They haven't really said anything about it and the fact that there's a lack of information about what they're providing on their online service makes me think, hmm,

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
they don't know what they're providing on their online service yet.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
They don't have a plan whatsoever.

04:16.000 --> 04:23.000
So I'm sure, you know, we're going to hear more about their online service and about their games at Tokyo Game Show in a few weeks.

04:23.000 --> 04:29.000
But until then, I don't think they know shit about their online service right now.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
And I think it's just kind of pieced together.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
And I think you just said what exactly is going to prove your statement wrong, Tokyo Game Show.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
I think our answers are, we're going to get the answers to our questions there.

04:37.000 --> 04:45.000
Well, until then, I still think that they, their online services very pieced together and I don't know.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
It doesn't sound very good so far.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Jamie, any thoughts from you?

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
I know you don't really do a lot of PC gaming, but...

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
I have AIM.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Well, X-Fire's kind of like it in a way.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
I have AIM.

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
What if PlayStation 3 had AIM on it? Would that be cool?

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
I probably wouldn't use it on there because I'd be too busy playing a game.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Ooh.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
All right. Good thought, I guess.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Anyways, yeah.

05:12.000 --> 05:19.000
So, speaking of the PlayStation 3, we know that they're, of course, coming out with two different versions of the PlayStation 3,

05:19.000 --> 05:25.000
a premium and I guess a core version, you know, if you want to use the Xbox 360 analogy.

05:25.000 --> 05:37.000
The rumored ratio of these is supposed to be 80% of the premium, 20% core because, you know, they really want to push that, you know, $600 model.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
So, you're going to be seeing most of these coming out, you know, in the more expensive bundle,

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
but I think a lot of people are going to be getting the more expensive one anyway.

05:44.000 --> 05:51.000
It's kind of like how with the Xbox 360, sure, they had the core one available, but people only bought it because the premium was sold out.

05:51.000 --> 05:58.000
So, I guess that's their way of making more money off of this or losing less money, I guess.

05:58.000 --> 06:04.000
Well, I was kind of bitter when the only Xbox 360 I could get was a core because they were making, like, it seemed like half and half.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
So, I think they know the more people want the premiums because the cores are kind of a joke, just like they were a 360 in my opinion.

06:09.000 --> 06:16.000
And to be honest, there's going to be shortages because they're only going to have, you know, what, 400,000 units to launch with the United States or North America.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
Well, I ain't buying one until at least 2007, so there you go.

06:20.000 --> 06:26.000
You know what, at least with the Wii, you know, they're promising 4 million units by the end of the year, most of which are coming to the United States.

06:26.000 --> 06:33.000
Well, I hope they make good on that or else, you know, it better not be the 360 all over again. So, we'll see.

06:33.000 --> 06:43.000
Well, in other news, this actually has to do with the Xbox 360 and some UK news.

06:43.000 --> 06:51.000
There is going to be a free week of Xbox Live for our friends overseas.

06:51.000 --> 07:05.000
It's stating that you'll actually be able to use the services starting on 20th November.

07:05.000 --> 07:15.000
Hey!

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
That's a different song.

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
Excuse me. I'll ferret you.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
It's not my fault you can't tell your September from your November, okay?

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
I'm going to throw my hat at you.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
If only Nintendo would make that mistake.

07:31.000 --> 07:43.000
Back to the news. On the 20th September, Xbox Live will be free to our friends in Europe.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
Free access. And it ends on the 29th.

07:47.000 --> 07:53.000
Actually, it will be at 11.59pm. I think that's UK time.

07:53.000 --> 08:01.000
So, get in all that laggy, scramble Xbox Live action while you can because I played it online and it's laggy.

08:01.000 --> 08:06.000
Well, some of the games are available right now just to give a list.

08:06.000 --> 08:15.000
Project Gotham Racing 3, Top Spin, 2, Table Tennis, Saints Row, World Cup Soccer, Dark Zero.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
I'm sorry, Perfect Dark Zero, Street Fighter 2, Hyper Fighting Edition, Texas Hold'em.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
Hey, you know what? Log on and play Uno with us.

08:24.000 --> 08:31.000
Maybe we could do it. That would be a good way for us to meet some UK listeners except one of us is going to have to be awake at a god-awful hour for that to happen.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Unless we do it on a weekend.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Give it a weekend.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
No, we could be up at like 11am. They could be at 7 o'clock at night or something.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
With the vision camera.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
Oh yeah, that's right. We're going to have a vision camera soon, so that would be fun.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
We could moon our UK listeners. Wouldn't that be exciting?

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
No.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
No, I'm sure they'd love that.

08:46.000 --> 08:53.000
We'll have to learn what the proper root gestures are in British English.

08:53.000 --> 09:00.000
Anyways, speaking of lame ideas, you know, rare.

09:00.000 --> 09:09.000
Rare, of course, was responsible for a lot of the launch titles, or a couple of launch titles, I should say, for the Xbox 360.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Actually, no, I take that back. There's only one title.

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
Anyways, they had a launch title for the 360, Perfect Dark Zero.

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
And now, of course, I'm going to be announcing some more titles at X06, which is later this month.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
Including, well, some thoughts at least.

09:24.000 --> 09:31.000
Banjo 3 or Killer Instinct are some of the thoughts that may be the announcement.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
I think it's probably a new IP.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Or maybe a Perfect Dark where you can jump.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
That'd be nice.

09:37.000 --> 09:44.000
But anyways, more news to come, of course, once X06 takes place in Barcelona.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
So, look forward to that.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
Now they're all cursing each other in UNO speak in our chat room.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
We're cursing each other in British English.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Draw four, bitch.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
No, a little bit different.

09:55.000 --> 10:01.000
Black Wolf is saying, skip four, you tit.

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
And he also said, draw four, you bloody bloke.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
That was my worst British accent ever, by the way.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Sorry, I won't do that again.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Sorry, UK folks. I apologize.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
I apologize to the entire United Kingdom.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Oh, that's right.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
I knew it was a couple, and I have to go and correct myself again.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Moving on to another story.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
Final Fantasy XII, something about the current gen systems.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
I know we've had a lot of next gen news, but something about the current gen systems.

10:30.000 --> 10:35.000
They're actually going to be having a whole day to celebrate Final Fantasy XII in New York City.

10:35.000 --> 10:42.000
And what's going on is that on October 12th through October 15th at the Digital Life Expo,

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
Final Fantasy XII will be appearing at the event.

10:46.000 --> 10:51.000
Very cool, and I know we have a lot of fans there at New York City that want to check that out.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
However, here's the other part you should check out.

10:53.000 --> 10:59.000
October 11th is Final Fantasy XII day, and that has been declared by New York City.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
There will be a special commemoration in Times Square.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
Cosplayers will be abounding, I'm sure.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
I don't see why people are making such a big deal out of something that's such a crap game.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
You haven't even played it yet, have you?

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
Yes, I have.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
It's incredible.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
The demo?

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
It's going to be incredible.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
I know. I want to play my game by myself.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
Well, we'll just see when the full version comes out.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
We will just see.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
I'm still going to get it.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Yes, you see, fangirl.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
I'm using Megzi's excuse.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
Metal box.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Special edition.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Oh, special stuff.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Alright.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
Anyway.

11:41.000 --> 11:48.000
Well, one thing that I think a lot of us will be happy about, especially a certain somebody sitting by my foot,

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
is Kingdom Hearts 2 is getting an international version in Japan.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
We're getting Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix,

11:54.000 --> 11:59.000
which a couple of us who pay attention to our live journals have seen pictures of because somebody posted

11:59.000 --> 12:10.000
a scan from a magazine of a certain somebody who was in a mask in the bonus clip for Kingdom Hearts 2.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
Oh, so this game will actually have an ending that makes sense?

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
It made sense.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
I'm just messing.

12:17.000 --> 12:22.000
But from what that picture indicated, it's going to give us more of that little clip because

12:22.000 --> 12:28.000
I don't care if I'm spoiling now, but if you get the perfect ending for Kingdom Hearts 2,

12:28.000 --> 12:33.000
you get a little clip of three armored figures picking up key blades.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
YouTube is amazing.

12:34.000 --> 12:40.000
And there are, there's like a bajillion other key blades, like a graveyard around them.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
And apparently they're going to have more of that in the ending.

12:44.000 --> 12:49.000
You know how there was the deep dive in the last Kingdom Hearts.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
But they're also saying that they're going to be incorporating the card battle,

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
the card battle system from Chain of Memories.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
It didn't give a lot of detail.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Again, I saw the ad for this.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
I've seen the article.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
They showed it like, they actually showed, I think, the Sephiroth battle on this picture.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
And I'll have to find out who it was on my friends list that posted the article.

13:10.000 --> 13:18.000
But it had the little card icons in the side and you draw your cards and play them out like Chain of Memories.

13:18.000 --> 13:23.000
But it looked really neat.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
Another point is that they are getting all the English voices.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
So, hey, importers, be happy.

13:30.000 --> 13:35.000
You, too, can own this game and play it in an understandable language.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
Unless you are fluent in Japanese and then you won't have a problem anyway.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Yay, Japanese.

13:41.000 --> 13:47.000
Anyways, speaking of stuff coming out in Japan, well, this is more, of course, for the U.S.

13:47.000 --> 13:52.000
We have some release dates for you, including the stuff that's coming out this week.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
And lots of good stuff, of course.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
My favorites being on the PlayStation 2.

13:57.000 --> 14:02.000
Okami is going to be finally making its way out here, you know, very anticipated.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
It's about fucking time.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
Exactly.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
We're also going to be getting...

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
I will talk with my mouth full whenever I want.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
I am one of the hosts of this podcast, goddammit.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Okie dokie.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
Sorry, I was yelling at Chris for trying to be my mommy.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Ok.

14:18.000 --> 14:24.000
No, we're going to be getting some other stuff, including, well, some stuff for the Game Boy

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Advance.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Bratz Forever Diamonds, which is also actually...

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Actually, I take that back.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
It's not coming out in the Game Boy Advance that week.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
That would be in October.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
This is incorrect.

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Red Rescue Team and also Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Blue Rescue Team,

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
which is coming out in the DS will be making their way this week.

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
Open Seasons, pretty much on every single console, including the 360.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
Why you would buy that one, I don't know.

14:48.000 --> 14:53.000
Dragon Quest Heroes Rocket Slime is going to be making its way to the DS, which is pretty

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
awesome.

14:54.000 --> 14:58.000
If you're a fan of Sierra games, there's going to be some PC compilations coming out for

14:58.000 --> 15:03.000
you, including the King's Quest compilation, Leisure Suit Larry compilation, Police Quest,

15:03.000 --> 15:08.000
Space Quest, and yeah, those would be the compilations for you.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Hot!

15:09.000 --> 15:13.760
Samurai Warriors 2 on the 360 and PlayStation 2 are going to be coming out.

15:13.760 --> 15:18.200
If you have some stuff for the 360, you're looking to pick up some games, well, The Godfather

15:18.200 --> 15:22.160
is going to be coming out for you, as well as, well, not really a game, but the Xbox

15:22.160 --> 15:26.360
Live Vision camera, as we mentioned earlier.

15:26.360 --> 15:27.360
Let's see here.

15:27.360 --> 15:34.440
World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions, which is also on PSP and PlayStation 2.

15:34.440 --> 15:37.440
I might pick this up because it looks funny.

15:37.440 --> 15:45.400
Cabela's Alaskan Adventure, all that ice fishing and hunting polar bears on HD there.

15:45.400 --> 15:49.480
And then, no Africa on the ice, okay.

15:49.480 --> 15:55.040
And then finally, on the Game Boy Advance Capcom Classics mini-mix will be making its

15:55.040 --> 15:56.240
way out there.

15:56.240 --> 15:59.920
And if you really buy everything for the Game Boy Advance, Fashion Dogs, where you can dress

15:59.920 --> 16:02.600
up dogs on the Game Boy Advance.

16:02.600 --> 16:05.560
There are people who do that for real, though, that's sad.

16:05.560 --> 16:09.200
And if you're one of those people, never mind.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.160
Please stop listening to OLR.

16:11.160 --> 16:15.960
Oh, King of Fighters 2006, I'm sorry, was also making its way in Godfather Mob Wars.

16:15.960 --> 16:16.960
Much better.

16:16.960 --> 16:23.920
Well, as for our friends overseas in Europe, by the way, Suikoden 5 came out yesterday,

16:23.920 --> 16:24.920
so get it.

16:24.920 --> 16:30.180
But on the 21st, Jaws Unleashed, yay.

16:30.180 --> 16:34.400
And then on the 22nd, FIFA 07 is coming out for everything.

16:34.400 --> 16:35.400
And I'm not kidding.

16:35.400 --> 16:40.120
FIFA is coming out for damn near everything, including, you know, Nintendo Virtual Boy.

16:40.120 --> 16:41.120
I'm kidding.

16:41.120 --> 16:46.720
I have a Virtual Boy.

16:46.720 --> 16:48.400
How can you still play your Virtual Boy?

16:48.400 --> 16:51.880
Isn't that just the biggest migraine maker ever?

16:51.880 --> 16:53.400
And I like it.

16:53.400 --> 16:56.160
I still play Teleroboxer, damn it.

16:56.160 --> 16:57.160
Freak.

16:57.160 --> 17:03.200
Anyway, also coming out is Guilty Gear Dust Strikers for the DS.

17:03.200 --> 17:06.720
Jaws Unleashed on the Xbox, which I don't know why it's not coming out on the 21st with

17:06.720 --> 17:09.600
the other versions.

17:09.600 --> 17:17.680
Just Cause on Xbox 360, NHL Eastside Hockey Manager 2007 on PC, PyroWorld on PC, and Saint

17:17.680 --> 17:21.000
Seiya the Hades on PlayStation 2.

17:21.000 --> 17:26.400
I'm glad you get it as Saint Seiya, not as, like, Warriors of the Zodiac, which is stupid.

17:26.400 --> 17:27.400
All right.

17:27.400 --> 17:30.720
Well, let's take a look at some release dates coming to Japan.

17:30.720 --> 17:33.740
September 19th, you're getting Chaos Wars.

17:33.740 --> 17:38.800
And then September 21st, you're getting an RPG made by Koei for the PlayStation 2 called

17:38.800 --> 17:43.000
Harukanaro Jiku no Kare Mai Ichiya.

17:43.000 --> 17:47.300
And then you're also getting NHL 06 and Rugby 06 coming out from Electronic Arts over there

17:47.300 --> 17:48.520
in Japan.

17:48.520 --> 17:52.960
And something I thought was very interesting also coming out on the 21st, the Game Center

17:52.960 --> 17:55.840
of USA Midway Arcade Treasures.

17:55.840 --> 17:57.240
Yes, this is a version.

17:57.240 --> 18:02.400
It's a port of Midway Arcade Treasures Volume 1, it looks like, coming out on the PlayStation

18:02.400 --> 18:04.440
2 translated into Japanese.

18:04.440 --> 18:07.400
So I guess it's a way for them to play some of the games that were really big here in

18:07.400 --> 18:08.720
America years ago.

18:08.720 --> 18:13.480
So that's kind of neat to see a four-year-old game getting translated for a Japanese audience.

18:13.480 --> 18:15.920
I think a lot of them were already out in Japan, though.

18:15.920 --> 18:16.920
Probably.

18:16.920 --> 18:17.920
Well, yeah.

18:17.920 --> 18:18.920
Especially in arcade format.

18:18.920 --> 18:22.320
But some of the games, I kind of see, because not all the games that were popular here were

18:22.320 --> 18:23.720
popular there and so on.

18:23.720 --> 18:26.760
Like I imagine Mortal Kombat was probably bigger here than it was there.

18:26.760 --> 18:27.760
I don't know.

18:27.760 --> 18:31.360
I mean, I wasn't in Japan in the mid-90s, so I don't know.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.520
But that's what you have to look forward to this week.

18:33.520 --> 18:34.520
Hmm.

18:34.520 --> 18:35.520
Excellent.

18:35.520 --> 18:40.420
Anyways, speaking of stuff that we could be looking forward to, SNK is actually trying

18:40.420 --> 18:44.840
to make a comeback in the arcades with brand new hardware.

18:44.840 --> 18:45.840
And they're going to be showing...

18:45.840 --> 18:46.840
Wait a minute, though.

18:46.840 --> 18:47.840
Wait a minute, though.

18:47.840 --> 18:50.640
Remember when they tried the 64?

18:50.640 --> 18:53.360
When have you ever seen an SNK machine at an arcade?

18:53.360 --> 18:59.720
I always see these SNK machines at frickin' pizza parlors, and I saw one at the supermarket

18:59.720 --> 19:01.840
and one at Jim Boy's Tacos, okay?

19:01.840 --> 19:06.120
We had a six-slot MVS at my arcade.

19:06.120 --> 19:09.000
Those SNK machines show up in the craziest fuckin' places.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.160
And we had one of the big-screen TV ones for Samurai Shadow 3.

19:12.160 --> 19:13.160
I saw one in a 7-Eleven.

19:13.160 --> 19:16.240
However, Samurai Shadow 4 has a signal that resets those TVs.

19:16.240 --> 19:17.240
It turns them off.

19:17.240 --> 19:18.240
I'm sorry.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.640
Did you have a story?

19:20.640 --> 19:27.800
At the 44th amusement machine show in Japan, they were showing off...

19:27.800 --> 19:32.240
Actually they were supporting Taito's new Type-X2 arcade board, so it's actually not

19:32.240 --> 19:34.200
even SNK's board.

19:34.200 --> 19:35.580
Way to go.

19:35.580 --> 19:42.560
So they're going to be putting out some brand new games, including King of Fire's Maximum

19:42.560 --> 19:47.880
Impact Regulation A and Samurai Spirit Sen.

19:47.880 --> 19:54.880
Regulation A is actually based on the 3D home console fighting series by the same name,

19:54.880 --> 19:59.000
and at least includes one new character, Ash Crimson.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.120
Wow, Ash Crimson is such a generic sounding name.

20:03.120 --> 20:09.760
Anyways, he's from King of Fire's O3 and King of Fire's Eleven.

20:09.760 --> 20:12.680
Samurai Spirit Sen also play as a 3D game.

20:12.680 --> 20:17.200
This will be the second time the sword fighting series has made its way in the arcade in 3D

20:17.200 --> 20:19.240
since it landed on the Hyper-Neo Geo 64.

20:19.240 --> 20:26.240
And I have a little one that remembers King of Fighter's 64.

20:26.240 --> 20:31.840
The only good thing about that game was bringing in, what's your name, that had the two swords?

20:31.840 --> 20:32.840
Psycho Girl.

20:32.840 --> 20:36.760
I guess he has a big fat math for me, I've never been huge on SNK.

20:36.760 --> 20:41.960
They announced that they're going to be releasing King of Fighter's 12 on the new hardware 2.

20:41.960 --> 20:44.680
Goddamn, make a new game, SNK!

20:44.680 --> 20:46.320
Make a new fucking game!

20:46.320 --> 20:49.800
Give us Godot, Mark of the Wolves 2, give us Last Blade 3.

20:49.800 --> 20:50.800
Give us a new game!

20:50.800 --> 20:51.800
Give us a new series game!

20:51.800 --> 20:52.800
Give us Last Blade 3, please!

20:52.800 --> 20:53.800
Oh god, I'm done.

20:53.800 --> 20:55.800
Oh my god, I love Last Blade 3.

20:55.800 --> 21:01.600
Rob, aren't you looking forward to the Metal Slug anthology that's going to be on the

21:01.600 --> 21:02.600
Wii?

21:02.600 --> 21:06.600
I can't wait to play Metal Slug 413, which is like the same graphics for Metal Slug 1.

21:06.600 --> 21:09.080
I could play Metal Slug all day, because it's all about fighting.

21:09.080 --> 21:14.140
Okay, and King of Fighter's 2011, you know, granted Metal Slug is pretty awesome, but

21:14.140 --> 21:19.320
you know what, it's pretty awesome like 10 years ago, okay, now, whereas, they really

21:19.320 --> 21:23.680
need to make some different games, you know.

21:23.680 --> 21:28.800
Don't get me wrong, I mean, SNK is cool and all, you know, Bust a Move or Puzzle Bobble,

21:28.800 --> 21:34.640
whatever the hell you want to call it, but seriously, SNK, new fighting games, new Metal

21:34.640 --> 21:35.640
Slug something.

21:35.640 --> 21:37.640
Wait, wait, wait, that wasn't SNK.

21:37.640 --> 21:38.640
What?

21:38.640 --> 21:41.240
Oh, I keep, that was on all the freaking machines, wasn't it?

21:41.240 --> 21:42.240
On all their machines.

21:42.240 --> 21:43.240
We're playing more SNK now.

21:43.240 --> 21:44.240
Sure.

21:44.240 --> 21:48.440
But, why are they porting a shitty game like Maximum Impact?

21:48.440 --> 21:51.960
We didn't like it here in America, they didn't like it there in Japan.

21:51.960 --> 21:54.120
The voiceovers suck.

21:54.120 --> 21:57.480
Port a decent game to arcades.

21:57.480 --> 22:05.480
Well, as far as hopefully, and I would hope with 573 titles, something good will have

22:05.480 --> 22:06.480
to be among them.

22:06.480 --> 22:08.480
I'm sorry, was that 573 titles?

22:08.480 --> 22:09.480
573?

22:09.480 --> 22:10.480
Hmm, funny.

22:10.480 --> 22:11.480
Tokyo Game Show.

22:11.480 --> 22:19.040
It will be on display, it's actually listed up there on their website.

22:19.040 --> 22:22.320
And Jamie's going to read all 573 games on display right now.

22:22.320 --> 22:24.200
The hell I am.

22:24.200 --> 22:28.380
Last year's total was 516, so they were going to type it, I guess next year's going to be

22:28.380 --> 22:30.800
600 something?

22:30.800 --> 22:31.800
I have a prediction.

22:31.800 --> 22:34.560
How can you, that many freaking games?

22:34.560 --> 22:36.520
E3 probably has more.

22:36.520 --> 22:38.620
Konami will own Tokyo Game Show.

22:38.620 --> 22:43.000
And I'm wondering, when are we going to get WTF?

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
Didn't they change the name of that?

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
They did.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.320
They changed it and they changed it back.

22:46.320 --> 22:47.320
Good for them.

22:47.320 --> 22:48.320
WTF is coming out in October.

22:48.320 --> 22:49.320
Good.

22:49.320 --> 22:50.320
Book time fun.

22:50.320 --> 22:51.320
Good for them.

22:51.320 --> 22:55.600
But, there are actually, you know, a lot of games for PC, mobile phone games.

22:55.600 --> 22:59.960
They're actually saying for PC and mobile phone, they had 252 titles.

22:59.960 --> 23:09.000
For portables, DS will be bringing 52, PSP will have 33, 18 PS3 games are going to show

23:09.000 --> 23:12.720
and they'll probably all still suck and play on Rock Mountain servers.

23:12.720 --> 23:17.760
And 20 games coming out for Xbox 360, but they're only showing 5 for the Wii.

23:17.760 --> 23:21.120
Wii is holding out.

23:21.120 --> 23:31.560
The ones that they are actually going to be putting on is The Bleach Game, Shiraha Kirameku

23:31.560 --> 23:39.320
Marvelous Interactives, Bokujo Monogatari Wii, which is still a working title, and Elibits.

23:39.320 --> 23:42.880
They don't say if it's going to be playable or not.

23:42.880 --> 23:46.000
And actually, they do list a lot of the games.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.880
Well, they can go look on the web if they want to see that whole list.

23:48.880 --> 23:55.200
Yeah, though there is a Gundam game coming out on Xbox 360, which sounds kind of cool.

23:55.200 --> 23:58.160
It just says Gundam Operation Troy.

23:58.160 --> 24:01.280
I'm not sure if this is one of the games they're going to show at Tokyo Game Show.

24:01.280 --> 24:05.160
Bully, I don't know if that's going to be a big game in Japan, who knows.

24:05.160 --> 24:10.680
But Bully got an official rating this week from the ESRB and this kind of surprised me.

24:10.680 --> 24:14.640
Despite all the controversy that's going around, it's being rated T for Teen.

24:14.640 --> 24:16.920
Not M for Mature, but T for Teen.

24:16.920 --> 24:22.320
And the reason why it's been rated this way is crude humor, violence, sexual themes, language,

24:22.320 --> 24:26.760
and use of alcohol and tobacco earned this game a T rating.

24:26.760 --> 24:30.040
Now what's kind of interesting about this is that it seems like the expectations for

24:30.040 --> 24:35.880
the game here might be kind of low, because it is a current gen game, and PS2 is kind

24:35.880 --> 24:37.080
of winding down a little bit.

24:37.080 --> 24:40.480
So it seems like, despite all this controversy and everything, people are kind of setting

24:40.480 --> 24:41.480
themselves up for disappointment.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.480
I don't know.

24:42.480 --> 24:43.480
What do you think?

24:43.480 --> 24:44.480
Look, you've been following Bully a little more than I have.

24:44.480 --> 24:47.600
Do you think this game is going to sell awesome, or do you think most people have moved on

24:47.600 --> 24:49.240
to Saints Row on the 360?

24:49.240 --> 24:52.480
I would have liked to see it mature rated, but of course I understand why they're doing

24:52.480 --> 24:55.560
it so they can sell more.

24:55.560 --> 24:59.640
It's been delayed forever, and to be honest, some of the other Rockstar games not Grand

24:59.640 --> 25:00.880
Theft Auto have been pretty good.

25:00.880 --> 25:04.880
I mean, Warriors was pretty fun for a while, and then I got bored with it.

25:04.880 --> 25:09.440
But Bully looks pretty fun, and they've got a really good system for all the classes and

25:09.440 --> 25:10.880
stuff that you have to take.

25:10.880 --> 25:14.000
A lot of minigames and stuff involved in that, so I think it'll be pretty good if you give

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
it a chance.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
I don't know.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.680
I just have to wait until it comes out, I guess.

25:18.680 --> 25:22.080
Act Death in our chat room says, Jack Thompson will sue.

25:22.080 --> 25:23.080
Jack Thompson's stupid.

25:23.080 --> 25:25.880
It doesn't have anything to do with, you know, great.

25:25.880 --> 25:28.520
So he's going to complain about this game.

25:28.520 --> 25:29.520
Play the damn game.

25:29.520 --> 25:30.520
You'll see that there's nothing.

25:30.520 --> 25:34.680
I don't even think it has much to do with bullying people, to be honest, if you actually

25:34.680 --> 25:35.680
play the game.

25:35.680 --> 25:38.160
O.L. Army Eddie says, sexual themes?

25:38.160 --> 25:39.200
Usually that's an automatic M.

25:39.200 --> 25:40.200
Well, interesting.

25:40.200 --> 25:41.200
Not necessarily.

25:41.200 --> 25:46.360
It could just be a chick dancing in her bra or something.

25:46.360 --> 25:49.880
That might not be M, but it might be a little bit, you know.

25:49.880 --> 25:53.440
Not to bring this up again, but they have sexual themes in The Sims 2.

25:53.440 --> 25:56.640
And that's rated T. Yeah, it has woohoo.

25:56.640 --> 25:59.120
Especially if you get the special furniture with the sex animations.

25:59.120 --> 26:02.200
Yeah, woohoo in, I think, on the couch.

26:02.200 --> 26:06.960
Woohoo in the bed, woohoo in the hot tub, and then something else.

26:06.960 --> 26:07.960
Woohoo indeed.

26:07.960 --> 26:10.440
They should have been, Nintendo should have come out.

26:10.440 --> 26:16.080
The old Sims, the first Sims game actually had someone programmed a countertop that you

26:16.080 --> 26:19.720
could woohoo on with full animations.

26:19.720 --> 26:20.720
Wow.

26:20.720 --> 26:21.720
Okay.

26:21.720 --> 26:22.720
Woohoo indeed.

26:22.720 --> 26:24.720
But hey, online content may change.

26:24.720 --> 26:25.720
Anyways.

26:25.720 --> 26:31.840
So, speaking about, you know, some stuff that people think that games like Bully Cause.

26:31.840 --> 26:38.320
Well, there was a shooter in Montreal that went and killed a bunch of people at his school,

26:38.320 --> 26:41.440
and guess what they found as one of his favorite games.

26:41.440 --> 26:47.020
Apparently this guy plays a lot of games, including one that happens to be Super Column

26:47.020 --> 26:48.920
by Massacre RPG.

26:48.920 --> 26:54.320
You know, not the sequel to Super Mario RPG, just to clear that up for you.

26:54.320 --> 26:55.320
But uh.

26:55.320 --> 26:56.480
Thanks, I wasn't sure.

26:56.480 --> 27:01.140
But anyways, yeah, so apparently they're saying, oh, see, he played that game, therefore he

27:01.140 --> 27:04.700
must have learned, you know, the kill from that game.

27:04.700 --> 27:09.400
But apparently he also played other games, you know, that weren't violent.

27:09.400 --> 27:10.400
Who cares?

27:10.400 --> 27:11.400
I mean.

27:11.400 --> 27:15.480
No, I'm thinking he was a couple bricks shy of a load, if you know what I mean, and shouldn't

27:15.480 --> 27:17.140
have been playing any video games at all.

27:17.140 --> 27:19.120
He should have been in school reading.

27:19.120 --> 27:20.640
Did you see the videos of him on CNN?

27:20.640 --> 27:22.760
No, I don't watch the news.

27:22.760 --> 27:28.320
I watch, I do, they have CNN on them, I work, and I do regularly read CNN.com and BBC World

27:28.320 --> 27:29.320
News.

27:29.320 --> 27:36.040
But yes, I keep up with current events, and the guy was psycho anyway, he was talking

27:36.040 --> 27:40.200
about how he just wanted to kill everybody, showing off his gun collection, his knife

27:40.200 --> 27:41.200
collection.

27:41.200 --> 27:47.440
This guy, I don't think a real gamer would have been that crazy, he was nuts.

27:47.440 --> 27:53.160
But it's all the game's fault, it's all about the game, what did the games do to him?

27:53.160 --> 27:55.800
I blame his psychosis and his parents for not being more observant.

27:55.800 --> 27:59.180
I don't think it was his favorite game, but you know what, when you see that, of course,

27:59.180 --> 28:04.120
if you're going to be trying to spin this in the news, that's going to get the most

28:04.120 --> 28:05.120
attention.

28:05.120 --> 28:06.880
So let's of course blame it on the games.

28:06.880 --> 28:09.560
Naturally, lots of feedback.

28:09.560 --> 28:13.680
Chat room over at orangeontrader.com, click on chat, olarmieddy says, Super Columbine

28:13.680 --> 28:16.840
RPG does not glorify school shootings at all.

28:16.840 --> 28:21.600
Let's see, I always butcher this name, Jamie, help me, Nazgul Slayer?

28:21.600 --> 28:22.600
Nazgul?

28:22.600 --> 28:23.600
Nazgul.

28:23.600 --> 28:26.160
Damn it, that one fucks me up.

28:26.160 --> 28:31.400
Nazgul Slayer says, he used RPG Maker 2000 to make Super Columbine Massacre, I read an

28:31.400 --> 28:32.440
article about it.

28:32.440 --> 28:37.720
So it's not really Super Columbine Massacre that's a problem, it's RPG Maker, the devil's

28:37.720 --> 28:38.720
game.

28:38.720 --> 28:39.720
No, no, no.

28:39.720 --> 28:41.720
I'm attacking the darkness.

28:41.720 --> 28:44.600
I'm using magic missile.

28:44.600 --> 28:50.440
Sakurina would like to point out, also his gun was legal but his clips weren't.

28:50.440 --> 28:52.680
Hmm, interesting.

28:52.680 --> 29:02.760
You know what, this is, it just further illustrates that society is more ready to look for a scapegoat

29:02.760 --> 29:05.720
than actually treat the true root of the problem.

29:05.720 --> 29:07.780
Do these kind of stories make you angry, DarkSakura?

29:07.780 --> 29:11.120
They make me furious, livid, ludicrously livid.

29:11.120 --> 29:12.860
Do they make you want to rant a little bit?

29:12.860 --> 29:15.120
They make me want to go to a school and shoot people.

29:15.120 --> 29:34.920
Well it wouldn't be episode 200 of a podcast without the FUs of the Week.

29:34.920 --> 29:42.160
My FU of the Week, I can't believe I completely blamed, I had what my FU was going to be and

29:42.160 --> 29:45.840
it wasn't related to traffic at all.

29:45.840 --> 29:49.800
My FU of the Week goes toward the Japantown Anime Festival.

29:49.800 --> 29:53.960
Oh my god, crappiest convention ever.

29:53.960 --> 29:58.560
Well, in their defense they were pretty small.

29:58.560 --> 30:00.840
I mean, but still.

30:00.840 --> 30:05.200
Hey, that's not nice talking about the Japanese being small.

30:05.200 --> 30:08.240
Okay, this is my Pokemon.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.240
You connect all your Pokemon.

30:10.240 --> 30:17.600
I understand, my problem with it being, no this is in San Francisco by the way, my problem

30:17.600 --> 30:23.720
with it was that it suffered the same problem that AX started to suffer, as in being spread

30:23.720 --> 30:29.640
across different areas, you had to go from one mall to the other, into the hotel, into

30:29.640 --> 30:37.000
the courtyard downstairs under Kinokuniya at Kintetsu Mall, but they had a pretty good

30:37.000 --> 30:39.600
band that we were there for listening to the warm up, they actually sounded pretty cool

30:39.600 --> 30:45.880
but the dealer's room, it was a dealer's closet, the closet, and they had some interesting

30:45.880 --> 30:51.200
stuff, some nice stuff, but you know, overall it was pretty much what you could find online

30:51.200 --> 30:52.200
pretty easily.

30:52.200 --> 30:55.800
But the cost, the way I was most disappointed with was the cosplay.

30:55.800 --> 31:01.080
I expected to go and see people taking advantage of the opportunity to cosplay, there was a

31:01.080 --> 31:06.920
pretty big Naruto group, there was a pretty big bleach group, but it's been done.

31:06.920 --> 31:13.880
Yeah, I could go see that at any other convention, we did meet lots of nice people, we met some

31:13.880 --> 31:19.920
people on DA, on DeviantArt who were really cool, but overall I think I had a higher expectation

31:19.920 --> 31:23.920
for it just because of how it was being played up, they were having all this different stuff

31:23.920 --> 31:30.280
go on, and it really was just, just, blah.

31:30.280 --> 31:34.640
The only advantage of it is that our badges gave us discounts at the stores, so I could

31:34.640 --> 31:38.720
buy porn.

31:38.720 --> 31:46.040
Um, Loki, you have views of the week, mine don't have to do with porn.

31:46.040 --> 31:51.600
F you to Wicker Man, that movie, why did they have to kill Nicolas Cage's character off,

31:51.600 --> 31:56.040
I mean, it was getting good, like the whole movie is kind of like eh, okay this whole

31:56.040 --> 31:57.040
island with...

31:57.040 --> 32:00.200
Wow, thanks for saving me ten bucks!

32:00.200 --> 32:02.360
And isn't that how the original ended?

32:02.360 --> 32:04.000
Yes, but I'll get to that.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.680
So here's the thing, why did they have to kill his character off, it started getting

32:07.680 --> 32:12.120
good, I mean he punched a woman in the face, and I was like, god damn this movie's gonna

32:12.120 --> 32:18.120
be awesome, then, fucking um, oh god I can't remember her name, the chick from Save the

32:18.120 --> 32:22.720
Last Dance or whatever, I think she was in that, and she like lunges at me, like does

32:22.720 --> 32:25.880
a sidekick and kicks her into the wall, I'm like, oh my god this movie just got a hundred

32:25.880 --> 32:30.320
times better, and then they had to go set him on fire, so you know, that fucking sucks.

32:30.320 --> 32:34.280
I don't care if that's how the original sucked, the end, actually the whole movie should have

32:34.280 --> 32:40.400
had just like Chuck Norris killing people, and that would have been a lot better.

32:40.400 --> 32:45.680
The Wicker Man is supposed to be burnt, for any of our fellow pagans listening to the

32:45.680 --> 32:46.680
show.

32:46.680 --> 32:47.680
The Burning Man?

32:47.680 --> 32:51.520
Yeah, the whole movie reminded me of Burning Man, like in Seattle or something, you know,

32:51.520 --> 32:58.320
it's like, alright, um, my FU of the week goes to my iPod, which upon boot up today

32:58.320 --> 33:00.720
gave me a frowny face of death.

33:00.720 --> 33:06.000
I blame iTunes 7, because ever since I installed iTunes 7, that thing started acting weird,

33:06.000 --> 33:10.480
like iTunes did not want to talk to my old ass, you know, fourth gen iPod or whatever

33:10.480 --> 33:16.040
it is, the black and white before they were color, iPod, so, FU iTunes 7 for ruining my

33:16.040 --> 33:21.960
iPod, and now I can't listen to podcasts in my car, so, no Bobby, no All Games, no other

33:21.960 --> 33:28.120
podcasts I listen to, or OLR in my car for a while, until I can afford the video iPod.

33:28.120 --> 33:35.440
So FU frowny face of death, I blame Apple, Loki, just bite your tongue, Chris, I blame

33:35.440 --> 33:38.760
the lack of rockbox, how about your, okay, Drew Nami, your FUs of the week.

33:38.760 --> 33:44.280
Alright, first off, FU to missing class, for an entire week, including the week where both

33:44.280 --> 33:49.760
the practice test and the test were going on, due to people having appointments and

33:49.760 --> 33:55.680
me either forgetting or them not telling me, I can't remember which, aside from that, just

33:55.680 --> 34:02.720
FU to having a very blah week, with nothing else going on, so, no FUs at all for, you

34:02.720 --> 34:05.720
know, past that, Chris?

34:05.720 --> 34:09.600
I just wanted to really quickly say, sorry to the chatroom, restore didn't work and reset

34:09.600 --> 34:13.720
didn't work, thanks for the thought, but, tried it, sorry.

34:13.720 --> 34:21.480
Okay, for lack of anything better, my FU of the week is to my bed at home, it for some

34:21.480 --> 34:27.280
reason thinks that I need to be molested in the middle of the night, what kind of bed

34:27.280 --> 34:34.280
is this, I want to buy one, IKEA actually, alright, okay, there is only one bed, god

34:34.280 --> 34:41.740
I love Sweden, okay, I'd never let any of my friends, ABBA and molesting beds, it doesn't

34:41.740 --> 34:47.800
get much better than that, do you want to hear my story or not, okay, okay, we, okay,

34:47.800 --> 34:51.000
there's only one other bed that's available at my house when my friends come over and

34:51.000 --> 34:56.040
that's the one my dad and his girlfriend use, so they have to sleep in my bed and twice

34:56.040 --> 35:01.880
I woke it up to my friends trying to molest me, Jamie slept in there last night and she

35:01.880 --> 35:13.400
was all trying to pet my chest, okay, I was having a dream, this show just got a lot hotter,

35:13.400 --> 35:18.240
I was having a dream about a couple of characters and they were like just sleeping in the bed

35:18.240 --> 35:23.120
and there was a cat there and this is what Shermie does, she'll crawl in the bed between

35:23.120 --> 35:28.520
me and Dan and I'll reach over and pet her, so in the dream, I guess the character there

35:28.520 --> 35:33.320
in my dream was reaching over to pet the cat and I opened my eyes to see my hand hovering

35:33.320 --> 35:39.240
over Kristen's chest and I was like oh you're not a cat, that was Marissa's reaction except

35:39.240 --> 35:46.400
she said oh you don't have a penis, she thought my friend Marissa came down a few weekends

35:46.400 --> 35:51.400
ago and she thought I was her boyfriend Christopher and was all rubbing my back and she's like

35:51.400 --> 35:56.040
oh wait you don't have a penis and turned over and fell asleep, so people want to molest

35:56.040 --> 35:58.800
me in my bed.

35:58.800 --> 36:03.480
And to respond to Jeremy Todd, I have had a hot lesbian dream about Angelina Jolie,

36:03.480 --> 36:04.480
thank you.

36:04.480 --> 36:09.880
I think I've had a hot lesbian dream about Angelina Jolie, actually, who hasn't had a

36:09.880 --> 36:10.880
hot lesbian dream about her?

36:10.880 --> 36:13.720
I'm not kidding either and I also had one about Billy Paper.

36:13.720 --> 36:28.400
Alright anyway, we had a story earlier in the program about Final Fantasy XII and Final

36:28.400 --> 36:32.720
Fantasy XII Day, well maybe there will be two Final Fantasy XII Days because guess what?

36:32.720 --> 36:37.980
There is a Final Fantasy XII related title coming to the DS, not a lot of information

36:37.980 --> 36:42.360
on it at this time, it is called Final Fantasy Revenant Wings and it's going to be a sequel

36:42.360 --> 36:51.120
to Final Fantasy XII and will be available on Nintendo DS, hmm interesting.

36:51.120 --> 36:55.640
We do know it's got a pirate themed storyline and could possibly be a prequel, not a sequel

36:55.640 --> 36:57.320
to Final Fantasy XII.

36:57.320 --> 37:03.360
That's interesting that it's on the PSP, oh maybe because PSP sucks in Japan.

37:03.360 --> 37:05.680
Don't know, don't know.

37:05.680 --> 37:11.500
Alright well Dark Sakura, for 200 weeks now she's surfed the internet up and down, actually

37:11.500 --> 37:15.040
just kidding because we didn't have this segment until about 170, but she surfs the internet

37:15.040 --> 37:19.320
up and down each and every week to find a website that you want to be visiting and she

37:19.320 --> 37:22.640
shares it with you folks in a segment we call the website of the week.

37:22.640 --> 37:28.600
Dark Sakura, where should the kids be pointing their browsers to this week?

37:28.600 --> 37:34.160
The website of the week, this one is a very special one, especially for episode 200.

37:34.160 --> 37:40.380
The website of the week is orangeloungeradio.com, you must go to our site everyday, hang out

37:40.380 --> 37:44.880
on our forums, we are awesome, if you find news stories, link them up there, if we don't

37:44.880 --> 37:50.600
think it's utter crap then we'll put it up on the board and you get to talk to us, because

37:50.600 --> 37:51.600
it's special.

37:51.600 --> 37:59.000
And you know I figured it's about damn time that I plug our own damn site, so orangeloungeradio.com

37:59.000 --> 38:04.160
is the site of the week, shameless self-promotion, damn right.

38:04.160 --> 38:14.280
And you can go to E3 on PSP, it's about as updated as the OLR on PSP.

38:14.280 --> 38:21.080
If you want to see something that hasn't been updated in like 5 years, there's darksakura.com.

38:21.080 --> 38:26.840
Seriously I haven't updated it in 5 years.

38:26.840 --> 38:27.840
Good job!

38:27.840 --> 38:30.600
And we have our blogs at stuff.orangeloungeradio.com.

38:30.600 --> 38:33.160
Those blogs haven't been updated in like a year.

38:33.160 --> 38:34.600
Well alright, we better.

38:34.600 --> 38:35.600
Get on that.

38:35.600 --> 38:38.440
And there's my Jack Thompson is a Bully rant on there too.

38:38.440 --> 38:41.080
There's some good reads on there if you haven't seen it yet.

38:41.080 --> 38:48.200
Anyways, what's kind of interesting and very disappointing to me is that it was announced

38:48.200 --> 38:55.640
this week that the PS3 controller will not be named Poos, it will be named Sixaxis or

38:55.640 --> 39:03.360
Siaxis or whatever, it basically comes from the fact that the controller has six different

39:03.360 --> 39:09.400
axes of motion sensing, and yeah, since it doesn't rumble I guess they can't really call

39:09.400 --> 39:11.080
it DualShock now can they?

39:11.080 --> 39:16.640
So Sixaxis is the name of the controller, hooray.

39:16.640 --> 39:19.580
It's also Palindrome.

39:19.580 --> 39:20.920
How do we find this out for sure?

39:20.920 --> 39:22.840
How do we know for sure that this is the name of it?

39:22.840 --> 39:32.480
Well actually this was from a patent, or I should say a trademark that was registered,

39:32.480 --> 39:36.460
and it's been pulled up and it's owned by Sony, so hurrah.

39:36.460 --> 39:39.040
What if they're just trying a couple things out?

39:39.040 --> 39:45.720
It's true, I don't know if it's for sure, but you know what, it's also been mentioned

39:45.720 --> 39:53.320
Sixaxis in a few different PR things, not as, you know, it might be like the system,

39:53.320 --> 39:57.760
named for the system of the motion sensing, like for example, it says, this one quote

39:57.760 --> 40:02.120
here, the controller for the PS3 employs breakthrough technology of high precision, highly sensitive

40:02.120 --> 40:08.840
Sixaxis sensing system that does not require any devices other than the controller itself

40:08.840 --> 40:11.640
for seamless interactive operation.

40:11.640 --> 40:18.080
So that might be just, you know, the technology they're calling it Sixaxis, I don't know.

40:18.080 --> 40:19.080
Interesting.

40:19.080 --> 40:23.600
All right, well every week you guys write us letters and we read them right here on

40:23.600 --> 40:25.960
Orange Lounge Radio's podcast.

40:25.960 --> 40:29.580
If you want to send us an email, it's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and when you send

40:29.580 --> 40:39.920
your email, Dark Sakura suits up in her biohazard suit and puts on her rubber gloves, and digs

40:39.920 --> 40:43.320
on into the mailbag and pulls out some of her favorite emails that she's going to share

40:43.320 --> 40:48.120
with us right now, and these are special emails because this is the 200th episode worth of

40:48.120 --> 40:49.120
emails.

40:49.120 --> 40:57.600
So if you're in tonight's mailbag, you're very special, boys and girls.

40:57.600 --> 41:02.240
Some skanky, skanky hoe bag named DisneyPunk10 sent us an email.

41:02.240 --> 41:07.600
This says, all you guys suck, Rob is not sexy, Loki is stupid, Jamie is a mean bitch.

41:07.600 --> 41:11.680
Your show is full of lesbians and 30-year-old children who live in their parents' cellar.

41:11.680 --> 41:12.680
Die!

41:12.680 --> 41:13.680
Is that good enough hate mail?

41:13.680 --> 41:16.360
No, you know I love you guys, happy 200.

41:16.360 --> 41:18.520
Chris, isn't your online name DisneyPunk10?

41:18.520 --> 41:19.520
DisneyButt?

41:19.520 --> 41:20.520
DisneyButt?

41:20.520 --> 41:23.720
That's why I'm going to start calling you after that email.

41:23.720 --> 41:24.720
Why, yes!

41:24.720 --> 41:29.120
As a matter of fact, DisneyPunk10 is my handle.

41:29.120 --> 41:31.480
That's an awful coincidence.

41:31.480 --> 41:32.640
Well thanks for the hate mail.

41:32.640 --> 41:34.600
We love getting hate mail at orangeloungeradio.com.

41:34.600 --> 41:35.600
Bitch.

41:35.600 --> 41:38.160
We'll get Maisie to check it out of her later.

41:38.160 --> 41:40.280
Nah, she brings me cake, I love her.

41:40.280 --> 41:41.280
And donuts.

41:41.280 --> 41:42.280
And crowns.

41:42.280 --> 41:43.280
And crowns.

41:43.280 --> 41:44.280
Yep.

41:44.280 --> 41:49.600
I'm going to go parade in the living room right now while Jamie reads the next email

41:49.600 --> 41:52.720
and listen for the laughter.

41:52.720 --> 41:57.320
You look like such a lovely princess, Rob.

41:57.320 --> 42:04.040
And anyway, our next email comes from Robert M. Now that Apple has announced that you can

42:04.040 --> 42:09.200
purchase games for the iPod, what do you see becoming of this form of mobile gaming?

42:09.200 --> 42:14.040
I may pick up Bejeweled just to see, but later it'll be interesting to see how the unit's

42:14.040 --> 42:17.600
limited control are basically like an Atari 2600 paddle controller.

42:17.600 --> 42:21.320
I really wonder even seeing the preview of how Pac-Man is controlled is used.

42:21.320 --> 42:26.600
I can imagine a great version of Jairus for instance.

42:26.600 --> 42:29.560
Also how does this open up the possibility of homebrewed games?

42:29.560 --> 42:32.760
It's easy to make your own music and movies and play them on the iPod without ever starting

42:32.760 --> 42:36.840
an account to buy them, but what about those with skill and patience to program full games?

42:36.840 --> 42:38.880
I thought they already had homebrew games.

42:38.880 --> 42:44.240
Like they had Doom on there for what reason, I don't know.

42:44.240 --> 42:47.320
They said hail to the queen when I walked out there.

42:47.320 --> 42:48.600
Bitches.

42:48.600 --> 42:53.120
I think since they've already got it, we'll see more homebrew games.

42:53.120 --> 42:54.160
I missed the reading of the email.

42:54.160 --> 42:55.160
Was this about the iPod games?

42:55.160 --> 42:56.160
Yeah.

42:56.160 --> 42:58.160
Okay, because I dug in there earlier in the week.

42:58.160 --> 43:02.240
I thought I saw some gay in there.

43:02.240 --> 43:03.240
I don't know.

43:03.240 --> 43:07.440
The problem with gaming on the iPod is that frickin' wheel.

43:07.440 --> 43:08.840
That's not the best controller in the world.

43:08.840 --> 43:12.520
You know what would be great though is that little thing that you plug your USB thing

43:12.520 --> 43:13.520
into in the bottom?

43:13.520 --> 43:18.600
Wouldn't that be an awesome place to just jam a controller into and then there you go.

43:18.600 --> 43:19.600
That's what Apple should do.

43:19.600 --> 43:20.600
Apple will make more money.

43:20.600 --> 43:22.240
I think that would be a smart idea.

43:22.240 --> 43:25.840
If Apple wanted to get into gaming on the iPod, that would be a great addition, but

43:25.840 --> 43:26.840
what do I know?

43:26.840 --> 43:28.600
I'm just some schmo on the internet.

43:28.600 --> 43:34.480
Our next email says, Dear OLR crew, I would like to say thank you for the past 1.5 years

43:34.480 --> 43:35.480
of entertainment.

43:35.480 --> 43:39.540
I went into the gigantic list of gaming podcasts and my first random pick happened to be this

43:39.540 --> 43:40.540
wonderful podcast.

43:40.540 --> 43:42.640
I've been listening ever since and it's been fun.

43:42.640 --> 43:45.000
The host and guest hosts are great.

43:45.000 --> 43:50.240
Also this podcast introduced to some of the coolest bands, Gorillaz, Freeze Pop, Games

43:50.240 --> 43:55.080
Guitar Hero, Katamari, Websites, Gorillaz and Official DeviantArt, and Survival Tips.

43:55.080 --> 43:57.200
I now know how to stop a camel.

43:57.200 --> 44:00.440
Thanks for being a part of all your listener's life.

44:00.440 --> 44:01.440
Reject false icons.

44:01.440 --> 44:02.440
Ion671.

44:02.440 --> 44:03.440
PS.

44:03.440 --> 44:04.440
Come to the East Coast sometime.

44:04.440 --> 44:08.920
That was sweet and I'm coming to New York City end of October and I'm going to be going

44:08.920 --> 44:10.800
to the Nintendo World Store to meet fans.

44:10.800 --> 44:11.800
So I don't know what day that is.

44:11.800 --> 44:13.800
I would like to go, but I'm going to YowieCon.

44:13.800 --> 44:14.800
Hot.

44:14.800 --> 44:17.200
That was a sweet email.

44:17.200 --> 44:18.200
Thank you.

44:18.200 --> 44:19.200
Heart.

44:19.200 --> 44:24.840
For anyone who wants to know where I got my survival tips from, it's the Worst Case Scenario

44:24.840 --> 44:25.840
Survival Handbook.

44:25.840 --> 44:26.840
Whoa.

44:26.840 --> 44:27.840
Sorry.

44:27.840 --> 44:28.840
Sorry.

44:28.840 --> 44:29.840
We had a snafu there.

44:29.840 --> 44:31.600
A Neverending Story started playing in the background there.

44:31.600 --> 44:32.600
Sorry guys.

44:32.600 --> 44:34.320
The Neverending Soda.

44:34.320 --> 44:38.320
My bad.

44:38.320 --> 44:40.840
Next up is Warrior Bob.

44:40.840 --> 44:42.440
That's such a cool name.

44:42.440 --> 44:43.440
Hello again.

44:43.440 --> 44:45.680
It was neat to hear my last letter read on air.

44:45.680 --> 44:46.680
Thanks for that.

44:46.680 --> 44:50.880
You are correct that you guys were invited to Cal Poly SLO sometime last year, although

44:50.880 --> 44:55.080
it wasn't me, but rather our DDR Club President, a guy named Joe Etter, who actually invited

44:55.080 --> 44:58.840
you to come down to a Bamani-related event that the club ran.

44:58.840 --> 45:00.240
That's what it is.

45:00.240 --> 45:04.240
Of course, if you ever do make it to my school, I bet we could arrange to have all our part

45:04.240 --> 45:06.740
of the show broadcast over our local station.

45:06.740 --> 45:13.240
You probably have to tone down the lesbian pillow fights, but it may be a good way to

45:13.240 --> 45:17.280
get some exposure to the non-podcast audience.

45:17.280 --> 45:20.840
Reading that again to myself, I suppose lesbian pillow fights may have a similar effect.

45:20.840 --> 45:23.000
You know, I didn't mean to bring that in.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
That was an accident.

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
No, it's fine.

45:25.000 --> 45:26.000
It's fine.

45:26.000 --> 45:31.280
Regardless, were it feasible, I'd definitely attend a traveling OLR show.

45:31.280 --> 45:34.680
I had to miss the Fonami panel last spring, so I'd love to have that sort of thing happen

45:34.680 --> 45:35.680
again.

45:35.680 --> 45:36.680
We will, by the way, be at Fonami next year.

45:36.680 --> 45:41.200
Fonami next year, and it looks like Sakura Con is also for Seattle people.

45:41.200 --> 45:46.040
We're going to be there, and possibly, at least myself, we'll be at one East Coast Con,

45:46.040 --> 45:48.520
so we're going to be doing Anime Cons up the butt next year.

45:48.520 --> 45:52.960
I want to try and get to Otacon next year, but I can't get to Otacon for that yet, but

45:52.960 --> 45:53.960
more on this.

45:53.960 --> 45:54.960
Huh?

45:54.960 --> 46:00.560
I'm going to Asa next year, and Megzi, so we can try something.

46:00.560 --> 46:01.560
Flyer girls!

46:01.560 --> 46:05.440
We can walk around with a shirt or something stupid like that.

46:05.440 --> 46:07.200
Afterwards we'll drink Guinness and play old games.

46:07.200 --> 46:08.200
It'll be a party.

46:08.200 --> 46:09.200
I love Guinness.

46:09.200 --> 46:10.200
That is hot.

46:10.200 --> 46:11.200
That is my idea of a party.

46:11.200 --> 46:13.500
Looking forward to your show hitting the podcast stream, so I'll hear you then.

46:13.500 --> 46:14.500
Have a great night.

46:14.500 --> 46:16.480
Unrelatedly, fuck Pyrite.

46:16.480 --> 46:17.480
Amen!

46:17.480 --> 46:19.120
Pyrite is a cult.

46:19.120 --> 46:21.520
That is a card-carrying OLR member.

46:21.520 --> 46:25.120
For a second there, I thought you said Pyrite, and I'm like, damn that fool's goal, damn

46:25.120 --> 46:26.120
it!

46:26.120 --> 46:27.520
Pyrite is also a false icon.

46:27.520 --> 46:32.640
Pyrite is cool because it crystalizes in cube form.

46:32.640 --> 46:34.640
I took chemistry, hello!

46:34.640 --> 46:36.360
For science!

46:36.360 --> 46:37.360
Science and technology!

46:37.360 --> 46:38.360
Anyway.

46:38.360 --> 46:39.360
Science!

46:39.360 --> 46:42.360
We should ban Dihydrogen Monoxide.

46:42.360 --> 46:47.040
Yeah, you know that Dihydrogen Monoxide is just... water.

46:47.040 --> 46:48.040
I know.

46:48.040 --> 46:50.040
Wasn't that on an episode of...

46:50.040 --> 46:51.040
Penn & Teller's bullshit.

46:51.040 --> 46:54.040
One of my friends was just telling me about that episode.

46:54.040 --> 46:55.040
Anyway, next email.

46:55.040 --> 46:56.040
Okay.

46:56.040 --> 46:59.480
Hey, OLR, just wanted to congratulate you on your 200th episode since I won't be listening

46:59.480 --> 47:00.480
live tonight.

47:00.480 --> 47:01.480
Have a good one.

47:01.480 --> 47:02.480
And that's from Mike.

47:02.480 --> 47:05.160
Thank you.

47:05.160 --> 47:06.160
Next one up.

47:06.160 --> 47:07.240
Ooh, long one.

47:07.240 --> 47:13.600
Not long one, but this is actually from Kenji, who I posted his email as my email of the

47:13.600 --> 47:14.600
month.

47:14.600 --> 47:15.600
Oh, this is our essay writer.

47:15.600 --> 47:18.220
I'm going to start doing an email of the month, by the way, so make sure you start sending

47:18.220 --> 47:23.240
in very thoughtful and well-written things that don't have hate in them.

47:23.240 --> 47:25.520
Happy 200th episode, OLR.

47:25.520 --> 47:28.080
Congratulations on making it this far, and here's hoping for your continued successes

47:28.080 --> 47:29.080
and good fortune.

47:29.080 --> 47:30.080
Cheers.

47:30.080 --> 47:31.080
This won't be long.

47:31.080 --> 47:33.680
I figure that everything I mention in this letter will already be mentioned before you

47:33.680 --> 47:35.440
even touch this week's mailbag.

47:35.440 --> 47:37.320
They blew it, blew it, blew it, blew it.

47:37.320 --> 47:40.200
Nintendo couldn't have been set up any better.

47:40.200 --> 47:42.360
$600 PS3 on November 17th.

47:42.360 --> 47:44.280
Ken Kutaragi stick up his ass.

47:44.280 --> 47:48.760
Microsoft with a dollar sign problem with selling 360s in every other market in the

47:48.760 --> 47:49.760
U.S.

47:49.760 --> 47:50.760
The cards were all laid out in Nintendo's favor.

47:50.760 --> 47:55.400
All Reggie had to say was $199, October something or the other, and get off the stage.

47:55.400 --> 47:56.400
But they didn't.

47:56.400 --> 48:00.400
That isn't to say it's not a bad thing selling two days of GASP after the already impossible

48:00.400 --> 48:03.840
to reserve PS3 for $250 with a pack-in compilation game.

48:03.840 --> 48:07.140
It's just that they could have really went over the hearts and minds of gamers and non-gamers

48:07.140 --> 48:11.040
alike with a cheaper price point, or included a second controller set.

48:11.040 --> 48:13.480
But is Nintendo selling systems at a profit?

48:13.480 --> 48:14.480
What else is new?

48:14.480 --> 48:18.360
Also, does anyone else see the pick-to-chat-like qualities in the Wii channels?

48:18.360 --> 48:21.080
Hell, it might just be the system alone.

48:21.080 --> 48:25.160
Just as pick-to-chat sold DS systems in Japan without selling any accompanying software,

48:25.160 --> 48:28.680
photo channel and the Mii channel especially seem to be the quirky things that'll keep

48:28.680 --> 48:30.480
non-gamers entertained for hours.

48:30.480 --> 48:35.680
Then they have the Wii forums, where you can post stuff with your character chair as your

48:35.680 --> 48:36.680
little avatar.

48:36.680 --> 48:38.780
Yeah, but that's specific to your Wii, right?

48:38.780 --> 48:40.120
That's not internet Wii.

48:40.120 --> 48:41.120
I'm not sure.

48:41.120 --> 48:42.120
I think it was your own Wii.

48:42.120 --> 48:44.600
It was like for family members to leave messages to each other.

48:44.600 --> 48:45.600
Hi, Mom!

48:45.600 --> 48:46.600
You suck!

48:46.600 --> 48:47.600
Stop playing!

48:47.600 --> 48:48.600
Dad's a whore.

48:48.600 --> 48:53.160
For a good time, call Mom at...

48:53.160 --> 48:54.160
Last night!

48:54.160 --> 48:55.160
Ooh!

48:55.160 --> 49:02.080
And it said, uh, man, just my opinions from a slightly educated gamer, but if you haven't

49:02.080 --> 49:07.520
answered this already, will the higher next, near next-gen price point keep you guys from

49:07.520 --> 49:08.520
getting a Wii?

49:08.520 --> 49:09.840
Thanks and congrats again, Kenji.

49:09.840 --> 49:15.160
Well, didn't he say, I mean, I think this guy's great and all because he has a lot to

49:15.160 --> 49:19.160
say, but didn't he just say, you know, Nintendo fucked up and then he said, but it sounds

49:19.160 --> 49:20.560
kind of neat.

49:20.560 --> 49:25.720
I think what the intention was is that Nintendo could have gotten a whole lot more in terms

49:25.720 --> 49:29.840
of new people buying the system had it just been dropped a little bit more, had a few

49:29.840 --> 49:31.520
more pack-ins.

49:31.520 --> 49:32.520
It's not doom and gloom.

49:32.520 --> 49:34.800
It's still the cheapest.

49:34.800 --> 49:37.320
It's still the cheapest one on the shelf.

49:37.320 --> 49:40.240
It's not only the cheapest one on the shelf, but it's the cheapest one on the shelf with

49:40.240 --> 49:41.240
the game.

49:41.240 --> 49:44.440
And you can buy that in a 360 and still not pay as much as you would for...

49:44.440 --> 49:45.440
Wii 60!

49:45.440 --> 49:50.560
I'm pre-ordering one in both GameStop and my work, so I may have two.

49:50.560 --> 49:54.640
Because my GameStop, or my one where I work, will probably be getting it in on Wednesday

49:54.640 --> 49:56.360
before the launch.

49:56.360 --> 49:59.440
I'm not allowed to talk about how I'm getting a Wii, but I am getting a Wii, and I will

49:59.440 --> 50:01.640
have it on release day.

50:01.640 --> 50:04.080
Well, we'll have ours on release day.

50:04.080 --> 50:06.080
We all will because we're special.

50:06.080 --> 50:09.360
Anyway, the last email tonight comes from Alessa.

50:09.360 --> 50:10.360
Cool.

50:10.360 --> 50:12.080
Dude, like Silent Hill?

50:12.080 --> 50:13.080
I don't know.

50:13.080 --> 50:14.520
I don't know if I'm excited about that.

50:14.520 --> 50:15.520
No, I'm kidding.

50:15.520 --> 50:19.880
It's actually a link to an article about a father that killed his child over a video

50:19.880 --> 50:20.880
game.

50:20.880 --> 50:23.880
Is there a hole in the email?

50:23.880 --> 50:24.880
Oh no.

50:24.880 --> 50:25.880
What happened?

50:25.880 --> 50:26.880
And I looked at this.

50:26.880 --> 50:27.880
I'll link it in the chat.

50:27.880 --> 50:28.880
What's he playing World of Warcraft?

50:28.880 --> 50:29.880
It's on NBC10.com.

50:29.880 --> 50:31.880
I'll just read a little bit of the article.

50:31.880 --> 50:35.060
A 25-year-old North Philadelphia man has been charged with killing his young daughter.

50:35.060 --> 50:42.920
The mother said 17-month-old Alaya was violently punched by Tyrone Spellman over a video game.

50:42.920 --> 50:47.920
Reading further in the article, apparently, just being a cute little kid, she was pulling

50:47.920 --> 50:54.640
on the controller cord, playing with it, and the system fell, and he apparently was so

50:54.640 --> 50:57.960
upset he punched her in the face twice.

50:57.960 --> 51:01.760
When the mother came in to ask, because she was taking a nap.

51:01.760 --> 51:03.460
She didn't know anything was happening.

51:03.460 --> 51:09.360
When she got up to check on her daughter, she asked why she's not breathing, and he

51:09.360 --> 51:10.360
said, she's breathing.

51:10.360 --> 51:12.440
She's just asleep or something like that.

51:12.440 --> 51:21.000
She called the ambulance, and she was pronounced dead at the scene.

51:21.000 --> 51:22.720
Apparently this guy was supposed to be...

51:22.720 --> 51:29.640
They said that he was a fairly non-violent person, but first of all, I think the game

51:29.640 --> 51:31.280
has nothing to do with it.

51:31.280 --> 51:36.880
What if he had been playing, building a house of cards, and she knocked it over?

51:36.880 --> 51:42.180
If he's given to punch somebody over something, especially a child, over something so trivial,

51:42.180 --> 51:43.640
he would have done it over anything.

51:43.640 --> 51:46.040
There's some type of violent gene there.

51:46.040 --> 51:49.360
That's definitely, has nothing to do with a video game.

51:49.360 --> 51:52.040
That is one seriously, mentally fucked up person.

51:52.040 --> 51:56.400
On a completely unrelated note, five bucks says it was Madden.

51:56.400 --> 51:58.980
I kid, I kid, I kid.

51:58.980 --> 51:59.980
You can direct an email.

51:59.980 --> 52:04.560
Baby Tossing 2000, you know, on the Xbox 360 Arcade, apparently.

52:04.560 --> 52:07.000
It actually doesn't say what game it is.

52:07.000 --> 52:10.440
Nintendog Sniper 2006.

52:10.440 --> 52:14.520
The sad thing is that the lady was pregnant with another, she's eight months pregnant

52:14.520 --> 52:16.560
with another baby.

52:16.560 --> 52:19.040
The good news is he'll be the hell away from that one.

52:19.040 --> 52:20.880
Well, yeah, he is locked up.

52:20.880 --> 52:24.040
They're actually charging him with murder, endangering the welfare of a child, and possession

52:24.040 --> 52:26.200
of an instrument of crime.

52:26.200 --> 52:31.500
And but the thing that struck me is that the lady was saying that, you know, that her daughter

52:31.500 --> 52:34.160
is never going to meet her big sister.

52:34.160 --> 52:35.560
That was what got me on that.

52:35.560 --> 52:38.520
GS68 in our chat room says, I'll say it now.

52:38.520 --> 52:40.160
Shut up, Jack.

52:40.160 --> 52:43.880
Seriously, you know he's going to hop on that shit.

52:43.880 --> 52:48.940
But again, I don't think it was what he was doing so much.

52:48.940 --> 52:53.520
You know, if she had toppled over something else he might have been working on, if he

52:53.520 --> 52:59.640
was that mentally unstable to strike a child, you know, then he would have done it over

52:59.640 --> 53:01.640
anything.

53:01.640 --> 53:06.640
Well, I'm not sure how to transition into this story.

53:06.640 --> 53:11.640
I suppose I could say something about at least he didn't throw the Guitar Hero controller.

53:11.640 --> 53:12.640
I don't know.

53:12.640 --> 53:15.000
But this is a story on Guitar Hero 2.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.080
New song is announced for the game.

53:17.080 --> 53:21.880
Mega Death with Hangar 18 is supposedly going to be like the last final boss song in the

53:21.880 --> 53:22.880
game.

53:22.880 --> 53:23.880
Pretty rad.

53:23.880 --> 53:28.560
Aerosmith with Last Child, and this song I think is pretty cool coming to Guitar Hero

53:28.560 --> 53:29.560
2.

53:29.560 --> 53:31.760
Cheap Trick with Surrender.

53:31.760 --> 53:32.880
That's going to be kind of fun.

53:32.880 --> 53:33.880
I like that.

53:33.880 --> 53:36.440
They've already announced the one song I was most interested in, though.

53:36.440 --> 53:37.440
What the Spinal Tap?

53:37.440 --> 53:38.440
No, YYZ.

53:38.440 --> 53:39.440
Oh.

53:39.440 --> 53:40.440
Aren't you a big fan of the Spinal Tap?

53:40.440 --> 53:41.440
I love Rush.

53:41.440 --> 53:42.440
All right.

53:42.440 --> 53:43.440
Rush is cool.

53:43.440 --> 53:48.380
Anyways, I'm glad to see that Guitar Hero 2 seems to be on its way to being finished.

53:48.380 --> 53:54.200
Here's another game which supposedly is going to be finished pretty soon.

53:54.200 --> 53:58.580
Duke Nukem Forever is apparently in the polish stage.

53:58.580 --> 54:00.760
I don't know what that thought does that mean.

54:00.760 --> 54:02.080
The polish stage?

54:02.080 --> 54:07.280
It means that the physics and animation systems are virtually finished and shippable.

54:07.280 --> 54:10.020
It's simply maintenance and polish from here on out.

54:10.020 --> 54:15.200
We haven't needed to make substantial changes to those systems in months.

54:15.200 --> 54:18.040
I think they mean polishes and polishing a turd.

54:18.040 --> 54:19.400
The changes have been made.

54:19.400 --> 54:20.800
Sorry the game's delayed.

54:20.800 --> 54:27.080
We've all been too busy polishing our poles.

54:27.080 --> 54:32.640
Then he goes on to say, things are never as bleak as they appear, as often is the case

54:32.640 --> 54:35.880
when you simply have one side of the story.

54:35.880 --> 54:41.640
This is coming from 3D Realms president George Broussard.

54:41.640 --> 54:48.520
I don't know, I would think that a ten year delay on the game is pretty bleak if you ask

54:48.520 --> 54:49.520
me.

54:49.520 --> 54:51.520
It worked for Prey.

54:51.520 --> 54:53.080
No, it didn't really work for Prey.

54:53.080 --> 54:54.600
True said it worked for Prey.

54:54.600 --> 54:55.600
Prey?

54:55.600 --> 54:56.600
I don't think so.

54:56.600 --> 54:58.480
It wasn't that great of a game.

54:58.480 --> 54:59.480
Prey's kind of fun.

54:59.480 --> 55:05.480
It was kind of fun, but kind of fun isn't like, wow, ten years in the making.

55:05.480 --> 55:10.200
We'll see how the free expansion pack is that's supposedly coming.

55:10.200 --> 55:18.440
Well, you know how we're always bringing up some of our more quirky games?

55:18.440 --> 55:22.080
Well, Majesco is bringing Cake Mania to the DS.

55:22.080 --> 55:25.760
Did anybody get Cooking Mama?

55:25.760 --> 55:27.660
Actually wasn't Majesco talking about that game?

55:27.660 --> 55:31.320
I was looking at a Miggletop's copy of Cooking Mama, but I didn't get a chance to play it,

55:31.320 --> 55:32.320
but I hear it's kind of fun.

55:32.320 --> 55:35.320
Sorry, Cake Mania makes me think, you know, it makes me think of cooking.

55:35.320 --> 55:36.320
Sorry.

55:36.320 --> 55:42.920
They actually mentioned Cooking Mama in this, but they're actually bringing out Cake Mania.

55:42.920 --> 55:49.160
It's an online game from Sandlot Games, but Cake Mania will bring in the touch screen

55:49.160 --> 55:54.960
part so you can bake your cakes with extra touch power, I guess, but it will be the full

55:54.960 --> 55:59.420
game plus the Back to the Bakery expansion pack.

55:59.420 --> 56:04.760
So if anyone's into the weirdo quirk stuff, it will be coming out for 20 bucks.

56:04.760 --> 56:05.760
All right.

56:05.760 --> 56:09.980
It's developed by Digital Embryo, which I think is a cool name.

56:09.980 --> 56:13.640
Another series that Majesco is going to be bringing out, they have two titles in development

56:13.640 --> 56:14.980
for the Wii.

56:14.980 --> 56:18.800
One of them is Bust a Move, because that freaking game comes out on every console.

56:18.800 --> 56:23.720
Sorry, I meant the American Bust a Move or Puzzle Bobble, not the other Bust a Move that

56:23.720 --> 56:25.720
you guys are big fans of.

56:25.720 --> 56:31.040
The other one that they are bringing over is supposed to be a mystery title.

56:31.040 --> 56:33.800
It's going to be something that makes use of the Wiimote.

56:33.800 --> 56:37.960
Oh, I'm sorry, no, that's more on the Bust a Move, is that it will be using the Wiimote's

56:37.960 --> 56:38.960
motion.

56:38.960 --> 56:40.760
There is actually no other information about the other title.

56:40.760 --> 56:43.120
I wonder if it's not kind of a... Oh, no, because it's for the Wii.

56:43.120 --> 56:46.560
I was wondering if it was maybe the Cake Mania thing came out later or something, but I guess

56:46.560 --> 56:47.560
not.

56:47.560 --> 56:48.880
There's ones for the DS and ones for the Wii.

56:48.880 --> 56:52.480
So we should have more information pretty soon.

56:52.480 --> 56:57.240
Anyway, that's going to bring to an end this part B of our podcast.

56:57.240 --> 56:59.640
I know you guys are thinking, wait a minute, you haven't taken calls yet.

56:59.640 --> 57:01.280
You haven't done last minute stories yet.

57:01.280 --> 57:06.040
Well, tonight, guys, for our very special episode number 200, we're going to be doing

57:06.040 --> 57:08.880
a part C. So we're going to go to a quick break here.

57:08.880 --> 57:11.720
We'll come back with Orange Launch Radio part C, and I'll tell you what, part C is going

57:11.720 --> 57:15.080
to be very different tonight because we're going to do a little bit of gaming news and

57:15.080 --> 57:19.580
then it's about us and kind of celebrating 200 episodes of Orange Launch Radio and taking

57:19.580 --> 57:20.580
your calls.

57:20.580 --> 57:25.120
We've got a lot to take a look at, and it will all be on Orange Launch Radio part C

57:25.120 --> 57:27.840
right after this.

57:27.840 --> 57:29.440
How does it all end?

57:29.440 --> 57:43.680
Find out later this week when part C of episode 200 hits our podcast feed.
