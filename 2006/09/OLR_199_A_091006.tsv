14150	25167	Tonight, September 10th, 2006, Sony screws over Europe and then some, Chips for the Wii have been in production for a while now, and we premiere new DDR songs in our DDR sneak peeks.
32745	36926	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36966	45109	We are that independent video game podcast dedicated to video games that don't suck and video game culture and the gamer lifestyle.
45429	46369	I'm here to help you through it.
46409	47429	My name is Rob Roberts.
47449	48470	You might know me as Sky.
48530	55152	Joining me as always, say hello to my lovely co-host in that corner, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
55452	55712	Hello.
56132	56993	How you doing, Missy?
57713	59114	Um, I'm doing okay.
59274	60195	I love your new shirt.
60215	60535	Thank you.
60555	63156	Will you please share with the listeners what your new shirt is and where you got this?
63537	64717	Um, what was that place called, Chris?
64957	65918	Oh, God, I forgot.
65938	68260	It was someplace on, um, Hate.
68520	71161	Apparently it's called Oh, God, I Forgot is the name of the store.
71702	77405	But on the front it says, Oh, Army, and the back it says Dark Sakura with a zero like a team jersey, and it's red and black.
78826	82268	I want to get one and it's going to say Rob Roberts and the number 69.
82308	84209	That would be awesome.
85110	85310	All right.
85985	87766	Oh, also over there, Loki, what's your number going to be?
87806	88547	Techmaster Loki.
89928	91810	I guess 13 would be cool.
92330	92710	13 would be cool.
92730	94111	Or 666 would be good for you.
94852	97454	No, we don't want to have too many sixes because, you know.
98257	101559	The six and nine both are kind of like sixes, and then I'd have 666.
102199	103020	That'd just be too weird.
103100	104841	That makes no sense at all, but I like your shirt.
105101	106742	You have a shirt that says Vader was framed.
107182	110804	Yeah, this I got as a gift from Eric and Melissa.
111145	111985	All right, sounds good.
112746	113966	Happy early birthday.
114126	114607	Thank you.
115487	119089	Matt's birthday is tomorrow, September 11th, a day that is easy to remember.
119129	122351	I mean, I never forget Matt's birthday because it's easier to remember for some reason.
122371	125113	Yeah, because if you forget, we'll drive another plane into a tower.
126943	128204	Moving right along.
129165	130666	My birthday was the Waco deal.
148427	149067	How you doing, Chris?
149347	149808	I'm okay.
150028	152549	I got here kind of late and I fucked up your intro.
152589	153209	That's okay.
153289	154410	By bringing you crack.
154490	159292	The podcast listeners don't know that because we edit the show when we fuck up.
159312	159592	Oh, okay.
159772	160573	That's all right.
160593	162494	Well, podcast listeners, he fucked up.
162534	164875	We had a faulty start this evening, but that's all right.
165475	169017	Say hello as well to a moldy favorite, Drunami.
169317	171538	Yeah, you have to ask what my number is going to be.
171898	172698	I'm Drunami.
172738	173699	Yes, I'm Drunami.
173719	173759	Ah!
175495	177116	I played Tetris on Kristen's DS while having our hair done.
201078	203981	I've never played DS while getting my hair done, but that's a good thought.
204201	205082	I was processing.
205322	207764	Do you have to put your hair on one of those giant dryers where you can't hear anything?
207784	208124	No, she did.
208404	208644	Oh, okay.
208865	209165	Oh, you did?
209385	216451	But it was while he touched up my roots, and I have actually a black streak now on either side, but you can't tell because I have my hair pulled back.
217091	221515	But I was sitting there playing Tetris, and I couldn't see.
222055	224217	I had it right up in front of my face because I'm blind.
224917	226659	And so I ended up...
228766	229647	Just playing that.
229747	231008	And actually, I play pinball.
232048	232969	Did you guys get a new machine?
232989	234150	We got a new machine.
234410	239434	We have Star Trek The Next Generation and Dan's apparently been working on it the whole time I've been gone.
240955	241275	Right on.
243016	244257	Loki, anything you've been playing this week?
245758	247199	I played Saints Row.
248635	253116	I was bored during lunch one day, so I tried climbing the mountain that's on the side of the map.
253596	255877	Apparently, there's an invisible wall, so you can't do that.
255997	262898	But I was really high in the air, so I decided to shoot rockets down at cars, because that's, of course, the only thing you want to do if you're really high up in the air.
263378	264359	So I did that, and that was fun.
265579	267139	And what else did I do?
267679	269880	Oh, I finished Blazing Angels, finally.
269900	274821	I have all 1,000 achievement points now for it, so I can sell it back.
275441	278202	That game you hate that you talk about in this segment...
278582	280904	Every single week for like the past 15 weeks.
281625	281965	I hate it.
282285	283106	I really do hate it.
283286	283906	But you know what?
284087	284607	It's done.
285228	285528	So...
286721	288502	The talk of a true achievement point score.
288522	290644	Hey, I have a question when it comes to achievement points.
291184	295588	Like, I was looking at one of those sites that has, like, the leaderboards and will show you everybody's gamer score.
295608	298150	I think it was, like, mygamercard.net is a big site that has that.
298530	302953	And, like, the person with the most points has, like, 53,000 gamers points.
303494	307037	How does anyone on Earth have the time to get that many points?
307197	312020	They all have a job and they live at home and they just play games all day, all night.
312261	313622	Wow, that's kind of sad.
313802	315383	Yeah, it's ridiculous, but...
316042	318643	Whatever, I mean, if they want to spend the time to do that.
318763	325044	I'm not crazy like that, but I do like, if I'm going to sell a game back, I do want to make sure I have all the points out of it.
325584	332005	Or, in the case of the outfit, I just don't fucking care because the game's so awful that I'll just sell it back without even touching it.
332265	334126	I mean, so whatever.
334366	338887	We have another guest that's always with us every week, and that is our chat room, available at orangeonstrater.com.
338907	341727	Click on chat, and VidPala has a comment to all this.
341827	345548	Gamer points are like the new E-peen, as in E-penis, so...
346325	348368	Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
365367	366547	because that's essential.
368828	369668	What else have I been playing?
369848	371049	I've played some live arcade stuff.
371249	375570	I've actually been playing more like Galaga and stuff.
377350	381871	Nelly's been playing a lot of Bejeweled 2, so I stole one of the games from her and I played that.
382372	385112	That was pretty much it, though.
385492	391254	I want to play more online for Saints Row, but I'm waiting for the patch to come out because it's supposed to be soon.
392250	398712	You know, I saw you online this week, you know, on Xbox, as you can see, and I saw you were playing Bejeweled 2, and I was like, loser.
399612	402193	That's because it's Nelly, she keeps playing Bejeweled 2.
402473	409354	And then I go to, I went to majornelson.com, and he has like the list of the, you know, the top Xbox games, and now he's doing the arcade games too.
409754	414996	And Bejeweled 2 is like number 11, 13, somewhere around there, and I'm like, losers.
416216	417296	So, yeah.
417356	419837	I mean, Bejeweled was cool, like five years ago.
420914	421174	Impulse?
421194	422055	It's the game she likes.
422095	422635	The only game.
422675	424657	She was playing Chloe and Clyde though earlier this week too.
424677	428579	Which is impressive because that's like the game that you cannot get those gamer points.
428799	429020	Ever.
429140	430340	It's damn impossible.
430481	433202	The Bejeweled 2 has the hardest gamer points of any Xbox game I've played.
433503	433783	Period.
434944	435364	I don't get it.
435424	436364	I was looking at the leaderboards.
436384	439306	There was someone that did 250 levels of the main game.
439326	440507	I'm like, how do you even do that?
440807	441908	That's one hell of a lucky game.
441988	442368	Cheats.
442789	443009	Yeah.
444190	445130	So, yeah.
445491	445811	Whatever.
446871	447192	Alrighty.
447832	449153	Let's go over to Drew Nami.
449173	450434	Drew Nami, how was your gaming week?
451314	452635	I played Bejeweled.
454336	454857	For real?
455257	455877	For real.
456137	457058	Are you a loser?
457218	457699	No, I'm kidding.
457979	461381	I don't want to... Look, people play casual games and that's okay.
461461	462722	It's just, you know... I was bored.
462882	469787	If you own an Xbox 360 and the only thing you're playing on it is Bejeweled, something's wrong.
470327	472969	Aside from that, I was kicking it semi-old school.
472989	477873	I was playing Space Channel 5 and Disgaea and the usual WoW.
477893	479294	Are you going to be getting the new Disgaea?
480414	481035	When I have the money.
482215	485236	It's already out, but I want to finish the original Disgaea first.
485836	490739	I haven't played the new Disgaea, I've just heard that it's almost just like the first one.
490879	493821	It just kind of seamlessly picks up and moves on.
494021	494961	Why change a good thing?
495682	500744	And there's still Prinny's in it, and apparently there is a cameo of Etna in it.
501265	501445	Cool.
503106	503706	Looks to be good.
504046	506527	So anything else besides the wow and the bejeweled?
507628	509008	Like I said, Space Channel 5.
509348	510109	Oh, hot.
510289	511109	I love Space Channel 5.
511449	513810	Reminds me how much my short-term memory sucks.
515550	516531	I'm sorry, what were we talking about?
517151	518151	Your gaming week?
518311	518792	Alright, anyway.
520312	523013	My gaming week, because I forgot, I haven't talked about mine yet.
523333	524474	I haven't played anything new.
524574	528275	There really wasn't a lot new this week I wanted to buy, so it's really most the same stuff.
528295	530576	I don't have any new reviews for you guys this week, just because...
531291	531852	Ruler Rose Ruler Rose
546371	549675	It's being promoted as this Silent Hill-esque kind of game.
550476	552940	And for the most part, that would be an accurate way to describe it.
552980	555283	If you're into the Silent Hill games, you'll probably like Rule of Rose.
555803	563193	It's historically based a little bit, so it kind of takes place in the 20s, and I think it's supposed to be actually based on this old story.
563433	564194	Are there giant crabs?
564694	565955	Are there giant crabs?
585080	586841	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
615023	615643	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
632506	633166	Thanks for watching!
652148	653129	Thank you for watching!
667782	671383	In Castlevania 3, actually, there's a lot of parts that weren't in the castle.
671483	674104	And in Dracula X. Look, shut your mouth.
674304	676464	Okay, okay, let's just put it this way.
676804	683506	The first Metroidvania where you can legitimately go outside the castle for an extended period of time.
684226	685346	I like Metroidvania.
685366	687067	Weren't we talking about Rule of Rose?
687127	690288	How did this turn into Bash Rob's Gamer Cred here somehow?
690388	692428	It's always Bash Rob's Gamer Cred.
692468	694009	No, only on message boards, sorry.
695029	695409	So anyways.
696125	697126	It was a pretty fun game.
697246	697667	I liked it.
697727	701751	It's very strange, and I think it's one of those games that you're not going to understand what's going on until the very end.
702031	703953	What did you think of having the dog element?
703973	707216	Because that's where it really differs from Silent Hill, is that you have this partner.
707416	713802	About 30 minutes to an hour into the game, you get this partner that helps you, this dog, that will seek out items.
713822	715304	It kind of adds a real interesting element to the game.
715644	734039	It is an interesting element, and to be honest, I didn't realize how important it was because you can actually find a lot of hidden weapons and items that way by searching out different things, and you can get some really super powerful weapons if you actually spend the time to use the dog to find different items that seem useless, but you trade them in for better stuff.
734679	741825	So the dog is pretty cool, and it also kind of simplifies things because it makes it simple to find where you're supposed to go.
741845	743487	You just have the dog sniff out stuff.
744389	747950	The creatures in it are very creepy, though.
748030	752471	All these kind of golem or imp kind of characters.
752791	759592	There's children that have no faces, basically, and they're just kind of, I don't know how to describe them, really.
759692	760492	Just creepy looking.
760712	765053	So with the dog element, we're talking like Silent Hill meets Secret of Evermore?
765253	771895	No, it's more like Silent Hill meets Haunting Ground.
773888	778171	You know, the way I'll test if a game is scary or not is I'll make Christopher's sister play it, my roommate.
778491	783595	I'll make his sister play it because, like, seriously, this is the girl, and she's not here right now so I can talk a little shit.
784095	792020	This is the girl who cried while fighting a Silent Hill 3 boss because she couldn't take it because the boss would run around her and then try to slash her so she started crying.
792060	792441	Which one was it?
793462	794444	I don't remember the name.
794884	795786	I don't remember the name involved.
795826	796447	Is that on Hill 2?
796647	796888	No, on 3.
797288	798190	If I'm on the rooftop.
798631	799092	Oh, yeah.
799312	800354	Okay, yeah.
801275	802577	Like, she cried a lot.
802818	805823	So if I want to test if a game is scary or not, I'll make her play it.
805863	807085	So I made her play Ruler Rose.
807441	807881	And she did.
807921	808501	She freaked out.
808521	810302	She threw the controller on the ground in a few parts.
810322	811182	She's like, I'm not going to play!
811242	811762	I'm not going to play!
811802	812582	And then she picks it up again.
812882	815703	So the scare factor is definitely there if you're a big girl.
815763	816623	No, no, no, no, no.
816783	817383	I got that beat.
818464	820384	We were playing Fatal Frame.
821684	823345	One of my friends and I, we were playing Fatal Frame.
823705	829106	I could not even get her to walk the few feet in the fog because I was freaking out.
829706	831307	And nothing was happening and I was freaking out.
831727	832367	I got that beat.
832487	836168	You know, Fatal Frame is the one scary series I could not get into for some reason.
836428	836828	I don't know why.
839371	843292	How many of us that are playing the first Resident Evil freaked out when the dogs crashed through the window?
843352	845413	I freaked out at the horrible voiceovers.
847193	849034	I hope that is not Chris's blood.
849054	851555	Actually, my first Resident Evil was 2 for some reason.
851615	853035	I kind of missed the boat a little bit.
853135	853856	But anyway, sorry.
854256	855937	Rulerose, final thoughts on Rulerose.
856137	856977	I really like it.
857717	862079	It is probably one of the games I've actually played a lot of recently.
862719	864039	At least almost all the way through.
864059	865560	And definitely one that I haven't really
866578	870042	I haven't really played that many games on the PlayStation 2 lately, so I recommend picking it up.
870523	872485	The only thing it sucks about is its full price.
872545	872806	It's like $49.99.
874888	881376	But if you're really into those kind of niche horror games, it's going to be pretty good for you.
881806	885569	Yeah, if you like adventure, horror-type games, Ruler Rose is going to be right up your alley.
885589	886670	It's got a great soundtrack, too.
886710	888091	I forgot to say, the soundtrack is phenomenal.
888111	889132	The soundtrack is awesome.
889192	891174	It's actually done by the people that did Panzer Dragoon.
891254	892535	It's a phenomenal soundtrack.
892575	893315	I was very impressed.
893556	905045	And what's even cool about the whole thing is once you're done with the game, if you do look up, if you read on message boards and stuff about the backstory to it, it makes it even creepier, just the whole thing, because it's based on real life.
906066	906446	Sort of.
906486	907527	It's based on real events.
907587	908067	How about that?
908247	908588	Yeah.
909088	917632	The gameplay itself I wouldn't call super original and it's a weird entry for sort of what's starting to, you know, we're wrapping down this generation of games.
917932	920313	But overall I would recommend it to fans of the genre.
920353	922174	And the animation in it is really good too.
922654	923994	I would recommend it to fans of the genre.
924014	924875	I think you guys will be pleased.
925635	928438	All right, shall we get into some gaming news tonight then?
928538	930920	Oh, first, quick housekeeping before we get into gaming news.
931300	939887	I just wanted to say, if you missed the announcement on our website, we have relaunched the Dance Dance Revolution sneak peeks, and they start tonight.
940087	946753	And the good news is, even though it was delayed a week, good things come to those who wait, it will be a part of the podcast.
946913	949215	You don't have to just listen live to hear the songs.
949554	950354	So this is amazing.
950394	954136	We're really excited to be working with Konami of Hawaii to play some new songs for you.
954196	956297	We'll get to that shortly after some news.
956797	957918	You know what else is amazing?
958018	958218	What?
958358	959499	Well, actually, what's not amazing?
959559	959759	What?
959899	960559	Ken Kuragi.
961740	962040	Why?
962060	962840	What did he do now?
962860	971424	In the news today, he got a new bicycle helmet because he chewed through his strap on his last one and ended up throwing up crayons all over the place.
972871	973932	Mac PowerBook
992492	993613	Pro, or whatever it's called.
993913	995754	The latest, whatever the most expensive thing is.
995994	997636	MacBook Pro, whatever the most expensive thing is.
998216	1005361	And for those of you who like the Sims 2 games on the Mac, go out and get Open for Business.
1005921	1013206	Because in the last few games of the Sims 2, it slows, like the computer just lags it to death.
1013546	1019350	Like anything, any animation, any huge thing that the game does, it's lagged and stuff like that.
1020010	1022012	And Out to Lunch, they completely take care of that.
1022772	1023913	and LightLeanFast.com
1044171	1044932	I like killing puppies.
1044952	1045593	I like killing puppies.
1069960	1071521	Please no hate mail for the pet lovers.
1071961	1072681	No, no, no, no, no.
1073681	1076242	If you kill the pets... Oh, it's a rumor, actually.
1076603	1081405	If you kill the pets, they get a little tombstone, and they walk around as ghosts.
1081585	1082345	It's hilarious.
1082505	1086647	Every time I hear about dead pets now, I can't help but think about... Madonna!
1086807	1088447	My precious Madonna!
1088627	1089448	Oh, my God.
1089628	1092669	I cheered when that lady got chewed on.
1096738	1098819	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1127896	1142990	Sony has made an official statement saying that they are, to quote, the delay in mass production schedule of the blue laser diode within the Sony group, thus affecting the timely procurement of key components to be utilized in PlayStation 3.
1144011	1149977	So, in Europe, Russia, Middle East, Africa, and Australia, we'll have to wait until March to get a PS3.
1150658	1152659	However, it is on track to launch...
1153604	1157266	in Japan on November 11th, and in North America on November 17th.
1157627	1162129	So basically, by the time you all get it overseas, we're going to tell you how much it sucks already.
1163510	1167573	So essentially, Sony just gave Europe the finger this week, essentially.
1168166	1171508	Not just Europe, that whole chunk of the world.
1171568	1175650	Sorry, but yeah, everything on that side of the ocean pretty much got the shaft.
1176730	1182974	Their plan, though, is to still ship 6 million PS3s globally by the end of the 2007 fiscal year.
1183254	1186796	Is this a surprise, though, that this has been delayed?
1186836	1188016	I think a lot of us saw this coming.
1188136	1189417	The rumors were out before.
1190497	1197181	Actually, before they made the announcement that there was a shortage with their shipment, so...
1198322	1216517	Hmm, that's kind of funny, you know, because when you don't, I don't know, start production on a console yet, yeah, it's probably going to be delayed, but it's also, you know, not a surprise since the announcement of the delay that they're going to be limited on the quantities that they're going to have for the other two territories that they're actually launching on time, and that would be both Japan and North America.
1216857	1218879	What's interesting, though, is that the U.S.
1218939	1222642	is getting 400,000 units at launch, and Japan's only getting 100,000.
1222762	1227406	Now, I don't know about you guys, but I figured that Sony, with the
1227722	1235008	I figured that Japan, you know, is pretty rabid Sony fans, and I would have figured they would give them more units than just 100,000, but I don't know.
1235028	1236929	Is that because of the population difference or something?
1236949	1246898	I think what it is, I think what it is maybe, population difference, also the fact that they have probably a better, they want to have more ground on the U.S.
1247058	1252122	front instead of Japan, because right now, Japan, the 360 isn't doing very well, so.
1252722	1253243	Interesting.
1253403	1254103	But, yeah.
1256419	1257980	Is Sony screwed because of this?
1258080	1260480	I mean, seriously, guys, I was thinking this week.
1260840	1266302	I'm like, you know, I didn't buy a PlayStation 2 until it was already out for a year.
1267542	1273063	And the PlayStation 1, I didn't even blink an eye at until they started getting some of the games I was really interested in on it.
1273463	1276084	So could the PlayStation 3 simply repeat that?
1276144	1280105	Or maybe we're all giving it a hard time because we're all focused on the launch right now.
1280165	1283466	But in a year, could the PlayStation 3 maybe be a good console?
1283686	1287808	To be honest, I mean, what, the 360 launched with almost the same amount of units.
1288448	1293851	So, I don't see that being as big of a deal as the fact that it's $600.
1295172	1303676	And, you know, right now, like they released their first commercial or kind of mini movies that they're going to be advertising it in the UK with.
1304316	1308859	And their big advertisement is, yeah, the AI in games, guess what?
1309199	1311140	It's not just, you know, it's better.
1312424	1313225	Of the 400,000, how many will work?
1331479	1332600	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1354783	1363773	So their standalone Blu-ray player is probably going to be delayed because there's no diodes for it, obviously, since they can't even make enough for the PlayStation 3.
1364434	1365835	What's that going to do for Blu-ray?
1366376	1370400	That's the big thing, because if they get enough of those HD DVD players out there...
1371141	1373163	Then, you know, that might be a problem.
1373663	1374584	But then again, I don't know.
1374604	1379589	I think they use even the same diodes on the HD DVD players, so... Who knows?
1379809	1386054	Comment from JeremyTodd1 in chat, With such an extreme shortage, I wonder how high prices for the PS3 will get on eBay.
1386214	1387255	And here's the other thing, too.
1387756	1395743	Remember, you know, back in spring when it was supposedly, you know, that PlayStation 3 was going to launch, and, you know, oh yeah, we're on track, we're on track.
1396303	1396803	Yes or no and why?
1423389	1427272	No, because they're going to miss out on their Christmas, and I think that would be death for them.
1427573	1436000	They need to have their console out there, even if it's going to be limited numbers, because if anything, it'll sell out, people will want it because it's sold out, and there you go.
1436840	1437301	DarkSakura?
1438322	1440724	That's pretty much my assessment on the same thing.
1440764	1444347	I mean, people want what they can't have, basically.
1445307	1445447	Okay.
1445467	1446628	Dranami?
1446729	1446809	Okay.
1447806	1448167	Ditto.
1448267	1452972	The shortage is just going to create more demand, so, you know, why mess up a good marketing strategy?
1453532	1456796	Even though the commercials are much akin to, I don't know, polishing a turd.
1456816	1459018	Okay, Chris, should Sony delay?
1459058	1459398	Yes or no?
1460419	1460700	No.
1460960	1462642	They at least need to get the Christmas stuff out there.
1462842	1464644	I mean, that thought whole market and stuff like that.
1464664	1466606	So pretty much what everyone else said.
1467987	1468807	Okay, I'm going to be brave.
1468827	1469428	I'm going to say yes.
1469608	1477152	I think Sony ought to delay at this point because the games, the lineup games could get stronger for launch because you've seen all these games getting shuffled around the launch window.
1477552	1481815	They would still get the console out by the end of their fiscal year and they could have a stronger launch.
1481955	1484256	I think people are going to buy these systems Christmas or not.
1484576	1487578	I think the same people are going to buy the systems no matter what time of year you launch.
1487898	1496263	I realize there's this huge thing to want to get the spoiled kids around Christmas, but those spoiled kids will find an excuse to get their systems in April or March if they want to release them.
1496283	1496803	Hold on a sec.
1497659	1512165	What I think is, why would developers be so brave as to dev new games after the launch titles if the system hasn't been sold yet and the launch titles haven't caught on and so the PS3 hasn't caught on?
1512606	1514867	Who's going to be brave enough to dev games for that?
1516367	1517608	Alright.
1517668	1519128	Interesting thoughts from chat as well.
1519369	1526812	Jeremy Tom 1 says, the huge problem with this though is that a few people will get a PS3 and then their friends will see it and they might decide that the graphics aren't much different from the 360 and
1527554	1528334	and they'll go buy a 360 instead.
1548345	1549626	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1577968	1580130	The system is only as good as the games that are on it.
1594918	1595819	You know what?
1596339	1604043	I'm sorry, I don't have a lot of money to drop on a game system if there's not going to be a game that I want.
1604423	1611507	I'm a very big Disney fan, so I bought a PS2 for the sole purpose of playing Kingdom Hearts.
1611587	1618170	And I've discovered other games that I like about it, but unless they make a game that I want, I'm not going to drop that much money on it.
1618450	1619471	The Wii does look interesting, though.
1619998	1623782	Megsies in chat and says there's no reason to get a PS3 at launch.
1623822	1625985	The only exclusive games worth getting will be out in 2007-2008.
1626265	1629589	Metal Gear Solid 4, Final Fantasy 13, and so on.
1629929	1632292	That's kind of how I felt about the PlayStation 2, to be honest.
1632372	1633874	I mean, what was I going to buy at launch?
1633934	1634474	Fantavision?
1634554	1635956	There is some good games.
1635976	1637578	Fantavision was sort of fun.
1638198	1639158	Was it like Lair?
1639479	1640979	Is it Miklatov or Jamie in here?
1640999	1641459	I'm not sure.
1641479	1642600	It was sort of fun.
1643120	1647062	I would say there are some good first party games, or exclusive games I should say.
1647262	1650143	Lair and Resistance Fall of Man look pretty good.
1651303	1658386	But then again, you know, I haven't seen them in... I think after Tokyo Game Show we'll get a better gauge of how good the games are going to be.
1659227	1665689	And they're going to have to start marketing this thing pretty soon because convincing someone why they need to buy a $600 console is going to be
1668393	1671195	Pretty difficult, so we'll have to wait and see.
1671895	1673336	Alright, well, moving on.
1673476	1678980	One thing that will be available around the PS3 launch, you know, if you can't afford a PlayStation 3, which most of us can't.
1679380	1680921	And by the way, you know what, Europe?
1681402	1682222	I'll do you a favor.
1682423	1687106	I am not going to buy a PlayStation 3 until you guys are able to buy PlayStation 3s.
1687426	1688927	Which is easy, because I wasn't going to get one anyway.
1688987	1691969	But we can call this a protest now.
1692009	1693290	It makes it really easy, so...
1695129	1698291	Honestly, Europe, I don't think you guys are missing much.
1698431	1699392	I mean, that's kind of how I feel.
1699492	1700713	I don't want one of these at launch.
1700753	1709199	I mean, I guess maybe I feel bad for the person who really, really does in Europe that can't have one now, but... Well, you know what?
1709399	1711221	I mean, couldn't they just import?
1712021	1721028	Because, I mean, granted... Because the games are supposed to be region-free, and... We haven't really had super final confirmation on that, though.
1721048	1721908	You know, that could have changed.
1722228	1722669	However...
1723670	1734576	There's still the, unless, somebody's just going to say, you know, give a big F you to format, because you still have the difference between NTSC and PAL.
1735817	1736578	Oh, that's a good point.
1736938	1740520	Unless they're just going to say, screw all you, it's high definition or NTSC only.
1741620	1742801	But I don't think that's right.
1742821	1743481	That would really be murder.
1743501	1747704	That would really put aside a large market of business.
1748146	1750387	Alright, well, anyway, sorry, I got off on a tangent.
1750407	1757591	I meant to say that something that will be available when the PlayStation 3 launches in November is the PSP download service.
1758311	1763393	Original PlayStation games will be downloadable, and the PSP has no problem running them via an emulator.
1763413	1768056	This is all coming from Sony's head of platform development in Japan, Izumi Kawanishi.
1768996	1775219	Kawanishi is also saying that the PSP download service will have movies as well as full original PlayStation games.
1775526	1778027	And it will launch at the same time as the PlayStation 3.
1779468	1780188	And that's about it.
1780208	1780768	That's all they said.
1781128	1783809	Well, you can't download retail movies yet.
1783829	1787051	You can get, you know, like vodcasts and things using little hacks.
1787431	1791612	But Sony has yet to really support full-blown movies.
1791992	1795114	And, you know, obviously they're going to be releasing the digital rights management and all this stuff.
1795134	1797975	And I guess trying to salvage some of what they've lost on UMD.
1798115	1798455	I don't know.
1799244	1799945	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1819793	1820933	That's the secret, Sony.
1820993	1823774	Just put out the UMDs and sell them a little cheaper than what you're doing.
1824074	1829235	Make them cheaper than DVDs, and I think they'll be a lot more appealing to a lot of people very quick.
1829475	1830435	And you'll sell PSPs.
1831075	1832776	But what do I know?
1832796	1834176	I'm just some schmo on the internet.
1834456	1834856	Exactly.
1835636	1837997	Well, I didn't want to say exactly, but anyways.
1838797	1843998	Some other things that are possibly in the works right now would be a Sony PlayStation phone.
1844718	1844858	And...
1847363	1854348	When I saw this, I was thinking, oh god, please not another N-Gage, because that's just horrible.
1854768	1871080	But, apparently, according to Sony Ericsson's Senior Vice President of Product and Application Planning, Riko Sakaguchi, the company is working on something related to the PlayStation phone, and says the surprise...
1871983	1872444	VoiceOverIP
1895903	1896824	The phone station.
1897044	1901647	I think what I like about the PSP a lot is that it really is kind of this all-in-one system.
1901707	1903769	It kind of is the leg up that it has on the DS.
1903829	1914156	It seems like the DS, while it has a lot of solid games that are innovative, it's kind of having to catch up in the department of having a web browser, playing MP3s, and all this other stuff that a PSP does.
1914196	1914616	You know what I mean?
1915362	1920246	But wouldn't you rather have a system that you know is going to play a good game?
1920606	1922227	That you know they put effort into?
1922487	1927250	Well, what if I'm more of the casual gamer who maybe that's not my biggest focus on the system?
1928551	1931313	DS sales are still kicking PSP.
1931694	1932995	Don't get me wrong.
1933575	1936637	It's interesting, all these things that kind of distinguish the PSP a little bit.
1936997	1943282	I think they're all cool, but the market is showing people aren't interested in all that as much as they are in just having good games.
1944723	1944983	Okay.
1947201	1953384	Well, speaking of good games, there is something coming on to PSP that I will definitely be all over.
1955425	1957566	Parappa the Rapper is coming on to PSP.
1959807	1961487	In the rain or in the snow?
1962468	1963868	Got the funky, funky float.
1964488	1965249	Crack, butter.
1967990	1969371	No, don't even get me started on TV.
1969391	1971251	Check and turn and signal to the left.
1971351	1972772	Sorry, love Parappa, love it.
1974868	1981631	There's not really an official announcement yet, but the game was recently featured in Famitsu.
1983492	1990815	So the talk is that we are pretty much going to be getting a proper, and actually that makes sense because they did Guitar Room Man.
1991767	1997248	And they're starting to put out a bit more music and, you know, slash quirky games on the PSP.
1997369	1999389	So, my hope is that this does come to pass.
1999489	2002830	And so this isn't just a port of the PS1 thing on the download service.
2002850	2004570	This is like a whole new frickin' thing.
2004850	2005591	That's the rumor.
2006011	2007031	Wow, that would be hot.
2007051	2008671	Because Parappa kind of disappeared for a while.
2008932	2012833	Granted, Parappa the Rapper 2 wasn't quite as good as 1, at least commercially.
2012853	2013653	We need an own Jammer Lamy.
2014053	2014753	Yeah, I know.
2014773	2016073	We need to bring this series back.
2016113	2016754	That would be awesome.
2017394	2017574	Well...
2019131	2021733	Parappa is not the only thing rumored to be coming back for the PSP.
2022333	2031300	Electronic Arts has confirmed that they are doing an EA Replay collection, and this will be a budget series of adventures for those folks that would be interested in this.
2031360	2033722	Get this, the types of games that are going to be in the EA Replay.
2034262	2046788	Syndicate, Ultima 7, The Black Gate, Road Rash 1 through 3, Wing Commander, and some other interesting titles such as Desert Strike, Jungle Strike, Virtual Pinball, Mutant League Football.
2047208	2048869	That would be very interesting.
2049249	2052991	But they haven't said anything about that they're going to upgrade the graphics.
2053031	2055392	These may just be straight up ports, but still there's something...
2055892	2058093	Oddly appealing about being able to play Wing Commander on the go.
2058113	2062154	I think they were supposed to be ports of the Super Nintendo and Genesis versions.
2062314	2063394	Oh, that would be a crap.
2063474	2065695	If it's just a port of the Genesis, forget it.
2066675	2067695	It's all about the PC one.
2067715	2069076	But Ultima 7 wasn't on PC.
2069916	2073837	I mean... Whoops, Ultima 7 was only on PC, wasn't it?
2074277	2076938	They ported 6 to Super Nintendo.
2076958	2077558	They didn't do 7.
2077678	2078998	They didn't port 7.
2079939	2081579	So there must be some PC things involved.
2082359	2082639	Who knows.
2083220	2083480	Anyways...
2085114	2085774	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2107277	2109558	I just have a really hard time believing that it's cancelled on 360.
2110598	2115059	Seeing as they've already kind of worked on Chromehounds.
2116019	2120420	But anyways, it's supposed to be coming out in spring of next year.
2121900	2127801	Yet another reason why waiting until March maybe isn't such a bad idea for the PlayStation 3.
2129282	2134703	In regards to other games and the PlayStation 3, Enchanted Arms is actually going to be out on the PlayStation 3.
2139308	2140489	I don't know how I feel about that.
2140569	2141649	I mean, I picked up Enchanted Arms.
2141689	2142490	I haven't played it yet.
2142930	2143770	I think you're going to enjoy it.
2143830	2144450	I think you'll enjoy it.
2144610	2149832	I've had a lot of good... You know, it took me a while to get into the game, but it's really good.
2150092	2158255	I mean, it's not the best RPG I've ever played, but it's a very good first next-gen experience for RPGs.
2158536	2167599	I was just thinking it was good to have such a solid... You know, apparently a solid game on the 360, and just that it's coming out on the PlayStation 3, just sort of like... No.
2167619	2167659	No.
2168924	2169925	It seems like it's a little late.
2170425	2174889	By the time it comes out for the PlayStation 3, it'll be like, oh, well, next-gen RPGs are going to be old news.
2175229	2176750	I guess it depends when it comes out.
2176790	2180373	I mean, if Enchanted Arms is coming out at launch, well, that might not be a bad thing.
2180653	2185696	That could be pretty good for Sony, but it doesn't seem like it would be out in time for launch if it's just now being announced.
2186277	2186557	I don't know.
2186897	2188018	Nah, probably not.
2188598	2191200	I mean, they already have Oblivion coming out, so that's pretty good.
2191520	2191841	That's true.
2192101	2195003	Maybe if they could redo all the voiceovers, then it wouldn't be so bad.
2195884	2196444	I don't think they would.
2196829	2197550	I don't think they would.
2197570	2198510	It would be just a port.
2199511	2200292	I don't think they would either.
2200732	2205776	Well, one other thing you're going to be missing out on on the PlayStation 3 rumors now is that
2206961	2211183	1080p is actually not really going to be used in games as much as you think.
2211784	2220208	According to Sony, the official US PlayStation 3 site says that the HDMI connection is required for 1080p signals in Blu-ray movies.
2220908	2227271	Sony's made an issue of pointing out that 1080p, which the Xbox 360 is incapable of, is the holy grail of full HD.
2227811	2231193	The only game that's running in 1080p, though, is Gran Turismo HD.
2231273	2233154	This was just a tech demo that was created
2233554	2235675	Not really a full game that's running yet.
2263621	2269689	Maybe this is something that would be more at the PlayStation 3's end of cycle, that you'd start seeing more 1080p games.
2270069	2278260	Like how on Xbox, the first Xbox, before the 360, you started seeing in the end some games start to come out in high def towards the end.
2278941	2281925	And in widescreen especially, you started seeing a lot more widescreen games on Xbox.
2282247	2283408	and then you start to see like burnout.
2283428	2285070	Wasn't one of the burnouts towards the end in 720p?
2285230	2285851	Yeah.
2286371	2290716	So maybe 1080p is just something that will be more utilized later down the road.
2290796	2297863	But wait, are you guys seeing that Sony was lying when they said that they can do 1080p at 120 frames per second?
2297943	2298904	Well, in one game.
2300546	2301547	Fucking retarded.
2302355	2306837	I don't know why we trust them with any comments anymore, but whatever.
2306917	2310579	So, okay, so your games are not going to be 1080p.
2310779	2312980	1080i is pretty good anyways.
2314041	2318223	Although, one thing that's kind of being debated right now is load times.
2318363	2323185	And as anyone remembers on the PlayStation stuff, load times can be quite long.
2323735	2335459	And they're actually saying that because of the Blu-ray drive being a first generation drive, it is going to be slower than the actual DVD drive in the Xbox 360.
2336580	2346483	Now, the Blu-ray drive is actually going to be a 1.5 speed drive and transfers at about 54 megabits a second.
2347143	2351065	And they said that their PlayStation 3 is actually a
2352813	2353193	and so on.
2376820	2381162	with a hard drive in mind so you're going to be able to cache a lot of stuff to your hard drive I would think.
2382042	2395468	Whereas the one big thing with the 360 I remember because of the core and premium bundles is they weren't sure if the hard drive was going to be there and so they couldn't really take that into account and cache the information to it.
2396388	2399169	But I guess now more of the games are using the hard drive.
2399349	2400970	But that might be something that might speed it up.
2402430	2403731	Whatever, it's load times.
2404349	2407550	If you want your 1080p games at 120 frames per second, you're going to have to wait.
2409290	2411390	Well, yeah, I think you said it with load times.
2411430	2414351	I mean, I don't care what the speed is of the thing inside the system.
2414391	2419272	It's all about the load time and how good the system is at caching and all that stuff.
2419572	2421012	Though, you know, I get it.
2421092	2424093	Logic dictates that you have a slow drive in the thing, you're going to have longer load times.
2424153	2424473	I get it.
2424533	2429474	But if there's some other way Sony can get around that and the developers, then I don't think it'll be the end of the world.
2430214	2430794	Yeah, exactly.
2430994	2431134	Yeah.
2432168	2437294	All right, well, let's go over to a realm that we don't get into often enough here on this program.
2437334	2440478	That's PC gaming, and we have a few PC gaming stories for you guys tonight.
2440945	2446789	I want to start off with something on Second Life, which is this thing I keep hearing about, but honestly I've never really had a chance to get into and play.
2447110	2448711	Drew Nami, you play Second Life?
2450192	2451853	Tell me a little bit about what Second Life's all about.
2452553	2455055	It's kind of like a virtual community.
2455255	2456256	Actually, it is a virtual community.
2456276	2462721	If you've ever played, say, Sims Online or There or anything like that, it's this virtual world.
2462761	2463761	You have your avatar.
2463802	2465122	You can customize the avatar.
2466003	2467224	It's got a lot of communities in there.
2467244	2469886	It's fairly technical if you want to code your own stuff.
2470114	2471015	Have sex in weird positions.
2471035	2473076	Things that may not be physically possible in real life.
2497462	2499144	Number one, it is possible.
2499444	2502047	Number two, unfortunately, I've seen it done.
2503248	2510495	Or in the case of this picture I'm looking at here, I'm not sure if this is from Second Life or what, but it looks like you have furries banding together there in Second Life.
2510575	2514720	Yeah, there's actually a pretty active furry community within Second Life.
2517006	2522249	I'm not, whatever you're into, I'm not gonna, you know, just, you know, don't touch me with your paws.
2523150	2534337	But anyway, the reason why I bring this up, I got in the news this week that hackers broke into Second Life on Thursday and it was noted on the blog of the parent company to Second Life, Linden Labs.
2534657	2542944	The intruders got access to the account names, real life names, contact information, encrypted account passwords, and encrypted payment information.
2543404	2556816	Now, these types of violations of security sadly aren't that uncommon when you think about it happens in the Amazon type market, but not saying that site specifically, but those type of markets online all the time.
2557316	2560639	But this is really the first, or at least one of the most notable
2561280	2564523	We still get pissed off in MMOs over gold sellers.
2584110	2584330	True.
2584410	2585190	So what do you think about this?
2585210	2589251	Being a Second Life player, what do you think about the fact that your information may have been compromised?
2589411	2599673	Well, for me personally, I don't put anything up on there that I wouldn't be embarrassed to have public, but net result what pissed me off is I had to reset my damn password.
2599713	2601753	They invalidated everyone's passwords.
2602773	2603273	Oh, interesting.
2603873	2606614	Okay, well, at least they were pretty quick to get in there and try to fix things.
2606694	2607074	That's good.
2607854	2609874	Yeah, I think they got it done in like a matter of hours.
2610535	2610955	All right, well.
2611255	2612915	Pretty quick on Linden Labs.
2613260	2617241	Good for them for being right on it and remedying the situation.
2618001	2623163	Well, guess what is not being remedied?
2623763	2624183	What's that?
2624463	2625003	Well, not really.
2625203	2629524	You remember how everyone was all like, yeah, Spore is going to be all over the place, right?
2629944	2632565	Right, like DS and PSP and all that stuff?
2632885	2633045	No.
2634405	2634746	No?
2635106	2636366	Like no console versions at all?
2636946	2638687	It's PC only for now.
2639567	2640047	Oh, okay.
2641565	2654817	Basically, and this is the quote from EA, although we're investigating the possibilities of bringing this franchise to other platforms in the future, any announcements or confirmations for the Wii or any other platform would be premature.
2655538	2664967	Oh, this might be because I think I remember reading another story earlier this week about how I think they were saying something about Spore on the Wii was going to be able to download to the DS and you could edit your creatures on the go.
2665697	2670761	Well, they're saying right now they're 100% focused on finishing Spore for PC and PC only.
2671222	2671562	Okay.
2671762	2673584	As that's the official word.
2674524	2682271	That makes sense, but we all know it's going to go like The Sims, where The Sims was on PC first and then you had five gazillion different versions on all the consoles just later on.
2682331	2682811	It'll spread.
2683052	2683232	Yeah.
2683332	2686394	But for now, I think it's actually good that they are focusing only on PC.
2686815	2692099	That way they can bring out a quality product to get the buzz going and then from their work on the other versions.
2692920	2693020	Hmm.
2693806	2696989	Now OL Army Eddie in our chatroom says, EA lies.
2697569	2697950	Lies.
2698430	2699091	They all lie.
2699551	2699912	Interesting.
2700172	2709480	By the way, also following up on the Second Life information, Tiger Claw in our chat says, also note that the credit card information was on another server and that wasn't compromised.
2710101	2710321	Okay.
2711322	2711682	That's good.
2712383	2716146	Anyways, if you're really into sim stuff, you might be interested in this.
2716166	2717067	Okay.
2717731	2719212	No, this doesn't have to do with the Sims.
2720272	2721873	Some other gaming series.
2722073	2728697	Sid Meier's, they're releasing a wonderful collection, which is going to be coming to stores pretty soon here.
2729337	2739723	It will be including quite a few different games, including Civilization 1, Civ 2, Civ 2 Fantastic Worlds, Civ 2 Conflicts in Civilization,
2740283	2748249	Civ 2, Tests of Time, Civ 3, Civ 3, Play the World, and Civ 3, Conquest, and finally Civ 4.
2749469	2751491	A whole bunch of Civilization for you.
2751751	2754933	But to be honest, if you're a Civilization fan, you probably have all that shit already.
2755133	2773767	I mean, is there anything special that doesn't, you know... Well, you get a Civilization card game, a 96-page book of artwork, and a DVD featuring lead designer Soren Johnson and artist Dorian Newcomb talking about the creation of Civ IV.
2774167	2783671	Now, I really can't bash this too much, because I've said it on this show before, Civilization, the original, the first one that ever came out on the PC, is hands down my favorite PC game ever.
2784171	2784411	Ever.
2784631	2786192	I love the original Civilization.
2786932	2791654	Don't ask me, I can't get into Civ 2, 3, the same, I haven't tried 4 yet, I really want to.
2792034	2794255	I can't get into 2 and 3 the same way I can the original.
2794295	2795216	What were you doing this for?
2795456	2797016	Are you saying I'm too stupid to get 2 and 3?
2797096	2800878	No, I'm saying the entirety of Civ goes right over my head.
2800898	2800938	Oh.
2802355	2806979	Seriously, I don't know if... There's got to be a way you can get Civilization 1 really cheap now.
2807079	2808481	I highly urge you guys to check it out.
2808821	2810322	Civ 2 is not bad either, really.
2810342	2811063	I mean, it's not bad.
2811123	2812364	I just didn't enjoy it as much as 1.
2813025	2814806	So, seriously, check these games out.
2815127	2817729	It's a great, great landmark game in PC history.
2817809	2819070	I absolutely love Civ 1.
2819390	2821092	I used to play Civ Net back in the day.
2821552	2827718	But, you know, I have to admit, actually something like this, to me, who hasn't followed the Civ series for a long time, this almost sounds appealing.
2828542	2828762	DarkSakura
2848733	2850134	I wasn't rolling my eyes.
2850455	2856400	And the queen nerd, DarkSakura, is here to read those emails for you every week.
2856560	2858661	I'm the queen nerd, you're the king dork.
2861484	2867249	So suit up the rubber gloves and asbestos suit and tell us who's emailed us at mailbag at orangenontrader.com this week.
2867729	2871232	I do want to go ahead and actually repeat the ages old disclaimer.
2871732	2873554	If you send us hate mail, all we're going to do is laugh at you.
2874454	2876735	Yeah, so we had a couple ha-ha's this week, which was great.
2876975	2877715	Thank you for the hate mail.
2877915	2879836	It was the most ridiculous thing I've ever read.
2879956	2883317	Anyway, so... Actually, we need more, because I didn't laugh enough this week.
2883378	2884898	So please send us more hate mail, actually.
2885478	2886419	Yeah, Chris, send us hate mail.
2886439	2887799	And hate mail means you were listening.
2888319	2890320	So thank you for downloading our podcast.
2890380	2890900	Seriously.
2892001	2893642	You know what's funny about that hate mail that I read?
2893762	2896783	It's obvious that the people were listening to the show regularly.
2897163	2898203	So, hey, cool.
2898563	2900924	I didn't see the one that was towards you.
2900964	2901665	It doesn't matter.
2901685	2902365	It doesn't matter.
2903760	2909884	Anyway, we got one that is not crap from Renee.
2911165	2911805	I guess it's Renee?
2911946	2912106	Yeah.
2913026	2917109	Hello, Jamie, Skye, and Loki, but mostly Jamie as you're the only one who mostly reads these emails.
2917769	2926875	I was looking through the PEGI Pan-European Game Information website, which is a video game rating board, reported that video games are actually good for you.
2927015	2927675	Here is a link.
2927736	2928836	It's an old article, July 12, 2006.
2930441	2933143	But at least we know that Europe loves video games.
2935444	2939266	It's sort of a long URL, but I'll just go over some highlights.
2940407	2953334	It was about a meeting that was in Brussels on July 6, 2006 that had the consumers, publishers, developers of video games in the European Union involved in this.
2953394	2959217	They were including parent representatives, panels of experts, psychologists, media specialists,
2959815	2963698	who were just discussing the whole thing from what I was reading in this article.
2967761	2969842	There's actually a quote in here that I liked.
2969902	2976627	In light of such a thorough analysis of current issues and such a lively dialogue, we should not let this intellectual stimulation die out.
2977288	2981951	ISFE will see to building upon this exchange and make it happen on a permanent and regular basis.
2982511	2988556	But as they were going through, they were just reviewing the different perceptions based on all sides of the issue
2989396	3000959	and that it was coming through that basically the games have innovative effects on, you know, you can use them for education, treatment of behavior problems, attention deficit disorder.
3001359	3003419	They're even going into manned space exploration.
3004160	3007921	There's all kinds of different applications that video games themselves apply to.
3008001	3014202	I mean, if our army's using them, then there's got to be something there, right?
3014802	3016183	Sorry, you should post that link for the chat room.
3016223	3017483	I bet they'd get a kick out of that article.
3017683	3017903	Oh, I...
3018294	3019894	I accidentally closed it.
3020495	3026896	Where the hell was that kind of information when my parents wouldn't let me get a game system when I was in high school?
3028216	3029357	I'm posting in the chat room right now.
3029797	3030137	Thank you.
3031917	3033018	Videos don't rot your brain.
3033798	3034118	Alright.
3035858	3039079	The television does, and then the aliens suck your face off just like in that episode of Doctor Who.
3039099	3040179	But you play video games on the television.
3042020	3042900	Anyway.
3044940	3045821	Moving on.
3048032	3049314	Wow, this is a long one, too.
3049334	3054020	I guess I'm going to go over this.
3054060	3054581	I'm not sure.
3054601	3056824	Wow, this is a very long email.
3058526	3058847	Sorry.
3059648	3062231	I'm just going to say it's from Kenji.
3062872	3063193	Kenji?
3066017	3069138	To go with this, congratulations on your upcoming 200 episodes.
3069178	3076961	I've been watching OLR since the late 80 episodes, and while I've been unable to watch you guys on a consistent basis... That's amazing seeing we're a radio program.
3076981	3083002	Hey, I applaud your perseverance against the Machina-dominant, big-wig, video game journalist.
3083182	3084923	Praise Yevon Er... I mean, Orange Islands Radio.
3086465	3089106	I have a feeling this is going to be a long email, please brace yourselves.
3089886	3092247	I went into the email box and actually read the email.
3092287	3096628	Was this the one that was about the really in-depth analysis about Sony?
3098789	3099669	I think.
3099729	3101129	I could be crossing my wires here.
3104870	3105951	E3 and Mardi Gras.
3107411	3110312	Oh yeah, there's the Sony Microsoft deal gameplay, yeah.
3111266	3112107	It's long, okay.
3112127	3114469	Okay, I'll go with the gameplay.
3136252	3165442	Since the handheld love, the adoration for everyone's favorite innocently yet so vulgarly named Wii, games with the ability to simply pick up and play, and of all things retro gaming, see the Intellivision Live's console and target, the mock-up 2600s that now store pretty much every good Atari game within its tape deck-like cabinet, the TV games that were on everyone's Christmas wish list a year ago or so,
3166676	3173342	Because there is a growing community that realizes that maybe the forefathers of video gaming had something going, Pong graphically sucked balls.
3174103	3174723	Great description.
3175124	3179248	But it still has the staying power due to its, at the time, imaginative gameplay.
3179588	3180329	Super Mario Bros.
3180389	3187315	was beautiful in the fact that it only took at most two lives for even the most dimwitted of people to get the hang of what you had to do, and the list goes on and on.
3188015	3188837	I'm going to keep going a little bit.
3189378	3198415	In fact, what do the majority of people who game on their PSUs, NES, SNES, Neo Geo, and Genesis emulators nonetheless?
3199517	3200298	That's a good point.
3203328	3212213	Gunpei, who is Mr. Yokoi's magnum opus for the Wonderswan, is now being remade for the current bit generations and touch generations.
3212733	3221398	Our catering to a whole new type of game, our Xbox Live Arcade, is an ingenious Microsoft strategy that I applaud even if I do loathe their very being.
3222082	3223143	Yeah, it's a really long email.
3223163	3228488	And actually, if you don't mind, I would like to actually put this letter up on our forums.
3228628	3228888	All right.
3229048	3237196	So if you're listening, which we hope if you're listening to the podcast right now, just shoot me an email at jamie at orange.radio.com and let me know if you're fine with that.
3237356	3237636	Sweet.
3238216	3242180	You know, just to respond to that about the retro gaming, I think the person's got a good point there.
3242320	3243841	I love Xbox Live Arcade as well.
3243881	3245483	That practically sold the system for me.
3245823	3251453	because the launch titles didn't rock my world but I knew that Arcade was this great thing and there were a couple launch titles I wanted.
3252635	3256041	But I think...
3256875	3261758	Even if a game is old and has basic graphics, it doesn't mean it's going to be a bad game.
3262079	3264760	And I think people do have a lot of respect for the retro graphics.
3265201	3272005	And, you know, of course, a little game called Geometry Wars, I think, woke everybody up to that fact, really, in this next-gen battle.
3272065	3277749	So I think you are going to see the retro factor really start to kind of crank up a little bit in this next-gen.
3279350	3285975	There's actually a very good comparison to one of Tezuka's comics.
3287335	3289096	and I guess the current industry.
3289356	3290916	I really want to put this up on the site.
3290956	3293437	It's very long and I'm not going to do it justice reading it over the air.
3293917	3296677	So I'd really like permission to post it up on the site.
3296717	3297338	Just let me know, please.
3297618	3297878	All right.
3298138	3298658	Any more emails?
3299158	3299558	Oh, yeah.
3299718	3299978	All right.
3301219	3302739	No, I have no more email.
3304739	3305640	One week you weren't here.
3305660	3306560	I went to the mailbag.
3306600	3307480	It was like nothing there.
3307500	3308740	I was like, wow.
3308760	3309581	Jamie was gone.
3309601	3311421	Okay, no need to email.
3311541	3312441	Hey, watch that ego.
3312701	3314282	Hey, my email is great.
3314922	3315082	Okay.
3316488	3320071	Okay, this is from, I guess, Stickaxe?
3320271	3322633	I don't have a signature on here, so I'm just... Oh, Eric, sorry.
3323714	3327438	You guys are absolutely the greatest audio-only entertainment out there, no questions asked.
3327498	3329680	My name is Eric, and I write to you from Indiana.
3330180	3338407	Loki, you are amazing, awesome, superior, great, mighty, sweet, strong, marvelous, almighty, godlike, admirable, excellent, satisfying, pleasing, respectable, gnarly, stupendous, and honorable.
3340489	3341250	Who was that?
3342590	3343831	What?
3344331	3346111	Who was that that they were talking about?
3346412	3348492	They were talking about Loki.
3348792	3349833	Oh, is this the one?
3350193	3351934	Yeah, that was the one I mentioned.
3351974	3352994	No, I know, it's funny.
3354014	3355995	Jamie, you are just absolutely amazing.
3356255	3356875	Oh, thank you.
3357035	3360116	Skye, I'm sorry, man, but you honestly have to try and shut up for more than 10 seconds at a time.
3362877	3366039	As he drinks his ginger beer.
3366519	3367019	Not talking.
3368484	3371365	Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
3371605	3372105	Nope, sorry.
3372505	3372906	Can't talk.
3373066	3374066	Listeners don't like me talking.
3374646	3375386	I talk too damn much.
3376847	3377527	I like you talking.
3379188	3380548	Nope, I make this show too gay.
3380568	3381289	I can't talk anymore.
3382129	3388331	This Rob is... Our show is... This Rob is gay.
3388471	3390312	This Rob is very gay.
3391312	3392833	What is wrong with this Rob?
3392893	3393873	He's so gay.
3393913	3395273	He gays up orange line radio.
3395293	3396474	Rob is our facilitator.
3397290	3398491	Rob is our facilitator.
3398531	3400151	Maybe I do talk too much.
3401852	3406995	Keep in mind, kids, what I do for a living, I talk all day to people and they are paid to listen to me.
3407035	3408596	I'm a trainer, basically.
3409076	3410117	I can't shut up.
3410157	3410717	It's my nature.
3410757	3411157	I'm sorry.
3412178	3412798	Hugs and kisses.
3413934	3417077	With all of that out of the way, I was seriously wondering something.
3418798	3420760	The one I got was crap.
3422001	3424443	Probably mentioned it on one of your earlier shows, so I apologize.
3424823	3427045	I'm a big fanboy of the show Stargate SG-1.
3427105	3427626	Oh, I love you.
3428166	3432750	And last year I heard there was going to be a Stargate SG-1 video game coming out later that year.
3433170	3436333	I was really excited about it at first and sort of forgot about it as time went on.
3436733	3437294	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3452948	3456009	I know the answer to the guy's question but I can't talk.
3475129	3475909	It was canceled.
3476329	3477170	They did cancel it.
3477710	3481911	If you want, however, I did take pictures of their area.
3482091	3483371	I took pictures of the game.
3484732	3485732	I can get all that up.
3486012	3488993	Actually, our gallery from that E3 should still be up.
3489393	3489753	I think it is.
3490393	3492054	So a lot of my pictures are there.
3492194	3495855	You can check them out in our picture gallery on OrangeOwlRadio.com.
3495895	3496395	Who remembers?
3496455	3497395	Why did they cancel that?
3497435	3501557	Because Stargate really does have a nerd-tastic following to it, and that's not a bad thing.
3501597	3501937	It's a good show.
3501957	3502317	It's pretty good.
3503878	3508081	It's a first-person shooter, and I think it was really great.
3508121	3512183	I wish they had kept going with it, because I would have bought that day one.
3512724	3514505	Solarwing in the chatroom read my mind.
3514605	3518468	Battlestar Galactica, the video game, that's just a matter of time, yes?
3519308	3519689	One would hope.
3519749	3523031	I want a Doctor Who video game, because I'm into my Doctor Who fandom.
3523792	3526113	But as for the very end, I'm also becoming a bit confused.
3526133	3530416	Would it be possible for you guys to list every gaming console you've ever owned in your long lifespan, please?
3530957	3532518	We do not have a show long enough...
3533931	3535432	Because I still currently own them.
3537573	3540634	Unless you've got time for me to list off about 40-something video game systems.
3540874	3541214	Sorry.
3542675	3543355	I'm a virtual boy.
3543815	3550458	You know, I was just thinking, if they made video games out of TV shows I watch, video game industry would die.
3550478	3551739	Big Brother the game.
3551779	3552819	Big Brother the video game.
3555034	3557136	For anyone that reads my live journal, I never talk about games.
3557176	3558677	I just talk about the TV show Big Brother.
3559938	3561620	Can you imagine Big Brother the video game?
3561780	3567305	Three people in my car, me who does not watch TV, I just buy box sets, talking about Big Brother.
3569547	3571128	Press the A button to continue.
3571549	3573871	But first, a live eviction... Never mind.
3574753	3575773	DMN hates me, there it is in chat.
3575793	3575914	What?
3575934	3576294	DMN, you bastard.
3576314	3578335	He doesn't really hate me.
3578355	3578655	And look.
3601727	3603869	SolarWing says Big Brother could be an MMO.
3604089	3605730	VidPower admits to watching Big Brother.
3606110	3612275	I know we have UK listeners, and I know it's a completely different show here than it is over there, but I know it's crazy over there.
3612696	3613336	Anyway, sorry.
3613696	3614117	Video games.
3614297	3614457	Yes.
3614537	3614837	Okay.
3615518	3617739	This one comes from Distinct.
3618820	3619261	Hey, all.
3619881	3623924	The store I run sells games, and we've got release dates for Wii games coming November 1st.
3624505	3628648	I know these usually change a lot, but I think if Nintendo was going to do an October launch, then the games...
3629908	3631249	would be listed for October.
3631730	3640456	So it looks like to me the Wii is going to drop a week or two before the PS3, which we have dates for games as well, and they're all around the same time as the PS3 launch.
3640917	3642378	Here are some release dates for other titles.
3642398	3647562	Loki probably is on top of this already, but in case something's different from what you've heard, Lost Planet, Xbox 360, January 31st.
3650882	3660907	Soprano Xbox 360 November 14th, Darkness Xbox 360 March 31st, Superman Xbox 360 December 1st, and Rainbow Six Vegas on Xbox 360 November 15th.
3661547	3664088	And a lot of other titles dropping the same time as PS3 launch.
3664228	3670271	Oddly enough, we have no confirmed date for Gears of War, which has actually had a date announced to the press.
3672692	3673333	Anyway, great show.
3673353	3676114	I thought I'd try and give some info, but like I said, you probably know this already.
3677219	3678140	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3701360	3702201	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3718484	3719766	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3733584	3734825	I think I might want to pick up that game.
3735345	3736206	I really might.
3736266	3740109	It's not as awful as the one that was on the Nintendo 64.
3740289	3740649	Oh, yeah.
3740689	3741290	No, no, no.
3741410	3742791	At E3, it was awesome.
3742811	3744672	Imagine Grand Theft Auto, but you're Superman.
3745153	3746354	Hey, I'd be all over that.
3746414	3749316	It'll be as badass as Superman on the Atari 2600 was.
3750837	3751677	Or maybe, what was it?
3752318	3755360	Death and Return of Superman, one of the few beat-em-ups Blizzard ever made.
3756921	3757121	Okay.
3757242	3761445	Well, anyways, while we're on the subject here, I thought I would, you know, clear up a few things.
3761825	3761885	Um,
3762697	3767019	Let's see, as far as release dates go, I think that was about right.
3767039	3774703	Remember, I know Lost Planet is coming out in January because they were saying that no other games are coming out in January and you'll pretty much own January.
3776244	3783527	Now, I know there have been a lot of... I'm sure that you saw this too in our wonderful Under the Radar thread that we have in our forums.
3784127	3787249	There have been a lot of the stories that we've been talking about have appeared...
3788766	3789166	and so on.
3815299	3819941	I know he doesn't listen to the show very much, but Bad Bobby, no cookie for you.
3821401	3825042	Well, to go ahead and gear this back towards the email.
3825162	3828783	You've got a story coming up that addresses something we brought up last week.
3829063	3830584	You're trying to make a preemptive strike here.
3830624	3831744	Let her finish the damn email.
3832284	3835105	Warrior Bob writes in and says, Hey there, OLR crew.
3835185	3839067	It's been like a year or something since I've written in, but you're still awesome and I'm still listening.
3839147	3840047	Thanks for all the great podcasts.
3840527	3841507	for all the great podcasts.
3842067	3842927	Comments for each of you.
3843187	3851149	Sky, I was just listening to your last podcast and you were asking about disconnects in Street Fighter 2 HF on Xbox Live.
3851609	3855250	I can assure you that a disconnect counts as a win for the person who didn't disconnect.
3855850	3858610	I got my achievement for 20 wins online when the other guy timed out.
3859670	3859930	Hot.
3860070	3860550	Okay, good.
3860570	3861611	Good to know.
3861651	3861951	Thank you.
3862271	3869092	Loki, a friend of mine runs a college radio show about video games at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and called me on
3869929	3870949	Frequently as a co-host.
3871030	3873751	Like any person, I've got influence in how I approach something.
3874151	3884055	After a few months of broadcasting, I realized that even if I don't agree with you all the time, even most of the time, your style on air is basically my biggest influence and I wanted to write and say so so that you can have the ego boost you rightfully deserve.
3885636	3888857	That was the equivalent of a man hug, I think.
3888938	3889898	That was very nice.
3890378	3892999	One to me, Byright is a false icon.
3893179	3893480	Yes!
3894340	3895640	Damn them to hell!
3897361	3898422	Wow, my ears are ringing.
3898542	3898762	Sorry.
3899249	3900130	I'll hold the microphone away.
3900150	3900872	Alright, I know.
3901192	3902494	Didn't help me in studio.
3904637	3907722	You guys all rule and I look forward to this week's show just like I do every week.
3907802	3908183	Take care.
3908804	3909725	Oh, that's so nice.
3909745	3910046	Thank you.
3910066	3911348	Oh, I love the ego boost email.
3912089	3914112	Maybe we should run down to Cal Poly and do a show.
3914730	3915270	I think so.
3916311	3921435	Was that the same person that wanted us to go there to do some type of panel thingy?
3921715	3922495	That was about a year ago.
3922515	3923536	We couldn't make it at that time.
3923576	3924977	It didn't work out, unfortunately.
3925638	3927159	We need to go on the road.
3927359	3927719	We do.
3927759	3929881	We need to go on a college tour across America.
3930701	3934084	Make sure that you have kegs with good beer.
3934104	3935004	Just bring Guinness kegs.
3935104	3936365	Bring Guinness, bring bass.
3936385	3937526	Drunami will be our roadie.
3937786	3938567	Bring me some fat tire.
3938587	3939647	Chris can be our tour manager.
3939667	3942670	Sure.
3942790	3943030	Sure.
3943700	3944381	I'm old, I go to bed early.
3944421	3945121	I like pillow fights.
3962728	3965709	Hey OLR, this is from DMN, oh my god.
3966589	3970049	Hi DMN, and this is the one that I said I would read.
3970690	3976011	I was wondering what your opinion on Guitar Hero 2 retailing for $49.99, this being for the game only.
3976511	3986132	Do you guys think that with this being the first music game being priced for over $40, that the sales of this game will be hampered, or will this encourage the sale of the bundle to people who already own the game?
3986773	3988333	Also, your thoughts on Dance Factory.
3988513	3988753	Thanks.
3990029	3990569	DDR in the groove even.
3990589	3991190	I can't imagine...
4019204	4023385	As far as Guitar Hero 2 going for $49.99, I do think that's a bit excessive for price.
4024105	4035429	I think that for those of us who already have it, the game should retail around, I'd say, between $30 and $40 and make a really good deal for the guitar bundle.
4035909	4038029	It's like $60 for the guitar bundle or something like that.
4038209	4039350	That's how I think it should be.
4039370	4042731	$50 for the game only is excessive, I believe.
4042751	4044391	All right.
4046281	4050824	I was gonna say something last week and I took mercy on you, but dear god in heaven, why? !
4075396	4077496	Rob is back on Final Fantasy XI!
4077756	4078697	You traitor!
4080337	4082317	You are a traitor and a liar.
4083337	4084658	And you need to be spanked.
4086538	4087418	Chris, spank him for me.
4089559	4090419	A little harder, please.
4090459	4093499	You, Mr. F, quit World of Warcraft.
4093559	4095100	I did not quit World of Warcraft.
4095200	4097100	My account is still active.
4097120	4098740	You sit down and drink your goddamn tea.
4103602	4116508	Orange Lounge Radio is quite possibly the only video game podcast on the entire internet that has lesbians spanking gay men over MMOs.
4117349	4121391	And to correct myself, it's sit your ass down on that chair and drink your goddamn tea.
4123331	4124792	Lesbians are always relevant.
4127657	4132782	DJ Janai wants me to hit him with the yaoi paddle stick.
4149977	4150677	I need to make one.
4150877	4152538	We need to make... Okay.
4152998	4155079	What's this, we're going to YowieCon?
4155119	4156880	I heard that coming out of your mouth there.
4157120	4164223	I heard this, we're going to... No, we as in me and Chris and Megzie and another one of our friends is going to YowieCon this year.
4164864	4166625	So we need to make Yowie Behave paddles.
4166845	4169426	Alright, look, we gotta wrap this up because we still have DDR...
4170802	4172683	We saw the DDR previews of this segment.
4172983	4175525	And whoever that little rat informant is in chat, I'm going to find you.
4175545	4176206	I'm going to get you.
4176366	4177887	I know it's DMN.
4178007	4178727	I know it's him.
4179067	4179988	No, it's not DMN.
4180048	4180308	All right.
4181289	4182290	I'm going to own DMN anyway.
4182310	4183230	I'm going to figure out who you are.
4183250	4183851	I'm going to beat you up.
4183891	4184171	All right.
4185131	4185652	Send us an email.
4185672	4186012	It's Ranchan.
4186412	4188113	Mailbag at Orange Lounge Radio.
4188173	4189014	Sorry, Ranchan.
4189074	4190175	I love you.
4190435	4191576	I'm coming to New York, too.
4193417	4195338	And I'm bringing my Yowie paddle.
4195378	4197479	By the way... DMN says, fuck you, Rob.
4197519	4197700	Check...
4201263	4202784	You name the time and the place, I'll be there.
4202844	4203224	No pants.
4203804	4207266	Tape it!
4207346	4208747	It's only porn if you get it on tape.
4208767	4211908	I am turning this car around and we are going back to On Topic Road.
4212249	4212729	Right now.
4217830	4226954	Check the Orange Launch Radio forums because Sky is coming to New York City in October and we'll be doing a meetup, I think, at the Nintendo Store, possibly somewhere else.
4226974	4227514	I'm not sure yet.
4228014	4236358	But check the forums for more information if you're in New York City because I want to meet some fans and maybe tape a live segment or something to let our East Coasters have a part on the show.
4236938	4237198	All right.
4238206	4238726	Back to games.
4239027	4247633	Super Paper Mario, a game I'm very, very much looking forward to that was going to be coming out for the GameCube, is now not going to be coming out for the GameCube.
4247653	4247933	Rumored.
4248874	4250995	Well, it's a rumor, but this seems like a pretty good one to me.
4251136	4253357	Rumored until Thursday when they announce it officially.
4253417	4257400	I don't understand why they would continue to build all these GameCube games.
4258121	4259962	Well, I mean, I guess the Wii can play them.
4260242	4260462	Yeah.
4260903	4261583	You know what I think?
4261763	4263745	Okay, so Super Paper Mario, obviously, is going to be...
4264246	4264866	Coming out for the Wii.
4264906	4269708	This is coming off some IGN dude's blog that says, Hmm, how should I write this?
4270228	4271088	Have to be vague, you know?
4271188	4275149	Let me just say that, yes, Paper Mario will be headed to Wii and not GameCube.
4275510	4277050	Now, read between the lines, damn you.
4277130	4278591	Wait, that was a terrible hint.
4278951	4279851	Alright, that's it for today.
4279911	4280691	Time to beat Bozone.
4281151	4287633	And that was coming from Matt Casamassina from IGN, who apparently gets more insider knowledge than we do.
4287673	4288033	Whatever.
4289234	4292755	Look, I would bet anything maybe it's one of those games where
4293203	4298685	There's more features on the Wii than there are on the GameCube.
4299505	4306587	Not like Zelda where there's two separate versions, but I think about those games like the Zelda games that were on the Color Game Boy.
4306627	4308827	When you put them in the Advance, you got the Advance Store.
4309027	4309808	Like, what was it?
4309908	4312188	Oracle of Ages, Seasons, whatever that was.
4312589	4314409	You had extra stuff if you played it in the Advance.
4314489	4317530	That would seem logical to me and a very Nintendo thing to do.
4317570	4320531	That's pretty interesting that Matt Casamena...
4321701	4323042	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4348174	4361859	Okay, to this credit though, I'm actually going to give the doubt, you know, if they went to Ubisoft and talked about it directly, they probably didn't get it from the show, but doesn't that validate what you were saying last week, at least part of it?
4361999	4365901	What I'm saying, I don't say that, you know, it's not legit and they...
4366243	4366563	DarkSakura.com
4393971	4396492	For example, other things that kind of go along with that.
4396992	4403575	One up ran a story this week talking about the PS2 Slim coming out in a silver color, as reported on episode 196.
4405716	4412538	Kotaku reported on a brand new PSP Entertainment bundle that's going to be coming out, as we reported on episode 196.
4412879	4417820	This story, of course, we talked about, came out last week, we talked about that.
4419722	4426465	IGN also ran a story about the grim adventures of Billy and Mandy coming out for the Wii as reported on episode 195.
4427625	4432267	And then, yeah, so it's not a big surprise here.
4432427	4432768	You know what?
4432828	4439590	Our t-shirts should have that big, should have that picture of the alien spaceship that you see on it.
4439650	4442231	And it says, I believe, and then in parentheses, OLR.
4444412	4445633	That could be our shirts.
4447887	4449487	I want to believe, OLR
4477759	4478800	We're just giving Bobby a hard time.
4479020	4480741	I know, we love Bobby.
4480761	4485805	Bobby's awesome, but I always have to give him... Allgames.com, Sunday nights, 5 o'clock, Bobby Blackwolf Show.
4485845	4486525	It's rad.
4488006	4488907	So, alright.
4491829	4492770	Are we ready for the next story?
4493590	4494231	Next story?
4495051	4495492	I don't know.
4495552	4496913	I think I'm going to, like, boycott.
4497713	4498013	Why?
4498554	4499815	Because I don't like this game.
4500255	4501596	Well, read it anyway.
4501616	4502076	No, I know.
4502096	4502136	Um...
4503840	4513245	Anyway, there is going to be a progressive scan in 16 to 9 widescreen mode for Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam.
4514886	4515986	On what system, does it say?
4516727	4517587	Well, it's only for the Wii.
4517827	4518308	Oh, the Wii?
4519229	4526716	That's, you know what, that's neat, that's great, but not too surprising because when we saw Elebits at the Konami thing, it was running widescreen.
4526736	4532020	Yeah, and it was supposed to be, I think they were supposed to be doing 480p and widescreen on the games anyways.
4532060	4534903	Weren't all the games we saw at E3 on widescreen?
4534923	4535883	I think so, so.
4536064	4536644	It's kind of weird.
4537024	4542749	I mean, not to belittle your story, but I'm just saying, you know, because somebody else picked up that story, I'm just kind of like, well, weren't they all kind of showing in widescreen anyway?
4543110	4543390	I don't know.
4544281	4548502	Maybe because people are ragging on the graphics of the Wii, saying it's not going to be as good as the other systems.
4548522	4549442	I think it looks fine.
4549482	4551782	Here's something to show that, hey, at least they still support widescreen.
4551902	4552522	It's a little something.
4552862	4553003	Yep.
4553423	4558423	And also, they showed the first screenshots of GT on IGN, and it actually looks pretty cool.
4558443	4563544	It's all cel-shaded, so it kind of reminds me a little bit of, like, Crazy Taxi, but a racing game.
4564124	4565105	So, I don't know.
4565125	4565805	I like it.
4566665	4566905	All right.
4567145	4567345	Cool.
4568265	4572706	I just want to point out as well, I saw part of the reason that Final Fantasy XII has taken an
4573459	4573679	and so on.
4600151	4600771	DarkSakura
4620063	4646768	Excitebike, F-Zero, Kid Icarus, The Legend of Zelda, The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, Mario Kart 64, The Original Metroid, Mortal Kombat, New Adventure Island, Ninja Gaiden, Outrun, Pac-Man, Prince of Persia, I imagine the original, Punch-Out, R-Type, Rayman 2, Sonic the Hedgehog, Star Fox, Super Mario 64, Super Mario Brothers, Super Mario Kart, Super Mario World, and Tecmo Bowl.
4647048	4648969	R-Type, R-Type, R-Type, R-Type
4677935	4681077	Where some of the more Genesis games are.
4681117	4683318	They'll probably just slowly roll out, don't you think?
4683878	4684959	I don't know.
4685099	4686420	I'm kind of a wait and see.
4686460	4687781	I want to see how this thing's going to look.
4688241	4695345	To be honest, Virtual Console is awesome and stuff, but it's not why I'm buying the system.
4696185	4700588	Well, now we're going to get into a part of the show that I think a lot of you guys have been waiting for.
4701323	4701683	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
4724338	4726800	Some folks criticized it for how diverse it was.
4727561	4728401	But it's going to be interesting.
4728441	4732765	I think you're going to find that Ultramix 4, the song list was previously announced and posted to our website.
4733365	4733906	There's a lot of...
4734983	4735103	XBOX 360
4763086	4763286	D.D.R.
4763366	4763807	Universe, D.D.R.
4763827	4764147	Ultramix 4
4793027	4795648	And that's pretty much going to be the same rhythm we're going to do throughout the promotion.
4795668	4797549	It's two songs from each game each week.
4798010	4800531	And I guess we should just get it started, shouldn't we?
4800851	4801011	Yes.
4801131	4802572	So here's tonight's first song.
4802732	4805493	Tonight's first song is from DDR Universe.
4805873	4810116	And this first one is going to be a long version because we have some long versions sprinkled out throughout the promotion.
4810496	4814418	This is a brand new original song and it's by an artist called Drew Campbell.
4814818	4815898	And the song is called 8-Bit.
4817279	4822562	And I think what you're going to dig about this song is that the title describes the sound of the song.
4822982	4825404	So I think you guys are going to really dig this track.
4825464	4833348	So here it is to kick off our series of DDR sneak peeks here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4833368	4837291	This is Drew Campbell with 8-Bit from DDR Universe, the long version.
4851934	4852616	Thanks for watching!
5013888	5014569	Thanks for watching!
5057665	5064467	Coming soon to DDR Universe, that was Drew Campbell with 8-Bit here on Orange Lounge Radio, the DDR Sneak Previews.
5064847	5068468	And speaking of 8-Bit, we've been running a contest here on the program recently.
5068989	5074830	It's called Beat the Host, and it had to do with guessing the songs that we were playing from 8-Bit video games of the past.
5075130	5077751	And we have one of the winners on the line with us tonight.
5077871	5079612	Say hello to DMN, everybody.
5079672	5080332	How you doing, DMN?
5081448	5083749	You're going to be listening to Edge of Control by John D. and Spesh.
5151954	5152655	Outro Music
5192325	5194846	DDR Sneak Peeks
5215137	5218038	It's a remix of a song from the Echoing Green.
5218438	5220939	So this is coming to us, I believe, from the A Different Drum license.
5221279	5223100	And it's remixed by Echo Image.
5223540	5225641	So here it is from DDR Universe.
5226141	5230103	This is Echoing Green, remixed by Echo Image.
5230203	5233164	Heart with a View, here on Orange Lounge Radio, TDR Sneak Peek.
5259108	5263870	Look into the sky, feel the wind blow Look into my eyes, there's a window
5327378	5331061	Echoing Green, remixed by Echo Image here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5331101	5334624	That is Heart with a View coming up to DDR Universe.
5335164	5336886	Alright, one more song for the previews tonight.
5336926	5339868	This is another song coming to you on DDR Ultramix 4.
5340549	5342310	It's by a group called Funk Police.
5342951	5345473	This is The Problem here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5363574	5364836	Thank you for watching!
5398915	5400197	Thank you for watching!
5441138	5448481	All right, that was The Problem here on Orange Lounge Radio by Funk Police, and that's going to bring to a close our first wave of DDR sneak peeks.
5448521	5456345	So to recap, tonight we had from Dance Dance Revolution Universe, we had Drew Campbell with 8-Bit, and then Echoing Green remixed by Echo Image.
5456505	5458166	Heart with a View is the name of that song.
5458506	5465889	And then from DDR Ultramix 4, we had The Problem by Funk Police, and before that we heard Edge of Control by Joni and Spesh.
5466449	5467510	What happened to Loki's mic?
5467530	5467810	It's somewhere.
5467830	5467990	I ate it.
5496483	5497444	Use this one in the meantime.
5499305	5500667	Somebody stole my microphone.
5501047	5501547	Oh, there it is.
5501828	5503469	It was by the donuts, you dumbass.
5505030	5505971	Damn, those donuts.
5505991	5508113	I think that the microphone snuck off to have some donuts.
5508133	5508453	It was okay.
5508653	5509033	I like them.
5509994	5510335	All right.
5510915	5511475	Good deal.
5511516	5513597	We'll have more for you guys here next week on Orange Lounge Radio.
5514078	5517921	And that, I believe, is going to bring to a close Part A of our podcast.
5517981	5522525	It's been quite a long half thanks to those previews, so we're going to take a quick break.
5523205	5523786	We'll be back.
5525027	5526549	Don't get started again, lady.
5526569	5530292	We'll be back a little later on with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
