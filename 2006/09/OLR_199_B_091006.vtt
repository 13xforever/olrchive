00:15.480 --> 00:20.120
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:20.120 --> 00:26.320
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 199 for this September the 10th of

00:26.320 --> 00:27.320
2006.

00:27.320 --> 00:30.080
And yes, I know people have been asking, what are you guys going to do for episode number

00:30.080 --> 00:31.080
200?

00:31.080 --> 00:32.800
And the answer is, we're not quite sure yet.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.160
We're just going to do our thing and see what happens.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.260
But it'll be a fun show next week, nevertheless.

00:37.260 --> 00:42.040
So we hope you'll be back to join us live Sunday, September 17th, 2006 for episode 200.

00:42.040 --> 00:43.760
And if you can't join us live, there's always a podcast.

00:43.760 --> 00:45.000
I know what we'll be talking about.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
What's that?

00:46.000 --> 00:49.120
We'll be talking about the Wii, because the official announcement's going to be happening,

00:49.120 --> 00:50.120
what, this Thursday?

00:50.120 --> 00:53.480
I bet Nintendo planned it that way.

00:53.480 --> 00:54.640
They knew.

00:54.640 --> 00:55.960
They did it just for us.

00:55.960 --> 00:59.440
It's for you, O.L.R.

00:59.440 --> 01:07.080
I want Reggie to come out on stage with his 40 and go, this one's for O.L.R., my bitches.

01:07.080 --> 01:10.000
I am nobody's bitch.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.320
I will, however, whore myself out for, no.

01:12.320 --> 01:15.160
Yeah, but who needs a Nintendo press conference to have Wii News?

01:15.160 --> 01:16.160
Exactly.

01:16.160 --> 01:17.340
You don't need Wii News.

01:17.340 --> 01:22.800
You can do what some sites did and tell people, hey, guess what, we got big freaking news

01:22.800 --> 01:26.280
coming at 12 o'clock in the morning.

01:26.280 --> 01:30.920
And then you find out, guess what, it's something that we pretty much already knew, that the

01:30.920 --> 01:36.240
Wii chips were well under production, but IBM came out and confirmed that, that it's

01:36.240 --> 01:39.600
been in production since the beginning of this quarter.

01:39.600 --> 01:45.360
And for those of you who are not savvy in the calendar, that means July.

01:45.360 --> 01:51.400
And so that the actual first shipments of the chips are in Nintendo's hands and that

01:51.400 --> 01:54.240
the Wii is well underway for launch.

01:54.240 --> 01:57.920
Whenever that is, of course, we'll know that in a few days.

01:57.920 --> 01:59.000
November though, right?

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
We know that for sure.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.280
Well, yeah, it's November, but you know, I'm still not, you never know, they could just

02:05.280 --> 02:12.160
come and say, you've been punked, it's fucking, it's coming out tomorrow, as long as we're

02:12.160 --> 02:14.600
not juiced, I'm okay with that.

02:14.600 --> 02:20.240
So all right, it's fine.

02:20.240 --> 02:24.640
To the site's credit, you know, I know the hype machine got way out of control, but they

02:24.640 --> 02:27.640
didn't know that people were going to run it on dig and all this crazy stuff.

02:27.640 --> 02:29.800
I mean, people went wild with this.

02:29.800 --> 02:33.720
There's going to be news soon, you know, heck, we already told you guys the Wii is coming

02:33.720 --> 02:34.720
out soon.

02:34.720 --> 02:35.720
Exactly.

02:35.720 --> 02:40.620
Anyway, all right, well, definitely one thing that will be coming to the Wii that is a little

02:40.620 --> 02:44.960
bit of a surprise, not usually the type of game you think about when you think about

02:44.960 --> 02:50.200
Nintendo, at least I don't, but Splinter Cell Double Agent does appear that it's going to

02:50.200 --> 02:53.640
be a launch title, at least that's what IGN reported earlier this week.

02:53.640 --> 02:58.280
The Wii version, Splinter Cell Double Agent, was based on the PlayStation 2 and GameCube

02:58.280 --> 03:03.280
builds, and it will fully utilize the unique control system that the Wii has.

03:03.280 --> 03:07.040
Of course, nothing specific has been given on the control system yet, but I'm sure we

03:07.040 --> 03:11.440
will know more as time moves on.

03:11.440 --> 03:14.880
Examples that have been giving us possible ideas that the Wiimote could be used to like

03:14.880 --> 03:17.520
pick locks, you know, cute little things like that.

03:17.520 --> 03:20.440
So that should be fun for those of you guys that are into the Splinter Cell series.

03:20.440 --> 03:21.440
Toss them in.

03:21.440 --> 03:26.320
If you do have a Wii and you just don't want that, you know, finicky controls and stuff

03:26.320 --> 03:29.280
from the Wii version, you can just get the GameCube version.

03:29.280 --> 03:30.520
Sounds good to me.

03:30.520 --> 03:38.400
Well, speaking of things that are coming out that sounded wrong, how about our UK release

03:38.400 --> 03:39.400
date?

03:39.400 --> 03:41.120
I have an announcement, never mind.

03:41.120 --> 03:43.400
I have an announcement to make.

03:43.400 --> 03:45.960
You are a horror.

03:45.960 --> 03:46.960
What?

03:46.960 --> 03:51.920
I am really fond of burritos.

03:51.920 --> 03:53.400
You're burrito-sexual, huh?

03:53.400 --> 03:54.400
I'm burrito-sexual.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.400
That's hot.

03:55.400 --> 03:56.400
All right.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.400
No, really.

03:57.400 --> 03:58.400
I, uh, no.

03:58.400 --> 03:59.400
Maybe one day.

03:59.400 --> 04:00.400
Anyway, release dates.

04:00.400 --> 04:01.400
How about that?

04:01.400 --> 04:10.760
On the 11th in the UK, we have Lego Star Wars II, the opening, the original trilogy coming

04:10.760 --> 04:12.880
up for everything.

04:12.880 --> 04:14.080
And I'm not kidding.

04:14.080 --> 04:15.840
It's coming up for everything, except for PC.

04:15.840 --> 04:16.840
No, even PC.

04:16.840 --> 04:19.560
It's coming up for everything.

04:19.560 --> 04:22.280
And then, um, that's it.

04:22.280 --> 04:24.480
I'm serious.

04:24.480 --> 04:27.560
I'm looking at that and it's all the 11th.

04:27.560 --> 04:28.880
I hope you're a Star Wars fan.

04:28.880 --> 04:29.880
Okay, I'm kidding.

04:29.880 --> 04:32.300
There's actually a bunch of stuff on the 15th, too.

04:32.300 --> 04:37.300
We have 50 Cent Bulletproof on PSP, Ace Combat Zero, The Belkan War, Broken Sword, The Angel

05:02.060 --> 05:08.400
Bike Racing Challenge, Tekken Dark Resurrection, which I have and it's freaking rad, and Yakuza

05:08.400 --> 05:11.200
on the 16,000 getting Suikoden V.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.200
Hmm, sweet.

05:12.200 --> 05:14.180
That's a pretty good line up there.

05:14.180 --> 05:18.440
I just want to share this real quick from chat, SSJ100Matt says, the Wii rumors are

05:18.440 --> 05:20.240
like the U.S. terror threat.

05:20.240 --> 05:22.720
We don't know when it will happen, but it will happen soon.

05:22.720 --> 05:25.280
That's a good analogy.

05:25.280 --> 05:29.800
If you want to join our chat room and get funny little gems like that, it's orangeontrated.com.

05:29.800 --> 05:30.800
Click on chat.

05:30.800 --> 05:31.800
Bravo to you.

05:31.800 --> 05:34.320
Anywho, the U.S. is getting quite a slate of games.

05:34.320 --> 05:39.060
Of course, they are also getting Lego Star Wars 2, the original trilogy.

05:39.060 --> 05:47.960
Some stuff also coming out, we've got of course, The Good Bummer Man on PSP, Mario Hoops 3

05:47.960 --> 05:56.240
on 1 for the DS, Cookie Mama also for the DS, Godfather on the 360 and then Godfather

05:56.240 --> 06:03.400
Mob Wars on the PSP, King of Fighters 2006 is coming out on Playstation 2, Mega Man ZX

06:03.400 --> 06:05.400
on the DS.

06:05.400 --> 06:12.360
If you're a hockey fan, NHL 07 coming out on Playstation 2, Xbox, the 360 and PSP and

06:12.360 --> 06:18.920
also NHL 2K7 coming out on Playstation 2, Xbox and 360.

06:18.920 --> 06:23.800
We've got Rengoku 2 coming out on the PSP, crap.

06:23.800 --> 06:28.860
And One Piece Pirates Carnival on the Playstation 2 and GameCube.

06:28.860 --> 06:33.140
And of course, the game we were talking about earlier, Rule of Rose will be making its way

06:33.140 --> 06:36.400
on to Playstation 2.

06:36.400 --> 06:42.280
And if you have a Game Boy Advance and are looking for something to play, how about Super

06:42.280 --> 06:49.360
Robot Tyson, the original generation for Game Boy Advance.

06:49.360 --> 06:54.360
By popular demand, we are going to add a new segment to this release date bonanza because

06:54.360 --> 06:58.220
I'm feeling left out because I usually don't have release dates to report on.

06:58.220 --> 07:01.360
So we're going to add Japanese release dates now.

07:01.360 --> 07:07.320
So here you go, coming out September 12th in Japan, Metal Slug 6 and Minna no Tennis,

07:07.320 --> 07:08.880
which is everybody's tennis.

07:08.880 --> 07:12.080
Coming out September 14th, which is the much bigger release day over there in Japan, you

07:12.080 --> 07:15.320
have Cluster Edge coming out from Marvelous Entertainment.

07:15.320 --> 07:16.320
You have G.I.

07:16.320 --> 07:22.960
Jockey 3 and 4 by Koe, everybody's tennis also coming out there for the Sony.

07:22.960 --> 07:31.600
And let's see, we have Simple 2000 series volume 106, 107, and 108, Winning Post 6 coming

07:31.600 --> 07:37.440
out also from Koe, and Neon Genesis Evangelion.

07:37.440 --> 07:38.680
I said it, didn't I?

07:38.680 --> 07:39.680
Yes, you did.

07:39.680 --> 07:42.360
Kotsetsu no Girlfriend Special Edition.

07:42.360 --> 07:45.400
Another Eva dating sim, what the hell?

07:45.400 --> 07:47.560
That's coming out September 15th.

07:47.560 --> 07:48.640
No, no, no, no.

07:48.640 --> 07:50.840
I have one of the Evangelion dating sims.

07:50.840 --> 08:00.800
I have one of the ones on Saturn, and they're dating sims with combat sequences.

08:00.800 --> 08:01.800
That's all I got.

08:01.800 --> 08:03.520
I did, however, get to End the World.

08:03.520 --> 08:04.520
It was fantastic.

08:04.520 --> 08:06.160
That's all I got for you guys this week.

08:06.160 --> 08:09.120
You know what I need to borrow for the Saturn?

08:09.120 --> 08:11.520
I need to borrow a stall.

08:11.520 --> 08:12.620
That game was awesome.

08:12.620 --> 08:13.620
I love that.

08:13.620 --> 08:16.960
I have a stall.

08:16.960 --> 08:23.440
Anyway, speaking of good games, because I saw it was freaking rad, and this will interest

08:23.440 --> 08:30.880
Chris, Kingdom Hearts 2 is eventually coming out in the UK.

08:30.880 --> 08:31.880
Wee!

08:31.880 --> 08:36.800
No, dear, the wee is not out yet.

08:36.800 --> 08:40.480
That suddenly made me think of Mitch Hedberg, who's like, Wee!

08:40.480 --> 08:43.400
When you're having fun, you mention yourself and other people.

08:43.400 --> 08:44.400
Wee!

08:44.400 --> 08:49.960
Uh, Kingdom Hearts 2 is on its way to Europe very soon.

08:49.960 --> 08:50.960
You will like it.

08:50.960 --> 08:51.960
It's cute.

08:51.960 --> 08:52.960
It really is.

08:52.960 --> 08:53.960
Axel!

08:53.960 --> 08:54.960
Axel!

08:54.960 --> 08:58.400
I think we've got it memorized by now.

08:58.400 --> 08:59.400
Haha.

08:59.400 --> 09:02.960
They don't get that yet unless they imported it.

09:02.960 --> 09:03.960
They will.

09:03.960 --> 09:04.960
Believe me.

09:04.960 --> 09:05.960
They will.

09:05.960 --> 09:10.000
Okay, back to the news before it's really interrupted by Mr. Junami in the corner.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Go eat a donut.

09:12.000 --> 09:18.200
Well, yeah, but there's a difference between you're helping and Junami helping.

09:18.200 --> 09:20.480
That's because I always forgive you because you're cute.

09:20.480 --> 09:22.320
Anyway, she just watched a movie.

09:22.320 --> 09:23.560
And I'm not?

09:23.560 --> 09:25.120
Back to the news, hello.

09:25.120 --> 09:26.120
You're a boy.

09:26.120 --> 09:27.120
Okay, okay.

09:27.120 --> 09:28.120
Yeah, you're a boy.

09:28.120 --> 09:29.120
You don't count.

09:29.120 --> 09:30.120
Who?

09:30.120 --> 09:37.520
Anyway, to our friends in the UK, it will actually be coming out on September 29th.

09:37.520 --> 09:44.320
It actually came out last December in Japan and we got it this year a few months ago.

09:44.320 --> 09:47.380
But honestly, get the game.

09:47.380 --> 09:48.920
When it is out, get it.

09:48.920 --> 09:51.160
It's fantastic.

09:51.160 --> 09:52.160
Lots of great gameplay.

09:52.160 --> 09:56.500
In fact, I actually, but make sure that you do Agrabah and the Pride Lands.

09:56.500 --> 10:00.880
Make sure that you do them because Jamie decided she was going to skip those two places and

10:00.880 --> 10:02.680
now can't get back to them.

10:02.680 --> 10:04.640
AKA you fucked yourself.

10:04.640 --> 10:07.680
I did, so I have to start over from Dan's game because he's right where I am only.

10:07.680 --> 10:08.680
He did those two parts.

10:08.680 --> 10:09.680
Winner.

10:09.680 --> 10:12.680
Who the hell skips areas?

10:12.680 --> 10:16.040
I thought that I was going the right way.

10:16.040 --> 10:17.360
It gave me a choice.

10:17.360 --> 10:19.760
I chose the one I wanted to do pirates and I wanted to do pirates.

10:19.760 --> 10:20.760
You chose wrong.

10:20.760 --> 10:24.960
Hey, I wanted to do pirates in Halloweentown, so you shut up, sir.

10:24.960 --> 10:27.120
Pirates is another great idea.

10:27.120 --> 10:28.120
The pirate version?

10:28.120 --> 10:33.020
I mean, it's really cool just like, hey, it's pirates, but in all honesty, it's not one

10:33.020 --> 10:35.740
of the best areas you can go to.

10:35.740 --> 10:41.200
I wanted to see it because I am a Captain Jack Sparrow fangirl.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.600
It is also about Dreamboat Barbie.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.160
Barboza.

10:45.160 --> 10:51.720
OK, that came from when we were writing Pirates of the Caribbean the second time through when

10:51.720 --> 10:54.840
we were singing with the whole ride, annoying the people in front of us.

10:54.840 --> 10:59.080
And as a and then Barboza's up on the Wicked Wench.

10:59.080 --> 11:02.080
So we decided to call him Dreamboat Barbie.

11:02.080 --> 11:13.040
OK, anyway, guys, get the game September 20th, 29th, you will not be disappointed anyway.

11:13.040 --> 11:28.040
And Rob, you anyway, and as far as also other stuff, OK, these people are giggling and driving

11:28.040 --> 11:29.040
me nuts.

11:29.040 --> 11:30.040
OK.

11:30.040 --> 11:35.960
So Liberty Stories, Grand Theft Auto by City Stories will not be going out until November

11:35.960 --> 11:36.960
in the UK.

11:36.960 --> 11:43.920
It was supposed to be out October 20th, but now it's been pushed back to November 3rd.

11:43.920 --> 11:47.240
That's also another good game if you're into the GTA series, it actually is a really good

11:47.240 --> 11:48.240
addition to PSP.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.720
My man's been pretty happy with it.

11:50.720 --> 11:53.640
And it's also delayed in the United States, too.

11:53.640 --> 11:54.640
November 1st.

11:54.640 --> 11:55.640
What?

11:55.640 --> 11:57.280
No, I was referring to Liberty City Stories.

11:57.280 --> 11:59.240
Oh, is that?

11:59.240 --> 12:01.400
Is that was the story about Liberty City or?

12:01.400 --> 12:02.400
Oh, OK.

12:02.400 --> 12:06.320
I mean, if it's anything like Liberty Series.

12:06.320 --> 12:07.760
You were about to say Liberty Shitty.

12:07.760 --> 12:08.760
I think you were.

12:08.760 --> 12:09.760
No.

12:09.760 --> 12:10.760
Hey, it's my game, bitch.

12:10.760 --> 12:15.720
I'm saying if it was anything like Liberty City Stories, because Dan was playing that

12:15.720 --> 12:21.260
game all the time, keeping me awake here.

12:21.260 --> 12:25.220
I'm not a big fan of Grand Theft Auto, like, you know, I understand why it's so freaking

12:25.220 --> 12:29.220
amazingly popular, but I think I might actually get suckered into playing Saints Row because

12:29.220 --> 12:34.720
as we've all found out, I easily succumb to peer pressure, hence why I'm playing Final

12:34.720 --> 12:35.720
Fantasy XI again.

12:35.720 --> 12:37.280
So we'll probably go to Saints Row, too.

12:37.280 --> 12:40.280
It's a fun casual game, where you casually beat lookers.

12:40.280 --> 12:41.280
I like casual.

12:41.280 --> 12:43.280
I like beating lookers.

12:43.280 --> 12:48.440
Anyways, so, yeah, delayed in the United States till November 1st.

12:48.440 --> 12:51.040
That sucks because I was really looking forward to playing that in October.

12:51.040 --> 12:53.440
Oh, this is going to play some more Liberty City Stories.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.880
Speaking of delays, Forza 2.

12:55.880 --> 13:01.560
It's been rumored to be delayed to 2007, and this is coming straight from the development

13:01.560 --> 13:08.640
team, and it says, I think, their quote is, I think we've always said that it will appear

13:08.640 --> 13:14.800
in our fiscal year, and in our fiscal year I can guarantee that the game will appear.

13:14.800 --> 13:19.280
I can't be specific right now in terms of the actual day of Forza, but certainly it

13:19.280 --> 13:26.920
will be an integral game that appears in our financial year of 07, which is the one we're

13:26.920 --> 13:27.920
in now.

13:27.920 --> 13:33.320
So, it's rumored, let me put it this way, it's not coming out when it was supposed to,

13:33.320 --> 13:38.080
because this is straight, you know, I actually, when I saw this story, I, you know, called

13:38.080 --> 13:42.940
my Microsoft rep and asked them when the fuck this game is coming out, and it's to be announced

13:42.940 --> 13:43.940
right now.

13:43.940 --> 13:48.580
It was in November, I think the 15th, and now it's being pushed back even further.

13:48.580 --> 13:53.480
So we're supposed to know the official date in a couple weeks, so that should be interesting.

13:53.480 --> 13:58.440
What was the other game I was going to mention, Crackdown, was another game that was slated

13:58.440 --> 14:04.660
for the end of, or actually middle of October, and that's been delayed to be announced now.

14:04.660 --> 14:10.400
So now the only Microsoft game coming out in October, Fusion Frenzy 2.

14:10.400 --> 14:14.660
Speaking of delays on the Xbox, if you were the one person that was looking forward to

14:14.660 --> 14:20.520
Scramble coming onto Xbox Live Arcade this week, sorry, but you have to wait one more

14:20.520 --> 14:25.320
week because there was some last minute things that had to be cleaned up with Scramble, and

14:25.320 --> 14:29.320
it's now going to be released this week, probably by the time you hear this podcast, it's already

14:29.320 --> 14:30.320
on the marketplace.

14:30.320 --> 14:33.320
For those of you folks listening live, it'll be out this Wednesday.

14:33.320 --> 14:37.720
So you know, Microsoft has this big Xbox Live Arcade promotion thing going on where they're

14:37.720 --> 14:41.480
trying to release new stuff every Wednesday, so they had to put something out this Wednesday,

14:41.480 --> 14:43.600
so what did we get instead of Scramble?

14:43.600 --> 14:56.480
We got a brand new Uno deck, featuring cards from Project Gotham Racing 3, for 100 points.

14:56.480 --> 15:00.040
I bet less people will be buying this than Scramble.

15:00.040 --> 15:03.600
Well I don't know, actually there's a lot of Uno horse out there, some people pretty

15:03.600 --> 15:09.200
hardcore their Unos, so I don't know, I'm not a big Scramble fan, I don't know why that

15:09.200 --> 15:13.040
one of all games is being ported over to Xbox Live, maybe I just don't remember the game

15:13.040 --> 15:16.300
very well, I'll check out the demo, but I don't know if I'm going to spend the five

15:16.300 --> 15:20.640
bucks on the game, it's a little, yeah, we'll see.

15:20.640 --> 15:23.600
Well you know, at least they're getting it right.

15:23.600 --> 15:24.600
Exactly.

15:24.600 --> 15:28.280
Speaking of things coming out for the 360, Japan is actually getting lucky, you might

15:28.280 --> 15:33.560
remember when the console launched over in Japan, they didn't get a core unit, they basically

15:33.560 --> 15:35.920
just had the premium unit, and that was it.

15:35.920 --> 15:41.320
Well now the 360 core is making its way over to Japan, and they're getting a few additions

15:41.320 --> 15:42.320
to it.

15:42.320 --> 15:46.400
One, the price point is going to be less than what it is in the United States, it's only

15:46.400 --> 15:54.080
going to be 29,800 yen, which is around about $255, which is about 40 bucks less than what

15:54.080 --> 16:00.320
we're paying for it now, and actually what's kind of neat about it is the core pack will

16:00.320 --> 16:08.160
include two games, 99 Nights and Project Gotham Racing 3 as well, so that's pretty cool.

16:08.160 --> 16:13.360
Also the hard drives are supposed to be sold around 85 bucks there too, so, you know, overall

16:13.360 --> 16:17.200
they're getting a pretty good discount, I wish we'd get some bundles over here, but

16:17.200 --> 16:19.880
that's not going to be the case.

16:19.880 --> 16:22.080
And all that's going to be available November 2nd.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.720
Alright, sounds good.

16:24.720 --> 16:32.800
Well, speaking of things that are to be released, you know, the premium Xbox 360, this is in

16:32.800 --> 16:39.320
UK news by the way, is not going to get the price cut for Christmas, but an HD DVD and

16:39.320 --> 16:46.340
console package is coming out, and it's actually been stated that the standalone HD DVD is

16:46.340 --> 16:52.960
going to be out for retail of 199 pounds, so 200 quid, not bad.

16:52.960 --> 17:01.520
It'll be, in Euros that's 293 Euros by the way, and it will come with two HD DVD movies.

17:01.520 --> 17:09.560
Also there's a rumor that the premium console bundle with the movie player will be coming

17:09.560 --> 17:16.320
out around 400 pounds, and the speculations could even be as low as 375.

17:16.320 --> 17:19.600
Why are we hearing more about this in Europe than we are in the US?

17:19.600 --> 17:23.880
The news has been very quiet on the HD DVD expansion here in the US, is Microsoft waiting

17:23.880 --> 17:24.880
for something?

17:24.880 --> 17:25.880
X06?

17:25.880 --> 17:26.880
When is that?

17:26.880 --> 17:27.880
I don't remember.

17:27.880 --> 17:31.680
Because as we speculated last week with the whole, you know, Halo 3 is coming out earlier

17:31.680 --> 17:34.400
in the year, does it seem like Microsoft's going to be holding a press conference soon

17:34.400 --> 17:35.920
where they start announcing a lot of this stuff?

17:35.920 --> 17:36.920
I think so.

17:36.920 --> 17:37.920
Interesting.

17:37.920 --> 17:44.200
Because the other rumor, which we'll get into later, was another racing game.

17:44.200 --> 17:48.240
Microsoft isn't really commenting on it as much yet, and I guess it's for the same reason

17:48.240 --> 17:53.240
that we're not seeing much on it over here, but it's really looking like they're actually

17:53.240 --> 18:00.960
trying to now really take advantage of the UK market, is what it seems like.

18:00.960 --> 18:02.560
I just want to point this out in chat.

18:02.560 --> 18:04.360
The chat is on this big kick right now.

18:04.360 --> 18:08.320
I never understand when the chat room gets on this thing and they beat these inside jokes

18:08.320 --> 18:12.200
into the ground, but right now the joke running in chat right now is breaking news.

18:12.200 --> 18:15.040
People are writing, breaking news, and then something silly after that.

18:15.040 --> 18:16.840
But this one's actually kind of interesting.

18:16.840 --> 18:17.840
It was written here.

18:17.840 --> 18:18.840
Oh, damn it.

18:18.840 --> 18:19.840
I lost my thought.

18:19.840 --> 18:20.840
Oh, there it is.

18:20.840 --> 18:21.840
This was written by, and I apologize.

18:21.840 --> 18:22.840
I'm not sure how to pronounce this name.

18:22.840 --> 18:26.360
It's Nazgu1slayer or something like that.

18:26.360 --> 18:29.480
It's N-A-Z-G-U-1-S-L-A-Y-R.

18:29.480 --> 18:30.480
It's Nazgu1slayer.

18:30.480 --> 18:32.760
Oh, that makes sense.

18:32.760 --> 18:33.760
This just in.

18:33.760 --> 18:38.440
When people buy the Oblivion horse armor, they will buy the PGR deck in UNO.

18:38.440 --> 18:39.440
That's true.

18:39.440 --> 18:40.440
Somebody's going to buy it.

18:40.440 --> 18:42.680
Somebody will buy it, but not me.

18:42.680 --> 18:43.680
Sorry.

18:43.680 --> 18:46.960
UNO's cool and all, but I don't need 100 points for new cards that are basically a commercial

18:46.960 --> 18:48.360
for another Microsoft game.

18:48.360 --> 18:51.040
They need an UNO deck that's the horse armor.

18:51.040 --> 18:54.680
Just showing off the horse armor to get people to buy the horse armor.

18:54.680 --> 18:55.720
You were right, by the way, Jamie.

18:55.720 --> 18:57.720
It's Nazgu1slayer.

18:57.720 --> 19:03.920
Anyways, some stuff that Japan's also going to be seeing a price drop in is going to be

19:03.920 --> 19:05.760
the PlayStation 2.

19:05.760 --> 19:10.840
And that's actually pretty interesting because I don't think any, well, everybody else has

19:10.840 --> 19:17.000
been dropping the price of the PS2, but the PS2's going to be dropping to 19,980 yen,

19:17.000 --> 19:19.120
which is about $170.

19:19.120 --> 19:23.520
It's not too big of a drop, but you know, still an okay drop.

19:23.520 --> 19:33.440
And if I remember correctly, the, what was it, I'm sorry.

19:33.440 --> 19:34.480
That was the old price.

19:34.480 --> 19:35.480
I'm an idiot.

19:35.480 --> 19:36.480
My mistake.

19:36.480 --> 19:37.480
It's okay.

19:37.480 --> 19:38.480
People make mistakes.

19:38.480 --> 19:39.480
It's fine.

19:39.480 --> 19:40.480
Yes.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.480
Should do my research.

19:41.480 --> 19:42.480
I'm not allowed to make mistakes.

19:42.480 --> 19:44.840
Just so you know, the dozens and dozens of people listening to this show are going to

19:44.840 --> 19:46.200
be very upset at you.

19:46.200 --> 19:47.200
I know.

19:47.200 --> 19:50.320
That's okay, you can just give them the raspberry.

19:50.320 --> 19:51.320
I'm sorry.

19:51.320 --> 19:58.400
The new suggested retail price for the PS2 in the, in Japan is going to be 16,000 yen,

19:58.400 --> 20:01.520
which is approximately $138.

20:01.520 --> 20:04.760
Not the $170 as I mentioned previously.

20:04.760 --> 20:09.760
It is effective September 15th, which opens up, which I guess that might be their way

20:09.760 --> 20:15.800
of stealing, you know, the Wii announcement thunder, but whatever.

20:15.800 --> 20:17.760
So yeah, that's going to be happening soon.

20:17.760 --> 20:21.440
In case, you know, you might be one of those people in Japan that hasn't bought a PlayStation

20:21.440 --> 20:23.880
2 yet, which is ridiculous.

20:23.880 --> 20:25.360
All right.

20:25.360 --> 20:29.680
Well, something that is ridiculous is when we have to miss a week of Dark Sakura giving

20:29.680 --> 20:32.920
us her website of the week and we missed it last week.

20:32.920 --> 20:36.920
So that means this week's website is going to be twice as good because Dark Sakura likes

20:36.920 --> 20:41.040
to go up and down and left and right on the internet, BA select start.

20:41.040 --> 20:45.600
And she's, she finds a website that she thinks all of you ought to be checking out right

20:45.600 --> 20:46.600
now.

20:46.600 --> 20:49.520
Dark Sakura, what is the website of the week?

20:49.520 --> 20:54.680
The website of the week is gamer.org, g-a-y-m-e-r.org.

20:54.680 --> 21:00.760
Um, I, stop doing that face.

21:00.760 --> 21:04.160
I'm talking to Junami the dork as usual.

21:04.160 --> 21:06.480
Um, it's actually, it was really cool.

21:06.480 --> 21:10.520
I ran across this, um, just looking randomly.

21:10.520 --> 21:15.720
Um, it's a site basically for gay and gay friendly gaming, pretty much.

21:15.720 --> 21:21.200
Um, in fact, to go ahead and read, um, a little blurb off of the website, it says, you know,

21:21.200 --> 21:23.000
why do you need a gay gamer site?

21:23.000 --> 21:26.780
The truth is in the gaming community, there are some pretty staunchly homophobic players

21:26.780 --> 21:27.780
and gamer.org.

21:27.780 --> 21:28.780
Yeah, Junami.

21:28.780 --> 21:29.780
Yeah.

21:29.780 --> 21:30.780
Who makes faces.

21:30.780 --> 21:34.960
It's about having fun without hearing the bashing.

21:34.960 --> 21:39.040
And that, you know, I like what this here, so I give this site to you as a safe haven

21:39.040 --> 21:41.280
where gaming is a focus, not hate.

21:41.280 --> 21:44.280
There's actually a World of Warcraft guild on here that's on the Blackwing server, their

21:44.280 --> 21:49.520
alliance, um, called Alternatives with an altered dash native.

21:49.520 --> 21:50.520
It's pretty cool.

21:50.520 --> 21:55.480
Um, but I've looked at the site, they've got some, it's some core views, gaming news.

21:55.480 --> 21:59.920
Um, it's a pretty well put together site.

21:59.920 --> 22:05.720
I mean, I'd say not overly a lot to look at, but the information is great.

22:05.720 --> 22:08.960
I love the, you know, tweeting over the community there.

22:08.960 --> 22:14.080
I only have one complaint about this site and that's when you go over the dropdown menus.

22:14.080 --> 22:19.120
I don't like the, the little tinkle noise.

22:19.120 --> 22:23.520
It's fairy dust spreading all over your computer as you visit the site.

22:23.520 --> 22:27.200
It's this high pitched little noise and I'm like, are you gaying my computer?

22:27.200 --> 22:31.860
Well, actually I don't need, I'm in your computer gating you up.

22:31.860 --> 22:34.680
I have to give a shout out to a couple other, although that is a good site.

22:34.680 --> 22:35.680
I have visited this.

22:35.680 --> 22:39.800
I give a shout out to a couple other gay friendly gaming sites because, you know, a couple of

22:39.800 --> 22:41.160
years ago there weren't any.

22:41.160 --> 22:44.160
So it's really nice to see these, you know, gay gamer sites that are awesome.

22:44.160 --> 22:48.120
And one of them I've been visiting a lot recently because they have a hilarious blog.

22:48.120 --> 22:49.120
I love it.

22:49.120 --> 22:52.280
It's gaygamer.net and they have a hilarious blog there.

22:52.280 --> 22:56.320
They've been photoshopping Nintendudes is their latest thing going on and they have

22:56.320 --> 22:59.620
like Nintendudes twink edition and things like that.

22:59.620 --> 23:01.040
It's silly, but it's funny.

23:01.040 --> 23:02.040
To me, it's funny.

23:02.040 --> 23:05.560
Uh, and they got some forums there too, and I also have to mention, uh, gamer experimentations

23:05.560 --> 23:07.040
is another forum I've posted on before.

23:07.040 --> 23:09.440
They have a semi-active community over there.

23:09.440 --> 23:13.200
And when that whole, uh, world of Warcraft, you know, guild thing was going down a couple

23:13.200 --> 23:16.400
months ago, a very, very active discussion going on over there.

23:16.400 --> 23:17.880
So very cool.

23:17.880 --> 23:24.680
Um, speaking of gay and world of Warcraft, some of the sound clips have come out for

23:24.680 --> 23:28.040
the, they've leaked to the internet somehow from the beta or I don't know what some of

23:28.040 --> 23:33.160
the sound clips and some of the new races, including blood elves and drannes.

23:33.160 --> 23:38.960
So now I'm not saying that the blood elfs are gay, but here's a clip of what one of

23:38.960 --> 23:42.320
the things the blood elf says and you be the judge.

23:42.320 --> 23:45.760
Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like me?

23:45.760 --> 23:47.880
Oh my God.

23:47.880 --> 23:48.880
Nob?

23:48.880 --> 23:50.360
No, I don't know.

23:50.360 --> 23:56.640
You must now take back that homophobic joke because I am making one of those.

23:56.640 --> 23:59.520
All right.

23:59.520 --> 24:03.040
You know, I, and there's some great sound clips as well.

24:03.040 --> 24:07.000
That's just to the iceberg, but then get this, the female blood elf seems to be a little

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
bit of a valley girl.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
I don't know.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
You tell me on this one.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.640
I went to under city to get a facial.

24:11.640 --> 24:13.800
Have you seen these people?

24:13.800 --> 24:19.040
I said, you don't have a lower jaw and you're going to give me a facial.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.040
She got mad.

24:20.040 --> 24:21.480
At least I think she did.

24:21.480 --> 24:27.120
You ever heard someone talk with on a lower jaw?

24:27.120 --> 24:30.400
She sounded like a murloc.

24:30.400 --> 24:36.800
Or getting her hair done at a troll shop and winding up with a mohawk and a fricking bone

24:36.800 --> 24:37.800
in her nose.

24:37.800 --> 24:38.800
Getting her hair did.

24:38.800 --> 24:39.800
Kill it.

24:39.800 --> 24:40.800
Kill it.

24:40.800 --> 24:41.800
Kill it.

24:41.800 --> 24:44.600
Although the female Draenei voices are also funny.

24:44.600 --> 24:46.600
Asking if gnomes come with vibrate functions.

24:46.600 --> 24:49.200
This, this, hey, I haven't gotten there yet.

24:49.200 --> 24:50.200
I haven't gotten there yet.

24:50.200 --> 24:51.200
Come on, play it.

24:51.200 --> 24:52.700
You stinking jerk.

24:52.700 --> 24:53.700
Here's the Draenei female.

24:53.700 --> 24:56.000
Do gnomes have a vibrate setting?

24:56.000 --> 24:57.480
I did not call that.

24:57.480 --> 24:58.480
Hey, shut up.

24:58.480 --> 24:59.480
We couldn't hear that over your bitching.

24:59.480 --> 25:02.160
Do gnomes have a vibrate setting?

25:02.160 --> 25:04.040
I'm just curious.

25:04.040 --> 25:05.600
I did not mean to call that.

25:05.600 --> 25:08.420
What is, what is the thing with gnomes and the Draenei?

25:08.420 --> 25:09.840
Is there some type of connection there?

25:09.840 --> 25:10.840
I don't know.

25:10.840 --> 25:11.840
Is it a fetish thing?

25:11.840 --> 25:12.960
The Draenei are tall.

25:12.960 --> 25:13.960
Gnomes are short.

25:13.960 --> 25:21.280
There's a, there's a joke in D&D, in third edition at least, that they're, it's something,

25:21.280 --> 25:24.320
I don't think it's, um, it's with gnomes though.

25:24.320 --> 25:25.320
They're puntable.

25:25.320 --> 25:26.560
That's all things to be said.

25:26.560 --> 25:28.560
Gnomes like to move around or something.

25:28.560 --> 25:29.560
I don't think dumb like that.

25:29.560 --> 25:30.560
I don't know.

25:30.560 --> 25:31.560
I heard it a while ago.

25:31.560 --> 25:32.560
I don't know what I'm talking about.

25:32.560 --> 25:33.560
I'm just trying to talk.

25:33.560 --> 25:34.560
All right.

25:34.560 --> 25:36.800
Um, now I have to, now you may have noticed that the Draenei appear to have a little bit

25:36.800 --> 25:38.880
of a Russian accent going on.

25:38.880 --> 25:42.760
Now tell me if that isn't downright blatant in this clip of the male that we have.

25:42.760 --> 25:44.600
I love this planet.

25:44.600 --> 25:48.900
I come here, I see cow and chicken and ride little horses.

25:48.900 --> 25:50.900
This planet has everything.

25:50.900 --> 25:55.200
Oh my God, it's a, it's Balki.

25:55.200 --> 25:56.200
Oh no.

25:56.200 --> 25:58.200
What was that show?

25:58.200 --> 26:03.400
They was on perfect strangers.

26:03.400 --> 26:06.040
In old country, boobs did not fly free.

26:06.040 --> 26:08.600
They were disciplined, structured.

26:08.600 --> 26:10.760
That's why we have Uthas brassieres.

26:10.760 --> 26:12.600
They hold boobies in place.

26:12.600 --> 26:16.040
In Soviet Russia.

26:16.040 --> 26:19.800
In the world of Warcraft, Draenei drink you.

26:19.800 --> 26:21.800
I don't know.

26:21.800 --> 26:22.800
Silly.

26:22.800 --> 26:30.040
To add to the cultural influence confusion, male Draenei, their dance animation is the

26:30.040 --> 26:32.320
internet phenomenon tunak tunak tun dance.

26:32.320 --> 26:33.320
That's awesome.

26:33.320 --> 26:37.960
And blood elf males do have the Napoleon Dynamite dance going for them.

26:37.960 --> 26:38.960
Ew.

26:38.960 --> 26:40.040
That's great.

26:40.040 --> 26:41.720
Just to add to their sexual ambiguity.

26:41.720 --> 26:44.040
Even the Napoleon Dynamite is kind of last year's news.

26:44.040 --> 26:45.560
That's kind of, that's kind of awesome.

26:45.560 --> 26:46.760
I hate Napoleon Dynamite.

26:46.760 --> 26:47.760
You hate Napoleon Dynamite?

26:47.760 --> 26:51.040
I'm like the one person in the world that thought that movie was the best thing in the

26:51.040 --> 26:52.040
world.

26:52.040 --> 26:55.200
The problem is that the movie got so hyped up, by the time a lot of people saw it, they

26:55.200 --> 26:56.200
were like, that's it?

26:56.200 --> 27:00.240
No, the only, there's only one thing in the world that needs to live up to the hype and

27:00.240 --> 27:02.280
that's Snakes on a Plane.

27:02.280 --> 27:03.280
And it did.

27:03.280 --> 27:05.280
Snakes on a Plane was fantastic.

27:05.280 --> 27:06.280
Haven't seen it.

27:06.280 --> 27:07.280
Haven't seen it.

27:07.280 --> 27:08.280
On another fucking plane.

27:08.280 --> 27:09.840
Lord help us all.

27:09.840 --> 27:12.560
Yeah, give me my microphone.

27:12.560 --> 27:13.560
Thank you.

27:13.560 --> 27:15.560
God, I fucking hated that movie.

27:15.560 --> 27:17.720
That movie was great.

27:17.720 --> 27:18.720
It was dumb.

27:18.720 --> 27:19.720
Anyways.

27:19.720 --> 27:28.360
Speaking of really stupid things, in World of Warcraft, Planes on Snakes.

27:28.360 --> 27:31.160
Give me my jump rope back.

27:31.160 --> 27:32.160
Anyways.

27:32.160 --> 27:40.960
Speaking of really dumb, dumb, dumb speculation, there was a, I guess, a story posted about

27:40.960 --> 27:45.240
how some cryptologists have figured out the weed aid.

27:45.240 --> 27:46.920
And here's how they did it.

27:46.920 --> 27:47.920
Roman numerals.

27:47.920 --> 27:49.920
Oh god, I heard about that.

27:49.920 --> 27:50.920
Roman numerals.

27:50.920 --> 27:56.760
Because, you see, a W is actually, looks like two Vs, which would equal ten.

27:56.760 --> 28:05.320
And the two Is would be two, therefore, October 2nd, therefore, they are stupid, is my opinion

28:05.320 --> 28:08.320
on the whole thing.

28:08.320 --> 28:15.440
Look, with all due respect to the sites that ran this story, why is this news?

28:15.440 --> 28:18.440
Why is this news?

28:18.440 --> 28:21.000
This is not news.

28:21.000 --> 28:27.400
Me coming over there to strangle you for running stories like this that perpetuate these stinking

28:27.400 --> 28:30.760
rumors, that would be news.

28:30.760 --> 28:34.120
That is great video game journalism when I come strangle you for running these stories

28:34.120 --> 28:36.400
around the internet.

28:36.400 --> 28:37.400
Thank you.

28:37.400 --> 28:39.360
That just broke my ear.

28:39.360 --> 28:40.360
You're welcome.

28:40.360 --> 28:41.360
I got you back for earlier.

28:41.360 --> 28:43.040
Oh no, I guess that was Jamie who did it earlier.

28:43.040 --> 28:44.040
That was me.

28:44.040 --> 28:45.040
Traitor.

28:45.040 --> 28:46.040
Traitor.

28:46.040 --> 28:50.880
I have to say this, because in the chat room here, I'm not sure if this is Cage or Kage,

28:50.880 --> 28:51.880
it's probably Kage.

28:51.880 --> 28:52.880
Kage.

28:52.880 --> 28:56.720
Snakes, oh, whoops, that's not what I was, that's not the comment I wanted to read.

28:56.720 --> 29:02.640
Kage said this, World of Warcraft is YTMND with a level cap.

29:02.640 --> 29:05.600
That's kind of a good way to sum it up.

29:05.600 --> 29:06.920
I like that comment.

29:06.920 --> 29:07.920
True.

29:07.920 --> 29:10.200
Who is the snake with?

29:10.200 --> 29:13.280
Nothing, it's about what made the movie I rated.

29:13.280 --> 29:14.280
Rob.

29:14.280 --> 29:15.280
Yes.

29:15.280 --> 29:16.280
Rob.

29:16.280 --> 29:17.280
Yes.

29:17.280 --> 29:18.280
Rob.

29:18.280 --> 29:19.280
Rob.

29:19.280 --> 29:20.280
Traitor.

29:20.280 --> 29:22.320
So is it my turn now?

29:22.320 --> 29:25.920
You want to report this on your blogs, I'll give you a worldwide exclusive.

29:25.920 --> 29:30.120
Sky leaves Orange Lounge Radio right before episode 200, amazing.

29:30.120 --> 29:31.800
And no one cares.

29:31.800 --> 29:33.160
Yeah, no one cares, no one running.

29:33.160 --> 29:35.240
And we replace him with a flask of coffee.

29:35.240 --> 29:41.800
You have to understand, no one's going to believe that you left the show until IGN reports

29:41.800 --> 29:44.520
it anyways.

29:44.520 --> 29:48.160
Yes next week I'm going to be- And first it has to circulate on 1UP.

29:48.160 --> 29:52.320
That's the big news for next week's show, is that I'm replaced with a blood elf male

29:52.320 --> 29:53.320
actually.

29:53.320 --> 29:56.440
Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like me?

29:56.440 --> 29:57.440
Anyway.

29:57.440 --> 30:02.400
No, your girlfriend won't put your feet in.

30:02.400 --> 30:03.400
Okay.

30:03.400 --> 30:04.680
Back to the news.

30:04.680 --> 30:06.600
My God, you people are random.

30:06.600 --> 30:09.040
I blame Junami's presence.

30:09.040 --> 30:18.320
Anyway, as he bowels, bowels, oh my God, oh my God, I just cleaned the carpet, Drew.

30:18.320 --> 30:21.280
RG paper trained, please.

30:21.280 --> 30:22.280
Okay.

30:22.280 --> 30:30.480
Our dear friends at Squeenix are being sued by Softworld International for 3.78 million

30:30.480 --> 30:32.480
dollars.

30:32.480 --> 30:41.440
Now, apparently Squeenix owed them a source code for an MMO and did not provide it in

30:41.440 --> 30:42.440
enough time.

30:42.440 --> 30:48.320
So they said, uh-uh-uh, you affected our sales, bitches, pay.

30:48.320 --> 30:51.400
And that's the story.

30:51.400 --> 30:53.000
I could be on CNN.

30:53.000 --> 30:59.440
Somebody had a five-hour time!

30:59.440 --> 31:01.880
DMN has a new nickname for Drew.

31:01.880 --> 31:02.880
Poodami.

31:02.880 --> 31:04.880
How old are we?

31:04.880 --> 31:06.880
He said poo.

31:06.880 --> 31:13.280
Does this mean I have to team up with Pooh Eater?

31:13.280 --> 31:14.280
Hey, Drew, are these-

31:14.280 --> 31:16.760
Then we won't have to worry about a mess.

31:16.760 --> 31:17.760
Pooh Maker and Pooh Eater.

31:17.760 --> 31:20.120
Are these poo jokes making you angry?

31:20.120 --> 31:21.120
Very angry.

31:21.120 --> 31:22.120
Then you know what time it is.

31:22.120 --> 31:38.760
FUs of the week time.

31:38.760 --> 31:44.680
My FU of the week goes towards the really- no, no, no, no, no, it wasn't that.

31:44.680 --> 31:48.380
I actually do not quite recall what it was I was so angry about because I was really

31:48.380 --> 31:50.420
freaking angry.

31:50.420 --> 31:52.360
Was it when you called me from downtown earlier?

31:52.360 --> 31:53.360
No.

31:53.360 --> 31:55.820
Well, okay, this is my- and I hate to resort to traffic.

31:55.820 --> 31:57.500
This is what it was.

31:57.500 --> 32:01.640
Fucking person who almost ran into me while I was on the 80.

32:01.640 --> 32:03.640
On your car?

32:03.640 --> 32:11.420
No, it was some dumbass was swerving to avoid another dumbass and nearly ran into me and

32:11.420 --> 32:12.420
I swerved.

32:12.420 --> 32:16.320
I managed to stay in my lane, but like five people behind me had to pull into the gut-

32:16.320 --> 32:21.780
the side because they were all swerving and I'm like shhh.

32:21.780 --> 32:27.520
And then all the traffic on the day bridge since they did all the work on it.

32:27.520 --> 32:28.520
Aren't they done with the work though?

32:28.520 --> 32:31.280
They're supposed to be, but it was still stupid.

32:31.280 --> 32:40.640
Great nude genius idiot backup.

32:40.640 --> 32:42.600
I personally dislike you now.

32:42.600 --> 32:43.600
Alright.

32:43.600 --> 32:45.680
But I'm also lying.

32:45.680 --> 32:46.680
Low-key.

32:46.680 --> 32:47.680
Anyway.

32:47.680 --> 32:48.680
Um.

32:48.680 --> 33:00.800
F you to- to all those sites out there who just forget that we report news a week early

33:00.800 --> 33:06.240
and take it from the big guys, including people that post in their blogs on these so-called

33:06.240 --> 33:09.800
sites about stuff that's gonna happen.

33:09.800 --> 33:10.800
You know?

33:10.800 --> 33:11.800
Whatever.

33:11.800 --> 33:13.920
I give up.

33:13.920 --> 33:17.280
And also fuck you to Blaze Angels because that game sucks and I'm done with you bitch!

33:17.280 --> 33:18.280
I'm done with you!

33:18.280 --> 33:21.000
I'm gonna kick you to the fucking curb!

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
Or GameStop.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.600
Or the curb in front of GameStop.

33:25.600 --> 33:29.640
My F you of the week goes to the amazing off-topicness of tonight's show.

33:29.640 --> 33:30.640
It's amazing.

33:30.640 --> 33:33.620
You know, because we're gonna have a lot of new listeners tonight thanks to the DDR stuff

33:33.620 --> 33:36.200
so you know, wow, we're doing well.

33:36.200 --> 33:42.400
And then I would also say F you to just how crazy my work has been.

33:42.400 --> 33:48.080
Next week is gonna suck and it makes me wanna cry but you know, it's a job.

33:48.080 --> 33:49.080
Pays the rent.

33:49.080 --> 33:50.080
What can I say?

33:50.080 --> 33:54.480
Chris, do you have any F yous?

33:54.480 --> 33:59.760
My F you goes to whoever invented the United States.

33:59.760 --> 34:05.520
He sucks and needs to get resurrected and die again because as most of you know, my

34:05.520 --> 34:07.400
girlfriend lives in Wisconsin.

34:07.400 --> 34:09.680
I live in Northern California.

34:09.680 --> 34:12.600
I can't walk there and it makes me sad.

34:12.600 --> 34:13.600
I miss her a lot.

34:13.600 --> 34:15.600
It makes me sad when she's not here.

34:15.600 --> 34:18.480
What happened to the pedestrians?

34:18.480 --> 34:19.480
Fuck pedestrians!

34:19.480 --> 34:20.480
Fuck America!

34:20.480 --> 34:22.480
I want her right here!

34:22.480 --> 34:30.280
I thought it was gonna be a political rant and then it was just a F you to the distance.

34:30.280 --> 34:31.280
My heart aches.

34:31.280 --> 34:32.280
Gush, gush, gush.

34:32.280 --> 34:33.280
Cute.

34:33.280 --> 34:37.280
Should it hurt me trying to get rid of her on the phone?

34:37.280 --> 34:40.560
Like not get rid of her but when I was talking to her on the phone during the break, I was

34:40.560 --> 34:41.560
going, I miss you!

34:41.560 --> 34:42.560
I love you!

34:42.560 --> 34:43.560
She's like, I miss you!

34:43.560 --> 34:44.560
Okay, I gotta go.

34:44.560 --> 34:45.560
I miss you!

34:45.560 --> 34:46.560
I love you!

34:46.560 --> 34:47.560
And I'm not that sad.

34:47.560 --> 34:48.560
I just threw up in my mouth.

34:48.560 --> 34:49.560
Shut up!

34:49.560 --> 34:50.560
I'm a girl.

34:50.560 --> 34:51.560
Alright, Drew, any F yous?

34:51.560 --> 35:00.280
Alright, F you to friends of mine who call in on their 21st and ask me to roll a DC 15

35:00.280 --> 35:02.800
check against their fortitude to see if they're drunk.

35:02.800 --> 35:05.520
I shit you not.

35:05.520 --> 35:08.800
He had me roll to see if he was drunk on four running trunks.

35:08.800 --> 35:11.800
Roll the dice to see if I'm getting drunk!

35:11.800 --> 35:12.800
Yeah, you are!

35:12.800 --> 35:14.800
Is there any girls there?

35:14.800 --> 35:15.800
Yeah!

35:15.800 --> 35:20.320
If there's any girls there, I want to do them!

35:20.320 --> 35:21.320
There you have it.

35:21.320 --> 35:22.960
God, kill me now.

35:22.960 --> 35:26.200
And there were, and I did, but I wasn't there.

35:26.200 --> 35:28.200
I was playing Ogres.

35:28.200 --> 35:33.120
You're not there, you're getting drunk!

35:33.120 --> 35:37.560
Also, a big F you to guild drama on my server.

35:37.560 --> 35:39.280
It really sucks ass.

35:39.280 --> 35:41.800
Silverwing wanted to know if he failed, by the way.

35:41.800 --> 35:45.560
He did fail his, he did fail his check.

35:45.560 --> 35:50.800
His DC 15, he rolled an 8.

35:50.800 --> 35:56.880
Wow, you know, shows like this drive me to drink.

35:56.880 --> 35:59.240
Games like this might drive me to drink too, I'm not sure.

35:59.240 --> 36:00.240
No, it might be okay.

36:00.240 --> 36:06.120
It's a game coming out from Ubisoft and it's called Alive, supposedly going to be coming

36:06.120 --> 36:07.120
out in 2007.

36:07.120 --> 36:10.120
It was first talked about in March 2006.

36:10.120 --> 36:15.100
What makes this interesting is that this game has been referred to as an Action Plus title.

36:15.100 --> 36:20.060
It's a genre that, let's see, who is this person, the International Herald Tribune writer

36:20.060 --> 36:27.760
Doreen Carvajal has spun into Ubisoft's attempt to focus on what the writer says is the feminine

36:27.760 --> 36:29.960
side of gaming.

36:29.960 --> 36:34.960
In other words, the reason is because Alive is more oriented toward drama, more life and

36:34.960 --> 36:36.220
characters, more depth.

36:36.220 --> 36:40.720
It's about surviving, but you can't resolve things by shooting only.

36:40.720 --> 36:44.960
You see, Alive features characters who rely on their instincts and each other to endure

36:44.960 --> 36:46.840
after an earthquake.

36:46.840 --> 36:49.480
So in other words, boring!

36:49.480 --> 36:52.880
So apparently, girls like boring games, who knew?

36:52.880 --> 36:54.880
Fuck that noise!

36:54.880 --> 36:55.880
Okay.

36:55.880 --> 36:58.160
That was not nice.

36:58.160 --> 37:00.440
I like killing things as much as an S person.

37:00.440 --> 37:05.040
In all seriousness, if Ubisoft wants to make the ultimate girl game, what should they be

37:05.040 --> 37:08.920
making?

37:08.920 --> 37:11.360
A Lorena Bob at the MMO.

37:11.360 --> 37:16.160
Next topic!

37:16.160 --> 37:25.760
They need to make fucking Barbie Horse Adventures 6, you know, Barbie with a Vengeance or something.

37:25.760 --> 37:26.760
Barbie fucks you up.

37:26.760 --> 37:32.400
No, it was a really good girl game, I thought.

37:32.400 --> 37:33.400
It was for the computer.

37:33.400 --> 37:34.400
Alice.

37:34.400 --> 37:35.400
American McGee's Alice.

37:35.400 --> 37:37.680
That was a fucking great game.

37:37.680 --> 37:38.680
I love that.

37:38.680 --> 37:39.680
Drugs.

37:39.680 --> 37:43.200
Yeah, maybe if you're a girl smoking crack.

37:43.200 --> 37:48.120
IGN ripping off O.L.R. said magazine Chris is pro-lesbian too.

37:48.120 --> 37:49.120
What?

37:49.120 --> 37:50.120
What is that from?

37:50.120 --> 37:51.120
For a game suggestion.

37:51.120 --> 37:52.120
Oh, okay.

37:52.120 --> 37:53.120
Oh, that's hot.

37:53.120 --> 37:54.120
Eh.

37:54.120 --> 37:55.120
A bunch of us making out.

37:55.120 --> 37:56.120
Anywho.

37:56.120 --> 38:00.800
Speaking of games for girls, Dead Rising is supposed to be getting some download content

38:00.800 --> 38:02.200
here pretty soon.

38:02.200 --> 38:06.360
Actually, they did get some download content, but there's going to be some coming to in-store

38:06.360 --> 38:08.120
kiosks as well.

38:08.120 --> 38:14.280
If you actually check online, they do have on the marketplace a brand new costume, I

38:14.280 --> 38:15.280
guess.

38:15.280 --> 38:17.280
Cold-hearted snake is what it's called.

38:17.280 --> 38:19.240
No idea what that looks like because I haven't actually played it.

38:19.240 --> 38:20.240
It looks like Paula Abdul.

38:20.240 --> 38:22.160
No, it's a snake outfit.

38:22.160 --> 38:25.520
Or, not like solid snake, but it looks like snake skin is your suit.

38:25.520 --> 38:27.520
It's like a snake skin suit.

38:27.520 --> 38:28.520
Exactly.

38:28.520 --> 38:29.920
So that's kind of cool.

38:29.920 --> 38:36.160
And then in the in-store kiosks, they're supposed to be getting Accountant, Burgundy Wine, Pure

38:36.160 --> 38:38.440
White Suit, and Stripe.

38:38.440 --> 38:43.380
And those are going to be available in Keys and the brand new September Kiosk disc.

38:43.380 --> 38:45.920
So look for that pretty soon.

38:45.920 --> 38:52.000
Alright, something to look for in the far off future would be Project Gotham Racing

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
4.

38:53.000 --> 38:57.000
The French site just confirmed that there is supposed to be a fourth installment of

38:57.000 --> 38:58.680
Project Gotham Racing.

38:58.680 --> 39:02.760
Now, honestly though, is this a surprise to anyone?

39:02.760 --> 39:03.760
Nope.

39:03.760 --> 39:07.760
Probably not, so I'm not even sure why we're reporting on this, but there you go.

39:07.760 --> 39:12.000
It's making their news around different web blogs this week that Project Gotham 4 looks

39:12.000 --> 39:16.840
like it's been confirmed because it's through this contest, or it's through the site that's

39:16.840 --> 39:21.040
talking about having a contest for designing the car and the winning design will be on

39:21.040 --> 39:23.280
Project Gotham Racing 4.

39:23.280 --> 39:27.480
Just like Test Drive Unlimited.

39:27.480 --> 39:35.320
And actually neat news, sorry, you know, Project Gotham 4 has, it's going to be in my house

39:35.320 --> 39:40.920
and it's going to annoy the crap out of me, just like its predecessors did.

39:40.920 --> 39:46.960
But there is some news, who of our listeners reads Vibe Magazine?

39:46.960 --> 40:01.680
Yeah, not usually the best known thing for gaming news, however, that they had $150 under

40:01.680 --> 40:05.920
a description for the Wii in their last issue.

40:05.920 --> 40:16.760
In fact, I'm looking at the image now, it has down at the bottom just a little description

40:16.760 --> 40:23.600
about all the stuff that's going to be on it, it says $150, www.nintendo.com.

40:23.600 --> 40:33.480
So we're not sure if that's actually going to be, just based off of rumors or if it's

40:33.480 --> 40:38.120
going to be more in the, you know, close to $300 range like we were hearing before.

40:38.120 --> 40:41.440
I think it's a rumor.

40:41.440 --> 40:44.600
I think that they've posted, you know, unsubstantiated information.

40:44.600 --> 40:48.880
I think it was just a placeholder that accidentally went to print that shouldn't have, I don't

40:48.880 --> 40:49.880
think it means anything.

40:49.880 --> 40:54.120
But of course, you know, wasn't there those rumors saying that the Europe site said it

40:54.120 --> 40:58.520
was going to be 150 pounds, so, you know, 150 pounds would be a lot from here.

40:58.520 --> 41:02.640
Well, yes, but, you know, usually like if it's $299 here, like look at the PlayStation

41:02.640 --> 41:07.160
3, it's going to be $599 here, or $599 over there, so, you know, possible.

41:07.160 --> 41:12.400
I'm actually, I think converting that would bring it up to at least a 200.

41:12.400 --> 41:18.000
I know it's not possible, but can you imagine if they, like, release that for $99.99?

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
That would be phenomenal.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.600
It would fly off the shelves.

41:21.600 --> 41:22.600
Everyone would own a Wii.

41:22.600 --> 41:26.720
That would be awesome, but even $199 is going to be pretty good.

41:26.720 --> 41:32.000
But hey, well you're going to know in a couple of days anyway, so who cares?

41:32.000 --> 41:35.160
Alright well this is the part of the show where we open it up to you guys to call us

41:35.160 --> 41:36.400

41:36.400 --> 41:39.800

41:39.800 --> 41:41.320

41:41.320 --> 41:42.320
That's the way to do it.

41:42.320 --> 41:48.280
Or you can pick up the phone and dial 916-226-9067, but kids, please keep in mind that that is

41:48.280 --> 41:53.000
not a toll-free number, so if you're not paying the phone bill, don't call it.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.320
Download Skype and use that for free.

41:54.320 --> 41:57.040
Our username on Skype is Orangelaunchradio.

41:57.040 --> 41:58.760
And looky look, the calls are already coming in.

41:58.760 --> 42:02.200
Hello, you're on Orangelaunchradio, who's this?

42:02.200 --> 42:03.600
Once again, I am number one.

42:03.600 --> 42:04.600
Damn, I'm good.

42:04.600 --> 42:06.720
Yeah, you just had to stick your finger there.

42:06.720 --> 42:07.720
Hi, Ron Jon.

42:07.720 --> 42:08.720
DJ Rama.

42:08.720 --> 42:10.720
Hey, I hear you're a snitch.

42:10.720 --> 42:13.840
Well, what can I say?

42:13.840 --> 42:15.760
Someone pays my bills.

42:15.760 --> 42:22.600
My finger is floating over the hang-up button, so you better have something good to say.

42:22.600 --> 42:26.400
Well, I have a lot of good stuff to say, because you know, if you're going to do that, I wasn't

42:26.400 --> 42:29.400
going to preach you to Dunkin' Donuts when you came to New York City.

42:29.400 --> 42:31.240
Okay, then maybe I won't hang up on you.

42:31.240 --> 42:32.240
What's on your mind, buddy?

42:32.240 --> 42:33.240
Oh, a few things.

42:33.240 --> 42:38.320
I want to say hi to everybody in the studio, and a special hello to the Angel of Death

42:38.320 --> 42:39.320
Loki.

42:39.320 --> 42:40.320
Hi.

42:40.320 --> 42:46.160
Oh, I forgot to mention, yes, this is kind of funny.

42:46.160 --> 42:49.920
They had screenshots from Africa get posted this week.

42:49.920 --> 42:50.920
Africa.

42:50.920 --> 42:53.800
Can we figure out what the game's about yet?

42:53.800 --> 42:54.800
Nope.

42:54.800 --> 42:55.800
It's just pictures of animals.

42:55.800 --> 42:57.800
It's about animal poo.

42:57.800 --> 42:58.800
Hooray.

42:58.800 --> 42:59.800
Africa.

42:59.800 --> 43:00.800
Africa.

43:00.800 --> 43:01.800
All right.

43:01.800 --> 43:02.800
What's on your mind, really, Rama?

43:02.800 --> 43:06.640
Well, I play DDR Supernova, and I'm in love.

43:06.640 --> 43:07.640
Really?

43:07.640 --> 43:09.360
What did you love about DDR Supernova?

43:09.360 --> 43:11.200
I just love the eye candy to it.

43:11.200 --> 43:18.280
I mean, the new videos, all the new characters dancing, especially Emmy's new costume.

43:18.280 --> 43:19.280
Emmy's new costume.

43:19.280 --> 43:23.760
What would you say is your favorite song in DDR Supernova?

43:23.760 --> 43:28.840
I only got just to play one song, and right now, I was floored by Centerfold.

43:28.840 --> 43:30.920
Oh, the Captain Jack song?

43:30.920 --> 43:31.920
Yes.

43:31.920 --> 43:35.080
All right, that's cool.

43:35.080 --> 43:38.480
So are you going to be picking up the home version when it comes out for PS2?

43:38.480 --> 43:39.480
Fuck yes.

43:39.480 --> 43:40.480
All right.

43:40.480 --> 43:41.480
Sounds good.

43:41.480 --> 43:43.040
You know, I hear you can make your own steps at home and then take them to the arcade.

43:43.040 --> 43:44.040
It should be fun.

43:44.040 --> 43:45.040
Like the old days?

43:45.040 --> 43:46.040
That would be awesome, but...

43:46.040 --> 43:47.040
Like the old days?

43:47.040 --> 43:48.040
Hmm?

43:48.040 --> 43:49.040
It's like the old days.

43:49.040 --> 43:52.320
Yeah, but the machines around here don't have memory cards.

43:52.320 --> 43:53.320
Don't.

43:53.320 --> 43:54.320
They need to get them.

43:54.320 --> 43:56.560
I'm working on it.

43:56.560 --> 43:58.120
All right.

43:58.120 --> 43:59.300
Anything else on your mind, Rama?

43:59.300 --> 44:05.280
I beat New Super Mario Brothers, and Nintendo threw old schoolers a bone in the game.

44:05.280 --> 44:07.280
Oh, what's that?

44:07.280 --> 44:10.400
Wait until you get to the final level in the castle.

44:10.400 --> 44:11.640
That's all I'm going to say.

44:11.640 --> 44:13.000
All right.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
Sounds good.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
All right, Rama.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
We've got to let you go.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
We've got to get more callers, okay?

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
Two more things on my thing.

44:18.000 --> 44:22.480
Number one, I picked up Beat Mania for 40 bucks at Version Megastore, and I'm calling

44:22.480 --> 44:26.240
out Drunami and Nintendo Maniac 64 for bad phone calls.

44:26.240 --> 44:27.240
Come on.

44:27.240 --> 44:29.200
I'm raising the bar here.

44:29.200 --> 44:30.200
Come on.

44:30.200 --> 44:31.200
You can do better than me.

44:31.200 --> 44:32.200
Oh, dear.

44:32.200 --> 44:33.200
Drunami, response?

44:33.200 --> 44:34.840
Damn fighting words.

44:34.840 --> 44:35.840
It's on.

44:35.840 --> 44:36.840
Bring it!

44:36.840 --> 44:37.840
Come on.

44:37.840 --> 44:38.840
Bye, Rama.

44:38.840 --> 44:39.840
Have a good one.

44:39.840 --> 44:40.840
Bye.

44:40.840 --> 44:41.840
All right.

44:41.840 --> 44:42.840
We're going to go to another call here on the-

44:42.840 --> 44:43.840
I'm going to answer.

44:43.840 --> 44:44.840
Skype line.

44:44.840 --> 44:45.840
Huh?

44:45.840 --> 44:46.840
Huh?

44:46.840 --> 44:47.840
I'm going to answer it.

44:47.840 --> 44:48.840
Rob.

44:48.840 --> 44:49.840
Okay.

44:49.840 --> 44:50.840
Africa.

44:50.840 --> 44:51.840
Africa.

44:51.840 --> 44:52.840
Zebra Buzz.

44:52.840 --> 44:53.840
All right.

44:53.840 --> 44:54.840
Let's go to another call here on Orange Lounge Radio.

44:54.840 --> 44:55.840
Hey, you're calling Orange Lounge Radio.

44:55.840 --> 44:56.840
Who's this?

44:56.840 --> 44:57.840
Hi.

44:57.840 --> 44:58.840
This is Solar Wing.

44:58.840 --> 44:59.840
Hi, Solar Wing.

44:59.840 --> 45:00.840
You've never called the show before, have you?

45:00.840 --> 45:01.840
No.

45:01.840 --> 45:03.400
I'm a first time actually live listener.

45:03.400 --> 45:04.400
All right.

45:04.400 --> 45:06.200
We're popping someone's Skype cherry tonight.

45:06.200 --> 45:07.200
That's awesome.

45:07.200 --> 45:09.360
We're happy to have some new blood on the show tonight.

45:09.360 --> 45:10.920
What's on your mind, buddy?

45:10.920 --> 45:14.000
Actually, a few things first.

45:14.000 --> 45:18.560
The PS3 thing, how many do you actually think will actually make it to Canada?

45:18.560 --> 45:25.400
Because it says 400,000 to North America that necessarily mean anything about it just going

45:25.400 --> 45:28.760
to States or Canada or what?

45:28.760 --> 45:32.200
That's a damn good point that I don't know if anyone's really thought of about how many

45:32.200 --> 45:33.660
of those machines are going to Canada.

45:33.660 --> 45:37.640
Everyone assumed North America is just United States, kind of like Europe doesn't exist

45:37.640 --> 45:39.120
and Mexico apparently.

45:39.120 --> 45:44.440
So you know- I think Mexico is getting 350,000.

45:44.440 --> 45:48.200
You want to know what's sad, my friend, is that probably Canada is getting about 10,000

45:48.200 --> 45:49.460
of that.

45:49.460 --> 45:51.720
Don't say that.

45:51.720 --> 45:52.720
Are you a Sony fan?

45:52.720 --> 45:55.780
No, I actually owe someone a PS3.

45:55.780 --> 45:58.120
You owe someone a PS3?

45:58.120 --> 45:59.120
Oh my God.

45:59.120 --> 46:00.940
You must have done something big.

46:00.940 --> 46:01.940
This is what I want to know.

46:01.940 --> 46:02.940
What did you do?

46:02.940 --> 46:03.940
What did you do?

46:03.940 --> 46:08.480
It is a Christmas present, wedding present, birthday present from two years.

46:08.480 --> 46:09.480
Wow.

46:09.480 --> 46:10.480
Oh wow.

46:10.480 --> 46:14.880
So this is like a get out of presents- are you having to make up for presents you forgot?

46:14.880 --> 46:17.200
No, he had a choice.

46:17.200 --> 46:20.280
It was either Xbox 360 or PS3.

46:20.280 --> 46:24.400
He chose the PS3 because he hates me.

46:24.400 --> 46:25.400
I see.

46:25.400 --> 46:30.280
So this is going to be a get out of presents free pass for the next two years, apparently.

46:30.280 --> 46:31.280
I hope so.

46:31.280 --> 46:32.280
Wow.

46:32.280 --> 46:33.280
That's a pretty big one.

46:33.280 --> 46:39.520
Well, you know, even so, I think that with the shipment coming out- so the B sellers

46:39.520 --> 46:42.480
like the other systems are, there shouldn't be any type of region coding or any type of

46:42.480 --> 46:43.480
specification between.

46:43.480 --> 46:44.960
No, no, not for Canada.

46:44.960 --> 46:50.000
So I wouldn't see why you can't order one off of like GameStop site or something like

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
that.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.320
Yeah, you might be able to just order- it might cost a little extra for shipping, but

46:53.320 --> 46:54.680
if we're- Order from Sony style.

46:54.680 --> 46:58.880
Yeah, push came to shove, you could order one from a US website and just have it shipped

46:58.880 --> 46:59.880
to Canada.

46:59.880 --> 47:01.080
Yeah, I could probably do that.

47:01.080 --> 47:05.880
It's just, yeah, $700 as it is, plus how much are the games?

47:05.880 --> 47:12.120
Yeah, true, we're talking $600 American, which is a little bit more in Canadian, although

47:12.120 --> 47:13.320
not much lately.

47:13.320 --> 47:16.160
The dollars are equating pretty soon here.

47:16.160 --> 47:18.760
What part of Canada are you from?

47:18.760 --> 47:20.880
West Coast, near Toronto.

47:20.880 --> 47:21.880
Near Toronto?

47:21.880 --> 47:22.880
Yeah.

47:22.880 --> 47:24.800
Wait, Toronto's not- wait, they consider Toronto the West Coast?

47:24.800 --> 47:25.800
Oh, East.

47:25.800 --> 47:26.800
Sorry.

47:26.800 --> 47:27.800
I was like, wait a minute, wait a minute.

47:27.800 --> 47:28.800
East.

47:28.800 --> 47:29.800
East.

47:29.800 --> 47:30.800
Yeah.

47:30.800 --> 47:33.400
I mean, it's a little bit on the US border, but you can always dip into the US and try

47:33.400 --> 47:36.880
some of the big best buys around the border, could be a thought.

47:36.880 --> 47:46.320
Or even so, a lot of the distributors, the national distributors, are in California.

47:46.320 --> 47:50.840
If you order from any of the distribution sites or any of the other, maybe even at the

47:50.840 --> 47:58.080
importers, you're still probably going to get a system fairly quickly, as far as shipping's

47:58.080 --> 47:59.300
concerned.

47:59.300 --> 48:01.520
My other question was about the new NDSs.

48:01.520 --> 48:02.520
Yeah.

48:02.520 --> 48:03.520
What about them?

48:03.520 --> 48:04.520
Black.

48:04.520 --> 48:05.520
What do you think about them?

48:05.520 --> 48:07.920
I'm getting a pink one, end of story.

48:07.920 --> 48:09.400
I like mine.

48:09.400 --> 48:11.320
It's kind of dirty because it's been in my purse.

48:11.320 --> 48:12.560
Wait, you have the white one?

48:12.560 --> 48:13.560
The white one.

48:13.560 --> 48:16.320
Yeah, you have the virginal white one.

48:16.320 --> 48:18.640
Do you think that they'll actually fix that crack issue?

48:18.640 --> 48:20.920
Oh, the whole, the cracking of the hinges?

48:20.920 --> 48:25.640
I imagine because it was such a big deal on the blogs that they'll do something about

48:25.640 --> 48:29.680
it, but I don't know what can you really do about the hinges without redesigning the whole

48:29.680 --> 48:30.680
setup of the system?

48:30.680 --> 48:31.920
I know mine hasn't yet.

48:31.920 --> 48:37.000
Yeah, I don't think they all have, but I hear the fats are cracking now, too.

48:37.000 --> 48:40.800
One of the blogs I was reading ran a story that their fat was cracking, but it takes

48:40.800 --> 48:45.760
one person with an internet site to have that happen, and then it's all over the internet,

48:45.760 --> 48:48.480
so I don't know exactly how rampant the cracks are.

48:48.480 --> 48:49.480
I haven't seen it.

48:49.480 --> 48:53.760
I think that issue is less widespread than people are thinking.

48:53.760 --> 48:54.760
Get the black one.

48:54.760 --> 48:55.760
You'll be able to see the crack.

48:55.760 --> 48:56.760
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

48:56.760 --> 48:57.760
Yeah, there you go.

48:57.760 --> 48:58.760
There you go.

48:58.760 --> 49:04.920
My last thing, I've played DDR once, and I was looking at getting a PS2.

49:04.920 --> 49:07.240
What should I get for DDR?

49:07.240 --> 49:08.640
Get an ignition pad, first of all.

49:08.640 --> 49:12.360
Yeah, make sure you get a good dance pad, although, well, if he's warming up to DDR,

49:12.360 --> 49:16.780
I'd say a $20 dance pad can hold him over to see if he likes the game, especially because

49:16.780 --> 49:19.880
you can play the basic songs on the cheapo pads.

49:19.880 --> 49:24.320
Once you get into the harder stuff, though, it will start moving under your feet.

49:24.320 --> 49:28.760
I would say, by far, the best home release for PS2 is Extreme 2, the most recent one,

49:28.760 --> 49:31.620
and that'll be the easiest one to find, but you could probably get some of the oldies

49:31.620 --> 49:38.920
for $20 American easily, like Max 2 and DDR Extreme, and they're not bad, but DDR Extreme

49:38.920 --> 49:40.600
2 is by far the best one.

49:40.600 --> 49:44.520
Probably right after Supernova comes out, that will drop in price, and who knows, maybe

49:44.520 --> 49:46.480
actually Supernova is going to be the best one.

49:46.480 --> 49:49.240
I couldn't tell you until after I've played it, but it sounds like it's going to be pretty

49:49.240 --> 49:54.280
good, but Extreme 2 has a lot of radio-friendly songs and things you might have heard of,

49:54.280 --> 49:58.600
before, and not a bunch of crazy stuff that sometimes turns people off to DDR.

49:58.600 --> 50:01.000
Alright, well thanks.

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
Not a problem!

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
Thank you so much for calling in.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
Bye.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.660
Alright, have a good one, buddy.

50:06.660 --> 50:09.800
Good luck with the PlayStation 3 hunting, that's got to be a pain in the ass.

50:09.800 --> 50:12.640
Oh my god, oh, your friend a PlayStation 3?

50:12.640 --> 50:16.400
Like Jamie, if I bought you a PlayStation 3, you don't get anything else the rest of

50:16.400 --> 50:18.400
your life.

50:18.400 --> 50:19.400
That's okay.

50:19.400 --> 50:20.400
You don't really want one.

50:20.400 --> 50:22.320
Yeah, you don't want a PlayStation 3.

50:22.320 --> 50:24.680
If I gave you a PlayStation 3, you'd give it back.

50:24.680 --> 50:29.880
No, if you gave me a PlayStation 3, honestly, I'd sell it on eBay for three times what it's

50:29.880 --> 50:31.240
worth, and then I'd take us all to Disneyland.

50:31.240 --> 50:32.920
Alright, you want to answer the next call, Jamie?

50:32.920 --> 50:34.160
No, I decided not to.

50:34.160 --> 50:35.160
Okay, I will.

50:35.160 --> 50:36.160
No, it's funny.

50:36.160 --> 50:37.160
What?

50:37.160 --> 50:38.160
Yeah.

50:38.160 --> 50:39.160
Africa?

50:39.160 --> 50:40.160
They rendered zebra genitalia.

50:40.160 --> 50:41.160
Oh, yuck.

50:41.160 --> 50:42.160
Oh, zebra cock.

50:42.160 --> 50:43.160
I'm going to throw up my mouth.

50:43.160 --> 50:45.160
Alright, Jamie, answer the next call.

50:45.160 --> 50:49.360
Hi, you've called Orange Jones Radio, feel special.

50:49.360 --> 50:51.840
Who are you?

50:51.840 --> 50:57.200
Apparently they hung up, they didn't feel so special.

50:57.200 --> 50:59.480
They got you and decided to run the other way.

50:59.480 --> 51:02.800
Alright, you want to try this one instead?

51:02.800 --> 51:03.800
Fine.

51:03.800 --> 51:06.360
Hi, you've called Orange Jones Radio.

51:06.360 --> 51:11.440
This guy got a feminine voice.

51:11.440 --> 51:14.160
No, I talk too much, so.

51:14.160 --> 51:15.480
Oh, that's right.

51:15.480 --> 51:18.000
Yeah, so we're letting Jamie answer the calls.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.800
Oh, I'm sorry.

51:20.800 --> 51:23.440
I don't think you've talked enough.

51:23.440 --> 51:24.440
Alright.

51:24.440 --> 51:25.440
Anyways.

51:25.440 --> 51:29.840
What's on your mind, my friend?

51:29.840 --> 51:33.240
Well, something you guys have completely overlooked.

51:33.240 --> 51:37.240
Next Saturday morning is the season premiere of Dance Revolution.

51:37.240 --> 51:38.240
No!

51:38.240 --> 51:43.320
I don't think we overlooked it, we just don't care, my friend.

51:43.320 --> 51:45.600
I will watch it.

51:45.600 --> 51:47.080
I will subject myself.

51:47.080 --> 51:49.560
This is the ultimate in video game journalism right there.

51:49.560 --> 51:51.640
Self-sacrifice for the better of the community.

51:51.640 --> 51:56.840
You know, I'm sure that the entirety of our radio listeners can hear you pointing at Loki.

51:56.840 --> 52:03.520
Listen, I sacrificed myself to watch Viva Pinata, and that show sucked, so.

52:03.520 --> 52:07.320
I watched the Viva Pinata clips on Xbox Live, I thought it was cute.

52:07.320 --> 52:09.320
You're stupid.

52:09.320 --> 52:10.320
Jerk.

52:10.320 --> 52:17.880
Alright, what else is on your mind, DMN?

52:17.880 --> 52:19.360
I can't remember what else.

52:19.360 --> 52:24.960
I know I was gonna bug you guys at Dance Revolution, and the other thing slipped my mind, so.

52:24.960 --> 52:27.960
I think we'll cut this one short and let you hang up on me.

52:27.960 --> 52:29.960
Alright, sounds good.

52:29.960 --> 52:30.960
Click.

52:30.960 --> 52:37.300
Alright, I think we have time for about one more call here, if you want to give us a call,

52:37.300 --> 52:45.720
you can call our username is OrangeLoungeRadio, or you can call our skype line, it's 916-226-9067.

52:45.720 --> 52:46.720
Megsy call.

52:46.720 --> 52:49.760
Megsy's supposed to call us.

52:49.760 --> 52:50.760
Wasn't she the one that hung up?

52:50.760 --> 52:51.760
No.

52:51.760 --> 52:52.760
Megsy.

52:52.760 --> 52:53.760
Let's try, hold on.

52:53.760 --> 52:54.760
Jimmy, you gonna answer this?

52:54.760 --> 52:55.760
Yeah.

52:55.760 --> 52:56.760
You better be Megsy.

52:56.760 --> 52:57.760
Yeah, this is Megsy.

52:57.760 --> 52:58.760
Hi sweetie!

52:58.760 --> 52:59.760
Wow, hi.

52:59.760 --> 53:05.760
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, this must be Megsy.

53:05.760 --> 53:07.760
This is Megsy.

53:07.760 --> 53:08.760
Hey.

53:08.760 --> 53:11.760
What's on your mind, Megsy?

53:11.760 --> 53:17.800
Uh, okay, first, anyone in the chat room who was listening, do not go to my DeviantArt

53:17.800 --> 53:20.240
site, do not look at my bad art.

53:20.240 --> 53:23.760
It is not bad, Megsy, you're kind of breaking up, be careful.

53:23.760 --> 53:25.760
Okay, uh, better?

53:25.760 --> 53:27.760
Yes, better, much better.

53:27.760 --> 53:30.760
Okay, don't go to my DeviantArt site.

53:30.760 --> 53:33.760
Go to it, look at all of her art, it's beautiful.

53:33.760 --> 53:38.760
That was during the bonus segment, podcasters didn't hear it anyway, so, or the podcasters

53:38.760 --> 53:39.760
didn't hear it.

53:39.760 --> 53:40.760
Yeah, don't worry about it, the majority of them won't go there.

53:40.760 --> 53:41.760
Alright.

53:41.760 --> 53:48.520
Okay, the other thing is, um, about the Nintendo conference.

53:48.520 --> 53:51.000
The Nintendo conference.

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
What about it?

53:52.000 --> 53:58.560
Um, gosh, I have been waiting, I am counting the hours until the press conference.

53:58.560 --> 54:00.680
Are you a Reggie fangirl?

54:00.680 --> 54:03.620
I am so totally a Reggie fangirl.

54:03.620 --> 54:08.680
I really hope he gets up there and holds up his 40 and goes, this one's for my homies

54:08.680 --> 54:13.440
at OLR, weeee!

54:13.440 --> 54:16.000
What are you looking forward to seeing at the WE press conference?

54:16.000 --> 54:21.800
Is it just the date and the price to get the anticipation building so you can start taking

54:21.800 --> 54:25.960
pre-orders or are you hoping to see some new games or what?

54:25.960 --> 54:30.600
I just want to know when I can get it and how much it is and I want to be able to run

54:30.600 --> 54:36.400
my games, go up and throw my $50 down and so on.

54:36.400 --> 54:39.160
Nintendo, do you think they are going to start taking pre-orders right after the conference

54:39.160 --> 54:41.040
or what do you think will happen?

54:41.040 --> 54:43.040
I really, really hope so.

54:43.040 --> 54:45.040
Alright, sounds good.

54:45.040 --> 54:47.640
You're breaking up a little bit, Meg Z, so unfortunately I think we're going to have

54:47.640 --> 54:51.480
to wrap it up, but is there anything else you want to say to our listeners or in-studio

54:51.480 --> 54:52.480
guests?

54:52.480 --> 55:00.160
Uh, Ken Kuduragi, he's the doctor on the crayons, he's still in the world of crayons.

55:00.160 --> 55:02.360
Alright, Chris, do you have anything you want to say to Meg Z?

55:02.360 --> 55:04.360
I love you, sweetheart.

55:04.360 --> 55:05.360
Awww.

55:05.360 --> 55:06.680
Alright.

55:06.680 --> 55:07.680
Take care, sweetie.

55:07.680 --> 55:08.680
Have a good one.

55:08.680 --> 55:09.680
Alright.

55:09.680 --> 55:10.680
Alright.

55:10.680 --> 55:11.680
Yeah, I'm really happy now.

55:11.680 --> 55:12.680
Awww.

55:12.680 --> 55:13.680
That was cute.

55:13.680 --> 55:14.680
Alright.

55:14.680 --> 55:15.680
I'm sorry.

55:15.680 --> 55:16.680
Awww.

55:16.680 --> 55:19.200
Any last- I don't get to see her often, okay?

55:19.200 --> 55:20.200
I know.

55:20.200 --> 55:21.200
I'm allowed to be sentimental.

55:21.200 --> 55:22.200
That's cute.

55:22.200 --> 55:24.840
Thank you for letting me be sentimental on radio.

55:24.840 --> 55:26.600
That radio show is so gay.

55:26.600 --> 55:28.520
I can see the iTunes review now.

55:28.520 --> 55:30.040
Gay video game radio.

55:30.040 --> 55:31.040
Fuck iTunes.

55:31.040 --> 55:32.040
Alright.

55:32.040 --> 55:33.040
No, I love iTunes.

55:33.040 --> 55:34.720
This is where we get a lot of downloads from.

55:34.720 --> 55:35.720
Alright.

55:35.720 --> 55:36.720
Um.

55:36.720 --> 55:37.720
Any last-minute stories?

55:37.720 --> 55:38.720
Um.

55:38.720 --> 55:39.720
Actually, yes.

55:39.720 --> 55:40.720
Okay.

55:40.720 --> 55:41.720
What's on your mind?

55:41.720 --> 55:42.720
I like burritos.

55:42.720 --> 55:43.720
Okay.

55:43.720 --> 55:47.600
Low-key, please help.

55:47.600 --> 55:48.600
Not low-key, but I got something.

55:48.600 --> 55:49.600
Alright.

55:49.600 --> 55:50.600
What do you have?

55:50.600 --> 55:51.600
Just a small little tidbit.

55:51.600 --> 55:57.040
Uh, GameTap is actually putting, uh, Sam & Max Hit the Road on its, uh, list of games.

55:57.040 --> 55:58.040
Oh, yeah.

55:58.040 --> 55:59.040
I heard about that.

55:59.040 --> 56:00.040
That sounds pretty cool.

56:00.040 --> 56:01.040
Oh, yes.

56:01.040 --> 56:02.040
Got the new one, yeah.

56:02.040 --> 56:07.520
It should be launching, and it's exclusive to them for a few weeks, I think.

56:07.520 --> 56:11.480
By the way, DidYouLoseASockInChat says, this podcast puts the gay in gaming.

56:11.480 --> 56:12.480
Damn, right.

56:12.480 --> 56:15.400
I actually have a question for the chat.

56:15.400 --> 56:16.980
But gay can mean happy, right?

56:16.980 --> 56:20.480
So just, you know, there's something for everybody.

56:20.480 --> 56:21.480
We're happy.

56:21.480 --> 56:22.480
What'd you have, Chris?

56:22.480 --> 56:23.480
I just had a question.

56:23.480 --> 56:24.480
Who's played Xenosaga 3?

56:24.480 --> 56:25.480
And how good is it?

56:25.480 --> 56:26.480
Okay, that's a question.

56:26.480 --> 56:27.480
It's gonna take a second.

56:27.480 --> 56:28.480
Yeah, it's gonna take a minute.

56:28.480 --> 56:29.480
Alright.

56:29.480 --> 56:30.480
Yeah, but, anyway.

56:30.480 --> 56:31.480
Oh.

56:31.480 --> 56:32.480
Do you have anything else?

56:32.480 --> 56:33.480
Yes.

56:33.480 --> 56:34.480
Okay.

56:34.480 --> 56:37.440
For my birthday, people chipped in and got me surround sound.

56:37.440 --> 56:43.200
So now I have 5.1 surround sound in my, uh, my living room with my widescreen TV and the

56:43.200 --> 56:44.680
360.

56:44.680 --> 56:45.680
It's awesome.

56:45.680 --> 56:46.680
It's awesome.

56:46.680 --> 56:47.680
Is it pretty?

56:47.680 --> 56:52.900
It's pretty, and they play Saints Row, and here, you know, I can hear the prostitutes

56:52.900 --> 56:56.600
yelling behind me, so then I turn around and go beat their ass.

56:56.600 --> 56:57.600
It's awesome.

56:57.600 --> 56:58.600
Is it awesome like a hot dog?

56:58.600 --> 56:59.600
Yes.

56:59.600 --> 57:00.600
Like a hot dog.

57:00.600 --> 57:03.600
Uh, Nintendo Maniac 64 says my friend has played it.

57:03.600 --> 57:06.400
Funny Dale said I heard that game has a 6 hour cutscene.

57:06.400 --> 57:08.320
I don't know if that would work.

57:08.320 --> 57:10.040
DMN says it blows ass.

57:10.040 --> 57:11.040
Really?

57:11.040 --> 57:12.040
Why?

57:12.040 --> 57:13.040
Well, he may not be talking.

57:13.040 --> 57:18.160
He may just be talking, responding to somebody else again.

57:18.160 --> 57:23.420
Somebody may have asked him, you know, what do you think about, you know, colonoscopies?

57:23.420 --> 57:25.240
He might have been responding to that question.

57:25.240 --> 57:32.200
Ranma said if Reggie comes out with a 40, he better have cornrows.

57:32.200 --> 57:36.920
Sephiroth1215 says Xenosaga is $30 at Circuit City this week, for those of you guys that

57:36.920 --> 57:37.920
like deals.

57:37.920 --> 57:38.920
I already bought it.

57:38.920 --> 57:39.920
I just haven't played it yet.

57:39.920 --> 57:48.400
I actually was a moron and didn't get Xenosaga 2 when it came out, so I have to order that

57:48.400 --> 57:51.480
and wait to play that before I can actually play Xenosaga 3.

57:51.480 --> 57:53.800
DMN is saying Xenosaga 3 is garbage.

57:53.800 --> 57:54.800
Is what?

57:54.800 --> 57:55.800
It's garbage.

57:55.800 --> 57:56.800
Fuck you.

57:56.800 --> 57:57.800
It's blue hair.

57:57.800 --> 58:02.240
I got a half blue hair.

58:02.240 --> 58:06.040
Is it possible that the game might suck even though the first two were good?

58:06.040 --> 58:08.040
Well, again, I haven't played the first two.

58:08.040 --> 58:09.480
I haven't played two.

58:09.480 --> 58:15.720
I really like the first one mainly because I like playing stuff with the storyline and

58:15.720 --> 58:22.280
I don't care if the storyline is bad, kind of, because I really like the art in 3.

58:22.280 --> 58:24.920
Do you like 5 hour miniseries for cutscenes?

58:24.920 --> 58:26.720
If so, it sounds like you'll love it.

58:26.720 --> 58:27.720
Oh yes.

58:27.720 --> 58:29.360
I like a game that plays itself.

58:29.360 --> 58:30.360
I do.

58:30.360 --> 58:31.360
I was playing...

58:31.360 --> 58:33.240
It's a movie that you interact with.

58:33.240 --> 58:34.240
It's fun.

58:34.240 --> 58:35.240
You press the A button once in a while and you're good.

58:35.240 --> 58:42.040
By the way, with actual game news, Exo 6 is taking place in Barcelona on the 27th, 28th

58:42.040 --> 58:43.040
of September.

58:43.040 --> 58:44.040
Okay.

58:44.040 --> 58:47.080
I bet you there's going to be big news out of that.

58:47.080 --> 58:53.440
They're expected to announce new franchises from Bungie.

58:53.440 --> 58:56.840
Well it's probably stuff for Halo 3.

58:56.840 --> 59:00.440
And yeah, fun stuff.

59:00.440 --> 59:04.200
I have one last little tidbit here that's being sent to a private message in chat.

59:04.200 --> 59:08.440
There's a rumor going around that a Wii tech demo of sorts is going to come with a Wii

59:08.440 --> 59:09.440
remote purchase.

59:09.440 --> 59:12.440
It's just a rumor, but that might be interesting.

59:12.440 --> 59:13.680
Some of that stuff you saw at E3...

59:13.680 --> 59:14.680
That's cool.

59:14.680 --> 59:15.680
I collect tech demos.

59:15.680 --> 59:20.080
I actually have like five of the old PlayStation tech demos.

59:20.080 --> 59:21.080
We want to see something crazy.

59:21.080 --> 59:24.240
Go back and look at the old tech demos on the PlayStation and they look pretty damn

59:24.240 --> 59:28.080
good, even by today's standards.

59:28.080 --> 59:31.600
See, Dark Sakura can't say something nice about Sony once in a while.

59:31.600 --> 59:32.600
It was a PlayStation.

59:32.600 --> 59:33.600
Stop hating.

59:33.600 --> 59:37.120
And remember, the PlayStation was born from the Super Nintendo.

59:37.120 --> 59:38.700
In a way, yeah.

59:38.700 --> 59:40.440
So huh.

59:40.440 --> 59:43.840
All right, boys and girls, that's going to bring this edition of Orange Launch Radio

59:43.840 --> 59:44.840
to a close.

59:44.840 --> 59:47.520
Thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening to us tonight.

59:47.520 --> 59:51.520
We really appreciate the fact that you guys tune in to us and support independent radio.

59:51.520 --> 59:52.520
You guys rock.

59:52.520 --> 59:55.440
Now we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.

59:55.440 --> 59:56.960
And we'll start off with Drunami.

59:56.960 --> 01:00:00.960
Drunami, thank you for being here tonight, as always.

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:03.360
And what's your final thought for tonight?

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:04.680
No poo.

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:05.680
Thanks.

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:07.280
Chris, your final thought for tonight?

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:09.360
My final thought is I love you guys.

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:11.440
And I'm sorry for making this place so random.

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:12.440
No, we love you too.

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:13.440
Thank you for being here.

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:14.440
Random is fun.

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:15.440
Yeah.

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:16.440
Old school listeners especially love it.

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:17.440
OK.

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.240
So Loki, your final thought?

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:24.080
I'm just going to take a tomorrow off and hopefully we'll play some more games this

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:25.080
week.

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:26.080
I want to take tomorrow off.

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:27.080
I want to take tomorrow off.

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:28.080
I want to take tomorrow off.

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:29.080
Oh, wait.

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:30.080
I didn't.

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:31.080
All right.

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:33.600
DarkSocker, your final thought?

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:37.720
I've had the best weekend ever.

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:41.200
And I owe it all to my bestest buddy right here.

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:42.200
Aww.

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:43.200
I think I threw up in my mouth.

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:44.200
Shut up.

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:45.400
I'm just kidding.

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:47.480
My final thought is I want potato chips.

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:48.480
Mmm.

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:49.480
Are there any left?

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:50.480
We're good.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:51.480
I ate them all.

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:52.480
I hate you.

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:53.480
No.

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:57.080
We are starting a campaign to call them crisps and to call French fries chips.

01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:58.080
They're not French.

01:00:58.080 --> 01:00:59.080
I see.

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:00.080
I see.

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:01.080
They're chips.

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:02.080
Freedom fries?

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:03.080
No.

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:04.080
Fuck that.

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:05.080
They're chips.

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:06.080
OK.

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:07.080
They're chips.

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:09.380
I forgot to mention, and this is not that important, but it is news, firmware 2.81 came

01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:15.520
out for the PSP, which allows you to use memory sticks that are larger than 4 gigs.

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:16.520
Hurrah.

01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:18.600
And I have one more final thought for you all.

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:19.600
What?

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:20.600
Reject false icons.

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:21.600
Owned.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:24.840
That is not pwnage.

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:25.840
That is homage.

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:26.840
All right.

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:27.840
That is pure ownage.

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:28.840
That is homage.

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:31.560
You know, imitation is the finest form of flattery, my dear.

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:32.560
All right.

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:33.560
We'll see you next week.

01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:38.480
It's, if you thought tonight was crazy, next week, boys and girls, episode 200.

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:39.480
Woo hoo.

01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:40.480
Brace yourselves.

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:43.560
Until then, I'm a very scared Rob Roberts.

01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:46.080
And for Dark Soccer, Loki and myself, good night.

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:47.080
Bend over, Rob.
