20020	25242	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on this lovely Sunday evening, September the 17th of 2006.
25442	29703	It is our 200th episode tonight, so it's a little bit crazy, but that's alright.
29923	32964	What else can we do here to celebrate our 200th episode?
32984	34405	We had a little cake during the break.
34705	36545	Thank you, Chris, for bringing the chocolate cake.
37005	38926	I'm filled with chocolatey goodness now.
38986	39406	It's great.
40166	42167	But we're going to get back into what we do well here.
42207	43487	It is some gaming news.
44048	44988	Loki, start us off.
45253	57557	Yes, and as we talked about in Part A about the Wii being region-free or not being region-free, we still don't know, there is rumors that the PlayStation 3 may be region-free, and there might be confirmation on that.
57837	74243	According to a Resistance Fall of Man video interview posted on Game Videos, the PlayStation 3 may indeed be region-free, and basically the kind of proof for that is that they're talking about multiple versions of the game
74990	82254	All the videos being, you know, put in there in both the high def formats including PAL on one disc.
82674	89858	So people are, you know, kind of assuming, okay, so there's going to be one run of the game that's going to be, you know, throughout the world.
90138	94500	So, you know, maybe kind of some proof that there might be some region free games.
94980	102264	I think, if anything, it's going to be like, you know, the 360 whereas some games are region free if the developers want them, some games aren't.
103084	104285	I think that's probably what you're going to see.
105714	106034	I don't know.
134086	134891	Forget the imports.
134932	136382	I'll just have to live without it.
137426	137866	X-Fire X-Fire X-Fire
166067	168187	I would be very excited to see something like this come to PlayStation 3.
168367	169308	And there was a quote this week.
169888	173928	I believe it was a one-up reporting from a transcript of Viacom's report.
174328	185050	Quote, importantly, Xfire just signed a deal with Sony to create a version of their platform for the new PlayStation 3, which will now enable Xfire to extend its reach further into the huge console gaming market.
186311	194192	And they're saying that Untold Legends Dark Kingdom, which was a PS3 launch exclusive, was in Xfire's PC initialization file.
194727	200712	Now, after this story sat on the internet for a couple days before you folks in the chatroom start yelling at us and telling us, you know, wait a minute, wait a minute.
201012	208098	Yes, we do know little news came out a little later that says, actually, Sony doesn't plan to be fully integrating X-Fire right here.
208458	210180	This was just for this one game.
210660	211240	But you know what?
211441	214123	I still find this partnership to be very interesting nonetheless.
214223	214963	What do you guys think?
215004	216565	I mean, Loki, you know a lot about X-Fire.
216585	217405	Do you use it at all?
217546	218266	Nope.
218386	221649	Well, what do you think about teaming up with a PC-based...
222162	229065	Well, might as well since Sony doesn't seem to know what they're asked from their foot as far as online services go.
229105	231986	Well, how do you know they don't have something already and they just haven't said anything yet?
232686	237508	Because their whole answer is like, yes, our services will be exactly what Xbox Live is.
238214	240975	So, you know, since they can't really innovate on that, I guess.
241495	252877	I don't know, they haven't really said anything about it, and the fact that there's a lack of information about what they're providing on their online service makes me think, hmm, they don't know what they're providing on their online service yet.
253097	255557	They don't have a plan whatsoever.
255997	263799	So, I'm sure, you know, we're going to hear more about their online service and about their games at Tokyo Game Show in a few weeks, but...
264861	270942	Until then, I don't think they know shit about their online service right now, and I think it's just kind of pieced together.
270962	275063	And I think you just said what exactly is going to prove your statement wrong, Tokyo Game Show.
275083	277563	I think we're going to get the answers to our questions there.
277603	284585	Well, until then, I still think that their online service is very pieced together, and I don't know.
285165	286625	It doesn't sound very good so far.
287085	288085	Jamie, any thoughts from you?
288145	292926	I know you don't really do a lot of PC gaming, but... I have AIM.
294427	296408	Well, X-Files kind of like it in a way.
296868	297689	I have AIM.
298689	300810	What if PlayStation 3 had AIM on it?
300830	301370	Would that be cool?
303191	305832	I probably wouldn't use it on there because I'd be too busy playing a game.
306993	307313	Ooh.
308053	308333	All right.
309454	310134	Good thought, I guess.
310414	311394	Anyways, yeah.
312615	312795	So...
313567	314328	PS3, PS4, PS5, PS6, PS7, PS8, PS9, PS10
337063	344126	So you're going to be seeing most of these coming out in the more expensive bundle, but I think a lot of people are going to be getting the more expensive one anyway.
344146	350869	It's kind of like how with the Xbox 360, sure they had the core one available, but people only bought it because the premium was sold out.
351049	354631	So I guess that's their way of making more money off of this.
355691	357332	Or losing less money, I guess.
357832	363595	Well, I was kind of bitter when the only Xbox 360 I could get was a core, because they were making it seem like half and half.
364079	369421	So I think they know that more people want the premiums because the cores are kind of a joke, just like they were with 360 in my opinion.
369521	375223	There's going to be shortages because they're only going to have, what, 400,000 units to launch with North America.
375763	379604	Well, I ain't buying one until at least 2007, so there you go.
379644	381045	There's one more free on the market.
381085	381385	Have fun.
381565	386187	At least with the Wii, they're promising 4 million units by the end of the year, most of which are coming to the United States.
386947	391469	Well, I hope they make good on that or else it better not be the 360 all over again.
391769	392369	So we'll see.
394349	402996	Well, in other news, this actually has to do with the Xbox 360 and some UK news.
403756	409421	There is going to be a free week of Xbox Live for our friends overseas.
411602	420870	It's stating that you'll actually be able to use the services starting on...
423508	432812	20th November I'm sorry, 20th September, my apologies.
432892	433212	Damn it!
434593	434913	Hey!
434953	435753	That's a different song.
437834	438454	Excuse me.
439875	440595	I'll ferret you.
443096	445817	It's not my fault you can't tell your September from your November, okay?
446017	447178	I'm going to throw my hat at you.
447498	449298	If only Nintendo would make that mistake.
451519	452860	Back to the news.
454097	462542	On the 20th of September, Xbox Live will be free to our friends in Europe.
462962	463783	Free access.
464363	466224	And it ends on the 29th.
468705	471467	Actually, it will be at 11.59pm.
471507	472568	I think that's UK time.
473388	478251	So get in all that laggy, scramble Xbox Live action while you can.
478671	480952	Because I played it online and it's laggy.
481273	481453	Well...
482805	500389	Some of the games available right now, just to give a list, is Project Gotham Racing 3, Top Spin 2, Table Tennis, Saints Row, World Cup Soccer, Dark Zero, I'm sorry, Perfect Dark Zero, Street Fighter 2, Hyper Fighting Edition, Texas Hold'em.
501330	501970	Hey, you know what?
502070	503230	Log on, play Uno with us.
504490	505331	Maybe we could do it.
505351	510912	That would be a good way for us to meet some UK listeners, except one of us is going to have to be awake at a god-awful hour for that to happen.
511618	512379	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
541119	549405	Rare, of course, was responsible for a lot of the launch titles, or a couple of launch titles, I should say, for the Xbox 360.
549465	550286	Actually, no, I take that back.
550306	551126	There were only one title.
551427	568138	Anyways, they had a launch title for the 360, Perfect Dark Zero, and now, of course, I'm going to be announcing some more titles at X06, which is later this month, including, well, some thoughts at least, Banjo-3, or Killer Instinct, or some of the...
569468	570769	BlackWolf is saying, skip four, you tit!
601627	603607	and he also said, draw for you, bloody bloke!
604908	607128	Whatever, that was my worst British accent ever, by the way.
608568	609589	Yeah, sorry, I won't do that again.
610269	610949	Sorry, UK folks.
611329	611889	I apologize.
612289	613970	I apologize to the entire United Kingdom.
615290	615790	Oh, that's right.
617210	620991	I knew it was a couple, and I have to go and correct myself again.
622031	626912	Moving on to another story, Final Fantasy XII, something about the current gen systems.
626952	629693	I know we've had a lot of next gen news, but something about the current gen systems.
630211	634974	They're actually going to be having a whole day to celebrate Final Fantasy XII in New York City.
635855	645680	And what's going on is that on October 12th through October 15th at the Digital Life Expo, Final Fantasy XII will be appearing at the event.
646321	646821	Very cool.
646841	650783	And I know we have a lot of fans there at New York City that want to check that out.
651164	653225	However, here's the other part you should check out.
653627	658631	October 11th is Final Fantasy XII Day, and that has been declared by New York City.
658852	661354	There will be a special commemoration in Times Square.
661954	664717	Cosplayers will be abounding, I'm sure.
666378	669901	I don't see why people are making such a big deal out of something that's such a crap game.
670141	671563	You haven't even played it yet, have you?
671603	672744	Yes, I have.
672904	673604	It's incredible.
674305	674505	The demo?
674525	675246	It's going to be incredible.
676487	676787	I know.
676887	678429	I want to play my game by myself.
679449	681111	Well, we'll just see when the full version comes out.
682766	683807	I'm still going to get it.
684047	685227	Yes, you see, fangirl.
685747	688689	I'm using Megzi's excuse.
689209	689729	Metal box.
693050	693611	Special edition.
694451	695931	Oh, special stuff.
696012	696312	All right.
698412	699093	Anyway.
701534	706896	Well, one thing that I think a lot of us will be happy about, especially a certain somebody sitting by my foot,
708610	733643	is Kingdom Hearts 2 is getting an international version in Japan we're getting Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix which a couple of us who pay attention to our live journals have seen pictures of because somebody posted a scan from a magazine of a certain somebody who was in a mask in the bonus clip for Kingdom Hearts 2 oh so this game will actually have an ending that makes sense?
735065	735945	It made sense!
736045	736646	I'm just messing.
736866	741409	But from what that picture indicated, it's going to give us more of that little clip.
741449	752377	I don't care if I'm spoiling now, but if you get the perfect ending for Kingdom Hearts 2, you get a little clip of three armored figures picking up Keyblades.
752777	754779	YouTube is amazing!
755039	759402	And there's a bajillion other Keyblades, like a graveyard, around them.
760032	789384	and apparently they're going to have more of that in the ending you know how there was the deep dive in the last Kingdom Hearts but they're also saying that they're going to be incorporating the card battle the card battle system from Chain of Memories it didn't give a lot of detail again I saw the ad for this I've seen the article they showed it like they actually showed I think the Sephiroth battle on this picture and I'll have to find out who it was on my friends list that posted the article
789961	817409	but it had the little card icons in the side and you draw your cards and play them out like Chain of Memories but it looked really neat another point is that they are getting all the English voices so hey importers be happy you too can own this game and play it in an understandable language unless you are fluent in Japanese and then you won't have a problem anyway
819005	820126	Yay, Japanese!
821366	821786	Anyways.
823387	827789	Speaking of stuff coming out in Japan, well, this is more, of course, for the U.S.
827829	831671	We have some release dates for you, including the stuff that's coming out this week.
832371	833912	And lots of good stuff, of course.
834172	836773	My favorites being on the PlayStation 2.
837113	840555	Okami is going to be finally making its way out here.
840575	842276	You know, very anticipated game.
842296	843356	It's about fucking time.
843636	844177	Exactly.
846999	849522	I will talk with my mouth full whenever I want.
849542	852364	I am one of the hosts of this podcast, goddammit.
853385	855007	Okie dokie, anyways.
855067	856928	Sorry, I was yelling at Chris for trying to be my mommy.
858390	863074	Okay, um, no, we're going to be getting some other stuff, including, uh, well,
863493	864554	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
881893	885035	OpenSeasons, pretty much on every single console, including 360.
885796	887157	Why you would buy that one, I don't know.
888498	893523	Dragon Quest Heroes Rocket Slime is going to be making its way to the DS, which is pretty awesome.
893543	907455	If you're a fan of Sierra games, there's going to be some PC compilations coming out for you, including the King's Quest compilation, Leisure Suit Larry compilation, Police Quest, Space Quest, and yeah, those will be the compilations for you.
907916	908236	Hot!
909172	912936	Samurai Warriors 2 on the 360 and PlayStation 2 are going to be coming out.
913736	924165	If you have some stuff for the 360, you're looking to pick up some games, well, The Godfather is going to be coming out for you, as well as, well, not really a game, but the Xbox Live Vision Camera, as we mentioned earlier.
926287	926868	Let's see here.
926908	931312	World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions, which is also on PSP and PlayStation 2.
932433	932573	And...
934545	937086	I'm actually, I might pick this up because it looks funny.
937366	944509	Kabbalah's Alaskan Adventure, you know, all that ice fishing and hunting polar bears on HD there.
945289	948850	And then, no Africa on ice, okay.
949390	955673	And then finally, on the Game Boy Advance, Capcom Classics, Minimix will be making its way out there.
956173	962055	And if you really buy everything for the Game Boy Advance, Fashion Dogs, where you can dress up dogs on the Game Boy Advance.
962483	964625	There are people who do that for real though, that's sad.
965485	967947	And if you're one of those people, never mind.
969068	970549	Please stop listening to OLR.
971730	975633	Oh, King of Fighters 2006, I'm sorry, was also making its way in Godfather Mob Wars.
975873	976254	Much better.
976914	984400	Well, as for our friends overseas in Europe, by the way, Suikoden V came out yesterday, so get it.
986361	989043	But on the 21st, Jaws Unleashed, yay.
989404	989664	Yay.
990120	993522	and then on the 22nd, FIFA 07 is coming out for everything.
994323	995063	And I'm not kidding.
995143	999105	It is coming out for damn near everything, including, you know, Nintendo Virtual Boy.
1000166	1000546	I'm kidding.
1002527	1003308	I have a Virtual Boy.
1006670	1008311	How can you still play your Virtual Boy?
1008391	1010992	Isn't that just the biggest migraine maker ever?
1011833	1012573	And I like it.
1013474	1015055	I still play Teleroboxer, damn it.
1015915	1016175	Freak.
1016756	1016996	Anyway.
1018202	1039259	Also coming out is Guilty Gear Dust Strikers for the DS, Jaws Unleashed on the Xbox, which I don't know why it's not coming out on the 21st with the other versions, Just Cause on Xbox 360, NHL Eastside Hockey Manager 2007 on PC, Pyroworld on PC, and Saint Seiya The Hades on PlayStation 2.
1041021	1045304	I'm glad you get it as Saint Seiya, not as like Warriors of the Zodiac, which is stupid.
1047130	1048150	Harukanaru Jikunokare Maiichiya
1062682	1063542	NHL 06, Rugby 06, Midway Arcade Treasures
1083075	1084315	Translated in Japanese.
1084395	1088337	So I guess it's a way for them to play some of the games that were really big here in America years ago.
1088677	1093338	So that's kind of neat to see a four-year-old game getting translated for a Japanese audience.
1093559	1096119	I think a lot of them were already out in Japan, though.
1096179	1098320	Well, yeah, especially in arcade format.
1098360	1103622	But some of the games, I kind of see because not all the games that were popular here were popular there and so on.
1103842	1106683	I imagine Mortal Kombat was probably bigger here than it was there.
1106723	1107783	But I don't know.
1107923	1110104	I wasn't in Japan in the mid-90s, so I don't know.
1111305	1112685	But that's what you have to look forward to this week.
1113151	1115034	Wait a minute, though!
1115074	1116295	Wait a minute, though!
1116315	1117637	Remember when they tried the 64...
1130507	1133349	When have you ever seen an SNK machine at an arcade?
1133450	1143098	I always see these SNK machines at frickin' pizza parlors, and I saw one at the supermarket and one at Jim Boy's Tacos, okay?
1143438	1145800	We had a six-slot MBS at my arcade.
1146000	1148822	Those SNK machines show up in the craziest fuckin' places.
1148922	1152085	And we had one of the big-screen TV ones for Summer Showdown 3.
1152305	1153066	I saw one in a 7-Eleven.
1153086	1156188	However, Summer Showdown 4 has a signal that resets those TVs.
1156228	1156769	It turns them off.
1157990	1158530	Anyway, anywho...
1187768	1198856	and Regulation A is actually based on the 3D home console fighting series by the same name and at least includes one new character, Ash Crimson.
1199537	1202579	Wow, Ash Crimson is such a generic sounding name.
1203299	1207963	Anyways, he's from King of Fires 03 and King of Fires 11.
1209624	1212526	Samurai Spirit Sen also play as a 3D game.
1212566	1216169	This will be the second time the sword fighting series has made its way in the arcade in 3D.
1217562	1230614	And the other one that remembers King of Fighters 64 The only good thing about that game was bringing in, what's your name that had the two swords?
1231775	1236760	Psycho Girl This is also, they announced that they're going to be releasing King of Fighters 12 on the new hardware too
1242185	1244486	Goddamn, make a new game, SNK.
1244546	1245766	Make a new fucking game.
1246146	1247927	Give us Godot Mark of the Wolves 2.
1248307	1249527	Give us Last Blade 3.
1249667	1250748	Give us a new game.
1251008	1251708	Give us a new series game.
1251728	1253068	Give us Last Blade 3, please.
1253208	1254449	Oh, God, I'm done.
1254549	1256169	Oh, my God, I love Last Blade 3.
1256530	1261311	Rob, aren't you looking forward to the Metal Slug anthology that's going to be on the Wii?
1261391	1266233	I can't wait to play Metal Slug 413, which is like the same graphics for Metal Slug 1.
1266273	1269894	I could play Metal Slug all day because it's all about... Okay, and King of Fighters 2007.
1270734	1271294	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
1271314	1271675	That wasn't SNK.
1271715	1272095	What?
1299227	1301028	That was on all the freaking machines, wasn't it?
1301249	1302769	Play more SNK now.
1302809	1303290	Whatever.
1303670	1306972	But why are they porting a shitty game like Maximum Impact?
1308393	1309994	We didn't like it here in America.
1310134	1311474	They didn't like it there in Japan.
1311915	1313075	The voiceovers suck.
1313836	1316117	Port a decent game to arcades.
1319939	1326203	Well, as far as hopefully, and I would hope with 573 titles, something good will have to be among them.
1326618	1327158	E3 probably has more.
1356445	1358407	Konami will own Tokyo Game Show.
1358567	1361250	And I'm wondering, when are we going to get WTF?
1362872	1363812	Didn't they change the name of that?
1363973	1364493	They did.
1364673	1366075	They changed it and they changed it back.
1366295	1368477	WTF is coming out in October.
1368637	1369598	Work time fun.
1369698	1370219	Good for them.
1370979	1398745	but there are actually a lot of games for PC, mobile phone games they're actually saying for PC and mobile phone they had 252 titles for portables DS will be bringing 52 PSP will have 33 18 Playstation 3 games are going to show and they'll probably all still suck and play on rack mounted servers and 20 games coming out for Xbox 360 but they're only showing 5 for the Wii Wii is holding out
1401080	1417986	The ones that they are actually going to be putting on is the Bleach game, Shiraha Kirameku Rinbu Kyoku, Marvelous Interactives, Bokujo Monogatari Wi, which is still a working title, and Elebits.
1419266	1420626	They don't say if it's going to be playable or not.
1422827	1425648	And actually, they do list a lot of the games.
1425993	1426553	T for Teen
1455075	1463707	T for Teen Crude Humor, Violence, Sexual Themes, Language, and Use of Alcohol and Tobacco
1471052	1472873	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1495495	1496556	It's been delayed forever.
1496576	1500858	And to be honest, some of the other Rockstar games, not Grand Theft Auto, have been pretty good.
1500898	1504421	I mean, Warriors was pretty fun for a while, and then I got bored with it.
1504781	1510484	But Bully looks pretty fun, and they've got a really good system for all the classes and stuff that you have to take.
1511005	1512786	A lot of minigames and stuff involved with that.
1512826	1514567	So I think it'll be pretty good if you give it a chance.
1516228	1516528	I don't know.
1516628	1518249	You just have to wait until it comes out, I guess.
1518589	1521291	ActDeft in our chatroom says, Jack Thompson will sue.
1521971	1524533	Jack Thompson's stupid, and it doesn't have anything to do with, you know,
1525209	1528190	Great, so he's going to complain about this game.
1528410	1530270	Play the damn game, you'll see that there's nothing.
1530930	1535311	I don't even think it has much to do with bullying people, to be honest, if you actually play the game.
1535871	1541952	OLArmyEddy says, sexual themes, usually that's an automatic M. Not necessarily.
1542312	1546413	It could just be a chick dancing in her bra or something.
1546433	1548473	That might not be M, but it might be a little bit, you know.
1549733	1554014	Not to bring this up again, but they have sexual themes in The Sims 2, and that's rated T.
1555370	1556290	Yeah, it has woohoo.
1556330	1559012	Especially if you get the special furniture with the sex animations.
1559032	1562013	Yeah, woohoo in, I think, on the couch.
1562093	1564874	Woohoo in the bed, woohoo in the hot tub, and then something else.
1566715	1567535	Woohoo indeed.
1568095	1571237	Nintendo should have come out with a system called the woohoo.
1571377	1578239	The old Sims, the first Sims game actually had someone programmed a countertop that you could... Woohoo on.
1578259	1579180	With full animations.
1579960	1580240	Wow.
1580480	1581241	Okay, woohoo indeed.
1581261	1582441	But hey, online content may change.
1582981	1583301	Anyways.
1584242	1584402	So...
1586524	1601093	Speaking about, you know, some stuff that people think that games like Bully Cause, well, there was a shooter in Montreal that went and killed a bunch of people in his school, and guess what they found as one of his favorite games?
1601133	1608437	Apparently this guy plays a lot of games, including one that happens to be Super Columbine Massacre RPG.
1608877	1613700	You know, not the sequel to Super Mario RPG, just to clear that up for you.
1614801	1615841	Thanks, I wasn't sure.
1639045	1640406	Did you see the videos of him on CNN?
1663038	1665861	A real gamer would have been that crazy.
1666201	1667242	He was nuts.
1667302	1669344	But it's all the game's fault.
1669424	1671045	It's all about the game.
1671105	1672727	What did the game do to him?
1672747	1675609	I blame his psychosis and his parents for not being more observant.
1675930	1677911	I don't think it was his favorite game, but you know what?
1677951	1684617	When you see that, of course, if you're going to be trying to spin this in the news, that's going to get the most attention.
1684758	1686659	So let's, of course, blame it on the games.
1686859	1688401	Naturally, lots of feedback from our viewers.
1688959	1689199	Yeah.
1689359	1691321	Chat room over at orangeentrainer.com.
1691381	1691921	Click on chat.
1691981	1696325	OL Army Eddie says, Super Columbine RPG does not glorify school shootings at all.
1697846	1698286	Let's see.
1698967	1699927	I always butcher this name.
1699947	1700428	Jamie, help me.
1700508	1701569	Nazgul Slayer?
1701589	1702049	Nazgul?
1702269	1702810	Nazgul.
1703050	1703330	Damn it.
1703350	1705151	That one fucks me up.
1706132	1711096	Nazgul Slayer says, he used RPG Maker 2000 to make Super Columbine Massacre.
1711136	1712117	I read an article about it.
1712397	1714739	So it's not really Super Columbine Massacre that's the problem.
1715019	1717741	It's RPG Maker, the devil's game.
1718940	1719800	No, no, no.
1719820	1721421	I'm attacking the darkness.
1722761	1724201	I'm using magic missiles.
1724261	1725481	Do you have any Mountain Dew?
1725621	1729462	Socorino would like to point out, also, his gun was legal, but his clips weren't.
1731242	1732003	Hmm, interesting.
1732623	1733083	You know what?
1735283	1744985	This is, it just further illustrates that society is more ready to look for a scapegoat than actually treat the true root of the problem.
1745697	1747518	Do these kind of stories make you angry, DarkSakura?
1747758	1748919	They make me furious.
1749219	1749999	Livid.
1750039	1751060	Ludicrously livid.
1751100	1752580	Do they make you want to rant a little bit?
1752821	1754782	They make me want to go to a school and shoot people.
1755062	1763606	Well, it wouldn't be episode... It wouldn't be episode 200 of a podcast without... The Fuse of the Week.
1763626	1764346	My, uh...
1776133	1805539	FU of the week I can't believe I completely blamed I had what my FU was going to be and it wasn't related to traffic at all wow my FU of the week goes toward the Japantown Anime Festival oh my god crappiest convention ever well to you know in their defense they were pretty small I mean but still hey that's not nice talking about the Japanese being small okay
1806303	1808184	This was my... You're Pokemon!
1808204	1809205	You connect all to Pokemon!
1809225	1810225	No, that's not nice.
1810325	1811145	I understand.
1811946	1816408	My problem with it being is that... No, this is in San Francisco, by the way.
1817129	1825533	My problem with it was that it suffered the same problem that AX started to suffer as in being spread across different areas.
1825953	1834557	You had to do... You had to go from one mall to the other, into the hotel, into the courtyard downstairs under Kinozumiya at Kintetsu Mall.
1835418	1835578	But...
1836400	1838702	They had a pretty good band that we were there for listening to the warm-up.
1838722	1839663	They actually sounded pretty cool.
1839683	1842265	But the dealer's room, it was a dealer's closet.
1842585	1843245	The closet!
1844746	1846768	And they had some interesting stuff, some nice stuff.
1846868	1851772	But, you know, overall it was pretty much what you could find online pretty easily.
1851792	1854514	But what I was most disappointed with was the cosplay.
1855915	1860819	I expected to go and see people taking advantage of the opportunity to cosplay.
1860839	1862180	There was a pretty big Naruto group.
1862220	1863361	There was a pretty big Bleach group.
1865206	1866267	It's been done.
1866848	1868269	It's been done, yeah.
1868689	1870150	I could go see that at any other convention.
1870170	1871371	We did meet lots of nice people.
1871832	1876555	We met some people on DA, on DeviantArt, who were really cool.
1877136	1884402	But overall, I think I had a higher expectation for it just because of how it was played up there, having all this different stuff go on.
1884942	1888805	And it really was just blah.
1890266	1893489	The only advantage of it is that our badges gave us discounts at the stores.
1894448	1895268	So I could buy porn.
1895909	1896389	Porn.
1897630	1898831	I bought some Yelly.
1900471	1901472	Um, Loki.
1902433	1903153	Your FU's of the week.
1903913	1905174	Mine don't have to do with porn.
1906235	1907475	FU to Wicker Man.
1907716	1908316	That movie.
1909076	1911638	Why did they have to kill Nicolas Cage's character off?
1911678	1913159	I mean, it was getting good.
1913499	1918542	Like, the whole movie was kind of like, eh, okay, this whole island with... Wow, thanks for saving me ten bucks!
1920128	1922109	And isn't that how the original ended?
1922330	1923670	Yes, but I'll get to that.
1923810	1925111	Okay, so here's the thing.
1925571	1927052	Why did they have to kill his character off?
1927112	1927993	It started getting good.
1928033	1930194	I mean, he punched a woman in the face.
1930554	1932455	I was like, god damn, this movie's gonna be awesome.
1932495	1935457	Then, fucking, oh god, I can't remember her name.
1935477	1936938	The chick from...
1937578	1938158	The Burning Man?
1967051	1972653	Yeah, this whole, the whole movie reminded me of Burning Man, like, in Seattle or something, you know, it's like, alright.
1973393	1979915	Um, my FU of the week goes to my iPod, which upon boot up today gave me a frowny face of death.
1980896	1993480	I blame iTunes 7, because ever since I installed iTunes 7, that thing started acting weird, like, iTunes did not want to talk to my old-ass, you know, fourth-gen iPod or whatever it is, the black and white before they were color iPods, so...
1994219	1998340	FU iTunes 7 for ruining my iPod and now I can't listen to podcasts in my car.
1998420	2006902	So, no Bobby, no All Games, no other podcasts I listen to or OLR in my car for a while until I can afford the video iPod.
2008062	2009503	So, FU frowny face of death.
2010663	2011383	I blame Apple.
2011923	2013804	Loki, just bite your tongue.
2014384	2016425	Chris, how about... I blame the lack of Rockbox.
2016485	2018565	How about your... Oh, okay, Drew Nami, your FUs of the week.
2018725	2022266	Alright, first off, FU to Missing Class for an entire week.
2022915	2024716	Thanks for the thought, but tried it.
2053894	2059837	Okay, for lack of anything better, my FU of the week is to my bed at home.
2060798	2064800	It, for some reason, thinks that I need to be molested in the middle of the night.
2066721	2067801	What kind of bed is this?
2067861	2068662	I want to buy one.
2069802	2070783	IKEA, actually.
2071103	2071763	Alright!
2071823	2075045	Okay, there is only one bed... God, I love Sweden.
2078160	2081422	Okay, I never let any of my friends... Abba and molesting beds.
2081482	2082703	It doesn't get much better than that.
2082863	2084224	Do you want to hear my story or not?
2084244	2086665	Sorry.
2087045	2094129	Okay, there's only one other bed that's available in my house when my friends come over, and that's the one my dad and his girlfriend use, so they have to sleep in my bed.
2095090	2098932	And twice I've woken up to my friends trying to molest me.
2099632	2103375	Jamie slept in there last night, and she was all trying to pet my chest.
2106196	2107317	Okay, I was having a dream.
2110160	2111721	This show just got a lot hotter.
2113542	2118204	I was having a dream about a couple of characters, and they were just sleeping in the bed.
2118224	2118904	There was a cat there.
2118924	2121425	And this is what Shermie does.
2121985	2125287	She'll crawl in the bed between me and Dan, and I'll reach over and pet her.
2126007	2134951	So in the dream, I guess the character there in my dream was reaching over to pet the cat, and I opened my eyes to see my hand hovering over Kristen's chest.
2135511	2136632	I was like, oh, you're not a cat.
2138078	2140619	That was Marissa's reaction, except she said, oh, you don't have a penis.
2143540	2150843	She thought my friend Marissa came down a few weekends ago and she thought I was her boyfriend, Christopher, and was all rubbing my back.
2151083	2154404	And she's like, oh, wait, you don't have a penis, and turned over and fell asleep.
2155205	2156645	So people want to molest me in my bed.
2157446	2158526	Dot, dot, dot.
2158646	2163368	And to respond to Jeremy Todd, I have had a hot lesbian dream about Angelina Jolie.
2163508	2163768	Thank you.
2165080	2168401	I think I've had a hot lesbian dream about Angelina Jolie, actually.
2169181	2170821	Who hasn't had a hot lesbian dream about her?
2170901	2173402	I'm not kidding either, and I also had one about Billy Piper.
2173662	2174262	Alright, anyway.
2177082	2178603	The one who played Rose in Doctor Who.
2179583	2180183	She's pretty!
2182343	2183743	We've lost control here on episode 200.
2184764	2189425	Anyway, we had a story earlier in the program about Final Fantasy XII and Final Fantasy XII Day.
2189485	2192045	Well, maybe there'll be two Final Fantasy XII Days, because guess what?
2192534	2196355	Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings
2223188	2228090	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2250256	2253497	This one is a very special one, especially for episode 200.
2254117	2261220	The website of the week is OrangeLoungeRadio.com You must go to our site every day, hang out on our forums.
2261700	2262421	We are awesome.

2268403	2269783	And you get to talk to us!
2270804	2271724	Because it's special.
2272304	2276346	And you know, I figured it's about damn time that I plug our own damn site.
2276806	2279667	So OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the site of the week.
2280754	2282534	Not to forget... Shameless self-promotion!
2282554	2283275	Damn right!
2283635	2285575	Not to forget OLR PSP.
2286155	2286916	OLR PSP.
2287096	2289196	And you can go to E3 on PSP.
2289216	2290517	Yeah, E3 on PSP.
2290577	2294698	Yeah, very, very, very... It's about as updated as the OLR on PSP.
2294978	2298679	If you want to see something that hasn't been updated in like five years, there's DarkSakura.com.
2301019	2303440	Seriously, haven't updated it in five years.
2305100	2305561	Alright.
2306721	2307221	Good job!
2307546	2310487	And we have our blogs at stuff.orangenounsradio.com Oh, fuck.
2310507	2311747	Those blogs haven't been updated in like a year.
2311827	2313067	I was going to update mine.
2313087	2313587	Well, alright.
2313787	2314127	We better.
2314507	2314968	Get on that.
2315108	2315328	Okay.
2315468	2318268	And there's my Jack Thompson is a bully rant on there.
2318288	2320229	There's some good reads on there if you haven't seen it yet.
2321029	2322389	Anyways.
2322509	2332751	What's kind of interesting and very disappointing to me is that it was announced this week that the PS3 controller will not be named Poos.
2333051	2337232	It will be named Sixaxis or Syaxis or whatever it's
2337762	2345585	Basically comes from the fact that the controller has six different axes of motion sensing.
2346386	2350848	And yeah, since it doesn't rumble, I guess they can't really call it DualShock now, can they?
2351008	2354930	So six axes is the name of the controller.
2355630	2356230	Hooray.
2356250	2359031	It's also a palindrome.
2359532	2360792	How do we find this out for sure?
2360872	2362533	How do we know for sure that this is the name of it?
2362733	2367235	Well, actually, this was from a patent.
2367998	2375919	or I should say a trademark that was registered and it's been pulled up and it's owned by Sony, so hurrah.
2376339	2378160	What if they're just trying a couple things out?
2378980	2396243	It's true, you know, I don't know if it's for sure, but you know what, they've been, it's also been, you know, mentioned 6-axis and a few different PR things, not as, you know, it might be like the system, you know, the name for the system of the motion sensing, like for example, it says the
2396824	2411238	The controller for the PS3 employs breakthrough technology of high precision, highly sensitive 6-axis sensing system that does not require any devices other than the controller itself for seamless interactive operation.
2411618	2415802	So that might be just the technology they're calling it 6-axis.
2417304	2417704	Interesting.
2418729	2425693	Alright, well, every week you guys write us letters, and we read them right here on Orange Lounge Radio's podcast.
2425933	2434458	If you want to send us an email, it's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and when you send your email, DarkSakura suits up in her biohazard suit and puts on her rubber gloves.
2436589	2438791	I have a hazmat suit and asbestos gloves.
2462716	2463697	All you guys suck.
2463777	2464737	Rob is not sexy.
2464777	2465578	Loki is stupid.
2465858	2467099	Jamie is a mean bitch.
2467539	2470861	Your show is full of lesbians and 30-year-old children who live in their parents' cellar.
2471221	2471781	Die!
2472501	2473502	Is that good enough hate mail?
2474543	2475363	No, you know I love you guys.
2475383	2475603	Happy 200.
2476183	2478865	Chris, isn't your online name DisneyButtPunk10?
2479325	2480005	DisneyButt?
2480025	2483747	That's what I'm going to start calling you after that email.
2484248	2484968	Why, yes!
2485348	2488210	As a matter of fact, DisneyPunk10 is my handle.
2488910	2490291	That's an awful coincidence!
2491411	2492532	Well, thanks for the hate mail.
2492592	2494834	We love getting hate mail at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
2495795	2496075	Bitch.
2496415	2499278	Nah, she brings me cake.
2499378	2499818	I love her.
2500138	2500699	And donuts.
2500859	2501800	And crowns.
2502981	2503561	And crowns.
2504322	2504542	Yep.
2505703	2510788	I'm going to go parade in the living room right now while Jamie reads the next email and listen for the laughter.
2512649	2515752	You look like such a lovely princess, Rob.
2517153	2517694	And anyway...
2519031	2528595	Our next email comes from Robert M. Now that Apple has announced that you can purchase games for the iPod, what do you see becoming of this form of mobile gaming?
2529256	2536919	I may pick up Bejeweled just to see, but later it'll be interesting to see how the Units Limited controller, basically like an Atari 2600 paddle controller...
2537634	2540955	I really wonder even seeing the preview of how Pac-Man is controlled is used.
2541455	2545997	I can imagine a great version of Gyruss, for instance.
2546437	2548918	Also, how does this open up the possibility of homebrewed games?
2549459	2556661	It's easy to make your own music and movies and play them on the iPod without ever starting an account to buy them, but what about those with skill and patience to program full games?
2557462	2558862	I thought they already had homebrewed games.
2559702	2560703	Like they had Doom on there.
2561323	2562363	For what reason, I don't know.
2564184	2565925	They said hail to the queen when I walked out there.
2567677	2568017	Bitches.
2570258	2574098	I think since they've already got it, then... Sorry, I missed the reading of the email.
2574118	2575179	Was this about the iPod games?
2575279	2575439	Yeah.
2575559	2576799	Okay, because I dug in there earlier in the week.
2578219	2580140	I thought I saw some gay in there.
2581660	2581820	No.
2582560	2582920	I don't know.
2583380	2586081	The problem with gaming on the iPod is that frickin' wheel.
2587041	2588741	You know, that's not the best controller in the world.
2588781	2593322	You know what would be great, though, is that, you know that little thing that you plug your USB thing into in the bottom?
2593602	2597143	Wouldn't that be an awesome place to just jam a controller into, and then there you go.
2598410	2599350	That's what Apple should do.
2599390	2600211	Apple will make more money.
2600591	2601771	I think that would be a smart idea.
2602211	2605252	If Apple wanted to get into gaming on the iPod, that would be a great addition.
2605633	2606253	But what do I know?
2606293	2607353	I'm just some show on the Internet.
2608273	2615136	Well, our next email says, Dear OLR crew, I would like to say thank you for the past 1.5 years of entertainment.
2615576	2620478	I went into the gigantic list of gaming podcasts and my first random pick happened to be this wonderful podcast.
2620898	2622578	I've been listening ever since and it's been fun.
2622619	2623819	The hosts and guest hosts are great.
2624835	2634918	Also, this podcast introduced some of the coolest bands, Gorillaz, Freeze Pop, Games, Guitar Hero, Katamari, Websites, Gorillaz, and Official DeviantArt, and Survival Tips.
2635218	2636398	I now know how to stop a camel.
2637138	2640319	So thanks for being a part of all your listeners' life.
2640419	2642520	Reject false icons, Ion671.
2642660	2643000	P.S.
2643040	2644000	Come to the East Coast sometime.
2644280	2645001	That was sweet.
2645081	2647821	And I'm coming to New York City end of October.
2648141	2650522	And I'm going to be going to the Nintendo World Store to meet fans.
2650742	2651582	So I don't know what day that is.
2651602	2653563	I would like to go, but I'm going to YaoiCon.
2654540	2654780	Hot.
2655581	2658343	That was a sweet email, thank you.
2658463	2666688	Someone who remembers me reading the... For anyone who wants to know where I got my survival tips from, it's the Worst Case Scenario Survival Handbook.
2666728	2669730	Whoa, sorry, we had a snafu there.
2669750	2671492	Neverending stories started playing in the background there.
2671512	2671912	Sorry, guys.
2672212	2674274	The neverending soda.
2674334	2675034	My bad.
2678396	2680798	Next up is Warrior Bob.
2681278	2682039	That's such a cool name.
2682950	2683950	That's what it is.
2683990	2684110	Never!
2684130	2684230	Never!
2712369	2715292	But it may be a good way to get some exposure to the non-podcast audience.
2717134	2721098	Reading that again to myself, I suppose lesbian pillow fights may have a similar effect.
2721198	2722860	Yeah, I didn't mean to bring that in.
2723060	2724101	That was an accident.
2725382	2725843	No, it's fine.
2725923	2726183	It's fine.
2727149	2730871	Regardless, were it feasible, I'd definitely attend a traveling OLR show.
2731351	2734892	I had to miss the Fanime panel last spring, so I'd love to have that sort of thing happen again.
2735133	2736633	We will, by the way, be at Fanime next year.
2736853	2741015	Fanime next year, and it looks like SakuraCon is also for Seattle people.
2741115	2741695	We're going to be there.
2742656	2745937	And possibly, at least myself, will be at one East Coast con.
2745977	2748418	So we're going to be doing anime cons up the butt next year.
2748458	2750759	I want to try to get to OdaCon next year, but I can't.
2751039	2751780	We'll see.
2752380	2753561	But more on this.
2754281	2754481	Huh?
2755819	2756880	I'm going to ASUN next year.
2757360	2760022	And Megzi, so we can try something.
2760522	2761303	Flyer, girls!
2761363	2763664	We can walk around with a shirt or something stupid like that.
2765325	2767086	Afterwards, we'll drink Guinness and play old games.
2767166	2767767	It'll be a party.
2767947	2768507	I love Guinness.
2768527	2769087	That is hot.
2769128	2770428	That is my idea of a party.
2770548	2773350	Looking forward to your show hitting the podcast stream, so I'll hear you then.
2773410	2774091	Have a great night.
2774291	2775692	And relatedly, fuck Pyrite.
2777153	2777593	Amen!
2779005	2781286	That is a card-carrying OL Army member.
2781466	2782966	For a second there, I thought you said pyrite.
2782986	2784607	I'm like, damn that fool's gold.
2784767	2785187	Damn it.
2787587	2790868	Pyrite is cool because it crystallizes in cube form.
2792789	2793729	I took chemistry.
2793809	2794209	Hello.
2795930	2797430	Science and technology.
2798271	2798531	Anyway.
2799011	2799631	Science.
2800171	2802632	We should ban dihydrogen monoxide.
2803352	2806473	Yeah, you know that dihydrogen monoxide is just water.
2807653	2808474	I know.
2808494	2809074	Wasn't that on an episode?
2809094	2810114	Penn and Teller's bullshit.
2810334	2813796	Dude, one of my friends was just telling me about that episode.
2813856	2815056	Anyway, next email.
2815216	2815496	Okay.
2815616	2816357	Hey, OLR.
2816397	2819958	Just wanted to congratulate you on your 200th episode since I won't be listening live tonight.
2820018	2820538	Have a good one.
2820618	2821919	And that's from Mike.
2822379	2822659	Thank you.
2822679	2824560	Okay.
2824960	2825740	Next one up.
2826080	2826821	Ooh, long one.
2827141	2827901	Not long, long, but.
2828410	2833832	This is actually from Kenji, who I posted his email as my email of the month.
2834072	2835312	Oh, this is our essay writer.
2835553	2841275	I'm going to start doing an email of the month, by the way, so make sure you start sending in very thoughtful and well-written things that don't have hate in them.
2843195	2844956	Happy 200th episode, OLR.
2845016	2848837	Congratulations on making it this far, and here's hoping for your continued successes and good fortune.
2849177	2849517	Cheers.
2849958	2850618	This won't be long.
2850658	2855039	I figure that everything I'll mention in this letter will already be mentioned before you even touch this week's mailbag.
2855399	2856800	They blew it, blew it, blew it, blew it.
2857372	2859975	Nintendo couldn't have been set up any better.
2859995	2861878	$600 PS3 on November 17th.
2862298	2863780	Can Kutaragi stick up his ass?
2864241	2865783	Microsoft with a dollar sign.
2866544	2868947	Problem with selling 360s in every other market in the US.
2868987	2870649	The cars were all laid out in Nintendo's favor.
2871010	2875035	All Reggie had to say was $199, October something or the other, and get off the stage.
2875315	2875776	But they didn't.
2876260	2877001	Thank you for watching!
2894998	2898241	Also, does anyone else see the Pictochat-like qualities in the Wii channels?
2898842	2900563	Hell, it might just be the system alone.
2900943	2910212	Just as Pictochat sold DS systems in Japan without selling any accompanying software, Photo Channel and the Mii Channel especially seem to be those quirky things that'll keep non-gamers entertained for hours.
2910292	2916817	Then they have the Wii Forums, where you can post stuff with your caricature as your little avatar.
2916917	2918599	Yeah, but that's specific to your Wii, right?
2918639	2920000	That's not Internet Wii.
2920120	2920641	I'm not sure.
2920701	2921842	I think it was your own Wii.
2922406	2924427	It was like for family members to leave messages to each other.
2924728	2925568	Hi, Mom, you suck.
2925588	2926429	Stop playing.
2927390	2928250	Dad's a whore.
2929891	2931793	For a good time, call Mom.
2932913	2934895	Last night, ooh!
2935895	2940639	And it said, Mad, just my opinions from a slightly educated gamer.
2941279	2948084	But if you haven't answered this already, will the higher, near next-gen price point keep you guys from getting a Wii?
2948304	2949345	Thanks and congrats again, Kenji.
2950649	2959631	Well, didn't he say, I mean, I think this guy's great and all because he has a lot to say, but didn't he just say, you know, Nintendo fucked up, and then he said, but it sounds kind of neat.
2960632	2970454	I think what the intention was is that Nintendo could have gotten a whole lot more in the terms of new people buying the system had it just been dropped a little bit more, had a few more pack-ins.
2970614	2972315	It's not doom and gloom.
2972375	2973335	It's still the cheapest.
2973935	2974055	I'm...
2974702	2976324	It's still the cheapest one on the shelf.
2976344	2977125	It's Sunshine and Rainbows.
2977225	2980610	It's not only the cheapest one on the shelf, but it's the cheapest one on the shelf with the game.
2981211	2985116	And you can buy that in a 360 and still not pay as much as you would for... Wii 60.
2985436	2989101	I'm pre-ordering one in both GameStop and my work, so I may have two.
2996434	2998856	I'm not allowed to talk about how I'm getting a Wii, but I am getting a Wii.
2999156	3000277	And I will have it on release day.
3001678	3003720	Well, we'll have ours on release day.
3004060	3005141	We all will because we're special.
3005981	3008904	Anyway, the last email tonight comes from Alessa.
3009684	3010185	Cool.
3010925	3012066	Dude, like Silent Hill?
3013007	3014428	I don't know if I'm excited about that.
3014508	3014969	No, I'm kidding.
3015029	3020153	It's actually a link to an article about a father that killed his child over a video game.
3022001	3022542	Oh no.
3024484	3026165	What's he playing World of Warcraft?
3042760	3056146	Reading further in the article, apparently just being a cute little kid, she was pulling on the controller cord, playing with it, and the system fell, and he apparently was so upset he punched her in the face twice.
3057826	3062708	When the mother came in to ask, because she was taking a nap, she didn't know anything was happening.
3063389	3071752	When she got up to check on her daughter, she asked why she's not breathing, and he said she's breathing, she's just asleep or something like that, but
3072402	3078044	She called the ambulance and she was pronounced dead at the scene.
3079144	3090687	Apparently this guy was supposed to be, they said that he was a fairly non-violent person, but I think, first of all, I think the game has nothing to do with it.
3091188	3094549	What if he had been building a house of cards and she knocked it over?
3096866	3103507	If he's given to punch somebody over something, especially a child, over something so trivial, he would have done it over anything.
3103527	3105607	There's some type of violent gene there.
3105788	3108808	That definitely has nothing to do with a video game.
3109168	3111769	That is one seriously mentally fucked up person.
3112029	3116109	On a completely unrelated note, five bucks says it was Madden.
3116489	3118130	I kid, I kid, I kid.
3119510	3124511	No, it was Baby Tossing 2000, you know, on the Xbox 360 arcade, apparently.
3124531	3125991	It actually doesn't say what game it was from.
3126031	3126171	Yeah.
3127042	3135167	Nintendog Sniper 2006 The sad thing is that the lady was pregnant with another baby.
3136568	3138810	The good news is he'll be the hell away from that one.
3138970	3140411	Yeah, he is locked up.
3140751	3145374	They're actually charging him with murder, endangering the welfare of a child, and possession of an instrument of crime.
3147175	3152678	But the thing that struck me is that the lady was saying that her daughter is never going to meet her big sister.
3152698	3155000	And that was what got me on that.
3155788	3179889	GS68 in our chatroom says I'll say it now shut up Jack seriously you know he's gonna hop on that shit but again I don't think it was what he was doing so much you know if she had toppled over something else he might have been working on if he was that mentally unstable to strike a child you know then he would have done it over anything
3183363	3186085	Well, I'm not sure how to transition to this story.
3186665	3191528	I suppose I could say something about at least he didn't throw the Guitar Hero controller.
3191668	3192028	I don't know.
3192568	3194129	But this is a story on Guitar Hero 2.
3194949	3196430	New songs announced for the game.
3197011	3202153	Mega Death with Hanger 18 is supposedly going to be like the last final boss song in the game.
3202494	3203174	That'll be pretty rad.
3203534	3205375	Aerosmith with Last Child.
3205855	3208517	And this song I think is pretty cool coming to Guitar Hero 2.
3208997	3210398	Cheap Trick with Surrender.
3211434	3212654	That's going to be kind of fun.
3212934	3213394	I like that.
3213834	3216255	They've already announced the one song I was most interested in, though.
3216315	3217115	What, the Spinal Tap?
3217255	3217855	No, YYZ.
3218175	3218275	Oh.
3219215	3220376	Aren't you a big fan of the Spinal Tap?
3220396	3221056	I love Rush.
3221256	3221656	Alright.
3222116	3222596	Rush is cool.
3223156	3227717	Anyways, I'm glad to see that Guitar Hero 2 seems to be on its way to being finished.
3228217	3233618	There's another game which supposedly is going to be finished pretty soon.
3234278	3238179	Duke Nukem Forever is apparently in the polished stage.
3238659	3240059	I don't know what the fuck does that mean.
3240751	3241892	The polish stage.
3242052	3246776	It means that the physics and animation systems are virtually finished and shippable.
3247176	3249798	It's simply maintenance and polish from here on out.
3249979	3254923	We haven't needed to make substantial changes to those systems in months.
3255303	3257425	I think they mean polish as in polishing a turd.
3258025	3260647	The changes have been made... Sorry the game's delayed.
3260707	3266212	We've all been too busy polishing our poles.
3266232	3268093	It says... And then he goes on to say...
3269349	3270750	I worked for Prey Drew said it worked for Prey
3295024	3296105	Pray, I don't think so.
3296565	3298285	It wasn't that great of a game.
3298365	3299006	Pray's kind of fun.
3299046	3304168	It was kind of fun, but kind of fun isn't like, wow, ten years in the making.
3305248	3309330	Well, we'll see how the free expansion pack is that's supposedly coming.
3311191	3318274	Well, you know how we're always bringing up some of our more quirky games?
3318394	3321435	Well, Majesco is bringing Cake Mania to the DS.
3323328	3324068	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
3346317	3352580	We'll bring in the touchscreen part so you can bake your cakes with extra touch power, I guess.
3353941	3358163	But it will be the full game plus the Back to the Bakery expansion pack.
3359363	3363786	So if anyone's into the weirdo quirk stuff, it will be coming out for $20.
3363826	3368508	Developed by Digital Embryo, which I think is a cool name.
3369769	3372210	Another series that Majesco is going to be bringing out.
3372430	3374431	They have two titles in development for the Wii series.
3374901	3375201	Bust-a-Move
3403444	3406807	I was wondering if it was maybe the Cake Mania thing came out later or something, but I guess not.
3406827	3408529	There's ones for the DS and ones for the Wii.
3408849	3411231	So we should have more information pretty soon.
3412993	3416816	Anyway, that's going to bring to an end this Part B of our podcast.
3417356	3419538	I know you guys are thinking, wait a minute, you haven't taken calls yet.
3419598	3420920	You haven't done last minute stories yet.
3421460	3426585	Well, tonight, guys, for our very special episode number 200, we're going to be doing a Part C.
