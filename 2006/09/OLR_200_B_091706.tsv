0	6000	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
6000	15000	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15000	20000	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20000	26000	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on this lovely Sunday evening, September the 17th of 2006.
26000	30000	It is our 200th episode tonight, so it's a little bit crazy, but that's alright.
30000	33000	What else can we do here to celebrate of our 200th episode?
33000	35000	We have a little cake during the break.
35000	37000	Thank you, Chris, for bringing the chocolate cake.
37000	40000	I'm filled with chocolatey goodness now. It's great.
40000	42000	But we're going to get back into what we do well here.
42000	44000	It is some gaming news.
44000	45000	Loki, start us off.
45000	52000	Yes, and as we talked about in Part A about the Wii being region-free or not being region-free, we still don't know.
52000	58000	There is rumors that the PlayStation 3 may be region-free, and there might be confirmation on that.
58000	66000	According to a Resistance Fall of Man video interview posted on GameVideos, the PlayStation 3 may indeed be region-free.
66000	75000	And basically the kind of proof for that is that they're talking about multiple versions of the game,
75000	82000	all the videos being put in there in both the high-def formats, including PAL, on one disc.
82000	90000	So people are kind of assuming, okay, so there's going to be one run of the game that's going to be throughout the world.
90000	95000	So maybe kind of some proof that there might be some region-free games.
95000	100000	I think, if anything, it's going to be like the 360, whereas some games are region-free.
100000	103000	If the developers want them, some games aren't.
103000	106000	I think that's probably what you're going to see.
106000	110000	Interesting. I don't know. I would hope that the PS3 would be region-free,
110000	114000	but that would be kind of a new thing for Sony, because PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 1 definitely weren't.
114000	117000	But PlayStation 1 was pretty easy to get around it.
117000	120000	PlayStation 2 took a little while, but now you can get around it.
120000	124000	But I have a Japanese PlayStation 2 just because I had to have those imports,
124000	127000	and I did not want to fuck up my original PlayStation 2.
127000	130000	I have a first-model JPS2. It still works, actually.
130000	133000	But there's no way I'm getting a JPS3. Too much money.
133000	137000	I'll just have to wait. Forget the imports. I'll just have to live without it.
137000	143000	Anyway, another thing people have been curious about PlayStation 3 is what is really their answer to Xbox Live.
143000	146000	One interesting piece of speculation came up this week.
146000	151000	XFire, a possible team-up with the popular PC messaging program XFire.
151000	155000	I'm an XFire user, and I think it's awesome, because I could be playing World of Warcraft
155000	159000	and message somebody who's playing Call of Duty or something else a completely different game.
159000	162000	I think the concept behind XFire is awesome.
162000	166000	Even if MTV does own it, it doesn't matter. I think it's a great system.
166000	168000	I would be very excited to see something like this come to PlayStation 3.
168000	170000	There was a quote this week.
170000	174000	I believe it was 1UP reporting from a transcript of Viacom's report.
174000	180000	Quote, importantly, XFire just signed a deal with Sony to create a version of their platform for the new PlayStation 3,
180000	186000	which will now enable XFire to extend its reach further into the huge console gaming market.
186000	191000	And they're saying that Untold Legends Dark Kingdom, which was a PS3 launch exclusive,
191000	195000	was in XFire's PC initialization file.
195000	199000	Now, after this story sat on the Internet for a couple days before you folks in the chat room start yelling at us
199000	201000	and telling us, you know, wait a minute, wait a minute.
201000	204000	Yes, we do know little news came out a little later that says,
204000	208000	actually, Sony doesn't plan to be fully integrating XFire right here.
208000	211000	This was just for this one game.
211000	214000	But you know what? I still find this partnership to be very interesting nonetheless.
214000	217000	What do you guys think? I mean, Loki, you know a lot about XFire. Do you use it at all?
217000	218000	Nope.
218000	222000	Oh, well then, what do you think about teaming up with the PC based?
222000	229000	Well, might as well, since Sony doesn't seem to know what the, you know, their ass from their foot as far as online, you know, services go.
229000	232000	Well, how do you know they don't have something already and they just haven't said anything yet?
232000	238000	Because their whole answer is like, yes, our services will be exactly what Xbox Live is.
238000	241000	So, you know, since they can't really innovate on that, I guess.
241000	250000	I don't know. They haven't really said anything about it and the fact that there's a lack of information about what they're providing on their online service makes me think, hmm,
250000	253000	they don't know what they're providing on their online service yet.
253000	256000	They don't have a plan whatsoever.
256000	263000	So I'm sure, you know, we're going to hear more about their online service and about their games at Tokyo Game Show in a few weeks.
263000	269000	But until then, I don't think they know shit about their online service right now.
269000	271000	And I think it's just kind of pieced together.
271000	275000	And I think you just said what exactly is going to prove your statement wrong, Tokyo Game Show.
275000	277000	I think our answers are, we're going to get the answers to our questions there.
277000	285000	Well, until then, I still think that they, their online services very pieced together and I don't know.
285000	287000	It doesn't sound very good so far.
287000	288000	Jamie, any thoughts from you?
288000	291000	I know you don't really do a lot of PC gaming, but...
291000	294000	I have AIM.
294000	296000	Well, X-Fire's kind of like it in a way.
296000	298000	I have AIM.
298000	303000	What if PlayStation 3 had AIM on it? Would that be cool?
303000	307000	I probably wouldn't use it on there because I'd be too busy playing a game.
307000	308000	Ooh.
308000	310000	All right. Good thought, I guess.
310000	312000	Anyways, yeah.
312000	319000	So, speaking of the PlayStation 3, we know that they're, of course, coming out with two different versions of the PlayStation 3,
319000	325000	a premium and I guess a core version, you know, if you want to use the Xbox 360 analogy.
325000	337000	The rumored ratio of these is supposed to be 80% of the premium, 20% core because, you know, they really want to push that, you know, $600 model.
337000	341000	So, you're going to be seeing most of these coming out, you know, in the more expensive bundle,
341000	344000	but I think a lot of people are going to be getting the more expensive one anyway.
344000	351000	It's kind of like how with the Xbox 360, sure, they had the core one available, but people only bought it because the premium was sold out.
351000	358000	So, I guess that's their way of making more money off of this or losing less money, I guess.
358000	364000	Well, I was kind of bitter when the only Xbox 360 I could get was a core because they were making, like, it seemed like half and half.
364000	369000	So, I think they know the more people want the premiums because the cores are kind of a joke, just like they were a 360 in my opinion.
369000	376000	And to be honest, there's going to be shortages because they're only going to have, you know, what, 400,000 units to launch with the United States or North America.
376000	380000	Well, I ain't buying one until at least 2007, so there you go.
380000	386000	You know what, at least with the Wii, you know, they're promising 4 million units by the end of the year, most of which are coming to the United States.
386000	393000	Well, I hope they make good on that or else, you know, it better not be the 360 all over again. So, we'll see.
393000	403000	Well, in other news, this actually has to do with the Xbox 360 and some UK news.
403000	411000	There is going to be a free week of Xbox Live for our friends overseas.
411000	425000	It's stating that you'll actually be able to use the services starting on 20th November.
425000	435000	Hey!
435000	437000	That's a different song.
437000	442000	Excuse me. I'll ferret you.
442000	446000	It's not my fault you can't tell your September from your November, okay?
446000	447000	I'm going to throw my hat at you.
447000	451000	If only Nintendo would make that mistake.
451000	463000	Back to the news. On the 20th September, Xbox Live will be free to our friends in Europe.
463000	467000	Free access. And it ends on the 29th.
467000	473000	Actually, it will be at 11.59pm. I think that's UK time.
473000	481000	So, get in all that laggy, scramble Xbox Live action while you can because I played it online and it's laggy.
481000	486000	Well, some of the games are available right now just to give a list.
486000	495000	Project Gotham Racing 3, Top Spin, 2, Table Tennis, Saints Row, World Cup Soccer, Dark Zero.
495000	500000	I'm sorry, Perfect Dark Zero, Street Fighter 2, Hyper Fighting Edition, Texas Hold'em.
500000	504000	Hey, you know what? Log on and play Uno with us.
504000	511000	Maybe we could do it. That would be a good way for us to meet some UK listeners except one of us is going to have to be awake at a god-awful hour for that to happen.
511000	512000	Unless we do it on a weekend.
512000	513000	Give it a weekend.
513000	516000	No, we could be up at like 11am. They could be at 7 o'clock at night or something.
516000	517000	With the vision camera.
517000	520000	Oh yeah, that's right. We're going to have a vision camera soon, so that would be fun.
520000	524000	We could moon our UK listeners. Wouldn't that be exciting?
524000	525000	No.
525000	526000	No, I'm sure they'd love that.
526000	533000	We'll have to learn what the proper root gestures are in British English.
533000	540000	Anyways, speaking of lame ideas, you know, rare.
540000	549000	Rare, of course, was responsible for a lot of the launch titles, or a couple of launch titles, I should say, for the Xbox 360.
549000	551000	Actually, no, I take that back. There's only one title.
551000	556000	Anyways, they had a launch title for the 360, Perfect Dark Zero.
556000	561000	And now, of course, I'm going to be announcing some more titles at X06, which is later this month.
561000	564000	Including, well, some thoughts at least.
564000	571000	Banjo 3 or Killer Instinct are some of the thoughts that may be the announcement.
571000	573000	I think it's probably a new IP.
573000	575000	Or maybe a Perfect Dark where you can jump.
575000	577000	That'd be nice.
577000	584000	But anyways, more news to come, of course, once X06 takes place in Barcelona.
584000	586000	So, look forward to that.
586000	590000	Now they're all cursing each other in UNO speak in our chat room.
590000	592000	We're cursing each other in British English.
592000	593000	Draw four, bitch.
593000	595000	No, a little bit different.
595000	601000	Black Wolf is saying, skip four, you tit.
601000	605000	And he also said, draw four, you bloody bloke.
605000	608000	That was my worst British accent ever, by the way.
608000	610000	Sorry, I won't do that again.
610000	612000	Sorry, UK folks. I apologize.
612000	615000	I apologize to the entire United Kingdom.
615000	617000	Oh, that's right.
617000	622000	I knew it was a couple, and I have to go and correct myself again.
622000	624000	Moving on to another story.
624000	627000	Final Fantasy XII, something about the current gen systems.
627000	630000	I know we've had a lot of next gen news, but something about the current gen systems.
630000	635000	They're actually going to be having a whole day to celebrate Final Fantasy XII in New York City.
635000	642000	And what's going on is that on October 12th through October 15th at the Digital Life Expo,
642000	646000	Final Fantasy XII will be appearing at the event.
646000	651000	Very cool, and I know we have a lot of fans there at New York City that want to check that out.
651000	653000	However, here's the other part you should check out.
653000	659000	October 11th is Final Fantasy XII day, and that has been declared by New York City.
659000	662000	There will be a special commemoration in Times Square.
662000	666000	Cosplayers will be abounding, I'm sure.
666000	670000	I don't see why people are making such a big deal out of something that's such a crap game.
670000	671000	You haven't even played it yet, have you?
671000	672000	Yes, I have.
672000	674000	It's incredible.
674000	675000	The demo?
675000	676000	It's going to be incredible.
676000	679000	I know. I want to play my game by myself.
679000	682000	Well, we'll just see when the full version comes out.
682000	683000	We will just see.
683000	684000	I'm still going to get it.
684000	686000	Yes, you see, fangirl.
686000	689000	I'm using Megzi's excuse.
689000	692000	Metal box.
692000	694000	Special edition.
694000	696000	Oh, special stuff.
696000	698000	Alright.
698000	701000	Anyway.
701000	708000	Well, one thing that I think a lot of us will be happy about, especially a certain somebody sitting by my foot,
708000	712000	is Kingdom Hearts 2 is getting an international version in Japan.
712000	714000	We're getting Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix,
714000	719000	which a couple of us who pay attention to our live journals have seen pictures of because somebody posted
719000	730000	a scan from a magazine of a certain somebody who was in a mask in the bonus clip for Kingdom Hearts 2.
730000	734000	Oh, so this game will actually have an ending that makes sense?
734000	736000	It made sense.
736000	737000	I'm just messing.
737000	742000	But from what that picture indicated, it's going to give us more of that little clip because
742000	748000	I don't care if I'm spoiling now, but if you get the perfect ending for Kingdom Hearts 2,
748000	753000	you get a little clip of three armored figures picking up key blades.
753000	754000	YouTube is amazing.
754000	760000	And there are, there's like a bajillion other key blades, like a graveyard around them.
760000	764000	And apparently they're going to have more of that in the ending.
764000	769000	You know how there was the deep dive in the last Kingdom Hearts.
769000	773000	But they're also saying that they're going to be incorporating the card battle,
773000	776000	the card battle system from Chain of Memories.
776000	778000	It didn't give a lot of detail.
778000	780000	Again, I saw the ad for this.
780000	783000	I've seen the article.
783000	787000	They showed it like, they actually showed, I think, the Sephiroth battle on this picture.
787000	790000	And I'll have to find out who it was on my friends list that posted the article.
790000	798000	But it had the little card icons in the side and you draw your cards and play them out like Chain of Memories.
798000	803000	But it looked really neat.
803000	806000	Another point is that they are getting all the English voices.
806000	810000	So, hey, importers, be happy.
810000	815000	You, too, can own this game and play it in an understandable language.
815000	819000	Unless you are fluent in Japanese and then you won't have a problem anyway.
819000	821000	Yay, Japanese.
821000	827000	Anyways, speaking of stuff coming out in Japan, well, this is more, of course, for the U.S.
827000	832000	We have some release dates for you, including the stuff that's coming out this week.
832000	834000	And lots of good stuff, of course.
834000	837000	My favorites being on the PlayStation 2.
837000	842000	Okami is going to be finally making its way out here, you know, very anticipated.
842000	843000	It's about fucking time.
843000	846000	Exactly.
846000	847000	We're also going to be getting...
847000	850000	I will talk with my mouth full whenever I want.
850000	853000	I am one of the hosts of this podcast, goddammit.
853000	854000	Okie dokie.
854000	857000	Sorry, I was yelling at Chris for trying to be my mommy.
857000	858000	Ok.
858000	864000	No, we're going to be getting some other stuff, including, well, some stuff for the Game Boy
864000	865000	Advance.
865000	867000	Bratz Forever Diamonds, which is also actually...
867000	868000	Actually, I take that back.
868000	870000	It's not coming out in the Game Boy Advance that week.
870000	871000	That would be in October.
871000	873000	This is incorrect.
873000	878000	Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Red Rescue Team and also Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Blue Rescue Team,
878000	881000	which is coming out in the DS will be making their way this week.
881000	885000	Open Seasons, pretty much on every single console, including the 360.
885000	888000	Why you would buy that one, I don't know.
888000	893000	Dragon Quest Heroes Rocket Slime is going to be making its way to the DS, which is pretty
893000	894000	awesome.
894000	898000	If you're a fan of Sierra games, there's going to be some PC compilations coming out for
898000	903000	you, including the King's Quest compilation, Leisure Suit Larry compilation, Police Quest,
903000	908000	Space Quest, and yeah, those would be the compilations for you.
908000	909000	Hot!
909000	913760	Samurai Warriors 2 on the 360 and PlayStation 2 are going to be coming out.
913760	918200	If you have some stuff for the 360, you're looking to pick up some games, well, The Godfather
918200	922160	is going to be coming out for you, as well as, well, not really a game, but the Xbox
922160	926360	Live Vision camera, as we mentioned earlier.
926360	927360	Let's see here.
927360	934440	World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions, which is also on PSP and PlayStation 2.
934440	937440	I might pick this up because it looks funny.
937440	945400	Cabela's Alaskan Adventure, all that ice fishing and hunting polar bears on HD there.
945400	949480	And then, no Africa on the ice, okay.
949480	955040	And then finally, on the Game Boy Advance Capcom Classics mini-mix will be making its
955040	956240	way out there.
956240	959920	And if you really buy everything for the Game Boy Advance, Fashion Dogs, where you can dress
959920	962600	up dogs on the Game Boy Advance.
962600	965560	There are people who do that for real, though, that's sad.
965560	969200	And if you're one of those people, never mind.
969200	971160	Please stop listening to OLR.
971160	975960	Oh, King of Fighters 2006, I'm sorry, was also making its way in Godfather Mob Wars.
975960	976960	Much better.
976960	983920	Well, as for our friends overseas in Europe, by the way, Suikoden 5 came out yesterday,
983920	984920	so get it.
984920	990180	But on the 21st, Jaws Unleashed, yay.
990180	994400	And then on the 22nd, FIFA 07 is coming out for everything.
994400	995400	And I'm not kidding.
995400	1000120	FIFA is coming out for damn near everything, including, you know, Nintendo Virtual Boy.
1000120	1001120	I'm kidding.
1001120	1006720	I have a Virtual Boy.
1006720	1008400	How can you still play your Virtual Boy?
1008400	1011880	Isn't that just the biggest migraine maker ever?
1011880	1013400	And I like it.
1013400	1016160	I still play Teleroboxer, damn it.
1016160	1017160	Freak.
1017160	1023200	Anyway, also coming out is Guilty Gear Dust Strikers for the DS.
1023200	1026720	Jaws Unleashed on the Xbox, which I don't know why it's not coming out on the 21st with
1026720	1029600	the other versions.
1029600	1037680	Just Cause on Xbox 360, NHL Eastside Hockey Manager 2007 on PC, PyroWorld on PC, and Saint
1037680	1041000	Seiya the Hades on PlayStation 2.
1041000	1046400	I'm glad you get it as Saint Seiya, not as, like, Warriors of the Zodiac, which is stupid.
1046400	1047400	All right.
1047400	1050720	Well, let's take a look at some release dates coming to Japan.
1050720	1053740	September 19th, you're getting Chaos Wars.
1053740	1058800	And then September 21st, you're getting an RPG made by Koei for the PlayStation 2 called
1058800	1063000	Harukanaro Jiku no Kare Mai Ichiya.
1063000	1067300	And then you're also getting NHL 06 and Rugby 06 coming out from Electronic Arts over there
1067300	1068520	in Japan.
1068520	1072960	And something I thought was very interesting also coming out on the 21st, the Game Center
1072960	1075840	of USA Midway Arcade Treasures.
1075840	1077240	Yes, this is a version.
1077240	1082400	It's a port of Midway Arcade Treasures Volume 1, it looks like, coming out on the PlayStation
1082400	1084440	2 translated into Japanese.
1084440	1087400	So I guess it's a way for them to play some of the games that were really big here in
1087400	1088720	America years ago.
1088720	1093480	So that's kind of neat to see a four-year-old game getting translated for a Japanese audience.
1093480	1095920	I think a lot of them were already out in Japan, though.
1095920	1096920	Probably.
1096920	1097920	Well, yeah.
1097920	1098920	Especially in arcade format.
1098920	1102320	But some of the games, I kind of see, because not all the games that were popular here were
1102320	1103720	popular there and so on.
1103720	1106760	Like I imagine Mortal Kombat was probably bigger here than it was there.
1106760	1107760	I don't know.
1107760	1111360	I mean, I wasn't in Japan in the mid-90s, so I don't know.
1111360	1113520	But that's what you have to look forward to this week.
1113520	1114520	Hmm.
1114520	1115520	Excellent.
1115520	1120420	Anyways, speaking of stuff that we could be looking forward to, SNK is actually trying
1120420	1124840	to make a comeback in the arcades with brand new hardware.
1124840	1125840	And they're going to be showing...
1125840	1126840	Wait a minute, though.
1126840	1127840	Wait a minute, though.
1127840	1130640	Remember when they tried the 64?
1130640	1133360	When have you ever seen an SNK machine at an arcade?
1133360	1139720	I always see these SNK machines at frickin' pizza parlors, and I saw one at the supermarket
1139720	1141840	and one at Jim Boy's Tacos, okay?
1141840	1146120	We had a six-slot MVS at my arcade.
1146120	1149000	Those SNK machines show up in the craziest fuckin' places.
1149000	1152160	And we had one of the big-screen TV ones for Samurai Shadow 3.
1152160	1153160	I saw one in a 7-Eleven.
1153160	1156240	However, Samurai Shadow 4 has a signal that resets those TVs.
1156240	1157240	It turns them off.
1157240	1158240	I'm sorry.
1158240	1160640	Did you have a story?
1160640	1167800	At the 44th amusement machine show in Japan, they were showing off...
1167800	1172240	Actually they were supporting Taito's new Type-X2 arcade board, so it's actually not
1172240	1174200	even SNK's board.
1174200	1175580	Way to go.
1175580	1182560	So they're going to be putting out some brand new games, including King of Fire's Maximum
1182560	1187880	Impact Regulation A and Samurai Spirit Sen.
1187880	1194880	Regulation A is actually based on the 3D home console fighting series by the same name,
1194880	1199000	and at least includes one new character, Ash Crimson.
1199000	1203120	Wow, Ash Crimson is such a generic sounding name.
1203120	1209760	Anyways, he's from King of Fire's O3 and King of Fire's Eleven.
1209760	1212680	Samurai Spirit Sen also play as a 3D game.
1212680	1217200	This will be the second time the sword fighting series has made its way in the arcade in 3D
1217200	1219240	since it landed on the Hyper-Neo Geo 64.
1219240	1226240	And I have a little one that remembers King of Fighter's 64.
1226240	1231840	The only good thing about that game was bringing in, what's your name, that had the two swords?
1231840	1232840	Psycho Girl.
1232840	1236760	I guess he has a big fat math for me, I've never been huge on SNK.
1236760	1241960	They announced that they're going to be releasing King of Fighter's 12 on the new hardware 2.
1241960	1244680	Goddamn, make a new game, SNK!
1244680	1246320	Make a new fucking game!
1246320	1249800	Give us Godot, Mark of the Wolves 2, give us Last Blade 3.
1249800	1250800	Give us a new game!
1250800	1251800	Give us a new series game!
1251800	1252800	Give us Last Blade 3, please!
1252800	1253800	Oh god, I'm done.
1253800	1255800	Oh my god, I love Last Blade 3.
1255800	1261600	Rob, aren't you looking forward to the Metal Slug anthology that's going to be on the
1261600	1262600	Wii?
1262600	1266600	I can't wait to play Metal Slug 413, which is like the same graphics for Metal Slug 1.
1266600	1269080	I could play Metal Slug all day, because it's all about fighting.
1269080	1274140	Okay, and King of Fighter's 2011, you know, granted Metal Slug is pretty awesome, but
1274140	1279320	you know what, it's pretty awesome like 10 years ago, okay, now, whereas, they really
1279320	1283680	need to make some different games, you know.
1283680	1288800	Don't get me wrong, I mean, SNK is cool and all, you know, Bust a Move or Puzzle Bobble,
1288800	1294640	whatever the hell you want to call it, but seriously, SNK, new fighting games, new Metal
1294640	1295640	Slug something.
1295640	1297640	Wait, wait, wait, that wasn't SNK.
1297640	1298640	What?
1298640	1301240	Oh, I keep, that was on all the freaking machines, wasn't it?
1301240	1302240	On all their machines.
1302240	1303240	We're playing more SNK now.
1303240	1304240	Sure.
1304240	1308440	But, why are they porting a shitty game like Maximum Impact?
1308440	1311960	We didn't like it here in America, they didn't like it there in Japan.
1311960	1314120	The voiceovers suck.
1314120	1317480	Port a decent game to arcades.
1317480	1325480	Well, as far as hopefully, and I would hope with 573 titles, something good will have
1325480	1326480	to be among them.
1326480	1328480	I'm sorry, was that 573 titles?
1328480	1329480	573?
1329480	1330480	Hmm, funny.
1330480	1331480	Tokyo Game Show.
1331480	1339040	It will be on display, it's actually listed up there on their website.
1339040	1342320	And Jamie's going to read all 573 games on display right now.
1342320	1344200	The hell I am.
1344200	1348380	Last year's total was 516, so they were going to type it, I guess next year's going to be
1348380	1350800	600 something?
1350800	1351800	I have a prediction.
1351800	1354560	How can you, that many freaking games?
1354560	1356520	E3 probably has more.
1356520	1358620	Konami will own Tokyo Game Show.
1358620	1363000	And I'm wondering, when are we going to get WTF?
1363000	1364000	Didn't they change the name of that?
1364000	1365000	They did.
1365000	1366320	They changed it and they changed it back.
1366320	1367320	Good for them.
1367320	1368320	WTF is coming out in October.
1368320	1369320	Good.
1369320	1370320	Book time fun.
1370320	1371320	Good for them.
1371320	1375600	But, there are actually, you know, a lot of games for PC, mobile phone games.
1375600	1379960	They're actually saying for PC and mobile phone, they had 252 titles.
1379960	1389000	For portables, DS will be bringing 52, PSP will have 33, 18 PS3 games are going to show
1389000	1392720	and they'll probably all still suck and play on Rock Mountain servers.
1392720	1397760	And 20 games coming out for Xbox 360, but they're only showing 5 for the Wii.
1397760	1401120	Wii is holding out.
1401120	1411560	The ones that they are actually going to be putting on is The Bleach Game, Shiraha Kirameku
1411560	1419320	Marvelous Interactives, Bokujo Monogatari Wii, which is still a working title, and Elibits.
1419320	1422880	They don't say if it's going to be playable or not.
1422880	1426000	And actually, they do list a lot of the games.
1426000	1428880	Well, they can go look on the web if they want to see that whole list.
1428880	1435200	Yeah, though there is a Gundam game coming out on Xbox 360, which sounds kind of cool.
1435200	1438160	It just says Gundam Operation Troy.
1438160	1441280	I'm not sure if this is one of the games they're going to show at Tokyo Game Show.
1441280	1445160	Bully, I don't know if that's going to be a big game in Japan, who knows.
1445160	1450680	But Bully got an official rating this week from the ESRB and this kind of surprised me.
1450680	1454640	Despite all the controversy that's going around, it's being rated T for Teen.
1454640	1456920	Not M for Mature, but T for Teen.
1456920	1462320	And the reason why it's been rated this way is crude humor, violence, sexual themes, language,
1462320	1466760	and use of alcohol and tobacco earned this game a T rating.
1466760	1470040	Now what's kind of interesting about this is that it seems like the expectations for
1470040	1475880	the game here might be kind of low, because it is a current gen game, and PS2 is kind
1475880	1477080	of winding down a little bit.
1477080	1480480	So it seems like, despite all this controversy and everything, people are kind of setting
1480480	1481480	themselves up for disappointment.
1481480	1482480	I don't know.
1482480	1483480	What do you think?
1483480	1484480	Look, you've been following Bully a little more than I have.
1484480	1487600	Do you think this game is going to sell awesome, or do you think most people have moved on
1487600	1489240	to Saints Row on the 360?
1489240	1492480	I would have liked to see it mature rated, but of course I understand why they're doing
1492480	1495560	it so they can sell more.
1495560	1499640	It's been delayed forever, and to be honest, some of the other Rockstar games not Grand
1499640	1500880	Theft Auto have been pretty good.
1500880	1504880	I mean, Warriors was pretty fun for a while, and then I got bored with it.
1504880	1509440	But Bully looks pretty fun, and they've got a really good system for all the classes and
1509440	1510880	stuff that you have to take.
1510880	1514000	A lot of minigames and stuff involved in that, so I think it'll be pretty good if you give
1514000	1515000	it a chance.
1515000	1516000	I don't know.
1516000	1518680	I just have to wait until it comes out, I guess.
1518680	1522080	Act Death in our chat room says, Jack Thompson will sue.
1522080	1523080	Jack Thompson's stupid.
1523080	1525880	It doesn't have anything to do with, you know, great.
1525880	1528520	So he's going to complain about this game.
1528520	1529520	Play the damn game.
1529520	1530520	You'll see that there's nothing.
1530520	1534680	I don't even think it has much to do with bullying people, to be honest, if you actually
1534680	1535680	play the game.
1535680	1538160	O.L. Army Eddie says, sexual themes?
1538160	1539200	Usually that's an automatic M.
1539200	1540200	Well, interesting.
1540200	1541200	Not necessarily.
1541200	1546360	It could just be a chick dancing in her bra or something.
1546360	1549880	That might not be M, but it might be a little bit, you know.
1549880	1553440	Not to bring this up again, but they have sexual themes in The Sims 2.
1553440	1556640	And that's rated T. Yeah, it has woohoo.
1556640	1559120	Especially if you get the special furniture with the sex animations.
1559120	1562200	Yeah, woohoo in, I think, on the couch.
1562200	1566960	Woohoo in the bed, woohoo in the hot tub, and then something else.
1566960	1567960	Woohoo indeed.
1567960	1570440	They should have been, Nintendo should have come out.
1570440	1576080	The old Sims, the first Sims game actually had someone programmed a countertop that you
1576080	1579720	could woohoo on with full animations.
1579720	1580720	Wow.
1580720	1581720	Okay.
1581720	1582720	Woohoo indeed.
1582720	1584720	But hey, online content may change.
1584720	1585720	Anyways.
1585720	1591840	So, speaking about, you know, some stuff that people think that games like Bully Cause.
1591840	1598320	Well, there was a shooter in Montreal that went and killed a bunch of people at his school,
1598320	1601440	and guess what they found as one of his favorite games.
1601440	1607020	Apparently this guy plays a lot of games, including one that happens to be Super Column
1607020	1608920	by Massacre RPG.
1608920	1614320	You know, not the sequel to Super Mario RPG, just to clear that up for you.
1614320	1615320	But uh.
1615320	1616480	Thanks, I wasn't sure.
1616480	1621140	But anyways, yeah, so apparently they're saying, oh, see, he played that game, therefore he
1621140	1624700	must have learned, you know, the kill from that game.
1624700	1629400	But apparently he also played other games, you know, that weren't violent.
1629400	1630400	Who cares?
1630400	1631400	I mean.
1631400	1635480	No, I'm thinking he was a couple bricks shy of a load, if you know what I mean, and shouldn't
1635480	1637140	have been playing any video games at all.
1637140	1639120	He should have been in school reading.
1639120	1640640	Did you see the videos of him on CNN?
1640640	1642760	No, I don't watch the news.
1642760	1648320	I watch, I do, they have CNN on them, I work, and I do regularly read CNN.com and BBC World
1648320	1649320	News.
1649320	1656040	But yes, I keep up with current events, and the guy was psycho anyway, he was talking
1656040	1660200	about how he just wanted to kill everybody, showing off his gun collection, his knife
1660200	1661200	collection.
1661200	1667440	This guy, I don't think a real gamer would have been that crazy, he was nuts.
1667440	1673160	But it's all the game's fault, it's all about the game, what did the games do to him?
1673160	1675800	I blame his psychosis and his parents for not being more observant.
1675800	1679180	I don't think it was his favorite game, but you know what, when you see that, of course,
1679180	1684120	if you're going to be trying to spin this in the news, that's going to get the most
1684120	1685120	attention.
1685120	1686880	So let's of course blame it on the games.
1686880	1689560	Naturally, lots of feedback.
1689560	1693680	Chat room over at orangeontrader.com, click on chat, olarmieddy says, Super Columbine
1693680	1696840	RPG does not glorify school shootings at all.
1696840	1701600	Let's see, I always butcher this name, Jamie, help me, Nazgul Slayer?
1701600	1702600	Nazgul?
1702600	1703600	Nazgul.
1703600	1706160	Damn it, that one fucks me up.
1706160	1711400	Nazgul Slayer says, he used RPG Maker 2000 to make Super Columbine Massacre, I read an
1711400	1712440	article about it.
1712440	1717720	So it's not really Super Columbine Massacre that's a problem, it's RPG Maker, the devil's
1717720	1718720	game.
1718720	1719720	No, no, no.
1719720	1721720	I'm attacking the darkness.
1721720	1724600	I'm using magic missile.
1724600	1730440	Sakurina would like to point out, also his gun was legal but his clips weren't.
1730440	1732680	Hmm, interesting.
1732680	1742760	You know what, this is, it just further illustrates that society is more ready to look for a scapegoat
1742760	1745720	than actually treat the true root of the problem.
1745720	1747780	Do these kind of stories make you angry, DarkSakura?
1747780	1751120	They make me furious, livid, ludicrously livid.
1751120	1752860	Do they make you want to rant a little bit?
1752860	1755120	They make me want to go to a school and shoot people.
1755120	1774920	Well it wouldn't be episode 200 of a podcast without the FUs of the Week.
1774920	1782160	My FU of the Week, I can't believe I completely blamed, I had what my FU was going to be and
1782160	1785840	it wasn't related to traffic at all.
1785840	1789800	My FU of the Week goes toward the Japantown Anime Festival.
1789800	1793960	Oh my god, crappiest convention ever.
1793960	1798560	Well, in their defense they were pretty small.
1798560	1800840	I mean, but still.
1800840	1805200	Hey, that's not nice talking about the Japanese being small.
1805200	1808240	Okay, this is my Pokemon.
1808240	1810240	You connect all your Pokemon.
1810240	1817600	I understand, my problem with it being, no this is in San Francisco by the way, my problem
1817600	1823720	with it was that it suffered the same problem that AX started to suffer, as in being spread
1823720	1829640	across different areas, you had to go from one mall to the other, into the hotel, into
1829640	1837000	the courtyard downstairs under Kinokuniya at Kintetsu Mall, but they had a pretty good
1837000	1839600	band that we were there for listening to the warm up, they actually sounded pretty cool
1839600	1845880	but the dealer's room, it was a dealer's closet, the closet, and they had some interesting
1845880	1851200	stuff, some nice stuff, but you know, overall it was pretty much what you could find online
1851200	1852200	pretty easily.
1852200	1855800	But the cost, the way I was most disappointed with was the cosplay.
1855800	1861080	I expected to go and see people taking advantage of the opportunity to cosplay, there was a
1861080	1866920	pretty big Naruto group, there was a pretty big bleach group, but it's been done.
1866920	1873880	Yeah, I could go see that at any other convention, we did meet lots of nice people, we met some
1873880	1879920	people on DA, on DeviantArt who were really cool, but overall I think I had a higher expectation
1879920	1883920	for it just because of how it was being played up, they were having all this different stuff
1883920	1890280	go on, and it really was just, just, blah.
1890280	1894640	The only advantage of it is that our badges gave us discounts at the stores, so I could
1894640	1898720	buy porn.
1898720	1906040	Um, Loki, you have views of the week, mine don't have to do with porn.
1906040	1911600	F you to Wicker Man, that movie, why did they have to kill Nicolas Cage's character off,
1911600	1916040	I mean, it was getting good, like the whole movie is kind of like eh, okay this whole
1916040	1917040	island with...
1917040	1920200	Wow, thanks for saving me ten bucks!
1920200	1922360	And isn't that how the original ended?
1922360	1924000	Yes, but I'll get to that.
1924000	1927680	So here's the thing, why did they have to kill his character off, it started getting
1927680	1932120	good, I mean he punched a woman in the face, and I was like, god damn this movie's gonna
1932120	1938120	be awesome, then, fucking um, oh god I can't remember her name, the chick from Save the
1938120	1942720	Last Dance or whatever, I think she was in that, and she like lunges at me, like does
1942720	1945880	a sidekick and kicks her into the wall, I'm like, oh my god this movie just got a hundred
1945880	1950320	times better, and then they had to go set him on fire, so you know, that fucking sucks.
1950320	1954280	I don't care if that's how the original sucked, the end, actually the whole movie should have
1954280	1960400	had just like Chuck Norris killing people, and that would have been a lot better.
1960400	1965680	The Wicker Man is supposed to be burnt, for any of our fellow pagans listening to the
1965680	1966680	show.
1966680	1967680	The Burning Man?
1967680	1971520	Yeah, the whole movie reminded me of Burning Man, like in Seattle or something, you know,
1971520	1978320	it's like, alright, um, my FU of the week goes to my iPod, which upon boot up today
1978320	1980720	gave me a frowny face of death.
1980720	1986000	I blame iTunes 7, because ever since I installed iTunes 7, that thing started acting weird,
1986000	1990480	like iTunes did not want to talk to my old ass, you know, fourth gen iPod or whatever
1990480	1996040	it is, the black and white before they were color, iPod, so, FU iTunes 7 for ruining my
1996040	2001960	iPod, and now I can't listen to podcasts in my car, so, no Bobby, no All Games, no other
2001960	2008120	podcasts I listen to, or OLR in my car for a while, until I can afford the video iPod.
2008120	2015440	So FU frowny face of death, I blame Apple, Loki, just bite your tongue, Chris, I blame
2015440	2018760	the lack of rockbox, how about your, okay, Drew Nami, your FUs of the week.
2018760	2024280	Alright, first off, FU to missing class, for an entire week, including the week where both
2024280	2029760	the practice test and the test were going on, due to people having appointments and
2029760	2035680	me either forgetting or them not telling me, I can't remember which, aside from that, just
2035680	2042720	FU to having a very blah week, with nothing else going on, so, no FUs at all for, you
2042720	2045720	know, past that, Chris?
2045720	2049600	I just wanted to really quickly say, sorry to the chatroom, restore didn't work and reset
2049600	2053720	didn't work, thanks for the thought, but, tried it, sorry.
2053720	2061480	Okay, for lack of anything better, my FU of the week is to my bed at home, it for some
2061480	2067280	reason thinks that I need to be molested in the middle of the night, what kind of bed
2067280	2074280	is this, I want to buy one, IKEA actually, alright, okay, there is only one bed, god
2074280	2081740	I love Sweden, okay, I'd never let any of my friends, ABBA and molesting beds, it doesn't
2081740	2087800	get much better than that, do you want to hear my story or not, okay, okay, we, okay,
2087800	2091000	there's only one other bed that's available at my house when my friends come over and
2091000	2096040	that's the one my dad and his girlfriend use, so they have to sleep in my bed and twice
2096040	2101880	I woke it up to my friends trying to molest me, Jamie slept in there last night and she
2101880	2113400	was all trying to pet my chest, okay, I was having a dream, this show just got a lot hotter,
2113400	2118240	I was having a dream about a couple of characters and they were like just sleeping in the bed
2118240	2123120	and there was a cat there and this is what Shermie does, she'll crawl in the bed between
2123120	2128520	me and Dan and I'll reach over and pet her, so in the dream, I guess the character there
2128520	2133320	in my dream was reaching over to pet the cat and I opened my eyes to see my hand hovering
2133320	2139240	over Kristen's chest and I was like oh you're not a cat, that was Marissa's reaction except
2139240	2146400	she said oh you don't have a penis, she thought my friend Marissa came down a few weekends
2146400	2151400	ago and she thought I was her boyfriend Christopher and was all rubbing my back and she's like
2151400	2156040	oh wait you don't have a penis and turned over and fell asleep, so people want to molest
2156040	2158800	me in my bed.
2158800	2163480	And to respond to Jeremy Todd, I have had a hot lesbian dream about Angelina Jolie,
2163480	2164480	thank you.
2164480	2169880	I think I've had a hot lesbian dream about Angelina Jolie, actually, who hasn't had a
2169880	2170880	hot lesbian dream about her?
2170880	2173720	I'm not kidding either and I also had one about Billy Paper.
2173720	2188400	Alright anyway, we had a story earlier in the program about Final Fantasy XII and Final
2188400	2192720	Fantasy XII Day, well maybe there will be two Final Fantasy XII Days because guess what?
2192720	2197980	There is a Final Fantasy XII related title coming to the DS, not a lot of information
2197980	2202360	on it at this time, it is called Final Fantasy Revenant Wings and it's going to be a sequel
2202360	2211120	to Final Fantasy XII and will be available on Nintendo DS, hmm interesting.
2211120	2215640	We do know it's got a pirate themed storyline and could possibly be a prequel, not a sequel
2215640	2217320	to Final Fantasy XII.
2217320	2223360	That's interesting that it's on the PSP, oh maybe because PSP sucks in Japan.
2223360	2225680	Don't know, don't know.
2225680	2231500	Alright well Dark Sakura, for 200 weeks now she's surfed the internet up and down, actually
2231500	2235040	just kidding because we didn't have this segment until about 170, but she surfs the internet
2235040	2239320	up and down each and every week to find a website that you want to be visiting and she
2239320	2242640	shares it with you folks in a segment we call the website of the week.
2242640	2248600	Dark Sakura, where should the kids be pointing their browsers to this week?
2248600	2254160	The website of the week, this one is a very special one, especially for episode 200.
2254160	2260380	The website of the week is orangeloungeradio.com, you must go to our site everyday, hang out
2260380	2264880	on our forums, we are awesome, if you find news stories, link them up there, if we don't
2264880	2270600	think it's utter crap then we'll put it up on the board and you get to talk to us, because
2270600	2271600	it's special.
2271600	2279000	And you know I figured it's about damn time that I plug our own damn site, so orangeloungeradio.com
2279000	2284160	is the site of the week, shameless self-promotion, damn right.
2284160	2294280	And you can go to E3 on PSP, it's about as updated as the OLR on PSP.
2294280	2301080	If you want to see something that hasn't been updated in like 5 years, there's darksakura.com.
2301080	2306840	Seriously I haven't updated it in 5 years.
2306840	2307840	Good job!
2307840	2310600	And we have our blogs at stuff.orangeloungeradio.com.
2310600	2313160	Those blogs haven't been updated in like a year.
2313160	2314600	Well alright, we better.
2314600	2315600	Get on that.
2315600	2318440	And there's my Jack Thompson is a Bully rant on there too.
2318440	2321080	There's some good reads on there if you haven't seen it yet.
2321080	2328200	Anyways, what's kind of interesting and very disappointing to me is that it was announced
2328200	2335640	this week that the PS3 controller will not be named Poos, it will be named Sixaxis or
2335640	2343360	Siaxis or whatever, it basically comes from the fact that the controller has six different
2343360	2349400	axes of motion sensing, and yeah, since it doesn't rumble I guess they can't really call
2349400	2351080	it DualShock now can they?
2351080	2356640	So Sixaxis is the name of the controller, hooray.
2356640	2359580	It's also Palindrome.
2359580	2360920	How do we find this out for sure?
2360920	2362840	How do we know for sure that this is the name of it?
2362840	2372480	Well actually this was from a patent, or I should say a trademark that was registered,
2372480	2376460	and it's been pulled up and it's owned by Sony, so hurrah.
2376460	2379040	What if they're just trying a couple things out?
2379040	2385720	It's true, I don't know if it's for sure, but you know what, it's also been mentioned
2385720	2393320	Sixaxis in a few different PR things, not as, you know, it might be like the system,
2393320	2397760	named for the system of the motion sensing, like for example, it says, this one quote
2397760	2402120	here, the controller for the PS3 employs breakthrough technology of high precision, highly sensitive
2402120	2408840	Sixaxis sensing system that does not require any devices other than the controller itself
2408840	2411640	for seamless interactive operation.
2411640	2418080	So that might be just, you know, the technology they're calling it Sixaxis, I don't know.
2418080	2419080	Interesting.
2419080	2423600	All right, well every week you guys write us letters and we read them right here on
2423600	2425960	Orange Lounge Radio's podcast.
2425960	2429580	If you want to send us an email, it's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and when you send
2429580	2439920	your email, Dark Sakura suits up in her biohazard suit and puts on her rubber gloves, and digs
2439920	2443320	on into the mailbag and pulls out some of her favorite emails that she's going to share
2443320	2448120	with us right now, and these are special emails because this is the 200th episode worth of
2448120	2449120	emails.
2449120	2457600	So if you're in tonight's mailbag, you're very special, boys and girls.
2457600	2462240	Some skanky, skanky hoe bag named DisneyPunk10 sent us an email.
2462240	2467600	This says, all you guys suck, Rob is not sexy, Loki is stupid, Jamie is a mean bitch.
2467600	2471680	Your show is full of lesbians and 30-year-old children who live in their parents' cellar.
2471680	2472680	Die!
2472680	2473680	Is that good enough hate mail?
2473680	2476360	No, you know I love you guys, happy 200.
2476360	2478520	Chris, isn't your online name DisneyPunk10?
2478520	2479520	DisneyButt?
2479520	2480520	DisneyButt?
2480520	2483720	That's why I'm going to start calling you after that email.
2483720	2484720	Why, yes!
2484720	2489120	As a matter of fact, DisneyPunk10 is my handle.
2489120	2491480	That's an awful coincidence.
2491480	2492640	Well thanks for the hate mail.
2492640	2494600	We love getting hate mail at orangeloungeradio.com.
2494600	2495600	Bitch.
2495600	2498160	We'll get Maisie to check it out of her later.
2498160	2500280	Nah, she brings me cake, I love her.
2500280	2501280	And donuts.
2501280	2502280	And crowns.
2502280	2503280	And crowns.
2503280	2504280	Yep.
2504280	2509600	I'm going to go parade in the living room right now while Jamie reads the next email
2509600	2512720	and listen for the laughter.
2512720	2517320	You look like such a lovely princess, Rob.
2517320	2524040	And anyway, our next email comes from Robert M. Now that Apple has announced that you can
2524040	2529200	purchase games for the iPod, what do you see becoming of this form of mobile gaming?
2529200	2534040	I may pick up Bejeweled just to see, but later it'll be interesting to see how the unit's
2534040	2537600	limited control are basically like an Atari 2600 paddle controller.
2537600	2541320	I really wonder even seeing the preview of how Pac-Man is controlled is used.
2541320	2546600	I can imagine a great version of Jairus for instance.
2546600	2549560	Also how does this open up the possibility of homebrewed games?
2549560	2552760	It's easy to make your own music and movies and play them on the iPod without ever starting
2552760	2556840	an account to buy them, but what about those with skill and patience to program full games?
2556840	2558880	I thought they already had homebrew games.
2558880	2564240	Like they had Doom on there for what reason, I don't know.
2564240	2567320	They said hail to the queen when I walked out there.
2567320	2568600	Bitches.
2568600	2573120	I think since they've already got it, we'll see more homebrew games.
2573120	2574160	I missed the reading of the email.
2574160	2575160	Was this about the iPod games?
2575160	2576160	Yeah.
2576160	2578160	Okay, because I dug in there earlier in the week.
2578160	2582240	I thought I saw some gay in there.
2582240	2583240	I don't know.
2583240	2587440	The problem with gaming on the iPod is that frickin' wheel.
2587440	2588840	That's not the best controller in the world.
2588840	2592520	You know what would be great though is that little thing that you plug your USB thing
2592520	2593520	into in the bottom?
2593520	2598600	Wouldn't that be an awesome place to just jam a controller into and then there you go.
2598600	2599600	That's what Apple should do.
2599600	2600600	Apple will make more money.
2600600	2602240	I think that would be a smart idea.
2602240	2605840	If Apple wanted to get into gaming on the iPod, that would be a great addition, but
2605840	2606840	what do I know?
2606840	2608600	I'm just some schmo on the internet.
2608600	2614480	Our next email says, Dear OLR crew, I would like to say thank you for the past 1.5 years
2614480	2615480	of entertainment.
2615480	2619540	I went into the gigantic list of gaming podcasts and my first random pick happened to be this
2619540	2620540	wonderful podcast.
2620540	2622640	I've been listening ever since and it's been fun.
2622640	2625000	The host and guest hosts are great.
2625000	2630240	Also this podcast introduced to some of the coolest bands, Gorillaz, Freeze Pop, Games
2630240	2635080	Guitar Hero, Katamari, Websites, Gorillaz and Official DeviantArt, and Survival Tips.
2635080	2637200	I now know how to stop a camel.
2637200	2640440	Thanks for being a part of all your listener's life.
2640440	2641440	Reject false icons.
2641440	2642440	Ion671.
2642440	2643440	PS.
2643440	2644440	Come to the East Coast sometime.
2644440	2648920	That was sweet and I'm coming to New York City end of October and I'm going to be going
2648920	2650800	to the Nintendo World Store to meet fans.
2650800	2651800	So I don't know what day that is.
2651800	2653800	I would like to go, but I'm going to YowieCon.
2653800	2654800	Hot.
2654800	2657200	That was a sweet email.
2657200	2658200	Thank you.
2658200	2659200	Heart.
2659200	2664840	For anyone who wants to know where I got my survival tips from, it's the Worst Case Scenario
2664840	2665840	Survival Handbook.
2665840	2666840	Whoa.
2666840	2667840	Sorry.
2667840	2668840	Sorry.
2668840	2669840	We had a snafu there.
2669840	2671600	A Neverending Story started playing in the background there.
2671600	2672600	Sorry guys.
2672600	2674320	The Neverending Soda.
2674320	2678320	My bad.
2678320	2680840	Next up is Warrior Bob.
2680840	2682440	That's such a cool name.
2682440	2683440	Hello again.
2683440	2685680	It was neat to hear my last letter read on air.
2685680	2686680	Thanks for that.
2686680	2690880	You are correct that you guys were invited to Cal Poly SLO sometime last year, although
2690880	2695080	it wasn't me, but rather our DDR Club President, a guy named Joe Etter, who actually invited
2695080	2698840	you to come down to a Bamani-related event that the club ran.
2698840	2700240	That's what it is.
2700240	2704240	Of course, if you ever do make it to my school, I bet we could arrange to have all our part
2704240	2706740	of the show broadcast over our local station.
2706740	2713240	You probably have to tone down the lesbian pillow fights, but it may be a good way to
2713240	2717280	get some exposure to the non-podcast audience.
2717280	2720840	Reading that again to myself, I suppose lesbian pillow fights may have a similar effect.
2720840	2723000	You know, I didn't mean to bring that in.
2723000	2724000	That was an accident.
2724000	2725000	No, it's fine.
2725000	2726000	It's fine.
2726000	2731280	Regardless, were it feasible, I'd definitely attend a traveling OLR show.
2731280	2734680	I had to miss the Fonami panel last spring, so I'd love to have that sort of thing happen
2734680	2735680	again.
2735680	2736680	We will, by the way, be at Fonami next year.
2736680	2741200	Fonami next year, and it looks like Sakura Con is also for Seattle people.
2741200	2746040	We're going to be there, and possibly, at least myself, we'll be at one East Coast Con,
2746040	2748520	so we're going to be doing Anime Cons up the butt next year.
2748520	2752960	I want to try and get to Otacon next year, but I can't get to Otacon for that yet, but
2752960	2753960	more on this.
2753960	2754960	Huh?
2754960	2760560	I'm going to Asa next year, and Megzi, so we can try something.
2760560	2761560	Flyer girls!
2761560	2765440	We can walk around with a shirt or something stupid like that.
2765440	2767200	Afterwards we'll drink Guinness and play old games.
2767200	2768200	It'll be a party.
2768200	2769200	I love Guinness.
2769200	2770200	That is hot.
2770200	2771200	That is my idea of a party.
2771200	2773500	Looking forward to your show hitting the podcast stream, so I'll hear you then.
2773500	2774500	Have a great night.
2774500	2776480	Unrelatedly, fuck Pyrite.
2776480	2777480	Amen!
2777480	2779120	Pyrite is a cult.
2779120	2781520	That is a card-carrying OLR member.
2781520	2785120	For a second there, I thought you said Pyrite, and I'm like, damn that fool's goal, damn
2785120	2786120	it!
2786120	2787520	Pyrite is also a false icon.
2787520	2792640	Pyrite is cool because it crystalizes in cube form.
2792640	2794640	I took chemistry, hello!
2794640	2796360	For science!
2796360	2797360	Science and technology!
2797360	2798360	Anyway.
2798360	2799360	Science!
2799360	2802360	We should ban Dihydrogen Monoxide.
2802360	2807040	Yeah, you know that Dihydrogen Monoxide is just... water.
2807040	2808040	I know.
2808040	2810040	Wasn't that on an episode of...
2810040	2811040	Penn & Teller's bullshit.
2811040	2814040	One of my friends was just telling me about that episode.
2814040	2815040	Anyway, next email.
2815040	2816040	Okay.
2816040	2819480	Hey, OLR, just wanted to congratulate you on your 200th episode since I won't be listening
2819480	2820480	live tonight.
2820480	2821480	Have a good one.
2821480	2822480	And that's from Mike.
2822480	2825160	Thank you.
2825160	2826160	Next one up.
2826160	2827240	Ooh, long one.
2827240	2833600	Not long one, but this is actually from Kenji, who I posted his email as my email of the
2833600	2834600	month.
2834600	2835600	Oh, this is our essay writer.
2835600	2838220	I'm going to start doing an email of the month, by the way, so make sure you start sending
2838220	2843240	in very thoughtful and well-written things that don't have hate in them.
2843240	2845520	Happy 200th episode, OLR.
2845520	2848080	Congratulations on making it this far, and here's hoping for your continued successes
2848080	2849080	and good fortune.
2849080	2850080	Cheers.
2850080	2851080	This won't be long.
2851080	2853680	I figure that everything I mention in this letter will already be mentioned before you
2853680	2855440	even touch this week's mailbag.
2855440	2857320	They blew it, blew it, blew it, blew it.
2857320	2860200	Nintendo couldn't have been set up any better.
2860200	2862360	$600 PS3 on November 17th.
2862360	2864280	Ken Kutaragi stick up his ass.
2864280	2868760	Microsoft with a dollar sign problem with selling 360s in every other market in the
2868760	2869760	U.S.
2869760	2870760	The cards were all laid out in Nintendo's favor.
2870760	2875400	All Reggie had to say was $199, October something or the other, and get off the stage.
2875400	2876400	But they didn't.
2876400	2880400	That isn't to say it's not a bad thing selling two days of GASP after the already impossible
2880400	2883840	to reserve PS3 for $250 with a pack-in compilation game.
2883840	2887140	It's just that they could have really went over the hearts and minds of gamers and non-gamers
2887140	2891040	alike with a cheaper price point, or included a second controller set.
2891040	2893480	But is Nintendo selling systems at a profit?
2893480	2894480	What else is new?
2894480	2898360	Also, does anyone else see the pick-to-chat-like qualities in the Wii channels?
2898360	2901080	Hell, it might just be the system alone.
2901080	2905160	Just as pick-to-chat sold DS systems in Japan without selling any accompanying software,
2905160	2908680	photo channel and the Mii channel especially seem to be the quirky things that'll keep
2908680	2910480	non-gamers entertained for hours.
2910480	2915680	Then they have the Wii forums, where you can post stuff with your character chair as your
2915680	2916680	little avatar.
2916680	2918780	Yeah, but that's specific to your Wii, right?
2918780	2920120	That's not internet Wii.
2920120	2921120	I'm not sure.
2921120	2922120	I think it was your own Wii.
2922120	2924600	It was like for family members to leave messages to each other.
2924600	2925600	Hi, Mom!
2925600	2926600	You suck!
2926600	2927600	Stop playing!
2927600	2928600	Dad's a whore.
2928600	2933160	For a good time, call Mom at...
2933160	2934160	Last night!
2934160	2935160	Ooh!
2935160	2942080	And it said, uh, man, just my opinions from a slightly educated gamer, but if you haven't
2942080	2947520	answered this already, will the higher next, near next-gen price point keep you guys from
2947520	2948520	getting a Wii?
2948520	2949840	Thanks and congrats again, Kenji.
2949840	2955160	Well, didn't he say, I mean, I think this guy's great and all because he has a lot to
2955160	2959160	say, but didn't he just say, you know, Nintendo fucked up and then he said, but it sounds
2959160	2960560	kind of neat.
2960560	2965720	I think what the intention was is that Nintendo could have gotten a whole lot more in terms
2965720	2969840	of new people buying the system had it just been dropped a little bit more, had a few
2969840	2971520	more pack-ins.
2971520	2972520	It's not doom and gloom.
2972520	2974800	It's still the cheapest.
2974800	2977320	It's still the cheapest one on the shelf.
2977320	2980240	It's not only the cheapest one on the shelf, but it's the cheapest one on the shelf with
2980240	2981240	the game.
2981240	2984440	And you can buy that in a 360 and still not pay as much as you would for...
2984440	2985440	Wii 60!
2985440	2990560	I'm pre-ordering one in both GameStop and my work, so I may have two.
2990560	2994640	Because my GameStop, or my one where I work, will probably be getting it in on Wednesday
2994640	2996360	before the launch.
2996360	2999440	I'm not allowed to talk about how I'm getting a Wii, but I am getting a Wii, and I will
2999440	3001640	have it on release day.
3001640	3004080	Well, we'll have ours on release day.
3004080	3006080	We all will because we're special.
3006080	3009360	Anyway, the last email tonight comes from Alessa.
3009360	3010360	Cool.
3010360	3012080	Dude, like Silent Hill?
3012080	3013080	I don't know.
3013080	3014520	I don't know if I'm excited about that.
3014520	3015520	No, I'm kidding.
3015520	3019880	It's actually a link to an article about a father that killed his child over a video
3019880	3020880	game.
3020880	3023880	Is there a hole in the email?
3023880	3024880	Oh no.
3024880	3025880	What happened?
3025880	3026880	And I looked at this.
3026880	3027880	I'll link it in the chat.
3027880	3028880	What's he playing World of Warcraft?
3028880	3029880	It's on NBC10.com.
3029880	3031880	I'll just read a little bit of the article.
3031880	3035060	A 25-year-old North Philadelphia man has been charged with killing his young daughter.
3035060	3042920	The mother said 17-month-old Alaya was violently punched by Tyrone Spellman over a video game.
3042920	3047920	Reading further in the article, apparently, just being a cute little kid, she was pulling
3047920	3054640	on the controller cord, playing with it, and the system fell, and he apparently was so
3054640	3057960	upset he punched her in the face twice.
3057960	3061760	When the mother came in to ask, because she was taking a nap.
3061760	3063460	She didn't know anything was happening.
3063460	3069360	When she got up to check on her daughter, she asked why she's not breathing, and he
3069360	3070360	said, she's breathing.
3070360	3072440	She's just asleep or something like that.
3072440	3081000	She called the ambulance, and she was pronounced dead at the scene.
3081000	3082720	Apparently this guy was supposed to be...
3082720	3089640	They said that he was a fairly non-violent person, but first of all, I think the game
3089640	3091280	has nothing to do with it.
3091280	3096880	What if he had been playing, building a house of cards, and she knocked it over?
3096880	3102180	If he's given to punch somebody over something, especially a child, over something so trivial,
3102180	3103640	he would have done it over anything.
3103640	3106040	There's some type of violent gene there.
3106040	3109360	That's definitely, has nothing to do with a video game.
3109360	3112040	That is one seriously, mentally fucked up person.
3112040	3116400	On a completely unrelated note, five bucks says it was Madden.
3116400	3118980	I kid, I kid, I kid.
3118980	3119980	You can direct an email.
3119980	3124560	Baby Tossing 2000, you know, on the Xbox 360 Arcade, apparently.
3124560	3127000	It actually doesn't say what game it is.
3127000	3130440	Nintendog Sniper 2006.
3130440	3134520	The sad thing is that the lady was pregnant with another, she's eight months pregnant
3134520	3136560	with another baby.
3136560	3139040	The good news is he'll be the hell away from that one.
3139040	3140880	Well, yeah, he is locked up.
3140880	3144040	They're actually charging him with murder, endangering the welfare of a child, and possession
3144040	3146200	of an instrument of crime.
3146200	3151500	And but the thing that struck me is that the lady was saying that, you know, that her daughter
3151500	3154160	is never going to meet her big sister.
3154160	3155560	That was what got me on that.
3155560	3158520	GS68 in our chat room says, I'll say it now.
3158520	3160160	Shut up, Jack.
3160160	3163880	Seriously, you know he's going to hop on that shit.
3163880	3168940	But again, I don't think it was what he was doing so much.
3168940	3173520	You know, if she had toppled over something else he might have been working on, if he
3173520	3179640	was that mentally unstable to strike a child, you know, then he would have done it over
3179640	3181640	anything.
3181640	3186640	Well, I'm not sure how to transition into this story.
3186640	3191640	I suppose I could say something about at least he didn't throw the Guitar Hero controller.
3191640	3192640	I don't know.
3192640	3195000	But this is a story on Guitar Hero 2.
3195000	3197080	New song is announced for the game.
3197080	3201880	Mega Death with Hangar 18 is supposedly going to be like the last final boss song in the
3201880	3202880	game.
3202880	3203880	Pretty rad.
3203880	3208560	Aerosmith with Last Child, and this song I think is pretty cool coming to Guitar Hero
3208560	3209560	2.
3209560	3211760	Cheap Trick with Surrender.
3211760	3212880	That's going to be kind of fun.
3212880	3213880	I like that.
3213880	3216440	They've already announced the one song I was most interested in, though.
3216440	3217440	What the Spinal Tap?
3217440	3218440	No, YYZ.
3218440	3219440	Oh.
3219440	3220440	Aren't you a big fan of the Spinal Tap?
3220440	3221440	I love Rush.
3221440	3222440	All right.
3222440	3223440	Rush is cool.
3223440	3228380	Anyways, I'm glad to see that Guitar Hero 2 seems to be on its way to being finished.
3228380	3234200	Here's another game which supposedly is going to be finished pretty soon.
3234200	3238580	Duke Nukem Forever is apparently in the polish stage.
3238580	3240760	I don't know what that thought does that mean.
3240760	3242080	The polish stage?
3242080	3247280	It means that the physics and animation systems are virtually finished and shippable.
3247280	3250020	It's simply maintenance and polish from here on out.
3250020	3255200	We haven't needed to make substantial changes to those systems in months.
3255200	3258040	I think they mean polishes and polishing a turd.
3258040	3259400	The changes have been made.
3259400	3260800	Sorry the game's delayed.
3260800	3267080	We've all been too busy polishing our poles.
3267080	3272640	Then he goes on to say, things are never as bleak as they appear, as often is the case
3272640	3275880	when you simply have one side of the story.
3275880	3281640	This is coming from 3D Realms president George Broussard.
3281640	3288520	I don't know, I would think that a ten year delay on the game is pretty bleak if you ask
3288520	3289520	me.
3289520	3291520	It worked for Prey.
3291520	3293080	No, it didn't really work for Prey.
3293080	3294600	True said it worked for Prey.
3294600	3295600	Prey?
3295600	3296600	I don't think so.
3296600	3298480	It wasn't that great of a game.
3298480	3299480	Prey's kind of fun.
3299480	3305480	It was kind of fun, but kind of fun isn't like, wow, ten years in the making.
3305480	3310200	We'll see how the free expansion pack is that's supposedly coming.
3310200	3318440	Well, you know how we're always bringing up some of our more quirky games?
3318440	3322080	Well, Majesco is bringing Cake Mania to the DS.
3322080	3325760	Did anybody get Cooking Mama?
3325760	3327660	Actually wasn't Majesco talking about that game?
3327660	3331320	I was looking at a Miggletop's copy of Cooking Mama, but I didn't get a chance to play it,
3331320	3332320	but I hear it's kind of fun.
3332320	3335320	Sorry, Cake Mania makes me think, you know, it makes me think of cooking.
3335320	3336320	Sorry.
3336320	3342920	They actually mentioned Cooking Mama in this, but they're actually bringing out Cake Mania.
3342920	3349160	It's an online game from Sandlot Games, but Cake Mania will bring in the touch screen
3349160	3354960	part so you can bake your cakes with extra touch power, I guess, but it will be the full
3354960	3359420	game plus the Back to the Bakery expansion pack.
3359420	3364760	So if anyone's into the weirdo quirk stuff, it will be coming out for 20 bucks.
3364760	3365760	All right.
3365760	3369980	It's developed by Digital Embryo, which I think is a cool name.
3369980	3373640	Another series that Majesco is going to be bringing out, they have two titles in development
3373640	3374980	for the Wii.
3374980	3378800	One of them is Bust a Move, because that freaking game comes out on every console.
3378800	3383720	Sorry, I meant the American Bust a Move or Puzzle Bobble, not the other Bust a Move that
3383720	3385720	you guys are big fans of.
3385720	3391040	The other one that they are bringing over is supposed to be a mystery title.
3391040	3393800	It's going to be something that makes use of the Wiimote.
3393800	3397960	Oh, I'm sorry, no, that's more on the Bust a Move, is that it will be using the Wiimote's
3397960	3398960	motion.
3398960	3400760	There is actually no other information about the other title.
3400760	3403120	I wonder if it's not kind of a... Oh, no, because it's for the Wii.
3403120	3406560	I was wondering if it was maybe the Cake Mania thing came out later or something, but I guess
3406560	3407560	not.
3407560	3408880	There's ones for the DS and ones for the Wii.
3408880	3412480	So we should have more information pretty soon.
3412480	3417240	Anyway, that's going to bring to an end this part B of our podcast.
3417240	3419640	I know you guys are thinking, wait a minute, you haven't taken calls yet.
3419640	3421280	You haven't done last minute stories yet.
3421280	3426040	Well, tonight, guys, for our very special episode number 200, we're going to be doing
3426040	3428880	a part C. So we're going to go to a quick break here.
3428880	3431720	We'll come back with Orange Launch Radio part C, and I'll tell you what, part C is going
3431720	3435080	to be very different tonight because we're going to do a little bit of gaming news and
3435080	3439580	then it's about us and kind of celebrating 200 episodes of Orange Launch Radio and taking
3439580	3440580	your calls.
3440580	3445120	We've got a lot to take a look at, and it will all be on Orange Launch Radio part C
3445120	3447840	right after this.
3447840	3449440	How does it all end?
3449440	3463680	Find out later this week when part C of episode 200 hits our podcast feed.
