Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 201 for this September the 24th of 2006.
and we've got a case of the giggles sorry about that but that's part of our live segment that you can only hear when you listen to us live sorry podcast fans we have to do something special for the live listeners whether it be here on OrangeLaunchRadio.com or AllGames.com anyway we're going to get back into the news now however and I'm going to start off this segment of news
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
The console will be coming to New Zealand on December 7th.
Wii Sports will be a pack-in game, just like here in the US.
It will cost 499 New Zealand dollars, which translates to about 261 euros, 330 American dollars.
So, by the way, New Zealand is actually having to pay a little bit more than Australia for that.
Dope.
But at least you get in the console relatively early and not getting the shaft on release dates.
So, you know, at least that's some consolation, I hope.
I don't know.
I guess.
Does it just strike me funny that consolation is almost a pun?
Consolation, yeah.
Anyways, some of the news we actually talked about a while back was how the Wii wasn't going to have a digital audio out port.
And we were wondering why that, you know, I think I made the point that that wasn't really important.
Well...
In the case now, it really isn't important because we found out that we will only be supporting Dolby ProLogic 2 technology.
So, you know, you can just use your standard red and white audio cables for that kind of stuff.
But I guess it's cool that it has some sort of quasi-surround sound to it.
I mean, not that it really needs too much since it has the speaker and the controller which I guess they could use for some semi-surround sound, but
Whatever.
I mean, it's not a surprise when the game isn't, you know, HD, you know, really anyways.
Maybe it's just me.
And let me go out here on a limb, and I'm sure to piss somebody off with this, you know, thing I'm about to say, but whatever.
It's my view.
I don't really get all like, oh, gosh, the sound in this game was so crystal clear amazing.
Wow, when I shot that guy in the face, I could really hear that in full, you know, 31.11 surround super uber Dolby sound or whatever.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
After having played games in Surround Sound, oh hell yeah, especially for anything that's scary, where those little side noises are gonna... Especially since you've got your speaker in the Wii controller, having that full Surround Sound... Okay, do you want to go see your movie in just mono, or do you want to see it in Surround Sound?
Well, I mean, it depends.
If I'm watching a comedy...
It doesn't really matter.
If you have the capability to play it in surround sound, don't you want the full effect?
It is kind of weird, though, that it does have a speaker in the controller, because they're trying to make it more immersive, and yet they're not supporting immersive sound.
I don't know.
Let me phrase it this way.
I've never had a crappy sound system take the game experience away from me, I guess.
Maybe I've just played the wrong games on those uber surround systems.
I really haven't played a lot of survival horror on those systems, so maybe I'm just not playing the right games.
I don't know.
It could be the game.
Well, if it isn't much of a surprise, of course, the same info came out this week that Dolby is also going to be providing the sound technology for the PlayStation 3, including Dolby Digital's 5.1 surround, and you better believe that they're going to be pushing this crap.
Sony will also be supporting Dolby's true HD sound for decoding up to 7.1 channels.
for playback of movie titles in the Blu-ray disc format and probably games.
So I think that's kind of interesting, you know, that they're supporting this technology.
They're probably going to be pushing those wonderful Sony 7.1 systems now so you can get your 7.1 system and your 1080p, you know, plasma screen TV and spend uber money on stuff that you probably don't need.
Screw that.
If you want something good, get a Harman Kardon and Bose surround speakers.
No contest.
That's what we've got in my house.
Anyway, um...
Something that actually is cool for some if you manage to get in on it and not so cool for others.
Amazon has sold out of pre-orders for the Wii.
Yep.
No more.
So go to your GameStop and wait until they do pre-orders.
Well, how long was that up?
An hour?
Two hours?
We probably had to shut that off pretty quick.
It was about a couple hours.
And the reason why they stopped pre-orders is because they don't have their allocations yet.
They don't know what they're getting.
So they're going to restart pre-orders once they figure that out.
It was kind of an error, I guess, on taking the pre-orders right now.
Well, I can tell you right now, at least as far as I've last asked, GameStop's not taking pre-orders on them yet.
Yeah, I've been calling them every day.
Because I'm annoying.
I ask my husband every day.
Do they know you by name when you call?
No, they don't, but I always preface the call with, I'm sorry to ask this, but, you know, because I'm sure they get the call, like 700 calls.
Don't you think news will hit the internet when they're going to start taking pre-orders?
Yeah, but I want to know first because I don't want to hear it from second hand because then people already know and they're already there.
I'd rather call them right when they open up and say, hey, are you taking pre-orders?
Okay, I'll tell you this.
As soon as I find out when GameStop is taking pre-orders, we will have an announcement.
So as soon as I can actually say something.
You think we'll be able to beat some of the big boys to it?
I don't know.
Maybe.
We'll see.
All right.
Seeing as how I hear all the drama that goes on.
Oh, you should share some of that drama with us.
I can't share some of the drama.
Damn, what kind of radio is that?
All right.
Well, one thing that's causing a little bit of drama, as you know, last week we talked about, oh, the Wii is region free.
Oh, it's not region free.
It's free, it's not free, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Well, it looks like there are plenty more votes for not region-free.
In fact, representatives from Nintendo of America confirmed to 1UP.com earlier this week that the Wii will be region-encoded by territory.
Wah, wah.
Which means, unfortunately, if you want to play Japanese Wii games, you will have to purchase a Japanese Wii or wait for a hack.
It will be there.
It will either be a physical one or something as simple as a disc.
Because it seems to me that if this is like a last-minute decision by them, that it's going to be something half-assed for the reason of protection.
I really don't see why they're putting so much effort into it since they've never really given half a crap before because it's always been something easy.
Anyway, Nintendo, if you're listening, Reggie, if you're listening to our podcast...
Why?
You know what?
And here's evidence.
If Nintendo is listening to this, here's evidence that Region Free will work.
Elite Beat Agents.
I will bet you anything that game sells like hotcakes.
Why?
Because so many people purchased the import version and let their friends play it that I bet that game is going to sell like crazy.
Wouldn't have happened if you didn't have the Region Free DS.
That wouldn't have happened.
And I bet you Elite Beat Agents possibly wouldn't have even come out here.
It would make more sense to have a universal launch, have the same games come out, except for the really crappy American-centered games and the really quirky Japanese-centered games.
I think that region coding is pretty much going to shoot them in the ass.
It hasn't worked yet.
It's interesting because some folks in the chat room are saying, you know what?
I still don't believe it.
So what if this big, foofy website called their rep at Nintendo?
Reps have been wrong before.
Interesting.
So I guess there is a little bit of hope that perhaps this system could possibly still be region-free.
I hope so.
Reggie, if you're listening, I love you, dude.
Please make it region-free.
I don't think... It'd be nice, but I don't think they will.
I don't know.
We'll see.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and cutesy Elebits and Pokemon.
No, no, no, it's Grand Theft Auto.
Oh, wait, no, I'm sorry.
I thought you were talking about Nintendo.
Nintendo's usually known for the cutesy games.
There is nothing I want more in this world to be able to beat a hooker with a Wiimote.
That is going to be the... I will be able to die after doing that.
You probably will.
What they need to add is like, you know, Pimp Slap with the Wii Remote.
I mean, it'll be just awesome.
I cannot wait for, you know, them to actually put out something.
Although they're probably going to bring out fucking Table Tennis for the... Hey, now wait a minute, wait a minute.
Table Tennis with the Wii Con could be pretty rad.
Don't knock it until you've tried it.
That might be kind of fun.
I want Table Tennis Extreme where I can take off people's heads with the fucking ball.
That'd be cool.
We need freaking wire work ping pong.
You can do clips and shit with the ball.
I don't know.
But, you know, I'm glad at least they're opening it up for M-rated games to hopefully remove this kind of impression that Nintendo is only for kids.
Because I think this console would be a lot better if they just get past that.
and publishers realize, okay, this is going to appeal to everybody.
Including people that like to beat hookers with a stick.
GS191 in our chatroom says, oh great, hot coffee mod with Wiimote functionality.
What do you do?
Stroke the Wiimote?
Does it have a sensor on the side?
I don't think it has a sensor for that.
They'll have an attachment.
Gross.
Gross!
Gross!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
My first FU of the week.
It's actually a very serious matter.
I found out today that my cousin-in-law died from AIDS.
He developed pneumonia, fell into a coma two weeks ago, and they pulled life support today.
So I'd just like to say a big FU to communicable diseases and people who don't take proper precautions.
I don't know if that was his case, but I'm just saying...
Everybody, just please make sure either do it safely or don't do it at all.
Take the proper precautions.
Sorry to hear that.
Loki.
My FQs of the week, or I should say FQ of the week, goes to a local church actually nearby here.
There was a story that came out that they were, basically the city has
Told them that they cannot have their Christian rock bands come in anymore Because they have this thing going on during the weekends called Club Retro or some crap like that Where they have bands come in and stuff and they worship and whatever crap they do Anyways, so this has been going on for years now And they've received numerous complaints because they are too noisy So they have filed basically this thing saying that Well, you're running a nightclub
Basically in this church, and this area is not zoned for a nightclub Plus you are being too noisy and there's too much problem with littering You guys are praying too loud Exactly, and so they're doing this silent protest in front of the church Saying that this is unfair, that they're taking away their right to worship And I say they're fucking retarded Because they know exactly why they are being, you know
If you're worshipping someone who's omniscient and omnipresent, you can go, thanks God, and God will hear you.
You can raise a joyful noise unto the Lord, but don't do it to where your neighbors wake up.
I would like nothing more for them to lose their ability to actually have this rock band that would make me so super happy.
And that's probably what's going to happen.
Go government!
Wow.
We should get some emails on that one.
My FU of the week, I was going to do this big old thing, but I'm just going to pass this week.
I'm mad at a lot of things, but it's really none of your business.
So, that's it.
Drew Nami.
And finally, I'm sorry, I had to step in here real quick.
Fuck you, Microsoft, for your crappy vision camera.
Because I cannot focus this thing for... I bet you it's just defective.
It's just crap.
Alright, Drew Nami.
Alright, first of all, this game, games related FU.
FU to the fucking stealth segments in Dirge of Cerberus.
I fucking hate it when otherwise good action games
Suddenly lapses in this forced stealth segment.
Fuck it.
It sucks.
I hate stealth games.
I will never be good at a stealth game, so why force me into these stealth segments?
And second of all, FU2, the current arcade management at local Country Club Lane.
I went there yesterday with Dark Studio from Chatroom.
They had no less than five machines out of order, including In the Groove and several racing games.
Thanks for watching!
Let's get back into the gaming news, shall we?
Sure, and we have some news for our UK listeners.
The PAL version of Final Fantasy XII will be out in early 2007.
In the US, of course, the release date is October 31st.
But I think it's funny.
There's a quote by the Square Enix CEO of Europe.
John Yamamoto saying that it looks set to become one of the crowning glories of PlayStation 2.
That makes me laugh.
Because I don't really think that Final Fantasy XII is all that fantastic.
The battle system in it is kind of bizarre.
However, you can probably see videos of it online.
You play through as a princess and some dude hanging out with her to try to rescue their home.
And it has...
It's called Active Battle.
Fucking A, that's the exact same plot of Enchanted Arms right now, actually.
I swear to God, it is.
It has a real-time exploration and this active dimension battle thing.
Basically, you have this big line that comes from you to whatever your target is, and it's really stupid.
And then your command screen pops up, and you can do that.
You can switch your targets.
No, it doesn't work.
I liked it, FYI.
I tried really hard to give it a chance.
And I'm going to get the game.
But I also love Final Fantasy XI, and you thought you were going to go crazy.
I gave Final Fantasy XI a chance.
You did.
Did I make it to level 24, White Mage?
You did.
I know.
But you do talk a lot of shit about Final Fantasy XI.
Yeah, at least you tried it.
I'll give you that.
See, I have room to talk shit about people who abuse their White Mages.
White mages are people too!
Heal, please.
Fuck you.
Heal, please.
Port, please.
No, no, no, no, no.
Because, see, I decided... My last party, I got revenge.
I let our tank die, and then I killed all the critters.
Because I was subbing Black Mage.
You are a heal bot.
No, I'm not a heal bot.
I'm a Black Mage in disguise.
Heal, please.
Shut up!
Regen, please.
You know, that's why I will not... Please.
That is why I will not play Priests in Ragnarok.
Because, at least with a Priest in Ragnarok, you can do random teleports and drop people in glass time.
Okay, okay.
I've gotta agree with you on that.
When I played Ragnarok Online with you, what did I say to everyone?
I don't heal.
I'm a battle alkali.
Yep.
And now you can actually take Monk.
Yes, and that fucking kicks ass.
I should start playing... I am no one's heel box.
I'm going to start playing Ragnarok again because I have my level 50-something assassin.
Oh, I remember her.
Well, have fun.
Meanwhile, I'll be playing Final Fantasy XII.
Addict!
Traitor addict!
Before all our fans in Europe.
Sorry, guys.
And I'll still be playing World of Warcraft after my burnout wears off.
You are a TA.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Did I not say in Part A that I went back to WoW?
I haven't touched Final Fantasy XI in two weeks and Shane's very mad at me for that.
So give me that.
And then I'm going to play Final Fantasy XII.
I'm going to play it before our British friends.
Sorry, guys, but I just can't wait any longer.
I'll let you all know how it is, though.
And, yeah, that's it.
Well, damn, Rob, where MMOs are concerned, you can't do anything without pissing someone off, can you?
That means you're a bipolar MMO-er.
I guess.
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
Right?
All right.
You know what's interesting?
I love Final Fantasy so much, yet I still have not watched Final Fantasy VII Advent Children.
I don't know why, I just can't frickin' sit down for an hour and a half to watch it.
This you must do.
Well, anyway, actually, what's been going on is that at Tokyo Game Show, Square Enix has revealed a new version of Final Fantasy VII Advent Children with the subtitle, Complete, is going to be released.
It's...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Now I have to find somebody who owns a Blu-ray player or camp out and watch it at Best Buy or something on the TV there.
That's awesome.
I can't wait to see that.
Anyways, there's one thing we talked about last week, which was the Kingdom Hearts Final Mix.
That is actually going to be including a PlayStation 2 remake of Chain of Memories in it as well.
So you will be able to get some nice...
Chain of Memories is actually going on.
I can tell from experience, by the way, that Chain of Memories on a Game Boy Micro is a pain in the ass.
But now you can play it on PlayStation 2, nice and big and huge and all that good stuff.
I can play it on my Macro and play it at work.
I mean, at school.
It says the game's going to feature full 3D graphics as well as some event cutscenes that will feature the voices in Japanese, not English.
And it says they were kind of scarce on the details.
Saga Loves Us Saga Loves Us
Um, Sega of America.
No, they don't.
They haven't put out Jumbo Safari.
Hey, you know what?
They're bringing a Shining Force EXA to PS2.
Alright, I guess I can give that.
Yeah, I love Shining Force.
I have the old ones.
It's my new background network.
There's a screenshot from Shining Force EXA.
I need a Jumbo Safari background.
Charm, please assist.
It's going to be an action RPG, um...
it's going to be taking more of the strategy lean although they're not giving any major specifics on that and there is no release date yet announced but it's Shining Force hey Shining Force is awesome
Alright, well, one thing that's not so awesome is a lawsuit, especially when you're on the receiving end.
And this week, the Ant Commandos have been on the receiving end of a lawsuit.
The Ant Commandos are a California-based company that sells Guitar Hero peripherals, specifically a wireless guitar controller.
Well, guess what?
Red Octane has come in and sued their asses.
Yeah.
Yeah.
However, I will say this.
At one point, didn't Konami officially recognize Red Octane as like their, you know, their cool?
We recognize them as like a pad manufacturer.
I want to say at one point they did.
On top of that, no.
I'm almost positive.
Red Octane didn't.
Until In The Groove came out, then all bets were off.
Red Octane also didn't actually go and use the official DDR logo on their product.
They didn't say, we are doing this for Konami.
The Konami logo didn't show up anywhere on there.
I've seen these wireless guitar controllers, and I played one, and it's complete ass.
So, if I were Red Octane, and this company is going out using our logo and our name, and putting out this utter crap product, I would definitely sue.
And the other side of it is just stupid, too, because...
Rob, you had more to that, didn't you?
Yes, I will.
Kage in our chatroom, I just wanted to say, made it funny.
I heard they hired Edgeworth to rep the prosecution side.
Beep!
Objection!
Objection!
Beep!
All right.
Not even Von Karma can make that argument work.
Well, the Ant Commandos were not going to take this lying down, and with a name like Ant Commandos, you wouldn't expect them to.
Don't they sound pretty hardcore?
They sound like a shitty indie band.
I know.
Well, the Ant Commandos actually have countersued Red Octane and given this timeline as their proof.
1999, Topway Electrical Appliances, a part owner of TAC, patents...
The Magical Guitar Controller for Konami's Guitar Freaks.
The design had five fret buttons, very similar to what Guitar Hero has now.
2001 to 2004, the CEO of Red Octane, as well as the sales manager, made several visits to a Topway factory in China and inquired about the Magical Guitar Controller.
From 2001 to 2004, Red Octane purchased several hundred Magical Guitar Controllers.
And in 2005, Red Octane releases Guitar Hero with a controller that looks exactly like the Magical Guitar.
I can't say that because they licensed the body shape for their guitars from Gibson.
Hold it.
I see a little bit of a flaw here.
Why would you make a guitar controller with five fret buttons for a guitar freak which only has three?
There was an Emco game.
I never understood why they did that either.
Now we know.
I don't know if it was arcade only, though, but I think there was a Namco... I know there's a Namco arcade guitar game.
I went digging through their Japanese site one time and found this and some type of keyboard sim that they did, too, but I didn't know if they ever had a home version of that.
If they did, then that makes sense.
Of course, if they had a home version of it, we would have heard of it.
Interesting.
I don't know.
I mean, besides the fact that Red Octane used to make DDR pads, does anyone find this kind of funny that they're using almost the same terminology as the whole Indigroove DDR thing?
Yeah, but technically, is the Indigroove thing against them?
That's technically what Rockstar, but I think Red Octane may fall into that a little bit because they distribute the home version.
I want to say they got pulled into some addendum.
It's been so long since we covered that case now, and we haven't really heard a lot on it, which is a little bit odd.
Yeah.
Search the court doc system and see if anything new has come out recently because there might have been a quiet settlement or something.
Who knows?
I think it would be very interesting if there was.
I don't know.
I'd like to thank the chat room for sending me various Jumbo Safari pictures for use on my background.
I appreciate that, folks.
God, I love OLR chatters.
All right.
Well, another thing we love is OLR emailers.
And every week you send your emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Wow, um...
Game Soundtracks
And sometimes you can find these at your local comic book store, I found.
Actually sells, at least the local one here now sells, anime and video game import CDs.
They've actually been selling them for quite a few years here.
Yeah.
And you've also got conventions.
That's true.
Your conventions, you've got online ordering.
I've ordered CDs through Amazon, actually.
I order all my UK Guerrilla stuff on Amazon.
Hmm.
another PS that's on here I'm going to Granville Island on October 3rd if you can tell me some details about the cookie shop
I would gladly purchase some cookies for OLR as a 200th gift and buy some for myself.
All I remember is that the guy who sold it sold nothing but maple stuff, which I'm sure in Canada, you know, is probably pretty common, sorry.
But I just remember the guy was right near an entrance, he sold nothing but maple stuff, and he had cookies were on one side, and he would give a free sample if you wanted it.
I'll take a picture of the box and put it on the forums.
How's that?
And that'll give you something to look for.
Because I might still have the box somewhere.
Send us some if we pay shipping.
I just might.
I like maple cookies.
Yeah, maple's delicious.
I need something to remind me of Vancouver, because I want to go back, but I'm poor.
Well, we also had a nice article sent to us by Robway, and it's on Planet Xbox 360, which came first, the violence or the video game.
And there it is.
Sweet.
And as far as the next mail is concerned, kind of a long one.
Hooray, long emails.
This is actually from McFloyd.
It says, Dear OLR crew, I've been listening to your podcast for over a year and a half now, so I thought it was really about time I expressed my thoughts on the show.
Wow, that's really sweet.
Thank you.
DarkSakura.com
Thank you so much.
This next part actually has a lot of good insight.
I wanted to comment on the gaming laws and people against video gaming.
You guys are completely right.
This is a violation of our First Amendment rights.
If this is a free country, people have to have the right to express themselves however they want.
By banning one thing, issues for similar things will come up and from those issues from other issues.
What about violent or sexually explicit movies or music?
Are we going to ban those things and make it illegal for a minor to possess them at all or to view them?
The government has no right to control what we see, what we hear, what we do.
Also,
Also, as being allowed to buy violent video games to play them, what will they do instead?
I believe we'll end up with more violence in real life.
The adults who are trying to get these laws passed neither understand video games nor see how video games are developing and are blindly scared of this new trend of kids playing these games more and more.
Video games are actually becoming more and more active with such games as DDR Guitar Hero and the Wii controllers evolving from previous ideas.
Basically, the email goes a little bit further into the educational games like Brain Age, Civilization.
You're a fan of Civilization.
Good job.
Games that are, you know, helping.
I like this person a lot.
I'd say if you're going to high school and have this type of insight, I am looking forward to see what you're like at a high school.
Well, consider what he said his dad does, too.
He's a diplomat, so it's kind of interesting.
That makes this insight especially interesting, knowing that the dad is in this very political position.
I like what's said here.
Adults should understand that this is... Let me get back to where I was.
Adults should understand that this is...
Just the New Age of People and help children choose games that are appropriate, active, or even educational if need be, helping them understand the issues in the more violent games.
Video games are very different from what they experienced as children, and learning by doing is the best way.
So video games have a huge potential in not only letting people have fun, but in teaching the things that they'll remember much better.
And the last paragraph, I'll just read that, it says, Finally, although this is just a little late, congratulations on your 200 episodes, so Loki, DarkSakura, Sky, keep up the great work, and I'm looking forward to 200 more episodes.
We'll try.
I would actually, if you're listening, I hope you are, I would actually like your permission to put this one up on our forum.
Letter of the Week!
Letter of the Week!
and not just because they kissed our ass, but it helps.
It's a very well thought out email.
I have a question for anyone that's in the chat room that might have an Xbox Live Vision camera.
Is it fucking blurry as mine is?
Because seriously, I cannot focus this thing no matter what kind of light is in the room, no matter if it's trying to focus something far away, close, it does not matter.
It's so goddamn blurry.
Goddamn, here we are trying to say something nice about a listener and it all comes back to me, me, me, me, me, doesn't it, Loki?
Yes, it does.
You selfish ass.
I'm just curious.
I just can't.
I want this thing to work.
I do want it to work so I can play Uno and make funny faces at people and stuff like that.
But I can't do that until it's not blurry because I just look like a fucking ghost in this thing.
So that doesn't work.
And once again, SSJ100Matter said, Loki, it's your face.
It's not my face because I pointed at you too and you're still blurry.
So tough.
But I'm beautiful.
That's what you get for watching the videotape.
Seven days you're going to die.
God punishing you because you're complaining about the praisers at the church making a lot of noise.
But he was messing with that beforehand.
I don't understand how I can clean the lens seeing as I just opened this thing up.
I mean, how would it be dirty already?
Hey, email.
Email's nice.
Yes, email.
Hi, OLR.
Hi, listener.
This is from DNL.
Oh, okay.
We love you, DNL.
Happy episode 201.
I know that I didn't get a chance to wish you guys a happy 200, but the biggest part of reaching a milestone is the aftermath.
Though I've only been on the show once, live at B3, when I met Rob for the first time.
Was that when me and Megumi decided to run away?
I think so.
B3 was this big DDR tournament that took place at Pier 39 in San Francisco, and this was probably in about our second year of existence that we did the B3 thing.
We weren't quite to 100 yet, but we were definitely getting old.
Megumi and I were really hungry.
I'll tell you what...
Doing live radio coverage for two days straight takes a lot of talent that I'm not so sure we all have.
Seriously, I wish I had recordings of some of that old stuff, and I just might somewhere.
But I seem to recall there was one DDR tournament that we covered that Loki ended up sitting in the back and he's just going, Yeah...
So, DDR tournament going on.
There was somebody sitting in the back row of the microphone.
Yeah, for hours, and I had a cold.
Oh, God, that was so funny.
That was a shaft.
What's it?
That was a shaft.
I hated it.
I was busy with the tournament and the fried Twinkies.
But no, Megumi and I ended up leaving the tournament.
And by the way, not meaning to cut in on the email, I would also like to give Megumi and her fiancé congratulations on their upcoming wedding.
Yay weddings!
Yay everybody getting married but me!
I make no comment.
Being married is not all it's cracked up to be.
Anyway, I've been listening on and off for three years, but started listening regularly as soon as there was a podcast.
That's right from the very beginning.
And Rob, he's so nice.
I had only seen him twice before, both at competitions, but when we bumped into each other, literally, at the Dear Friends concert before E3 2004, and he remembered my name and even introduced me to the awesome VXJasonXV, the amazing mod.
And then there was Roscoe's, but enough with the reminiscing.
Cheers to another X amount of episodes.
Renee is just the cutest girl you'll ever meet.
I mean, she's adorable.
You need to come on the show, Renee.
I know you're listening.
You need to come on the show.
I just, I want to...
RAD We love our international friends.
The last one is from Ranma.
Yes, Ranchan has decided to email us, so I'm gonna go over the highlights of this email, okay?
Hi all, Ranma here.
Isn't that how he also greets us on Skype?
I think so.
You're on the show too damn much, Ranma.
I don't know.
No, I'm kidding.
What's he got to say?
We love Ranma.
Oh, we do.
I truly enjoyed episode 200 and I listened to it again on my way to work last week and I just have to say that you, Jamie, are truly a voice in the female gaming.
I have had a few female gamers on my friends list, but you by far are the most vocal and outspoken of them all.
That's just because I'm a bitch.
I truly respect you for that and don't ever lose that edge of yours.
Oh, thank you.
Anywho, there are a couple things I wanted to point out from a couple past episodes just in case I missed tonight's episode.
One, price of the Wii Remote.
I don't know why people are angry over the price.
The standard Xbox 360 pad is $50, and I don't hear anyone complain about that one.
The Wii Remote is more than just a controller.
It has more features than any other next-gen controller out there, and it's less expensive.
Two, Techno DDR Heaven.
So about two weeks ago, I was with my friends at South Street Seaport, and we heard some techno music.
My friend Carmen said, Is it wrong to think of DDR when hearing techno?
I replied, It's not wrong.
It's in the groove.
No, it's not wrong unless it's in the groove.
And we laughed and got closer, and the song was Heaven from DDR Max US 1, I think.
I figured you'd all get a laugh out of that.
That is pretty funny.
Three, Enchanted Arms Gay Voice.
Yes, Rob, I totally agree with that.
I was listening to...
FF12 Day I am excited about this and I will be there as Black Mage I will take pictures for all
5.
SNK new hardware.
What SNK needs to do is make better hardware technology.
Every time they make a game on their normal equipment, in less than three weeks after it's out, the ROMs of it are totally found online.
In my honest opinion, that's a major reason why they are losing money.
Yeah, true.
Although I was one of the people that paid $390 for KOF 2000, but...
Loki's I'm Staying In.
Thank you so much for playing that.
The song reminded me of how long I've been listening to you guys.
I truly thank Raichan for telling me about you guys.
I'm surprised we didn't get more emails on that.
Thank God.
I would guess that I have been listening since episode 50 or so.
And for a dial-up station, that was really good stream.
That back in the day we were.
7.
Dance Revolution.
After seeing it again, I say that it has already gotten old.
They had eliminated two teams.
The remaining three were doing new dance routines to the same techno dance beat as the first episode.
What Dance Revolution needs is to allow teams to dance and choreograph songs from any of the DDR games and maybe, just maybe, let the Slumber Party girls cover a B4U track.
Well, that's all for now.
I'll try to call in if I can.
If not, have a great episode 201.
And by the way, wouldn't this be like the fifth season of OLR Live?
Oh, and Rob, I am used to that we can plan out SkyCon in October.
I'm still looking forward to that.
I think we kind of dropped the whole distinguishing seasons thing.
I can tell you that behind the scenes we've been trying to iron out a new website, and probably with that will come some very superficial type changes when it comes to art and logos and things of that nature.
But that won't be until probably the end of the year, going on into 2007.
But we know our website is not the best website.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Tell XM to pick us up.
I mean, that's it for email.
Sweet.
Well, thank you, emailers.
Send us more.
Mailbag at Orangelandradio.com.
You guys rock.
And we'll let Rob read it all.
Well, there's some pretty cool stuff coming out from Tokyo Game Show from Namco Bandai.
And it's about this game that used to be called Trusty Bell, or at least it's Trusty Bell in Japan.
Now it's coming over here as Eternal Sonata, which...
It's a pretty cool looking RPG.
Isn't this the one where you're in Chopin's mind or something like that?
Yeah.
Oh god, that game looks weird, but cool.
Yeah, so we'll be seeing that probably next year at some point.
I'm kind of glad they're having the faith to port that over.
But I would like more information on Blue Dragon US port, please.
Okay, thanks.
I want a remake of Blue Dragon.
How is Blue Dragon nowhere in our show world tonight?
Okay, I want to say something about Blue Dragon then, right now.
Okay, there were lines like 90 minutes long to see Blue Dragon over at the Tokyo Game Show, which isn't a surprise.
Well, it is a surprise when you consider it's an Xbox 360 game and this is Japan.
But when you consider that, you know, remember when it was big, you know, turn heads that some of the people behind Final Fantasy had gone over to the Xbox side?
Well, this is the game.
You know, this is the big game.
And I'll tell you what, from the previews I saw, it looks pretty hot.
I can't wait to play it, so...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Microsoft has said that they are going to waive the cost of repairs on Xbox 360 consoles that were manufactured before January 1st, 2006 and refund any fees already paid.
They were basically doing an analysis of the repair and basically it was the initial manufacturing run of the machine.
They've determined where a lot of problems are.
and they keep having them come in from that.
They said that it was a higher rate than what they are happy with.
So they've decided to comp repairs for any of the consoles manufactured before January 1st, 2006 and do those refunds.
I'd say you probably have to contact Microsoft Technical Support.
They did actually, though, say that they've rejected claims of an unusually high hardware failure rate.
So...
Well, good for Microsoft for doing the right thing with this, I think, because I think to charge somebody for these broken systems just because their 90-day warranty was up was kind of mean.
But I think the window needs to be extended a little bit.
I bought my Xbox 360 in February, and that thing broke right away.
And I would be pissed if I was right on the bubble there January, February, and mine broke.
I think it's obvious that there were still some production problems into the earlier year.
So thank you, Microsoft, for taking a step in the right direction.
Now take one more.
In my opinion, they need to.
Anyway, quick story, kind of relating to Xbox 360.
The official Xbox magazine ran a promo from Circuit City, and Circuit City was giving away this coupon that said that they were going to be offering 15% off of 99 Nights and Gears of War.
Hey, pretty cool, except for the fact that the coupon was set to expire October 31st.
So while you could get 15% off 99 nights, that thing won't do you a damn bit of good when it comes to Gears of War because Gears of War is not coming out until November.
Well, just so you know, a clarification has arrived.
And this, by the way, didn't make Circus City look good because there was that whole story a couple weeks ago about the one in San Diego that was offering to
You know, install the backwards compatibility on your Xbox for a fee.
I'm surprised it wasn't the best buy.
That was so messed up.
But anyway, so Circuit City, ooh, really having to dig themselves out a hole.
And they are.
Official Xbox Magazine sent something out that said Circuit City is aware that the coupon in the November issue is messed up.
They're going to publish another coupon in the next issue of Official Xbox Magazine that will extend the promotion through the end of November, I believe it was.
So.
That's pretty cool, Elise.
That's nice of them.
And also, speaking of nice of people to do something for us, SNK finally got their head out of their butt.
We are going to be getting a new King of Fighters with a complete visual overhaul.
New sprites.
Finally.
Because I remember sitting back and playing, like, what is it, KOF 2001.
It was the same old Kyo.
We have Kula, you know, with everything.
It's like, no.
They finally have listened to us, and there actually is speculation that it's going to be high-res sprites like in the Guilty Gear series.
We can only hope that certain other publishers of ongoing 2D fighting series listen to us.
Capcom, please.
That's kind of hot that finally King of Fighters is getting some new sprites, because...
Loki likes to bitch on every episode, and I'll admit I've done it too.
With some of these games like Metal Slug and King of Fighters, they have not changed the graphics one damn bit in the past ten years.
So someone at SNK has been listening.
You know what I would like to see?
I would like to see the KOF series get the Street Fighter 3 treatment.
With the extra animations and...
All that.
Well, that's the thing about Metal Slug, actually.
One of the things they announced this week was that the Metal Slug Anthology is going to be including Metal Slug 6 as well.
And will it have new graphics?
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.
But it has Metal Slug 6.
I mean, that's got to be different than Metal Slug 5 or 4 or 3 or 2 or 1.
I'm not going to knock Metal Slug.
It is a good game, and getting six of them at one price is not going to be a bad deal.
But I think if they're going to make another standalone one, you might want to up the graphics to the new... Please don't hear me wrong.
A game doesn't have to have the greatest graphics in the world to be a good game.
But, you know, if the technology's there, is it that hard?
to change it and make it a little nicer looking?
I don't know.
I'm not expecting to be blown away.
I don't need Halo 3, Gears of War-style graphics.
I just want, you know... Well, I even remember back in the day when Mugen was having its big day, there were actually people going in and retouching a lot of sprites from old games and making completely new fighters with the Mugen engine.
I don't know.
I think it's kind of weird that, you know,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
because apparently they're having trouble with it.
It's only listed as about 50% complete right now at Tokyo Game Show, and it's not very good, seeing as it's supposed to be released in a few months.
Ouch.
Yeah.
So that's official.
They've delayed it until 2007.
Yeah, and this has actually been confirmed by a Sony Computer Entertainment Japan fact sheet that it's confirmed as a summer 2007 release.
So, um, you know, with that out of the way, you know, I guess there are only, there's not a lot of launch titles.
Well, at least you're getting Ridge Racer 7, which does look pretty hot.
Ridge Racer 7 is 100% complete, so yeah, you will be getting that launch.
So, and actually, that's one of the first titles that's actually being released, you know, because they usually release titles before the console launches, and that's actually one of the first ones that come out.
Good job, Namco.
Good job.
Well, you might have heard during this week some dates get announced before they were supposed to, among other things, from Ubisoft.
That's because somebody found a 2GB archive file on the FTP server that had information, video, artwork, and screens from all the upcoming roster of Ubisoft titles.
Whoops!
meaning that they discovered Far Cry Wii, Lost, Naruto, Open Season, Rainbow Six Vegas, Splinter Cell 4, Surf's Up, Shaun White Snowboarding, Star Wars Lethal Alliance on PSP, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Assassin's Creed.
There were also some previously unannounced games that were in this RAR file.
A brand new Prince of Persia, which seems to be something we've actually mentioned on this program previously,
and Splinter Cell Games and Far Cry and Rocky on the PSP.
You know, it's so funny because I thought Rocky had already been announced.
I've had actually a sell sheet for Rocky for about a couple weeks.
I didn't know there was an announce.
It's hard for me to keep track.
Oh, well.
But yeah, Rocky's coming out.
All right.
Anyway, now that was a very interesting find on the internet, and DarkSakura likes to surf the internet up and down to make interesting finds of her own.
And she'll share them with you each and every week.
I sure will!
In this segment called the Website of the Week.
And no, it's not the Arcade Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
My website of the week is actually an official website and anyone who's been reading my live journal and listening to me go into fangasms over this the website of the week is the official Doctor Who website on the BBC website because I love Doctor Who if you go to bbc.co.uk slash Doctor Who you will go to the fantastic site where there's lots of wallpaper with David Tennant all over it and Billy Piper all over it
and K9 and Sarah Jane and everybody and downloadable mobile phone stuff and it's actually better than just about any of the fan sites I've seen and there is even a link to the classic series too with a what is the TARDIS tutorial as someone who has grown up with Doctor Who as a constant squee fangasm fangirl yep, I'm proud of it
Doctor Who Doctor Who Doctor Who Doctor Who Doctor Who
and Torino.
Calling them the Xbox Killers makes them sound like they go into people's houses at night like ninjas and cut the cords from the Xbox and smash it with a hammer while everyone's sleeping and then leaves the house silently.
Well, anyways, they were sentenced to death.
So, yeah, apparently they murdered six people in 2004 and...
Yeah, now they're dead.
What exactly did they do?
They murdered them over an Xbox, or what?
Well, that's what they assumed, because I guess, you know, they stole an Xbox.
It says the murders were vicious, blood being found on the floors and ceilings and the walls, and the victims were not only bludgeoned to death, but were mutilated afterwards.
And it says, you know, basically, you know, the killer... Oh, never mind, that's another story where they're talking about that person who killed their...
Child over the Xbox thing too.
A lot of people causing violence over an Xbox.
I don't know.
I think the Wii will be so easily accessible to this kind of stuff.
Especially when you get those third party controllers or something in shape like a samurai sword or actually a samurai sword.
Oh, that'd be cool.
Samurai sword.
You can kill people.
Or hookers.
You're just waiting for that with the Wii, aren't you?
Yes.
All right.
Anyway, that's just about going to wrap it up for news tonight.
So that means it's time for us to take your Skype calls.
And you can call us by visiting www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
Click on Interact With Us.
Or you can call us 916-226-9067.
But please keep in mind that is not a toll-free number.
I can say, however, we are looking into our ever-awesome webmaster, Jason, is looking into some toll-free options for us.
There may be something coming in the very near future.
Wouldn't that make a lot of you folks very happy?
Let's go to the phones.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
RavensDolphin.
Hi, RavensDolphin.
What's on your mind, buddy?
You know that Xbox serial killer?
Yeah.
It reminds me of this episode of the Boondocks when we were like, we gotta find the Xbox killer.
We have to find him.
You have to set that up for me a little bit.
You have to pardon my ignorance, but I don't watch a whole lot of TV.
So what's the show about?
Wait, is that the cartoon one that's...
Yeah, it's on Adult Swim.
I think I've seen a clip of it.
All right, the show is a suburban... These are African-Americans that is out of their unit, and they go to, like, suburban life, and see Huey and Dewey, and they go on adventures.
And this episode involved a guy going to jail because he got murdered over an Xbox, and he went like, They're gonna raid me!
They're gonna raid me!
You gotta do something!
He went like, hold on.
Was this before or after the real-life Xbox killer?
Oh, before.
Way before.
Hmm.
Interesting.
Interesting.
So is it possible that this show, maybe this person should be called the Boondocks Killer?
I think so, because that's what makes me laugh about it.
I'm like, oh God, this reminds me of that episode.
Interesting reality mirroring fiction.
Kind of sad, though.
Regardless of what inspired it, these people should have known better.
Period.
Yeah.
Anything else on your mind, my friend?
Two more things.
Okay.
I got a bone to pick with you, Sky.
What?
Last time when I talked to you about a DS Lite, you said run it over with a car and I would get a black one.
I did?
I probably did.
Yeah, you said buy the warranty and run it over with a car.
Oh, wait, I don't think I said that.
I think Miklatov said it.
Maybe I did.
I don't know.
Fine.
Whoever who said it, I still had to pay 50 bucks for the black one.
Did you seriously go and run over it with a car?
No, thank God it had a hairline fracture.
Oh, okay.
I was like, oh my God, please don't tell me you actually went and ran over with a car.
No, I would be sad.
I'd like to see someone who did that.
You know, Walmart's return policy might let you do that.
Oh, Walmart, you can return anything at Walmart.
It doesn't matter if it's there.
Somebody in chat had brought that up earlier, so it just made me think of that.
The whole Walmart return policy is so liberal.
Okay.
What's the other thing?
Do you hold Christmas to a high regard?
Because when I listen to Orange Lounge Radio for a year, it feels like Christmas is nothing, just another day.
I hold Boxing Day in high regard.
You know, I'll tell you what, in my personal family life, we don't have the whole big deal Christmas thing.
We will do something on Christmas morning, but that's about it.
And there's no children really in the family.
We're kind of a small family unit, so it's not the big deal it is for some families.
DarkSakura, are you going to require an Elvira Pinball game?
Because I love that game on the Atari Lynx.
Yes, I own that.
Elvira Pinball.
That would be hot.
You need to do that.
Make that happen.
I've seen an Elvira Pinball recently because I know some people who own one.
Isn't that the one that had the lower playing field?
It's been so long, Dark.
I'm sorry.
I do believe, because I've seen one.
I did see an Elvira pinball.
The place that we got our last action hero from, I think, had an Elvira pinball in their little repair place.
The last time I saw an Elvira machine was in Chico, where I went to school.
Actually, next on our list is actually a Doctor Who pinball machine for me and a Medieval Madness.
What about... I know this is so random.
What about an Austin Power one?
That one holds fond memories with me, too.
It's a fun one.
One I wouldn't mind.
Although, I actually found... Dan found a place in town that has a Pirates of the Caribbean machine.
One of the new Stern machines.
I want to play that.
It's $4,000, though.
I don't have that.
Yeah.
Yeah, you can only get them new.
Although, from what I understand, the licensing to put out some of the prototype machines that Capcom had out, like Big Bang Bar, from what I understand, I think Stern acquired the licensing to release those now.
I'll have to find that out for sure.
Yeah, would you?
Definitely.
As soon as I find that out, I'll make it public knowledge.
All right.
Oh, Let's Party.
That was a great staple.
All right.
As much as I'd love to reminisce about pinball all night, we've got other calls we've got to get to.
All right.
Raven's Dolphin.
That's it.
All right.
Have a good night.
You too.
Bye.
See ya.
All right.
Let's go to another call.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, this is Anoush.
Hi, Anoush.
What's on your mind?
Hey, I was just wondering if you guys heard about that software update that Microsoft's going to release for the 360 that's going to
Output 1080p
Well, aren't they going to upscale movies or something?
Movies and stuff will be upscaled, and games will be upscaled to 1080p.
You can do 1080p with a VGA cable.
But now Sony's come back and kind of poo-pooing that statement going, oh, but it's not native 1080, they're just upscaling things.
Yeah, but if games are programmed to 1080p, they will play it natively at 1080p.
Interesting.
Yeah, they're saying, oh, they're not natively 1080p.
Well, yeah, neither are some of your games, so shut the hell up.
Anush, I'll ask you, what do you think about the news?
It doesn't really make sense to me, because wouldn't they put some kind of digital output on it, like HDMI?
Well, technically, can't components handle 1080p?
It's just not as... I mean, I don't know enough about video specs.
They don't need HDMI to do 1080p.
It's just, HDMI is going to be required when they digitally sign...
when the broadcast flag goes into effect in a few years.
Why do I need HDMI over component?
Is it just that much clearer of a picture like component over S-video?
I believe so.
And also, I'm not sure.
I can't remember if component can do 1080p.
I think it can.
I need to read up on Wikipedia.
But I know HDMI, though, the big thing, and I think this is kind of one of the reasons why they added it to the lower-end PS3 model, too, is so that they can
Support the broadcast flag for the movies and stuff, because otherwise, in 2009 or whenever this broadcast flag goes into effect...
All your movies are going to be dropped down to 540p and that's the highest they will go if you're watching Blu-ray.
Jeremy Todd 1 has an interesting comment in chat.
I'm sick of all this 1080p versus 1080i bullshit.
95% of people won't even be able to tell the difference between the two.
This is just an e-penis sort of thing.
It is.
Basically, you're not going to notice the difference unless you have a TV that's over like 48 inches and you're sitting 6 feet away.
Anoush, do you own any next-gen systems yet?
Are you planning on purchasing any of them?
Yeah, I think I might go for a Wii and a PS3.
A Wii and a PS3, so this doesn't sway you, being somebody who wants to get a PS3, this doesn't sway you in Xbox's direction any?
I kind of swore not to get an Xbox.
Ooh, why's this?
Totally against Microsoft.
Okay, okay.
Well, I know a lot of people who are in that camp, they just really don't want to... You know, I used to be in that camp too, but I gotta say, there were just... Some of the games towards the end of the first Xbox run really finally convinced me that I needed to check it out, and I've been pretty happy with it.
You know what I say.
The system is only as good as the games that are on it.
Let me guess, Anoush, are you a role-playing type fan?
Like, those are your types of games, the games that Microsoft kind of lacks on?
Not really.
I'm more into racing games and FPS.
Interesting.
And you still don't like Xbox 360 because that's pretty much all they have right now.
That's true.
Okay, interesting.
Well, I mean, you're free to like what you like.
There's no problem.
But I was just kind of curious on your thoughts on how 1080p might sway your thoughts on that one way or the other.
It wasn't really the 1080p that makes me want the PS3.
It's more of a fanboy thing.
Okay, okay, so...
Well, that's funny.
What games are you looking forward to on PS3?
Gran Turismo HD.
From what you guys said, I'm kind of swaying against that now.
Yeah, I was going to say, what does this whole microtransactions thing do to your opinion on that?
I'm kind of thinking that maybe Sony will give you a points card with the game.
I hope so.
And you can download whatever you like.
Like so many points.
We'll see.
You know what's funny is that a lot of people are talking about Wii 60 was this big thing.
People were going to get the Wii 60.
And now I missed it.
Gohan in chat is saying it should be Wii S3.
So you're in the Wii S3 camp.
Yeah, I guess so.
All right.
Sounds good.
Go register WiiS3.com before someone else does.
Okay.
All right, Anush.
Take care.
Yeah, you too.
Bye-bye.
Thanks.
Let's go to another call.
Let's go to this call.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
Holy crap, you scared the crap out of me, it's DMN.
Boo!
Hi, DMN!
Ah!
What's on your mind?
Um, actually something you guys haven't talked about today.
His skull is on his mind.
The totally unprofessional comments about Sony calling the Xbox 360's HD DVD drive quote-unquote unfortunate.
I don't have the link to the article handy, but basically Sony said your HD DVD drive sucks and we're better in a very unprofessional sort of way, yet very businesslike.
Everybody's just waving their cocks around, I mean...
The marketplace will choose the ultimate victor and then I believe bragging rights can be bestowed.
But yeah, it's just they're talking trash because they're trying to talk their own thing up because it's coming out soon.
But I don't know.
I'm going to be perfectly honest with you.
My friend and I went into a Best Buy this week and finally, after all this time, I got to see an HD DVD and a Blu-ray side by side.
And I'll tell you what.
I have to say I think the Blu-ray did look a little better.
But there are some other factors to take into consideration here because, you know, my friend who is with me, David, said, you know, the other TV is kind of crappy and plus they're playing Ultraviolet on the Blu-ray, which is, you know, a movie as crappy as the movie is, I'm sure, is meant to look very stylish and cool.
Whereas over here you're getting like the Manchurian Candidate or something that's not really, you know, action-packed.
So I don't know.
But my first impression did tell me that, you know what, Blu-ray was a little prettier.
Blu-ray is a little prettier, but a little pricier.
Like, HD DVD players, I think, run at the cheapest around $500, whereas Blu-rays are like $1,000.
This is beta versus VHS all over again.
All over again.
You know, I read somewhere, and I think we had to cut it from our show roll, but Loki, maybe you'd remember this, because I think you were the one that posted it in our super secret thread.
Something about...
Some company was going to be making discs that did both HD, DVD, and Blu-ray.
It's Warner.
They patented technology, I guess.
It's DVD, Blu-ray, and HD all in one.
Smart.
And I imagine they're going to use it for their movies.
Smart.
So no matter what format it goes, they're supporting it.
I think that's a great idea.
Yeah.
I wish this whole format war thing would end and just come up with something.
We'll see what happens.
Anything else you want to say, DMN?
You're cutting out there, my friend.
There you go.
Sorry, I was rubbing my face.
I just posted a link in the chatroom if anybody wants to take a look at that.
What is it?
Gamespot.something.
I don't care.
Well, I know, but what is it that I'm going to look at if I pull this up?
It's the article regarding Sony talking their shit.
Well, this is close to launch.
Who wouldn't want to whip it out?
Dave Karacker, Senior Director of Corporate Communications for Sony Computer Entertainment America
Sony realizes that to truly take gaming into the next generation requires a larger data format for both games and movies.
PS3 uses the Blu-ray format for gaming, giving developers 50GB of high-definition storage on a single disc, while Microsoft's 9GB DVD gaming format is an obstacle for storing HD content.
Sounds like typical cock-waving to me.
I mean, it's not like he said, God, the 360's a piece of shit.
True.
This is more the point and laugh tactic.
Yeah, this is just more trying to emphasize what's good about theirs and how it outshines the other one.
Yeah.
Well, that was about it.
You guys have a good night.
All right, you too, buddy.
Thanks for the topic.
All right, bye-bye.
Bye.
Wow, callers are calling in with lots of good things we should have been thinking about earlier.
Let's do one more call.
I know some other folks are trying to get through, but we've got to wrap it up here pretty soon.
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio.
Who's this?
Hi, you're a little bit quiet.
Try to get a little closer to your mic if you can and tell us what's on your mind.
Yeah, my mic's a little quiet.
What's on your mind?
24, the game.
Oh, 24, the game.
What about it?
It's pretty good.
Is this something you just picked up this week?
No, I won it.
Oh, that's right.
Okay, well, it's a pretty good game?
The game's okay, but the cutscenes are pretty good.
Yeah?
How is it if you're a fan of the show?
Oh, if you're a fan of the show, you definitely gotta try it.
Yeah?
What kind of game is it?
For those that don't know what to expect out of 24, the game, what kind of game could you compare it to?
It's a third-person shooter.
There's a few mini-games in it, and there's some really crappy driving in it.
Really crappy driving in it?
Yeah, it's the worst driving I've ever played, but the rest of it's pretty good.
All right, awesome.
Well, I'm glad you've had a chance to check that out.
You're a little bit quiet, so I've got to keep this short, but is there anything else you want to share with our listeners?
Not really.
All right, well, have a good one and enjoy the game.
Yeah, see you.
Bye-bye.
Little mini game review there on the Skype line.
That's what it's for.
You guys can call in and tell us your thoughts on things.
We appreciate it.
Sorry to those folks that didn't get through tonight.
I'll have to try again next week.
What can I say?
Any other last-minute stories here in studio?
In other news, I'm still awesome.
Was anyone ever questioning that, DarkSakura?
No, I just have to keep, you know, making a mention.
But if you disagree, send us an email.
If you disagree, keep it to yourself.
All right.
Anything from you, Loki?
Okay.
I'm trying to think.
I know there was some other stuff I had.
I'm looking real quick here because I shut down my list because I suck.
I'm trying to think here.
Let's see.
Great radio.
Yeah, I think we might have to wrap it up if you don't have anything.
Okay, here we go.
Well, a couple of small things.
There was a couple of stories.
First off, no PlayStation 2 version of Grand Theft Auto Vice City stories coming out.
None at all?
None at all.
Really?
which is interesting and then what was the other one I was going to say oh yeah they're working on a new Metal Gear Solid digital comic based on Metal Gear Solid 2 in Japan so that would be pretty cool and what was the other one oh Square's working on Front Mission for the DS so that should be pretty neat hmm
I have some news actually for our UK listeners.
What's up?
Anyone who is looking for Football Manager 2007, there's a demo being released on Sunday, 1st October for PC, Mac, and Intel Mac.
To quote on here, the vanilla version will include English and Scottish quick starts, English language only, with limited assets, logo and player pictures, etc.,
This will be available from the News of the World website in conjunction with Play.com to try and maximize the bandwidth available.
The link to this will, of course, be on SIGames.com when it's released at midnight.
The Strawberry version, that's kind of funny, will include extra quick starts and extra languages to be confirmed with more assets.
This will be available initially as a torrent only.
Also at midnight from www.SIGames.com.
So, if anyone's interested in that.
Speaking of London or the UK listeners, there's actually going to be a London's Game Festival kicking off on October 2nd.
It runs through the 7th.
You're going to be able to play tons of games.
That's a long festival, five days.
Yeah, you're going to be able to play tons of games at a special setup at Oxford Street's HMV.
Plus there's going to be various other events and venues and showcases going on around the same time.
Some other fun things to note, at Tokyo Game Show they were showing off some different colored PSPs.
One including a camo, as well as red, yellow, and green PSPs.
Or, I'm sorry, red, blue, and yellow PSPs.
All with metallic sheens to them.
And another fun one I thought of, Devil May Cry is being made into an anime.
Should be interesting.
That should be pretty cool.
Alright, well, it's about time we wrap up this program for tonight and wait till next week for more gaming news.
Let's go around, though, first and get everyone's final thought.
Drew Nami, thanks again for being here as always.
What's your final thought?
Food.
Alright.
Loki, your final thought?
My final thought is, and I forgot to mention, Unreal Tournament 2007 for the PlayStation 3 will support mods.
Hot.
DarkSakura, your final thought?
Food.
I've eaten nothing but bagels today.
My final thought is cookies.
I did cookies.
I brought cookies.
All right.
