14290	25598	Tonight, September 3rd, 2006, Loki brings us new exclusives from the inside, PlayStation 3 gets a new slogan, and an old computer classic makes its way to the Nintendo DS.
27600	36727	Orange Lounge Radio Hello everybody and welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
36787	39809	We are that video game independent podcast dedicated...
40151	41912	to what gamers really want to know.
42012	45012	Video game news, gamer culture, the gamer lifestyle.
45473	46293	It's all right here.
46393	47953	And I'm here to help you through that.
47993	48974	My name is Rob Roberts.
48994	49954	You might know me as Sky.
49994	53895	And also here to help us out, say hello to Loki, Techmaster.
54155	54275	Hello.
54295	55095	How are you doing?
55636	56056	I'm okay.
56196	56656	All right, good.
57296	59137	DarkSakura is not here tonight.
59497	61957	She is celebrating her anniversary this weekend.
62357	63818	They got married on September 1st.
64540	70743	So a big congratulations and happy first wedding anniversary wishes to DarkSakura and Dan the Man, her husband.
71303	75085	Filling in tonight, say hello to an old Orange Lounge Radio favorite, Miklatov!
75405	75845	Hello.
76005	76505	How you doing?
76865	77486	I'm fine.
77666	78506	Alright, sounds good.
79146	81607	Well, let's not waste a moment here.
81667	83948	Let's get right into How Is Your Gaming Week?
84369	89851	And we're going to start it off with Loki tonight to tell us about his gaming week, when the games he's been playing and what he likes, what he hates.
90875	94219	I've been playing, well, lots of Saints Row because that game's awesome.
95040	98424	I tried a little bit of the online and I think it's, I don't know.
99565	104511	The games that I played were very laggy to the point where they were pretty much unplayable.
104971	109236	It's going to be fun, though, when they get whatever that, you know, what's wrong with it worked out.
109756	110718	But in the meantime...
111761	112461	I don't know, it's okay.
112801	115082	I did discover that there are cheat codes in the game.
115222	121563	Granted, cheat codes you can't get achievements for, but it's fun during lunch hours, you know, and having infinite rockets.
122043	133445	So I've been keeping myself very occupied with that, and it's pretty cool driving around in a big rig and stuff and killing cops and people and just general mayhem.
135266	140987	And then other than that, I did try a little bit more of Rumble Roses XX, and I really don't like the game.
142042	143403	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
163450	165412	Thanks for watching!
180280	209410	3 waves of 12 planes and you have to do that for each plane that's in your collection which is there's 32 of them and it takes a very long time it's just it's not that it's impossible it's just so fucking boring and to be honest I don't know why they put that even in there because arcade mode is almost the same as this like mini campaign mode that they have it's just dumb it's a really really dumb game I'm sorry but it is and I do not recommend it for the PlayStation 3 or the Wii when it comes out no matter how you know
210495	211135	The Tooth Control
235885	240387	That was a cool mission, and I wish there was more of it in the game, but there's not.
240407	242068	There's only that one level, and that's it.
242548	245589	So, oh well, but it's a crappy game.
245689	249771	Now I have to introduce our always present fourth guest, and that is the chat room.
249791	255234	And if you're listening live on this Sunday night, head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on chat.
255714	260836	And let's see, it was JeremyTodd1 in chat said, Wait, he was complaining about it being boring.
261077	262837	If it's boring, why would you do god mode?
262877	263958	It would make it even more boring.
265168	265368	Why?
265388	268631	Because I want to get the game over as quick as possible because it is so boring.
269211	276157	You know, basically the whole game requires you to chase after these planes and you have to end up looping around shooting them, looping around shooting them again.
276777	280560	Imagine that for like, oh, trust me, the missions are long enough as it is.
280680	281901	I do not want to make them any longer.
283102	284804	So, I'm almost done with the game.
285164	286205	This is my last achievement.
286405	287266	I just need to get it done.
288687	289607	Then I'll be done with this game.
289648	290268	I can sell it back.
291729	292690	And then play more Ridge Racer.
293211	300393	It's a fun game and I really wish Ridge Racer 7 was coming out on the 360 but it's not.
300453	304835	Sadly enough, I saw the screenshots for Ridge Racer 7 and it makes me want to get a PS3.
306195	308996	Fuck you, Ridge Racer.
309276	311537	No wonder there's a lot of Ridge Racer love from Sony.
311577	312997	It could sell some systems there.
314318	316979	Think about that next time you tell some Ridge Racer jokes.
317079	318219	It really does sell systems.
318259	321120	It's really sad because seeing some of these screenshots of
321670	327871	Not necessarily the first party stuff that they showed at E3, but like Ridge Racer 7 and Fight Night Round 3.
328291	330091	It actually looks pretty good.
330152	331092	I mean, I don't know.
331132	334912	I'd have to see it actually being played, but we'll see.
334932	341554	So that's pretty much... Oh, and of course, as usual, the Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories.
341834	343654	We've been playing... We actually did some races.
344214	346174	They actually have racing and stuff, and that was pretty fun.
346294	349815	Which I should point out, you always have something new to complain about that game, yet you can't stop playing it.
351069	352770	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
380437	381137	and... Really?
381437	387418	I would have thought that it would have been like the reason why that game sells as well as it's doing is because of multiplayer.
388598	399740	If it weren't really boring, I'm sure it would be a really good multiplayer game but it kind of sucks a lot and maybe if you had more than three people like we had playing, you can play up to six.
401061	401901	That can make it fun.
402741	408662	But Enchanted Arms is really cool and I enjoy playing that and I've been playing Final Fantasy.
409522	411163	Leveling Blue Mage Even Final Fantasy XI?
411443	412023	Yes Specifically?
412504	419808	Like there are any other ones The rest of them are stupid Well there's a new one called Final Fantasy XII that a lot of people are really excited about You know what?
420068	423370	I don't care Alright That's not a real Final Fantasy game
426052	429334	Well, technically, yes, it is actually a real Final Fantasy game.
429374	430635	Not in my world!
430655	434037	Some would complain that it's actually more of a Final Fantasy game than XI was.
434157	440301	Yeah, there's chocobos, and red mages, and blue mages, and black mages, and white mages, and whatever else.
441302	442062	It's way more fun.
442262	445304	And red hearts, and green clovers, and purple horseshoes.
445524	446265	And blue moons.
446925	447405	They're cool.
447446	447966	They taste good.
448166	448726	Lucky charms.
449607	450928	I want some lucky charms now.
453359	453740	That's it.
453880	455381	I don't do anything else besides work.
473602	474123	I'm just kidding.
474163	476905	Obviously, you can't talk about what you're playing at work.
477425	478806	Oh, I can tell you what I'm playing at work.
479146	480708	Enchanted Arms.
480768	482709	That's what I'm playing at work.
483189	483730	Wait a minute.
483750	484971	That was by Ubisoft.
485391	489634	Well, it's on my TV a lot, so I guess I'm playing it.
489754	491996	I heard a really funny name for them.
492076	496199	Noobisoft was what I heard somebody call them this week, and I thought that was really funny for some reason.
496860	497220	Why?
497240	497580	I don't know.
497600	498141	It made me laugh.
498221	499422	I like Ubisoft.
499542	500082	I do, too.
500483	501583	Except, didn't they do...
503291	504972	That DDR urban game.
505253	505713	Flow?
505753	506173	Yeah, Flow.
506233	507574	Flow was kind of cool.
507835	508355	I played it.
508695	509416	It wasn't that bad.
509496	513859	It was not a great game, but it's way better than, like, I don't know, In the Groove.
513879	515841	Except for a couple songs.
515961	518463	Sephiroth1215, what do you think of this comment in our chatroom?
518663	520384	I ignored it, is what I thought about it.
520424	521325	No, I have to read it here.
521345	525608	Final Fantasy XI should have been called Final Fantasy Online and not by a number.
525888	528010	I actually said that when the game first came out.
528470	530312	As much as I love Final Fantasy XI, I actually agree.
530692	532915	Dragon Quest VIII Dragon Quest VIII Dragon Quest VIII
554136	557898	In response to Jeremy Todd's comment about how it's ironic that a couple weeks ago I said I wasn't a gamer, I'm still not.
557918	559459	I'm just, you know, I've got a bad addiction.
559839	560679	And so, you know, I need help.
575720	576000	All right.
576080	576661	And that's it.
576801	578282	JeremyTal1 in chat is also pointing.
578302	580584	Boy, you'd think he's the only one in chat with how much we're quoting him tonight.
581064	586368	He's saying that Ubisoft is also making Assassin's Creed, which was some news this week because, you know, it's coming out to the 360.
587129	587989	Shock and awe.
588049	588650	We all knew that.
588990	591112	Well, that was, like, totally unexpected.
591252	591532	Yeah.
592013	592873	It came out of nowhere.
594534	594835	Let's see.
594875	595575	MyGamingWeek.
595695	596036	Okay.
596943	598504	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
611874	612975	I am an enabler.
612995	614136	I'm really, really good at that stuff.
614156	615197	Did you not see my cute little chocobo?
615217	615837	He's so awesome.
615857	616138	Yeah, it's cute.
616158	617058	This is why you guys buy Macs, too.
617139	620001	I think one of our Link Shell buddies today put it best, though.
620021	620782	He said something about,
638683	641404	We were all looking at the total time spent in the game.
642004	645345	And, you know, Jazz, he's up to 198 days in the game.
646005	646985	Yeah, he's crazy.
647025	650006	And he says probably a quarter of that has been spent looking for party.
650606	653226	And that is the downside to Final Fantasy XI, big time.
653266	658287	You have to have a good link shell so that you have a chat room to keep you busy.
658347	661308	I mean, honestly, I missed a lot of the people in the chat room.
662808	664809	Chat room, the link shell on Final Fantasy XI, so...
665649	667190	I mean, that's a good reason to come back.
667590	670331	And the fact that I was playing the game is a good reason to come back.
670952	675334	And you know that doing all that crap last night to get you those quests was really fun, too.
675434	676794	Yeah, we did all the new job quests.
676814	680336	I got Blue Mage, Corsair, and Puppeteer all in one night, and it was actually kind of fun.
680716	681817	I will say this about the game, though.
681857	683778	They upped the graphics on Xbox 360.
683818	684638	They upped the resolution.
684678	685779	It's a slight change.
685899	689841	You may not even notice it, but I did, and I think it did make the game look a little better.
689921	691761	Still kind of hard to read the text.
692242	694723	Still takes forever to get logged into the game, but...
695103	695584	I'm having a good time
718232	725502	A. I will still be going to Phantasy Star Universe when that comes out, so Final Fantasy XI can kiss my butt while I go play Phantasy Star Universe for a while.
726122	731009	B. Did you hear me complain the 40 times she went back to Ragnarok Online?
731109	731730	Don't think so.
732170	734633	She quit and went back to WoW as well, so you know what?
734673	735614	We all have our things.
736676	737617	So, suck it.
737717	739158	I don't care what you people think.
739278	740378	I will game however I want.
741139	742479	Other games I've been playing this week.
742760	745541	Another game that I bought that a lot of people have been going, why would you buy that?
745621	747422	Time Pilot on Xbox Live Arcade.
747923	750804	Now look, this was one of my favorite 80s games.
751625	753946	Like, it was kind of like my cultish game that I really liked.
754046	754847	That and Gyruss.
755367	757028	I know they're both Konami games, just by coincidence.
757048	758689	Those are like the shooters that I absolutely love.
759096	762457	So I was really excited to see Time Pilot was coming out to the Xbox 360.
763078	765499	It's cool you can play with original graphics as well as enhanced.
765839	771141	The enhanced graphics aren't exactly going to, you know, rock your world by any means.
771221	775743	It's probably Super Nintendo-level graphics, but I mean, I guess it's kind of nice to have them.
776283	778704	Otherwise, the game has super easy achievements.
779324	785647	I probably got about eight achievements the first time I played through the game, but maybe that's just because I played it before, so I kind of, you know, was already decent at it.
787466	790288	So I don't think there's going to be a lot here that's going to win a person over.
790328	790628	I mean, it's $5.
791569	792389	It's not that expensive.
792610	793991	I would say check out the demo.
794491	802997	If you like those Geometry Wars-ish shooting games and you want another easy-to-pick-up shooter, or you're an achievement points whore, I think Time Pilot's pretty decent.
803257	804037	I think it's worth a look.
804918	808620	I think the game that they're putting out next week, though, Scramble, I think I'm going to totally pass on that one.
808640	810862	That was not a Konami game, I remember, by any means.
811322	814384	I think Gradius should have been the one we're getting instead, but that's just me.
814524	815465	Maybe they're waiting on that one.
815505	815805	I don't know.
816286	816566	Whatever.
818376	820520	And then the other game I played this week was Enchanted Arms.
821262	822605	I didn't like the game at first.
822865	824448	Well, it's not that I didn't like it.
824529	827074	I thought it was just like a real average RPG.
827114	829479	And I was kind of like, okay, am I only liking this because...
829912	831253	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
854970	858694	I don't think it's as good as it could be, but I think a lot of the cutscenes are really, really good.
858755	860817	I think a lot of the battle, though, looks like PlayStation 2.
861137	862679	And some of the graphic stuff annoys me.
862739	867404	Like, if you use big characters in your party, sometimes it blocks other characters.
867424	868185	You can't even see them.
868546	872891	Some very basic camera controls could have been put into battle to make it a lot easier to see.
873849	875249	English Voice Acting English Voice Acting
895560	896441	Thanks for watching!
914038	941250	basically you move around a 12 square grid and put in your attacks and you kind of have to think about where your characters are positioned might make it easier for the enemy to attack you so it's somewhat tactical but still old fashioned style as well there's a lot of customization ability kind of has a Pokemon-ish element in it because there's a hundred different golem creatures you can use the story started off very cliche and it's still a little bit cliche as far as Japanese RPGs go but it's getting better I find that if you stay with the game
941790	950195	Up until about, there's a major event that happens about two hours into the game that has a really gorgeous cutscene with it, and I think the game gets a lot better after that point.
950855	955578	I wanted to ask this, though, because I am a gay gamer, and Miklatov, I know you are too.
956138	965263	The game's getting a lot of talk because it has a gay character in it named Makoto, and Makoto is very, let's say, flamboyant.
965484	969386	Imagine Carson, the blonde guy from Queer Eye, who's like a bard character.
969406	971267	He plays sax or something, and
972270	973411	He talks like this.
973451	978154	He talks like James from Pokemon, if you've ever watched that show.
978554	979335	And I'm like, wow.
979355	979955	No, he doesn't.
979975	980636	Yes, he does.
980676	981556	He totally has a voice.
981636	984358	If anything, he talks more like Xander from Drawn Together.
984658	985839	Okay, well, what do you think of this?
985879	988721	Do you think it's a good thing for gay gamers?
988761	990282	Do you think it sets us back two years?
990642	991123	What do you think?
991143	992023	It's a bad thing.
992384	998768	But I don't like him, but I like how they're...
999209	1001331	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1028167	1029548	It's not one way or the other.
1029788	1046935	But I think it's very interesting and a very risky thing to do in an Xbox 360 game, because you think of the typical, stereotypical Xbox audience, Madden 07 and all that stuff, and I think it would be very shocking, and I can imagine a lot of people going, ew, ew, ew, gross, but I think they need that.
1047615	1048576	I think they need that.
1048636	1048956	I don't know.
1049756	1050977	But I think it's kind of neat.
1053073	1058535	It's a step in the right direction, even if the character was done a little over the top, to put it lightly.
1059155	1060316	I think it's a good thing, overall.
1061576	1064177	Can I do a spoiler?
1064517	1064677	No.
1065137	1065838	Jerk.
1066098	1068519	Blaze in our chatroom says, that's how the world should be.
1069199	1069519	I agree.
1070290	1073072	So, you know, maybe it's a utopia view of the world.
1073172	1073453	I don't know.
1073633	1075955	But anyway, those are the games I've been playing this week.
1076435	1078877	I do kind of recommend Enchanted Arms.
1078977	1084221	I think if you're into Japanese RPGs and you own an Xbox 360, you really should take a look at this game.
1084582	1088525	But if you haven't really played these types of games before, I don't think this is the one that's going to win you over.
1088865	1092508	But I think this is a good one to appease fans of Japanese RPGs.
1093649	1096792	Alright, let's get into some housekeeping news tonight.
1097232	1097712	First off...
1098664	1102865	I know some of you folks might be listening tonight for the DDR Power Previews, which we were promoting.
1102905	1109966	And if you've noticed on OrangeLawnTrader.com, we were requested earlier this week by Konami to suspend that for the time being.
1110006	1113707	Some things are going on behind the scenes where they just weren't ready for us to do that.
1114147	1121689	So we're hoping that, and I don't know why, there's a million reasons we can theorize, but long story short, it's just not happening tonight.
1122472	1129094	The good news is it does look like we will be getting to debut some type of new tracks from Ultramix 4 and Universe.
1129814	1132275	Konami of Hawaii has been really good in working with us.
1132655	1136156	I think we will have something possibly as soon as next week.
1136416	1137636	So keep your eyes peeled on the website.
1137716	1140157	I do think it's going to happen in one form or another.
1140177	1145578	And you will hear new songs that you have not heard yet here on Orange Launch Radio and over on allgames.com.
1145658	1146679	So stay tuned to the website.
1147059	1150140	I apologize for anyone that was tuning in ready to hear it tonight.
1150280	1151120	These things happen.
1151564	1152465	Other housekeeping news.
1152745	1153425	It is a 3 day weekend.
1177865	1182379	and uh... if you've been in our chat room tonight you'll know that Loki and myself have started the drinking tonight
1184039	1185600	A few things I want to say about drunk shows.
1186220	1192402	A, we do this because we can, because people out there say, oh, professionals shouldn't drink while we're on the job.
1192422	1196163	Well, we're not professionals, and we're perfectly fine with that, so shove it.
1196543	1200204	And the other thing is that people say, wait a minute, Rob, aren't you being a little bit of a hypocrite?
1200244	1206026	Because last week you were saying you were criticizing those folks that had gone to the press event and were drinking at the press event.
1206226	1207607	Well, there's a big difference here, you see.
1208127	1210288	That's because they were drinking in someone else's house.
1210988	1217394	If we were guests on, let's say, Scott's show, Bobby's show, whatever podcast we want to have us on, Loki, do you think we'd go on their show drunk?
1217794	1219396	No, unless they were doing it.
1219476	1220497	No, unless they asked us to.
1220917	1224901	But really, we would probably not do that.
1225021	1227864	We would have the respect to be our professional self.
1228084	1230566	But while we're in our own house, we can do whatever we want.
1231007	1232108	So that's the difference.
1233603	1235885	If you want to call us a hypocrite after hearing that, whatever, I don't care.
1255075	1255856	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1278733	1286818	All I drink, for those who don't know, is screwdrivers, except tonight I've actually switched with Rob, he's drinking screwdrivers and I'm drinking some watermelon thing.
1287999	1294203	Even that is pretty tough for me to drink, and it's just all mental right now, so I'm not trying to overdo it at all.
1294603	1299146	In fact, I'm pretty sure I'm probably not going to get too drunk tonight, so whatever, I mean.
1301329	1302290	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1322103	1325344	I've just known people who've had a problem in my past, and it's not an easy thing to deal with.
1325364	1330205	You know, the other thing I was thinking about bringing over, but I didn't, I was going to get drunk off a kosher wine.
1330385	1331365	Which would have been funny.
1331565	1332245	That would have been funny.
1332926	1333226	All right.
1333846	1337367	Anyway, let's get into some gaming news, shall we?
1337727	1338507	Yes, we shall.
1338727	1340547	And we have some exclusives tonight, right, Loki?
1340588	1341548	We have lots of stuff.
1341708	1342048	Awesome.
1342088	1342568	What happened?
1342608	1344228	How did you land so many exclusives this week?
1344428	1350850	Well, once a year, and actually we started this last year, we have the game publishers out to basically give us their rundown of the fourth quarter.
1351567	1352949	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1371388	1375911	So, starting things off here, which is actually kind of cool.
1376332	1378313	This year, for the first time, we had Nintendo come out.
1378833	1383477	So, obviously, the question on everyone's mind, when the hell is Wii coming out?
1383517	1384037	When is this coming out?
1384418	1388080	And to be honest, the guy was very tight-lipped about it, except for a few things.
1389932	1393014	It is most definitely going to be announced on the 14th.
1393294	1401200	He said it's actually going to be announced in Japan as well at the same time, which is kind of funny because the news story came out afterwards about that same.
1401260	1404142	I was going to say it lines up with a story that came out later this week.
1404162	1407865	He said they're going to have multi-regional press events, so that makes sense.
1408545	1411067	He has confirmed, though, it is going to be a November launch.
1411467	1413649	He said 100% a November launch.
1414708	1416589	This is based on his knowledge, what he knows so far.
1417210	1417390	Ouch.
1417570	1421212	So, the October 18th date that we were so certain of just got shot down this week.
1421933	1422593	What went wrong?
1422834	1424254	Why were we wrong on October 18th?
1424335	1429758	We were wrong because the launch right now, he doesn't know exactly when it is.
1429978	1435242	It's November, but they're trying to time it either two weeks before the PS3 launch or a week after.
1435482	1438684	Because they don't want their thunder being stolen by Sony.
1439004	1440285	So, wait, wait, wait.
1440465	1444488	You're telling me Nintendo themselves doesn't even know when they're launching this system as of yet.
1445089	1448151	Well, he hasn't been told the final date yet.
1448352	1451515	The reason why is they're waiting on the amount of units that they have in production.
1451555	1455098	They're making sure that they have enough to launch because they're doing a worldwide launch.
1455698	1457140	And that's pretty much it.
1457700	1461944	But it will not delay the launch past Thanksgiving.
1462565	1464246	So it will be before...
1465310	1467451	That gives you a pretty good range there of when it's going to be.
1467591	1478415	So if Nintendo themselves doesn't even know the launch date, or at least maybe a very, very few select people know it at this point inside Nintendo, would it be safe to say that any story you've read on the internet about launch date today is bullshit?
1478995	1480055	Including the one we ran.
1480455	1480635	Yeah.
1481235	1481456	Okay.
1482076	1486137	And remember, mine was just purely speculation because of the anniversary and all that stuff.
1486157	1490859	But that would make sense because if Nintendo themselves has kind of not really known the date they wanted to do...
1491710	1492932	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1507951	1510354	And to be honest, I would think that they're not launching in November.
1510434	1516640	It makes sense because you want to make sure you have the most units so you can sell as much as possible so you don't run into the shortages.
1517321	1518442	Some interesting stuff, though.
1518482	1521105	They are spending $30 million in marketing this thing.
1521125	1522827	That's twice as much as the GameCube.
1524148	1525230	So it's definitely going to be out there.
1525290	1531738	They're not going to have in-store kiosks because the reason why they're not is because of the setup issues with this thing.
1532118	1537966	Because it has that sensor bar, it would make it very difficult for them to be able to set up and they want to make sure that they have
1538376	1539216	Thanks for watching!
1557066	1558107	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1577288	1578529	There is one interesting thing.
1578589	1581210	They're going the Xbox route with the DVD player in it.
1581290	1584111	It's going to be an add-on and not included in the box.
1584211	1589073	So you've got to get this extra dongle or whatever to put on it to be able to play DVDs.
1589173	1593495	But his thought on it was, who doesn't own a DVD player by now?
1593655	1595735	I mean, seriously, everybody owns a DVD player.
1595835	1596496	It's not a big deal.
1596616	1599217	So that's kind of neat.
1599637	1601578	Moving on from Nintendo a little bit...
1603783	1604303	to Midway.
1604683	1605944	And this was kind of interesting.
1606564	1609225	Has that DVD player rumor been announced anywhere?
1609385	1609725	I don't know.
1610345	1610725	Interesting.
1611305	1612986	Here's something interesting from Midway.
1613166	1615147	And I asked him twice when I heard this.
1615787	1618108	Blitz the League for the Wii is not coming out.
1618668	1619268	Not coming.
1619588	1620168	Not happening.
1620288	1621309	Definitely not at launch.
1621749	1623789	It is cancelled as far as they're concerned.
1623889	1625230	So, not happening.
1627151	1629891	They are basically concerned with launching Rampage.
1629931	1631352	Rampage, I guess, is going to be their big...
1632307	1632788	ActaVision
1648495	1651197	Guitar Hero 2 will be coming with a red guitar controller
1677418	1682724	Also, and I have asked him twice about this, because this didn't make sense, and I don't know, Shane, if you know anything about this.
1683144	1690693	He said that for Universe, all the songpacks from the Ultramix series will be transferable to Universe.
1694521	1695761	I've never heard that.
1696262	1699264	Yeah, that was interesting because I asked, I'm like, are you sure?
1699284	1700465	Yeah, how would that be possible?
1700925	1701365	Exactly.
1701445	1702386	That didn't make any sense to me.
1702546	1706349	I'm thinking this guy might have been confusing Ultramix 4 because that would make sense.
1706989	1710591	Oh, like maybe Ultramix 4 and Universe have the same songpacks or something.
1710792	1711092	Maybe.
1711252	1713713	Maybe they're going to have the same soundpacks later on.
1713753	1716015	But I asked him again, I'm like, are you sure?
1716315	1717476	I'm like, that seemed a little weird.
1717516	1721319	He said, yes, Universe will be able to play the songpacks from Ultramix.
1721639	1721859	I'm like,
1722399	1724520	Okay, so take that with a grain of salt.
1725201	1728182	Okay, DarkSakura brings up a good point in chatroom.
1728262	1731464	Ultramix 1 through 4 aren't on the backward compatibility list, so how would that work?
1732164	1732564	I don't know.
1733105	1735646	Unless they're planning on re-releasing the songpacks or something?
1735946	1738307	I don't know.
1738327	1738608	We'll see.
1741409	1744731	Anyways, let's see here.
1745671	1747152	According to Sega...
1748308	1753295	Fantasy Star Universe, on the 360 there will be no charge for the online service, which is pretty good.
1754017	1757562	There will be a charge, a monthly fee for PlayStation 2 and PC users.
1759302	1764164	It would almost be worth it for me to get a 360 again just to get PSU with no monthly charge.
1765705	1770348	The Secret of the Rings, or you might remember Sonic Wildfire, not a launch title for the Wii.
1770528	1774090	Coming March 2007, so look for that then.
1775111	1778873	There will not be Full Auto 2 on the Xbox 360 at all.
1779653	1782395	Not later, not ever.
1782535	1785756	Because the first one didn't sell very well, so they're not bringing it back.
1786137	1786597	Huh.
1788998	1792380	I wonder why they think that it'll sell on the PS3.
1792480	1793221	Well, they're not sure.
1793241	1794521	They're just trying a different audience.
1794742	1796523	So that's really what it is.
1796983	1806289	This is really weird because, I mean, in the scope of about five minutes, you've contradicted about seven different news stories that have ran out there previously.
1806909	1807209	I know.
1807430	1808030	What can I say?
1808130	1808530	Okay.
1808790	1810772	I hope you're right or we're going to look stupid.
1811752	1815855	Hey, these are from the... Okay, so marketing people could be wrong and therefore you're wrong.
1816255	1817036	LucasArts
1829329	1831189	The Wii Star Wars game is in development.
1831309	1833430	It will not be done until late 2007 or early 2008.
1833470	1838351	They want to make sure they get it right because they have a rabid fan base of Star Wars fans.
1839451	1841911	Obviously, they mix it with rabid Wii fans.
1842332	1845832	They want to make sure they don't fuck this up, so that's mainly the case.
1846272	1850473	The next-gen Star Wars game is going to be coming in the fall of 2007.
1850593	1854794	Also, Indiana Jones, the next-gen game, will be released at the same time as the new movie.
1855214	1857996	which is confirmed in pre-production from them.
1860357	1861058	Let's see here.
1862018	1873746	I had Vimvedi, they were talking about the Scarface game and one of the funny bits of trivia from it is that the voice actor that they picked for Tony Montana is actually Al Pacino's driver.
1874986	1879009	And apparently because Al Pacino can't do Tony's voice anymore due to his age,
1879642	1880884	Say hello to my little friend!
1890946	1895409	GT, that racing game that they announced, it's going to come with a steering wheel add-on for the Wii.
1895849	1899172	And this is going to be something that you plug... Like you put the Wii controller in the middle of it?
1899252	1899652	Yes, you do.
1899672	1900412	That is hot.
1900552	1902794	That is awesome.
1902974	1904055	You do not need it to play.
1904075	1905796	Could I use the A button for the horn?
1906076	1906516	Beep, beep.
1907397	1914501	You do not need it to play the game, but it will be just something that you can slap the controller into to play it, which I thought that was very cool.
1915182	1917463	Someone actually thinking about how to use the system.
1918084	1918164	Um...
1918993	1920035	Prince of Persia New Chariot Races
1930342	1934307	And right now the working title is just Prince of Persia, so they haven't really made an announcement yet.
1934467	1939012	Now for once, that lines up with something I did read on the rest of the internet a couple weeks ago.
1939473	1941796	That was actually the DS one that you were reading about, I think.
1942697	1945580	Far Cry and the Wii looks pretty awesome from what I've seen so far.
1945740	1949505	The pictures look pretty cool, the screenshots, so that was pretty neat.
1949745	1950045	Koei.
1950987	1953749	Bladestorm, The Hundred Years War, not coming out at launch.
1953789	1959253	It's going to be quarter one of 2007, and I guess it is in the launch window, but whatever.
1959694	1963417	Guitar-O-Man Lives is going to have online play and new songs.
1963557	1963977	That's hot.
1965218	1966259	Didn't that already come out?
1967460	1968661	In Europe?
1968701	1971043	Maybe in Europe, I don't know, but it's coming out October here.
1972283	1978068	New Romance of the Three Kingdoms game coming out on the PlayStation 2, quarter one or quarter two of 2007, which should be interesting.
1979141	1979701	Now the big one.
1980121	1980962	Microsoft.
1981762	1985063	No price drops, no bundles whatsoever for the 360.
1985103	1989164	They're not worried because their competition is $200 more expensive than them.
1989244	1997787	In fact, they were unaware that Canada, because Canada kind of operates a little bit independent than the U.S., Microsoft was doing a bundle until after it had been announced.
1998447	2001468	And much hate mail was exchanged, according to our rep.
2002388	2005429	Gears of War is coming out November 7th, not November 12th.
2005509	2008910	November 12th is actually Emergency, which is their big marketing push.
2012127	2014108	Wait, that makes absolutely no sense at all.
2014548	2020191	Why would they have all this huge hype over emergency, emergency, and then you're telling me the game's coming out five days earlier?
2020731	2024413	The game is coming out on the 7th because you can't really launch a game on a Wednesday.
2024453	2027094	That's when everybody's getting in the game is on the 7th.
2027574	2032377	Now, stores, you know, some stores are waiting until the 12th because they're confused on this emergency thing.
2033117	2037899	But the emergency is when they're going to be doing all the big ad pushes, you know, their campaigns.
2038019	2039460	They're playing with fame.
2039480	2041101	Because didn't Halo launch on a Friday?
2041321	2045962	So could it be like that where maybe the stores are getting it that day, but they're not supposed to sell it until the 12th?
2046242	2048183	No, according to him, they can sell it when they get it.
2048623	2053005	And this was also kind of ties in with another story that we had earlier about the same thing.
2053525	2058226	And I can confirm that it's always been the 7th, but I thought it was weird that they were selling it on a Sunday.
2060007	2061087	This is the best one right here.
2061547	2062308	Halo 3.
2062848	2064588	Now, everybody thinks it's coming out in the fall of 2007.
2064628	2064668	No.
2066949	2067650	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2091172	2094093	It's going to be March or April of 2007.
2095033	2096013	It's not going to be the fall.
2096193	2098474	If I was a betting man, I'd say it's the end of spring.
2099734	2100654	Okay, but you know what?
2100934	2102334	That doesn't sound like he knew for sure.
2102354	2104815	Because he says, if I was a betting man, I would da-da-da-da.
2106215	2111896	Why would you launch a game in April, especially before E3 or whatever?
2112177	2114277	Well, here's my thought on it.
2114297	2116998	Even though E3 is the same thing next year.
2117098	2119078	This makes perfect sense when you think about it this way.
2120815	2121976	I'm Not Sure About Microsoft
2141360	2143583	Thanks for watching!
2160677	2163260	Atari, Alone in the Dark Test Drive Unlimited
2177574	2179035	Which is coming out actually next week.
2179335	2181375	We'll be getting download packs each month.
2181816	2184797	They're planned up until June of next year so far.
2185577	2187698	The first two packs will be Lexus cars.
2188018	2189418	It says no word off these cars.
2189478	2190299	They're going to be free.
2190559	2194360	But Lexus paid a quarter million dollars to get the cars in the game.
2194960	2201142	And it says all the download packs will range from free to $7.99 or the Microsoft equivalent in points.
2202583	2204504	That's all the big news from our wonderful...
2206302	2206622	Meetings.
2206762	2208743	You know, Nintendo Maniac 64 has a good point.
2208783	2209863	PSP came out in March.
2211164	2212344	It's the end of their fiscal year.
2213365	2216386	I mean, I would think that they would wait until the fall.
2216546	2220827	But then again, maybe they want to make sure that people... Think about this.
2222007	2225609	Microsoft is doing something big around the PlayStation 3 launch.
2225709	2227829	Just some sort of announcement or event.
2228430	2230850	What if that announcement is that Halo is coming out in March?
2231091	2235152	Then people that were going to buy PlayStation 3, they're going to wait until this game comes out.
2237008	2238829	That's... That's it.
2239230	2239650	Wow.
2241411	2246154	So, maybe that's just the liquor talking, but that makes a lot of sense now that you've put it that way.
2247055	2252358	So, okay, would you say if November goes by and we still haven't heard anything that maybe something's up?
2252899	2259643	I think if they're going to announce anything, it's going to be a big... It's going to be... A Halo 3 announcement, I mean, is going to be huge, but... I don't know.
2259883	2261244	I mean, it makes sense.
2261304	2265267	I mean, you would... Because people are like, well, there's... You know, Gears of War is awesome, but...
2266028	2266749	I really want Halo 3.
2267570	2270635	I might be getting a PlayStation 3 because Resistance looks pretty good.
2271616	2273499	Oh, by the way, Halo's coming out in a few months.
2273519	2275161	People are like, okay, I can wait.
2276262	2278125	Or I'll buy a 360 now.
2278425	2278966	That kind of thing.
2279947	2280268	I don't know.
2280308	2282331	That would be just downright evil, but kind of funny.
2283482	2292527	Well, didn't they say that they were going to... Well, they always were saying that they were going to release Halo 3 on the... Yeah, but I think then everybody realized realistically that can't happen.
2292947	2294408	If Halo 3 is going to be really good.
2294748	2294969	Yeah.
2295609	2295929	Wow.
2295989	2297230	I don't know, but... Alright, we'll see.
2297750	2299051	I mean, I don't know.
2299091	2303593	Take it with a grain of salt, but that's straight from the mouths of people that are working for these companies.
2304974	2307936	You know... Turbopunk in chat.
2307996	2308656	Pure evil.
2308836	2311458	I'd expect no less from Macroshaft.
2313039	2313199	So...
2314048	2314388	I don't know.
2314968	2315709	It was interesting.
2315749	2316649	We were very excited.
2316929	2319190	I tried to get more out of the Microsoft guy.
2319210	2321671	He kind of wanted to talk about stuff that had already come out.
2321691	2322791	I don't know.
2323031	2323372	He's weird.
2324472	2324772	Wow.
2326053	2327233	Lots of juicy tidbits there.
2327253	2328053	We'll see what happens.
2328073	2333475	We will post all this stuff in that thread that we have going, the Under the Radar thread.
2333536	2337437	So you'll have that for reference in case this stuff actually... Or he's wrong.
2337457	2338697	Or he's downright wrong.
2338718	2339678	Yeah, whatever.
2340218	2341759	All right, well, this is coming from salespeople.
2341879	2342199	Or, I mean...
2342819	2343359	Yeah, sales?
2343660	2345061	Sales people, yeah.
2345141	2353746	Alright, well, one thing we do know about Xbox Live Arcade is that we have this new game that's going to be coming out, and it's called Space Giraffe.
2354187	2362972	Now, usually I'd laugh at a game called Space Giraffe, but what looks pretty awesome about it is that it looks a lot like Tempest, but a lot trippy, kind of like how Geometry Wars was.
2363373	2368896	Now, I remember seeing a screenshot for this game that had a lot of really dirty words on it, but I can't seem to find that anymore.
2368916	2369557	I remember that one, yeah.
2369697	2371278	I don't know if that was photoshopped or what, but...
2371698	2371918	No?
2371938	2373799	That's disgusting.
2373859	2381524	I hope... Because there were some words in there that actually offended me, and that's hard to do, so hopefully those aren't actually in the game, but we'll see.
2382224	2382985	That's kind of interesting.
2383005	2386407	Yeah, there were some pictures posted on LiveJournal or something like that, so that would be pretty cool.
2386847	2387627	I love Tempest 2000.
2388087	2388868	I think it's one of the, like,
2389557	2395738	Biggest Sleeper Hits that people don't appreciate and was like the reason to own a Jaguar was that game.
2396058	2397499	So, there you have it.
2397719	2401239	I'd be very happy if a game like this came to Xbox Live Arcade more as it develops.
2402520	2408121	There was also a story this week talking about the Xbox 360 soccer exclusive deals that they have going on.
2408461	2418403	Talking about how the Xbox 360 is going to be the only place that you're going to be able to get next-gen soccer games or all next-gen soccer games I should say because FIFA is going to be on both systems and
2419824	2422848	Pro Evolution Soccer 6 Winning 11 Pro Evolution Soccer 2007
2433656	2440422	According to Konami, who was also at our event this week, spoke to the rep there.
2440822	2455735	The reason why Pro Evolution Soccer, or Winning Eleven, whatever, Pro Evolution Soccer 2007, the reason it's not coming out on the PlayStation 3 at launch is because they haven't got the final dev kits yet, and because the game's not getting done until March.
2456796	2459358	Or actually, as late as May, according to him.
2460439	2460679	So...
2462028	2464753	Yeah, it's only exclusive because it's not finished.
2466035	2467758	So, take it as you will, but...
2468888	2469188	I don't know.
2469648	2469869	Hmm.
2470429	2470789	Interesting.
2471610	2480915	Well, one... I don't remember them saying anything at the barbecue about it being exclusive or anything, and I would have thought if it was going to be exclusive, they would have said something like that.
2481756	2487620	And it seemed like they were... I mean, the game was being ported to DS... What else was there?
2487640	2488380	PSP.
2488760	2490862	And it seemed like they were porting it to other systems anyway.
2490982	2494584	I mean, sure, for the handhelds, they'd be downgraded versions, but... Well...
2496495	2504400	Think about it, if they didn't really assign an exclusive deal, and I'm not sure FIFA's coming out on the PlayStation 3, I would figure it is, but maybe not this year, I don't know.
2504800	2519270	If that's the case, then there is no soccer game on the... Now, wait, okay, hold on a minute here, because the guy from Microsoft at the Germany convention went out there and said, we have both franchises exclusive.
2520090	2521851	So you're saying, no.
2522592	2525474	Well, according to my rep, but then again, you know, he may be,
2526548	2527149	I don't know.
2528651	2530754	I'm just taking Konami's word for it.
2530774	2531375	What can I say?
2531715	2532136	Interesting.
2532697	2533558	Okay.
2533618	2533959	I don't know.
2534139	2534820	It's kind of weird.
2535831	2540312	Well, here's one game we know is not going to be exclusive to either system and shouldn't be a shock at all.
2540332	2541753	There is a Burnout 5 coming.
2542133	2542973	Oh my god, really?
2543173	2544194	No, that doesn't make any sense.
2544414	2549495	And it's coming to the 360 and the PlayStation 3, who would have thought, sometime in 2007.
2549795	2553437	Now, Burnout is going to be getting a little bit of a makeover.
2553477	2555837	It's not just going to be rehash of the old same old Burnout.
2556237	2557278	Thank you, EA.
2558098	2562060	Now, this time Burnout will be more of an open-world-ish environment.
2562140	2570363	Players will be able to go in and out of menus at every intersection, possibly a crash course by going through any type of intersection.
2571003	2573624	It's going to be taking place in a town called Paradise City.
2574424	2576165	Take me down to the Paradise City.
2576445	2577886	Sorry, I just can't help but think of that song.
2578726	2580006	Why isn't it coming out for the Wii?
2580887	2581287	No ideas.
2582754	2583535	No ideas.
2584155	2588938	They also say, though, EA says, the most explosive pileups in the series history.
2589759	2591460	They're always going to say that.
2591560	2594042	It is kind of the first true next-gen burnout.
2594062	2596464	I mean, the other one was just a souped-up old burnout.
2596964	2597404	Pretty much.
2597545	2599186	Yeah, that's not a big surprise there.
2599646	2604630	Well, what's interesting, though, Microsoft Japan is talking about bringing Tokyo Game Show and Exo 6 home.
2608909	2624457	Um, kind of like, it sounds like what they're doing, or what they did with E3, how they had, you know, a bunch of exclusive, like, video and demos and stuff, and I really hope they do that, because, you know, with the region-free, uh, you know, those logins that we have, you can download some pretty cool demos.
2624977	2636203	But, um, yeah, so there'll be, um, more of that stuff coming, um, around Tokyo Game Show, which is actually only in a few weeks, I mean, uh, 23rd to 24th of September, so, um, should be pretty cool.
2639266	2639726	and so on.
2664315	2668638	On This Day or Days because of the, you know, dateline and all that stuff, messing everything up.
2669438	2673601	And then, of course, it kind of goes on into the Tokyo Game Show.
2673941	2677403	But what should be noted, Nintendo usually doesn't attend Tokyo Game Show.
2677503	2682126	So this might be their way of kind of doing it on their own terms of publicity.
2682206	2683507	So yeah, not a big surprise.
2684447	2685648	It's not not a huge surprise.
2686392	2690655	What was a pretty big surprise, though, was Microsoft released another backwards compatibility update.
2691275	2693897	And there was quite a few titles this time, actually.
2694177	2698460	They even had some pretty good stuff, like Burnout 3 and Dead the Rights.
2699060	2702623	Right after I sold back Burnout 3, thank you, Microsoft.
2702663	2703243	Sure.
2703343	2710308	Fetal Frame 2, Freaky Flyers, if you were into that game, Gauntlet Seven Sorrows, Sid Meier's Pirates.
2711028	2712229	and so on and so forth.
2739486	2740587	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2769063	2771485	Barbie fits the same scheme.
2771585	2772965	Go to old Nintendo emulators.
2773045	2776728	Once you make a certain mapper work, most of the other games that run on that mapper work.
2776828	2778308	Well, here's something interesting.
2778849	2785192	I was talking actually with Midway about, hey, did you guys know that this game has got to add to the compatibility list today?
2785492	2789495	They're like, no, I didn't hear that, but I'm not surprised.
2789695	2792036	And they're like, well, we actually know what engine it's built on.
2792076	2794077	It's built on the LA Rush engine, believe it or not.
2794658	2796799	So they're talking about maybe...
2797588	2798909	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2818886	2821067	I guess not, but I don't think he'd mind me sharing.
2821107	2827410	He linked me to a story on GoNintendo.com which talks about the demo unit, which we talked about a little bit ago for the Wii.
2827870	2833792	And apparently, according to GoNintendo, the picture has turned out to be true due to numerous sources who have informed me.
2833872	2838154	The same image shows up in a packet sent out to EB GameStop employees to get them ready for the unit.
2838614	2840215	I'm glad to hear that it turned out to be real.
2840315	2841316	I really like the look of it.
2842976	2843597	I think the whole...
2844923	2849224	To be honest, the guys said Street Cruise were the way they were going to demo it, not the units.
2850185	2851785	I mean, I don't know.
2852525	2854386	Could that mean a reduction in the units?
2854606	2860528	I think it was going to be harder to do maybe the retail units just because of the setup that's needed for them.
2860568	2863949	Maybe he was talking about the promotional marketing stuff.
2863969	2865250	They're not doing demo units like that.
2866110	2870111	We know that EBs and GameStop have the in-store units that they always have.
2870251	2871372	And to be honest, you guys,
2873274	2874055	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2892614	2892994	Psychonauts
2915646	2916347	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2928118	2929958	Loki, why don't you start us off tonight?
2958633	2987056	F you at these drinks taking like ass no offense I mean it's kind of like you know watermelon thing don't make it too strong um I don't know mainly my F you this week goes to people that do not pay attention on the road and who cannot park and I swear to god every time I see someone on a cell phone I know that they're gonna be driving like shit and you can always tell you know these people they're you know veering in and out of lanes going slow
2987469	3017229	you know can't seem to follow the road at all and then you drive past them you see they're yapping away on the cell phone well fuck them also these people that fucking do not take the time to park their cars correctly you know you get into a parking complex that doesn't have a lot of parking and then all of a sudden you see oh Jackass is over the line he's taken up two spaces because his fucking Yukon or whatever is too big for a compact space well fuck them for trying to park in these goddamn small spaces
3019625	3021126	Anyways, to you Rob.
3022586	3026548	My FU of the week goes to busyness.
3026668	3031410	I've been like crazy busy with all this stuff going on and I've had like zero free time.
3031951	3034712	Especially when it comes to my work life is mostly what I'm talking about here.
3035272	3036593	My work life has just been nuts.
3036853	3042435	And FU to having this feeling because this is how I felt.
3042475	3043536	This is kind of a work story.
3045357	3045997	FU to...
3046815	3054398	Folks that like to leave carrots on the ground, and then you kind of hop up to that carrot to take a little bite, and then BAM!
3054418	3055638	The net comes out and grabs you.
3055658	3057699	What kind of work do you do?
3058839	3059860	I'm hunting wabbits.
3060100	3061120	Are you a furry?
3061520	3062341	No, gross.
3063041	3063901	Miklatov, your turn.
3064241	3065802	I don't have an FU of the week.
3065882	3067042	Well then F you to Miklatov.
3067263	3069723	F you to me for not having an FU of this week.
3069743	3073765	How about F you to Miklatov for fucking suckering me back into Final Fantasy XI and it's...
3074395	3079479	It's awesome, because the day that you started, you're like, you're not going to get me to play this.
3079519	3080620	I'm like, we'll see.
3080980	3092728	And I didn't even have to coerce you that much, and you're just like, you wanted to check out how the graphics were on the 360 update, and we couldn't get mine to log in, so you had to log in, you had to pay for it, and then you just started playing, and it was great.
3093289	3093709	I hate you.
3094629	3095770	And I'm the best.
3096050	3102335	Well, thanks to Final Fantasy XI, here's a game I haven't been playing a lot of on Xbox Live this week, but I did get it patched.
3102708	3103349	Thanks for watching!
3122272	3125574	It discourages people from backing out at all if someone's going to get a loss.
3125914	3127535	So no backing out of the game early.
3127955	3132838	And I think they also address some of those timeout issues and connection things with this patch.
3133198	3135359	And reset the leaderboards.
3135739	3139081	Why can't they just have a counter for disconnects?
3139591	3140952	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3169540	3172884	Will I get achievement points for playing it?
3181823	3184204	Yeah, well then I think I'd be okay with that.
3213425	3219094	Alright, well, speculation abounds here on the internet about Windows Vista.
3219595	3227026	And usually we don't talk about a lot of non-gaming news, but this is kind of relevant because folks do their gamings on PC.
3227367	3228529	And I know we don't talk enough about...
3229209	3232052	And you also have DirectX 10, which is going to be fucking awesome for gaming.
3232112	3236256	Right, and I'm just saying, we don't talk a lot about PC games on this show, and I apologize for that.
3236316	3237717	It's just we're so busy with consoles.
3237977	3245604	But we do try to talk about big things in the computer gaming world, and this would certainly be one of them, even if it is about an operating system, and it's about Windows Vista.
3246105	3251510	Now, apparently Microsoft Canada actually spilled the beans on their website about how much
3251730	3252351	Vista Home Basic
3275309	3275689	and 26993.
3276530	3284395	It should be noted that Microsoft Canada has since removed the listing and they said, quote, a number of pricing models are undergoing consideration internally.
3284716	3286137	However, nothing has been finalized.
3286197	3290700	Microsoft is currently finalizing its pricing model and will have more to share at a later date.
3290860	3293642	Man, I'm starting to get the impression that Microsoft Canada is kind of retarded.
3295263	3298825	Just because of the whole, you know, they did the bundle thing when they weren't supposed to and all that other stuff?
3298965	3299266	Yeah.
3299446	3300006	Well, I don't know.
3300026	3302228	That kind of makes them cool that they're doing stuff when they're not supposed to.
3302548	3303428	I don't think that makes them retarded.
3303448	3304189	I think it makes them great.
3305439	3305839	I don't know.
3305979	3306379	Whatever.
3306399	3308060	I think it's kind of funny.
3308820	3315402	Or maybe it's just because I'm still having those residual I'm going to move to Canada someday feelings because I just, I love Vancouver so much.
3315442	3315942	What can I say?
3315982	3316382	Whatever.
3316702	3316962	Alright.
3317362	3330366	Well, we love you guys who choose to email us every week so much and we like to read your emails and even though DarkSakura is not here this week, that's not going to prevent me from borrowing her gear and jumping into the mailbag at mailbag at orange launch radio dot com.
3332774	3337299	Email numero uno comes to us tonight from somebody from Vancouver, Canada.
3337399	3338100	Go figure.
3338760	3339941	Actually, Vancouver Island.
3340042	3340722	There's a difference.
3341183	3342624	You see the island is out.
3342784	3343405	Anyway, forget it.
3344426	3345968	This comes to us from Wyatt.
3347353	3349916	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3365074	3366155	DarkSakura's butt-kicking-ness
3381087	3386110	Thanks a lot for what you do for us loyal listeners, and here's for years more of the same.
3401667	3402027	P.S.
3402588	3404569	Sky, you should come to Canada more often.
3404609	3414956	If you think that the maple syrup cookies sold on Granville Island are good, you should try the... I don't know what they're called, but basically they are maple syrup thrown into snow and then eaten like a piece of maple syrup thrown in the snow.
3415277	3416037	Thanks a lot, you guys.
3416998	3418579	Maybe if I come in the winter, I'll have to try that.
3418639	3419660	That sounds like a winter treat.
3419780	3421781	I think if I try to eat that in the summer, that might be kind of weird.
3422222	3423322	But thank you very much for the email.
3424603	3429047	You know, I might know which podcast you're talking about, because I keep tabs on a few that are going on, and you know...
3429989	3430750	It's tough.
3431010	3431851	Things change.
3431951	3433292	Our personal lives change.
3433532	3436174	And sometimes, you know, it just affects what's going on.
3436535	3443280	And as much as I would love to do Orange Lounge Radio forever, you know, there might come a time where I have to move for work.
3443401	3444722	DarkSakura has to move.
3444882	3446063	Loki's got to go somewhere.
3446423	3449326	You know, and we would like to think that we would keep the show going.
3449406	3454830	So I applaud the other shows that try to keep on going despite the other little setbacks that go on.
3454870	3456812	And I want to continue to support independent radio forever.
3457152	3462037	My advice, if it's new people that have been thrown into it, give them a couple weeks to warm up.
3462057	3463998	Because I'll tell you what, this shit ain't easy.
3464639	3468983	I realize it seems like it's easy because you hear all these shows and you form opinions on them.
3469303	3473687	But the difference between doing and listening is really, really, really different.
3474107	3475228	And trust me, it raises my...
3478055	3481216	Perception of Independent Podcasts just so much more by doing one of my own.
3481276	3483417	So, you know, give them a chance.
3483497	3486619	I bet you that same thing that you liked before will come back.
3486659	3489880	But if, you know, not, we appreciate the fact that you check us out and support us.
3490280	3492601	And the fact that you're supporting independent radio at all is awesome.
3492681	3496883	So I hope things go good for you and the shows that you're listening to.
3497103	3498024	Let's go to a new email.
3498484	3500365	This person did not sign their email.
3500425	3504767	So I will, let's see, I'll just call them Tolu because I think that's what...
3505899	3508302	The subject in support of the PSP because of the uninformed bashing and ninty fanboys
3516263	3518944	We asked for emails like this, so here you go.
3519764	3523725	Over the last couple months, the Sony bashing in the news has become almost unbearable.
3524065	3529726	They bash the PSP saying that it has no good games or just ports, while the DS has just as many.
3529846	3538248	For example, Animal Crossing, New Super Mario Bros., Castlevania, wait, you can go outside the castle, Innovative, Metroid, etc.
3538508	3538848	Sorry.
3539268	3542671	I want a deeper experience instead of minigames or games from 15 years ago.
3543072	3549017	I like Syphon Filter, Daxter, Tekken, Metal Gear Solid, LocoRoco, Wipeout, and GTA.
3549137	3550318	Not Mario again.
3550819	3552240	Ninty fans don't care, though.
3553221	3553861	There's that email.
3555720	3564345	I appreciate your perspective, because I think this guy does bring up a point, is that a lot of people say the PSP is the same shit over again, and then run off to play the newest Mario game.
3564365	3565846	Wait, he brought up another point, though, too.
3565986	3566186	What?
3566326	3567147	He's wrong.
3567807	3568607	Hold on, hold on.
3568868	3581855	But I do have to say, okay, wait a minute, though, because the games that you mentioned at the end there, Tekken, Metal Gear Solid, Wipeout, Grand Theft, those are all franchises, too, that get a new game every year, so I don't know if that's the best perspective.
3581895	3583036	Hold on, hold on.
3583900	3586083	I agree, there's not a lot on the PSP.
3586403	3590869	But then again, I do own a PSP, and to be honest, I play more on my PSP than I do on my DS.
3592351	3596055	And he's right in most aspects, but he's also wrong in some stuff too.
3596316	3599019	He's right in the fact that there are a lot of games that are just ports.
3599059	3602764	I mean, Super Mario 64 for the DS, Animal Crossing...
3603775	3610817	Not quite a port, more of like kind of an upgrade to the current game, but still not very different to where it's like a different game.
3610837	3611377	I don't know.
3612517	3613157	That's different.
3613477	3619559	You are getting some exclusive games like, you know, you've got the Tony Hawk American Skate Land and the new Downhill Jam is going to be coming out.
3620439	3623559	They are getting like some exclusive new games and stuff.
3623960	3626400	Castlevania, yeah, Castlevania is pretty much Castlevania.
3626520	3627340	It is a new game.
3627400	3630081	It's not a port of like, say, Castlevania 2 or something like that.
3630961	3631622	So that's new.
3631942	3636586	And for longtime fans of the series, getting to go outside the castle is something new, but I get your point.
3637086	3639368	Now for the PSP though, you have the same thing.
3639468	3647934	I mean, PSP Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection, it's a port of the arcade game, it's also a port of Tekken 5, but still it's good to have a fighting game on, you know.
3648414	3648954	The PSP.
3649214	3651595	Also, you've got all these collections that are coming out.
3651615	3656276	You've got the Capcom Puzzle Collection, which is ports of old games.
3657556	3661857	My biggest gripe with Sony, we'll get Twisted Metal head-on.
3662057	3663178	This is a port of Twisted Metal 2.
3663818	3665358	That is a blatant port of the game.
3665398	3669139	They didn't change really anything other than adding online multiplayer.
3670199	3672260	But in the same aspect, I think both...
3673083	3675265	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3693090	3695891	I was hoping for a little bit better of a game.
3696011	3701794	You know, Twisted Metal head on, you know, I wanted it to be a new game, and it was just the old game all over again.
3701854	3704916	GS68 brings up an interesting counterpoint in our chatroom right there.
3704976	3707797	Also, the Oil Army ports render the original obsolete.
3708017	3711819	Not on portables, because that way I can play my favorite games on the go.
3711959	3713520	I don't need a TV or a system.
3714220	3715681	in the car or on the train.
3715701	3717881	Right, but it renders the original obsolete.
3717941	3719222	So what about the game on the TV?
3719802	3723943	It's a completely different experience playing the same game on a TV and on the portable.
3724063	3724983	I want to point this out too.
3725023	3731505	Yuri Lover says, Objection, because there are other games that are original on the Nintendo DS and cites the following.
3731585	3734606	WarioWare, Phoenix Wright, Trauma Center, Nintendogs.
3735046	3738671	WarioWare is not really, because I came out on Game Boy Advance.
3738691	3740994	Okay, but you get the point, though.
3741054	3744479	It is a really original game.
3744499	3747243	Japanese, but okay, whatever, whatever.
3747263	3748424	Okay, I'll help them out then.
3748505	3751649	Electroplankton, Elite Beat Agents, there you go.
3752332	3755233	Okay, well, if you want PSP games, let me try to think here.
3755913	3757013	Luminous, I understand.
3757313	3759353	But look, here's the thing.
3759373	3759813	That's enough.
3761034	3761554	Here's the thing.
3761754	3762514	I've always said this.
3762874	3768035	The PSP is a great system if you want to do more with a handheld than just game.
3768435	3774516	If you want to do the web, music, movies, all that crap is great on the PSP.
3774616	3779117	And that's really the reason to own a PSP, because you want something that's a multimedia thing on the go.
3779697	3781739	and that's kind of where Sony's going.
3781759	3783861	PlayStation 3, I think it's going to be a lot of that as well.
3784241	3789106	I think you're going to see in the long run from PlayStation 3, it doesn't want to be just a game system.
3789526	3792409	Sony's biggest problem is that Xbox 360 doesn't want to be just a game system either.
3792489	3793570	But never mind, that's another day.
3794351	3796072	Nintendo, on the other hand, is...
3797153	3800476	Starting to catch up with some of that with the Opera browser coming out and everything.
3800896	3803838	But for now, it's really just about the games.
3803878	3804599	Games, games, games.
3804919	3812885	And if you want some fun, short attention span, most of the time, types of games, you know, for the casual gamer, Nintendo DS is where it's at.
3813406	3817309	Honestly, if you're a real hardcore gamer, you ought to own both.
3817529	3818109	If you can afford it.
3818590	3819530	If you can't afford it, get a job.
3819610	3822853	And to be honest, I mean, what are people complaining about ports anyways?
3822953	3825275	Because if you don't like them, don't buy them.
3826030	3826711	or Don'tPlayThem.
3827231	3829453	And there's a lot coming out for both systems.
3829813	3832795	Granted, when I look at it, I think most of it's crap.
3832915	3835097	But then again, I only play one game on my PSP.
3835537	3839960	So I don't really have a valid opinion on most of this stuff.
3840040	3843423	But there is a lot of games that come out that I'm just not impressed with.
3843703	3844944	I'm just like, whatever.
3845224	3845464	Ouch.
3845804	3850688	The chat room is bringing up from various folks there that the DS has had their share of misfires.
3851108	3852349	Such as Ping Pals.
3852669	3853149	Oh, God.
3853169	3854030	Sprung, anyone?
3854050	3855371	Sprung was funny.
3855631	3858973	Sprung was the worst video game I've ever played in my life.
3859353	3862695	If you play as the guy, the game is hilarious.
3863516	3864096	One more email.
3864116	3865077	I'm going to do one more email.
3865097	3865417	Whatever.
3865457	3866998	This one is from DJ Tyrant.
3867952	3869193	Hello, Jamie, Rob, and Matt.
3869233	3870254	Hope all is well with you.
3870414	3875179	I finally have caught back up with the show now that I have moved and have cable internet at the place I'm currently living.
3875599	3879483	Sounds like the show is doing great, like always, and is very informative and actually helps me out at my work.
3879623	3880904	I work at EB Games, FYI.
3881324	3882345	That's actually quite a compliment.
3882365	3882586	Thank you.
3882826	3886289	I've actually heard of stores that have been playing our show over the system.
3886369	3888411	I think that is crazy, but awesome.
3888491	3888831	I love it.
3888951	3889312	That's awesome.
3889332	3889832	That's weird.
3890092	3891714	It's better than Ian Kessler.
3891914	3895097	It's gotta be better than the EB Games Television or whatever that crap is.
3895117	3898581	Ian Kessler and Courtney Friel, they both suck and I want to beat them up.
3898601	3901124	If you work at EB Games, get our show played in there.
3901184	3906629	We will send you versions that have the S words and F words bleeped out if we will get played in store.
3906669	3907290	That's pretty hot.
3908792	3914498	Anyways, the point of this email was to encourage the OL Army to get involved in the Beatmania US Internet Ranking.
3915058	3919500	I think it would be a great way to show Konami interest in the game and that people did actually buy the game.
3919920	3923662	Currently, I've only seen Drew Nami and myself in the internet ranking so far.
3923762	3924642	Sorry if I missed anyone.
3924963	3926883	If you could mention this on the show, that would be great.
3927204	3931726	Okay, so if you're a music game fan, go show your love in the Beatmania internet ranking.
3931746	3932206	That makes sense.
3932266	3938629	For the record, they did see that game as a success, and it sold as many units, or it outsold as many units as they thought it would, so...
3939409	3940810	That sounds like a good sign.
3940930	3942330	We'll see.
3942530	3947252	Also, I am really looking forward to the music previews for DDR Ultramix 4 and DDR Universe.
3947712	3949133	Sorry about the delay there.
3950113	3953815	When are you going to get some music previews for In the Groove 3?
3954835	3956356	With a little face on it.
3956816	3957276	You know what?
3957776	3958997	Have Rockstar give us a call.
3959037	3959517	We're open.
3960658	3963199	Keep up the great work and I can't wait to hear your next show.
3963299	3966740	Maybe sometime in the future I will see you guys again at a con or something like that.
3967150	3972397	as it was a disappointment to see you, OnlyRob, I believe, for an extremely short time by the Konami booth at E3 this year.
3972833	3974174	Anyway, stay healthy and well, guys.
3974214	3975394	I'm glad your show is doing so great.
3975615	3976275	DJ Tyrant.
3976315	3977195	Thank you very much for the email.
3977215	3977816	It was very sweet.
3978796	3983139	As far as other previews for other games go, we're not exclusive.
3983419	3985620	We branched out of the music game thing a long time ago.
3985660	3986640	We love music games.
3986680	3989062	Don't get us wrong, but we love all video games as well.
3989142	3993604	So if any company wants to do some type of premiere thing, we're down.
3993664	3994705	Just have them give us a call.
3994825	3996566	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.
3997026	3999347	You can use that for your comments as well.
3999387	4000088	Talk about your game.
4000348	4000768	That's right.
4001885	4003025	We would love to get you on the show.
4003846	4008387	Absolutely, yes, we've given In the Groove somewhat of a hard time on the show in the past, but you know what?
4008567	4009648	I'm willing to give it a try.
4010728	4012668	And I actually don't hate In the Groove.
4012709	4013349	I think it's fine.
4013389	4014409	It's an alternative.
4014929	4015889	Some people like Coke.
4015950	4016930	Some people like Pepsi.
4017190	4018450	Some people like Coke.
4018490	4019591	Some people like pee.
4019851	4022492	And some people like RC Cola for some god-awful reason.
4022512	4023312	RC Cola is okay.
4023392	4023732	All right.
4024232	4025252	Moving on, please.
4025693	4026133	Anyways.
4027441	4036724	Well, scratch one other loss for Sony, unfortunately, in their battle against Homebrew.
4037024	4037504	Well, yes.
4038444	4055429	Firmware 2.8 has been hacked, and now Homebrew is able... So far, they have found an exploit in 2.8, and they have Homebrew running now in every single firmware that's available from 2.0 and up, and of course, 1.5 and whatnot.
4057330	4067738	Um, so that's kind of interesting, and the best part about it, you don't need Grand Theft Auto for it to work, because unfortunately with some of the other ones, that's how you had to do it, is with Grand Theft Auto.
4068238	4083250	But now, they do have a Hello World proof of concept homebrew program that is available out there, and, um, yeah, it's quite interesting actually, because, um, there's also, was a story that I read, um, this week, that they're
4084158	4084398	and so on.
4104486	4105287	GPS comes out.
4107029	4108851	How are you doing with the liquor?
4108971	4111614	I think I hear you starting to slur a little bit and I'm doing the same thing.
4111634	4112114	Oh, I'm fine.
4112334	4114737	I'm like halfway through that.
4114997	4117420	The chat room pointed out to me that you can call our mailbag.
4117460	4118961	It's something I said earlier, I guess.
4119021	4119322	I don't know.
4120518	4121498	Whatever, I'm not paying attention.
4121538	4121958	Shut up!
4122118	4123359	No, but here's the thing.
4123379	4124519	You don't know me!
4125119	4126020	You don't know my life.
4126180	4129321	I'm just like, I'm starting to get sick of the watermelon thing.
4129381	4129981	You want something new?
4130361	4130741	No.
4130841	4132221	You want some pineapple?
4132241	4132621	I do want... No, no.
4132641	4133782	You want some of the... You want to try this again?
4133922	4135402	No, no, I don't want that stuff.
4135582	4137143	Especially if you don't want the orange juice.
4137383	4137603	Pussy.
4138877	4139958	I just don't like orange juice.
4140218	4147423	Unfortunately, I've got this thing stuck in my head now where orange juice equals vomiting, and so it's not good drinking.
4147443	4147823	You know what?
4147883	4155808	One of the first times I ever threw up, I threw up SpaghettiOs, and for some reason, I've never been able to really eat SpaghettiOs the same way ever since then.
4156489	4157789	Well, you know what's interesting, though?
4157809	4161071	The first time I threw up here from over-drinking was...
4162537	4164038	Minestrone Blue Raspberry Jell-O
4182577	4184198	Which was actually not that bad.
4184218	4187860	It's good going down and coming up.
4187920	4190321	It was kind of like, wow, kind of sweet.
4190561	4192142	They should put that on the box.
4192782	4193782	Raspberry Jell-O.
4194123	4196604	Great going down, pretty good coming up.
4200065	4200986	I can see it now.
4203052	4204234	Fuck those Pudding Pops.
4204395	4207079	Shane, you might have to do the rest of the stories tonight.
4207140	4207801	How's that sound?
4208362	4210045	Okay, I'm just going to complain.
4210145	4212870	So how's that Suikoden doing?
4213732	4214413	Fuck Suikoden.
4218163	4219024	I will kill you.
4219044	4219624	I'm just kidding.
4219644	4220746	Suikoden's not that bad.
4220826	4221546	It's great.
4221566	4222627	It's just not that great either.
4223488	4227152	When are they putting out Suikoden on PSP?
4230154	4235239	Well, there's this movement on an official Konami site.
4235359	4238102	It's like konamigamestars.com.
4238142	4243407	It's an RPG site that Konami opened for the US fans of the Konami RPGs.
4244116	4251642	And they want the fans to show how much they want this port of 1 and 2 that came out for PSP in Japan to come out over here.
4252183	4265954	So I'm sure I just made up the website URL I just sent with the KonamiGameStars.com, but if you go there and show your support, I mean, we're really trying to get it to come out here, so...
4266943	4268124	Show that it will sell.
4268144	4271127	Can't you talk to someone at work and make it happen?
4271167	4274570	We've been talking for a long time about this game coming out over here.
4274630	4276832	He's like, come on, put it out on the PSP.
4276872	4279915	Can I come to your work and berate people?
4279975	4282518	Because obviously Kami doesn't mind if people drink.
4282918	4284418	I don't even have a freaking office at my job.
4284458	4286659	No, no, I have to share my office with two other people.
4305373	4310036	I do too, but just one other person and he's leaving soon, so I'm going to get the office office myself again.
4310056	4311317	That was a funny thing, Rob.
4312818	4320744	Since our sales staff is down to two people now for the games, at least they're in our building, my co-worker is like, yeah, at the end of September I'm thinking about leaving.
4320804	4321364	I'm like, sweet!
4321624	4322525	It will be just me!
4323866	4324566	That would be awesome.
4325547	4326568	I'd fucking own everybody.
4327668	4328229	Alright, um...
4329952	4333277	Oh, uh, Eddie would like to point out his Konami RPG stars, by the way.
4333597	4334278	What did I say?
4334298	4334578	I don't know.
4334599	4336361	I think I said something... You're not even drunk!
4336381	4337042	What's your excuse?
4337262	4338043	I'm stupid!
4338143	4340226	That's pretty much my excuse.
4340306	4341788	Yeah, yeah, you are.
4342189	4342570	Okay, look.
4343801	4346163	Trying to get through this segment in under two hours, please.
4346963	4349405	Moving on, you know, because we don't want to get any more.
4349445	4351746	We don't need any angry iTunes reviews this week.
4352106	4354207	This show is too fucking long.
4354348	4357069	I don't want to download this show because it's too long.
4357549	4359971	I like my news short.
4359991	4360411	You know what?
4360451	4361232	Turn on G4.
4361252	4364133	You'll get about two minutes of game news in an entire 24-hour period.
4364214	4365094	And then Star Trek.
4369397	4369697	You know...
4370560	4375062	This month's PlayStation Magazine has a scoop on the new PSP model.
4375142	4378684	Apparently, the unit features 8GB of flash memory built in.
4378864	4379345	Wow!
4379845	4383007	On top of that, there's a video camera still being planned, but no hard drive.
4384147	4388189	I seem to recall there was something I read later in the week where Sony said, Nope.
4388230	4388650	Lies.
4388950	4389690	It's all lies.
4389810	4390571	It's not happening.
4390851	4393112	Was that the official PlayStation Magazine or PSM?
4393452	4395093	I think it was the official PlayStation Magazine.
4395113	4399255	What the hell's wrong with these official... Let's just make up news.
4399355	4399976	Who cares?
4400444	4404267	It'll give the PSP more attention.
4404427	4407650	Fuck, chatroom pointed out I said something that was banned last week.
4408070	4408591	G4.
4409812	4411213	I'm not banned, I say whatever I want.
4411233	4413114	Yes, but you're not drunk, I can use that as an excuse.
4413715	4413955	Sorry.
4414015	4414676	Bad run.
4414696	4416297	No, but I made fun of him, so it's okay.
4417678	4420921	No, I still think, it's Borderlands, let it happen again.
4421701	4423383	By the way though, I'm sorry.
4424404	4424944	Very sorry.
4425004	4428327	I do gotta mention, they are remaking the original Star Trek series.
4428735	4432738	They're redoing all the CG effects in it, so you know that'll be playing on a certain channel soon.
4433339	4435200	Anyways... Yay!
4436561	4437882	Anyways... A little quieter.
4439103	4439864	The PlayStation 3.
4439924	4453235	There's news, actually from the Enquirer, which I'm sure is a great source of game news, that the RSX chip in the PlayStation 3, which it originally was set to run at 550, 700 core memory,
4456733	4461719	has been realigned with the expectations that the value will be dropped to $506.50.
4462380	4466365	In other words, being throttled down.
4467667	4469950	And what's that supposed to mean to you?
4470070	4471431	Probably nothing because...
4472132	4472973	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4497714	4503597	The slogan for the PlayStation 3 ad campaign has been revealed and it's called This Is Living.
4504039	4508482	That is the new catchphrase you're going to hear, at least in Europe, I believe, but I think they're going to use that in the rest of the world.
4508822	4509262	Let's hope not.
4509302	4513165	But if you take that last story into account, I think the tagline should have been, this is burning.
4513185	4516207	I don't think, I think they already have a catchphrase here in the U.S.
4516587	4518708	It's called, we used the Spider-Man logo.
4518748	4519569	Play Beyond?
4519729	4521470	Yeah, Play Beyond, I think.
4521570	4523251	Well, I don't know, somewhere else they're calling it.
4523271	4525312	This is living.
4525493	4530396	This is living in poverty because they spent all my money on a PlayStation 3.
4530456	4530856	Hurrah.
4536552	4537813	This is Welfare!
4561874	4562855	This is crappy.
4562875	4563236	This is awful.
4563256	4563776	This joke needs to die.
4580245	4584926	Rayman, of course, is coming to the Wii in the form of Rayman Raving Rabbids.
4585987	4592109	And somehow the rumor got started that this game was going to be Wii exclusive, although I never heard that in my life.
4592509	4597750	But needless to say, it was picked up earlier this week that Rayman is not going to be Wii exclusive.
4599391	4605613	Now, I don't know, there's all this confusion going on at Ubisoft because, you know, is Assassin's Creed exclusive and blah, blah, blah.
4605673	4609354	Supposedly, it's supposed to hit more next-gen systems next year.
4610061	4612484	Assassin's Creed, though, is definitely multi-platform.
4612504	4614627	You know, PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.
4615027	4617690	So why the hell shouldn't Rayman be multi-platform?
4617710	4619392	Corey, Ubisoft, I even asked them this.
4619713	4622796	No, it's not exclusive, and it will be coming out.
4622856	4628483	Now, the Wii version is going to be exclusive to the Wii, obviously, because it has a different control system.
4629525	4630786	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4651909	4652950	GameLock, Unconstitutional, Mike Hatch
4674383	4683839	His reason for appealing it says, What the act really does is make sure the parents are involved in the decisions of whether their children should play violent or sexually explicit video games.
4684677	4689340	I agree with him in that statement because, yeah, parents should be involved with what their kids play.
4689700	4695504	However, I don't think the law should really do much as restricting people because I think it should really be up to the parents.
4696044	4701367	Anyways, the law simply prohibits children 16 years old and younger from buying those types of games.
4701788	4707071	If the parents aren't troubled by their kids playing these games, they can buy them for their children.
4707291	4713835	But that still doesn't make any sense because what if these, say for example, little billies at a, you know,
4714562	4715462	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4734542	4739663	Yeah, it's illegal to sell alcohol to a minor, but if your mom buys it for you, it's okay if you drink it.
4739903	4742044	That's kind of the way that they're phrasing this.
4742464	4746925	Which makes this law even more retarded, which there's no reason for the law anyways.
4747405	4749585	Drunami in our chatroom says, enough is enough.
4749785	4756527	I'm not sure if he's talking about what you're saying or all the incessant snakes on a plane jokes that are still going on in chatroom.
4756567	4757287	It's so annoying.
4757307	4759527	You know how I watched that movie this week?
4760128	4760668	Lame!
4764676	4767379	Yeah, Macman says, here's the pop culture reference of the year.
4767539	4770382	Insert animal here on a insert form of transportation.
4770562	4771423	Like Mad Libs.
4774085	4775647	Chainsaw on a dog.
4776388	4783435	Anyway, if you want to join in the craziness that is our chat room, just head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on chat.
4784841	4788083	Alright, I guess that's going to do it for Part A of our podcast.
4788103	4795188	We're going to take a little bit of a break and we're going to come right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio to come in Part B. Tonight in Part B of our program.
4796224	4798906	I could beat three right now
4820540	4820820	Maybe.
