00:13.905 --> 00:26.518
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, September 24th, 2006, PlayStation 3 reaction from the Tokyo Game Show, the cult shooter classic is about to get a sequel, and the company that makes music game controllers sues someone over music game controllers.

00:32.918 --> 00:34.438
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everybody out there on the internet.

00:34.558 --> 00:37.479
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome once again to Orange Lounge Radio.

00:37.879 --> 00:43.280
[SPEAKER_02]: We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, and the gamer culture and lifestyle.

00:43.720 --> 00:44.660
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts.

00:44.680 --> 00:45.700
[SPEAKER_02]: You might know me as Sky.

00:45.760 --> 00:50.281
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Miss Jamie Summers.

00:50.661 --> 00:51.101
[SPEAKER_07]: Rawr.

00:51.361 --> 00:51.822
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?

00:52.382 --> 00:52.802
[SPEAKER_07]: Rawr.

00:52.942 --> 00:53.262
[SPEAKER_02]: Rawr.

00:54.322 --> 00:54.722
[SPEAKER_07]: Rawr.

00:55.022 --> 00:55.522
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Zip.

00:56.842 --> 00:58.643
[SPEAKER_02]: Or ARJ if you're old school.

00:58.983 --> 00:59.483
[SPEAKER_02]: Rawr.

00:59.503 --> 00:59.603
[SPEAKER_02]: Rawr.

01:01.953 --> 01:05.175
[SPEAKER_02]: Also say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

01:05.776 --> 01:05.976
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

01:06.276 --> 01:06.737
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?

01:09.198 --> 01:09.839
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm frustrated.

01:10.239 --> 01:10.459
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

01:11.160 --> 01:13.822
[SPEAKER_03]: Because certain things aren't working the way they should be.

01:14.282 --> 01:14.663
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

01:15.363 --> 01:16.024
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you hate that?

01:16.644 --> 01:17.305
[SPEAKER_03]: I do hate that.

01:17.945 --> 01:20.827
[SPEAKER_02]: How things are described is very simple, yet never are.

01:21.888 --> 01:22.608
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to life.

01:22.789 --> 01:23.429
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's your manual.

01:24.490 --> 01:27.212
[SPEAKER_02]: Also say hello to joining us tonight once again.

01:28.126 --> 01:29.127
[SPEAKER_02]: 7-Zip is the wave of the future, dammit

01:56.505 --> 02:15.475
[SPEAKER_02]: or if you want to hear the whole thing in bulk you can listen to us live when we record on OrangeLawnRadio.com on Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time or you can listen to our rebroadcast live of Parts A and B that plays on All Games Radio over at AllGames.com and that plays Monday nights at 5 o'clock Pacific or I believe 9 a.m.

02:15.695 --> 02:16.415
[SPEAKER_02]: on Tuesdays.

02:16.535 --> 02:22.018
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're an early bird you can always catch that and you can hear all the show before it hits the podcast stream.

02:22.538 --> 02:26.722
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, we're going to start off as we always do, talking about our gaming week.

02:27.042 --> 02:29.444
[SPEAKER_02]: Or in DarkSakura's case, perhaps her pinball week.

02:29.544 --> 02:29.924
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

02:30.805 --> 02:31.346
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, really.

02:31.426 --> 02:39.733
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, all I played this week was Star Trek The Next Generation Pinball, which we finally have mostly working, except for a couple of...

02:40.956 --> 02:44.038
[SPEAKER_04]: Really crappy soldering jobs, whoever the previous owner was.

02:44.418 --> 02:51.641
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like, oh, let's just put a bunch of goo here and solder it and let's use hot glue to put this ramp back together and all this crap.

02:51.781 --> 02:53.342
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Dan's been working on it.

02:53.382 --> 02:54.423
[SPEAKER_04]: It's working just fine now.

02:55.143 --> 02:56.524
[SPEAKER_04]: And other than that, I ain't played crap.

02:56.884 --> 02:58.605
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I've been like, urgh!

02:59.185 --> 03:00.325
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been sick all this past week.

03:00.846 --> 03:02.106
[SPEAKER_02]: Pinball's still a type of game.

03:02.346 --> 03:03.607
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinball is what we had before Pong.

03:03.767 --> 03:04.287
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinball!

03:10.422 --> 03:13.584
[SPEAKER_04]: is the backbone of the gaming community.

03:14.165 --> 03:17.267
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, them's big words there, but I would agree.

03:17.307 --> 03:20.750
[SPEAKER_04]: Without pinball, we would not have our arcades.

03:21.210 --> 03:23.992
[SPEAKER_02]: In the gaming tree, pinball is an essential branch.

03:25.133 --> 03:26.194
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinball is the root.

03:26.614 --> 03:27.855
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I've said it before on this show.

03:27.915 --> 03:33.599
[SPEAKER_02]: Pinball was something I went to the arcades to play before DDR, because I didn't play a whole lot in the arcades before that.

03:33.940 --> 03:38.543
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe your occasional fighter, Street Fighter II, back when that was huge, when I was in junior high school.

03:39.256 --> 03:40.737
[SPEAKER_02]: using E-Honda's 100-Hand Slap.

03:40.757 --> 03:44.500
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, I was 100-Hand Slapping, bitches, long before Xbox Live, okay?

03:44.580 --> 03:59.171
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I remember going back in the old days and playing Old Black Knight before it had a digital display, playing the Time Machine one before we had digital displays.

03:59.271 --> 03:59.891
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinbot.

04:00.452 --> 04:02.593
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, Pinbot was the shit.

04:02.914 --> 04:05.435
[SPEAKER_02]: Was Pinbot... I'll ask you this, then we'll move on.

04:05.796 --> 04:07.417
[SPEAKER_02]: Was Pinbot on the NES...

04:08.211 --> 04:13.796
[SPEAKER_02]: A great thing or a horrible mistransformation of the pinball experience?

04:13.996 --> 04:15.257
[SPEAKER_04]: Believe it or not, I didn't have it.

04:15.537 --> 04:22.003
[SPEAKER_04]: The first pinball games that I actually played on a home console was this, like, Gator game on the old school Game Boy.

04:22.043 --> 04:23.164
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God, Revenge of the Gator, yes.

04:23.184 --> 04:29.169
[SPEAKER_04]: Revenge of the Gator and Devil's Crush on TurboGrafx.

04:29.189 --> 04:30.250
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ever play Pinball Quest?

04:30.530 --> 04:30.650
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

04:30.790 --> 04:31.431
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta find that.

04:31.451 --> 04:33.052
[SPEAKER_04]: Sonic Spinball, however, was my game.

04:33.232 --> 04:34.373
[SPEAKER_02]: Sonic Spinball was pretty awesome.

04:34.534 --> 04:34.634
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

04:34.654 --> 04:35.054
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you that.

04:35.814 --> 04:38.475
[SPEAKER_02]: Pinball Quest, though, is an interesting 8-bit title.

04:38.535 --> 04:42.937
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those things, like, it was a really good concept, but it was a little bit glitchy sometimes.

04:43.137 --> 04:44.358
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have to agree with Actdeft.

04:44.378 --> 04:47.939
[SPEAKER_04]: Terminator 2 pinball ruled, but we're actually trying to work on getting a Medieval Madness.

04:49.120 --> 04:55.543
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you want to join our chatroom and make comments, such as that last person just did, you can join our chatroom over at www.orangelandrady.com.

04:55.563 --> 04:56.563
[SPEAKER_02]: Click on chat.

04:56.723 --> 04:59.685
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, one thing I need to tell Jaded is that we have a Guns N' Roses now.

05:00.385 --> 05:00.645
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

05:01.104 --> 05:02.485
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan's Busy Rearranging Our Entire House

05:29.088 --> 05:32.229
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to get four pinball machines in and two maim cabinets.

05:32.429 --> 05:34.850
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet I still have not come over and played all these pinball machines.

05:34.890 --> 05:35.530
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I need to.

05:35.670 --> 05:38.731
[SPEAKER_04]: He's building me a maim cabinet out of a Tekken 3, so I'm fairly happy.

05:38.811 --> 05:39.331
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty hot.

05:40.191 --> 05:41.311
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, we'll move on.

05:41.371 --> 05:42.712
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

05:42.772 --> 05:43.612
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you play any pinball?

05:44.132 --> 05:44.712
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I did not.

05:44.892 --> 05:45.432
[SPEAKER_02]: That's too bad.

05:45.492 --> 05:46.253
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what did you play?

05:47.493 --> 05:50.534
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I played Saints Row and did a little bit more than that.

05:50.594 --> 05:51.274
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty fun.

05:52.214 --> 05:55.515
[SPEAKER_03]: And a little bit of Bomberman, just because I have it.

05:56.896 --> 05:58.096
[SPEAKER_03]: And Cookie Mama, I

05:58.905 --> 05:59.786
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

06:19.912 --> 06:21.613
[SPEAKER_03]: I've gotten rid of most of my other DS games.

06:21.633 --> 06:28.419
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, tell, explain to us, you know, because there's probably a lot of people who've seen this game on the shelves, you know, it's Cookie Mama, and it's gone, what the F is that?

06:28.579 --> 06:29.360
[SPEAKER_02]: So what the F is that?

06:29.380 --> 06:38.407
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically a bunch of mini-games that, you know, you play through, and depending on how you, you know, you complete them, you get a score at the end.

06:38.467 --> 06:43.391
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically they have different, you know, mini-games depending on what dish you're, you know, creating.

06:43.451 --> 06:43.611
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

06:44.232 --> 06:48.254
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, rice, you know, you'll have, you know, the first mini-game will be measure out the rice.

06:48.574 --> 06:51.475
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have to measure it to a line, and you have to do it within a time limit.

06:51.875 --> 06:54.536
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they have another one that's a Japanese import game, right?

06:55.257 --> 06:55.437
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

06:55.637 --> 06:58.178
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, just... So rice is the first stage?

06:58.458 --> 06:59.438
[SPEAKER_03]: Rice is the first stage.

06:59.458 --> 06:59.819
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

06:59.879 --> 07:01.639
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have to measure out the water.

07:01.659 --> 07:02.200
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your joke here, sorry.

07:02.220 --> 07:05.781
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have, you know, the stage where you have to wash the rice.

07:06.381 --> 07:08.962
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have the stage where you have to cook the rice.

07:09.363 --> 07:12.324
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're all just, like, basically rhythm and, you know...

07:13.720 --> 07:16.061
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kind of, like, cutting and tapping and stuff like that.

07:16.081 --> 07:19.582
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, see, wouldn't this game be more fun, though, if there was rapping in the background, you know?

07:20.002 --> 07:20.542
[SPEAKER_02]: Possibly.

07:22.742 --> 07:23.683
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, wash the rice.

07:23.743 --> 07:24.603
[SPEAKER_02]: Do-do-do-do-do.

07:24.823 --> 07:27.264
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, or what was the, uh, I'm the cooking chicken.

07:27.344 --> 07:32.865
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's, the problem with the game is the sensitivity is really, like, off on a lot of the games.

07:33.025 --> 07:36.066
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, you're really going to get frustrated with stuff.

07:37.691 --> 07:37.992
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

07:38.412 --> 07:44.355
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's also some levels that don't really give you a good description of what you're supposed to do, so it's kind of hard and you get frustrated real easy.

07:44.575 --> 07:47.736
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is why Nellie stopped playing, because she couldn't figure out what the hell she was supposed to do in certain levels.

07:48.397 --> 07:50.358
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it doesn't really explain it to you.

07:50.378 --> 07:56.561
[SPEAKER_03]: They give you the option to practice it, but they don't really kind of take you through a tutorial to tell you how to cook.

07:57.221 --> 07:58.522
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just like, DO IT!

07:59.982 --> 08:01.143
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Japanese are smarter.

08:01.623 --> 08:04.445
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's just the way that is.

08:05.045 --> 08:05.125
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

08:05.523 --> 08:06.984
[SPEAKER_03]: Grand Theft Auto, Zuma, Fusion Frenzy 2

08:23.413 --> 08:26.596
[SPEAKER_03]: Fusion Frenzy 2 sucks balls, and I will not be buying that game.

08:26.656 --> 08:26.977
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

08:27.337 --> 08:28.318
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked interesting for the trailer.

08:28.338 --> 08:29.760
[SPEAKER_03]: It was extremely lame.

08:30.100 --> 08:30.981
[SPEAKER_03]: Extremely lame.

08:31.001 --> 08:31.902
[SPEAKER_03]: What was lame about it?

08:32.243 --> 08:33.965
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the games themselves are just dumb.

08:34.265 --> 08:40.592
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, there's one level, it's like, we're trying to be Mario Party, but we're not even coming near Mario Party.

08:40.652 --> 08:43.936
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just all these mini-games that have, there's like no point to them.

08:44.987 --> 08:46.308
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're just dumb.

08:46.709 --> 08:54.116
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, is it maybe just because it's a demo and maybe it's just not... All the other minigames, you know, are just kind of variations of these minigames.

08:54.656 --> 09:04.966
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like, you know, there's one of them that you're kind of these gladiator, you know, American gladiator type ball things and you're rolling around and you basically, okay, who can cover the most space with their color?

09:05.886 --> 09:07.508
[SPEAKER_03]: And, okay, that's kind of lame.

09:07.830 --> 09:17.181
[SPEAKER_03]: and then there is another one where you have to pick up boxes and put them in your corner and you can steal boxes from other players it's just it screams Mario Kart but or not Mario Kart Mario Party

09:17.742 --> 09:19.863
[SPEAKER_03]: Without any of the actual board stuff.

09:20.064 --> 09:21.805
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a very lame, generic game.

09:23.366 --> 09:29.509
[SPEAKER_03]: And surprising enough, it's also by Hudson, which made the wonderful smash hit game Bomberman Act Zero.

09:29.590 --> 09:30.610
[SPEAKER_03]: So are we surprised?

09:30.630 --> 09:32.952
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, but at the same time, they also made Mario Party.

09:33.432 --> 09:34.513
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent, but you know what?

09:34.553 --> 09:38.695
[SPEAKER_03]: They've really sucked it up on the 360 so far, so whatever.

09:38.975 --> 09:40.116
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ever play the first one?

09:40.817 --> 09:41.137
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I didn't.

09:41.157 --> 09:42.878
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's an interesting comment in our chatroom here.

09:43.058 --> 09:46.280
[SPEAKER_02]: Mystic Gohan says, Fusion Frenzy 2 sucked, but number one owned.

09:47.372 --> 09:50.174
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe this is going to be better in a full game, but I'm not buying it.

09:50.274 --> 09:51.295
[SPEAKER_03]: So, whatever.

09:51.756 --> 09:54.938
[SPEAKER_03]: I also played the new Tenchu game, which was only available in Japan.

09:55.639 --> 09:57.060
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's pretty cool.

09:57.280 --> 10:03.725
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I wasn't really into Tenchu, but I like running around jumping on buildings and stuff and throwing ninja stars in the people's heads.

10:03.986 --> 10:04.806
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of cool.

10:04.986 --> 10:05.627
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that sounds fun.

10:05.907 --> 10:06.888
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so that's fun.

10:07.108 --> 10:10.131
[SPEAKER_03]: The only problem about that game, because it was in Japanese... Sounds like Shinobi.

10:10.311 --> 10:15.335
[SPEAKER_03]: I had trouble figuring out the controls, because it is kind of difficult to figure out what you've got to do.

10:15.779 --> 10:16.600
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

10:34.526 --> 10:34.866
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

10:35.466 --> 10:35.566
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

10:35.586 --> 10:37.327
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I've heard a lot of positive reviews elsewhere.

10:37.347 --> 10:38.867
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, the camera is blurry as fuck.

10:39.707 --> 10:41.127
[SPEAKER_03]: Blurry, blurry, blurry.

10:41.407 --> 10:42.807
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you just do something to it?

10:42.887 --> 10:43.028
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

10:43.048 --> 10:44.008
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you leave the sticker on?

10:44.248 --> 10:46.148
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there is no sticker on this thing.

10:46.688 --> 10:48.088
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there is a sticker on this thing.

10:49.009 --> 10:50.349
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there is no sticker on this thing.

10:50.369 --> 10:51.669
[SPEAKER_03]: It would have been hella funny if there was.

10:51.749 --> 10:52.869
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, son of a bitch!

10:54.109 --> 10:54.289
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

10:54.529 --> 10:56.970
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so, it's very blurry.

10:57.370 --> 10:58.250
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very blurry.

10:58.270 --> 11:03.031
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because it knew what you and Nellie were going to be doing with it, so it had to blur out the naughty bits.

11:04.295 --> 11:04.815
[SPEAKER_03]: Plugin PC Work

11:25.621 --> 11:27.522
[SPEAKER_03]: No, of course it's never going to be like that.

11:27.602 --> 11:29.463
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got the updated drivers for it.

11:29.763 --> 11:32.805
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny because the old drivers work kind of crappy, but they work.

11:33.025 --> 11:34.546
[SPEAKER_03]: The new drivers don't work at all.

11:34.926 --> 11:38.328
[SPEAKER_03]: So this thing is just, it's doing nothing.

11:38.428 --> 11:45.232
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to have a webcam for you guys, folks, and we were going to have the wonderful webcam, but you can thank Microsoft for putting out a really shoddy camera.

11:45.652 --> 11:47.113
[SPEAKER_02]: What would happen if I plugged that in my Mac?

11:47.373 --> 11:48.313
[SPEAKER_02]: You think it would work right away?

11:50.515 --> 11:52.095
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it'll just go, what the hell is this?

11:52.135 --> 11:53.576
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to freaking try it during the break.

11:53.916 --> 11:54.677
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I got to try.

11:55.595 --> 11:56.315
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's the thing.

11:56.755 --> 11:57.336
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for you.

11:57.496 --> 11:58.296
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the thing, though.

11:58.336 --> 12:00.597
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, the generic drivers worked on it.

12:00.677 --> 12:01.877
[SPEAKER_03]: The new drivers do not.

12:02.378 --> 12:04.618
[SPEAKER_03]: So go right ahead and try that.

12:04.698 --> 12:05.419
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

12:06.199 --> 12:06.919
[SPEAKER_03]: The new drivers don't.

12:07.039 --> 12:08.220
[SPEAKER_03]: So whatever.

12:10.641 --> 12:15.842
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the cool thing... You tried a video chat with me, and it was pretty blurry.

12:16.823 --> 12:22.625
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's interesting is that another podcaster, our old buddy Bobby, sent a picture of his kitty cat

12:23.741 --> 12:27.064
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, because you can send pictures on Xbox Live instead of messages if you want.

12:27.344 --> 12:29.687
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got a picture of his kitty cat and it was pretty clear.

12:29.707 --> 12:34.431
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a little dark, like there was some contrast issues, but he probably just didn't have the right lighting behind it.

12:35.132 --> 12:38.876
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of our houses aren't set up to have lighting behind where our systems are at.

12:39.176 --> 12:41.457
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, at least in this house, I know the lighting is like by the couch.

12:41.477 --> 12:43.038
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably why he has the contrast issues.

12:43.518 --> 12:46.919
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was sharp, unlike when we video chatted.

12:47.139 --> 12:47.740
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's the thing.

12:47.760 --> 12:52.541
[SPEAKER_03]: The video chat's only in 640 by 480, whereas the pictures are 1.3 megapixels.

12:52.581 --> 12:53.882
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, you know, the difference.

12:54.342 --> 12:59.424
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, it looks all blurry, but then when you take a picture, it's just, you know, supposed to be clear.

12:59.804 --> 13:03.806
[SPEAKER_03]: Except for your gamer tag pictures, those are still blurry as hell.

13:03.846 --> 13:06.487
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I took one, I'm like, wow, I can't see anything in that.

13:07.113 --> 13:13.617
[SPEAKER_02]: Then how come some of the other, like I have three other podcasters on my list who got the camera early because Microsoft likes them.

13:13.637 --> 13:14.198
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

13:14.338 --> 13:15.919
[SPEAKER_02]: And they all look fine.

13:17.020 --> 13:17.620
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get it.

13:17.820 --> 13:18.701
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the thing.

13:19.381 --> 13:20.022
[SPEAKER_02]: I say take it back.

13:21.443 --> 13:22.203
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not my face.

13:22.463 --> 13:23.164
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not blurry.

13:24.225 --> 13:26.706
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what SSJ100Matt in chat says.

13:26.726 --> 13:27.747
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's your face, Loki.

13:27.847 --> 13:29.728
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and here's the other thing.

13:30.069 --> 13:31.309
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Microsoft.

13:32.730 --> 13:35.672
[SPEAKER_03]: This camera is made for cyber sex.

13:38.223 --> 13:40.924
[SPEAKER_03]: I showed Rob why this camera is made for cyber sex.

13:40.964 --> 13:41.865
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very disturbing.

13:42.605 --> 13:43.906
[SPEAKER_03]: And I never want to see it again.

13:45.247 --> 13:54.272
[SPEAKER_03]: For some reason, a feature that was added into the video chat on live, and explain to me why you would need this.

13:55.753 --> 14:02.977
[SPEAKER_03]: If you push the trigger buttons on your controller, it makes the other person's controller vibrate as long as you hold them down.

14:03.996 --> 14:08.538
[SPEAKER_03]: If that does not scream video or cyber sex, I don't know what does.

14:10.139 --> 14:11.140
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Microsoft.

14:11.180 --> 14:13.461
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys really thought of everything.

14:16.502 --> 14:19.704
[SPEAKER_03]: So, your vision camera, would I recommend buying it?

14:19.844 --> 14:20.384
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

14:20.545 --> 14:26.187
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, maybe the room I'm using in it, because I got the camera to look decent.

14:26.227 --> 14:33.091
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just very blurry still, but I mean, compared to the last digital camera that we had, the webcam, I guess it

14:34.015 --> 14:35.036
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know.

14:36.136 --> 14:37.696
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't just get this thing to work anymore.

14:38.157 --> 14:39.457
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll try it on my Xbox when we're done.

14:39.837 --> 14:41.518
[SPEAKER_02]: See if maybe the different lighting in this house will help.

14:41.838 --> 14:42.118
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

14:42.238 --> 14:43.138
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

14:44.099 --> 14:45.599
[SPEAKER_03]: It's worth picking up if you can find one.

14:46.279 --> 14:51.861
[SPEAKER_03]: I know GameStop, at least where I got mine pre-ordered at, they didn't get any extras in.

14:52.001 --> 14:53.342
[SPEAKER_03]: So it might be pretty hard to find.

14:55.062 --> 14:57.723
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not getting one.

14:57.743 --> 14:59.224
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not interested in the vision thing?

14:59.824 --> 14:59.964
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

15:00.164 --> 15:02.525
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want the whole vibration with the controller thing?

15:03.241 --> 15:04.661
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of funny when he did it.

15:04.942 --> 15:05.702
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, what the hell?

15:05.722 --> 15:06.742
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is the controller shaking?

15:07.462 --> 15:08.442
[SPEAKER_02]: And Loki's like, do you feel that?

15:08.462 --> 15:08.982
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel that?

15:10.783 --> 15:13.344
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a PC and I actually have a real webcam.

15:14.244 --> 15:16.964
[SPEAKER_04]: Which nobody is giving the address to since I don't upload it to anywhere.

15:17.224 --> 15:21.245
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can't play Uno with a webcam on the PC.

15:21.265 --> 15:22.946
[SPEAKER_02]: At least I don't know any versions of it yet.

15:23.066 --> 15:24.706
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't touch our Xbox 360.

15:26.327 --> 15:27.107
[SPEAKER_02]: What about Dead Rising?

15:27.667 --> 15:29.407
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I played that, but that was the last thing I played.

15:30.428 --> 15:31.828
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it was all about zombie killing.

15:33.257 --> 15:36.458
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been sort of not playing the 360.

15:36.598 --> 15:38.679
[SPEAKER_02]: No interest in Totem Ball or anything?

15:40.519 --> 15:40.899
[SPEAKER_02]: Pinball.

15:41.180 --> 15:41.500
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

15:41.540 --> 15:43.940
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of want one, but it can also kind of wait.

15:44.160 --> 15:47.541
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not something... I think I'll support many games for it right now.

15:47.601 --> 15:53.163
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I thought I would want it right away and I was kind of looking for one, but now I'm like, eh, do I really need to video chat?

15:53.363 --> 15:53.703
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

15:54.383 --> 15:56.064
[SPEAKER_02]: It can wait, especially after seeing Loki's.

15:56.284 --> 15:56.564
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

15:57.834 --> 15:58.814
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, my gaming week.

15:59.614 --> 16:00.995
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually not a lot of new stuff.

16:01.495 --> 16:03.515
[SPEAKER_02]: There really wasn't anything new I picked up this week.

16:03.715 --> 16:12.137
[SPEAKER_02]: I was interested in getting the camera at one point but I wasn't able to get it because I didn't pre-order one because I didn't think I would want it but then I was going to go look for it.

16:12.357 --> 16:12.837
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't have it.

16:13.417 --> 16:22.559
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've pretty much just been watching a friend of mine play through Enchanted Arms because I showed it to a friend of mine and he's been in love with it and just over here playing it a lot.

16:24.020 --> 16:26.240
[SPEAKER_02]: He got further than I did so I think he's about

16:26.820 --> 16:55.236
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the percentage said he was like 46% of the way through the game so some of the voice acting gets a little better when you get to midway some of the voice actors are pretty good and some are still pretty bad but the game's plot got interesting it's pretty fun I think if you're a role playing fan and you happen to have a 360 you should definitely check out Enchanted Arms because there's really not a lot else for you right now on the 360 and Enchanted Arms is decent it's not a hey we made this at the last minute so we could say we have an RPG on the system it's pretty good I was pretty happy

16:56.058 --> 16:58.019
[SPEAKER_02]: Drew Nami, how was your gaming week?

16:59.040 --> 17:00.781
[SPEAKER_01]: Oddly enough, I've been playing a lot of Rez.

17:02.162 --> 17:02.482
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

17:02.862 --> 17:03.402
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, really.

17:04.383 --> 17:07.185
[SPEAKER_01]: Aside from that, I haven't been really playing that many games.

17:07.245 --> 17:12.228
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a break from WoW and... Oh yeah, I've been playing World of Warcraft a lot, actually.

17:12.408 --> 17:13.208
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in a new guild.

17:13.228 --> 17:13.528
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn it.

17:13.789 --> 17:14.089
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

17:14.789 --> 17:21.053
[SPEAKER_02]: So, my friend convinced me to join the gay guild on Proudmoore, so I've been playing there a lot.

17:21.613 --> 17:21.973
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.

17:22.414 --> 17:23.054
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I took a break.

17:23.094 --> 17:24.035
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a little bit burned out.

17:24.435 --> 17:24.535
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

17:25.339 --> 17:28.101
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

17:52.338 --> 17:55.779
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you say to the people that say Kingdom Hearts 2 is nothing but a bunch of button mashing?

17:56.539 --> 17:59.680
[SPEAKER_01]: You haven't played it on proud mode, and you haven't gotten to Beast Castle Round 2.

18:01.721 --> 18:05.202
[SPEAKER_04]: As you said, I read some reviews that said... Even regular mode, the Demix battle.

18:06.182 --> 18:07.843
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Demix is just a pain in the ass.

18:07.863 --> 18:08.643
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just a bitch.

18:10.424 --> 18:10.704
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

18:11.304 --> 18:15.586
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's go on to some housekeeping, and then we're going to... Oh, I want to mention one thing that I thought was pretty cool.

18:15.826 --> 18:20.127
[SPEAKER_03]: GameStop, when I went and picked up my camera, I just looked around a little bit to see if there was anything else I wanted...

18:20.683 --> 18:26.607
[SPEAKER_03]: I found a Beatmania 2DX turntable controller for $8.

18:27.348 --> 18:28.208
[SPEAKER_03]: Pick that sucker up.

18:28.329 --> 18:29.049
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's mine.

18:29.850 --> 18:32.612
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, at least I'm babysitting it for a little while because Loki hates Beatmania.

18:32.812 --> 18:34.733
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I just don't have any games.

18:35.714 --> 18:38.516
[SPEAKER_03]: At the time, I didn't have my PlayStation 2 back, but I finally got it back.

18:39.156 --> 18:40.517
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have USB Mania?

18:40.537 --> 18:40.737
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

18:40.757 --> 18:41.278
[SPEAKER_02]: You can borrow that?

18:41.638 --> 18:46.482
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want, you can borrow my Japanese PlayStation and the various styles I own.

18:46.602 --> 18:47.222
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't own them all.

18:47.242 --> 18:48.183
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got my HD letter.

18:48.203 --> 18:49.164
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just load the Japanese.

18:49.244 --> 18:49.664
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well.

18:50.383 --> 18:53.406
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll put the new 2DX that they have in Japan over there on it.

18:53.807 --> 18:54.427
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well.

18:54.447 --> 18:56.950
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me for trying to do something nice.

18:56.970 --> 18:59.412
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just leave the controller here because I don't really play 2DX.

18:59.432 --> 19:01.014
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to play Doubles.

19:01.354 --> 19:02.716
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get back into 2DX and play Doubles.

19:02.736 --> 19:04.477
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Doubles Keyboard Mania was a blast.

19:04.638 --> 19:07.821
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you could play that in the arcade, people were like, WTF?

19:07.841 --> 19:08.982
[SPEAKER_02]: So many buttons.

19:09.002 --> 19:09.783
[SPEAKER_04]: Watching someone do 7-star.

19:14.961 --> 19:16.262
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was never as good.

19:16.342 --> 19:19.065
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I could get through a couple double songs, you know.

19:19.145 --> 19:20.026
[SPEAKER_02]: I was pretty decent.

19:20.086 --> 19:22.348
[SPEAKER_04]: I could do three stars, that was it, in doubles.

19:22.648 --> 19:25.151
[SPEAKER_02]: Who was that guy that is so good at keyboard mania?

19:25.191 --> 19:25.511
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue?

19:25.871 --> 19:26.312
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that his name?

19:26.472 --> 19:26.752
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

19:26.872 --> 19:33.799
[SPEAKER_02]: That guy, he can smoke those doubles that are like the maximum level, and I'll tell you what.

19:34.319 --> 19:35.781
[SPEAKER_04]: I loved watching him play keyboard mania, though.

19:36.061 --> 19:36.922
[SPEAKER_02]: That gives me...

19:38.556 --> 19:42.158
[SPEAKER_02]: A gamer boner so much more than the 2DX and pop music videos.

19:42.178 --> 19:43.318
[SPEAKER_04]: He also plays piano very well.

19:43.378 --> 19:45.519
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because I like the piano music a lot more.

19:45.579 --> 19:49.041
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm not disrespecting the 2DX because there's a lot of impressive stuff there.

19:49.061 --> 19:52.262
[SPEAKER_04]: You should also see him play Pump It Up.

19:52.282 --> 19:53.843
[SPEAKER_04]: You should also see him do doubles on Pump It Up.

19:54.243 --> 19:54.483
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

19:55.804 --> 19:56.484
[SPEAKER_02]: Someday, someday.

19:57.305 --> 19:57.825
[SPEAKER_02]: Housekeeping.

19:57.965 --> 20:04.548
[SPEAKER_02]: First, we want to thank everybody for all the well wishes for episode 200 because we continue to kind of get them throughout the week, even after the show.

20:04.608 --> 20:06.789
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a couple messages on Xbox Live, which is very nice.

20:07.313 --> 20:35.884
[SPEAKER_02]: and I know we got some emails and some message board posts so we just wanted to say thank you guys and it was a fun show it was a long show but it was a fun show and really glad you guys that were able to join us live did or if you couldn't join us live we're glad you got through all three parts so thank you also wanted to say the DDR sneak peeks are continuing tonight those haven't stopped they'll be a little later on in this program four new tracks two from Ultramix 4 and two from Universe and also I wanted to say about this podcast

20:36.792 --> 20:39.794
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

21:06.051 --> 21:13.774
[SPEAKER_02]: is he set up a program that not only catches podcasts and automatically shares them over the network to your Xbox 360.

21:13.814 --> 21:16.095
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't put them on the hard drive of the Xbox 360.

21:16.135 --> 21:16.875
[SPEAKER_02]: It uses the network.

21:17.235 --> 21:20.396
[SPEAKER_02]: But what it also does is it downloads RSS feeds.

21:20.496 --> 21:22.457
[SPEAKER_02]: Like let's say you want to read, I don't know, Kotaku.

21:22.737 --> 21:29.819
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say you have Kotaku in your feed, and what it does is it translates the text of the RSS feed and makes it an image.

21:30.600 --> 21:34.681
[SPEAKER_02]: And then so if you go through your photo gallery on Xbox 360, you can read RSS feeds.

21:35.216 --> 21:35.516
[SPEAKER_02]: XBeeStream.com

22:05.575 --> 22:07.076
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

22:35.424 --> 22:36.585
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

22:56.673 --> 22:58.815
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we shall go into some news, shall we Jamie?

22:58.835 --> 22:59.575
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, why don't we?

22:59.595 --> 23:01.217
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, I always shake my head because, you know what I call him?

23:01.237 --> 23:01.817
[SPEAKER_02]: I call him Ken Crayon Eater.

23:25.319 --> 23:32.063
[SPEAKER_04]: So apparently the price of the PlayStation 3 in Japan has been dropped.

23:34.204 --> 23:49.391
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though they're still having the delays with their production, they're stating that they're going to reprice the 20 gigabyte model with an inclusion of the HDMI port for 49,980 yen, which is roughly 48 bucks in the U.S.,

23:55.131 --> 24:01.154
[SPEAKER_04]: about 225 pounds in the UK, which is actually a reduction from 62,790 yen.

24:01.174 --> 24:06.797
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a pretty significant drop, at least, you know, a couple hundred.

24:08.198 --> 24:14.562
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're also saying that at the Tokyo Game Show there were going to be 200 playable consoles.

24:15.022 --> 24:19.224
[SPEAKER_04]: What I haven't found out is if they are actually still those rack-mounted servers.

24:20.265 --> 24:20.705
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they are.

24:21.305 --> 24:22.366
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I'm not surprised.

24:23.109 --> 24:35.838
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, one thing that was mentioned, and I found out after reading the article, a bit of a rebuttal on this, is that they're saying that the online service was going to offer Mega Drive and PC Engine titles, but Sega had something different to say about that, didn't they?

24:37.259 --> 24:37.920
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they did.

24:38.000 --> 24:46.926
[SPEAKER_03]: They said that it was something that they were considering based on the architecture of the online system, but it wasn't something that they were doing right away.

24:47.387 --> 24:49.348
[SPEAKER_04]: More proof that Ken Kurogi eats crayons.

24:50.616 --> 24:53.559
[SPEAKER_04]: However, one thing I do think is kind of cool is their global mapping system.

24:54.540 --> 25:02.486
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, what it does is you upload your pictures, data about where you live, and it makes a world map where various PS3 gamers live.

25:02.947 --> 25:05.389
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of neat.

25:05.789 --> 25:07.531
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like that one site.

25:07.571 --> 25:09.512
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that site?

25:09.893 --> 25:10.373
[SPEAKER_02]: Frapper.

25:10.393 --> 25:10.733
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

25:10.793 --> 25:11.094
[SPEAKER_02]: Frapper.

25:11.134 --> 25:11.674
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a Frapper.

25:11.694 --> 25:13.195
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we have an Orange Lounge Radio Frapper.

25:13.696 --> 25:15.337
[SPEAKER_02]: And you should join that if you haven't already.

25:15.397 --> 25:17.399
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it sounds like Frapper for your PS3.

25:17.619 --> 25:18.600
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting that impression.

25:20.131 --> 25:24.076
[SPEAKER_04]: But I still think that he needs to keep the bicycle helmet on a little bit longer.

25:25.018 --> 25:26.840
[SPEAKER_04]: His head hasn't quite healed from that last falling.

25:28.283 --> 25:30.025
[SPEAKER_03]: He's still got the baby soft spot.

25:30.406 --> 25:31.648
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

25:31.708 --> 25:33.530
[SPEAKER_04]: His skull hasn't completely molded together.

25:33.671 --> 25:34.572
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are crazy.

25:36.614 --> 25:46.382
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting because I'm reading about the XB Stream stuff in chat because apparently some of the other podcasters who were affected by that whole thing were very vocal about it and some of our folks listen to other podcasts.

25:46.682 --> 25:55.229
[SPEAKER_02]: I do try to listen to other podcasts, but ever since my iPod broke last week, it's been very hard for me to listen to other podcasts, so I'm kind of behind on all the gossip on XB Stream.

25:56.310 --> 25:58.492
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're saying, let's see, they said here,

25:59.255 --> 26:29.004
[SPEAKER_02]: something about GamerAndy loves XBStream I think there's a hint of sarcasm there Funnydale says XBStream nearly shut down IGN I'm not kidding and then Funnydale goes on to say wait shut down IGN on second thought I love XBStream but BlackWolf says reminds us that Tigerclaw or was saying to Tigerclaw I guess in a message here he offered to compensate for the bandwidth bills the author was like so you know oops I really made a big big mistake I'll pay for the bills I thought that was kind of nice you know so

26:30.645 --> 26:35.146
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, moving on, I wanted to say really quickly regarding the PlayStation 3.

26:36.367 --> 26:46.490
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an interesting series that Kotaku's been running, because they have some folks over at the show, and they've been posting these videos on YouTube asking people, do you want to get the Wii or the PlayStation 3?

26:47.510 --> 26:52.772
[SPEAKER_02]: Not sure why they didn't include the Xbox 360, but whatever, I guess maybe they figured that, you know, Xbox 360 is...

26:54.150 --> 26:54.570
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.

27:19.352 --> 27:21.354
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not seeing that same correlation.

27:21.815 --> 27:25.698
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is it about Japan and their love for the PlayStation 3?

27:26.599 --> 27:29.402
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the fact that Nintendo doesn't go to Tokyo Game Show?

27:29.442 --> 27:30.243
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll state the obvious there.

27:30.363 --> 27:39.371
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it maybe that people are just, you know, they're... Because the ooh and ahs of Sony being there, they're just loving that and that's kind of skewing their view a little bit, or what?

27:39.892 --> 27:43.816
[SPEAKER_04]: I think my old theory stands is it has to do with getting...

27:45.006 --> 27:45.606
[SPEAKER_04]: a Blu-ray.

27:45.866 --> 27:50.027
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, honestly, I think that the Japanese market is looking at the whole Blu-ray thing as a positive.

27:50.047 --> 27:59.230
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, having a DVD player in it is what sold the PS2 because at the time it was a lot cheaper to get a PS2 than to go out and just buy a DVD player.

28:00.931 --> 28:03.431
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that they're looking for that multiple functionality.

28:03.451 --> 28:04.852
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

28:05.112 --> 28:05.492
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

28:10.343 --> 28:23.694
[SPEAKER_02]: Fireboma says Tokyo Game Show is mostly fanboys Nintendo wasn't at Tokyo Game Show so their fans weren't there Nintendo Maniac 64 says the poll was probably done that way probably because the 360 is already out

28:24.355 --> 28:27.397
[SPEAKER_02]: So, okay, that makes sense why they didn't include 360 in the poll.

28:27.818 --> 28:37.865
[SPEAKER_02]: But what about some of those, well, I don't know, I can't remember if we get into it later in the program, but I'll just quickly say, what about some of those 360 games that are being shown at Tokyo Game Show?

28:37.945 --> 28:41.668
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, do you think that this might sway the Japanese public at all?

28:41.708 --> 28:46.412
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I was watching the demo for Blue Dragon, some of the gameplay video, it looked pretty hot.

28:46.932 --> 28:49.975
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know, is it going to be enough, or is it too little too late?

28:51.176 --> 28:51.696
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we'll see.

28:51.716 --> 28:52.116
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

28:52.817 --> 28:53.077
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

28:55.808 --> 29:04.858
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, as far as the PS3 itself, you know, where they were going to have the price drop in Japan, we are not quite so lucky here.

29:06.120 --> 29:12.107
[SPEAKER_04]: There's basically stating that there is no plans to drop the price in the United States.

29:12.607 --> 29:14.609
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still going to be $499 for the low end, $599 for the 60 gig version.

29:18.264 --> 29:24.090
[SPEAKER_04]: There hasn't been any set word if it's going to apply to Europe as well.

29:25.050 --> 29:27.773
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're still set for a 2007 launch in March.

29:29.574 --> 29:30.355
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty interesting.

29:30.535 --> 29:32.617
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of that might have to do with how it works here.

29:33.638 --> 29:36.000
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think if we have a crappy launch here in the U.S.

29:36.481 --> 29:41.205
[SPEAKER_02]: that Europe might get the price drop as incentive for them to go buy them?

29:41.647 --> 29:43.951
[SPEAKER_04]: It's possible, but that's not really how Sony plays.

29:44.172 --> 29:44.993
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.

29:45.274 --> 29:49.041
[SPEAKER_04]: One other thing, though, is that we are getting the HDMI slot on the low-end system.

29:50.421 --> 29:50.941
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

30:12.739 --> 30:13.059
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.

30:37.759 --> 30:42.422
[SPEAKER_03]: or maybe you do because it's actually a game that's already on the web for free.

30:43.262 --> 30:45.523
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of funny because they're trying to sell the game.

30:46.244 --> 30:47.765
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to say that it's a bad game.

30:47.805 --> 30:50.486
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually a pretty fun game and you can check it out online.

30:51.927 --> 30:53.248
[SPEAKER_03]: Just do a search for Flow.

30:53.288 --> 30:54.769
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pretty cool little thing.

30:54.789 --> 30:55.489
[SPEAKER_03]: They were talking about

30:56.249 --> 30:57.650
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually kind of an experiment.

30:58.130 --> 31:03.574
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if I do a search for Flow, I might get a lot of websites that aren't related to gaming at all.

31:04.034 --> 31:07.256
[SPEAKER_02]: So perhaps you might want to specify that search a little more.

31:07.777 --> 31:08.137
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

31:08.457 --> 31:12.960
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you want to play Flow in the wonderful Flash version, you can do so.

31:13.641 --> 31:16.503
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a couple different places to check it out.

31:16.683 --> 31:17.664
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one's going to be...

31:19.256 --> 31:32.822
[SPEAKER_03]: at inti.usc.edu slash cloud slash flowing slash core.html.

31:33.142 --> 31:34.863
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope you got a pen and paper for that one.

31:35.283 --> 31:37.084
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, rewind the show and write faster.

31:37.184 --> 31:37.744
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

31:38.744 --> 31:46.728
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, if you're looking for an easier way to actually play this, you can download copies, and I believe that there's one that's mirrored on PSP Updates.

31:47.677 --> 31:49.719
[SPEAKER_03]: or PS3 updates, I would imagine.

31:50.439 --> 32:02.930
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, so yeah, this game is going to be downloadable and supposedly you're going to have to purchase this, which is kind of funny because isn't this going to have a browser in it anyway?

32:02.990 --> 32:06.292
[SPEAKER_03]: So couldn't you, I don't know, go browse over to this website and play it for free?

32:07.073 --> 32:11.717
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that seems kind of retarded to me that you would be able to, I don't know,

32:13.405 --> 32:16.386
[SPEAKER_03]: Download this for free instead of paying for Sony's service.

32:16.426 --> 32:21.448
[SPEAKER_02]: That kind of defeats the purpose of... Well, what about all those Geometry Wars clones when they were out there?

32:21.528 --> 32:25.890
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you could play it for free, quote-unquote, online or on the other platforms.

32:25.910 --> 32:28.671
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but you can't play it for free on the PlayStation 3.

32:30.092 --> 32:34.834
[SPEAKER_03]: See, you can actually go with... Well, but you can't play Geometry Wars for free on the Xbox.

32:34.934 --> 32:36.134
[SPEAKER_03]: On the Xbox 360, that's what I'm saying.

32:36.314 --> 32:37.535
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can...

32:38.378 --> 32:50.043
[SPEAKER_03]: with the PlayStation 3, web browse over to this site and either download it to your hard drive and run it in Linux, or you could, I don't know, play it in the web browser, assuming that this thing supports Flash.

32:50.143 --> 32:55.845
[SPEAKER_03]: I would hope so, since it's a next-gen console with the fucking cell processor, it should be able to support Flash.

32:57.206 --> 32:58.486
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, you could play this game.

32:59.387 --> 33:02.068
[SPEAKER_03]: Ota G says, but, but, but, it's in HD!

33:03.268 --> 33:04.509
[SPEAKER_03]: But, but, but, who cares?

33:07.116 --> 33:10.639
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be in HD anyways, because it's going to be on your TV.

33:11.760 --> 33:12.080
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

33:12.340 --> 33:13.481
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think it's a waste of money.

33:14.082 --> 33:14.342
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

33:14.362 --> 33:21.688
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this was certainly a controversial story in the scene this week regarding the PlayStation 3, and it has to do with Gran Turismo HD.

33:22.779 --> 33:31.148
[SPEAKER_02]: And now there's these stories that have been going around about the fact that there's going to be this Gran Turismo HD Classic that's going to be, you know, kind of the entry into the GT series.

33:31.569 --> 33:38.176
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's going to be, I guess, 750 cars that you can download online for between 50 cents a dollar apiece.

33:38.256 --> 33:40.639
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically every... And there's 50 tracks between $1.50 and $4.50 apiece.

33:40.659 --> 33:41.200
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all the...

33:43.601 --> 33:47.862
[SPEAKER_03]: All the cars that have been basically created for the Gran Turismo series for the last 10 years.

33:48.042 --> 33:51.543
[SPEAKER_02]: But Gran Turismo HD Premium will come with 2 courses and 30 cars.

33:52.103 --> 33:52.383
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

33:52.644 --> 33:58.985
[SPEAKER_03]: The Premium is going to be basically kind of a test model for Gran Turismo 5.

33:59.725 --> 34:02.946
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically really detailed looking cars.

34:03.206 --> 34:05.127
[SPEAKER_03]: Think like Forza or something like that.

34:06.011 --> 34:07.832
[SPEAKER_03]: and just really nice stuff.

34:07.932 --> 34:14.116
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason why they don't have 750 cars in the premium version is because they haven't had a chance to create the models for all the cars yet.

34:14.456 --> 34:23.701
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really hurrying to get this game pushed out, which screams flaws up the ass.

34:24.301 --> 34:32.886
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, the classic version, I guess, is going to be an upscaled version of Gran Turismo 4 with all those wonderful cars to purchase.

34:33.615 --> 34:37.556
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're saying if I go to the store and buy this Gran Turismo Classic, I can't do anything with it?

34:37.616 --> 34:39.676
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Classic and Premium are in one game.

34:39.956 --> 34:40.656
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

34:40.756 --> 34:41.596
[SPEAKER_03]: It's different modes.

34:41.676 --> 34:42.817
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

34:43.017 --> 34:44.737
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I made it sound like it was two separate games.

34:45.057 --> 34:46.597
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's just one game.

34:46.677 --> 34:47.838
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, okay.

34:47.978 --> 34:57.599
[SPEAKER_03]: You will get some cars, but if you think about it, 30 cars and two tracks is a lot less than, say, 250 that I'm used to getting at the store for $49.99 for PlayStation 2.

34:57.639 --> 34:57.759
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh.

34:57.819 --> 34:58.219
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

34:58.239 --> 34:58.639
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

35:02.461 --> 35:05.183
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, what do you think about this microtransaction thing?

35:05.764 --> 35:06.364
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's the thing.

35:06.544 --> 35:08.666
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't stop at cars or tracks.

35:09.487 --> 35:13.189
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be adding parts and skins for your cars as well.

35:13.450 --> 35:15.751
[SPEAKER_03]: They want it to become the iTunes of Gran Turismo.

35:16.052 --> 35:21.516
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going to be spending thousands of dollars, hopefully, on this crap for one game.

35:22.998 --> 35:38.162
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think about Test Drive Unlimited, which is something I've been playing a lot recently that also has a crap load of cars and a crap load of parts and things that you can get with it, but you unlock them naturally as you go to the in-game store.

35:38.182 --> 35:40.023
[SPEAKER_02]: None of this microtransaction crap.

35:40.063 --> 35:42.303
[SPEAKER_02]: You buy the game and all this stuff is included.

35:42.343 --> 35:45.144
[SPEAKER_02]: You unlock it within the game, and that's what we're all kind of used to.

35:45.364 --> 35:47.145
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's the other fun thing about this, too.

35:47.465 --> 35:48.385
[SPEAKER_03]: They were saying that...

35:50.123 --> 36:03.815
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the cars in this are going to be expensive because they want you to actually be, you know, just kind of having that, I guess, you know, other people have expensive cars.

36:03.835 --> 36:06.097
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, I've got to have that expensive car.

36:06.617 --> 36:08.659
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually going to be expensive.

36:09.139 --> 36:11.421
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I get to buy horse armor for said car?

36:12.482 --> 36:14.063
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if it were a horse, maybe.

36:14.584 --> 36:18.347
[SPEAKER_03]: But the whole thing screams to me as a bad idea.

36:18.917 --> 36:23.979
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of people, I mean, they may be fans of Gran Turismo, but who's really going to pay for all the cars?

36:24.359 --> 36:28.981
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's just like saying, oh, here's Madden NFL.

36:29.241 --> 36:32.063
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, there's no teams or arenas included.

36:32.083 --> 36:33.643
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to purchase those separately.

36:34.544 --> 36:36.564
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, by the way, the football's not included either.

36:37.045 --> 36:43.407
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like buying a car without tires or an engine or seats or a body.

36:43.587 --> 36:45.028
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's retarded.

36:45.608 --> 36:47.349
[SPEAKER_03]: So what exactly am I paying for here?

36:48.240 --> 36:52.061
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerKalon's chat says, maybe you end up buying rims and spinners for the cars.

36:53.481 --> 36:55.862
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the other thing, too, about these cars.

36:56.762 --> 36:59.463
[SPEAKER_02]: Haz says, I want to buy a pine air freshener for my car.

37:00.523 --> 37:07.105
[SPEAKER_03]: Little fuzzy dice that can hang from the... I mean, why would you spend all this money on this?

37:07.805 --> 37:08.045
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

37:11.095 --> 37:12.736
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't see people doing this.

37:12.756 --> 37:19.821
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because I know they're really trying to push this microtransaction thing, and if it goes well, you can better believe that Gran Turismo 5 is going to be the same thing.

37:20.181 --> 37:27.065
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a possibility here that this whole thing's being grossly misinterpreted or something's wrong here?

37:27.325 --> 37:30.087
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know on the internet this week, it was a little bit back and forth.

37:30.167 --> 37:30.928
[SPEAKER_02]: Rumor, not rumor.

37:30.988 --> 37:37.552
[SPEAKER_03]: I've read a couple interviews, actually, with the head people for the lead on...

37:39.506 --> 37:41.108
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've confirmed this stuff.

37:41.188 --> 37:49.917
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the thing they haven't confirmed, they didn't say anything about the pricing on this and whether, you know, a lot of people aren't probably going to be buying 750 cars.

37:49.937 --> 37:50.478
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, you know, a fact.

37:52.864 --> 38:05.715
[SPEAKER_03]: But they didn't mention, you know, well, are there, you know, if I purchase, you know, say, a Honda Civic or something, and someone purchases a Lamborghini, I mean, am I going to have to purchase a, you know, more expensive car to be able to race against these people?

38:05.735 --> 38:09.418
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're going to be smoking me in this, you know, souped up car.

38:09.478 --> 38:19.527
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I think the whole thing's a bad idea, and I know there's been a lot of comparisons to Project Gotham Racing 3, but I kind of find it a little bit, you know,

38:20.037 --> 38:22.499
[SPEAKER_03]: That game does actually come with cars and tracks.

38:22.579 --> 38:27.381
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I think quite an unlimited amount of tracks since you can create your own courses in there.

38:27.862 --> 38:32.865
[SPEAKER_03]: But the fact is, I don't have to purchase these cars in order to be able to enjoy the game.

38:33.265 --> 38:39.429
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas if I want to play the online version of Classic, yes, you do have to purchase those cars, and yes, you do have to purchase those tracks.

38:39.889 --> 38:44.772
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's kind of retarded that I should have to spend money on a game that I already spent money on.

38:45.839 --> 38:46.239
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

38:46.299 --> 38:47.540
[SPEAKER_02]: More interesting comments from chat.

38:47.560 --> 38:48.381
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just lit up on this.

38:48.701 --> 38:54.885
[SPEAKER_02]: Funnydale says, Sony is going to make players of Gran Turismo HD pay $5 a gallon for virtual gasoline.

38:55.185 --> 38:57.126
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 3, this is really living.

38:59.208 --> 38:59.468
[SPEAKER_02]: Funny.

39:00.168 --> 39:03.170
[SPEAKER_02]: Stickaxe, you know, a little bit of a counterpoint here.

39:03.711 --> 39:09.674
[SPEAKER_02]: If the game was cheap, and if I only like a few tracks, I don't have to spend $40 for a game I only want half of.

39:11.436 --> 39:11.696
[SPEAKER_03]: True.

39:11.976 --> 39:12.056
[SPEAKER_03]: And

39:12.850 --> 39:21.133
[SPEAKER_03]: And the whole thing is, you know, the Gran Turismo HD Premium or whatever, it's just a fucking demo for Gran Turismo 5 is basically what it is.

39:21.793 --> 39:29.436
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, why should I pay for an upscaled version of 4, seeing as you can buy 4 and upscale it anyways, you know, ver-

39:30.303 --> 39:30.863
[SPEAKER_03]: Why the hell?

39:31.264 --> 39:35.346
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, first off, if I were ever to buy a PlayStation 3, I would never be buying this game at all.

39:35.506 --> 39:37.747
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I would not touch this game with a 10-foot pole.

39:38.287 --> 39:41.209
[SPEAKER_03]: I would wait for a better racing game to come out, because you know what?

39:41.229 --> 39:43.010
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be a lot more out there.

39:43.490 --> 39:49.353
[SPEAKER_01]: The only way I could ever see this selling is if it were like $10 for the core of it, and then everything else you can pay for.

39:49.933 --> 39:55.116
[SPEAKER_03]: If it were like, you know, you can buy 200 cars for $20 or something like that, then maybe, yeah.

39:55.552 --> 39:56.533
[SPEAKER_03]: Project Gotham 3 Car Packets

40:13.399 --> 40:14.580
[SPEAKER_04]: Project Gossam

40:37.672 --> 40:39.134
[SPEAKER_02]: Project Gotham 3 packs.

40:39.215 --> 40:42.660
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it because Project Gotham 3 actually is a full game without them?

40:42.800 --> 40:43.741
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a full game.

40:43.781 --> 40:47.547
[SPEAKER_03]: You do not need to have these cars in order to enjoy the game.

40:48.648 --> 40:49.730
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of an added bonus.

40:49.770 --> 40:52.594
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to buy the cars, then yeah, you can go ahead and do that.

40:53.177 --> 40:54.598
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

41:16.997 --> 41:20.439
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're going to leave with a couple chat comments here, and then we'll move on here.

41:20.679 --> 41:22.539
[SPEAKER_02]: Gita in chat says, I don't really care.

41:22.760 --> 41:24.160
[SPEAKER_02]: Waiting for Need for Speed Carbon.

41:24.740 --> 41:27.361
[SPEAKER_02]: And NintendoManiac64 says, Excite Truck for the win.

41:28.142 --> 41:30.923
[SPEAKER_02]: So, sounds like some people are just going to take their money elsewhere.

41:31.003 --> 41:31.423
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

41:32.304 --> 41:32.924
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anyways.

41:35.065 --> 41:42.608
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually some interesting stuff coming out other than Gran Turismo HD, and that is our favorite game to talk about, Africa.

41:43.895 --> 41:45.757
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell is Africa?

41:46.157 --> 41:49.739
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's kind of funny because it's actually kind of what we thought it would be.

41:50.040 --> 41:55.704
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically a virtual African safari where you can take pictures and basically keep them.

41:57.005 --> 41:58.666
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Pokemon Snap with giraffes.

41:59.026 --> 42:03.450
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, but it's not really a game though.

42:04.230 --> 42:09.274
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically a virtual safari, virtual Africa where you get to see animals.

42:09.881 --> 42:13.085
[SPEAKER_03]: and basically experience Africa without going to Africa.

42:13.205 --> 42:15.689
[SPEAKER_03]: Did Elton John do the music and Tim Rice the lyrics?

42:16.289 --> 42:16.690
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

42:16.810 --> 42:17.211
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't care.

42:17.311 --> 42:17.811
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

42:18.252 --> 42:20.435
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Jumbo Safari because you can harpoon animals.

42:21.377 --> 42:22.037
[SPEAKER_04]: Jumbo Safari Jumbo Safari

42:44.747 --> 42:47.969
[SPEAKER_03]: In studio, I have the trailer running right now for Africa.

42:48.329 --> 42:50.390
[SPEAKER_03]: And granted, it looks fucking amazing.

42:50.730 --> 42:51.491
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's pretty.

42:51.851 --> 42:55.613
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very pretty, but the thing is, it's like, what the hell is this?

42:55.733 --> 42:57.874
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just, okay, it's Africa.

42:59.455 --> 43:00.876
[SPEAKER_03]: There's grass.

43:01.056 --> 43:01.737
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Barons.

43:02.537 --> 43:03.838
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's birds and stuff.

43:04.118 --> 43:04.938
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Chuck Norris.

43:05.419 --> 43:07.480
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's the Barons without Chuck Norris jokes.

43:07.520 --> 43:08.140
[SPEAKER_03]: What more do you need?

43:08.500 --> 43:10.121
[SPEAKER_03]: So granted, okay, great.

43:10.201 --> 43:10.762
[SPEAKER_03]: It's elephants.

43:10.862 --> 43:12.843
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Discovery Channel, you know.

43:13.777 --> 43:17.380
[SPEAKER_03]: That's basically kind of what it seems to me to be, but I don't know.

43:17.420 --> 43:21.602
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we really want, you know, do you really need to like buy this stuff?

43:22.563 --> 43:24.224
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the game I would recommend buying.

43:24.444 --> 43:26.105
[SPEAKER_03]: Cabela's African Safari.

43:26.125 --> 43:29.388
[SPEAKER_03]: You get to go destroy, you know, elephants and rhinos and stuff.

43:29.408 --> 43:30.829
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you see like the predators eat other animals?

43:31.109 --> 43:33.270
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they have cheetahs and stuff.

43:33.370 --> 43:39.034
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see like the whole true circle of life where like they eat animals.

43:39.094 --> 43:39.635
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, hyenas.

43:40.575 --> 43:41.396
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Africa...

43:41.803 --> 43:43.484
[SPEAKER_03]: And look at their eating animals.

43:43.504 --> 43:46.126
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at the cute hyena eating the carcass.

43:47.747 --> 43:49.568
[SPEAKER_02]: And then suddenly out of nowhere, Crikey!

43:49.748 --> 43:51.289
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wait, bad taste, sorry, bad taste.

43:51.349 --> 43:52.470
[SPEAKER_02]: A stingray through my heart!

43:53.330 --> 43:53.870
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad taste.

43:54.111 --> 43:55.812
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the hippo wiggling his little ears.

43:55.832 --> 43:56.952
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it looks great.

43:56.992 --> 43:58.854
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this looks really, really good.

43:58.974 --> 44:02.816
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, I think that, you know, they should do... Yeah, but maybe this is just the opening movie.

44:02.876 --> 44:04.757
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, how often do we get pissed off at that?

44:05.137 --> 44:09.260
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, you see the opening movie, and then, like, the game looks nothing like it.

44:09.482 --> 44:09.962
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

44:10.162 --> 44:13.624
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you mean like, kind of like, uh, oh, I don't know, Motorstorm?

44:14.864 --> 44:15.765
Ooh, pretty.

44:16.025 --> 44:23.568
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so granted, okay, this is, you know, really cool and stuff, but I don't know, I don't know if this- It does look amazing.

44:23.988 --> 44:26.349
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, graphically, it's, but yeah, what the hell is it?

44:26.369 --> 44:28.970
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I don't need tech demos as a fucking game.

44:30.911 --> 44:32.171
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're the same- Wait a minute.

44:32.191 --> 44:33.672
[SPEAKER_04]: They cut it off before he ate the gazelle.

44:33.872 --> 44:37.473
[SPEAKER_02]: Aren't you the same person that said you were wanting to get a copy of Wii Play from Japan?

44:37.493 --> 44:38.133
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because that's fun.

44:38.154 --> 44:39.294
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want tech demos as a game.

44:40.595 --> 44:45.297
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, tech demos as in like, okay, here's ducks, okay, and look at the ducks.

44:46.978 --> 44:48.419
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, Jeremy Todd 1 is great.

44:48.799 --> 44:49.259
[SPEAKER_03]: What'd he say?

44:49.780 --> 44:54.122
[SPEAKER_04]: In Africa, you will be able to hunt down your favorite species of rare animals and take pictures of them.

44:54.522 --> 44:59.845
[SPEAKER_04]: On rare nights, usually nights with a full moon, you will be able to see Chuck Norris running around killing elephants with his bare hands.

45:00.245 --> 45:01.846
[SPEAKER_04]: Take a picture for massive damage.

45:04.327 --> 45:05.108
[SPEAKER_04]: That was beautiful.

45:05.548 --> 45:06.068
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

45:06.088 --> 45:07.329
[SPEAKER_04]: You win the chatroom cookie.

45:08.209 --> 45:09.690
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like I said, you know,

45:12.693 --> 45:13.554
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a nice game.

45:14.434 --> 45:18.016
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that there's more to it than just look at the pretty animals.

45:18.336 --> 45:20.157
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know.

45:20.317 --> 45:23.259
[SPEAKER_04]: I sort of think that I would play that.

45:23.459 --> 45:27.160
[SPEAKER_04]: But then again, I also did play a whole bunch of Pokemon Snap.

45:27.701 --> 45:33.043
[SPEAKER_04]: But something that I will play, because I'm probably going to get a PS3, is Ninja Gaiden.

45:33.324 --> 45:34.084
[SPEAKER_04]: Ninja Gaiden.

45:35.137 --> 45:45.422
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming out on PS3, according to Famitsu, there is going to be one called Ninja Gaiden Sigma, which you will play as Rachel from Ninja Gaiden Black.

45:48.463 --> 45:55.486
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was actually also revealed that Itagaki was saying that there was going to be a Ninja Gaiden 2 version,

45:56.461 --> 45:59.364
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't stating that it was the same project.

46:00.765 --> 46:06.549
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also a theory that this is going to be a remake of Ninja Gaiden Black with extras.

46:07.870 --> 46:14.116
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's also been no statement on if it's going to be specific just to the PS3 or if it will see multiple systems.

46:14.196 --> 46:15.437
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it'll see multiple systems.

46:17.418 --> 46:17.959
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably.

46:17.979 --> 46:25.084
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know Ninja Gaiden Black did really well on the Xbox, so I wouldn't see why they wouldn't try to make a 360 version

46:26.089 --> 46:28.611
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

46:52.788 --> 46:57.172
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the demo thing because they did it during E3 and got some pretty good demos from that.

46:57.252 --> 47:00.394
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully you're going to see some more stuff as far as demos go.

47:00.434 --> 47:05.298
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that their Sonic the Hedgehog is supposed to be next week at some point so that would be cool.

47:06.119 --> 47:10.142
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe even some more Japanese exclusive demos would be nice because I get to play those anyways.

47:12.104 --> 47:13.645
[SPEAKER_03]: Just stuff like that.

47:15.126 --> 47:19.550
[SPEAKER_03]: I like how they're doing this and hopefully we'll see some more stuff that come out pretty soon.

47:20.731 --> 47:31.437
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, as far as things that are coming out relatively soon, at the Tokyo Game Show, Microsoft had a press release stating what new live arcade games were going to be coming out.

47:32.097 --> 47:39.461
[SPEAKER_04]: Included were Contra, Gyruss, Dig Dug, Track and Field, New Rally X, Russian Attack, Ms.

47:39.481 --> 47:43.022
[SPEAKER_04]: Pac-Man, and exclusive for the Japanese audience, Yaya Kung Fu.

47:45.324 --> 47:45.804
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.

47:46.431 --> 47:49.932
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if I can play that since I have my Japanese account, you know.

47:50.232 --> 47:50.772
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't bother.

47:51.352 --> 47:52.372
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like Yarkung Fu.

47:52.412 --> 47:54.453
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of people have a lot of love for that game.

47:54.673 --> 47:58.293
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's this amazing fighting game people make it out to be.

47:59.294 --> 48:01.494
[SPEAKER_04]: It's what practically started the genre.

48:03.094 --> 48:03.595
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll try it.

48:03.955 --> 48:04.275
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

48:04.495 --> 48:05.075
[SPEAKER_03]: Not my favorite.

48:05.135 --> 48:09.856
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, they do have the free demo versions you can try out.

48:10.196 --> 48:12.136
[SPEAKER_03]: Gyrus, on the other hand, bring it.

48:12.696 --> 48:13.617
[SPEAKER_02]: Freaking love Gyrus.

48:13.717 --> 48:15.557
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so there when Gyrus comes out.

48:16.499 --> 48:22.783
[SPEAKER_03]: Now some interesting things were found out actually this week, or at least have been brought to light.

48:23.303 --> 48:31.789
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that you can download or copy your Xbox Live arcade games onto a CD-R or DVD-R and be able to play them on your system.

48:32.229 --> 48:33.209
[SPEAKER_03]: Now why is this important?

48:33.269 --> 48:37.272
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not everyone out there has a hard drive for their system, as much as I'd like to think so.

48:38.656 --> 48:42.018
[SPEAKER_03]: and also that the memory units are quite limited on what you can put on there.

48:42.358 --> 48:48.383
[SPEAKER_03]: Now there's a big huge kind of how-to on 360gamesaves.com if you want to know how to do this.

48:48.983 --> 48:57.090
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's kind of funny, this is one of the things that they actually have been able to do is pull off the full version of Hexic HD.

48:57.150 --> 49:00.252
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you don't have a hard drive, you can actually play it on your system.

49:00.792 --> 49:06.517
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's basically as simple as bringing them into a certain directory structure on your PC

49:08.187 --> 49:14.912
[SPEAKER_03]: and basically popping it in and they will populate your Xbox Live Arcade list there, which is pretty cool.

49:15.292 --> 49:20.356
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you do have them registered on your system, they will be the full version, otherwise they are a demo.

49:22.717 --> 49:24.399
[SPEAKER_02]: So when might somebody want to actually use this?

49:26.060 --> 49:34.126
[SPEAKER_03]: If they don't have a hard drive or if they're just stuck to just a simple memory unit, they might, I don't know, if they have the extra...

49:34.960 --> 49:35.521
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.com

49:51.300 --> 49:59.802
[SPEAKER_03]: does the kind of not legit thing and takes all the demos and puts them on a disk image and, you know, distributes that over the internet, which would be cool.

50:00.082 --> 50:15.646
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that should be something that Microsoft should do anyways, because I know that, well, I know they were trying to push their Xbox Live Arcade Unplugged, but, you know, this way, if you could download all the demos, say, to a disk image, kind of like how they have the backwards compatibility updates, that would be pretty cool as well.

50:15.666 --> 50:20.967
[SPEAKER_03]: And you just burn it onto the disk and then pop it in there and you have all the demos for all the games and then you can just, you know,

50:21.789 --> 50:23.150
[SPEAKER_03]: Register them, I guess, somehow.

50:24.210 --> 50:26.032
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of a problem if you don't have live, I guess.

50:27.312 --> 50:28.873
[SPEAKER_03]: And how is piracy going to be prevented again?

50:30.074 --> 50:38.679
[SPEAKER_03]: The way piracy is prevented on it is actually that you're not going to be able to... The games are only demo versions unless it's registered to your account.

50:39.240 --> 50:39.580
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

50:40.300 --> 50:46.404
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, because sometimes I start up Geometry Wars and it looks like it's a demo and then suddenly it switches over and it says, oh, never mind, it's a demo version.

50:46.444 --> 50:49.506
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because whether they're registered or not is based on your account.

50:49.966 --> 50:51.547
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't just download a registered version.

50:53.208 --> 50:57.189
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, speaking of the 360, we have a very exciting announcement for the 360.

50:57.789 --> 51:02.030
[SPEAKER_02]: At least I know a lot of our import game fans are going to love this because these were huge games.

51:02.050 --> 51:05.190
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they were released here too, but it seems to appeal to that same audience.

51:05.951 --> 51:08.451
[SPEAKER_02]: Radiant Silvergun and Ikaruga.

51:08.811 --> 51:10.732
[SPEAKER_02]: You might recognize these two shooter titles.

51:11.112 --> 51:15.792
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, did you know that this was always planned to be a trilogy?

51:17.013 --> 51:17.853
[SPEAKER_02]: And guess what?

51:17.913 --> 51:18.313
[SPEAKER_02]: Treasure...

51:19.348 --> 51:24.670
[SPEAKER_02]: has announced that they will be making a third game in the series for the Xbox 360.

51:25.330 --> 51:25.910
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all we know.

51:25.930 --> 51:26.590
[SPEAKER_07]: Treasure loves us.

51:26.870 --> 51:27.610
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all we know.

51:27.650 --> 51:31.111
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know when, where, how, what.

51:31.351 --> 51:34.192
[SPEAKER_02]: We just know that Treasure's making it, and it's coming to the 360.

51:34.912 --> 51:37.213
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I love Radiant Silvergun so much.

51:37.513 --> 51:39.213
[SPEAKER_02]: So now will you play your 360, Jamie?

51:39.594 --> 51:40.014
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes!

51:40.354 --> 51:41.074
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god!

51:42.236 --> 51:47.540
[SPEAKER_04]: I played the hell out of Radiant Silvergun at that one arcade in Las Vegas before they shut down.

51:48.340 --> 51:49.581
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, Radiant Silvergun?

51:49.841 --> 51:51.583
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone else is off playing Mambo at GoGo.

51:51.783 --> 51:52.803
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, screw that.

51:53.764 --> 51:54.345
[SPEAKER_04]: Radiant Silvergun?

51:54.725 --> 51:55.665
[SPEAKER_04]: They couldn't get me off the machine.

51:55.946 --> 52:05.632
[SPEAKER_02]: What's interesting about that, I think, is that those games are usually very vertical in nature, yet now the Xbox 360 supports widescreen and all their games have to support widescreen.

52:06.013 --> 52:10.636
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to be interesting what all that new horizontalness does to the game, don't you think?

52:11.258 --> 52:15.101
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually am sort of foreseeing something like, what was it, Thunder Force 5?

52:15.441 --> 52:20.204
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't that one have a lot of the rotational, where it would go one way and then rotate the other way?

52:21.185 --> 52:23.367
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it wasn't Thunder Force 5, maybe I'm thinking of Einhander.

52:24.447 --> 52:28.030
[SPEAKER_03]: Einhander did a lot of vertical and horizontal scrolling in their games.

52:28.410 --> 52:29.631
[SPEAKER_03]: And Salamander.

52:29.831 --> 52:31.252
[SPEAKER_04]: Salamander actually did both, too.

52:31.652 --> 52:32.973
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to make a new Einhander.

52:33.434 --> 52:34.014
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about time.

52:34.174 --> 52:35.435
[SPEAKER_04]: If they do it, it'd be Zweihander.

52:35.455 --> 52:36.576
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

52:37.737 --> 52:37.877
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

52:37.917 --> 52:38.017
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

52:39.258 --> 52:41.280
[SPEAKER_04]: So, how about some release dates, y'all?

52:41.801 --> 52:46.185
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, of course, we will start off with our UK release dates.

52:46.826 --> 52:48.708
[SPEAKER_04]: Some okay stuff, I guess.

52:49.548 --> 52:56.996
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it would help if my laptop wouldn't come unplugged when I'm trying to pull up the dates.

52:57.998 --> 53:00.699
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry guys, I just got a little bit of a hang up.

53:01.100 --> 53:02.300
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the internet's acting funny tonight.

53:02.320 --> 53:03.821
[SPEAKER_02]: Our chat room's all crazy tonight.

53:04.201 --> 53:05.722
[SPEAKER_02]: Live radio, folks.

53:05.842 --> 53:07.643
[SPEAKER_04]: The internet's not acting funny for me.

53:08.323 --> 53:11.545
[SPEAKER_04]: The fact that my computer came unplugged and my battery was going WTF.

53:12.725 --> 53:15.406
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so how about our UK release dates?

53:15.767 --> 53:16.167
[SPEAKER_04]: Take two.

53:17.407 --> 53:25.411
[SPEAKER_04]: On the 25th, which it probably already is in the UK, Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2 March of the Minis coming out.

53:25.651 --> 53:25.892
[SPEAKER_04]: On the 29th,

53:28.499 --> 53:55.064
[SPEAKER_04]: 42 all-time classics coming out on the DS, Age of Empires, Age of Kings, Black Buccaneer on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation 2, Company of Heroes on PC, Devil May Cry 3, Dante's Awakening, Special Edition, that's a cool game, guys, get it, Infrared, and Kingdom Hearts 2 coming out on PlayStation 2, Mercury Meltdown also on the 30th, Mad Tracks coming out on Xbox 360.

53:56.244 --> 53:56.624
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.

53:57.473 --> 53:59.154
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some pretty cool stuff coming out.

53:59.534 --> 54:01.895
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope Bad Trax is coming out, because that'd be pretty awesome.

54:01.935 --> 54:03.316
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to play that.

54:04.717 --> 54:15.562
[SPEAKER_03]: For, of course, I've got to mention this first, the big game for the PlayStation 2 this week, Dance Dance Revolution Supernova, of course, will be coming out.

54:16.562 --> 54:18.944
[SPEAKER_03]: I have heard, though, that the bundle might be delayed.

54:19.044 --> 54:24.186
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you don't have a dance pad yet, which I don't see why you wouldn't, you might be waiting a little bit.

54:25.547 --> 54:25.907
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course,

54:26.773 --> 54:34.115
[SPEAKER_03]: On the PlayStation 2, we also have, or actually PlayStation 2, Xbox, the 360, and PSP, NBA Live 07.

54:34.455 --> 54:39.517
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if you're not a fan of Live, NBA 2K7 is coming out on PlayStation 2, Xbox, and the 360.

54:39.937 --> 54:45.779
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're not a fan of basketball, maybe you're a fan of racing games, in which case you've got a couple things.

54:45.879 --> 54:50.580
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one's going to be the Fast and the Furious on PlayStation 2, loosely based on Tokyo Drift.

54:51.380 --> 54:55.582
[SPEAKER_03]: And Import Tuner Challenge on the Xbox 360.

54:57.661 --> 55:00.883
[SPEAKER_03]: which there was a rumor that that was going to be $29.99 at Best Buy.

55:01.503 --> 55:03.365
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a typo.

55:04.125 --> 55:12.350
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, of course, Just Cause will be coming out on Xbox 360, the Xbox and PlayStation 2, as well as the PC.

55:13.991 --> 55:15.272
[SPEAKER_03]: And some other fun stuff.

55:15.312 --> 55:24.217
[SPEAKER_03]: On the GameCube, Beiten and Kato's Origins will be coming out, one of the last role-playing games actually made by Nintendo for the GameCube, so check that out.

55:24.757 --> 55:25.418
[SPEAKER_03]: As well as...

55:26.502 --> 55:33.927
[SPEAKER_03]: The Game Boy Advance will be getting some re-releases, including Pokemon FireRed as part of the greatest hits, and LeafGreen.

55:35.468 --> 55:40.211
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, there's some pretty good stuff coming out.

55:41.612 --> 55:46.415
[SPEAKER_03]: Ford Boldmoves Street Racing, if you're a racing fan on the PlayStation 2, kind of a budget game.

55:46.796 --> 55:52.519
[SPEAKER_03]: And Greg Hastings Tournament Paintball Max, which the game is about a year old now, but still, you might want to play it.

55:52.960 --> 55:54.641
[SPEAKER_03]: And Valkyrie Profile 2, Symera.

55:55.620 --> 55:56.200
[SPEAKER_03]: on the PlayStation 2.

56:23.331 --> 56:25.375
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think that's funny, a game about an MMO

56:33.740 --> 56:34.741
[SPEAKER_03]: and the game Live Radio Kids.

56:57.311 --> 57:02.153
[SPEAKER_03]: as well as a generic fishing game on July 18th of 07.

57:02.533 --> 57:19.720
[SPEAKER_03]: GISH for the PSP is coming out February 28th of 07, as well as a Guilty Gear title for the PlayStation 2, entitled right now Guilty Gear Series, but I guess that's a working title for that, and that's coming out January 2nd, so look for those.

57:20.281 --> 57:24.442
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are in the market for some Xbox 360 games, there's been a few price drops.

57:25.343 --> 57:25.623
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick 4...

57:26.510 --> 57:27.611
[SPEAKER_03]: X-Men The Official Game of the Movie

57:50.427 --> 57:51.788
[SPEAKER_03]: Melgear Solid Portable Ops.

57:52.008 --> 57:57.391
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the cool things though that we probably won't ever see over here is going to be a Portable Ops bundle for the PSP.

57:58.131 --> 58:06.776
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're really trying to sell the PSP since they're getting their asses handed to them by Nintendo with the DS.

58:07.096 --> 58:19.243
[SPEAKER_03]: The wonderful little bundle is going to include a snakeskin patterned case as well as the game and a fun little box that comes

58:19.659 --> 58:20.239
[SPEAKER_03]: with everything.

58:20.319 --> 58:25.981
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you haven't gotten a PSP already and you're thinking about doing so, definitely check it out.

58:26.441 --> 58:29.062
[SPEAKER_04]: Comes with a box of cigarettes and Snake's favorite brand?

58:29.522 --> 58:29.662
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

58:29.863 --> 58:30.043
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

58:30.343 --> 58:38.045
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually, it does come with an additional pouch with the, looks like the logo for the game on it as well.

58:38.445 --> 58:46.188
[SPEAKER_03]: But other than that, no real additional bonuses to it other than kind of a cool-looking PSP box.

58:46.568 --> 58:48.589
[SPEAKER_04]: Airsoft sniper rifle, you know.

58:49.944 --> 58:58.746
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, well, speaking of very cool things, Guitar Hero is going to be making it to multiple formats in 2007.

58:58.806 --> 59:04.427
[SPEAKER_04]: So that means that y'all who missed out are going to be having your second chance.

59:05.487 --> 59:16.729
[SPEAKER_04]: It has been announced by the chairman of Activision that, and this is a quote, that it will appear on every significant new format.

59:18.045 --> 59:26.274
[SPEAKER_04]: while also going into some of the information about their general plan from what it looks like as far as some of their other titles.

59:29.057 --> 59:36.746
[SPEAKER_04]: There hasn't been an official comment by Red Octane, but they did say 2007, and also Guitar Hero 2 is supposed to be out in November.

59:37.611 --> 59:39.713
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't that seem like a vague statement, though?

59:39.833 --> 59:41.734
[SPEAKER_02]: Every significant new platform?

59:41.934 --> 59:44.276
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean... Well, what's their idea of significant?

59:44.336 --> 59:44.897
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

59:45.557 --> 59:47.359
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they like the Wonderswan.

59:47.699 --> 59:50.321
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, maybe they just mean it ain't coming for the Phantom.

59:50.421 --> 59:50.681
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

59:50.781 --> 59:55.585
[SPEAKER_04]: Do not say hoo-hoo about the Wonderswan because it had the best home version of Beatmania.

59:56.186 --> 59:57.727
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the best portable version of Beatmania.

59:58.708 --> 01:00:01.770
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this too much Guitar Hero?

01:00:03.291 --> 01:00:04.933
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this going to be an oversaturation of the market?

01:00:05.533 --> 01:00:05.833
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah.

01:00:05.853 --> 01:00:06.754
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah?

01:00:07.301 --> 01:00:07.561
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

01:00:08.222 --> 01:00:08.442
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes?

01:00:08.762 --> 01:00:10.163
[SPEAKER_03]: I just thought I'd say that.

01:00:11.064 --> 01:00:24.215
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so, because, I mean, really, it's gonna... I think Guitar Hero's gonna go the same path as Guitar Freaks, where, I mean, even though they still make tons of games for that, it's just, what are you gonna have?

01:00:24.275 --> 01:00:30.580
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not really gonna be able to innovate on the gameplay any, so it's just gonna be brand new music each time around.

01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:33.163
[SPEAKER_03]: And, I mean, well, I guess DDR... I mean, DDR does...

01:00:34.144 --> 01:00:34.765
[SPEAKER_03]: SoCalibur 2

01:00:58.821 --> 01:01:03.602
[SPEAKER_04]: is, you know, where Soul Calibur 2 had different special characters on each game.

01:01:04.022 --> 01:01:08.143
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a certain packet of songs on each game that's exclusive to just that one.

01:01:08.203 --> 01:01:08.703
[SPEAKER_02]: God, no.

01:01:08.743 --> 01:01:09.743
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'd have to buy them all.

01:01:11.544 --> 01:01:12.244
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do that.

01:01:13.244 --> 01:01:14.985
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but wouldn't that sell more games?

01:01:15.625 --> 01:01:15.965
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

01:01:15.985 --> 01:01:19.706
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, you know, really... I did own every version of Soul Calibur 2.

01:01:20.186 --> 01:01:26.487
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see how well 2 does, because, I mean, 2... People are going to be having, you know, the buy 2, and they're going to be like,

01:01:28.223 --> 01:01:30.825
[SPEAKER_03]: They might just go, okay, I've seen this before.

01:01:31.545 --> 01:01:31.925
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

01:01:32.325 --> 01:01:32.765
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

01:01:32.825 --> 01:01:35.307
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's got a huge enough fan base the game's going to do very well.

01:01:35.647 --> 01:01:37.908
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the game's going to do very, very well this Christmas.

01:01:39.128 --> 01:01:39.549
[SPEAKER_02]: What do I know?

01:01:40.509 --> 01:01:46.592
[SPEAKER_02]: I do know that an interesting story that somewhat relates to this is that a very interesting purchase has been made.

01:01:47.552 --> 01:01:51.854
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, a while ago it kind of turned heads when Activision acquired Red Octane.

01:01:51.874 --> 01:01:53.435
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now the other...

01:01:54.088 --> 01:01:55.171
[SPEAKER_02]: Harmonix, MTV Networks

01:02:04.392 --> 01:02:05.413
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.

01:02:05.453 --> 01:02:14.599
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, earlier this week, MTV announced a definitive agreement to acquire Harmonix Music Systems, developer of Guitar Hero, on behalf of MTV.

01:02:14.999 --> 01:02:20.923
[SPEAKER_02]: Under the terms of the transaction, MTV acquires all of the outstanding stock of Harmonix for $175 million in cash.

01:02:21.384 --> 01:02:29.149
[SPEAKER_02]: Harmonix shareholders may be eligible for incremental earn-out payments through 2008 to the extent that financial results exceed specific targets.

01:02:30.029 --> 01:02:33.652
[SPEAKER_02]: This is to demonstrate MTV's commitment to music and

01:02:34.178 --> 01:02:36.419
[SPEAKER_02]: You can play videos if you want to demonstrate that.

01:02:36.899 --> 01:02:43.722
[SPEAKER_02]: And furthers its strategy of engaging passionate music fans through a deep and immersive multi-platform entertainment experience.

01:02:44.122 --> 01:02:45.642
[SPEAKER_02]: Summary, we're screwed.

01:02:46.963 --> 01:02:52.345
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, this means that MTV Games' logo will soon show up on Guitar Hero.

01:02:52.365 --> 01:02:53.065
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be interesting.

01:02:54.466 --> 01:02:57.187
[SPEAKER_02]: But could it allow them to get better licenses for the game?

01:02:58.732 --> 01:03:03.635
[SPEAKER_01]: Possibly, but I can't really see the game getting much better if MTV's label is slapped on it.

01:03:03.695 --> 01:03:05.977
[SPEAKER_02]: Could they finally get Metallica?

01:03:07.758 --> 01:03:08.239
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:03:08.599 --> 01:03:11.741
[SPEAKER_04]: Metallica can be kind of, you know, pissy when it comes to their music.

01:03:11.781 --> 01:03:13.582
[SPEAKER_02]: They're totally... They're a little bit anal about their life.

01:03:13.602 --> 01:03:15.063
[SPEAKER_04]: However, they are now on iTunes.

01:03:15.143 --> 01:03:16.704
[SPEAKER_02]: They are the divas of rock.

01:03:17.605 --> 01:03:18.245
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

01:03:19.346 --> 01:03:19.646
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

01:03:22.248 --> 01:03:23.509
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, um...

01:03:24.116 --> 01:03:24.897
[SPEAKER_03]: Elton John, Rocketman

01:03:50.612 --> 01:03:55.376
[SPEAKER_03]: for all those who want to do a wonderful impression of William Shatner.

01:03:56.337 --> 01:04:01.381
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, Summertime, which I think is pretty cool.

01:04:02.462 --> 01:04:03.103
[SPEAKER_03]: Blur Song 2.

01:04:03.223 --> 01:04:04.484
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, Blur.

01:04:06.125 --> 01:04:07.286
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see here, some other good songs.

01:04:07.306 --> 01:04:10.209
[SPEAKER_04]: The resident Damon Auburn fangirl is going, whoo.

01:04:10.589 --> 01:04:12.171
[SPEAKER_03]: Scissor Sisters, Take Your Mama.

01:04:12.611 --> 01:04:13.692
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, Scissor Sisters.

01:04:14.973 --> 01:04:16.354
[SPEAKER_03]: The Police, Every Breath You Take.

01:04:16.574 --> 01:04:17.295
[SPEAKER_03]: Stalker Song.

01:04:18.212 --> 01:04:23.578
[SPEAKER_03]: Leonard Skinner, Sweet Home Alabama Good Charlotte, Girls and Boys Ace of Spades, Me and Some Guy

01:04:34.105 --> 01:04:35.746
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all giddy after freaking walking out to Motorhead at E3.

01:04:35.766 --> 01:04:37.968
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 15 minutes, I won't get back.

01:05:03.242 --> 01:05:04.463
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, DMN, shut up!

01:05:04.603 --> 01:05:05.584
[SPEAKER_04]: No, ooh, Alabama.

01:05:05.704 --> 01:05:06.705
[SPEAKER_04]: It's ooh, Alabama.

01:05:06.865 --> 01:05:07.946
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Alabama rocks.

01:05:08.427 --> 01:05:11.230
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to really ask those people at the IA Judgment booth.

01:05:11.890 --> 01:05:12.771
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell is this for?

01:05:12.811 --> 01:05:16.194
[SPEAKER_02]: You tried to, and they totally were ignoring you at one point.

01:05:16.215 --> 01:05:19.237
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you were totally like, what the hell is this thing?

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:22.481
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, good times.

01:05:22.561 --> 01:05:23.822
[SPEAKER_02]: Too bad there won't be an E3 next year.

01:05:24.401 --> 01:05:26.402
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, or, I'm sorry, in its current form.

01:05:26.642 --> 01:05:31.564
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, uh, chatroom's yelling and bitching, I need to make this correction, the MTV logo already appears on Guitar Hero 1.

01:05:32.245 --> 01:05:46.311
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I haven't, the last time I played Guitar Hero 1 was at E3, cause it was one of the games they had at Arena, and you know, it seems like every time you go into Arena, somebody's playing Guitar Hero, so, that's the last time I played it, and I didn't get to see the boot-up sequence at that time.

01:05:46.758 --> 01:05:51.762
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe the signs of this acquisition were a long time coming then, you could infer from that.

01:05:51.822 --> 01:05:53.543
[SPEAKER_02]: So sorry for my oversight.

01:05:53.583 --> 01:05:54.444
[SPEAKER_02]: You can flog me later.

01:05:54.524 --> 01:05:58.407
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure that the MTV logo being on the game is only going to make the game better.

01:06:01.610 --> 01:06:02.791
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, MTV!

01:06:03.031 --> 01:06:04.952
[SPEAKER_04]: Instantly my brain has turned to jello!

01:06:04.972 --> 01:06:06.814
[SPEAKER_03]: If anything, all it will do is help...

01:06:07.447 --> 01:06:08.388
[SPEAKER_03]: Help promote the game.

01:06:08.448 --> 01:06:09.349
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about it.

01:06:09.389 --> 01:06:16.796
[SPEAKER_03]: They will be able to promote it more on their shows and do their own Guitar Hero, be a Guitar Hero TV contest thing or whatever.

01:06:16.816 --> 01:06:17.116
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

01:06:17.496 --> 01:06:20.899
[SPEAKER_04]: Having the MTV logo on Guitar Hero makes it lose instant cool points.

01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:23.902
[SPEAKER_01]: Repeat what you said, Drew, not because you didn't have a mic.

01:06:24.122 --> 01:06:27.445
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, ooh, we might just be playing the Jackass theme on Guitar Hero.

01:06:27.585 --> 01:06:31.549
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, yeah, they'll combine some of their franchises here, you know, on

01:06:32.267 --> 01:06:32.847
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that show?

01:06:32.887 --> 01:06:37.528
[SPEAKER_02]: My Sweet Sixteen, Guitar Hero, whatever that fucking show is with the spoiled brats.

01:06:38.329 --> 01:06:39.609
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess he doesn't watch TV.

01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.749
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

01:06:41.069 --> 01:06:50.212
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't watch it very much either, but it's kind of one of those things when your roommate's watching Next, you can't help but kind of look and go, God damn, I weep for the youth of America.

01:06:51.012 --> 01:06:51.492
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay.

01:06:51.532 --> 01:06:52.012
[SPEAKER_01]: What's next?

01:06:52.032 --> 01:06:53.753
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we going to see Beavis and Butthead in the crowd?

01:06:54.898 --> 01:06:55.879
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be okay.

01:06:55.959 --> 01:06:56.679
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be cool.

01:06:56.759 --> 01:06:57.320
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be cool.

01:06:57.700 --> 01:06:58.700
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I like Beavis and Bowhead.

01:06:58.880 --> 01:06:59.821
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, that would be cool.

01:07:00.281 --> 01:07:03.563
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, like, have, like, some sort of, like, New Age thing.

01:07:03.623 --> 01:07:04.324
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not New Age.

01:07:04.344 --> 01:07:06.505
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, New Wave and then have, like, Daria hanging out on the side.

01:07:07.245 --> 01:07:08.146
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Nine Inch Nails concert.

01:07:08.466 --> 01:07:16.191
[SPEAKER_02]: Geeta in our chatroom says, This is the true story of seven gamers picked to play a game and have their lives taped.

01:07:18.172 --> 01:07:19.753
[SPEAKER_02]: Pull the gun trigger now.

01:07:20.073 --> 01:07:21.634
[SPEAKER_02]: Point it at my head and pull the trigger.

01:07:23.062 --> 01:07:24.482
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to other music game news.

01:07:24.502 --> 01:07:27.443
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a little bit exciting, but yet at the same time disappointing.

01:07:27.743 --> 01:07:32.404
[SPEAKER_02]: Word is coming via joystick from their hands-on of Parappa the Rapper on the PSP.

01:07:33.904 --> 01:07:45.727
[SPEAKER_02]: The PSP demo for Parappa the Rapper, which we reported last week is coming to the PSP, it's the exact same demo that the PS1 Parappa the Rapper used, which makes us think Parappa the Rapper on PSP is just going to be

01:07:46.258 --> 01:07:46.959
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in touch!

01:08:00.131 --> 01:08:02.253
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, there is some silver lining to this.

01:08:02.293 --> 01:08:03.634
[SPEAKER_02]: The graphics have been cleaned up.

01:08:03.934 --> 01:08:05.916
[SPEAKER_02]: The audio is a little bit crisper.

01:08:06.856 --> 01:08:11.020
[SPEAKER_02]: The rapping guy, you know, Parappa, of course, still stutters, you know, when you don't hit the buttons right.

01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:12.601
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that's kind of what they're supposed to do.

01:08:13.081 --> 01:08:19.366
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, supposedly, though, there is going to be a multiplayer mode, which could, you know, make this game the must-own.

01:08:19.527 --> 01:08:19.887
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

01:08:20.527 --> 01:08:24.250
[SPEAKER_02]: But it should also be pointed out that there's cute little Parappa stickers for the PSP.

01:08:24.330 --> 01:08:26.492
[SPEAKER_02]: And I look at that and I go, I want one right now.

01:08:27.093 --> 01:08:27.593
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now.

01:08:28.214 --> 01:08:28.754
[SPEAKER_02]: That's hot.

01:08:29.948 --> 01:08:51.916
[SPEAKER_02]: consumer whore and Hal alright we're going to bring this part A to a close here but first we've got DDR sneak peeks for you guys that's right here on Orange Lounge Radio we've been previewing new DDR games that are coming out very soon Ultramix 4 a little later this year as well as DDR Universe sometime this winter at some point

01:08:52.771 --> 01:08:53.672
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:11:39.474 --> 01:11:40.221
Thanks for watching!

01:12:14.226 --> 01:12:15.077
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

01:12:33.086 --> 01:12:39.048
[SPEAKER_02]: from DDR Ultra Mix 4, that is Rupesh Kartel with Yours to Command here on Orange Lounge Radio, the DDR Sneak Peeks.

01:12:40.068 --> 01:12:41.949
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of 80s reminiscent, that song.

01:12:41.969 --> 01:12:42.629
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of cool.

01:12:42.829 --> 01:12:44.750
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll probably have a pretty easy step chart, but that's okay.

01:12:44.770 --> 01:12:47.271
[SPEAKER_02]: The noobs need something to play, and that's a good song, I think.

01:12:47.791 --> 01:13:02.536
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're going to go into another song, and this song is from DDR Universe, and I have a feeling this might be a little bit of a controversial song because they've taken an old Konami classic and really remixed the heck out of it, so it's interesting.

01:13:03.076 --> 01:13:09.099
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine your favorite gothic whipping game of all time with a big band swing sound.

01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:11.800
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm not even kidding.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:17.363
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Castlevania the Freestyle and Mix, Wave Group featuring Mickey G. See what you think.

01:13:17.403 --> 01:13:20.945
[SPEAKER_02]: This is coming to DDR Universe here on the Orange Lounge Radio Sneak Peeks.

01:15:07.025 --> 01:15:11.266
[SPEAKER_02]: Castelvania, The Freestyle and Mix, Orange Lounge Radio, DDR, Sneak Peaks

01:15:27.017 --> 01:15:31.458
[SPEAKER_04]: You actually get either Vampire Killer or I think Bloodlines, depending on who you play.

01:15:31.858 --> 01:15:36.140
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Maria gets Vampire Killer, and it's sort of a similar mix to that.

01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:43.442
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, that style of music has shown up in Dracula X on the PC Engine Duo.

01:15:43.762 --> 01:15:48.564
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can't help but imagine Alucard in the shiny jacket getting down, you know, all BG style, right?

01:15:48.684 --> 01:15:49.064
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit?

01:15:50.144 --> 01:15:52.745
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, this is nothing new from Konami.

01:15:52.765 --> 01:15:53.105
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

01:15:53.305 --> 01:15:53.985
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:16:15.419 --> 01:16:16.960
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played that game in like a year.

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:21.862
[SPEAKER_02]: Chatroom is also yelling that we're not acknowledging Supernova that's coming out next week.

01:16:21.882 --> 01:16:25.183
[SPEAKER_02]: And should I point out, Loki actually already mentioned it, hello, in his upcoming releases.

01:16:26.064 --> 01:16:28.725
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, you guys already have heard the Supernova VR at this point.

01:16:28.745 --> 01:16:30.846
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have anything new for you regarding that.

01:16:31.286 --> 01:16:35.148
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do have something new for you from DDR Ultramix 4, another track here.

01:16:35.808 --> 01:16:39.390
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a song called Electric Air, and it's by an artist called Amit.

01:16:40.130 --> 01:16:42.491
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a simple four-letter name there, A-M-I-T, Amit.

01:16:43.056 --> 01:16:45.443
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's called Electric Air here on the DDR Sneak Previews.

01:16:45.483 --> 01:16:45.925
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out.

01:16:46.045 --> 01:16:46.547
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio.

01:18:24.346 --> 01:18:26.027
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:18:52.017 --> 01:18:52.999
[SPEAKER_02]: So is Toe Jam.

01:18:53.279 --> 01:18:54.441
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our last song tonight.

01:18:54.501 --> 01:18:58.867
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Big Idea with Return of the Toe Jam here on the Orange Lounge Radio.

01:18:59.168 --> 01:18:59.689
[SPEAKER_02]: Beep, beep.

01:20:42.990 --> 01:20:47.152
[SPEAKER_02]: Return of the Toe Jam by Big Idea, coming soon to DDR Universe.

01:20:47.252 --> 01:20:48.113
[SPEAKER_04]: That was cool.

01:20:48.493 --> 01:20:52.815
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I just, I expect Minnie Pearl to come out towards the end of that song and go, Hi!

01:20:54.336 --> 01:20:55.096
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's a great song.

01:20:55.116 --> 01:20:56.197
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Minnie Pearl!

01:20:57.717 --> 01:21:00.639
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's, you know, it's not, again, it's interesting.

01:21:00.679 --> 01:21:04.621
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of the songs we've played tonight kind of have this common theme where, like, you know,

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:08.961
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people probably really liked it, and some people didn't like it so much.

01:21:09.001 --> 01:21:13.762
[SPEAKER_02]: But hopefully there was one of those four, at least, if not three, that you really dug.

01:21:13.802 --> 01:21:15.423
[SPEAKER_02]: And me personally, I kind of dug them all.

01:21:15.563 --> 01:21:19.964
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not just saying that because of the... Trust me, if I thought one of them sucked, I'd tell you.

01:21:20.344 --> 01:21:23.525
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think they're all pretty cool, so the game should be interesting.

01:21:24.585 --> 01:21:30.727
[SPEAKER_04]: I have actually done square dancing when I was younger, much younger.

01:21:31.423 --> 01:21:32.404
[SPEAKER_02]: Square Dance Revolution

01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:01.001
[SPEAKER_02]: Konami, you listening?

01:22:01.061 --> 01:22:02.062
[SPEAKER_02]: Square Dance Revolution.

01:22:02.102 --> 01:22:02.623
[SPEAKER_02]: Make it happen.

01:22:02.703 --> 01:22:03.003
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.

01:22:04.345 --> 01:22:06.387
[SPEAKER_02]: They gave us Karaoke Revolution Country.

01:22:06.407 --> 01:22:08.169
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Karaoke Revolution Country sold, didn't it?

01:22:08.229 --> 01:22:11.193
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I played that at E3, though, so I could sing Good Old Boys.

01:22:12.053 --> 01:22:12.834
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, give me a break.

01:22:12.914 --> 01:22:15.257
[SPEAKER_04]: To get my Dukes of Hazzard on.

01:22:15.898 --> 01:22:20.303
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I played it at Konami Gamers Day, and there was some Shania song I sung in it.

01:22:20.839 --> 01:22:21.279
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.

01:22:21.399 --> 01:22:22.059
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember.

01:22:22.079 --> 01:22:22.479
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a while.

01:22:22.499 --> 01:22:23.140
[SPEAKER_04]: Shania is awesome.

01:22:24.100 --> 01:22:25.620
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I even know you two anymore?

01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:26.300
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently.

01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:27.801
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, line dancing revolution.

01:22:28.041 --> 01:22:28.981
[SPEAKER_04]: See, there's a difference.

01:22:29.021 --> 01:22:34.983
[SPEAKER_04]: Line dancing is kind of like stupid cheerleading para para, but score dancing is kind of cool.

01:22:37.623 --> 01:22:37.964
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

01:22:38.464 --> 01:22:41.064
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to go take a break so we can reminisce some more.

01:22:41.184 --> 01:22:47.326
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to do it for our part A, but we'll be back in a little bit with part B of our podcast.
