Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
There's a host, Dark Sakura, Sky, and the Lowkey

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, September 24th, 2006, PlayStation 3 reaction from the Tokyo Game Show

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Cold Shooter Classic is about to get a sequel

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
and the company that makes music game controllers sues someone over music game controllers

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
Welcome once again to Orange Lounge Radio

00:37.000 --> 00:43.000
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, and the gamer culture and lifestyle

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only, Dark Sakura, Miss Jamie Summers

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Roar

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
How you doing?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Roar

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Roar?

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Roar

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Or Zip

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Or A-R-J if you're old school

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Roar

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Roar

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
Also say hello to the one and only, Tech Master, Lowkey

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Hi

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
How you doing?

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
I'm frustrated

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Why?

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
Because certain things aren't working the way they should be

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
I see

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Don't you hate that?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
I do hate that

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
How things are described is very simple, yet never are

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Welcome to life, here's your manual

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
Also say hello to joining us tonight

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
Once again, we're going to have to ban you from the show pretty soon

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
You're here too much, no I'm kidding

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Say hello to Drunami

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
7-Zip is the wave of the future dammit

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Whatever

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
We're a little bit cooled off this week

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
We had a pretty exciting week last week obviously with our 200th episode

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
But we're back here for episode 201

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
Doing the same stuff we're used to doing every week

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
The show's back to be in just two parts, of course we release on the podcast stream every Monday

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
And about Wednesday is just when you can expect to see part B

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
Or if you want to hear the whole thing in bulk you can listen to us live when we record on orangelaundry.com

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
On Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
Or you can listen to our rebroadcast live of parts A and B that plays on all games radio

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
Over at allgames.com and that plays Monday nights at 5 o'clock Pacific

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Or I believe 9 AM on Tuesdays

02:16.000 --> 02:22.000
So if you're an early bird you can always catch that and you can hear all the show before it hits the podcast stream

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
Anyway we're going to start off as we always do talking about our gaming week

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
Or in DarkSakura's case perhaps her pinball week, I don't know

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
Yeah really actually all I played this week was Star Trek The Next Generation Pinball

02:35.000 --> 02:42.000
Which we finally have mostly working except for a couple of really crappy soldering jobs

02:42.000 --> 02:47.000
Whoever the previous owner was just like oh let's just put a bunch of goo here and solder it

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
And let's use hot glue to put this ramp back together and all this crap

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
Well Dan's been working on it, it's working just fine now

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
And other than that I ain't played crap because I've been like ugh

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
I've been sick all this past week

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Pinball's still a type of game, I mean it's still

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
Pinball is what we had before Pong

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
Pinball is the backbone of the gaming community

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
Well them's big words there but I would agree

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
Without pinball we would not have our arcades

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
In the gaming tree pinball is an essential branch

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Pinball is the root

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
I know I've said it before on this show, pinball was something I went to the arcades to play before DDR

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
Because I didn't play a whole lot in the arcades before that

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
Maybe your occasional Street Fighter 2, you know back when that was huge

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
When I was in junior high school using E. Honda's 100 hand slap

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
Look I was 100 hand slapping bitches long before Xbox Live

03:45.000 --> 03:51.000
I remember going back in the old days and playing Old Black Knight

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
Before it had a digital display

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
Playing the Time Machine one

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
Before we had digital displays, Pinbot

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
I was going to say Pinbot was the shit

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
Was Pinbot, I'll ask you this then we'll move on

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
Was Pinbot on the NES a great thing

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
Or a horrible mistransformation of the pinball experience

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Believe it or not I didn't have it

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
The first pinball game that I actually played on a home console

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
Was this like Gator game on the old school Gameboy

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Oh god, Revenge of the Gator

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Revenge of the Gator and Devil's Crush

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
On TurboGrafx

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Did you ever play Pinball Quest?

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
No

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Sonic Spinball however was my game

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Sonic Spinball was pretty awesome

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
Pinball Quest though is an interesting 8-bit title

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
It's one of those things like, it was a really good concept

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
But it was a little bit glitchy sometimes

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
I do have to agree with Act of Death, Terminator 2, pinball ruled

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
But we're actually trying to work on getting a Medivhial Madness

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
Well if you want to join our chatroom and make comments such as that last person just did

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
You can join our chatroom over at www.orangelandrater.com

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Click on chat

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
One thing I need to tell Jaded is that we have a Guns N' Roses now

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Oh yeah

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Yeah so we're in the Guns N' Roses Pinball Owners Club

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
How many pinball tables do you have now? You've got to have at least six

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Seven

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Oh my gosh

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
We've got Last Action Hero

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Whodunnit

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Twilight Zone, I love Twilight Zone

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
We have Johnny Mnemonic which sucks but Dan likes it

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
We've got Judge Dredd which actually now belongs to a friend of ours

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Because we traded with him to get the Guns N' Roses

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
So we have Guns N' Roses and we have Star Trek The Next Generation

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
You're gonna open up an arcade in your garage pretty soon

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
Actually Dan's busy rearranging our entire house

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
Trying to get four pinball machines in and two maim cabinets

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
And yet I still have not come over and played all these pinball machines

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
I think I need two

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
He's building me a maim cabinet out of a Tekken 3 so I'm fairly happy

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
That's pretty hot

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Alright well we'll move on

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
Loki how was your gaming week? Did you play any pinball?

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
No I did not

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
That's too bad

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Well what did you play?

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
Well I played Saints Row and did a little bit more than that, that was pretty fun

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
And a little bit of Bomberman just because I have it

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
And Cookie Mama, I bought that for Nellie and she hated it

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
And so I've been playing it

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
I'm glad you tried to buy the wife a cooking game to teach her a thing or two

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
You know what

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
We try but it doesn't work you know

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
I'll buy it off you if you don't like it

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
No it's alright

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
So you must like it then

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
I play it just because I have it because you know

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
I've gotten rid of most of my other DS games

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
Okay explain to us you know because there's probably a lot of people who've seen this game on the shelves

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
You know it's Cookie Mama and it's gone, what the F is that?

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
It's basically a bunch of mini games that you play through

06:33.000 --> 06:38.000
Depending on how you complete them you get a score at the end

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
And basically they have different mini games depending on what dish you're creating

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
So for example rice you know you'll have the first mini game will be measure out of the rice

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
And you have to measure it to a line and you have to do it with a time limit

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
And then they have another one that's a Japanese import game right

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Yeah

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Okay just

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
So rice is the first stage

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Rice is the first stage

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
And then you have to measure out the water

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
It's your joke here sorry

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
And then you have you know the stage where you have to wash the rice

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
And then you have the stage where you have to cook the rice

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
They're all just like basically rhythm and you know

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Just kind of like cutting and tapping and stuff like that

07:16.000 --> 07:19.280
Now, see, wouldn't this game be more fun, though, if there was rapping in the background,

07:19.280 --> 07:20.280
you know?

07:20.280 --> 07:21.280
Possibly.

07:21.280 --> 07:26.800
Now, wash the rice, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, like, or what was the, uh, I'm the cooking

07:26.800 --> 07:27.800
chicken.

07:27.800 --> 07:31.400
Well, here's, the problem, the problem with the game is the sensitivity is really, like,

07:31.400 --> 07:37.080
off on a lot of the games, so, you know, you're really gonna get frustrated with stuff, you

07:37.080 --> 07:38.480
know, and, I don't know.

07:38.480 --> 07:41.280
And then there's also some levels, they don't really give you a good description of what

07:41.280 --> 07:44.760
you're supposed to do, so it's kinda hard and you get frustrated real easy, which is

07:44.760 --> 07:47.000
why Nellie stopped playing, because she couldn't figure out what the hell she was supposed

07:47.000 --> 07:50.880
to do in certain levels, because it doesn't really explain it to you, they give you the

07:50.880 --> 07:55.720
option to practice it, but they don't really kind of take you through a tutorial to tell

07:55.720 --> 08:00.200
you how to cook, they're just like, do it!

08:00.200 --> 08:04.960
Because Japanese are smarter, so, that's just, you know, that way that is.

08:04.960 --> 08:11.840
Um, then of course, you know, Grand Theft Auto, because that's fun, um, Zuma, I've been

08:11.840 --> 08:14.280
playing a lot of Xbox Live Arcade stuff.

08:14.280 --> 08:21.440
I played Fusion Frenzy 2, which is part of that, you know, Tokyo Game Show demo thingy

08:21.440 --> 08:26.880
on the live, and Fusion Frenzy 2 sucks balls, and I will not be buying that game.

08:26.880 --> 08:27.880
Why?

08:27.880 --> 08:28.880
It looked interesting to the trailer.

08:28.880 --> 08:30.640
It was extremely lame.

08:30.640 --> 08:31.640
Extremely lame.

08:31.640 --> 08:32.640
What was lame about it?

08:32.640 --> 08:36.580
Well, the games themselves are just dumb, like, there's one level, it's like, we're

08:36.580 --> 08:41.220
trying to be Mario Party, but we're not even coming near Mario Party, it's just all these

08:41.220 --> 08:46.480
mini games that have, there's like no point to them, and they're just dumb.

08:46.480 --> 08:51.400
Well, is it maybe just because it's a demo, and maybe it's just not, all the other mini

08:51.400 --> 08:54.720
games, you know, are just kind of variations of these mini games.

08:54.720 --> 08:58.960
It's just like, you know, there's one of them that you're kind of these gladiator, you know,

08:58.960 --> 09:02.960
American Gladiator type ball things, and you're rolling around, and you basically, okay, who

09:02.960 --> 09:06.040
can cover the most space with their color?

09:06.040 --> 09:07.920
And okay, that's kind of lame.

09:07.920 --> 09:12.060
And then there is another one where you have to pick up boxes and put them in your corner,

09:12.060 --> 09:14.120
and you can steal boxes from other players.

09:14.120 --> 09:18.680
It screams Mario Kart, or not Mario Kart, Mario Party, but without any of the actual

09:18.680 --> 09:22.360
board stuff, and it's just a very lame generic game.

09:22.360 --> 09:28.880
So, and surprising enough, it's also by Hudson, which made the wonderful smash hit game, Bomberman

09:28.880 --> 09:29.880
Act Zero.

09:29.880 --> 09:30.880
So are we surprised?

09:30.880 --> 09:33.160
Okay, but at the same time, they also made Mario Party.

09:33.160 --> 09:34.160
Excellent.

09:34.160 --> 09:38.160
And you know what, they've really sucked it up on the 360 so far, so whatever.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.320
Did you ever play the first one?

09:40.320 --> 09:41.320
No, I didn't.

09:41.320 --> 09:44.600
Because there's an interesting comment in our chat room here, Mystic Gohan says, Fusion

09:44.600 --> 09:47.000
Frenzy 2 sucked, but number one owned.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.760
Well, maybe this is going to be better in a full game, but I'm not buying it, so whatever.

09:51.760 --> 09:57.360
I also played the new Tenchu game, which was only available in Japan, and it's pretty cool.

09:57.360 --> 10:00.720
You know, I wasn't really into Tenchu, but I like running around, jumping on buildings

10:00.720 --> 10:04.960
and stuff, and throwing ninja stars into people's heads, so that's kind of cool.

10:04.960 --> 10:05.960
No, that sounds fun.

10:05.960 --> 10:06.960
Yeah, so that's fun.

10:06.960 --> 10:11.120
The only problem about that game, because it wasn't Japanese, I had trouble figuring

10:11.120 --> 10:15.960
out the controls, because it is kind of difficult to figure out what you've got to do.

10:15.960 --> 10:17.960
So once I figured it out, it's pretty fun.

10:17.960 --> 10:22.600
But supposedly they're putting up a Sonic the Hedgehog demo later, so that'd be pretty

10:22.600 --> 10:23.600
cool to check out.

10:23.600 --> 10:28.120
And I don't know if you want me to talk about it now, but I got this wonderful device, sure

10:28.120 --> 10:29.120
go for it.

10:29.120 --> 10:33.880
On the Xbox Live Vision camera, I have to say that this thing sucks.

10:33.880 --> 10:34.880
Really?

10:34.880 --> 10:35.880
Yeah.

10:35.880 --> 10:37.280
Because I've heard a lot of positive reviews elsewhere.

10:37.280 --> 10:39.480
Okay, the camera is blurry as fuck.

10:39.480 --> 10:41.480
Blurry, blurry, blurry.

10:41.480 --> 10:42.920
Did you just do something to it?

10:42.920 --> 10:43.920
No.

10:43.920 --> 10:44.920
Did you leave the sticker on?

10:44.920 --> 10:46.160
No, there is no sticker on this thing.

10:46.160 --> 10:48.200
I don't think there is a sticker on this thing.

10:48.200 --> 10:50.320
No, there is no sticker on this thing.

10:50.320 --> 10:54.680
It would have been hella funny if there was, and he's like, son of a bitch!

10:54.680 --> 10:55.680
No.

10:55.680 --> 10:57.160
Okay, so it's very blurry.

10:57.160 --> 10:58.440
Very, very blurry.

10:58.440 --> 11:01.960
That's because it knew what you and Nelly were going to be doing with it, so it had

11:01.960 --> 11:03.160
to blur out the naughty bits.

11:03.160 --> 11:08.640
Okay, I just wanted to take a picture of my face to put it on the Xbox Live, and no matter

11:08.640 --> 11:11.640
what kind of lighting I have in the room, it's always blurry.

11:11.640 --> 11:13.400
Very, very blurry.

11:13.400 --> 11:17.800
And no matter what I do to adjust the focus on it, always blurry.

11:17.800 --> 11:21.920
And then the other thing on this as well, I'm trying to hook it up to my PC.

11:21.920 --> 11:25.280
Apparently it's supposed to be as easy as, plug in PC work.

11:25.280 --> 11:26.280
No.

11:26.280 --> 11:27.640
Of course it's never going to be like that.

11:27.640 --> 11:32.280
So I got the updated drivers for it, and it's funny because the old drivers work kinda crappy,

11:32.280 --> 11:33.280
but they work.

11:33.280 --> 11:34.960
The new drivers don't work at all.

11:34.960 --> 11:38.360
So this thing is just, it's doing nothing.

11:38.360 --> 11:41.480
I was going to have a webcam for you guys, folks, and we were going to have the wonderful

11:41.480 --> 11:45.720
webcam, but you can thank Microsoft for putting out a really shoddy camera.

11:45.720 --> 11:47.400
What would happen if I plugged that in my Mac?

11:47.400 --> 11:48.800
You think it would work right away?

11:48.800 --> 11:51.200
No, it'll just go.

11:51.200 --> 11:53.960
I'm going to try it during the break.

11:53.960 --> 11:54.960
You know I gotta try.

11:54.960 --> 11:56.520
Well, here's the thing.

11:56.520 --> 11:57.520
Just for you.

11:57.520 --> 11:58.520
That's the thing, though.

11:58.520 --> 12:00.720
Like I said, the generic drivers worked on it.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.440
The new drivers do not.

12:02.440 --> 12:06.240
So go right ahead and try that, but you know what?

12:06.240 --> 12:07.240
The new drivers don't.

12:07.240 --> 12:08.240
So, whatever.

12:08.240 --> 12:17.120
Now, the cool thing, you tried to video chat with me, and it was pretty blurry, but what's

12:17.120 --> 12:22.160
interesting is that another podcaster, our old buddy Bobby, sent a picture of his kitty

12:22.160 --> 12:27.440
cat, because you can send pictures on Xbox Live instead of messages if you want, and

12:27.440 --> 12:29.520
I got a picture of his kitty cat, and it was pretty clear.

12:29.520 --> 12:33.240
It was a little dark, like there were some contrast issues, but he probably just didn't

12:33.240 --> 12:35.360
have the right lighting behind it.

12:35.360 --> 12:39.040
Most of our houses aren't set up to have lighting behind where our systems are at.

12:39.040 --> 12:41.600
At least in this house, I know the lighting is by the couch.

12:41.600 --> 12:46.920
That's probably why he has the contrast issues, but it was sharp, unlike when we video chatted.

12:46.920 --> 12:47.920
Well, here's the thing.

12:47.920 --> 12:52.880
The video chat's only in 640 by 480, whereas the pictures are 1.3 megapixels, so that's

12:52.880 --> 12:53.880
the difference.

12:53.880 --> 12:59.040
So, yeah, it looks all blurry, but then when you take a picture, it's just, you know, supposed

12:59.040 --> 13:00.040
to be clear.

13:00.040 --> 13:04.520
Except for your gamer tag pictures, those are still blurry as hell, because I took one

13:04.520 --> 13:07.280
and I'm like, wow, I can't see anything in it.

13:07.280 --> 13:11.680
Then how come some of the other, like I have three other podcasters on my list who got

13:11.680 --> 13:16.880
the camera early, because Microsoft likes them, and they all look fine.

13:16.880 --> 13:21.520
I don't get it, but here's the thing, I say take it back.

13:21.520 --> 13:22.520
It's not my face.

13:22.520 --> 13:23.520
I'm not blurry.

13:23.520 --> 13:28.120
I think that's what SSJ100Matt in chat says, maybe it's your face, Loki.

13:28.120 --> 13:30.280
Yeah, and here's the other thing.

13:30.280 --> 13:32.880
Thank you, Microsoft.

13:32.880 --> 13:41.080
This camera is made for cyber sex, and I showed Rob why this camera is made for cyber sex.

13:41.080 --> 13:42.240
It's very disturbing.

13:42.240 --> 13:43.240
For some reason...

13:43.240 --> 13:44.720
And I never want to see it again.

13:44.720 --> 13:52.880
Okay, for some reason, a feature that was added into the video chat on live, and explain

13:52.880 --> 13:55.800
to me why you would need this.

13:55.800 --> 14:01.680
If you push the trigger buttons on your controller, it makes the other person's controller vibrate,

14:01.680 --> 14:04.040
as long as you hold them down.

14:04.040 --> 14:10.360
If that does not screen cyber sex, I don't know what does.

14:10.360 --> 14:11.360
Thank you, Microsoft.

14:11.360 --> 14:13.600
You guys really thought of everything.

14:13.600 --> 14:19.760
You vision camera, would I recommend buying it?

14:19.760 --> 14:20.760
I don't know.

14:20.760 --> 14:27.080
I mean, maybe the room I'm using, because I got the camera to look decent, it was just

14:27.080 --> 14:32.800
very blurry still, but compared to the last digital camera that we had, the webcam, I

14:32.800 --> 14:33.800
guess it's okay.

14:33.800 --> 14:38.240
I can't just get this thing to work anymore.

14:38.240 --> 14:41.200
We'll try it on my Xbox when we're done, see if maybe the different lighting in this house

14:41.200 --> 14:42.200
will help.

14:42.200 --> 14:43.200
Maybe.

14:43.200 --> 14:44.200
I don't know.

14:44.200 --> 14:46.160
It's worth picking up if you can find one.

14:46.160 --> 14:51.800
I know GameStop, at least where I got mine pre-ordered at, they didn't get any extras

14:51.800 --> 14:54.920
in, so it might be pretty hard to find.

14:54.920 --> 14:57.480
I'm not getting one.

14:57.480 --> 14:59.600
You know what, you're not interested in the vision thing?

14:59.600 --> 15:00.600
No.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.800
You don't want the whole vibration with the controller thing?

15:02.800 --> 15:03.800
No.

15:03.800 --> 15:06.480
It was kind of funny when he did it, because it was like, what the hell, why is the controller

15:06.480 --> 15:07.480
shaking?

15:07.480 --> 15:08.480
And Loogie's like, do you feel that?

15:08.480 --> 15:09.480
Do you feel that?

15:09.480 --> 15:16.000
I have a PC, and I actually have a real webcam, which nobody is giving the address to since

15:16.000 --> 15:17.320
I don't upload it to anywhere.

15:17.320 --> 15:22.480
But you can't play Uno with the webcam on the PC, at least I don't know any versions

15:22.480 --> 15:23.480
of it yet.

15:23.480 --> 15:26.400
I don't touch our Xbox 360.

15:26.400 --> 15:27.400
What about Dead Rising?

15:27.400 --> 15:31.640
Okay, I played that, but that was the last thing I played, because it was all about zombie

15:31.640 --> 15:32.640
killing.

15:32.640 --> 15:36.640
I've been sort of not playing the 360.

15:36.640 --> 15:39.520
No interest in Totem Ball or anything?

15:39.520 --> 15:40.520
Pinball.

15:40.520 --> 15:41.520
I don't know.

15:41.520 --> 15:44.040
I kind of want one, but it can also kind of wait.

15:44.040 --> 15:48.200
I mean, it's not something, I think I support many games for it right now, so yeah, I thought

15:48.200 --> 15:51.880
I would want it right away, and I was kind of looking for one, but now I'm like, eh,

15:51.880 --> 15:53.280
do I really need to video chat?

15:53.280 --> 15:54.400
I don't know.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.320
It can wait, especially after seeing Loogie's.

15:56.320 --> 15:57.320
We'll see.

15:57.320 --> 15:59.800
Let's see, My Gaming Week.

15:59.800 --> 16:01.620
Actually not a lot of new stuff.

16:01.620 --> 16:03.560
There really wasn't anything new I picked up this week.

16:03.560 --> 16:08.200
I was interested in getting the camera at one point, but I wasn't able to get it, because

16:08.200 --> 16:11.640
I didn't pre-order one, because I didn't think I would want it, but then I was going to go

16:11.640 --> 16:13.460
look for it, and they didn't have it.

16:13.460 --> 16:17.520
So I've pretty much just been watching a friend of mine play through Enchanted Arms, because

16:17.520 --> 16:21.200
I showed it to a friend of mine, and he's been in love with it, and just over here playing

16:21.200 --> 16:27.480
it a lot, so he got further and I did, so I think he's about, I think the percentage

16:27.480 --> 16:32.560
said he was like 46% of the way through the game, so some of the voice acting gets a little

16:32.560 --> 16:34.120
better when you get to midway.

16:34.120 --> 16:37.160
Some of the voice actors are pretty good, and some are still pretty bad, but the game's

16:37.160 --> 16:38.880
plot got interesting.

16:38.880 --> 16:40.140
It's pretty fun.

16:40.140 --> 16:43.720
I think if you're a role-playing fan and you happen to have a 360, you should definitely

16:43.720 --> 16:46.720
check out Enchanted Arms, because there's really not a lot else for you right now on

16:46.720 --> 16:49.380
the 360, and Enchanted Arms is decent.

16:49.380 --> 16:52.800
It's not a, hey, we made this at the last minute so we could say we have an RPG on the

16:52.800 --> 16:53.800
system.

16:53.800 --> 16:54.800
It's pretty good.

16:54.800 --> 16:55.800
I was pretty happy.

16:55.800 --> 16:58.920
Drew Nami, how was your gaming week?

16:58.920 --> 17:01.600
Oddly enough, I've been playing a lot of Rez.

17:01.600 --> 17:02.600
Really?

17:02.600 --> 17:04.400
Really, really.

17:04.400 --> 17:07.240
Aside from that, I haven't been really playing that many games.

17:07.240 --> 17:12.320
They took a break from WoW and, oh yeah, I've been playing World of Warcraft a lot, actually.

17:12.320 --> 17:19.400
I'm in a new guild, so my friend convinced me to join the gay guild on Proudmoore, so

17:19.400 --> 17:21.680
I've been playing there a lot.

17:21.680 --> 17:22.680
It's fun.

17:22.680 --> 17:23.680
Yeah, I took a break.

17:23.680 --> 17:25.320
I'm a little bit burned out.

17:25.320 --> 17:29.240
Aside from that, I've been playing a little bit of Xenosaga, episode one, trying to finish

17:29.240 --> 17:31.160
it so I can move on.

17:31.160 --> 17:33.240
I borrowed Dirge of Cerberus from a friend.

17:33.240 --> 17:38.440
It's actually not too bad, even though console first-person shooters are kind of just a sacrilege

17:38.440 --> 17:41.160
to me.

17:41.160 --> 17:46.440
Aside from that, I'm trying to get through Kingdom Hearts II on Proudmoore, and I realized

17:46.440 --> 17:49.840
how much I truly suck at that game.

17:49.840 --> 17:52.420
Aside from that, not much.

17:52.420 --> 17:55.160
What would you say to the people that say Kingdom Hearts II is nothing but a bunch of

17:55.160 --> 17:56.580
button mashing?

17:56.580 --> 18:00.480
You haven't played it on Proudmoore, and you haven't gotten to Beast's Castle round two.

18:00.480 --> 18:05.680
As you said, I read some reviews that said- There's even regular mode, the Demyx battle.

18:05.680 --> 18:08.040
Yeah, Demyx is just a pain in the ass.

18:08.040 --> 18:10.040
He's just a bitch.

18:10.040 --> 18:13.400
Alright, well, let's go on to some housekeeping, and then we're going to-

18:13.400 --> 18:15.920
Oh, I wanted to mention one thing that I thought was pretty cool.

18:15.920 --> 18:19.160
GameStop, when I went and picked up my camera, I just looked around a little bit to see if

18:19.160 --> 18:20.600
there's anything else I wanted.

18:20.600 --> 18:27.440
I found a BeatMania 2DX turntable controller for $8.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.440
Picked that sucker up.

18:28.440 --> 18:32.080
Now, it's mine, because at least I'm babysitting it for a little while, because Loki hates

18:32.080 --> 18:33.080
BeatMania.

18:33.080 --> 18:35.720
Well, I just don't have any games.

18:35.720 --> 18:39.160
At the time, I didn't have my PlayStation 2 back, but I finally got it back.

18:39.160 --> 18:40.160
Do you have US BeatMania?

18:40.160 --> 18:41.160
No.

18:41.160 --> 18:42.160
You can borrow that?

18:42.160 --> 18:45.680
If you want, you can borrow my- So, you can borrow my Japanese PlayStation, and the various

18:45.680 --> 18:46.680
styles I own.

18:46.680 --> 18:47.680
I don't own them all.

18:47.680 --> 18:48.680
No, I've got my HD loader.

18:48.680 --> 18:49.680
I'll just load the Japanese.

18:49.680 --> 18:50.680
Oh, well.

18:50.680 --> 18:53.840
I'll put the new 2DX that they have in Japan over there on it.

18:53.840 --> 18:54.840
Alright, well.

18:54.840 --> 18:58.240
Excuse me for trying to do something- I'll just leave the controller here, because

18:58.240 --> 18:59.440
I don't want to play 2DX.

18:59.440 --> 19:00.440
I couldn't pass that up.

19:00.440 --> 19:01.440
I'm going to play doubles.

19:01.440 --> 19:04.680
I'm going to get back into 2DX and play doubles, because doubles keyboard mania was a blast,

19:04.680 --> 19:07.680
and when you could play that in the arcade, people were like, WTF!

19:07.680 --> 19:09.240
So many buttons!

19:09.240 --> 19:16.800
Dude, no, watching someone do, like, a seven-star- Yeah, I was never as good- I mean, I could

19:16.800 --> 19:19.080
get through a couple doubles songs, you know.

19:19.080 --> 19:22.680
I was pretty decent- I could do three stars, that was it, and doubles.

19:22.680 --> 19:25.400
Who was that guy that is so good at keyboard mania?

19:25.400 --> 19:26.400
Blue?

19:26.400 --> 19:27.400
Is that his name?

19:27.400 --> 19:28.400
Blue Guy?

19:28.400 --> 19:29.400
Whoa!

19:29.400 --> 19:33.240
He can smoke those doubles, like, you know, that are, like, the maximum level, and I'll

19:33.240 --> 19:36.280
tell you what- I loved watching him play keyboard mania, though.

19:36.280 --> 19:42.120
That gives me a gamer boner so much more than the 2DX and Papa Music videos.

19:42.120 --> 19:43.440
He also plays piano very well.

19:43.440 --> 19:45.560
Yeah, because I like the piano music a lot more.

19:45.560 --> 19:48.600
I mean, I'm not disrespecting the 2DX, you know, because there's a lot of impressive

19:48.600 --> 19:52.320
stuff there, but watching the keyboard mania was, whew, very impressive.

19:52.320 --> 19:54.520
You should also see him do doubles on Pump It Up.

19:54.520 --> 19:55.520
Alright.

19:55.520 --> 19:56.520
Someday, someday.

19:56.520 --> 19:57.520
Alright.

19:57.520 --> 19:58.520
Housekeeping!

19:58.520 --> 20:01.520
First, we want to thank everybody for all the well wishes for episode 200, because we

20:01.520 --> 20:04.560
continued to kind of get them throughout the week, even after the show.

20:04.560 --> 20:08.280
I got a couple messages on Xbox Live, which was very nice, and I know we got some emails

20:08.280 --> 20:11.880
and some message board posts, so we just wanted to say thank you guys, and it was a fun show,

20:11.880 --> 20:16.720
it was a long show, but it was a fun show, and really glad you guys that were able to

20:16.720 --> 20:20.960
join us live did, or if you couldn't join us live, we're glad you got through all three

20:20.960 --> 20:23.760
parts, so thank you.

20:23.760 --> 20:27.280
Also want to say the DDR sneak peeks are continuing tonight.

20:27.280 --> 20:28.280
Those haven't stopped.

20:28.280 --> 20:32.440
They'll be a little later on in this program, four new tracks, two from Ultramix 4 and two

20:32.440 --> 20:40.160
from Universe, and also I want to say about this podcast is we are now a default podcast

20:40.160 --> 20:45.900
on a little handy program called XB Stream, and if you haven't checked out this program,

20:45.900 --> 20:49.120
it's pretty neat.

20:49.120 --> 20:52.080
I'm so surprised that something like this came out of Homebrew.

20:52.080 --> 20:54.320
I'm saying that in a positive way.

20:54.320 --> 20:58.300
It pretty much seems like one person really put in all this effort into this program and

20:58.300 --> 21:03.100
just really did something that Microsoft should have done themselves.

21:03.100 --> 21:06.080
It's kind of impressive that this one guy did this, but basically what he's done is

21:06.080 --> 21:11.040
he set up a program that not only catches podcasts and automatically shares them over

21:11.040 --> 21:16.380
the network to your Xbox 360, it doesn't put them on the hard drive if the Xbox 360 uses

21:16.380 --> 21:20.780
the network, but what it also does is it downloads RSS feeds.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.840
Let's say you want to read Kotaku.

21:22.840 --> 21:27.840
Let's say you have Kotaku in your feed, and what it does is it translates the text of

21:27.840 --> 21:32.400
the RSS feed and makes it an image, and then so if you go through your photo gallery on

21:32.400 --> 21:36.500
Xbox 360, you can read RSS feeds, and you might be thinking, well, when in the hell

21:36.500 --> 21:37.500
would this be useful?

21:37.500 --> 21:41.320
Well, if somebody else is using the computer and you're using the Xbox 360, you could still

21:41.320 --> 21:46.440
read those live blogging things going on, so it's a really neat idea, so I think that's

21:46.440 --> 21:51.080
great and we're really happy to be included as one of the podcasts that you'll get when

21:51.080 --> 21:55.420
you download this program now, so if you want to check it out, it's over at xbstream.com.

21:55.420 --> 21:59.640
This is the same program that caused a little bit of controversy when it first came out

21:59.640 --> 22:05.960
because I imagine the program was originally designed with RSS feeds in mind, so what it

22:05.960 --> 22:10.800
was doing is that it was refreshing the RSS feeds every 15 minutes and grabbing the last

22:10.800 --> 22:11.800
30 items.

22:11.800 --> 22:16.400
Well, the unfortunate thing is is that when they decided to enable the podcast stuff as

22:16.400 --> 22:21.960
well, they kept the same settings, so folks that were in the initial release of the program

22:21.960 --> 22:26.580
as the default podcast, like I know GamerAndy was one of them, among many others, like his

22:26.580 --> 22:30.280
site got hammered because you had all these people that were trying out the software because

22:30.280 --> 22:36.200
Major Nelson had posted about it, downloading 30 episodes of his show at a time and re-hammering

22:36.200 --> 22:37.200
his feed.

22:37.200 --> 22:41.080
It was almost like getting a denial of service attack, so it was like one of those, oh, crap,

22:41.080 --> 22:44.560
someone made a really big mistake, but I know they all worked it out and the author of the

22:44.560 --> 22:48.120
program was very like, oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, and they've worked

22:48.120 --> 22:53.120
it out now, so it only, I think, hits it once in a while and it only downloads one podcast

22:53.120 --> 22:59.440
by default, so that's pretty exciting because when I told the webmaster, our old friend

22:59.440 --> 23:03.040
VxJ6V that we were going to be on there, he's like, wait a minute, I was reading that this

23:03.040 --> 23:04.040
might not be a good thing.

23:04.040 --> 23:07.800
I'm like, no, no, no, they fixed it, they fixed it, we're cool, so anyway, check it

23:07.800 --> 23:12.780
out if you guys have an Xbox 360 and a network that it's connected to.

23:12.780 --> 23:15.080
Now we shall go into some news.

23:15.080 --> 23:16.080
Shall we, Jamie?

23:16.080 --> 23:18.080
Sure, why don't we?

23:18.080 --> 23:22.440
Well, you know, I always shake my head because, you know what I call him?

23:22.440 --> 23:25.400
I call him Ken Crayon Eater.

23:25.400 --> 23:34.360
So apparently the price of the PlayStation 3 in Japan has been dropped.

23:34.360 --> 23:40.460
Even though they're still having the delays with their production, they're stating that

23:40.460 --> 23:48.720
they are going to reprice the 20 gigabyte model with an inclusion of the HDMI port for

23:48.720 --> 23:59.400
49,980 yen, which is roughly 48 bucks in the US, about 225 pounds in the UK, which is actually

23:59.400 --> 24:02.280
a reduction from 62,790 yen.

24:02.280 --> 24:08.240
So that's a pretty significant drop, at least, you know, a couple hundred.

24:08.240 --> 24:15.080
So they're also saying that at the Tokyo Game Show there were going to be 200 playable consoles.

24:15.080 --> 24:19.200
What I haven't found out is if they are actually still those rack mounted servers.

24:19.200 --> 24:20.600
Yes, they are.

24:20.600 --> 24:23.120
See, I'm not surprised.

24:23.120 --> 24:27.560
Now one thing that was mentioned, and I found out, you know, after reading the article a

24:27.560 --> 24:31.080
bit of a rebuttal on this, is that they're saying that the online service was going to

24:31.080 --> 24:35.480
offer Mega Drive and PC Engine titles, but Sega had something different to say about

24:35.480 --> 24:36.880
that, didn't they?

24:36.880 --> 24:37.880
Yes.

24:37.880 --> 24:41.720
They said that it was something that they were considering based on, you know, the architecture

24:41.720 --> 24:47.480
of the online system, but it wasn't something that they were doing right away.

24:47.480 --> 24:49.960
More proof that Ken Kudaragi eats crayons.

24:49.960 --> 24:54.120
However, one thing I do think is kind of cool is their global mapping system so that you

24:54.120 --> 24:59.320
can, basically what it does is you upload your pictures, data about where you live,

24:59.320 --> 25:02.800
and it makes a world map where various PS3 gamers live.

25:02.800 --> 25:05.840
It's kind of neat, but...

25:05.840 --> 25:07.640
So it's like that one site.

25:07.640 --> 25:08.640
What is that site?

25:08.640 --> 25:09.640
Frapper.

25:09.640 --> 25:10.640
Thank you.

25:10.640 --> 25:11.640
Frapper.

25:11.640 --> 25:14.480
It's like a frapper, because we have an Orange Launch Radio Frapper, and you should join

25:14.480 --> 25:17.540
that if you haven't already, but yeah, it sounds like Frapper for your PS3.

25:17.540 --> 25:19.040
I'm getting that impression.

25:19.040 --> 25:20.040
Huh.

25:20.040 --> 25:23.840
But I still think that, you know, he needs to keep the bicycle helmet on a little bit

25:23.840 --> 25:24.840
longer.

25:24.840 --> 25:28.320
His head hasn't quite healed from that last falling.

25:28.320 --> 25:30.440
He's still got the baby soft spot.

25:30.440 --> 25:31.440
Yeah.

25:31.440 --> 25:33.720
His skull hasn't completely molded together.

25:33.720 --> 25:36.680
You guys are crazy.

25:36.680 --> 25:40.520
It's interesting because I'm reading about the XB Stream stuff in chat, because apparently,

25:40.520 --> 25:43.740
you know, some of the other podcasters who were affected by that whole thing were very

25:43.740 --> 25:46.520
vocal about it, and some of our, you know, folks listen to other podcasts.

25:46.520 --> 25:50.660
I do try to listen to other podcasts, but ever since my iPod broke last week, it's been

25:50.660 --> 25:54.440
very hard for me to listen to other podcasts, so I'm kind of behind on all the gossip on

25:54.440 --> 25:56.360
XB Stream.

25:56.360 --> 26:01.560
But they're saying, let's see, they said here something about gamer Andy loves XB Stream.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.480
I think there's a hint of sarcasm there.

26:03.480 --> 26:06.200
Funny Dale says, XB Stream nearly shut down IGN.

26:06.200 --> 26:07.200
I'm not kidding.

26:07.200 --> 26:10.480
And then Funny Dale goes on to say, wait, shut down IGN.

26:10.480 --> 26:14.460
On second thought, I love XB Stream.

26:14.460 --> 26:18.560
But Black Wolf says, reminds us that Tiger Claw, or was saying to Tiger Claw, I guess

26:18.560 --> 26:22.080
in a message here, he offered to compensate for the bandwidth bills.

26:22.080 --> 26:26.320
The author was like, so, you know, oops, I really made a big, big mistake.

26:26.320 --> 26:27.320
I'll pay for the bills.

26:27.320 --> 26:30.600
I thought that was kind of nice, you know, so.

26:30.600 --> 26:36.560
Anyway, moving on, I wanted to say really quickly regarding the PlayStation 3.

26:36.560 --> 26:40.120
There's an interesting series that Kotaku's been running, because they have some folks

26:40.120 --> 26:44.320
over at the show, and they've been posting these videos on YouTubes asking people, do

26:44.320 --> 26:47.600
you want to get the Wii or the PlayStation 3?

26:47.600 --> 26:50.240
Not sure why they didn't include the Xbox 360, but whatever.

26:50.240 --> 26:55.460
I guess maybe they figured that, you know, Xbox 360 is not really the console of choice

26:55.460 --> 26:56.460
in Japan right now.

26:56.460 --> 26:57.460
Although, I don't know.

26:57.460 --> 27:00.800
I figured they had long waits to see Blue Dragon, but anyway.

27:00.800 --> 27:05.120
They're going Wii or PlayStation 3, and they did this little poll here, and it turns out

27:05.120 --> 27:09.600
PlayStation 3 was getting about two to one of the vote.

27:09.600 --> 27:12.680
So for every one person that said they wanted a Wii had two people that said they wanted

27:12.680 --> 27:14.280
a PlayStation 3.

27:14.280 --> 27:19.580
Now if you poll your average American, or heck, even European message board, I'm not

27:19.580 --> 27:21.880
seeing that same correlation.

27:21.880 --> 27:26.620
So what is it about Japan and their love for the PlayStation 3?

27:26.620 --> 27:29.360
Is it the fact that Nintendo doesn't go to Tokyo Game Show?

27:29.360 --> 27:30.360
I'll state the obvious there.

27:30.360 --> 27:35.580
Is it maybe that people are just, you know, they're, because the ooh and aahs of Sony

27:35.580 --> 27:38.880
being there, they're just loving that, and that's kind of skewing their view a little

27:38.880 --> 27:39.880
bit, or what?

27:39.880 --> 27:45.800
I think my old theory stands is that it has to do with getting a Blu-ray.

27:45.800 --> 27:49.440
I mean, honestly, I think that the Japanese market is looking at the whole Blu-ray thing

27:49.440 --> 27:50.440
as a positive.

27:50.440 --> 27:55.260
I mean, having a DVD player in it is what sold the PS2, because at the time, it was

27:55.260 --> 28:00.820
a lot cheaper to get a PS2 than to go out and just buy a DVD player.

28:00.820 --> 28:03.640
I think that they're looking for that multiple functionality.

28:03.640 --> 28:04.640
Interesting.

28:04.640 --> 28:09.300
I'm looking at our chat room to see what they say here.

28:09.300 --> 28:13.840
Some folks, Fireboma says, Tokyo Game Show is mostly fanboys.

28:13.840 --> 28:17.800
Nintendo wasn't at Tokyo Game Show, so their fans weren't there.

28:17.800 --> 28:22.080
And some interesting, Nintendo Maniac 64 says, oh, the poll was probably done that way probably

28:22.080 --> 28:24.400
because the 360 is already out.

28:24.400 --> 28:28.020
So okay, that makes sense why they didn't include 360 in the poll.

28:28.020 --> 28:32.240
But what about some of those, well, I don't know if, I can't remember if we get into it

28:32.240 --> 28:35.640
later in the program, but I'll just quickly say, what about some of those 360 games that

28:35.640 --> 28:37.880
are being shown at Tokyo Game Show?

28:37.880 --> 28:41.680
I mean, do you think that this might sway the Japanese public at all?

28:41.680 --> 28:46.120
I mean, I was watching the demo for Blue Dragon, some of the gameplay video, it looked pretty

28:46.120 --> 28:47.120
hot.

28:47.120 --> 28:51.080
So I don't know, is it going to be enough, or is it too little too late?

28:51.080 --> 28:53.080
I guess we'll see.

28:53.080 --> 29:01.080
Well, as far as the PS3 itself, you know, where they were going to have the price drop

29:01.080 --> 29:06.280
in Japan, we are not quite so lucky here.

29:06.280 --> 29:12.680
There's basically stating that there is no plans to drop the price in the United States.

29:12.680 --> 29:18.360
It's still going to be 499 for the low end, 599 for the 60 gig version.

29:18.360 --> 29:25.400
There hasn't been any set word if that's going to apply to Europe as well, and they're still

29:25.400 --> 29:29.760
set for 2007 launch in March.

29:29.760 --> 29:30.760
Pretty interesting.

29:30.760 --> 29:33.660
A lot of them might have to do with how it works here.

29:33.660 --> 29:37.600
Do you think if we have a crappy launch here in the US that Europe might get the price

29:37.600 --> 29:41.760
drop as incentive for them to go buy them?

29:41.760 --> 29:45.320
It's possible, but that's not really how Sony plays.

29:45.320 --> 29:49.640
One other thing though is that we are getting the HDMI slot on the low end system.

29:49.640 --> 29:54.160
Well, that's interesting because a lot of people were saying that your PlayStation 3

29:54.160 --> 29:59.400
would be totally gimped with no HDMI slot if in the future you choose to upgrade to

29:59.400 --> 30:01.040
an HDTV.

30:01.040 --> 30:03.000
So does this sway anyone's mind?

30:03.000 --> 30:04.040
I don't know.

30:04.040 --> 30:09.240
It's all about digitally signing those wonderful Blu-ray movies and possibly games.

30:09.240 --> 30:13.560
That is why they need that HDMI slot on there because, you know, if you don't have that

30:13.560 --> 30:16.620
then someone might be able to purchase the lower end model and, guess what, get past

30:16.620 --> 30:18.080
all that encryption.

30:18.080 --> 30:19.080
So that would be pretty nice.

30:19.080 --> 30:23.240
Well, I guess we go back to that old saying, the game system is only as good as the games

30:23.240 --> 30:28.200
that are on it, and I guess that will truly be what ends up selling these PlayStation

30:28.200 --> 30:29.200
3s or not.

30:29.200 --> 30:32.240
Yeah, and one of the games that they're hoping to sell the PlayStation 3s or at least

30:32.240 --> 30:35.040
this online service is this game, Flow.

30:35.040 --> 30:40.140
Now a lot of people may not know about Flow, or maybe you do because it's actually a

30:40.140 --> 30:43.400
game that's already on the web for free.

30:43.400 --> 30:46.360
Kind of funny because they're trying to sell the game.

30:46.360 --> 30:50.100
Not saying it's a bad game, it's actually a pretty fun game, and you can check it out

30:50.100 --> 30:52.100
online.

30:52.100 --> 30:53.100
Just do a search for Flow.

30:53.100 --> 30:55.760
It's a pretty cool little thing they were talking about.

30:55.760 --> 30:57.440
It was actually kind of an experiment.

30:57.440 --> 31:02.200
You know, if I do a search for Flow I might get a lot of websites that aren't related

31:02.200 --> 31:04.120
to gaming at all.

31:04.120 --> 31:07.480
So perhaps you might want to specify that search a little more.

31:07.480 --> 31:08.480
Okay.

31:08.480 --> 31:14.000
Well, if you want to play Flow in the wonderful Flash version, you can do so.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.700
There's a couple different places to check it out.

31:16.700 --> 31:33.200
The first one's going to be at intihuatanai.usc.edu slash cloud slash flowing slash core dot html.

31:33.200 --> 31:35.320
So I hope you got a pen and paper for that one because...

31:35.320 --> 31:37.840
If not, rewind the show and write faster.

31:37.840 --> 31:42.960
Although, if you're looking for an easier way to actually play this, you can download

31:42.960 --> 31:49.200
copies and I believe that there's one that's mirrored on PSP updates, or PS3 updates I

31:49.200 --> 31:50.200
would imagine.

31:50.200 --> 31:57.720
But anyways, so yeah, this game is going to be downloadable and supposedly you're going

31:57.720 --> 32:02.160
to have to purchase this, which is kind of funny because isn't this going to have a browser

32:02.160 --> 32:05.840
in it anyway, so couldn't you, I don't know, go browse over to this website and play it

32:05.840 --> 32:06.840
for free?

32:06.840 --> 32:13.720
I mean, that seems kind of retarded to me, that you would be able to, I don't know, download

32:13.720 --> 32:16.480
this for free instead of paying for Sony's service.

32:16.480 --> 32:17.880
That kind of defeats the purpose of...

32:17.880 --> 32:21.560
Well, what about all those Geometry Wars clones when they were out there?

32:21.560 --> 32:26.000
You know, you could play it for free, quote unquote, online or on the other platforms

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
they were putting it on.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.440
Yeah, but you can't play it for free on the PlayStation 3.

32:29.440 --> 32:31.440
See, you can actually go with...

32:31.440 --> 32:36.520
Well, but you can't play Geometry Wars for free on the Xbox 360, that's what I'm saying.

32:36.520 --> 32:43.000
But you can, with the PlayStation 3, web browse over to this site and either download it to

32:43.000 --> 32:48.040
your hard drive and run it in Linux or you could, I don't know, play it in the web browser

32:48.040 --> 32:52.480
assuming that this thing supports Flash, I would hope so since it's a next gen console

32:52.480 --> 32:57.280
with the fucking cell processor, it should be able to support Flash.

32:57.280 --> 32:59.280
So yeah, you could play this game.

32:59.280 --> 33:07.160
Ota G says, but it's in HD, but who cares?

33:07.160 --> 33:11.720
It's going to be in HD anyways because it's going to be on your TV.

33:11.720 --> 33:12.720
I don't know.

33:12.720 --> 33:13.720
I just think it's a waste of money.

33:13.720 --> 33:18.220
All right, well this was certainly a controversial story in the scene this week regarding the

33:18.220 --> 33:22.880
PlayStation 3 and it has to do with Gran Turismo HD.

33:22.880 --> 33:26.040
And now there's these stories that have been going around about the fact that there's going

33:26.040 --> 33:31.080
to be this Gran Turismo HD classic that's going to be kind of the entry into the GT

33:31.080 --> 33:36.440
series and then there's going to be, I guess, 750 cars that you can download online for

33:36.440 --> 33:41.520
between 50 cents to a dollar a piece and 50 tracks between a dollar fifty and four fifty

33:41.520 --> 33:42.520
a piece.

33:42.520 --> 33:47.160
They're all the cars that have been basically created for the Gran Turismo series for the

33:47.160 --> 33:48.160
last 10 years.

33:48.160 --> 33:52.040
But Gran Turismo HD Premium will come with two courses and 30 cars.

33:52.040 --> 33:59.840
Yes, the Premium is going to be basically kind of a test model for Gran Turismo 5.

33:59.840 --> 34:03.360
It's basically really detailed looking cars.

34:03.360 --> 34:08.000
Think like Forza or something like that and it's just really nice stuff.

34:08.000 --> 34:11.600
The reason why they don't have 750 cars in the Premium version is because they haven't

34:11.600 --> 34:14.600
had a chance to create the models for all the cars yet.

34:14.600 --> 34:24.720
They're really hurrying to get this game pushed out, which screams flaws up the ass.

34:24.720 --> 34:29.880
Basically the classic version, I guess, is going to be an upscaled version of Gran Turismo

34:29.880 --> 34:32.960
4 with all those wonderful cars to purchase.

34:32.960 --> 34:36.880
So you're saying if I go to the store and buy this Gran Turismo classic, I can't do

34:36.880 --> 34:37.880
anything with it?

34:37.880 --> 34:40.920
Well, Classic and Premium are in one game.

34:40.920 --> 34:41.920
It's different modes.

34:41.920 --> 34:42.920
Oh, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

34:42.920 --> 34:44.960
Oh, I made it sound like it was two separate games.

34:44.960 --> 34:48.000
No, it's just one game.

34:48.000 --> 34:52.600
You will get some cars, but if you think about it, 30 cars in two tracks is a lot less than

34:52.600 --> 35:00.000
say 250 that I'm used to getting at the store for $49.99 for PlayStation 2.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.360
Huh, interesting.

35:02.360 --> 35:05.320
I don't know, what do you think about this microtransaction thing?

35:05.320 --> 35:06.600
Well, here's the thing.

35:06.600 --> 35:09.580
It doesn't stop at cars or tracks.

35:09.580 --> 35:13.520
They're going to be adding parts and skins for your cars as well.

35:13.520 --> 35:17.440
They want it to become the iTunes of Gran Turismo, so you're going to be spending thousands

35:17.440 --> 35:22.240
of dollars, hopefully, on this crap for one game.

35:22.240 --> 35:27.800
Well, I think about Test Drive Unlimited, which is something I've been playing a lot

35:27.800 --> 35:32.880
recently that also has a crap load of cars and a crap load of parts and things that you

35:32.880 --> 35:38.160
can get with it, but you unlock them naturally as you go to the in-game store.

35:38.160 --> 35:41.720
And none of this microtransaction crap, you know, you buy the game and all this stuff

35:41.720 --> 35:42.720
is included.

35:42.720 --> 35:45.460
You unlock it within the game, and that's what we're all kind of used to.

35:45.460 --> 35:47.520
And here's the other fun thing about this, too.

35:47.520 --> 35:54.060
They were saying that a lot of the cars in this, they're going to be expensive because

35:54.060 --> 36:02.920
they want you to actually be, you know, just kind of having that, I guess, other people

36:02.920 --> 36:03.920
have expensive cars.

36:03.920 --> 36:06.080
Ooh, I've got to have that expensive car.

36:06.080 --> 36:09.200
It's not going to be, it's actually going to be expensive.

36:09.200 --> 36:11.800
Do I get to buy horse armor for said car?

36:11.800 --> 36:14.720
Well, if it were a horse, maybe, no.

36:14.720 --> 36:18.880
But the whole thing screams to me as a bad idea.

36:18.880 --> 36:22.400
And I think a lot of people, I mean, they may be fans of Gran Turismo, but who's really

36:22.400 --> 36:24.360
going to pay for all the cars?

36:24.360 --> 36:29.320
I mean, that's just like saying, oh, here's Madden NFL.

36:29.320 --> 36:32.160
By the way, there's no teams or arenas included.

36:32.160 --> 36:33.960
You have to purchase those separately.

36:33.960 --> 36:37.440
Oh, by the way, the football's not included either, you know.

36:37.440 --> 36:45.640
It's like buying a car without tires or an engine or seats or a body, I mean, it's retarded.

36:45.640 --> 36:48.400
So what exactly am I paying for here?

36:48.400 --> 36:53.560
TigerKlon's chat says, maybe you end up buying rims and spinners for the cars.

36:53.560 --> 36:56.960
And that's the other thing, too, about these cars.

36:56.960 --> 37:01.680
Haz says, I want to buy a pine air freshener for my car, a little fuzzy dice that can hang

37:01.680 --> 37:03.000
from them.

37:03.000 --> 37:11.000
I mean, why would you spend all this money on this?

37:11.000 --> 37:14.520
I really don't see people doing this, because I know they're really trying to push this

37:14.520 --> 37:18.880
microtransaction thing, and if it goes well, you can better believe that Gran Turismo 5

37:18.880 --> 37:21.200
is going to be the same thing.

37:21.200 --> 37:26.520
Is there a possibility here that this whole thing's being grossly misinterpreted or something's

37:26.520 --> 37:27.520
wrong here?

37:27.520 --> 37:30.600
Because I know on the internet this week it was a little bit back and forth, rumor or

37:30.600 --> 37:31.600
not rumor.

37:31.600 --> 37:39.680
I had several interviews actually with the head people for the lead on Gran Turismo HD,

37:39.680 --> 37:41.240
and they've confirmed this stuff.

37:41.240 --> 37:45.480
Now the thing they haven't confirmed, at least they didn't say anything about the pricing

37:45.480 --> 37:51.280
on this and whether a lot of people aren't probably going to be buying 750 cars.

37:51.280 --> 37:53.000
That's a fact.

37:53.000 --> 37:59.180
But they didn't mention, well, if I purchase, say, a Honda Civic or something and someone

37:59.180 --> 38:04.200
purchases a Lamborghini, I mean, am I going to purchase a more expensive car to be able

38:04.200 --> 38:11.240
to race against these people, because they're going to be smoking me in this soup of cars.

38:11.240 --> 38:15.400
I think the whole thing's a bad idea, and I know there's been a lot of comparisons to

38:15.400 --> 38:20.760
Project Gotham Racing 3, but I kind of find it a little bit, you know, that game does

38:20.760 --> 38:22.560
actually come with cars and tracks.

38:22.560 --> 38:27.020
In fact, I think quite an unlimited amount of tracks since you can create your own courses

38:27.020 --> 38:31.960
in there, but the fact is I don't have to purchase these cars in order to be able to

38:31.960 --> 38:36.340
enjoy the game, whereas if I want to play the online version of Classic, yes, you do

38:36.340 --> 38:39.920
have to purchase those cars, and yes, you do have to purchase those tracks.

38:39.920 --> 38:43.760
So I think it's kind of retarded that I should have to spend money on a game that I already

38:43.760 --> 38:45.320
spent money on.

38:45.320 --> 38:46.400
Interesting.

38:46.400 --> 38:47.640
More interesting comments from chat.

38:47.640 --> 38:48.640
They're just lit up on this.

38:48.640 --> 38:53.800
Funny Dale says, Sony is going to make players of Gran Turismo HD pay $5 a gallon for virtual

38:53.800 --> 38:54.800
gasoline.

38:54.800 --> 38:58.320
PlayStation 3, this is really living.

38:58.320 --> 39:00.240
Funny.

39:00.240 --> 39:03.720
Stick Axe, you know, a little bit of a counterpoint here.

39:03.720 --> 39:08.360
If the game was cheap, and if I only like a few tracks, I don't have to spend $40 for

39:08.360 --> 39:10.840
a game I only want half of.

39:10.840 --> 39:17.000
True, and the whole thing is, you know, the Gran Turismo HD Premium or whatever, it's

39:17.000 --> 39:21.840
just a fucking demo for Gran Turismo 5 is basically what it is.

39:21.840 --> 39:24.960
You know, why should I pay for an upscaled version of 4?

39:24.960 --> 39:31.880
Seeing as you can buy 4 and upscale it anyways, you know, why the hell, well first off, if

39:31.880 --> 39:35.400
I were ever to buy PlayStation 3, I would never be buying this game at all.

39:35.400 --> 39:38.160
I mean, I would not touch this game with a 10 foot pole.

39:38.160 --> 39:41.320
I would wait for a better racing game to come out, because you know what, there's going

39:41.320 --> 39:43.480
to be a lot more out there.

39:43.480 --> 39:47.640
The only way I could ever see this selling is if it were like $10 for the core of it,

39:47.640 --> 39:49.920
and then everything else you can pay for.

39:49.920 --> 39:54.480
If it were like, you know, you can buy 200 cars for $20 or something like that, then

39:54.480 --> 39:58.920
maybe yeah, someone might go ahead and do that, but if I'm paying a buck a car, and

39:58.920 --> 40:04.800
they want me to spend $900 on fucking cars, alright, that's going to happen.

40:04.800 --> 40:11.220
I think that they did it very well for, what was it, Project Gotham 3 on Xbox 360 where

40:11.220 --> 40:13.520
they had car packets.

40:13.520 --> 40:18.080
Where you spend this number of points, you get a certain set of cards, like the Ferrari

40:18.080 --> 40:20.480
packet or the Mustang packet or something like that.

40:20.480 --> 40:24.400
And some were, but you still, you didn't really have to get those to enjoy the full experience

40:24.400 --> 40:27.760
of the game, and there were also a lot of bonus cards that were commercially subsidized

40:27.760 --> 40:28.760
or something like that.

40:28.760 --> 40:32.120
Like you could get the card that had the Xbox 360 logo on it and some of that other stuff,

40:32.120 --> 40:33.760
you know, so.

40:33.760 --> 40:39.240
But how is this different from that Project Gotham 3 pack?

40:39.240 --> 40:42.840
It comes because Project Gotham 3 actually is a full game without them?

40:42.840 --> 40:43.840
Yeah, it's a full game.

40:43.840 --> 40:48.040
You do not need to have these cars in order to enjoy the game.

40:48.040 --> 40:52.000
It's kind of an added bonus if you want to buy the cars, then yeah, you can go ahead

40:52.000 --> 40:53.240
and do that.

40:53.240 --> 40:58.700
You don't need them to play online, whereas this, you will need to play online.

40:58.700 --> 41:02.520
You will need to purchase the cars, and I also have, I don't have a problem with purchasing

41:02.520 --> 41:06.120
the cars, you know, so much as I have a problem with purchasing the tracks, too.

41:06.120 --> 41:08.240
I mean, that's kind of retarded.

41:08.240 --> 41:11.020
Why should I have to purchase elements of this game?

41:11.020 --> 41:14.600
What the fuck are you using the Blu-ray Disc for anyways, because it's obviously not storing

41:14.600 --> 41:16.280
all these tracks and cars.

41:16.280 --> 41:19.960
Alright, we're going to leave with a couple of chat comments here, and then we'll move

41:19.960 --> 41:20.960
on here.

41:20.960 --> 41:24.880
Gita in chat says, I don't really care, waiting for Need for Speed Carbon.

41:24.880 --> 41:28.240
And Nintendo Maniac 64 says Excite Truck for the win.

41:28.240 --> 41:32.480
So sounds like some people are just going to take their money elsewhere, we'll see.

41:32.480 --> 41:39.400
Well anyways, there's actually some interesting stuff coming out other than Gran Turismo HD,

41:39.400 --> 41:44.040
and that is our favorite game to talk about, Africa.

41:44.040 --> 41:45.400
What the hell is Africa?

41:45.400 --> 41:50.120
Well, that's kind of funny, because it's actually kind of what we thought it would be.

41:50.120 --> 41:56.360
It's basically a virtual African safari, where you can take pictures and basically keep them.

41:56.360 --> 41:59.000
It's Pokemon Snap with drafts.

41:59.000 --> 42:04.320
Exactly, but it's not really a game, though.

42:04.320 --> 42:10.420
It's basically a virtual safari, virtual Africa, where you get to see animals and basically

42:10.420 --> 42:13.280
experience Africa without going to Africa.

42:13.280 --> 42:16.200
Did Elton John do the music and Tim Rice the lyrics?

42:16.200 --> 42:17.200
I don't know.

42:17.200 --> 42:18.200
Don't care.

42:18.200 --> 42:19.200
You know what?

42:19.200 --> 42:21.440
I like Jumbo Safari, because you can harpoon animals.

42:21.440 --> 42:22.440
It's the same thing.

42:22.440 --> 42:23.520
Well, you know what I wanted?

42:23.520 --> 42:24.680
That game is the shit right there.

42:24.680 --> 42:26.680
I love that fucking safari game.

42:26.680 --> 42:28.600
That's what this fucking Africa game needs to be.

42:28.600 --> 42:29.600
Jumbo Safari!

42:29.600 --> 42:32.320
Do we fucking have Jumbo Safari on the consoles anywhere?

42:32.320 --> 42:36.040
No, but I think a Walmart in town still has one.

42:36.040 --> 42:37.400
That fucking game is the shit.

42:37.400 --> 42:41.280
I swear to God, if you have an arcade near you that has a Jumbo Safari, you need to pour

42:41.280 --> 42:42.280
thousands of dollars.

42:42.280 --> 42:43.280
We'll take that $900.

42:43.280 --> 42:49.000
Real quick, in-studio, I have the trailer running right now for Africa, and granted,

42:49.000 --> 42:50.320
it looks fucking amazing.

42:50.320 --> 42:51.920
Yeah, it's pretty.

42:51.920 --> 42:56.120
It's very pretty, but the thing is, it's like, what the hell is this?

42:56.120 --> 43:01.120
It's Africa, and there's grass.

43:01.120 --> 43:02.120
It's the barons.

43:02.120 --> 43:04.000
And there's birds and stuff.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
It's Chuck Norris.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.560
Yes, it's the barons without Chuck Norris jokes.

43:07.560 --> 43:08.560
What more do you need?

43:08.560 --> 43:13.920
So, granted, okay, great, it's Elephants, it's the Discovery Channel, you know.

43:13.920 --> 43:18.200
That's basically kind of what it seems to me to be, but, I don't know, do we really

43:18.200 --> 43:19.200
want, you know.

43:19.200 --> 43:20.200
Peppa Lumps!

43:20.200 --> 43:22.720
Do you really need to, like, buy this stuff?

43:22.720 --> 43:24.480
Here's the game I would recommend buying.

43:24.480 --> 43:26.160
Cabela's African Safari.

43:26.160 --> 43:31.000
You get to go destroy, you know, elephants and rhinos and stuff.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.280
Yes, they have cheetahs and stuff.

43:33.280 --> 43:39.240
I want to see, like, the whole true circle of life where, like, they eat animals.

43:39.240 --> 43:40.680
Ooh, hyenas.

43:40.680 --> 43:43.040
It's Africa, and look at, they're eating animals.

43:43.040 --> 43:47.920
Look at the cute hyena eating the carcass.

43:47.920 --> 43:49.320
Then suddenly out of nowhere, crikey!

43:49.320 --> 43:51.320
Oh, wait, bad taste, sorry, bad taste.

43:51.320 --> 43:53.480
It's staying right through my heart!

43:53.480 --> 43:54.480
Bad taste.

43:54.480 --> 43:56.120
Oh, the hippo wiggling his little ears.

43:56.120 --> 43:57.120
It looks great.

43:57.120 --> 43:59.040
I mean, this looks really, really good.

43:59.040 --> 44:02.960
It's just, I think that, you know, they should do, maybe this is just the opening movie,

44:02.960 --> 44:04.960
like how often do we get pissed off at that?

44:04.960 --> 44:09.200
Like, you know, you see the opening movie, and then, like, the game looks nothing like

44:09.200 --> 44:10.200
it.

44:10.200 --> 44:11.200
You know what I mean?

44:11.200 --> 44:14.360
Oh, you mean, like, kind of like, oh, I don't know, Motorstorm?

44:14.360 --> 44:16.080
Ooh, pretty.

44:16.080 --> 44:22.440
So granted, okay, this is, you know, really cool and stuff, but I don't know, I don't

44:22.440 --> 44:23.440
know if this-

44:23.440 --> 44:24.440
It does look amazing.

44:24.440 --> 44:26.440
I mean, graphically, it's, but yeah, what the hell is it?

44:26.440 --> 44:29.400
It's like, I don't need tech demos as a fucking game.

44:29.400 --> 44:30.960
Yeah, you're just-

44:30.960 --> 44:31.960
Dan?

44:31.960 --> 44:32.960
Wait a minute.

44:32.960 --> 44:33.960
They cut it off before he ate the gazelle!

44:33.960 --> 44:37.440
Aren't you the same person that said you were wanting to get a copy of Wii Play from Japan?

44:37.440 --> 44:38.440
Yeah, because that's fun.

44:38.440 --> 44:40.440
I don't want tech demos as a game.

44:40.440 --> 44:45.520
Yeah, tech demos as in, like, okay, here's ducks, okay, and look at the ducks.

44:45.520 --> 44:48.880
Oh my god, Jeremy Todd 1 is great.

44:48.880 --> 44:49.880
What do you say?

44:49.880 --> 44:53.480
In Africa, you will be able to hunt down your favorite species of rare animals and take

44:53.480 --> 44:54.480
pictures of them.

44:54.480 --> 44:57.840
On rare nights, usually nights with a full moon, you will be able to see Chuck Norris

44:57.840 --> 45:00.360
running around killing elephants with his bare hands.

45:00.360 --> 45:04.400
Take a picture for massive damage.

45:04.400 --> 45:05.400
That was beautiful.

45:05.400 --> 45:06.400
That's great.

45:06.400 --> 45:07.720
You win the chatroom cookie.

45:07.720 --> 45:15.340
Well, like I said, you know, it's a nice game, and you know, I hope that there's more to

45:15.340 --> 45:18.040
it than just, you know, look at the pretty animals.

45:18.040 --> 45:23.560
Well, I don't know, I'm looking, you know, I sort of think that I would play that, but

45:23.560 --> 45:28.760
then again, I also did play a whole bunch of Pokemon Snap, but you know, something that

45:28.760 --> 45:36.520
I will play, because I'm probably going to get a PS3, is Ninja Gaiden coming out on PS3.

45:36.520 --> 45:43.040
According to Famitsu, there is going to be one called Ninja Gaiden Sigma, which you will

45:43.040 --> 45:48.600
play as Rachel from Ninja Gaiden Black.

45:48.600 --> 45:54.560
And it was actually also revealed that Itagaki was saying that there was going to be a Ninja

45:54.560 --> 46:00.920
Gaiden 2, and it wasn't stating that it was the same project.

46:00.920 --> 46:07.960
There's also a theory that this is going to be a remake of Ninja Gaiden Black with extras.

46:07.960 --> 46:12.800
And there's also been no statement on if it's going to be specific just to the PS3 or if

46:12.800 --> 46:14.120
it will see multiple systems.

46:14.120 --> 46:15.880
I think it'll see multiple systems.

46:15.880 --> 46:16.880
Probably.

46:16.880 --> 46:24.520
I know Ninja Gaiden Black did really well on the Xbox, so I wouldn't see why they wouldn't

46:24.520 --> 46:25.920
try to make a 360 version.

46:25.920 --> 46:29.000
They've got a fan base.

46:29.000 --> 46:30.000
Exactly.

46:30.000 --> 46:33.840
There was actually some pretty cool stuff from Tokyo Game Show this week.

46:33.840 --> 46:38.920
Microsoft is doing this brand new Bring It Home.

46:38.920 --> 46:42.520
They're covering both Tokyo Game Show and X06, which is going to be taking place in

46:42.520 --> 46:45.240
Barcelona next week.

46:45.240 --> 46:50.400
Some pretty cool stuff though so far, we've had some demos, videos, themes, mainly just

46:50.400 --> 46:52.480
kind of some of the stuff you don't get to see.

46:52.480 --> 46:57.160
I like the demo thing because they did it during E3 and got some pretty good demos from

46:57.160 --> 46:58.160
that.

46:58.160 --> 47:00.440
Hopefully you're going to see some more stuff as far as demos go.

47:00.440 --> 47:04.760
I know that there's Sonic the Hedgehog is supposed to be next week at some point, so

47:04.760 --> 47:06.320
that'd be cool.

47:06.320 --> 47:09.920
Maybe even some more Japanese exclusive demos would be nice because I get to play those

47:09.920 --> 47:12.280
anyways.

47:12.280 --> 47:13.440
Just stuff like that.

47:13.440 --> 47:19.240
So I like how they're doing this and hopefully we'll see some more stuff that come out pretty

47:19.240 --> 47:20.240
soon.

47:20.240 --> 47:26.480
Well, as far as things that are coming out relatively soon, at the Tokyo Game Show, Microsoft

47:26.480 --> 47:32.440
had a press release stating what new live arcade games were going to be coming out.

47:32.440 --> 47:39.360
Included were Contra, Gyruss, Dig Dug, Track and Field, New Rally X, Russian Attack, Ms.

47:39.360 --> 47:45.440
Pac-Man, and exclusive for the Japanese audience, Yaya Kung Fu.

47:45.440 --> 47:46.440
That's pretty cool.

47:46.440 --> 47:50.400
I wonder if I can play that since I have my Japanese account.

47:50.400 --> 47:51.400
Don't bother.

47:51.400 --> 47:52.400
I don't like Yaya Kung Fu.

47:52.400 --> 47:55.480
I know a lot of people have a lot of love for that game.

47:55.480 --> 47:59.400
I don't think it's this amazing fighting game people make it out to be.

47:59.400 --> 48:02.080
It's what practically started the genre.

48:02.080 --> 48:03.880
I'll try it.

48:03.880 --> 48:04.880
I don't know.

48:04.880 --> 48:05.880
Not my favorite.

48:05.880 --> 48:09.520
I do have the free demo versions you can try out.

48:09.520 --> 48:12.960
JIRUS, on the other hand, bring it.

48:12.960 --> 48:13.960
Freaking love JIRUS.

48:13.960 --> 48:16.760
I'm so there when JIRUS comes out.

48:16.760 --> 48:23.360
Some interesting things were found out this week, or at least have been brought to light.

48:23.360 --> 48:30.240
The fact that you can copy your Xbox Live arcade games onto a CD-R or DVD-R and be able

48:30.240 --> 48:32.480
to play them on your system.

48:32.480 --> 48:33.480
Why is this important?

48:33.480 --> 48:36.720
Because not everyone out there has a hard drive for their system, as much as I'd like

48:36.720 --> 48:42.240
to think so, and also that the memory units are quite limited on what you can put on there.

48:42.240 --> 48:49.560
Now, there's a big, huge how-to on 360gamesaves.com if you want to know how to do this.

48:49.560 --> 48:50.560
It's kind of funny.

48:50.560 --> 48:55.000
One of the things that they actually have been able to do is pull off the full version

48:55.000 --> 49:01.040
of Hexac HD, so if you don't have a hard drive, you can actually play it on your system.

49:01.040 --> 49:08.000
It's basically as simple as bringing them into a certain directory structure on your

49:08.000 --> 49:12.680
recordable media and basically popping it in, and they will populate your Xbox Live

49:12.680 --> 49:15.400
arcade list there, which is pretty cool.

49:15.400 --> 49:19.440
And if you do have them registered on your system, they will be the full version, otherwise

49:19.440 --> 49:22.800
they are a demo.

49:22.800 --> 49:26.120
So when might somebody want to actually use this?

49:26.120 --> 49:31.440
If they don't have a hard drive, or if they're just stuck to just a simple memory unit, they

49:31.440 --> 49:37.260
might, I don't know, if they have the extra cables or whatever to transfer them off the

49:37.260 --> 49:41.680
memory unit onto, say, your computer, which that stuff is available out there.

49:41.680 --> 49:45.960
I know Datel has kind of a cable for that.

49:45.960 --> 49:48.260
That might be something that you can use this for.

49:48.260 --> 49:54.520
Or say, if someone actually does the kind of not-legit thing and takes all the demos

49:54.520 --> 50:00.200
and puts them on a disk image and distributes that over the internet, which would be cool.

50:00.200 --> 50:03.480
And I think that should be something that Microsoft should do anyways, because I know

50:03.480 --> 50:08.160
that, well, I know they were trying to push their Xbox Live arcade unplugged, but this

50:08.160 --> 50:11.600
way if you could download all the demos, say, to a disk image, kind of like how they have

50:11.600 --> 50:15.680
the backwards compatibility updates, that would be pretty cool as well.

50:15.680 --> 50:18.840
You can just burn it onto the disk and then pop it in there and you have all the demos

50:18.840 --> 50:24.400
for all the games, and then you can just register them, I guess, somehow.

50:24.400 --> 50:27.400
That's kind of a problem if you don't have Live, I guess.

50:27.400 --> 50:30.120
And how is piracy going to be prevented again?

50:30.120 --> 50:34.200
The way piracy is prevented on it is actually that you're not going to be able to...

50:34.200 --> 50:38.920
The games are only demo versions unless it's registered to your account.

50:38.920 --> 50:39.920
Interesting.

50:39.920 --> 50:43.600
Oh, yeah, because sometimes I start up Geometry Wars and it looks like it's a demo and then

50:43.600 --> 50:46.480
suddenly it switches over and it says, oh, never mind, it's a demo version.

50:46.480 --> 50:50.020
Yeah, because whether the register or not is based on your account.

50:50.020 --> 50:51.840
You can't just download a registered version.

50:51.840 --> 50:52.840
Gotcha.

50:52.840 --> 50:57.800
All right, well, speaking of the 360, we have a very exciting announcement for the 360.

50:57.800 --> 51:01.640
At least I know a lot of our import game fans are going to love this because these were

51:01.640 --> 51:02.640
huge games.

51:02.640 --> 51:06.000
Well, they were released here too, but it seems to appeal to that same audience.

51:06.000 --> 51:11.000
Radiant Silver Gun and Ikarugan, you might recognize these two shooter titles.

51:11.000 --> 51:17.120
Well, did you know that this was always planned to be a trilogy?

51:17.120 --> 51:18.120
And guess what?

51:18.120 --> 51:25.520
Treasure has announced that they will be making a third game in the series for the Xbox 360.

51:25.520 --> 51:26.520
That's all we know.

51:26.520 --> 51:27.520
Treasure loves us.

51:27.520 --> 51:28.520
That's all we know.

51:28.520 --> 51:33.760
We don't know when, where, how, what, we just know that Treasure's making it and it's coming

51:33.760 --> 51:34.760
to the 360.

51:34.760 --> 51:37.540
Dude, I love Radiant Silver Gun so much.

51:37.540 --> 51:39.720
So now will you play your 360, Jamie?

51:39.720 --> 51:40.720
Yes.

51:40.720 --> 51:42.160
Oh, my God.

51:42.160 --> 51:47.020
I played the hell out of Radiant Silver Gun at that one arcade in Las Vegas before they

51:47.020 --> 51:48.240
shut down.

51:48.240 --> 51:49.920
I was like, Radiant Silver Gun.

51:49.920 --> 51:51.680
Everyone else was all playing Mambo A Go Go.

51:51.680 --> 51:53.880
I'm like, screw that.

51:53.880 --> 51:54.880
Radiant Silver Gun.

51:54.880 --> 51:56.080
They couldn't get me off the machine.

51:56.080 --> 52:00.260
What's interesting about that, I think, is that those games are usually very vertical

52:00.260 --> 52:06.060
in nature, yet now the Xbox 360 supports widescreen and all their games have to support widescreen.

52:06.060 --> 52:10.400
So it's going to be interesting what all that new horizontalness does to the game, don't

52:10.400 --> 52:11.400
you think?

52:11.400 --> 52:15.560
I actually used sort of for seeing something like, what was it, Thunder Force V. Didn't

52:15.560 --> 52:20.040
that one have a lot of the rotational, where it would go one way and then rotate the other

52:20.040 --> 52:21.040
way?

52:21.040 --> 52:24.920
Maybe it wasn't Thunder Force V. Maybe I'm thinking of Vinehonder.

52:24.920 --> 52:28.520
Vinehonder did a lot of vertical and horizontal scrolling in their games.

52:28.520 --> 52:29.520
And Salamander.

52:29.520 --> 52:31.720
Salamander actually did both, too.

52:31.720 --> 52:33.500
Maybe they'll make a new Vinehonder.

52:33.500 --> 52:34.500
It's about time.

52:34.500 --> 52:37.000
If they did, it'd be Vinehonder.

52:37.000 --> 52:38.000
Yeah.

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
Anyway.

52:39.000 --> 52:42.320
So, how about some release dates, y'all?

52:42.320 --> 52:46.940
Of course, we will start off with our UK release dates.

52:46.940 --> 52:49.600
Some okay stuff, I guess.

52:49.600 --> 52:56.200
You know, it would help if my laptop wouldn't come unplugged when I'm trying to pull up

52:56.200 --> 52:57.200
the dates.

52:57.200 --> 52:58.200
Sorry, guys.

52:58.200 --> 53:00.800
I just got a little bit of a hang up.

53:00.800 --> 53:01.800
Okay.

53:01.800 --> 53:02.800
Yeah, the internet's acting funny tonight.

53:02.800 --> 53:05.880
Our chat room's all crazy tonight, so live radio, folks.

53:05.880 --> 53:08.360
The internet's not acting funny for me.

53:08.360 --> 53:12.480
The fact that my computer came unplugged and my battery was going WTF.

53:12.480 --> 53:13.640
Okay.

53:13.640 --> 53:17.560
So how about our UK release dates, take two?

53:17.560 --> 53:23.900
On the 25th, which it probably already is in the UK, Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2, March

53:23.900 --> 53:25.640
of the Minis, coming out.

53:25.640 --> 53:33.720
On the 29th, 42 all-time classics coming out on the DS, Age of Empires, Age of Kings, Black

53:33.720 --> 53:40.680
Buccaneer on PC, Xbox, and Playstation 2, Company of Heroes on PC, Devil May Cry 3,

53:40.680 --> 53:47.640
Dante's Awakening, Special Edition, that's a cool game, guys, get it, Infrared, and Kingdom

53:47.640 --> 53:52.080
Hearts 2 coming out on Playstation 2, Mercury Meltdown also.

53:52.080 --> 53:55.880
On the 30th, Mad Tracks coming out on Xbox 360.

53:55.880 --> 53:57.600
Excellent.

53:57.600 --> 53:59.200
There's some pretty cool stuff coming out.

53:59.200 --> 54:04.040
I hope Mad Tracks is coming out, because that'd be pretty awesome, I want to play that.

54:04.040 --> 54:12.360
Four, of course, I gotta mention this first, the big game for Playstation 2 this week,

54:12.360 --> 54:16.440
Dance Dance Revolution, Supernova, of course, will be coming out.

54:16.440 --> 54:19.800
I have heard, though, that the bundle might be delayed, so if you don't have a dance

54:19.800 --> 54:25.480
pad yet, which I don't see why you wouldn't, you might be waiting a little bit.

54:25.480 --> 54:31.880
Of course, on the Playstation 2, we also have, or actually, Playstation 2, Xbox, the 360,

54:31.880 --> 54:37.840
and PSP, NBA Live 07, and then if you're not a fan of Live, NBA 2K7 is coming out on

54:37.840 --> 54:40.280
Playstation 2, Xbox, and the 360.

54:40.280 --> 54:44.800
If you're not a fan of basketball, maybe you're a fan of racing games, in which case,

54:44.800 --> 54:45.920
you've got a couple things.

54:45.920 --> 54:49.680
The first one's going to be The Fast and the Furious on Playstation 2, loosely based

54:49.680 --> 54:58.680
on Tokyo Drift, and Import Tuner Challenge on the Xbox 360, which there was a rumor that

54:58.680 --> 55:04.280
that was going to be $29.99 at Best Buy, that is a typo.

55:04.280 --> 55:09.640
Then of course, Just Cause will be coming out on Xbox 360, the Xbox, and Playstation

55:09.640 --> 55:15.320
2, as well as the PC, and some other fun stuff.

55:15.320 --> 55:20.440
On the GameCube, Beethoven Kato's Origins will be coming out, one of the last role-playing

55:20.440 --> 55:24.760
games actually made by Nintendo for the GameCube, so check that out.

55:24.760 --> 55:30.260
As well as, the Game Boy Advance will be getting some re-releases, including Pokémon Fire

55:30.260 --> 55:39.060
Red as part of the Greatest Hits, and Leaf Green, and of course, there's some pretty

55:39.060 --> 55:41.760
good stuff coming out.

55:41.760 --> 55:45.680
Import Bold Move Street Racing, if you're a racing fan on the Playstation 2, kind of

55:45.680 --> 55:49.760
a budget game, and Greg Hastings' Tournament Paintball Max, which the game is about a year

55:49.760 --> 55:56.240
old now, but still, you might want to play it in Valkyrie Profile 2, Cymera, on the Playstation

55:56.240 --> 55:57.240
2.

55:57.240 --> 56:00.120
Alright, well this is the part of the show where I would do Japanese release dates, but

56:00.120 --> 56:03.840
the site I get Japanese release dates from is not working right now.

56:03.840 --> 56:04.840
No problem then.

56:04.840 --> 56:05.840
Oh, do you have it?

56:05.840 --> 56:07.360
No, I'll just talk about some other stuff then.

56:07.360 --> 56:11.400
Well no, I do remember too, because I remember looking at it and going, oh, I want to import

56:11.400 --> 56:12.400
those.

56:12.400 --> 56:15.840
Pop'n Music Carnival is this week in Japan, so if you're a big Pop'n Music fan, you've

56:15.840 --> 56:20.000
got a new game coming out in Japan, and I know the first game in the new.hack series

56:20.000 --> 56:25.440
is coming out this week, so if you were a fan of the.hack games,.hack infection, etc.,

56:25.440 --> 56:27.680
the new series begins this week in Japan.

56:27.680 --> 56:30.960
Sorry guys, I'll try to get the rest of them later in the show if they come up later.

56:30.960 --> 56:33.840
I just think that's plenty, a game about an MMO.

56:33.840 --> 56:38.840
And the game, like we like to do every week, a little piece of under the radar type of

56:38.840 --> 56:43.400
stuff, we've got some dates for you for brand new games coming out from a company that I

56:43.400 --> 56:48.280
really haven't heard of, Axis Games Localization, I guess they specialize in porting over some

56:48.280 --> 56:50.280
stuff from Japan.

56:50.280 --> 56:54.160
Some of the things you're going to see way distant future here, Guilty Gear for the Wii

56:54.160 --> 56:59.200
is going to be coming out September 27th of next year, as well as a generic fishing game

56:59.200 --> 57:09.200
on July 18th of 07, GISH for the PSP is coming out February 28th of 07, as well as a Guilty

57:09.200 --> 57:16.000
Gear title for the Playstation 2, entitled right now Guilty Gear Series, but I guess

57:16.000 --> 57:20.340
that's a working title for that, and that's coming out January 2nd, so look for those.

57:20.340 --> 57:26.040
If you are in the market for some Xbox 360 games, there's been a few price drops, Quake

57:26.040 --> 57:31.920
4 has dropped down to $39.99, as well as X-Men, the official game of the movie, has also dropped

57:31.920 --> 57:38.320
down for $39.99, so check those out.

57:38.320 --> 57:40.320
Alright, I will.

57:40.320 --> 57:43.280
Okay, cool.

57:43.280 --> 57:48.400
Anyways, other games that Japan is going to be seeing, and we're definitely going to be

57:48.400 --> 57:53.160
seeing at some point, Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops, one of the cool things though that we

57:53.160 --> 57:58.400
probably won't ever see over here, is going to be a Portable Ops bundle for the PSP, because

57:58.400 --> 58:02.840
they're really trying to sell the PSP since they're getting their asses handed to them

58:02.840 --> 58:07.160
by Nintendo with a DS.

58:07.160 --> 58:16.840
The wonderful little bundle is going to include a snakeskin patterned case, as well as the

58:16.840 --> 58:20.400
game and a fun little box that come with everything.

58:20.400 --> 58:25.520
So if you haven't gotten a PSP already and you're thinking about doing so, definitely

58:25.520 --> 58:26.520
check it out.

58:26.520 --> 58:29.320
Kind of the box of cigarettes and snakes' favorite brand?

58:29.320 --> 58:30.320
No?

58:30.320 --> 58:31.320
Yeah.

58:31.320 --> 58:37.520
Well, actually, it does come with an additional pouch with the logo for the game on it as

58:37.520 --> 58:45.000
well, but other than that, no real any additional bonuses to it, other than kind of a cool looking

58:45.000 --> 58:46.480
PSP box.

58:46.480 --> 58:49.320
Airsoft sniper rifle, you know.

58:49.320 --> 58:57.720
Anyway, well speaking of very cool things, Guitar Hero is going to be making it to multiple

58:57.720 --> 59:03.720
formats in 2007, so that means that y'all who missed out are going to be having your

59:03.720 --> 59:05.540
second chance.

59:05.540 --> 59:14.700
It has been announced by the chairman of Activision that, and this is a quote, that it will appear

59:14.700 --> 59:22.560
on every significant new format, while also going into some of the information about their

59:22.560 --> 59:29.160
general plan from what it looks like, as far as some of their other titles.

59:29.160 --> 59:34.200
There hasn't been an official comment by Red Octane, but they did state 2007, and also

59:34.200 --> 59:37.800
Guitar Hero 2 is supposed to be out in November.

59:37.800 --> 59:39.960
Doesn't that seem like a vague statement, though?

59:39.960 --> 59:41.840
Every significant new platform?

59:41.840 --> 59:44.320
Well, what's their idea of significant?

59:44.320 --> 59:45.320
Exactly.

59:45.320 --> 59:46.320
Maybe they just mean...

59:46.320 --> 59:47.320
Maybe they like the Wonderswan.

59:47.320 --> 59:50.800
Yeah, maybe they just mean it ain't coming for the Phantom, sorry.

59:50.800 --> 59:55.800
Do not say hoo about the Wonderswan, because it had the best home version of Beatmania.

59:55.800 --> 01:00:00.080
Well, best portable version of Beatmania.

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:03.300
Is this too much Guitar Hero?

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:05.520
Is this going to be an oversaturation of the market?

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:06.520
Nah.

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:07.520
Eh?

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:08.520
Yes.

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:09.520
Yes?

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:10.920
I just thought I'd say that.

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:17.680
I think so, because really, I think Guitar Hero is going to go the same path as Guitar

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:23.680
Freaks, where even though they still make tons of games for that, it's just, what are

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:24.680
you going to have?

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:28.320
You're not really going to be able to innovate on the gameplay any, so it's just going to

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:36.520
be brand new music each time around, and I guess DDR does change each game a little bit,

01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:37.520
at least.

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:39.400
They change some of the gameplay stuff to it.

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:43.560
I mean, can't really change too much, because, I mean, the game is pretty simple, but they

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:48.720
do change a little bit of the, you know, kind of bonus type games, instead of the challenge

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:53.760
modes and stuff like that, so I guess they could add some of that in there, maybe?

01:00:53.760 --> 01:01:00.040
I think they should do, like what Namco did with Soul Calibur II, is, you know, where

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:04.100
Soul Calibur II had different special characters on each game.

01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:08.280
They have a certain packet of songs on each game that's exclusive to just that one.

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:09.280
God, no.

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:11.720
Buy them all.

01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:12.720
Don't do that.

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:15.540
Yeah, but wouldn't that sell more games?

01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:16.540
I don't know.

01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:17.960
I think, you know, it would be sad.

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:20.080
I did own every version of Soul Calibur II.

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:24.680
I want to see how well II does, because, I mean, II, people are going to be having, you

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:29.920
know, the buy II, and they're going to be just like, they might just go, you know, okay,

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:32.040
I've seen this before, you know, who knows?

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:33.040
I don't know.

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:35.440
I think it's got a huge enough fan base, the game's going to do very well.

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:39.220
I think the game's going to do very, very well this Christmas.

01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:40.380
What do I know?

01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:45.640
I do know that an interesting story that somewhat relates to this is that a very interesting

01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:46.640
purchase has been made.

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:51.360
Of course, a while ago, it kind of, you know, turned heads when Activision acquired Red

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:52.360
Octane.

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:56.400
Well, now, the other half of Guitar Hero is Harmonix.

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:57.880
They're the ones that actually developed the game.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:04.640
Red Octane publishes it, but Harmonix developed it, and MTV Networks has purchased Harmonix.

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:05.640
Very interesting.

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:06.640
Yes, earlier this week.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:07.640
Of the evil empire.

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:12.480
MTV announced a definitive agreement to acquire Harmonix Music Systems, developer of Guitar

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:15.080
Hero, on behalf of MTV.

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:19.240
Under the terms of the transaction, MTV acquires all of the outstanding stock of Harmonix for

01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:21.680
$175 million in cash.

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:26.120
Harmonix shareholders may be eligible for incremental earn-out payments through 2008

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:30.100
to the extent that financial results exceed specific targets.

01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:34.200
This is to demonstrate MTV's commitment to music.

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:37.000
You could play videos if you want to demonstrate that.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.480
And furthers its strategy of engaging passionate music fans through a deep and immersive multi-platform

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:44.160
entertainment experience.

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:46.980
Summary, we're screwed.

01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:52.560
By the way, this means that MTV Games logo will soon show up on Guitar Hero.

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.520
Should be interesting.

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:58.240
But could it allow them to get better licenses for the game?

01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:03.320
Possibly, but I can't really see the game getting much better if MTV's label is lapped

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:04.320
on it.

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:07.640
Can they finally get Metallica?

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:08.640
I don't know.

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:11.880
Metallica can be kind of pissy when it comes to their music.

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:13.760
They're a little bit anal, but they're fine.

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:15.160
However, they are now on iTunes.

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:17.960
They are the divas of rock.

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:18.960
Seriously.

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:19.960
Alright.

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:20.960
Anyways.

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:28.920
Well, there's other music games out there, especially if you're in the UK.

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:33.900
One of those is going to be Sing Star Rocks, which Sony has announced the playlist for

01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:40.880
this, including such wonderful tracks as The Killers, Somebody Told Me, Gwen Stefani Cool,

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:48.280
Fall Out Boy, Dance Dance, Coldplay, The Speed of Sound, as well as many other fun little

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:53.040
tracks there, Elton John, Rocketman, for all those who want to do a wonderful impression

01:03:53.040 --> 01:04:00.740
of William Shatner, DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, Summertime, which I think is

01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:03.720
pretty cool, Blur Song 2.

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:04.720
Blur!

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:11.600
Let's see, here's some other good- The resident Damon Auburn fangirl is going- Scissor Sisters,

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:19.600
Take Your Mama, The Police, Every Breath You Take, Stalker Song, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Sweet

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:27.080
Home Alabama, and just other fun stuff, Good Charlotte, Girls and Boys.

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:30.160
I remember playing that Sing Star game at E3.

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:31.720
Did you really?

01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:33.980
We did Ace of Spades, me and some guy.

01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:37.080
I think you guys were off doing that when we were looking at the Eye of Judgment.

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:40.640
Yeah, you guys were off doing the Eye of Judgment, and I was like, I want to play this.

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:42.280
Ooh, they have Motorhead.

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:46.080
Yeah, I remember at E3, because we were like, oh, we have to see this Eye of Judgment, because

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:49.920
it's supposed to be this revolutionary new thing, and you're like, oh, they did Sing

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:50.920
Star.

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:54.280
And then you come out of Sing Star and you're like, eeh, and then we come out of Eye of

01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:56.040
Judgment, we're like, what the fuck was that?

01:04:56.040 --> 01:05:00.200
I'm on a giddy after freaking blocking out to Motorhead at E3.

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:02.600
It's 15 minutes, I won't get back.

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:08.680
And then, hey, DMN, shut up, no ooh, Alabama, it's ooh, Alabama, because Alabama rocks.

01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:12.320
One of the really assless people at the Eye of Judgment booth is like, what the hell is

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:13.320
this for?

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:16.600
You tried to, and they totally were like, ignoring you at one point, because you were

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:21.920
totally like, what the hell is this thing?

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:22.920
Good times.

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:26.760
Too bad there won't be an E3 next year, or, I'm sorry, in its current form.

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:30.020
Anyway, chat rooms yelling and bitching, I need to make this crush, and the MTV logo

01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:32.080
already appears on Guitar Hero 1.

01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:37.720
Sorry, I haven't, the last time I played Guitar Hero 1 was at E3, because it was one of the

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:41.960
games they had at Arena, and you know, it seems like every time you go into Arena, somebody's

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:45.360
playing Guitar Hero, so that's the last time I played it, and I didn't get to see the boot

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:46.800
up sequence at that time.

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:51.720
So maybe the signs of this acquisition were a long time coming then, you could infer from

01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:52.720
that.

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:54.440
So, sorry for my oversight, you can flog me later.

01:05:54.440 --> 01:06:00.080
I'm sure that the MTV logo being on the game is only going to make the game better.

01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:03.160
Ooh, MTV!

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:05.040
Instantly my brain has turned to jello!

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:10.000
If anything, all it will do is help promote the game, that's about it, they will be able

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:15.400
to promote it more on their shows, and do their own Guitar Hero, be a Guitar Hero TV

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:17.680
contest thing, or whatever, I don't know.

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:21.840
Having the MTV logo on Guitar Hero makes it lose instant cool points.

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:24.560
Repeat what you said, Drew Nami, because you didn't have a mic.

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:27.760
Ooh, we might just be playing the jackass theme on Guitar Hero.

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:33.360
Or yeah, they'll combine some of their franchises here, you know, what is that show, My Sweet

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:37.760
Sixteen Guitar Hero, whatever that fucking show is with the spoiled brats.

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:40.120
Hi, guess he doesn't watch TV.

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:43.240
You know what, I don't watch it very much either, but it's kind of one of those things

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:48.960
when your roommate's watching Next, you can't help but kind of look and go, God damn, I

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:51.080
weep for the youth of America.

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:55.000
It's okay, what's next, we gonna see Beavis and Butthead in the crowd?

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:59.080
That would be cool, that would be cool, because I like Beavis and Butthead.

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:00.080
Actually that would be cool.

01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:05.240
Or like have like some sort of like New Age thing, no not New Age, like New Wave and then

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:07.280
have like Daria hanging out on the side.

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:08.280
Or Nine Inch Nails concert.

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:13.920
Geeta in our chat room says, this is the true story of seven gamers picked to play a game

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:18.320
and have their lives taped.

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:23.160
Pull the gun trigger now, point it in my head and pull the trigger.

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:26.480
Moving on to other music game news, this is a little bit exciting, but yet at the same

01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:27.480
time disappointing.

01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:33.920
Word is coming via joystick from their hands on of Parappa the Rappa on the PSP.

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:38.560
The PSP demo for Parappa the Rappa, which we reported last week is coming to the PSP,

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:43.920
it's the exact same demo that the PS1 Parappa the Rappa used, which makes us think Parappa

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:49.360
the Rappa on PSP is just going to be a frickin port of Parappa the Rappa PlayStation.

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:53.320
And while Parappa the Rappa is a great game and it'll help expose it to a new generation,

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:57.920
old school fans like myself and I'm sure the others in this room can't help but weep a

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:00.160
little bit at this news.

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:04.440
Now there is some silver lining to this, the graphics have been cleaned up, the audio is

01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:10.040
a little bit crisper, the rapping guy Parappa of course still stutters, you know when you

01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:13.100
don't hit the buttons right, but I think that's kind of what they're supposed to do.

01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:18.180
Now supposedly though there is going to be a multiplayer mode, which could, you know,

01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:20.640
make this game the must own, I don't know.

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:24.400
But it should also be pointed out that there's cute little Parappa stickers for the PSP and

01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:30.080
I look at that and I go I want one right now, right now, that's hot.

01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:33.240
Consumer horror, and hell.

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:39.920
Alright we're going to bring this part A to a close here, but first we've got DDR sneak

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:44.320
peeks for you guys, that's right here on Orange Launch Radio, we've been previewing new DDR

01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:48.440
games that are coming out very soon, UltraMix 4 a little later this year as well as DDR

01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:54.320
Universe sometime this winter at some point and we've been playing about four songs a

01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:56.280
week and we're going to continue that tonight.

01:08:56.280 --> 01:09:00.640
We've got two songs from DDR UltraMix 4 and DDR Universe to play for you guys.

01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:03.560
Let's start it off with a long version because we've been throwing some long versions in

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:04.560
here.

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:08.420
This is a song that's going to be included in DDR UltraMix 4 and it's by an artist named

01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:13.120
Rupesh Kartel and this I believe is a license from the A Different Drum label and this is

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:14.120
a pretty cool song.

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:19.360
It's called Yours to Command, it's a little bit of a slow jam, enjoy this one here on

01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:20.360
Orange Launch Radio, DDR sneak peeks.

01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:41.640
I was deleting all connections to life in this town, sitting questioning just about

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:57.560
everything I've tried and I didn't need solutions, you'd be wanting me to buy, as the ring fell

01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:15.920
on the ground.

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:34.360
Out in the quiet on the wet streets, reflecting red and blue

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:50.360
Setting off to see while nothing old and nothing new From the east side to the west side, I'm moving in the calm Here are pieces I've been missing for so long

01:10:50.360 --> 01:11:08.860
Come in determination, I'm yours to command Come true intimidation, I'm yours to command

01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:24.860
Come in determination, I'm yours to command I'm yours to command

01:11:38.860 --> 01:12:03.860
Come true determination, I'm yours to command

01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:32.860
Come in determination, I'm yours to command Come true intimidation, I'm yours to command

01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:39.860
From DDR UltraMix IV, that is Rupesh Cartel with Yours to Command here on Orange Lounge Radio, the DDR Sneak Peaks.

01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:42.860
Kind of 80s reminiscent, that song. That's kind of cool.

01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:47.860
It'll probably have a pretty easy step chart, but that's okay. The noobs need something to play, and that's a good song, I think.

01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:55.860
Alright, we're going to go and do another song, and this song is from DDR Universe, and I have a feeling this might be a little bit of a controversial song,

01:12:55.860 --> 01:13:02.860
because they've taken an old Konami classic and really remixed the heck out of it, so it's interesting.

01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:09.860
Imagine your favorite gothic whipping game of all time with a big band swing sound.

01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:16.860
Yeah, I'm not even kidding. It's Castlevania, the freestyle and mix, wave group featuring Nicky G.

01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:20.860
See what you think. This is coming to DDR Universe here on the Orange Lounge Radio Sneak Peaks.

01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:27.860
This is coming to DDR Universe here on the Orange Lounge Radio Sneak Peaks.

01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:57.860
This is coming to DDR Universe.

01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:27.860
This is coming to DDR Universe.

01:14:50.860 --> 01:15:10.860
Castlevania, the freestyle and mix here on Orange Lounge Radio, DDR Sneak Peaks.

01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:14.860
Kind of interesting. I haven't heard anything quite like that before.

01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:20.860
I've heard plenty like it. I have the Saturn version of Symphony of the Night, or I should say Nocturne in the Moonlight,

01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:26.860
and if you play as Richter or Maria when you go into the lobby there of the castle,

01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:31.860
you actually get either Vampire Killer or I think Bloodlines, depending on who you play.

01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:36.860
I think Maria gets Vampire Killer, and it's sort of a similar mix to that.

01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:43.860
Also, that style of music has shown up in Dracula X on the PC Engine Duo.

01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:50.860
But you can't help but imagine Alucard in the shiny jacket getting down all BG style, right?

01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:53.860
This is nothing new from Konami.

01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:57.860
Interesting mixed reaction from the chat room there to that, though,

01:15:57.860 --> 01:15:59.860
because I bet a lot of people probably haven't heard that same thing you have,

01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:00.860
and some people in the chat room are kind of like...

01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:02.860
Bloody Tears, that was the other one.

01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:06.860
That's a little bit of a weird sound, but some other people are like, wow, I really dig that.

01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:10.860
It's like most DDR song lists. There's going to be some songs you love and some songs you don't like so much,

01:16:10.860 --> 01:16:11.860
but there's something for everyone.

01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:15.860
That was right, Maria gets Bloody Tears, and that was...

01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:17.860
I haven't played that game in like a year.

01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:21.860
Chat room is also yelling that we're not acknowledging Supernova that's coming out next week,

01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:25.860
and should I point out, Loki actually already mentioned it, hello, in his upcoming releases,

01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:28.860
but you guys already have heard the Supernova VR at this point.

01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:30.860
We don't have anything new for you regarding that,

01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:35.860
but we do have something new for you from DDR UltraMix 4, another track here.

01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:39.860
This is a song called Electric Air, and it's by an artist called Amit,

01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:42.860
and it's a simple four-letter name there, A-M-I-T, Amit,

01:16:42.860 --> 01:17:10.860
and it's called Electric Air here on the DDR Sneak Previews. Check it out, Orange Launch Radio.

01:17:42.860 --> 01:17:59.860
I see a rush in the shade, yeah

01:17:59.860 --> 01:18:28.860
That was Electric Air by Amit here on Orange Launch Radio, DDR Sneak Peaks.

01:18:28.860 --> 01:18:33.860
One more song for you guys tonight, and if you guys played DDR UltraMix 2,

01:18:33.860 --> 01:18:38.860
or heck, if you've played some of those import mixes from Japan of BeatMania 2DX,

01:18:38.860 --> 01:18:43.860
then you might know a little song called Toe Jam that was a very interesting little song,

01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:46.860
kind of a little bit of country hoedown by Big Idea.

01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:52.860
Well, guess what? Big Idea is back in DDR universe, and so is Toe Jam.

01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:56.860
This is our last song tonight. It's Big Idea with Return of the Toe Jam

01:18:56.860 --> 01:18:59.860
here on the Orange Launch Radio Sneak Peaks.

01:19:56.860 --> 01:20:06.860
Big Idea with Return of the Toe Jam

01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:46.860
Return of the Toe Jam by Big Idea coming soon to DDR universe.

01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:48.860
That was cool.

01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:57.860
I expect Minnie Pearl to come out towards the end of that song and go, hi!

01:20:57.860 --> 01:21:03.860
It's interesting, I think a lot of the songs we've played tonight kind of have this common theme

01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:08.860
where some people probably really liked it and some people didn't like it so much,

01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:13.860
but hopefully there was one of those four, at least if not three, that you really dug.

01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:19.860
Me personally, I kind of dug them all. Trust me, if I thought one of them sucked, I'd tell you,

01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:23.860
but I think they're all pretty cool, so the game should be interesting.

01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:30.860
I have actually done square dancing when I was younger, much younger.

01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:33.860
Now that's what Konami needs, square dance revolution.

01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:35.860
Square dancing is actually kind of fun.

01:21:35.860 --> 01:21:38.860
You know what? I used to look forward to that in P.E.,

01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:41.860
because it was like, hey, we were in the gym for two weeks.

01:21:41.860 --> 01:21:47.860
DJ Tyrant said that song delivers. I wonder if he means deliverance.

01:21:47.860 --> 01:21:49.860
Yeah, real pretty ass.

01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:54.860
Yeah, when the DDR announcer tells me to squeal like a pig, that's when I'm going to stop playing.

01:21:54.860 --> 01:21:57.860
I actually haven't square danced since I was in fourth grade, by the way.

01:21:57.860 --> 01:21:59.860
Really? We did it in high school.

01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:03.860
Konami, are you listening? Square dance revolution, make it happen, come on.

01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:06.860
They gave us karaoke revolution country.

01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:08.860
Karaoke revolution country sold, didn't it?

01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:11.860
We had it at E3, though, so I could sing Good Old Boys.

01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:12.860
Oh, give me a break.

01:22:12.860 --> 01:22:15.860
To get my Dukes of Hazzard on.

01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:19.860
I think I played it at Konami Gamers' Day and there was some Shania song.

01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:21.860
I sung it, I think. I can't remember.

01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:23.860
Shania is awesome.

01:22:23.860 --> 01:22:25.860
Do I even know you two anymore?

01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:26.860
Apparently.

01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:28.860
Dude, line dancing revolution. See, there's a difference.

01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:36.860
Line dancing is kind of like stupid cheerleading para para, but square dancing is kind of cool.

01:22:36.860 --> 01:22:40.860
Alright, we need to go take a break so we can reminisce some more.

01:22:40.860 --> 01:23:06.860
So that's going to do it for our part A, but we'll be back in a little bit with part B of our podcast.
