00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 198 for this September 3, 2006.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.580
If you're listening to us on the podcast feed, remember that Orange Lounge Radio is distributed

00:30.580 --> 00:31.580
in two parts.

00:31.580 --> 00:36.000
Part A rolls out Monday morning and Part B rolls out somewhere between Tuesday and Wednesday

00:36.000 --> 00:38.160
whenever we feel like it.

00:38.160 --> 00:41.640
You have to go back and listen to Part A to really get the full experience of what's going

00:41.640 --> 00:42.640
on tonight.

00:42.640 --> 00:47.320
What is going on tonight is that Loki and I have been partaking in a little bit of alcohol

00:47.320 --> 00:50.600
because it's a three-day weekend, but please drink responsibly.

00:50.600 --> 00:53.560
Do not follow our example unless you are responsible like we are.

00:53.560 --> 00:59.640
We have Mikl Tov here, who's completely sober, our special guest tonight, babysitting us.

00:59.640 --> 01:03.620
So go back to part A and catch up on your Orange Lounge radio, and for now, we'll get

01:03.620 --> 01:08.640
back into the gaming news on this part B. Loki, start it off.

01:08.640 --> 01:15.960
Okay, anyways, to start things off, like I said in part A, I've been playing some Saints

01:15.960 --> 01:19.840
Row, and got some good news, there's new download content coming soon.

01:19.840 --> 01:24.760
Now this content I'm not sure if it's going to be downloadable through live or through

01:24.760 --> 01:29.700
like kiosks because if you remember correctly and this really hasn't been advertised too

01:29.700 --> 01:34.540
much but the demo kiosks that are in like you know your best buys and your game stops

01:34.540 --> 01:39.680
and whatnot they actually do have content you can download off of there onto a memory

01:39.680 --> 01:45.120
you know card so if you do happen to have you know one of the memory units for the 360

01:45.120 --> 01:49.320
you might be able to get some good stuff including some brand new outfits and clothing for your

01:49.320 --> 01:55.440
Saints Row characters, including such wacky things like a samurai helmet, a leather eyepatch,

01:55.440 --> 02:02.440
a fake tuxedo t-shirt, which is awesome, some tropical shirt. Can you get a Moomoo like

02:02.440 --> 02:07.440
you can in Dead Rising, because that is the best costume ever. Possibly, but not yet at

02:07.440 --> 02:14.120
least. You can get a spiked leather jacket. Who made Saints Row, THQ? Dear THQ, Moomoo,

02:14.120 --> 02:21.360
Please, thanks, love Skye, orange lounge. Anywho, you've also got leopard slash tiger

02:21.360 --> 02:30.860
skin boxers, leather chaps, crazy bunny slippers, a skull ring, a saints row medallion and saints

02:30.860 --> 02:36.340
row wristband, as well as some tattoos, they have a large and small panther, rattlesnake,

02:36.340 --> 02:41.300
biohazard sign, an unk, and a spider.

02:41.300 --> 02:46.500
So that's pretty sweet and apparently you can get it pretty soon.

02:46.500 --> 02:50.540
They've already got some screenshots of these things, including someone who's wearing all

02:50.540 --> 02:53.580
of them at the same time and he looks like a freak.

02:53.580 --> 02:54.580
Awesome.

02:54.580 --> 02:59.180
Now of course some folks are noticing the Saints Row has a few problems with it.

02:59.180 --> 03:02.660
Now Volition, one of the developers of the game there, they are aware of the problems

03:02.660 --> 03:05.220
and they are working on a patch right now.

03:05.220 --> 03:07.380
These are things that are supposed to be in the patch.

03:07.380 --> 03:12.320
Improvements to the way the game handles packet loss and bandwidth management between players.

03:12.320 --> 03:17.380
This will address lag and general synchronization problems between the player's clients and

03:17.380 --> 03:18.420
so on.

03:18.420 --> 03:23.260
The system for rating a player's quality of service has been improved and made less conservative.

03:23.260 --> 03:26.780
This means you'll see many more matches with 10-12 player limits.

03:26.780 --> 03:31.820
Fix for the closed stealing exploit in multiplayer, fix for widescreen formatting issues and certain

03:31.820 --> 03:34.860
resolutions and changes to the matchmaking phase.

03:34.860 --> 03:37.360
to get players in the game faster.

03:37.360 --> 03:38.200
Yeah, it is kind of.

03:38.200 --> 03:39.020
Kind of like that first,

03:39.020 --> 03:40.760
you remember that first Halo 2 patch did a lot of that.

03:40.760 --> 03:44.300
That's good, because I know the multiplayer

03:44.300 --> 03:46.300
as it is right now, at least the game I played

03:46.300 --> 03:48.240
was pretty unplayable, so.

03:48.240 --> 03:50.280
You know on my friends list on Xbox Live,

03:50.280 --> 03:53.120
Saints Row is easily the most popular game right now.

03:53.120 --> 03:55.440
Nobody ever plays Final Fantasy XI on my friends list.

03:55.440 --> 03:57.720
I've seen maybe one other person playing Enchanted Arms.

03:57.720 --> 03:58.560
And you know what?

03:58.560 --> 03:59.400
What?

03:59.400 --> 04:01.200
And we do have a gang on Saints Row.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.260
The O.L. Army is there.

04:03.260 --> 04:06.900
and um... all you need to do it's pretty simple

04:06.900 --> 04:09.860
let me know if you've got the game you know send an invite if you're not a

04:09.860 --> 04:12.460
friend of uh... loki oler already

04:12.460 --> 04:16.460
um... and basically what i'll do is i'll send an invite to join the gang and i've

04:16.460 --> 04:17.320
done that already

04:17.320 --> 04:20.580
even with people there's a thread in our forums right at orange I'll show you there's a

04:20.580 --> 04:24.220
thread but even even people like i see em playing saints row i'll send em an

04:24.220 --> 04:26.900
invite i'll jump in the game real quick and send an invite

04:26.900 --> 04:29.140
so

04:29.140 --> 04:32.540
try that out i mean i'm just trying to get some people to join up

04:32.540 --> 04:37.120
Obviously, we're not really going all hardcore at this but you know, I think later on down the line

04:37.120 --> 04:42.100
It'd be fun to do a multiplayer game, you know, maybe deathmatch versus everyone be kind of fun. So I

04:42.620 --> 04:47.560
Don't know something to think about fun game though multiplayer. Yeah, I'm curious to get out. I notice other

04:48.180 --> 04:51.900
Podcasters on my friends list are playing the hell out of this game like gamer Andy

04:51.900 --> 04:53.900
I don't think I've seen playing anything else but this

04:54.620 --> 04:57.620
God-free from gamertag has been playing a crap load of Saints Row

04:57.620 --> 05:02.800
So I think we need to form a gang and take some of those guys on in a multi podcast tournament

05:02.800 --> 05:04.800
Hopefully it will work this time. I'm like a

05:06.080 --> 05:07.840
This is my only

05:07.840 --> 05:12.560
Stimulation no teams if it is gonna be something I want to be like an all-out grudge match

05:12.600 --> 05:17.080
You know, like, you know eight people on eight people eight people against each other, you know

05:17.080 --> 05:22.360
So you can have a couple people from each podcast, but everyone for themselves. All right, we'll see what happens. We'll see what happens

05:23.320 --> 05:24.960
so now

05:24.960 --> 05:29.620
We're gonna get into some release dates. Yes Loki if you don't have Saints Row yet

05:29.620 --> 05:34.860
There might be some other games you can get soon. There are some other games for the u.s. Lots of stuff actually coming out

05:35.460 --> 05:41.360
This week, of course, if you're a NASCAR fan, you can look forward to it on the PlayStation 2 Xbox and the PSP

05:42.360 --> 05:45.520
Also on those systems. Well, not the PSP

05:45.520 --> 05:51.480
But you're gonna be getting spy hunter know where to run which a kind of a classic remake of the old

05:51.480 --> 05:55.880
you know arcade shooter series also which is supposed to be coming out as a movie later

05:55.880 --> 05:56.880
on.

05:56.880 --> 06:02.160
For your 360 fan so Test Drive Unlimited is coming out as well as Xbox Live Arcade Unplugged

06:02.160 --> 06:06.520
Volume 1 will be also hitting the streets.

06:06.520 --> 06:13.320
Loco Roco is coming out on the PSP this week and Yakuza on the Playstation 2 is going to

06:13.320 --> 06:17.400
be coming out this week and those are going to be the big ones for this week.

06:17.400 --> 06:21.720
And also of course next week the big thing is probably going to be Lego Star Wars 2 as

06:21.720 --> 06:27.680
well as Rule of Rose, which I hopefully look forward to talking about soon.

06:27.680 --> 06:33.200
And yeah, that's pretty much it.

06:33.200 --> 06:35.160
Did you have news about price drops too?

06:35.160 --> 06:37.520
Ah yes, I did.

06:37.520 --> 06:40.440
Lots of fun stuff getting price drops.

06:40.440 --> 06:50.960
The D3 announced this week that Naruto, the Gameboy Advance game Ninja Council, is going

06:50.960 --> 06:54.360
to be added to the player choice lineup as well as-

06:54.360 --> 06:58.320
And they will pay you $5 to play their game!

06:58.320 --> 06:59.320
Hey!

06:59.320 --> 07:00.320
That game wasn't that bad.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.320
I'm just teasing.

07:01.320 --> 07:02.320
I'm teasing.

07:02.320 --> 07:03.320
I don't think.

07:03.320 --> 07:04.320
I mean, sheesh.

07:04.320 --> 07:12.760
were getting added to that as well as the GameCube version, Naruto, I want to say, no

07:12.760 --> 07:18.080
it wasn't Ultimate Ninja, whatever, the GameCube one, I don't play the GameCube that much anymore.

07:18.080 --> 07:24.200
But if you have like a 360 and you may not have joined up in Vanadil yet, Final Fantasy

07:24.200 --> 07:29.240
11 is going to be dropped to $29.99, which is pretty awesome.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.640
Come to the dark side.

07:31.640 --> 07:32.640
And then if you have...

07:32.640 --> 07:39.000
And if you really can't wait for some FIFA action, FIFA World Cup 06 for the 360 is dropped

07:39.000 --> 07:45.280
down to $39.99 as well, FIFA 07 of course coming out in October, so not too far off,

07:45.280 --> 07:47.960
but you still got to wait.

07:47.960 --> 07:52.640
Now Dark Sakura does have the night off because of her anniversary and that doesn't mean though

07:52.640 --> 07:56.480
that we're going to neglect our fans over in the UK, we're going to show you a little

07:56.480 --> 08:00.240
love with some of the release dates that you guys are getting in the very near future.

08:00.240 --> 08:04.380
Dead Rising is coming out on the 8th finally for you guys, with some better box art I think

08:04.380 --> 08:05.380
than what we got here.

08:05.380 --> 08:06.380
See the new box art?

08:06.380 --> 08:07.380
It's slightly better, yeah.

08:07.380 --> 08:08.380
It's kinda hot, I like it.

08:08.380 --> 08:11.560
So, maybe it was worth the wait, okay, probably not.

08:11.560 --> 08:16.760
The only thing I don't like about the box art, no representation for the Servbot head.

08:16.760 --> 08:17.760
That's true, that's true.

08:17.760 --> 08:20.980
But the game is pretty hot, so you guys in Europe have been waiting long enough for it,

08:20.980 --> 08:22.420
so you finally get it on the 8th.

08:22.420 --> 08:25.620
Enchanted Arms is also coming out for you guys on the 8th.

08:25.620 --> 08:28.860
Also coming out for you guys, Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins on the PSP.

08:28.860 --> 08:35.040
I forgot that was also coming out this week here if you're a PC gamer you have two games coming out secret files a

08:35.280 --> 08:42.360
Tunguska and warfront turning point looking ahead to the week of the 15th on the PC call of Juarez faces of war

08:42.840 --> 08:47.360
Gtr2 broken sword the angel of death, but if you're a little bit more of a console gamer

08:47.360 --> 08:52.560
you do have Yakuza and NASCAR o7 to look forward to on the PlayStation 2 and

08:53.000 --> 08:56.260
Should be pointed out calendared right now for September 16th

08:56.260 --> 09:02.040
Mikotov you like this UK finally getting Suikoden 5 I don't care about

09:02.040 --> 09:08.300
them so wow you're polite yeah did you like Suikoden 5 is it a good game in the

09:08.300 --> 09:13.900
series I think so but I helped write it so which means we have to make double

09:13.900 --> 09:18.860
fun of it yay I wish we could get the original Japanese version instead

09:18.860 --> 09:22.320
because the English version sucks.

09:22.320 --> 09:23.320
Nobody heard you.

09:23.320 --> 09:24.320
Just kidding.

09:24.320 --> 09:31.860
Anywho, speaking of things that suck and happen to be from Konami.

09:31.860 --> 09:32.860
Is it Bomberman?

09:32.860 --> 09:33.860
No!

09:33.860 --> 09:34.860
A Bomberman Zero?

09:34.860 --> 09:45.640
Actually, Konami has licensed Frogger to be made into a little portable gaming device.

09:45.640 --> 09:48.680
This device is going to be kind of like a tablet system.

09:48.680 --> 09:54.660
It's going to feature 25 8-bit games, including Frogger, as well as some forgotten titles

09:54.660 --> 10:02.640
like Vitamania, Funny Fungi, Stuntman, and Daredevil, or Stuntman and Daredevil, that's

10:02.640 --> 10:03.640
okay.

10:03.640 --> 10:05.640
I haven't heard those.

10:05.640 --> 10:14.880
Anyways, it's got a 2-inch backlit TFT LCD display screen as well as some fun little

10:14.880 --> 10:20.360
white shell for it that's also lime green magenta and orange and we'll be able to be

10:20.360 --> 10:24.360
hooked up to your TV kind of like a plug and play type of thing. It's supposed to retail

10:24.360 --> 10:30.520
oh and by the way it does not come with the plug and play hookup kit that is another ten

10:30.520 --> 10:38.680
dollars but the tablet itself will be $29.99. Okay, seriously Kami, I really love you guys.

10:38.680 --> 10:47.960
I mean seriously, Castlevania, DDR, Contra, Silent Hill, Gods among games, even Suikoden

10:47.960 --> 10:51.560
is not that bad, gods among games.

10:51.560 --> 10:55.520
But seriously Konami, get over Frogger.

10:55.520 --> 10:58.880
Let the damn frog drown and be done with it.

10:58.880 --> 11:04.760
Oh by the way, put those resources towards something else, I beg of you, please.

11:04.760 --> 11:06.400
That is what the device looks like by the way.

11:06.400 --> 11:09.500
It looks like poop.

11:09.500 --> 11:13.300
It looks like a cheap knockoff of the Game Boy Advance.

11:13.300 --> 11:16.460
It looks like kind of like a Wonder Swan in a weird way.

11:16.460 --> 11:17.460
I don't know, to me.

11:17.460 --> 11:19.580
Maybe it's just the button layout kind of reminds me of Wonder Swan.

11:19.580 --> 11:20.580
I don't know.

11:20.580 --> 11:21.580
And you?

11:21.580 --> 11:22.580
Perhaps I'm crazy.

11:22.580 --> 11:23.580
You know who you can really blame for this?

11:23.580 --> 11:24.580
Pelican.

11:24.580 --> 11:25.580
Because they're the one putting it out.

11:25.580 --> 11:26.580
Yay.

11:26.580 --> 11:27.580
Fun, fun.

11:27.580 --> 11:28.580
Hooray, hooray.

11:28.580 --> 11:33.380
Okay, look, moving on to other games.

11:33.380 --> 11:35.420
I'm trying to see if there's any feedback in our chat room.

11:35.420 --> 11:41.560
I don't see a hole looks like they're gonna have bus to move on it Darcy. Well, that's Oh burger time burger time

11:41.560 --> 11:46.820
Hey now, I'm a little I'm a little more satisfied. I dark Tetsuya says every effing Frogger game. He can't swim

11:46.820 --> 11:48.820
He's a frog for crying out loud

11:48.980 --> 11:54.060
Good point Jeremy Todd one says let the fog get run over by a semi already. That's our chat room

11:54.580 --> 11:56.580
www.orangeonsready.com click on chat

11:57.060 --> 12:02.700
Hmm interesting. I'm so excited about this port to the DS or at least I was when I first read about it

12:02.700 --> 12:08.600
And then I was a little bit disappointed okay one of the most underlooked Super Nintendo games of all time that was so great was

12:08.600 --> 12:11.340
Sim City on the Super Nintendo, and yes

12:11.340 --> 12:14.840
I know it was a PC game to begin with and the PC game was awesome, too

12:15.020 --> 12:17.220
But the Super Nintendo version kind of added

12:17.220 --> 12:22.100
You know the cuteness factor to it that made the game very cool although my favorite version of this game will always be

12:22.600 --> 12:29.060
The one that was on CD-ROM for Sim City that had the really cheesy news segments in full motion video that was inserted into the

12:29.060 --> 12:33.740
mill of it I was the best thing ever well anyway SimCity is coming to the DS

12:33.740 --> 12:37.620
SimCity is coming through Electronic Arts and it's featured in the latest

12:37.620 --> 12:42.220
issue of Famicu magazine so I read that and I said fuck yes it's gonna be

12:42.220 --> 12:47.780
SimCity on the DS except then I read this it's based on SimCity 3000 and then

12:47.780 --> 12:51.140
I went no

12:51.900 --> 12:58.180
cuz I hate SimCity 3000 like nothing will never be as good as the original

12:58.180 --> 13:03.740
for me but if you like before it's really fun if you like SimCity 3000

13:03.740 --> 13:07.620
then maybe you'll get a kick out of the SimCity DS it's got three main modes of

13:07.620 --> 13:12.620
play build the city save the city and sister city sister city mode lets you

13:12.620 --> 13:16.460
chat with other players and trade landmarks so that's kind of cool so

13:16.460 --> 13:23.820
something to look forward to DS fans anyways one good thing for Nintendo is

13:23.820 --> 13:27.020
is Tecmo is supporting the Wii's virtual console aggressively.

13:27.020 --> 13:31.140
And what does this mean? Well it probably means that you're going to be able to play

13:31.140 --> 13:34.940
such wonderful games like Tecmo Bowl and stuff like that.

13:34.940 --> 13:38.580
They have not said exactly which games are going to be supported on there

13:38.580 --> 13:41.900
but it is going to be coming with lots of stuff so

13:41.900 --> 13:46.140
that's great. I like to see that they're supporting it and maybe we'll get some

13:46.140 --> 13:50.940
Ninja Gaiden stuff as well.

13:50.940 --> 13:56.940
Very cool. Now I'll go to a story about the Wii, talking about the Wiimote.

13:56.940 --> 14:01.940
Basically what's going on, there could be some production issues going on right now.

14:01.940 --> 14:05.940
Go Nintendo picked up a story that was going on about the Nintendo Wii,

14:05.940 --> 14:08.940
and there's a quote here on what's going on with the Wii production.

14:08.940 --> 14:12.940
Quote, the factory has received Wii controller's purchasing order in its sample,

14:12.940 --> 14:15.940
but it's still stuck in testing phase.

14:15.940 --> 14:19.940
From feedbacks of testers, currently the Wiimote and Nunchuck still have a lot of small issues.

14:19.940 --> 14:23.940
small issues, such as the buttons not being sensitive, it's hard to press two buttons

14:23.940 --> 14:29.260
together, and no response occasionally. Uh oh, could this be a bad sign for the Wii?

14:29.260 --> 14:32.740
I don't know, the thing felt fine to me at E3. I don't know what this thing's talking

14:32.740 --> 14:35.460
about, but whatever. Exactly, I mean, come on, they've already

14:35.460 --> 14:39.700
produced some already. I don't see why, in all, it didn't seem that hard to play with

14:39.700 --> 14:42.620
at E3. Yeah.

14:42.620 --> 14:45.660
I mean, if this is in full production, unless they fucked up something in the production

14:45.660 --> 14:46.380
line you know

14:46.380 --> 14:49.380
I don't see why it wouldn't be

14:49.380 --> 14:52.500
I don't believe it to be honest because I mean those things aren't that complex

14:52.500 --> 14:53.780
it's a fucking controller mean

14:53.780 --> 14:58.220
they built tons of controllers for a while now I it's not that different from

14:58.220 --> 15:02.900
like button pushing why I I'm thinking it's a minor issue that's blowing up

15:02.900 --> 15:03.900
into something major

15:03.900 --> 15:07.780
so good I mean if you think about it they've been making console controllers

15:07.780 --> 15:09.120
for a long time now

15:09.120 --> 15:13.060
and that my drinks empty so they put out a problem that is a very big problem

15:13.060 --> 15:17.060
but this is a much worse than Nintendo not being able to make new controllers

15:17.060 --> 15:20.260
my drink is empty this is a problem that must be remedied immediately

15:20.260 --> 15:24.060
anyways I don't think it's a big deal because if you think about it they've

15:24.060 --> 15:26.060
been making console controllers for a long time

15:26.060 --> 15:29.420
and they should be able to get it right so whatever

15:29.420 --> 15:32.940
alright well we are going to go to the skype line right now because I notice

15:32.940 --> 15:35.860
we're getting a call in right now on the skype line I definitely want to take this

15:35.860 --> 15:36.460
call

15:36.460 --> 15:40.180
Orange Launch Radio are you there? I am

15:40.180 --> 15:45.020
sort of. Oh, is that Jamie? Yes it is. Hi Jamie, how are you?

15:45.020 --> 15:48.260
I'm doing okay. It's been a very

15:48.260 --> 15:52.500
busy day. Yeah? What kind of stuff have you been doing to celebrate your anniversary? Happy anniversary

15:52.500 --> 15:55.020
by the way from all of us at Orange Launch Radio and our chat room and all that.

15:55.020 --> 15:58.620
Thank you. Well, on Friday I came home and there were

15:58.620 --> 16:02.060
roses waiting for me, which made me all happy.

16:02.060 --> 16:06.660
You know, I am a girl. I like girl things sometimes. Right.

16:06.660 --> 16:09.520
and we went out to eat at this place called Fats,

16:09.520 --> 16:11.840
which was me actually after we ate, so.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.560
But no, it's this place in Roseville

16:13.560 --> 16:15.480
that's like a expensive Chinese place.

16:16.720 --> 16:18.640
You know what, I'm looking in our chatroom right now,

16:18.640 --> 16:20.660
orangeonshoot.com, and then the chatroom is going,

16:20.660 --> 16:23.640
oh shit, it's Dark Sakura, get in the car, hide!

16:23.640 --> 16:25.620
They've been doing snakes on a plane jokes all night long,

16:25.620 --> 16:27.160
they know they're in trouble.

16:27.160 --> 16:29.400
Actually, one of the people I met at Disneyland,

16:29.400 --> 16:32.600
who was also somebody I've been watching on DeviantArt,

16:32.600 --> 16:35.440
she worked at Disneyland until just recently

16:35.440 --> 16:39.120
was going around putting those, uh, plushie snakes on different characters' heads.

16:39.120 --> 16:46.760
It's funny, she did, like, snakes on a hatter, and did movie files of the Mad Hatter and Alice playing with snakes.

16:46.760 --> 16:50.240
You know, it's been about, what, two weeks since you've been to Disneyland and you still haven't stopped talking about it?

16:50.240 --> 16:55.400
I love Disneyland. No, I know, it's great. Hey, how was your gaming week? What kind of games have you been playing this week?

16:55.400 --> 16:59.480
Actually, I just got done playing a game, the newest addition to the pinball collection.

16:59.480 --> 17:03.200
Uh-oh, what'd you guys get? Star Trek The Next Generation pinball.

17:03.200 --> 17:06.080
Dude, that's awesome! That's a great pinball table.

17:06.080 --> 17:10.760
It is, and the thing about it, Dan got it for pretty much, you know, a steal, you know,

17:10.760 --> 17:15.040
given that the machines go for, what, three, four thousand dollars? He's in the bathroom.

17:15.040 --> 17:19.480
Yeah, don't take him to the bathroom. Don't take the phone to the bathroom, please.

17:19.480 --> 17:21.280
No, but

17:21.280 --> 17:25.080
we got it for a pretty good price, and it needs a lot of work to it, but it came with

17:25.080 --> 17:31.240
like a bunch of extra ramps and stuff, and Dan's gonna put some work into it. I actually went ahead and played it, but we had the glass off.

17:31.240 --> 17:36.240
Oh my God, pinball machines are loud when they have no glass on them, so we were cheating and hitting the targets.

17:37.240 --> 17:39.240
That is a little bit of cheating. That's cool though.

17:40.240 --> 17:43.240
We were like throwing the ball at the Delta Quadrant ramp and everything. It was really cool.

17:44.240 --> 17:45.240
Did you play any console games at all?

17:46.240 --> 17:51.240
I have enchanted arms. I haven't actually played it yet because I've been sort of busy with the whole anniversary thing.

17:52.240 --> 17:53.240
And I played some Super Mario Brothers.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.240
You need to play it before the next show because I want to know what you think of Makoto.

17:57.240 --> 17:58.240
Okay, I will play it.

17:58.240 --> 17:59.360
OK, I will play it.

17:59.360 --> 18:01.200
There's a gay guy in it.

18:01.200 --> 18:01.920
Great.

18:01.920 --> 18:03.000
Yeah, it's interesting.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.440
That's all I have to say.

18:04.440 --> 18:06.080
You know, that makes my inner hag happy.

18:06.080 --> 18:07.280
What, you've been playing Super Mario Brothers?

18:07.280 --> 18:09.800
Like, the new Super Mario Brothers or the old one?

18:09.800 --> 18:11.040
I got one for free.

18:11.040 --> 18:11.920
Oh, cool.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.520
Very cool.

18:13.520 --> 18:14.880
I've been giving it some play.

18:14.880 --> 18:16.520
Did you have any, like, news you wanted

18:16.520 --> 18:21.120
to share with the listeners tonight since you're not here?

18:21.120 --> 18:21.840
No.

18:21.840 --> 18:25.080
OK, I did release dates for you, and we did mailbag.

18:25.080 --> 18:26.160
OK, cool.

18:26.160 --> 18:31.520
I actually, I've been conversing with a few of our listeners being, I've been sort of,

18:31.520 --> 18:36.240
I looked into the box, I'd be honest, I thought that since you would check it for me, I was

18:36.240 --> 18:39.100
like, oh, I'll handle that tonight.

18:39.100 --> 18:40.920
It's all good.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.640
Have fun with your weekend off and all that fun stuff.

18:43.640 --> 18:46.440
I will be there next weekend with a vengeance.

18:46.440 --> 18:48.000
199, can you believe it?

18:48.000 --> 18:49.920
We're almost at episode 200, it's crazy.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.040
Oh wow, that's next week, isn't it?

18:52.040 --> 18:53.040
I know.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.600
Well no, 199 is next week, and then 200.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.120
That's the same, 199 is next week.

18:56.120 --> 19:01.120
Craziness. Anything else you want to share with the listeners, DarkSakura?

19:01.120 --> 19:04.120
Yeah, give me dollars.

19:04.120 --> 19:05.120
Alright.

19:05.120 --> 19:07.120
Put it in the DarkSakura's next anniversary fund.

19:07.120 --> 19:10.120
Alright, you can send those dollars to mailbag at orangehonestradio.com.

19:10.120 --> 19:11.120
Sound good?

19:11.120 --> 19:12.120
Virtual dollars.

19:12.120 --> 19:15.120
Alright. Yeah, you can draw pictures of dollars. That'd be awesome.

19:15.120 --> 19:19.120
Okay. Yeah, okay. New Photoshop contest. Best dollar wins.

19:19.120 --> 19:25.120
Actually, I think they're doing a Photoshop contest right now on orangehonestradio.com of best orange honest radio fake news.

19:25.120 --> 19:30.280
It's pretty funny. I've been looking at that. It was pretty hilarious. I like the first one. Yeah, it's pretty awesome

19:30.280 --> 19:33.840
It's all done like the old death cake logo. It's great

19:34.480 --> 19:41.220
All right, I guess that's it for now Dark Sakura. We'll see you next week. Yep. Definitely. All right. Take care

19:41.220 --> 19:44.640
Thanks for calling in. The other people will hear me. All right, that works

19:45.480 --> 19:48.580
By the way, oh, I have to say wait. We've been drinking tonight

19:49.680 --> 19:54.520
Do you condone this action? I fully do. I was drinking the other night. Awesome

19:54.520 --> 20:00.400
I'm gonna be drinking tonight. All right, sounds good. Have fun, but not too much. And by the way, I need to talk to you later.

20:01.080 --> 20:03.080
Okay, you know where to find me.

20:03.720 --> 20:05.720
Okay, bye.

20:06.640 --> 20:08.640
I like those, you know,

20:09.800 --> 20:13.200
totally personal messages in the middle of the show. No, that's fine. It was funny.

20:14.240 --> 20:21.880
Nellie was talking about how she wanted to bring you Long Island iced tea because the last, or she remembered that one time that you're at the old

20:21.880 --> 20:27.120
apartment and you were trying to run up the wall because you have Long Island I

20:27.120 --> 20:34.880
see yeah I remember that it was a little bit crazy all right anyways some

20:34.880 --> 20:38.680
interesting stuff I'm speaking about kind of running and flailing and stuff

20:38.680 --> 20:44.120
like that they're looking for testers for the Wii and you're gonna be doing a

20:44.120 --> 20:49.400
lot of flailing apparently there's some article posted on MTV news and I'm sure

20:49.400 --> 20:57.240
they're the great source of gaming news. But anyways, saying that they're going into more

20:57.240 --> 21:00.940
of the process of creating and testing the games, and some of the gestures for example

21:00.940 --> 21:07.800
for Marvel Ultimate Alliance, that they brought down, you're actually doing a lot of flinging

21:07.800 --> 21:12.540
about in order to perform some of the moves, because only the buttons they're using for

21:12.540 --> 21:17.040
like A to jump and stuff like that, but still you gotta do a lot of gestures in order to

21:17.040 --> 21:22.800
actually be doing attacks and whatnot. And that includes a lot of arm flailing and stuff

21:22.800 --> 21:25.840
like that. Which should be interesting because I can't imagine playing that four player,

21:25.840 --> 21:31.660
staying next to your buddy or whatever and swinging your arms around. But the game initially

21:31.660 --> 21:37.840
started out with like apparently 20 gestures, but they simplified it down to five. So players

21:37.840 --> 21:43.660
are going to be constantly shooting, webbing, and tossing Captain America shields and stuff

21:43.660 --> 21:47.580
like that so, pretty interesting.

21:47.580 --> 21:54.180
Alright, moving on, now the Wii is all the rage right now and folks can't wait to get

21:54.180 --> 21:57.060
their hands on that and I'm sure a lot of folks will be wanting to play test it just

21:57.060 --> 22:01.040
to be able to say they played it early, but one thing nobody seems to want to play is

22:01.040 --> 22:07.020
the Game Boy Micro, at least in the UK, G-A-M-E or game I suppose, I'm not sure if it's an

22:07.020 --> 22:12.100
acronym for something but I guess you could just call it game for short, a UK retailer

22:12.100 --> 22:15.520
has sent the Game Boy Micros to the bargain bin.

22:15.520 --> 22:22.060
They used to be 69 pounds, now they're running for just 39 pounds, ouch.

22:22.060 --> 22:26.060
So if this is something that you've had your eye on but didn't want to get just yet, now

22:26.060 --> 22:29.620
might be a good time because they've come way down in price.

22:29.620 --> 22:31.380
So in the UK bargain bins anyway.

22:31.380 --> 22:37.120
By the way, 39 pounds is still about 75 US dollars, may not be worth it to import still

22:37.120 --> 22:40.420
because I think they're running a little cheaper than that here in America.

22:40.420 --> 22:47.620
Well, you know, people may not be, you know, lining up for the Game Boy Micro, but they

22:47.620 --> 22:53.740
are lining up for the black DS Lite in Japan, and apparently they haven't really released

22:53.740 --> 23:00.700
any numbers yet, but there's lines blocks long, so it should be interesting, probably

23:00.700 --> 23:06.980
another sellout for the DS Lite, and I know that there's new colors coming to Japan, actually

23:06.980 --> 23:08.620
pretty much all the regions here pretty soon.

23:08.620 --> 23:13.220
I know that weíre getting here in the US the black and pink DS lights which are going

23:13.220 --> 23:17.100
to be coming out I think on the 20th and then I know in the UK theyíre getting the pink

23:17.100 --> 23:22.340
one as well so it should be interesting with lots of different colors people seeing them

23:22.340 --> 23:24.220
eat up that stuff.

23:24.220 --> 23:27.180
Itís just another color.

23:27.180 --> 23:29.180
I donít understand why people are going nuts over this.

23:29.180 --> 23:31.340
No, I already have them pre-ordered my black DS light.

23:31.340 --> 23:34.060
Of course then again Iím going to get the pink one I think unless I have a change of

23:34.060 --> 23:37.380
heart but thatís just because I knew if I bought a white one they would come out with

23:37.380 --> 23:41.340
new color so I waited no no that's not what you're supposed to do you're

23:41.340 --> 23:45.580
supposed to go to eevee or GameStop buy the system when it comes out in the

23:45.580 --> 23:49.980
color you don't want get the replacement plan then when the color does come out

23:49.980 --> 23:54.980
that you want put down the money for the reservation take your old system that

23:54.980 --> 23:59.300
you didn't like back say didn't work then get your new color and then you

23:59.300 --> 24:02.640
still got money for your next replacement plan for the next color you

24:02.640 --> 24:07.240
want like I have I'm gonna get a blue and when it comes out or maybe I don't

24:07.240 --> 24:10.560
know what if those colors don't come out you're gonna be screwed off black that's

24:10.560 --> 24:16.080
better than the white one or just pick a color and stick with it all right we're

24:16.080 --> 24:20.080
gonna go to another segment now and it's a segment that's returning because it

24:20.080 --> 24:25.640

24:25.640 --> 24:30.320

25:20.060 --> 25:27.040
them mine. Oh, snap! Something on the line tonight. Is that really a prize, though? Because

25:27.040 --> 25:30.480
Because it's a Game Boy Micro.

25:30.480 --> 25:31.480
Alright.

25:31.480 --> 25:32.480
You know what?

25:32.480 --> 25:33.480
What?

25:33.480 --> 25:34.480
It's you, I'll keep it.

25:34.480 --> 25:35.480
Alright.

25:35.480 --> 25:36.480
Well then, you lose.

25:36.480 --> 25:40.760
The gauntlet has been thrown then, this is gonna be interesting tonight, okay, so some

25:40.760 --> 25:41.760
actual stuff.

25:41.760 --> 25:43.480
Okay, DMN, this is what we'll do.

25:43.480 --> 25:47.200
We will give you the same prize we gave the last guy, and you will get to help us with

25:47.200 --> 25:50.960
our Power Preview debuts, meaning you'll be the first in the world to know about some

25:50.960 --> 25:54.240
of these new tracks whenever we get to do them.

25:54.240 --> 25:55.240
Okay.

25:55.240 --> 25:56.240
Which hopefully should be soon.

25:56.240 --> 25:59.240
All right, so anyway, who do you want to challenge tonight and beat the host?

25:59.240 --> 26:03.240
Oh, first off, I don't even know if I need to ask because you work for Nintendo,

26:03.240 --> 26:06.240
but how would you say your knowledge of 8-bit video game music is?

26:06.240 --> 26:08.240
It's pretty decent.

26:08.240 --> 26:10.240
Pretty decent? All right, well, we'll see what happens.

26:10.240 --> 26:11.240
He works for Nintendo?

26:11.240 --> 26:13.240
Yeah, he does. You didn't know that?

26:13.240 --> 26:14.240
No, I didn't.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.240
It's because I came in late. Who do I have to choose from?

26:16.240 --> 26:19.240
All right, here's what you do. First, I have to boot you from the chat room

26:19.240 --> 26:22.240
because you cannot have their help tonight in this game, sorry.

26:22.240 --> 26:25.240
You can challenge either, and don't rejoin yet,

26:25.240 --> 26:31.000
You can challenge either Miklotov or Loki tonight.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.600
Let's do it, Loki.

26:32.600 --> 26:37.200
Alright, Loki is being challenged, so you know what that means, Loki?

26:37.200 --> 26:38.200
Get out!

26:38.200 --> 26:39.200
God dammit.

26:39.200 --> 26:43.760
Alright, while Loki is heading to the isolation room, I'm going to explain how Beat the Host

26:43.760 --> 26:44.760
works.

26:44.760 --> 26:50.040
We're going to play a clip that has ten, tonight it's old school 8-bit Nintendo songs streamed

26:50.040 --> 26:51.040
together in it.

26:51.040 --> 26:56.300
And at the very end of the clip you will have 30 seconds to name back as many of these 8-bit

26:56.300 --> 26:57.660
songs as you can.

26:57.660 --> 26:58.660
Sound good?

26:58.660 --> 26:59.660
Sounds like a plan.

26:59.660 --> 27:03.280
So you can write them down as you go, whatever you want to do, but you only get 30 seconds

27:03.280 --> 27:04.280
to name them back.

27:04.280 --> 27:05.280
Okay?

27:05.280 --> 27:06.280
All right.

27:06.280 --> 27:07.280
All right.

27:07.280 --> 27:08.280
Now Chat Room, you guys can play along.

27:08.280 --> 27:11.040
Omegletov, are you hurt that nobody ever picks you for this game?

27:11.040 --> 27:14.640
Well, they're stupid for not picking me because I'm really bad at this stuff.

27:14.640 --> 27:15.800
It's like an automatic win.

27:15.800 --> 27:20.240
Well, but you basically shat on the prize that DMN was going to give you, so I would

27:20.240 --> 27:25.240
No! You know what? I could have given him, I don't know, toenail clippings and it would have been just as good.

27:25.240 --> 27:29.240
You know what? If they came with a certificate of authenticity, I'll take them.

27:29.240 --> 27:30.240
Ew!

27:30.240 --> 27:32.240
That's kind of gross, but you're on.

27:32.240 --> 27:35.240
You might be able to get something like that from a DDR freak.

27:35.240 --> 27:36.240
Alright.

27:36.240 --> 27:37.240
Jesus.

27:37.240 --> 27:39.240
Here we go.

27:39.240 --> 27:41.240
Here it is. You ready, DMN?

27:41.240 --> 27:42.240
I'm ready.

27:42.240 --> 27:49.240
here is the clip

28:42.240 --> 29:03.500

29:54.040 --> 29:59.420

31:15.140 --> 31:32.460
Hey, shut up, we can hear you!

31:45.140 --> 32:01.460
Alright, Loki, you have 30 seconds to name them back.

32:01.460 --> 32:03.060
On your mark, get set, go!

32:03.060 --> 32:09.740
Friday the 13th, Tetris, yes, yes, Excitebike, yes, Bionic Commando, yes, Super Mario 2,

32:09.740 --> 32:13.100
yes, uhh, I wanna say Super C?

32:13.100 --> 32:14.100
No.

32:14.100 --> 32:15.100
Contra?

32:15.100 --> 32:22.060
Damn it. Um, fuck. I don't know. That's all I got. That's it. I'm sure you got 15. It's just randomly named games

32:26.660 --> 32:29.180
Shit I don't I can't think of anything then to be honest

32:29.180 --> 32:33.580
There's one I recognize but I can't remember it was all right time is up

32:34.580 --> 32:38.300
Let's tally it up Loki. You got five. That's a really good score

32:38.820 --> 32:44.260
And if DMN had been telling the truth about not getting any you would have beat him, but unfortunately DMN got six

32:44.260 --> 32:51.260
6! The host has been beaten!

33:14.260 --> 33:17.460
Or are you just going to beat up DMN because you don't like him?

33:17.460 --> 33:20.900
No, I don't hate him at all. I just want a free Wii.

33:20.900 --> 33:24.580
DMN, I have to know, did you have outside help? Because I heard you talking to somebody there.

33:24.580 --> 33:27.940
I had somebody remembering my

33:27.940 --> 33:31.660
guesses, but in all honesty, he did not give me any single answer.

33:31.660 --> 33:35.300
Alright, alright, fine, fair enough. Alright, I'm sure you guys want to know

33:35.300 --> 33:36.780
what the correct answers were.

33:36.780 --> 33:39.420
Chatroom did a really good job though, I think they got them all, but here they are for you

33:39.420 --> 33:41.420
guys listening on the podcast that were playing along.

33:41.420 --> 33:43.420
Did you beat the host tonight? Let's find out.

33:44.420 --> 33:46.420
Adventures of Lolo!

33:50.420 --> 33:52.420
Friday the 13th!

33:53.420 --> 33:57.420
One of my favorite sleeper hits. I don't care if that game got negative reviews, it's awesome.

33:57.420 --> 33:58.420
Tetris!

34:00.420 --> 34:01.420
That was an easy one.

34:06.420 --> 34:08.420
River City Ransom!

34:08.420 --> 34:10.420
God damn it.

34:10.420 --> 34:12.420
This is the one I thought was Contra.

34:12.420 --> 34:14.420
Oh, I would have thought it was the one coming up.

34:14.420 --> 34:16.420
I thought it was some sort of freaking Konami game.

34:16.420 --> 34:18.420
Excitebike!

34:20.420 --> 34:23.420
And that's like the only music in all of Excitebike is right there.

34:23.420 --> 34:25.420
Bionic Commando!

34:25.420 --> 34:27.420
I played this game so much that it was...

34:27.420 --> 34:30.420
That's the one that I completely forgot to say.

34:30.420 --> 34:32.420
I would have thought you'd know that one, Loki.

34:32.420 --> 34:34.420
I did! I put it that way.

34:34.420 --> 34:35.420
He got it, I didn't.

34:35.420 --> 34:36.420
Oh, sorry, my bad.

34:36.420 --> 34:39.940
Audius, of course.

34:39.940 --> 34:46.300
Dragon Warrior.

34:46.300 --> 34:49.380
I don't think either of you guys got this one. Double Dragon.

34:49.380 --> 34:51.660
God, I used to play that game so much.

34:51.660 --> 34:54.820
And lastly, you guys both got Super Mario Bros. 2.

34:54.820 --> 34:57.860
I'm turning in my resignation in Nintendo. That was pitiful.

34:57.860 --> 35:05.260
Oh no, you did fine. It's hard! Don't do that before you give me the free Wii that I'm going to beat you up for.

35:05.260 --> 35:08.800
no actually i'm thinking later on at some point

35:08.800 --> 35:12.160
during uh... the show we're gonna have like a uh... take-home

35:12.160 --> 35:16.120
beat the host type thing that the good that you guys will have like a week

35:16.120 --> 35:18.720
to send in the correct answers will give away something big like around

35:18.720 --> 35:22.240
christmas night but they're gonna be really fucking hard like really fucking

35:22.240 --> 35:24.960
obscure games

35:24.960 --> 35:27.880
so we'll see

35:27.880 --> 35:30.520
i didn't any proud of beating the host tonight

35:30.520 --> 35:37.240
I am seeing as like I jumped in the show about oh 20 minutes ago. Yeah. Hey, it works at listening live

35:37.240 --> 35:41.880
Any time it ends up working out anything else you want to share with our listeners before I hang up on you. Um

35:43.180 --> 35:49.060
Happy anniversary Jamie, and I'll see whoever's challenging me to Tetris in about 30 seconds

35:49.060 --> 35:52.920
All right, have fun with the chat room in Tetris. All right, take care later. Later

35:53.560 --> 35:58.660
That was fun. Mm-hmm. I will honor the chat rooms request next time we do beat the host

35:58.660 --> 36:04.820
I'm we will do something maybe Sega games. I know some folks want to challenge their Sega knowledge, especially against Jamie because

36:05.340 --> 36:07.340
that girl scary with her Sega knowledge and

36:07.980 --> 36:12.540
Maybe some other you know more current titles, so that'll probably last time we do 8-bit Nintendo for a little while

36:12.820 --> 36:17.620
So we'll see you need to do an all Mega Man one because there's so many different robot bosses

36:17.620 --> 36:19.980
And they all sound the same that might be one for the future

36:19.980 --> 36:24.660
We'll see are you saying that you would be willing if you can just name out guesses

36:24.660 --> 36:26.660
You can just go through all the Mega Man games

36:26.660 --> 36:30.380
Alright. Well maybe you'd have to actually like

36:30.380 --> 36:34.180
only guess one per song like have a like a sort of like a

36:34.180 --> 36:38.900
a list that you have to fill out. Alright let's get back into tonight's gaming

36:38.900 --> 36:39.860
news and

36:39.860 --> 36:43.000
speaking of music we did a lot of music there by the way I hope you guys enjoyed

36:43.000 --> 36:44.220
that segment if you didn't

36:44.220 --> 36:48.560
too bad. No, we always appreciate your feedback mailbag at orangeontraday.com

36:48.560 --> 36:53.780
Some new tracks were announced in the latest electronic gaming monthly

36:53.780 --> 36:56.920
or I guess they're called EGM for short now

36:56.920 --> 37:00.920
because I guess it's the cool thing to go by an acronym

37:00.920 --> 37:03.860
some new songs were announced for Guitar Hero 2

37:03.860 --> 37:07.760
Nirvana with Heart Shaped Box, Primus with John the Fisherman

37:07.760 --> 37:11.980
Stone Temple Pilots with Trippin' on a Hole in a Paper Heart

37:11.980 --> 37:16.120
Anthrax with Mout House, Motley Crue with Shout at the Devil

37:16.120 --> 37:19.260
The Police with Message in a Bottle

37:19.260 --> 37:23.260
The Pretenders with Tattooed Love Boys and get this Spinal Tap

37:23.260 --> 37:28.540
with tonight I'm gonna rock you tonight. That is so awesome that they got spinal

37:28.540 --> 37:29.460
tap in the game.

37:29.460 --> 37:33.220
Where's Queen? There was Black Hole Sun.

37:33.220 --> 37:37.540
You know, rumor is Black Hole Sun is there. There's some

37:37.540 --> 37:41.300
really weird rumor going around on the official Guitar Hero forums that

37:41.300 --> 37:41.900
involves

37:41.900 --> 37:45.180
like PlayStation 3 versions of the game and all this crazy shit.

37:45.180 --> 37:49.100
So I don't know. We'll see. I don't want to have to like this stupid game.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.660
Why do you hate Guitar Hero so much?

37:50.660 --> 37:51.660
It's not fun!

37:51.660 --> 37:52.660
You know what?

37:52.660 --> 37:54.240
I didn't have a good time with it every time I tried it.

37:54.240 --> 37:55.580
I'm with you, Shane.

37:55.580 --> 38:02.620
I'm like about this close to selling back my Guitar Hero and Guitar Hero controller.

38:02.620 --> 38:06.820
But I'm almost like seeing, okay maybe I should wait until this comes out.

38:06.820 --> 38:07.820
I don't know.

38:07.820 --> 38:11.280
Because I figure I'm going to have to buy another one anyways for the 360 if it comes

38:11.280 --> 38:13.700
out so I might as well.

38:13.700 --> 38:14.980
I don't know.

38:14.980 --> 38:18.760
just now they're getting what rush is pretty cool and getting stone temple

38:18.760 --> 38:24.120
pilots makes me happy and I we're running low on liquor so I'm running out

38:24.120 --> 38:30.880
boys and girls okie-dokie bye hey Mike let's talk about mashed potatoes again

38:30.880 --> 38:35.200
we can't talk about us yes dang it we have to talk about best buy and talk

38:35.200 --> 38:40.080
about bully and take about stupid people having too much time on their hands so

38:40.080 --> 38:45.480
So anyways, there's some oddly named protest group called the Pizzaholics that have staged

38:45.480 --> 38:58.480
a protest at a game, or at a Best Buy outside of New York City. And apparently, it's really

38:58.560 --> 39:02.680
weird. Apparently they're just protesting the game, you know, saying that Rockstar is

39:02.680 --> 39:08.600
worse than terrorists, and whatever. You know, I'm really tired of people, you know, protesting

39:08.600 --> 39:15.480
in a game that they don't even know what the premise of the game is, or just how you actually

39:15.480 --> 39:20.200
play the game and whether it actually rewards bullying, because to be honest, from what

39:20.200 --> 39:23.520
I've seen in the game, it doesn't look like you are the bully, it's kind of like you're

39:23.520 --> 39:25.640
being bullied, you know, that type of thing.

39:25.640 --> 39:30.880
I think it was something like you start out being bullied and then you become the bully

39:30.880 --> 39:31.880
later on.

39:31.880 --> 39:35.040
It doesn't matter because all they're protesting is that little image in the corner with the

39:35.040 --> 39:38.440
are in the star there for rockstar

39:38.440 --> 39:42.600
I'm just tired of people protesting crab... protest something else how about

39:42.600 --> 39:46.080
high gas prices or something I don't know

39:46.080 --> 39:50.000
but whatever they're protesting bully for now until the next Grand Theft Auto game

39:50.000 --> 39:55.800
High gas prices doesn't corrupt your kids though

39:55.800 --> 39:57.280
so yeah I don't know

39:57.280 --> 40:00.040
should be good

40:00.040 --> 40:04.320
hi sorry I was just kidding I brought you back more watermelon stuff

40:04.320 --> 40:05.320
What did you bring me back?

40:05.320 --> 40:07.460
Fuck, you didn't want more watermelon stuff, huh?

40:07.460 --> 40:08.460
I'm sorry.

40:08.460 --> 40:09.460
Whatever, I'm fine.

40:09.460 --> 40:10.460
Are you gonna drink it?

40:10.460 --> 40:12.220
I don't want it to go to waste, there's starving children throughout the world who might want

40:12.220 --> 40:13.220
that drink.

40:13.220 --> 40:16.220
Well, I'm not sure how much more I really want to drink.

40:16.220 --> 40:17.220
Do you want to try it?

40:17.220 --> 40:18.220
Do you want the screwdriver?

40:18.220 --> 40:19.220
No, I do not want the screwdriver.

40:19.220 --> 40:20.220
I feel bad.

40:20.220 --> 40:21.220
I will drink the watermelon stuff.

40:21.220 --> 40:26.480
It's just, that cup that you have it in was I think originally a candy dish, and it is

40:26.480 --> 40:27.480
like-

40:27.480 --> 40:28.480
It's been washed-

40:28.480 --> 40:29.480
I don't know how many times-

40:29.480 --> 40:31.180
I know it's been washed, but it's an oversized mug.

40:31.180 --> 40:33.380
It's like fucking huge, is what it is.

40:33.380 --> 40:36.700
fine drink get you big wimp are we cool

40:36.700 --> 40:39.620
am I up is my turn for a story it is

40:39.620 --> 40:41.620
your turn all right is it the bully name

40:41.620 --> 40:43.020
change you guys didn't do that yet no we

40:43.020 --> 40:44.580
have all right good then bullies getting

40:44.580 --> 40:46.060
a name change but only in other

40:46.060 --> 40:47.780
countries and you just talked about

40:47.780 --> 40:49.700
bully yes Loki yes I did and the

40:49.700 --> 40:51.780
protests and the house see the YouTube

40:51.780 --> 40:53.960
thing you know kind of weird it's so

40:53.960 --> 40:56.860
funny props to those guys who had the

40:56.860 --> 40:58.200
balls go down there and do that though

40:58.200 --> 41:00.900
props to you guys bully is no longer

41:00.900 --> 41:02.700
going to be called bully in Europe and

41:02.700 --> 41:04.540
This is according to Eurogamer.

41:04.540 --> 41:08.140
It's going to go to stores under the title Canis Canem Edit,

41:08.140 --> 41:10.980
which is Latin for dog eat dog.

41:10.980 --> 41:14.180
No reason said why they're going to change the title,

41:14.180 --> 41:16.700
but maybe because Rockstar is a little bit afraid

41:16.700 --> 41:17.820
of all the controversy.

41:17.820 --> 41:19.660
That might be a really good thing to do here

41:19.660 --> 41:21.600
is just kind of swap the name around,

41:21.600 --> 41:23.460
and then people will go, I had no idea

41:23.460 --> 41:25.180
what you were talking about.

41:25.180 --> 41:28.140
You know, Rockstar is kind of pussying out, I think.

41:28.140 --> 41:29.220
Yeah, I agree.

41:29.220 --> 41:32.140
I don't think they will change it here in America.

41:32.140 --> 41:34.860
and I don't think that may be the reason they changed it in Europe.

41:34.860 --> 41:38.000
Maybe, you know, they do name changes all the time with games in Europe for weird

41:38.000 --> 41:39.740
reasons, it's not a big deal.

41:39.740 --> 41:43.260
It is a pretty dumb name for the game. Yeah, I don't like that game either.

41:43.260 --> 41:47.060
Anyways, there's some interesting news about Resident Evil for the Wii

41:47.060 --> 41:52.220
and it's actually coming from Tara Platt, who is the voice actress for Jill Valentine,

41:52.220 --> 41:55.820
and she confirmed that the game will feature zombies,

41:55.820 --> 42:00.140
or zombie-like enemies, and plant creatures, as well as a wide variety of

42:00.140 --> 42:06.340
of weaponry. The fact that Mrs. Platt was aware of the weapons in the game infers that

42:06.340 --> 42:11.820
she's voicing a playable character and not just doing a cameo. It says Jill being the

42:11.820 --> 42:17.820
main character increases the likelihood of seeing Carlos and Barry turn up as well. That

42:17.820 --> 42:21.300
would be kind of interesting, maybe they're remaking the first one or something? I don't

42:21.300 --> 42:28.800
know. But hopefully it's not a gun survivor game, because those kind of suck.

42:28.800 --> 42:31.840
Are you looking forward to Resident Evil on the Wii?

42:31.840 --> 42:35.160
I guess.

42:35.160 --> 42:43.140
I found something else funny because apparently she sent them an email, I think this is coming

42:43.140 --> 42:49.840
from Kotaku here, I sent them an email about saying that she's not allowed to verify information

42:49.840 --> 42:55.040
about Biohazard 5 or Resident Evil 5 in Japan or in the Wii game.

42:55.040 --> 42:56.680
That's kind of funny.

42:56.680 --> 43:01.520
It's like, oops, I slipped and then I take it all back.

43:01.520 --> 43:08.760
Alright, I have a quick story for you guys here regarding, also on the Wii, the Legend

43:08.760 --> 43:10.800
of Zelda.

43:10.800 --> 43:15.760
In a tiny little blip that IGN wrote earlier this week, they dropped an interesting little

43:15.760 --> 43:16.760
tidbit.

43:16.760 --> 43:21.000
Twilight Princess will not only be bigger, a horse ride from one side of Hyrule to the

43:21.000 --> 43:25.880
next is rumored to take 45 real minutes to get from one side of the world to the other

43:25.880 --> 43:31.240
on horse. Of course, that's nothing compared to a chocobo ride around Final Fantasy XI,

43:31.240 --> 43:33.120
but... That's very true.

43:33.120 --> 43:37.760
MMOs are supposed to be big, though. That's still pretty impressive, you've got to admit.

43:37.760 --> 43:40.600
You gotta imagine how long it's going to take you to walk, then, from the other side.

43:40.600 --> 43:42.360
Okay, but... Horse will significantly increase the speed.

43:42.360 --> 43:46.080
I'm thinking, obviously, at some point you'll be able to play an ocarina and be able to

43:46.080 --> 43:49.400
warp around. Why do you do that with an ocarina?

43:49.400 --> 43:52.320
Because you have to, it's Zelda. No, they don't always have ocarinas.

43:52.320 --> 43:55.360
They could have something else, a flute, something. You know there's going to be a tornado that

43:55.360 --> 43:58.960
wish you away because they're not going to expect people to actually use 45 minutes to

43:58.960 --> 44:04.120
run from one side unless they're exploring or do they well they'd be stupid if they did

44:04.120 --> 44:09.240
they they made you do that crap in um um what's that game wind waker we had to go and find

44:09.240 --> 44:15.360
the triforce pieces and that was hours upon hours of pain wind waker was a little bit

44:15.360 --> 44:22.680
lame compared to the other zeldas and uh uh that other god-awful 64 one uh majora's mask

44:22.680 --> 44:23.680
Don't even get me started.

44:23.680 --> 44:26.480
You know, to be honest, I kind of liked Wind Waker.

44:26.480 --> 44:27.480
It's okay!

44:27.480 --> 44:33.440
I don't know, I would have rather seen that like, you know, kind of, I guess, not Link's

44:33.440 --> 44:41.000
Awakening but, I don't know, one of the older Zelda's done kind of the same style as Wind

44:41.000 --> 44:46.000
Waker, but actually be, you know, for the GameCube and fully 3D and not, you know, this,

44:46.000 --> 44:52.000
you know, for the DS with Wind Waker graphics type of crap, so anyways, anyways, speaking

44:52.000 --> 44:58.120
of stuff that's kind of crappy. Live ads coming to video games. Yes, that's right. EA has

44:58.120 --> 45:03.060
signed a deal with two ad companies that will stream live advertisement into the brand new

45:03.060 --> 45:09.360
Need for Speed Carbon and of course the upcoming PC and probably next gen game Battlefield

45:09.360 --> 45:16.800
2142. It's quite interesting that they're doing this. I mean, they've also kind of run

45:16.800 --> 45:22.000
into a lot of controversy with, you know, gathering information about their users and

45:22.000 --> 45:24.600
whatnot for god knows what reasons.

45:24.600 --> 45:28.440
Maybe now they're going to be gathering information about their users to advertise to them.

45:28.440 --> 45:29.440
I don't know.

45:29.440 --> 45:33.200
I think if I pay for a game, then why the fuck do I gotta see advertisements in the

45:33.200 --> 45:34.200
game as well?

45:34.200 --> 45:38.760
I mean, it's gonna be kind of stupid when I'm playing around Battlefield 2142 and all

45:38.760 --> 45:42.560
of a sudden there's a Toyota Yaris, you know, fucking billboard.

45:42.560 --> 45:45.600
You know, I gotta be honest though, I think the real ads to some extent are gonna be better

45:45.600 --> 45:51.480
to look at them fake ads. I mean, you know, why not? You have fake ads in games as it

45:51.480 --> 45:54.800
is. In terms of... Some of them are funny. Like, especially, I think about You Don't

45:54.800 --> 45:58.280
Know Jack. Like, that game was so awesome. Listen, okay, the fake ads like in Grand Theft

45:58.280 --> 46:05.360
Auto are awesome. I mean, come on, vivisection. It's hilarious. And ammunition. I don't know.

46:05.360 --> 46:09.260
Uh, a chatroom is saying that, um, Funny Dale says Orange Launch Radio needs to have ads

46:09.260 --> 46:15.040
in Saints Row. Oh, that'd be cool. So what do you think? You think this is the end of

46:15.040 --> 46:18.060
video games as we know it or what? Well it's not the end because you know I can ignore

46:18.060 --> 46:21.460
them just as easily as I ignore everything else. At least they're not having like the

46:21.460 --> 46:27.340
bird king king coming out and fucking you know. That would be awesome. I still think

46:27.340 --> 46:30.860
though they should have made him a playable character in fight night round 3 because that

46:30.860 --> 46:33.380
would have been fucking. I would have bought the game. I would have bought fight night

46:33.380 --> 46:37.380
round 3 just for that too. Just for that. So I don't know. Just put the Muppets into

46:37.380 --> 46:41.800
the fight night engine that would be awesome. I mean I gotta say rumble roses ok true that

46:41.800 --> 46:46.860
game was kind of shitty but it was hilarious watching I mean getting to

46:46.860 --> 46:50.600
play the women beating up on each other was so funny because like you know I was

46:50.600 --> 46:54.680
able to give running commentary on the game and I was just going like ow you

46:54.680 --> 46:57.800
just got kicked in the vagina ow you just got kicked in the vagina and it was

46:57.800 --> 47:02.400
really funny wasn't it Mikal Tov no cuz I had to work on the game and I don't

47:02.400 --> 47:05.960
find anything about that game funny anymore cuz it's obnoxious can you tell

47:05.960 --> 47:09.320
us what you did on the game or is that secret would you rather play Bomberman

47:09.320 --> 47:16.040
act zero rumble roses xx i don't really have my hands cut off um no i just worked on text

47:16.040 --> 47:22.440
would i rather play so rumble roses xx or not have a new sweet code game ever again

47:24.840 --> 47:32.520
um if it ended on five that wouldn't be terrible but all right look anything else you want to say

47:32.520 --> 47:37.640
on this topic loki you know i gotta play through that damn game to get the achievements all right

47:37.640 --> 47:43.780

48:01.620 --> 48:04.780
Let's go to the phones and take a call. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

48:04.780 --> 48:08.780
Hi Ravenstaufen, what's on your mind buddy?

48:08.780 --> 48:12.780
The PSP thing and the DS.

48:12.780 --> 48:16.780
You speak on it very briefly and you said, what is wrong with port?

48:16.780 --> 48:20.780
I enjoy Grand Theft Auto. I enjoy

48:20.780 --> 48:24.780
Super Mario Kart.

48:24.780 --> 48:28.780
There's no need for a PSP vs. DS

48:28.780 --> 48:32.780
War. Can't we all just get along?

48:32.780 --> 48:35.780
saying. Everyone should just get along.

48:35.780 --> 48:41.580
Okay, where do you think the PSP's strengths are and what do you think the DS's strengths are?

48:41.580 --> 48:47.280
Well, I think the PSP's strengths are is in the video games and video games and video.

48:47.280 --> 48:50.680
That's where the strength is.

48:50.680 --> 48:52.580
Okay.

48:52.580 --> 48:58.180
And it really does well with that. And the DS is, you know, DS is good for like,

48:58.180 --> 49:04.340
and that's what the Wii is going to be like. It's going to be like touch screen.

49:04.340 --> 49:06.580
I mean not touch screen.

49:06.580 --> 49:09.540
A different way of interacting with the game.

49:09.540 --> 49:10.560
Yeah.

49:10.560 --> 49:13.980
Well who knows there are rumors that the DS could be used as a controller on the

49:13.980 --> 49:16.860
Wii, much like you could use a Game Boy Advance on the GameCube with that

49:16.860 --> 49:18.260
special little hookup.

49:18.260 --> 49:21.940
So maybe there will be touch screen Wii games in the future, who knows?

49:21.940 --> 49:28.020
Whereas the PSP, you can only use as your rear view mirror on the PlayStation 3.

49:28.020 --> 49:29.540
That was funny, though.

49:29.540 --> 49:33.900
No, in all seriousness, that is a pretty cool feature. Expensive, but good.

49:33.900 --> 49:39.420
I mean, I think it's going to be a lot. Wouldn't you think, if the PSP didn't come along, that

49:39.420 --> 49:44.440
that will be showing, that there will be like, ports of the Nintendo 64 games a lot?

49:44.440 --> 49:46.860
A lot more...

49:46.860 --> 49:50.780
Oh, run that by me again? Because you're kind of, you're kind of cutting out a little bit.

49:50.780 --> 49:52.780
Oh. Okay.

49:52.780 --> 50:00.280
It's like, if the PSP didn't come along, the Nintendo 64, of course, would be on the Nintendo DS, on the Nintendo DS.

50:00.280 --> 50:06.040
Right, that's kind of what a Nintendo DS feels like to me, is a Nintendo 64 with touch-screen graphics.

50:06.040 --> 50:12.980
Yeah, but if the PSP didn't come along, that would all be, it would be like...

50:12.980 --> 50:15.040
Okay.

50:15.040 --> 50:18.440
And I thank the PSP for that and for its innovation.

50:18.440 --> 50:22.320
Okay, I gotcha. Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners?

50:22.320 --> 50:23.960
My internet sucks tonight, Sky.

50:23.960 --> 50:25.920
That's why I'm calling on my cell phone.

50:25.920 --> 50:26.640
All right.

50:26.640 --> 50:27.680
Oh, it's a cell phone.

50:27.680 --> 50:29.840
That answers a lot, because it's a little bit fuzzy.

50:29.840 --> 50:30.720
But that's all right.

50:30.720 --> 50:33.440
We appreciate the phone call, nevertheless.

50:33.440 --> 50:34.520
All right, thank you, Sky.

50:34.520 --> 50:36.240
Have a good week, my friend.

50:36.240 --> 50:36.800
You too, Sky.

50:36.800 --> 50:38.560
Until next time.

50:38.560 --> 50:40.880
Let's go to the phones, orangehonnashradio.com.

50:40.880 --> 50:44.560
Click on interact with us, or 916-226-9067.

50:44.560 --> 50:45.400
Whoa, shit.

50:45.400 --> 50:46.940
Hi, you're on Orange Honnash Radio.

50:46.940 --> 50:47.640
Who's this?

50:47.640 --> 50:48.600
Legend of Saku.

50:48.600 --> 50:49.600
Hello, my friend.

50:49.600 --> 50:51.360
What's on your mind, buddy?

50:51.360 --> 50:57.540
Basically, why is everyone getting and you know their panties in a bunch about bullying especially groups

50:57.540 --> 51:01.800
I think they know a lot about the game yet. They're protesting, you know

51:02.440 --> 51:07.300
Misinformation because it's teaching the youth of America how to smoke crack and worship Satan

51:08.100 --> 51:13.360
Actually bullies teaching them about the the right thing to do fighting back. Well now wait a minute

51:13.360 --> 51:17.900
That's a thing. It's a pretty that you debatable. Look every family can you get put? Yeah

51:17.900 --> 51:21.460
Yeah, I mean, you get pumped around, you fight back.

51:21.460 --> 51:24.720
My parents didn't choose to raise me that way, they didn't choose to raise me to fight

51:24.720 --> 51:25.720
back.

51:25.720 --> 51:27.800
Oh, did they raise you to use your words?

51:27.800 --> 51:31.600
No, they raised me to go run and tell the principal and then sue him.

51:31.600 --> 51:32.600
Wow.

51:32.600 --> 51:34.680
No, I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.

51:34.680 --> 51:37.760
But something along those lines, you don't fight violence with violence.

51:37.760 --> 51:38.760
Not in my household.

51:38.760 --> 51:43.400
I sort of suspect that the peace of colleagues are being manipulated by, you know, a he who

51:43.400 --> 51:44.400
cannot be named.

51:44.400 --> 51:45.400
All right.

51:45.400 --> 51:50.280
Okay, well needless to say it's up to a parent how they want to raise their kids or whatever fine

51:50.680 --> 51:56.280
And it was and it should also be up to a parent how they want or what games they want their sorry

51:56.520 --> 51:59.880
I've been drinking a little bit. It's also up to a parent too, man. That's fine

52:00.360 --> 52:04.600
Uh, yeah, you're slurring too a little bit. Um, it's up to yeah, I tried hours ago. Shut up

52:04.600 --> 52:07.000
I'm trying to think uh, it's also up to a parent

52:07.720 --> 52:09.480
how

52:09.480 --> 52:13.320
God damn it. They are it's up to a parent what games they want their kids to play, right?

52:13.320 --> 52:26.320
Yeah, that's true. They ultimately control what the kid actually plays, and that's where all the responsibility falls, not the government.

52:26.320 --> 52:37.320
Not the right of the government to tell us how to live our lives, to an extent. Obviously, murder, stealing, and all that other stuff have to be regulated.

52:37.320 --> 52:42.520
But okay, well now wait a minute now here. Here's another question for you. What about freedom of speech these guys?

52:42.520 --> 52:44.380
Yeah, right these guys have a right well

52:44.380 --> 52:48.800
I'm defending these guys a little bit just be devil's advocate these guys have a right to protest

52:48.920 --> 52:52.480
Just as we have the right to get on internet radio and calm stupid heads

52:52.840 --> 52:57.280
Yeah, I respect that right, but I also have the right to criticize not you know

52:57.280 --> 53:02.940
I'm trying to be very constructive in that I'm pointing out their fallacies like a fact that they're saying that the FCC

53:02.940 --> 53:07.660
see regulates you know you know regulates the the whole content rating

53:07.660 --> 53:12.660
which actually the ESRB does and the fact that they're saying that rock stars

53:12.660 --> 53:18.860
a bunch of terrorists that just blown out of proportion okay I can agree with

53:18.860 --> 53:22.500
that what could these guys do better if they will get their point across

53:22.500 --> 53:27.220
basically they need to play the game and then criticize you don't criticize

53:27.220 --> 53:31.260
something that you don't know or haven't seen or have an experience and that's

53:31.260 --> 53:34.700
That's what people, you know, it's been done already in the past.

53:34.700 --> 53:40.460
People have jumped the gun too quickly without knowing the whole side of the story and they

53:40.460 --> 53:41.860
just made up their mind already.

53:41.860 --> 53:44.980
Yeah, you know what guys, Halo 3 fucking sucks.

53:44.980 --> 53:49.180
I hate to tell you, but it's going to be the biggest letdown of the year.

53:49.180 --> 53:55.100
It's a horrible game, live is so buggy you guys, you won't even believe.

53:55.100 --> 53:59.860
Basically it's just, you know, those people who make up their mind without hearing the

53:59.860 --> 54:00.860
other side of the story.

54:00.860 --> 54:06.620
they're fools. They're just literally fools. They're not that smart to actually, you know,

54:06.620 --> 54:10.220
they don't have the guts to actually experience, you know, the other side of the story and

54:10.220 --> 54:14.860
then make them, you know, make up their mind and what they want to, you know, stand for.

54:14.860 --> 54:18.460
Alright, any other words you have for our listeners tonight?

54:18.460 --> 54:21.860
That was pretty much it and just, you know, don't drink in 2DX.

54:21.860 --> 54:24.820
Okay, I won't. Bye.

54:24.820 --> 54:26.820
Alright man

54:28.400 --> 54:30.400
Don't drink in 2dx, okay

54:32.620 --> 54:35.760
It's chat rooms yelling at me over that halo 3 comment

54:35.760 --> 54:38.580
I was kidding you guys it was it was it was a joke in a way

54:38.580 --> 54:42.100
It was a bad joke, but it was a joke if that makes any sense at all

54:42.260 --> 54:47.700
We'll take one more call if anybody actually wants to call us area code 9 1 6 2 2 6 90 67

54:47.700 --> 54:49.300
Remember kids that may be a toll call

54:49.300 --> 54:52.900
We are too cheap to get an 800 number or at least Skype doesn't offer him yet

54:52.900 --> 54:55.700
or you can Skype us, user name OrangeLoungeRadio.

54:55.700 --> 54:57.620
But I'm noticing the phones are a little dead tonight.

54:57.620 --> 54:59.240
It's a little weird for us.

54:59.240 --> 55:00.840
We usually have like tons of people calling in,

55:00.840 --> 55:01.680
but not tonight.

55:01.680 --> 55:02.500
It is a three-day weekend.

55:02.500 --> 55:04.960
Everyone is kind of on vacation.

55:04.960 --> 55:07.720
Out drinkin' at their local Labor Day barbecues.

55:07.720 --> 55:09.920
You know, do you know what was going on?

55:09.920 --> 55:11.240
Do you know?

55:11.240 --> 55:12.080
No, I don't know.

55:12.080 --> 55:12.900
Zords, come on.

55:12.900 --> 55:15.660
Do you know what was going on in town here locally tonight?

55:15.660 --> 55:16.500
No.

55:16.500 --> 55:20.340
And I'm here at this show instead of being at this event.

55:20.340 --> 55:23.460
There's a big gay pride fest going on downtown.

55:23.460 --> 55:27.000
In this, they have Riken from The Amazing Race.

55:27.000 --> 55:28.220
I know you love him.

55:28.220 --> 55:31.580
And probably his boyfriend Lance Bass is there too.

55:31.580 --> 55:35.060
Tiffany and Debbie Gibson on the same stage.

55:35.060 --> 55:37.940
That sounds terrible.

55:37.940 --> 55:40.220
Yeah, but you're a homophobic gay man.

55:40.220 --> 55:41.580
That's true, but it's still terrible.

55:41.580 --> 55:43.340
That's how I describe you to all my friends, Shane.

55:43.340 --> 55:44.660
You're a homophobic gay man.

55:44.660 --> 55:45.180
I know.

55:45.180 --> 55:45.860
All right.

55:45.860 --> 55:47.180
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

55:47.180 --> 55:49.940
Who's better, Tiffany or Debbie Gibson?

55:49.940 --> 55:56.940
me. Hi, who's me? Me is Drunami. Drunami, you didn't sing Electric Youth, okay?

55:57.120 --> 56:01.500
I could, if I knew what the hell it was. Have you been drinking tonight?

56:01.500 --> 56:06.580
Uh, yes. Then I bet you could sing the first few bars of Electric Youth, come on.

56:06.580 --> 56:11.900
I can make it up as I go. It's electric youth. I have no idea what you're talking about.

56:11.900 --> 56:14.140
Alright, fine. What's on your mind then?

56:14.140 --> 56:16.820
Uh, Miklotov

56:16.820 --> 56:18.600
for one.

56:18.600 --> 56:22.700
uh... sukodin sucks and you suck too for not being drunk

56:22.700 --> 56:24.300
i don't drink anymore

56:24.300 --> 56:28.000
you know i you know we have to respect his right to be sober it's fine

56:28.000 --> 56:29.540
and we don't have to like it

56:29.540 --> 56:36.540
Suikodin does not suck. Somebody has to drive you to life after the show. I'm just saying it to piss you off. You do know that. I haven't even fucking played sukodin.

56:36.540 --> 56:40.960
I know this is just like last time. Did you call in to say anything intelligent?

56:40.960 --> 56:44.100
or did you just come on to fuck up the show that's what i want to know

56:44.100 --> 56:46.500
Yeah, I'm calling to fuck up the show, and, uh...

56:46.500 --> 56:50.400
Then I'm hanging up on you, bitch, unless you have something intelligent to say!

56:50.400 --> 56:53.800
Oh, uh, next time we do Beat the Hosts, I am so in.

56:53.800 --> 56:56.800
I don't care!

56:56.800 --> 56:59.600
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

56:59.600 --> 57:01.600
Hello, this is NintendoManiac64.

57:01.600 --> 57:04.400
Hi, NintendoManiac64, what's on your mind?

57:04.400 --> 57:05.200
Um...

57:05.200 --> 57:08.400
I just berated the last caller, so I'm in an angry mode.

57:08.400 --> 57:11.100
So you better have something good to say, what's on your mind?

57:11.100 --> 57:13.500
Well, this is just a simple question.

57:13.500 --> 57:17.220
I sent in a response to the mailbag, but nobody read it.

57:17.220 --> 57:18.180
We might have read it.

57:18.180 --> 57:19.500
We just ignored it for now.

57:19.500 --> 57:22.060
We might get into it next week.

57:22.060 --> 57:23.940
Well, I guess we'll do your question,

57:23.940 --> 57:25.220
since you have a question.

57:25.220 --> 57:26.860
What is your question?

57:26.860 --> 57:27.420
OK.

57:27.420 --> 57:30.900
I remember something about last year or so

57:30.900 --> 57:33.820
that you mentioned something about an Ogg-Vorbis stream.

57:33.820 --> 57:34.940
Did that ever exist?

57:34.940 --> 57:35.940
A what?

57:35.940 --> 57:38.180
Like an Ogg-Vorbis stream?

57:38.180 --> 57:39.980
Oh, OK.

57:39.980 --> 57:45.500
that would involve us getting off of live 365 which right now we have other

57:45.500 --> 57:50.260
options we're pursuing is all I can say right now so the OGG stream is a

57:50.260 --> 57:53.660
little bit on hold it was something we were exploring previously we do know it

57:53.660 --> 57:58.420
would give a little bit of a better sound than MP3 Pro but we're just not going to do it at

57:58.420 --> 58:00.860
this time. Why? Is there something you want to say about OGG?

58:00.860 --> 58:04.980
Well it's just that I thought of it and I'm like wait I know he said something about Ogg Vorbis

58:04.980 --> 58:09.940
screen but I had no idea what so okay so it must be like a future idea or

58:09.940 --> 58:13.940
something um yes but we have another future idea that's taking precedence

58:13.940 --> 58:19.340
and that's all I can say at this time lame sorry do you have any comments on

58:19.340 --> 58:33.260
tonight's stories otherwise no okay I'm bored let's go I need to drink more

58:33.260 --> 58:43.780
I'm sorry, I do love the collars, I really do.

58:43.780 --> 58:48.020
I think this is what every iTunes reviewer has always wanted us to do to the calls.

58:48.020 --> 58:50.500
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

58:50.500 --> 58:52.420
Hello, this is Jayden.

58:52.420 --> 58:54.420
Hi Jayden, what's on your mind buddy?

58:54.420 --> 58:59.100
Keep in mind I'm in a bad mood, so make it good.

58:59.100 --> 59:05.100
I'm just reading all these DS reviews, I guess you could say.

59:05.100 --> 59:08.100
What's up? Like what DS reviews?

59:08.100 --> 59:09.100
Pardon me?

59:09.100 --> 59:11.100
You say DS reviews?

59:11.100 --> 59:13.100
Yes, DS reviews.

59:13.100 --> 59:15.100
Okay, what's on your mind with the DS reviews?

59:15.100 --> 59:21.100
Actually all these new products, or actually all these full products that I saw for the DS.

59:21.100 --> 59:25.100
Wait, who's writing the DS reviews? Because I want to know if I value their opinion or not.

59:25.100 --> 59:26.100
or not?

59:26.100 --> 59:31.500
Um, actually they're not reviews, they're just products that I think are pretty cool

59:31.500 --> 59:32.500
for the DS.

59:32.500 --> 59:34.700
Alright, well what are they?

59:34.700 --> 59:46.180
Like I found the DS Rumble Pack, I also found the DS TV Tuner, I also found the DS Memory

59:46.180 --> 59:47.180
Expansion.

59:47.180 --> 59:48.460
Is this a website or something?

59:48.460 --> 59:54.460
Um, no, I just have a friend that's looking up random, uh, random DS things.

59:54.460 --> 59:57.460
Okay. Oh, are you gonna buy these, or what?

59:57.460 --> 01:00:00.460
I mean, he's thinking about it, actually.

01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:02.460
Okay.

01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:08.460
So, on top of that, um, about your game, Beat the Host.

01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:12.460
Yes! Beat the Host! We love Beat the Host.

01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:19.100
Yes. You want to get into some really oddball stuff, how about you do stuff from the Atari era?

01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:26.260
Okay, look. If you say it, though, then everybody's prepared for it so it's not so offbeat. You know what I mean?

01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:26.760
True.

01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:30.460
Okay, I do like the idea of Atari 2600 stuff, but here's the problem.

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:39.460
A lot of the folks that listen to our program are like 17, and weren't even a sperm yet when Atari 2600 was out.

01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:41.540
Oh, okay.

01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:45.540
So, I don't know. I mean, I guess we could, but I don't know.

01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:48.540
Would you do an Atari 2600 beat the host?

01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:51.540
Maybe. I would probably get it less right.

01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:54.540
Well, here's the thing is a lot of Atari 2600 games didn't have music.

01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:57.540
We will take it under consideration for the future.

01:00:57.540 --> 01:00:58.540
How's that sound?

01:00:58.540 --> 01:00:59.540
Pardon?

01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:04.540
We will take it under consideration for the future. How's that sound?

01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:06.540
Yeah, that would sound pretty good.

01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:07.540
Alright.

01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:10.540
An Atari 2600 games did have music.

01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:14.900
very very very little though but you know like if you are

01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:18.300
okay like if you play that sound from pac-man that doo doo doo doo

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:22.300
I would totally know that I mean there certain games have those key sounds

01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:23.220
you'll never forget

01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:26.380
well yeah also

01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:29.740
you're also you're forgetting the

01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:33.580
Atari 7800, the Atari 800, the Atari 400

01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:36.580
wait okay now you're just getting crazy because

01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:40.260
not that many people play those systems I mean we could I guess

01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:43.640
But then why don't I throw in VIC-20 games while we're at it? Come on.

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:46.880
Hey, that would be a pretty good idea.

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:50.720
What? You need to throw in those Tiger electronic cells.

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:54.400
But that's assuming that the host would be able to get any points at all. We

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:56.440
don't want to embarrass ourselves through this game.

01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:00.360
But you have to cover all genres of games.

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:03.780
Alright, we'll think about it. We're taking all your suggestions under consideration.

01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:06.180
Thank you for your feedback. Anything else you want to share with the listeners?

01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:09.360
No, I just... Alright, then that's it.

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:16.320
let's get you you're so mean i'm sorry jaded's a good guy too he

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:20.320
really supports us i shouldn't have hung up on him but i'm just feeling a little

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:24.560
i'm a little feisty tonight um should we do one more call

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:27.600
do you want to see if anybody else would call since we're doing short calls

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:29.680
tonight you're only short because you keep

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:34.640
hanging up on them why am i so loud oh because i have the

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:37.040
because i don't know our callers have been kind of quiet so i had to turn it

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:38.040
up in the studio.

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:39.040
Okay.

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:40.040
I don't know, our phone's not ringing now.

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:41.040
So maybe that's it.

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:42.040
Does anybody have a last minute story?

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:44.040
We'll see if the phone rings during the last minute story.

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:45.040
I have lots of last minute stories.

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:46.040
Alright, give us one real quick.

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:48.840
Well anyways, let's talk about the PS3.

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:49.840
Guess what?

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:53.000
You pay $600 for it, you get no HDMI cable.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:59.520
So it sucks to be you hooking it up to a high end media center or something like that.

01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:01.560
So yeah, whatever.

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:08.000
And then of course, some other things, speaking since he was talking about, well they were

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:14.040
talking about accessories for the DS, Europe is supposed to be seeing a DS MP3 player this

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:17.240
October, so that's kind of neat.

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:24.520
And supposedly it's going to be using the flash, what was it, just like those SD memory

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:25.520
cards.

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:28.020
Alright, we're getting another call on the Skypline so I'm going to go to that right

01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:29.020
now okay?

01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:30.020
Okie dokie.

01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:38.680
launch radio who's this no one it's a crank call crank call okay and the last

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:46.880
one I had which was really cool there's five games that are coming to Xbox Live

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:52.880
arcade from the video and you might know them Vidi who happened to be they own

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:56.840
the rights to the Sierra games so we're gonna be getting wonderful games like

01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:01.840
Megaforce, which I never played, 3D Ultra Mini Golf, which was fucking awesome on the

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:08.680
PC and I used to play this online all the time, Red Baron, and two other games, one

01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:14.840
based on The Incredible Machine and one based on the popular TV series Battlestar Galactica.

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:19.360
I am incredibly excited about The Incredible Machine game, which is kind of ironic.

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:21.340
Wait, where is The Incredible Machine coming out?

01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:22.340
Xbox Live Arcade.

01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:24.760
Oh my god, that is hot.

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:25.760
That is so hot.

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:26.760
I love The Incredible Machine.

01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:33.400
one of the best games they ever did. I love that game. Dude, Sierra or Vivendi who I guess

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:39.920
now owns all the Sierra shit? Yeah. Seriously? King's Quest? King's Quest, Space Quest, Leisure

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:45.400
Suit Larry, bring me these games on a console. Yes, I know I can get most of that stuff through

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:49.840
GameTap and that's cool, but you know I played those games on a computer before. I want to

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:56.260
do something on a console. I want achievement points for King's Quest 4. Is that too much

01:04:56.260 --> 01:05:03.600
to ask. You want to know something funny and this is just purely observational. Gamersreports.com,

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:07.140
they have a banner, you know how they have banner ads on websites and stuff like that?

01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:12.840
This one has a banner ad for a London escort service. I just thought that was kind of funny.

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:19.060
Cause they have escorts on a gaming news site. I don't know. I'm easily amused tonight. Yeah

01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:24.760
I know I'm I'm oh yeah and I'm a little bit there's rumors about rez coming to

01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:29.440
the weeb oh yeah yeah I'll be kind of cool yeah I don't know if that's really

01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:33.880
anything you know I don't know they've actually got info to back that up but

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:38.980
uh it's probably one of those yeah that would be cool that you know I'm

01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:44.280
seriously considering it yeah that was the the the quote here I'm currently

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:48.800
seriously considering it it's always been there it's always I'm always

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:51.760
thinking about it also space channel 5

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:56.240
yes space channel 5 is so awesome

01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:59.520
I love that game space channel 5 on the

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:02.120
we do I just can you imagine that like

01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:03.960
where you'd have to do like the motions

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.640
for like different dances and stuff so

01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:08.320
you chew chew so you'd be doing the

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:10.360
dances to that kind of funny

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:14.400
alright anything else that's it that's

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:16.280
going to bring our show to a close them

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:18.520
for this evening I like to go around to

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:21.560
to get everybody's final thought thank you guys by the way for tuning in

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:25.520
supporting independent radio I know we were a little crazy tonight and you know

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:28.760
we appreciate you guys sticking by us no matter what mikkel tov thank you for

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:32.680
being here even though you barely ever talked at all I'm reading what are you

01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:35.440
reading what's more important you're chatting on instant messenger at least

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:39.520
be honest well I'm also reading about blue me who are you chatting with on

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:43.400
instant messenger jazz and I don't remember his name on DDR freaking that

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:51.840
That makes me angry, but the guy that sent the cookies for Ultramix 2, I only know him

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:52.840
by his real name now.

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:53.840
I don't remember.

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:55.360
I know his name on Xbox Live, but I can't.

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:56.360
El Mullet.

01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:57.360
El Mullet, yes.

01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:59.720
I'm talking to El Mullet.

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:00.720
How's he doing?

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:01.720
I haven't heard from him in a while.

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:02.720
I guess he's doing this.

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:03.720
Does he still listen to this show?

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:04.720
I have no idea because I didn't ask him.

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:05.720
Ask him if he's listening.

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:06.720
I'll maybe do that later.

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:07.720
Fine.

01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:09.200
We're talking about Dance Factory right now.

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:10.200
Alright, fine.

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:11.400
Yeah, that game came out last week.

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:14.200
Yeah, and it's pretty stupid from what I understand, but it's getting good scores.

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:15.200
It is getting good scores.

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:16.600
Yeah, you know what the scores are?

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:18.700
Well, cuz then you can put any song in it.

01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:21.200
Yeah, but all those dance steps are probably crap.

01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:23.100
Yeah, and off sync apparently.

01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:25.900
And it's iToy mode doesn't work, I guess.

01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:27.600
Which makes it equally cool.

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:32.800
Yeah, they have a bundle with a really crappy dance pad coming out in October.

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:33.400
I thought that was funny.

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:37.000
That's something I'll be skipping.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.300
You know what game they should put out over here that's coming out in the UK?

01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:40.300
What?

01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:41.900
uh... b boy

01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:43.360
they look pretty cool

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:45.520
and vaguely remember that

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:49.860
it's like uh... you know break-dancing yeah but it's not the art that have like

01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:50.500
uh...

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:53.100

01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:56.860
great thing

01:07:56.860 --> 01:07:58.540

01:07:58.540 --> 01:08:01.060

01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:31.460
to play it was just fun to watch sorry what's wrong i'm a little bit out of it i've had a

01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:36.460
I'm tired of that, and to be honest, you want the rest of this?

01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:37.460
Sure, why not?

01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:39.460
You're not going to drink anymore?

You're a wimp, you're sober, how many fingers am I holding up?

01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:46.460

01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:51.460
Two, three, two, four.

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:55.460
If you guys can see this right now, it's the stupidest thing ever.

01:08:55.460 --> 01:08:58.460
You can't go out in public if you're like this.

01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:02.420
