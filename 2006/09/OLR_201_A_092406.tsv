13905	26518	Tonight, September 24th, 2006, PlayStation 3 reaction from the Tokyo Game Show, the cult shooter classic is about to get a sequel, and the company that makes music game controllers sues someone over music game controllers.
32918	34438	Hello everybody out there on the internet.
34558	37479	Welcome once again to Orange Lounge Radio.
37879	43280	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, and the gamer culture and lifestyle.
43720	44660	My name is Rob Roberts.
44680	45700	You might know me as Sky.
45760	50281	Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Miss Jamie Summers.
50661	51101	Rawr.
51361	51822	How you doing?
52382	52802	Rawr.
52942	53262	Rawr.
54322	54722	Rawr.
55022	55522	Or Zip.
56842	58643	Or ARJ if you're old school.
58983	59483	Rawr.
59503	59603	Rawr.
61953	65175	Also say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
65776	65976	Hi.
66276	66737	How you doing?
69198	69839	I'm frustrated.
70239	70459	Why?
71160	73822	Because certain things aren't working the way they should be.
74282	74663	I see.
75363	76024	Don't you hate that?
76644	77305	I do hate that.
77945	80827	How things are described is very simple, yet never are.
81888	82608	Welcome to life.
82789	83429	Here's your manual.
84490	87212	Also say hello to joining us tonight once again.
88126	89127	7-Zip is the wave of the future, dammit
116505	135475	or if you want to hear the whole thing in bulk you can listen to us live when we record on OrangeLawnRadio.com on Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time or you can listen to our rebroadcast live of Parts A and B that plays on All Games Radio over at AllGames.com and that plays Monday nights at 5 o'clock Pacific or I believe 9 a.m.
135695	136415	on Tuesdays.
136535	142018	So if you're an early bird you can always catch that and you can hear all the show before it hits the podcast stream.
142538	146722	Anyway, we're going to start off as we always do, talking about our gaming week.
147042	149444	Or in DarkSakura's case, perhaps her pinball week.
149544	149924	I don't know.
150805	151346	Yeah, really.
151426	159733	Actually, all I played this week was Star Trek The Next Generation Pinball, which we finally have mostly working, except for a couple of...
160956	164038	Really crappy soldering jobs, whoever the previous owner was.
164418	171641	Just like, oh, let's just put a bunch of goo here and solder it and let's use hot glue to put this ramp back together and all this crap.
171781	173342	Well, Dan's been working on it.
173382	174423	It's working just fine now.
175143	176524	And other than that, I ain't played crap.
176884	178605	Because I've been like, urgh!
179185	180325	I've been sick all this past week.
180846	182106	Pinball's still a type of game.
182346	183607	Pinball is what we had before Pong.
183767	184287	Pinball!
190422	193584	is the backbone of the gaming community.
194165	197267	Well, them's big words there, but I would agree.
197307	200750	Without pinball, we would not have our arcades.
201210	203992	In the gaming tree, pinball is an essential branch.
205133	206194	Pinball is the root.
206614	207855	I know I've said it before on this show.
207915	213599	Pinball was something I went to the arcades to play before DDR, because I didn't play a whole lot in the arcades before that.
213940	218543	Maybe your occasional fighter, Street Fighter II, back when that was huge, when I was in junior high school.
219256	220737	using E-Honda's 100-Hand Slap.
220757	224500	Look, I was 100-Hand Slapping, bitches, long before Xbox Live, okay?
224580	239171	Well, I remember going back in the old days and playing Old Black Knight before it had a digital display, playing the Time Machine one before we had digital displays.
239271	239891	Pinbot.
240452	242593	I was going to say, Pinbot was the shit.
242914	245435	Was Pinbot... I'll ask you this, then we'll move on.
245796	247417	Was Pinbot on the NES...
248211	253796	A great thing or a horrible mistransformation of the pinball experience?
253996	255257	Believe it or not, I didn't have it.
255537	262003	The first pinball games that I actually played on a home console was this, like, Gator game on the old school Game Boy.
262043	263164	Oh, God, Revenge of the Gator, yes.
263184	269169	Revenge of the Gator and Devil's Crush on TurboGrafx.
269189	270250	Did you ever play Pinball Quest?
270530	270650	No.
270790	271431	You gotta find that.
271451	273052	Sonic Spinball, however, was my game.
273232	274373	Sonic Spinball was pretty awesome.
274534	274634	Yep.
274654	275054	I'll give you that.
275814	278475	Pinball Quest, though, is an interesting 8-bit title.
278535	282937	It's one of those things, like, it was a really good concept, but it was a little bit glitchy sometimes.
283137	284358	I do have to agree with Actdeft.
284378	287939	Terminator 2 pinball ruled, but we're actually trying to work on getting a Medieval Madness.
289120	295543	Well, if you want to join our chatroom and make comments, such as that last person just did, you can join our chatroom over at www.orangelandrady.com.
295563	296563	Click on chat.
296723	299685	Oh, one thing I need to tell Jaded is that we have a Guns N' Roses now.
300385	300645	Oh, yeah.
301104	302485	Dan's Busy Rearranging Our Entire House
329088	332229	Trying to get four pinball machines in and two maim cabinets.
332429	334850	And yet I still have not come over and played all these pinball machines.
334890	335530	I think I need to.
335670	338731	He's building me a maim cabinet out of a Tekken 3, so I'm fairly happy.
338811	339331	That's pretty hot.
340191	341311	Alright, well, we'll move on.
341371	342712	Loki, how was your gaming week?
342772	343612	Did you play any pinball?
344132	344712	No, I did not.
344892	345432	That's too bad.
345492	346253	Well, what did you play?
347493	350534	Well, I played Saints Row and did a little bit more than that.
350594	351274	That was pretty fun.
352214	355515	And a little bit of Bomberman, just because I have it.
356896	358096	And Cookie Mama, I
358905	359786	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
379912	381613	I've gotten rid of most of my other DS games.
381633	388419	Okay, tell, explain to us, you know, because there's probably a lot of people who've seen this game on the shelves, you know, it's Cookie Mama, and it's gone, what the F is that?
388579	389360	So what the F is that?
389380	398407	It's basically a bunch of mini-games that, you know, you play through, and depending on how you, you know, you complete them, you get a score at the end.
398467	403391	And basically they have different, you know, mini-games depending on what dish you're, you know, creating.
403451	403611	So...
404232	408254	For example, rice, you know, you'll have, you know, the first mini-game will be measure out the rice.
408574	411475	And you have to measure it to a line, and you have to do it within a time limit.
411875	414536	And then they have another one that's a Japanese import game, right?
415257	415437	Yeah.
415637	418178	Okay, just... So rice is the first stage?
418458	419438	Rice is the first stage.
419458	419819	Okay.
419879	421639	And then you have to measure out the water.
421659	422200	That's your joke here, sorry.
422220	425781	And then you have, you know, the stage where you have to wash the rice.
426381	428962	And then you have the stage where you have to cook the rice.
429363	432324	And they're all just, like, basically rhythm and, you know...
433720	436061	Just kind of, like, cutting and tapping and stuff like that.
436081	439582	Now, see, wouldn't this game be more fun, though, if there was rapping in the background, you know?
440002	440542	Possibly.
442742	443683	Now, wash the rice.
443743	444603	Do-do-do-do-do.
444823	447264	Like, or what was the, uh, I'm the cooking chicken.
447344	452865	Well, here's, the problem with the game is the sensitivity is really, like, off on a lot of the games.
453025	456066	So, you know, you're really going to get frustrated with stuff.
457691	457992	I don't know.
458412	464355	And then there's also some levels that don't really give you a good description of what you're supposed to do, so it's kind of hard and you get frustrated real easy.
464575	467736	Which is why Nellie stopped playing, because she couldn't figure out what the hell she was supposed to do in certain levels.
468397	470358	Because it doesn't really explain it to you.
470378	476561	They give you the option to practice it, but they don't really kind of take you through a tutorial to tell you how to cook.
477221	478522	They're just like, DO IT!
479982	481143	Because Japanese are smarter.
481623	484445	So, that's just the way that is.
485045	485125	Um,
485523	486984	Grand Theft Auto, Zuma, Fusion Frenzy 2
503413	506596	Fusion Frenzy 2 sucks balls, and I will not be buying that game.
506656	506977	Why?
507337	508318	It looked interesting for the trailer.
508338	509760	It was extremely lame.
510100	510981	Extremely lame.
511001	511902	What was lame about it?
512243	513965	Well, the games themselves are just dumb.
514265	520592	Like, there's one level, it's like, we're trying to be Mario Party, but we're not even coming near Mario Party.
520652	523936	It's just all these mini-games that have, there's like no point to them.
524987	526308	and they're just dumb.
526709	534116	Well, is it maybe just because it's a demo and maybe it's just not... All the other minigames, you know, are just kind of variations of these minigames.
534656	544966	It's just like, you know, there's one of them that you're kind of these gladiator, you know, American gladiator type ball things and you're rolling around and you basically, okay, who can cover the most space with their color?
545886	547508	And, okay, that's kind of lame.
547830	557181	and then there is another one where you have to pick up boxes and put them in your corner and you can steal boxes from other players it's just it screams Mario Kart but or not Mario Kart Mario Party
557742	559863	Without any of the actual board stuff.
560064	561805	It's just a very lame, generic game.
563366	569509	And surprising enough, it's also by Hudson, which made the wonderful smash hit game Bomberman Act Zero.
569590	570610	So are we surprised?
570630	572952	Okay, but at the same time, they also made Mario Party.
573432	574513	Excellent, but you know what?
574553	578695	They've really sucked it up on the 360 so far, so whatever.
578975	580116	Did you ever play the first one?
580817	581137	No, I didn't.
581157	582878	Because there's an interesting comment in our chatroom here.
583058	586280	Mystic Gohan says, Fusion Frenzy 2 sucked, but number one owned.
587372	590174	Well, maybe this is going to be better in a full game, but I'm not buying it.
590274	591295	So, whatever.
591756	594938	I also played the new Tenchu game, which was only available in Japan.
595639	597060	And it's pretty cool.
597280	603725	You know, I wasn't really into Tenchu, but I like running around jumping on buildings and stuff and throwing ninja stars in the people's heads.
603986	604806	So that's kind of cool.
604986	605627	Well, that sounds fun.
605907	606888	Yeah, so that's fun.
607108	610131	The only problem about that game, because it was in Japanese... Sounds like Shinobi.
610311	615335	I had trouble figuring out the controls, because it is kind of difficult to figure out what you've got to do.
615779	616600	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
634526	634866	Really?
635466	635566	Yeah.
635586	637327	Because I've heard a lot of positive reviews elsewhere.
637347	638867	Okay, the camera is blurry as fuck.
639707	641127	Blurry, blurry, blurry.
641407	642807	Did you just do something to it?
642887	643028	No.
643048	644008	Did you leave the sticker on?
644248	646148	No, there is no sticker on this thing.
646688	648088	I don't think there is a sticker on this thing.
649009	650349	No, there is no sticker on this thing.
650369	651669	It would have been hella funny if there was.
651749	652869	And he's like, son of a bitch!
654109	654289	No.
654529	656970	Okay, so, it's very blurry.
657370	658250	Very, very blurry.
658270	663031	That's because it knew what you and Nellie were going to be doing with it, so it had to blur out the naughty bits.
664295	664815	Plugin PC Work
685621	687522	No, of course it's never going to be like that.
687602	689463	So I got the updated drivers for it.
689763	692805	It's funny because the old drivers work kind of crappy, but they work.
693025	694546	The new drivers don't work at all.
694926	698328	So this thing is just, it's doing nothing.
698428	705232	I was going to have a webcam for you guys, folks, and we were going to have the wonderful webcam, but you can thank Microsoft for putting out a really shoddy camera.
705652	707113	What would happen if I plugged that in my Mac?
707373	708313	You think it would work right away?
710515	712095	No, it'll just go, what the hell is this?
712135	713576	I'm going to freaking try it during the break.
713916	714677	You know I got to try.
715595	716315	Well, here's the thing.
716755	717336	Just for you.
717496	718296	That's the thing, though.
718336	720597	Like I said, the generic drivers worked on it.
720677	721877	The new drivers do not.
722378	724618	So go right ahead and try that.
724698	725419	But you know what?
726199	726919	The new drivers don't.
727039	728220	So whatever.
730641	735842	Now, the cool thing... You tried a video chat with me, and it was pretty blurry.
736823	742625	But what's interesting is that another podcaster, our old buddy Bobby, sent a picture of his kitty cat
743741	747064	Like, because you can send pictures on Xbox Live instead of messages if you want.
747344	749687	And I got a picture of his kitty cat and it was pretty clear.
749707	754431	It was a little dark, like there was some contrast issues, but he probably just didn't have the right lighting behind it.
755132	758876	Most of our houses aren't set up to have lighting behind where our systems are at.
759176	761457	You know, at least in this house, I know the lighting is like by the couch.
761477	763038	That's probably why he has the contrast issues.
763518	766919	But it was sharp, unlike when we video chatted.
767139	767740	Well, here's the thing.
767760	772541	The video chat's only in 640 by 480, whereas the pictures are 1.3 megapixels.
772581	773882	So that's, you know, the difference.
774342	779424	So, yeah, it looks all blurry, but then when you take a picture, it's just, you know, supposed to be clear.
779804	783806	Except for your gamer tag pictures, those are still blurry as hell.
783846	786487	Because I took one, I'm like, wow, I can't see anything in that.
787113	793617	Then how come some of the other, like I have three other podcasters on my list who got the camera early because Microsoft likes them.
793637	794198	I don't know.
794338	795919	And they all look fine.
797020	797620	I don't get it.
797820	798701	But here's the thing.
799381	800022	I say take it back.
801443	802203	It's not my face.
802463	803164	I'm not blurry.
804225	806706	I think that's what SSJ100Matt in chat says.
806726	807747	Maybe it's your face, Loki.
807847	809728	Yeah, and here's the other thing.
810069	811309	Thank you, Microsoft.
812730	815672	This camera is made for cyber sex.
818223	820924	I showed Rob why this camera is made for cyber sex.
820964	821865	It's very disturbing.
822605	823906	And I never want to see it again.
825247	834272	For some reason, a feature that was added into the video chat on live, and explain to me why you would need this.
835753	842977	If you push the trigger buttons on your controller, it makes the other person's controller vibrate as long as you hold them down.
843996	848538	If that does not scream video or cyber sex, I don't know what does.
850139	851140	Thank you, Microsoft.
851180	853461	You guys really thought of everything.
856502	859704	So, your vision camera, would I recommend buying it?
859844	860384	I don't know.
860545	866187	I mean, maybe the room I'm using in it, because I got the camera to look decent.
866227	873091	It was just very blurry still, but I mean, compared to the last digital camera that we had, the webcam, I guess it
874015	875036	I mean, I don't know.
876136	877696	I can't just get this thing to work anymore.
878157	879457	We'll try it on my Xbox when we're done.
879837	881518	See if maybe the different lighting in this house will help.
881838	882118	Maybe.
882238	883138	I don't know.
884099	885599	It's worth picking up if you can find one.
886279	891861	I know GameStop, at least where I got mine pre-ordered at, they didn't get any extras in.
892001	893342	So it might be pretty hard to find.
895062	897723	I'm not getting one.
897743	899224	You're not interested in the vision thing?
899824	899964	No.
900164	902525	You don't want the whole vibration with the controller thing?
903241	904661	It was kind of funny when he did it.
904942	905702	I was like, what the hell?
905722	906742	Why is the controller shaking?
907462	908442	And Loki's like, do you feel that?
908462	908982	Do you feel that?
910783	913344	I have a PC and I actually have a real webcam.
914244	916964	Which nobody is giving the address to since I don't upload it to anywhere.
917224	921245	But you can't play Uno with a webcam on the PC.
921265	922946	At least I don't know any versions of it yet.
923066	924706	I don't touch our Xbox 360.
926327	927107	What about Dead Rising?
927667	929407	Okay, I played that, but that was the last thing I played.
930428	931828	Because it was all about zombie killing.
933257	936458	I've been sort of not playing the 360.
936598	938679	No interest in Totem Ball or anything?
940519	940899	Pinball.
941180	941500	I don't know.
941540	943940	I kind of want one, but it can also kind of wait.
944160	947541	I mean, it's not something... I think I'll support many games for it right now.
947601	953163	Yeah, I thought I would want it right away and I was kind of looking for one, but now I'm like, eh, do I really need to video chat?
953363	953703	I don't know.
954383	956064	It can wait, especially after seeing Loki's.
956284	956564	We'll see.
957834	958814	Let's see, my gaming week.
959614	960995	Actually not a lot of new stuff.
961495	963515	There really wasn't anything new I picked up this week.
963715	972137	I was interested in getting the camera at one point but I wasn't able to get it because I didn't pre-order one because I didn't think I would want it but then I was going to go look for it.
972357	972837	They didn't have it.
973417	982559	So I've pretty much just been watching a friend of mine play through Enchanted Arms because I showed it to a friend of mine and he's been in love with it and just over here playing it a lot.
984020	986240	He got further than I did so I think he's about
986820	1015236	I think the percentage said he was like 46% of the way through the game so some of the voice acting gets a little better when you get to midway some of the voice actors are pretty good and some are still pretty bad but the game's plot got interesting it's pretty fun I think if you're a role playing fan and you happen to have a 360 you should definitely check out Enchanted Arms because there's really not a lot else for you right now on the 360 and Enchanted Arms is decent it's not a hey we made this at the last minute so we could say we have an RPG on the system it's pretty good I was pretty happy
1016058	1018019	Drew Nami, how was your gaming week?
1019040	1020781	Oddly enough, I've been playing a lot of Rez.
1022162	1022482	Really?
1022862	1023402	Really, really.
1024383	1027185	Aside from that, I haven't been really playing that many games.
1027245	1032228	I took a break from WoW and... Oh yeah, I've been playing World of Warcraft a lot, actually.
1032408	1033208	I'm in a new guild.
1033228	1033528	Damn it.
1033789	1034089	Yeah.
1034789	1041053	So, my friend convinced me to join the gay guild on Proudmoore, so I've been playing there a lot.
1041613	1041973	It's fun.
1042414	1043054	Yeah, I took a break.
1043094	1044035	I'm a little bit burned out.
1044435	1044535	Um...
1045339	1048101	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1072338	1075779	What would you say to the people that say Kingdom Hearts 2 is nothing but a bunch of button mashing?
1076539	1079680	You haven't played it on proud mode, and you haven't gotten to Beast Castle Round 2.
1081721	1085202	As you said, I read some reviews that said... Even regular mode, the Demix battle.
1086182	1087843	Yeah, Demix is just a pain in the ass.
1087863	1088643	He's just a bitch.
1090424	1090704	Alright.
1091304	1095586	Well, let's go on to some housekeeping, and then we're going to... Oh, I want to mention one thing that I thought was pretty cool.
1095826	1100127	GameStop, when I went and picked up my camera, I just looked around a little bit to see if there was anything else I wanted...
1100683	1106607	I found a Beatmania 2DX turntable controller for $8.
1107348	1108208	Pick that sucker up.
1108329	1109049	And now it's mine.
1109850	1112612	Well, at least I'm babysitting it for a little while because Loki hates Beatmania.
1112812	1114733	Well, I just don't have any games.
1115714	1118516	At the time, I didn't have my PlayStation 2 back, but I finally got it back.
1119156	1120517	Do you have USB Mania?
1120537	1120737	No.
1120757	1121278	You can borrow that?
1121638	1126482	If you want, you can borrow my Japanese PlayStation and the various styles I own.
1126602	1127222	I don't own them all.
1127242	1128183	I've got my HD letter.
1128203	1129164	I'll just load the Japanese.
1129244	1129664	Oh, well.
1130383	1133406	I'll put the new 2DX that they have in Japan over there on it.
1133807	1134427	Alright, well.
1134447	1136950	Excuse me for trying to do something nice.
1136970	1139412	I'll just leave the controller here because I don't really play 2DX.
1139432	1141014	I'm going to play Doubles.
1141354	1142716	I'm going to get back into 2DX and play Doubles.
1142736	1144477	Because Doubles Keyboard Mania was a blast.
1144638	1147821	And when you could play that in the arcade, people were like, WTF?
1147841	1148982	So many buttons.
1149002	1149783	Watching someone do 7-star.
1154961	1156262	Yeah, I was never as good.
1156342	1159065	I mean, I could get through a couple double songs, you know.
1159145	1160026	I was pretty decent.
1160086	1162348	I could do three stars, that was it, in doubles.
1162648	1165151	Who was that guy that is so good at keyboard mania?
1165191	1165511	Blue?
1165871	1166312	Is that his name?
1166472	1166752	Yeah.
1166872	1173799	That guy, he can smoke those doubles that are like the maximum level, and I'll tell you what.
1174319	1175781	I loved watching him play keyboard mania, though.
1176061	1176922	That gives me...
1178556	1182158	A gamer boner so much more than the 2DX and pop music videos.
1182178	1183318	He also plays piano very well.
1183378	1185519	Yeah, because I like the piano music a lot more.
1185579	1189041	I mean, I'm not disrespecting the 2DX because there's a lot of impressive stuff there.
1189061	1192262	You should also see him play Pump It Up.
1192282	1193843	You should also see him do doubles on Pump It Up.
1194243	1194483	All right.
1195804	1196484	Someday, someday.
1197305	1197825	Housekeeping.
1197965	1204548	First, we want to thank everybody for all the well wishes for episode 200 because we continue to kind of get them throughout the week, even after the show.
1204608	1206789	I got a couple messages on Xbox Live, which is very nice.
1207313	1235884	and I know we got some emails and some message board posts so we just wanted to say thank you guys and it was a fun show it was a long show but it was a fun show and really glad you guys that were able to join us live did or if you couldn't join us live we're glad you got through all three parts so thank you also wanted to say the DDR sneak peeks are continuing tonight those haven't stopped they'll be a little later on in this program four new tracks two from Ultramix 4 and two from Universe and also I wanted to say about this podcast
1236792	1239794	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1266051	1273774	is he set up a program that not only catches podcasts and automatically shares them over the network to your Xbox 360.
1273814	1276095	It doesn't put them on the hard drive of the Xbox 360.
1276135	1276875	It uses the network.
1277235	1280396	But what it also does is it downloads RSS feeds.
1280496	1282457	Like let's say you want to read, I don't know, Kotaku.
1282737	1289819	Let's say you have Kotaku in your feed, and what it does is it translates the text of the RSS feed and makes it an image.
1290600	1294681	And then so if you go through your photo gallery on Xbox 360, you can read RSS feeds.
1295216	1295516	XBeeStream.com
1325575	1327076	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1355424	1356585	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1376673	1378815	Now we shall go into some news, shall we Jamie?
1378835	1379575	Sure, why don't we?
1379595	1381217	Well, you know, I always shake my head because, you know what I call him?
1381237	1381817	I call him Ken Crayon Eater.
1405319	1412063	So apparently the price of the PlayStation 3 in Japan has been dropped.
1414204	1429391	Even though they're still having the delays with their production, they're stating that they're going to reprice the 20 gigabyte model with an inclusion of the HDMI port for 49,980 yen, which is roughly 48 bucks in the U.S.,
1435131	1441154	about 225 pounds in the UK, which is actually a reduction from 62,790 yen.
1441174	1446797	So that's a pretty significant drop, at least, you know, a couple hundred.
1448198	1454562	So they're also saying that at the Tokyo Game Show there were going to be 200 playable consoles.
1455022	1459224	What I haven't found out is if they are actually still those rack-mounted servers.
1460265	1460705	Yes, they are.
1461305	1462366	See, I'm not surprised.
1463109	1475838	Now, one thing that was mentioned, and I found out after reading the article, a bit of a rebuttal on this, is that they're saying that the online service was going to offer Mega Drive and PC Engine titles, but Sega had something different to say about that, didn't they?
1477259	1477920	Yes, they did.
1478000	1486926	They said that it was something that they were considering based on the architecture of the online system, but it wasn't something that they were doing right away.
1487387	1489348	More proof that Ken Kurogi eats crayons.
1490616	1493559	However, one thing I do think is kind of cool is their global mapping system.
1494540	1502486	Basically, what it does is you upload your pictures, data about where you live, and it makes a world map where various PS3 gamers live.
1502947	1505389	It's kind of neat.
1505789	1507531	So it's like that one site.
1507571	1509512	What is that site?
1509893	1510373	Frapper.
1510393	1510733	Thank you.
1510793	1511094	Frapper.
1511134	1511674	It's like a Frapper.
1511694	1513195	Because we have an Orange Lounge Radio Frapper.
1513696	1515337	And you should join that if you haven't already.
1515397	1517399	But yeah, it sounds like Frapper for your PS3.
1517619	1518600	I'm getting that impression.
1520131	1524076	But I still think that he needs to keep the bicycle helmet on a little bit longer.
1525018	1526840	His head hasn't quite healed from that last falling.
1528283	1530025	He's still got the baby soft spot.
1530406	1531648	Yeah.
1531708	1533530	His skull hasn't completely molded together.
1533671	1534572	You guys are crazy.
1536614	1546382	It's interesting because I'm reading about the XB Stream stuff in chat because apparently some of the other podcasters who were affected by that whole thing were very vocal about it and some of our folks listen to other podcasts.
1546682	1555229	I do try to listen to other podcasts, but ever since my iPod broke last week, it's been very hard for me to listen to other podcasts, so I'm kind of behind on all the gossip on XB Stream.
1556310	1558492	But they're saying, let's see, they said here,
1559255	1589004	something about GamerAndy loves XBStream I think there's a hint of sarcasm there Funnydale says XBStream nearly shut down IGN I'm not kidding and then Funnydale goes on to say wait shut down IGN on second thought I love XBStream but BlackWolf says reminds us that Tigerclaw or was saying to Tigerclaw I guess in a message here he offered to compensate for the bandwidth bills the author was like so you know oops I really made a big big mistake I'll pay for the bills I thought that was kind of nice you know so
1590645	1595146	Anyway, moving on, I wanted to say really quickly regarding the PlayStation 3.
1596367	1606490	There's an interesting series that Kotaku's been running, because they have some folks over at the show, and they've been posting these videos on YouTube asking people, do you want to get the Wii or the PlayStation 3?
1607510	1612772	Not sure why they didn't include the Xbox 360, but whatever, I guess maybe they figured that, you know, Xbox 360 is...
1614150	1614570	and DarkSakura.
1639352	1641354	I'm not seeing that same correlation.
1641815	1645698	So what is it about Japan and their love for the PlayStation 3?
1646599	1649402	Is it the fact that Nintendo doesn't go to Tokyo Game Show?
1649442	1650243	I'll state the obvious there.
1650363	1659371	Is it maybe that people are just, you know, they're... Because the ooh and ahs of Sony being there, they're just loving that and that's kind of skewing their view a little bit, or what?
1659892	1663816	I think my old theory stands is it has to do with getting...
1665006	1665606	a Blu-ray.
1665866	1670027	I mean, honestly, I think that the Japanese market is looking at the whole Blu-ray thing as a positive.
1670047	1679230	I mean, having a DVD player in it is what sold the PS2 because at the time it was a lot cheaper to get a PS2 than to go out and just buy a DVD player.
1680931	1683431	I think that they're looking for that multiple functionality.
1683451	1684852	Interesting.
1685112	1685492	Interesting.
1690343	1703694	Fireboma says Tokyo Game Show is mostly fanboys Nintendo wasn't at Tokyo Game Show so their fans weren't there Nintendo Maniac 64 says the poll was probably done that way probably because the 360 is already out
1704355	1707397	So, okay, that makes sense why they didn't include 360 in the poll.
1707818	1717865	But what about some of those, well, I don't know, I can't remember if we get into it later in the program, but I'll just quickly say, what about some of those 360 games that are being shown at Tokyo Game Show?
1717945	1721668	I mean, do you think that this might sway the Japanese public at all?
1721708	1726412	I mean, I was watching the demo for Blue Dragon, some of the gameplay video, it looked pretty hot.
1726932	1729975	So, I don't know, is it going to be enough, or is it too little too late?
1731176	1731696	I guess we'll see.
1731716	1732116	I don't know.
1732817	1733077	All right.
1735808	1744858	Well, as far as the PS3 itself, you know, where they were going to have the price drop in Japan, we are not quite so lucky here.
1746120	1752107	There's basically stating that there is no plans to drop the price in the United States.
1752607	1754609	It's still going to be $499 for the low end, $599 for the 60 gig version.
1758264	1764090	There hasn't been any set word if it's going to apply to Europe as well.
1765050	1767773	And they're still set for a 2007 launch in March.
1769574	1770355	Pretty interesting.
1770535	1772617	A lot of that might have to do with how it works here.
1773638	1776000	Do you think if we have a crappy launch here in the U.S.
1776481	1781205	that Europe might get the price drop as incentive for them to go buy them?
1781647	1783951	It's possible, but that's not really how Sony plays.
1784172	1784993	Yeah, I know.
1785274	1789041	One other thing, though, is that we are getting the HDMI slot on the low-end system.
1790421	1790941	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1812739	1813059	and DarkSakura.
1837759	1842422	or maybe you do because it's actually a game that's already on the web for free.
1843262	1845523	Kind of funny because they're trying to sell the game.
1846244	1847765	Not to say that it's a bad game.
1847805	1850486	It's actually a pretty fun game and you can check it out online.
1851927	1853248	Just do a search for Flow.
1853288	1854769	It's a pretty cool little thing.
1854789	1855489	They were talking about
1856249	1857650	It was actually kind of an experiment.
1858130	1863574	You know, if I do a search for Flow, I might get a lot of websites that aren't related to gaming at all.
1864034	1867256	So perhaps you might want to specify that search a little more.
1867777	1868137	Okay.
1868457	1872960	Well, if you want to play Flow in the wonderful Flash version, you can do so.
1873641	1876503	There's a couple different places to check it out.
1876683	1877664	The first one's going to be...
1879256	1892822	at inti.usc.edu slash cloud slash flowing slash core.html.
1893142	1894863	So I hope you got a pen and paper for that one.
1895283	1897084	If not, rewind the show and write faster.
1897184	1897744	Exactly.
1898744	1906728	Although, if you're looking for an easier way to actually play this, you can download copies, and I believe that there's one that's mirrored on PSP Updates.
1907677	1909719	or PS3 updates, I would imagine.
1910439	1922930	But anyways, so yeah, this game is going to be downloadable and supposedly you're going to have to purchase this, which is kind of funny because isn't this going to have a browser in it anyway?
1922990	1926292	So couldn't you, I don't know, go browse over to this website and play it for free?
1927073	1931717	I mean, that seems kind of retarded to me that you would be able to, I don't know,
1933405	1936386	Download this for free instead of paying for Sony's service.
1936426	1941448	That kind of defeats the purpose of... Well, what about all those Geometry Wars clones when they were out there?
1941528	1945890	You know, you could play it for free, quote-unquote, online or on the other platforms.
1945910	1948671	Yeah, but you can't play it for free on the PlayStation 3.
1950092	1954834	See, you can actually go with... Well, but you can't play Geometry Wars for free on the Xbox.
1954934	1956134	On the Xbox 360, that's what I'm saying.
1956314	1957535	But you can...
1958378	1970043	with the PlayStation 3, web browse over to this site and either download it to your hard drive and run it in Linux, or you could, I don't know, play it in the web browser, assuming that this thing supports Flash.
1970143	1975845	I would hope so, since it's a next-gen console with the fucking cell processor, it should be able to support Flash.
1977206	1978486	So yeah, you could play this game.
1979387	1982068	Ota G says, but, but, but, it's in HD!
1983268	1984509	But, but, but, who cares?
1987116	1990639	It's going to be in HD anyways, because it's going to be on your TV.
1991760	1992080	I don't know.
1992340	1993481	I just think it's a waste of money.
1994082	1994342	All right.
1994362	2001688	Well, this was certainly a controversial story in the scene this week regarding the PlayStation 3, and it has to do with Gran Turismo HD.
2002779	2011148	And now there's these stories that have been going around about the fact that there's going to be this Gran Turismo HD Classic that's going to be, you know, kind of the entry into the GT series.
2011569	2018176	And then there's going to be, I guess, 750 cars that you can download online for between 50 cents a dollar apiece.
2018256	2020639	It's basically every... And there's 50 tracks between $1.50 and $4.50 apiece.
2020659	2021200	They're all the...
2023601	2027862	All the cars that have been basically created for the Gran Turismo series for the last 10 years.
2028042	2031543	But Gran Turismo HD Premium will come with 2 courses and 30 cars.
2032103	2032383	Yes.
2032644	2038985	The Premium is going to be basically kind of a test model for Gran Turismo 5.
2039725	2042946	It's basically really detailed looking cars.
2043206	2045127	Think like Forza or something like that.
2046011	2047832	and just really nice stuff.
2047932	2054116	The reason why they don't have 750 cars in the premium version is because they haven't had a chance to create the models for all the cars yet.
2054456	2063701	They're really hurrying to get this game pushed out, which screams flaws up the ass.
2064301	2072886	Basically, the classic version, I guess, is going to be an upscaled version of Gran Turismo 4 with all those wonderful cars to purchase.
2073615	2077556	So you're saying if I go to the store and buy this Gran Turismo Classic, I can't do anything with it?
2077616	2079676	Well, Classic and Premium are in one game.
2079956	2080656	Oh, okay.
2080756	2081596	It's different modes.
2081676	2082817	Oh, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.
2083017	2084737	Oh, I made it sound like it was two separate games.
2085057	2086597	No, it's just one game.
2086677	2087838	Okay, okay.
2087978	2097599	You will get some cars, but if you think about it, 30 cars and two tracks is a lot less than, say, 250 that I'm used to getting at the store for $49.99 for PlayStation 2.
2097639	2097759	Huh.
2097819	2098219	Interesting.
2098239	2098639	Interesting.
2102461	2105183	I don't know, what do you think about this microtransaction thing?
2105764	2106364	Well, here's the thing.
2106544	2108666	It doesn't stop at cars or tracks.
2109487	2113189	They're going to be adding parts and skins for your cars as well.
2113450	2115751	They want it to become the iTunes of Gran Turismo.
2116052	2121516	So you're going to be spending thousands of dollars, hopefully, on this crap for one game.
2122998	2138162	Well, I think about Test Drive Unlimited, which is something I've been playing a lot recently that also has a crap load of cars and a crap load of parts and things that you can get with it, but you unlock them naturally as you go to the in-game store.
2138182	2140023	None of this microtransaction crap.
2140063	2142303	You buy the game and all this stuff is included.
2142343	2145144	You unlock it within the game, and that's what we're all kind of used to.
2145364	2147145	And here's the other fun thing about this, too.
2147465	2148385	They were saying that...
2150123	2163815	A lot of the cars in this are going to be expensive because they want you to actually be, you know, just kind of having that, I guess, you know, other people have expensive cars.
2163835	2166097	Ooh, I've got to have that expensive car.
2166617	2168659	It's actually going to be expensive.
2169139	2171421	Do I get to buy horse armor for said car?
2172482	2174063	Well, if it were a horse, maybe.
2174584	2178347	But the whole thing screams to me as a bad idea.
2178917	2183979	I think a lot of people, I mean, they may be fans of Gran Turismo, but who's really going to pay for all the cars?
2184359	2188981	I mean, that's just like saying, oh, here's Madden NFL.
2189241	2192063	By the way, there's no teams or arenas included.
2192083	2193643	You have to purchase those separately.
2194544	2196564	Oh, by the way, the football's not included either.
2197045	2203407	You know, it's like buying a car without tires or an engine or seats or a body.
2203587	2205028	I mean, it's retarded.
2205608	2207349	So what exactly am I paying for here?
2208240	2212061	TigerKalon's chat says, maybe you end up buying rims and spinners for the cars.
2213481	2215862	And that's the other thing, too, about these cars.
2216762	2219463	Haz says, I want to buy a pine air freshener for my car.
2220523	2227105	Little fuzzy dice that can hang from the... I mean, why would you spend all this money on this?
2227805	2228045	I mean...
2231095	2232736	I really don't see people doing this.
2232756	2239821	I mean, because I know they're really trying to push this microtransaction thing, and if it goes well, you can better believe that Gran Turismo 5 is going to be the same thing.
2240181	2247065	Is there a possibility here that this whole thing's being grossly misinterpreted or something's wrong here?
2247325	2250087	Because I know on the internet this week, it was a little bit back and forth.
2250167	2250928	Rumor, not rumor.
2250988	2257552	I've read a couple interviews, actually, with the head people for the lead on...
2259506	2261108	And they've confirmed this stuff.
2261188	2269917	Now, the thing they haven't confirmed, they didn't say anything about the pricing on this and whether, you know, a lot of people aren't probably going to be buying 750 cars.
2269937	2270478	That's, you know, a fact.
2272864	2285715	But they didn't mention, you know, well, are there, you know, if I purchase, you know, say, a Honda Civic or something, and someone purchases a Lamborghini, I mean, am I going to have to purchase a, you know, more expensive car to be able to race against these people?
2285735	2289418	Because they're going to be smoking me in this, you know, souped up car.
2289478	2299527	So, I think the whole thing's a bad idea, and I know there's been a lot of comparisons to Project Gotham Racing 3, but I kind of find it a little bit, you know,
2300037	2302499	That game does actually come with cars and tracks.
2302579	2307381	In fact, I think quite an unlimited amount of tracks since you can create your own courses in there.
2307862	2312865	But the fact is, I don't have to purchase these cars in order to be able to enjoy the game.
2313265	2319429	Whereas if I want to play the online version of Classic, yes, you do have to purchase those cars, and yes, you do have to purchase those tracks.
2319889	2324772	So I think it's kind of retarded that I should have to spend money on a game that I already spent money on.
2325839	2326239	Interesting.
2326299	2327540	More interesting comments from chat.
2327560	2328381	They're just lit up on this.
2328701	2334885	Funnydale says, Sony is going to make players of Gran Turismo HD pay $5 a gallon for virtual gasoline.
2335185	2337126	PlayStation 3, this is really living.
2339208	2339468	Funny.
2340168	2343170	Stickaxe, you know, a little bit of a counterpoint here.
2343711	2349674	If the game was cheap, and if I only like a few tracks, I don't have to spend $40 for a game I only want half of.
2351436	2351696	True.
2351976	2352056	And
2352850	2361133	And the whole thing is, you know, the Gran Turismo HD Premium or whatever, it's just a fucking demo for Gran Turismo 5 is basically what it is.
2361793	2369436	You know, why should I pay for an upscaled version of 4, seeing as you can buy 4 and upscale it anyways, you know, ver-
2370303	2370863	Why the hell?
2371264	2375346	Well, first off, if I were ever to buy a PlayStation 3, I would never be buying this game at all.
2375506	2377747	I mean, I would not touch this game with a 10-foot pole.
2378287	2381209	I would wait for a better racing game to come out, because you know what?
2381229	2383010	There's going to be a lot more out there.
2383490	2389353	The only way I could ever see this selling is if it were like $10 for the core of it, and then everything else you can pay for.
2389933	2395116	If it were like, you know, you can buy 200 cars for $20 or something like that, then maybe, yeah.
2395552	2396533	Project Gotham 3 Car Packets
2413399	2414580	Project Gossam
2437672	2439134	Project Gotham 3 packs.
2439215	2442660	Is it because Project Gotham 3 actually is a full game without them?
2442800	2443741	Yeah, it's a full game.
2443781	2447547	You do not need to have these cars in order to enjoy the game.
2448648	2449730	It's kind of an added bonus.
2449770	2452594	If you want to buy the cars, then yeah, you can go ahead and do that.
2453177	2454598	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2476997	2480439	All right, we're going to leave with a couple chat comments here, and then we'll move on here.
2480679	2482539	Gita in chat says, I don't really care.
2482760	2484160	Waiting for Need for Speed Carbon.
2484740	2487361	And NintendoManiac64 says, Excite Truck for the win.
2488142	2490923	So, sounds like some people are just going to take their money elsewhere.
2491003	2491423	We'll see.
2492304	2492924	Well, anyways.
2495065	2502608	There's actually some interesting stuff coming out other than Gran Turismo HD, and that is our favorite game to talk about, Africa.
2503895	2505757	What the hell is Africa?
2506157	2509739	Well, that's kind of funny because it's actually kind of what we thought it would be.
2510040	2515704	It's basically a virtual African safari where you can take pictures and basically keep them.
2517005	2518666	It's Pokemon Snap with giraffes.
2519026	2523450	Exactly, but it's not really a game though.
2524230	2529274	It's basically a virtual safari, virtual Africa where you get to see animals.
2529881	2533085	and basically experience Africa without going to Africa.
2533205	2535689	Did Elton John do the music and Tim Rice the lyrics?
2536289	2536690	I don't know.
2536810	2537211	Don't care.
2537311	2537811	You know what?
2538252	2540435	I like Jumbo Safari because you can harpoon animals.
2541377	2542037	Jumbo Safari Jumbo Safari
2564747	2567969	In studio, I have the trailer running right now for Africa.
2568329	2570390	And granted, it looks fucking amazing.
2570730	2571491	Yeah, it's pretty.
2571851	2575613	It's very pretty, but the thing is, it's like, what the hell is this?
2575733	2577874	I mean, it's just, okay, it's Africa.
2579455	2580876	There's grass.
2581056	2581737	It's the Barons.
2582537	2583838	And there's birds and stuff.
2584118	2584938	I'm Chuck Norris.
2585419	2587480	Yes, it's the Barons without Chuck Norris jokes.
2587520	2588140	What more do you need?
2588500	2590121	So granted, okay, great.
2590201	2590762	It's elephants.
2590862	2592843	It's the Discovery Channel, you know.
2593777	2597380	That's basically kind of what it seems to me to be, but I don't know.
2597420	2601602	Do we really want, you know, do you really need to like buy this stuff?
2602563	2604224	Here's the game I would recommend buying.
2604444	2606105	Cabela's African Safari.
2606125	2609388	You get to go destroy, you know, elephants and rhinos and stuff.
2609408	2610829	Can you see like the predators eat other animals?
2611109	2613270	Yes, they have cheetahs and stuff.
2613370	2619034	I want to see like the whole true circle of life where like they eat animals.
2619094	2619635	Ooh, hyenas.
2620575	2621396	It's Africa...
2621803	2623484	And look at their eating animals.
2623504	2626126	Look at the cute hyena eating the carcass.
2627747	2629568	And then suddenly out of nowhere, Crikey!
2629748	2631289	Oh wait, bad taste, sorry, bad taste.
2631349	2632470	A stingray through my heart!
2633330	2633870	Bad taste.
2634111	2635812	Oh, the hippo wiggling his little ears.
2635832	2636952	I mean, it looks great.
2636992	2638854	I mean, this looks really, really good.
2638974	2642816	It's just, I think that, you know, they should do... Yeah, but maybe this is just the opening movie.
2642876	2644757	Like, how often do we get pissed off at that?
2645137	2649260	Like, you know, you see the opening movie, and then, like, the game looks nothing like it.
2649482	2649962	You know what I mean?
2650162	2653624	Oh, you mean like, kind of like, uh, oh, I don't know, Motorstorm?
2654864	2655765	Ooh, pretty.
2656025	2663568	So, so granted, okay, this is, you know, really cool and stuff, but I don't know, I don't know if this- It does look amazing.
2663988	2666349	I mean, graphically, it's, but yeah, what the hell is it?
2666369	2668970	It's like, I don't need tech demos as a fucking game.
2670911	2672171	Yeah, you're the same- Wait a minute.
2672191	2673672	They cut it off before he ate the gazelle.
2673872	2677473	Aren't you the same person that said you were wanting to get a copy of Wii Play from Japan?
2677493	2678133	Yeah, because that's fun.
2678154	2679294	I don't want tech demos as a game.
2680595	2685297	Yeah, tech demos as in like, okay, here's ducks, okay, and look at the ducks.
2686978	2688419	Oh my god, Jeremy Todd 1 is great.
2688799	2689259	What'd he say?
2689780	2694122	In Africa, you will be able to hunt down your favorite species of rare animals and take pictures of them.
2694522	2699845	On rare nights, usually nights with a full moon, you will be able to see Chuck Norris running around killing elephants with his bare hands.
2700245	2701846	Take a picture for massive damage.
2704327	2705108	That was beautiful.
2705548	2706068	That's great.
2706088	2707329	You win the chatroom cookie.
2708209	2709690	Well, like I said, you know,
2712693	2713554	It's a nice game.
2714434	2718016	I hope that there's more to it than just look at the pretty animals.
2718336	2720157	Well, I don't know.
2720317	2723259	I sort of think that I would play that.
2723459	2727160	But then again, I also did play a whole bunch of Pokemon Snap.
2727701	2733043	But something that I will play, because I'm probably going to get a PS3, is Ninja Gaiden.
2733324	2734084	Ninja Gaiden.
2735137	2745422	Coming out on PS3, according to Famitsu, there is going to be one called Ninja Gaiden Sigma, which you will play as Rachel from Ninja Gaiden Black.
2748463	2755486	And it was actually also revealed that Itagaki was saying that there was going to be a Ninja Gaiden 2 version,
2756461	2759364	It wasn't stating that it was the same project.
2760765	2766549	There's also a theory that this is going to be a remake of Ninja Gaiden Black with extras.
2767870	2774116	And there's also been no statement on if it's going to be specific just to the PS3 or if it will see multiple systems.
2774196	2775437	I think it'll see multiple systems.
2777418	2777959	Probably.
2777979	2785084	Because I know Ninja Gaiden Black did really well on the Xbox, so I wouldn't see why they wouldn't try to make a 360 version
2786089	2788611	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2812788	2817172	I like the demo thing because they did it during E3 and got some pretty good demos from that.
2817252	2820394	Hopefully you're going to see some more stuff as far as demos go.
2820434	2825298	I know that their Sonic the Hedgehog is supposed to be next week at some point so that would be cool.
2826119	2830142	Maybe even some more Japanese exclusive demos would be nice because I get to play those anyways.
2832104	2833645	Just stuff like that.
2835126	2839550	I like how they're doing this and hopefully we'll see some more stuff that come out pretty soon.
2840731	2851437	Well, as far as things that are coming out relatively soon, at the Tokyo Game Show, Microsoft had a press release stating what new live arcade games were going to be coming out.
2852097	2859461	Included were Contra, Gyruss, Dig Dug, Track and Field, New Rally X, Russian Attack, Ms.
2859481	2863022	Pac-Man, and exclusive for the Japanese audience, Yaya Kung Fu.
2865324	2865804	That's pretty cool.
2866431	2869932	I wonder if I can play that since I have my Japanese account, you know.
2870232	2870772	Don't bother.
2871352	2872372	I don't like Yarkung Fu.
2872412	2874453	I know a lot of people have a lot of love for that game.
2874673	2878293	I don't think it's this amazing fighting game people make it out to be.
2879294	2881494	It's what practically started the genre.
2883094	2883595	I'll try it.
2883955	2884275	I don't know.
2884495	2885075	Not my favorite.
2885135	2889856	Because, you know, they do have the free demo versions you can try out.
2890196	2892136	Gyrus, on the other hand, bring it.
2892696	2893617	Freaking love Gyrus.
2893717	2895557	I'm so there when Gyrus comes out.
2896499	2902783	Now some interesting things were found out actually this week, or at least have been brought to light.
2903303	2911789	The fact that you can download or copy your Xbox Live arcade games onto a CD-R or DVD-R and be able to play them on your system.
2912229	2913209	Now why is this important?
2913269	2917272	Well, not everyone out there has a hard drive for their system, as much as I'd like to think so.
2918656	2922018	and also that the memory units are quite limited on what you can put on there.
2922358	2928383	Now there's a big huge kind of how-to on 360gamesaves.com if you want to know how to do this.
2928983	2937090	And it's kind of funny, this is one of the things that they actually have been able to do is pull off the full version of Hexic HD.
2937150	2940252	So if you don't have a hard drive, you can actually play it on your system.
2940792	2946517	And it's basically as simple as bringing them into a certain directory structure on your PC
2948187	2954912	and basically popping it in and they will populate your Xbox Live Arcade list there, which is pretty cool.
2955292	2960356	And if you do have them registered on your system, they will be the full version, otherwise they are a demo.
2962717	2964399	So when might somebody want to actually use this?
2966060	2974126	If they don't have a hard drive or if they're just stuck to just a simple memory unit, they might, I don't know, if they have the extra...
2974960	2975521	and DarkSakura.com
2991300	2999802	does the kind of not legit thing and takes all the demos and puts them on a disk image and, you know, distributes that over the internet, which would be cool.
3000082	3015646	And I think that should be something that Microsoft should do anyways, because I know that, well, I know they were trying to push their Xbox Live Arcade Unplugged, but, you know, this way, if you could download all the demos, say, to a disk image, kind of like how they have the backwards compatibility updates, that would be pretty cool as well.
3015666	3020967	And you just burn it onto the disk and then pop it in there and you have all the demos for all the games and then you can just, you know,
3021789	3023150	Register them, I guess, somehow.
3024210	3026032	That's kind of a problem if you don't have live, I guess.
3027312	3028873	And how is piracy going to be prevented again?
3030074	3038679	The way piracy is prevented on it is actually that you're not going to be able to... The games are only demo versions unless it's registered to your account.
3039240	3039580	Interesting.
3040300	3046404	Oh, yeah, because sometimes I start up Geometry Wars and it looks like it's a demo and then suddenly it switches over and it says, oh, never mind, it's a demo version.
3046444	3049506	Yeah, because whether they're registered or not is based on your account.
3049966	3051547	You can't just download a registered version.
3053208	3057189	All right, well, speaking of the 360, we have a very exciting announcement for the 360.
3057789	3062030	At least I know a lot of our import game fans are going to love this because these were huge games.
3062050	3065190	Well, they were released here too, but it seems to appeal to that same audience.
3065951	3068451	Radiant Silvergun and Ikaruga.
3068811	3070732	You might recognize these two shooter titles.
3071112	3075792	Well, did you know that this was always planned to be a trilogy?
3077013	3077853	And guess what?
3077913	3078313	Treasure...
3079348	3084670	has announced that they will be making a third game in the series for the Xbox 360.
3085330	3085910	That's all we know.
3085930	3086590	Treasure loves us.
3086870	3087610	That's all we know.
3087650	3091111	We don't know when, where, how, what.
3091351	3094192	We just know that Treasure's making it, and it's coming to the 360.
3094912	3097213	Dude, I love Radiant Silvergun so much.
3097513	3099213	So now will you play your 360, Jamie?
3099594	3100014	Yes!
3100354	3101074	Oh my god!
3102236	3107540	I played the hell out of Radiant Silvergun at that one arcade in Las Vegas before they shut down.
3108340	3109581	I was like, Radiant Silvergun?
3109841	3111583	Everyone else is off playing Mambo at GoGo.
3111783	3112803	I'm like, screw that.
3113764	3114345	Radiant Silvergun?
3114725	3115665	They couldn't get me off the machine.
3115946	3125632	What's interesting about that, I think, is that those games are usually very vertical in nature, yet now the Xbox 360 supports widescreen and all their games have to support widescreen.
3126013	3130636	So it's going to be interesting what all that new horizontalness does to the game, don't you think?
3131258	3135101	I actually am sort of foreseeing something like, what was it, Thunder Force 5?
3135441	3140204	Didn't that one have a lot of the rotational, where it would go one way and then rotate the other way?
3141185	3143367	Maybe it wasn't Thunder Force 5, maybe I'm thinking of Einhander.
3144447	3148030	Einhander did a lot of vertical and horizontal scrolling in their games.
3148410	3149631	And Salamander.
3149831	3151252	Salamander actually did both, too.
3151652	3152973	They need to make a new Einhander.
3153434	3154014	It's about time.
3154174	3155435	If they do it, it'd be Zweihander.
3155455	3156576	Yeah.
3157737	3157877	Anyway.
3157917	3158017	Okay.
3159258	3161280	So, how about some release dates, y'all?
3161801	3166185	Well, of course, we will start off with our UK release dates.
3166826	3168708	Some okay stuff, I guess.
3169548	3176996	You know, it would help if my laptop wouldn't come unplugged when I'm trying to pull up the dates.
3177998	3180699	Sorry guys, I just got a little bit of a hang up.
3181100	3182300	Yeah, the internet's acting funny tonight.
3182320	3183821	Our chat room's all crazy tonight.
3184201	3185722	Live radio, folks.
3185842	3187643	The internet's not acting funny for me.
3188323	3191545	The fact that my computer came unplugged and my battery was going WTF.
3192725	3195406	Okay, so how about our UK release dates?
3195767	3196167	Take two.
3197407	3205411	On the 25th, which it probably already is in the UK, Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2 March of the Minis coming out.
3205651	3205892	On the 29th,
3208499	3235064	42 all-time classics coming out on the DS, Age of Empires, Age of Kings, Black Buccaneer on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation 2, Company of Heroes on PC, Devil May Cry 3, Dante's Awakening, Special Edition, that's a cool game, guys, get it, Infrared, and Kingdom Hearts 2 coming out on PlayStation 2, Mercury Meltdown also on the 30th, Mad Tracks coming out on Xbox 360.
3236244	3236624	Excellent.
3237473	3239154	There's some pretty cool stuff coming out.
3239534	3241895	I hope Bad Trax is coming out, because that'd be pretty awesome.
3241935	3243316	I want to play that.
3244717	3255562	For, of course, I've got to mention this first, the big game for the PlayStation 2 this week, Dance Dance Revolution Supernova, of course, will be coming out.
3256562	3258944	I have heard, though, that the bundle might be delayed.
3259044	3264186	So if you don't have a dance pad yet, which I don't see why you wouldn't, you might be waiting a little bit.
3265547	3265907	Of course,
3266773	3274115	On the PlayStation 2, we also have, or actually PlayStation 2, Xbox, the 360, and PSP, NBA Live 07.
3274455	3279517	And then if you're not a fan of Live, NBA 2K7 is coming out on PlayStation 2, Xbox, and the 360.
3279937	3285779	If you're not a fan of basketball, maybe you're a fan of racing games, in which case you've got a couple things.
3285879	3290580	The first one's going to be the Fast and the Furious on PlayStation 2, loosely based on Tokyo Drift.
3291380	3295582	And Import Tuner Challenge on the Xbox 360.
3297661	3300883	which there was a rumor that that was going to be $29.99 at Best Buy.
3301503	3303365	That is a typo.
3304125	3312350	Then, of course, Just Cause will be coming out on Xbox 360, the Xbox and PlayStation 2, as well as the PC.
3313991	3315272	And some other fun stuff.
3315312	3324217	On the GameCube, Beiten and Kato's Origins will be coming out, one of the last role-playing games actually made by Nintendo for the GameCube, so check that out.
3324757	3325418	As well as...
3326502	3333927	The Game Boy Advance will be getting some re-releases, including Pokemon FireRed as part of the greatest hits, and LeafGreen.
3335468	3340211	And, of course, there's some pretty good stuff coming out.
3341612	3346415	Ford Boldmoves Street Racing, if you're a racing fan on the PlayStation 2, kind of a budget game.
3346796	3352519	And Greg Hastings Tournament Paintball Max, which the game is about a year old now, but still, you might want to play it.
3352960	3354641	And Valkyrie Profile 2, Symera.
3355620	3356200	on the PlayStation 2.
3383331	3385375	I just think that's funny, a game about an MMO
3393740	3394741	and the game Live Radio Kids.
3417311	3422153	as well as a generic fishing game on July 18th of 07.
3422533	3439720	GISH for the PSP is coming out February 28th of 07, as well as a Guilty Gear title for the PlayStation 2, entitled right now Guilty Gear Series, but I guess that's a working title for that, and that's coming out January 2nd, so look for those.
3440281	3444442	If you are in the market for some Xbox 360 games, there's been a few price drops.
3445343	3445623	Quick 4...
3446510	3447611	X-Men The Official Game of the Movie
3470427	3471788	Melgear Solid Portable Ops.
3472008	3477391	One of the cool things though that we probably won't ever see over here is going to be a Portable Ops bundle for the PSP.
3478131	3486776	Because they're really trying to sell the PSP since they're getting their asses handed to them by Nintendo with the DS.
3487096	3499243	The wonderful little bundle is going to include a snakeskin patterned case as well as the game and a fun little box that comes
3499659	3500239	with everything.
3500319	3505981	So if you haven't gotten a PSP already and you're thinking about doing so, definitely check it out.
3506441	3509062	Comes with a box of cigarettes and Snake's favorite brand?
3509522	3509662	No.
3509863	3510043	Yeah.
3510343	3518045	Well, actually, it does come with an additional pouch with the, looks like the logo for the game on it as well.
3518445	3526188	But other than that, no real additional bonuses to it other than kind of a cool-looking PSP box.
3526568	3528589	Airsoft sniper rifle, you know.
3529944	3538746	Anyway, well, speaking of very cool things, Guitar Hero is going to be making it to multiple formats in 2007.
3538806	3544427	So that means that y'all who missed out are going to be having your second chance.
3545487	3556729	It has been announced by the chairman of Activision that, and this is a quote, that it will appear on every significant new format.
3558045	3566274	while also going into some of the information about their general plan from what it looks like as far as some of their other titles.
3569057	3576746	There hasn't been an official comment by Red Octane, but they did say 2007, and also Guitar Hero 2 is supposed to be out in November.
3577611	3579713	Doesn't that seem like a vague statement, though?
3579833	3581734	Every significant new platform?
3581934	3584276	I mean... Well, what's their idea of significant?
3584336	3584897	Exactly.
3585557	3587359	Maybe they like the Wonderswan.
3587699	3590321	Yeah, maybe they just mean it ain't coming for the Phantom.
3590421	3590681	Sorry.
3590781	3595585	Do not say hoo-hoo about the Wonderswan because it had the best home version of Beatmania.
3596186	3597727	Well, the best portable version of Beatmania.
3598708	3601770	Is this too much Guitar Hero?
3603291	3604933	Is this going to be an oversaturation of the market?
3605533	3605833	Nah.
3605853	3606754	Nah?
3607301	3607561	Yes.
3608222	3608442	Yes?
3608762	3610163	I just thought I'd say that.
3611064	3624215	I think so, because, I mean, really, it's gonna... I think Guitar Hero's gonna go the same path as Guitar Freaks, where, I mean, even though they still make tons of games for that, it's just, what are you gonna have?
3624275	3630580	You're not really gonna be able to innovate on the gameplay any, so it's just gonna be brand new music each time around.
3630700	3633163	And, I mean, well, I guess DDR... I mean, DDR does...
3634144	3634765	SoCalibur 2
3658821	3663602	is, you know, where Soul Calibur 2 had different special characters on each game.
3664022	3668143	They have a certain packet of songs on each game that's exclusive to just that one.
3668203	3668703	God, no.
3668743	3669743	Then I'd have to buy them all.
3671544	3672244	Don't do that.
3673244	3674985	Yeah, but wouldn't that sell more games?
3675625	3675965	I don't know.
3675985	3679706	I think, you know, really... I did own every version of Soul Calibur 2.
3680186	3686487	I want to see how well 2 does, because, I mean, 2... People are going to be having, you know, the buy 2, and they're going to be like,
3688223	3690825	They might just go, okay, I've seen this before.
3691545	3691925	Who knows?
3692325	3692765	I don't know.
3692825	3695307	I think it's got a huge enough fan base the game's going to do very well.
3695647	3697908	I think the game's going to do very, very well this Christmas.
3699128	3699549	What do I know?
3700509	3706592	I do know that an interesting story that somewhat relates to this is that a very interesting purchase has been made.
3707552	3711854	Of course, a while ago it kind of turned heads when Activision acquired Red Octane.
3711874	3713435	Well, now the other...
3714088	3715171	Harmonix, MTV Networks
3724392	3725413	Very interesting.
3725453	3734599	Yes, earlier this week, MTV announced a definitive agreement to acquire Harmonix Music Systems, developer of Guitar Hero, on behalf of MTV.
3734999	3740923	Under the terms of the transaction, MTV acquires all of the outstanding stock of Harmonix for $175 million in cash.
3741384	3749149	Harmonix shareholders may be eligible for incremental earn-out payments through 2008 to the extent that financial results exceed specific targets.
3750029	3753652	This is to demonstrate MTV's commitment to music and
3754178	3756419	You can play videos if you want to demonstrate that.
3756899	3763722	And furthers its strategy of engaging passionate music fans through a deep and immersive multi-platform entertainment experience.
3764122	3765642	Summary, we're screwed.
3766963	3772345	By the way, this means that MTV Games' logo will soon show up on Guitar Hero.
3772365	3773065	It should be interesting.
3774466	3777187	But could it allow them to get better licenses for the game?
3778732	3783635	Possibly, but I can't really see the game getting much better if MTV's label is slapped on it.
3783695	3785977	Could they finally get Metallica?
3787758	3788239	I don't know.
3788599	3791741	Metallica can be kind of, you know, pissy when it comes to their music.
3791781	3793582	They're totally... They're a little bit anal about their life.
3793602	3795063	However, they are now on iTunes.
3795143	3796704	They are the divas of rock.
3797605	3798245	Seriously.
3799346	3799646	Alright.
3802248	3803509	Anyways, um...
3804116	3804897	Elton John, Rocketman
3830612	3835376	for all those who want to do a wonderful impression of William Shatner.
3836337	3841381	DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, Summertime, which I think is pretty cool.
3842462	3843103	Blur Song 2.
3843223	3844484	Ooh, Blur.
3846125	3847286	Let's see here, some other good songs.
3847306	3850209	The resident Damon Auburn fangirl is going, whoo.
3850589	3852171	Scissor Sisters, Take Your Mama.
3852611	3853692	Ooh, Scissor Sisters.
3854973	3856354	The Police, Every Breath You Take.
3856574	3857295	Stalker Song.
3858212	3863578	Leonard Skinner, Sweet Home Alabama Good Charlotte, Girls and Boys Ace of Spades, Me and Some Guy
3874105	3875746	I'm all giddy after freaking walking out to Motorhead at E3.
3875766	3877968	That's 15 minutes, I won't get back.
3903242	3904463	Hey, DMN, shut up!
3904603	3905584	No, ooh, Alabama.
3905704	3906705	It's ooh, Alabama.
3906865	3907946	Because Alabama rocks.
3908427	3911230	I wanted to really ask those people at the IA Judgment booth.
3911890	3912771	What the hell is this for?
3912811	3916194	You tried to, and they totally were ignoring you at one point.
3916215	3919237	Because you were totally like, what the hell is this thing?
3921720	3922481	Ah, good times.
3922561	3923822	Too bad there won't be an E3 next year.
3924401	3926402	Um, or, I'm sorry, in its current form.
3926642	3931564	Anyway, uh, chatroom's yelling and bitching, I need to make this correction, the MTV logo already appears on Guitar Hero 1.
3932245	3946311	Sorry, I haven't, the last time I played Guitar Hero 1 was at E3, cause it was one of the games they had at Arena, and you know, it seems like every time you go into Arena, somebody's playing Guitar Hero, so, that's the last time I played it, and I didn't get to see the boot-up sequence at that time.
3946758	3951762	So maybe the signs of this acquisition were a long time coming then, you could infer from that.
3951822	3953543	So sorry for my oversight.
3953583	3954444	You can flog me later.
3954524	3958407	I'm sure that the MTV logo being on the game is only going to make the game better.
3961610	3962791	Ooh, MTV!
3963031	3964952	Instantly my brain has turned to jello!
3964972	3966814	If anything, all it will do is help...
3967447	3968388	Help promote the game.
3968448	3969349	That's about it.
3969389	3976796	They will be able to promote it more on their shows and do their own Guitar Hero, be a Guitar Hero TV contest thing or whatever.
3976816	3977116	I don't know.
3977496	3980899	Having the MTV logo on Guitar Hero makes it lose instant cool points.
3981820	3983902	Repeat what you said, Drew, not because you didn't have a mic.
3984122	3987445	Like, ooh, we might just be playing the Jackass theme on Guitar Hero.
3987585	3991549	Or, yeah, they'll combine some of their franchises here, you know, on
3992267	3992847	What is that show?
3992887	3997528	My Sweet Sixteen, Guitar Hero, whatever that fucking show is with the spoiled brats.
3998329	3999609	I guess he doesn't watch TV.
4000069	4000749	You know what?
4001069	4010212	I don't watch it very much either, but it's kind of one of those things when your roommate's watching Next, you can't help but kind of look and go, God damn, I weep for the youth of America.
4011012	4011492	It's okay.
4011532	4012012	What's next?
4012032	4013753	Are we going to see Beavis and Butthead in the crowd?
4014898	4015879	That would be okay.
4015959	4016679	That would be cool.
4016759	4017320	That would be cool.
4017700	4018700	Because I like Beavis and Bowhead.
4018880	4019821	Actually, that would be cool.
4020281	4023563	Or, like, have, like, some sort of, like, New Age thing.
4023623	4024324	No, not New Age.
4024344	4026505	Like, New Wave and then have, like, Daria hanging out on the side.
4027245	4028146	Or Nine Inch Nails concert.
4028466	4036191	Geeta in our chatroom says, This is the true story of seven gamers picked to play a game and have their lives taped.
4038172	4039753	Pull the gun trigger now.
4040073	4041634	Point it at my head and pull the trigger.
4043062	4044482	Moving on to other music game news.
4044502	4047443	This is a little bit exciting, but yet at the same time disappointing.
4047743	4052404	Word is coming via joystick from their hands-on of Parappa the Rapper on the PSP.
4053904	4065727	The PSP demo for Parappa the Rapper, which we reported last week is coming to the PSP, it's the exact same demo that the PS1 Parappa the Rapper used, which makes us think Parappa the Rapper on PSP is just going to be
4066258	4066959	Keep in touch!
4080131	4082253	Now, there is some silver lining to this.
4082293	4083634	The graphics have been cleaned up.
4083934	4085916	The audio is a little bit crisper.
4086856	4091020	The rapping guy, you know, Parappa, of course, still stutters, you know, when you don't hit the buttons right.
4091060	4092601	But I think that's kind of what they're supposed to do.
4093081	4099366	Now, supposedly, though, there is going to be a multiplayer mode, which could, you know, make this game the must-own.
4099527	4099887	I don't know.
4100527	4104250	But it should also be pointed out that there's cute little Parappa stickers for the PSP.
4104330	4106492	And I look at that and I go, I want one right now.
4107093	4107593	Right now.
4108214	4108754	That's hot.
4109948	4131916	consumer whore and Hal alright we're going to bring this part A to a close here but first we've got DDR sneak peeks for you guys that's right here on Orange Lounge Radio we've been previewing new DDR games that are coming out very soon Ultramix 4 a little later this year as well as DDR Universe sometime this winter at some point
4132771	4133672	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4299474	4300221	Thanks for watching!
4334226	4335077	Thanks for watching!
4353086	4359048	from DDR Ultra Mix 4, that is Rupesh Kartel with Yours to Command here on Orange Lounge Radio, the DDR Sneak Peeks.
4360068	4361949	Kind of 80s reminiscent, that song.
4361969	4362629	That's kind of cool.
4362829	4364750	It'll probably have a pretty easy step chart, but that's okay.
4364770	4367271	The noobs need something to play, and that's a good song, I think.
4367791	4382536	All right, we're going to go into another song, and this song is from DDR Universe, and I have a feeling this might be a little bit of a controversial song because they've taken an old Konami classic and really remixed the heck out of it, so it's interesting.
4383076	4389099	Imagine your favorite gothic whipping game of all time with a big band swing sound.
4390620	4391800	Yeah, I'm not even kidding.
4392000	4397363	It's Castlevania the Freestyle and Mix, Wave Group featuring Mickey G. See what you think.
4397403	4400945	This is coming to DDR Universe here on the Orange Lounge Radio Sneak Peeks.
4507025	4511266	Castelvania, The Freestyle and Mix, Orange Lounge Radio, DDR, Sneak Peaks
4527017	4531458	You actually get either Vampire Killer or I think Bloodlines, depending on who you play.
4531858	4536140	I think Maria gets Vampire Killer, and it's sort of a similar mix to that.
4536740	4543442	Also, that style of music has shown up in Dracula X on the PC Engine Duo.
4543762	4548564	But you can't help but imagine Alucard in the shiny jacket getting down, you know, all BG style, right?
4548684	4549064	A little bit?
4550144	4552745	But no, this is nothing new from Konami.
4552765	4553105	All right.
4553305	4553985	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4575419	4576960	I haven't played that game in like a year.
4577360	4581862	Chatroom is also yelling that we're not acknowledging Supernova that's coming out next week.
4581882	4585183	And should I point out, Loki actually already mentioned it, hello, in his upcoming releases.
4586064	4588725	But, you know, you guys already have heard the Supernova VR at this point.
4588745	4590846	We don't have anything new for you regarding that.
4591286	4595148	But we do have something new for you from DDR Ultramix 4, another track here.
4595808	4599390	This is a song called Electric Air, and it's by an artist called Amit.
4600130	4602491	And it's a simple four-letter name there, A-M-I-T, Amit.
4603056	4605443	and it's called Electric Air here on the DDR Sneak Previews.
4605483	4605925	Check it out.
4606045	4606547	Orange Lounge Radio.
4704346	4706027	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4732017	4732999	So is Toe Jam.
4733279	4734441	This is our last song tonight.
4734501	4738867	It's Big Idea with Return of the Toe Jam here on the Orange Lounge Radio.
4739168	4739689	Beep, beep.
4842990	4847152	Return of the Toe Jam by Big Idea, coming soon to DDR Universe.
4847252	4848113	That was cool.
4848493	4852815	Yeah, I just, I expect Minnie Pearl to come out towards the end of that song and go, Hi!
4854336	4855096	No, that's a great song.
4855116	4856197	Hi, Minnie Pearl!
4857717	4860639	No, it's, you know, it's not, again, it's interesting.
4860679	4864621	I think a lot of the songs we've played tonight kind of have this common theme where, like, you know,
4865160	4868961	Some people probably really liked it, and some people didn't like it so much.
4869001	4873762	But hopefully there was one of those four, at least, if not three, that you really dug.
4873802	4875423	And me personally, I kind of dug them all.
4875563	4879964	And I'm not just saying that because of the... Trust me, if I thought one of them sucked, I'd tell you.
4880344	4883525	But I think they're all pretty cool, so the game should be interesting.
4884585	4890727	I have actually done square dancing when I was younger, much younger.
4891423	4892404	Square Dance Revolution
4920100	4921001	Konami, you listening?
4921061	4922062	Square Dance Revolution.
4922102	4922623	Make it happen.
4922703	4923003	Come on.
4924345	4926387	They gave us Karaoke Revolution Country.
4926407	4928169	Yeah, Karaoke Revolution Country sold, didn't it?
4928229	4931193	Dude, I played that at E3, though, so I could sing Good Old Boys.
4932053	4932834	Oh, give me a break.
4932914	4935257	To get my Dukes of Hazzard on.
4935898	4940303	I think I played it at Konami Gamers Day, and there was some Shania song I sung in it.
4940839	4941279	I think.
4941399	4942059	I can't remember.
4942079	4942479	It's been a while.
4942499	4943140	Shania is awesome.
4944100	4945620	Do I even know you two anymore?
4945940	4946300	Apparently.
4946320	4947801	Dude, line dancing revolution.
4948041	4948981	See, there's a difference.
4949021	4954983	Line dancing is kind of like stupid cheerleading para para, but score dancing is kind of cool.
4957623	4957964	All right.
4958464	4961064	We need to go take a break so we can reminisce some more.
4961184	4967326	So that's going to do it for our part A, but we'll be back in a little bit with part B of our podcast.
