26000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	34000	Hello everybody out there on the internet
34000	37000	Welcome once again to Orange Lounge Radio
37000	43000	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, and the gamer culture and lifestyle
43000	45000	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky
45000	50000	Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only, Dark Sakura, Miss Jamie Summers
50000	51000	Roar
51000	52000	How you doing?
52000	53000	Roar
53000	54000	Roar?
54000	55000	Roar
55000	56000	Or Zip
56000	58000	Or A-R-J if you're old school
58000	59000	Roar
59000	60000	Roar
60000	65000	Also say hello to the one and only, Tech Master, Lowkey
65000	66000	Hi
66000	67000	How you doing?
67000	69000	I'm frustrated
69000	70000	Why?
70000	74000	Because certain things aren't working the way they should be
74000	75000	I see
75000	76000	Don't you hate that?
76000	77000	I do hate that
77000	81000	How things are described is very simple, yet never are
81000	83000	Welcome to life, here's your manual
83000	86000	Also say hello to joining us tonight
86000	90000	Once again, we're going to have to ban you from the show pretty soon
90000	91000	You're here too much, no I'm kidding
91000	92000	Say hello to Drunami
92000	94000	7-Zip is the wave of the future dammit
94000	95000	Whatever
95000	98000	We're a little bit cooled off this week
98000	102000	We had a pretty exciting week last week obviously with our 200th episode
102000	105000	But we're back here for episode 201
105000	108000	Doing the same stuff we're used to doing every week
108000	113000	The show's back to be in just two parts, of course we release on the podcast stream every Monday
113000	116000	And about Wednesday is just when you can expect to see part B
116000	121000	Or if you want to hear the whole thing in bulk you can listen to us live when we record on orangelaundry.com
121000	124000	On Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time
124000	129000	Or you can listen to our rebroadcast live of parts A and B that plays on all games radio
129000	134000	Over at allgames.com and that plays Monday nights at 5 o'clock Pacific
134000	136000	Or I believe 9 AM on Tuesdays
136000	142000	So if you're an early bird you can always catch that and you can hear all the show before it hits the podcast stream
142000	147000	Anyway we're going to start off as we always do talking about our gaming week
147000	150000	Or in DarkSakura's case perhaps her pinball week, I don't know
150000	155000	Yeah really actually all I played this week was Star Trek The Next Generation Pinball
155000	162000	Which we finally have mostly working except for a couple of really crappy soldering jobs
162000	167000	Whoever the previous owner was just like oh let's just put a bunch of goo here and solder it
167000	172000	And let's use hot glue to put this ramp back together and all this crap
172000	175000	Well Dan's been working on it, it's working just fine now
175000	179000	And other than that I ain't played crap because I've been like ugh
179000	181000	I've been sick all this past week
181000	183000	Pinball's still a type of game, I mean it's still
183000	188000	Pinball is what we had before Pong
188000	194000	Pinball is the backbone of the gaming community
194000	197000	Well them's big words there but I would agree
197000	201000	Without pinball we would not have our arcades
201000	204000	In the gaming tree pinball is an essential branch
204000	206000	Pinball is the root
206000	211000	I know I've said it before on this show, pinball was something I went to the arcades to play before DDR
211000	214000	Because I didn't play a whole lot in the arcades before that
214000	218000	Maybe your occasional Street Fighter 2, you know back when that was huge
218000	221000	When I was in junior high school using E. Honda's 100 hand slap
221000	225000	Look I was 100 hand slapping bitches long before Xbox Live
225000	231000	I remember going back in the old days and playing Old Black Knight
231000	234000	Before it had a digital display
234000	237000	Playing the Time Machine one
237000	240000	Before we had digital displays, Pinbot
240000	242000	I was going to say Pinbot was the shit
242000	245000	Was Pinbot, I'll ask you this then we'll move on
245000	249000	Was Pinbot on the NES a great thing
249000	254000	Or a horrible mistransformation of the pinball experience
254000	255000	Believe it or not I didn't have it
255000	259000	The first pinball game that I actually played on a home console
259000	262000	Was this like Gator game on the old school Gameboy
262000	263000	Oh god, Revenge of the Gator
263000	266000	Revenge of the Gator and Devil's Crush
266000	269000	On TurboGrafx
269000	270000	Did you ever play Pinball Quest?
270000	271000	No
271000	273000	Sonic Spinball however was my game
273000	275000	Sonic Spinball was pretty awesome
275000	278000	Pinball Quest though is an interesting 8-bit title
278000	281000	It's one of those things like, it was a really good concept
281000	283000	But it was a little bit glitchy sometimes
283000	286000	I do have to agree with Act of Death, Terminator 2, pinball ruled
286000	288000	But we're actually trying to work on getting a Medivhial Madness
288000	292000	Well if you want to join our chatroom and make comments such as that last person just did
292000	295000	You can join our chatroom over at www.orangelandrater.com
295000	296000	Click on chat
296000	300000	One thing I need to tell Jaded is that we have a Guns N' Roses now
300000	301000	Oh yeah
301000	303000	Yeah so we're in the Guns N' Roses Pinball Owners Club
303000	306000	How many pinball tables do you have now? You've got to have at least six
306000	307000	Seven
307000	308000	Oh my gosh
308000	310000	We've got Last Action Hero
310000	311000	Whodunnit
311000	313000	Twilight Zone, I love Twilight Zone
313000	316000	We have Johnny Mnemonic which sucks but Dan likes it
316000	319000	We've got Judge Dredd which actually now belongs to a friend of ours
319000	321000	Because we traded with him to get the Guns N' Roses
321000	324000	So we have Guns N' Roses and we have Star Trek The Next Generation
324000	326000	You're gonna open up an arcade in your garage pretty soon
326000	329000	Actually Dan's busy rearranging our entire house
329000	332000	Trying to get four pinball machines in and two maim cabinets
332000	335000	And yet I still have not come over and played all these pinball machines
335000	336000	I think I need two
336000	339000	He's building me a maim cabinet out of a Tekken 3 so I'm fairly happy
339000	340000	That's pretty hot
340000	341000	Alright well we'll move on
341000	344000	Loki how was your gaming week? Did you play any pinball?
344000	345000	No I did not
345000	346000	That's too bad
346000	347000	Well what did you play?
347000	352000	Well I played Saints Row and did a little bit more than that, that was pretty fun
352000	356000	And a little bit of Bomberman just because I have it
356000	360000	And Cookie Mama, I bought that for Nellie and she hated it
360000	363000	And so I've been playing it
363000	367000	I'm glad you tried to buy the wife a cooking game to teach her a thing or two
367000	368000	You know what
368000	370000	We try but it doesn't work you know
370000	372000	I'll buy it off you if you don't like it
372000	373000	No it's alright
373000	376000	So you must like it then
376000	379000	I play it just because I have it because you know
379000	381000	I've gotten rid of most of my other DS games
381000	386000	Okay explain to us you know because there's probably a lot of people who've seen this game on the shelves
386000	389000	You know it's Cookie Mama and it's gone, what the F is that?
389000	393000	It's basically a bunch of mini games that you play through
393000	398000	Depending on how you complete them you get a score at the end
398000	403000	And basically they have different mini games depending on what dish you're creating
403000	408000	So for example rice you know you'll have the first mini game will be measure out of the rice
408000	412000	And you have to measure it to a line and you have to do it with a time limit
412000	415000	And then they have another one that's a Japanese import game right
415000	416000	Yeah
416000	417000	Okay just
417000	419000	So rice is the first stage
419000	421000	Rice is the first stage
421000	422000	And then you have to measure out the water
422000	423000	It's your joke here sorry
423000	426000	And then you have you know the stage where you have to wash the rice
426000	429000	And then you have the stage where you have to cook the rice
429000	434000	They're all just like basically rhythm and you know
434000	436000	Just kind of like cutting and tapping and stuff like that
436000	439280	Now, see, wouldn't this game be more fun, though, if there was rapping in the background,
439280	440280	you know?
440280	441280	Possibly.
441280	446800	Now, wash the rice, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, like, or what was the, uh, I'm the cooking
446800	447800	chicken.
447800	451400	Well, here's, the problem, the problem with the game is the sensitivity is really, like,
451400	457080	off on a lot of the games, so, you know, you're really gonna get frustrated with stuff, you
457080	458480	know, and, I don't know.
458480	461280	And then there's also some levels, they don't really give you a good description of what
461280	464760	you're supposed to do, so it's kinda hard and you get frustrated real easy, which is
464760	467000	why Nellie stopped playing, because she couldn't figure out what the hell she was supposed
467000	470880	to do in certain levels, because it doesn't really explain it to you, they give you the
470880	475720	option to practice it, but they don't really kind of take you through a tutorial to tell
475720	480200	you how to cook, they're just like, do it!
480200	484960	Because Japanese are smarter, so, that's just, you know, that way that is.
484960	491840	Um, then of course, you know, Grand Theft Auto, because that's fun, um, Zuma, I've been
491840	494280	playing a lot of Xbox Live Arcade stuff.
494280	501440	I played Fusion Frenzy 2, which is part of that, you know, Tokyo Game Show demo thingy
501440	506880	on the live, and Fusion Frenzy 2 sucks balls, and I will not be buying that game.
506880	507880	Why?
507880	508880	It looked interesting to the trailer.
508880	510640	It was extremely lame.
510640	511640	Extremely lame.
511640	512640	What was lame about it?
512640	516580	Well, the games themselves are just dumb, like, there's one level, it's like, we're
516580	521220	trying to be Mario Party, but we're not even coming near Mario Party, it's just all these
521220	526480	mini games that have, there's like no point to them, and they're just dumb.
526480	531400	Well, is it maybe just because it's a demo, and maybe it's just not, all the other mini
531400	534720	games, you know, are just kind of variations of these mini games.
534720	538960	It's just like, you know, there's one of them that you're kind of these gladiator, you know,
538960	542960	American Gladiator type ball things, and you're rolling around, and you basically, okay, who
542960	546040	can cover the most space with their color?
546040	547920	And okay, that's kind of lame.
547920	552060	And then there is another one where you have to pick up boxes and put them in your corner,
552060	554120	and you can steal boxes from other players.
554120	558680	It screams Mario Kart, or not Mario Kart, Mario Party, but without any of the actual
558680	562360	board stuff, and it's just a very lame generic game.
562360	568880	So, and surprising enough, it's also by Hudson, which made the wonderful smash hit game, Bomberman
568880	569880	Act Zero.
569880	570880	So are we surprised?
570880	573160	Okay, but at the same time, they also made Mario Party.
573160	574160	Excellent.
574160	578160	And you know what, they've really sucked it up on the 360 so far, so whatever.
578160	580320	Did you ever play the first one?
580320	581320	No, I didn't.
581320	584600	Because there's an interesting comment in our chat room here, Mystic Gohan says, Fusion
584600	587000	Frenzy 2 sucked, but number one owned.
587000	591760	Well, maybe this is going to be better in a full game, but I'm not buying it, so whatever.
591760	597360	I also played the new Tenchu game, which was only available in Japan, and it's pretty cool.
597360	600720	You know, I wasn't really into Tenchu, but I like running around, jumping on buildings
600720	604960	and stuff, and throwing ninja stars into people's heads, so that's kind of cool.
604960	605960	No, that sounds fun.
605960	606960	Yeah, so that's fun.
606960	611120	The only problem about that game, because it wasn't Japanese, I had trouble figuring
611120	615960	out the controls, because it is kind of difficult to figure out what you've got to do.
615960	617960	So once I figured it out, it's pretty fun.
617960	622600	But supposedly they're putting up a Sonic the Hedgehog demo later, so that'd be pretty
622600	623600	cool to check out.
623600	628120	And I don't know if you want me to talk about it now, but I got this wonderful device, sure
628120	629120	go for it.
629120	633880	On the Xbox Live Vision camera, I have to say that this thing sucks.
633880	634880	Really?
634880	635880	Yeah.
635880	637280	Because I've heard a lot of positive reviews elsewhere.
637280	639480	Okay, the camera is blurry as fuck.
639480	641480	Blurry, blurry, blurry.
641480	642920	Did you just do something to it?
642920	643920	No.
643920	644920	Did you leave the sticker on?
644920	646160	No, there is no sticker on this thing.
646160	648200	I don't think there is a sticker on this thing.
648200	650320	No, there is no sticker on this thing.
650320	654680	It would have been hella funny if there was, and he's like, son of a bitch!
654680	655680	No.
655680	657160	Okay, so it's very blurry.
657160	658440	Very, very blurry.
658440	661960	That's because it knew what you and Nelly were going to be doing with it, so it had
661960	663160	to blur out the naughty bits.
663160	668640	Okay, I just wanted to take a picture of my face to put it on the Xbox Live, and no matter
668640	671640	what kind of lighting I have in the room, it's always blurry.
671640	673400	Very, very blurry.
673400	677800	And no matter what I do to adjust the focus on it, always blurry.
677800	681920	And then the other thing on this as well, I'm trying to hook it up to my PC.
681920	685280	Apparently it's supposed to be as easy as, plug in PC work.
685280	686280	No.
686280	687640	Of course it's never going to be like that.
687640	692280	So I got the updated drivers for it, and it's funny because the old drivers work kinda crappy,
692280	693280	but they work.
693280	694960	The new drivers don't work at all.
694960	698360	So this thing is just, it's doing nothing.
698360	701480	I was going to have a webcam for you guys, folks, and we were going to have the wonderful
701480	705720	webcam, but you can thank Microsoft for putting out a really shoddy camera.
705720	707400	What would happen if I plugged that in my Mac?
707400	708800	You think it would work right away?
708800	711200	No, it'll just go.
711200	713960	I'm going to try it during the break.
713960	714960	You know I gotta try.
714960	716520	Well, here's the thing.
716520	717520	Just for you.
717520	718520	That's the thing, though.
718520	720720	Like I said, the generic drivers worked on it.
720720	722440	The new drivers do not.
722440	726240	So go right ahead and try that, but you know what?
726240	727240	The new drivers don't.
727240	728240	So, whatever.
728240	737120	Now, the cool thing, you tried to video chat with me, and it was pretty blurry, but what's
737120	742160	interesting is that another podcaster, our old buddy Bobby, sent a picture of his kitty
742160	747440	cat, because you can send pictures on Xbox Live instead of messages if you want, and
747440	749520	I got a picture of his kitty cat, and it was pretty clear.
749520	753240	It was a little dark, like there were some contrast issues, but he probably just didn't
753240	755360	have the right lighting behind it.
755360	759040	Most of our houses aren't set up to have lighting behind where our systems are at.
759040	761600	At least in this house, I know the lighting is by the couch.
761600	766920	That's probably why he has the contrast issues, but it was sharp, unlike when we video chatted.
766920	767920	Well, here's the thing.
767920	772880	The video chat's only in 640 by 480, whereas the pictures are 1.3 megapixels, so that's
772880	773880	the difference.
773880	779040	So, yeah, it looks all blurry, but then when you take a picture, it's just, you know, supposed
779040	780040	to be clear.
780040	784520	Except for your gamer tag pictures, those are still blurry as hell, because I took one
784520	787280	and I'm like, wow, I can't see anything in it.
787280	791680	Then how come some of the other, like I have three other podcasters on my list who got
791680	796880	the camera early, because Microsoft likes them, and they all look fine.
796880	801520	I don't get it, but here's the thing, I say take it back.
801520	802520	It's not my face.
802520	803520	I'm not blurry.
803520	808120	I think that's what SSJ100Matt in chat says, maybe it's your face, Loki.
808120	810280	Yeah, and here's the other thing.
810280	812880	Thank you, Microsoft.
812880	821080	This camera is made for cyber sex, and I showed Rob why this camera is made for cyber sex.
821080	822240	It's very disturbing.
822240	823240	For some reason...
823240	824720	And I never want to see it again.
824720	832880	Okay, for some reason, a feature that was added into the video chat on live, and explain
832880	835800	to me why you would need this.
835800	841680	If you push the trigger buttons on your controller, it makes the other person's controller vibrate,
841680	844040	as long as you hold them down.
844040	850360	If that does not screen cyber sex, I don't know what does.
850360	851360	Thank you, Microsoft.
851360	853600	You guys really thought of everything.
853600	859760	You vision camera, would I recommend buying it?
859760	860760	I don't know.
860760	867080	I mean, maybe the room I'm using, because I got the camera to look decent, it was just
867080	872800	very blurry still, but compared to the last digital camera that we had, the webcam, I
872800	873800	guess it's okay.
873800	878240	I can't just get this thing to work anymore.
878240	881200	We'll try it on my Xbox when we're done, see if maybe the different lighting in this house
881200	882200	will help.
882200	883200	Maybe.
883200	884200	I don't know.
884200	886160	It's worth picking up if you can find one.
886160	891800	I know GameStop, at least where I got mine pre-ordered at, they didn't get any extras
891800	894920	in, so it might be pretty hard to find.
894920	897480	I'm not getting one.
897480	899600	You know what, you're not interested in the vision thing?
899600	900600	No.
900600	902800	You don't want the whole vibration with the controller thing?
902800	903800	No.
903800	906480	It was kind of funny when he did it, because it was like, what the hell, why is the controller
906480	907480	shaking?
907480	908480	And Loogie's like, do you feel that?
908480	909480	Do you feel that?
909480	916000	I have a PC, and I actually have a real webcam, which nobody is giving the address to since
916000	917320	I don't upload it to anywhere.
917320	922480	But you can't play Uno with the webcam on the PC, at least I don't know any versions
922480	923480	of it yet.
923480	926400	I don't touch our Xbox 360.
926400	927400	What about Dead Rising?
927400	931640	Okay, I played that, but that was the last thing I played, because it was all about zombie
931640	932640	killing.
932640	936640	I've been sort of not playing the 360.
936640	939520	No interest in Totem Ball or anything?
939520	940520	Pinball.
940520	941520	I don't know.
941520	944040	I kind of want one, but it can also kind of wait.
944040	948200	I mean, it's not something, I think I support many games for it right now, so yeah, I thought
948200	951880	I would want it right away, and I was kind of looking for one, but now I'm like, eh,
951880	953280	do I really need to video chat?
953280	954400	I don't know.
954400	956320	It can wait, especially after seeing Loogie's.
956320	957320	We'll see.
957320	959800	Let's see, My Gaming Week.
959800	961620	Actually not a lot of new stuff.
961620	963560	There really wasn't anything new I picked up this week.
963560	968200	I was interested in getting the camera at one point, but I wasn't able to get it, because
968200	971640	I didn't pre-order one, because I didn't think I would want it, but then I was going to go
971640	973460	look for it, and they didn't have it.
973460	977520	So I've pretty much just been watching a friend of mine play through Enchanted Arms, because
977520	981200	I showed it to a friend of mine, and he's been in love with it, and just over here playing
981200	987480	it a lot, so he got further and I did, so I think he's about, I think the percentage
987480	992560	said he was like 46% of the way through the game, so some of the voice acting gets a little
992560	994120	better when you get to midway.
994120	997160	Some of the voice actors are pretty good, and some are still pretty bad, but the game's
997160	998880	plot got interesting.
998880	1000140	It's pretty fun.
1000140	1003720	I think if you're a role-playing fan and you happen to have a 360, you should definitely
1003720	1006720	check out Enchanted Arms, because there's really not a lot else for you right now on
1006720	1009380	the 360, and Enchanted Arms is decent.
1009380	1012800	It's not a, hey, we made this at the last minute so we could say we have an RPG on the
1012800	1013800	system.
1013800	1014800	It's pretty good.
1014800	1015800	I was pretty happy.
1015800	1018920	Drew Nami, how was your gaming week?
1018920	1021600	Oddly enough, I've been playing a lot of Rez.
1021600	1022600	Really?
1022600	1024400	Really, really.
1024400	1027240	Aside from that, I haven't been really playing that many games.
1027240	1032320	They took a break from WoW and, oh yeah, I've been playing World of Warcraft a lot, actually.
1032320	1039400	I'm in a new guild, so my friend convinced me to join the gay guild on Proudmoore, so
1039400	1041680	I've been playing there a lot.
1041680	1042680	It's fun.
1042680	1043680	Yeah, I took a break.
1043680	1045320	I'm a little bit burned out.
1045320	1049240	Aside from that, I've been playing a little bit of Xenosaga, episode one, trying to finish
1049240	1051160	it so I can move on.
1051160	1053240	I borrowed Dirge of Cerberus from a friend.
1053240	1058440	It's actually not too bad, even though console first-person shooters are kind of just a sacrilege
1058440	1061160	to me.
1061160	1066440	Aside from that, I'm trying to get through Kingdom Hearts II on Proudmoore, and I realized
1066440	1069840	how much I truly suck at that game.
1069840	1072420	Aside from that, not much.
1072420	1075160	What would you say to the people that say Kingdom Hearts II is nothing but a bunch of
1075160	1076580	button mashing?
1076580	1080480	You haven't played it on Proudmoore, and you haven't gotten to Beast's Castle round two.
1080480	1085680	As you said, I read some reviews that said- There's even regular mode, the Demyx battle.
1085680	1088040	Yeah, Demyx is just a pain in the ass.
1088040	1090040	He's just a bitch.
1090040	1093400	Alright, well, let's go on to some housekeeping, and then we're going to-
1093400	1095920	Oh, I wanted to mention one thing that I thought was pretty cool.
1095920	1099160	GameStop, when I went and picked up my camera, I just looked around a little bit to see if
1099160	1100600	there's anything else I wanted.
1100600	1107440	I found a BeatMania 2DX turntable controller for $8.
1107440	1108440	Picked that sucker up.
1108440	1112080	Now, it's mine, because at least I'm babysitting it for a little while, because Loki hates
1112080	1113080	BeatMania.
1113080	1115720	Well, I just don't have any games.
1115720	1119160	At the time, I didn't have my PlayStation 2 back, but I finally got it back.
1119160	1120160	Do you have US BeatMania?
1120160	1121160	No.
1121160	1122160	You can borrow that?
1122160	1125680	If you want, you can borrow my- So, you can borrow my Japanese PlayStation, and the various
1125680	1126680	styles I own.
1126680	1127680	I don't own them all.
1127680	1128680	No, I've got my HD loader.
1128680	1129680	I'll just load the Japanese.
1129680	1130680	Oh, well.
1130680	1133840	I'll put the new 2DX that they have in Japan over there on it.
1133840	1134840	Alright, well.
1134840	1138240	Excuse me for trying to do something- I'll just leave the controller here, because
1138240	1139440	I don't want to play 2DX.
1139440	1140440	I couldn't pass that up.
1140440	1141440	I'm going to play doubles.
1141440	1144680	I'm going to get back into 2DX and play doubles, because doubles keyboard mania was a blast,
1144680	1147680	and when you could play that in the arcade, people were like, WTF!
1147680	1149240	So many buttons!
1149240	1156800	Dude, no, watching someone do, like, a seven-star- Yeah, I was never as good- I mean, I could
1156800	1159080	get through a couple doubles songs, you know.
1159080	1162680	I was pretty decent- I could do three stars, that was it, and doubles.
1162680	1165400	Who was that guy that is so good at keyboard mania?
1165400	1166400	Blue?
1166400	1167400	Is that his name?
1167400	1168400	Blue Guy?
1168400	1169400	Whoa!
1169400	1173240	He can smoke those doubles, like, you know, that are, like, the maximum level, and I'll
1173240	1176280	tell you what- I loved watching him play keyboard mania, though.
1176280	1182120	That gives me a gamer boner so much more than the 2DX and Papa Music videos.
1182120	1183440	He also plays piano very well.
1183440	1185560	Yeah, because I like the piano music a lot more.
1185560	1188600	I mean, I'm not disrespecting the 2DX, you know, because there's a lot of impressive
1188600	1192320	stuff there, but watching the keyboard mania was, whew, very impressive.
1192320	1194520	You should also see him do doubles on Pump It Up.
1194520	1195520	Alright.
1195520	1196520	Someday, someday.
1196520	1197520	Alright.
1197520	1198520	Housekeeping!
1198520	1201520	First, we want to thank everybody for all the well wishes for episode 200, because we
1201520	1204560	continued to kind of get them throughout the week, even after the show.
1204560	1208280	I got a couple messages on Xbox Live, which was very nice, and I know we got some emails
1208280	1211880	and some message board posts, so we just wanted to say thank you guys, and it was a fun show,
1211880	1216720	it was a long show, but it was a fun show, and really glad you guys that were able to
1216720	1220960	join us live did, or if you couldn't join us live, we're glad you got through all three
1220960	1223760	parts, so thank you.
1223760	1227280	Also want to say the DDR sneak peeks are continuing tonight.
1227280	1228280	Those haven't stopped.
1228280	1232440	They'll be a little later on in this program, four new tracks, two from Ultramix 4 and two
1232440	1240160	from Universe, and also I want to say about this podcast is we are now a default podcast
1240160	1245900	on a little handy program called XB Stream, and if you haven't checked out this program,
1245900	1249120	it's pretty neat.
1249120	1252080	I'm so surprised that something like this came out of Homebrew.
1252080	1254320	I'm saying that in a positive way.
1254320	1258300	It pretty much seems like one person really put in all this effort into this program and
1258300	1263100	just really did something that Microsoft should have done themselves.
1263100	1266080	It's kind of impressive that this one guy did this, but basically what he's done is
1266080	1271040	he set up a program that not only catches podcasts and automatically shares them over
1271040	1276380	the network to your Xbox 360, it doesn't put them on the hard drive if the Xbox 360 uses
1276380	1280780	the network, but what it also does is it downloads RSS feeds.
1280780	1282840	Let's say you want to read Kotaku.
1282840	1287840	Let's say you have Kotaku in your feed, and what it does is it translates the text of
1287840	1292400	the RSS feed and makes it an image, and then so if you go through your photo gallery on
1292400	1296500	Xbox 360, you can read RSS feeds, and you might be thinking, well, when in the hell
1296500	1297500	would this be useful?
1297500	1301320	Well, if somebody else is using the computer and you're using the Xbox 360, you could still
1301320	1306440	read those live blogging things going on, so it's a really neat idea, so I think that's
1306440	1311080	great and we're really happy to be included as one of the podcasts that you'll get when
1311080	1315420	you download this program now, so if you want to check it out, it's over at xbstream.com.
1315420	1319640	This is the same program that caused a little bit of controversy when it first came out
1319640	1325960	because I imagine the program was originally designed with RSS feeds in mind, so what it
1325960	1330800	was doing is that it was refreshing the RSS feeds every 15 minutes and grabbing the last
1330800	1331800	30 items.
1331800	1336400	Well, the unfortunate thing is is that when they decided to enable the podcast stuff as
1336400	1341960	well, they kept the same settings, so folks that were in the initial release of the program
1341960	1346580	as the default podcast, like I know GamerAndy was one of them, among many others, like his
1346580	1350280	site got hammered because you had all these people that were trying out the software because
1350280	1356200	Major Nelson had posted about it, downloading 30 episodes of his show at a time and re-hammering
1356200	1357200	his feed.
1357200	1361080	It was almost like getting a denial of service attack, so it was like one of those, oh, crap,
1361080	1364560	someone made a really big mistake, but I know they all worked it out and the author of the
1364560	1368120	program was very like, oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, and they've worked
1368120	1373120	it out now, so it only, I think, hits it once in a while and it only downloads one podcast
1373120	1379440	by default, so that's pretty exciting because when I told the webmaster, our old friend
1379440	1383040	VxJ6V that we were going to be on there, he's like, wait a minute, I was reading that this
1383040	1384040	might not be a good thing.
1384040	1387800	I'm like, no, no, no, they fixed it, they fixed it, we're cool, so anyway, check it
1387800	1392780	out if you guys have an Xbox 360 and a network that it's connected to.
1392780	1395080	Now we shall go into some news.
1395080	1396080	Shall we, Jamie?
1396080	1398080	Sure, why don't we?
1398080	1402440	Well, you know, I always shake my head because, you know what I call him?
1402440	1405400	I call him Ken Crayon Eater.
1405400	1414360	So apparently the price of the PlayStation 3 in Japan has been dropped.
1414360	1420460	Even though they're still having the delays with their production, they're stating that
1420460	1428720	they are going to reprice the 20 gigabyte model with an inclusion of the HDMI port for
1428720	1439400	49,980 yen, which is roughly 48 bucks in the US, about 225 pounds in the UK, which is actually
1439400	1442280	a reduction from 62,790 yen.
1442280	1448240	So that's a pretty significant drop, at least, you know, a couple hundred.
1448240	1455080	So they're also saying that at the Tokyo Game Show there were going to be 200 playable consoles.
1455080	1459200	What I haven't found out is if they are actually still those rack mounted servers.
1459200	1460600	Yes, they are.
1460600	1463120	See, I'm not surprised.
1463120	1467560	Now one thing that was mentioned, and I found out, you know, after reading the article a
1467560	1471080	bit of a rebuttal on this, is that they're saying that the online service was going to
1471080	1475480	offer Mega Drive and PC Engine titles, but Sega had something different to say about
1475480	1476880	that, didn't they?
1476880	1477880	Yes.
1477880	1481720	They said that it was something that they were considering based on, you know, the architecture
1481720	1487480	of the online system, but it wasn't something that they were doing right away.
1487480	1489960	More proof that Ken Kudaragi eats crayons.
1489960	1494120	However, one thing I do think is kind of cool is their global mapping system so that you
1494120	1499320	can, basically what it does is you upload your pictures, data about where you live,
1499320	1502800	and it makes a world map where various PS3 gamers live.
1502800	1505840	It's kind of neat, but...
1505840	1507640	So it's like that one site.
1507640	1508640	What is that site?
1508640	1509640	Frapper.
1509640	1510640	Thank you.
1510640	1511640	Frapper.
1511640	1514480	It's like a frapper, because we have an Orange Launch Radio Frapper, and you should join
1514480	1517540	that if you haven't already, but yeah, it sounds like Frapper for your PS3.
1517540	1519040	I'm getting that impression.
1519040	1520040	Huh.
1520040	1523840	But I still think that, you know, he needs to keep the bicycle helmet on a little bit
1523840	1524840	longer.
1524840	1528320	His head hasn't quite healed from that last falling.
1528320	1530440	He's still got the baby soft spot.
1530440	1531440	Yeah.
1531440	1533720	His skull hasn't completely molded together.
1533720	1536680	You guys are crazy.
1536680	1540520	It's interesting because I'm reading about the XB Stream stuff in chat, because apparently,
1540520	1543740	you know, some of the other podcasters who were affected by that whole thing were very
1543740	1546520	vocal about it, and some of our, you know, folks listen to other podcasts.
1546520	1550660	I do try to listen to other podcasts, but ever since my iPod broke last week, it's been
1550660	1554440	very hard for me to listen to other podcasts, so I'm kind of behind on all the gossip on
1554440	1556360	XB Stream.
1556360	1561560	But they're saying, let's see, they said here something about gamer Andy loves XB Stream.
1561560	1563480	I think there's a hint of sarcasm there.
1563480	1566200	Funny Dale says, XB Stream nearly shut down IGN.
1566200	1567200	I'm not kidding.
1567200	1570480	And then Funny Dale goes on to say, wait, shut down IGN.
1570480	1574460	On second thought, I love XB Stream.
1574460	1578560	But Black Wolf says, reminds us that Tiger Claw, or was saying to Tiger Claw, I guess
1578560	1582080	in a message here, he offered to compensate for the bandwidth bills.
1582080	1586320	The author was like, so, you know, oops, I really made a big, big mistake.
1586320	1587320	I'll pay for the bills.
1587320	1590600	I thought that was kind of nice, you know, so.
1590600	1596560	Anyway, moving on, I wanted to say really quickly regarding the PlayStation 3.
1596560	1600120	There's an interesting series that Kotaku's been running, because they have some folks
1600120	1604320	over at the show, and they've been posting these videos on YouTubes asking people, do
1604320	1607600	you want to get the Wii or the PlayStation 3?
1607600	1610240	Not sure why they didn't include the Xbox 360, but whatever.
1610240	1615460	I guess maybe they figured that, you know, Xbox 360 is not really the console of choice
1615460	1616460	in Japan right now.
1616460	1617460	Although, I don't know.
1617460	1620800	I figured they had long waits to see Blue Dragon, but anyway.
1620800	1625120	They're going Wii or PlayStation 3, and they did this little poll here, and it turns out
1625120	1629600	PlayStation 3 was getting about two to one of the vote.
1629600	1632680	So for every one person that said they wanted a Wii had two people that said they wanted
1632680	1634280	a PlayStation 3.
1634280	1639580	Now if you poll your average American, or heck, even European message board, I'm not
1639580	1641880	seeing that same correlation.
1641880	1646620	So what is it about Japan and their love for the PlayStation 3?
1646620	1649360	Is it the fact that Nintendo doesn't go to Tokyo Game Show?
1649360	1650360	I'll state the obvious there.
1650360	1655580	Is it maybe that people are just, you know, they're, because the ooh and aahs of Sony
1655580	1658880	being there, they're just loving that, and that's kind of skewing their view a little
1658880	1659880	bit, or what?
1659880	1665800	I think my old theory stands is that it has to do with getting a Blu-ray.
1665800	1669440	I mean, honestly, I think that the Japanese market is looking at the whole Blu-ray thing
1669440	1670440	as a positive.
1670440	1675260	I mean, having a DVD player in it is what sold the PS2, because at the time, it was
1675260	1680820	a lot cheaper to get a PS2 than to go out and just buy a DVD player.
1680820	1683640	I think that they're looking for that multiple functionality.
1683640	1684640	Interesting.
1684640	1689300	I'm looking at our chat room to see what they say here.
1689300	1693840	Some folks, Fireboma says, Tokyo Game Show is mostly fanboys.
1693840	1697800	Nintendo wasn't at Tokyo Game Show, so their fans weren't there.
1697800	1702080	And some interesting, Nintendo Maniac 64 says, oh, the poll was probably done that way probably
1702080	1704400	because the 360 is already out.
1704400	1708020	So okay, that makes sense why they didn't include 360 in the poll.
1708020	1712240	But what about some of those, well, I don't know if, I can't remember if we get into it
1712240	1715640	later in the program, but I'll just quickly say, what about some of those 360 games that
1715640	1717880	are being shown at Tokyo Game Show?
1717880	1721680	I mean, do you think that this might sway the Japanese public at all?
1721680	1726120	I mean, I was watching the demo for Blue Dragon, some of the gameplay video, it looked pretty
1726120	1727120	hot.
1727120	1731080	So I don't know, is it going to be enough, or is it too little too late?
1731080	1733080	I guess we'll see.
1733080	1741080	Well, as far as the PS3 itself, you know, where they were going to have the price drop
1741080	1746280	in Japan, we are not quite so lucky here.
1746280	1752680	There's basically stating that there is no plans to drop the price in the United States.
1752680	1758360	It's still going to be 499 for the low end, 599 for the 60 gig version.
1758360	1765400	There hasn't been any set word if that's going to apply to Europe as well, and they're still
1765400	1769760	set for 2007 launch in March.
1769760	1770760	Pretty interesting.
1770760	1773660	A lot of them might have to do with how it works here.
1773660	1777600	Do you think if we have a crappy launch here in the US that Europe might get the price
1777600	1781760	drop as incentive for them to go buy them?
1781760	1785320	It's possible, but that's not really how Sony plays.
1785320	1789640	One other thing though is that we are getting the HDMI slot on the low end system.
1789640	1794160	Well, that's interesting because a lot of people were saying that your PlayStation 3
1794160	1799400	would be totally gimped with no HDMI slot if in the future you choose to upgrade to
1799400	1801040	an HDTV.
1801040	1803000	So does this sway anyone's mind?
1803000	1804040	I don't know.
1804040	1809240	It's all about digitally signing those wonderful Blu-ray movies and possibly games.
1809240	1813560	That is why they need that HDMI slot on there because, you know, if you don't have that
1813560	1816620	then someone might be able to purchase the lower end model and, guess what, get past
1816620	1818080	all that encryption.
1818080	1819080	So that would be pretty nice.
1819080	1823240	Well, I guess we go back to that old saying, the game system is only as good as the games
1823240	1828200	that are on it, and I guess that will truly be what ends up selling these PlayStation
1828200	1829200	3s or not.
1829200	1832240	Yeah, and one of the games that they're hoping to sell the PlayStation 3s or at least
1832240	1835040	this online service is this game, Flow.
1835040	1840140	Now a lot of people may not know about Flow, or maybe you do because it's actually a
1840140	1843400	game that's already on the web for free.
1843400	1846360	Kind of funny because they're trying to sell the game.
1846360	1850100	Not saying it's a bad game, it's actually a pretty fun game, and you can check it out
1850100	1852100	online.
1852100	1853100	Just do a search for Flow.
1853100	1855760	It's a pretty cool little thing they were talking about.
1855760	1857440	It was actually kind of an experiment.
1857440	1862200	You know, if I do a search for Flow I might get a lot of websites that aren't related
1862200	1864120	to gaming at all.
1864120	1867480	So perhaps you might want to specify that search a little more.
1867480	1868480	Okay.
1868480	1874000	Well, if you want to play Flow in the wonderful Flash version, you can do so.
1874000	1876700	There's a couple different places to check it out.
1876700	1893200	The first one's going to be at intihuatanai.usc.edu slash cloud slash flowing slash core dot html.
1893200	1895320	So I hope you got a pen and paper for that one because...
1895320	1897840	If not, rewind the show and write faster.
1897840	1902960	Although, if you're looking for an easier way to actually play this, you can download
1902960	1909200	copies and I believe that there's one that's mirrored on PSP updates, or PS3 updates I
1909200	1910200	would imagine.
1910200	1917720	But anyways, so yeah, this game is going to be downloadable and supposedly you're going
1917720	1922160	to have to purchase this, which is kind of funny because isn't this going to have a browser
1922160	1925840	in it anyway, so couldn't you, I don't know, go browse over to this website and play it
1925840	1926840	for free?
1926840	1933720	I mean, that seems kind of retarded to me, that you would be able to, I don't know, download
1933720	1936480	this for free instead of paying for Sony's service.
1936480	1937880	That kind of defeats the purpose of...
1937880	1941560	Well, what about all those Geometry Wars clones when they were out there?
1941560	1946000	You know, you could play it for free, quote unquote, online or on the other platforms
1946000	1947000	they were putting it on.
1947000	1949440	Yeah, but you can't play it for free on the PlayStation 3.
1949440	1951440	See, you can actually go with...
1951440	1956520	Well, but you can't play Geometry Wars for free on the Xbox 360, that's what I'm saying.
1956520	1963000	But you can, with the PlayStation 3, web browse over to this site and either download it to
1963000	1968040	your hard drive and run it in Linux or you could, I don't know, play it in the web browser
1968040	1972480	assuming that this thing supports Flash, I would hope so since it's a next gen console
1972480	1977280	with the fucking cell processor, it should be able to support Flash.
1977280	1979280	So yeah, you could play this game.
1979280	1987160	Ota G says, but it's in HD, but who cares?
1987160	1991720	It's going to be in HD anyways because it's going to be on your TV.
1991720	1992720	I don't know.
1992720	1993720	I just think it's a waste of money.
1993720	1998220	All right, well this was certainly a controversial story in the scene this week regarding the
1998220	2002880	PlayStation 3 and it has to do with Gran Turismo HD.
2002880	2006040	And now there's these stories that have been going around about the fact that there's going
2006040	2011080	to be this Gran Turismo HD classic that's going to be kind of the entry into the GT
2011080	2016440	series and then there's going to be, I guess, 750 cars that you can download online for
2016440	2021520	between 50 cents to a dollar a piece and 50 tracks between a dollar fifty and four fifty
2021520	2022520	a piece.
2022520	2027160	They're all the cars that have been basically created for the Gran Turismo series for the
2027160	2028160	last 10 years.
2028160	2032040	But Gran Turismo HD Premium will come with two courses and 30 cars.
2032040	2039840	Yes, the Premium is going to be basically kind of a test model for Gran Turismo 5.
2039840	2043360	It's basically really detailed looking cars.
2043360	2048000	Think like Forza or something like that and it's just really nice stuff.
2048000	2051600	The reason why they don't have 750 cars in the Premium version is because they haven't
2051600	2054600	had a chance to create the models for all the cars yet.
2054600	2064720	They're really hurrying to get this game pushed out, which screams flaws up the ass.
2064720	2069880	Basically the classic version, I guess, is going to be an upscaled version of Gran Turismo
2069880	2072960	4 with all those wonderful cars to purchase.
2072960	2076880	So you're saying if I go to the store and buy this Gran Turismo classic, I can't do
2076880	2077880	anything with it?
2077880	2080920	Well, Classic and Premium are in one game.
2080920	2081920	It's different modes.
2081920	2082920	Oh, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.
2082920	2084960	Oh, I made it sound like it was two separate games.
2084960	2088000	No, it's just one game.
2088000	2092600	You will get some cars, but if you think about it, 30 cars in two tracks is a lot less than
2092600	2100000	say 250 that I'm used to getting at the store for $49.99 for PlayStation 2.
2100000	2102360	Huh, interesting.
2102360	2105320	I don't know, what do you think about this microtransaction thing?
2105320	2106600	Well, here's the thing.
2106600	2109580	It doesn't stop at cars or tracks.
2109580	2113520	They're going to be adding parts and skins for your cars as well.
2113520	2117440	They want it to become the iTunes of Gran Turismo, so you're going to be spending thousands
2117440	2122240	of dollars, hopefully, on this crap for one game.
2122240	2127800	Well, I think about Test Drive Unlimited, which is something I've been playing a lot
2127800	2132880	recently that also has a crap load of cars and a crap load of parts and things that you
2132880	2138160	can get with it, but you unlock them naturally as you go to the in-game store.
2138160	2141720	And none of this microtransaction crap, you know, you buy the game and all this stuff
2141720	2142720	is included.
2142720	2145460	You unlock it within the game, and that's what we're all kind of used to.
2145460	2147520	And here's the other fun thing about this, too.
2147520	2154060	They were saying that a lot of the cars in this, they're going to be expensive because
2154060	2162920	they want you to actually be, you know, just kind of having that, I guess, other people
2162920	2163920	have expensive cars.
2163920	2166080	Ooh, I've got to have that expensive car.
2166080	2169200	It's not going to be, it's actually going to be expensive.
2169200	2171800	Do I get to buy horse armor for said car?
2171800	2174720	Well, if it were a horse, maybe, no.
2174720	2178880	But the whole thing screams to me as a bad idea.
2178880	2182400	And I think a lot of people, I mean, they may be fans of Gran Turismo, but who's really
2182400	2184360	going to pay for all the cars?
2184360	2189320	I mean, that's just like saying, oh, here's Madden NFL.
2189320	2192160	By the way, there's no teams or arenas included.
2192160	2193960	You have to purchase those separately.
2193960	2197440	Oh, by the way, the football's not included either, you know.
2197440	2205640	It's like buying a car without tires or an engine or seats or a body, I mean, it's retarded.
2205640	2208400	So what exactly am I paying for here?
2208400	2213560	TigerKlon's chat says, maybe you end up buying rims and spinners for the cars.
2213560	2216960	And that's the other thing, too, about these cars.
2216960	2221680	Haz says, I want to buy a pine air freshener for my car, a little fuzzy dice that can hang
2221680	2223000	from them.
2223000	2231000	I mean, why would you spend all this money on this?
2231000	2234520	I really don't see people doing this, because I know they're really trying to push this
2234520	2238880	microtransaction thing, and if it goes well, you can better believe that Gran Turismo 5
2238880	2241200	is going to be the same thing.
2241200	2246520	Is there a possibility here that this whole thing's being grossly misinterpreted or something's
2246520	2247520	wrong here?
2247520	2250600	Because I know on the internet this week it was a little bit back and forth, rumor or
2250600	2251600	not rumor.
2251600	2259680	I had several interviews actually with the head people for the lead on Gran Turismo HD,
2259680	2261240	and they've confirmed this stuff.
2261240	2265480	Now the thing they haven't confirmed, at least they didn't say anything about the pricing
2265480	2271280	on this and whether a lot of people aren't probably going to be buying 750 cars.
2271280	2273000	That's a fact.
2273000	2279180	But they didn't mention, well, if I purchase, say, a Honda Civic or something and someone
2279180	2284200	purchases a Lamborghini, I mean, am I going to purchase a more expensive car to be able
2284200	2291240	to race against these people, because they're going to be smoking me in this soup of cars.
2291240	2295400	I think the whole thing's a bad idea, and I know there's been a lot of comparisons to
2295400	2300760	Project Gotham Racing 3, but I kind of find it a little bit, you know, that game does
2300760	2302560	actually come with cars and tracks.
2302560	2307020	In fact, I think quite an unlimited amount of tracks since you can create your own courses
2307020	2311960	in there, but the fact is I don't have to purchase these cars in order to be able to
2311960	2316340	enjoy the game, whereas if I want to play the online version of Classic, yes, you do
2316340	2319920	have to purchase those cars, and yes, you do have to purchase those tracks.
2319920	2323760	So I think it's kind of retarded that I should have to spend money on a game that I already
2323760	2325320	spent money on.
2325320	2326400	Interesting.
2326400	2327640	More interesting comments from chat.
2327640	2328640	They're just lit up on this.
2328640	2333800	Funny Dale says, Sony is going to make players of Gran Turismo HD pay $5 a gallon for virtual
2333800	2334800	gasoline.
2334800	2338320	PlayStation 3, this is really living.
2338320	2340240	Funny.
2340240	2343720	Stick Axe, you know, a little bit of a counterpoint here.
2343720	2348360	If the game was cheap, and if I only like a few tracks, I don't have to spend $40 for
2348360	2350840	a game I only want half of.
2350840	2357000	True, and the whole thing is, you know, the Gran Turismo HD Premium or whatever, it's
2357000	2361840	just a fucking demo for Gran Turismo 5 is basically what it is.
2361840	2364960	You know, why should I pay for an upscaled version of 4?
2364960	2371880	Seeing as you can buy 4 and upscale it anyways, you know, why the hell, well first off, if
2371880	2375400	I were ever to buy PlayStation 3, I would never be buying this game at all.
2375400	2378160	I mean, I would not touch this game with a 10 foot pole.
2378160	2381320	I would wait for a better racing game to come out, because you know what, there's going
2381320	2383480	to be a lot more out there.
2383480	2387640	The only way I could ever see this selling is if it were like $10 for the core of it,
2387640	2389920	and then everything else you can pay for.
2389920	2394480	If it were like, you know, you can buy 200 cars for $20 or something like that, then
2394480	2398920	maybe yeah, someone might go ahead and do that, but if I'm paying a buck a car, and
2398920	2404800	they want me to spend $900 on fucking cars, alright, that's going to happen.
2404800	2411220	I think that they did it very well for, what was it, Project Gotham 3 on Xbox 360 where
2411220	2413520	they had car packets.
2413520	2418080	Where you spend this number of points, you get a certain set of cards, like the Ferrari
2418080	2420480	packet or the Mustang packet or something like that.
2420480	2424400	And some were, but you still, you didn't really have to get those to enjoy the full experience
2424400	2427760	of the game, and there were also a lot of bonus cards that were commercially subsidized
2427760	2428760	or something like that.
2428760	2432120	Like you could get the card that had the Xbox 360 logo on it and some of that other stuff,
2432120	2433760	you know, so.
2433760	2439240	But how is this different from that Project Gotham 3 pack?
2439240	2442840	It comes because Project Gotham 3 actually is a full game without them?
2442840	2443840	Yeah, it's a full game.
2443840	2448040	You do not need to have these cars in order to enjoy the game.
2448040	2452000	It's kind of an added bonus if you want to buy the cars, then yeah, you can go ahead
2452000	2453240	and do that.
2453240	2458700	You don't need them to play online, whereas this, you will need to play online.
2458700	2462520	You will need to purchase the cars, and I also have, I don't have a problem with purchasing
2462520	2466120	the cars, you know, so much as I have a problem with purchasing the tracks, too.
2466120	2468240	I mean, that's kind of retarded.
2468240	2471020	Why should I have to purchase elements of this game?
2471020	2474600	What the fuck are you using the Blu-ray Disc for anyways, because it's obviously not storing
2474600	2476280	all these tracks and cars.
2476280	2479960	Alright, we're going to leave with a couple of chat comments here, and then we'll move
2479960	2480960	on here.
2480960	2484880	Gita in chat says, I don't really care, waiting for Need for Speed Carbon.
2484880	2488240	And Nintendo Maniac 64 says Excite Truck for the win.
2488240	2492480	So sounds like some people are just going to take their money elsewhere, we'll see.
2492480	2499400	Well anyways, there's actually some interesting stuff coming out other than Gran Turismo HD,
2499400	2504040	and that is our favorite game to talk about, Africa.
2504040	2505400	What the hell is Africa?
2505400	2510120	Well, that's kind of funny, because it's actually kind of what we thought it would be.
2510120	2516360	It's basically a virtual African safari, where you can take pictures and basically keep them.
2516360	2519000	It's Pokemon Snap with drafts.
2519000	2524320	Exactly, but it's not really a game, though.
2524320	2530420	It's basically a virtual safari, virtual Africa, where you get to see animals and basically
2530420	2533280	experience Africa without going to Africa.
2533280	2536200	Did Elton John do the music and Tim Rice the lyrics?
2536200	2537200	I don't know.
2537200	2538200	Don't care.
2538200	2539200	You know what?
2539200	2541440	I like Jumbo Safari, because you can harpoon animals.
2541440	2542440	It's the same thing.
2542440	2543520	Well, you know what I wanted?
2543520	2544680	That game is the shit right there.
2544680	2546680	I love that fucking safari game.
2546680	2548600	That's what this fucking Africa game needs to be.
2548600	2549600	Jumbo Safari!
2549600	2552320	Do we fucking have Jumbo Safari on the consoles anywhere?
2552320	2556040	No, but I think a Walmart in town still has one.
2556040	2557400	That fucking game is the shit.
2557400	2561280	I swear to God, if you have an arcade near you that has a Jumbo Safari, you need to pour
2561280	2562280	thousands of dollars.
2562280	2563280	We'll take that $900.
2563280	2569000	Real quick, in-studio, I have the trailer running right now for Africa, and granted,
2569000	2570320	it looks fucking amazing.
2570320	2571920	Yeah, it's pretty.
2571920	2576120	It's very pretty, but the thing is, it's like, what the hell is this?
2576120	2581120	It's Africa, and there's grass.
2581120	2582120	It's the barons.
2582120	2584000	And there's birds and stuff.
2584000	2585000	It's Chuck Norris.
2585000	2587560	Yes, it's the barons without Chuck Norris jokes.
2587560	2588560	What more do you need?
2588560	2593920	So, granted, okay, great, it's Elephants, it's the Discovery Channel, you know.
2593920	2598200	That's basically kind of what it seems to me to be, but, I don't know, do we really
2598200	2599200	want, you know.
2599200	2600200	Peppa Lumps!
2600200	2602720	Do you really need to, like, buy this stuff?
2602720	2604480	Here's the game I would recommend buying.
2604480	2606160	Cabela's African Safari.
2606160	2611000	You get to go destroy, you know, elephants and rhinos and stuff.
2611000	2613280	Yes, they have cheetahs and stuff.
2613280	2619240	I want to see, like, the whole true circle of life where, like, they eat animals.
2619240	2620680	Ooh, hyenas.
2620680	2623040	It's Africa, and look at, they're eating animals.
2623040	2627920	Look at the cute hyena eating the carcass.
2627920	2629320	Then suddenly out of nowhere, crikey!
2629320	2631320	Oh, wait, bad taste, sorry, bad taste.
2631320	2633480	It's staying right through my heart!
2633480	2634480	Bad taste.
2634480	2636120	Oh, the hippo wiggling his little ears.
2636120	2637120	It looks great.
2637120	2639040	I mean, this looks really, really good.
2639040	2642960	It's just, I think that, you know, they should do, maybe this is just the opening movie,
2642960	2644960	like how often do we get pissed off at that?
2644960	2649200	Like, you know, you see the opening movie, and then, like, the game looks nothing like
2649200	2650200	it.
2650200	2651200	You know what I mean?
2651200	2654360	Oh, you mean, like, kind of like, oh, I don't know, Motorstorm?
2654360	2656080	Ooh, pretty.
2656080	2662440	So granted, okay, this is, you know, really cool and stuff, but I don't know, I don't
2662440	2663440	know if this-
2663440	2664440	It does look amazing.
2664440	2666440	I mean, graphically, it's, but yeah, what the hell is it?
2666440	2669400	It's like, I don't need tech demos as a fucking game.
2669400	2670960	Yeah, you're just-
2670960	2671960	Dan?
2671960	2672960	Wait a minute.
2672960	2673960	They cut it off before he ate the gazelle!
2673960	2677440	Aren't you the same person that said you were wanting to get a copy of Wii Play from Japan?
2677440	2678440	Yeah, because that's fun.
2678440	2680440	I don't want tech demos as a game.
2680440	2685520	Yeah, tech demos as in, like, okay, here's ducks, okay, and look at the ducks.
2685520	2688880	Oh my god, Jeremy Todd 1 is great.
2688880	2689880	What do you say?
2689880	2693480	In Africa, you will be able to hunt down your favorite species of rare animals and take
2693480	2694480	pictures of them.
2694480	2697840	On rare nights, usually nights with a full moon, you will be able to see Chuck Norris
2697840	2700360	running around killing elephants with his bare hands.
2700360	2704400	Take a picture for massive damage.
2704400	2705400	That was beautiful.
2705400	2706400	That's great.
2706400	2707720	You win the chatroom cookie.
2707720	2715340	Well, like I said, you know, it's a nice game, and you know, I hope that there's more to
2715340	2718040	it than just, you know, look at the pretty animals.
2718040	2723560	Well, I don't know, I'm looking, you know, I sort of think that I would play that, but
2723560	2728760	then again, I also did play a whole bunch of Pokemon Snap, but you know, something that
2728760	2736520	I will play, because I'm probably going to get a PS3, is Ninja Gaiden coming out on PS3.
2736520	2743040	According to Famitsu, there is going to be one called Ninja Gaiden Sigma, which you will
2743040	2748600	play as Rachel from Ninja Gaiden Black.
2748600	2754560	And it was actually also revealed that Itagaki was saying that there was going to be a Ninja
2754560	2760920	Gaiden 2, and it wasn't stating that it was the same project.
2760920	2767960	There's also a theory that this is going to be a remake of Ninja Gaiden Black with extras.
2767960	2772800	And there's also been no statement on if it's going to be specific just to the PS3 or if
2772800	2774120	it will see multiple systems.
2774120	2775880	I think it'll see multiple systems.
2775880	2776880	Probably.
2776880	2784520	I know Ninja Gaiden Black did really well on the Xbox, so I wouldn't see why they wouldn't
2784520	2785920	try to make a 360 version.
2785920	2789000	They've got a fan base.
2789000	2790000	Exactly.
2790000	2793840	There was actually some pretty cool stuff from Tokyo Game Show this week.
2793840	2798920	Microsoft is doing this brand new Bring It Home.
2798920	2802520	They're covering both Tokyo Game Show and X06, which is going to be taking place in
2802520	2805240	Barcelona next week.
2805240	2810400	Some pretty cool stuff though so far, we've had some demos, videos, themes, mainly just
2810400	2812480	kind of some of the stuff you don't get to see.
2812480	2817160	I like the demo thing because they did it during E3 and got some pretty good demos from
2817160	2818160	that.
2818160	2820440	Hopefully you're going to see some more stuff as far as demos go.
2820440	2824760	I know that there's Sonic the Hedgehog is supposed to be next week at some point, so
2824760	2826320	that'd be cool.
2826320	2829920	Maybe even some more Japanese exclusive demos would be nice because I get to play those
2829920	2832280	anyways.
2832280	2833440	Just stuff like that.
2833440	2839240	So I like how they're doing this and hopefully we'll see some more stuff that come out pretty
2839240	2840240	soon.
2840240	2846480	Well, as far as things that are coming out relatively soon, at the Tokyo Game Show, Microsoft
2846480	2852440	had a press release stating what new live arcade games were going to be coming out.
2852440	2859360	Included were Contra, Gyruss, Dig Dug, Track and Field, New Rally X, Russian Attack, Ms.
2859360	2865440	Pac-Man, and exclusive for the Japanese audience, Yaya Kung Fu.
2865440	2866440	That's pretty cool.
2866440	2870400	I wonder if I can play that since I have my Japanese account.
2870400	2871400	Don't bother.
2871400	2872400	I don't like Yaya Kung Fu.
2872400	2875480	I know a lot of people have a lot of love for that game.
2875480	2879400	I don't think it's this amazing fighting game people make it out to be.
2879400	2882080	It's what practically started the genre.
2882080	2883880	I'll try it.
2883880	2884880	I don't know.
2884880	2885880	Not my favorite.
2885880	2889520	I do have the free demo versions you can try out.
2889520	2892960	JIRUS, on the other hand, bring it.
2892960	2893960	Freaking love JIRUS.
2893960	2896760	I'm so there when JIRUS comes out.
2896760	2903360	Some interesting things were found out this week, or at least have been brought to light.
2903360	2910240	The fact that you can copy your Xbox Live arcade games onto a CD-R or DVD-R and be able
2910240	2912480	to play them on your system.
2912480	2913480	Why is this important?
2913480	2916720	Because not everyone out there has a hard drive for their system, as much as I'd like
2916720	2922240	to think so, and also that the memory units are quite limited on what you can put on there.
2922240	2929560	Now, there's a big, huge how-to on 360gamesaves.com if you want to know how to do this.
2929560	2930560	It's kind of funny.
2930560	2935000	One of the things that they actually have been able to do is pull off the full version
2935000	2941040	of Hexac HD, so if you don't have a hard drive, you can actually play it on your system.
2941040	2948000	It's basically as simple as bringing them into a certain directory structure on your
2948000	2952680	recordable media and basically popping it in, and they will populate your Xbox Live
2952680	2955400	arcade list there, which is pretty cool.
2955400	2959440	And if you do have them registered on your system, they will be the full version, otherwise
2959440	2962800	they are a demo.
2962800	2966120	So when might somebody want to actually use this?
2966120	2971440	If they don't have a hard drive, or if they're just stuck to just a simple memory unit, they
2971440	2977260	might, I don't know, if they have the extra cables or whatever to transfer them off the
2977260	2981680	memory unit onto, say, your computer, which that stuff is available out there.
2981680	2985960	I know Datel has kind of a cable for that.
2985960	2988260	That might be something that you can use this for.
2988260	2994520	Or say, if someone actually does the kind of not-legit thing and takes all the demos
2994520	3000200	and puts them on a disk image and distributes that over the internet, which would be cool.
3000200	3003480	And I think that should be something that Microsoft should do anyways, because I know
3003480	3008160	that, well, I know they were trying to push their Xbox Live arcade unplugged, but this
3008160	3011600	way if you could download all the demos, say, to a disk image, kind of like how they have
3011600	3015680	the backwards compatibility updates, that would be pretty cool as well.
3015680	3018840	You can just burn it onto the disk and then pop it in there and you have all the demos
3018840	3024400	for all the games, and then you can just register them, I guess, somehow.
3024400	3027400	That's kind of a problem if you don't have Live, I guess.
3027400	3030120	And how is piracy going to be prevented again?
3030120	3034200	The way piracy is prevented on it is actually that you're not going to be able to...
3034200	3038920	The games are only demo versions unless it's registered to your account.
3038920	3039920	Interesting.
3039920	3043600	Oh, yeah, because sometimes I start up Geometry Wars and it looks like it's a demo and then
3043600	3046480	suddenly it switches over and it says, oh, never mind, it's a demo version.
3046480	3050020	Yeah, because whether the register or not is based on your account.
3050020	3051840	You can't just download a registered version.
3051840	3052840	Gotcha.
3052840	3057800	All right, well, speaking of the 360, we have a very exciting announcement for the 360.
3057800	3061640	At least I know a lot of our import game fans are going to love this because these were
3061640	3062640	huge games.
3062640	3066000	Well, they were released here too, but it seems to appeal to that same audience.
3066000	3071000	Radiant Silver Gun and Ikarugan, you might recognize these two shooter titles.
3071000	3077120	Well, did you know that this was always planned to be a trilogy?
3077120	3078120	And guess what?
3078120	3085520	Treasure has announced that they will be making a third game in the series for the Xbox 360.
3085520	3086520	That's all we know.
3086520	3087520	Treasure loves us.
3087520	3088520	That's all we know.
3088520	3093760	We don't know when, where, how, what, we just know that Treasure's making it and it's coming
3093760	3094760	to the 360.
3094760	3097540	Dude, I love Radiant Silver Gun so much.
3097540	3099720	So now will you play your 360, Jamie?
3099720	3100720	Yes.
3100720	3102160	Oh, my God.
3102160	3107020	I played the hell out of Radiant Silver Gun at that one arcade in Las Vegas before they
3107020	3108240	shut down.
3108240	3109920	I was like, Radiant Silver Gun.
3109920	3111680	Everyone else was all playing Mambo A Go Go.
3111680	3113880	I'm like, screw that.
3113880	3114880	Radiant Silver Gun.
3114880	3116080	They couldn't get me off the machine.
3116080	3120260	What's interesting about that, I think, is that those games are usually very vertical
3120260	3126060	in nature, yet now the Xbox 360 supports widescreen and all their games have to support widescreen.
3126060	3130400	So it's going to be interesting what all that new horizontalness does to the game, don't
3130400	3131400	you think?
3131400	3135560	I actually used sort of for seeing something like, what was it, Thunder Force V. Didn't
3135560	3140040	that one have a lot of the rotational, where it would go one way and then rotate the other
3140040	3141040	way?
3141040	3144920	Maybe it wasn't Thunder Force V. Maybe I'm thinking of Vinehonder.
3144920	3148520	Vinehonder did a lot of vertical and horizontal scrolling in their games.
3148520	3149520	And Salamander.
3149520	3151720	Salamander actually did both, too.
3151720	3153500	Maybe they'll make a new Vinehonder.
3153500	3154500	It's about time.
3154500	3157000	If they did, it'd be Vinehonder.
3157000	3158000	Yeah.
3158000	3159000	Anyway.
3159000	3162320	So, how about some release dates, y'all?
3162320	3166940	Of course, we will start off with our UK release dates.
3166940	3169600	Some okay stuff, I guess.
3169600	3176200	You know, it would help if my laptop wouldn't come unplugged when I'm trying to pull up
3176200	3177200	the dates.
3177200	3178200	Sorry, guys.
3178200	3180800	I just got a little bit of a hang up.
3180800	3181800	Okay.
3181800	3182800	Yeah, the internet's acting funny tonight.
3182800	3185880	Our chat room's all crazy tonight, so live radio, folks.
3185880	3188360	The internet's not acting funny for me.
3188360	3192480	The fact that my computer came unplugged and my battery was going WTF.
3192480	3193640	Okay.
3193640	3197560	So how about our UK release dates, take two?
3197560	3203900	On the 25th, which it probably already is in the UK, Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2, March
3203900	3205640	of the Minis, coming out.
3205640	3213720	On the 29th, 42 all-time classics coming out on the DS, Age of Empires, Age of Kings, Black
3213720	3220680	Buccaneer on PC, Xbox, and Playstation 2, Company of Heroes on PC, Devil May Cry 3,
3220680	3227640	Dante's Awakening, Special Edition, that's a cool game, guys, get it, Infrared, and Kingdom
3227640	3232080	Hearts 2 coming out on Playstation 2, Mercury Meltdown also.
3232080	3235880	On the 30th, Mad Tracks coming out on Xbox 360.
3235880	3237600	Excellent.
3237600	3239200	There's some pretty cool stuff coming out.
3239200	3244040	I hope Mad Tracks is coming out, because that'd be pretty awesome, I want to play that.
3244040	3252360	Four, of course, I gotta mention this first, the big game for Playstation 2 this week,
3252360	3256440	Dance Dance Revolution, Supernova, of course, will be coming out.
3256440	3259800	I have heard, though, that the bundle might be delayed, so if you don't have a dance
3259800	3265480	pad yet, which I don't see why you wouldn't, you might be waiting a little bit.
3265480	3271880	Of course, on the Playstation 2, we also have, or actually, Playstation 2, Xbox, the 360,
3271880	3277840	and PSP, NBA Live 07, and then if you're not a fan of Live, NBA 2K7 is coming out on
3277840	3280280	Playstation 2, Xbox, and the 360.
3280280	3284800	If you're not a fan of basketball, maybe you're a fan of racing games, in which case,
3284800	3285920	you've got a couple things.
3285920	3289680	The first one's going to be The Fast and the Furious on Playstation 2, loosely based
3289680	3298680	on Tokyo Drift, and Import Tuner Challenge on the Xbox 360, which there was a rumor that
3298680	3304280	that was going to be $29.99 at Best Buy, that is a typo.
3304280	3309640	Then of course, Just Cause will be coming out on Xbox 360, the Xbox, and Playstation
3309640	3315320	2, as well as the PC, and some other fun stuff.
3315320	3320440	On the GameCube, Beethoven Kato's Origins will be coming out, one of the last role-playing
3320440	3324760	games actually made by Nintendo for the GameCube, so check that out.
3324760	3330260	As well as, the Game Boy Advance will be getting some re-releases, including Pokémon Fire
3330260	3339060	Red as part of the Greatest Hits, and Leaf Green, and of course, there's some pretty
3339060	3341760	good stuff coming out.
3341760	3345680	Import Bold Move Street Racing, if you're a racing fan on the Playstation 2, kind of
3345680	3349760	a budget game, and Greg Hastings' Tournament Paintball Max, which the game is about a year
3349760	3356240	old now, but still, you might want to play it in Valkyrie Profile 2, Cymera, on the Playstation
3356240	3357240	2.
3357240	3360120	Alright, well this is the part of the show where I would do Japanese release dates, but
3360120	3363840	the site I get Japanese release dates from is not working right now.
3363840	3364840	No problem then.
3364840	3365840	Oh, do you have it?
3365840	3367360	No, I'll just talk about some other stuff then.
3367360	3371400	Well no, I do remember too, because I remember looking at it and going, oh, I want to import
3371400	3372400	those.
3372400	3375840	Pop'n Music Carnival is this week in Japan, so if you're a big Pop'n Music fan, you've
3375840	3380000	got a new game coming out in Japan, and I know the first game in the new.hack series
3380000	3385440	is coming out this week, so if you were a fan of the.hack games,.hack infection, etc.,
3385440	3387680	the new series begins this week in Japan.
3387680	3390960	Sorry guys, I'll try to get the rest of them later in the show if they come up later.
3390960	3393840	I just think that's plenty, a game about an MMO.
3393840	3398840	And the game, like we like to do every week, a little piece of under the radar type of
3398840	3403400	stuff, we've got some dates for you for brand new games coming out from a company that I
3403400	3408280	really haven't heard of, Axis Games Localization, I guess they specialize in porting over some
3408280	3410280	stuff from Japan.
3410280	3414160	Some of the things you're going to see way distant future here, Guilty Gear for the Wii
3414160	3419200	is going to be coming out September 27th of next year, as well as a generic fishing game
3419200	3429200	on July 18th of 07, GISH for the PSP is coming out February 28th of 07, as well as a Guilty
3429200	3436000	Gear title for the Playstation 2, entitled right now Guilty Gear Series, but I guess
3436000	3440340	that's a working title for that, and that's coming out January 2nd, so look for those.
3440340	3446040	If you are in the market for some Xbox 360 games, there's been a few price drops, Quake
3446040	3451920	4 has dropped down to $39.99, as well as X-Men, the official game of the movie, has also dropped
3451920	3458320	down for $39.99, so check those out.
3458320	3460320	Alright, I will.
3460320	3463280	Okay, cool.
3463280	3468400	Anyways, other games that Japan is going to be seeing, and we're definitely going to be
3468400	3473160	seeing at some point, Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops, one of the cool things though that we
3473160	3478400	probably won't ever see over here, is going to be a Portable Ops bundle for the PSP, because
3478400	3482840	they're really trying to sell the PSP since they're getting their asses handed to them
3482840	3487160	by Nintendo with a DS.
3487160	3496840	The wonderful little bundle is going to include a snakeskin patterned case, as well as the
3496840	3500400	game and a fun little box that come with everything.
3500400	3505520	So if you haven't gotten a PSP already and you're thinking about doing so, definitely
3505520	3506520	check it out.
3506520	3509320	Kind of the box of cigarettes and snakes' favorite brand?
3509320	3510320	No?
3510320	3511320	Yeah.
3511320	3517520	Well, actually, it does come with an additional pouch with the logo for the game on it as
3517520	3525000	well, but other than that, no real any additional bonuses to it, other than kind of a cool looking
3525000	3526480	PSP box.
3526480	3529320	Airsoft sniper rifle, you know.
3529320	3537720	Anyway, well speaking of very cool things, Guitar Hero is going to be making it to multiple
3537720	3543720	formats in 2007, so that means that y'all who missed out are going to be having your
3543720	3545540	second chance.
3545540	3554700	It has been announced by the chairman of Activision that, and this is a quote, that it will appear
3554700	3562560	on every significant new format, while also going into some of the information about their
3562560	3569160	general plan from what it looks like, as far as some of their other titles.
3569160	3574200	There hasn't been an official comment by Red Octane, but they did state 2007, and also
3574200	3577800	Guitar Hero 2 is supposed to be out in November.
3577800	3579960	Doesn't that seem like a vague statement, though?
3579960	3581840	Every significant new platform?
3581840	3584320	Well, what's their idea of significant?
3584320	3585320	Exactly.
3585320	3586320	Maybe they just mean...
3586320	3587320	Maybe they like the Wonderswan.
3587320	3590800	Yeah, maybe they just mean it ain't coming for the Phantom, sorry.
3590800	3595800	Do not say hoo about the Wonderswan, because it had the best home version of Beatmania.
3595800	3600080	Well, best portable version of Beatmania.
3600080	3603300	Is this too much Guitar Hero?
3603300	3605520	Is this going to be an oversaturation of the market?
3605520	3606520	Nah.
3606520	3607520	Eh?
3607520	3608520	Yes.
3608520	3609520	Yes?
3609520	3610920	I just thought I'd say that.
3610920	3617680	I think so, because really, I think Guitar Hero is going to go the same path as Guitar
3617680	3623680	Freaks, where even though they still make tons of games for that, it's just, what are
3623680	3624680	you going to have?
3624680	3628320	You're not really going to be able to innovate on the gameplay any, so it's just going to
3628320	3636520	be brand new music each time around, and I guess DDR does change each game a little bit,
3636520	3637520	at least.
3637520	3639400	They change some of the gameplay stuff to it.
3639400	3643560	I mean, can't really change too much, because, I mean, the game is pretty simple, but they
3643560	3648720	do change a little bit of the, you know, kind of bonus type games, instead of the challenge
3648720	3653760	modes and stuff like that, so I guess they could add some of that in there, maybe?
3653760	3660040	I think they should do, like what Namco did with Soul Calibur II, is, you know, where
3660040	3664100	Soul Calibur II had different special characters on each game.
3664100	3668280	They have a certain packet of songs on each game that's exclusive to just that one.
3668280	3669280	God, no.
3669280	3671720	Buy them all.
3671720	3672720	Don't do that.
3672720	3675540	Yeah, but wouldn't that sell more games?
3675540	3676540	I don't know.
3676540	3677960	I think, you know, it would be sad.
3677960	3680080	I did own every version of Soul Calibur II.
3680080	3684680	I want to see how well II does, because, I mean, II, people are going to be having, you
3684680	3689920	know, the buy II, and they're going to be just like, they might just go, you know, okay,
3689920	3692040	I've seen this before, you know, who knows?
3692040	3693040	I don't know.
3693040	3695440	I think it's got a huge enough fan base, the game's going to do very well.
3695440	3699220	I think the game's going to do very, very well this Christmas.
3699220	3700380	What do I know?
3700380	3705640	I do know that an interesting story that somewhat relates to this is that a very interesting
3705640	3706640	purchase has been made.
3706640	3711360	Of course, a while ago, it kind of, you know, turned heads when Activision acquired Red
3711360	3712360	Octane.
3712360	3716400	Well, now, the other half of Guitar Hero is Harmonix.
3716400	3717880	They're the ones that actually developed the game.
3717880	3724640	Red Octane publishes it, but Harmonix developed it, and MTV Networks has purchased Harmonix.
3724640	3725640	Very interesting.
3725640	3726640	Yes, earlier this week.
3726640	3727640	Of the evil empire.
3727640	3732480	MTV announced a definitive agreement to acquire Harmonix Music Systems, developer of Guitar
3732480	3735080	Hero, on behalf of MTV.
3735080	3739240	Under the terms of the transaction, MTV acquires all of the outstanding stock of Harmonix for
3739240	3741680	$175 million in cash.
3741680	3746120	Harmonix shareholders may be eligible for incremental earn-out payments through 2008
3746120	3750100	to the extent that financial results exceed specific targets.
3750100	3754200	This is to demonstrate MTV's commitment to music.
3754200	3757000	You could play videos if you want to demonstrate that.
3757000	3762480	And furthers its strategy of engaging passionate music fans through a deep and immersive multi-platform
3762480	3764160	entertainment experience.
3764160	3766980	Summary, we're screwed.
3766980	3772560	By the way, this means that MTV Games logo will soon show up on Guitar Hero.
3772560	3774520	Should be interesting.
3774520	3778240	But could it allow them to get better licenses for the game?
3778240	3783320	Possibly, but I can't really see the game getting much better if MTV's label is lapped
3783320	3784320	on it.
3784320	3787640	Can they finally get Metallica?
3787640	3788640	I don't know.
3788640	3791880	Metallica can be kind of pissy when it comes to their music.
3791880	3793760	They're a little bit anal, but they're fine.
3793760	3795160	However, they are now on iTunes.
3795160	3797960	They are the divas of rock.
3797960	3798960	Seriously.
3798960	3799960	Alright.
3799960	3800960	Anyways.
3800960	3808920	Well, there's other music games out there, especially if you're in the UK.
3808920	3813900	One of those is going to be Sing Star Rocks, which Sony has announced the playlist for
3813900	3820880	this, including such wonderful tracks as The Killers, Somebody Told Me, Gwen Stefani Cool,
3820880	3828280	Fall Out Boy, Dance Dance, Coldplay, The Speed of Sound, as well as many other fun little
3828280	3833040	tracks there, Elton John, Rocketman, for all those who want to do a wonderful impression
3833040	3840740	of William Shatner, DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, Summertime, which I think is
3840740	3843720	pretty cool, Blur Song 2.
3843720	3844720	Blur!
3844720	3851600	Let's see, here's some other good- The resident Damon Auburn fangirl is going- Scissor Sisters,
3851600	3859600	Take Your Mama, The Police, Every Breath You Take, Stalker Song, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Sweet
3859600	3867080	Home Alabama, and just other fun stuff, Good Charlotte, Girls and Boys.
3867080	3870160	I remember playing that Sing Star game at E3.
3870160	3871720	Did you really?
3871720	3873980	We did Ace of Spades, me and some guy.
3873980	3877080	I think you guys were off doing that when we were looking at the Eye of Judgment.
3877080	3880640	Yeah, you guys were off doing the Eye of Judgment, and I was like, I want to play this.
3880640	3882280	Ooh, they have Motorhead.
3882280	3886080	Yeah, I remember at E3, because we were like, oh, we have to see this Eye of Judgment, because
3886080	3889920	it's supposed to be this revolutionary new thing, and you're like, oh, they did Sing
3889920	3890920	Star.
3890920	3894280	And then you come out of Sing Star and you're like, eeh, and then we come out of Eye of
3894280	3896040	Judgment, we're like, what the fuck was that?
3896040	3900200	I'm on a giddy after freaking blocking out to Motorhead at E3.
3900200	3902600	It's 15 minutes, I won't get back.
3902600	3908680	And then, hey, DMN, shut up, no ooh, Alabama, it's ooh, Alabama, because Alabama rocks.
3908680	3912320	One of the really assless people at the Eye of Judgment booth is like, what the hell is
3912320	3913320	this for?
3913320	3916600	You tried to, and they totally were like, ignoring you at one point, because you were
3916600	3921920	totally like, what the hell is this thing?
3921920	3922920	Good times.
3922920	3926760	Too bad there won't be an E3 next year, or, I'm sorry, in its current form.
3926760	3930020	Anyway, chat rooms yelling and bitching, I need to make this crush, and the MTV logo
3930020	3932080	already appears on Guitar Hero 1.
3932080	3937720	Sorry, I haven't, the last time I played Guitar Hero 1 was at E3, because it was one of the
3937720	3941960	games they had at Arena, and you know, it seems like every time you go into Arena, somebody's
3941960	3945360	playing Guitar Hero, so that's the last time I played it, and I didn't get to see the boot
3945360	3946800	up sequence at that time.
3946800	3951720	So maybe the signs of this acquisition were a long time coming then, you could infer from
3951720	3952720	that.
3952720	3954440	So, sorry for my oversight, you can flog me later.
3954440	3960080	I'm sure that the MTV logo being on the game is only going to make the game better.
3960080	3963160	Ooh, MTV!
3963160	3965040	Instantly my brain has turned to jello!
3965040	3970000	If anything, all it will do is help promote the game, that's about it, they will be able
3970000	3975400	to promote it more on their shows, and do their own Guitar Hero, be a Guitar Hero TV
3975400	3977680	contest thing, or whatever, I don't know.
3977680	3981840	Having the MTV logo on Guitar Hero makes it lose instant cool points.
3981840	3984560	Repeat what you said, Drew Nami, because you didn't have a mic.
3984560	3987760	Ooh, we might just be playing the jackass theme on Guitar Hero.
3987760	3993360	Or yeah, they'll combine some of their franchises here, you know, what is that show, My Sweet
3993360	3997760	Sixteen Guitar Hero, whatever that fucking show is with the spoiled brats.
3997760	4000120	Hi, guess he doesn't watch TV.
4000120	4003240	You know what, I don't watch it very much either, but it's kind of one of those things
4003240	4008960	when your roommate's watching Next, you can't help but kind of look and go, God damn, I
4008960	4011080	weep for the youth of America.
4011080	4015000	It's okay, what's next, we gonna see Beavis and Butthead in the crowd?
4015000	4019080	That would be cool, that would be cool, because I like Beavis and Butthead.
4019080	4020080	Actually that would be cool.
4020080	4025240	Or like have like some sort of like New Age thing, no not New Age, like New Wave and then
4025240	4027280	have like Daria hanging out on the side.
4027280	4028280	Or Nine Inch Nails concert.
4028280	4033920	Geeta in our chat room says, this is the true story of seven gamers picked to play a game
4033920	4038320	and have their lives taped.
4038320	4043160	Pull the gun trigger now, point it in my head and pull the trigger.
4043160	4046480	Moving on to other music game news, this is a little bit exciting, but yet at the same
4046480	4047480	time disappointing.
4047480	4053920	Word is coming via joystick from their hands on of Parappa the Rappa on the PSP.
4053920	4058560	The PSP demo for Parappa the Rappa, which we reported last week is coming to the PSP,
4058560	4063920	it's the exact same demo that the PS1 Parappa the Rappa used, which makes us think Parappa
4063920	4069360	the Rappa on PSP is just going to be a frickin port of Parappa the Rappa PlayStation.
4069360	4073320	And while Parappa the Rappa is a great game and it'll help expose it to a new generation,
4073320	4077920	old school fans like myself and I'm sure the others in this room can't help but weep a
4077920	4080160	little bit at this news.
4080160	4084440	Now there is some silver lining to this, the graphics have been cleaned up, the audio is
4084440	4090040	a little bit crisper, the rapping guy Parappa of course still stutters, you know when you
4090040	4093100	don't hit the buttons right, but I think that's kind of what they're supposed to do.
4093100	4098180	Now supposedly though there is going to be a multiplayer mode, which could, you know,
4098180	4100640	make this game the must own, I don't know.
4100640	4104400	But it should also be pointed out that there's cute little Parappa stickers for the PSP and
4104400	4110080	I look at that and I go I want one right now, right now, that's hot.
4110080	4113240	Consumer horror, and hell.
4113240	4119920	Alright we're going to bring this part A to a close here, but first we've got DDR sneak
4119920	4124320	peeks for you guys, that's right here on Orange Launch Radio, we've been previewing new DDR
4124320	4128440	games that are coming out very soon, UltraMix 4 a little later this year as well as DDR
4128440	4134320	Universe sometime this winter at some point and we've been playing about four songs a
4134320	4136280	week and we're going to continue that tonight.
4136280	4140640	We've got two songs from DDR UltraMix 4 and DDR Universe to play for you guys.
4140640	4143560	Let's start it off with a long version because we've been throwing some long versions in
4143560	4144560	here.
4144560	4148420	This is a song that's going to be included in DDR UltraMix 4 and it's by an artist named
4148420	4153120	Rupesh Kartel and this I believe is a license from the A Different Drum label and this is
4153120	4154120	a pretty cool song.
4154120	4159360	It's called Yours to Command, it's a little bit of a slow jam, enjoy this one here on
4159360	4160360	Orange Launch Radio, DDR sneak peeks.
4160360	4181640	I was deleting all connections to life in this town, sitting questioning just about
4181640	4197560	everything I've tried and I didn't need solutions, you'd be wanting me to buy, as the ring fell
4197560	4215920	on the ground.
4215920	4234360	Out in the quiet on the wet streets, reflecting red and blue
4234360	4250360	Setting off to see while nothing old and nothing new From the east side to the west side, I'm moving in the calm Here are pieces I've been missing for so long
4250360	4268860	Come in determination, I'm yours to command Come true intimidation, I'm yours to command
4268860	4284860	Come in determination, I'm yours to command I'm yours to command
4298860	4323860	Come true determination, I'm yours to command
4323860	4352860	Come in determination, I'm yours to command Come true intimidation, I'm yours to command
4352860	4359860	From DDR UltraMix IV, that is Rupesh Cartel with Yours to Command here on Orange Lounge Radio, the DDR Sneak Peaks.
4359860	4362860	Kind of 80s reminiscent, that song. That's kind of cool.
4362860	4367860	It'll probably have a pretty easy step chart, but that's okay. The noobs need something to play, and that's a good song, I think.
4367860	4375860	Alright, we're going to go and do another song, and this song is from DDR Universe, and I have a feeling this might be a little bit of a controversial song,
4375860	4382860	because they've taken an old Konami classic and really remixed the heck out of it, so it's interesting.
4382860	4389860	Imagine your favorite gothic whipping game of all time with a big band swing sound.
4389860	4396860	Yeah, I'm not even kidding. It's Castlevania, the freestyle and mix, wave group featuring Nicky G.
4396860	4400860	See what you think. This is coming to DDR Universe here on the Orange Lounge Radio Sneak Peaks.
4400860	4407860	This is coming to DDR Universe here on the Orange Lounge Radio Sneak Peaks.
4430860	4437860	This is coming to DDR Universe.
4460860	4467860	This is coming to DDR Universe.
4490860	4510860	Castlevania, the freestyle and mix here on Orange Lounge Radio, DDR Sneak Peaks.
4510860	4514860	Kind of interesting. I haven't heard anything quite like that before.
4514860	4520860	I've heard plenty like it. I have the Saturn version of Symphony of the Night, or I should say Nocturne in the Moonlight,
4520860	4526860	and if you play as Richter or Maria when you go into the lobby there of the castle,
4526860	4531860	you actually get either Vampire Killer or I think Bloodlines, depending on who you play.
4531860	4536860	I think Maria gets Vampire Killer, and it's sort of a similar mix to that.
4536860	4543860	Also, that style of music has shown up in Dracula X on the PC Engine Duo.
4543860	4550860	But you can't help but imagine Alucard in the shiny jacket getting down all BG style, right?
4550860	4553860	This is nothing new from Konami.
4553860	4557860	Interesting mixed reaction from the chat room there to that, though,
4557860	4559860	because I bet a lot of people probably haven't heard that same thing you have,
4559860	4560860	and some people in the chat room are kind of like...
4560860	4562860	Bloody Tears, that was the other one.
4562860	4566860	That's a little bit of a weird sound, but some other people are like, wow, I really dig that.
4566860	4570860	It's like most DDR song lists. There's going to be some songs you love and some songs you don't like so much,
4570860	4571860	but there's something for everyone.
4571860	4575860	That was right, Maria gets Bloody Tears, and that was...
4575860	4577860	I haven't played that game in like a year.
4577860	4581860	Chat room is also yelling that we're not acknowledging Supernova that's coming out next week,
4581860	4585860	and should I point out, Loki actually already mentioned it, hello, in his upcoming releases,
4585860	4588860	but you guys already have heard the Supernova VR at this point.
4588860	4590860	We don't have anything new for you regarding that,
4590860	4595860	but we do have something new for you from DDR UltraMix 4, another track here.
4595860	4599860	This is a song called Electric Air, and it's by an artist called Amit,
4599860	4602860	and it's a simple four-letter name there, A-M-I-T, Amit,
4602860	4630860	and it's called Electric Air here on the DDR Sneak Previews. Check it out, Orange Launch Radio.
4662860	4679860	I see a rush in the shade, yeah
4679860	4708860	That was Electric Air by Amit here on Orange Launch Radio, DDR Sneak Peaks.
4708860	4713860	One more song for you guys tonight, and if you guys played DDR UltraMix 2,
4713860	4718860	or heck, if you've played some of those import mixes from Japan of BeatMania 2DX,
4718860	4723860	then you might know a little song called Toe Jam that was a very interesting little song,
4723860	4726860	kind of a little bit of country hoedown by Big Idea.
4726860	4732860	Well, guess what? Big Idea is back in DDR universe, and so is Toe Jam.
4732860	4736860	This is our last song tonight. It's Big Idea with Return of the Toe Jam
4736860	4739860	here on the Orange Launch Radio Sneak Peaks.
4796860	4806860	Big Idea with Return of the Toe Jam
4826860	4846860	Return of the Toe Jam by Big Idea coming soon to DDR universe.
4846860	4848860	That was cool.
4848860	4857860	I expect Minnie Pearl to come out towards the end of that song and go, hi!
4857860	4863860	It's interesting, I think a lot of the songs we've played tonight kind of have this common theme
4863860	4868860	where some people probably really liked it and some people didn't like it so much,
4868860	4873860	but hopefully there was one of those four, at least if not three, that you really dug.
4873860	4879860	Me personally, I kind of dug them all. Trust me, if I thought one of them sucked, I'd tell you,
4879860	4883860	but I think they're all pretty cool, so the game should be interesting.
4883860	4890860	I have actually done square dancing when I was younger, much younger.
4890860	4893860	Now that's what Konami needs, square dance revolution.
4893860	4895860	Square dancing is actually kind of fun.
4895860	4898860	You know what? I used to look forward to that in P.E.,
4898860	4901860	because it was like, hey, we were in the gym for two weeks.
4901860	4907860	DJ Tyrant said that song delivers. I wonder if he means deliverance.
4907860	4909860	Yeah, real pretty ass.
4909860	4914860	Yeah, when the DDR announcer tells me to squeal like a pig, that's when I'm going to stop playing.
4914860	4917860	I actually haven't square danced since I was in fourth grade, by the way.
4917860	4919860	Really? We did it in high school.
4919860	4923860	Konami, are you listening? Square dance revolution, make it happen, come on.
4923860	4926860	They gave us karaoke revolution country.
4926860	4928860	Karaoke revolution country sold, didn't it?
4928860	4931860	We had it at E3, though, so I could sing Good Old Boys.
4931860	4932860	Oh, give me a break.
4932860	4935860	To get my Dukes of Hazzard on.
4935860	4939860	I think I played it at Konami Gamers' Day and there was some Shania song.
4939860	4941860	I sung it, I think. I can't remember.
4941860	4943860	Shania is awesome.
4943860	4945860	Do I even know you two anymore?
4945860	4946860	Apparently.
4946860	4948860	Dude, line dancing revolution. See, there's a difference.
4948860	4956860	Line dancing is kind of like stupid cheerleading para para, but square dancing is kind of cool.
4956860	4960860	Alright, we need to go take a break so we can reminisce some more.
4960860	4986860	So that's going to do it for our part A, but we'll be back in a little bit with part B of our podcast.
