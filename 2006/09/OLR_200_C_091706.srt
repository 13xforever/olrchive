00:00:00,487 --> 00:00:19,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:26,089
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this very special Part C to celebrate our 200th episode.

3
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:31,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I want to warn you guys, if this is your first time downloading Orange Lounge Radio, this is going to be a little bit different.

4
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:44,577
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not your typical segment of Orange Lounge Radio, so I urge you to check out OrangeLoungeRadio.com and dip back in our podcast feed and check out Parts A and B. We envision this section of the show to be a little more like our afterbirth segment.

5
00:00:44,617 --> 00:00:46,218
[SPEAKER_03]: For those that listen live, you know what that is.

6
00:00:46,278 --> 00:00:48,219
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bonus thing we do just for the live listeners.

7
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,720
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have a little bit more game news.

8
00:00:50,760 --> 00:01:02,583
[SPEAKER_03]: We just filled up with stuff in Part B and just had a little more we wanted to talk about here in Part C. But first, before we get to that gaming news, what we did is we brought in a little bit of champagne.

9
00:01:02,643 --> 00:01:04,724
[SPEAKER_03]: I promised there would be liquor tonight in one form or another.

10
00:01:05,624 --> 00:01:07,745
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do a toast here to our 200th episode.

11
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:10,305
[SPEAKER_03]: So does anyone want to make the toast or should I just do it or what?

12
00:01:10,325 --> 00:01:11,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone want to say a little bit?

13
00:01:11,486 --> 00:01:11,986
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

14
00:01:12,186 --> 00:01:12,406
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

15
00:01:12,711 --> 00:01:13,892
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

16
00:01:42,133 --> 00:01:43,574
[SPEAKER_03]: That's some good Korbel.

17
00:01:46,977 --> 00:01:48,078
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not a big champagne fan?

18
00:01:48,578 --> 00:01:52,221
[SPEAKER_21]: I like champagne, but I really like it in a good mimosa.

19
00:01:55,744 --> 00:01:58,287
[SPEAKER_21]: When we reach 300, we toast Guinness.

20
00:01:58,467 --> 00:01:59,948
[SPEAKER_03]: 250 is a big number too, I don't know.

21
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:04,732
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's going to be more at the 5th birthday, because 5th birthday is pretty big, so we'll see.

22
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,454
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, Jamie already burped the Korbel.

23
00:02:09,514 --> 00:02:10,235
[SPEAKER_03]: That's amazing.

24
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:11,356
[SPEAKER_22]: That's some fizzy stuff.

25
00:02:11,376 --> 00:02:12,217
[SPEAKER_03]: That is amazing.

26
00:02:12,537 --> 00:02:15,881
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we have a little bit of extra stories here for you guys.

27
00:02:15,921 --> 00:02:16,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki?

28
00:02:16,782 --> 00:02:24,089
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, lots of fun stuff for Part C. Anyways, I really shouldn't be paying attention.

29
00:02:24,169 --> 00:02:25,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, chat room, for your well wishes, by the way.

30
00:02:28,205 --> 00:02:30,187
[SPEAKER_29]: There's been a lot of rumors going around about the 360.

31
00:02:31,488 --> 00:02:38,853
[SPEAKER_29]: One that keeps popping back up is Microsoft's going to release a brand new 360 with an internal HD DVD drive.

32
00:02:39,892 --> 00:02:42,213
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, once again, they have said no.

33
00:02:42,513 --> 00:02:46,454
[SPEAKER_29]: We are not releasing a SKU with an HD DVD drive.

34
00:02:46,494 --> 00:02:59,659
[SPEAKER_29]: It says, turns out you want to say in how you spend your, or turns out you want to say in how you spend your entertainment dollars, so who are the ones, or, so who are we to burden every customer with the cost of expensive movie technology?

35
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,100
[SPEAKER_29]: Ooh!

36
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,681
[SPEAKER_29]: Serve, Sony!

37
00:03:04,981 --> 00:03:05,101
Ouch.

38
00:03:07,008 --> 00:03:10,030
[SPEAKER_03]: That was Bill Gates whipping it out right there.

39
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,272
[SPEAKER_29]: No, that was actually a generic Microsoft employee.

40
00:03:14,412 --> 00:03:17,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, that was a Microsoft employee whipping out their cock.

41
00:03:17,394 --> 00:03:18,955
[SPEAKER_21]: No, that was one of their technical writers.

42
00:03:19,696 --> 00:03:20,096
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

43
00:03:21,036 --> 00:03:22,978
[SPEAKER_21]: This is why I'm in school, to be a tech writer.

44
00:03:23,998 --> 00:03:24,258
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

45
00:03:24,278 --> 00:03:26,360
[SPEAKER_21]: So that I, too, can whip out the corporate cock.

46
00:03:30,482 --> 00:03:32,203
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't need a corporate cock, I just need a cock.

47
00:03:33,464 --> 00:03:34,425
[SPEAKER_21]: Your girlfriend's is still bigger.

48
00:03:34,825 --> 00:03:35,045
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway.

49
00:03:35,065 --> 00:03:35,145
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

50
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:40,796
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, Megzi!

51
00:03:41,857 --> 00:03:42,517
[SPEAKER_21]: We love you!

52
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:54,065
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, there is actually the GameU College Tour will be making the rounds.

53
00:03:54,145 --> 00:03:58,287
[SPEAKER_21]: It will be featuring the Xbox 360, Xbox, and PC gaming.

54
00:03:58,888 --> 00:04:00,228
[SPEAKER_21]: The tour will last three months.

55
00:04:02,377 --> 00:04:05,480
[SPEAKER_21]: and it will hit up 40 different college campuses.

56
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:13,206
[SPEAKER_21]: It's produced by Game Informer, Norsent TV and Mountain Dew and a bunch of other folks.

57
00:04:13,906 --> 00:04:18,810
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's going to hopefully reach 90,000 different people.

58
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:28,378
[SPEAKER_21]: Some of the titles that are included are Madden NFL 07, blah, blah, blah, Rainbow Six, Saints Row, Mortal Kombat, Armageddon,

59
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:35,880
[SPEAKER_21]: America's Army Special Forces, Splinter Cell Double Agent, blah blah blah, Project Gotham 3, Dead Rising.

60
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,244
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, all the games Jamie does not enjoy playing.

61
00:04:38,465 --> 00:04:39,126
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, Dead Rising!

62
00:04:39,507 --> 00:04:40,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's cool.

63
00:04:40,428 --> 00:04:41,450
[SPEAKER_21]: Dead Rising was hot.

64
00:04:43,095 --> 00:04:47,779
[SPEAKER_21]: And there will be a Madden NFL 07 football field goal competition.

65
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,622
[SPEAKER_21]: And the winners take home $1,000 as the prize.

66
00:04:51,803 --> 00:04:58,248
[SPEAKER_21]: And Game Informer will have a Halo 2 competition each place with an unnamed prize, it seems.

67
00:04:58,809 --> 00:05:04,634
[SPEAKER_21]: So the tour starts on September 14th at the University of Arizona in Tucson.

68
00:05:06,255 --> 00:05:08,897
[SPEAKER_21]: Other schools that will be visited will be...

69
00:05:10,735 --> 00:05:11,555
[SPEAKER_21]: Just general places.

70
00:05:11,755 --> 00:05:17,217
[SPEAKER_21]: They will be going to Austin, Texas, University of Texas, University of Missouri, Wichita State.

71
00:05:17,798 --> 00:05:18,818
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just listing a few.

72
00:05:18,878 --> 00:05:25,280
[SPEAKER_21]: Vanderbilt, Northern Kentucky, Temple University, Penn State.

73
00:05:26,341 --> 00:05:31,703
[SPEAKER_21]: They'll be going to, I guess, State University of New York.

74
00:05:31,923 --> 00:05:32,483
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that what it is?

75
00:05:34,004 --> 00:05:34,504
[SPEAKER_21]: In Buffalo.

76
00:05:35,224 --> 00:05:37,065
[SPEAKER_21]: And Miami University of Ohio.

77
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:38,906
[SPEAKER_21]: That always makes me laugh.

78
00:05:38,966 --> 00:05:39,966
[SPEAKER_21]: And, of course, Notre Dame.

79
00:05:41,103 --> 00:05:43,146
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

80
00:05:43,827 --> 00:05:48,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if the game isn't coming to you, maybe you need to bring the game with you everywhere you go.

81
00:05:49,034 --> 00:05:51,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, you know those little plug-and-play things, right?

82
00:05:51,096 --> 00:05:52,879
[SPEAKER_03]: The little joysticks you can plug into your TV.

83
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:54,641
[SPEAKER_03]: You see them sell these at Target all the time, right?

84
00:05:55,014 --> 00:05:58,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, these things are getting smaller and smaller, and now check this out.

85
00:05:58,495 --> 00:06:01,295
[SPEAKER_03]: They now have keychain plug-and-plays.

86
00:06:01,715 --> 00:06:09,076
[SPEAKER_03]: A little teeny Atari joystick and a little teeny Atari paddle that you can take with you to play games on the go.

87
00:06:09,877 --> 00:06:11,337
[SPEAKER_03]: They have actual games in these.

88
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:14,297
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an included six-foot cable that comes with it.

89
00:06:14,637 --> 00:06:20,098
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on a battery-powered reel, and you put it on the keychain here, and then you can plug it in and play.

90
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:23,099
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one joystick that will have asteroids and millipede,

91
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:29,181
[SPEAKER_03]: another with Centipede and Yar's Revenge, and then the paddle will have Pong, Breakout, and Warlords.

92
00:06:29,921 --> 00:06:30,782
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.

93
00:06:31,622 --> 00:06:35,983
[SPEAKER_03]: The keychain comes with a separate pocket-sized reel that holds six feet of cords and RCA jacks.

94
00:06:36,304 --> 00:06:41,966
[SPEAKER_03]: It's powered by three AAA batteries, single player only, however, since it is just a little keychain.

95
00:06:42,366 --> 00:06:42,686
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.

96
00:06:42,706 --> 00:06:45,827
[SPEAKER_21]: I wonder what the original Atari programmers think of these.

97
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,381
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I gotta wonder.

98
00:06:47,401 --> 00:06:53,323
[SPEAKER_21]: That's at Next Classic Gaming Expo that they do, because, you know, they skipped a year for Classic Gaming Expo so they could do the 10th anniversary.

99
00:06:53,503 --> 00:06:53,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

100
00:06:53,864 --> 00:06:57,465
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm definitely going and I'm going to ask them what they think of that, because that's just crazy.

101
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:05,409
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68 says, I'm left-handed, I demand a lefty stick or I will refuse to buy Atari 2600 or related crap.

102
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,031
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTetsuya in our chat says, shame the paddle won't link up with three others.

103
00:07:09,871 --> 00:07:11,092
[SPEAKER_03]: So, sad.

104
00:07:12,242 --> 00:07:16,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, what we're going to do now, I think that was about all the gaming news we have.

105
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,648
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get some last minute stories in a minute if any folks have stuff.

106
00:07:19,668 --> 00:07:21,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, first, we have these.

107
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:23,791
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to play these since we are celebrating our 200th episode.

108
00:07:24,352 --> 00:07:28,135
[SPEAKER_03]: We got sent a surprise from All Games, our buddies at All Games.

109
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:31,357
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I was going to go ahead and play this so we could hear this.

110
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,761
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, Krop, did you hear the news?

111
00:07:37,542 --> 00:07:37,902
[SPEAKER_23]: What news?

112
00:07:38,643 --> 00:07:41,365
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lounge Radio is doing their 200th episode this week.

113
00:07:42,185 --> 00:07:42,445
[SPEAKER_23]: What?

114
00:07:44,386 --> 00:07:42,445
200?

115
00:07:45,026 --> 00:07:46,486
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

116
00:07:47,247 --> 00:07:49,667
[SPEAKER_28]: Nice dedication for you.

117
00:07:49,687 --> 00:07:50,127
[SPEAKER_28]: 200 shows.

118
00:07:50,147 --> 00:07:50,127
200.

119
00:07:50,287 --> 00:07:52,348
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a lot.

120
00:07:52,368 --> 00:07:53,849
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, it is.

121
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:59,110
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you think we'll ever reach that level of dedication?

122
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:01,351
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, my contract is only for 30.

123
00:08:03,231 --> 00:08:03,952
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a contract?

124
00:08:03,972 --> 00:08:04,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops.

125
00:08:10,788 --> 00:08:18,792
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey there, this is Scott from All Games Interactive wishing the guys and girls at Orange Lounge Radio a happy 200th episode.

126
00:08:19,292 --> 00:08:22,954
[SPEAKER_00]: Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki, you guys kick ass.

127
00:08:22,974 --> 00:08:28,637
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, to celebrate, we are going to spend the next four days playing DDR and listening to DDR music.

128
00:08:28,917 --> 00:08:35,100
[SPEAKER_00]: So, from everyone here at the Arena Lounge... Congratulations, OLR!

129
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,321
[SPEAKER_00]: ...on 200 episodes.

130
00:08:36,341 --> 00:08:37,141
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys rock.

131
00:08:37,702 --> 00:08:39,162
[SPEAKER_14]: I love you.

132
00:08:43,638 --> 00:08:47,320
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you realize how cool it'd be if I could actually play V and have it sound like this?

133
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,881
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, anyway, Bobby Blackwolf here from that show that comes on before you guys.

134
00:08:51,401 --> 00:08:51,861
[SPEAKER_28]: 200, eh?

135
00:08:52,382 --> 00:08:53,002
[SPEAKER_28]: Y'all cheated.

136
00:08:53,642 --> 00:08:55,463
[SPEAKER_28]: Counting all those years of internet radio and all.

137
00:08:55,943 --> 00:08:58,864
[SPEAKER_28]: But don't worry, Scott's funky episode numbering will catch up in about a month.

138
00:08:59,545 --> 00:09:03,826
[SPEAKER_28]: But seriously, y'all were one of the reasons I started podcasting and I enjoy you guys each week.

139
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:06,187
[SPEAKER_28]: Good luck to all of you in the future.

140
00:09:06,768 --> 00:09:09,049
[SPEAKER_28]: And make sure it doesn't go downhill from here.

141
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:11,990
[SPEAKER_28]: Someone had to say it.

142
00:09:15,543 --> 00:09:16,743
[SPEAKER_28]: That was wonderful.

143
00:09:16,943 --> 00:09:18,004
[SPEAKER_03]: That was so cute.

144
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:18,864
[SPEAKER_03]: That was so cute.

145
00:09:18,924 --> 00:09:20,084
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what else to say.

146
00:09:20,324 --> 00:09:23,705
[SPEAKER_21]: Just the thing that had me cracking was, you had a contract?

147
00:09:24,025 --> 00:09:26,206
[SPEAKER_03]: That was Kropotkin and Hendrix from the show Between Us.

148
00:09:26,506 --> 00:09:30,127
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, who were all those people at Arena yelling in the background there?

149
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:31,747
[SPEAKER_03]: That was kind of interesting.

150
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:32,788
[SPEAKER_03]: They hired people.

151
00:09:33,288 --> 00:09:35,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they must have hired stand-ins to do that.

152
00:09:35,268 --> 00:09:35,849
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

153
00:09:35,869 --> 00:09:38,309
[SPEAKER_21]: Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

154
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:38,489
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

155
00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:39,830
[SPEAKER_21]: I want my second glass of champagne.

156
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:41,970
[SPEAKER_29]: Good for you.

157
00:09:43,431 --> 00:09:44,511
[SPEAKER_29]: Did you want my glass of champagne?

158
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,631
[SPEAKER_21]: That was unintentional.

159
00:10:02,222 --> 00:10:03,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Scott's full of shit sometimes.

160
00:10:04,323 --> 00:10:06,004
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if he's really going to do, yeah, sometimes.

161
00:10:06,284 --> 00:10:08,405
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if he's really going to do four days of DDR.

162
00:10:08,725 --> 00:10:10,285
[SPEAKER_03]: I cannot picture him playing DDR.

163
00:10:10,566 --> 00:10:12,666
[SPEAKER_03]: But if they do, is Black Boy still listening?

164
00:10:13,027 --> 00:10:13,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, I don't think he is.

165
00:10:13,787 --> 00:10:15,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody videotape it over at Arena Lounge.

166
00:10:16,868 --> 00:10:19,929
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn it, that Rob shit in the chat room needs to stop right now.

167
00:10:22,951 --> 00:10:24,091
[SPEAKER_03]: They are just flooding our chat.

168
00:10:24,111 --> 00:10:26,332
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I've done that since, like, what, episode one?

169
00:10:26,372 --> 00:10:27,453
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.

170
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:28,213
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

171
00:10:28,874 --> 00:10:33,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, all games, we love those guys, and thank you guys so much for getting in on that and putting that together for us.

172
00:10:33,518 --> 00:10:34,099
[SPEAKER_03]: That was awesome.

173
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Our fans also decided to ambush our voicemail line this week.

174
00:10:38,843 --> 00:10:40,104
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, we have fans on our website too.

175
00:10:40,344 --> 00:10:44,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we had some voicemails hit our voicemail line this week, so we're going to play that as well.

176
00:10:45,109 --> 00:10:47,130
[SPEAKER_23]: Hello, Orange Lounge Radio.

177
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,773
[SPEAKER_23]: Happy 200th episode.

178
00:10:50,493 --> 00:10:51,174
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

179
00:10:51,915 --> 00:10:52,976
[SPEAKER_23]: I love you guys.

180
00:10:53,776 --> 00:10:54,617
[SPEAKER_23]: You're a lover.

181
00:10:55,098 --> 00:10:55,238
[SPEAKER_23]: No.

182
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:02,454
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm calling to congratulate you guys on your 200th episode.

183
00:11:23,553 --> 00:11:34,995
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know many podcasts at all, I'll be honest, but you guys have been around for a while, I've heard about you for a while, I just started being a part of the station in a bigger way, and I love you guys.

184
00:11:35,335 --> 00:11:37,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep up the good work, here's to another 200.

185
00:11:37,095 --> 00:11:39,196
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys all take care.

186
00:11:39,336 --> 00:11:40,456
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, it's Miss Steve.

187
00:11:52,765 --> 00:12:01,409
[SPEAKER_22]: and I'm pretty certain that I'm going to be listening tonight anyway, but I just wanted to say in a more personal way, congrats on reaching episode 200.

188
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,210
[SPEAKER_22]: Bye.

189
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:06,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

190
00:12:06,612 --> 00:12:07,532
[SPEAKER_03]: That was really sweet, you guys.

191
00:12:07,552 --> 00:12:08,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

192
00:12:11,274 --> 00:12:18,978
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I like the guy, I think it was Yuri Lever who sounded like he was talking and he just had this... Red vs. Blue, who is that?

193
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:20,331
[SPEAKER_19]: Caboose!

194
00:12:20,371 --> 00:12:20,791
[SPEAKER_19]: Caboose!

195
00:12:20,851 --> 00:12:21,792
[SPEAKER_19]: He sounded like Caboose!

196
00:12:23,153 --> 00:12:24,974
[SPEAKER_19]: I have to go to the bathroom now.

197
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:25,174
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh-oh.

198
00:12:25,194 --> 00:12:25,274
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

199
00:12:25,294 --> 00:12:26,035
[SPEAKER_21]: What'd he say?

200
00:12:26,115 --> 00:12:26,835
[SPEAKER_21]: Are you getting it?

201
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:27,976
[SPEAKER_21]: We can't hear it.

202
00:12:27,996 --> 00:12:33,120
[SPEAKER_19]: We can't hear it.

203
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:33,681
[SPEAKER_19]: What's he saying?

204
00:12:33,701 --> 00:12:35,362
[SPEAKER_21]: Just tell us what he's saying.

205
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:35,462
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

206
00:12:49,349 --> 00:12:50,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, put on speakerphone.

207
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:51,590
[SPEAKER_03]: One second.

208
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,551
[SPEAKER_03]: We warned you guys it would be random.

209
00:12:53,571 --> 00:12:53,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

210
00:12:55,592 --> 00:12:56,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this your husband?

211
00:12:56,332 --> 00:12:56,833
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Dan.

212
00:12:56,893 --> 00:12:57,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

213
00:12:57,633 --> 00:12:58,033
[SPEAKER_21]: Say it again.

214
00:12:59,634 --> 00:13:02,815
Congratulations on your 200th episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

215
00:13:03,356 --> 00:13:05,657
Man, I didn't think you'd make it to, you know, two.

216
00:13:05,677 --> 00:13:07,017
We didn't think we'd make it to two either.

217
00:13:07,057 --> 00:13:07,198
Wow.

218
00:13:07,218 --> 00:13:08,558
That was nice.

219
00:13:08,618 --> 00:13:09,979
[SPEAKER_23]: Everybody's getting in on the love.

220
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:10,699
You're still on speakerphone.

221
00:13:22,328 --> 00:13:23,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Close the damn phone.

222
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,229
[SPEAKER_03]: We got other stuff to get to.

223
00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:25,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell him to wait.

224
00:13:25,249 --> 00:13:26,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye, sweetie.

225
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:27,811
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

226
00:13:30,112 --> 00:13:30,432
[SPEAKER_21]: Dork.

227
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:33,353
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I'm saying this on the radio.

228
00:13:33,434 --> 00:13:34,694
[SPEAKER_21]: My husband is a dork.

229
00:13:35,695 --> 00:13:36,855
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, he buys you pinball.

230
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:39,777
[SPEAKER_21]: But he brings me pinball, so that's why I keep him around.

231
00:13:40,537 --> 00:13:41,458
[SPEAKER_03]: This is great radio.

232
00:13:41,498 --> 00:13:43,219
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're all drinking champagne.

233
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:43,579
[SPEAKER_03]: What can I say?

234
00:13:43,599 --> 00:13:44,980
[SPEAKER_21]: This is the second time Dan's been on the show.

235
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,360
[SPEAKER_03]: This is great champagne.

236
00:13:47,801 --> 00:13:49,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Any last-minute stories tonight?

237
00:13:49,082 --> 00:13:49,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

238
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:51,715
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, of course I have stuff.

239
00:13:51,895 --> 00:13:56,816
[SPEAKER_29]: Anyways, the first thing I want to talk about is release dates, because of course I have stuff.

240
00:13:57,296 --> 00:14:01,617
[SPEAKER_29]: And it's all very interesting and always very controversial.

241
00:14:02,157 --> 00:14:08,298
[SPEAKER_29]: This mostly is from Sega, who we've had some problems with in the past about Fantasy Star Universe.

242
00:14:08,338 --> 00:14:13,039
[SPEAKER_29]: But anyways, let's talk about next-gen, shall we?

243
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:17,280
[SPEAKER_29]: Virtual Fighter V for the PlayStation 3 is slated to come out...

244
00:14:18,038 --> 00:14:20,759
[SPEAKER_29]: March 15th of next year, so look forward to that.

245
00:14:20,999 --> 00:14:29,722
[SPEAKER_29]: Also, you know, Gracie and her presence will be Virtual Tennis 3 for both the PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360, and the PSP.

246
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:33,843
[SPEAKER_29]: All those coming out on the 21st of March next year.

247
00:14:35,384 --> 00:14:39,725
[SPEAKER_29]: This one we ran on the site also, and this is probably the first you'll hear of it.

248
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:44,107
[SPEAKER_29]: Full Auto 2 coming to the PSP March 14th.

249
00:14:45,345 --> 00:14:47,486
[SPEAKER_29]: So it's not just PlayStation 3 anymore.

250
00:14:47,826 --> 00:14:49,186
[SPEAKER_29]: Very interesting on that.

251
00:14:50,467 --> 00:14:57,869
[SPEAKER_29]: And then this one, which is very controversial, since there was some news from FromSoftware that this version might be not coming out.

252
00:14:58,549 --> 00:15:05,732
[SPEAKER_29]: Coming from Sega, Armored Core 4 on both the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360, March 21st.

253
00:15:06,212 --> 00:15:12,334
[SPEAKER_29]: These dates were just updated in our system on the 11th of September, so this is very fresh news.

254
00:15:13,552 --> 00:15:17,454
[SPEAKER_29]: Also, Afterburner for the PSP coming out March 21st as well.

255
00:15:17,574 --> 00:15:22,497
[SPEAKER_29]: So, look for those wonderful Sega games March of next year.

256
00:15:23,617 --> 00:15:26,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'm going to open up the Skype line over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

257
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:30,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Click on Interact With Us or you can always call us on the regular telephone as well.

258
00:15:30,141 --> 00:15:30,301
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 916-226-9067.

259
00:15:33,007 --> 00:15:35,629
[SPEAKER_03]: I imagine the sky plane is going to be very popular tonight.

260
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:37,090
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get through as many calls as we can.

261
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,912
[SPEAKER_03]: We're practically dedicating a whole segment to it.

262
00:15:38,952 --> 00:15:39,332
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

263
00:15:40,253 --> 00:15:43,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're already coming in, so let's pick up a call and start going.

264
00:15:43,395 --> 00:15:44,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

265
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:44,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

266
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:46,137
[SPEAKER_20]: This is Megzi.

267
00:15:46,157 --> 00:15:47,798
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, Megzi.

268
00:15:47,978 --> 00:15:48,939
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you, Megzi?

269
00:15:49,299 --> 00:15:50,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, I just went deaf.

270
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,161
[SPEAKER_20]: I am fantastic.

271
00:15:51,281 --> 00:15:53,703
[SPEAKER_03]: From all the girly screaming in here, I think I just went deaf.

272
00:15:54,463 --> 00:15:55,004
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind?

273
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:56,525
[SPEAKER_03]: We.

274
00:15:57,386 --> 00:15:58,046
[SPEAKER_03]: We.

275
00:15:58,567 --> 00:16:01,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you excited about the We News, or are you just celebrating our 200th episode with us?

276
00:16:02,691 --> 00:16:03,171
[SPEAKER_20]: A little bit of both.

277
00:16:03,511 --> 00:16:04,012
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

278
00:16:04,112 --> 00:16:05,252
[SPEAKER_03]: You definitely going to be getting a Wii?

279
00:16:06,093 --> 00:16:06,673
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, man.

280
00:16:07,554 --> 00:16:14,858
[SPEAKER_20]: The morning after I knew, I had called my GameStop at 9 in the morning to see if we could do reserves yet, and unfortunately we couldn't.

281
00:16:14,898 --> 00:16:16,359
[SPEAKER_20]: But yes, I will be getting a Wii.

282
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:17,719
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

283
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,500
[SPEAKER_03]: What games do you want to pick up?

284
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,462
[SPEAKER_20]: I would like to stress that I predicted the date.

285
00:16:24,088 --> 00:16:25,190
[SPEAKER_03]: How did you predict the date?

286
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you just pull it out of your butt?

287
00:16:37,316 --> 00:16:38,557
[SPEAKER_20]: that holiday season.

288
00:16:39,418 --> 00:16:49,727
[SPEAKER_20]: And the PS3 launches on a Friday, the 17th is a Friday, and I know Nintendo likes to launch their systems on Sundays, so I said, hey, Sunday the 19th, that could be their release date.

289
00:16:49,747 --> 00:16:50,468
[SPEAKER_20]: That's my prediction.

290
00:16:51,148 --> 00:16:56,493
[SPEAKER_20]: And then not three hours later, the information got leaked that it was going to be released on that Sunday.

291
00:16:57,234 --> 00:17:03,679
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sitting here looking at a text message on my phone that says, November 19th, from Megzi.

292
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:04,420
Ha ha ha!

293
00:17:05,216 --> 00:17:07,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, good job on that, making an educated guess to do it.

294
00:17:07,858 --> 00:17:11,141
[SPEAKER_03]: So, your internet penis grew by two inches for that.

295
00:17:11,181 --> 00:17:13,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.

296
00:17:13,843 --> 00:17:15,024
[SPEAKER_20]: I've also got a funny story.

297
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:15,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

298
00:17:15,544 --> 00:17:16,525
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, the funny story.

299
00:17:17,085 --> 00:17:21,709
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so, lately I've been trying to catch up on games that I might have missed.

300
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:25,051
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, like they came out and they were great, but for some reason I didn't pick them up.

301
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:28,234
[SPEAKER_20]: So, the other day I picked up Metroid Prime, right?

302
00:17:28,774 --> 00:17:31,496
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I never got a chance to play it and I wanted to try it out.

303
00:17:32,137 --> 00:17:32,357
[SPEAKER_20]: So...

304
00:17:33,078 --> 00:17:38,100
[SPEAKER_20]: After I got off work, I called Chris, and... Chris is looking angry at this story already.

305
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,001
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, she's just like... Alright, let's hear it.

306
00:17:41,021 --> 00:17:49,223
[SPEAKER_20]: So, I called up Chris, and I was like, so this is what I did during my day, and I picked up Metroid Prime, and she says, oh, is that the one with the monkey?

307
00:17:53,284 --> 00:17:54,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, poor Chris.

308
00:17:56,585 --> 00:17:58,026
[SPEAKER_03]: We love you, Chris.

309
00:17:58,186 --> 00:18:01,487
[SPEAKER_20]: And so, we decided we're going to make a game called Metroid Primate.

310
00:18:03,178 --> 00:18:04,298
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought it was a different game.

311
00:18:04,378 --> 00:18:06,439
[SPEAKER_19]: I did not claim to be an expert on video games.

312
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,060
[SPEAKER_20]: I know, but Metroid and a monkey.

313
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,701
[SPEAKER_20]: What was your... I'm going to prove to you.

314
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:12,862
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought it was a different game.

315
00:18:12,882 --> 00:18:15,062
[SPEAKER_20]: That's why you thought it was like Dungeon Siege or something.

316
00:18:15,202 --> 00:18:15,963
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I didn't.

317
00:18:16,203 --> 00:18:17,103
[SPEAKER_20]: I thought it was an RP.

318
00:18:17,123 --> 00:18:18,403
[SPEAKER_21]: Megzie, it's Dungeon Zoo.

319
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:19,084
[SPEAKER_21]: Shut up.

320
00:18:19,384 --> 00:18:21,345
[SPEAKER_21]: Dungeon Zoo.

321
00:18:21,405 --> 00:18:26,506
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm still going... Megzie, we need to start doing pictures of Metroid primates.

322
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:27,627
[SPEAKER_20]: Hells yeah.

323
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:28,287
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

324
00:18:30,004 --> 00:18:31,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Heart, we love you, Chris.

325
00:18:31,105 --> 00:18:32,266
[SPEAKER_21]: You hear this?

326
00:18:32,346 --> 00:18:33,426
[SPEAKER_21]: She's invited the biteage.

327
00:18:33,786 --> 00:18:38,789
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to point out, though, WonderDogHerald in our chatroom says, Samus with a pet monkey would be the best.

328
00:18:40,189 --> 00:18:43,351
[SPEAKER_14]: I bet she'd... She had a pet monkey.

329
00:18:43,391 --> 00:18:44,191
[SPEAKER_14]: We love you, Chris.

330
00:18:44,211 --> 00:18:49,974
[SPEAKER_29]: Speaking of pets, you heard this week that they announced Seaman 2 for the PlayStation 2 coming out.

331
00:18:50,054 --> 00:18:50,754
[SPEAKER_29]: Tee hee.

332
00:18:51,135 --> 00:18:51,375
[SPEAKER_29]: What?

333
00:18:51,395 --> 00:18:51,675
[SPEAKER_29]: Tee hee.

334
00:18:53,756 --> 00:18:54,076
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

335
00:18:54,356 --> 00:18:57,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Macy, we've got to take some more calls because everybody's trying to get in tonight, but any last words?

336
00:19:01,644 --> 00:19:02,885
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, Reggie, you're so fine.

337
00:19:02,905 --> 00:19:03,385
[SPEAKER_20]: You're so fine.

338
00:19:03,405 --> 00:19:04,025
[SPEAKER_20]: You blow my mind.

339
00:19:04,045 --> 00:19:04,506
[SPEAKER_20]: Hey, Reggie.

340
00:19:04,866 --> 00:19:05,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey.

341
00:19:05,506 --> 00:19:06,026
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

342
00:19:06,326 --> 00:19:08,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-oh, your girlfriend's getting upset that you're a Reggie fan.

343
00:19:08,907 --> 00:19:09,548
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry.

344
00:19:10,368 --> 00:19:10,648
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

345
00:19:11,709 --> 00:19:12,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Aw, Chris is pouting.

346
00:19:12,589 --> 00:19:13,570
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to say anything to Macy, Chris?

347
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,031
[SPEAKER_19]: I love you, but I hate you.

348
00:19:16,051 --> 00:19:16,891
[SPEAKER_19]: I love you, too.

349
00:19:16,911 --> 00:19:18,732
[SPEAKER_19]: I hate you so much.

350
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:20,893
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, Chris.

351
00:19:21,213 --> 00:19:23,634
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what that... Macy, Macy, you know what that means, though?

352
00:19:23,834 --> 00:19:24,474
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what that means, though?

353
00:19:24,834 --> 00:19:25,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Makeup sex.

354
00:19:26,535 --> 00:19:27,316
[SPEAKER_20]: Ooh.

355
00:19:27,456 --> 00:19:27,756
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

356
00:19:27,816 --> 00:19:28,236
[SPEAKER_03]: See you later.

357
00:19:31,161 --> 00:19:33,363
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you were making a trip to Wisconsin pretty soon, Chris.

358
00:19:33,383 --> 00:19:34,543
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I'm going next weekend.

359
00:19:34,584 --> 00:19:36,044
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's going to be lots of makeup sex.

360
00:19:36,345 --> 00:19:37,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots and lots of makeup sex.

361
00:19:37,665 --> 00:19:39,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange... Whoa, we're getting feedback.

362
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:40,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

363
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:40,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

364
00:19:41,588 --> 00:19:42,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, hello?

365
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:42,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

366
00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:46,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this is, uh, Bob Coffey from the chat room.

367
00:19:46,951 --> 00:19:47,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Bob Coffey, what's on your mind?

368
00:19:47,972 --> 00:19:53,115
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting a lot of feedback, some type of hum, humming hum hum from you, so ask your question and we'll answer it.

369
00:19:53,195 --> 00:19:58,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, um, just like to congratulate you guys on the 200th episode, and, um,

370
00:19:59,289 --> 00:20:04,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting thing about the Wii is... What's that?

371
00:20:05,252 --> 00:20:07,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Um... Hello?

372
00:20:07,593 --> 00:20:08,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, we're here.

373
00:20:08,714 --> 00:20:10,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Get your thought out, please.

374
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:21,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, interesting thing about the Wii, though, is... The one... The fact, um... N64 launched at, um... Originally $249.

375
00:20:22,381 --> 00:20:24,442
[SPEAKER_05]: But right before they launched, they cut it to $199, so...

376
00:20:27,898 --> 00:20:29,699
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, very interesting thought.

377
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:38,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Good chance Nintendo might just cut the price right at the last minute, kind of as a, you know, kicking it to the sand to Sony.

378
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,205
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be an interesting technique.

379
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:41,166
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

380
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:44,988
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's basically a comment I'd like to make, and...

381
00:20:46,587 --> 00:20:48,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry about the shitty first call.

382
00:20:48,329 --> 00:20:48,869
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all right.

383
00:20:48,909 --> 00:20:49,169
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.

384
00:20:49,189 --> 00:20:51,131
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a bad hum, so that's all right.

385
00:20:51,151 --> 00:20:53,433
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be able to hear it and try to figure out what the problem is.

386
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:54,534
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to let you go, though, buddy.

387
00:20:54,814 --> 00:20:55,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks so much for the call.

388
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:56,756
[SPEAKER_03]: We like hearing from new people.

389
00:20:57,116 --> 00:21:02,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting thought that Nintendo 64 was going to be $249 when it first came out, and then they cut the price at the last minute.

390
00:21:02,581 --> 00:21:03,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Could that happen again?

391
00:21:03,802 --> 00:21:05,844
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the pack-in game kind of breaks the steel here.

392
00:21:05,884 --> 00:21:09,647
[SPEAKER_03]: I think with Wii Sports being in there, I think $250 is kind of set in stone.

393
00:21:10,188 --> 00:21:12,190
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see it getting cut at the last minute, but who knows?

394
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything's possible, right?

395
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:14,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?

396
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,022
[SPEAKER_29]: I think it all comes down to their feedback that you get from people.

397
00:21:18,523 --> 00:21:19,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's go to another call.

398
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

399
00:21:20,264 --> 00:21:20,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

400
00:21:21,825 --> 00:21:23,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Greetings, my brethren and sister-in.

401
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:26,367
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Mel B, actually.

402
00:21:26,648 --> 00:21:27,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Mel!

403
00:21:27,668 --> 00:21:27,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi!

404
00:21:27,908 --> 00:21:28,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow!

405
00:21:28,969 --> 00:21:30,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Mel, you were here forever ago.

406
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:33,372
[SPEAKER_03]: You've known of Orange Launch Radio since episode, like, six.

407
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much.

408
00:21:36,322 --> 00:21:39,384
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen you in, like, what, maybe three different studios already?

409
00:21:39,484 --> 00:21:41,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we've been to a lot of different places.

410
00:21:41,886 --> 00:21:43,488
[SPEAKER_03]: We've gotten evicted from a lot of places.

411
00:21:44,008 --> 00:21:44,829
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind, buddy?

412
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:50,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well, you know, it's 200, and you know I had to weigh in, you know, say congratulations to you guys.

413
00:21:50,834 --> 00:21:51,634
[SPEAKER_29]: Appreciate it.

414
00:21:52,295 --> 00:22:00,081
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's just, I'm just really proud of how you guys have grown, like, within this 194 episodes, I guess, since I'd first seen you.

415
00:22:00,702 --> 00:22:03,304
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I can remember back in the day when, you know, it was like,

416
00:22:03,752 --> 00:22:16,462
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys would have to be scrapping to get contact left and right and like, you know, I'd be trying to hook you up with this and now you guys are like making a name on your own and it's like, you know, I can just fade in the background and I mean, you guys have just been darn good ever since.

417
00:22:16,823 --> 00:22:20,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we appreciate you, you know, taking a chance on the show when it was such a little deal.

418
00:22:20,525 --> 00:22:23,308
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you were a big name in the DDR scene for freestyle and everything.

419
00:22:23,328 --> 00:22:25,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, still are too, just, you know, DDR in general.

420
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:32,295
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you haven't had a lot of tournaments lately but, you know, you came on our show kind of early on and a lot of people recognize you from freestyle so,

421
00:22:33,048 --> 00:22:33,549
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

422
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,931
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it kind of enabled us to be all friends and stuff after that.

423
00:22:37,071 --> 00:22:40,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was kind of a big thing to have Mr. DDR Idol on there.

424
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:42,715
[SPEAKER_09]: Cutting one of those first radio promos for you back then.

425
00:22:42,735 --> 00:22:43,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was awesome.

426
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:47,518
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do you think of the DDR scene now versus four years ago when the show started?

427
00:22:48,699 --> 00:22:59,766
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, I mean, a lot of it's kind of, I mean, it's been a major shift, whereas before it was sort of like a, kind of like a 60-40 split, whereas like Freestyle was bringing in a lot of casual people in.

428
00:23:00,137 --> 00:23:03,738
[SPEAKER_09]: But now it's become such a technical sport now with Perfect Attack and whatnot.

429
00:23:03,838 --> 00:23:05,578
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty much a standard now.

430
00:23:05,659 --> 00:23:09,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Freestyle is sort of like, I think people just aren't pushing each other nowadays to be better.

431
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,720
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just kind of like waiting for some tournament to come around.

432
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,301
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just doing something good enough to win.

433
00:23:15,381 --> 00:23:18,362
[SPEAKER_09]: So there really just isn't that progress forward quite yet.

434
00:23:18,882 --> 00:23:23,783
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't see one up because Supernova's got so many darn songs that, you know, people were begging for.

435
00:23:23,883 --> 00:23:25,524
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, what can you do?

436
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:25,844
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean...

437
00:23:26,263 --> 00:23:31,825
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure I'm going to break out some more routines sooner or later, but, you know, until then, I guess I'll just be laying in the cut.

438
00:23:32,205 --> 00:23:37,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Is In The Groove partially to blame for Freestyle going down and PA going up?

439
00:23:39,468 --> 00:23:54,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, there just wasn't that much to do in In The Groove for Freestyle, but I think kind of, I think with Freestyle it was just sort of like to the point where I think, I mean, just kind of looking back now, just in retrospect, I think a good Freestyle sort of has a very short

440
00:23:55,850 --> 00:24:07,618
[SPEAKER_09]: LifeSpan, I guess if you could say, it's sort of like you're hot for a good six months or a year, but then afterward, it's like judges, you know, get tired of your act and, you know, they want to see something new, but no one who's really stepped up since like 2003, 2004.

441
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:12,682
[SPEAKER_03]: So, well, I hope Supernova can turn some of that around.

442
00:24:12,702 --> 00:24:13,422
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we'll see, huh?

443
00:24:14,423 --> 00:24:14,843
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm pretty sure.

444
00:24:14,903 --> 00:24:19,767
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I do know some people that are still hungry and waiting for their big chance to, you know, break out on the team that I think...

445
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:27,320
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got to be the onuses on a lot of people who are big into freestyle community that still have name value to put together events.

446
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,122
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't even have to be like a tournament for a thousand bucks or whatever.

447
00:24:30,142 --> 00:24:36,166
[SPEAKER_09]: If you just get good get-togethers, you know, just videotape it and, you know, just get the word around by, you know, whatever.

448
00:24:36,306 --> 00:24:36,706
[SPEAKER_09]: YouTube.

449
00:24:36,786 --> 00:24:38,167
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll get people back into Spain.

450
00:24:38,488 --> 00:24:38,688
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

451
00:24:39,028 --> 00:24:42,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it'll be very interesting to see what happens, you know, in the future and everything.

452
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:45,272
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know OLR wants to do some type of DDR tournament.

453
00:24:45,332 --> 00:24:46,173
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got some ideas.

454
00:24:46,233 --> 00:24:47,594
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see what happens in the future.

455
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,502
[SPEAKER_09]: You can definitely count on me to give you a hand with that one.

456
00:24:50,682 --> 00:24:51,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Appreciate it, buddy.

457
00:24:51,403 --> 00:24:53,205
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to let you go to take more calls, so thanks so much.

458
00:24:53,265 --> 00:24:55,146
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really good to hear from you on this landmark episode.

459
00:24:55,847 --> 00:24:57,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, man.

460
00:24:57,168 --> 00:25:01,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations to all you three, and Madden rules, and screw you guys for hating it.

461
00:25:01,092 --> 00:25:02,233
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't hate Madden.

462
00:25:02,253 --> 00:25:02,773
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't hate it.

463
00:25:02,813 --> 00:25:06,016
[SPEAKER_03]: We just don't, you know, freaking foam at the mouth over it, but, you know.

464
00:25:06,997 --> 00:25:08,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Different strokes for different folks.

465
00:25:09,139 --> 00:25:10,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, but it's all good.

466
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:10,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all take it easy.

467
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,061
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all good.

468
00:25:11,081 --> 00:25:11,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one, buddy.

469
00:25:12,202 --> 00:25:12,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Later.

470
00:25:12,342 --> 00:25:12,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Later.

471
00:25:13,686 --> 00:25:17,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, you mean Roster Update 2006 is the actual name of the game.

472
00:25:17,087 --> 00:25:17,608
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm teasing.

473
00:25:17,648 --> 00:25:18,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to another call.

474

[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to congratulate you on the 200 episodes and everything.

[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we appreciate that a lot, buddy.

[SPEAKER_03]: What?

483
00:25:37,615 --> 00:25:38,776
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind with all the Wii news?

[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just thinking about my bank account, really.

00:25:44,789 --> 00:25:46,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to be getting a PS3, too?

486
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,211
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll be selling a PS3.

00:25:50,251 --> 00:25:53,132

00:26:37,025 --> 00:26:41,409
[SPEAKER_25]: First, congratulations on having 200 episodes.

496
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:42,250
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you very much.

497
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,090
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.

498
00:26:43,791 --> 00:26:49,436
[SPEAKER_25]: I have a few friends with their podcasts and trying to get first live radio and then podcast.

499
00:26:50,437 --> 00:26:52,038
[SPEAKER_25]: It's amazing that you guys have made it this far.

500
00:26:52,098 --> 00:26:54,120
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a big landmark.

501
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,522
[SPEAKER_03]: We're amazed, too, that we've lasted this long.

502
00:26:56,602 --> 00:26:57,643
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something else.

503
00:26:57,743 --> 00:27:04,069
[SPEAKER_03]: I think probably it's crossed all three of our minds at one point or another that we wanted to quit, but there's something that always brings us back.

504
00:27:05,385 --> 00:27:06,385
[SPEAKER_03]: I never do that.

505
00:27:07,466 --> 00:27:09,746
[SPEAKER_03]: I will admit, there was one week where it was pretty bad.

506
00:27:09,786 --> 00:27:12,447
[SPEAKER_03]: I was having a really emo week and I was about ready to come on here and go, I quit!

507
00:27:13,407 --> 00:27:21,348
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, in the end, it's really, you know, it's about you guys and about, you know, of course, Loki and DarkSakura, just getting to hang out with them every week and everything.

508
00:27:21,388 --> 00:27:27,290
[SPEAKER_03]: And while we may have our ups and downs sometimes, you know, it all comes back to games here at Orange Launch Radio, so it's good.

509
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,430
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the great equalizer.

510
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:34,251
[SPEAKER_25]: The second thing was, I saw the Nintendo Wii Plus conference

511
00:27:34,764 --> 00:27:36,644
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, what'd you think?

512
00:27:37,084 --> 00:27:39,225
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, yay that it's coming out so early.

513
00:27:39,765 --> 00:27:41,905
[SPEAKER_25]: I was half thinking it was going to be delayed.

514
00:27:42,806 --> 00:27:44,586
[SPEAKER_25]: But, you know, they actually kept it.

515
00:27:45,466 --> 00:27:53,688
[SPEAKER_25]: And they also were talking about how you can put videos on the memory card and play them back.

516
00:27:55,208 --> 00:28:01,689
[SPEAKER_25]: Now, do you think with codecs and all that, do you think everything's going to work universally or you could just download something?

517
00:28:03,062 --> 00:28:06,244
[SPEAKER_25]: or pay 20 Wii Points and get the newest codec that works with everything?

518
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:07,886
[SPEAKER_25]: Do you have a thought, Loki?

519
00:28:08,546 --> 00:28:14,670
[SPEAKER_29]: It's all up to the, you know, what they're running as far as graphics, you know, a graphics card in there.

520
00:28:14,991 --> 00:28:17,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Would it be licensing with the codecs, too, could come into play?

521
00:28:18,033 --> 00:28:19,414
[SPEAKER_29]: Some codecs are free, but yeah.

522
00:28:19,774 --> 00:28:22,036
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, this is whatever they want to do.

523
00:28:22,116 --> 00:28:27,740
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, I'm sure it's going to support, like, MPEG-2 and stuff like that because, I mean, they were basically kind of thinking...

524
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:33,085
[SPEAKER_29]: Can you take your camcorder and you plug in your SD memory card from that into there and you get to watch videos.

525
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:34,386
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

526
00:28:35,686 --> 00:28:36,046
[SPEAKER_29]: All right.

527
00:28:36,066 --> 00:28:37,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, are you going to be picking up a Wii?

528
00:28:39,027 --> 00:28:39,407
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, yes.

529
00:28:39,847 --> 00:28:40,247
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

530
00:28:40,827 --> 00:28:44,628
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm picking up the PS3 and... You are going to get a PS3.

531
00:28:45,409 --> 00:28:46,129
[SPEAKER_03]: I told you I had to.

532
00:28:46,169 --> 00:28:49,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's right, that's right, because you had to buy the one for your friend because of the bet and everything.

533
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,990
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, you're not going to buy one for yourself?

534
00:28:52,511 --> 00:28:53,771
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, the Wii for myself, yes.

535
00:28:53,831 --> 00:28:54,071
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

536
00:28:54,091 --> 00:28:56,011
[SPEAKER_03]: The PS3, hell no.

537
00:28:56,312 --> 00:28:56,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

538
00:28:56,752 --> 00:28:57,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Why no PS3 for yourself?

539
00:28:58,547 --> 00:29:02,650
[SPEAKER_25]: There's nothing at launch that really drives for me to get it.

540
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:07,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony's going to have to sell it, really, really sell it to Tokyo Game Show to show us why we need one at launch.

541
00:29:07,613 --> 00:29:08,274
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be interesting.

542
00:29:10,755 --> 00:29:11,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

543
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:11,956
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem.

544
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:15,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, we've got to let you go, buddy, because we've got more calls coming in, but thanks so much for calling in tonight.

545
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:16,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

546
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:16,779
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, later.

547
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots and lots of calls tonight.

548
00:29:18,481 --> 00:29:19,181
[SPEAKER_03]: We really appreciate it.

549
00:29:19,902 --> 00:29:20,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to another call.

550
00:29:20,702 --> 00:29:21,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my gosh, we're getting so many calls tonight.

551
00:29:22,623 --> 00:29:23,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

552
00:29:23,764 --> 00:29:24,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

553
00:29:25,385 --> 00:29:26,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Raven Stolfen.

554
00:29:26,386 --> 00:29:27,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Raven Stolfen.

555
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:27,807
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind, buddy?

556
00:29:28,942 --> 00:29:32,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry I'm on my cell phone, but this is Skype's working.

557
00:29:32,283 --> 00:29:34,764
[SPEAKER_03]: That's alright, you know, we're getting hammered left and right tonight.

558
00:29:34,784 --> 00:29:35,284
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind?

559
00:29:37,365 --> 00:29:40,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I got a hairline fracture on my DS.

560
00:29:41,166 --> 00:29:41,946
[SPEAKER_03]: How'd that happen?

561
00:29:43,566 --> 00:29:47,728
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, and I replaced it, and EB charged me 50 bucks for it.

562
00:29:48,128 --> 00:29:48,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Ouch!

563
00:29:48,808 --> 00:29:50,949
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't have one of those replacement policy things or whatever?

564
00:29:51,989 --> 00:29:55,850
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I had it, but they'll trade it in, and you'll get a black one.

565
00:29:56,988 --> 00:29:58,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, huh, interesting.

566
00:29:58,709 --> 00:30:00,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Was this a DS Lite that cracked, or a DS Fat?

567
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:04,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it was a Lite, and I was pissed.

568
00:30:04,331 --> 00:30:06,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, yeah, I got a lot of problems with that.

569
00:30:06,912 --> 00:30:11,174
[SPEAKER_03]: But didn't Nintendo do some type of replacement system, or was that just the UK?

570
00:30:11,274 --> 00:30:12,634
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember, it's been so long now.

571
00:30:13,775 --> 00:30:15,755
[SPEAKER_03]: They charge you 50 bucks to replace it?

572
00:30:17,276 --> 00:30:18,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it your fault?

573
00:30:19,737 --> 00:30:20,537
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it wasn't.

574
00:30:20,557 --> 00:30:22,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing, they replaced it,

575
00:30:23,294 --> 00:30:24,975
[SPEAKER_06]: But it would only be a white one.

576
00:30:25,035 --> 00:30:27,316
[SPEAKER_06]: It wouldn't be a free black one, which pissed me off.

577
00:30:28,056 --> 00:30:28,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I see.

578
00:30:28,636 --> 00:30:31,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, did you have a black one or did you have a white one and you wanted to get a black one?

579
00:30:32,818 --> 00:30:35,199
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a white one and I wanted to get a black one.

580
00:30:35,219 --> 00:30:36,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, well, that's why they charged you for it.

581
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,540
[SPEAKER_03]: God, it's just a stinking color, though.

582
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:42,222
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess, you know, maybe there's more demand for the black ones right now or something.

583
00:30:42,262 --> 00:30:42,582
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

584
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:43,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you want a black one?

585
00:30:43,762 --> 00:30:44,643
[SPEAKER_03]: It wouldn't match your Wii.

586
00:30:46,023 --> 00:30:47,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, everyone wanted a black one.

587
00:30:47,784 --> 00:30:49,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't you say you wanted a pink one?

588
00:30:49,285 --> 00:30:50,085
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a pink one.

589
00:30:51,121 --> 00:30:53,282
[SPEAKER_03]: I almost bought one at Walmart, but I'm poor.

590
00:30:54,442 --> 00:30:56,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we don't make money off OLR.

591
00:30:57,524 --> 00:30:57,984
[SPEAKER_03]: But someday.

592
00:30:59,264 --> 00:30:59,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Someday.

593
00:30:59,925 --> 00:31:02,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Ravenstaff, anything else on your mind, Ravenstaff?

594
00:31:02,306 --> 00:31:03,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we have to get two more calls.

595
00:31:04,767 --> 00:31:05,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sure.

596
00:31:05,487 --> 00:31:06,747
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one more thing on my mind.

597
00:31:06,807 --> 00:31:07,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

598
00:31:10,129 --> 00:31:11,469
[SPEAKER_06]: They're doing the right thing with it.

599
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:13,350
[SPEAKER_03]: How so?

600
00:31:14,929 --> 00:31:20,854
[SPEAKER_06]: because how the name is and how they're setting it up, they're really putting Sony in jeopardy this time.

601
00:31:21,734 --> 00:31:22,215
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

602
00:31:22,355 --> 00:31:25,057
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll all see after the Christmas season when the numbers come out.

603
00:31:25,537 --> 00:31:26,478
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you might be right, though.

604
00:31:27,959 --> 00:31:29,800
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I'm definitely trying to get a Wii.

605
00:31:29,961 --> 00:31:34,484
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to stand in the freezing cold on a Walmart or at EB.

606
00:31:34,624 --> 00:31:35,685
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm paying someone to get it.

607
00:31:36,218 --> 00:31:46,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Just let's hope that whole little thing about what they're supposedly doing in Hawaii with the whole $50 to reserve or $50 in trade-ins to reserve doesn't catch on nationwide because that's kind of poopy.

608
00:31:47,382 --> 00:31:47,822
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see.

609
00:31:48,102 --> 00:31:49,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, all right, guys.

610
00:31:49,223 --> 00:31:52,824
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to cut it short and go because... All right.

611
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:53,925
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all good, buddy.

612
00:31:54,645 --> 00:31:55,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one.

613
00:31:55,525 --> 00:31:55,705
Bye.

614
00:31:55,905 --> 00:31:56,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Later.

615
00:31:57,546 --> 00:31:59,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, we're just getting more and more calls.

616
00:31:59,907 --> 00:32:00,767
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just keep it going.

617
00:32:00,807 --> 00:32:01,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

618
00:32:01,167 --> 00:32:02,968
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a whole other section of the show here tonight.

619
00:32:03,008 --> 00:32:04,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to another call.

620
00:32:04,108 --> 00:32:04,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

621
00:32:04,969 --> 00:32:05,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

622
00:32:06,002 --> 00:32:06,623
[SPEAKER_03]: It's me, Ranma.

623
00:32:06,663 --> 00:32:07,283
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, fellas?

624
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:08,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, how you doing?

625
00:32:08,344 --> 00:32:08,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, wait a minute.

626
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:09,725
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing good.

627
00:32:09,826 --> 00:32:11,567
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not believe the lady sitting behind me is a fella.

628
00:32:12,688 --> 00:32:14,450
[SPEAKER_21]: Ranchan, how could you forget?

629
00:32:15,271 --> 00:32:18,694
[SPEAKER_24]: I splashed you with stupid stuff from China.

630
00:32:18,734 --> 00:32:19,154
[SPEAKER_24]: What can I tell you?

631
00:32:19,174 --> 00:32:19,835
[SPEAKER_24]: I am not cursed.

632
00:32:20,615 --> 00:32:20,876
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

633
00:32:21,296 --> 00:32:22,217
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind, Ranma?

634
00:32:22,757 --> 00:32:23,138
[SPEAKER_24]: Not much.

635
00:32:23,178 --> 00:32:23,758
[SPEAKER_24]: A few things.

636
00:32:23,818 --> 00:32:27,001
[SPEAKER_24]: I finally saw Dance Revolution yesterday, and it wasn't that bad.

637
00:32:27,522 --> 00:32:27,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

638
00:32:27,922 --> 00:32:30,164
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard it was vomit in my mouth.

639
00:32:30,364 --> 00:32:31,105
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's interesting?

640
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:31,165
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

641
00:32:31,661 --> 00:32:35,124
[SPEAKER_03]: The show is not being carried in Sacramento, so we couldn't see it.

642
00:32:35,404 --> 00:32:37,306
[SPEAKER_24]: Wait, it's not on a CBS out there?

643
00:32:37,506 --> 00:32:38,467
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not on a CBS.

644
00:32:38,687 --> 00:32:41,149
[SPEAKER_29]: I looked at the preview guide and there was not anything there.

645
00:32:41,329 --> 00:32:42,870
[SPEAKER_03]: So kudos to KLVR 13.

646
00:32:43,591 --> 00:32:45,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job, guys.

647
00:32:45,993 --> 00:32:47,254
[SPEAKER_03]: No crap on that network.

648
00:32:47,294 --> 00:32:47,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job.

649
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:48,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Does Viacom own them?

650
00:32:49,035 --> 00:32:52,818
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know, but I heard there was no actual DDR stuff on the show.

651
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:53,299
[SPEAKER_03]: There wasn't.

652
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,322
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same font, and that's about it.

653
00:32:56,922 --> 00:33:03,846
[SPEAKER_24]: It's basically Dance Fever with little kids, and it's a contest, and the grand prize is a $25,000 scholarship from Konami.

654
00:33:03,966 --> 00:33:05,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so why was that not shitty?

655
00:33:06,888 --> 00:33:08,509
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know, because I thought it wasn't so bad.

656
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:09,650
[SPEAKER_24]: It broke the mold.

657
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:12,292
[SPEAKER_24]: Everybody was thinking it was going to be DDR this, DDR that, you know?

658
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:16,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you a 12-year-old girl?

659
00:33:16,975 --> 00:33:17,215
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

660
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:17,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

661
00:33:18,075 --> 00:33:19,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think 12-year-old girls will like the show?

662
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,218
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea.

663
00:33:23,577 --> 00:33:25,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Banda in our chatroom says, fuck Dance Fever.

664
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you too.

665
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:27,941
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

666
00:33:28,221 --> 00:33:29,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else on your mind, buddy?

667
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:39,809
[SPEAKER_24]: I wanted to say some other things, but I have here in my hands a 22-ounce ounce of Guinness, and I'm about to open it up, and I'm having a toast here for you guys.

668
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:41,230
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.

669
00:33:41,491 --> 00:33:42,151
[SPEAKER_03]: A toast to you.

670
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,532
[SPEAKER_24]: Here's to you.

671
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:44,373
[SPEAKER_24]: Here's to me.

672
00:33:44,433 --> 00:33:45,714
[SPEAKER_24]: The best of friends we will be.

673
00:33:45,874 --> 00:33:48,736
[SPEAKER_24]: But if we should ever happen to agree, well, fuck you, and here's to me.

674
00:33:48,756 --> 00:33:49,777
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm down on this bitch right now.

675
00:33:51,443 --> 00:33:53,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy that Guinness, motherfucker.

676
00:33:53,084 --> 00:33:53,924
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll see you in October.

677
00:33:54,524 --> 00:33:55,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Got that shit right.

678
00:33:55,464 --> 00:33:55,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Later.

679
00:33:58,986 --> 00:34:00,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to one of our old favorites.

680
00:34:00,286 --> 00:34:01,907
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been making the poor bastard wait all night.

681
00:34:02,327 --> 00:34:03,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

682
00:34:03,467 --> 00:34:03,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

683
00:34:04,848 --> 00:34:06,208
[SPEAKER_26]: One and only Legend of Zaku.

684
00:34:06,608 --> 00:34:08,349
[SPEAKER_26]: What's on your mind, Mr. Zaku?

685
00:34:09,145 --> 00:34:12,086
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, by just, you know, 200 episodes, man.

686
00:34:12,106 --> 00:34:16,107
[SPEAKER_26]: That's a feat right there that you can't accomplish without effort.

687
00:34:16,307 --> 00:34:21,968
[SPEAKER_03]: It wouldn't be a 200th episode without our 200 minutes worth of phone calls caller here, Zaku.

688
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:22,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

689
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:24,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Digital Life's coming up.

690
00:34:24,169 --> 00:34:24,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you excited?

691
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:25,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to go see Final Fantasy XII?

692
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:29,190
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, that and I'm trying to pick out a freestyle routine.

693
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:31,570
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm trying to pick out a song, most importantly.

694
00:34:31,831 --> 00:34:34,791
[SPEAKER_26]: I kind of have a case of freestyler's block at the moment.

695
00:34:34,811 --> 00:34:36,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, are you going to come visit me in October?

696
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:37,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm coming to New York.

697
00:34:37,412 --> 00:34:37,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm

698
00:34:38,357 --> 00:34:38,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet.

699
00:34:38,597 --> 00:34:39,237
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, most likely.

700
00:34:39,398 --> 00:34:39,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.

701
00:34:40,038 --> 00:34:42,859
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll even give you the stuff that I'm a snag from Digital Life.

702
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,480
[SPEAKER_03]: You gonna give us another signed poster?

703
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that was pretty badass.

704
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,741
[SPEAKER_03]: You got us the signed Indie Geek poster.

705
00:34:46,761 --> 00:34:49,842
[SPEAKER_26]: That depends if Rocks or Red Octane has something set up.

706
00:34:50,163 --> 00:34:50,903
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll take anything.

707
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:51,703
[SPEAKER_03]: We like free things.

708
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:53,264
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, alright then.

709
00:34:55,205 --> 00:34:57,786
[SPEAKER_26]: You know Supernova's patch came out last week, right?

710
00:34:57,886 --> 00:34:58,366
[SPEAKER_26]: That's right.

711
00:34:58,406 --> 00:35:00,147
[SPEAKER_26]: We have a patch and there's a new song in it, right?

712
00:35:00,167 --> 00:35:00,828
[SPEAKER_26]: Some type of remix?

713
00:35:01,508 --> 00:35:03,489
[SPEAKER_26]: Fascination Eternal Love Remix.

714
00:35:03,529 --> 00:35:04,129
[SPEAKER_26]: Should be fun.

715
00:35:04,169 --> 00:35:04,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

716
00:35:04,689 --> 00:35:05,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Should be fun.

717
00:35:06,534 --> 00:35:21,346
[SPEAKER_26]: It's basically a remix of Fascination Max, but with the sounds that you get from opening a door in a car, the little ringing sound, and just a lot of phone ringing right there.

718
00:35:22,867 --> 00:35:24,409
[SPEAKER_26]: I think you have the video up there on your site.

719
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:25,950
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

720
00:35:28,352 --> 00:35:34,357
[SPEAKER_26]: Anyways, the last thing, I don't get how Nintendo flip-flops on what they say.

721
00:35:35,228 --> 00:35:41,111
[SPEAKER_26]: On one side, they said that it was going to be region-free, but on the other, they act as if it didn't exist.

722
00:35:41,131 --> 00:35:42,032
[SPEAKER_26]: They end up denying it.

723
00:35:42,292 --> 00:35:44,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone hasn't made a final decision on it.

724
00:35:45,134 --> 00:35:47,315
[SPEAKER_03]: The left hand's not talking to the right hand.

725
00:35:47,335 --> 00:35:49,917
[SPEAKER_26]: That's exactly what's going on.

726
00:35:49,957 --> 00:35:52,298
[SPEAKER_26]: Happens in corporate America all the time.

727
00:35:52,318 --> 00:36:03,024
[SPEAKER_26]: I was pretty excited on Thursday when I heard all these wonderful fairy tales about the Wii, and then all of a sudden, we have this little black eye that came days later.

728
00:36:03,725 --> 00:36:04,325
[SPEAKER_26]: That could have...

729
00:36:05,106 --> 00:36:07,306
[SPEAKER_26]: Was the news the end of the world, though, Zaku?

730
00:36:08,927 --> 00:36:11,307
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, you know what?

731
00:36:11,387 --> 00:36:13,467
[SPEAKER_26]: Screw the Wii and PS3.

732
00:36:13,848 --> 00:36:15,308
[SPEAKER_26]: It's all about Happy Sky CS.

733
00:36:15,428 --> 00:36:15,788
[SPEAKER_26]: That's it.

734
00:36:16,928 --> 00:36:19,789
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm focusing all my energy on something besides the hype.

735
00:36:19,869 --> 00:36:21,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Beatmania is the only game you need, huh?

736
00:36:22,269 --> 00:36:23,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, pretty much.

737
00:36:23,129 --> 00:36:23,449
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

738
00:36:23,569 --> 00:36:23,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds fair.

739
00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:25,109
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to let you go, Zaku.

740
00:36:25,129 --> 00:36:25,690
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got more calls.

741
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,350
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

742
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:26,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Later, buddy.

743
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:27,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace.

744
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:29,010
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

745
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:30,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's one more call.

746
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:30,850
[SPEAKER_03]: He's coming in.

747
00:36:31,391 --> 00:36:32,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on... Oops, did I pick this up?

748
00:36:33,371 --> 00:36:33,771
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I did.

749
00:36:34,369 --> 00:36:35,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

750
00:36:35,729 --> 00:36:36,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

751
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:37,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, it's Arcadian42.

752
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Arcadian42, what's on your mind?

753
00:36:40,811 --> 00:36:47,412
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to call in because I haven't listened in a while and had a connection from the first show since I think I was there.

754
00:36:47,773 --> 00:36:48,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Or at least one of the first shows.

755
00:36:48,933 --> 00:36:54,694
[SPEAKER_03]: You were there on the first show and this is the most we've ever heard from you in like 200 episodes worth of shows.

756
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:56,795
[SPEAKER_08]: You might have heard a little bit more.

757
00:36:57,015 --> 00:36:57,615
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I know.

758
00:36:57,695 --> 00:36:59,656
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate your support over the years, Arcadian42.

759
00:36:59,676 --> 00:36:59,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

760
00:37:01,728 --> 00:37:07,491
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been less recently since I've been playing too many video games What do you think of the Wii?

761
00:37:08,592 --> 00:37:19,839
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like it'll be interesting I haven't really been following the news but since I might have money soon I might actually be able to buy one Awesome Is that the system of choice amongst the three?

762
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:27,403
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know I'll have to see what I want Alright, sounds good Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

763
00:37:28,828 --> 00:37:29,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Not really.

764
00:37:30,108 --> 00:37:31,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Just congratulations on your 200 episodes.

765
00:37:32,529 --> 00:37:34,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I'll see you and come to a future show.

766
00:37:34,829 --> 00:37:35,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, anytime.

767
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:36,930
[SPEAKER_03]: The door's open to you anytime.

768
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:38,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

769
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:39,190
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

770
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:39,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

771
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:43,871
[SPEAKER_03]: It really means a lot to us that we have folks that remember us all the way from episode one still calling in.

772
00:37:43,931 --> 00:37:45,452
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you've been a long time supporter of the show.

773
00:37:45,772 --> 00:37:46,932
[SPEAKER_03]: We really appreciate it, my friend.

774
00:37:47,712 --> 00:37:47,992
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

775
00:37:48,212 --> 00:37:49,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, have a good one, buddy.

776
00:37:49,612 --> 00:37:49,912
[SPEAKER_14]: You too.

777
00:37:50,112 --> 00:37:50,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Later.

778
00:37:51,773 --> 00:37:53,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots and lots of good... Let's do at least one more call here.

779
00:37:53,993 --> 00:37:55,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

780
00:37:55,254 --> 00:37:55,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

781
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:57,454
[SPEAKER_07]: AJ Twist.

782
00:37:57,887 --> 00:37:58,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, what's on your mind?

783
00:38:00,168 --> 00:38:02,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Just calling in to say happy 200th birthday.

784
00:38:03,088 --> 00:38:03,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

785
00:38:03,408 --> 00:38:07,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, practically it.

786
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:08,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Seeing how you guys are.

787
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:12,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, I wanted to talk to DarkSakura about Tekken VR.

788
00:38:12,491 --> 00:38:12,771
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

789
00:38:14,891 --> 00:38:15,572
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura?

790
00:38:16,272 --> 00:38:16,892
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes?

791
00:38:17,932 --> 00:38:19,333
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you liking the game?

792
00:38:20,833 --> 00:38:24,894
[SPEAKER_21]: I have to say that I like it a whole lot because I'm just such an uber Tekken fangirl that

793
00:38:25,914 --> 00:38:28,815
[SPEAKER_21]: It's all about... Though I always play with Jin every time.

794
00:38:29,435 --> 00:38:30,216
[SPEAKER_21]: But it's really fun.

795
00:38:30,236 --> 00:38:32,257
[SPEAKER_21]: I like that you have so many different characters to choose from.

796
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:33,657
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty cool.

797
00:38:33,677 --> 00:38:40,160
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you remember my letter I wrote in two, three, four months ago, maybe.

798
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,300
[SPEAKER_07]: I wrote to Pink Yoshi.

799
00:38:44,201 --> 00:38:48,423
[SPEAKER_03]: I think... I seem to recall a handle named Pink Yoshi because I'm sure I would have made fun of it.

800
00:38:49,443 --> 00:38:50,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, you did.

801
00:38:50,284 --> 00:38:51,024
[SPEAKER_07]: I see.

802
00:38:52,805 --> 00:38:53,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing personal, my friend.

803
00:38:54,794 --> 00:38:55,495
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's all good.

804
00:38:56,315 --> 00:39:01,499
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I'm still up for some good matches with you, DarkSakura, Tekken.

805
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Someday, sometime.

806
00:39:04,421 --> 00:39:04,881
[SPEAKER_21]: Sometime.

807
00:39:04,962 --> 00:39:09,905
[SPEAKER_21]: Right now it's been kind of crazy busy, but I'm working on trying to set some time aside.

808
00:39:10,025 --> 00:39:16,870
[SPEAKER_21]: If I can ever wrestle the PSP away from Dan, except he's been... I'll have to take it when he's distracted with pinball.

809
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:20,152
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys will have to set up some time on the Orange Ones Radio message forums.

810
00:39:20,793 --> 00:39:23,595
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, send me a message on the forums and we'll see about setting something up.

811
00:39:24,502 --> 00:39:25,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you aware of the ghost system?

812
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:26,644
[SPEAKER_21]: Huh?

813
00:39:27,304 --> 00:39:27,585
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry?

814
00:39:27,605 --> 00:39:28,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you aware of the ghost system?

815
00:39:29,646 --> 00:39:30,267
[SPEAKER_21]: No, actually.

816
00:39:31,468 --> 00:39:41,336
[SPEAKER_07]: If you play through the dojo, eventually you can unlock the ghost system which records your character as you play and act as your ghost and you can play that.

817
00:39:41,896 --> 00:39:43,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Other players can play that online.

818
00:39:43,698 --> 00:39:44,358
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, that's pretty cool.

819
00:39:44,398 --> 00:39:44,959
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of neat.

820
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,661
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll have to do that then.

821
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:54,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Once you get that ghost, maybe you can somehow rip it out of the ESP and online send it over to me and I'll send you my ghost.

822
00:39:56,075 --> 00:39:56,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, that's kind of neat.

823
00:39:56,836 --> 00:39:57,916
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish they did that for Mario Kart.

824
00:39:57,936 --> 00:39:59,618
[SPEAKER_21]: I have to set some time aside.

825
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:02,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Check out Tekken, if I may plug in the site.

826
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that all right?

827
00:40:05,723 --> 00:40:06,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I missed that.

828
00:40:06,283 --> 00:40:06,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Tekken what?

829
00:40:07,824 --> 00:40:08,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Tekken Zaibatsu.

830
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:10,306
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, Tekken Zaibatsu?

831
00:40:11,227 --> 00:40:13,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they have a little form on that, too.

832
00:40:14,089 --> 00:40:19,773
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, yeah, I used to go to that site all the time to get all the pictures and everything from the official Namco art.

833
00:40:20,914 --> 00:40:21,555
[SPEAKER_21]: I haven't been to that.

834
00:40:21,575 --> 00:40:23,556
[SPEAKER_21]: I actually haven't been to that site in easily a year.

835
00:40:23,596 --> 00:40:24,277
[SPEAKER_21]: I forgot about it.

836
00:40:25,709 --> 00:40:27,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it hasn't been too big lately.

837
00:40:27,891 --> 00:40:29,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Not much going on.

838
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:30,192
[SPEAKER_21]: No, that's a cool site.

839
00:40:30,212 --> 00:40:30,973
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll have to check out the forum.

840
00:40:31,233 --> 00:40:31,493
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks.

841
00:40:32,494 --> 00:40:33,054
[SPEAKER_07]: No problem.

842
00:40:33,234 --> 00:40:34,095
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, any other thoughts?

843
00:40:34,475 --> 00:40:35,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, oh, Loki?

844
00:40:36,836 --> 00:40:37,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?

845
00:40:37,877 --> 00:40:41,620
[SPEAKER_07]: A question about the PSP on hacking it, since you're big on that.

846
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:42,880
[SPEAKER_03]: What now?

847
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:44,641
[SPEAKER_03]: A question on the PSP hacking.

848
00:40:44,761 --> 00:40:44,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

849
00:40:46,322 --> 00:40:50,005
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know any cool type of media players that can play playlists?

850
00:40:50,945 --> 00:40:51,446
[SPEAKER_29]: Hmm.

851
00:40:52,671 --> 00:40:54,352
[SPEAKER_29]: I can play playlists.

852
00:40:54,392 --> 00:40:59,875
[SPEAKER_29]: I know they had some stuff where you can stream like playlists from your PC.

853
00:41:00,735 --> 00:41:02,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know that one too.

854
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:03,597
[SPEAKER_29]: What's the website you always use?

855
00:41:03,617 --> 00:41:04,697
[SPEAKER_29]: PSP Updates or something?

856
00:41:04,717 --> 00:41:06,018
[SPEAKER_29]: PSP Updates has a lot of stuff on there.

857
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:06,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Check it out.

858
00:41:06,678 --> 00:41:08,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'll go check around there more.

859
00:41:08,419 --> 00:41:09,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

860
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:09,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks anyways.

861
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we gotta let you go, my friend.

862
00:41:12,321 --> 00:41:14,442
[SPEAKER_03]: We got some more calls to get through and then we're gonna end the show.

863
00:41:15,383 --> 00:41:18,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, happy 200th episode again and have a good night.

864
00:41:18,664 --> 00:41:18,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

865
00:41:19,265 --> 00:41:19,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one, buddy.

866
00:41:21,426 --> 00:41:21,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye-bye.

867
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,891
[SPEAKER_03]: This number has been trying to hammer us for a little bit now.

868
00:41:25,491 --> 00:41:27,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

869
00:41:27,072 --> 00:41:27,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

870
00:41:28,313 --> 00:41:28,833
[SPEAKER_03]: I made it.

871
00:41:29,214 --> 00:41:29,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

872
00:41:29,514 --> 00:41:29,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa.

873
00:41:29,834 --> 00:41:30,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

874
00:41:30,114 --> 00:41:30,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

875
00:41:31,495 --> 00:41:32,055
[SPEAKER_03]: It's DT.

876
00:41:32,856 --> 00:41:33,436
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, DT.

877
00:41:33,476 --> 00:41:34,237
[SPEAKER_11]: What's on your mind?

878
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:39,240
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been trying to call in ever since the segment opened.

879
00:41:39,621 --> 00:41:39,881
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

880
00:41:39,901 --> 00:41:41,061
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been hammered tonight.

881
00:41:41,122 --> 00:41:41,862
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.

882
00:41:41,902 --> 00:41:42,823
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind, my friend?

883
00:41:45,104 --> 00:41:47,206
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to wish you guys a happy 200th.

884
00:41:47,866 --> 00:41:48,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Appreciate it.

885
00:41:48,647 --> 00:41:50,688
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been with us since episode one, right?

886
00:41:51,318 --> 00:41:52,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, absolutely.

887
00:41:54,139 --> 00:41:56,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what do you think about the Wii news?

888
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:57,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to be picking up a Wii?

889
00:41:58,821 --> 00:42:00,442
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll probably get one for Christmas.

890
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:03,163
[SPEAKER_21]: What games in particular are you looking forward to?

891
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:09,646
[SPEAKER_11]: Red Steel looks kind of cool.

892
00:42:10,666 --> 00:42:11,427
[SPEAKER_27]: Not Smash Bros.

893
00:42:11,447 --> 00:42:11,767
[SPEAKER_27]: Brawl?

894
00:42:12,367 --> 00:42:13,568
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh yeah.

895
00:42:14,208 --> 00:42:15,208
[SPEAKER_27]: You're pumped up for that, right?

896
00:42:16,269 --> 00:42:16,629
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh yeah.

897
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:23,764
[SPEAKER_21]: So actually speaking of Unsmashed Brothers of Ballroom, are there any other characters that you wanted to see in it, either Konami or Nintendo?

898
00:42:25,806 --> 00:42:29,509
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I was kind of hoping Lolo and Lala would be in it.

899
00:42:30,029 --> 00:42:30,609
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, wow.

900
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:32,751
[SPEAKER_27]: They're HAL characters?

901
00:42:32,771 --> 00:42:33,471
[SPEAKER_21]: Lolo and Lala.

902
00:42:33,732 --> 00:42:35,393
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh my god, that is old school.

903
00:42:36,634 --> 00:42:39,356
[SPEAKER_21]: What would they do, turn duels over?

904
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:42,057
[SPEAKER_27]: They would turn your character into eggs and then push boxes at you.

905
00:42:42,678 --> 00:42:43,298
[SPEAKER_27]: There you go.

906
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:44,699
[SPEAKER_27]: Way old school.

907
00:42:46,806 --> 00:42:47,487
[SPEAKER_14]: That's pretty cool.

908
00:42:47,987 --> 00:42:50,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, DT, I know you've been supporting us since episode one.

909
00:42:50,549 --> 00:42:52,050
[SPEAKER_03]: We really, really appreciate it.

910
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:56,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Your enthusiasm for this station has been wonderful, and I know you work for our site now, and we love having you on board.

911
00:42:56,894 --> 00:42:57,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks so much for calling in.

912
00:42:58,135 --> 00:42:58,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Anytime.

913
00:42:58,876 --> 00:42:59,756
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, have a good one, my friend.

914
00:43:00,757 --> 00:43:01,157
[SPEAKER_03]: You too.

915
00:43:01,317 --> 00:43:01,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye-bye.

916
00:43:01,758 --> 00:43:03,119
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have to play DDR together someday.

917
00:43:03,319 --> 00:43:04,820
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen him in a while.

918
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:05,461
[SPEAKER_03]: He's local.

919
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:06,602
[SPEAKER_03]: We, like, never see each other.

920
00:43:06,802 --> 00:43:07,522
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.

921
00:43:08,703 --> 00:43:11,846
[SPEAKER_03]: DT, DarkSakura, he, like, lives just around the corner, practically.

922
00:43:11,866 --> 00:43:12,406
[SPEAKER_03]: We never see him.

923
00:43:12,666 --> 00:43:13,247
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of sad.

924
00:43:14,608 --> 00:43:15,008
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

925
00:43:15,028 --> 00:43:15,869
[SPEAKER_21]: I see him at Dan's store.

926
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:19,132
[SPEAKER_21]: I randomly run into him at Dan's GameStop.

927
00:43:19,332 --> 00:43:20,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you guys so much for calling.

928
00:43:20,974 --> 00:43:21,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we got one more.

929
00:43:21,815 --> 00:43:22,435
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll make this real quick.

930
00:43:23,076 --> 00:43:23,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

931
00:43:23,896 --> 00:43:24,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

932
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:27,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.

933
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:28,801
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind, Actdeft?

934
00:43:29,741 --> 00:43:30,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotta be quick.

935
00:43:30,362 --> 00:43:30,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh!

936
00:43:30,582 --> 00:43:31,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

937
00:43:31,042 --> 00:43:32,844
[SPEAKER_23]: What's on your mind?

938
00:43:32,864 --> 00:43:33,104
[SPEAKER_23]: I agree.

939
00:43:33,124 --> 00:43:34,706
[SPEAKER_23]: The Wii is gonna be awesome.

940
00:43:45,037 --> 00:43:46,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you so much for calling in.

941
00:43:46,598 --> 00:43:48,600
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to keep it short, though, because we've got to get to our next segment.

942
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,521
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome to hear from people outside of the U.S.

943
00:43:50,601 --> 00:43:51,002
[SPEAKER_03]: once in a while.

944
00:43:51,022 --> 00:43:53,043
[SPEAKER_03]: We love hearing from Canada, Mexico, U.K.

945
00:43:53,083 --> 00:43:53,444
[SPEAKER_03]: We love it.

946
00:43:56,026 --> 00:43:56,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Is he still there?

947
00:43:56,686 --> 00:43:56,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello?

948
00:43:58,167 --> 00:43:58,928
[SPEAKER_03]: There must be a delay.

949
00:43:59,668 --> 00:44:00,269
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he hung up.

950
00:44:00,589 --> 00:44:00,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well.

951
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:01,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well.

952
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:02,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you.

953
00:44:02,651 --> 00:44:03,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for calling.

954
00:44:03,491 --> 00:44:03,752
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

955
00:44:03,812 --> 00:44:06,073
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the first call from Mexico we've gotten.

956
00:44:06,474 --> 00:44:06,854
[SPEAKER_21]: I think so.

957
00:44:06,994 --> 00:44:07,535
[SPEAKER_03]: How sweet.

958
00:44:08,075 --> 00:44:08,335
[SPEAKER_21]: Cool.

959
00:44:08,355 --> 00:44:08,836
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

960
00:44:08,856 --> 00:44:08,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

961
00:44:09,756 --> 00:44:10,817
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go to Cabo someday.

962
00:44:10,897 --> 00:44:12,338
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never been to Mexico, but I want to go to Cabo.

963
00:44:12,478 --> 00:44:13,559
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to go to Tijuana.

964
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:14,420
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

965
00:44:15,773 --> 00:44:16,753
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do this now.

966
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:18,575
[SPEAKER_03]: I warned you this would be a little bit random.

967
00:44:19,295 --> 00:44:31,804
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to bring back a segment that you guys who listen to the old show know and those of you guys who joined us in the podcast maybe have never heard this segment before but it's been known to get a little bit weird and a little bit random and a little bit questiony.

968
00:44:32,304 --> 00:44:34,966
[SPEAKER_03]: It's this old segment called Ask Orange Lounge.

969
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:42,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's Ask Orange Lounge.

970
00:44:42,939 --> 00:44:44,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Some stupid question.

971
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

972
00:44:48,243 --> 00:44:55,248
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure it's going to be interesting because we haven't allowed this segment on in over a year because the questions have been lame.

973
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:01,592
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's see what you guys have pent up over the past year.

974
00:45:03,874 --> 00:45:06,375
[SPEAKER_03]: DMN wants to know, oh, I'm sorry, let's see.

975
00:45:06,796 --> 00:45:10,318
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the most fun thing and the most frustrating thing about doing Orange Lounge Radio?

976
00:45:11,701 --> 00:45:16,202
[SPEAKER_21]: The most fun thing is having my ego grow.

977
00:45:17,362 --> 00:45:19,903
[SPEAKER_21]: And the most frustrating thing is this room.

978
00:45:21,003 --> 00:45:21,823
[SPEAKER_21]: With the door shut.

979
00:45:22,824 --> 00:45:26,744
[SPEAKER_29]: It does get quite hot in here.

980
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:28,765
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know.

981
00:45:31,165 --> 00:45:32,946
[SPEAKER_29]: Just trying to stay on top of the news.

982
00:45:33,306 --> 00:45:34,826
[SPEAKER_29]: It's kind of tough during the week.

983
00:45:35,146 --> 00:45:38,247
[SPEAKER_29]: Remembering to update my show rules.

984
00:45:39,399 --> 00:45:42,822
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say the most fun thing about Orange Launch Radio... Oh, it's so much fun.

985
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:51,028
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's getting that instant feedback of having people, whether it be DarkSakura or Loki, right here in my ear, or having the chat room there.

986
00:45:51,128 --> 00:45:54,790
[SPEAKER_03]: I think having that feedback on your opinions is really great and kind of neat.

987
00:45:55,091 --> 00:45:58,353
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it's just the reward I get from it is instant gratification.

988
00:45:58,393 --> 00:45:59,974
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm a typical male.

989
00:46:00,615 --> 00:46:03,637
[SPEAKER_03]: The most frustrating thing about doing Orange Launch Radio is losing my Sunday nights.

990
00:46:04,609 --> 00:46:08,611
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, as much as I enjoy hanging out, but it's tough because it means you only really get a one-day weekend.

991
00:46:08,951 --> 00:46:10,292
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so that's been frustrating.

992
00:46:10,352 --> 00:46:13,214
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I don't know, I guess you're just used to it after 200 weeks now, right?

993
00:46:14,074 --> 00:46:14,834
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I feel.

994
00:46:15,055 --> 00:46:15,335
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

995
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:16,135
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just kind of used to it.

996
00:46:16,955 --> 00:46:23,299
[SPEAKER_21]: I have fully timed it, you know, how long I have to leave the South Bay now to get here.

997
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:29,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys, since we have about at least 20 people who have submitted questions tonight, we can't get all your questions in, so we apologize.

998
00:46:29,622 --> 00:46:32,864
[SPEAKER_03]: The things that are a little too random and weird, we may not be able to get to tonight.

999
00:46:32,904 --> 00:46:33,484
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize.

1000
00:46:34,808 --> 00:46:38,670
[SPEAKER_03]: OL Army Eddie wants to know, where can I get all these cool songs you play?

1001
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:39,851
[SPEAKER_03]: The internet.

1002
00:46:40,991 --> 00:46:42,792
[SPEAKER_21]: The internet is not just for porn.

1003
00:46:42,812 --> 00:46:43,232
[SPEAKER_03]: iTunes.

1004
00:46:44,973 --> 00:46:47,154
[SPEAKER_03]: If you ever want to know, try asking in chat.

1005
00:46:47,434 --> 00:46:48,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Try emailing one of us.

1006
00:46:49,615 --> 00:46:56,379
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing is that when you guys ask during the show, sometimes we're so busy operating the behind-the-scenes stuff that we can't answer questions right away.

1007
00:46:56,779 --> 00:46:58,700
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you can come a few bars, we'll tell you.

1008
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:00,361
[SPEAKER_03]: You can always send us an email.

1009
00:47:00,721 --> 00:47:02,341
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm more than fine with sharing song titles and things.

1010
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:02,862
[SPEAKER_13]: You can send me an email.

1011
00:47:03,222 --> 00:47:03,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1012
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,603
[SPEAKER_03]: R Also, he wants to know, I guess I'll go ahead and entertain this question.

1013
00:47:09,943 --> 00:47:11,644
[SPEAKER_03]: What would cause Sky to go straight?

1014
00:47:11,824 --> 00:47:12,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Be graphic if needed.

1015
00:47:14,145 --> 00:47:14,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing my tits.

1016
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:15,987
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that, Chris?

1017
00:47:16,747 --> 00:47:17,588
[SPEAKER_19]: Seeing my tits.

1018
00:47:18,228 --> 00:47:19,189
[SPEAKER_03]: That might be a good start.

1019
00:47:19,929 --> 00:47:25,953
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say one hot night with Gina Grishan or Beyonce.

1020
00:47:25,993 --> 00:47:27,234
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why I love Beyonce.

1021
00:47:27,254 --> 00:47:27,954
[SPEAKER_03]: She's so hot.

1022
00:47:28,174 --> 00:47:28,775
[SPEAKER_03]: She's really hot.

1023
00:47:30,035 --> 00:47:30,616
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't know.

1024
00:47:31,076 --> 00:47:32,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I'd

1025
00:47:33,018 --> 00:47:35,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Boobs and Punaner just don't do it for me.

1026
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:36,359
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1027
00:47:36,379 --> 00:47:41,080
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sure you appreciate the aesthetic value of boobs.

1028
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I ask the women out there, do boobs and Punaner do it for you?

1029
00:47:45,041 --> 00:47:51,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I know this is probably not the best room to ask this question, but I'm asking the other women out there.

1030
00:47:51,303 --> 00:47:52,263
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I feel.

1031
00:47:52,644 --> 00:47:57,505
[SPEAKER_03]: And guys out there, if you're a straight man, does penis do it for you?

1032
00:47:58,462 --> 00:47:59,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you like the cock?

1033
00:47:59,902 --> 00:48:02,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's how I feel about boobs and punaner.

1034
00:48:02,543 --> 00:48:03,263
[SPEAKER_21]: Are you gay?

1035
00:48:03,703 --> 00:48:05,283
[SPEAKER_21]: If you scream phone call, you gay.

1036
00:48:07,344 --> 00:48:09,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft wants to know, can you speak Spanish?

1037
00:48:11,605 --> 00:48:14,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Uno pequeño de español, si.

1038
00:48:15,005 --> 00:48:16,166
[SPEAKER_19]: Unos zapatos aquí.

1039
00:48:17,346 --> 00:48:23,387
[SPEAKER_03]: I had two years of Spanish, or dos años de español en colegio, but I'm not very good at it.

1040
00:48:23,427 --> 00:48:24,887
[SPEAKER_03]: I only remember a few words here and there.

1041
00:48:25,167 --> 00:48:26,648
[SPEAKER_21]: El teléfono es en fuego.

1042
00:48:29,593 --> 00:48:35,918
[SPEAKER_21]: I took French and Japanese, so I can also say the TV is on fire.

1043
00:48:36,598 --> 00:48:39,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft also wants to know, what's your opinion on Mexican zoning?

1044
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:39,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Pump it up.

1045
00:48:41,181 --> 00:48:41,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing wrong with that.

1046
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:42,682
[SPEAKER_22]: That's pretty hot.

1047
00:48:42,762 --> 00:48:43,943
[SPEAKER_03]: More games for everyone.

1048
00:48:43,983 --> 00:48:44,583
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good thing.

1049
00:48:45,364 --> 00:48:46,164
[SPEAKER_03]: No problems there.

1050
00:48:46,505 --> 00:48:50,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless the country actually bought the game.

1051
00:48:50,287 --> 00:48:51,668
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1052
00:48:53,249 --> 00:48:57,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Blackwolf says, how can you type with boxing gloves on your hands?

1053
00:49:01,049 --> 00:49:01,289
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1054
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:03,030
[SPEAKER_03]: A very large keyboard.

1055
00:49:07,793 --> 00:49:10,294
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn you people that bring Homestar Runner into this show.

1056
00:49:10,554 --> 00:49:12,355
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I love Homestar Runner.

1057
00:49:12,395 --> 00:49:14,596
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't complain, but you guys are funny.

1058
00:49:17,157 --> 00:49:17,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Checking the PMs.

1059
00:49:17,857 --> 00:49:18,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Checking the PMs.

1060
00:49:19,358 --> 00:49:19,998
[SPEAKER_13]: Email!

1061
00:49:20,178 --> 00:49:26,521
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTetsuya wants to know, so what's it like going from reporting on hypodermic needles in Solo 2000 to the Nintendo Wii?

1062
00:49:26,541 --> 00:49:27,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Nostalgia!

1063
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:28,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, nostalgia.

1064
00:49:28,949 --> 00:49:31,370
[SPEAKER_21]: That was one of our first beat-ups.

1065
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:33,311
[SPEAKER_21]: I remember calling that arcade.

1066
00:49:33,911 --> 00:49:35,532
[SPEAKER_21]: I said, oh, you'll have to talk to our manager.

1067
00:49:35,552 --> 00:49:36,592
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that, too.

1068
00:49:37,032 --> 00:49:38,072
[SPEAKER_03]: We were pretty cutting out.

1069
00:49:38,092 --> 00:49:41,414
[SPEAKER_21]: That was when I was sleeping in the Harry Potter room in the gay frat house.

1070
00:49:42,274 --> 00:49:42,974
[SPEAKER_03]: That was awesome.

1071
00:49:44,094 --> 00:49:44,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1072
00:49:44,695 --> 00:49:51,517
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, we were... I remember doing the recording a podcast while... No, not even a podcast.

1073
00:49:51,537 --> 00:49:54,638
[SPEAKER_21]: We were recording a live show while I was playing Beatmania.

1074
00:49:54,738 --> 00:49:57,439
[SPEAKER_21]: And they were trying to talk to me like, I'm trying to play 321 Stars, damn it!

1075
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:02,290
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's just been crazy.

1076
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:05,892
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been a lot of... It's funny how games have changed in the past four years.

1077
00:50:06,133 --> 00:50:08,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when we started doing this show, Max 2 was new in the arcades.

1078
00:50:09,255 --> 00:50:11,977
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we went through Extreme, we went through a drought, now we're into Supernova.

1079
00:50:13,718 --> 00:50:14,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, more songs.

1080
00:50:15,699 --> 00:50:17,221
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to get out of here before midnight tonight.

1081
00:50:17,621 --> 00:50:20,003
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68 wants to know, do any of you play O2 Jam?

1082
00:50:20,563 --> 00:50:25,246
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried it out about six months ago, and I had a pretty good time with it, I just haven't been back.

1083
00:50:25,907 --> 00:50:27,388
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't do well with the game's

1084
00:50:30,176 --> 00:50:30,497
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1085
00:50:31,317 --> 00:50:34,599
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just not good at checking in regularly with games like that for some reason.

1086
00:50:34,979 --> 00:50:39,462
[SPEAKER_03]: I did play recently a game that somewhat reminded me of it, though, which was the R2-B, which was kind of fun.

1087
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:42,004
[SPEAKER_03]: I should check it out again and see what's changed there.

1088
00:50:42,284 --> 00:50:43,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Has anyone else played O2 Jam?

1089
00:50:43,965 --> 00:50:44,065
[SPEAKER_03]: No?

1090
00:50:44,285 --> 00:50:44,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes?

1091
00:50:44,605 --> 00:50:44,705
[SPEAKER_03]: No?

1092
00:50:45,166 --> 00:50:47,947
[SPEAKER_21]: I looked at E3 and then walked on.

1093
00:50:48,728 --> 00:50:48,948
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1094
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:50,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1095
00:50:52,131 --> 00:50:56,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendomaniac64 wants to know, Could I race Loki in Mario Kart DS?

1096
00:50:56,513 --> 00:50:59,655
[SPEAKER_03]: I never got the chance and I've gone anti-snaking since nine months ago.

1097
00:51:01,916 --> 00:51:03,537
[SPEAKER_21]: That sounds like a 12-step program.

1098
00:51:03,557 --> 00:51:06,438
[SPEAKER_29]: I literally dusted off Mario Kart DS today.

1099
00:51:07,339 --> 00:51:09,920
[SPEAKER_29]: I haven't played that game in months.

1100
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:10,920
[SPEAKER_29]: Alright.

1101
00:51:13,362 --> 00:51:24,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Bandit wants to know, if train A is traveling at 50 miles per hour from Pittsburgh and train B is traveling at 35 miles per hour from California, which state will they meet in order to resupply the Orange Lounge Radio with more Chocobo Nuggets?

1102
00:51:25,204 --> 00:51:25,464
Wisconsin!

1103
00:51:26,084 --> 00:51:27,124
[SPEAKER_03]: African or European?

1104
00:51:29,105 --> 00:51:29,765
[SPEAKER_03]: African.

1105
00:51:32,065 --> 00:51:36,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Nazgul Slayer wants to know, question, is there a Castro District ghetto?

1106
00:51:37,326 --> 00:51:37,626
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1107
00:51:38,747 --> 00:51:40,207
[SPEAKER_03]: How about the whole place is ghetto?

1108
00:51:40,227 --> 00:51:40,267
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1109
00:51:41,448 --> 00:51:44,591
[SPEAKER_21]: I actually feel safer there than just about any other place in San Francisco.

1110
00:51:44,611 --> 00:51:47,273
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, actually, if you go around San Francisco, it's the safest place I feel.

1111
00:51:47,293 --> 00:51:49,615
[SPEAKER_21]: Except for the homeless man who was laying with his cock out.

1112
00:51:50,996 --> 00:51:59,623
[SPEAKER_19]: Around for your birthday, we found something in the window, and it's about that big around, and it's a penis, and we're going to catch you for your birthday.

1113
00:51:59,703 --> 00:52:01,905
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to chase you around the house with it.

1114
00:52:02,025 --> 00:52:04,407
[SPEAKER_21]: We also found you a codless bodysuit.

1115
00:52:05,748 --> 00:52:06,649
[SPEAKER_03]: That's disgusting.

1116
00:52:08,737 --> 00:52:12,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Ramma wants to know, you need to talk about the Spanish DDR movie.

1117
00:52:13,941 --> 00:52:14,801
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, that's right.

1118
00:52:14,841 --> 00:52:15,982
[SPEAKER_21]: I watched the trailer for that.

1119
00:52:16,002 --> 00:52:17,323
[SPEAKER_03]: La Machina de Balar.

1120
00:52:18,124 --> 00:52:19,124
[SPEAKER_21]: It actually looks kind of funny.

1121
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:21,346
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see the actual movie before I talk about it.

1122
00:52:21,366 --> 00:52:23,007
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, trailers can be deceiving, right?

1123
00:52:23,327 --> 00:52:24,128
[SPEAKER_21]: The trailer looked funny.

1124
00:52:24,408 --> 00:52:24,668
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1125
00:52:25,068 --> 00:52:29,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Poto wants to know, Dear Orange Laundry, if you had to be a species of bird, extinct or not, which would you be?

1126
00:52:29,591 --> 00:52:31,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Dodo.

1127
00:52:31,412 --> 00:52:33,414
[SPEAKER_03]: The Dodo, I'm hearing Drew and Chris say.

1128
00:52:33,434 --> 00:52:33,794
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?

1129
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:36,361
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be a... You'd be a fucking parrot.

1130
00:52:38,262 --> 00:52:44,923
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd be a pterodactyl.

1131
00:52:45,723 --> 00:52:46,623
[SPEAKER_21]: What is that bird?

1132
00:52:46,904 --> 00:52:50,384
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not a parrot, it's another bird that lives as long as a human does.

1133
00:52:50,404 --> 00:52:52,005
[SPEAKER_21]: Chicken?

1134
00:52:52,065 --> 00:52:52,885
[SPEAKER_21]: No, not chicken.

1135
00:52:55,345 --> 00:52:56,926
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be Toucan Sam.

1136
00:52:58,646 --> 00:53:03,907
[SPEAKER_21]: But I don't remember exactly what type of bird it is, but it's a bird that lives as long as a human and it's actually very intelligent.

1137
00:53:04,742 --> 00:53:05,282
[SPEAKER_21]: No, not a vulture.

1138
00:53:05,502 --> 00:53:06,523
[SPEAKER_21]: Ooh, I'd be a vulture.

1139
00:53:07,243 --> 00:53:08,924
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I'd be a raven because I'm all goth.

1140
00:53:09,484 --> 00:53:09,965
[SPEAKER_21]: Nevermore.

1141
00:53:10,565 --> 00:53:11,705
[SPEAKER_27]: What about the Norwegian blue?

1142
00:53:11,805 --> 00:53:12,706
[SPEAKER_27]: Lovely plumage.

1143
00:53:12,886 --> 00:53:13,946
Lovely plumage.

1144
00:53:14,587 --> 00:53:14,867
[SPEAKER_27]: All right.

1145
00:53:14,907 --> 00:53:16,168
[SPEAKER_21]: He's pining for the fjords.

1146
00:53:16,648 --> 00:53:17,808
[SPEAKER_21]: He's not pining.

1147
00:53:17,828 --> 00:53:20,310
[SPEAKER_21]: He's fast on.

1148
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:22,591
[SPEAKER_21]: This is an expert.

1149
00:53:24,271 --> 00:53:26,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to the next question here.

1150
00:53:26,673 --> 00:53:29,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Socorina wants to know, do you guys have VJ Army accounts?

1151
00:53:29,474 --> 00:53:30,815
[SPEAKER_03]: And if so, what's your DJ name?

1152
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:33,856
[SPEAKER_21]: I do have one and I haven't ever updated it.

1153
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:35,510
[SPEAKER_21]: 8th 8th Loki

1154
00:54:01,226 --> 00:54:01,647
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know.

1155
00:54:01,667 --> 00:54:03,008
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't play 2DX really.

1156
00:54:03,028 --> 00:54:03,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, that's right.

1157
00:54:03,588 --> 00:54:04,449
[SPEAKER_03]: You hate 2DX.

1158
00:54:04,469 --> 00:54:05,069
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't hate it.

1159
00:54:05,089 --> 00:54:05,950
[SPEAKER_29]: I just don't play it.

1160
00:54:07,151 --> 00:54:10,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Legend of Zaku wants to know, do you guys have any video game inspired drink recipes?

1161
00:54:11,153 --> 00:54:11,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh.

1162
00:54:12,214 --> 00:54:12,454
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1163
00:54:12,815 --> 00:54:14,056
[SPEAKER_21]: Any what inspired drink recipes?

1164
00:54:14,076 --> 00:54:15,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Video game inspired drink recipes.

1165
00:54:15,917 --> 00:54:17,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Like mixed drinks that are inspired by video games.

1166
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:20,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Burning Heat featuring Hot Damn?

1167
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:21,121
[SPEAKER_21]: Burning Heat.

1168
00:54:21,141 --> 00:54:21,601
[SPEAKER_21]: Featuring Hot Damn?

1169
00:54:21,861 --> 00:54:22,562
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good idea.

1170
00:54:22,582 --> 00:54:25,344
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, I'm going to make up one right now.

1171
00:54:25,744 --> 00:54:26,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1172
00:54:27,785 --> 00:54:27,945
[SPEAKER_21]: It's...

1173
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:36,423
[SPEAKER_21]: Goldschlager and Midori Goldschlager and Midori, remember that one?

1174
00:54:36,483 --> 00:54:38,185
[SPEAKER_21]: Goldschlager and Midori

1175
00:55:00,114 --> 00:55:02,676
[SPEAKER_21]: and it's made with Goldschlager and Jägermeister.

1176
00:55:03,858 --> 00:55:05,879
[SPEAKER_21]: Two of the nasty and cheap tequila.

1177
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,882
[SPEAKER_21]: And when you puke, that's the game.

1178
00:55:08,902 --> 00:55:11,364
[SPEAKER_21]: Because that's what Abydox look like.

1179
00:55:11,545 --> 00:55:12,886
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, look.

1180
00:55:13,046 --> 00:55:14,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a couple more quick questions.

1181
00:55:14,848 --> 00:55:16,189
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to get to all the questions tonight.

1182
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:18,271
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize, guys.

1183
00:55:19,732 --> 00:55:20,653
[SPEAKER_19]: I love Abydox.

1184
00:55:20,773 --> 00:55:23,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Duckator wants to know, do coconuts migrate?

1185
00:55:23,596 --> 00:55:24,777
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1186
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,864
[SPEAKER_21]: Coconut is a non-migratory as it would be carried by an African swallow or European swallow.

1187
00:55:31,584 --> 00:55:36,868
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's funny is once I went to the grocery store, my old roommate and I were in college and we just bought a coconut because we just wanted to play with it.

1188
00:55:37,128 --> 00:55:41,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, we wanted to see if we could open it using household tools because we didn't know.

1189
00:55:41,811 --> 00:55:43,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you only see on TV.

1190
00:55:43,493 --> 00:55:45,454
[SPEAKER_03]: You were just interested in having a hairy ball.

1191
00:55:45,734 --> 00:55:46,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, go to hell.

1192
00:55:47,515 --> 00:55:48,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Just fucking go to hell.

1193
00:55:49,537 --> 00:55:49,837
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1194
00:55:52,351 --> 00:55:53,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, two more questions.

1195
00:55:53,211 --> 00:55:56,974
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100Matt wants to know, ask Loki when he will do another Loki Fusion.

1196
00:55:58,075 --> 00:55:59,336
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't done one in a while.

1197
00:55:59,376 --> 00:56:03,659
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep toying with it, and it's just, it's like writer's block, you know.

1198
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,942
[SPEAKER_03]: For those that don't know Loki Fusion, you have your own DDR remix songs, right?

1199
00:56:07,242 --> 00:56:07,482
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

1200
00:56:07,662 --> 00:56:11,806
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're on, what, MySpace.com slash Loki Fusion?

1201
00:56:12,026 --> 00:56:12,386
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

1202
00:56:12,726 --> 00:56:14,468
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1203
00:56:16,229 --> 00:56:17,290
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, last question.

1204
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:18,871
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is a great question to end on.

1205
00:56:20,055 --> 00:56:21,456
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a serious one, okay?

1206
00:56:21,656 --> 00:56:23,738
[SPEAKER_03]: You may have to think about this one for a minute, but everybody's got to answer.

1207
00:56:24,618 --> 00:56:25,799
[SPEAKER_03]: At least the host, the three of us do.

1208
00:56:26,539 --> 00:56:31,643
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could go back to the beginning prior to the show starting... This came from Solar Wing, by the way.

1209
00:56:31,663 --> 00:56:32,243
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I said that.

1210
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:37,606
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could go back to the beginning prior to the show starting, would you do it again or do it differently?

1211
00:56:41,829 --> 00:56:42,469
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a tough one.

1212
00:56:42,489 --> 00:56:42,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1213
00:56:44,608 --> 00:56:49,849
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have said we should have had Loki on since episode one as a full-blown co-host because we just didn't know him well enough then.

1214
00:56:49,889 --> 00:56:51,610
[SPEAKER_03]: But he wasn't a true co-host until episode 20.

1215
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:52,410
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people don't know that.

1216
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:57,371
[SPEAKER_03]: But he wasn't truly a recognized co-host of the show until... He was kind of like a Drew.

1217
00:56:57,391 --> 00:56:58,492
[SPEAKER_03]: He just showed up all the fucking time.

1218
00:56:59,072 --> 00:57:01,533
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, he got promoted to co-host in episode 20.

1219
00:57:01,593 --> 00:57:03,433
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have said we would have had Loki on board episode one.

1220
00:57:06,794 --> 00:57:07,174
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1221
00:57:07,194 --> 00:57:08,114
[SPEAKER_21]: I know what I would do different.

1222
00:57:08,214 --> 00:57:08,374
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1223
00:57:08,495 --> 00:57:11,095
[SPEAKER_21]: Not use that retarded headset because I had a migraine the whole episode.

1224
00:57:12,256 --> 00:57:12,516
[SPEAKER_29]: Loki?

1225
00:57:13,576 --> 00:57:13,596
[SPEAKER_29]: I...

1226
00:57:14,446 --> 00:57:16,788
[SPEAKER_29]: This doesn't really have anything to do with Orange Lounge, though.

1227
00:57:17,369 --> 00:57:18,870
[SPEAKER_29]: I wouldn't have built the cabinet!

1228
00:57:22,032 --> 00:57:23,013
[SPEAKER_29]: I know, you spent so much.

1229
00:57:23,033 --> 00:57:25,755
[SPEAKER_29]: And I threw it away, like a baby.

1230
00:57:26,536 --> 00:57:28,277
[SPEAKER_29]: Aborted and thrown in the dumpster.

1231
00:57:28,938 --> 00:57:31,059
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there's anything else.

1232
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,581
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard, because, you know, we've just learned so many things.

1233
00:57:33,601 --> 00:57:35,103
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I still have those DDR pads.

1234
00:57:35,703 --> 00:57:39,026
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I would have tried harder in the beginning to really...

1235
00:57:39,841 --> 00:57:47,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Believe that what we were doing was not just something we were fucking around online, but it was really generally something people wanted to listen to, and I think I would have tried to promote us better in the beginning.

1236
00:57:47,224 --> 00:57:48,864
[SPEAKER_29]: Or more general gaming, maybe?

1237
00:57:49,364 --> 00:57:51,245
[SPEAKER_03]: I think in retrospect, I don't know, though.

1238
00:57:51,325 --> 00:57:54,106
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we owe the Bomani scene a lot.

1239
00:57:54,246 --> 00:57:59,268
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, honestly, though, I would have made the shift to general gaming about a year sooner than we did.

1240
00:57:59,288 --> 00:58:03,490
[SPEAKER_29]: We should have done podcasting, because we would have beat everybody to it by like two years.

1241
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:03,950
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

1242
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:06,691
[SPEAKER_03]: We should have invented podcasting, yeah.

1243
00:58:06,711 --> 00:58:07,371
[SPEAKER_21]: Podcasting?

1244
00:58:09,107 --> 00:58:09,627
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura.com

1245
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:40,352
[SPEAKER_21]: I do not regret a single second of it because that makes us what we are right now.

1246
00:58:40,812 --> 00:58:42,212
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100 Matt brings up a good point.

1247
00:58:42,273 --> 00:58:44,233
[SPEAKER_03]: We were one of the first shows to introduce Skype calls.

1248
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:50,937
[SPEAKER_03]: People don't recognize that, but we were probably like, if not, I would almost challenge, we were the first internet radio show to do Skype calls.

1249
00:58:51,157 --> 00:58:52,918
[SPEAKER_03]: I would challenge that.

1250
00:58:53,118 --> 00:58:54,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Find me a show that was doing it before we were.

1251
00:58:55,719 --> 00:58:57,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we got on board with that Skype thing really early.

1252
00:58:58,520 --> 00:58:58,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you think?

1253
00:58:59,101 --> 00:59:00,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we were doing it before we were even podcasting.

1254
00:59:02,222 --> 00:59:03,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, when Skype was in beta, we were doing it.

1255
00:59:04,113 --> 00:59:06,305
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, I think my Skype is still the beta version.

1256
00:59:10,394 --> 00:59:14,917
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to sound egotistical, but I like to think of the fact that we've been on the cutting edge of a few things.

1257
00:59:14,997 --> 00:59:19,899
[SPEAKER_29]: The PSP web browser, granted we haven't done too much with that.

1258
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:30,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I think we do a great show here, I think we owe the fact that we were one of the first gaming podcasts with an already established fan base thanks to our live show is the reason why we won the podcast award last year.

1259
00:59:31,425 --> 00:59:34,206
[SPEAKER_21]: I also think that we're not afraid to go there.

1260
00:59:35,747 --> 00:59:40,510
[SPEAKER_21]: That's one thing that we've always tried to hold on to is we don't really censor ourselves.

1261
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:42,332
[SPEAKER_21]: We give it as it is.

1262
00:59:42,672 --> 00:59:44,814
[SPEAKER_21]: If we get an explicit tag one week, fuck it.

1263
00:59:45,935 --> 00:59:46,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good point.

1264
00:59:46,995 --> 00:59:47,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good point.

1265
00:59:47,876 --> 00:59:48,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck it.

1266
00:59:48,837 --> 00:59:49,237
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1267
00:59:49,297 --> 00:59:49,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Right in the ear.

1268
00:59:49,998 --> 00:59:51,239
[SPEAKER_21]: Fuck the fucking fuckers.

1269
00:59:51,699 --> 00:59:52,099
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1270
00:59:52,580 --> 01:00:00,946
[SPEAKER_03]: On that note, I wanted to go around and see if anyone had any speeches, things they wanted to say to close out the show tonight.

1271
01:00:02,127 --> 01:00:03,008
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to say I'll start.

1272
01:00:05,057 --> 01:00:10,841
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a really interesting 200 episodes and I've learned a lot.

1273
01:00:11,521 --> 01:00:17,965
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've received such wonderful compliments from you guys out there on the internet.

1274
01:00:18,005 --> 01:00:22,888
[SPEAKER_03]: And it makes me feel so good because, you know, when I was in college, I did not know what the hell I wanted to do with my life.

1275
01:00:22,948 --> 01:00:30,693
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was starting in, I was doing media arts for a while, meaning I was going to go into television and radio.

1276
01:00:31,053 --> 01:00:33,435
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was just convinced I was not cut out for radio.

1277
01:00:33,871 --> 01:00:38,854
[SPEAKER_03]: because I was not going to blow my way to the top, which is what most people do in the radio industry.

1278
01:00:38,914 --> 01:00:43,456
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people that you hear on the afternoon drive probably fuck someone to get there.

1279
01:00:43,536 --> 01:00:44,777
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wasn't down with that.

1280
01:00:44,877 --> 01:00:52,300
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to do something, you know, I didn't, that's when I knew I did not really want to play with the big boys and work that way, that I wanted to kind of do my own thing.

1281
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:57,423
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really appreciate Travis kind of noticing that first on Interstation Live and kind of

1282
01:00:58,477 --> 01:01:11,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Joining me to be – or asking me to be a part of his show to kind of bring that out of me a little bit, which enabled me to get the idea going here with DarkSakura, who I think felt very enabled by that program as well, to kind of come do our own thing here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1283
01:01:11,505 --> 01:01:12,826
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been a fantastic experience.

1284
01:01:13,166 --> 01:01:24,413
[SPEAKER_03]: And to have come now to this point where we are working with a guy who started a television network about gaming is just –

1285
01:01:25,635 --> 01:01:27,356
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the path I wanted to take.

1286
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:28,117
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

1287
01:01:28,297 --> 01:01:30,119
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't want to blow my way to the top.

1288
01:01:30,179 --> 01:01:34,322
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to work through the back door like a typical gay man.

1289
01:01:35,063 --> 01:01:35,723
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm very happy.

1290
01:01:35,924 --> 01:01:38,626
[SPEAKER_03]: And DarkSakura and Loki, you guys are awesome.

1291
01:01:38,666 --> 01:01:43,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, I really wish we would have had you on episode one because we didn't know you.

1292
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:45,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Despite what you say, we didn't really know you.

1293
01:01:46,252 --> 01:01:47,913
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's been awesome.

1294
01:01:47,953 --> 01:01:49,575
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we lived together, we had a great time.

1295
01:01:49,615 --> 01:01:52,397
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think we ever fought once, which made you a really great roommate.

1296
01:01:52,437 --> 01:01:52,577
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

1297
01:01:54,045 --> 01:01:54,985
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1298
01:02:22,651 --> 01:02:23,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh god, I just love you.

1299
01:02:23,772 --> 01:02:24,492
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you're so smart.

1300
01:02:26,173 --> 01:02:26,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's the point.

1301
01:02:27,293 --> 01:02:31,175
[SPEAKER_03]: So, thank you for everything.

1302
01:02:31,495 --> 01:02:37,958
[SPEAKER_03]: And don't ever let internet fanboy people who are pissed off that some girl likes to yell at them once in a while ever get under your skin.

1303
01:02:38,218 --> 01:02:40,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know it was hard at first when we first went podcasting.

1304
01:02:40,699 --> 01:02:41,899
[SPEAKER_03]: But they suck.

1305
01:02:45,896 --> 01:02:48,658
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't say anything right now because I'm emo.

1306
01:02:48,879 --> 01:02:50,040
[SPEAKER_29]: Loki, do you want to say anything?

1307
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:51,641
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know what the hell to say.

1308
01:02:51,661 --> 01:02:53,122
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm not good at this stuff.

1309
01:02:53,483 --> 01:02:55,284
[SPEAKER_29]: No, it's been fun.

1310
01:02:55,624 --> 01:02:56,946
[SPEAKER_29]: I like doing the show.

1311
01:02:57,346 --> 01:03:02,650
[SPEAKER_29]: It's just, you know, Nellie doesn't probably like too much that I spend three hours of my week every week.

1312
01:03:03,271 --> 01:03:08,776
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, mentally, probably way too much time on the show.

1313
01:03:08,896 --> 01:03:11,178
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, my God, like,

1314
01:03:11,823 --> 01:03:12,643
[SPEAKER_29]: Do stuff at work.

1315
01:03:12,683 --> 01:03:13,803
[SPEAKER_29]: It's all game related.

1316
01:03:13,944 --> 01:03:15,104
[SPEAKER_29]: It's always game related.

1317
01:03:15,424 --> 01:03:16,924
[SPEAKER_29]: Everything's always game related with me.

1318
01:03:17,384 --> 01:03:18,145
[SPEAKER_29]: Get a life, Loki.

1319
01:03:20,025 --> 01:03:22,946
[SPEAKER_29]: Seriously, I think getting married would change everything.

1320
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:26,627
[SPEAKER_29]: No, it doesn't.

1321
01:03:26,647 --> 01:03:32,808
[SPEAKER_29]: The only thing I'm focusing on now is taking the show to the next step.

1322
01:03:32,908 --> 01:03:33,328
[SPEAKER_29]: Not letting the

1323
01:03:37,304 --> 01:03:43,848
[SPEAKER_29]: Other big sites out there bother you with the fact that people take them more seriously and that kind of stuff.

1324
01:03:43,868 --> 01:03:48,691
[SPEAKER_29]: Because you either have to have a big financial backing or you just got to earn the respect for it.

1325
01:03:48,751 --> 01:03:52,774
[SPEAKER_29]: So all that comes in time and money.

1326
01:03:53,554 --> 01:03:54,555
[SPEAKER_29]: So I don't know.

1327
01:03:54,735 --> 01:03:55,936
[SPEAKER_29]: It's just going to be interesting.

1328
01:03:56,056 --> 01:03:57,877
[SPEAKER_29]: I have no plans on quitting the show.

1329
01:03:57,937 --> 01:04:00,158
[SPEAKER_29]: So however long it goes.

1330
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:03,800
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1331
01:04:04,561 --> 01:04:04,741
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

1332
01:04:05,838 --> 01:04:06,919
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1333
01:04:33,001 --> 01:04:34,201
[SPEAKER_21]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1334
01:05:03,504 --> 01:05:14,787
[SPEAKER_21]: Because there's still this vast majority of, and no offense to any of our guys listening, there's still this vast majority of men out there who think that just because they have a cock, they can tell women what to do.

1335
01:05:14,887 --> 01:05:23,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think G4 fucked a lot of that for everybody, for girls everywhere, because a lot of girl gamers on that, girl gamers, quote unquote, are just a set of tits.

1336
01:05:24,309 --> 01:05:26,910
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dark Sakura is so much more than just a nice set of tits.

1337
01:05:27,170 --> 01:05:28,690
[SPEAKER_21]: Although they are nice.

1338
01:05:29,090 --> 01:05:30,350
[SPEAKER_03]: They are nice tits, don't get me wrong.

1339
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:32,971
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's just much more than that.

1340
01:05:33,607 --> 01:05:48,357
[SPEAKER_21]: But, you know, it actually gave, doing this show just from, even from getting on Under Sedation because it was you and Jessica, you know, Rob and Jessica.

1341
01:05:48,578 --> 01:05:50,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of a nice set of tits.

1342
01:05:50,359 --> 01:05:51,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1343
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:52,760
[SPEAKER_03]: She was wonderful too.

1344
01:05:52,801 --> 01:05:56,783
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to say thank you to Jessica because, I'll go back to that in a minute.

1345
01:05:56,803 --> 01:05:57,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.

1346
01:05:57,144 --> 01:06:00,386
[SPEAKER_21]: But you guys brought me in on Under Sedation and I had been just sort of,

1347
01:06:01,785 --> 01:06:09,988
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I've always been outspoken in front of people, but very nervous in large groups, you know, and I really got me over a lot of my, my shyness.

1348
01:06:10,148 --> 01:06:23,913
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that my residual shyness gave me a lot more ability or I say confidence to really say, you know, tact is one thing, but censoring yourself for the sake of

1349
01:06:24,443 --> 01:06:33,407
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, censoring the truth, I think, or how you really feel for the sake of political correctness or somebody else's retarded sensitivities.

1350
01:06:34,467 --> 01:06:49,934
[SPEAKER_21]: Doing the show has completely opened up that side of me that has given me courage to stand up for myself as a woman, not just to the gaming community, but at work, you know, in my daily life, you know.

1351
01:06:50,923 --> 01:06:56,706
[SPEAKER_21]: I feel completely... I mean, doing this show has been such a confidence booster.

1352
01:06:57,566 --> 01:07:07,791
[SPEAKER_21]: And I thank everybody who has supported my loudmouth, outspoken, bitchy, Aries womanliness.

1353
01:07:08,891 --> 01:07:09,912
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to thank all of you.

1354
01:07:11,592 --> 01:07:14,494
[SPEAKER_21]: And whoever's king my Lancer needs to die right now.

1355
01:07:16,415 --> 01:07:16,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing.

1356
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:17,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1357
01:07:17,975 --> 01:07:18,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys so much.

1358
01:07:21,905 --> 01:07:24,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Drew, and Chris, if you guys want to add anything.

1359
01:07:24,887 --> 01:07:25,408
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to.

1360
01:07:26,689 --> 01:07:28,530
[SPEAKER_27]: Shit, guys, it's been a wild ride.

1361
01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:30,431
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, I've been with you guys since Episode 2.

1362
01:07:31,112 --> 01:07:33,153
[SPEAKER_27]: We jumped the shark in Episode 1, apparently.

1363
01:07:34,294 --> 01:07:38,537
[SPEAKER_27]: But I've been here for the whole downhill ride, and I was listening when I was 16.

1364
01:07:38,597 --> 01:07:42,240
[SPEAKER_27]: It's kind of funny that this show sort of defined...

1365
01:07:42,987 --> 01:08:12,073
[SPEAKER_27]: my adult social life I grew up with this show and it's kind of sad and it's kind of cool at the same time because for the past few years this show has been the main constant and I go from awkward teen to intern to scapegoat to bad joke master and you know what I'm still here the show is still going strong and I hope we continue this course for a long time to come

1366
01:08:14,278 --> 01:08:18,180
[SPEAKER_27]: This is the best thing on the internet right now, at least my opinion.

1367
01:08:40,163 --> 01:08:43,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Jessica and I couldn't fucking stand each other the last year that we did Under Sedation Live.

1368
01:08:44,726 --> 01:08:46,227
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's cool, we're cool now.

1369
01:08:46,347 --> 01:08:48,328
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, so, you know, it's okay that I say that.

1370
01:08:48,348 --> 01:08:50,629
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't say that a couple years ago, but I can say it now.

1371
01:08:50,989 --> 01:08:52,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Jessica and I could not fucking stand each other.

1372
01:08:52,650 --> 01:08:54,712
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was really hard to do that program.

1373
01:08:55,192 --> 01:09:01,936
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I know from experience that being such good friends with you guys is...

1374
01:09:03,052 --> 01:09:03,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Such a relief.

1375
01:09:03,953 --> 01:09:06,055
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes doing this show so much easier.

1376
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:12,520
[SPEAKER_03]: And I truly do look forward to having this show every week as being a way that we can hang out with each other.

1377
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:15,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Because sometimes our lives are so busy, we can't do it without this constant.

1378
01:09:16,104 --> 01:09:21,288
[SPEAKER_21]: I do have to say, though, just to yours and Jessica's credit, you both hit it very well on there.

1379
01:09:21,989 --> 01:09:22,849
[SPEAKER_21]: That's professionalism.

1380
01:09:22,869 --> 01:09:29,095
[SPEAKER_03]: When I saw Chicago, the end of that movie, and if anybody wants to know exactly what it was like,

1381
01:09:29,554 --> 01:09:30,194
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1382
01:09:44,602 --> 01:09:50,807
[SPEAKER_03]: I just remember listening to that episode and sitting at my computer about to bawl because you know what my position was in between that.

1383
01:09:50,847 --> 01:09:52,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris, did you want to say anything?

1384
01:09:52,448 --> 01:09:52,549
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1385
01:10:10,425 --> 01:10:11,726
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know how much I can contribute.

1386
01:10:11,786 --> 01:10:13,947
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm kind of a new listener.

1387
01:10:16,568 --> 01:10:18,409
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm a noob.

1388
01:10:20,311 --> 01:10:24,553
[SPEAKER_19]: I actually met you, Rob, the first time when we saw Silent Hill.

1389
01:10:25,310 --> 01:10:30,053
[SPEAKER_19]: That was the first time I met you, and I listened to a podcast right before that.

1390
01:10:31,034 --> 01:10:35,197
[SPEAKER_19]: And I've never really been into video games.

1391
01:10:35,257 --> 01:10:44,023
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I like video games, but I'm one of those people that is really interested in something, but has absolutely no idea what you guys are talking about.

1392
01:10:44,583 --> 01:10:48,086
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's been very educational listening to you guys, and I just like...

1393
01:10:50,851 --> 01:10:51,472
[SPEAKER_19]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1394
01:11:19,429 --> 01:11:21,211
[SPEAKER_19]: I am normal, average.

1395
01:11:22,212 --> 01:11:22,892
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Rob, though.

1396
01:11:23,693 --> 01:11:25,775
[SPEAKER_19]: Shut up, Rob.

1397
01:11:25,795 --> 01:11:27,417
[SPEAKER_21]: We have one more person that has a speech.

1398
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:30,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1399
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:36,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Black Wolf in our chat room says, and you know, guesting on OLR was a highlight of my podcasting career.

1400
01:11:37,335 --> 01:11:38,275
[SPEAKER_03]: You sappy bitch.

1401
01:11:38,355 --> 01:11:41,256
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got a great podcast.

1402
01:11:42,296 --> 01:11:46,097
[SPEAKER_03]: He's hit 50 himself, and he's done Dragon Con.

1403
01:11:46,117 --> 01:11:47,957
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he's done cons bigger than we have.

1404
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:49,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get sappy.

1405
01:11:49,738 --> 01:11:52,898
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know if it's the champagne, but I do feel a little weepy.

1406
01:11:52,978 --> 01:11:53,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have another glass?

1407
01:11:54,059 --> 01:11:54,379
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

1408
01:11:54,999 --> 01:11:55,599
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, look.

1409
01:11:56,639 --> 01:11:57,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing.

1410
01:11:57,259 --> 01:12:04,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's turn this show around and start to end this thing on a positive note, because for a long...

1411
01:12:06,983 --> 01:12:10,885
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually are going to be ending on a bit of a high note, but I ain't singing it.

1412
01:12:11,725 --> 01:12:12,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the deal.

1413
01:12:13,005 --> 01:12:24,069
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been a moment in Orange Lounge Radio's history that people, for whatever reason, just seem to love and have never shut up about since the night it happened.

1414
01:12:24,109 --> 01:12:25,509
[SPEAKER_03]: The night it happened was November 16, 2003.

1415
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:31,011
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it went down in a lot of people's minds.

1416
01:12:31,776 --> 01:12:33,237
[SPEAKER_03]: in Orange Lounge Radio's history.

1417
01:12:33,257 --> 01:12:33,977
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's the weird thing.

1418
01:12:34,017 --> 01:12:36,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie wasn't even there that night when this happened.

1419
01:12:36,279 --> 01:12:38,720
[SPEAKER_21]: I was staying in the Harry Potter room in the gay front house.

1420
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:47,065
[SPEAKER_03]: And folks have been begging and begging to please post this somewhere so I can download it.

1421
01:12:47,405 --> 01:12:48,006
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

1422
01:12:49,066 --> 01:12:52,769
[SPEAKER_03]: So here it is, boys and girls, on this special 200th podcast.

1423
01:12:53,489 --> 01:12:56,931
[SPEAKER_03]: A little clip from episode 69 of Orange Lounge Radio.

1424
01:12:57,511 --> 01:12:59,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki Plays Karaoke Revolution.

1425
01:13:03,537 --> 01:13:07,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, I just have to say, the sound quality sucks because we were on dial-up back then, okay?

1426
01:13:07,673 --> 01:13:08,677
[SPEAKER_03]: So, just bear with us.

1427
01:13:13,447 --> 01:13:22,011
[SPEAKER_15]: Hiho, Kermit the E-Fog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

1428
01:13:22,051 --> 01:13:32,975
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and as promised, we're now going to show off our karaoke talents in a round of Karaoke Revolution.

1429
01:13:33,315 --> 01:13:35,296
[SPEAKER_18]: Say it again.

1430
01:13:36,237 --> 01:13:38,057
[SPEAKER_13]: Um... Dream...

1435
01:15:32,347 --> 01:15:36,908
[SPEAKER_18]: That's pretty amazing, I think, since I can't sing worth a shit.

1436
01:15:40,689 --> 01:15:42,529
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh yeah, play the instrumental solo.

1437

1442
01:16:33,775 --> 01:16:35,217
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sick of this song.

1443
01:16:35,497 --> 01:16:37,399
[SPEAKER_18]: You're going to really die.

1444
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:40,902
[SPEAKER_18]: God, this is long.

1445
01:16:41,482 --> 01:16:43,764
[SPEAKER_18]: It just doesn't fucking end.

1446
01:16:43,784 --> 01:16:45,766
[SPEAKER_18]: It just keeps on going on.

1447
01:16:48,388 --> 01:16:50,770
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to kill anyone in the chat room that has a recording of this.

1448
01:16:50,970 --> 01:16:52,051
[SPEAKER_18]: You're going to so die.

1449
01:16:52,572 --> 01:16:53,613
[SPEAKER_18]: I know where you live.

1450
01:16:54,654 --> 01:16:57,736
[SPEAKER_17]: As a reminder, the show will be broadcast this week on Thursday.

1451
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:08,010
[SPEAKER_17]: A score of 6,964 points for Loki Not even a gold record There is no justice in this world Okay

1452
01:17:09,418 --> 01:17:11,399
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, we're going to shut the game off now.

1453
01:17:11,479 --> 01:17:13,499
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh my god, I have not laughed that hard.

1454
01:17:13,519 --> 01:17:15,360
[SPEAKER_17]: I laughed so hard my head scared.

1455
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:17,141
[SPEAKER_17]: I laughed so hard I peed, okay?

1456
01:17:17,161 --> 01:17:18,581
[SPEAKER_17]: I peed a little.

1457
01:17:19,381 --> 01:17:20,442
[SPEAKER_17]: I peed a little bit.

1458
01:17:21,582 --> 01:17:23,243
[SPEAKER_21]: I got to hear this when I came back.

1459
01:17:23,563 --> 01:17:24,583
[SPEAKER_03]: You weren't even there that week.

1460
01:17:25,163 --> 01:17:28,184
[SPEAKER_03]: The girl in there was our original show to a madam's name.

1461
01:17:28,324 --> 01:17:29,405
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1462
01:17:29,745 --> 01:17:31,325
[SPEAKER_21]: She needs to come back and be on the show soon.

1463
01:17:31,525 --> 01:17:31,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki?

1464
01:17:36,227 --> 01:17:36,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Well...

1465
01:17:37,330 --> 01:17:38,210
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll put them up.

1466
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:42,812
[SPEAKER_03]: God, our show sounded like shit back then, didn't it?

1467
01:17:44,232 --> 01:17:44,572
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1468
01:17:44,612 --> 01:17:47,873
[SPEAKER_03]: We should have never been a dialogue-friendly station.

1469
01:17:48,474 --> 01:17:54,275
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, I have both recordings already edited out.

1470
01:17:54,295 --> 01:17:57,437
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm not sure if they were recorded on my computer at the time.

1471
01:17:57,457 --> 01:17:58,657
[SPEAKER_29]: I think they were edited out of the show.

1472
01:17:58,877 --> 01:17:59,757
[SPEAKER_27]: Loki's going to kill me.

1473
01:17:59,797 --> 01:18:00,898
[SPEAKER_27]: I have the deep, dark secret.

1474
01:18:01,838 --> 01:18:03,318
[SPEAKER_27]: I was the one who distributed that.

1475
01:18:04,359 --> 01:18:04,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

1476
01:18:04,739 --> 01:18:05,119
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

1477
01:18:05,731 --> 01:18:11,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing, episode 300 we have is complicated, but until then... No, now listen.

1478
01:18:12,956 --> 01:18:21,381
[SPEAKER_29]: Here's what we'll do, because the MP3s on the MySpace page have been getting kind of stale, so we'll put both of them up.

1479
01:18:21,521 --> 01:18:23,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we'll see what we can do.

1480
01:18:24,183 --> 01:18:25,484
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought you sounded okay.

1481
01:18:26,825 --> 01:18:28,166
[SPEAKER_29]: You should have heard complicated.

1482
01:18:29,527 --> 01:18:33,369
[SPEAKER_29]: They made me pick a random song, so it was just like... Avril Lavigne's complicated?

1483
01:18:33,849 --> 01:18:34,630
[SPEAKER_19]: Now that's sexy.

1484
01:18:35,931 --> 01:18:36,512
