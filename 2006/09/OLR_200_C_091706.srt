00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,000
To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this very special Part C to celebrate our 200th episode.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Now I want to warn you guys, if this is your first time downloading Orange Lounge Radio, this is going to be a little bit different.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This is not your typical segment of Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So I urge you to check out orangeloungeradio.com and dip back in our podcast feed and check out Parts A and B.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We envision this section of the show to be a little more like our afterbirth segment.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
For those that listen live, you know what that is.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's a little bonus thing we do just for the live listeners.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We do have a little bit more game news.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We just filled up with stuff in Part B and just had a little more we wanted to talk about here in Part C.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
But first, before we get to that gaming news, what we did is we brought in a little bit of champagne.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I promise there will be liquor tonight in one form or another.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We're going to do a toast here to our 200th episode.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Does anyone want to make the toast or should I just do it or what?

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Anyone want to say a little bit?

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Alright.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I would say it's been a wonderful 200 episodes with you all and we're going to keep doing this as long as we possibly can.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Hopefully another 200 episodes in the future.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Loki, anything you want to say?

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I can't reach.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Alright.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Dr. Sakura?

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
To quote, this is the thing I always toast.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Here's to us.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Who's like us?

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Damn few.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And they're all dead.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Toast, toast.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yay.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Clean.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You can't hear the cleans because they're plastic.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That's some good Corbel.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Alright.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You're not a big champagne fan?

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I hate champagne.

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I like champagne but I really like it and a good mimosa.

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Why can't we just toast Guinness?

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Okay.

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
When we reach 300, we toast Guinness.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Or 250 is a big number too.

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I don't know.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I think it's going to be more like the fifth birthday because fifth birthday is pretty big so we'll see.

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Anyway, Jamie already burped the Corbel.

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That's amazing.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
That's some fizzy stuff.

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That is amazing.

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Alright.

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We have a little bit of extra stories here for you guys.

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Loki?

52
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yes.

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
A lot of fun stuff for part C.

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Anyways, I really shouldn't be paying attention.

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Thank you Chat Room for your well wishes by the way.

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So, there's been a lot of rumors going around about the 360.

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:39,000
One that keeps popping back up is Microsoft's going to release a brand new 360 with an internal HD DVD drive.

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Once again, they have said no.

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We are not releasing a SKU with an HD DVD drive.

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It says, it turns out you want to say in how you spend your entertainment dollars.

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So, who are we to burden every customer with the cost of expensive movie technology?

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Ooh, sub Sony.

63
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Ouch.

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
That was Bill Gates whipping it out right there.

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
No, that was actually a generic Microsoft employees.

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Sorry, that was a Microsoft employee whipping out their cock.

67
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
No, that was one of their technical writers.

68
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I see.

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
This is why I'm in school to be a tech writer.

70
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Alright.

71
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So that I too can whip out the corporate cock.

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I don't need a corporate cock.

73
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I just need a cock.

74
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Your girlfriend is still bigger.

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Anyway.

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:54,000
There is actually the Game U College Tour will be making the rounds.

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It will be featuring the Xbox 360, Xbox and PC gaming.

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The tour will last three months and it will hit up 40 different college campuses.

79
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's produced by Game Informer, Norcent TV and Mountain Dew and a bunch of other folks.

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And it's going to hopefully reach 90,000 different people.

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Some of the titles that are included are Madden NFL 07, blah, blah, blah.

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Rainbow Six, Saints Row, Mortal Combat Armageddon, America's Army Special Forces,

83
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Splitter's Little Agent, blah, blah, blah, Project Gotham 3, Dead Rising.

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
In other words, all the games Jamie does not enjoy playing.

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Hey, Dead Rising.

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Okay, that's cool.

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Dead Rising was hot.

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And there will be a Madden NFL 07 football field goal competition and the winners take home $1,000 as the prize.

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And Game Informer will have a Halo 2 competition each place with an unnamed prize it seems.

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So the tour starts on September 14th at the University of Arizona in Tucson.

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Other schools that will be visited will be just general places.

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
They will be going to Austin, Texas, University of Texas, University of Missouri, Wichita State.

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Vanderbilt, Northern Kentucky, Temple University, Penn State.

94
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:38,000
They will be going to State University of New York in Buffalo and Miami University of Ohio.

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
That always makes me laugh.

96
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And of course Notre Dame in Indiana.

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
All right.

98
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Well, if the game isn't coming to you, maybe you need to bring the game with you everywhere you go.

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Now you know those little plug and play things, right?

100
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The little joysticks you can plug into your TV.

101
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You see them sell these at Target all the time, right?

102
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Well, these things are getting smaller and smaller and now check this out.

103
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
They now have key chain plug and plays.

104
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:09,000
A little teeny Atari joystick and a little teeny Atari paddle that you can take with you to play games on the go.

105
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
They have actual games in these.

106
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's an included six foot cable that comes with it.

107
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's on a battery powered reel and you put it on the key chain here.

108
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Then you can plug it in and play.

109
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
There's one joystick that will have Asteroids and Millipede, another with Centipede and Yars Revenge,

110
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
and then the paddle will have Pong, Breakout, and Warlords.

111
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
That's crazy.

112
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The key chain comes with a separate pocket sized reel that holds six feet of cords and RCA jacks.

113
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's powered by three AAA batteries, single player only, however, since it is just a little key chain.

114
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That's crazy.

115
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I wonder what the original Atari programmers think of these.

116
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I know, I've got to wonder.

117
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
That's the next Classic Gaming Expo that they do.

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
They skipped here for Classic Gaming Expo so they could do the 10th anniversary.

119
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Right.

120
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm definitely going and I'm going to ask them what they think of that because that's just crazy.

121
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:06,000
GS68 says, I'm left handed, I demand a lefty stick or I will refuse to buy Atari 2600 related crap.

122
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Dark Tetsuya in our chat says, shame the paddle won't link up with three others.

123
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So, sad.

124
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Okay, well, what we're going to do now, I think that was about all the gaming news we have.

125
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
We'll get some last minute stories in a minute if any folks have stuff.

126
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Well, first, we have these.

127
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I wanted to play these since we are celebrating our 200th episode.

128
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
We got sent a surprise from All Games, our buddies at All Games.

129
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So, I was going to go ahead and play this so we could hear this.

130
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Hey Crop, did you hear the news?

131
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
What news?

132
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Orange Lounge Radio is doing their 200th episode this week.

133
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
What?

134
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Yeah.

135
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Two hundred?

136
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yeah.

137
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Nice dedication for you.

138
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yeah, it is.

139
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Two hundred shows.

140
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Two hundred.

141
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
That's a lot.

142
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yeah?

143
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yeah, it is.

144
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You think you'll ever reach that level of dedication?

145
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Well, my contract is only for thirty.

146
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You have a contract?

147
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Oops.

148
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Hey there, this is Scott from All Games Interactive wishing the guys and girls at Orange Lounge Radio

149
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
a happy 200th episode.

150
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Sky, Dark Sacra, and Loki, you guys kick ass.

151
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
In fact, to celebrate, we are going to spend the next four days playing DDR and listening to DDR music.

152
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So, from everyone here at the Arena Lounge, on 200 episodes, you guys rock.

153
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Do you realize how cool it would be if I could actually play V and have it sound like this?

154
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Oh, anyway, Bobby Blackwolf here from that show that comes on before you guys.

155
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
200, eh?

156
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Y'all cheated, counting all those years of internet radio and all.

157
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But don't worry, Scott's funky episode numbering will catch up in about a month.

158
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
But seriously, y'all were one of the reasons I started podcasting and I enjoy you guys each week.

159
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Good luck to all of you in the future, and make sure it doesn't go downhill from here.

160
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Someone had to say it.

161
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That was wonderful.

162
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That was so cute.

163
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
That was so cute. I don't know what else to say.

164
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Just the thing that had me cracking was, you had a contract?

165
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That was Kopackin and Hendrix from the show Between Us.

166
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You know, who are all those people at Arena yelling in the background there?

167
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That was kind of interesting.

168
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
They hired people.

169
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yeah, they must have hired stand-ins to do that.

170
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Hey Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

171
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
What?

172
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I want my second glass of champagne.

173
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Good for you.

174
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Did you want my glass?

175
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
That was unintentional.

176
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Did you want my glass of champagne? Because I don't want it.

177
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Let me finish this one first.

178
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
That's what I did at your wedding.

179
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
No, that's what I did at your wedding.

180
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Yeah, I want to see if Scott really does play for a day's worth of DDR.

181
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Because, you know, Scott's full of shit sometimes.

182
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I wonder if he's really going to do four days of DDR.

183
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I cannot picture him playing DDR.

184
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But if they do, is Black Boy still listening?

185
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Oh no, I don't think he is.

186
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Somebody videotape it over at Arena Lounge.

187
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
God damn it, that Rob shit in the chat room needs to stop right now.

188
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
They are just flooding our chat.

189
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You haven't done that since like what, episode one?

190
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I think so.

191
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
All right.

192
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Well, All Games, we love those guys.

193
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And thank you guys so much for getting in on that and putting that together for us.

194
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
That was awesome.

195
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Our fans also decided to ambush our voicemail line this week.

196
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I know we have fans.

197
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
That's what I said too.

198
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Well, we had some voicemails hit our voicemail line this week.

199
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So we're going to play that as well.

200
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Hello, Orange Land Radio.

201
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Happy 200th episode.

202
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Thank you.

203
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I love you guys.

204
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You're a lover.

205
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
No, it's not Japanese hard time for it.

206
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Really?

207
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Thank you.

208
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Oh, I heart you.

209
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Let's hit three.

210
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Hi, Orange Land Radio.

211
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
This is Christian Cream.

212
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Congratulations on episode 200.

213
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm with you all the way.

214
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Thanks.

215
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Have a good show.

216
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm going to be looking for my stuff.

217
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yay, Orange Land Radio.

218
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Whoo!

219
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Hello, Sky, Loki, and Dark Sakura.

220
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
This is DMX.

221
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm calling to congratulate you guys on your 200th episode.

222
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I don't know many podcasts at all.

223
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'll be honest.

224
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
But you guys have been around for a while.

225
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I've heard about you for a while.

226
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I just started being a part of the station in a bigger way.

227
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And I love you guys.

228
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Keep up the good work.

229
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Here's to another 200.

230
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You guys all take care.

231
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Let's hit three.

232
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
This is MPV operator 6160 with a message.

233
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Hello, Orange Land Radio.

234
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And congratulations on your 200th episode.

235
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Hope for many more in the future.

236
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Pooh, you're out.

237
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Hey, it's Misty.

238
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And I'm pretty sure that I'm going

239
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
to be listening tonight anyway.

240
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
But I just wanted to say, in a more personal way,

241
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
congrats on reaching episode 200.

242
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Bye.

243
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Wow.

244
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
That was really sweet, you guys.

245
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Thank you very much.

246
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I know.

247
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I like the guy.

248
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I think it was Yuri Lever who sounded like he was talking.

249
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And he had just had this.

250
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Oh, god.

251
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Red versus blue.

252
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Who is that?

253
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Camus.

254
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Camus.

255
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
He sounded like Camus.

256
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I have to go to the bathroom now.

257
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I have the microphone to the phone.

258
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And you tell everybody what you just told me.

259
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Uh-oh.

260
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Dan?

261
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
What?

262
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
What did he say?

263
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Tell us what you just told me.

264
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Are you getting it?

265
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
All right.

266
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
On the count of three.

267
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
One, two, three.

268
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Congratulations.

269
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
We can't hear it.

270
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
We can't hear it.

271
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
What's he saying?

272
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Just tell us what he's saying.

273
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
From everybody here, Pat Bucher.

274
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Do you have speakerphone on that?

275
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
No.

276
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I do have speakerphone.

277
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Oh, yeah.

278
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Put it on speakerphone.

279
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
One second.

280
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
We warned you guys it would be random.

281
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
OK.

282
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Is that it?

283
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Is this your husband?

284
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
This is Dan.

285
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
OK.

286
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Say it again.

287
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Uh, congratulations on your 200th episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

288
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Man, I didn't think you'd make it to, you know, two.

289
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:14,000
We didn't think we'd make it to two either.

290
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Wow.

291
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,520
That was nice.

292
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,520
Everybody's getting in on the love.

293
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,520
You're still on speakerphone.

294
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,520
You're still there.

295
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,520
Close the damn phone.

296
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,520
We've got other stuff to get to.

297
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,520
Don't wait.

298
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,520
Bye, sweetie.

299
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,520
All right.

300
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,520
Dork.

301
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,520
Yes.

302
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,440
I'm saying this on the radio.

303
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:40,640
My husband is a dork, but he brings me pinballs, so that's why I keep them around.

304
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,640
This is great radio.

305
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,640
You know what?

306
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,640
We're all drinking champagne.

307
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,640
What can I say?

308
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,640
This is the second time Dan's been on the show.

309
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,880
This is great champagne.

310
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,360
Any last minute stories tonight?

311
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,360
Loki.

312
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,360
Yes.

313
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,360
Of course, I have stuff.

314
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,840
The first thing I want to talk about is release dates, because, of course, I have stuff.

315
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:02,280
It's all very interesting and always very controversial.

316
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:07,840
This mostly is from Sega, who we've had some problems with in the past about Phantasy Star

317
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:13,620
Universe, but anyways, let's talk about next gen, shall we?

318
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:19,880
Virtual Fighter V for the PlayStation 3 is slated to come out March 15th of next year,

319
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,200
so look forward to that.

320
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:28,240
Also gracing our presence will be Virtual Tennis 3 for both the PlayStation 3, the Xbox

321
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:35,520
360, and the PSP, all those coming out on the 21st of March next year.

322
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:40,800
This one we ran on the site also, and this is probably the first you'll hear of it.

323
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:48,000
Full Auto 2 coming to the PSP March 14th, so it's not just PlayStation 3 anymore.

324
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,560
Very interesting on that.

325
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,800
And then this one, which is very controversial, since there was some news from From Software

326
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,760
that this version might not be coming out.

327
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:06,360
Coming from Sega, Armored Core 4 on both the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360, March 21st.

328
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,480
These dates were just updated in our system on the 11th of September, so this is very

329
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,760
fresh news.

330
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:19,640
Also After Burner for the PSP coming out March 21st as well, so look forward to those wonderful

331
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,640
Sega games March of next year.

332
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:27,200
Alright, I am going to open up the Skype line over at Orangelaunchradio.com, click on interact

333
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:32,920
with us, or you can always call us on the regular telephone as well, it's 916-226-9067.

334
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,320
I imagine the Skype line is going to be very popular tonight, we'll get through as many

335
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,960
calls as we can, we're practically dedicating a whole segment to it, we'll see.

336
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,160
Well, they're already coming in, so let's pick up a call and start going.

337
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,520
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

338
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,520
This is Meg Z.

339
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,520
Hi Meg Z!

340
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,520
Meg Z!

341
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,520
How are you Meg Z?

342
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,520
I am fantastic.

343
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,520
I just went deaf.

344
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,560
From all the girly screaming in here, I think I just went deaf.

345
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,560
What's on your mind?

346
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,560
Wii!

347
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,560
Wii!

348
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,440
Are you excited about the Wii news, or are you just celebrating our 200th episode with

349
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,440
us?

350
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,440
A little bit of both.

351
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,840
Alright, you're definitely going to be getting a Wii?

352
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:11,840
Oh man, the morning after I knew, I had called my GameStop at 9 in the morning to see if

353
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,960
we could do reserves yet, and unfortunately we couldn't, but yes, I will be getting a

354
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,960
Wii.

355
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,960
Alright!

356
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,960
What games do you want to pick up?

357
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:24,160
I would like to stress that I predicted the date.

358
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,160
How did you predict the date?

359
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,160
Did you just pull it out of your butt, or did you make connections?

360
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,160
Here's my reasoning.

361
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,160
Here's my reasoning.

362
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:34,280
Okay, so if you guys with decent memories remember, the GameCube launched shortly after

363
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:39,640
the Xbox did, and it did phenomenally that holiday season.

364
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:44,920
And the PS3 launches on a Friday, the 17th of Friday, and I know Nintendo likes to launch

365
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,440
their systems on Sundays, so I said, hey, Sunday the 19th, that could be their release

366
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,440
date.

367
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,440
That's my prediction.

368
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,600
And then not three hours later, the information got leaked that it was going to be released

369
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,040
on that Sunday.

370
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:05,320
I'm sitting here looking at a text message on my phone that says November 19th from Megzi.

371
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,920
Well good job on that, making an educated guess to do it.

372
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,560
So your internet penis grew by two inches for that.

373
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,560
Congratulations.

374
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,040
I've also got a funny story.

375
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,960
Yeah, the funny story.

376
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:22,920
Okay, so lately I've been trying to catch up on games that I might have missed.

377
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,640
They came out and they were great, but for some reason I didn't pick them up.

378
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,280
So the other day I picked up Metroid Prime, right?

379
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,160
Because I never got a chance to play it and I wanted to try it out.

380
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,960
So after I got off of work, I called Chris and-

381
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,200
Chris is looking angry at this story already.

382
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,200
Oh, she's flipping you off.

383
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,200
All right, let's hear it.

384
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,600
So I called up Chris and I was like, so this is what I did during my day.

385
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:52,400
And I picked up Metroid Prime and she says, oh, is that the one with the monkey?

386
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,640
Aw, poor Chris.

387
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,240
We love you, Chris.

388
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,040
And so we decided we're going to make a game called Metroid Primate.

389
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,320
I thought it was a different game.

390
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,640
I did not claim to be an expert on video games.

391
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,560
I know, but Metroid and a monkey, what was your-

392
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,720
I'm going to prove to you.

393
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,720
I thought it was a different game.

394
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,120
That's why you thought it was like Dungeon Siege or something.

395
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,120
No, I didn't.

396
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,120
I thought it was an RP.

397
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,640
Megsy, it's Dungeon Zoo.

398
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,640
Shut up.

399
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,640
Dungeon Zoo.

400
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:26,720
I'm still going- Megsy, we need to like start doing pictures of Metroid Primates.

401
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,720
Hells yeah.

402
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,720
All right.

403
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,720
Me.

404
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,720
Me.

405
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,720
Me.

406
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,720
Me.

407
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,720
Heart.

408
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,720
Heart, we love you, Chris.

409
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,720
You hear this?

410
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,720
She's invited the biteage.

411
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,720
I do want to point out though, Wonder Dog Harold in our chat room says Samus with a

412
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,800
pet monkey would be the best.

413
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,280
I bet she'd- We love you, Chris.

414
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,600
You bring us- Speaking of pets, you heard this week that

415
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,680
they announced Seaman 2 for the PlayStation 2 coming out.

416
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,680
Tee hee.

417
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,680
What?

418
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,680
Tee hee.

419
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,680
All right.

420
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,280
Megsy, we got to take some more calls because everybody's trying to get in tonight, but

421
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,280
any last words?

422
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,000
Oh, Reggie, you're so fine.

423
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You're so fine.

424
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You blew my mind.

425
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Hey, Reggie.

426
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Hey.

427
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
All right.

428
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Hey, Reggie.

429
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Reggie fan.

430
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm sorry.

431
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
All right.

432
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Aw, Chris is pouting.

433
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You want to say anything to Megsy, Chris?

434
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I love you.

435
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I hate you.

436
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I love you too.

437
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I hate you so much.

438
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,280
Hey, Chris.

439
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,280
You know what that- Megsy.

440
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,280
Megsy.

441
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,280
Megsy, you know what that means though?

442
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,280
You know what that means though?

443
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,280
What?

444
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,280
Makeup sex.

445
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,280
Ooh.

446
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,280
All right.

447
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,280
See you later.

448
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,280
See ya.

449
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,280
Bye.

450
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,280
I thought you were making a trip to Wisconsin pretty soon, Chris.

451
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,280
I know.

452
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,280
I'm going next weekend.

453
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,500
And there's going to be lots of makeup sex.

454
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,500
Lots and lots of makeup sex.

455
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,500
Hi.

456
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,500
You're on Orange.

457
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,500
Whoa.

458
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,500
We're getting feedback.

459
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,500
Hi.

460
00:19:42,500 --> 00:20:12,480
Hi, this is Bob Coffee from the chat room.

461
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:38,200
We are on Purple and we are on Yellow and we are on Yellow and

462
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,120
we are on Yellow and

463
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:47,320
comment I'd like to make and sorry about the

464
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,080
shitty first call. That's alright, no no, you got a bad hum so that's alright

465
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,320
you'll be able to hear it and

466
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,600
try to figure out what the problem is. I gotta let you go though buddy. Thanks so much for the call

467
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,880
we like hearing from new people

468
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,120
interesting thought that Nintendo 64 was going to be $249 when it first came out

469
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,480
and then they cut the price last minute could that happen again

470
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,000
I think the pack-in game kinda breaks this deal here I think with Wii Sports

471
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,720
being in there I think $250 is kinda set in stone

472
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,920
I don't see it getting cut at the last minute but who knows anything's possible right

473
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,080
right? I think it all comes down to their feedback

474
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,760
they get from people. Alright let's go to another call. Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

475
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,840
Greetings my brother and sister in

476
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,840
this is Mel B actually. Hi Mel!

477
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,080
Wow, Mel you were here forever ago. You've known of Orange Launch Radio since

478
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,720
episode like six

479
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:39,400
Pretty much. Wow. I've seen you in like what maybe three different studios already

480
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,560
Yeah we've been to a lot of different places we've gotten evicted from a lot of places

481
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:48,480
What's on your mind buddy? Oh well you know it's 200 you know I had to weigh in you know

482
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,680
say congratulations to you guys. Appreciate it

483
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,840
you know it's just I'm just really proud of how you guys have grown by

484
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,160
within this 194 episodes I guess since I first seen you

485
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,400
I mean I can remember back in the day when you know it's like

486
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,760
you guys would have to be scrapping to get contact left and right

487
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,800
like you know I'd be trying to hook you up with this and now you guys are like making a name on

488
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,720
your own and it's like you know I can just fade in the background and

489
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:18,400
I mean you guys have just been darn good ever since. Well we appreciate you you know taking a

490
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,280
chance on the show when it was such a little deal you know you were a big name

491
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,640
in the DDR scene for freestyle and everything well still are too just

492
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,680
you know DDR in general

493
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,960
you know you haven't had a lot of tournaments lately but you know you came on our show

494
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,160
kinda early on

495
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,680
and a lot of people recognize you from freestyle so that's great

496
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:37,280
and you know it kind of enabled us to be all friends and stuff after that so

497
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:43,000
really it was kind of good to have Mr. DDR on there. Yeah guys actually both kind of like cutting one of those first radio promos for you back then.

498
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,120
Yeah it was awesome. So what do you think of the DDR scene now versus four years ago when the show

499
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:47,600
started?

500
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,920
I think I mean a lot of it

501
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,560
kinda I mean it's been a major shift whereas before there was sort of like a

502
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:59,160
kinda like a 60-40 split where freestyle was bringing in a lot of casual

503
00:22:59,160 --> 00:22:59,880
people in

504
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,760
but now it's become such a technical sport now with Perfect Attack and White Hot

505
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,040
it's pretty much a standard now. Freestyle is sort of like

506
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,040
I think people just aren't pushing each other nowadays to be better

507
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,520
they're just kinda like waiting for some tournament to come around they're just doing

508
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,480
something good enough to win so there really just isn't that progress for quite yet

509
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,760
and I don't see one up because Supernova's got so many darn songs that you know

510
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,000
people were begging for but you know what can you do I mean

511
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'm sure I'm gonna break out some more routine sooner or later but you know until then

512
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,160
I guess I'll just be laying in the cut. Is In the Groove partially to blame for

513
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,120
freestyle

514
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,240
going down and PA going up?

515
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,440
Well I mean there just wasn't that much to do in the group for freestyle but I think

516
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:43,920
kind of

517
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,960
I think with freestyle it was just sort of like to the point where

518
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,280
I think I mean just kinda looking back now just in retrospect

519
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,560
I think a good freestyle sort of has a very short

520
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,920
life span I guess if you could say it's sort of like

521
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:02,000
you're hot for a good six months or a year but then afterwards it's like judges

522
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,120
you know get tired of your act and you know they want to see something new but

523
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,560
no one new has really stepped up since like 2003, 2004

524
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:13,520
So well I hope Supernova can just turn some of that around I guess we'll see huh?

525
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,320
I'm pretty sure I mean I do know some people that are still hungry and waiting for their

526
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,240
big chance to you know break out on the team that I think

527
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,840
it's gotta be the onus is on a lot of people who are big into

528
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,440
freestyle community that still have name value to put together events even

529
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,200
doesn't even have to be like a tournament for a thousand bucks whatever you just could

530
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,600
get good get-togethers you know just videotape it and you know just get the

531
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,240
word around by you know whatever

532
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,800
YouTube will get people back into Spain

533
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,160
well it'll be very interesting to see what happens you know in the future and

534
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,520
everything and I know OLR wants to do some type of DDR tournament we've got

535
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,720
some ideas so we'll see what happens in the future

536
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,560
you can definitely count on me to give you a hand with that one

537

thanks for calling in bye bye

564
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,040
alright let's go to another call here I'll go to this one

565
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:34,400
hi you're on Orange Lawn's radio who's this? hey it's Little Rain again hi what's on your mind Little Rain?

566
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,520
two things yep first

567
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:42,440
congratulations on having 200 episodes thank you very much

568
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,880
appreciate it I have out a few friends with their podcast and

569
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,680
trying to get first live radio and then podcast

570
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,080
it's amazing that you guys have made it this far

571
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:57,560
it's a big fan mark we're amazed too that we've lasted this long it's something else

572
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,840
I think probably it's crossed all three of our minds at one point or another

573
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,080
that we wanted to quit

574
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,320
but there's something that always brings us back to doing this

575
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:09,880
I'll never do that I'll admit there was there was one week where it was pretty bad I was

576
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,520
having a really emo week and I was about ready to come on here and go I quit

577
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:17,480
but you know in the end it's really you know it's about you guys and about you

578
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,160
know of course Loki and Dark Sakura

579
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,280
just getting to hang out with them every week and everything and while we may

580
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,800
have our ups and downs sometimes you know it all comes back to games here at

581
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,560
Orange Lawn's radio so it's it's good

582
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,880
it's the it's the great equalizer

583
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,640
and second thing was I saw the Nintendo Wii press conference

584
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,040
well what did you think?

585
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,640
well yay that it's coming out so early I was

586
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,840
half thinking it was going to be delayed but you know they

587
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,120
they actually kept it and they also were talking about

588
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,160
how you can put like videos on the memory card

589
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,640
and play them back

590
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,720
now do you think with codecs and all that do you think

591
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,800
everything's going to work universal or you could just download something

592
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:06,280
or pay 20 Wii points and get the newest codec that works with everything?

593
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:10,000
Do you have a thought, Loki?

594
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
You know what they're running as far as graphics

595
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,680
you know a graphics card in there. Would it be licensing with the codecs too

596
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:20,160
could come into play? Some codecs are free but yeah I mean

597
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:24,080
this is whatever they want to do I mean it I'm sure it's going to support like

598
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,880
MPEG-2 and stuff like that because

599
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,760
I mean they were basically kind of thinking can you take your camcorder and you

600
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,160
plug in your SD memory card from that into there and you get to watch videos

601
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:38,040
alright well you going to be picking up a Wii?

602
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,400
Oh yes. Alright.

603
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,720
I'm going to be picking up the PS3. You are going to get a PS3.

604
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,200
I told you I had to. Oh that's right that's right because you had to buy the one for your friend

605
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,800
because of the bet and everything. Alright well

606
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:54,040
you're not going to buy one for yourself? Well the Wii for myself, yes.

607
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,960
The PS3, hell no. Why not? Why no PS3 for yourself?

608
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:02,800
There's nothing at launch that really drives me to get it.

609
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,440
Sony's gonna have to sell it really really sell it at Tokyo Game Show to show

610
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,600
us why we need one at launch

611
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,200
should be interesting. Alright. Thanks.

612
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,400
No problem. Hey we gotta let you go buddy because we got more calls coming in but thanks so

613
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,360
much for calling in tonight.

614
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,240
Alright later. Lots and lots of calls tonight. We really appreciate it.

615
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:23,200
Let's go to another call. Oh my gosh we're getting so many calls tonight. Hi you're on Orange

616
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,400
Falls Radio. Who's this?

617
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,920
Raven's Dolphin. Hi Raven's Dolphin. What's on your mind buddy?

618
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:32,080
Sorry I'm on my cell phone but this is Skype's working.

619
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,400
That's alright you know we're getting hammered left and right tonight. What's on your mind?

620
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,800
I got a hairline

621
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,040
fracture on my DS. How'd that happen?

622
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,120
I don't know and I replaced it

623
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,720
and BB charged me 50 bucks for it. Ouch!

624
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,840
You didn't have one of those replacement policy things or whatever? No I had it.

625
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,960
But you'll trade it in and you'll get a black one.

626
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:01,120
Oh huh interesting. Was this a DS Lite that cracked or a DS Fat?

627
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,200
Oh it was a Lite and I was pissed.

628
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,480
Wow yeah I got a lot of problems with that. But didn't Nintendo do some type of

629
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,760
replacement system or was that just the UK? I don't remember. It's been so long now.

630
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,840
They charged you 50 bucks to replace it?

631
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,280
Was it your fault?

632
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,640
Here's the thing. They replaced it but

633
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,320
it would only be a white one. It wouldn't be a free black one which pissed me off.

634
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:31,920
Oh I see. Did you have a black one or did you have a white one and you wanted to get a black one?

635
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:36,880
I had a white one and I wanted to get a black one. Ah well that's why they charged you for it.

636
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,480
God it's just a stinking color though but I guess you know maybe there's more

637
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,680
demand for the black ones right now or something I don't know.

638
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:47,880
Why would you want a black one? It wouldn't match your Wii. Well everyone wanted a black one.

639
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:53,520
Didn't you say you wanted a pink one? I want a pink one! I almost bought one at Walmart but I'm poor.

640
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:58,080
Because we don't make money off OLR. But some day.

641
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:03,880
Anything else on your mind Raven's Dolphins? We have to get some more calls.

642
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,520
Oh sure. There's one more thing on my mind.

643
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,520
It's they're doing the right thing with it.

644
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:15,400
How so?

645
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,560
Because how the name is and how they're setting it up

646
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:22,320
they're really putting Sony in jeopardy this time.

647
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,520
We'll all see after the Christmas season when the numbers come out. I think you might be right though.

648
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,840
Alright I'm definitely trying to get a Wii.

649
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,400
I'm going to stand in the freezing cold on a Walmart

650
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:38,000
or at EB. I'm paying someone to get it. Just let's hope that whole little

651
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,840
thing about what they're supposedly doing in Hawaii with the whole fifty

652
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,120
dollars to reserve

653
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,720
or fifty dollars in trade-ins to reserve it doesn't catch on nationwide because

654
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,600
that's kinda poopy.

655
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:51,280
So we'll see. Alright guys so I'm gonna cut it short and go.

656
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:55,200
Alright. It's all good buddy. Have a good one.

657
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,640
Alright. Lay it up. Wow we're just getting

658
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,680
more and more calls. We'll just keep it going. Why not? We have a whole nother

659
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,920
section to show here tonight. Let's go to another call. Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio.

660
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,400
Who's this?

661
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,720
It's me Ron. What's up fellas? Hey how you doing? Hey wait a minute. I'm doing good.

662
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:14,640
I do not believe the lady sitting behind me is a fella. Ron, how could you forget?

663
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,440
I splashed you with stupid stuff from China. What can I tell you?

664
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,560
I am not cursed. Alright. What's on your mind, Rama? Not much. A few things. I finally saw a

665
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,080
Dance Revolution yesterday and it wasn't that bad.

666
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:31,240
Really? I heard it was a vomit in my mouth. You know what's interesting?

667
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,240
The show is not being carried in Sacramento so we couldn't see it.

668
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,560
Yeah. It's not on a CBS out there? No it's not on a CBS.

669
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:43,520
I looked at the preview guide and there was not anything there. So kudos to KOVR 13.

670
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,800
Good job guys. No crap on that network. Good job.

671
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:52,040
Does Viacom own them? I don't know but I heard there was no like actual DDR

672
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,400
stuff on the show. There wasn't.

673
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:59,400
It's the same font and that's about it. It's basically Dance Fever with little

674
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:03,880
kids and it's a contest and the grand prize is a $25,000 scholarship from Konami.

675
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:08,480
Okay so why was that not shitty? I don't know because I thought it wasn't so bad.

676
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,400
It broke the mold. Everybody was thinking it was going to be DDR this, DDR that, you know?

677
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,200
Are you a twelve-year-old girl?

678
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,680
No. Okay. Do you think twelve-year-old girls will like the show?

679
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:24,640
I have no idea. Bandit in our chat room says,

680
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,040
fuck Dance Fever. Fuck you too. Alright.

681
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:32,220
Anything else on your mind buddy? I wanted to say some other things

682
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,360
but I have here in my hands a 22 ounce

683
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,040
ounce of Guinness and I'm about to open it up and I'm having a toast here for you guys.

684
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:43,680
I appreciate that. A toast to you? Yeah. Here's to you,

685
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,280
here's to me, the best of friends we will be. But if we should ever happen to agree,

686
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:47,680
well

687
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:51,000
fuck you and here's to me. I'm down on this bitch right now.

688
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,080
Enjoy that Guinness motherfucker. I'll see you in October.

689
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,080
Got that shit right. Later.

690
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,000
Let's go to one of our old favorites. I've been making the poor bastard wait all night.

691
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,280
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this? One and only Legend of Zaku.

692
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:10,640
What's on your mind Mr. Zaku? Well, just, you know,

693
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:14,720
200 episodes man. That's a feat right there that you can't

694
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,840
accomplish without effort. It wouldn't be a 200th episode without our

695
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:22,080
200 minutes worth of phone calls caller here, Zaku.

696
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,040
Yes. Digital life's coming up. You excited? You going to go see Final Fantasy XII?

697
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:31,680
Yeah, that and I'm trying to pick out a freestyle routine. I'm trying to pick out a song most importantly.

698
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,880
I kind of have a case of Freestyler's Block at the moment.

699
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,280
Alright, you going to come visit me in October because I'm coming to New York?

700
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,560
Yeah, most definitely. I'll even give you the stuff that I'm a

701
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:45,400
snag from Digital Life. You going to get us another signed poster? Because that was pretty bad ass.

702
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:50,040
He got us this signed poster. That depends if Rocks or Red Octane has something set up.

703
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,400
We'll take anything. We like free things. Oh, alright then.

704
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:57,840
You know Supernova's Patch came out last week, right?

705
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,400
That's right. We have a patch and there's a new song in it, right? Some type of remix?

706
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,520
Fascination Eternal Love Remix. Should be fun.

707
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,720
It basically is a

708
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,880
remix of Fascination Max

709
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:17,240
but with the sounds that you get from opening a door in the car.

710
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:22,760
The little ringing sound and just a lot of phone ringing right there.

711
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,520
I think you have the video up there on your site.

712
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,000
Okay.

713
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Anyways, the last thing. I don't get how Nintendo flip flops on what they say.

714
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,360
On one side they said they were going to be reaching free but on the other

715
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:42,080
they act as if they didn't exist. They end up denying it.

716
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:45,680
Someone hasn't made a final decision on it. Management can't.

717
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,880
The left hand's not talking to the right hand. That's exactly what's going on.

718
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,960
Happens in corporate America all the time.

719
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:56,780
I was pretty excited on Thursday when I heard all these wonderful fairy tales

720
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,720
about the Wii.

721
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,440
Then all of a sudden we have this little black eye

722
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,000
that came days later.

723
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,800
Was the news the end of the world though, Zaku?

724
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,760
I mean, you know what? Screw the Wii and PS3.

725
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,080
It's all about Happy Sky CS. That's it.

726
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,820
I'm focusing all my energy on something besides the hype.

727
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:23,480
Beatmania is the only game you need, huh?

728
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,880
Sounds fair. We got to let you go, Zaku. We got more calls.

729
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,320
Peace.

730
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:36,400
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

731
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,640
Hi, it's Arcadian42.

732
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,640
What's on your mind?

733
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,480
I had to call in because I haven't listened in a while. I had a connection from the first show

734
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,720
since I think I was there. You were there on the first show and this is the

735
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,400
most we've ever heard from you

736
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,880
in like 200 episodes worth of shows.

737
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,240
No, I know. We appreciate your support over the years, Arcadian42.

738
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,960
It's been less recently since I've been playing

739
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,640
too many video games lately. What do you think of the Wii?

740
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:11,320
It looks like it will be interesting. I haven't really been following the news,

741
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:16,040
but since I might have money soon, I might actually be able to buy one.

742
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,080
Awesome. Is that the system of choice

743
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,880
amongst the three? I don't know. I'll have to see what I want.

744
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,520
Alright, sounds good. Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

745
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:32,000
Not really. Just congratulations on your 200 episodes.

746
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,200
Maybe I'll see you and come to a future show.

747
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,480
Yeah, anytime. The door's open to you anytime.

748
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,320
That's awesome. Thank you so much. It really means a lot to us that we have

749
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,920
folks that remember us all the way from episode one still calling in.

750
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,040
I know you've been a longtime supporter of the show. We really appreciate it, my friend.

751
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,520
Alright. Alright, have a good one, buddy. You too. Later.

752
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:55,160
Lots and lots of good news. Let's do at least one more call here. Hi, you're on Orange Lomps Radio.

753
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:55,800
Who's this?

754
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,760
AJ Twist. Hi, what's on your mind?

755
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,880
Just calling in to say happy 200th birthday.

756
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,800
Thank you.

757
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,880
Yeah, that's it. Seeing how you guys are.

758
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,200
Basically, I want to talk to Dark Sakura about Tekken DR.

759
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,640
Okay. Dark Sakura?

760
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,400
Yes. How are you liking the game?

761
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:24,600
I have to say that I like it a whole lot because I'm just such an uber Tekken fan girl

762
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,040
that

763
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,960
it's all about. Though, I always play with Jin every time.

764
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,560
But it's really fun. I like that you have so many different characters to choose from.

765
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,360
It's pretty cool.

766
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,880
I don't know if you remember my letter I wrote in.

767
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,320
Two, three, four months ago, maybe? Oh, it was the Pink Yoshi?

768
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:48,000
I think... I seem to recall a handle named Pink Yoshi because I'm sure I would have made

769
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,520
fun of it.

770
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:52,560
Yeah, yeah, you did. I see.

771
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,760
Nothing personal, my friend.

772
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:01,760
No, it's all good. But yeah, I'm still up for some good matches with you, Dark Sakura, and Tekken.

773
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,920
Some day? Some time?

774
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,680
Some time. Right now it's been kind of crazy busy, but I'm

775
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:12,160
working on trying to set some time aside. If I can ever wrestle the

776
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:16,480
PSP away from Dan, except he's been... I'll have to take it when he's distracted with

777
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,000
pinball.

778
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,280
You guys will have to set up some time on the Orange House Radio message forums.

779
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,720
Yeah, send me a message on the forums and we'll see about setting something up.

780
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,760
Are you aware of the ghost system?

781
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:30,400
I'm sorry? Are you aware of the ghost system? No, actually.

782
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,920
If you play through the dojo,

783
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,280
eventually you can unlock the ghost system, which records your character as you play

784
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,720
and act as your ghost, and you can play that.

785
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,080
Other players can play that online. Oh, that's pretty cool. That's kind of neat.

786
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,600
I'll have to do that, then. Once you get that ghost,

787
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:52,080
maybe you can somehow rip it out of the PSP and

788
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:57,960
online, send it over to me and I'll send you my ghost. Wow, that's kind of neat. I wish they did that for Mario Kart.

789
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,640
I'll have to set some time aside.

790
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:05,400
Check out Tekken if I may plug in the site. Is that alright?

791
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,800
Yeah, I'm going to miss that. Tekken what? Tekken Zaibatsu.

792
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,440
Oh, the Tekken Zaibatsu? Yeah, they have a

793
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,920
little forum on that, too. Oh yeah, I used to go to that site all the time

794
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,800
to get all the pictures and everything from the official Namco art.

795
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:24,400
I haven't been to that. I actually haven't been to that site in easily a year. I forgot about it.

796
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,960
But no, I... Yeah, it hasn't been too big lately.

797
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,160
Not much going on. No, that's a cool site. I'll have to check out the forum.

798
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,080
Thanks. Alright, any other thoughts?

799
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,120
Yeah, oh, Logi. Huh?

800
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,600
A question about the PSP on hacking it.

801
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:44,640
Since you're big on that. What now? A question on the PSP hacking.

802
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:50,000
Yeah. Do you know any cool type of media players that can play playlists?

803
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,200
Hmm, that can play playlists.

804
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,920
I know they had some stuff where you can stream

805
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,120
playlists from your PC.

806
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:04,600
Yeah, I know that one, too. What's the website you always use? PSP updates or something?

807
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,080
PSP updates has a lot of stuff on there. Check it out. Yeah, I'll go check around there more.

808
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:13,000
Alright. Alright, thanks anyways. Well, we gotta let you go, my friend. We got some more calls to

809
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,360
get through, and then we're gonna end the show.

810
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,600
Yeah, happy 200th episode again, and have a good night.

811
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:22,320
Alright. Have a good one, buddy. Bye-bye.

812
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:26,120
Alright, we at least... This number's been trying to hammer us for a little bit now.

813
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,160
Alright. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio. Who's this?

814
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,160
I made it!

815
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,400
Hi, whoa, hi. Who's this?

816
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,360
This is DT.

817
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,040
Huh? Oh, DT, what's on your mind?

818
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,800
Oh, I've been trying to call in for...

819
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:42,120
ever since the segment opened. I know we've been hammered tonight. It's crazy. What's on

820
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,720
your mind, my friend?

821
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,720
Well, I just wanted to wish you guys a happy 200th.

822
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:51,080
Appreciate it. You've been with us since, like, episode one, right?

823
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:54,120
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

824
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:58,640
Well, what do you think about the Wii News? Are you gonna be picking up a Wii?

825
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,520
I'll probably get one for Christmas.

826
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,840
What games in particular are you looking forward to?

827
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,280
Uh, hmm, well...

828
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,560
Red Steel looks kinda cool.

829
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,200
Not Smash Bros. Brawl? Although, I know that's not Smash Bros. Brawl.

830
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,200
Oh, yeah.

831
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,120
You're pumped up for that, right?

832
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,520
Oh, yeah.

833
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,200
So, actually, speaking of Smash Bros. Brawl, are there any other characters that you wanted

834
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,760
to see in it, either Konami or Nintendo?

835
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,880
Well, I was kinda hoping Lolo and Lala would be in it.

836
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,520
Oh, wow.

837
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,640
Lolo and Lala.

838
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,600
Oh, my God, that is old school.

839
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,880
What would they do, turn...

840
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:42,040
They would turn your character into eggs and then push boxes at you.

841
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,040
There you go.

842
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,040
Way old school.

843
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,040
That's pretty cool.

844
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:51,840
Well, DT, I know you've been supporting us since episode one. We really, really appreciate

845
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:55,360
it. Your enthusiasm for this station has been wonderful, and I know you work for our site

846
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,880
now, and we love having you on board. Thanks so much for calling in.

847
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,880
Anytime.

848
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,880
All right, have a good one, my friend.

849
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,880
I'll get you.

850
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,040
Bye-bye. We'll have to play DDR together someday.

851
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,040
I'll have to throw down with him sometime.

852
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:07,440
I haven't seen him in a while. He's local. We, like, never see each other. It's crazy.

853
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,040
DT, do I have to tell you? He, like, lives just around the corner practically. We never

854
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,600
see him. It's kind of sad.

855
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,600
All right.

856
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,600
I see him at Dan's store.

857
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,600
Oh.

858
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,600
I randomly run into him at Dan's GameStop.

859
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:22,000
Oh, snap. Well, thank you guys so much for calling. Oh, we've got one more. We'll make

860
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
this real quick.

861
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,160
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

862
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,160
Uh, ActDeft.

863
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:30,240
Oh, yes. What's on your mind, ActDeft? Gotta be quick.

864
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,240
I'm calling from Mexico.

865
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,240
Oh.

866
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,760
Can I ask you to mail to me, too, for your 200th sale?

867
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,760
Thank you.

868
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,240
What's on your mind?

869
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,360
We are going to rock you.

870
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:46,760
I agree. The we is going to be awesome. Well, thank you so much for calling in. We've got

871
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,040
to keep it short, though, because we've got to get to our next segment. But that's awesome

872
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,680
to hear from people outside of the U.S. once in a while. We love hearing from Canada, Mexico,

873
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,680
U.K. We love it.

874
00:43:53,680 --> 00:44:00,760
Is he still there? Hello? There must be a delay. I think he hung up. Oh, well.

875
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,760
Oh.

876
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,760
Oh, well. Well, thank you. We appreciate it.

877
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,760
Thanks for calling.

878
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,400
I know. I think that's the first call from Mexico we've gotten.

879
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,400
I think so.

880
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,400
How sweet.

881
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,400
Cool. Thank you.

882
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,400
Bye.

883
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,400
Bye.

884
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,400
I'm going to go to Cabo someday. I've never been to Mexico, but I want to go to Cabo.

885
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,400
I'm going to go to Tijuana.

886
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:19,400
All right. We're going to do this now. I warned you this would be a little bit random. We're

887
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:24,280
going to bring back a segment that you guys who listen to the old show know. And those

888
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,260
of you guys who joined us in the podcast, maybe you've never heard this segment before.

889
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:32,380
But it's been known to get a little bit weird and a little bit random and a little bit questiony.

890
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:35,320
It's this old segment called Ask Orange Lounge.

891
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:46,540
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question. Well, will we find out this week on Orange

892
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:52,800
Lounge Radio? I'm sure it's going to be interesting because we haven't allowed this segment on

893
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:59,120
in over a year because the questions have been lame.

894
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:07,080
So let's see what you guys have pent up over the past year. DMN wants to know, what's the

895
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:11,760
most fun thing and the most frustrating thing about doing Orange Lounge Radio?

896
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:19,840
The most fun thing is having my ego grow. And the most frustrating thing is this room

897
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:31,360
with the door shut. It does get quite hot in here. I don't know.

898
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:35,560
Just trying to stay on top of the news is kind of tough during the week. Remembering

899
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:41,400
to update my show rules. I would say the most fun thing about Orange

900
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:46,360
Lounge Radio. Oh, it's so much fun. No, but it's getting that instant feedback of having

901
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:50,520
people like whether it be Dark Soccer or Loki like right here in my ear or having the chat

902
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:53,400
room there. I think having that feedback on your opinions

903
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,100
is really great and kind of neat. I don't know. It's just like the reward I get from

904
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:00,680
it is instant gratification. You know I'm a typical male.

905
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:04,900
The most frustrating thing about doing Orange Lounge Radio is losing my Sunday nights. As

906
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:08,120
much as I enjoy hanging out, but it's tough because it means you only really get a one

907
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:11,960
day weekend. So that's been frustrating. But I don't know. I guess you're just used to

908
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:14,760
it after 200 weeks now, right? That's how I feel.

909
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:19,400
You're just kind of used to it. I have fully timed it. How long do I have to

910
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:25,600
leave the South Bay now to get here? Guys, since we have about at least 20 people

911
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:29,640
who submitted questions tonight, we can't get all your questions in, so we apologize.

912
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,840
The things that are a little too random and weird, we may not be able to get to tonight.

913
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:37,000
I apologize. OL Army Eddie wants to know, where can I get

914
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:42,320
all these cool songs you play? The internet. The internet is not just for

915
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:49,840
iTunes. If you ever want to know, try asking in chat. Try emailing one of us. The thing

916
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:54,040
is that when you guys ask during the show, sometimes we're so busy like operating the

917
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:57,440
behind the scenes stuff that we can't answer questions right away. But if you can like

918
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,440
hum a few bars, we'll tell you. You can always send us an email. I'm more than fine with

919
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,760
sharing song titles. Send me an email.

920
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:10,480
Also he wants to know, I guess I'll go ahead and entertain this question. What would cause

921
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:18,480
Sky to go straight? Be graphic if needed. Oh, Chris. What was that Chris? That might

922
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:26,160
be a good start. I would say One Hot Night with Gina Gershon or Beyonce. I don't know

923
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:34,440
why I love Beyonce. She's so hot. She's really hot. No, I don't know. Honestly, boobs and

924
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:40,520
poon anner just don't do it for me. I'm sorry. I'm sure you appreciate the aesthetic value

925
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:43,400
of boobs. I asked the women out there, do boobs and

926
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:49,200
poon anner do it for you? Well, I know this is probably not the best room to ask this

927
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:53,120
question in, but I'm asking the other women out there. That's how I feel. And guys out

928
00:47:53,120 --> 00:48:01,680
there, if you're a straight man, does penis do it for you? That's how I feel about boobs

929
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:07,440
and poon anner. Are you gay? If you scream phone call, you're gay.

930
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:17,940
Act Deaf wants to know, can you speak Spanish? Uno pequeño de Español, si. I had two years

931
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:23,920
of Spanish or dos años de Español in Colegio, but I'm not very good at it. I only remember

932
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:29,080
a few words here and there. El telefono es en fuego.

933
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:33,080
I would like to learn more. I took French and Japanese, so I can also

934
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:38,060
say that the TV is on fire. Act Deaf also wants to know, what's your opinion

935
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:41,320
on Mexican zoning? Pump it up. What's wrong with that?

936
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,880
Nothing wrong with that. That's pretty hot.

937
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:48,640
More games for everyone. That's a good thing. No problems there. Unless the country actually

938
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:56,120
bought the game. I don't know. Black Wolf says, how can you type with boxing

939
00:48:56,120 --> 00:49:03,040
gloves on your hands? What? A very large keyboard.

940
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:09,540
Use your toes. Lo cuisintes cléverdan. God damn you people that bring Homestar Runner

941
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:13,440
into this show. No, I love Homestar Runner. I can't complain,

942
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:20,000
but you guys are funny. Check on the PMs, check on the PMs.

943
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,520
E-mail. Dark Tetsuya wants to know, so what's it like

944
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:26,800
going from reporting on hypodermic needles in Solo 2000 to the Nintendo Wii?

945
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,000
Nostalgia. Wow, nostalgia. That was one of our first

946
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,200
big topics. I remember calling that arcade.

947
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:37,640
I said, oh, you'll have to talk to our manager. I remember that too. We were pretty cutting

948
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,600
out. That was when I was sleeping in the Harry Potter

949
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:43,400
room in the gay frat house. That was awesome.

950
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,600
Wow. Yeah, we were. I remember doing the recording

951
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:54,120
a podcast. No, not even a podcast. We were recording a live show while I was playing

952
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:57,960
BeatMania and they were trying to talk to me like, I'm trying to play 3, 2, 1 stars,

953
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:02,720
dammit. You know, it's just been crazy. There's been

954
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:06,880
a lot of, it's funny how games have changed in the past four years because when we started

955
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,400
doing this show, Max 2 was new in the arcades and then we went through Extreme, we went

956
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:16,160
through a drought, now we're into Supernova. All right, more songs. We want to get out

957
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:20,480
of here before midnight tonight. GS68 wants to know, do any of you play O2Jam?

958
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,760
I tried it out about six months ago and I had a pretty good time with it. I just haven't

959
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:32,800
been back. I don't do well with the games. I don't know. I'm not good at checking in

960
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:37,120
regularly with games like that for some reason. I did play recently a game that somewhat reminded

961
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:41,040
me of it though, which was the R2B, which was kind of fun. I should check it out again

962
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:45,040
and see what's changed there. Has anyone else played O2Jam? No? Yes? No?

963
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:53,720
I looked at it at E3 and then walked on. All right. Let's see. NintendoManiac64 wants

964
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:58,680
to know, could I race Loki at Mario Kart DS? I never got the chance and I've gone anti-snaking

965
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:03,560
since nine months ago. That sounds like a 12-step program.

966
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:10,680
I literally dusted off Mario Kart DS today. I haven't played that game in months.

967
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:17,300
All right. Bandit wants to know, if train A is traveling at 50 miles per hour from Pittsburgh

968
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:21,520
and train B is traveling at 35 miles per hour from California, which state will they meet

969
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,800
in order to resupply the Orange Lawns radio with more Chocobo Nuggets?

970
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:29,480
Wisconsin! Wisconsin! African or European?

971
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:34,720
Africa! NazgulSlayer wants to know, question, is there

972
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,640
a Castro district ghetto? Yes!

973
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:43,760
How about the whole place is ghetto? I actually feel safer there than just about

974
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,880
any other places in San Francisco. Yeah, actually if you go around San Francisco

975
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,760
it's the safest place I feel. Except for the homeless man who was laying

976
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:52,520
with his cock out. Around for your birthday we found something

977
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:57,760
in the window and it's about like that big around and it's a penis and we're going

978
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,680
to get you for your birthday. I'm going to chase you around the house with

979
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:05,920
it. We also found you a codless body suit.

980
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:11,160
That's disgusting. Rama wants to know, you need to talk about

981
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:15,520
the Spanish DDR movie? Yeah, that's right. I watched the trailer

982
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,120
for that. La machina de ballar.

983
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,960
It actually looks kind of funny. I want to see the actual movie before I talk

984
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,340
about it. You know, trailers can be deceiving, right?

985
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,120
The trailer looked funny. All right.

986
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:28,640
Poto wants to know, dear Orange Lawns radio, if you had to be a species of bird, extinct

987
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,440
or not, which would you be? Dodo.

988
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,120
The dodo, I'm hearing Drew and Chris saying. What do you think?

989
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,440
I would be a. You'd be a fucking parrot.

990
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:41,320
I'd be a pterodactyl. You'd be the one who shared it with everyone.

991
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:45,840
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack. Wait, wait, wait.

992
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,840
What is that bird? It's not a parrot.

993
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,800
It's another bird that lives as long as a human does.

994
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,000
Chicken? No, not chicken.

995
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:58,760
No, not chicken. Lovely human. I'd be Toucan Sam.

996
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,460
But I don't remember exactly what type of bird it is, but it's a bird that lives as

997
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:04,400
long as a human and is actually very intelligent. A vulture?

998
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,920
No, not a vulture. Ooh, I'd be a vulture.

999
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:10,000
No, I'd be a raven because I'm all goth. Nevermore.

1000
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,600
What about the Norwegian blue? Lovely plumage. Lovely plumage.

1001
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,160
All right. He's pining for the fjords.

1002
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:21,120
He's not pining. He's passed on.

1003
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:26,720
This is an ex-parrot. Let's go to the next question here.

1004
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:31,280
Sakarina wants to know, do you guys have VJ Army accounts, and if so, what's your DJ name?

1005
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:36,840
I do have one, and I haven't ever updated it. I think it's Saku.

1006
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:40,080
I don't have one. I have one. I've never updated it. DJ 223M.

1007
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:43,240
I don't even know what it is. Yeah, I think mine's DJ Saku.

1008
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:47,160
I don't update it. It's too much work for me. I like BeatMania, but I haven't played

1009
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:51,120
it enough regularly lately. What's your favorite, also from Sakarina,

1010
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:56,440
what's your favorite 2DX style? Seventh.

1011
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:02,640
Eighth. Logie? I don't know. I don't play 2DX, really.

1012
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:07,200
Oh, yeah, that's right. You hate 2DX. I don't hate it. I just don't play it.

1013
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:11,080
Legend of Zaku wants to know, do you guys have any video game inspired drink recipes?

1014
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,960
Ooh, no. Any what inspired drink recipes?

1015
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:18,160
Video game inspired drink recipes, like mixed drinks that are inspired by video games.

1016
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:22,480
Burning Heat featuring Hot Damn. That's a good idea.

1017
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:27,920
Okay, I'm going to make up one right now. Okay.

1018
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:42,520
It's Everclear. Anything with Everclear. It'll have Everclear and let's see what else

1019
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:47,800
is pretty awesome. It'll just be Everclear and it'll call it

1020
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:54,400
the Super Metroid, because it'll suck your life out.

1021
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:58,160
Goldschlager is nasty shit. Goldschlager and Midori, remember that one?

1022
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:04,200
The drink is called the Abadox and it's made with Goldschlager and Jagermeister, two of

1023
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:09,080
the nasty and cheap tequila. And when you puke, that's the game.

1024
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:13,160
Because that's what Abadox looked like. All right, look.

1025
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:16,200
Just a couple more quick questions. We're not going to get to all the questions tonight.

1026
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:20,800
I apologize, guys. I love Abadox.

1027
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:24,280
Duckator wants to know, do coconuts migrate? Yes.

1028
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:31,640
Coconuts are non-migratory as would be carried by an African Swallow or European Swallow.

1029
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:34,200
You know what's funny is once I went to the grocery store, my old roommate and I were

1030
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,960
in college and we just bought a coconut because we just wanted to play with it.

1031
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,880
We wanted to see if we could open it using household tools, because we didn't know.

1032
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:45,120
Like you only see on TV. You were just interested in having a hairy

1033
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,560
ball. Oh, go to hell.

1034
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:49,800
Just fucking go to hell. All right.

1035
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:56,320
Oh, no, two more questions. SSJ100 Matt wants to know, ask Loki when he will do another

1036
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:59,360
Loki Fusion. I haven't done one in a while.

1037
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:04,040
I keep toying with it and it's just like writer's block, you know.

1038
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:07,160
For those that don't know Loki Fusion, you have your own DDR remix songs, right?

1039
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:11,440
Yeah. And they're on, what, Myspace.com slash Loki

1040
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,440
Fusion? Yeah.

1041
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:17,240
All right. All right, last question.

1042
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:21,720
I think this is a great question to end on. This is a serious one, okay?

1043
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,640
You may have to think about this one for a minute, but everybody's got to answer.

1044
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:29,280
At least the host, the three of us do. If you could go back to the beginning, prior

1045
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,280
to the show starting, this came from Solar Wing by the way, I don't know if I said it.

1046
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:36,640
If you could go back to the beginning, prior to the show starting, would you do it again

1047
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:44,520
or do it differently? This is a tough one.

1048
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:47,920
I would have said we should have had Loki on since episode one as a full blown co-host

1049
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:51,560
because we just didn't know him well enough then, but he wasn't a true co-host until episode

1050
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:53,840
20. A lot of people don't know that, but he wasn't

1051
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:57,760
truly a recognized co-host of the show until, he was kind of like a Drew, he just showed

1052
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:01,480
up all the fucking time. But yeah, he got promoted to co-host on episode

1053
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:06,680
20. I would have said we would have had Loki on board episode one.

1054
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,320
I don't know. I know what I would do different.

1055
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,000
What? Not use that retarded headset because I had

1056
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,520
a migraine the whole episode. Loki?

1057
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:17,300
This doesn't really have anything to do with Orange Lounge though.

1058
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:21,840
I wouldn't have built the cabinet. That was your pride and joy.

1059
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:27,260
I know, you spent so much. And threw it away like a baby, aborted and

1060
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:31,800
thrown in the dumpster. I don't think there's anything else. It's

1061
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:35,520
hard because we've just learned so many things. You know, I still have those DDR pads.

1062
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:41,160
I think I would have tried harder in the beginning to really believe that what we were doing

1063
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:44,360
was not just something we were fucking around online, but that it was really generally something

1064
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:47,080
people wanted to listen to and I think I would have tried to promote us better in the beginning.

1065
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:51,700
Or more general gaming maybe? I think in retrospect, I don't know though.

1066
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:56,120
We owe the Bamani scene a lot. I think honestly though, I would have made

1067
00:57:56,120 --> 00:58:01,160
the shift to general gaming about a year sooner. We should have done podcasting because we

1068
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:05,000
would have beat everybody to it by like two years.

1069
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:11,560
We should have invented podcasting. I still think that we've done pretty good

1070
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:15,600
for something that was conceived on the Bart after a trip to the Metronome.

1071
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:19,600
No regrets. I mean sure, there's always things that you might say, well gee, in retrospect

1072
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:23,280
maybe I should have done that, but no regrets. Well, this is what I think about regret. If

1073
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:27,520
you regret anything you have or have not done, you regret the person that you are today.

1074
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:32,880
So in respect to the show, I don't regret anything because our show is what it is based

1075
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,080
on the decisions that we've made, the interaction of our listeners.

1076
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:40,680
I do not regret a single second of it because that makes us what we are right now.

1077
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:43,880
SSJ100Matt brings up a good point. We were one of the first shows to introduce Skype

1078
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:47,800
calls. People don't recognize that, but we were probably like, if not, I would almost

1079
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,980
challenge, we were the first internet radio show to do Skype calls.

1080
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:56,240
I would challenge that. Find me a show that was doing it before we were because we got

1081
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,720
on board with that Skype thing really early, don't you think? Because we were doing it

1082
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:00,720
before we were even podcasting.

1083
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,120
We were doing it when Skype was in beta.

1084
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:04,600
Yeah, when Skype was in beta we were doing it because I was like...

1085
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,800
Actually, I think my Skype is still the beta version.

1086
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:07,800
So anyway...

1087
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:10,080
Skype was first in beta.

1088
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:13,600
I mean, I'm not trying to sound like egotistical, but I like to think of the fact that, hey,

1089
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,600
we've been on the cutting edge of a few things. It's been pretty...

1090
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:19,120
The PSP web browser, granted we haven't done too much with that.

1091
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:24,480
I mean, although I think we do a great show here, I think we owe the fact that we were

1092
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:28,880
one of the first gaming podcasts with an already established fan base thanks to our live show

1093
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,840
as the reason why we won the podcast award last year.

1094
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:35,920
I also think that we're not afraid to go there.

1095
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:41,360
That's one thing that we've always tried to hold onto is we don't really censor ourselves.

1096
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:46,080
We get it as it is. If we get an explicit tag one week, fuck it.

1097
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,760
Very good point. Very good point. Fuck it.

1098
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:49,760
Yeah.

1099
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:50,760
Right in the ear.

1100
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:51,760
Fuck the fucking fuckers.

1101
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:58,140
All right. On that note, I wanted to go around and see if anyone had any speeches, things

1102
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:01,440
they wanted to say to close out the show tonight.

1103
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:05,160
I just want to say, you know, I'll start.

1104
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:13,280
It's been a really interesting 200 episodes, and I've learned a lot, and I've received

1105
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:18,480
such wonderful compliments from you guys out there on the internet, and it makes me feel

1106
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:22,360
so good because, you know, when I was in college, I did not know what the hell I wanted to do

1107
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:29,200
with my life, and I was starting in, I was doing media arts for a while, meaning I was

1108
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,960
going to go into television and radio, but I was just convinced I was not cut out for

1109
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:38,000
radio because I was not going to blow my way to the top, which is what most people do in

1110
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
the radio industry.

1111
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,320
A lot of people that you hear on the afternoon drive probably fuck someone to get there,

1112
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,800
and I wasn't down with that.

1113
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:48,800
I wanted to do something, you know, that's when I knew I did not really want to play

1114
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:52,440
with the big boys and work that way, that I wanted to kind of do my own thing.

1115
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:59,760
So I really appreciate Travis kind of noticing that first on Station Live and kind of asking

1116
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:03,640
me to be a part of his show to kind of bring that out of me a little bit, which enabled

1117
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:07,600
me to, you know, get the idea going here with Dark Soccer, who I think felt very enabled

1118
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:11,640
by that program as well, to kind of come do our own thing here on Orange Lawn Radio, and

1119
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:17,960
it's been a fantastic experience, and to have come now to this point where we are working

1120
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:26,840
with a guy who started a television network about gaming is just, that's the path I wanted

1121
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:27,840
to take.

1122
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:28,840
You know what I mean?

1123
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:30,120
I didn't want to blow my way to the top.

1124
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:36,000
I wanted to work through the back door like a typical gay man, and I'm very happy.

1125
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,600
And Dark Soccer and Loki, you guys are awesome.

1126
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:43,000
And Loki, I really wish we would have had you on episode one, because we didn't know

1127
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,480
you, despite what you say, we didn't really know you.

1128
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:50,000
But it's been awesome, and when we lived together, we had a great time, and I don't think we

1129
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,480
ever fought once, which made you really great roommates.

1130
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:58,840
So that was just awesome, and getting to do the show that apartment in Dark Soccer, sometimes

1131
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,920
I want to jump out of this chair and strangle you for some of the things that you say on

1132
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:02,920
this program.

1133
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:03,920
I love you.

1134
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:09,320
No, but I love you to death, I love you to bits, and don't ever let anyone out there

1135
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:13,000
tell you that you're not good enough for this show, because you are good enough for this

1136
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:18,480
show, and you know so much about gaming and stuff, and the guys do not give you enough

1137
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,560
credit sometimes.

1138
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:23,680
You are a girl gamer, and oh God, I just love you.

1139
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:24,680
I think you're so smart.

1140
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:25,680
You're a record.

1141
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:28,820
Well, that's the point.

1142
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:34,600
So thank you for everything, and don't ever let internet fanboy people who are pissed

1143
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:38,400
off that some girl likes to yell at them once in a while ever get under your skin, because

1144
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:45,760
I know it was hard at first when we first went podcasting, but they suck.

1145
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,760
I can't say anything right now, because I'm emo.

1146
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:50,400
Lowkey, do you want to say anything?

1147
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,840
I don't know what the hell to say.

1148
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,520
I'm not good at this stuff.

1149
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,520
No, it's been fun.

1150
01:02:55,520 --> 01:03:00,520
I like doing the show, and it's just, Nellie doesn't probably like too much that I spend

1151
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:03,320
three hours of my week every week.

1152
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:08,840
Well, mentally probably way too much time on the show.

1153
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:12,760
I mean, my God, I can do stuff at work.

1154
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,000
It's all game related.

1155
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,680
It's always game related.

1156
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,460
Everything's always game related with me.

1157
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,080
Get a life, Lowkey.

1158
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:25,080
Seriously, I think getting married would change everything, but no, it doesn't.

1159
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:36,400
The only thing I'm focusing on now is just taking the show to the next step, not letting

1160
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:43,040
the other big sites out there bother you with the fact that people take them more seriously

1161
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:47,400
and that kind of stuff, because you either have to have a big financial backing or you

1162
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:50,840
just have to earn the respect for it.

1163
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:53,080
All that comes in time and money.

1164
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:55,960
I don't know, it's just going to be interesting.

1165
01:03:55,960 --> 01:04:05,720
I have no plans on quitting the show, so however long it goes.

1166
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:09,600
The first thing that I have to actually say about the show is that if it hadn't been for

1167
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:15,440
you guys, I don't think I would have made it through my diagnosis, because this is what

1168
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:16,440
kept me going.

1169
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:17,440
I had to give up school.

1170
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:18,440
I had to give up a lot of work.

1171
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:20,720
I had to give up my busy life.

1172
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:25,800
But having the show as a constant actually kept me going and everybody writing in with

1173
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:26,800
the support.

1174
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:30,760
I have to say that that was a big thing for me, because I've always considered myself

1175
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:35,880
to be a capable individual and to have that capability sort of get yanked out from under

1176
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:36,880
me.

1177
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:40,400
Having all the support of our listeners and talking to other people who've had similar

1178
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,320
is like, wow.

1179
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:47,440
That's the biggest thing, is having our listeners, having that type of support network.

1180
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:53,840
There's been the people who have, you know, I'm sorry, if you, it was sort of like what

1181
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:59,800
Margaret Cho said about Martha Stewart, she was put in jail for being a bitch.

1182
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:06,080
I feel like I get hate mail for being an outspoken woman, because there's still this vast majority

1183
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:10,720
of, and no offense to any of our guys listening, there's still this vast majority of men out

1184
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:14,880
there who think that just because they have a cock, they can tell women what to do.

1185
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:19,600
Well, I think G4 fucked a lot of that for everybody, for girls everywhere, because a

1186
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:24,440
lot of girl gamers on that shit, girl gamers, quote unquote, are just a set of tits.

1187
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:27,320
And Dark Sakura is so much more than just a nice set of tits.

1188
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:29,160
Although they are nice.

1189
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:33,960
They are nice tits, don't get me wrong, but there's just much more than that.

1190
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:43,700
But, you know, it's, it's, it actually gave, doing this show just from, even from getting

1191
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:48,600
under sedation, because it was you and Jessica, that, you know, Rob and Jessica.

1192
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:52,720
Speaking of a nice set of tits, she was, she was wonderful too.

1193
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:56,960
I have to say thank you to Jessica, because I'll go back to that in a minute.

1194
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:57,960
Go ahead.

1195
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:02,460
You guys brought me in on under sedation and I had been just sort of, you know, I've always

1196
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:07,120
been outspoken for people, but very nervous in large groups, you know, and I really got

1197
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:15,800
me over a lot of my, my shyness, I think that my residual shyness gave me a lot more ability

1198
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:23,160
or I say confidence to really say, you know, tact is one thing, but censoring yourself

1199
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:28,120
for the sake, you know, censoring the truth, I think, or how you really feel for the sake

1200
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:34,680
of political correctness or somebody else's retarded sensitivities.

1201
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:41,060
Doing the show has completely opened up that side of me that has given me courage to stand

1202
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:47,920
up for myself as a woman, not just to the gaming community, but at work, you know, in

1203
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:55,680
my daily life, you know, I, I feel completely, I mean, doing this, this show has been such

1204
01:06:55,680 --> 01:07:03,440
a confidence booster that, you know, and I think everybody who's, who has supported my

1205
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:11,680
loud mouth, outspoken, bitchy Aries womanliness, I want to thank all of you.

1206
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:15,040
And whoever's king, my Lancer needs to die right now.

1207
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,040
Amazing.

1208
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:17,040
Wow.

1209
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:19,760
Thank you guys so much.

1210
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:25,880
Yes, Drew and Chris, if you guys want to add anything, you don't have to.

1211
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:27,540
Shit, shit, guys.

1212
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:28,540
It's been a wild ride.

1213
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:32,100
I mean, I've been with the guys since episode two, you know, we jumped, jumped the shark

1214
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:36,640
in episode one, apparently, but I've been here for the whole downhill ride.

1215
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:43,400
And I was listening when I was 16, it's kind of funny that this show sort of defined my

1216
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:44,960
adult social life.

1217
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:49,760
I grew up with this show and it's kind of sad and it's kind of cool at the same time

1218
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:55,680
because for the past few years, this show has been the main constant.

1219
01:07:55,680 --> 01:08:04,560
And I, you know, I go from awkward teen to intern to scapegoat to bad joke master and

1220
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:05,560
you know what?

1221
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:06,560
I'm still here.

1222
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:11,160
The show is still going strong and I hope, you know, we continue this course for a long

1223
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:19,080
time to come because this is the best thing on the internet right now, at least my opinion.

1224
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:20,080
Thank you.

1225
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:21,080
Wow.

1226
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:22,080
Thanks.

1227
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,080
And thank you for being so supportive of us.

1228
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:24,080
You are a true fan.

1229
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:27,960
I've always been, you know, one of our number one fans throughout the years.

1230
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:28,960
It's amazing.

1231
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:31,680
Shit, I lost my train of thought.

1232
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:38,120
Oh, I wanted to say about Jessica from Understadation Live, something that I don't know if it's

1233
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:42,920
ever been said, Jessica and I couldn't fucking stand each other the last year that we did

1234
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:45,120
Understadation Live.

1235
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,120
And it's cool.

1236
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:47,120
We're cool now.

1237
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,320
I mean, so, you know, it's okay that I say that.

1238
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:51,600
I couldn't say that a couple of years ago, but I can say it now, Jessica and I cannot

1239
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:52,600
fucking stand each other.

1240
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,240
I mean, it was really hard to do that program.

1241
01:08:55,240 --> 01:09:03,800
So I know from experience that being such good friends with you guys is such a relief.

1242
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,560
It makes doing this show so much easier.

1243
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:11,480
And I truly do look forward to having this show every week as being a way that we can,

1244
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:14,200
you know, hang out with each other because sometimes our lives are so busy we can't do

1245
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:15,840
it without this constant.

1246
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:20,680
I do have to say, though, just to your and Jessica's credit, you both hit it very well

1247
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:22,240
on the air.

1248
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:23,240
It's professional.

1249
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:28,600
When I saw Chicago, the end of that movie, and if anybody wants to know exactly what

1250
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:32,360
it was like, go watch the end of Chicago, because that's exactly what it was between

1251
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:33,360
Jessica and I.

1252
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:34,360
It was like we could have...

1253
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:36,560
We wanted to kill each other, but it was one of those things where it was like, well, show

1254
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:37,560
business.

1255
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:38,560
We're just going to get out there and do it.

1256
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:39,560
Yeah, we...

1257
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:42,760
Yes, to her credit, she was very good at hiding it.

1258
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:46,240
And there was even one episode where we had to fake that...

1259
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:47,320
It was an April Fool's thing.

1260
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:51,920
We had to fake that Travis left, and Jessica and I took over the show, and you would have

1261
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,780
never known that Jessica and I...

1262
01:09:53,780 --> 01:09:56,800
That was right after Jessica and I were about ready to kill each other, when everything

1263
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:57,800
went down.

1264
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:00,920
That episode was right after that, so it was something else.

1265
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:04,920
I just remember listening to that episode and sitting at my computer about to bawl,

1266
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:07,280
because you know what my position was in between that.

1267
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:10,280
Chris, did you want to say anything?

1268
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:11,760
I don't know how much I can contribute.

1269
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:14,280
I'm kind of a new listener, so...

1270
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:15,280
Newbies?

1271
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,520
Yeah, newbies.

1272
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:20,160
I'm a noob.

1273
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:24,640
I actually met you, Rob, the first time when we saw Silent Hill.

1274
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:32,840
That was the first time I met you, and I listened to a podcast right before that, and I've never

1275
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:35,200
really been into video games.

1276
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:39,640
I mean, I like video games, but I'm one of those people that is really interested in

1277
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:44,640
something, but has absolutely no idea what you guys are talking about.

1278
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:51,400
So it's been very educational listening to you guys, and I just didn't know about the

1279
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:53,640
Wii until you guys talked about it.

1280
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:56,200
So all my gaming news I pretty much get from you guys.

1281
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,200
That's hardcore.

1282
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,080
Yeah, it's really hardcore.

1283
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:04,120
But it's just nice to make friends, because I don't have a lot of friends, actually.

1284
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:05,120
Aww, we love you.

1285
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,120
A chatroom loves you, too.

1286
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:07,120
You know they love you.

1287
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:08,120
I love...

1288
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:09,120
Yeah.

1289
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:10,720
And just for the record, Chris also has a very nice set of tits.

1290
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:13,880
I know it's radio, so you guys can't see.

1291
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:14,880
He's lying.

1292
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:15,880
No, I'm not.

1293
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:16,880
No, I'm not.

1294
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:17,880
No, I'm not.

1295
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:19,280
No, I'm being realistic.

1296
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:22,360
I am normal, average.

1297
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:23,360
Thank you, Robbo.

1298
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:24,360
Stop.

1299
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:25,360
Stop.

1300
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:26,360
Shut up, Robbo.

1301
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:27,360
All right.

1302
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,360
We have one more person that has a speech.

1303
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:31,360
Okay.

1304
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:35,760
BlackWolf in our chatroom says, and you know, guesting on OLR was a highlight of my podcasting

1305
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:36,760
career.

1306
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:41,200
You sappy bitch, you've got a great podcast.

1307
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:47,920
He's done 50 himself, and he's done Dragon Con, I mean, he's done cons bigger than we

1308
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:48,920
have.

1309
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:49,920
Don't get sappy.

1310
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,920
I don't know if it's the champagne, but I do feel a little weepy.

1311
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:53,920
Do you have another glass?

1312
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:54,920
All right.

1313
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:55,920
Go ahead.

1314
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:56,920
All right, look.

1315
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:57,920
Here's the thing.

1316
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:03,920
Let's turn this show around and start to end this thing on a positive note, because for

1317
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:04,920
a long...

1318
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:05,920
I thought we ended on a high note.

1319
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:06,920
Look, for a long...

1320
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:11,860
We actually are going to be ending on a bit of a high note, but I ain't singing it.

1321
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:13,200
Here's the deal.

1322
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:20,240
There's been a moment in Orange Lounge Radio's history that people, for whatever reason,

1323
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:24,080
just seem to love and have never shut up about since the night it happened.

1324
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:30,520
The night it happened was November 16th, 2003, and I think it went down in a lot of people's

1325
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:33,440
minds in Orange Lounge Radio's history.

1326
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:34,440
Here's the weird thing.

1327
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,640
Jamie wasn't even there that night when this happened.

1328
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,920
I was staying in the Harry Potter room in the gay frat house.

1329
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:47,040
And folks have been begging and begging to please post this somewhere so I can download

1330
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:48,040
it.

1331
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:49,040
No!

1332
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:53,400
So here it is, boys and girls, on this special 200th podcast.

1333
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:57,560
A little clip from episode 69 of Orange Lounge Radio.

1334
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:00,160
Loki plays karaoke revolution.

1335
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:01,160
Wait.

1336
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:07,720
I just have to say, the sound quality sucks because we were on dial-up back then, okay?

1337
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:09,720
So just bear with us.

1338
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:18,600
Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

1339
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:22,560
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

1340
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:30,160
All right, we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and as promised, we're now going to

1341
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:33,640
show off our karaoke talents in a round of karaoke revolution.

1342
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:37,640
Say it again.

1343
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:39,640
I'm singing.

1344
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:40,640
I'm...

1345
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:42,640
I'm not gay.

1346
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:44,640
I'm singing.

1347
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:48,640
I'm happy with my friend.

1348
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:50,640
I'm singing.

1349
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:55,640
I want the world to know.

1350
01:13:55,640 --> 01:14:00,640
I'm happy with pussy.

1351
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:03,640
I'm singing.

1352
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:06,640
I want the world to know.

1353
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:10,640
Got the night in show.

1354
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:15,640
There's a new me singing.

1355
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:17,640
He's laughing.

1356
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:20,640
I'm completely happy.

1357
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:25,640
Stop making me laugh, Kermit, like you never knew it.

1358
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:28,640
I'll make it through.

1359
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:32,640
The time has come for me, breaking out of the shell.

1360
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:36,640
I have to shout that I'm staying in.

1361
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:39,640
I'm staying in.

1362
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:41,640
I want the world to know.

1363
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:45,640
I'm happy with the pussy.

1364
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:47,640
I'm staying in.

1365
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:50,640
I want the world to know.

1366
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:54,640
I shop on the same side of the street.

1367
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,640
I got to show the world.

1368
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,640
Yeah, I'm on the scene.

1369
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:00,640
All my abilities.

1370
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,640
There's so much for me.

1371
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:05,640
Somehow I have to make them.

1372
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:07,640
Just don't understand.

1373
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:09,640
I've got it all in hand.

1374
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:12,640
Oh, how I've got it planned.

1375
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:14,640
I'm spreading the love.

1376
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,640
There's more for me to fear.

1377
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:18,640
And I just feel so good.

1378
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,640
Every time I hear.

1379
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:23,640
I'm staying in.

1380
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:25,640
I'm happy with the females.

1381
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:29,640
Got to let it show.

1382
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:31,640
I'm actually causing this song.

1383
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:34,640
That's pretty amazing, I think.

1384
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:40,640
Since I can't sing worth a shit.

1385
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:41,640
Oh, yeah.

1386
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:42,640
Play that instant mental soul.

1387
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:43,640
Oh, yeah.

1388
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:48,640
Oh, yeah.

1389
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:55,640
Yeah, work in the crowd.

1390
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:57,640
Yeah.

1391
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:58,640
Yeah.

1392
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:00,640
There's my pictures in the crowd.

1393
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:04,640
Fuck yeah.

1394
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:06,640
I'm coming in.

1395
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:09,640
I want the world to know.

1396
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:13,640
Got to let it show.

1397
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,640
I'm staying in.

1398
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:17,640
I'm happy with hetero.

1399
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:21,640
Just want everyone to know.

1400
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:24,640
I'm staying in.

1401
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,640
I want the world to know.

1402
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:30,640
Women are my thing.

1403
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:33,640
I'm staying in.

1404
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:34,640
I'm sick of this song.

1405
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:38,640
You're going to really die.

1406
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,640
God, this is long.

1407
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:43,640
It just doesn't fucking end.

1408
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:47,640
Just keeps on going on.

1409
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:50,640
I'm going to kill anyone in the chat room that has a recording of this.

1410
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:51,640
You're going to so die.

1411
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,640
I know where you live.

1412
01:16:53,640 --> 01:17:00,640
As a reminder, the show will be broadcast this week on Thursday.

1413
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:03,640
A score of 6,964 points for Loki.

1414
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:05,640
Not even a gold record.

1415
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:07,640
There is no justice in this world.

1416
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:11,640
We're going to shut the game off now.

1417
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:13,640
I have not laughed that hard.

1418
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:16,640
I laughed so hard I peed.

1419
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,640
I peed a little.

1420
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:20,640
I peed a little bit.

1421
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,640
I got to hear this when I came back.

1422
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:24,640
You weren't even there that week.

1423
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,640
The girl in there was our original show host, Madam.

1424
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:30,640
She needs to come back and be on the show soon.

1425
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,640
Loki?

1426
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:38,640
We'll put him up.

1427
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:41,640
God, our show sounded like shit back then, didn't it?

1428
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:47,640
You know what? We should have never been a dial-up friendly station.

1429
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:54,640
I have both recordings already edited out.

1430
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:57,640
I'm not sure if they were recorded on my computer at the time.

1431
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:59,640
I think they were edited out of the show.

1432
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:00,640
Loki is going to kill me.

1433
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:01,640
I have the deep, dark secret.

1434
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:03,640
I was the one who distributed that.

1435
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:05,640
Whatever. I don't care.

1436
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:08,640
Here's the thing. Episode 300 we have is complicated.

1437
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,640
But until then...

1438
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:12,640
No, now listen.

1439
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:14,640
Here's what we'll do.

1440
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:17,640
The MP3 is on the MySpace page.

1441
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:19,640
We've been getting kind of stale.

1442
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:21,640
We'll put both of them up.

1443
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:23,640
We'll see what we can do.

1444
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:26,640
I thought you sounded okay.

1445
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:29,640
You should have heard complicated.

1446
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:31,640
Maybe pick a random song.

1447
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:33,640
Avril Lavigne is complicated?

1448
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:35,640
Now that's sexy.

1449
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:38,640
Alright guys, I really do not like Karaoke Revolution.

1450
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:40,640
We will be back here next week.

1451
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:44,640
As always, Sunday night, September 24th, 2006

1452
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:48,640
with Orange Launch Radio episode number 201.

1453
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:51,640
Same old shit, different week.

1454
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:53,640
DDR Sneak Peaks continue next week.

1455
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:57,640
Hoping to have an interview next week with a very interesting independent product.

1456
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:59,640
I'm looking forward to getting more on that.

1457
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:03,640
But for now, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

1458
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:06,640
Drew Nami, thanks so much for being here again this week.

1459
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:07,640
What's your final thought?

1460
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:10,640
Be excellent to each other.

1461
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:12,640
Chris, what's your final thought?

1462
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:13,640
Party on, dudes!

1463
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:14,640
Chris, your final thought?

1464
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,640
Party time! Excellent!

1465
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,640
I have no final thought.

1466
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:19,640
My brain is dead.

1467
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:21,640
But happy 200, guys.

1468
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:22,640
Thank you.

1469
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:23,640
It's awesome.

1470
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:26,640
Enjoy your fat-causing product of chocolate.

1471
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:31,640
My final thought is peanut butter.

1472
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:32,640
Loki.

1473
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:36,640
Would I say jelly time?

1474
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:40,640
Let's see here.

1475
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:43,640
What the fuck are you doing?

1476
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:49,640
I think the living room was inspired by us.

1477
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:51,640
They're playing Comcast Karaoke right now.

1478
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:52,640
They were playing that before.

1479
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:58,640
No, but you might see another show come back, maybe.

1480
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,640
I'm not going to make any promises.

1481
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:02,640
Dark Sakura, your final thought?

1482
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:04,640
I have to always say reject false icons.

1483
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,640
It is episode 200.

1484
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:08,640
The photo says buck futter.

1485
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:10,640
Buck futter?

1486
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:16,640
I read that and I was singing of that Chiba Mato song, Butterfucker.

1487
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:20,640
I was singing that in my car.

1488
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:27,640
But I'm full of emotional happy right now and cake.

1489
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:32,640
Oh, stop taking my foot!

1490
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:38,640
As always, thank you guys for supporting independent radio for the past 200 weeks.

1491
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:40,640
You guys are awesome.

1492
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:45,640
And we can't wait to start all over next week with Orange Lounge Radio episode number 201.

1493
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:52,640
Until then, this is Rob Roberts for Dark Sakura, Loki, Junami, and Chris saying see you next week.

1494
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:23,640
Thanks for watching!
