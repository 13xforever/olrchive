25000	28000	Orange Lounge Radio
29000	31000	Attention!
32000	36000	Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?
37000	43000	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Mani Talk and then some.
46000	53000	Orange Lounge may contain adult content. Orange Lounge may contain many four letter words.
53000	60000	Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity. Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.
61000	64000	Just kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex in this episode.
65000	70000	The last Metroid is in captivity. The galaxy is at peace.
71000	75000	Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.
76000	80000	Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted and mildly retarded content.
80000	85000	You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
86000	89000	Yes, I will spank your child. If you're not going to do your job, God damn it, I will.
90000	93000	Oh wait, most children already are evil little demons from hell.
98000	102000	Now you see that evil will always triumph because good is dumb.
103000	105000	Fact, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life, sir.
105000	109000	He jeopardizes my ability to effectively govern this student body.
110000	113000	Well, it makes you look like an ass is what he does, Ed.
114000	117000	Samburgers, the cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast.
118000	120000	That was huge. Cool.
121000	124000	Do you mind if I take my new car for a ride?
125000	128000	Catherine, the only thing you're going to be riding is me.
129000	130000	Have you seen Mountain Dew?
130000	134000	Lena, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my underground lair.
135000	137000	So it was you. I was going to expose you.
138000	140000	I know. So I choose to expose myself.
141000	142000	Please, there are ladies present.
143000	144000	This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
145000	146000	Dark Sakura.
147000	148000	Oh my God, I see a bloody stump!
149000	151000	Sky. Anytime in the place, baby.
152000	155000	Loki. Ow, my foot! Why did I shoot myself in my foot?
156000	158000	Orange Lounge Radio.
158000	166000	We are live, and this is episode number 200 for this September the 17th of 2006.
167000	177000	You're listening to the Bemani Scene's most ancient podcast and radio station of all things Bemani.
178000	186000	But as of about a year ago, all things video games, tonight is a very special show, boys and girls.
186000	189000	Yes, that intro was specially made just for tonight. Hope you enjoyed it.
190000	192000	Oh my God, there's fire in here right now.
193000	198000	Chris has surprised us with her presence, and she's brought us a cake with a big 200 on it.
199000	202000	Wait, hold on, hold on. I have to take a picture on my cell phone so we have something for the site.
203000	206000	Rob, have I told you lately that I love you for that intro?
207000	208000	I just want to...
209000	210000	I forgot about the bloody stump.
211000	213000	I just want to warn people, if this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge...
213000	215000	Oh my God, you almost dropped that fucking cake.
216000	220000	I just want to warn you guys, if this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio, tonight is going to be a really fucked up episode.
221000	225000	We are celebrating our 200th episode. We have a lot of surprises in store, and I guess this is one of them.
226000	227000	I had no idea we had a cake coming.
228000	229000	Okay, Loki, Dark Soccer, we have to all blow out the candles together.
230000	231000	Look out, they're going to blow.
232000	233000	Look out, we're going to blow.
234000	235000	Oh, this is so cute. I took a picture, we'll put it up on the website later.
236000	237000	What are we wishing for?
238000	239000	One, two, three.
240000	241000	Yay!
241000	242000	We blew them all out, it comes true.
243000	244000	All right.
245000	247000	Thank you guys so much, this is awesome.
248000	249000	Wow.
250000	251000	Well, my name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.
252000	253000	Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only...
254000	258000	I was trying to reinvoke the old intro there, but that threw me off.
259000	260000	So much for that.
261000	262000	It's cake pie.
263000	264000	Cake pie!
265000	266000	Say hello to the...
267000	268000	Another surprise, I got another surprise.
268000	270000	Oh my God, I got a...
271000	272000	What?
273000	277000	This is just craziness, I just got a T.R. that says over the hill and Loki has one too.
278000	279000	That's great.
280000	281000	And Jamie has one too.
282000	283000	Oh my God, you guys are too much.
284000	285000	Oh, you guys, thank you.
286000	287000	Okay.
288000	289000	Happy happy birthday from the internet to you.
290000	291000	We wish it was our birthday so we could party too.
292000	294000	Hey, happy happy birthday, all your gamer dreams come true.
295000	296000	Happy happy birthday from all of us to you.
296000	297000	Happy happy birthday.
298000	299000	Oh my God.
302000	304000	I don't know if I'm going to be able to do tonight's show.
305000	306000	Alright, say hello to the one and only...
307000	310000	Happiest bunny on the farm is Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
313000	314000	Who found the ferret?
315000	316000	I found the ferret!
317000	318000	Woo!
319000	320000	Woo, ferret!
321000	322000	Oh my God.
323000	324000	Say hello to Tech Masa Loki.
324000	327000	There's a lot of people in here that need less caffeine and sugar.
328000	329000	That's alright.
330000	334000	And say hello to Drew Nami who's here with us as he has been a lot lately.
335000	337000	Who needs to learn to put the microphone next to his mouth?
338000	339000	Definitely one person needs more caffeine, damn.
340000	341000	Alright.
342000	345000	Alright, say hello as well to Chris who's brought us all these wonderful surprises.
346000	347000	Thank you, Chris.
348000	350000	Oh, that's okay, I thought of it up as Jamie and I were eating lunch and I said,
350000	353000	You know what? I should bring donuts. You know what? Fuck that.
354000	356000	It's their special birthday. We need something better.
357000	359000	So we thought we'd get the carbiest, most sugariest thing we could find,
360000	362000	which has a very rainbow-y happy birthday to it.
363000	364000	This is so awesome.
365000	366000	Our cake is so gay.
367000	369000	The surprises are just beginning, you guys, tonight.
370000	371000	We have a lot of crap in store tonight.
372000	374000	Even the chat room doesn't know about some of the stuff we got planned.
375000	376000	It's going to be a very interesting show.
377000	378000	We have cake pie.
378000	379000	We're going to get to cake.
380000	381000	But first, and we do have DDR Sneak Peaks continuing tonight,
382000	383000	a very special edition of the DDR Sneak Peaks.
384000	386000	And it was confirmed, the ferret is gay.
387000	388000	We have our gay ferret.
389000	390000	Alright, let's try to get some gaming news out of our system
391000	392000	because we have a lot, a lot, a lot of it this week.
393000	394000	So first off, we start off every show.
395000	396000	How was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?
397000	399000	My gaming week was actually still more pinball.
400000	401000	We got another pinball machine.
402000	403000	Another one.
404000	405000	We have a Guns N' Roses pinball.
405000	407000	My God, you guys are nuts.
408000	409000	We're working on it right now.
410000	411000	And I played some more Mario.
412000	414000	And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, that's it.
415000	416000	Alright.
417000	418000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
419000	420000	Oh, I watched some porn too.
421000	422000	Congratulations.
423000	424000	And I got some Yowie now.
425000	426000	I thought you said, how was your gaming week?
427000	428000	I don't know if that would be considered gaming.
429000	430000	I consider it fun.
431000	432000	You could play the Yowie drinking game.
432000	435000	I streamed HD porn to my 360, so does that count?
436000	437000	I was, I was there when you did that.
438000	439000	Tell everyone, do I get to lick the frosting off the candle?
440000	441000	Yes.
442000	443000	Well, actually, I had another one too that we downloaded
444000	445000	that we streamed off my wonderful laptop here
446000	447000	because it has Media Center Edition on it.
448000	450000	But, no, yeah, you can stream stuff with Media Accenter,
451000	452000	Media Center Accenter.
453000	456000	And, unfortunately, well, actually, fortunately,
457000	459000	the only thing that we had to test it with is porno.
459000	464000	So we streamed, you know, 720p porno.
465000	467000	And the only thing we had to test with was porno.
468000	469000	So, yeah.
470000	472000	So we did that and it is very crisp.
473000	474000	Very, very crisp.
475000	476000	The only thing I'm disappointed with...
477000	479000	I actually saw it too and I will never see a clearer muff
480000	481000	in my entire life.
482000	483000	The only thing that's bad about it though,
484000	487000	and I don't know if, I couldn't stream it with like Dolby
487000	488000	or anything like that.
489000	490000	That would be really cool if I could do that.
491000	493000	But, you know, whatever, it's cool.
494000	495000	So we did that.
496000	498000	So actual gaming stuff, I actually played some stuff
499000	500000	including, and I don't know why,
501000	503000	I got it for free from work, Bomberman Act Zero,
504000	505000	and it started off pretty fun,
506000	508000	but the whole thing, it's really sad
509000	512000	that the game fails by things that I would think
513000	515000	that would be really easy for the devs to either fix
515000	518000	or, I don't know, figure out that they were wrong
519000	520000	in the first place.
521000	522000	The first thing, of course, being the fact
523000	524000	that you can't save at all.
525000	526000	So if you were to beat the game,
527000	528000	you had to play through 99 levels straight.
529000	530000	By the way, only one kill, or one hit and you're dead
531000	532000	and you have to go all the way back to one,
533000	534000	so that kind of sucks.
535000	536000	There's no live system or anything like that.
537000	538000	That's really kind of the only thing
539000	540000	that detracts you from the whole game.
541000	542000	That and the fact that the camera angles
542000	544000	and everything like that.
545000	546000	So, I don't know, it gets annoying,
547000	548000	but it's still Bomberman.
549000	550000	It's pretty fun, but, you know,
551000	552000	I wouldn't have paid money for it,
553000	554000	so thank God I didn't have to.
555000	556000	Then I played a lot of Xbox Live Arcade stuff.
557000	558000	I accidentally downloaded Time Pilot
559000	560000	because I meant to download Scramble,
561000	562000	so I ended up downloading them both,
563000	564000	and to be honest, Scramble's kind of lame
565000	566000	and so is Time Pilot.
567000	569000	Konami, you need to really make some better games
569000	571000	to put them out on live.
572000	575000	Also, maybe make your games, I don't know, widescreen.
576000	577000	I mean, seriously, if they remade it
578000	579000	for the graphics and stuff,
580000	581000	why didn't they just add widescreen support to it?
582000	583000	I don't know, that wouldn't be that difficult.
584000	585000	You get pretty borders on the left
586000	587000	and right side of the screen.
588000	589000	Same borders are in every Konami arcade game.
590000	591000	Anyways, so I played those.
592000	593000	I played a little bit more Geometry Wars.
594000	595000	I played multiplayer on Marvel Blast,
596000	597000	which was kind of lame.
597000	598000	I played multiplayer on Marvel Blast
599000	600000	because every time you start a multiplayer game,
601000	602000	you're in the middle of someone else's game,
603000	604000	so there's no possible way for you to win
605000	606000	because they're like 75 points ahead of you.
607000	608000	Well, wait until the game's over
609000	610000	and then they start a new game.
611000	612000	That's fine, but that doesn't always happen.
613000	614000	That's kind of lame, but whatever.
615000	616000	What else did I play?
617000	618000	More Grand Theft Auto, of course.
619000	620000	Actually, I emailed Rockstar
621000	622000	about Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories
623000	624000	because we do play it so much
624000	626000	and we were bragging, or I was bragging to them
627000	628000	that I probably played it more than the devs did,
629000	630000	and I think I probably did
631000	632000	since it doesn't seem like they played it much.
633000	636000	And then, yeah, so hopefully I'll hear back from them
637000	638000	because I want to know how their multiplayer's
639000	640000	coming for that game because they better not fuck it up
641000	644000	or I will fly down there and beat them to death.
645000	646000	Anything else?
647000	648000	Oh, I played Mario Kart on the DS
649000	651000	while I was waiting for my dad for a movie today.
651000	654000	Fun? I played bow mode, and I don't like the bow movement.
655000	657000	All right, I'm going to our chat room,
658000	659000	which of course is always one of our other guests,
660000	661000	www.orangesonshady.com.
662000	663000	Oh, I'm sorry, and I played Chrome Helms in multiplayer.
664000	665000	And got your ass kicked from what I hear.
666000	667000	Well, that's because my mic sucks.
668000	669000	I'm looking at our chat room.
670000	671000	In fact, so many people in chat tonight,
672000	673000	the names are scrolling off the screen.
674000	675000	We can't see.
676000	677000	Anyway, I want to point out,
678000	679000	Robert M. in chat says,
679000	680000	when did you see Jairus on live?
681000	682000	It's coming. We know it's coming.
683000	684000	It's been previously announced.
685000	686000	When? Couldn't tell you,
687000	688000	but that's one I'm looking forward to as well.
689000	690000	I love Jairus. Awesome game.
691000	692000	My gaming week.
693000	694000	I actually played a lot of different games.
695000	696000	I'll stick to the new stuff, though.
697000	698000	I played Scramble, even though I said on the show
699000	700000	I wasn't going to. I couldn't help it.
701000	702000	I downloaded it. I like the new art style,
703000	704000	which I thought is kind of interesting.
705000	706000	But the game itself is kind of anti-climatic.
706000	709000	The stages are so short, and each one of the stages
710000	711000	has some type of little niche to it.
712000	714000	Like, oh, stage three is where they're going to throw fireballs at you.
715000	716000	Oh, stage four is where you have to take...
717000	718000	I don't like stage two. It's stupid.
719000	720000	I don't know what the fuck it is.
721000	722000	The little asteroid things are pissing me off.
723000	724000	But, okay, the game's from 81.
725000	726000	What can you expect?
727000	728000	I mean, it's obviously an old, old game,
729000	730000	but I would have just rather that effort
731000	732000	that they took porting Scramble be spent on like Gradius,
733000	734000	which is a far superior shooter.
734000	735000	It will not let me shoot as fast as I want to.
736000	737000	You know the trick? This is what I do.
738000	739000	I put the controller down, and I tap the buttons
740000	743000	like my fingers are running between bullet bomb,
744000	745000	bullet bomb, bullet bomb, and I do that really fast,
746000	748000	and that's how I get all the way through stage four, at least.
749000	750000	Because stage five, the trick is you have to maneuver around
751000	752000	really quickly, and it's kind of hard.
753000	754000	Since that ship is like a boat.
755000	760000	So, anyway, we have done Scramble, and it's okay.
761000	762000	I mean, if you like the classics,
762000	763000	the upgrade was actually one of the nicer upgrades.
764000	765000	The graphics do look really well,
766000	767000	and the sound's been done a lot better.
768000	769000	But the game itself, I just can't recommend it
770000	771000	when it's put next to five dollar games
772000	773000	such as, you know, Geometry Wars,
774000	775000	and hell, even something like Frogger or Time Pilot
776000	777000	was a better buy than Scramble.
778000	779000	I'm sorry to say I wish they would put effort
780000	781000	into better games, but that's just me.
782000	785000	The other game I played was surprisingly pleasant.
786000	787000	I played Test Drive Unlimited,
788000	789000	which I actually enjoyed quite a bit.
789000	791000	The gameplay is a lot like it reminded me
792000	793000	of Need for Speed Underground,
794000	795000	and so you're probably thinking to yourself,
796000	798000	okay, why do I need yet another racer on the Xbox 360?
799000	800000	What makes this so special?
801000	802000	Well, Test Drive Unlimited is massive.
803000	805000	You are literally driving around the entire island of Oahu,
806000	809000	and it's not, you know, 100% geographically correct,
810000	811000	but for folks who've never been there like me,
812000	814000	it's got that illusion of that it does seem to be pretty,
815000	816000	you know, right on to what it's probably
816000	818000	really like in that environment.
819000	820000	And you drive around and you do different races,
821000	822000	like you stop at different intersections and do races,
823000	825000	or you pick up hookers and take them to the shopping place
826000	827000	they need to go, or you drive cars, hitchhikers,
828000	830000	lots of different types of quests and things you can do.
831000	832000	It's a questing driving game.
833000	834000	But the other weird thing about it
835000	836000	that's getting this game a lot of notoriety
837000	838000	is that even when you're playing in single-player mode,
839000	840000	if you're playing on Xbox Live,
841000	843000	some of the dummy cars that you usually see driving in traffic
843000	845000	are actually other players.
846000	847000	And you'll see their Xbox Live name,
848000	849000	they are playing single mode as well.
850000	852000	So it's kind of like an MMO, but not really.
853000	854000	It's the weirdest concept.
855000	856000	That is exactly why I can't get that game,
857000	858000	because I'd be such a jackass.
859000	860000	I'd be like, attack!
861000	863000	I'll tell you what though, I love the idea,
864000	866000	and I think it's great that they're doing this
867000	869000	to make the game different than other racing games,
870000	871000	but I don't know.
871000	872000	I find when I'm racing around,
873000	874000	I don't really run into other people
875000	876000	right next to them very often.
877000	878000	I've driven by maybe three people.
879000	880000	Supposedly you're supposed to crash into them
881000	883000	and start a race, but sometimes they drive by so fast
884000	885000	you don't even realize that somebody went by.
886000	887000	I guess that's what you have to do.
888000	889000	It's interesting. It's an interesting concept.
890000	891000	I'll have to play the game a little more
892000	894000	to see how it's fully enabled.
895000	896000	I just joined the oil army clan.
897000	898000	Thanks to Rob Way, he created the oil army clan on the game,
898000	900000	so I just joined that.
901000	902000	Look for that if you're on Test Drive,
903000	905000	and hopefully you'll be able to experience more
906000	907000	of what multiplayer has to offer.
908000	909000	Speaking of the oil army,
910000	911000	I'm going to be releasing the general design
912000	914000	for the t-shirts for anybody who wants to make one
915000	917000	until we can get the ability to put them up.
918000	919000	We should register our numbers though.
920000	921000	How are our numbers?
922000	923000	Awesome. The other quick thing I wanted to say
924000	925000	about Test Drive Unlimited is I was kind of bummed out
925000	927000	that some of the multiplayer races, at least none of the ones I drove by,
928000	929000	were restricted by car class,
930000	932000	because I got the game about a week after it came out
933000	934000	and by the time I'm ready to do multiplayer races
935000	937000	everybody in there has a souped-up, maximum, top-of-the-line car,
938000	939000	so I would have liked to have seen some multiplayer races
940000	941000	that were restricted a little more by the class car
942000	944000	so you could have beginner multiplayer races, intermediate,
945000	946000	and not everybody's just kicking my ass
947000	948000	because they have a top-of-the-line car
949000	949000	because they've been playing longer.
950000	951000	That was my thought.
952000	953000	I do recommend Test Drive Unlimited
953000	954000	if you're a fan of driving games,
955000	956000	and I think even if you're not a fan of driving games,
957000	958000	rent it, check it out, because you might...
959000	960000	I mean, it's a good deal, 40 bucks.
961000	962000	It's cheaper than the usual Xbox 360 game,
963000	964000	so it's hard for me to ignore that as well,
965000	966000	being a big factor in why I would recommend this game
967000	968000	for you to pick up.
969000	970000	Plus, it's fun driving a Lamborghini off-road.
971000	972000	It is, but the cops get annoying.
973000	974000	They get really annoying.
975000	976000	I wish there was a way you could turn them off.
977000	978000	No, it's funny, but the cops, they can't follow you off-road.
979000	980000	Oh, really? I didn't realize that.
980000	982000	No, they're stupid. They can't figure out how to get off the road,
983000	984000	so I have to just drive through an unpaved section.
985000	986000	There's like, duh, where'd he go?
987000	988000	Or just sit in the grass, and they're like,
989000	990000	oh, I don't know how to get to him.
991000	991000	JeremyTau1 in chat says,
992000	993000	a friend I know that lives in Hawaii says
994000	995000	the map is really close to the area, but it isn't perfect.
996000	997000	He says he can see where he is in the game
998000	999000	because he knows the roads in person,
1000000	1001000	so yeah, it's pretty close to the actual thing.
1002000	1003000	It's kind of interesting.
1004000	1004000	All right.
1005000	1006000	Drunami, how was your gaming week?
1006000	1011000	Well, not too eventful. I've been leveling a warrior in World of Warcraft.
1012000	1015000	It's pretty good. I can see where a lot of people say they're Imba,
1016000	1020000	but I haven't really got past 18, so that remains to be seen.
1021000	1024000	I've also been trying to finish Xenosaga episode one,
1025000	1026000	or rather, watching it.
1027000	1031000	I admit, I like it even though it's very, very long on cutscenes,
1032000	1034000	and the battle system is sort of frustrating,
1034000	1037000	but it's a good game, a very deep story.
1038000	1040000	Other than that, I haven't really been doing much in the way of gaming.
1041000	1042000	All right.
1043000	1045000	Chris, anything you want to share with how your gaming week's been going?
1046000	1047000	Well, you remembered me this time.
1048000	1050000	I did. I'm sorry. How could I forget? You brought me cake.
1051000	1052000	Meghan says that you're a skanky, skanky hoe bag.
1053000	1055000	Yeah, I know. No, no, she said Rob is.
1056000	1057000	Hey, why am I a skanky hoe bag?
1058000	1060000	That's her way of saying she loves you.
1061000	1061000	Oh, okay.
1061000	1065000	Hugs and kisses and smoothies to you, sweetie.
1066000	1071000	Okay, aside from Sins 2, I got Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance and Baldur's Gate 2 Dark Alliance.
1072000	1076000	I found them on Amazon for each, like, 60 bucks, but I got them new.
1077000	1078000	Did it have a monkey on the cover?
1079000	1080000	No, it didn't. Shut up.
1081000	1082000	I've been playing both of those because I never got to finish both of them.
1083000	1084000	Go for the eyes.
1085000	1087000	So, yeah. I like it.
1088000	1089000	That was my gaming week.
1089000	1091000	All right. Right on.
1092000	1094000	And I burned my fingernail, lighting your candles.
1099000	1102000	Okay, well, I guess now that everybody, now, I didn't miss anyone this week.
1103000	1104000	Yes, we're good? All right.
1105000	1107000	I guess we can start, I missed the ferret. My bad.
1108000	1110000	I guess we can get into some housekeeping news tonight.
1111000	1113000	First, if you haven't noticed, it is our 200th episode.
1114000	1116000	We're cheating the number a little bit.
1116000	1121000	This isn't our 200th podcast, per se, but it's probably well over our 100th regular podcast.
1122000	1130000	But the deal is that we started as a live 365 station back in May of 2002 with our first show airing June 23, 2002.
1131000	1132000	It was our first live show.
1133000	1136000	And when we started Orange Launch Radio, originally the concept was we're going to be a DDR station.
1137000	1138000	We're going to be about Bomani games.
1139000	1142000	And we wanted to be the station that was like, we don't want to just talk about the Bomani news,
1142000	1147000	but we're going to be like that group of people that's at the diner after playing,
1148000	1151000	you know, meeting up at the arcade for a night or like a tournament after DDR tournament
1152000	1155000	and just sitting around talking shit, talking about DDR, but talking shit and talking about games as well.
1156000	1162000	And of course, over the years, we were one of the first internet broadcasts to get on the podcasting bandwagon
1163000	1167000	with the first Orange Launch Radio To Go edition debuting in January of 2005.
1168000	1170000	Keep in mind iTunes didn't support podcasts until June of 2005,
1170000	1175000	so we were pretty lucky in discovering that technology pretty early and we started doing a special show there.
1176000	1181000	And then in January of this year, 2006, we combined our already existing live show and our podcast effort into this,
1182000	1187000	our live and podcast show, which runs live every Sunday night and then is podcasted to the world twice a week.
1188000	1191000	So we think we're justified in the 200 number because this is about the 200th regular week
1192000	1194000	we've been putting out some type of gaming-related programming out there.
1195000	1197000	Not to mention all the live shows that we've done, special shows and fuck-off shows.
1197000	1200000	Exactly. We've been live at E3. We were live at Arena this year for E3.
1201000	1205000	We were live at the B3 DDR tournament. We were live at a Scandia tournament.
1206000	1209000	Weren't we live at Milpitas once, Golfland for DDR tournament?
1210000	1214000	I think we were. Just a bunch of crazy shit we've been doing throughout the years with DDR community.
1215000	1219000	And now, general gaming as well. We know our fan base has now expanded past just those who are into music games.
1220000	1222000	And of course, we'll never forget our love of music games. We always have plenty of news.
1222000	1226000	Of course, we have the DDR sneak peeks tonight. I think that just further goes to show that.
1227000	1228000	We haven't forgotten our roots.
1229000	1232000	Konami finally noticed us like two months ago. It's kind of amazing. So now we have all of that.
1233000	1238000	So it's great. We've been so thankful to all the success we've had over the past 200 episodes.
1239000	1240000	And we don't plan on quitting anytime soon.
1241000	1243000	We did also break the Akira Yamaoka tracks.
1244000	1248000	That's right. That was one big thing. That was one big thing was that we had a new Akira track that we were playing on the show.
1248000	1251000	That was a big thing for us. We interviewed some DDR artists last year. It was pretty awesome.
1252000	1257000	So lots of accomplishments. It's really all thanks to you guys in the chat room and the fans. You guys are just awesome.
1258000	1263000	But anyway, we're going to save some of the crying and the tears for later in the show because we have a little surprise towards the end.
1264000	1265000	So we'll do that a little later.
1266000	1271000	For now, the other housekeeping. Now, this isn't such a happy note that we have to get into, but this shit happens.
1272000	1276000	Part of what we do at Orange Lounge Radio is that we're not afraid to report on things when we hear about it.
1276000	1281000	If we sense that there's a bit of legitimacy to a news story, we're going to run with it.
1282000	1284000	I think we're kind of starting to turn into at least my vision.
1285000	1289000	And I think the vision Dark Soccer and Loki have as well is that we want to be like an ain't it cool news of gaming.
1290000	1293000	We're not afraid to run the rumors when we sense there's some bit of legitimacy to them.
1294000	1297000	And we want to scoop the big, big media reports and things of that nature.
1298000	1301000	But unfortunately, once in a while, something's going to happen that causes us to be wrong.
1302000	1303000	And unfortunately, this time it happens to be a big one.
1303000	1307000	And this was a story that was picked up on a lot of news sites that we ran. Loki, what happened?
1308000	1309000	And this isn't really our fault.
1310000	1311000	No, it's not.
1312000	1315000	But you guys have to understand, this is what's going to happen when we do this.
1316000	1318000	Ain't it cool news right all the time? Hell no they're not.
1319000	1321000	And stuff changes all the time.
1322000	1324000	It's just like when we report dates and stuff. Dates change all the time.
1325000	1329000	But anyways, this is about the Phantasy Star Universe online subscription fees.
1329000	1335000	Before we reported that the Xbox 360 version would be free and the Playstation 2 and PC would be pay.
1336000	1342000	Well, Sega went back on what they decided to do and they're deciding to charge for the online service.
1343000	1344000	And here is exactly why they're doing it.
1345000	1348000	And this is straight from an email from our sales rep from Sega.
1349000	1355000	It says, anyways, I just wanted to update you on what's going on regarding the subscription service we have with Phantasy Star Universe.
1355000	1361000	As you know, the game will have an extensive 40 hour single player mode as well as online questing mode that allows players to create a character,
1362000	1365000	customize that character and meet up with other players to complete quests online.
1366000	1372000	The single player portion is separate from the online mode and it will work as normal on Playstation 2, Xbox 360 and PC.
1373000	1375000	The online mode, however, is a bit different.
1376000	1379000	To play online, the user will have to create an account with Sega and pay a monthly fee of $9.99.
1380000	1383000	This will be required for all versions of the game, including the 360 version.
1383000	1388000	Previously, we had thought the 360 version would not have a fee due to the Xbox Live fees.
1389000	1390000	That has since changed.
1391000	1396000	The good news is, this is nothing new for Phantasy Star Universe in that all online versions of Phantasy Star have had this fee in the past
1397000	1400000	and that even the last Xbox version which played over live.
1401000	1406000	Also, we're trying to implement a 14 day free trial for the Playstation 2 version.
1407000	1411000	Our Japanese dev team has found that this free trial could lead to certain types of cheating
1411000	1417000	and now there's a chance that that free trial will not be included in the Playstation 2 version.
1418000	1420000	I will update you as I get final word on this.
1421000	1425000	Regarding the 360 version, Xbox Live prevents us from doing any type of free trial.
1426000	1434000	However, the good news is that we have a marketplace demo that will allow users to get a small taste of the offline and online portions of the game.
1435000	1439000	It says I know subscription fees are not a very common thing for the console games and that's why I wanted to inform you of this.
1439000	1448000	Well, unfortunate, but Sega told us one thing and then told us another, but as you can understand, you know they were considering it.
1449000	1455000	They were considering it and I think what it comes down to is that they found out they can charge for it and so they went ahead and did it.
1456000	1461000	A lot of negative feedback from chat, people saying they're not going to get the game now because they don't pay for MMOs monthly.
1462000	1466000	I'm with them on that. I was going to buy the game and to be honest, I'm not really interested anymore.
1466000	1470000	I'm interested in the marketplace demo. I'm going to make my decision solely based off the demo.
1471000	1477000	I am encouraged that at least the demo they're going to put on marketplace will support on and offline and that will be the decision maker for me.
1478000	1482000	I'll pay for MMOs. I paid for World of Warcraft. I paid for Final Fantasy XI. I'm not against paying for MMOs.
1483000	1486000	It's got to be good and I want to try it before I buy it.
1487000	1494000	Here's the thing I don't understand about the MMOs is they have this infrastructure for these MMOs on live supposedly, but yet no one's really using it.
1494000	1498000	Same with Final Fantasy XI, you have to pay for online service.
1499000	1504000	I wish there was an MMO that I didn't have to pay for the online portion because that's why I don't buy the games.
1505000	1506000	I don't have Guild Wars.
1507000	1514000	They don't have Guild Wars on the 360. That's why I don't play MMOs on the 360 because I don't have the time to dedicate to play it regularly.
1515000	1518000	I don't want to pay this extra monthly fee because I know I'm not going to use it.
1518000	1524000	Whereas with Phantasy Star I figured, okay, I get to buy it and I can play online whenever I want. Awesome! That sold it for me.
1525000	1531000	But now this news, right when I saw it I was like, fuck! I knew this was something that was going to possibly happen.
1532000	1539000	Not a huge surprise since they've been charging all the time, but whatever. Life goes on I guess.
1540000	1543000	Kind of unfortunate. Jamie, I'm really curious about your thoughts because you're a big Phantasy Star supporter.
1543000	1548000	I imagine you're probably going to play this anyway, but what do you think about all this back and forth, paying, no paying stuff?
1549000	1555000	I think half of it is that they're charging because, well, first of all they're in the business to make money, so why shouldn't they charge?
1556000	1561000	But regardless, and actually Ronma made this point in the chat room, it's still one of the cheapest MMOs you can play.
1561000	1573000	I think that if charging the fee might lead to better service, give them more money for development into the game to expand it later on, that's my hope.
1574000	1578000	But I really don't care because I was going to play it anyway.
1579000	1584000	I figured if you want to play something bad enough, no price should keep you from enjoying it.
1584000	1591000	Alright, well we'll see. We encourage your emails if you want to give us some feedback on this. Mailbag at orangelandtrader.com.
1592000	1596000	I imagine some people might be kind of pissed at us for reporting the news before, but you know what guys?
1597000	1600000	We had certainly a big reason to believe it was true because Sega told us.
1601000	1611000	If you are unhappy with that, sorry. I guess you can stick to getting press releases and things when everybody else gets them and won't know any news beforehand.
1611000	1616000	But to Loki's credit, a lot of the rest of that story has turned out to be right on.
1617000	1626000	When it comes to a lot of the stories about the Wii that we're going to get into tonight and the GT steering wheel and some of the other things that you reported in that story are coming true.
1626000	1646000	We can't predict the future. If they go and change what their plan is for something, we're not going to know. It's up to them. So if they decide to go back on what they want to charge, we can't be right all the time when it comes to them changing stuff.
1646000	1655000	As we mentioned, there was a lot of big news this week about this little system coming out from Nintendo called Wii.
1656000	1662000	We're dedicating just about the rest of the segment to talk about this because there was so much news that came with the Wii.
1662000	1675000	So of course if you've been living in a cave or for some reason you only get your gaming news from OLR, which is kind of cool I guess, here's the deal. The Wii is coming out on November 19th and it's coming out for a price of $250.
1676000	1677000	$249.99.
1678000	1689000	With after-tax it's going to be over $250. It's going to be packaged with Wii Sports. Controllers will be sold separately. The Wiimote, which is the official name for it it sounds like, the Wiimote is going to be what?
1689000	1691000	The remote and nunchuck.
1692000	1698000	The Wiimote is going to be $40 and the nunchuck is going to be $20. That was everything that was announced at the press conference.
1699000	1709000	Pretty much the price point it looks like right now is the remote is going to be $39.99 whereas the attachments are going to be $19.99.
1710000	1712000	Who called the price? That would be me.
1712000	1723000	Good job. Now a lot of people are saying the controllers are too damn expensive. But I didn't, I mean okay because when you consider it's the nunchuck and the controller it's going to be about $60.
1724000	1729000	You don't have to buy the nunchuck. You do not have to have it. A lot of games do not use it unless it's like a first person shooter.
1730000	1733000	Plus I do believe isn't a wireless Xbox 360 controller $49?
1733000	1741000	It's $49.99 and that's not even with the rechargeable, granted the Wii does not have a rechargeable battery pack at least as far as I'm aware.
1742000	1747000	2 AA's but it does last quite a long time apparently and so I don't know.
1748000	1755000	I'm not trying to knock Xbox 360's price at all. I'm just saying you know Nintendo doesn't see that but a lot of people were very disappointed in the price that they heard.
1756000	1761000	And I thought it was kind of like well isn't that what kind of everyone was expecting? I guess some people have their sights on $200.
1761000	1766000	But I don't know I want to say I swear to God I said on this show previously I bet you anything Wii Sports is a pack-in game.
1767000	1770000	And people were telling me no because they haven't done a pack-in game in years.
1771000	1776000	No Wii Sports is like it's not gamey enough to be a game but it's good enough to be a pack-in game.
1777000	1779000	It's just like world class track meet. That's exactly what it is to me. It's world class track meet.
1780000	1784000	It's also something that's very simple that will teach you how to use the controller and stuff like that.
1785000	1788000	Exactly. Alright well we have plenty of Wii news all around the table tonight so.
1788000	1794000	Well there is a bit more about Wii Sports. Again it is going to be bundled in with the Wii at release.
1795000	1804000	But there's been suggestions especially actually it states that for EGM that it was going to support over 30 different games.
1805000	1809000	But the official ones listed are tennis, baseball, golf, bowling and boxing.
1809000	1820000	And it's all pretty much the same simple thing. Like for anyone who watched the press release it's pretty much the same type style of thing that you saw in the press release.
1821000	1822000	Okay.
1823000	1824000	I guess bowling is a sport.
1825000	1826000	Bowling will be kind of fun.
1827000	1828000	I wonder if it will have curling.
1829000	1832000	Tennis wasn't bad but again I bet baseball will be a lot of fun with multiple people.
1832000	1838000	And you know I think the concept and the reason why the remote costs so much and watching the Wii press event and everything.
1839000	1846000	I think the concept is you're going to build your personality on your Wii remote thing and you want to take it to other places right?
1847000	1859000	Well actually it's stating that in particular for Wii Sports is that you're going to use your I guess the Wii caricature to play in the games that you can actually play versus people that will personalize the game for you.
1859000	1864000	So I don't think that Nintendo wants you to buy four Wiimotes for your household.
1865000	1871000	They want you and all three of your friends to buy Wiis and then you bring your Wiimote with you like you bring your iPod with you everywhere to share music.
1872000	1875000	You're going to bring your Wiimote and I guess I'm also being corrected in chat that's not the real name.
1876000	1878000	It's going to be the Wii remote but I don't care it's a Wii remote or Wiimote.
1879000	1880000	I still like Wecon.
1881000	1882000	I think they use Wiimote actually.
1883000	1885000	I swear I heard in that press conference somebody say Wiimote but whatever it doesn't matter.
1885000	1892000	So whatever that thing is the thing you're going to take the thing with you to other people's houses and then you know your characters on there ready to go.
1893000	1900000	Didn't we already reveal on the show previously in some news article that it had some type of storage on the actual remote itself.
1901000	1907000	So it probably saves basic stats and things like you know you go to your friend's house and oh hey you're four and two in baseball right now let's play you know.
1908000	1909000	Sort of be like bringing your memory card with you.
1910000	1911000	Or your DS.
1911000	1915000	Yeah I think that's exactly what it is so I don't know.
1916000	1922000	Anyways well some other interesting things about the Wii in Japan of course which was the first news that we got about the Wii.
1923000	1932000	It's going to be launching for 25,000 yen and what's kind of interesting though is they are not getting the pack in for Wii Sports.
1932000	1942000	That is separate you have to buy that separately and that's actually going to cost around 3,800 actually I'm sorry 3,800 yen is going to be the price of the remote.
1943000	1953000	1,800 for the nunchaku attachment and 1,800 for the classic controller which also by the way $19.99 for the classic controller in the United States.
1954000	1960000	Wii Sports though is going to be a pretty inexpensive game so that should be pretty interesting.
1960000	1968000	One of the other games I saw in there which is really cool Wii Play which is going to be for people that saw the E3 tech demos and stuff like the shooting demo.
1969000	1970000	Duck Hunt?
1971000	1974000	Yeah I like the Duck Hunt game those are in Wii Play some of them so that's kind of cool.
1975000	1980000	Hopefully we'll get in the states I know that UK is getting and stuff like that but should be interesting.
1981000	1985000	Camden in our chat room is making a little play on the whole me thing and put me a moto.
1985000	1995000	You remember when you saw the E3 demo with all four of them playing and the little heads were on the bodies and they looked like Miyamoto and everything?
1996000	2000000	That was it because they had made their things on the me now it all makes sense so that's kind of interesting.
2001000	2004000	I just want to ask a quick question.
2005000	2010000	Why do you think Japan is not getting Wii Sports? Why do you think they opted not to do that and do a cheaper bundle instead without it?
2010000	2016000	Just for economical reasons I actually stand a chance of making more money having the game separate.
2017000	2024000	Also Japan is getting theirs on December 2nd which is surprising because they're not the first ones to launch with the Wii the United States is. Interesting.
2025000	2026000	We're loved.
2027000	2028000	Heart Nintendo.
2028000	2042000	Anyway as far as speaking of the Nintendo love this is in UK news. The Wii is going to retail for 249 euros which is 179 pounds in the UK.
2043000	2046000	Also with it will be about 20 release games.
2046000	2064000	It's Wii Play, Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess and some third party games like Red Steel, Need for Speed Carbon, Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam, Pixar's Cars and Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz.
2065000	2066000	That sounds kind of fun.
2067000	2070000	Also it will be bundled with Wii Sports as well.
2070000	2077000	It will come with one Wii Remote, one Nunchuk and again Wii Sports.
2078000	2080000	I think it's funny that they're getting the...
2081000	2085000	I think it's interesting that Europe is not getting the shaft for once with the release time.
2086000	2092000	I mean sure we're beating them to it but to be ahead of Japan that's weird to me that Japan isn't getting this thing until December.
2093000	2094000	That is so weird to me.
2095000	2098000	Well actually it says that the European release date is the 8th of December.
2098000	2100000	Oh my bad. I thought it was before. I'm sorry.
2101000	2104000	My bad, my bad. Okay so Europe did get the shaft. Sorry guys.
2105000	2106000	It's not that bad.
2107000	2110000	It's not as bad as the usual Nintendo shaft. It's not as bad so I guess there's that.
2111000	2114000	And I understand why they're doing it because they're launching so many units in the United States.
2115000	2119000	They've got to catch up, make sure they have enough for it to launch in the other territories.
2119000	2128000	Well it's also going to of course, we'll be going into a little bit more about this later, of course we'll have the Wii channel menu and a pretty interesting interface.
2129000	2133000	Alright. Well if you want to spin your globe all the way around and take a look at Australia.
2134000	2136000	Australia's launch looks pretty comparable to what Europe's getting.
2137000	2140000	The console's going to launch there on December 7th, 2006.
2141000	2145000	The retail price will be $399.95 but that's Australian.
2145000	2149000	And then they're also going to have Wii Sports as their pack-in game.
2150000	2154000	And of course all the other good stuff you've been hearing about with the interface and everything.
2155000	2158000	Nothing too different there. But Australia's not being left out of the worldwide launch.
2159000	2167000	So it looks like Nintendo has this worldwide launch thing down where Sony with their whole worldwide means Japan and the U.S. only might need to...
2168000	2172000	Sony just makes it easy to bash on them. I really don't want to.
2172000	2175000	Well my question for Nintendo is what about Africa?
2176000	2178000	Where is that only the domain of Sony now?
2179000	2180000	Africa.
2181000	2183000	Well maybe we'll hear something on that later, I don't know.
2184000	2191000	We all know that Mr. Kuragis meets crayons and wears a helmet so we can't be too upset at him.
2192000	2197000	I will be curious to see again, I think like most PlayStation consoles, and I don't want to get off topic too much,
2197000	2202000	but like most PlayStation consoles, I don't think we'll truly be able to judge the PlayStation 3 until this time next year.
2203000	2207000	I really don't think we're going to start seeing the big guns until then, but whatever.
2208000	2210000	I guess it's all about launch now. Now, now, now. Especially in this internet age.
2211000	2213000	I mean how fast did people want their information on that Wii launch?
2214000	2220000	Now, now, now. People tuning into June video streams thinking they were current because they had to have it now, now, now
2221000	2223000	and something gets dug and then everybody believes it. It's crazy!
2223000	2226000	The internet has fucked things up! Totally!
2227000	2230000	Well, at least we were right about the launch date. We said soon.
2231000	2232000	Yeah, we did say soon. We did.
2233000	2236000	I did say November. I gave you a couple weeks in November.
2237000	2240000	Meg Z got an exact date. I think I should point that out.
2241000	2243000	I saw her call that on her live journal. That was cool.
2244000	2245000	She was really, really happy about that.
2245000	2253000	I do want to point out, Loki, in your thing you did on 198, you were one of the first people to say, hey, Nintendo is debating launching after Sony.
2254000	2258000	Because most people, when they were guessing the launch date, were guessing things before the 17th.
2259000	2261000	You were one of the first people to say they are thinking about doing it after.
2262000	2266000	To be honest, all the dates in our system that we had, all the launch dates were on the 15th of November.
2267000	2272000	And I was like, that's got to be a to be announced date because there's no way that they would launch it at the same time as Sony.
2272000	2275000	And here I was wrong the whole time. It was right in front of my face.
2276000	2281000	But, whatever. Who cares? It's just a fun little game until the system actually launches.
2282000	2287000	Rama in our chat regarding the Wii launch in Africa says, fuck them, send Africa refurbished N64s.
2288000	2292000	That's not nice. Have Ellen give out some Wiis.
2293000	2294000	Have Ellen give out some Wiis to Africa.
2295000	2295000	I hate Ellen.
2296000	2299000	We'll send Sudan Summers there with food for the starving children and Wiis.
2299000	2303000	You guys, she gave away to a blind guy. What the hell is he going to do with that?
2304000	2310000	There's lots of areas to Africa and I'm sure some of them are waiting and willing for their Wiis. They want it.
2311000	2319000	I actually did go searching for the date. I could not find it, but I would imagine given that the majority of the world is getting theirs in December, theirs is probably close to the same time.
2320000	2324000	If not, then early next year. I'm sure you will have your Wiis soon enough, Africa.
2324000	2333000	As we mentioned before, I believe we talked about this, it came out that the Wii will not support DVD playback.
2334000	2341000	What we were told, of course, before is that they're going to have an add-on little thing for it, kind of like the Xbox did where you'd be able to play DVDs.
2342000	2344000	Well, they've opted on not doing that at all.
2345000	2351000	In fact, it says Nintendo of America's Vice President of Marketing and Corporate Affairs Perrin Kaplan confirmed to IGN,
2351000	2357000	Wii today, that its forthcoming Wii console will not play Hollywood DVD movies.
2358000	2365000	The decision to remove the functionality was made in order to deliver the machine at cheaper costs because most people today already own DVD players.
2366000	2371000	And to be honest, it makes perfect sense. The GameCube didn't play DVDs and I wasn't sad about it, so who cares?
2372000	2378000	You know what's interesting about this? This is a direct opposite philosophy to what Sony is doing, if you think about it, right?
2378000	2386000	Because Sony is saying, oh no, you need Blu-ray. We need to put Blu-ray in here because you need your Blu-ray movie playback, because you need to see your movies in 1080.
2387000	2389000	You need to do this. Isn't it kind of interesting?
2390000	2400000	You know what, I think that's very smart because their whole point is gameplay. Making games. Not making, oh, we do all this other crap too.
2401000	2402000	Well, hold on though.
2403000	2405000	How many of us in this room own a DVD player?
2405000	2415000	Well, we all do. I use my Xbox 360, really. But hold on, hold on though, and I don't want to spoil the interface story that's coming up, but there are things that are in the interface that aren't only strictly games, right?
2416000	2417000	So there's a little something extra.
2418000	2422000	That is true, but I still think that the focus is on games and should stay that way.
2423000	2426000	That's why I think that Sony is shooting themselves in the balls.
2426000	2435000	I think it's more of a cost of technology thing, where it's like, why pay for the DVD player to be in there? Maybe these other little frills we can add on the technology we already have, but why pay to have the DVD stuff in there?
2436000	2443000	If you want to know who to blame for DVD playback not being in there, it's pretty much Hollywood anyways, because you have to license the DVD playback.
2444000	2448000	Listen, I didn't catch this. Why did Nintendo tell you there was going to be a dongle and now they didn't?
2448000	2457000	That's because of the licensing for DVD playback. You have to pay for licensing fees, and that's why they charge for that stuff, because it covers the cost of licensing. That's why Xbox did the same thing.
2458000	2462000	It's not because it can't. It's just because, well, you know, it's just not going to. I got you. I got you.
2463000	2467000	Well, as far as... we are just so Wii-centric today, aren't we?
2468000	2469000	Well, for this part...
2470000	2475000	It's the hugest thing in gaming right now. When we get into Part B, we'll have some non-Wii stuff, but we've got to get this out.
2475000	2478000	I just said that so that I could use Wii-centric in a sentence.
2479000	2480000	Cute.
2481000	2491000	Regarding more Wii games, actually they have announced a Resident Evil game for the Wii titled Biohazard Umbrella Chronicles.
2492000	2501000	It's produced by Masachika Kawata, who was also the one who ported RE4 to PlayStation 2.
2501000	2505000	I have to make this crack. Resident Evil.
2506000	2507000	Resident Evil!
2508000	2509000	Go to hell!
2510000	2512000	And take your toilet paper joke book with you.
2513000	2514000	It survived for this long.
2515000	2517000	Resident Evil. God.
2518000	2527000	Well, Capcom was saying that they were supposed to combine the gaming experience and atmosphere, but involve the Wii control system with it.
2527000	2536000	They're still not leaving any details. It's still saying it's an action game, still is going to use the Wii-con, but they're not really giving any more detail.
2537000	2546000	However, another game that we did get some detail on was Forever Blue, which is a diving game that will be coming out for Wii.
2547000	2551000	That sounds interesting. I love those little quirky games.
2551000	2560000	Resident Evil 4 was badass on the GameCube and was really the last kick in the butt that system had in the right direction.
2561000	2565000	What do you think? Is Resident Evil Wii going to be like, holy crap, Nintendo's not just cutesy things?
2566000	2568000	I have a feeling it's going to do that.
2568000	2580000	There's also another game that was mentioned, Hajime Tano Wii, which means starting out with Wii. It's supposed to be one of the launch titles, and it's supposed to be a bunch of mini-games with the Duck Hunt.
2581000	2583000	Are you guys getting used to that name now? Wii?
2584000	2585000	I think it's cute.
2586000	2589000	I don't know. I think it's the right thing. I think Nintendo's making a lot of smart decisions here. I'll get into it later.
2590000	2591000	What was it that I said months ago?
2592000	2592000	What?
2592000	2604000	The whole point of advertising. When you come up with a name for something, you need something memorable, something that people are going to talk about, something simple, and it fits all three.
2605000	2616000	And boy, the internet would not shut up about Wii. Check any game blog or major gaming site or little gaming site, and it was Wii Wii Wii, unless it was an Xbox or Sony site. It was all about the Wii all this week.
2617000	2620000	There is rarely such a thing as bad press. I always say rarely, not ever.
2620000	2621000	You know, look at Sony and E3.
2622000	2629000	You get confused about how many people are like, ooh, what's that, or that sounds so weird, let me check it out. I'm curious now. Ooh, Wii.
2630000	2631000	Interesting. Interesting.
2632000	2636000	When you are having fun, you refer to yourself and some other people. Wii.
2637000	2646000	Interesting. All right. Well, one game I'm sure we're all going to have a lot of fun with on the Wii is the Twilight Princess, Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess, which, by the way, was delayed a little bit on GameCube.
2646000	2651000	It's not coming out the exact same day as Wii Link. It's coming out, what, December something.
2652000	2654000	I'm sure Chatham is going to yell it out.
2655000	2659000	I want to say December 8th for some reason. It sticks out of my mind. I don't know why. Maybe that's because it was the Europe launch. I don't know.
2660000	2667000	But anyway, what's interesting is that there's a pretty big difference between the GameCube version and the Wii version of Twilight Princess, and that is how Link is holding his sword.
2667000	2682000	Miyamoto stated that Link was initially supposed to have a left-handed sword in the Wii version of Twilight Princess, but he has that in the GameCube version, and they changed it so that he uses a sword in the right hand on the Wii because of the fact that most people are right-handed.
2683000	2692000	Well, I always thought it was very strange having Link be left-handed anyway, because isn't it in Japan it's sort of a thing where a lot of parents will train their children to be right-handed?
2692000	2698000	Being left-handed is very, I guess, considered not very normal.
2699000	2701000	Chat room's all yelling December 11th, by the way. Thank you, chat room.
2702000	2705000	Why can't they make Tingle less gay, then? If they can teach Link to use the other hand.
2706000	2711000	Hey, Tingle ain't coming out here. I can say this because I think on gaygamer.net I want to say was the site.
2712000	2715000	They're starting a petition right now to get Tingle out over here because right now it's not planned for release over here.
2715000	2726000	The Tingle Adventure, that uber-gay guy in the, well at least we all think he is, in that GameCube Four Swords Adventures.
2727000	2732000	He flies by on a balloon and goes, ooh, ooh, and drops rupees on you.
2733000	2734000	Well, he was actually in Wind Waker.
2735000	2737000	Oh, that's right. All right, thank you. I just remember him from Four Swords.
2738000	2741000	I'm going to have to import that because I like, um, yeah.
2741000	2744000	You like to feel a little Tingle?
2745000	2748000	No, I just like, I like the gay.
2749000	2752000	Anyway, speaking of, no, I'm sorry, not speaking.
2753000	2758000	The interface for the Wii, we've got some very interesting things going on.
2758000	2771000	There is, excuse me, as I die over here, there is going to be, it's actually based on Opera for their web browser.
2772000	2779000	There's a weather channel, a news channel, and then there's one called Mii Channel, M-I-I for those who haven't got the joke yet.
2779000	2789000	With the Mii Channel, you can use it to customize your avatar, and also your avatar will show up in the various demos.
2790000	2799000	You can actually store everything on your Wii Remote, so you will actually be taking your Wii Remote to other people's houses and play.
2799000	2812000	Which I've been listening to some other podcasts kind of, you know, not getting that part of it, and I'm just kind of thinking, I'm like, that's the whole trick.
2813000	2817000	It's not that you're going to have four controllers in your own house, it's that everybody's going to have their own controller.
2818000	2823000	The controller is going to be like the, you know, the thing that defines me, and then the Wii is just the box you play the games on.
2823000	2829000	And also the characters, you don't actually have to play as them, they can also populate, you know, say other games, like Animal Crossing or something like that.
2830000	2838000	Where you can create, you know, characters, like for example, they showed the demo for, where they're creating Samuel L. Jackson.
2838000	2857000	There actually, if anyone is interested, there are videos up on Eurogamer.net, linked over from Eurogamer TV, that give demonstrations of how these various screens and channels are going to work on the Wii.
2858000	2859000	So I recommend checking those out.
2860000	2861000	Very cool. And I know I saw some on Wii.com too.
2862000	2862000	Oh yeah.
2863000	2863000	I have some good stuff too.
2863000	2869000	I want to point out this comment, and I know I'm not supposed to say these words because they were banned, but it's a funny comment.
2870000	2878000	Sayoran108 in our chatroom says, Tingle gets more guys than G4.
2879000	2880000	Oh!
2881000	2882000	In regards to Tingle.
2883000	2884000	Eww.
2884000	2895000	Anyways, alright. As Jamie mentioned earlier, there's a brand new Wii game, which kind of, I guess, roughly translates to My First Wii.
2896000	2898000	And the game's actually going to be bundled with a Wiimote.
2899000	2904000	And it will be, yes, My First Wii. Everybody poops!
2905000	2908000	No, no, that's translated that wrong. This is starting with Wii.
2909000	2910000	Starting with Wii.
2910000	2913000	Starting with Wii, and then you go to poo.
2914000	2929000	So, yeah, it's going to be bundled together with 4800 yen, making it cheaper than a standard controller, which would be 5800 yen.
2929000	2946000	So that's actually kind of cool. And it's set for the Japanese release on December 2nd, and will include, of course, minigames designed to make players familiar with the Wii remote controls, including pinball, table hockey, and pool.
2946000	2959000	Simple point-and-click shooting games, and other games that are modeled after the demos shown at E3, including a minigame where you move your Mii caricature around a city block.
2960000	2962000	So, interesting.
2963000	2973000	Now, one thing that the Wii is going to be able to do that is kind of interesting, and it's kind of interesting that Xbox 360 doesn't do this, and I don't know if PlayStation has plans to do this, but that's surfing the web.
2973000	2981000	And I can see where Xbox 360 doesn't do this, because they want you to go use Windows on your PC to go surf the internet, but Nintendo, they don't have a PC stake, so they say,
2982000	2986000	fuck that, you're going to surf the web on our system, and they're going to use the Opera browser to do it.
2987000	2999000	But here's the thing, they said during the press conference that users will be downloading the Opera browser with Wii Points, which is kind of their version of money into points into being able to buy stuff on their thing.
2999000	3006000	But the nice thing about it is that actually they're not going to charge for the browser until June of next year.
3007000	3014000	No idea why they're doing it that way. I thought at first when I read this, this meant that the browser wasn't going to be out until June of next year, but that's not what the internet seems to be reporting right now.
3015000	3019000	It seems to be saying that, yeah, the Opera browser will be there, and you can download it free, but in June of next year you're going to have to pay for it.
3020000	3023000	So, I guess a bonus incentive to early adopters of the Wii?
3023000	3034000	I guess. The other thing too is, I mean, it's probably not that expensive to develop the Opera browser, and since it's normally free anyways, that's probably why they're charging after.
3035000	3039000	It's kind of like the whole thing that they did with Texas Hold'em, where it's free for four years.
3040000	3043000	Yeah, but Texas Hold'em was free for two days. This is going to be free for about seven months.
3044000	3048000	Well, you know, not a lot of people are going to be really jumping to download the browser.
3048000	3057000	Because, I mean, if you think about it, to browse the internet, you've really got to have a wireless setup and all that stuff for the Wii.
3058000	3063000	Well, wait, but isn't the Wii supposed to have the wireless thing built into it, just like your DS, so that all you have to have is a wireless router in your house and it'll go?
3064000	3066000	Exactly, but still though, not a lot of people have that, I would think.
3067000	3069000	Do you think people without wireless internet are going to be screwed, or do you think there will be a dongle?
3070000	3072000	No, there's going to be a USB type of thing.
3073000	3074000	Same with the DS.
3075000	3076000	That's what I figured.
3076000	3080000	Well, speaking of things that are screwed up, Monkey Ball.
3081000	3090000	Okay, Monkey Ball is just one of those crazy games that's out there, and of course, as everyone knows by now, there is Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz that will be out on the Wii.
3091000	3095000	They're introducing two new characters, one called Yanyan and one called Doctor.
3095000	3107000	Yanyan is a female monkey, and Yanyan is an older monkey with a past steeped in mystery due to his acute case of amnesia.
3108000	3109000	Is his name Doctor Sayus?
3110000	3111000	It just says Doctor.
3112000	3117000	In my head, I'm a Doctor Who fan girl, so every time I see Doctor, I think, David Tennant? No!
3118000	3121000	Now I have this image of David Tennant dressed as a monkey in my head. I can't.
3122000	3123000	And now I need to wash my brain.
3123000	3125000	David Tennant's hot, but anyway.
3126000	3127000	Okie dokie.
3127000	3128000	So is Billy Piper.
3129000	3130000	Back to the story.
3131000	3135000	There's also, each of these characters are going to have different strengths and weaknesses.
3136000	3144000	Things that affect acceleration, speed, jumping, also the weight and size of the ball that they are in is going to affect how it's played.
3144000	3154000	Actually, you use the ball in different ways. You can flick the remote, you can press a button, different things that you do with the remote are going to affect how the balls move.
3155000	3162000	And there's also a bunch of mini games. It will be out on December 2nd in Japan.
3163000	3168000	Sorry, the grade schooler in me is using the Wii to make your balls move. It's just too much for me.
3169000	3169000	Too much for me.
3170000	3172000	It will be a launch game in all territories.
3172000	3174000	I just want to say some chat comments real quick.
3175000	3176000	Pooeater on the Opera story in our chat room says,
3177000	3181000	Why would you want the internet on your console which has to run from your computer's internet connection?
3182000	3186000	I don't know. There's something to be said about multiple browser windows. Maybe mom wants one browsing window and you want one. I don't know.
3187000	3191000	And also, I mean browsing from your couch and porn! Come on!
3192000	3193000	Oh, I can't wait to put porn on my Wii.
3194000	3199000	Ravenstolphin wanted to correct me and say that PlayStation 3 does indeed have a browser in it. Thank you. I couldn't remember.
3199000	3203000	I figured as much because PSP has one, but I couldn't remember for sure.
3204000	3214000	Anyway, speaking of the browser, they are testing the online service, or I should say it's rumored that they are beta testing the online service right now.
3215000	3221000	And this, I don't know how reputable this is, but this is according to a poster on the MacRumors forum.
3222000	3223000	I have problems with that right there.
3223000	3241000	Anyways, who has fairly reputable history when it comes to Nintendo related information, saying that the beta test is running from September 18th until October 23rd, and the test will be covering the Wii Connect 24, Virtual Console, and other online features.
3241000	3252000	Right. Okay, so they're beta testing the online service. Great. That's something that they need to do. Since the console is coming out pretty soon.
3253000	3254000	Yay for MacMan.
3255000	3256000	What?
3257000	3259000	I'm the only Mac fangirl in the house, so I have a Mac.
3260000	3261000	No, that's not true. I like Macs. I have a Mac.
3262000	3264000	I'm getting my, um, did you see the 24-inch iMacs?
3265000	3267000	The bigger the better.
3268000	3269000	Why do you need them that big?
3269000	3270000	For art?
3271000	3274000	I'm being told that that's not a rumor and that's the truth, apparently.
3275000	3278000	They're the 24-inch widescreen iMac.
3279000	3280000	Are you compensating for something?
3281000	3282000	No, I have no.
3283000	3285000	My internet penis knows no bounds.
3286000	3295000	Moving on, another question that still is up for debate right now, we have not really gotten a clear answer on this story, and it has to do with the region free.
3296000	3297000	Is the damn thing going to be region free or not?
3297000	3308000	It seems to be that it's America versus the rest of the world, I mean Nintendo of America versus Nintendo of the rest of the world, debating on whether the damn thing is going to be region free or not.
3309000	3316000	Basically what happened is that, ok, Perrin Kaplan, who is the VP of Marketing and Corporate Affairs, she said that yes, like the Nintendo DS, the Wii is going to be free.
3317000	3322000	But then, I believe some guy from Europe said that it is not going to be region free.
3322000	3331000	I guess to further say what Perrin was saying is that she was saying, well, first party games will be region free, but we'll leave it up to the third party folks what they want to do.
3332000	3333000	What the hell?
3334000	3339000	GameSpot ran this whole little rumor control thing, hey, we were in that once, about was it true or not.
3340000	3345000	They said that getting answers from Nintendo proved difficult during one of the company's busiest days of the year.
3345000	3355000	However, after a lengthy exchange of cryptic emails, a rep finally confirmed that Kaplan's words regarding regionless first party titles and potentially regionless third party titles was indeed correct.
3356000	3357000	The Wii will be region free.
3358000	3360000	So Nintendo of America is convinced the damn thing is going to be region free.
3361000	3363000	So I don't know why the rest of the world isn't on the same page.
3364000	3367000	I hope so because I want to get Wii Play and my first Wii.
3368000	3373000	And if something like, you know, Oh and Don comes out for the Wii, damn well I'm going to believe I want that shit.
3373000	3374000	But you know what though?
3375000	3380000	I have a feeling that even if it's not, we're going to get something like what came out on the GameCube.
3381000	3388000	The thing that basically overrode the region thing is swapped out the disk.
3389000	3390000	The freeloader.
3391000	3392000	The freeloader.
3393000	3394000	Using little hacks to do it.
3395000	3398000	Especially if Nintendo is letting you on the internet with their console.
3399000	3401000	You know what a huge fucking hole that's going to be, I bet, to hackers.
3401000	3410000	The whole thing about Nintendo is that theirs has been, all of their systems have been the easiest to play imports on.
3411000	3416000	You know, for Super Famicom games all you needed to do was find like an old gyromite.
3417000	3421000	Not for Super Famicom, but for Famicom you needed an old gyromite and you could plug it in.
3422000	3425000	Or with the Super Nintendo you break out two little tabs, plug it in.
3425000	3433000	With the Nintendo 64, they sold actually a little tool that you could unscrew and then you pop another tab, put it in.
3434000	3438000	Theirs were all physical lockouts until they started moving to a digital format.
3439000	3442000	And then with that it was still something as easy as loading a code.
3443000	3444000	It was like the Dreamcast, how easy that was.
3445000	3452000	And then I have a feeling that even if they go back and it's all region coded, they're still going to have some way to bypass that.
3452000	3454000	And I really don't think Nintendo's going to care.
3455000	3458000	They haven't cared before, really. Why should they really care?
3459000	3462000	Bobby Blackwolf's in our chat right now. He does his own show over on AllGames.com.
3463000	3466000	I'm sure if you've listened to this show for any length of time you've heard us pimp him before.
3467000	3471000	He ran the same story on his show tonight, except he was reading Joystiq's version of it.
3472000	3475000	And I guess Joystiq talked to Nintendo as well and they told him, no, it's not region free.
3476000	3480000	So, shit, even with Nintendo of America, they don't know.
3480000	3484000	So, we won't know until the damn thing comes out, it sounds like.
3485000	3492000	You know what, though, I'm still really, I can't be too upset about that because there's going to be a way.
3493000	3494000	Yeah, there'll be a way.
3495000	3500000	Even if Nintendo doesn't do something, even if we don't have a developer do something, there is going to be some importer on the net,
3501000	3507000	the same people who probably figured out how to do the seven swap trick on the old PlayStation, who will figure out a way to play it.
3507000	3513000	Well, it's just like the Xbox 360 games, there are some that come out that are region free and then you can import them.
3514000	3515000	You just won't know until they come out.
3516000	3519000	I guess it's one of those things they didn't think people were going to ask about.
3520000	3523000	What do you mean you want games from other regions? What the hell is wrong with you?
3524000	3526000	They know there are importers there.
3527000	3532000	I remember paying $125 for the Sailor Moon S fighting game back in 1995.
3533000	3534000	Because you're fucking sick.
3534000	3537000	And I mean that with lots of love.
3538000	3541000	This was when it was brand new and I had to pay import fees.
3542000	3548000	And I paid for it and I bought it and I played the hell out of it and sold it back used for $60 after two years.
3549000	3555000	But still, there are people out there who will lay down the money and will do what it takes to get their imports out.
3555000	3563000	Cool. Anyways, some of the news that was coming out of Japan was actually a huge list of games that they're going to be getting for the Wii.
3564000	3566000	I thought there was a lot of stuff that was very interesting in there.
3567000	3573000	Some of the titles, at least the highlights on there, some to be announced titles for example.
3574000	3579000	There's an action game and an action RPG that's being worked on from software.
3579000	3585000	A baseball game being worked on by Konami Digital Entertainment, so that might be interesting.
3586000	3587000	Bomberman Land.
3588000	3590000	Smash Brothers, which of course we knew was coming.
3591000	3592000	Disaster, also another Nintendo game.
3593000	3598000	Donkey Kong Tarou Jet Race, which is going to be coming out in 2007.
3599000	3600000	Dragon Quest Sword.
3601000	3604000	Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles The Crystal Bearer from Square Enix.
3605000	3607000	A new Fire Emblem game from Nintendo.
3607000	3609000	As well as Harry Potter from EA.
3610000	3612000	Mario Party 8, not a big surprise there.
3613000	3617000	Mario Strikers Charge, which had been previously announced.
3618000	3619000	This one I thought was very interesting.
3620000	3624000	Music Simulation Game, of course a working title from Konami Digital Entertainment.
3625000	3626000	So, very interesting there.
3627000	3631000	Of course, one of the things I was excited about, Simple Series is coming to the Wii.
3632000	3633000	So that's really cool.
3633000	3639000	And of course, The Dog Island by Yukez, which is going to be coming out in 2007.
3640000	3644000	Super Paper Mario confirmed to be coming out on the Wii, so that's pretty interesting.
3645000	3650000	A soccer game being worked on by Konami Digital Entertainment, maybe winning 11er Pro Evolution.
3651000	3654000	And then of course Pac-Man Carnival, sounds like a mini-game type of thing.
3655000	3659000	One Piece Unlimited Adventure, and of course, Wii Music.
3659000	3662000	I have to ask, what do you think the Konami game is?
3663000	3664000	I have a crazy ass theory.
3665000	3666000	What do you guys think?
3670000	3671000	You know, I don't know.
3672000	3674000	I got one more here, I don't know what this translates to.
3675000	3676000	You might know this one, Jamie.
3677000	3681000	What's it? Totsugeki Famicom Wars W.
3682000	3684000	I actually do not know what Totsugeki means.
3685000	3686000	Maybe someone in the chat knows.
3686000	3688000	Let me see.
3690000	3691000	Good job, Drunami!
3692000	3694000	Yeah, I was thinking, because I was like, that sounds familiar.
3695000	3698000	My thought, okay, the Konami music game, just bear with me on this.
3699000	3703000	Since it's probably something new for the Wii, I would bet this series is cute enough for Nintendo.
3704000	3706000	I bet it's going to be some twisted form of pop and music.
3707000	3709000	But not with a controller like we know it.
3710000	3711000	It's going to be like a different type of pop and music.
3712000	3713000	Theory.
3713000	3715000	Weird ass theory for me.
3716000	3717000	No, theory here.
3718000	3719000	Motion sensing controller.
3720000	3721000	Music game.
3722000	3723000	Drummania.
3724000	3725000	You think?
3726000	3729000	Actually, you know, they did have one of the demos at E3 was a drumming sim.
3730000	3734000	But isn't that Wii music thing supposed to be a separate game with the orchestra and that whole thing from Nintendo?
3735000	3736000	I don't think it has a drumming thing on there.
3737000	3738000	The Wii music is just the orchestra.
3738000	3742000	You know, Chatroom seems to think it's Para Para.
3743000	3744000	We're not going to get Para Para. The whole Para Para train.
3745000	3747000	Well, but wait, this isn't for us. It's Japan we're talking about.
3748000	3750000	I'm saying, Para Para is pretty much dead in Japan.
3751000	3754000	It was a fad that lasted for like, what, five years?
3755000	3756000	Maybe it's something new.
3757000	3759000	Maybe it's like gongoro dancing or something, I don't know.
3760000	3762000	Unfortunately, the gongoro did not die with the Para Para.
3763000	3764000	Mambo gogo?
3765000	3766000	Mambo gogo would be cool.
3766000	3767000	But anyway.
3768000	3777000	Well, speaking of other games, we have coming out for the Virtual Console, Hudson, who loves us so much.
3778000	3782000	We'll be bringing 30 titles over for Virtual Console.
3783000	3785000	Some of them will be available at launch.
3786000	3787000	They haven't listed exactly what.
3788000	3792000	My speculation is we will be probably getting the Adventure Island series.
3792000	3795000	Probably the various Bomberman's.
3796000	3799000	Those are two I definitely think are going to be up there.
3800000	3801000	And Bonk.
3802000	3803000	I think I definitely.
3804000	3805000	Well, especially if they're doing turbo graphics.
3806000	3807000	You cannot have turbo graphics without Bonk.
3808000	3809000	Or Air Zonk.
3810000	3811000	Or Air Zonk. That's another good one.
3812000	3813000	That's one that Junami suggested.
3814000	3815000	But I still want my Adventure Island.
3816000	3818000	Well, another company is talking about games.
3818000	3825000	Coming over to the Wii, actually this one kind of leaked out from the ESRB ratings board there.
3826000	3830000	We've got a listing for a bunch of different Wii titles for the Virtual Console.
3831000	3840000	Including Alter Beast, Columns, Echo the Dolphin, Golden Axe, Ristar, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Toejam and Earl.
3841000	3842000	All of which are getting an E rating.
3843000	3845000	Oh God, I can't wait to play Toejam and Earl again.
3845000	3849000	What do you think though about the whole $5, $8, $10 thing?
3850000	3851000	Do you think that's going to be worth it for those old games?
3852000	3854000	They didn't really say where Genesis and Turbo Graphics fits into that though.
3855000	3860000	They just said 500 points for the old games, 800 for the SNES, and 1000 for the later ones.
3861000	3862000	Nintendo 64.
3863000	3866000	I do though have to second something that was mentioned in the chat room.
3867000	3869000	Bob Coffee said we need to get Dracula X.
3869000	3876000	We have to get one of our biggest Nintendo fans on the Skyline right now because he's dying to comment on some of this.
3877000	3881000	He knows a few things that we don't and we're going to see what we can get out of him here on the show.
3882000	3883000	DMN, are you on the line?
3884000	3885000	Yeah, you got your $20 bills out?
3886000	3887000	Why, are you going to dance?
3888000	3889000	Maybe.
3890000	3891000	Did you dress up for this phone call?
3892000	3893000	Wait, what?
3894000	3894000	Did you dress up for this phone call?
3895000	3896000	He's dressed sexy for episode 200.
3896000	3898000	I'm actually not wearing any clothes right now.
3899000	3902000	Alright, we got all types of wheeze on tonight's program.
3903000	3906000	DMN, I know you're dying to comment on this.
3907000	3911000	What do you think about all this news this week and now you can actually talk about some of the things you couldn't before I'm sure.
3912000	3913000	Yeah, a few things.
3914000	3920000	One of the things I want to say is this is the most excited I've been for a console launch since about Nintendo 64.
3920000	3931000	I would agree with that except I would go as far back to say I have not been this excited about a console at launch, keeping those words in mind, at launch since Super Nintendo.
3932000	3933000	Yeah, that's another one.
3934000	3947000	What I want to say about the Wii is having had a chance to dabble playing it a little bit, we did have a little demo thing over the week for all Nintendo employees.
3947000	3949000	It's incredibly fun.
3950000	3953000	Elibits looks amazing.
3954000	3958000	Got a chance to try a demo of WarioWare which is amazing. It's really fun.
3959000	3961000	What else can I do?
3962000	3968000	Madden 07, I got to play a couple plays of that and that may be the most fun anybody will have with a sim sports game ever.
3969000	3970000	Are you biased because you're on Reggie's payroll?
3971000	3971000	No.
3972000	3972000	No?
3973000	3973000	Swear to me?
3973000	3977000	I'm getting a 360 at some point. I'm just not getting a PS3.
3978000	3979000	So you're in the Wii 60 camp?
3980000	3980000	Yes.
3981000	3986000	Fair enough. Well, what else? Anything else you can tell us about the Wii? Maybe? Little bits? Little hints?
3987000	3988000	I'm trying to see what I can-
3989000	3990000	I don't want to get you fired so I understand if no.
3990000	4005000	There's not really anything else I can talk about because I know just about as much as you guys do in some aspects, but there's some things I can't talk about because of obvious reasons.
4006000	4007000	Right.
4008000	4009000	That's about it.
4010000	4015000	Okay. Well, that's cool. We'll take your word for it because you've probably seen the Wii more recently than any of the rest of us.
4015000	4024000	So you actually got hands on with Elibits because I saw it at the Konami thing, but I didn't get to play it really because all the Corp casts were hogging the shit out of it and we weren't really able to get on it.
4025000	4028000	I will say right here and now it will be a Katamari Damacy killer.
4029000	4031000	Oh, I don't know about that. I don't know about that.
4032000	4033000	We'll put money on that with you, Rob.
4034000	4037000	Loki, you saw this too? You think Elibits is the Katamari killer?
4038000	4038000	I don't think so.
4039000	4039000	No.
4040000	4040000	I don't think so.
4041000	4042000	It's fun. It's going to appeal to the same type of people.
4042000	4046000	Yeah, I think it's going to appeal to the same crowd, but I don't think it will sell nearly as many copies.
4047000	4048000	No, they do need to release Katamari for it, though.
4049000	4049000	They do.
4050000	4050000	Yeah, it will be interesting.
4051000	4053000	But it won't be the same guy because he said he's not doing any more Katamari.
4054000	4055000	I guess that's true. Who cares?
4056000	4056000	Just hoard it.
4057000	4059000	What makes you think that Elibits is a Katamari killer?
4060000	4069000	Just how incredibly fun it was. It was easy to just pick up and play. It took me maybe 30 seconds just to get used to what I was doing and it was clockwork from there.
4069000	4072000	It felt just as fun as a Katamari game and just as simple.
4073000	4076000	Isn't that how most Wii games are designed, though, that you just kind of pick it up and go?
4077000	4078000	Yeah. Absolutely.
4079000	4087000	Basically, for those who don't know, Elibits is basically a game where, let's say you're playing Half-Life 2 in just a random part of the neighborhood and the only thing you have is the gravity gun.
4088000	4089000	That's pretty much what it is.
4090000	4091000	Interesting.
4094000	4096000	Will I be able to sell a Wii to my mom?
4096000	4097000	If you want.
4098000	4101000	I mean, is this really the type of console that's going to appeal to everyone, you think?
4102000	4110000	Oh, absolutely. I've actually been telling my own mother about it who absolutely loves video games and she actually even seemed interested in trying it when I bought it.
4110000	4127000	So, I think that this is the direction that gaming needs to go. We need to be more part of the game rather than, you know, I don't want top-notch graphics. I don't want incredibly difficult controls. I just want a game I can pick up and play and enjoy and have fun with.
4128000	4129000	Okay. Interesting.
4129000	4140000	That's why we're not seeing it as much as the 360 and from what Sony's doing, it's just not looking like it.
4141000	4155000	Alright. But what do you think might happen with Sony in a year? Because remember, the PlayStation and PlayStation 2 launches, I think, for people who play the same type of games we do, you know, we're not really in the we buy Madden games the day they come out camp.
4155000	4160000	And granted, there's a great fan base for that and I'm not knocking that if that's what you're into.
4161000	4169000	But do you think that maybe for us who are more of the, you know, we like to play quirky music games and Japanese RPGs camp, do you think that Sony might win us over in a year?
4170000	4178000	Because I truly believe it right now that Sony may be able to schniggle a price drop and some great games in a year that, you know, don't count PS3 out.
4179000	4181000	I'm trying to be as open-minded as possible about this.
4181000	4191000	I definitely wouldn't count Sony out. It's just the price that's killing them. I think if they release a Final Fantasy and a Kingdom Hearts, yeah, absolutely, those are going to sell PS3s.
4192000	4197000	I know tons of people who if Kingdom Hearts 3 comes out, they will drop what they're doing and go buy a PS3.
4198000	4200000	Chris? Chris is nodding her head. That's me. That's me.
4201000	4206000	Alright, DM, we got to let you go because we got to get to our next round of DDR sneak peeks, but thanks so much for calling in. We appreciate it.
4206000	4218000	Oh, one more thing. One more thing. While we're talking about the Wii, you all need to listen to Orange Lounge Radio on November the 19th because I will be in studio with a Wii to give to somebody.
4219000	4225000	And the other thing, I've got, well, since he couldn't share some info about the Wii, I figured I could.
4226000	4228000	Why? What do you know that he doesn't, or that he can't share?
4229000	4230000	I have some release dates.
4230000	4240000	Oh, insider release dates. This should be interesting. That's awesome. That's a great surprise. So you're going to be here in studio with us November 19th. That's something Loki Dark Soccer didn't even know.
4241000	4243000	I did too. He mentioned it before.
4244000	4246000	I mentioned there was going to be middle.
4247000	4252000	Well, so much for surprise, but you're going to be here and giving that away live on air. That should be awesome.
4253000	4254000	Yeah, I look forward to it.
4255000	4256000	Thanks so much. You're a true fan, DM. We love you.
4257000	4258000	Alright, take care guys.
4258000	4259000	Bye.
4260000	4261000	What do you know on release dates?
4262000	4270000	Well, as we know, there's only really two Nintendo first-party titles that are launching with the Wii in the United States, including Excite Truck and, of course, Zelda Twilight Princess.
4271000	4282000	However, shortly afterwards, we will be getting the next in first-party games, which will be WarriorWare Smooth Moves, which is coming to us on January 16th, 2007.
4282000	4293000	The other thing, which is very interesting, as I mentioned before, Sonic the Secret of the Rings, of course, not a launch title, also confirmed by the launch games that were coming out.
4294000	4298000	It is in the launch window, I guess, but it's coming out March 7th, 2007.
4299000	4304000	So lots of big stuff coming from Sega in March, and I'll get to that a little bit later.
4304000	4313000	And, of course, Super Paper Mario delayed on the GameCube until the 15th of December, possibly on the Wii in the United States. I don't know.
4314000	4315000	Kind of foggy on that.
4316000	4317000	Interesting. Alright.
4318000	4326000	Well, I think that about covers all the Wii news we wanted to do tonight, so now I want to go around to everybody, our guests included, and I want to ask you guys, what do you think now, after all this news?
4327000	4332000	Are you sold on the Wii? Were you disappointed with the news you heard this week, or are you happy with the news you heard this week?
4332000	4339000	Is Nintendo going to win the next round of the console wars? What do you think? We'll start it off with Drew. Drew Nami, what do you think?
4340000	4352000	Well, personally, I've been sold on the Wii since the E3 announcements, but I know there's a lot of anti-Nintendo people out there, but despite all that, I think Nintendo's got the routine down pat.
4352000	4361000	Do one thing, do it really well, do it with innovation. I think they're definitely going to score second, if not first, in the console wars for this generation.
4361000	4381000	Loki. The only disappointment I have is that it's not coming out sooner. The price is fine, because I figured that's about the price I was going to pay for it anyways, and I know I've got to buy lots of accessories for it, because I take this thing to work, I play with my friends, and I've got to have enough controllers for everybody, because they're broke asses.
4381000	4393000	So, that's fine. The only thing I'm just worried about is that I want to make sure I get one on launch. That's my only concern right now, and I'm trying to cover my bases with that.
4393000	4416000	I do like what they've got coming out as far as games and stuff. I think we're going to see a lot of really cool, innovative things with it. I'm very interested to see these Wii channels. I don't really give a crap about the news too much, but some of the stuff is pretty cool, like the photo channel is pretty neat.
4416000	4427000	Some quick chat comments, then we'll get Chris's feedback. Knights in our chat says, the two weeks when Gears of War, the PS3, and the Wii come out, I will feel sorry for everyone at GameStop and EB Games.
4428000	4436000	Anoush in our chat says, I think Sony is going to make it again, but I have no problem with Nintendo, I'll buy a Wii 2, but Sony comes before Microsoft for me. Chris, what are your thoughts?
4436000	4449000	I don't really get sold on games or the systems that they come with too easily. It's now in school, but I don't know if I'm going to get one at launch, just because I'm really picky about the games that I do have.
4449000	4472000	Just getting the PS2, which is the only one I've got so far, and some Game Boys, but even that, that took Kingdom Hearts to go get. It's got to be a good game for me to go get it, so I probably won't get it at launch, but it sounds really good, and I'm sure you're going to hear me talk about it constantly, so I'll get enough news from it.
4472000	4497000	Here's the thing, my big thing about the Wii. The vibe I get from the Wii is the same vibe I get from thinking about playing Castle Crashers, or old arcade games like the 4-player coin-op games. That kind of vibe, where it's fun, you have your friends over, you put some chips on the table or something, you all play a fun game together. That's the kind of vibe I get from it.
4497000	4508000	Quick chat comment, then we'll get my thoughts, and then Dark Sakura. Bob Coffee says in our chat, I think Nintendo's got it. Sony's just making too many mistakes. The real battle will be here in North America.
4508000	4533000	My thoughts, you know, not since the original 8-bit Nintendo has a word penetrated the general population of America to mean video games, such as Xerox means copies, Kleenex means tissue. I do believe what Nintendo is going for with this is that they are going to make Wii the new word for video gaming.
4533000	4543000	And I think they definitely have the potential to do that. I think they've got enough with this system set up so that, you know, it's going to appeal to everyone. I mean, you can just pick this thing up and go.
4544000	4553000	I do know people that are turned off by Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 because it's just, you know, too many buttons, too damn many buttons, too much to do. And I think this is going to be the one that sells it to the families.
4553000	4563000	I think for the hardcore of hardcore gamers, there's another battle that's going to be fought there between 360 and PS3. But I think this is what Nintendo wants. Nintendo is trying to go after the casual gamer, and I think they're going to get it.
4564000	4570000	And I think the Wii, if not going to be number one, is going to be damn close. And I don't think they're going to sit in third place anymore.
4570000	4587000	But again, and I might be stealing a little bit of Jamie's thunder here, I'm sorry, but I love this quote. I have to say it. A system is only as good as the games that are on it, and if Wii doesn't continue to impress with good, solid games, I don't want to see no lull like we did on the DS.
4588000	4593000	And it looks like they're trying to avoid that because they have games planned out through March of 2007 that are all pretty solid titles.
4593000	4600000	But as long as we consistently are getting new games that keep our interest, I think Wii's got the potential to do amazingly.
4601000	4602000	Dark Soccer, your thoughts?
4603000	4615000	First of all, just to go back to what you were saying about Xerox, I remember there being an ad back in the 80s where Xerox would say this is not a generic, please don't use this as a generic.
4615000	4623000	Nintendo is on its way to having their entire corporate name being used as a generic term for games, and in terms of business, that hurts them.
4624000	4629000	So I disagree with that, just after what I've studied in business law.
4629000	4647000	But I do agree, though, that they have been the big innovators. I wanted a Wii when it was a revolution. There's never been a doubt that if Nintendo puts out a system, I am going to own it.
4647000	4659000	Nintendo could put out a cardboard box and call it the Pooh, and I would buy it.
4660000	4662000	Jamie, you're gullible. Have I ever told you that?
4663000	4667000	I am not. If it's Nintendo, it's going to be good. They've always put out quality products.
4668000	4669000	Pooh is not good.
4670000	4675000	It was an example. I didn't mean to buy Pooh.
4675000	4678000	All right. Well, those are our opinions. Take them or leave them.
4679000	4683000	We'd love to hear your opinions as well, not only in our chat room, but at our email bag, mailbag at orangelandrado.com.
4684000	4686000	And we'll be getting to some of those emails in Part B.
4687000	4689000	But for right now, we're going to shift gears here completely.
4690000	4693000	We've been running a promotion here on Orange Lounge Radio called the DDR Sneak Peaks.
4694000	4699000	We're going to take a first look at new tracks that are going to be in DDR UltraMix 4 and DDR Universe.
4699000	4706000	Tonight we have a special version of the DDR Sneak Peaks, and tonight we're going to be checking out some of the new power courses.
4707000	4711000	Well, at least we're going to check out one. We can only really play one of them in full for you guys because they're kind of long.
4712000	4718000	But we're going to check out a power course, and it's from the game DDR UltraMix 4 that's going to be out for the Xbox a little later this year.
4719000	4723000	It is songs that are mixed together, and they will have steps that go with it.
4724000	4727000	This is very reminiscent of, for those of you guys that played DDR Solo, any of those games.
4727000	4730000	You remember how they had songs that were mixed together and had a custom step set that went with it?
4731000	4734000	Well, that's what these are. They're bringing that back in these new games, UltraMix 4 and Universe.
4735000	4737000	And tonight, we're going to debut one of these power courses for you right now.
4737000	4760000	This one is from DDR UltraMix 4. It is Power Course number 2. It's the Stargaze Mix by DJ Nagi. Enjoy.
