310136	310176	Hi.
312620	314260	I found the ferret!
314280	314340	Woo!
314360	314620	Woo, ferret!
315021	317381	And definitely one person needs more caffeine.
317401	320282	Damn.
320362	322062	Could he be any more chill, Loki?
342082	345486	All right, say hello as well to Chris, who's brought us all these wonderful surprises.
345506	346247	Thank you, Chris.
346447	347048	Oh, that's okay.
348169	350051	I thought of it up as Jamie and I were eating lunch.
350111	351012	I said, you know what?
351092	351873	I should bring donuts.
352013	352313	You know what?
352534	352954	Fuck that.
353334	354616	It's their special birthday.
354976	355957	We need something better.
356017	359862	So we thought we'd get the carbiest, most sugariest thing we could find, which has very...
360462	361323	DDR Sneak Peeks
384140	396228	And it's confirmed, the ferret is gay We have our gay ferret Alright, let's try to get some gaming news out of our system Because we had a lot, a lot, a lot of it this week So first off, we start off every show How is your gaming week, DarkSakura?
396968	411197	My gaming week was actually still more pinball We got another pinball machine Another one We have a Guns N' Roses pinball My god, you guys are nuts We're working on it right now And I played some more Mario
411995	414256	and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and.
414516	414816	That's it.
415757	416797	All right.
417197	418078	Loki, how was your gaming week?
418098	419058	Oh, I watched some porn, too.
419478	420499	Oh, congratulations.
420619	420979	Thank you.
421219	422460	Was it head-tired?
422580	423660	And I got some yelling now.
425641	426842	How was your gaming week?
426862	428662	I don't know if that would be considered game.
428722	429763	I consider it fun.
431238	432939	Well... You can play the Yowie drinking game.
433359	437140	I streamed HD porn to my 360, so does that count?
437260	438380	I was there when you did that.
438420	440301	Tell everyone, do I get to lick the frosting off the candle?
440521	440861	Yes!
441381	448424	Well, actually, I had another one, too, that we downloaded that we streamed off my wonderful laptop here because it has Media Center Edition on it.
448864	454366	But, no, yeah, you can stream stuff with Media Center Extender and...
455709	460232	and unfortunately, well, actually fortunately, the only thing that we had to test it with is porno.
460412	464435	So we streamed, you know, 720p porno.
465476	467737	And the only thing we had to test with was porno.
469078	470039	So, yeah.
470639	473381	So we did that and it is very crisp.
474179	475060	Very, very crisp.
475280	481383	The only thing I'm disappointed with... I actually saw it too, and I will never see a clearer muff in my entire life.
482183	489407	The only thing that's bad about it though, and I don't know if... I couldn't stream it with like Dolby or anything like that.
489888	491228	That would be really cool if I could do that.
491849	493910	But, you know, whatever, it's cool.
494890	495631	So we did that.
496411	503555	So actual gaming stuff, I actually played some stuff, including, and I don't know why, I got it for free from work, Bomberman Act Zero.
504176	520346	and it started off pretty fun, but the whole thing, it's really sad that the game fails by things that I would think that would be really easy for the devs to either fix or, I don't know, figure out that they were wrong in the first place.
521067	523028	The first thing, of course, being the fact that you don't
523376	528500	You can't save at all, so if you were to beat the game, you'd have to play through 99 levels straight.
528620	534324	By the way, only one hit and you're dead, and you have to go all the way back to one, so that kind of sucks.
534584	536506	There's no live system or anything like that.
536926	541950	That's really kind of the only thing that detracts you from the whole game, that and the fact that the camera angles are kind of confusing sometimes.
542510	550676	So, I don't know, it gets annoying, but it's still Barman, it's pretty fun, but, you know, I wouldn't have paid money for it, so thank God I didn't have to.
551706	552166	XBOX Live Arcade
567042	570143	You need to really make some better games to put them out on live.
570243	571864	Konami, Gradius, K-Thanks.
572564	575385	Also, maybe make your games, I don't know, widescreen?
575905	580346	I mean, seriously, if they remade it for the graphics and stuff, why didn't they just add widescreen support to it?
580526	582027	I don't know, that wouldn't be that difficult.
582647	585548	You get pretty borders on the left and right side of the screen.
586368	588549	Same borders are in every Konami arcade game.
589870	591311	Anyway, so I played those.
591331	592752	I played a little bit more Geometry Wars.
592792	596055	I played multiplayer on Marble Blast, which was kind of lame.
596155	601179	I don't like the multiplayer on Marble Blast because every time you start a multiplayer game, you're in the middle of someone else's game.
601219	605042	So there's no possible way for you to win because they're like 75 points ahead of you.
605102	607504	Well, wait until the game's over and then they start a new game.
608265	610227	That's fine, but that doesn't always happen.
610807	612929	So that's kind of lame, but whatever.
613449	615631	And then what else did I play?
616701	646021	more Grand Theft Auto of course actually I emailed Rockstar about Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories because we do play it so much and we were bragging or I was bragging to them that I probably played it more than the devs did and I think I probably did since it doesn't seem like they played it much and then yeah so hopefully I'll hear back from them because I want to know how their multiplayer is coming for that game because they better not fuck it up or I will fly down there and beat them to death anything else?
647187	651948	Uh, that's... Oh, I play Mario Kart on the DS while I was waiting for my dad for a movie today.
652948	653168	Fun.
653248	655669	I play Battle Mode, and I don't like the Battle Mode in there.
656429	664770	Alright, um, I'm going to our chat room, which of course is always one of our other guests, www.orangelandtrader.com Oh, I'm sorry, and I play Chrome Helms in multiplayer.
664970	666051	And got your ass kicked from what I hear.
666631	668631	Well, that's because my mech sucks.
669231	672752	I'm looking at our chat room, in fact, so many people in chat tonight, the names are scrolling off the screen.
673152	674152	We can't see, so...
675518	679982	Anyway, I want to point out Robert M in chat says, I'd like to see Gyruss on live.
680362	680783	It's coming.
681083	681744	We know it's coming.
682024	683085	It's been previously announced.
683225	683486	When?
683826	685748	Couldn't tell you, but that's one I'm looking forward to as well.
685788	686308	I love Gyruss.
686749	687149	Awesome game.
688210	688731	My Gaming Week.
689676	690417	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
710095	711076	I don't like Stage 2.
711236	715017	The stupid, I don't know what the fuck it is, little asteroid things are pissing me off.
715057	716217	I can't shoot fast enough in that game.
734274	736535	It will not let me shoot as fast as I want to.
736615	737196	You know the trick?
737216	737756	This is what I do.
737796	745119	I put the controller down, and I tap the buttons like my fingers are running between bullet, bomb, bullet, bomb, bullet, bomb.
745139	749001	And I do that really fast, and that's how I get all the way through stage four, at least.
749181	752763	Because stage five, the trick is you have to maneuver around really quickly, and it's kind of hard.
753043	753403	It's a hard stage.
753423	754904	Since that ship is like a boat.
755984	758806	So anyway, we have done...
760040	761261	Scramble, and it's okay.
761381	764985	I mean, if you like the classics, the upgrade was actually one of the nicer upgrades.
765005	767447	The graphics do look really well, and the sound's been done a lot better.
768047	778737	But the game itself, I can't recommend it when it's put next to $5 games such as Geometry Wars, and hell, even something like Frogger or Time Pilot was a better buy than Scramble, I'm sorry to say.
779538	782421	I wish they would put effort into better games, but that's just me.
782741	784002	The other game I played was...
785581	786742	Surprisingly pleasant.
786902	790304	I played Test Drive Unlimited, which I actually enjoyed quite a bit.
790644	799349	The gameplay is a lot like it reminded me of Need for Speed Underground, and so you're probably thinking to yourself, okay, why do I need yet another racer on the Xbox 360?
799429	800569	What makes this so special?
800950	802371	Well, Test Drive Unlimited is massive.
802431	812016	You are literally driving around the entire island of Oahu, and it's not 100% geographically correct, but for folks who've never been there like me,
812797	818800	It's got that illusion of that it does seem to be pretty right on to what it's probably really like in that environment.
819140	830845	And you drive around and you do different races, like you stop at different intersections and do races, or you pick up hookers and take them to the shopping place they need to go, or you drive cars, hitchhikers, lots of different types of quests and things you can do.
830885	832726	It's a questing driving game.
833106	840389	But the other weird thing about it that's getting this game a lot of notoriety is that even when you're playing in single player mode, if you're playing on Xbox Live...
841304	845788	Some of the dummy cars that you usually see driving in traffic are actually other players.
846229	847830	And you'll see their Xbox Live name.
847910	849552	They are playing single mode as well.
849932	852975	So it's kind of like an MMO, but not really.
853475	854977	It's the weirdest concept.
854997	858160	That is exactly why I can't get that game, because I'd be such a jackass.
858600	860121	It's weird, though.
860642	861463	I'll tell you what, though.
862083	870105	I love the idea, and I think it's great that they're doing this to make the game different than other racing games.
870465	871785	But I don't know.
872025	876286	I find when I'm racing around, I don't really run into other people right next to them very often.
876326	878126	I've driven by maybe three people.
879286	885808	Supposedly, you're supposed to crash into them and start a race, but sometimes they drive by so fast, you don't even realize somebody went by.
886268	887148	I guess that's what you have to do.
888682	889382	It's interesting.
889422	890123	It's an interesting concept.
890143	894446	I'll have to play the game a little more to see how it's fully enabled.
894706	897288	I just joined the Oil Army Clan thanks to Robway.
897328	899590	He created the Oil Army Clan on the game, so I just joined that.
899910	901812	So look for that if you're on test drive.
903991	904451	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
922214	937987	The other quick thing I wanted to say about Test Drive Unlimited is I was kind of bummed out that some of the multiplayer races, at least none of the ones I drove by, were restricted by car class because I got the game about a week after it came out and by the time I'm ready to do multiplayer races, everybody in there has like a souped up maximum top of the line car.
938267	949416	So I would have liked to have seen some multiplayer races that were restricted a little more by the class car so you could have like beginner multiplayer races, intermediate, and not everybody's just kicking my ass because they have a top of the line car because they've been playing longer.
949777	950737	So that was my thought.
951398	951478	So
953059	955960	I do recommend Test Drive Unlimited if you're a fan of driving games.
956740	961661	And I think even if you're not a fan of driving games, rent it, check it out, because you might... I mean, it's a good deal, $40.
962781	969262	It's cheaper than the usual Xbox 360 games, so it's hard for me to ignore that as well, being a big factor in why I would recommend this game for you to pick up.
969442	971623	Plus, it's fun driving a Lamborghini off-road.
972263	973223	It is, but... Over hills.
973303	974423	The cops get annoying.
974703	975443	They get really annoying.
975723	976824	I wish there was a way you could turn them off.
976904	979144	No, it's funny, but the cops, they can't follow you off-road.
979935	980275	Oh, really?
980295	980895	I didn't realize that.
980915	981676	No, they're stupid.
981716	985497	They can't figure out how to get off the road, so they have to just drive through an unpaved section.
985537	987297	They're like, duh, where'd he go?
987377	990478	Or just sit in the grass, and they're like, oh, I don't know how to get to him.
990798	996140	JeremyTaw1 in chat says, a friend I know that lives in Hawaii says the map is really close to the area, but it isn't perfect.
996420	999201	He says he can see where he is in the game because he knows the roads in person.
999261	1001081	So, yeah, it's pretty close to the actual thing.
1001742	1002422	It's kind of interesting.
1003782	1004042	All right.
1004843	1006103	Drew Nami, how was your gaming week?
1006932	1009113	Well, not too eventful.
1009333	1011534	I've been leveling a warrior in World of Warcraft.
1012394	1012854	It's pretty good.
1012874	1021077	I can see where a lot of people say they're IMBA, but I haven't really got past 18, so that remains to be seen.
1021237	1026079	I've also been trying to finish Zenisaga Episode 1, or rather watching it.
1028140	1034942	I admit, I like it even though it's very, very long on cutscenes, and the battle system is sort of frustrating.
1035638	1037600	But it's a good game, very deep story.
1037880	1040101	Other than that, I haven't really been doing much in the way of gaming.
1042463	1042743	All right.
1043344	1045826	Chris, anything you want to share with how your gaming week's been going?
1046026	1047127	Well, you remembered me this time.
1047247	1048187	I did, I'm sorry.
1048588	1049408	How could I forget?
1049448	1050269	You brought me cake.
1050389	1051450	I brought you chocolate.
1051470	1052751	You're a skanky, skanky ho-bag.
1052891	1053211	Yeah, I know.
1054032	1055032	No, no, she said Rob is.
1055733	1057634	Hey, why am I a skanky ho-bag?
1058195	1060176	That's her way of saying she loves you.
1060356	1062638	That's her way of saying she loves you.
1062658	1063098	Oh, okay.
1063138	1065380	Hugs and kisses and smoothies to you, sweetie.
1067647	1071690	Aside from Sins 2, I got Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance and Baldur's Gate 2 Dark Alliance.
1072130	1076293	I found them on Amazon for each $60, but I got them new.
1077013	1078034	Did it have a monkey on the cover?
1078354	1079114	No, it didn't have a monkey.
1079154	1079495	Shut up.
1080455	1083917	I've been playing both of those because I never got to finish both of them.
1086539	1086999	I like it.
1088040	1088900	That was my gaming week.
1090221	1091262	Alright, right on.
1091522	1094524	And I burned my fingernail lighting your candles.
1099912	1101814	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1121687	1123449	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1145407	1146488	Thanks for watching!
1162839	1164300	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1190865	1194149	About the 200th regular week we've been putting out some type of gaming-related programming out there.
1194169	1197674	Not to mention all the live shows that we've done, special shows and fuck-off shows.
1197734	1198134	Exactly.
1198174	1198835	We've been live at E3.
1198855	1200698	We were live at Arena this year for E3.
1201018	1203321	We were live at the B3 DDR tournament.
1203341	1205123	We were live at a Scandia tournament.
1205203	1206145	We were live at some...
1206685	1208106	Weren't we live at Milpitas once?
1208246	1209466	Golf Land for DDR?
1209726	1210286	I think we were.
1210546	1214167	Just a bunch of crazy shit we've been doing throughout the years with DDR community.
1214227	1215488	And now general gaming as well.
1215508	1219109	We know our fan base has now expanded past just those who are into music games.
1219369	1221930	And of course, we'll never forget our love of music games.
1221970	1222830	We always have plenty of news.
1222850	1224511	Of course, we have the DDR sneak peeks tonight.
1224531	1225991	I think that just further goes to show that.
1226391	1227672	We haven't forgotten our roots.
1227712	1230013	Konami finally noticed us like two months ago.
1230073	1230993	It's kind of amazing.
1231593	1232233	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1257625	1258266	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1268437	1269858	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network
1290226	1294509	Like, you know, we're not afraid to run the rumors when we sense there's some bit of legitimacy to them.
1294769	1298071	And we want to, you know, scoop the big, big media reports and things of that nature.
1298111	1302094	But unfortunately, once in a while, something's going to happen that causes us to be wrong.
1302114	1304215	And unfortunately, this time it happens to be a big one.
1304537	1307258	And this was a story that was picked up on a lot of news sites that we ran.
1307318	1308098	Loki, what happened?
1308138	1309398	And this isn't really our fault.
1309658	1310259	No, it's not.
1310439	1312879	It's the company, the site.
1313139	1315920	But you guys have to understand, this is what's going to happen when we do this.
1315960	1317841	You know, is Ain't It Cool News right all the time?
1318121	1318861	Hell no, they're not.
1318961	1321682	But, you know, they... And stuff changes all the time.
1321762	1323782	I mean, it's just like when we report dates and stuff.
1323822	1324943	Dates change all the time.
1324983	1329404	But anyways, this is about the Phantasy Star Universe online subscription fees.
1330104	1335926	Um, before we reported that the Xbox 360 version would be free and the PlayStation 2 and PC would be pay.
1336466	1342647	Well, Sega went back on what they decided to do and they're deciding to charge for the online service.
1342887	1344608	And here is exactly why they're doing it.
1345148	1348689	Um, and this is straight from an email from our sales rep from Sega.
1349069	1349789	It says, um,
1351080	1355904	I just wanted to update you on what's going on regarding the subscription service we have with Phantasy Star Universe.
1356024	1365572	As you know, the game will have an extensive 40-hour single-player mode as well as online questing mode that allows players to create a character, customize that character, and meet up with other players to complete quests online.
1365892	1372557	The single-player portion is separate from the online mode, and it will work as normal on PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, and PC.
1373658	1375580	The online mode, however, is a bit different.
1375600	1379262	To play online, the user will have to create an account with Sega and pay a monthly fee of $9.99.
1380370	1384033	This will be required for all versions of the game, including the 360 version.
1384093	1388416	Previously, we had thought the 360 version would not have a fee due to the Xbox Live fees.
1388736	1389877	That has since changed.
1390157	1400745	The good news is, this is nothing new for Phantasy Star Universe, in that all online versions of Phantasy Star have had this fee in the past, and that even the last Xbox version, which played over Live,
1401900	1402941	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1426328	1434010	However, the good news is that we have a marketplace demo that will allow users to get a small taste of the offline and online portions of the game.
1434490	1439492	And it says, I know subscription fees are not a very common thing for the console games, and that's why I wanted to inform you of this.
1441012	1448495	Well, unfortunate, but I mean, Sega told us one thing and then told us another, but as you can understand, I mean, you know they were considering it.
1449055	1455457	They were considering it, and I think what it comes down to is that they found out they can charge for it, and so they went ahead and did it.
1455577	1455957	I mean, and
1456676	1458016	A lot of negative feedback from chat.
1458076	1461757	People saying they're not going to get the game now because they don't pay for MMOs on monthly.
1461837	1462937	I'm with them on that.
1463057	1466878	I was going to buy the game, and to be honest, I'm not really interested anymore.
1467538	1468959	I'm interested in the Marketplace demo.
1468979	1471119	I'm going to make my decision solely based off the demo.
1471179	1477620	I am encouraged that at least the demo they're going to put on Marketplace will support on and offline, and that will be the decision maker for me.
1478020	1478961	I'll pay for MMOs.
1478981	1479841	I paid for World of Warcraft.
1479861	1480661	I paid for Final Fantasy XI.
1481441	1486223	I'm not against paying for MMOs, but it's got to be good, and I want to try it before I buy it.
1486243	1486803	It's called Guild Wars.
1505992	1507093	Well, they don't have Guild Wars on the 360.
1508274	1517880	That's why I don't play MMOs on the 360, because I don't have the time to dedicate, you know, to play it regularly, so I don't want to pay this extra monthly fee, because I know I'm not going to use it.
1517980	1521883	Whereas, you know, Phantasy Star, I figured, okay, I get to buy it, and I can play online whenever I want.
1522183	1524084	Awesome, you know, that sold it for me.
1524144	1528307	But now this news, you know, right when I saw it, I was like, fuck, you know.
1528407	1535452	I knew this was something that was going to possibly happen, so not a huge surprise, since they've been charging all,
1535666	1537987	You know, all the time, but whatever.
1538047	1539508	I mean, life goes on, I guess.
1539829	1540809	Yeah, kind of unfortunate.
1540849	1548774	Jamie, I'm really curious about your thoughts, because you're a big Phantasy Star supporter, and I imagine you're probably going to play this anyway, but what do you think about all this back and forth, paying, no paying stuff?
1549774	1555578	I think half of it is that they're charging because, well, first of all, they're in the business to make money, so why shouldn't they charge?
1556518	1561301	But regardless, and actually Ranma made this point in the chat room, it's still one of the cheapest MMOs you can play.
1561481	1562462	I think that, you know...
1564282	1573865	I think that if charging the fee might lead to better service, you know, give them more money for development into the game to expand it later on, that's my hope.
1575065	1578306	But I really don't care because I was going to play it anyway.
1578326	1579747	All right.
1580427	1584368	I figured if you want to play something bad enough, no price should keep you from enjoying it.
1585208	1585468	All right.
1585488	1586569	Well, we'll see.
1586609	1589269	We encourage your emails if you want to give us some feedback on this.
1589689	1591390	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.
1591909	1596571	And I imagine some people might be kind of pissed at us for reporting the news before, but you know what, guys?
1596591	1600233	We had certainly a big reason to believe it was true, because Sega told us.
1600654	1605196	So, you know, if you are unhappy with that, sorry.
1605819	1612281	I guess you can stick to getting press releases and things when everybody else gets them and won't know any news beforehand.
1612621	1629187	But to Loki's credit, a lot of the rest of that story has turned out to be right on when it comes to a lot of the stories about the Wii that we're going to get into tonight and the GT steering wheel and some of the other things that you report in that story are coming true.
1629627	1630787	We can't predict the future.
1631388	1635489	If they go and change what their plan is for something, we're not
1636055	1636877	We're not going to know.
1636957	1638600	I mean, it's up to them.
1638660	1646937	So if they decide to go back on what they want charged, hell, we can't be right all the time when it comes to them changing stuff.
1646957	1647719	Right, right.
1648652	1651454	All right, well, as we mentioned, there was a lot of big news this week.
1651514	1655817	Big, big, big news about this little system coming out from Nintendo called Wii.
1656397	1662601	And we're dedicating just about the rest of this segment to talk about this because there was so much news that came with the Wii.
1662981	1670026	So, of course, if you've been living in a cave or for some reason you only get your gaming news from OLR, which is kind of cool, I guess, here's the deal.
1670086	1674088	The Wii is coming out on November 19th, and it's coming out for a price of $250.00.
1676629	1677870	249.99.
1676669	1677870	Whatever.
1677990	1679791	After tax, it's going to be over $250.
1680311	1682152	It's going to be packaged with Wii Sports.
1682832	1684332	Controllers will be sold separately.
1684953	1689594	The Wiimote, which is the official name for it, it sounds like, the Wiimote is going to be what?
1690535	1691375	The remote and nunchuck.
1691395	1696117	One price, and then the nunchuck, the Wiimote's going to be like $40, and the nunchuck's going to be $20.
1696317	1698758	And that was everything that was announced at the press conference.
1698818	1702659	Pretty much the price point it looks like right now is the remote's going to be $39.99.
1704778	1708386	Whereas the attachments are going to be $19.99.
1708426	1711833	And who called the price?
1711893	1712414	That would be me.
1713216	1713537	Good job.
1714638	1715899	So, yeah, so that's where it stands.
1715919	1718180	Now, a lot of people are saying the controllers are too damn expensive.
1718700	1718820	No.
1718840	1723002	But, I didn't, I mean, okay, because when you consider it's the nunchuck and the controller, it's going to be about $60.
1723342	1724923	You don't have to buy the nunchuck.
1724943	1726244	You do not have to have it.
1726464	1729145	A lot of games do not use it unless it's like a first-person shooter.
1729285	1732987	Plus, I do believe, isn't a wireless Xbox 360 controller $49?
1733867	1741651	It's $49.99, and that's not even with the rechargeable, I mean, granted, the Wii does not have a rechargeable battery pack, at least as far as I'm aware.
1742391	1743592	Two double A's, but it does last
1744195	1745915	Quite a long time, apparently.
1746536	1748136	And so, I don't know.
1748316	1750436	I'm not trying to knock Xbox 360's price at all.
1750496	1751016	I think it's fair.
1751076	1755257	I'm just saying, you know, Nintendo doesn't seem that bad, but a lot of people were very disappointed in the price that they heard.
1755597	1758978	And I thought it was kind of like, well, isn't that what kind of everyone was expecting?
1759378	1760699	I guess some people had their sights on $200.
1761439	1761959	But I don't know.
1762439	1766740	I want to say, I swear to God, I said on this show previously, I bet you anything Wii Sports is a pack-in game.
1767260	1770121	And people were telling me, no, because they haven't done a pack-in game in years.
1770141	1771121	No, it makes perfect sense.
1771161	1772281	No, Wii Sports is like,
1772990	1776553	It's not gamey enough to be a game, but it's good enough to be a packing game.
1776573	1777733	It's just like world-class track meet.
1777933	1779014	That's exactly what it is to me.
1779054	1780015	It's world-class track meet.
1780355	1782056	It's also something that's very simple.
1782076	1784918	They'll teach you how to use the controller and stuff like that.
1785118	1785539	Exactly.
1785999	1788581	All right, well, we have plenty of Wii news all around the table tonight.
1789001	1790762	Well, there is a bit more about Wii Sports.
1792103	1800129	Again, it is going to be bundled in with the Wii at release, but there's been suggestions, especially, actually, it states that...
1801288	1804689	for EGM that it was going to support over 30 different games.
1805509	1809510	But the official ones listed are tennis, baseball, golf, bowling, and boxing.
1810530	1814611	And it's all pretty much the same simple thing.
1814651	1821013	Like for anyone who watched the press release, it's pretty much the same type style of thing that you saw in the press release.
1822513	1822713	Okay.
1823415	1824676	I guess bowling is a sport.
1825257	1826658	Bowling will be kind of fun.
1826678	1828299	I wonder if it will have curling.
1828519	1832403	Tennis wasn't bad, but again, I bet baseball will be a lot of fun with multiple people.
1832483	1846694	And you know, I think the concept and the reason why the remote costs so much and watching the Wii press event and everything, I think the concept is you're going to build your personality on your Wii remote thing and you want to take it to other places, right?
1848024	1859800	Well, actually, it's stating that in particular for Wii Sports is that you're going to use your, I guess, the Mii caricature to play in the game so that you can actually play versus people to personalize the game for you.
1860916	1865019	So I don't think that it's Nintendo wants you to buy four Wiimotes for your household.
1865359	1871583	They want you and all three of your friends to buy Wiis, and then you bring your Wiimote with you, like you bring your iPod with you everywhere to share music.
1871603	1875566	You're going to bring your Wiimote, and I guess I'm also being corrected in chat, that's not the real name.
1875606	1877807	It's going to be the Wii Remote, but I don't care.
1877827	1878908	It's a Wii Remote, or Wiimote.
1879329	1880269	I feel like WiiCon.
1880609	1883110	I think they've used Wiimote actually.
1883250	1886130	I swear I heard in that press conference somebody say Wiimote, but whatever, it doesn't matter.
1886451	1892652	So whatever that thing is, the thing, you're going to take the thing with you to other people's houses and then, you know, your character's on there ready to go.
1893132	1900494	And it has, didn't we already reveal on this show previously in some news article that it had some type of storage on the actual remote itself?
1900734	1902854	So it probably saves basic stats and things.
1902914	1906615	Like, you know, you can go to your friend's house and, oh, hey, you're four and two in baseball right now.
1906655	1907315	Let's play, you know.
1907882	1909623	Sort of be like bringing your memory card with you.
1909923	1910724	Or your DS.
1911244	1912484	Yeah.
1912604	1914345	I think that's exactly what it is.
1914425	1914986	So, I don't know.
1916526	1916826	Anyways.
1917607	1919188	Well, some other interesting things about the Wii.
1919268	1926111	In Japan, of course, which was the first news that we got about the Wii, it's going to be launching for 25,000 yen.
1926811	1932414	And what's kind of interesting, though, is they are not getting the pack-in for Wii Sports.
1932514	1933535	That is separate.
1933635	1934855	You have to buy that separately.
1934935	1936076	And that's actually going to cost...
1937116	1953164	around 3,800 yen is going to be the price of the remote, 1,800 for the nunchuck attachment, and 1,800 for the classic controller, which also, by the way, 1,999 for the classic controller in the United States.
1955045	1957966	Wii Sports, though, is going to be a pretty inexpensive game.
1959190	1960971	So that should be pretty interesting.
1960991	1969055	One of the other games I saw on there, which is really cool, Wii Play, which is going to be for the people that saw the E3 tech demos and stuff, like the shooting demo.
1969095	1969496	Duck Hunt?
1970336	1971477	Yeah, like the Duck Hunt game.
1971857	1974038	Those are in Wii Play, some of them.
1974238	1975279	So that's kind of cool.
1975519	1976599	Hopefully we'll get it in the States.
1976659	1980701	I know that UK's getting it and stuff like that, but it should be interesting.
1980801	1984963	Camden in our chat room is making a little play on the whole Mii thing and put Mii Emoto.
1985324	1985584	Get it?
1985664	1985884	Yeah.
1987069	1995231	You remember when you saw the E3 demo with all four of them playing and the little heads were on the bodies and they looked like Miyamoto and everything?
1995671	1997892	That was it, because they had made their things on the Mi.
1998432	1999232	Now it all makes sense.
1999592	2000593	So that's kind of interesting.
2000993	2004854	I just want to say real quick, or ask a quick question.
2005214	2007134	Why do you think Japan's not getting Wii Sports?
2007174	2010495	Why do you think they opted not to do that and do a cheaper bundle instead without it?
2011992	2016995	Just economical reasons, I actually stand a chance of making more money having the game separate.
2017275	2024040	Also, Japan's getting theirs on December 2nd, which is surprising because they're not the first ones to launch with the Wii, the United States is.
2024580	2024960	Interesting.
2025541	2026001	We're loved.
2026961	2027722	Heart, Nintendo.
2028763	2034206	Anyway, as far as speaking of the Nintendo love, this is in UK news.
2035355	2042599	The Wii is going to retail for 249 euros, which is 179 pounds in the UK.
2043839	2046521	Also with it will be about 20 release games.
2047201	2061908	It's Wii Play, Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess, and some third-party games like Red Steel, Need for Speed Carbon, Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam, Pixar's Cars.
2062839	2064760	and Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz.
2064880	2065761	That sounds kind of fun.
2067101	2069722	Also, it will be bundled with Wii Sports as well.
2071083	2077146	It will come with one Wii Remote, one Nunchuck and, again, Wii Sports.
2079047	2085930	I think it's funny that they're getting the... I think it's interesting that Europe is not getting the shaft for once with the release time.
2085950	2088912	I mean, sure, we're beating them to it, but to be ahead of Japan...
2089545	2092666	That's weird to me that Japan isn't getting this thing until December.
2093046	2093946	That is so weird to me.
2094687	2098988	Well, actually, it says that the European release date is 8th of December.
2099248	2099768	Oh, my bad.
2099868	2100488	I thought it was before.
2100508	2100808	I'm sorry.
2100828	2101929	I was going to say.
2101989	2102829	My bad, my bad.
2102869	2104069	Okay, so Europe did get the shaft.
2104089	2105870	Sorry, guys.
2105970	2106710	It's not that bad.
2106750	2108851	It's not as bad as the usual Nintendo shaft.
2108871	2109571	It's not as bad.
2109711	2111192	So I guess there's that.
2111212	2112352	And I understand why they're doing it.
2112372	2114533	It's because they're launching so many units in the United States.
2114553	2119274	They've got to catch up, make sure they have enough for the launch in the other territories.
2120080	2123627	Well, it's also going to, of course, we'll be going into a little bit more about this later.
2124389	2128156	Of course, we'll have the Wii Channel menu and a pretty interesting interface.
2128877	2129118	All right.
2129571	2136994	Well, if you want to spin your globe all the way around and take a look at Australia, Australia's launch looks pretty comparable to what Europe's getting.
2137294	2139235	The console's going to launch there on December 7, 2006.
2140415	2145017	The retail price will be $399.95, but that's Australian.
2146177	2149778	And then they're also going to have Wii Sports as their pack-in game.
2150439	2154420	And, of course, all the other good stuff you've been hearing about with the interface and everything.
2154744	2155605	Nothing too different there.
2156085	2158527	But Australia's not being left out of the worldwide launch.
2158768	2165694	So it looks like Nintendo has this worldwide launch thing down where Sony, with their whole worldwide means Japan and the U.S.
2165774	2171499	only, might need to... Sony just makes it easy to bash on them.
2171539	2172600	I really don't want to.
2172940	2174721	My question for Nintendo is, what about Africa?
2176043	2177984	Where is that only the domain of Sony now?
2178805	2179345	Africa.
2179366	2179806	Africa.
2180767	2180927	So...
2181496	2183338	Well, maybe we'll hear something on that later, I don't know.
2183538	2191284	But we all know that Mr. Kudaragi needs crayons and wears a helmet, so we can't be too upset at him.
2192005	2193766	I will be curious to see.
2193827	2202754	Again, I think like most PlayStation consoles, and I don't want to get off topic too much, but like most PlayStation consoles, I don't think we'll truly be able to judge the PlayStation 3 until this time next year.
2203415	2206898	I really don't think we're going to start seeing the big guns until then, but whatever.
2206938	2207218	Whatever.
2207577	2209538	I did say November I gave you a couple weeks in November
2238988	2240211	Meg Z got an exact date.
2240251	2241213	I think I should point that out.
2241373	2242817	I saw her call that on her live journal.
2242857	2243458	That was cool.
2243839	2245142	She was really, really happy about that.
2245911	2253773	I do want to point out, Loki, in your thing you did on 198, you were one of the first people to say, hey, Nintendo is debating launching after Sony.
2253973	2258335	Because most people, when they were guessing the launch date, were guessing things before the 17th.
2258355	2261416	You were one of the first people to say, they are thinking about doing it after.
2261516	2266217	To be honest, all the dates in our system that we had, all the launch games were on the 15th of November.
2266357	2272139	And I was like, that's got to be a to-be-announced date, because there's no way that they would launch it at the same time as Sony.
2272199	2273279	And here I was wrong, though.
2274127	2275828	It was right in front of my face.
2276348	2277469	But whatever.
2277589	2278129	Who cares?
2278389	2281771	It's just a fun little game until the system actually launches.
2282231	2285412	Ranma in our chat regarding the Wii launch in Africa says, Fuck them.
2285472	2287673	Send Africa refurbished N64s.
2287893	2290054	That's not nice.
2291395	2292855	Have Ellen give out some Wiis.
2293175	2294796	Have Ellen give out some Wiis to Africa.
2294816	2295316	I hate Ellen.
2295356	2296797	We'll send Suzanne Summers there.
2297177	2299519	with food for the starving children and wheeze.
2299559	2302501	You guys, he gave away to a blind guy.
2302541	2303661	What the hell is he going to do with that?
2303681	2309825	There's lots of areas to Africa and I'm sure some of them are waiting and willing for their wheeze.
2309866	2310426	They want it.
2310566	2312127	I actually did go searching for the date.
2312227	2319952	I could not find it, but I would imagine given that the majority of the world is getting theirs in December, theirs is probably close to the same time.
2320432	2321613	If not, then early next year.
2321653	2324855	I'm sure you will have your wheeze soon enough, Africa.
2325356	2325756	Anyway, it's
2326395	2333659	Well, as we mentioned before, I believe we talked about this, it came out that the Wii will not support DVD playback.
2333959	2341983	Now, what we were told, of course, before is that they're going to have an add-on little thing for it, kind of like the Xbox did where you'd be able to play DVDs.
2342083	2344524	Well, they've opted on not doing that at all.
2345085	2352008	In fact, it says that Nintendo of America's Vice President of Marketing and Corporate Affairs, Perrin Kaplan, confirmed to IGN,
2352712	2357296	We today that its forthcoming Wii console will not play Hollywood DVD movies.
2357757	2365304	The decision to remove the functionality was made in order to deliver the machine at cheaper costs because most people today already own DVD players.
2365704	2367165	And to be honest, it makes perfect sense.
2367606	2371469	The GameCube didn't play DVDs, and I wasn't sad about it, so who cares?
2371749	2372910	You know what's interesting about this?
2373291	2376774	This is a direct opposite philosophy to what Sony's doing.
2377307	2377607	DarkSakura.com
2396570	2398112	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2412126	2415950	There are things that are in the interface that aren't only strictly games, right?
2416310	2417791	So there's a little something extra.
2418091	2422415	That is true, but I still think that the focus is on games and should stay that way.
2422855	2427319	That's why I think that Sony's shooting themselves in the balls.
2427399	2431823	I think it's more of a cost of technology thing where it's like, you know, why pay for the DVD player to be in there, you know,
2432130	2432951	I didn't catch this.
2432971	2435614	Why did Nintendo tell you there was going to be a dongle and now they didn't?
2448889	2451430	That's because of the licensing for DVD playback.
2451790	2456732	You have to pay for licensing fees, and that's why they charge for that stuff, because it covers the cost of licensing.
2456752	2458093	That's why Xbox does the same thing.
2458353	2461715	It's not because it can't, it's just because, well, you know, it's just not gonna.
2461915	2462755	I gotcha, I gotcha.
2463502	2467245	Well, as far as... We are just so Wii-centric today, aren't we?
2467806	2470188	It also gave me an excuse to say Wii-centric.
2470288	2472210	It's the hugest thing in gaming right now.
2472250	2475272	When we get into Part B, we'll have some non-Wii stuff, but we've got to get this out.
2475592	2478335	I just said that so that I could use Wii-centric in a sentence.
2478515	2479916	Cute.
2480296	2484000	But regarding more Wii games, actually, they have announced...
2485395	2491298	Resident Evil game for the Wii titled Biohazard Umbrella Chronicles.
2492418	2500841	It's produced by Masachika Kawata who was also the one who ported RE4 to the PlayStation 2.
2502702	2503703	I have to make this crack.
2504183	2504923	Resident Weevil.
2506404	2507744	Resident Weevil.
2508024	2508845	Go to hell!
2510245	2512086	And take your toilet paper joke book with you.
2513587	2514547	It survived for this long.
2515416	2543506	Resident Weevil God Capcom was saying that they were supposed to combine the gaming experience and atmosphere but involve the Wii control system with it they're still not leaving any details it's still saying it's an action game still is going to use the WiiCon but they're not really giving any more detail however another game that we did get some detail on was Forever Blue which is a diving game
2544266	2546689	that will be coming out for Wii.
2548070	2548891	That sounds interesting.
2549291	2551393	I love those little quirky games.
2552494	2560462	Now, you know, Resident Evil 4 was badass on the GameCube and was really like the last kick in the butt that system had, I mean, in the right direction.
2560503	2561383	So what do you think?
2561443	2566168	Is Resident Evil Wii going to be like the holy crap, Nintendo's not just cutesy things type game?
2566609	2567870	I have a feeling it's going to do that.
2568166	2570588	There's also another game that was mentioned.
2571109	2574032	Hajime Tano Wii, which means starting out with Wii.
2574472	2576474	It's supposed to be one of the launch titles.
2576995	2580038	And it's supposed to be a bunch of mini-games with the duck hunt.
2580138	2582600	Are you guys getting used to that name now?
2583181	2583381	Wii?
2583941	2584802	I think it's cute.
2585463	2585763	I don't know.
2586124	2586924	I think it's the right thing.
2586944	2588826	I think Nintendo's making a lot of smart decisions here.
2589227	2591489	What was it that I said months ago?
2592165	2592365	What?
2592825	2600530	The whole point of advertising, when you come up with a name for something, you need something memorable, something that people are going to talk about.
2601850	2602631	Something simple.
2603631	2604552	And it fits all three.
2604732	2607073	And boy, the internet would not shut up about Wii.
2607173	2611796	Check any game blog or major gaming site or little gaming site and it was Wii, Wii, Wii.
2611856	2614037	Unless, you know, it was an Xbox or Sony site.
2614337	2616678	It was all about the Wii all this week.
2616858	2618719	There is rarely such a thing as bad press.
2618739	2619900	I always say rarely, not ever.
2620325	2620685	Sonya and E3
2639153	2639613	Thanks for watching!
2653283	2654504	I'm sure Charum's going to yell it out.
2654864	2657385	I want to say December 8th, for some reason it sticks out of my mind.
2657465	2657905	I don't know why.
2658065	2659466	Maybe that's because it was the Europe launch.
2659486	2659746	I don't know.
2660026	2667850	But anyway, what's interesting is that there's a pretty big difference between the GameCube version and the Wii version of Twilight Princess, and that is how Link is holding his sword.
2668371	2682358	Miyamoto stated that Link was initially supposed to have a left-handed sword in the Wii version of Twilight Princess, but he has that in the GameCube version, and they changed it so that he uses a sword in the right hand on the Wii because of the fact that most people are right-handed.
2682738	2682898	Well,
2683537	2693800	I always thought it was very strange having Link be left-handed anyway because isn't it in Japan it's sort of a thing where a lot of parents will train their children to be right-handed.
2694200	2699001	Being left-handed is very, I guess, considered not very normal.
2699221	2701042	Chatroom's all yelling December 11th, by the way.
2701082	2701782	Thank you, Chatroom.
2701942	2703743	Why can't they make Tingle less gay then?
2704183	2706303	If they can teach Link to use the other hand.
2706323	2707384	Hey, Tingle ain't coming out here.
2708444	2709124	I can say this because
2709522	2711824	I think on GayGamer.net, I want to say, was the site.
2712024	2715806	They're starting a petition right now to get Tingle out over here, because right now it's not planned for release over here.
2715886	2717267	The Tingle Adventure.
2717367	2726073	That uber gay guy in the, well, at least it's, you know, we all think he is, in that GameCube Four Swords Adventures.
2726974	2730056	No, actually, he flies by on a balloon and goes, oh!
2731275	2732576	and drops rupees on him.
2732596	2734176	Well, he was actually in Wind Waker.
2734597	2735217	Oh, that's right.
2735717	2736338	Alright, thank you.
2736438	2737518	I just remember him from Four Swords.
2737538	2741620	I'm going to have to import that because I like... Yeah.
2742300	2743881	You like to feel a little tingle?
2744401	2747943	No, I just like... I like the gay.
2749624	2758048	Anyway, speaking of... No, I'm sorry, not speaking of... The interface for the Wii, we've got some very interesting things going on.
2758668	2759408	There is...
2761833	2764577	Excuse me as I die over here.
2764777	2771144	There is going to be, it's actually based on Opera for their web browser.
2771665	2775650	There's a weather channel, a news channel, and then there's one called me channel.
2776611	2779334	M-I-I for those who haven't got the joke yet.
2780828	2809078	with the me channel you can use that to customize your avatar and also your avatar will show up in the various demos you can actually store everything on your Wii remote so you will actually be taking your Wii remote to other people's houses and play which I've been listening to some other podcasts kind of not getting that
2809682	2810342	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2841364	2857094	There actually, if anyone is interested, there are videos up on Eurogamer.net, linked over from Eurogamer TV, that give demonstrations of how these various screens and channels are going to work on the Wii.
2857515	2859136	So I recommend checking those out.
2859496	2859876	Very cool.
2859896	2861778	And I know I saw some on Wii.com, too.
2861998	2862218	Oh, yeah.
2862238	2863099	Some good stuff, too.
2864159	2869303	I want to point out this comment, and I know I'm not supposed to say these words because they were banned, but it's a funny comment.
2870036	2885689	Sioran108 in our chatroom says Tingle gets more guys than G4 in regards to Tingle.
2887010	2896257	As Jamie mentioned earlier, there's a brand new Wii game which roughly translates to my first Wii.
2896277	2899360	The game's actually going to be bundled with a Wiimote and
2900436	2902957	It will be, yes, my first Wii.
2903237	2904177	Everybody poops!
2904677	2907318	No, no, that's translated that wrong.
2907338	2908538	It says starting with Wii.
2908858	2909639	Starting with Wii.
2911299	2913300	Starting with Wii, and then you go to poo.
2913440	2914040	Okay, anyways.
2915100	2917521	So, yeah, it's going to be... Wii is number one!
2918381	2919821	It's going to be bundled... Poo is number two!
2921462	2924743	It's going to be bundled... I'm glad we got that out of our system.
2924783	2928844	...together for 4,800 yen, making it cheaper than the standard controller, which would be 5,800 yen.
2931215	2932836	So that's actually kind of cool.
2933296	2937758	And it's set for the Japanese release on December 2nd.
2938179	2954588	And we'll include, of course, mini-games designed to make players familiar with the Wii remote controls, including pinball, table hockey, and pool, simple point-and-click shooting games, and other games that are modeled after the demos shown at E3 and
2955888	2960731	including a minigame where you move your Mii caricature around a city block.
2962072	2964113	So, interesting.
2964433	2964733	Alright.
2965313	2974699	Now, one thing that the Wii is going to be able to do that is kind of interesting, and it's kind of interesting that Xbox 360 doesn't do this, and I don't know if PlayStation has plans to do this, but that's surfing the web.
2975219	2985665	And I can see where Xbox 360 doesn't do this, because they want you to go use Windows on your PC to go, you know, surf the internet, but Nintendo, you know, they don't have a PC stake, so they say, fuck that, you're going to surf the web on our, uh,
2986069	2986709	www.darksakura.com
3008238	3009800	No idea why they're doing it that way.
3009840	3015745	I thought at first when I read this, this meant that the browser wasn't going to be out until June of next year, but that's not what the internet seems to be reporting right now.
3015765	3020369	It seems to be saying that, yeah, the Opera browser will be there, and you can download it free, but in June of next year, you're going to have to pay for it.
3021209	3024232	So, I guess a bonus incentive to early adopters of the Wii?
3024372	3024772	I guess.
3025433	3032919	The other thing, too, is, I mean, it's probably not that expensive to develop the Opera browser in the sense that it's normally free anyways.
3034042	3035283	That's probably why they're charging after.
3035303	3040146	It's kind of like the whole thing that they did with Texas Hold'em, where it's free for 48 hours.
3040166	3042187	Yeah, but Texas Hold'em was free for two days.
3042247	3044248	This is going to be free for about seven months.
3044609	3049352	Well, you know, not a lot of people are going to be really jumping to download the browser.
3049912	3056456	Because, I mean, if you think about it, to browse the internet, you really got to have a wireless setup and all that stuff.
3057379	3063922	For the Wii, so... Well, wait, but isn't the Wii supposed to have the wireless thing built into it, just like your DS, so that all you have to have is a wireless router in your house and it'll go?
3064062	3067223	Exactly, but still, though, I mean, not a lot of people have that, I would think.
3067303	3071065	Do you think people without wireless internet are going to be screwed, or do you think there'll be a dongle like there was for DS?
3071085	3072705	No, there's going to be a USB type of thing.
3072785	3074146	Same that they had with the DS.
3074166	3074726	That's what I figured.
3075987	3080569	Well, speaking of things that are screwed up... Monkey Ball.
3081369	3081629	Okay.
3081649	3081729	Okay.
3082188	3084249	Monkey Ball is just one of those crazy games that's out there.
3084269	3090190	And of course, as everyone knows by now, there is a Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz that will be out on the Wii.
3090890	3095032	But they're introducing two new characters, one called Yan Yan and one called Doctor.
3096692	3099413	Yan Yan is a female monkey.
3100093	3101773	And Yan Yan is a doctor.
3102273	3107355	Sorry, Doctor is an older monkey with a past steeped in mystery due to his acute case of amnesia.
3107575	3107995	That's a quote.
3108095	3109716	Is his name Dr. Seuss?
3110596	3111336	He just says Doctor.
3112230	3116691	And in my head, I'm a Doctor Who fangirl, so every time I see Doctor, I think, David Tennant?
3117071	3117311	No!
3117931	3120752	Now I have this image of David Tennant dressed as a monkey in my head.
3121232	3121572	I can't.
3121992	3123012	And now I need to wash my brain.
3124973	3126013	David Tennant's hot, but anyway.
3126933	3127353	Okie dokie.
3127373	3128033	So is Billy Piper.
3128533	3130154	But back to the story.
3131574	3141216	There's also, each of these characters are going to have different strengths and weaknesses, things that affect acceleration, speed, jumping, also the weight and size of the ball that they are in.
3141767	3144730	is going to affect how it's played.
3146351	3148453	Actually, you use the ball in different ways.
3148473	3149914	You can flick the remote.
3149974	3151015	You can press a button.
3151615	3154658	Different things that you do with the remote are going to affect how the balls move.
3155318	3159161	And there's also a bunch of mini-games.
3159422	3162524	It will be out on December 2nd in Japan.
3163585	3167188	Sorry, the grade schooler in me is using the Wii to make your balls move.
3167228	3169550	It's just too much for me.
3169810	3170771	It will be a launch game.
3171178	3181003	So, in all territories I just want to say some chat comments real quick PooEater on the Opera Story in our chatroom says Why would you want the internet on your console which has to run from your computer's internet connection?
3181563	3190908	I don't know, there's something to be said about multiple browser windows Maybe mom wants one browsing window and you want one, I don't know And also, I mean, browsing from your couch and PORN!
3191068	3191748	Come on!
3192288	3193569	Oh, I can't wait to put porn on my Wii
3194302	3198063	Raven's Dolphin wanted to correct me and say that PlayStation 3 does indeed have a browser in it.
3198143	3198504	Thank you.
3198564	3199244	I couldn't remember.
3199344	3202965	I figured as much because PSP has one, but I couldn't remember for sure.
3204766	3215530	Anyway, speaking of the browser, they are testing the online service, or I should say it's rumored that they are beta testing the online service right now.
3215690	3221692	I don't know how reputable this is, but this is according to a poster on the MacRumorsForum.com.
3222682	3223982	I have problems with that right there.
3224383	3228604	Anyways, who has fairly reputable history when it comes to Nintendo-related information.
3229004	3231485	Why he's posting on Mac... Whatever, anyways.
3232705	3241808	Saying that the beta test is running from September 18th until October 23rd, and the test will be covering the Wii Connect 24, Virtual Console, and other online features.
3243389	3244009	Right.
3244069	3246770	Okay, so they're beta testing the online service.
3247110	3247410	Great.
3247430	3249451	You know, that's something that they need to do.
3250091	3252232	Since, you know, the console is coming out pretty soon.
3254028	3254288	What?
3255509	3255929	Nothing.
3256709	3258670	I'm a really Mac fangirl in the house.
3259451	3259951	No, that's not true.
3259991	3260471	I like Macs.
3260531	3261012	I have a Mac.
3261192	3264513	I'm getting my... Oh, did you see the 24-inch iMacs?
3266875	3267635	The bigger the better.
3268195	3269456	Why do you need something that big?
3270196	3270737	For art.
3270817	3275199	I'm being told that that's not a rumor and that's the truth, apparently.
3275719	3276680	They're 24-inch widescreen iMacs.
3281446	3285408	My internet penis knows no bounds.
3286648	3291410	Moving on, another question that still is up for debate right now.
3291470	3295892	We have not really gotten a clear answer on this story, and it has to do with the region-free.
3296012	3297933	Is the damn thing going to be region-free or not?
3298273	3302515	And it seems to be that it's America versus the rest of the world.
3303475	3305736	I mean Nintendo of America versus Nintendo of the rest of the world.
3306038	3308358	Debating on whether the damn thing is going to be region free or not.
3308939	3316560	Basically what happened is that, okay, Perrin Kaplan, who's the VP of Marketing and Corporate Affairs, she said that yes, like the Nintendo DS, the Wii is going to be free.
3316880	3322441	But then, I believe some guy from Europe said that it is not going to be region free.
3323021	3331483	So, and then, I guess to further say what Perrin was saying is that she was saying, well, first party games will be region free, but we'll leave it up to the third party folks what they want to do.
3332063	3332243	So...
3332967	3334428	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3352023	3355006	and potentially regionless third party titles was indeed correct.
3355286	3356927	The Wii will be region free.
3357248	3360270	So Nintendo of America is convinced the damn thing is going to be region free.
3360770	3363673	So I don't know why the rest of the world isn't on the same page.
3363833	3367216	I hope so because I want to get Wii Play and my first Wii.
3367716	3372961	And if something like, you know, Oendan comes out for the Wii, you damn well better believe I want that shit.
3373121	3374382	But you know what though?
3375532	3380235	I have a feeling that even if it's not, we're going to get something like what came out on the GameCube.
3383177	3383797	What was it called?
3384798	3388541	The thing that basically overrode the region thing and swapped out the disc.
3390802	3393064	Oh, that whole swap trick.
3393084	3394685	Use little hacks to do it.
3394845	3398527	Especially if Nintendo's letting you on the internet with their console.
3398547	3401529	You know what a huge fucking hole that's going to be, I bet, to hackers?
3403170	3404311	The whole thing about Nintendo...
3406090	3411977	All of their systems have been the easiest to play imports on.
3412157	3417042	For Super Famicom games, all you needed to do was find an old Gyromite.
3417503	3421427	Not for Super Famicom, but for Famicom, you needed an old Gyromite and you could plug it in.
3422126	3425790	or with the Super Nintendo, you break out two little tabs, plug it in.
3426390	3433758	With the Nintendo 64, they sold actually a little tool that you could unscrew and then you pop another tab, put it in.
3434378	3438542	Those were all physical lockouts until they started moving to digital format.
3439083	3442446	And then with that, it was still something as easy as loading a code.
3442466	3444268	It was like the Dreamcast, how easy that was.
3444798	3452200	And then I have a feeling that even if they go back and it's all region coded, they're still going to have some way to bypass that.
3452240	3454360	And I really don't think Nintendo's going to care.
3454780	3456501	They haven't cared before, really.
3457181	3458401	Why should they really care?
3459181	3460542	Bobby Blackwolf's in our chat right now.
3460582	3462462	He does his own show over on allgames.com.
3462482	3466083	I'm sure if you've listened to this show for any length of time, you've heard us pimp him before.
3466505	3475673	He ran the same story on his show tonight, except he was reading Joystick's version of it, and I guess Joystick talked to Nintendo as well, and they told him, no, it's not region free.
3476034	3480658	So, shit, even with the Nintendo of America, they don't know.
3482219	3484982	So we won't know until the damn thing comes out, it sounds like.
3485282	3485942	You know what, though?
3486203	3487844	I'm still really...
3489426	3493069	I can't be too upset about that because there's going to be a way.
3493390	3494250	Yeah, there'll be a way.
3494290	3508083	Even if Nintendo doesn't do something, even if we don't have a developer do something, there is going to be some importer on the net, the same people who probably figured out how to do the seven swap trick on the old PlayStation, who will figure out a way to play imports.
3508103	3510485	Well, it's just like the Xbox 360 games.
3510505	3513188	There are some that come out that are region-free, and then you can import them.
3513508	3515750	You just won't know until they come out, so...
3516818	3519419	I guess it's one of those things they didn't think people were going to ask about.
3520660	3522360	What do you mean you want games from other regions?
3522380	3523141	What the hell is wrong with you?
3523521	3526362	They know there are importers there.
3526402	3532565	I remember paying $125 for the Sailor Moon S fighting game back in 1995.
3532885	3534145	Because you're fucking sick.
3536446	3538767	And I mean that with lots of love.
3538787	3542229	This was when it was brand new and I had to pay import fees.
3543331	3549096	and I paid for it and I bought it and I played the hell out of it and sold it back used for $60 after two years.
3549917	3555882	But still, there are people out there who will lay down the money and will do what it takes to get their imports out.
3556983	3557183	Cool.
3557844	3564029	Anyways, some of the news that was coming out of Japan was actually a huge list of games that they're going to be getting for the Wii.
3564329	3566491	I thought there was a lot of stuff that was very interesting in there.
3567252	3569434	Some of the titles, at least the highlights on there,
3570676	3574619	some to-be-announced titles, for example.
3574979	3579903	There's an action game, an action RPG that's being worked on from software.
3580603	3585747	A baseball game being worked on by Konami Digital Entertainment, so that might be interesting.
3586868	3590871	Bomberman Land, Smash Bros., which, of course, we knew was coming.
3591611	3593452	Disaster, also another Nintendo game.
3593492	3597876	Donkey Kong Tarou Jet Race, which is going to be coming out in 2007.
3597916	3598436	Dragon Quest...
3601399	3626973	Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, The Crystal Bearer from Square Enix New Fire Emblem game from Nintendo As well as Harry Potter from EA, of course Mario Party 8, not a big surprise there Mario Strikers Charge, which had been previously announced This one I thought was very interesting Music Simulation game, of course a working title from Konami Digital Entertainment So, very interesting there
3628015	3630777	Super Paper Mario Super Paper Mario Super Paper Mario Super Paper Mario
3652193	3654615	Pac-Man Carnival One Piece Unlimited Adventure Wii Music Totsugeki Famicom Wars W
3682695	3684696	I actually do not know what Totokeki means.
3685297	3686237	Maybe someone in chat knows.
3686257	3686718	Let me see.
3687659	3688479	Oh, Advanced Wars.
3688579	3688980	I'm sorry.
3689060	3690141	Okay, yeah, so that's what that is.
3690161	3691021	Good job, Junami.
3691382	3703471	Yeah, I was thinking, because I was like, that sounds familiar, but... My thought, okay, the Konami music game, just bear with me on this, since it's probably something new for the Wii, I would bet this series is cute enough for Nintendo.
3703972	3709096	I bet it's going to be some twisted form of poppin' music, but not with the controller like we know it.
3709156	3710977	It's going to be like a different type of poppin' music.
3711138	3711538	Theory.
3712259	3714180	Hi, weird-ass theory for me.
3714241	3715501	No theory here.
3716302	3720825	Motion Sensing Controller, music game, Drum Mania.
3721566	3721946	You think?
3722907	3727770	Actually, you know, they did have one of the demos at E3 was a drumming sim.
3727871	3733415	But wasn't, isn't that Wii music thing supposed to be a separate game with the orchestra and that whole thing from Nintendo?
3733435	3735256	I don't think it has a drumming thing on there.
3735276	3736817	The Wii music is just the orchestra.
3737177	3737758	But, um...
3739045	3739985	You know, I don't know.
3740025	3742046	Chatroom seems to think it's Parapara.
3742106	3743327	We're not going to get Parapara.
3743367	3745448	The whole Parapara thing is so... Wait, wait, wait.
3745508	3746248	This isn't for us.
3746308	3747309	It's Japan we're talking about.
3747329	3747989	That's what I'm saying.
3748229	3750110	Parapara is pretty much dead in Japan.
3751070	3754312	It was a fad that lasted for like, what, five years?
3754372	3755472	Maybe it's something new.
3756893	3758874	Maybe it's like ganguro dancing or something.
3758934	3759334	I don't know.
3760194	3762615	Unfortunately, the ganguro did not die with the Parapara.
3763756	3764076	Mambo-Gogo?
3764096	3765177	Mambo-Gogo would be cool.
3765317	3766297	That would be badass.
3766337	3768498	But anyway, so... Well...
3769102	3782267	Speaking of other games, we have coming out for the Virtual Console, Hudson, who loves us so much, will be bringing 30 titles over for Virtual Console.
3783427	3785348	Some of them will be available at launch.
3785548	3787169	They haven't listed exactly what.
3787809	3795232	My speculation is we will be probably getting the Adventure Island series, probably the various Bombermans.
3797378	3799460	Those are two I definitely think are going to be up there.
3801001	3801361	And Bonk.
3802321	3805183	I think I definitely... Well, especially if they're doing TurboGrafx.
3805843	3807845	You cannot have TurboGrafx without Bonk.
3809225	3810326	Or Air Zonk.
3810486	3811107	That's another good one.
3811127	3812747	This is one that Junomi suggested.
3813288	3814929	But I still want my Adventure Island.
3817010	3820292	Well, another company that's talking about games coming over to the Wii.
3820552	3825495	Actually, this one kind of leaked out from the ESRB ratings board there.
3825936	3840066	We've got a listing for a bunch of different Wii titles for the Virtual Console, including Altered Beast, Columns, Echo the Dolphin, Golden Axe, Ristar, Sonic the Hedgehog, and ToeJam & Earl.
3840947	3842588	All of which are getting an E rating.
3843068	3845250	Oh god, I can't wait to play ToeJam & Earl again.
3846089	3850013	What do you think, though, about the whole $5, $8, $10 thing?
3850033	3851714	Do you think that's going to be worth it for those old games?
3852014	3854777	They didn't really say where Genesis and TurboGrafx fits into that, though.
3854797	3861763	They just said, you know, 500 points for the old games, 800 for the SNES, and 1,000 for the later ones, Nintendo 64.
3861943	3866147	You know, I do, though, have to second something that was mentioned in the chat room.
3867408	3870651	Bob Coffee said we need to get Dracula X. All right.
3871175	3881720	We have to get one of our biggest Nintendo fans on the Skype line right now because he's dying to comment on some of this because he knows a few things that we don't and we're going to see what we can get out of him here on the show.
3882300	3883260	DMN, are you on the line?
3884161	3886082	Yeah, you got your $20 bills out?
3886322	3887902	Why, are you going to dance?
3889083	3889403	Maybe.
3889703	3891344	Did you dress up for this phone call?
3892664	3893145	Wait, what?
3893585	3894725	Did you dress up for this phone call?
3894885	3896466	He's dressed sexy for episode 200.
3896546	3898467	I'm actually not wearing any clothes right now.
3902205	3906447	D.M.N., I know you're dying to comment on this.
3906507	3908008	What do you think about all this news this week?
3908048	3911310	And now you can actually talk about some of the things you couldn't before, I'm sure.
3912310	3913070	Yeah, a few things.
3913231	3919354	One of the things I want to say is this is the most excited I've been for a console launch since about Nintendo 64.
3921548	3931256	I would agree with that, except I would go as far back to say I have not been this excited about a console at launch, keeping those words in mind, at launch, since Super Nintendo.
3932077	3932958	Yeah, that's another one.
3935019	3947590	What I want to say about the Wii is, you know, having had a chance to dabble playing it a little bit, we did have a little demo thing over the week for all Nintendo employees.
3948350	3949751	It's incredibly fun.
3951454	3953376	Elebits, looks amazing.
3954697	3957219	Got a chance to try out a demo of WarioWare, which is amazing.
3957599	3958320	It's really fun.
3961242	3968688	What else can I... Madden 07, I got to play like a couple plays of that, and that may be the most fun anybody will have with a sim sports game ever.
3968888	3970870	Are you biased because you're on Reggie's payroll?
3971571	3971771	No.
3972712	3972912	No?
3973552	3973692	No.
3973712	3974493	Swear to me.
3975034	3976355	I'm getting a 360 at some point.
3976595	3977796	I'm just not getting a PS3.
3977896	3979097	So you're in the Wii 60 camp?
3979818	3980018	Yes.
3980218	3980418	All right.
3981004	3981424	Fair enough.
3981805	3982665	Well, what else?
3982705	3984647	Anything else you can tell us about the Wii?
3984967	3985247	Maybe?
3985528	3985908	Little bits?
3985928	3986729	Little hints?
3987429	3999419	I'm trying to see... I don't want to get you fired, so I understand if no, but... There's not really anything else I can talk about because I know just about as much as you guys do in some aspects.
4001521	4005304	But there's some things I can't talk about because of obvious reasons.
4005564	4005804	Right.
4006785	4006885	Um...
4008618	4009458	Yeah, that's about it.
4009638	4009898	Okay.
4010118	4010858	Alright, well, that's cool.
4010878	4016459	Well, we'll take your word for it, because you've probably seen the Wii more recently than any of the rest of us, so... Yeah.
4016479	4018400	So you actually got hands-on with Elebits?
4018420	4025041	Because I saw it at the Konami thing, but I didn't get to play it, really, because all the Corpcasts were hogging the shit out of it, and we weren't really able to get on it.
4025941	4029161	I will say, right here and now, it will be a Katamari Damacy killer.
4029762	4031082	Oh, well, I don't know about that.
4031602	4032222	I don't know about that.
4032242	4034462	I will put money on that with you, Rob.
4034602	4035663	Loki, you saw this, too?
4035723	4037963	You think Elebits is the Katamari killer?
4038502	4039062	I don't think so.
4039242	4039522	No.
4040022	4040223	No.
4040423	4040903	I don't think so.
4040963	4041443	It's fun.
4041523	4043443	It's going to appeal to the same type of people.
4043543	4047124	Yeah, I think it's going to appeal to the same crowd, but I don't think it'll sell nearly as many copies.
4047224	4048965	Now, they do need to release Katamari for it, though.
4049165	4049445	They do.
4049945	4050685	Yeah, it'll be interesting.
4050705	4054086	But it won't be the same guy, because he said he's not doing any more Katamari.
4054186	4054767	I guess that's true.
4055147	4055587	Who cares?
4055827	4056407	Just port it.
4057507	4059428	What makes you think that Elebits is a Katamari killer?
4060899	4062560	Just how incredibly fun it was.
4062600	4064300	It was easy to just pick up and play.
4064481	4069683	It took me maybe 30 seconds just to get used to what I was doing, and it was clockwork from there.
4070123	4072704	It felt just as fun as a Katamari game and just as simple.
4073004	4076225	Isn't that how most Wii games are designed, though, that you just kind of pick it up and go?
4076785	4078846	Yeah, absolutely.
4079046	4087689	Basically, for those who don't know, Elevates is basically a game where, let's say you're playing Half-Life 2 in just a random part of the neighborhood, and the only thing you have is the gravity gun.
4087729	4088850	That's pretty much what it is.
4089410	4089610	Hmm.
4090262	4092343	Interesting.
4093963	4098084	Will I be able to sell a Wii to my mom?
4098264	4098845	If you want.
4099345	4103166	I mean, is this really the type of console that's going to appeal to everyone, you think?
4103886	4104566	Oh, absolutely.
4105747	4113689	I was actually telling my own mother about it, who absolutely loves video games, and she actually even seemed interested in trying it when I bought it.
4114129	4118211	I think that this is the direction that gaming needs to go.
4118591	4119251	We need to
4119827	4124930	Be more a part of the game rather than, you know, I don't want top-notch graphics.
4125230	4127852	I don't want incredibly difficult controls.
4127892	4130874	I just want a game I can pick up and play and enjoy and have fun with.
4131274	4132255	Okay, interesting.
4132295	4140480	And that's why we're not seeing as much of the 360, and from what Sony's doing, it's just not looking like it.
4141286	4141566	All right.
4141887	4144209	But what do you think might happen with Sony in a year?
4144269	4155960	Because remember, the PlayStation and PlayStation 2 launches, I think for people who play the same type of games we do, we're not really in the we buy Madden games the day they come out camp.
4156560	4160603	And granted, there's a great fan base for that, and I'm not knocking that if that's what you're into.
4161023	4169949	But do you think that maybe for us who are more of the, you know, we like to play quirky music games and Japanese RPGs camp, do you think that Sony might win us over in a year?
4170009	4178475	Because I truly believe it right now that Sony may be able to shnagle a price drop and some great games in a year that, you know, don't count PS3 out.
4180017	4181979	I'm trying to be as open-minded as possible about this.
4182599	4184420	I definitely wouldn't count Sony out.
4184501	4186242	It's just the price that's killing them.
4186362	4190085	I think if they release a Final Fantasy and a Kingdom Hearts, yeah, absolutely.
4190125	4190785	Those are going to sell PS3s.
4191486	4192126	All right.
4193568	4197551	I know tons of people who, if Kingdom Hearts 3 comes out, they will drop what they're doing and go buy a PS3.
4197631	4197891	Chris?
4198491	4199352	Chris is nodding her head.
4199392	4199812	That's me.
4199973	4200313	That's me.
4201474	4201734	All right.
4201954	4204856	DMM, we've got to let you go because we've got to get to our next round of DDR sneak peeks.
4204876	4206077	But thanks so much for calling in.
4206117	4206658	We appreciate it.
4207298	4208239	Oh, one more thing.
4208399	4208619	Okay.
4208639	4209060	One more thing.
4209120	4209340	Yes?
4209912	4219155	While we're talking about the Wii, you all need to listen to Orange Lounge Radio on November the 19th because I will be in studio with a Wii to give to somebody.
4220095	4225017	And the other thing, since he couldn't share some info about the Wii, I figured I could.
4225559	4227040	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4254022	4254542	Thanks so much.
4254602	4255542	You're a true fan, DMM.
4255582	4255902	We love you.
4256683	4256943	All right.
4257043	4257583	Take care, guys.
4257623	4258163	Have a good one, buddy.
4258183	4258483	Thanks.
4258803	4258963	Bye.
4259003	4260983	What do you know on release dates?
4261304	4270885	Well, as we know, there's only really two Nintendo first-party titles that are launching with Wii in the United States, including Excite Truck and, of course, Zelda Twilight Princess.
4271186	4281488	However, shortly afterwards, we will be getting the next in first-party games, which will be WarioWare Smooth Moves, which is coming to us on January 16, 2007.
4283906	4293709	The other thing which is very interesting, as I mentioned before, Sonic the Secret of the Rings, of course not a launch title, also confirmed by the launch games that were coming out.
4293990	4298371	It is in the launch window, I guess, but it's coming out March 7th, 2007.
4298451	4304593	So lots of big stuff coming from Sega in March, and I'll get into that a little bit later.
4305453	4309555	And of course, Super Paper Mario, delayed on the GameCube until the 15th of December.
4310660	4313102	possibly on the Wii in the United States.
4313382	4313742	I don't know.
4314543	4315764	Kind of foggy on that.
4316084	4316565	Interesting.
4316885	4317205	All right.
4317705	4320568	Well, I think that about covers all the Wii news we wanted to do tonight.
4320628	4326672	So now I want to go around to everybody, our guests included, and I want to ask you guys, what do you think now after all this news?
4326792	4327873	Are you sold on the Wii?
4328213	4330355	Were you disappointed with the news you heard this week?
4330615	4332457	Or are you happy with the news you heard this week?
4333057	4335559	Is Nintendo going to win the next round of the console wars?
4336119	4336640	What do you think?
4336820	4338401	We'll start it off with Drew.
4338541	4339502	Drew Nami, what do you think?
4340656	4349119	Personally, I've been sold on the Wii since the E3 announcements, but I know there's a lot of anti-Nintendo people out there.
4349619	4352560	Despite all that, I think Nintendo's got the routine down pat.
4352620	4355220	Do one thing, do it really well, do it with innovation.
4356641	4361862	I think they're definitely going to score second, if not first, in the console wars for this generation.
4363043	4363323	Loki.
4365383	4367744	The only disappointment I have is that it's not coming out sooner.
4368804	4372725	The price is fine, because I figured that's about the price I was going to pay for it anyways.
4372785	4382067	And I know I've got to buy lots of accessories for it, because I take this thing to work, I play with my friends, and I've got to have enough controllers for everybody, because they're broke asses.
4382507	4384487	So, you know, that's fine.
4386228	4390028	The only thing I'm just worried about is I want to make sure I get one on launch.
4390128	4393649	That's my only concern right now, and I'm trying to cover my bases with that.
4394478	4401180	And I'm really hoping that they, you know, I do like what they've got coming out as far as games and stuff.
4401200	4404100	I think we're going to see a lot of really cool, innovative things with it.
4404880	4407321	I'm very interested to see these Wii channels.
4407381	4415263	I don't really give a crap about the news too much, but, you know, some of the stuff's pretty cool, like the photo channel.
4415363	4415963	It's pretty neat.
4416663	4416863	All right.
4417587	4419889	Some quick chat comments, then we'll get Chris's feedback.
4420350	4427395	Knights in our chat says, The two weeks when Gears of War, the PS3, and the Wii come out, I will feel sorry for everyone at GameStop and EB Games.
4428336	4432480	Anush in our chat says, I think Sony is going to make it again, but I have no problem with Nintendo.
4432560	4435602	I'll buy a Wii, too, but Sony comes before Microsoft for me.
4436103	4436823	Chris, what are your thoughts?
4437544	4437864	You know what?
4437904	4443949	I don't really get sold on games or the systems that they come with too easily.
4444109	4446291	It sounds cool, but I don't know if I'm going to get one at launch.
4447160	4451001	Just because I'm really picky about the games that I do have.
4454121	4459722	Just getting the PS2, which is the only one I've got so far, and some Game Boys.
4459822	4463743	Even that, that took Kingdom Hearts to go get.
4464403	4467023	It's got to be a good game for me to go get it, so I probably won't get it at launch.
4467043	4472784	But it sounds really good, and I'm sure you're going to hear Megzi talk about it constantly, so I'll get enough news from it.
4472965	4474845	Here's the thing, my big thing about the Wii...
4476275	4487257	The vibe I get from the Wii is the same vibe I get from thinking about playing Castle Crashers or old arcade games like the four-player coin-op games.
4487397	4489278	That kind of vibe where it's fun.
4489318	4495599	You have your friends over, you put some chips on the table or something, and you all play a fun game together.
4495659	4497239	That's the kind of vibe I get from it.
4497599	4497819	All right.
4498179	4500960	Quick chat comment, then we'll get my thoughts, and then DarkSakura.
4501580	4504341	Bob Coffee says in our chat, I think Nintendo's got it.
4504501	4505961	Sony's just making too many mistakes.
4506325	4508489	The real battle will be here in North America.
4509811	4510413	My thoughts.
4510733	4516865	You know, not since the original 8-bit Nintendo has a word...
4518120	4518901	Thanks for watching!
4538755	4541697	so that, you know, it's going to appeal to everyone.
4541737	4543377	I mean, you can just pick this thing up and go.
4543738	4549020	I do know people that are turned off by Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 because it's just, you know, too many buttons.
4549381	4550041	Too damn many buttons.
4550081	4550641	Too much to do.
4551221	4553763	And I think this is going to be the one that sells it to the families.
4554023	4559446	I think for the hardcore of hardcore gamers, there's another battle that's going to be fought there between 360 and PS3.
4559686	4561006	But I think this is what Nintendo wants.
4561046	4564168	Nintendo is trying to go after the casual gamer and I think they're going to get it.
4564468	4565889	And I think the Wii, if not
4566109	4566989	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4594301	4600443	But as long as we consistently are getting new games that keep our interest, I think we've got the potential to do amazingly.
4600703	4601543	DarkSakura, your thoughts?
4602783	4613486	First of all, just to go back to what you were saying about Xerox, I remember there being an ad back in the 80s where Xerox would say, this is not a generic.
4614186	4615427	Please don't use this as a generic.
4615607	4620448	Nintendo is on its way to having their entire corporate name being used as a generic term for games.
4621068	4623369	In terms of business, that hurts them.
4624270	4630312	So I disagree with that, just after what I've studied in business law.
4631072	4637894	But I do agree, though, that they have been the big innovators.
4638754	4641475	I wanted a Wii when it was a revolution.
4643776	4647517	There's never been a doubt that if Nintendo puts out a system, I am going to own it.
4648803	4657047	So, that's all I... You know, Nintendo could put out a cardboard box and call it the Pooh, and I would buy it.
4659989	4661289	Jamie, you're gullible.
4662050	4662770	Have I ever told you that?
4663790	4664331	I am not.
4664451	4665791	If it's Nintendo, it's going to be good.
4665811	4667312	They've always put out quality products.
4667472	4668473	Pooh is not good!
4669653	4670013	Alright.
4670154	4673295	It was an example.
4673575	4675036	I didn't mean to buy Pooh.
4675956	4677339	Alright, well those are our opinions.
4677539	4678261	Take them or leave them.
4678702	4682269	We'd love to hear your opinions as well, not only in our chat room, but at our email bag.
4682350	4683833	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com
4684249	4685170	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4711451	4712191	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4735102	4738187	and tonight we're going to debut one of these power courses for you right now.
4738228	4739971	This one is from DDR Ultramix 4.
4740792	4742255	It is power course number 2.
4742776	4745742	It's the Stargaze mix by DJ Nagi.
4745802	4746123	Enjoy.
4817834	4826607	Listen to the words I'm saying, baby I found the ghost and it keeps me hanging
4847365	4848626	Thank you for watching!
4900429	4901673	Thanks for watching!
5085100	5088461	from DDR Ultramix 4 here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5088521	5090081	That is one of the new power courses.
5090121	5096342	That's power course number two as mixed by DJ Nagi, the Stargaze mix here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5097223	5101163	Now, I know a lot of you guys are dying to know what songs are in that list.
5101183	5102264	I want to know what the songs are.
5102904	5105704	Well, you'll find out when the game's released.
5106184	5109005	But in the meantime, you'll just have to speculate away.
5109045	5114006	And I'm sure if you play DDR Ultramix 2, you won't have a hard time figuring out one of the songs in there at least.
5114923	5117747	But as far as the rest of it goes, we're supposed to keep a lid on it.
5118207	5119369	Sorry guys, have fun.
5120551	5125257	Alright, anyway, we're going to move on and, well, I don't know.
5125598	5126419	You think we ought to do some more?
5127861	5128261	Sure.
5128362	5129243	Alright, look, here.
5129263	5129343	Here.
5130488	5139655	Let's do some clips from some other courses as well, because I don't want to leave out DDR Universe, because DDR Universe has some non-stops as well, so we've got to show them a little love.
5139675	5141476	But we are a little pressed for time, so we're going to do some clips.
5141536	5145139	So here's a clip of one of the non-stops from DDR Universe.
5145179	5150163	This is the Acid Tech Mix, also by DJ Nagi here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5202430	5203230	Thanks for watching!
5229213	5230074	Thanks for watching!
5253576	5254436	Thanks for watching!
5283115	5284216	Thanks for watching!
5327481	5328621	Thanks for watching!
5351986	5352907	Alright, we've got to cut it off.
5352947	5355468	We can't play too much or Konami Hawaii is going to get mad at us.
5355528	5360011	But here on Orange Launch Radio, that was from DDR Universe, a clip of Power Chorus number one.
5360612	5364094	And that is called the Acid Tech Mix by DJ Nagi.
5365515	5369518	You know, DJ Nagi is awesome and all, but we've got to play someone else, I think.
5369558	5373320	We need to do at least one more chorus so we can play someone else and show a different mixing style.
5373600	5374201	Wouldn't you agree?
5374641	5376082	Do you think they'd care if we played one more?
5376663	5376843	No.
5377043	5377303	Alright, well...
5377557	5378738	We'll do one more clip.
5378758	5380920	That's another course from DDR Ultramix 4.
5381540	5388866	This is the Steppin' Out Mix by Stillwind, a little clip so you can check out someone else's mixing skills here on the DDR Sneak Peeks.
5392309	5393170	Here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5413694	5415156	Thank you for watching!
5536593	5554863	Alright, we gotta turn it off, or else Konami's gonna write us some hate mail, and I don't wanna screw the rest of the DDR Sneak Peeks, but that was a look there at the Steppin' Out mix by Stillwind from DDR Ultramix 4, and dude, he mixed like happy hardcore into jazz swing 20s music there, I mean...
5555427	5556548	These courses are going to be nuts.
5556868	5558409	So that's just a taste of what's to come.
5558969	5561571	We will continue the DDR sneak peeks next week.
5561591	5567354	We're going to go back and look at two new tracks from DDR Ultramix 4 and two new tracks from DDR Universe.
5567414	5570656	And that will be next week, episode 201 of Orange Lounge Radio.
5571429	5577735	We're about ready to go to DDR, I'm sorry, OLR Part B here pretty soon.
5578295	5582439	Loki, you want to make a quick comment on something you thought was funny about the Supernova VRare, which came out this week?
5582699	5586203	Yeah, there's actually some interesting stuff about it.
5586243	5590867	The first thing, of course, the first track is actually a song called
5591617	5591997	L.E.F.
5618593	5632180	Which also, there's an artist in DDR called System SF, which created a song called, um, oh god, Feelings Won't Fade, which ripped off a System F song called Out of the Blue, which I thought that was very ironic.
5632920	5638223	Well, I guess they kissed and made up, and, you know, imitation is the highest form of flattery, isn't that what they say?
5638323	5643245	This is a photocopy of the song, it is that close, but, uh, all right.
