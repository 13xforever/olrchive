Orange Lounge Radio

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
We are that independent video game podcast dedicated to video games that don't suck and video game culture and the gamer lifestyle

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
I'm here to help you through it, my name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky

00:48.000 --> 00:55.000
Joining me as always, say hello to my lovely co-host in that corner, the one and only, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Hello

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
How you doing Missy?

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
I'm doing ok

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
I love your new shirt, will you please share with the listeners what your new shirt is and where you got this

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
What was that place called Chris?

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Oh God I forgot

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
It was some place on hate

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Apparently it's called Oh God I Forgot, is the name of the store

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
But on the front it says, oh oh army, in the back it says DarkSakura with a zero like a team jersey and it's red and black

01:17.000 --> 01:23.000
I want to get one and it's going to say Rob Roberts and the number 69

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
That would be awesome

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
Oh also over there, Loki what's your number going to be? Techmaster Loki

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
I guess 13 would be cool

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Or 666 would be good for you

01:35.000 --> 01:43.000
No we don't want to have too many 6's because you know the 6 and 9 both are kind of like 6's and then I'd have 666 that would just be too weird

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
That makes no sense at all but I like your shirt, you have a shirt that says Vader was framed

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
Yeah this I got as a gift from Eric and Melissa

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
Alright sounds good, happy early birthday

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
Matt's birthday is tomorrow September 11th, a day that is easy to remember

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
I mean I never forget Matt's birthday because it's easier to remember for some reason

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
Yeah because if you forget we'll drive another plane into a tower

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Moving right along

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
My birthday was the Waco deal

02:11.000 --> 02:19.000
Wow, you know what happened on my birthday? That's when the sodomy laws got overturned in Texas and Strom Thurmond died so hey we all got something special

02:19.000 --> 02:25.000
Alright say hello to an OLR favorite even though she's only been here for one episode

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Say hello to Chris

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Hi

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
How you doing Chris?

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
I'm okay, I got here kind of late and I fucked up your intro

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
That's okay see

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
By bringing you crack

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
The podcast listeners don't know that because we edit the show when we fuck up

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Oh okay

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
It's alright

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
The podcast listeners he fucked up

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
We had a faulty start this evening but that's alright

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
Say hello as well to a moldy favorite, Drunami

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
Yeah I mean you have to ask what my number is going to be

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Oh you're Drunami

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Yes I'm Drunami

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Oh okay

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
That's chatters meeting for the first time how cute

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
Yeah your number would be 23 because of your old call sign

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
Alright enough of the pleasantries let's get down to business

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
We like to play a little game here at Orange Lawns Radio at the start of every show

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
It's called How Is Your Gaming Week? Dark Sakura answer that question

03:12.000 --> 03:20.000
I played Tetris on Kristen's DS while having her hair done

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
I've never played DS while getting my hair done but that's a good thought

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
I was processing

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Do you have to put your hair on one of those giant dryers where you can't hear anything?

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
No she did

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Oh okay, oh you did?

03:29.000 --> 03:37.000
But it was while the diet because he touched up my roots and I have actually a black streak now on either side but you can't tell because I have my hair pulled back

03:37.000 --> 03:44.000
But I was sitting there playing Tetris and I couldn't see I had it right up in front of my face because I'm blind

03:44.000 --> 03:51.000
And so I ended up just playing that and actually I played pinball

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Did you guys get a new machine?

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
We got a new machine

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Because you called last week and you told us you had a machine

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
We have Star Trek The Next Generation and Dan's apparently been working on it the whole time I've been gone

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Right on

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Yeah

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Alright

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Loki anything you've been playing this week?

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
I played Saints Row

04:07.000 --> 04:13.000
I was bored during lunch one day so I tried climbing the mountain that's on the side of the map

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
Apparently there's an invisible wall so you can't do that

04:16.000 --> 04:23.000
But I was really high in the air so I decided to shoot rockets down at cars because that's of course the only thing you want to do if you're really high up in the air

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
So I did that and that was fun

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
And what else did I do?

04:27.000 --> 04:35.000
Oh I finished Blazing Angels finally have all 1000 achievement points now for it so I can sell it back

04:35.000 --> 04:41.000
That game you hate that you talk about in this segment every single week for like the past 15 weeks

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
I hate it I really do hate it but you know what it's done so

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
The talk of a true achievement point for

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Hey I have a question when it comes to achievement points

04:50.000 --> 04:57.000
Like I was looking at one of those sites that has like the leaderboards and will show you everybody's gamer score I think it was like mygamercard.net

04:57.000 --> 05:03.000
It's a big site that has that and like the person with the most points has like 53,000 gamers points

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
How does anyone on earth have the time to get that many points?

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
They all have a job and they live at home and they just play games all day all night

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Wow that's kind of sad

05:13.000 --> 05:20.000
Yeah it's ridiculous but whatever I mean if they want to spend the time to do that I'm not crazy like that

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
But I do like if I'm going to sell a game back I do want to make sure I have all the points out of it

05:25.000 --> 05:32.000
Or in the case of like the outfit I just don't fucking care because the game is so awful that I'll just sell it back without even touching it

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
I mean so whatever

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
We have another guest that's always with us every week and that is our chat room available at orangehonoredtrader.com

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
Click on chat and VidPala has a comment to all this

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
Gamer points are like the new e-peen as in e-penis

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
How was that noise?

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
It was somebody's cell phone

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
Please silence all cell phones before entering the studio

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
I thought my laptop was like making noise I'm like that's a noise I haven't heard yet

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Alright anything else you've been playing this week?

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
Grand Theft Auto of course I just played Grand Theft Auto on the PC too because I put it on my laptop

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
With the hot coffee mod because that's essential

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
And then what else have I been playing? I've played some live arcade stuff

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
I've actually been playing more like Galaga and stuff

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
And I actually tried well Nelly's been playing a lot Bejeweled 2

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
So I stole one of the games from her and I played that

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
And then yeah that was pretty much it though

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
I want to play more online for Saints Row but I'm waiting for the patch to come out

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Because it's supposed to be soon

06:32.000 --> 06:39.000
You know I saw you online this week on Xbox because you can see and I saw you were playing Bejeweled 2 and I was like loser

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
That's because it's Nelly she keeps playing Bejeweled 2

06:42.000 --> 06:49.000
And then I went to Majornelson.com and he has the list of the top Xbox games and now he's doing the arcade games too

06:49.000 --> 06:55.000
And Bejeweled 2 is like number 11, 13, somewhere around there and I'm like losers

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
So yeah

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
Bejeweled was cool like five years ago

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
It's the game she likes, the only game, she was playing Chloe and Clyde though earlier this week too

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
Which is impressive because that's like the game that you cannot get those gamer points ever

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
It's damn impossible

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
Bejeweled 2 has the hardest gamer points of any Xbox game I've played, period

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
I don't get it, I was looking at the leaderboards, there was someone that like did 250 levels of the main game

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
I'm like how do you even do that? That's one hell of a lucky game because

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
So yeah whatever

07:26.000 --> 07:31.000
Alrighty, let's go over to Drewnami, Drewnami how was your gaming week?

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
I played Bejeweled

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
For real?

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
For real

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
Are you a loser? No I'm kidding, I don't wanna

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
Look people play casual games and that's okay, it's just you know

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
I was bored

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
If you own an Xbox 360 and the only thing you're playing on it is Bejeweled

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
You are a loser

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Something's wrong, something's wrong

07:50.000 --> 07:56.000
Aside from that I was kicking it semi old school, I was playing Space Channel 5 and Disgaea

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
And the usual WoW

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Are you gonna be in the new Disgaea?

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
When I have the money

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Yeah

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
I mean it's already out but I wanna finish the original Disgaea first

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
I hear, I haven't played the new Disgaea, I've just heard that it's almost just like the first one

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
Like you know it just kind of seamlessly picks up and moves on

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Why change a good thing?

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
And there's still printies in it and apparently

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Goodie

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
There is a cameo of Etna in it

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Cool

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
So

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Looks to be good

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
So anything else besides the WoW and the Bejeweled?

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Like I said Space Channel 5

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Oh hot, I love Space Channel 5

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
Reminds me how much my short term memory sucks

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
I'm sorry what were you talking about?

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
Your gaming week? Alright anyway

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
My gaming week, cause I forgot I haven't talked about mine yet

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
I haven't played anything new, there really wasn't a lot new this week I wanted to buy

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
So it's really most of the same stuff I don't have any new reviews for you guys this week

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
Just because you know people don't really send us stuff

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
And actually can we talk about the one game that we got sent the promo

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Oh yeah okay we can talk about Rule of Rose now

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
So cause we got sent a review for Rule of Rose a while back and I think we can talk about that now

09:03.000 --> 09:10.000
So I played Rule of Rose a few weeks ago and it's being promoted as this Silent Hill-esque kind of game

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
And for the most part that would be an accurate way to describe it

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
If you're into the Silent Hill games you'll probably like Rule of Rose

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
It's like historically based a little bit

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
So it kind of takes place in the 20's and I think it's supposed to be like actually based on this old story

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Are there giant crabs?

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
There are no giant enemy crabs

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
There are screwed up children that mess with your mind

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
In fact this game is somewhat controversial right?

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
Cause there's subtle, very very subtle pedophilia themes in it

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
But not anything crazy

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Very subtle

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Don't take that to mean that it's like in your face

09:39.000 --> 09:44.000
I didn't get to finish the game cause I had to loan my sister my Playstation 2 to use as a DVD player

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
Anyway so she's borrowing that right now

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
So I didn't get to finish it but I did play about three quarters away through the game

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
And yeah from what I understand it is based loosely on

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
I don't want to really

09:58.000 --> 10:06.000
I guess the story that it's kind of based on is actually a real event about some zeppelin that crashed into an orphanage

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Killed lots of people

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
So that gives you an idea of how it might be sort of like a Silent Hill type of game

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
Cause the whole game seems to take place pretty much on this blimp that you're on

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
And it's really creepy and strange

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
It's just unlike Silent Hill it's less

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
But to be fair the blimp is expansive

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
Just like Castlevania always takes place in the castle

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
But it's expansive you know what I mean?

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Exactly it's huge so

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
It's an extra dimensional blimp

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
And you know what I thought of actually

10:35.000 --> 10:40.000
You know how that Castlevania game on DS I said was one of the first games to take the game outside the castle

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
That's not true

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Castlevania II Simon's Quest

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
I completely forgot about it

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
How dare I?

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
I lose five gamer points

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
To be technical you could also go outside the castle in Symphony of the Night

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
Not enough though you know what I mean?

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
Technically you were outside of the castle

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
You were above it as a bat

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
You could also say the very very first stage in Castlevania you're walking up to the castle

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
You could also say that Super Castlevania had the same thing too

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
What the fuck I didn't mean

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
In Castlevania III actually there's a lot of parts that weren't in the castle

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
And in Dracula X

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Look shut your mouth

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
We're supposed to be talking about

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Okay okay let's just play this way

11:16.000 --> 11:23.000
The first Metroidvania where you can legitimately go outside the castle for an extended period of time

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
I like that Metroidvania

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Weren't we talking about Rule of Rose?

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
How did this turn into bashrobsgamercred here somehow?

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
It's always bashrobsgamercred

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Oh no only on message boards sorry

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
It was a pretty fun game I liked it

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
It's very strange and I think it's one of those games that you're not going to understand what's going on until the very end

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
What did you think of having the dog element?

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Because that's where it really differs from Silent Hills

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
You have this partner about 30 minutes to an hour into the game

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
You get this partner that helps you

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
This dog that will seek out items

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
And kind of adds a real interesting element to the puzzle

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
It is an interesting element and to be honest I didn't realize how important it was

12:00.000 --> 12:05.000
You can actually find a lot of hidden weapons and items that way by searching out different things

12:05.000 --> 12:11.000
And you can get some really super powerful weapons if you actually spend the time to use the dog to find different items

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
That seem useless but you trade them in for better stuff

12:14.000 --> 12:22.000
So the dog is pretty cool and it also kind of simplifies things because it makes it simple to find where you're supposed to go

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
You just have the dog sniff out stuff

12:24.000 --> 12:32.000
But the creatures in it are very creepy though all these kind of golem or imp kind of characters

12:32.000 --> 12:39.000
There's children that have like no faces basically and they're just kind of I don't know how to describe them really

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
Just creepy looking

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
So with the dog element we're talking like Silent Hill meets Secret of Evermore?

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
No it's more like Silent Hill meets...

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Oh what was it?

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Haunting Ground

12:52.000 --> 12:58.000
You know the way I'll test if a game is scary or not is I'll make Christopher's sister play it, my roommate

12:58.000 --> 13:04.000
I'll make his sister play it because like seriously this is the girl, and she's not here right now so I can talk a little shit

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
This is the girl who cried while fighting a Silent Hill 3 boss because she couldn't take it

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
Because the boss would run around her and then try to slash her so she started crying

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
Which one was it?

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
I don't remember the name

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Was it Silent Hill 2?

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
No on 3, you find it on the rooftop

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Oh yeah

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Oh I got that

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
Like she cried a lot

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
So if I want to test if a game is scary or not I'll make her play it

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
So I made her play Rule of Rose and she did, she freaked out, she threw the controller on the ground in a few parts

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
She's like I'm not gonna play, I'm not gonna play

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
And then she picks it up again

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
So the scare factor is definitely there if you're a big girl

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
No no no no I got that beat

13:38.000 --> 13:43.000
We were playing Fatal Frame, one of my friends and I, we were playing Fatal Frame

13:43.000 --> 13:51.000
I could not even get her to walk the few feet in the fog because I was freaking out and nothing was happening and I was freaking out

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
I got that beat

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
You know Fatal Frame is the one scary series I could not get into for some reason

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
I don't know why

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
It freaked me out, I don't know why

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
How many of us that are playing the first Resident Evil freaked out when the dogs crashed through the window?

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
I freaked out at the horrible voiceovers

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
I hope that is not Chris's blood

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
Actually my first Resident Evil was 2 for some reason, I kind of missed the boat a little bit

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
But anyway, sorry, Rule of Rose, final thoughts on Rule of Rose

14:16.000 --> 14:22.000
I really like it, it is probably one of the games I've actually played a lot of recently

14:22.000 --> 14:29.000
At least almost all the way through and definitely one that I haven't really played that many games on the Playstation 2 lately

14:29.000 --> 14:35.000
So I recommend picking it up, the only thing that sucks about it is it is full price, it's like $49.99

14:35.000 --> 14:42.000
But if you're really into those kind of niche horror games, it's going to be pretty good for you

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
If you like adventure horror type games, Rule of Rose is going to be right up your alley

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
It's got a great soundtrack too, I forgot to say the soundtrack is phenomenal

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
The soundtrack is awesome, it's actually done by the people who did Panzer Dragoon

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
It's a phenomenal soundtrack, I'm very impressed

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
And what's even cool about the whole thing is once you're done with the game

14:57.000 --> 15:02.000
If you do look up, if you read on message boards and stuff about the backstory to it

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
It's going to be even creepier just the whole thing because it's based on real life

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
Sort of, it's based on real events, how about that

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
The gameplay itself I wouldn't call super original

15:12.000 --> 15:18.000
And it's a weird entry for sort of what's starting to, you know, we're wrapping down this generation of games

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
But overall I would recommend it to fans of the genre

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
And the animation in it is really good too

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
I would recommend it to fans of the genre, I think you guys will be pleased

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
Alright, shall we get into some gaming news tonight then?

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
Oh first, quick housekeeping before we get into gaming news

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
I just wanted to say if you missed the announcement on our website

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
We have relaunched the Dance Dance Revolution sneak peeks

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
And they start tonight and the good news is

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
Even though it was delayed a week, good things come to those who wait

15:44.000 --> 15:49.000
It will be a part of the podcast, you don't have to just listen live to hear the songs

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
So this is amazing, we're really excited to be working with Konami of Hawaii

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
To play some new songs for you, we'll get to that shortly after some news

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
You know what else is amazing?

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
What?

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Well actually what's not amazing?

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
In Karage

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Why?

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
What did he do now?

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
In the news today, he got a new bicycle helmet

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Because he chewed through his strap on his last one

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
And ended up throwing up crayons all over the place

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
Wow, and did he eat paste?

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
I'm sorry, we didn't do Chris's gaming week, I'm so sorry

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Honey, how was your gaming week?

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Oh it was okay, the only reason I wanted

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
I don't know how many Mac fans you guys have on there, probably not a lot

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Actually, you'd be surprised how much hate mail Logan gets

16:28.000 --> 16:33.000
Okay, I have a Mac PowerBook Pro or whatever it's called

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
The latest, whatever the most expensive thing is

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Macbook Pro, whatever the most expensive thing is

16:37.000 --> 16:42.000
And for those of you who like the Sims 2 games on the Mac

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
Go out and get open for business

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
Because in the last few games of the Sims 2

16:49.000 --> 16:53.000
It slows, like the computer just lags it to death

16:53.000 --> 16:58.000
Like anything, any animation, any huge thing that the game does

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
It's lagged and stuff like that

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
And out to lunch, they completely take care of that

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
It's lightning fast

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
Like I got all the animation, I got all the little fun nifty things that happen

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
When your character does something

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
So I just got that and I just played it

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
So that was my fun gaming week

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
That and I played The Da Vinci Code, which sucks

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Why does it suck?

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
I'm not bright

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Is it just your typical bad movie tie-in game?

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Pretty much

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
They want you to do every little knick-knack thing

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
I thought it was going to be cool

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Because it's like, oh, I like stories

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
And they make you do every little thing

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
And I'm not bright

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
So there's really no point to me playing that

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
So you're going to pick up Sims 2 pets when that comes out?

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Hell yeah, I want to kill a dog

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Alright

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
That's an excellent reason

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
I like killing puppies

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Please, no hate mail for the pet lovers

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
No, no, no, no

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
If you kill the pets

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Oh, it's a rumor actually

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
If you kill the pets, they get a little tombstone

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
And they walk around as ghosts

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
It's hilarious

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Every time I hear about dead pets now, I can't help but think about

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Madonna!

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
My precious Madonna!

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Oh my god

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
I cheered when that lady got chewed on

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
Yeah, it's rumored that they did it again

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
And they have the dogs chase the cats

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
It's pretty funny

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Before the hate mail from PETA comes in

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Sorry, so sorry

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
It's because you're not standing on a chair

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
So you're down here on the ground

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
People eating tasty animals

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
I want to hear about people eating tasty paint chips

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Back to a Sony

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
Ken Kuragi is licking wallpaper

18:41.000 --> 18:47.000
But actually, this is proof that he has his head way up his ass

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
Sony has made an official statement saying that they are

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
To quote

18:53.000 --> 18:59.000
The delay in mass production schedule of the blue laser diode within the Sony group

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
Thus affecting the timely procurement of key components to be utilized in PlayStation 3

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
So, in Europe, Russia, Middle East, Africa, and Australia

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
We'll have to wait until March to get a PS3

19:09.000 --> 19:15.000
However, it is on track to launch in Japan on November 11th

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
And in North America on November 17th

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
So basically, by the time you all get it overseas, we're going to tell you how much it sucks already

19:21.000 --> 19:27.000
So essentially, Sony just gave Europe the finger this week, essentially

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Not just Europe, you know

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
That whole chunk of the world

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
Sorry, but yeah, everything on that side of the ocean pretty much got the shaft

19:35.000 --> 19:43.000
Their plan, though, is to still ship 6 million PS3s globally by the end of the 2007 fiscal year

19:43.000 --> 19:48.000
Is this a surprise, though, that this has been delayed? I think a lot of us saw this coming

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
The rumors were out before, you know

19:50.000 --> 19:57.000
Actually, before they made the announcement that there was a shortage with their shipment

19:57.000 --> 20:02.000
Hmm, that's kind of funny, you know, because when you don't, I don't know, start production on a console yet

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
Yeah, it's probably going to be delayed, but

20:05.000 --> 20:10.000
And it's also, you know, not a surprise since the announcement of the delay that they're going to be limited on the quantities

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
That they're going to have for the other two territories that they're actually launching on time

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
And that would be both Japan and North America

20:16.000 --> 20:21.000
What's interesting, though, is that the US is getting 400,000 units at launch

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
And Japan's only getting 100,000

20:23.000 --> 20:30.000
Now, I don't know about you guys, but I figured that Sony, figured that Japan, you know, is pretty rabid Sony fans

20:30.000 --> 20:35.000
And I figured they would give them more units than just 100,000, but I don't know

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Is that because of the population difference or something?

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
I think what it is, I think what it is, maybe, population difference

20:40.000 --> 20:48.000
Also the fact that they have probably a better, they want to have more ground on the US front instead of Japan

20:48.000 --> 20:52.000
Because right now, Japan, the 360 isn't doing very well, so

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Interesting, but, yeah

20:54.000 --> 21:00.000
Is Sony screwed because of this? I mean, seriously guys, I was thinking this week

21:00.000 --> 21:06.000
You know, I'm like, you know, I didn't buy a Playstation 2 until like it was already out for a year

21:06.000 --> 21:13.000
You know, and the Playstation 1 I didn't even blink an eye at until they started getting some of the games I was really interested in on it

21:13.000 --> 21:18.000
So, could the Playstation 3 simply repeat that or maybe we're all giving it a hard time

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Because we're all focused on the launch right now

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
But in a year, could the Playstation 3 maybe be a good console?

21:23.000 --> 21:28.000
To be honest, I mean, what, the 360 launched with almost the same amount of units

21:28.000 --> 21:34.000
So, I don't see that being as big of a deal as the fact that it's $600

21:34.000 --> 21:43.000
And, you know, right now, like they released their first commercial or kind of mini movies that they're going to be advertising it in the UK with

21:43.000 --> 21:54.000
And their big advertisement is, yeah, the AI in games, guess what, it's not just, you know, it's better to spend $600 to buy our games

21:54.000 --> 21:59.000
That's pretty much, you know, their first little thing, it's adaptive, it learns

21:59.000 --> 22:04.000
Oh goody, learning AI, you know, because no other games out there have that

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
Or something

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
Interesting comments from chatroom here, Solarwing is in our chat and says

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Of the 400,000, how many will work?

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
I mean, consoles are notorious at launch time for not working

22:14.000 --> 22:19.000
Go back in the archives, when I got my Xbox 360 in like February

22:19.000 --> 22:23.000
I got a freaking 3 rings of death after 24 hours and I was pissed

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
I think I went off on one show

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
Here's the other thing that you got to think about too that's really interesting

22:27.000 --> 22:32.000
They allocated all their diodes that were being made to the Playstation 3

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Because they were putting all their eggs in one basket

22:34.000 --> 22:41.000
So their standalone Blu-ray player is probably going to be delayed because there's no diodes for it obviously

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
Since they can't even make enough for the Playstation 3

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
What's that going to do for Blu-ray?

22:46.000 --> 22:50.000
That's the big thing, because if they get enough of those HD DVD players out there

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
Then, you know, that might be a problem

22:53.000 --> 22:58.000
But then again, I don't know, I think they use even the same diodes on the HD DVD players

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
Who knows

22:59.000 --> 23:06.000
Comment from Jeremy Todd 1 in chat, with such an extreme shortage I wonder how high prices for the PS3 will get on eBay

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
And here's the other thing too

23:07.000 --> 23:13.000
Remember back in spring when it was supposedly that Playstation 3 was going to launch

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
And, you know, oh yeah we're on track, we're on track

23:16.000 --> 23:21.000
Do we really trust that they're really on track seeing as they haven't even started building these things yet

23:21.000 --> 23:28.000
I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if we get to November and oh, guess what, we're delayed until 2007

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
So, well let's just, it's kind of a wait and see

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
Don't you think, maybe that wouldn't be such a bad thing for them at this point

23:35.000 --> 23:40.000
I mean honestly, should Sony delay the console worldwide until 2007

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
I asked this to everybody on the panel

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
Yes or no and why

23:43.000 --> 23:47.000
No, because they're going to miss out on their Christmas and I think that'd be death for them

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
They need to have their console out there even if it's going to be limited in numbers

23:50.000 --> 23:54.000
Because if anything it'll sell out, people will want it because it's sold out

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
And there you go

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Dark Sakura

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
That's pretty much my assessment on the same thing

24:01.000 --> 24:05.000
I mean, people want what they can't have basically

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
Okay

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Drunami

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Ditto, the shortage is just going to create more demand

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
So, you know, why mess up a good marketing strategy

24:13.000 --> 24:17.000
Even though the commercials are much akin to polishing a turd

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
Okay, Chris, should Sony delay, yes or no

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
No, they at least need to get the Christmas stuff out there

24:23.000 --> 24:27.000
I mean, that whole market and stuff like that, so pretty much what everyone else said

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Okay, I'm going to be brave, I'm going to say yes

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
I think Sony ought to delay at this point

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
Because the games, the lineup games could get stronger for launch

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
Because you've seen all these games getting shuffled around the launch window

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
They would still get the console out by the end of their fiscal year

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
And they could have a stronger launch

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
I think people are going to buy these systems Christmas or not

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
I think the same people are going to buy the system no matter what time of year you launch

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
I realize there's this huge thing to want to get the spoiled kids around Christmas

24:51.000 --> 24:56.000
But those spoiled kids will find an excuse to get their systems in April or March if they want to release them

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
Oh, hold on a sec

24:57.000 --> 25:05.000
What I think is, why would developers be so brave as to dev new games after the launch titles

25:05.000 --> 25:10.000
If the system hasn't been sold yet and the launch titles haven't caught on

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
And so the PS3 hasn't caught on

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
Who's going to be brave enough to dev games for that?

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Alright

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
Interesting thoughts from Chad as well

25:19.000 --> 25:23.000
Jeremy Tom 1 says, the huge problem with this though is that a few people will get a PS3

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
And then their friends will see it and they might decide that the graphics aren't much different from the 360

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
And they'll go buy a 360 instead

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
You know, it's kind of weird

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
And I'm having this weird thing going on

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
The more I haven't been actually seeing some of these games again

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
You know, like Resistance and Lair and stuff like that

25:41.000 --> 25:46.000
I'm actually starting to think, hey you know what, these are actually kind of looking better than the 360

25:46.000 --> 25:52.000
But then again, it makes the games look interesting but I want to see how they play

25:52.000 --> 25:57.000
I don't give a crap if the graphics are slightly higher resolution than this

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
That does not make the console any better than its predecessor

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
Or its competition for that matter

26:03.000 --> 26:08.000
It's just why some DS games are simpler looking but they're more fun to play

26:08.000 --> 26:16.000
I don't know, they're really trying to say better graphics equal better games and that's just not the case

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
The system is only as good as the games that are on it

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
True, and Psycoon has an interesting follow up to that

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
Psycoon says, I will get a PS3 on the day Kingdom Hearts 3 comes out

26:26.000 --> 26:30.000
So is it just going to take, and even Chris agrees with that comment

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
Is it just going to take that game to sell the system?

26:33.000 --> 26:40.000
You know what, I'm sorry, I don't have a lot of money to drop on a game system

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
If there's not going to be a game that I want

26:44.000 --> 26:51.000
I'm a very big Disney fan so I bought a PS2 for the sole purpose of playing Kingdom Hearts

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
And I've discovered other games that I like about it

26:53.000 --> 26:58.000
But unless they make a game that I want, I'm not going to drop that much money on it

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
The Wii does look interesting though

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
Megzy's in chat and says there's no reason to get a PS3 at launch

27:03.000 --> 27:07.000
The only exclusive games worth getting will be out in 2007-2008

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Metal Gear Solid 4, Final Fantasy 13 and so on

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
That's kind of how I felt about the Playstation 2

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
To be honest, what was I going to buy at launch, Fantavision?

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
There is some good games, there are some

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
Fantavision was sort of fun

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
Was it Lair, is it Miklotov or Jamie in here? I'm not sure

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
It was sort of fun

27:22.000 --> 27:30.000
I would say there are some good exclusive games, Lair and Resistance Fall of Man look pretty good

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
But then again, I haven't seen them

27:33.000 --> 27:38.000
I think after Tokyo Game Show we'll get a better gauge of how good the games are going to be

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
And they're going to have to start marketing this thing pretty soon

27:41.000 --> 27:49.000
Because convincing someone why they need to buy a $600 console is going to be pretty difficult

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
So, we'll have to wait and see

27:52.000 --> 27:56.000
Alright, well moving on, one thing that will be available around the PS3 launch

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
If you can't afford a Playstation 3, which most of us can't

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
And by the way, you know what Europe, I'll do you a favor

28:02.000 --> 28:07.000
I am not going to buy a Playstation 3 until you guys are able to buy a Playstation 3

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
Which is easy because I wasn't going to get one anyway

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
But we can call this a protest now, it makes it really easy

28:13.000 --> 28:18.000
Honestly Europe, I don't think you guys are missing much

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
I mean that's kind of how I feel, I don't want one of these at launch

28:21.000 --> 28:26.000
I guess maybe I feel bad for the person who really really does in Europe that can't have one now

28:26.000 --> 28:31.000
Well, you know what, couldn't they just import?

28:31.000 --> 28:37.000
Because the games are supposed to be region free

28:37.000 --> 28:42.000
We haven't really had super final confirmation on that though, that could have changed

28:42.000 --> 28:50.000
However, unless Sony is just going to say give a big F you to format

28:50.000 --> 28:55.000
Because you still have the difference between NTSC and PAL

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
Oh, that's a good point

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
Unless they are just going to say screw all you, it's high definition or NTSC only

29:01.000 --> 29:08.000
But I don't think that's right, that would really put aside a large market of business

29:08.000 --> 29:14.000
I meant to say that something that will be available when the Playstation 3 launches in November

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
Is the PSP download service

29:18.000 --> 29:23.000
Original Playstation games will be downloadable and the PSP has no problem running them via an emulator

29:23.000 --> 29:28.000
This is all coming from Sony's head of platform development in Japan, Izumi Kawanishi

29:28.000 --> 29:35.000
Kawanishi is also saying that the PSP download service will have movies as well as full original Playstation games

29:35.000 --> 29:39.000
And it will launch at the same time as the Playstation 3

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
And that's about it, that's all they said

29:41.000 --> 29:47.000
Well, you can't download retail movies yet, you can get like vodcasts and things using little hacks

29:47.000 --> 29:52.000
But Sony has yet to really support full blown movies

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
And obviously they are going to be releasing the digital rights management and all this stuff

29:55.000 --> 29:59.000
And I guess trying to salvage some of what they have lost on UMD, I don't know

29:59.000 --> 30:05.000
Well, I think they were rumored to be trying to relaunch UMD at a lower price point or something like that

30:05.000 --> 30:12.000
I remember seeing an article on some site that talked about how they really, really sliced the cost of UMDs in Japan

30:12.000 --> 30:18.000
To about 8 bucks a disk, our price, and they are on fire, they are selling like crazy

30:18.000 --> 30:24.000
So that's the secret Sony, just put out the UMDs and sell them a little cheaper than what you are doing

30:24.000 --> 30:29.000
Make them cheaper than DVDs, and I think they will be a lot more appealing to a lot of people very quick

30:29.000 --> 30:34.000
And you will sell PSPs, but what do I know, I'm just some schmo on the internet

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
Exactly, well I didn't want to say exactly

30:37.000 --> 30:44.000
But anyways, some other things that are possibly in the works right now would be a Sony Playstation phone

30:44.000 --> 30:54.000
And I kind of, when I saw this I was thinking, oh god, please not another N-Gage, because that's just horrible

30:54.000 --> 31:04.000
But apparently, according to Sony Ericsson's Senior Vice President of Product and Application Planning, Rico Sakaguchi

31:04.000 --> 31:09.000
The company is working on something related to the Playstation phone

31:09.000 --> 31:17.000
And it says the surprise must be kept for the future, so maybe something that will be announced at the Tokyo Game Show

31:17.000 --> 31:23.000
I don't know, it sounds interesting, I'm not sure, maybe something to do with the download service

31:23.000 --> 31:27.000
And they are going to do something with the phones, you can download Playstation 1 games or something

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Voice over IP

31:29.000 --> 31:34.000
That would be a huge perk, I think, to voice over IP

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
The phone station

31:37.000 --> 31:41.000
I think what I like about the PSP a lot is that it really is kind of this all in one system

31:41.000 --> 31:47.000
It kind of is the leg up that it has on the DS, it seems like the DS, well it has a lot of solid games that are innovative

31:47.000 --> 31:54.000
It's kind of having to catch up in the department of having a web browser, playing MP3s and all this other stuff that a PSP does

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
You know what I mean?

31:55.000 --> 32:02.000
But wouldn't you rather have a system that you know is going to play a good game, that you know they put effort into

32:02.000 --> 32:07.000
Well, what if I'm more of the casual gamer, who maybe that's not my biggest focus on the system

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
DS sales are still kicking PSP

32:10.000 --> 32:16.000
Yeah, but don't get me wrong, it's interesting all these things that kind of distinguish the PSP a little bit

32:16.000 --> 32:23.000
I think they're all cool, but the market is showing people aren't interested in all that as much as they are in just having good games

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Okay

32:25.000 --> 32:33.000
Well, speaking of good games, there is something coming on to PSP that I will definitely be all over

32:33.000 --> 32:38.000
Parappa the Rapper is coming on to PSP

32:38.000 --> 32:42.000
In the rain or in the snow?

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Got the funky, funky flow

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Crack butter!

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
No, don't even get me started on too many levels

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
Check and turn and signal to the left, sorry, love Parappa, love it

32:53.000 --> 33:02.000
There's not really an official announcement yet, but the game was recently featured in Famitsu

33:02.000 --> 33:07.000
So the talk is that we are pretty much going to be getting a Parappa

33:07.000 --> 33:11.000
And actually that makes sense because they did Guitar Man

33:11.000 --> 33:17.000
And they're starting to put out a bit more music and slash quirky games on the PSP

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
So my hope is that this does come to pass

33:19.000 --> 33:24.000
And so this isn't just a port of the PS1 thing on the download service, this is like a whole new frickin' thing

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
That's the rumor

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
Wow, that would be hot, because Parappa kind of disappeared for a while

33:29.000 --> 33:33.000
Granted, Parappa the Rapper 2 wasn't quite as good as one, at least commercially

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
We need to own Jameralami

33:34.000 --> 33:37.000
Yeah, I know, we need to bring the series back, that would be awesome

33:37.000 --> 33:42.000
Well, Parappa is not the only thing rumored to be coming back for the PSP

33:42.000 --> 33:47.000
Electronic Arts has confirmed that they are doing an EA Replay collection

33:47.000 --> 33:51.000
And this will be a budget series of adventures for those folks that would be interested in this

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
Get this, the types of games that are going to be in the EA Replay

33:54.000 --> 34:00.000
Syndicate, Ultima 7 The Black Gate, Road Rash 1-3, Wing Commander

34:00.000 --> 34:07.000
And some other interesting titles such as Desert Strike, Jungle Strike, Virtual Pinball, Mutant League Football

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
That would be very interesting

34:09.000 --> 34:13.000
But they haven't said anything about that they're going to upgrade the graphics

34:13.000 --> 34:18.000
These may just be straight up ports, but still there's something oddly appealing about being able to play Wing Commander

34:18.000 --> 34:22.000
I think they were supposed to be ports of the Super Nintendo and Genesis versions

34:22.000 --> 34:26.000
Oh, that would be a crap, if it's just a port of the Genesis, oh forget it

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
It's all about the PC one, but Ultima 7 wasn't on PC

34:29.000 --> 34:34.000
I mean, whoops, Ultima 7 was only on PC, wasn't it?

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
They ported 6 to Super Nintendo, they didn't do 7

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
Yeah, they ported 6, they didn't port 7

34:38.000 --> 34:42.000
Yeah, they didn't port 7, so there must be some PC things involved

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
Who knows?

34:43.000 --> 34:48.000
Anyways, it's kind of interesting though that at least that is coming out

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
One game that is not coming out on time, Armored Core 4

34:51.000 --> 34:56.000
It's missing the Playstation 3 launch and it's rumored to have been canceled for the 360

34:56.000 --> 35:02.000
Which is very disappointing because I love me my Armored Core a bit more than ChromeHounds, that's for sure

35:02.000 --> 35:06.000
But anyways, yeah, the From Software game

35:06.000 --> 35:10.000
You know, I just have a really hard time believing that it's canceled on 360

35:10.000 --> 35:15.000
Seeing as, you know, they've already kind of worked on, you know, ChromeHounds

35:15.000 --> 35:20.000
But anyways, it's supposed to be coming out in spring of next year

35:20.000 --> 35:28.000
So, you know, yet another reason why waiting to march maybe isn't such a bad idea for the Playstation 3

35:28.000 --> 35:32.000
Well, in regards to other games and the Playstation 3

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
Enchanted Arms is actually going to be out on the Playstation 3

35:35.000 --> 35:43.000
I don't know how I feel about that, I mean, I picked up Enchanted Arms, I haven't played it yet

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
I think you're going to enjoy it, I think you'll enjoy it

35:45.000 --> 35:50.000
You know, it took me a while to get into the game, but it's really good

35:50.000 --> 35:58.000
I mean, it's not the best RPG I've ever played, but it's a very good first next-gen experience for RPGs

35:58.000 --> 36:02.000
I was just thinking it was good to have such a solid, you know, apparently a solid game

36:02.000 --> 36:08.000
On the 360 and just that it's coming out on the Playstation 3, just sort of like, no

36:08.000 --> 36:12.000
It seems like it's a little late, you know, by the time it comes out for the Playstation 3

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
It'll be like, oh well, next-gen RPGs are going to be old news

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
I guess it depends when it comes out, I mean, if Enchanted Arms is coming out at launch

36:18.000 --> 36:22.000
Well, that might not be a bad thing, that could be pretty good for Sony

36:22.000 --> 36:26.000
But it doesn't seem like it would be out in time for launch if it's just now being announced

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
I don't know

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
Nah, probably not

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
I mean, they already have Oblivion coming out, so that's pretty good

36:31.000 --> 36:35.000
That's true, maybe if they could redo all the voiceovers then it wouldn't be so bad

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
I don't think they would

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
I don't think they would

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
It would be just a port

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
I don't think they would either

36:40.000 --> 36:44.000
Well, one other thing you're going to be missing out on on the Playstation 3

36:44.000 --> 36:51.000
Rumors now is that 1080p is actually not really going to be used in games as much as you think

36:51.000 --> 37:00.000
According to Sony, the official US Playstation 3 site says that the HDMI connection is required for 1080p signals in Blu-ray movies

37:00.000 --> 37:07.000
Sony has made an issue of pointing out that 1080p, which the Xbox 360 is incapable of, is the holy grail of full HD

37:07.000 --> 37:11.000
The only game that's running in 1080p, though, is Gran Turismo HD

37:11.000 --> 37:15.000
This was just a tech demo that was created, not really a full game that's running yet

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
Well, actually, it is going to be a full game, unfortunately

37:18.000 --> 37:27.000
Well, but it should be said also that even with final hardware in mind, reaching a good frame rate at 1080p with next-gen graphics is almost impossible

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
Most folks are just aiming for 720p

37:30.000 --> 37:38.000
So it sounds like, okay, your movies will be at 1080p, which will be nice, but your games, not a lot are going to be at 1080p

37:38.000 --> 37:42.000
Now, to Sony's benefit, or to Sony's credit, though, here

37:42.000 --> 37:50.000
Maybe this is something that would be more at the Playstation 3's end of cycle, that you'd start seeing more 1080p games

37:50.000 --> 37:54.000
Like how on Xbox, the first Xbox, before the 360

37:54.000 --> 37:58.000
You started seeing, in the end, some games start to come out in high def towards the end

37:58.000 --> 38:02.000
And then widescreen, especially, you started seeing a lot more widescreen games on Xbox

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
And then you started to see, like, burnout, wasn't one of the burnouts towards the end in 720p?

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
Yeah, I think so

38:06.000 --> 38:10.000
So maybe 1080p is just something that will be more utilized later down the road

38:10.000 --> 38:18.000
But wait, are you guys seeing that Sony was lying when they said that they can do 1080p at 120 frames per second?

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
Well, in one game

38:19.000 --> 38:25.000
Fucking retarded, I don't know why we trust them with any comments anymore

38:25.000 --> 38:30.000
But, whatever, so, okay, so your games are not going to be 1080p

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
You know, 1080i is pretty good anyways

38:33.000 --> 38:38.000
Although, one thing that's kind of being debated right now is load times

38:38.000 --> 38:43.000
And as anyone remembers on the Playstation stuff, the load times can be quite long

38:43.000 --> 38:48.000
And they're actually saying that because of the blu-ray drive being a first generation drive

38:48.000 --> 38:56.000
It is going to be slower than the actual DVD drive in the Xbox 360

38:56.000 --> 39:02.000
Now, the blu-ray drive is actually going to be a 1.5 speed drive

39:02.000 --> 39:06.000
And transfers at about 54 megabits a second

39:06.000 --> 39:14.000
And they said that their Playstation 3 is actually a 2-speed blu-ray drive

39:14.000 --> 39:18.000
Which is actually 72 megabits per second or 9 megabytes per second

39:18.000 --> 39:24.000
Now, the 360 is a 12-speed DVD drive which gives you 16 megabytes per second

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
So that is a bit faster

39:26.000 --> 39:33.000
Now, the thing that, when I was reading this, is since all the Playstation 3s are going to have a hard drive in them though

39:33.000 --> 39:37.000
The developers are going to be able to develop, you know, with a hard drive in mind

39:37.000 --> 39:41.000
So you're going to be able to cache a lot of stuff to your hard drive, I would think

39:41.000 --> 39:47.000
Because whereas, you know, the one big thing with the 360, I remember, because of the core and premium bundles

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
Is they weren't sure if the hard drive was going to be there

39:50.000 --> 39:55.000
And so they couldn't really, you know, take that into account and cache the information to it

39:55.000 --> 39:59.000
But I guess now more of the games are using the hard drive

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
But that might be something that might speed it up

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
And, whatever, it's load times

40:04.000 --> 40:08.000
If you want your 1080p games at 120 frames per second, you're going to have to wait

40:08.000 --> 40:11.000
Well, yeah, I think you said it with load times

40:11.000 --> 40:14.000
I mean, I don't care what the speed is of the thing inside the system

40:14.000 --> 40:19.000
It's all about, you know, the load time and how good the system is at, you know, caching and all that stuff

40:19.000 --> 40:24.000
Though, you know, I get it, logic dictates that you have a slow drive in the thing, you're going to have longer load times

40:24.000 --> 40:28.000
I get it, but if there's some other way Sony can get around that and the developers

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Then I don't think it will be the end of the world

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
Yeah, exactly

40:31.000 --> 40:38.000
Alright, well let's go over to a realm that we don't get into often enough here on this program, that's PC gaming

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
And we have a few PC gaming stories for you guys tonight

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
And I want to start off with something on Second Life

40:42.000 --> 40:46.000
Which is this thing I keep hearing about, but honestly I've never really had a chance to get into and play

40:46.000 --> 40:51.000
Drew Nami, you play Second Life, tell me a little bit about what Second Life is all about

40:51.000 --> 40:55.000
It's kind of like a virtual community, if you've ever played

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
Actually, it is a virtual community

40:56.000 --> 41:01.000
If you've ever played like, say, Sims Online or There or anything like that

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
It's this virtual world, you have your avatar, you can customize the avatar

41:05.000 --> 41:10.000
It's got a lot of communities in there, it's fairly technical if you want to code your own stuff

41:10.000 --> 41:14.000
Okay, I get that, it's a virtual world, why should I get into Second Life?

41:14.000 --> 41:19.000
Basically anything you can't do in real life, you can do in Second Life

41:19.000 --> 41:24.000
You can build stuff all on your own, have your own zone's own virtual land in there

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
I can be a stripper

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
Have sex in different rooms

41:27.000 --> 41:31.000
I can't, as Chris said, wait you gotta say that Chris

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
Have sex in weird positions

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
Yeah, things that may not be physically possible in real life

41:36.000 --> 41:42.000
Number one, it is possible, number two, unfortunately I've seen it done

41:42.000 --> 41:47.000
Or in the case of this picture I'm looking at here, I'm not sure if this is from Second Life or what

41:47.000 --> 41:51.000
But it looks like you have furries banding together there in Second Life

41:51.000 --> 41:55.000
There's actually a pretty active furry community within Second Life

41:55.000 --> 42:02.000
Okay, whatever you're into, don't touch me with your paws

42:02.000 --> 42:09.000
But anyway, the reason why I bring this up, I got in the news this week that hackers broke into Second Life on Thursday

42:09.000 --> 42:14.000
And it was noted on the blog of the parent company to Second Life, Linden Labs

42:14.000 --> 42:23.000
The intruders got access to the account names, real life names, contact information, encrypted account passwords and encrypted payment information

42:23.000 --> 42:33.000
Now, these types of violations of security sadly aren't that uncommon when you think about it happens in the Amazon type market

42:33.000 --> 42:37.000
I'm not saying that site specifically, but those type of markets online all the time

42:37.000 --> 42:44.000
But this is really the first, or at least one of the most notable cases where it's happening in a video game

42:44.000 --> 42:50.000
Or it's happening in a place where people spend a lot of time as opposed to check in, check out

42:50.000 --> 42:59.000
So the possibility that folks are going to feel more violated over it is I think a lot higher in my opinion

42:59.000 --> 43:03.000
I mean we still get pissed off in MMOs over gold sellers

43:03.000 --> 43:09.000
True, so what do you think about this? Being a Second Life player, what do you think about the fact that your information may have been compromised?

43:09.000 --> 43:15.000
Well, for me personally, I don't put anything up on there that I wouldn't be embarrassed to have public

43:15.000 --> 43:22.000
But the net result what pissed me off is I had to reset my damn password, they invalidated everyone's passwords

43:22.000 --> 43:27.000
Oh interesting, well at least they were pretty quick to get in there and try to fix things, that's good

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
Yeah, I think they got it done in like a matter of hours

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
Alright, well, pretty quick on Linden Labs

43:33.000 --> 43:37.000
Good for them for being right on it and you know, remedying the situation

43:37.000 --> 43:43.000
Well, guess what is not being remedied

43:43.000 --> 43:44.000
What's that?

43:44.000 --> 43:49.000
Well not really, but you know, you remember how everyone was all like, yeah Spore's gonna be all over the place, right?

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
Right, like DS and PSP and all that stuff?

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
No

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
No? Like no console versions at all?

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
It's PC only for now

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
Oh, okay

44:01.000 --> 44:05.000
Basically, and this is the quote from EA

44:05.000 --> 44:10.000
Although we're investigating the possibilities of bringing this franchise to other platforms in the future

44:10.000 --> 44:15.000
Any announcements or confirmations for the Wii or any other platform would be premature

44:15.000 --> 44:19.000
Oh, this might be because I think I remember reading another story earlier this week about how

44:19.000 --> 44:23.000
I think they were saying something about Spore on the Wii was gonna be able to download to the DS

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
And you could edit your creatures on the go

44:25.000 --> 44:31.000
Well, they're saying right now they're 100% focused on finishing Spore for PC and PC only

44:31.000 --> 44:32.000
Okay

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
As that's the official word

44:34.000 --> 44:37.000
That makes sense, but we all know it's gonna go like The Sims

44:37.000 --> 44:42.000
Where The Sims was on PC first and then you had 5 gazillion different versions on all the consoles just later on

44:42.000 --> 44:43.000
It'll spread

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
Yeah

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
But for now, I think it's actually good that they are focusing only on PC

44:47.000 --> 44:53.000
That way they can bring out a quality product to get the buzz going and then from their work on the other versions

44:53.000 --> 44:58.000
Now, OLarmyEddie in our chat room says EA lies, lies

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
They all lie

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
Interesting

45:00.000 --> 45:05.000
By the way, also following up on the Second Life information, Tigerclaw in our chat says

45:05.000 --> 45:10.000
Also note that the credit card information was on another server and that wasn't compromised

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
Okay

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
That's good

45:12.000 --> 45:17.000
Anyways, if you're really into Sims stuff, you might be interested in this

45:17.000 --> 45:20.000
No, this doesn't have to do with The Sims

45:20.000 --> 45:24.000
Some other gaming series, Sid Meier's is actually being

45:24.000 --> 45:29.000
They're releasing a wonderful collection, which is going to be coming to the stores pretty soon here

45:29.000 --> 45:40.000
It will be including quite a few different games, including Civilization I, Civ II, Civ II Fantastic Worlds, Civ II Conflicts in Civilization

45:40.000 --> 45:49.000
Civ II Tests of Time, Civ III, Civ III Play the World, and Civ III Conquest, and finally Civ IV

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
So a whole bunch of Civilization for you

45:51.000 --> 45:55.000
But to be honest, if you're a Civilization fan, you probably have all that shit already

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
I mean, is there anything special that doesn't, you know

45:58.000 --> 46:04.000
Well, you get a Civilization card game, a 96-page book of artwork

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
Ooh, artwork

46:05.000 --> 46:14.000
And a DVD featuring lead designer Soren Johnson and artist Dorian Newcomb and talking about the creation of Civ IV

46:14.000 --> 46:19.000
Now, I really can't bash this too much because I've said it on this show before, Civilization, the original

46:19.000 --> 46:24.000
The first one that ever came out on the PC is hands down my favorite PC game ever, ever

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
I love the original Civilization

46:26.000 --> 46:30.000
Don't ask me, I can't get into Civ II, III the same

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
I haven't tried IV yet, I really want to

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
I can't get into II and III the same way I can the original

46:34.000 --> 46:38.000
What were you doing this for? Are you saying I'm too stupid to get II and III?

46:38.000 --> 46:42.000
No, I'm saying the entirety of Civ goes right over my head

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Seriously, I don't know if...

46:44.000 --> 46:47.000
There's got to be a way you can get Civilization I really cheap now

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
I highly urge you guys to check it out

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
Civ II is not bad either, really, I mean, it's not bad

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
I just didn't enjoy it as much as I

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
So, seriously, check these games out

46:55.000 --> 46:58.000
It's a great, great landmark game in PC history

46:58.000 --> 46:59.000
I absolutely love Civ I

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
I used to play Civ Net back in the day

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
But, you know, I have to admit

47:03.000 --> 47:06.000
Actually, something like this, to me, who hasn't followed the Civ series for a long time

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
This almost sounds appealing

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
But I don't know, I don't know if I have that much time

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Civilization is one of those things

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
When I was playing Civilization on the PC, I literally was not playing anything else, ever

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
So, I don't know

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
Nerd

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
Yeah, I am, a little bit

47:19.000 --> 47:23.000
Speaking of nerds, many of you out there on the internet like to email us every week

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
And we're here to read your emails on air

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Don't roll your eyes at me, Dark Sakura

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
I wasn't rolling my eyes

47:30.000 --> 47:36.000
And the queen nerd, Dark Sakura, is here to read those emails for you every week

47:36.000 --> 47:41.000
I'm the queen nerd, you're the king dork

47:41.000 --> 47:44.000
So, suit up the rubber gloves in this besto suit

47:44.000 --> 47:47.000
And tell us who's emailed us at Mailbag at OrangeOnTrader.com this week

47:47.000 --> 47:51.000
I do want to go ahead and actually repeat the ages-old disclaimer

47:51.000 --> 47:54.000
If you send us hate mail, all we're going to do is laugh at you

47:54.000 --> 47:57.000
Yeah, so we had a couple ha-has this week, which was great

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
Thank you for the hate mail

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
It was the most ridiculous thing I've ever read

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
Anyway, so back

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Actually, we need more, because I didn't laugh enough this week

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
So please send us more hate mail, actually

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
And hate mail means you were listening

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
So thank you for downloading our podcast

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
Seriously

48:11.000 --> 48:14.000
You know what's funny about that hate mail that I read?

48:14.000 --> 48:17.000
It's obvious that the people were listening to the show regularly

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
So hey, cool, new listener

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
I didn't see the one that was towards you

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Doesn't matter

48:23.000 --> 48:28.000
Anyway, we got one that is not crap

48:28.000 --> 48:31.000
From Renee

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
I guess it's Renee? Yeah

48:33.000 --> 48:37.000
Hello Jamie Skye and Loki, but mostly Jamie as you're the only one who mostly reads these emails

48:37.000 --> 48:42.000
I was looking through the PEGI, Pan-European Game Information website

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
Which is a video game rating board

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
Reported that video games are actually good for you

48:47.000 --> 48:50.000
Here is a link, it's an old article, July 12th, 2006

48:50.000 --> 48:53.000
But at least we know that Europe loves video games

48:53.000 --> 48:59.000
It's sort of a long URL, but I'll just go over some highlights

48:59.000 --> 49:06.000
It was about a meeting that was in Brussels on July 6th, 2006

49:06.000 --> 49:10.000
That had the consumers, publishers, developers of video games

49:10.000 --> 49:13.000
In the European Union involved in this

49:13.000 --> 49:16.000
They were including parent representatives

49:16.000 --> 49:19.000
Panels of expert psychologists, media specialists

49:19.000 --> 49:24.000
Who were just discussing the whole thing from what I was reading in this article

49:24.000 --> 49:30.000
And there's actually a quote on here that I liked

49:30.000 --> 49:34.000
In light of such a thorough analysis of current issues and such a lively dialogue

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
We should not let this intellectual stimulation die out

49:37.000 --> 49:42.000
ISFE will see to building upon this exchange and make it happen on a permanent and regular basis

49:42.000 --> 49:45.000
But as they were going through they were saying

49:45.000 --> 49:49.000
They were just reviewing the different perceptions based on all sides of the issue

49:49.000 --> 49:56.000
And that it was coming through that basically that games have innovative effects

49:56.000 --> 50:01.000
You can use them for education, treatment of behavior problems, attention deficit disorder

50:01.000 --> 50:04.000
They're even going into manned space exploration

50:04.000 --> 50:08.000
There's all kinds of different applications that video games themselves apply to

50:08.000 --> 50:14.000
If our army is using them then there's got to be something there

50:14.000 --> 50:27.000
Where the hell was that kind of information when my parents wouldn't let me get a game system when I was in high school?

50:27.000 --> 50:30.000
I'm posting in the chatroom right now

50:30.000 --> 50:33.000
Video games do not rot your brain

50:33.000 --> 50:39.000
The television does and then the aliens suck your face off just like in that episode of Doctor Who

50:39.000 --> 50:45.000
I play video games on the television

50:45.000 --> 50:48.000
Moving on

50:48.000 --> 50:53.000
Wow this is a long one too

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
I guess I'm going to go over this I'm not sure

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
Wow this is a very long email

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
Sorry

51:00.000 --> 51:06.000
I'm just going to say this is from Kenji

51:06.000 --> 51:09.000
Congratulations on your upcoming 200 episodes

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
I've been watching OLR since the late 80 episodes

51:12.000 --> 51:15.000
And while I've been unable to watch you guys on a consistent basis

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
That's amazing seeing we're a radio program

51:17.000 --> 51:23.000
I applaud your perseverance against the Mackinac dominant big wig video game journalist

51:23.000 --> 51:29.000
I have a feeling this is going to be a long email please brace yourselves

51:29.000 --> 51:32.000
I went into the email box and actually read the email

51:32.000 --> 51:37.000
Was this the one that was about the really in depth analysis about Sony?

51:37.000 --> 51:41.000
I think I could be crossing my wires here

51:41.000 --> 51:46.000
E3 and Mardi Gras

51:46.000 --> 51:50.000
Oh yeah there's a Sony Microsoft deal gameplay

51:50.000 --> 51:53.000
It's fairly long there's a lot of good bits in this

51:53.000 --> 51:58.000
I read over it in the time that I had available to me

51:58.000 --> 52:01.000
Maybe we should post it in the forums

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
I'm going to

52:03.000 --> 52:11.000
Pick one paragraph from the letter to read so at least we have something to respond to here

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
It's long okay

52:13.000 --> 52:16.000
No it's okay I'll go with the gameplay

52:16.000 --> 52:23.000
Since the handheld love the adoration for everyone's favorite innocently yet so vulgarly named Wii

52:23.000 --> 52:28.000
Games with the ability to simply pick up and play and of all things retro gaming

52:28.000 --> 52:31.000
CD and television lives

52:31.000 --> 52:37.000
Sorry I guess television lives console and target the mock up 2600s that are announced

52:37.000 --> 52:42.000
That now store pretty much every good Atari game within its tape deck like cabinet

52:42.000 --> 52:46.000
The TV games that were on everyone's Christmas wish list a year ago or so

52:46.000 --> 52:52.000
Because there is a growing community that realizes that maybe the forefathers of video gaming had something going

52:52.000 --> 52:59.000
On graphically sucked balls great description but it still has the staying power due to its at the time imaginative gameplay

52:59.000 --> 53:04.000
Super Mario Brothers was beautiful in the fact that it only took at most two lives for even the most dimwitted of people

53:04.000 --> 53:07.000
To get the hang of what you had to do and the list goes on and on

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
I'm going to keep going a little bit

53:09.000 --> 53:12.000
In fact what do the majority of people who game on their PS

53:12.000 --> 53:18.000
PS use NES SNES Neo Geo and Genesis emulators nonetheless

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
That's a good point

53:20.000 --> 53:30.000
Gunpei who let's see Mr. Yokoi's magnum opus for the Wonderswan is now being remade for the current generations

53:30.000 --> 53:35.000
And touch generations are catering to a whole new type of game

53:35.000 --> 53:41.000
Our Xbox Live Arcade is an ingenious Microsoft strategy that I applaud even if I do load their very being

53:41.000 --> 53:48.000
Yeah it's a really long email and actually if you don't mind I would like to actually put this letter up on our forums

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Alright

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
So if you're listening which we hope if you're listening to the podcast right now

53:53.000 --> 53:57.000
Just shoot me an email at jamieatorangegeldradio.com and let me know if you're fine with that

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
Sweet

53:58.000 --> 54:02.000
You know just to respond to that about the retro gaming I think the person's got a good point there

54:02.000 --> 54:05.000
I love Xbox Live Arcade as well that practically sold the system for me

54:05.000 --> 54:10.000
Because the launch titles didn't you know rock my world but I knew that arcade was like this great thing

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
And there were a couple launch titles I wanted

54:12.000 --> 54:22.000
But I think even if a game is old and has basic graphics doesn't mean it's going to be a bad game

54:22.000 --> 54:25.000
And I think people do have a lot of respect for the retro graphics

54:25.000 --> 54:32.000
And you know of course a little game called Geometry Wars I think woke everybody up to that fact really in this next gen battle

54:32.000 --> 54:38.000
So I think you are going to see the retro factor really start to kind of crank up a little bit in this next gen

54:38.000 --> 54:46.000
There's actually a very good comparison to one of Tezuka's comics

54:46.000 --> 54:51.000
And I guess the current industry I really want to put this up on the site

54:51.000 --> 54:54.000
It's very long and I'm not going to do it just reading it over the air

54:54.000 --> 54:58.000
So I'd really like permission to post it up on the site just let me know please

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
Alright any more emails?

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
Oh yeah

55:00.000 --> 55:01.000
Alright

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
No I have no more email

55:03.000 --> 55:08.000
One week you weren't here I went into the mail bag and there was like nothing there

55:08.000 --> 55:11.000
They knew Jamie was gone so I was like ok no need to email

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
Hey watch that ego

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
Hey my email is great

55:14.000 --> 55:22.000
Ok this is from I guess Stickaxe I don't have a signature on here so I'm just going to go

55:22.000 --> 55:23.000
Oh Eric sorry

55:23.000 --> 55:27.000
You guys are absolutely the greatest audio only entertainment out there no questions asked

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
My name is Eric and I write to you from Indiana

55:29.000 --> 55:35.000
Loki you are amazing, awesome, superior, great, mighty, sweet, strong, marvelous, almighty, godlike, admirable, excellent

55:35.000 --> 55:38.000
Satisfying, pleasing, respectable, gnarly, stupendous, and honorable

55:38.000 --> 55:39.000
Who is that?

55:39.000 --> 55:43.000
What?

55:43.000 --> 55:44.000
No I

55:44.000 --> 55:45.000
Who was that?

55:45.000 --> 55:46.000
That they were talking about?

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
I missed

55:47.000 --> 55:48.000
They were talking about Loki

55:48.000 --> 55:49.000
Oh ok

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
Apparently

55:50.000 --> 55:51.000
Oh is this the one that

55:51.000 --> 55:52.000
Yeah that was the one I mentioned

55:52.000 --> 55:53.000
Oh that's not hardly you

55:53.000 --> 55:54.000
No I know it's funny

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Ok so Jamie you are just absolutely amazing

55:56.000 --> 55:57.000
Oh thank you

55:57.000 --> 56:03.000
This guy I'm sorry man but you honestly have to try and shut up for more than 10 seconds at a time

56:03.000 --> 56:06.000
As he drinks his ginger beer

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
Not talking

56:08.000 --> 56:12.000
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
Nope sorry can't talk listeners don't like me talking

56:14.000 --> 56:15.000
Rob

56:15.000 --> 56:16.000
I talk too damn much

56:16.000 --> 56:17.000
I like you talking

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
I like you talking

56:19.000 --> 56:22.000
Nope I make this show too gay I can't talk anymore

56:22.000 --> 56:27.000
This Rob is, this Rob, our show is

56:27.000 --> 56:31.000
This Rob is gay, this Rob is very gay

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
What is wrong with this Rob?

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
He's so gay he gays up Orange Line Radio

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
Rob is our facilitator

56:37.000 --> 56:38.000
Rob is our facilitator

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Look maybe I do talk too much it's fine

56:40.000 --> 56:41.000
You know what it's just

56:41.000 --> 56:44.000
Keep in mind kids what I do for a living

56:44.000 --> 56:47.000
I talk all day to people and they are paid to listen to me

56:47.000 --> 56:48.000
I'm a trainer basically

56:48.000 --> 56:51.000
So you know I just I can't shut up it's my nature I'm sorry

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
Mhmm

56:52.000 --> 56:53.000
Hugs and kisses

56:53.000 --> 56:57.000
With all of that out of the way I was seriously wondering something

56:57.000 --> 57:00.000
You probably, by the way the one I got was crap

57:00.000 --> 57:01.000
But okay

57:01.000 --> 57:04.000
But um probably mentioned it on one of your earlier shows so I apologize

57:04.000 --> 57:08.000
I'm a big fanboy of the show Stargate SG-1 Oh I Love You

57:08.000 --> 57:13.000
And last year I heard there was going to be a Stargate SG-1 video game coming out later that year

57:13.000 --> 57:16.000
I was really excited about it at first and sort of forgot about it as time went on

57:16.000 --> 57:19.000
It's now late 2006 and I haven't heard anything about it

57:19.000 --> 57:20.000
Was it cancelled or was it out?

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
Or am I just not seeing it do you guys know?

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
I do know

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
I freaking played it in E3

57:25.000 --> 57:29.000
I was like oh my god Stargate because I am a big Stargate fangirl

57:29.000 --> 57:34.000
Okay I have all eight box sets and I'm eagerly awaiting the ninth

57:34.000 --> 57:37.000
And I was like they made a life sized Stargate thing up here

57:37.000 --> 57:44.000
And I like wanted to stand in it and see if if I if the big you know if the event horizon was splashed out at me and everything

57:44.000 --> 57:47.000
Except that that would have vaporized me so I would have stayed out of the way

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
Do you mean?

57:49.000 --> 57:54.000
I know the answer I know the answer to the guys question but I can't talk

57:54.000 --> 57:57.000
It was cancelled they did cancel it

57:57.000 --> 58:04.000
If you want however I did take pictures of their area I took pictures of the game

58:04.000 --> 58:09.000
I can get all that up actually it's I should our gallery from that E3 should still be up

58:09.000 --> 58:10.000
I think it is

58:10.000 --> 58:16.000
So a lot of my pictures are there you can check them out on in our picture gallery on orangeoutradio.com

58:16.000 --> 58:21.000
Everyone remembers why did they cancel that because Stargate really does have a nerd-tastic following to it

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
That's not a bad thing it's a good show

58:23.000 --> 58:28.000
It's a first person shooter and I think it was really great

58:28.000 --> 58:32.000
I wish they had kept going with it because I mean I would have bought that day one

58:32.000 --> 58:37.000
Solarwing in the chat room read my mind Battlestar Galactica the video game

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
That's just a matter of time yes?

58:39.000 --> 58:43.000
One would hope I want a Doctor Who video game because I'm into my Doctor Who fandom

58:43.000 --> 58:46.000
But as for the very end I'm also becoming a bit confused

58:46.000 --> 58:50.000
Would it be possible for you guys to list every gaming console you have ever owned in your long lifespan please?

58:50.000 --> 58:55.000
We do not have a show long enough because I still currently own them

58:55.000 --> 59:01.000
Unless you've got time for me to list off about 47 video game systems sorry

59:01.000 --> 59:08.000
You know I was just thinking if they made video games out of TV shows I watch

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Video game industry would die

59:10.000 --> 59:14.000
Big Brother the video game

59:14.000 --> 59:18.000
For anyone that reads my live journal I never talk about games I just talk about the TV show Big Brother

59:18.000 --> 59:21.000
Can you imagine Big Brother the video game

59:21.000 --> 59:27.000
Three people in my car me who does not watch TV I just buy box sets talking about Big Brother

59:27.000 --> 59:31.000
Press the A button to continue

59:31.000 --> 59:34.000
But first a live eviction never mind

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
If you watch Big Brother you get it

59:36.000 --> 59:42.000
Anyway Eric thanks for writing in and yeah no more Stargate that pisses me off too

59:42.000 --> 59:47.000
I am such a Stargate fangirl because it's all about Michael Shanks

59:47.000 --> 59:51.000
Even though you hate me I'm mad about the Stargate news too

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
He doesn't hate you

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
DMN hates me there it is in chat

59:55.000 --> 59:56.000
What?

59:56.000 --> 59:57.000
I love you

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
DMN you bastard

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
He doesn't really hate me and look

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Solarwing says Big Brother could be an MMO vidpower admits to watching Big Brother

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:11.000
I know we have UK listeners and I know it's a completely different show here than it is over there

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
But I know it's crazy over there

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Anyway sorry video games yes

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Okay this one comes from Distinct

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Hey all the store I run sells games and we've got release dates for Wii games coming November 1

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
I know these usually change a lot

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.000
But I think if Nintendo was going to do an October launch then the games would be listed for October

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000
So it looks like to me the Wii is going to drop a week or two before the PS3

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Which we have dates for games as well and they're all around the same time as the PS3 launch

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Here are some release dates for other titles

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Loki probably is on top of this already

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
But in case something is different from what you've heard

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Lost Planet Xbox 360 January 31

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Soprano Xbox 360 November 14

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Darkness Xbox 360 March 31

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Superman Xbox 360 December 1

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Rainbow Six Vegas on Xbox 360 November 15

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000
And a lot of other titles dropping the same time as the PS3 launch

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Oddly enough we have no confirmed date for Gears of War

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Which actually had a date announced to the press

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Anyway great show I thought I'd try and give some info but like I said you probably noticed this already

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Did you post some of that? I don't know I don't remember

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Well I mean it's different sources though because this person says they work on the retail end

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000
So sometimes it's interesting to see where the distribution end and where you are in the retail end

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Where this listener is you know

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.000
That's pretty accurate we've got dates that are in November and we've got dates that are

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.000
We have a lot that are in November 1st and a lot that are on the 15th

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
I think those are all placeholder dates right now

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
But it is supposed to be like we mentioned last week

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000
No it wasn't last week it was the week before last I think

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
I can't remember I get my weeks old script

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000
As we mentioned it is going to be probably a November launch

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000
And that was a big you know to do thing

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Also what was I going to say? I thought the Supranus game was cancelled

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
I think it was I thought it was

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Yeah I thought it was

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000
But yeah our purchasing people haven't taken it out of our system either

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000
But I know

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Maybe it wasn't

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
You know I was cleaning up my Xbox hard drive this week

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000
And I was deleting the Superman Returns trailer for the game

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
And I watched it one more time and I think I might want to pick up that game

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000
I really might

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Sometimes it's not as awful as the one that was on the Nintendo 64

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Oh yeah no no no

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
At E3 it was awesome

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Imagine Grand Theft Auto but you're Superman

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Hey I'd be all over that

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000
It'll be as badass as Superman on the Atari 2600 was

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Or maybe what was it?

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Death and Return of Superman one of the few beat-em-ups Blizzard ever made

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Okay well anyways

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.000
While we're on the subject here I thought I would you know clear up a few things

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Let's see as far as release dates go

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000
I think that was about right

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Remember I know Lost Planet is coming out in January

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Because they were saying that no other games are coming out in January

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
And you'll pretty much own January

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Now I know there have been a lot of

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
I'm sure that you saw this too

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000
In our wonderful Under the Radar thread that we have in our forums

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000
There have been a lot of the stories that we've been talking about

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Have appeared and reported by other news sources

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.000
As well as you know current topics and people have been sourcing them

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Like for example I think when we talked about winning the 11th revolution in 2007

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Bobby we mentioned this and freaking goes to IGN you know

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Who reported the exact same thing

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Bobby bad Bobby Black Wolf

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000
I know he doesn't listen to the show very much but

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Bad Bobby no cookie for you

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Well to go ahead and gear this back towards the email

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000
You've got a story coming up that addresses something we brought up last week

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
You're trying to make a preemptive strike here

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Let her finish the damn email

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Warrior Bob writes in and says

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Hey there OLR crew it's been like a year or something since I've written in

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
But you're still awesome and I'm still listening

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Thanks for all the great podcasts

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Comments for each of you

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Sky I was just listening to your last podcast and you were asking about

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Disconnects in Street Fighter 2 HF on Xbox Live

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Well I can assure you that a disconnect counts as a win for the person who didn't disconnect

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Oh

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Because I got my achievement for 20 wins online when the other guy timed out

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Hot okay good

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Good to know thank you

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Loki

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:28.000
So a friend of mine runs a college radio show about video games at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000
And called me on frequently as a co-host

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Like any person I've got influence in how I approach something

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000
And after a few months of broadcasting I realized that even if I don't agree with you all the time

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Even most of the time

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Your style on air is basically my biggest influence and I wanted to write and say so

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
So that you can have the ego boost you rightfully deserve

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Aww

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000
My style on air

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
That was the equivalent of a man hug I think

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
That was very nice

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
One to me by right is a false icon

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Yes

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Damn them to hell

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Wow my ears are ringing

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Sorry

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
I held the microphone away

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Oh I know

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Didn't help me in studio

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000
You guys all rule and I look forward to this week's show just like I do every week take care

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Aww so nice

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Aww I love the ego boost email

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Maybe we should run down to Cal Poly and do a show

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
I think so

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Was that the same person that wanted us to go there to do some type of panel thingy

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
That was about a year ago

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
We couldn't make it at that time

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
It didn't work out unfortunately but

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
We need to go on the road

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
We need to go on a college tour across America

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Make sure that you have kegs with good beer

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Just bring Guinness kegs

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Bring Guinness bring bass

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Dronami will be our roadie

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Bring me some fat tire

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Chris can be our tour manager

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Uhh sure

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
She can bring us coffee and donuts

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Oh yes and lesbian

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:52.000
There will be massive lesbian pillow fights at every after party

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Huh Loki? Huh? Huh?

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
I guess

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Me I'm old I go to bed early

01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Alright next

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000
I like pillow fights

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Next email

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Hey O.L.R. this is from DMN oh my god

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Hi DMN and this is the one that I said I would read

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.000
I was wondering what your opinion on Guitar Hero 2 retailing for $49.99

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
This being for the game only

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Do you guys think that with this being the first music game being priced for over $40

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
That the sales of this game will be hampered

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Or will this encourage the sale of the bundle to people who already own the game

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Also your thoughts on Dance Factory thanks

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.000
I haven't played Dance Factory yet so I can't give a fair opinion on it

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Same here

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Maybe I'll check it out but it honestly

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.000
I've seen these dance games that use your own music before

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000
And haven't been very impressed so I don't see where this one's gonna win me over

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
It thinks it's accurate but it's not

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:50.000
It can't make accurate steps the same way that a step artist

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
To borrow a term from Roxor can

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:57.000
So it can't be as good as DDR in the groove even

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
I can't imagine

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:03.000
As far as Guitar Hero 2 going for $49.99 I do think that's a bit excessive for price

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:07.000
I think that for those of us who already have it

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:12.000
The game should retail around I'd say between $30 and $40

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000
And make a really good deal for the guitar bundle

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000
It's like $60 for the guitar bundle or something like that

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:23.000
That's how I think it should be $50 for the game only is excessive I believe

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Alright

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Given that I spent that on the guitar and game bundle last time

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Well you know everybody's gonna pay it anyway

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Yeah

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Is that it for email?

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
By the way Addict

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Oh shit

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Who played last week's show for her?

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000
She's not supposed to

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000
No

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000
My informant in the chatroom right now told me

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.000
And I was gonna say something last week and I took mercy on you

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000
But DEAR GOD IN HEAVEN WHY

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Rob is back on Final Fantasy XI

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
You traitor

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000
You are a traitor and a liar

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000
And you need to be spanked

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Chris spank him for me

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000
A little harder please

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000
You

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Quit World of Warcraft

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
I can't quit World of Warcraft

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
My account is still active

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:23.000
You sit down and you sit down in your goddamn chair and drink your goddamn tea

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Orange Lounge Radio is quite possibly the only podcast

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Video game podcast on the entire internet

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.000
That has lesbian spanking gay men

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Over MMOs

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:43.000
And to correct myself is sit your ass down in that chair and drink your goddamn tea

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Lesbians are always relevant

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
I um

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
You have a hot ass Rob

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Thank you

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Um

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Mikotov

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Gave me cookies

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
I don't know what else to say

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Oh my god

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:05.000
GS68 said that I was using a level 4 limit break

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.000
And DJ Janae wants me to hit him with the yaoi paddle stick

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
I need to make one

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Okay

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
What's this we're going to yaoi con?

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
I heard that coming out of your mouth

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
I heard this we're going to

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:23.000
No, we as in me and Chris and Megzia and another one of our friends

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Is going to yaoi con this year

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
So we need to make yaoi behave paddles

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Alright look we gotta wrap this up

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Cause we still have DDR

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
We saw the DDR previous to get to this segment

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
And whoever that little rat informant is in chat

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
I'm gonna find you I'm gonna get you

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
I know it's DMN I know it's him

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
No it's not DMN

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Don't worry I'm going to own DMN anyway

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
I'm going to figure out who you are I'm going to beat you up

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Uh send an email

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Mailbag at orange times radio

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Sorry orange time I love you

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
I'm coming to New York too

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
And I'm bringing my yaoi paddle

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
By the way

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
DMN says fuck you Rob

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Check

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
You name the time and the place I'll be there no pants

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Tape it

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
New year

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
I'm turning this car around

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
And we are going back to on topic road

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Right now

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Check the orange times radio forums

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Because Sky is coming to New York City

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
In October and we'll be doing a meet up

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
I think at the Nintendo store

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Uh possibly somewhere else

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
I'm not sure yet

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
But check the forums for more information if you're in New York City

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Cause I want to meet some fans

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
And maybe tape a live segment or something

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
I'll just have a part on the show

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Alright back to games

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Super Paper Mario a game I'm very very much looking forward to

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
That was going to be coming out for the GameCube

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Um is now not going to be coming out for the GameCube

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Rumor

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Well it's a rumor but this seems like a pretty good one to me

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Rumored until Thursday when they announced it officially

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.000
I don't understand why they would continue to build all these GameCube games

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Well I mean I guess the Wii can play them

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Yeah

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
You know what I think

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
This obviously is going to be coming out for the Wii

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
This is coming off some IGN dude's blog

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
That says hmm how should I write this

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Have to be vague you know

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Let me just say that yes Paper Mario will be headed to Wii and not GameCube

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Now read between the lines damn you wait

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
That was a terrible hint

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Alright that's it for today time to beat Bozone

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.000
And that was coming from Matt Casamassina from IGN

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Who apparently gets more insider knowledge than we do

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Whatever

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Look I would bet anything maybe it's one of those games where

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:39.000
There's more features on the Wii than there are on the GameCube

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Not like Zelda where there's two separate versions

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:47.000
But I think about those games like the Zelda games that were on the Color Game Boy

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
When you put them in the advance you got the advance store

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Like what was it Oracle of Ages Seasons whatever that was

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
You had like extra stuff if you played it in the advance

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
That would seem logical to me and a very Nintendo thing to do

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
That's pretty interesting

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:05.000
That Matt Casamassina or whatever guy really has the inside scoop

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Oh wait no he doesn't

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.000
That's right because he just did an interview with Ubisoft about GT

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.000
And well he just found out guess what that they're coming out with

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000
I know that I'm sure it's the first that you've ever heard of it

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
They're coming out with the steering wheel attachment

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000
That's going to come out for the Wii game GT

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Wait a second didn't some podcast talk about that last week?

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Okay to this credit though I'm actually going to give the doubt

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.000
If they went to Ubisoft and talked about it directly they probably didn't get it from the show

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:41.000
But doesn't that validate what you were saying last week at least part of it?

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:48.000
What I'm saying I don't say that it's not legit and they stole the story or whatever the case may be

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:53.000
I didn't say that at all but I'm just saying that I'm not just spouting off crap here

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
That this stuff is actually real

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Maybe you should fucking listen people

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Seriously

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
If anybody's wrong it's the sales people

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
All you're doing is you're saying things the sales people told you

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000
But yeah it's very interesting I've been reading forums this week

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Because we've been getting a lot of hits on that story

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
And of course we can see where the hits are coming from

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:14.000
It's very interesting to read people's opinions on our credibility

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
For example other things that kind of go along with that

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:22.000
1UP ran a story this week talking about the PS2 Slim coming out in a silver color

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
As we reported on episode 196

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Kotaku reported on a brand new PSP Entertainment bundle that's going to be coming out

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.000
As we reported on episode 196

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:38.000
This story of course we talked about came out last week we talked about that

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:44.000
IGN also ran a story about the grim adventures of Billy and Mandy coming out for the Wii

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
As reported on episode 195

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
And then

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Yeah so

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
It's not a big surprise here

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000
You know what our t-shirts should have that big

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Should have that picture of the alien spaceship that you see on it

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000
And it says I believe and then in parenthesis OLR

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000
That could be our shirts

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:09.000
I want to believe OLR

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:14.000
And as I was mentioning earlier when I was yelling at Bobby

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.000
The thing was he was talking about a story today on his podcast

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:24.000
About how Provolution Soccer 2007 is not going to be exclusive to the 360 as Microsoft stated

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Well we also mentioned that I think it was on 198

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
That that was not the case

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000
That it was actually still in development and that kind of stuff

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Okay big deal

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
We're just giving Bobby a hard time

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
I know we love Bobby

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Bobby is awesome but I always have to give him

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Allgames.com Sunday night it's 5 o'clock

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Bobby Black Wolf Show it's rad

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
So alright

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Are we ready for the next story?

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Next story

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
I don't know I think I'm going to like Boycott

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Why?

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Because I don't like this game

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Well read it anyway

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Anyway there is going to be a progressive scan in 16 to 9 widescreen mode

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
For Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000
On what system does it say?

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Well it's only for the Wii

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Oh the Wii?

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.000
You know what that's neat that's great but not too surprising

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Because when we saw Elibits at the Konami thing it was running widescreen

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Yeah and I think they were supposed to be doing 480p and widescreen on the games anyways

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Weren't all the games we saw at E3 on widescreen?

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
I think so

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.000
It's kind of weird

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000
I mean not to belittle your story but I'm just saying because somebody else picked up that story

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.000
I'm just kind of like well weren't they all kind of showing in widescreen anyway?

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.000
I don't know

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Maybe because people are ragging on the graphics of the Wii saying it's not going to be as good as the other systems

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.000
I think it looks fine

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Here's something to show that hey at least they still support widescreen

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.000
It's a little something

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.000
And also they showed the first screenshots of GT on IGN

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
And it actually looks pretty cool it's all cel-shaded

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:04.000
So it kind of reminds me a little bit of like Crazy Taxi but a racing game

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
So I don't know I like it

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Alright cool

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:15.000
I just wanted to point out as well I saw part of the reason that Final Fantasy 12 has taken an incredible amount of time to come out here in the US

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Is that they actually added in the American version widescreen support

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000
So that's going to be pretty cool

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.000
So you can have like in Dragon Quest 8 you know supported widescreen as well

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Thank you Squeenix for supporting widescreen on the current gen consoles

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.000
That's very nice of you

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.000
I can't wait to check that out

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Some interesting stuff that's going to be coming out also with the Wii

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000
And this is rumor for now

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:36.000
A list of the launch titles for the virtual console

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.000
And I think most of this is speculation but

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:44.000
You know as I mentioned with the Wii date stories and anything like that that's going on

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.000
We're going to know September 14th it's going to be the big news

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
All this stuff so

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.000
For now if you want to speculate on it in a couple days here you go

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:59.000
The list some of the notables on there Box Adventure, Castlevania, Duck Hunt

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Excitebike, F-Zero, Kid Icarus, The Legend of Zelda

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.000
The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, Mario Kart 64

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:11.000
The original Metroid, Mortal Kombat, New Adventure Island, Ninja Gaiden

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Outrun, Pac-Man, Prince of Persia

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
I imagine the original

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Punch Out, R-Type, Rayman 2, Sonic the Hedgehog

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Star Fox, Super Mario 64, Super Mario Brothers, Super Mario Kart

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Super Mario World, and Tecmo Bowl

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000
It's so weird, a rat, the best football game ever made

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
None of us need Blades of Steel

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:37.000
But isn't it weird to hear R-Type and Outrun alongside Legend of Zelda and Kid Icarus

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:42.000
By the way, thank you to somebody at Nintendo for showing Kid Icarus a little bit of love

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.000
R-Type

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:51.000
I want to know, I've only known two people who can beat R-Type on one credit

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:56.000
I want to know who else of our listeners can do it, send me an email

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.000
I want to know where some of the more Genesis games are

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Because in the mail they'll probably just slowly roll out, don't you think?

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.000
I don't know, I'm kind of a wait and see, I want to see how this thing's going to look

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Because to be honest, the virtual console is awesome and stuff

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
But it's not why I'm buying the system

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Alright, well now we're going to get into a part of the show that I think a lot of you guys have been waiting for

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:27.000
We're going to play some new tracks from the brand new DDR games, UltraMix 4 and DDR Universe

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Of course, Dance Dance Revolution UltraMix 4 is coming out later this year for the Xbox

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:35.000
You guys know the UltraMix series by now, it's brought a lot of great music to us

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Synth-pop style music from a different drum label, as well as a lot of brand new mixes

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:44.000
And the last game especially was really diverse in the selection

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Even some folks criticized it for how diverse it was

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.000
But it's going to be interesting, I think you're going to find that UltraMix 4

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.000
The song list was previously announced and posted to our website

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:57.000
There's a lot of very interesting and diverse tracks in this game as well

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:01.000
A lot of new originals, and we're going to be playing for the next few weeks on our show

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:04.000
So not just tonight guys, but over the next few weeks

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Every week we're going to be doing some previews of new tracks from DDR UltraMix 4 and DDR Universe

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.000
DDR Universe being the game that's coming out for the Xbox 360

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Either later this year or early, early next year

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.000
It's still a little bit unknown, I think they're still aiming for this year on the Xbox 360

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:26.000
And that's of course DDR's first, well your system is saying December still, right?

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Yeah

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Sounds good, that'll be good

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.000
American Idol, Karaoke Revolution got pushed to January

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Oh, that's a bummer

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Well maybe it's to actually get Paula in

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.000
I think so

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.000
That would be nice, that would be nice

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Well that makes sense though, because American Idol would come out when the show comes out, right?

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.000
I thought December was a bit early for American Idol, because the show doesn't start until January

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Alright, well anyway, let's get into the DDR

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:53.000
So, tonight we're going to debut two songs from DDR Universe and two songs from DDR UltraMix 4

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.000
And that's pretty much going to be the same rhythm we're going to do throughout the promotion

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
As two songs from each game each week

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.000
And I guess we should just get it started, shouldn't we?

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:05.000
So here's tonight's first song, tonight's first song is from DDR Universe

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:10.000
And this first one is going to be a long version, because we have some long versions sprinkled out throughout the promotion

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:14.000
This is a brand new original song, and it's by an artist called Drew Campbell

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000
And the song is called 8-Bit

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:22.000
And I think what you're going to dig about this song is that the title describes the sound of the song

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.000
So I think you guys are going to really dig this track

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:33.000
So here it is, to kick off our series of DDR Sneak Peaks here on Orange Lounge Radio

01:20:33.000 --> 01:21:01.000
This is Drew Campbell with 8-Bit from DDR Universe, the long version

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:13.000
So here it is, to kick off our series of DDR Sneak Peaks here on Orange Lounge Radio

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:43.000
So here it is, to kick off our series of DDR Sneak Peaks

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:13.000
So here it is, to kick off our series of DDR Sneak Peaks

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:43.000
So here it is, to kick off our series of DDR Sneak Peaks

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:13.000
So here it is, to kick off our series of DDR Sneak Peaks

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:43.000
So here it is, to kick off our series of DDR Sneak Peaks

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Coming soon to DDR Universe, that was Drew Campbell with 8-Bit here on Orange Lounge Radio

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
The DDR Sneak previews

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:29.000
And speaking of 8-Bit, we've been running a contest here on the program recently

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:35.000
It's called Beat the Host, and it had to do with guessing the songs that we were playing from 8-Bit video games of the past

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:38.000
And we have one of the winners on the line with us tonight

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Say hello to DMN everybody, how are you doing DMN?

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Are you a big DDR fan?

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.000

And I'm very excited about this song we're going to play for you guys

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Because it involves a long time favorite DDR artist here at Orange Lounge Radio

01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:01.000
It's a remix of a song from the Echoing Green, so this is coming to us I believe from the A Different Drum License

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
And it's remixed by Echo Image

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:08.000

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Remixed by Echo Image, Heart With a View here on Orange Lounge Radio, DDR Sneak Peaks

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Do you find that you're haunted by reflections in your eyes?

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Do you mind that you're haunted?

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Look into the sky, feel the wind blow

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Look into my eyes, there's a place to go but I can't sense the sun

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:16.000
There's a pain that won't stop the sun

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:27.000
There's a place to go but I can't sense the sun

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:37.000
There's a place to go but I can't sense the sun

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:47.000

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Government is a cool problem

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Government is not the solution to our problem

01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Government is a cool problem

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:14.000
