[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

00:20.166 --> 00:26.089
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this very special Part C to celebrate our 200th episode.

00:26.129 --> 00:31.751
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I want to warn you guys, if this is your first time downloading Orange Lounge Radio, this is going to be a little bit different.

00:31.771 --> 00:44.577
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not your typical segment of Orange Lounge Radio, so I urge you to check out OrangeLoungeRadio.com and dip back in our podcast feed and check out Parts A and B. We envision this section of the show to be a little more like our afterbirth segment.

00:44.617 --> 00:46.218
[SPEAKER_03]: For those that listen live, you know what that is.

00:46.278 --> 00:48.219
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bonus thing we do just for the live listeners.

00:49.039 --> 00:50.720
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have a little bit more game news.

00:50.760 --> 01:02.583
[SPEAKER_03]: We just filled up with stuff in Part B and just had a little more we wanted to talk about here in Part C. But first, before we get to that gaming news, what we did is we brought in a little bit of champagne.

01:02.643 --> 01:04.724
[SPEAKER_03]: I promised there would be liquor tonight in one form or another.

01:05.624 --> 01:07.745
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do a toast here to our 200th episode.

01:08.125 --> 01:10.305
[SPEAKER_03]: So does anyone want to make the toast or should I just do it or what?

01:10.325 --> 01:11.466
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone want to say a little bit?

01:11.486 --> 01:11.986
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:12.186 --> 01:12.406
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:12.711 --> 01:13.892
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:42.133 --> 01:43.574
[SPEAKER_03]: That's some good Korbel.

01:46.977 --> 01:48.078
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not a big champagne fan?

01:48.578 --> 01:52.221
[SPEAKER_21]: I like champagne, but I really like it in a good mimosa.

01:55.744 --> 01:58.287
[SPEAKER_21]: When we reach 300, we toast Guinness.

01:58.467 --> 01:59.948
[SPEAKER_03]: 250 is a big number too, I don't know.

02:01.049 --> 02:04.732
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's going to be more at the 5th birthday, because 5th birthday is pretty big, so we'll see.

02:05.310 --> 02:09.454
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, Jamie already burped the Korbel.

02:09.514 --> 02:10.235
[SPEAKER_03]: That's amazing.

02:10.375 --> 02:11.356
[SPEAKER_22]: That's some fizzy stuff.

02:11.376 --> 02:12.217
[SPEAKER_03]: That is amazing.

02:12.537 --> 02:15.881
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we have a little bit of extra stories here for you guys.

02:15.921 --> 02:16.161
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki?

02:16.782 --> 02:24.089
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, lots of fun stuff for Part C. Anyways, I really shouldn't be paying attention.

02:24.169 --> 02:25.791
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, chat room, for your well wishes, by the way.

02:28.205 --> 02:30.187
[SPEAKER_29]: There's been a lot of rumors going around about the 360.

02:31.488 --> 02:38.853
[SPEAKER_29]: One that keeps popping back up is Microsoft's going to release a brand new 360 with an internal HD DVD drive.

02:39.892 --> 02:42.213
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, once again, they have said no.

02:42.513 --> 02:46.454
[SPEAKER_29]: We are not releasing a SKU with an HD DVD drive.

02:46.494 --> 02:59.659
[SPEAKER_29]: It says, turns out you want to say in how you spend your, or turns out you want to say in how you spend your entertainment dollars, so who are the ones, or, so who are we to burden every customer with the cost of expensive movie technology?

03:00.820 --> 03:01.100
[SPEAKER_29]: Ooh!

03:01.120 --> 03:03.681
[SPEAKER_29]: Serve, Sony!

03:04.981 --> 03:05.101
Ouch.

03:07.008 --> 03:10.030
[SPEAKER_03]: That was Bill Gates whipping it out right there.

03:10.790 --> 03:14.272
[SPEAKER_29]: No, that was actually a generic Microsoft employee.

03:14.412 --> 03:17.374
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, that was a Microsoft employee whipping out their cock.

03:17.394 --> 03:18.955
[SPEAKER_21]: No, that was one of their technical writers.

03:19.696 --> 03:20.096
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

03:21.036 --> 03:22.978
[SPEAKER_21]: This is why I'm in school, to be a tech writer.

03:23.998 --> 03:24.258
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

03:24.278 --> 03:26.360
[SPEAKER_21]: So that I, too, can whip out the corporate cock.

03:30.482 --> 03:32.203
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't need a corporate cock, I just need a cock.

03:33.464 --> 03:34.425
[SPEAKER_21]: Your girlfriend's is still bigger.

03:34.825 --> 03:35.045
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway.

03:35.065 --> 03:35.145
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

03:37.434 --> 03:40.796
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, Megzi!

03:41.857 --> 03:42.517
[SPEAKER_21]: We love you!

03:45.039 --> 03:54.065
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, there is actually the GameU College Tour will be making the rounds.

03:54.145 --> 03:58.287
[SPEAKER_21]: It will be featuring the Xbox 360, Xbox, and PC gaming.

03:58.888 --> 04:00.228
[SPEAKER_21]: The tour will last three months.

04:02.377 --> 04:05.480
[SPEAKER_21]: and it will hit up 40 different college campuses.

04:05.560 --> 04:13.206
[SPEAKER_21]: It's produced by Game Informer, Norsent TV and Mountain Dew and a bunch of other folks.

04:13.906 --> 04:18.810
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's going to hopefully reach 90,000 different people.

04:19.751 --> 04:28.378
[SPEAKER_21]: Some of the titles that are included are Madden NFL 07, blah, blah, blah, Rainbow Six, Saints Row, Mortal Kombat, Armageddon,

04:29.830 --> 04:35.880
[SPEAKER_21]: America's Army Special Forces, Splinter Cell Double Agent, blah blah blah, Project Gotham 3, Dead Rising.

04:35.900 --> 04:38.244
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, all the games Jamie does not enjoy playing.

04:38.465 --> 04:39.126
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, Dead Rising!

04:39.507 --> 04:40.148
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's cool.

04:40.428 --> 04:41.450
[SPEAKER_21]: Dead Rising was hot.

04:43.095 --> 04:47.779
[SPEAKER_21]: And there will be a Madden NFL 07 football field goal competition.

04:48.380 --> 04:51.622
[SPEAKER_21]: And the winners take home $1,000 as the prize.

04:51.803 --> 04:58.248
[SPEAKER_21]: And Game Informer will have a Halo 2 competition each place with an unnamed prize, it seems.

04:58.809 --> 05:04.634
[SPEAKER_21]: So the tour starts on September 14th at the University of Arizona in Tucson.

05:06.255 --> 05:08.897
[SPEAKER_21]: Other schools that will be visited will be...

05:10.735 --> 05:11.555
[SPEAKER_21]: Just general places.

05:11.755 --> 05:17.217
[SPEAKER_21]: They will be going to Austin, Texas, University of Texas, University of Missouri, Wichita State.

05:17.798 --> 05:18.818
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just listing a few.

05:18.878 --> 05:25.280
[SPEAKER_21]: Vanderbilt, Northern Kentucky, Temple University, Penn State.

05:26.341 --> 05:31.703
[SPEAKER_21]: They'll be going to, I guess, State University of New York.

05:31.923 --> 05:32.483
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that what it is?

05:34.004 --> 05:34.504
[SPEAKER_21]: In Buffalo.

05:35.224 --> 05:37.065
[SPEAKER_21]: And Miami University of Ohio.

05:38.125 --> 05:38.906
[SPEAKER_21]: That always makes me laugh.

05:38.966 --> 05:39.966
[SPEAKER_21]: And, of course, Notre Dame.

05:41.103 --> 05:43.146
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

05:43.827 --> 05:48.693
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if the game isn't coming to you, maybe you need to bring the game with you everywhere you go.

05:49.034 --> 05:51.056
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, you know those little plug-and-play things, right?

05:51.096 --> 05:52.879
[SPEAKER_03]: The little joysticks you can plug into your TV.

05:52.899 --> 05:54.641
[SPEAKER_03]: You see them sell these at Target all the time, right?

05:55.014 --> 05:58.235
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, these things are getting smaller and smaller, and now check this out.

05:58.495 --> 06:01.295
[SPEAKER_03]: They now have keychain plug-and-plays.

06:01.715 --> 06:09.076
[SPEAKER_03]: A little teeny Atari joystick and a little teeny Atari paddle that you can take with you to play games on the go.

06:09.877 --> 06:11.337
[SPEAKER_03]: They have actual games in these.

06:11.437 --> 06:14.297
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an included six-foot cable that comes with it.

06:14.637 --> 06:20.098
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on a battery-powered reel, and you put it on the keychain here, and then you can plug it in and play.

06:20.458 --> 06:23.099
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one joystick that will have asteroids and millipede,

06:23.479 --> 06:29.181
[SPEAKER_03]: another with Centipede and Yar's Revenge, and then the paddle will have Pong, Breakout, and Warlords.

06:29.921 --> 06:30.782
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.

06:31.622 --> 06:35.983
[SPEAKER_03]: The keychain comes with a separate pocket-sized reel that holds six feet of cords and RCA jacks.

06:36.304 --> 06:41.966
[SPEAKER_03]: It's powered by three AAA batteries, single player only, however, since it is just a little keychain.

06:42.366 --> 06:42.686
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.

06:42.706 --> 06:45.827
[SPEAKER_21]: I wonder what the original Atari programmers think of these.

06:46.480 --> 06:47.381
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I gotta wonder.

06:47.401 --> 06:53.323
[SPEAKER_21]: That's at Next Classic Gaming Expo that they do, because, you know, they skipped a year for Classic Gaming Expo so they could do the 10th anniversary.

06:53.503 --> 06:53.724
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

06:53.864 --> 06:57.465
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm definitely going and I'm going to ask them what they think of that, because that's just crazy.

06:58.986 --> 07:05.409
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68 says, I'm left-handed, I demand a lefty stick or I will refuse to buy Atari 2600 or related crap.

07:05.990 --> 07:09.031
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTetsuya in our chat says, shame the paddle won't link up with three others.

07:09.871 --> 07:11.092
[SPEAKER_03]: So, sad.

07:12.242 --> 07:16.666
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, what we're going to do now, I think that was about all the gaming news we have.

07:16.686 --> 07:19.648
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get some last minute stories in a minute if any folks have stuff.

07:19.668 --> 07:21.149
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, first, we have these.

07:21.189 --> 07:23.791
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to play these since we are celebrating our 200th episode.

07:24.352 --> 07:28.135
[SPEAKER_03]: We got sent a surprise from All Games, our buddies at All Games.

07:28.515 --> 07:31.357
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I was going to go ahead and play this so we could hear this.

07:34.480 --> 07:36.761
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, Krop, did you hear the news?

07:37.542 --> 07:37.902
[SPEAKER_23]: What news?

07:38.643 --> 07:41.365
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lounge Radio is doing their 200th episode this week.

07:42.185 --> 07:42.445
[SPEAKER_23]: What?

07:44.386 --> 07:42.445
200?

07:45.026 --> 07:46.486
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

07:47.247 --> 07:49.667
[SPEAKER_28]: Nice dedication for you.

07:49.687 --> 07:50.127
[SPEAKER_28]: 200 shows.

07:50.147 --> 07:50.127
200.

07:50.287 --> 07:52.348
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a lot.

07:52.368 --> 07:53.849
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, it is.

07:55.349 --> 07:59.110
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you think we'll ever reach that level of dedication?

07:59.130 --> 08:01.351
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, my contract is only for 30.

08:03.231 --> 08:03.952
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a contract?

08:03.972 --> 08:04.052
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops.

08:10.788 --> 08:18.792
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey there, this is Scott from All Games Interactive wishing the guys and girls at Orange Lounge Radio a happy 200th episode.

08:19.292 --> 08:22.954
[SPEAKER_00]: Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki, you guys kick ass.

08:22.974 --> 08:28.637
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, to celebrate, we are going to spend the next four days playing DDR and listening to DDR music.

08:28.917 --> 08:35.100
[SPEAKER_00]: So, from everyone here at the Arena Lounge... Congratulations, OLR!

08:35.240 --> 08:36.321
[SPEAKER_00]: ...on 200 episodes.

08:36.341 --> 08:37.141
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys rock.

08:37.702 --> 08:39.162
[SPEAKER_14]: I love you.

08:43.638 --> 08:47.320
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you realize how cool it'd be if I could actually play V and have it sound like this?

08:47.420 --> 08:50.881
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, anyway, Bobby Blackwolf here from that show that comes on before you guys.

08:51.401 --> 08:51.861
[SPEAKER_28]: 200, eh?

08:52.382 --> 08:53.002
[SPEAKER_28]: Y'all cheated.

08:53.642 --> 08:55.463
[SPEAKER_28]: Counting all those years of internet radio and all.

08:55.943 --> 08:58.864
[SPEAKER_28]: But don't worry, Scott's funky episode numbering will catch up in about a month.

08:59.545 --> 09:03.826
[SPEAKER_28]: But seriously, y'all were one of the reasons I started podcasting and I enjoy you guys each week.

09:04.567 --> 09:06.187
[SPEAKER_28]: Good luck to all of you in the future.

09:06.768 --> 09:09.049
[SPEAKER_28]: And make sure it doesn't go downhill from here.

09:11.210 --> 09:11.990
[SPEAKER_28]: Someone had to say it.

09:15.543 --> 09:16.743
[SPEAKER_28]: That was wonderful.

09:16.943 --> 09:18.004
[SPEAKER_03]: That was so cute.

09:18.024 --> 09:18.864
[SPEAKER_03]: That was so cute.

09:18.924 --> 09:20.084
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what else to say.

09:20.324 --> 09:23.705
[SPEAKER_21]: Just the thing that had me cracking was, you had a contract?

09:24.025 --> 09:26.206
[SPEAKER_03]: That was Kropotkin and Hendrix from the show Between Us.

09:26.506 --> 09:30.127
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, who were all those people at Arena yelling in the background there?

09:30.167 --> 09:31.747
[SPEAKER_03]: That was kind of interesting.

09:31.988 --> 09:32.788
[SPEAKER_03]: They hired people.

09:33.288 --> 09:35.168
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they must have hired stand-ins to do that.

09:35.268 --> 09:35.849
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

09:35.869 --> 09:38.309
[SPEAKER_21]: Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

09:38.329 --> 09:38.489
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

09:38.509 --> 09:39.830
[SPEAKER_21]: I want my second glass of champagne.

09:41.370 --> 09:41.970
[SPEAKER_29]: Good for you.

09:43.431 --> 09:44.511
[SPEAKER_29]: Did you want my glass of champagne?

09:45.410 --> 09:46.631
[SPEAKER_21]: That was unintentional.

10:02.222 --> 10:03.363
[SPEAKER_03]: Scott's full of shit sometimes.

10:04.323 --> 10:06.004
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if he's really going to do, yeah, sometimes.

10:06.284 --> 10:08.405
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if he's really going to do four days of DDR.

10:08.725 --> 10:10.285
[SPEAKER_03]: I cannot picture him playing DDR.

10:10.566 --> 10:12.666
[SPEAKER_03]: But if they do, is Black Boy still listening?

10:13.027 --> 10:13.727
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, I don't think he is.

10:13.787 --> 10:15.988
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody videotape it over at Arena Lounge.

10:16.868 --> 10:19.929
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn it, that Rob shit in the chat room needs to stop right now.

10:22.951 --> 10:24.091
[SPEAKER_03]: They are just flooding our chat.

10:24.111 --> 10:26.332
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I've done that since, like, what, episode one?

10:26.372 --> 10:27.453
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.

10:27.893 --> 10:28.213
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

10:28.874 --> 10:33.498
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, all games, we love those guys, and thank you guys so much for getting in on that and putting that together for us.

10:33.518 --> 10:34.099
[SPEAKER_03]: That was awesome.

10:35.120 --> 10:38.343
[SPEAKER_03]: Our fans also decided to ambush our voicemail line this week.

10:38.843 --> 10:40.104
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, we have fans on our website too.

10:40.344 --> 10:44.248
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we had some voicemails hit our voicemail line this week, so we're going to play that as well.

10:45.109 --> 10:47.130
[SPEAKER_23]: Hello, Orange Lounge Radio.

10:47.791 --> 10:49.773
[SPEAKER_23]: Happy 200th episode.

10:50.493 --> 10:51.174
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

10:51.915 --> 10:52.976
[SPEAKER_23]: I love you guys.

10:53.776 --> 10:54.617
[SPEAKER_23]: You're a lover.

10:55.098 --> 10:55.238
[SPEAKER_23]: No.

10:56.070 --> 11:02.454
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm calling to congratulate you guys on your 200th episode.

11:23.553 --> 11:34.995
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know many podcasts at all, I'll be honest, but you guys have been around for a while, I've heard about you for a while, I just started being a part of the station in a bigger way, and I love you guys.

11:35.335 --> 11:37.055
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep up the good work, here's to another 200.

11:37.095 --> 11:39.196
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys all take care.

11:39.336 --> 11:40.456
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, it's Miss Steve.

11:52.765 --> 12:01.409
[SPEAKER_22]: and I'm pretty certain that I'm going to be listening tonight anyway, but I just wanted to say in a more personal way, congrats on reaching episode 200.

12:01.910 --> 12:02.210
[SPEAKER_22]: Bye.

12:05.691 --> 12:06.152
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

12:06.612 --> 12:07.532
[SPEAKER_03]: That was really sweet, you guys.

12:07.552 --> 12:08.373
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

12:11.274 --> 12:18.978
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I like the guy, I think it was Yuri Lever who sounded like he was talking and he just had this... Red vs. Blue, who is that?

12:19.930 --> 12:20.331
[SPEAKER_19]: Caboose!

12:20.371 --> 12:20.791
[SPEAKER_19]: Caboose!

12:20.851 --> 12:21.792
[SPEAKER_19]: He sounded like Caboose!

12:23.153 --> 12:24.974
[SPEAKER_19]: I have to go to the bathroom now.

12:24.994 --> 12:25.174
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh-oh.

12:25.194 --> 12:25.274
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

12:25.294 --> 12:26.035
[SPEAKER_21]: What'd he say?

12:26.115 --> 12:26.835
[SPEAKER_21]: Are you getting it?

12:26.875 --> 12:27.976
[SPEAKER_21]: We can't hear it.

12:27.996 --> 12:33.120
[SPEAKER_19]: We can't hear it.

12:33.260 --> 12:33.681
[SPEAKER_19]: What's he saying?

12:33.701 --> 12:35.362
[SPEAKER_21]: Just tell us what he's saying.

12:35.422 --> 12:35.462
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

12:49.349 --> 12:50.370
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, put on speakerphone.

12:51.170 --> 12:51.590
[SPEAKER_03]: One second.

12:51.630 --> 12:52.551
[SPEAKER_03]: We warned you guys it would be random.

12:53.571 --> 12:53.811
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

12:55.592 --> 12:56.172
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this your husband?

12:56.332 --> 12:56.833
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Dan.

12:56.893 --> 12:57.113
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

12:57.633 --> 12:58.033
[SPEAKER_21]: Say it again.

12:59.634 --> 13:02.815
Congratulations on your 200th episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

13:03.356 --> 13:05.657
Man, I didn't think you'd make it to, you know, two.

13:05.677 --> 13:07.017
We didn't think we'd make it to two either.

13:07.057 --> 13:07.198
Wow.

13:07.218 --> 13:08.558
That was nice.

13:08.618 --> 13:09.979
[SPEAKER_23]: Everybody's getting in on the love.

13:09.999 --> 13:10.699
You're still on speakerphone.

13:22.328 --> 13:23.188
[SPEAKER_03]: Close the damn phone.

13:23.208 --> 13:24.229
[SPEAKER_03]: We got other stuff to get to.

13:24.649 --> 13:25.229
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell him to wait.

13:25.249 --> 13:26.750
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye, sweetie.

13:27.430 --> 13:27.811
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

13:30.112 --> 13:30.432
[SPEAKER_21]: Dork.

13:31.533 --> 13:33.353
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I'm saying this on the radio.

13:33.434 --> 13:34.694
[SPEAKER_21]: My husband is a dork.

13:35.695 --> 13:36.855
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, he buys you pinball.

13:37.276 --> 13:39.777
[SPEAKER_21]: But he brings me pinball, so that's why I keep him around.

13:40.537 --> 13:41.458
[SPEAKER_03]: This is great radio.

13:41.498 --> 13:43.219
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're all drinking champagne.

13:43.239 --> 13:43.579
[SPEAKER_03]: What can I say?

13:43.599 --> 13:44.980
[SPEAKER_21]: This is the second time Dan's been on the show.

13:45.040 --> 13:46.360
[SPEAKER_03]: This is great champagne.

13:47.801 --> 13:49.042
[SPEAKER_03]: Any last-minute stories tonight?

13:49.082 --> 13:49.342
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

13:49.895 --> 13:51.715
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, of course I have stuff.

13:51.895 --> 13:56.816
[SPEAKER_29]: Anyways, the first thing I want to talk about is release dates, because of course I have stuff.

13:57.296 --> 14:01.617
[SPEAKER_29]: And it's all very interesting and always very controversial.

14:02.157 --> 14:08.298
[SPEAKER_29]: This mostly is from Sega, who we've had some problems with in the past about Fantasy Star Universe.

14:08.338 --> 14:13.039
[SPEAKER_29]: But anyways, let's talk about next-gen, shall we?

14:13.319 --> 14:17.280
[SPEAKER_29]: Virtual Fighter V for the PlayStation 3 is slated to come out...

14:18.038 --> 14:20.759
[SPEAKER_29]: March 15th of next year, so look forward to that.

14:20.999 --> 14:29.722
[SPEAKER_29]: Also, you know, Gracie and her presence will be Virtual Tennis 3 for both the PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360, and the PSP.

14:29.902 --> 14:33.843
[SPEAKER_29]: All those coming out on the 21st of March next year.

14:35.384 --> 14:39.725
[SPEAKER_29]: This one we ran on the site also, and this is probably the first you'll hear of it.

14:40.666 --> 14:44.107
[SPEAKER_29]: Full Auto 2 coming to the PSP March 14th.

14:45.345 --> 14:47.486
[SPEAKER_29]: So it's not just PlayStation 3 anymore.

14:47.826 --> 14:49.186
[SPEAKER_29]: Very interesting on that.

14:50.467 --> 14:57.869
[SPEAKER_29]: And then this one, which is very controversial, since there was some news from FromSoftware that this version might be not coming out.

14:58.549 --> 15:05.732
[SPEAKER_29]: Coming from Sega, Armored Core 4 on both the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360, March 21st.

15:06.212 --> 15:12.334
[SPEAKER_29]: These dates were just updated in our system on the 11th of September, so this is very fresh news.

15:13.552 --> 15:17.454
[SPEAKER_29]: Also, Afterburner for the PSP coming out March 21st as well.

15:17.574 --> 15:22.497
[SPEAKER_29]: So, look for those wonderful Sega games March of next year.

15:23.617 --> 15:26.499
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'm going to open up the Skype line over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

15:26.519 --> 15:30.101
[SPEAKER_03]: Click on Interact With Us or you can always call us on the regular telephone as well.

15:30.141 --> 15:30.301
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 916-226-9067.

15:33.007 --> 15:35.629
[SPEAKER_03]: I imagine the sky plane is going to be very popular tonight.

15:35.669 --> 15:37.090
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get through as many calls as we can.

15:37.130 --> 15:38.912
[SPEAKER_03]: We're practically dedicating a whole segment to it.

15:38.952 --> 15:39.332
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

15:40.253 --> 15:43.095
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're already coming in, so let's pick up a call and start going.

15:43.395 --> 15:44.456
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

15:44.476 --> 15:44.856
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

15:45.417 --> 15:46.137
[SPEAKER_20]: This is Megzi.

15:46.157 --> 15:47.798
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, Megzi.

15:47.978 --> 15:48.939
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you, Megzi?

15:49.299 --> 15:50.440
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, I just went deaf.

15:50.460 --> 15:51.161
[SPEAKER_20]: I am fantastic.

15:51.281 --> 15:53.703
[SPEAKER_03]: From all the girly screaming in here, I think I just went deaf.

15:54.463 --> 15:55.004
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind?

15:56.205 --> 15:56.525
[SPEAKER_03]: We.

15:57.386 --> 15:58.046
[SPEAKER_03]: We.

15:58.567 --> 16:01.589
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you excited about the We News, or are you just celebrating our 200th episode with us?

16:02.691 --> 16:03.171
[SPEAKER_20]: A little bit of both.

16:03.511 --> 16:04.012
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

16:04.112 --> 16:05.252
[SPEAKER_03]: You definitely going to be getting a Wii?

16:06.093 --> 16:06.673
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, man.

16:07.554 --> 16:14.858
[SPEAKER_20]: The morning after I knew, I had called my GameStop at 9 in the morning to see if we could do reserves yet, and unfortunately we couldn't.

16:14.898 --> 16:16.359
[SPEAKER_20]: But yes, I will be getting a Wii.

16:17.139 --> 16:17.719
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

16:18.500 --> 16:19.500
[SPEAKER_03]: What games do you want to pick up?

16:19.760 --> 16:22.462
[SPEAKER_20]: I would like to stress that I predicted the date.

16:24.088 --> 16:25.190
[SPEAKER_03]: How did you predict the date?

16:25.230 --> 16:26.432
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you just pull it out of your butt?

16:37.316 --> 16:38.557
[SPEAKER_20]: that holiday season.

16:39.418 --> 16:49.727
[SPEAKER_20]: And the PS3 launches on a Friday, the 17th is a Friday, and I know Nintendo likes to launch their systems on Sundays, so I said, hey, Sunday the 19th, that could be their release date.

16:49.747 --> 16:50.468
[SPEAKER_20]: That's my prediction.

16:51.148 --> 16:56.493
[SPEAKER_20]: And then not three hours later, the information got leaked that it was going to be released on that Sunday.

16:57.234 --> 17:03.679
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sitting here looking at a text message on my phone that says, November 19th, from Megzi.

17:04.020 --> 17:04.420
Ha ha ha!

17:05.216 --> 17:07.778
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, good job on that, making an educated guess to do it.

17:07.858 --> 17:11.141
[SPEAKER_03]: So, your internet penis grew by two inches for that.

17:11.181 --> 17:13.763
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.

17:13.843 --> 17:15.024
[SPEAKER_20]: I've also got a funny story.

17:15.284 --> 17:15.504
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

17:15.544 --> 17:16.525
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, the funny story.

17:17.085 --> 17:21.709
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so, lately I've been trying to catch up on games that I might have missed.

17:22.409 --> 17:25.051
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, like they came out and they were great, but for some reason I didn't pick them up.

17:25.612 --> 17:28.234
[SPEAKER_20]: So, the other day I picked up Metroid Prime, right?

17:28.774 --> 17:31.496
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I never got a chance to play it and I wanted to try it out.

17:32.137 --> 17:32.357
[SPEAKER_20]: So...

17:33.078 --> 17:38.100
[SPEAKER_20]: After I got off work, I called Chris, and... Chris is looking angry at this story already.

17:38.360 --> 17:41.001
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, she's just like... Alright, let's hear it.

17:41.021 --> 17:49.223
[SPEAKER_20]: So, I called up Chris, and I was like, so this is what I did during my day, and I picked up Metroid Prime, and she says, oh, is that the one with the monkey?

17:53.284 --> 17:54.685
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, poor Chris.

17:56.585 --> 17:58.026
[SPEAKER_03]: We love you, Chris.

17:58.186 --> 18:01.487
[SPEAKER_20]: And so, we decided we're going to make a game called Metroid Primate.

18:03.178 --> 18:04.298
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought it was a different game.

18:04.378 --> 18:06.439
[SPEAKER_19]: I did not claim to be an expert on video games.

18:07.119 --> 18:09.060
[SPEAKER_20]: I know, but Metroid and a monkey.

18:09.360 --> 18:11.701
[SPEAKER_20]: What was your... I'm going to prove to you.

18:11.841 --> 18:12.862
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought it was a different game.

18:12.882 --> 18:15.062
[SPEAKER_20]: That's why you thought it was like Dungeon Siege or something.

18:15.202 --> 18:15.963
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I didn't.

18:16.203 --> 18:17.103
[SPEAKER_20]: I thought it was an RP.

18:17.123 --> 18:18.403
[SPEAKER_21]: Megzie, it's Dungeon Zoo.

18:18.724 --> 18:19.084
[SPEAKER_21]: Shut up.

18:19.384 --> 18:21.345
[SPEAKER_21]: Dungeon Zoo.

18:21.405 --> 18:26.506
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm still going... Megzie, we need to start doing pictures of Metroid primates.

18:27.107 --> 18:27.627
[SPEAKER_20]: Hells yeah.

18:27.907 --> 18:28.287
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

18:30.004 --> 18:31.085
[SPEAKER_03]: Heart, we love you, Chris.

18:31.105 --> 18:32.266
[SPEAKER_21]: You hear this?

18:32.346 --> 18:33.426
[SPEAKER_21]: She's invited the biteage.

18:33.786 --> 18:38.789
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to point out, though, WonderDogHerald in our chatroom says, Samus with a pet monkey would be the best.

18:40.189 --> 18:43.351
[SPEAKER_14]: I bet she'd... She had a pet monkey.

18:43.391 --> 18:44.191
[SPEAKER_14]: We love you, Chris.

18:44.211 --> 18:49.974
[SPEAKER_29]: Speaking of pets, you heard this week that they announced Seaman 2 for the PlayStation 2 coming out.

18:50.054 --> 18:50.754
[SPEAKER_29]: Tee hee.

18:51.135 --> 18:51.375
[SPEAKER_29]: What?

18:51.395 --> 18:51.675
[SPEAKER_29]: Tee hee.

18:53.756 --> 18:54.076
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

18:54.356 --> 18:57.838
[SPEAKER_03]: Macy, we've got to take some more calls because everybody's trying to get in tonight, but any last words?

19:01.644 --> 19:02.885
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, Reggie, you're so fine.

19:02.905 --> 19:03.385
[SPEAKER_20]: You're so fine.

19:03.405 --> 19:04.025
[SPEAKER_20]: You blow my mind.

19:04.045 --> 19:04.506
[SPEAKER_20]: Hey, Reggie.

19:04.866 --> 19:05.026
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey.

19:05.506 --> 19:06.026
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

19:06.326 --> 19:08.447
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-oh, your girlfriend's getting upset that you're a Reggie fan.

19:08.907 --> 19:09.548
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry.

19:10.368 --> 19:10.648
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

19:11.709 --> 19:12.569
[SPEAKER_03]: Aw, Chris is pouting.

19:12.589 --> 19:13.570
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to say anything to Macy, Chris?

19:14.530 --> 19:16.031
[SPEAKER_19]: I love you, but I hate you.

19:16.051 --> 19:16.891
[SPEAKER_19]: I love you, too.

19:16.911 --> 19:18.732
[SPEAKER_19]: I hate you so much.

19:20.493 --> 19:20.893
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, Chris.

19:21.213 --> 19:23.634
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what that... Macy, Macy, you know what that means, though?

19:23.834 --> 19:24.474
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what that means, though?

19:24.834 --> 19:25.895
[SPEAKER_03]: Makeup sex.

19:26.535 --> 19:27.316
[SPEAKER_20]: Ooh.

19:27.456 --> 19:27.756
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

19:27.816 --> 19:28.236
[SPEAKER_03]: See you later.

19:31.161 --> 19:33.363
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you were making a trip to Wisconsin pretty soon, Chris.

19:33.383 --> 19:34.543
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I'm going next weekend.

19:34.584 --> 19:36.044
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's going to be lots of makeup sex.

19:36.345 --> 19:37.325
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots and lots of makeup sex.

19:37.665 --> 19:39.547
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange... Whoa, we're getting feedback.

19:39.567 --> 19:40.367
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

19:40.387 --> 19:40.707
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

19:41.588 --> 19:42.008
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, hello?

19:42.248 --> 19:42.508
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

19:44.409 --> 19:46.631
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this is, uh, Bob Coffey from the chat room.

19:46.951 --> 19:47.952
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Bob Coffey, what's on your mind?

19:47.972 --> 19:53.115
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting a lot of feedback, some type of hum, humming hum hum from you, so ask your question and we'll answer it.

19:53.195 --> 19:58.458
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, um, just like to congratulate you guys on the 200th episode, and, um,

19:59.289 --> 20:04.192
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting thing about the Wii is... What's that?

20:05.252 --> 20:07.233
[SPEAKER_05]: Um... Hello?

20:07.593 --> 20:08.274
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, we're here.

20:08.714 --> 20:10.035
[SPEAKER_05]: Get your thought out, please.

20:10.875 --> 20:21.061
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, interesting thing about the Wii, though, is... The one... The fact, um... N64 launched at, um... Originally $249.

20:22.381 --> 20:24.442
[SPEAKER_05]: But right before they launched, they cut it to $199, so...

20:27.898 --> 20:29.699
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, very interesting thought.

20:29.819 --> 20:38.504
[SPEAKER_05]: Good chance Nintendo might just cut the price right at the last minute, kind of as a, you know, kicking it to the sand to Sony.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.205
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be an interesting technique.

20:40.866 --> 20:41.166
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

20:41.206 --> 20:44.988
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's basically a comment I'd like to make, and...

20:46.587 --> 20:48.309
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry about the shitty first call.

20:48.329 --> 20:48.869
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all right.

20:48.909 --> 20:49.169
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.

20:49.189 --> 20:51.131
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a bad hum, so that's all right.

20:51.151 --> 20:53.433
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be able to hear it and try to figure out what the problem is.

20:53.453 --> 20:54.534
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to let you go, though, buddy.

20:54.814 --> 20:55.635
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks so much for the call.

20:55.655 --> 20:56.756
[SPEAKER_03]: We like hearing from new people.

20:57.116 --> 21:02.541
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting thought that Nintendo 64 was going to be $249 when it first came out, and then they cut the price at the last minute.

21:02.581 --> 21:03.382
[SPEAKER_03]: Could that happen again?

21:03.802 --> 21:05.844
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the pack-in game kind of breaks the steel here.

21:05.884 --> 21:09.647
[SPEAKER_03]: I think with Wii Sports being in there, I think $250 is kind of set in stone.

21:10.188 --> 21:12.190
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see it getting cut at the last minute, but who knows?

21:12.710 --> 21:13.751
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything's possible, right?

21:14.560 --> 21:14.940
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?

21:15.120 --> 21:18.022
[SPEAKER_29]: I think it all comes down to their feedback that you get from people.

21:18.523 --> 21:19.383
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's go to another call.

21:19.403 --> 21:20.244
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

21:20.264 --> 21:20.584
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

21:21.825 --> 21:23.666
[SPEAKER_09]: Greetings, my brethren and sister-in.

21:25.167 --> 21:26.367
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Mel B, actually.

21:26.648 --> 21:27.608
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Mel!

21:27.668 --> 21:27.828
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi!

21:27.908 --> 21:28.469
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow!

21:28.969 --> 21:30.490
[SPEAKER_03]: Mel, you were here forever ago.

21:30.510 --> 21:33.372
[SPEAKER_03]: You've known of Orange Launch Radio since episode, like, six.

21:34.380 --> 21:36.282
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much.

21:36.322 --> 21:39.384
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen you in, like, what, maybe three different studios already?

21:39.484 --> 21:41.706
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we've been to a lot of different places.

21:41.886 --> 21:43.488
[SPEAKER_03]: We've gotten evicted from a lot of places.

21:44.008 --> 21:44.829
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind, buddy?

21:45.669 --> 21:50.453
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well, you know, it's 200, and you know I had to weigh in, you know, say congratulations to you guys.

21:50.834 --> 21:51.634
[SPEAKER_29]: Appreciate it.

21:52.295 --> 22:00.081
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's just, I'm just really proud of how you guys have grown, like, within this 194 episodes, I guess, since I'd first seen you.

22:00.702 --> 22:03.304
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I can remember back in the day when, you know, it was like,

22:03.752 --> 22:16.462
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys would have to be scrapping to get contact left and right and like, you know, I'd be trying to hook you up with this and now you guys are like making a name on your own and it's like, you know, I can just fade in the background and I mean, you guys have just been darn good ever since.

22:16.823 --> 22:20.505
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we appreciate you, you know, taking a chance on the show when it was such a little deal.

22:20.525 --> 22:23.308
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you were a big name in the DDR scene for freestyle and everything.

22:23.328 --> 22:25.590
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, still are too, just, you know, DDR in general.

22:25.950 --> 22:32.295
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you haven't had a lot of tournaments lately but, you know, you came on our show kind of early on and a lot of people recognize you from freestyle so,

22:33.048 --> 22:33.549
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

22:33.769 --> 22:36.931
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it kind of enabled us to be all friends and stuff after that.

22:37.071 --> 22:40.313
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was kind of a big thing to have Mr. DDR Idol on there.

22:40.333 --> 22:42.715
[SPEAKER_09]: Cutting one of those first radio promos for you back then.

22:42.735 --> 22:43.895
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was awesome.

22:44.156 --> 22:47.518
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do you think of the DDR scene now versus four years ago when the show started?

22:48.699 --> 22:59.766
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, I mean, a lot of it's kind of, I mean, it's been a major shift, whereas before it was sort of like a, kind of like a 60-40 split, whereas like Freestyle was bringing in a lot of casual people in.

23:00.137 --> 23:03.738
[SPEAKER_09]: But now it's become such a technical sport now with Perfect Attack and whatnot.

23:03.838 --> 23:05.578
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty much a standard now.

23:05.659 --> 23:09.960
[SPEAKER_09]: Freestyle is sort of like, I think people just aren't pushing each other nowadays to be better.

23:10.020 --> 23:12.720
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just kind of like waiting for some tournament to come around.

23:12.740 --> 23:15.301
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just doing something good enough to win.

23:15.381 --> 23:18.362
[SPEAKER_09]: So there really just isn't that progress forward quite yet.

23:18.882 --> 23:23.783
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't see one up because Supernova's got so many darn songs that, you know, people were begging for.

23:23.883 --> 23:25.524
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, what can you do?

23:25.604 --> 23:25.844
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean...

23:26.263 --> 23:31.825
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure I'm going to break out some more routines sooner or later, but, you know, until then, I guess I'll just be laying in the cut.

23:32.205 --> 23:37.067
[SPEAKER_03]: Is In The Groove partially to blame for Freestyle going down and PA going up?

23:39.468 --> 23:54.473
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, there just wasn't that much to do in In The Groove for Freestyle, but I think kind of, I think with Freestyle it was just sort of like to the point where I think, I mean, just kind of looking back now, just in retrospect, I think a good Freestyle sort of has a very short

23:55.850 --> 24:07.618
[SPEAKER_09]: LifeSpan, I guess if you could say, it's sort of like you're hot for a good six months or a year, but then afterward, it's like judges, you know, get tired of your act and, you know, they want to see something new, but no one who's really stepped up since like 2003, 2004.

24:09.199 --> 24:12.682
[SPEAKER_03]: So, well, I hope Supernova can turn some of that around.

24:12.702 --> 24:13.422
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we'll see, huh?

24:14.423 --> 24:14.843
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm pretty sure.

24:14.903 --> 24:19.767
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I do know some people that are still hungry and waiting for their big chance to, you know, break out on the team that I think...

24:20.675 --> 24:27.320
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got to be the onuses on a lot of people who are big into freestyle community that still have name value to put together events.

24:27.340 --> 24:30.122
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't even have to be like a tournament for a thousand bucks or whatever.

24:30.142 --> 24:36.166
[SPEAKER_09]: If you just get good get-togethers, you know, just videotape it and, you know, just get the word around by, you know, whatever.

24:36.306 --> 24:36.706
[SPEAKER_09]: YouTube.

24:36.786 --> 24:38.167
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll get people back into Spain.

24:38.488 --> 24:38.688
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

24:39.028 --> 24:42.590
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it'll be very interesting to see what happens, you know, in the future and everything.

24:42.650 --> 24:45.272
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know OLR wants to do some type of DDR tournament.

24:45.332 --> 24:46.173
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got some ideas.

24:46.233 --> 24:47.594
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see what happens in the future.

24:48.240 --> 24:50.502
[SPEAKER_09]: You can definitely count on me to give you a hand with that one.

24:50.682 --> 24:51.383
[SPEAKER_03]: Appreciate it, buddy.

24:51.403 --> 24:53.205
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to let you go to take more calls, so thanks so much.

24:53.265 --> 24:55.146
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really good to hear from you on this landmark episode.

24:55.847 --> 24:57.108
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, man.

24:57.168 --> 25:01.072
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations to all you three, and Madden rules, and screw you guys for hating it.

25:01.092 --> 25:02.233
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't hate Madden.

25:02.253 --> 25:02.773
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't hate it.

25:02.813 --> 25:06.016
[SPEAKER_03]: We just don't, you know, freaking foam at the mouth over it, but, you know.

25:06.997 --> 25:08.458
[SPEAKER_02]: Different strokes for different folks.

25:09.139 --> 25:10.040
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, but it's all good.

25:10.100 --> 25:10.700
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all take it easy.

25:10.720 --> 25:11.061
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all good.

25:11.081 --> 25:11.661
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one, buddy.

25:12.202 --> 25:12.322
[SPEAKER_03]: Later.

25:12.342 --> 25:12.522
[SPEAKER_03]: Later.

25:13.686 --> 25:17.047
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, you mean Roster Update 2006 is the actual name of the game.

25:17.087 --> 25:17.608
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm teasing.

25:17.648 --> 25:18.448
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to another call.

25:18.768 --> 25:19.728
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

25:19.748 --> 25:20.109

25:21.209 --> 25:22.610
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, this is SSJ100 Matt.

25:22.770 --> 25:23.830
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, SSJ100 Matt.

25:23.850 --> 25:24.450
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind, buddy?

25:25.611 --> 25:30.793
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to congratulate you on the 200 episodes and everything.

25:32.013 --> 25:33.254
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we appreciate that a lot, buddy.

25:34.774 --> 25:36.035
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind with all the Wii news?

25:37.175 --> 25:37.335
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

25:37.615 --> 25:38.776
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind with all the Wii news?

25:41.468 --> 25:43.229
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just thinking about my bank account, really.

25:44.789 --> 25:46.209
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to be getting a PS3, too?

25:49.150 --> 25:50.211
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll be selling a PS3.

25:50.251 --> 25:53.132
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're going to do one of those eBay things.

25:53.972 --> 25:54.312
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

25:54.712 --> 25:55.452

[SPEAKER_25]: two things yep

26:37.025 --> 26:41.409
[SPEAKER_25]: First, congratulations on having 200 episodes.

26:41.549 --> 26:42.250
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you very much.

26:42.270 --> 26:43.090
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.

26:43.791 --> 26:49.436
[SPEAKER_25]: I have a few friends with their podcasts and trying to get first live radio and then podcast.

26:50.437 --> 26:52.038
[SPEAKER_25]: It's amazing that you guys have made it this far.

26:52.098 --> 26:54.120
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a big landmark.

26:54.460 --> 26:56.522
[SPEAKER_03]: We're amazed, too, that we've lasted this long.

26:56.602 --> 26:57.643
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something else.

26:57.743 --> 27:04.069
[SPEAKER_03]: I think probably it's crossed all three of our minds at one point or another that we wanted to quit, but there's something that always brings us back.

27:05.385 --> 27:06.385
[SPEAKER_03]: I never do that.

27:07.466 --> 27:09.746
[SPEAKER_03]: I will admit, there was one week where it was pretty bad.

27:09.786 --> 27:12.447
[SPEAKER_03]: I was having a really emo week and I was about ready to come on here and go, I quit!

27:13.407 --> 27:21.348
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, in the end, it's really, you know, it's about you guys and about, you know, of course, Loki and DarkSakura, just getting to hang out with them every week and everything.

27:21.388 --> 27:27.290
[SPEAKER_03]: And while we may have our ups and downs sometimes, you know, it all comes back to games here at Orange Launch Radio, so it's good.

27:28.310 --> 27:29.430
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the great equalizer.

27:31.170 --> 27:34.251
[SPEAKER_25]: The second thing was, I saw the Nintendo Wii Plus conference

27:34.764 --> 27:36.644
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, what'd you think?

27:37.084 --> 27:39.225
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, yay that it's coming out so early.

27:39.765 --> 27:41.905
[SPEAKER_25]: I was half thinking it was going to be delayed.

27:42.806 --> 27:44.586
[SPEAKER_25]: But, you know, they actually kept it.

27:45.466 --> 27:53.688
[SPEAKER_25]: And they also were talking about how you can put videos on the memory card and play them back.

27:55.208 --> 28:01.689
[SPEAKER_25]: Now, do you think with codecs and all that, do you think everything's going to work universally or you could just download something?

28:03.062 --> 28:06.244
[SPEAKER_25]: or pay 20 Wii Points and get the newest codec that works with everything?

28:07.185 --> 28:07.886
[SPEAKER_25]: Do you have a thought, Loki?

28:08.546 --> 28:14.670
[SPEAKER_29]: It's all up to the, you know, what they're running as far as graphics, you know, a graphics card in there.

28:14.991 --> 28:17.893
[SPEAKER_03]: Would it be licensing with the codecs, too, could come into play?

28:18.033 --> 28:19.414
[SPEAKER_29]: Some codecs are free, but yeah.

28:19.774 --> 28:22.036
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, this is whatever they want to do.

28:22.116 --> 28:27.740
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, I'm sure it's going to support, like, MPEG-2 and stuff like that because, I mean, they were basically kind of thinking...

28:28.544 --> 28:33.085
[SPEAKER_29]: Can you take your camcorder and you plug in your SD memory card from that into there and you get to watch videos.

28:33.745 --> 28:34.386
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

28:35.686 --> 28:36.046
[SPEAKER_29]: All right.

28:36.066 --> 28:37.887
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, are you going to be picking up a Wii?

28:39.027 --> 28:39.407
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, yes.

28:39.847 --> 28:40.247
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

28:40.827 --> 28:44.628
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm picking up the PS3 and... You are going to get a PS3.

28:45.409 --> 28:46.129
[SPEAKER_03]: I told you I had to.

28:46.169 --> 28:49.150
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's right, that's right, because you had to buy the one for your friend because of the bet and everything.

28:49.230 --> 28:50.990
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, you're not going to buy one for yourself?

28:52.511 --> 28:53.771
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, the Wii for myself, yes.

28:53.831 --> 28:54.071
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

28:54.091 --> 28:56.011
[SPEAKER_03]: The PS3, hell no.

28:56.312 --> 28:56.692
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

28:56.752 --> 28:57.832
[SPEAKER_03]: Why no PS3 for yourself?

28:58.547 --> 29:02.650
[SPEAKER_25]: There's nothing at launch that really drives for me to get it.

29:03.490 --> 29:07.513
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony's going to have to sell it, really, really sell it to Tokyo Game Show to show us why we need one at launch.

29:07.613 --> 29:08.274
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be interesting.

29:10.755 --> 29:11.036
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

29:11.516 --> 29:11.956
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem.

29:12.016 --> 29:15.278
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, we've got to let you go, buddy, because we've got more calls coming in, but thanks so much for calling in tonight.

29:15.959 --> 29:16.119
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

29:16.279 --> 29:16.779
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, later.

29:17.560 --> 29:18.461
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots and lots of calls tonight.

29:18.481 --> 29:19.181
[SPEAKER_03]: We really appreciate it.

29:19.902 --> 29:20.682
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to another call.

29:20.702 --> 29:21.923
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my gosh, we're getting so many calls tonight.

29:22.623 --> 29:23.724
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

29:23.764 --> 29:24.184
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

29:25.385 --> 29:26.206
[SPEAKER_06]: Raven Stolfen.

29:26.386 --> 29:27.146
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Raven Stolfen.

29:27.166 --> 29:27.807
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind, buddy?

29:28.942 --> 29:32.023
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry I'm on my cell phone, but this is Skype's working.

29:32.283 --> 29:34.764
[SPEAKER_03]: That's alright, you know, we're getting hammered left and right tonight.

29:34.784 --> 29:35.284
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind?

29:37.365 --> 29:40.225
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I got a hairline fracture on my DS.

29:41.166 --> 29:41.946
[SPEAKER_03]: How'd that happen?

29:43.566 --> 29:47.728
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, and I replaced it, and EB charged me 50 bucks for it.

29:48.128 --> 29:48.448
[SPEAKER_03]: Ouch!

29:48.808 --> 29:50.949
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't have one of those replacement policy things or whatever?

29:51.989 --> 29:55.850
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I had it, but they'll trade it in, and you'll get a black one.

29:56.988 --> 29:58.049
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, huh, interesting.

29:58.709 --> 30:00.990
[SPEAKER_03]: Was this a DS Lite that cracked, or a DS Fat?

30:02.190 --> 30:04.131
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it was a Lite, and I was pissed.

30:04.331 --> 30:06.652
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, yeah, I got a lot of problems with that.

30:06.912 --> 30:11.174
[SPEAKER_03]: But didn't Nintendo do some type of replacement system, or was that just the UK?

30:11.274 --> 30:12.634
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember, it's been so long now.

30:13.775 --> 30:15.755
[SPEAKER_03]: They charge you 50 bucks to replace it?

30:17.276 --> 30:18.076
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it your fault?

30:19.737 --> 30:20.537
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it wasn't.

30:20.557 --> 30:22.738
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing, they replaced it,

30:23.294 --> 30:24.975
[SPEAKER_06]: But it would only be a white one.

30:25.035 --> 30:27.316
[SPEAKER_06]: It wouldn't be a free black one, which pissed me off.

30:28.056 --> 30:28.576
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I see.

30:28.636 --> 30:31.838
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, did you have a black one or did you have a white one and you wanted to get a black one?

30:32.818 --> 30:35.199
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a white one and I wanted to get a black one.

30:35.219 --> 30:36.780
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, well, that's why they charged you for it.

30:37.040 --> 30:38.540
[SPEAKER_03]: God, it's just a stinking color, though.

30:38.580 --> 30:42.222
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess, you know, maybe there's more demand for the black ones right now or something.

30:42.262 --> 30:42.582
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

30:42.842 --> 30:43.742
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you want a black one?

30:43.762 --> 30:44.643
[SPEAKER_03]: It wouldn't match your Wii.

30:46.023 --> 30:47.764
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, everyone wanted a black one.

30:47.784 --> 30:49.205
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't you say you wanted a pink one?

30:49.285 --> 30:50.085
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a pink one.

30:51.121 --> 30:53.282
[SPEAKER_03]: I almost bought one at Walmart, but I'm poor.

30:54.442 --> 30:56.183
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we don't make money off OLR.

30:57.524 --> 30:57.984
[SPEAKER_03]: But someday.

30:59.264 --> 30:59.544
[SPEAKER_03]: Someday.

30:59.925 --> 31:02.286
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Ravenstaff, anything else on your mind, Ravenstaff?

31:02.306 --> 31:03.746
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we have to get two more calls.

31:04.767 --> 31:05.287
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sure.

31:05.487 --> 31:06.747
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one more thing on my mind.

31:06.807 --> 31:07.027
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

31:10.129 --> 31:11.469
[SPEAKER_06]: They're doing the right thing with it.

31:13.050 --> 31:13.350
[SPEAKER_03]: How so?

31:14.929 --> 31:20.854
[SPEAKER_06]: because how the name is and how they're setting it up, they're really putting Sony in jeopardy this time.

31:21.734 --> 31:22.215
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

31:22.355 --> 31:25.057
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll all see after the Christmas season when the numbers come out.

31:25.537 --> 31:26.478
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you might be right, though.

31:27.959 --> 31:29.800
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I'm definitely trying to get a Wii.

31:29.961 --> 31:34.484
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to stand in the freezing cold on a Walmart or at EB.

31:34.624 --> 31:35.685
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm paying someone to get it.

31:36.218 --> 31:46.502
[SPEAKER_03]: Just let's hope that whole little thing about what they're supposedly doing in Hawaii with the whole $50 to reserve or $50 in trade-ins to reserve doesn't catch on nationwide because that's kind of poopy.

31:47.382 --> 31:47.822
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see.

31:48.102 --> 31:49.183
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, all right, guys.

31:49.223 --> 31:52.824
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to cut it short and go because... All right.

31:53.044 --> 31:53.925
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all good, buddy.

31:54.645 --> 31:55.085
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one.

31:55.525 --> 31:55.705
Bye.

31:55.905 --> 31:56.226
[SPEAKER_03]: Later.

31:57.546 --> 31:59.887
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, we're just getting more and more calls.

31:59.907 --> 32:00.767
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just keep it going.

32:00.807 --> 32:01.127
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

32:01.167 --> 32:02.968
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a whole other section of the show here tonight.

32:03.008 --> 32:04.048
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to another call.

32:04.108 --> 32:04.949
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

32:04.969 --> 32:05.249
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

32:06.002 --> 32:06.623
[SPEAKER_03]: It's me, Ranma.

32:06.663 --> 32:07.283
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, fellas?

32:07.383 --> 32:08.164
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, how you doing?

32:08.344 --> 32:08.865
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, wait a minute.

32:08.885 --> 32:09.725
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing good.

32:09.826 --> 32:11.567
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not believe the lady sitting behind me is a fella.

32:12.688 --> 32:14.450
[SPEAKER_21]: Ranchan, how could you forget?

32:15.271 --> 32:18.694
[SPEAKER_24]: I splashed you with stupid stuff from China.

32:18.734 --> 32:19.154
[SPEAKER_24]: What can I tell you?

32:19.174 --> 32:19.835
[SPEAKER_24]: I am not cursed.

32:20.615 --> 32:20.876
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

32:21.296 --> 32:22.217
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind, Ranma?

32:22.757 --> 32:23.138
[SPEAKER_24]: Not much.

32:23.178 --> 32:23.758
[SPEAKER_24]: A few things.

32:23.818 --> 32:27.001
[SPEAKER_24]: I finally saw Dance Revolution yesterday, and it wasn't that bad.

32:27.522 --> 32:27.822
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

32:27.922 --> 32:30.164
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard it was vomit in my mouth.

32:30.364 --> 32:31.105
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's interesting?

32:31.125 --> 32:31.165
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

32:31.661 --> 32:35.124
[SPEAKER_03]: The show is not being carried in Sacramento, so we couldn't see it.

32:35.404 --> 32:37.306
[SPEAKER_24]: Wait, it's not on a CBS out there?

32:37.506 --> 32:38.467
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not on a CBS.

32:38.687 --> 32:41.149
[SPEAKER_29]: I looked at the preview guide and there was not anything there.

32:41.329 --> 32:42.870
[SPEAKER_03]: So kudos to KLVR 13.

32:43.591 --> 32:45.933
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job, guys.

32:45.993 --> 32:47.254
[SPEAKER_03]: No crap on that network.

32:47.294 --> 32:47.654
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job.

32:47.674 --> 32:48.635
[SPEAKER_03]: Does Viacom own them?

32:49.035 --> 32:52.818
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know, but I heard there was no actual DDR stuff on the show.

32:52.839 --> 32:53.299
[SPEAKER_03]: There wasn't.

32:53.920 --> 32:56.322
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same font, and that's about it.

32:56.922 --> 33:03.846
[SPEAKER_24]: It's basically Dance Fever with little kids, and it's a contest, and the grand prize is a $25,000 scholarship from Konami.

33:03.966 --> 33:05.928
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so why was that not shitty?

33:06.888 --> 33:08.509
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know, because I thought it wasn't so bad.

33:08.569 --> 33:09.650
[SPEAKER_24]: It broke the mold.

33:09.730 --> 33:12.292
[SPEAKER_24]: Everybody was thinking it was going to be DDR this, DDR that, you know?

33:14.893 --> 33:16.074
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you a 12-year-old girl?

33:16.975 --> 33:17.215
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

33:17.495 --> 33:17.895
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

33:18.075 --> 33:19.596
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think 12-year-old girls will like the show?

33:20.957 --> 33:22.218
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea.

33:23.577 --> 33:25.459
[SPEAKER_03]: Banda in our chatroom says, fuck Dance Fever.

33:26.740 --> 33:27.260
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you too.

33:27.700 --> 33:27.941
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

33:28.221 --> 33:29.302
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else on your mind, buddy?

33:30.042 --> 33:39.809
[SPEAKER_24]: I wanted to say some other things, but I have here in my hands a 22-ounce ounce of Guinness, and I'm about to open it up, and I'm having a toast here for you guys.

33:40.430 --> 33:41.230
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.

33:41.491 --> 33:42.151
[SPEAKER_03]: A toast to you.

33:42.912 --> 33:43.532
[SPEAKER_24]: Here's to you.

33:43.772 --> 33:44.373
[SPEAKER_24]: Here's to me.

33:44.433 --> 33:45.714
[SPEAKER_24]: The best of friends we will be.

33:45.874 --> 33:48.736
[SPEAKER_24]: But if we should ever happen to agree, well, fuck you, and here's to me.

33:48.756 --> 33:49.777
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm down on this bitch right now.

33:51.443 --> 33:53.064
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy that Guinness, motherfucker.

33:53.084 --> 33:53.924
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll see you in October.

33:54.524 --> 33:55.304
[SPEAKER_03]: Got that shit right.

33:55.464 --> 33:55.765
[SPEAKER_03]: Later.

33:58.986 --> 34:00.266
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to one of our old favorites.

34:00.286 --> 34:01.907
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been making the poor bastard wait all night.

34:02.327 --> 34:03.447
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

34:03.467 --> 34:03.887
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

34:04.848 --> 34:06.208
[SPEAKER_26]: One and only Legend of Zaku.

34:06.608 --> 34:08.349
[SPEAKER_26]: What's on your mind, Mr. Zaku?

34:09.145 --> 34:12.086
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, by just, you know, 200 episodes, man.

34:12.106 --> 34:16.107
[SPEAKER_26]: That's a feat right there that you can't accomplish without effort.

34:16.307 --> 34:21.968
[SPEAKER_03]: It wouldn't be a 200th episode without our 200 minutes worth of phone calls caller here, Zaku.

34:22.228 --> 34:22.628
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

34:23.228 --> 34:24.149
[SPEAKER_03]: Digital Life's coming up.

34:24.169 --> 34:24.609
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you excited?

34:24.629 --> 34:25.969
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to go see Final Fantasy XII?

34:26.689 --> 34:29.190
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, that and I'm trying to pick out a freestyle routine.

34:29.230 --> 34:31.570
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm trying to pick out a song, most importantly.

34:31.831 --> 34:34.791
[SPEAKER_26]: I kind of have a case of freestyler's block at the moment.

34:34.811 --> 34:36.512
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, are you going to come visit me in October?

34:36.532 --> 34:37.392
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm coming to New York.

34:37.412 --> 34:37.652
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm

34:38.357 --> 34:38.577
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet.

34:38.597 --> 34:39.237
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, most likely.

34:39.398 --> 34:39.878
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.

34:40.038 --> 34:42.859
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll even give you the stuff that I'm a snag from Digital Life.

34:43.119 --> 34:44.480
[SPEAKER_03]: You gonna give us another signed poster?

34:44.500 --> 34:45.400
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that was pretty badass.

34:45.420 --> 34:46.741
[SPEAKER_03]: You got us the signed Indie Geek poster.

34:46.761 --> 34:49.842
[SPEAKER_26]: That depends if Rocks or Red Octane has something set up.

34:50.163 --> 34:50.903
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll take anything.

34:50.923 --> 34:51.703
[SPEAKER_03]: We like free things.

34:52.524 --> 34:53.264
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, alright then.

34:55.205 --> 34:57.786
[SPEAKER_26]: You know Supernova's patch came out last week, right?

34:57.886 --> 34:58.366
[SPEAKER_26]: That's right.

34:58.406 --> 35:00.147
[SPEAKER_26]: We have a patch and there's a new song in it, right?

35:00.167 --> 35:00.828
[SPEAKER_26]: Some type of remix?

35:01.508 --> 35:03.489
[SPEAKER_26]: Fascination Eternal Love Remix.

35:03.529 --> 35:04.129
[SPEAKER_26]: Should be fun.

35:04.169 --> 35:04.429
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

35:04.689 --> 35:05.130
[SPEAKER_03]: Should be fun.

35:06.534 --> 35:21.346
[SPEAKER_26]: It's basically a remix of Fascination Max, but with the sounds that you get from opening a door in a car, the little ringing sound, and just a lot of phone ringing right there.

35:22.867 --> 35:24.409
[SPEAKER_26]: I think you have the video up there on your site.

35:25.630 --> 35:25.950
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

35:28.352 --> 35:34.357
[SPEAKER_26]: Anyways, the last thing, I don't get how Nintendo flip-flops on what they say.

35:35.228 --> 35:41.111
[SPEAKER_26]: On one side, they said that it was going to be region-free, but on the other, they act as if it didn't exist.

35:41.131 --> 35:42.032
[SPEAKER_26]: They end up denying it.

35:42.292 --> 35:44.373
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone hasn't made a final decision on it.

35:45.134 --> 35:47.315
[SPEAKER_03]: The left hand's not talking to the right hand.

35:47.335 --> 35:49.917
[SPEAKER_26]: That's exactly what's going on.

35:49.957 --> 35:52.298
[SPEAKER_26]: Happens in corporate America all the time.

35:52.318 --> 36:03.024
[SPEAKER_26]: I was pretty excited on Thursday when I heard all these wonderful fairy tales about the Wii, and then all of a sudden, we have this little black eye that came days later.

36:03.725 --> 36:04.325
[SPEAKER_26]: That could have...

36:05.106 --> 36:07.306
[SPEAKER_26]: Was the news the end of the world, though, Zaku?

36:08.927 --> 36:11.307
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, you know what?

36:11.387 --> 36:13.467
[SPEAKER_26]: Screw the Wii and PS3.

36:13.848 --> 36:15.308
[SPEAKER_26]: It's all about Happy Sky CS.

36:15.428 --> 36:15.788
[SPEAKER_26]: That's it.

36:16.928 --> 36:19.789
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm focusing all my energy on something besides the hype.

36:19.869 --> 36:21.489
[SPEAKER_03]: Beatmania is the only game you need, huh?

36:22.269 --> 36:23.049
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, pretty much.

36:23.129 --> 36:23.449
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

36:23.569 --> 36:23.989
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds fair.

36:24.049 --> 36:25.109
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to let you go, Zaku.

36:25.129 --> 36:25.690
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got more calls.

36:25.750 --> 36:26.350
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

36:26.390 --> 36:26.790
[SPEAKER_03]: Later, buddy.

36:27.390 --> 36:27.630
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace.

36:28.650 --> 36:29.010
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

36:29.370 --> 36:30.390
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's one more call.

36:30.430 --> 36:30.850
[SPEAKER_03]: He's coming in.

36:31.391 --> 36:32.931
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on... Oops, did I pick this up?

36:33.371 --> 36:33.771
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I did.

36:34.369 --> 36:35.709
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

36:35.729 --> 36:36.169
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

36:36.790 --> 36:37.950
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, it's Arcadian42.

36:38.310 --> 36:40.791
[SPEAKER_03]: Arcadian42, what's on your mind?

36:40.811 --> 36:47.412
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to call in because I haven't listened in a while and had a connection from the first show since I think I was there.

36:47.773 --> 36:48.753
[SPEAKER_08]: Or at least one of the first shows.

36:48.933 --> 36:54.694
[SPEAKER_03]: You were there on the first show and this is the most we've ever heard from you in like 200 episodes worth of shows.

36:55.875 --> 36:56.795
[SPEAKER_08]: You might have heard a little bit more.

36:57.015 --> 36:57.615
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I know.

36:57.695 --> 36:59.656
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate your support over the years, Arcadian42.

36:59.676 --> 36:59.756
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

37:01.728 --> 37:07.491
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been less recently since I've been playing too many video games What do you think of the Wii?

37:08.592 --> 37:19.839
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like it'll be interesting I haven't really been following the news but since I might have money soon I might actually be able to buy one Awesome Is that the system of choice amongst the three?

37:20.839 --> 37:27.403
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know I'll have to see what I want Alright, sounds good Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

37:28.828 --> 37:29.248
[SPEAKER_08]: Not really.

37:30.108 --> 37:31.989
[SPEAKER_08]: Just congratulations on your 200 episodes.

37:32.529 --> 37:34.669
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I'll see you and come to a future show.

37:34.829 --> 37:35.890
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, anytime.

37:35.910 --> 37:36.930
[SPEAKER_03]: The door's open to you anytime.

37:38.150 --> 37:38.450
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

37:38.530 --> 37:39.190
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

37:39.210 --> 37:39.750
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

37:39.770 --> 37:43.871
[SPEAKER_03]: It really means a lot to us that we have folks that remember us all the way from episode one still calling in.

37:43.931 --> 37:45.452
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you've been a long time supporter of the show.

37:45.772 --> 37:46.932
[SPEAKER_03]: We really appreciate it, my friend.

37:47.712 --> 37:47.992
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

37:48.212 --> 37:49.092
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, have a good one, buddy.

37:49.612 --> 37:49.912
[SPEAKER_14]: You too.

37:50.112 --> 37:50.393
[SPEAKER_03]: Later.

37:51.773 --> 37:53.933
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots and lots of good... Let's do at least one more call here.

37:53.993 --> 37:55.214
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

37:55.254 --> 37:55.674
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

37:56.874 --> 37:57.454
[SPEAKER_07]: AJ Twist.

37:57.887 --> 37:58.647
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, what's on your mind?

38:00.168 --> 38:02.788
[SPEAKER_07]: Just calling in to say happy 200th birthday.

38:03.088 --> 38:03.388
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

38:03.408 --> 38:07.590
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, practically it.

38:07.890 --> 38:08.810
[SPEAKER_07]: Seeing how you guys are.

38:08.830 --> 38:12.111
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, I wanted to talk to DarkSakura about Tekken VR.

38:12.491 --> 38:12.771
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

38:14.891 --> 38:15.572
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura?

38:16.272 --> 38:16.892
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes?

38:17.932 --> 38:19.333
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you liking the game?

38:20.833 --> 38:24.894
[SPEAKER_21]: I have to say that I like it a whole lot because I'm just such an uber Tekken fangirl that

38:25.914 --> 38:28.815
[SPEAKER_21]: It's all about... Though I always play with Jin every time.

38:29.435 --> 38:30.216
[SPEAKER_21]: But it's really fun.

38:30.236 --> 38:32.257
[SPEAKER_21]: I like that you have so many different characters to choose from.

38:33.177 --> 38:33.657
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty cool.

38:33.677 --> 38:40.160
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you remember my letter I wrote in two, three, four months ago, maybe.

38:41.240 --> 38:42.300
[SPEAKER_07]: I wrote to Pink Yoshi.

38:44.201 --> 38:48.423
[SPEAKER_03]: I think... I seem to recall a handle named Pink Yoshi because I'm sure I would have made fun of it.

38:49.443 --> 38:50.264
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, you did.

38:50.284 --> 38:51.024
[SPEAKER_07]: I see.

38:52.805 --> 38:53.785
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing personal, my friend.

38:54.794 --> 38:55.495
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's all good.

38:56.315 --> 39:01.499
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I'm still up for some good matches with you, DarkSakura, Tekken.

39:01.839 --> 39:03.841
[SPEAKER_07]: Someday, sometime.

39:04.421 --> 39:04.881
[SPEAKER_21]: Sometime.

39:04.962 --> 39:09.905
[SPEAKER_21]: Right now it's been kind of crazy busy, but I'm working on trying to set some time aside.

39:10.025 --> 39:16.870
[SPEAKER_21]: If I can ever wrestle the PSP away from Dan, except he's been... I'll have to take it when he's distracted with pinball.

39:17.230 --> 39:20.152
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys will have to set up some time on the Orange Ones Radio message forums.

39:20.793 --> 39:23.595
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, send me a message on the forums and we'll see about setting something up.

39:24.502 --> 39:25.483
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you aware of the ghost system?

39:26.464 --> 39:26.644
[SPEAKER_21]: Huh?

39:27.304 --> 39:27.585
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry?

39:27.605 --> 39:28.826
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you aware of the ghost system?

39:29.646 --> 39:30.267
[SPEAKER_21]: No, actually.

39:31.468 --> 39:41.336
[SPEAKER_07]: If you play through the dojo, eventually you can unlock the ghost system which records your character as you play and act as your ghost and you can play that.

39:41.896 --> 39:43.277
[SPEAKER_07]: Other players can play that online.

39:43.698 --> 39:44.358
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, that's pretty cool.

39:44.398 --> 39:44.959
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of neat.

39:45.299 --> 39:47.661
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll have to do that then.

39:47.761 --> 39:54.166
[SPEAKER_07]: Once you get that ghost, maybe you can somehow rip it out of the ESP and online send it over to me and I'll send you my ghost.

39:56.075 --> 39:56.816
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, that's kind of neat.

39:56.836 --> 39:57.916
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish they did that for Mario Kart.

39:57.936 --> 39:59.618
[SPEAKER_21]: I have to set some time aside.

40:00.679 --> 40:02.840
[SPEAKER_07]: Check out Tekken, if I may plug in the site.

40:03.060 --> 40:05.703
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that all right?

40:05.723 --> 40:06.243
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I missed that.

40:06.283 --> 40:06.763
[SPEAKER_03]: Tekken what?

40:07.824 --> 40:08.765
[SPEAKER_07]: Tekken Zaibatsu.

40:09.365 --> 40:10.306
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, Tekken Zaibatsu?

40:11.227 --> 40:13.829
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they have a little form on that, too.

40:14.089 --> 40:19.773
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, yeah, I used to go to that site all the time to get all the pictures and everything from the official Namco art.

40:20.914 --> 40:21.555
[SPEAKER_21]: I haven't been to that.

40:21.575 --> 40:23.556
[SPEAKER_21]: I actually haven't been to that site in easily a year.

40:23.596 --> 40:24.277
[SPEAKER_21]: I forgot about it.

40:25.709 --> 40:27.871
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it hasn't been too big lately.

40:27.891 --> 40:29.152
[SPEAKER_07]: Not much going on.

40:29.552 --> 40:30.192
[SPEAKER_21]: No, that's a cool site.

40:30.212 --> 40:30.973
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll have to check out the forum.

40:31.233 --> 40:31.493
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks.

40:32.494 --> 40:33.054
[SPEAKER_07]: No problem.

40:33.234 --> 40:34.095
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, any other thoughts?

40:34.475 --> 40:35.476
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, oh, Loki?

40:36.836 --> 40:37.057
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?

40:37.877 --> 40:41.620
[SPEAKER_07]: A question about the PSP on hacking it, since you're big on that.

40:42.560 --> 40:42.880
[SPEAKER_03]: What now?

40:43.541 --> 40:44.641
[SPEAKER_03]: A question on the PSP hacking.

40:44.761 --> 40:44.982
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

40:46.322 --> 40:50.005
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know any cool type of media players that can play playlists?

40:50.945 --> 40:51.446
[SPEAKER_29]: Hmm.

40:52.671 --> 40:54.352
[SPEAKER_29]: I can play playlists.

40:54.392 --> 40:59.875
[SPEAKER_29]: I know they had some stuff where you can stream like playlists from your PC.

41:00.735 --> 41:02.116
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know that one too.

41:02.376 --> 41:03.597
[SPEAKER_29]: What's the website you always use?

41:03.617 --> 41:04.697
[SPEAKER_29]: PSP Updates or something?

41:04.717 --> 41:06.018
[SPEAKER_29]: PSP Updates has a lot of stuff on there.

41:06.318 --> 41:06.658
[SPEAKER_03]: Check it out.

41:06.678 --> 41:08.019
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'll go check around there more.

41:08.419 --> 41:09.200
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

41:09.220 --> 41:09.780
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks anyways.

41:10.240 --> 41:12.301
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we gotta let you go, my friend.

41:12.321 --> 41:14.442
[SPEAKER_03]: We got some more calls to get through and then we're gonna end the show.

41:15.383 --> 41:18.244
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, happy 200th episode again and have a good night.

41:18.664 --> 41:18.905
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

41:19.265 --> 41:19.825
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one, buddy.

41:21.426 --> 41:21.666
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye-bye.

41:23.110 --> 41:24.891
[SPEAKER_03]: This number has been trying to hammer us for a little bit now.

41:25.491 --> 41:27.052
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

41:27.072 --> 41:27.412
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

41:28.313 --> 41:28.833
[SPEAKER_03]: I made it.

41:29.214 --> 41:29.454
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

41:29.514 --> 41:29.774
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa.

41:29.834 --> 41:30.054
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

41:30.114 --> 41:30.514
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

41:31.495 --> 41:32.055
[SPEAKER_03]: It's DT.

41:32.856 --> 41:33.436
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, DT.

41:33.476 --> 41:34.237
[SPEAKER_11]: What's on your mind?

41:35.358 --> 41:39.240
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been trying to call in ever since the segment opened.

41:39.621 --> 41:39.881
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

41:39.901 --> 41:41.061
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been hammered tonight.

41:41.122 --> 41:41.862
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.

41:41.902 --> 41:42.823
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind, my friend?

41:45.104 --> 41:47.206
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to wish you guys a happy 200th.

41:47.866 --> 41:48.627
[SPEAKER_03]: Appreciate it.

41:48.647 --> 41:50.688
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been with us since episode one, right?

41:51.318 --> 41:52.479
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, absolutely.

41:54.139 --> 41:56.600
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what do you think about the Wii news?

41:56.620 --> 41:57.721
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to be picking up a Wii?

41:58.821 --> 42:00.442
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll probably get one for Christmas.

42:01.602 --> 42:03.163
[SPEAKER_21]: What games in particular are you looking forward to?

42:08.325 --> 42:09.646
[SPEAKER_11]: Red Steel looks kind of cool.

42:10.666 --> 42:11.427
[SPEAKER_27]: Not Smash Bros.

42:11.447 --> 42:11.767
[SPEAKER_27]: Brawl?

42:12.367 --> 42:13.568
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh yeah.

42:14.208 --> 42:15.208
[SPEAKER_27]: You're pumped up for that, right?

42:16.269 --> 42:16.629
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh yeah.

42:17.620 --> 42:23.764
[SPEAKER_21]: So actually speaking of Unsmashed Brothers of Ballroom, are there any other characters that you wanted to see in it, either Konami or Nintendo?

42:25.806 --> 42:29.509
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I was kind of hoping Lolo and Lala would be in it.

42:30.029 --> 42:30.609
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, wow.

42:31.750 --> 42:32.751
[SPEAKER_27]: They're HAL characters?

42:32.771 --> 42:33.471
[SPEAKER_21]: Lolo and Lala.

42:33.732 --> 42:35.393
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh my god, that is old school.

42:36.634 --> 42:39.356
[SPEAKER_21]: What would they do, turn duels over?

42:39.456 --> 42:42.057
[SPEAKER_27]: They would turn your character into eggs and then push boxes at you.

42:42.678 --> 42:43.298
[SPEAKER_27]: There you go.

42:43.639 --> 42:44.699
[SPEAKER_27]: Way old school.

42:46.806 --> 42:47.487
[SPEAKER_14]: That's pretty cool.

42:47.987 --> 42:50.509
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, DT, I know you've been supporting us since episode one.

42:50.549 --> 42:52.050
[SPEAKER_03]: We really, really appreciate it.

42:52.350 --> 42:56.394
[SPEAKER_03]: Your enthusiasm for this station has been wonderful, and I know you work for our site now, and we love having you on board.

42:56.894 --> 42:57.915
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks so much for calling in.

42:58.135 --> 42:58.615
[SPEAKER_03]: Anytime.

42:58.876 --> 42:59.756
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, have a good one, my friend.

43:00.757 --> 43:01.157
[SPEAKER_03]: You too.

43:01.317 --> 43:01.678
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye-bye.

43:01.758 --> 43:03.119
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have to play DDR together someday.

43:03.319 --> 43:04.820
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen him in a while.

43:04.860 --> 43:05.461
[SPEAKER_03]: He's local.

43:05.541 --> 43:06.602
[SPEAKER_03]: We, like, never see each other.

43:06.802 --> 43:07.522
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.

43:08.703 --> 43:11.846
[SPEAKER_03]: DT, DarkSakura, he, like, lives just around the corner, practically.

43:11.866 --> 43:12.406
[SPEAKER_03]: We never see him.

43:12.666 --> 43:13.247
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of sad.

43:14.608 --> 43:15.008
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

43:15.028 --> 43:15.869
[SPEAKER_21]: I see him at Dan's store.

43:16.950 --> 43:19.132
[SPEAKER_21]: I randomly run into him at Dan's GameStop.

43:19.332 --> 43:20.954
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you guys so much for calling.

43:20.974 --> 43:21.795
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we got one more.

43:21.815 --> 43:22.435
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll make this real quick.

43:23.076 --> 43:23.876
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

43:23.896 --> 43:24.197
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

43:27.439 --> 43:27.760
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.

43:27.820 --> 43:28.801
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind, Actdeft?

43:29.741 --> 43:30.302
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotta be quick.

43:30.362 --> 43:30.562
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh!

43:30.582 --> 43:31.022
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

43:31.042 --> 43:32.844
[SPEAKER_23]: What's on your mind?

43:32.864 --> 43:33.104
[SPEAKER_23]: I agree.

43:33.124 --> 43:34.706
[SPEAKER_23]: The Wii is gonna be awesome.

43:45.037 --> 43:46.578
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you so much for calling in.

43:46.598 --> 43:48.600
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to keep it short, though, because we've got to get to our next segment.

43:48.620 --> 43:50.521
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome to hear from people outside of the U.S.

43:50.601 --> 43:51.002
[SPEAKER_03]: once in a while.

43:51.022 --> 43:53.043
[SPEAKER_03]: We love hearing from Canada, Mexico, U.K.

43:53.083 --> 43:53.444
[SPEAKER_03]: We love it.

43:56.026 --> 43:56.506
[SPEAKER_03]: Is he still there?

43:56.686 --> 43:56.986
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello?

43:58.167 --> 43:58.928
[SPEAKER_03]: There must be a delay.

43:59.668 --> 44:00.269
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he hung up.

44:00.589 --> 44:00.829
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well.

44:01.770 --> 44:01.990
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well.

44:02.010 --> 44:02.471
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you.

44:02.651 --> 44:03.371
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for calling.

44:03.491 --> 44:03.752
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

44:03.812 --> 44:06.073
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the first call from Mexico we've gotten.

44:06.474 --> 44:06.854
[SPEAKER_21]: I think so.

44:06.994 --> 44:07.535
[SPEAKER_03]: How sweet.

44:08.075 --> 44:08.335
[SPEAKER_21]: Cool.

44:08.355 --> 44:08.836
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

44:08.856 --> 44:08.936
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

44:09.756 --> 44:10.817
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go to Cabo someday.

44:10.897 --> 44:12.338
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never been to Mexico, but I want to go to Cabo.

44:12.478 --> 44:13.559
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to go to Tijuana.

44:14.100 --> 44:14.420
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

44:15.773 --> 44:16.753
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do this now.

44:17.254 --> 44:18.575
[SPEAKER_03]: I warned you this would be a little bit random.

44:19.295 --> 44:31.804
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to bring back a segment that you guys who listen to the old show know and those of you guys who joined us in the podcast maybe have never heard this segment before but it's been known to get a little bit weird and a little bit random and a little bit questiony.

44:32.304 --> 44:34.966
[SPEAKER_03]: It's this old segment called Ask Orange Lounge.

44:41.130 --> 44:42.411
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's Ask Orange Lounge.

44:42.939 --> 44:44.080
[SPEAKER_03]: Some stupid question.

44:44.560 --> 44:47.822
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

44:48.243 --> 44:55.248
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure it's going to be interesting because we haven't allowed this segment on in over a year because the questions have been lame.

44:59.030 --> 45:01.592
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's see what you guys have pent up over the past year.

45:03.874 --> 45:06.375
[SPEAKER_03]: DMN wants to know, oh, I'm sorry, let's see.

45:06.796 --> 45:10.318
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the most fun thing and the most frustrating thing about doing Orange Lounge Radio?

45:11.701 --> 45:16.202
[SPEAKER_21]: The most fun thing is having my ego grow.

45:17.362 --> 45:19.903
[SPEAKER_21]: And the most frustrating thing is this room.

45:21.003 --> 45:21.823
[SPEAKER_21]: With the door shut.

45:22.824 --> 45:26.744
[SPEAKER_29]: It does get quite hot in here.

45:28.225 --> 45:28.765
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know.

45:31.165 --> 45:32.946
[SPEAKER_29]: Just trying to stay on top of the news.

45:33.306 --> 45:34.826
[SPEAKER_29]: It's kind of tough during the week.

45:35.146 --> 45:38.247
[SPEAKER_29]: Remembering to update my show rules.

45:39.399 --> 45:42.822
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say the most fun thing about Orange Launch Radio... Oh, it's so much fun.

45:43.282 --> 45:51.028
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's getting that instant feedback of having people, whether it be DarkSakura or Loki, right here in my ear, or having the chat room there.

45:51.128 --> 45:54.790
[SPEAKER_03]: I think having that feedback on your opinions is really great and kind of neat.

45:55.091 --> 45:58.353
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it's just the reward I get from it is instant gratification.

45:58.393 --> 45:59.974
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm a typical male.

46:00.615 --> 46:03.637
[SPEAKER_03]: The most frustrating thing about doing Orange Launch Radio is losing my Sunday nights.

46:04.609 --> 46:08.611
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, as much as I enjoy hanging out, but it's tough because it means you only really get a one-day weekend.

46:08.951 --> 46:10.292
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so that's been frustrating.

46:10.352 --> 46:13.214
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I don't know, I guess you're just used to it after 200 weeks now, right?

46:14.074 --> 46:14.834
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I feel.

46:15.055 --> 46:15.335
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

46:15.355 --> 46:16.135
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just kind of used to it.

46:16.955 --> 46:23.299
[SPEAKER_21]: I have fully timed it, you know, how long I have to leave the South Bay now to get here.

46:23.519 --> 46:29.262
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys, since we have about at least 20 people who have submitted questions tonight, we can't get all your questions in, so we apologize.

46:29.622 --> 46:32.864
[SPEAKER_03]: The things that are a little too random and weird, we may not be able to get to tonight.

46:32.904 --> 46:33.484
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize.

46:34.808 --> 46:38.670
[SPEAKER_03]: OL Army Eddie wants to know, where can I get all these cool songs you play?

46:39.130 --> 46:39.851
[SPEAKER_03]: The internet.

46:40.991 --> 46:42.792
[SPEAKER_21]: The internet is not just for porn.

46:42.812 --> 46:43.232
[SPEAKER_03]: iTunes.

46:44.973 --> 46:47.154
[SPEAKER_03]: If you ever want to know, try asking in chat.

46:47.434 --> 46:48.955
[SPEAKER_03]: Try emailing one of us.

46:49.615 --> 46:56.379
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing is that when you guys ask during the show, sometimes we're so busy operating the behind-the-scenes stuff that we can't answer questions right away.

46:56.779 --> 46:58.700
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you can come a few bars, we'll tell you.

46:59.460 --> 47:00.361
[SPEAKER_03]: You can always send us an email.

47:00.721 --> 47:02.341
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm more than fine with sharing song titles and things.

47:02.361 --> 47:02.862
[SPEAKER_13]: You can send me an email.

47:03.222 --> 47:03.362
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

47:05.680 --> 47:09.603
[SPEAKER_03]: R Also, he wants to know, I guess I'll go ahead and entertain this question.

47:09.943 --> 47:11.644
[SPEAKER_03]: What would cause Sky to go straight?

47:11.824 --> 47:12.945
[SPEAKER_03]: Be graphic if needed.

47:14.145 --> 47:14.846
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing my tits.

47:15.166 --> 47:15.987
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that, Chris?

47:16.747 --> 47:17.588
[SPEAKER_19]: Seeing my tits.

47:18.228 --> 47:19.189
[SPEAKER_03]: That might be a good start.

47:19.929 --> 47:25.953
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say one hot night with Gina Grishan or Beyonce.

47:25.993 --> 47:27.234
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why I love Beyonce.

47:27.254 --> 47:27.954
[SPEAKER_03]: She's so hot.

47:28.174 --> 47:28.775
[SPEAKER_03]: She's really hot.

47:30.035 --> 47:30.616
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't know.

47:31.076 --> 47:32.577
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I'd

47:33.018 --> 47:35.759
[SPEAKER_03]: Boobs and Punaner just don't do it for me.

47:35.919 --> 47:36.359
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

47:36.379 --> 47:41.080
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sure you appreciate the aesthetic value of boobs.

47:41.200 --> 47:44.441
[SPEAKER_03]: I ask the women out there, do boobs and Punaner do it for you?

47:45.041 --> 47:51.003
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I know this is probably not the best room to ask this question, but I'm asking the other women out there.

47:51.303 --> 47:52.263
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I feel.

47:52.644 --> 47:57.505
[SPEAKER_03]: And guys out there, if you're a straight man, does penis do it for you?

47:58.462 --> 47:59.802
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you like the cock?

47:59.902 --> 48:02.363
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's how I feel about boobs and punaner.

48:02.543 --> 48:03.263
[SPEAKER_21]: Are you gay?

48:03.703 --> 48:05.283
[SPEAKER_21]: If you scream phone call, you gay.

48:07.344 --> 48:09.704
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft wants to know, can you speak Spanish?

48:11.605 --> 48:14.045
[SPEAKER_03]: Uno pequeño de español, si.

48:15.005 --> 48:16.166
[SPEAKER_19]: Unos zapatos aquí.

48:17.346 --> 48:23.387
[SPEAKER_03]: I had two years of Spanish, or dos años de español en colegio, but I'm not very good at it.

48:23.427 --> 48:24.887
[SPEAKER_03]: I only remember a few words here and there.

48:25.167 --> 48:26.648
[SPEAKER_21]: El teléfono es en fuego.

48:29.593 --> 48:35.918
[SPEAKER_21]: I took French and Japanese, so I can also say the TV is on fire.

48:36.598 --> 48:39.000
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft also wants to know, what's your opinion on Mexican zoning?

48:39.040 --> 48:39.500
[SPEAKER_03]: Pump it up.

48:41.181 --> 48:41.782
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing wrong with that.

48:42.002 --> 48:42.682
[SPEAKER_22]: That's pretty hot.

48:42.762 --> 48:43.943
[SPEAKER_03]: More games for everyone.

48:43.983 --> 48:44.583
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good thing.

48:45.364 --> 48:46.164
[SPEAKER_03]: No problems there.

48:46.505 --> 48:50.227
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless the country actually bought the game.

48:50.287 --> 48:51.668
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

48:53.249 --> 48:57.232
[SPEAKER_03]: Blackwolf says, how can you type with boxing gloves on your hands?

49:01.049 --> 49:01.289
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

49:01.610 --> 49:03.030
[SPEAKER_03]: A very large keyboard.

49:07.793 --> 49:10.294
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn you people that bring Homestar Runner into this show.

49:10.554 --> 49:12.355
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I love Homestar Runner.

49:12.395 --> 49:14.596
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't complain, but you guys are funny.

49:17.157 --> 49:17.837
[SPEAKER_03]: Checking the PMs.

49:17.857 --> 49:18.358
[SPEAKER_03]: Checking the PMs.

49:19.358 --> 49:19.998
[SPEAKER_13]: Email!

49:20.178 --> 49:26.521
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTetsuya wants to know, so what's it like going from reporting on hypodermic needles in Solo 2000 to the Nintendo Wii?

49:26.541 --> 49:27.502
[SPEAKER_03]: Nostalgia!

49:28.049 --> 49:28.929
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, nostalgia.

49:28.949 --> 49:31.370
[SPEAKER_21]: That was one of our first beat-ups.

49:31.730 --> 49:33.311
[SPEAKER_21]: I remember calling that arcade.

49:33.911 --> 49:35.532
[SPEAKER_21]: I said, oh, you'll have to talk to our manager.

49:35.552 --> 49:36.592
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that, too.

49:37.032 --> 49:38.072
[SPEAKER_03]: We were pretty cutting out.

49:38.092 --> 49:41.414
[SPEAKER_21]: That was when I was sleeping in the Harry Potter room in the gay frat house.

49:42.274 --> 49:42.974
[SPEAKER_03]: That was awesome.

49:44.094 --> 49:44.635
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

49:44.695 --> 49:51.517
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, we were... I remember doing the recording a podcast while... No, not even a podcast.

49:51.537 --> 49:54.638
[SPEAKER_21]: We were recording a live show while I was playing Beatmania.

49:54.738 --> 49:57.439
[SPEAKER_21]: And they were trying to talk to me like, I'm trying to play 321 Stars, damn it!

49:58.527 --> 50:02.290
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's just been crazy.

50:02.430 --> 50:05.892
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been a lot of... It's funny how games have changed in the past four years.

50:06.133 --> 50:08.754
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when we started doing this show, Max 2 was new in the arcades.

50:09.255 --> 50:11.977
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we went through Extreme, we went through a drought, now we're into Supernova.

50:13.718 --> 50:14.579
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, more songs.

50:15.699 --> 50:17.221
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to get out of here before midnight tonight.

50:17.621 --> 50:20.003
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68 wants to know, do any of you play O2 Jam?

50:20.563 --> 50:25.246
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried it out about six months ago, and I had a pretty good time with it, I just haven't been back.

50:25.907 --> 50:27.388
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't do well with the game's

50:30.176 --> 50:30.497
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

50:31.317 --> 50:34.599
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just not good at checking in regularly with games like that for some reason.

50:34.979 --> 50:39.462
[SPEAKER_03]: I did play recently a game that somewhat reminded me of it, though, which was the R2-B, which was kind of fun.

50:40.103 --> 50:42.004
[SPEAKER_03]: I should check it out again and see what's changed there.

50:42.284 --> 50:43.224
[SPEAKER_03]: Has anyone else played O2 Jam?

50:43.965 --> 50:44.065
[SPEAKER_03]: No?

50:44.285 --> 50:44.465
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes?

50:44.605 --> 50:44.705
[SPEAKER_03]: No?

50:45.166 --> 50:47.947
[SPEAKER_21]: I looked at E3 and then walked on.

50:48.728 --> 50:48.948
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

50:50.170 --> 50:50.691
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

50:52.131 --> 50:56.453
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendomaniac64 wants to know, Could I race Loki in Mario Kart DS?

50:56.513 --> 50:59.655
[SPEAKER_03]: I never got the chance and I've gone anti-snaking since nine months ago.

51:01.916 --> 51:03.537
[SPEAKER_21]: That sounds like a 12-step program.

51:03.557 --> 51:06.438
[SPEAKER_29]: I literally dusted off Mario Kart DS today.

51:07.339 --> 51:09.920
[SPEAKER_29]: I haven't played that game in months.

51:10.640 --> 51:10.920
[SPEAKER_29]: Alright.

51:13.362 --> 51:24.564
[SPEAKER_03]: Bandit wants to know, if train A is traveling at 50 miles per hour from Pittsburgh and train B is traveling at 35 miles per hour from California, which state will they meet in order to resupply the Orange Lounge Radio with more Chocobo Nuggets?

51:25.204 --> 51:25.464
Wisconsin!

51:26.084 --> 51:27.124
[SPEAKER_03]: African or European?

51:29.105 --> 51:29.765
[SPEAKER_03]: African.

51:32.065 --> 51:36.506
[SPEAKER_03]: Nazgul Slayer wants to know, question, is there a Castro District ghetto?

51:37.326 --> 51:37.626
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

51:38.747 --> 51:40.207
[SPEAKER_03]: How about the whole place is ghetto?

51:40.227 --> 51:40.267
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

51:41.448 --> 51:44.591
[SPEAKER_21]: I actually feel safer there than just about any other place in San Francisco.

51:44.611 --> 51:47.273
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, actually, if you go around San Francisco, it's the safest place I feel.

51:47.293 --> 51:49.615
[SPEAKER_21]: Except for the homeless man who was laying with his cock out.

51:50.996 --> 51:59.623
[SPEAKER_19]: Around for your birthday, we found something in the window, and it's about that big around, and it's a penis, and we're going to catch you for your birthday.

51:59.703 --> 52:01.905
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to chase you around the house with it.

52:02.025 --> 52:04.407
[SPEAKER_21]: We also found you a codless bodysuit.

52:05.748 --> 52:06.649
[SPEAKER_03]: That's disgusting.

52:08.737 --> 52:12.520
[SPEAKER_03]: Ramma wants to know, you need to talk about the Spanish DDR movie.

52:13.941 --> 52:14.801
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, that's right.

52:14.841 --> 52:15.982
[SPEAKER_21]: I watched the trailer for that.

52:16.002 --> 52:17.323
[SPEAKER_03]: La Machina de Balar.

52:18.124 --> 52:19.124
[SPEAKER_21]: It actually looks kind of funny.

52:19.344 --> 52:21.346
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see the actual movie before I talk about it.

52:21.366 --> 52:23.007
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, trailers can be deceiving, right?

52:23.327 --> 52:24.128
[SPEAKER_21]: The trailer looked funny.

52:24.408 --> 52:24.668
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

52:25.068 --> 52:29.571
[SPEAKER_03]: Poto wants to know, Dear Orange Laundry, if you had to be a species of bird, extinct or not, which would you be?

52:29.591 --> 52:31.372
[SPEAKER_03]: Dodo.

52:31.412 --> 52:33.414
[SPEAKER_03]: The Dodo, I'm hearing Drew and Chris say.

52:33.434 --> 52:33.794
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?

52:34.401 --> 52:36.361
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be a... You'd be a fucking parrot.

52:38.262 --> 52:44.923
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd be a pterodactyl.

52:45.723 --> 52:46.623
[SPEAKER_21]: What is that bird?

52:46.904 --> 52:50.384
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not a parrot, it's another bird that lives as long as a human does.

52:50.404 --> 52:52.005
[SPEAKER_21]: Chicken?

52:52.065 --> 52:52.885
[SPEAKER_21]: No, not chicken.

52:55.345 --> 52:56.926
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be Toucan Sam.

52:58.646 --> 53:03.907
[SPEAKER_21]: But I don't remember exactly what type of bird it is, but it's a bird that lives as long as a human and it's actually very intelligent.

53:04.742 --> 53:05.282
[SPEAKER_21]: No, not a vulture.

53:05.502 --> 53:06.523
[SPEAKER_21]: Ooh, I'd be a vulture.

53:07.243 --> 53:08.924
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I'd be a raven because I'm all goth.

53:09.484 --> 53:09.965
[SPEAKER_21]: Nevermore.

53:10.565 --> 53:11.705
[SPEAKER_27]: What about the Norwegian blue?

53:11.805 --> 53:12.706
[SPEAKER_27]: Lovely plumage.

53:12.886 --> 53:13.946
Lovely plumage.

53:14.587 --> 53:14.867
[SPEAKER_27]: All right.

53:14.907 --> 53:16.168
[SPEAKER_21]: He's pining for the fjords.

53:16.648 --> 53:17.808
[SPEAKER_21]: He's not pining.

53:17.828 --> 53:20.310
[SPEAKER_21]: He's fast on.

53:21.010 --> 53:22.591
[SPEAKER_21]: This is an expert.

53:24.271 --> 53:26.252
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to the next question here.

53:26.673 --> 53:29.434
[SPEAKER_03]: Socorina wants to know, do you guys have VJ Army accounts?

53:29.474 --> 53:30.815
[SPEAKER_03]: And if so, what's your DJ name?

53:31.675 --> 53:33.856
[SPEAKER_21]: I do have one and I haven't ever updated it.

53:34.790 --> 53:35.510
[SPEAKER_21]: 8th 8th Loki

54:01.226 --> 54:01.647
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know.

54:01.667 --> 54:03.008
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't play 2DX really.

54:03.028 --> 54:03.568
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, that's right.

54:03.588 --> 54:04.449
[SPEAKER_03]: You hate 2DX.

54:04.469 --> 54:05.069
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't hate it.

54:05.089 --> 54:05.950
[SPEAKER_29]: I just don't play it.

54:07.151 --> 54:10.773
[SPEAKER_03]: Legend of Zaku wants to know, do you guys have any video game inspired drink recipes?

54:11.153 --> 54:11.434
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh.

54:12.214 --> 54:12.454
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

54:12.815 --> 54:14.056
[SPEAKER_21]: Any what inspired drink recipes?

54:14.076 --> 54:15.817
[SPEAKER_03]: Video game inspired drink recipes.

54:15.917 --> 54:17.978
[SPEAKER_03]: Like mixed drinks that are inspired by video games.

54:19.599 --> 54:20.840
[SPEAKER_03]: Burning Heat featuring Hot Damn?

54:20.860 --> 54:21.121
[SPEAKER_21]: Burning Heat.

54:21.141 --> 54:21.601
[SPEAKER_21]: Featuring Hot Damn?

54:21.861 --> 54:22.562
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good idea.

54:22.582 --> 54:25.344
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, I'm going to make up one right now.

54:25.744 --> 54:26.004
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

54:27.785 --> 54:27.945
[SPEAKER_21]: It's...

54:31.039 --> 54:36.423
[SPEAKER_21]: Goldschlager and Midori Goldschlager and Midori, remember that one?

54:36.483 --> 54:38.185
[SPEAKER_21]: Goldschlager and Midori

55:00.114 --> 55:02.676
[SPEAKER_21]: and it's made with Goldschlager and Jägermeister.

55:03.858 --> 55:05.879
[SPEAKER_21]: Two of the nasty and cheap tequila.

55:06.640 --> 55:08.882
[SPEAKER_21]: And when you puke, that's the game.

55:08.902 --> 55:11.364
[SPEAKER_21]: Because that's what Abydox look like.

55:11.545 --> 55:12.886
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, look.

55:13.046 --> 55:14.287
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a couple more quick questions.

55:14.848 --> 55:16.189
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to get to all the questions tonight.

55:16.229 --> 55:18.271
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize, guys.

55:19.732 --> 55:20.653
[SPEAKER_19]: I love Abydox.

55:20.773 --> 55:23.175
[SPEAKER_03]: Duckator wants to know, do coconuts migrate?

55:23.596 --> 55:24.777
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

55:26.000 --> 55:30.864
[SPEAKER_21]: Coconut is a non-migratory as it would be carried by an African swallow or European swallow.

55:31.584 --> 55:36.868
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's funny is once I went to the grocery store, my old roommate and I were in college and we just bought a coconut because we just wanted to play with it.

55:37.128 --> 55:41.731
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, we wanted to see if we could open it using household tools because we didn't know.

55:41.811 --> 55:43.252
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you only see on TV.

55:43.493 --> 55:45.454
[SPEAKER_03]: You were just interested in having a hairy ball.

55:45.734 --> 55:46.515
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, go to hell.

55:47.515 --> 55:48.596
[SPEAKER_03]: Just fucking go to hell.

55:49.537 --> 55:49.837
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

55:52.351 --> 55:53.091
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, two more questions.

55:53.211 --> 55:56.974
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100Matt wants to know, ask Loki when he will do another Loki Fusion.

55:58.075 --> 55:59.336
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't done one in a while.

55:59.376 --> 56:03.659
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep toying with it, and it's just, it's like writer's block, you know.

56:04.080 --> 56:06.942
[SPEAKER_03]: For those that don't know Loki Fusion, you have your own DDR remix songs, right?

56:07.242 --> 56:07.482
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

56:07.662 --> 56:11.806
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're on, what, MySpace.com slash Loki Fusion?

56:12.026 --> 56:12.386
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

56:12.726 --> 56:14.468
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

56:16.229 --> 56:17.290
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, last question.

56:17.330 --> 56:18.871
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is a great question to end on.

56:20.055 --> 56:21.456
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a serious one, okay?

56:21.656 --> 56:23.738
[SPEAKER_03]: You may have to think about this one for a minute, but everybody's got to answer.

56:24.618 --> 56:25.799
[SPEAKER_03]: At least the host, the three of us do.

56:26.539 --> 56:31.643
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could go back to the beginning prior to the show starting... This came from Solar Wing, by the way.

56:31.663 --> 56:32.243
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I said that.

56:32.263 --> 56:37.606
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could go back to the beginning prior to the show starting, would you do it again or do it differently?

56:41.829 --> 56:42.469
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a tough one.

56:42.489 --> 56:42.529
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

56:44.608 --> 56:49.849
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have said we should have had Loki on since episode one as a full-blown co-host because we just didn't know him well enough then.

56:49.889 --> 56:51.610
[SPEAKER_03]: But he wasn't a true co-host until episode 20.

56:51.650 --> 56:52.410
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people don't know that.

56:52.730 --> 56:57.371
[SPEAKER_03]: But he wasn't truly a recognized co-host of the show until... He was kind of like a Drew.

56:57.391 --> 56:58.492
[SPEAKER_03]: He just showed up all the fucking time.

56:59.072 --> 57:01.533
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, he got promoted to co-host in episode 20.

57:01.593 --> 57:03.433
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have said we would have had Loki on board episode one.

57:06.794 --> 57:07.174
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

57:07.194 --> 57:08.114
[SPEAKER_21]: I know what I would do different.

57:08.214 --> 57:08.374
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

57:08.495 --> 57:11.095
[SPEAKER_21]: Not use that retarded headset because I had a migraine the whole episode.

57:12.256 --> 57:12.516
[SPEAKER_29]: Loki?

57:13.576 --> 57:13.596
[SPEAKER_29]: I...

57:14.446 --> 57:16.788
[SPEAKER_29]: This doesn't really have anything to do with Orange Lounge, though.

57:17.369 --> 57:18.870
[SPEAKER_29]: I wouldn't have built the cabinet!

57:22.032 --> 57:23.013
[SPEAKER_29]: I know, you spent so much.

57:23.033 --> 57:25.755
[SPEAKER_29]: And I threw it away, like a baby.

57:26.536 --> 57:28.277
[SPEAKER_29]: Aborted and thrown in the dumpster.

57:28.938 --> 57:31.059
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there's anything else.

57:31.280 --> 57:33.581
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard, because, you know, we've just learned so many things.

57:33.601 --> 57:35.103
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I still have those DDR pads.

57:35.703 --> 57:39.026
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I would have tried harder in the beginning to really...

57:39.841 --> 57:47.004
[SPEAKER_03]: Believe that what we were doing was not just something we were fucking around online, but it was really generally something people wanted to listen to, and I think I would have tried to promote us better in the beginning.

57:47.224 --> 57:48.864
[SPEAKER_29]: Or more general gaming, maybe?

57:49.364 --> 57:51.245
[SPEAKER_03]: I think in retrospect, I don't know, though.

57:51.325 --> 57:54.106
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we owe the Bomani scene a lot.

57:54.246 --> 57:59.268
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, honestly, though, I would have made the shift to general gaming about a year sooner than we did.

57:59.288 --> 58:03.490
[SPEAKER_29]: We should have done podcasting, because we would have beat everybody to it by like two years.

58:03.730 --> 58:03.950
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

58:04.970 --> 58:06.691
[SPEAKER_03]: We should have invented podcasting, yeah.

58:06.711 --> 58:07.371
[SPEAKER_21]: Podcasting?

58:09.107 --> 58:09.627
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura.com

58:37.170 --> 58:40.352
[SPEAKER_21]: I do not regret a single second of it because that makes us what we are right now.

58:40.812 --> 58:42.212
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100 Matt brings up a good point.

58:42.273 --> 58:44.233
[SPEAKER_03]: We were one of the first shows to introduce Skype calls.

58:44.354 --> 58:50.937
[SPEAKER_03]: People don't recognize that, but we were probably like, if not, I would almost challenge, we were the first internet radio show to do Skype calls.

58:51.157 --> 58:52.918
[SPEAKER_03]: I would challenge that.

58:53.118 --> 58:54.819
[SPEAKER_03]: Find me a show that was doing it before we were.

58:55.719 --> 58:57.980
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we got on board with that Skype thing really early.

58:58.520 --> 58:58.981
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you think?

58:59.101 --> 59:00.942
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we were doing it before we were even podcasting.

59:02.222 --> 59:03.683
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, when Skype was in beta, we were doing it.

59:04.113 --> 59:06.305
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, I think my Skype is still the beta version.

59:10.394 --> 59:14.917
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to sound egotistical, but I like to think of the fact that we've been on the cutting edge of a few things.

59:14.997 --> 59:19.899
[SPEAKER_29]: The PSP web browser, granted we haven't done too much with that.

59:20.319 --> 59:30.864
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I think we do a great show here, I think we owe the fact that we were one of the first gaming podcasts with an already established fan base thanks to our live show is the reason why we won the podcast award last year.

59:31.425 --> 59:34.206
[SPEAKER_21]: I also think that we're not afraid to go there.

59:35.747 --> 59:40.510
[SPEAKER_21]: That's one thing that we've always tried to hold on to is we don't really censor ourselves.

59:41.311 --> 59:42.332
[SPEAKER_21]: We give it as it is.

59:42.672 --> 59:44.814
[SPEAKER_21]: If we get an explicit tag one week, fuck it.

59:45.935 --> 59:46.555
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good point.

59:46.995 --> 59:47.516
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good point.

59:47.876 --> 59:48.236
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck it.

59:48.837 --> 59:49.237
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

59:49.297 --> 59:49.858
[SPEAKER_03]: Right in the ear.

59:49.998 --> 59:51.239
[SPEAKER_21]: Fuck the fucking fuckers.

59:51.699 --> 59:52.099
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

59:52.580 --> 01:00:00.946
[SPEAKER_03]: On that note, I wanted to go around and see if anyone had any speeches, things they wanted to say to close out the show tonight.

01:00:02.127 --> 01:00:03.008
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to say I'll start.

01:00:05.057 --> 01:00:10.841
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a really interesting 200 episodes and I've learned a lot.

01:00:11.521 --> 01:00:17.965
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've received such wonderful compliments from you guys out there on the internet.

01:00:18.005 --> 01:00:22.888
[SPEAKER_03]: And it makes me feel so good because, you know, when I was in college, I did not know what the hell I wanted to do with my life.

01:00:22.948 --> 01:00:30.693
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was starting in, I was doing media arts for a while, meaning I was going to go into television and radio.

01:00:31.053 --> 01:00:33.435
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was just convinced I was not cut out for radio.

01:00:33.871 --> 01:00:38.854
[SPEAKER_03]: because I was not going to blow my way to the top, which is what most people do in the radio industry.

01:00:38.914 --> 01:00:43.456
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people that you hear on the afternoon drive probably fuck someone to get there.

01:00:43.536 --> 01:00:44.777
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wasn't down with that.

01:00:44.877 --> 01:00:52.300
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to do something, you know, I didn't, that's when I knew I did not really want to play with the big boys and work that way, that I wanted to kind of do my own thing.

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:57.423
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really appreciate Travis kind of noticing that first on Interstation Live and kind of

01:00:58.477 --> 01:01:11.485
[SPEAKER_03]: Joining me to be – or asking me to be a part of his show to kind of bring that out of me a little bit, which enabled me to get the idea going here with DarkSakura, who I think felt very enabled by that program as well, to kind of come do our own thing here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:01:11.505 --> 01:01:12.826
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been a fantastic experience.

01:01:13.166 --> 01:01:24.413
[SPEAKER_03]: And to have come now to this point where we are working with a guy who started a television network about gaming is just –

01:01:25.635 --> 01:01:27.356
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the path I wanted to take.

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:28.117
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

01:01:28.297 --> 01:01:30.119
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't want to blow my way to the top.

01:01:30.179 --> 01:01:34.322
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to work through the back door like a typical gay man.

01:01:35.063 --> 01:01:35.723
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm very happy.

01:01:35.924 --> 01:01:38.626
[SPEAKER_03]: And DarkSakura and Loki, you guys are awesome.

01:01:38.666 --> 01:01:43.230
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, I really wish we would have had you on episode one because we didn't know you.

01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:45.772
[SPEAKER_03]: Despite what you say, we didn't really know you.

01:01:46.252 --> 01:01:47.913
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's been awesome.

01:01:47.953 --> 01:01:49.575
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we lived together, we had a great time.

01:01:49.615 --> 01:01:52.397
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think we ever fought once, which made you a really great roommate.

01:01:52.437 --> 01:01:52.577
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

01:01:54.045 --> 01:01:54.985
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:02:22.651 --> 01:02:23.491
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh god, I just love you.

01:02:23.772 --> 01:02:24.492
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you're so smart.

01:02:26.173 --> 01:02:26.913
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's the point.

01:02:27.293 --> 01:02:31.175
[SPEAKER_03]: So, thank you for everything.

01:02:31.495 --> 01:02:37.958
[SPEAKER_03]: And don't ever let internet fanboy people who are pissed off that some girl likes to yell at them once in a while ever get under your skin.

01:02:38.218 --> 01:02:40.399
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know it was hard at first when we first went podcasting.

01:02:40.699 --> 01:02:41.899
[SPEAKER_03]: But they suck.

01:02:45.896 --> 01:02:48.658
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't say anything right now because I'm emo.

01:02:48.879 --> 01:02:50.040
[SPEAKER_29]: Loki, do you want to say anything?

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:51.641
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know what the hell to say.

01:02:51.661 --> 01:02:53.122
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm not good at this stuff.

01:02:53.483 --> 01:02:55.284
[SPEAKER_29]: No, it's been fun.

01:02:55.624 --> 01:02:56.946
[SPEAKER_29]: I like doing the show.

01:02:57.346 --> 01:03:02.650
[SPEAKER_29]: It's just, you know, Nellie doesn't probably like too much that I spend three hours of my week every week.

01:03:03.271 --> 01:03:08.776
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, mentally, probably way too much time on the show.

01:03:08.896 --> 01:03:11.178
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, my God, like,

01:03:11.823 --> 01:03:12.643
[SPEAKER_29]: Do stuff at work.

01:03:12.683 --> 01:03:13.803
[SPEAKER_29]: It's all game related.

01:03:13.944 --> 01:03:15.104
[SPEAKER_29]: It's always game related.

01:03:15.424 --> 01:03:16.924
[SPEAKER_29]: Everything's always game related with me.

01:03:17.384 --> 01:03:18.145
[SPEAKER_29]: Get a life, Loki.

01:03:20.025 --> 01:03:22.946
[SPEAKER_29]: Seriously, I think getting married would change everything.

01:03:23.966 --> 01:03:26.627
[SPEAKER_29]: No, it doesn't.

01:03:26.647 --> 01:03:32.808
[SPEAKER_29]: The only thing I'm focusing on now is taking the show to the next step.

01:03:32.908 --> 01:03:33.328
[SPEAKER_29]: Not letting the

01:03:37.304 --> 01:03:43.848
[SPEAKER_29]: Other big sites out there bother you with the fact that people take them more seriously and that kind of stuff.

01:03:43.868 --> 01:03:48.691
[SPEAKER_29]: Because you either have to have a big financial backing or you just got to earn the respect for it.

01:03:48.751 --> 01:03:52.774
[SPEAKER_29]: So all that comes in time and money.

01:03:53.554 --> 01:03:54.555
[SPEAKER_29]: So I don't know.

01:03:54.735 --> 01:03:55.936
[SPEAKER_29]: It's just going to be interesting.

01:03:56.056 --> 01:03:57.877
[SPEAKER_29]: I have no plans on quitting the show.

01:03:57.937 --> 01:04:00.158
[SPEAKER_29]: So however long it goes.

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:03.800
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

01:04:04.561 --> 01:04:04.741
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

01:04:05.838 --> 01:04:06.919
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:04:33.001 --> 01:04:34.201
[SPEAKER_21]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:05:03.504 --> 01:05:14.787
[SPEAKER_21]: Because there's still this vast majority of, and no offense to any of our guys listening, there's still this vast majority of men out there who think that just because they have a cock, they can tell women what to do.

01:05:14.887 --> 01:05:23.709
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think G4 fucked a lot of that for everybody, for girls everywhere, because a lot of girl gamers on that, girl gamers, quote unquote, are just a set of tits.

01:05:24.309 --> 01:05:26.910
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dark Sakura is so much more than just a nice set of tits.

01:05:27.170 --> 01:05:28.690
[SPEAKER_21]: Although they are nice.

01:05:29.090 --> 01:05:30.350
[SPEAKER_03]: They are nice tits, don't get me wrong.

01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:32.971
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's just much more than that.

01:05:33.607 --> 01:05:48.357
[SPEAKER_21]: But, you know, it actually gave, doing this show just from, even from getting on Under Sedation because it was you and Jessica, you know, Rob and Jessica.

01:05:48.578 --> 01:05:50.139
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of a nice set of tits.

01:05:50.359 --> 01:05:51.700
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:52.760
[SPEAKER_03]: She was wonderful too.

01:05:52.801 --> 01:05:56.783
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to say thank you to Jessica because, I'll go back to that in a minute.

01:05:56.803 --> 01:05:57.023
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.

01:05:57.144 --> 01:06:00.386
[SPEAKER_21]: But you guys brought me in on Under Sedation and I had been just sort of,

01:06:01.785 --> 01:06:09.988
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I've always been outspoken in front of people, but very nervous in large groups, you know, and I really got me over a lot of my, my shyness.

01:06:10.148 --> 01:06:23.913
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that my residual shyness gave me a lot more ability or I say confidence to really say, you know, tact is one thing, but censoring yourself for the sake of

01:06:24.443 --> 01:06:33.407
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, censoring the truth, I think, or how you really feel for the sake of political correctness or somebody else's retarded sensitivities.

01:06:34.467 --> 01:06:49.934
[SPEAKER_21]: Doing the show has completely opened up that side of me that has given me courage to stand up for myself as a woman, not just to the gaming community, but at work, you know, in my daily life, you know.

01:06:50.923 --> 01:06:56.706
[SPEAKER_21]: I feel completely... I mean, doing this show has been such a confidence booster.

01:06:57.566 --> 01:07:07.791
[SPEAKER_21]: And I thank everybody who has supported my loudmouth, outspoken, bitchy, Aries womanliness.

01:07:08.891 --> 01:07:09.912
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to thank all of you.

01:07:11.592 --> 01:07:14.494
[SPEAKER_21]: And whoever's king my Lancer needs to die right now.

01:07:16.415 --> 01:07:16.895
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing.

01:07:17.375 --> 01:07:17.735
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

01:07:17.975 --> 01:07:18.976
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys so much.

01:07:21.905 --> 01:07:24.767
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Drew, and Chris, if you guys want to add anything.

01:07:24.887 --> 01:07:25.408
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to.

01:07:26.689 --> 01:07:28.530
[SPEAKER_27]: Shit, guys, it's been a wild ride.

01:07:28.550 --> 01:07:30.431
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, I've been with you guys since Episode 2.

01:07:31.112 --> 01:07:33.153
[SPEAKER_27]: We jumped the shark in Episode 1, apparently.

01:07:34.294 --> 01:07:38.537
[SPEAKER_27]: But I've been here for the whole downhill ride, and I was listening when I was 16.

01:07:38.597 --> 01:07:42.240
[SPEAKER_27]: It's kind of funny that this show sort of defined...

01:07:42.987 --> 01:08:12.073
[SPEAKER_27]: my adult social life I grew up with this show and it's kind of sad and it's kind of cool at the same time because for the past few years this show has been the main constant and I go from awkward teen to intern to scapegoat to bad joke master and you know what I'm still here the show is still going strong and I hope we continue this course for a long time to come

01:08:14.278 --> 01:08:18.180
[SPEAKER_27]: This is the best thing on the internet right now, at least my opinion.

01:08:40.163 --> 01:08:43.945
[SPEAKER_03]: Jessica and I couldn't fucking stand each other the last year that we did Under Sedation Live.

01:08:44.726 --> 01:08:46.227
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's cool, we're cool now.

01:08:46.347 --> 01:08:48.328
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, so, you know, it's okay that I say that.

01:08:48.348 --> 01:08:50.629
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't say that a couple years ago, but I can say it now.

01:08:50.989 --> 01:08:52.630
[SPEAKER_03]: Jessica and I could not fucking stand each other.

01:08:52.650 --> 01:08:54.712
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was really hard to do that program.

01:08:55.192 --> 01:09:01.936
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I know from experience that being such good friends with you guys is...

01:09:03.052 --> 01:09:03.773
[SPEAKER_03]: Such a relief.

01:09:03.953 --> 01:09:06.055
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes doing this show so much easier.

01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:12.520
[SPEAKER_03]: And I truly do look forward to having this show every week as being a way that we can hang out with each other.

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:15.503
[SPEAKER_03]: Because sometimes our lives are so busy, we can't do it without this constant.

01:09:16.104 --> 01:09:21.288
[SPEAKER_21]: I do have to say, though, just to yours and Jessica's credit, you both hit it very well on there.

01:09:21.989 --> 01:09:22.849
[SPEAKER_21]: That's professionalism.

01:09:22.869 --> 01:09:29.095
[SPEAKER_03]: When I saw Chicago, the end of that movie, and if anybody wants to know exactly what it was like,

01:09:29.554 --> 01:09:30.194
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:09:44.602 --> 01:09:50.807
[SPEAKER_03]: I just remember listening to that episode and sitting at my computer about to bawl because you know what my position was in between that.

01:09:50.847 --> 01:09:52.348
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris, did you want to say anything?

01:09:52.448 --> 01:09:52.549
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

01:10:10.425 --> 01:10:11.726
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know how much I can contribute.

01:10:11.786 --> 01:10:13.947
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm kind of a new listener.

01:10:16.568 --> 01:10:18.409
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm a noob.

01:10:20.311 --> 01:10:24.553
[SPEAKER_19]: I actually met you, Rob, the first time when we saw Silent Hill.

01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:30.053
[SPEAKER_19]: That was the first time I met you, and I listened to a podcast right before that.

01:10:31.034 --> 01:10:35.197
[SPEAKER_19]: And I've never really been into video games.

01:10:35.257 --> 01:10:44.023
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I like video games, but I'm one of those people that is really interested in something, but has absolutely no idea what you guys are talking about.

01:10:44.583 --> 01:10:48.086
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's been very educational listening to you guys, and I just like...

01:10:50.851 --> 01:10:51.472
[SPEAKER_19]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:11:19.429 --> 01:11:21.211
[SPEAKER_19]: I am normal, average.

01:11:22.212 --> 01:11:22.892
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Rob, though.

01:11:23.693 --> 01:11:25.775
[SPEAKER_19]: Shut up, Rob.

01:11:25.795 --> 01:11:27.417
[SPEAKER_21]: We have one more person that has a speech.

01:11:27.617 --> 01:11:30.780
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:36.065
[SPEAKER_03]: Black Wolf in our chat room says, and you know, guesting on OLR was a highlight of my podcasting career.

01:11:37.335 --> 01:11:38.275
[SPEAKER_03]: You sappy bitch.

01:11:38.355 --> 01:11:41.256
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got a great podcast.

01:11:42.296 --> 01:11:46.097
[SPEAKER_03]: He's hit 50 himself, and he's done Dragon Con.

01:11:46.117 --> 01:11:47.957
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he's done cons bigger than we have.

01:11:48.637 --> 01:11:49.438
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get sappy.

01:11:49.738 --> 01:11:52.898
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know if it's the champagne, but I do feel a little weepy.

01:11:52.978 --> 01:11:53.839
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have another glass?

01:11:54.059 --> 01:11:54.379
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

01:11:54.999 --> 01:11:55.599
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, look.

01:11:56.639 --> 01:11:57.199
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing.

01:11:57.259 --> 01:12:04.621
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's turn this show around and start to end this thing on a positive note, because for a long...

01:12:06.983 --> 01:12:10.885
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually are going to be ending on a bit of a high note, but I ain't singing it.

01:12:11.725 --> 01:12:12.325
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the deal.

01:12:13.005 --> 01:12:24.069
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been a moment in Orange Lounge Radio's history that people, for whatever reason, just seem to love and have never shut up about since the night it happened.

01:12:24.109 --> 01:12:25.509
[SPEAKER_03]: The night it happened was November 16, 2003.

01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:31.011
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it went down in a lot of people's minds.

01:12:31.776 --> 01:12:33.237
[SPEAKER_03]: in Orange Lounge Radio's history.

01:12:33.257 --> 01:12:33.977
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's the weird thing.

01:12:34.017 --> 01:12:36.159
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie wasn't even there that night when this happened.

01:12:36.279 --> 01:12:38.720
[SPEAKER_21]: I was staying in the Harry Potter room in the gay front house.

01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:47.065
[SPEAKER_03]: And folks have been begging and begging to please post this somewhere so I can download it.

01:12:47.405 --> 01:12:48.006
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

01:12:49.066 --> 01:12:52.769
[SPEAKER_03]: So here it is, boys and girls, on this special 200th podcast.

01:12:53.489 --> 01:12:56.931
[SPEAKER_03]: A little clip from episode 69 of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:12:57.511 --> 01:12:59.973
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki Plays Karaoke Revolution.

01:13:03.537 --> 01:13:07.612
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, I just have to say, the sound quality sucks because we were on dial-up back then, okay?

01:13:07.673 --> 01:13:08.677
[SPEAKER_03]: So, just bear with us.

01:13:13.447 --> 01:13:22.011
[SPEAKER_15]: Hiho, Kermit the E-Fog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

01:13:22.051 --> 01:13:32.975
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and as promised, we're now going to show off our karaoke talents in a round of Karaoke Revolution.

01:13:33.315 --> 01:13:35.296
[SPEAKER_18]: Say it again.

01:13:36.237 --> 01:13:38.057
[SPEAKER_13]: Um... Dream...

01:15:32.347 --> 01:15:36.908
[SPEAKER_18]: That's pretty amazing, I think, since I can't sing worth a shit.

01:15:40.689 --> 01:15:42.529
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh yeah, play the instrumental solo.

01:15:43.109 --> 01:15:45.069

01:16:33.775 --> 01:16:35.217
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sick of this song.

01:16:35.497 --> 01:16:37.399
[SPEAKER_18]: You're going to really die.

01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:40.902
[SPEAKER_18]: God, this is long.

01:16:41.482 --> 01:16:43.764
[SPEAKER_18]: It just doesn't fucking end.

01:16:43.784 --> 01:16:45.766
[SPEAKER_18]: It just keeps on going on.

01:16:48.388 --> 01:16:50.770
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to kill anyone in the chat room that has a recording of this.

01:16:50.970 --> 01:16:52.051
[SPEAKER_18]: You're going to so die.

01:16:52.572 --> 01:16:53.613
[SPEAKER_18]: I know where you live.

01:16:54.654 --> 01:16:57.736
[SPEAKER_17]: As a reminder, the show will be broadcast this week on Thursday.

01:17:01.055 --> 01:17:08.010
[SPEAKER_17]: A score of 6,964 points for Loki Not even a gold record There is no justice in this world Okay

01:17:09.418 --> 01:17:11.399
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, we're going to shut the game off now.

01:17:11.479 --> 01:17:13.499
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh my god, I have not laughed that hard.

01:17:13.519 --> 01:17:15.360
[SPEAKER_17]: I laughed so hard my head scared.

01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:17.141
[SPEAKER_17]: I laughed so hard I peed, okay?

01:17:17.161 --> 01:17:18.581
[SPEAKER_17]: I peed a little.

01:17:19.381 --> 01:17:20.442
[SPEAKER_17]: I peed a little bit.

01:17:21.582 --> 01:17:23.243
[SPEAKER_21]: I got to hear this when I came back.

01:17:23.563 --> 01:17:24.583
[SPEAKER_03]: You weren't even there that week.

01:17:25.163 --> 01:17:28.184
[SPEAKER_03]: The girl in there was our original show to a madam's name.

01:17:28.324 --> 01:17:29.405
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

01:17:29.745 --> 01:17:31.325
[SPEAKER_21]: She needs to come back and be on the show soon.

01:17:31.525 --> 01:17:31.865
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki?

01:17:36.227 --> 01:17:36.467
[SPEAKER_03]: Well...

01:17:37.330 --> 01:17:38.210
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll put them up.

01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:42.812
[SPEAKER_03]: God, our show sounded like shit back then, didn't it?

01:17:44.232 --> 01:17:44.572
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

01:17:44.612 --> 01:17:47.873
[SPEAKER_03]: We should have never been a dialogue-friendly station.

01:17:48.474 --> 01:17:54.275
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, I have both recordings already edited out.

01:17:54.295 --> 01:17:57.437
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm not sure if they were recorded on my computer at the time.

01:17:57.457 --> 01:17:58.657
[SPEAKER_29]: I think they were edited out of the show.

01:17:58.877 --> 01:17:59.757
[SPEAKER_27]: Loki's going to kill me.

01:17:59.797 --> 01:18:00.898
[SPEAKER_27]: I have the deep, dark secret.

01:18:01.838 --> 01:18:03.318
[SPEAKER_27]: I was the one who distributed that.

01:18:04.359 --> 01:18:04.719
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

01:18:04.739 --> 01:18:05.119
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

01:18:05.731 --> 01:18:11.615
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing, episode 300 we have is complicated, but until then... No, now listen.

01:18:12.956 --> 01:18:21.381
[SPEAKER_29]: Here's what we'll do, because the MP3s on the MySpace page have been getting kind of stale, so we'll put both of them up.

01:18:21.521 --> 01:18:23.082
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we'll see what we can do.

01:18:24.183 --> 01:18:25.484
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought you sounded okay.

01:18:26.825 --> 01:18:28.166
[SPEAKER_29]: You should have heard complicated.

01:18:29.527 --> 01:18:33.369
[SPEAKER_29]: They made me pick a random song, so it was just like... Avril Lavigne's complicated?

01:18:33.849 --> 01:18:34.630
[SPEAKER_19]: Now that's sexy.

01:18:35.931 --> 01:18:36.512
[SPEAKER_29]: All right, guys.

01:18:36.612 --> 01:18:38.913
[SPEAKER_03]: I really, I do not like karaoke revolution.

01:18:39.073 --> 01:18:48.501
[SPEAKER_03]: We will be back here next week, as always, Sunday night, September 24th, 2006, with Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 201.

01:18:49.281 --> 01:18:50.702
[SPEAKER_03]: Same old shit, different week.

01:18:51.683 --> 01:18:53.825
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR sneak peeks continue next week.

01:18:53.885 --> 01:18:57.567
[SPEAKER_03]: Hoping to have an interview next week with a very interesting independent product.

01:18:57.587 --> 01:18:59.909
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking forward to getting more on that.

01:19:00.270 --> 01:19:00.750
[SPEAKER_03]: But for now...

01:19:01.667 --> 01:19:03.488
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

01:19:04.208 --> 01:19:06.590
[SPEAKER_03]: Drew, Drew Nami, thanks so much for being here again this week.

01:19:06.610 --> 01:19:07.290
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your final thought?

01:19:07.730 --> 01:19:09.932
[SPEAKER_27]: Be excellent to each other.

01:19:10.972 --> 01:19:12.073
[SPEAKER_27]: Chris, what's your final thought?

01:19:12.113 --> 01:19:13.013
[SPEAKER_27]: Party on, dudes!

01:19:13.454 --> 01:19:14.414
[SPEAKER_27]: Chris, your final thought?

01:19:17.296 --> 01:19:18.377
[SPEAKER_19]: I have no final thought.

01:19:18.437 --> 01:19:19.297
[SPEAKER_19]: My brain is dead.

01:19:19.377 --> 01:19:21.198
[SPEAKER_19]: But happy 200, guys.

01:19:21.338 --> 01:19:21.678
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

01:19:21.959 --> 01:19:22.499
[SPEAKER_19]: It's awesome.

01:19:22.559 --> 01:19:25.641
[SPEAKER_19]: And enjoy your fat-causing product of chocolate.

01:19:28.602 --> 01:19:31.284
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is peanut butter.

01:19:32.288 --> 01:19:49.895
[SPEAKER_29]: I think the living room was inspired by us.

01:19:49.915 --> 01:19:51.736
[SPEAKER_03]: They're playing Comcast Karaoke right now.

01:19:51.776 --> 01:19:52.776
[SPEAKER_29]: They were playing that before.

01:19:53.436 --> 01:19:58.018
[SPEAKER_29]: No, but you might see another show come back.

01:19:58.538 --> 01:19:58.818
[SPEAKER_29]: Maybe.

01:19:58.998 --> 01:20:00.199
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm not going to make any promises.

01:20:01.172 --> 01:20:02.593
[SPEAKER_29]: DarkSakura, your final thought?

01:20:02.793 --> 01:20:04.714
[SPEAKER_21]: I have to always say reject false icons.

01:20:05.015 --> 01:20:05.855
[SPEAKER_21]: It is episode 200.

01:20:05.895 --> 01:20:08.937
[SPEAKER_21]: Toto says fuckfutter.

01:20:09.357 --> 01:20:09.938
[SPEAKER_21]: Buckfutter.

01:20:10.998 --> 01:20:14.861
[SPEAKER_21]: I read that and I was thinking of that Chibamato song, Butterfucker.

01:20:16.662 --> 01:20:18.083
[SPEAKER_21]: I was singing that in my car.

01:20:20.905 --> 01:20:27.830
[SPEAKER_21]: But I'm full of emotional happy right now and cake.

01:20:27.930 --> 01:20:29.010
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, stop taking my foot!

01:20:29.531 --> 01:20:29.691
What?

01:20:33.035 --> 01:20:34.936
