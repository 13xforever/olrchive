00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

00:06.000 --> 00:15.000
To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:20.000 --> 00:26.000
And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this very special Part C to celebrate our 200th episode.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.000
Now I want to warn you guys, if this is your first time downloading Orange Lounge Radio, this is going to be a little bit different.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
This is not your typical segment of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
So I urge you to check out orangeloungeradio.com and dip back in our podcast feed and check out Parts A and B.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
We envision this section of the show to be a little more like our afterbirth segment.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
For those that listen live, you know what that is.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
It's a little bonus thing we do just for the live listeners.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
We do have a little bit more game news.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
We just filled up with stuff in Part B and just had a little more we wanted to talk about here in Part C.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.000
But first, before we get to that gaming news, what we did is we brought in a little bit of champagne.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
I promise there will be liquor tonight in one form or another.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
We're going to do a toast here to our 200th episode.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
Does anyone want to make the toast or should I just do it or what?

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Anyone want to say a little bit?

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Alright.

01:12.000 --> 01:19.000
I would say it's been a wonderful 200 episodes with you all and we're going to keep doing this as long as we possibly can.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Hopefully another 200 episodes in the future.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
Loki, anything you want to say?

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
I can't reach.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Alright.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Dr. Sakura?

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
To quote, this is the thing I always toast.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Here's to us.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Who's like us?

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Damn few.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
And they're all dead.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Toast, toast.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Yay.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Clean.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
You can't hear the cleans because they're plastic.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
That's some good Corbel.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Alright.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
You're not a big champagne fan?

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
I hate champagne.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
I like champagne but I really like it and a good mimosa.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
Why can't we just toast Guinness?

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Okay.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
When we reach 300, we toast Guinness.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Or 250 is a big number too.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
I don't know.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
I think it's going to be more like the fifth birthday because fifth birthday is pretty big so we'll see.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
Anyway, Jamie already burped the Corbel.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
That's amazing.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
That's some fizzy stuff.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
That is amazing.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Alright.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
We have a little bit of extra stories here for you guys.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Loki?

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Yes.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
A lot of fun stuff for part C.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
Anyways, I really shouldn't be paying attention.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Thank you Chat Room for your well wishes by the way.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
So, there's been a lot of rumors going around about the 360.

02:31.000 --> 02:39.000
One that keeps popping back up is Microsoft's going to release a brand new 360 with an internal HD DVD drive.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
Once again, they have said no.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
We are not releasing a SKU with an HD DVD drive.

02:46.000 --> 02:53.000
It says, it turns out you want to say in how you spend your entertainment dollars.

02:53.000 --> 03:00.000
So, who are we to burden every customer with the cost of expensive movie technology?

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
Ooh, sub Sony.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Ouch.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
That was Bill Gates whipping it out right there.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
No, that was actually a generic Microsoft employees.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
Sorry, that was a Microsoft employee whipping out their cock.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
No, that was one of their technical writers.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
I see.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
This is why I'm in school to be a tech writer.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Alright.

03:24.000 --> 03:30.000
So that I too can whip out the corporate cock.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
I don't need a corporate cock.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
I just need a cock.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Your girlfriend is still bigger.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.000
Anyway.

03:40.000 --> 03:54.000
There is actually the Game U College Tour will be making the rounds.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
It will be featuring the Xbox 360, Xbox and PC gaming.

03:58.000 --> 04:05.000
The tour will last three months and it will hit up 40 different college campuses.

04:05.000 --> 04:13.000
It's produced by Game Informer, Norcent TV and Mountain Dew and a bunch of other folks.

04:13.000 --> 04:19.000
And it's going to hopefully reach 90,000 different people.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
Some of the titles that are included are Madden NFL 07, blah, blah, blah.

04:24.000 --> 04:31.000
Rainbow Six, Saints Row, Mortal Combat Armageddon, America's Army Special Forces,

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
Splitter's Little Agent, blah, blah, blah, Project Gotham 3, Dead Rising.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
In other words, all the games Jamie does not enjoy playing.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Hey, Dead Rising.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Okay, that's cool.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
Dead Rising was hot.

04:43.000 --> 04:52.000
And there will be a Madden NFL 07 football field goal competition and the winners take home $1,000 as the prize.

04:52.000 --> 04:58.000
And Game Informer will have a Halo 2 competition each place with an unnamed prize it seems.

04:58.000 --> 05:06.000
So the tour starts on September 14th at the University of Arizona in Tucson.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
Other schools that will be visited will be just general places.

05:11.000 --> 05:18.000
They will be going to Austin, Texas, University of Texas, University of Missouri, Wichita State.

05:18.000 --> 05:28.000
Vanderbilt, Northern Kentucky, Temple University, Penn State.

05:28.000 --> 05:38.000
They will be going to State University of New York in Buffalo and Miami University of Ohio.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
That always makes me laugh.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
And of course Notre Dame in Indiana.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
All right.

05:44.000 --> 05:49.000
Well, if the game isn't coming to you, maybe you need to bring the game with you everywhere you go.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Now you know those little plug and play things, right?

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
The little joysticks you can plug into your TV.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
You see them sell these at Target all the time, right?

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
Well, these things are getting smaller and smaller and now check this out.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
They now have key chain plug and plays.

06:01.000 --> 06:09.000
A little teeny Atari joystick and a little teeny Atari paddle that you can take with you to play games on the go.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
They have actual games in these.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
It's an included six foot cable that comes with it.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
It's on a battery powered reel and you put it on the key chain here.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Then you can plug it in and play.

06:20.000 --> 06:25.000
There's one joystick that will have Asteroids and Millipede, another with Centipede and Yars Revenge,

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
and then the paddle will have Pong, Breakout, and Warlords.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
That's crazy.

06:31.000 --> 06:36.000
The key chain comes with a separate pocket sized reel that holds six feet of cords and RCA jacks.

06:36.000 --> 06:42.000
It's powered by three AAA batteries, single player only, however, since it is just a little key chain.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
That's crazy.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
I wonder what the original Atari programmers think of these.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
I know, I've got to wonder.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
That's the next Classic Gaming Expo that they do.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
They skipped here for Classic Gaming Expo so they could do the 10th anniversary.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Right.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
I'm definitely going and I'm going to ask them what they think of that because that's just crazy.

06:58.000 --> 07:06.000
GS68 says, I'm left handed, I demand a lefty stick or I will refuse to buy Atari 2600 related crap.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
Dark Tetsuya in our chat says, shame the paddle won't link up with three others.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
So, sad.

07:12.000 --> 07:17.000
Okay, well, what we're going to do now, I think that was about all the gaming news we have.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
We'll get some last minute stories in a minute if any folks have stuff.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Well, first, we have these.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
I wanted to play these since we are celebrating our 200th episode.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
We got sent a surprise from All Games, our buddies at All Games.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
So, I was going to go ahead and play this so we could hear this.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Hey Crop, did you hear the news?

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
What news?

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
Orange Lounge Radio is doing their 200th episode this week.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
What?

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Yeah.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Two hundred?

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Yeah.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Nice dedication for you.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Yeah, it is.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Two hundred shows.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Two hundred.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
That's a lot.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Yeah?

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Yeah, it is.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
You think you'll ever reach that level of dedication?

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
Well, my contract is only for thirty.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
You have a contract?

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Oops.

08:11.000 --> 08:17.000
Hey there, this is Scott from All Games Interactive wishing the guys and girls at Orange Lounge Radio

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
a happy 200th episode.

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
Sky, Dark Sacra, and Loki, you guys kick ass.

08:23.000 --> 08:29.000
In fact, to celebrate, we are going to spend the next four days playing DDR and listening to DDR music.

08:29.000 --> 08:37.000
So, from everyone here at the Arena Lounge, on 200 episodes, you guys rock.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
Do you realize how cool it would be if I could actually play V and have it sound like this?

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
Oh, anyway, Bobby Blackwolf here from that show that comes on before you guys.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
200, eh?

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
Y'all cheated, counting all those years of internet radio and all.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
But don't worry, Scott's funky episode numbering will catch up in about a month.

08:59.000 --> 09:04.000
But seriously, y'all were one of the reasons I started podcasting and I enjoy you guys each week.

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
Good luck to all of you in the future, and make sure it doesn't go downhill from here.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Someone had to say it.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
That was wonderful.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
That was so cute.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
That was so cute. I don't know what else to say.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
Just the thing that had me cracking was, you had a contract?

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
That was Kopackin and Hendrix from the show Between Us.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
You know, who are all those people at Arena yelling in the background there?

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
That was kind of interesting.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
They hired people.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Yeah, they must have hired stand-ins to do that.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
Hey Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
What?

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
I want my second glass of champagne.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Good for you.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Did you want my glass?

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
That was unintentional.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
Did you want my glass of champagne? Because I don't want it.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Let me finish this one first.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
That's what I did at your wedding.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
No, that's what I did at your wedding.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
Yeah, I want to see if Scott really does play for a day's worth of DDR.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
Because, you know, Scott's full of shit sometimes.

10:03.000 --> 10:08.000
I wonder if he's really going to do four days of DDR.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
I cannot picture him playing DDR.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
But if they do, is Black Boy still listening?

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Oh no, I don't think he is.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Somebody videotape it over at Arena Lounge.

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
God damn it, that Rob shit in the chat room needs to stop right now.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
They are just flooding our chat.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
You haven't done that since like what, episode one?

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
I think so.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
All right.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Well, All Games, we love those guys.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
And thank you guys so much for getting in on that and putting that together for us.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
That was awesome.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
Our fans also decided to ambush our voicemail line this week.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
I know we have fans.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
That's what I said too.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
Well, we had some voicemails hit our voicemail line this week.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
So we're going to play that as well.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
Hello, Orange Land Radio.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
Happy 200th episode.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Thank you.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
I love you guys.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
You're a lover.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
No, it's not Japanese hard time for it.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Really?

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Thank you.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Oh, I heart you.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Let's hit three.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Hi, Orange Land Radio.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
This is Christian Cream.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Congratulations on episode 200.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
I'm with you all the way.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Thanks.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Have a good show.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
I'm going to be looking for my stuff.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Yay, Orange Land Radio.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Whoo!

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
Hello, Sky, Loki, and Dark Sakura.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
This is DMX.

11:18.000 --> 11:23.000
I'm calling to congratulate you guys on your 200th episode.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
I don't know many podcasts at all.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
I'll be honest.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
But you guys have been around for a while.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
I've heard about you for a while.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
I just started being a part of the station in a bigger way.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
And I love you guys.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Keep up the good work.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Here's to another 200.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
You guys all take care.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Let's hit three.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
This is MPV operator 6160 with a message.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Hello, Orange Land Radio.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
And congratulations on your 200th episode.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Hope for many more in the future.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Pooh, you're out.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Hey, it's Misty.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
And I'm pretty sure that I'm going

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
to be listening tonight anyway.

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
But I just wanted to say, in a more personal way,

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
congrats on reaching episode 200.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Bye.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Wow.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
That was really sweet, you guys.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Thank you very much.

12:11.000 --> 12:11.000
I know.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
I like the guy.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
I think it was Yuri Lever who sounded like he was talking.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
And he had just had this.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Oh, god.

12:18.000 --> 12:18.000
Red versus blue.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Who is that?

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Camus.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
Camus.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
He sounded like Camus.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
I have to go to the bathroom now.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
I have the microphone to the phone.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
And you tell everybody what you just told me.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
Uh-oh.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Dan?

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
What?

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
What did he say?

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Tell us what you just told me.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Are you getting it?

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
All right.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
On the count of three.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
One, two, three.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
Congratulations.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
We can't hear it.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
We can't hear it.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
What's he saying?

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Just tell us what he's saying.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
From everybody here, Pat Bucher.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Do you have speakerphone on that?

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
No.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
I do have speakerphone.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
Oh, yeah.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
Put it on speakerphone.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
One second.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
We warned you guys it would be random.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
OK.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Is that it?

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
Is this your husband?

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
This is Dan.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
OK.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Say it again.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Uh, congratulations on your 200th episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Man, I didn't think you'd make it to, you know, two.

13:01.000 --> 13:14.000
We didn't think we'd make it to two either.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
Wow.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.520
That was nice.

13:17.520 --> 13:18.520
Everybody's getting in on the love.

13:18.520 --> 13:19.520
You're still on speakerphone.

13:19.520 --> 13:22.520
You're still there.

13:22.520 --> 13:23.520
Close the damn phone.

13:23.520 --> 13:24.520
We've got other stuff to get to.

13:24.520 --> 13:27.520
Don't wait.

13:27.520 --> 13:28.520
Bye, sweetie.

13:28.520 --> 13:29.520
All right.

13:29.520 --> 13:30.520
Dork.

13:30.520 --> 13:31.520
Yes.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.440
I'm saying this on the radio.

13:33.440 --> 13:40.640
My husband is a dork, but he brings me pinballs, so that's why I keep them around.

13:40.640 --> 13:41.640
This is great radio.

13:41.640 --> 13:42.640
You know what?

13:42.640 --> 13:43.640
We're all drinking champagne.

13:43.640 --> 13:44.640
What can I say?

13:44.640 --> 13:45.640
This is the second time Dan's been on the show.

13:45.640 --> 13:47.880
This is great champagne.

13:47.880 --> 13:49.360
Any last minute stories tonight?

13:49.360 --> 13:50.360
Loki.

13:50.360 --> 13:51.360
Yes.

13:51.360 --> 13:52.360
Of course, I have stuff.

13:52.360 --> 13:57.840
The first thing I want to talk about is release dates, because, of course, I have stuff.

13:57.840 --> 14:02.280
It's all very interesting and always very controversial.

14:02.280 --> 14:07.840
This mostly is from Sega, who we've had some problems with in the past about Phantasy Star

14:07.840 --> 14:13.620
Universe, but anyways, let's talk about next gen, shall we?

14:13.620 --> 14:19.880
Virtual Fighter V for the PlayStation 3 is slated to come out March 15th of next year,

14:19.880 --> 14:21.200
so look forward to that.

14:21.200 --> 14:28.240
Also gracing our presence will be Virtual Tennis 3 for both the PlayStation 3, the Xbox

14:28.240 --> 14:35.520
360, and the PSP, all those coming out on the 21st of March next year.

14:35.520 --> 14:40.800
This one we ran on the site also, and this is probably the first you'll hear of it.

14:40.800 --> 14:48.000
Full Auto 2 coming to the PSP March 14th, so it's not just PlayStation 3 anymore.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.560
Very interesting on that.

14:50.560 --> 14:55.800
And then this one, which is very controversial, since there was some news from From Software

14:55.800 --> 14:58.760
that this version might not be coming out.

14:58.760 --> 15:06.360
Coming from Sega, Armored Core 4 on both the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360, March 21st.

15:06.360 --> 15:11.480
These dates were just updated in our system on the 11th of September, so this is very

15:11.480 --> 15:13.760
fresh news.

15:13.760 --> 15:19.640
Also After Burner for the PSP coming out March 21st as well, so look forward to those wonderful

15:19.640 --> 15:22.640
Sega games March of next year.

15:22.640 --> 15:27.200
Alright, I am going to open up the Skype line over at Orangelaunchradio.com, click on interact

15:27.200 --> 15:32.920
with us, or you can always call us on the regular telephone as well, it's 916-226-9067.

15:32.920 --> 15:36.320
I imagine the Skype line is going to be very popular tonight, we'll get through as many

15:36.320 --> 15:39.960
calls as we can, we're practically dedicating a whole segment to it, we'll see.

15:39.960 --> 15:43.160
Well, they're already coming in, so let's pick up a call and start going.

15:43.160 --> 15:45.520
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

15:45.520 --> 15:46.520
This is Meg Z.

15:46.520 --> 15:47.520
Hi Meg Z!

15:47.520 --> 15:48.520
Meg Z!

15:48.520 --> 15:49.520
How are you Meg Z?

15:49.520 --> 15:50.520
I am fantastic.

15:50.520 --> 15:51.520
I just went deaf.

15:51.520 --> 15:54.560
From all the girly screaming in here, I think I just went deaf.

15:54.560 --> 15:56.560
What's on your mind?

15:56.560 --> 15:57.560
Wii!

15:57.560 --> 15:58.560
Wii!

15:58.560 --> 16:01.440
Are you excited about the Wii news, or are you just celebrating our 200th episode with

16:01.440 --> 16:02.440
us?

16:02.440 --> 16:03.440
A little bit of both.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.840
Alright, you're definitely going to be getting a Wii?

16:05.840 --> 16:11.840
Oh man, the morning after I knew, I had called my GameStop at 9 in the morning to see if

16:11.840 --> 16:15.960
we could do reserves yet, and unfortunately we couldn't, but yes, I will be getting a

16:15.960 --> 16:16.960
Wii.

16:16.960 --> 16:17.960
Alright!

16:17.960 --> 16:18.960
What games do you want to pick up?

16:18.960 --> 16:24.160
I would like to stress that I predicted the date.

16:24.160 --> 16:25.160
How did you predict the date?

16:25.160 --> 16:27.160
Did you just pull it out of your butt, or did you make connections?

16:27.160 --> 16:28.160
Here's my reasoning.

16:28.160 --> 16:29.160
Here's my reasoning.

16:29.160 --> 16:34.280
Okay, so if you guys with decent memories remember, the GameCube launched shortly after

16:34.280 --> 16:39.640
the Xbox did, and it did phenomenally that holiday season.

16:39.640 --> 16:44.920
And the PS3 launches on a Friday, the 17th of Friday, and I know Nintendo likes to launch

16:44.920 --> 16:49.440
their systems on Sundays, so I said, hey, Sunday the 19th, that could be their release

16:49.440 --> 16:50.440
date.

16:50.440 --> 16:51.440
That's my prediction.

16:51.440 --> 16:55.600
And then not three hours later, the information got leaked that it was going to be released

16:55.600 --> 16:57.040
on that Sunday.

16:57.040 --> 17:05.320
I'm sitting here looking at a text message on my phone that says November 19th from Megzi.

17:05.320 --> 17:07.920
Well good job on that, making an educated guess to do it.

17:07.920 --> 17:11.560
So your internet penis grew by two inches for that.

17:11.560 --> 17:12.560
Congratulations.

17:12.560 --> 17:15.040
I've also got a funny story.

17:15.040 --> 17:16.960
Yeah, the funny story.

17:16.960 --> 17:22.920
Okay, so lately I've been trying to catch up on games that I might have missed.

17:22.920 --> 17:25.640
They came out and they were great, but for some reason I didn't pick them up.

17:25.640 --> 17:28.280
So the other day I picked up Metroid Prime, right?

17:28.280 --> 17:32.160
Because I never got a chance to play it and I wanted to try it out.

17:32.160 --> 17:35.960
So after I got off of work, I called Chris and-

17:35.960 --> 17:38.200
Chris is looking angry at this story already.

17:38.200 --> 17:40.200
Oh, she's flipping you off.

17:40.200 --> 17:41.200
All right, let's hear it.

17:41.200 --> 17:44.600
So I called up Chris and I was like, so this is what I did during my day.

17:44.600 --> 17:52.400
And I picked up Metroid Prime and she says, oh, is that the one with the monkey?

17:52.400 --> 17:56.640
Aw, poor Chris.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.240
We love you, Chris.

17:58.240 --> 18:03.040
And so we decided we're going to make a game called Metroid Primate.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.320
I thought it was a different game.

18:04.320 --> 18:06.640
I did not claim to be an expert on video games.

18:06.640 --> 18:10.560
I know, but Metroid and a monkey, what was your-

18:10.560 --> 18:11.720
I'm going to prove to you.

18:11.720 --> 18:12.720
I thought it was a different game.

18:12.720 --> 18:15.120
That's why you thought it was like Dungeon Siege or something.

18:15.120 --> 18:16.120
No, I didn't.

18:16.120 --> 18:17.120
I thought it was an RP.

18:17.120 --> 18:18.640
Megsy, it's Dungeon Zoo.

18:18.640 --> 18:19.640
Shut up.

18:19.640 --> 18:20.640
Dungeon Zoo.

18:20.640 --> 18:26.720
I'm still going- Megsy, we need to like start doing pictures of Metroid Primates.

18:26.720 --> 18:27.720
Hells yeah.

18:27.720 --> 18:28.720
All right.

18:28.720 --> 18:29.720
Me.

18:29.720 --> 18:30.720
Me.

18:30.720 --> 18:31.720
Me.

18:31.720 --> 18:32.720
Me.

18:32.720 --> 18:33.720
Heart.

18:33.720 --> 18:34.720
Heart, we love you, Chris.

18:34.720 --> 18:35.720
You hear this?

18:35.720 --> 18:36.720
She's invited the biteage.

18:36.720 --> 18:37.720
I do want to point out though, Wonder Dog Harold in our chat room says Samus with a

18:37.720 --> 18:38.800
pet monkey would be the best.

18:38.800 --> 18:41.280
I bet she'd- We love you, Chris.

18:41.280 --> 18:46.600
You bring us- Speaking of pets, you heard this week that

18:46.600 --> 18:50.680
they announced Seaman 2 for the PlayStation 2 coming out.

18:50.680 --> 18:51.680
Tee hee.

18:51.680 --> 18:52.680
What?

18:52.680 --> 18:53.680
Tee hee.

18:53.680 --> 18:54.680
All right.

18:54.680 --> 18:57.280
Megsy, we got to take some more calls because everybody's trying to get in tonight, but

18:57.280 --> 18:59.280
any last words?

18:59.280 --> 19:03.000
Oh, Reggie, you're so fine.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
You're so fine.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
You blew my mind.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Hey, Reggie.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Hey.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
All right.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Hey, Reggie.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Reggie fan.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
I'm sorry.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
All right.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Aw, Chris is pouting.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
You want to say anything to Megsy, Chris?

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
I love you.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
I hate you.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
I love you too.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
I hate you so much.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.280
Hey, Chris.

19:21.280 --> 19:22.280
You know what that- Megsy.

19:22.280 --> 19:23.280
Megsy.

19:23.280 --> 19:24.280
Megsy, you know what that means though?

19:24.280 --> 19:25.280
You know what that means though?

19:25.280 --> 19:26.280
What?

19:26.280 --> 19:27.280
Makeup sex.

19:27.280 --> 19:28.280
Ooh.

19:28.280 --> 19:29.280
All right.

19:29.280 --> 19:30.280
See you later.

19:30.280 --> 19:31.280
See ya.

19:31.280 --> 19:32.280
Bye.

19:32.280 --> 19:33.280
I thought you were making a trip to Wisconsin pretty soon, Chris.

19:33.280 --> 19:34.280
I know.

19:34.280 --> 19:35.280
I'm going next weekend.

19:35.280 --> 19:36.500
And there's going to be lots of makeup sex.

19:36.500 --> 19:37.500
Lots and lots of makeup sex.

19:37.500 --> 19:38.500
Hi.

19:38.500 --> 19:39.500
You're on Orange.

19:39.500 --> 19:40.500
Whoa.

19:40.500 --> 19:41.500
We're getting feedback.

19:41.500 --> 19:42.500
Hi.

19:42.500 --> 20:12.480
Hi, this is Bob Coffee from the chat room.

20:12.480 --> 20:38.200

shitty first call. That's alright, no no, you got a bad hum so that's alright

20:51.080 --> 20:52.320
you'll be able to hear it and

20:52.320 --> 20:55.600
try to figure out what the problem is. I gotta let you go though buddy. Thanks so much for the call

20:55.600 --> 20:56.880
we like hearing from new people

20:56.880 --> 21:01.120
interesting thought that Nintendo 64 was going to be $249 when it first came out

21:01.120 --> 21:03.480
and then they cut the price last minute could that happen again

21:03.480 --> 21:07.000
I think the pack-in game kinda breaks this deal here I think with Wii Sports

21:07.000 --> 21:09.720
being in there I think $250 is kinda set in stone

21:09.720 --> 21:13.920
I don't see it getting cut at the last minute but who knows anything's possible right

21:13.920 --> 21:17.080
right? I think it all comes down to their feedback

21:17.080 --> 21:20.760
they get from people. Alright let's go to another call. Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

21:20.760 --> 21:23.840
Greetings my brother and sister in

21:23.840 --> 21:27.840
this is Mel B actually. Hi Mel!

21:27.840 --> 21:32.080
Wow, Mel you were here forever ago. You've known of Orange Launch Radio since

21:32.080 --> 21:33.720
episode like six

21:33.720 --> 21:39.400
Pretty much. Wow. I've seen you in like what maybe three different studios already

21:39.400 --> 21:43.560
Yeah we've been to a lot of different places we've gotten evicted from a lot of places

21:43.560 --> 21:48.480
What's on your mind buddy? Oh well you know it's 200 you know I had to weigh in you know

21:48.480 --> 21:51.680
say congratulations to you guys. Appreciate it

21:51.680 --> 21:55.840
you know it's just I'm just really proud of how you guys have grown by

21:55.840 --> 22:00.160
within this 194 episodes I guess since I first seen you

22:00.160 --> 22:03.400
I mean I can remember back in the day when you know it's like

22:03.400 --> 22:06.760
you guys would have to be scrapping to get contact left and right

22:06.760 --> 22:10.800
like you know I'd be trying to hook you up with this and now you guys are like making a name on

22:10.800 --> 22:13.720
your own and it's like you know I can just fade in the background and

22:13.720 --> 22:18.400
I mean you guys have just been darn good ever since. Well we appreciate you you know taking a

22:18.400 --> 22:21.280
chance on the show when it was such a little deal you know you were a big name

22:21.280 --> 22:24.640
in the DDR scene for freestyle and everything well still are too just

22:24.640 --> 22:25.680
you know DDR in general

22:25.680 --> 22:28.960
you know you haven't had a lot of tournaments lately but you know you came on our show

22:28.960 --> 22:30.160
kinda early on

22:30.160 --> 22:33.680
and a lot of people recognize you from freestyle so that's great

22:33.680 --> 22:37.280
and you know it kind of enabled us to be all friends and stuff after that so

22:37.280 --> 22:43.000
really it was kind of good to have Mr. DDR on there. Yeah guys actually both kind of like cutting one of those first radio promos for you back then.

22:43.000 --> 22:47.120
Yeah it was awesome. So what do you think of the DDR scene now versus four years ago when the show

22:47.120 --> 22:47.600
started?

22:47.600 --> 22:50.920
I think I mean a lot of it

22:50.920 --> 22:54.560
kinda I mean it's been a major shift whereas before there was sort of like a

22:54.560 --> 22:59.160
kinda like a 60-40 split where freestyle was bringing in a lot of casual

22:59.160 --> 22:59.880
people in

22:59.880 --> 23:03.760
but now it's become such a technical sport now with Perfect Attack and White Hot

23:03.760 --> 23:07.040
it's pretty much a standard now. Freestyle is sort of like

23:07.040 --> 23:10.040
I think people just aren't pushing each other nowadays to be better

23:10.040 --> 23:13.520
they're just kinda like waiting for some tournament to come around they're just doing

23:13.520 --> 23:18.480
something good enough to win so there really just isn't that progress for quite yet

23:18.480 --> 23:22.760
and I don't see one up because Supernova's got so many darn songs that you know

23:22.760 --> 23:26.000
people were begging for but you know what can you do I mean

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
I'm sure I'm gonna break out some more routine sooner or later but you know until then

23:30.000 --> 23:34.160
I guess I'll just be laying in the cut. Is In the Groove partially to blame for

23:34.160 --> 23:35.120
freestyle

23:35.120 --> 23:39.240
going down and PA going up?

23:39.240 --> 23:43.440
Well I mean there just wasn't that much to do in the group for freestyle but I think

23:43.440 --> 23:43.920
kind of

23:43.920 --> 23:47.960
I think with freestyle it was just sort of like to the point where

23:47.960 --> 23:51.280
I think I mean just kinda looking back now just in retrospect

23:51.280 --> 23:54.560
I think a good freestyle sort of has a very short

23:54.560 --> 23:57.920
life span I guess if you could say it's sort of like

23:57.920 --> 24:02.000
you're hot for a good six months or a year but then afterwards it's like judges

24:02.000 --> 24:05.120
you know get tired of your act and you know they want to see something new but

24:05.120 --> 24:08.560
no one new has really stepped up since like 2003, 2004

24:08.560 --> 24:13.520
So well I hope Supernova can just turn some of that around I guess we'll see huh?

24:13.520 --> 24:17.320
I'm pretty sure I mean I do know some people that are still hungry and waiting for their

24:17.320 --> 24:20.240
big chance to you know break out on the team that I think

24:20.240 --> 24:23.840
it's gotta be the onus is on a lot of people who are big into

24:23.840 --> 24:27.440
freestyle community that still have name value to put together events even

24:27.440 --> 24:31.200
doesn't even have to be like a tournament for a thousand bucks whatever you just could

24:31.200 --> 24:34.600
get good get-togethers you know just videotape it and you know just get the

24:34.600 --> 24:36.240
word around by you know whatever

24:36.240 --> 24:38.800
YouTube will get people back into Spain

24:38.800 --> 24:42.160
well it'll be very interesting to see what happens you know in the future and

24:42.160 --> 24:45.520
everything and I know OLR wants to do some type of DDR tournament we've got

24:45.520 --> 24:47.720
some ideas so we'll see what happens in the future

24:47.720 --> 24:50.560
you can definitely count on me to give you a hand with that one

24:50.560 --> 24:53.320

25:48.280 --> 25:53.240

26:26.920 --> 26:30.040

26:30.040 --> 26:34.400
hi you're on Orange Lawn's radio who's this? hey it's Little Rain again hi what's on your mind Little Rain?

26:34.400 --> 26:37.520
two things yep first

26:37.520 --> 26:42.440
congratulations on having 200 episodes thank you very much

26:42.440 --> 26:45.880
appreciate it I have out a few friends with their podcast and

26:45.880 --> 26:49.680
trying to get first live radio and then podcast

26:49.680 --> 26:53.080
it's amazing that you guys have made it this far

26:53.080 --> 26:57.560
it's a big fan mark we're amazed too that we've lasted this long it's something else

26:57.560 --> 27:00.840
I think probably it's crossed all three of our minds at one point or another

27:00.840 --> 27:02.080
that we wanted to quit

27:02.080 --> 27:05.320
but there's something that always brings us back to doing this

27:05.320 --> 27:09.880
I'll never do that I'll admit there was there was one week where it was pretty bad I was

27:09.880 --> 27:12.520
having a really emo week and I was about ready to come on here and go I quit

27:12.520 --> 27:17.480
but you know in the end it's really you know it's about you guys and about you

27:17.480 --> 27:19.160
know of course Loki and Dark Sakura

27:19.160 --> 27:22.280
just getting to hang out with them every week and everything and while we may

27:22.280 --> 27:25.800
have our ups and downs sometimes you know it all comes back to games here at

27:25.800 --> 27:27.560
Orange Lawn's radio so it's it's good

27:27.560 --> 27:30.880
it's the it's the great equalizer

27:30.880 --> 27:34.640
and second thing was I saw the Nintendo Wii press conference

27:34.640 --> 27:37.040
well what did you think?

27:37.040 --> 27:40.640
well yay that it's coming out so early I was

27:40.640 --> 27:43.840
half thinking it was going to be delayed but you know they

27:43.840 --> 27:48.120
they actually kept it and they also were talking about

27:48.120 --> 27:52.160
how you can put like videos on the memory card

27:52.160 --> 27:55.640
and play them back

27:55.640 --> 27:58.720
now do you think with codecs and all that do you think

27:58.720 --> 28:01.800
everything's going to work universal or you could just download something

28:01.800 --> 28:06.280
or pay 20 Wii points and get the newest codec that works with everything?

28:06.280 --> 28:10.000
Do you have a thought, Loki?

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
You know what they're running as far as graphics

28:13.000 --> 28:16.680
you know a graphics card in there. Would it be licensing with the codecs too

28:16.680 --> 28:20.160
could come into play? Some codecs are free but yeah I mean

28:20.160 --> 28:24.080
this is whatever they want to do I mean it I'm sure it's going to support like

28:24.080 --> 28:25.880
MPEG-2 and stuff like that because

28:25.880 --> 28:29.760
I mean they were basically kind of thinking can you take your camcorder and you

28:29.760 --> 28:33.160
plug in your SD memory card from that into there and you get to watch videos

28:33.160 --> 28:38.040
alright well you going to be picking up a Wii?

28:38.040 --> 28:41.400
Oh yes. Alright.

28:41.400 --> 28:44.720
I'm going to be picking up the PS3. You are going to get a PS3.

28:44.720 --> 28:48.200
I told you I had to. Oh that's right that's right because you had to buy the one for your friend

28:48.200 --> 28:49.800
because of the bet and everything. Alright well

28:49.800 --> 28:54.040
you're not going to buy one for yourself? Well the Wii for myself, yes.

28:54.040 --> 28:57.960
The PS3, hell no. Why not? Why no PS3 for yourself?

28:57.960 --> 29:02.800
There's nothing at launch that really drives me to get it.

29:02.800 --> 29:06.440
Sony's gonna have to sell it really really sell it at Tokyo Game Show to show

29:06.440 --> 29:07.600
us why we need one at launch

29:07.600 --> 29:11.200
should be interesting. Alright. Thanks.

29:11.200 --> 29:14.400
No problem. Hey we gotta let you go buddy because we got more calls coming in but thanks so

29:14.400 --> 29:15.360
much for calling in tonight.

29:15.360 --> 29:19.240
Alright later. Lots and lots of calls tonight. We really appreciate it.

29:19.240 --> 29:23.200
Let's go to another call. Oh my gosh we're getting so many calls tonight. Hi you're on Orange

29:23.200 --> 29:24.400
Falls Radio. Who's this?

29:24.400 --> 29:27.920
Raven's Dolphin. Hi Raven's Dolphin. What's on your mind buddy?

29:27.920 --> 29:32.080
Sorry I'm on my cell phone but this is Skype's working.

29:32.080 --> 29:35.400
That's alright you know we're getting hammered left and right tonight. What's on your mind?

29:35.400 --> 29:38.800
I got a hairline

29:38.800 --> 29:42.040
fracture on my DS. How'd that happen?

29:42.040 --> 29:45.120
I don't know and I replaced it

29:45.120 --> 29:48.720
and BB charged me 50 bucks for it. Ouch!

29:48.720 --> 29:52.840
You didn't have one of those replacement policy things or whatever? No I had it.

29:52.840 --> 29:55.960
But you'll trade it in and you'll get a black one.

29:55.960 --> 30:01.120
Oh huh interesting. Was this a DS Lite that cracked or a DS Fat?

30:01.120 --> 30:04.200
Oh it was a Lite and I was pissed.

30:04.200 --> 30:08.480
Wow yeah I got a lot of problems with that. But didn't Nintendo do some type of

30:08.480 --> 30:12.760
replacement system or was that just the UK? I don't remember. It's been so long now.

30:12.760 --> 30:15.840
They charged you 50 bucks to replace it?

30:15.840 --> 30:20.280
Was it your fault?

30:20.280 --> 30:23.640
Here's the thing. They replaced it but

30:23.640 --> 30:27.320
it would only be a white one. It wouldn't be a free black one which pissed me off.

30:27.320 --> 30:31.920
Oh I see. Did you have a black one or did you have a white one and you wanted to get a black one?

30:31.920 --> 30:36.880
I had a white one and I wanted to get a black one. Ah well that's why they charged you for it.

30:36.880 --> 30:40.480
God it's just a stinking color though but I guess you know maybe there's more

30:40.480 --> 30:42.680
demand for the black ones right now or something I don't know.

30:42.680 --> 30:47.880
Why would you want a black one? It wouldn't match your Wii. Well everyone wanted a black one.

30:47.880 --> 30:53.520
Didn't you say you wanted a pink one? I want a pink one! I almost bought one at Walmart but I'm poor.

30:53.520 --> 30:58.080
Because we don't make money off OLR. But some day.

30:58.080 --> 31:03.880
Anything else on your mind Raven's Dolphins? We have to get some more calls.

31:03.880 --> 31:07.520
Oh sure. There's one more thing on my mind.

31:07.520 --> 31:11.520
It's they're doing the right thing with it.

31:11.520 --> 31:15.400
How so?

31:15.400 --> 31:18.560
Because how the name is and how they're setting it up

31:18.560 --> 31:22.320
they're really putting Sony in jeopardy this time.

31:22.320 --> 31:26.520
We'll all see after the Christmas season when the numbers come out. I think you might be right though.

31:26.520 --> 31:29.840
Alright I'm definitely trying to get a Wii.

31:29.840 --> 31:33.400
I'm going to stand in the freezing cold on a Walmart

31:33.400 --> 31:38.000
or at EB. I'm paying someone to get it. Just let's hope that whole little

31:38.000 --> 31:40.840
thing about what they're supposedly doing in Hawaii with the whole fifty

31:40.840 --> 31:42.120
dollars to reserve

31:42.120 --> 31:45.720
or fifty dollars in trade-ins to reserve it doesn't catch on nationwide because

31:45.720 --> 31:46.600
that's kinda poopy.

31:46.600 --> 31:51.280
So we'll see. Alright guys so I'm gonna cut it short and go.

31:51.280 --> 31:55.200
Alright. It's all good buddy. Have a good one.

31:55.200 --> 31:58.640
Alright. Lay it up. Wow we're just getting

31:58.640 --> 32:01.680
more and more calls. We'll just keep it going. Why not? We have a whole nother

32:01.680 --> 32:04.920
section to show here tonight. Let's go to another call. Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio.

32:04.920 --> 32:05.400
Who's this?

32:05.400 --> 32:09.720
It's me Ron. What's up fellas? Hey how you doing? Hey wait a minute. I'm doing good.

32:09.720 --> 32:14.640
I do not believe the lady sitting behind me is a fella. Ron, how could you forget?

32:14.640 --> 32:19.440
I splashed you with stupid stuff from China. What can I tell you?

32:19.440 --> 32:24.560
I am not cursed. Alright. What's on your mind, Rama? Not much. A few things. I finally saw a

32:24.560 --> 32:27.080
Dance Revolution yesterday and it wasn't that bad.

32:27.080 --> 32:31.240
Really? I heard it was a vomit in my mouth. You know what's interesting?

32:31.240 --> 32:35.240
The show is not being carried in Sacramento so we couldn't see it.

32:35.240 --> 32:38.560
Yeah. It's not on a CBS out there? No it's not on a CBS.

32:38.560 --> 32:43.520
I looked at the preview guide and there was not anything there. So kudos to KOVR 13.

32:43.520 --> 32:47.800
Good job guys. No crap on that network. Good job.

32:47.800 --> 32:52.040
Does Viacom own them? I don't know but I heard there was no like actual DDR

32:52.040 --> 32:53.400
stuff on the show. There wasn't.

32:53.400 --> 32:59.400
It's the same font and that's about it. It's basically Dance Fever with little

32:59.400 --> 33:03.880
kids and it's a contest and the grand prize is a $25,000 scholarship from Konami.

33:03.880 --> 33:08.480
Okay so why was that not shitty? I don't know because I thought it wasn't so bad.

33:08.480 --> 33:12.400
It broke the mold. Everybody was thinking it was going to be DDR this, DDR that, you know?

33:12.400 --> 33:16.200
Are you a twelve-year-old girl?

33:16.200 --> 33:19.680
No. Okay. Do you think twelve-year-old girls will like the show?

33:19.680 --> 33:24.640
I have no idea. Bandit in our chat room says,

33:24.640 --> 33:28.040
fuck Dance Fever. Fuck you too. Alright.

33:28.040 --> 33:32.220
Anything else on your mind buddy? I wanted to say some other things

33:32.220 --> 33:35.360
but I have here in my hands a 22 ounce

33:35.360 --> 33:40.040
ounce of Guinness and I'm about to open it up and I'm having a toast here for you guys.

33:40.040 --> 33:43.680
I appreciate that. A toast to you? Yeah. Here's to you,

33:43.680 --> 33:47.280
here's to me, the best of friends we will be. But if we should ever happen to agree,

33:47.280 --> 33:47.680
well

33:47.680 --> 33:51.000
fuck you and here's to me. I'm down on this bitch right now.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.080
Enjoy that Guinness motherfucker. I'll see you in October.

33:54.080 --> 33:58.080
Got that shit right. Later.

33:58.080 --> 34:02.000
Let's go to one of our old favorites. I've been making the poor bastard wait all night.

34:02.000 --> 34:06.280
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this? One and only Legend of Zaku.

34:06.280 --> 34:10.640
What's on your mind Mr. Zaku? Well, just, you know,

34:10.640 --> 34:14.720
200 episodes man. That's a feat right there that you can't

34:14.720 --> 34:18.840
accomplish without effort. It wouldn't be a 200th episode without our

34:18.840 --> 34:22.080
200 minutes worth of phone calls caller here, Zaku.

34:22.080 --> 34:26.040
Yes. Digital life's coming up. You excited? You going to go see Final Fantasy XII?

34:26.040 --> 34:31.680
Yeah, that and I'm trying to pick out a freestyle routine. I'm trying to pick out a song most importantly.

34:31.680 --> 34:34.880
I kind of have a case of Freestyler's Block at the moment.

34:34.880 --> 34:38.280
Alright, you going to come visit me in October because I'm coming to New York?

34:38.280 --> 34:41.560
Yeah, most definitely. I'll even give you the stuff that I'm a

34:41.560 --> 34:45.400
snag from Digital Life. You going to get us another signed poster? Because that was pretty bad ass.

34:45.400 --> 34:50.040
He got us this signed poster. That depends if Rocks or Red Octane has something set up.

34:50.040 --> 34:53.400
We'll take anything. We like free things. Oh, alright then.

34:53.400 --> 34:57.840
You know Supernova's Patch came out last week, right?

34:57.840 --> 35:01.400
That's right. We have a patch and there's a new song in it, right? Some type of remix?

35:01.400 --> 35:04.520
Fascination Eternal Love Remix. Should be fun.

35:04.520 --> 35:07.720
It basically is a

35:07.720 --> 35:11.880
remix of Fascination Max

35:11.880 --> 35:17.240
but with the sounds that you get from opening a door in the car.

35:17.240 --> 35:22.760
The little ringing sound and just a lot of phone ringing right there.

35:22.760 --> 35:25.520
I think you have the video up there on your site.

35:25.520 --> 35:28.000
Okay.

35:28.000 --> 35:35.000
Anyways, the last thing. I don't get how Nintendo flip flops on what they say.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.360
On one side they said they were going to be reaching free but on the other

35:38.360 --> 35:42.080
they act as if they didn't exist. They end up denying it.

35:42.080 --> 35:45.680
Someone hasn't made a final decision on it. Management can't.

35:45.680 --> 35:48.880
The left hand's not talking to the right hand. That's exactly what's going on.

35:48.880 --> 35:51.960
Happens in corporate America all the time.

35:51.960 --> 35:56.780
I was pretty excited on Thursday when I heard all these wonderful fairy tales

35:56.780 --> 35:57.720
about the Wii.

35:57.720 --> 36:01.440
Then all of a sudden we have this little black eye

36:01.440 --> 36:05.000
that came days later.

36:05.000 --> 36:08.800
Was the news the end of the world though, Zaku?

36:08.800 --> 36:13.760
I mean, you know what? Screw the Wii and PS3.

36:13.760 --> 36:17.080
It's all about Happy Sky CS. That's it.

36:17.080 --> 36:19.820
I'm focusing all my energy on something besides the hype.

36:19.820 --> 36:23.480
Beatmania is the only game you need, huh?

36:23.480 --> 36:26.880
Sounds fair. We got to let you go, Zaku. We got more calls.

36:26.880 --> 36:31.320
Peace.

36:31.320 --> 36:36.400
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

36:36.400 --> 36:39.640
Hi, it's Arcadian42.

36:39.640 --> 36:42.640
What's on your mind?

36:42.640 --> 36:46.480
I had to call in because I haven't listened in a while. I had a connection from the first show

36:46.480 --> 36:50.720
since I think I was there. You were there on the first show and this is the

36:50.720 --> 36:52.400
most we've ever heard from you

36:52.400 --> 36:56.880
in like 200 episodes worth of shows.

36:56.880 --> 37:00.240
No, I know. We appreciate your support over the years, Arcadian42.

37:00.240 --> 37:03.960
It's been less recently since I've been playing

37:03.960 --> 37:07.640
too many video games lately. What do you think of the Wii?

37:07.640 --> 37:11.320
It looks like it will be interesting. I haven't really been following the news,

37:11.320 --> 37:16.040
but since I might have money soon, I might actually be able to buy one.

37:16.040 --> 37:19.080
Awesome. Is that the system of choice

37:19.080 --> 37:22.880
amongst the three? I don't know. I'll have to see what I want.

37:22.880 --> 37:27.520
Alright, sounds good. Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

37:27.520 --> 37:32.000
Not really. Just congratulations on your 200 episodes.

37:32.000 --> 37:35.200
Maybe I'll see you and come to a future show.

37:35.200 --> 37:38.480
Yeah, anytime. The door's open to you anytime.

37:38.480 --> 37:41.320
That's awesome. Thank you so much. It really means a lot to us that we have

37:41.320 --> 37:43.920
folks that remember us all the way from episode one still calling in.

37:43.920 --> 37:47.040
I know you've been a longtime supporter of the show. We really appreciate it, my friend.

37:47.040 --> 37:50.520
Alright. Alright, have a good one, buddy. You too. Later.

37:50.520 --> 37:55.160
Lots and lots of good news. Let's do at least one more call here. Hi, you're on Orange Lomps Radio.

37:55.160 --> 37:55.800
Who's this?

37:55.800 --> 37:58.760
AJ Twist. Hi, what's on your mind?

37:58.760 --> 38:02.880
Just calling in to say happy 200th birthday.

38:02.880 --> 38:05.800
Thank you.

38:05.800 --> 38:08.880
Yeah, that's it. Seeing how you guys are.

38:08.880 --> 38:12.200
Basically, I want to talk to Dark Sakura about Tekken DR.

38:12.200 --> 38:15.640
Okay. Dark Sakura?

38:15.640 --> 38:19.400
Yes. How are you liking the game?

38:19.400 --> 38:24.600
I have to say that I like it a whole lot because I'm just such an uber Tekken fan girl

38:24.600 --> 38:25.040
that

38:25.040 --> 38:28.960
it's all about. Though, I always play with Jin every time.

38:28.960 --> 38:32.560
But it's really fun. I like that you have so many different characters to choose from.

38:32.560 --> 38:35.360
It's pretty cool.

38:35.360 --> 38:38.880
I don't know if you remember my letter I wrote in.

38:38.880 --> 38:42.320
Two, three, four months ago, maybe? Oh, it was the Pink Yoshi?

38:42.320 --> 38:48.000
I think... I seem to recall a handle named Pink Yoshi because I'm sure I would have made

38:48.000 --> 38:48.520
fun of it.

38:48.520 --> 38:52.560
Yeah, yeah, you did. I see.

38:52.560 --> 38:55.760
Nothing personal, my friend.

38:55.760 --> 39:01.760
No, it's all good. But yeah, I'm still up for some good matches with you, Dark Sakura, and Tekken.

39:01.760 --> 39:03.920
Some day? Some time?

39:03.920 --> 39:07.680
Some time. Right now it's been kind of crazy busy, but I'm

39:07.680 --> 39:12.160
working on trying to set some time aside. If I can ever wrestle the

39:12.160 --> 39:16.480
PSP away from Dan, except he's been... I'll have to take it when he's distracted with

39:16.480 --> 39:17.000
pinball.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.280
You guys will have to set up some time on the Orange House Radio message forums.

39:20.280 --> 39:23.720
Yeah, send me a message on the forums and we'll see about setting something up.

39:23.720 --> 39:26.760
Are you aware of the ghost system?

39:26.760 --> 39:30.400
I'm sorry? Are you aware of the ghost system? No, actually.

39:30.400 --> 39:33.920
If you play through the dojo,

39:33.920 --> 39:38.280
eventually you can unlock the ghost system, which records your character as you play

39:38.280 --> 39:41.720
and act as your ghost, and you can play that.

39:41.720 --> 39:45.080
Other players can play that online. Oh, that's pretty cool. That's kind of neat.

39:45.080 --> 39:48.600
I'll have to do that, then. Once you get that ghost,

39:48.600 --> 39:52.080
maybe you can somehow rip it out of the PSP and

39:52.080 --> 39:57.960
online, send it over to me and I'll send you my ghost. Wow, that's kind of neat. I wish they did that for Mario Kart.

39:57.960 --> 40:01.640
I'll have to set some time aside.

40:01.640 --> 40:05.400
Check out Tekken if I may plug in the site. Is that alright?

40:05.400 --> 40:08.800
Yeah, I'm going to miss that. Tekken what? Tekken Zaibatsu.

40:08.800 --> 40:12.440
Oh, the Tekken Zaibatsu? Yeah, they have a

40:12.440 --> 40:15.920
little forum on that, too. Oh yeah, I used to go to that site all the time

40:15.920 --> 40:19.800
to get all the pictures and everything from the official Namco art.

40:19.800 --> 40:24.400
I haven't been to that. I actually haven't been to that site in easily a year. I forgot about it.

40:24.400 --> 40:27.960
But no, I... Yeah, it hasn't been too big lately.

40:27.960 --> 40:31.160
Not much going on. No, that's a cool site. I'll have to check out the forum.

40:31.160 --> 40:34.080
Thanks. Alright, any other thoughts?

40:34.080 --> 40:37.120
Yeah, oh, Logi. Huh?

40:37.120 --> 40:40.600
A question about the PSP on hacking it.

40:40.600 --> 40:44.640
Since you're big on that. What now? A question on the PSP hacking.

40:44.640 --> 40:50.000
Yeah. Do you know any cool type of media players that can play playlists?

40:50.000 --> 40:53.200
Hmm, that can play playlists.

40:53.200 --> 40:56.920
I know they had some stuff where you can stream

40:56.920 --> 41:00.120
playlists from your PC.

41:00.120 --> 41:04.600
Yeah, I know that one, too. What's the website you always use? PSP updates or something?

41:04.600 --> 41:08.080
PSP updates has a lot of stuff on there. Check it out. Yeah, I'll go check around there more.

41:08.080 --> 41:13.000
Alright. Alright, thanks anyways. Well, we gotta let you go, my friend. We got some more calls to

41:13.000 --> 41:15.360
get through, and then we're gonna end the show.

41:15.360 --> 41:18.600
Yeah, happy 200th episode again, and have a good night.

41:18.600 --> 41:22.320
Alright. Have a good one, buddy. Bye-bye.

41:22.320 --> 41:26.120
Alright, we at least... This number's been trying to hammer us for a little bit now.

41:26.120 --> 41:28.160
Alright. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio. Who's this?

41:28.160 --> 41:29.160
I made it!

41:29.160 --> 41:31.400
Hi, whoa, hi. Who's this?

41:31.400 --> 41:32.360
This is DT.

41:32.360 --> 41:35.040
Huh? Oh, DT, what's on your mind?

41:35.040 --> 41:37.800
Oh, I've been trying to call in for...

41:37.800 --> 41:42.120
ever since the segment opened. I know we've been hammered tonight. It's crazy. What's on

41:42.120 --> 41:44.720
your mind, my friend?

41:44.720 --> 41:47.720
Well, I just wanted to wish you guys a happy 200th.

41:47.720 --> 41:51.080
Appreciate it. You've been with us since, like, episode one, right?

41:51.080 --> 41:54.120
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

41:54.120 --> 41:58.640
Well, what do you think about the Wii News? Are you gonna be picking up a Wii?

41:58.640 --> 42:01.520
I'll probably get one for Christmas.

42:01.520 --> 42:05.840
What games in particular are you looking forward to?

42:05.840 --> 42:08.280
Uh, hmm, well...

42:08.280 --> 42:10.560
Red Steel looks kinda cool.

42:10.560 --> 42:13.200
Not Smash Bros. Brawl? Although, I know that's not Smash Bros. Brawl.

42:13.200 --> 42:14.200
Oh, yeah.

42:14.200 --> 42:16.120
You're pumped up for that, right?

42:16.120 --> 42:17.520
Oh, yeah.

42:17.520 --> 42:21.200
So, actually, speaking of Smash Bros. Brawl, are there any other characters that you wanted

42:21.200 --> 42:25.760
to see in it, either Konami or Nintendo?

42:25.760 --> 42:29.880
Well, I was kinda hoping Lolo and Lala would be in it.

42:29.880 --> 42:31.520
Oh, wow.

42:31.520 --> 42:33.640
Lolo and Lala.

42:33.640 --> 42:36.600
Oh, my God, that is old school.

42:36.600 --> 42:37.880
What would they do, turn...

42:37.880 --> 42:42.040
They would turn your character into eggs and then push boxes at you.

42:42.040 --> 42:43.040
There you go.

42:43.040 --> 42:44.040
Way old school.

42:44.040 --> 42:45.040
That's pretty cool.

42:45.040 --> 42:51.840
Well, DT, I know you've been supporting us since episode one. We really, really appreciate

42:51.840 --> 42:55.360
it. Your enthusiasm for this station has been wonderful, and I know you work for our site

42:55.360 --> 42:57.880
now, and we love having you on board. Thanks so much for calling in.

42:57.880 --> 42:58.880
Anytime.

42:58.880 --> 42:59.880
All right, have a good one, my friend.

42:59.880 --> 43:00.880
I'll get you.

43:00.880 --> 43:03.040
Bye-bye. We'll have to play DDR together someday.

43:03.040 --> 43:04.040
I'll have to throw down with him sometime.

43:04.040 --> 43:07.440
I haven't seen him in a while. He's local. We, like, never see each other. It's crazy.

43:07.440 --> 43:12.040
DT, do I have to tell you? He, like, lives just around the corner practically. We never

43:12.040 --> 43:14.600
see him. It's kind of sad.

43:14.600 --> 43:15.600
All right.

43:15.600 --> 43:16.600
I see him at Dan's store.

43:16.600 --> 43:17.600
Oh.

43:17.600 --> 43:18.600
I randomly run into him at Dan's GameStop.

43:18.600 --> 43:22.000
Oh, snap. Well, thank you guys so much for calling. Oh, we've got one more. We'll make

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
this real quick.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.160
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

43:24.160 --> 43:25.160
Uh, ActDeft.

43:25.160 --> 43:30.240
Oh, yes. What's on your mind, ActDeft? Gotta be quick.

43:30.240 --> 43:31.240
I'm calling from Mexico.

43:31.240 --> 43:32.240
Oh.

43:32.240 --> 43:35.760
Can I ask you to mail to me, too, for your 200th sale?

43:35.760 --> 43:36.760
Thank you.

43:36.760 --> 43:38.240
What's on your mind?

43:38.240 --> 43:42.360
We are going to rock you.

43:42.360 --> 43:46.760
I agree. The we is going to be awesome. Well, thank you so much for calling in. We've got

43:46.760 --> 43:49.040
to keep it short, though, because we've got to get to our next segment. But that's awesome

43:49.040 --> 43:52.680
to hear from people outside of the U.S. once in a while. We love hearing from Canada, Mexico,

43:52.680 --> 43:53.680
U.K. We love it.

43:53.680 --> 44:00.760
Is he still there? Hello? There must be a delay. I think he hung up. Oh, well.

44:00.760 --> 44:01.760
Oh.

44:01.760 --> 44:02.760
Oh, well. Well, thank you. We appreciate it.

44:02.760 --> 44:03.760
Thanks for calling.

44:03.760 --> 44:06.400
I know. I think that's the first call from Mexico we've gotten.

44:06.400 --> 44:07.400
I think so.

44:07.400 --> 44:08.400
How sweet.

44:08.400 --> 44:09.400
Cool. Thank you.

44:09.400 --> 44:10.400
Bye.

44:10.400 --> 44:11.400
Bye.

44:11.400 --> 44:12.400
I'm going to go to Cabo someday. I've never been to Mexico, but I want to go to Cabo.

44:12.400 --> 44:14.400
I'm going to go to Tijuana.

44:14.400 --> 44:19.400
All right. We're going to do this now. I warned you this would be a little bit random. We're

44:19.400 --> 44:24.280
going to bring back a segment that you guys who listen to the old show know. And those

44:24.280 --> 44:27.260
of you guys who joined us in the podcast, maybe you've never heard this segment before.

44:27.260 --> 44:32.380
But it's been known to get a little bit weird and a little bit random and a little bit questiony.

44:32.380 --> 44:35.320
It's this old segment called Ask Orange Lounge.

44:35.320 --> 44:46.540
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question. Well, will we find out this week on Orange

44:46.540 --> 44:52.800
Lounge Radio? I'm sure it's going to be interesting because we haven't allowed this segment on

44:52.800 --> 44:59.120
in over a year because the questions have been lame.

44:59.120 --> 45:07.080
So let's see what you guys have pent up over the past year. DMN wants to know, what's the

45:07.080 --> 45:11.760
most fun thing and the most frustrating thing about doing Orange Lounge Radio?

45:11.760 --> 45:19.840
The most fun thing is having my ego grow. And the most frustrating thing is this room

45:19.840 --> 45:31.360
with the door shut. It does get quite hot in here. I don't know.

45:31.360 --> 45:35.560
Just trying to stay on top of the news is kind of tough during the week. Remembering

45:35.560 --> 45:41.400
to update my show rules. I would say the most fun thing about Orange

45:41.400 --> 45:46.360
Lounge Radio. Oh, it's so much fun. No, but it's getting that instant feedback of having

45:46.360 --> 45:50.520
people like whether it be Dark Soccer or Loki like right here in my ear or having the chat

45:50.520 --> 45:53.400
room there. I think having that feedback on your opinions

45:53.400 --> 45:57.100
is really great and kind of neat. I don't know. It's just like the reward I get from

45:57.100 --> 46:00.680
it is instant gratification. You know I'm a typical male.

46:00.680 --> 46:04.900
The most frustrating thing about doing Orange Lounge Radio is losing my Sunday nights. As

46:04.900 --> 46:08.120
much as I enjoy hanging out, but it's tough because it means you only really get a one

46:08.120 --> 46:11.960
day weekend. So that's been frustrating. But I don't know. I guess you're just used to

46:11.960 --> 46:14.760
it after 200 weeks now, right? That's how I feel.

46:14.760 --> 46:19.400
You're just kind of used to it. I have fully timed it. How long do I have to

46:19.400 --> 46:25.600
leave the South Bay now to get here? Guys, since we have about at least 20 people

46:25.600 --> 46:29.640
who submitted questions tonight, we can't get all your questions in, so we apologize.

46:29.640 --> 46:32.840
The things that are a little too random and weird, we may not be able to get to tonight.

46:32.840 --> 46:37.000
I apologize. OL Army Eddie wants to know, where can I get

46:37.000 --> 46:42.320
all these cool songs you play? The internet. The internet is not just for

46:42.320 --> 46:49.840
iTunes. If you ever want to know, try asking in chat. Try emailing one of us. The thing

46:49.840 --> 46:54.040
is that when you guys ask during the show, sometimes we're so busy like operating the

46:54.040 --> 46:57.440
behind the scenes stuff that we can't answer questions right away. But if you can like

46:57.440 --> 47:01.440
hum a few bars, we'll tell you. You can always send us an email. I'm more than fine with

47:01.440 --> 47:06.760
sharing song titles. Send me an email.

47:06.760 --> 47:10.480
Also he wants to know, I guess I'll go ahead and entertain this question. What would cause

47:10.480 --> 47:18.480
Sky to go straight? Be graphic if needed. Oh, Chris. What was that Chris? That might

47:18.480 --> 47:26.160
be a good start. I would say One Hot Night with Gina Gershon or Beyonce. I don't know

47:26.160 --> 47:34.440
why I love Beyonce. She's so hot. She's really hot. No, I don't know. Honestly, boobs and

47:34.440 --> 47:40.520
poon anner just don't do it for me. I'm sorry. I'm sure you appreciate the aesthetic value

47:40.520 --> 47:43.400
of boobs. I asked the women out there, do boobs and

47:43.400 --> 47:49.200
poon anner do it for you? Well, I know this is probably not the best room to ask this

47:49.200 --> 47:53.120
question in, but I'm asking the other women out there. That's how I feel. And guys out

47:53.120 --> 48:01.680
there, if you're a straight man, does penis do it for you? That's how I feel about boobs

48:01.680 --> 48:07.440
and poon anner. Are you gay? If you scream phone call, you're gay.

48:07.440 --> 48:17.940
Act Deaf wants to know, can you speak Spanish? Uno pequeño de Español, si. I had two years

48:17.940 --> 48:23.920
of Spanish or dos años de Español in Colegio, but I'm not very good at it. I only remember

48:23.920 --> 48:29.080
a few words here and there. El telefono es en fuego.

48:29.080 --> 48:33.080
I would like to learn more. I took French and Japanese, so I can also

48:33.080 --> 48:38.060
say that the TV is on fire. Act Deaf also wants to know, what's your opinion

48:38.060 --> 48:41.320
on Mexican zoning? Pump it up. What's wrong with that?

48:41.320 --> 48:42.880
Nothing wrong with that. That's pretty hot.

48:42.880 --> 48:48.640
More games for everyone. That's a good thing. No problems there. Unless the country actually

48:48.640 --> 48:56.120
bought the game. I don't know. Black Wolf says, how can you type with boxing

48:56.120 --> 49:03.040
gloves on your hands? What? A very large keyboard.

49:03.040 --> 49:09.540
Use your toes. Lo cuisintes cléverdan. God damn you people that bring Homestar Runner

49:09.540 --> 49:13.440
into this show. No, I love Homestar Runner. I can't complain,

49:13.440 --> 49:20.000
but you guys are funny. Check on the PMs, check on the PMs.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.520
E-mail. Dark Tetsuya wants to know, so what's it like

49:22.520 --> 49:26.800
going from reporting on hypodermic needles in Solo 2000 to the Nintendo Wii?

49:26.800 --> 49:30.000
Nostalgia. Wow, nostalgia. That was one of our first

49:30.000 --> 49:33.200
big topics. I remember calling that arcade.

49:33.200 --> 49:37.640
I said, oh, you'll have to talk to our manager. I remember that too. We were pretty cutting

49:37.640 --> 49:39.600
out. That was when I was sleeping in the Harry Potter

49:39.600 --> 49:43.400
room in the gay frat house. That was awesome.

49:43.400 --> 49:47.600
Wow. Yeah, we were. I remember doing the recording

49:47.600 --> 49:54.120
a podcast. No, not even a podcast. We were recording a live show while I was playing

49:54.120 --> 49:57.960
BeatMania and they were trying to talk to me like, I'm trying to play 3, 2, 1 stars,

49:57.960 --> 50:02.720
dammit. You know, it's just been crazy. There's been

50:02.720 --> 50:06.880
a lot of, it's funny how games have changed in the past four years because when we started

50:06.880 --> 50:10.400
doing this show, Max 2 was new in the arcades and then we went through Extreme, we went

50:10.400 --> 50:16.160
through a drought, now we're into Supernova. All right, more songs. We want to get out

50:16.160 --> 50:20.480
of here before midnight tonight. GS68 wants to know, do any of you play O2Jam?

50:20.480 --> 50:24.760
I tried it out about six months ago and I had a pretty good time with it. I just haven't

50:24.760 --> 50:32.800
been back. I don't do well with the games. I don't know. I'm not good at checking in

50:32.800 --> 50:37.120
regularly with games like that for some reason. I did play recently a game that somewhat reminded

50:37.120 --> 50:41.040
me of it though, which was the R2B, which was kind of fun. I should check it out again

50:41.040 --> 50:45.040
and see what's changed there. Has anyone else played O2Jam? No? Yes? No?

50:45.040 --> 50:53.720
I looked at it at E3 and then walked on. All right. Let's see. NintendoManiac64 wants

50:53.720 --> 50:58.680
to know, could I race Loki at Mario Kart DS? I never got the chance and I've gone anti-snaking

50:58.680 --> 51:03.560
since nine months ago. That sounds like a 12-step program.

51:03.560 --> 51:10.680
I literally dusted off Mario Kart DS today. I haven't played that game in months.

51:10.680 --> 51:17.300
All right. Bandit wants to know, if train A is traveling at 50 miles per hour from Pittsburgh

51:17.300 --> 51:21.520
and train B is traveling at 35 miles per hour from California, which state will they meet

51:21.520 --> 51:24.800
in order to resupply the Orange Lawns radio with more Chocobo Nuggets?

51:24.800 --> 51:29.480
Wisconsin! Wisconsin! African or European?

51:29.480 --> 51:34.720
Africa! NazgulSlayer wants to know, question, is there

51:34.720 --> 51:37.640
a Castro district ghetto? Yes!

51:37.640 --> 51:43.760
How about the whole place is ghetto? I actually feel safer there than just about

51:43.760 --> 51:45.880
any other places in San Francisco. Yeah, actually if you go around San Francisco

51:45.880 --> 51:48.760
it's the safest place I feel. Except for the homeless man who was laying

51:48.760 --> 51:52.520
with his cock out. Around for your birthday we found something

51:52.520 --> 51:57.760
in the window and it's about like that big around and it's a penis and we're going

51:57.760 --> 52:01.680
to get you for your birthday. I'm going to chase you around the house with

52:01.680 --> 52:05.920
it. We also found you a codless body suit.

52:05.920 --> 52:11.160
That's disgusting. Rama wants to know, you need to talk about

52:11.160 --> 52:15.520
the Spanish DDR movie? Yeah, that's right. I watched the trailer

52:15.520 --> 52:18.120
for that. La machina de ballar.

52:18.120 --> 52:20.960
It actually looks kind of funny. I want to see the actual movie before I talk

52:20.960 --> 52:23.340
about it. You know, trailers can be deceiving, right?

52:23.340 --> 52:25.120
The trailer looked funny. All right.

52:25.120 --> 52:28.640
Poto wants to know, dear Orange Lawns radio, if you had to be a species of bird, extinct

52:28.640 --> 52:31.440
or not, which would you be? Dodo.

52:31.440 --> 52:34.120
The dodo, I'm hearing Drew and Chris saying. What do you think?

52:34.120 --> 52:36.440
I would be a. You'd be a fucking parrot.

52:36.440 --> 52:41.320
I'd be a pterodactyl. You'd be the one who shared it with everyone.

52:41.320 --> 52:45.840
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack. Wait, wait, wait.

52:45.840 --> 52:47.840
What is that bird? It's not a parrot.

52:47.840 --> 52:50.800
It's another bird that lives as long as a human does.

52:50.800 --> 52:53.000
Chicken? No, not chicken.

52:53.000 --> 52:58.760
No, not chicken. Lovely human. I'd be Toucan Sam.

52:58.760 --> 53:01.460
But I don't remember exactly what type of bird it is, but it's a bird that lives as

53:01.460 --> 53:04.400
long as a human and is actually very intelligent. A vulture?

53:04.400 --> 53:06.920
No, not a vulture. Ooh, I'd be a vulture.

53:06.920 --> 53:10.000
No, I'd be a raven because I'm all goth. Nevermore.

53:10.000 --> 53:13.600
What about the Norwegian blue? Lovely plumage. Lovely plumage.

53:13.600 --> 53:16.160
All right. He's pining for the fjords.

53:16.160 --> 53:21.120
He's not pining. He's passed on.

53:21.120 --> 53:26.720
This is an ex-parrot. Let's go to the next question here.

53:26.720 --> 53:31.280
Sakarina wants to know, do you guys have VJ Army accounts, and if so, what's your DJ name?

53:31.280 --> 53:36.840
I do have one, and I haven't ever updated it. I think it's Saku.

53:36.840 --> 53:40.080
I don't have one. I have one. I've never updated it. DJ 223M.

53:40.080 --> 53:43.240
I don't even know what it is. Yeah, I think mine's DJ Saku.

53:43.240 --> 53:47.160
I don't update it. It's too much work for me. I like BeatMania, but I haven't played

53:47.160 --> 53:51.120
it enough regularly lately. What's your favorite, also from Sakarina,

53:51.120 --> 53:56.440
what's your favorite 2DX style? Seventh.

53:56.440 --> 54:02.640
Eighth. Logie? I don't know. I don't play 2DX, really.

54:02.640 --> 54:07.200
Oh, yeah, that's right. You hate 2DX. I don't hate it. I just don't play it.

54:07.200 --> 54:11.080
Legend of Zaku wants to know, do you guys have any video game inspired drink recipes?

54:11.080 --> 54:13.960
Ooh, no. Any what inspired drink recipes?

54:13.960 --> 54:18.160
Video game inspired drink recipes, like mixed drinks that are inspired by video games.

54:18.160 --> 54:22.480
Burning Heat featuring Hot Damn. That's a good idea.

54:22.480 --> 54:27.920
Okay, I'm going to make up one right now. Okay.

54:27.920 --> 54:42.520
It's Everclear. Anything with Everclear. It'll have Everclear and let's see what else

54:42.520 --> 54:47.800
is pretty awesome. It'll just be Everclear and it'll call it

54:47.800 --> 54:54.400
the Super Metroid, because it'll suck your life out.

54:54.400 --> 54:58.160
Goldschlager is nasty shit. Goldschlager and Midori, remember that one?

54:58.160 --> 55:04.200
The drink is called the Abadox and it's made with Goldschlager and Jagermeister, two of

55:04.200 --> 55:09.080
the nasty and cheap tequila. And when you puke, that's the game.

55:09.080 --> 55:13.160
Because that's what Abadox looked like. All right, look.

55:13.160 --> 55:16.200
Just a couple more quick questions. We're not going to get to all the questions tonight.

55:16.200 --> 55:20.800
I apologize, guys. I love Abadox.

55:20.800 --> 55:24.280
Duckator wants to know, do coconuts migrate? Yes.

55:24.280 --> 55:31.640
Coconuts are non-migratory as would be carried by an African Swallow or European Swallow.

55:31.640 --> 55:34.200
You know what's funny is once I went to the grocery store, my old roommate and I were

55:34.200 --> 55:36.960
in college and we just bought a coconut because we just wanted to play with it.

55:36.960 --> 55:41.880
We wanted to see if we could open it using household tools, because we didn't know.

55:41.880 --> 55:45.120
Like you only see on TV. You were just interested in having a hairy

55:45.120 --> 55:46.560
ball. Oh, go to hell.

55:46.560 --> 55:49.800
Just fucking go to hell. All right.

55:49.800 --> 55:56.320
Oh, no, two more questions. SSJ100 Matt wants to know, ask Loki when he will do another

55:56.320 --> 55:59.360
Loki Fusion. I haven't done one in a while.

55:59.360 --> 56:04.040
I keep toying with it and it's just like writer's block, you know.

56:04.040 --> 56:07.160
For those that don't know Loki Fusion, you have your own DDR remix songs, right?

56:07.160 --> 56:11.440
Yeah. And they're on, what, Myspace.com slash Loki

56:11.440 --> 56:12.440
Fusion? Yeah.

56:12.440 --> 56:17.240
All right. All right, last question.

56:17.240 --> 56:21.720
I think this is a great question to end on. This is a serious one, okay?

56:21.720 --> 56:24.640
You may have to think about this one for a minute, but everybody's got to answer.

56:24.640 --> 56:29.280
At least the host, the three of us do. If you could go back to the beginning, prior

56:29.280 --> 56:32.280
to the show starting, this came from Solar Wing by the way, I don't know if I said it.

56:32.280 --> 56:36.640
If you could go back to the beginning, prior to the show starting, would you do it again

56:36.640 --> 56:44.520
or do it differently? This is a tough one.

56:44.520 --> 56:47.920
I would have said we should have had Loki on since episode one as a full blown co-host

56:47.920 --> 56:51.560
because we just didn't know him well enough then, but he wasn't a true co-host until episode

56:51.560 --> 56:53.840
20. A lot of people don't know that, but he wasn't

56:53.840 --> 56:57.760
truly a recognized co-host of the show until, he was kind of like a Drew, he just showed

56:57.760 --> 57:01.480
up all the fucking time. But yeah, he got promoted to co-host on episode

57:01.480 --> 57:06.680
20. I would have said we would have had Loki on board episode one.

57:06.680 --> 57:08.320
I don't know. I know what I would do different.

57:08.320 --> 57:10.000
What? Not use that retarded headset because I had

57:10.000 --> 57:14.520
a migraine the whole episode. Loki?

57:14.520 --> 57:17.300
This doesn't really have anything to do with Orange Lounge though.

57:17.300 --> 57:21.840
I wouldn't have built the cabinet. That was your pride and joy.

57:21.840 --> 57:27.260
I know, you spent so much. And threw it away like a baby, aborted and

57:27.260 --> 57:31.800
thrown in the dumpster. I don't think there's anything else. It's

57:31.800 --> 57:35.520
hard because we've just learned so many things. You know, I still have those DDR pads.

57:35.520 --> 57:41.160
I think I would have tried harder in the beginning to really believe that what we were doing

57:41.160 --> 57:44.360
was not just something we were fucking around online, but that it was really generally something

57:44.360 --> 57:47.080
people wanted to listen to and I think I would have tried to promote us better in the beginning.

57:47.080 --> 57:51.700
Or more general gaming maybe? I think in retrospect, I don't know though.

57:51.700 --> 57:56.120
We owe the Bamani scene a lot. I think honestly though, I would have made

57:56.120 --> 58:01.160
the shift to general gaming about a year sooner. We should have done podcasting because we

58:01.160 --> 58:05.000
would have beat everybody to it by like two years.

58:05.000 --> 58:11.560
We should have invented podcasting. I still think that we've done pretty good

58:11.560 --> 58:15.600
for something that was conceived on the Bart after a trip to the Metronome.

58:15.600 --> 58:19.600
No regrets. I mean sure, there's always things that you might say, well gee, in retrospect

58:19.600 --> 58:23.280
maybe I should have done that, but no regrets. Well, this is what I think about regret. If

58:23.280 --> 58:27.520
you regret anything you have or have not done, you regret the person that you are today.

58:27.520 --> 58:32.880
So in respect to the show, I don't regret anything because our show is what it is based

58:32.880 --> 58:37.080
on the decisions that we've made, the interaction of our listeners.

58:37.080 --> 58:40.680
I do not regret a single second of it because that makes us what we are right now.

58:40.680 --> 58:43.880
SSJ100Matt brings up a good point. We were one of the first shows to introduce Skype

58:43.880 --> 58:47.800
calls. People don't recognize that, but we were probably like, if not, I would almost

58:47.800 --> 58:50.980
challenge, we were the first internet radio show to do Skype calls.

58:50.980 --> 58:56.240
I would challenge that. Find me a show that was doing it before we were because we got

58:56.240 --> 58:59.720
on board with that Skype thing really early, don't you think? Because we were doing it

58:59.720 --> 59:00.720
before we were even podcasting.

59:00.720 --> 59:02.120
We were doing it when Skype was in beta.

59:02.120 --> 59:04.600
Yeah, when Skype was in beta we were doing it because I was like...

59:04.600 --> 59:06.800
Actually, I think my Skype is still the beta version.

59:06.800 --> 59:07.800
So anyway...

59:07.800 --> 59:10.080
Skype was first in beta.

59:10.080 --> 59:13.600
I mean, I'm not trying to sound like egotistical, but I like to think of the fact that, hey,

59:13.600 --> 59:15.600
we've been on the cutting edge of a few things. It's been pretty...

59:15.600 --> 59:19.120
The PSP web browser, granted we haven't done too much with that.

59:19.120 --> 59:24.480
I mean, although I think we do a great show here, I think we owe the fact that we were

59:24.480 --> 59:28.880
one of the first gaming podcasts with an already established fan base thanks to our live show

59:28.880 --> 59:31.840
as the reason why we won the podcast award last year.

59:31.840 --> 59:35.920
I also think that we're not afraid to go there.

59:35.920 --> 59:41.360
That's one thing that we've always tried to hold onto is we don't really censor ourselves.

59:41.360 --> 59:46.080
We get it as it is. If we get an explicit tag one week, fuck it.

59:46.080 --> 59:48.760
Very good point. Very good point. Fuck it.

59:48.760 --> 59:49.760
Yeah.

59:49.760 --> 59:50.760
Right in the ear.

59:50.760 --> 59:51.760
Fuck the fucking fuckers.

59:51.760 --> 59:58.140
All right. On that note, I wanted to go around and see if anyone had any speeches, things

59:58.140 --> 01:00:01.440
they wanted to say to close out the show tonight.

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:05.160
I just want to say, you know, I'll start.

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:13.280
It's been a really interesting 200 episodes, and I've learned a lot, and I've received

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:18.480
such wonderful compliments from you guys out there on the internet, and it makes me feel

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:22.360
so good because, you know, when I was in college, I did not know what the hell I wanted to do

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:29.200
with my life, and I was starting in, I was doing media arts for a while, meaning I was

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:32.960
going to go into television and radio, but I was just convinced I was not cut out for

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:38.000
radio because I was not going to blow my way to the top, which is what most people do in

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000
the radio industry.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.320
A lot of people that you hear on the afternoon drive probably fuck someone to get there,

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:44.800
and I wasn't down with that.

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:48.800
I wanted to do something, you know, that's when I knew I did not really want to play

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:52.440
with the big boys and work that way, that I wanted to kind of do my own thing.

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:59.760
So I really appreciate Travis kind of noticing that first on Station Live and kind of asking

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:03.640
me to be a part of his show to kind of bring that out of me a little bit, which enabled

01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:07.600
me to, you know, get the idea going here with Dark Soccer, who I think felt very enabled

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:11.640
by that program as well, to kind of come do our own thing here on Orange Lawn Radio, and

01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:17.960
it's been a fantastic experience, and to have come now to this point where we are working

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:26.840
with a guy who started a television network about gaming is just, that's the path I wanted

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:27.840
to take.

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:28.840
You know what I mean?

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:30.120
I didn't want to blow my way to the top.

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:36.000
I wanted to work through the back door like a typical gay man, and I'm very happy.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.600
And Dark Soccer and Loki, you guys are awesome.

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:43.000
And Loki, I really wish we would have had you on episode one, because we didn't know

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.480
you, despite what you say, we didn't really know you.

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:50.000
But it's been awesome, and when we lived together, we had a great time, and I don't think we

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.480
ever fought once, which made you really great roommates.

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:58.840
So that was just awesome, and getting to do the show that apartment in Dark Soccer, sometimes

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:01.920
I want to jump out of this chair and strangle you for some of the things that you say on

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:02.920
this program.

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:03.920
I love you.

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:09.320
No, but I love you to death, I love you to bits, and don't ever let anyone out there

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:13.000
tell you that you're not good enough for this show, because you are good enough for this

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:18.480
show, and you know so much about gaming and stuff, and the guys do not give you enough

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:19.560
credit sometimes.

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:23.680
You are a girl gamer, and oh God, I just love you.

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:24.680
I think you're so smart.

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:25.680
You're a record.

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:28.820
Well, that's the point.

01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:34.600
So thank you for everything, and don't ever let internet fanboy people who are pissed

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:38.400
off that some girl likes to yell at them once in a while ever get under your skin, because

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:45.760
I know it was hard at first when we first went podcasting, but they suck.

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:48.760
I can't say anything right now, because I'm emo.

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:50.400
Lowkey, do you want to say anything?

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:51.840
I don't know what the hell to say.

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:53.520
I'm not good at this stuff.

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.520
No, it's been fun.

01:02:55.520 --> 01:03:00.520
I like doing the show, and it's just, Nellie doesn't probably like too much that I spend

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:03.320
three hours of my week every week.

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:08.840
Well, mentally probably way too much time on the show.

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:12.760
I mean, my God, I can do stuff at work.

01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:14.000
It's all game related.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.680
It's always game related.

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:17.460
Everything's always game related with me.

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:19.080
Get a life, Lowkey.

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:25.080
Seriously, I think getting married would change everything, but no, it doesn't.

01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:36.400
The only thing I'm focusing on now is just taking the show to the next step, not letting

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:43.040
the other big sites out there bother you with the fact that people take them more seriously

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:47.400
and that kind of stuff, because you either have to have a big financial backing or you

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:50.840
just have to earn the respect for it.

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:53.080
All that comes in time and money.

01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:55.960
I don't know, it's just going to be interesting.

01:03:55.960 --> 01:04:05.720
I have no plans on quitting the show, so however long it goes.

01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:09.600
The first thing that I have to actually say about the show is that if it hadn't been for

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:15.440
you guys, I don't think I would have made it through my diagnosis, because this is what

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:16.440
kept me going.

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:17.440
I had to give up school.

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:18.440
I had to give up a lot of work.

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:20.720
I had to give up my busy life.

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:25.800
But having the show as a constant actually kept me going and everybody writing in with

01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:26.800
the support.

01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:30.760
I have to say that that was a big thing for me, because I've always considered myself

01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:35.880
to be a capable individual and to have that capability sort of get yanked out from under

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:36.880
me.

01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:40.400
Having all the support of our listeners and talking to other people who've had similar

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:43.320
is like, wow.

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:47.440
That's the biggest thing, is having our listeners, having that type of support network.

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:53.840
There's been the people who have, you know, I'm sorry, if you, it was sort of like what

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:59.800
Margaret Cho said about Martha Stewart, she was put in jail for being a bitch.

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:06.080
I feel like I get hate mail for being an outspoken woman, because there's still this vast majority

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:10.720
of, and no offense to any of our guys listening, there's still this vast majority of men out

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:14.880
there who think that just because they have a cock, they can tell women what to do.

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:19.600
Well, I think G4 fucked a lot of that for everybody, for girls everywhere, because a

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:24.440
lot of girl gamers on that shit, girl gamers, quote unquote, are just a set of tits.

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:27.320
And Dark Sakura is so much more than just a nice set of tits.

01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:29.160
Although they are nice.

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:33.960
They are nice tits, don't get me wrong, but there's just much more than that.

01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:43.700
But, you know, it's, it's, it actually gave, doing this show just from, even from getting

01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:48.600
under sedation, because it was you and Jessica, that, you know, Rob and Jessica.

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:52.720
Speaking of a nice set of tits, she was, she was wonderful too.

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:56.960
I have to say thank you to Jessica, because I'll go back to that in a minute.

01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:57.960
Go ahead.

01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:02.460
You guys brought me in on under sedation and I had been just sort of, you know, I've always

01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:07.120
been outspoken for people, but very nervous in large groups, you know, and I really got

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:15.800
me over a lot of my, my shyness, I think that my residual shyness gave me a lot more ability

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:23.160
or I say confidence to really say, you know, tact is one thing, but censoring yourself

01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:28.120
for the sake, you know, censoring the truth, I think, or how you really feel for the sake

01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:34.680
of political correctness or somebody else's retarded sensitivities.

01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:41.060
Doing the show has completely opened up that side of me that has given me courage to stand

01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:47.920
up for myself as a woman, not just to the gaming community, but at work, you know, in

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:55.680
my daily life, you know, I, I feel completely, I mean, doing this, this show has been such

01:06:55.680 --> 01:07:03.440
a confidence booster that, you know, and I think everybody who's, who has supported my

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:11.680
loud mouth, outspoken, bitchy Aries womanliness, I want to thank all of you.

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:15.040
And whoever's king, my Lancer needs to die right now.

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:16.040
Amazing.

01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:17.040
Wow.

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:19.760
Thank you guys so much.

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:25.880
Yes, Drew and Chris, if you guys want to add anything, you don't have to.

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:27.540
Shit, shit, guys.

01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:28.540
It's been a wild ride.

01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:32.100
I mean, I've been with the guys since episode two, you know, we jumped, jumped the shark

01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:36.640
in episode one, apparently, but I've been here for the whole downhill ride.

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:43.400
And I was listening when I was 16, it's kind of funny that this show sort of defined my

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:44.960
adult social life.

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:49.760
I grew up with this show and it's kind of sad and it's kind of cool at the same time

01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:55.680
because for the past few years, this show has been the main constant.

01:07:55.680 --> 01:08:04.560
And I, you know, I go from awkward teen to intern to scapegoat to bad joke master and

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:05.560
you know what?

01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:06.560
I'm still here.

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:11.160
The show is still going strong and I hope, you know, we continue this course for a long

01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:19.080
time to come because this is the best thing on the internet right now, at least my opinion.

01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:20.080
Thank you.

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:21.080
Wow.

01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:22.080
Thanks.

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:23.080
And thank you for being so supportive of us.

01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:24.080
You are a true fan.

01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:27.960
I've always been, you know, one of our number one fans throughout the years.

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:28.960
It's amazing.

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:31.680
Shit, I lost my train of thought.

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:38.120
Oh, I wanted to say about Jessica from Understadation Live, something that I don't know if it's

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:42.920
ever been said, Jessica and I couldn't fucking stand each other the last year that we did

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:45.120
Understadation Live.

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.120
And it's cool.

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:47.120
We're cool now.

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:48.320
I mean, so, you know, it's okay that I say that.

01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:51.600
I couldn't say that a couple of years ago, but I can say it now, Jessica and I cannot

01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:52.600
fucking stand each other.

01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:55.240
I mean, it was really hard to do that program.

01:08:55.240 --> 01:09:03.800
So I know from experience that being such good friends with you guys is such a relief.

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:06.560
It makes doing this show so much easier.

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:11.480
And I truly do look forward to having this show every week as being a way that we can,

01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:14.200
you know, hang out with each other because sometimes our lives are so busy we can't do

01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:15.840
it without this constant.

01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:20.680
I do have to say, though, just to your and Jessica's credit, you both hit it very well

01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:22.240
on the air.

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:23.240
It's professional.

01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:28.600
When I saw Chicago, the end of that movie, and if anybody wants to know exactly what

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:32.360
it was like, go watch the end of Chicago, because that's exactly what it was between

01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:33.360
Jessica and I.

01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:34.360
It was like we could have...

01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:36.560
We wanted to kill each other, but it was one of those things where it was like, well, show

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:37.560
business.

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:38.560
We're just going to get out there and do it.

01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:39.560
Yeah, we...

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:42.760
Yes, to her credit, she was very good at hiding it.

01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:46.240
And there was even one episode where we had to fake that...

01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:47.320
It was an April Fool's thing.

01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:51.920
We had to fake that Travis left, and Jessica and I took over the show, and you would have

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:53.780
never known that Jessica and I...

01:09:53.780 --> 01:09:56.800
That was right after Jessica and I were about ready to kill each other, when everything

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:57.800
went down.

01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:00.920
That episode was right after that, so it was something else.

01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:04.920
I just remember listening to that episode and sitting at my computer about to bawl,

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:07.280
because you know what my position was in between that.

01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:10.280
Chris, did you want to say anything?

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:11.760
I don't know how much I can contribute.

01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:14.280
I'm kind of a new listener, so...

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:15.280
Newbies?

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:16.520
Yeah, newbies.

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:20.160
I'm a noob.

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:24.640
I actually met you, Rob, the first time when we saw Silent Hill.

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:32.840
That was the first time I met you, and I listened to a podcast right before that, and I've never

01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:35.200
really been into video games.

01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:39.640
I mean, I like video games, but I'm one of those people that is really interested in

01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:44.640
something, but has absolutely no idea what you guys are talking about.

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:51.400
So it's been very educational listening to you guys, and I just didn't know about the

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:53.640
Wii until you guys talked about it.

01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:56.200
So all my gaming news I pretty much get from you guys.

01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:57.200
That's hardcore.

01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:59.080
Yeah, it's really hardcore.

01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:04.120
But it's just nice to make friends, because I don't have a lot of friends, actually.

01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:05.120
Aww, we love you.

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:06.120
A chatroom loves you, too.

01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:07.120
You know they love you.

01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:08.120
I love...

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:09.120
Yeah.

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:10.720
And just for the record, Chris also has a very nice set of tits.

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:13.880
I know it's radio, so you guys can't see.

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:14.880
He's lying.

01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:15.880
No, I'm not.

01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:16.880
No, I'm not.

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:17.880
No, I'm not.

01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:19.280
No, I'm being realistic.

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:22.360
I am normal, average.

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:23.360
Thank you, Robbo.

01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:24.360
Stop.

01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:25.360
Stop.

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:26.360
Shut up, Robbo.

01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:27.360
All right.

01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:30.360
We have one more person that has a speech.

01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:31.360
Okay.

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:35.760
BlackWolf in our chatroom says, and you know, guesting on OLR was a highlight of my podcasting

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:36.760
career.

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:41.200
You sappy bitch, you've got a great podcast.

01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:47.920
He's done 50 himself, and he's done Dragon Con, I mean, he's done cons bigger than we

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:48.920
have.

01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:49.920
Don't get sappy.

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:52.920
I don't know if it's the champagne, but I do feel a little weepy.

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:53.920
Do you have another glass?

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:54.920
All right.

01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:55.920
Go ahead.

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:56.920
All right, look.

01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:57.920
Here's the thing.

01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:03.920
Let's turn this show around and start to end this thing on a positive note, because for

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:04.920
a long...

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:05.920
I thought we ended on a high note.

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:06.920
Look, for a long...

01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:11.860
We actually are going to be ending on a bit of a high note, but I ain't singing it.

01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:13.200
Here's the deal.

01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:20.240
There's been a moment in Orange Lounge Radio's history that people, for whatever reason,

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:24.080
just seem to love and have never shut up about since the night it happened.

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:30.520
The night it happened was November 16th, 2003, and I think it went down in a lot of people's

01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:33.440
minds in Orange Lounge Radio's history.

01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:34.440
Here's the weird thing.

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:36.640
Jamie wasn't even there that night when this happened.

01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:38.920
I was staying in the Harry Potter room in the gay frat house.

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:47.040
And folks have been begging and begging to please post this somewhere so I can download

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:48.040
it.

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:49.040
No!

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:53.400
So here it is, boys and girls, on this special 200th podcast.

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:57.560
A little clip from episode 69 of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:00.160
Loki plays karaoke revolution.

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:01.160
Wait.

01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:07.720
I just have to say, the sound quality sucks because we were on dial-up back then, okay?

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:09.720
So just bear with us.

01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:18.600
Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:22.560
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:30.160
All right, we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and as promised, we're now going to

01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:33.640
show off our karaoke talents in a round of karaoke revolution.

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:37.640
Say it again.

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:39.640
I'm singing.

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:40.640
I'm...

01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:42.640
I'm not gay.

01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:44.640
I'm singing.

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:48.640
I'm happy with my friend.

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:50.640
I'm singing.

01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:55.640
I want the world to know.

01:13:55.640 --> 01:14:00.640
I'm happy with pussy.

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:03.640
I'm singing.

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:06.640
I want the world to know.

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:10.640
Got the night in show.

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:15.640
There's a new me singing.

01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:17.640
He's laughing.

01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:20.640
I'm completely happy.

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:25.640
Stop making me laugh, Kermit, like you never knew it.

01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:28.640
I'll make it through.

01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:32.640
The time has come for me, breaking out of the shell.

01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:36.640
I have to shout that I'm staying in.

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:39.640
I'm staying in.

01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:41.640
I want the world to know.

01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:45.640
I'm happy with the pussy.

01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:47.640
I'm staying in.

01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:50.640
I want the world to know.

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:54.640
I shop on the same side of the street.

01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:56.640
I got to show the world.

01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:58.640
Yeah, I'm on the scene.

01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:00.640
All my abilities.

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:02.640
There's so much for me.

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:05.640
Somehow I have to make them.

01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:07.640
Just don't understand.

01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:09.640
I've got it all in hand.

01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:12.640
Oh, how I've got it planned.

01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:14.640
I'm spreading the love.

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:16.640
There's more for me to fear.

01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:18.640
And I just feel so good.

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:20.640
Every time I hear.

01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:23.640
I'm staying in.

01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:25.640
I'm happy with the females.

01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:29.640
Got to let it show.

01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:31.640
I'm actually causing this song.

01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:34.640
That's pretty amazing, I think.

01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:40.640
Since I can't sing worth a shit.

01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:41.640
Oh, yeah.

01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:42.640
Play that instant mental soul.

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:43.640
Oh, yeah.

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:48.640
Oh, yeah.

01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:55.640
Yeah, work in the crowd.

01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:57.640
Yeah.

01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:58.640
Yeah.

01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:00.640
There's my pictures in the crowd.

01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:04.640
Fuck yeah.

01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:06.640
I'm coming in.

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:09.640
I want the world to know.

01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:13.640
Got to let it show.

01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:15.640
I'm staying in.

01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:17.640
I'm happy with hetero.

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:21.640
Just want everyone to know.

01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:24.640
I'm staying in.

01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:26.640
I want the world to know.

01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:30.640
Women are my thing.

01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:33.640
I'm staying in.

01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:34.640
I'm sick of this song.

01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:38.640
You're going to really die.

01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:40.640
God, this is long.

01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:43.640
It just doesn't fucking end.

01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:47.640
Just keeps on going on.

01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:50.640
I'm going to kill anyone in the chat room that has a recording of this.

01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:51.640
You're going to so die.

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:53.640
I know where you live.

01:16:53.640 --> 01:17:00.640
As a reminder, the show will be broadcast this week on Thursday.

01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:03.640
A score of 6,964 points for Loki.

01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:05.640
Not even a gold record.

01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:07.640
There is no justice in this world.

01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:11.640
We're going to shut the game off now.

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:13.640
I have not laughed that hard.

01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:16.640
I laughed so hard I peed.

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:18.640
I peed a little.

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:20.640
I peed a little bit.

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:22.640
I got to hear this when I came back.

01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:24.640
You weren't even there that week.

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:27.640
The girl in there was our original show host, Madam.

01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:30.640
She needs to come back and be on the show soon.

01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:32.640
Loki?

01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:38.640
We'll put him up.

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:41.640
God, our show sounded like shit back then, didn't it?

01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:47.640
You know what? We should have never been a dial-up friendly station.

01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:54.640
I have both recordings already edited out.

01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:57.640
I'm not sure if they were recorded on my computer at the time.

01:17:57.640 --> 01:17:59.640
I think they were edited out of the show.

01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:00.640
Loki is going to kill me.

01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:01.640
I have the deep, dark secret.

01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:03.640
I was the one who distributed that.

01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:05.640
Whatever. I don't care.

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:08.640
Here's the thing. Episode 300 we have is complicated.

01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:10.640
But until then...

01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:12.640
No, now listen.

01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:14.640
Here's what we'll do.

01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:17.640
The MP3 is on the MySpace page.

01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:19.640
We've been getting kind of stale.

01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:21.640
We'll put both of them up.

01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:23.640
We'll see what we can do.

01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:26.640
I thought you sounded okay.

01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:29.640
You should have heard complicated.

01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:31.640
Maybe pick a random song.

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:33.640
Avril Lavigne is complicated?

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:35.640
Now that's sexy.

01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:38.640
Alright guys, I really do not like Karaoke Revolution.

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:40.640
We will be back here next week.

01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:44.640
As always, Sunday night, September 24th, 2006

01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:48.640
with Orange Launch Radio episode number 201.

01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:51.640
Same old shit, different week.

01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:53.640
DDR Sneak Peaks continue next week.

01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:57.640
Hoping to have an interview next week with a very interesting independent product.

01:18:57.640 --> 01:18:59.640
I'm looking forward to getting more on that.

01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:03.640
But for now, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:06.640
Drew Nami, thanks so much for being here again this week.

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:07.640
What's your final thought?

01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:10.640
Be excellent to each other.

01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:12.640
Chris, what's your final thought?

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:13.640
Party on, dudes!

01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:14.640
Chris, your final thought?

01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:16.640
Party time! Excellent!

01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:18.640
I have no final thought.

01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:19.640
My brain is dead.

01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:21.640
But happy 200, guys.

01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:22.640
Thank you.

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:23.640
It's awesome.

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:26.640
Enjoy your fat-causing product of chocolate.

01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:31.640
My final thought is peanut butter.

01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:32.640
Loki.

01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:36.640
Would I say jelly time?

01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:40.640
Let's see here.

01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:43.640
What the fuck are you doing?

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:49.640
I think the living room was inspired by us.

01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:51.640
They're playing Comcast Karaoke right now.

01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:52.640
They were playing that before.

01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:58.640
No, but you might see another show come back, maybe.

01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:00.640
I'm not going to make any promises.

01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:02.640
Dark Sakura, your final thought?

01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:04.640
I have to always say reject false icons.

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:06.640
It is episode 200.

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:08.640
The photo says buck futter.

01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:10.640
Buck futter?

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:16.640
I read that and I was singing of that Chiba Mato song, Butterfucker.

01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:20.640
I was singing that in my car.

01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:27.640
But I'm full of emotional happy right now and cake.

01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:32.640
Oh, stop taking my foot!

01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:38.640
As always, thank you guys for supporting independent radio for the past 200 weeks.

01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:40.640
You guys are awesome.

01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:45.640
And we can't wait to start all over next week with Orange Lounge Radio episode number 201.

01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:52.640
Until then, this is Rob Roberts for Dark Sakura, Loki, Junami, and Chris saying see you next week.

01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:23.640
Thanks for watching!
