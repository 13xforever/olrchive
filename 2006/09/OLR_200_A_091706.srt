Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Attention!

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Mani Talk and then some.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Orange Lounge may contain adult content. Orange Lounge may contain many four letter words.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity. Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Just kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex in this episode.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The last Metroid is in captivity. The galaxy is at peace.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted and mildly retarded content.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yes, I will spank your child. If you're not going to do your job, God damn it, I will.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Oh wait, most children already are evil little demons from hell.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Now you see that evil will always triumph because good is dumb.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Fact, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life, sir.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
He jeopardizes my ability to effectively govern this student body.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Well, it makes you look like an ass is what he does, Ed.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Samburgers, the cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That was huge. Cool.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Do you mind if I take my new car for a ride?

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Catherine, the only thing you're going to be riding is me.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Have you seen Mountain Dew?

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Lena, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my underground lair.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So it was you. I was going to expose you.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I know. So I choose to expose myself.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Please, there are ladies present.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Dark Sakura.

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Oh my God, I see a bloody stump!

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Sky. Anytime in the place, baby.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Loki. Ow, my foot! Why did I shoot myself in my foot?

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We are live, and this is episode number 200 for this September the 17th of 2006.

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You're listening to the Bemani Scene's most ancient podcast and radio station of all things Bemani.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But as of about a year ago, all things video games, tonight is a very special show, boys and girls.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yes, that intro was specially made just for tonight. Hope you enjoyed it.

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Oh my God, there's fire in here right now.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Chris has surprised us with her presence, and she's brought us a cake with a big 200 on it.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Wait, hold on, hold on. I have to take a picture on my cell phone so we have something for the site.

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Rob, have I told you lately that I love you for that intro?

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I just want to...

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I forgot about the bloody stump.

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I just want to warn people, if this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge...

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Oh my God, you almost dropped that fucking cake.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I just want to warn you guys, if this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio, tonight is going to be a really fucked up episode.

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We are celebrating our 200th episode. We have a lot of surprises in store, and I guess this is one of them.

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I had no idea we had a cake coming.

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Okay, Loki, Dark Soccer, we have to all blow out the candles together.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Look out, they're going to blow.

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Look out, we're going to blow.

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Oh, this is so cute. I took a picture, we'll put it up on the website later.

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What are we wishing for?

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
One, two, three.

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yay!

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We blew them all out, it comes true.

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
All right.

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Thank you guys so much, this is awesome.

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Wow.

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Well, my name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only...

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I was trying to reinvoke the old intro there, but that threw me off.

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So much for that.

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's cake pie.

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Cake pie!

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Say hello to the...

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Another surprise, I got another surprise.

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Oh my God, I got a...

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What?

74
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
This is just craziness, I just got a T.R. that says over the hill and Loki has one too.

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That's great.

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And Jamie has one too.

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Oh my God, you guys are too much.

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Oh, you guys, thank you.

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Okay.

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Happy happy birthday from the internet to you.

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
We wish it was our birthday so we could party too.

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Hey, happy happy birthday, all your gamer dreams come true.

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Happy happy birthday from all of us to you.

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Happy happy birthday.

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Oh my God.

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I don't know if I'm going to be able to do tonight's show.

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Alright, say hello to the one and only...

88
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Happiest bunny on the farm is Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Who found the ferret?

90
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I found the ferret!

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Woo!

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Woo, ferret!

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Oh my God.

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Say hello to Tech Masa Loki.

95
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
There's a lot of people in here that need less caffeine and sugar.

96
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
That's alright.

97
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And say hello to Drew Nami who's here with us as he has been a lot lately.

98
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Who needs to learn to put the microphone next to his mouth?

99
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Definitely one person needs more caffeine, damn.

100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Alright.

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Alright, say hello as well to Chris who's brought us all these wonderful surprises.

102
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Thank you, Chris.

103
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Oh, that's okay, I thought of it up as Jamie and I were eating lunch and I said,

104
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You know what? I should bring donuts. You know what? Fuck that.

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's their special birthday. We need something better.

106
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So we thought we'd get the carbiest, most sugariest thing we could find,

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
which has a very rainbow-y happy birthday to it.

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
This is so awesome.

109
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Our cake is so gay.

110
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
The surprises are just beginning, you guys, tonight.

111
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
We have a lot of crap in store tonight.

112
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Even the chat room doesn't know about some of the stuff we got planned.

113
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's going to be a very interesting show.

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
We have cake pie.

115
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
We're going to get to cake.

116
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
But first, and we do have DDR Sneak Peaks continuing tonight,

117
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
a very special edition of the DDR Sneak Peaks.

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And it was confirmed, the ferret is gay.

119
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
We have our gay ferret.

120
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Alright, let's try to get some gaming news out of our system

121
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
because we have a lot, a lot, a lot of it this week.

122
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So first off, we start off every show.

123
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
How was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?

124
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
My gaming week was actually still more pinball.

125
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
We got another pinball machine.

126
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Another one.

127
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
We have a Guns N' Roses pinball.

128
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
My God, you guys are nuts.

129
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
We're working on it right now.

130
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And I played some more Mario.

131
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, that's it.

132
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Alright.

133
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

134
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Oh, I watched some porn too.

135
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Congratulations.

136
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And I got some Yowie now.

137
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I thought you said, how was your gaming week?

138
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I don't know if that would be considered gaming.

139
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I consider it fun.

140
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You could play the Yowie drinking game.

141
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I streamed HD porn to my 360, so does that count?

142
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I was, I was there when you did that.

143
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Tell everyone, do I get to lick the frosting off the candle?

144
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yes.

145
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Well, actually, I had another one too that we downloaded

146
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
that we streamed off my wonderful laptop here

147
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
because it has Media Center Edition on it.

148
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But, no, yeah, you can stream stuff with Media Accenter,

149
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Media Center Accenter.

150
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And, unfortunately, well, actually, fortunately,

151
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
the only thing that we had to test it with is porno.

152
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So we streamed, you know, 720p porno.

153
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And the only thing we had to test with was porno.

154
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So, yeah.

155
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So we did that and it is very crisp.

156
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Very, very crisp.

157
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The only thing I'm disappointed with...

158
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I actually saw it too and I will never see a clearer muff

159
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
in my entire life.

160
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The only thing that's bad about it though,

161
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
and I don't know if, I couldn't stream it with like Dolby

162
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
or anything like that.

163
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
That would be really cool if I could do that.

164
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But, you know, whatever, it's cool.

165
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So we did that.

166
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So actual gaming stuff, I actually played some stuff

167
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
including, and I don't know why,

168
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I got it for free from work, Bomberman Act Zero,

169
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
and it started off pretty fun,

170
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
but the whole thing, it's really sad

171
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
that the game fails by things that I would think

172
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
that would be really easy for the devs to either fix

173
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
or, I don't know, figure out that they were wrong

174
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
in the first place.

175
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The first thing, of course, being the fact

176
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
that you can't save at all.

177
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So if you were to beat the game,

178
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
you had to play through 99 levels straight.

179
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
By the way, only one kill, or one hit and you're dead

180
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
and you have to go all the way back to one,

181
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
so that kind of sucks.

182
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
There's no live system or anything like that.

183
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
That's really kind of the only thing

184
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
that detracts you from the whole game.

185
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
That and the fact that the camera angles

186
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
and everything like that.

187
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So, I don't know, it gets annoying,

188
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
but it's still Bomberman.

189
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's pretty fun, but, you know,

190
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I wouldn't have paid money for it,

191
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
so thank God I didn't have to.

192
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Then I played a lot of Xbox Live Arcade stuff.

193
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I accidentally downloaded Time Pilot

194
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
because I meant to download Scramble,

195
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
so I ended up downloading them both,

196
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
and to be honest, Scramble's kind of lame

197
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
and so is Time Pilot.

198
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Konami, you need to really make some better games

199
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
to put them out on live.

200
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Also, maybe make your games, I don't know, widescreen.

201
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I mean, seriously, if they remade it

202
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
for the graphics and stuff,

203
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
why didn't they just add widescreen support to it?

204
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I don't know, that wouldn't be that difficult.

205
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You get pretty borders on the left

206
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
and right side of the screen.

207
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Same borders are in every Konami arcade game.

208
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Anyways, so I played those.

209
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I played a little bit more Geometry Wars.

210
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I played multiplayer on Marvel Blast,

211
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
which was kind of lame.

212
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I played multiplayer on Marvel Blast

213
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
because every time you start a multiplayer game,

214
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
you're in the middle of someone else's game,

215
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
so there's no possible way for you to win

216
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
because they're like 75 points ahead of you.

217
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Well, wait until the game's over

218
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
and then they start a new game.

219
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
That's fine, but that doesn't always happen.

220
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
That's kind of lame, but whatever.

221
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What else did I play?

222
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
More Grand Theft Auto, of course.

223
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Actually, I emailed Rockstar

224
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
about Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories

225
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
because we do play it so much

226
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
and we were bragging, or I was bragging to them

227
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
that I probably played it more than the devs did,

228
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
and I think I probably did

229
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
since it doesn't seem like they played it much.

230
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And then, yeah, so hopefully I'll hear back from them

231
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
because I want to know how their multiplayer's

232
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
coming for that game because they better not fuck it up

233
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
or I will fly down there and beat them to death.

234
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Anything else?

235
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Oh, I played Mario Kart on the DS

236
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
while I was waiting for my dad for a movie today.

237
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Fun? I played bow mode, and I don't like the bow movement.

238
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
All right, I'm going to our chat room,

239
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
which of course is always one of our other guests,

240
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
www.orangesonshady.com.

241
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Oh, I'm sorry, and I played Chrome Helms in multiplayer.

242
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And got your ass kicked from what I hear.

243
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Well, that's because my mic sucks.

244
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm looking at our chat room.

245
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
In fact, so many people in chat tonight,

246
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
the names are scrolling off the screen.

247
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
We can't see.

248
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Anyway, I want to point out,

249
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Robert M. in chat says,

250
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
when did you see Jairus on live?

251
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's coming. We know it's coming.

252
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's been previously announced.

253
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
When? Couldn't tell you,

254
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
but that's one I'm looking forward to as well.

255
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I love Jairus. Awesome game.

256
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
My gaming week.

257
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I actually played a lot of different games.

258
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'll stick to the new stuff, though.

259
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I played Scramble, even though I said on the show

260
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I wasn't going to. I couldn't help it.

261
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I downloaded it. I like the new art style,

262
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
which I thought is kind of interesting.

263
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
But the game itself is kind of anti-climatic.

264
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
The stages are so short, and each one of the stages

265
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
has some type of little niche to it.

266
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Like, oh, stage three is where they're going to throw fireballs at you.

267
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Oh, stage four is where you have to take...

268
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I don't like stage two. It's stupid.

269
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I don't know what the fuck it is.

270
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
The little asteroid things are pissing me off.

271
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
But, okay, the game's from 81.

272
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
What can you expect?

273
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I mean, it's obviously an old, old game,

274
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
but I would have just rather that effort

275
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
that they took porting Scramble be spent on like Gradius,

276
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
which is a far superior shooter.

277
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It will not let me shoot as fast as I want to.

278
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You know the trick? This is what I do.

279
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I put the controller down, and I tap the buttons

280
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
like my fingers are running between bullet bomb,

281
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
bullet bomb, bullet bomb, and I do that really fast,

282
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
and that's how I get all the way through stage four, at least.

283
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Because stage five, the trick is you have to maneuver around

284
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
really quickly, and it's kind of hard.

285
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Since that ship is like a boat.

286
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So, anyway, we have done Scramble, and it's okay.

287
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I mean, if you like the classics,

288
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
the upgrade was actually one of the nicer upgrades.

289
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
The graphics do look really well,

290
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
and the sound's been done a lot better.

291
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
But the game itself, I just can't recommend it

292
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
when it's put next to five dollar games

293
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
such as, you know, Geometry Wars,

294
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
and hell, even something like Frogger or Time Pilot

295
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
was a better buy than Scramble.

296
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm sorry to say I wish they would put effort

297
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
into better games, but that's just me.

298
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The other game I played was surprisingly pleasant.

299
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I played Test Drive Unlimited,

300
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
which I actually enjoyed quite a bit.

301
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
The gameplay is a lot like it reminded me

302
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
of Need for Speed Underground,

303
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
and so you're probably thinking to yourself,

304
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
okay, why do I need yet another racer on the Xbox 360?

305
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
What makes this so special?

306
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Well, Test Drive Unlimited is massive.

307
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You are literally driving around the entire island of Oahu,

308
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
and it's not, you know, 100% geographically correct,

309
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
but for folks who've never been there like me,

310
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
it's got that illusion of that it does seem to be pretty,

311
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
you know, right on to what it's probably

312
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
really like in that environment.

313
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And you drive around and you do different races,

314
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
like you stop at different intersections and do races,

315
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
or you pick up hookers and take them to the shopping place

316
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
they need to go, or you drive cars, hitchhikers,

317
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
lots of different types of quests and things you can do.

318
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's a questing driving game.

319
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
But the other weird thing about it

320
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
that's getting this game a lot of notoriety

321
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
is that even when you're playing in single-player mode,

322
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
if you're playing on Xbox Live,

323
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
some of the dummy cars that you usually see driving in traffic

324
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
are actually other players.

325
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And you'll see their Xbox Live name,

326
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
they are playing single mode as well.

327
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
So it's kind of like an MMO, but not really.

328
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It's the weirdest concept.

329
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
That is exactly why I can't get that game,

330
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
because I'd be such a jackass.

331
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'd be like, attack!

332
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'll tell you what though, I love the idea,

333
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
and I think it's great that they're doing this

334
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
to make the game different than other racing games,

335
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
but I don't know.

336
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I find when I'm racing around,

337
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I don't really run into other people

338
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
right next to them very often.

339
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I've driven by maybe three people.

340
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Supposedly you're supposed to crash into them

341
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
and start a race, but sometimes they drive by so fast

342
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
you don't even realize that somebody went by.

343
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I guess that's what you have to do.

344
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's interesting. It's an interesting concept.

345
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'll have to play the game a little more

346
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
to see how it's fully enabled.

347
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I just joined the oil army clan.

348
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Thanks to Rob Way, he created the oil army clan on the game,

349
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
so I just joined that.

350
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Look for that if you're on Test Drive,

351
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
and hopefully you'll be able to experience more

352
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
of what multiplayer has to offer.

353
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Speaking of the oil army,

354
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm going to be releasing the general design

355
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
for the t-shirts for anybody who wants to make one

356
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
until we can get the ability to put them up.

357
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
We should register our numbers though.

358
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
How are our numbers?

359
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Awesome. The other quick thing I wanted to say

360
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
about Test Drive Unlimited is I was kind of bummed out

361
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
that some of the multiplayer races, at least none of the ones I drove by,

362
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
were restricted by car class,

363
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
because I got the game about a week after it came out

364
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
and by the time I'm ready to do multiplayer races

365
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
everybody in there has a souped-up, maximum, top-of-the-line car,

366
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
so I would have liked to have seen some multiplayer races

367
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
that were restricted a little more by the class car

368
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
so you could have beginner multiplayer races, intermediate,

369
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
and not everybody's just kicking my ass

370
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
because they have a top-of-the-line car

371
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,000
because they've been playing longer.

372
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
That was my thought.

373
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I do recommend Test Drive Unlimited

374
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
if you're a fan of driving games,

375
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
and I think even if you're not a fan of driving games,

376
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
rent it, check it out, because you might...

377
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I mean, it's a good deal, 40 bucks.

378
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's cheaper than the usual Xbox 360 game,

379
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
so it's hard for me to ignore that as well,

380
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
being a big factor in why I would recommend this game

381
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
for you to pick up.

382
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Plus, it's fun driving a Lamborghini off-road.

383
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It is, but the cops get annoying.

384
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
They get really annoying.

385
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I wish there was a way you could turn them off.

386
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
No, it's funny, but the cops, they can't follow you off-road.

387
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Oh, really? I didn't realize that.

388
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
No, they're stupid. They can't figure out how to get off the road,

389
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
so I have to just drive through an unpaved section.

390
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
There's like, duh, where'd he go?

391
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Or just sit in the grass, and they're like,

392
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
oh, I don't know how to get to him.

393
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,000
JeremyTau1 in chat says,

394
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
a friend I know that lives in Hawaii says

395
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
the map is really close to the area, but it isn't perfect.

396
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
He says he can see where he is in the game

397
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
because he knows the roads in person,

398
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
so yeah, it's pretty close to the actual thing.

399
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It's kind of interesting.

400
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,000
All right.

401
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Drunami, how was your gaming week?

402
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Well, not too eventful. I've been leveling a warrior in World of Warcraft.

403
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It's pretty good. I can see where a lot of people say they're Imba,

404
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
but I haven't really got past 18, so that remains to be seen.

405
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I've also been trying to finish Xenosaga episode one,

406
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
or rather, watching it.

407
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I admit, I like it even though it's very, very long on cutscenes,

408
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
and the battle system is sort of frustrating,

409
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
but it's a good game, a very deep story.

410
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Other than that, I haven't really been doing much in the way of gaming.

411
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
All right.

412
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Chris, anything you want to share with how your gaming week's been going?

413
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Well, you remembered me this time.

414
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I did. I'm sorry. How could I forget? You brought me cake.

415
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Meghan says that you're a skanky, skanky hoe bag.

416
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Yeah, I know. No, no, she said Rob is.

417
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Hey, why am I a skanky hoe bag?

418
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
That's her way of saying she loves you.

419
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Oh, okay.

420
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Hugs and kisses and smoothies to you, sweetie.

421
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Okay, aside from Sins 2, I got Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance and Baldur's Gate 2 Dark Alliance.

422
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I found them on Amazon for each, like, 60 bucks, but I got them new.

423
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Did it have a monkey on the cover?

424
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
No, it didn't. Shut up.

425
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I've been playing both of those because I never got to finish both of them.

426
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Go for the eyes.

427
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
So, yeah. I like it.

428
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
That was my gaming week.

429
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
All right. Right on.

430
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And I burned my fingernail, lighting your candles.

431
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Okay, well, I guess now that everybody, now, I didn't miss anyone this week.

432
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Yes, we're good? All right.

433
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I guess we can start, I missed the ferret. My bad.

434
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I guess we can get into some housekeeping news tonight.

435
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
First, if you haven't noticed, it is our 200th episode.

436
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
We're cheating the number a little bit.

437
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
This isn't our 200th podcast, per se, but it's probably well over our 100th regular podcast.

438
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:50,000
But the deal is that we started as a live 365 station back in May of 2002 with our first show airing June 23, 2002.

439
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It was our first live show.

440
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And when we started Orange Launch Radio, originally the concept was we're going to be a DDR station.

441
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
We're going to be about Bomani games.

442
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And we wanted to be the station that was like, we don't want to just talk about the Bomani news,

443
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
but we're going to be like that group of people that's at the diner after playing,

444
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
you know, meeting up at the arcade for a night or like a tournament after DDR tournament

445
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
and just sitting around talking shit, talking about DDR, but talking shit and talking about games as well.

446
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And of course, over the years, we were one of the first internet broadcasts to get on the podcasting bandwagon

447
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
with the first Orange Launch Radio To Go edition debuting in January of 2005.

448
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Keep in mind iTunes didn't support podcasts until June of 2005,

449
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
so we were pretty lucky in discovering that technology pretty early and we started doing a special show there.

450
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And then in January of this year, 2006, we combined our already existing live show and our podcast effort into this,

451
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
our live and podcast show, which runs live every Sunday night and then is podcasted to the world twice a week.

452
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
So we think we're justified in the 200 number because this is about the 200th regular week

453
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
we've been putting out some type of gaming-related programming out there.

454
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Not to mention all the live shows that we've done, special shows and fuck-off shows.

455
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Exactly. We've been live at E3. We were live at Arena this year for E3.

456
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
We were live at the B3 DDR tournament. We were live at a Scandia tournament.

457
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Weren't we live at Milpitas once, Golfland for DDR tournament?

458
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I think we were. Just a bunch of crazy shit we've been doing throughout the years with DDR community.

459
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And now, general gaming as well. We know our fan base has now expanded past just those who are into music games.

460
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And of course, we'll never forget our love of music games. We always have plenty of news.

461
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Of course, we have the DDR sneak peeks tonight. I think that just further goes to show that.

462
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
We haven't forgotten our roots.

463
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Konami finally noticed us like two months ago. It's kind of amazing. So now we have all of that.

464
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
So it's great. We've been so thankful to all the success we've had over the past 200 episodes.

465
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And we don't plan on quitting anytime soon.

466
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
We did also break the Akira Yamaoka tracks.

467
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
That's right. That was one big thing. That was one big thing was that we had a new Akira track that we were playing on the show.

468
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
That was a big thing for us. We interviewed some DDR artists last year. It was pretty awesome.

469
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
So lots of accomplishments. It's really all thanks to you guys in the chat room and the fans. You guys are just awesome.

470
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
But anyway, we're going to save some of the crying and the tears for later in the show because we have a little surprise towards the end.

471
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
So we'll do that a little later.

472
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
For now, the other housekeeping. Now, this isn't such a happy note that we have to get into, but this shit happens.

473
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Part of what we do at Orange Lounge Radio is that we're not afraid to report on things when we hear about it.

474
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
If we sense that there's a bit of legitimacy to a news story, we're going to run with it.

475
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I think we're kind of starting to turn into at least my vision.

476
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
And I think the vision Dark Soccer and Loki have as well is that we want to be like an ain't it cool news of gaming.

477
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
We're not afraid to run the rumors when we sense there's some bit of legitimacy to them.

478
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
And we want to scoop the big, big media reports and things of that nature.

479
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
But unfortunately, once in a while, something's going to happen that causes us to be wrong.

480
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
And unfortunately, this time it happens to be a big one.

481
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And this was a story that was picked up on a lot of news sites that we ran. Loki, what happened?

482
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And this isn't really our fault.

483
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
No, it's not.

484
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
But you guys have to understand, this is what's going to happen when we do this.

485
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Ain't it cool news right all the time? Hell no they're not.

486
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And stuff changes all the time.

487
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It's just like when we report dates and stuff. Dates change all the time.

488
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
But anyways, this is about the Phantasy Star Universe online subscription fees.

489
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Before we reported that the Xbox 360 version would be free and the Playstation 2 and PC would be pay.

490
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Well, Sega went back on what they decided to do and they're deciding to charge for the online service.

491
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And here is exactly why they're doing it.

492
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And this is straight from an email from our sales rep from Sega.

493
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It says, anyways, I just wanted to update you on what's going on regarding the subscription service we have with Phantasy Star Universe.

494
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,000
As you know, the game will have an extensive 40 hour single player mode as well as online questing mode that allows players to create a character,

495
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
customize that character and meet up with other players to complete quests online.

496
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,000
The single player portion is separate from the online mode and it will work as normal on Playstation 2, Xbox 360 and PC.

497
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
The online mode, however, is a bit different.

498
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
To play online, the user will have to create an account with Sega and pay a monthly fee of $9.99.

499
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
This will be required for all versions of the game, including the 360 version.

500
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Previously, we had thought the 360 version would not have a fee due to the Xbox Live fees.

501
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
That has since changed.

502
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
The good news is, this is nothing new for Phantasy Star Universe in that all online versions of Phantasy Star have had this fee in the past

503
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
and that even the last Xbox version which played over live.

504
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Also, we're trying to implement a 14 day free trial for the Playstation 2 version.

505
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Our Japanese dev team has found that this free trial could lead to certain types of cheating

506
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,000
and now there's a chance that that free trial will not be included in the Playstation 2 version.

507
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I will update you as I get final word on this.

508
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Regarding the 360 version, Xbox Live prevents us from doing any type of free trial.

509
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:54,000
However, the good news is that we have a marketplace demo that will allow users to get a small taste of the offline and online portions of the game.

510
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
It says I know subscription fees are not a very common thing for the console games and that's why I wanted to inform you of this.

511
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Well, unfortunate, but Sega told us one thing and then told us another, but as you can understand, you know they were considering it.

512
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,000
They were considering it and I think what it comes down to is that they found out they can charge for it and so they went ahead and did it.

513
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
A lot of negative feedback from chat, people saying they're not going to get the game now because they don't pay for MMOs monthly.

514
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I'm with them on that. I was going to buy the game and to be honest, I'm not really interested anymore.

515
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I'm interested in the marketplace demo. I'm going to make my decision solely based off the demo.

516
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I am encouraged that at least the demo they're going to put on marketplace will support on and offline and that will be the decision maker for me.

517
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I'll pay for MMOs. I paid for World of Warcraft. I paid for Final Fantasy XI. I'm not against paying for MMOs.

518
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
It's got to be good and I want to try it before I buy it.

519
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Here's the thing I don't understand about the MMOs is they have this infrastructure for these MMOs on live supposedly, but yet no one's really using it.

520
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Same with Final Fantasy XI, you have to pay for online service.

521
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I wish there was an MMO that I didn't have to pay for the online portion because that's why I don't buy the games.

522
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I don't have Guild Wars.

523
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:14,000
They don't have Guild Wars on the 360. That's why I don't play MMOs on the 360 because I don't have the time to dedicate to play it regularly.

524
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I don't want to pay this extra monthly fee because I know I'm not going to use it.

525
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Whereas with Phantasy Star I figured, okay, I get to buy it and I can play online whenever I want. Awesome! That sold it for me.

526
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,000
But now this news, right when I saw it I was like, fuck! I knew this was something that was going to possibly happen.

527
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Not a huge surprise since they've been charging all the time, but whatever. Life goes on I guess.

528
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Kind of unfortunate. Jamie, I'm really curious about your thoughts because you're a big Phantasy Star supporter.

529
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I imagine you're probably going to play this anyway, but what do you think about all this back and forth, paying, no paying stuff?

530
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I think half of it is that they're charging because, well, first of all they're in the business to make money, so why shouldn't they charge?

531
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
But regardless, and actually Ronma made this point in the chat room, it's still one of the cheapest MMOs you can play.

532
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I think that if charging the fee might lead to better service, give them more money for development into the game to expand it later on, that's my hope.

533
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
But I really don't care because I was going to play it anyway.

534
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I figured if you want to play something bad enough, no price should keep you from enjoying it.

535
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Alright, well we'll see. We encourage your emails if you want to give us some feedback on this. Mailbag at orangelandtrader.com.

536
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I imagine some people might be kind of pissed at us for reporting the news before, but you know what guys?

537
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
We had certainly a big reason to believe it was true because Sega told us.

538
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:51,000
If you are unhappy with that, sorry. I guess you can stick to getting press releases and things when everybody else gets them and won't know any news beforehand.

539
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
But to Loki's credit, a lot of the rest of that story has turned out to be right on.

540
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:06,000
When it comes to a lot of the stories about the Wii that we're going to get into tonight and the GT steering wheel and some of the other things that you reported in that story are coming true.

541
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:26,000
We can't predict the future. If they go and change what their plan is for something, we're not going to know. It's up to them. So if they decide to go back on what they want to charge, we can't be right all the time when it comes to them changing stuff.

542
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:35,000
As we mentioned, there was a lot of big news this week about this little system coming out from Nintendo called Wii.

543
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,000
We're dedicating just about the rest of the segment to talk about this because there was so much news that came with the Wii.

544
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:55,000
So of course if you've been living in a cave or for some reason you only get your gaming news from OLR, which is kind of cool I guess, here's the deal. The Wii is coming out on November 19th and it's coming out for a price of $250.

545
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
$249.99.

546
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:09,000
With after-tax it's going to be over $250. It's going to be packaged with Wii Sports. Controllers will be sold separately. The Wiimote, which is the official name for it it sounds like, the Wiimote is going to be what?

547
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
The remote and nunchuck.

548
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,000
The Wiimote is going to be $40 and the nunchuck is going to be $20. That was everything that was announced at the press conference.

549
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Pretty much the price point it looks like right now is the remote is going to be $39.99 whereas the attachments are going to be $19.99.

550
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Who called the price? That would be me.

551
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Good job. Now a lot of people are saying the controllers are too damn expensive. But I didn't, I mean okay because when you consider it's the nunchuck and the controller it's going to be about $60.

552
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
You don't have to buy the nunchuck. You do not have to have it. A lot of games do not use it unless it's like a first person shooter.

553
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Plus I do believe isn't a wireless Xbox 360 controller $49?

554
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:01,000
It's $49.99 and that's not even with the rechargeable, granted the Wii does not have a rechargeable battery pack at least as far as I'm aware.

555
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
2 AA's but it does last quite a long time apparently and so I don't know.

556
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I'm not trying to knock Xbox 360's price at all. I'm just saying you know Nintendo doesn't see that but a lot of people were very disappointed in the price that they heard.

557
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
And I thought it was kind of like well isn't that what kind of everyone was expecting? I guess some people have their sights on $200.

558
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
But I don't know I want to say I swear to God I said on this show previously I bet you anything Wii Sports is a pack-in game.

559
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
And people were telling me no because they haven't done a pack-in game in years.

560
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
No Wii Sports is like it's not gamey enough to be a game but it's good enough to be a pack-in game.

561
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
It's just like world class track meet. That's exactly what it is to me. It's world class track meet.

562
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
It's also something that's very simple that will teach you how to use the controller and stuff like that.

563
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Exactly. Alright well we have plenty of Wii news all around the table tonight so.

564
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Well there is a bit more about Wii Sports. Again it is going to be bundled in with the Wii at release.

565
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:04,000
But there's been suggestions especially actually it states that for EGM that it was going to support over 30 different games.

566
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
But the official ones listed are tennis, baseball, golf, bowling and boxing.

567
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:20,000
And it's all pretty much the same simple thing. Like for anyone who watched the press release it's pretty much the same type style of thing that you saw in the press release.

568
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Okay.

569
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I guess bowling is a sport.

570
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Bowling will be kind of fun.

571
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I wonder if it will have curling.

572
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Tennis wasn't bad but again I bet baseball will be a lot of fun with multiple people.

573
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,000
And you know I think the concept and the reason why the remote costs so much and watching the Wii press event and everything.

574
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I think the concept is you're going to build your personality on your Wii remote thing and you want to take it to other places right?

575
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Well actually it's stating that in particular for Wii Sports is that you're going to use your I guess the Wii caricature to play in the games that you can actually play versus people that will personalize the game for you.

576
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
So I don't think that Nintendo wants you to buy four Wiimotes for your household.

577
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,000
They want you and all three of your friends to buy Wiis and then you bring your Wiimote with you like you bring your iPod with you everywhere to share music.

578
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
You're going to bring your Wiimote and I guess I'm also being corrected in chat that's not the real name.

579
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
It's going to be the Wii remote but I don't care it's a Wii remote or Wiimote.

580
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I still like Wecon.

581
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I think they use Wiimote actually.

582
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I swear I heard in that press conference somebody say Wiimote but whatever it doesn't matter.

583
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:32,000
So whatever that thing is the thing you're going to take the thing with you to other people's houses and then you know your characters on there ready to go.

584
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Didn't we already reveal on the show previously in some news article that it had some type of storage on the actual remote itself.

585
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,000
So it probably saves basic stats and things like you know you go to your friend's house and oh hey you're four and two in baseball right now let's play you know.

586
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Sort of be like bringing your memory card with you.

587
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Or your DS.

588
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Yeah I think that's exactly what it is so I don't know.

589
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Anyways well some other interesting things about the Wii in Japan of course which was the first news that we got about the Wii.

590
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:12,000
It's going to be launching for 25,000 yen and what's kind of interesting though is they are not getting the pack in for Wii Sports.

591
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:22,000
That is separate you have to buy that separately and that's actually going to cost around 3,800 actually I'm sorry 3,800 yen is going to be the price of the remote.

592
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:33,000
1,800 for the nunchaku attachment and 1,800 for the classic controller which also by the way $19.99 for the classic controller in the United States.

593
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Wii Sports though is going to be a pretty inexpensive game so that should be pretty interesting.

594
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:48,000
One of the other games I saw in there which is really cool Wii Play which is going to be for people that saw the E3 tech demos and stuff like the shooting demo.

595
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Duck Hunt?

596
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Yeah I like the Duck Hunt game those are in Wii Play some of them so that's kind of cool.

597
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Hopefully we'll get in the states I know that UK is getting and stuff like that but should be interesting.

598
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Camden in our chat room is making a little play on the whole me thing and put me a moto.

599
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:15,000
You remember when you saw the E3 demo with all four of them playing and the little heads were on the bodies and they looked like Miyamoto and everything?

600
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
That was it because they had made their things on the me now it all makes sense so that's kind of interesting.

601
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I just want to ask a quick question.

602
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Why do you think Japan is not getting Wii Sports? Why do you think they opted not to do that and do a cheaper bundle instead without it?

603
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Just for economical reasons I actually stand a chance of making more money having the game separate.

604
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Also Japan is getting theirs on December 2nd which is surprising because they're not the first ones to launch with the Wii the United States is. Interesting.

605
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
We're loved.

606
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Heart Nintendo.

607
00:33:48,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Anyway as far as speaking of the Nintendo love this is in UK news. The Wii is going to retail for 249 euros which is 179 pounds in the UK.

608
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Also with it will be about 20 release games.

609
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:24,000
It's Wii Play, Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess and some third party games like Red Steel, Need for Speed Carbon, Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam, Pixar's Cars and Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz.

610
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
That sounds kind of fun.

611
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Also it will be bundled with Wii Sports as well.

612
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:37,000
It will come with one Wii Remote, one Nunchuk and again Wii Sports.

613
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I think it's funny that they're getting the...

614
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I think it's interesting that Europe is not getting the shaft for once with the release time.

615
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I mean sure we're beating them to it but to be ahead of Japan that's weird to me that Japan isn't getting this thing until December.

616
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
That is so weird to me.

617
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Well actually it says that the European release date is the 8th of December.

618
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Oh my bad. I thought it was before. I'm sorry.

619
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
My bad, my bad. Okay so Europe did get the shaft. Sorry guys.

620
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
It's not that bad.

621
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
It's not as bad as the usual Nintendo shaft. It's not as bad so I guess there's that.

622
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
And I understand why they're doing it because they're launching so many units in the United States.

623
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
They've got to catch up, make sure they have enough for it to launch in the other territories.

624
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Well it's also going to of course, we'll be going into a little bit more about this later, of course we'll have the Wii channel menu and a pretty interesting interface.

625
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Alright. Well if you want to spin your globe all the way around and take a look at Australia.

626
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Australia's launch looks pretty comparable to what Europe's getting.

627
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
The console's going to launch there on December 7th, 2006.

628
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
The retail price will be $399.95 but that's Australian.

629
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
And then they're also going to have Wii Sports as their pack-in game.

630
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
And of course all the other good stuff you've been hearing about with the interface and everything.

631
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Nothing too different there. But Australia's not being left out of the worldwide launch.

632
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:07,000
So it looks like Nintendo has this worldwide launch thing down where Sony with their whole worldwide means Japan and the U.S. only might need to...

633
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Sony just makes it easy to bash on them. I really don't want to.

634
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Well my question for Nintendo is what about Africa?

635
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Where is that only the domain of Sony now?

636
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Africa.

637
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Well maybe we'll hear something on that later, I don't know.

638
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:31,000
We all know that Mr. Kuragis meets crayons and wears a helmet so we can't be too upset at him.

639
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I will be curious to see again, I think like most PlayStation consoles, and I don't want to get off topic too much,

640
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,000
but like most PlayStation consoles, I don't think we'll truly be able to judge the PlayStation 3 until this time next year.

641
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I really don't think we're going to start seeing the big guns until then, but whatever.

642
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I guess it's all about launch now. Now, now, now. Especially in this internet age.

643
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I mean how fast did people want their information on that Wii launch?

644
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Now, now, now. People tuning into June video streams thinking they were current because they had to have it now, now, now

645
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
and something gets dug and then everybody believes it. It's crazy!

646
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
The internet has fucked things up! Totally!

647
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Well, at least we were right about the launch date. We said soon.

648
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Yeah, we did say soon. We did.

649
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I did say November. I gave you a couple weeks in November.

650
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Meg Z got an exact date. I think I should point that out.

651
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I saw her call that on her live journal. That was cool.

652
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
She was really, really happy about that.

653
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I do want to point out, Loki, in your thing you did on 198, you were one of the first people to say, hey, Nintendo is debating launching after Sony.

654
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Because most people, when they were guessing the launch date, were guessing things before the 17th.

655
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
You were one of the first people to say they are thinking about doing it after.

656
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
To be honest, all the dates in our system that we had, all the launch dates were on the 15th of November.

657
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,000
And I was like, that's got to be a to be announced date because there's no way that they would launch it at the same time as Sony.

658
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
And here I was wrong the whole time. It was right in front of my face.

659
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
But, whatever. Who cares? It's just a fun little game until the system actually launches.

660
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Rama in our chat regarding the Wii launch in Africa says, fuck them, send Africa refurbished N64s.

661
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
That's not nice. Have Ellen give out some Wiis.

662
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Have Ellen give out some Wiis to Africa.

663
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I hate Ellen.

664
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
We'll send Sudan Summers there with food for the starving children and Wiis.

665
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
You guys, she gave away to a blind guy. What the hell is he going to do with that?

666
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,000
There's lots of areas to Africa and I'm sure some of them are waiting and willing for their Wiis. They want it.

667
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I actually did go searching for the date. I could not find it, but I would imagine given that the majority of the world is getting theirs in December, theirs is probably close to the same time.

668
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
If not, then early next year. I'm sure you will have your Wiis soon enough, Africa.

669
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:53,000
As we mentioned before, I believe we talked about this, it came out that the Wii will not support DVD playback.

670
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:01,000
What we were told, of course, before is that they're going to have an add-on little thing for it, kind of like the Xbox did where you'd be able to play DVDs.

671
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Well, they've opted on not doing that at all.

672
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:11,000
In fact, it says Nintendo of America's Vice President of Marketing and Corporate Affairs Perrin Kaplan confirmed to IGN,

673
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Wii today, that its forthcoming Wii console will not play Hollywood DVD movies.

674
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:25,000
The decision to remove the functionality was made in order to deliver the machine at cheaper costs because most people today already own DVD players.

675
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
And to be honest, it makes perfect sense. The GameCube didn't play DVDs and I wasn't sad about it, so who cares?

676
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:38,000
You know what's interesting about this? This is a direct opposite philosophy to what Sony is doing, if you think about it, right?

677
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Because Sony is saying, oh no, you need Blu-ray. We need to put Blu-ray in here because you need your Blu-ray movie playback, because you need to see your movies in 1080.

678
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
You need to do this. Isn't it kind of interesting?

679
00:39:50,000 --> 00:40:00,000
You know what, I think that's very smart because their whole point is gameplay. Making games. Not making, oh, we do all this other crap too.

680
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Well, hold on though.

681
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
How many of us in this room own a DVD player?

682
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Well, we all do. I use my Xbox 360, really. But hold on, hold on though, and I don't want to spoil the interface story that's coming up, but there are things that are in the interface that aren't only strictly games, right?

683
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
So there's a little something extra.

684
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
That is true, but I still think that the focus is on games and should stay that way.

685
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
That's why I think that Sony is shooting themselves in the balls.

686
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I think it's more of a cost of technology thing, where it's like, why pay for the DVD player to be in there? Maybe these other little frills we can add on the technology we already have, but why pay to have the DVD stuff in there?

687
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:43,000
If you want to know who to blame for DVD playback not being in there, it's pretty much Hollywood anyways, because you have to license the DVD playback.

688
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Listen, I didn't catch this. Why did Nintendo tell you there was going to be a dongle and now they didn't?

689
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:57,000
That's because of the licensing for DVD playback. You have to pay for licensing fees, and that's why they charge for that stuff, because it covers the cost of licensing. That's why Xbox did the same thing.

690
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
It's not because it can't. It's just because, well, you know, it's just not going to. I got you. I got you.

691
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Well, as far as... we are just so Wii-centric today, aren't we?

692
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Well, for this part...

693
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
It's the hugest thing in gaming right now. When we get into Part B, we'll have some non-Wii stuff, but we've got to get this out.

694
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I just said that so that I could use Wii-centric in a sentence.

695
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Cute.

696
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Regarding more Wii games, actually they have announced a Resident Evil game for the Wii titled Biohazard Umbrella Chronicles.

697
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:41,000
It's produced by Masachika Kawata, who was also the one who ported RE4 to PlayStation 2.

698
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I have to make this crack. Resident Evil.

699
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Resident Evil!

700
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Go to hell!

701
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
And take your toilet paper joke book with you.

702
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
It survived for this long.

703
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Resident Evil. God.

704
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Well, Capcom was saying that they were supposed to combine the gaming experience and atmosphere, but involve the Wii control system with it.

705
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:16,000
They're still not leaving any details. It's still saying it's an action game, still is going to use the Wii-con, but they're not really giving any more detail.

706
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:26,000
However, another game that we did get some detail on was Forever Blue, which is a diving game that will be coming out for Wii.

707
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,000
That sounds interesting. I love those little quirky games.

708
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Resident Evil 4 was badass on the GameCube and was really the last kick in the butt that system had in the right direction.

709
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
What do you think? Is Resident Evil Wii going to be like, holy crap, Nintendo's not just cutesy things?

710
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I have a feeling it's going to do that.

711
00:42:48,000 --> 00:43:00,000
There's also another game that was mentioned, Hajime Tano Wii, which means starting out with Wii. It's supposed to be one of the launch titles, and it's supposed to be a bunch of mini-games with the Duck Hunt.

712
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Are you guys getting used to that name now? Wii?

713
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I think it's cute.

714
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I don't know. I think it's the right thing. I think Nintendo's making a lot of smart decisions here. I'll get into it later.

715
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
What was it that I said months ago?

716
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,000
What?

717
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:24,000
The whole point of advertising. When you come up with a name for something, you need something memorable, something that people are going to talk about, something simple, and it fits all three.

718
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:36,000
And boy, the internet would not shut up about Wii. Check any game blog or major gaming site or little gaming site, and it was Wii Wii Wii, unless it was an Xbox or Sony site. It was all about the Wii all this week.

719
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
There is rarely such a thing as bad press. I always say rarely, not ever.

720
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
You know, look at Sony and E3.

721
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:49,000
You get confused about how many people are like, ooh, what's that, or that sounds so weird, let me check it out. I'm curious now. Ooh, Wii.

722
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Interesting. Interesting.

723
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
When you are having fun, you refer to yourself and some other people. Wii.

724
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Interesting. All right. Well, one game I'm sure we're all going to have a lot of fun with on the Wii is the Twilight Princess, Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess, which, by the way, was delayed a little bit on GameCube.

725
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,000
It's not coming out the exact same day as Wii Link. It's coming out, what, December something.

726
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I'm sure Chatham is going to yell it out.

727
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I want to say December 8th for some reason. It sticks out of my mind. I don't know why. Maybe that's because it was the Europe launch. I don't know.

728
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:27,000
But anyway, what's interesting is that there's a pretty big difference between the GameCube version and the Wii version of Twilight Princess, and that is how Link is holding his sword.

729
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Miyamoto stated that Link was initially supposed to have a left-handed sword in the Wii version of Twilight Princess, but he has that in the GameCube version, and they changed it so that he uses a sword in the right hand on the Wii because of the fact that most people are right-handed.

730
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Well, I always thought it was very strange having Link be left-handed anyway, because isn't it in Japan it's sort of a thing where a lot of parents will train their children to be right-handed?

731
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Being left-handed is very, I guess, considered not very normal.

732
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Chat room's all yelling December 11th, by the way. Thank you, chat room.

733
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Why can't they make Tingle less gay, then? If they can teach Link to use the other hand.

734
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Hey, Tingle ain't coming out here. I can say this because I think on gaygamer.net I want to say was the site.

735
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
They're starting a petition right now to get Tingle out over here because right now it's not planned for release over here.

736
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:26,000
The Tingle Adventure, that uber-gay guy in the, well at least we all think he is, in that GameCube Four Swords Adventures.

737
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,000
He flies by on a balloon and goes, ooh, ooh, and drops rupees on you.

738
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Well, he was actually in Wind Waker.

739
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Oh, that's right. All right, thank you. I just remember him from Four Swords.

740
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I'm going to have to import that because I like, um, yeah.

741
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
You like to feel a little Tingle?

742
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
No, I just like, I like the gay.

743
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Anyway, speaking of, no, I'm sorry, not speaking.

744
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,000
The interface for the Wii, we've got some very interesting things going on.

745
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:11,000
There is, excuse me, as I die over here, there is going to be, it's actually based on Opera for their web browser.

746
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:19,000
There's a weather channel, a news channel, and then there's one called Mii Channel, M-I-I for those who haven't got the joke yet.

747
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:29,000
With the Mii Channel, you can use it to customize your avatar, and also your avatar will show up in the various demos.

748
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:39,000
You can actually store everything on your Wii Remote, so you will actually be taking your Wii Remote to other people's houses and play.

749
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Which I've been listening to some other podcasts kind of, you know, not getting that part of it, and I'm just kind of thinking, I'm like, that's the whole trick.

750
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
It's not that you're going to have four controllers in your own house, it's that everybody's going to have their own controller.

751
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,000
The controller is going to be like the, you know, the thing that defines me, and then the Wii is just the box you play the games on.

752
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:09,000
And also the characters, you don't actually have to play as them, they can also populate, you know, say other games, like Animal Crossing or something like that.

753
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Where you can create, you know, characters, like for example, they showed the demo for, where they're creating Samuel L. Jackson.

754
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:37,000
There actually, if anyone is interested, there are videos up on Eurogamer.net, linked over from Eurogamer TV, that give demonstrations of how these various screens and channels are going to work on the Wii.

755
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
So I recommend checking those out.

756
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Very cool. And I know I saw some on Wii.com too.

757
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Oh yeah.

758
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I have some good stuff too.

759
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I want to point out this comment, and I know I'm not supposed to say these words because they were banned, but it's a funny comment.

760
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Sayoran108 in our chatroom says, Tingle gets more guys than G4.

761
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Oh!

762
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
In regards to Tingle.

763
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Eww.

764
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Anyways, alright. As Jamie mentioned earlier, there's a brand new Wii game, which kind of, I guess, roughly translates to My First Wii.

765
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
And the game's actually going to be bundled with a Wiimote.

766
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:24,000
And it will be, yes, My First Wii. Everybody poops!

767
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
No, no, that's translated that wrong. This is starting with Wii.

768
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Starting with Wii.

769
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Starting with Wii, and then you go to poo.

770
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:49,000
So, yeah, it's going to be bundled together with 4800 yen, making it cheaper than a standard controller, which would be 5800 yen.

771
00:48:49,000 --> 00:49:06,000
So that's actually kind of cool. And it's set for the Japanese release on December 2nd, and will include, of course, minigames designed to make players familiar with the Wii remote controls, including pinball, table hockey, and pool.

772
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Simple point-and-click shooting games, and other games that are modeled after the demos shown at E3, including a minigame where you move your Mii caricature around a city block.

773
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
So, interesting.

774
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Now, one thing that the Wii is going to be able to do that is kind of interesting, and it's kind of interesting that Xbox 360 doesn't do this, and I don't know if PlayStation has plans to do this, but that's surfing the web.

775
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:41,000
And I can see where Xbox 360 doesn't do this, because they want you to go use Windows on your PC to go surf the internet, but Nintendo, they don't have a PC stake, so they say,

776
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
fuck that, you're going to surf the web on our system, and they're going to use the Opera browser to do it.

777
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:59,000
But here's the thing, they said during the press conference that users will be downloading the Opera browser with Wii Points, which is kind of their version of money into points into being able to buy stuff on their thing.

778
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:06,000
But the nice thing about it is that actually they're not going to charge for the browser until June of next year.

779
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:14,000
No idea why they're doing it that way. I thought at first when I read this, this meant that the browser wasn't going to be out until June of next year, but that's not what the internet seems to be reporting right now.

780
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
It seems to be saying that, yeah, the Opera browser will be there, and you can download it free, but in June of next year you're going to have to pay for it.

781
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
So, I guess a bonus incentive to early adopters of the Wii?

782
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:34,000
I guess. The other thing too is, I mean, it's probably not that expensive to develop the Opera browser, and since it's normally free anyways, that's probably why they're charging after.

783
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
It's kind of like the whole thing that they did with Texas Hold'em, where it's free for four years.

784
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Yeah, but Texas Hold'em was free for two days. This is going to be free for about seven months.

785
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Well, you know, not a lot of people are going to be really jumping to download the browser.

786
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Because, I mean, if you think about it, to browse the internet, you've really got to have a wireless setup and all that stuff for the Wii.

787
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Well, wait, but isn't the Wii supposed to have the wireless thing built into it, just like your DS, so that all you have to have is a wireless router in your house and it'll go?

788
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Exactly, but still though, not a lot of people have that, I would think.

789
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Do you think people without wireless internet are going to be screwed, or do you think there will be a dongle?

790
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
No, there's going to be a USB type of thing.

791
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Same with the DS.

792
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
That's what I figured.

793
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Well, speaking of things that are screwed up, Monkey Ball.

794
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Okay, Monkey Ball is just one of those crazy games that's out there, and of course, as everyone knows by now, there is Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz that will be out on the Wii.

795
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,000
They're introducing two new characters, one called Yanyan and one called Doctor.

796
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Yanyan is a female monkey, and Yanyan is an older monkey with a past steeped in mystery due to his acute case of amnesia.

797
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Is his name Doctor Sayus?

798
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
It just says Doctor.

799
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:57,000
In my head, I'm a Doctor Who fan girl, so every time I see Doctor, I think, David Tennant? No!

800
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Now I have this image of David Tennant dressed as a monkey in my head. I can't.

801
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
And now I need to wash my brain.

802
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
David Tennant's hot, but anyway.

803
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Okie dokie.

804
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
So is Billy Piper.

805
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Back to the story.

806
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,000
There's also, each of these characters are going to have different strengths and weaknesses.

807
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Things that affect acceleration, speed, jumping, also the weight and size of the ball that they are in is going to affect how it's played.

808
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Actually, you use the ball in different ways. You can flick the remote, you can press a button, different things that you do with the remote are going to affect how the balls move.

809
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:42,000
And there's also a bunch of mini games. It will be out on December 2nd in Japan.

810
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Sorry, the grade schooler in me is using the Wii to make your balls move. It's just too much for me.

811
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Too much for me.

812
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
It will be a launch game in all territories.

813
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I just want to say some chat comments real quick.

814
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Pooeater on the Opera story in our chat room says,

815
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Why would you want the internet on your console which has to run from your computer's internet connection?

816
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I don't know. There's something to be said about multiple browser windows. Maybe mom wants one browsing window and you want one. I don't know.

817
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,000
And also, I mean browsing from your couch and porn! Come on!

818
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Oh, I can't wait to put porn on my Wii.

819
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Ravenstolphin wanted to correct me and say that PlayStation 3 does indeed have a browser in it. Thank you. I couldn't remember.

820
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,000
I figured as much because PSP has one, but I couldn't remember for sure.

821
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Anyway, speaking of the browser, they are testing the online service, or I should say it's rumored that they are beta testing the online service right now.

822
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:41,000
And this, I don't know how reputable this is, but this is according to a poster on the MacRumors forum.

823
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I have problems with that right there.

824
00:53:43,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Anyways, who has fairly reputable history when it comes to Nintendo related information, saying that the beta test is running from September 18th until October 23rd, and the test will be covering the Wii Connect 24, Virtual Console, and other online features.

825
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Right. Okay, so they're beta testing the online service. Great. That's something that they need to do. Since the console is coming out pretty soon.

826
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Yay for MacMan.

827
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
What?

828
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I'm the only Mac fangirl in the house, so I have a Mac.

829
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
No, that's not true. I like Macs. I have a Mac.

830
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
I'm getting my, um, did you see the 24-inch iMacs?

831
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
The bigger the better.

832
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Why do you need them that big?

833
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
For art?

834
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
I'm being told that that's not a rumor and that's the truth, apparently.

835
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
They're the 24-inch widescreen iMac.

836
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Are you compensating for something?

837
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
No, I have no.

838
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
My internet penis knows no bounds.

839
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Moving on, another question that still is up for debate right now, we have not really gotten a clear answer on this story, and it has to do with the region free.

840
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Is the damn thing going to be region free or not?

841
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:08,000
It seems to be that it's America versus the rest of the world, I mean Nintendo of America versus Nintendo of the rest of the world, debating on whether the damn thing is going to be region free or not.

842
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Basically what happened is that, ok, Perrin Kaplan, who is the VP of Marketing and Corporate Affairs, she said that yes, like the Nintendo DS, the Wii is going to be free.

843
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:22,000
But then, I believe some guy from Europe said that it is not going to be region free.

844
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I guess to further say what Perrin was saying is that she was saying, well, first party games will be region free, but we'll leave it up to the third party folks what they want to do.

845
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
What the hell?

846
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,000
GameSpot ran this whole little rumor control thing, hey, we were in that once, about was it true or not.

847
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:45,000
They said that getting answers from Nintendo proved difficult during one of the company's busiest days of the year.

848
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:55,000
However, after a lengthy exchange of cryptic emails, a rep finally confirmed that Kaplan's words regarding regionless first party titles and potentially regionless third party titles was indeed correct.

849
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
The Wii will be region free.

850
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
So Nintendo of America is convinced the damn thing is going to be region free.

851
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
So I don't know why the rest of the world isn't on the same page.

852
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I hope so because I want to get Wii Play and my first Wii.

853
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:13,000
And if something like, you know, Oh and Don comes out for the Wii, damn well I'm going to believe I want that shit.

854
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
But you know what though?

855
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I have a feeling that even if it's not, we're going to get something like what came out on the GameCube.

856
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:28,000
The thing that basically overrode the region thing is swapped out the disk.

857
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
The freeloader.

858
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
The freeloader.

859
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Using little hacks to do it.

860
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Especially if Nintendo is letting you on the internet with their console.

861
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
You know what a huge fucking hole that's going to be, I bet, to hackers.

862
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:50,000
The whole thing about Nintendo is that theirs has been, all of their systems have been the easiest to play imports on.

863
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:56,000
You know, for Super Famicom games all you needed to do was find like an old gyromite.

864
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Not for Super Famicom, but for Famicom you needed an old gyromite and you could plug it in.

865
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Or with the Super Nintendo you break out two little tabs, plug it in.

866
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:13,000
With the Nintendo 64, they sold actually a little tool that you could unscrew and then you pop another tab, put it in.

867
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Theirs were all physical lockouts until they started moving to a digital format.

868
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
And then with that it was still something as easy as loading a code.

869
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
It was like the Dreamcast, how easy that was.

870
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:32,000
And then I have a feeling that even if they go back and it's all region coded, they're still going to have some way to bypass that.

871
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
And I really don't think Nintendo's going to care.

872
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
They haven't cared before, really. Why should they really care?

873
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Bobby Blackwolf's in our chat right now. He does his own show over on AllGames.com.

874
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
I'm sure if you've listened to this show for any length of time you've heard us pimp him before.

875
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,000
He ran the same story on his show tonight, except he was reading Joystiq's version of it.

876
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
And I guess Joystiq talked to Nintendo as well and they told him, no, it's not region free.

877
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,000
So, shit, even with Nintendo of America, they don't know.

878
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
So, we won't know until the damn thing comes out, it sounds like.

879
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:12,000
You know what, though, I'm still really, I can't be too upset about that because there's going to be a way.

880
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Yeah, there'll be a way.

881
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Even if Nintendo doesn't do something, even if we don't have a developer do something, there is going to be some importer on the net,

882
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:27,000
the same people who probably figured out how to do the seven swap trick on the old PlayStation, who will figure out a way to play it.

883
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Well, it's just like the Xbox 360 games, there are some that come out that are region free and then you can import them.

884
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
You just won't know until they come out.

885
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
I guess it's one of those things they didn't think people were going to ask about.

886
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
What do you mean you want games from other regions? What the hell is wrong with you?

887
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
They know there are importers there.

888
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:52,000
I remember paying $125 for the Sailor Moon S fighting game back in 1995.

889
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Because you're fucking sick.

890
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
And I mean that with lots of love.

891
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
This was when it was brand new and I had to pay import fees.

892
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:08,000
And I paid for it and I bought it and I played the hell out of it and sold it back used for $60 after two years.

893
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:15,000
But still, there are people out there who will lay down the money and will do what it takes to get their imports out.

894
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Cool. Anyways, some of the news that was coming out of Japan was actually a huge list of games that they're going to be getting for the Wii.

895
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
I thought there was a lot of stuff that was very interesting in there.

896
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Some of the titles, at least the highlights on there, some to be announced titles for example.

897
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:39,000
There's an action game and an action RPG that's being worked on from software.

898
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:45,000
A baseball game being worked on by Konami Digital Entertainment, so that might be interesting.

899
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Bomberman Land.

900
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Smash Brothers, which of course we knew was coming.

901
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Disaster, also another Nintendo game.

902
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Donkey Kong Tarou Jet Race, which is going to be coming out in 2007.

903
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Dragon Quest Sword.

904
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles The Crystal Bearer from Square Enix.

905
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
A new Fire Emblem game from Nintendo.

906
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
As well as Harry Potter from EA.

907
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Mario Party 8, not a big surprise there.

908
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Mario Strikers Charge, which had been previously announced.

909
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
This one I thought was very interesting.

910
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Music Simulation Game, of course a working title from Konami Digital Entertainment.

911
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
So, very interesting there.

912
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Of course, one of the things I was excited about, Simple Series is coming to the Wii.

913
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
So that's really cool.

914
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:39,000
And of course, The Dog Island by Yukez, which is going to be coming out in 2007.

915
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Super Paper Mario confirmed to be coming out on the Wii, so that's pretty interesting.

916
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:50,000
A soccer game being worked on by Konami Digital Entertainment, maybe winning 11er Pro Evolution.

917
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
And then of course Pac-Man Carnival, sounds like a mini-game type of thing.

918
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:59,000
One Piece Unlimited Adventure, and of course, Wii Music.

919
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,000
I have to ask, what do you think the Konami game is?

920
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
I have a crazy ass theory.

921
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
What do you guys think?

922
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
You know, I don't know.

923
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
I got one more here, I don't know what this translates to.

924
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
You might know this one, Jamie.

925
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:21,000
What's it? Totsugeki Famicom Wars W.

926
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I actually do not know what Totsugeki means.

927
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Maybe someone in the chat knows.

928
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Let me see.

929
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Good job, Drunami!

930
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Yeah, I was thinking, because I was like, that sounds familiar.

931
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
My thought, okay, the Konami music game, just bear with me on this.

932
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Since it's probably something new for the Wii, I would bet this series is cute enough for Nintendo.

933
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I bet it's going to be some twisted form of pop and music.

934
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
But not with a controller like we know it.

935
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
It's going to be like a different type of pop and music.

936
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Theory.

937
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Weird ass theory for me.

938
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
No, theory here.

939
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Motion sensing controller.

940
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Music game.

941
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Drummania.

942
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
You think?

943
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Actually, you know, they did have one of the demos at E3 was a drumming sim.

944
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:14,000
But isn't that Wii music thing supposed to be a separate game with the orchestra and that whole thing from Nintendo?

945
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
I don't think it has a drumming thing on there.

946
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
The Wii music is just the orchestra.

947
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,000
You know, Chatroom seems to think it's Para Para.

948
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
We're not going to get Para Para. The whole Para Para train.

949
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Well, but wait, this isn't for us. It's Japan we're talking about.

950
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I'm saying, Para Para is pretty much dead in Japan.

951
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
It was a fad that lasted for like, what, five years?

952
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Maybe it's something new.

953
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Maybe it's like gongoro dancing or something, I don't know.

954
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Unfortunately, the gongoro did not die with the Para Para.

955
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Mambo gogo?

956
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Mambo gogo would be cool.

957
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
But anyway.

958
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Well, speaking of other games, we have coming out for the Virtual Console, Hudson, who loves us so much.

959
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,000
We'll be bringing 30 titles over for Virtual Console.

960
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Some of them will be available at launch.

961
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
They haven't listed exactly what.

962
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,000
My speculation is we will be probably getting the Adventure Island series.

963
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Probably the various Bomberman's.

964
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Those are two I definitely think are going to be up there.

965
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
And Bonk.

966
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
I think I definitely.

967
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Well, especially if they're doing turbo graphics.

968
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
You cannot have turbo graphics without Bonk.

969
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Or Air Zonk.

970
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Or Air Zonk. That's another good one.

971
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
That's one that Junami suggested.

972
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
But I still want my Adventure Island.

973
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Well, another company is talking about games.

974
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Coming over to the Wii, actually this one kind of leaked out from the ESRB ratings board there.

975
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,000
We've got a listing for a bunch of different Wii titles for the Virtual Console.

976
01:03:51,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Including Alter Beast, Columns, Echo the Dolphin, Golden Axe, Ristar, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Toejam and Earl.

977
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
All of which are getting an E rating.

978
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Oh God, I can't wait to play Toejam and Earl again.

979
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,000
What do you think though about the whole $5, $8, $10 thing?

980
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Do you think that's going to be worth it for those old games?

981
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
They didn't really say where Genesis and Turbo Graphics fits into that though.

982
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:20,000
They just said 500 points for the old games, 800 for the SNES, and 1000 for the later ones.

983
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Nintendo 64.

984
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I do though have to second something that was mentioned in the chat room.

985
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Bob Coffee said we need to get Dracula X.

986
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:36,000
We have to get one of our biggest Nintendo fans on the Skyline right now because he's dying to comment on some of this.

987
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,000
He knows a few things that we don't and we're going to see what we can get out of him here on the show.

988
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
DMN, are you on the line?

989
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Yeah, you got your $20 bills out?

990
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Why, are you going to dance?

991
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Maybe.

992
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Did you dress up for this phone call?

993
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Wait, what?

994
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Did you dress up for this phone call?

995
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
He's dressed sexy for episode 200.

996
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
I'm actually not wearing any clothes right now.

997
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Alright, we got all types of wheeze on tonight's program.

998
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
DMN, I know you're dying to comment on this.

999
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,000
What do you think about all this news this week and now you can actually talk about some of the things you couldn't before I'm sure.

1000
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Yeah, a few things.

1001
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:20,000
One of the things I want to say is this is the most excited I've been for a console launch since about Nintendo 64.

1002
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:31,000
I would agree with that except I would go as far back to say I have not been this excited about a console at launch, keeping those words in mind, at launch since Super Nintendo.

1003
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Yeah, that's another one.

1004
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:47,000
What I want to say about the Wii is having had a chance to dabble playing it a little bit, we did have a little demo thing over the week for all Nintendo employees.

1005
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
It's incredibly fun.

1006
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Elibits looks amazing.

1007
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Got a chance to try a demo of WarioWare which is amazing. It's really fun.

1008
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
What else can I do?

1009
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Madden 07, I got to play a couple plays of that and that may be the most fun anybody will have with a sim sports game ever.

1010
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Are you biased because you're on Reggie's payroll?

1011
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:11,000
No.

1012
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:12,000
No?

1013
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Swear to me?

1014
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,000
I'm getting a 360 at some point. I'm just not getting a PS3.

1015
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
So you're in the Wii 60 camp?

1016
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Yes.

1017
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Fair enough. Well, what else? Anything else you can tell us about the Wii? Maybe? Little bits? Little hints?

1018
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
I'm trying to see what I can-

1019
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
I don't want to get you fired so I understand if no.

1020
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:45,000
There's not really anything else I can talk about because I know just about as much as you guys do in some aspects, but there's some things I can't talk about because of obvious reasons.

1021
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Right.

1022
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
That's about it.

1023
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Okay. Well, that's cool. We'll take your word for it because you've probably seen the Wii more recently than any of the rest of us.

1024
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:04,000
So you actually got hands on with Elibits because I saw it at the Konami thing, but I didn't get to play it really because all the Corp casts were hogging the shit out of it and we weren't really able to get on it.

1025
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,000
I will say right here and now it will be a Katamari Damacy killer.

1026
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Oh, I don't know about that. I don't know about that.

1027
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
We'll put money on that with you, Rob.

1028
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Loki, you saw this too? You think Elibits is the Katamari killer?

1029
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:18,000
I don't think so.

1030
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:19,000
No.

1031
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:20,000
I don't think so.

1032
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
It's fun. It's going to appeal to the same type of people.

1033
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Yeah, I think it's going to appeal to the same crowd, but I don't think it will sell nearly as many copies.

1034
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
No, they do need to release Katamari for it, though.

1035
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:29,000
They do.

1036
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Yeah, it will be interesting.

1037
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
But it won't be the same guy because he said he's not doing any more Katamari.

1038
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
I guess that's true. Who cares?

1039
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Just hoard it.

1040
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
What makes you think that Elibits is a Katamari killer?

1041
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Just how incredibly fun it was. It was easy to just pick up and play. It took me maybe 30 seconds just to get used to what I was doing and it was clockwork from there.

1042
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,000
It felt just as fun as a Katamari game and just as simple.

1043
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Isn't that how most Wii games are designed, though, that you just kind of pick it up and go?

1044
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Yeah. Absolutely.

1045
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Basically, for those who don't know, Elibits is basically a game where, let's say you're playing Half-Life 2 in just a random part of the neighborhood and the only thing you have is the gravity gun.

1046
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
That's pretty much what it is.

1047
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Interesting.

1048
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Will I be able to sell a Wii to my mom?

1049
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
If you want.

1050
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I mean, is this really the type of console that's going to appeal to everyone, you think?

1051
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Oh, absolutely. I've actually been telling my own mother about it who absolutely loves video games and she actually even seemed interested in trying it when I bought it.

1052
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:47,000
So, I think that this is the direction that gaming needs to go. We need to be more part of the game rather than, you know, I don't want top-notch graphics. I don't want incredibly difficult controls. I just want a game I can pick up and play and enjoy and have fun with.

1053
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Okay. Interesting.

1054
01:08:49,000 --> 01:09:00,000
That's why we're not seeing it as much as the 360 and from what Sony's doing, it's just not looking like it.

1055
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Alright. But what do you think might happen with Sony in a year? Because remember, the PlayStation and PlayStation 2 launches, I think, for people who play the same type of games we do, you know, we're not really in the we buy Madden games the day they come out camp.

1056
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:20,000
And granted, there's a great fan base for that and I'm not knocking that if that's what you're into.

1057
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:29,000
But do you think that maybe for us who are more of the, you know, we like to play quirky music games and Japanese RPGs camp, do you think that Sony might win us over in a year?

1058
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Because I truly believe it right now that Sony may be able to schniggle a price drop and some great games in a year that, you know, don't count PS3 out.

1059
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
I'm trying to be as open-minded as possible about this.

1060
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:51,000
I definitely wouldn't count Sony out. It's just the price that's killing them. I think if they release a Final Fantasy and a Kingdom Hearts, yeah, absolutely, those are going to sell PS3s.

1061
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:57,000
I know tons of people who if Kingdom Hearts 3 comes out, they will drop what they're doing and go buy a PS3.

1062
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Chris? Chris is nodding her head. That's me. That's me.

1063
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Alright, DM, we got to let you go because we got to get to our next round of DDR sneak peeks, but thanks so much for calling in. We appreciate it.

1064
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Oh, one more thing. One more thing. While we're talking about the Wii, you all need to listen to Orange Lounge Radio on November the 19th because I will be in studio with a Wii to give to somebody.

1065
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:25,000
And the other thing, I've got, well, since he couldn't share some info about the Wii, I figured I could.

1066
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Why? What do you know that he doesn't, or that he can't share?

1067
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
I have some release dates.

1068
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Oh, insider release dates. This should be interesting. That's awesome. That's a great surprise. So you're going to be here in studio with us November 19th. That's something Loki Dark Soccer didn't even know.

1069
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
I did too. He mentioned it before.

1070
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
I mentioned there was going to be middle.

1071
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Well, so much for surprise, but you're going to be here and giving that away live on air. That should be awesome.

1072
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Yeah, I look forward to it.

1073
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Thanks so much. You're a true fan, DM. We love you.

1074
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Alright, take care guys.

1075
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Bye.

1076
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
What do you know on release dates?

1077
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Well, as we know, there's only really two Nintendo first-party titles that are launching with the Wii in the United States, including Excite Truck and, of course, Zelda Twilight Princess.

1078
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:22,000
However, shortly afterwards, we will be getting the next in first-party games, which will be WarriorWare Smooth Moves, which is coming to us on January 16th, 2007.

1079
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:33,000
The other thing, which is very interesting, as I mentioned before, Sonic the Secret of the Rings, of course, not a launch title, also confirmed by the launch games that were coming out.

1080
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,000
It is in the launch window, I guess, but it's coming out March 7th, 2007.

1081
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:44,000
So lots of big stuff coming from Sega in March, and I'll get to that a little bit later.

1082
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:53,000
And, of course, Super Paper Mario delayed on the GameCube until the 15th of December, possibly on the Wii in the United States. I don't know.

1083
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Kind of foggy on that.

1084
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Interesting. Alright.

1085
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Well, I think that about covers all the Wii news we wanted to do tonight, so now I want to go around to everybody, our guests included, and I want to ask you guys, what do you think now, after all this news?

1086
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Are you sold on the Wii? Were you disappointed with the news you heard this week, or are you happy with the news you heard this week?

1087
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Is Nintendo going to win the next round of the console wars? What do you think? We'll start it off with Drew. Drew Nami, what do you think?

1088
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Well, personally, I've been sold on the Wii since the E3 announcements, but I know there's a lot of anti-Nintendo people out there, but despite all that, I think Nintendo's got the routine down pat.

1089
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Do one thing, do it really well, do it with innovation. I think they're definitely going to score second, if not first, in the console wars for this generation.

1090
01:12:41,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Loki. The only disappointment I have is that it's not coming out sooner. The price is fine, because I figured that's about the price I was going to pay for it anyways, and I know I've got to buy lots of accessories for it, because I take this thing to work, I play with my friends, and I've got to have enough controllers for everybody, because they're broke asses.

1091
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:13,000
So, that's fine. The only thing I'm just worried about is that I want to make sure I get one on launch. That's my only concern right now, and I'm trying to cover my bases with that.

1092
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:36,000
I do like what they've got coming out as far as games and stuff. I think we're going to see a lot of really cool, innovative things with it. I'm very interested to see these Wii channels. I don't really give a crap about the news too much, but some of the stuff is pretty cool, like the photo channel is pretty neat.

1093
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Some quick chat comments, then we'll get Chris's feedback. Knights in our chat says, the two weeks when Gears of War, the PS3, and the Wii come out, I will feel sorry for everyone at GameStop and EB Games.

1094
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Anoush in our chat says, I think Sony is going to make it again, but I have no problem with Nintendo, I'll buy a Wii 2, but Sony comes before Microsoft for me. Chris, what are your thoughts?

1095
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:09,000
I don't really get sold on games or the systems that they come with too easily. It's now in school, but I don't know if I'm going to get one at launch, just because I'm really picky about the games that I do have.

1096
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Just getting the PS2, which is the only one I've got so far, and some Game Boys, but even that, that took Kingdom Hearts to go get. It's got to be a good game for me to go get it, so I probably won't get it at launch, but it sounds really good, and I'm sure you're going to hear me talk about it constantly, so I'll get enough news from it.

1097
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Here's the thing, my big thing about the Wii. The vibe I get from the Wii is the same vibe I get from thinking about playing Castle Crashers, or old arcade games like the 4-player coin-op games. That kind of vibe, where it's fun, you have your friends over, you put some chips on the table or something, you all play a fun game together. That's the kind of vibe I get from it.

1098
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Quick chat comment, then we'll get my thoughts, and then Dark Sakura. Bob Coffee says in our chat, I think Nintendo's got it. Sony's just making too many mistakes. The real battle will be here in North America.

1099
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:33,000
My thoughts, you know, not since the original 8-bit Nintendo has a word penetrated the general population of America to mean video games, such as Xerox means copies, Kleenex means tissue. I do believe what Nintendo is going for with this is that they are going to make Wii the new word for video gaming.

1100
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:43,000
And I think they definitely have the potential to do that. I think they've got enough with this system set up so that, you know, it's going to appeal to everyone. I mean, you can just pick this thing up and go.

1101
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I do know people that are turned off by Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 because it's just, you know, too many buttons, too damn many buttons, too much to do. And I think this is going to be the one that sells it to the families.

1102
01:15:53,000 --> 01:16:03,000
I think for the hardcore of hardcore gamers, there's another battle that's going to be fought there between 360 and PS3. But I think this is what Nintendo wants. Nintendo is trying to go after the casual gamer, and I think they're going to get it.

1103
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:10,000
And I think the Wii, if not going to be number one, is going to be damn close. And I don't think they're going to sit in third place anymore.

1104
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:27,000
But again, and I might be stealing a little bit of Jamie's thunder here, I'm sorry, but I love this quote. I have to say it. A system is only as good as the games that are on it, and if Wii doesn't continue to impress with good, solid games, I don't want to see no lull like we did on the DS.

1105
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:33,000
And it looks like they're trying to avoid that because they have games planned out through March of 2007 that are all pretty solid titles.

1106
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:40,000
But as long as we consistently are getting new games that keep our interest, I think Wii's got the potential to do amazingly.

1107
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Dark Soccer, your thoughts?

1108
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:55,000
First of all, just to go back to what you were saying about Xerox, I remember there being an ad back in the 80s where Xerox would say this is not a generic, please don't use this as a generic.

1109
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Nintendo is on its way to having their entire corporate name being used as a generic term for games, and in terms of business, that hurts them.

1110
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:09,000
So I disagree with that, just after what I've studied in business law.

1111
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:27,000
But I do agree, though, that they have been the big innovators. I wanted a Wii when it was a revolution. There's never been a doubt that if Nintendo puts out a system, I am going to own it.

1112
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Nintendo could put out a cardboard box and call it the Pooh, and I would buy it.

1113
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Jamie, you're gullible. Have I ever told you that?

1114
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:47,000
I am not. If it's Nintendo, it's going to be good. They've always put out quality products.

1115
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Pooh is not good.

1116
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:55,000
It was an example. I didn't mean to buy Pooh.

1117
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,000
All right. Well, those are our opinions. Take them or leave them.

1118
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:03,000
We'd love to hear your opinions as well, not only in our chat room, but at our email bag, mailbag at orangelandrado.com.

1119
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
And we'll be getting to some of those emails in Part B.

1120
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
But for right now, we're going to shift gears here completely.

1121
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,000
We've been running a promotion here on Orange Lounge Radio called the DDR Sneak Peaks.

1122
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:19,000
We're going to take a first look at new tracks that are going to be in DDR UltraMix 4 and DDR Universe.

1123
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Tonight we have a special version of the DDR Sneak Peaks, and tonight we're going to be checking out some of the new power courses.

1124
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Well, at least we're going to check out one. We can only really play one of them in full for you guys because they're kind of long.

1125
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:38,000
But we're going to check out a power course, and it's from the game DDR UltraMix 4 that's going to be out for the Xbox a little later this year.

1126
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:43,000
It is songs that are mixed together, and they will have steps that go with it.

1127
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,000
This is very reminiscent of, for those of you guys that played DDR Solo, any of those games.

1128
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,000
You remember how they had songs that were mixed together and had a custom step set that went with it?

1129
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Well, that's what these are. They're bringing that back in these new games, UltraMix 4 and Universe.

1130
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
And tonight, we're going to debut one of these power courses for you right now.

1131
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:20,000
This one is from DDR UltraMix 4. It is Power Course number 2. It's the Stargaze Mix by DJ Nagi. Enjoy.

1132
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:47,000
And it's from DDR UltraMix 4. It's the Stargaze Mix by DJ Nagi. Enjoy.

1133
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:55,000
I lost a fragment of myself, made me understand what I'd become.

1134
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Falling like I always did, made me take control.

1135
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Found the weakness, losing touch, leaving me to find what I had lost.

1136
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,000
My heartbeat rather found its place.

1137
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Understand me now, listen to the words I'm saying, baby.

1138
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:42,000
I found the ghost, and it keeps me hanging on.

1139
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:54,000
My heartbeat rather found its place, and it keeps me hanging on.

1140
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:23,000
I found the weakness, losing touch, leaving me to find what I had lost.

1141
