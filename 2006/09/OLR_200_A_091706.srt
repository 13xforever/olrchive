24
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:42,802
[SPEAKER_13]: Now you see that evil will always triumph because good is dumb.

25
00:01:43,022 --> 00:01:45,744

92
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:20,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn.

93
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Could he be any more chill, Loki?

94
00:05:42,082 --> 00:05:45,486
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, say hello as well to Chris, who's brought us all these wonderful surprises.

95
00:05:45,506 --> 00:05:46,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Chris.

96
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:47,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's okay.

97
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:50,051
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought of it up as Jamie and I were eating lunch.

98
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:51,012
[SPEAKER_07]: I said, you know what?

99
00:05:51,092 --> 00:05:51,873
[SPEAKER_07]: I should bring donuts.

100
00:05:52,013 --> 00:05:52,313
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

101
00:05:52,534 --> 00:05:52,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck that.

102
00:05:53,334 --> 00:05:54,616
[SPEAKER_07]: It's their special birthday.

103
00:05:54,976 --> 00:05:55,957
[SPEAKER_07]: We need something better.

104
00:05:56,017 --> 00:05:59,862
[SPEAKER_07]: So we thought we'd get the carbiest, most sugariest thing we could find, which has very...

105
00:06:00,462 --> 00:06:01,323
[SPEAKER_07]: DDR Sneak Peeks

106
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:36,228
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's confirmed, the ferret is gay We have our gay ferret Alright, let's try to get some gaming news out of our system Because we had a lot, a lot, a lot of it this week So first off, we start off every show How is your gaming week, DarkSakura?

107
00:06:36,968 --> 00:06:51,197
[SPEAKER_09]: My gaming week was actually still more pinball We got another pinball machine Another one We have a Guns N' Roses pinball My god, you guys are nuts We're working on it right now And I played some more Mario

108
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,256
[SPEAKER_09]: and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and.

109
00:06:54,516 --> 00:06:54,816
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

110
00:06:55,757 --> 00:06:56,797
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

111
00:06:57,197 --> 00:06:58,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

112
00:06:58,098 --> 00:06:59,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I watched some porn, too.

113
00:06:59,478 --> 00:07:00,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, congratulations.

114
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:00,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

115
00:07:01,219 --> 00:07:02,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it head-tired?

116
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,660
[SPEAKER_09]: And I got some yelling now.

117
00:07:05,641 --> 00:07:06,842
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your gaming week?

118
00:07:06,862 --> 00:07:08,662
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that would be considered game.

119
00:07:08,722 --> 00:07:09,763
[SPEAKER_09]: I consider it fun.

120
00:07:11,238 --> 00:07:12,939
[SPEAKER_09]: Well... You can play the Yowie drinking game.

121
00:07:13,359 --> 00:07:17,140
[SPEAKER_04]: I streamed HD porn to my 360, so does that count?

122
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,380
[SPEAKER_05]: I was there when you did that.

123
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell everyone, do I get to lick the frosting off the candle?

124
00:07:20,521 --> 00:07:20,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes!

125
00:07:21,381 --> 00:07:28,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually, I had another one, too, that we downloaded that we streamed off my wonderful laptop here because it has Media Center Edition on it.

126
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:34,366
[SPEAKER_04]: But, no, yeah, you can stream stuff with Media Center Extender and...

127
00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:40,232
[SPEAKER_04]: and unfortunately, well, actually fortunately, the only thing that we had to test it with is porno.

128
00:07:40,412 --> 00:07:44,435
[SPEAKER_04]: So we streamed, you know, 720p porno.

129
00:07:45,476 --> 00:07:47,737
[SPEAKER_04]: And the only thing we had to test with was porno.

130
00:07:49,078 --> 00:07:50,039
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

131
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,381
[SPEAKER_04]: So we did that and it is very crisp.

132
00:07:54,179 --> 00:07:55,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Very, very crisp.

133
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:01,383
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing I'm disappointed with... I actually saw it too, and I will never see a clearer muff in my entire life.

134
00:08:02,183 --> 00:08:09,407
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing that's bad about it though, and I don't know if... I couldn't stream it with like Dolby or anything like that.

135
00:08:09,888 --> 00:08:11,228
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be really cool if I could do that.

136
00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:13,910
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, whatever, it's cool.

137
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:15,631
[SPEAKER_04]: So we did that.

138
00:08:16,411 --> 00:08:23,555
[SPEAKER_04]: So actual gaming stuff, I actually played some stuff, including, and I don't know why, I got it for free from work, Bomberman Act Zero.

139
00:08:24,176 --> 00:08:40,346
[SPEAKER_04]: and it started off pretty fun, but the whole thing, it's really sad that the game fails by things that I would think that would be really easy for the devs to either fix or, I don't know, figure out that they were wrong in the first place.

140
00:08:41,067 --> 00:08:43,028
[SPEAKER_04]: The first thing, of course, being the fact that you don't

141
00:08:43,376 --> 00:08:48,500
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't save at all, so if you were to beat the game, you'd have to play through 99 levels straight.

142
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:54,324
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, only one hit and you're dead, and you have to go all the way back to one, so that kind of sucks.

143
00:08:54,584 --> 00:08:56,506
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no live system or anything like that.

144
00:08:56,926 --> 00:09:01,950
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really kind of the only thing that detracts you from the whole game, that and the fact that the camera angles are kind of confusing sometimes.

145
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:10,676
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know, it gets annoying, but it's still Barman, it's pretty fun, but, you know, I wouldn't have paid money for it, so thank God I didn't have to.

146
00:09:11,706 --> 00:09:12,166
[SPEAKER_04]: XBOX Live Arcade

147
00:09:27,042 --> 00:09:30,143
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to really make some better games to put them out on live.

148
00:09:30,243 --> 00:09:31,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Konami, Gradius, K-Thanks.

149
00:09:32,564 --> 00:09:35,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, maybe make your games, I don't know, widescreen?

150
00:09:35,905 --> 00:09:40,346
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously, if they remade it for the graphics and stuff, why didn't they just add widescreen support to it?

151
00:09:40,526 --> 00:09:42,027
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, that wouldn't be that difficult.

152
00:09:42,647 --> 00:09:45,548
[SPEAKER_04]: You get pretty borders on the left and right side of the screen.

153
00:09:46,368 --> 00:09:48,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Same borders are in every Konami arcade game.

154
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, so I played those.

155
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:52,752
[SPEAKER_04]: I played a little bit more Geometry Wars.

156
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:56,055
[SPEAKER_04]: I played multiplayer on Marble Blast, which was kind of lame.

157
00:09:56,155 --> 00:10:01,179
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like the multiplayer on Marble Blast because every time you start a multiplayer game, you're in the middle of someone else's game.

158
00:10:01,219 --> 00:10:05,042
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's no possible way for you to win because they're like 75 points ahead of you.

159
00:10:05,102 --> 00:10:07,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, wait until the game's over and then they start a new game.

160
00:10:08,265 --> 00:10:10,227
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine, but that doesn't always happen.

161
00:10:10,807 --> 00:10:12,929
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of lame, but whatever.

162
00:10:13,449 --> 00:10:15,631
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what else did I play?

163
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:46,021
[SPEAKER_04]: more Grand Theft Auto of course actually I emailed Rockstar about Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories because we do play it so much and we were bragging or I was bragging to them that I probably played it more than the devs did and I think I probably did since it doesn't seem like they played it much and then yeah so hopefully I'll hear back from them because I want to know how their multiplayer is coming for that game because they better not fuck it up or I will fly down there and beat them to death anything else?

164
00:10:47,187 --> 00:10:51,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, that's... Oh, I play Mario Kart on the DS while I was waiting for my dad for a movie today.

165
00:10:52,948 --> 00:10:53,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Fun.

166
00:10:53,248 --> 00:10:55,669
[SPEAKER_04]: I play Battle Mode, and I don't like the Battle Mode in there.

167
00:10:56,429 --> 00:11:04,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, um, I'm going to our chat room, which of course is always one of our other guests, www.orangelandtrader.com Oh, I'm sorry, and I play Chrome Helms in multiplayer.

168
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,051
[SPEAKER_05]: And got your ass kicked from what I hear.

169
00:11:06,631 --> 00:11:08,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's because my mech sucks.

170
00:11:09,231 --> 00:11:12,752
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking at our chat room, in fact, so many people in chat tonight, the names are scrolling off the screen.

171
00:11:13,152 --> 00:11:14,152
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't see, so...

172
00:11:15,518 --> 00:11:19,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, I want to point out Robert M in chat says, I'd like to see Gyruss on live.

173
00:11:20,362 --> 00:11:20,783
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming.

174
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:21,744
[SPEAKER_05]: We know it's coming.

175
00:11:22,024 --> 00:11:23,085
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been previously announced.

176
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:23,486
[SPEAKER_05]: When?

177
00:11:23,826 --> 00:11:25,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Couldn't tell you, but that's one I'm looking forward to as well.

178
00:11:25,788 --> 00:11:26,308
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Gyruss.

179
00:11:26,749 --> 00:11:27,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome game.

180
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:28,731
[SPEAKER_05]: My Gaming Week.

181
00:11:29,676 --> 00:11:30,417
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

182
00:11:50,095 --> 00:11:51,076
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like Stage 2.

183
00:11:51,236 --> 00:11:55,017
[SPEAKER_05]: The stupid, I don't know what the fuck it is, little asteroid things are pissing me off.

184
00:11:55,057 --> 00:11:56,217
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't shoot fast enough in that game.

185
00:12:14,274 --> 00:12:16,535
[SPEAKER_05]: It will not let me shoot as fast as I want to.

186
00:12:16,615 --> 00:12:17,196
[SPEAKER_05]: You know the trick?

187
00:12:17,216 --> 00:12:17,756
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what I do.

188
00:12:17,796 --> 00:12:25,119
[SPEAKER_05]: I put the controller down, and I tap the buttons like my fingers are running between bullet, bomb, bullet, bomb, bullet, bomb.

189
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:29,001
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do that really fast, and that's how I get all the way through stage four, at least.

190
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:32,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Because stage five, the trick is you have to maneuver around really quickly, and it's kind of hard.

191
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:33,403
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a hard stage.

192
00:12:33,423 --> 00:12:34,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Since that ship is like a boat.

193
00:12:35,984 --> 00:12:38,806
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, we have done...

194
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Scramble, and it's okay.

195
00:12:41,381 --> 00:12:44,985
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if you like the classics, the upgrade was actually one of the nicer upgrades.

196
00:12:45,005 --> 00:12:47,447
[SPEAKER_05]: The graphics do look really well, and the sound's been done a lot better.

197
00:12:48,047 --> 00:12:58,737
[SPEAKER_05]: But the game itself, I can't recommend it when it's put next to $5 games such as Geometry Wars, and hell, even something like Frogger or Time Pilot was a better buy than Scramble, I'm sorry to say.

198
00:12:59,538 --> 00:13:02,421
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish they would put effort into better games, but that's just me.

199
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:04,002
[SPEAKER_05]: The other game I played was...

200
00:13:05,581 --> 00:13:06,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Surprisingly pleasant.

201
00:13:06,902 --> 00:13:10,304
[SPEAKER_05]: I played Test Drive Unlimited, which I actually enjoyed quite a bit.

202
00:13:10,644 --> 00:13:19,349
[SPEAKER_05]: The gameplay is a lot like it reminded me of Need for Speed Underground, and so you're probably thinking to yourself, okay, why do I need yet another racer on the Xbox 360?

203
00:13:19,429 --> 00:13:20,569
[SPEAKER_05]: What makes this so special?

204
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Test Drive Unlimited is massive.

205
00:13:22,431 --> 00:13:32,016
[SPEAKER_05]: You are literally driving around the entire island of Oahu, and it's not 100% geographically correct, but for folks who've never been there like me,

206
00:13:32,797 --> 00:13:38,800
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got that illusion of that it does seem to be pretty right on to what it's probably really like in that environment.

207
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:50,845
[SPEAKER_05]: And you drive around and you do different races, like you stop at different intersections and do races, or you pick up hookers and take them to the shopping place they need to go, or you drive cars, hitchhikers, lots of different types of quests and things you can do.

208
00:13:50,885 --> 00:13:52,726
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a questing driving game.

209
00:13:53,106 --> 00:14:00,389
[SPEAKER_05]: But the other weird thing about it that's getting this game a lot of notoriety is that even when you're playing in single player mode, if you're playing on Xbox Live...

210
00:14:01,304 --> 00:14:05,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the dummy cars that you usually see driving in traffic are actually other players.

211
00:14:06,229 --> 00:14:07,830
[SPEAKER_05]: And you'll see their Xbox Live name.

212
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,552
[SPEAKER_05]: They are playing single mode as well.

213
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,975
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of like an MMO, but not really.

214
00:14:13,475 --> 00:14:14,977
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the weirdest concept.

215
00:14:14,997 --> 00:14:18,160
[SPEAKER_05]: That is exactly why I can't get that game, because I'd be such a jackass.

216
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,121
[SPEAKER_05]: It's weird, though.

217
00:14:20,642 --> 00:14:21,463
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you what, though.

218
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:30,105
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the idea, and I think it's great that they're doing this to make the game different than other racing games.

219
00:14:30,465 --> 00:14:31,785
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know.

220
00:14:32,025 --> 00:14:36,286
[SPEAKER_05]: I find when I'm racing around, I don't really run into other people right next to them very often.

221
00:14:36,326 --> 00:14:38,126
[SPEAKER_05]: I've driven by maybe three people.

222
00:14:39,286 --> 00:14:45,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Supposedly, you're supposed to crash into them and start a race, but sometimes they drive by so fast, you don't even realize somebody went by.

223
00:14:46,268 --> 00:14:47,148
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's what you have to do.

224
00:14:48,682 --> 00:14:49,382
[SPEAKER_05]: It's interesting.

225
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:50,123
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an interesting concept.

226
00:14:50,143 --> 00:14:54,446
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have to play the game a little more to see how it's fully enabled.

227
00:14:54,706 --> 00:14:57,288
[SPEAKER_05]: I just joined the Oil Army Clan thanks to Robway.

228
00:14:57,328 --> 00:14:59,590
[SPEAKER_05]: He created the Oil Army Clan on the game, so I just joined that.

229
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,812
[SPEAKER_05]: So look for that if you're on test drive.

230
00:15:03,991 --> 00:15:04,451
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

231
00:15:22,214 --> 00:15:37,987
[SPEAKER_05]: The other quick thing I wanted to say about Test Drive Unlimited is I was kind of bummed out that some of the multiplayer races, at least none of the ones I drove by, were restricted by car class because I got the game about a week after it came out and by the time I'm ready to do multiplayer races, everybody in there has like a souped up maximum top of the line car.

232
00:15:38,267 --> 00:15:49,416
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would have liked to have seen some multiplayer races that were restricted a little more by the class car so you could have like beginner multiplayer races, intermediate, and not everybody's just kicking my ass because they have a top of the line car because they've been playing longer.

233
00:15:49,777 --> 00:15:50,737
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was my thought.

234
00:15:51,398 --> 00:15:51,478
[SPEAKER_05]: So

235
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:55,960
[SPEAKER_05]: I do recommend Test Drive Unlimited if you're a fan of driving games.

236
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:01,661
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think even if you're not a fan of driving games, rent it, check it out, because you might... I mean, it's a good deal, $40.

237
00:16:02,781 --> 00:16:09,262
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cheaper than the usual Xbox 360 games, so it's hard for me to ignore that as well, being a big factor in why I would recommend this game for you to pick up.

238
00:16:09,442 --> 00:16:11,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, it's fun driving a Lamborghini off-road.

239
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:13,223
[SPEAKER_05]: It is, but... Over hills.

240
00:16:13,303 --> 00:16:14,423
[SPEAKER_05]: The cops get annoying.

241
00:16:14,703 --> 00:16:15,443
[SPEAKER_05]: They get really annoying.

242
00:16:15,723 --> 00:16:16,824
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish there was a way you could turn them off.

243
00:16:16,904 --> 00:16:19,144
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's funny, but the cops, they can't follow you off-road.

244
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:20,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, really?

245
00:16:20,295 --> 00:16:20,895
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't realize that.

246
00:16:20,915 --> 00:16:21,676
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they're stupid.

247
00:16:21,716 --> 00:16:25,497
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't figure out how to get off the road, so they have to just drive through an unpaved section.

248
00:16:25,537 --> 00:16:27,297
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, duh, where'd he go?

249
00:16:27,377 --> 00:16:30,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Or just sit in the grass, and they're like, oh, I don't know how to get to him.

250
00:16:30,798 --> 00:16:36,140
[SPEAKER_05]: JeremyTaw1 in chat says, a friend I know that lives in Hawaii says the map is really close to the area, but it isn't perfect.

251
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,201
[SPEAKER_05]: He says he can see where he is in the game because he knows the roads in person.

252
00:16:39,261 --> 00:16:41,081
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, it's pretty close to the actual thing.

253
00:16:41,742 --> 00:16:42,422
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of interesting.

254
00:16:43,782 --> 00:16:44,042
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

255
00:16:44,843 --> 00:16:46,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Drew Nami, how was your gaming week?

256
00:16:46,932 --> 00:16:49,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not too eventful.

257
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,534
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been leveling a warrior in World of Warcraft.

258
00:16:52,394 --> 00:16:52,854
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty good.

259
00:16:52,874 --> 00:17:01,077
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see where a lot of people say they're IMBA, but I haven't really got past 18, so that remains to be seen.

260
00:17:01,237 --> 00:17:06,079
[SPEAKER_03]: I've also been trying to finish Zenisaga Episode 1, or rather watching it.

261
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:14,942
[SPEAKER_03]: I admit, I like it even though it's very, very long on cutscenes, and the battle system is sort of frustrating.

262
00:17:15,638 --> 00:17:17,600
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a good game, very deep story.

263
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than that, I haven't really been doing much in the way of gaming.

264
00:17:22,463 --> 00:17:22,743
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

265
00:17:23,344 --> 00:17:25,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris, anything you want to share with how your gaming week's been going?

266
00:17:26,026 --> 00:17:27,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you remembered me this time.

267
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:28,187
[SPEAKER_05]: I did, I'm sorry.

268
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:29,408
[SPEAKER_05]: How could I forget?

269
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:30,269
[SPEAKER_05]: You brought me cake.

270
00:17:30,389 --> 00:17:31,450
[SPEAKER_09]: I brought you chocolate.

271
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,751
[SPEAKER_09]: You're a skanky, skanky ho-bag.

272
00:17:32,891 --> 00:17:33,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know.

273
00:17:34,032 --> 00:17:35,032
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, she said Rob is.

274
00:17:35,733 --> 00:17:37,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, why am I a skanky ho-bag?

275
00:17:38,195 --> 00:17:40,176
[SPEAKER_06]: That's her way of saying she loves you.

276
00:17:40,356 --> 00:17:42,638
[SPEAKER_06]: That's her way of saying she loves you.

277
00:17:42,658 --> 00:17:43,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

278
00:17:43,138 --> 00:17:45,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Hugs and kisses and smoothies to you, sweetie.

279
00:17:47,647 --> 00:17:51,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Aside from Sins 2, I got Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance and Baldur's Gate 2 Dark Alliance.

280
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:56,293
[SPEAKER_07]: I found them on Amazon for each $60, but I got them new.

281
00:17:57,013 --> 00:17:58,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Did it have a monkey on the cover?

282
00:17:58,354 --> 00:17:59,114
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it didn't have a monkey.

283
00:17:59,154 --> 00:17:59,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up.

284
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:03,917
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been playing both of those because I never got to finish both of them.

285
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:06,999
[SPEAKER_07]: I like it.

286
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,900
[SPEAKER_07]: That was my gaming week.

287
00:18:10,221 --> 00:18:11,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, right on.

288
00:18:11,522 --> 00:18:14,524
[SPEAKER_07]: And I burned my fingernail lighting your candles.

289
00:18:19,912 --> 00:18:21,814
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

290
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,449
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

291
00:19:05,407 --> 00:19:06,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

292
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:24,300
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

293
00:19:50,865 --> 00:19:54,149
[SPEAKER_05]: About the 200th regular week we've been putting out some type of gaming-related programming out there.

294
00:19:54,169 --> 00:19:57,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Not to mention all the live shows that we've done, special shows and fuck-off shows.

295
00:19:57,734 --> 00:19:58,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

296
00:19:58,174 --> 00:19:58,835
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been live at E3.

297
00:19:58,855 --> 00:20:00,698
[SPEAKER_05]: We were live at Arena this year for E3.

298
00:20:01,018 --> 00:20:03,321
[SPEAKER_05]: We were live at the B3 DDR tournament.

299
00:20:03,341 --> 00:20:05,123
[SPEAKER_05]: We were live at a Scandia tournament.

300
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:06,145
[SPEAKER_05]: We were live at some...

301
00:20:06,685 --> 00:20:08,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Weren't we live at Milpitas once?

302
00:20:08,246 --> 00:20:09,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Golf Land for DDR?

303
00:20:09,726 --> 00:20:10,286
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we were.

304
00:20:10,546 --> 00:20:14,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a bunch of crazy shit we've been doing throughout the years with DDR community.

305
00:20:14,227 --> 00:20:15,488
[SPEAKER_05]: And now general gaming as well.

306
00:20:15,508 --> 00:20:19,109
[SPEAKER_05]: We know our fan base has now expanded past just those who are into music games.

307
00:20:19,369 --> 00:20:21,930
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, we'll never forget our love of music games.

308
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:22,830
[SPEAKER_05]: We always have plenty of news.

309
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, we have the DDR sneak peeks tonight.

310
00:20:24,531 --> 00:20:25,991
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that just further goes to show that.

311
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,672
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't forgotten our roots.

312
00:20:27,712 --> 00:20:30,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Konami finally noticed us like two months ago.

313
00:20:30,073 --> 00:20:30,993
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of amazing.

314
00:20:31,593 --> 00:20:32,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

315
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:58,266
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

316
00:21:08,437 --> 00:21:09,858
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network

317
00:21:30,226 --> 00:21:34,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, we're not afraid to run the rumors when we sense there's some bit of legitimacy to them.

318
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:38,071
[SPEAKER_05]: And we want to, you know, scoop the big, big media reports and things of that nature.

319
00:21:38,111 --> 00:21:42,094
[SPEAKER_05]: But unfortunately, once in a while, something's going to happen that causes us to be wrong.

320
00:21:42,114 --> 00:21:44,215
[SPEAKER_05]: And unfortunately, this time it happens to be a big one.

321
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:47,258
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was a story that was picked up on a lot of news sites that we ran.

322
00:21:47,318 --> 00:21:48,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what happened?

323
00:21:48,138 --> 00:21:49,398
[SPEAKER_05]: And this isn't really our fault.

324
00:21:49,658 --> 00:21:50,259
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's not.

325
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:52,879
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the company, the site.

326
00:21:53,139 --> 00:21:55,920
[SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have to understand, this is what's going to happen when we do this.

327
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,841
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, is Ain't It Cool News right all the time?

328
00:21:58,121 --> 00:21:58,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell no, they're not.

329
00:21:58,961 --> 00:22:01,682
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, they... And stuff changes all the time.

330
00:22:01,762 --> 00:22:03,782
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's just like when we report dates and stuff.

331
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:04,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Dates change all the time.

332
00:22:04,983 --> 00:22:09,404
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways, this is about the Phantasy Star Universe online subscription fees.

333
00:22:10,104 --> 00:22:15,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, before we reported that the Xbox 360 version would be free and the PlayStation 2 and PC would be pay.

334
00:22:16,466 --> 00:22:22,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Sega went back on what they decided to do and they're deciding to charge for the online service.

335
00:22:22,887 --> 00:22:24,608
[SPEAKER_04]: And here is exactly why they're doing it.

336
00:22:25,148 --> 00:22:28,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and this is straight from an email from our sales rep from Sega.

337
00:22:29,069 --> 00:22:29,789
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, um,

338
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:35,904
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to update you on what's going on regarding the subscription service we have with Phantasy Star Universe.

339
00:22:36,024 --> 00:22:45,572
[SPEAKER_04]: As you know, the game will have an extensive 40-hour single-player mode as well as online questing mode that allows players to create a character, customize that character, and meet up with other players to complete quests online.

340
00:22:45,892 --> 00:22:52,557
[SPEAKER_04]: The single-player portion is separate from the online mode, and it will work as normal on PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, and PC.

341
00:22:53,658 --> 00:22:55,580
[SPEAKER_04]: The online mode, however, is a bit different.

342
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,262
[SPEAKER_04]: To play online, the user will have to create an account with Sega and pay a monthly fee of $9.99.

343
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:04,033
[SPEAKER_04]: This will be required for all versions of the game, including the 360 version.

344
00:23:04,093 --> 00:23:08,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Previously, we had thought the 360 version would not have a fee due to the Xbox Live fees.

345
00:23:08,736 --> 00:23:09,877
[SPEAKER_04]: That has since changed.

346
00:23:10,157 --> 00:23:20,745
[SPEAKER_04]: The good news is, this is nothing new for Phantasy Star Universe, in that all online versions of Phantasy Star have had this fee in the past, and that even the last Xbox version, which played over Live,

347
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,941
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

348
00:23:46,328 --> 00:23:54,010
[SPEAKER_04]: However, the good news is that we have a marketplace demo that will allow users to get a small taste of the offline and online portions of the game.

349
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:59,492
[SPEAKER_04]: And it says, I know subscription fees are not a very common thing for the console games, and that's why I wanted to inform you of this.

350
00:24:01,012 --> 00:24:08,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, unfortunate, but I mean, Sega told us one thing and then told us another, but as you can understand, I mean, you know they were considering it.

351
00:24:09,055 --> 00:24:15,457
[SPEAKER_04]: They were considering it, and I think what it comes down to is that they found out they can charge for it, and so they went ahead and did it.

352
00:24:15,577 --> 00:24:15,957
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, and

353
00:24:16,676 --> 00:24:18,016
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of negative feedback from chat.

354
00:24:18,076 --> 00:24:21,757
[SPEAKER_04]: People saying they're not going to get the game now because they don't pay for MMOs on monthly.

355
00:24:21,837 --> 00:24:22,937
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm with them on that.

356
00:24:23,057 --> 00:24:26,878
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to buy the game, and to be honest, I'm not really interested anymore.

357
00:24:27,538 --> 00:24:28,959
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm interested in the Marketplace demo.

358
00:24:28,979 --> 00:24:31,119
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to make my decision solely based off the demo.

359
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:37,620
[SPEAKER_05]: I am encouraged that at least the demo they're going to put on Marketplace will support on and offline, and that will be the decision maker for me.

360
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:38,961
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll pay for MMOs.

361
00:24:38,981 --> 00:24:39,841
[SPEAKER_05]: I paid for World of Warcraft.

362
00:24:39,861 --> 00:24:40,661
[SPEAKER_05]: I paid for Final Fantasy XI.

363
00:24:41,441 --> 00:24:46,223
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not against paying for MMOs, but it's got to be good, and I want to try it before I buy it.

364
00:24:46,243 --> 00:24:46,803
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Guild Wars.

365
00:25:05,992 --> 00:25:07,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they don't have Guild Wars on the 360.

366
00:25:08,274 --> 00:25:17,880
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I don't play MMOs on the 360, because I don't have the time to dedicate, you know, to play it regularly, so I don't want to pay this extra monthly fee, because I know I'm not going to use it.

367
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:21,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas, you know, Phantasy Star, I figured, okay, I get to buy it, and I can play online whenever I want.

368
00:25:22,183 --> 00:25:24,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome, you know, that sold it for me.

369
00:25:24,144 --> 00:25:28,307
[SPEAKER_04]: But now this news, you know, right when I saw it, I was like, fuck, you know.

370
00:25:28,407 --> 00:25:35,452
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew this was something that was going to possibly happen, so not a huge surprise, since they've been charging all,

371
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:37,987
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, all the time, but whatever.

372
00:25:38,047 --> 00:25:39,508
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, life goes on, I guess.

373
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:40,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, kind of unfortunate.

374
00:25:40,849 --> 00:25:48,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, I'm really curious about your thoughts, because you're a big Phantasy Star supporter, and I imagine you're probably going to play this anyway, but what do you think about all this back and forth, paying, no paying stuff?

375
00:25:49,774 --> 00:25:55,578
[SPEAKER_09]: I think half of it is that they're charging because, well, first of all, they're in the business to make money, so why shouldn't they charge?

376
00:25:56,518 --> 00:26:01,301
[SPEAKER_09]: But regardless, and actually Ranma made this point in the chat room, it's still one of the cheapest MMOs you can play.

377
00:26:01,481 --> 00:26:02,462
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that, you know...

378
00:26:04,282 --> 00:26:13,865
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that if charging the fee might lead to better service, you know, give them more money for development into the game to expand it later on, that's my hope.

379
00:26:15,065 --> 00:26:18,306
[SPEAKER_09]: But I really don't care because I was going to play it anyway.

380
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:19,747
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

381
00:26:20,427 --> 00:26:24,368
[SPEAKER_09]: I figured if you want to play something bad enough, no price should keep you from enjoying it.

382
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:25,468
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

383
00:26:25,488 --> 00:26:26,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we'll see.

384
00:26:26,609 --> 00:26:29,269
[SPEAKER_05]: We encourage your emails if you want to give us some feedback on this.

385
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:31,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

386
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:36,571
[SPEAKER_05]: And I imagine some people might be kind of pissed at us for reporting the news before, but you know what, guys?

387
00:26:36,591 --> 00:26:40,233
[SPEAKER_05]: We had certainly a big reason to believe it was true, because Sega told us.

388
00:26:40,654 --> 00:26:45,196
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, if you are unhappy with that, sorry.

389
00:26:45,819 --> 00:26:52,281
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess you can stick to getting press releases and things when everybody else gets them and won't know any news beforehand.

390
00:26:52,621 --> 00:27:09,187
[SPEAKER_05]: But to Loki's credit, a lot of the rest of that story has turned out to be right on when it comes to a lot of the stories about the Wii that we're going to get into tonight and the GT steering wheel and some of the other things that you report in that story are coming true.

391
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:10,787
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't predict the future.

392
00:27:11,388 --> 00:27:15,489
[SPEAKER_04]: If they go and change what their plan is for something, we're not

393
00:27:16,055 --> 00:27:16,877
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to know.

394
00:27:16,957 --> 00:27:18,600
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's up to them.

395
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:26,937
[SPEAKER_04]: So if they decide to go back on what they want charged, hell, we can't be right all the time when it comes to them changing stuff.

396
00:27:26,957 --> 00:27:27,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, right.

397
00:27:28,652 --> 00:27:31,454
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, as we mentioned, there was a lot of big news this week.

398
00:27:31,514 --> 00:27:35,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Big, big, big news about this little system coming out from Nintendo called Wii.

399
00:27:36,397 --> 00:27:42,601
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're dedicating just about the rest of this segment to talk about this because there was so much news that came with the Wii.

400
00:27:42,981 --> 00:27:50,026
[SPEAKER_05]: So, of course, if you've been living in a cave or for some reason you only get your gaming news from OLR, which is kind of cool, I guess, here's the deal.

401
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:54,088
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wii is coming out on November 19th, and it's coming out for a price of $250.00.

402
00:27:56,629 --> 00:27:57,870
[SPEAKER_05]: 249.99.

403
00:27:56,669 --> 00:27:57,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

404
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:59,791
[SPEAKER_05]: After tax, it's going to be over $250.

405
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:02,152
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be packaged with Wii Sports.

406
00:28:02,832 --> 00:28:04,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Controllers will be sold separately.

407
00:28:04,953 --> 00:28:09,594
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wiimote, which is the official name for it, it sounds like, the Wiimote is going to be what?

408
00:28:10,535 --> 00:28:11,375
[SPEAKER_05]: The remote and nunchuck.

409
00:28:11,395 --> 00:28:16,117
[SPEAKER_05]: One price, and then the nunchuck, the Wiimote's going to be like $40, and the nunchuck's going to be $20.

410
00:28:16,317 --> 00:28:18,758
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was everything that was announced at the press conference.

411
00:28:18,818 --> 00:28:22,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much the price point it looks like right now is the remote's going to be $39.99.

412
00:28:24,778 --> 00:28:28,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas the attachments are going to be $19.99.

413
00:28:28,426 --> 00:28:31,833
[SPEAKER_04]: And who called the price?

414
00:28:31,893 --> 00:28:32,414
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be me.

415
00:28:33,216 --> 00:28:33,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job.

416
00:28:34,638 --> 00:28:35,899
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, so that's where it stands.

417
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, a lot of people are saying the controllers are too damn expensive.

418
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:38,820
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

419
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:43,002
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I didn't, I mean, okay, because when you consider it's the nunchuck and the controller, it's going to be about $60.

420
00:28:43,342 --> 00:28:44,923
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to buy the nunchuck.

421
00:28:44,943 --> 00:28:46,244
[SPEAKER_04]: You do not have to have it.

422
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:49,145
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of games do not use it unless it's like a first-person shooter.

423
00:28:49,285 --> 00:28:52,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, I do believe, isn't a wireless Xbox 360 controller $49?

424
00:28:53,867 --> 00:29:01,651
[SPEAKER_04]: It's $49.99, and that's not even with the rechargeable, I mean, granted, the Wii does not have a rechargeable battery pack, at least as far as I'm aware.

425
00:29:02,391 --> 00:29:03,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Two double A's, but it does last

426
00:29:04,195 --> 00:29:05,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Quite a long time, apparently.

427
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,136
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, I don't know.

428
00:29:08,316 --> 00:29:10,436
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not trying to knock Xbox 360's price at all.

429
00:29:10,496 --> 00:29:11,016
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's fair.

430
00:29:11,076 --> 00:29:15,257
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying, you know, Nintendo doesn't seem that bad, but a lot of people were very disappointed in the price that they heard.

431
00:29:15,597 --> 00:29:18,978
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought it was kind of like, well, isn't that what kind of everyone was expecting?

432
00:29:19,378 --> 00:29:20,699
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess some people had their sights on $200.

433
00:29:21,439 --> 00:29:21,959
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know.

434
00:29:22,439 --> 00:29:26,740
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say, I swear to God, I said on this show previously, I bet you anything Wii Sports is a pack-in game.

435
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:30,121
[SPEAKER_05]: And people were telling me, no, because they haven't done a pack-in game in years.

436
00:29:30,141 --> 00:29:31,121
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it makes perfect sense.

437
00:29:31,161 --> 00:29:32,281
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Wii Sports is like,

438
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:36,553
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not gamey enough to be a game, but it's good enough to be a packing game.

439
00:29:36,573 --> 00:29:37,733
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like world-class track meet.

440
00:29:37,933 --> 00:29:39,014
[SPEAKER_05]: That's exactly what it is to me.

441
00:29:39,054 --> 00:29:40,015
[SPEAKER_05]: It's world-class track meet.

442
00:29:40,355 --> 00:29:42,056
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also something that's very simple.

443
00:29:42,076 --> 00:29:44,918
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll teach you how to use the controller and stuff like that.

444
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:45,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

445
00:29:45,999 --> 00:29:48,581
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, we have plenty of Wii news all around the table tonight.

446
00:29:49,001 --> 00:29:50,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there is a bit more about Wii Sports.

447
00:29:52,103 --> 00:30:00,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, it is going to be bundled in with the Wii at release, but there's been suggestions, especially, actually, it states that...

448
00:30:01,288 --> 00:30:04,689
[SPEAKER_09]: for EGM that it was going to support over 30 different games.

449
00:30:05,509 --> 00:30:09,510
[SPEAKER_09]: But the official ones listed are tennis, baseball, golf, bowling, and boxing.

450
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:14,611
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's all pretty much the same simple thing.

451
00:30:14,651 --> 00:30:21,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Like for anyone who watched the press release, it's pretty much the same type style of thing that you saw in the press release.

452
00:30:22,513 --> 00:30:22,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

453
00:30:23,415 --> 00:30:24,676
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess bowling is a sport.

454
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:26,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Bowling will be kind of fun.

455
00:30:26,678 --> 00:30:28,299
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if it will have curling.

456
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:32,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Tennis wasn't bad, but again, I bet baseball will be a lot of fun with multiple people.

457
00:30:32,483 --> 00:30:46,694
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, I think the concept and the reason why the remote costs so much and watching the Wii press event and everything, I think the concept is you're going to build your personality on your Wii remote thing and you want to take it to other places, right?

458
00:30:48,024 --> 00:30:59,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, actually, it's stating that in particular for Wii Sports is that you're going to use your, I guess, the Mii caricature to play in the game so that you can actually play versus people to personalize the game for you.

459
00:31:00,916 --> 00:31:05,019
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't think that it's Nintendo wants you to buy four Wiimotes for your household.

460
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:11,583
[SPEAKER_05]: They want you and all three of your friends to buy Wiis, and then you bring your Wiimote with you, like you bring your iPod with you everywhere to share music.

461
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:15,566
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to bring your Wiimote, and I guess I'm also being corrected in chat, that's not the real name.

462
00:31:15,606 --> 00:31:17,807
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be the Wii Remote, but I don't care.

463
00:31:17,827 --> 00:31:18,908
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a Wii Remote, or Wiimote.

464
00:31:19,329 --> 00:31:20,269
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like WiiCon.

465
00:31:20,609 --> 00:31:23,110
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they've used Wiimote actually.

466
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:26,130
[SPEAKER_05]: I swear I heard in that press conference somebody say Wiimote, but whatever, it doesn't matter.

467
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:32,652
[SPEAKER_05]: So whatever that thing is, the thing, you're going to take the thing with you to other people's houses and then, you know, your character's on there ready to go.

468
00:31:33,132 --> 00:31:40,494
[SPEAKER_05]: And it has, didn't we already reveal on this show previously in some news article that it had some type of storage on the actual remote itself?

469
00:31:40,734 --> 00:31:42,854
[SPEAKER_05]: So it probably saves basic stats and things.

470
00:31:42,914 --> 00:31:46,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, you can go to your friend's house and, oh, hey, you're four and two in baseball right now.

471
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:47,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's play, you know.

472
00:31:47,882 --> 00:31:49,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Sort of be like bringing your memory card with you.

473
00:31:49,923 --> 00:31:50,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Or your DS.

474
00:31:51,244 --> 00:31:52,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

475
00:31:52,604 --> 00:31:54,345
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's exactly what it is.

476
00:31:54,425 --> 00:31:54,986
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know.

477
00:31:56,526 --> 00:31:56,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

478
00:31:57,607 --> 00:31:59,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, some other interesting things about the Wii.

479
00:31:59,268 --> 00:32:06,111
[SPEAKER_04]: In Japan, of course, which was the first news that we got about the Wii, it's going to be launching for 25,000 yen.

480
00:32:06,811 --> 00:32:12,414
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's kind of interesting, though, is they are not getting the pack-in for Wii Sports.

481
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:13,535
[SPEAKER_04]: That is separate.

482
00:32:13,635 --> 00:32:14,855
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to buy that separately.

483
00:32:14,935 --> 00:32:16,076
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's actually going to cost...

484
00:32:17,116 --> 00:32:33,164
[SPEAKER_04]: around 3,800 yen is going to be the price of the remote, 1,800 for the nunchuck attachment, and 1,800 for the classic controller, which also, by the way, 1,999 for the classic controller in the United States.

485
00:32:35,045 --> 00:32:37,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Wii Sports, though, is going to be a pretty inexpensive game.

486
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,971
[SPEAKER_04]: So that should be pretty interesting.

487
00:32:40,991 --> 00:32:49,055
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the other games I saw on there, which is really cool, Wii Play, which is going to be for the people that saw the E3 tech demos and stuff, like the shooting demo.

488
00:32:49,095 --> 00:32:49,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Duck Hunt?

489
00:32:50,336 --> 00:32:51,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like the Duck Hunt game.

490
00:32:51,857 --> 00:32:54,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are in Wii Play, some of them.

491
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:55,279
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of cool.

492
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:56,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully we'll get it in the States.

493
00:32:56,659 --> 00:33:00,701
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that UK's getting it and stuff like that, but it should be interesting.

494
00:33:00,801 --> 00:33:04,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Camden in our chat room is making a little play on the whole Mii thing and put Mii Emoto.

495
00:33:05,324 --> 00:33:05,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Get it?

496
00:33:05,664 --> 00:33:05,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

497
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:15,231
[SPEAKER_05]: You remember when you saw the E3 demo with all four of them playing and the little heads were on the bodies and they looked like Miyamoto and everything?

498
00:33:15,671 --> 00:33:17,892
[SPEAKER_05]: That was it, because they had made their things on the Mi.

499
00:33:18,432 --> 00:33:19,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it all makes sense.

500
00:33:19,592 --> 00:33:20,593
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of interesting.

501
00:33:20,993 --> 00:33:24,854
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to say real quick, or ask a quick question.

502
00:33:25,214 --> 00:33:27,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do you think Japan's not getting Wii Sports?

503
00:33:27,174 --> 00:33:30,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do you think they opted not to do that and do a cheaper bundle instead without it?

504
00:33:31,992 --> 00:33:36,995
[SPEAKER_09]: Just economical reasons, I actually stand a chance of making more money having the game separate.

505
00:33:37,275 --> 00:33:44,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Japan's getting theirs on December 2nd, which is surprising because they're not the first ones to launch with the Wii, the United States is.

506
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:44,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

507
00:33:45,541 --> 00:33:46,001
[SPEAKER_04]: We're loved.

508
00:33:46,961 --> 00:33:47,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Heart, Nintendo.

509
00:33:48,763 --> 00:33:54,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, as far as speaking of the Nintendo love, this is in UK news.

510
00:33:55,355 --> 00:34:02,599
[SPEAKER_09]: The Wii is going to retail for 249 euros, which is 179 pounds in the UK.

511
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:06,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Also with it will be about 20 release games.

512
00:34:07,201 --> 00:34:21,908
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Wii Play, Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess, and some third-party games like Red Steel, Need for Speed Carbon, Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam, Pixar's Cars.

513
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:24,760
[SPEAKER_09]: and Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz.

514
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,761
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds kind of fun.

515
00:34:27,101 --> 00:34:29,722
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, it will be bundled with Wii Sports as well.

516
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:37,146
[SPEAKER_09]: It will come with one Wii Remote, one Nunchuck and, again, Wii Sports.

517
00:34:39,047 --> 00:34:45,930
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's funny that they're getting the... I think it's interesting that Europe is not getting the shaft for once with the release time.

518
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,912
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, sure, we're beating them to it, but to be ahead of Japan...

519
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:52,666
[SPEAKER_05]: That's weird to me that Japan isn't getting this thing until December.

520
00:34:53,046 --> 00:34:53,946
[SPEAKER_05]: That is so weird to me.

521
00:34:54,687 --> 00:34:58,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, actually, it says that the European release date is 8th of December.

522
00:34:59,248 --> 00:34:59,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my bad.

523
00:34:59,868 --> 00:35:00,488
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was before.

524
00:35:00,508 --> 00:35:00,808
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

525
00:35:00,828 --> 00:35:01,929
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say.

526
00:35:01,989 --> 00:35:02,829
[SPEAKER_05]: My bad, my bad.

527
00:35:02,869 --> 00:35:04,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so Europe did get the shaft.

528
00:35:04,089 --> 00:35:05,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, guys.

529
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:06,710
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that bad.

530
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,851
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not as bad as the usual Nintendo shaft.

531
00:35:08,871 --> 00:35:09,571
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not as bad.

532
00:35:09,711 --> 00:35:11,192
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess there's that.

533
00:35:11,212 --> 00:35:12,352
[SPEAKER_04]: And I understand why they're doing it.

534
00:35:12,372 --> 00:35:14,533
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because they're launching so many units in the United States.

535
00:35:14,553 --> 00:35:19,274
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got to catch up, make sure they have enough for the launch in the other territories.

536
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's also going to, of course, we'll be going into a little bit more about this later.

537
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:28,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, we'll have the Wii Channel menu and a pretty interesting interface.

538
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:29,118
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

539
00:35:29,571 --> 00:35:36,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if you want to spin your globe all the way around and take a look at Australia, Australia's launch looks pretty comparable to what Europe's getting.

540
00:35:37,294 --> 00:35:39,235
[SPEAKER_05]: The console's going to launch there on December 7, 2006.

541
00:35:40,415 --> 00:35:45,017
[SPEAKER_05]: The retail price will be $399.95, but that's Australian.

542
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:49,778
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they're also going to have Wii Sports as their pack-in game.

543
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:54,420
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, all the other good stuff you've been hearing about with the interface and everything.

544
00:35:54,744 --> 00:35:55,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing too different there.

545
00:35:56,085 --> 00:35:58,527
[SPEAKER_05]: But Australia's not being left out of the worldwide launch.

546
00:35:58,768 --> 00:36:05,694
[SPEAKER_05]: So it looks like Nintendo has this worldwide launch thing down where Sony, with their whole worldwide means Japan and the U.S.

547
00:36:05,774 --> 00:36:11,499
[SPEAKER_05]: only, might need to... Sony just makes it easy to bash on them.

548
00:36:11,539 --> 00:36:12,600
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't want to.

549
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,721
[SPEAKER_09]: My question for Nintendo is, what about Africa?

550
00:36:16,043 --> 00:36:17,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Where is that only the domain of Sony now?

551
00:36:18,805 --> 00:36:19,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Africa.

552
00:36:19,366 --> 00:36:19,806
[SPEAKER_09]: Africa.

553
00:36:20,767 --> 00:36:20,927
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

554
00:36:21,496 --> 00:36:23,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe we'll hear something on that later, I don't know.

555
00:36:23,538 --> 00:36:31,284
[SPEAKER_09]: But we all know that Mr. Kudaragi needs crayons and wears a helmet, so we can't be too upset at him.

556
00:36:32,005 --> 00:36:33,766
[SPEAKER_05]: I will be curious to see.

557
00:36:33,827 --> 00:36:42,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I think like most PlayStation consoles, and I don't want to get off topic too much, but like most PlayStation consoles, I don't think we'll truly be able to judge the PlayStation 3 until this time next year.

558
00:36:43,415 --> 00:36:46,898
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't think we're going to start seeing the big guns until then, but whatever.

559
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:47,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

560
00:36:47,577 --> 00:36:49,538
[SPEAKER_05]: I did say November I gave you a couple weeks in November

561
00:37:18,988 --> 00:37:20,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Meg Z got an exact date.

562
00:37:20,251 --> 00:37:21,213
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I should point that out.

563
00:37:21,373 --> 00:37:22,817
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw her call that on her live journal.

564
00:37:22,857 --> 00:37:23,458
[SPEAKER_05]: That was cool.

565
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,142
[SPEAKER_07]: She was really, really happy about that.

566
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:33,773
[SPEAKER_05]: I do want to point out, Loki, in your thing you did on 198, you were one of the first people to say, hey, Nintendo is debating launching after Sony.

567
00:37:33,973 --> 00:37:38,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Because most people, when they were guessing the launch date, were guessing things before the 17th.

568
00:37:38,355 --> 00:37:41,416
[SPEAKER_05]: You were one of the first people to say, they are thinking about doing it after.

569
00:37:41,516 --> 00:37:46,217
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest, all the dates in our system that we had, all the launch games were on the 15th of November.

570
00:37:46,357 --> 00:37:52,139
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, that's got to be a to-be-announced date, because there's no way that they would launch it at the same time as Sony.

571
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:53,279
[SPEAKER_04]: And here I was wrong, though.

572
00:37:54,127 --> 00:37:55,828
[SPEAKER_04]: It was right in front of my face.

573
00:37:56,348 --> 00:37:57,469
[SPEAKER_04]: But whatever.

574
00:37:57,589 --> 00:37:58,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares?

575
00:37:58,389 --> 00:38:01,771
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a fun little game until the system actually launches.

576
00:38:02,231 --> 00:38:05,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranma in our chat regarding the Wii launch in Africa says, Fuck them.

577
00:38:05,472 --> 00:38:07,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Send Africa refurbished N64s.

578
00:38:07,893 --> 00:38:10,054
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not nice.

579
00:38:11,395 --> 00:38:12,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Have Ellen give out some Wiis.

580
00:38:13,175 --> 00:38:14,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Have Ellen give out some Wiis to Africa.

581
00:38:14,816 --> 00:38:15,316
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate Ellen.

582
00:38:15,356 --> 00:38:16,797
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll send Suzanne Summers there.

583
00:38:17,177 --> 00:38:19,519
[SPEAKER_09]: with food for the starving children and wheeze.

584
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:22,501
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys, he gave away to a blind guy.

585
00:38:22,541 --> 00:38:23,661
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell is he going to do with that?

586
00:38:23,681 --> 00:38:29,825
[SPEAKER_05]: There's lots of areas to Africa and I'm sure some of them are waiting and willing for their wheeze.

587
00:38:29,866 --> 00:38:30,426
[SPEAKER_05]: They want it.

588
00:38:30,566 --> 00:38:32,127
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually did go searching for the date.

589
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:39,952
[SPEAKER_09]: I could not find it, but I would imagine given that the majority of the world is getting theirs in December, theirs is probably close to the same time.

590
00:38:40,432 --> 00:38:41,613
[SPEAKER_05]: If not, then early next year.

591
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:44,855
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure you will have your wheeze soon enough, Africa.

592
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:45,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, it's

593
00:38:46,395 --> 00:38:53,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, as we mentioned before, I believe we talked about this, it came out that the Wii will not support DVD playback.

594
00:38:53,959 --> 00:39:01,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, what we were told, of course, before is that they're going to have an add-on little thing for it, kind of like the Xbox did where you'd be able to play DVDs.

595
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:04,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they've opted on not doing that at all.

596
00:39:05,085 --> 00:39:12,008
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, it says that Nintendo of America's Vice President of Marketing and Corporate Affairs, Perrin Kaplan, confirmed to IGN,

597
00:39:12,712 --> 00:39:17,296
[SPEAKER_04]: We today that its forthcoming Wii console will not play Hollywood DVD movies.

598
00:39:17,757 --> 00:39:25,304
[SPEAKER_04]: The decision to remove the functionality was made in order to deliver the machine at cheaper costs because most people today already own DVD players.

599
00:39:25,704 --> 00:39:27,165
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be honest, it makes perfect sense.

600
00:39:27,606 --> 00:39:31,469
[SPEAKER_04]: The GameCube didn't play DVDs, and I wasn't sad about it, so who cares?

601
00:39:31,749 --> 00:39:32,910
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's interesting about this?

602
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:36,774
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a direct opposite philosophy to what Sony's doing.

603
00:39:37,307 --> 00:39:37,607
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

604
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:58,112
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

605
00:40:12,126 --> 00:40:15,950
[SPEAKER_05]: There are things that are in the interface that aren't only strictly games, right?

606
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:17,791
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a little something extra.

607
00:40:18,091 --> 00:40:22,415
[SPEAKER_09]: That is true, but I still think that the focus is on games and should stay that way.

608
00:40:22,855 --> 00:40:27,319
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I think that Sony's shooting themselves in the balls.

609
00:40:27,399 --> 00:40:31,823
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's more of a cost of technology thing where it's like, you know, why pay for the DVD player to be in there, you know,

610
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:32,951
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't catch this.

611
00:40:32,971 --> 00:40:35,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Why did Nintendo tell you there was going to be a dongle and now they didn't?

612
00:40:48,889 --> 00:40:51,430
[SPEAKER_04]: That's because of the licensing for DVD playback.

613
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:56,732
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to pay for licensing fees, and that's why they charge for that stuff, because it covers the cost of licensing.

614
00:40:56,752 --> 00:40:58,093
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why Xbox does the same thing.

615
00:40:58,353 --> 00:41:01,715
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not because it can't, it's just because, well, you know, it's just not gonna.

616
00:41:01,915 --> 00:41:02,755
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotcha, I gotcha.

617
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:07,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, as far as... We are just so Wii-centric today, aren't we?

618
00:41:07,806 --> 00:41:10,188
[SPEAKER_09]: It also gave me an excuse to say Wii-centric.

619
00:41:10,288 --> 00:41:12,210
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the hugest thing in gaming right now.

620
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:15,272
[SPEAKER_05]: When we get into Part B, we'll have some non-Wii stuff, but we've got to get this out.

621
00:41:15,592 --> 00:41:18,335
[SPEAKER_09]: I just said that so that I could use Wii-centric in a sentence.

622
00:41:18,515 --> 00:41:19,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Cute.

623
00:41:20,296 --> 00:41:24,000
[SPEAKER_09]: But regarding more Wii games, actually, they have announced...

624
00:41:25,395 --> 00:41:31,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Resident Evil game for the Wii titled Biohazard Umbrella Chronicles.

625
00:41:32,418 --> 00:41:40,841
[SPEAKER_09]: It's produced by Masachika Kawata who was also the one who ported RE4 to the PlayStation 2.

626
00:41:42,702 --> 00:41:43,703
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to make this crack.

627
00:41:44,183 --> 00:41:44,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Resident Weevil.

628
00:41:46,404 --> 00:41:47,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Resident Weevil.

629
00:41:48,024 --> 00:41:48,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to hell!

630
00:41:50,245 --> 00:41:52,086
[SPEAKER_09]: And take your toilet paper joke book with you.

631
00:41:53,587 --> 00:41:54,547
[SPEAKER_03]: It survived for this long.

632
00:41:55,416 --> 00:42:23,506
[SPEAKER_09]: Resident Weevil God Capcom was saying that they were supposed to combine the gaming experience and atmosphere but involve the Wii control system with it they're still not leaving any details it's still saying it's an action game still is going to use the WiiCon but they're not really giving any more detail however another game that we did get some detail on was Forever Blue which is a diving game

633
00:42:24,266 --> 00:42:26,689
[SPEAKER_09]: that will be coming out for Wii.

634
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:28,891
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds interesting.

635
00:42:29,291 --> 00:42:31,393
[SPEAKER_09]: I love those little quirky games.

636
00:42:32,494 --> 00:42:40,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, you know, Resident Evil 4 was badass on the GameCube and was really like the last kick in the butt that system had, I mean, in the right direction.

637
00:42:40,503 --> 00:42:41,383
[SPEAKER_05]: So what do you think?

638
00:42:41,443 --> 00:42:46,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Is Resident Evil Wii going to be like the holy crap, Nintendo's not just cutesy things type game?

639
00:42:46,609 --> 00:42:47,870
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a feeling it's going to do that.

640
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:50,588
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also another game that was mentioned.

641
00:42:51,109 --> 00:42:54,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Hajime Tano Wii, which means starting out with Wii.

642
00:42:54,472 --> 00:42:56,474
[SPEAKER_09]: It's supposed to be one of the launch titles.

643
00:42:56,995 --> 00:43:00,038
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's supposed to be a bunch of mini-games with the duck hunt.

644
00:43:00,138 --> 00:43:02,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you guys getting used to that name now?

645
00:43:03,181 --> 00:43:03,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Wii?

646
00:43:03,941 --> 00:43:04,802
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's cute.

647
00:43:05,463 --> 00:43:05,763
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

648
00:43:06,124 --> 00:43:06,924
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's the right thing.

649
00:43:06,944 --> 00:43:08,826
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Nintendo's making a lot of smart decisions here.

650
00:43:09,227 --> 00:43:11,489
[SPEAKER_09]: What was it that I said months ago?

651
00:43:12,165 --> 00:43:12,365
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

652
00:43:12,825 --> 00:43:20,530
[SPEAKER_09]: The whole point of advertising, when you come up with a name for something, you need something memorable, something that people are going to talk about.

653
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:22,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Something simple.

654
00:43:23,631 --> 00:43:24,552
[SPEAKER_09]: And it fits all three.

655
00:43:24,732 --> 00:43:27,073
[SPEAKER_05]: And boy, the internet would not shut up about Wii.

656
00:43:27,173 --> 00:43:31,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Check any game blog or major gaming site or little gaming site and it was Wii, Wii, Wii.

657
00:43:31,856 --> 00:43:34,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless, you know, it was an Xbox or Sony site.

658
00:43:34,337 --> 00:43:36,678
[SPEAKER_05]: It was all about the Wii all this week.

659
00:43:36,858 --> 00:43:38,719
[SPEAKER_09]: There is rarely such a thing as bad press.

660
00:43:38,739 --> 00:43:39,900
[SPEAKER_09]: I always say rarely, not ever.

661
00:43:40,325 --> 00:43:40,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Sonya and E3

662
00:43:59,153 --> 00:43:59,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

663
00:44:13,283 --> 00:44:14,504
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure Charum's going to yell it out.

664
00:44:14,864 --> 00:44:17,385
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say December 8th, for some reason it sticks out of my mind.

665
00:44:17,465 --> 00:44:17,905
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why.

666
00:44:18,065 --> 00:44:19,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that's because it was the Europe launch.

667
00:44:19,486 --> 00:44:19,746
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

668
00:44:20,026 --> 00:44:27,850
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, what's interesting is that there's a pretty big difference between the GameCube version and the Wii version of Twilight Princess, and that is how Link is holding his sword.

669
00:44:28,371 --> 00:44:42,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Miyamoto stated that Link was initially supposed to have a left-handed sword in the Wii version of Twilight Princess, but he has that in the GameCube version, and they changed it so that he uses a sword in the right hand on the Wii because of the fact that most people are right-handed.

670
00:44:42,738 --> 00:44:42,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Well,

671
00:44:43,537 --> 00:44:53,800
[SPEAKER_09]: I always thought it was very strange having Link be left-handed anyway because isn't it in Japan it's sort of a thing where a lot of parents will train their children to be right-handed.

672
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:59,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Being left-handed is very, I guess, considered not very normal.

673
00:44:59,221 --> 00:45:01,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Chatroom's all yelling December 11th, by the way.

674
00:45:01,082 --> 00:45:01,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Chatroom.

675
00:45:01,942 --> 00:45:03,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Why can't they make Tingle less gay then?

676
00:45:04,183 --> 00:45:06,303
[SPEAKER_05]: If they can teach Link to use the other hand.

677
00:45:06,323 --> 00:45:07,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Tingle ain't coming out here.

678
00:45:08,444 --> 00:45:09,124
[SPEAKER_05]: I can say this because

679
00:45:09,522 --> 00:45:11,824
[SPEAKER_05]: I think on GayGamer.net, I want to say, was the site.

680
00:45:12,024 --> 00:45:15,806
[SPEAKER_05]: They're starting a petition right now to get Tingle out over here, because right now it's not planned for release over here.

681
00:45:15,886 --> 00:45:17,267
[SPEAKER_05]: The Tingle Adventure.

682
00:45:17,367 --> 00:45:26,073
[SPEAKER_05]: That uber gay guy in the, well, at least it's, you know, we all think he is, in that GameCube Four Swords Adventures.

683
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:30,056
[SPEAKER_05]: No, actually, he flies by on a balloon and goes, oh!

684
00:45:31,275 --> 00:45:32,576
[SPEAKER_04]: and drops rupees on him.

685
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:34,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he was actually in Wind Waker.

686
00:45:34,597 --> 00:45:35,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's right.

687
00:45:35,717 --> 00:45:36,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, thank you.

688
00:45:36,438 --> 00:45:37,518
[SPEAKER_05]: I just remember him from Four Swords.

689
00:45:37,538 --> 00:45:41,620
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to have to import that because I like... Yeah.

690
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,881
[SPEAKER_05]: You like to feel a little tingle?

691
00:45:44,401 --> 00:45:47,943
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I just like... I like the gay.

692
00:45:49,624 --> 00:45:58,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, speaking of... No, I'm sorry, not speaking of... The interface for the Wii, we've got some very interesting things going on.

693
00:45:58,668 --> 00:45:59,408
[SPEAKER_09]: There is...

694
00:46:01,833 --> 00:46:04,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse me as I die over here.

695
00:46:04,777 --> 00:46:11,144
[SPEAKER_09]: There is going to be, it's actually based on Opera for their web browser.

696
00:46:11,665 --> 00:46:15,650
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a weather channel, a news channel, and then there's one called me channel.

697
00:46:16,611 --> 00:46:19,334
[SPEAKER_09]: M-I-I for those who haven't got the joke yet.

698
00:46:20,828 --> 00:46:49,078
[SPEAKER_09]: with the me channel you can use that to customize your avatar and also your avatar will show up in the various demos you can actually store everything on your Wii remote so you will actually be taking your Wii remote to other people's houses and play which I've been listening to some other podcasts kind of not getting that

699
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:50,342
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

700
00:47:21,364 --> 00:47:37,094
[SPEAKER_09]: There actually, if anyone is interested, there are videos up on Eurogamer.net, linked over from Eurogamer TV, that give demonstrations of how these various screens and channels are going to work on the Wii.

701
00:47:37,515 --> 00:47:39,136
[SPEAKER_09]: So I recommend checking those out.

702
00:47:39,496 --> 00:47:39,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

703
00:47:39,896 --> 00:47:41,778
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know I saw some on Wii.com, too.

704
00:47:41,998 --> 00:47:42,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

705
00:47:42,238 --> 00:47:43,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Some good stuff, too.

706
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:49,303
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to point out this comment, and I know I'm not supposed to say these words because they were banned, but it's a funny comment.

707
00:47:50,036 --> 00:48:05,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Sioran108 in our chatroom says Tingle gets more guys than G4 in regards to Tingle.

708
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:16,257
[SPEAKER_04]: As Jamie mentioned earlier, there's a brand new Wii game which roughly translates to my first Wii.

709
00:48:16,277 --> 00:48:19,360
[SPEAKER_04]: The game's actually going to be bundled with a Wiimote and

710
00:48:20,436 --> 00:48:22,957
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be, yes, my first Wii.

711
00:48:23,237 --> 00:48:24,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody poops!

712
00:48:24,677 --> 00:48:27,318
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, that's translated that wrong.

713
00:48:27,338 --> 00:48:28,538
[SPEAKER_09]: It says starting with Wii.

714
00:48:28,858 --> 00:48:29,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting with Wii.

715
00:48:31,299 --> 00:48:33,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting with Wii, and then you go to poo.

716
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, anyways.

717
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:37,521
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, it's going to be... Wii is number one!

718
00:48:38,381 --> 00:48:39,821
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be bundled... Poo is number two!

719
00:48:41,462 --> 00:48:44,743
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be bundled... I'm glad we got that out of our system.

720
00:48:44,783 --> 00:48:48,844
[SPEAKER_04]: ...together for 4,800 yen, making it cheaper than the standard controller, which would be 5,800 yen.

721
00:48:51,215 --> 00:48:52,836
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's actually kind of cool.

722
00:48:53,296 --> 00:48:57,758
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's set for the Japanese release on December 2nd.

723
00:48:58,179 --> 00:49:14,588
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll include, of course, mini-games designed to make players familiar with the Wii remote controls, including pinball, table hockey, and pool, simple point-and-click shooting games, and other games that are modeled after the demos shown at E3 and

724
00:49:15,888 --> 00:49:20,731
[SPEAKER_04]: including a minigame where you move your Mii caricature around a city block.

725
00:49:22,072 --> 00:49:24,113
[SPEAKER_04]: So, interesting.

726
00:49:24,433 --> 00:49:24,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

727
00:49:25,313 --> 00:49:34,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, one thing that the Wii is going to be able to do that is kind of interesting, and it's kind of interesting that Xbox 360 doesn't do this, and I don't know if PlayStation has plans to do this, but that's surfing the web.

728
00:49:35,219 --> 00:49:45,665
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can see where Xbox 360 doesn't do this, because they want you to go use Windows on your PC to go, you know, surf the internet, but Nintendo, you know, they don't have a PC stake, so they say, fuck that, you're going to surf the web on our, uh,

729
00:49:46,069 --> 00:49:46,709
[SPEAKER_05]: www.darksakura.com

730
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:09,800
[SPEAKER_05]: No idea why they're doing it that way.

731
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:15,745
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought at first when I read this, this meant that the browser wasn't going to be out until June of next year, but that's not what the internet seems to be reporting right now.

732
00:50:15,765 --> 00:50:20,369
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems to be saying that, yeah, the Opera browser will be there, and you can download it free, but in June of next year, you're going to have to pay for it.

733
00:50:21,209 --> 00:50:24,232
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I guess a bonus incentive to early adopters of the Wii?

734
00:50:24,372 --> 00:50:24,772
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess.

735
00:50:25,433 --> 00:50:32,919
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing, too, is, I mean, it's probably not that expensive to develop the Opera browser in the sense that it's normally free anyways.

736
00:50:34,042 --> 00:50:35,283
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably why they're charging after.

737
00:50:35,303 --> 00:50:40,146
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like the whole thing that they did with Texas Hold'em, where it's free for 48 hours.

738
00:50:40,166 --> 00:50:42,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but Texas Hold'em was free for two days.

739
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:44,248
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be free for about seven months.

740
00:50:44,609 --> 00:50:49,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, not a lot of people are going to be really jumping to download the browser.

741
00:50:49,912 --> 00:50:56,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, I mean, if you think about it, to browse the internet, you really got to have a wireless setup and all that stuff.

742
00:50:57,379 --> 00:51:03,922
[SPEAKER_05]: For the Wii, so... Well, wait, but isn't the Wii supposed to have the wireless thing built into it, just like your DS, so that all you have to have is a wireless router in your house and it'll go?

743
00:51:04,062 --> 00:51:07,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, but still, though, I mean, not a lot of people have that, I would think.

744
00:51:07,303 --> 00:51:11,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think people without wireless internet are going to be screwed, or do you think there'll be a dongle like there was for DS?

745
00:51:11,085 --> 00:51:12,705
[SPEAKER_04]: No, there's going to be a USB type of thing.

746
00:51:12,785 --> 00:51:14,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Same that they had with the DS.

747
00:51:14,166 --> 00:51:14,726
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I figured.

748
00:51:15,987 --> 00:51:20,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, speaking of things that are screwed up... Monkey Ball.

749
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:21,629
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

750
00:51:21,649 --> 00:51:21,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

751
00:51:22,188 --> 00:51:24,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Monkey Ball is just one of those crazy games that's out there.

752
00:51:24,269 --> 00:51:30,190
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, as everyone knows by now, there is a Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz that will be out on the Wii.

753
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:35,032
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're introducing two new characters, one called Yan Yan and one called Doctor.

754
00:51:36,692 --> 00:51:39,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Yan Yan is a female monkey.

755
00:51:40,093 --> 00:51:41,773
[SPEAKER_09]: And Yan Yan is a doctor.

756
00:51:42,273 --> 00:51:47,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, Doctor is an older monkey with a past steeped in mystery due to his acute case of amnesia.

757
00:51:47,575 --> 00:51:47,995
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a quote.

758
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:49,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Is his name Dr. Seuss?

759
00:51:50,596 --> 00:51:51,336
[SPEAKER_09]: He just says Doctor.

760
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:56,691
[SPEAKER_09]: And in my head, I'm a Doctor Who fangirl, so every time I see Doctor, I think, David Tennant?

761
00:51:57,071 --> 00:51:57,311
[SPEAKER_09]: No!

762
00:51:57,931 --> 00:52:00,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I have this image of David Tennant dressed as a monkey in my head.

763
00:52:01,232 --> 00:52:01,572
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't.

764
00:52:01,992 --> 00:52:03,012
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I need to wash my brain.

765
00:52:04,973 --> 00:52:06,013
[SPEAKER_09]: David Tennant's hot, but anyway.

766
00:52:06,933 --> 00:52:07,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Okie dokie.

767
00:52:07,373 --> 00:52:08,033
[SPEAKER_09]: So is Billy Piper.

768
00:52:08,533 --> 00:52:10,154
[SPEAKER_09]: But back to the story.

769
00:52:11,574 --> 00:52:21,216
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also, each of these characters are going to have different strengths and weaknesses, things that affect acceleration, speed, jumping, also the weight and size of the ball that they are in.

770
00:52:21,767 --> 00:52:24,730
[SPEAKER_09]: is going to affect how it's played.

771
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:28,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, you use the ball in different ways.

772
00:52:28,473 --> 00:52:29,914
[SPEAKER_09]: You can flick the remote.

773
00:52:29,974 --> 00:52:31,015
[SPEAKER_09]: You can press a button.

774
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:34,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Different things that you do with the remote are going to affect how the balls move.

775
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:39,161
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's also a bunch of mini-games.

776
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:42,524
[SPEAKER_09]: It will be out on December 2nd in Japan.

777
00:52:43,585 --> 00:52:47,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, the grade schooler in me is using the Wii to make your balls move.

778
00:52:47,228 --> 00:52:49,550
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just too much for me.

779
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:50,771
[SPEAKER_05]: It will be a launch game.

780
00:52:51,178 --> 00:53:01,003
[SPEAKER_05]: So, in all territories I just want to say some chat comments real quick PooEater on the Opera Story in our chatroom says Why would you want the internet on your console which has to run from your computer's internet connection?

781
00:53:01,563 --> 00:53:10,908
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, there's something to be said about multiple browser windows Maybe mom wants one browsing window and you want one, I don't know And also, I mean, browsing from your couch and PORN!

782
00:53:11,068 --> 00:53:11,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on!

783
00:53:12,288 --> 00:53:13,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I can't wait to put porn on my Wii

784
00:53:14,302 --> 00:53:18,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Raven's Dolphin wanted to correct me and say that PlayStation 3 does indeed have a browser in it.

785
00:53:18,143 --> 00:53:18,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

786
00:53:18,564 --> 00:53:19,244
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't remember.

787
00:53:19,344 --> 00:53:22,965
[SPEAKER_05]: I figured as much because PSP has one, but I couldn't remember for sure.

788
00:53:24,766 --> 00:53:35,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, speaking of the browser, they are testing the online service, or I should say it's rumored that they are beta testing the online service right now.

789
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:41,692
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how reputable this is, but this is according to a poster on the MacRumorsForum.com.

790
00:53:42,682 --> 00:53:43,982
[SPEAKER_04]: I have problems with that right there.

791
00:53:44,383 --> 00:53:48,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, who has fairly reputable history when it comes to Nintendo-related information.

792
00:53:49,004 --> 00:53:51,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Why he's posting on Mac... Whatever, anyways.

793
00:53:52,705 --> 00:54:01,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Saying that the beta test is running from September 18th until October 23rd, and the test will be covering the Wii Connect 24, Virtual Console, and other online features.

794
00:54:03,389 --> 00:54:04,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

795
00:54:04,069 --> 00:54:06,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so they're beta testing the online service.

796
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:07,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

797
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:09,451
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's something that they need to do.

798
00:54:10,091 --> 00:54:12,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Since, you know, the console is coming out pretty soon.

799
00:54:14,028 --> 00:54:14,288
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

800
00:54:15,509 --> 00:54:15,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing.

801
00:54:16,709 --> 00:54:18,670
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a really Mac fangirl in the house.

802
00:54:19,451 --> 00:54:19,951
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's not true.

803
00:54:19,991 --> 00:54:20,471
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Macs.

804
00:54:20,531 --> 00:54:21,012
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a Mac.

805
00:54:21,192 --> 00:54:24,513
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting my... Oh, did you see the 24-inch iMacs?

806
00:54:26,875 --> 00:54:27,635
[SPEAKER_01]: The bigger the better.

807
00:54:28,195 --> 00:54:29,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Why do you need something that big?

808
00:54:30,196 --> 00:54:30,737
[SPEAKER_09]: For art.

809
00:54:30,817 --> 00:54:35,199
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm being told that that's not a rumor and that's the truth, apparently.

810
00:54:35,719 --> 00:54:36,680
[SPEAKER_09]: They're 24-inch widescreen iMacs.

811
00:54:41,446 --> 00:54:45,408
[SPEAKER_09]: My internet penis knows no bounds.

812
00:54:46,648 --> 00:54:51,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on, another question that still is up for debate right now.

813
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:55,892
[SPEAKER_05]: We have not really gotten a clear answer on this story, and it has to do with the region-free.

814
00:54:56,012 --> 00:54:57,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Is the damn thing going to be region-free or not?

815
00:54:58,273 --> 00:55:02,515
[SPEAKER_05]: And it seems to be that it's America versus the rest of the world.

816
00:55:03,475 --> 00:55:05,736
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean Nintendo of America versus Nintendo of the rest of the world.

817
00:55:06,038 --> 00:55:08,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Debating on whether the damn thing is going to be region free or not.

818
00:55:08,939 --> 00:55:16,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically what happened is that, okay, Perrin Kaplan, who's the VP of Marketing and Corporate Affairs, she said that yes, like the Nintendo DS, the Wii is going to be free.

819
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:22,441
[SPEAKER_05]: But then, I believe some guy from Europe said that it is not going to be region free.

820
00:55:23,021 --> 00:55:31,483
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and then, I guess to further say what Perrin was saying is that she was saying, well, first party games will be region free, but we'll leave it up to the third party folks what they want to do.

821
00:55:32,063 --> 00:55:32,243
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

822
00:55:32,967 --> 00:55:34,428
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

823
00:55:52,023 --> 00:55:55,006
[SPEAKER_05]: and potentially regionless third party titles was indeed correct.

824
00:55:55,286 --> 00:55:56,927
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wii will be region free.

825
00:55:57,248 --> 00:56:00,270
[SPEAKER_05]: So Nintendo of America is convinced the damn thing is going to be region free.

826
00:56:00,770 --> 00:56:03,673
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know why the rest of the world isn't on the same page.

827
00:56:03,833 --> 00:56:07,216
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope so because I want to get Wii Play and my first Wii.

828
00:56:07,716 --> 00:56:12,961
[SPEAKER_05]: And if something like, you know, Oendan comes out for the Wii, you damn well better believe I want that shit.

829
00:56:13,121 --> 00:56:14,382
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know what though?

830
00:56:15,532 --> 00:56:20,235
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a feeling that even if it's not, we're going to get something like what came out on the GameCube.

831
00:56:23,177 --> 00:56:23,797
[SPEAKER_09]: What was it called?

832
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:28,541
[SPEAKER_09]: The thing that basically overrode the region thing and swapped out the disc.

833
00:56:30,802 --> 00:56:33,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that whole swap trick.

834
00:56:33,084 --> 00:56:34,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Use little hacks to do it.

835
00:56:34,845 --> 00:56:38,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially if Nintendo's letting you on the internet with their console.

836
00:56:38,547 --> 00:56:41,529
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what a huge fucking hole that's going to be, I bet, to hackers?

837
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:44,311
[SPEAKER_09]: The whole thing about Nintendo...

838
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:51,977
[SPEAKER_09]: All of their systems have been the easiest to play imports on.

839
00:56:52,157 --> 00:56:57,042
[SPEAKER_09]: For Super Famicom games, all you needed to do was find an old Gyromite.

840
00:56:57,503 --> 00:57:01,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Not for Super Famicom, but for Famicom, you needed an old Gyromite and you could plug it in.

841
00:57:02,126 --> 00:57:05,790
[SPEAKER_09]: or with the Super Nintendo, you break out two little tabs, plug it in.

842
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:13,758
[SPEAKER_09]: With the Nintendo 64, they sold actually a little tool that you could unscrew and then you pop another tab, put it in.

843
00:57:14,378 --> 00:57:18,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Those were all physical lockouts until they started moving to digital format.

844
00:57:19,083 --> 00:57:22,446
[SPEAKER_09]: And then with that, it was still something as easy as loading a code.

845
00:57:22,466 --> 00:57:24,268
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like the Dreamcast, how easy that was.

846
00:57:24,798 --> 00:57:32,200
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I have a feeling that even if they go back and it's all region coded, they're still going to have some way to bypass that.

847
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,360
[SPEAKER_09]: And I really don't think Nintendo's going to care.

848
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:36,501
[SPEAKER_09]: They haven't cared before, really.

849
00:57:37,181 --> 00:57:38,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Why should they really care?

850
00:57:39,181 --> 00:57:40,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby Blackwolf's in our chat right now.

851
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:42,462
[SPEAKER_05]: He does his own show over on allgames.com.

852
00:57:42,482 --> 00:57:46,083
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure if you've listened to this show for any length of time, you've heard us pimp him before.

853
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:55,673
[SPEAKER_05]: He ran the same story on his show tonight, except he was reading Joystick's version of it, and I guess Joystick talked to Nintendo as well, and they told him, no, it's not region free.

854
00:57:56,034 --> 00:58:00,658
[SPEAKER_05]: So, shit, even with the Nintendo of America, they don't know.

855
00:58:02,219 --> 00:58:04,982
[SPEAKER_05]: So we won't know until the damn thing comes out, it sounds like.

856
00:58:05,282 --> 00:58:05,942
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what, though?

857
00:58:06,203 --> 00:58:07,844
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm still really...

858
00:58:09,426 --> 00:58:13,069
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't be too upset about that because there's going to be a way.

859
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:14,250
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there'll be a way.

860
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:28,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if Nintendo doesn't do something, even if we don't have a developer do something, there is going to be some importer on the net, the same people who probably figured out how to do the seven swap trick on the old PlayStation, who will figure out a way to play imports.

861
00:58:28,103 --> 00:58:30,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's just like the Xbox 360 games.

862
00:58:30,505 --> 00:58:33,188
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some that come out that are region-free, and then you can import them.

863
00:58:33,508 --> 00:58:35,750
[SPEAKER_04]: You just won't know until they come out, so...

864
00:58:36,818 --> 00:58:39,419
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it's one of those things they didn't think people were going to ask about.

865
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:42,360
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you mean you want games from other regions?

866
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:43,141
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell is wrong with you?

867
00:58:43,521 --> 00:58:46,362
[SPEAKER_09]: They know there are importers there.

868
00:58:46,402 --> 00:58:52,565
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember paying $125 for the Sailor Moon S fighting game back in 1995.

869
00:58:52,885 --> 00:58:54,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you're fucking sick.

870
00:58:56,446 --> 00:58:58,767
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean that with lots of love.

871
00:58:58,787 --> 00:59:02,229
[SPEAKER_09]: This was when it was brand new and I had to pay import fees.

872
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:09,096
[SPEAKER_09]: and I paid for it and I bought it and I played the hell out of it and sold it back used for $60 after two years.

873
00:59:09,917 --> 00:59:15,882
[SPEAKER_09]: But still, there are people out there who will lay down the money and will do what it takes to get their imports out.

874
00:59:16,983 --> 00:59:17,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

875
00:59:17,844 --> 00:59:24,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, some of the news that was coming out of Japan was actually a huge list of games that they're going to be getting for the Wii.

876
00:59:24,329 --> 00:59:26,491
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought there was a lot of stuff that was very interesting in there.

877
00:59:27,252 --> 00:59:29,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the titles, at least the highlights on there,

878
00:59:30,676 --> 00:59:34,619
[SPEAKER_04]: some to-be-announced titles, for example.

879
00:59:34,979 --> 00:59:39,903
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an action game, an action RPG that's being worked on from software.

880
00:59:40,603 --> 00:59:45,747
[SPEAKER_04]: A baseball game being worked on by Konami Digital Entertainment, so that might be interesting.

881
00:59:46,868 --> 00:59:50,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Bomberman Land, Smash Bros., which, of course, we knew was coming.

882
00:59:51,611 --> 00:59:53,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Disaster, also another Nintendo game.

883
00:59:53,492 --> 00:59:57,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Donkey Kong Tarou Jet Race, which is going to be coming out in 2007.

884
00:59:57,916 --> 00:59:58,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Dragon Quest...

885
01:00:01,399 --> 01:00:26,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, The Crystal Bearer from Square Enix New Fire Emblem game from Nintendo As well as Harry Potter from EA, of course Mario Party 8, not a big surprise there Mario Strikers Charge, which had been previously announced This one I thought was very interesting Music Simulation game, of course a working title from Konami Digital Entertainment So, very interesting there

886
01:00:28,015 --> 01:00:30,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Paper Mario Super Paper Mario Super Paper Mario Super Paper Mario

887
01:00:52,193 --> 01:00:54,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Pac-Man Carnival One Piece Unlimited Adventure Wii Music Totsugeki Famicom Wars W

888
01:01:22,695 --> 01:01:24,696
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually do not know what Totokeki means.

889
01:01:25,297 --> 01:01:26,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe someone in chat knows.

890
01:01:26,257 --> 01:01:26,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me see.

891
01:01:27,659 --> 01:01:28,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Advanced Wars.

892
01:01:28,579 --> 01:01:28,980
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

893
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, yeah, so that's what that is.

894
01:01:30,161 --> 01:01:31,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job, Junami.

895
01:01:31,382 --> 01:01:43,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was thinking, because I was like, that sounds familiar, but... My thought, okay, the Konami music game, just bear with me on this, since it's probably something new for the Wii, I would bet this series is cute enough for Nintendo.

896
01:01:43,972 --> 01:01:49,096
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet it's going to be some twisted form of poppin' music, but not with the controller like we know it.

897
01:01:49,156 --> 01:01:50,977
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be like a different type of poppin' music.

898
01:01:51,138 --> 01:01:51,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Theory.

899
01:01:52,259 --> 01:01:54,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, weird-ass theory for me.

900
01:01:54,241 --> 01:01:55,501
[SPEAKER_03]: No theory here.

901
01:01:56,302 --> 01:02:00,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion Sensing Controller, music game, Drum Mania.

902
01:02:01,566 --> 01:02:01,946
[SPEAKER_03]: You think?

903
01:02:02,907 --> 01:02:07,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, you know, they did have one of the demos at E3 was a drumming sim.

904
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:13,415
[SPEAKER_05]: But wasn't, isn't that Wii music thing supposed to be a separate game with the orchestra and that whole thing from Nintendo?

905
01:02:13,435 --> 01:02:15,256
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it has a drumming thing on there.

906
01:02:15,276 --> 01:02:16,817
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wii music is just the orchestra.

907
01:02:17,177 --> 01:02:17,758
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um...

908
01:02:19,045 --> 01:02:19,985
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't know.

909
01:02:20,025 --> 01:02:22,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Chatroom seems to think it's Parapara.

910
01:02:22,106 --> 01:02:23,327
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to get Parapara.

911
01:02:23,367 --> 01:02:25,448
[SPEAKER_09]: The whole Parapara thing is so... Wait, wait, wait.

912
01:02:25,508 --> 01:02:26,248
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't for us.

913
01:02:26,308 --> 01:02:27,309
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Japan we're talking about.

914
01:02:27,329 --> 01:02:27,989
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I'm saying.

915
01:02:28,229 --> 01:02:30,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Parapara is pretty much dead in Japan.

916
01:02:31,070 --> 01:02:34,312
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a fad that lasted for like, what, five years?

917
01:02:34,372 --> 01:02:35,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's something new.

918
01:02:36,893 --> 01:02:38,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it's like ganguro dancing or something.

919
01:02:38,934 --> 01:02:39,334
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

920
01:02:40,194 --> 01:02:42,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, the ganguro did not die with the Parapara.

921
01:02:43,756 --> 01:02:44,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Mambo-Gogo?

922
01:02:44,096 --> 01:02:45,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Mambo-Gogo would be cool.

923
01:02:45,317 --> 01:02:46,297
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be badass.

924
01:02:46,337 --> 01:02:48,498
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, so... Well...

925
01:02:49,102 --> 01:03:02,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of other games, we have coming out for the Virtual Console, Hudson, who loves us so much, will be bringing 30 titles over for Virtual Console.

926
01:03:03,427 --> 01:03:05,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of them will be available at launch.

927
01:03:05,548 --> 01:03:07,169
[SPEAKER_09]: They haven't listed exactly what.

928
01:03:07,809 --> 01:03:15,232
[SPEAKER_09]: My speculation is we will be probably getting the Adventure Island series, probably the various Bombermans.

929
01:03:17,378 --> 01:03:19,460
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are two I definitely think are going to be up there.

930
01:03:21,001 --> 01:03:21,361
[SPEAKER_09]: And Bonk.

931
01:03:22,321 --> 01:03:25,183
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I definitely... Well, especially if they're doing TurboGrafx.

932
01:03:25,843 --> 01:03:27,845
[SPEAKER_09]: You cannot have TurboGrafx without Bonk.

933
01:03:29,225 --> 01:03:30,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Or Air Zonk.

934
01:03:30,486 --> 01:03:31,107
[SPEAKER_09]: That's another good one.

935
01:03:31,127 --> 01:03:32,747
[SPEAKER_09]: This is one that Junomi suggested.

936
01:03:33,288 --> 01:03:34,929
[SPEAKER_09]: But I still want my Adventure Island.

937
01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:40,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, another company that's talking about games coming over to the Wii.

938
01:03:40,552 --> 01:03:45,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, this one kind of leaked out from the ESRB ratings board there.

939
01:03:45,936 --> 01:04:00,066
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a listing for a bunch of different Wii titles for the Virtual Console, including Altered Beast, Columns, Echo the Dolphin, Golden Axe, Ristar, Sonic the Hedgehog, and ToeJam & Earl.

940
01:04:00,947 --> 01:04:02,588
[SPEAKER_04]: All of which are getting an E rating.

941
01:04:03,068 --> 01:04:05,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh god, I can't wait to play ToeJam & Earl again.

942
01:04:06,089 --> 01:04:10,013
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think, though, about the whole $5, $8, $10 thing?

943
01:04:10,033 --> 01:04:11,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think that's going to be worth it for those old games?

944
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:14,777
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't really say where Genesis and TurboGrafx fits into that, though.

945
01:04:14,797 --> 01:04:21,763
[SPEAKER_05]: They just said, you know, 500 points for the old games, 800 for the SNES, and 1,000 for the later ones, Nintendo 64.

946
01:04:21,943 --> 01:04:26,147
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I do, though, have to second something that was mentioned in the chat room.

947
01:04:27,408 --> 01:04:30,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Bob Coffee said we need to get Dracula X. All right.

948
01:04:31,175 --> 01:04:41,720
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to get one of our biggest Nintendo fans on the Skype line right now because he's dying to comment on some of this because he knows a few things that we don't and we're going to see what we can get out of him here on the show.

949
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:43,260
[SPEAKER_05]: DMN, are you on the line?

950
01:04:44,161 --> 01:04:46,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you got your $20 bills out?

951
01:04:46,322 --> 01:04:47,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Why, are you going to dance?

952
01:04:49,083 --> 01:04:49,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

953
01:04:49,703 --> 01:04:51,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you dress up for this phone call?

954
01:04:52,664 --> 01:04:53,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, what?

955
01:04:53,585 --> 01:04:54,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you dress up for this phone call?

956
01:04:54,885 --> 01:04:56,466
[SPEAKER_05]: He's dressed sexy for episode 200.

957
01:04:56,546 --> 01:04:58,467
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually not wearing any clothes right now.

958
01:05:02,205 --> 01:05:06,447
[SPEAKER_05]: D.M.N., I know you're dying to comment on this.

959
01:05:06,507 --> 01:05:08,008
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think about all this news this week?

960
01:05:08,048 --> 01:05:11,310
[SPEAKER_05]: And now you can actually talk about some of the things you couldn't before, I'm sure.

961
01:05:12,310 --> 01:05:13,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a few things.

962
01:05:13,231 --> 01:05:19,354
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things I want to say is this is the most excited I've been for a console launch since about Nintendo 64.

963
01:05:21,548 --> 01:05:31,256
[SPEAKER_05]: I would agree with that, except I would go as far back to say I have not been this excited about a console at launch, keeping those words in mind, at launch, since Super Nintendo.

964
01:05:32,077 --> 01:05:32,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's another one.

965
01:05:35,019 --> 01:05:47,590
[SPEAKER_02]: What I want to say about the Wii is, you know, having had a chance to dabble playing it a little bit, we did have a little demo thing over the week for all Nintendo employees.

966
01:05:48,350 --> 01:05:49,751
[SPEAKER_02]: It's incredibly fun.

967
01:05:51,454 --> 01:05:53,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Elebits, looks amazing.

968
01:05:54,697 --> 01:05:57,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Got a chance to try out a demo of WarioWare, which is amazing.

969
01:05:57,599 --> 01:05:58,320
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really fun.

970
01:06:01,242 --> 01:06:08,688
[SPEAKER_02]: What else can I... Madden 07, I got to play like a couple plays of that, and that may be the most fun anybody will have with a sim sports game ever.

971
01:06:08,888 --> 01:06:10,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you biased because you're on Reggie's payroll?

972
01:06:11,571 --> 01:06:11,771
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

973
01:06:12,712 --> 01:06:12,912
[SPEAKER_05]: No?

974
01:06:13,552 --> 01:06:13,692
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

975
01:06:13,712 --> 01:06:14,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Swear to me.

976
01:06:15,034 --> 01:06:16,355
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting a 360 at some point.

977
01:06:16,595 --> 01:06:17,796
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just not getting a PS3.

978
01:06:17,896 --> 01:06:19,097
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're in the Wii 60 camp?

979
01:06:19,818 --> 01:06:20,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

980
01:06:20,218 --> 01:06:20,418
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

981
01:06:21,004 --> 01:06:21,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.

982
01:06:21,805 --> 01:06:22,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what else?

983
01:06:22,705 --> 01:06:24,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else you can tell us about the Wii?

984
01:06:24,967 --> 01:06:25,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe?

985
01:06:25,528 --> 01:06:25,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Little bits?

986
01:06:25,928 --> 01:06:26,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Little hints?

987
01:06:27,429 --> 01:06:39,419
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to see... I don't want to get you fired, so I understand if no, but... There's not really anything else I can talk about because I know just about as much as you guys do in some aspects.

988
01:06:41,521 --> 01:06:45,304
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's some things I can't talk about because of obvious reasons.

989
01:06:45,564 --> 01:06:45,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

990
01:06:46,785 --> 01:06:46,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

991
01:06:48,618 --> 01:06:49,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's about it.

992
01:06:49,638 --> 01:06:49,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

993
01:06:50,118 --> 01:06:50,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, that's cool.

994
01:06:50,878 --> 01:06:56,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we'll take your word for it, because you've probably seen the Wii more recently than any of the rest of us, so... Yeah.

995
01:06:56,479 --> 01:06:58,400
[SPEAKER_05]: So you actually got hands-on with Elebits?

996
01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:05,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I saw it at the Konami thing, but I didn't get to play it, really, because all the Corpcasts were hogging the shit out of it, and we weren't really able to get on it.

997
01:07:05,941 --> 01:07:09,161
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say, right here and now, it will be a Katamari Damacy killer.

998
01:07:09,762 --> 01:07:11,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, I don't know about that.

999
01:07:11,602 --> 01:07:12,222
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about that.

1000
01:07:12,242 --> 01:07:14,462
[SPEAKER_02]: I will put money on that with you, Rob.

1001
01:07:14,602 --> 01:07:15,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, you saw this, too?

1002
01:07:15,723 --> 01:07:17,963
[SPEAKER_05]: You think Elebits is the Katamari killer?

1003
01:07:18,502 --> 01:07:19,062
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

1004
01:07:19,242 --> 01:07:19,522
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1005
01:07:20,022 --> 01:07:20,223
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1006
01:07:20,423 --> 01:07:20,903
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

1007
01:07:20,963 --> 01:07:21,443
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun.

1008
01:07:21,523 --> 01:07:23,443
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to appeal to the same type of people.

1009
01:07:23,543 --> 01:07:27,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think it's going to appeal to the same crowd, but I don't think it'll sell nearly as many copies.

1010
01:07:27,224 --> 01:07:28,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, they do need to release Katamari for it, though.

1011
01:07:29,165 --> 01:07:29,445
[SPEAKER_04]: They do.

1012
01:07:29,945 --> 01:07:30,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it'll be interesting.

1013
01:07:30,705 --> 01:07:34,086
[SPEAKER_09]: But it won't be the same guy, because he said he's not doing any more Katamari.

1014
01:07:34,186 --> 01:07:34,767
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's true.

1015
01:07:35,147 --> 01:07:35,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cares?

1016
01:07:35,827 --> 01:07:36,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Just port it.

1017
01:07:37,507 --> 01:07:39,428
[SPEAKER_05]: What makes you think that Elebits is a Katamari killer?

1018
01:07:40,899 --> 01:07:42,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Just how incredibly fun it was.

1019
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,300
[SPEAKER_02]: It was easy to just pick up and play.

1020
01:07:44,481 --> 01:07:49,683
[SPEAKER_02]: It took me maybe 30 seconds just to get used to what I was doing, and it was clockwork from there.

1021
01:07:50,123 --> 01:07:52,704
[SPEAKER_02]: It felt just as fun as a Katamari game and just as simple.

1022
01:07:53,004 --> 01:07:56,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that how most Wii games are designed, though, that you just kind of pick it up and go?

1023
01:07:56,785 --> 01:07:58,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.

1024
01:07:59,046 --> 01:08:07,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, for those who don't know, Elevates is basically a game where, let's say you're playing Half-Life 2 in just a random part of the neighborhood, and the only thing you have is the gravity gun.

1025
01:08:07,729 --> 01:08:08,850
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much what it is.

1026
01:08:09,410 --> 01:08:09,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

1027
01:08:10,262 --> 01:08:12,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1028
01:08:13,963 --> 01:08:18,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Will I be able to sell a Wii to my mom?

1029
01:08:18,264 --> 01:08:18,845
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want.

1030
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:23,166
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, is this really the type of console that's going to appeal to everyone, you think?

1031
01:08:23,886 --> 01:08:24,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, absolutely.

1032
01:08:25,747 --> 01:08:33,689
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually telling my own mother about it, who absolutely loves video games, and she actually even seemed interested in trying it when I bought it.

1033
01:08:34,129 --> 01:08:38,211
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that this is the direction that gaming needs to go.

1034
01:08:38,591 --> 01:08:39,251
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to

1035
01:08:39,827 --> 01:08:44,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Be more a part of the game rather than, you know, I don't want top-notch graphics.

1036
01:08:45,230 --> 01:08:47,852
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want incredibly difficult controls.

1037
01:08:47,892 --> 01:08:50,874
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want a game I can pick up and play and enjoy and have fun with.

1038
01:08:51,274 --> 01:08:52,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, interesting.

1039
01:08:52,295 --> 01:09:00,480
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why we're not seeing as much of the 360, and from what Sony's doing, it's just not looking like it.

1040
01:09:01,286 --> 01:09:01,566
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1041
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:04,209
[SPEAKER_05]: But what do you think might happen with Sony in a year?

1042
01:09:04,269 --> 01:09:15,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Because remember, the PlayStation and PlayStation 2 launches, I think for people who play the same type of games we do, we're not really in the we buy Madden games the day they come out camp.

1043
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:20,603
[SPEAKER_05]: And granted, there's a great fan base for that, and I'm not knocking that if that's what you're into.

1044
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:29,949
[SPEAKER_05]: But do you think that maybe for us who are more of the, you know, we like to play quirky music games and Japanese RPGs camp, do you think that Sony might win us over in a year?

1045
01:09:30,009 --> 01:09:38,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I truly believe it right now that Sony may be able to shnagle a price drop and some great games in a year that, you know, don't count PS3 out.

1046
01:09:40,017 --> 01:09:41,979
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to be as open-minded as possible about this.

1047
01:09:42,599 --> 01:09:44,420
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely wouldn't count Sony out.

1048
01:09:44,501 --> 01:09:46,242
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the price that's killing them.

1049
01:09:46,362 --> 01:09:50,085
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if they release a Final Fantasy and a Kingdom Hearts, yeah, absolutely.

1050
01:09:50,125 --> 01:09:50,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are going to sell PS3s.

1051
01:09:51,486 --> 01:09:52,126
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1052
01:09:53,568 --> 01:09:57,551
[SPEAKER_02]: I know tons of people who, if Kingdom Hearts 3 comes out, they will drop what they're doing and go buy a PS3.

1053
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:57,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris?

1054
01:09:58,491 --> 01:09:59,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris is nodding her head.

1055
01:09:59,392 --> 01:09:59,812
[SPEAKER_05]: That's me.

1056
01:09:59,973 --> 01:10:00,313
[SPEAKER_05]: That's me.

1057
01:10:01,474 --> 01:10:01,734
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1058
01:10:01,954 --> 01:10:04,856
[SPEAKER_05]: DMM, we've got to let you go because we've got to get to our next round of DDR sneak peeks.

1059
01:10:04,876 --> 01:10:06,077
[SPEAKER_05]: But thanks so much for calling in.

1060
01:10:06,117 --> 01:10:06,658
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate it.

1061
01:10:07,298 --> 01:10:08,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, one more thing.

1062
01:10:08,399 --> 01:10:08,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1063
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:09,060
[SPEAKER_02]: One more thing.

1064
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:09,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes?

1065
01:10:09,912 --> 01:10:19,155
[SPEAKER_02]: While we're talking about the Wii, you all need to listen to Orange Lounge Radio on November the 19th because I will be in studio with a Wii to give to somebody.

1066
01:10:20,095 --> 01:10:25,017
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other thing, since he couldn't share some info about the Wii, I figured I could.

1067
01:10:25,559 --> 01:10:27,040
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1068
01:10:54,022 --> 01:10:54,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks so much.

1069
01:10:54,602 --> 01:10:55,542
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a true fan, DMM.

1070
01:10:55,582 --> 01:10:55,902
[SPEAKER_05]: We love you.

1071
01:10:56,683 --> 01:10:56,943
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1072
01:10:57,043 --> 01:10:57,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care, guys.

1073
01:10:57,623 --> 01:10:58,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one, buddy.

1074
01:10:58,183 --> 01:10:58,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

1075
01:10:58,803 --> 01:10:58,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

1076
01:10:59,003 --> 01:11:00,983
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you know on release dates?

1077
01:11:01,304 --> 01:11:10,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, as we know, there's only really two Nintendo first-party titles that are launching with Wii in the United States, including Excite Truck and, of course, Zelda Twilight Princess.

1078
01:11:11,186 --> 01:11:21,488
[SPEAKER_04]: However, shortly afterwards, we will be getting the next in first-party games, which will be WarioWare Smooth Moves, which is coming to us on January 16, 2007.

1079
01:11:23,906 --> 01:11:33,709
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing which is very interesting, as I mentioned before, Sonic the Secret of the Rings, of course not a launch title, also confirmed by the launch games that were coming out.

1080
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:38,371
[SPEAKER_04]: It is in the launch window, I guess, but it's coming out March 7th, 2007.

1081
01:11:38,451 --> 01:11:44,593
[SPEAKER_04]: So lots of big stuff coming from Sega in March, and I'll get into that a little bit later.

1082
01:11:45,453 --> 01:11:49,555
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, Super Paper Mario, delayed on the GameCube until the 15th of December.

1083
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:53,102
[SPEAKER_04]: possibly on the Wii in the United States.

1084
01:11:53,382 --> 01:11:53,742
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1085
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:55,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of foggy on that.

1086
01:11:56,084 --> 01:11:56,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1087
01:11:56,885 --> 01:11:57,205
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1088
01:11:57,705 --> 01:12:00,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think that about covers all the Wii news we wanted to do tonight.

1089
01:12:00,628 --> 01:12:06,672
[SPEAKER_05]: So now I want to go around to everybody, our guests included, and I want to ask you guys, what do you think now after all this news?

1090
01:12:06,792 --> 01:12:07,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you sold on the Wii?

1091
01:12:08,213 --> 01:12:10,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Were you disappointed with the news you heard this week?

1092
01:12:10,615 --> 01:12:12,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Or are you happy with the news you heard this week?

1093
01:12:13,057 --> 01:12:15,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Is Nintendo going to win the next round of the console wars?

1094
01:12:16,119 --> 01:12:16,640
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think?

1095
01:12:16,820 --> 01:12:18,401
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll start it off with Drew.

1096
01:12:18,541 --> 01:12:19,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Drew Nami, what do you think?

1097
01:12:20,656 --> 01:12:29,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Personally, I've been sold on the Wii since the E3 announcements, but I know there's a lot of anti-Nintendo people out there.

1098
01:12:29,619 --> 01:12:32,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Despite all that, I think Nintendo's got the routine down pat.

1099
01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:35,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Do one thing, do it really well, do it with innovation.

1100
01:12:36,641 --> 01:12:41,862
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're definitely going to score second, if not first, in the console wars for this generation.

1101
01:12:43,043 --> 01:12:43,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

1102
01:12:45,383 --> 01:12:47,744
[SPEAKER_04]: The only disappointment I have is that it's not coming out sooner.

1103
01:12:48,804 --> 01:12:52,725
[SPEAKER_04]: The price is fine, because I figured that's about the price I was going to pay for it anyways.

1104
01:12:52,785 --> 01:13:02,067
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know I've got to buy lots of accessories for it, because I take this thing to work, I play with my friends, and I've got to have enough controllers for everybody, because they're broke asses.

1105
01:13:02,507 --> 01:13:04,487
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, that's fine.

1106
01:13:06,228 --> 01:13:10,028
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing I'm just worried about is I want to make sure I get one on launch.

1107
01:13:10,128 --> 01:13:13,649
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my only concern right now, and I'm trying to cover my bases with that.

1108
01:13:14,478 --> 01:13:21,180
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm really hoping that they, you know, I do like what they've got coming out as far as games and stuff.

1109
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:24,100
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're going to see a lot of really cool, innovative things with it.

1110
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:27,321
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very interested to see these Wii channels.

1111
01:13:27,381 --> 01:13:35,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really give a crap about the news too much, but, you know, some of the stuff's pretty cool, like the photo channel.

1112
01:13:35,363 --> 01:13:35,963
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty neat.

1113
01:13:36,663 --> 01:13:36,863
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1114
01:13:37,587 --> 01:13:39,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Some quick chat comments, then we'll get Chris's feedback.

1115
01:13:40,350 --> 01:13:47,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Knights in our chat says, The two weeks when Gears of War, the PS3, and the Wii come out, I will feel sorry for everyone at GameStop and EB Games.

1116
01:13:48,336 --> 01:13:52,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Anush in our chat says, I think Sony is going to make it again, but I have no problem with Nintendo.

1117
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,602
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll buy a Wii, too, but Sony comes before Microsoft for me.

1118
01:13:56,103 --> 01:13:56,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris, what are your thoughts?

1119
01:13:57,544 --> 01:13:57,864
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1120
01:13:57,904 --> 01:14:03,949
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really get sold on games or the systems that they come with too easily.

1121
01:14:04,109 --> 01:14:06,291
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds cool, but I don't know if I'm going to get one at launch.

1122
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:11,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Just because I'm really picky about the games that I do have.

1123
01:14:14,121 --> 01:14:19,722
[SPEAKER_07]: Just getting the PS2, which is the only one I've got so far, and some Game Boys.

1124
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:23,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Even that, that took Kingdom Hearts to go get.

1125
01:14:24,403 --> 01:14:27,023
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got to be a good game for me to go get it, so I probably won't get it at launch.

1126
01:14:27,043 --> 01:14:32,784
[SPEAKER_07]: But it sounds really good, and I'm sure you're going to hear Megzi talk about it constantly, so I'll get enough news from it.

1127
01:14:32,965 --> 01:14:34,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing, my big thing about the Wii...

1128
01:14:36,275 --> 01:14:47,257
[SPEAKER_04]: The vibe I get from the Wii is the same vibe I get from thinking about playing Castle Crashers or old arcade games like the four-player coin-op games.

1129
01:14:47,397 --> 01:14:49,278
[SPEAKER_04]: That kind of vibe where it's fun.

1130
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:55,599
[SPEAKER_04]: You have your friends over, you put some chips on the table or something, and you all play a fun game together.

1131
01:14:55,659 --> 01:14:57,239
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the kind of vibe I get from it.

1132
01:14:57,599 --> 01:14:57,819
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1133
01:14:58,179 --> 01:15:00,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Quick chat comment, then we'll get my thoughts, and then DarkSakura.

1134
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:04,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Bob Coffee says in our chat, I think Nintendo's got it.

1135
01:15:04,501 --> 01:15:05,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony's just making too many mistakes.

1136
01:15:06,325 --> 01:15:08,489
[SPEAKER_05]: The real battle will be here in North America.

1137
01:15:09,811 --> 01:15:10,413
[SPEAKER_05]: My thoughts.

1138
01:15:10,733 --> 01:15:16,865
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, not since the original 8-bit Nintendo has a word...

1139
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:18,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1140
01:15:38,755 --> 01:15:41,697
[SPEAKER_05]: so that, you know, it's going to appeal to everyone.

1141
01:15:41,737 --> 01:15:43,377
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you can just pick this thing up and go.

1142
01:15:43,738 --> 01:15:49,020
[SPEAKER_05]: I do know people that are turned off by Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 because it's just, you know, too many buttons.

1143
01:15:49,381 --> 01:15:50,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Too damn many buttons.

1144
01:15:50,081 --> 01:15:50,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Too much to do.

1145
01:15:51,221 --> 01:15:53,763
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think this is going to be the one that sells it to the families.

1146
01:15:54,023 --> 01:15:59,446
[SPEAKER_05]: I think for the hardcore of hardcore gamers, there's another battle that's going to be fought there between 360 and PS3.

1147
01:15:59,686 --> 01:16:01,006
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think this is what Nintendo wants.

1148
01:16:01,046 --> 01:16:04,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo is trying to go after the casual gamer and I think they're going to get it.

1149
01:16:04,468 --> 01:16:05,889
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the Wii, if not

1150
01:16:06,109 --> 01:16:06,989
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1151
01:16:34,301 --> 01:16:40,443
[SPEAKER_05]: But as long as we consistently are getting new games that keep our interest, I think we've got the potential to do amazingly.

1152
01:16:40,703 --> 01:16:41,543
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, your thoughts?

1153
01:16:42,783 --> 01:16:53,486
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, just to go back to what you were saying about Xerox, I remember there being an ad back in the 80s where Xerox would say, this is not a generic.

1154
01:16:54,186 --> 01:16:55,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Please don't use this as a generic.

1155
01:16:55,607 --> 01:17:00,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendo is on its way to having their entire corporate name being used as a generic term for games.

1156
01:17:01,068 --> 01:17:03,369
[SPEAKER_09]: In terms of business, that hurts them.

1157
01:17:04,270 --> 01:17:10,312
[SPEAKER_09]: So I disagree with that, just after what I've studied in business law.

1158
01:17:11,072 --> 01:17:17,894
[SPEAKER_09]: But I do agree, though, that they have been the big innovators.

1159
01:17:18,754 --> 01:17:21,475
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted a Wii when it was a revolution.

1160
01:17:23,776 --> 01:17:27,517
[SPEAKER_09]: There's never been a doubt that if Nintendo puts out a system, I am going to own it.

1161
01:17:28,803 --> 01:17:37,047
[SPEAKER_09]: So, that's all I... You know, Nintendo could put out a cardboard box and call it the Pooh, and I would buy it.

1162
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:41,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, you're gullible.

1163
01:17:42,050 --> 01:17:42,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Have I ever told you that?

1164
01:17:43,790 --> 01:17:44,331
[SPEAKER_09]: I am not.

1165
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:45,791
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's Nintendo, it's going to be good.

1166
01:17:45,811 --> 01:17:47,312
[SPEAKER_09]: They've always put out quality products.

1167
01:17:47,472 --> 01:17:48,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Pooh is not good!

1168
01:17:49,653 --> 01:17:50,013
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1169
01:17:50,154 --> 01:17:53,295
[SPEAKER_09]: It was an example.

1170
01:17:53,575 --> 01:17:55,036
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't mean to buy Pooh.

1171
01:17:55,956 --> 01:17:57,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well those are our opinions.

1172
01:17:57,539 --> 01:17:58,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Take them or leave them.

1173
01:17:58,702 --> 01:18:02,269
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd love to hear your opinions as well, not only in our chat room, but at our email bag.

1174
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:03,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com

1175
01:18:04,249 --> 01:18:05,170
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1176
01:18:31,451 --> 01:18:32,191
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1177
01:18:55,102 --> 01:18:58,187
[SPEAKER_05]: and tonight we're going to debut one of these power courses for you right now.

1178
01:18:58,228 --> 01:18:59,971
[SPEAKER_05]: This one is from DDR Ultramix 4.

1179
01:19:00,792 --> 01:19:02,255
[SPEAKER_05]: It is power course number 2.

1180
01:19:02,776 --> 01:19:05,742
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the Stargaze mix by DJ Nagi.

1181
01:19:05,802 --> 01:19:06,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Enjoy.

1182
01:20:17,834 --> 01:20:26,607
Listen to the words I'm saying, baby I found the ghost and it keeps me hanging

1183
01:20:47,365 --> 01:20:48,626
Thank you for watching!

1184
01:21:40,429 --> 01:21:41,673
Thanks for watching!

1185
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:48,461
[SPEAKER_05]: from DDR Ultramix 4 here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1186
01:24:48,521 --> 01:24:50,081
[SPEAKER_05]: That is one of the new power courses.

1187
01:24:50,121 --> 01:24:56,342
[SPEAKER_05]: That's power course number two as mixed by DJ Nagi, the Stargaze mix here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1188
01:24:57,223 --> 01:25:01,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I know a lot of you guys are dying to know what songs are in that list.

1189
01:25:01,183 --> 01:25:02,264
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to know what the songs are.

1190
01:25:02,904 --> 01:25:05,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you'll find out when the game's released.

1191
01:25:06,184 --> 01:25:09,005
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the meantime, you'll just have to speculate away.

1192
01:25:09,045 --> 01:25:14,006
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure if you play DDR Ultramix 2, you won't have a hard time figuring out one of the songs in there at least.

1193
01:25:14,923 --> 01:25:17,747
[SPEAKER_05]: But as far as the rest of it goes, we're supposed to keep a lid on it.

1194
01:25:18,207 --> 01:25:19,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry guys, have fun.

1195
01:25:20,551 --> 01:25:25,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyway, we're going to move on and, well, I don't know.

1196
01:25:25,598 --> 01:25:26,419
[SPEAKER_05]: You think we ought to do some more?

1197
01:25:27,861 --> 01:25:28,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

1198
01:25:28,362 --> 01:25:29,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, look, here.

1199
01:25:29,263 --> 01:25:29,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Here.

1200
01:25:30,488 --> 01:25:39,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do some clips from some other courses as well, because I don't want to leave out DDR Universe, because DDR Universe has some non-stops as well, so we've got to show them a little love.

1201
01:25:39,675 --> 01:25:41,476
[SPEAKER_05]: But we are a little pressed for time, so we're going to do some clips.

1202
01:25:41,536 --> 01:25:45,139
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's a clip of one of the non-stops from DDR Universe.

1203
01:25:45,179 --> 01:25:50,163
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the Acid Tech Mix, also by DJ Nagi here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1204
01:26:42,430 --> 01:26:43,230
Thanks for watching!

1205
01:27:09,213 --> 01:27:10,074
Thanks for watching!

1206
01:27:33,576 --> 01:27:34,436
Thanks for watching!

1207
01:28:03,115 --> 01:28:04,216
Thanks for watching!

1208
01:28:47,481 --> 01:28:48,621
Thanks for watching!

1209
01:29:11,986 --> 01:29:12,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we've got to cut it off.

1210
01:29:12,947 --> 01:29:15,468
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't play too much or Konami Hawaii is going to get mad at us.

1211
01:29:15,528 --> 01:29:20,011
[SPEAKER_05]: But here on Orange Launch Radio, that was from DDR Universe, a clip of Power Chorus number one.

1212
01:29:20,612 --> 01:29:24,094
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is called the Acid Tech Mix by DJ Nagi.

1213
01:29:25,515 --> 01:29:29,518
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, DJ Nagi is awesome and all, but we've got to play someone else, I think.

1214
01:29:29,558 --> 01:29:33,320
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to do at least one more chorus so we can play someone else and show a different mixing style.

1215
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:34,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't you agree?

1216
01:29:34,641 --> 01:29:36,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think they'd care if we played one more?

1217
01:29:36,663 --> 01:29:36,843
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1218
01:29:37,043 --> 01:29:37,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well...

1219
01:29:37,557 --> 01:29:38,738
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll do one more clip.

1220
01:29:38,758 --> 01:29:40,920
[SPEAKER_05]: That's another course from DDR Ultramix 4.

1221
01:29:41,540 --> 01:29:48,866
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the Steppin' Out Mix by Stillwind, a little clip so you can check out someone else's mixing skills here on the DDR Sneak Peeks.

1222
01:29:52,309 --> 01:29:53,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1223
01:30:13,694 --> 01:30:15,156
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

1224
01:32:16,593 --> 01:32:34,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we gotta turn it off, or else Konami's gonna write us some hate mail, and I don't wanna screw the rest of the DDR Sneak Peeks, but that was a look there at the Steppin' Out mix by Stillwind from DDR Ultramix 4, and dude, he mixed like happy hardcore into jazz swing 20s music there, I mean...

1225
01:32:35,427 --> 01:32:36,548
[SPEAKER_05]: These courses are going to be nuts.

1226
01:32:36,868 --> 01:32:38,409
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's just a taste of what's to come.

1227
01:32:38,969 --> 01:32:41,571
[SPEAKER_05]: We will continue the DDR sneak peeks next week.

1228
01:32:41,591 --> 01:32:47,354
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to go back and look at two new tracks from DDR Ultramix 4 and two new tracks from DDR Universe.

1229
01:32:47,414 --> 01:32:50,656
[SPEAKER_05]: And that will be next week, episode 201 of Orange Lounge Radio.

1230
01:32:51,429 --> 01:32:57,735
[SPEAKER_05]: We're about ready to go to DDR, I'm sorry, OLR Part B here pretty soon.

1231
01:32:58,295 --> 01:33:02,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, you want to make a quick comment on something you thought was funny about the Supernova VRare, which came out this week?

1232
01:33:02,699 --> 01:33:06,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's actually some interesting stuff about it.

1233
01:33:06,243 --> 01:33:10,867
[SPEAKER_04]: The first thing, of course, the first track is actually a song called

1234
01:33:11,617 --> 01:33:11,997
[SPEAKER_04]: L.E.F.

1235
01:33:38,593 --> 01:33:52,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Which also, there's an artist in DDR called System SF, which created a song called, um, oh god, Feelings Won't Fade, which ripped off a System F song called Out of the Blue, which I thought that was very ironic.

1236
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:58,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I guess they kissed and made up, and, you know, imitation is the highest form of flattery, isn't that what they say?

1237
01:33:58,323 --> 01:34:03,245
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a photocopy of the song, it is that close, but, uh, all right.

1238
01:34:04,535 --> 01:34:08,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

1239
01:34:08,579 --> 01:34:14,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
