Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 198 for this September 3, 2006.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,580
If you're listening to us on the podcast feed, remember that Orange Lounge Radio is distributed

6
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,580
in two parts.

7
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:36,000
Part A rolls out Monday morning and Part B rolls out somewhere between Tuesday and Wednesday

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,160
whenever we feel like it.

9
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,640
You have to go back and listen to Part A to really get the full experience of what's going

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,640
on tonight.

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,320
What is going on tonight is that Loki and I have been partaking in a little bit of alcohol

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,600
because it's a three-day weekend, but please drink responsibly.

13
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,560
Do not follow our example unless you are responsible like we are.

14
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:59,640
We have Mikl Tov here, who's completely sober, our special guest tonight, babysitting us.

15
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,620
So go back to part A and catch up on your Orange Lounge radio, and for now, we'll get

16
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:08,640
back into the gaming news on this part B. Loki, start it off.

17
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,960
Okay, anyways, to start things off, like I said in part A, I've been playing some Saints

18
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,840
Row, and got some good news, there's new download content coming soon.

19
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,760
Now this content I'm not sure if it's going to be downloadable through live or through

20
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:29,700
like kiosks because if you remember correctly and this really hasn't been advertised too

21
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,540
much but the demo kiosks that are in like you know your best buys and your game stops

22
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:39,680
and whatnot they actually do have content you can download off of there onto a memory

23
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,120
you know card so if you do happen to have you know one of the memory units for the 360

24
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,320
you might be able to get some good stuff including some brand new outfits and clothing for your

25
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:55,440
Saints Row characters, including such wacky things like a samurai helmet, a leather eyepatch,

26
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:02,440
a fake tuxedo t-shirt, which is awesome, some tropical shirt. Can you get a Moomoo like

27
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:07,440
you can in Dead Rising, because that is the best costume ever. Possibly, but not yet at

28
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:14,120
least. You can get a spiked leather jacket. Who made Saints Row, THQ? Dear THQ, Moomoo,

29
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:21,360
Please, thanks, love Skye, orange lounge. Anywho, you've also got leopard slash tiger

30
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:30,860
skin boxers, leather chaps, crazy bunny slippers, a skull ring, a saints row medallion and saints

31
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:36,340
row wristband, as well as some tattoos, they have a large and small panther, rattlesnake,

32
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:41,300
biohazard sign, an unk, and a spider.

33
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:46,500
So that's pretty sweet and apparently you can get it pretty soon.

34
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,540
They've already got some screenshots of these things, including someone who's wearing all

35
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,580
of them at the same time and he looks like a freak.

36
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,580
Awesome.

37
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:59,180
Now of course some folks are noticing the Saints Row has a few problems with it.

38
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,660
Now Volition, one of the developers of the game there, they are aware of the problems

39
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,220
and they are working on a patch right now.

40
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,380
These are things that are supposed to be in the patch.

41
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:12,320
Improvements to the way the game handles packet loss and bandwidth management between players.

42
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:17,380
This will address lag and general synchronization problems between the player's clients and

43
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,420
so on.

44
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,260
The system for rating a player's quality of service has been improved and made less conservative.

45
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,780
This means you'll see many more matches with 10-12 player limits.

46
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:31,820
Fix for the closed stealing exploit in multiplayer, fix for widescreen formatting issues and certain

47
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,860
resolutions and changes to the matchmaking phase.

48
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,360
to get players in the game faster.

49
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,200
Yeah, it is kind of.

50
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,020
Kind of like that first,

51
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,760
you remember that first Halo 2 patch did a lot of that.

52
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,300
That's good, because I know the multiplayer

53
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,300
as it is right now, at least the game I played

54
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,240
was pretty unplayable, so.

55
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,280
You know on my friends list on Xbox Live,

56
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,120
Saints Row is easily the most popular game right now.

57
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,440
Nobody ever plays Final Fantasy XI on my friends list.

58
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,720
I've seen maybe one other person playing Enchanted Arms.

59
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,560
And you know what?

60
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,400
What?

61
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,200
And we do have a gang on Saints Row.

62
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,260
The O.L. Army is there.

63
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,900
and um... all you need to do it's pretty simple

64
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,860
let me know if you've got the game you know send an invite if you're not a

65
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,460
friend of uh... loki oler already

66
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,460
um... and basically what i'll do is i'll send an invite to join the gang and i've

67
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,320
done that already

68
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,580
even with people there's a thread in our forums right at orange I'll show you there's a

69
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:24,220
thread but even even people like i see em playing saints row i'll send em an

70
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,900
invite i'll jump in the game real quick and send an invite

71
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,140
so

72
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,540
try that out i mean i'm just trying to get some people to join up

73
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:37,120
Obviously, we're not really going all hardcore at this but you know, I think later on down the line

74
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,100
It'd be fun to do a multiplayer game, you know, maybe deathmatch versus everyone be kind of fun. So I

75
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:47,560
Don't know something to think about fun game though multiplayer. Yeah, I'm curious to get out. I notice other

76
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,900
Podcasters on my friends list are playing the hell out of this game like gamer Andy

77
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,900
I don't think I've seen playing anything else but this

78
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,620
God-free from gamertag has been playing a crap load of Saints Row

79
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:02,800
So I think we need to form a gang and take some of those guys on in a multi podcast tournament

80
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,800
Hopefully it will work this time. I'm like a

81
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,840
This is my only

82
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,560
Stimulation no teams if it is gonna be something I want to be like an all-out grudge match

83
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,080
You know, like, you know eight people on eight people eight people against each other, you know

84
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:22,360
So you can have a couple people from each podcast, but everyone for themselves. All right, we'll see what happens. We'll see what happens

85
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,960
so now

86
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,620
We're gonna get into some release dates. Yes Loki if you don't have Saints Row yet

87
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,860
There might be some other games you can get soon. There are some other games for the u.s. Lots of stuff actually coming out

88
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:41,360
This week, of course, if you're a NASCAR fan, you can look forward to it on the PlayStation 2 Xbox and the PSP

89
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,520
Also on those systems. Well, not the PSP

90
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:51,480
But you're gonna be getting spy hunter know where to run which a kind of a classic remake of the old

91
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,880
you know arcade shooter series also which is supposed to be coming out as a movie later

92
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,880
on.

93
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,160
For your 360 fan so Test Drive Unlimited is coming out as well as Xbox Live Arcade Unplugged

94
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,520
Volume 1 will be also hitting the streets.

95
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:13,320
Loco Roco is coming out on the PSP this week and Yakuza on the Playstation 2 is going to

96
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,400
be coming out this week and those are going to be the big ones for this week.

97
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,720
And also of course next week the big thing is probably going to be Lego Star Wars 2 as

98
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:27,680
well as Rule of Rose, which I hopefully look forward to talking about soon.

99
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,200
And yeah, that's pretty much it.

100
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,160
Did you have news about price drops too?

101
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,520
Ah yes, I did.

102
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,440
Lots of fun stuff getting price drops.

103
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:50,960
The D3 announced this week that Naruto, the Gameboy Advance game Ninja Council, is going

104
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,360
to be added to the player choice lineup as well as-

105
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,320
And they will pay you $5 to play their game!

106
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,320
Hey!

107
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,320
That game wasn't that bad.

108
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,320
I'm just teasing.

109
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,320
I'm teasing.

110
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,320
I don't think.

111
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,320
I mean, sheesh.

112
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:12,760
were getting added to that as well as the GameCube version, Naruto, I want to say, no

113
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:18,080
it wasn't Ultimate Ninja, whatever, the GameCube one, I don't play the GameCube that much anymore.

114
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:24,200
But if you have like a 360 and you may not have joined up in Vanadil yet, Final Fantasy

115
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:29,240
11 is going to be dropped to $29.99, which is pretty awesome.

116
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,640
Come to the dark side.

117
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,640
And then if you have...

118
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:39,000
And if you really can't wait for some FIFA action, FIFA World Cup 06 for the 360 is dropped

119
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,280
down to $39.99 as well, FIFA 07 of course coming out in October, so not too far off,

120
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,960
but you still got to wait.

121
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,640
Now Dark Sakura does have the night off because of her anniversary and that doesn't mean though

122
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,480
that we're going to neglect our fans over in the UK, we're going to show you a little

123
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,240
love with some of the release dates that you guys are getting in the very near future.

124
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,380
Dead Rising is coming out on the 8th finally for you guys, with some better box art I think

125
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,380
than what we got here.

126
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,380
See the new box art?

127
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,380
It's slightly better, yeah.

128
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,380
It's kinda hot, I like it.

129
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,560
So, maybe it was worth the wait, okay, probably not.

130
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,760
The only thing I don't like about the box art, no representation for the Servbot head.

131
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,760
That's true, that's true.

132
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,980
But the game is pretty hot, so you guys in Europe have been waiting long enough for it,

133
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,420
so you finally get it on the 8th.

134
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,620
Enchanted Arms is also coming out for you guys on the 8th.

135
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,860
Also coming out for you guys, Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins on the PSP.

136
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:35,040
I forgot that was also coming out this week here if you're a PC gamer you have two games coming out secret files a

137
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:42,360
Tunguska and warfront turning point looking ahead to the week of the 15th on the PC call of Juarez faces of war

138
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,360
Gtr2 broken sword the angel of death, but if you're a little bit more of a console gamer

139
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,560
you do have Yakuza and NASCAR o7 to look forward to on the PlayStation 2 and

140
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,260
Should be pointed out calendared right now for September 16th

141
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:02,040
Mikotov you like this UK finally getting Suikoden 5 I don't care about

142
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:08,300
them so wow you're polite yeah did you like Suikoden 5 is it a good game in the

143
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:13,900
series I think so but I helped write it so which means we have to make double

144
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:18,860
fun of it yay I wish we could get the original Japanese version instead

145
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,320
because the English version sucks.

146
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,320
Nobody heard you.

147
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,320
Just kidding.

148
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:31,860
Anywho, speaking of things that suck and happen to be from Konami.

149
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,860
Is it Bomberman?

150
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,860
No!

151
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,860
A Bomberman Zero?

152
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:45,640
Actually, Konami has licensed Frogger to be made into a little portable gaming device.

153
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,680
This device is going to be kind of like a tablet system.

154
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:54,660
It's going to feature 25 8-bit games, including Frogger, as well as some forgotten titles

155
00:09:54,660 --> 00:10:02,640
like Vitamania, Funny Fungi, Stuntman, and Daredevil, or Stuntman and Daredevil, that's

156
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,640
okay.

157
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,640
I haven't heard those.

158
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:14,880
Anyways, it's got a 2-inch backlit TFT LCD display screen as well as some fun little

159
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,360
white shell for it that's also lime green magenta and orange and we'll be able to be

160
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,360
hooked up to your TV kind of like a plug and play type of thing. It's supposed to retail

161
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:30,520
oh and by the way it does not come with the plug and play hookup kit that is another ten

162
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:38,680
dollars but the tablet itself will be $29.99. Okay, seriously Kami, I really love you guys.

163
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:47,960
I mean seriously, Castlevania, DDR, Contra, Silent Hill, Gods among games, even Suikoden

164
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,560
is not that bad, gods among games.

165
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,520
But seriously Konami, get over Frogger.

166
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,880
Let the damn frog drown and be done with it.

167
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,760
Oh by the way, put those resources towards something else, I beg of you, please.

168
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,400
That is what the device looks like by the way.

169
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,500
It looks like poop.

170
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,300
It looks like a cheap knockoff of the Game Boy Advance.

171
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,460
It looks like kind of like a Wonder Swan in a weird way.

172
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,460
I don't know, to me.

173
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,580
Maybe it's just the button layout kind of reminds me of Wonder Swan.

174
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,580
I don't know.

175
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,580
And you?

176
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,580
Perhaps I'm crazy.

177
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,580
You know who you can really blame for this?

178
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,580
Pelican.

179
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,580
Because they're the one putting it out.

180
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,580
Yay.

181
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,580
Fun, fun.

182
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,580
Hooray, hooray.

183
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:33,380
Okay, look, moving on to other games.

184
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,420
I'm trying to see if there's any feedback in our chat room.

185
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:41,560
I don't see a hole looks like they're gonna have bus to move on it Darcy. Well, that's Oh burger time burger time

186
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,820
Hey now, I'm a little I'm a little more satisfied. I dark Tetsuya says every effing Frogger game. He can't swim

187
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,820
He's a frog for crying out loud

188
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:54,060
Good point Jeremy Todd one says let the fog get run over by a semi already. That's our chat room

189
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,580
www.orangeonsready.com click on chat

190
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:02,700
Hmm interesting. I'm so excited about this port to the DS or at least I was when I first read about it

191
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:08,600
And then I was a little bit disappointed okay one of the most underlooked Super Nintendo games of all time that was so great was

192
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,340
Sim City on the Super Nintendo, and yes

193
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:14,840
I know it was a PC game to begin with and the PC game was awesome, too

194
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,220
But the Super Nintendo version kind of added

195
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:22,100
You know the cuteness factor to it that made the game very cool although my favorite version of this game will always be

196
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:29,060
The one that was on CD-ROM for Sim City that had the really cheesy news segments in full motion video that was inserted into the

197
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,740
mill of it I was the best thing ever well anyway SimCity is coming to the DS

198
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:37,620
SimCity is coming through Electronic Arts and it's featured in the latest

199
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:42,220
issue of Famicu magazine so I read that and I said fuck yes it's gonna be

200
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:47,780
SimCity on the DS except then I read this it's based on SimCity 3000 and then

201
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:51,140
I went no

202
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:58,180
cuz I hate SimCity 3000 like nothing will never be as good as the original

203
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:03,740
for me but if you like before it's really fun if you like SimCity 3000

204
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,620
then maybe you'll get a kick out of the SimCity DS it's got three main modes of

205
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:12,620
play build the city save the city and sister city sister city mode lets you

206
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,460
chat with other players and trade landmarks so that's kind of cool so

207
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:23,820
something to look forward to DS fans anyways one good thing for Nintendo is

208
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,020
is Tecmo is supporting the Wii's virtual console aggressively.

209
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:31,140
And what does this mean? Well it probably means that you're going to be able to play

210
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,940
such wonderful games like Tecmo Bowl and stuff like that.

211
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,580
They have not said exactly which games are going to be supported on there

212
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,900
but it is going to be coming with lots of stuff so

213
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:46,140
that's great. I like to see that they're supporting it and maybe we'll get some

214
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:50,940
Ninja Gaiden stuff as well.

215
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:56,940
Very cool. Now I'll go to a story about the Wii, talking about the Wiimote.

216
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:01,940
Basically what's going on, there could be some production issues going on right now.

217
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:05,940
Go Nintendo picked up a story that was going on about the Nintendo Wii,

218
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,940
and there's a quote here on what's going on with the Wii production.

219
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,940
Quote, the factory has received Wii controller's purchasing order in its sample,

220
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,940
but it's still stuck in testing phase.

221
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,940
From feedbacks of testers, currently the Wiimote and Nunchuck still have a lot of small issues.

222
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,940
small issues, such as the buttons not being sensitive, it's hard to press two buttons

223
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:29,260
together, and no response occasionally. Uh oh, could this be a bad sign for the Wii?

224
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,740
I don't know, the thing felt fine to me at E3. I don't know what this thing's talking

225
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,460
about, but whatever. Exactly, I mean, come on, they've already

226
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:39,700
produced some already. I don't see why, in all, it didn't seem that hard to play with

227
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,620
at E3. Yeah.

228
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,660
I mean, if this is in full production, unless they fucked up something in the production

229
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,380
line you know

230
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,380
I don't see why it wouldn't be

231
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,500
I don't believe it to be honest because I mean those things aren't that complex

232
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,780
it's a fucking controller mean

233
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:58,220
they built tons of controllers for a while now I it's not that different from

234
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:02,900
like button pushing why I I'm thinking it's a minor issue that's blowing up

235
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,900
into something major

236
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,780
so good I mean if you think about it they've been making console controllers

237
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,120
for a long time now

238
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,060
and that my drinks empty so they put out a problem that is a very big problem

239
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:17,060
but this is a much worse than Nintendo not being able to make new controllers

240
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,260
my drink is empty this is a problem that must be remedied immediately

241
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:24,060
anyways I don't think it's a big deal because if you think about it they've

242
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,060
been making console controllers for a long time

243
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,420
and they should be able to get it right so whatever

244
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,940
alright well we are going to go to the skype line right now because I notice

245
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,860
we're getting a call in right now on the skype line I definitely want to take this

246
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,460
call

247
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:40,180
Orange Launch Radio are you there? I am

248
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:45,020
sort of. Oh, is that Jamie? Yes it is. Hi Jamie, how are you?

249
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:48,260
I'm doing okay. It's been a very

250
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:52,500
busy day. Yeah? What kind of stuff have you been doing to celebrate your anniversary? Happy anniversary

251
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,020
by the way from all of us at Orange Launch Radio and our chat room and all that.

252
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,620
Thank you. Well, on Friday I came home and there were

253
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,060
roses waiting for me, which made me all happy.

254
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:06,660
You know, I am a girl. I like girl things sometimes. Right.

255
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,520
and we went out to eat at this place called Fats,

256
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,840
which was me actually after we ate, so.

257
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,560
But no, it's this place in Roseville

258
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,480
that's like a expensive Chinese place.

259
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,640
You know what, I'm looking in our chatroom right now,

260
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,660
orangeonshoot.com, and then the chatroom is going,

261
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,640
oh shit, it's Dark Sakura, get in the car, hide!

262
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,620
They've been doing snakes on a plane jokes all night long,

263
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,160
they know they're in trouble.

264
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,400
Actually, one of the people I met at Disneyland,

265
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,600
who was also somebody I've been watching on DeviantArt,

266
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,440
she worked at Disneyland until just recently

267
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,120
was going around putting those, uh, plushie snakes on different characters' heads.

268
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:46,760
It's funny, she did, like, snakes on a hatter, and did movie files of the Mad Hatter and Alice playing with snakes.

269
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,240
You know, it's been about, what, two weeks since you've been to Disneyland and you still haven't stopped talking about it?

270
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,400
I love Disneyland. No, I know, it's great. Hey, how was your gaming week? What kind of games have you been playing this week?

271
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,480
Actually, I just got done playing a game, the newest addition to the pinball collection.

272
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,200
Uh-oh, what'd you guys get? Star Trek The Next Generation pinball.

273
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,080
Dude, that's awesome! That's a great pinball table.

274
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:10,760
It is, and the thing about it, Dan got it for pretty much, you know, a steal, you know,

275
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:15,040
given that the machines go for, what, three, four thousand dollars? He's in the bathroom.

276
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:19,480
Yeah, don't take him to the bathroom. Don't take the phone to the bathroom, please.

277
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,280
No, but

278
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,080
we got it for a pretty good price, and it needs a lot of work to it, but it came with

279
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:31,240
like a bunch of extra ramps and stuff, and Dan's gonna put some work into it. I actually went ahead and played it, but we had the glass off.

280
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:36,240
Oh my God, pinball machines are loud when they have no glass on them, so we were cheating and hitting the targets.

281
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,240
That is a little bit of cheating. That's cool though.

282
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,240
We were like throwing the ball at the Delta Quadrant ramp and everything. It was really cool.

283
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,240
Did you play any console games at all?

284
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,240
I have enchanted arms. I haven't actually played it yet because I've been sort of busy with the whole anniversary thing.

285
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,240
And I played some Super Mario Brothers.

286
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,240
You need to play it before the next show because I want to know what you think of Makoto.

287
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,240
Okay, I will play it.

288
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,360
OK, I will play it.

289
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,200
There's a gay guy in it.

290
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:01,920
Great.

291
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,000
Yeah, it's interesting.

292
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,440
That's all I have to say.

293
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,080
You know, that makes my inner hag happy.

294
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,280
What, you've been playing Super Mario Brothers?

295
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,800
Like, the new Super Mario Brothers or the old one?

296
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,040
I got one for free.

297
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,920
Oh, cool.

298
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,520
Very cool.

299
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,880
I've been giving it some play.

300
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,520
Did you have any, like, news you wanted

301
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:21,120
to share with the listeners tonight since you're not here?

302
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,840
No.

303
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,080
OK, I did release dates for you, and we did mailbag.

304
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,160
OK, cool.

305
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,520
I actually, I've been conversing with a few of our listeners being, I've been sort of,

306
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,240
I looked into the box, I'd be honest, I thought that since you would check it for me, I was

307
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,100
like, oh, I'll handle that tonight.

308
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,920
It's all good.

309
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,640
Have fun with your weekend off and all that fun stuff.

310
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,440
I will be there next weekend with a vengeance.

311
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,000
199, can you believe it?

312
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,920
We're almost at episode 200, it's crazy.

313
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,040
Oh wow, that's next week, isn't it?

314
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,040
I know.

315
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,600
Well no, 199 is next week, and then 200.

316
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,120
That's the same, 199 is next week.

317
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:01,120
Craziness. Anything else you want to share with the listeners, DarkSakura?

318
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,120
Yeah, give me dollars.

319
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,120
Alright.

320
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,120
Put it in the DarkSakura's next anniversary fund.

321
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,120
Alright, you can send those dollars to mailbag at orangehonestradio.com.

322
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,120
Sound good?

323
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,120
Virtual dollars.

324
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,120
Alright. Yeah, you can draw pictures of dollars. That'd be awesome.

325
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,120
Okay. Yeah, okay. New Photoshop contest. Best dollar wins.

326
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:25,120
Actually, I think they're doing a Photoshop contest right now on orangehonestradio.com of best orange honest radio fake news.

327
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,280
It's pretty funny. I've been looking at that. It was pretty hilarious. I like the first one. Yeah, it's pretty awesome

328
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,840
It's all done like the old death cake logo. It's great

329
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:41,220
All right, I guess that's it for now Dark Sakura. We'll see you next week. Yep. Definitely. All right. Take care

330
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,640
Thanks for calling in. The other people will hear me. All right, that works

331
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,580
By the way, oh, I have to say wait. We've been drinking tonight

332
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:54,520
Do you condone this action? I fully do. I was drinking the other night. Awesome

333
00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:00,400
I'm gonna be drinking tonight. All right, sounds good. Have fun, but not too much. And by the way, I need to talk to you later.

334
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,080
Okay, you know where to find me.

335
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,720
Okay, bye.

336
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,640
I like those, you know,

337
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,200
totally personal messages in the middle of the show. No, that's fine. It was funny.

338
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:21,880
Nellie was talking about how she wanted to bring you Long Island iced tea because the last, or she remembered that one time that you're at the old

339
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:27,120
apartment and you were trying to run up the wall because you have Long Island I

340
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:34,880
see yeah I remember that it was a little bit crazy all right anyways some

341
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,680
interesting stuff I'm speaking about kind of running and flailing and stuff

342
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:44,120
like that they're looking for testers for the Wii and you're gonna be doing a

343
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:49,400
lot of flailing apparently there's some article posted on MTV news and I'm sure

344
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:57,240
they're the great source of gaming news. But anyways, saying that they're going into more

345
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,940
of the process of creating and testing the games, and some of the gestures for example

346
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:07,800
for Marvel Ultimate Alliance, that they brought down, you're actually doing a lot of flinging

347
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:12,540
about in order to perform some of the moves, because only the buttons they're using for

348
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:17,040
like A to jump and stuff like that, but still you gotta do a lot of gestures in order to

349
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:22,800
actually be doing attacks and whatnot. And that includes a lot of arm flailing and stuff

350
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,840
like that. Which should be interesting because I can't imagine playing that four player,

351
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,660
staying next to your buddy or whatever and swinging your arms around. But the game initially

352
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:37,840
started out with like apparently 20 gestures, but they simplified it down to five. So players

353
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:43,660
are going to be constantly shooting, webbing, and tossing Captain America shields and stuff

354
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:47,580
like that so, pretty interesting.

355
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:54,180
Alright, moving on, now the Wii is all the rage right now and folks can't wait to get

356
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,060
their hands on that and I'm sure a lot of folks will be wanting to play test it just

357
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:01,040
to be able to say they played it early, but one thing nobody seems to want to play is

358
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:07,020
the Game Boy Micro, at least in the UK, G-A-M-E or game I suppose, I'm not sure if it's an

359
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:12,100
acronym for something but I guess you could just call it game for short, a UK retailer

360
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,520
has sent the Game Boy Micros to the bargain bin.

361
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:22,060
They used to be 69 pounds, now they're running for just 39 pounds, ouch.

362
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:26,060
So if this is something that you've had your eye on but didn't want to get just yet, now

363
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:29,620
might be a good time because they've come way down in price.

364
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,380
So in the UK bargain bins anyway.

365
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:37,120
By the way, 39 pounds is still about 75 US dollars, may not be worth it to import still

366
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,420
because I think they're running a little cheaper than that here in America.

367
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:47,620
Well, you know, people may not be, you know, lining up for the Game Boy Micro, but they

368
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:53,740
are lining up for the black DS Lite in Japan, and apparently they haven't really released

369
00:22:53,740 --> 00:23:00,700
any numbers yet, but there's lines blocks long, so it should be interesting, probably

370
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:06,980
another sellout for the DS Lite, and I know that there's new colors coming to Japan, actually

371
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,620
pretty much all the regions here pretty soon.

372
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:13,220
I know that weíre getting here in the US the black and pink DS lights which are going

373
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:17,100
to be coming out I think on the 20th and then I know in the UK theyíre getting the pink

374
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:22,340
one as well so it should be interesting with lots of different colors people seeing them

375
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,220
eat up that stuff.

376
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:27,180
Itís just another color.

377
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,180
I donít understand why people are going nuts over this.

378
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,340
No, I already have them pre-ordered my black DS light.

379
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:34,060
Of course then again Iím going to get the pink one I think unless I have a change of

380
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:37,380
heart but thatís just because I knew if I bought a white one they would come out with

381
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:41,340
new color so I waited no no that's not what you're supposed to do you're

382
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:45,580
supposed to go to eevee or GameStop buy the system when it comes out in the

383
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:49,980
color you don't want get the replacement plan then when the color does come out

384
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:54,980
that you want put down the money for the reservation take your old system that

385
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:59,300
you didn't like back say didn't work then get your new color and then you

386
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,640
still got money for your next replacement plan for the next color you

387
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,240
want like I have I'm gonna get a blue and when it comes out or maybe I don't

388
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,560
know what if those colors don't come out you're gonna be screwed off black that's

389
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:16,080
better than the white one or just pick a color and stick with it all right we're

390
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,080
gonna go to another segment now and it's a segment that's returning because it

401
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,120
this game, correct? Correct. Now, the prize we were going to give away tonight was another

402
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,400
space on our MySpace Top 8, but gee, you already seem to have that. So we'll have to come up

403
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,160
with something more creative for you, DMM, if you win tonight. Alright, and you know

404
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:20,060
what? What? Since we're talking about Game Boy Micros, if the host beats me, I'll give

405
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:27,040
them mine. Oh, snap! Something on the line tonight. Is that really a prize, though? Because

406
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,480
Because it's a Game Boy Micro.

407
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,480
Alright.

408
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,480
You know what?

409
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,480
What?

410
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,480
It's you, I'll keep it.

411
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,480
Alright.

412
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,480
Well then, you lose.

413
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,760
The gauntlet has been thrown then, this is gonna be interesting tonight, okay, so some

414
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,760
actual stuff.

415
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,480
Okay, DMN, this is what we'll do.

416
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:47,200
We will give you the same prize we gave the last guy, and you will get to help us with

417
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,960
our Power Preview debuts, meaning you'll be the first in the world to know about some

418
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,240
of these new tracks whenever we get to do them.

419
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,240
Okay.

420
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,240
Which hopefully should be soon.

421
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,240
All right, so anyway, who do you want to challenge tonight and beat the host?

422
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:03,240
Oh, first off, I don't even know if I need to ask because you work for Nintendo,

423
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,240
but how would you say your knowledge of 8-bit video game music is?

424
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,240
It's pretty decent.

425
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,240
Pretty decent? All right, well, we'll see what happens.

426
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,240
He works for Nintendo?

427
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,240
Yeah, he does. You didn't know that?

428
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,240
No, I didn't.

429
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,240
It's because I came in late. Who do I have to choose from?

430
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,240
All right, here's what you do. First, I have to boot you from the chat room

431
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,240
because you cannot have their help tonight in this game, sorry.

432
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,240
You can challenge either, and don't rejoin yet,

433
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:31,000
You can challenge either Miklotov or Loki tonight.

434
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,600
Let's do it, Loki.

435
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:37,200
Alright, Loki is being challenged, so you know what that means, Loki?

436
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,200
Get out!

437
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,200
God dammit.

438
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,760
Alright, while Loki is heading to the isolation room, I'm going to explain how Beat the Host

439
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,760
works.

440
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:50,040
We're going to play a clip that has ten, tonight it's old school 8-bit Nintendo songs streamed

441
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,040
together in it.

442
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:56,300
And at the very end of the clip you will have 30 seconds to name back as many of these 8-bit

443
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,660
songs as you can.

444
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,660
Sound good?

445
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,660
Sounds like a plan.

446
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:03,280
So you can write them down as you go, whatever you want to do, but you only get 30 seconds

447
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,280
to name them back.

448
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,280
Okay?

449
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,280
All right.

450
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,280
All right.

451
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,280
Now Chat Room, you guys can play along.

452
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,040
Omegletov, are you hurt that nobody ever picks you for this game?

453
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,640
Well, they're stupid for not picking me because I'm really bad at this stuff.

454
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,800
It's like an automatic win.

455
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:20,240
Well, but you basically shat on the prize that DMN was going to give you, so I would

456
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:25,240
No! You know what? I could have given him, I don't know, toenail clippings and it would have been just as good.

457
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:29,240
You know what? If they came with a certificate of authenticity, I'll take them.

458
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,240
Ew!

459
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,240
That's kind of gross, but you're on.

460
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,240
You might be able to get something like that from a DDR freak.

461
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,240
Alright.

462
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,240
Jesus.

463
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,240
Here we go.

464
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,240
Here it is. You ready, DMN?

465
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,240
I'm ready.

466
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:49,240

467
00:28:42,240 --> 00:29:03,500

473
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,940

474
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:50,500

481
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:52,140
host

482
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:32,460
Hey, shut up, we can hear you!

483
00:31:45,140 --> 00:32:01,460
Alright, Loki, you have 30 seconds to name them back.

484
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,060
On your mark, get set, go!

485
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:09,740
Friday the 13th, Tetris, yes, yes, Excitebike, yes, Bionic Commando, yes, Super Mario 2,

486
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:13,100
yes, uhh, I wanna say Super C?

487
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,100
No.

488
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,100
Contra?

489
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:22,060
Damn it. Um, fuck. I don't know. That's all I got. That's it. I'm sure you got 15. It's just randomly named games

490
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:29,180
Shit I don't I can't think of anything then to be honest

491
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:33,580
There's one I recognize but I can't remember it was all right time is up

492
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:38,300
Let's tally it up Loki. You got five. That's a really good score

493
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:44,260
And if DMN had been telling the truth about not getting any you would have beat him, but unfortunately DMN got six

494
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:51,260
6! The host has been beaten!

495
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:17,460
Or are you just going to beat up DMN because you don't like him?

496
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:20,900
No, I don't hate him at all. I just want a free Wii.

497
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:24,580
DMN, I have to know, did you have outside help? Because I heard you talking to somebody there.

498
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:27,940
I had somebody remembering my

499
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:31,660
guesses, but in all honesty, he did not give me any single answer.

500
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:35,300
Alright, alright, fine, fair enough. Alright, I'm sure you guys want to know

501
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,780
what the correct answers were.

502
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,420
Chatroom did a really good job though, I think they got them all, but here they are for you

503
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,420
guys listening on the podcast that were playing along.

504
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,420
Did you beat the host tonight? Let's find out.

505
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,420
Adventures of Lolo!

506
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,420
Friday the 13th!

507
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:57,420
One of my favorite sleeper hits. I don't care if that game got negative reviews, it's awesome.

508
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,420
Tetris!

509
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,420
That was an easy one.

510
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,420
River City Ransom!

511
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,420
God damn it.

512
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,420
This is the one I thought was Contra.

513
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,420
Oh, I would have thought it was the one coming up.

514
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,420
I thought it was some sort of freaking Konami game.

515
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,420
Excitebike!

516
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:23,420
And that's like the only music in all of Excitebike is right there.

517
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,420
Bionic Commando!

518
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,420
I played this game so much that it was...

519
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:30,420
That's the one that I completely forgot to say.

520
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,420
I would have thought you'd know that one, Loki.

521
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,420
I did! I put it that way.

522
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,420
He got it, I didn't.

523
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,420
Oh, sorry, my bad.

524
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:39,940
Audius, of course.

525
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:46,300
Dragon Warrior.

526
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,380
I don't think either of you guys got this one. Double Dragon.

527
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,660
God, I used to play that game so much.

528
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:54,820
And lastly, you guys both got Super Mario Bros. 2.

529
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:57,860
I'm turning in my resignation in Nintendo. That was pitiful.

530
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:05,260
Oh no, you did fine. It's hard! Don't do that before you give me the free Wii that I'm going to beat you up for.

531
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:08,800
no actually i'm thinking later on at some point

532
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,160
during uh... the show we're gonna have like a uh... take-home

533
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,120
beat the host type thing that the good that you guys will have like a week

534
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,720
to send in the correct answers will give away something big like around

535
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,240
christmas night but they're gonna be really fucking hard like really fucking

536
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,960
obscure games

537
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,880
so we'll see

538
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,520
i didn't any proud of beating the host tonight

539
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:37,240
I am seeing as like I jumped in the show about oh 20 minutes ago. Yeah. Hey, it works at listening live

540
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:41,880
Any time it ends up working out anything else you want to share with our listeners before I hang up on you. Um

541
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:49,060
Happy anniversary Jamie, and I'll see whoever's challenging me to Tetris in about 30 seconds

542
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:52,920
All right, have fun with the chat room in Tetris. All right, take care later. Later

543
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:58,660
That was fun. Mm-hmm. I will honor the chat rooms request next time we do beat the host

544
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:04,820
I'm we will do something maybe Sega games. I know some folks want to challenge their Sega knowledge, especially against Jamie because

545
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,340
that girl scary with her Sega knowledge and

546
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:12,540
Maybe some other you know more current titles, so that'll probably last time we do 8-bit Nintendo for a little while

547
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:17,620
So we'll see you need to do an all Mega Man one because there's so many different robot bosses

548
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,980
And they all sound the same that might be one for the future

549
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:24,660
We'll see are you saying that you would be willing if you can just name out guesses

550
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,660
You can just go through all the Mega Man games

551
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:30,380
Alright. Well maybe you'd have to actually like

552
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:34,180
only guess one per song like have a like a sort of like a

553
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:38,900
a list that you have to fill out. Alright let's get back into tonight's gaming

554
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,860
news and

555
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:43,000
speaking of music we did a lot of music there by the way I hope you guys enjoyed

556
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,220
that segment if you didn't

557
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:48,560
too bad. No, we always appreciate your feedback mailbag at orangeontraday.com

558
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:53,780
Some new tracks were announced in the latest electronic gaming monthly

559
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:56,920
or I guess they're called EGM for short now

560
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,920
because I guess it's the cool thing to go by an acronym

561
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,860
some new songs were announced for Guitar Hero 2

562
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:07,760
Nirvana with Heart Shaped Box, Primus with John the Fisherman

563
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,980
Stone Temple Pilots with Trippin' on a Hole in a Paper Heart

564
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:16,120
Anthrax with Mout House, Motley Crue with Shout at the Devil

565
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,260
The Police with Message in a Bottle

566
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:23,260
The Pretenders with Tattooed Love Boys and get this Spinal Tap

567
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:28,540
with tonight I'm gonna rock you tonight. That is so awesome that they got spinal

568
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,460
tap in the game.

569
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:33,220
Where's Queen? There was Black Hole Sun.

570
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:37,540
You know, rumor is Black Hole Sun is there. There's some

571
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:41,300
really weird rumor going around on the official Guitar Hero forums that

572
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:41,900
involves

573
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:45,180
like PlayStation 3 versions of the game and all this crazy shit.

574
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:49,100
So I don't know. We'll see. I don't want to have to like this stupid game.

575
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,660
Why do you hate Guitar Hero so much?

576
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,660
It's not fun!

577
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,660
You know what?

578
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,240
I didn't have a good time with it every time I tried it.

579
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,580
I'm with you, Shane.

580
00:37:55,580 --> 00:38:02,620
I'm like about this close to selling back my Guitar Hero and Guitar Hero controller.

581
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:06,820
But I'm almost like seeing, okay maybe I should wait until this comes out.

582
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,820
I don't know.

583
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:11,280
Because I figure I'm going to have to buy another one anyways for the 360 if it comes

584
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,700
out so I might as well.

585
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,980
I don't know.

586
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:18,760
just now they're getting what rush is pretty cool and getting stone temple

587
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:24,120
pilots makes me happy and I we're running low on liquor so I'm running out

588
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:30,880
boys and girls okie-dokie bye hey Mike let's talk about mashed potatoes again

589
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,200
we can't talk about us yes dang it we have to talk about best buy and talk

590
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:40,080
about bully and take about stupid people having too much time on their hands so

591
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:45,480
So anyways, there's some oddly named protest group called the Pizzaholics that have staged

592
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:58,480
a protest at a game, or at a Best Buy outside of New York City. And apparently, it's really

593
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,680
weird. Apparently they're just protesting the game, you know, saying that Rockstar is

594
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:08,600
worse than terrorists, and whatever. You know, I'm really tired of people, you know, protesting

595
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:15,480
in a game that they don't even know what the premise of the game is, or just how you actually

596
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:20,200
play the game and whether it actually rewards bullying, because to be honest, from what

597
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,520
I've seen in the game, it doesn't look like you are the bully, it's kind of like you're

598
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,640
being bullied, you know, that type of thing.

599
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:30,880
I think it was something like you start out being bullied and then you become the bully

600
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,880
later on.

601
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,040
It doesn't matter because all they're protesting is that little image in the corner with the

602
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,440
are in the star there for rockstar

603
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,600
I'm just tired of people protesting crab... protest something else how about

604
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:46,080
high gas prices or something I don't know

605
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:50,000
but whatever they're protesting bully for now until the next Grand Theft Auto game

606
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,800
High gas prices doesn't corrupt your kids though

607
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,280
so yeah I don't know

608
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,040
should be good

609
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:04,320
hi sorry I was just kidding I brought you back more watermelon stuff

610
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,320
What did you bring me back?

611
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,460
Fuck, you didn't want more watermelon stuff, huh?

612
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,460
I'm sorry.

613
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,460
Whatever, I'm fine.

614
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,460
Are you gonna drink it?

615
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,220
I don't want it to go to waste, there's starving children throughout the world who might want

616
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,220
that drink.

617
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:16,220
Well, I'm not sure how much more I really want to drink.

618
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,220
Do you want to try it?

619
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,220
Do you want the screwdriver?

620
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,220
No, I do not want the screwdriver.

621
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,220
I feel bad.

622
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,220
I will drink the watermelon stuff.

623
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:26,480
It's just, that cup that you have it in was I think originally a candy dish, and it is

624
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,480
like-

625
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,480
It's been washed-

626
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,480
I don't know how many times-

627
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,180
I know it's been washed, but it's an oversized mug.

628
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,380
It's like fucking huge, is what it is.

629
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,700

00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,960
thing you know kind of weird it's so

639
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,860
funny props to those guys who had the

640
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,200
balls go down there and do that though

641
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,900
props to you guys bully is no longer

642
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,700
going to be called bully in Europe and

643
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,540
This is according to Eurogamer.

644
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:08,140
It's going to go to stores under the title Canis Canem Edit,

645
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,980
which is Latin for dog eat dog.

646
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:14,180
No reason said why they're going to change the title,

647
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,700
but maybe because Rockstar is a little bit afraid

648
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,820
of all the controversy.

649
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,660
That might be a really good thing to do here

650
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,600
is just kind of swap the name around,

651
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,460
and then people will go, I had no idea

652
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,180
what you were talking about.

653
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:28,140
You know, Rockstar is kind of pussying out, I think.

654
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,220
Yeah, I agree.

655
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,140
I don't think they will change it here in America.

656
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:34,860
and I don't think that may be the reason they changed it in Europe.

657
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:38,000
Maybe, you know, they do name changes all the time with games in Europe for weird

658
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,740
reasons, it's not a big deal.

659
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:43,260
It is a pretty dumb name for the game. Yeah, I don't like that game either.

660
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:47,060
Anyways, there's some interesting news about Resident Evil for the Wii

661
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:52,220
and it's actually coming from Tara Platt, who is the voice actress for Jill Valentine,

662
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:55,820
and she confirmed that the game will feature zombies,

663
00:41:55,820 --> 00:42:00,140
or zombie-like enemies, and plant creatures, as well as a wide variety of

664
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:06,340
of weaponry. The fact that Mrs. Platt was aware of the weapons in the game infers that

665
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:11,820
she's voicing a playable character and not just doing a cameo. It says Jill being the

666
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:17,820
main character increases the likelihood of seeing Carlos and Barry turn up as well. That

667
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:21,300
would be kind of interesting, maybe they're remaking the first one or something? I don't

668
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:28,800
know. But hopefully it's not a gun survivor game, because those kind of suck.

669
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,840
Are you looking forward to Resident Evil on the Wii?

670
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,160
I guess.

671
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:43,140
I found something else funny because apparently she sent them an email, I think this is coming

672
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:49,840
from Kotaku here, I sent them an email about saying that she's not allowed to verify information

673
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:55,040
about Biohazard 5 or Resident Evil 5 in Japan or in the Wii game.

674
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,680
That's kind of funny.

675
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:01,520
It's like, oops, I slipped and then I take it all back.

676
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:08,760
Alright, I have a quick story for you guys here regarding, also on the Wii, the Legend

677
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,800
of Zelda.

678
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,760
In a tiny little blip that IGN wrote earlier this week, they dropped an interesting little

679
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,760
tidbit.

680
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:21,000
Twilight Princess will not only be bigger, a horse ride from one side of Hyrule to the

681
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,880
next is rumored to take 45 real minutes to get from one side of the world to the other

682
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:31,240
on horse. Of course, that's nothing compared to a chocobo ride around Final Fantasy XI,

683
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,120
but... That's very true.

684
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:37,760
MMOs are supposed to be big, though. That's still pretty impressive, you've got to admit.

685
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,600
You gotta imagine how long it's going to take you to walk, then, from the other side.

686
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,360
Okay, but... Horse will significantly increase the speed.

687
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:46,080
I'm thinking, obviously, at some point you'll be able to play an ocarina and be able to

688
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:49,400
warp around. Why do you do that with an ocarina?

689
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,320
Because you have to, it's Zelda. No, they don't always have ocarinas.

690
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:55,360
They could have something else, a flute, something. You know there's going to be a tornado that

691
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,960
wish you away because they're not going to expect people to actually use 45 minutes to

692
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:04,120
run from one side unless they're exploring or do they well they'd be stupid if they did

693
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:09,240
they they made you do that crap in um um what's that game wind waker we had to go and find

694
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:15,360
the triforce pieces and that was hours upon hours of pain wind waker was a little bit

695
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:22,680
lame compared to the other zeldas and uh uh that other god-awful 64 one uh majora's mask

696
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,680
Don't even get me started.

697
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,480
You know, to be honest, I kind of liked Wind Waker.

698
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,480
It's okay!

699
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:33,440
I don't know, I would have rather seen that like, you know, kind of, I guess, not Link's

700
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:41,000
Awakening but, I don't know, one of the older Zelda's done kind of the same style as Wind

701
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Waker, but actually be, you know, for the GameCube and fully 3D and not, you know, this,

702
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,000
you know, for the DS with Wind Waker graphics type of crap, so anyways, anyways, speaking

703
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,120
of stuff that's kind of crappy. Live ads coming to video games. Yes, that's right. EA has

704
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:03,060
signed a deal with two ad companies that will stream live advertisement into the brand new

705
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:09,360
Need for Speed Carbon and of course the upcoming PC and probably next gen game Battlefield

706
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:16,800
2142. It's quite interesting that they're doing this. I mean, they've also kind of run

707
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:22,000
into a lot of controversy with, you know, gathering information about their users and

708
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,600
whatnot for god knows what reasons.

709
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:28,440
Maybe now they're going to be gathering information about their users to advertise to them.

710
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,440
I don't know.

711
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,200
I think if I pay for a game, then why the fuck do I gotta see advertisements in the

712
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,200
game as well?

713
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:38,760
I mean, it's gonna be kind of stupid when I'm playing around Battlefield 2142 and all

714
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,560
of a sudden there's a Toyota Yaris, you know, fucking billboard.

715
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,600
You know, I gotta be honest though, I think the real ads to some extent are gonna be better

716
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:51,480
to look at them fake ads. I mean, you know, why not? You have fake ads in games as it

717
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,800
is. In terms of... Some of them are funny. Like, especially, I think about You Don't

718
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,280
Know Jack. Like, that game was so awesome. Listen, okay, the fake ads like in Grand Theft

719
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:05,360
Auto are awesome. I mean, come on, vivisection. It's hilarious. And ammunition. I don't know.

720
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:09,260
Uh, a chatroom is saying that, um, Funny Dale says Orange Launch Radio needs to have ads

721
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:15,040
in Saints Row. Oh, that'd be cool. So what do you think? You think this is the end of

722
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,060
video games as we know it or what? Well it's not the end because you know I can ignore

723
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:21,460
them just as easily as I ignore everything else. At least they're not having like the

724
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:27,340
bird king king coming out and fucking you know. That would be awesome. I still think

725
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:30,860
though they should have made him a playable character in fight night round 3 because that

726
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:33,380
would have been fucking. I would have bought the game. I would have bought fight night

727
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:37,380
round 3 just for that too. Just for that. So I don't know. Just put the Muppets into

728
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:41,800
the fight night engine that would be awesome. I mean I gotta say rumble roses ok true that

729
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:46,860
game was kind of shitty but it was hilarious watching I mean getting to

730
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:50,600
play the women beating up on each other was so funny because like you know I was

731
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:54,680
able to give running commentary on the game and I was just going like ow you

732
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,800
just got kicked in the vagina ow you just got kicked in the vagina and it was

733
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:02,400
really funny wasn't it Mikal Tov no cuz I had to work on the game and I don't

734
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,960
find anything about that game funny anymore cuz it's obnoxious can you tell

735
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:09,320

736
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:16,040
act zero rumble roses xx i don't really have my hands cut off um no i just worked on text

737
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:22,440

738
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:32,520
um if it ended on five that wouldn't be terrible but all right look anything else you want to say

739
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:37,640
on this topic loki you know i gotta play through that damn game to get the achievements all right

744
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:04,780
Let's go to the phones and take a call. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

745
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:08,780
Hi Ravenstaufen, what's on your mind buddy?

746
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:12,780
The PSP thing and the DS.

747
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:16,780
You speak on it very briefly and you said, what is wrong with port?

748
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:20,780
I enjoy Grand Theft Auto. I enjoy

749
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:24,780
Super Mario Kart.

750
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:28,780
There's no need for a PSP vs. DS

751
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:32,780
War. Can't we all just get along?

752
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:35,780
saying. Everyone should just get along.

753
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:41,580
Okay, where do you think the PSP's strengths are and what do you think the DS's strengths are?

754
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:47,280
Well, I think the PSP's strengths are is in the video games and video games and video.

755
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,680
That's where the strength is.

756
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,580
Okay.

757
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:58,180
And it really does well with that. And the DS is, you know, DS is good for like,

758
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:04,340
and that's what the Wii is going to be like. It's going to be like touch screen.

759
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:06,580
I mean not touch screen.

760
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:09,540
A different way of interacting with the game.

761
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:10,560
Yeah.

762
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,980
Well who knows there are rumors that the DS could be used as a controller on the

763
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:16,860
Wii, much like you could use a Game Boy Advance on the GameCube with that

764
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:18,260
special little hookup.

765
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:21,940
So maybe there will be touch screen Wii games in the future, who knows?

766
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:28,020
Whereas the PSP, you can only use as your rear view mirror on the PlayStation 3.

767
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:29,540
That was funny, though.

768
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:33,900
No, in all seriousness, that is a pretty cool feature. Expensive, but good.

769
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:39,420
I mean, I think it's going to be a lot. Wouldn't you think, if the PSP didn't come along, that

770
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:44,440
that will be showing, that there will be like, ports of the Nintendo 64 games a lot?

771
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,860
A lot more...

772
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:50,780
Oh, run that by me again? Because you're kind of, you're kind of cutting out a little bit.

773
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:52,780
Oh. Okay.

774
00:49:52,780 --> 00:50:00,280
It's like, if the PSP didn't come along, the Nintendo 64, of course, would be on the Nintendo DS, on the Nintendo DS.

775
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:06,040
Right, that's kind of what a Nintendo DS feels like to me, is a Nintendo 64 with touch-screen graphics.

776
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:12,980
Yeah, but if the PSP didn't come along, that would all be, it would be like...

777
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:15,040
Okay.

778
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:18,440
And I thank the PSP for that and for its innovation.

779
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:22,320
Okay, I gotcha. Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners?

780
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,960
My internet sucks tonight, Sky.

781
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,920
That's why I'm calling on my cell phone.

782
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:26,640
All right.

783
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:27,680
Oh, it's a cell phone.

784
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,840
That answers a lot, because it's a little bit fuzzy.

785
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:30,720
But that's all right.

786
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,440
We appreciate the phone call, nevertheless.

787
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,520
All right, thank you, Sky.

788
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,240
Have a good week, my friend.

789
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:36,800
You too, Sky.

790
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,560
Until next time.

791
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,880

00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:45,400
Whoa, shit.

794
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,940
Hi, you're on Orange Honnash Radio.

795
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:47,640
Who's this?

796
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,600
Legend of Saku.

797
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:49,600
Hello, my friend.

798
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,360
What's on your mind, buddy?

799
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:57,540
Basically, why is everyone getting and you know their panties in a bunch about bullying especially groups

800
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:01,800
I think they know a lot about the game yet. They're protesting, you know

801
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:07,300
Misinformation because it's teaching the youth of America how to smoke crack and worship Satan

802
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:13,360
Actually bullies teaching them about the the right thing to do fighting back. Well now wait a minute

803
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:17,900
That's a thing. It's a pretty that you debatable. Look every family can you get put? Yeah

804
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:21,460
Yeah, I mean, you get pumped around, you fight back.

805
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:24,720
My parents didn't choose to raise me that way, they didn't choose to raise me to fight

806
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:25,720
back.

807
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,800
Oh, did they raise you to use your words?

808
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:31,600
No, they raised me to go run and tell the principal and then sue him.

809
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:32,600
Wow.

810
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,680
No, I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.

811
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,760
But something along those lines, you don't fight violence with violence.

812
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:38,760
Not in my household.

813
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:43,400
I sort of suspect that the peace of colleagues are being manipulated by, you know, a he who

814
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,400
cannot be named.

815
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,400
All right.

816
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:50,280
Okay, well needless to say it's up to a parent how they want to raise their kids or whatever fine

817
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:56,280
And it was and it should also be up to a parent how they want or what games they want their sorry

818
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:59,880
I've been drinking a little bit. It's also up to a parent too, man. That's fine

819
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:04,600
Uh, yeah, you're slurring too a little bit. Um, it's up to yeah, I tried hours ago. Shut up

820
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,000
I'm trying to think uh, it's also up to a parent

821
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,480
how

822
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:13,320
God damn it. They are it's up to a parent what games they want their kids to play, right?

823
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:26,320
Yeah, that's true. They ultimately control what the kid actually plays, and that's where all the responsibility falls, not the government.

824
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:37,320
Not the right of the government to tell us how to live our lives, to an extent. Obviously, murder, stealing, and all that other stuff have to be regulated.

825
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:42,520
But okay, well now wait a minute now here. Here's another question for you. What about freedom of speech these guys?

826
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,380
Yeah, right these guys have a right well

827
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:48,800
I'm defending these guys a little bit just be devil's advocate these guys have a right to protest

828
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:52,480
Just as we have the right to get on internet radio and calm stupid heads

829
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:57,280
Yeah, I respect that right, but I also have the right to criticize not you know

830
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:02,940
I'm trying to be very constructive in that I'm pointing out their fallacies like a fact that they're saying that the FCC

831
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:07,660
see regulates you know you know regulates the the whole content rating

832
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:12,660
which actually the ESRB does and the fact that they're saying that rock stars

833
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:18,860
a bunch of terrorists that just blown out of proportion okay I can agree with

834
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:22,500
that what could these guys do better if they will get their point across

835
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:27,220
basically they need to play the game and then criticize you don't criticize

836
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:31,260
something that you don't know or haven't seen or have an experience and that's

837
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:34,700
That's what people, you know, it's been done already in the past.

838
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:40,460
People have jumped the gun too quickly without knowing the whole side of the story and they

839
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:41,860
just made up their mind already.

840
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:44,980
Yeah, you know what guys, Halo 3 fucking sucks.

841
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:49,180
I hate to tell you, but it's going to be the biggest letdown of the year.

842
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:55,100
It's a horrible game, live is so buggy you guys, you won't even believe.

843
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:59,860
Basically it's just, you know, those people who make up their mind without hearing the

844
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:00,860
other side of the story.

845
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:06,620
they're fools. They're just literally fools. They're not that smart to actually, you know,

846
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:10,220
they don't have the guts to actually experience, you know, the other side of the story and

847
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:14,860
then make them, you know, make up their mind and what they want to, you know, stand for.

848
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:18,460
Alright, any other words you have for our listeners tonight?

849
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:21,860
That was pretty much it and just, you know, don't drink in 2DX.

850
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:24,820
Okay, I won't. Bye.

851
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:26,820
Alright man

852
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,400
Don't drink in 2dx, okay

853
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:35,760
It's chat rooms yelling at me over that halo 3 comment

854
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,580
I was kidding you guys it was it was it was a joke in a way

855
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:42,100
It was a bad joke, but it was a joke if that makes any sense at all

856
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:47,700
We'll take one more call if anybody actually wants to call us area code 9 1 6 2 2 6 90 67

857
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:49,300
Remember kids that may be a toll call

858
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:52,900
We are too cheap to get an 800 number or at least Skype doesn't offer him yet

859
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:55,700
or you can Skype us, user name OrangeLoungeRadio.

860
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,620
But I'm noticing the phones are a little dead tonight.

861
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:59,240
It's a little weird for us.

862
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,840
We usually have like tons of people calling in,

863
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:01,680
but not tonight.

864
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:02,500
It is a three-day weekend.

865
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,960
Everyone is kind of on vacation.

866
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,720
Out drinkin' at their local Labor Day barbecues.

867
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,920
You know, do you know what was going on?

868
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,240
Do you know?

869
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,080
No, I don't know.

870
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:12,900
Zords, come on.

871
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:15,660
Do you know what was going on in town here locally tonight?

872
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:16,500
No.

873
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:20,340
And I'm here at this show instead of being at this event.

874
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:23,460
There's a big gay pride fest going on downtown.

875
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:27,000
In this, they have Riken from The Amazing Race.

876
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,220
I know you love him.

877
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:31,580
And probably his boyfriend Lance Bass is there too.

878
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:35,060
Tiffany and Debbie Gibson on the same stage.

879
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:37,940
That sounds terrible.

880
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:40,220
Yeah, but you're a homophobic gay man.

881
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:41,580
That's true, but it's still terrible.

882
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:43,340
That's how I describe you to all my friends, Shane.

883
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,660
You're a homophobic gay man.

884
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:45,180
I know.

885
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:45,860
All right.

886
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:47,180
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

887
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:49,940
Who's better, Tiffany or Debbie Gibson?

888
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:56,940
me. Hi, who's me? Me is Drunami. Drunami, you didn't sing Electric Youth, okay?

889
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:01,500
I could, if I knew what the hell it was. Have you been drinking tonight?

890
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:06,580
Uh, yes. Then I bet you could sing the first few bars of Electric Youth, come on.

891
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:11,900
I can make it up as I go. It's electric youth. I have no idea what you're talking about.

892
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:14,140
Alright, fine. What's on your mind then?

893
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:16,820
Uh, Miklotov

894
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:18,600
for one.

895
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:22,700
uh... sukodin sucks and you suck too for not being drunk

896
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,300
i don't drink anymore

897
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:28,000
you know i you know we have to respect his right to be sober it's fine

898
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,540
and we don't have to like it

899
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:36,540
Suikodin does not suck. Somebody has to drive you to life after the show. I'm just saying it to piss you off. You do know that. I haven't even fucking played sukodin.

900
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:40,960
I know this is just like last time. Did you call in to say anything intelligent?

901
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:44,100
or did you just come on to fuck up the show that's what i want to know

902
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,500
Yeah, I'm calling to fuck up the show, and, uh...

903
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:50,400
Then I'm hanging up on you, bitch, unless you have something intelligent to say!

904
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,800
Oh, uh, next time we do Beat the Hosts, I am so in.

905
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,800
I don't care!

906
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,600
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

907
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,600
Hello, this is NintendoManiac64.

908
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:04,400
Hi, NintendoManiac64, what's on your mind?

909
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,200
Um...

910
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:08,400
I just berated the last caller, so I'm in an angry mode.

911
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,100
So you better have something good to say, what's on your mind?

912
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:13,500
Well, this is just a simple question.

913
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:17,220
I sent in a response to the mailbag, but nobody read it.

914
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:18,180
We might have read it.

915
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:19,500
We just ignored it for now.

916
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:22,060
We might get into it next week.

917
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:23,940
Well, I guess we'll do your question,

918
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,220
since you have a question.

919
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:26,860
What is your question?

920
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:27,420
OK.

921
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:30,900
I remember something about last year or so

922
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:33,820
that you mentioned something about an Ogg-Vorbis stream.

923
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:34,940
Did that ever exist?

924
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:35,940
A what?

925
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:38,180
Like an Ogg-Vorbis stream?

926
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:39,980
Oh, OK.

927
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:45,500
that would involve us getting off of live 365 which right now we have other

928
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:50,260
options we're pursuing is all I can say right now so the OGG stream is a

929
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:53,660
little bit on hold it was something we were exploring previously we do know it

930
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:58,420
would give a little bit of a better sound than MP3 Pro but we're just not going to do it at

931
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:00,860
this time. Why? Is there something you want to say about OGG?

932
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:04,980
Well it's just that I thought of it and I'm like wait I know he said something about Ogg Vorbis

933
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:09,940
screen but I had no idea what so okay so it must be like a future idea or

934
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:13,940
something um yes but we have another future idea that's taking precedence

935
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:19,340
and that's all I can say at this time lame sorry do you have any comments on

936
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:33,260
tonight's stories otherwise no okay I'm bored let's go I need to drink more

937
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:43,780
I'm sorry, I do love the collars, I really do.

938
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:48,020
I think this is what every iTunes reviewer has always wanted us to do to the calls.

939
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:50,500
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

940
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,420
Hello, this is Jayden.

941
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:54,420
Hi Jayden, what's on your mind buddy?

942
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:59,100
Keep in mind I'm in a bad mood, so make it good.

943
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:05,100
I'm just reading all these DS reviews, I guess you could say.

944
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:08,100
What's up? Like what DS reviews?

945
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:09,100
Pardon me?

946
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:11,100
You say DS reviews?

947
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:13,100
Yes, DS reviews.

948
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:15,100
Okay, what's on your mind with the DS reviews?

949
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:21,100
Actually all these new products, or actually all these full products that I saw for the DS.

950
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:25,100
Wait, who's writing the DS reviews? Because I want to know if I value their opinion or not.

951
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,100
or not?

952
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:31,500
Um, actually they're not reviews, they're just products that I think are pretty cool

953
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:32,500
for the DS.

954
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,700
Alright, well what are they?

955
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:46,180
Like I found the DS Rumble Pack, I also found the DS TV Tuner, I also found the DS Memory

956
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:47,180
Expansion.

957
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:48,460
Is this a website or something?

958
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:54,460
Um, no, I just have a friend that's looking up random, uh, random DS things.

959
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:57,460
Okay. Oh, are you gonna buy these, or what?

960
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:00,460
I mean, he's thinking about it, actually.

961
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:02,460
Okay.

962
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:08,460
So, on top of that, um, about your game, Beat the Host.

963
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:12,460
Yes! Beat the Host! We love Beat the Host.

964
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:19,100
Yes. You want to get into some really oddball stuff, how about you do stuff from the Atari era?

965
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:26,260
Okay, look. If you say it, though, then everybody's prepared for it so it's not so offbeat. You know what I mean?

966
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:26,760
True.

967
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:30,460
Okay, I do like the idea of Atari 2600 stuff, but here's the problem.

968
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:39,460
A lot of the folks that listen to our program are like 17, and weren't even a sperm yet when Atari 2600 was out.

969
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:41,540
Oh, okay.

970
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:45,540
So, I don't know. I mean, I guess we could, but I don't know.

971
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:48,540
Would you do an Atari 2600 beat the host?

972
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:51,540
Maybe. I would probably get it less right.

973
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:54,540
Well, here's the thing is a lot of Atari 2600 games didn't have music.

974
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:57,540
We will take it under consideration for the future.

975
01:00:57,540 --> 01:00:58,540
How's that sound?

976
01:00:58,540 --> 01:00:59,540
Pardon?

977
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:04,540
We will take it under consideration for the future. How's that sound?

978
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:06,540
Yeah, that would sound pretty good.

979
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:07,540
Alright.

980
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:10,540
An Atari 2600 games did have music.

981
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:14,900
very very very little though but you know like if you are

982
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:18,300
okay like if you play that sound from pac-man that doo doo doo doo

983
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:22,300
I would totally know that I mean there certain games have those key sounds

984
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:23,220
you'll never forget

985
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:26,380
well yeah also

986
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:29,740
you're also you're forgetting the

987
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:33,580
Atari 7800, the Atari 800, the Atari 400

988
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:36,580
wait okay now you're just getting crazy because

989
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:40,260
not that many people play those systems I mean we could I guess

990
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:43,640
But then why don't I throw in VIC-20 games while we're at it? Come on.

991
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:46,880
Hey, that would be a pretty good idea.

992
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:50,720
What? You need to throw in those Tiger electronic cells.

993
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:54,400
But that's assuming that the host would be able to get any points at all. We

994
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,440
don't want to embarrass ourselves through this game.

995
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:00,360
But you have to cover all genres of games.

996
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:03,780
Alright, we'll think about it. We're taking all your suggestions under consideration.

997
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:06,180
Thank you for your feedback. Anything else you want to share with the listeners?

998
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:09,360
No, I just... Alright, then that's it.

999
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:16,320
let's get you you're so mean i'm sorry jaded's a good guy too he

1000
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:20,320
really supports us i shouldn't have hung up on him but i'm just feeling a little

1001
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:24,560
i'm a little feisty tonight um should we do one more call

1002
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:27,600
do you want to see if anybody else would call since we're doing short calls

1003
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,680
tonight you're only short because you keep

1004
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:34,640
hanging up on them why am i so loud oh because i have the

1005
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:37,040
because i don't know our callers have been kind of quiet so i had to turn it

1006
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:38,040
up in the studio.

1007
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:39,040
Okay.

1008
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:40,040
I don't know, our phone's not ringing now.

1009
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:41,040
So maybe that's it.

1010
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,040
Does anybody have a last minute story?

1011
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:44,040
We'll see if the phone rings during the last minute story.

1012
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:45,040
I have lots of last minute stories.

1013
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:46,040
Alright, give us one real quick.

1014
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,840
Well anyways, let's talk about the PS3.

1015
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:49,840
Guess what?

1016
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:53,000
You pay $600 for it, you get no HDMI cable.

1017
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:59,520
So it sucks to be you hooking it up to a high end media center or something like that.

1018
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,560
So yeah, whatever.

1019
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:08,000
And then of course, some other things, speaking since he was talking about, well they were

1020
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:14,040
talking about accessories for the DS, Europe is supposed to be seeing a DS MP3 player this

1021
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:17,240
October, so that's kind of neat.

1022
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:24,520
And supposedly it's going to be using the flash, what was it, just like those SD memory

1023
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:25,520
cards.

1024
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:28,020
Alright, we're getting another call on the Skypline so I'm going to go to that right

1025
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:29,020
now okay?

1026
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:30,020
Okie dokie.

1027
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:38,680
launch radio who's this no one it's a crank call crank call okay and the last

1028
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:46,880
one I had which was really cool there's five games that are coming to Xbox Live

1029
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:52,880
arcade from the video and you might know them Vidi who happened to be they own

1030
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:56,840
the rights to the Sierra games so we're gonna be getting wonderful games like

1031
01:03:56,840 --> 01:04:01,840
Megaforce, which I never played, 3D Ultra Mini Golf, which was fucking awesome on the

1032
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:08,680
PC and I used to play this online all the time, Red Baron, and two other games, one

1033
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:14,840
based on The Incredible Machine and one based on the popular TV series Battlestar Galactica.

1034
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:19,360
I am incredibly excited about The Incredible Machine game, which is kind of ironic.

1035
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:21,340
Wait, where is The Incredible Machine coming out?

1036
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:22,340
Xbox Live Arcade.

1037
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:24,760
Oh my god, that is hot.

1038
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:25,760
That is so hot.

1039
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:26,760
I love The Incredible Machine.

1040
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:33,400
one of the best games they ever did. I love that game. Dude, Sierra or Vivendi who I guess

1041
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:39,920
now owns all the Sierra shit? Yeah. Seriously? King's Quest? King's Quest, Space Quest, Leisure

1042
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:45,400
Suit Larry, bring me these games on a console. Yes, I know I can get most of that stuff through

1043
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:49,840
GameTap and that's cool, but you know I played those games on a computer before. I want to

1044
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:56,260
do something on a console. I want achievement points for King's Quest 4. Is that too much

1045
01:04:56,260 --> 01:05:03,600
to ask. You want to know something funny and this is just purely observational. Gamersreports.com,

1046
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:07,140
they have a banner, you know how they have banner ads on websites and stuff like that?

1047
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:12,840
This one has a banner ad for a London escort service. I just thought that was kind of funny.

1048
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:19,060
Cause they have escorts on a gaming news site. I don't know. I'm easily amused tonight. Yeah

1049
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:24,760
I know I'm I'm oh yeah and I'm a little bit there's rumors about rez coming to

1050
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:29,440
the weeb oh yeah yeah I'll be kind of cool yeah I don't know if that's really

1051
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:33,880
anything you know I don't know they've actually got info to back that up but

1052
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:38,980
uh it's probably one of those yeah that would be cool that you know I'm

1053
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:44,280
seriously considering it yeah that was the the the quote here I'm currently

1054
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:48,800
seriously considering it it's always been there it's always I'm always

1055
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:51,760
thinking about it also space channel 5

1056
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:56,240
yes space channel 5 is so awesome

1057
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:59,520
I love that game space channel 5 on the

1058
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:02,120
we do I just can you imagine that like

1059
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:03,960
where you'd have to do like the motions

1060
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,640
for like different dances and stuff so

1061
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:08,320
you chew chew so you'd be doing the

1062
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:10,360
dances to that kind of funny

1063
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:14,400
alright anything else that's it that's

1064
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,280
going to bring our show to a close them

1065
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:18,520
for this evening I like to go around to

1066
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:21,560
to get everybody's final thought thank you guys by the way for tuning in

1067
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:25,520
supporting independent radio I know we were a little crazy tonight and you know

1068
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:28,760
we appreciate you guys sticking by us no matter what mikkel tov thank you for

1069
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:32,680
being here even though you barely ever talked at all I'm reading what are you

1070
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:35,440
reading what's more important you're chatting on instant messenger at least

1071
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:39,520
be honest well I'm also reading about blue me who are you chatting with on

1072
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:43,400
instant messenger jazz and I don't remember his name on DDR freaking that

1073
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:51,840
That makes me angry, but the guy that sent the cookies for Ultramix 2, I only know him

1074
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:52,840
by his real name now.

1075
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:53,840
I don't remember.

1076
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,360
I know his name on Xbox Live, but I can't.

1077
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:56,360
El Mullet.

1078
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:57,360
El Mullet, yes.

1079
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:59,720
I'm talking to El Mullet.

1080
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:00,720
How's he doing?

1081
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:01,720
I haven't heard from him in a while.

1082
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:02,720
I guess he's doing this.

1083
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:03,720
Does he still listen to this show?

1084
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:04,720
I have no idea because I didn't ask him.

1085
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:05,720
Ask him if he's listening.

1086
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:06,720
I'll maybe do that later.

1087
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:07,720
Fine.

1088
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:09,200
We're talking about Dance Factory right now.

1089
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,200
Alright, fine.

1090
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:11,400
Yeah, that game came out last week.

1091
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:14,200
Yeah, and it's pretty stupid from what I understand, but it's getting good scores.

1092
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,200
It is getting good scores.

1093
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,600
Yeah, you know what the scores are?

1094
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,700
Well, cuz then you can put any song in it.

1095
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:21,200
Yeah, but all those dance steps are probably crap.

1096
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,100
Yeah, and off sync apparently.

1097
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:25,900
And it's iToy mode doesn't work, I guess.

1098
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:27,600
Which makes it equally cool.

1099
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:32,800
Yeah, they have a bundle with a really crappy dance pad coming out in October.

1100
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:33,400
I thought that was funny.

1101
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:37,000
That's something I'll be skipping.

1102
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,300
You know what game they should put out over here that's coming out in the UK?

1103
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:40,300
What?

1104
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:41,900
uh... b boy

1105
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:43,360
they look pretty cool

1106
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:45,520
and vaguely remember that

1107
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:49,860
it's like uh... you know break-dancing yeah but it's not the art that have like

1108
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:50,500
uh...

1109
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:53,100
buses a group here

1110
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:55,780
and i would love that actually that'd be a great

1111
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:56,860
great thing

1112
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:58,540
and you know they need

1113
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:01,060
who was it uh...

1114
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:02,460
the tango game

1115
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:06,900
x tango stang x tingles do whatever happened out of the show next thing like
