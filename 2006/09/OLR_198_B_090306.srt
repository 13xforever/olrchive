2
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:25,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 198 for this September the 3rd, 2006.

3
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:31,298
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're listening to us on the podcast feed, remember that Orange Lounge Radio is distributed in two parts.

4
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:37,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Part A rolls out Monday morning, and Part B rolls out somewhere between Tuesday and Wednesday, whenever we feel like it.

5
00:00:37,843 --> 00:00:42,106
[SPEAKER_09]: So you have to go back and listen to Part A to really get the full experience of what's going on tonight.

6
00:00:42,447 --> 00:00:46,110
[SPEAKER_09]: And what is going on tonight is that Loki and I have been partaking in a little bit of...

7
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Alcohol, because this is a three-day weekend.

8
00:00:48,571 --> 00:00:50,192
[SPEAKER_09]: But please, drink responsibly.

9
00:00:50,552 --> 00:00:53,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Do not follow our example unless you are responsible, like we are.

10
00:00:53,534 --> 00:00:55,375
[SPEAKER_09]: We have Mikl Tov here, who's completely sober.

11
00:00:55,715 --> 00:00:56,555
[SPEAKER_09]: Our special guest tonight.

12
00:00:56,615 --> 00:00:56,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

13
00:00:57,136 --> 00:00:57,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Babysitting us.

14
00:00:58,396 --> 00:00:58,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope.

15
00:00:59,597 --> 00:01:01,958
[SPEAKER_09]: So go back to Part A and catch up on your Orange Lounge Radio.

16
00:01:02,338 --> 00:01:07,081
[SPEAKER_09]: And for now, we'll get back into the gaming news on this Part B. Loki, start it off.

17
00:01:09,322 --> 00:01:09,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

18
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, to start things off...

19
00:01:13,536 --> 00:01:17,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said in part A, I've been playing some Saints Row and got some good news.

20
00:01:17,779 --> 00:01:19,440
[SPEAKER_07]: There's new download content coming soon.

21
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:30,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, this content, I'm not sure if it's going to be downloadable through live or through kiosks, because if you remember correctly, and this really hasn't been advertised too much, but

22
00:01:30,847 --> 00:01:40,315
[SPEAKER_07]: The demo kiosks that are in your Best Buys and GameStops and whatnot, they actually do have content you can download off of there onto a memory card.

23
00:01:40,796 --> 00:01:50,244
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you do happen to have one of the memory units for the 360, you might be able to get some good stuff, including some brand new outfits and clothing for your Saints Row characters.

24
00:01:50,724 --> 00:02:00,247
[SPEAKER_07]: including such wacky things like a samurai helmet, a leather eye patch, a fake tuxedo t-shirt, which is awesome, some tropical shirt.

25
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:03,708
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you get a Moo Moo like you can in Dead Rising?

26
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that is the best costume ever.

27
00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:07,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Possibly, but not yet at least.

28
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,890
[SPEAKER_09]: You can get a spike leather jacket.

29
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Who made Saints Row?

30
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:11,130
[SPEAKER_07]: THQ?

31
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:11,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Dear THQ,

32
00:02:13,571 --> 00:02:33,687
[SPEAKER_07]: MooMoo, please, thanks, LoveSky, OrangeLounge Anywho, you've also got leopard slash tiger skin boxers, leather chaps, crazy bunny slippers, a skull ring, a Saints Row medallion, and Saints Row wristband, as well as some tattoos.

33
00:02:33,707 --> 00:02:40,072
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a large and small panther, rattlesnake, biohazard sign, an ankh, and a spider.

34
00:02:41,253 --> 00:02:41,413
[SPEAKER_07]: So,

35
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,621
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty sweet.

36
00:02:42,842 --> 00:02:46,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, you can get it pretty soon.

37
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:51,738
[SPEAKER_07]: They've already got some screenshots of these things, including someone who's wearing all of them at the same time.

38
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:52,860
[SPEAKER_07]: He looks like a freak.

39
00:02:54,477 --> 00:02:58,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, of course, some folks are noticing the Saints Row has a few problems with it.

40
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:04,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, Volition, one of the developers of the game there, they are aware of the problems and they are working on a patch right now.

41
00:03:05,022 --> 00:03:06,902
[SPEAKER_09]: And these are things that are supposed to be in the patch.

42
00:03:07,363 --> 00:03:11,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Improvements to the way the game handles packet loss and bandwidth management between players.

43
00:03:12,245 --> 00:03:17,847
[SPEAKER_09]: This will address lag and general synchronization problems between the players' clients and so on.

44
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:23,149
[SPEAKER_09]: The system for rating a player's quality of service has been improved and made less conservative.

45
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:25,850
[SPEAKER_09]: This means you'll see many more matches with 10-12 player limits.

46
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:36,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Fixed for the closed stealing exploit in multiplayer, fixed for widescreen formatting issues in certain resolutions, and changes to the matchmaking phase to get players in the game faster.

47
00:03:38,014 --> 00:03:40,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of like that first Halo 2 patch did a lot of that.

48
00:03:40,815 --> 00:03:47,757
[SPEAKER_07]: That's good, because I know the multiplayer as it is right now, at least the game I played, was pretty unplayable.

49
00:03:48,297 --> 00:03:53,039
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, on my friends list on Xbox Live, Saints Row is easily the most popular game right now.

50
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:55,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody ever plays Final Fantasy XI on my friends list.

51
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,620
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen maybe one other person playing Enchanted Arms.

52
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,280
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what?

53
00:03:58,481 --> 00:03:58,641
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

54
00:03:58,681 --> 00:04:01,061
[SPEAKER_07]: And we do have a gang on Saints Row.

55
00:04:01,221 --> 00:04:02,882
[SPEAKER_07]: The OLL Army is there.

56
00:04:03,482 --> 00:04:05,983
[SPEAKER_07]: And all you need to do, it's pretty simple.

57
00:04:07,003 --> 00:04:08,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me know if you've got the game.

58
00:04:08,824 --> 00:04:12,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Send an invite if you're not a friend of Loki OLR already.

59
00:04:13,246 --> 00:04:15,827
[SPEAKER_07]: And basically what I'll do is I'll send an invite to join the gang.

60
00:04:16,187 --> 00:04:17,067
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've done that already.

61
00:04:18,307 --> 00:04:19,647
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a thread in our forums, right?

62
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:20,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there is a thread.

63
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:24,608
[SPEAKER_07]: But even people, like I see them playing Saints Row, I'll send them an invite.

64
00:04:24,648 --> 00:04:26,589
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll jump in the game real quick and send an invite.

65
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:29,709
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, try that out.

66
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:31,690
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'm just trying to get some people to join up.

67
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:40,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, we're not really going all hardcore at this, but I think later on down the line it would be fun to do a multiplayer game, maybe Deathmatch versus everyone.

68
00:04:40,651 --> 00:04:41,451
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be kind of fun.

69
00:04:41,812 --> 00:04:44,012
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, something to think about.

70
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:45,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Fun game, though, multiplayer.

71
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:46,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm curious to check it out.

72
00:04:47,007 --> 00:04:51,930
[SPEAKER_09]: I notice other podcasters on my friends list are playing the hell out of this game, like GamerAndy.

73
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,691
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think I've seen playing anything else but this.

74
00:04:54,612 --> 00:04:57,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Godfrey from Gamertag has been playing a crap load of Saints Row.

75
00:04:57,814 --> 00:05:02,757
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think we need to form a gang and take some of those guys on in a multi-podcast tournament.

76
00:05:02,957 --> 00:05:06,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully it will work this time, unlike a certain Chrome House tournament.

77
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,321
[SPEAKER_07]: This is my only stipulation.

78
00:05:08,661 --> 00:05:10,322
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

79
00:05:28,467 --> 00:05:31,309
[SPEAKER_09]: If you don't have Saints Row yet, there might be some other games you can get soon.

80
00:05:31,429 --> 00:05:33,351
[SPEAKER_07]: There are some other games for the US.

81
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:34,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of stuff actually coming out.

82
00:05:35,872 --> 00:05:41,697
[SPEAKER_07]: This week, of course, if you're a NASCAR fan, you can look forward to it on the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and the PSP.

83
00:05:42,597 --> 00:05:51,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Also on those systems, well, not the PSP, but you're going to be getting Spy Hunter Nowhere to Run, which is kind of a classic remake of the old

84
00:05:52,532 --> 00:05:56,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Arcade Shooter Series, also which is supposed to be coming out as a movie later on.

85
00:05:56,974 --> 00:06:04,977
[SPEAKER_07]: For your 360 fans, Test Drive Unlimited is coming out as well as Xbox Live Arcade Unplugged Volume 1 will be also hitting the streets.

86
00:06:06,457 --> 00:06:16,621
[SPEAKER_07]: LocoRoco is coming out on the PSP this week and Yakuza on the PlayStation 2 is going to be coming out this week and those are going to be the big ones for this week.

87
00:06:17,268 --> 00:06:26,753
[SPEAKER_07]: and also of course next week the big thing is probably going to be LEGO Star Wars 2 as well as Rulerose which I hopefully look forward to talking to or about soon.

88
00:06:27,494 --> 00:06:30,395
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, that's pretty much it.

89
00:06:33,117 --> 00:06:34,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you have news about price drops too?

90
00:06:35,358 --> 00:06:36,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah yes, I did.

91
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:39,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of fun stuff getting price drops.

92
00:06:40,061 --> 00:06:44,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, D3 announced this week that Naruto the

93
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:47,890
[SPEAKER_07]: What was it?

94
00:06:48,571 --> 00:06:58,018
[SPEAKER_07]: The Game Boy Advance game, Ninja Council, is going to be added to the player choice lineup as well as... And they will pay you $5 to play their game.

95
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:00,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, that game wasn't that bad.

96
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:01,140
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just teasing, I'm teasing.

97
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,760
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think.

98
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,441
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, sheesh.

99
00:07:02,941 --> 00:07:05,003
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, they were getting added.

100
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Come to the Dark Side Bismarck Server

101
00:07:34,232 --> 00:07:40,980
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you really can't wait for some FIFA action, FIFA World Cup 06 for the 360 has dropped down to $39.99 as well.

102
00:07:41,601 --> 00:07:43,643
[SPEAKER_07]: FIFA 07, of course, coming out in October.

103
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:47,188
[SPEAKER_07]: So, not too far off, but... I still gotta wait.

104
00:07:48,115 --> 00:07:48,655
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura

105
00:08:08,647 --> 00:08:09,808
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it was worth the wait.

106
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:11,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, probably not.

107
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:16,875
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing I don't like about the box art, no representation for the ServBot head.

108
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,596
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.

109
00:08:17,636 --> 00:08:20,899
[SPEAKER_09]: But the game is pretty hot, so you guys in Europe have been waiting long enough for it.

110
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:22,060
[SPEAKER_09]: So you finally get it on the 8th.

111
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Enchanted Arms is also coming out for you guys on the 8th.

112
00:08:25,483 --> 00:08:29,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Also coming out for you guys, Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins on the PSP.

113
00:08:29,387 --> 00:08:31,048
[SPEAKER_09]: I forgot that was also coming out this week here.

114
00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:33,751
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're a PC gamer, you have two games coming out.

115
00:08:34,051 --> 00:08:37,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Secret Files, Tunguska, and Warfront Turning Point.

116
00:08:37,752 --> 00:08:45,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Looking ahead to the week of the 15th on the PC, Call of Juarez, Faces of War, GTR 2, Broken Sword, The Angel of Death.

117
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:52,138
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you're a little bit more of a console gamer, you do have Yakuza and NASCAR 07 to look forward to on the PlayStation 2.

118
00:08:52,718 --> 00:08:59,921
[SPEAKER_09]: And, should be pointed out, calendared right now for September 16th, Miku Tavio like this, UK finally getting Suikoden V.

119
00:09:01,522 --> 00:09:02,443
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care about them.

120
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, you're polite.

121
00:09:05,965 --> 00:09:06,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

122
00:09:06,325 --> 00:09:07,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you like Suikoden V?

123
00:09:07,466 --> 00:09:08,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it a good game in the series?

124
00:09:08,866 --> 00:09:14,690
[SPEAKER_09]: I think so, but I helped write it, so... Which means we have to make double fun of it!

125
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:15,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay!

126
00:09:15,951 --> 00:09:20,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Gosh, I wish we could get the original Japanese version instead, because the English version sucks.

127
00:09:22,315 --> 00:09:23,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody heard you.

128
00:09:23,175 --> 00:09:23,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Just kidding.

129
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:25,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Anywho.

130
00:09:27,117 --> 00:09:29,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of things that suck and happen to be from Konami...

131
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:34,270
[SPEAKER_07]: FunnyFungi, Stuntmant, and Daredevil

132
00:10:01,294 --> 00:10:02,374
[SPEAKER_07]: or Stuntman Daredevil.

133
00:10:02,454 --> 00:10:03,775
[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay.

134
00:10:03,915 --> 00:10:05,355
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't heard those.

135
00:10:06,115 --> 00:10:18,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, it's got a 2-inch backlit TFT LCD display screen as well as some fun little white shell for it that's also lime green, magenta, and orange.

136
00:10:19,277 --> 00:10:23,038
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll be able to be hooked up to your TV, kind of like a plug-and-play type of thing.

137
00:10:23,058 --> 00:10:28,179
[SPEAKER_07]: It's supposed to retail... Oh, and by the way, it does not come with the plug-and-play...

138
00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:29,839
[SPEAKER_07]: I really love you guys.

139
00:10:29,939 --> 00:10:32,880
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, seriously, Castlevania, DDR, Contra, Silent Hill, Gods Among Games.

140
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Even Suikoden's not that bad.

141
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:34,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Gods Among Games.

142
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,321
[SPEAKER_09]: But seriously, Konami...

143
00:10:53,513 --> 00:10:54,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Get over, Frogger.

144
00:10:55,376 --> 00:10:58,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Let the damn frog drown and be done with it.

145
00:10:59,162 --> 00:11:03,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, by the way... Put those resources towards something else, I beg of you.

146
00:11:03,809 --> 00:11:04,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Please.

147
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:06,313
[SPEAKER_09]: That is what the device looks like, by the way.

148
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,235
[SPEAKER_09]: That looks like poop.

149
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,183
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like a cheap knockoff of the Game Boy Advance.

150
00:11:13,263 --> 00:11:15,885
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks kind of like a WonderSwan in a weird way.

151
00:11:16,486 --> 00:11:17,046
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, to me.

152
00:11:17,186 --> 00:11:19,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it's just the button layout kind of reminds me of WonderSwan.

153
00:11:19,588 --> 00:11:19,949
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

154
00:11:19,969 --> 00:11:21,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Perhaps I'm crazy.

155
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,911
[SPEAKER_07]: You know who you can really blame for this?

156
00:11:23,031 --> 00:11:25,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Pelican, because they're the one putting it out.

157
00:11:27,334 --> 00:11:28,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, fun, fun.

158
00:11:29,816 --> 00:11:30,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Hooray, hooray.

159
00:11:30,877 --> 00:11:33,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, look, moving on to other games.

160
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:35,221
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to see if there's any feedback in our chat room.

161
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:46,903
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkTetsuya says, every effing Frogger game, he can't swim.

162
00:11:46,944 --> 00:11:48,645
[SPEAKER_09]: He's a frog for crying out loud.

163
00:11:49,345 --> 00:11:49,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Good point.

164
00:11:50,246 --> 00:11:52,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Jeremy Todd 1 says, let the frog get run over by a semi already.

165
00:11:53,388 --> 00:11:55,830
[SPEAKER_09]: That's our chat room, www.orangeonsradio.com.

166
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:56,370
[SPEAKER_09]: Click on chat.

167
00:11:57,913 --> 00:11:58,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

168
00:11:58,453 --> 00:12:04,455
[SPEAKER_09]: I am so excited about this port to the DS, or at least I was when I first read about it, and then I was a little bit disappointed.

169
00:12:05,495 --> 00:12:10,377
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the most underlooked Super Nintendo games of all time that was so great was SimCity on the Super Nintendo.

170
00:12:10,957 --> 00:12:24,541
[SPEAKER_09]: And yes, I know it was a PC game to begin with, and the PC game was awesome too, but the Super Nintendo version kind of added the cuteness factor to it that made the game very cool, although my favorite version of this game will always be the one that was on CD-ROM.

171
00:12:24,801 --> 00:12:25,902
[SPEAKER_09]: SimCity on the DS except then I read this

172
00:12:45,157 --> 00:12:46,597
[SPEAKER_09]: It's based on SimCity 3000.

173
00:12:47,338 --> 00:12:52,379
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I went, NO!

174
00:12:52,659 --> 00:12:54,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I hate SimCity 3000.

175
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,181
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, nothing will never be as good as the original.

176
00:12:58,841 --> 00:12:59,241
[SPEAKER_09]: For me.

177
00:13:00,202 --> 00:13:01,882
[SPEAKER_05]: I like SimCity 4, it's really fun.

178
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:05,964
[SPEAKER_09]: If you like SimCity 3000, then maybe you'll get a kick out of this SimCity DS.

179
00:13:06,464 --> 00:13:07,904
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got three main modes of play.

180
00:13:08,004 --> 00:13:10,565
[SPEAKER_09]: Build the City, Save the City, and Sister City.

181
00:13:11,539 --> 00:13:14,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Sister City Mode lets you chat with other players and trade landmarks.

182
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:15,863
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's kind of cool.

183
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:18,806
[SPEAKER_09]: Something to look forward to for you DS fans.

184
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:26,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, one good thing for Nintendo is Tecmo is supporting the Wii's Virtual Console aggressively.

185
00:13:27,794 --> 00:13:28,875
[SPEAKER_07]: And what does this mean?

186
00:13:29,135 --> 00:13:33,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it probably means that you're going to be able to play such wonderful games like Tecmo Bowl.

187
00:13:34,265 --> 00:13:34,846
[SPEAKER_07]: and stuff like that.

188
00:13:35,186 --> 00:13:41,734
[SPEAKER_07]: They have not said exactly which games are going to be supported on there, but it is going to be coming with lots of stuff.

189
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:42,915
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.

190
00:13:43,035 --> 00:13:47,701
[SPEAKER_07]: I like to see that they're supporting it and maybe we'll get some Ninja Gaiden stuff as well.

191
00:13:50,828 --> 00:13:52,169
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, very cool.

192
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:56,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I'd like to go to a story about the Wii, talking about the Wiimote.

193
00:13:57,933 --> 00:14:01,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically what's going on, there could be some production issues going on right now.

194
00:14:02,235 --> 00:14:09,260
[SPEAKER_09]: GoNintendo picked up a story that was going on about the Nintendo Wii, and there's a quote here on what's going on with the Wii production.

195
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:15,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Quote, the factory has received Wii controllers purchasing order in its sample, but is still stuck in testing phase.

196
00:14:16,274 --> 00:14:26,861
[SPEAKER_09]: From feedbacks of testers, currently the Wiimote and Nunchuck still have a lot of small issues, such as the buttons not being sensitive, it's hard to press two buttons together, and no response occasionally.

197
00:14:27,301 --> 00:14:29,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-oh, could this be a bad sign for the Wii?

198
00:14:29,362 --> 00:14:31,323
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, the thing felt fine to me at E3.

199
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,445
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what this thing's talking about, but whatever.

200
00:14:33,965 --> 00:14:36,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly, I mean, come on, they've already produced some already.

201
00:14:37,187 --> 00:14:39,849
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see why, you know, it didn't seem that hard to play with at E3.

202
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:40,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

203
00:14:42,657 --> 00:14:43,538
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

204
00:15:06,135 --> 00:15:07,476
[SPEAKER_07]: They should be able to get it right.

205
00:15:28,986 --> 00:15:34,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we are going to go to the Skype line right now because I noticed we're getting a call in right now on the Skype line.

206
00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:36,330
[SPEAKER_09]: I definitely want to take this call.

207
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,311
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio, are you there?

208
00:15:39,552 --> 00:15:40,592
[SPEAKER_10]: I am, sort of.

209
00:15:40,953 --> 00:15:42,153
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, is that Jamie?

210
00:15:42,914 --> 00:15:43,514
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it is.

211
00:15:43,634 --> 00:15:44,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Jamie.

212
00:15:44,294 --> 00:15:44,795
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you?

213
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,156
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm doing okay.

214
00:15:47,236 --> 00:15:48,997
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been a very busy day.

215
00:15:49,297 --> 00:15:49,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah?

216
00:15:49,877 --> 00:15:51,818
[SPEAKER_09]: What kinds of stuff have you been doing to celebrate your anniversary?

217
00:15:51,878 --> 00:15:54,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy anniversary, by the way, from all of us at Orange Lounge Radio and our chat room and all that.

218
00:15:55,765 --> 00:15:56,265
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

219
00:15:56,366 --> 00:16:01,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Friday, I came home, there were roses waiting for me, which made me all happy.

220
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,271
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, you know, I am a girl.

221
00:16:03,411 --> 00:16:04,732
[SPEAKER_10]: I like girl things sometimes.

222
00:16:06,314 --> 00:16:06,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

223
00:16:07,475 --> 00:16:11,077
[SPEAKER_10]: And we went out to eat at this place called Fats, which was me actually after we ate.

224
00:16:11,798 --> 00:16:15,221
[SPEAKER_10]: But no, it's this place in Roseville that's like an expensive Chinese place.

225
00:16:16,499 --> 00:16:23,265
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, one of the people I met at Disneyland, who is also somebody I've been watching on DeviantArt, she worked at Disneyland until just recently and was going around putting those plushy snakes on different characters' heads.

226
00:16:40,996 --> 00:16:41,836
[SPEAKER_10]: It's in a journal.

227
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:42,457
[SPEAKER_10]: It's funny.

228
00:16:42,837 --> 00:16:44,037
[SPEAKER_10]: She did, like, Snakes on a Hatter.

229
00:16:44,277 --> 00:16:46,698
[SPEAKER_10]: There's movie files of the Mad Hatter and Alice playing with snakes.

230
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:50,140
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's been about, what, two weeks since you've been to Disneyland and you still haven't stopped talking about it?

231
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,760
[SPEAKER_10]: I love Disneyland.

232
00:16:52,081 --> 00:16:52,441
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I know.

233
00:16:52,501 --> 00:16:52,841
[SPEAKER_09]: It's great.

234
00:16:53,121 --> 00:16:54,141
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, how was your gaming week?

235
00:16:54,161 --> 00:16:55,322
[SPEAKER_09]: What kind of games have you been playing this week?

236
00:16:56,022 --> 00:16:57,443
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I just got done playing a game.

237
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:59,343
[SPEAKER_10]: The newest addition to the pinball collection.

238
00:16:59,644 --> 00:16:59,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-oh.

239
00:16:59,924 --> 00:17:00,544
[SPEAKER_09]: What'd you guys get?

240
00:17:01,424 --> 00:17:03,145
[SPEAKER_10]: Star Trek The Next Generation Pinball.

241
00:17:03,225 --> 00:17:04,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, that's awesome.

242
00:17:04,165 --> 00:17:05,326
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a great pinball table.

243
00:17:06,147 --> 00:17:06,548
[SPEAKER_10]: It is.

244
00:17:06,688 --> 00:17:12,696
[SPEAKER_10]: And the thing about it, Dan got it for pretty much a steal, given that the machines go for, what, $3,000, $4,000?

245
00:17:12,756 --> 00:17:13,537
[SPEAKER_10]: He's in the bathroom.

246
00:17:13,557 --> 00:17:15,460
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, don't take the phone to the bathroom, please.

247
00:17:19,557 --> 00:17:28,661
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but we got it for a pretty good price, and it needs a lot of work to it, but it came with a bunch of extra ramps and stuff, and Dan's going to put some work into it.

248
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:31,002
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually went ahead and played it, but we had the glass off.

249
00:17:31,402 --> 00:17:36,084
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, my God, 10-mile issues are loud when they have no glass on them, so we were cheating and hitting the targets.

250
00:17:37,505 --> 00:17:38,585
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a little bit of cheating.

251
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:39,265
[SPEAKER_09]: That's cool, though.

252
00:17:39,285 --> 00:17:42,907
[SPEAKER_10]: We were, like, throwing the ball at the Delta Quadrant ramp and everything.

253
00:17:42,967 --> 00:17:43,567
[SPEAKER_10]: It was really cool.

254
00:17:44,307 --> 00:17:45,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you play any console games at all?

255
00:17:46,744 --> 00:17:48,285
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I have Enchanted Arms.

256
00:17:48,365 --> 00:17:51,508
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't actually played it yet because I've been sort of busy with the whole anniversary thing.

257
00:17:52,329 --> 00:17:53,550
[SPEAKER_10]: And I played some Super Mario Brothers.

258
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,813
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to play it before the next show because I want to know what you think of Makoto.

259
00:17:58,194 --> 00:17:59,295
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I will play it.

260
00:17:59,335 --> 00:18:00,336
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a gay guy in it.

261
00:18:01,196 --> 00:18:01,737
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

262
00:18:01,977 --> 00:18:02,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's interesting.

263
00:18:02,938 --> 00:18:03,699
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I have to say.

264
00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:05,840
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, that makes my inner hag happy.

265
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:07,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, you've been playing Super Mario Brothers?

266
00:18:07,262 --> 00:18:09,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Like the new Super Mario Brothers or the old one?

267
00:18:09,784 --> 00:18:10,725
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I got one for free.

268
00:18:11,065 --> 00:18:11,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, cool.

269
00:18:11,886 --> 00:18:12,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cool.

270
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:14,482
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been giving it some play.

271
00:18:14,862 --> 00:18:18,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you have any news you wanted to share with the listeners tonight since you're not here?

272
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, no.

273
00:18:21,846 --> 00:18:24,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I did release dates for you and we did mailbag.

274
00:18:25,067 --> 00:18:25,648
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, cool.

275
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:37,854
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually, I've been conversing with a few of our listeners being, I've been sort of, I looked into the box, I'll be honest, I thought that since you would check it for me, I was like, oh, I'll handle that tonight.

276
00:18:39,015 --> 00:18:39,615
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all good.

277
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Have fun with your weekend off and all that fun stuff.

278
00:18:44,121 --> 00:18:47,363
[SPEAKER_10]: I will be there next weekend with a vengeance.

279
00:18:47,383 --> 00:18:47,363
$199.

280
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:47,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you believe it?

281
00:18:47,923 --> 00:18:48,743
[SPEAKER_09]: We're almost at episode 200.

282
00:18:49,224 --> 00:18:49,744
[SPEAKER_09]: It's crazy.

283
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:50,905
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, wow.

284
00:18:50,965 --> 00:18:51,925
[SPEAKER_10]: That's next week, isn't it?

285
00:18:52,105 --> 00:18:52,426
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

286
00:18:52,726 --> 00:18:53,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, no.

287
00:18:53,386 --> 00:18:54,227
[SPEAKER_09]: $199 is next week and then $200.

288
00:18:54,627 --> 00:18:55,187
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the same.

289
00:18:55,207 --> 00:18:55,887
[SPEAKER_10]: $199 is next week.

290
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:56,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

291
00:18:56,948 --> 00:18:57,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Craziness.

292
00:18:59,069 --> 00:19:00,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else you want to share with the listeners, DarkSakura?

293
00:19:02,651 --> 00:19:02,971
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

294
00:19:03,071 --> 00:19:03,612
[SPEAKER_10]: Give me a dollar.

295
00:19:04,392 --> 00:19:04,732
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

296
00:19:05,293 --> 00:19:07,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Put it in the DarkSakura's next anniversary fund.

297
00:19:07,728 --> 00:19:07,948
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

298
00:19:07,968 --> 00:19:10,309
[SPEAKER_09]: You can send those dollars to mailbag at OrangeScienceRadio.com.

299
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:11,370
[SPEAKER_09]: Sound good?

300
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Virtual dollars.

301
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:13,270
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

302
00:19:13,491 --> 00:19:14,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you can draw pictures of dollars.

303
00:19:14,751 --> 00:19:15,211
[SPEAKER_09]: It'd be awesome.

304
00:19:16,092 --> 00:19:16,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

305
00:19:16,512 --> 00:19:17,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, okay.

306
00:19:17,092 --> 00:19:18,213
[SPEAKER_10]: New Photoshop contest.

307
00:19:18,373 --> 00:19:19,553
[SPEAKER_10]: Best dollar wins.

308
00:19:19,913 --> 00:19:25,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I think they're doing a Photoshop contest right now on OrangeScienceRadio.com of best Orange Science Radio fake news.

309
00:19:25,576 --> 00:19:26,056
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty funny.

310
00:19:26,076 --> 00:19:27,096
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been looking at that.

311
00:19:27,136 --> 00:19:28,197
[SPEAKER_10]: It was pretty hilarious.

312
00:19:28,397 --> 00:19:29,477
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the first one.

313
00:19:29,677 --> 00:19:30,498
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's pretty awesome.

314
00:19:30,518 --> 00:19:33,159
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all done like the old Death Cake logo.

315
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:33,939
[SPEAKER_09]: It's great.

316
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,340
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

317
00:19:36,849 --> 00:19:38,389
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess that's it for now, DarkSakura.

318
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:39,150
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see you next week?

319
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:40,730
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, definitely.

320
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:41,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, take care.

321
00:19:41,411 --> 00:19:42,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for calling in.

322
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,391
[SPEAKER_10]: The other people will hear me.

323
00:19:44,032 --> 00:19:44,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, that works.

324
00:19:45,913 --> 00:19:47,193
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, oh, I have to say, wait.

325
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:48,834
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been drinking tonight.

326
00:19:49,674 --> 00:19:50,074
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, God.

327
00:19:50,134 --> 00:19:51,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you condone this action?

328
00:19:52,155 --> 00:19:52,796
[SPEAKER_10]: I fully do.

329
00:19:52,836 --> 00:19:53,936
[SPEAKER_10]: I was drinking the other night.

330
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:54,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

331
00:19:54,556 --> 00:19:55,757
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to be drinking tonight.

332
00:19:55,957 --> 00:19:56,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, sounds good.

333
00:19:57,018 --> 00:19:58,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Have fun, but not too much.

334
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:00,499
[SPEAKER_10]: And by the way, I need to talk to you later.

335
00:20:01,339 --> 00:20:01,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

336
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:02,780
[SPEAKER_09]: You know where to find me.

337
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,081
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, bye.

338
00:20:04,101 --> 00:20:04,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, bye.

339
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:11,971
[SPEAKER_09]: I like those, you know, totally personal messages in the middle of the show.

340
00:20:12,031 --> 00:20:12,512
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's fine.

341
00:20:12,792 --> 00:20:13,332
[SPEAKER_07]: It was funny.

342
00:20:14,632 --> 00:20:27,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Nellie was talking about how she wanted to bring you Long Island iced tea because she remembered that one time that you were at the old apartment and you were trying to run up the wall because you had Long Island iced tea.

343
00:20:27,855 --> 00:20:28,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I remember that.

344
00:20:28,996 --> 00:20:30,236
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a little bit crazy.

345
00:20:31,676 --> 00:20:31,997
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

346
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:32,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways...

347
00:20:34,778 --> 00:20:38,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Some interesting stuff I'm speaking about, kind of running and flailing and stuff like that.

348
00:20:39,899 --> 00:20:44,920
[SPEAKER_07]: They're looking for testers for the Wii, and you're going to be doing a lot of flailing.

349
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, there's some article posted on MTV News, and I'm sure they're the great source of gaming news.

350
00:20:51,782 --> 00:21:03,825
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyways, saying that they're going into more of the process of creating and testing the games, and some of the testers, for example, for Marvel Ultimate Alliance, that they...

351
00:21:06,235 --> 00:21:19,640
[SPEAKER_07]: You're actually doing a lot of flailing in order to perform some of the moves, because only the buttons are using for A to jump and stuff like that, but still, you've got to do a lot of gestures in order to actually be doing attacks and whatnot.

352
00:21:20,381 --> 00:21:29,365
[SPEAKER_07]: And that includes a lot of arm flailing and stuff like that, which should be interesting, because I can't imagine playing that four-player, staying next to your buddy or whatever, and swinging your arms around.

353
00:21:29,845 --> 00:21:30,205
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um,

354
00:21:31,061 --> 00:21:39,828
[SPEAKER_07]: The Wii is all the rage right now and folks can't wait to get their hands on that and I'm sure a lot of folks will be wanting to playtest it just to be able to say they played it early.

355
00:21:58,885 --> 00:22:05,527
[SPEAKER_09]: But one thing nobody seems to want to play is the Game Boy Micro, at least in the UK.

356
00:22:05,587 --> 00:22:09,928
[SPEAKER_09]: GAME, I'm not sure if it's an acronym for something, but I guess you could just call it GAME for short.

357
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:15,089
[SPEAKER_09]: A UK retailer has sent the Game Boy Micros to the bargain bin.

358
00:22:15,489 --> 00:22:18,689
[SPEAKER_09]: They used to be 69 pounds, now they're running for just 39 pounds.

359
00:22:18,709 --> 00:22:18,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Ouch.

360
00:22:21,277 --> 00:22:22,638
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

361
00:22:45,411 --> 00:22:49,892
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that there's new colors coming to Japan, actually pretty much all the regions here pretty soon.

362
00:22:49,972 --> 00:22:52,573
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that we're getting here in the U.S.

363
00:22:52,613 --> 00:22:56,654
[SPEAKER_07]: the black and pink DS lights, which are going to be coming out I think on the 20th.

364
00:23:15,339 --> 00:23:17,800
[SPEAKER_07]: and then I know in the UK they're getting the pink one as well.

365
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,762
[SPEAKER_07]: So, should be interesting with lots of different colors.

366
00:23:21,802 --> 00:23:23,303
[SPEAKER_07]: People seem to eat up that stuff.

367
00:23:25,164 --> 00:23:26,645
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just another color.

368
00:23:27,245 --> 00:23:31,267
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't understand why people are going nuts over this.

369
00:23:31,307 --> 00:23:34,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, then again, I'm going to get the pink one, I think, and let's have a change of heart.

370
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:37,870
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's just because I knew if I bought a white one, they would come out with new colors.

371
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:38,631
[SPEAKER_09]: So I waited.

372
00:23:39,431 --> 00:23:41,172
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, that's not what you're supposed to do.

373
00:23:41,192 --> 00:23:43,313
[SPEAKER_05]: You're supposed to go to EB or GameStop and

374
00:23:43,666 --> 00:24:03,412
[SPEAKER_05]: buy the system when it comes out in the color you don't want get the replacement plan then when the color does come out that you want put down the money for the reservation take your old system that you didn't like back say it didn't work then get your new color and then you still got money for your next replacement plan for the next color you want like I have

375
00:24:04,389 --> 00:24:05,770
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to get a blue one when it comes out.

376
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:07,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe, I don't know.

377
00:24:07,732 --> 00:24:08,873
[SPEAKER_09]: What if those colors don't come out?

378
00:24:08,893 --> 00:24:09,694
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to be screwed.

379
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:10,354
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have black.

380
00:24:10,374 --> 00:24:11,655
[SPEAKER_05]: That's better than the white one.

381
00:24:11,856 --> 00:24:14,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Or just pick a color and stick with it.

382
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:14,858
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

383
00:24:15,939 --> 00:24:23,185
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to go to another segment now, and it's a segment that's returning because it was so popular a couple weeks ago that we're bringing it back.

384
00:24:23,986 --> 00:24:24,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, hello.

385
00:24:25,387 --> 00:24:26,769
[SPEAKER_09]: I just picked up a call there.

386
00:24:26,949 --> 00:24:28,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, are you there on the phone?

387
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:30,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, my microphone decided to die.

388
00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:31,190
[SPEAKER_06]: It's DMN.

389
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:31,570
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up?

390
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:32,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, DMN.

391
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:32,870
[SPEAKER_09]: How you doing?

392
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,990
[SPEAKER_06]: I am doing fantastic.

393
00:24:35,031 --> 00:24:37,171
[SPEAKER_06]: I just splurged on a bunch of games.

394
00:24:37,231 --> 00:24:38,371
[SPEAKER_06]: I have Beatmania US.

395
00:24:38,391 --> 00:24:40,212
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a brand spanking new DS.

396
00:24:40,292 --> 00:24:41,152
[SPEAKER_06]: I am in a great mood.

397
00:24:41,512 --> 00:24:41,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

398
00:24:42,032 --> 00:24:43,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, you're set.

399
00:24:44,173 --> 00:24:44,513
[SPEAKER_09]: I am.

400
00:24:44,773 --> 00:24:46,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we're bringing back an old segment tonight.

401
00:24:46,793 --> 00:24:47,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, it's not that old.

402
00:24:47,593 --> 00:24:51,654
[SPEAKER_09]: We just did this for the first time a couple shows ago, and it was so friggin' popular.

403
00:24:51,694 --> 00:24:52,695
[SPEAKER_09]: We're bringing it back tonight.

404
00:24:52,755 --> 00:24:54,015
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called Beat the Host.

405
00:24:54,676 --> 00:25:01,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, DMN, you fucking always seem to get in on our Skype line, but we're okay with letting you play tonight because I know you didn't get to play last time.

406
00:25:01,658 --> 00:25:04,019
[SPEAKER_09]: So this will be the first time that you get to play this game, correct?

407
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

408
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:11,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, the prize we were going to give away tonight was another space on our MySpace Top 8, but gee, you already seem to have that.

409
00:25:11,682 --> 00:25:14,663
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll have to come up with something more creative for you, DMN, if you win tonight.

410
00:25:15,183 --> 00:25:16,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, and you know what?

411
00:25:16,624 --> 00:25:16,904
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

412
00:25:17,164 --> 00:25:18,764
[SPEAKER_06]: We're talking about Game Boy Micros.

413
00:25:18,824 --> 00:25:20,565
[SPEAKER_06]: If the host beats me, I'll give him mine.

414
00:25:21,793 --> 00:25:23,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, snap!

415
00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:25,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Something on the line tonight.

416
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:27,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that really a prize, though?

417
00:25:27,302 --> 00:25:29,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's a Game Boy Micro.

418
00:25:30,888 --> 00:25:31,188
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

419
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:31,909
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

420
00:25:31,929 --> 00:25:32,009
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

421
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:32,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Screw you.

422
00:25:32,969 --> 00:25:33,429
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll keep it.

423
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:34,430
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

424
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then you lose.

425
00:25:36,391 --> 00:25:38,352
[SPEAKER_09]: The gauntlet has been thrown, then.

426
00:25:38,392 --> 00:25:39,813
[SPEAKER_09]: This is going to be interesting tonight.

427
00:25:39,853 --> 00:25:41,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so some actual stuff.

428
00:25:41,474 --> 00:25:42,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, DMN, this is what we'll do.

429
00:25:43,435 --> 00:25:53,660
[SPEAKER_09]: We will give you the same prize we gave the last guy, and you will get to help us with our Power Preview debuts, meaning you'll be the first in the world to know about some of these new tracks whenever we get to do them.

430
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,841
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

431
00:25:55,121 --> 00:25:56,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Which hopefully should be soon.

432
00:25:56,422 --> 00:25:59,363
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so anyway, who do you want to challenge tonight and beat the host?

433
00:25:59,403 --> 00:25:59,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, first off...

434
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:06,136
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even know if I need to ask because you work for Nintendo, but how would you say your knowledge of 8-bit video game music is?

435
00:26:07,116 --> 00:26:07,957
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty decent.

436
00:26:08,097 --> 00:26:08,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty decent?

437
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:09,918
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, we'll see what happens.

438
00:26:10,139 --> 00:26:11,780
[SPEAKER_09]: He works for Nintendo?

439
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, he does.

440
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:12,800
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't know that?

441
00:26:13,121 --> 00:26:13,741
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I didn't.

442
00:26:13,921 --> 00:26:15,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I came in late.

443
00:26:15,442 --> 00:26:16,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Who do I have to choose from?

444
00:26:16,903 --> 00:26:17,784
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, here's what you do.

445
00:26:17,864 --> 00:26:21,827
[SPEAKER_09]: First, I have to boot you from the chat room because you cannot have their help tonight in this game.

446
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:22,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

447
00:26:22,867 --> 00:26:28,011
[SPEAKER_09]: You can challenge either, and don't rejoin yet, you can challenge either Miklatov or Loki tonight.

448
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, let's do it, Loki.

449
00:26:31,664 --> 00:26:33,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, let's do it, Loki.

450
00:26:58,547 --> 00:26:59,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like a plan.

451
00:26:59,288 --> 00:27:04,212
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can write him down as you go, whatever you want to do, but you only get 30 seconds to name him back, okay?

452
00:27:04,972 --> 00:27:05,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

453
00:27:05,413 --> 00:27:07,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, now, chat room, you guys can play along.

454
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:10,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Amiglatov, are you hurt that nobody ever picks you for this game?

455
00:27:10,997 --> 00:27:14,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they're stupid for not picking me because I'm really bad at this stuff.

456
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,681
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like an automatic win.

457
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:20,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, but you basically shat on the prize that DMN was going to give you, so I wouldn't have picked you either.

458
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:21,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know what?

459
00:27:21,286 --> 00:27:24,788
[SPEAKER_05]: I could have given him, I don't know, toenail clippings, and it would have been just as good.

460
00:27:25,706 --> 00:27:26,166
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

461
00:27:26,206 --> 00:27:28,708
[SPEAKER_06]: If they came with a certificate of authenticity, I'll take them.

462
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:30,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Ew.

463
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:32,411
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of gross, but you're on.

464
00:27:32,531 --> 00:27:34,893
[SPEAKER_09]: You might be able to get something like that from DDR Freak.

465
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:35,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

466
00:27:36,854 --> 00:27:37,334
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we go.

467
00:27:39,636 --> 00:27:40,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Here it is.

468
00:27:40,056 --> 00:27:40,757
[SPEAKER_09]: You ready, DMN?

469
00:27:41,237 --> 00:27:41,637
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm ready.

470
00:27:41,718 --> 00:27:42,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, here we go.

471
00:27:42,478 --> 00:27:43,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Here is the clip.

472
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:43,339
... ... ...

473
00:28:15,465 --> 00:28:16,586
Thanks for watching!

474
00:28:56,321 --> 00:28:58,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, 30 seconds to name them back.

475
00:28:58,623 --> 00:28:58,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Go.

476
00:28:59,664 --> 00:29:07,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Dragon Warrior, Excitebike, Adventure Solo, Gradient, Super Mario Bros.

477
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:19,761
[SPEAKER_06]: 2, Tetris, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2, God damn it.

478
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:22,401
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not Turtles 1.

479
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:23,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, crap.

480
00:29:24,144 --> 00:29:25,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Is somebody helping you?

481
00:29:25,887 --> 00:29:26,288
[SPEAKER_06]: No!

482
00:29:28,031 --> 00:29:28,552
[SPEAKER_09]: Five seconds.

483
00:29:29,609 --> 00:29:32,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, um, OLR, the 8-bit game.

484
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:33,270
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't fucking know anymore.

485
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, time's up.

486
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:35,110
[SPEAKER_09]: You got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

487
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:38,211
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

488
00:29:38,331 --> 00:29:39,911
[SPEAKER_09]: He would have beat me because I only got 3.

489
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:41,251
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not bad.

490
00:29:41,311 --> 00:29:42,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you don't know what the answers are yet.

491
00:29:42,952 --> 00:29:46,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I got 3 that he got, so that means they're right.

492
00:29:46,092 --> 00:29:46,513
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, fine.

493
00:29:47,053 --> 00:29:49,013
[SPEAKER_09]: You got 6, which is not a bad score.

494
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:51,574
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think you will beat Loki with this, but let's see, okay?

495
00:29:52,034 --> 00:29:53,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Miklatov, if you'd be so kind, could you go get Loki?

496
00:29:54,654 --> 00:29:58,515
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate to take you away from the Final Fantasy XI Alakazam websites.

497
00:29:59,076 --> 00:29:59,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

498
00:29:59,637 --> 00:30:00,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

499
00:30:21,527 --> 00:30:25,591
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a lot of people calling in, but now DMN is saying he didn't get any.

500
00:30:26,071 --> 00:30:27,432
[SPEAKER_09]: So you should be in good shape.

501
00:30:27,472 --> 00:30:28,073
[SPEAKER_09]: You ready, Loki?

502
00:30:28,093 --> 00:30:30,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's all right, because I probably won't get any either.

503
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:31,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Loki's intoxicated.

504
00:30:31,816 --> 00:30:34,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I'm going to write him down this time.

505
00:30:34,118 --> 00:30:35,459
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, Loki, you know how it works.

506
00:30:35,479 --> 00:30:35,820
[SPEAKER_09]: You ready?

507
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Pen and paper, the works?

508
00:30:38,081 --> 00:30:39,443
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting in the typing mode here.

509
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:39,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

510
00:30:40,263 --> 00:30:40,584
[SPEAKER_07]: You ready?

511
00:30:41,805 --> 00:30:43,466
[SPEAKER_09]: 30 seconds to name him back once it's played.

512
00:30:43,526 --> 00:30:44,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Here are your 10 songs.

513
00:30:44,867 --> 00:30:45,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Beat the host.

514
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:49,771
Oh God!

515
00:31:17,464 --> 00:31:19,685
Hey shut up, we can hear you!

516
00:31:58,661 --> 00:32:01,361
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, Loki, you have 30 seconds to name them back.

517
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:02,682
[SPEAKER_09]: On your mark, get set, go.

518
00:32:03,022 --> 00:32:04,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Friday the 13th, Tetris.

519
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:05,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, yes.

520
00:32:05,803 --> 00:32:06,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Excitebike.

521
00:32:06,603 --> 00:32:06,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

522
00:32:06,943 --> 00:32:07,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Bionic Commando.

523
00:32:07,863 --> 00:32:08,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

524
00:32:08,263 --> 00:32:09,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Mario 2.

525
00:32:09,403 --> 00:32:10,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

526
00:32:11,124 --> 00:32:13,224
[SPEAKER_07]: God, I want to say Super C. No.

527
00:32:14,045 --> 00:32:14,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Contra.

528
00:32:14,865 --> 00:32:15,085
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

529
00:32:15,465 --> 00:32:15,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn it.

530
00:32:16,765 --> 00:32:17,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck, I don't know.

531
00:32:17,585 --> 00:32:18,126
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I got.

532
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:19,006
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it?

533
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:19,546
[SPEAKER_07]: You sure?

534
00:32:19,586 --> 00:32:22,207
[SPEAKER_07]: You got 15 seconds to just randomly name games?

535
00:32:23,587 --> 00:32:23,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh...

536
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:27,476
[SPEAKER_07]: DMN got 6, The Host has been beaten!

537
00:32:50,529 --> 00:32:53,650
[SPEAKER_09]: DMN, congratulations on your fabulous prize.

538
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:56,011
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll be helping us with power previews whenever they actually happen.

539
00:32:57,031 --> 00:33:01,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, while I'm here, I should also say the Around the Horn thing has been completely scrapped.

540
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:04,735
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I will be coming in when we get the Wii.

541
00:33:05,235 --> 00:33:07,736
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be coming to the studio and giving it away live.

542
00:33:08,196 --> 00:33:08,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, crap.

543
00:33:09,477 --> 00:33:09,957
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, snap.

544
00:33:09,997 --> 00:33:11,578
[SPEAKER_09]: He's going to give away a Wii live on air.

545
00:33:11,738 --> 00:33:12,978
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to bring a bat.

546
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:17,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Or he's just going to beat up DMN because you don't like him.

547
00:33:17,648 --> 00:33:19,209
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I don't hate him at all.

548
00:33:19,629 --> 00:33:20,750
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want a free Wii.

549
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:22,751
[SPEAKER_09]: DMN, I have to know, did you have outside help?

550
00:33:22,931 --> 00:33:24,432
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I heard you talking to somebody there.

551
00:33:26,033 --> 00:33:31,717
[SPEAKER_06]: I had somebody remembering my guesses, but in all honesty, he did not give me any single answer.

552
00:33:31,977 --> 00:33:33,578
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, all right, fine, fair enough.

553
00:33:33,998 --> 00:33:36,700
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, I'm sure you guys want to know what the correct answers were.

554
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Charum did a really good job, though.

555
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,322
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they got them all, but here they are for you guys listening on the podcast that we're playing along.

556
00:33:41,623 --> 00:33:42,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you beat the host tonight?

557
00:33:42,783 --> 00:33:43,424
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's find out.

558
00:33:44,945 --> 00:33:46,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Adventures of Lolo.

559
00:33:46,405 --> 00:33:46,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Duh.

560
00:33:50,984 --> 00:33:52,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Friday the 13th.

561
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:55,506
[SPEAKER_09]: One of my favorite sleeper hits.

562
00:33:55,546 --> 00:33:58,027
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care if that game got negative reviews, it's awesome.

563
00:33:58,067 --> 00:33:58,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Tetris!

564
00:34:00,649 --> 00:34:01,569
[SPEAKER_09]: That was an easy one.

565
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:08,072
[SPEAKER_09]: River City Ransom.

566
00:34:08,412 --> 00:34:09,173
[SPEAKER_09]: God damn it.

567
00:34:10,493 --> 00:34:11,934
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the one I thought was Contra.

568
00:34:12,574 --> 00:34:14,095
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I would have thought it was the one coming up.

569
00:34:14,115 --> 00:34:16,336
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was some sort of freaking Konami game.

570
00:34:16,376 --> 00:34:16,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Excitebike!

571
00:34:17,016 --> 00:34:17,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Excitebike!

572
00:34:21,055 --> 00:34:23,435
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's like the only music in all of Excitebike is right there.

573
00:34:24,236 --> 00:34:25,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Bionic Commando.

574
00:34:25,616 --> 00:34:26,956
[SPEAKER_09]: I played this game so much.

575
00:34:27,076 --> 00:34:30,137
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the one that I completely forgot to say.

576
00:34:30,757 --> 00:34:32,577
[SPEAKER_09]: I would have thought you'd know that one, Loki.

577
00:34:32,717 --> 00:34:33,797
[SPEAKER_06]: I did.

578
00:34:33,877 --> 00:34:35,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my bad.

579
00:34:35,678 --> 00:34:36,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sorry, my bad.

580
00:34:36,318 --> 00:34:38,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Gradius, of course.

581
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:41,019
[SPEAKER_09]: Dragon Warrior.

582
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:47,700
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think either of you guys got this one.

583
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,600
[SPEAKER_09]: Double Dragons.

584
00:34:49,486 --> 00:34:50,668
[SPEAKER_09]: And lastly, you guys both got Super Mario Bros. 2.

585
00:34:55,038 --> 00:34:56,919
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm turning in my resignation to Nintendo.

586
00:34:56,939 --> 00:34:57,679
[SPEAKER_06]: That was pitiful.

587
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no, you did fine.

588
00:34:59,300 --> 00:34:59,480
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard.

589
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:03,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't do that before you give me the free Wii that I'm going to beat you up for.

590
00:35:05,323 --> 00:35:19,149
[SPEAKER_09]: No, actually, I'm thinking later on at some point during the show, we're going to have like a take-home, beat-the-host type thing that you guys will have like a week to send in the correct answers and we'll give away something big like around Christmas time.

591
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:23,131
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're going to be really fucking hard, like really fucking obscure games.

592
00:35:27,899 --> 00:35:30,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, DMN, are you proud of beating the host tonight?

593
00:35:31,061 --> 00:35:34,444
[SPEAKER_06]: I am, seeing as I jumped in the show about 20 minutes ago.

594
00:35:34,704 --> 00:35:36,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, it works.

595
00:35:36,745 --> 00:35:38,807
[SPEAKER_09]: Listening live any time, it ends up working out.

596
00:35:39,227 --> 00:35:41,289
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else you want to share with our listeners before I hang up on you?

597
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:49,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy anniversary, Jamie, and I'll see whoever's challenging me to Tetris in about 30 seconds.

598
00:35:49,334 --> 00:35:51,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, have fun with the chatroom in Tetris.

599
00:35:51,196 --> 00:35:51,636
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, take care.

600
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:52,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Later.

601
00:35:52,797 --> 00:35:52,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Later.

602
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:54,465
[SPEAKER_09]: That was fun.

603
00:35:55,806 --> 00:35:57,467
[SPEAKER_09]: I will honor the chat room's request.

604
00:35:57,547 --> 00:36:01,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Next time we do Beat the Host, we will do something maybe Sega games.

605
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:07,292
[SPEAKER_09]: I know some folks want to challenge their Sega knowledge, especially against Jamie because that girl is scary with her Sega knowledge.

606
00:36:07,792 --> 00:36:10,293
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe some other more current titles.

607
00:36:10,313 --> 00:36:12,674
[SPEAKER_09]: So that will probably be the last time we do 8-bit Nintendo for a little while.

608
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:13,755
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll see.

609
00:36:13,935 --> 00:36:18,797
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to do an all Mega Man one because there's so many different robot bosses and they all sound the same.

610
00:36:18,837 --> 00:36:20,038
[SPEAKER_09]: That might be one for the future.

611
00:36:20,078 --> 00:36:20,398
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

612
00:36:21,149 --> 00:36:26,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you saying that you would be willing to... Yeah, but if you can just name out guesses, you can just go through all the Mega Man games.

613
00:36:27,815 --> 00:36:28,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

614
00:36:28,516 --> 00:36:32,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe you'd have to actually only guess one per song.

615
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:35,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a list that you have to fill out.

616
00:36:37,031 --> 00:36:40,114
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

617
00:37:01,267 --> 00:37:29,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Some new songs were announced for Guitar Hero 2 Nirvana with Heart Shaped Box Primus with John the Fisherman Stone Temple Pilots with Trippin' on a Hole in a Paper Heart That's an amazing song Anthrax with Mouth House Motley Crue with Shout at the Devil The Police with Message in a Bottle I think that's awesome The Pretenders with Tattooed Love Boys and get this Spinal Tap with Tonight I'm Gonna Rock You Tonight That is so awesome that they got Spinal Tap in the game

618
00:37:30,609 --> 00:37:33,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's Queen and Black Hole Sun?

619
00:37:33,956 --> 00:37:35,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Black Hole Sun would be great.

620
00:37:35,178 --> 00:37:37,002
[SPEAKER_09]: Rumor is Black Hole Sun is there.

621
00:37:37,062 --> 00:37:41,792
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some really weird rumor going around on the official Guitar Hero forums that involves

622
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:45,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Like PlayStation 3 versions of the game and all this crazy shit.

623
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,020
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know.

624
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:46,561
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

625
00:37:46,661 --> 00:37:48,962
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to have to like this stupid game.

626
00:37:49,242 --> 00:37:50,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do you hate Guitar Hero so much?

627
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:51,683
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not fun.

628
00:37:51,843 --> 00:37:54,203
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have a good time with it every time I've tried it.

629
00:37:54,343 --> 00:37:55,144
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm with you, Shane.

630
00:37:55,344 --> 00:38:00,806
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like about this close to selling back my Guitar Hero and Guitar Hero controller.

631
00:38:02,507 --> 00:38:27,778
[SPEAKER_07]: but I'm almost like seeing okay maybe I should wait until this comes out I don't know because I figure I'm going to have to buy another one anyways for the 360 if it comes out so I might as well I don't know it's just now they're getting what Rush is pretty cool and getting Stone Temple Pilots makes me happy and we're running low on liquor so I'm running out boys and girls okie dokie goodbye hey

632
00:38:28,725 --> 00:38:30,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about mashed potatoes again.

633
00:38:30,986 --> 00:38:32,387
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't talk about mashed potatoes.

634
00:38:32,747 --> 00:38:33,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Dang it.

635
00:38:33,327 --> 00:38:39,290
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to talk about Best Buy and talk about Bully and talk about stupid people having too much time on their hands.

636
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:51,595
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyways, there are some oddly named protest group called the Pizzaholics that have staged a protest at a Best Buy outside of New York City.

637
00:38:53,876 --> 00:38:55,337
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently...

638
00:38:58,182 --> 00:38:58,923
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really weird.

639
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:04,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently they're just protesting the game, saying that Rockstar is worse than terrorists.

640
00:39:05,586 --> 00:39:06,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

641
00:39:06,306 --> 00:39:12,108
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really tired of people protesting a game that they don't even know what the premise of the game is.

642
00:39:13,209 --> 00:39:18,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Or just how you actually play the game and whether it actually rewards bullying.

643
00:39:18,631 --> 00:39:22,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Because to be honest, from what I've seen in the game, it doesn't look like you are the bully.

644
00:39:22,753 --> 00:39:24,274
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of like you're being bullied.

645
00:39:24,824 --> 00:39:54,297
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, that type of thing I think it was something like you start out being bullied and then you become the bully later on but it doesn't matter because all they're protesting is that little image in the corner with the R and the star there for Rockstar I'm just tired of people protesting crap protest something else how about high gas prices or something I don't know but whatever they're protesting bully for now until the next Grand Theft Auto game comes out high gas prices doesn't corrupt your kids though okay

646
00:39:55,896 --> 00:39:56,897
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, I don't know.

647
00:39:57,317 --> 00:39:57,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Should be good.

648
00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:00,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

649
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I was getting more drinks.

650
00:40:02,361 --> 00:40:03,722
[SPEAKER_09]: I brought you back more watermelon stuff.

651
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:06,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, but fuck, you didn't want more watermelon stuff, huh?

652
00:40:07,523 --> 00:40:07,923
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

653
00:40:08,023 --> 00:40:08,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever, I'm fine.

654
00:40:08,904 --> 00:40:09,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to drink it?

655
00:40:09,724 --> 00:40:10,464
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to go to waste.

656
00:40:10,484 --> 00:40:12,665
[SPEAKER_09]: There's starving children throughout the world who might want that drink.

657
00:40:13,126 --> 00:40:16,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm not sure how much more I really want to drink this.

658
00:40:16,367 --> 00:40:17,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want a straight?

659
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:17,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want the screwdriver?

660
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:18,988
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I do not want the screwdriver.

661
00:40:19,248 --> 00:40:19,789
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel bad.

662
00:40:19,809 --> 00:40:21,049
[SPEAKER_07]: I will drink the watermelon stuff.

663
00:40:21,069 --> 00:40:27,652
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just that cup that you have it in was, I think, originally a candy dish, and it is like an over... It's been washed.

664
00:40:28,232 --> 00:40:31,034
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's been washed, but it's an oversized mug.

665
00:40:31,094 --> 00:40:33,275
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like fucking huge is what it is.

666
00:40:33,295 --> 00:40:33,935
[SPEAKER_09]: It's fine.

667
00:40:35,202 --> 00:40:35,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Drink gets you a big wimp.

668
00:40:36,303 --> 00:40:37,724
[SPEAKER_09]: Am I up?

669
00:40:38,044 --> 00:40:38,944
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it my turn for a story?

670
00:40:39,465 --> 00:40:40,085
[SPEAKER_09]: It is your turn.

671
00:40:40,225 --> 00:40:40,465
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

672
00:40:40,586 --> 00:40:41,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it the bully name change?

673
00:40:41,946 --> 00:40:42,727
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys didn't do that yet?

674
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:43,207
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we haven't.

675
00:40:43,227 --> 00:40:43,647
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, good.

676
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:46,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Then bully is getting a name change, but only in other countries.

677
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:48,811
[SPEAKER_09]: And you just talked about bully, yes, Loki?

678
00:40:48,911 --> 00:40:49,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I did.

679
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:50,392
[SPEAKER_09]: And the protests.

680
00:40:50,492 --> 00:40:52,093
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you see the YouTube thing?

681
00:40:52,637 --> 00:40:53,518
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

682
00:41:14,218 --> 00:41:17,600
[SPEAKER_09]: but maybe because Rockstar is a little bit afraid of all the controversy?

683
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:24,324
[SPEAKER_09]: That might be a really good thing to do here is just kind of swap the name around and then people will go, I had no idea what you were talking about.

684
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:27,466
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, Rockstar is kind of pussying out, I think.

685
00:41:28,127 --> 00:41:29,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I agree.

686
00:41:29,468 --> 00:41:34,391
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think they will change it here in America and I don't think that may be the reason they changed it in Europe.

687
00:41:34,911 --> 00:41:38,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe, you know, they do name changes all the time with games in Europe for weird reasons.

688
00:41:38,453 --> 00:41:39,174
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a big deal.

689
00:41:39,778 --> 00:41:41,299
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a pretty dumb name for the game.

690
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:42,660
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like that game either.

691
00:41:43,361 --> 00:41:46,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, there's some interesting news about Resident Evil for the Wii.

692
00:41:47,604 --> 00:41:52,608
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually coming from Tara Platt, who is the voice actress for Jill Valentine.

693
00:41:52,668 --> 00:42:01,015
[SPEAKER_07]: She confirmed that the game will feature zombies, or zombie-like enemies, and plant creatures, as well as a wide variety of weaponry.

694
00:42:01,676 --> 00:42:09,382
[SPEAKER_07]: The fact that Mrs. Platt was aware of the weapons in the game infers that she's voicing a playable character and not just doing

695
00:42:09,898 --> 00:42:10,499
[SPEAKER_07]: A cameo.

696
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:17,064
[SPEAKER_07]: It says Jill being the main character increases likelihood of seeing Carlos and Barry turn up as well.

697
00:42:17,664 --> 00:42:19,305
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be kind of interesting.

698
00:42:19,325 --> 00:42:20,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe they're remaking the first one or something.

699
00:42:21,127 --> 00:42:22,027
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

700
00:42:23,068 --> 00:42:24,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully it's not a gun survivor game.

701
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:27,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Because those kind of suck.

702
00:42:28,773 --> 00:42:30,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you looking forward to Resident Evil on the Wii?

703
00:42:31,235 --> 00:42:33,296
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess.

704
00:42:33,857 --> 00:42:36,679
[SPEAKER_07]: I found something else funny.

705
00:42:36,819 --> 00:42:37,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Because apparently...

706
00:42:40,464 --> 00:42:41,865
[SPEAKER_07]: She sent them an email.

707
00:42:42,505 --> 00:42:44,046
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this is coming from Kotaku here.

708
00:42:44,426 --> 00:42:54,792
[SPEAKER_07]: I sent them an email about saying that she's not allowed to verify information about Biohazard 5 or Resident Evil 5 in Japan or in the Wii game.

709
00:42:55,653 --> 00:42:56,253
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of funny.

710
00:42:57,354 --> 00:42:59,975
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, oops, I slipped and then I take it all back.

711
00:43:02,177 --> 00:43:02,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

712
00:43:02,517 --> 00:43:03,518
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

713
00:43:04,437 --> 00:43:09,561
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a quick story for you guys here regarding, also on the Wii, The Legend of Zelda.

714
00:43:10,342 --> 00:43:16,107
[SPEAKER_09]: And in a little, tiny little blip that IGN wrote earlier this week, they dropped an interesting little tidbit.

715
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:26,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Twilight Princess will not only be bigger, a horse ride from one side of Hyrule to the next is rumored to take 45 real minutes to get from one side of the world to the other on a horse.

716
00:43:26,936 --> 00:43:30,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, that's nothing compared to a chocobo ride around Final Fantasy XI, but

717
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:32,901
[SPEAKER_09]: That's very true.

718
00:43:33,201 --> 00:43:34,782
[SPEAKER_09]: MMOs are supposed to be big, though.

719
00:43:34,822 --> 00:43:36,643
[SPEAKER_09]: That's still pretty impressive, you've got to admit.

720
00:43:37,244 --> 00:43:40,546
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to imagine how long it's going to take you to walk, then, from the other side.

721
00:43:40,566 --> 00:43:42,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Horse will significantly increase the speed.

722
00:43:42,467 --> 00:43:46,911
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thinking, obviously, at some point you'll be able to play an ocarina and be able to warp around.

723
00:43:47,131 --> 00:43:49,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do you think you have an ocarina?

724
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:50,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you have to, it's Zelda.

725
00:43:50,653 --> 00:43:52,274
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they don't always have ocarinas.

726
00:43:52,314 --> 00:43:54,296
[SPEAKER_09]: They could have something else, a flute, something.

727
00:43:54,336 --> 00:44:00,820
[SPEAKER_09]: You know there's going to be a tornado that will wish you away, because they're not going to expect people to actually use 45 minutes to run from one side unless they're exploring.

728
00:44:01,021 --> 00:44:01,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Or do they?

729
00:44:02,332 --> 00:44:03,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they'd be stupid if they did.

730
00:44:04,233 --> 00:44:08,014
[SPEAKER_05]: They made you do that crap in... What's that game?

731
00:44:08,054 --> 00:44:08,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Wind Waker.

732
00:44:08,594 --> 00:44:13,255
[SPEAKER_05]: We had to go and find the Triforce pieces and that was hours upon hours of pain.

733
00:44:13,435 --> 00:44:20,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Wind Waker was a little bit lame compared to the other Zeldas and that other god-awful 64 one.

734
00:44:21,238 --> 00:44:22,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Majora's Mask.

735
00:44:22,738 --> 00:44:23,619
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't even get me started.

736
00:44:23,879 --> 00:44:25,719
[SPEAKER_07]: To be honest, I kind of liked Wind Waker.

737
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:26,960
[SPEAKER_09]: It's okay.

738
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:27,380
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

739
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,060
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have rather seen that kind of

740
00:44:31,997 --> 00:44:48,859
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess, not Link's Awakening, but I don't know, one of the older Zelda's done kind of the same style as Wind Waker, but actually be for the GameCube in fully 3D and not for the DS with Wind Waker graphics type of crap.

741
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:50,321
[SPEAKER_07]: So, anyways.

742
00:44:51,024 --> 00:44:56,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, speaking of stuff that's kind of crappy, live ads coming to video games.

743
00:44:56,526 --> 00:44:57,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that's right.

744
00:44:57,446 --> 00:45:09,331
[SPEAKER_07]: EA has signed a deal with two ad companies that will stream live advertisement into the brand new Need for Speed Carbon and, of course, the upcoming PC and probably next-gen game, Battlefield 2142.

745
00:45:12,932 --> 00:45:15,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Quite interesting that they're doing this.

746
00:45:15,214 --> 00:45:24,360
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they've also kind of run into a lot of controversy with, you know, gathering information about their users and whatnot for God knows what reasons.

747
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:27,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe now they're going to be gathering information about their users to advertise to them.

748
00:45:28,683 --> 00:45:29,044
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

749
00:45:29,344 --> 00:45:33,907
[SPEAKER_07]: I think if I pay for a game, then why the fuck do I got to see advertisements in the game as well?

750
00:45:34,268 --> 00:45:40,292
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's going to be kind of stupid when I'm playing around Battlefield 21, you know, 42, and all of a sudden there's a Toyota Yaris...

751
00:45:41,065 --> 00:45:43,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Funnydale says Orange Launch Radio needs to have ads in Saints Row

752
00:46:12,617 --> 00:46:13,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that'd be cool.

753
00:46:13,598 --> 00:46:14,078
[SPEAKER_09]: So what do you think?

754
00:46:14,098 --> 00:46:16,299
[SPEAKER_09]: You think this is the end of video games as we know it, or what?

755
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:19,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's not the end, because, you know, I can ignore them just as easily as I ignore everything else.

756
00:46:20,261 --> 00:46:25,584
[SPEAKER_07]: At least they're not having, like, the Bird King King coming out and fucking, you know, walking around.

757
00:46:25,604 --> 00:46:26,304
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be awesome.

758
00:46:26,624 --> 00:46:34,608
[SPEAKER_07]: I still think, though, they should have made him a playable character in Fight Night Round 3, because that would have been fucking... I would have bought the game for... I would have bought Fight Night Round 3 just for that, too.

759
00:46:34,649 --> 00:46:35,169
[SPEAKER_09]: Just for that.

760
00:46:36,242 --> 00:46:38,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Just put the Muppets into the Fight Night engine, that would be awesome.

761
00:46:39,265 --> 00:46:59,541
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I gotta say, Rumble Roses, okay, true, that game was kind of shitty, but it was hilarious watching, I mean, getting to play the women beating up on each other was so funny, because, like, you know, I was able to give running commentary on the game, and I was just going like, ow, you just got kicked in the vagina, ow, you just got kicked in the vagina, and it was really funny, wasn't it, Miklatov?

762
00:47:00,709 --> 00:47:05,710
[SPEAKER_05]: No, because I had to work on that game and I don't find anything about that game funny anymore because it's obnoxious and annoying.

763
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:07,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you tell us what you did on the game or is that secret?

764
00:47:07,831 --> 00:47:11,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you rather play Bomberman Act Zero or Rumble Roses XX?

765
00:47:11,932 --> 00:47:13,272
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd rather have my hands cut off.

766
00:47:15,012 --> 00:47:16,133
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I just worked on text.

767
00:47:16,193 --> 00:47:22,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you rather play Rumble Roses XX or not have a new sweet coding game ever again?

768
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:30,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Um... If it ended on 5, that wouldn't be terrible, but... Alright, look.

769
00:47:31,876 --> 00:47:33,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else you want to say on this topic, Loki?

770
00:47:34,378 --> 00:47:36,960
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I gotta play through that damn game to get the achievements.

771
00:47:37,501 --> 00:47:38,342
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't want to.

772
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:40,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Our Skype line is open.

773
00:47:40,444 --> 00:47:41,184

783
00:48:03,333 --> 00:48:04,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

784
00:48:04,434 --> 00:48:04,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

785
00:48:05,734 --> 00:48:06,494
[SPEAKER_12]: Raven Stolfen.

786
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:07,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Raven Stolfen.

787
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:08,335
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind, buddy?

788
00:48:09,555 --> 00:48:11,395
[SPEAKER_12]: The PSP thing and the DS.

789
00:48:11,895 --> 00:48:12,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-huh.

790
00:48:13,176 --> 00:48:16,697
[SPEAKER_12]: You speak on it very briefly and you said, what is wrong with porn?

791
00:48:17,117 --> 00:48:18,077
[SPEAKER_12]: I enjoy porn.

792
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:19,701
[SPEAKER_12]: Grand Theft Auto.

793
00:48:20,181 --> 00:48:21,702
[SPEAKER_12]: I enjoy Super Mario Kart.

794
00:48:24,104 --> 00:48:29,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, so there's no need for a PSP versus DS war.

795
00:48:29,788 --> 00:48:30,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't we all just get along?

796
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:33,211
[SPEAKER_12]: That's pretty much what I'm saying.

797
00:48:34,071 --> 00:48:35,372
[SPEAKER_12]: Everyone should just get along.

798
00:48:35,813 --> 00:48:40,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, what do you think the PSP's strengths are and what do you think the DS's strengths are?

799
00:48:41,657 --> 00:48:46,841
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I think the PSP's strengths are it's in the video games and video.

800
00:48:47,301 --> 00:48:48,302
[SPEAKER_12]: That's where the strength is.

801
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:51,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

802
00:48:52,742 --> 00:49:08,236
[SPEAKER_12]: And it really does well with that, and the DS is, you know, DS is good for, like, porting games, right, with the touchscreen, and that's what the Wii is gonna be like, it's gonna be like touchscreen, I mean, not touchscreen, I mean with... A different way of interacting with the game.

803
00:49:09,617 --> 00:49:09,957
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

804
00:49:10,678 --> 00:49:17,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, who knows, there are rumors that the DS could be used as a controller on the Wii, much like you could use a Game Boy Advance on the GameCube with that special little hookup.

805
00:49:18,303 --> 00:49:20,484
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe there will be touchscreen Wii games in the future.

806
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:20,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows?

807
00:49:22,184 --> 00:49:26,706
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas the PSP, you can only use as your rear-view mirror on the PlayStation 3.

808
00:49:28,026 --> 00:49:28,966
[SPEAKER_09]: That was funny, though.

809
00:49:29,646 --> 00:49:31,707
[SPEAKER_09]: No, in all seriousness, that is a pretty cool feature.

810
00:49:31,847 --> 00:49:32,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Expensive, but good.

811
00:49:33,988 --> 00:49:35,788
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I think of PSP a lot.

812
00:49:35,828 --> 00:49:44,931
[SPEAKER_12]: Wouldn't you think if the PSP didn't come along that they'll be like ports of Nintendo 64 games a lot more expensive?

813
00:49:47,194 --> 00:49:49,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, run that by me again, because you're kind of cutting out a little bit.

814
00:49:50,915 --> 00:49:51,795
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, okay.

815
00:49:52,915 --> 00:50:00,157
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, if the PSP didn't come along, the Nintendo 64, of course, would be on the Nintendo DS.

816
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:04,977
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, that's kind of what the Nintendo DS feels like to me, is the Nintendo 64 with touchscreen graphics.

817
00:50:06,078 --> 00:50:10,058
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but if the PSP didn't come along, that would be like... Okay.

818
00:50:10,078 --> 00:50:10,238
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

819
00:50:15,186 --> 00:50:18,127
[SPEAKER_12]: and I thank PSP for that and for its innovation.

820
00:50:18,487 --> 00:50:18,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

821
00:50:19,188 --> 00:50:19,608
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotcha.

822
00:50:19,648 --> 00:50:21,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners?

823
00:50:22,349 --> 00:50:23,950
[SPEAKER_12]: My internet sucks tonight, Sky.

824
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:25,670
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why I'm calling on my cell phone.

825
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:26,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

826
00:50:26,751 --> 00:50:27,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's a cell phone.

827
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:30,392
[SPEAKER_09]: That answers the lie because it's a little bit fuzzy but that's alright.

828
00:50:30,752 --> 00:50:32,193
[SPEAKER_09]: We appreciate the phone call nevertheless.

829
00:50:33,473 --> 00:50:33,714
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

830
00:50:33,734 --> 00:50:34,394
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Sky.

831
00:50:34,514 --> 00:50:35,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good week, my friend.

832
00:50:36,295 --> 00:50:36,575
[SPEAKER_09]: You too.

833
00:50:36,595 --> 00:50:36,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

834
00:50:36,675 --> 00:50:37,335
[SPEAKER_09]: Until next time.

835
00:50:38,496 --> 00:50:39,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to the phones.

836
00:50:39,817 --> 00:50:42,358
[SPEAKER_09]: OrangeLaunchRadio.com, click on Interact With Us, or 916-226-9067.

837
00:50:42,618 --> 00:50:45,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Whoa, shit.

838
00:50:45,439 --> 00:50:46,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

839
00:50:46,519 --> 00:50:46,939
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

840
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,480
[SPEAKER_00]: Legend of Zaku.

841
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:49,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, my friend.

842
00:50:49,601 --> 00:50:50,401
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind, buddy?

843
00:50:51,421 --> 00:51:02,986
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, why is everyone getting their panties in a bunch about Bully, especially groups that think they know a lot about the game, yet they're protesting misinformation?

844
00:51:03,206 --> 00:51:07,328
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's teaching the youth of America how to smoke, crack, and worship Satan.

845
00:51:08,326 --> 00:51:11,727
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, Billy's teaching him about the right thing to do, fighting back.

846
00:51:12,487 --> 00:51:13,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, now, wait a minute.

847
00:51:13,368 --> 00:51:15,749
[SPEAKER_09]: That's debatable.

848
00:51:15,809 --> 00:51:18,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, every family can choose.

849
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:21,271
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get pumped around, you fight back.

850
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,351
[SPEAKER_09]: My parents didn't choose to raise me that way.

851
00:51:23,391 --> 00:51:25,432
[SPEAKER_09]: They didn't choose to raise me to fight back.

852
00:51:25,892 --> 00:51:27,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Did they raise you to use your words?

853
00:51:27,713 --> 00:51:30,994
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they raised me to go run and tell the principal and then sue him.

854
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:32,321
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

855
00:51:32,441 --> 00:51:33,143
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm just kidding.

856
00:51:33,343 --> 00:51:34,164
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just kidding.

857
00:51:34,505 --> 00:51:35,747
[SPEAKER_09]: But something along those lines.

858
00:51:35,787 --> 00:51:37,130
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't fight violence with violence.

859
00:51:37,631 --> 00:51:38,492
[SPEAKER_09]: Not in my household.

860
00:51:38,793 --> 00:51:44,183
[SPEAKER_00]: I sort of suspect that the pieces of comics are being manipulated by, you know, he who cannot be named.

861
00:51:44,223 --> 00:51:44,464
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

862
00:51:45,491 --> 00:51:50,015
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, well, needless to say, it's up to a parent how they want to raise their kids or whatever.

863
00:51:50,095 --> 00:51:50,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Fine.

864
00:51:51,716 --> 00:51:57,380
[SPEAKER_09]: And it should also be up to a parent how they want or what games they want their kids... Sorry, I've been drinking a little bit.

865
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,942
[SPEAKER_09]: It's also up to a parent... That's fine.

866
00:52:01,023 --> 00:52:02,184
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you're slurring too a little bit.

867
00:52:02,584 --> 00:52:04,645
[SPEAKER_09]: It's up to a parent... Shut up!

868
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:05,226
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think!

869
00:52:05,886 --> 00:52:10,189
[SPEAKER_09]: It's also up to a parent how... God damn it.

870
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:13,392
[SPEAKER_09]: It's up to a parent what games they want their kids to play, right?

871
00:52:14,915 --> 00:52:15,556
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's true.

872
00:52:15,676 --> 00:52:17,418
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my point.

873
00:52:17,758 --> 00:52:32,374
[SPEAKER_00]: They ultimately control what the kid actually plays, and that's where all the responsibility falls, not the government, not the right of the government to tell us how to live our lives to an extent.

874
00:52:33,596 --> 00:52:39,859
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, murder, stealing, and all that other stuff has to be regulated, but... Okay, well, now, wait a minute.

875
00:52:39,879 --> 00:52:41,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, here's another question for you.

876
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,040
[SPEAKER_09]: What about freedom of speech?

877
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:45,922
[SPEAKER_09]: These guys have a right... These guys have a right... Well, I'm defending these guys a little bit.

878
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:46,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Just be a devil's advocate.

879
00:52:47,103 --> 00:52:52,526
[SPEAKER_09]: These guys have a right to protest just as we have the right to get on internet radio and call them stupid heads.

880
00:52:53,846 --> 00:52:57,147
[SPEAKER_00]: I respect that right, but I also have the right to criticize.

881
00:52:57,327 --> 00:53:00,987
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to be very constructive in that I'm pointing out their fallacies.

882
00:53:01,047 --> 00:53:09,389
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the fact that they're saying that the FCC regulates the whole content rating, which actually the ESRB does.

883
00:53:10,689 --> 00:53:15,570
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that they're saying that Rockstar is a bunch of terrorists, that's just blown out of proportion.

884
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:19,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I can agree with that.

885
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:22,411
[SPEAKER_09]: What could these guys do better if they wouldn't get their point across?

886
00:53:23,041 --> 00:53:26,343
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, they need to play the game and then criticize.

887
00:53:26,363 --> 00:53:30,425
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't criticize something that you don't know or haven't seen or haven't experienced.

888
00:53:30,985 --> 00:53:34,347
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what people, you know, it's been done already in the past.

889
00:53:34,427 --> 00:53:41,891
[SPEAKER_00]: People have jumped the gun too quickly without knowing the whole side of the story and they just made up their mind already.

890
00:53:42,091 --> 00:53:42,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you know what, guys?

891
00:53:42,992 --> 00:53:44,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Halo 3 fucking sucks.

892
00:53:45,033 --> 00:53:48,195
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate to tell you, but it's going to be the biggest letdown of the year.

893
00:53:49,096 --> 00:53:50,177
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a horrible game.

894
00:53:50,297 --> 00:53:53,779
[SPEAKER_00]: Live is so buggy, you guys, you wouldn't even believe.

895
00:53:53,799 --> 00:54:00,725
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it's just, you know, those people make up their mind without hearing the other side of the story.

896
00:54:00,765 --> 00:54:01,465
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fools.

897
00:54:02,146 --> 00:54:03,347
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just literally fools.

898
00:54:03,547 --> 00:54:14,775
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not that smart to actually, you know, they don't have the guts to actually experience the other side of the story and then make up their mind and what they want to stand for.

899
00:54:14,975 --> 00:54:17,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, any other words you have for our listeners tonight?

900
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:19,291
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty much it.

901
00:54:19,351 --> 00:54:21,653
[SPEAKER_00]: And just, you know, don't drink in 2DX.

902
00:54:22,534 --> 00:54:23,354
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I won't.

903
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:25,016
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.

904
00:54:25,076 --> 00:54:25,556
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, man.

905
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:30,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't drink in 2DX, okay?

906
00:54:33,102 --> 00:54:35,744
[SPEAKER_09]: The chatroom's yelling at me over that Halo 3 comment.

907
00:54:35,764 --> 00:54:37,205
[SPEAKER_09]: I was kidding, you guys.

908
00:54:37,505 --> 00:54:38,646
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a joke, in a way.

909
00:54:38,986 --> 00:54:40,367
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a bad joke, but it was a joke.

910
00:54:41,188 --> 00:54:42,109
[SPEAKER_09]: If that makes any sense at all.

911
00:54:42,618 --> 00:54:45,000
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll take one more call if anybody actually wants to call us.

912
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,782
[SPEAKER_09]: Area code 916-226-9067.

913
00:54:47,842 --> 00:54:49,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember, kids, that may be a toll call.

914
00:54:49,723 --> 00:54:52,905
[SPEAKER_09]: We are too cheap to get an 800 number, or at least Skype doesn't offer them yet.

915
00:54:53,505 --> 00:54:55,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Or you can Skype us, username OrangeLoungeRadio.

916
00:54:55,607 --> 00:54:57,188
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm noticing the phones are a little dead tonight.

917
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:58,489
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little weird for us.

918
00:54:59,249 --> 00:55:01,351
[SPEAKER_09]: We usually have, like, tons of people calling in, but not tonight.

919
00:55:01,371 --> 00:55:02,191
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a three-day weekend.

920
00:55:02,231 --> 00:55:04,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone is kind of on vacation.

921
00:55:05,013 --> 00:55:07,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Out drinking at their local Labor Day barbecues.

922
00:55:07,895 --> 00:55:09,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know what was going on?

923
00:55:09,937 --> 00:55:10,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know what...

924
00:55:11,269 --> 00:55:11,849
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I don't know.

925
00:55:11,889 --> 00:55:15,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know what was going on in town here locally tonight?

926
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:15,890
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

927
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:19,511
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm here at this show instead of being at this event.

928
00:55:20,351 --> 00:55:23,111
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a big gay pride fest going on downtown.

929
00:55:24,452 --> 00:55:26,912
[SPEAKER_09]: They have Riken from The Amazing Race.

930
00:55:27,012 --> 00:55:27,732
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you love him.

931
00:55:28,312 --> 00:55:30,493
[SPEAKER_09]: And probably his boyfriend Lance Bass is there too.

932
00:55:31,613 --> 00:55:35,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Tiffany and Debbie Gibson on the same stage.

933
00:55:35,114 --> 00:55:36,194
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds terrible.

934
00:55:37,998 --> 00:55:40,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but you're a homophobic gay man.

935
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,462
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true, but still terrible.

936
00:55:41,602 --> 00:55:43,304
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how I describe you to all my friends, Shane.

937
00:55:43,324 --> 00:55:44,345
[SPEAKER_09]: You're a homophobic gay man.

938
00:55:44,705 --> 00:55:45,006
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

939
00:55:45,206 --> 00:55:45,486
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

940
00:55:45,907 --> 00:55:47,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

941
00:55:47,188 --> 00:55:48,970
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's better, Tiffany or Debbie Gibson?

942
00:55:49,771 --> 00:55:50,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, me.

943
00:55:51,192 --> 00:55:51,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, who's me?

944
00:55:52,934 --> 00:55:54,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, me is Drunami.

945
00:55:54,115 --> 00:55:56,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Drunami, you didn't sing Electric Youth, okay?

946
00:55:57,362 --> 00:55:58,723
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't drink anymore.

947
00:56:24,332 --> 00:56:26,833
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we have to respect his right to be sober.

948
00:56:26,893 --> 00:56:27,293
[SPEAKER_09]: It's fine.

949
00:56:27,313 --> 00:56:29,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but we don't have to like it.

950
00:56:29,614 --> 00:56:32,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody has to drive you to life after the show.

951
00:56:32,314 --> 00:56:33,495
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying it to piss you off.

952
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,115
[SPEAKER_08]: You do know that.

953
00:56:34,155 --> 00:56:35,816
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't even fucking played Sucor.

954
00:56:36,996 --> 00:56:38,576
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, this is just like last time.

955
00:56:38,596 --> 00:56:40,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you call in to say anything intelligent?

956
00:56:41,017 --> 00:56:42,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Or did you just come on to fuck up the show?

957
00:56:42,978 --> 00:56:43,818
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I want to know.

958
00:56:44,118 --> 00:56:45,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm calling in to fuck up the show.

959
00:56:46,499 --> 00:56:48,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I'm hanging up on you, bitch!

960
00:56:48,099 --> 00:56:49,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless you have something intelligent to say.

961
00:56:50,541 --> 00:56:53,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, uh, next time we do Beat the Hosts, I am so in.

962
00:56:53,963 --> 00:56:54,684
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care!

963
00:56:56,865 --> 00:56:58,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

964
00:56:59,587 --> 00:57:00,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, this is Nintendo Maniac 64.

965
00:57:01,609 --> 00:57:03,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Nintendo Maniac 64, what's on your mind?

966
00:57:04,631 --> 00:57:08,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Um... I just berated the last caller, so I'm in an angry mode.

967
00:57:08,393 --> 00:57:10,435
[SPEAKER_09]: So you better have something good to say, what's on your mind?

968
00:57:11,175 --> 00:57:15,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is just a simple question, and I sent in... Okay, I can do questions.

969
00:57:15,678 --> 00:57:16,378
[SPEAKER_02]: ...but nobody read it.

970
00:57:17,259 --> 00:57:19,400
[SPEAKER_09]: We might have read it, we just ignored it for now.

971
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:20,981
[SPEAKER_09]: We might get into it next week.

972
00:57:22,102 --> 00:57:24,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I guess we'll do your question, since you have a question.

973
00:57:25,324 --> 00:57:26,464
[SPEAKER_09]: What is your question?

974
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:33,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I remember something about last year, where you mentioned something about an Ogvorbis stream.

975
00:57:33,849 --> 00:57:34,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Did that ever exist?

976
00:57:34,989 --> 00:57:35,390
[SPEAKER_02]: A what?

977
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:37,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Like an Ogvorbis stream?

978
00:57:38,443 --> 00:57:48,149
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, um, you know, okay, that would involve us getting off of Live 365, which right now, um, we have other options we're pursuing is all I can say right now.

979
00:57:48,289 --> 00:57:51,031
[SPEAKER_09]: So, oh, the OGG stream is a little bit on hold.

980
00:57:51,071 --> 00:57:52,752
[SPEAKER_09]: It was something we were exploring previously.

981
00:57:53,072 --> 00:57:58,795
[SPEAKER_09]: We do know it would give a little bit of a better sound than MP3 Pro, but, uh, um, we're just not going to do it at this time.

982
00:57:58,935 --> 00:57:59,155
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

983
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:00,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there something you want to say about OGG?

984
00:58:00,516 --> 00:58:05,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's just that I thought of it, and I'm like, wait, I know he said something about Augs Vorbis.

985
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:07,110
[SPEAKER_02]: but I had no idea what.

986
00:58:07,451 --> 00:58:10,353
[SPEAKER_02]: So, okay, so it was supposed to be like a future idea or something?

987
00:58:10,593 --> 00:58:15,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, yes, but we have another future idea that's taking precedence and that's all I can say at this time.

988
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:17,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Lame.

989
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:18,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

990
00:58:18,521 --> 00:58:20,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have any comments on tonight's stories otherwise?

991
00:58:21,183 --> 00:58:21,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, let's see.

992
00:58:22,324 --> 00:58:23,645
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

993
00:58:25,026 --> 00:58:28,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh... Okay, I'm bored.

994
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:29,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, let's go...

995
00:58:32,446 --> 00:58:35,567
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to drink more often because I get mean angry jokes.

996
00:58:36,707 --> 00:58:37,307
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

997
00:58:37,467 --> 00:58:38,968
[SPEAKER_09]: I do love the callers.

998
00:58:39,788 --> 00:58:40,608
[SPEAKER_09]: I really do.

999
00:58:43,869 --> 00:58:47,890
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is what every iTunes reviewer has always wanted us to do to the calls.

1000
00:58:48,431 --> 00:58:49,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1001
00:58:49,591 --> 00:58:49,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

1002
00:58:51,311 --> 00:58:52,312
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, this is Jaded.

1003
00:58:52,752 --> 00:58:53,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Jaded.

1004
00:58:53,352 --> 00:58:54,172
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1005
00:58:54,192 --> 00:58:56,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep in mind I'm in a bad mood, so make it good.

1006
00:58:58,713 --> 00:58:59,514
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, nothing much.

1007
00:58:59,534 --> 00:59:00,034
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just...

1008
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:04,791
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just reading all these DS reviews, I guess you could say.

1009
00:59:06,132 --> 00:59:06,492
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up?

1010
00:59:06,752 --> 00:59:07,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Like what DS reviews?

1011
00:59:08,833 --> 00:59:09,833
[SPEAKER_11]: Pardon me?

1012
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:11,293
[SPEAKER_09]: You say DS reviews?

1013
00:59:12,454 --> 00:59:13,634
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, DS reviews.

1014
00:59:13,834 --> 00:59:16,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, what's on your mind with the DS reviews?

1015
00:59:16,335 --> 00:59:21,437
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, all these new products, or actually all these full products that I saw for the DS.

1016
00:59:21,537 --> 00:59:23,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, who's writing the DS reviews?

1017
00:59:23,157 --> 00:59:25,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I want to know if I value their opinion or not.

1018
00:59:27,364 --> 00:59:28,765
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, they're not reviews.

1019
00:59:28,805 --> 00:59:32,087
[SPEAKER_11]: They're just products that I think are pretty cool for the DS.

1020
00:59:32,187 --> 00:59:33,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, what are they?

1021
00:59:34,528 --> 00:59:37,930
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I found the DS Rumble Pack.

1022
00:59:39,711 --> 00:59:42,392
[SPEAKER_11]: I also found the DS TV Tuner.

1023
00:59:44,173 --> 00:59:46,895
[SPEAKER_11]: I also found the DS Memory Expansion.

1024
00:59:47,035 --> 00:59:48,335
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this a website or something?

1025
00:59:50,036 --> 00:59:54,058
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I just have a friend that's looking up random DS things.

1026
00:59:54,939 --> 00:59:55,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1027
00:59:55,646 --> 00:59:56,967
[SPEAKER_09]: What, are you going to buy these, or what?

1028
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:00,831
[SPEAKER_11]: He's thinking about it, actually.

1029
01:00:01,071 --> 01:00:01,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1030
01:00:04,654 --> 01:00:08,578
[SPEAKER_11]: On top of that, about your game, Beat the Host.

1031
01:00:09,018 --> 01:00:09,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1032
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:10,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Beat the Host.

1033
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:11,801
[SPEAKER_09]: We love Beat the Host.

1034
01:00:12,702 --> 01:00:12,982
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1035
01:00:13,462 --> 01:00:16,225
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to get into some really odd boss stuff.

1036
01:00:16,929 --> 01:00:19,011
[SPEAKER_11]: How about you do stuff from the Atari era?

1037
01:00:19,251 --> 01:00:19,751
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, look.

1038
01:00:20,412 --> 01:00:25,036
[SPEAKER_09]: If you say it though, then everybody's prepared for it so it's not so offbeat.

1039
01:00:25,576 --> 01:00:26,077
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

1040
01:00:26,397 --> 01:00:26,617
[SPEAKER_09]: True.

1041
01:00:27,018 --> 01:00:30,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I do like the idea of Atari 2600 stuff, but here's the problem.

1042
01:00:30,661 --> 01:00:37,386
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of the folks that listen to our program are like 17 and weren't even a sperm yet when Atari 2600 was out.

1043
01:00:40,979 --> 01:00:41,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

1044
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:42,260
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know.

1045
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:45,403
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I guess we could, but I don't know.

1046
01:00:45,943 --> 01:00:47,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you do an Atari 2600 beat the host?

1047
01:00:48,765 --> 01:00:49,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

1048
01:00:49,346 --> 01:00:51,547
[SPEAKER_09]: I would probably get less right.

1049
01:00:51,988 --> 01:00:54,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's the thing is a lot of Atari 2600 games didn't have music.

1050
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:57,012
[SPEAKER_09]: We will take it under consideration for the future.

1051
01:00:57,712 --> 01:00:58,193
[SPEAKER_09]: How does that sound?

1052
01:00:59,213 --> 01:00:59,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Pardon?

1053
01:01:00,134 --> 01:01:03,577
[SPEAKER_09]: We will take it under consideration for the future.

1054
01:01:03,637 --> 01:01:04,317
[SPEAKER_09]: How does that sound?

1055
01:01:05,398 --> 01:01:06,539
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that would sound pretty good.

1056
01:01:06,639 --> 01:01:06,959
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1057
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:10,162
[SPEAKER_11]: The Atari 2600 games did have music.

1058
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:12,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, also you're forgetting the Atari 7800.

1059
01:01:31,556 --> 01:01:43,141
[SPEAKER_09]: The Atari 800, the Atari 400 Wait, okay, now you're just getting crazy Because not that many people played those systems I mean, we could, I guess But then why don't I throw in VIC-20 games while we're at it?

1060
01:01:43,181 --> 01:01:56,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on Okay, that would be a pretty good idea You need to throw in those Tiger Electronics Okay, but that's assuming that the host would be able to get any points at all We don't want to embarrass ourselves through this game

1061
01:01:58,104 --> 01:02:00,366
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to cover all genres of games.

1062
01:02:00,486 --> 01:02:01,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we'll think about it.

1063
01:02:01,587 --> 01:02:03,829
[SPEAKER_09]: We're taking all your suggestions under consideration.

1064
01:02:03,869 --> 01:02:04,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for your feedback.

1065
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:06,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else you want to share with the listeners?

1066
01:02:07,152 --> 01:02:07,673
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, no.

1067
01:02:08,133 --> 01:02:09,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, then that's it.

1068
01:02:10,135 --> 01:02:13,078
[SPEAKER_09]: You're so mean.

1069
01:02:13,739 --> 01:02:14,479
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1070
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:16,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Jaded's a good guy, too.

1071
01:02:16,301 --> 01:02:17,562
[SPEAKER_09]: He really supports us.

1072
01:02:17,662 --> 01:02:21,646
[SPEAKER_09]: I shouldn't have hung up on him, but I'm just feeling a little feisty tonight.

1073
01:02:22,967 --> 01:02:23,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Should we do one more call?

1074
01:02:24,707 --> 01:02:24,747
[SPEAKER_09]: PS3

1075
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:49,280
[SPEAKER_07]: Guess what?

1076
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:52,801
[SPEAKER_07]: You pay $600 for it, you get no HDMI cable.

1077
01:02:52,921 --> 01:02:59,322
[SPEAKER_07]: So it sucks to be you hooking it up to a high-end media center or something like that.

1078
01:02:59,402 --> 01:03:01,023
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, whatever.

1079
01:03:01,483 --> 01:03:04,063
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, of course, some other things.

1080
01:03:05,344 --> 01:03:14,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking, since you were talking about, well, they were talking about accessories for the DS, Europe is supposed to be seeing a DS MP3 player this October.

1081
01:03:15,266 --> 01:03:16,126
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of neat.

1082
01:03:17,159 --> 01:03:22,040
[SPEAKER_07]: and supposedly it's going to be using the flash... What was that?

1083
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:24,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Just collect those SD memory cards.

1084
01:03:25,481 --> 01:03:25,701
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1085
01:03:26,101 --> 01:03:28,442
[SPEAKER_07]: We're getting another call on the skyline, so I'm going to go to that right now, okay?

1086
01:03:28,742 --> 01:03:29,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Okie dokie.

1087
01:03:29,262 --> 01:03:29,502
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1088
01:03:29,542 --> 01:03:30,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1089
01:03:30,563 --> 01:03:30,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

1090
01:03:33,343 --> 01:03:33,823
[SPEAKER_07]: No one.

1091
01:03:34,664 --> 01:03:35,564
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a crank call!

1092
01:03:36,404 --> 01:03:36,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Crank call.

1093
01:03:37,004 --> 01:03:37,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1094
01:03:38,305 --> 01:03:43,006
[SPEAKER_07]: And the last one I had, which was really cool, there's five games that...

1095
01:03:44,301 --> 01:03:48,107
[SPEAKER_07]: are coming to Xbox Live Arcade from NVIDIA.

1096
01:03:48,307 --> 01:03:50,991
[SPEAKER_07]: And you might know NVIDIA who happen to be...

1097
01:03:52,586 --> 01:03:54,948
[SPEAKER_07]: They own the rights to the Sierra games.

1098
01:03:55,288 --> 01:04:14,465
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to be getting wonderful games like Megaforce, which I never played, 3D Ultra Mini Golf, which was fucking awesome on the PC, and I used to play this online all the time, Red Baron, and two other games, one based on The Incredible Machine, and one based on the popular TV series Battlestar Galactica.

1099
01:04:15,005 --> 01:04:18,028
[SPEAKER_07]: I am incredibly excited about The Incredible Machine game.

1100
01:04:18,510 --> 01:04:20,431
[SPEAKER_07]: XBOX Live Arcade King's Quest, Space Quest, Leisure Suit Larry

1101
01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:51,700
[SPEAKER_09]: bring me these games on a console yes I know I can get most to that stuff through GameTap and that's cool but you know I played those games on a computer before I want to do something on a console I want

1102
01:04:52,358 --> 01:04:55,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Achievement Points for King's Quest 4.

1103
01:04:55,661 --> 01:04:56,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that too much to ask?

1104
01:04:57,482 --> 01:04:58,623
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to know something funny?

1105
01:04:58,683 --> 01:05:00,524
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just purely observational.

1106
01:05:01,565 --> 01:05:06,589
[SPEAKER_07]: GamersReports.com You know how they have banner ads on websites and stuff like that?

1107
01:05:07,049 --> 01:05:10,252
[SPEAKER_07]: This one has a banner ad for a London escort service.

1108
01:05:10,632 --> 01:05:11,953
[SPEAKER_07]: I just thought that was kind of funny.

1109
01:05:12,674 --> 01:05:14,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they have escorts on a gaming news site.

1110
01:05:15,556 --> 01:05:15,896
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1111
01:05:16,757 --> 01:05:17,838
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm easily amused tonight.

1112
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:19,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know.

1113
01:05:19,539 --> 01:05:19,619
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm...

1114
01:05:22,268 --> 01:05:25,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, and there's rumors about Rez coming to the Wii.

1115
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:26,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah?

1116
01:05:26,150 --> 01:05:27,611
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be kind of cool.

1117
01:05:28,051 --> 01:05:30,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't know if that's really anything, you know.

1118
01:05:31,513 --> 01:05:37,316
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if they've actually got info to back that up, but it's probably one of those, yeah, that would be cool to, you know.

1119
01:05:38,956 --> 01:05:40,377
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm seriously considering it.

1120
01:05:40,417 --> 01:05:43,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that was the quote here.

1121
01:05:43,799 --> 01:05:45,980
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm currently seriously considering it.

1122
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,301
[SPEAKER_07]: It's always been there.

1123
01:05:47,521 --> 01:05:49,662
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm always thinking about it.

1124
01:05:50,322 --> 01:05:51,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, Space Channel 5.

1125
01:05:53,895 --> 01:05:56,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Space Channel 5 is so awesome.

1126
01:05:56,838 --> 01:05:57,579
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that game.

1127
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:00,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Space Channel 5 on the Wii?

1128
01:06:00,662 --> 01:06:02,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you imagine that?

1129
01:06:02,224 --> 01:06:05,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Where you'd have to do the motions for the different dances and stuff?

1130
01:06:05,928 --> 01:06:06,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Chew!

1131
01:06:06,688 --> 01:06:07,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Chew!

1132
01:06:07,690 --> 01:06:09,111
[SPEAKER_07]: So you'd be doing the dances too?

1133
01:06:09,451 --> 01:06:10,052
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be kind of funny.

1134
01:06:11,333 --> 01:06:11,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1135
01:06:12,234 --> 01:06:12,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else?

1136
01:06:13,475 --> 01:06:13,956
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

1137
01:06:14,358 --> 01:06:17,060
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to bring our show to a close then for this evening.

1138
01:06:17,721 --> 01:06:20,203
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to go around and get everybody's final thought.

1139
01:06:20,243 --> 01:06:22,565
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you guys, by the way, for tuning in and supporting Independent Radio.

1140
01:06:22,605 --> 01:06:27,829
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we were a little crazy tonight and, you know, we appreciate you guys sticking by us no matter what.

1141
01:06:27,889 --> 01:06:30,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Miklatov, thank you for being here even though you barely ever talked at all.

1142
01:06:31,331 --> 01:06:32,072
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm reading.

1143
01:06:32,412 --> 01:06:33,053
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you reading?

1144
01:06:33,113 --> 01:06:33,673
[SPEAKER_09]: What's more important?

1145
01:06:33,693 --> 01:06:36,055
[SPEAKER_09]: You're chatting on Instant Messenger, at least be honest.

1146
01:06:37,036 --> 01:06:38,577
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also reading about Blue Maze.

1147
01:06:38,597 --> 01:06:40,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Who are you chatting with on Instant Messenger?

1148
01:06:40,379 --> 01:06:43,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Jazz and, god, I don't remember his name on DDR Freak and that

1149
01:06:44,093 --> 01:06:50,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Makes me angry, but the guy that sent us, or that sent the cookies for Ultramix 2.

1150
01:06:50,157 --> 01:06:50,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh!

1151
01:06:50,277 --> 01:06:55,920
[SPEAKER_05]: I only know him by his real name now, I don't remember his... I know his name on Xbox Live, but I can't... El Mullet!

1152
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:58,402
[SPEAKER_05]: El Mullet, yes, I'm talking to El Mullet.

1153
01:06:59,662 --> 01:07:00,303
[SPEAKER_05]: How's he doing?

1154
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:01,643
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't heard from him in a while.

1155
01:07:01,663 --> 01:07:02,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Does he still listen to the show?

1156
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:03,785
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea, because I didn't ask him.

1157
01:07:03,805 --> 01:07:04,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Ask him if he's listening.

1158
01:07:05,085 --> 01:07:06,266
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll maybe do that later.

1159
01:07:06,566 --> 01:07:06,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Fine.

1160
01:07:07,327 --> 01:07:09,008
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking about Dance Factory right now.

1161
01:07:09,028 --> 01:07:09,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, fine.

1162
01:07:09,810 --> 01:07:11,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that game came out last week.

1163
01:07:11,431 --> 01:07:14,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and it's pretty stupid from what I understand, but it's getting good scores.

1164
01:07:14,353 --> 01:07:15,534
[SPEAKER_07]: It is getting good scores.

1165
01:07:15,554 --> 01:07:16,415
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what the scores are?

1166
01:07:16,655 --> 01:07:18,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, because then you can put any song in it.

1167
01:07:18,737 --> 01:07:21,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but all those dance steps are probably crap.

1168
01:07:21,239 --> 01:07:22,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and off-sync apparently.

1169
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:27,563
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's eye-toily mode doesn't work, I guess, which makes it equally cool.

1170
01:07:27,643 --> 01:07:32,247
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they have a bundle with a really crappy dance pad coming out in October.

1171
01:07:32,887 --> 01:07:33,468
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought that was funny.

1172
01:07:33,488 --> 01:07:34,869
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something I'll be skipping.

1173
01:07:37,042 --> 01:07:39,924
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what game they should put out over here that's coming out in the UK?

1174
01:07:41,064 --> 01:07:41,504
[SPEAKER_07]: B-Boy.

1175
01:07:41,925 --> 01:07:42,785
[SPEAKER_07]: That looked pretty cool.

1176
01:07:43,405 --> 01:07:45,066
[SPEAKER_05]: I vaguely remember that.

1177
01:07:45,567 --> 01:07:48,048
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a breakdancing game.

1178
01:07:48,188 --> 01:07:49,168
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's not DDR.

1179
01:07:49,209 --> 01:07:52,230
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of like a Bust the Move.

1180
01:07:53,211 --> 01:07:54,731
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love that, actually.

1181

[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys can see this right now, it's the stupidest thing ever.

1187
01:08:56,363 --> 01:08:58,184

1196
01:09:12,093 --> 01:09:14,034
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to play more Saints Row tomorrow.

1197
01:09:14,094 --> 01:09:17,416
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is I'm really sorry for making a mess of myself tonight, and...

1198
01:09:18,266 --> 01:09:20,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, I'm sorry to the callers I hung up on.

1199

[SPEAKER_09]: I'm really not that mean usually.

1200
01:09:21,307 --> 01:09:26,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Stock salt here and I'll be able to get more drunk next time because I can drink faster that way.
