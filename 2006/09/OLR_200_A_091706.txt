Tonight, September 17th, 2006.
Oh my god, Wii.
Oh my god, free Xbox Live for Europe.
Oh my god, we have a major update regarding Phantasy Star Universe.
And, oh my god, episode 200.
Orange Lounge Radio.
Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
The Monty Talk, and then some.
Orange Lounge may contain adult content.
Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.
Just kidding.
Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex in this episode.
The last Metroid is in captivity.
The galaxy...
Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.
Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.
You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
Yes, I will spank your child.
If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.
Oh wait, most children already are evil little demons from hell.
Now you see that evil will always triumph because good is dumb.
Fat, drunk, and stupid is no way to go through life, son.
He jeopardizes my ability to effectively govern this student body.
Well, makes you look like an ass is what he does, eh?
Sandburgers!
The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast.
That was huge.
Cool.
Do you mind if I take my new car for a ride?
DarkSakura.
Oh my god, I see a bloody stump!
Any time, any place, baby Loki Ow, my foot!
Why did I shoot myself in my foot?
Orange Lounge Radio We are live, and this is episode number 200 for this September the 17th of 2006 You're listening to The Beat
Imani Scene's most ancient podcast and radio station of all things Bomani.
But as of about a year ago... As of about a year ago, all things video games...
Tonight is a very special show, boys and girls.
Yes, that intro was specially made just for tonight.
Hope you enjoyed it.
Oh my God, there's fire in here right now.
Chris has surprised us with her presence, and she's brought us a cake with a big $200.
That's so cute.
Wait, hold on, hold on.
I have to take a picture of my cell phone, so we have something for the site.
Because we're a podcast.
Have I told you lately that I love you for that intro?
Oh, this is so cute.
I took a picture.
We'll put it up on the website later.
What are we wishing for?
Stuff.
All right.
One, two, three.
Yay!
We blew them all out.
It comes true.
All right.
Thank you guys so much.
This is awesome.
Wow.
Well, my name is Rob Roberts.
You might know me as Sky.
Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only... I was trying to re-invoke the old intro there, but that threw me off.
So much for that.
Say hi!
Say hello to the... Another surprise?
Jesus!
Oh my god, I got a... This is just crazy.
I just got a tiara that says Over the Hill and Loki has one too.
That's great.
And Jamie has one too.
Oh my god, you guys are too much.
Aww, you guys!
Thank you!
Happy, happy birthday from the internet to you.
We wish it was our birthday so we could party too.
Hey, happy, happy birthday.
May all your gamer dreams come true.
Happy, happy birthday from all of us to you.
Hey!
Oh my god.
I don't know if I'm going to be able to do tonight's show.
Alright, say hello to the one and only, happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
Hi.
I found the ferret!
Woo!
Woo, ferret!
And definitely one person needs more caffeine.
Damn.
Could he be any more chill, Loki?
All right, say hello as well to Chris, who's brought us all these wonderful surprises.
Thank you, Chris.
Oh, that's okay.
I thought of it up as Jamie and I were eating lunch.
I said, you know what?
I should bring donuts.
You know what?
Fuck that.
It's their special birthday.
We need something better.
So we thought we'd get the carbiest, most sugariest thing we could find, which has very...
DDR Sneak Peeks
And it's confirmed, the ferret is gay We have our gay ferret Alright, let's try to get some gaming news out of our system Because we had a lot, a lot, a lot of it this week So first off, we start off every show How is your gaming week, DarkSakura?
My gaming week was actually still more pinball We got another pinball machine Another one We have a Guns N' Roses pinball My god, you guys are nuts We're working on it right now And I played some more Mario
and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and.
That's it.
All right.
Loki, how was your gaming week?
Oh, I watched some porn, too.
Oh, congratulations.
Thank you.
Was it head-tired?
And I got some yelling now.
How was your gaming week?
I don't know if that would be considered game.
I consider it fun.
Well... You can play the Yowie drinking game.
I streamed HD porn to my 360, so does that count?
I was there when you did that.
Tell everyone, do I get to lick the frosting off the candle?
Yes!
Well, actually, I had another one, too, that we downloaded that we streamed off my wonderful laptop here because it has Media Center Edition on it.
But, no, yeah, you can stream stuff with Media Center Extender and...
and unfortunately, well, actually fortunately, the only thing that we had to test it with is porno.
So we streamed, you know, 720p porno.
And the only thing we had to test with was porno.
So, yeah.
So we did that and it is very crisp.
Very, very crisp.
The only thing I'm disappointed with... I actually saw it too, and I will never see a clearer muff in my entire life.
The only thing that's bad about it though, and I don't know if... I couldn't stream it with like Dolby or anything like that.
That would be really cool if I could do that.
But, you know, whatever, it's cool.
So we did that.
So actual gaming stuff, I actually played some stuff, including, and I don't know why, I got it for free from work, Bomberman Act Zero.
and it started off pretty fun, but the whole thing, it's really sad that the game fails by things that I would think that would be really easy for the devs to either fix or, I don't know, figure out that they were wrong in the first place.
The first thing, of course, being the fact that you don't
You can't save at all, so if you were to beat the game, you'd have to play through 99 levels straight.
By the way, only one hit and you're dead, and you have to go all the way back to one, so that kind of sucks.
There's no live system or anything like that.
That's really kind of the only thing that detracts you from the whole game, that and the fact that the camera angles are kind of confusing sometimes.
So, I don't know, it gets annoying, but it's still Barman, it's pretty fun, but, you know, I wouldn't have paid money for it, so thank God I didn't have to.
XBOX Live Arcade
You need to really make some better games to put them out on live.
Konami, Gradius, K-Thanks.
Also, maybe make your games, I don't know, widescreen?
I mean, seriously, if they remade it for the graphics and stuff, why didn't they just add widescreen support to it?
I don't know, that wouldn't be that difficult.
You get pretty borders on the left and right side of the screen.
Same borders are in every Konami arcade game.
Anyway, so I played those.
I played a little bit more Geometry Wars.
I played multiplayer on Marble Blast, which was kind of lame.
I don't like the multiplayer on Marble Blast because every time you start a multiplayer game, you're in the middle of someone else's game.
So there's no possible way for you to win because they're like 75 points ahead of you.
Well, wait until the game's over and then they start a new game.
That's fine, but that doesn't always happen.
So that's kind of lame, but whatever.
And then what else did I play?
more Grand Theft Auto of course actually I emailed Rockstar about Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories because we do play it so much and we were bragging or I was bragging to them that I probably played it more than the devs did and I think I probably did since it doesn't seem like they played it much and then yeah so hopefully I'll hear back from them because I want to know how their multiplayer is coming for that game because they better not fuck it up or I will fly down there and beat them to death anything else?
Uh, that's... Oh, I play Mario Kart on the DS while I was waiting for my dad for a movie today.
Fun.
I play Battle Mode, and I don't like the Battle Mode in there.
Alright, um, I'm going to our chat room, which of course is always one of our other guests, www.orangelandtrader.com Oh, I'm sorry, and I play Chrome Helms in multiplayer.
And got your ass kicked from what I hear.
Well, that's because my mech sucks.
I'm looking at our chat room, in fact, so many people in chat tonight, the names are scrolling off the screen.
We can't see, so...
Anyway, I want to point out Robert M in chat says, I'd like to see Gyruss on live.
It's coming.
We know it's coming.
It's been previously announced.
When?
Couldn't tell you, but that's one I'm looking forward to as well.
I love Gyruss.
Awesome game.
My Gaming Week.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I don't like Stage 2.
The stupid, I don't know what the fuck it is, little asteroid things are pissing me off.
I can't shoot fast enough in that game.
It will not let me shoot as fast as I want to.
You know the trick?
This is what I do.
I put the controller down, and I tap the buttons like my fingers are running between bullet, bomb, bullet, bomb, bullet, bomb.
And I do that really fast, and that's how I get all the way through stage four, at least.
Because stage five, the trick is you have to maneuver around really quickly, and it's kind of hard.
It's a hard stage.
Since that ship is like a boat.
So anyway, we have done...
Scramble, and it's okay.
I mean, if you like the classics, the upgrade was actually one of the nicer upgrades.
The graphics do look really well, and the sound's been done a lot better.
But the game itself, I can't recommend it when it's put next to $5 games such as Geometry Wars, and hell, even something like Frogger or Time Pilot was a better buy than Scramble, I'm sorry to say.
I wish they would put effort into better games, but that's just me.
The other game I played was...
Surprisingly pleasant.
I played Test Drive Unlimited, which I actually enjoyed quite a bit.
The gameplay is a lot like it reminded me of Need for Speed Underground, and so you're probably thinking to yourself, okay, why do I need yet another racer on the Xbox 360?
What makes this so special?
Well, Test Drive Unlimited is massive.
You are literally driving around the entire island of Oahu, and it's not 100% geographically correct, but for folks who've never been there like me,
It's got that illusion of that it does seem to be pretty right on to what it's probably really like in that environment.
And you drive around and you do different races, like you stop at different intersections and do races, or you pick up hookers and take them to the shopping place they need to go, or you drive cars, hitchhikers, lots of different types of quests and things you can do.
It's a questing driving game.
But the other weird thing about it that's getting this game a lot of notoriety is that even when you're playing in single player mode, if you're playing on Xbox Live...
Some of the dummy cars that you usually see driving in traffic are actually other players.
And you'll see their Xbox Live name.
They are playing single mode as well.
So it's kind of like an MMO, but not really.
It's the weirdest concept.
That is exactly why I can't get that game, because I'd be such a jackass.
It's weird, though.
I'll tell you what, though.
I love the idea, and I think it's great that they're doing this to make the game different than other racing games.
But I don't know.
I find when I'm racing around, I don't really run into other people right next to them very often.
I've driven by maybe three people.
Supposedly, you're supposed to crash into them and start a race, but sometimes they drive by so fast, you don't even realize somebody went by.
I guess that's what you have to do.
It's interesting.
It's an interesting concept.
I'll have to play the game a little more to see how it's fully enabled.
I just joined the Oil Army Clan thanks to Robway.
He created the Oil Army Clan on the game, so I just joined that.
So look for that if you're on test drive.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
The other quick thing I wanted to say about Test Drive Unlimited is I was kind of bummed out that some of the multiplayer races, at least none of the ones I drove by, were restricted by car class because I got the game about a week after it came out and by the time I'm ready to do multiplayer races, everybody in there has like a souped up maximum top of the line car.
So I would have liked to have seen some multiplayer races that were restricted a little more by the class car so you could have like beginner multiplayer races, intermediate, and not everybody's just kicking my ass because they have a top of the line car because they've been playing longer.
So that was my thought.
So
I do recommend Test Drive Unlimited if you're a fan of driving games.
And I think even if you're not a fan of driving games, rent it, check it out, because you might... I mean, it's a good deal, $40.
It's cheaper than the usual Xbox 360 games, so it's hard for me to ignore that as well, being a big factor in why I would recommend this game for you to pick up.
Plus, it's fun driving a Lamborghini off-road.
It is, but... Over hills.
The cops get annoying.
They get really annoying.
I wish there was a way you could turn them off.
No, it's funny, but the cops, they can't follow you off-road.
Oh, really?
I didn't realize that.
No, they're stupid.
They can't figure out how to get off the road, so they have to just drive through an unpaved section.
They're like, duh, where'd he go?
Or just sit in the grass, and they're like, oh, I don't know how to get to him.
JeremyTaw1 in chat says, a friend I know that lives in Hawaii says the map is really close to the area, but it isn't perfect.
He says he can see where he is in the game because he knows the roads in person.
So, yeah, it's pretty close to the actual thing.
It's kind of interesting.
All right.
Drew Nami, how was your gaming week?
Well, not too eventful.
I've been leveling a warrior in World of Warcraft.
It's pretty good.
I can see where a lot of people say they're IMBA, but I haven't really got past 18, so that remains to be seen.
I've also been trying to finish Zenisaga Episode 1, or rather watching it.
I admit, I like it even though it's very, very long on cutscenes, and the battle system is sort of frustrating.
But it's a good game, very deep story.
Other than that, I haven't really been doing much in the way of gaming.
All right.
Chris, anything you want to share with how your gaming week's been going?
Well, you remembered me this time.
I did, I'm sorry.
How could I forget?
You brought me cake.
I brought you chocolate.
You're a skanky, skanky ho-bag.
Yeah, I know.
No, no, she said Rob is.
Hey, why am I a skanky ho-bag?
That's her way of saying she loves you.
That's her way of saying she loves you.
Oh, okay.
Hugs and kisses and smoothies to you, sweetie.
Aside from Sins 2, I got Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance and Baldur's Gate 2 Dark Alliance.
I found them on Amazon for each $60, but I got them new.
Did it have a monkey on the cover?
No, it didn't have a monkey.
Shut up.
I've been playing both of those because I never got to finish both of them.
I like it.
That was my gaming week.
Alright, right on.
And I burned my fingernail lighting your candles.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
About the 200th regular week we've been putting out some type of gaming-related programming out there.
Not to mention all the live shows that we've done, special shows and fuck-off shows.
Exactly.
We've been live at E3.
We were live at Arena this year for E3.
We were live at the B3 DDR tournament.
We were live at a Scandia tournament.
We were live at some...
Weren't we live at Milpitas once?
Golf Land for DDR?
I think we were.
Just a bunch of crazy shit we've been doing throughout the years with DDR community.
And now general gaming as well.
We know our fan base has now expanded past just those who are into music games.
And of course, we'll never forget our love of music games.
We always have plenty of news.
Of course, we have the DDR sneak peeks tonight.
I think that just further goes to show that.
We haven't forgotten our roots.
Konami finally noticed us like two months ago.
It's kind of amazing.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network
Like, you know, we're not afraid to run the rumors when we sense there's some bit of legitimacy to them.
And we want to, you know, scoop the big, big media reports and things of that nature.
But unfortunately, once in a while, something's going to happen that causes us to be wrong.
And unfortunately, this time it happens to be a big one.
And this was a story that was picked up on a lot of news sites that we ran.
Loki, what happened?
And this isn't really our fault.
No, it's not.
It's the company, the site.
But you guys have to understand, this is what's going to happen when we do this.
You know, is Ain't It Cool News right all the time?
Hell no, they're not.
But, you know, they... And stuff changes all the time.
I mean, it's just like when we report dates and stuff.
Dates change all the time.
But anyways, this is about the Phantasy Star Universe online subscription fees.
Um, before we reported that the Xbox 360 version would be free and the PlayStation 2 and PC would be pay.
Well, Sega went back on what they decided to do and they're deciding to charge for the online service.
And here is exactly why they're doing it.
Um, and this is straight from an email from our sales rep from Sega.
It says, um,
I just wanted to update you on what's going on regarding the subscription service we have with Phantasy Star Universe.
As you know, the game will have an extensive 40-hour single-player mode as well as online questing mode that allows players to create a character, customize that character, and meet up with other players to complete quests online.
The single-player portion is separate from the online mode, and it will work as normal on PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, and PC.
The online mode, however, is a bit different.
To play online, the user will have to create an account with Sega and pay a monthly fee of $9.99.
This will be required for all versions of the game, including the 360 version.
Previously, we had thought the 360 version would not have a fee due to the Xbox Live fees.
That has since changed.
The good news is, this is nothing new for Phantasy Star Universe, in that all online versions of Phantasy Star have had this fee in the past, and that even the last Xbox version, which played over Live,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
However, the good news is that we have a marketplace demo that will allow users to get a small taste of the offline and online portions of the game.
And it says, I know subscription fees are not a very common thing for the console games, and that's why I wanted to inform you of this.
Well, unfortunate, but I mean, Sega told us one thing and then told us another, but as you can understand, I mean, you know they were considering it.
They were considering it, and I think what it comes down to is that they found out they can charge for it, and so they went ahead and did it.
I mean, and
A lot of negative feedback from chat.
People saying they're not going to get the game now because they don't pay for MMOs on monthly.
I'm with them on that.
I was going to buy the game, and to be honest, I'm not really interested anymore.
I'm interested in the Marketplace demo.
I'm going to make my decision solely based off the demo.
I am encouraged that at least the demo they're going to put on Marketplace will support on and offline, and that will be the decision maker for me.
I'll pay for MMOs.
I paid for World of Warcraft.
I paid for Final Fantasy XI.
I'm not against paying for MMOs, but it's got to be good, and I want to try it before I buy it.
It's called Guild Wars.
Well, they don't have Guild Wars on the 360.
That's why I don't play MMOs on the 360, because I don't have the time to dedicate, you know, to play it regularly, so I don't want to pay this extra monthly fee, because I know I'm not going to use it.
Whereas, you know, Phantasy Star, I figured, okay, I get to buy it, and I can play online whenever I want.
Awesome, you know, that sold it for me.
But now this news, you know, right when I saw it, I was like, fuck, you know.
I knew this was something that was going to possibly happen, so not a huge surprise, since they've been charging all,
You know, all the time, but whatever.
I mean, life goes on, I guess.
Yeah, kind of unfortunate.
Jamie, I'm really curious about your thoughts, because you're a big Phantasy Star supporter, and I imagine you're probably going to play this anyway, but what do you think about all this back and forth, paying, no paying stuff?
I think half of it is that they're charging because, well, first of all, they're in the business to make money, so why shouldn't they charge?
But regardless, and actually Ranma made this point in the chat room, it's still one of the cheapest MMOs you can play.
I think that, you know...
I think that if charging the fee might lead to better service, you know, give them more money for development into the game to expand it later on, that's my hope.
But I really don't care because I was going to play it anyway.
All right.
I figured if you want to play something bad enough, no price should keep you from enjoying it.
All right.
Well, we'll see.
We encourage your emails if you want to give us some feedback on this.
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.
And I imagine some people might be kind of pissed at us for reporting the news before, but you know what, guys?
We had certainly a big reason to believe it was true, because Sega told us.
So, you know, if you are unhappy with that, sorry.
I guess you can stick to getting press releases and things when everybody else gets them and won't know any news beforehand.
But to Loki's credit, a lot of the rest of that story has turned out to be right on when it comes to a lot of the stories about the Wii that we're going to get into tonight and the GT steering wheel and some of the other things that you report in that story are coming true.
We can't predict the future.
If they go and change what their plan is for something, we're not
We're not going to know.
I mean, it's up to them.
So if they decide to go back on what they want charged, hell, we can't be right all the time when it comes to them changing stuff.
Right, right.
All right, well, as we mentioned, there was a lot of big news this week.
Big, big, big news about this little system coming out from Nintendo called Wii.
And we're dedicating just about the rest of this segment to talk about this because there was so much news that came with the Wii.
So, of course, if you've been living in a cave or for some reason you only get your gaming news from OLR, which is kind of cool, I guess, here's the deal.
The Wii is coming out on November 19th, and it's coming out for a price of $250.00.
249.99.
Whatever.
After tax, it's going to be over $250.
It's going to be packaged with Wii Sports.
Controllers will be sold separately.
The Wiimote, which is the official name for it, it sounds like, the Wiimote is going to be what?
The remote and nunchuck.
One price, and then the nunchuck, the Wiimote's going to be like $40, and the nunchuck's going to be $20.
And that was everything that was announced at the press conference.
Pretty much the price point it looks like right now is the remote's going to be $39.99.
Whereas the attachments are going to be $19.99.
And who called the price?
That would be me.
Good job.
So, yeah, so that's where it stands.
Now, a lot of people are saying the controllers are too damn expensive.
No.
But, I didn't, I mean, okay, because when you consider it's the nunchuck and the controller, it's going to be about $60.
You don't have to buy the nunchuck.
You do not have to have it.
A lot of games do not use it unless it's like a first-person shooter.
Plus, I do believe, isn't a wireless Xbox 360 controller $49?
It's $49.99, and that's not even with the rechargeable, I mean, granted, the Wii does not have a rechargeable battery pack, at least as far as I'm aware.
Two double A's, but it does last
Quite a long time, apparently.
And so, I don't know.
I'm not trying to knock Xbox 360's price at all.
I think it's fair.
I'm just saying, you know, Nintendo doesn't seem that bad, but a lot of people were very disappointed in the price that they heard.
And I thought it was kind of like, well, isn't that what kind of everyone was expecting?
I guess some people had their sights on $200.
But I don't know.
I want to say, I swear to God, I said on this show previously, I bet you anything Wii Sports is a pack-in game.
And people were telling me, no, because they haven't done a pack-in game in years.
No, it makes perfect sense.
No, Wii Sports is like,
It's not gamey enough to be a game, but it's good enough to be a packing game.
It's just like world-class track meet.
That's exactly what it is to me.
It's world-class track meet.
It's also something that's very simple.
They'll teach you how to use the controller and stuff like that.
Exactly.
All right, well, we have plenty of Wii news all around the table tonight.
Well, there is a bit more about Wii Sports.
Again, it is going to be bundled in with the Wii at release, but there's been suggestions, especially, actually, it states that...
for EGM that it was going to support over 30 different games.
But the official ones listed are tennis, baseball, golf, bowling, and boxing.
And it's all pretty much the same simple thing.
Like for anyone who watched the press release, it's pretty much the same type style of thing that you saw in the press release.
Okay.
I guess bowling is a sport.
Bowling will be kind of fun.
I wonder if it will have curling.
Tennis wasn't bad, but again, I bet baseball will be a lot of fun with multiple people.
And you know, I think the concept and the reason why the remote costs so much and watching the Wii press event and everything, I think the concept is you're going to build your personality on your Wii remote thing and you want to take it to other places, right?
Well, actually, it's stating that in particular for Wii Sports is that you're going to use your, I guess, the Mii caricature to play in the game so that you can actually play versus people to personalize the game for you.
So I don't think that it's Nintendo wants you to buy four Wiimotes for your household.
They want you and all three of your friends to buy Wiis, and then you bring your Wiimote with you, like you bring your iPod with you everywhere to share music.
You're going to bring your Wiimote, and I guess I'm also being corrected in chat, that's not the real name.
It's going to be the Wii Remote, but I don't care.
It's a Wii Remote, or Wiimote.
I feel like WiiCon.
I think they've used Wiimote actually.
I swear I heard in that press conference somebody say Wiimote, but whatever, it doesn't matter.
So whatever that thing is, the thing, you're going to take the thing with you to other people's houses and then, you know, your character's on there ready to go.
And it has, didn't we already reveal on this show previously in some news article that it had some type of storage on the actual remote itself?
So it probably saves basic stats and things.
Like, you know, you can go to your friend's house and, oh, hey, you're four and two in baseball right now.
Let's play, you know.
Sort of be like bringing your memory card with you.
Or your DS.
Yeah.
I think that's exactly what it is.
So, I don't know.
Anyways.
Well, some other interesting things about the Wii.
In Japan, of course, which was the first news that we got about the Wii, it's going to be launching for 25,000 yen.
And what's kind of interesting, though, is they are not getting the pack-in for Wii Sports.
That is separate.
You have to buy that separately.
And that's actually going to cost...
around 3,800 yen is going to be the price of the remote, 1,800 for the nunchuck attachment, and 1,800 for the classic controller, which also, by the way, 1,999 for the classic controller in the United States.
Wii Sports, though, is going to be a pretty inexpensive game.
So that should be pretty interesting.
One of the other games I saw on there, which is really cool, Wii Play, which is going to be for the people that saw the E3 tech demos and stuff, like the shooting demo.
Duck Hunt?
Yeah, like the Duck Hunt game.
Those are in Wii Play, some of them.
So that's kind of cool.
Hopefully we'll get it in the States.
I know that UK's getting it and stuff like that, but it should be interesting.
Camden in our chat room is making a little play on the whole Mii thing and put Mii Emoto.
Get it?
Yeah.
You remember when you saw the E3 demo with all four of them playing and the little heads were on the bodies and they looked like Miyamoto and everything?
That was it, because they had made their things on the Mi.
Now it all makes sense.
So that's kind of interesting.
I just want to say real quick, or ask a quick question.
Why do you think Japan's not getting Wii Sports?
Why do you think they opted not to do that and do a cheaper bundle instead without it?
Just economical reasons, I actually stand a chance of making more money having the game separate.
Also, Japan's getting theirs on December 2nd, which is surprising because they're not the first ones to launch with the Wii, the United States is.
Interesting.
We're loved.
Heart, Nintendo.
Anyway, as far as speaking of the Nintendo love, this is in UK news.
The Wii is going to retail for 249 euros, which is 179 pounds in the UK.
Also with it will be about 20 release games.
It's Wii Play, Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess, and some third-party games like Red Steel, Need for Speed Carbon, Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam, Pixar's Cars.
and Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz.
That sounds kind of fun.
Also, it will be bundled with Wii Sports as well.
It will come with one Wii Remote, one Nunchuck and, again, Wii Sports.
I think it's funny that they're getting the... I think it's interesting that Europe is not getting the shaft for once with the release time.
I mean, sure, we're beating them to it, but to be ahead of Japan...
That's weird to me that Japan isn't getting this thing until December.
That is so weird to me.
Well, actually, it says that the European release date is 8th of December.
Oh, my bad.
I thought it was before.
I'm sorry.
I was going to say.
My bad, my bad.
Okay, so Europe did get the shaft.
Sorry, guys.
It's not that bad.
It's not as bad as the usual Nintendo shaft.
It's not as bad.
So I guess there's that.
And I understand why they're doing it.
It's because they're launching so many units in the United States.
They've got to catch up, make sure they have enough for the launch in the other territories.
Well, it's also going to, of course, we'll be going into a little bit more about this later.
Of course, we'll have the Wii Channel menu and a pretty interesting interface.
All right.
Well, if you want to spin your globe all the way around and take a look at Australia, Australia's launch looks pretty comparable to what Europe's getting.
The console's going to launch there on December 7, 2006.
The retail price will be $399.95, but that's Australian.
And then they're also going to have Wii Sports as their pack-in game.
And, of course, all the other good stuff you've been hearing about with the interface and everything.
Nothing too different there.
But Australia's not being left out of the worldwide launch.
So it looks like Nintendo has this worldwide launch thing down where Sony, with their whole worldwide means Japan and the U.S.
only, might need to... Sony just makes it easy to bash on them.
I really don't want to.
My question for Nintendo is, what about Africa?
Where is that only the domain of Sony now?
Africa.
Africa.
So...
Well, maybe we'll hear something on that later, I don't know.
But we all know that Mr. Kudaragi needs crayons and wears a helmet, so we can't be too upset at him.
I will be curious to see.
Again, I think like most PlayStation consoles, and I don't want to get off topic too much, but like most PlayStation consoles, I don't think we'll truly be able to judge the PlayStation 3 until this time next year.
I really don't think we're going to start seeing the big guns until then, but whatever.
Whatever.
I did say November I gave you a couple weeks in November
Meg Z got an exact date.
I think I should point that out.
I saw her call that on her live journal.
That was cool.
She was really, really happy about that.
I do want to point out, Loki, in your thing you did on 198, you were one of the first people to say, hey, Nintendo is debating launching after Sony.
Because most people, when they were guessing the launch date, were guessing things before the 17th.
You were one of the first people to say, they are thinking about doing it after.
To be honest, all the dates in our system that we had, all the launch games were on the 15th of November.
And I was like, that's got to be a to-be-announced date, because there's no way that they would launch it at the same time as Sony.
And here I was wrong, though.
It was right in front of my face.
But whatever.
Who cares?
It's just a fun little game until the system actually launches.
Ranma in our chat regarding the Wii launch in Africa says, Fuck them.
Send Africa refurbished N64s.
That's not nice.
Have Ellen give out some Wiis.
Have Ellen give out some Wiis to Africa.
I hate Ellen.
We'll send Suzanne Summers there.
with food for the starving children and wheeze.
You guys, he gave away to a blind guy.
What the hell is he going to do with that?
There's lots of areas to Africa and I'm sure some of them are waiting and willing for their wheeze.
They want it.
I actually did go searching for the date.
I could not find it, but I would imagine given that the majority of the world is getting theirs in December, theirs is probably close to the same time.
If not, then early next year.
I'm sure you will have your wheeze soon enough, Africa.
Anyway, it's
Well, as we mentioned before, I believe we talked about this, it came out that the Wii will not support DVD playback.
Now, what we were told, of course, before is that they're going to have an add-on little thing for it, kind of like the Xbox did where you'd be able to play DVDs.
Well, they've opted on not doing that at all.
In fact, it says that Nintendo of America's Vice President of Marketing and Corporate Affairs, Perrin Kaplan, confirmed to IGN,
We today that its forthcoming Wii console will not play Hollywood DVD movies.
The decision to remove the functionality was made in order to deliver the machine at cheaper costs because most people today already own DVD players.
And to be honest, it makes perfect sense.
The GameCube didn't play DVDs, and I wasn't sad about it, so who cares?
You know what's interesting about this?
This is a direct opposite philosophy to what Sony's doing.
DarkSakura.com
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
There are things that are in the interface that aren't only strictly games, right?
So there's a little something extra.
That is true, but I still think that the focus is on games and should stay that way.
That's why I think that Sony's shooting themselves in the balls.
I think it's more of a cost of technology thing where it's like, you know, why pay for the DVD player to be in there, you know,
I didn't catch this.
Why did Nintendo tell you there was going to be a dongle and now they didn't?
That's because of the licensing for DVD playback.
You have to pay for licensing fees, and that's why they charge for that stuff, because it covers the cost of licensing.
That's why Xbox does the same thing.
It's not because it can't, it's just because, well, you know, it's just not gonna.
I gotcha, I gotcha.
Well, as far as... We are just so Wii-centric today, aren't we?
It also gave me an excuse to say Wii-centric.
It's the hugest thing in gaming right now.
When we get into Part B, we'll have some non-Wii stuff, but we've got to get this out.
I just said that so that I could use Wii-centric in a sentence.
Cute.
But regarding more Wii games, actually, they have announced...
Resident Evil game for the Wii titled Biohazard Umbrella Chronicles.
It's produced by Masachika Kawata who was also the one who ported RE4 to the PlayStation 2.
I have to make this crack.
Resident Weevil.
Resident Weevil.
Go to hell!
And take your toilet paper joke book with you.
It survived for this long.
Resident Weevil God Capcom was saying that they were supposed to combine the gaming experience and atmosphere but involve the Wii control system with it they're still not leaving any details it's still saying it's an action game still is going to use the WiiCon but they're not really giving any more detail however another game that we did get some detail on was Forever Blue which is a diving game
that will be coming out for Wii.
That sounds interesting.
I love those little quirky games.
Now, you know, Resident Evil 4 was badass on the GameCube and was really like the last kick in the butt that system had, I mean, in the right direction.
So what do you think?
Is Resident Evil Wii going to be like the holy crap, Nintendo's not just cutesy things type game?
I have a feeling it's going to do that.
There's also another game that was mentioned.
Hajime Tano Wii, which means starting out with Wii.
It's supposed to be one of the launch titles.
And it's supposed to be a bunch of mini-games with the duck hunt.
Are you guys getting used to that name now?
Wii?
I think it's cute.
I don't know.
I think it's the right thing.
I think Nintendo's making a lot of smart decisions here.
What was it that I said months ago?
What?
The whole point of advertising, when you come up with a name for something, you need something memorable, something that people are going to talk about.
Something simple.
And it fits all three.
And boy, the internet would not shut up about Wii.
Check any game blog or major gaming site or little gaming site and it was Wii, Wii, Wii.
Unless, you know, it was an Xbox or Sony site.
It was all about the Wii all this week.
There is rarely such a thing as bad press.
I always say rarely, not ever.
Sonya and E3
Thanks for watching!
I'm sure Charum's going to yell it out.
I want to say December 8th, for some reason it sticks out of my mind.
I don't know why.
Maybe that's because it was the Europe launch.
I don't know.
But anyway, what's interesting is that there's a pretty big difference between the GameCube version and the Wii version of Twilight Princess, and that is how Link is holding his sword.
Miyamoto stated that Link was initially supposed to have a left-handed sword in the Wii version of Twilight Princess, but he has that in the GameCube version, and they changed it so that he uses a sword in the right hand on the Wii because of the fact that most people are right-handed.
Well,
I always thought it was very strange having Link be left-handed anyway because isn't it in Japan it's sort of a thing where a lot of parents will train their children to be right-handed.
Being left-handed is very, I guess, considered not very normal.
Chatroom's all yelling December 11th, by the way.
Thank you, Chatroom.
Why can't they make Tingle less gay then?
If they can teach Link to use the other hand.
Hey, Tingle ain't coming out here.
I can say this because
I think on GayGamer.net, I want to say, was the site.
They're starting a petition right now to get Tingle out over here, because right now it's not planned for release over here.
The Tingle Adventure.
That uber gay guy in the, well, at least it's, you know, we all think he is, in that GameCube Four Swords Adventures.
No, actually, he flies by on a balloon and goes, oh!
and drops rupees on him.
Well, he was actually in Wind Waker.
Oh, that's right.
Alright, thank you.
I just remember him from Four Swords.
I'm going to have to import that because I like... Yeah.
You like to feel a little tingle?
No, I just like... I like the gay.
Anyway, speaking of... No, I'm sorry, not speaking of... The interface for the Wii, we've got some very interesting things going on.
There is...
Excuse me as I die over here.
There is going to be, it's actually based on Opera for their web browser.
There's a weather channel, a news channel, and then there's one called me channel.
M-I-I for those who haven't got the joke yet.
with the me channel you can use that to customize your avatar and also your avatar will show up in the various demos you can actually store everything on your Wii remote so you will actually be taking your Wii remote to other people's houses and play which I've been listening to some other podcasts kind of not getting that
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
There actually, if anyone is interested, there are videos up on Eurogamer.net, linked over from Eurogamer TV, that give demonstrations of how these various screens and channels are going to work on the Wii.
So I recommend checking those out.
Very cool.
And I know I saw some on Wii.com, too.
Oh, yeah.
Some good stuff, too.
I want to point out this comment, and I know I'm not supposed to say these words because they were banned, but it's a funny comment.
Sioran108 in our chatroom says Tingle gets more guys than G4 in regards to Tingle.
As Jamie mentioned earlier, there's a brand new Wii game which roughly translates to my first Wii.
The game's actually going to be bundled with a Wiimote and
It will be, yes, my first Wii.
Everybody poops!
No, no, that's translated that wrong.
It says starting with Wii.
Starting with Wii.
Starting with Wii, and then you go to poo.
Okay, anyways.
So, yeah, it's going to be... Wii is number one!
It's going to be bundled... Poo is number two!
It's going to be bundled... I'm glad we got that out of our system.
...together for 4,800 yen, making it cheaper than the standard controller, which would be 5,800 yen.
So that's actually kind of cool.
And it's set for the Japanese release on December 2nd.
And we'll include, of course, mini-games designed to make players familiar with the Wii remote controls, including pinball, table hockey, and pool, simple point-and-click shooting games, and other games that are modeled after the demos shown at E3 and
including a minigame where you move your Mii caricature around a city block.
So, interesting.
Alright.
Now, one thing that the Wii is going to be able to do that is kind of interesting, and it's kind of interesting that Xbox 360 doesn't do this, and I don't know if PlayStation has plans to do this, but that's surfing the web.
And I can see where Xbox 360 doesn't do this, because they want you to go use Windows on your PC to go, you know, surf the internet, but Nintendo, you know, they don't have a PC stake, so they say, fuck that, you're going to surf the web on our, uh,
www.darksakura.com
No idea why they're doing it that way.
I thought at first when I read this, this meant that the browser wasn't going to be out until June of next year, but that's not what the internet seems to be reporting right now.
It seems to be saying that, yeah, the Opera browser will be there, and you can download it free, but in June of next year, you're going to have to pay for it.
So, I guess a bonus incentive to early adopters of the Wii?
I guess.
The other thing, too, is, I mean, it's probably not that expensive to develop the Opera browser in the sense that it's normally free anyways.
That's probably why they're charging after.
It's kind of like the whole thing that they did with Texas Hold'em, where it's free for 48 hours.
Yeah, but Texas Hold'em was free for two days.
This is going to be free for about seven months.
Well, you know, not a lot of people are going to be really jumping to download the browser.
Because, I mean, if you think about it, to browse the internet, you really got to have a wireless setup and all that stuff.
For the Wii, so... Well, wait, but isn't the Wii supposed to have the wireless thing built into it, just like your DS, so that all you have to have is a wireless router in your house and it'll go?
Exactly, but still, though, I mean, not a lot of people have that, I would think.
Do you think people without wireless internet are going to be screwed, or do you think there'll be a dongle like there was for DS?
No, there's going to be a USB type of thing.
Same that they had with the DS.
That's what I figured.
Well, speaking of things that are screwed up... Monkey Ball.
Okay.
Okay.
Monkey Ball is just one of those crazy games that's out there.
And of course, as everyone knows by now, there is a Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz that will be out on the Wii.
But they're introducing two new characters, one called Yan Yan and one called Doctor.
Yan Yan is a female monkey.
And Yan Yan is a doctor.
Sorry, Doctor is an older monkey with a past steeped in mystery due to his acute case of amnesia.
That's a quote.
Is his name Dr. Seuss?
He just says Doctor.
And in my head, I'm a Doctor Who fangirl, so every time I see Doctor, I think, David Tennant?
No!
Now I have this image of David Tennant dressed as a monkey in my head.
I can't.
And now I need to wash my brain.
David Tennant's hot, but anyway.
Okie dokie.
So is Billy Piper.
But back to the story.
There's also, each of these characters are going to have different strengths and weaknesses, things that affect acceleration, speed, jumping, also the weight and size of the ball that they are in.
is going to affect how it's played.
Actually, you use the ball in different ways.
You can flick the remote.
You can press a button.
Different things that you do with the remote are going to affect how the balls move.
And there's also a bunch of mini-games.
It will be out on December 2nd in Japan.
Sorry, the grade schooler in me is using the Wii to make your balls move.
It's just too much for me.
It will be a launch game.
So, in all territories I just want to say some chat comments real quick PooEater on the Opera Story in our chatroom says Why would you want the internet on your console which has to run from your computer's internet connection?
I don't know, there's something to be said about multiple browser windows Maybe mom wants one browsing window and you want one, I don't know And also, I mean, browsing from your couch and PORN!
Come on!
Oh, I can't wait to put porn on my Wii
Raven's Dolphin wanted to correct me and say that PlayStation 3 does indeed have a browser in it.
Thank you.
I couldn't remember.
I figured as much because PSP has one, but I couldn't remember for sure.
Anyway, speaking of the browser, they are testing the online service, or I should say it's rumored that they are beta testing the online service right now.
I don't know how reputable this is, but this is according to a poster on the MacRumorsForum.com.
I have problems with that right there.
Anyways, who has fairly reputable history when it comes to Nintendo-related information.
Why he's posting on Mac... Whatever, anyways.
Saying that the beta test is running from September 18th until October 23rd, and the test will be covering the Wii Connect 24, Virtual Console, and other online features.
Right.
Okay, so they're beta testing the online service.
Great.
You know, that's something that they need to do.
Since, you know, the console is coming out pretty soon.
What?
Nothing.
I'm a really Mac fangirl in the house.
No, that's not true.
I like Macs.
I have a Mac.
I'm getting my... Oh, did you see the 24-inch iMacs?
The bigger the better.
Why do you need something that big?
For art.
I'm being told that that's not a rumor and that's the truth, apparently.
They're 24-inch widescreen iMacs.
My internet penis knows no bounds.
Moving on, another question that still is up for debate right now.
We have not really gotten a clear answer on this story, and it has to do with the region-free.
Is the damn thing going to be region-free or not?
And it seems to be that it's America versus the rest of the world.
I mean Nintendo of America versus Nintendo of the rest of the world.
Debating on whether the damn thing is going to be region free or not.
Basically what happened is that, okay, Perrin Kaplan, who's the VP of Marketing and Corporate Affairs, she said that yes, like the Nintendo DS, the Wii is going to be free.
But then, I believe some guy from Europe said that it is not going to be region free.
So, and then, I guess to further say what Perrin was saying is that she was saying, well, first party games will be region free, but we'll leave it up to the third party folks what they want to do.
So...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and potentially regionless third party titles was indeed correct.
The Wii will be region free.
So Nintendo of America is convinced the damn thing is going to be region free.
So I don't know why the rest of the world isn't on the same page.
I hope so because I want to get Wii Play and my first Wii.
And if something like, you know, Oendan comes out for the Wii, you damn well better believe I want that shit.
But you know what though?
I have a feeling that even if it's not, we're going to get something like what came out on the GameCube.
What was it called?
The thing that basically overrode the region thing and swapped out the disc.
Oh, that whole swap trick.
Use little hacks to do it.
Especially if Nintendo's letting you on the internet with their console.
You know what a huge fucking hole that's going to be, I bet, to hackers?
The whole thing about Nintendo...
All of their systems have been the easiest to play imports on.
For Super Famicom games, all you needed to do was find an old Gyromite.
Not for Super Famicom, but for Famicom, you needed an old Gyromite and you could plug it in.
or with the Super Nintendo, you break out two little tabs, plug it in.
With the Nintendo 64, they sold actually a little tool that you could unscrew and then you pop another tab, put it in.
Those were all physical lockouts until they started moving to digital format.
And then with that, it was still something as easy as loading a code.
It was like the Dreamcast, how easy that was.
And then I have a feeling that even if they go back and it's all region coded, they're still going to have some way to bypass that.
And I really don't think Nintendo's going to care.
They haven't cared before, really.
Why should they really care?
Bobby Blackwolf's in our chat right now.
He does his own show over on allgames.com.
I'm sure if you've listened to this show for any length of time, you've heard us pimp him before.
He ran the same story on his show tonight, except he was reading Joystick's version of it, and I guess Joystick talked to Nintendo as well, and they told him, no, it's not region free.
So, shit, even with the Nintendo of America, they don't know.
So we won't know until the damn thing comes out, it sounds like.
You know what, though?
I'm still really...
I can't be too upset about that because there's going to be a way.
Yeah, there'll be a way.
Even if Nintendo doesn't do something, even if we don't have a developer do something, there is going to be some importer on the net, the same people who probably figured out how to do the seven swap trick on the old PlayStation, who will figure out a way to play imports.
Well, it's just like the Xbox 360 games.
There are some that come out that are region-free, and then you can import them.
You just won't know until they come out, so...
I guess it's one of those things they didn't think people were going to ask about.
What do you mean you want games from other regions?
What the hell is wrong with you?
They know there are importers there.
I remember paying $125 for the Sailor Moon S fighting game back in 1995.
Because you're fucking sick.
And I mean that with lots of love.
This was when it was brand new and I had to pay import fees.
and I paid for it and I bought it and I played the hell out of it and sold it back used for $60 after two years.
But still, there are people out there who will lay down the money and will do what it takes to get their imports out.
Cool.
Anyways, some of the news that was coming out of Japan was actually a huge list of games that they're going to be getting for the Wii.
I thought there was a lot of stuff that was very interesting in there.
Some of the titles, at least the highlights on there,
some to-be-announced titles, for example.
There's an action game, an action RPG that's being worked on from software.
A baseball game being worked on by Konami Digital Entertainment, so that might be interesting.
Bomberman Land, Smash Bros., which, of course, we knew was coming.
Disaster, also another Nintendo game.
Donkey Kong Tarou Jet Race, which is going to be coming out in 2007.
Dragon Quest...
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, The Crystal Bearer from Square Enix New Fire Emblem game from Nintendo As well as Harry Potter from EA, of course Mario Party 8, not a big surprise there Mario Strikers Charge, which had been previously announced This one I thought was very interesting Music Simulation game, of course a working title from Konami Digital Entertainment So, very interesting there
Super Paper Mario Super Paper Mario Super Paper Mario Super Paper Mario
Pac-Man Carnival One Piece Unlimited Adventure Wii Music Totsugeki Famicom Wars W
I actually do not know what Totokeki means.
Maybe someone in chat knows.
Let me see.
Oh, Advanced Wars.
I'm sorry.
Okay, yeah, so that's what that is.
Good job, Junami.
Yeah, I was thinking, because I was like, that sounds familiar, but... My thought, okay, the Konami music game, just bear with me on this, since it's probably something new for the Wii, I would bet this series is cute enough for Nintendo.
I bet it's going to be some twisted form of poppin' music, but not with the controller like we know it.
It's going to be like a different type of poppin' music.
Theory.
Hi, weird-ass theory for me.
No theory here.
Motion Sensing Controller, music game, Drum Mania.
You think?
Actually, you know, they did have one of the demos at E3 was a drumming sim.
But wasn't, isn't that Wii music thing supposed to be a separate game with the orchestra and that whole thing from Nintendo?
I don't think it has a drumming thing on there.
The Wii music is just the orchestra.
But, um...
You know, I don't know.
Chatroom seems to think it's Parapara.
We're not going to get Parapara.
The whole Parapara thing is so... Wait, wait, wait.
This isn't for us.
It's Japan we're talking about.
That's what I'm saying.
Parapara is pretty much dead in Japan.
It was a fad that lasted for like, what, five years?
Maybe it's something new.
Maybe it's like ganguro dancing or something.
I don't know.
Unfortunately, the ganguro did not die with the Parapara.
Mambo-Gogo?
Mambo-Gogo would be cool.
That would be badass.
But anyway, so... Well...
Speaking of other games, we have coming out for the Virtual Console, Hudson, who loves us so much, will be bringing 30 titles over for Virtual Console.
Some of them will be available at launch.
They haven't listed exactly what.
My speculation is we will be probably getting the Adventure Island series, probably the various Bombermans.
Those are two I definitely think are going to be up there.
And Bonk.
I think I definitely... Well, especially if they're doing TurboGrafx.
You cannot have TurboGrafx without Bonk.
Or Air Zonk.
That's another good one.
This is one that Junomi suggested.
But I still want my Adventure Island.
Well, another company that's talking about games coming over to the Wii.
Actually, this one kind of leaked out from the ESRB ratings board there.
We've got a listing for a bunch of different Wii titles for the Virtual Console, including Altered Beast, Columns, Echo the Dolphin, Golden Axe, Ristar, Sonic the Hedgehog, and ToeJam & Earl.
All of which are getting an E rating.
Oh god, I can't wait to play ToeJam & Earl again.
What do you think, though, about the whole $5, $8, $10 thing?
Do you think that's going to be worth it for those old games?
They didn't really say where Genesis and TurboGrafx fits into that, though.
They just said, you know, 500 points for the old games, 800 for the SNES, and 1,000 for the later ones, Nintendo 64.
You know, I do, though, have to second something that was mentioned in the chat room.
Bob Coffee said we need to get Dracula X. All right.
We have to get one of our biggest Nintendo fans on the Skype line right now because he's dying to comment on some of this because he knows a few things that we don't and we're going to see what we can get out of him here on the show.
DMN, are you on the line?
Yeah, you got your $20 bills out?
Why, are you going to dance?
Maybe.
Did you dress up for this phone call?
Wait, what?
Did you dress up for this phone call?
He's dressed sexy for episode 200.
I'm actually not wearing any clothes right now.
D.M.N., I know you're dying to comment on this.
What do you think about all this news this week?
And now you can actually talk about some of the things you couldn't before, I'm sure.
Yeah, a few things.
One of the things I want to say is this is the most excited I've been for a console launch since about Nintendo 64.
I would agree with that, except I would go as far back to say I have not been this excited about a console at launch, keeping those words in mind, at launch, since Super Nintendo.
Yeah, that's another one.
What I want to say about the Wii is, you know, having had a chance to dabble playing it a little bit, we did have a little demo thing over the week for all Nintendo employees.
It's incredibly fun.
Elebits, looks amazing.
Got a chance to try out a demo of WarioWare, which is amazing.
It's really fun.
What else can I... Madden 07, I got to play like a couple plays of that, and that may be the most fun anybody will have with a sim sports game ever.
Are you biased because you're on Reggie's payroll?
No.
No?
No.
Swear to me.
I'm getting a 360 at some point.
I'm just not getting a PS3.
So you're in the Wii 60 camp?
Yes.
All right.
Fair enough.
Well, what else?
Anything else you can tell us about the Wii?
Maybe?
Little bits?
Little hints?
I'm trying to see... I don't want to get you fired, so I understand if no, but... There's not really anything else I can talk about because I know just about as much as you guys do in some aspects.
But there's some things I can't talk about because of obvious reasons.
Right.
Um...
Yeah, that's about it.
Okay.
Alright, well, that's cool.
Well, we'll take your word for it, because you've probably seen the Wii more recently than any of the rest of us, so... Yeah.
So you actually got hands-on with Elebits?
Because I saw it at the Konami thing, but I didn't get to play it, really, because all the Corpcasts were hogging the shit out of it, and we weren't really able to get on it.
I will say, right here and now, it will be a Katamari Damacy killer.
Oh, well, I don't know about that.
I don't know about that.
I will put money on that with you, Rob.
Loki, you saw this, too?
You think Elebits is the Katamari killer?
I don't think so.
No.
No.
I don't think so.
It's fun.
It's going to appeal to the same type of people.
Yeah, I think it's going to appeal to the same crowd, but I don't think it'll sell nearly as many copies.
Now, they do need to release Katamari for it, though.
They do.
Yeah, it'll be interesting.
But it won't be the same guy, because he said he's not doing any more Katamari.
I guess that's true.
Who cares?
Just port it.
What makes you think that Elebits is a Katamari killer?
Just how incredibly fun it was.
It was easy to just pick up and play.
It took me maybe 30 seconds just to get used to what I was doing, and it was clockwork from there.
It felt just as fun as a Katamari game and just as simple.
Isn't that how most Wii games are designed, though, that you just kind of pick it up and go?
Yeah, absolutely.
Basically, for those who don't know, Elevates is basically a game where, let's say you're playing Half-Life 2 in just a random part of the neighborhood, and the only thing you have is the gravity gun.
That's pretty much what it is.
Hmm.
Interesting.
Will I be able to sell a Wii to my mom?
If you want.
I mean, is this really the type of console that's going to appeal to everyone, you think?
Oh, absolutely.
I was actually telling my own mother about it, who absolutely loves video games, and she actually even seemed interested in trying it when I bought it.
I think that this is the direction that gaming needs to go.
We need to
Be more a part of the game rather than, you know, I don't want top-notch graphics.
I don't want incredibly difficult controls.
I just want a game I can pick up and play and enjoy and have fun with.
Okay, interesting.
And that's why we're not seeing as much of the 360, and from what Sony's doing, it's just not looking like it.
All right.
But what do you think might happen with Sony in a year?
Because remember, the PlayStation and PlayStation 2 launches, I think for people who play the same type of games we do, we're not really in the we buy Madden games the day they come out camp.
And granted, there's a great fan base for that, and I'm not knocking that if that's what you're into.
But do you think that maybe for us who are more of the, you know, we like to play quirky music games and Japanese RPGs camp, do you think that Sony might win us over in a year?
Because I truly believe it right now that Sony may be able to shnagle a price drop and some great games in a year that, you know, don't count PS3 out.
I'm trying to be as open-minded as possible about this.
I definitely wouldn't count Sony out.
It's just the price that's killing them.
I think if they release a Final Fantasy and a Kingdom Hearts, yeah, absolutely.
Those are going to sell PS3s.
All right.
I know tons of people who, if Kingdom Hearts 3 comes out, they will drop what they're doing and go buy a PS3.
Chris?
Chris is nodding her head.
That's me.
That's me.
All right.
DMM, we've got to let you go because we've got to get to our next round of DDR sneak peeks.
But thanks so much for calling in.
We appreciate it.
Oh, one more thing.
Okay.
One more thing.
Yes?
While we're talking about the Wii, you all need to listen to Orange Lounge Radio on November the 19th because I will be in studio with a Wii to give to somebody.
And the other thing, since he couldn't share some info about the Wii, I figured I could.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Thanks so much.
You're a true fan, DMM.
We love you.
All right.
Take care, guys.
Have a good one, buddy.
Thanks.
Bye.
What do you know on release dates?
Well, as we know, there's only really two Nintendo first-party titles that are launching with Wii in the United States, including Excite Truck and, of course, Zelda Twilight Princess.
However, shortly afterwards, we will be getting the next in first-party games, which will be WarioWare Smooth Moves, which is coming to us on January 16, 2007.
The other thing which is very interesting, as I mentioned before, Sonic the Secret of the Rings, of course not a launch title, also confirmed by the launch games that were coming out.
It is in the launch window, I guess, but it's coming out March 7th, 2007.
So lots of big stuff coming from Sega in March, and I'll get into that a little bit later.
And of course, Super Paper Mario, delayed on the GameCube until the 15th of December.
possibly on the Wii in the United States.
I don't know.
Kind of foggy on that.
Interesting.
All right.
Well, I think that about covers all the Wii news we wanted to do tonight.
So now I want to go around to everybody, our guests included, and I want to ask you guys, what do you think now after all this news?
Are you sold on the Wii?
Were you disappointed with the news you heard this week?
Or are you happy with the news you heard this week?
Is Nintendo going to win the next round of the console wars?
What do you think?
We'll start it off with Drew.
Drew Nami, what do you think?
Personally, I've been sold on the Wii since the E3 announcements, but I know there's a lot of anti-Nintendo people out there.
Despite all that, I think Nintendo's got the routine down pat.
Do one thing, do it really well, do it with innovation.
I think they're definitely going to score second, if not first, in the console wars for this generation.
Loki.
The only disappointment I have is that it's not coming out sooner.
The price is fine, because I figured that's about the price I was going to pay for it anyways.
And I know I've got to buy lots of accessories for it, because I take this thing to work, I play with my friends, and I've got to have enough controllers for everybody, because they're broke asses.
So, you know, that's fine.
The only thing I'm just worried about is I want to make sure I get one on launch.
That's my only concern right now, and I'm trying to cover my bases with that.
And I'm really hoping that they, you know, I do like what they've got coming out as far as games and stuff.
I think we're going to see a lot of really cool, innovative things with it.
I'm very interested to see these Wii channels.
I don't really give a crap about the news too much, but, you know, some of the stuff's pretty cool, like the photo channel.
It's pretty neat.
All right.
Some quick chat comments, then we'll get Chris's feedback.
Knights in our chat says, The two weeks when Gears of War, the PS3, and the Wii come out, I will feel sorry for everyone at GameStop and EB Games.
Anush in our chat says, I think Sony is going to make it again, but I have no problem with Nintendo.
I'll buy a Wii, too, but Sony comes before Microsoft for me.
Chris, what are your thoughts?
You know what?
I don't really get sold on games or the systems that they come with too easily.
It sounds cool, but I don't know if I'm going to get one at launch.
Just because I'm really picky about the games that I do have.
Just getting the PS2, which is the only one I've got so far, and some Game Boys.
Even that, that took Kingdom Hearts to go get.
It's got to be a good game for me to go get it, so I probably won't get it at launch.
But it sounds really good, and I'm sure you're going to hear Megzi talk about it constantly, so I'll get enough news from it.
Here's the thing, my big thing about the Wii...
The vibe I get from the Wii is the same vibe I get from thinking about playing Castle Crashers or old arcade games like the four-player coin-op games.
That kind of vibe where it's fun.
You have your friends over, you put some chips on the table or something, and you all play a fun game together.
That's the kind of vibe I get from it.
All right.
Quick chat comment, then we'll get my thoughts, and then DarkSakura.
Bob Coffee says in our chat, I think Nintendo's got it.
Sony's just making too many mistakes.
The real battle will be here in North America.
My thoughts.
You know, not since the original 8-bit Nintendo has a word...
Thanks for watching!
so that, you know, it's going to appeal to everyone.
I mean, you can just pick this thing up and go.
I do know people that are turned off by Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 because it's just, you know, too many buttons.
Too damn many buttons.
Too much to do.
And I think this is going to be the one that sells it to the families.
I think for the hardcore of hardcore gamers, there's another battle that's going to be fought there between 360 and PS3.
But I think this is what Nintendo wants.
Nintendo is trying to go after the casual gamer and I think they're going to get it.
And I think the Wii, if not
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But as long as we consistently are getting new games that keep our interest, I think we've got the potential to do amazingly.
DarkSakura, your thoughts?
First of all, just to go back to what you were saying about Xerox, I remember there being an ad back in the 80s where Xerox would say, this is not a generic.
Please don't use this as a generic.
Nintendo is on its way to having their entire corporate name being used as a generic term for games.
In terms of business, that hurts them.
So I disagree with that, just after what I've studied in business law.
But I do agree, though, that they have been the big innovators.
I wanted a Wii when it was a revolution.
There's never been a doubt that if Nintendo puts out a system, I am going to own it.
So, that's all I... You know, Nintendo could put out a cardboard box and call it the Pooh, and I would buy it.
Jamie, you're gullible.
Have I ever told you that?
I am not.
If it's Nintendo, it's going to be good.
They've always put out quality products.
Pooh is not good!
Alright.
It was an example.
I didn't mean to buy Pooh.
Alright, well those are our opinions.
Take them or leave them.
We'd love to hear your opinions as well, not only in our chat room, but at our email bag.

DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and tonight we're going to debut one of these power courses for you right now.
This one is from DDR Ultramix 4.
It is power course number 2.
It's the Stargaze mix by DJ Nagi.
Enjoy.
Listen to the words I'm saying, baby I found the ghost and it keeps me hanging
Thank you for watching!
Thanks for watching!
from DDR Ultramix 4 here on Orange Lounge Radio.
That is one of the new power courses.
That's power course number two as mixed by DJ Nagi, the Stargaze mix here on Orange Lounge Radio.
Now, I know a lot of you guys are dying to know what songs are in that list.
I want to know what the songs are.
Well, you'll find out when the game's released.
But in the meantime, you'll just have to speculate away.
And I'm sure if you play DDR Ultramix 2, you won't have a hard time figuring out one of the songs in there at least.
But as far as the rest of it goes, we're supposed to keep a lid on it.
Sorry guys, have fun.
Alright, anyway, we're going to move on and, well, I don't know.
You think we ought to do some more?
Sure.
Alright, look, here.
Here.
Let's do some clips from some other courses as well, because I don't want to leave out DDR Universe, because DDR Universe has some non-stops as well, so we've got to show them a little love.
But we are a little pressed for time, so we're going to do some clips.
So here's a clip of one of the non-stops from DDR Universe.
This is the Acid Tech Mix, also by DJ Nagi here on Orange Lounge Radio.
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Alright, we've got to cut it off.
We can't play too much or Konami Hawaii is going to get mad at us.
But here on Orange Launch Radio, that was from DDR Universe, a clip of Power Chorus number one.
And that is called the Acid Tech Mix by DJ Nagi.
You know, DJ Nagi is awesome and all, but we've got to play someone else, I think.
We need to do at least one more chorus so we can play someone else and show a different mixing style.
Wouldn't you agree?
Do you think they'd care if we played one more?
No.
Alright, well...
We'll do one more clip.
That's another course from DDR Ultramix 4.
This is the Steppin' Out Mix by Stillwind, a little clip so you can check out someone else's mixing skills here on the DDR Sneak Peeks.
Here on Orange Lounge Radio.
Thank you for watching!
Alright, we gotta turn it off, or else Konami's gonna write us some hate mail, and I don't wanna screw the rest of the DDR Sneak Peeks, but that was a look there at the Steppin' Out mix by Stillwind from DDR Ultramix 4, and dude, he mixed like happy hardcore into jazz swing 20s music there, I mean...
These courses are going to be nuts.
So that's just a taste of what's to come.
We will continue the DDR sneak peeks next week.
We're going to go back and look at two new tracks from DDR Ultramix 4 and two new tracks from DDR Universe.
And that will be next week, episode 201 of Orange Lounge Radio.
We're about ready to go to DDR, I'm sorry, OLR Part B here pretty soon.
Loki, you want to make a quick comment on something you thought was funny about the Supernova VRare, which came out this week?
Yeah, there's actually some interesting stuff about it.
The first thing, of course, the first track is actually a song called
L.E.F.
Which also, there's an artist in DDR called System SF, which created a song called, um, oh god, Feelings Won't Fade, which ripped off a System F song called Out of the Blue, which I thought that was very ironic.
Well, I guess they kissed and made up, and, you know, imitation is the highest form of flattery, isn't that what they say?
This is a photocopy of the song, it is that close, but, uh, all right.
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
