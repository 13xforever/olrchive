0	6000	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
6000	15000	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15000	20000	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20000	28000	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 201 for this September the 24th of 2006.
28000	34000	And we've got a case of the giggles, sorry about that, but that's part of our live segment that you can only hear when you listen to us live.
34000	40000	Sorry podcast fans, we have to do something special for the live listeners, whether it be here on orangeloungeradio.com or allgames.com.
40000	45000	Anyway, we're going to get back into the news now, however, and I'm going to start off this segment of news.
45000	50000	Last week we had a crap load of Wii news, and we have a wee bit of Wii news this week,
50000	53000	and one of them is a country launch we didn't get to last week,
53000	57000	but here at Orange Lounge Radio we want to recognize all the countries around the world that do gaming.
57000	59000	One of them is New Zealand.
59000	64000	New Zealand has had their Wii launch date revealed and some of the details.
64000	67000	The console will be coming to New Zealand on December 7th.
67000	70000	Wii Sports will be a pack-in game, just like here in the US.
70000	80000	It will cost $499 New Zealand dollars, which translates to about 261 euros, 330 American dollars.
80000	85000	So, by the way, New Zealand is actually having to pay a little bit more than Australia for that.
85000	87000	Doh. Doh.
87000	91000	But at least you're getting the console relatively early and not getting the shaft on release date,
91000	94000	so, you know, at least that's some consolation, I hope?
94000	95000	I guess.
95000	100000	Does it just strike me funny that consolation is almost a pun?
100000	102000	Consolation, yeah.
102000	108000	Anyways, some of the news we actually talked about a while back was how the Wii wasn't going to have a digital audio out port,
108000	113000	and we were wondering why that, you know, I think I made the point that that wasn't really important.
113000	119000	Well, in the case now, it really isn't important because we found out that only,
119000	124000	that we will only be supporting Dolby Pro Logic 2 technology.
124000	131000	So, you know, you can just use your standard, you know, red and white audio cables for that kind of stuff.
131000	136000	But I guess it's cool that it has some sort of quasi-surround sound to it.
136000	140000	I mean, not that it really needs too much since it has, you know, the speaker and the controller,
140000	145000	which I guess that they could use for some semi-surround sound, but whatever.
145000	150000	I mean, it's not a surprise when the game isn't, you know, HD, you know, really anyways.
150000	153000	Maybe it's just me, and let me go out here on a limb,
153000	157000	and I'm sure to piss somebody off with this, you know, thing I'm about to say, but whatever.
157000	158000	It's my view.
158000	165000	I don't really get all like, oh, gosh, the sound in this game was so crystal clear, amazing.
165000	174000	Wow, when I shot that guy in the face, I could really hear that in full, you know, 31.11 surround super uber Dolby sound or whatever.
174000	179000	Maybe that's just because I have a pretty shitty surround system in my house, like it's probably like 10 years old, it's old.
179000	187000	But I don't, like, I'm more big on what's the music and, you know, the stuff that you don't have to have the huge boom systems for.
187000	191000	You don't really need this kind of stuff to be fully immersed into the game anyways.
191000	192000	No, I disagree.
192000	193000	Okay, please.
193000	196000	After having played games in surround sound?
196000	202000	Oh, hell yeah, especially for anything that's scary where you, those little side noises are going to,
202000	209000	especially since you've got your speaker in the Wii controller, having that full surround sound.
209000	215000	Okay, do you want to go see your movie in just mono, or do you want to see it in surround sound?
215000	216000	Well, I mean, it depends.
216000	219000	If I'm watching a comedy, it doesn't really matter.
219000	224000	If you have the capability to play it in surround sound, don't you want the full effect?
224000	228000	It is kind of weird, though, that it does have a, you know, a speaker in the controller, you know,
228000	234000	because they're trying to make it more kind of immersive, and yet they're not supporting, like, immersive sound.
234000	240000	I don't know, I just, let me phrase it this way, I've just, I've never had a crappy sound system take the game experience away from me, I guess.
240000	243000	Maybe I've just played the wrong games on those uber surround systems.
243000	248000	Like, I really haven't played a lot of survival horror on those systems, so maybe I'm just not playing the right games, I don't know.
248000	249000	I don't know.
249000	250000	It could be the game.
250000	260000	Well, if it isn't much of a surprise, of course, the same info came out this week that Dolby is also going to be providing the sound technology for the PlayStation 3,
260000	266000	including Dolby Digital's 5.1 surround, and you better believe that they're going to be pushing this crap.
266000	277000	Sony will also be supporting Dolby's TrueHD sound for decoding up to 7.1 channels for playback of movie titles in the Blu-ray Disc format and probably games.
277000	281000	So, I think that's kind of interesting, you know, that they're supporting this technology.
281000	292000	They're probably going to be pushing those wonderful Sony 7.1 systems now so you can get your 7.1 system and your 1080p, you know, plasma screen TV and spend uber money on stuff that you probably don't need.
292000	296000	Screw that, if you want something good, get a Harman Kardon and Bose surround speakers.
296000	298000	No contest.
298000	300000	That's what we've got in my house.
300000	313000	Anyway, something that actually is cool for some if you manage to get in on it and not so cool for others, Amazon has sold out of pre-orders for the Wii.
313000	315000	Yep. No more.
315000	318000	So, go to your GameStop and wait until they do pre-orders.
318000	321000	Well, how long was that up? An hour? Two hours?
321000	323000	We probably had to shut that off pretty quick.
323000	328000	It wasn't. It was about a couple of hours, and the reason why they stopped pre-orders is because they don't have their allocations yet.
328000	332000	They all know what they're getting, so they're going to restart pre-orders once they figure that out.
332000	336000	But it was kind of an error, I guess, on taking the pre-orders right now.
336000	341000	Well, I can tell you right now, at least as far as I've last asked, GameStop's not taking pre-orders on them yet.
341000	343000	Yeah, I've been calling them every day.
343000	346000	I ask my husband every day.
346000	348000	Do they know you by name when you call them?
348000	356000	No, they don't, but I always preface the call with, I'm sorry to ask this, but, you know, because I'm sure they get to call like 700 calls.
356000	360000	Don't you think news will hit the internet when they're going to start taking pre-orders?
360000	366000	Yeah, but I want to know first because I don't want to hear it from second hand because then people already know and they're already there.
366000	369000	I'd rather call them right when they open up and say, hey, are you taking pre-orders?
369000	371000	Okay, I'll tell you this.
371000	377000	As soon as I find out when GameStop is taking pre-orders, we will have an announcement.
377000	380000	So, as soon as I can actually say something.
380000	383000	You think we'll be able to beat some of the big boys to it? I don't know.
383000	384000	Maybe.
384000	385000	We'll see. All right.
385000	387000	As soon as I hear all the drama that goes on.
387000	389000	Oh, you should share some of that drama with us.
389000	391000	I can't share some of the drama.
391000	393000	Damn, what kind of radio is that?
393000	394000	All right.
394000	399000	Well, one thing that's causing a little bit of drama, as you know, last week we talked about, oh, the Wii is region-free.
399000	401000	Oh, it's not region-free.
401000	402000	It's free. It's not free.
402000	403000	Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.
403000	408000	Well, it looks like there are plenty more votes for not region-free.
408000	418000	In fact, representatives from Nintendo of America confirmed to 1UP.com earlier this week that the Wii will be region-encoded by territory.
418000	420000	Wah, wah.
420000	427000	Which means, unfortunately, if you want to play Japanese Wii games, you will have to purchase a Japanese Wii or wait for a hack.
427000	428000	It will be there.
428000	432000	It will either be a physical one or something as simple as a disc.
432000	440000	Because it seems to me that if this is like a last-minute decision by them, that it's going to be something half-assed for the region protection.
440000	441000	I don't see.
441000	448000	I really don't see why they're putting so much effort into it since they've never really given half a crap before because it's always been something easy.
448000	457000	And, anyway, Nintendo, if you're listening, Reggie, if you're listening to our podcast, why?
457000	458000	You know what?
458000	466000	And here's evidence, if Nintendo is listening to this, here's evidence that region-free will work.
466000	470000	Elite Beat Agents, I will bet you anything that game sells like hotcakes.
470000	471000	Why?
471000	477000	Because so many people purchased the import version and have let their friends play it that I bet that game is going to sell like crazy.
477000	482000	Wouldn't have happened if you didn't have the region-free DS.
482000	483000	That wouldn't have happened.
483000	486000	I bet you Elite Beat Agents possibly wouldn't have even come out here.
486000	499000	It would make more sense to have the universal launch, have the same games come out except for the really crappy American-centered games and the really quirky Japanese-centered games.
499000	505000	I think that region coding is pretty much going to shoot them in the ass.
505000	506000	It hasn't worked yet.
506000	510000	It's interesting because some folks in the chat room are saying, you know what?
510000	511000	I still don't believe it.
511000	518000	You know, so what if this big, foofy website called their rep at Nintendo?
518000	520000	Reps have been wrong before.
520000	521000	Interesting.
521000	527000	So I guess there is a little bit of hope that perhaps this system could possibly still be region-free.
527000	528000	I hope so.
528000	530000	Reggie, if you're listening, I love you, dude.
530000	532000	Please make it region-free.
532000	537000	I don't think, well, it would be nice, but I don't think they will.
537000	538000	I don't know.
538000	539000	We'll see.
539000	546000	But anyways, one thing I am hoping to see on the Wii would be Grand Theft Auto.
546000	551000	And now the news coming out that Take-Two is planning on bringing M-rated games to the Wii.
551000	559000	That makes me happy because what are they known for as far as, you know, big games?
559000	561000	Cutesy, Ellabits, and Pokemon.
561000	562000	No, no, no.
562000	563000	It's Grand Theft Auto.
563000	564000	Oh, wait.
564000	565000	No, I'm sorry.
565000	566000	I thought you were talking about Nintendo.
566000	567000	Nintendo is usually known for the Cutesy games.
567000	571000	There is nothing I want more in this world to be able to beat a hooker with a Wiimote.
571000	574000	That is going to be the...
574000	576000	Beat me to it.
576000	580000	I will be able to die after doing that.
580000	582000	I probably will.
582000	585000	What they need to add is like, you know, the pimp slap with the Wiimote.
585000	587000	I mean, it will be just awesome.
587000	590000	I cannot wait for, you know, them to actually put out something.
590000	595000	Although they're probably going to bring out fucking table tennis for the...
595000	596000	Hey, now wait a minute.
596000	598000	Table tennis with the Wii-Con could be pretty rad.
598000	600000	Don't knock it until you've tried it.
600000	603000	That might be kind of fun.
603000	608000	I want table tennis extreme where I can take off people's heads with the fucking ball.
608000	609000	That'd be cool.
609000	611000	We need freaking wire work ping pong.
611000	612000	It reminds me of...
612000	616000	Or you could do clips and shit with the ball.
616000	617000	I don't know.
617000	622000	But, you know, I'm glad at least they're opening it up for Emorata Games to hopefully remove
622000	627000	this kind of, you know, impression that Nintendo was only for kids.
627000	631000	Because I think this console will be a lot better if they just get past that
631000	634000	and publishers realize, okay, this is going to appeal to everybody.
634000	638000	Including people that like to beat hookers with a stick.
638000	640000	GS191 in our chat room says,
640000	644000	Oh great, hot coffee mod with Wiimote functionality.
644000	645000	What do you do?
645000	647000	Stroke the Wiimote?
647000	648000	Does it have a sensor on the side?
648000	650000	I don't think it has a sensor for that.
650000	653000	No, they'll have an attachment.
653000	656000	They'll have, like, the dildo attachment.
656000	658000	Gross!
658000	660000	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
660000	664000	I'm sorry, after the movie we saw last night, I'm not even going to go there.
664000	667000	I took Jamie to see a very perverse movie last night.
667000	670000	That's all we'll say.
670000	676000	Let's change our tone here a little bit because this room's getting a little bit too giggly for me.
676000	678000	And I think we need to bring on some anger.
678000	680000	What do you think, DarkSakura?
680000	682000	That's right, here it comes.
692000	694000	My first F.U. of the week.
694000	697000	It's actually a very serious matter.
697000	704000	I found out today that my cousin-in-law died from AIDS.
704000	709000	He developed pneumonia, fell into a coma two weeks ago, and they pulled life support today.
709000	715000	So I'd just like to say a big F.U. to communicable diseases and people who don't take proper precautions.
715000	725000	I don't know if that was his case, but I'm just saying everybody just please make sure either do it safely or don't do it at all.
725000	728000	Take the proper precautions.
728000	730000	Sorry to hear that.
730000	738000	My F.U. of the week goes to a local church nearby here.
738000	749000	There was a story that came out that basically the city has told them that they cannot have their Christian rock bands come in anymore.
749000	757000	They have this thing going on during the weekend called Club Retro or something like that where they have bands come in and stuff and they worship and whatever crap they do.
757000	764000	So this has been going on for years now and they've received numerous complaints because they are too noisy.
764000	776000	So they have filed basically this thing saying that you're running a nightclub in this church and this area is not zoned for a nightclub.
776000	779000	Plus you are being too noisy and there's too much problem with littering.
779000	781000	You guys are praying too loud.
781000	793000	Exactly and so they are doing this silent protest in front of the church saying that this is unfair that they are taking away their right to worship.
793000	802000	I say they are fucking retarded because they know exactly why they are not able to have these rock bands.
802000	805000	It's because they are running basically like a fucking nightclub.
805000	807000	It's pretty clear cut why.
807000	809000	It's because they are too fucking noisy.
809000	812000	You can worship without having a fucking rock band.
812000	814000	There are churches out there that do that right now.
814000	817000	You don't have to make a lot of noise for God to hear you, okay?
817000	818000	Exactly.
818000	828000	If you are worshiping someone who is omniscient and omnipresent, you can go, thanks God, and God will hear you.
828000	829000	True.
829000	833000	You can raise a joyful noise unto the Lord but don't do it to where your neighbors wake up.
833000	840000	I would like nothing more for them to lose their ability to actually have this rock band that would make me so super happy.
840000	842000	And that's probably what's going to happen.
842000	844000	Go government!
844000	848000	Wow. We should get some emails on that one.
848000	857000	My FU of the week, I was going to do this big old thing but I'm just going to pass this week because I'm mad at a lot of things but it's really none of your business.
857000	859000	So that's it.
859000	863000	And finally, I'm sorry, I had to step in here real quick.
863000	867000	Fuck you Microsoft for your crappy vision camera because I cannot focus this thing for...
867000	869000	I bet you it's just defective.
869000	870000	It's just crap.
870000	871000	Alright.
871000	875000	First of all, this is a gaming related FU.
875000	880000	FU to the fucking stealth segments in Dirge of Cerberus.
880000	886000	I fucking hate it when an otherwise good action game suddenly lapses in this forced stealth segment.
886000	887000	Fuck it.
887000	888000	It sucks.
888000	890000	I hate stealth games.
890000	892000	I will never be good at a stealth game.
892000	895000	So why force me into these stealth segments?
895000	901000	And second of all, FU2, the current arcade management at the local country of complaint.
901000	905000	I went there yesterday with Dark Studios and Chatroom.
905000	911000	They had no less than five machines out of order including In the Groove and several racing games.
911000	918000	They need to get this shit fixed and they don't, it's turning into the next Roseville Golf Land around here.
918000	919000	And it fucking sucks.
919000	921000	Fix your damn machines.
921000	925000	What's the point of running an arcade if half your damn machines are going to be broken?
925000	928000	Flash the lights.
928000	931000	Do you wonder why arcades are dying in America?
931000	933000	You guys make me cry.
933000	935000	Alright.
935000	938000	Let's get back into the gaming news, shall we?
938000	942000	Sure, and we have some news for our UK listeners.
942000	950000	The PAL version of Final Fantasy XII will be out in early 2007.
950000	955000	In the US, of course, the release date is October 31st.
955000	958000	But I think it's funny.
958000	965000	There's a quote by the Square Enix CEO of Europe, John Yamamoto,
965000	969000	saying that it looks set to become one of the crowning glories of PlayStation 2.
969000	971000	That makes me laugh.
971000	974000	Because I don't really think that Final Fantasy XII is all that fantastic.
974000	976000	The battle system is kind of bizarre.
976000	980000	However, you can probably see videos of it online.
980000	988000	You play through as a princess and some dude hanging out with her to try to rescue their home.
988000	991000	It's called Active Battle...
991000	995000	That's the exact same plot of Enchanted Arms right now, actually.
995000	997000	I swear to God, it is.
997000	1002000	It has a real-time exploration and this active dimension battle thing.
1002000	1009000	Basically, you have this big line that comes from you to whatever your target is, and it's really stupid.
1009000	1011000	And then your command screen pops up, and you can do that.
1011000	1013000	You can switch your targets.
1013000	1015000	No, it doesn't work.
1015000	1017000	I liked it, FYI.
1017000	1021000	I tried really hard to give it a chance.
1021000	1023000	And I'm going to get the game.
1023000	1029000	But I also loved Final Fantasy XI, and you thought you were going to go crazy.
1029000	1031000	I gave Final Fantasy XI a chance.
1031000	1032000	You did.
1032000	1034000	Did I make it to level 24 white mage?
1034000	1036000	You did. I know.
1036000	1039000	But you do talk a lot of shit about Final Fantasy XI.
1039000	1041000	At least you tried it. I'll give you that.
1041000	1046000	I have room to talk shit about people who abuse their white mages.
1046000	1049000	White mages are people, too.
1049000	1050000	Heal, please.
1050000	1051000	Fuck you.
1051000	1052000	Heal, please.
1052000	1053000	Port, please.
1053000	1055000	No, no, no, no, no.
1055000	1059000	Because, see, my last party, I got revenge.
1059000	1063000	I let our tank die, and then I killed all the critters because I was subbing black mage.
1063000	1067000	You are a healbot.
1067000	1069000	No, I'm not a healbot.
1069000	1070000	I am a black mage in disguise.
1070000	1071000	Heal, please.
1071000	1072000	Shut up.
1072000	1073000	Regen, please.
1073000	1075000	That is why I will not play Fortnite.
1075000	1078000	That is why I will not play priests in Ragnarok.
1078000	1084000	At least with a priest in Ragnarok, you can do random teleports and drop people in glassheim.
1084000	1086000	Okay, okay.
1086000	1088000	I've got to agree with you on that.
1088000	1093000	When I played Ragnarok Online with you, what did I say to everyone?
1093000	1096000	I don't heal. I'm a battle alkalite.
1096000	1097000	Yep.
1097000	1099000	And now you can actually take monk.
1099000	1102000	Yes, and that fucking kicks ass.
1102000	1104000	I am no one's healbot.
1104000	1109000	I'm going to start playing Ragnarok again because I have my level 50-something assassin.
1109000	1110000	I remember her.
1110000	1111000	Well, have fun.
1111000	1118000	Meanwhile, I'll be playing Final Fantasy XII before all our fans in Europe might have had.
1118000	1119000	Sorry, guys.
1119000	1122000	And I'll still be playing World of Warcraft after my whole turnout wears off.
1122000	1123000	You are a TA.
1123000	1124000	Hold on.
1124000	1125000	Hold on.
1125000	1128000	Did I not say in part A that I went back to WoW?
1128000	1131000	I haven't touched Final Fantasy XI in two weeks, so Shane's very mad at me for that.
1131000	1133000	So, give me that.
1133000	1135000	And then I'm going to play Final Fantasy XII.
1135000	1137000	I'm going to play it before our British friends.
1137000	1140000	Sorry, guys, but I just can't wait any longer.
1140000	1142000	I'll let you all know how it is, though.
1142000	1144000	Yeah, that's it.
1144000	1145000	Well, damn, Rob.
1145000	1148000	Where MMOs are concerned, you can't do anything without pissing someone off, can you?
1148000	1151000	That means you're a bipolar MMO-er.
1151000	1152000	I guess.
1152000	1154000	Not that there's anything wrong with that.
1154000	1155000	Right?
1155000	1156000	All right.
1156000	1157000	Here's...
1157000	1158000	You know what's interesting?
1158000	1163000	I love Final Fantasy so much, yet I still have not watched Final Fantasy VII Advent Children.
1163000	1164000	I don't know why.
1164000	1168000	I just can't frickin' sit down for an hour and a half to watch it.
1168000	1169000	This you must do.
1169000	1174000	Well, anyway, actually, what's been going on is that at a Tokyo game show, Square Enix
1174000	1178000	has revealed a new version of Final Fantasy VII Advent Children with the subtitle,
1178000	1181000	Complete is going to be released.
1181000	1184000	It's kind of like a director's cut.
1184000	1188000	There's going to be a higher resolution coming to Blu-ray, because this is going to be a
1188000	1191000	PlayStation 3, so it's going to be very sexy.
1191000	1192000	Very, very sexy.
1192000	1197000	Square Enix is also going to add some scenes and make some changes to existing scenes.
1197000	1201000	One new scene that was shown during the trailer was that Sephiroth was impaling Cloud and
1201000	1206000	hoisting him over his head while his Mazamune was still embedded inside of him, kind of
1206000	1209000	like Final Fantasy VII on the PlayStation 1.
1209000	1210000	Hmm.
1210000	1211000	Should be interesting.
1211000	1212000	You teases.
1212000	1213000	I know.
1213000	1218000	Now I have to find somebody who owns a Blu-ray player, or camp out and watch it at Best Buy,
1218000	1220000	or something on the TV there.
1220000	1221000	That's awesome.
1221000	1224000	I can't wait to see that.
1224000	1229600	Anyways, there's one thing we talked about last week, which was the Kingdom Hearts final
1229600	1231160	mix.
1231160	1237800	That is actually going to be including a PlayStation 2 remake of Chain of Memories in it as well.
1237800	1244560	So you will be able to get some nice Chain of Memories action going on.
1244560	1248800	I can tell from experience, by the way, that Chain of Memories on the Game Boy Micro is
1248800	1251040	a pain in the ass.
1251040	1255120	But now you can play it on PlayStation 2, nice and big and huge and all that good stuff.
1255120	1260880	I can play it on my macro and play it at work, I mean at school.
1260880	1265060	It says the game is going to feature full 3D graphics as well as some event cut scenes
1265060	1269600	that will feature the voices in Japanese, not English.
1269600	1273840	They were kind of scarce on the details about the additions to it.
1273840	1277680	That's kind of interesting though, the whole chains of memories being included thing.
1277680	1280800	I think that's pretty cool.
1280800	1285240	I actually dig Axl's Japanese voice, so hey, I'm all over that.
1285240	1288920	But Sega loves us, at least.
1288920	1289920	Sega of America.
1289920	1290920	No they don't.
1290920	1292400	They haven't put out Jambo Safari.
1292400	1293800	Hey, you know what?
1293800	1296840	They're bringing us Shining Force EXA to PS2.
1296840	1298520	Alright, I guess I can give them that.
1298520	1301160	I love Shining Force, I have the old ones.
1301160	1303560	It's my new background at work.
1303560	1307280	There's a screenshot from Shining Force EXA.
1307280	1308960	I need a Jambo Safari background.
1308960	1310560	Chairman, please assist.
1310560	1314680	It's going to be an action RPG.
1314680	1319760	It's going to be taking more of a strategy lean, although they're not giving any major
1319760	1321280	specifics on that.
1321280	1324680	And there is no release date yet announced.
1324680	1330440	But it's Shining Force, hey, Shining Force is awesome.
1330440	1335560	Alright, well, one thing that's not so awesome is the lawsuit, especially when you're on
1335560	1336560	the receiving end.
1336560	1340600	And this week, the Ant Commandos have been on the receiving end of a lawsuit.
1340600	1345840	The Ant Commandos are a California based company that sells Guitar Hero peripherals, specifically
1345840	1348100	a wireless guitar controller.
1348100	1351680	Well guess what, Red Octane has come in and sued their asses.
1351680	1356560	Red Octane is not happy about the unrepentant unlicensedness.
1356560	1361960	Defendants have copied the packaging of plaintiff's products and have used plaintiff's trademarks
1361960	1365880	and copyrighted material in its packaging and advertising of its own products in an
1365880	1368720	effort to cause confusion among consumers.
1368720	1378040	Now, you can't help but go, didn't Red Octane start as a DDR pad manufacturing company?
1378040	1386640	However, I will say this, at one point, didn't Konami officially recognize Red Octane as
1386640	1392640	like their, you know, their cool, we recognize them as like a pad manufacturer?
1392640	1394360	I want to say at one point they did.
1394360	1395360	On top of that, Red Octane didn't.
1395360	1400040	I'm almost positive, until In the Groove came out, then all bets were off.
1400040	1407240	Red Octane also didn't actually go and use the official DDR logo on their product.
1407240	1412480	They didn't say, we are doing this for Konami, the Konami logo didn't show up anywhere on
1412480	1413480	there.
1413480	1419280	I've seen these wireless guitar controllers and I played one and it's complete ass.
1419280	1424000	So if I were Red Octane and this company is going out using our, you know, logo and our
1424000	1430880	name and putting out this, you know, utter crap product, I would definitely sue.
1430880	1436240	And the other side of it is just stupid too, because I'll, Rob, you had more to that.
1436240	1437240	Yes, I will.
1437240	1439240	Kage in our chatroom, I just wanted to say, made it funny.
1439240	1444440	I heard they hired Edgeworth to rep the prosecution side.
1444440	1447000	Objection!
1447000	1450240	Objection!
1450240	1452720	Not even von Karma can make that argument work.
1452720	1456280	Well the Ant Commandos were not going to take this lying down, and with a name like Ant
1456280	1458400	Commandos, you wouldn't expect them to.
1458400	1459400	Don't they sound pretty hardcore?
1459400	1462160	They sound like a shitty indie band.
1462160	1469440	Well the Ant Commandos actually have counter-sued Red Octane and given this timeline as their
1469440	1470440	proof.
1470440	1476920	1999, Topway Electrical Appliances, a part owner of TAC, patents the magical guitar controller
1476920	1478880	for Konami's Guitar Freaks.
1478880	1482880	The design had five fret buttons, very similar to what Guitar Hero has now.
1482880	1488240	2001 to 2004, the CEO of Red Octane as well as the sales manager made several visits to
1488240	1492840	a Topway factory in China and inquired about the magical guitar controller.
1492840	1498280	From 2001 to 2004, Red Octane purchased several hundred magical guitar controllers, and in
1498280	1503360	2005, Red Octane releases Guitar Hero with a controller that looks exactly like the magical
1503360	1504360	guitar.
1504360	1505360	Hold it.
1505360	1510000	I can't say that because they licensed the body shape for their guitars from Gibson.
1510000	1511720	Hold it.
1511720	1514560	I see a little bit of a flaw here.
1514560	1519680	Why would you make a guitar controller with five fret buttons for a Guitar Freak which
1519680	1520760	only has three?
1520760	1523840	Well, you remember, they did.
1523840	1524840	Hold on.
1524840	1525840	Red Octane did.
1525840	1530920	They had five button controllers out before they ever announced Guitar Hero and people
1530920	1536960	were speculating that when Guitar Freaks V was first announced that possibly one of the
1536960	1540120	upgrades that was going to be in it is that it was going to be five buttons.
1540120	1541120	Don't you remember this?
1541120	1544120	Because Red Octane sold five button controllers for quite a while.
1544120	1546000	I never understood why they did that either.
1546000	1547000	Now we don't.
1547000	1552880	I don't know if it was arcade only though, but I think there was an MCO arcade guitar
1552880	1553880	game.
1553880	1558320	I went digging through their Japanese site one time and found this in some type of keyboard
1558320	1562720	sim that they did too, but I didn't know if they ever had a home version of that.
1562720	1564640	If they did, then that makes sense.
1564640	1568640	Of course, if they had a home version of it, we would have heard of it.
1568640	1569640	Interesting.
1569640	1579920	Besides the fact that Red Octane used to make DDR pads, does anyone find this kind of funny
1579920	1584840	that they're using almost the same terminology as the whole in the groove DDR thing?
1584840	1589000	Yeah, but technically, is the thing against them?
1589000	1593120	That's technically Rockstar, but I think Red Octane may fall under that a little bit because
1593120	1595760	they distribute the home version.
1595760	1597860	I want to say they got pulled into some addendum.
1597860	1600920	It's been so long since we covered that case now and we haven't really heard a lot on it,
1600920	1601920	which is a little bit odd.
1601920	1602920	Yeah.
1602920	1606200	We should search the court doc system and see if anything new has come out recently
1606200	1608720	because there might have been a quiet settlement or something.
1608720	1609720	Who knows?
1609720	1611920	I think it would be very interesting if there was.
1611920	1612920	I don't know.
1612920	1617880	I'd like to thank the chat room for sending me various Jambo Safari pictures for use of
1617880	1618880	my background.
1618880	1619880	I appreciate that folks.
1619880	1623200	God, I love OLR chatters.
1623200	1628880	All right, well another thing we love is OLR emailers and every week you send your emails
1628880	1635960	to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura suits up in her asbestos suit and shiny rubber
1635960	1640760	gloves and digs in and pulls out a few of her favorite emails and she reads them to
1640760	1642320	you, like she's going to do right now.
1642320	1643320	Aren't you DarkSakura?
1643320	1651880	I had to break out the tongs this time.
1651880	1658360	Our first email comes from Eddie says, Hey, DarkSakura and Sky, as I have asked in chat
1658360	1661600	on the 200th episode, I would like to know where I can get some of the great music you
1661600	1662600	guys play on air.
1662600	1666440	I would certainly like to know of a legal way to purchase them if they can be found
1666440	1667740	in North America.
1667740	1671600	And I also would like to know of a way to obtain this music if importing it isn't a
1671600	1672600	viable option.
1672600	1675000	Thanks and congrats on hitting 200 jubilations.
1675000	1676000	Hooray.
1676000	1677000	All the best Eddie.
1677000	1678000	Wow.
1678000	1685080	A lot of the songs we play on our station, you can find, you know, since we do have that
1685080	1689280	Bobani history, you go to a lot of music game soundtracks and not just DDR2DX, I mean, of
1689280	1692260	course that's a big bulk of it, but you know, of course a lot of the music we're pulling
1692260	1698200	now is from, you know, Sony series like Parappa and things, you know, put up by Namco, like
1698200	1703240	Technic Beat, whatever, Katamari, you know, game soundtracks.
1703240	1706040	And sometimes you can find these at your local comic book store.
1706040	1711280	I found actually sells, at least the local one here now sells anime and video game import
1711280	1712280	CDs.
1712280	1713600	They've actually been selling them for quite a few years here.
1713600	1714600	Yeah.
1714600	1717840	And you know, you've also got conventions.
1717840	1718840	That's true.
1718840	1721000	Your conventions, you've got online ordering.
1721000	1723640	I've ordered a CDs through Amazon actually.
1723640	1728280	I ordered all my UK gorilla stuff on Amazon.
1728280	1729840	Another PS that's on here.
1729840	1732160	I'm going to Granville Island on October 3rd.
1732160	1736020	If you can tell me some details about the cookie shop, I would gladly purchase some
1736020	1739560	cookies for OLRs, the 200th gift, and buy some for myself.
1739560	1743720	All I remember is that the guy who sold it sold nothing but maple stuff, which I'm sure
1743720	1748280	in Canada, you know, is probably pretty common, sorry, but I just remember the guy was right
1748280	1749280	near an entrance.
1749280	1753600	He sold nothing but maple stuff and he had cookies were on one side and he would give
1753600	1755320	a free sample if you wanted it.
1755320	1757480	I'll take a picture of the box and put it on the forums.
1757480	1758480	How's that?
1758480	1760400	And that'll give you something to look for because I might still have the box somewhere.
1760400	1762040	Send us some if we pay shipping.
1762040	1763160	I just might.
1763160	1764160	I like maple cookies.
1764160	1765960	Yeah, maple's delicious.
1765960	1772200	I need something to remind me of Vancouver because I want to go back, but I'm poor.
1772200	1783360	We also had a nice article sent to us by Robway and it's On Planet Xbox 360, which came first
1783360	1786440	the violence or the video game.
1786440	1790120	It's a pretty big article and it goes into a lot of detail.
1790120	1795720	It's a freaking three-page article, but I would suggest our listeners, I'm going to
1795720	1803460	put it in the chat room, but everyone should go look on planetxbox360.com and I'd say look
1803460	1806440	for this article because it actually is a very good one.
1806440	1810360	I'm linking it in the chat room right now.
1810360	1812360	There it is.
1812360	1814040	Sweet.
1814040	1820360	As far as the next mail is concerned, kind of a long one.
1820360	1822740	Hooray, long emails.
1822740	1825480	This is actually from McFloyd.
1825480	1831680	It says, Dear OLR crew, I've been listening to your podcast for over a year and a half
1831680	1836800	now, so I thought it was really about time I expressed my thoughts on the show.
1836800	1838960	I mainly wanted to say that I really love the show.
1838960	1842360	Over the past two years, I've moved twice from Japan to the US to Switzerland because
1842360	1843820	my dad's a diplomat.
1843820	1845800	We have a one-year temporary posting in DC.
1845800	1849780	Needless to say, I have had to leave a lot of friends behind and it's really great having
1849780	1854040	something I can depend on through all of this chaos, a constant set of voices reassuring
1854040	1857600	me that if one thing can stay the same, life can resume being normal again.
1857600	1859000	Wow, that's really sweet.
1859000	1860000	Thank you.
1860000	1864020	I was in Tokyo for four years and unfortunately, I didn't take advantage of the fact that Tokyo
1864020	1867380	is the center of the gaming world, but now I'm in Switzerland, which is ridiculously
1867380	1871240	expensive and far, far away from being any kind of gaming center.
1871240	1876160	Now, as I begin high school, I'm getting more and more into video games and being here certainly
1876160	1877160	doesn't help.
1877160	1880740	You guys always have good advice, or almost always, and you really love the games, which
1880740	1881740	is very important.
1881740	1885660	I greatly depend on your podcast for most of my gaming news and for a source of entertainment
1885660	1886660	to and from school.
1886660	1890480	In the summers, the podcast helps me through lawn mowing jobs and throughout the year.
1890480	1893040	It's my favorite gaming podcast of the three that I listen to.
1893040	1894040	Thank you so much.
1894040	1895040	Wow.
1895040	1899160	This next part actually has a lot of good insight.
1899160	1902400	I wanted to comment on the gaming laws and people against video gaming.
1902400	1903400	You guys are completely right.
1903400	1905280	This is a violation of our First Amendment rights.
1905280	1908360	If this is a free country, people have to have the right to express themselves however
1908360	1909360	they want.
1909360	1913960	By banning one thing, issues for similar things will come up and from those issues from other
1913960	1914960	issues.
1914960	1917000	What about violent or sexually explicit movies or music?
1917000	1919860	Are we going to ban those things and make it illegal for a minor to possess them at
1919860	1921240	all or to view them?
1921240	1925520	The government has no right to control what we see, what we hear, what we do.
1925520	1932400	Also, as being allowed to buy violent video games to play them, what will they do instead?
1932400	1935560	I believe we'll end up with more violence in real life.
1935560	1939560	The adults who are trying to get these laws passed neither understand video games nor
1939560	1944380	see how video games are developing and are blindly scared of this new trend of kids playing
1944380	1946360	these games more and more.
1946360	1949520	Video games are actually becoming more and more active with such games as DDR, Guitar
1949520	1952520	Hero and the Wii controllers evolving from previous ideas.
1952520	1958120	Basically, the e-mail goes a little bit further into the educational games like Brain Age,
1958120	1959120	Civilization.
1959120	1960280	You're a fan of Civilization.
1960280	1961400	Good job.
1961400	1962800	Games that are helping.
1962800	1965120	I like this person a lot.
1965120	1971480	I'd say if you're going to high school and have this type of insight, I am looking forward
1971480	1974040	to see what you're like at a high school.
1974040	1976480	Well, consider what he said his dad does too.
1976480	1981200	He's a diplomat, so it's kind of interesting.
1981200	1984320	To me, that makes this insight especially interesting knowing that the dad is in this
1984320	1986120	very political position.
1986120	1987640	I like what's said here.
1987640	1996120	Adults should understand that this is just the new age of people and help children choose
1996120	2001120	games that are appropriate, active or even educational if need be helping them understand
2001120	2003080	the issues in the more violent games.
2003080	2006940	Video games are very different from what they experienced as children and learning by doing
2006940	2011280	is the best way, so video games have a huge potential in not only letting people have
2011280	2017080	fun, but in teaching the things that they'll remember much better.
2017080	2019480	The last paragraph, I'll just read that.
2019480	2023200	Finally, although this is just a little late, congratulations on your 200 episodes, so Loki,
2023200	2027120	Dark Sakura, Sky, keep up the great work and I'm looking forward to 200 more episodes.
2027120	2030920	We'll try.
2030920	2034360	If you're listening, I hope you are, I would actually like your permission to put this
2034360	2036080	one up on our forum.
2036080	2038520	Letter of the week.
2038520	2041160	And not just because they kissed our ass, but it helps.
2041160	2043640	It's a very well thought out email.
2043640	2047640	I have a question for anyone that's in the chat room that might have an Xbox Live Vision
2047640	2048640	camera.
2048640	2050360	Is it fucking blurry as mine is?
2050360	2056080	Because seriously, I cannot focus this thing no matter what kind of light is in the room,
2056080	2060440	no matter if it's trying to focus something far away, close, it does not matter.
2060440	2062040	It's so goddamn blurry.
2062040	2065320	Goddamn, here we are trying to say something nice about a listener and it all comes back
2065320	2068080	to me, me, me, me, me, doesn't it, Loki?
2068080	2069440	Yes it does.
2069440	2071240	You selfish ass.
2071240	2074080	I'm just curious.
2074080	2075520	I want this thing to work.
2075520	2080000	I do want it to work so I can play UNO and make funny faces at people and stuff like
2080000	2085600	that, but I can't do that until it's not blurry because I just look like a fucking ghost in
2085600	2087380	this thing, so that doesn't work.
2087380	2090240	And once again, SSG100Matt has said, Loki, it's your face.
2090240	2094200	It's not my face because I pointed at you too and you're still blurry, so...
2094200	2095760	I'm beautiful.
2095760	2099000	That's what you get for watching the videotape.
2099000	2105080	They say try to clean the lens, God punishing you because you're complaining about the praisers
2105080	2107120	at the church making a lot of noise.
2107120	2109080	But he was messing with that beforehand.
2109080	2112680	I don't understand how I can clean the lens seeing as I just opened this thing up.
2112680	2114520	I mean, how would it be dirty already?
2114520	2115520	Hey, email.
2115520	2116520	Email's nice.
2116520	2117520	Yes, email.
2117520	2118520	Hi, OLR.
2118520	2119520	Hi, listener.
2119520	2121520	This is from DNL.
2121520	2122920	Oh, okay.
2122920	2123920	We love you, DNL.
2123920	2124920	Thank you.
2124920	2125920	Happy episode 201.
2125920	2130160	I know that I didn't get a chance to wish you guys a happy 200, but the biggest part
2130160	2135600	of reaching a milestone is the aftermath, though I've only been on the show once live
2135600	2138360	at B3 when I met Rob for the first time.
2138360	2141040	Was that when me and Megumi decided to run away?
2141040	2142040	I think so.
2142040	2147480	B3 was this big DDR tournament that took place at Pier 39 in San Francisco, and this was
2147480	2152040	probably in about our second year of existence that we did the B3 thing.
2152040	2156080	We weren't quite to 100 yet, but we were definitely getting old.
2156080	2157600	Megumi and I were really hungry.
2157600	2158600	Yeah.
2158600	2161060	I'll tell you what.
2161060	2167600	Doing live radio coverage for two days straight takes a lot of talent that I'm not so sure
2167600	2174800	we all have because we... Seriously, I wish I had recordings of some of that old stuff,
2174800	2178360	and I just might somewhere, but I seem to recall there was one DDR tournament that we
2178360	2184800	covered that Loki ended up sitting in the back, and he's just going, yeah, so DDR tournament
2184800	2190400	going on, or somebody's sitting in the background, and I'm like, yeah, for hours, and I had a
2190400	2193080	cold, and I didn't... Oh, God, that was so funny.
2193080	2194080	That was a shaft.
2194080	2195080	Was it?
2195080	2196080	That was a shaft.
2196080	2197080	All right.
2197080	2198080	I hated it.
2198080	2201880	I was busy with the tournament and the fried Twinkies, but no, Megumi and I ended up leaving
2201880	2205240	the tournament, and by the way, not meaning to cut in on the email, I would also like
2205240	2212520	to give Megumi and her fiance a congratulations on their upcoming wedding.
2212520	2213520	Yay, weddings.
2213520	2214520	Congratulations for your engagement.
2214520	2218520	Yay, everybody getting married but me.
2218520	2221600	I make no comment.
2221600	2224840	Being married is not all it's cracked up to be.
2224840	2228860	Anyway, I've been listening on and off for three years, but started listening regularly
2228860	2230760	as soon as there was a podcast.
2230760	2233860	That's right from the very beginning, and Rob, he's so nice.
2233860	2238120	I had only seen him twice before both at competitions, but when we bumped into each other literally
2238120	2243320	at the Dear Friends concert before E3 2004, and he remembered my name and even introduced
2243320	2248400	me to the awesome VX Jason XV, the amazing mod, and then there was Roscoe's, but enough
2248400	2249400	with the reminiscing.
2249400	2253400	Cheers to another X amount of episodes.
2253400	2255520	Renee is just the cutest girl you'll ever meet.
2255520	2258360	I mean, she's adorable.
2258360	2259360	You need to come on the show, Renee.
2259360	2260360	I know you're listening.
2260360	2262360	You need to come on the show.
2262360	2266440	I just would put her in a box and bring her out for the show.
2266440	2267440	Oh, I'm here.
2267440	2268440	She's so cute.
2268440	2269440	I'm just kidding.
2269440	2270440	I wouldn't leave you.
2270440	2272440	Yeah, I put holes in it so you can breathe.
2272440	2276440	Because you're damn sure used to oxygen.
2276440	2277680	Just two more little ones.
2277680	2278680	Okay.
2278680	2279680	Hello, OLR.
2279680	2280680	My name is Thomas, and I'm a big fan.
2280680	2282320	I just wanted to say hello for the first time.
2282320	2286360	I live all the way in Belgium, so unfortunately I'm not able to listen to the live show.
2286360	2290040	Well, thank you for emailing us from all the way in Belgium.
2290040	2291200	Rad.
2291200	2292800	We love our international friends.
2292800	2296160	The last one is from Ranma.
2296160	2305400	Yes, Ranchan has decided to email us, so I'm going to go over the highlights of this email,
2305400	2306400	okay?
2306400	2307400	Hi, OLR.
2307400	2308400	Ranma here.
2308400	2310280	Isn't that how he also greets us on Skype?
2310280	2311280	I think so.
2311280	2313080	You're on the show too damn much, Ranma.
2313080	2314080	I don't know.
2314080	2315080	No, I'm kidding.
2315080	2316080	What's he got to say?
2316080	2317080	We love Ranma.
2317080	2318080	Oh, we do.
2318080	2320440	I truly enjoyed episode 200, and I listened to it again on my way to work last week, and
2320440	2324800	I just have to say that you, Jamie, are truly a voice in the female gaming.
2324800	2329660	I have had a few female gamers on my friends list, but you by far are the most vocal and
2329660	2331120	outspoken of them all.
2331120	2332120	That's just because I'm a bitch.
2332120	2336000	I truly respect you for that, and don't ever lose that edge of yours.
2336000	2337000	Oh, thank you.
2337000	2340920	Anywho, there are a couple of things I wanted to point out from a couple of past episodes
2340920	2342760	just in case I missed tonight's episode.
2342760	2344160	One, price of the Wii remote.
2344160	2345800	I don't know why people are angry over the price.
2345800	2350900	The standard Xbox 360 pad is $50, and I don't hear anyone complain about that one.
2350900	2353560	The Wii remote is more than just a controller.
2353560	2357240	It has more features than any other next-gen controller out there, and it's less expensive.
2357240	2359260	Two, techno DDR Heaven.
2359260	2362680	About two weeks ago, I was with my friends at South Street Seaport, and we heard some
2362680	2363680	techno music.
2363680	2366600	My friend Carmen said, is it wrong to think of DDR when hearing techno?
2366600	2368680	I replied, it's not wrong.
2368680	2369680	It's in the groove.
2369680	2373440	No, it's not wrong unless it's in the groove, and we laughed and got closer, and the song
2373440	2375960	was Heaven from DDR Max US 1, I think.
2375960	2377760	I figured you'd all get a laugh out of that.
2377760	2379760	That is pretty funny.
2379760	2381880	Three, Enchanted Arms Gay Voice.
2381880	2383920	Yes, Rob, I totally agree with that.
2383920	2390440	I was listening to a CAG cast, and they put clips of it, and the guy was so flaming gay.
2390440	2395160	To quote South Park, gay, totally gay, Liberace gay.
2395160	2397360	That was the one that they're trying to show me last night.
2397360	2399880	They have sunglasses on now.
2399880	2403760	With no disrespect, why is the cheap-ass gamer cast talking about that $60 game?
2403760	2404760	That ain't cheap.
2404760	2407520	That ain't a cheap game.
2407520	2408520	I'm just kidding.
2408520	2409520	Do what you want.
2409520	2410520	Do what you want.
2410520	2411520	FF12 Day.
2411520	2412920	I am excited about this, and I will be there as Black Mage.
2412920	2414480	I will take pictures for all.
2414480	2416560	Five, SNK New Hardware.
2416560	2419440	What SNK needs to do is make better hardware technology.
2419440	2422400	Every time they make a game on their normal equipment, in less than three weeks after
2422400	2425520	it's out, the ROMs of it are totally found online.
2425520	2428640	In my honest opinion, that's a major reason why they are losing money.
2428640	2430040	Yeah, true.
2430040	2437920	Although, I was one of the people that paid $390 for KOF 2000, but mmm.
2437920	2439440	Loki's I'm Staying In.
2439440	2441440	Thank you so much for playing that.
2441440	2444680	The song reminded me of how long I've been listening to you guys.
2444680	2447200	I truly thank Rai-Chan for telling me about you guys.
2447200	2450480	I'm surprised we didn't get more emails on that.
2450480	2451960	Thank God.
2451960	2456560	I would guess that I have been listening since episode 50 or so, and for a dial-up station,
2456560	2458560	that was a really good stream.
2458560	2459960	Back in the day, we were.
2459960	2461320	Seven, Dance Revolution.
2461320	2464080	After seeing it again, I say that it has already gotten old.
2464080	2465200	They had eliminated two teams.
2465200	2468520	The remaining three were doing new dance routines to the same techno dance beat as the first
2468520	2469520	episode.
2469520	2472840	What Dance Revolution needs is to allow teams to dance and choreograph songs from any of
2472840	2477320	the DDR games, and maybe, just maybe, let the Slumber Party Girls cover a B4U track.
2477320	2478720	Well, that's all for now.
2478720	2480760	I'll try to call in if I can.
2480760	2484560	If not, have a great episode 201, and by the way, wouldn't this be like the fifth season
2484560	2485560	of OLR Live?
2485560	2489720	Oh, and Rob Iami said that we can plan out SkyCon in October.
2489720	2491320	I'm still looking forward to that.
2491320	2495120	I think we kind of dropped the whole distinguishing seasons thing.
2495120	2500320	I can tell you that behind the scenes, we've been trying to iron out a new website, and
2500320	2506280	probably with that will come some very superficial type changes when it comes to art and logos
2506280	2510400	and things of that nature, but that won't be until probably the end of the year going
2510400	2511720	on into 2007.
2511720	2516940	But we know our website is not the best, so we kind of want to do what we can to make
2516940	2517940	it better.
2517940	2518940	Our website is special.
2518940	2524600	I mean, God, don't get me wrong, I mean, Jason's done so much work into it and stuff, but we're
2524600	2525600	just fine.
2525600	2528680	We're starting to realize the limitations of the software when it comes to what we want
2528680	2532440	to do aesthetically, and I think there's been talk behind the scenes that we want to take
2532440	2535880	our front page news in a real different direction.
2535880	2538760	So more to come on that by the end of the year.
2538760	2541540	Flaming Bozo told us we should be on XM.
2541540	2542540	That's very sweet.
2542540	2543540	We should.
2543540	2544540	Write XM and tell them that.
2544540	2548040	Tell XM to pick us up.
2548040	2550040	That's it for email.
2550040	2551040	Sweet.
2551040	2552040	Well, thank you, emailers.
2552040	2553040	Send us more.
2553040	2554320	Mail back at OrangeLawnTrader.com.
2554320	2555320	You guys rock.
2555320	2557400	And we'll let Rob read it all.
2557400	2564480	Well, there's some pretty cool stuff coming out from TokugameShow from Namco Bandai, and
2564480	2568500	it's about this game that used to be called Trusty Bell, or at least it's Trusty Bell
2568500	2569500	in Japan.
2569500	2576440	Japan, now it's coming over here as Eternal Sonata, which is a pretty cool looking RPG.
2576440	2580480	God, isn't this the one where you're like in Chopin's mind or something like that?
2580480	2581480	Yeah.
2581480	2583440	Oh, God, that game looks weird, but cool.
2583440	2586600	Yeah, so we'll be seeing that probably next year at some point.
2586600	2590000	I'm kind of glad they're having the faith to port that over, but I would like more information
2590000	2591960	on Blue Dragon US port, please.
2591960	2592960	Okay, thanks.
2592960	2593960	I want a remake of Blue Dragon.
2593960	2596240	How is Blue Dragon nowhere in our show world tonight?
2596240	2599880	Okay, I want to say something about Blue Dragon then, right now.
2599880	2606080	There were lines like 90 minutes long to see Blue Dragon over at the Tokyo Game Show, which
2606080	2607080	isn't a surprise.
2607080	2611200	Well, it is a surprise when you consider it's an Xbox 360 game and this is Japan.
2611200	2614860	But when you consider that, you know, remember when it was big, you know, turn heads that
2614860	2618920	some of the people behind Final Fantasy had gone over to the Xbox side?
2618920	2620680	Well, this is the game.
2620680	2622120	You know, this is the big game.
2622120	2624320	And I'll tell you what, from the previews I saw, it looks pretty hot.
2624320	2629480	I can't wait to play it, so I would wait in a 90 minute line to play Blue Dragon as well.
2629480	2635480	Hell, we waited probably about 60 to see Spore, and some people waited about three times as
2635480	2637560	long to see the Wii, so why not?
2637560	2638680	And some of us didn't.
2638680	2639680	Some of us just sort of waited.
2639680	2642440	Well, some of you just can kiss my butt.
2642440	2643440	You know what?
2643440	2644440	That's okay.
2644440	2648040	I'm used to having my ass be the one kissed, so huh-huh.
2648040	2655680	As far as news, Microsoft has said that they are going to waive the cost of repairs on
2655680	2662640	Xbox 360 consoles that were manufactured before January 1st, 2006, and refund any fees already
2662640	2665640	paid.
2665640	2672400	They were basically doing an analysis of the repair, and basically it was the initial manufacturing
2672400	2673400	run of the machine.
2673400	2677200	They've determined where a lot of problems are, and they keep having them come in from
2677200	2678200	that.
2678200	2682160	They said that it was a higher rate than what they are happy with, so they've decided to
2682160	2690880	comp repairs for any of the consoles manufactured before January 1st, 2006, and do those refunds.
2690880	2696280	I'd say you probably have to contact Microsoft technical support.
2696280	2701920	They did actually, though, say that they rejected claims of an unusually high hardware failure
2701920	2702920	rate.
2702920	2706580	Well, good for Microsoft for doing the right thing with this, I think, because I think
2706580	2710480	to charge somebody for these broken systems just because their 90-day warranty was up
2710480	2714520	was kind of mean, but I think the window needs to be extended a little bit.
2714520	2719540	I bought my Xbox 360 in February, and that thing broke right away, and I would be pissed
2719540	2722840	if I was right on the bubble there January, February, and mine broke.
2722840	2726600	I think it's obvious that there were still some production problems to the earlier year,
2726600	2730080	so thank you, Microsoft, for taking a step in the right direction.
2730080	2732760	Now take one more, in my opinion.
2732760	2734760	They need to.
2734760	2741440	Anyway, hmm, a quick story kind of relating to Xbox 360.
2741440	2747240	The official Xbox magazine ran a promo from Circuit City, and Circuit City was giving
2747240	2752840	away this coupon that said that they were going to be offering 15% off of 99 Nights
2752840	2754080	and Gears of War.
2754080	2759280	Hey, pretty cool, except for the fact that the coupon was set to expire October 31st,
2759280	2763720	so while you could get 15% off 99 Nights, that thing won't do you a damn bit of good
2763720	2767600	when it comes to Gears of War, because Gears of War is not coming out until November.
2767600	2771760	Well, just so you know, a clarification has arrived, and this, by the way, didn't make
2771760	2774760	Circuit City look good, because there was that whole story a couple weeks ago about
2774760	2779680	the one in San Diego that was offering to install the backwards compatibility on your
2779680	2780680	Xbox for a fee.
2780680	2782040	I'm surprised it wasn't the best buy to say that.
2782040	2783500	That was so messed up.
2783500	2787560	But anyway, so Circuit City, you really have to dig themselves out of a hole, and they
2787560	2793760	are, Official Xbox Magazine sent something out that said Circuit City is aware that the
2793760	2796360	coupon in the November issue is messed up.
2796360	2800940	They're going to publish another coupon in the next issue of Official Xbox Magazine that
2800940	2807440	will extend the promotion through the end of November, I believe it was.
2807440	2809080	That's pretty cool, Elise.
2809080	2810080	That's nice of them.
2810080	2814880	And also, speaking of nice of people to do something for us, SNK finally got their head
2814880	2816280	out of their butt.
2816280	2823040	We are going to be getting a new King of Fighters with a complete visual overhaul, new sprites,
2823040	2824040	finally!
2824040	2829320	Because I remember sitting back and playing, like, what was it, KOF 2001, and it was the
2829320	2833680	same old Q. Yeah, we have Kula, you know, with everything.
2833680	2836240	It's like, no.
2836240	2842720	They finally have listened to us, and there actually is speculation that it's going to
2842720	2848720	be high res sprites like in the Guilty Gear series.
2848720	2855080	We can only hope that certain other publishers of ongoing 2D fighting series listen to us,
2855080	2858160	Capcom, please.
2858160	2863480	That's kind of hot that finally King of Fighters is getting some new sprites, because, you
2863480	2867160	know, Loki likes to bitch on every episode, and I'll admit I've done it too, that, you
2867160	2870280	know, with some of these games like Metal Slug and King of Fighters, they have not changed
2870280	2872960	the graphics one damn bit in the past ten years.
2872960	2874640	So someone at SNK has been listening.
2874640	2878800	You know what I would like to see, is I would like to see the KOF series get the Street
2878800	2885680	Fighter 3 treatment, with the extra animations and all of that.
2885680	2889080	Well, that's the thing about Metal Slug, actually, one of the things they announced this week
2889080	2894720	was that the Metal Slug Anthology is going to be including Metal Slug 6 as well.
2894720	2896920	And will it have new graphics?
2896920	2901320	Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.
2901320	2906200	But it has Metal Slug 6, I mean, that's got to be different than Metal Slug 5, or 4, or
2906200	2907200	3, or 2, or 1.
2907200	2909520	Well, you know, I'm not going to knock Metal Slug, it is a good game, and getting six of
2909520	2913540	them at one price is not going to be a bad deal, but I think if they're going to make
2913540	2918800	another standalone one, you might want to up the graphics to the new, you know, please
2918800	2923120	don't hear me wrong, a game doesn't have to have the greatest graphics in the world to
2923120	2924520	be a good game.
2924520	2932480	But you know, if the technology's there, is it that hard to change it and make it a little
2932480	2933480	nicer looking?
2933480	2934480	I don't know.
2934480	2935480	I don't expect you to be blown away.
2935480	2939200	I don't need, you know, Halo 3 Gears of War style graphics, I just want, you know.
2939200	2944680	Well, I even remember back in the day when Mugen was having its big day, there were actually
2944680	2949740	people going in and retouching a lot of sprites from old games and making completely new fighters
2949740	2951280	with the Mugen engine.
2951280	2959600	I don't know, I think it's kind of weird that, you know, I mean it's the 12th game and they
2959600	2962480	haven't really done much upgrades on it yet.
2962480	2968280	Well, one game that's kind of funny that Sony's been really, you know, touting is like, yeah,
2968280	2974080	this is our launch title for the PlayStation 3, check it out, it's got awesome tilt controller
2974080	2979840	technology functionality and stuff like that, oh, Warhawk, yeah, Warhawk's really awesome
2979840	2984360	and it's really awesome and the fact that it's delayed until summer of 2007 because
2984360	2987480	apparently, yeah, they're having trouble with it.
2987480	2994160	It's only listed as about 50% complete right now at Tokyo Game Show and it's not very good
2994160	3000800	seeing as it's supposed to be released in a few months, so, ouch, yeah, so that's official,
3000800	3002200	they've delayed it until 2007.
3002200	3008140	Yeah, and it says this has actually been confirmed by a Sony Computer Entertainment Japan fact
3008140	3014440	sheet that it's confirmed as a summer 2007 release, so, you know, with that out of the
3014440	3019600	way, you know, I guess there are only, there's not a lot of launch titles, at least you're
3019600	3025440	getting Ridge Racer 7, which does look pretty hot, Ridge Racer 7 is 100% complete, so yeah,
3025440	3029160	you will be getting that launch, so, and actually that's one of the first titles that's actually
3029160	3033560	being released, you know, because they usually release titles before the console launches
3033560	3036520	and that's actually one of the first ones that come out.
3036520	3038760	Good job Namco, good job.
3038760	3044240	Well, you might have heard during this week some dates get announced before they were
3044240	3050840	supposed to and among other things from Ubisoft, that's because somebody found a 2GB archive
3050840	3057140	file on the FTP server that had information, video, artwork and screens from all the upcoming
3057140	3065840	roster of Ubisoft titles, whoops, meaning that they discovered Far Cry Wii, Lost, Naruto,
3065840	3070220	Open Season, Rainbow Six Vegas, Splinter Cell 4, Surf's Up, Shaun White Snowboarding, Star
3070220	3076080	Wars Lethal Alliance on PSP, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Assassin's Creed.
3076080	3080400	There were also some previously unannounced games that were in this RAR file, a brand
3080400	3085300	new Prince of Persia, which seems to be something we've actually mentioned on this program previously
3085300	3088720	and Splinter Cell games and Far Cry and Rocky on the PSP.
3088720	3092280	You know, it's so funny because I thought Rocky had already been announced, I've had
3092280	3097280	actually a sell sheet for Rocky for about a couple of weeks now, I didn't know there
3097280	3103360	was an announcement, it's hard for me to keep track, oh well, but yeah, Rocky's coming out.
3103360	3108700	Anyway, that was a very interesting find on the internet and Dark Soccer likes to surf
3108700	3112260	the internet up and down and make interesting finds of her own and she'll share them with
3112260	3119520	you each and every week, I sure will, in this segment called the Website of the Week.
3119520	3126600	And no, it's not the Arcade Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
3126600	3131760	My Website of the Week is actually an official website and anyone who's been reading my live
3131760	3139360	journal and listening to me go into fangasms over this, the Website of the Week is the
3139360	3145840	official Doctor Who website on the BBC website, because I love Doctor Who.
3145840	3152120	If you go to bbc.co.uk slash Doctor Who, you will go to the fantastic site where there's
3152120	3158360	lots of wallpaper with David Tennant all over it and Billy Piper all over it and K-9 and
3158360	3164520	Sarah Jane and everybody and downloadable mobile phone stuff and it's actually better
3164520	3166920	than just about any of the fan sites I've seen.
3166920	3175460	And there is even a link to the classic series too with a What is the TARDIS tutorial, so
3175460	3184600	as someone who has grown up with Doctor Who as a constant, a squee, fangasm, yep, I'm
3184600	3189120	proud of it.
3189120	3196760	Doctor Who, hey, Doctor Who, okay, sorry, I can't help but think of that whenever I
3196760	3199720	hear her talk about Doctor Who, that old band chair, you know that song that makes me want
3199720	3200720	to do?
3200720	3201720	What?
3201720	3202720	Kill People.
3202720	3206480	It's very ironic that, you know, that song makes me want to kill people because that's
3206480	3212320	what happens to those people that kill people for an Xbox, yeah, the Xbox Killers as they've
3212320	3219320	been kind of named now, Jerome Hunter and Troy Victorino.
3219320	3223320	Calling them the Xbox Killers makes them sound like they go into people's houses at night
3223320	3229560	like ninjas and like cut the cords from the Xbox and smash it with a hammer while everyone's
3229560	3232040	sleeping and then leaves the house silently.
3232040	3240320	Well anyways, the Xbox Killers, they were sentenced to death, so yeah, apparently they
3240320	3246240	murdered six people in 2004 and yeah, now they're dead.
3246240	3247400	What exactly did they do?
3247400	3249680	They murdered them over an Xbox or what?
3249680	3255960	Well that's what they assumed because they stole an Xbox, it says the murders were vicious,
3255960	3260100	blood being found on the floors and ceilings and the walls and the victims were not only
3260100	3263280	bludgeoned to death but were mutilated afterwards.
3263280	3271160	And it says, you know, basically, you know, the killer, oh never mind, that's another
3271160	3276960	story where they're talking about that person who killed their child over the Xbox thing
3276960	3277960	too.
3277960	3284880	A lot of people causing violence over an Xbox, I don't know, hmm, I think the Wii will be
3284880	3289200	so much, so easily accessible to this kind of stuff, you know, especially when you get
3289200	3293840	those third party controllers or something that are shaped like a samurai sword or are
3293840	3300360	actually a samurai sword, ooh that'd be cool, samurai sword, you can kill people, alright,
3300360	3301360	or hookers.
3301360	3304400	You're just waiting for that with the Wii, aren't you?
3304400	3305400	Yes.
3305400	3310600	Alright, anyway, that's just about going to wrap it up for news tonight, so that means
3310600	3317080	it's time for us to take your Skype calls and you can call us by visiting www.orangelaungeready.com,

3329180	3333360	Jason is looking into some toll free options for us, there may be something coming in the
3333360	3337080	very near future, wouldn't that make a lot of you folks very happy.
3337080	3340840	Let's go to the phones, hi you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
3340840	3341840	Ravenstaufen.
3341840	3344480	Hi Ravenstaufen, what's on your mind buddy?
3344480	3351480	You know that Xbox serial killer, in my view of this episode of the Boondocks, when we
3351480	3355280	were like, we gotta find the Xbox killer, we have to find him.
3355280	3357960	You have to set that up for me a little bit, you have to pardon my ignorance, but I don't
3357960	3362360	watch a whole lot of TV, so what's this show all about, wait, is that the cartoon one that's
3362360	3367640	on Adult Swim, I think I've seen a clip of it.
3367640	3372640	The show is a suburban, these are African Americans that is out of their unit and they
3372640	3379000	go to suburban life and see Huey and Dewey and they go on adventures and this episode
3379000	3384280	involved a guy going to jail because he got murdered over an Xbox and he went like, they're
3384280	3388200	gonna rape me, they're gonna rape me, you gotta do something, he went like hold on.
3388200	3392000	Was this before or after the real life Xbox killer?
3392000	3394680	Oh before, way before.
3394680	3396720	Hmm, interesting.
3396720	3402000	So is it possible that this show, maybe this person should be called the Boondocks killer?
3402000	3406000	I think so, because that's what makes me laugh about it, I was like oh god, this reminds
3406000	3408320	me of that episode.
3408320	3414320	Interesting reality mirroring fiction, kind of sad though, regardless of what inspired
3414320	3417080	it, these people should have known better, period.
3417080	3418080	Yeah.
3418080	3420600	Anything else on your mind, my friend?
3420600	3421600	Two more things.
3421600	3422600	Okay.
3422600	3424880	I got a bone to pick with you, Sky.
3424880	3425880	What?
3425880	3429840	Last time when I talked to you about DS Lite, you were running over with a car and I would
3429840	3431560	get a black one.
3431560	3433480	I did?
3433480	3434840	I probably did.
3434840	3438240	Yeah, you said buy the warranty and run it over with a car.
3438240	3443320	Oh wait, I don't think I said that, I think the, uh, uh, uh, Miekletoff said it.
3443320	3444320	Maybe I did, I don't know.
3444320	3445320	Fine.
3445320	3449720	Whoever who said it, I still had to pay 50 bucks for the black one.
3449720	3452280	Did you seriously go and run over it with a car?
3452280	3455400	No, thank god it had a hairline fracture.
3455400	3456400	Oh, okay.
3456400	3461000	I was like, oh my god, please don't tell me you actually went and ran over it with a car.
3461000	3462000	No, I would be sad.
3462000	3463880	I'd like to see someone who did that.
3463880	3466880	You know, Wal-Mart's return policy might let you do that.
3466880	3472240	Oh, Wal-Mart, you can return anything at Wal-Mart, it doesn't matter if it's there.
3472240	3475000	Somebody in chat had brought that up earlier, so just made me think of that, the whole Wal-Mart
3475000	3478800	return policy is so, uh, liberal.
3478800	3480400	Okay.
3480400	3481400	What's the other thing?
3481400	3486300	Uh, do you hold Christmas to a high regard, because you feel, when I listen to Orange
3486300	3490360	Lounge Radio for a year, it feels like Christmas is nothing, just another day.
3490360	3494840	Um, I hold Boxing Day in high regard.
3494840	3499440	You know, I'll tell you what, in my personal family life, we don't have the whole big deal
3499440	3500440	Christmas thing.
3500440	3504480	We will do something on Christmas morning, but that's about it, and there's no children
3504480	3505480	really in the family.
3505480	3509360	We're kind of a small family unit, so it's not the big deal it is for some families.
3509360	3510880	Oh, one more thing.
3510880	3511880	Yeah.
3511880	3516200	Dark Soccer, are you going to require an Elvira pinball game, because I love that game on
3516200	3517200	the Atari Lynx.
3517200	3519200	Yes, I own that.
3519200	3520680	Elvira pinball.
3520680	3521680	That would be hot.
3521680	3522680	You need to do that.
3522680	3524240	Make that happen.
3524240	3528520	I want to say, I've seen an Elvira pinball recently, because I know some people who own
3528520	3529520	one.
3529520	3533080	Isn't that the one that had the lower playing field?
3533080	3535040	It's been so long, Dark, I'm sorry.
3535040	3539280	I do believe, because I've seen one, I did see an Elvira pinball, the place that we got
3539280	3545160	our last action hero from, I think, had an Elvira pinball in their little repair place.
3545160	3549160	The last time I saw an Elvira machine was in Chico, where I went to school.
3549160	3550160	So.
3550160	3556320	Actually, next on our list is actually a Doctor Who pinball machine for me, and a Medivial
3556320	3557320	Madness.
3557320	3561520	What about, I know this is so random, what about an Austin Power one?
3561520	3563920	That one has fond memories with me, too.
3563920	3568200	It's a fun one, one I wouldn't mind, although I actually found, Dan found a place in town
3568200	3572360	that has a Pirates of the Caribbean machine, one of the new Stern machines.
3572360	3573360	I want to play that.
3573360	3574360	It's $4,000, though.
3574360	3576360	I don't have that.
3576360	3577360	Yeah.
3577360	3583760	You can only get them new, although from what I understand, the licensing to put out some
3583760	3588880	of the prototype machines that Capcom had out, like Big Bang Bar, from what I understand,
3588880	3591560	I think Stern acquired the licensing to release those now.
3591560	3593200	I'll have to find that out for sure.
3593200	3594200	Yeah.
3594200	3595200	Would you?
3595200	3596200	Definitely.
3596200	3598200	As soon as I find that out, I'll make it public knowledge.
3598200	3599200	All right.
3599200	3600200	Oh, let's party.
3600200	3601600	That was a great staple.
3601600	3602800	All right.
3602800	3605440	As much as I'd love to reminisce about pinball all night, we've got other college we've got
3605440	3606440	to get to.
3606440	3607440	All right.
3607440	3608440	Ravensdaupin.
3608440	3609440	That's it.
3609440	3610440	All right.
3610440	3611440	Have a good night.
3611440	3612440	You too.
3612440	3613440	Bye.
3613440	3614440	See ya.
3614440	3615440	All right.
3615440	3616440	Let's go to another call.
3616440	3617440	Hi.
3617440	3618440	You're on Orange Launch Radio.
3618440	3619440	Who's this?
3619440	3620440	Hey.
3620440	3621440	This is Anoush.
3621440	3622440	Hi, Anoush.
3622440	3623440	What's on your mind?
3623440	3624440	Hey.
3624440	3627040	I was just wondering if you guys heard about that software update that Microsoft's going
3627040	3631640	to release for the 360 that's going to output 1080p.
3631640	3632640	Hot damn.
3632640	3634160	We left a lot of news off of tonight's roll.
3634160	3635160	That is a biggie.
3635160	3636360	Thank you for bringing that up.
3636360	3640800	That was a big point that Microsoft did during their press conference that, oh, snap, Sony,
3640800	3644800	we can do 1080p too, and we're doing it through a software update, bitch.
3644800	3645800	Yeah.
3645800	3652560	They're going to be able to do it, I know, through the TV either, well, not for movies,
3652560	3653560	not through the HDTV.
3653560	3655040	Well, aren't they going to upscale movies or something?
3655040	3658440	Movies and stuff will be upscaled, and games will be upscaled with 1080p.
3658440	3661560	You can do 1080p with a VGA cable.
3661560	3665960	But now Sony's come back and kind of pooh-poohing that statement going, oh, but it's not native
3665960	3666960	to 1080p.
3666960	3667960	They're just upscaling things.
3667960	3673960	Yeah, but if games are programmed to 1080p, they will play it natively at 1080p.
3673960	3674960	Interesting.
3674960	3678360	It's just, yeah, they're saying, oh, they're not natively 1080p.
3678360	3681400	Well, yeah, neither are some of your games, so shut the hell up.
3681400	3686240	News, I'll ask you, what do you think about the news?
3686240	3691080	It doesn't really make sense to me, because wouldn't they put some kind of digital output
3691080	3693160	on it, like HDMI?
3693160	3697400	Well, technically, can't components handle 1080p?
3697400	3700120	It's just not as, I mean, I don't know enough about video specs.
3700120	3703360	They don't need HDMI to do 1080p.
3703360	3710080	It's just HDMI is going to be required when they digitally sign, when a digital broadcast
3710080	3712120	flag goes into effect in a few years.
3712120	3714640	Why do I need HDMI over component?
3714640	3717760	Is it just that much clearer of a picture, like component over S-video?
3717760	3719200	I believe so.
3719200	3724440	And also, I'm not sure, I can't remember if component can do 1080p.
3724440	3725440	I think it can.
3725440	3726960	I need to read up on Wikipedia.
3726960	3730840	But I know HDMI, though, the big thing, and I think this is kind of one of the reasons
3730840	3736880	why they added it to the lower end PS3 model, too, is so that they can support the broadcast
3736880	3743480	flag for the movies and stuff, because otherwise, you know, in like 2009 or whenever this broadcast
3743480	3748480	flag goes into effect, all your movies are going to be dropped down to 540p, and that's
3748480	3751320	the highest they will go if you're watching Blu-ray.
3751320	3753800	Jeremy Todd 1 has an interesting comment in chat.
3753800	3756520	I'm sick of all this 1080p versus 1080i bullshit.
3756520	3759800	95% of people won't even be able to tell the difference between the two.
3759800	3761400	This is just an E-penis sort of thing.
3761400	3762400	It is.
3762400	3765160	Basically, you're not going to notice the difference unless you have a TV that's over
3765160	3768960	like 48 inches and you're sitting six feet away.
3768960	3774000	Anoush, do you own any next-gen systems yet?
3774000	3775000	No.
3775000	3776400	Are you planning on purchasing any of them?
3776400	3779280	Yeah, I think I might go for a Wii and a PS3.
3779280	3780520	A Wii and a PS3?
3780520	3784080	So this doesn't sway you being somebody who wants to get a PS3?
3784080	3787880	This doesn't sway you in Xbox's direction any?
3787880	3790280	I kind of swore not to get an Xbox.
3790280	3792040	Ooh, why's this?
3792040	3794080	Um, totally against Microsoft.
3794080	3795080	Okay, okay.
3795080	3797560	Well, I know a lot of people who are in that camp.
3797560	3798680	They just really don't want to...
3798680	3802600	You know, I used to be in that camp, too, but I've got to say, there were just some
3802600	3807040	of the games towards the end of the first Xbox run really finally convinced me that
3807040	3811280	I needed to check it out, and I've been pretty happy with it.
3811280	3816280	You know what I say, the system is only as good as the games that are on it.
3816280	3820360	Let me guess, Anoush, are you a role-playing type fan?
3820360	3823320	Those are your types of games, the games that Microsoft kind of lacks on?
3823320	3824880	Not really.
3824880	3827960	I'm more into racing games and FPS.
3827960	3829760	Hmm, interesting.
3829760	3834000	And yet you still don't like Xbox 360, because that's pretty much all they have right now.
3834000	3835000	That's interesting.
3835000	3836000	That's true.
3836000	3837000	Okay, interesting.
3837000	3838880	Well, I mean, you're free to like what you like.
3838880	3840040	There's no problem.
3840040	3844280	But I was just kind of curious on your thoughts on how 1080p might sway your thoughts on that
3844280	3846020	one way or the other.
3846020	3848840	It wasn't really the 1080p that makes me want the PS3.
3848840	3850800	It's more of like a fanboy thing.
3850800	3852160	Okay, okay.
3852160	3853760	Well, that's funny.
3853760	3857000	What games are you looking forward to on PS3?
3857000	3862840	Gran Turismo HD, from what you guys said, I'm kind of swaying against that now.
3862840	3866560	Yeah, I was going to say, what does this whole microtransactions thing do to your opinion
3866560	3868120	on that?
3868120	3874880	Yeah, I'm kind of thinking that maybe Sony will give you like a points card with the
3874880	3875880	game.
3875880	3876880	I hope so.
3876880	3881080	And you can download whatever you like, like so many points.
3881080	3882080	We'll see.
3882080	3886240	You know what's funny is that a lot of people are talking about Wii 60 was this big thing.
3886240	3887600	So we're going to get the Wii 60.
3887600	3891280	And now I'm Mr. Gohan in chat saying it should be Wii S3.
3891280	3892960	So you're in the Wii S3 camp.
3892960	3894560	Yeah, I guess so.
3894560	3895560	All right.
3895560	3896560	Sounds good.
3896560	3897560	Go register WiiS3.com before someone else does.
3897560	3898560	Okay.
3898560	3899560	All right, Anoush, take care.
3899560	3900560	Yeah, you too.
3900560	3901560	Bye-bye.
3901560	3902560	Thanks.
3902560	3904640	Let's go to another call.
3904640	3905640	Let's go to this call.
3905640	3908920	Too much feedback on that call.
3908920	3911600	You got to fix your output settings there.
3911600	3915760	You can always call if you're a first time Skype caller, Echo123 is the name that you
3915760	3916760	can call there.
3916760	3920320	And you can hear yourself and see how you sound.
3920320	3921320	Let's go to this call.
3921320	3922320	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3922320	3923320	Who's this?
3923320	3924320	Holy crap.
3924320	3925320	You scared the crap out of me.
3925320	3926320	It's DMN.
3926320	3927320	Boo.
3927320	3928320	Hi, DMN.
3928320	3929320	Ah.
3929320	3930320	What's on your mind?
3930320	3933640	Actually, something you guys haven't talked about today.
3933640	3935320	His skull is on his mind.
3935320	3945800	The totally unprofessional comments about Sony calling the Xbox 360's HD DVD drive quote-unquote
3945800	3947040	unfortunate.
3947040	3954360	I don't have the link to the article handy, but basically, Sony said your HD DVD drive
3954360	3960160	sucks and we're better in a very unprofessional sort of way, yet very business-like.
3960160	3964680	Everybody's just waving their cocks around, I mean.
3964680	3972020	The marketplace will choose the ultimate victor and then I believe bragging rights can be
3972020	3973020	bestowed.
3973020	3976640	But yeah, it's just they're talking trash because they're trying to talk their own thing
3976640	3979140	up because it's coming out soon.
3979140	3980140	But I don't know.
3980140	3982560	I'm going to be perfectly honest with you.
3982560	3987240	My friend and I went into a Best Buy this week and finally, after all this time, I got
3987240	3992200	to see an HD DVD and a Blu-Ray side by side.
3992200	3996640	And I'll tell you what, I have to say I think the Blu-Ray did look a little better.
3996640	4001160	But there are some other factors to take into consideration here because my friend who was
4001160	4006900	with me, David, said the other TV's kind of crappy and plus they're playing ultraviolet
4006900	4011640	on the Blu-Ray, which is as crappy as the movie is, I'm sure, is meant to look very
4011640	4016160	stylish and cool, whereas over here you're getting like the Manchurian Candidate or something
4016160	4018880	that's not really action-packed.
4018880	4021880	So I don't know.
4021880	4026760	My first impression did tell me that, you know what, Blu-Ray was a little prettier.
4026760	4028600	Blu-Ray is a little prettier but a little pricier.
4028600	4035600	Like HD DVD players, I think, run at the cheapest around $500, whereas Blu-Rays are like $1,000.
4035600	4039200	This is beta versus VHS all over again, all over again.
4039200	4042880	You know, I read somewhere and I think we had to cut it from our show roll, but Loki,
4042880	4045360	maybe you'd remember this because I think you were the one that posted it in our super
4045360	4050680	secret thread, something about some company was going to be making discs that did both
4050680	4052160	HD DVD and Blu-Ray.
4052160	4053320	It's Warner.
4053320	4056440	They patented technology, I guess.
4056440	4061040	It's DVD, Blu-Ray, and HD all in one.
4061040	4062040	Smart.
4062040	4064760	And I imagine they're going to use it for their movies.
4064760	4065760	Smart.
4065760	4069760	So no matter what format it goes, they're supporting it.
4069760	4074960	I think that's a great idea, but I'd rather it go to one format or another.
4074960	4081160	They already have the hybrid discs with the HD DVD and DVD, you know, one side's HD and
4081160	4090040	the other side's not, so I wish this whole format war thing would end and just come up
4090040	4091040	with something.
4091040	4093600	We'll see what happens.
4093600	4098160	Anything else you wanted to say, Diemen?
4098160	4099840	You're cutting out there, my friend.
4099840	4100840	There you go.
4100840	4101840	Sorry.
4101840	4103120	It's rubbing my face.
4103120	4106880	I just posted a link in the chat room if anybody wants to take a look at that.
4106880	4109040	What is it?
4109040	4111720	GameSpot dot something dot, I don't care.
4111720	4115200	I know, but what is it that I'm going to look at if I pull this up?
4115200	4119200	It's the article regarding Sony talking their shit.
4119200	4121800	Well, this is close to launch.
4121800	4124320	Who wouldn't want to whip it out?
4124320	4125320	Let's see.
4125320	4130160	Quote from Dave Caracker, the Senior Director of Corporate Communications for Sony Computer
4130160	4135280	Entertainment America, quote, it's unfortunate that Microsoft's external HD DVD drive will
4135280	4138440	not enhance the experience at all for the gamer.
4138440	4143000	Sony realizes that to truly take gaming into the next generation requires a larger data
4143000	4144960	format for both games and movies.
4144960	4149280	PS3 uses the Blu-ray format for gaming, giving developers 50 gigabytes of high definition
4149280	4153960	storage on a single disc, while Microsoft's 9 gigabyte DVD gaming format is an obstacle
4153960	4155800	for storing HD content.
4155800	4158040	Sounds like typical cock waving to me.
4158040	4162080	It's not like he said, God, the 360's a piece of shit.
4162080	4163080	True.
4163080	4164680	This is more the point and laugh tactic.
4164680	4170920	Yeah, this is just more the trying to emphasize what's good about theirs and how it outshines
4170920	4172920	the other one.
4172920	4175960	Well, that was about it.
4175960	4176960	You guys have a good night.
4176960	4177960	All right, you too, buddy.
4177960	4178960	Thanks for the topic.
4178960	4179960	All right.
4179960	4180960	Bye-bye.
4180960	4181960	Bye.
4181960	4183160	Wow, callers are calling in with lots of good things we should have been thinking about
4183160	4184160	earlier.
4184160	4185160	Let's do one more call.
4185160	4188080	I know some other folks are trying to get through, but we got to wrap it up here pretty
4188080	4189080	soon.
4189080	4190080	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4190080	4191080	Who's this?
4191080	4192080	Good to meet you, 83.
4192080	4193720	Hi, you're a little bit quiet.
4193720	4196520	Try to get a little closer to your mic if you can and tell us what's on your mind.
4196520	4200120	Yeah, my mic's a little quiet.
4200120	4201120	What's on your mind?
4201120	4202120	24 the game.
4202120	4204360	Oh, 24 the game.
4204360	4206120	What about it?
4206120	4208240	It's pretty good.
4208240	4210160	Is this something you just picked up this week?
4210160	4212160	No, I won it.
4212160	4214200	Oh, that's right.
4214200	4217920	Okay, well, it's a pretty good game?
4217920	4220960	The game's okay, but the cutscenes are pretty good.
4220960	4221960	Yeah?
4221960	4222960	How is it if you're a fan of the show?
4222960	4229240	Oh, if you're a fan of the show, you definitely got to try it.
4229240	4230740	What kind of game is it?
4230740	4233700	For those that don't know what to expect out of 24 the game, what kind of game could you
4233700	4234700	compare it to?
4234700	4235700	It's a third-person shooter.
4235700	4241420	There's a few minigames in it, and there's some really crappy driving in it.
4241420	4242960	Really crappy driving in it?
4242960	4247360	Yeah, it's the worst driving I've ever played, but the rest of it's pretty good.
4247360	4248360	All right, awesome.
4248360	4252160	Well, I'm glad you've had a chance to check that out.
4252160	4254600	You're a little bit quiet, so I've got to keep this short, but is there anything else
4254600	4258240	you want to share with our listeners?
4258240	4259240	Not really.
4259240	4260760	All right, well, have a good one and enjoy the game.
4260760	4262280	Yeah, see you.
4262280	4263280	Bye-bye.
4263280	4266600	A little minigame review there on the Skype line, but that's what it's for.
4266600	4269640	You guys can call in and tell us your thoughts on things.
4269640	4270640	We appreciate it.
4270640	4272160	Sorry to those folks that didn't get through tonight.
4272160	4273680	I'll try again next week.
4273680	4274880	What can I say?
4274880	4278440	Any other last-minute stories here in studio?
4278440	4282720	In other news, I'm still awesome.
4282720	4284760	Was anyone ever questioning that Dark Sakura?
4284760	4289440	No, I just have to keep making a mention.
4289440	4291720	But if you disagree, send us an email.
4291720	4294320	If you disagree, keep it to yourself.
4294320	4295320	All right.
4295320	4296760	Anything from you, Loki?
4296760	4298320	I'm trying to think.
4298320	4300080	I know there was some other stuff I had.
4300080	4306160	I'm looking real quick here, because I shut down my list, because I suck.
4306160	4309280	I'm trying to think here.
4309280	4311680	Let's see.
4311680	4312680	Great radio.
4312680	4316040	Yeah, I think we might have to wrap it up if you don't have anything else.
4316040	4318040	Okay, here we go.
4318040	4320000	Well, a couple of small things.
4320000	4322680	There was a couple of stories.
4322680	4326160	First off, no PlayStation 2 version of Grand Theft Auto Vice City stories coming out.
4326160	4327160	That makes me sad.
4327160	4328160	None at all?
4328160	4329160	None at all.
4329160	4335360	I'm not sure why, but there isn't one, so that's kind of interesting.
4335360	4341600	Microsoft announced that they're doing Platinum Hits on the Xbox 360, and the first four titles,
4341600	4345720	three of which already have a price drop on the $29.99, which is going to be the price
4345720	4351120	point for the Platinum Hits, the fourth title is going to be Need for Speed Most Wanted,
4351120	4354200	which is why I borrowed that back from you, because I got to beat that to sell it back
4354200	4358040	before they drop the price, which is interesting.
4358040	4364500	And then, what was the other one, I was going to say, oh yeah, they're working on a new
4364500	4370680	Metal Gear Solid digital comic, based on Metal Gear Solid 2 in Japan, so that would be pretty
4370680	4371680	cool.
4371680	4377840	And, what was the other one, oh, Square's working on Front Mission for the DS, so that
4377840	4379600	should be pretty neat.
4379600	4381880	I have some news actually for our UK listeners.
4381880	4383000	What's that?
4383000	4389800	Anyone who is looking for Football Manager 2007, there's a demo being released on Sunday,
4389800	4395560	1st October for PC, Mac, and Intel Mac.
4395560	4399400	To quote on here, the vanilla version will include English and Scottish quick starts,
4399400	4404360	English language only, with limited assets, logo and player, pictures, etc.
4404360	4408360	This will be available from the News of the World website in conjunction with Play.com
4408360	4410360	to try and maximize the bandwidth available.
4410360	4418400	The link to this will of course be on SiGames.com when it's released at midnight.
4418400	4423800	The Strawberry version, that's kind of funny, will include extra quick starts and extra
4423800	4425800	languages to be confirmed with more assets.
4425800	4432600	This will be available initially as a torrent only, also at midnight from www.sigames.com.
4432600	4434920	So anyone's interested in that?
4434920	4439680	Speaking of London, or the UK listeners, there's actually going to be a London's Game Festival
4439680	4444280	kicking off on October 2nd, and it runs through the 7th.
4444280	4447040	It's going to be, you know, you're going to be able to play tons of games.
4447040	4448720	That's a long festival, five days.
4448720	4453840	Oh yeah, you're going to be able to play tons of games at a special set up at Oxford Street's
4453840	4460040	HMV, plus there's going to be various other events and venues and showcases going on around
4460040	4461600	the same time.
4461600	4465580	Some other fun things to note, at the Tokyo Game Show they were showing off some different
4465580	4475560	colored PSPs, one including a camo, as well as red, yellow, and green PSPs, or I'm sorry,
4475560	4483280	red, blue, and yellow PSPs, all with metallic sheens to them, and another fun one I thought
4483280	4488000	of, Devil May Cry, this being made into an anime.
4488000	4489600	Should be interesting.
4489600	4491720	That should be pretty cool.
4491720	4496840	All right, well, it's about time we wrap up this program for tonight, and wait until next
4496840	4498800	week for more gaming news.
4498800	4501720	Let's go around, though, first and get everyone's final thought.
4501720	4504800	Drunami, thanks again for being here, as always.
4504800	4505800	What's your final thought?
4505800	4506800	Food.
4506800	4507800	All right.
4507800	4509040	Loki, your final thought?
4509040	4513680	My final thought is, and I forgot to mention, Unreal Tournament 2007 for the PlayStation
4513680	4515640	3 will support mods.
4515640	4516640	Hot.
4516640	4518720	DarkSakura, your final thought?
4518720	4519720	Food.
4519720	4522740	I've eaten nothing but bagels today.
4522740	4525080	My final thought is, cookie.
4525080	4526080	I did.
4526080	4527080	Cookies.
4527080	4528080	I brought cookies.
4528080	4529080	All right.
