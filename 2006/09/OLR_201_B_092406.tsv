5891	14738	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15459	19141	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20623	25747	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 201 for this September the 24th of 2006.
28252	45318	and we've got a case of the giggles sorry about that but that's part of our live segment that you can only hear when you listen to us live sorry podcast fans we have to do something special for the live listeners whether it be here on OrangeLaunchRadio.com or AllGames.com anyway we're going to get back into the news now however and I'm going to start off this segment of news
45683	46825	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
63947	66709	The console will be coming to New Zealand on December 7th.
67190	69932	Wii Sports will be a pack-in game, just like here in the US.
70433	79602	It will cost 499 New Zealand dollars, which translates to about 261 euros, 330 American dollars.
80162	84466	So, by the way, New Zealand is actually having to pay a little bit more than Australia for that.
85047	85227	Dope.
86774	90476	But at least you get in the console relatively early and not getting the shaft on release dates.
90536	93418	So, you know, at least that's some consolation, I hope.
93679	94099	I don't know.
94599	94900	I guess.
95260	98042	Does it just strike me funny that consolation is almost a pun?
99923	101865	Consolation, yeah.
102085	107669	Anyways, some of the news we actually talked about a while back was how the Wii wasn't going to have a digital audio out port.
107829	112052	And we were wondering why that, you know, I think I made the point that that wasn't really important.
112933	113173	Well...
113973	123661	In the case now, it really isn't important because we found out that we will only be supporting Dolby ProLogic 2 technology.
123961	130626	So, you know, you can just use your standard red and white audio cables for that kind of stuff.
131347	135630	But I guess it's cool that it has some sort of quasi-surround sound to it.
135670	143396	I mean, not that it really needs too much since it has the speaker and the controller which I guess they could use for some semi-surround sound, but
144764	145164	Whatever.
145204	149825	I mean, it's not a surprise when the game isn't, you know, HD, you know, really anyways.
150265	151626	Maybe it's just me.
151946	156607	And let me go out here on a limb, and I'm sure to piss somebody off with this, you know, thing I'm about to say, but whatever.
156927	157467	It's my view.
158527	165269	I don't really get all like, oh, gosh, the sound in this game was so crystal clear amazing.
165589	173731	Wow, when I shot that guy in the face, I could really hear that in full, you know, 31.11 surround super uber Dolby sound or whatever.
174215	174715	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
193815	213572	After having played games in Surround Sound, oh hell yeah, especially for anything that's scary, where those little side noises are gonna... Especially since you've got your speaker in the Wii controller, having that full Surround Sound... Okay, do you want to go see your movie in just mono, or do you want to see it in Surround Sound?
215734	216915	Well, I mean, it depends.
216935	218196	If I'm watching a comedy...
218911	219632	It doesn't really matter.
219752	224275	If you have the capability to play it in surround sound, don't you want the full effect?
224315	233882	It is kind of weird, though, that it does have a speaker in the controller, because they're trying to make it more immersive, and yet they're not supporting immersive sound.
234343	234843	I don't know.
235303	236344	Let me phrase it this way.
236424	240547	I've never had a crappy sound system take the game experience away from me, I guess.
240607	243649	Maybe I've just played the wrong games on those uber surround systems.
243689	248113	I really haven't played a lot of survival horror on those systems, so maybe I'm just not playing the right games.
248153	248433	I don't know.
249517	250198	It could be the game.
250558	266384	Well, if it isn't much of a surprise, of course, the same info came out this week that Dolby is also going to be providing the sound technology for the PlayStation 3, including Dolby Digital's 5.1 surround, and you better believe that they're going to be pushing this crap.
266404	271586	Sony will also be supporting Dolby's true HD sound for decoding up to 7.1 channels.
273462	276985	for playback of movie titles in the Blu-ray disc format and probably games.
277345	280628	So I think that's kind of interesting, you know, that they're supporting this technology.
281128	291938	They're probably going to be pushing those wonderful Sony 7.1 systems now so you can get your 7.1 system and your 1080p, you know, plasma screen TV and spend uber money on stuff that you probably don't need.
292158	292598	Screw that.
292638	295741	If you want something good, get a Harman Kardon and Bose surround speakers.
296862	297562	No contest.
298463	299464	That's what we've got in my house.
300925	301686	Anyway, um...
302407	307588	Something that actually is cool for some if you manage to get in on it and not so cool for others.
308348	312589	Amazon has sold out of pre-orders for the Wii.
313489	313729	Yep.
314509	314869	No more.
315629	317930	So go to your GameStop and wait until they do pre-orders.
318070	319470	Well, how long was that up?
319550	319950	An hour?
319990	320410	Two hours?
321710	323111	We probably had to shut that off pretty quick.
323951	325251	It was about a couple hours.
325411	328611	And the reason why they stopped pre-orders is because they don't have their allocations yet.
328631	329492	They don't know what they're getting.
329652	331812	So they're going to restart pre-orders once they figure that out.
332586	335088	It was kind of an error, I guess, on taking the pre-orders right now.
336008	340751	Well, I can tell you right now, at least as far as I've last asked, GameStop's not taking pre-orders on them yet.
341031	342332	Yeah, I've been calling them every day.
342352	344053	Because I'm annoying.
344454	345634	I ask my husband every day.
346235	348396	Do they know you by name when you call?
348416	356121	No, they don't, but I always preface the call with, I'm sorry to ask this, but, you know, because I'm sure they get the call, like 700 calls.
356141	359263	Don't you think news will hit the internet when they're going to start taking pre-orders?
359960	365825	Yeah, but I want to know first because I don't want to hear it from second hand because then people already know and they're already there.
366066	368748	I'd rather call them right when they open up and say, hey, are you taking pre-orders?
369088	370470	Okay, I'll tell you this.
371050	376015	As soon as I find out when GameStop is taking pre-orders, we will have an announcement.
377381	379842	So as soon as I can actually say something.
380582	382863	You think we'll be able to beat some of the big boys to it?
382903	383243	I don't know.
383823	384224	Maybe.
384484	384924	We'll see.
385324	385624	All right.
385724	387365	Seeing as how I hear all the drama that goes on.
387985	389446	Oh, you should share some of that drama with us.
389466	390846	I can't share some of the drama.
390966	392107	Damn, what kind of radio is that?
393107	393427	All right.
394728	399690	Well, one thing that's causing a little bit of drama, as you know, last week we talked about, oh, the Wii is region free.
399730	400830	Oh, it's not region free.
401235	403217	It's free, it's not free, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
403517	408101	Well, it looks like there are plenty more votes for not region-free.
408621	418489	In fact, representatives from Nintendo of America confirmed to 1UP.com earlier this week that the Wii will be region-encoded by territory.
419029	420150	Wah, wah.
420531	427016	Which means, unfortunately, if you want to play Japanese Wii games, you will have to purchase a Japanese Wii or wait for a hack.
427990	428710	It will be there.
428831	431972	It will either be a physical one or something as simple as a disc.
432893	440276	Because it seems to me that if this is like a last-minute decision by them, that it's going to be something half-assed for the reason of protection.
441017	448280	I really don't see why they're putting so much effort into it since they've never really given half a crap before because it's always been something easy.
448460	455704	Anyway, Nintendo, if you're listening, Reggie, if you're listening to our podcast...
456801	457221	Why?
457742	458202	You know what?
458262	459563	And here's evidence.
460203	466146	If Nintendo is listening to this, here's evidence that Region Free will work.
466887	467947	Elite Beat Agents.
468147	470488	I will bet you anything that game sells like hotcakes.
470669	471009	Why?
471349	477492	Because so many people purchased the import version and let their friends play it that I bet that game is going to sell like crazy.
477872	481775	Wouldn't have happened if you didn't have the Region Free DS.
482175	482975	That wouldn't have happened.
482995	486177	And I bet you Elite Beat Agents possibly wouldn't have even come out here.
488817	499360	It would make more sense to have a universal launch, have the same games come out, except for the really crappy American-centered games and the really quirky Japanese-centered games.
500240	505741	I think that region coding is pretty much going to shoot them in the ass.
505781	506682	It hasn't worked yet.
507702	510283	It's interesting because some folks in the chat room are saying, you know what?
510983	511723	I still don't believe it.
513688	518632	So what if this big, foofy website called their rep at Nintendo?
518973	520054	Reps have been wrong before.
521175	521635	Interesting.
522116	528081	So I guess there is a little bit of hope that perhaps this system could possibly still be region-free.
528181	528742	I hope so.
529422	530864	Reggie, if you're listening, I love you, dude.
531424	532345	Please make it region-free.
532986	536929	I don't think... It'd be nice, but I don't think they will.
537890	538230	I don't know.
538371	538751	We'll see.
540083	541024	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
559276	561597	and cutesy Elebits and Pokemon.
561617	562877	No, no, no, it's Grand Theft Auto.
563097	563898	Oh, wait, no, I'm sorry.
563918	564918	I thought you were talking about Nintendo.
564978	566739	Nintendo's usually known for the cutesy games.
566759	570880	There is nothing I want more in this world to be able to beat a hooker with a Wiimote.
571600	579223	That is going to be the... I will be able to die after doing that.
579803	580423	You probably will.
582303	585225	What they need to add is like, you know, Pimp Slap with the Wii Remote.
585285	586546	I mean, it'll be just awesome.
587066	590068	I cannot wait for, you know, them to actually put out something.
590828	596091	Although they're probably going to bring out fucking Table Tennis for the... Hey, now wait a minute, wait a minute.
596651	598612	Table Tennis with the Wii Con could be pretty rad.
598693	599793	Don't knock it until you've tried it.
600213	601114	That might be kind of fun.
603081	608342	I want Table Tennis Extreme where I can take off people's heads with the fucking ball.
608482	609062	That'd be cool.
609242	611503	We need freaking wire work ping pong.
612043	614363	You can do clips and shit with the ball.
616143	616503	I don't know.
616803	627405	But, you know, I'm glad at least they're opening it up for M-rated games to hopefully remove this kind of impression that Nintendo is only for kids.
627605	631126	Because I think this console would be a lot better if they just get past that.
631550	633731	and publishers realize, okay, this is going to appeal to everybody.
634312	636433	Including people that like to beat hookers with a stick.
638114	642717	GS191 in our chatroom says, oh great, hot coffee mod with Wiimote functionality.
644078	644878	What do you do?
645619	647000	Stroke the Wiimote?
647420	648181	Does it have a sensor on the side?
648241	649742	I don't think it has a sensor for that.
649982	650902	They'll have an attachment.
650922	651022	Gross.
651042	651182	Gross!
651222	651443	Gross!
658109	660210	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
692115	694196	My first FU of the week.
694636	696957	It's actually a very serious matter.
697017	703060	I found out today that my cousin-in-law died from AIDS.
704020	708462	He developed pneumonia, fell into a coma two weeks ago, and they pulled life support today.
708982	714665	So I'd just like to say a big FU to communicable diseases and people who don't take proper precautions.
715805	717966	I don't know if that was his case, but I'm just saying...
719759	724524	Everybody, just please make sure either do it safely or don't do it at all.
725845	726946	Take the proper precautions.
728347	728948	Sorry to hear that.
730129	730429	Loki.
732231	737996	My FQs of the week, or I should say FQ of the week, goes to a local church actually nearby here.
738256	743441	There was a story that came out that they were, basically the city has
744501	771569	Told them that they cannot have their Christian rock bands come in anymore Because they have this thing going on during the weekends called Club Retro or some crap like that Where they have bands come in and stuff and they worship and whatever crap they do Anyways, so this has been going on for years now And they've received numerous complaints because they are too noisy So they have filed basically this thing saying that Well, you're running a nightclub
772173	799274	Basically in this church, and this area is not zoned for a nightclub Plus you are being too noisy and there's too much problem with littering You guys are praying too loud Exactly, and so they're doing this silent protest in front of the church Saying that this is unfair, that they're taking away their right to worship And I say they're fucking retarded Because they know exactly why they are being, you know
799983	803584	If you're worshipping someone who's omniscient and omnipresent, you can go, thanks God, and God will hear you.
829110	833632	You can raise a joyful noise unto the Lord, but don't do it to where your neighbors wake up.
833792	839915	I would like nothing more for them to lose their ability to actually have this rock band that would make me so super happy.
840915	841976	And that's probably what's going to happen.
842676	843396	Go government!
845197	846298	Wow.
846338	848458	We should get some emails on that one.
848779	853280	My FU of the week, I was going to do this big old thing, but I'm just going to pass this week.
854521	856802	I'm mad at a lot of things, but it's really none of your business.
857395	858296	So, that's it.
859316	859896	Drew Nami.
859996	862358	And finally, I'm sorry, I had to step in here real quick.
863058	865319	Fuck you, Microsoft, for your crappy vision camera.
865339	868961	Because I cannot focus this thing for... I bet you it's just defective.
868981	869922	It's just crap.
870622	871482	Alright, Drew Nami.
872303	875424	Alright, first of all, this game, games related FU.
876045	880307	FU to the fucking stealth segments in Dirge of Cerberus.
880747	884069	I fucking hate it when otherwise good action games
884798	886980	Suddenly lapses in this forced stealth segment.
887060	887380	Fuck it.
887520	887981	It sucks.
888641	889622	I hate stealth games.
890023	894466	I will never be good at a stealth game, so why force me into these stealth segments?
895207	901312	And second of all, FU2, the current arcade management at local Country Club Lane.
902153	905055	I went there yesterday with Dark Studio from Chatroom.
906397	911341	They had no less than five machines out of order, including In the Groove and several racing games.
911846	912547	Thanks for watching!
935839	938060	Let's get back into the gaming news, shall we?
938760	942601	Sure, and we have some news for our UK listeners.
942681	949363	The PAL version of Final Fantasy XII will be out in early 2007.
951424	954584	In the US, of course, the release date is October 31st.
956645	958366	But I think it's funny.
958666	963447	There's a quote by the Square Enix CEO of Europe.
964228	968951	John Yamamoto saying that it looks set to become one of the crowning glories of PlayStation 2.
969671	970532	That makes me laugh.
971132	974034	Because I don't really think that Final Fantasy XII is all that fantastic.
974154	975615	The battle system in it is kind of bizarre.
976155	979877	However, you can probably see videos of it online.
981178	987601	You play through as a princess and some dude hanging out with her to try to rescue their home.
988242	988762	And it has...
989904	991064	It's called Active Battle.
991224	994985	Fucking A, that's the exact same plot of Enchanted Arms right now, actually.
996066	997186	I swear to God, it is.
997506	1002227	It has a real-time exploration and this active dimension battle thing.
1003448	1009029	Basically, you have this big line that comes from you to whatever your target is, and it's really stupid.
1009369	1011590	And then your command screen pops up, and you can do that.
1011610	1012550	You can switch your targets.
1013590	1014830	No, it doesn't work.
1015671	1016411	I liked it, FYI.
1018486	1021527	I tried really hard to give it a chance.
1021567	1022428	And I'm going to get the game.
1023388	1028970	But I also love Final Fantasy XI, and you thought you were going to go crazy.
1028990	1031050	I gave Final Fantasy XI a chance.
1031070	1031350	You did.
1031931	1033471	Did I make it to level 24, White Mage?
1035032	1035312	You did.
1035432	1035712	I know.
1036752	1039453	But you do talk a lot of shit about Final Fantasy XI.
1039493	1040353	Yeah, at least you tried it.
1040393	1040913	I'll give you that.
1041133	1045875	See, I have room to talk shit about people who abuse their White Mages.
1047569	1049010	White mages are people too!
1049210	1049690	Heal, please.
1050850	1051270	Fuck you.
1051890	1052370	Heal, please.
1052650	1053171	Port, please.
1054191	1054931	No, no, no, no, no.
1054951	1059472	Because, see, I decided... My last party, I got revenge.
1059512	1061493	I let our tank die, and then I killed all the critters.
1061693	1062913	Because I was subbing Black Mage.
1062933	1066294	You are a heal bot.
1067714	1068775	No, I'm not a heal bot.
1069455	1070555	I'm a Black Mage in disguise.
1070595	1070975	Heal, please.
1071415	1071775	Shut up!
1071895	1072435	Regen, please.
1073116	1074516	You know, that's why I will not... Please.
1075160	1076921	That is why I will not play Priests in Ragnarok.
1077602	1083487	Because, at least with a Priest in Ragnarok, you can do random teleports and drop people in glass time.
1084507	1085228	Okay, okay.
1085949	1087490	I've gotta agree with you on that.
1087990	1092914	When I played Ragnarok Online with you, what did I say to everyone?
1093394	1094215	I don't heal.
1094495	1096116	I'm a battle alkali.
1096697	1096897	Yep.
1097297	1098318	And now you can actually take Monk.
1098999	1100460	Yes, and that fucking kicks ass.
1102449	1104290	I should start playing... I am no one's heel box.
1104310	1108853	I'm going to start playing Ragnarok again because I have my level 50-something assassin.
1109153	1109693	Oh, I remember her.
1109913	1110554	Well, have fun.
1110594	1112615	Meanwhile, I'll be playing Final Fantasy XII.
1112735	1113075	Addict!
1113435	1115276	Traitor addict!
1115457	1116957	Before all our fans in Europe.
1117758	1118298	Sorry, guys.
1118358	1121720	And I'll still be playing World of Warcraft after my burnout wears off.
1122300	1123741	You are a TA.
1123761	1124101	Hold on.
1124361	1124702	Hold on.
1124782	1126963	Did I not say in Part A that I went back to WoW?
1128103	1130805	I haven't touched Final Fantasy XI in two weeks and Shane's very mad at me for that.
1131676	1132576	So give me that.
1133536	1135097	And then I'm going to play Final Fantasy XII.
1135457	1137117	I'm going to play it before our British friends.
1137177	1139417	Sorry, guys, but I just can't wait any longer.
1139898	1141118	I'll let you all know how it is, though.
1141658	1143698	And, yeah, that's it.
1143898	1148139	Well, damn, Rob, where MMOs are concerned, you can't do anything without pissing someone off, can you?
1148179	1149899	That means you're a bipolar MMO-er.
1151200	1151580	I guess.
1151740	1153020	Not that there's anything wrong with that.
1153040	1154400	Right?
1154740	1155100	All right.
1156781	1157621	You know what's interesting?
1158288	1162952	I love Final Fantasy so much, yet I still have not watched Final Fantasy VII Advent Children.
1163413	1167656	I don't know why, I just can't frickin' sit down for an hour and a half to watch it.
1167877	1168597	This you must do.
1169218	1180228	Well, anyway, actually, what's been going on is that at Tokyo Game Show, Square Enix has revealed a new version of Final Fantasy VII Advent Children with the subtitle, Complete, is going to be released.
1181589	1181709	It's...
1182356	1183117	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1213332	1219415	Now I have to find somebody who owns a Blu-ray player or camp out and watch it at Best Buy or something on the TV there.
1220135	1221356	That's awesome.
1221756	1224318	I can't wait to see that.
1224698	1229820	Anyways, there's one thing we talked about last week, which was the Kingdom Hearts Final Mix.
1231021	1236884	That is actually going to be including a PlayStation 2 remake of Chain of Memories in it as well.
1237724	1241306	So you will be able to get some nice...
1242679	1244100	Chain of Memories is actually going on.
1244861	1249704	I can tell from experience, by the way, that Chain of Memories on a Game Boy Micro is a pain in the ass.
1250985	1254928	But now you can play it on PlayStation 2, nice and big and huge and all that good stuff.
1255248	1258330	I can play it on my Macro and play it at work.
1258630	1259851	I mean, at school.
1260872	1267496	It says the game's going to feature full 3D graphics as well as some event cutscenes that will feature the voices in Japanese, not English.
1268357	1271279	And it says they were kind of scarce on the details.
1272500	1273261	Saga Loves Us Saga Loves Us
1288613	1290033	Um, Sega of America.
1290193	1290814	No, they don't.
1290834	1292434	They haven't put out Jumbo Safari.
1292774	1293694	Hey, you know what?
1293734	1296555	They're bringing a Shining Force EXA to PS2.
1297055	1298455	Alright, I guess I can give that.
1298675	1299896	Yeah, I love Shining Force.
1299956	1301076	I have the old ones.
1301276	1302616	It's my new background network.
1303397	1306217	There's a screenshot from Shining Force EXA.
1307337	1308718	I need a Jumbo Safari background.
1309398	1310318	Charm, please assist.
1310478	1313659	It's going to be an action RPG, um...
1314605	1329229	it's going to be taking more of the strategy lean although they're not giving any major specifics on that and there is no release date yet announced but it's Shining Force hey Shining Force is awesome
1331061	1336564	Alright, well, one thing that's not so awesome is a lawsuit, especially when you're on the receiving end.
1336624	1340166	And this week, the Ant Commandos have been on the receiving end of a lawsuit.
1340586	1347729	The Ant Commandos are a California-based company that sells Guitar Hero peripherals, specifically a wireless guitar controller.
1348049	1348610	Well, guess what?
1348670	1351111	Red Octane has come in and sued their asses.
1351584	1351724	Yeah.
1351744	1351864	Yeah.
1379727	1381668	However, I will say this.
1382548	1389152	At one point, didn't Konami officially recognize Red Octane as like their, you know, their cool?
1389572	1392433	We recognize them as like a pad manufacturer.
1392773	1394214	I want to say at one point they did.
1394334	1395735	On top of that, no.
1396155	1396975	I'm almost positive.
1396995	1397576	Red Octane didn't.
1397596	1399817	Until In The Groove came out, then all bets were off.
1399957	1406560	Red Octane also didn't actually go and use the official DDR logo on their product.
1407210	1410471	They didn't say, we are doing this for Konami.
1410571	1412592	The Konami logo didn't show up anywhere on there.
1413432	1418193	I've seen these wireless guitar controllers, and I played one, and it's complete ass.
1419234	1430477	So, if I were Red Octane, and this company is going out using our logo and our name, and putting out this utter crap product, I would definitely sue.
1430797	1434078	And the other side of it is just stupid, too, because...
1435190	1436211	Rob, you had more to that, didn't you?
1436231	1436812	Yes, I will.
1437052	1439154	Kage in our chatroom, I just wanted to say, made it funny.
1439314	1442596	I heard they hired Edgeworth to rep the prosecution side.
1445599	1446059	Beep!
1446279	1446760	Objection!
1447100	1447680	Objection!
1447880	1448221	Beep!
1448881	1449141	All right.
1450102	1452184	Not even Von Karma can make that argument work.
1452564	1457688	Well, the Ant Commandos were not going to take this lying down, and with a name like Ant Commandos, you wouldn't expect them to.
1458269	1459409	Don't they sound pretty hardcore?
1459550	1460931	They sound like a shitty indie band.
1460951	1461171	I know.
1461963	1470770	Well, the Ant Commandos actually have countersued Red Octane and given this timeline as their proof.
1471430	1475133	1999, Topway Electrical Appliances, a part owner of TAC, patents...
1475455	1478396	The Magical Guitar Controller for Konami's Guitar Freaks.
1478836	1482437	The design had five fret buttons, very similar to what Guitar Hero has now.
1482457	1492359	2001 to 2004, the CEO of Red Octane, as well as the sales manager, made several visits to a Topway factory in China and inquired about the Magical Guitar Controller.
1492739	1497840	From 2001 to 2004, Red Octane purchased several hundred Magical Guitar Controllers.
1498081	1503802	And in 2005, Red Octane releases Guitar Hero with a controller that looks exactly like the Magical Guitar.
1504789	1509393	I can't say that because they licensed the body shape for their guitars from Gibson.
1509813	1510193	Hold it.
1511854	1513936	I see a little bit of a flaw here.
1514496	1520781	Why would you make a guitar controller with five fret buttons for a guitar freak which only has three?
1521295	1522937	There was an Emco game.
1544062	1545563	I never understood why they did that either.
1545944	1546884	Now we know.
1547045	1552950	I don't know if it was arcade only, though, but I think there was a Namco... I know there's a Namco arcade guitar game.
1553410	1561837	I went digging through their Japanese site one time and found this and some type of keyboard sim that they did, too, but I didn't know if they ever had a home version of that.
1562718	1564279	If they did, then that makes sense.
1565460	1567382	Of course, if they had a home version of it, we would have heard of it.
1571165	1571686	Interesting.
1573747	1574088	I don't know.
1574888	1584732	I mean, besides the fact that Red Octane used to make DDR pads, does anyone find this kind of funny that they're using almost the same terminology as the whole Indigroove DDR thing?
1585032	1588574	Yeah, but technically, is the Indigroove thing against them?
1588894	1595577	That's technically what Rockstar, but I think Red Octane may fall into that a little bit because they distribute the home version.
1595857	1597758	I want to say they got pulled into some addendum.
1597818	1601780	It's been so long since we covered that case now, and we haven't really heard a lot on it, which is a little bit odd.
1602060	1602300	Yeah.
1602932	1607933	Search the court doc system and see if anything new has come out recently because there might have been a quiet settlement or something.
1608673	1609093	Who knows?
1609113	1611894	I think it would be very interesting if there was.
1611974	1612274	I don't know.
1613294	1618435	I'd like to thank the chat room for sending me various Jumbo Safari pictures for use on my background.
1618475	1619395	I appreciate that, folks.
1620256	1621476	God, I love OLR chatters.
1623156	1623496	All right.
1623556	1626157	Well, another thing we love is OLR emailers.
1626557	1631238	And every week you send your emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
1631906	1633346	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1657068	1657268	Wow, um...
1681844	1682285	Game Soundtracks
1702552	1706494	And sometimes you can find these at your local comic book store, I found.
1706854	1711415	Actually sells, at least the local one here now sells, anime and video game import CDs.
1711435	1713216	They've actually been selling them for quite a few years here.
1713496	1714456	Yeah.
1714917	1716617	And you've also got conventions.
1717658	1718038	That's true.
1718358	1720679	Your conventions, you've got online ordering.
1721059	1723600	I've ordered CDs through Amazon, actually.
1724020	1726181	I order all my UK Guerrilla stuff on Amazon.
1726201	1726561	Hmm.
1728017	1734365	another PS that's on here I'm going to Granville Island on October 3rd if you can tell me some details about the cookie shop
1735077	1739161	I would gladly purchase some cookies for OLR as a 200th gift and buy some for myself.
1739461	1746307	All I remember is that the guy who sold it sold nothing but maple stuff, which I'm sure in Canada, you know, is probably pretty common, sorry.
1747128	1754795	But I just remember the guy was right near an entrance, he sold nothing but maple stuff, and he had cookies were on one side, and he would give a free sample if you wanted it.
1755355	1757357	I'll take a picture of the box and put it on the forums.
1757397	1757758	How's that?
1757858	1758919	And that'll give you something to look for.
1759059	1760440	Because I might still have the box somewhere.
1760460	1761421	Send us some if we pay shipping.
1762108	1762688	I just might.
1763208	1764089	I like maple cookies.
1764349	1765149	Yeah, maple's delicious.
1766030	1770551	I need something to remind me of Vancouver, because I want to go back, but I'm poor.
1770911	1784757	Well, we also had a nice article sent to us by Robway, and it's on Planet Xbox 360, which came first, the violence or the video game.
1785744	1786485	And there it is.
1786565	1786825	Sweet.
1813215	1819279	And as far as the next mail is concerned, kind of a long one.
1819299	1821660	Hooray, long emails.
1822641	1825662	This is actually from McFloyd.
1825682	1835568	It says, Dear OLR crew, I've been listening to your podcast for over a year and a half now, so I thought it was really about time I expressed my thoughts on the show.
1836766	1837286	Wow, that's really sweet.
1837306	1837526	Thank you.
1860226	1860767	DarkSakura.com
1873789	1874330	Thank you so much.
1896845	1898666	This next part actually has a lot of good insight.
1899346	1902048	I wanted to comment on the gaming laws and people against video gaming.
1902328	1903428	You guys are completely right.
1903468	1905189	This is a violation of our First Amendment rights.
1905249	1908811	If this is a free country, people have to have the right to express themselves however they want.
1909191	1914093	By banning one thing, issues for similar things will come up and from those issues from other issues.
1914773	1916974	What about violent or sexually explicit movies or music?
1916994	1920796	Are we going to ban those things and make it illegal for a minor to possess them at all or to view them?
1921196	1924297	The government has no right to control what we see, what we hear, what we do.
1924958	1925238	Also,
1927181	1932223	Also, as being allowed to buy violent video games to play them, what will they do instead?
1932643	1935043	I believe we'll end up with more violence in real life.
1935524	1945846	The adults who are trying to get these laws passed neither understand video games nor see how video games are developing and are blindly scared of this new trend of kids playing these games more and more.
1946186	1951928	Video games are actually becoming more and more active with such games as DDR Guitar Hero and the Wii controllers evolving from previous ideas.
1953108	1958512	Basically, the email goes a little bit further into the educational games like Brain Age, Civilization.
1958892	1960033	You're a fan of Civilization.
1960073	1960853	Good job.
1961193	1962794	Games that are, you know, helping.
1962894	1964195	I like this person a lot.
1965216	1973541	I'd say if you're going to high school and have this type of insight, I am looking forward to see what you're like at a high school.
1973941	1976403	Well, consider what he said his dad does, too.
1976423	1978364	He's a diplomat, so it's kind of interesting.
1981179	1985782	That makes this insight especially interesting, knowing that the dad is in this very political position.
1986202	1987263	I like what's said here.
1987403	1991166	Adults should understand that this is... Let me get back to where I was.
1991746	1993127	Adults should understand that this is...
1993929	2002812	Just the New Age of People and help children choose games that are appropriate, active, or even educational if need be, helping them understand the issues in the more violent games.
2002872	2007874	Video games are very different from what they experienced as children, and learning by doing is the best way.
2007954	2013356	So video games have a huge potential in not only letting people have fun, but in teaching the things that they'll remember much better.
2016374	2026360	And the last paragraph, I'll just read that, it says, Finally, although this is just a little late, congratulations on your 200 episodes, so Loki, DarkSakura, Sky, keep up the great work, and I'm looking forward to 200 more episodes.
2027040	2027560	We'll try.
2029582	2035825	I would actually, if you're listening, I hope you are, I would actually like your permission to put this one up on our forum.
2035965	2036565	Letter of the Week!
2036806	2037246	Letter of the Week!
2038453	2040634	and not just because they kissed our ass, but it helps.
2041074	2043535	It's a very well thought out email.
2043715	2047997	I have a question for anyone that's in the chat room that might have an Xbox Live Vision camera.
2048077	2050178	Is it fucking blurry as mine is?
2050218	2060303	Because seriously, I cannot focus this thing no matter what kind of light is in the room, no matter if it's trying to focus something far away, close, it does not matter.
2060363	2061903	It's so goddamn blurry.
2061983	2067226	Goddamn, here we are trying to say something nice about a listener and it all comes back to me, me, me, me, me, doesn't it, Loki?
2067286	2067906	Yes, it does.
2069400	2070260	You selfish ass.
2071281	2072001	I'm just curious.
2073382	2074003	I just can't.
2074163	2075143	I want this thing to work.
2075623	2080226	I do want it to work so I can play Uno and make funny faces at people and stuff like that.
2080286	2086149	But I can't do that until it's not blurry because I just look like a fucking ghost in this thing.
2086249	2087110	So that doesn't work.
2087350	2090051	And once again, SSJ100Matter said, Loki, it's your face.
2090592	2093393	It's not my face because I pointed at you too and you're still blurry.
2093473	2094494	So tough.
2094514	2096275	But I'm beautiful.
2096355	2098316	That's what you get for watching the videotape.
2099119	2100640	Seven days you're going to die.
2100660	2107045	God punishing you because you're complaining about the praisers at the church making a lot of noise.
2107405	2109046	But he was messing with that beforehand.
2109146	2112589	I don't understand how I can clean the lens seeing as I just opened this thing up.
2112789	2114330	I mean, how would it be dirty already?
2114370	2115031	Hey, email.
2115471	2116011	Email's nice.
2117012	2117533	Yes, email.
2118513	2119434	Hi, OLR.
2119954	2120575	Hi, listener.
2120655	2121495	This is from DNL.
2122136	2122416	Oh, okay.
2122896	2123597	We love you, DNL.
2124935	2126219	Happy episode 201.
2126720	2131774	I know that I didn't get a chance to wish you guys a happy 200, but the biggest part of reaching a milestone is the aftermath.
2132888	2137770	Though I've only been on the show once, live at B3, when I met Rob for the first time.
2138270	2141011	Was that when me and Megumi decided to run away?
2141111	2141711	I think so.
2142972	2151095	B3 was this big DDR tournament that took place at Pier 39 in San Francisco, and this was probably in about our second year of existence that we did the B3 thing.
2151455	2155016	We weren't quite to 100 yet, but we were definitely getting old.
2156077	2157697	Megumi and I were really hungry.
2158437	2159118	I'll tell you what...
2160865	2170209	Doing live radio coverage for two days straight takes a lot of talent that I'm not so sure we all have.
2172530	2175732	Seriously, I wish I had recordings of some of that old stuff, and I just might somewhere.
2175772	2182815	But I seem to recall there was one DDR tournament that we covered that Loki ended up sitting in the back and he's just going, Yeah...
2183522	2185643	So, DDR tournament going on.
2186003	2188644	There was somebody sitting in the back row of the microphone.
2188724	2190925	Yeah, for hours, and I had a cold.
2191125	2193126	Oh, God, that was so funny.
2193146	2193987	That was a shaft.
2194287	2195047	What's it?
2195067	2196168	That was a shaft.
2196228	2196788	I hated it.
2196848	2198729	I was busy with the tournament and the fried Twinkies.
2199569	2202391	But no, Megumi and I ended up leaving the tournament.
2202411	2212235	And by the way, not meaning to cut in on the email, I would also like to give Megumi and her fiancé congratulations on their upcoming wedding.
2213061	2214002	Yay weddings!
2214162	2215643	Yay everybody getting married but me!
2218585	2220567	I make no comment.
2221508	2224390	Being married is not all it's cracked up to be.
2225311	2230255	Anyway, I've been listening on and off for three years, but started listening regularly as soon as there was a podcast.
2230635	2231836	That's right from the very beginning.
2232056	2233037	And Rob, he's so nice.
2233979	2246325	I had only seen him twice before, both at competitions, but when we bumped into each other, literally, at the Dear Friends concert before E3 2004, and he remembered my name and even introduced me to the awesome VXJasonXV, the amazing mod.
2246905	2249166	And then there was Roscoe's, but enough with the reminiscing.
2249486	2251387	Cheers to another X amount of episodes.
2253328	2255329	Renee is just the cutest girl you'll ever meet.
2255609	2257710	I mean, she's adorable.
2258290	2259390	You need to come on the show, Renee.
2259430	2260031	I know you're listening.
2260051	2260851	You need to come on the show.
2262172	2262692	I just, I want to...
2263400	2265300	RAD We love our international friends.
2292813	2295296	The last one is from Ranma.
2297459	2305328	Yes, Ranchan has decided to email us, so I'm gonna go over the highlights of this email, okay?
2306489	2307571	Hi all, Ranma here.
2308111	2309853	Isn't that how he also greets us on Skype?
2310374	2310895	I think so.
2311604	2313185	You're on the show too damn much, Ranma.
2313205	2313545	I don't know.
2313606	2314086	No, I'm kidding.
2314306	2314987	What's he got to say?
2315027	2315647	We love Ranma.
2315747	2316087	Oh, we do.
2316508	2324314	I truly enjoyed episode 200 and I listened to it again on my way to work last week and I just have to say that you, Jamie, are truly a voice in the female gaming.
2324914	2330658	I have had a few female gamers on my friends list, but you by far are the most vocal and outspoken of them all.
2330999	2331879	That's just because I'm a bitch.
2332560	2335822	I truly respect you for that and don't ever lose that edge of yours.
2335982	2336723	Oh, thank you.
2337853	2342616	Anywho, there are a couple things I wanted to point out from a couple past episodes just in case I missed tonight's episode.
2343097	2344137	One, price of the Wii Remote.
2344177	2345718	I don't know why people are angry over the price.
2345758	2350221	The standard Xbox 360 pad is $50, and I don't hear anyone complain about that one.
2350842	2353484	The Wii Remote is more than just a controller.
2353524	2356726	It has more features than any other next-gen controller out there, and it's less expensive.
2357290	2358711	Two, Techno DDR Heaven.
2358811	2363315	So about two weeks ago, I was with my friends at South Street Seaport, and we heard some techno music.
2363355	2366598	My friend Carmen said, Is it wrong to think of DDR when hearing techno?
2366638	2368139	I replied, It's not wrong.
2368560	2369320	It's in the groove.
2370461	2371922	No, it's not wrong unless it's in the groove.
2372022	2375686	And we laughed and got closer, and the song was Heaven from DDR Max US 1, I think.
2376126	2377507	I figured you'd all get a laugh out of that.
2377687	2378368	That is pretty funny.
2379929	2381691	Three, Enchanted Arms Gay Voice.
2382571	2383912	Yes, Rob, I totally agree with that.
2384013	2385434	I was listening to...
2386226	2391429	FF12 Day I am excited about this and I will be there as Black Mage I will take pictures for all
2415155	2416356	5.
2415375	2416356	SNK new hardware.
2416456	2418977	What SNK needs to do is make better hardware technology.
2419357	2425360	Every time they make a game on their normal equipment, in less than three weeks after it's out, the ROMs of it are totally found online.
2425480	2428202	In my honest opinion, that's a major reason why they are losing money.
2429602	2430203	Yeah, true.
2430883	2432904	Although I was one of the people that paid $390 for KOF 2000, but...
2437856	2439077	Loki's I'm Staying In.
2439618	2440979	Thank you so much for playing that.
2441379	2444662	The song reminded me of how long I've been listening to you guys.
2444742	2447165	I truly thank Raichan for telling me about you guys.
2447245	2448786	I'm surprised we didn't get more emails on that.
2450328	2451048	Thank God.
2451068	2454892	I would guess that I have been listening since episode 50 or so.
2455372	2457734	And for a dial-up station, that was really good stream.
2458415	2459436	That back in the day we were.
2460437	2461138	7.
2460457	2461138	Dance Revolution.
2461198	2463919	After seeing it again, I say that it has already gotten old.
2464039	2465139	They had eliminated two teams.
2465159	2468961	The remaining three were doing new dance routines to the same techno dance beat as the first episode.
2469541	2477065	What Dance Revolution needs is to allow teams to dance and choreograph songs from any of the DDR games and maybe, just maybe, let the Slumber Party girls cover a B4U track.
2477785	2478606	Well, that's all for now.
2478826	2480567	I'll try to call in if I can.
2480727	2481807	If not, have a great episode 201.
2481847	2485409	And by the way, wouldn't this be like the fifth season of OLR Live?
2486346	2489408	Oh, and Rob, I am used to that we can plan out SkyCon in October.
2489748	2490748	I'm still looking forward to that.
2491449	2494470	I think we kind of dropped the whole distinguishing seasons thing.
2495251	2507197	I can tell you that behind the scenes we've been trying to iron out a new website, and probably with that will come some very superficial type changes when it comes to art and logos and things of that nature.
2507597	2511259	But that won't be until probably the end of the year, going on into 2007.
2511680	2514101	But we know our website is not the best website.
2515157	2515958	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2545831	2546931	Tell XM to pick us up.
2547752	2548492	I mean, that's it for email.
2549252	2549613	Sweet.
2550673	2551633	Well, thank you, emailers.
2551774	2552374	Send us more.
2552634	2554135	Mailbag at Orangelandradio.com.
2554255	2554735	You guys rock.
2554935	2555835	And we'll let Rob read it all.
2558296	2563598	Well, there's some pretty cool stuff coming out from Tokyo Game Show from Namco Bandai.
2564239	2570081	And it's about this game that used to be called Trusty Bell, or at least it's Trusty Bell in Japan.
2570161	2573683	Now it's coming over here as Eternal Sonata, which...
2574725	2576546	It's a pretty cool looking RPG.
2576907	2580249	Isn't this the one where you're in Chopin's mind or something like that?
2580449	2580709	Yeah.
2580870	2582911	Oh god, that game looks weird, but cool.
2583471	2586013	Yeah, so we'll be seeing that probably next year at some point.
2586654	2588555	I'm kind of glad they're having the faith to port that over.
2588935	2591657	But I would like more information on Blue Dragon US port, please.
2591818	2592298	Okay, thanks.
2593078	2594059	I want a remake of Blue Dragon.
2594079	2595941	How is Blue Dragon nowhere in our show world tonight?
2597021	2599243	Okay, I want to say something about Blue Dragon then, right now.
2599622	2606807	Okay, there were lines like 90 minutes long to see Blue Dragon over at the Tokyo Game Show, which isn't a surprise.
2606887	2609829	Well, it is a surprise when you consider it's an Xbox 360 game and this is Japan.
2610970	2618756	But when you consider that, you know, remember when it was big, you know, turn heads that some of the people behind Final Fantasy had gone over to the Xbox side?
2619036	2620157	Well, this is the game.
2620637	2621678	You know, this is the big game.
2622058	2624300	And I'll tell you what, from the previews I saw, it looks pretty hot.
2624440	2625641	I can't wait to play it, so...
2626656	2627977	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2651639	2663307	Microsoft has said that they are going to waive the cost of repairs on Xbox 360 consoles that were manufactured before January 1st, 2006 and refund any fees already paid.
2665609	2673074	They were basically doing an analysis of the repair and basically it was the initial manufacturing run of the machine.
2673094	2674735	They've determined where a lot of problems are.
2675202	2677244	and they keep having them come in from that.
2677364	2680686	They said that it was a higher rate than what they are happy with.
2681207	2688873	So they've decided to comp repairs for any of the consoles manufactured before January 1st, 2006 and do those refunds.
2690834	2694317	I'd say you probably have to contact Microsoft Technical Support.
2696259	2702003	They did actually, though, say that they've rejected claims of an unusually high hardware failure rate.
2702243	2702364	So...
2703237	2711742	Well, good for Microsoft for doing the right thing with this, I think, because I think to charge somebody for these broken systems just because their 90-day warranty was up was kind of mean.
2712682	2714484	But I think the window needs to be extended a little bit.
2714644	2718346	I bought my Xbox 360 in February, and that thing broke right away.
2718686	2722828	And I would be pissed if I was right on the bubble there January, February, and mine broke.
2722868	2726090	I think it's obvious that there were still some production problems into the earlier year.
2726550	2729712	So thank you, Microsoft, for taking a step in the right direction.
2730073	2730833	Now take one more.
2731994	2733154	In my opinion, they need to.
2735215	2740596	Anyway, quick story, kind of relating to Xbox 360.
2741396	2753778	The official Xbox magazine ran a promo from Circuit City, and Circuit City was giving away this coupon that said that they were going to be offering 15% off of 99 Nights and Gears of War.
2754298	2758159	Hey, pretty cool, except for the fact that the coupon was set to expire October 31st.
2759238	2766906	So while you could get 15% off 99 nights, that thing won't do you a damn bit of good when it comes to Gears of War because Gears of War is not coming out until November.
2767447	2770090	Well, just so you know, a clarification has arrived.
2770330	2776817	And this, by the way, didn't make Circus City look good because there was that whole story a couple weeks ago about the one in San Diego that was offering to
2777216	2780397	You know, install the backwards compatibility on your Xbox for a fee.
2780477	2781917	I'm surprised it wasn't the best buy.
2781937	2783057	That was so messed up.
2783417	2786798	But anyway, so Circuit City, ooh, really having to dig themselves out a hole.
2786998	2787938	And they are.
2788598	2795640	Official Xbox Magazine sent something out that said Circuit City is aware that the coupon in the November issue is messed up.
2796240	2805702	They're going to publish another coupon in the next issue of Official Xbox Magazine that will extend the promotion through the end of November, I believe it was.
2806222	2806322	So.
2807301	2808321	That's pretty cool, Elise.
2808841	2809822	That's nice of them.
2809982	2815503	And also, speaking of nice of people to do something for us, SNK finally got their head out of their butt.
2816243	2821045	We are going to be getting a new King of Fighters with a complete visual overhaul.
2821585	2822765	New sprites.
2823545	2824125	Finally.
2824525	2828406	Because I remember sitting back and playing, like, what is it, KOF 2001.
2829047	2830107	It was the same old Kyo.
2831367	2833448	We have Kula, you know, with everything.
2833588	2834388	It's like, no.
2836224	2845030	They finally have listened to us, and there actually is speculation that it's going to be high-res sprites like in the Guilty Gear series.
2848712	2854276	We can only hope that certain other publishers of ongoing 2D fighting series listen to us.
2854756	2856478	Capcom, please.
2857919	2862522	That's kind of hot that finally King of Fighters is getting some new sprites, because...
2863736	2867138	Loki likes to bitch on every episode, and I'll admit I've done it too.
2867238	2872460	With some of these games like Metal Slug and King of Fighters, they have not changed the graphics one damn bit in the past ten years.
2872940	2874541	So someone at SNK has been listening.
2874601	2875681	You know what I would like to see?
2875861	2879923	I would like to see the KOF series get the Street Fighter 3 treatment.
2881303	2883624	With the extra animations and...
2885563	2885863	All that.
2886023	2887904	Well, that's the thing about Metal Slug, actually.
2887964	2893446	One of the things they announced this week was that the Metal Slug Anthology is going to be including Metal Slug 6 as well.
2894626	2895927	And will it have new graphics?
2898248	2899128	Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.
2901252	2902253	But it has Metal Slug 6.
2902533	2906695	I mean, that's got to be different than Metal Slug 5 or 4 or 3 or 2 or 1.
2906775	2908176	I'm not going to knock Metal Slug.
2908216	2911738	It is a good game, and getting six of them at one price is not going to be a bad deal.
2911898	2919562	But I think if they're going to make another standalone one, you might want to up the graphics to the new... Please don't hear me wrong.
2919622	2923945	A game doesn't have to have the greatest graphics in the world to be a good game.
2924345	2929828	But, you know, if the technology's there, is it that hard?
2931010	2933170	to change it and make it a little nicer looking?
2933370	2933711	I don't know.
2934031	2935311	I'm not expecting to be blown away.
2935431	2938051	I don't need Halo 3, Gears of War-style graphics.
2938111	2951014	I just want, you know... Well, I even remember back in the day when Mugen was having its big day, there were actually people going in and retouching a lot of sprites from old games and making completely new fighters with the Mugen engine.
2954134	2954474	I don't know.
2955315	2957295	I think it's kind of weird that, you know,
2958513	2959554	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2984082	2987103	because apparently they're having trouble with it.
2987403	2996825	It's only listed as about 50% complete right now at Tokyo Game Show, and it's not very good, seeing as it's supposed to be released in a few months.
2997525	2998145	Ouch.
2998805	2999525	Yeah.
2999885	3000726	So that's official.
3000786	3002086	They've delayed it until 2007.
3002386	3010208	Yeah, and this has actually been confirmed by a Sony Computer Entertainment Japan fact sheet that it's confirmed as a summer 2007 release.
3012264	3018968	So, um, you know, with that out of the way, you know, I guess there are only, there's not a lot of launch titles.
3018988	3022390	Well, at least you're getting Ridge Racer 7, which does look pretty hot.
3022450	3026493	Ridge Racer 7 is 100% complete, so yeah, you will be getting that launch.
3026933	3035298	So, and actually, that's one of the first titles that's actually being released, you know, because they usually release titles before the console launches, and that's actually one of the first ones that come out.
3036459	3037219	Good job, Namco.
3037760	3038040	Good job.
3038860	3046847	Well, you might have heard during this week some dates get announced before they were supposed to, among other things, from Ubisoft.
3047267	3059037	That's because somebody found a 2GB archive file on the FTP server that had information, video, artwork, and screens from all the upcoming roster of Ubisoft titles.
3059697	3060138	Whoops!
3061148	3075383	meaning that they discovered Far Cry Wii, Lost, Naruto, Open Season, Rainbow Six Vegas, Splinter Cell 4, Surf's Up, Shaun White Snowboarding, Star Wars Lethal Alliance on PSP, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Assassin's Creed.
3076023	3079707	There were also some previously unannounced games that were in this RAR file.
3080027	3084792	A brand new Prince of Persia, which seems to be something we've actually mentioned on this program previously,
3085248	3088853	and Splinter Cell Games and Far Cry and Rocky on the PSP.
3088913	3091816	You know, it's so funny because I thought Rocky had already been announced.
3091836	3094860	I've had actually a sell sheet for Rocky for about a couple weeks.
3096802	3097984	I didn't know there was an announce.
3098204	3099125	It's hard for me to keep track.
3099686	3099946	Oh, well.
3100607	3101628	But yeah, Rocky's coming out.
3102089	3102309	All right.
3103315	3111001	Anyway, now that was a very interesting find on the internet, and DarkSakura likes to surf the internet up and down to make interesting finds of her own.
3111461	3113082	And she'll share them with you each and every week.
3113402	3114263	I sure will!
3114423	3117045	In this segment called the Website of the Week.
3122288	3124550	And no, it's not the Arcade Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
3126559	3156131	My website of the week is actually an official website and anyone who's been reading my live journal and listening to me go into fangasms over this the website of the week is the official Doctor Who website on the BBC website because I love Doctor Who if you go to bbc.co.uk slash Doctor Who you will go to the fantastic site where there's lots of wallpaper with David Tennant all over it and Billy Piper all over it
3157111	3185116	and K9 and Sarah Jane and everybody and downloadable mobile phone stuff and it's actually better than just about any of the fan sites I've seen and there is even a link to the classic series too with a what is the TARDIS tutorial as someone who has grown up with Doctor Who as a constant squee fangasm fangirl yep, I'm proud of it
3188842	3192664	Doctor Who Doctor Who Doctor Who Doctor Who Doctor Who
3218271	3218952	and Torino.
3219172	3231243	Calling them the Xbox Killers makes them sound like they go into people's houses at night like ninjas and cut the cords from the Xbox and smash it with a hammer while everyone's sleeping and then leaves the house silently.
3231904	3236928	Well, anyways, they were sentenced to death.
3237609	3241432	So, yeah, apparently they murdered six people in 2004 and...
3245526	3246126	Yeah, now they're dead.
3246166	3247266	What exactly did they do?
3247366	3249327	They murdered them over an Xbox, or what?
3249947	3253448	Well, that's what they assumed, because I guess, you know, they stole an Xbox.
3254048	3262650	It says the murders were vicious, blood being found on the floors and ceilings and the walls, and the victims were not only bludgeoned to death, but were mutilated afterwards.
3263190	3273972	And it says, you know, basically, you know, the killer... Oh, never mind, that's another story where they're talking about that person who killed their...
3275242	3277103	Child over the Xbox thing too.
3277763	3280264	A lot of people causing violence over an Xbox.
3281705	3282005	I don't know.
3282325	3288127	I think the Wii will be so easily accessible to this kind of stuff.
3288647	3295150	Especially when you get those third party controllers or something in shape like a samurai sword or actually a samurai sword.
3295250	3296030	Oh, that'd be cool.
3297031	3297791	Samurai sword.
3298411	3300072	You can kill people.
3300412	3300832	Or hookers.
3301652	3303193	You're just waiting for that with the Wii, aren't you?
3304454	3304674	Yes.
3304874	3305155	All right.
3305475	3310138	Anyway, that's just about going to wrap it up for news tonight.

3332213	3334234	There may be something coming in the very near future.
3334721	3336422	Wouldn't that make a lot of you folks very happy?
3336963	3338104	Let's go to the phones.
3338644	3339765	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3339785	3340165	Who's this?
3340806	3341526	RavensDolphin.
3341726	3342527	Hi, RavensDolphin.
3342547	3343208	What's on your mind, buddy?
3344388	3346270	You know that Xbox serial killer?
3346530	3346810	Yeah.
3346930	3353295	It reminds me of this episode of the Boondocks when we were like, we gotta find the Xbox killer.
3353516	3354436	We have to find him.
3355197	3356658	You have to set that up for me a little bit.
3356678	3358900	You have to pardon my ignorance, but I don't watch a whole lot of TV.
3358940	3360241	So what's the show about?
3360281	3362382	Wait, is that the cartoon one that's...
3364520	3365543	Yeah, it's on Adult Swim.
3365583	3366626	I think I've seen a clip of it.
3367361	3377648	All right, the show is a suburban... These are African-Americans that is out of their unit, and they go to, like, suburban life, and see Huey and Dewey, and they go on adventures.
3377928	3385053	And this episode involved a guy going to jail because he got murdered over an Xbox, and he went like, They're gonna raid me!
3385073	3385914	They're gonna raid me!
3386134	3386975	You gotta do something!
3386995	3387815	He went like, hold on.
3388096	3391518	Was this before or after the real-life Xbox killer?
3392218	3392959	Oh, before.
3393239	3394000	Way before.
3394280	3394520	Hmm.
3394540	3395240	Interesting.
3395301	3395821	Interesting.
3396647	3401029	So is it possible that this show, maybe this person should be called the Boondocks Killer?
3402090	3404451	I think so, because that's what makes me laugh about it.
3404471	3406932	I'm like, oh God, this reminds me of that episode.
3407813	3410854	Interesting reality mirroring fiction.
3410954	3411855	Kind of sad, though.
3412475	3416037	Regardless of what inspired it, these people should have known better.
3416657	3416957	Period.
3417778	3418898	Yeah.
3418938	3419959	Anything else on your mind, my friend?
3420539	3421279	Two more things.
3421379	3421659	Okay.
3422460	3423961	I got a bone to pick with you, Sky.
3424301	3424501	What?
3425584	3430606	Last time when I talked to you about a DS Lite, you said run it over with a car and I would get a black one.
3431706	3432206	I did?
3433687	3434307	I probably did.
3435187	3437988	Yeah, you said buy the warranty and run it over with a car.
3438548	3440029	Oh, wait, I don't think I said that.
3440049	3442510	I think Miklatov said it.
3443150	3443710	Maybe I did.
3443810	3444130	I don't know.
3444370	3444610	Fine.
3444671	3448752	Whoever who said it, I still had to pay 50 bucks for the black one.
3449672	3451913	Did you seriously go and run over it with a car?
3453343	3455345	No, thank God it had a hairline fracture.
3455825	3456106	Oh, okay.
3456486	3459789	I was like, oh my God, please don't tell me you actually went and ran over with a car.
3460970	3461730	No, I would be sad.
3461750	3463392	I'd like to see someone who did that.
3463852	3466454	You know, Walmart's return policy might let you do that.
3467635	3470238	Oh, Walmart, you can return anything at Walmart.
3470298	3471399	It doesn't matter if it's there.
3472039	3474441	Somebody in chat had brought that up earlier, so it just made me think of that.
3474461	3478144	The whole Walmart return policy is so liberal.
3479486	3479826	Okay.
3480326	3480967	What's the other thing?
3482386	3484548	Do you hold Christmas to a high regard?
3484588	3489932	Because when I listen to Orange Lounge Radio for a year, it feels like Christmas is nothing, just another day.
3491873	3493434	I hold Boxing Day in high regard.
3494775	3500319	You know, I'll tell you what, in my personal family life, we don't have the whole big deal Christmas thing.
3500359	3503201	We will do something on Christmas morning, but that's about it.
3503341	3505282	And there's no children really in the family.
3505302	3508905	We're kind of a small family unit, so it's not the big deal it is for some families.
3510209	3514390	DarkSakura, are you going to require an Elvira Pinball game?
3514410	3517231	Because I love that game on the Atari Lynx.
3517491	3518332	Yes, I own that.
3519112	3520432	Elvira Pinball.
3520592	3521493	That would be hot.
3521553	3522313	You need to do that.
3522553	3525354	Make that happen.
3525794	3528575	I've seen an Elvira Pinball recently because I know some people who own one.
3528915	3531316	Isn't that the one that had the lower playing field?
3532999	3534220	It's been so long, Dark.
3534280	3534820	I'm sorry.
3535120	3537221	I do believe, because I've seen one.
3537421	3538522	I did see an Elvira pinball.
3538562	3544985	The place that we got our last action hero from, I think, had an Elvira pinball in their little repair place.
3545125	3548727	The last time I saw an Elvira machine was in Chico, where I went to school.
3550268	3556651	Actually, next on our list is actually a Doctor Who pinball machine for me and a Medieval Madness.
3557364	3559226	What about... I know this is so random.
3559266	3561348	What about an Austin Power one?
3561388	3563590	That one holds fond memories with me, too.
3563830	3564731	It's a fun one.
3565071	3565751	One I wouldn't mind.
3565972	3570215	Although, I actually found... Dan found a place in town that has a Pirates of the Caribbean machine.
3570336	3571877	One of the new Stern machines.
3572457	3573398	I want to play that.
3573458	3574819	It's $4,000, though.
3575740	3576501	I don't have that.
3576581	3576781	Yeah.
3578345	3579546	Yeah, you can only get them new.
3579966	3591493	Although, from what I understand, the licensing to put out some of the prototype machines that Capcom had out, like Big Bang Bar, from what I understand, I think Stern acquired the licensing to release those now.
3591553	3592814	I'll have to find that out for sure.
3593735	3594335	Yeah, would you?
3595636	3596096	Definitely.
3596116	3598017	As soon as I find that out, I'll make it public knowledge.
3598958	3599218	All right.
3599398	3600138	Oh, Let's Party.
3600359	3601379	That was a great staple.
3602420	3602740	All right.
3602780	3605982	As much as I'd love to reminisce about pinball all night, we've got other calls we've got to get to.
3607163	3607423	All right.
3608410	3608990	Raven's Dolphin.
3610551	3610871	That's it.
3611031	3611271	All right.
3611311	3611791	Have a good night.
3612351	3612651	You too.
3612691	3612831	Bye.
3612871	3613151	See ya.
3613551	3614632	All right.
3614652	3615512	Let's go to another call.
3616212	3617293	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3617333	3617693	Who's this?
3618413	3619313	Hey, this is Anoush.
3619553	3620073	Hi, Anoush.
3620093	3620713	What's on your mind?
3621514	3629016	Hey, I was just wondering if you guys heard about that software update that Microsoft's going to release for the 360 that's going to
3629989	3630369	Output 1080p
3652463	3654844	Well, aren't they going to upscale movies or something?
3654864	3658086	Movies and stuff will be upscaled, and games will be upscaled to 1080p.
3658387	3660928	You can do 1080p with a VGA cable.
3661388	3667852	But now Sony's come back and kind of poo-pooing that statement going, oh, but it's not native 1080, they're just upscaling things.
3668092	3673736	Yeah, but if games are programmed to 1080p, they will play it natively at 1080p.
3673976	3674396	Interesting.
3675176	3678438	Yeah, they're saying, oh, they're not natively 1080p.
3678478	3681020	Well, yeah, neither are some of your games, so shut the hell up.
3681883	3685665	Anush, I'll ask you, what do you think about the news?
3686225	3692428	It doesn't really make sense to me, because wouldn't they put some kind of digital output on it, like HDMI?
3693588	3697230	Well, technically, can't components handle 1080p?
3697310	3699971	It's just not as... I mean, I don't know enough about video specs.
3700031	3702812	They don't need HDMI to do 1080p.
3703273	3706234	It's just, HDMI is going to be required when they digitally sign...
3707426	3711989	when the broadcast flag goes into effect in a few years.
3712029	3714551	Why do I need HDMI over component?
3714611	3717653	Is it just that much clearer of a picture like component over S-video?
3717833	3719054	I believe so.
3719114	3721235	And also, I'm not sure.
3721255	3724417	I can't remember if component can do 1080p.
3724457	3725058	I think it can.
3725158	3726538	I need to read up on Wikipedia.
3726799	3735284	But I know HDMI, though, the big thing, and I think this is kind of one of the reasons why they added it to the lower-end PS3 model, too, is so that they can
3735908	3744270	Support the broadcast flag for the movies and stuff, because otherwise, in 2009 or whenever this broadcast flag goes into effect...
3745407	3751009	All your movies are going to be dropped down to 540p and that's the highest they will go if you're watching Blu-ray.
3751349	3753369	Jeremy Todd 1 has an interesting comment in chat.
3753849	3757030	I'm sick of all this 1080p versus 1080i bullshit.
3757050	3759611	95% of people won't even be able to tell the difference between the two.
3759691	3761252	This is just an e-penis sort of thing.
3761332	3761572	It is.
3761972	3768233	Basically, you're not going to notice the difference unless you have a TV that's over like 48 inches and you're sitting 6 feet away.
3771634	3773515	Anoush, do you own any next-gen systems yet?
3774542	3775924	Are you planning on purchasing any of them?
3776824	3779107	Yeah, I think I might go for a Wii and a PS3.
3779367	3786553	A Wii and a PS3, so this doesn't sway you, being somebody who wants to get a PS3, this doesn't sway you in Xbox's direction any?
3787974	3789936	I kind of swore not to get an Xbox.
3790196	3790977	Ooh, why's this?
3792779	3794020	Totally against Microsoft.
3794984	3795785	Okay, okay.
3795825	3811017	Well, I know a lot of people who are in that camp, they just really don't want to... You know, I used to be in that camp too, but I gotta say, there were just... Some of the games towards the end of the first Xbox run really finally convinced me that I needed to check it out, and I've been pretty happy with it.
3811618	3812278	You know what I say.
3812298	3815841	The system is only as good as the games that are on it.
3816201	3820065	Let me guess, Anoush, are you a role-playing type fan?
3820085	3822847	Like, those are your types of games, the games that Microsoft kind of lacks on?
3823873	3824673	Not really.
3824953	3828214	I'm more into racing games and FPS.
3828514	3828915	Interesting.
3829275	3833816	And you still don't like Xbox 360 because that's pretty much all they have right now.
3834216	3835156	That's true.
3835396	3836096	Okay, interesting.
3836377	3838657	Well, I mean, you're free to like what you like.
3838717	3839417	There's no problem.
3839798	3844899	But I was just kind of curious on your thoughts on how 1080p might sway your thoughts on that one way or the other.
3845979	3848560	It wasn't really the 1080p that makes me want the PS3.
3848760	3850340	It's more of a fanboy thing.
3851061	3852041	Okay, okay, so...
3852790	3853430	Well, that's funny.
3853650	3855171	What games are you looking forward to on PS3?
3856932	3858172	Gran Turismo HD.
3859212	3862834	From what you guys said, I'm kind of swaying against that now.
3862854	3866895	Yeah, I was going to say, what does this whole microtransactions thing do to your opinion on that?
3870397	3874959	I'm kind of thinking that maybe Sony will give you a points card with the game.
3875279	3875759	I hope so.
3876779	3878640	And you can download whatever you like.
3879201	3880401	Like so many points.
3880982	3881442	We'll see.
3881742	3886043	You know what's funny is that a lot of people are talking about Wii 60 was this big thing.
3886063	3887143	People were going to get the Wii 60.
3887484	3888204	And now I missed it.
3888224	3890324	Gohan in chat is saying it should be Wii S3.
3891185	3892525	So you're in the Wii S3 camp.
3893485	3894266	Yeah, I guess so.
3894466	3894806	All right.
3894906	3895326	Sounds good.
3895346	3897327	Go register WiiS3.com before someone else does.
3898427	3898647	Okay.
3898767	3899307	All right, Anush.
3899367	3899727	Take care.
3900387	3900888	Yeah, you too.
3901028	3901408	Bye-bye.
3901928	3903228	Thanks.
3903268	3904349	Let's go to another call.
3904449	3905429	Let's go to this call.
3906135	3907576	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
3907596	3908797	Holy crap, you scared the crap out of me, it's DMN.
3908817	3908877	Boo!
3908897	3909037	Hi, DMN!
3909057	3909097	Ah!
3909117	3909817	What's on your mind?
3910018	3912599	Um, actually something you guys haven't talked about today.
3912619	3913300	His skull is on his mind.
3935239	3945525	The totally unprofessional comments about Sony calling the Xbox 360's HD DVD drive quote-unquote unfortunate.
3947086	3960233	I don't have the link to the article handy, but basically Sony said your HD DVD drive sucks and we're better in a very unprofessional sort of way, yet very businesslike.
3960853	3963334	Everybody's just waving their cocks around, I mean...
3967401	3973745	The marketplace will choose the ultimate victor and then I believe bragging rights can be bestowed.
3973785	3977968	But yeah, it's just they're talking trash because they're trying to talk their own thing up because it's coming out soon.
3979068	3979549	But I don't know.
3979909	3981710	I'm going to be perfectly honest with you.
3982550	3991556	My friend and I went into a Best Buy this week and finally, after all this time, I got to see an HD DVD and a Blu-ray side by side.
3992156	3992897	And I'll tell you what.
3993619	3995961	I have to say I think the Blu-ray did look a little better.
3996422	4012596	But there are some other factors to take into consideration here because, you know, my friend who is with me, David, said, you know, the other TV is kind of crappy and plus they're playing Ultraviolet on the Blu-ray, which is, you know, a movie as crappy as the movie is, I'm sure, is meant to look very stylish and cool.
4012877	4018402	Whereas over here you're getting like the Manchurian Candidate or something that's not really, you know, action-packed.
4018842	4019903	So I don't know.
4020606	4026469	But my first impression did tell me that, you know what, Blu-ray was a little prettier.
4026529	4028390	Blu-ray is a little prettier, but a little pricier.
4028450	4034873	Like, HD DVD players, I think, run at the cheapest around $500, whereas Blu-rays are like $1,000.
4034993	4037694	This is beta versus VHS all over again.
4038034	4038575	All over again.
4039135	4045978	You know, I read somewhere, and I think we had to cut it from our show roll, but Loki, maybe you'd remember this, because I think you were the one that posted it in our super secret thread.
4046759	4047519	Something about...
4048444	4051845	Some company was going to be making discs that did both HD, DVD, and Blu-ray.
4052065	4053165	It's Warner.
4053265	4056206	They patented technology, I guess.
4056326	4059127	It's DVD, Blu-ray, and HD all in one.
4060067	4060447	Smart.
4061888	4063968	And I imagine they're going to use it for their movies.
4064248	4064568	Smart.
4065668	4069409	So no matter what format it goes, they're supporting it.
4069870	4071510	I think that's a great idea.
4071530	4071610	Yeah.
4072191	4075013	I wish this whole format war thing would end and just come up with something.
4075033	4075533	We'll see what happens.
4075553	4076934	Anything else you want to say, DMN?
4076954	4079296	You're cutting out there, my friend.
4079656	4080096	There you go.
4080136	4081357	Sorry, I was rubbing my face.
4103190	4106473	I just posted a link in the chatroom if anybody wants to take a look at that.
4106794	4107334	What is it?
4108936	4110237	Gamespot.something.
4110537	4110918	I don't care.
4111618	4113981	Well, I know, but what is it that I'm going to look at if I pull this up?
4115142	4118325	It's the article regarding Sony talking their shit.
4120107	4121729	Well, this is close to launch.
4121789	4122850	Who wouldn't want to whip it out?
4126530	4130996	Dave Karacker, Senior Director of Corporate Communications for Sony Computer Entertainment America
4138374	4144538	Sony realizes that to truly take gaming into the next generation requires a larger data format for both games and movies.
4144878	4155386	PS3 uses the Blu-ray format for gaming, giving developers 50GB of high-definition storage on a single disc, while Microsoft's 9GB DVD gaming format is an obstacle for storing HD content.
4155886	4157547	Sounds like typical cock-waving to me.
4157587	4160429	I mean, it's not like he said, God, the 360's a piece of shit.
4162472	4162752	True.
4162892	4164554	This is more the point and laugh tactic.
4164754	4171459	Yeah, this is just more trying to emphasize what's good about theirs and how it outshines the other one.
4173561	4173761	Yeah.
4174302	4175863	Well, that was about it.
4176143	4176864	You guys have a good night.
4177024	4177805	All right, you too, buddy.
4177825	4178545	Thanks for the topic.
4179126	4179746	All right, bye-bye.
4179786	4180006	Bye.
4180427	4183409	Wow, callers are calling in with lots of good things we should have been thinking about earlier.
4183750	4185071	Let's do one more call.
4185111	4188193	I know some other folks are trying to get through, but we've got to wrap it up here pretty soon.
4189034	4189995	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio.
4190015	4190315	Who's this?
4191723	4193584	Hi, you're a little bit quiet.
4193624	4196025	Try to get a little closer to your mic if you can and tell us what's on your mind.
4196525	4197965	Yeah, my mic's a little quiet.
4199986	4201887	What's on your mind?
4201907	4202207	24, the game.
4203307	4204248	Oh, 24, the game.
4204288	4204688	What about it?
4206068	4206628	It's pretty good.
4208209	4209730	Is this something you just picked up this week?
4210750	4212410	No, I won it.
4213131	4213951	Oh, that's right.
4214431	4216552	Okay, well, it's a pretty good game?
4217884	4220445	The game's okay, but the cutscenes are pretty good.
4220905	4221165	Yeah?
4221325	4222785	How is it if you're a fan of the show?
4224145	4226246	Oh, if you're a fan of the show, you definitely gotta try it.
4226866	4228586	Yeah?
4229066	4230647	What kind of game is it?
4230687	4234307	For those that don't know what to expect out of 24, the game, what kind of game could you compare it to?
4236048	4237228	It's a third-person shooter.
4237368	4240149	There's a few mini-games in it, and there's some really crappy driving in it.
4241289	4242429	Really crappy driving in it?
4243129	4246950	Yeah, it's the worst driving I've ever played, but the rest of it's pretty good.
4247392	4248313	All right, awesome.
4248413	4251954	Well, I'm glad you've had a chance to check that out.
4252034	4255496	You're a little bit quiet, so I've got to keep this short, but is there anything else you want to share with our listeners?
4258138	4258558	Not really.
4258578	4260379	All right, well, have a good one and enjoy the game.
4261199	4261799	Yeah, see you.
4261879	4262220	Bye-bye.
4263660	4265801	Little mini game review there on the Skype line.
4265822	4266502	That's what it's for.
4266542	4269163	You guys can call in and tell us your thoughts on things.
4269543	4270164	We appreciate it.
4270204	4271785	Sorry to those folks that didn't get through tonight.
4272405	4273565	I'll have to try again next week.
4273605	4274166	What can I say?
4274786	4276367	Any other last-minute stories here in studio?
4278403	4279524	In other news, I'm still awesome.
4282627	4284829	Was anyone ever questioning that, DarkSakura?
4285050	4288152	No, I just have to keep, you know, making a mention.
4289354	4291075	But if you disagree, send us an email.
4291696	4293017	If you disagree, keep it to yourself.
4294418	4294699	All right.
4295920	4297281	Anything from you, Loki?
4297301	4297381	Okay.
4297790	4298250	I'm trying to think.
4298350	4299912	I know there was some other stuff I had.
4300192	4304014	I'm looking real quick here because I shut down my list because I suck.
4305135	4307117	I'm trying to think here.
4310419	4311220	Let's see.
4311540	4312180	Great radio.
4313381	4315943	Yeah, I think we might have to wrap it up if you don't have anything.
4316003	4316763	Okay, here we go.
4318445	4319425	Well, a couple of small things.
4319906	4322287	There was a couple of stories.
4322508	4325890	First off, no PlayStation 2 version of Grand Theft Auto Vice City stories coming out.
4327054	4327534	None at all?
4327794	4328215	None at all.
4328315	4328575	Really?
4356236	4379280	which is interesting and then what was the other one I was going to say oh yeah they're working on a new Metal Gear Solid digital comic based on Metal Gear Solid 2 in Japan so that would be pretty cool and what was the other one oh Square's working on Front Mission for the DS so that should be pretty neat hmm
4379665	4381606	I have some news actually for our UK listeners.
4381726	4382626	What's up?
4382706	4392770	Anyone who is looking for Football Manager 2007, there's a demo being released on Sunday, 1st October for PC, Mac, and Intel Mac.
4395532	4403215	To quote on here, the vanilla version will include English and Scottish quick starts, English language only, with limited assets, logo and player pictures, etc.,
4404275	4410260	This will be available from the News of the World website in conjunction with Play.com to try and maximize the bandwidth available.
4410320	4417565	The link to this will, of course, be on SIGames.com when it's released at midnight.
4418366	4425711	The Strawberry version, that's kind of funny, will include extra quick starts and extra languages to be confirmed with more assets.
4425731	4427973	This will be available initially as a torrent only.
4428413	4431735	Also at midnight from www.SIGames.com.
4432536	4433757	So, if anyone's interested in that.
4434893	4441679	Speaking of London or the UK listeners, there's actually going to be a London's Game Festival kicking off on October 2nd.
4442459	4443900	It runs through the 7th.
4443920	4447203	You're going to be able to play tons of games.
4447263	4448604	That's a long festival, five days.
4448965	4454989	Yeah, you're going to be able to play tons of games at a special setup at Oxford Street's HMV.
4455210	4460734	Plus there's going to be various other events and venues and showcases going on around the same time.
4461512	4466595	Some other fun things to note, at Tokyo Game Show they were showing off some different colored PSPs.
4468175	4473618	One including a camo, as well as red, yellow, and green PSPs.
4474799	4477040	Or, I'm sorry, red, blue, and yellow PSPs.
4477800	4479761	All with metallic sheens to them.
4480541	4486584	And another fun one I thought of, Devil May Cry is being made into an anime.
4488065	4488825	Should be interesting.
4489506	4490386	That should be pretty cool.
4491693	4498137	Alright, well, it's about time we wrap up this program for tonight and wait till next week for more gaming news.
4498717	4501239	Let's go around, though, first and get everyone's final thought.
4501940	4504261	Drew Nami, thanks again for being here as always.
4504721	4505462	What's your final thought?
4505982	4506422	Food.
4507103	4507423	Alright.
4508023	4508864	Loki, your final thought?
4509464	4514828	My final thought is, and I forgot to mention, Unreal Tournament 2007 for the PlayStation 3 will support mods.
4516449	4516729	Hot.
4517409	4518450	DarkSakura, your final thought?
4519008	4519469	Food.
4519769	4521751	I've eaten nothing but bagels today.
4522712	4524814	My final thought is cookies.
4525194	4525775	I did cookies.
4525815	4526576	I brought cookies.
4527537	4527797	All right.
