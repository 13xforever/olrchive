00:14.000 --> 00:26.000
Tonight, September 3rd, 2006, Loki brings us new exclusives from the inside, PlayStation 3 gets a new slogan, and an old computer classic makes its way to the Nintendo DS.

00:26.000 --> 00:37.520
Hello everybody and welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio. We are that video

00:37.520 --> 00:43.200
game independent podcast dedicated to what gamers really want to know. Video game news,

00:43.200 --> 00:47.960

00:47.960 --> 00:51.280
that. My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Sky and also here to help us out. Say

00:51.280 --> 00:53.600
Say hello to Loki, Techmaster.

00:53.600 --> 00:54.600
Hello.

00:54.600 --> 00:55.600
How you doing?

00:55.600 --> 00:56.600
I'm okay.

00:56.600 --> 00:57.600
All right, good.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.580
Dark Sakura is not here tonight.

00:59.580 --> 01:02.420
She is celebrating her anniversary this weekend.

01:02.420 --> 01:07.480
They got married on September 1st, so a big congratulations and happy first wedding anniversary

01:07.480 --> 01:11.400
wishes to Dark Sakura and Dan the man, her husband.

01:11.400 --> 01:15.000
Filling in tonight, say hello to an old Orange Lounge Radio favorite, Miklotov.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Hello.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
How you doing?

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
I'm fine.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.280
All right, sounds good.

01:19.280 --> 01:24.600
Well let's not waste a moment here let's get right into how is your gaming week and we're

01:24.600 --> 01:27.480
going to start it off with Loki tonight to tell us about his gaming week when the games

01:27.480 --> 01:32.520
he's been playing and what he likes what he hates I've been playing well lots of Saints

01:32.520 --> 01:37.240
Row because that game is awesome I tried a little bit of the online and I think it's

01:37.240 --> 01:43.680
I don't know the games that I played were very laggy to the point where they're pretty

01:43.680 --> 01:48.440
much unplayable it's gonna be fun though when they get whatever that you know what's wrong

01:48.440 --> 01:53.920
if it worked out. But in the meantime, I don't know, it's okay. I did discover that there

01:53.920 --> 01:57.520
are cheat codes in the game. Granted, cheat codes you can't get achievements for, but

01:57.520 --> 02:03.280
it's fun during lunch hours, you know, and having infinite rockets. So I've been keeping

02:03.280 --> 02:08.160
myself very occupied with that and it's pretty cool driving around like in a big ring and

02:08.160 --> 02:16.440
stuff and killing cops and people and just general mayhem. And then other than that,

02:16.440 --> 02:22.660
I did try a little bit more of Rumble Rose's XX, and I really don't like that game, but

02:22.660 --> 02:27.680
I have dedicated myself to decide to finish and play it before I saw it back, because

02:27.680 --> 02:31.920
you know, there's unachieved achievement points there that I have to get.

02:31.920 --> 02:36.440
Yeah, except they're kind of hard to get in that game, because that game's not very forgiving.

02:36.440 --> 02:37.440
It's tough.

02:37.440 --> 02:38.440
Yeah, it's pretty tough.

02:38.440 --> 02:41.880
Well, like I tried to finish, I played more Blazing Angels this week, I tried to finish,

02:41.880 --> 02:43.500
you know, the arcade mode.

02:43.500 --> 02:45.480
It's just too damn boring.

02:45.480 --> 02:50.280
I mean, granted you can beat the game by using the cheat codes, you can play through the

02:50.280 --> 02:54.860
game and have god mode and heavy damaging weapons.

02:54.860 --> 03:00.580
But it takes like 6 hours to go through the arcade mode because you have to fight 3 waves

03:00.580 --> 03:01.580
of 12 planes.

03:01.580 --> 03:06.200
And you have to do that for each plane that's in your collection, which there's 32 of them.

03:06.200 --> 03:08.640
And it takes a very long time.

03:08.640 --> 03:11.840
It's not that it's impossible, it's just so fucking boring.

03:11.840 --> 03:14.640
Be honest, I don't know why they put that even in there.

03:14.640 --> 03:18.720
arcade mode is almost the same as this like mini campaign mode that they have

03:19.440 --> 03:25.760
it's just dumb it's a really really dumb game i'm sorry but it is and i do not recommend it for the

03:25.760 --> 03:31.520
playstation 3 or the wii when it comes out no matter how you know how anxious you might be

03:31.520 --> 03:39.280
but the tooth control oh great it'll be hard to control and boring no it really is but the wii nunchucks

03:39.280 --> 03:43.680
It really is a boring game. I mean, I've played through the whole campaign

03:43.680 --> 03:49.680
I finally got s rankings on everything and it is boring almost all the campaigns are exactly the same

03:49.680 --> 03:51.360
There were a couple that were pretty cool

03:51.360 --> 03:54.320
There was some that you're in a flying fortress and actually working, you know

03:54.320 --> 03:59.680
The rotating guns on there that was a cool mission and I wish there was more of it in the game

03:59.680 --> 04:05.760
But there's not there's only that one level and that's it. So oh well, but it's a crappy game now

04:05.760 --> 04:11.760
I have to introduce our always present fourth guest and that is the chat room and if you're listening live on this Sunday night head

04:11.760 --> 04:15.300
on over to www.orange lounge radio.com and click on chat and

04:15.760 --> 04:21.520
Let's see. It was Jeremy Todd one in chat said wait. He was complaining about it being boring if it's boring

04:21.520 --> 04:23.840
Why would you do god mode it would make it even more boring?

04:24.760 --> 04:28.460
Why because I want to get the game over as quick as possible because it is so boring

04:28.800 --> 04:30.800
You know basically the whole game

04:30.800 --> 04:34.220
requires you to chase after these planes and you have to end up looping around

04:34.220 --> 04:37.940
shooting them looping around shooting them again imagine that for like oh

04:37.940 --> 04:41.540
trust me the missions are long enough as it is I do not want to make them any

04:41.540 --> 04:46.700
longer so I'm almost done the game I this is my last achievement I just need

04:46.700 --> 04:51.980
to get done then I'll be done with this game I can sell it back and then play

04:51.980 --> 04:55.660
more Ridge Racer and I loved you know it's it's a fun game and I really wish

04:55.660 --> 05:00.580
there Ridge Racer 7 was coming out on the 360 but it's not and you know sadly

05:00.580 --> 05:06.300
Sadly enough, I saw the screenshots for Ridge Racer 7 and it makes me want to get a PS3.

05:06.300 --> 05:09.300
Fuck you Ridge Racer.

05:09.300 --> 05:11.580
No wonder there's a lot of Ridge Racer love from Sony.

05:11.580 --> 05:13.360
It could sell some systems there.

05:13.360 --> 05:18.340
So think about that next time you tell some Ridge Racer jokes, it really does sell systems.

05:18.340 --> 05:22.620
It's really sad because seeing some of these screenshots of, not necessarily the first

05:22.620 --> 05:28.700
party stuff that they showed at E3, but Ridge Racer 7 and fighting at round 3, it actually

05:28.700 --> 05:32.820
looks pretty good I mean I don't know I'd have to see it in you know actually

05:32.820 --> 05:39.060
being played but uh we'll see so that's pretty much oh and of course as usual

05:39.060 --> 05:42.820
the Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories we've been playing we actually

05:42.820 --> 05:46.100
did some races and they actually have a racing and stuff and that's pretty fun

05:46.100 --> 05:48.420
which I should point out you always have something new to complain about that

05:48.420 --> 05:52.740
game yet you can't stop playing it I can't help it I'm addicted all right and

05:52.740 --> 05:56.740
we will be we'll be playing Grand Theft Auto Vice City stories despite the fact

05:56.740 --> 05:59.860
that we know that they probably changed nothing in the multiplayer and if anything it probably

05:59.860 --> 06:04.500
got worse. Alright. Miklotov, how was your gaming week?

06:04.500 --> 06:08.940
What kind of games have you been playing? I actually picked up two games this week.

06:08.940 --> 06:16.940
Enchanted Arms and Star Fox DS. And I've played Star Fox DS one time since I've had it and

06:16.940 --> 06:22.260
it was only for multiplayer which kinda sucks. Really? I would have thought that it would

06:22.260 --> 06:26.460
have been like the reason why that game sells as well as it's doing is

06:26.460 --> 06:31.500
because of multiplayer. If it weren't really boring I'm sure it would be a

06:31.500 --> 06:36.740
really good multiplayer game but it kind of sucks a lot and maybe if you had more

06:36.740 --> 06:41.420
than three people like we had playing you can play up to six um that can make

06:41.420 --> 06:47.620
it fun but enchanted arms is really cool and I enjoy playing that and I've been

06:47.620 --> 06:50.380
playing Final Fantasy, leveling Blue Mage.

06:50.380 --> 06:52.100
In Final Fantasy XI, specifically?

06:52.100 --> 06:55.780
Yes, like there are any other ones. The rest of them are stupid.

06:55.780 --> 06:59.100
Well, there's a new one called Final Fantasy XII that a lot of people are really excited

06:59.100 --> 07:00.100
about that is out there.

07:00.100 --> 07:03.300
You know what? I don't care. That's not a real Final Fantasy game.

07:03.300 --> 07:09.300
Well, technically, yes it is actually a real Final Fantasy game.

07:09.300 --> 07:10.620
Not in my world!

07:10.620 --> 07:14.100
Some would complain that it's actually more of a Final Fantasy game than XI was.

07:14.100 --> 07:19.900
There's chocobos and red mages and blue mages and black mages and white mages and whatever

07:19.900 --> 07:22.100
else and it's way more fun.

07:22.100 --> 07:25.540
And red hearts and green clovers and purple horseshoes.

07:25.540 --> 07:26.540
And blue moons.

07:26.540 --> 07:27.540
They're cool.

07:27.540 --> 07:28.540
They taste good.

07:28.540 --> 07:29.540
Lucky charms.

07:29.540 --> 07:33.500
I want some lucky charms now.

07:33.500 --> 07:34.500
That's it.

07:34.500 --> 07:36.280
I don't do anything else besides work.

07:36.280 --> 07:38.180
Anything exciting that you've been playing at work lately?

07:38.180 --> 07:43.780
For those that are new to the program, Miklotov happens to work for Konami, but he comes

07:43.780 --> 07:47.440
You'd be surprised he comes on this show not as a employee though

07:47.440 --> 07:51.680
But as a gamer and a longtime friend of the show, we've known him since before he was working there. So yeah

07:53.060 --> 07:59.580
I'm just kidding. Obviously you can't talk about what you're playing. Yeah, not really. Oh, I can tell you I'm playing at work enchanted

08:02.780 --> 08:08.060
Wait a minute that was by Ubisoft. Well, I heard the cutest. It's on my TV a lot

08:08.060 --> 08:09.540
So I guess I'm playing it

08:09.540 --> 08:14.260
I heard a really funny name for them newbie soft was what I heard. Somebody called him this week

08:14.260 --> 08:18.420
And I thought that was really funny for some reason. This is why I don't know made me laugh. I like

08:19.460 --> 08:21.800
You too. Well, as ever didn't they do one

08:22.820 --> 08:29.300
That DDR urban game flows here. Yeah flow is kind of cool. I played it. It wasn't that bad

08:29.300 --> 08:33.600
It was not a great game, but it's way better than like I don't know in the groove

08:34.620 --> 08:38.420
Except for a couple songs Sephiroth 1215. What do you think of this comment in our chat room?

08:38.420 --> 08:40.420
I ignored it, is what I thought about it.

08:40.420 --> 08:45.420
No, I have to read it here, Final Fantasy XI should have been called Final Fantasy Online and not by a number.

08:45.420 --> 08:48.420
I actually said that when the game first came out.

08:48.420 --> 08:50.420
As much as I love Final Fantasy XI, I actually agree.

08:50.420 --> 08:54.420
Yeah, probably, but you know what, it's got a number after it, so...

08:54.420 --> 08:55.420
I'll tell you what though.

08:55.420 --> 08:56.420
I'll just have to cope.

08:56.420 --> 09:00.420
When you play XII, XI fits into the series more.

09:00.420 --> 09:04.420
Because the battle system in XII feels like XI merged with the old ones.

09:04.420 --> 09:06.420
It's hard to explain, you just have to play it.

09:06.420 --> 09:09.540
Pick up Dragon Quest VIII and play the demo. I mean, seriously, Dragon Quest VIII is like

09:09.540 --> 09:10.420
twenty bucks now?

09:10.420 --> 09:14.120
Seriously, if you are a role-playing fan at any

09:14.120 --> 09:17.820
level, I mean, if you hate role-playing games, Dragon Quest VIII is gonna change your mind,

09:17.820 --> 09:19.780
but if you like role-playing games of any notion,

09:19.780 --> 09:21.940
you gotta play Dragon Quest VIII. You must.

09:21.940 --> 09:24.860
In response to Jeremy Todd's

09:24.860 --> 09:28.740
comment about how it's ironic that a couple weeks ago I said I wasn't a gamer,

09:28.740 --> 09:32.420
I'm still not. I'm just, you know, I've got a bad addiction,

09:32.420 --> 09:34.020
and so,

09:34.020 --> 09:35.620
you know, I need help.

09:35.620 --> 09:38.380
And that's it Jeremy tell one in chat is also point boy

09:38.380 --> 09:40.560
You'd think he's the only one in chat with how much we're quoting him tonight

09:40.640 --> 09:45.260
He's saying that Ubisoft is also making Assassin's Creed which was some news this week because you know

09:45.260 --> 09:51.100
It's coming out to the 360 shock and awe we all knew that well that that was like totally unexpected

09:51.100 --> 09:53.100
Yeah, but it never came out of nowhere. Yeah

09:54.160 --> 09:56.160
Let's see my gaming week, okay

09:56.380 --> 09:58.960
I'm kind of glad dark soccer is not here tonight

09:58.960 --> 10:03.780
And it's just Loki because I can take on Loki but dark soccer will make me feel like poop if she was here I

10:03.780 --> 10:08.720
I rejoined Final Fantasy 11, and I realize what I said on last week's show, but

10:08.720 --> 10:14.040
you don't understand the convincing power that Miklotov has over people.

10:14.040 --> 10:16.920
I am an enabler. I'm really, really good at that stuff.

10:16.920 --> 10:20.800
Can you help me understand it? What is so freaking great about Final Fantasy 11?

10:20.800 --> 10:22.320
Why should more people be playing it?

10:22.320 --> 10:25.680
Um, did you not see my cute little chocobo?

10:25.680 --> 10:30.720
He's so awesome! Because it's cute? Yeah, it's cute, and um...

10:30.720 --> 10:36.760
This is why you guys buy max too. I think I think one of our link shell buddies today put it best though

10:36.760 --> 10:43.440
He said something about he we were all looking at the total time spent in the game and you know jazz. He's up to

10:44.280 --> 10:45.640
198 days

10:45.640 --> 10:46.960
Yeah, he's crazy

10:46.960 --> 10:53.160
He says probably a quarter of that has been spent looking for party and that is the downside to Final Fantasy 11 big time

10:53.160 --> 10:58.120
You have to have a good link shell so that you have a chat room. Yeah, keep you busy

10:58.120 --> 11:02.020
I mean honestly I missed a lot of the people in the chat room on

11:02.440 --> 11:04.960
Chat room the link shell on Final Fantasy 11

11:04.960 --> 11:10.520
so I mean that's a good reason to come back and the fact that I was playing again is a good reason to come back and

11:10.960 --> 11:15.280
You know that doing all that crap last night to get you those quests was really fun, too

11:15.280 --> 11:19.400
Yeah, we did all the new job quests. I got blue mage Corsair and puppeteer all in one night

11:19.400 --> 11:24.620
It was actually kind of fun. I will say this about the game though. They up the graphics on Xbox 360 like they up the resolution

11:24.620 --> 11:28.780
it's a slight change you may not even notice it but I did and I think it did

11:28.780 --> 11:32.380
make the game look a little better still kind of hard to read the text still

11:32.380 --> 11:36.660
takes forever to get logged into the game but you know for the most part I'm

11:36.660 --> 11:39.820
having a good time it is because of the other people to play it and if you are

11:39.820 --> 11:43.140
playing it I would not be back and doings fun isn't it what we've been

11:43.140 --> 11:46.220
doing yeah it's fun it's quick I like playing Corsair because I get to gamble

11:46.220 --> 11:50.900
all day and I get my hit things with blue stuff now for all okay all the

11:50.900 --> 11:54.820
chat room is coming to Jamie's defense and calling me addict and yelling at me

11:54.820 --> 11:58.000
calling me a traitor and everything, look

11:58.000 --> 12:01.800
A. I will still be going to Phantasy Star Universe when that comes out so

12:01.800 --> 12:05.960
Final Fantasy XI can kiss my butt while I go play Phantasy Star Universe for a while

12:05.960 --> 12:11.040
B. Did you hear me complain the forty times she went back to Ragnarok online?

12:11.040 --> 12:15.000
Don't think so. She quit and went back to WoW as well so you know what we all have

12:15.000 --> 12:16.560
our things

12:16.560 --> 12:21.040
So, suck it. I don't care what you people think. I will game however I want.

12:21.040 --> 12:24.220
Other games I've been playing this week. Another game that I bought that a lot of

12:24.220 --> 12:26.380
people have been going, why would you buy that? Time Pilot

12:26.380 --> 12:31.520
on Xbox Live Arcade. Now look, this was one of my favorite 80's games.

12:31.520 --> 12:35.280
Like, it was kinda like my cultish game that I really liked. That and Gyruss.

12:35.280 --> 12:38.960
I know they're both Konami games just by coincidence. Those are like the shooters that I absolutely love.

12:38.960 --> 12:42.720
So, I was really excited to see Time Pilot was coming out the Xbox 360.

12:42.720 --> 12:45.780
It's cool that you can play with original graphics as well as enhanced.

12:45.780 --> 12:51.280
The enhanced graphics aren't exactly going to, you know, rock your world by any means.

12:51.280 --> 12:55.580
It's probably Super Nintendo level graphics, but I mean, I guess it's kind of nice to have

12:55.580 --> 12:56.580
them.

12:56.580 --> 12:59.220
Otherwise, the game has super easy achievements.

12:59.220 --> 13:02.300
I probably got about eight achievements the first time I played through the game, but

13:02.300 --> 13:05.380
maybe that's just because I played it before, so I kind of, you know, was already decent

13:05.380 --> 13:07.500
at it.

13:07.500 --> 13:10.300
So I don't think there's going to be a lot here that's going to win a person over.

13:10.300 --> 13:11.620
I mean, it's five dollars.

13:11.620 --> 13:12.620
It's not that expensive.

13:12.620 --> 13:14.500
I would say check out the demo.

13:14.500 --> 13:19.300
If you like those Geometry Wars-ish shooting games and you want another easy to pick up

13:19.300 --> 13:23.180
shooter, or you're an Achievement Points horror, I think Time Pilot's pretty decent.

13:23.180 --> 13:24.580
I think it's worth a look.

13:24.580 --> 13:27.540
I think the game that they're putting out next week though, Scramble, I think I'm gonna

13:27.540 --> 13:28.980
totally pass on that one.

13:28.980 --> 13:31.140
That was not a Konami game I remember by any means.

13:31.140 --> 13:34.540
I think Gradius should have been the one we were getting instead, but that's just me.

13:34.540 --> 13:36.340
Maybe they're waiting on that one, I don't know.

13:36.340 --> 13:37.340
Whatever.

13:37.340 --> 13:41.140
And then the other game I played this week was Enchanted Arms.

13:41.140 --> 13:42.940
I didn't like the game at first.

13:42.940 --> 13:47.140
Well, it's not that I didn't like it, I thought it was just like a real average RPG

13:47.140 --> 13:54.440
and I was kind of like, okay, am I only liking this because it's the first real next-gen Japanese RPG we're getting?

13:54.440 --> 13:58.640
I don't count Oblivion, you guys, that's more of a PC-based RPG.

13:58.640 --> 13:59.740
More of an American RPG.

13:59.740 --> 14:04.640
I don't count Final Fantasy XI because that's not really a next-gen RPG.

14:04.640 --> 14:10.740
Yeah, and it's an MMO, so this is really the first Japanese-style RPG we're getting on the Xbox 360.

14:10.740 --> 14:14.620
and because of that the graphics are gorgeous in a lot of places in the game

14:14.620 --> 14:17.620
I don't think it's as good as it could be but I think a lot of the cut scenes

14:17.620 --> 14:20.940
are really really good I think a lot of the battle though looks like PlayStation 2

14:20.940 --> 14:24.220
and some of the graphic stuff annoys me like if you use big

14:24.220 --> 14:27.740
characters in your party sometimes it blocks other characters you can't even

14:27.740 --> 14:28.300
see them

14:28.300 --> 14:32.060
some very basic camera controls could've been put into battle to make it a lot

14:32.060 --> 14:35.440
easier to see. The English voice acting

14:35.440 --> 14:39.180
some of it is just downright god awful

14:39.180 --> 14:43.020
some of it is really, really bad. But at least they have the Japanese track in there.

14:43.020 --> 14:46.260
Exactly, so that's the silver lining is that they left the original

14:46.260 --> 14:47.900
Japanese track in there for you to use.

14:47.900 --> 14:51.060
I have been listening to the English voice acting just because I was, you know,

14:51.060 --> 14:51.700
I wanted to

14:51.700 --> 14:55.060
basically review it for the show, but I will probably switch over to

14:55.060 --> 14:58.340
Japanese voice acting a little later on. Otherwise the game itself,

14:58.340 --> 15:01.380
I wouldn't say it's the greatest RPG

15:01.380 --> 15:04.700
or it's even as good as a Final Fantasy style game, but it's

15:04.700 --> 15:09.220
It's decent. It's pretty good. I think if you like these types of role-playing games,

15:09.220 --> 15:14.380
you're going to like this. The battle system is a little weird. It's half-tactical. Basically,

15:14.380 --> 15:17.820
you move around a 12-square grid and put in your attacks, and you kind of have to think

15:17.820 --> 15:21.620
about where your characters are positioned might make it easier for the enemy to attack

15:21.620 --> 15:26.740
you. So it's somewhat tactical, but still old-fashioned style as well. There's a lot

15:26.740 --> 15:30.540
of customization ability. It kind of has a Pokemon-ish element in it, because there's

15:30.540 --> 15:33.280
There's a hundred different golem creatures you can use.

15:33.280 --> 15:37.500
The story started off very cliche, and it's still a little bit cliche as far as Japanese

15:37.500 --> 15:39.300
RPGs go, but it's getting better.

15:39.300 --> 15:44.540
I find that if you stay with the game, up until about, there's a major event that happens

15:44.540 --> 15:48.700
about two hours into the game that has a really gorgeous cutscene with it, and I think the

15:48.700 --> 15:50.820
game gets a lot better after that point.

15:50.820 --> 15:55.380
I wanted to ask this, though, because I am a gay gamer, and Miglotov, I know you are

15:55.380 --> 15:56.380
too.

15:56.380 --> 16:01.580
getting a lot of talk because it has a gay character in it named Makoto and

16:01.580 --> 16:07.260
Makoto is very let's say flamboyant imagine Carson the blonde guy from Queer Eye

16:07.260 --> 16:13.180
who's like a bard character he plays a sax or something and he talks like this

16:13.180 --> 16:18.660
he talks like James from Pokemon if you've ever watched that show and I'm

16:18.660 --> 16:22.740
like wow doesn't yes he does he totally has a voice if anything he talks more

16:22.740 --> 16:25.980
like Xander from drawn together okay well what do you think of this do you

16:25.980 --> 16:30.220
think it's a good thing for gay gamers do you think it sets us back two years

16:30.220 --> 16:37.460
what do you think it's a bad thing but but I don't I don't like him but I like

16:37.460 --> 16:44.500
how they're handling it like how him hanging off Toya nobody seems to care in

16:44.500 --> 16:49.220
the game and nobody comments about it so that's pretty cool yeah that's why I

16:49.220 --> 16:53.820
What I kind of like is that I don't like him per se, but I like the fact that in the rest

16:53.820 --> 16:57.860
of the world, it's just viewed as a, you know, oh, it's who he likes.

16:57.860 --> 17:01.880
And like there's a Toya fan club that you run into in the beginning that has like women

17:01.880 --> 17:05.000
in it and then one other guy in it that's just like a minor character.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.920
You know, they just kind of like that it's just whatever.

17:07.920 --> 17:09.880
You know, it's not one way or the other.

17:09.880 --> 17:13.800
But I think it's very interesting and a very risky thing to do in an Xbox 360 game because,

17:13.800 --> 17:18.760
you know, you think of the typical stereotypical Xbox audience, you know, Madden 07 and all

17:18.760 --> 17:22.360
that stuff and I think it would be very shocking and I can imagine a lot of

17:22.360 --> 17:28.560
people going ew ew ew gross but I think they need that I think they need that I

17:28.560 --> 17:33.760
don't know but I think it's kind of neat so it's it's a step in the right

17:33.760 --> 17:38.280
direction even if the character was done a little over-the-top to put it lightly

17:38.280 --> 17:45.760
I think it's a good thing overall and can I do a spoiler no jerk all right

17:45.760 --> 17:50.720
Blaze in our chat room says that's how the world should be. I agree. So you know

17:50.720 --> 17:54.960
maybe it's a utopia view of the world. I don't know. But anyway, those are the

17:54.960 --> 17:58.840
games I've been playing this week. I do kind of recommend Enchanted Arms.

17:58.840 --> 18:03.280
I think if you're into Japanese RPGs and you own an Xbox 360, you really should

18:03.280 --> 18:06.160
take a look at this game. But if you haven't really played these types of

18:06.160 --> 18:08.960
games before, I don't think this is the one that's gonna win you over. But I

18:08.960 --> 18:14.280
think this is a good one to appease fans of Japanese RPGs. Alright, let's get

18:14.280 --> 18:17.440
Let's get into some housekeeping news tonight.

18:17.440 --> 18:21.780
First off, I know some of you folks might be listening tonight for the DDR Power Previews

18:21.780 --> 18:26.680
which we were promoting, and if you've noticed on Orangelauntrader.com, we were requested

18:26.680 --> 18:30.080
earlier this week by Konami to suspend that for the time being.

18:30.080 --> 18:33.680
Some things are going on behind the scenes where they just weren't ready for us to do

18:33.680 --> 18:34.680
that.

18:34.680 --> 18:39.480
So we're hoping that, and I don't know why, there's a million reasons we can theorize,

18:39.480 --> 18:42.480
but long story short, it's just not happening tonight.

18:42.480 --> 18:47.440
The good news is it does look like we will be getting to debut some type of new tracks

18:47.440 --> 18:49.920
from UltraMix 4 and Universe.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.400
Konami of Hawaii has been really good in working with us.

18:52.400 --> 18:57.120
I think we will have something possibly as soon as next week, so keep your eyes peeled

18:57.120 --> 18:58.120
on the website.

18:58.120 --> 19:01.680
I do think it's going to happen in one form or another, and you will hear new songs that

19:01.680 --> 19:05.800
you have not heard yet here on Orange Lounge Radio and over on AllGames.com, so just stay

19:05.800 --> 19:06.800
tuned to the website.

19:06.800 --> 19:10.380
I apologize for anyone that was tuning in, ready to hear it tonight.

19:10.380 --> 19:14.220
things happen it's beyond our control I especially feel bad for any folks

19:14.220 --> 19:17.540
because I know it got picked up on a bunch of Japanese game news sites and

19:17.540 --> 19:23.340
they may not have gotten the translation from the latest news tonight so no DDR

19:23.340 --> 19:27.820
power previews tonight again apologies hopefully it will happen next week

19:27.820 --> 19:33.340
Konami asked us to not do it it's beyond our control sorry so stay tuned the site

19:33.340 --> 19:38.660
other housekeeping news it is a three-day weekend and if you've been in

19:38.660 --> 19:41.660
in our chat room tonight, you'll know that Loki and myself have started the drinking

19:41.660 --> 19:42.660
tonight.

19:42.660 --> 19:46.100
Now, a few things I want to say about drunk shows.

19:46.100 --> 19:51.500
A, we do this because we can, because people out there say, oh, professionals shouldn't

19:51.500 --> 19:52.500
drink while we're on the job.

19:52.500 --> 19:56.620
Well, we're not professionals, and we're perfectly fine with that, so shove it.

19:56.620 --> 19:59.580
And the other thing is that people say, wait a minute, Rob, aren't you being a little bit

19:59.580 --> 20:03.520
of a hypocrite, because last week you were saying, you were criticizing those folks that

20:03.520 --> 20:06.060
had gone to the press event and were drinking at the press event.

20:06.060 --> 20:08.300
Well, there's a big difference here, you see.

20:08.300 --> 20:11.020
That's because they were drinking in someone else's house.

20:11.020 --> 20:15.140
If we were guests on, let's say, Scott's show, Bobby's show, whatever podcast they

20:15.140 --> 20:16.140
want to have us on.

20:16.140 --> 20:17.420
Loke, do you think we'd go on their show drunk?

20:17.420 --> 20:19.460
No, unless they were doing it.

20:19.460 --> 20:25.100
No, unless they asked us to, but really, we would probably not do that.

20:25.100 --> 20:29.700
We would have the respect to be our professional self, but while we're in our own house,

20:29.700 --> 20:31.020
we can do whatever we want.

20:31.020 --> 20:33.660
So that's the difference.

20:33.660 --> 20:37.640
If you want to call us a hypocrite after hearing that, whatever, I don't care.

20:37.640 --> 20:42.860
The other thing I want to say is that, again, please, if you do drink, drink responsibly.

20:42.860 --> 20:44.600
Loki and I, Loki has other transportation.

20:44.600 --> 20:45.600
The wife is here.

20:45.600 --> 20:46.600
He will not be driving.

20:46.600 --> 20:48.560
I live here at the studio, so I will not be driving.

20:48.560 --> 20:49.840
Miklotov is here to babysit.

20:49.840 --> 20:50.840
He's not drinking either.

20:50.840 --> 20:51.840
No.

20:51.840 --> 20:55.360
And actually, Loki's wife has told him that if he throws up at all tonight, he will be

20:55.360 --> 20:56.360
spending the night in my bed.

20:56.360 --> 20:57.680
It would be a little weird.

20:57.680 --> 21:00.840
I do not want to see throw up tonight, so please don't.

21:00.840 --> 21:01.840
We'll be fine.

21:01.840 --> 21:02.840
We'll take it easy.

21:02.840 --> 21:03.840
Yeah, exactly.

21:03.840 --> 21:06.960
it kinda after the whole bachelor party thing, it's made me

21:06.960 --> 21:10.240
it's made it hard for me to drink actually just because

21:10.240 --> 21:14.160
I'm such in that mental mindset now where it's gross to even drink

21:14.160 --> 21:18.040
it was hard enough to start drinking orange juice again

21:18.040 --> 21:22.200
cause you know all I drink you know for those who don't know is screwdrivers

21:22.200 --> 21:25.520
except tonight I've actually switched with Rob he's drinking screwdrivers and I'm

21:25.520 --> 21:26.880
drinking some watermelon thing

21:26.880 --> 21:29.920
even that is pretty tough

21:29.920 --> 21:33.360
for me to drink and it's just like all mental right now so I'm not trying to

21:33.360 --> 21:37.280
overdo it at all. In fact, I'm pretty sure I'm probably not going to get too drunk tonight,

21:37.280 --> 21:44.880
so whatever. I just don't have a salt shaker around me to be able to down them super fast

21:44.880 --> 21:45.880
like I used to.

21:45.880 --> 21:51.720
Alright, so you know, you folks at home, if you're under 21, you shouldn't be drinking.

21:51.720 --> 21:57.320
Don't drink alone, because when you drink alone for fun, that might be a sign of a problem.

21:57.320 --> 22:02.180
I don't know. There's a difference between one glass of wine and other stuff, but I've

22:02.180 --> 22:05.620
I've just known people who've had a problem in my past and it's not an easy thing to do.

22:05.620 --> 22:09.180
The other thing I was thinking about bringing over but I didn't, I was going to get drunk

22:09.180 --> 22:10.180
off a kosher wine.

22:10.180 --> 22:11.180
Which would have been funny.

22:11.180 --> 22:13.180
That would have been funny.

22:13.180 --> 22:17.620
Alright, anyway, let's get into some gaming news, shall we?

22:17.620 --> 22:18.620
Yes, we shall.

22:18.620 --> 22:20.620
And we have some exclusives tonight, right Loki?

22:20.620 --> 22:21.620
We have lots of stuff.

22:21.620 --> 22:22.620
Awesome.

22:22.620 --> 22:23.620
What happened?

22:23.620 --> 22:24.620
How did you land so many exclusives this week?

22:24.620 --> 22:28.260
Well once a year, actually we started this last year, we have the game publishers out

22:28.260 --> 22:31.640
to basically give us their rundown of the fourth quarter.

22:31.640 --> 22:36.740
It's quite brief usually, but it is a two day event and we have like a party the night

22:36.740 --> 22:38.700
before where they get all drunk and stuff.

22:38.700 --> 22:39.700
That's always fun.

22:39.700 --> 22:45.840
And then we do these kind of like 15 minute sales meetings and each person talks to us

22:45.840 --> 22:48.980
about what's coming out and we get to ask them questions and they get to tell us stuff

22:48.980 --> 22:51.440
that may not be common knowledge.

22:51.440 --> 22:56.480
So starting things off here, which is actually kind of cool.

22:56.480 --> 22:58.880
This year for the first time we had Nintendo come out.

22:58.880 --> 23:03.600
So obviously the question on everyone's mind, when the hell is the week coming out?

23:03.600 --> 23:04.600
When is this coming out?

23:04.600 --> 23:09.960
And to be honest, the guy was very tight-lipped about it, except for a few things.

23:09.960 --> 23:13.340
It is most definitely going to be announced on the 14th.

23:13.340 --> 23:18.520
He said it's actually going to be announced in Japan as well at the same time, which is

23:18.520 --> 23:21.200
kind of funny because the news story came out afterwards about that same...

23:21.200 --> 23:24.460
I was going to say it lines up with a story that came out later this week that said they're

23:24.460 --> 23:27.240
going to have multi-regional press events, so that makes sense.

23:27.240 --> 23:31.480
So he has confirmed though it is going to be a November launch.

23:31.480 --> 23:34.780
He said 100% November launch.

23:34.780 --> 23:36.720
This is based on his knowledge and what he knows so far.

23:36.720 --> 23:37.720
So ouch.

23:37.720 --> 23:42.020
So the October 18th date that we were so certain of just got shot down this week.

23:42.020 --> 23:43.020
What went wrong?

23:43.020 --> 23:44.360
Why were we wrong on October 18th?

23:44.360 --> 23:50.020
We were wrong because the launch right now, he doesn't know exactly when it is.

23:50.020 --> 23:54.280
It's November, but they're trying to time it either two weeks before the PS3 launch

23:54.280 --> 23:55.280
or a week after.

23:55.280 --> 23:59.040
because they don't want their thunder being stolen by Sony.

23:59.040 --> 24:00.040
The thing is...

24:00.040 --> 24:03.640
So wait, you're telling me Nintendo themselves doesn't even know when they're launching

24:03.640 --> 24:05.280
this system as of yet?

24:05.280 --> 24:08.400
Well, he hasn't been told the final date yet.

24:08.400 --> 24:11.640
The reason why is they're waiting on the amount of units that they have in production.

24:11.640 --> 24:15.020
They're making sure that they have enough to launch because they're doing a worldwide

24:15.020 --> 24:22.620
launch, and that's pretty much it, but it will not delay the launch past Thanksgiving.

24:22.620 --> 24:27.060
So it will be before, you know, that gives you a pretty good range there of when it's

24:27.060 --> 24:28.060
going to be.

24:28.060 --> 24:31.420
So if Nintendo themselves doesn't even know the launch date, or at least maybe a very

24:31.420 --> 24:35.260
very few select people know it at this point inside Nintendo, would it be safe to say that

24:35.260 --> 24:39.580
any story you have read on the internet about launch date today is bullshit, including the

24:39.580 --> 24:40.580
one we ran?

24:40.580 --> 24:41.580
Yeah.

24:41.580 --> 24:42.580
Okay.

24:42.580 --> 24:46.180
And mine, remember mine was just purely speculation because of the anniversary and all that stuff.

24:46.180 --> 24:49.560
But that would make sense because if Nintendo themselves has kind of not really known the

24:49.560 --> 24:54.500
date they wanted to do based on units, which would explain why they didn't do anything

24:54.500 --> 24:55.500
at E3.

24:55.500 --> 24:56.500
And you know what?

24:56.500 --> 24:57.500
The whole thing could be a ruse.

24:57.500 --> 24:58.500
The whole thing could be a ruse.

24:58.500 --> 24:59.500
They could go, you know what?

24:59.500 --> 25:01.780
We're launching in two weeks, you know, after the whole press event.

25:01.780 --> 25:05.140
So it's possible this guy at your event was just yanking your chain with the whole thing.

25:05.140 --> 25:06.240
I don't think he's yanking my chain.

25:06.240 --> 25:09.460
I think this is actually what he knows, and to be honest, I would think that they're not

25:09.460 --> 25:10.460
launching in November.

25:10.460 --> 25:13.500
It makes sense because, you know, you want to make sure you have the most units so you

25:13.500 --> 25:17.380
can sell as much as possible so you don't run into the shortages.

25:17.380 --> 25:21.240
Some interesting stuff though, they are spending 30 million dollars in marketing this thing.

25:21.240 --> 25:24.200
That's twice as much as the GameCube.

25:24.200 --> 25:25.380
So it's definitely going to be out there.

25:25.380 --> 25:28.440
They're not going to have in-store kiosks.

25:28.440 --> 25:32.360
The reason why they're not is because of the setup issues with this thing.

25:32.360 --> 25:36.100
Because it has that sensor bar, it would make it very difficult for them to be able to set

25:36.100 --> 25:40.480
up and they want to make sure that they have people viewing it in the correct way.

25:40.480 --> 25:43.720
So wait a minute, I distinctly remember seeing a story on Digg earlier this week that were

25:43.720 --> 25:46.720
mockups of a Playstation 3 and a Wii kiosk.

25:46.720 --> 25:48.040
Bullshit, you're saying.

25:48.040 --> 25:50.060
Based on what you heard here it's bullshit.

25:50.060 --> 25:54.320
According to what he knew it's bullshit but I think, I really do think that they are,

25:54.320 --> 25:57.880
they've got to have in-store kiosks but I don't know.

25:57.880 --> 25:59.000
You know the other thing too?

25:59.000 --> 26:04.000
That kiosk could have been mockup for a convention kiosk or something like that.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.460
Because they have you know their kiosks at conventions and stuff like that.

26:07.460 --> 26:09.300
I'm sure they're gonna have something in store.

26:09.300 --> 26:13.580
I don't know why they wouldn't but according to him they're not because it'd be hard

26:13.580 --> 26:14.580
for them to set up.

26:14.580 --> 26:19.140
think that they will, but whatever. There is one interesting thing. They're going the

26:19.140 --> 26:23.640
Xbox route with the DVD player in it. It's going to be an add-on and not included in

26:23.640 --> 26:28.680
the box. So you've got to get this extra dongle or whatever to put on it to be able to play

26:28.680 --> 26:34.440
DVDs. But, his thought on it was, who doesn't own a DVD player by now? I mean, seriously.

26:34.440 --> 26:39.840
Everybody owns a DVD player. It's not a big deal. So, that's kind of neat.

26:39.840 --> 26:46.040
Moving on from Nintendo a little bit to Midway and this was kind of interesting.

26:46.040 --> 26:49.320
Wait, has that DVD player rumor been announced anywhere?

26:49.320 --> 26:50.320
I don't know.

26:50.320 --> 26:51.320
Interesting.

26:51.320 --> 26:55.840
Here is something interesting from Midway and I asked them twice when I heard this.

26:55.840 --> 26:58.800
Blitz the League for the Wii is not coming out.

26:58.800 --> 27:01.760
Not coming, not happening, definitely not at launch.

27:01.760 --> 27:03.960
It is cancelled as far as they are concerned.

27:03.960 --> 27:07.200
So not happening.

27:07.200 --> 27:09.900
They are basically concerned with launching Rampage.

27:09.900 --> 27:14.560
Rampage, I guess, is going to be their big title for, I don't know, the launch, which

27:14.560 --> 27:18.700
is kind of stupid because Rampage really sucked as a game.

27:18.700 --> 27:24.900
But anyways, kind of moving on here, our friends at Activision, we're talking to them, and

27:24.900 --> 27:30.020
this is actually, I saw the story, you know, about Guitar Hero 2, the bundle will be coming

27:30.020 --> 27:32.420
with a red guitar controller, which is kind of cool.

27:32.420 --> 27:38.020
They said the next Guitar Hero after 2 will be for the 360, which is pretty sweet.

27:38.020 --> 27:42.740
They're also saying according to what they've heard about the PlayStation 3 online service,

27:42.740 --> 27:47.220
it will not be free, which is also interesting.

27:47.220 --> 27:52.300
Now speaking with Konami, they were saying that Castlevania Portrait of Ruin is actually

27:52.300 --> 27:57.620
delayed until early December, which is interesting.

27:57.620 --> 28:01.260
Also and I have asked him twice about this because this didn't make sense and I don't

28:01.260 --> 28:05.940
know Shane if you know anything about this he said that for universe all the

28:05.940 --> 28:10.200
song packs from Ultramix the Ultramix series will be transferable to

28:10.200 --> 28:18.340
universe I never heard that yeah that was interesting because I asked I'm like

28:18.340 --> 28:22.380
are you sure how would that be possible exactly that didn't make any sense to me

28:22.380 --> 28:25.780
I'm thinking this guy might have been confusing Ultramix for it because that

28:25.780 --> 28:29.780
would make sense but I like maybe Ultramix for in universe have the same

28:29.780 --> 28:33.860
song packs or something. Maybe. Maybe they're gonna have the same sound packs later on.

28:33.860 --> 28:37.540
But I asked them again, I'm like, are you sure? I'm like, that seemed a little weird.

28:37.540 --> 28:43.140
He said, yes, universe will be able to play the song packs from UltraMix. I'm like, okay,

28:43.140 --> 28:48.540
so take that with a grain of salt. Okay, DarkTisker brings up a good point in chat room. UltraMix

28:48.540 --> 28:53.280
1-4 aren't on the backward compatibility list, so how would that work? I don't know. Unless

28:53.280 --> 28:56.280
plan on re-releasing the song packs or something?

28:56.280 --> 28:57.280
Huh.

28:57.280 --> 29:00.280
I don't see.

29:00.280 --> 29:05.640
Anyways, um, let's see here.

29:05.640 --> 29:11.520
According to Sega, Phantasy Star Universe, on the 360 there will be no charge for the

29:11.520 --> 29:14.040
online service, which is pretty good.

29:14.040 --> 29:18.480
There will be a charge, a monthly fee for Playstation 2 and PC users, so that kinda

29:18.480 --> 29:19.480
sucks for them.

29:19.480 --> 29:25.540
almost be worth it for me to get a 360 again, just to get PSU with no monthly charge.

29:25.540 --> 29:29.760
Sonic the Secret of the Rings, or you might remember Sonic Wildfire, not a launch title

29:29.760 --> 29:36.920
for the Wii. Coming March 2007, so look for that then, there will not be full auto 2 on

29:36.920 --> 29:44.860
the Xbox 360 at all. Not later, not ever. Because the first one didn't sell very well,

29:44.860 --> 29:48.900
so they're not bringing it back.

29:48.900 --> 29:51.900
I wonder why they think that it will sell well on the PS3.

29:51.900 --> 29:56.160
Well, they're not sure, they're just trying a different audience, so that's really what

29:56.160 --> 29:57.160
it is.

29:57.160 --> 30:02.880
This is really weird because in the scope of about five minutes, you've contradicted

30:02.880 --> 30:06.700
about seven different news stories that have ran out there previously.

30:06.700 --> 30:08.260
I know, what can I say?

30:08.260 --> 30:09.260
Okay.

30:09.260 --> 30:13.620
I hope you're right or we're going to look stupid.

30:13.620 --> 30:16.220
So marketing people could be wrong and therefore you're wrong.

30:16.220 --> 30:17.220
Yeah.

30:17.220 --> 30:18.220
So at least we have an out.

30:18.220 --> 30:19.500
These are not marketing people.

30:19.500 --> 30:20.660
These are sales associates.

30:20.660 --> 30:23.100
These are vice presidents of sales and stuff.

30:23.100 --> 30:25.060
So I would assume that they know what they're talking about.

30:25.060 --> 30:26.060
Alright.

30:26.060 --> 30:27.060
Fair enough.

30:27.060 --> 30:29.360
LucasArts, which is awesome, they came out.

30:29.360 --> 30:33.500
The Wii Star Wars game is in development, will not be done until late 2007 or early

30:33.500 --> 30:34.500
2008.

30:34.500 --> 30:37.800
They want to make sure they get it right because they have a rabid fan base of Star Wars fans

30:37.800 --> 30:43.600
and you know, obviously they mix it with rabid Wii fans and they want to make sure they don't

30:43.600 --> 30:48.040
fuck this up. So that's mainly the case. The next gen Star Wars game is going to be coming

30:48.040 --> 30:53.620
in fall of 2007. And also Indiana Jones the next gen game will be released at the same

30:53.620 --> 31:01.740
time as the new movie, which is confirmed in pre-production from them. Let's see here.

31:01.740 --> 31:07.280
I had Vinvetti, they were talking about the Scarface game and one of the funny bits of

31:07.280 --> 31:12.380
trivia from it is that the voice actor that they picked for Tony Montana is actually Al

31:12.380 --> 31:15.060
Al Pacino's driver.

31:15.060 --> 31:20.660
And apparently because Al Pacino can't do Tony's voice anymore due to his age, so apparently

31:20.660 --> 31:23.260
his driver can mimic the character's voice.

31:23.260 --> 31:27.540
Say hello to my little friend.

31:27.540 --> 31:29.100
Now here's some really interesting stuff.

31:29.100 --> 31:30.100
Ubisoft.

31:30.100 --> 31:34.820
GT, that racing game that they announced, it's going to come with a steering wheel add-on

31:34.820 --> 31:35.920
for the Wii.

31:35.920 --> 31:39.380
And this is going to be something that you plug the Wii controller in the middle of it?

31:39.380 --> 31:40.380
Yes you do!

31:40.380 --> 31:41.380
That is hot!

31:41.380 --> 31:50.140
You do not need it to play it, but you do not need it to play the game, but it will

31:50.140 --> 31:53.860
be just something that you can slap the controller into to play it, which I thought that was

31:53.860 --> 31:54.860
very cool.

31:54.860 --> 31:59.100
You know, someone actually thinking about how to use the system.

31:59.100 --> 32:01.420
There is a new Prince of Persia game coming for the PSP.

32:01.420 --> 32:06.020
It's going to be based on the Two Thrones game that was out last fall.

32:06.020 --> 32:10.540
It'll feature multiplayer and new chariot races.

32:10.540 --> 32:14.300
the working title is just Prince of Persia. So they haven't really made an announcement yet.

32:14.300 --> 32:18.700
Now for once that lines up with something I did read on the rest of the internet a couple weeks

32:18.700 --> 32:23.340
ago. That was actually the DS one that you're reading about, I think. Far Crying in the We

32:23.340 --> 32:27.740
looks pretty awesome from what I've seen so far. The pictures look pretty cool, the screenshots, so

32:28.380 --> 32:33.660
that was pretty neat. Koei. Blade Storm the Hundred Years War not coming out at launch,

32:33.660 --> 32:39.500
it's going to be quarter one of 2007 and I guess it is in the launch window, but whatever.

32:39.500 --> 32:44.700
uh... guitar man lives gonna have online play and new songs that's hot

32:44.700 --> 32:47.020
uh... which is not already come out

32:47.020 --> 32:52.100
and you know how it may be in your honor but it's coming up october here

32:52.100 --> 32:55.400
new romance of the three kingdoms game coming on the playstation two quarter

32:55.400 --> 32:59.100
one a quarter to two thousand seven which should be interesting

32:59.100 --> 33:00.020
now the big one

33:00.020 --> 33:01.580
microsoft

33:01.580 --> 33:03.900
no price drops no bundles

33:03.900 --> 33:07.240
whatsoever for three sixty they're not worried because the competition is two

33:07.240 --> 33:11.840
$200 more expensive than them. In fact, they were unaware that Canada, because Canada kind

33:11.840 --> 33:16.220
of operates a little bit independent than the US, Microsoft was doing a bundle until

33:16.220 --> 33:22.600
after it had been announced. And much hate mail was exchanged according to our rep. Gears

33:22.600 --> 33:27.360
of War is coming out November 7th, not November 12th. November 12th is actually emergency,

33:27.360 --> 33:34.920
which is their big marketing push. Wait, that makes absolutely no sense at all. Why would

33:34.920 --> 33:38.680
they have all this huge hype over Emergence Day, Emergence Day, and then you're telling

33:38.680 --> 33:40.760
me the game's coming out five days earlier?

33:40.760 --> 33:44.560
The game is coming out on the 7th because you can't really launch a game on a Wednesday.

33:44.560 --> 33:47.600
That's when everybody's getting in the game is on the 7th.

33:47.600 --> 33:51.240
Now stores, you know, some stores are waiting until the 12th because they're confused on

33:51.240 --> 33:54.880
this Emergence Day thing, but the Emergence Day is when they're gonna be doing all the

33:54.880 --> 33:59.800
big ad pushes, the, you know, their campaigns, they're playing with fame type thing.

33:59.800 --> 34:01.360
Could it be like, cause didn't Halo launch on a Friday?

34:01.360 --> 34:04.180
So could it be like that where maybe the stores are getting it that day but they're not supposed

34:04.180 --> 34:08.700
to sell it until the 12th? No, according to him, they can sell it when they get it. And

34:08.700 --> 34:13.640
this was also kind of ties in with another story that we had earlier about the same thing.

34:13.640 --> 34:17.300
And I can confirm that it's always been the 7th, but I thought it was weird that they

34:17.300 --> 34:23.480
were selling it on a Sunday. This is the best one right here. Halo 3. Now everybody thinks

34:23.480 --> 34:29.500
it's coming out in the fall of 2007. No. March or April of 2007 is the date for Halo

34:29.500 --> 34:36.740
three what that is they said it's ready to roll in March or April so I would

34:36.740 --> 34:42.340
they be sitting on that I don't know but that's are you sure you didn't pull this

34:42.340 --> 34:46.980
out of your ass that I did not pull it out my ass I asked him world we cuz we

34:46.980 --> 34:50.820
asked him about hail three do you have a date on hail three he's all he's all

34:50.820 --> 34:55.900
it's gonna be April March or April of 2007 he's all it's not gonna be the fall

34:55.900 --> 35:00.300
if I was a betting man I'd say it's you know the end of spring so okay but you

35:00.300 --> 35:03.180
know what that doesn't sound like he knew for sure because he says if I was a

35:03.180 --> 35:08.260
betting man I would do did it so I cuz they may why would you launch a game I

35:08.260 --> 35:13.100
don't know April especially before e3 or whatever well here's here's my thought

35:13.100 --> 35:17.100
on it yeah I think even though I know everything the same thing this year but

35:17.100 --> 35:21.220
this makes perfect sense when you think about it this way no I'm not sure about

35:21.220 --> 35:25.700
Microsoft but a lot of game companies the big pushes are either in quarter

35:25.700 --> 35:32.180
4 of 2007 for our quarter 4 of the year for the Christmas push and March because

35:32.180 --> 35:36.340
that's the end of their fiscal year so if you think about it if this game comes

35:36.340 --> 35:42.860
out the end of their fiscal year that looks pretty good numbers wise huh okay

35:42.860 --> 35:47.940
okay just something to think about the 79 99 vision camera bundle that's gonna

35:47.940 --> 35:51.420
coming on is actually replacing 12 month live bundle that's out there right now

35:51.420 --> 35:55.420
so that's gonna be the new 12 month bundle that you're gonna be getting he

35:55.420 --> 35:59.840
I wouldn't mention what three games were in it, but I think that's already been out anyways.

36:00.640 --> 36:06.720
And then finally we have Atari, Alone in the Dark is set for mid-2007, they're not releasing

36:06.720 --> 36:11.440
the game until it's perfect because according to our rep and his words, they've already

36:11.440 --> 36:15.020
ruined enough franchises, and it will be episodic.

36:15.960 --> 36:20.220
Test Drive Unlimited, which is coming out actually next week, will be getting download

36:20.220 --> 36:26.360
packs each month. They're planned up until June of next year so far. The first two packs

36:26.360 --> 36:31.000
will be Lexus cars. There's no word of these cars, they're going to be free, but Lexus

36:31.000 --> 36:36.560
paid a quarter million dollars to get the cars in the game. It says all the download

36:36.560 --> 36:42.840
packs will range from free to $7.99 or the Microsoft equivalent in points. That's all

36:42.840 --> 36:48.920
the big news from our wonderful meetings. You know, Nintendo Maniac 64 has a good point.

36:48.920 --> 36:54.460
came out March it's the end of their fiscal year and that I mean I would

36:54.460 --> 36:58.060
think that they would wait until the fall I mean but then again maybe they

36:58.060 --> 37:02.620
want to make sure that you know people because think about this Microsoft is

37:02.620 --> 37:06.540
doing something big around the PlayStation 3 launch just some sort of

37:06.540 --> 37:10.580
announcement or event what if that announcement is the halos coming out in

37:10.580 --> 37:14.300
March then people that we're gonna buy a PlayStation 3 they're gonna wait until

37:14.300 --> 37:19.140
this game comes out that's that's it

37:19.140 --> 37:22.700
wow so maybe that's just the liquor

37:22.700 --> 37:24.540
talking but that makes a lot of sense

37:24.540 --> 37:26.540
now that you put it that way

37:26.540 --> 37:28.240
I don't know what okay would you say if

37:28.240 --> 37:30.300
November goes by and we still haven't

37:30.300 --> 37:32.700
heard anything that maybe something's up

37:32.700 --> 37:33.940
I think if they're going to announce

37:33.940 --> 37:35.440
anything it's going to be a big it's

37:35.440 --> 37:37.140
going to be a halo 3 announcement me is

37:37.140 --> 37:40.020
going to be huge but I don't know I mean

37:40.020 --> 37:42.700
it makes sense I mean you would because

37:42.700 --> 37:44.020
people are like well there's you know

37:44.020 --> 37:48.140
Gears of War is awesome, but, you know, I really want Halo 3, you know, I might be getting

37:48.140 --> 37:52.260
a PlayStation 3 because Resistance looks pretty good, then I'll announce, oh by the way,

37:52.260 --> 37:56.300
Halo's coming out in a few months, you know, then people are like, okay, well I can wait.

37:56.300 --> 37:59.020
Or I'll buy a 360 now, you know, that kind of thing.

37:59.020 --> 38:00.020
I don't know.

38:00.020 --> 38:02.780
That would be just downright evil, but kind of funny.

38:02.780 --> 38:06.620
Well, didn't they say that they were going to, well they were always saying that they

38:06.620 --> 38:09.460
were going to release Halo 3 on the...

38:09.460 --> 38:13.420
Yeah, but I think then everybody realized realistically that can't happen, if Halo

38:13.420 --> 38:18.980
is going to be really good yeah wow but alright we'll see I mean I don't know

38:18.980 --> 38:21.780
take it with a grain of salt but that that's straight from the mouths of

38:21.780 --> 38:27.740
people they're working for these companies you know turbo punk in chat

38:27.740 --> 38:35.100
pure evil I'd expect no less from micro macro shaft so I don't know it was

38:35.100 --> 38:39.140
interesting we were very excited I tried to get more out of the Microsoft guy but

38:39.140 --> 38:43.300
he kind of wanted to talk about stuff that already come out oh no he's weird

38:43.300 --> 38:51.940
Wow. Lots of juicy tidbits there. We will post all this stuff in that thread that we have going,

38:51.940 --> 38:56.380
the under-the-radar thread, so you'll have that for reference in case this stuff actually...

38:56.380 --> 38:58.740
Or he's wrong. He's downright wrong.

38:58.740 --> 38:59.940
Yeah, whatever, you know.

38:59.940 --> 39:03.220
Alright, well this is coming from salespeople. I mean, yeah, sales?

39:03.220 --> 39:04.260
Salespeople, yeah.

39:04.260 --> 39:05.220
I have those sales.

39:05.220 --> 39:11.260
Alright, well one thing we do know about Xbox Live Arcade is that we have this new game that's going

39:11.260 --> 39:16.100
to be coming out and it's called Space Giraffe. Now usually I'd laugh at a game called Space

39:16.100 --> 39:20.460
Giraffe, but what looks pretty awesome about it is that it looks a lot like Tempest, but

39:20.460 --> 39:24.920
a lot trippy, kind of like how Geometry Wars was. Now I remember seeing a screenshot for

39:24.920 --> 39:28.860
this game that had a lot of really dirty words on it, but I can't seem to find that anymore.

39:28.860 --> 39:31.460
I remember that one, yeah. I don't know if that was photoshopped or what, but...

39:31.460 --> 39:32.780
No. No? That's disgusting.

39:32.780 --> 39:34.820
And exactly what the guy did, Tempest 2000.

39:34.820 --> 39:38.420
Because there were some words in there that actually offended me, and that's hard to do,

39:38.420 --> 39:42.360
So hopefully those aren't actually in the game, but we'll see.

39:42.360 --> 39:43.360
That's kind of interesting.

39:43.360 --> 39:46.100
Yeah, there were some pictures posted on LiveJournal or something like that, so that would be pretty

39:46.100 --> 39:47.100
cool.

39:47.100 --> 39:48.100
I love Tempest 2000.

39:48.100 --> 39:52.940
I think it's one of the biggest sleeper hits that people don't appreciate, and it was like

39:52.940 --> 39:56.100
the reason to own a Jaguar was that game.

39:56.100 --> 39:57.500
So there you have it.

39:57.500 --> 40:02.580
I'd be very happy if a game like this came to Xbox Live Arcade more as it develops.

40:02.580 --> 40:07.460
There was also a story this week talking about the Xbox 360 soccer exclusive deals that they

40:07.460 --> 40:11.460
have going on, talking about how the Xbox 360 is going to be the only place that you're

40:11.460 --> 40:16.580
going to be able to get next gen soccer games, or all next gen soccer games I should say,

40:16.580 --> 40:23.580
because FIFA is going to be on both systems and, or was it, Pro Evolution Soccer 6 or

40:23.580 --> 40:28.100
Winning 11 Pro Evolution Soccer 2007, whatever you want to call it.

40:28.100 --> 40:33.660
Here is something that is very interesting though, that's not true.

40:33.660 --> 40:40.820
According to Konami, who was also at our event this week, spoke to the rep there.

40:40.820 --> 40:48.980
The reason why Pro Evolution Soccer, winning 11, whatever, yeah Pro Evolution Soccer 2007,

40:48.980 --> 40:52.300
the reason it's not coming out on the Playstation 3 at launch is because they haven't got the

40:52.300 --> 40:57.580
final dev kits yet and because the game's not going to be done until March, or actually

40:57.580 --> 41:00.480
as late as May according to him.

41:00.480 --> 41:06.080
So yeah, it's only exclusive because it's not finished.

41:06.080 --> 41:11.760
So I'll take it as you will, but I don't know, hmm, interesting.

41:11.760 --> 41:17.660
Well one, I don't remember them saying anything at the barbecue about it being exclusive or

41:17.660 --> 41:20.320
anything and I would have thought if it was going to be exclusive they would have said

41:20.320 --> 41:21.320
something like that.

41:21.320 --> 41:27.440
So, and it seemed like they were, I mean the game was being ported to DS, what else was

41:27.440 --> 41:31.140
was their PSP, and it seemed like they were porting it to other systems anyway, I mean

41:31.140 --> 41:34.440
sure for the handhelds they'd be downgraded versions, but...

41:34.440 --> 41:40.000
Well, think about it, if they didn't really assign an exclusive deal, and I'm not sure

41:40.000 --> 41:44.020
FIFA's coming out on the PlayStation 3, I would figure it is, but maybe not this year,

41:44.020 --> 41:45.020
I don't know.

41:45.020 --> 41:47.360
If that's the case, then there is no soccer game on the...

41:47.360 --> 41:55.800
Now, wait, okay, hold on a minute here, because the guy from Microsoft at the Germany convention

41:55.800 --> 41:59.360
went out there and said we have both franchises exclusive

41:59.360 --> 42:04.600
so you're saying no according to my rep but then again you know

42:04.600 --> 42:08.400
he may be full of shit I don't know huh

42:08.400 --> 42:11.480
I'm just taking Konami's word for it, what can I say?

42:11.480 --> 42:14.960
interesting okay I don't know it's kinda weird

42:14.960 --> 42:19.020
well here's one game we know is not going to be exclusive to either system

42:19.020 --> 42:21.880
and shouldn't be a shock at all there is a burnout 5 coming

42:21.880 --> 42:22.880
Oh my God!

42:22.880 --> 42:23.880
Really?

42:23.880 --> 42:24.880
No, it doesn't make any sense.

42:24.880 --> 42:29.920
And it's coming to the 360 and the PlayStation 3, who would have thought, sometime in 2007.

42:29.920 --> 42:33.520
Now, Burnout is going to be getting a little bit of a makeover.

42:33.520 --> 42:36.500
It's not just going to be rehash of the old same old Burnout.

42:36.500 --> 42:38.120
Thank you EA.

42:38.120 --> 42:42.400
Now this time Burnout will be more of an open world-ish environment.

42:42.400 --> 42:48.560
Players will be able to go in and out of menus at every intersection, possibly a crash course

42:48.560 --> 42:51.040
by going through any type of intersection.

42:51.040 --> 42:58.760
It's going to be taking place in a town called Paradise City.

42:58.760 --> 43:00.880
Why isn't it coming out for the Wii?

43:00.880 --> 43:04.180
No ideas.

43:04.180 --> 43:11.560
They also say, though, EA says, the most explosive pile-ups in the series history.

43:11.560 --> 43:14.280
It is kind of the first true next-gen burnout.

43:14.280 --> 43:18.240
The other one was just a souped-up, old burnout.

43:18.240 --> 43:20.280
That's not a big surprise there.

43:20.280 --> 43:26.000
It's interesting though, Microsoft Japan is talking about bringing Tokyo Game Show and

43:26.000 --> 43:30.080
Exo 6 home.

43:30.080 --> 43:35.920
It sounds like what they did with E3, how they had a bunch of exclusive video and demos

43:35.920 --> 43:41.640
and stuff, and I really hope they do that because with the region free, those logins

43:41.640 --> 43:45.080
that we have, you can download some pretty cool demos.

43:45.080 --> 43:50.100
But yeah, it should be more of that stuff coming around Tokyo Game Show, which is actually

43:50.100 --> 43:59.340
only in a few weeks, I mean, the 24th of September, so it should be pretty cool.

43:59.340 --> 44:00.340
Can't wait to download some of that.

44:00.340 --> 44:01.340
That should be fun.

44:01.340 --> 44:04.700
Well, we kind of already, I mean, it was in our lineup, although we kind of already ruined

44:04.700 --> 44:08.540
this story, but just in case you haven't heard, it was officially announced that there will

44:08.540 --> 44:14.940
be additional Nintendo conferences held in Japan on September 14th and Europe on September

44:14.940 --> 44:19.060
15th, so put it all together and I think that's when you're getting your Wii release date.

44:19.060 --> 44:23.280
It looks like they're going to launch this huge, as you put it earlier, $30 million marketing

44:23.280 --> 44:28.580
campaign on this day, or days, because of the dateline and all that stuff messing everything

44:28.580 --> 44:29.580
up.

44:29.580 --> 44:35.080
And then, of course, it kind of goes on into the Tokyo Game Show, but it should be noted

44:35.080 --> 44:40.200
Nintendo usually doesn't attend Tokyo Game Show, so this might be their way of kind of

44:40.200 --> 44:44.520
doing it on their own terms of publicity, so not a big surprise.

44:44.520 --> 44:48.960
not a huge surprise. What was a pretty big surprise though was Microsoft released another

44:48.960 --> 44:54.400
backwards compatibility update and there was quite a few titles this time actually. They

44:54.400 --> 44:59.940
even had some pretty good stuff like Burnout 3 and Dead to the Rights right after I sold

44:59.940 --> 45:06.940
back Burnout 3. Thank you Microsoft. Fetal Frame 2, Freaky Flyers if you're into that

45:06.960 --> 45:13.120
game, Gauntlet Seven Sorrows, Sid Meier's Pirates, stuff like that. What was interesting

45:13.120 --> 45:17.560
though, and this is a first for the backwards compatibility updates, is they've actually

45:17.560 --> 45:24.440
made something that was not out yet compatible with the system, including such games as Spy

45:24.440 --> 45:29.920
Hunter Nowhere to Run, which is coming out next week, Lego Star Wars 2 on the Xbox, which

45:29.920 --> 45:34.540
that makes no sense since they're releasing the 360 version anyways, and then later on

45:34.540 --> 45:40.280
in October you've got Spyro, or Legend of Spyro, A New Beginning, which is interesting

45:40.280 --> 45:44.680
that they're actually kind of, you know, forward compatibility, I guess? I don't know.

45:44.680 --> 45:49.720
Well, they also had that whole He-Man game was compatible with the 360, and that never

45:49.720 --> 45:52.400
even came out, so that's really far forward into the future.

45:52.400 --> 45:55.920
Yeah, but what if it's one of those things, remember how, like, you know, and I've used

45:55.920 --> 46:00.200
this comparison on this show before when we talk about why certain games on the 360 are

46:00.200 --> 46:03.360
emulated and why they aren't. You know, I don't think the Xbox team went in there with

46:03.360 --> 46:09.360
the intention of making Barbie compatible, but because they made, say, Ninja Gaiden compatible,

46:09.360 --> 46:14.000
fits the same scheme and you go to old Nintendo emulators, once you make a certain mapper

46:14.000 --> 46:16.960
work, most of the other games that run on that mapper work.

46:16.960 --> 46:18.720
Well here's something interesting.

46:18.720 --> 46:22.440
I was talking actually with Midway about, you know, hey did you guys know that this

46:22.440 --> 46:25.600
game has got to add to the compatibility list today?

46:25.600 --> 46:30.720
They're like, no, I didn't hear that but I'm not surprised and they're like, well we actually

46:30.720 --> 46:34.680
know what engine it's built on, it's built on the LA Rush engine, believe it or not.

46:34.680 --> 46:40.840
So they're talking about maybe, what was kind of interesting, the thing I got from that

46:40.840 --> 46:46.260
is that they might actually make a PSP version of that game, I don't know how well the game

46:46.260 --> 46:50.880
is going to do, but because now that they have Rush coming out of the PSP, I thought

46:50.880 --> 46:53.000
that was interesting.

46:53.000 --> 46:56.800
I have to point out this private message I got in chat from Jeremy Todd once.

46:56.800 --> 46:58.320
That's not very private then.

46:58.320 --> 47:01.120
Well, I guess not, but I don't think he'd mind me sharing.

47:01.120 --> 47:06.120
He linked me to a story on GoNintendo.com, which talks about the demo unit, which we

47:06.120 --> 47:07.960
talked about a little bit ago for the Wii.

47:07.960 --> 47:12.700
And apparently, according to GoNintendo, the picture has turned out to be true due to numerous

47:12.700 --> 47:13.880
sources who have informed me.

47:13.880 --> 47:17.560
The same image shows up in a packet sent out to EB GameStop employees to get them ready

47:17.560 --> 47:18.560
for the unit.

47:18.560 --> 47:20.240
I'm glad to hear that it turned out to be real.

47:20.240 --> 47:22.680
I really like the look of it.

47:22.680 --> 47:23.680
I think the whole...

47:23.680 --> 47:28.040
To be honest, the guy said, you know, street crews were the way they were going to demo

47:28.040 --> 47:30.120
it and not the units.

47:30.120 --> 47:35.040
I mean, I don't know, could I mean like a reduction in the units, or?

47:35.040 --> 47:38.880
I think he was gonna, it was gonna be harder to do than maybe the retail units

47:38.880 --> 47:41.980
just because of the setup that's needed for him. Maybe he was talking about

47:41.980 --> 47:45.840
the promotional marketing stuff, they're not doing demoing units like that, like these are

47:45.840 --> 47:49.120
we know that EB's and Gamestop have the in-store units that

47:49.120 --> 47:52.200
they always have, it's not. And to be honest, to be honest you guys,

47:52.200 --> 47:55.320
he was kinda halfway right on some of the stuff

47:55.320 --> 47:59.260
like for example he was saying that, yeah because the problem is if he's wrong here

47:59.260 --> 48:02.120
then it throws all that other Nintendo stuff into question, you know what I mean? Nothing

48:02.120 --> 48:05.200
against you, you're just reporting what you heard, but, you know...

48:05.200 --> 48:09.320
I know, but, I mean, he was mistaken on a couple things, like, he thought Tokyo Game

48:09.320 --> 48:12.700
Show went on at, you know, September 14th, so...

48:12.700 --> 48:14.840
But then again, he's in the U.S., he doesn't go to Tokyo Game Show, so...

48:14.840 --> 48:17.680
And Nintendo doesn't do Tokyo Game Show, so that would make kind of sense.

48:17.680 --> 48:22.320
So all he's hearing, he assumed Tokyo Game Show because he knows that event's coming

48:22.320 --> 48:28.720
up and he figures, you know, it's right about the time, uh, whatever, you know, so...

48:28.720 --> 48:33.440
But one game that is not going to be backwards compatible, but they're still working on it,

48:33.440 --> 48:34.440
Psychonauts.

48:34.440 --> 48:40.980
It was almost ready to ship, or I guess be in this update, but it didn't make the deadline

48:40.980 --> 48:45.500
and says we continue to work on all games, and that's coming from the backwards compatibility

48:45.500 --> 48:46.500
thing.

48:46.500 --> 48:47.500
So, alright.

48:47.500 --> 48:54.380
Well look, all this news about contradicting stories from Nintendo and games that aren't

48:54.380 --> 48:57.900
still backwards compatible is giving me a headache, or maybe it's just the liquor, I

48:57.900 --> 49:02.620
I don't know cuz I'm on my second screwdriver now after a pretty big first one. That's very strong by the way

49:02.620 --> 49:06.780
I mixed this really wrong. Oh, well. It makes me a little bit angsty, and you know what that means

49:12.260 --> 49:14.660
Time for the F use of the week

49:15.580 --> 49:17.580
Loki why don't you start us off tonight?

49:18.380 --> 49:19.800
F you have

49:19.800 --> 49:21.800
These drinks take like ass

49:22.380 --> 49:24.100
No offense. I mean

49:24.100 --> 49:31.340
but it's kind of like a watermelon thing. Don't make it too strong! Mainly my FU this

49:31.340 --> 49:37.360
week goes to people that do not pay attention on the road and who cannot park. And I swear

49:37.360 --> 49:40.460
to God every time I see someone on a cell phone I know that they're going to be driving

49:40.460 --> 49:46.460
like shit. And you can always tell these people that are veering in and out of lanes, going

49:46.460 --> 49:53.020
slow, can't seem to follow the road at all. And then you drive past them and you see they're

49:53.020 --> 49:57.300
yapping away on the cell phone. Well fuck them. Also these people that fucking do not

49:57.300 --> 50:02.300
take the time to park their cars correctly. You know you get into a parking complex that

50:02.300 --> 50:06.940
doesn't have a lot of parking and then all of a sudden you see oh Jackass is over the

50:06.940 --> 50:11.620
line he's taking up two spaces because his you know fucking you know Yukon or whatever

50:11.620 --> 50:16.660
is too big for a compact space. Well fuck them for trying to park in these goddamn small

50:16.660 --> 50:27.100
spaces anyways to you Rob my fu of the week goes to busyness I've been like

50:27.100 --> 50:31.260
crazy busy with all this stuff going on and I've had like zero free time

50:31.260 --> 50:35.340
especially when it comes to my work life is mostly what I'm talking about here my

50:35.340 --> 50:41.860
work life has just been nuts and F you to having this feeling because this is

50:41.860 --> 50:48.500
how I felt this is kind of a work story F you to folks that like to leave

50:48.500 --> 50:52.580
carrots on the ground and then you kind of hop up to that carrot to take a

50:52.580 --> 50:57.060
little bite and then BAM the net comes out and grabs you F you to feeling like

50:57.060 --> 51:04.020
that do I'm I'm hunting wabbits are you a furry no gross meekletov your turn I

51:04.020 --> 51:08.060
don't have an F you believe well then F you to meekletov F you to me for not

51:08.060 --> 51:12.460
having an FU of this week. How about FU to Megalotov for fucking suckering me back into

51:12.460 --> 51:18.140
Final Fantasy 11 and it's... It's awesome because I... the day that you started you're

51:18.140 --> 51:21.820
like you're not gonna get me to play this I'm like we'll see and and I didn't even have

51:21.820 --> 51:26.140
to coerce you that much and you're just like you wanted to check out how the graphics were

51:26.140 --> 51:30.540
on the 360 update and we couldn't get mine to log in so you had to log in you had to pay

51:30.540 --> 51:36.140
for it and then you just started playing and it was great. I hate you. And I'm the best.

51:36.140 --> 51:40.900
Thanks to Final Fantasy 11. Here's the game. I haven't been playing a lot of on Xbox live this week

51:40.900 --> 51:45.940
But I did get it patched because Street Fighter 2 hyper fighting got a patch earlier this week

51:46.340 --> 51:52.860
And now what they've done to the patch is that now if a person backs out of a game you get a loss

51:53.100 --> 51:57.940
But from what I'm understanding both people get a loss if you back out of the game early

51:57.940 --> 52:00.700
So that's not fair to the person who gets screwed

52:00.700 --> 52:05.380
But I guess you know it discourages people from backing out at all if someone's going to get a loss

52:05.380 --> 52:12.700
So no backing out of the game early, and I think they also address some of those timeout issues and connection things with this patch

52:12.700 --> 52:17.100
Why can't they just have another and reset the leaderboards? Why can't they just have a like?

52:17.700 --> 52:19.420
counter for disconnects

52:19.420 --> 52:24.540
Instead so you can see okay this person disconnected 500 times. Maybe I do not want to play them

52:24.540 --> 52:26.940
I mean come on and it makes sense to me

52:26.940 --> 52:34.680
I don't know what doesn't make sense, but I guess makes sense in the eyes of Microsoft. It's a stupid Toyota Yaris

52:35.320 --> 52:41.000
Game that's coming out apparently. It's gonna be some sort of adver game and has you

52:41.800 --> 52:46.400
Driving I guess the Toyota Yaris, and it's gonna coming to Xbox Live Arcade

52:47.120 --> 52:51.360
My guess it's gonna be free, but of course they haven't said yet. I

52:52.280 --> 52:55.260
Don't know. What do you guys think about you know games like this?

52:55.260 --> 53:00.100
coming out then the kind of advertise car or something like that. Will I get

53:00.100 --> 53:04.340
achievement points for playing it? Yeah, you achievement points for. Well then I think I'll be okay with that.

53:04.340 --> 53:10.020
I think it's stupid. If I'm gonna look at an advertisement, not gonna pay $60 to

53:10.020 --> 53:14.540
look at it, I'm going to go to the TV or to the movies unfortunately. You know

53:14.540 --> 53:17.700
it's bad enough that they fucking have those Yaris fucking movies that are in

53:17.700 --> 53:22.780
their official Xbox magazine. Do I really need to play an online game for that too?

53:22.780 --> 53:29.380
really why I don't know maybe if it was really customizable I'd play it but

53:29.380 --> 53:37.180
probably not it still sounds stupid all right well speculation abounds here on

53:37.180 --> 53:41.080
the internet about Windows Vista and they usually we don't talk about a lot

53:41.080 --> 53:45.580
of you know non gaming news but this is kind of relevant because you know folks

53:45.580 --> 53:49.700
do their gaming's on PC and I know we don't talk enough huh and you also have

53:49.700 --> 53:52.020
Direct X 10, which is going to be fucking awesome for gaming.

53:52.020 --> 53:55.880
Right, and I'm just saying we don't talk a lot about PC games on this show, and I apologize

53:55.880 --> 53:56.880
for that.

53:56.880 --> 53:57.880
It's just we're so busy with consoles.

53:57.880 --> 54:01.300
But we do try to talk about big things in the computer gaming world, and this would

54:01.300 --> 54:04.860
certainly be one of them, even if it is about an operating system, and it's about Windows

54:04.860 --> 54:05.860
Vista.

54:05.860 --> 54:11.120
Now, apparently, Microsoft Canada actually spilled the beans on their website about how

54:11.120 --> 54:16.120
much each tier of Windows Vista is going to cost, and this was converted to U.S. dollars

54:16.120 --> 54:21.160
from Canadians, and once you boil it down, it looks like the full version of Vista Home

54:21.160 --> 54:26.520
Basic will be $233, and Vista Ultimate will be $449.

54:26.520 --> 54:32.760
Now if you're upgrading from something previous, Vista Home Basic will be $116, Premium $179,

54:32.760 --> 54:36.540
Business $224.83, and the Ultimate $269.93.

54:36.540 --> 54:41.360
It should be noted that Microsoft Canada has since removed the listing, and they said,

54:41.360 --> 54:45.320
quote, a number of pricing models are undergoing consideration internally, however, nothing

54:45.320 --> 54:48.560
has been finalized Microsoft is currently finalizing its pricing model

54:48.560 --> 54:51.640
and we'll have more to share at a later date man I'm starting to get the

54:51.640 --> 54:56.040
impression that Microsoft Canada's kind of retarded just because of the whole

54:56.040 --> 54:58.440
you know they did the bundle thing when they weren't supposed to and all that

54:58.440 --> 55:01.080
other stuff yeah well I don't know that kind of makes them cool that they're

55:01.080 --> 55:03.600
doing stuff and they're not supposed to I don't think that makes a retard I think

55:03.600 --> 55:09.160
it makes them great I don't know whatever I think it's kind of funny so maybe it's

55:09.160 --> 55:12.240
just because I'm still having those residual I'm gonna move to Canada

55:12.240 --> 55:16.260
some day feelings because I just I love Vancouver so much what can I say whatever

55:16.260 --> 55:20.180
all right well we love you guys who choose to email us every week so much

55:20.180 --> 55:23.740
and we like to read your emails and even though dark soccer is not here this week

55:23.740 --> 55:27.180
that's not gonna prevent me from borrowing her gear and jumping into the

55:27.180 --> 55:34.580
mailbag at mailbag at orange launch radio.com email numero uno comes to us

55:34.580 --> 55:39.420
tonight from somebody from Vancouver Canada go figure actually Vancouver

55:39.420 --> 55:44.540
island there's a difference you see the island is out anyway forget it this

55:44.540 --> 55:49.920
comes to us from Wyatt dear dark Sakura sky and Loki today when I downloaded one

55:49.920 --> 55:54.220
of my favorite game podcasts I found that the longtime hosts had suddenly

55:54.220 --> 55:58.380
left the program and replaced themselves with two guys who are completely new it

55:58.380 --> 56:02.180
just wasn't the same so I switched my iPod over to Orange Lounge radio and

56:02.180 --> 56:06.660
listen thankfully to your three familiar voices the point is a podcast is only as

56:06.660 --> 56:09.280
good as the people who host it, and yours is a great one.

56:09.280 --> 56:13.380
The fact that you all know what you're doing, coupled with Loki's industry knowledge, Dark

56:13.380 --> 56:17.880
Sakura's butt-kicking-ness, whenever her car is brought up anyway, and the way that Sky

56:17.880 --> 56:30.320
is, well, is Sky, all leads to an awesome show that is well worth the three hours a

56:30.320 --> 56:32.120
week spent on listening to you guys.

56:32.120 --> 56:36.640
So Dark Sakura, here is your worshipping that you asked for, I will pass that along to her.

56:36.640 --> 56:40.440
Here's a lot for what you do for us loyal listeners, and here's for years more of the

56:40.440 --> 56:41.440
same.

56:41.440 --> 56:42.440
P.S.

56:42.440 --> 56:44.660
Sky, you should come to Canada more often.

56:44.660 --> 56:48.040
If you think that the maple syrup cookies sold on Granville Island are good, you should

56:48.040 --> 56:51.000
try the, I don't know what they're called, but basically they are maple syrup thrown

56:51.000 --> 56:55.440
into snow and then eaten like a piece of maple syrup thrown in the snow.

56:55.440 --> 56:57.160
Thanks a lot, you guys.

56:57.160 --> 56:58.740
Maybe if I come in the winter, I'll have to try that.

56:58.740 --> 56:59.740
That sounds like a winter treat.

56:59.740 --> 57:02.300
I think if I try to eat that in the summer, that might be kind of weird.

57:02.300 --> 57:04.660
But thank you very much for the email.

57:04.660 --> 57:07.840
You know, I might know which podcast you're talking about, because I keep tabs on a few

57:07.840 --> 57:11.260
that are going on, and you know, it's tough.

57:11.260 --> 57:15.640
Things change, our personal lives change, and sometimes, you know, it just affects what's

57:15.640 --> 57:16.640
going on.

57:16.640 --> 57:20.480
And as much as I would love to do Orange Lounge Radio forever, you know, there might come

57:20.480 --> 57:26.500
a time where I have to move for work, Dark Soccer has to move, Loki's got to go somewhere,

57:26.500 --> 57:29.460
you know, and we would like to think that we would keep the show going.

57:29.460 --> 57:34.360
So I applaud the other shows that try to keep on going despite the other little setbacks

57:34.360 --> 57:38.140
to go on and I want to continue to support independent radio my advice you

57:38.140 --> 57:41.440
know if it's new people that have been thrown into it give them a couple weeks

57:41.440 --> 57:45.600
to warm up because I'll tell you what this shit ain't easy I realize it seems

57:45.600 --> 57:48.880
like it's easy because you hear all these shows and you form opinions on

57:48.880 --> 57:52.840
them but the difference between like doing and listening is really really

57:52.840 --> 57:59.040
really different and trust me it raises it raises my perception of independent

57:59.040 --> 58:03.160
podcasts just so much more by doing one of my own so you know give them a chance

58:03.160 --> 58:06.500
So I bet you that same thing that you liked before will come back

58:06.500 --> 58:10.900
But if you know not we appreciate the fact that you check us out and support us and the fact that you're supporting

58:11.020 --> 58:12.540
Independent radio at all is awesome

58:12.540 --> 58:17.700
So I hope I hope things go good for you and the shows that you're listening to let's go to a new email

58:18.040 --> 58:24.720
This person did not sign their email. So I will let's see. I'll just call them Tolu because I think that's what

58:25.460 --> 58:27.460
That's what it says in the email is the first name

58:27.460 --> 58:35.180
So anyway, here's the email the subject in support of the PSP because of the uninformed bashing and Ninty fanboys

58:35.840 --> 58:38.860
We asked for emails like this. So here you go

58:39.380 --> 58:43.700
Over the last couple months the Sony bashing in the news has become almost unbearable

58:43.700 --> 58:47.780
They bash the PSP saying that it has no good games or just ports

58:47.780 --> 58:52.720
Well, the DS has just as many for example Animal Crossing new Super Mario Brothers

58:52.720 --> 58:59.180
Brothers, Castlevania, WAIT you can go outside the castle, Innovative, Metroid, etc, sorry,

58:59.180 --> 59:02.920
I want a deeper experience instead of minigames or games from 15 years ago.

59:02.920 --> 59:09.320
I like Syphon Filter, Daxter, Tekken, Metal Gear Solid, LocoRoco, Wipeout, and GTA, not

59:09.320 --> 59:10.780
Mario again.

59:10.780 --> 59:13.360
Ninty fans don't care though.

59:13.360 --> 59:14.360
There's that email.

59:14.360 --> 59:19.920
Now, I appreciate your perspective, because I think this guy does bring up a point, is

59:19.920 --> 59:23.800
that a lot of people say the PSP is the same shit over again and then run off to play the

59:23.800 --> 59:27.920
newest Mario game. Wait, he brought up another point though too. What? He's wrong. No, hold

59:27.920 --> 59:31.440
on, hold on. But I do have to say, okay, wait a minute though, because the games that you

59:31.440 --> 59:35.440
mentioned at the end there, Tekken, Metal Gear Solid, Wipeout, Grand Theft, those are

59:35.440 --> 59:40.440
all franchises too that get a new game every year, so I don't know if that's the best

59:40.440 --> 59:46.520
perspective. Hold on, hold on. Okay, now, I agree there's not a lot on the PSP, but

59:46.520 --> 59:52.520
And then again, I do own a PSP and to be honest, I play more on my PSP than I do on my DS.

59:52.520 --> 59:56.420
And he's right in most aspects, but he's also wrong in some stuff too.

59:56.420 --> 59:59.520
He's right in the fact that there are a lot of games that are just ports, I mean Super

59:59.520 --> 01:00:07.100
Mario 64 for the DS, Animal Crossing, not quite a port, more of like kind of an upgrade

01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:10.880
to the current game, but still not very different to where it's like a different game.

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:12.740
I don't know.

01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:13.740
That's different.

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:17.580
getting some exclusive games like, you know, you've got the Tony Hawk American Skate Land

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:22.020
and the new Downhill Jam that's gonna be coming out. They are getting, like, some exclusive

01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:27.460
new games and stuff. Castlevania, yeah, Castlevania is pretty much Castlevania. It is a new game.

01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:32.060
It's not a port of, like, say, Castlevania 2 or something like that. So that's new. And

01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:35.940
for long-time fans of the series, getting to go outside the castle is something new,

01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:40.860
but I get your point. Now, for the PSP, though, you have the same thing. I mean, PSP Tekken

01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:45.860
Dark Resurrection, it's a port of the arcade game, it's also a port of Tekken 5, but still

01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:50.220
it's good to have a fighting game on, you know, the PSP. Also you've got like all these

01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:55.060
collections that are coming out, like you've got the Capcom Puzzle Collection, which is,

01:00:55.060 --> 01:01:01.140
you know, ports of old games. My biggest gripe with, you know, Sony, I mean we'll get Twisted

01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:05.100
Metal head-on, which is a port of Twisted Metal 2, I mean that is a blatant port of

01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:10.560
the game, they didn't change really anything other than adding online multiplayer. But,

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:15.480
know in the same aspect I think both the laziness in portable games is really a

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:18.880
big problem because not a lot of people look at it and even Grand Theft Auto is a port of

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:24.640
just grant I mean that's a big port if it's just Grand Theft Auto 3 and now now

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:28.680
Eddie in our chat room of the oil army asked what's wrong with ports exactly

01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:33.320
that's the thing what is wrong for its people like games that are ported I was

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:37.560
hoping for a little bit better of a game you know twisted metal head-on you know

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:42.120
I wanted it to be a new game and it was just the old game all over against GS

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:47.740
68 brings up an interesting counterpoint in our chat room right there also the oil army ports render the original obsolete

01:01:47.740 --> 01:01:51.720
Not on portables because that way I can play my favorite games on the go

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:55.800
I don't need a TV or system in the car or on the train, right?

01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:59.160
But the it renders the original obsolete so what about the game on the TV?

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:03.880
It's it's a completely different experience playing the same game on TV and on the portable

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:05.880
I want to point this out to a yuri lover says

01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:12.940
Objection because there are other games that are original on the Nintendo DS and sites the following Wario ware Phoenix, right?

01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:16.020
Trauma Center Nintendogs Wario ware is not really

01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:22.360
But you get the point it is a really original game

01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:26.460
Japanese but okay, whatever whatever

01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:33.640
Okay, I'll help them out then electroplankton elite beat agents. There you go. Okay. Well if you want PSP games

01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:39.960
Um, let me try to think here luminous. I understand but look here's nothing there's enough. That's enough. Um,

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:41.480
Here's the thing

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:48.760
I've always said this the PSP is a great system if you want to do more with a handheld than just game if you want

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:51.080
To do the web music movies

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:57.160
All that crap is great on the PSP and that's really the reason to own a PSP because you want something

01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:02.380
That's a multimedia thing on the go and that's kind of where Sony's going lately, you know PlayStation 3

01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:04.100
I think it's going to be a lot of that as well.

01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:08.020
I think you're going to see in the long run from PlayStation 3, it doesn't want to be

01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:09.580
just a game system.

01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:12.540
Sony's biggest problem is that Xbox 360 doesn't want to be just a game system either, but

01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:13.540
never mind.

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:14.540
That's another day.

01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:19.580
Nintendo, on the other hand, is starting to catch up with some of that, with the Opera

01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:24.060
browser coming out and everything, but for now is really just about the games.

01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:25.060
Games, games, games.

01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:31.020
And if you want some fun, short attention span, most of the time, types of games for

01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:36.380
casual gamer Nintendo DS is where it's at. Honestly, if you're a real hardcore gamer,

01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:39.500
you ought to own both, if you can afford it. If you can't afford it, get a job.

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:43.740
And to be honest, I mean, what are people complaining about ports anyways? Because

01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:48.940
if you don't like them, don't buy them, or don't play them. And there's a lot coming out for both

01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:54.300
systems. Granted, when I look at it, I think most of it's crap, but then again, I only play one game

01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:59.900
on my PSP. So, you know, I don't really have a, you know, valid opinion on most of this stuff,

01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:03.580
But there is a lot of games that come out that I'm just not impressed with it

01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:05.360
I just like whatever ouch

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:12.060
The chat room is bringing up from various folks there that the DS has had their share of misfires such as ping pals

01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:15.140
Oh god, wrong anyone sprung was funny

01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:22.540
I'm sorry was the worst no worst video ever played my life if you play as the guy the game is hilarious

01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:26.960
I one more email. I do one more email. Whatever. This one is from DJ Tyrant

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:34.960
Hello Jamie, Rob, and Matt. Hope all is well with you. I finally have caught back up with the show now that I have moved and have cable internet at the place I'm currently living.

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:40.960
Sounds like the show is doing great like always and is very informative and actually helps me out at my work. I work at EB Games, FYI.

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:48.960
That's actually quite a compliment, thank you. I've actually heard of stores that have been playing our show over the system. I think that is crazy, but awesome. I love it. That's awesome.

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:51.860
That's awesome. That's weird. It's better than Ian Kessler.

01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:55.340
It's gotta be better than the EB Games television or whatever that crap is.

01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:58.160
Ian Kessler and Courtney Freehl. They both suck and I want to beat them up.

01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:02.800
If you work at EB Games, get our show played in there. We will send you versions that have

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:05.640
the S words and F words bleeped out if we will

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:10.480
get played in store. That's pretty hot. Anyways, the point of this email was to

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:14.640
encourage the OL army to get involved in the Beatmania US internet ranking.

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:18.000
I think it would be a great way to show Konami interest in the game and that

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.880
people did actually buy the game.

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:24.040
Currently I've only seen DrewNami and myself in the internet ranking so far, sorry if I

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:25.040
missed anyone.

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:27.080
If you could mention this on the show, that would be great.

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:31.640
Okay, so if you're a music game fan, go show your love in the Beatmania internet ranking,

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:32.640
that makes sense.

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:36.640
For the record, they did see that game as a success and it sold as many units, or it

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:41.880
outsold as many units as they thought it would, so that sounds like a good sign, we'll see.

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:46.760
Also, also I am really looking forward to the music previews for DDR Ultramix 4 and

01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:47.760
DDR Universe.

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:50.220
Sorry about the delay there.

01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:54.960
When are you going to get some music previews for In the Groove 3?

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:56.880
With a little pfft face on it.

01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:57.880
You know what?

01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:00.900
Have Rock Store give us a call, we're open.

01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:03.460
Keep up the great work and I can't wait to hear your next show.

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:07.200
Maybe sometime in the future I will see you guys again at a con or something like that,

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:10.600
as it was a disappointment to see you, only Rob I believe, for an extremely short time

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:12.880
by the Konami booth at E3 this year.

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:15.480
Anyway, stay healthy and well guys, I'm glad your show is doing so great.

01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:16.480
DJ Tyrant.

01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:18.820
Thank you very much for the email, it was very sweet.

01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:24.060
As far as other previews for other games go, we're not exclusive to, you know, we branched

01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:25.700
out of the music game thing a long time ago.

01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:29.720
We love music games, don't get us wrong, but we love all video games as well, so if any

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:34.140
company wants to do some type of premiere thing, we're down, just have them give us

01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:35.140
a call.

01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:36.140
Mailbag at orangelandrater.com.

01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:39.520
You can use that for your comments as well.

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:40.520
Talk about your game.

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:41.520
That's right.

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:45.560
We would love to get you on the show, and absolutely, yes, we've given In the Groove

01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:48.840
somewhat of a hard time on the show in the past but you know what I'm willing

01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:53.040
to give it a try and I actually I don't I don't hate in the groove I think it's

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:56.880
fine it's just it's an alternative some people like coke some people like Pepsi

01:06:56.880 --> 01:07:01.700
so it's just like coke some people like pee and some people like RC Cola for

01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:07.560
some god-awful reason. RC Cola is okay. Alright moving on please anyways well

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:17.120
Well, Scratch won one other loss for Sony, unfortunately, in their battle against Homebrew.

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:25.120
Well yes, firmware 2.8 has been hacked and now Homebrew is able, well, so far they have

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:31.400
found an exploit in 2.8 and they have Homebrew running now in every single firmware that's

01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:38.600
available from 2.0 and up and of course you know 1.5 and whatnot.

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:42.640
So that's kind of interesting and the best part about it you don't need Grand Theft Auto

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:46.040
for it to work because unfortunately with some of the other ones that's how you had

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:48.360
to do it is with Grand Theft Auto.

01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:53.600
But now they do have a Hello World proof of concept homebrew program that is available

01:07:53.600 --> 01:08:00.160
out there and yeah it's quite interesting actually because there's also was a story

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:08.400
that I read this week that they've got a downgrader now for version 2.71 to take you back down

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:14.620
to 1.5, so that's quite interesting that they've already come that far.

01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:19.480
You watch, there'll be homebrew running before you know it on every single version, and then

01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:25.720
there'll be another firmware update once the webcam and the GPS comes out.

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:28.920
How are you doing with the liquor?

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:32.020
I think I hear you starting to slur a little bit and I'm doing the same. Oh, I'm fine

01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:34.020
I'm like halfway through that

01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:39.280
The chat room pointed out to me that you can call our mailbag is something I said earlier, I guess I don't know

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:45.800
Whatever chair shut up. No, but here's the thing. Here's the thing. You don't know me. You don't know my life

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:51.760
I'm just like I'm starting to get sick of the watermelon thing. You want something new? No, I do want it

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:55.320
Yeah, you want some of the you want try this again? No, no, I don't want that stuff

01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:59.900
Especially didn't want the orange juice pussy. Yeah, I just don't like orange juice

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:03.660
Unfortunately, I've got this thing stuck in my head now where orange juice equals

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:07.380
Vomiting and so that it doesn't really it's not good drink

01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:10.260
You know what one of the first times I ever threw up I threw up

01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:15.740
Spaghetti O's and for some reason like I've never been able to able to really eat spaghetti O's the same way ever since then

01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:18.840
Well, you know what's interesting though is the first time I threw up here

01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:21.440
from over drinking was

01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:26.920
minestrone. It was homemade minestrone. But then again, that minestrone was kind of old

01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:32.240
and the sauce was a little bit fermented so it might have had something to do with it.

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:37.200
One time I threw up, though, this was pretty funny, I threw up, I know this is great chatter

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:43.340
sorry but I don't care tonight, I threw up a blue raspberry jello, which was actually

01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:50.600
not that bad. It's going down and coming up. It was kind of like, wow, kind of sweet. They

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:56.360
they should put that on the box raspberry jello great going down pretty good coming

01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:04.920
up i can see it now fuck those cream pops it's all about the

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:09.020
friends you might have to do the rest of the stories tonight how's that sound okay i'm

01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:18.700
just gonna complain so all right uh i know how's that sui coden doing what i will kill

01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:19.700
I'm just kidding.

01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:20.700
Suikoden's not that bad.

01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:21.700
It's great.

01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:22.700
It's not that great either.

01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:27.700
When are they putting out Suikoden on PSP?

01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:28.700
Huh?

01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:29.700
Oh!

01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:30.700
Oh!

01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:35.420
Well, there's this movement on an official Konami site.

01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:38.140
It's like konamigamingstars.com.

01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:44.180
It's an RPG site that Konami opened for the US fans of the Konami RPGs.

01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:48.980
And they want the fans to show how much they want this port of 1 and 2 that came out for

01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:52.220
PSP in Japan to come out over here.

01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:58.660
So I'm sure I just made up the website URL just then with the KonamiGameStars.com.

01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:04.820
But if you go there and show your support, I mean, we're really trying to get it to come

01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:05.820
out here.

01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:06.820
So...

01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:08.240
Show that it will set...

01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:11.280
Can't you talk to someone at work and make it happen?

01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:15.140
been talking for a long time about this game coming out over here he's like come

01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:20.180
on put it out on the PSP can I cover your work and and berate people cuz

01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:25.540
obviously that's fine kind of people drink from what I've learned previously

01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:29.940
at their barbecue yeah so I can go with just drunkenly berate people into

01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:33.580

I fucking own everybody. Alright, um...

01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:13.400
Oh, uh, Eddie would like to point out his Konami RPG stars, by the way.

01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:17.120
What did I say? I don't know. I think I said something close to that. You're not even drunk! What's your excuse?

01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:20.800
I'm stupid. That's pretty much my excuse.

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:26.240
Yeah, yeah, you are. Okay, look. Trying to get through this segment in under two hours, please.

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:29.560
Uh, moving on, you know, because we don't want to get any more. Alright, alright, let's go, go.

01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:34.240
We don't need any angry iTunes reviews this week. This show is too fucking long.

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:37.280
I don't want to download this show because it's too long.

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:39.720
I like my new short, nyeh, nyeh, nyeh, nyeh.

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:40.720
Well then, you know what?

01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:41.720
Turn on G4.

01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:44.280
You'll get about two minutes of game news in an entire 24-hour period, okay?

01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:50.720
And then Star Trek.

01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:55.160
This month's PlayStation Magazine has a scoop on the new PSP model.

01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:58.640
Apparently the unit features 8GB of flash memory built in.

01:12:58.640 --> 01:12:59.840
Wow!

01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:03.920
On top of that, there's a video camera still being planned but no hard drive.

01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:10.520
Seem to recall there was something I read later in the week where Sony said no lies. It's all lies. It's not happening

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:16.240
What's that the official PlayStation magazine or PSM? I think it was official PlayStation magazine. Hell's wrong these official

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:22.400
Let's just make up news. Who cares? It'll give the PSP more Oh

01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:28.480
Attention fuck chatroom pointed out. I said something that was banned last week g4

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:32.400
I'm not banned, I say whatever I want Yes, but you're not drunk, I can use that

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:33.400
as an excuse.

01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:34.400
Sorry.

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:35.400
Bad Rod!

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:37.400
But I made fun of him, so it's okay.

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:41.680
No, I still think it's a borderland, so let it happen again.

01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:43.760
By the way though, I'm sorry.

01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:48.800
By the way, I do gotta mention they are remaking the original Star Trek series.

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:52.080
They're redoing all the CG effects in it, so you know that'll be playing on a certain

01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:53.080
channel soon.

01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:54.080
Anyways, uh...

01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:55.080
Yay!

01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:56.080
Anyways...

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:57.080
A little quieter.

01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:04.080
little quieter. The PlayStation 3, there's news, actually from the Inquirer, which I'm

01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:09.720
sure is a great source of game news, that the RSX chip in the PlayStation 3, which it

01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:16.720
originally was set to run at 550, 700 core memory, has been realigned with the expectations

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:23.640
has been realigned with the expectations that the value will be dropped to 506.50 in other

01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:27.800
words being throttled down.

01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:30.220
And what's that supposed to mean to you?

01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:34.000
Probably nothing because I don't know it's not supposed to have a big effect on the games

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:38.080
but it's kind of like the Playstation Portable because their chip can run at 333 but it only

01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:43.760
runs at 222 to save battery power but my guess is probably this thing is overheating.

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:47.600
so that's probably why they throttled it down.

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:49.520
Great, you know, maybe later on down the line

01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:50.940
they can use the full potential of the chip

01:14:50.940 --> 01:14:54.460
and, I don't know, with some software updates.

01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:57.620
So, hooray, more news.

01:14:57.620 --> 01:15:00.420
The slogan for the PlayStation 3 ad campaign

01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:04.060
has been revealed and it's called This Is Living.

01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:05.700
That is the new catchphrase you're gonna hear,

01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:07.100
at least in Europe, I believe,

01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:07.940
but I think they're gonna use that

01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:08.840
in the rest of the world.

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:09.680
Let's hope not.

01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:11.300
But if you take that last story into account,

01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:13.220
I think the tagline should have been This Is Burning.

01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:16.300
I don't think, I think they already have a catch phrase here in the US.

01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:18.900
It's called, we used the Spider-Man logo.

01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:19.900
Play Beyond?

01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:21.060
Yeah, Play Beyond.

01:15:21.060 --> 01:15:22.060
I think.

01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:23.500
Well, I don't know, somewhere else they're calling it.

01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:25.640
This is living.

01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:36.740
This is living in poverty because they spent all my money on a PlayStation 3, hurrah.

01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:37.740
This is welfare.

01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:42.260
Well, anyways, what's kind of cool about the PlayStation 3 is, well, Fight Night Round 3

01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:45.620
coming to it, and it will have some interesting new stuff.

01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:49.740
It will have a get in the ring first person mode, which will be kind of like punch out

01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:50.740
I guess.

01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:54.820
What's also interesting though is the screenshots actually look better than the 360 version,

01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:59.220
but then again I haven't seen the 360 version in a while so I couldn't really say, but it

01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:00.220
looks better.

01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:02.820
I don't know, that's just me.

01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:07.820
But then again, you know, I thought that Motorstorm looked pretty good when I originally saw the

01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:11.780
screenshots and then I played it and it sucked, so I don't know.

01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:19.620
Loki said this is crappy this is awful this joke needs to die

01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:25.820
Rayman of course is coming to the Wii in the form of Rayman raving rabbits and

01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:30.080
somehow the rumor got started that this game was going to be Wii exclusive

01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:34.020
although I never heard that in my life but needless to say it was picked up

01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:39.780
earlier this week that Rayman is not going to be Wii exclusive now I don't

01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:43.060
know there's all this confusion going on at Ubisoft because you know is Assassin's

01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:47.540
Creed exclusive and blah blah blah supposedly it's supposed to hit more

01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:51.620
next-gen systems next year Assassin's Creed though is definitely

01:16:51.620 --> 01:16:56.220
multi-platform you know PC PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 so why the hell shouldn't

01:16:56.220 --> 01:17:00.420
Rayman be multi-platform. According to Ubisoft I even asked them this no it's not

01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:05.060
exclusive and it will be coming out. Now the Wii version is gonna be

01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:09.620
exclusive to the Wii obviously because it has a different control system that's

01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:10.620
That's about it.

01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:12.900
That's the only thing exclusive about it.

01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:15.940
It is one of their launch titles through the Wii that they're really looking forward to,

01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:20.420
but it is most definitely not exclusive and will be out on pretty much all the systems

01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:23.820
from what I was reading, you know, from their lineup.

01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:30.500
And all about at the same time, so, sorry, not exclusive, oh well.

01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:36.940
Anyways, kind of on a little bit different subject here, Minnesota has decided to appeal

01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:44.380
the court decision that overturned their game law calling it unconstitutional and not too

01:17:44.380 --> 01:17:46.460
surprising.

01:17:46.460 --> 01:17:54.340
And what's interesting though, according to the Minnesota Attorney General Mike Hatch,

01:17:54.340 --> 01:17:58.380
his reason for appealing is what the act really does is make sure the parents are involved

01:17:58.380 --> 01:18:03.740
in the decisions of whether their children should play violent or sexually explicit video

01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:04.740
games.

01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:08.820
I agree with him in that statement because parents should be involved in what their kids

01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:09.820
play.

01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:14.260
However, I don't think the law should really do much as restricting people because I think

01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:15.820
it should really be up to the parents.

01:18:15.820 --> 01:18:20.460
Anyways, the law simply prohibits children 16 years old and younger from buying those

01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:21.460
types of games.

01:18:21.460 --> 01:18:26.260
If the parents aren't troubled by their kids playing these games, they can buy them for

01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:27.260
their children.

01:18:27.260 --> 01:18:32.820
But that still doesn't make any sense because what if these, say for example, little Billy

01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:38.020
Billy's at his school or whatever and has this maturity game in his backpack where he

01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:39.020
gets caught by the police.

01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:43.520
Now is that going to be treated the same way like say if they found cigarettes in his bag

01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:44.520
or something like that?

01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:47.980
Is possession of the video game actually part of this law?

01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:50.900
Or is it the sales of the video game?

01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:55.540
Which is stupid because then that would be almost like saying, yeah it's illegal to sell

01:18:55.540 --> 01:19:00.020
alcohol to a minor but if your mom buys it for you, it's okay if you drink it.

01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:02.580
That's kind of the way that they're phrasing this.

01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:07.420
Which makes this law even more retarded, which there's no reason for the law anyways.

01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:09.700
Drunami in our chat room says, Enough is enough!

01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:14.100
I'm not sure if he's talking about what you're saying or all the incessant snakes on a plane

01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:16.620
jokes that are still going on in chat room.

01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:17.620
It's so annoying.

01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:20.180
You know how I watched that movie this week?

01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:21.180
Lame!

01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:22.180
Okay.

01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:27.820
Yeah, Mac Man says, Here's the pop culture reference of the year.

01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:30.660
Insert animal here on a insert form of transportation.

01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:31.660
Mad Libs!

01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:32.660
She's on a dog.

01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:40.100
Anyway, if you want to join in the craziness that is our chat room, just head on over to

01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:44.860
www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on chat.

01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:47.940
All right, I guess that's going to do it for part A of our podcast.

01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:51.140
We're going to take a little bit of a break, and we're going to come right back with more

01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:56.380
of Orange Lounge Radio to come in part B. Tonight, in part B of our program, Beat the

01:19:56.380 --> 01:19:57.380
Host.

01:19:57.380 --> 01:19:58.380
Huzzah!

01:19:58.380 --> 01:20:02.340
Don't beat the host is coming back for part B. I gotta make sure I write down my

01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:06.980
Game if you get challenged they might go for the sober challenge to go from eglatov, right?

01:20:06.980 --> 01:20:11.100
I remember the last time we played this he got a shitty score, so he'd be easy like three

01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:16.780
So we'll see we'll see what happens tonight all coming up in orange lounge radio part B. I could be three

01:20:17.740 --> 01:20:19.740
right now

01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:26.140
Maybe orange lounge radio is taped live on Sunday nights and it's podcast to the world twice a week

01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:31.060
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
