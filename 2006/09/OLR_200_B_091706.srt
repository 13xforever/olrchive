Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on this lovely Sunday evening, September the 17th of 2006.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It is our 200th episode tonight, so it's a little bit crazy, but that's alright.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What else can we do here to celebrate of our 200th episode?

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We have a little cake during the break.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Thank you, Chris, for bringing the chocolate cake.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm filled with chocolatey goodness now. It's great.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
But we're going to get back into what we do well here.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It is some gaming news.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Loki, start us off.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yes, and as we talked about in Part A about the Wii being region-free or not being region-free, we still don't know.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
There is rumors that the PlayStation 3 may be region-free, and there might be confirmation on that.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
According to a Resistance Fall of Man video interview posted on GameVideos, the PlayStation 3 may indeed be region-free.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And basically the kind of proof for that is that they're talking about multiple versions of the game,

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
all the videos being put in there in both the high-def formats, including PAL, on one disc.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So people are kind of assuming, okay, so there's going to be one run of the game that's going to be throughout the world.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So maybe kind of some proof that there might be some region-free games.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I think, if anything, it's going to be like the 360, whereas some games are region-free.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
If the developers want them, some games aren't.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I think that's probably what you're going to see.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Interesting. I don't know. I would hope that the PS3 would be region-free,

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
but that would be kind of a new thing for Sony, because PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 1 definitely weren't.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But PlayStation 1 was pretty easy to get around it.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
PlayStation 2 took a little while, but now you can get around it.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But I have a Japanese PlayStation 2 just because I had to have those imports,

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and I did not want to fuck up my original PlayStation 2.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I have a first-model JPS2. It still works, actually.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But there's no way I'm getting a JPS3. Too much money.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'll just have to wait. Forget the imports. I'll just have to live without it.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Anyway, another thing people have been curious about PlayStation 3 is what is really their answer to Xbox Live.

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
One interesting piece of speculation came up this week.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
XFire, a possible team-up with the popular PC messaging program XFire.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm an XFire user, and I think it's awesome, because I could be playing World of Warcraft

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and message somebody who's playing Call of Duty or something else a completely different game.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I think the concept behind XFire is awesome.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Even if MTV does own it, it doesn't matter. I think it's a great system.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I would be very excited to see something like this come to PlayStation 3.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
There was a quote this week.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I believe it was 1UP reporting from a transcript of Viacom's report.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Quote, importantly, XFire just signed a deal with Sony to create a version of their platform for the new PlayStation 3,

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
which will now enable XFire to extend its reach further into the huge console gaming market.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And they're saying that Untold Legends Dark Kingdom, which was a PS3 launch exclusive,

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
was in XFire's PC initialization file.

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Now, after this story sat on the Internet for a couple days before you folks in the chat room start yelling at us

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
and telling us, you know, wait a minute, wait a minute.

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yes, we do know little news came out a little later that says,

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
actually, Sony doesn't plan to be fully integrating XFire right here.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
This was just for this one game.

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But you know what? I still find this partnership to be very interesting nonetheless.

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What do you guys think? I mean, Loki, you know a lot about XFire. Do you use it at all?

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Nope.

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Oh, well then, what do you think about teaming up with the PC based?

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Well, might as well, since Sony doesn't seem to know what the, you know, their ass from their foot as far as online, you know, services go.

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Well, how do you know they don't have something already and they just haven't said anything yet?

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Because their whole answer is like, yes, our services will be exactly what Xbox Live is.

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So, you know, since they can't really innovate on that, I guess.

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I don't know. They haven't really said anything about it and the fact that there's a lack of information about what they're providing on their online service makes me think, hmm,

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
they don't know what they're providing on their online service yet.

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
They don't have a plan whatsoever.

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So I'm sure, you know, we're going to hear more about their online service and about their games at Tokyo Game Show in a few weeks.

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
But until then, I don't think they know shit about their online service right now.

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And I think it's just kind of pieced together.

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And I think you just said what exactly is going to prove your statement wrong, Tokyo Game Show.

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I think our answers are, we're going to get the answers to our questions there.

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Well, until then, I still think that they, their online services very pieced together and I don't know.

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It doesn't sound very good so far.

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Jamie, any thoughts from you?

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I know you don't really do a lot of PC gaming, but...

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I have AIM.

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Well, X-Fire's kind of like it in a way.

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I have AIM.

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What if PlayStation 3 had AIM on it? Would that be cool?

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I probably wouldn't use it on there because I'd be too busy playing a game.

76
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Ooh.

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
All right. Good thought, I guess.

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Anyways, yeah.

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So, speaking of the PlayStation 3, we know that they're, of course, coming out with two different versions of the PlayStation 3,

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
a premium and I guess a core version, you know, if you want to use the Xbox 360 analogy.

81
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The rumored ratio of these is supposed to be 80% of the premium, 20% core because, you know, they really want to push that, you know, $600 model.

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So, you're going to be seeing most of these coming out, you know, in the more expensive bundle,

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
but I think a lot of people are going to be getting the more expensive one anyway.

84
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's kind of like how with the Xbox 360, sure, they had the core one available, but people only bought it because the premium was sold out.

85
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So, I guess that's their way of making more money off of this or losing less money, I guess.

86
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Well, I was kind of bitter when the only Xbox 360 I could get was a core because they were making, like, it seemed like half and half.

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So, I think they know the more people want the premiums because the cores are kind of a joke, just like they were a 360 in my opinion.

88
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And to be honest, there's going to be shortages because they're only going to have, you know, what, 400,000 units to launch with the United States or North America.

89
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Well, I ain't buying one until at least 2007, so there you go.

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You know what, at least with the Wii, you know, they're promising 4 million units by the end of the year, most of which are coming to the United States.

91
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Well, I hope they make good on that or else, you know, it better not be the 360 all over again. So, we'll see.

92
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Well, in other news, this actually has to do with the Xbox 360 and some UK news.

93
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:51,000
There is going to be a free week of Xbox Live for our friends overseas.

94
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's stating that you'll actually be able to use the services starting on 20th November.

95
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Hey!

96
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
That's a different song.

97
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Excuse me. I'll ferret you.

98
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's not my fault you can't tell your September from your November, okay?

99
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm going to throw my hat at you.

100
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
If only Nintendo would make that mistake.

101
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Back to the news. On the 20th September, Xbox Live will be free to our friends in Europe.

102
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Free access. And it ends on the 29th.

103
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Actually, it will be at 11.59pm. I think that's UK time.

104
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So, get in all that laggy, scramble Xbox Live action while you can because I played it online and it's laggy.

105
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Well, some of the games are available right now just to give a list.

106
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Project Gotham Racing 3, Top Spin, 2, Table Tennis, Saints Row, World Cup Soccer, Dark Zero.

107
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm sorry, Perfect Dark Zero, Street Fighter 2, Hyper Fighting Edition, Texas Hold'em.

108
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Hey, you know what? Log on and play Uno with us.

109
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Maybe we could do it. That would be a good way for us to meet some UK listeners except one of us is going to have to be awake at a god-awful hour for that to happen.

110
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Unless we do it on a weekend.

111
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Give it a weekend.

112
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
No, we could be up at like 11am. They could be at 7 o'clock at night or something.

113
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
With the vision camera.

114
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Oh yeah, that's right. We're going to have a vision camera soon, so that would be fun.

115
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
We could moon our UK listeners. Wouldn't that be exciting?

116
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
No.

117
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
No, I'm sure they'd love that.

118
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,000
We'll have to learn what the proper root gestures are in British English.

119
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Anyways, speaking of lame ideas, you know, rare.

120
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Rare, of course, was responsible for a lot of the launch titles, or a couple of launch titles, I should say, for the Xbox 360.

121
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Actually, no, I take that back. There's only one title.

122
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Anyways, they had a launch title for the 360, Perfect Dark Zero.

123
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And now, of course, I'm going to be announcing some more titles at X06, which is later this month.

124
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Including, well, some thoughts at least.

125
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Banjo 3 or Killer Instinct are some of the thoughts that may be the announcement.

126
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I think it's probably a new IP.

127
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Or maybe a Perfect Dark where you can jump.

128
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
That'd be nice.

129
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,000
But anyways, more news to come, of course, once X06 takes place in Barcelona.

130
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So, look forward to that.

131
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Now they're all cursing each other in UNO speak in our chat room.

132
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
We're cursing each other in British English.

133
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Draw four, bitch.

134
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
No, a little bit different.

135
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Black Wolf is saying, skip four, you tit.

136
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And he also said, draw four, you bloody bloke.

137
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
That was my worst British accent ever, by the way.

138
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Sorry, I won't do that again.

139
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Sorry, UK folks. I apologize.

140
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I apologize to the entire United Kingdom.

141
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Oh, that's right.

142
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I knew it was a couple, and I have to go and correct myself again.

143
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Moving on to another story.

144
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Final Fantasy XII, something about the current gen systems.

145
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I know we've had a lot of next gen news, but something about the current gen systems.

146
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
They're actually going to be having a whole day to celebrate Final Fantasy XII in New York City.

147
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And what's going on is that on October 12th through October 15th at the Digital Life Expo,

148
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Final Fantasy XII will be appearing at the event.

149
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Very cool, and I know we have a lot of fans there at New York City that want to check that out.

150
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
However, here's the other part you should check out.

151
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
October 11th is Final Fantasy XII day, and that has been declared by New York City.

152
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
There will be a special commemoration in Times Square.

153
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Cosplayers will be abounding, I'm sure.

154
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I don't see why people are making such a big deal out of something that's such a crap game.

155
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You haven't even played it yet, have you?

156
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Yes, I have.

157
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's incredible.

158
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The demo?

159
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's going to be incredible.

160
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I know. I want to play my game by myself.

161
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Well, we'll just see when the full version comes out.

162
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
We will just see.

163
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm still going to get it.

164
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yes, you see, fangirl.

165
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm using Megzi's excuse.

166
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Metal box.

167
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Special edition.

168
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Oh, special stuff.

169
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Alright.

170
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Anyway.

171
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Well, one thing that I think a lot of us will be happy about, especially a certain somebody sitting by my foot,

172
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
is Kingdom Hearts 2 is getting an international version in Japan.

173
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
We're getting Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix,

174
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
which a couple of us who pay attention to our live journals have seen pictures of because somebody posted

175
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:10,000
a scan from a magazine of a certain somebody who was in a mask in the bonus clip for Kingdom Hearts 2.

176
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Oh, so this game will actually have an ending that makes sense?

177
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It made sense.

178
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm just messing.

179
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
But from what that picture indicated, it's going to give us more of that little clip because

180
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I don't care if I'm spoiling now, but if you get the perfect ending for Kingdom Hearts 2,

181
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
you get a little clip of three armored figures picking up key blades.

182
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
YouTube is amazing.

183
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And there are, there's like a bajillion other key blades, like a graveyard around them.

184
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And apparently they're going to have more of that in the ending.

185
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You know how there was the deep dive in the last Kingdom Hearts.

186
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
But they're also saying that they're going to be incorporating the card battle,

187
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
the card battle system from Chain of Memories.

188
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It didn't give a lot of detail.

189
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Again, I saw the ad for this.

190
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I've seen the article.

191
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
They showed it like, they actually showed, I think, the Sephiroth battle on this picture.

192
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And I'll have to find out who it was on my friends list that posted the article.

193
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:18,000
But it had the little card icons in the side and you draw your cards and play them out like Chain of Memories.

194
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
But it looked really neat.

195
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Another point is that they are getting all the English voices.

196
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So, hey, importers, be happy.

197
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You, too, can own this game and play it in an understandable language.

198
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Unless you are fluent in Japanese and then you won't have a problem anyway.

199
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Yay, Japanese.

200
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Anyways, speaking of stuff coming out in Japan, well, this is more, of course, for the U.S.

201
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
We have some release dates for you, including the stuff that's coming out this week.

202
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And lots of good stuff, of course.

203
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
My favorites being on the PlayStation 2.

204
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Okami is going to be finally making its way out here, you know, very anticipated.

205
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's about fucking time.

206
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Exactly.

207
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
We're also going to be getting...

208
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I will talk with my mouth full whenever I want.

209
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I am one of the hosts of this podcast, goddammit.

210
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Okie dokie.

211
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Sorry, I was yelling at Chris for trying to be my mommy.

212
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Ok.

213
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
No, we're going to be getting some other stuff, including, well, some stuff for the Game Boy

214
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Advance.

215
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Bratz Forever Diamonds, which is also actually...

216
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Actually, I take that back.

217
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's not coming out in the Game Boy Advance that week.

218
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
That would be in October.

219
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
This is incorrect.

220
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Red Rescue Team and also Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Blue Rescue Team,

221
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
which is coming out in the DS will be making their way this week.

222
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Open Seasons, pretty much on every single console, including the 360.

223
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Why you would buy that one, I don't know.

224
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Dragon Quest Heroes Rocket Slime is going to be making its way to the DS, which is pretty

225
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
awesome.

226
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
If you're a fan of Sierra games, there's going to be some PC compilations coming out for

227
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
you, including the King's Quest compilation, Leisure Suit Larry compilation, Police Quest,

228
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Space Quest, and yeah, those would be the compilations for you.

229
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Hot!

230
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,760
Samurai Warriors 2 on the 360 and PlayStation 2 are going to be coming out.

231
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,200
If you have some stuff for the 360, you're looking to pick up some games, well, The Godfather

232
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,160
is going to be coming out for you, as well as, well, not really a game, but the Xbox

233
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,360
Live Vision camera, as we mentioned earlier.

234
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,360
Let's see here.

235
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:34,440
World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions, which is also on PSP and PlayStation 2.

236
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,440
I might pick this up because it looks funny.

237
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:45,400
Cabela's Alaskan Adventure, all that ice fishing and hunting polar bears on HD there.

238
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,480
And then, no Africa on the ice, okay.

239
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:55,040
And then finally, on the Game Boy Advance Capcom Classics mini-mix will be making its

240
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,240
way out there.

241
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,920
And if you really buy everything for the Game Boy Advance, Fashion Dogs, where you can dress

242
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,600
up dogs on the Game Boy Advance.

243
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,560
There are people who do that for real, though, that's sad.

244
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,200
And if you're one of those people, never mind.

245
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,160
Please stop listening to OLR.

246
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,960
Oh, King of Fighters 2006, I'm sorry, was also making its way in Godfather Mob Wars.

247
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,960
Much better.

248
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:23,920
Well, as for our friends overseas in Europe, by the way, Suikoden 5 came out yesterday,

249
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,920
so get it.

250
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:30,180
But on the 21st, Jaws Unleashed, yay.

251
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:34,400
And then on the 22nd, FIFA 07 is coming out for everything.

252
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,400
And I'm not kidding.

253
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:40,120
FIFA is coming out for damn near everything, including, you know, Nintendo Virtual Boy.

254
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,120
I'm kidding.

255
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,720
I have a Virtual Boy.

256
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,400
How can you still play your Virtual Boy?

257
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,880
Isn't that just the biggest migraine maker ever?

258
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,400
And I like it.

259
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,160
I still play Teleroboxer, damn it.

260
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,160
Freak.

261
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:03,200
Anyway, also coming out is Guilty Gear Dust Strikers for the DS.

262
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,720
Jaws Unleashed on the Xbox, which I don't know why it's not coming out on the 21st with

263
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,600
the other versions.

264
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:17,680
Just Cause on Xbox 360, NHL Eastside Hockey Manager 2007 on PC, PyroWorld on PC, and Saint

265
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,000
Seiya the Hades on PlayStation 2.

266
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,400
I'm glad you get it as Saint Seiya, not as, like, Warriors of the Zodiac, which is stupid.

267
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,400
All right.

268
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,720
Well, let's take a look at some release dates coming to Japan.

269
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,740
September 19th, you're getting Chaos Wars.

270
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:38,800
And then September 21st, you're getting an RPG made by Koei for the PlayStation 2 called

271
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:43,000
Harukanaro Jiku no Kare Mai Ichiya.

272
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,300
And then you're also getting NHL 06 and Rugby 06 coming out from Electronic Arts over there

273
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,520
in Japan.

274
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,960
And something I thought was very interesting also coming out on the 21st, the Game Center

275
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,840
of USA Midway Arcade Treasures.

276
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,240
Yes, this is a version.

277
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:02,400
It's a port of Midway Arcade Treasures Volume 1, it looks like, coming out on the PlayStation

278
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,440
2 translated into Japanese.

279
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,400
So I guess it's a way for them to play some of the games that were really big here in

280
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,720
America years ago.

281
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,480
So that's kind of neat to see a four-year-old game getting translated for a Japanese audience.

282
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,920
I think a lot of them were already out in Japan, though.

283
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,920
Probably.

284
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,920
Well, yeah.

285
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,920
Especially in arcade format.

286
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,320
But some of the games, I kind of see, because not all the games that were popular here were

287
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,720
popular there and so on.

288
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,760
Like I imagine Mortal Kombat was probably bigger here than it was there.

289
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,760
I don't know.

290
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,360
I mean, I wasn't in Japan in the mid-90s, so I don't know.

291
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,520
But that's what you have to look forward to this week.

292
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,520
Hmm.

293
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,520
Excellent.

294
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,420
Anyways, speaking of stuff that we could be looking forward to, SNK is actually trying

295
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:44,840
to make a comeback in the arcades with brand new hardware.

296
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,840
And they're going to be showing...

297
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,840
Wait a minute, though.

298
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,840
Wait a minute, though.

299
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,640
Remember when they tried the 64?

300
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,360
When have you ever seen an SNK machine at an arcade?

301
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:59,720
I always see these SNK machines at frickin' pizza parlors, and I saw one at the supermarket

302
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,840
and one at Jim Boy's Tacos, okay?

303
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,120
We had a six-slot MVS at my arcade.

304
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,000
Those SNK machines show up in the craziest fuckin' places.

305
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,160
And we had one of the big-screen TV ones for Samurai Shadow 3.

306
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,160
I saw one in a 7-Eleven.

307
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,240
However, Samurai Shadow 4 has a signal that resets those TVs.

308
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,240
It turns them off.

309
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,240
I'm sorry.

310
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,640
Did you have a story?

311
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:27,800
At the 44th amusement machine show in Japan, they were showing off...

312
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:32,240
Actually they were supporting Taito's new Type-X2 arcade board, so it's actually not

313
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,200
even SNK's board.

314
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,580
Way to go.

315
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:42,560
So they're going to be putting out some brand new games, including King of Fire's Maximum

316
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:47,880
Impact Regulation A and Samurai Spirit Sen.

317
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:54,880
Regulation A is actually based on the 3D home console fighting series by the same name,

318
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,000
and at least includes one new character, Ash Crimson.

319
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,120
Wow, Ash Crimson is such a generic sounding name.

320
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:09,760
Anyways, he's from King of Fire's O3 and King of Fire's Eleven.

321
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,680
Samurai Spirit Sen also play as a 3D game.

322
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:17,200
This will be the second time the sword fighting series has made its way in the arcade in 3D

323
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,240
since it landed on the Hyper-Neo Geo 64.

324
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:26,240
And I have a little one that remembers King of Fighter's 64.

325
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,840
The only good thing about that game was bringing in, what's your name, that had the two swords?

326
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,840
Psycho Girl.

327
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,760
I guess he has a big fat math for me, I've never been huge on SNK.

328
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:41,960
They announced that they're going to be releasing King of Fighter's 12 on the new hardware 2.

329
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,680
Goddamn, make a new game, SNK!

330
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,320
Make a new fucking game!

331
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,800
Give us Godot, Mark of the Wolves 2, give us Last Blade 3.

332
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,800
Give us a new game!

333
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,800
Give us a new series game!

334
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,800
Give us Last Blade 3, please!

335
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,800
Oh god, I'm done.

336
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,800
Oh my god, I love Last Blade 3.

337
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:01,600
Rob, aren't you looking forward to the Metal Slug anthology that's going to be on the

338
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,600
Wii?

339
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,600
I can't wait to play Metal Slug 413, which is like the same graphics for Metal Slug 1.

340
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,080
I could play Metal Slug all day, because it's all about fighting.

341
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:14,140
Okay, and King of Fighter's 2011, you know, granted Metal Slug is pretty awesome, but

342
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:19,320
you know what, it's pretty awesome like 10 years ago, okay, now, whereas, they really

343
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,680
need to make some different games, you know.

344
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:28,800
Don't get me wrong, I mean, SNK is cool and all, you know, Bust a Move or Puzzle Bobble,

345
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:34,640
whatever the hell you want to call it, but seriously, SNK, new fighting games, new Metal

346
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,640
Slug something.

347
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,640
Wait, wait, wait, that wasn't SNK.

348
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,640
What?

349
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,240
Oh, I keep, that was on all the freaking machines, wasn't it?

350
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,240
On all their machines.

351
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,240
We're playing more SNK now.

352
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,240
Sure.

353
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,440
But, why are they porting a shitty game like Maximum Impact?

354
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,960
We didn't like it here in America, they didn't like it there in Japan.

355
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,120
The voiceovers suck.

356
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,480
Port a decent game to arcades.

357
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:05,480
Well, as far as hopefully, and I would hope with 573 titles, something good will have

358
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,480
to be among them.

359
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,480
I'm sorry, was that 573 titles?

360
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,480
573?

361
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,480
Hmm, funny.

362
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,480
Tokyo Game Show.

363
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:19,040
It will be on display, it's actually listed up there on their website.

364
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,320
And Jamie's going to read all 573 games on display right now.

365
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,200
The hell I am.

366
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,380
Last year's total was 516, so they were going to type it, I guess next year's going to be

367
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,800
600 something?

368
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,800
I have a prediction.

369
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,560
How can you, that many freaking games?

370
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,520
E3 probably has more.

371
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,620
Konami will own Tokyo Game Show.

372
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:43,000
And I'm wondering, when are we going to get WTF?

373
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Didn't they change the name of that?

374
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
They did.

375
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,320
They changed it and they changed it back.

376
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,320
Good for them.

377
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,320
WTF is coming out in October.

378
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,320
Good.

379
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,320
Book time fun.

380
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,320
Good for them.

381
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,600
But, there are actually, you know, a lot of games for PC, mobile phone games.

382
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,960
They're actually saying for PC and mobile phone, they had 252 titles.

383
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:09,000
For portables, DS will be bringing 52, PSP will have 33, 18 PS3 games are going to show

384
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,720
and they'll probably all still suck and play on Rock Mountain servers.

385
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,760
And 20 games coming out for Xbox 360, but they're only showing 5 for the Wii.

386
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,120
Wii is holding out.

387
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:31,560
The ones that they are actually going to be putting on is The Bleach Game, Shiraha Kirameku

388
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:39,320
Marvelous Interactives, Bokujo Monogatari Wii, which is still a working title, and Elibits.

389
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,880
They don't say if it's going to be playable or not.

390
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,000
And actually, they do list a lot of the games.

391
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,880
Well, they can go look on the web if they want to see that whole list.

392
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:55,200
Yeah, though there is a Gundam game coming out on Xbox 360, which sounds kind of cool.

393
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,160
It just says Gundam Operation Troy.

394
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,280
I'm not sure if this is one of the games they're going to show at Tokyo Game Show.

395
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,160
Bully, I don't know if that's going to be a big game in Japan, who knows.

396
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:10,680
But Bully got an official rating this week from the ESRB and this kind of surprised me.

397
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,640
Despite all the controversy that's going around, it's being rated T for Teen.

398
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,920
Not M for Mature, but T for Teen.

399
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:22,320
And the reason why it's been rated this way is crude humor, violence, sexual themes, language,

400
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,760
and use of alcohol and tobacco earned this game a T rating.

401
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,040
Now what's kind of interesting about this is that it seems like the expectations for

402
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:35,880
the game here might be kind of low, because it is a current gen game, and PS2 is kind

403
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,080
of winding down a little bit.

404
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,480
So it seems like, despite all this controversy and everything, people are kind of setting

405
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,480
themselves up for disappointment.

406
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,480
I don't know.

407
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,480
What do you think?

408
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,480
Look, you've been following Bully a little more than I have.

409
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,600
Do you think this game is going to sell awesome, or do you think most people have moved on

410
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,240
to Saints Row on the 360?

411
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,480
I would have liked to see it mature rated, but of course I understand why they're doing

412
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,560
it so they can sell more.

413
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,640
It's been delayed forever, and to be honest, some of the other Rockstar games not Grand

414
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,880
Theft Auto have been pretty good.

415
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,880
I mean, Warriors was pretty fun for a while, and then I got bored with it.

416
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,440
But Bully looks pretty fun, and they've got a really good system for all the classes and

417
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,880
stuff that you have to take.

418
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,000
A lot of minigames and stuff involved in that, so I think it'll be pretty good if you give

419
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
it a chance.

420
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I don't know.

421
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,680
I just have to wait until it comes out, I guess.

422
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,080
Act Death in our chat room says, Jack Thompson will sue.

423
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,080
Jack Thompson's stupid.

424
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,880
It doesn't have anything to do with, you know, great.

425
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,520
So he's going to complain about this game.

426
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,520
Play the damn game.

427
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,520
You'll see that there's nothing.

428
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,680
I don't even think it has much to do with bullying people, to be honest, if you actually

429
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,680
play the game.

430
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,160
O.L. Army Eddie says, sexual themes?

431
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,200
Usually that's an automatic M.

432
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,200
Well, interesting.

433
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,200
Not necessarily.

434
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,360
It could just be a chick dancing in her bra or something.

435
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,880
That might not be M, but it might be a little bit, you know.

436
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,440
Not to bring this up again, but they have sexual themes in The Sims 2.

437
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,640
And that's rated T. Yeah, it has woohoo.

438
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,120
Especially if you get the special furniture with the sex animations.

439
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,200
Yeah, woohoo in, I think, on the couch.

440
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,960
Woohoo in the bed, woohoo in the hot tub, and then something else.

441
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,960
Woohoo indeed.

442
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,440
They should have been, Nintendo should have come out.

443
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:16,080
The old Sims, the first Sims game actually had someone programmed a countertop that you

444
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,720
could woohoo on with full animations.

445
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,720
Wow.

446
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,720
Okay.

447
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,720
Woohoo indeed.

448
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,720
But hey, online content may change.

449
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,720
Anyways.

450
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:31,840
So, speaking about, you know, some stuff that people think that games like Bully Cause.

451
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:38,320
Well, there was a shooter in Montreal that went and killed a bunch of people at his school,

452
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,440
and guess what they found as one of his favorite games.

453
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:47,020
Apparently this guy plays a lot of games, including one that happens to be Super Column

454
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,920
by Massacre RPG.

455
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:54,320
You know, not the sequel to Super Mario RPG, just to clear that up for you.

456
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,320
But uh.

457
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,480
Thanks, I wasn't sure.

458
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,140
But anyways, yeah, so apparently they're saying, oh, see, he played that game, therefore he

459
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,700
must have learned, you know, the kill from that game.

460
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:09,400
But apparently he also played other games, you know, that weren't violent.

461
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,400
Who cares?

462
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,400
I mean.

463
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,480
No, I'm thinking he was a couple bricks shy of a load, if you know what I mean, and shouldn't

464
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,140
have been playing any video games at all.

465
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,120
He should have been in school reading.

466
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,640
Did you see the videos of him on CNN?

467
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,760
No, I don't watch the news.

468
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:28,320
I watch, I do, they have CNN on them, I work, and I do regularly read CNN.com and BBC World

469
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,320
News.

470
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:36,040
But yes, I keep up with current events, and the guy was psycho anyway, he was talking

471
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:40,200
about how he just wanted to kill everybody, showing off his gun collection, his knife

472
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,200
collection.

473
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:47,440
This guy, I don't think a real gamer would have been that crazy, he was nuts.

474
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:53,160
But it's all the game's fault, it's all about the game, what did the games do to him?

475
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,800
I blame his psychosis and his parents for not being more observant.

476
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,180
I don't think it was his favorite game, but you know what, when you see that, of course,

477
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:04,120
if you're going to be trying to spin this in the news, that's going to get the most

478
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,120
attention.

479
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,880
So let's of course blame it on the games.

480
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,560
Naturally, lots of feedback.

481
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:13,680
Chat room over at orangeontrader.com, click on chat, olarmieddy says, Super Columbine

482
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,840
RPG does not glorify school shootings at all.

483
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:21,600
Let's see, I always butcher this name, Jamie, help me, Nazgul Slayer?

484
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,600
Nazgul?

485
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,600
Nazgul.

486
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,160
Damn it, that one fucks me up.

487
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:31,400
Nazgul Slayer says, he used RPG Maker 2000 to make Super Columbine Massacre, I read an

488
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,440
article about it.

489
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:37,720
So it's not really Super Columbine Massacre that's a problem, it's RPG Maker, the devil's

490
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,720
game.

491
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,720
No, no, no.

492
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,720
I'm attacking the darkness.

493
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,600
I'm using magic missile.

494
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:50,440
Sakurina would like to point out, also his gun was legal but his clips weren't.

495
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,680
Hmm, interesting.

496
00:28:52,680 --> 00:29:02,760
You know what, this is, it just further illustrates that society is more ready to look for a scapegoat

497
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,720
than actually treat the true root of the problem.

498
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,780
Do these kind of stories make you angry, DarkSakura?

499
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:11,120
They make me furious, livid, ludicrously livid.

500
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,860
Do they make you want to rant a little bit?

501
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,120
They make me want to go to a school and shoot people.

502
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:34,920
Well it wouldn't be episode 200 of a podcast without the FUs of the Week.

503
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:42,160
My FU of the Week, I can't believe I completely blamed, I had what my FU was going to be and

504
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,840
it wasn't related to traffic at all.

505
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,800
My FU of the Week goes toward the Japantown Anime Festival.

506
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,960
Oh my god, crappiest convention ever.

507
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:58,560
Well, in their defense they were pretty small.

508
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,840
I mean, but still.

509
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:05,200
Hey, that's not nice talking about the Japanese being small.

510
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,240
Okay, this is my Pokemon.

511
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,240
You connect all your Pokemon.

512
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:17,600
I understand, my problem with it being, no this is in San Francisco by the way, my problem

513
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:23,720
with it was that it suffered the same problem that AX started to suffer, as in being spread

514
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:29,640
across different areas, you had to go from one mall to the other, into the hotel, into

515
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:37,000
the courtyard downstairs under Kinokuniya at Kintetsu Mall, but they had a pretty good

516
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,600
band that we were there for listening to the warm up, they actually sounded pretty cool

517
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:45,880
but the dealer's room, it was a dealer's closet, the closet, and they had some interesting

518
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:51,200
stuff, some nice stuff, but you know, overall it was pretty much what you could find online

519
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,200
pretty easily.

520
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,800
But the cost, the way I was most disappointed with was the cosplay.

521
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:01,080
I expected to go and see people taking advantage of the opportunity to cosplay, there was a

522
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:06,920
pretty big Naruto group, there was a pretty big bleach group, but it's been done.

523
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:13,880
Yeah, I could go see that at any other convention, we did meet lots of nice people, we met some

524
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:19,920
people on DA, on DeviantArt who were really cool, but overall I think I had a higher expectation

525
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,920
for it just because of how it was being played up, they were having all this different stuff

526
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:30,280
go on, and it really was just, just, blah.

527
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:34,640
The only advantage of it is that our badges gave us discounts at the stores, so I could

528
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,720
buy porn.

529
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:46,040
Um, Loki, you have views of the week, mine don't have to do with porn.

530
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:51,600
F you to Wicker Man, that movie, why did they have to kill Nicolas Cage's character off,

531
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,040
I mean, it was getting good, like the whole movie is kind of like eh, okay this whole

532
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,040
island with...

533
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,200
Wow, thanks for saving me ten bucks!

534
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,360
And isn't that how the original ended?

535
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,000
Yes, but I'll get to that.

536
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,680
So here's the thing, why did they have to kill his character off, it started getting

537
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:12,120
good, I mean he punched a woman in the face, and I was like, god damn this movie's gonna

538
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:18,120
be awesome, then, fucking um, oh god I can't remember her name, the chick from Save the

539
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:22,720
Last Dance or whatever, I think she was in that, and she like lunges at me, like does

540
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,880
a sidekick and kicks her into the wall, I'm like, oh my god this movie just got a hundred

541
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:30,320
times better, and then they had to go set him on fire, so you know, that fucking sucks.

542
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,280
I don't care if that's how the original sucked, the end, actually the whole movie should have

543
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:40,400
had just like Chuck Norris killing people, and that would have been a lot better.

544
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:45,680
The Wicker Man is supposed to be burnt, for any of our fellow pagans listening to the

545
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,680
show.

546
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,680
The Burning Man?

547
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:51,520
Yeah, the whole movie reminded me of Burning Man, like in Seattle or something, you know,

548
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:58,320
it's like, alright, um, my FU of the week goes to my iPod, which upon boot up today

549
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,720
gave me a frowny face of death.

550
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,000
I blame iTunes 7, because ever since I installed iTunes 7, that thing started acting weird,

551
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,480
like iTunes did not want to talk to my old ass, you know, fourth gen iPod or whatever

552
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:16,040
it is, the black and white before they were color, iPod, so, FU iTunes 7 for ruining my

553
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:21,960
iPod, and now I can't listen to podcasts in my car, so, no Bobby, no All Games, no other

554
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:28,120
podcasts I listen to, or OLR in my car for a while, until I can afford the video iPod.

555
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:35,440
So FU frowny face of death, I blame Apple, Loki, just bite your tongue, Chris, I blame

556
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,760
the lack of rockbox, how about your, okay, Drew Nami, your FUs of the week.

557
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:44,280
Alright, first off, FU to missing class, for an entire week, including the week where both

558
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:49,760
the practice test and the test were going on, due to people having appointments and

559
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:55,680
me either forgetting or them not telling me, I can't remember which, aside from that, just

560
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:02,720
FU to having a very blah week, with nothing else going on, so, no FUs at all for, you

561
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,720
know, past that, Chris?

562
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,600
I just wanted to really quickly say, sorry to the chatroom, restore didn't work and reset

563
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,720
didn't work, thanks for the thought, but, tried it, sorry.

564
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:21,480
Okay, for lack of anything better, my FU of the week is to my bed at home, it for some

565
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:27,280
reason thinks that I need to be molested in the middle of the night, what kind of bed

566
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:34,280
is this, I want to buy one, IKEA actually, alright, okay, there is only one bed, god

567
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:41,740
I love Sweden, okay, I'd never let any of my friends, ABBA and molesting beds, it doesn't

568
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:47,800
get much better than that, do you want to hear my story or not, okay, okay, we, okay,

569
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,000
there's only one other bed that's available at my house when my friends come over and

570
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,040
that's the one my dad and his girlfriend use, so they have to sleep in my bed and twice

571
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:01,880
I woke it up to my friends trying to molest me, Jamie slept in there last night and she

572
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:13,400
was all trying to pet my chest, okay, I was having a dream, this show just got a lot hotter,

573
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:18,240
I was having a dream about a couple of characters and they were like just sleeping in the bed

574
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,120
and there was a cat there and this is what Shermie does, she'll crawl in the bed between

575
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:28,520
me and Dan and I'll reach over and pet her, so in the dream, I guess the character there

576
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:33,320
in my dream was reaching over to pet the cat and I opened my eyes to see my hand hovering

577
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:39,240
over Kristen's chest and I was like oh you're not a cat, that was Marissa's reaction except

578
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:46,400
she said oh you don't have a penis, she thought my friend Marissa came down a few weekends

579
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,400
ago and she thought I was her boyfriend Christopher and was all rubbing my back and she's like

580
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:56,040
oh wait you don't have a penis and turned over and fell asleep, so people want to molest

581
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,800
me in my bed.

582
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,480
And to respond to Jeremy Todd, I have had a hot lesbian dream about Angelina Jolie,

583
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,480
thank you.

584
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:09,880
I think I've had a hot lesbian dream about Angelina Jolie, actually, who hasn't had a

585
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,880
hot lesbian dream about her?

586
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,720
I'm not kidding either and I also had one about Billy Paper.

587
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:28,400
Alright anyway, we had a story earlier in the program about Final Fantasy XII and Final

588
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,720
Fantasy XII Day, well maybe there will be two Final Fantasy XII Days because guess what?

589
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:37,980
There is a Final Fantasy XII related title coming to the DS, not a lot of information

590
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:42,360
on it at this time, it is called Final Fantasy Revenant Wings and it's going to be a sequel

591
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:51,120
to Final Fantasy XII and will be available on Nintendo DS, hmm interesting.

592
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:55,640
We do know it's got a pirate themed storyline and could possibly be a prequel, not a sequel

593
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,320
to Final Fantasy XII.

594
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:03,360
That's interesting that it's on the PSP, oh maybe because PSP sucks in Japan.

595
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,680
Don't know, don't know.

596
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:11,500
Alright well Dark Sakura, for 200 weeks now she's surfed the internet up and down, actually

597
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,040
just kidding because we didn't have this segment until about 170, but she surfs the internet

598
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,320
up and down each and every week to find a website that you want to be visiting and she

599
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,640
shares it with you folks in a segment we call the website of the week.

600
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:28,600
Dark Sakura, where should the kids be pointing their browsers to this week?

601
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:34,160
The website of the week, this one is a very special one, especially for episode 200.

602
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:40,380
The website of the week is orangeloungeradio.com, you must go to our site everyday, hang out

603
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:44,880
on our forums, we are awesome, if you find news stories, link them up there, if we don't

604
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,600
think it's utter crap then we'll put it up on the board and you get to talk to us, because

605
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,600
it's special.

606
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:59,000
And you know I figured it's about damn time that I plug our own damn site, so orangeloungeradio.com

607
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,160
is the site of the week, shameless self-promotion, damn right.

608
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:14,280
And you can go to E3 on PSP, it's about as updated as the OLR on PSP.

609
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:21,080
If you want to see something that hasn't been updated in like 5 years, there's darksakura.com.

610
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:26,840
Seriously I haven't updated it in 5 years.

611
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,840
Good job!

612
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,600
And we have our blogs at stuff.orangeloungeradio.com.

613
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,160
Those blogs haven't been updated in like a year.

614
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,600
Well alright, we better.

615
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,600
Get on that.

616
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,440
And there's my Jack Thompson is a Bully rant on there too.

617
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,080
There's some good reads on there if you haven't seen it yet.

618
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:48,200
Anyways, what's kind of interesting and very disappointing to me is that it was announced

619
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:55,640
this week that the PS3 controller will not be named Poos, it will be named Sixaxis or

620
00:38:55,640 --> 00:39:03,360
Siaxis or whatever, it basically comes from the fact that the controller has six different

621
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:09,400
axes of motion sensing, and yeah, since it doesn't rumble I guess they can't really call

622
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,080
it DualShock now can they?

623
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:16,640
So Sixaxis is the name of the controller, hooray.

624
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,580
It's also Palindrome.

625
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,920
How do we find this out for sure?

626
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,840
How do we know for sure that this is the name of it?

627
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:32,480
Well actually this was from a patent, or I should say a trademark that was registered,

628
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,460
and it's been pulled up and it's owned by Sony, so hurrah.

629
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:39,040
What if they're just trying a couple things out?

630
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:45,720
It's true, I don't know if it's for sure, but you know what, it's also been mentioned

631
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:53,320
Sixaxis in a few different PR things, not as, you know, it might be like the system,

632
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:57,760
named for the system of the motion sensing, like for example, it says, this one quote

633
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,120
here, the controller for the PS3 employs breakthrough technology of high precision, highly sensitive

634
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:08,840
Sixaxis sensing system that does not require any devices other than the controller itself

635
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,640
for seamless interactive operation.

636
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:18,080
So that might be just, you know, the technology they're calling it Sixaxis, I don't know.

637
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,080
Interesting.

638
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:23,600
All right, well every week you guys write us letters and we read them right here on

639
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,960
Orange Lounge Radio's podcast.

640
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,580
If you want to send us an email, it's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and when you send

641
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:39,920
your email, Dark Sakura suits up in her biohazard suit and puts on her rubber gloves, and digs

642
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,320
on into the mailbag and pulls out some of her favorite emails that she's going to share

643
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:48,120
with us right now, and these are special emails because this is the 200th episode worth of

644
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,120
emails.

645
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:57,600
So if you're in tonight's mailbag, you're very special, boys and girls.

646
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:02,240
Some skanky, skanky hoe bag named DisneyPunk10 sent us an email.

647
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:07,600
This says, all you guys suck, Rob is not sexy, Loki is stupid, Jamie is a mean bitch.

648
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:11,680
Your show is full of lesbians and 30-year-old children who live in their parents' cellar.

649
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,680
Die!

650
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,680
Is that good enough hate mail?

651
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,360
No, you know I love you guys, happy 200.

652
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,520
Chris, isn't your online name DisneyPunk10?

653
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,520
DisneyButt?

654
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,520
DisneyButt?

655
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,720
That's why I'm going to start calling you after that email.

656
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,720
Why, yes!

657
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:29,120
As a matter of fact, DisneyPunk10 is my handle.

658
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,480
That's an awful coincidence.

659
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,640
Well thanks for the hate mail.

660
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,600
We love getting hate mail at orangeloungeradio.com.

661
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,600
Bitch.

662
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,160
We'll get Maisie to check it out of her later.

663
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,280
Nah, she brings me cake, I love her.

664
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,280
And donuts.

665
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,280
And crowns.

666
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,280
And crowns.

667
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,280
Yep.

668
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:49,600
I'm going to go parade in the living room right now while Jamie reads the next email

669
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,720
and listen for the laughter.

670
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:57,320
You look like such a lovely princess, Rob.

671
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:04,040
And anyway, our next email comes from Robert M. Now that Apple has announced that you can

672
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:09,200
purchase games for the iPod, what do you see becoming of this form of mobile gaming?

673
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:14,040
I may pick up Bejeweled just to see, but later it'll be interesting to see how the unit's

674
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:17,600
limited control are basically like an Atari 2600 paddle controller.

675
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:21,320
I really wonder even seeing the preview of how Pac-Man is controlled is used.

676
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:26,600
I can imagine a great version of Jairus for instance.

677
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,560
Also how does this open up the possibility of homebrewed games?

678
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:32,760
It's easy to make your own music and movies and play them on the iPod without ever starting

679
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,840
an account to buy them, but what about those with skill and patience to program full games?

680
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,880
I thought they already had homebrew games.

681
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:44,240
Like they had Doom on there for what reason, I don't know.

682
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,320
They said hail to the queen when I walked out there.

683
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,600
Bitches.

684
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:53,120
I think since they've already got it, we'll see more homebrew games.

685
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,160
I missed the reading of the email.

686
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,160
Was this about the iPod games?

687
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,160
Yeah.

688
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,160
Okay, because I dug in there earlier in the week.

689
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,240
I thought I saw some gay in there.

690
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,240
I don't know.

691
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:07,440
The problem with gaming on the iPod is that frickin' wheel.

692
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,840
That's not the best controller in the world.

693
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,520
You know what would be great though is that little thing that you plug your USB thing

694
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,520
into in the bottom?

695
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:18,600
Wouldn't that be an awesome place to just jam a controller into and then there you go.

696
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,600
That's what Apple should do.

697
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,600
Apple will make more money.

698
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,240
I think that would be a smart idea.

699
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,840
If Apple wanted to get into gaming on the iPod, that would be a great addition, but

700
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,840
what do I know?

701
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,600
I'm just some schmo on the internet.

702
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:34,480
Our next email says, Dear OLR crew, I would like to say thank you for the past 1.5 years

703
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,480
of entertainment.

704
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:39,540
I went into the gigantic list of gaming podcasts and my first random pick happened to be this

705
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:40,540
wonderful podcast.

706
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:42,640
I've been listening ever since and it's been fun.

707
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,000
The host and guest hosts are great.

708
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,240
Also this podcast introduced to some of the coolest bands, Gorillaz, Freeze Pop, Games

709
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:55,080
Guitar Hero, Katamari, Websites, Gorillaz and Official DeviantArt, and Survival Tips.

710
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,200
I now know how to stop a camel.

711
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,440
Thanks for being a part of all your listener's life.

712
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,440
Reject false icons.

713
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,440
Ion671.

714
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,440
PS.

715
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,440
Come to the East Coast sometime.

716
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:08,920
That was sweet and I'm coming to New York City end of October and I'm going to be going

717
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,800
to the Nintendo World Store to meet fans.

718
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,800
So I don't know what day that is.

719
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,800
I would like to go, but I'm going to YowieCon.

720
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,800
Hot.

721
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,200
That was a sweet email.

722
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,200
Thank you.

723
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,200
Heart.

724
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:24,840
For anyone who wants to know where I got my survival tips from, it's the Worst Case Scenario

725
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:25,840
Survival Handbook.

726
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:26,840
Whoa.

727
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,840
Sorry.

728
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:28,840
Sorry.

729
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:29,840
We had a snafu there.

730
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,600
A Neverending Story started playing in the background there.

731
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,600
Sorry guys.

732
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,320
The Neverending Soda.

733
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:38,320
My bad.

734
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,840
Next up is Warrior Bob.

735
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,440
That's such a cool name.

736
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,440
Hello again.

737
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,680
It was neat to hear my last letter read on air.

738
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:46,680
Thanks for that.

739
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,880
You are correct that you guys were invited to Cal Poly SLO sometime last year, although

740
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:55,080
it wasn't me, but rather our DDR Club President, a guy named Joe Etter, who actually invited

741
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:58,840
you to come down to a Bamani-related event that the club ran.

742
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,240
That's what it is.

743
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:04,240
Of course, if you ever do make it to my school, I bet we could arrange to have all our part

744
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,740
of the show broadcast over our local station.

745
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:13,240
You probably have to tone down the lesbian pillow fights, but it may be a good way to

746
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:17,280
get some exposure to the non-podcast audience.

747
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,840
Reading that again to myself, I suppose lesbian pillow fights may have a similar effect.

748
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,000
You know, I didn't mean to bring that in.

749
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
That was an accident.

750
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
No, it's fine.

751
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
It's fine.

752
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,280
Regardless, were it feasible, I'd definitely attend a traveling OLR show.

753
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,680
I had to miss the Fonami panel last spring, so I'd love to have that sort of thing happen

754
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:35,680
again.

755
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,680
We will, by the way, be at Fonami next year.

756
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:41,200
Fonami next year, and it looks like Sakura Con is also for Seattle people.

757
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:46,040
We're going to be there, and possibly, at least myself, we'll be at one East Coast Con,

758
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,520
so we're going to be doing Anime Cons up the butt next year.

759
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:52,960
I want to try and get to Otacon next year, but I can't get to Otacon for that yet, but

760
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:53,960
more on this.

761
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:54,960
Huh?

762
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:00,560
I'm going to Asa next year, and Megzi, so we can try something.

763
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,560
Flyer girls!

764
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:05,440
We can walk around with a shirt or something stupid like that.

765
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,200
Afterwards we'll drink Guinness and play old games.

766
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,200
It'll be a party.

767
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,200
I love Guinness.

768
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,200
That is hot.

769
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,200
That is my idea of a party.

770
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,500
Looking forward to your show hitting the podcast stream, so I'll hear you then.

771
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:14,500
Have a great night.

772
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,480
Unrelatedly, fuck Pyrite.

773
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,480
Amen!

774
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,120
Pyrite is a cult.

775
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,520
That is a card-carrying OLR member.

776
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,120
For a second there, I thought you said Pyrite, and I'm like, damn that fool's goal, damn

777
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,120
it!

778
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,520
Pyrite is also a false icon.

779
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:32,640
Pyrite is cool because it crystalizes in cube form.

780
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,640
I took chemistry, hello!

781
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,360
For science!

782
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,360
Science and technology!

783
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,360
Anyway.

784
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,360
Science!

785
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,360
We should ban Dihydrogen Monoxide.

786
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:47,040
Yeah, you know that Dihydrogen Monoxide is just... water.

787
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,040
I know.

788
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,040
Wasn't that on an episode of...

789
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,040
Penn & Teller's bullshit.

790
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,040
One of my friends was just telling me about that episode.

791
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,040
Anyway, next email.

792
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,040
Okay.

793
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:59,480
Hey, OLR, just wanted to congratulate you on your 200th episode since I won't be listening

794
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:00,480
live tonight.

795
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,480
Have a good one.

796
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,480
And that's from Mike.

797
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,160
Thank you.

798
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,160
Next one up.

799
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,240
Ooh, long one.

800
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:13,600
Not long one, but this is actually from Kenji, who I posted his email as my email of the

801
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,600
month.

802
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:15,600
Oh, this is our essay writer.

803
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,220
I'm going to start doing an email of the month, by the way, so make sure you start sending

804
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:23,240
in very thoughtful and well-written things that don't have hate in them.

805
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,520
Happy 200th episode, OLR.

806
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,080
Congratulations on making it this far, and here's hoping for your continued successes

807
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,080
and good fortune.

808
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,080
Cheers.

809
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,080
This won't be long.

810
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,680
I figure that everything I mention in this letter will already be mentioned before you

811
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,440
even touch this week's mailbag.

812
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,320
They blew it, blew it, blew it, blew it.

813
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,200
Nintendo couldn't have been set up any better.

814
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,360
$600 PS3 on November 17th.

815
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,280
Ken Kutaragi stick up his ass.

816
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:48,760
Microsoft with a dollar sign problem with selling 360s in every other market in the

817
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:49,760
U.S.

818
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:50,760
The cards were all laid out in Nintendo's favor.

819
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:55,400
All Reggie had to say was $199, October something or the other, and get off the stage.

820
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,400
But they didn't.

821
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,400
That isn't to say it's not a bad thing selling two days of GASP after the already impossible

822
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,840
to reserve PS3 for $250 with a pack-in compilation game.

823
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:07,140
It's just that they could have really went over the hearts and minds of gamers and non-gamers

824
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:11,040
alike with a cheaper price point, or included a second controller set.

825
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,480
But is Nintendo selling systems at a profit?

826
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,480
What else is new?

827
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:18,360
Also, does anyone else see the pick-to-chat-like qualities in the Wii channels?

828
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:21,080
Hell, it might just be the system alone.

829
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:25,160
Just as pick-to-chat sold DS systems in Japan without selling any accompanying software,

830
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,680
photo channel and the Mii channel especially seem to be the quirky things that'll keep

831
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,480
non-gamers entertained for hours.

832
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:35,680
Then they have the Wii forums, where you can post stuff with your character chair as your

833
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,680
little avatar.

834
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,780
Yeah, but that's specific to your Wii, right?

835
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:40,120
That's not internet Wii.

836
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,120
I'm not sure.

837
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,120
I think it was your own Wii.

838
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:44,600
It was like for family members to leave messages to each other.

839
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,600
Hi, Mom!

840
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,600
You suck!

841
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,600
Stop playing!

842
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,600
Dad's a whore.

843
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:53,160
For a good time, call Mom at...

844
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,160
Last night!

845
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,160
Ooh!

846
00:48:55,160 --> 00:49:02,080
And it said, uh, man, just my opinions from a slightly educated gamer, but if you haven't

847
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:07,520
answered this already, will the higher next, near next-gen price point keep you guys from

848
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,520
getting a Wii?

849
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:09,840
Thanks and congrats again, Kenji.

850
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:15,160
Well, didn't he say, I mean, I think this guy's great and all because he has a lot to

851
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:19,160
say, but didn't he just say, you know, Nintendo fucked up and then he said, but it sounds

852
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,560
kind of neat.

853
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:25,720
I think what the intention was is that Nintendo could have gotten a whole lot more in terms

854
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:29,840
of new people buying the system had it just been dropped a little bit more, had a few

855
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,520
more pack-ins.

856
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,520
It's not doom and gloom.

857
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,800
It's still the cheapest.

858
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,320
It's still the cheapest one on the shelf.

859
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:40,240
It's not only the cheapest one on the shelf, but it's the cheapest one on the shelf with

860
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,240
the game.

861
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:44,440
And you can buy that in a 360 and still not pay as much as you would for...

862
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,440
Wii 60!

863
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:50,560
I'm pre-ordering one in both GameStop and my work, so I may have two.

864
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:54,640
Because my GameStop, or my one where I work, will probably be getting it in on Wednesday

865
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,360
before the launch.

866
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:59,440
I'm not allowed to talk about how I'm getting a Wii, but I am getting a Wii, and I will

867
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,640
have it on release day.

868
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:04,080
Well, we'll have ours on release day.

869
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,080
We all will because we're special.

870
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:09,360
Anyway, the last email tonight comes from Alessa.

871
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,360
Cool.

872
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,080
Dude, like Silent Hill?

873
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,080
I don't know.

874
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,520
I don't know if I'm excited about that.

875
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,520
No, I'm kidding.

876
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:19,880
It's actually a link to an article about a father that killed his child over a video

877
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:20,880
game.

878
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,880
Is there a hole in the email?

879
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:24,880
Oh no.

880
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:25,880
What happened?

881
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:26,880
And I looked at this.

882
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,880
I'll link it in the chat.

883
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:28,880
What's he playing World of Warcraft?

884
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:29,880
It's on NBC10.com.

885
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,880
I'll just read a little bit of the article.

886
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:35,060
A 25-year-old North Philadelphia man has been charged with killing his young daughter.

887
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:42,920
The mother said 17-month-old Alaya was violently punched by Tyrone Spellman over a video game.

888
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:47,920
Reading further in the article, apparently, just being a cute little kid, she was pulling

889
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:54,640
on the controller cord, playing with it, and the system fell, and he apparently was so

890
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,960
upset he punched her in the face twice.

891
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:01,760
When the mother came in to ask, because she was taking a nap.

892
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,460
She didn't know anything was happening.

893
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:09,360
When she got up to check on her daughter, she asked why she's not breathing, and he

894
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,360
said, she's breathing.

895
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,440
She's just asleep or something like that.

896
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:21,000
She called the ambulance, and she was pronounced dead at the scene.

897
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,720
Apparently this guy was supposed to be...

898
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:29,640
They said that he was a fairly non-violent person, but first of all, I think the game

899
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,280
has nothing to do with it.

900
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:36,880
What if he had been playing, building a house of cards, and she knocked it over?

901
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:42,180
If he's given to punch somebody over something, especially a child, over something so trivial,

902
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:43,640
he would have done it over anything.

903
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:46,040
There's some type of violent gene there.

904
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:49,360
That's definitely, has nothing to do with a video game.

905
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:52,040
That is one seriously, mentally fucked up person.

906
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:56,400
On a completely unrelated note, five bucks says it was Madden.

907
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,980
I kid, I kid, I kid.

908
00:51:58,980 --> 00:51:59,980
You can direct an email.

909
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:04,560
Baby Tossing 2000, you know, on the Xbox 360 Arcade, apparently.

910
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:07,000
It actually doesn't say what game it is.

911
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,440
Nintendog Sniper 2006.

912
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:14,520
The sad thing is that the lady was pregnant with another, she's eight months pregnant

913
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,560
with another baby.

914
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:19,040
The good news is he'll be the hell away from that one.

915
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,880
Well, yeah, he is locked up.

916
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,040
They're actually charging him with murder, endangering the welfare of a child, and possession

917
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,200
of an instrument of crime.

918
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:31,500
And but the thing that struck me is that the lady was saying that, you know, that her daughter

919
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:34,160
is never going to meet her big sister.

920
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,560
That was what got me on that.

921
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:38,520
GS68 in our chat room says, I'll say it now.

922
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,160
Shut up, Jack.

923
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,880
Seriously, you know he's going to hop on that shit.

924
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:48,940
But again, I don't think it was what he was doing so much.

925
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:53,520
You know, if she had toppled over something else he might have been working on, if he

926
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:59,640
was that mentally unstable to strike a child, you know, then he would have done it over

927
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,640
anything.

928
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:06,640
Well, I'm not sure how to transition into this story.

929
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:11,640
I suppose I could say something about at least he didn't throw the Guitar Hero controller.

930
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:12,640
I don't know.

931
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,000
But this is a story on Guitar Hero 2.

932
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,080
New song is announced for the game.

933
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:21,880
Mega Death with Hangar 18 is supposedly going to be like the last final boss song in the

934
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:22,880
game.

935
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:23,880
Pretty rad.

936
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:28,560
Aerosmith with Last Child, and this song I think is pretty cool coming to Guitar Hero

937
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:29,560
2.

938
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:31,760
Cheap Trick with Surrender.

939
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,880
That's going to be kind of fun.

940
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,880
I like that.

941
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:36,440
They've already announced the one song I was most interested in, though.

942
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:37,440
What the Spinal Tap?

943
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,440
No, YYZ.

944
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,440
Oh.

945
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,440
Aren't you a big fan of the Spinal Tap?

946
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,440
I love Rush.

947
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,440
All right.

948
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,440
Rush is cool.

949
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:48,380
Anyways, I'm glad to see that Guitar Hero 2 seems to be on its way to being finished.

950
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:54,200
Here's another game which supposedly is going to be finished pretty soon.

951
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:58,580
Duke Nukem Forever is apparently in the polish stage.

952
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:00,760
I don't know what that thought does that mean.

953
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:02,080
The polish stage?

954
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:07,280
It means that the physics and animation systems are virtually finished and shippable.

955
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,020
It's simply maintenance and polish from here on out.

956
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:15,200
We haven't needed to make substantial changes to those systems in months.

957
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,040
I think they mean polishes and polishing a turd.

958
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,400
The changes have been made.

959
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,800
Sorry the game's delayed.

960
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:27,080
We've all been too busy polishing our poles.

961
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:32,640
Then he goes on to say, things are never as bleak as they appear, as often is the case

962
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,880
when you simply have one side of the story.

963
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:41,640
This is coming from 3D Realms president George Broussard.

964
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:48,520
I don't know, I would think that a ten year delay on the game is pretty bleak if you ask

965
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:49,520
me.

966
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,520
It worked for Prey.

967
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,080
No, it didn't really work for Prey.

968
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,600
True said it worked for Prey.

969
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:55,600
Prey?

970
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:56,600
I don't think so.

971
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,480
It wasn't that great of a game.

972
00:54:58,480 --> 00:54:59,480
Prey's kind of fun.

973
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:05,480
It was kind of fun, but kind of fun isn't like, wow, ten years in the making.

974
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:10,200
We'll see how the free expansion pack is that's supposedly coming.

975
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:18,440
Well, you know how we're always bringing up some of our more quirky games?

976
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:22,080
Well, Majesco is bringing Cake Mania to the DS.

977
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:25,760
Did anybody get Cooking Mama?

978
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,660
Actually wasn't Majesco talking about that game?

979
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:31,320
I was looking at a Miggletop's copy of Cooking Mama, but I didn't get a chance to play it,

980
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,320
but I hear it's kind of fun.

981
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:35,320
Sorry, Cake Mania makes me think, you know, it makes me think of cooking.

982
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:36,320
Sorry.

983
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:42,920
They actually mentioned Cooking Mama in this, but they're actually bringing out Cake Mania.

984
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:49,160
It's an online game from Sandlot Games, but Cake Mania will bring in the touch screen

985
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:54,960
part so you can bake your cakes with extra touch power, I guess, but it will be the full

986
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:59,420
game plus the Back to the Bakery expansion pack.

987
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:04,760
So if anyone's into the weirdo quirk stuff, it will be coming out for 20 bucks.

988
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:05,760
All right.

989
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,980
It's developed by Digital Embryo, which I think is a cool name.

990
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:13,640
Another series that Majesco is going to be bringing out, they have two titles in development

991
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:14,980
for the Wii.

992
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:18,800
One of them is Bust a Move, because that freaking game comes out on every console.

993
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:23,720
Sorry, I meant the American Bust a Move or Puzzle Bobble, not the other Bust a Move that

994
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,720
you guys are big fans of.

995
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:31,040
The other one that they are bringing over is supposed to be a mystery title.

996
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,800
It's going to be something that makes use of the Wiimote.

997
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:37,960
Oh, I'm sorry, no, that's more on the Bust a Move, is that it will be using the Wiimote's

998
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:38,960
motion.

999
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,760
There is actually no other information about the other title.

1000
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:43,120
I wonder if it's not kind of a... Oh, no, because it's for the Wii.

1001
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:46,560
I was wondering if it was maybe the Cake Mania thing came out later or something, but I guess

1002
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:47,560
not.

1003
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:48,880
There's ones for the DS and ones for the Wii.

1004
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,480
So we should have more information pretty soon.

1005
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:57,240
Anyway, that's going to bring to an end this part B of our podcast.

1006
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,640
I know you guys are thinking, wait a minute, you haven't taken calls yet.

1007
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,280
You haven't done last minute stories yet.

1008
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:06,040
Well, tonight, guys, for our very special episode number 200, we're going to be doing

1009
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:08,880
a part C. So we're going to go to a quick break here.

1010
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,720
We'll come back with Orange Launch Radio part C, and I'll tell you what, part C is going

1011
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:15,080
to be very different tonight because we're going to do a little bit of gaming news and

1012
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:19,580
then it's about us and kind of celebrating 200 episodes of Orange Launch Radio and taking

1013
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:20,580
your calls.

1014
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:25,120
We've got a lot to take a look at, and it will all be on Orange Launch Radio part C

1015
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:27,840
right after this.

1016
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,440
How does it all end?

1017
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:43,680
Find out later this week when part C of episode 200 hits our podcast feed.
