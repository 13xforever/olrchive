2
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:25,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on this lovely Sunday evening, September the 17th of 2006.

3
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:29,703
[SPEAKER_03]: It is our 200th episode tonight, so it's a little bit crazy, but that's alright.

4
00:00:29,923 --> 00:00:32,964
[SPEAKER_03]: What else can we do here to celebrate our 200th episode?

5
00:00:32,984 --> 00:00:34,405
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a little cake during the break.

6
00:00:34,705 --> 00:00:36,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Chris, for bringing the chocolate cake.

7
00:00:37,005 --> 00:00:38,926
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm filled with chocolatey goodness now.

8
00:00:38,986 --> 00:00:39,406
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.

9
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,167
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're going to get back into what we do well here.

10
00:00:42,207 --> 00:00:43,487
[SPEAKER_03]: It is some gaming news.

11
00:00:44,048 --> 00:00:44,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, start us off.

12
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:57,557
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and as we talked about in Part A about the Wii being region-free or not being region-free, we still don't know, there is rumors that the PlayStation 3 may be region-free, and there might be confirmation on that.

13
00:00:57,837 --> 00:01:14,243
[SPEAKER_01]: According to a Resistance Fall of Man video interview posted on Game Videos, the PlayStation 3 may indeed be region-free, and basically the kind of proof for that is that they're talking about multiple versions of the game

14
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:22,254
[SPEAKER_01]: All the videos being, you know, put in there in both the high def formats including PAL on one disc.

15
00:01:22,674 --> 00:01:29,858
[SPEAKER_01]: So people are, you know, kind of assuming, okay, so there's going to be one run of the game that's going to be, you know, throughout the world.

16
00:01:30,138 --> 00:01:34,500
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, maybe kind of some proof that there might be some region free games.

17
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:42,264
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, if anything, it's going to be like, you know, the 360 whereas some games are region free if the developers want them, some games aren't.

18
00:01:43,084 --> 00:01:44,285
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's probably what you're going to see.

19
00:01:45,714 --> 00:01:46,034
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

20
00:02:14,086 --> 00:02:14,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Forget the imports.

21
00:02:14,932 --> 00:02:16,382
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just have to live without it.

22
00:02:17,426 --> 00:02:17,866
[SPEAKER_03]: X-Fire X-Fire X-Fire

23
00:02:46,067 --> 00:02:48,187
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be very excited to see something like this come to PlayStation 3.

24
00:02:48,367 --> 00:02:49,308
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a quote this week.

25
00:02:49,888 --> 00:02:53,928
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it was a one-up reporting from a transcript of Viacom's report.

26
00:02:54,328 --> 00:03:05,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Quote, importantly, Xfire just signed a deal with Sony to create a version of their platform for the new PlayStation 3, which will now enable Xfire to extend its reach further into the huge console gaming market.

27
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:14,192
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're saying that Untold Legends Dark Kingdom, which was a PS3 launch exclusive, was in Xfire's PC initialization file.

28
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:20,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, after this story sat on the internet for a couple days before you folks in the chatroom start yelling at us and telling us, you know, wait a minute, wait a minute.

29
00:03:21,012 --> 00:03:28,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we do know little news came out a little later that says, actually, Sony doesn't plan to be fully integrating X-Fire right here.

30
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,180
[SPEAKER_03]: This was just for this one game.

31
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,240
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

32
00:03:31,441 --> 00:03:34,123
[SPEAKER_03]: I still find this partnership to be very interesting nonetheless.

33
00:03:34,223 --> 00:03:34,963
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you guys think?

34
00:03:35,004 --> 00:03:36,565
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Loki, you know a lot about X-Fire.

35
00:03:36,585 --> 00:03:37,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you use it at all?

36
00:03:37,546 --> 00:03:38,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

37
00:03:38,386 --> 00:03:41,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what do you think about teaming up with a PC-based...

38
00:03:42,162 --> 00:03:49,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, might as well since Sony doesn't seem to know what they're asked from their foot as far as online services go.

39
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:51,986
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, how do you know they don't have something already and they just haven't said anything yet?

40
00:03:52,686 --> 00:03:57,508
[SPEAKER_01]: Because their whole answer is like, yes, our services will be exactly what Xbox Live is.

41
00:03:58,214 --> 00:04:00,975
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, since they can't really innovate on that, I guess.

42
00:04:01,495 --> 00:04:12,877
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, they haven't really said anything about it, and the fact that there's a lack of information about what they're providing on their online service makes me think, hmm, they don't know what they're providing on their online service yet.

43
00:04:13,097 --> 00:04:15,557
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have a plan whatsoever.

44
00:04:15,997 --> 00:04:23,799
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I'm sure, you know, we're going to hear more about their online service and about their games at Tokyo Game Show in a few weeks, but...

45
00:04:24,861 --> 00:04:30,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Until then, I don't think they know shit about their online service right now, and I think it's just kind of pieced together.

46
00:04:30,962 --> 00:04:35,063
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think you just said what exactly is going to prove your statement wrong, Tokyo Game Show.

47
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,563
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're going to get the answers to our questions there.

48
00:04:37,603 --> 00:04:44,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, until then, I still think that their online service is very pieced together, and I don't know.

49
00:04:45,165 --> 00:04:46,625
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't sound very good so far.

50
00:04:47,085 --> 00:04:48,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, any thoughts from you?

51
00:04:48,145 --> 00:04:52,926
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you don't really do a lot of PC gaming, but... I have AIM.

52
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:56,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, X-Files kind of like it in a way.

53
00:04:56,868 --> 00:04:57,689
[SPEAKER_06]: I have AIM.

54
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:00,810
[SPEAKER_03]: What if PlayStation 3 had AIM on it?

55
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Would that be cool?

56
00:05:03,191 --> 00:05:05,832
[SPEAKER_06]: I probably wouldn't use it on there because I'd be too busy playing a game.

57
00:05:06,993 --> 00:05:07,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh.

58
00:05:08,053 --> 00:05:08,333
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

59
00:05:09,454 --> 00:05:10,134
[SPEAKER_01]: Good thought, I guess.

60
00:05:10,414 --> 00:05:11,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, yeah.

61
00:05:12,615 --> 00:05:12,795
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

62
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:14,328
[SPEAKER_01]: PS3, PS4, PS5, PS6, PS7, PS8, PS9, PS10

63
00:05:37,063 --> 00:05:44,126
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to be seeing most of these coming out in the more expensive bundle, but I think a lot of people are going to be getting the more expensive one anyway.

64
00:05:44,146 --> 00:05:50,869
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like how with the Xbox 360, sure they had the core one available, but people only bought it because the premium was sold out.

65
00:05:51,049 --> 00:05:54,631
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess that's their way of making more money off of this.

66
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:57,332
[SPEAKER_01]: Or losing less money, I guess.

67
00:05:57,832 --> 00:06:03,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I was kind of bitter when the only Xbox 360 I could get was a core, because they were making it seem like half and half.

68
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:09,421
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think they know that more people want the premiums because the cores are kind of a joke, just like they were with 360 in my opinion.

69
00:06:09,521 --> 00:06:15,223
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be shortages because they're only going to have, what, 400,000 units to launch with North America.

70
00:06:15,763 --> 00:06:19,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I ain't buying one until at least 2007, so there you go.

71
00:06:19,644 --> 00:06:21,045
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one more free on the market.

72
00:06:21,085 --> 00:06:21,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Have fun.

73
00:06:21,565 --> 00:06:26,187
[SPEAKER_01]: At least with the Wii, they're promising 4 million units by the end of the year, most of which are coming to the United States.

74
00:06:26,947 --> 00:06:31,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I hope they make good on that or else it better not be the 360 all over again.

75
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:32,369
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see.

76
00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:42,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, in other news, this actually has to do with the Xbox 360 and some UK news.

77
00:06:43,756 --> 00:06:49,421
[SPEAKER_06]: There is going to be a free week of Xbox Live for our friends overseas.

78
00:06:51,602 --> 00:07:00,870
[SPEAKER_06]: It's stating that you'll actually be able to use the services starting on...

79
00:07:03,508 --> 00:07:12,812
[SPEAKER_06]: 20th November I'm sorry, 20th September, my apologies.

80
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:13,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn it!

81
00:07:14,593 --> 00:07:14,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey!

82
00:07:14,953 --> 00:07:15,753
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a different song.

83
00:07:17,834 --> 00:07:18,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me.

84
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:20,595
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll ferret you.

85
00:07:23,096 --> 00:07:25,817
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not my fault you can't tell your September from your November, okay?

86
00:07:26,017 --> 00:07:27,178
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to throw my hat at you.

87
00:07:27,498 --> 00:07:29,298
[SPEAKER_01]: If only Nintendo would make that mistake.

88
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Back to the news.

89
00:07:34,097 --> 00:07:42,542
[SPEAKER_06]: On the 20th of September, Xbox Live will be free to our friends in Europe.

90
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:43,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Free access.

91
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,224
[SPEAKER_06]: And it ends on the 29th.

92
00:07:48,705 --> 00:07:51,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, it will be at 11.59pm.

93
00:07:51,507 --> 00:07:52,568
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's UK time.

94
00:07:53,388 --> 00:07:58,251
[SPEAKER_03]: So get in all that laggy, scramble Xbox Live action while you can.

95
00:07:58,671 --> 00:08:00,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I played it online and it's laggy.

96
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:01,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Well...

97
00:08:02,805 --> 00:08:20,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the games available right now, just to give a list, is Project Gotham Racing 3, Top Spin 2, Table Tennis, Saints Row, World Cup Soccer, Dark Zero, I'm sorry, Perfect Dark Zero, Street Fighter 2, Hyper Fighting Edition, Texas Hold'em.

98
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:21,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, you know what?

99
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Log on, play Uno with us.

100
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we could do it.

101
00:08:25,351 --> 00:08:30,912
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be a good way for us to meet some UK listeners, except one of us is going to have to be awake at a god-awful hour for that to happen.

102
00:08:31,618 --> 00:08:32,379
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

103
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:09,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Rare, of course, was responsible for a lot of the launch titles, or a couple of launch titles, I should say, for the Xbox 360.

104
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:10,286
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, no, I take that back.

105
00:09:10,306 --> 00:09:11,126
[SPEAKER_01]: There were only one title.

106
00:09:11,427 --> 00:09:28,138
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, they had a launch title for the 360, Perfect Dark Zero, and now, of course, I'm going to be announcing some more titles at X06, which is later this month, including, well, some thoughts at least, Banjo-3, or Killer Instinct, or some of the...

107
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:30,769
[SPEAKER_01]: BlackWolf is saying, skip four, you tit!

108
00:10:01,627 --> 00:10:03,607
[SPEAKER_03]: and he also said, draw for you, bloody bloke!

109
00:10:04,908 --> 00:10:07,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever, that was my worst British accent ever, by the way.

110
00:10:08,568 --> 00:10:09,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sorry, I won't do that again.

111
00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:10,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, UK folks.

112
00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:11,889
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize.

113
00:10:12,289 --> 00:10:13,970
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize to the entire United Kingdom.

114
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:15,790
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's right.

115
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:20,991
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew it was a couple, and I have to go and correct myself again.

116
00:10:22,031 --> 00:10:26,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on to another story, Final Fantasy XII, something about the current gen systems.

117
00:10:26,952 --> 00:10:29,693
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we've had a lot of next gen news, but something about the current gen systems.

118
00:10:30,211 --> 00:10:34,974
[SPEAKER_03]: They're actually going to be having a whole day to celebrate Final Fantasy XII in New York City.

119
00:10:35,855 --> 00:10:45,680
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's going on is that on October 12th through October 15th at the Digital Life Expo, Final Fantasy XII will be appearing at the event.

120
00:10:46,321 --> 00:10:46,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

121
00:10:46,841 --> 00:10:50,783
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know we have a lot of fans there at New York City that want to check that out.

122
00:10:51,164 --> 00:10:53,225
[SPEAKER_03]: However, here's the other part you should check out.

123
00:10:53,627 --> 00:10:58,631
[SPEAKER_03]: October 11th is Final Fantasy XII Day, and that has been declared by New York City.

124
00:10:58,852 --> 00:11:01,354
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be a special commemoration in Times Square.

125
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:04,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Cosplayers will be abounding, I'm sure.

126
00:11:06,378 --> 00:11:09,901
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see why people are making such a big deal out of something that's such a crap game.

127
00:11:10,141 --> 00:11:11,563
[SPEAKER_03]: You haven't even played it yet, have you?

128
00:11:11,603 --> 00:11:12,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I have.

129
00:11:12,904 --> 00:11:13,604
[SPEAKER_03]: It's incredible.

130
00:11:14,305 --> 00:11:14,505
[SPEAKER_06]: The demo?

131
00:11:14,525 --> 00:11:15,246
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be incredible.

132
00:11:16,487 --> 00:11:16,787
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

133
00:11:16,887 --> 00:11:18,429
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to play my game by myself.

134
00:11:19,449 --> 00:11:21,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we'll just see when the full version comes out.

135
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:23,807
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still going to get it.

136
00:11:24,047 --> 00:11:25,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you see, fangirl.

137
00:11:25,747 --> 00:11:28,689
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm using Megzi's excuse.

138
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:29,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Metal box.

139
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:33,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Special edition.

140
00:11:34,451 --> 00:11:35,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, special stuff.

141
00:11:36,012 --> 00:11:36,312
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

142
00:11:38,412 --> 00:11:39,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

143
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:46,896
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, one thing that I think a lot of us will be happy about, especially a certain somebody sitting by my foot,

144
00:11:48,610 --> 00:12:13,643
[SPEAKER_06]: is Kingdom Hearts 2 is getting an international version in Japan we're getting Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix which a couple of us who pay attention to our live journals have seen pictures of because somebody posted a scan from a magazine of a certain somebody who was in a mask in the bonus clip for Kingdom Hearts 2 oh so this game will actually have an ending that makes sense?

145
00:12:15,065 --> 00:12:15,945
[SPEAKER_06]: It made sense!

146
00:12:16,045 --> 00:12:16,646
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just messing.

147
00:12:16,866 --> 00:12:21,409
[SPEAKER_06]: But from what that picture indicated, it's going to give us more of that little clip.

148
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:32,377
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care if I'm spoiling now, but if you get the perfect ending for Kingdom Hearts 2, you get a little clip of three armored figures picking up Keyblades.

149
00:12:32,777 --> 00:12:34,779
[SPEAKER_07]: YouTube is amazing!

150
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:39,402
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a bajillion other Keyblades, like a graveyard, around them.

151
00:12:40,032 --> 00:13:09,384
[SPEAKER_06]: and apparently they're going to have more of that in the ending you know how there was the deep dive in the last Kingdom Hearts but they're also saying that they're going to be incorporating the card battle the card battle system from Chain of Memories it didn't give a lot of detail again I saw the ad for this I've seen the article they showed it like they actually showed I think the Sephiroth battle on this picture and I'll have to find out who it was on my friends list that posted the article

152
00:13:09,961 --> 00:13:37,409
[SPEAKER_06]: but it had the little card icons in the side and you draw your cards and play them out like Chain of Memories but it looked really neat another point is that they are getting all the English voices so hey importers be happy you too can own this game and play it in an understandable language unless you are fluent in Japanese and then you won't have a problem anyway

153
00:13:39,005 --> 00:13:40,126
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay, Japanese!

154
00:13:41,366 --> 00:13:41,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways.

155
00:13:43,387 --> 00:13:47,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of stuff coming out in Japan, well, this is more, of course, for the U.S.

156
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:51,671
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some release dates for you, including the stuff that's coming out this week.

157
00:13:52,371 --> 00:13:53,912
[SPEAKER_01]: And lots of good stuff, of course.

[SPEAKER_01]: Okami is going to be finally making its way out here.

160
00:14:00,575 --> 00:14:02,276
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, very anticipated game.

161
00:14:02,296 --> 00:14:03,356
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about fucking time.

162
00:14:03,636 --> 00:14:04,177
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

163
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:09,522
[SPEAKER_03]: I will talk with my mouth full whenever I want.

164
00:14:09,542 --> 00:14:12,364
[SPEAKER_03]: I am one of the hosts of this podcast, goddammit.

[SPEAKER_03]: Okie dokie, anyways.

166
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:16,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I was yelling at Chris for trying to be my mommy.

00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:23,074
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, um, no, we're going to be getting some other stuff, including, uh, well,

170
00:14:45,796 --> 00:14:47,157
[SPEAKER_01]: Why you would buy that one, I don't know.

171
00:14:48,498 --> 00:14:53,523
[SPEAKER_01]: Dragon Quest Heroes Rocket Slime is going to be making its way to the DS, which is pretty awesome.

172
00:14:53,543 --> 00:15:07,455
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a fan of Sierra games, there's going to be some PC compilations coming out for you, including the King's Quest compilation, Leisure Suit Larry compilation, Police Quest, Space Quest, and yeah, those will be the compilations for you.

173
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:08,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Hot!

174
00:15:09,172 --> 00:15:12,936
[SPEAKER_01]: Samurai Warriors 2 on the 360 and PlayStation 2 are going to be coming out.

175
00:15:13,736 --> 00:15:24,165
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have some stuff for the 360, you're looking to pick up some games, well, The Godfather is going to be coming out for you, as well as, well, not really a game, but the Xbox Live Vision Camera, as we mentioned earlier.

176
00:15:26,287 --> 00:15:26,868
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see here.

177
00:15:26,908 --> 00:15:31,312
[SPEAKER_01]: World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions, which is also on PSP and PlayStation 2.

178
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:32,573
[SPEAKER_01]: And...

179
00:15:34,545 --> 00:15:37,086
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually, I might pick this up because it looks funny.

180
00:15:37,366 --> 00:15:44,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Kabbalah's Alaskan Adventure, you know, all that ice fishing and hunting polar bears on HD there.

181
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:48,850
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, no Africa on ice, okay.

182
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:55,673
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, on the Game Boy Advance, Capcom Classics, Minimix will be making its way out there.

00:15:56,173 --> 00:16:02,055
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you really buy everything for the Game Boy Advance, Fashion Dogs, where you can dress up dogs on the Game Boy Advance.

184
00:16:02,483 --> 00:16:04,625
[SPEAKER_06]: There are people who do that for real though, that's sad.

185
00:16:05,485 --> 00:16:07,947
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're one of those people, never mind.

186
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Please stop listening to OLR.

187
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:15,633
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, King of Fighters 2006, I'm sorry, was also making its way in Godfather Mob Wars.

188
00:16:15,873 --> 00:16:16,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Much better.

189
00:16:16,914 --> 00:16:24,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, as for our friends overseas in Europe, by the way, Suikoden V came out yesterday, so get it.

190
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:29,043
[SPEAKER_06]: But on the 21st, Jaws Unleashed, yay.

191
00:16:29,404 --> 00:16:29,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.

192
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,522
[SPEAKER_06]: and then on the 22nd, FIFA 07 is coming out for everything.

193
00:16:34,323 --> 00:16:35,063
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not kidding.

194
00:16:35,143 --> 00:16:39,105
[SPEAKER_06]: It is coming out for damn near everything, including, you know, Nintendo Virtual Boy.

195
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:40,546
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kidding.

196
00:16:42,527 --> 00:16:43,308
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a Virtual Boy.

197
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,311
[SPEAKER_06]: How can you still play your Virtual Boy?

198
00:16:48,391 --> 00:16:50,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that just the biggest migraine maker ever?

199
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:52,573
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like it.

200
00:16:53,474 --> 00:16:55,055
[SPEAKER_00]: I still play Teleroboxer, damn it.

201
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:56,175
[SPEAKER_00]: Freak.

202
00:16:56,756 --> 00:16:56,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

203
00:16:58,202 --> 00:17:19,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Also coming out is Guilty Gear Dust Strikers for the DS, Jaws Unleashed on the Xbox, which I don't know why it's not coming out on the 21st with the other versions, Just Cause on Xbox 360, NHL Eastside Hockey Manager 2007 on PC, Pyroworld on PC, and Saint Seiya The Hades on PlayStation 2.

204
00:17:21,021 --> 00:17:25,304
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad you get it as Saint Seiya, not as like Warriors of the Zodiac, which is stupid.

205
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Harukanaru Jikunokare Maiichiya

206
00:17:42,682 --> 00:17:43,542
[SPEAKER_03]: NHL 06, Rugby 06, Midway Arcade Treasures

207
00:18:03,075 --> 00:18:04,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Translated in Japanese.

208
00:18:04,395 --> 00:18:08,337
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess it's a way for them to play some of the games that were really big here in America years ago.

209
00:18:08,677 --> 00:18:13,338
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of neat to see a four-year-old game getting translated for a Japanese audience.

210
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,119
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a lot of them were already out in Japan, though.

211
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:18,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, especially in arcade format.

212
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,622
[SPEAKER_03]: But some of the games, I kind of see because not all the games that were popular here were popular there and so on.

213
00:18:23,842 --> 00:18:26,683
[SPEAKER_03]: I imagine Mortal Kombat was probably bigger here than it was there.

214
00:18:26,723 --> 00:18:27,783
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.

215
00:18:27,923 --> 00:18:30,104
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't in Japan in the mid-90s, so I don't know.

216
00:18:31,305 --> 00:18:32,685
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's what you have to look forward to this week.

217
00:18:33,151 --> 00:18:35,034
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait a minute, though!

218
00:18:35,074 --> 00:18:36,295
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait a minute, though!

219
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,637
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember when they tried the 64...

220
00:18:50,507 --> 00:18:53,349
[SPEAKER_03]: When have you ever seen an SNK machine at an arcade?

221
00:18:53,450 --> 00:19:03,098
[SPEAKER_03]: I always see these SNK machines at frickin' pizza parlors, and I saw one at the supermarket and one at Jim Boy's Tacos, okay?

222
00:19:03,438 --> 00:19:05,800
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a six-slot MBS at my arcade.

223
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Those SNK machines show up in the craziest fuckin' places.

224
00:19:08,922 --> 00:19:12,085
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had one of the big-screen TV ones for Summer Showdown 3.

225
00:19:12,305 --> 00:19:13,066
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw one in a 7-Eleven.

226
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:16,188
[SPEAKER_06]: However, Summer Showdown 4 has a signal that resets those TVs.

227
00:19:16,228 --> 00:19:16,769
[SPEAKER_06]: It turns them off.

228
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, anywho...

229
00:19:47,768 --> 00:19:58,856
[SPEAKER_01]: and Regulation A is actually based on the 3D home console fighting series by the same name and at least includes one new character, Ash Crimson.

230
00:19:59,537 --> 00:20:02,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, Ash Crimson is such a generic sounding name.

231
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:07,963
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, he's from King of Fires 03 and King of Fires 11.

232
00:20:09,624 --> 00:20:12,526
[SPEAKER_01]: Samurai Spirit Sen also play as a 3D game.

233
00:20:12,566 --> 00:20:16,169
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be the second time the sword fighting series has made its way in the arcade in 3D.

234
00:20:17,562 --> 00:20:30,614
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other one that remembers King of Fighters 64 The only good thing about that game was bringing in, what's your name that had the two swords?

235
00:20:31,775 --> 00:20:36,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Psycho Girl This is also, they announced that they're going to be releasing King of Fighters 12 on the new hardware too

236
00:20:42,185 --> 00:20:44,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Goddamn, make a new game, SNK.

237
00:20:44,546 --> 00:20:45,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Make a new fucking game.

238
00:20:46,146 --> 00:20:47,927
[SPEAKER_00]: Give us Godot Mark of the Wolves 2.

239
00:20:48,307 --> 00:20:49,527
[SPEAKER_00]: Give us Last Blade 3.

240
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:50,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Give us a new game.

241
00:20:51,008 --> 00:20:51,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Give us a new series game.

242
00:20:51,728 --> 00:20:53,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Give us Last Blade 3, please.

243
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,449
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, God, I'm done.

244
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:56,169
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God, I love Last Blade 3.

245
00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:01,311
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob, aren't you looking forward to the Metal Slug anthology that's going to be on the Wii?

246
00:21:01,391 --> 00:21:06,233
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait to play Metal Slug 413, which is like the same graphics for Metal Slug 1.

247
00:21:06,273 --> 00:21:09,894
[SPEAKER_06]: I could play Metal Slug all day because it's all about... Okay, and King of Fighters 2007.

248
00:21:10,734 --> 00:21:11,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

249
00:21:11,314 --> 00:21:11,675
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't SNK.

250
00:21:11,715 --> 00:21:12,095
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

251
00:21:39,227 --> 00:21:41,028
[SPEAKER_03]: That was on all the freaking machines, wasn't it?

252
00:21:41,249 --> 00:21:42,769
[SPEAKER_00]: Play more SNK now.

253
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:43,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

254
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:46,972
[SPEAKER_00]: But why are they porting a shitty game like Maximum Impact?

255
00:21:48,393 --> 00:21:49,994
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't like it here in America.

256
00:21:50,134 --> 00:21:51,474
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't like it there in Japan.

257
00:21:51,915 --> 00:21:53,075
[SPEAKER_00]: The voiceovers suck.

258
00:21:53,836 --> 00:21:56,117
[SPEAKER_00]: Port a decent game to arcades.

259
00:21:59,939 --> 00:22:06,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, as far as hopefully, and I would hope with 573 titles, something good will have to be among them.

260
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:07,158
[SPEAKER_03]: E3 probably has more.

261
00:22:36,445 --> 00:22:38,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Konami will own Tokyo Game Show.

262
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:41,250
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm wondering, when are we going to get WTF?

263
00:22:42,872 --> 00:22:43,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't they change the name of that?

264
00:22:43,973 --> 00:22:44,493
[SPEAKER_01]: They did.

265
00:22:44,673 --> 00:22:46,075
[SPEAKER_01]: They changed it and they changed it back.

266
00:22:46,295 --> 00:22:48,477
[SPEAKER_01]: WTF is coming out in October.

267
00:22:48,637 --> 00:22:49,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Work time fun.

268
00:22:49,698 --> 00:22:50,219
[SPEAKER_01]: Good for them.

269
00:22:50,979 --> 00:23:18,745
[SPEAKER_06]: but there are actually a lot of games for PC, mobile phone games they're actually saying for PC and mobile phone they had 252 titles for portables DS will be bringing 52 PSP will have 33 18 Playstation 3 games are going to show and they'll probably all still suck and play on rack mounted servers and 20 games coming out for Xbox 360 but they're only showing 5 for the Wii Wii is holding out

270
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:37,986
[SPEAKER_06]: The ones that they are actually going to be putting on is the Bleach game, Shiraha Kirameku Rinbu Kyoku, Marvelous Interactives, Bokujo Monogatari Wi, which is still a working title, and Elebits.

271
00:23:39,266 --> 00:23:40,626
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't say if it's going to be playable or not.

272
00:23:42,827 --> 00:23:45,648
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually, they do list a lot of the games.

273
00:23:45,993 --> 00:23:46,553
[SPEAKER_03]: T for Teen

274
00:24:15,075 --> 00:24:23,707
[SPEAKER_03]: T for Teen Crude Humor, Violence, Sexual Themes, Language, and Use of Alcohol and Tobacco

276
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:56,556
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been delayed forever.

277
00:24:56,576 --> 00:25:00,858
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be honest, some of the other Rockstar games, not Grand Theft Auto, have been pretty good.

278
00:25:00,898 --> 00:25:04,421
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Warriors was pretty fun for a while, and then I got bored with it.

279
00:25:04,781 --> 00:25:10,484
[SPEAKER_01]: But Bully looks pretty fun, and they've got a really good system for all the classes and stuff that you have to take.

280
00:25:11,005 --> 00:25:12,786
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of minigames and stuff involved with that.

281
00:25:12,826 --> 00:25:14,567
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it'll be pretty good if you give it a chance.

282
00:25:16,228 --> 00:25:16,528
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

283
00:25:16,628 --> 00:25:18,249
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to wait until it comes out, I guess.

284
00:25:18,589 --> 00:25:21,291
[SPEAKER_03]: ActDeft in our chatroom says, Jack Thompson will sue.

285
00:25:21,971 --> 00:25:24,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Jack Thompson's stupid, and it doesn't have anything to do with, you know,

286
00:25:25,209 --> 00:25:28,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, so he's going to complain about this game.

287
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,270
[SPEAKER_01]: Play the damn game, you'll see that there's nothing.

288
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:35,311
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even think it has much to do with bullying people, to be honest, if you actually play the game.

289
00:25:35,871 --> 00:25:41,952
[SPEAKER_03]: OLArmyEddy says, sexual themes, usually that's an automatic M. Not necessarily.

290
00:25:42,312 --> 00:25:46,413
[SPEAKER_03]: It could just be a chick dancing in her bra or something.

291
00:25:46,433 --> 00:25:48,473
[SPEAKER_03]: That might not be M, but it might be a little bit, you know.

292
00:25:49,733 --> 00:25:54,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Not to bring this up again, but they have sexual themes in The Sims 2, and that's rated T.

293
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:56,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it has woohoo.

294
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:59,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially if you get the special furniture with the sex animations.

295
00:25:59,032 --> 00:26:02,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, woohoo in, I think, on the couch.

296
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:04,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Woohoo in the bed, woohoo in the hot tub, and then something else.

297
00:26:06,715 --> 00:26:07,535
[SPEAKER_01]: Woohoo indeed.

298
00:26:08,095 --> 00:26:11,237
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendo should have come out with a system called the woohoo.

299
00:26:11,377 --> 00:26:18,239
[SPEAKER_06]: The old Sims, the first Sims game actually had someone programmed a countertop that you could... Woohoo on.

300
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:19,180
[SPEAKER_06]: With full animations.

301
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

302
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,241
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, woohoo indeed.

303
00:26:21,261 --> 00:26:22,441
[SPEAKER_06]: But hey, online content may change.

304
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:23,301
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways.

305
00:26:24,242 --> 00:26:24,402
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

306
00:26:26,524 --> 00:26:41,093
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking about, you know, some stuff that people think that games like Bully Cause, well, there was a shooter in Montreal that went and killed a bunch of people in his school, and guess what they found as one of his favorite games?

307
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:48,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently this guy plays a lot of games, including one that happens to be Super Columbine Massacre RPG.

308
00:26:48,877 --> 00:26:53,700
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, not the sequel to Super Mario RPG, just to clear that up for you.

309
00:26:54,801 --> 00:26:55,841
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, I wasn't sure.

310
00:27:19,045 --> 00:27:20,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you see the videos of him on CNN?

311
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:45,861
[SPEAKER_06]: A real gamer would have been that crazy.

312
00:27:46,201 --> 00:27:47,242
[SPEAKER_06]: He was nuts.

313
00:27:47,302 --> 00:27:49,344
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's all the game's fault.

314
00:27:49,424 --> 00:27:51,045
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about the game.

315
00:27:51,105 --> 00:27:52,727
[SPEAKER_06]: What did the game do to him?

316
00:27:52,747 --> 00:27:55,609
[SPEAKER_06]: I blame his psychosis and his parents for not being more observant.

317
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:57,911
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it was his favorite game, but you know what?

318
00:27:57,951 --> 00:28:04,617
[SPEAKER_01]: When you see that, of course, if you're going to be trying to spin this in the news, that's going to get the most attention.

319
00:28:04,758 --> 00:28:06,659
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's, of course, blame it on the games.

320
00:28:06,859 --> 00:28:08,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Naturally, lots of feedback from our viewers.

321
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:09,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

322
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:11,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat room over at orangeentrainer.com.

323
00:28:11,381 --> 00:28:11,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Click on chat.

324
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:16,325
[SPEAKER_03]: OL Army Eddie says, Super Columbine RPG does not glorify school shootings at all.

325
00:28:17,846 --> 00:28:18,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

326
00:28:18,967 --> 00:28:19,927
[SPEAKER_03]: I always butcher this name.

327
00:28:19,947 --> 00:28:20,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, help me.

328
00:28:20,508 --> 00:28:21,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Nazgul Slayer?

329
00:28:21,589 --> 00:28:22,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Nazgul?

330
00:28:22,269 --> 00:28:22,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Nazgul.

331
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:23,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn it.

332
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,151
[SPEAKER_03]: That one fucks me up.

333
00:28:26,132 --> 00:28:31,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Nazgul Slayer says, he used RPG Maker 2000 to make Super Columbine Massacre.

334
00:28:31,136 --> 00:28:32,117
[SPEAKER_03]: I read an article about it.

335
00:28:32,397 --> 00:28:34,739
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not really Super Columbine Massacre that's the problem.

336
00:28:35,019 --> 00:28:37,741
[SPEAKER_03]: It's RPG Maker, the devil's game.

337
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,800
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

338
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,421
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm attacking the darkness.

339
00:28:42,761 --> 00:28:44,201
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm using magic missiles.

340
00:28:44,261 --> 00:28:45,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any Mountain Dew?

341
00:28:45,621 --> 00:28:49,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Socorino would like to point out, also, his gun was legal, but his clips weren't.

342
00:28:51,242 --> 00:28:52,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm, interesting.

343
00:28:52,623 --> 00:28:53,083
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

344
00:28:55,283 --> 00:29:04,985
[SPEAKER_06]: This is, it just further illustrates that society is more ready to look for a scapegoat than actually treat the true root of the problem.

345
00:29:05,697 --> 00:29:07,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Do these kind of stories make you angry, DarkSakura?

346
00:29:07,758 --> 00:29:08,919
[SPEAKER_06]: They make me furious.

347
00:29:09,219 --> 00:29:09,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Livid.

348
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Ludicrously livid.

349
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they make you want to rant a little bit?

350
00:29:12,821 --> 00:29:14,782
[SPEAKER_06]: They make me want to go to a school and shoot people.

351
00:29:15,062 --> 00:29:23,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it wouldn't be episode... It wouldn't be episode 200 of a podcast without... The Fuse of the Week.

352
00:29:23,626 --> 00:29:24,346
[SPEAKER_03]: My, uh...

353
00:29:36,133 --> 00:30:05,539
[SPEAKER_06]: FU of the week I can't believe I completely blamed I had what my FU was going to be and it wasn't related to traffic at all wow my FU of the week goes toward the Japantown Anime Festival oh my god crappiest convention ever well to you know in their defense they were pretty small I mean but still hey that's not nice talking about the Japanese being small okay

354
00:30:06,303 --> 00:30:08,184
[SPEAKER_04]: This was my... You're Pokemon!

355
00:30:08,204 --> 00:30:09,205
[SPEAKER_04]: You connect all to Pokemon!

356
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:10,225
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's not nice.

357
00:30:10,325 --> 00:30:11,145
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand.

358
00:30:11,946 --> 00:30:16,408
[SPEAKER_06]: My problem with it being is that... No, this is in San Francisco, by the way.

359
00:30:17,129 --> 00:30:25,533
[SPEAKER_06]: My problem with it was that it suffered the same problem that AX started to suffer as in being spread across different areas.

360
00:30:25,953 --> 00:30:34,557
[SPEAKER_06]: You had to do... You had to go from one mall to the other, into the hotel, into the courtyard downstairs under Kinozumiya at Kintetsu Mall.

361
00:30:35,418 --> 00:30:35,578
[SPEAKER_06]: But...

362
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,702
[SPEAKER_06]: They had a pretty good band that we were there for listening to the warm-up.

363
00:30:38,722 --> 00:30:39,663
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually sounded pretty cool.

364
00:30:39,683 --> 00:30:42,265
[SPEAKER_06]: But the dealer's room, it was a dealer's closet.

365
00:30:42,585 --> 00:30:43,245
[SPEAKER_06]: The closet!

366
00:30:44,746 --> 00:30:46,768
[SPEAKER_04]: And they had some interesting stuff, some nice stuff.

367
00:30:46,868 --> 00:30:51,772
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, overall it was pretty much what you could find online pretty easily.

368
00:30:51,792 --> 00:30:54,514
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I was most disappointed with was the cosplay.

369
00:30:55,915 --> 00:31:00,819
[SPEAKER_06]: I expected to go and see people taking advantage of the opportunity to cosplay.

370
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:02,180
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a pretty big Naruto group.

371
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,361
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a pretty big Bleach group.

372
00:31:05,206 --> 00:31:06,267
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been done.

373
00:31:06,848 --> 00:31:08,269
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been done, yeah.

374
00:31:08,689 --> 00:31:10,150
[SPEAKER_06]: I could go see that at any other convention.

375
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:11,371
[SPEAKER_06]: We did meet lots of nice people.

376
00:31:11,832 --> 00:31:16,555
[SPEAKER_06]: We met some people on DA, on DeviantArt, who were really cool.

377
00:31:17,136 --> 00:31:24,402
[SPEAKER_06]: But overall, I think I had a higher expectation for it just because of how it was played up there, having all this different stuff go on.

378
00:31:24,942 --> 00:31:28,805
[SPEAKER_06]: And it really was just blah.

379
00:31:30,266 --> 00:31:33,489
[SPEAKER_06]: The only advantage of it is that our badges gave us discounts at the stores.

380
00:31:34,448 --> 00:31:35,268
[SPEAKER_06]: So I could buy porn.

381
00:31:35,909 --> 00:31:36,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Porn.

382
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,831
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought some Yelly.

383
00:31:40,471 --> 00:31:41,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Loki.

384
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:43,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Your FU's of the week.

385
00:31:43,913 --> 00:31:45,174
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine don't have to do with porn.

386
00:31:46,235 --> 00:31:47,475
[SPEAKER_01]: FU to Wicker Man.

387
00:31:47,716 --> 00:31:48,316
[SPEAKER_01]: That movie.

388
00:31:49,076 --> 00:31:51,638
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did they have to kill Nicolas Cage's character off?

389
00:31:51,678 --> 00:31:53,159
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was getting good.

390
00:31:53,499 --> 00:31:58,542
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, the whole movie was kind of like, eh, okay, this whole island with... Wow, thanks for saving me ten bucks!

391
00:32:00,128 --> 00:32:02,109
[SPEAKER_06]: And isn't that how the original ended?

392
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:03,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, but I'll get to that.

393
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:05,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so here's the thing.

394
00:32:05,571 --> 00:32:07,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did they have to kill his character off?

395
00:32:07,112 --> 00:32:07,993
[SPEAKER_01]: It started getting good.

396
00:32:08,033 --> 00:32:10,194
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he punched a woman in the face.

397
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:12,455
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, god damn, this movie's gonna be awesome.

398
00:32:12,495 --> 00:32:15,457
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, fucking, oh god, I can't remember her name.

399
00:32:15,477 --> 00:32:16,938
[SPEAKER_01]: The chick from...

400
00:32:17,578 --> 00:32:18,158
[SPEAKER_01]: The Burning Man?

401
00:32:47,051 --> 00:32:52,653
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this whole, the whole movie reminded me of Burning Man, like, in Seattle or something, you know, it's like, alright.

402
00:32:53,393 --> 00:32:59,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, my FU of the week goes to my iPod, which upon boot up today gave me a frowny face of death.

403
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:13,480
[SPEAKER_03]: I blame iTunes 7, because ever since I installed iTunes 7, that thing started acting weird, like, iTunes did not want to talk to my old-ass, you know, fourth-gen iPod or whatever it is, the black and white before they were color iPods, so...

404
00:33:14,219 --> 00:33:18,340
[SPEAKER_03]: FU iTunes 7 for ruining my iPod and now I can't listen to podcasts in my car.

405
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:26,902
[SPEAKER_03]: So, no Bobby, no All Games, no other podcasts I listen to or OLR in my car for a while until I can afford the video iPod.

406
00:33:28,062 --> 00:33:29,503
[SPEAKER_03]: So, FU frowny face of death.

407
00:33:30,663 --> 00:33:31,383
[SPEAKER_03]: I blame Apple.

408
00:33:31,923 --> 00:33:33,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, just bite your tongue.

409
00:33:34,384 --> 00:33:36,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris, how about... I blame the lack of Rockbox.

410
00:33:36,485 --> 00:33:38,565
[SPEAKER_03]: How about your... Oh, okay, Drew Nami, your FUs of the week.

411
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:42,266
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, first off, FU to Missing Class for an entire week.

412
00:33:42,915 --> 00:33:44,716
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the thought, but tried it.

413
00:34:13,894 --> 00:34:19,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, for lack of anything better, my FU of the week is to my bed at home.

414
00:34:20,798 --> 00:34:24,800
[SPEAKER_04]: It, for some reason, thinks that I need to be molested in the middle of the night.

415
00:34:26,721 --> 00:34:27,801
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of bed is this?

416
00:34:27,861 --> 00:34:28,662
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to buy one.

417
00:34:29,802 --> 00:34:30,783
[SPEAKER_04]: IKEA, actually.

418
00:34:31,103 --> 00:34:31,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright!

419
00:34:31,823 --> 00:34:35,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, there is only one bed... God, I love Sweden.

420
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I never let any of my friends... Abba and molesting beds.

421
00:34:41,482 --> 00:34:42,703
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't get much better than that.

422
00:34:42,863 --> 00:34:44,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to hear my story or not?

423
00:34:44,244 --> 00:34:46,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

424
00:34:47,045 --> 00:34:54,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, there's only one other bed that's available in my house when my friends come over, and that's the one my dad and his girlfriend use, so they have to sleep in my bed.

425
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:58,932
[SPEAKER_04]: And twice I've woken up to my friends trying to molest me.

426
00:34:59,632 --> 00:35:03,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie slept in there last night, and she was all trying to pet my chest.

427
00:35:06,196 --> 00:35:07,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I was having a dream.

428
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,721
[SPEAKER_03]: This show just got a lot hotter.

429
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:18,204
[SPEAKER_06]: I was having a dream about a couple of characters, and they were just sleeping in the bed.

430
00:35:18,224 --> 00:35:18,904
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a cat there.

431
00:35:18,924 --> 00:35:21,425
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is what Shermie does.

432
00:35:21,985 --> 00:35:25,287
[SPEAKER_06]: She'll crawl in the bed between me and Dan, and I'll reach over and pet her.

433
00:35:26,007 --> 00:35:34,951
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the dream, I guess the character there in my dream was reaching over to pet the cat, and I opened my eyes to see my hand hovering over Kristen's chest.

434
00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:36,632
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, oh, you're not a cat.

435
00:35:38,078 --> 00:35:40,619
[SPEAKER_04]: That was Marissa's reaction, except she said, oh, you don't have a penis.

436
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:50,843
[SPEAKER_04]: She thought my friend Marissa came down a few weekends ago and she thought I was her boyfriend, Christopher, and was all rubbing my back.

437
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:54,404
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's like, oh, wait, you don't have a penis, and turned over and fell asleep.

438
00:35:55,205 --> 00:35:56,645
[SPEAKER_04]: So people want to molest me in my bed.

439
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:58,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Dot, dot, dot.

440
00:35:58,646 --> 00:36:03,368
[SPEAKER_06]: And to respond to Jeremy Todd, I have had a hot lesbian dream about Angelina Jolie.

441
00:36:03,508 --> 00:36:03,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

442
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,401
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I've had a hot lesbian dream about Angelina Jolie, actually.

443
00:36:09,181 --> 00:36:10,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Who hasn't had a hot lesbian dream about her?

444
00:36:10,901 --> 00:36:13,402
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not kidding either, and I also had one about Billy Piper.

445
00:36:13,662 --> 00:36:14,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, anyway.

446
00:36:17,082 --> 00:36:18,603
[SPEAKER_06]: The one who played Rose in Doctor Who.

447
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:20,183
[SPEAKER_06]: She's pretty!

448
00:36:22,343 --> 00:36:23,743
[SPEAKER_03]: We've lost control here on episode 200.

449
00:36:24,764 --> 00:36:29,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, we had a story earlier in the program about Final Fantasy XII and Final Fantasy XII Day.

450
00:36:29,485 --> 00:36:32,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe there'll be two Final Fantasy XII Days, because guess what?

451
00:36:32,534 --> 00:36:36,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings

452
00:37:03,188 --> 00:37:08,090
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

453
00:37:30,256 --> 00:37:33,497
[SPEAKER_06]: This one is a very special one, especially for episode 200.

454
00:37:34,117 --> 00:37:41,220
[SPEAKER_06]: The website of the week is OrangeLoungeRadio.com You must go to our site every day, hang out on our forums.

455
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,421
[SPEAKER_06]: We are awesome.

456
00:37:42,441 --> 00:37:43,981
[SPEAKER_06]: If you find news stories, link them up there.

457
00:37:44,021 --> 00:37:47,963
[SPEAKER_06]: If we don't think it's utter crap, then we'll put it up on the board.

458
00:37:48,403 --> 00:37:49,783
[SPEAKER_06]: And you get to talk to us!

459
00:37:50,804 --> 00:37:51,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's special.

460
00:37:52,304 --> 00:37:56,346
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, I figured it's about damn time that I plug our own damn site.

461
00:37:56,806 --> 00:37:59,667
[SPEAKER_06]: So OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the site of the week.

462
00:38:00,754 --> 00:38:02,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to forget... Shameless self-promotion!

463
00:38:02,554 --> 00:38:03,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn right!

464
00:38:03,635 --> 00:38:05,575
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to forget OLR PSP.

465
00:38:06,155 --> 00:38:06,916
[SPEAKER_06]: OLR PSP.

466
00:38:07,096 --> 00:38:09,196
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can go to E3 on PSP.

467
00:38:09,216 --> 00:38:10,517
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, E3 on PSP.

468
00:38:10,577 --> 00:38:14,698
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, very, very, very... It's about as updated as the OLR on PSP.

469
00:38:14,978 --> 00:38:18,679
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to see something that hasn't been updated in like five years, there's DarkSakura.com.

470
00:38:21,019 --> 00:38:23,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, haven't updated it in five years.

471
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:25,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

472
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:27,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job!

473
00:38:27,546 --> 00:38:30,487
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have our blogs at stuff.orangenounsradio.com Oh, fuck.

474
00:38:30,507 --> 00:38:31,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Those blogs haven't been updated in like a year.

475
00:38:31,827 --> 00:38:33,067
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to update mine.

476
00:38:33,087 --> 00:38:33,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, alright.

477
00:38:33,787 --> 00:38:34,127
[SPEAKER_03]: We better.

478
00:38:34,507 --> 00:38:34,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Get on that.

479
00:38:35,108 --> 00:38:35,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

480
00:38:35,468 --> 00:38:38,268
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's my Jack Thompson is a bully rant on there.

481
00:38:38,288 --> 00:38:40,229
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some good reads on there if you haven't seen it yet.

482
00:38:41,029 --> 00:38:42,389
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways.

483
00:38:42,509 --> 00:38:52,751
[SPEAKER_01]: What's kind of interesting and very disappointing to me is that it was announced this week that the PS3 controller will not be named Poos.

484
00:38:53,051 --> 00:38:57,232
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be named Sixaxis or Syaxis or whatever it's

485
00:38:57,762 --> 00:39:05,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically comes from the fact that the controller has six different axes of motion sensing.

486
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:10,848
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, since it doesn't rumble, I guess they can't really call it DualShock now, can they?

487
00:39:11,008 --> 00:39:14,930
[SPEAKER_01]: So six axes is the name of the controller.

488
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:16,230
[SPEAKER_01]: Hooray.

489
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:19,031
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also a palindrome.

490
00:39:19,532 --> 00:39:20,792
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we find this out for sure?

491
00:39:20,872 --> 00:39:22,533
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we know for sure that this is the name of it?

492
00:39:22,733 --> 00:39:27,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually, this was from a patent.

493
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:35,919
[SPEAKER_01]: or I should say a trademark that was registered and it's been pulled up and it's owned by Sony, so hurrah.

494
00:39:36,339 --> 00:39:38,160
[SPEAKER_03]: What if they're just trying a couple things out?

495
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:56,243
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true, you know, I don't know if it's for sure, but you know what, they've been, it's also been, you know, mentioned 6-axis and a few different PR things, not as, you know, it might be like the system, you know, the name for the system of the motion sensing, like for example, it says the

496
00:39:56,824 --> 00:40:11,238
[SPEAKER_01]: The controller for the PS3 employs breakthrough technology of high precision, highly sensitive 6-axis sensing system that does not require any devices other than the controller itself for seamless interactive operation.

497
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:15,802
[SPEAKER_01]: So that might be just the technology they're calling it 6-axis.

498
00:40:17,304 --> 00:40:17,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

499
00:40:18,729 --> 00:40:25,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, every week you guys write us letters, and we read them right here on Orange Lounge Radio's podcast.

500
00:40:25,933 --> 00:40:34,458
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to send us an email, it's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and when you send your email, DarkSakura suits up in her biohazard suit and puts on her rubber gloves.

501
00:40:36,589 --> 00:40:38,791
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a hazmat suit and asbestos gloves.

502
00:41:02,716 --> 00:41:03,697
[SPEAKER_06]: All you guys suck.

503
00:41:03,777 --> 00:41:04,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob is not sexy.

504
00:41:04,777 --> 00:41:05,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki is stupid.

505
00:41:05,858 --> 00:41:07,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie is a mean bitch.

506
00:41:07,539 --> 00:41:10,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Your show is full of lesbians and 30-year-old children who live in their parents' cellar.

507
00:41:11,221 --> 00:41:11,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Die!

508
00:41:12,501 --> 00:41:13,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that good enough hate mail?

509
00:41:14,543 --> 00:41:15,363
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you know I love you guys.

510
00:41:15,383 --> 00:41:15,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy 200.

511
00:41:16,183 --> 00:41:18,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris, isn't your online name DisneyButtPunk10?

512
00:41:19,325 --> 00:41:20,005
[SPEAKER_06]: DisneyButt?

513
00:41:20,025 --> 00:41:23,747
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm going to start calling you after that email.

514
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:24,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Why, yes!

515
00:41:25,348 --> 00:41:28,210
[SPEAKER_04]: As a matter of fact, DisneyPunk10 is my handle.

516
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:30,291
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an awful coincidence!

517
00:41:31,411 --> 00:41:32,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thanks for the hate mail.

518
00:41:32,592 --> 00:41:34,834
[SPEAKER_03]: We love getting hate mail at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

519
00:41:35,795 --> 00:41:36,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Bitch.

520
00:41:36,415 --> 00:41:39,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, she brings me cake.

521
00:41:39,378 --> 00:41:39,818
[SPEAKER_03]: I love her.

522
00:41:40,138 --> 00:41:40,699
[SPEAKER_06]: And donuts.

523
00:41:40,859 --> 00:41:41,800
[SPEAKER_03]: And crowns.

524
00:41:42,981 --> 00:41:43,561
[SPEAKER_03]: And crowns.

525
00:41:44,322 --> 00:41:44,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

526
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:50,788
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go parade in the living room right now while Jamie reads the next email and listen for the laughter.

527
00:41:52,649 --> 00:41:55,752
[SPEAKER_06]: You look like such a lovely princess, Rob.

528
00:41:57,153 --> 00:41:57,694
[SPEAKER_06]: And anyway...

529
00:41:59,031 --> 00:42:08,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Our next email comes from Robert M. Now that Apple has announced that you can purchase games for the iPod, what do you see becoming of this form of mobile gaming?

530
00:42:09,256 --> 00:42:16,919
[SPEAKER_06]: I may pick up Bejeweled just to see, but later it'll be interesting to see how the Units Limited controller, basically like an Atari 2600 paddle controller...

531
00:42:17,634 --> 00:42:20,955
[SPEAKER_06]: I really wonder even seeing the preview of how Pac-Man is controlled is used.

532
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:25,997
[SPEAKER_06]: I can imagine a great version of Gyruss, for instance.

533
00:42:26,437 --> 00:42:28,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, how does this open up the possibility of homebrewed games?

534
00:42:29,459 --> 00:42:36,661
[SPEAKER_06]: It's easy to make your own music and movies and play them on the iPod without ever starting an account to buy them, but what about those with skill and patience to program full games?

535
00:42:37,462 --> 00:42:38,862
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought they already had homebrewed games.

536
00:42:39,702 --> 00:42:40,703
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they had Doom on there.

537
00:42:41,323 --> 00:42:42,363
[SPEAKER_01]: For what reason, I don't know.

538
00:42:44,184 --> 00:42:45,925
[SPEAKER_03]: They said hail to the queen when I walked out there.

539
00:42:47,677 --> 00:42:48,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Bitches.

540
00:42:50,258 --> 00:42:54,098
[SPEAKER_06]: I think since they've already got it, then... Sorry, I missed the reading of the email.

541
00:42:54,118 --> 00:42:55,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Was this about the iPod games?

542
00:42:55,279 --> 00:42:55,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

543
00:42:55,559 --> 00:42:56,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, because I dug in there earlier in the week.

544
00:42:58,219 --> 00:43:00,140
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought I saw some gay in there.

545
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:01,820
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

546
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:02,920
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

547
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:06,081
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem with gaming on the iPod is that frickin' wheel.

548
00:43:07,041 --> 00:43:08,741
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's not the best controller in the world.

549
00:43:08,781 --> 00:43:13,322
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what would be great, though, is that, you know that little thing that you plug your USB thing into in the bottom?

550
00:43:13,602 --> 00:43:17,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't that be an awesome place to just jam a controller into, and then there you go.

551
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:19,350
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what Apple should do.

552
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:20,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Apple will make more money.

553
00:43:20,591 --> 00:43:21,771
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that would be a smart idea.

554
00:43:22,211 --> 00:43:25,252
[SPEAKER_03]: If Apple wanted to get into gaming on the iPod, that would be a great addition.

555
00:43:25,633 --> 00:43:26,253
[SPEAKER_03]: But what do I know?

556
00:43:26,293 --> 00:43:27,353
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just some show on the Internet.

557
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:35,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, our next email says, Dear OLR crew, I would like to say thank you for the past 1.5 years of entertainment.

558
00:43:35,576 --> 00:43:40,478
[SPEAKER_06]: I went into the gigantic list of gaming podcasts and my first random pick happened to be this wonderful podcast.

559
00:43:40,898 --> 00:43:42,578
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been listening ever since and it's been fun.

560
00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:43,819
[SPEAKER_06]: The hosts and guest hosts are great.

561
00:43:44,835 --> 00:43:54,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, this podcast introduced some of the coolest bands, Gorillaz, Freeze Pop, Games, Guitar Hero, Katamari, Websites, Gorillaz, and Official DeviantArt, and Survival Tips.

562
00:43:55,218 --> 00:43:56,398
[SPEAKER_06]: I now know how to stop a camel.

563
00:43:57,138 --> 00:44:00,319
[SPEAKER_06]: So thanks for being a part of all your listeners' life.

564
00:44:00,419 --> 00:44:02,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Reject false icons, Ion671.

565
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:03,000
[SPEAKER_06]: P.S.

566
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Come to the East Coast sometime.

567
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,001
[SPEAKER_03]: That was sweet.

568
00:44:05,081 --> 00:44:07,821
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm coming to New York City end of October.

569
00:44:08,141 --> 00:44:10,522
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to be going to the Nintendo World Store to meet fans.

570
00:44:10,742 --> 00:44:11,582
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know what day that is.

571
00:44:11,602 --> 00:44:13,563
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to go, but I'm going to YaoiCon.

572
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:14,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Hot.

573
00:44:15,581 --> 00:44:18,343
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a sweet email, thank you.

574
00:44:18,463 --> 00:44:26,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone who remembers me reading the... For anyone who wants to know where I got my survival tips from, it's the Worst Case Scenario Survival Handbook.

575
00:44:26,728 --> 00:44:29,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa, sorry, we had a snafu there.

576
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Neverending stories started playing in the background there.

577
00:44:31,512 --> 00:44:31,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, guys.

578
00:44:32,212 --> 00:44:34,274
[SPEAKER_06]: The neverending soda.

579
00:44:34,334 --> 00:44:35,034
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

580
00:44:38,396 --> 00:44:40,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Next up is Warrior Bob.

581
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:42,039
[SPEAKER_06]: That's such a cool name.

582
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:43,950
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it is.

583
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:44,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Never!

584
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:44,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Never!

585
00:45:12,369 --> 00:45:15,292
[SPEAKER_06]: But it may be a good way to get some exposure to the non-podcast audience.

586
00:45:17,134 --> 00:45:21,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Reading that again to myself, I suppose lesbian pillow fights may have a similar effect.

587
00:45:21,198 --> 00:45:22,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I didn't mean to bring that in.

588
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:24,101
[SPEAKER_04]: That was an accident.

589
00:45:25,382 --> 00:45:25,843
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's fine.

590
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:26,183
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fine.

591
00:45:27,149 --> 00:45:30,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Regardless, were it feasible, I'd definitely attend a traveling OLR show.

592
00:45:31,351 --> 00:45:34,892
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to miss the Fanime panel last spring, so I'd love to have that sort of thing happen again.

593
00:45:35,133 --> 00:45:36,633
[SPEAKER_06]: We will, by the way, be at Fanime next year.

594
00:45:36,853 --> 00:45:41,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Fanime next year, and it looks like SakuraCon is also for Seattle people.

595
00:45:41,115 --> 00:45:41,695
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be there.

596
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:45,937
[SPEAKER_03]: And possibly, at least myself, will be at one East Coast con.

597
00:45:45,977 --> 00:45:48,418
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to be doing anime cons up the butt next year.

598
00:45:48,458 --> 00:45:50,759
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to try to get to OdaCon next year, but I can't.

599
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:51,780
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

600
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:53,561
[SPEAKER_06]: But more on this.

601
00:45:54,281 --> 00:45:54,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

602
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:56,880
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to ASUN next year.

603
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:00,022
[SPEAKER_04]: And Megzi, so we can try something.

604
00:46:00,522 --> 00:46:01,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Flyer, girls!

605
00:46:01,363 --> 00:46:03,664
[SPEAKER_04]: We can walk around with a shirt or something stupid like that.

606
00:46:05,325 --> 00:46:07,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Afterwards, we'll drink Guinness and play old games.

607
00:46:07,166 --> 00:46:07,767
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be a party.

608
00:46:07,947 --> 00:46:08,507
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Guinness.

609
00:46:08,527 --> 00:46:09,087
[SPEAKER_03]: That is hot.

610
00:46:09,128 --> 00:46:10,428
[SPEAKER_03]: That is my idea of a party.

611
00:46:10,548 --> 00:46:13,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking forward to your show hitting the podcast stream, so I'll hear you then.

612
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:14,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a great night.

613
00:46:14,291 --> 00:46:15,692
[SPEAKER_06]: And relatedly, fuck Pyrite.

614
00:46:17,153 --> 00:46:17,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Amen!

615
00:46:19,005 --> 00:46:21,286
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a card-carrying OL Army member.

616
00:46:21,466 --> 00:46:22,966
[SPEAKER_01]: For a second there, I thought you said pyrite.

617
00:46:22,986 --> 00:46:24,607
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, damn that fool's gold.

618
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,187
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn it.

619
00:46:27,587 --> 00:46:30,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Pyrite is cool because it crystallizes in cube form.

620
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:33,729
[SPEAKER_06]: I took chemistry.

621
00:46:33,809 --> 00:46:34,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

622
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:37,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Science and technology.

623
00:46:38,271 --> 00:46:38,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

624
00:46:39,011 --> 00:46:39,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Science.

625
00:46:40,171 --> 00:46:42,632
[SPEAKER_04]: We should ban dihydrogen monoxide.

626
00:46:43,352 --> 00:46:46,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you know that dihydrogen monoxide is just water.

627
00:46:47,653 --> 00:46:48,474
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

628
00:46:48,494 --> 00:46:49,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't that on an episode?

629
00:46:49,094 --> 00:46:50,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Penn and Teller's bullshit.

630
00:46:50,334 --> 00:46:53,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, one of my friends was just telling me about that episode.

631
00:46:53,856 --> 00:46:55,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, next email.

632
00:46:55,216 --> 00:46:55,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

633
00:46:55,616 --> 00:46:56,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, OLR.

634
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:59,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Just wanted to congratulate you on your 200th episode since I won't be listening live tonight.

635
00:47:00,018 --> 00:47:00,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one.

636
00:47:00,618 --> 00:47:01,919
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's from Mike.

637
00:47:02,379 --> 00:47:02,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

638
00:47:02,679 --> 00:47:04,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

639
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:05,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Next one up.

640
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:06,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, long one.

641
00:47:07,141 --> 00:47:07,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Not long, long, but.

642
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:13,832
[SPEAKER_06]: This is actually from Kenji, who I posted his email as my email of the month.

643
00:47:14,072 --> 00:47:15,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this is our essay writer.

644
00:47:15,553 --> 00:47:21,275
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to start doing an email of the month, by the way, so make sure you start sending in very thoughtful and well-written things that don't have hate in them.

645
00:47:23,195 --> 00:47:24,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy 200th episode, OLR.

646
00:47:25,016 --> 00:47:28,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations on making it this far, and here's hoping for your continued successes and good fortune.

647
00:47:29,177 --> 00:47:29,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheers.

648
00:47:29,958 --> 00:47:30,618
[SPEAKER_06]: This won't be long.

649
00:47:30,658 --> 00:47:35,039
[SPEAKER_06]: I figure that everything I'll mention in this letter will already be mentioned before you even touch this week's mailbag.

650
00:47:35,399 --> 00:47:36,800
[SPEAKER_06]: They blew it, blew it, blew it, blew it.

651
00:47:37,372 --> 00:47:39,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo couldn't have been set up any better.

652
00:47:39,995 --> 00:47:41,878
[SPEAKER_06]: $600 PS3 on November 17th.

653
00:47:42,298 --> 00:47:43,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Can Kutaragi stick up his ass?

654
00:47:44,241 --> 00:47:45,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Microsoft with a dollar sign.

655
00:47:46,544 --> 00:47:48,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Problem with selling 360s in every other market in the US.

656
00:47:48,987 --> 00:47:50,649
[SPEAKER_06]: The cars were all laid out in Nintendo's favor.

657
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:55,035
[SPEAKER_06]: All Reggie had to say was $199, October something or the other, and get off the stage.

658
00:47:55,315 --> 00:47:55,776
[SPEAKER_06]: But they didn't.

659
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:57,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

660
00:48:14,998 --> 00:48:18,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, does anyone else see the Pictochat-like qualities in the Wii channels?

661
00:48:18,842 --> 00:48:20,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell, it might just be the system alone.

662
00:48:20,943 --> 00:48:30,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Just as Pictochat sold DS systems in Japan without selling any accompanying software, Photo Channel and the Mii Channel especially seem to be those quirky things that'll keep non-gamers entertained for hours.

663
00:48:30,292 --> 00:48:36,817
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they have the Wii Forums, where you can post stuff with your caricature as your little avatar.

664
00:48:36,917 --> 00:48:38,599
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but that's specific to your Wii, right?

665
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:40,000
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not Internet Wii.

666
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:40,641
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.

667
00:48:40,701 --> 00:48:41,842
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was your own Wii.

668
00:48:42,406 --> 00:48:44,427
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like for family members to leave messages to each other.

669
00:48:44,728 --> 00:48:45,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Mom, you suck.

670
00:48:45,588 --> 00:48:46,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop playing.

671
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:48,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Dad's a whore.

672
00:48:49,891 --> 00:48:51,793
[SPEAKER_03]: For a good time, call Mom.

673
00:48:52,913 --> 00:48:54,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Last night, ooh!

674
00:48:55,895 --> 00:49:00,639
[SPEAKER_06]: And it said, Mad, just my opinions from a slightly educated gamer.

675
00:49:01,279 --> 00:49:08,084
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you haven't answered this already, will the higher, near next-gen price point keep you guys from getting a Wii?

676
00:49:08,304 --> 00:49:09,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks and congrats again, Kenji.

677
00:49:10,649 --> 00:49:19,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, didn't he say, I mean, I think this guy's great and all because he has a lot to say, but didn't he just say, you know, Nintendo fucked up, and then he said, but it sounds kind of neat.

678
00:49:20,632 --> 00:49:30,454
[SPEAKER_06]: I think what the intention was is that Nintendo could have gotten a whole lot more in the terms of new people buying the system had it just been dropped a little bit more, had a few more pack-ins.

679
00:49:30,614 --> 00:49:32,315
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not doom and gloom.

680
00:49:32,375 --> 00:49:33,335
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still the cheapest.

681
00:49:33,935 --> 00:49:34,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm...

682
00:49:34,702 --> 00:49:36,324
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still the cheapest one on the shelf.

683
00:49:36,344 --> 00:49:37,125
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Sunshine and Rainbows.

684
00:49:37,225 --> 00:49:40,610
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not only the cheapest one on the shelf, but it's the cheapest one on the shelf with the game.

685
00:49:41,211 --> 00:49:45,116
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can buy that in a 360 and still not pay as much as you would for... Wii 60.

686
00:49:45,436 --> 00:49:49,101
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pre-ordering one in both GameStop and my work, so I may have two.

687
00:49:56,434 --> 00:49:58,856
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not allowed to talk about how I'm getting a Wii, but I am getting a Wii.

688
00:49:59,156 --> 00:50:00,277
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will have it on release day.

689
00:50:01,678 --> 00:50:03,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we'll have ours on release day.

690
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:05,141
[SPEAKER_03]: We all will because we're special.

691
00:50:05,981 --> 00:50:08,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, the last email tonight comes from Alessa.

692
00:50:09,684 --> 00:50:10,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

693
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:12,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, like Silent Hill?

694
00:50:13,007 --> 00:50:14,428
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I'm excited about that.

695
00:50:14,508 --> 00:50:14,969
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm kidding.

696
00:50:15,029 --> 00:50:20,153
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually a link to an article about a father that killed his child over a video game.

697
00:50:22,001 --> 00:50:22,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no.

698
00:50:24,484 --> 00:50:26,165
[SPEAKER_06]: What's he playing World of Warcraft?

699
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:56,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Reading further in the article, apparently just being a cute little kid, she was pulling on the controller cord, playing with it, and the system fell, and he apparently was so upset he punched her in the face twice.

700
00:50:57,826 --> 00:51:02,708
[SPEAKER_06]: When the mother came in to ask, because she was taking a nap, she didn't know anything was happening.

701
00:51:03,389 --> 00:51:11,752
[SPEAKER_06]: When she got up to check on her daughter, she asked why she's not breathing, and he said she's breathing, she's just asleep or something like that, but

702
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:18,044
[SPEAKER_06]: She called the ambulance and she was pronounced dead at the scene.

703
00:51:19,144 --> 00:51:30,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently this guy was supposed to be, they said that he was a fairly non-violent person, but I think, first of all, I think the game has nothing to do with it.

704
00:51:31,188 --> 00:51:34,549
[SPEAKER_06]: What if he had been building a house of cards and she knocked it over?

705
00:51:36,866 --> 00:51:43,507
[SPEAKER_06]: If he's given to punch somebody over something, especially a child, over something so trivial, he would have done it over anything.

706
00:51:43,527 --> 00:51:45,607
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some type of violent gene there.

707
00:51:45,788 --> 00:51:48,808
[SPEAKER_06]: That definitely has nothing to do with a video game.

708
00:51:49,168 --> 00:51:51,769
[SPEAKER_06]: That is one seriously mentally fucked up person.

709
00:51:52,029 --> 00:51:56,109
[SPEAKER_00]: On a completely unrelated note, five bucks says it was Madden.

710
00:51:56,489 --> 00:51:58,130
[SPEAKER_00]: I kid, I kid, I kid.

711
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:04,511
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was Baby Tossing 2000, you know, on the Xbox 360 arcade, apparently.

712
00:52:04,531 --> 00:52:05,991
[SPEAKER_06]: It actually doesn't say what game it was from.

713
00:52:06,031 --> 00:52:06,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

714
00:52:07,042 --> 00:52:15,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendog Sniper 2006 The sad thing is that the lady was pregnant with another baby.

715
00:52:16,568 --> 00:52:18,810
[SPEAKER_03]: The good news is he'll be the hell away from that one.

716
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:20,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he is locked up.

717
00:52:20,751 --> 00:52:25,374
[SPEAKER_06]: They're actually charging him with murder, endangering the welfare of a child, and possession of an instrument of crime.

718
00:52:27,175 --> 00:52:32,678
[SPEAKER_06]: But the thing that struck me is that the lady was saying that her daughter is never going to meet her big sister.

719
00:52:32,698 --> 00:52:35,000
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was what got me on that.

720
00:52:35,788 --> 00:52:59,889
[SPEAKER_06]: GS68 in our chatroom says I'll say it now shut up Jack seriously you know he's gonna hop on that shit but again I don't think it was what he was doing so much you know if she had toppled over something else he might have been working on if he was that mentally unstable to strike a child you know then he would have done it over anything

721
00:53:03,363 --> 00:53:06,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm not sure how to transition to this story.

722
00:53:06,665 --> 00:53:11,528
[SPEAKER_03]: I suppose I could say something about at least he didn't throw the Guitar Hero controller.

723
00:53:11,668 --> 00:53:12,028
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

724
00:53:12,568 --> 00:53:14,129
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is a story on Guitar Hero 2.

725
00:53:14,949 --> 00:53:16,430
[SPEAKER_03]: New songs announced for the game.

726
00:53:17,011 --> 00:53:22,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Mega Death with Hanger 18 is supposedly going to be like the last final boss song in the game.

727
00:53:22,494 --> 00:53:23,174
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be pretty rad.

728
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:25,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Aerosmith with Last Child.

729
00:53:25,855 --> 00:53:28,517
[SPEAKER_03]: And this song I think is pretty cool coming to Guitar Hero 2.

730
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:30,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheap Trick with Surrender.

731
00:53:31,434 --> 00:53:32,654
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be kind of fun.

732
00:53:32,934 --> 00:53:33,394
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.

733
00:53:33,834 --> 00:53:36,255
[SPEAKER_06]: They've already announced the one song I was most interested in, though.

734
00:53:36,315 --> 00:53:37,115
[SPEAKER_03]: What, the Spinal Tap?

735
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:37,855
[SPEAKER_06]: No, YYZ.

736
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:38,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

737
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:40,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Aren't you a big fan of the Spinal Tap?

738
00:53:40,396 --> 00:53:41,056
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Rush.

739
00:53:41,256 --> 00:53:41,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

740
00:53:42,116 --> 00:53:42,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Rush is cool.

741
00:53:43,156 --> 00:53:47,717
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, I'm glad to see that Guitar Hero 2 seems to be on its way to being finished.

742
00:53:48,217 --> 00:53:53,618
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another game which supposedly is going to be finished pretty soon.

743
00:53:54,278 --> 00:53:58,179
[SPEAKER_01]: Duke Nukem Forever is apparently in the polished stage.

744
00:53:58,659 --> 00:54:00,059
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the fuck does that mean.

745
00:54:00,751 --> 00:54:01,892
[SPEAKER_01]: The polish stage.

746
00:54:02,052 --> 00:54:06,776
[SPEAKER_01]: It means that the physics and animation systems are virtually finished and shippable.

747
00:54:07,176 --> 00:54:09,798
[SPEAKER_01]: It's simply maintenance and polish from here on out.

748
00:54:09,979 --> 00:54:14,923
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't needed to make substantial changes to those systems in months.

749
00:54:15,303 --> 00:54:17,425
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they mean polish as in polishing a turd.

750
00:54:18,025 --> 00:54:20,647
[SPEAKER_03]: The changes have been made... Sorry the game's delayed.

751
00:54:20,707 --> 00:54:26,212
[SPEAKER_03]: We've all been too busy polishing our poles.

752
00:54:26,232 --> 00:54:28,093
[SPEAKER_01]: It says... And then he goes on to say...

753
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:30,750
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked for Prey Drew said it worked for Prey

754
00:54:55,024 --> 00:54:56,105
[SPEAKER_01]: Pray, I don't think so.

755
00:54:56,565 --> 00:54:58,285
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't that great of a game.

756
00:54:58,365 --> 00:54:59,006
[SPEAKER_01]: Pray's kind of fun.

757
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:04,168
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of fun, but kind of fun isn't like, wow, ten years in the making.

758
00:55:05,248 --> 00:55:09,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we'll see how the free expansion pack is that's supposedly coming.

759
00:55:11,191 --> 00:55:18,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know how we're always bringing up some of our more quirky games?

760
00:55:18,394 --> 00:55:21,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Majesco is bringing Cake Mania to the DS.

761
00:55:23,328 --> 00:55:24,068
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

762
00:55:46,317 --> 00:55:52,580
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll bring in the touchscreen part so you can bake your cakes with extra touch power, I guess.

763
00:55:53,941 --> 00:55:58,163
[SPEAKER_06]: But it will be the full game plus the Back to the Bakery expansion pack.

764
00:55:59,363 --> 00:56:03,786
[SPEAKER_06]: So if anyone's into the weirdo quirk stuff, it will be coming out for $20.

765
00:56:03,826 --> 00:56:08,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Developed by Digital Embryo, which I think is a cool name.

766
00:56:09,769 --> 00:56:12,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Another series that Majesco is going to be bringing out.

767
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:14,431
[SPEAKER_03]: They have two titles in development for the Wii series.

768
00:56:14,901 --> 00:56:15,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Bust-a-Move

769
00:56:43,444 --> 00:56:46,807
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wondering if it was maybe the Cake Mania thing came out later or something, but I guess not.

770
00:56:46,827 --> 00:56:48,529
[SPEAKER_03]: There's ones for the DS and ones for the Wii.

771
00:56:48,849 --> 00:56:51,231
[SPEAKER_03]: So we should have more information pretty soon.

772
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:56,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, that's going to bring to an end this Part B of our podcast.

773
00:56:57,356 --> 00:56:59,538
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you guys are thinking, wait a minute, you haven't taken calls yet.

774
00:56:59,598 --> 00:57:00,920
[SPEAKER_03]: You haven't done last minute stories yet.

775
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:06,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, tonight, guys, for our very special episode number 200, we're going to be doing a Part C.

776
00:57:07,247 --> 00:57:08,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Part C of Episode 200 hits our podcast feed
