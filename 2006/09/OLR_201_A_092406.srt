00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, September 24th, 2006, PlayStation 3 reaction from the Tokyo Game Show

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Cold Shooter Classic is about to get a sequel

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and the company that makes music game controllers sues someone over music game controllers

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Welcome once again to Orange Lounge Radio

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, and the gamer culture and lifestyle

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only, Dark Sakura, Miss Jamie Summers

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Roar

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
How you doing?

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Roar

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Roar?

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Roar

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Or Zip

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Or A-R-J if you're old school

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Roar

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Roar

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Also say hello to the one and only, Tech Master, Lowkey

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hi

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
How you doing?

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm frustrated

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Why?

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Because certain things aren't working the way they should be

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I see

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Don't you hate that?

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I do hate that

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
How things are described is very simple, yet never are

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Welcome to life, here's your manual

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Also say hello to joining us tonight

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Once again, we're going to have to ban you from the show pretty soon

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You're here too much, no I'm kidding

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Say hello to Drunami

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
7-Zip is the wave of the future dammit

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Whatever

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We're a little bit cooled off this week

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We had a pretty exciting week last week obviously with our 200th episode

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But we're back here for episode 201

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Doing the same stuff we're used to doing every week

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The show's back to be in just two parts, of course we release on the podcast stream every Monday

43
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And about Wednesday is just when you can expect to see part B

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Or if you want to hear the whole thing in bulk you can listen to us live when we record on orangelaundry.com

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
On Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Or you can listen to our rebroadcast live of parts A and B that plays on all games radio

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Over at allgames.com and that plays Monday nights at 5 o'clock Pacific

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Or I believe 9 AM on Tuesdays

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So if you're an early bird you can always catch that and you can hear all the show before it hits the podcast stream

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Anyway we're going to start off as we always do talking about our gaming week

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Or in DarkSakura's case perhaps her pinball week, I don't know

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yeah really actually all I played this week was Star Trek The Next Generation Pinball

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Which we finally have mostly working except for a couple of really crappy soldering jobs

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Whoever the previous owner was just like oh let's just put a bunch of goo here and solder it

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And let's use hot glue to put this ramp back together and all this crap

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Well Dan's been working on it, it's working just fine now

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And other than that I ain't played crap because I've been like ugh

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I've been sick all this past week

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Pinball's still a type of game, I mean it's still

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Pinball is what we had before Pong

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Pinball is the backbone of the gaming community

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Well them's big words there but I would agree

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Without pinball we would not have our arcades

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
In the gaming tree pinball is an essential branch

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Pinball is the root

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I know I've said it before on this show, pinball was something I went to the arcades to play before DDR

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Because I didn't play a whole lot in the arcades before that

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Maybe your occasional Street Fighter 2, you know back when that was huge

69
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
When I was in junior high school using E. Honda's 100 hand slap

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Look I was 100 hand slapping bitches long before Xbox Live

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I remember going back in the old days and playing Old Black Knight

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Before it had a digital display

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Playing the Time Machine one

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Before we had digital displays, Pinbot

75
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I was going to say Pinbot was the shit

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Was Pinbot, I'll ask you this then we'll move on

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Was Pinbot on the NES a great thing

78
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Or a horrible mistransformation of the pinball experience

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Believe it or not I didn't have it

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The first pinball game that I actually played on a home console

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Was this like Gator game on the old school Gameboy

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Oh god, Revenge of the Gator

83
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Revenge of the Gator and Devil's Crush

84
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
On TurboGrafx

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Did you ever play Pinball Quest?

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
No

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Sonic Spinball however was my game

88
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Sonic Spinball was pretty awesome

89
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Pinball Quest though is an interesting 8-bit title

90
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's one of those things like, it was a really good concept

91
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
But it was a little bit glitchy sometimes

92
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I do have to agree with Act of Death, Terminator 2, pinball ruled

93
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But we're actually trying to work on getting a Medivhial Madness

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
One thing I need to tell Jaded is that we have a Guns N' Roses now

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Oh yeah

99
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yeah so we're in the Guns N' Roses Pinball Owners Club

100
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
How many pinball tables do you have now? You've got to have at least six

101
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Seven

102
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Oh my gosh

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
We've got Last Action Hero

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Whodunnit

105
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Twilight Zone, I love Twilight Zone

106
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
We have Johnny Mnemonic which sucks but Dan likes it

107
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
We've got Judge Dredd which actually now belongs to a friend of ours

108
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Because we traded with him to get the Guns N' Roses

109
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So we have Guns N' Roses and we have Star Trek The Next Generation

110
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You're gonna open up an arcade in your garage pretty soon

111
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Actually Dan's busy rearranging our entire house

112
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Trying to get four pinball machines in and two maim cabinets

113
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And yet I still have not come over and played all these pinball machines

114
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I think I need two

115
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
He's building me a maim cabinet out of a Tekken 3 so I'm fairly happy

116
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That's pretty hot

117
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Alright well we'll move on

118
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Loki how was your gaming week? Did you play any pinball?

119
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
No I did not

120
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That's too bad

121
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Well what did you play?

122
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Well I played Saints Row and did a little bit more than that, that was pretty fun

123
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And a little bit of Bomberman just because I have it

124
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And Cookie Mama, I bought that for Nellie and she hated it

125
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And so I've been playing it

126
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm glad you tried to buy the wife a cooking game to teach her a thing or two

127
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You know what

128
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
We try but it doesn't work you know

129
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'll buy it off you if you don't like it

130
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
No it's alright

131
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So you must like it then

132
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I play it just because I have it because you know

133
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I've gotten rid of most of my other DS games

134
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Okay explain to us you know because there's probably a lot of people who've seen this game on the shelves

135
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You know it's Cookie Mama and it's gone, what the F is that?

136
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's basically a bunch of mini games that you play through

137
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Depending on how you complete them you get a score at the end

138
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And basically they have different mini games depending on what dish you're creating

139
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So for example rice you know you'll have the first mini game will be measure out of the rice

140
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And you have to measure it to a line and you have to do it with a time limit

141
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And then they have another one that's a Japanese import game right

142
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yeah

143
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Okay just

144
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So rice is the first stage

145
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Rice is the first stage

146
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And then you have to measure out the water

147
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's your joke here sorry

148
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And then you have you know the stage where you have to wash the rice

149
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And then you have the stage where you have to cook the rice

150
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
They're all just like basically rhythm and you know

151
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Just kind of like cutting and tapping and stuff like that

152
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,280
Now, see, wouldn't this game be more fun, though, if there was rapping in the background,

153
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,280
you know?

154
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,280
Possibly.

155
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,800
Now, wash the rice, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, like, or what was the, uh, I'm the cooking

156
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
chicken.

157
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,400
Well, here's, the problem, the problem with the game is the sensitivity is really, like,

158
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:37,080
off on a lot of the games, so, you know, you're really gonna get frustrated with stuff, you

159
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,480
know, and, I don't know.

160
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,280
And then there's also some levels, they don't really give you a good description of what

161
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,760
you're supposed to do, so it's kinda hard and you get frustrated real easy, which is

162
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,000
why Nellie stopped playing, because she couldn't figure out what the hell she was supposed

163
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,880
to do in certain levels, because it doesn't really explain it to you, they give you the

164
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,720
option to practice it, but they don't really kind of take you through a tutorial to tell

165
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,200
you how to cook, they're just like, do it!

166
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,960
Because Japanese are smarter, so, that's just, you know, that way that is.

167
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:11,840
Um, then of course, you know, Grand Theft Auto, because that's fun, um, Zuma, I've been

168
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,280
playing a lot of Xbox Live Arcade stuff.

169
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:21,440
I played Fusion Frenzy 2, which is part of that, you know, Tokyo Game Show demo thingy

170
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,880
on the live, and Fusion Frenzy 2 sucks balls, and I will not be buying that game.

171
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,880
Why?

172
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,880
It looked interesting to the trailer.

173
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,640
It was extremely lame.

174
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,640
Extremely lame.

175
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,640
What was lame about it?

176
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,580
Well, the games themselves are just dumb, like, there's one level, it's like, we're

177
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:41,220
trying to be Mario Party, but we're not even coming near Mario Party, it's just all these

178
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:46,480
mini games that have, there's like no point to them, and they're just dumb.

179
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,400
Well, is it maybe just because it's a demo, and maybe it's just not, all the other mini

180
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,720
games, you know, are just kind of variations of these mini games.

181
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,960
It's just like, you know, there's one of them that you're kind of these gladiator, you know,

182
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,960
American Gladiator type ball things, and you're rolling around, and you basically, okay, who

183
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,040
can cover the most space with their color?

184
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,920
And okay, that's kind of lame.

185
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,060
And then there is another one where you have to pick up boxes and put them in your corner,

186
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,120
and you can steal boxes from other players.

187
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,680
It screams Mario Kart, or not Mario Kart, Mario Party, but without any of the actual

188
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,360
board stuff, and it's just a very lame generic game.

189
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:28,880
So, and surprising enough, it's also by Hudson, which made the wonderful smash hit game, Bomberman

190
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,880
Act Zero.

191
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,880
So are we surprised?

192
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,160
Okay, but at the same time, they also made Mario Party.

193
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,160
Excellent.

194
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,160
And you know what, they've really sucked it up on the 360 so far, so whatever.

195
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,320
Did you ever play the first one?

196
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,320
No, I didn't.

197
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,600
Because there's an interesting comment in our chat room here, Mystic Gohan says, Fusion

198
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,000
Frenzy 2 sucked, but number one owned.

199
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,760
Well, maybe this is going to be better in a full game, but I'm not buying it, so whatever.

200
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,360
I also played the new Tenchu game, which was only available in Japan, and it's pretty cool.

201
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,720
You know, I wasn't really into Tenchu, but I like running around, jumping on buildings

202
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,960
and stuff, and throwing ninja stars into people's heads, so that's kind of cool.

203
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,960
No, that sounds fun.

204
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,960
Yeah, so that's fun.

205
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,120
The only problem about that game, because it wasn't Japanese, I had trouble figuring

206
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,960
out the controls, because it is kind of difficult to figure out what you've got to do.

207
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,960
So once I figured it out, it's pretty fun.

208
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,600
But supposedly they're putting up a Sonic the Hedgehog demo later, so that'd be pretty

209
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,600
cool to check out.

210
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,120
And I don't know if you want me to talk about it now, but I got this wonderful device, sure

211
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,120
go for it.

212
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,880
On the Xbox Live Vision camera, I have to say that this thing sucks.

213
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,880
Really?

214
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,880
Yeah.

215
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,280
Because I've heard a lot of positive reviews elsewhere.

216
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,480
Okay, the camera is blurry as fuck.

217
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,480
Blurry, blurry, blurry.

218
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,920
Did you just do something to it?

219
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,920
No.

220
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,920
Did you leave the sticker on?

221
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,160
No, there is no sticker on this thing.

222
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,200
I don't think there is a sticker on this thing.

223
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,320
No, there is no sticker on this thing.

224
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,680
It would have been hella funny if there was, and he's like, son of a bitch!

225
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,680
No.

226
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,160
Okay, so it's very blurry.

227
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,440
Very, very blurry.

228
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,960
That's because it knew what you and Nelly were going to be doing with it, so it had

229
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,160
to blur out the naughty bits.

230
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:08,640
Okay, I just wanted to take a picture of my face to put it on the Xbox Live, and no matter

231
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,640
what kind of lighting I have in the room, it's always blurry.

232
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,400
Very, very blurry.

233
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,800
And no matter what I do to adjust the focus on it, always blurry.

234
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,920
And then the other thing on this as well, I'm trying to hook it up to my PC.

235
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,280
Apparently it's supposed to be as easy as, plug in PC work.

236
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,280
No.

237
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,640
Of course it's never going to be like that.

238
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:32,280
So I got the updated drivers for it, and it's funny because the old drivers work kinda crappy,

239
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,280
but they work.

240
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,960
The new drivers don't work at all.

241
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,360
So this thing is just, it's doing nothing.

242
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,480
I was going to have a webcam for you guys, folks, and we were going to have the wonderful

243
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,720
webcam, but you can thank Microsoft for putting out a really shoddy camera.

244
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,400
What would happen if I plugged that in my Mac?

245
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,800
You think it would work right away?

246
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,200
No, it'll just go.

247
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,960
I'm going to try it during the break.

248
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,960
You know I gotta try.

249
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,520
Well, here's the thing.

250
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,520
Just for you.

251
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,520
That's the thing, though.

252
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,720
Like I said, the generic drivers worked on it.

253
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,440
The new drivers do not.

254
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,240
So go right ahead and try that, but you know what?

255
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,240
The new drivers don't.

256
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,240
So, whatever.

257
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:17,120
Now, the cool thing, you tried to video chat with me, and it was pretty blurry, but what's

258
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,160
interesting is that another podcaster, our old buddy Bobby, sent a picture of his kitty

259
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,440
cat, because you can send pictures on Xbox Live instead of messages if you want, and

260
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,520
I got a picture of his kitty cat, and it was pretty clear.

261
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,240
It was a little dark, like there were some contrast issues, but he probably just didn't

262
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,360
have the right lighting behind it.

263
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,040
Most of our houses aren't set up to have lighting behind where our systems are at.

264
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,600
At least in this house, I know the lighting is by the couch.

265
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,920
That's probably why he has the contrast issues, but it was sharp, unlike when we video chatted.

266
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,920
Well, here's the thing.

267
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,880
The video chat's only in 640 by 480, whereas the pictures are 1.3 megapixels, so that's

268
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,880
the difference.

269
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:59,040
So, yeah, it looks all blurry, but then when you take a picture, it's just, you know, supposed

270
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,040
to be clear.

271
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,520
Except for your gamer tag pictures, those are still blurry as hell, because I took one

272
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,280
and I'm like, wow, I can't see anything in it.

273
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,680
Then how come some of the other, like I have three other podcasters on my list who got

274
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,880
the camera early, because Microsoft likes them, and they all look fine.

275
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,520
I don't get it, but here's the thing, I say take it back.

276
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,520
It's not my face.

277
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,520
I'm not blurry.

278
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:28,120
I think that's what SSJ100Matt in chat says, maybe it's your face, Loki.

279
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,280
Yeah, and here's the other thing.

280
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,880
Thank you, Microsoft.

281
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:41,080
This camera is made for cyber sex, and I showed Rob why this camera is made for cyber sex.

282
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,240
It's very disturbing.

283
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,240
For some reason...

284
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,720
And I never want to see it again.

285
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:52,880
Okay, for some reason, a feature that was added into the video chat on live, and explain

286
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,800
to me why you would need this.

287
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:01,680
If you push the trigger buttons on your controller, it makes the other person's controller vibrate,

288
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,040
as long as you hold them down.

289
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:10,360
If that does not screen cyber sex, I don't know what does.

290
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,360
Thank you, Microsoft.

291
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,600
You guys really thought of everything.

292
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,760
You vision camera, would I recommend buying it?

293
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,760
I don't know.

294
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:27,080
I mean, maybe the room I'm using, because I got the camera to look decent, it was just

295
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:32,800
very blurry still, but compared to the last digital camera that we had, the webcam, I

296
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,800
guess it's okay.

297
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,240
I can't just get this thing to work anymore.

298
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,200
We'll try it on my Xbox when we're done, see if maybe the different lighting in this house

299
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,200
will help.

300
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,200
Maybe.

301
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,200
I don't know.

302
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,160
It's worth picking up if you can find one.

303
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,800
I know GameStop, at least where I got mine pre-ordered at, they didn't get any extras

304
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,920
in, so it might be pretty hard to find.

305
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,480
I'm not getting one.

306
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,600
You know what, you're not interested in the vision thing?

307
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,600
No.

308
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,800
You don't want the whole vibration with the controller thing?

309
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,800
No.

310
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,480
It was kind of funny when he did it, because it was like, what the hell, why is the controller

311
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,480
shaking?

312
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,480
And Loogie's like, do you feel that?

313
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,480
Do you feel that?

314
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:16,000
I have a PC, and I actually have a real webcam, which nobody is giving the address to since

315
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,320
I don't upload it to anywhere.

316
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:22,480
But you can't play Uno with the webcam on the PC, at least I don't know any versions

317
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,480
of it yet.

318
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,400
I don't touch our Xbox 360.

319
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,400
What about Dead Rising?

320
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,640
Okay, I played that, but that was the last thing I played, because it was all about zombie

321
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,640
killing.

322
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,640
I've been sort of not playing the 360.

323
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,520
No interest in Totem Ball or anything?

324
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,520
Pinball.

325
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,520
I don't know.

326
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,040
I kind of want one, but it can also kind of wait.

327
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,200
I mean, it's not something, I think I support many games for it right now, so yeah, I thought

328
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,880
I would want it right away, and I was kind of looking for one, but now I'm like, eh,

329
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,280
do I really need to video chat?

330
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,400
I don't know.

331
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,320
It can wait, especially after seeing Loogie's.

332
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,320
We'll see.

333
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,800
Let's see, My Gaming Week.

334
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,620
Actually not a lot of new stuff.

335
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,560
There really wasn't anything new I picked up this week.

336
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:08,200
I was interested in getting the camera at one point, but I wasn't able to get it, because

337
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,640
I didn't pre-order one, because I didn't think I would want it, but then I was going to go

338
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,460
look for it, and they didn't have it.

339
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:17,520
So I've pretty much just been watching a friend of mine play through Enchanted Arms, because

340
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,200
I showed it to a friend of mine, and he's been in love with it, and just over here playing

341
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:27,480
it a lot, so he got further and I did, so I think he's about, I think the percentage

342
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,560
said he was like 46% of the way through the game, so some of the voice acting gets a little

343
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,120
better when you get to midway.

344
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,160
Some of the voice actors are pretty good, and some are still pretty bad, but the game's

345
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,880
plot got interesting.

346
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,140
It's pretty fun.

347
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:43,720
I think if you're a role-playing fan and you happen to have a 360, you should definitely

348
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,720
check out Enchanted Arms, because there's really not a lot else for you right now on

349
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,380
the 360, and Enchanted Arms is decent.

350
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,800
It's not a, hey, we made this at the last minute so we could say we have an RPG on the

351
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,800
system.

352
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
It's pretty good.

353
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,800
I was pretty happy.

354
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,920
Drew Nami, how was your gaming week?

355
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,600
Oddly enough, I've been playing a lot of Rez.

356
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,600
Really?

357
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,400
Really, really.

358
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,240
Aside from that, I haven't been really playing that many games.

359
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,320
They took a break from WoW and, oh yeah, I've been playing World of Warcraft a lot, actually.

360
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:19,400
I'm in a new guild, so my friend convinced me to join the gay guild on Proudmoore, so

361
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,680
I've been playing there a lot.

362
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,680
It's fun.

363
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,680
Yeah, I took a break.

364
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,320
I'm a little bit burned out.

365
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:29,240
Aside from that, I've been playing a little bit of Xenosaga, episode one, trying to finish

366
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,160
it so I can move on.

367
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,240
I borrowed Dirge of Cerberus from a friend.

368
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:38,440
It's actually not too bad, even though console first-person shooters are kind of just a sacrilege

369
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,160
to me.

370
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:46,440
Aside from that, I'm trying to get through Kingdom Hearts II on Proudmoore, and I realized

371
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,840
how much I truly suck at that game.

372
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,420
Aside from that, not much.

373
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,160
What would you say to the people that say Kingdom Hearts II is nothing but a bunch of

374
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,580
button mashing?

375
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,480
You haven't played it on Proudmoore, and you haven't gotten to Beast's Castle round two.

376
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,680
As you said, I read some reviews that said- There's even regular mode, the Demyx battle.

377
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,040
Yeah, Demyx is just a pain in the ass.

378
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,040
He's just a bitch.

379
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,400
Alright, well, let's go on to some housekeeping, and then we're going to-

380
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,920
Oh, I wanted to mention one thing that I thought was pretty cool.

381
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,160
GameStop, when I went and picked up my camera, I just looked around a little bit to see if

382
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,600
there's anything else I wanted.

383
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:27,440
I found a BeatMania 2DX turntable controller for $8.

384
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,440
Picked that sucker up.

385
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,080
Now, it's mine, because at least I'm babysitting it for a little while, because Loki hates

386
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,080
BeatMania.

387
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,720
Well, I just don't have any games.

388
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,160
At the time, I didn't have my PlayStation 2 back, but I finally got it back.

389
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,160
Do you have US BeatMania?

390
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,160
No.

391
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,160
You can borrow that?

392
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,680
If you want, you can borrow my- So, you can borrow my Japanese PlayStation, and the various

393
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,680
styles I own.

394
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,680
I don't own them all.

395
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,680
No, I've got my HD loader.

396
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,680
I'll just load the Japanese.

397
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,680
Oh, well.

398
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,840
I'll put the new 2DX that they have in Japan over there on it.

399
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,840
Alright, well.

400
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,240
Excuse me for trying to do something- I'll just leave the controller here, because

401
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,440
I don't want to play 2DX.

402
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,440
I couldn't pass that up.

403
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,440
I'm going to play doubles.

404
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,680
I'm going to get back into 2DX and play doubles, because doubles keyboard mania was a blast,

405
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,680
and when you could play that in the arcade, people were like, WTF!

406
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,240
So many buttons!

407
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:16,800
Dude, no, watching someone do, like, a seven-star- Yeah, I was never as good- I mean, I could

408
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,080
get through a couple doubles songs, you know.

409
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,680
I was pretty decent- I could do three stars, that was it, and doubles.

410
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,400
Who was that guy that is so good at keyboard mania?

411
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,400
Blue?

412
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,400
Is that his name?

413
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,400
Blue Guy?

414
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,400
Whoa!

415
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,240
He can smoke those doubles, like, you know, that are, like, the maximum level, and I'll

416
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,280
tell you what- I loved watching him play keyboard mania, though.

417
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:42,120
That gives me a gamer boner so much more than the 2DX and Papa Music videos.

418
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,440
He also plays piano very well.

419
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,560
Yeah, because I like the piano music a lot more.

420
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,600
I mean, I'm not disrespecting the 2DX, you know, because there's a lot of impressive

421
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,320
stuff there, but watching the keyboard mania was, whew, very impressive.

422
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,520
You should also see him do doubles on Pump It Up.

423
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,520
Alright.

424
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,520
Someday, someday.

425
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,520
Alright.

426
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,520
Housekeeping!

427
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,520
First, we want to thank everybody for all the well wishes for episode 200, because we

428
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,560
continued to kind of get them throughout the week, even after the show.

429
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,280
I got a couple messages on Xbox Live, which was very nice, and I know we got some emails

430
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,880
and some message board posts, so we just wanted to say thank you guys, and it was a fun show,

431
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,720
it was a long show, but it was a fun show, and really glad you guys that were able to

432
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,960
join us live did, or if you couldn't join us live, we're glad you got through all three

433
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,760
parts, so thank you.

434
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,280
Also want to say the DDR sneak peeks are continuing tonight.

435
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,280
Those haven't stopped.

436
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,440
They'll be a little later on in this program, four new tracks, two from Ultramix 4 and two

437
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:40,160
from Universe, and also I want to say about this podcast is we are now a default podcast

438
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:45,900
on a little handy program called XB Stream, and if you haven't checked out this program,

439
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,120
it's pretty neat.

440
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,080
I'm so surprised that something like this came out of Homebrew.

441
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,320
I'm saying that in a positive way.

442
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,300
It pretty much seems like one person really put in all this effort into this program and

443
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:03,100
just really did something that Microsoft should have done themselves.

444
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,080
It's kind of impressive that this one guy did this, but basically what he's done is

445
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,040
he set up a program that not only catches podcasts and automatically shares them over

446
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:16,380
the network to your Xbox 360, it doesn't put them on the hard drive if the Xbox 360 uses

447
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:20,780
the network, but what it also does is it downloads RSS feeds.

448
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,840
Let's say you want to read Kotaku.

449
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:27,840
Let's say you have Kotaku in your feed, and what it does is it translates the text of

450
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,400
the RSS feed and makes it an image, and then so if you go through your photo gallery on

451
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,500
Xbox 360, you can read RSS feeds, and you might be thinking, well, when in the hell

452
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,500
would this be useful?

453
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,320
Well, if somebody else is using the computer and you're using the Xbox 360, you could still

454
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:46,440
read those live blogging things going on, so it's a really neat idea, so I think that's

455
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:51,080
great and we're really happy to be included as one of the podcasts that you'll get when

456
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,420
you download this program now, so if you want to check it out, it's over at xbstream.com.

457
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:59,640
This is the same program that caused a little bit of controversy when it first came out

458
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:05,960
because I imagine the program was originally designed with RSS feeds in mind, so what it

459
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,800
was doing is that it was refreshing the RSS feeds every 15 minutes and grabbing the last

460
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
30 items.

461
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:16,400
Well, the unfortunate thing is is that when they decided to enable the podcast stuff as

462
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,960
well, they kept the same settings, so folks that were in the initial release of the program

463
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,580
as the default podcast, like I know GamerAndy was one of them, among many others, like his

464
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:30,280
site got hammered because you had all these people that were trying out the software because

465
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:36,200
Major Nelson had posted about it, downloading 30 episodes of his show at a time and re-hammering

466
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,200
his feed.

467
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,080
It was almost like getting a denial of service attack, so it was like one of those, oh, crap,

468
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,560
someone made a really big mistake, but I know they all worked it out and the author of the

469
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,120
program was very like, oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, and they've worked

470
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:53,120
it out now, so it only, I think, hits it once in a while and it only downloads one podcast

471
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:59,440
by default, so that's pretty exciting because when I told the webmaster, our old friend

472
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,040
VxJ6V that we were going to be on there, he's like, wait a minute, I was reading that this

473
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,040
might not be a good thing.

474
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,800
I'm like, no, no, no, they fixed it, they fixed it, we're cool, so anyway, check it

475
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:12,780
out if you guys have an Xbox 360 and a network that it's connected to.

476
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,080
Now we shall go into some news.

477
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,080
Shall we, Jamie?

478
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,080
Sure, why don't we?

479
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,440
Well, you know, I always shake my head because, you know what I call him?

480
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,400
I call him Ken Crayon Eater.

481
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:34,360
So apparently the price of the PlayStation 3 in Japan has been dropped.

482
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:40,460
Even though they're still having the delays with their production, they're stating that

483
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:48,720
they are going to reprice the 20 gigabyte model with an inclusion of the HDMI port for

484
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:59,400
49,980 yen, which is roughly 48 bucks in the US, about 225 pounds in the UK, which is actually

485
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,280
a reduction from 62,790 yen.

486
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:08,240
So that's a pretty significant drop, at least, you know, a couple hundred.

487
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:15,080
So they're also saying that at the Tokyo Game Show there were going to be 200 playable consoles.

488
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:19,200
What I haven't found out is if they are actually still those rack mounted servers.

489
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,600
Yes, they are.

490
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,120
See, I'm not surprised.

491
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,560
Now one thing that was mentioned, and I found out, you know, after reading the article a

492
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:31,080
bit of a rebuttal on this, is that they're saying that the online service was going to

493
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,480
offer Mega Drive and PC Engine titles, but Sega had something different to say about

494
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,880
that, didn't they?

495
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,880
Yes.

496
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,720
They said that it was something that they were considering based on, you know, the architecture

497
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:47,480
of the online system, but it wasn't something that they were doing right away.

498
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,960
More proof that Ken Kudaragi eats crayons.

499
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,120
However, one thing I do think is kind of cool is their global mapping system so that you

500
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:59,320
can, basically what it does is you upload your pictures, data about where you live,

501
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,800
and it makes a world map where various PS3 gamers live.

502
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,840
It's kind of neat, but...

503
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,640
So it's like that one site.

504
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,640
What is that site?

505
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,640
Frapper.

506
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,640
Thank you.

507
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,640
Frapper.

508
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,480
It's like a frapper, because we have an Orange Launch Radio Frapper, and you should join

509
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,540
that if you haven't already, but yeah, it sounds like Frapper for your PS3.

510
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,040
I'm getting that impression.

511
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,040
Huh.

512
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,840
But I still think that, you know, he needs to keep the bicycle helmet on a little bit

513
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,840
longer.

514
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,320
His head hasn't quite healed from that last falling.

515
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,440
He's still got the baby soft spot.

516
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,440
Yeah.

517
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,720
His skull hasn't completely molded together.

518
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,680
You guys are crazy.

519
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:40,520
It's interesting because I'm reading about the XB Stream stuff in chat, because apparently,

520
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,740
you know, some of the other podcasters who were affected by that whole thing were very

521
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,520
vocal about it, and some of our, you know, folks listen to other podcasts.

522
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,660
I do try to listen to other podcasts, but ever since my iPod broke last week, it's been

523
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:54,440
very hard for me to listen to other podcasts, so I'm kind of behind on all the gossip on

524
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,360
XB Stream.

525
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:01,560
But they're saying, let's see, they said here something about gamer Andy loves XB Stream.

526
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,480
I think there's a hint of sarcasm there.

527
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,200
Funny Dale says, XB Stream nearly shut down IGN.

528
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,200
I'm not kidding.

529
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,480
And then Funny Dale goes on to say, wait, shut down IGN.

530
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,460
On second thought, I love XB Stream.

531
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:18,560
But Black Wolf says, reminds us that Tiger Claw, or was saying to Tiger Claw, I guess

532
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:22,080
in a message here, he offered to compensate for the bandwidth bills.

533
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,320
The author was like, so, you know, oops, I really made a big, big mistake.

534
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,320
I'll pay for the bills.

535
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,600
I thought that was kind of nice, you know, so.

536
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:36,560
Anyway, moving on, I wanted to say really quickly regarding the PlayStation 3.

537
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,120
There's an interesting series that Kotaku's been running, because they have some folks

538
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:44,320
over at the show, and they've been posting these videos on YouTubes asking people, do

539
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,600
you want to get the Wii or the PlayStation 3?

540
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,240
Not sure why they didn't include the Xbox 360, but whatever.

541
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,460
I guess maybe they figured that, you know, Xbox 360 is not really the console of choice

542
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,460
in Japan right now.

543
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,460
Although, I don't know.

544
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:00,800
I figured they had long waits to see Blue Dragon, but anyway.

545
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:05,120
They're going Wii or PlayStation 3, and they did this little poll here, and it turns out

546
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,600
PlayStation 3 was getting about two to one of the vote.

547
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,680
So for every one person that said they wanted a Wii had two people that said they wanted

548
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,280
a PlayStation 3.

549
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:19,580
Now if you poll your average American, or heck, even European message board, I'm not

550
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,880
seeing that same correlation.

551
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:26,620
So what is it about Japan and their love for the PlayStation 3?

552
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:29,360
Is it the fact that Nintendo doesn't go to Tokyo Game Show?

553
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,360
I'll state the obvious there.

554
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:35,580
Is it maybe that people are just, you know, they're, because the ooh and aahs of Sony

555
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,880
being there, they're just loving that, and that's kind of skewing their view a little

556
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,880
bit, or what?

557
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:45,800
I think my old theory stands is that it has to do with getting a Blu-ray.

558
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,440
I mean, honestly, I think that the Japanese market is looking at the whole Blu-ray thing

559
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,440
as a positive.

560
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:55,260
I mean, having a DVD player in it is what sold the PS2, because at the time, it was

561
00:27:55,260 --> 00:28:00,820
a lot cheaper to get a PS2 than to go out and just buy a DVD player.

562
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,640
I think that they're looking for that multiple functionality.

563
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,640
Interesting.

564
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,300
I'm looking at our chat room to see what they say here.

565
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:13,840
Some folks, Fireboma says, Tokyo Game Show is mostly fanboys.

566
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,800
Nintendo wasn't at Tokyo Game Show, so their fans weren't there.

567
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:22,080
And some interesting, Nintendo Maniac 64 says, oh, the poll was probably done that way probably

568
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,400
because the 360 is already out.

569
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,020
So okay, that makes sense why they didn't include 360 in the poll.

570
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:32,240
But what about some of those, well, I don't know if, I can't remember if we get into it

571
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,640
later in the program, but I'll just quickly say, what about some of those 360 games that

572
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,880
are being shown at Tokyo Game Show?

573
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,680
I mean, do you think that this might sway the Japanese public at all?

574
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:46,120
I mean, I was watching the demo for Blue Dragon, some of the gameplay video, it looked pretty

575
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,120
hot.

576
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,080
So I don't know, is it going to be enough, or is it too little too late?

577
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,080
I guess we'll see.

578
00:28:53,080 --> 00:29:01,080
Well, as far as the PS3 itself, you know, where they were going to have the price drop

579
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:06,280
in Japan, we are not quite so lucky here.

580
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:12,680
There's basically stating that there is no plans to drop the price in the United States.

581
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:18,360
It's still going to be 499 for the low end, 599 for the 60 gig version.

582
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:25,400
There hasn't been any set word if that's going to apply to Europe as well, and they're still

583
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:29,760
set for 2007 launch in March.

584
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,760
Pretty interesting.

585
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,660
A lot of them might have to do with how it works here.

586
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:37,600
Do you think if we have a crappy launch here in the US that Europe might get the price

587
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,760
drop as incentive for them to go buy them?

588
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,320
It's possible, but that's not really how Sony plays.

589
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,640
One other thing though is that we are getting the HDMI slot on the low end system.

590
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:54,160
Well, that's interesting because a lot of people were saying that your PlayStation 3

591
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:59,400
would be totally gimped with no HDMI slot if in the future you choose to upgrade to

592
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,040
an HDTV.

593
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,000
So does this sway anyone's mind?

594
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,040
I don't know.

595
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:09,240
It's all about digitally signing those wonderful Blu-ray movies and possibly games.

596
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,560
That is why they need that HDMI slot on there because, you know, if you don't have that

597
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,620
then someone might be able to purchase the lower end model and, guess what, get past

598
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,080
all that encryption.

599
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,080
So that would be pretty nice.

600
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:23,240
Well, I guess we go back to that old saying, the game system is only as good as the games

601
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:28,200
that are on it, and I guess that will truly be what ends up selling these PlayStation

602
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,200
3s or not.

603
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,240
Yeah, and one of the games that they're hoping to sell the PlayStation 3s or at least

604
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,040
this online service is this game, Flow.

605
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:40,140
Now a lot of people may not know about Flow, or maybe you do because it's actually a

606
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:43,400
game that's already on the web for free.

607
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,360
Kind of funny because they're trying to sell the game.

608
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:50,100
Not saying it's a bad game, it's actually a pretty fun game, and you can check it out

609
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,100
online.

610
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,100
Just do a search for Flow.

611
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,760
It's a pretty cool little thing they were talking about.

612
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,440
It was actually kind of an experiment.

613
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,200
You know, if I do a search for Flow I might get a lot of websites that aren't related

614
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,120
to gaming at all.

615
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,480
So perhaps you might want to specify that search a little more.

616
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,480
Okay.

617
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:14,000
Well, if you want to play Flow in the wonderful Flash version, you can do so.

618
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,700
There's a couple different places to check it out.

619
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:33,200
The first one's going to be at intihuatanai.usc.edu slash cloud slash flowing slash core dot html.

620
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,320
So I hope you got a pen and paper for that one because...

621
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,840
If not, rewind the show and write faster.

622
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:42,960
Although, if you're looking for an easier way to actually play this, you can download

623
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:49,200
copies and I believe that there's one that's mirrored on PSP updates, or PS3 updates I

624
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,200
would imagine.

625
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:57,720
But anyways, so yeah, this game is going to be downloadable and supposedly you're going

626
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:02,160
to have to purchase this, which is kind of funny because isn't this going to have a browser

627
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,840
in it anyway, so couldn't you, I don't know, go browse over to this website and play it

628
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,840
for free?

629
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:13,720
I mean, that seems kind of retarded to me, that you would be able to, I don't know, download

630
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,480
this for free instead of paying for Sony's service.

631
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,880
That kind of defeats the purpose of...

632
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,560
Well, what about all those Geometry Wars clones when they were out there?

633
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:26,000
You know, you could play it for free, quote unquote, online or on the other platforms

634
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
they were putting it on.

635
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,440
Yeah, but you can't play it for free on the PlayStation 3.

636
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,440
See, you can actually go with...

637
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,520
Well, but you can't play Geometry Wars for free on the Xbox 360, that's what I'm saying.

638
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:43,000
But you can, with the PlayStation 3, web browse over to this site and either download it to

639
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,040
your hard drive and run it in Linux or you could, I don't know, play it in the web browser

640
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:52,480
assuming that this thing supports Flash, I would hope so since it's a next gen console

641
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,280
with the fucking cell processor, it should be able to support Flash.

642
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,280
So yeah, you could play this game.

643
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:07,160
Ota G says, but it's in HD, but who cares?

644
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:11,720
It's going to be in HD anyways because it's going to be on your TV.

645
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,720
I don't know.

646
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,720
I just think it's a waste of money.

647
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:18,220
All right, well this was certainly a controversial story in the scene this week regarding the

648
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:22,880
PlayStation 3 and it has to do with Gran Turismo HD.

649
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,040
And now there's these stories that have been going around about the fact that there's going

650
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:31,080
to be this Gran Turismo HD classic that's going to be kind of the entry into the GT

651
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:36,440
series and then there's going to be, I guess, 750 cars that you can download online for

652
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:41,520
between 50 cents to a dollar a piece and 50 tracks between a dollar fifty and four fifty

653
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,520
a piece.

654
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:47,160
They're all the cars that have been basically created for the Gran Turismo series for the

655
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,160
last 10 years.

656
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:52,040
But Gran Turismo HD Premium will come with two courses and 30 cars.

657
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:59,840
Yes, the Premium is going to be basically kind of a test model for Gran Turismo 5.

658
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,360
It's basically really detailed looking cars.

659
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:08,000
Think like Forza or something like that and it's just really nice stuff.

660
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,600
The reason why they don't have 750 cars in the Premium version is because they haven't

661
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,600
had a chance to create the models for all the cars yet.

662
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:24,720
They're really hurrying to get this game pushed out, which screams flaws up the ass.

663
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:29,880
Basically the classic version, I guess, is going to be an upscaled version of Gran Turismo

664
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,960
4 with all those wonderful cars to purchase.

665
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,880
So you're saying if I go to the store and buy this Gran Turismo classic, I can't do

666
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,880
anything with it?

667
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,920
Well, Classic and Premium are in one game.

668
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,920
It's different modes.

669
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,920
Oh, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

670
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,960
Oh, I made it sound like it was two separate games.

671
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,000
No, it's just one game.

672
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,600
You will get some cars, but if you think about it, 30 cars in two tracks is a lot less than

673
00:34:52,600 --> 00:35:00,000
say 250 that I'm used to getting at the store for $49.99 for PlayStation 2.

674
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,360
Huh, interesting.

675
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,320
I don't know, what do you think about this microtransaction thing?

676
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,600
Well, here's the thing.

677
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,580
It doesn't stop at cars or tracks.

678
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:13,520
They're going to be adding parts and skins for your cars as well.

679
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,440
They want it to become the iTunes of Gran Turismo, so you're going to be spending thousands

680
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,240
of dollars, hopefully, on this crap for one game.

681
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:27,800
Well, I think about Test Drive Unlimited, which is something I've been playing a lot

682
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,880
recently that also has a crap load of cars and a crap load of parts and things that you

683
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,160
can get with it, but you unlock them naturally as you go to the in-game store.

684
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,720
And none of this microtransaction crap, you know, you buy the game and all this stuff

685
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,720
is included.

686
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,460
You unlock it within the game, and that's what we're all kind of used to.

687
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,520
And here's the other fun thing about this, too.

688
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:54,060
They were saying that a lot of the cars in this, they're going to be expensive because

689
00:35:54,060 --> 00:36:02,920
they want you to actually be, you know, just kind of having that, I guess, other people

690
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,920
have expensive cars.

691
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,080
Ooh, I've got to have that expensive car.

692
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,200
It's not going to be, it's actually going to be expensive.

693
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,800
Do I get to buy horse armor for said car?

694
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,720
Well, if it were a horse, maybe, no.

695
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,880
But the whole thing screams to me as a bad idea.

696
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,400
And I think a lot of people, I mean, they may be fans of Gran Turismo, but who's really

697
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,360
going to pay for all the cars?

698
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:29,320
I mean, that's just like saying, oh, here's Madden NFL.

699
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,160
By the way, there's no teams or arenas included.

700
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,960
You have to purchase those separately.

701
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,440
Oh, by the way, the football's not included either, you know.

702
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:45,640
It's like buying a car without tires or an engine or seats or a body, I mean, it's retarded.

703
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,400
So what exactly am I paying for here?

704
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,560
TigerKlon's chat says, maybe you end up buying rims and spinners for the cars.

705
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,960
And that's the other thing, too, about these cars.

706
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,680
Haz says, I want to buy a pine air freshener for my car, a little fuzzy dice that can hang

707
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,000
from them.

708
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I mean, why would you spend all this money on this?

709
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,520
I really don't see people doing this, because I know they're really trying to push this

710
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:18,880
microtransaction thing, and if it goes well, you can better believe that Gran Turismo 5

711
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,200
is going to be the same thing.

712
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:26,520
Is there a possibility here that this whole thing's being grossly misinterpreted or something's

713
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,520
wrong here?

714
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,600
Because I know on the internet this week it was a little bit back and forth, rumor or

715
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,600
not rumor.

716
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:39,680
I had several interviews actually with the head people for the lead on Gran Turismo HD,

717
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,240
and they've confirmed this stuff.

718
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:45,480
Now the thing they haven't confirmed, at least they didn't say anything about the pricing

719
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:51,280
on this and whether a lot of people aren't probably going to be buying 750 cars.

720
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,000
That's a fact.

721
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,180
But they didn't mention, well, if I purchase, say, a Honda Civic or something and someone

722
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:04,200
purchases a Lamborghini, I mean, am I going to purchase a more expensive car to be able

723
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:11,240
to race against these people, because they're going to be smoking me in this soup of cars.

724
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:15,400
I think the whole thing's a bad idea, and I know there's been a lot of comparisons to

725
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:20,760
Project Gotham Racing 3, but I kind of find it a little bit, you know, that game does

726
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,560
actually come with cars and tracks.

727
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:27,020
In fact, I think quite an unlimited amount of tracks since you can create your own courses

728
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:31,960
in there, but the fact is I don't have to purchase these cars in order to be able to

729
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,340
enjoy the game, whereas if I want to play the online version of Classic, yes, you do

730
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:39,920
have to purchase those cars, and yes, you do have to purchase those tracks.

731
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,760
So I think it's kind of retarded that I should have to spend money on a game that I already

732
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,320
spent money on.

733
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,400
Interesting.

734
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,640
More interesting comments from chat.

735
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,640
They're just lit up on this.

736
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,800
Funny Dale says, Sony is going to make players of Gran Turismo HD pay $5 a gallon for virtual

737
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,800
gasoline.

738
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,320
PlayStation 3, this is really living.

739
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,240
Funny.

740
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,720
Stick Axe, you know, a little bit of a counterpoint here.

741
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:08,360
If the game was cheap, and if I only like a few tracks, I don't have to spend $40 for

742
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,840
a game I only want half of.

743
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:17,000
True, and the whole thing is, you know, the Gran Turismo HD Premium or whatever, it's

744
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,840
just a fucking demo for Gran Turismo 5 is basically what it is.

745
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,960
You know, why should I pay for an upscaled version of 4?

746
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:31,880
Seeing as you can buy 4 and upscale it anyways, you know, why the hell, well first off, if

747
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,400
I were ever to buy PlayStation 3, I would never be buying this game at all.

748
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,160
I mean, I would not touch this game with a 10 foot pole.

749
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,320
I would wait for a better racing game to come out, because you know what, there's going

750
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,480
to be a lot more out there.

751
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:47,640
The only way I could ever see this selling is if it were like $10 for the core of it,

752
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,920
and then everything else you can pay for.

753
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,480
If it were like, you know, you can buy 200 cars for $20 or something like that, then

754
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,920
maybe yeah, someone might go ahead and do that, but if I'm paying a buck a car, and

755
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:04,800
they want me to spend $900 on fucking cars, alright, that's going to happen.

756
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:11,220
I think that they did it very well for, what was it, Project Gotham 3 on Xbox 360 where

757
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,520
they had car packets.

758
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:18,080
Where you spend this number of points, you get a certain set of cards, like the Ferrari

759
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,480
packet or the Mustang packet or something like that.

760
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,400
And some were, but you still, you didn't really have to get those to enjoy the full experience

761
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,760
of the game, and there were also a lot of bonus cards that were commercially subsidized

762
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,760
or something like that.

763
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,120
Like you could get the card that had the Xbox 360 logo on it and some of that other stuff,

764
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,760
you know, so.

765
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:39,240
But how is this different from that Project Gotham 3 pack?

766
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,840
It comes because Project Gotham 3 actually is a full game without them?

767
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,840
Yeah, it's a full game.

768
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:48,040
You do not need to have these cars in order to enjoy the game.

769
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:52,000
It's kind of an added bonus if you want to buy the cars, then yeah, you can go ahead

770
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,240
and do that.

771
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:58,700
You don't need them to play online, whereas this, you will need to play online.

772
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:02,520
You will need to purchase the cars, and I also have, I don't have a problem with purchasing

773
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,120
the cars, you know, so much as I have a problem with purchasing the tracks, too.

774
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,240
I mean, that's kind of retarded.

775
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,020
Why should I have to purchase elements of this game?

776
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:14,600
What the fuck are you using the Blu-ray Disc for anyways, because it's obviously not storing

777
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,280
all these tracks and cars.

778
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:19,960
Alright, we're going to leave with a couple of chat comments here, and then we'll move

779
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,960
on here.

780
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,880
Gita in chat says, I don't really care, waiting for Need for Speed Carbon.

781
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,240
And Nintendo Maniac 64 says Excite Truck for the win.

782
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,480
So sounds like some people are just going to take their money elsewhere, we'll see.

783
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:39,400
Well anyways, there's actually some interesting stuff coming out other than Gran Turismo HD,

784
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:44,040
and that is our favorite game to talk about, Africa.

785
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,400
What the hell is Africa?

786
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:50,120
Well, that's kind of funny, because it's actually kind of what we thought it would be.

787
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:56,360
It's basically a virtual African safari, where you can take pictures and basically keep them.

788
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,000
It's Pokemon Snap with drafts.

789
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,320
Exactly, but it's not really a game, though.

790
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:10,420
It's basically a virtual safari, virtual Africa, where you get to see animals and basically

791
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:13,280
experience Africa without going to Africa.

792
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,200
Did Elton John do the music and Tim Rice the lyrics?

793
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,200
I don't know.

794
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,200
Don't care.

795
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,200
You know what?

796
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,440
I like Jumbo Safari, because you can harpoon animals.

797
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,440
It's the same thing.

798
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,520
Well, you know what I wanted?

799
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,680
That game is the shit right there.

800
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,680
I love that fucking safari game.

801
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,600
That's what this fucking Africa game needs to be.

802
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,600
Jumbo Safari!

803
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,320
Do we fucking have Jumbo Safari on the consoles anywhere?

804
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:36,040
No, but I think a Walmart in town still has one.

805
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,400
That fucking game is the shit.

806
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:41,280
I swear to God, if you have an arcade near you that has a Jumbo Safari, you need to pour

807
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,280
thousands of dollars.

808
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,280
We'll take that $900.

809
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:49,000
Real quick, in-studio, I have the trailer running right now for Africa, and granted,

810
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,320
it looks fucking amazing.

811
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,920
Yeah, it's pretty.

812
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,120
It's very pretty, but the thing is, it's like, what the hell is this?

813
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:01,120
It's Africa, and there's grass.

814
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,120
It's the barons.

815
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,000
And there's birds and stuff.

816
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
It's Chuck Norris.

817
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,560
Yes, it's the barons without Chuck Norris jokes.

818
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,560
What more do you need?

819
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:13,920
So, granted, okay, great, it's Elephants, it's the Discovery Channel, you know.

820
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,200
That's basically kind of what it seems to me to be, but, I don't know, do we really

821
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,200
want, you know.

822
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,200
Peppa Lumps!

823
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,720
Do you really need to, like, buy this stuff?

824
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,480
Here's the game I would recommend buying.

825
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,160
Cabela's African Safari.

826
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:31,000
You get to go destroy, you know, elephants and rhinos and stuff.

827
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,280
Yes, they have cheetahs and stuff.

828
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:39,240
I want to see, like, the whole true circle of life where, like, they eat animals.

829
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,680
Ooh, hyenas.

830
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,040
It's Africa, and look at, they're eating animals.

831
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:47,920
Look at the cute hyena eating the carcass.

832
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,320
Then suddenly out of nowhere, crikey!

833
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,320
Oh, wait, bad taste, sorry, bad taste.

834
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,480
It's staying right through my heart!

835
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,480
Bad taste.

836
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,120
Oh, the hippo wiggling his little ears.

837
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,120
It looks great.

838
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,040
I mean, this looks really, really good.

839
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,960
It's just, I think that, you know, they should do, maybe this is just the opening movie,

840
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,960
like how often do we get pissed off at that?

841
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,200
Like, you know, you see the opening movie, and then, like, the game looks nothing like

842
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,200
it.

843
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,200
You know what I mean?

844
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,360
Oh, you mean, like, kind of like, oh, I don't know, Motorstorm?

845
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,080
Ooh, pretty.

846
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:22,440
So granted, okay, this is, you know, really cool and stuff, but I don't know, I don't

847
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,440
know if this-

848
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,440
It does look amazing.

849
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,440
I mean, graphically, it's, but yeah, what the hell is it?

850
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,400
It's like, I don't need tech demos as a fucking game.

851
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,960
Yeah, you're just-

852
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:31,960
Dan?

853
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:32,960
Wait a minute.

854
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:33,960
They cut it off before he ate the gazelle!

855
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,440
Aren't you the same person that said you were wanting to get a copy of Wii Play from Japan?

856
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,440
Yeah, because that's fun.

857
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,440
I don't want tech demos as a game.

858
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:45,520
Yeah, tech demos as in, like, okay, here's ducks, okay, and look at the ducks.

859
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,880
Oh my god, Jeremy Todd 1 is great.

860
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,880
What do you say?

861
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:53,480
In Africa, you will be able to hunt down your favorite species of rare animals and take

862
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,480
pictures of them.

863
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,840
On rare nights, usually nights with a full moon, you will be able to see Chuck Norris

864
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,360
running around killing elephants with his bare hands.

865
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:04,400
Take a picture for massive damage.

866
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,400
That was beautiful.

867
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,400
That's great.

868
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,720
You win the chatroom cookie.

869
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:15,340
Well, like I said, you know, it's a nice game, and you know, I hope that there's more to

870
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:18,040
it than just, you know, look at the pretty animals.

871
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:23,560
Well, I don't know, I'm looking, you know, I sort of think that I would play that, but

872
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:28,760
then again, I also did play a whole bunch of Pokemon Snap, but you know, something that

873
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:36,520
I will play, because I'm probably going to get a PS3, is Ninja Gaiden coming out on PS3.

874
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:43,040
According to Famitsu, there is going to be one called Ninja Gaiden Sigma, which you will

875
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:48,600
play as Rachel from Ninja Gaiden Black.

876
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:54,560
And it was actually also revealed that Itagaki was saying that there was going to be a Ninja

877
00:45:54,560 --> 00:46:00,920
Gaiden 2, and it wasn't stating that it was the same project.

878
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:07,960
There's also a theory that this is going to be a remake of Ninja Gaiden Black with extras.

879
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:12,800
And there's also been no statement on if it's going to be specific just to the PS3 or if

880
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,120
it will see multiple systems.

881
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,880
I think it'll see multiple systems.

882
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:16,880
Probably.

883
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:24,520
I know Ninja Gaiden Black did really well on the Xbox, so I wouldn't see why they wouldn't

884
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,920
try to make a 360 version.

885
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,000
They've got a fan base.

886
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Exactly.

887
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,840
There was actually some pretty cool stuff from Tokyo Game Show this week.

888
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:38,920
Microsoft is doing this brand new Bring It Home.

889
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:42,520
They're covering both Tokyo Game Show and X06, which is going to be taking place in

890
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:45,240
Barcelona next week.

891
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:50,400
Some pretty cool stuff though so far, we've had some demos, videos, themes, mainly just

892
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,480
kind of some of the stuff you don't get to see.

893
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,160
I like the demo thing because they did it during E3 and got some pretty good demos from

894
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,160
that.

895
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,440
Hopefully you're going to see some more stuff as far as demos go.

896
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:04,760
I know that there's Sonic the Hedgehog is supposed to be next week at some point, so

897
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,320
that'd be cool.

898
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:09,920
Maybe even some more Japanese exclusive demos would be nice because I get to play those

899
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,280
anyways.

900
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,440
Just stuff like that.

901
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:19,240
So I like how they're doing this and hopefully we'll see some more stuff that come out pretty

902
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,240
soon.

903
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:26,480
Well, as far as things that are coming out relatively soon, at the Tokyo Game Show, Microsoft

904
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:32,440
had a press release stating what new live arcade games were going to be coming out.

905
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:39,360
Included were Contra, Gyruss, Dig Dug, Track and Field, New Rally X, Russian Attack, Ms.

906
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:45,440
Pac-Man, and exclusive for the Japanese audience, Yaya Kung Fu.

907
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,440
That's pretty cool.

908
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:50,400
I wonder if I can play that since I have my Japanese account.

909
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,400
Don't bother.

910
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,400
I don't like Yaya Kung Fu.

911
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,480
I know a lot of people have a lot of love for that game.

912
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:59,400
I don't think it's this amazing fighting game people make it out to be.

913
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:02,080
It's what practically started the genre.

914
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,880
I'll try it.

915
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:04,880
I don't know.

916
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:05,880
Not my favorite.

917
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:09,520
I do have the free demo versions you can try out.

918
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,960
JIRUS, on the other hand, bring it.

919
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:13,960
Freaking love JIRUS.

920
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,760
I'm so there when JIRUS comes out.

921
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:23,360
Some interesting things were found out this week, or at least have been brought to light.

922
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:30,240
The fact that you can copy your Xbox Live arcade games onto a CD-R or DVD-R and be able

923
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,480
to play them on your system.

924
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,480
Why is this important?

925
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,720
Because not everyone out there has a hard drive for their system, as much as I'd like

926
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:42,240
to think so, and also that the memory units are quite limited on what you can put on there.

927
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:49,560
Now, there's a big, huge how-to on 360gamesaves.com if you want to know how to do this.

928
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,560
It's kind of funny.

929
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:55,000
One of the things that they actually have been able to do is pull off the full version

930
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:01,040
of Hexac HD, so if you don't have a hard drive, you can actually play it on your system.

931
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:08,000
It's basically as simple as bringing them into a certain directory structure on your

932
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,680
recordable media and basically popping it in, and they will populate your Xbox Live

933
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:15,400
arcade list there, which is pretty cool.

934
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:19,440
And if you do have them registered on your system, they will be the full version, otherwise

935
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,800
they are a demo.

936
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,120
So when might somebody want to actually use this?

937
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:31,440
If they don't have a hard drive, or if they're just stuck to just a simple memory unit, they

938
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:37,260
might, I don't know, if they have the extra cables or whatever to transfer them off the

939
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:41,680
memory unit onto, say, your computer, which that stuff is available out there.

940
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:45,960
I know Datel has kind of a cable for that.

941
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,260
That might be something that you can use this for.

942
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:54,520
Or say, if someone actually does the kind of not-legit thing and takes all the demos

943
00:49:54,520 --> 00:50:00,200
and puts them on a disk image and distributes that over the internet, which would be cool.

944
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:03,480
And I think that should be something that Microsoft should do anyways, because I know

945
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:08,160
that, well, I know they were trying to push their Xbox Live arcade unplugged, but this

946
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,600
way if you could download all the demos, say, to a disk image, kind of like how they have

947
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:15,680
the backwards compatibility updates, that would be pretty cool as well.

948
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,840
You can just burn it onto the disk and then pop it in there and you have all the demos

949
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:24,400
for all the games, and then you can just register them, I guess, somehow.

950
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,400
That's kind of a problem if you don't have Live, I guess.

951
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:30,120
And how is piracy going to be prevented again?

952
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:34,200
The way piracy is prevented on it is actually that you're not going to be able to...

953
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:38,920
The games are only demo versions unless it's registered to your account.

954
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:39,920
Interesting.

955
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,600
Oh, yeah, because sometimes I start up Geometry Wars and it looks like it's a demo and then

956
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,480
suddenly it switches over and it says, oh, never mind, it's a demo version.

957
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,020
Yeah, because whether the register or not is based on your account.

958
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:51,840
You can't just download a registered version.

959
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,840
Gotcha.

960
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:57,800
All right, well, speaking of the 360, we have a very exciting announcement for the 360.

961
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:01,640
At least I know a lot of our import game fans are going to love this because these were

962
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:02,640
huge games.

963
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,000
Well, they were released here too, but it seems to appeal to that same audience.

964
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Radiant Silver Gun and Ikarugan, you might recognize these two shooter titles.

965
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:17,120
Well, did you know that this was always planned to be a trilogy?

966
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:18,120
And guess what?

967
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:25,520
Treasure has announced that they will be making a third game in the series for the Xbox 360.

968
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,520
That's all we know.

969
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,520
Treasure loves us.

970
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,520
That's all we know.

971
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:33,760
We don't know when, where, how, what, we just know that Treasure's making it and it's coming

972
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,760
to the 360.

973
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,540
Dude, I love Radiant Silver Gun so much.

974
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:39,720
So now will you play your 360, Jamie?

975
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:40,720
Yes.

976
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,160
Oh, my God.

977
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:47,020
I played the hell out of Radiant Silver Gun at that one arcade in Las Vegas before they

978
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,240
shut down.

979
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,920
I was like, Radiant Silver Gun.

980
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,680
Everyone else was all playing Mambo A Go Go.

981
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,880
I'm like, screw that.

982
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:54,880
Radiant Silver Gun.

983
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,080
They couldn't get me off the machine.

984
00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:00,260
What's interesting about that, I think, is that those games are usually very vertical

985
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:06,060
in nature, yet now the Xbox 360 supports widescreen and all their games have to support widescreen.

986
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:10,400
So it's going to be interesting what all that new horizontalness does to the game, don't

987
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,400
you think?

988
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:15,560
I actually used sort of for seeing something like, what was it, Thunder Force V. Didn't

989
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:20,040
that one have a lot of the rotational, where it would go one way and then rotate the other

990
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,040
way?

991
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,920
Maybe it wasn't Thunder Force V. Maybe I'm thinking of Vinehonder.

992
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:28,520
Vinehonder did a lot of vertical and horizontal scrolling in their games.

993
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,520
And Salamander.

994
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,720
Salamander actually did both, too.

995
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,500
Maybe they'll make a new Vinehonder.

996
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:34,500
It's about time.

997
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:37,000
If they did, it'd be Vinehonder.

998
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Yeah.

999
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Anyway.

1000
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,320
So, how about some release dates, y'all?

1001
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:46,940
Of course, we will start off with our UK release dates.

1002
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:49,600
Some okay stuff, I guess.

1003
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:56,200
You know, it would help if my laptop wouldn't come unplugged when I'm trying to pull up

1004
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,200
the dates.

1005
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,200
Sorry, guys.

1006
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,800
I just got a little bit of a hang up.

1007
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:01,800
Okay.

1008
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:02,800
Yeah, the internet's acting funny tonight.

1009
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,880
Our chat room's all crazy tonight, so live radio, folks.

1010
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,360
The internet's not acting funny for me.

1011
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:12,480
The fact that my computer came unplugged and my battery was going WTF.

1012
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,640
Okay.

1013
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:17,560
So how about our UK release dates, take two?

1014
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:23,900
On the 25th, which it probably already is in the UK, Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2, March

1015
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,640
of the Minis, coming out.

1016
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:33,720
On the 29th, 42 all-time classics coming out on the DS, Age of Empires, Age of Kings, Black

1017
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:40,680
Buccaneer on PC, Xbox, and Playstation 2, Company of Heroes on PC, Devil May Cry 3,

1018
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:47,640
Dante's Awakening, Special Edition, that's a cool game, guys, get it, Infrared, and Kingdom

1019
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:52,080
Hearts 2 coming out on Playstation 2, Mercury Meltdown also.

1020
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,880
On the 30th, Mad Tracks coming out on Xbox 360.

1021
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,600
Excellent.

1022
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,200
There's some pretty cool stuff coming out.

1023
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:04,040
I hope Mad Tracks is coming out, because that'd be pretty awesome, I want to play that.

1024
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:12,360
Four, of course, I gotta mention this first, the big game for Playstation 2 this week,

1025
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:16,440
Dance Dance Revolution, Supernova, of course, will be coming out.

1026
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,800
I have heard, though, that the bundle might be delayed, so if you don't have a dance

1027
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:25,480
pad yet, which I don't see why you wouldn't, you might be waiting a little bit.

1028
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:31,880
Of course, on the Playstation 2, we also have, or actually, Playstation 2, Xbox, the 360,

1029
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:37,840
and PSP, NBA Live 07, and then if you're not a fan of Live, NBA 2K7 is coming out on

1030
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,280
Playstation 2, Xbox, and the 360.

1031
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:44,800
If you're not a fan of basketball, maybe you're a fan of racing games, in which case,

1032
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:45,920
you've got a couple things.

1033
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,680
The first one's going to be The Fast and the Furious on Playstation 2, loosely based

1034
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:58,680
on Tokyo Drift, and Import Tuner Challenge on the Xbox 360, which there was a rumor that

1035
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:04,280
that was going to be $29.99 at Best Buy, that is a typo.

1036
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:09,640
Then of course, Just Cause will be coming out on Xbox 360, the Xbox, and Playstation

1037
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:15,320
2, as well as the PC, and some other fun stuff.

1038
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:20,440
On the GameCube, Beethoven Kato's Origins will be coming out, one of the last role-playing

1039
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:24,760
games actually made by Nintendo for the GameCube, so check that out.

1040
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:30,260
As well as, the Game Boy Advance will be getting some re-releases, including Pokémon Fire

1041
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:39,060
Red as part of the Greatest Hits, and Leaf Green, and of course, there's some pretty

1042
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:41,760
good stuff coming out.

1043
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,680
Import Bold Move Street Racing, if you're a racing fan on the Playstation 2, kind of

1044
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:49,760
a budget game, and Greg Hastings' Tournament Paintball Max, which the game is about a year

1045
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:56,240
old now, but still, you might want to play it in Valkyrie Profile 2, Cymera, on the Playstation

1046
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,240
2.

1047
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:00,120
Alright, well this is the part of the show where I would do Japanese release dates, but

1048
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:03,840
the site I get Japanese release dates from is not working right now.

1049
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:04,840
No problem then.

1050
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:05,840
Oh, do you have it?

1051
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,360
No, I'll just talk about some other stuff then.

1052
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:11,400
Well no, I do remember too, because I remember looking at it and going, oh, I want to import

1053
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,400
those.

1054
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,840
Pop'n Music Carnival is this week in Japan, so if you're a big Pop'n Music fan, you've

1055
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:20,000
got a new game coming out in Japan, and I know the first game in the new.hack series

1056
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,440
is coming out this week, so if you were a fan of the.hack games,.hack infection, etc.,

1057
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,680
the new series begins this week in Japan.

1058
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,960
Sorry guys, I'll try to get the rest of them later in the show if they come up later.

1059
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,840
I just think that's plenty, a game about an MMO.

1060
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:38,840
And the game, like we like to do every week, a little piece of under the radar type of

1061
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:43,400
stuff, we've got some dates for you for brand new games coming out from a company that I

1062
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:48,280
really haven't heard of, Axis Games Localization, I guess they specialize in porting over some

1063
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,280
stuff from Japan.

1064
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:54,160
Some of the things you're going to see way distant future here, Guilty Gear for the Wii

1065
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:59,200
is going to be coming out September 27th of next year, as well as a generic fishing game

1066
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:09,200
on July 18th of 07, GISH for the PSP is coming out February 28th of 07, as well as a Guilty

1067
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:16,000
Gear title for the Playstation 2, entitled right now Guilty Gear Series, but I guess

1068
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,340
that's a working title for that, and that's coming out January 2nd, so look for those.

1069
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:26,040
If you are in the market for some Xbox 360 games, there's been a few price drops, Quake

1070
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:31,920
4 has dropped down to $39.99, as well as X-Men, the official game of the movie, has also dropped

1071
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:38,320
down for $39.99, so check those out.

1072
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,320
Alright, I will.

1073
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:43,280
Okay, cool.

1074
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:48,400
Anyways, other games that Japan is going to be seeing, and we're definitely going to be

1075
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:53,160
seeing at some point, Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops, one of the cool things though that we

1076
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:58,400
probably won't ever see over here, is going to be a Portable Ops bundle for the PSP, because

1077
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:02,840
they're really trying to sell the PSP since they're getting their asses handed to them

1078
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:07,160
by Nintendo with a DS.

1079
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:16,840
The wonderful little bundle is going to include a snakeskin patterned case, as well as the

1080
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:20,400
game and a fun little box that come with everything.

1081
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:25,520
So if you haven't gotten a PSP already and you're thinking about doing so, definitely

1082
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:26,520
check it out.

1083
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:29,320
Kind of the box of cigarettes and snakes' favorite brand?

1084
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,320
No?

1085
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:31,320
Yeah.

1086
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:37,520
Well, actually, it does come with an additional pouch with the logo for the game on it as

1087
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:45,000
well, but other than that, no real any additional bonuses to it, other than kind of a cool looking

1088
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,480
PSP box.

1089
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,320
Airsoft sniper rifle, you know.

1090
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:57,720
Anyway, well speaking of very cool things, Guitar Hero is going to be making it to multiple

1091
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:03,720
formats in 2007, so that means that y'all who missed out are going to be having your

1092
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,540
second chance.

1093
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:14,700
It has been announced by the chairman of Activision that, and this is a quote, that it will appear

1094
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:22,560
on every significant new format, while also going into some of the information about their

1095
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:29,160
general plan from what it looks like, as far as some of their other titles.

1096
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:34,200
There hasn't been an official comment by Red Octane, but they did state 2007, and also

1097
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:37,800
Guitar Hero 2 is supposed to be out in November.

1098
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,960
Doesn't that seem like a vague statement, though?

1099
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,840
Every significant new platform?

1100
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:44,320
Well, what's their idea of significant?

1101
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:45,320
Exactly.

1102
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,320
Maybe they just mean...

1103
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,320
Maybe they like the Wonderswan.

1104
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:50,800
Yeah, maybe they just mean it ain't coming for the Phantom, sorry.

1105
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:55,800
Do not say hoo about the Wonderswan, because it had the best home version of Beatmania.

1106
00:59:55,800 --> 01:00:00,080
Well, best portable version of Beatmania.

1107
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:03,300
Is this too much Guitar Hero?

1108
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,520
Is this going to be an oversaturation of the market?

1109
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,520
Nah.

1110
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,520
Eh?

1111
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,520
Yes.

1112
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:09,520
Yes?

1113
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:10,920
I just thought I'd say that.

1114
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:17,680
I think so, because really, I think Guitar Hero is going to go the same path as Guitar

1115
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:23,680
Freaks, where even though they still make tons of games for that, it's just, what are

1116
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:24,680
you going to have?

1117
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:28,320
You're not really going to be able to innovate on the gameplay any, so it's just going to

1118
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:36,520
be brand new music each time around, and I guess DDR does change each game a little bit,

1119
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:37,520
at least.

1120
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,400
They change some of the gameplay stuff to it.

1121
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:43,560
I mean, can't really change too much, because, I mean, the game is pretty simple, but they

1122
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:48,720
do change a little bit of the, you know, kind of bonus type games, instead of the challenge

1123
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:53,760
modes and stuff like that, so I guess they could add some of that in there, maybe?

1124
01:00:53,760 --> 01:01:00,040
I think they should do, like what Namco did with Soul Calibur II, is, you know, where

1125
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:04,100
Soul Calibur II had different special characters on each game.

1126
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:08,280
They have a certain packet of songs on each game that's exclusive to just that one.

1127
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:09,280
God, no.

1128
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,720
Buy them all.

1129
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:12,720
Don't do that.

1130
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:15,540
Yeah, but wouldn't that sell more games?

1131
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:16,540
I don't know.

1132
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:17,960
I think, you know, it would be sad.

1133
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:20,080
I did own every version of Soul Calibur II.

1134
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:24,680
I want to see how well II does, because, I mean, II, people are going to be having, you

1135
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:29,920
know, the buy II, and they're going to be just like, they might just go, you know, okay,

1136
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,040
I've seen this before, you know, who knows?

1137
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,040
I don't know.

1138
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:35,440
I think it's got a huge enough fan base, the game's going to do very well.

1139
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:39,220
I think the game's going to do very, very well this Christmas.

1140
01:01:39,220 --> 01:01:40,380
What do I know?

1141
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:45,640
I do know that an interesting story that somewhat relates to this is that a very interesting

1142
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:46,640
purchase has been made.

1143
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:51,360
Of course, a while ago, it kind of, you know, turned heads when Activision acquired Red

1144
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:52,360
Octane.

1145
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:56,400
Well, now, the other half of Guitar Hero is Harmonix.

1146
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:57,880
They're the ones that actually developed the game.

1147
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:04,640
Red Octane publishes it, but Harmonix developed it, and MTV Networks has purchased Harmonix.

1148
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:05,640
Very interesting.

1149
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:06,640
Yes, earlier this week.

1150
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:07,640
Of the evil empire.

1151
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:12,480
MTV announced a definitive agreement to acquire Harmonix Music Systems, developer of Guitar

1152
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,080
Hero, on behalf of MTV.

1153
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:19,240
Under the terms of the transaction, MTV acquires all of the outstanding stock of Harmonix for

1154
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:21,680
$175 million in cash.

1155
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:26,120
Harmonix shareholders may be eligible for incremental earn-out payments through 2008

1156
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:30,100
to the extent that financial results exceed specific targets.

1157
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:34,200
This is to demonstrate MTV's commitment to music.

1158
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:37,000
You could play videos if you want to demonstrate that.

1159
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:42,480
And furthers its strategy of engaging passionate music fans through a deep and immersive multi-platform

1160
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,160
entertainment experience.

1161
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,980
Summary, we're screwed.

1162
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:52,560
By the way, this means that MTV Games logo will soon show up on Guitar Hero.

1163
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,520
Should be interesting.

1164
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:58,240
But could it allow them to get better licenses for the game?

1165
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:03,320
Possibly, but I can't really see the game getting much better if MTV's label is lapped

1166
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:04,320
on it.

1167
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:07,640
Can they finally get Metallica?

1168
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:08,640
I don't know.

1169
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:11,880
Metallica can be kind of pissy when it comes to their music.

1170
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,760
They're a little bit anal, but they're fine.

1171
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,160
However, they are now on iTunes.

1172
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,960
They are the divas of rock.

1173
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:18,960
Seriously.

1174
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:19,960
Alright.

1175
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:20,960
Anyways.

1176
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:28,920
Well, there's other music games out there, especially if you're in the UK.

1177
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:33,900
One of those is going to be Sing Star Rocks, which Sony has announced the playlist for

1178
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:40,880
this, including such wonderful tracks as The Killers, Somebody Told Me, Gwen Stefani Cool,

1179
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:48,280
Fall Out Boy, Dance Dance, Coldplay, The Speed of Sound, as well as many other fun little

1180
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:53,040
tracks there, Elton John, Rocketman, for all those who want to do a wonderful impression

1181
01:03:53,040 --> 01:04:00,740
of William Shatner, DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, Summertime, which I think is

1182
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:03,720
pretty cool, Blur Song 2.

1183
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:04,720
Blur!

1184
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:11,600
Let's see, here's some other good- The resident Damon Auburn fangirl is going- Scissor Sisters,

1185
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:19,600
Take Your Mama, The Police, Every Breath You Take, Stalker Song, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Sweet

1186
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:27,080
Home Alabama, and just other fun stuff, Good Charlotte, Girls and Boys.

1187
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:30,160
I remember playing that Sing Star game at E3.

1188
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:31,720
Did you really?

1189
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:33,980
We did Ace of Spades, me and some guy.

1190
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:37,080
I think you guys were off doing that when we were looking at the Eye of Judgment.

1191
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:40,640
Yeah, you guys were off doing the Eye of Judgment, and I was like, I want to play this.

1192
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,280
Ooh, they have Motorhead.

1193
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:46,080
Yeah, I remember at E3, because we were like, oh, we have to see this Eye of Judgment, because

1194
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:49,920
it's supposed to be this revolutionary new thing, and you're like, oh, they did Sing

1195
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:50,920
Star.

1196
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:54,280
And then you come out of Sing Star and you're like, eeh, and then we come out of Eye of

1197
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:56,040
Judgment, we're like, what the fuck was that?

1198
01:04:56,040 --> 01:05:00,200
I'm on a giddy after freaking blocking out to Motorhead at E3.

1199
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,600
It's 15 minutes, I won't get back.

1200
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:08,680
And then, hey, DMN, shut up, no ooh, Alabama, it's ooh, Alabama, because Alabama rocks.

1201
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:12,320
One of the really assless people at the Eye of Judgment booth is like, what the hell is

1202
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:13,320
this for?

1203
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:16,600
You tried to, and they totally were like, ignoring you at one point, because you were

1204
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:21,920
totally like, what the hell is this thing?

1205
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:22,920
Good times.

1206
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:26,760
Too bad there won't be an E3 next year, or, I'm sorry, in its current form.

1207
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:30,020
Anyway, chat rooms yelling and bitching, I need to make this crush, and the MTV logo

1208
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:32,080
already appears on Guitar Hero 1.

1209
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:37,720
Sorry, I haven't, the last time I played Guitar Hero 1 was at E3, because it was one of the

1210
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:41,960
games they had at Arena, and you know, it seems like every time you go into Arena, somebody's

1211
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:45,360
playing Guitar Hero, so that's the last time I played it, and I didn't get to see the boot

1212
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:46,800
up sequence at that time.

1213
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:51,720
So maybe the signs of this acquisition were a long time coming then, you could infer from

1214
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:52,720
that.

1215
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,440
So, sorry for my oversight, you can flog me later.

1216
01:05:54,440 --> 01:06:00,080
I'm sure that the MTV logo being on the game is only going to make the game better.

1217
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:03,160
Ooh, MTV!

1218
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:05,040
Instantly my brain has turned to jello!

1219
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:10,000
If anything, all it will do is help promote the game, that's about it, they will be able

1220
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:15,400
to promote it more on their shows, and do their own Guitar Hero, be a Guitar Hero TV

1221
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,680
contest thing, or whatever, I don't know.

1222
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:21,840
Having the MTV logo on Guitar Hero makes it lose instant cool points.

1223
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:24,560
Repeat what you said, Drew Nami, because you didn't have a mic.

1224
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:27,760
Ooh, we might just be playing the jackass theme on Guitar Hero.

1225
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:33,360
Or yeah, they'll combine some of their franchises here, you know, what is that show, My Sweet

1226
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:37,760
Sixteen Guitar Hero, whatever that fucking show is with the spoiled brats.

1227
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,120
Hi, guess he doesn't watch TV.

1228
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:43,240
You know what, I don't watch it very much either, but it's kind of one of those things

1229
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:48,960
when your roommate's watching Next, you can't help but kind of look and go, God damn, I

1230
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:51,080
weep for the youth of America.

1231
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:55,000
It's okay, what's next, we gonna see Beavis and Butthead in the crowd?

1232
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:59,080
That would be cool, that would be cool, because I like Beavis and Butthead.

1233
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:00,080
Actually that would be cool.

1234
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:05,240
Or like have like some sort of like New Age thing, no not New Age, like New Wave and then

1235
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:07,280
have like Daria hanging out on the side.

1236
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,280
Or Nine Inch Nails concert.

1237
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:13,920
Geeta in our chat room says, this is the true story of seven gamers picked to play a game

1238
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:18,320
and have their lives taped.

1239
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:23,160
Pull the gun trigger now, point it in my head and pull the trigger.

1240
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:26,480
Moving on to other music game news, this is a little bit exciting, but yet at the same

1241
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:27,480
time disappointing.

1242
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:33,920
Word is coming via joystick from their hands on of Parappa the Rappa on the PSP.

1243
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:38,560
The PSP demo for Parappa the Rappa, which we reported last week is coming to the PSP,

1244
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:43,920
it's the exact same demo that the PS1 Parappa the Rappa used, which makes us think Parappa

1245
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:49,360
the Rappa on PSP is just going to be a frickin port of Parappa the Rappa PlayStation.

1246
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:53,320
And while Parappa the Rappa is a great game and it'll help expose it to a new generation,

1247
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:57,920
old school fans like myself and I'm sure the others in this room can't help but weep a

1248
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,160
little bit at this news.

1249
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:04,440
Now there is some silver lining to this, the graphics have been cleaned up, the audio is

1250
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:10,040
a little bit crisper, the rapping guy Parappa of course still stutters, you know when you

1251
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:13,100
don't hit the buttons right, but I think that's kind of what they're supposed to do.

1252
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:18,180
Now supposedly though there is going to be a multiplayer mode, which could, you know,

1253
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:20,640
make this game the must own, I don't know.

1254
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:24,400
But it should also be pointed out that there's cute little Parappa stickers for the PSP and

1255
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:30,080
I look at that and I go I want one right now, right now, that's hot.

1256
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:33,240
Consumer horror, and hell.

1257
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:39,920
Alright we're going to bring this part A to a close here, but first we've got DDR sneak

1258
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:44,320
peeks for you guys, that's right here on Orange Launch Radio, we've been previewing new DDR

1259
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:48,440
games that are coming out very soon, UltraMix 4 a little later this year as well as DDR

1260
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:54,320
Universe sometime this winter at some point and we've been playing about four songs a

1261
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:56,280
week and we're going to continue that tonight.

1262
01:08:56,280 --> 01:09:00,640
We've got two songs from DDR UltraMix 4 and DDR Universe to play for you guys.

1263
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:03,560
Let's start it off with a long version because we've been throwing some long versions in

1264
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:04,560
here.

1265
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:08,420
This is a song that's going to be included in DDR UltraMix 4 and it's by an artist named

1266
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:13,120
Rupesh Kartel and this I believe is a license from the A Different Drum label and this is

1267
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:14,120
a pretty cool song.

1268
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:19,360
It's called Yours to Command, it's a little bit of a slow jam, enjoy this one here on

1269
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:20,360
Orange Launch Radio, DDR sneak peeks.

1270
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:41,640
I was deleting all connections to life in this town, sitting questioning just about

1271
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:57,560
everything I've tried and I didn't need solutions, you'd be wanting me to buy, as the ring fell

1272
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:15,920
on the ground.

1273
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:34,360
Out in the quiet on the wet streets, reflecting red and blue

1274
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:50,360
Setting off to see while nothing old and nothing new From the east side to the west side, I'm moving in the calm Here are pieces I've been missing for so long

1275
01:10:50,360 --> 01:11:08,860
Come in determination, I'm yours to command Come true intimidation, I'm yours to command

1276
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:24,860
Come in determination, I'm yours to command I'm yours to command

1277
01:11:38,860 --> 01:12:03,860
Come true determination, I'm yours to command

1278
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:32,860
Come in determination, I'm yours to command Come true intimidation, I'm yours to command

1279
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:39,860
From DDR UltraMix IV, that is Rupesh Cartel with Yours to Command here on Orange Lounge Radio, the DDR Sneak Peaks.

1280
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:42,860
Kind of 80s reminiscent, that song. That's kind of cool.

1281
01:12:42,860 --> 01:12:47,860
It'll probably have a pretty easy step chart, but that's okay. The noobs need something to play, and that's a good song, I think.

1282
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:55,860
Alright, we're going to go and do another song, and this song is from DDR Universe, and I have a feeling this might be a little bit of a controversial song,

1283
01:12:55,860 --> 01:13:02,860
because they've taken an old Konami classic and really remixed the heck out of it, so it's interesting.

1284
01:13:02,860 --> 01:13:09,860
Imagine your favorite gothic whipping game of all time with a big band swing sound.

1285
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:16,860
Yeah, I'm not even kidding. It's Castlevania, the freestyle and mix, wave group featuring Nicky G.

1286
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:20,860
See what you think. This is coming to DDR Universe here on the Orange Lounge Radio Sneak Peaks.

1287
01:13:20,860 --> 01:13:27,860
This is coming to DDR Universe here on the Orange Lounge Radio Sneak Peaks.

1288
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:57,860
This is coming to DDR Universe.

1289
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:27,860
This is coming to DDR Universe.

1290
01:14:50,860 --> 01:15:10,860
Castlevania, the freestyle and mix here on Orange Lounge Radio, DDR Sneak Peaks.

1291
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:14,860
Kind of interesting. I haven't heard anything quite like that before.

1292
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:20,860
I've heard plenty like it. I have the Saturn version of Symphony of the Night, or I should say Nocturne in the Moonlight,

1293
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:26,860
and if you play as Richter or Maria when you go into the lobby there of the castle,

1294
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:31,860
you actually get either Vampire Killer or I think Bloodlines, depending on who you play.

1295
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:36,860
I think Maria gets Vampire Killer, and it's sort of a similar mix to that.

1296
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:43,860
Also, that style of music has shown up in Dracula X on the PC Engine Duo.

1297
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:50,860
But you can't help but imagine Alucard in the shiny jacket getting down all BG style, right?

1298
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:53,860
This is nothing new from Konami.

1299
01:15:53,860 --> 01:15:57,860
Interesting mixed reaction from the chat room there to that, though,

1300
01:15:57,860 --> 01:15:59,860
because I bet a lot of people probably haven't heard that same thing you have,

1301
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:00,860
and some people in the chat room are kind of like...

1302
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:02,860
Bloody Tears, that was the other one.

1303
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:06,860
That's a little bit of a weird sound, but some other people are like, wow, I really dig that.

1304
01:16:06,860 --> 01:16:10,860
It's like most DDR song lists. There's going to be some songs you love and some songs you don't like so much,

1305
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:11,860
but there's something for everyone.

1306
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:15,860
That was right, Maria gets Bloody Tears, and that was...

1307
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:17,860
I haven't played that game in like a year.

1308
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:21,860
Chat room is also yelling that we're not acknowledging Supernova that's coming out next week,

1309
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:25,860
and should I point out, Loki actually already mentioned it, hello, in his upcoming releases,

1310
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:28,860
but you guys already have heard the Supernova VR at this point.

1311
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:30,860
We don't have anything new for you regarding that,

1312
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:35,860
but we do have something new for you from DDR UltraMix 4, another track here.

1313
01:16:35,860 --> 01:16:39,860
This is a song called Electric Air, and it's by an artist called Amit,

1314
01:16:39,860 --> 01:16:42,860
and it's a simple four-letter name there, A-M-I-T, Amit,

1315
01:16:42,860 --> 01:17:10,860
and it's called Electric Air here on the DDR Sneak Previews. Check it out, Orange Launch Radio.

1316
01:17:42,860 --> 01:17:59,860
I see a rush in the shade, yeah

1317
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:28,860
That was Electric Air by Amit here on Orange Launch Radio, DDR Sneak Peaks.

1318
01:18:28,860 --> 01:18:33,860
One more song for you guys tonight, and if you guys played DDR UltraMix 2,

1319
01:18:33,860 --> 01:18:38,860
or heck, if you've played some of those import mixes from Japan of BeatMania 2DX,

1320
01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:43,860
then you might know a little song called Toe Jam that was a very interesting little song,

1321
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:46,860
kind of a little bit of country hoedown by Big Idea.

1322
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:52,860
Well, guess what? Big Idea is back in DDR universe, and so is Toe Jam.

1323
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:56,860
This is our last song tonight. It's Big Idea with Return of the Toe Jam

1324
01:18:56,860 --> 01:18:59,860
here on the Orange Launch Radio Sneak Peaks.

1325
01:19:56,860 --> 01:20:06,860
Big Idea with Return of the Toe Jam

1326
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:46,860
Return of the Toe Jam by Big Idea coming soon to DDR universe.

1327
01:20:46,860 --> 01:20:48,860
That was cool.

1328
01:20:48,860 --> 01:20:57,860
I expect Minnie Pearl to come out towards the end of that song and go, hi!

1329
01:20:57,860 --> 01:21:03,860
It's interesting, I think a lot of the songs we've played tonight kind of have this common theme

1330
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:08,860
where some people probably really liked it and some people didn't like it so much,

1331
01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:13,860
but hopefully there was one of those four, at least if not three, that you really dug.

1332
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:19,860
Me personally, I kind of dug them all. Trust me, if I thought one of them sucked, I'd tell you,

1333
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:23,860
but I think they're all pretty cool, so the game should be interesting.

1334
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:30,860
I have actually done square dancing when I was younger, much younger.

1335
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:33,860
Now that's what Konami needs, square dance revolution.

1336
01:21:33,860 --> 01:21:35,860
Square dancing is actually kind of fun.

1337
01:21:35,860 --> 01:21:38,860
You know what? I used to look forward to that in P.E.,

1338
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:41,860
because it was like, hey, we were in the gym for two weeks.

1339
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:47,860
DJ Tyrant said that song delivers. I wonder if he means deliverance.

1340
01:21:47,860 --> 01:21:49,860
Yeah, real pretty ass.

1341
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:54,860
Yeah, when the DDR announcer tells me to squeal like a pig, that's when I'm going to stop playing.

1342
01:21:54,860 --> 01:21:57,860
I actually haven't square danced since I was in fourth grade, by the way.

1343
01:21:57,860 --> 01:21:59,860
Really? We did it in high school.

1344
01:21:59,860 --> 01:22:03,860
Konami, are you listening? Square dance revolution, make it happen, come on.

1345
01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:06,860
They gave us karaoke revolution country.

1346
01:22:06,860 --> 01:22:08,860
Karaoke revolution country sold, didn't it?

1347
01:22:08,860 --> 01:22:11,860
We had it at E3, though, so I could sing Good Old Boys.

1348
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:12,860
Oh, give me a break.

1349
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:15,860
To get my Dukes of Hazzard on.

1350
01:22:15,860 --> 01:22:19,860
I think I played it at Konami Gamers' Day and there was some Shania song.

1351
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:21,860
I sung it, I think. I can't remember.

1352
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:23,860
Shania is awesome.

1353
01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:25,860
Do I even know you two anymore?

1354
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:26,860
Apparently.

1355
01:22:26,860 --> 01:22:28,860
Dude, line dancing revolution. See, there's a difference.

1356
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:36,860
Line dancing is kind of like stupid cheerleading para para, but square dancing is kind of cool.

1357
01:22:36,860 --> 01:22:40,860
Alright, we need to go take a break so we can reminisce some more.

1358
01:22:40,860 --> 01:23:06,860
So that's going to do it for our part A, but we'll be back in a little bit with part B of our podcast.
