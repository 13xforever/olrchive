00:00:13,905 --> 00:00:26,518
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, September 24th, 2006, PlayStation 3 reaction from the Tokyo Game Show, the cult shooter classic is about to get a sequel, and the company that makes music game controllers sues someone over music game controllers.

2
00:00:32,918 --> 00:00:34,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everybody out there on the internet.

3
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:37,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome once again to Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:43,280
[SPEAKER_02]: We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, and the gamer culture and lifestyle.

5
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,660
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts.

6
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,700
[SPEAKER_02]: You might know me as Sky.

7
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Miss Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:50,661 --> 00:00:51,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Rawr.

9
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:51,822
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?

10
00:00:52,382 --> 00:00:52,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Rawr.

11
00:00:52,942 --> 00:00:53,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Rawr.

12
00:00:54,322 --> 00:00:54,722
[SPEAKER_07]: Rawr.

13
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:55,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Zip.

14
00:00:56,842 --> 00:00:58,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Or ARJ if you're old school.

15
00:00:58,983 --> 00:00:59,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Rawr.

16
00:00:59,503 --> 00:00:59,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Rawr.

17
00:01:01,953 --> 00:01:05,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Also say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

18
00:01:05,776 --> 00:01:05,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

19
00:01:06,276 --> 00:01:06,737
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?

20
00:01:09,198 --> 00:01:09,839
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm frustrated.

21
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:10,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

22
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Because certain things aren't working the way they should be.

23
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:14,663
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

24
00:01:15,363 --> 00:01:16,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you hate that?

25
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:17,305
[SPEAKER_03]: I do hate that.

26
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:20,827
[SPEAKER_02]: How things are described is very simple, yet never are.

27
00:01:21,888 --> 00:01:22,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to life.

28
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:23,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's your manual.

29
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Also say hello to joining us tonight once again.

30
00:01:28,126 --> 00:01:29,127
[SPEAKER_02]: 7-Zip is the wave of the future, dammit

31
00:01:56,505 --> 00:02:15,475
[SPEAKER_02]: or if you want to hear the whole thing in bulk you can listen to us live when we record on OrangeLawnRadio.com on Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time or you can listen to our rebroadcast live of Parts A and B that plays on All Games Radio over at AllGames.com and that plays Monday nights at 5 o'clock Pacific or I believe 9 a.m.

32
00:02:15,695 --> 00:02:16,415
[SPEAKER_02]: on Tuesdays.

33
00:02:16,535 --> 00:02:22,018
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're an early bird you can always catch that and you can hear all the show before it hits the podcast stream.

34
00:02:22,538 --> 00:02:26,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, we're going to start off as we always do, talking about our gaming week.

35
00:02:27,042 --> 00:02:29,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Or in DarkSakura's case, perhaps her pinball week.

36
00:02:29,544 --> 00:02:29,924
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

37
00:02:30,805 --> 00:02:31,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, really.

38
00:02:31,426 --> 00:02:39,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, all I played this week was Star Trek The Next Generation Pinball, which we finally have mostly working, except for a couple of...

39
00:02:40,956 --> 00:02:44,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Really crappy soldering jobs, whoever the previous owner was.

40
00:02:44,418 --> 00:02:51,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like, oh, let's just put a bunch of goo here and solder it and let's use hot glue to put this ramp back together and all this crap.

41
00:02:51,781 --> 00:02:53,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Dan's been working on it.

42
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:54,423
[SPEAKER_04]: It's working just fine now.

43
00:02:55,143 --> 00:02:56,524
[SPEAKER_04]: And other than that, I ain't played crap.

44
00:02:56,884 --> 00:02:58,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I've been like, urgh!

45
00:02:59,185 --> 00:03:00,325
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been sick all this past week.

46
00:03:00,846 --> 00:03:02,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Pinball's still a type of game.

47
00:03:02,346 --> 00:03:03,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinball is what we had before Pong.

48
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:04,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinball!

49
00:03:10,422 --> 00:03:13,584
[SPEAKER_04]: is the backbone of the gaming community.

50
00:03:14,165 --> 00:03:17,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, them's big words there, but I would agree.

51
00:03:17,307 --> 00:03:20,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Without pinball, we would not have our arcades.

52
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,992
[SPEAKER_02]: In the gaming tree, pinball is an essential branch.

53
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:26,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinball is the root.

54
00:03:26,614 --> 00:03:27,855
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I've said it before on this show.

55
00:03:27,915 --> 00:03:33,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Pinball was something I went to the arcades to play before DDR, because I didn't play a whole lot in the arcades before that.

56
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe your occasional fighter, Street Fighter II, back when that was huge, when I was in junior high school.

57
00:03:39,256 --> 00:03:40,737
[SPEAKER_02]: using E-Honda's 100-Hand Slap.

58
00:03:40,757 --> 00:03:44,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, I was 100-Hand Slapping, bitches, long before Xbox Live, okay?

59
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:59,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I remember going back in the old days and playing Old Black Knight before it had a digital display, playing the Time Machine one before we had digital displays.

60
00:03:59,271 --> 00:03:59,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinbot.

61
00:04:00,452 --> 00:04:02,593
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, Pinbot was the shit.

62
00:04:02,914 --> 00:04:05,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Was Pinbot... I'll ask you this, then we'll move on.

63
00:04:05,796 --> 00:04:07,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Was Pinbot on the NES...

64
00:04:08,211 --> 00:04:13,796
[SPEAKER_02]: A great thing or a horrible mistransformation of the pinball experience?

65
00:04:13,996 --> 00:04:15,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Believe it or not, I didn't have it.

66
00:04:15,537 --> 00:04:22,003
[SPEAKER_04]: The first pinball games that I actually played on a home console was this, like, Gator game on the old school Game Boy.

67
00:04:22,043 --> 00:04:23,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God, Revenge of the Gator, yes.

68
00:04:23,184 --> 00:04:29,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Revenge of the Gator and Devil's Crush on TurboGrafx.

69
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:30,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ever play Pinball Quest?

70
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:30,650
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

71
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,431
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta find that.

72
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:33,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Sonic Spinball, however, was my game.

73
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:34,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Sonic Spinball was pretty awesome.

74
00:04:34,534 --> 00:04:34,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

75
00:04:34,654 --> 00:04:35,054
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you that.

76
00:04:35,814 --> 00:04:38,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Pinball Quest, though, is an interesting 8-bit title.

77
00:04:38,535 --> 00:04:42,937
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those things, like, it was a really good concept, but it was a little bit glitchy sometimes.

78
00:04:43,137 --> 00:04:44,358
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have to agree with Actdeft.

79
00:04:44,378 --> 00:04:47,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Terminator 2 pinball ruled, but we're actually trying to work on getting a Medieval Madness.

80
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:55,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you want to join our chatroom and make comments, such as that last person just did, you can join our chatroom over at www.orangelandrady.com.

81
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:56,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Click on chat.

82
00:04:56,723 --> 00:04:59,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, one thing I need to tell Jaded is that we have a Guns N' Roses now.

83
00:05:00,385 --> 00:05:00,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

84
00:05:01,104 --> 00:05:02,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan's Busy Rearranging Our Entire House

85
00:05:29,088 --> 00:05:32,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to get four pinball machines in and two maim cabinets.

86
00:05:32,429 --> 00:05:34,850
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet I still have not come over and played all these pinball machines.

87
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:35,530
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I need to.

88
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:38,731
[SPEAKER_04]: He's building me a maim cabinet out of a Tekken 3, so I'm fairly happy.

89
00:05:38,811 --> 00:05:39,331
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty hot.

90
00:05:40,191 --> 00:05:41,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, we'll move on.

91
00:05:41,371 --> 00:05:42,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

92
00:05:42,772 --> 00:05:43,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you play any pinball?

93
00:05:44,132 --> 00:05:44,712
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I did not.

94
00:05:44,892 --> 00:05:45,432
[SPEAKER_02]: That's too bad.

95
00:05:45,492 --> 00:05:46,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what did you play?

96
00:05:47,493 --> 00:05:50,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I played Saints Row and did a little bit more than that.

97
00:05:50,594 --> 00:05:51,274
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty fun.

98
00:05:52,214 --> 00:05:55,515
[SPEAKER_03]: And a little bit of Bomberman, just because I have it.

99
00:05:56,896 --> 00:05:58,096
[SPEAKER_03]: And Cookie Mama, I

100
00:05:58,905 --> 00:05:59,786
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

101
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:21,613
[SPEAKER_03]: I've gotten rid of most of my other DS games.

102
00:06:21,633 --> 00:06:28,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, tell, explain to us, you know, because there's probably a lot of people who've seen this game on the shelves, you know, it's Cookie Mama, and it's gone, what the F is that?

103
00:06:28,579 --> 00:06:29,360
[SPEAKER_02]: So what the F is that?

104
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:38,407
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically a bunch of mini-games that, you know, you play through, and depending on how you, you know, you complete them, you get a score at the end.

105
00:06:38,467 --> 00:06:43,391
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically they have different, you know, mini-games depending on what dish you're, you know, creating.

106
00:06:43,451 --> 00:06:43,611
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

107
00:06:44,232 --> 00:06:48,254
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, rice, you know, you'll have, you know, the first mini-game will be measure out the rice.

108
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:51,475
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have to measure it to a line, and you have to do it within a time limit.

109
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,536
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they have another one that's a Japanese import game, right?

110
00:06:55,257 --> 00:06:55,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

111
00:06:55,637 --> 00:06:58,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, just... So rice is the first stage?

112
00:06:58,458 --> 00:06:59,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Rice is the first stage.

113
00:06:59,458 --> 00:06:59,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

114
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:01,639
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have to measure out the water.

115
00:07:01,659 --> 00:07:02,200
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your joke here, sorry.

116
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,781
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have, you know, the stage where you have to wash the rice.

117
00:07:06,381 --> 00:07:08,962
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have the stage where you have to cook the rice.

118
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:12,324
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're all just, like, basically rhythm and, you know...

119
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kind of, like, cutting and tapping and stuff like that.

120
00:07:16,081 --> 00:07:19,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, see, wouldn't this game be more fun, though, if there was rapping in the background, you know?

121
00:07:20,002 --> 00:07:20,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Possibly.

122
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:23,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, wash the rice.

123
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:24,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Do-do-do-do-do.

124
00:07:24,823 --> 00:07:27,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, or what was the, uh, I'm the cooking chicken.

125
00:07:27,344 --> 00:07:32,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's, the problem with the game is the sensitivity is really, like, off on a lot of the games.

126
00:07:33,025 --> 00:07:36,066
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, you're really going to get frustrated with stuff.

127
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:37,992
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

128
00:07:38,412 --> 00:07:44,355
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's also some levels that don't really give you a good description of what you're supposed to do, so it's kind of hard and you get frustrated real easy.

129
00:07:44,575 --> 00:07:47,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is why Nellie stopped playing, because she couldn't figure out what the hell she was supposed to do in certain levels.

130
00:07:48,397 --> 00:07:50,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it doesn't really explain it to you.

131
00:07:50,378 --> 00:07:56,561
[SPEAKER_03]: They give you the option to practice it, but they don't really kind of take you through a tutorial to tell you how to cook.

132
00:07:57,221 --> 00:07:58,522
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just like, DO IT!

133
00:07:59,982 --> 00:08:01,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Japanese are smarter.

134
00:08:01,623 --> 00:08:04,445
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's just the way that is.

135
00:08:05,045 --> 00:08:05,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

136
00:08:05,523 --> 00:08:06,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Grand Theft Auto, Zuma, Fusion Frenzy 2

137
00:08:23,413 --> 00:08:26,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Fusion Frenzy 2 sucks balls, and I will not be buying that game.

138
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:26,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

139
00:08:27,337 --> 00:08:28,318
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked interesting for the trailer.

140
00:08:28,338 --> 00:08:29,760
[SPEAKER_03]: It was extremely lame.

141
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:30,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Extremely lame.

142
00:08:31,001 --> 00:08:31,902
[SPEAKER_03]: What was lame about it?

143
00:08:32,243 --> 00:08:33,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the games themselves are just dumb.

144
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:40,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, there's one level, it's like, we're trying to be Mario Party, but we're not even coming near Mario Party.

145
00:08:40,652 --> 00:08:43,936
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just all these mini-games that have, there's like no point to them.

146
00:08:44,987 --> 00:08:46,308
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're just dumb.

147
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:54,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, is it maybe just because it's a demo and maybe it's just not... All the other minigames, you know, are just kind of variations of these minigames.

148
00:08:54,656 --> 00:09:04,966
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like, you know, there's one of them that you're kind of these gladiator, you know, American gladiator type ball things and you're rolling around and you basically, okay, who can cover the most space with their color?

149
00:09:05,886 --> 00:09:07,508
[SPEAKER_03]: And, okay, that's kind of lame.

150
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:17,181
[SPEAKER_03]: and then there is another one where you have to pick up boxes and put them in your corner and you can steal boxes from other players it's just it screams Mario Kart but or not Mario Kart Mario Party

151
00:09:17,742 --> 00:09:19,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Without any of the actual board stuff.

152
00:09:20,064 --> 00:09:21,805
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a very lame, generic game.

153
00:09:23,366 --> 00:09:29,509
[SPEAKER_03]: And surprising enough, it's also by Hudson, which made the wonderful smash hit game Bomberman Act Zero.

154
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,610
[SPEAKER_03]: So are we surprised?

155
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, but at the same time, they also made Mario Party.

156
00:09:33,432 --> 00:09:34,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent, but you know what?

157
00:09:34,553 --> 00:09:38,695
[SPEAKER_03]: They've really sucked it up on the 360 so far, so whatever.

158
00:09:38,975 --> 00:09:40,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ever play the first one?

159
00:09:40,817 --> 00:09:41,137
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I didn't.

160
00:09:41,157 --> 00:09:42,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's an interesting comment in our chatroom here.

161
00:09:43,058 --> 00:09:46,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Mystic Gohan says, Fusion Frenzy 2 sucked, but number one owned.

162
00:09:47,372 --> 00:09:50,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe this is going to be better in a full game, but I'm not buying it.

163
00:09:50,274 --> 00:09:51,295
[SPEAKER_03]: So, whatever.

164
00:09:51,756 --> 00:09:54,938
[SPEAKER_03]: I also played the new Tenchu game, which was only available in Japan.

165
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:57,060
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's pretty cool.

166
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:03,725
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I wasn't really into Tenchu, but I like running around jumping on buildings and stuff and throwing ninja stars in the people's heads.

167
00:10:03,986 --> 00:10:04,806
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of cool.

168
00:10:04,986 --> 00:10:05,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that sounds fun.

169
00:10:05,907 --> 00:10:06,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so that's fun.

170
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:10,131
[SPEAKER_03]: The only problem about that game, because it was in Japanese... Sounds like Shinobi.

171
00:10:10,311 --> 00:10:15,335
[SPEAKER_03]: I had trouble figuring out the controls, because it is kind of difficult to figure out what you've got to do.

172
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:16,600
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

173
00:10:34,526 --> 00:10:34,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

174
00:10:35,466 --> 00:10:35,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

175
00:10:35,586 --> 00:10:37,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I've heard a lot of positive reviews elsewhere.

176
00:10:37,347 --> 00:10:38,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, the camera is blurry as fuck.

177
00:10:39,707 --> 00:10:41,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Blurry, blurry, blurry.

178
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:42,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you just do something to it?

179
00:10:42,887 --> 00:10:43,028
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

180
00:10:43,048 --> 00:10:44,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you leave the sticker on?

181
00:10:44,248 --> 00:10:46,148
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there is no sticker on this thing.

182
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,088
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there is a sticker on this thing.

183
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:50,349
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there is no sticker on this thing.

184
00:10:50,369 --> 00:10:51,669
[SPEAKER_03]: It would have been hella funny if there was.

185
00:10:51,749 --> 00:10:52,869
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, son of a bitch!

186
00:10:54,109 --> 00:10:54,289
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

187
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so, it's very blurry.

188
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very blurry.

189
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:03,031
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because it knew what you and Nellie were going to be doing with it, so it had to blur out the naughty bits.

190
00:11:04,295 --> 00:11:04,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Plugin PC Work

191
00:11:25,621 --> 00:11:27,522
[SPEAKER_03]: No, of course it's never going to be like that.

192
00:11:27,602 --> 00:11:29,463
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got the updated drivers for it.

193
00:11:29,763 --> 00:11:32,805
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny because the old drivers work kind of crappy, but they work.

194
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,546
[SPEAKER_03]: The new drivers don't work at all.

195
00:11:34,926 --> 00:11:38,328
[SPEAKER_03]: So this thing is just, it's doing nothing.

196
00:11:38,428 --> 00:11:45,232
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to have a webcam for you guys, folks, and we were going to have the wonderful webcam, but you can thank Microsoft for putting out a really shoddy camera.

197
00:11:45,652 --> 00:11:47,113
[SPEAKER_02]: What would happen if I plugged that in my Mac?

198
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,313
[SPEAKER_02]: You think it would work right away?

199
00:11:50,515 --> 00:11:52,095
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it'll just go, what the hell is this?

200
00:11:52,135 --> 00:11:53,576
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to freaking try it during the break.

201
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:54,677
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I got to try.

202
00:11:55,595 --> 00:11:56,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's the thing.

203
00:11:56,755 --> 00:11:57,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for you.

204
00:11:57,496 --> 00:11:58,296
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the thing, though.

205
00:11:58,336 --> 00:12:00,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, the generic drivers worked on it.

206
00:12:00,677 --> 00:12:01,877
[SPEAKER_03]: The new drivers do not.

207
00:12:02,378 --> 00:12:04,618
[SPEAKER_03]: So go right ahead and try that.

208
00:12:04,698 --> 00:12:05,419
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

209
00:12:06,199 --> 00:12:06,919
[SPEAKER_03]: The new drivers don't.

210
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,220
[SPEAKER_03]: So whatever.

211
00:12:10,641 --> 00:12:15,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the cool thing... You tried a video chat with me, and it was pretty blurry.

212
00:12:16,823 --> 00:12:22,625
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's interesting is that another podcaster, our old buddy Bobby, sent a picture of his kitty cat

213
00:12:23,741 --> 00:12:27,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, because you can send pictures on Xbox Live instead of messages if you want.

214
00:12:27,344 --> 00:12:29,687
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got a picture of his kitty cat and it was pretty clear.

215
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:34,431
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a little dark, like there was some contrast issues, but he probably just didn't have the right lighting behind it.

216
00:12:35,132 --> 00:12:38,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of our houses aren't set up to have lighting behind where our systems are at.

217
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:41,457
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, at least in this house, I know the lighting is like by the couch.

218
00:12:41,477 --> 00:12:43,038
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably why he has the contrast issues.

219
00:12:43,518 --> 00:12:46,919
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was sharp, unlike when we video chatted.

220
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:47,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's the thing.

221
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,541
[SPEAKER_03]: The video chat's only in 640 by 480, whereas the pictures are 1.3 megapixels.

222
00:12:52,581 --> 00:12:53,882
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, you know, the difference.

223
00:12:54,342 --> 00:12:59,424
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, it looks all blurry, but then when you take a picture, it's just, you know, supposed to be clear.

224
00:12:59,804 --> 00:13:03,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Except for your gamer tag pictures, those are still blurry as hell.

225
00:13:03,846 --> 00:13:06,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I took one, I'm like, wow, I can't see anything in that.

226
00:13:07,113 --> 00:13:13,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Then how come some of the other, like I have three other podcasters on my list who got the camera early because Microsoft likes them.

227
00:13:13,637 --> 00:13:14,198
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

228
00:13:14,338 --> 00:13:15,919
[SPEAKER_02]: And they all look fine.

229
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:17,620
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get it.

230
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,701
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the thing.

231
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,022
[SPEAKER_02]: I say take it back.

232
00:13:21,443 --> 00:13:22,203
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not my face.

233
00:13:22,463 --> 00:13:23,164
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not blurry.

234
00:13:24,225 --> 00:13:26,706
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what SSJ100Matt in chat says.

235
00:13:26,726 --> 00:13:27,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's your face, Loki.

236
00:13:27,847 --> 00:13:29,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and here's the other thing.

237
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:31,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Microsoft.

238
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,672
[SPEAKER_03]: This camera is made for cyber sex.

239
00:13:38,223 --> 00:13:40,924
[SPEAKER_03]: I showed Rob why this camera is made for cyber sex.

240
00:13:40,964 --> 00:13:41,865
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very disturbing.

241
00:13:42,605 --> 00:13:43,906
[SPEAKER_03]: And I never want to see it again.

242
00:13:45,247 --> 00:13:54,272
[SPEAKER_03]: For some reason, a feature that was added into the video chat on live, and explain to me why you would need this.

243
00:13:55,753 --> 00:14:02,977
[SPEAKER_03]: If you push the trigger buttons on your controller, it makes the other person's controller vibrate as long as you hold them down.

244
00:14:03,996 --> 00:14:08,538
[SPEAKER_03]: If that does not scream video or cyber sex, I don't know what does.

245
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:11,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Microsoft.

246
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,461
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys really thought of everything.

247
00:14:16,502 --> 00:14:19,704
[SPEAKER_03]: So, your vision camera, would I recommend buying it?

248
00:14:19,844 --> 00:14:20,384
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

249
00:14:20,545 --> 00:14:26,187
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, maybe the room I'm using in it, because I got the camera to look decent.

250
00:14:26,227 --> 00:14:33,091
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just very blurry still, but I mean, compared to the last digital camera that we had, the webcam, I guess it

251
00:14:34,015 --> 00:14:35,036
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know.

252
00:14:36,136 --> 00:14:37,696
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't just get this thing to work anymore.

253
00:14:38,157 --> 00:14:39,457
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll try it on my Xbox when we're done.

254
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,518
[SPEAKER_02]: See if maybe the different lighting in this house will help.

255
00:14:41,838 --> 00:14:42,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

256
00:14:42,238 --> 00:14:43,138
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

257
00:14:44,099 --> 00:14:45,599
[SPEAKER_03]: It's worth picking up if you can find one.

258
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:51,861
[SPEAKER_03]: I know GameStop, at least where I got mine pre-ordered at, they didn't get any extras in.

259
00:14:52,001 --> 00:14:53,342
[SPEAKER_03]: So it might be pretty hard to find.

260
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:57,723
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not getting one.

261
00:14:57,743 --> 00:14:59,224
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not interested in the vision thing?

262
00:14:59,824 --> 00:14:59,964
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

263
00:15:00,164 --> 00:15:02,525
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want the whole vibration with the controller thing?

264
00:15:03,241 --> 00:15:04,661
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of funny when he did it.

265
00:15:04,942 --> 00:15:05,702
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, what the hell?

266
00:15:05,722 --> 00:15:06,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is the controller shaking?

267
00:15:07,462 --> 00:15:08,442
[SPEAKER_02]: And Loki's like, do you feel that?

268
00:15:08,462 --> 00:15:08,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel that?

269
00:15:10,783 --> 00:15:13,344
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a PC and I actually have a real webcam.

270
00:15:14,244 --> 00:15:16,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Which nobody is giving the address to since I don't upload it to anywhere.

271
00:15:17,224 --> 00:15:21,245
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can't play Uno with a webcam on the PC.

272
00:15:21,265 --> 00:15:22,946
[SPEAKER_02]: At least I don't know any versions of it yet.

273
00:15:23,066 --> 00:15:24,706
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't touch our Xbox 360.

274
00:15:26,327 --> 00:15:27,107
[SPEAKER_02]: What about Dead Rising?

275
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:29,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I played that, but that was the last thing I played.

276
00:15:30,428 --> 00:15:31,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it was all about zombie killing.

277
00:15:33,257 --> 00:15:36,458
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been sort of not playing the 360.

278
00:15:36,598 --> 00:15:38,679
[SPEAKER_02]: No interest in Totem Ball or anything?

279
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:40,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Pinball.

280
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:41,500
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

281
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,940
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of want one, but it can also kind of wait.

282
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,541
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not something... I think I'll support many games for it right now.

283
00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:53,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I thought I would want it right away and I was kind of looking for one, but now I'm like, eh, do I really need to video chat?

284
00:15:53,363 --> 00:15:53,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

285
00:15:54,383 --> 00:15:56,064
[SPEAKER_02]: It can wait, especially after seeing Loki's.

286
00:15:56,284 --> 00:15:56,564
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

287
00:15:57,834 --> 00:15:58,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, my gaming week.

288
00:15:59,614 --> 00:16:00,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually not a lot of new stuff.

289
00:16:01,495 --> 00:16:03,515
[SPEAKER_02]: There really wasn't anything new I picked up this week.

290
00:16:03,715 --> 00:16:12,137
[SPEAKER_02]: I was interested in getting the camera at one point but I wasn't able to get it because I didn't pre-order one because I didn't think I would want it but then I was going to go look for it.

291
00:16:12,357 --> 00:16:12,837
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't have it.

292
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:22,559
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've pretty much just been watching a friend of mine play through Enchanted Arms because I showed it to a friend of mine and he's been in love with it and just over here playing it a lot.

293
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,240
[SPEAKER_02]: He got further than I did so I think he's about

294
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:55,236
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the percentage said he was like 46% of the way through the game so some of the voice acting gets a little better when you get to midway some of the voice actors are pretty good and some are still pretty bad but the game's plot got interesting it's pretty fun I think if you're a role playing fan and you happen to have a 360 you should definitely check out Enchanted Arms because there's really not a lot else for you right now on the 360 and Enchanted Arms is decent it's not a hey we made this at the last minute so we could say we have an RPG on the system it's pretty good I was pretty happy

295
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:58,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Drew Nami, how was your gaming week?

296
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,781
[SPEAKER_01]: Oddly enough, I've been playing a lot of Rez.

297
00:17:02,162 --> 00:17:02,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

298
00:17:02,862 --> 00:17:03,402
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, really.

299
00:17:04,383 --> 00:17:07,185
[SPEAKER_01]: Aside from that, I haven't been really playing that many games.

300
00:17:07,245 --> 00:17:12,228
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a break from WoW and... Oh yeah, I've been playing World of Warcraft a lot, actually.

301
00:17:12,408 --> 00:17:13,208
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in a new guild.

302
00:17:13,228 --> 00:17:13,528
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn it.

303
00:17:13,789 --> 00:17:14,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

304
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:21,053
[SPEAKER_02]: So, my friend convinced me to join the gay guild on Proudmoore, so I've been playing there a lot.

305
00:17:21,613 --> 00:17:21,973
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.

306
00:17:22,414 --> 00:17:23,054
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I took a break.

307
00:17:23,094 --> 00:17:24,035
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a little bit burned out.

308
00:17:24,435 --> 00:17:24,535
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

309
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:28,101
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

310
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:55,779
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you say to the people that say Kingdom Hearts 2 is nothing but a bunch of button mashing?

311
00:17:56,539 --> 00:17:59,680
[SPEAKER_01]: You haven't played it on proud mode, and you haven't gotten to Beast Castle Round 2.

312
00:18:01,721 --> 00:18:05,202
[SPEAKER_04]: As you said, I read some reviews that said... Even regular mode, the Demix battle.

313
00:18:06,182 --> 00:18:07,843
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Demix is just a pain in the ass.

314
00:18:07,863 --> 00:18:08,643
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just a bitch.

315
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:10,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

316
00:18:11,304 --> 00:18:15,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's go on to some housekeeping, and then we're going to... Oh, I want to mention one thing that I thought was pretty cool.

317
00:18:15,826 --> 00:18:20,127
[SPEAKER_03]: GameStop, when I went and picked up my camera, I just looked around a little bit to see if there was anything else I wanted...

318
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:26,607
[SPEAKER_03]: I found a Beatmania 2DX turntable controller for $8.

319
00:18:27,348 --> 00:18:28,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Pick that sucker up.

320
00:18:28,329 --> 00:18:29,049
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's mine.

321
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:32,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, at least I'm babysitting it for a little while because Loki hates Beatmania.

322
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:34,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I just don't have any games.

323
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:38,516
[SPEAKER_03]: At the time, I didn't have my PlayStation 2 back, but I finally got it back.

324
00:18:39,156 --> 00:18:40,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have USB Mania?

325
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:40,737
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

326
00:18:40,757 --> 00:18:41,278
[SPEAKER_02]: You can borrow that?

327
00:18:41,638 --> 00:18:46,482
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want, you can borrow my Japanese PlayStation and the various styles I own.

328
00:18:46,602 --> 00:18:47,222
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't own them all.

329
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:48,183
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got my HD letter.

330
00:18:48,203 --> 00:18:49,164
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just load the Japanese.

331
00:18:49,244 --> 00:18:49,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well.

332
00:18:50,383 --> 00:18:53,406
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll put the new 2DX that they have in Japan over there on it.

333
00:18:53,807 --> 00:18:54,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well.

334
00:18:54,447 --> 00:18:56,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me for trying to do something nice.

335
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,412
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just leave the controller here because I don't really play 2DX.

336
00:18:59,432 --> 00:19:01,014
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to play Doubles.

337
00:19:01,354 --> 00:19:02,716
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get back into 2DX and play Doubles.

338
00:19:02,736 --> 00:19:04,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Doubles Keyboard Mania was a blast.

339
00:19:04,638 --> 00:19:07,821
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you could play that in the arcade, people were like, WTF?

340
00:19:07,841 --> 00:19:08,982
[SPEAKER_02]: So many buttons.

341
00:19:09,002 --> 00:19:09,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Watching someone do 7-star.

342
00:19:14,961 --> 00:19:16,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was never as good.

343
00:19:16,342 --> 00:19:19,065
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I could get through a couple double songs, you know.

344
00:19:19,145 --> 00:19:20,026
[SPEAKER_02]: I was pretty decent.

345
00:19:20,086 --> 00:19:22,348
[SPEAKER_04]: I could do three stars, that was it, in doubles.

346
00:19:22,648 --> 00:19:25,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Who was that guy that is so good at keyboard mania?

347
00:19:25,191 --> 00:19:25,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue?

348
00:19:25,871 --> 00:19:26,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that his name?

349
00:19:26,472 --> 00:19:26,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

350
00:19:26,872 --> 00:19:33,799
[SPEAKER_02]: That guy, he can smoke those doubles that are like the maximum level, and I'll tell you what.

351
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:35,781
[SPEAKER_04]: I loved watching him play keyboard mania, though.

352
00:19:36,061 --> 00:19:36,922
[SPEAKER_02]: That gives me...

353
00:19:38,556 --> 00:19:42,158
[SPEAKER_02]: A gamer boner so much more than the 2DX and pop music videos.

354
00:19:42,178 --> 00:19:43,318
[SPEAKER_04]: He also plays piano very well.

355
00:19:43,378 --> 00:19:45,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because I like the piano music a lot more.

356
00:19:45,579 --> 00:19:49,041
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm not disrespecting the 2DX because there's a lot of impressive stuff there.

357
00:19:49,061 --> 00:19:52,262
[SPEAKER_04]: You should also see him play Pump It Up.

358
00:19:52,282 --> 00:19:53,843
[SPEAKER_04]: You should also see him do doubles on Pump It Up.

359
00:19:54,243 --> 00:19:54,483
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

360
00:19:55,804 --> 00:19:56,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Someday, someday.

361
00:19:57,305 --> 00:19:57,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Housekeeping.

362
00:19:57,965 --> 00:20:04,548
[SPEAKER_02]: First, we want to thank everybody for all the well wishes for episode 200 because we continue to kind of get them throughout the week, even after the show.

363
00:20:04,608 --> 00:20:06,789
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a couple messages on Xbox Live, which is very nice.

364
00:20:07,313 --> 00:20:35,884
[SPEAKER_02]: and I know we got some emails and some message board posts so we just wanted to say thank you guys and it was a fun show it was a long show but it was a fun show and really glad you guys that were able to join us live did or if you couldn't join us live we're glad you got through all three parts so thank you also wanted to say the DDR sneak peeks are continuing tonight those haven't stopped they'll be a little later on in this program four new tracks two from Ultramix 4 and two from Universe and also I wanted to say about this podcast

365
00:20:36,792 --> 00:20:39,794
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

366
00:21:06,051 --> 00:21:13,774
[SPEAKER_02]: is he set up a program that not only catches podcasts and automatically shares them over the network to your Xbox 360.

367
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,095
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't put them on the hard drive of the Xbox 360.

368
00:21:16,135 --> 00:21:16,875
[SPEAKER_02]: It uses the network.

369
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:20,396
[SPEAKER_02]: But what it also does is it downloads RSS feeds.

370
00:21:20,496 --> 00:21:22,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Like let's say you want to read, I don't know, Kotaku.

371
00:21:22,737 --> 00:21:29,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say you have Kotaku in your feed, and what it does is it translates the text of the RSS feed and makes it an image.

372
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,681
[SPEAKER_02]: And then so if you go through your photo gallery on Xbox 360, you can read RSS feeds.

373
00:21:35,216 --> 00:21:35,516
[SPEAKER_02]: XBeeStream.com

374
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:07,076
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

375
00:22:35,424 --> 00:22:36,585
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

376
00:22:56,673 --> 00:22:58,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we shall go into some news, shall we Jamie?

377
00:22:58,835 --> 00:22:59,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, why don't we?

378
00:22:59,595 --> 00:23:01,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, I always shake my head because, you know what I call him?

379
00:23:01,237 --> 00:23:01,817
[SPEAKER_02]: I call him Ken Crayon Eater.

380
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:32,063
[SPEAKER_04]: So apparently the price of the PlayStation 3 in Japan has been dropped.

381
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:49,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though they're still having the delays with their production, they're stating that they're going to reprice the 20 gigabyte model with an inclusion of the HDMI port for 49,980 yen, which is roughly 48 bucks in the U.S.,

382
00:23:55,131 --> 00:24:01,154
[SPEAKER_04]: about 225 pounds in the UK, which is actually a reduction from 62,790 yen.

383
00:24:01,174 --> 00:24:06,797
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a pretty significant drop, at least, you know, a couple hundred.

384
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:14,562
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're also saying that at the Tokyo Game Show there were going to be 200 playable consoles.

385
00:24:15,022 --> 00:24:19,224
[SPEAKER_04]: What I haven't found out is if they are actually still those rack-mounted servers.

386
00:24:20,265 --> 00:24:20,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they are.

387
00:24:21,305 --> 00:24:22,366
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I'm not surprised.

388
00:24:23,109 --> 00:24:35,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, one thing that was mentioned, and I found out after reading the article, a bit of a rebuttal on this, is that they're saying that the online service was going to offer Mega Drive and PC Engine titles, but Sega had something different to say about that, didn't they?

389
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:37,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they did.

390
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:46,926
[SPEAKER_03]: They said that it was something that they were considering based on the architecture of the online system, but it wasn't something that they were doing right away.

391
00:24:47,387 --> 00:24:49,348
[SPEAKER_04]: More proof that Ken Kurogi eats crayons.

392
00:24:50,616 --> 00:24:53,559
[SPEAKER_04]: However, one thing I do think is kind of cool is their global mapping system.

393
00:24:54,540 --> 00:25:02,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, what it does is you upload your pictures, data about where you live, and it makes a world map where various PS3 gamers live.

394
00:25:02,947 --> 00:25:05,389
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of neat.

395
00:25:05,789 --> 00:25:07,531
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like that one site.

396
00:25:07,571 --> 00:25:09,512
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that site?

397
00:25:09,893 --> 00:25:10,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Frapper.

398
00:25:10,393 --> 00:25:10,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

399
00:25:10,793 --> 00:25:11,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Frapper.

400
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:11,674
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a Frapper.

401
00:25:11,694 --> 00:25:13,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we have an Orange Lounge Radio Frapper.

402
00:25:13,696 --> 00:25:15,337
[SPEAKER_02]: And you should join that if you haven't already.

403
00:25:15,397 --> 00:25:17,399
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it sounds like Frapper for your PS3.

404
00:25:17,619 --> 00:25:18,600
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting that impression.

405
00:25:20,131 --> 00:25:24,076
[SPEAKER_04]: But I still think that he needs to keep the bicycle helmet on a little bit longer.

406
00:25:25,018 --> 00:25:26,840
[SPEAKER_04]: His head hasn't quite healed from that last falling.

407
00:25:28,283 --> 00:25:30,025
[SPEAKER_03]: He's still got the baby soft spot.

408
00:25:30,406 --> 00:25:31,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

409
00:25:31,708 --> 00:25:33,530
[SPEAKER_04]: His skull hasn't completely molded together.

410
00:25:33,671 --> 00:25:34,572
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are crazy.

411
00:25:36,614 --> 00:25:46,382
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting because I'm reading about the XB Stream stuff in chat because apparently some of the other podcasters who were affected by that whole thing were very vocal about it and some of our folks listen to other podcasts.

412
00:25:46,682 --> 00:25:55,229
[SPEAKER_02]: I do try to listen to other podcasts, but ever since my iPod broke last week, it's been very hard for me to listen to other podcasts, so I'm kind of behind on all the gossip on XB Stream.

413
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:58,492
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're saying, let's see, they said here,

414
00:25:59,255 --> 00:26:29,004
[SPEAKER_02]: something about GamerAndy loves XBStream I think there's a hint of sarcasm there Funnydale says XBStream nearly shut down IGN I'm not kidding and then Funnydale goes on to say wait shut down IGN on second thought I love XBStream but BlackWolf says reminds us that Tigerclaw or was saying to Tigerclaw I guess in a message here he offered to compensate for the bandwidth bills the author was like so you know oops I really made a big big mistake I'll pay for the bills I thought that was kind of nice you know so

415
00:26:30,645 --> 00:26:35,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, moving on, I wanted to say really quickly regarding the PlayStation 3.

416
00:26:36,367 --> 00:26:46,490
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an interesting series that Kotaku's been running, because they have some folks over at the show, and they've been posting these videos on YouTube asking people, do you want to get the Wii or the PlayStation 3?

417
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:52,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Not sure why they didn't include the Xbox 360, but whatever, I guess maybe they figured that, you know, Xbox 360 is...

418
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:54,570
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.

419
00:27:19,352 --> 00:27:21,354
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not seeing that same correlation.

420
00:27:21,815 --> 00:27:25,698
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is it about Japan and their love for the PlayStation 3?

421
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:29,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the fact that Nintendo doesn't go to Tokyo Game Show?

422
00:27:29,442 --> 00:27:30,243
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll state the obvious there.

423
00:27:30,363 --> 00:27:39,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it maybe that people are just, you know, they're... Because the ooh and ahs of Sony being there, they're just loving that and that's kind of skewing their view a little bit, or what?

424
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:43,816
[SPEAKER_04]: I think my old theory stands is it has to do with getting...

425
00:27:45,006 --> 00:27:45,606
[SPEAKER_04]: a Blu-ray.

426
00:27:45,866 --> 00:27:50,027
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, honestly, I think that the Japanese market is looking at the whole Blu-ray thing as a positive.

427
00:27:50,047 --> 00:27:59,230
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, having a DVD player in it is what sold the PS2 because at the time it was a lot cheaper to get a PS2 than to go out and just buy a DVD player.

428
00:28:00,931 --> 00:28:03,431
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that they're looking for that multiple functionality.

429
00:28:03,451 --> 00:28:04,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

430
00:28:05,112 --> 00:28:05,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

431
00:28:10,343 --> 00:28:23,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Fireboma says Tokyo Game Show is mostly fanboys Nintendo wasn't at Tokyo Game Show so their fans weren't there Nintendo Maniac 64 says the poll was probably done that way probably because the 360 is already out

432
00:28:24,355 --> 00:28:27,397
[SPEAKER_02]: So, okay, that makes sense why they didn't include 360 in the poll.

433
00:28:27,818 --> 00:28:37,865
[SPEAKER_02]: But what about some of those, well, I don't know, I can't remember if we get into it later in the program, but I'll just quickly say, what about some of those 360 games that are being shown at Tokyo Game Show?

434
00:28:37,945 --> 00:28:41,668
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, do you think that this might sway the Japanese public at all?

435
00:28:41,708 --> 00:28:46,412
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I was watching the demo for Blue Dragon, some of the gameplay video, it looked pretty hot.

436
00:28:46,932 --> 00:28:49,975
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know, is it going to be enough, or is it too little too late?

437
00:28:51,176 --> 00:28:51,696
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we'll see.

438
00:28:51,716 --> 00:28:52,116
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

439
00:28:52,817 --> 00:28:53,077
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

440
00:28:55,808 --> 00:29:04,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, as far as the PS3 itself, you know, where they were going to have the price drop in Japan, we are not quite so lucky here.

441
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:12,107
[SPEAKER_04]: There's basically stating that there is no plans to drop the price in the United States.

442
00:29:12,607 --> 00:29:14,609
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still going to be $499 for the low end, $599 for the 60 gig version.

443
00:29:18,264 --> 00:29:24,090
[SPEAKER_04]: There hasn't been any set word if it's going to apply to Europe as well.

444
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:27,773
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're still set for a 2007 launch in March.

445
00:29:29,574 --> 00:29:30,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty interesting.

446
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:32,617
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of that might have to do with how it works here.

447
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:36,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think if we have a crappy launch here in the U.S.

448
00:29:36,481 --> 00:29:41,205
[SPEAKER_02]: that Europe might get the price drop as incentive for them to go buy them?

449
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:43,951
[SPEAKER_04]: It's possible, but that's not really how Sony plays.

450
00:29:44,172 --> 00:29:44,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.

451
00:29:45,274 --> 00:29:49,041
[SPEAKER_04]: One other thing, though, is that we are getting the HDMI slot on the low-end system.

452
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:50,941
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

453
00:30:12,739 --> 00:30:13,059
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.

454
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:42,422
[SPEAKER_03]: or maybe you do because it's actually a game that's already on the web for free.

455
00:30:43,262 --> 00:30:45,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of funny because they're trying to sell the game.

456
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:47,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to say that it's a bad game.

457
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:50,486
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually a pretty fun game and you can check it out online.

458
00:30:51,927 --> 00:30:53,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Just do a search for Flow.

459
00:30:53,288 --> 00:30:54,769
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pretty cool little thing.

460
00:30:54,789 --> 00:30:55,489
[SPEAKER_03]: They were talking about

461
00:30:56,249 --> 00:30:57,650
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually kind of an experiment.

462
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:03,574
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if I do a search for Flow, I might get a lot of websites that aren't related to gaming at all.

463
00:31:04,034 --> 00:31:07,256
[SPEAKER_02]: So perhaps you might want to specify that search a little more.

464
00:31:07,777 --> 00:31:08,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

465
00:31:08,457 --> 00:31:12,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you want to play Flow in the wonderful Flash version, you can do so.

466
00:31:13,641 --> 00:31:16,503
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a couple different places to check it out.

467
00:31:16,683 --> 00:31:17,664
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one's going to be...

468
00:31:19,256 --> 00:31:32,822
[SPEAKER_03]: at inti.usc.edu slash cloud slash flowing slash core.html.

469
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:34,863
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope you got a pen and paper for that one.

470
00:31:35,283 --> 00:31:37,084
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, rewind the show and write faster.

471
00:31:37,184 --> 00:31:37,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

472
00:31:38,744 --> 00:31:46,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, if you're looking for an easier way to actually play this, you can download copies, and I believe that there's one that's mirrored on PSP Updates.

473
00:31:47,677 --> 00:31:49,719
[SPEAKER_03]: or PS3 updates, I would imagine.

474
00:31:50,439 --> 00:32:02,930
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, so yeah, this game is going to be downloadable and supposedly you're going to have to purchase this, which is kind of funny because isn't this going to have a browser in it anyway?

475
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:06,292
[SPEAKER_03]: So couldn't you, I don't know, go browse over to this website and play it for free?

476
00:32:07,073 --> 00:32:11,717
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that seems kind of retarded to me that you would be able to, I don't know,

477
00:32:13,405 --> 00:32:16,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Download this for free instead of paying for Sony's service.

478
00:32:16,426 --> 00:32:21,448
[SPEAKER_02]: That kind of defeats the purpose of... Well, what about all those Geometry Wars clones when they were out there?

479
00:32:21,528 --> 00:32:25,890
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you could play it for free, quote-unquote, online or on the other platforms.

480
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but you can't play it for free on the PlayStation 3.

481
00:32:30,092 --> 00:32:34,834
[SPEAKER_03]: See, you can actually go with... Well, but you can't play Geometry Wars for free on the Xbox.

482
00:32:34,934 --> 00:32:36,134
[SPEAKER_03]: On the Xbox 360, that's what I'm saying.

483
00:32:36,314 --> 00:32:37,535
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can...

484
00:32:38,378 --> 00:32:50,043
[SPEAKER_03]: with the PlayStation 3, web browse over to this site and either download it to your hard drive and run it in Linux, or you could, I don't know, play it in the web browser, assuming that this thing supports Flash.

485
00:32:50,143 --> 00:32:55,845
[SPEAKER_03]: I would hope so, since it's a next-gen console with the fucking cell processor, it should be able to support Flash.

486
00:32:57,206 --> 00:32:58,486
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, you could play this game.

487
00:32:59,387 --> 00:33:02,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Ota G says, but, but, but, it's in HD!

488
00:33:03,268 --> 00:33:04,509
[SPEAKER_03]: But, but, but, who cares?

489
00:33:07,116 --> 00:33:10,639
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be in HD anyways, because it's going to be on your TV.

490
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,080
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

491
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,481
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think it's a waste of money.

492
00:33:14,082 --> 00:33:14,342
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

493
00:33:14,362 --> 00:33:21,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this was certainly a controversial story in the scene this week regarding the PlayStation 3, and it has to do with Gran Turismo HD.

494
00:33:22,779 --> 00:33:31,148
[SPEAKER_02]: And now there's these stories that have been going around about the fact that there's going to be this Gran Turismo HD Classic that's going to be, you know, kind of the entry into the GT series.

495
00:33:31,569 --> 00:33:38,176
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's going to be, I guess, 750 cars that you can download online for between 50 cents a dollar apiece.

496
00:33:38,256 --> 00:33:40,639
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically every... And there's 50 tracks between $1.50 and $4.50 apiece.

497
00:33:40,659 --> 00:33:41,200
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all the...

498
00:33:43,601 --> 00:33:47,862
[SPEAKER_03]: All the cars that have been basically created for the Gran Turismo series for the last 10 years.

499
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:51,543
[SPEAKER_02]: But Gran Turismo HD Premium will come with 2 courses and 30 cars.

500
00:33:52,103 --> 00:33:52,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

501
00:33:52,644 --> 00:33:58,985
[SPEAKER_03]: The Premium is going to be basically kind of a test model for Gran Turismo 5.

502
00:33:59,725 --> 00:34:02,946
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically really detailed looking cars.

503
00:34:03,206 --> 00:34:05,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Think like Forza or something like that.

504
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:07,832
[SPEAKER_03]: and just really nice stuff.

505
00:34:07,932 --> 00:34:14,116
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason why they don't have 750 cars in the premium version is because they haven't had a chance to create the models for all the cars yet.

506
00:34:14,456 --> 00:34:23,701
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really hurrying to get this game pushed out, which screams flaws up the ass.

507
00:34:24,301 --> 00:34:32,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, the classic version, I guess, is going to be an upscaled version of Gran Turismo 4 with all those wonderful cars to purchase.

508
00:34:33,615 --> 00:34:37,556
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're saying if I go to the store and buy this Gran Turismo Classic, I can't do anything with it?

509
00:34:37,616 --> 00:34:39,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Classic and Premium are in one game.

510
00:34:39,956 --> 00:34:40,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

511
00:34:40,756 --> 00:34:41,596
[SPEAKER_03]: It's different modes.

512
00:34:41,676 --> 00:34:42,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

513
00:34:43,017 --> 00:34:44,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I made it sound like it was two separate games.

514
00:34:45,057 --> 00:34:46,597
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's just one game.

515
00:34:46,677 --> 00:34:47,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, okay.

516
00:34:47,978 --> 00:34:57,599
[SPEAKER_03]: You will get some cars, but if you think about it, 30 cars and two tracks is a lot less than, say, 250 that I'm used to getting at the store for $49.99 for PlayStation 2.

517
00:34:57,639 --> 00:34:57,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh.

518
00:34:57,819 --> 00:34:58,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

519
00:34:58,239 --> 00:34:58,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

520
00:35:02,461 --> 00:35:05,183
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, what do you think about this microtransaction thing?

521
00:35:05,764 --> 00:35:06,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's the thing.

522
00:35:06,544 --> 00:35:08,666
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't stop at cars or tracks.

523
00:35:09,487 --> 00:35:13,189
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be adding parts and skins for your cars as well.

524
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:15,751
[SPEAKER_03]: They want it to become the iTunes of Gran Turismo.

525
00:35:16,052 --> 00:35:21,516
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going to be spending thousands of dollars, hopefully, on this crap for one game.

526
00:35:22,998 --> 00:35:38,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think about Test Drive Unlimited, which is something I've been playing a lot recently that also has a crap load of cars and a crap load of parts and things that you can get with it, but you unlock them naturally as you go to the in-game store.

527
00:35:38,182 --> 00:35:40,023
[SPEAKER_02]: None of this microtransaction crap.

528
00:35:40,063 --> 00:35:42,303
[SPEAKER_02]: You buy the game and all this stuff is included.

529
00:35:42,343 --> 00:35:45,144
[SPEAKER_02]: You unlock it within the game, and that's what we're all kind of used to.

530
00:35:45,364 --> 00:35:47,145
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's the other fun thing about this, too.

531
00:35:47,465 --> 00:35:48,385
[SPEAKER_03]: They were saying that...

532
00:35:50,123 --> 00:36:03,815
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the cars in this are going to be expensive because they want you to actually be, you know, just kind of having that, I guess, you know, other people have expensive cars.

533
00:36:03,835 --> 00:36:06,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, I've got to have that expensive car.

534
00:36:06,617 --> 00:36:08,659
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually going to be expensive.

535
00:36:09,139 --> 00:36:11,421
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I get to buy horse armor for said car?

536
00:36:12,482 --> 00:36:14,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if it were a horse, maybe.

537
00:36:14,584 --> 00:36:18,347
[SPEAKER_03]: But the whole thing screams to me as a bad idea.

538
00:36:18,917 --> 00:36:23,979
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of people, I mean, they may be fans of Gran Turismo, but who's really going to pay for all the cars?

539
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:28,981
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's just like saying, oh, here's Madden NFL.

540
00:36:29,241 --> 00:36:32,063
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, there's no teams or arenas included.

541
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:33,643
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to purchase those separately.

542
00:36:34,544 --> 00:36:36,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, by the way, the football's not included either.

543
00:36:37,045 --> 00:36:43,407
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like buying a car without tires or an engine or seats or a body.

544
00:36:43,587 --> 00:36:45,028
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's retarded.

545
00:36:45,608 --> 00:36:47,349
[SPEAKER_03]: So what exactly am I paying for here?

546
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,061
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerKalon's chat says, maybe you end up buying rims and spinners for the cars.

547
00:36:53,481 --> 00:36:55,862
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the other thing, too, about these cars.

548
00:36:56,762 --> 00:36:59,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Haz says, I want to buy a pine air freshener for my car.

549
00:37:00,523 --> 00:37:07,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Little fuzzy dice that can hang from the... I mean, why would you spend all this money on this?

550
00:37:07,805 --> 00:37:08,045
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

551
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:12,736
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't see people doing this.

552
00:37:12,756 --> 00:37:19,821
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because I know they're really trying to push this microtransaction thing, and if it goes well, you can better believe that Gran Turismo 5 is going to be the same thing.

553
00:37:20,181 --> 00:37:27,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a possibility here that this whole thing's being grossly misinterpreted or something's wrong here?

554
00:37:27,325 --> 00:37:30,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know on the internet this week, it was a little bit back and forth.

555
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:30,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Rumor, not rumor.

556
00:37:30,988 --> 00:37:37,552
[SPEAKER_03]: I've read a couple interviews, actually, with the head people for the lead on...

557
00:37:39,506 --> 00:37:41,108
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've confirmed this stuff.

558
00:37:41,188 --> 00:37:49,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the thing they haven't confirmed, they didn't say anything about the pricing on this and whether, you know, a lot of people aren't probably going to be buying 750 cars.

559
00:37:49,937 --> 00:37:50,478
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, you know, a fact.

560
00:37:52,864 --> 00:38:05,715
[SPEAKER_03]: But they didn't mention, you know, well, are there, you know, if I purchase, you know, say, a Honda Civic or something, and someone purchases a Lamborghini, I mean, am I going to have to purchase a, you know, more expensive car to be able to race against these people?

561
00:38:05,735 --> 00:38:09,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're going to be smoking me in this, you know, souped up car.

562
00:38:09,478 --> 00:38:19,527
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I think the whole thing's a bad idea, and I know there's been a lot of comparisons to Project Gotham Racing 3, but I kind of find it a little bit, you know,

563
00:38:20,037 --> 00:38:22,499
[SPEAKER_03]: That game does actually come with cars and tracks.

564
00:38:22,579 --> 00:38:27,381
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I think quite an unlimited amount of tracks since you can create your own courses in there.

565
00:38:27,862 --> 00:38:32,865
[SPEAKER_03]: But the fact is, I don't have to purchase these cars in order to be able to enjoy the game.

566
00:38:33,265 --> 00:38:39,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas if I want to play the online version of Classic, yes, you do have to purchase those cars, and yes, you do have to purchase those tracks.

567
00:38:39,889 --> 00:38:44,772
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's kind of retarded that I should have to spend money on a game that I already spent money on.

568
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:46,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

569
00:38:46,299 --> 00:38:47,540
[SPEAKER_02]: More interesting comments from chat.

570
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,381
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just lit up on this.

571
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:54,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Funnydale says, Sony is going to make players of Gran Turismo HD pay $5 a gallon for virtual gasoline.

572
00:38:55,185 --> 00:38:57,126
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 3, this is really living.

573
00:38:59,208 --> 00:38:59,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Funny.

574
00:39:00,168 --> 00:39:03,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Stickaxe, you know, a little bit of a counterpoint here.

575
00:39:03,711 --> 00:39:09,674
[SPEAKER_02]: If the game was cheap, and if I only like a few tracks, I don't have to spend $40 for a game I only want half of.

576
00:39:11,436 --> 00:39:11,696
[SPEAKER_03]: True.

577
00:39:11,976 --> 00:39:12,056
[SPEAKER_03]: And

578
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:21,133
[SPEAKER_03]: And the whole thing is, you know, the Gran Turismo HD Premium or whatever, it's just a fucking demo for Gran Turismo 5 is basically what it is.

579
00:39:21,793 --> 00:39:29,436
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, why should I pay for an upscaled version of 4, seeing as you can buy 4 and upscale it anyways, you know, ver-

580
00:39:30,303 --> 00:39:30,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Why the hell?

581
00:39:31,264 --> 00:39:35,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, first off, if I were ever to buy a PlayStation 3, I would never be buying this game at all.

582
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:37,747
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I would not touch this game with a 10-foot pole.

583
00:39:38,287 --> 00:39:41,209
[SPEAKER_03]: I would wait for a better racing game to come out, because you know what?

584
00:39:41,229 --> 00:39:43,010
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be a lot more out there.

585
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:49,353
[SPEAKER_01]: The only way I could ever see this selling is if it were like $10 for the core of it, and then everything else you can pay for.

586
00:39:49,933 --> 00:39:55,116
[SPEAKER_03]: If it were like, you know, you can buy 200 cars for $20 or something like that, then maybe, yeah.

587
00:39:55,552 --> 00:39:56,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Project Gotham 3 Car Packets

588
00:40:13,399 --> 00:40:14,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Project Gossam

589
00:40:37,672 --> 00:40:39,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Project Gotham 3 packs.

590
00:40:39,215 --> 00:40:42,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it because Project Gotham 3 actually is a full game without them?

591
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a full game.

592
00:40:43,781 --> 00:40:47,547
[SPEAKER_03]: You do not need to have these cars in order to enjoy the game.

593
00:40:48,648 --> 00:40:49,730
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of an added bonus.

594
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:52,594
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to buy the cars, then yeah, you can go ahead and do that.

595
00:40:53,177 --> 00:40:54,598
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

596
00:41:16,997 --> 00:41:20,439
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're going to leave with a couple chat comments here, and then we'll move on here.

597
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:22,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Gita in chat says, I don't really care.

598
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Waiting for Need for Speed Carbon.

599
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:27,361
[SPEAKER_02]: And NintendoManiac64 says, Excite Truck for the win.

600
00:41:28,142 --> 00:41:30,923
[SPEAKER_02]: So, sounds like some people are just going to take their money elsewhere.

601
00:41:31,003 --> 00:41:31,423
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

602
00:41:32,304 --> 00:41:32,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anyways.

603
00:41:35,065 --> 00:41:42,608
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually some interesting stuff coming out other than Gran Turismo HD, and that is our favorite game to talk about, Africa.

604
00:41:43,895 --> 00:41:45,757
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell is Africa?

605
00:41:46,157 --> 00:41:49,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's kind of funny because it's actually kind of what we thought it would be.

606
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:55,704
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically a virtual African safari where you can take pictures and basically keep them.

607
00:41:57,005 --> 00:41:58,666
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Pokemon Snap with giraffes.

608
00:41:59,026 --> 00:42:03,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, but it's not really a game though.

609
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:09,274
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically a virtual safari, virtual Africa where you get to see animals.

610
00:42:09,881 --> 00:42:13,085
[SPEAKER_03]: and basically experience Africa without going to Africa.

611
00:42:13,205 --> 00:42:15,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Did Elton John do the music and Tim Rice the lyrics?

612
00:42:16,289 --> 00:42:16,690
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

613
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:17,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't care.

614
00:42:17,311 --> 00:42:17,811
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

615
00:42:18,252 --> 00:42:20,435
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Jumbo Safari because you can harpoon animals.

616
00:42:21,377 --> 00:42:22,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Jumbo Safari Jumbo Safari

617
00:42:44,747 --> 00:42:47,969
[SPEAKER_03]: In studio, I have the trailer running right now for Africa.

618
00:42:48,329 --> 00:42:50,390
[SPEAKER_03]: And granted, it looks fucking amazing.

619
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:51,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's pretty.

620
00:42:51,851 --> 00:42:55,613
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very pretty, but the thing is, it's like, what the hell is this?

621
00:42:55,733 --> 00:42:57,874
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just, okay, it's Africa.

622
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,876
[SPEAKER_03]: There's grass.

623
00:43:01,056 --> 00:43:01,737
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Barons.

624
00:43:02,537 --> 00:43:03,838
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's birds and stuff.

625
00:43:04,118 --> 00:43:04,938
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Chuck Norris.

626
00:43:05,419 --> 00:43:07,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's the Barons without Chuck Norris jokes.

627
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,140
[SPEAKER_03]: What more do you need?

628
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,121
[SPEAKER_03]: So granted, okay, great.

629
00:43:10,201 --> 00:43:10,762
[SPEAKER_03]: It's elephants.

630
00:43:10,862 --> 00:43:12,843
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Discovery Channel, you know.

631
00:43:13,777 --> 00:43:17,380
[SPEAKER_03]: That's basically kind of what it seems to me to be, but I don't know.

632
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:21,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we really want, you know, do you really need to like buy this stuff?

633
00:43:22,563 --> 00:43:24,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the game I would recommend buying.

634
00:43:24,444 --> 00:43:26,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Cabela's African Safari.

635
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:29,388
[SPEAKER_03]: You get to go destroy, you know, elephants and rhinos and stuff.

636
00:43:29,408 --> 00:43:30,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you see like the predators eat other animals?

637
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:33,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they have cheetahs and stuff.

638
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:39,034
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see like the whole true circle of life where like they eat animals.

639
00:43:39,094 --> 00:43:39,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, hyenas.

640
00:43:40,575 --> 00:43:41,396
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Africa...

641
00:43:41,803 --> 00:43:43,484
[SPEAKER_03]: And look at their eating animals.

642
00:43:43,504 --> 00:43:46,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at the cute hyena eating the carcass.

643
00:43:47,747 --> 00:43:49,568
[SPEAKER_02]: And then suddenly out of nowhere, Crikey!

644
00:43:49,748 --> 00:43:51,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wait, bad taste, sorry, bad taste.

645
00:43:51,349 --> 00:43:52,470
[SPEAKER_02]: A stingray through my heart!

646
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:53,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad taste.

647
00:43:54,111 --> 00:43:55,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the hippo wiggling his little ears.

648
00:43:55,832 --> 00:43:56,952
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it looks great.

649
00:43:56,992 --> 00:43:58,854
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this looks really, really good.

650
00:43:58,974 --> 00:44:02,816
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, I think that, you know, they should do... Yeah, but maybe this is just the opening movie.

651
00:44:02,876 --> 00:44:04,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, how often do we get pissed off at that?

652
00:44:05,137 --> 00:44:09,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, you see the opening movie, and then, like, the game looks nothing like it.

653
00:44:09,482 --> 00:44:09,962
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

654
00:44:10,162 --> 00:44:13,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you mean like, kind of like, uh, oh, I don't know, Motorstorm?

655
00:44:14,864 --> 00:44:15,765
Ooh, pretty.

656
00:44:16,025 --> 00:44:23,568
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so granted, okay, this is, you know, really cool and stuff, but I don't know, I don't know if this- It does look amazing.

657
00:44:23,988 --> 00:44:26,349
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, graphically, it's, but yeah, what the hell is it?

658
00:44:26,369 --> 00:44:28,970
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I don't need tech demos as a fucking game.

659
00:44:30,911 --> 00:44:32,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're the same- Wait a minute.

660
00:44:32,191 --> 00:44:33,672
[SPEAKER_04]: They cut it off before he ate the gazelle.

661
00:44:33,872 --> 00:44:37,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Aren't you the same person that said you were wanting to get a copy of Wii Play from Japan?

662
00:44:37,493 --> 00:44:38,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because that's fun.

663
00:44:38,154 --> 00:44:39,294
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want tech demos as a game.

664
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:45,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, tech demos as in like, okay, here's ducks, okay, and look at the ducks.

665
00:44:46,978 --> 00:44:48,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, Jeremy Todd 1 is great.

666
00:44:48,799 --> 00:44:49,259
[SPEAKER_03]: What'd he say?

667
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:54,122
[SPEAKER_04]: In Africa, you will be able to hunt down your favorite species of rare animals and take pictures of them.

668
00:44:54,522 --> 00:44:59,845
[SPEAKER_04]: On rare nights, usually nights with a full moon, you will be able to see Chuck Norris running around killing elephants with his bare hands.

669
00:45:00,245 --> 00:45:01,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Take a picture for massive damage.

670
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:05,108
[SPEAKER_04]: That was beautiful.

671
00:45:05,548 --> 00:45:06,068
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

672
00:45:06,088 --> 00:45:07,329
[SPEAKER_04]: You win the chatroom cookie.

673
00:45:08,209 --> 00:45:09,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like I said, you know,

674
00:45:12,693 --> 00:45:13,554
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a nice game.

675
00:45:14,434 --> 00:45:18,016
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that there's more to it than just look at the pretty animals.

676
00:45:18,336 --> 00:45:20,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know.

677
00:45:20,317 --> 00:45:23,259
[SPEAKER_04]: I sort of think that I would play that.

678
00:45:23,459 --> 00:45:27,160
[SPEAKER_04]: But then again, I also did play a whole bunch of Pokemon Snap.

679
00:45:27,701 --> 00:45:33,043
[SPEAKER_04]: But something that I will play, because I'm probably going to get a PS3, is Ninja Gaiden.

680
00:45:33,324 --> 00:45:34,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Ninja Gaiden.

681
00:45:35,137 --> 00:45:45,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming out on PS3, according to Famitsu, there is going to be one called Ninja Gaiden Sigma, which you will play as Rachel from Ninja Gaiden Black.

682
00:45:48,463 --> 00:45:55,486
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was actually also revealed that Itagaki was saying that there was going to be a Ninja Gaiden 2 version,

683
00:45:56,461 --> 00:45:59,364
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't stating that it was the same project.

684
00:46:00,765 --> 00:46:06,549
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also a theory that this is going to be a remake of Ninja Gaiden Black with extras.

685
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:14,116
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's also been no statement on if it's going to be specific just to the PS3 or if it will see multiple systems.

686
00:46:14,196 --> 00:46:15,437
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it'll see multiple systems.

687
00:46:17,418 --> 00:46:17,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably.

688
00:46:17,979 --> 00:46:25,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know Ninja Gaiden Black did really well on the Xbox, so I wouldn't see why they wouldn't try to make a 360 version

689
00:46:26,089 --> 00:46:28,611
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

690
00:46:52,788 --> 00:46:57,172
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the demo thing because they did it during E3 and got some pretty good demos from that.

691
00:46:57,252 --> 00:47:00,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully you're going to see some more stuff as far as demos go.

692
00:47:00,434 --> 00:47:05,298
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that their Sonic the Hedgehog is supposed to be next week at some point so that would be cool.

693
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:10,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe even some more Japanese exclusive demos would be nice because I get to play those anyways.

694
00:47:12,104 --> 00:47:13,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Just stuff like that.

695
00:47:15,126 --> 00:47:19,550
[SPEAKER_03]: I like how they're doing this and hopefully we'll see some more stuff that come out pretty soon.

696
00:47:20,731 --> 00:47:31,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, as far as things that are coming out relatively soon, at the Tokyo Game Show, Microsoft had a press release stating what new live arcade games were going to be coming out.

697
00:47:32,097 --> 00:47:39,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Included were Contra, Gyruss, Dig Dug, Track and Field, New Rally X, Russian Attack, Ms.

698
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:43,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Pac-Man, and exclusive for the Japanese audience, Yaya Kung Fu.

699
00:47:45,324 --> 00:47:45,804
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.

700
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:49,932
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if I can play that since I have my Japanese account, you know.

701
00:47:50,232 --> 00:47:50,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't bother.

702
00:47:51,352 --> 00:47:52,372
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like Yarkung Fu.

703
00:47:52,412 --> 00:47:54,453
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of people have a lot of love for that game.

704
00:47:54,673 --> 00:47:58,293
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's this amazing fighting game people make it out to be.

705
00:47:59,294 --> 00:48:01,494
[SPEAKER_04]: It's what practically started the genre.

706
00:48:03,094 --> 00:48:03,595
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll try it.

707
00:48:03,955 --> 00:48:04,275
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

708
00:48:04,495 --> 00:48:05,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Not my favorite.

709
00:48:05,135 --> 00:48:09,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, they do have the free demo versions you can try out.

710
00:48:10,196 --> 00:48:12,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Gyrus, on the other hand, bring it.

711
00:48:12,696 --> 00:48:13,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Freaking love Gyrus.

712
00:48:13,717 --> 00:48:15,557
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so there when Gyrus comes out.

713
00:48:16,499 --> 00:48:22,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Now some interesting things were found out actually this week, or at least have been brought to light.

714
00:48:23,303 --> 00:48:31,789
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that you can download or copy your Xbox Live arcade games onto a CD-R or DVD-R and be able to play them on your system.

715
00:48:32,229 --> 00:48:33,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Now why is this important?

716
00:48:33,269 --> 00:48:37,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not everyone out there has a hard drive for their system, as much as I'd like to think so.

717
00:48:38,656 --> 00:48:42,018
[SPEAKER_03]: and also that the memory units are quite limited on what you can put on there.

718
00:48:42,358 --> 00:48:48,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Now there's a big huge kind of how-to on 360gamesaves.com if you want to know how to do this.

719
00:48:48,983 --> 00:48:57,090
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's kind of funny, this is one of the things that they actually have been able to do is pull off the full version of Hexic HD.

720
00:48:57,150 --> 00:49:00,252
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you don't have a hard drive, you can actually play it on your system.

721
00:49:00,792 --> 00:49:06,517
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's basically as simple as bringing them into a certain directory structure on your PC

722
00:49:08,187 --> 00:49:14,912
[SPEAKER_03]: and basically popping it in and they will populate your Xbox Live Arcade list there, which is pretty cool.

723
00:49:15,292 --> 00:49:20,356
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you do have them registered on your system, they will be the full version, otherwise they are a demo.

724
00:49:22,717 --> 00:49:24,399
[SPEAKER_02]: So when might somebody want to actually use this?

725
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:34,126
[SPEAKER_03]: If they don't have a hard drive or if they're just stuck to just a simple memory unit, they might, I don't know, if they have the extra...

726
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:35,521
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.com

727
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:59,802
[SPEAKER_03]: does the kind of not legit thing and takes all the demos and puts them on a disk image and, you know, distributes that over the internet, which would be cool.

728
00:50:00,082 --> 00:50:15,646
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that should be something that Microsoft should do anyways, because I know that, well, I know they were trying to push their Xbox Live Arcade Unplugged, but, you know, this way, if you could download all the demos, say, to a disk image, kind of like how they have the backwards compatibility updates, that would be pretty cool as well.

729
00:50:15,666 --> 00:50:20,967
[SPEAKER_03]: And you just burn it onto the disk and then pop it in there and you have all the demos for all the games and then you can just, you know,

730
00:50:21,789 --> 00:50:23,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Register them, I guess, somehow.

731
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:26,032
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of a problem if you don't have live, I guess.

732
00:50:27,312 --> 00:50:28,873
[SPEAKER_03]: And how is piracy going to be prevented again?

733
00:50:30,074 --> 00:50:38,679
[SPEAKER_03]: The way piracy is prevented on it is actually that you're not going to be able to... The games are only demo versions unless it's registered to your account.

734
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:39,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

735
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:46,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, because sometimes I start up Geometry Wars and it looks like it's a demo and then suddenly it switches over and it says, oh, never mind, it's a demo version.

736
00:50:46,444 --> 00:50:49,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because whether they're registered or not is based on your account.

737
00:50:49,966 --> 00:50:51,547
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't just download a registered version.

738
00:50:53,208 --> 00:50:57,189
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, speaking of the 360, we have a very exciting announcement for the 360.

739
00:50:57,789 --> 00:51:02,030
[SPEAKER_02]: At least I know a lot of our import game fans are going to love this because these were huge games.

740
00:51:02,050 --> 00:51:05,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they were released here too, but it seems to appeal to that same audience.

741
00:51:05,951 --> 00:51:08,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Radiant Silvergun and Ikaruga.

742
00:51:08,811 --> 00:51:10,732
[SPEAKER_02]: You might recognize these two shooter titles.

743
00:51:11,112 --> 00:51:15,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, did you know that this was always planned to be a trilogy?

744
00:51:17,013 --> 00:51:17,853
[SPEAKER_02]: And guess what?

745
00:51:17,913 --> 00:51:18,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Treasure...

746
00:51:19,348 --> 00:51:24,670
[SPEAKER_02]: has announced that they will be making a third game in the series for the Xbox 360.

747
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:25,910
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all we know.

748
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:26,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Treasure loves us.

749
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:27,610
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all we know.

750
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:31,111
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know when, where, how, what.

751
00:51:31,351 --> 00:51:34,192
[SPEAKER_02]: We just know that Treasure's making it, and it's coming to the 360.

752
00:51:34,912 --> 00:51:37,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I love Radiant Silvergun so much.

753
00:51:37,513 --> 00:51:39,213
[SPEAKER_02]: So now will you play your 360, Jamie?

754
00:51:39,594 --> 00:51:40,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes!

755
00:51:40,354 --> 00:51:41,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god!

756
00:51:42,236 --> 00:51:47,540
[SPEAKER_04]: I played the hell out of Radiant Silvergun at that one arcade in Las Vegas before they shut down.

757
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:49,581
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, Radiant Silvergun?

758
00:51:49,841 --> 00:51:51,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone else is off playing Mambo at GoGo.

759
00:51:51,783 --> 00:51:52,803
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, screw that.

760
00:51:53,764 --> 00:51:54,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Radiant Silvergun?

761
00:51:54,725 --> 00:51:55,665
[SPEAKER_04]: They couldn't get me off the machine.

762
00:51:55,946 --> 00:52:05,632
[SPEAKER_02]: What's interesting about that, I think, is that those games are usually very vertical in nature, yet now the Xbox 360 supports widescreen and all their games have to support widescreen.

763
00:52:06,013 --> 00:52:10,636
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to be interesting what all that new horizontalness does to the game, don't you think?

764
00:52:11,258 --> 00:52:15,101
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually am sort of foreseeing something like, what was it, Thunder Force 5?

765
00:52:15,441 --> 00:52:20,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't that one have a lot of the rotational, where it would go one way and then rotate the other way?

766
00:52:21,185 --> 00:52:23,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it wasn't Thunder Force 5, maybe I'm thinking of Einhander.

767
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:28,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Einhander did a lot of vertical and horizontal scrolling in their games.

768
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:29,631
[SPEAKER_03]: And Salamander.

769
00:52:29,831 --> 00:52:31,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Salamander actually did both, too.

770
00:52:31,652 --> 00:52:32,973
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to make a new Einhander.

771
00:52:33,434 --> 00:52:34,014
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about time.

772
00:52:34,174 --> 00:52:35,435
[SPEAKER_04]: If they do it, it'd be Zweihander.

773
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

774
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:37,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

775
00:52:37,917 --> 00:52:38,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

776
00:52:39,258 --> 00:52:41,280
[SPEAKER_04]: So, how about some release dates, y'all?

777
00:52:41,801 --> 00:52:46,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, of course, we will start off with our UK release dates.

778
00:52:46,826 --> 00:52:48,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Some okay stuff, I guess.

779
00:52:49,548 --> 00:52:56,996
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it would help if my laptop wouldn't come unplugged when I'm trying to pull up the dates.

780
00:52:57,998 --> 00:53:00,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry guys, I just got a little bit of a hang up.

781
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:02,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the internet's acting funny tonight.

782
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Our chat room's all crazy tonight.

783
00:53:04,201 --> 00:53:05,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Live radio, folks.

784
00:53:05,842 --> 00:53:07,643
[SPEAKER_04]: The internet's not acting funny for me.

785
00:53:08,323 --> 00:53:11,545
[SPEAKER_04]: The fact that my computer came unplugged and my battery was going WTF.

786
00:53:12,725 --> 00:53:15,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so how about our UK release dates?

787
00:53:15,767 --> 00:53:16,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Take two.

788
00:53:17,407 --> 00:53:25,411
[SPEAKER_04]: On the 25th, which it probably already is in the UK, Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2 March of the Minis coming out.

789
00:53:25,651 --> 00:53:25,892
[SPEAKER_04]: On the 29th,

790
00:53:28,499 --> 00:53:55,064
[SPEAKER_04]: 42 all-time classics coming out on the DS, Age of Empires, Age of Kings, Black Buccaneer on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation 2, Company of Heroes on PC, Devil May Cry 3, Dante's Awakening, Special Edition, that's a cool game, guys, get it, Infrared, and Kingdom Hearts 2 coming out on PlayStation 2, Mercury Meltdown also on the 30th, Mad Tracks coming out on Xbox 360.

791
00:53:56,244 --> 00:53:56,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.

792
00:53:57,473 --> 00:53:59,154
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some pretty cool stuff coming out.

793
00:53:59,534 --> 00:54:01,895
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope Bad Trax is coming out, because that'd be pretty awesome.

794
00:54:01,935 --> 00:54:03,316
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to play that.

795
00:54:04,717 --> 00:54:15,562
[SPEAKER_03]: For, of course, I've got to mention this first, the big game for the PlayStation 2 this week, Dance Dance Revolution Supernova, of course, will be coming out.

796
00:54:16,562 --> 00:54:18,944
[SPEAKER_03]: I have heard, though, that the bundle might be delayed.

797
00:54:19,044 --> 00:54:24,186
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you don't have a dance pad yet, which I don't see why you wouldn't, you might be waiting a little bit.

798
00:54:25,547 --> 00:54:25,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course,

799
00:54:26,773 --> 00:54:34,115
[SPEAKER_03]: On the PlayStation 2, we also have, or actually PlayStation 2, Xbox, the 360, and PSP, NBA Live 07.

800
00:54:34,455 --> 00:54:39,517
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if you're not a fan of Live, NBA 2K7 is coming out on PlayStation 2, Xbox, and the 360.

801
00:54:39,937 --> 00:54:45,779
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're not a fan of basketball, maybe you're a fan of racing games, in which case you've got a couple things.

802
00:54:45,879 --> 00:54:50,580
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one's going to be the Fast and the Furious on PlayStation 2, loosely based on Tokyo Drift.

803
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:55,582
[SPEAKER_03]: And Import Tuner Challenge on the Xbox 360.

804
00:54:57,661 --> 00:55:00,883
[SPEAKER_03]: which there was a rumor that that was going to be $29.99 at Best Buy.

805
00:55:01,503 --> 00:55:03,365
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a typo.

806
00:55:04,125 --> 00:55:12,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, of course, Just Cause will be coming out on Xbox 360, the Xbox and PlayStation 2, as well as the PC.

807
00:55:13,991 --> 00:55:15,272
[SPEAKER_03]: And some other fun stuff.

808
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:24,217
[SPEAKER_03]: On the GameCube, Beiten and Kato's Origins will be coming out, one of the last role-playing games actually made by Nintendo for the GameCube, so check that out.

809
00:55:24,757 --> 00:55:25,418
[SPEAKER_03]: As well as...

810
00:55:26,502 --> 00:55:33,927
[SPEAKER_03]: The Game Boy Advance will be getting some re-releases, including Pokemon FireRed as part of the greatest hits, and LeafGreen.

811
00:55:35,468 --> 00:55:40,211
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, there's some pretty good stuff coming out.

812
00:55:41,612 --> 00:55:46,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Ford Boldmoves Street Racing, if you're a racing fan on the PlayStation 2, kind of a budget game.

813
00:55:46,796 --> 00:55:52,519
[SPEAKER_03]: And Greg Hastings Tournament Paintball Max, which the game is about a year old now, but still, you might want to play it.

814
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,641
[SPEAKER_03]: And Valkyrie Profile 2, Symera.

815
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:56,200
[SPEAKER_03]: on the PlayStation 2.

816
00:56:23,331 --> 00:56:25,375
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think that's funny, a game about an MMO

817
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:34,741
[SPEAKER_03]: and the game Live Radio Kids.

818
00:56:57,311 --> 00:57:02,153
[SPEAKER_03]: as well as a generic fishing game on July 18th of 07.

819
00:57:02,533 --> 00:57:19,720
[SPEAKER_03]: GISH for the PSP is coming out February 28th of 07, as well as a Guilty Gear title for the PlayStation 2, entitled right now Guilty Gear Series, but I guess that's a working title for that, and that's coming out January 2nd, so look for those.

820
00:57:20,281 --> 00:57:24,442
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are in the market for some Xbox 360 games, there's been a few price drops.

821
00:57:25,343 --> 00:57:25,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick 4...

822
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:27,611
[SPEAKER_03]: X-Men The Official Game of the Movie

823
00:57:50,427 --> 00:57:51,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Melgear Solid Portable Ops.

824
00:57:52,008 --> 00:57:57,391
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the cool things though that we probably won't ever see over here is going to be a Portable Ops bundle for the PSP.

825
00:57:58,131 --> 00:58:06,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're really trying to sell the PSP since they're getting their asses handed to them by Nintendo with the DS.

826
00:58:07,096 --> 00:58:19,243
[SPEAKER_03]: The wonderful little bundle is going to include a snakeskin patterned case as well as the game and a fun little box that comes

827
00:58:19,659 --> 00:58:20,239
[SPEAKER_03]: with everything.

828
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:25,981
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you haven't gotten a PSP already and you're thinking about doing so, definitely check it out.

829
00:58:26,441 --> 00:58:29,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Comes with a box of cigarettes and Snake's favorite brand?

830
00:58:29,522 --> 00:58:29,662
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

831
00:58:29,863 --> 00:58:30,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

832
00:58:30,343 --> 00:58:38,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually, it does come with an additional pouch with the, looks like the logo for the game on it as well.

833
00:58:38,445 --> 00:58:46,188
[SPEAKER_03]: But other than that, no real additional bonuses to it other than kind of a cool-looking PSP box.

834
00:58:46,568 --> 00:58:48,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Airsoft sniper rifle, you know.

835
00:58:49,944 --> 00:58:58,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, well, speaking of very cool things, Guitar Hero is going to be making it to multiple formats in 2007.

836
00:58:58,806 --> 00:59:04,427
[SPEAKER_04]: So that means that y'all who missed out are going to be having your second chance.

837
00:59:05,487 --> 00:59:16,729
[SPEAKER_04]: It has been announced by the chairman of Activision that, and this is a quote, that it will appear on every significant new format.

838
00:59:18,045 --> 00:59:26,274
[SPEAKER_04]: while also going into some of the information about their general plan from what it looks like as far as some of their other titles.

839
00:59:29,057 --> 00:59:36,746
[SPEAKER_04]: There hasn't been an official comment by Red Octane, but they did say 2007, and also Guitar Hero 2 is supposed to be out in November.

840
00:59:37,611 --> 00:59:39,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't that seem like a vague statement, though?

841
00:59:39,833 --> 00:59:41,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Every significant new platform?

842
00:59:41,934 --> 00:59:44,276
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean... Well, what's their idea of significant?

843
00:59:44,336 --> 00:59:44,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

844
00:59:45,557 --> 00:59:47,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they like the Wonderswan.

845
00:59:47,699 --> 00:59:50,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, maybe they just mean it ain't coming for the Phantom.

846
00:59:50,421 --> 00:59:50,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

847
00:59:50,781 --> 00:59:55,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Do not say hoo-hoo about the Wonderswan because it had the best home version of Beatmania.

848
00:59:56,186 --> 00:59:57,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the best portable version of Beatmania.

849
00:59:58,708 --> 01:00:01,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this too much Guitar Hero?

850
01:00:03,291 --> 01:00:04,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this going to be an oversaturation of the market?

851
01:00:05,533 --> 01:00:05,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah.

852
01:00:05,853 --> 01:00:06,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah?

853
01:00:07,301 --> 01:00:07,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

854
01:00:08,222 --> 01:00:08,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes?

855
01:00:08,762 --> 01:00:10,163
[SPEAKER_03]: I just thought I'd say that.

856
01:00:11,064 --> 01:00:24,215
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so, because, I mean, really, it's gonna... I think Guitar Hero's gonna go the same path as Guitar Freaks, where, I mean, even though they still make tons of games for that, it's just, what are you gonna have?

857
01:00:24,275 --> 01:00:30,580
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not really gonna be able to innovate on the gameplay any, so it's just gonna be brand new music each time around.

858
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:33,163
[SPEAKER_03]: And, I mean, well, I guess DDR... I mean, DDR does...

859
01:00:34,144 --> 01:00:34,765
[SPEAKER_03]: SoCalibur 2

860
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:03,602
[SPEAKER_04]: is, you know, where Soul Calibur 2 had different special characters on each game.

861
01:01:04,022 --> 01:01:08,143
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a certain packet of songs on each game that's exclusive to just that one.

862
01:01:08,203 --> 01:01:08,703
[SPEAKER_02]: God, no.

863
01:01:08,743 --> 01:01:09,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'd have to buy them all.

864
01:01:11,544 --> 01:01:12,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do that.

865
01:01:13,244 --> 01:01:14,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but wouldn't that sell more games?

866
01:01:15,625 --> 01:01:15,965
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

867
01:01:15,985 --> 01:01:19,706
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, you know, really... I did own every version of Soul Calibur 2.

868
01:01:20,186 --> 01:01:26,487
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see how well 2 does, because, I mean, 2... People are going to be having, you know, the buy 2, and they're going to be like,

869
01:01:28,223 --> 01:01:30,825
[SPEAKER_03]: They might just go, okay, I've seen this before.

870
01:01:31,545 --> 01:01:31,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

871
01:01:32,325 --> 01:01:32,765
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

872
01:01:32,825 --> 01:01:35,307
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's got a huge enough fan base the game's going to do very well.

873
01:01:35,647 --> 01:01:37,908
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the game's going to do very, very well this Christmas.

874
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:39,549
[SPEAKER_02]: What do I know?

875
01:01:40,509 --> 01:01:46,592
[SPEAKER_02]: I do know that an interesting story that somewhat relates to this is that a very interesting purchase has been made.

876
01:01:47,552 --> 01:01:51,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, a while ago it kind of turned heads when Activision acquired Red Octane.

877
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:53,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now the other...

878
01:01:54,088 --> 01:01:55,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Harmonix, MTV Networks

879
01:02:04,392 --> 01:02:05,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.

880
01:02:05,453 --> 01:02:14,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, earlier this week, MTV announced a definitive agreement to acquire Harmonix Music Systems, developer of Guitar Hero, on behalf of MTV.

881
01:02:14,999 --> 01:02:20,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Under the terms of the transaction, MTV acquires all of the outstanding stock of Harmonix for $175 million in cash.

882
01:02:21,384 --> 01:02:29,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Harmonix shareholders may be eligible for incremental earn-out payments through 2008 to the extent that financial results exceed specific targets.

883
01:02:30,029 --> 01:02:33,652
[SPEAKER_02]: This is to demonstrate MTV's commitment to music and

884
01:02:34,178 --> 01:02:36,419
[SPEAKER_02]: You can play videos if you want to demonstrate that.

885
01:02:36,899 --> 01:02:43,722
[SPEAKER_02]: And furthers its strategy of engaging passionate music fans through a deep and immersive multi-platform entertainment experience.

886
01:02:44,122 --> 01:02:45,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Summary, we're screwed.

887
01:02:46,963 --> 01:02:52,345
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, this means that MTV Games' logo will soon show up on Guitar Hero.

888
01:02:52,365 --> 01:02:53,065
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be interesting.

889
01:02:54,466 --> 01:02:57,187
[SPEAKER_02]: But could it allow them to get better licenses for the game?

890
01:02:58,732 --> 01:03:03,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Possibly, but I can't really see the game getting much better if MTV's label is slapped on it.

891
01:03:03,695 --> 01:03:05,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Could they finally get Metallica?

892
01:03:07,758 --> 01:03:08,239
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

893
01:03:08,599 --> 01:03:11,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Metallica can be kind of, you know, pissy when it comes to their music.

894
01:03:11,781 --> 01:03:13,582
[SPEAKER_02]: They're totally... They're a little bit anal about their life.

895
01:03:13,602 --> 01:03:15,063
[SPEAKER_04]: However, they are now on iTunes.

896
01:03:15,143 --> 01:03:16,704
[SPEAKER_02]: They are the divas of rock.

897
01:03:17,605 --> 01:03:18,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

898
01:03:19,346 --> 01:03:19,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

899
01:03:22,248 --> 01:03:23,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, um...

900
01:03:24,116 --> 01:03:24,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Elton John, Rocketman

901
01:03:50,612 --> 01:03:55,376
[SPEAKER_03]: for all those who want to do a wonderful impression of William Shatner.

902
01:03:56,337 --> 01:04:01,381
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, Summertime, which I think is pretty cool.

903
01:04:02,462 --> 01:04:03,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Blur Song 2.

904
01:04:03,223 --> 01:04:04,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, Blur.

905
01:04:06,125 --> 01:04:07,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see here, some other good songs.

906
01:04:07,306 --> 01:04:10,209
[SPEAKER_04]: The resident Damon Auburn fangirl is going, whoo.

907
01:04:10,589 --> 01:04:12,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Scissor Sisters, Take Your Mama.

908
01:04:12,611 --> 01:04:13,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, Scissor Sisters.

909
01:04:14,973 --> 01:04:16,354
[SPEAKER_03]: The Police, Every Breath You Take.

910
01:04:16,574 --> 01:04:17,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Stalker Song.

911
01:04:18,212 --> 01:04:23,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Leonard Skinner, Sweet Home Alabama Good Charlotte, Girls and Boys Ace of Spades, Me and Some Guy

912
01:04:34,105 --> 01:04:35,746
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all giddy after freaking walking out to Motorhead at E3.

913
01:04:35,766 --> 01:04:37,968
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 15 minutes, I won't get back.

914
01:05:03,242 --> 01:05:04,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, DMN, shut up!

915
01:05:04,603 --> 01:05:05,584
[SPEAKER_04]: No, ooh, Alabama.

916
01:05:05,704 --> 01:05:06,705
[SPEAKER_04]: It's ooh, Alabama.

917
01:05:06,865 --> 01:05:07,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Alabama rocks.

918
01:05:08,427 --> 01:05:11,230
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to really ask those people at the IA Judgment booth.

919
01:05:11,890 --> 01:05:12,771
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell is this for?

920
01:05:12,811 --> 01:05:16,194
[SPEAKER_02]: You tried to, and they totally were ignoring you at one point.

921
01:05:16,215 --> 01:05:19,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you were totally like, what the hell is this thing?

922
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:22,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, good times.

923
01:05:22,561 --> 01:05:23,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Too bad there won't be an E3 next year.

924
01:05:24,401 --> 01:05:26,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, or, I'm sorry, in its current form.

925
01:05:26,642 --> 01:05:31,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, uh, chatroom's yelling and bitching, I need to make this correction, the MTV logo already appears on Guitar Hero 1.

926
01:05:32,245 --> 01:05:46,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I haven't, the last time I played Guitar Hero 1 was at E3, cause it was one of the games they had at Arena, and you know, it seems like every time you go into Arena, somebody's playing Guitar Hero, so, that's the last time I played it, and I didn't get to see the boot-up sequence at that time.

927
01:05:46,758 --> 01:05:51,762
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe the signs of this acquisition were a long time coming then, you could infer from that.

928
01:05:51,822 --> 01:05:53,543
[SPEAKER_02]: So sorry for my oversight.

929
01:05:53,583 --> 01:05:54,444
[SPEAKER_02]: You can flog me later.

930
01:05:54,524 --> 01:05:58,407
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure that the MTV logo being on the game is only going to make the game better.

931
01:06:01,610 --> 01:06:02,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, MTV!

932
01:06:03,031 --> 01:06:04,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Instantly my brain has turned to jello!

933
01:06:04,972 --> 01:06:06,814
[SPEAKER_03]: If anything, all it will do is help...

934
01:06:07,447 --> 01:06:08,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Help promote the game.

935
01:06:08,448 --> 01:06:09,349
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about it.

936
01:06:09,389 --> 01:06:16,796
[SPEAKER_03]: They will be able to promote it more on their shows and do their own Guitar Hero, be a Guitar Hero TV contest thing or whatever.

937
01:06:16,816 --> 01:06:17,116
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

938
01:06:17,496 --> 01:06:20,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Having the MTV logo on Guitar Hero makes it lose instant cool points.

939
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:23,902
[SPEAKER_01]: Repeat what you said, Drew, not because you didn't have a mic.

940
01:06:24,122 --> 01:06:27,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, ooh, we might just be playing the Jackass theme on Guitar Hero.

941
01:06:27,585 --> 01:06:31,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, yeah, they'll combine some of their franchises here, you know, on

942
01:06:32,267 --> 01:06:32,847
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that show?

943
01:06:32,887 --> 01:06:37,528
[SPEAKER_02]: My Sweet Sixteen, Guitar Hero, whatever that fucking show is with the spoiled brats.

944
01:06:38,329 --> 01:06:39,609
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess he doesn't watch TV.

945
01:06:40,069 --> 01:06:40,749
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

946
01:06:41,069 --> 01:06:50,212
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't watch it very much either, but it's kind of one of those things when your roommate's watching Next, you can't help but kind of look and go, God damn, I weep for the youth of America.

947
01:06:51,012 --> 01:06:51,492
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay.

948
01:06:51,532 --> 01:06:52,012
[SPEAKER_01]: What's next?

949
01:06:52,032 --> 01:06:53,753
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we going to see Beavis and Butthead in the crowd?

950
01:06:54,898 --> 01:06:55,879
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be okay.

951
01:06:55,959 --> 01:06:56,679
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be cool.

952
01:06:56,759 --> 01:06:57,320
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be cool.

953
01:06:57,700 --> 01:06:58,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I like Beavis and Bowhead.

954
01:06:58,880 --> 01:06:59,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, that would be cool.

955
01:07:00,281 --> 01:07:03,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, like, have, like, some sort of, like, New Age thing.

956
01:07:03,623 --> 01:07:04,324
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not New Age.

957
01:07:04,344 --> 01:07:06,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, New Wave and then have, like, Daria hanging out on the side.

958
01:07:07,245 --> 01:07:08,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Nine Inch Nails concert.

959
01:07:08,466 --> 01:07:16,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Geeta in our chatroom says, This is the true story of seven gamers picked to play a game and have their lives taped.

960
01:07:18,172 --> 01:07:19,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Pull the gun trigger now.

961
01:07:20,073 --> 01:07:21,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Point it at my head and pull the trigger.

962
01:07:23,062 --> 01:07:24,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to other music game news.

963
01:07:24,502 --> 01:07:27,443
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a little bit exciting, but yet at the same time disappointing.

964
01:07:27,743 --> 01:07:32,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Word is coming via joystick from their hands-on of Parappa the Rapper on the PSP.

965
01:07:33,904 --> 01:07:45,727
[SPEAKER_02]: The PSP demo for Parappa the Rapper, which we reported last week is coming to the PSP, it's the exact same demo that the PS1 Parappa the Rapper used, which makes us think Parappa the Rapper on PSP is just going to be

966
01:07:46,258 --> 01:07:46,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in touch!

967
01:08:00,131 --> 01:08:02,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, there is some silver lining to this.

968
01:08:02,293 --> 01:08:03,634
[SPEAKER_02]: The graphics have been cleaned up.

969
01:08:03,934 --> 01:08:05,916
[SPEAKER_02]: The audio is a little bit crisper.

970
01:08:06,856 --> 01:08:11,020
[SPEAKER_02]: The rapping guy, you know, Parappa, of course, still stutters, you know, when you don't hit the buttons right.

971
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:12,601
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that's kind of what they're supposed to do.

972
01:08:13,081 --> 01:08:19,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, supposedly, though, there is going to be a multiplayer mode, which could, you know, make this game the must-own.

973
01:08:19,527 --> 01:08:19,887
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

974
01:08:20,527 --> 01:08:24,250
[SPEAKER_02]: But it should also be pointed out that there's cute little Parappa stickers for the PSP.

975
01:08:24,330 --> 01:08:26,492
[SPEAKER_02]: And I look at that and I go, I want one right now.

976
01:08:27,093 --> 01:08:27,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now.

977
01:08:28,214 --> 01:08:28,754
[SPEAKER_02]: That's hot.

978
01:08:29,948 --> 01:08:51,916
[SPEAKER_02]: consumer whore and Hal alright we're going to bring this part A to a close here but first we've got DDR sneak peeks for you guys that's right here on Orange Lounge Radio we've been previewing new DDR games that are coming out very soon Ultramix 4 a little later this year as well as DDR Universe sometime this winter at some point

979
01:08:52,771 --> 01:08:53,672
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

980
01:11:39,474 --> 01:11:40,221
Thanks for watching!

981
01:12:14,226 --> 01:12:15,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

982
01:12:33,086 --> 01:12:39,048
[SPEAKER_02]: from DDR Ultra Mix 4, that is Rupesh Kartel with Yours to Command here on Orange Lounge Radio, the DDR Sneak Peeks.

983
01:12:40,068 --> 01:12:41,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of 80s reminiscent, that song.

984
01:12:41,969 --> 01:12:42,629
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of cool.

985
01:12:42,829 --> 01:12:44,750
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll probably have a pretty easy step chart, but that's okay.

986
01:12:44,770 --> 01:12:47,271
[SPEAKER_02]: The noobs need something to play, and that's a good song, I think.

987
01:12:47,791 --> 01:13:02,536
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're going to go into another song, and this song is from DDR Universe, and I have a feeling this might be a little bit of a controversial song because they've taken an old Konami classic and really remixed the heck out of it, so it's interesting.

988
01:13:03,076 --> 01:13:09,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine your favorite gothic whipping game of all time with a big band swing sound.

989
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:11,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm not even kidding.

990
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:17,363
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Castlevania the Freestyle and Mix, Wave Group featuring Mickey G. See what you think.

991
01:13:17,403 --> 01:13:20,945
[SPEAKER_02]: This is coming to DDR Universe here on the Orange Lounge Radio Sneak Peeks.

992
01:15:07,025 --> 01:15:11,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Castelvania, The Freestyle and Mix, Orange Lounge Radio, DDR, Sneak Peaks

993
01:15:27,017 --> 01:15:31,458
[SPEAKER_04]: You actually get either Vampire Killer or I think Bloodlines, depending on who you play.

994
01:15:31,858 --> 01:15:36,140
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Maria gets Vampire Killer, and it's sort of a similar mix to that.

995
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:43,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, that style of music has shown up in Dracula X on the PC Engine Duo.

996
01:15:43,762 --> 01:15:48,564
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can't help but imagine Alucard in the shiny jacket getting down, you know, all BG style, right?

997
01:15:48,684 --> 01:15:49,064
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit?

998
01:15:50,144 --> 01:15:52,745
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, this is nothing new from Konami.

999
01:15:52,765 --> 01:15:53,105
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1000
01:15:53,305 --> 01:15:53,985
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1001
01:16:15,419 --> 01:16:16,960
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played that game in like a year.

1002
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:21,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Chatroom is also yelling that we're not acknowledging Supernova that's coming out next week.

1003
01:16:21,882 --> 01:16:25,183
[SPEAKER_02]: And should I point out, Loki actually already mentioned it, hello, in his upcoming releases.

1004
01:16:26,064 --> 01:16:28,725
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, you guys already have heard the Supernova VR at this point.

1005
01:16:28,745 --> 01:16:30,846
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have anything new for you regarding that.

1006
01:16:31,286 --> 01:16:35,148
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do have something new for you from DDR Ultramix 4, another track here.

1007
01:16:35,808 --> 01:16:39,390
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a song called Electric Air, and it's by an artist called Amit.

1008
01:16:40,130 --> 01:16:42,491
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a simple four-letter name there, A-M-I-T, Amit.

1009
01:16:43,056 --> 01:16:45,443
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's called Electric Air here on the DDR Sneak Previews.

1010
01:16:45,483 --> 01:16:45,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out.

1011
01:16:46,045 --> 01:16:46,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1012
01:18:24,346 --> 01:18:26,027
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1013
01:18:52,017 --> 01:18:52,999
[SPEAKER_02]: So is Toe Jam.

1014
01:18:53,279 --> 01:18:54,441
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our last song tonight.

1015
01:18:54,501 --> 01:18:58,867
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Big Idea with Return of the Toe Jam here on the Orange Lounge Radio.

1016
01:18:59,168 --> 01:18:59,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Beep, beep.

1017
01:20:42,990 --> 01:20:47,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Return of the Toe Jam by Big Idea, coming soon to DDR Universe.

1018
01:20:47,252 --> 01:20:48,113
[SPEAKER_04]: That was cool.

1019
01:20:48,493 --> 01:20:52,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I just, I expect Minnie Pearl to come out towards the end of that song and go, Hi!

1020
01:20:54,336 --> 01:20:55,096
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's a great song.

1021
01:20:55,116 --> 01:20:56,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Minnie Pearl!

1022
01:20:57,717 --> 01:21:00,639
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's, you know, it's not, again, it's interesting.

1023
01:21:00,679 --> 01:21:04,621
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of the songs we've played tonight kind of have this common theme where, like, you know,

1024
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:08,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people probably really liked it, and some people didn't like it so much.

1025
01:21:09,001 --> 01:21:13,762
[SPEAKER_02]: But hopefully there was one of those four, at least, if not three, that you really dug.

1026
01:21:13,802 --> 01:21:15,423
[SPEAKER_02]: And me personally, I kind of dug them all.

1027
01:21:15,563 --> 01:21:19,964
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not just saying that because of the... Trust me, if I thought one of them sucked, I'd tell you.

1028
01:21:20,344 --> 01:21:23,525
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think they're all pretty cool, so the game should be interesting.

1029
01:21:24,585 --> 01:21:30,727
[SPEAKER_04]: I have actually done square dancing when I was younger, much younger.

1030
01:21:31,423 --> 01:21:32,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Square Dance Revolution

1031
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:01,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Konami, you listening?

1032
01:22:01,061 --> 01:22:02,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Square Dance Revolution.

1033
01:22:02,102 --> 01:22:02,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Make it happen.

1034
01:22:02,703 --> 01:22:03,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.

1035
01:22:04,345 --> 01:22:06,387
[SPEAKER_02]: They gave us Karaoke Revolution Country.

1036
01:22:06,407 --> 01:22:08,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Karaoke Revolution Country sold, didn't it?

1037
01:22:08,229 --> 01:22:11,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I played that at E3, though, so I could sing Good Old Boys.

1038
01:22:12,053 --> 01:22:12,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, give me a break.

1039
01:22:12,914 --> 01:22:15,257
[SPEAKER_04]: To get my Dukes of Hazzard on.

1040
01:22:15,898 --> 01:22:20,303
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I played it at Konami Gamers Day, and there was some Shania song I sung in it.

1041
01:22:20,839 --> 01:22:21,279
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.

1042
01:22:21,399 --> 01:22:22,059
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember.

1043
01:22:22,079 --> 01:22:22,479
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a while.

1044
01:22:22,499 --> 01:22:23,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Shania is awesome.

1045
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:25,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I even know you two anymore?

1046
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:26,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently.

1047
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:27,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, line dancing revolution.

1048
01:22:28,041 --> 01:22:28,981
[SPEAKER_04]: See, there's a difference.

1049
01:22:29,021 --> 01:22:34,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Line dancing is kind of like stupid cheerleading para para, but score dancing is kind of cool.

1050
01:22:37,623 --> 01:22:37,964
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1051
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:41,064
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to go take a break so we can reminisce some more.

1052
01:22:41,184 --> 01:22:47,326
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to do it for our part A, but we'll be back in a little bit with part B of our podcast.
