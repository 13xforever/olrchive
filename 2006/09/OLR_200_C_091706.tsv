487	19077	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
20166	26089	And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this very special Part C to celebrate our 200th episode.
26129	31751	Now, I want to warn you guys, if this is your first time downloading Orange Lounge Radio, this is going to be a little bit different.
31771	44577	This is not your typical segment of Orange Lounge Radio, so I urge you to check out OrangeLoungeRadio.com and dip back in our podcast feed and check out Parts A and B. We envision this section of the show to be a little more like our afterbirth segment.
44617	46218	For those that listen live, you know what that is.
46278	48219	It's a little bonus thing we do just for the live listeners.
49039	50720	We do have a little bit more game news.
50760	62583	We just filled up with stuff in Part B and just had a little more we wanted to talk about here in Part C. But first, before we get to that gaming news, what we did is we brought in a little bit of champagne.
62643	64724	I promised there would be liquor tonight in one form or another.
65624	67745	We're going to do a toast here to our 200th episode.
68125	70305	So does anyone want to make the toast or should I just do it or what?
70325	71466	Anyone want to say a little bit?
71486	71986	All right.
72186	72406	All right.
72711	73892	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
102133	103574	That's some good Korbel.
106977	108078	You're not a big champagne fan?
108578	112221	I like champagne, but I really like it in a good mimosa.
115744	118287	When we reach 300, we toast Guinness.
118467	119948	250 is a big number too, I don't know.
121049	124732	I think it's going to be more at the 5th birthday, because 5th birthday is pretty big, so we'll see.
125310	129454	But anyway, Jamie already burped the Korbel.
129514	130235	That's amazing.
130375	131356	That's some fizzy stuff.
131376	132217	That is amazing.
132537	135881	All right, we have a little bit of extra stories here for you guys.
135921	136161	Loki?
136782	144089	Yes, lots of fun stuff for Part C. Anyways, I really shouldn't be paying attention.
144169	145791	Thank you, chat room, for your well wishes, by the way.
148205	150187	There's been a lot of rumors going around about the 360.
151488	158853	One that keeps popping back up is Microsoft's going to release a brand new 360 with an internal HD DVD drive.
159892	162213	Well, once again, they have said no.
162513	166454	We are not releasing a SKU with an HD DVD drive.
166494	179659	It says, turns out you want to say in how you spend your, or turns out you want to say in how you spend your entertainment dollars, so who are the ones, or, so who are we to burden every customer with the cost of expensive movie technology?
180820	181100	Ooh!
181120	183681	Serve, Sony!
184981	185101	Ouch.
187008	190030	That was Bill Gates whipping it out right there.
190790	194272	No, that was actually a generic Microsoft employee.
194412	197374	Sorry, that was a Microsoft employee whipping out their cock.
197394	198955	No, that was one of their technical writers.
199696	200096	I see.
201036	202978	This is why I'm in school, to be a tech writer.
203998	204258	All right.
204278	206360	So that I, too, can whip out the corporate cock.
210482	212203	I don't need a corporate cock, I just need a cock.
213464	214425	Your girlfriend's is still bigger.
214825	215045	Anyway.
215065	215145	Okay.
217434	220796	Hi, Megzi!
221857	222517	We love you!
225039	234065	Anyway, there is actually the GameU College Tour will be making the rounds.
234145	238287	It will be featuring the Xbox 360, Xbox, and PC gaming.
238888	240228	The tour will last three months.
242377	245480	and it will hit up 40 different college campuses.
245560	253206	It's produced by Game Informer, Norsent TV and Mountain Dew and a bunch of other folks.
253906	258810	And it's going to hopefully reach 90,000 different people.
259751	268378	Some of the titles that are included are Madden NFL 07, blah, blah, blah, Rainbow Six, Saints Row, Mortal Kombat, Armageddon,
269830	275880	America's Army Special Forces, Splinter Cell Double Agent, blah blah blah, Project Gotham 3, Dead Rising.
275900	278244	In other words, all the games Jamie does not enjoy playing.
278465	279126	Hey, Dead Rising!
279507	280148	Okay, that's cool.
280428	281450	Dead Rising was hot.
283095	287779	And there will be a Madden NFL 07 football field goal competition.
288380	291622	And the winners take home $1,000 as the prize.
291803	298248	And Game Informer will have a Halo 2 competition each place with an unnamed prize, it seems.
298809	304634	So the tour starts on September 14th at the University of Arizona in Tucson.
306255	308897	Other schools that will be visited will be...
310735	311555	Just general places.
311755	317217	They will be going to Austin, Texas, University of Texas, University of Missouri, Wichita State.
317798	318818	I'm just listing a few.
318878	325280	Vanderbilt, Northern Kentucky, Temple University, Penn State.
326341	331703	They'll be going to, I guess, State University of New York.
331923	332483	Is that what it is?
334004	334504	In Buffalo.
335224	337065	And Miami University of Ohio.
338125	338906	That always makes me laugh.
338966	339966	And, of course, Notre Dame.
341103	343146	All right.
343827	348693	Well, if the game isn't coming to you, maybe you need to bring the game with you everywhere you go.
349034	351056	Now, you know those little plug-and-play things, right?
351096	352879	The little joysticks you can plug into your TV.
352899	354641	You see them sell these at Target all the time, right?
355014	358235	Well, these things are getting smaller and smaller, and now check this out.
358495	361295	They now have keychain plug-and-plays.
361715	369076	A little teeny Atari joystick and a little teeny Atari paddle that you can take with you to play games on the go.
369877	371337	They have actual games in these.
371437	374297	It's an included six-foot cable that comes with it.
374637	380098	It's on a battery-powered reel, and you put it on the keychain here, and then you can plug it in and play.
380458	383099	There's one joystick that will have asteroids and millipede,
383479	389181	another with Centipede and Yar's Revenge, and then the paddle will have Pong, Breakout, and Warlords.
389921	390782	That's crazy.
391622	395983	The keychain comes with a separate pocket-sized reel that holds six feet of cords and RCA jacks.
396304	401966	It's powered by three AAA batteries, single player only, however, since it is just a little keychain.
402366	402686	That's crazy.
402706	405827	I wonder what the original Atari programmers think of these.
406480	407381	I know, I gotta wonder.
407401	413323	That's at Next Classic Gaming Expo that they do, because, you know, they skipped a year for Classic Gaming Expo so they could do the 10th anniversary.
413503	413724	Right.
413864	417465	I'm definitely going and I'm going to ask them what they think of that, because that's just crazy.
418986	425409	GS68 says, I'm left-handed, I demand a lefty stick or I will refuse to buy Atari 2600 or related crap.
425990	429031	DarkTetsuya in our chat says, shame the paddle won't link up with three others.
429871	431092	So, sad.
432242	436666	Okay, well, what we're going to do now, I think that was about all the gaming news we have.
436686	439648	We'll get some last minute stories in a minute if any folks have stuff.
439668	441149	Well, first, we have these.
441189	443791	I wanted to play these since we are celebrating our 200th episode.
444352	448135	We got sent a surprise from All Games, our buddies at All Games.
448515	451357	So, I was going to go ahead and play this so we could hear this.
454480	456761	Hey, Krop, did you hear the news?
457542	457902	What news?
458643	461365	Orange Lounge Radio is doing their 200th episode this week.
462185	462445	What?
464386	462445	200?
465026	466486	Yeah.
467247	469667	Nice dedication for you.
469687	470127	200 shows.
470147	470127	200.
470287	472348	That's a lot.
472368	473849	Yeah, it is.
475349	479110	Do you think we'll ever reach that level of dedication?
479130	481351	Well, my contract is only for 30.
483231	483952	You have a contract?
483972	484052	Oops.
490788	498792	Hey there, this is Scott from All Games Interactive wishing the guys and girls at Orange Lounge Radio a happy 200th episode.
499292	502954	Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki, you guys kick ass.
502974	508637	In fact, to celebrate, we are going to spend the next four days playing DDR and listening to DDR music.
508917	515100	So, from everyone here at the Arena Lounge... Congratulations, OLR!
515240	516321	...on 200 episodes.
516341	517141	You guys rock.
517702	519162	I love you.
523638	527320	Do you realize how cool it'd be if I could actually play V and have it sound like this?
527420	530881	Oh, anyway, Bobby Blackwolf here from that show that comes on before you guys.
531401	531861	200, eh?
532382	533002	Y'all cheated.
533642	535463	Counting all those years of internet radio and all.
535943	538864	But don't worry, Scott's funky episode numbering will catch up in about a month.
539545	543826	But seriously, y'all were one of the reasons I started podcasting and I enjoy you guys each week.
544567	546187	Good luck to all of you in the future.
546768	549049	And make sure it doesn't go downhill from here.
551210	551990	Someone had to say it.
555543	556743	That was wonderful.
556943	558004	That was so cute.
558024	558864	That was so cute.
558924	560084	I don't know what else to say.
560324	563705	Just the thing that had me cracking was, you had a contract?
564025	566206	That was Kropotkin and Hendrix from the show Between Us.
566506	570127	You know, who were all those people at Arena yelling in the background there?
570167	571747	That was kind of interesting.
571988	572788	They hired people.
573288	575168	Yeah, they must have hired stand-ins to do that.
575268	575849	That's great.
575869	578309	Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
578329	578489	What?
578509	579830	I want my second glass of champagne.
581370	581970	Good for you.
583431	584511	Did you want my glass of champagne?
585410	586631	That was unintentional.
602222	603363	Scott's full of shit sometimes.
604323	606004	I wonder if he's really going to do, yeah, sometimes.
606284	608405	I wonder if he's really going to do four days of DDR.
608725	610285	I cannot picture him playing DDR.
610566	612666	But if they do, is Black Boy still listening?
613027	613727	Oh, no, I don't think he is.
613787	615988	Somebody videotape it over at Arena Lounge.
616868	619929	God damn it, that Rob shit in the chat room needs to stop right now.
622951	624091	They are just flooding our chat.
624111	626332	You know, I've done that since, like, what, episode one?
626372	627453	I think so.
627893	628213	All right.
628874	633498	Well, all games, we love those guys, and thank you guys so much for getting in on that and putting that together for us.
633518	634099	That was awesome.
635120	638343	Our fans also decided to ambush our voicemail line this week.
638843	640104	I know, we have fans on our website too.
640344	644248	Well, we had some voicemails hit our voicemail line this week, so we're going to play that as well.
645109	647130	Hello, Orange Lounge Radio.
647791	649773	Happy 200th episode.
650493	651174	Thank you.
651915	652976	I love you guys.
653776	654617	You're a lover.
655098	655238	No.
656070	662454	I'm calling to congratulate you guys on your 200th episode.
683553	694995	I don't know many podcasts at all, I'll be honest, but you guys have been around for a while, I've heard about you for a while, I just started being a part of the station in a bigger way, and I love you guys.
695335	697055	Keep up the good work, here's to another 200.
697095	699196	You guys all take care.
699336	700456	Hey, it's Miss Steve.
712765	721409	and I'm pretty certain that I'm going to be listening tonight anyway, but I just wanted to say in a more personal way, congrats on reaching episode 200.
721910	722210	Bye.
725691	726152	Wow.
726612	727532	That was really sweet, you guys.
727552	728373	Thank you very much.
731274	738978	I know, I like the guy, I think it was Yuri Lever who sounded like he was talking and he just had this... Red vs. Blue, who is that?
739930	740331	Caboose!
740371	740791	Caboose!
740851	741792	He sounded like Caboose!
743153	744974	I have to go to the bathroom now.
744994	745174	Uh-oh.
745194	745274	What?
745294	746035	What'd he say?
746115	746835	Are you getting it?
746875	747976	We can't hear it.
747996	753120	We can't hear it.
753260	753681	What's he saying?
753701	755362	Just tell us what he's saying.
755422	755462	No.
769349	770370	Oh yeah, put on speakerphone.
771170	771590	One second.
771630	772551	We warned you guys it would be random.
773571	773811	Okay.
775592	776172	Is this your husband?
776332	776833	This is Dan.
776893	777113	Okay.
777633	778033	Say it again.
779634	782815	Congratulations on your 200th episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
783356	785657	Man, I didn't think you'd make it to, you know, two.
785677	787017	We didn't think we'd make it to two either.
787057	787198	Wow.
787218	788558	That was nice.
788618	789979	Everybody's getting in on the love.
789999	790699	You're still on speakerphone.
802328	803188	Close the damn phone.
803208	804229	We got other stuff to get to.
804649	805229	Tell him to wait.
805249	806750	Bye, sweetie.
807430	807811	All right.
810112	810432	Dork.
811533	813353	Yes, I'm saying this on the radio.
813434	814694	My husband is a dork.
815695	816855	Yes, he buys you pinball.
817276	819777	But he brings me pinball, so that's why I keep him around.
820537	821458	This is great radio.
821498	823219	You know, we're all drinking champagne.
823239	823579	What can I say?
823599	824980	This is the second time Dan's been on the show.
825040	826360	This is great champagne.
827801	829042	Any last-minute stories tonight?
829082	829342	Loki.
829895	831715	Yes, of course I have stuff.
831895	836816	Anyways, the first thing I want to talk about is release dates, because of course I have stuff.
837296	841617	And it's all very interesting and always very controversial.
842157	848298	This mostly is from Sega, who we've had some problems with in the past about Fantasy Star Universe.
848338	853039	But anyways, let's talk about next-gen, shall we?
853319	857280	Virtual Fighter V for the PlayStation 3 is slated to come out...
858038	860759	March 15th of next year, so look forward to that.
860999	869722	Also, you know, Gracie and her presence will be Virtual Tennis 3 for both the PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360, and the PSP.
869902	873843	All those coming out on the 21st of March next year.
875384	879725	This one we ran on the site also, and this is probably the first you'll hear of it.
880666	884107	Full Auto 2 coming to the PSP March 14th.
885345	887486	So it's not just PlayStation 3 anymore.
887826	889186	Very interesting on that.
890467	897869	And then this one, which is very controversial, since there was some news from FromSoftware that this version might be not coming out.
898549	905732	Coming from Sega, Armored Core 4 on both the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360, March 21st.
906212	912334	These dates were just updated in our system on the 11th of September, so this is very fresh news.
913552	917454	Also, Afterburner for the PSP coming out March 21st as well.
917574	922497	So, look for those wonderful Sega games March of next year.
923617	926499	Alright, I'm going to open up the Skype line over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
926519	930101	Click on Interact With Us or you can always call us on the regular telephone as well.
930141	930301	It's 916-226-9067.
933007	935629	I imagine the sky plane is going to be very popular tonight.
935669	937090	We'll get through as many calls as we can.
937130	938912	We're practically dedicating a whole segment to it.
938952	939332	We'll see.
940253	943095	Well, they're already coming in, so let's pick up a call and start going.
943395	944456	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
944476	944856	Who's this?
945417	946137	This is Megzi.
946157	947798	Hi, Megzi.
947978	948939	How are you, Megzi?
949299	950440	Wow, I just went deaf.
950460	951161	I am fantastic.
951281	953703	From all the girly screaming in here, I think I just went deaf.
954463	955004	What's on your mind?
956205	956525	We.
957386	958046	We.
958567	961589	Are you excited about the We News, or are you just celebrating our 200th episode with us?
962691	963171	A little bit of both.
963511	964012	All right.
964112	965252	You definitely going to be getting a Wii?
966093	966673	Oh, man.
967554	974858	The morning after I knew, I had called my GameStop at 9 in the morning to see if we could do reserves yet, and unfortunately we couldn't.
974898	976359	But yes, I will be getting a Wii.
977139	977719	All right.
978500	979500	What games do you want to pick up?
979760	982462	I would like to stress that I predicted the date.
984088	985190	How did you predict the date?
985230	986432	Did you just pull it out of your butt?
997316	998557	that holiday season.
999418	1009727	And the PS3 launches on a Friday, the 17th is a Friday, and I know Nintendo likes to launch their systems on Sundays, so I said, hey, Sunday the 19th, that could be their release date.
1009747	1010468	That's my prediction.
1011148	1016493	And then not three hours later, the information got leaked that it was going to be released on that Sunday.
1017234	1023679	I'm sitting here looking at a text message on my phone that says, November 19th, from Megzi.
1024020	1024420	Ha ha ha!
1025216	1027778	Well, good job on that, making an educated guess to do it.
1027858	1031141	So, your internet penis grew by two inches for that.
1031181	1033763	Congratulations.
1033843	1035024	I've also got a funny story.
1035284	1035504	Okay.
1035544	1036525	Yeah, the funny story.
1037085	1041709	Okay, so, lately I've been trying to catch up on games that I might have missed.
1042409	1045051	You know, like they came out and they were great, but for some reason I didn't pick them up.
1045612	1048234	So, the other day I picked up Metroid Prime, right?
1048774	1051496	Because I never got a chance to play it and I wanted to try it out.
1052137	1052357	So...
1053078	1058100	After I got off work, I called Chris, and... Chris is looking angry at this story already.
1058360	1061001	Oh, she's just like... Alright, let's hear it.
1061021	1069223	So, I called up Chris, and I was like, so this is what I did during my day, and I picked up Metroid Prime, and she says, oh, is that the one with the monkey?
1073284	1074685	Oh, poor Chris.
1076585	1078026	We love you, Chris.
1078186	1081487	And so, we decided we're going to make a game called Metroid Primate.
1083178	1084298	I thought it was a different game.
1084378	1086439	I did not claim to be an expert on video games.
1087119	1089060	I know, but Metroid and a monkey.
1089360	1091701	What was your... I'm going to prove to you.
1091841	1092862	I thought it was a different game.
1092882	1095062	That's why you thought it was like Dungeon Siege or something.
1095202	1095963	No, I didn't.
1096203	1097103	I thought it was an RP.
1097123	1098403	Megzie, it's Dungeon Zoo.
1098724	1099084	Shut up.
1099384	1101345	Dungeon Zoo.
1101405	1106506	I'm still going... Megzie, we need to start doing pictures of Metroid primates.
1107107	1107627	Hells yeah.
1107907	1108287	All right.
1110004	1111085	Heart, we love you, Chris.
1111105	1112266	You hear this?
1112346	1113426	She's invited the biteage.
1113786	1118789	I do want to point out, though, WonderDogHerald in our chatroom says, Samus with a pet monkey would be the best.
1120189	1123351	I bet she'd... She had a pet monkey.
1123391	1124191	We love you, Chris.
1124211	1129974	Speaking of pets, you heard this week that they announced Seaman 2 for the PlayStation 2 coming out.
1130054	1130754	Tee hee.
1131135	1131375	What?
1131395	1131675	Tee hee.
1133756	1134076	All right.
1134356	1137838	Macy, we've got to take some more calls because everybody's trying to get in tonight, but any last words?
1141644	1142885	Oh, Reggie, you're so fine.
1142905	1143385	You're so fine.
1143405	1144025	You blow my mind.
1144045	1144506	Hey, Reggie.
1144866	1145026	Hey.
1145506	1146026	All right.
1146326	1148447	Uh-oh, your girlfriend's getting upset that you're a Reggie fan.
1148907	1149548	I'm sorry.
1150368	1150648	All right.
1151709	1152569	Aw, Chris is pouting.
1152589	1153570	You want to say anything to Macy, Chris?
1154530	1156031	I love you, but I hate you.
1156051	1156891	I love you, too.
1156911	1158732	I hate you so much.
1160493	1160893	Hey, Chris.
1161213	1163634	You know what that... Macy, Macy, you know what that means, though?
1163834	1164474	You know what that means, though?
1164834	1165895	Makeup sex.
1166535	1167316	Ooh.
1167456	1167756	All right.
1167816	1168236	See you later.
1171161	1173363	I thought you were making a trip to Wisconsin pretty soon, Chris.
1173383	1174543	I know, I'm going next weekend.
1174584	1176044	And there's going to be lots of makeup sex.
1176345	1177325	Lots and lots of makeup sex.
1177665	1179547	Hi, you're on Orange... Whoa, we're getting feedback.
1179567	1180367	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
1180387	1180707	Who's this?
1181588	1182008	Uh, hello?
1182248	1182508	Hi.
1184409	1186631	Oh, this is, uh, Bob Coffey from the chat room.
1186951	1187952	Hi, Bob Coffey, what's on your mind?
1187972	1193115	We're getting a lot of feedback, some type of hum, humming hum hum from you, so ask your question and we'll answer it.
1193195	1198458	Okay, um, just like to congratulate you guys on the 200th episode, and, um,
1199289	1204192	Interesting thing about the Wii is... What's that?
1205252	1207233	Um... Hello?
1207593	1208274	Hi, we're here.
1208714	1210035	Get your thought out, please.
1210875	1221061	Okay, interesting thing about the Wii, though, is... The one... The fact, um... N64 launched at, um... Originally $249.
1222381	1224442	But right before they launched, they cut it to $199, so...
1227898	1229699	All right, very interesting thought.
1229819	1238504	Good chance Nintendo might just cut the price right at the last minute, kind of as a, you know, kicking it to the sand to Sony.
1238904	1240205	That would be an interesting technique.
1240866	1241166	We'll see.
1241206	1244988	And that's basically a comment I'd like to make, and...
1246587	1248309	Sorry about the shitty first call.
1248329	1248869	That's all right.
1248909	1249169	No, no.
1249189	1251131	You got a bad hum, so that's all right.
1251151	1253433	You'll be able to hear it and try to figure out what the problem is.
1253453	1254534	I got to let you go, though, buddy.
1254814	1255635	Thanks so much for the call.
1255655	1256756	We like hearing from new people.
1257116	1262541	Interesting thought that Nintendo 64 was going to be $249 when it first came out, and then they cut the price at the last minute.
1262581	1263382	Could that happen again?
1263802	1265844	I think the pack-in game kind of breaks the steel here.
1265884	1269647	I think with Wii Sports being in there, I think $250 is kind of set in stone.
1270188	1272190	I don't see it getting cut at the last minute, but who knows?
1272710	1273751	Anything's possible, right?
1274560	1274940	Right?
1275120	1278022	I think it all comes down to their feedback that you get from people.
1278523	1279383	Alright, let's go to another call.
1279403	1280244	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
1280264	1280584	Who's this?
1281825	1283666	Greetings, my brethren and sister-in.
1285167	1286367	This is Mel B, actually.
1286648	1287608	Hi, Mel!
1287668	1287828	Hi!
1287908	1288469	Wow!
1288969	1290490	Mel, you were here forever ago.
1290510	1293372	You've known of Orange Launch Radio since episode, like, six.
1294380	1296282	Pretty much.
1296322	1299384	I've seen you in, like, what, maybe three different studios already?
1299484	1301706	Yeah, we've been to a lot of different places.
1301886	1303488	We've gotten evicted from a lot of places.
1304008	1304829	What's on your mind, buddy?
1305669	1310453	Oh, well, you know, it's 200, and you know I had to weigh in, you know, say congratulations to you guys.
1310834	1311634	Appreciate it.
1312295	1320081	You know, it's just, I'm just really proud of how you guys have grown, like, within this 194 episodes, I guess, since I'd first seen you.
1320702	1323304	I mean, I can remember back in the day when, you know, it was like,
1323752	1336462	You guys would have to be scrapping to get contact left and right and like, you know, I'd be trying to hook you up with this and now you guys are like making a name on your own and it's like, you know, I can just fade in the background and I mean, you guys have just been darn good ever since.
1336823	1340505	Well, we appreciate you, you know, taking a chance on the show when it was such a little deal.
1340525	1343308	You know, you were a big name in the DDR scene for freestyle and everything.
1343328	1345590	Well, still are too, just, you know, DDR in general.
1345950	1352295	You know, you haven't had a lot of tournaments lately but, you know, you came on our show kind of early on and a lot of people recognize you from freestyle so,
1353048	1353549	That's great.
1353769	1356931	And, you know, it kind of enabled us to be all friends and stuff after that.
1357071	1360313	Yeah, it was kind of a big thing to have Mr. DDR Idol on there.
1360333	1362715	Cutting one of those first radio promos for you back then.
1362735	1363895	Yeah, it was awesome.
1364156	1367518	So what do you think of the DDR scene now versus four years ago when the show started?
1368699	1379766	I think, I mean, a lot of it's kind of, I mean, it's been a major shift, whereas before it was sort of like a, kind of like a 60-40 split, whereas like Freestyle was bringing in a lot of casual people in.
1380137	1383738	But now it's become such a technical sport now with Perfect Attack and whatnot.
1383838	1385578	It's pretty much a standard now.
1385659	1389960	Freestyle is sort of like, I think people just aren't pushing each other nowadays to be better.
1390020	1392720	They're just kind of like waiting for some tournament to come around.
1392740	1395301	They're just doing something good enough to win.
1395381	1398362	So there really just isn't that progress forward quite yet.
1398882	1403783	And I don't see one up because Supernova's got so many darn songs that, you know, people were begging for.
1403883	1405524	But, you know, what can you do?
1405604	1405844	I mean...
1406263	1411825	I'm sure I'm going to break out some more routines sooner or later, but, you know, until then, I guess I'll just be laying in the cut.
1412205	1417067	Is In The Groove partially to blame for Freestyle going down and PA going up?
1419468	1434473	Well, I mean, there just wasn't that much to do in In The Groove for Freestyle, but I think kind of, I think with Freestyle it was just sort of like to the point where I think, I mean, just kind of looking back now, just in retrospect, I think a good Freestyle sort of has a very short
1435850	1447618	LifeSpan, I guess if you could say, it's sort of like you're hot for a good six months or a year, but then afterward, it's like judges, you know, get tired of your act and, you know, they want to see something new, but no one who's really stepped up since like 2003, 2004.
1449199	1452682	So, well, I hope Supernova can turn some of that around.
1452702	1453422	I guess we'll see, huh?
1454423	1454843	I'm pretty sure.
1454903	1459767	I mean, I do know some people that are still hungry and waiting for their big chance to, you know, break out on the team that I think...
1460675	1467320	It's got to be the onuses on a lot of people who are big into freestyle community that still have name value to put together events.
1467340	1470122	It doesn't even have to be like a tournament for a thousand bucks or whatever.
1470142	1476166	If you just get good get-togethers, you know, just videotape it and, you know, just get the word around by, you know, whatever.
1476306	1476706	YouTube.
1476786	1478167	We'll get people back into Spain.
1478488	1478688	Yeah.
1479028	1482590	Well, it'll be very interesting to see what happens, you know, in the future and everything.
1482650	1485272	And I know OLR wants to do some type of DDR tournament.
1485332	1486173	We've got some ideas.
1486233	1487594	So we'll see what happens in the future.
1488240	1490502	You can definitely count on me to give you a hand with that one.
1490682	1491383	Appreciate it, buddy.
1491403	1493205	We've got to let you go to take more calls, so thanks so much.
1493265	1495146	It's really good to hear from you on this landmark episode.
1495847	1497108	Thanks, man.
1497168	1501072	Congratulations to all you three, and Madden rules, and screw you guys for hating it.
1501092	1502233	We don't hate Madden.
1502253	1502773	We don't hate it.
1502813	1506016	We just don't, you know, freaking foam at the mouth over it, but, you know.
1506997	1508458	Different strokes for different folks.
1509139	1510040	Okay, but it's all good.
1510100	1510700	Y'all take it easy.
1510720	1511061	It's all good.
1511081	1511661	Have a good one, buddy.
1512202	1512322	Later.
1512342	1512522	Later.
1513686	1517047	Alright, you mean Roster Update 2006 is the actual name of the game.
1517087	1517608	No, I'm teasing.
1517648	1518448	Let's go to another call.
1518768	1519728	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
1519748	1520109	Who's this?
1521209	1522610	Hey, this is SSJ100 Matt.
1522770	1523830	Hi, SSJ100 Matt.
1523850	1524450	What's on your mind, buddy?
1525611	1530793	I just wanted to congratulate you on the 200 episodes and everything.
1532013	1533254	Well, we appreciate that a lot, buddy.
1534774	1536035	What's on your mind with all the Wii news?
1537175	1537335	What?
1537615	1538776	What's on your mind with all the Wii news?
1541468	1543229	I'm just thinking about my bank account, really.
1544789	1546209	Are you going to be getting a PS3, too?
1549150	1550211	I'll be selling a PS3.
1550251	1553132	Oh, you're going to do one of those eBay things.
1553972	1554312	Oh, yeah.
1554712	1555452	Oh, shame on you.
1556092	1557973	All right, anything else you want to get out for our listeners tonight?
1559433	1565195	No, I just wanted to make a shout-out to all my New York people, Ranma and...

1592062	1594324	hey it's Solar Wing again hi what's on your mind Solar Wing?
1595344	1596165	two things yep
1597025	1601409	First, congratulations on having 200 episodes.
1601549	1602250	Thank you very much.
1602270	1603090	I appreciate it.
1603791	1609436	I have a few friends with their podcasts and trying to get first live radio and then podcast.
1610437	1612038	It's amazing that you guys have made it this far.
1612098	1614120	It's a big landmark.
1614460	1616522	We're amazed, too, that we've lasted this long.
1616602	1617643	It's something else.
1617743	1624069	I think probably it's crossed all three of our minds at one point or another that we wanted to quit, but there's something that always brings us back.
1625385	1626385	I never do that.
1627466	1629746	I will admit, there was one week where it was pretty bad.
1629786	1632447	I was having a really emo week and I was about ready to come on here and go, I quit!
1633407	1641348	But, you know, in the end, it's really, you know, it's about you guys and about, you know, of course, Loki and DarkSakura, just getting to hang out with them every week and everything.
1641388	1647290	And while we may have our ups and downs sometimes, you know, it all comes back to games here at Orange Launch Radio, so it's good.
1648310	1649430	It's the great equalizer.
1651170	1654251	The second thing was, I saw the Nintendo Wii Plus conference
1654764	1656644	Oh, what'd you think?
1657084	1659225	Well, yay that it's coming out so early.
1659765	1661905	I was half thinking it was going to be delayed.
1662806	1664586	But, you know, they actually kept it.
1665466	1673688	And they also were talking about how you can put videos on the memory card and play them back.
1675208	1681689	Now, do you think with codecs and all that, do you think everything's going to work universally or you could just download something?
1683062	1686244	or pay 20 Wii Points and get the newest codec that works with everything?
1687185	1687886	Do you have a thought, Loki?
1688546	1694670	It's all up to the, you know, what they're running as far as graphics, you know, a graphics card in there.
1694991	1697893	Would it be licensing with the codecs, too, could come into play?
1698033	1699414	Some codecs are free, but yeah.
1699774	1702036	I mean, this is whatever they want to do.
1702116	1707740	I mean, I'm sure it's going to support, like, MPEG-2 and stuff like that because, I mean, they were basically kind of thinking...
1708544	1713085	Can you take your camcorder and you plug in your SD memory card from that into there and you get to watch videos.
1713745	1714386	Yeah.
1715686	1716046	All right.
1716066	1717887	Well, are you going to be picking up a Wii?
1719027	1719407	Oh, yes.
1719847	1720247	All right.
1720827	1724628	I'm picking up the PS3 and... You are going to get a PS3.
1725409	1726129	I told you I had to.
1726169	1729150	Oh, that's right, that's right, because you had to buy the one for your friend because of the bet and everything.
1729230	1730990	All right, well, you're not going to buy one for yourself?
1732511	1733771	Well, the Wii for myself, yes.
1733831	1734071	All right.
1734091	1736011	The PS3, hell no.
1736312	1736692	Why not?
1736752	1737832	Why no PS3 for yourself?
1738547	1742650	There's nothing at launch that really drives for me to get it.
1743490	1747513	Sony's going to have to sell it, really, really sell it to Tokyo Game Show to show us why we need one at launch.
1747613	1748274	It should be interesting.
1750755	1751036	Thanks.
1751516	1751956	No problem.
1752016	1755278	Hey, we've got to let you go, buddy, because we've got more calls coming in, but thanks so much for calling in tonight.
1755959	1756119	Bye.
1756279	1756779	All right, later.
1757560	1758461	Lots and lots of calls tonight.
1758481	1759181	We really appreciate it.
1759902	1760682	Let's go to another call.
1760702	1761923	Oh, my gosh, we're getting so many calls tonight.
1762623	1763724	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
1763764	1764184	Who's this?
1765385	1766206	Raven Stolfen.
1766386	1767146	Hi, Raven Stolfen.
1767166	1767807	What's on your mind, buddy?
1768942	1772023	Sorry I'm on my cell phone, but this is Skype's working.
1772283	1774764	That's alright, you know, we're getting hammered left and right tonight.
1774784	1775284	What's on your mind?
1777365	1780225	Uh, I got a hairline fracture on my DS.
1781166	1781946	How'd that happen?
1783566	1787728	I don't know, and I replaced it, and EB charged me 50 bucks for it.
1788128	1788448	Ouch!
1788808	1790949	You didn't have one of those replacement policy things or whatever?
1791989	1795850	No, I had it, but they'll trade it in, and you'll get a black one.
1796988	1798049	Oh, huh, interesting.
1798709	1800990	Was this a DS Lite that cracked, or a DS Fat?
1802190	1804131	Oh, it was a Lite, and I was pissed.
1804331	1806652	Wow, yeah, I got a lot of problems with that.
1806912	1811174	But didn't Nintendo do some type of replacement system, or was that just the UK?
1811274	1812634	I don't remember, it's been so long now.
1813775	1815755	They charge you 50 bucks to replace it?
1817276	1818076	Was it your fault?
1819737	1820537	No, it wasn't.
1820557	1822738	Here's the thing, they replaced it,
1823294	1824975	But it would only be a white one.
1825035	1827316	It wouldn't be a free black one, which pissed me off.
1828056	1828576	Oh, I see.
1828636	1831838	Well, did you have a black one or did you have a white one and you wanted to get a black one?
1832818	1835199	I had a white one and I wanted to get a black one.
1835219	1836780	Ah, well, that's why they charged you for it.
1837040	1838540	God, it's just a stinking color, though.
1838580	1842222	But I guess, you know, maybe there's more demand for the black ones right now or something.
1842262	1842582	I don't know.
1842842	1843742	Why would you want a black one?
1843762	1844643	It wouldn't match your Wii.
1846023	1847764	Well, everyone wanted a black one.
1847784	1849205	Didn't you say you wanted a pink one?
1849285	1850085	I want a pink one.
1851121	1853282	I almost bought one at Walmart, but I'm poor.
1854442	1856183	Because we don't make money off OLR.
1857524	1857984	But someday.
1859264	1859544	Someday.
1859925	1862286	Alright, Ravenstaff, anything else on your mind, Ravenstaff?
1862306	1863746	Because we have to get two more calls.
1864767	1865287	Oh, sure.
1865487	1866747	There's one more thing on my mind.
1866807	1867027	Yes.
1870129	1871469	They're doing the right thing with it.
1873050	1873350	How so?
1874929	1880854	because how the name is and how they're setting it up, they're really putting Sony in jeopardy this time.
1881734	1882215	We'll see.
1882355	1885057	We'll all see after the Christmas season when the numbers come out.
1885537	1886478	I think you might be right, though.
1887959	1889800	All right, I'm definitely trying to get a Wii.
1889961	1894484	I'm going to stand in the freezing cold on a Walmart or at EB.
1894624	1895685	I'm paying someone to get it.
1896218	1906502	Just let's hope that whole little thing about what they're supposedly doing in Hawaii with the whole $50 to reserve or $50 in trade-ins to reserve doesn't catch on nationwide because that's kind of poopy.
1907382	1907822	So we'll see.
1908102	1909183	Yeah, all right, guys.
1909223	1912824	So I'm going to cut it short and go because... All right.
1913044	1913925	It's all good, buddy.
1914645	1915085	Have a good one.
1915525	1915705	Bye.
1915905	1916226	Later.
1917546	1919887	Wow, we're just getting more and more calls.
1919907	1920767	We'll just keep it going.
1920807	1921127	Why not?
1921167	1922968	We have a whole other section of the show here tonight.
1923008	1924048	Let's go to another call.
1924108	1924949	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
1924969	1925249	Who's this?
1926002	1926623	It's me, Ranma.
1926663	1927283	What's up, fellas?
1927383	1928164	Hey, how you doing?
1928344	1928865	Hey, wait a minute.
1928885	1929725	I'm doing good.
1929826	1931567	I do not believe the lady sitting behind me is a fella.
1932688	1934450	Ranchan, how could you forget?
1935271	1938694	I splashed you with stupid stuff from China.
1938734	1939154	What can I tell you?
1939174	1939835	I am not cursed.
1940615	1940876	All right.
1941296	1942217	What's on your mind, Ranma?
1942757	1943138	Not much.
1943178	1943758	A few things.
1943818	1947001	I finally saw Dance Revolution yesterday, and it wasn't that bad.
1947522	1947822	Really?
1947922	1950164	I heard it was vomit in my mouth.
1950364	1951105	You know what's interesting?
1951125	1951165	No.
1951661	1955124	The show is not being carried in Sacramento, so we couldn't see it.
1955404	1957306	Wait, it's not on a CBS out there?
1957506	1958467	No, it's not on a CBS.
1958687	1961149	I looked at the preview guide and there was not anything there.
1961329	1962870	So kudos to KLVR 13.
1963591	1965933	Good job, guys.
1965993	1967254	No crap on that network.
1967294	1967654	Good job.
1967674	1968635	Does Viacom own them?
1969035	1972818	I don't know, but I heard there was no actual DDR stuff on the show.
1972839	1973299	There wasn't.
1973920	1976322	It's the same font, and that's about it.
1976922	1983846	It's basically Dance Fever with little kids, and it's a contest, and the grand prize is a $25,000 scholarship from Konami.
1983966	1985928	Okay, so why was that not shitty?
1986888	1988509	I don't know, because I thought it wasn't so bad.
1988569	1989650	It broke the mold.
1989730	1992292	Everybody was thinking it was going to be DDR this, DDR that, you know?
1994893	1996074	Are you a 12-year-old girl?
1996975	1997215	No.
1997495	1997895	Oh, okay.
1998075	1999596	Do you think 12-year-old girls will like the show?
2000957	2002218	I have no idea.
2003577	2005459	Banda in our chatroom says, fuck Dance Fever.
2006740	2007260	Fuck you too.
2007700	2007941	All right.
2008221	2009302	Anything else on your mind, buddy?
2010042	2019809	I wanted to say some other things, but I have here in my hands a 22-ounce ounce of Guinness, and I'm about to open it up, and I'm having a toast here for you guys.
2020430	2021230	I appreciate that.
2021491	2022151	A toast to you.
2022912	2023532	Here's to you.
2023772	2024373	Here's to me.
2024433	2025714	The best of friends we will be.
2025874	2028736	But if we should ever happen to agree, well, fuck you, and here's to me.
2028756	2029777	I'm down on this bitch right now.
2031443	2033064	Enjoy that Guinness, motherfucker.
2033084	2033924	I'll see you in October.
2034524	2035304	Got that shit right.
2035464	2035765	Later.
2038986	2040266	Let's go to one of our old favorites.
2040286	2041907	I've been making the poor bastard wait all night.
2042327	2043447	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2043467	2043887	Who's this?
2044848	2046208	One and only Legend of Zaku.
2046608	2048349	What's on your mind, Mr. Zaku?
2049145	2052086	Well, by just, you know, 200 episodes, man.
2052106	2056107	That's a feat right there that you can't accomplish without effort.
2056307	2061968	It wouldn't be a 200th episode without our 200 minutes worth of phone calls caller here, Zaku.
2062228	2062628	Yes.
2063228	2064149	Digital Life's coming up.
2064169	2064609	Are you excited?
2064629	2065969	Are you going to go see Final Fantasy XII?
2066689	2069190	Yeah, that and I'm trying to pick out a freestyle routine.
2069230	2071570	I'm trying to pick out a song, most importantly.
2071831	2074791	I kind of have a case of freestyler's block at the moment.
2074811	2076512	Alright, are you going to come visit me in October?
2076532	2077392	Because I'm coming to New York.
2077412	2077652	Yeah, I'm
2078357	2078577	Sweet.
2078597	2079237	Yeah, most likely.
2079398	2079878	Definitely.
2080038	2082859	I'll even give you the stuff that I'm a snag from Digital Life.
2083119	2084480	You gonna give us another signed poster?
2084500	2085400	Because that was pretty badass.
2085420	2086741	You got us the signed Indie Geek poster.
2086761	2089842	That depends if Rocks or Red Octane has something set up.
2090163	2090903	We'll take anything.
2090923	2091703	We like free things.
2092524	2093264	Oh, alright then.
2095205	2097786	You know Supernova's patch came out last week, right?
2097886	2098366	That's right.
2098406	2100147	We have a patch and there's a new song in it, right?
2100167	2100828	Some type of remix?
2101508	2103489	Fascination Eternal Love Remix.
2103529	2104129	Should be fun.
2104169	2104429	Yeah.
2104689	2105130	Should be fun.
2106534	2121346	It's basically a remix of Fascination Max, but with the sounds that you get from opening a door in a car, the little ringing sound, and just a lot of phone ringing right there.
2122867	2124409	I think you have the video up there on your site.
2125630	2125950	Okay.
2128352	2134357	Anyways, the last thing, I don't get how Nintendo flip-flops on what they say.
2135228	2141111	On one side, they said that it was going to be region-free, but on the other, they act as if it didn't exist.
2141131	2142032	They end up denying it.
2142292	2144373	Someone hasn't made a final decision on it.
2145134	2147315	The left hand's not talking to the right hand.
2147335	2149917	That's exactly what's going on.
2149957	2152298	Happens in corporate America all the time.
2152318	2163024	I was pretty excited on Thursday when I heard all these wonderful fairy tales about the Wii, and then all of a sudden, we have this little black eye that came days later.
2163725	2164325	That could have...
2165106	2167306	Was the news the end of the world, though, Zaku?
2168927	2171307	I mean, you know what?
2171387	2173467	Screw the Wii and PS3.
2173848	2175308	It's all about Happy Sky CS.
2175428	2175788	That's it.
2176928	2179789	I'm focusing all my energy on something besides the hype.
2179869	2181489	Beatmania is the only game you need, huh?
2182269	2183049	Yeah, pretty much.
2183129	2183449	All right.
2183569	2183989	Sounds fair.
2184049	2185109	We've got to let you go, Zaku.
2185129	2185690	We've got more calls.
2185750	2186350	All right.
2186390	2186790	Later, buddy.
2187390	2187630	Peace.
2188650	2189010	All right.
2189370	2190390	I think there's one more call.
2190430	2190850	He's coming in.
2191391	2192931	Hi, you're on... Oops, did I pick this up?
2193371	2193771	I thought I did.
2194369	2195709	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
2195729	2196169	Who's this?
2196790	2197950	Hi, it's Arcadian42.
2198310	2200791	Arcadian42, what's on your mind?
2200811	2207412	I had to call in because I haven't listened in a while and had a connection from the first show since I think I was there.
2207773	2208753	Or at least one of the first shows.
2208933	2214694	You were there on the first show and this is the most we've ever heard from you in like 200 episodes worth of shows.
2215875	2216795	You might have heard a little bit more.
2217015	2217615	No, I know.
2217695	2219656	We appreciate your support over the years, Arcadian42.
2219676	2219756	Yeah.
2221728	2227491	It's been less recently since I've been playing too many video games What do you think of the Wii?
2228592	2239839	It looks like it'll be interesting I haven't really been following the news but since I might have money soon I might actually be able to buy one Awesome Is that the system of choice amongst the three?
2240839	2247403	I don't know I'll have to see what I want Alright, sounds good Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
2248828	2249248	Not really.
2250108	2251989	Just congratulations on your 200 episodes.
2252529	2254669	Maybe I'll see you and come to a future show.
2254829	2255890	Yeah, anytime.
2255910	2256930	The door's open to you anytime.
2258150	2258450	Alright.
2258530	2259190	That's awesome.
2259210	2259750	Thank you so much.
2259770	2263871	It really means a lot to us that we have folks that remember us all the way from episode one still calling in.
2263931	2265452	I know you've been a long time supporter of the show.
2265772	2266932	We really appreciate it, my friend.
2267712	2267992	Alright.
2268212	2269092	Alright, have a good one, buddy.
2269612	2269912	You too.
2270112	2270393	Later.
2271773	2273933	Lots and lots of good... Let's do at least one more call here.
2273993	2275214	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2275254	2275674	Who's this?
2276874	2277454	AJ Twist.
2277887	2278647	Hi, what's on your mind?
2280168	2282788	Just calling in to say happy 200th birthday.
2283088	2283388	Thank you.
2283408	2287590	Yeah, practically it.
2287890	2288810	Seeing how you guys are.
2288830	2292111	Basically, I wanted to talk to DarkSakura about Tekken VR.
2292491	2292771	Okay.
2294891	2295572	DarkSakura?
2296272	2296892	Yes?
2297932	2299333	How are you liking the game?
2300833	2304894	I have to say that I like it a whole lot because I'm just such an uber Tekken fangirl that
2305914	2308815	It's all about... Though I always play with Jin every time.
2309435	2310216	But it's really fun.
2310236	2312257	I like that you have so many different characters to choose from.
2313177	2313657	It's pretty cool.
2313677	2320160	I don't know if you remember my letter I wrote in two, three, four months ago, maybe.
2321240	2322300	I wrote to Pink Yoshi.
2324201	2328423	I think... I seem to recall a handle named Pink Yoshi because I'm sure I would have made fun of it.
2329443	2330264	Yeah, yeah, you did.
2330284	2331024	I see.
2332805	2333785	Nothing personal, my friend.
2334794	2335495	No, that's all good.
2336315	2341499	But yeah, I'm still up for some good matches with you, DarkSakura, Tekken.
2341839	2343841	Someday, sometime.
2344421	2344881	Sometime.
2344962	2349905	Right now it's been kind of crazy busy, but I'm working on trying to set some time aside.
2350025	2356870	If I can ever wrestle the PSP away from Dan, except he's been... I'll have to take it when he's distracted with pinball.
2357230	2360152	You guys will have to set up some time on the Orange Ones Radio message forums.
2360793	2363595	Yeah, send me a message on the forums and we'll see about setting something up.
2364502	2365483	Are you aware of the ghost system?
2366464	2366644	Huh?
2367304	2367585	I'm sorry?
2367605	2368826	Are you aware of the ghost system?
2369646	2370267	No, actually.
2371468	2381336	If you play through the dojo, eventually you can unlock the ghost system which records your character as you play and act as your ghost and you can play that.
2381896	2383277	Other players can play that online.
2383698	2384358	Oh, that's pretty cool.
2384398	2384959	That's kind of neat.
2385299	2387661	I'll have to do that then.
2387761	2394166	Once you get that ghost, maybe you can somehow rip it out of the ESP and online send it over to me and I'll send you my ghost.
2396075	2396816	Wow, that's kind of neat.
2396836	2397916	I wish they did that for Mario Kart.
2397936	2399618	I have to set some time aside.
2400679	2402840	Check out Tekken, if I may plug in the site.
2403060	2405703	Is that all right?
2405723	2406243	Yeah, I missed that.
2406283	2406763	Tekken what?
2407824	2408765	Tekken Zaibatsu.
2409365	2410306	Oh, Tekken Zaibatsu?
2411227	2413829	Yeah, they have a little form on that, too.
2414089	2419773	Oh, yeah, I used to go to that site all the time to get all the pictures and everything from the official Namco art.
2420914	2421555	I haven't been to that.
2421575	2423556	I actually haven't been to that site in easily a year.
2423596	2424277	I forgot about it.
2425709	2427871	Yeah, it hasn't been too big lately.
2427891	2429152	Not much going on.
2429552	2430192	No, that's a cool site.
2430212	2430973	I'll have to check out the forum.
2431233	2431493	Thanks.
2432494	2433054	No problem.
2433234	2434095	All right, any other thoughts?
2434475	2435476	Yeah, oh, Loki?
2436836	2437057	Huh?
2437877	2441620	A question about the PSP on hacking it, since you're big on that.
2442560	2442880	What now?
2443541	2444641	A question on the PSP hacking.
2444761	2444982	Yeah.
2446322	2450005	Do you know any cool type of media players that can play playlists?
2450945	2451446	Hmm.
2452671	2454352	I can play playlists.
2454392	2459875	I know they had some stuff where you can stream like playlists from your PC.
2460735	2462116	Yeah, I know that one too.
2462376	2463597	What's the website you always use?
2463617	2464697	PSP Updates or something?
2464717	2466018	PSP Updates has a lot of stuff on there.
2466318	2466658	Check it out.
2466678	2468019	Yeah, I'll go check around there more.
2468419	2469200	Alright.
2469220	2469780	Thanks anyways.
2470240	2472301	Well, we gotta let you go, my friend.
2472321	2474442	We got some more calls to get through and then we're gonna end the show.
2475383	2478244	Yeah, happy 200th episode again and have a good night.
2478664	2478905	Alright.
2479265	2479825	Have a good one, buddy.
2481426	2481666	Bye-bye.
2483110	2484891	This number has been trying to hammer us for a little bit now.
2485491	2487052	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
2487072	2487412	Who's this?
2488313	2488833	I made it.
2489214	2489454	Hi.
2489514	2489774	Whoa.
2489834	2490054	Hi.
2490114	2490514	Who's this?
2491495	2492055	It's DT.
2492856	2493436	Oh, DT.
2493476	2494237	What's on your mind?
2495358	2499240	I've been trying to call in ever since the segment opened.
2499621	2499881	I know.
2499901	2501061	We've been hammered tonight.
2501122	2501862	It's crazy.
2501902	2502823	What's on your mind, my friend?
2505104	2507206	I just wanted to wish you guys a happy 200th.
2507866	2508627	Appreciate it.
2508647	2510688	You've been with us since episode one, right?
2511318	2512479	Oh yeah, absolutely.
2514139	2516600	Well, what do you think about the Wii news?
2516620	2517721	Are you going to be picking up a Wii?
2518821	2520442	I'll probably get one for Christmas.
2521602	2523163	What games in particular are you looking forward to?
2528325	2529646	Red Steel looks kind of cool.
2530666	2531427	Not Smash Bros.
2531447	2531767	Brawl?
2532367	2533568	Oh yeah.
2534208	2535208	You're pumped up for that, right?
2536269	2536629	Oh yeah.
2537620	2543764	So actually speaking of Unsmashed Brothers of Ballroom, are there any other characters that you wanted to see in it, either Konami or Nintendo?
2545806	2549509	Well, I was kind of hoping Lolo and Lala would be in it.
2550029	2550609	Oh, wow.
2551750	2552751	They're HAL characters?
2552771	2553471	Lolo and Lala.
2553732	2555393	Oh my god, that is old school.
2556634	2559356	What would they do, turn duels over?
2559456	2562057	They would turn your character into eggs and then push boxes at you.
2562678	2563298	There you go.
2563639	2564699	Way old school.
2566806	2567487	That's pretty cool.
2567987	2570509	Well, DT, I know you've been supporting us since episode one.
2570549	2572050	We really, really appreciate it.
2572350	2576394	Your enthusiasm for this station has been wonderful, and I know you work for our site now, and we love having you on board.
2576894	2577915	Thanks so much for calling in.
2578135	2578615	Anytime.
2578876	2579756	All right, have a good one, my friend.
2580757	2581157	You too.
2581317	2581678	Bye-bye.
2581758	2583119	We'll have to play DDR together someday.
2583319	2584820	I haven't seen him in a while.
2584860	2585461	He's local.
2585541	2586602	We, like, never see each other.
2586802	2587522	It's crazy.
2588703	2591846	DT, DarkSakura, he, like, lives just around the corner, practically.
2591866	2592406	We never see him.
2592666	2593247	It's kind of sad.
2594608	2595008	All right.
2595028	2595869	I see him at Dan's store.
2596950	2599132	I randomly run into him at Dan's GameStop.
2599332	2600954	Well, thank you guys so much for calling.
2600974	2601795	Oh, we got one more.
2601815	2602435	We'll make this real quick.
2603076	2603876	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
2603896	2604197	Who's this?
2607439	2607760	Oh, yes.
2607820	2608801	What's on your mind, Actdeft?
2609741	2610302	Gotta be quick.
2610362	2610562	Oh!
2610582	2611022	Thank you.
2611042	2612844	What's on your mind?
2612864	2613104	I agree.
2613124	2614706	The Wii is gonna be awesome.
2625037	2626578	Well, thank you so much for calling in.
2626598	2628600	We've got to keep it short, though, because we've got to get to our next segment.
2628620	2630521	That's awesome to hear from people outside of the U.S.
2630601	2631002	once in a while.
2631022	2633043	We love hearing from Canada, Mexico, U.K.
2633083	2633444	We love it.
2636026	2636506	Is he still there?
2636686	2636986	Hello?
2638167	2638928	There must be a delay.
2639668	2640269	I think he hung up.
2640589	2640829	Oh, well.
2641770	2641990	Oh, well.
2642010	2642471	Well, thank you.
2642651	2643371	Thanks for calling.
2643491	2643752	I know.
2643812	2646073	I think that's the first call from Mexico we've gotten.
2646474	2646854	I think so.
2646994	2647535	How sweet.
2648075	2648335	Cool.
2648355	2648836	Thank you.
2648856	2648936	Bye.
2649756	2650817	I'm going to go to Cabo someday.
2650897	2652338	I've never been to Mexico, but I want to go to Cabo.
2652478	2653559	I'm going to go to Tijuana.
2654100	2654420	All right.
2655773	2656753	We're going to do this now.
2657254	2658575	I warned you this would be a little bit random.
2659295	2671804	We're going to bring back a segment that you guys who listen to the old show know and those of you guys who joined us in the podcast maybe have never heard this segment before but it's been known to get a little bit weird and a little bit random and a little bit questiony.
2672304	2674966	It's this old segment called Ask Orange Lounge.
2681130	2682411	Let's Ask Orange Lounge.
2682939	2684080	Some stupid question.
2684560	2687822	Well, will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
2688243	2695248	I'm sure it's going to be interesting because we haven't allowed this segment on in over a year because the questions have been lame.
2699030	2701592	So let's see what you guys have pent up over the past year.
2703874	2706375	DMN wants to know, oh, I'm sorry, let's see.
2706796	2710318	What's the most fun thing and the most frustrating thing about doing Orange Lounge Radio?
2711701	2716202	The most fun thing is having my ego grow.
2717362	2719903	And the most frustrating thing is this room.
2721003	2721823	With the door shut.
2722824	2726744	It does get quite hot in here.
2728225	2728765	I don't know.
2731165	2732946	Just trying to stay on top of the news.
2733306	2734826	It's kind of tough during the week.
2735146	2738247	Remembering to update my show rules.
2739399	2742822	I would say the most fun thing about Orange Launch Radio... Oh, it's so much fun.
2743282	2751028	No, it's getting that instant feedback of having people, whether it be DarkSakura or Loki, right here in my ear, or having the chat room there.
2751128	2754790	I think having that feedback on your opinions is really great and kind of neat.
2755091	2758353	I don't know, it's just the reward I get from it is instant gratification.
2758393	2759974	You know, I'm a typical male.
2760615	2763637	The most frustrating thing about doing Orange Launch Radio is losing my Sunday nights.
2764609	2768611	You know, as much as I enjoy hanging out, but it's tough because it means you only really get a one-day weekend.
2768951	2770292	You know, so that's been frustrating.
2770352	2773214	But, I don't know, I guess you're just used to it after 200 weeks now, right?
2774074	2774834	That's how I feel.
2775055	2775335	Yeah.
2775355	2776135	You're just kind of used to it.
2776955	2783299	I have fully timed it, you know, how long I have to leave the South Bay now to get here.
2783519	2789262	Guys, since we have about at least 20 people who have submitted questions tonight, we can't get all your questions in, so we apologize.
2789622	2792864	The things that are a little too random and weird, we may not be able to get to tonight.
2792904	2793484	I apologize.
2794808	2798670	OL Army Eddie wants to know, where can I get all these cool songs you play?
2799130	2799851	The internet.
2800991	2802792	The internet is not just for porn.
2802812	2803232	iTunes.
2804973	2807154	If you ever want to know, try asking in chat.
2807434	2808955	Try emailing one of us.
2809615	2816379	The thing is that when you guys ask during the show, sometimes we're so busy operating the behind-the-scenes stuff that we can't answer questions right away.
2816779	2818700	But if you can come a few bars, we'll tell you.
2819460	2820361	You can always send us an email.
2820721	2822341	I'm more than fine with sharing song titles and things.
2822361	2822862	You can send me an email.
2823222	2823362	Yeah.
2825680	2829603	R Also, he wants to know, I guess I'll go ahead and entertain this question.
2829943	2831644	What would cause Sky to go straight?
2831824	2832945	Be graphic if needed.
2834145	2834846	Seeing my tits.
2835166	2835987	What was that, Chris?
2836747	2837588	Seeing my tits.
2838228	2839189	That might be a good start.
2839929	2845953	I would say one hot night with Gina Grishan or Beyonce.
2845993	2847234	I don't know why I love Beyonce.
2847254	2847954	She's so hot.
2848174	2848775	She's really hot.
2850035	2850616	No, I don't know.
2851076	2852577	Honestly, I'd
2853018	2855759	Boobs and Punaner just don't do it for me.
2855919	2856359	I'm sorry.
2856379	2861080	I'm sure you appreciate the aesthetic value of boobs.
2861200	2864441	I ask the women out there, do boobs and Punaner do it for you?
2865041	2871003	Well, I know this is probably not the best room to ask this question, but I'm asking the other women out there.
2871303	2872263	That's how I feel.
2872644	2877505	And guys out there, if you're a straight man, does penis do it for you?
2878462	2879802	Do you like the cock?
2879902	2882363	Yeah, that's how I feel about boobs and punaner.
2882543	2883263	Are you gay?
2883703	2885283	If you scream phone call, you gay.
2887344	2889704	Actdeft wants to know, can you speak Spanish?
2891605	2894045	Uno pequeño de español, si.
2895005	2896166	Unos zapatos aquí.
2897346	2903387	I had two years of Spanish, or dos años de español en colegio, but I'm not very good at it.
2903427	2904887	I only remember a few words here and there.
2905167	2906648	El teléfono es en fuego.
2909593	2915918	I took French and Japanese, so I can also say the TV is on fire.
2916598	2919000	Actdeft also wants to know, what's your opinion on Mexican zoning?
2919040	2919500	Pump it up.
2921181	2921782	Nothing wrong with that.
2922002	2922682	That's pretty hot.
2922762	2923943	More games for everyone.
2923983	2924583	That's a good thing.
2925364	2926164	No problems there.
2926505	2930227	Unless the country actually bought the game.
2930287	2931668	I don't know.
2933249	2937232	Blackwolf says, how can you type with boxing gloves on your hands?
2941049	2941289	What?
2941610	2943030	A very large keyboard.
2947793	2950294	God damn you people that bring Homestar Runner into this show.
2950554	2952355	No, I love Homestar Runner.
2952395	2954596	I can't complain, but you guys are funny.
2957157	2957837	Checking the PMs.
2957857	2958358	Checking the PMs.
2959358	2959998	Email!
2960178	2966521	DarkTetsuya wants to know, so what's it like going from reporting on hypodermic needles in Solo 2000 to the Nintendo Wii?
2966541	2967502	Nostalgia!
2968049	2968929	Wow, nostalgia.
2968949	2971370	That was one of our first beat-ups.
2971730	2973311	I remember calling that arcade.
2973911	2975532	I said, oh, you'll have to talk to our manager.
2975552	2976592	I remember that, too.
2977032	2978072	We were pretty cutting out.
2978092	2981414	That was when I was sleeping in the Harry Potter room in the gay frat house.
2982274	2982974	That was awesome.
2984094	2984635	Wow.
2984695	2991517	Yeah, we were... I remember doing the recording a podcast while... No, not even a podcast.
2991537	2994638	We were recording a live show while I was playing Beatmania.
2994738	2997439	And they were trying to talk to me like, I'm trying to play 321 Stars, damn it!
2998527	3002290	You know, it's just been crazy.
3002430	3005892	There's been a lot of... It's funny how games have changed in the past four years.
3006133	3008754	Because when we started doing this show, Max 2 was new in the arcades.
3009255	3011977	And then we went through Extreme, we went through a drought, now we're into Supernova.
3013718	3014579	Alright, more songs.
3015699	3017221	We want to get out of here before midnight tonight.
3017621	3020003	GS68 wants to know, do any of you play O2 Jam?
3020563	3025246	I tried it out about six months ago, and I had a pretty good time with it, I just haven't been back.
3025907	3027388	I don't do well with the game's
3030176	3030497	I don't know.
3031317	3034599	I'm just not good at checking in regularly with games like that for some reason.
3034979	3039462	I did play recently a game that somewhat reminded me of it, though, which was the R2-B, which was kind of fun.
3040103	3042004	I should check it out again and see what's changed there.
3042284	3043224	Has anyone else played O2 Jam?
3043965	3044065	No?
3044285	3044465	Yes?
3044605	3044705	No?
3045166	3047947	I looked at E3 and then walked on.
3048728	3048948	All right.
3050170	3050691	Let's see.
3052131	3056453	Nintendomaniac64 wants to know, Could I race Loki in Mario Kart DS?
3056513	3059655	I never got the chance and I've gone anti-snaking since nine months ago.
3061916	3063537	That sounds like a 12-step program.
3063557	3066438	I literally dusted off Mario Kart DS today.
3067339	3069920	I haven't played that game in months.
3070640	3070920	Alright.
3073362	3084564	Bandit wants to know, if train A is traveling at 50 miles per hour from Pittsburgh and train B is traveling at 35 miles per hour from California, which state will they meet in order to resupply the Orange Lounge Radio with more Chocobo Nuggets?
3085204	3085464	Wisconsin!
3086084	3087124	African or European?
3089105	3089765	African.
3092065	3096506	Nazgul Slayer wants to know, question, is there a Castro District ghetto?
3097326	3097626	Yes.
3098747	3100207	How about the whole place is ghetto?
3100227	3100267	No.
3101448	3104591	I actually feel safer there than just about any other place in San Francisco.
3104611	3107273	Yeah, actually, if you go around San Francisco, it's the safest place I feel.
3107293	3109615	Except for the homeless man who was laying with his cock out.
3110996	3119623	Around for your birthday, we found something in the window, and it's about that big around, and it's a penis, and we're going to catch you for your birthday.
3119703	3121905	I'm going to chase you around the house with it.
3122025	3124407	We also found you a codless bodysuit.
3125748	3126649	That's disgusting.
3128737	3132520	Ramma wants to know, you need to talk about the Spanish DDR movie.
3133941	3134801	Yeah, that's right.
3134841	3135982	I watched the trailer for that.
3136002	3137323	La Machina de Balar.
3138124	3139124	It actually looks kind of funny.
3139344	3141346	I want to see the actual movie before I talk about it.
3141366	3143007	You know, trailers can be deceiving, right?
3143327	3144128	The trailer looked funny.
3144408	3144668	All right.
3145068	3149571	Poto wants to know, Dear Orange Laundry, if you had to be a species of bird, extinct or not, which would you be?
3149591	3151372	Dodo.
3151412	3153414	The Dodo, I'm hearing Drew and Chris say.
3153434	3153794	What do you think?
3154401	3156361	I would be a... You'd be a fucking parrot.
3158262	3164923	I'd be a pterodactyl.
3165723	3166623	What is that bird?
3166904	3170384	It's not a parrot, it's another bird that lives as long as a human does.
3170404	3172005	Chicken?
3172065	3172885	No, not chicken.
3175345	3176926	I'd be Toucan Sam.
3178646	3183907	But I don't remember exactly what type of bird it is, but it's a bird that lives as long as a human and it's actually very intelligent.
3184742	3185282	No, not a vulture.
3185502	3186523	Ooh, I'd be a vulture.
3187243	3188924	No, I'd be a raven because I'm all goth.
3189484	3189965	Nevermore.
3190565	3191705	What about the Norwegian blue?
3191805	3192706	Lovely plumage.
3192886	3193946	Lovely plumage.
3194587	3194867	All right.
3194907	3196168	He's pining for the fjords.
3196648	3197808	He's not pining.
3197828	3200310	He's fast on.
3201010	3202591	This is an expert.
3204271	3206252	Let's go to the next question here.
3206673	3209434	Socorina wants to know, do you guys have VJ Army accounts?
3209474	3210815	And if so, what's your DJ name?
3211675	3213856	I do have one and I haven't ever updated it.
3214790	3215510	8th 8th Loki
3241226	3241647	I don't know.
3241667	3243008	I don't play 2DX really.
3243028	3243568	Oh yeah, that's right.
3243588	3244449	You hate 2DX.
3244469	3245069	I don't hate it.
3245089	3245950	I just don't play it.
3247151	3250773	Legend of Zaku wants to know, do you guys have any video game inspired drink recipes?
3251153	3251434	Ooh.
3252214	3252454	No.
3252815	3254056	Any what inspired drink recipes?
3254076	3255817	Video game inspired drink recipes.
3255917	3257978	Like mixed drinks that are inspired by video games.
3259599	3260840	Burning Heat featuring Hot Damn?
3260860	3261121	Burning Heat.
3261141	3261601	Featuring Hot Damn?
3261861	3262562	That's a good idea.
3262582	3265344	Okay, I'm going to make up one right now.
3265744	3266004	Okay.
3267785	3267945	It's...
3271039	3276423	Goldschlager and Midori Goldschlager and Midori, remember that one?
3276483	3278185	Goldschlager and Midori
3300114	3302676	and it's made with Goldschlager and Jägermeister.
3303858	3305879	Two of the nasty and cheap tequila.
3306640	3308882	And when you puke, that's the game.
3308902	3311364	Because that's what Abydox look like.
3311545	3312886	All right, look.
3313046	3314287	Just a couple more quick questions.
3314848	3316189	We're not going to get to all the questions tonight.
3316229	3318271	I apologize, guys.
3319732	3320653	I love Abydox.
3320773	3323175	Duckator wants to know, do coconuts migrate?
3323596	3324777	Yes.
3326000	3330864	Coconut is a non-migratory as it would be carried by an African swallow or European swallow.
3331584	3336868	You know what's funny is once I went to the grocery store, my old roommate and I were in college and we just bought a coconut because we just wanted to play with it.
3337128	3341731	Like, we wanted to see if we could open it using household tools because we didn't know.
3341811	3343252	Like, you only see on TV.
3343493	3345454	You were just interested in having a hairy ball.
3345734	3346515	Oh, go to hell.
3347515	3348596	Just fucking go to hell.
3349537	3349837	All right.
3352351	3353091	Oh, no, two more questions.
3353211	3356974	SSJ100Matt wants to know, ask Loki when he will do another Loki Fusion.
3358075	3359336	I haven't done one in a while.
3359376	3363659	I keep toying with it, and it's just, it's like writer's block, you know.
3364080	3366942	For those that don't know Loki Fusion, you have your own DDR remix songs, right?
3367242	3367482	Yeah.
3367662	3371806	And they're on, what, MySpace.com slash Loki Fusion?
3372026	3372386	Yeah.
3372726	3374468	All right.
3376229	3377290	All right, last question.
3377330	3378871	I think this is a great question to end on.
3380055	3381456	This is a serious one, okay?
3381656	3383738	You may have to think about this one for a minute, but everybody's got to answer.
3384618	3385799	At least the host, the three of us do.
3386539	3391643	If you could go back to the beginning prior to the show starting... This came from Solar Wing, by the way.
3391663	3392243	I don't know if I said that.
3392263	3397606	If you could go back to the beginning prior to the show starting, would you do it again or do it differently?
3401829	3402469	This is a tough one.
3402489	3402529	Um...
3404608	3409849	I would have said we should have had Loki on since episode one as a full-blown co-host because we just didn't know him well enough then.
3409889	3411610	But he wasn't a true co-host until episode 20.
3411650	3412410	A lot of people don't know that.
3412730	3417371	But he wasn't truly a recognized co-host of the show until... He was kind of like a Drew.
3417391	3418492	He just showed up all the fucking time.
3419072	3421533	But yeah, he got promoted to co-host in episode 20.
3421593	3423433	I would have said we would have had Loki on board episode one.
3426794	3427174	I don't know.
3427194	3428114	I know what I would do different.
3428214	3428374	What?
3428495	3431095	Not use that retarded headset because I had a migraine the whole episode.
3432256	3432516	Loki?
3433576	3433596	I...
3434446	3436788	This doesn't really have anything to do with Orange Lounge, though.
3437369	3438870	I wouldn't have built the cabinet!
3442032	3443013	I know, you spent so much.
3443033	3445755	And I threw it away, like a baby.
3446536	3448277	Aborted and thrown in the dumpster.
3448938	3451059	I don't think there's anything else.
3451280	3453581	It's hard, because, you know, we've just learned so many things.
3453601	3455103	No, I still have those DDR pads.
3455703	3459026	I think I would have tried harder in the beginning to really...
3459841	3467004	Believe that what we were doing was not just something we were fucking around online, but it was really generally something people wanted to listen to, and I think I would have tried to promote us better in the beginning.
3467224	3468864	Or more general gaming, maybe?
3469364	3471245	I think in retrospect, I don't know, though.
3471325	3474106	You know, we owe the Bomani scene a lot.
3474246	3479268	I think, honestly, though, I would have made the shift to general gaming about a year sooner than we did.
3479288	3483490	We should have done podcasting, because we would have beat everybody to it by like two years.
3483730	3483950	Yeah.
3484970	3486691	We should have invented podcasting, yeah.
3486711	3487371	Podcasting?
3489107	3489627	DarkSakura.com
3517170	3520352	I do not regret a single second of it because that makes us what we are right now.
3520812	3522212	SSJ100 Matt brings up a good point.
3522273	3524233	We were one of the first shows to introduce Skype calls.
3524354	3530937	People don't recognize that, but we were probably like, if not, I would almost challenge, we were the first internet radio show to do Skype calls.
3531157	3532918	I would challenge that.
3533118	3534819	Find me a show that was doing it before we were.
3535719	3537980	Because we got on board with that Skype thing really early.
3538520	3538981	Don't you think?
3539101	3540942	Because we were doing it before we were even podcasting.
3542222	3543683	Yeah, when Skype was in beta, we were doing it.
3544113	3546305	Actually, I think my Skype is still the beta version.
3550394	3554917	I'm not trying to sound egotistical, but I like to think of the fact that we've been on the cutting edge of a few things.
3554997	3559899	The PSP web browser, granted we haven't done too much with that.
3560319	3570864	Although I think we do a great show here, I think we owe the fact that we were one of the first gaming podcasts with an already established fan base thanks to our live show is the reason why we won the podcast award last year.
3571425	3574206	I also think that we're not afraid to go there.
3575747	3580510	That's one thing that we've always tried to hold on to is we don't really censor ourselves.
3581311	3582332	We give it as it is.
3582672	3584814	If we get an explicit tag one week, fuck it.
3585935	3586555	Very good point.
3586995	3587516	Very good point.
3587876	3588236	Fuck it.
3588837	3589237	Yeah.
3589297	3589858	Right in the ear.
3589998	3591239	Fuck the fucking fuckers.
3591699	3592099	All right.
3592580	3600946	On that note, I wanted to go around and see if anyone had any speeches, things they wanted to say to close out the show tonight.
3602127	3603008	I just want to say I'll start.
3605057	3610841	It's been a really interesting 200 episodes and I've learned a lot.
3611521	3617965	And I've received such wonderful compliments from you guys out there on the internet.
3618005	3622888	And it makes me feel so good because, you know, when I was in college, I did not know what the hell I wanted to do with my life.
3622948	3630693	And I was starting in, I was doing media arts for a while, meaning I was going to go into television and radio.
3631053	3633435	But I was just convinced I was not cut out for radio.
3633871	3638854	because I was not going to blow my way to the top, which is what most people do in the radio industry.
3638914	3643456	A lot of people that you hear on the afternoon drive probably fuck someone to get there.
3643536	3644777	And I wasn't down with that.
3644877	3652300	I wanted to do something, you know, I didn't, that's when I knew I did not really want to play with the big boys and work that way, that I wanted to kind of do my own thing.
3652360	3657423	So I really appreciate Travis kind of noticing that first on Interstation Live and kind of
3658477	3671485	Joining me to be – or asking me to be a part of his show to kind of bring that out of me a little bit, which enabled me to get the idea going here with DarkSakura, who I think felt very enabled by that program as well, to kind of come do our own thing here on Orange Lounge Radio.
3671505	3672826	And it's been a fantastic experience.
3673166	3684413	And to have come now to this point where we are working with a guy who started a television network about gaming is just –
3685635	3687356	That's the path I wanted to take.
3687517	3688117	You know what I mean?
3688297	3690119	I didn't want to blow my way to the top.
3690179	3694322	I wanted to work through the back door like a typical gay man.
3695063	3695723	And I'm very happy.
3695924	3698626	And DarkSakura and Loki, you guys are awesome.
3698666	3703230	Loki, I really wish we would have had you on episode one because we didn't know you.
3703270	3705772	Despite what you say, we didn't really know you.
3706252	3707913	But it's been awesome.
3707953	3709575	And when we lived together, we had a great time.
3709615	3712397	And I don't think we ever fought once, which made you a really great roommate.
3712437	3712577	So...
3714045	3714985	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3742651	3743491	Oh god, I just love you.
3743772	3744492	I think you're so smart.
3746173	3746913	Well, that's the point.
3747293	3751175	So, thank you for everything.
3751495	3757958	And don't ever let internet fanboy people who are pissed off that some girl likes to yell at them once in a while ever get under your skin.
3758218	3760399	Because I know it was hard at first when we first went podcasting.
3760699	3761899	But they suck.
3765896	3768658	I can't say anything right now because I'm emo.
3768879	3770040	Loki, do you want to say anything?
3770480	3771641	I don't know what the hell to say.
3771661	3773122	I'm not good at this stuff.
3773483	3775284	No, it's been fun.
3775624	3776946	I like doing the show.
3777346	3782650	It's just, you know, Nellie doesn't probably like too much that I spend three hours of my week every week.
3783271	3788776	Well, mentally, probably way too much time on the show.
3788896	3791178	I mean, my God, like,
3791823	3792643	Do stuff at work.
3792683	3793803	It's all game related.
3793944	3795104	It's always game related.
3795424	3796924	Everything's always game related with me.
3797384	3798145	Get a life, Loki.
3800025	3802946	Seriously, I think getting married would change everything.
3803966	3806627	No, it doesn't.
3806647	3812808	The only thing I'm focusing on now is taking the show to the next step.
3812908	3813328	Not letting the
3817304	3823848	Other big sites out there bother you with the fact that people take them more seriously and that kind of stuff.
3823868	3828691	Because you either have to have a big financial backing or you just got to earn the respect for it.
3828751	3832774	So all that comes in time and money.
3833554	3834555	So I don't know.
3834735	3835936	It's just going to be interesting.
3836056	3837877	I have no plans on quitting the show.
3837937	3840158	So however long it goes.
3843520	3843800	Okay.
3844561	3844741	Okay.
3845838	3846919	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3873001	3874201	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3903504	3914787	Because there's still this vast majority of, and no offense to any of our guys listening, there's still this vast majority of men out there who think that just because they have a cock, they can tell women what to do.
3914887	3923709	Well, I think G4 fucked a lot of that for everybody, for girls everywhere, because a lot of girl gamers on that, girl gamers, quote unquote, are just a set of tits.
3924309	3926910	And Dark Sakura is so much more than just a nice set of tits.
3927170	3928690	Although they are nice.
3929090	3930350	They are nice tits, don't get me wrong.
3930950	3932971	But there's just much more than that.
3933607	3948357	But, you know, it actually gave, doing this show just from, even from getting on Under Sedation because it was you and Jessica, you know, Rob and Jessica.
3948578	3950139	Speaking of a nice set of tits.
3950359	3951700	Yeah.
3951880	3952760	She was wonderful too.
3952801	3956783	I have to say thank you to Jessica because, I'll go back to that in a minute.
3956803	3957023	Go ahead.
3957144	3960386	But you guys brought me in on Under Sedation and I had been just sort of,
3961785	3969988	You know, I've always been outspoken in front of people, but very nervous in large groups, you know, and I really got me over a lot of my, my shyness.
3970148	3983913	I think that my residual shyness gave me a lot more ability or I say confidence to really say, you know, tact is one thing, but censoring yourself for the sake of
3984443	3993407	You know, censoring the truth, I think, or how you really feel for the sake of political correctness or somebody else's retarded sensitivities.
3994467	4009934	Doing the show has completely opened up that side of me that has given me courage to stand up for myself as a woman, not just to the gaming community, but at work, you know, in my daily life, you know.
4010923	4016706	I feel completely... I mean, doing this show has been such a confidence booster.
4017566	4027791	And I thank everybody who has supported my loudmouth, outspoken, bitchy, Aries womanliness.
4028891	4029912	I want to thank all of you.
4031592	4034494	And whoever's king my Lancer needs to die right now.
4036415	4036895	Amazing.
4037375	4037735	Wow.
4037975	4038976	Thank you guys so much.
4041905	4044767	Yes, Drew, and Chris, if you guys want to add anything.
4044887	4045408	You don't have to.
4046689	4048530	Shit, guys, it's been a wild ride.
4048550	4050431	I mean, I've been with you guys since Episode 2.
4051112	4053153	We jumped the shark in Episode 1, apparently.
4054294	4058537	But I've been here for the whole downhill ride, and I was listening when I was 16.
4058597	4062240	It's kind of funny that this show sort of defined...
4062987	4092073	my adult social life I grew up with this show and it's kind of sad and it's kind of cool at the same time because for the past few years this show has been the main constant and I go from awkward teen to intern to scapegoat to bad joke master and you know what I'm still here the show is still going strong and I hope we continue this course for a long time to come
4094278	4098180	This is the best thing on the internet right now, at least my opinion.
4120163	4123945	Jessica and I couldn't fucking stand each other the last year that we did Under Sedation Live.
4124726	4126227	And it's cool, we're cool now.
4126347	4128328	I mean, so, you know, it's okay that I say that.
4128348	4130629	I couldn't say that a couple years ago, but I can say it now.
4130989	4132630	Jessica and I could not fucking stand each other.
4132650	4134712	I mean, it was really hard to do that program.
4135192	4141936	So, I know from experience that being such good friends with you guys is...
4143052	4143773	Such a relief.
4143953	4146055	It makes doing this show so much easier.
4146475	4152520	And I truly do look forward to having this show every week as being a way that we can hang out with each other.
4152560	4155503	Because sometimes our lives are so busy, we can't do it without this constant.
4156104	4161288	I do have to say, though, just to yours and Jessica's credit, you both hit it very well on there.
4161989	4162849	That's professionalism.
4162869	4169095	When I saw Chicago, the end of that movie, and if anybody wants to know exactly what it was like,
4169554	4170194	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4184602	4190807	I just remember listening to that episode and sitting at my computer about to bawl because you know what my position was in between that.
4190847	4192348	Chris, did you want to say anything?
4192448	4192549	No.
4210425	4211726	I don't know how much I can contribute.
4211786	4213947	I'm kind of a new listener.
4216568	4218409	I'm a noob.
4220311	4224553	I actually met you, Rob, the first time when we saw Silent Hill.
4225310	4230053	That was the first time I met you, and I listened to a podcast right before that.
4231034	4235197	And I've never really been into video games.
4235257	4244023	I mean, I like video games, but I'm one of those people that is really interested in something, but has absolutely no idea what you guys are talking about.
4244583	4248086	So it's been very educational listening to you guys, and I just like...
4250851	4251472	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4279429	4281211	I am normal, average.
4282212	4282892	Thank you, Rob, though.
4283693	4285775	Shut up, Rob.
4285795	4287417	We have one more person that has a speech.
4287617	4290780	Okay.
4290900	4296065	Black Wolf in our chat room says, and you know, guesting on OLR was a highlight of my podcasting career.
4297335	4298275	You sappy bitch.
4298355	4301256	You've got a great podcast.
4302296	4306097	He's hit 50 himself, and he's done Dragon Con.
4306117	4307957	I mean, he's done cons bigger than we have.
4308637	4309438	Don't get sappy.
4309738	4312898	I don't know if it's the champagne, but I do feel a little weepy.
4312978	4313839	Do you have another glass?
4314059	4314379	All right.
4314999	4315599	All right, look.
4316639	4317199	Here's the thing.
4317259	4324621	Let's turn this show around and start to end this thing on a positive note, because for a long...
4326983	4330885	We actually are going to be ending on a bit of a high note, but I ain't singing it.
4331725	4332325	Here's the deal.
4333005	4344069	There's been a moment in Orange Lounge Radio's history that people, for whatever reason, just seem to love and have never shut up about since the night it happened.
4344109	4345509	The night it happened was November 16, 2003.
4346550	4351011	And I think it went down in a lot of people's minds.
4351776	4353237	in Orange Lounge Radio's history.
4353257	4353977	And here's the weird thing.
4354017	4356159	Jamie wasn't even there that night when this happened.
4356279	4358720	I was staying in the Harry Potter room in the gay front house.
4358820	4367065	And folks have been begging and begging to please post this somewhere so I can download it.
4367405	4368006	No!
4369066	4372769	So here it is, boys and girls, on this special 200th podcast.
4373489	4376931	A little clip from episode 69 of Orange Lounge Radio.
4377511	4379973	Loki Plays Karaoke Revolution.
4383537	4387612	Wait, I just have to say, the sound quality sucks because we were on dial-up back then, okay?
4387673	4388677	So, just bear with us.
4393447	4402011	Hiho, Kermit the E-Fog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.
4402051	4412975	Alright, we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and as promised, we're now going to show off our karaoke talents in a round of Karaoke Revolution.
4413315	4415296	Say it again.
4416237	4418057	Um... Dream...

4506010	4531540	Just don't understand I've got it all in hand Oh how I've got it planned I'm spreading the love There's more for me to fear And I just feel so good Every time I hear I'm singing I'm happy with the females Gotta let it show I'm actually causing this song
4532347	4536908	That's pretty amazing, I think, since I can't sing worth a shit.
4540689	4542529	Oh yeah, play the instrumental solo.
4543109	4545069	Oh yeah, oh yeah.
4545109	4546770	Yeah, work in the crowd!
4546910	4548830	Yeah, yeah.

4591153	4592234	I'm staying in.
4593775	4595217	I'm sick of this song.
4595497	4597399	You're going to really die.
4599480	4600902	God, this is long.
4601482	4603764	It just doesn't fucking end.
4603784	4605766	It just keeps on going on.
4608388	4610770	I'm going to kill anyone in the chat room that has a recording of this.
4610970	4612051	You're going to so die.
4612572	4613613	I know where you live.
4614654	4617736	As a reminder, the show will be broadcast this week on Thursday.
4621055	4628010	A score of 6,964 points for Loki Not even a gold record There is no justice in this world Okay
4629418	4631399	Alright, we're going to shut the game off now.
4631479	4633499	Oh my god, I have not laughed that hard.
4633519	4635360	I laughed so hard my head scared.
4635380	4637141	I laughed so hard I peed, okay?
4637161	4638581	I peed a little.
4639381	4640442	I peed a little bit.
4641582	4643243	I got to hear this when I came back.
4643563	4644583	You weren't even there that week.
4645163	4648184	The girl in there was our original show to a madam's name.
4648324	4649405	Yeah.
4649745	4651325	She needs to come back and be on the show soon.
4651525	4651865	Loki?
4656227	4656467	Well...
4657330	4658210	We'll put them up.
4658390	4662812	God, our show sounded like shit back then, didn't it?
4664232	4664572	You know what?
4664612	4667873	We should have never been a dialogue-friendly station.
4668474	4674275	Well, I have both recordings already edited out.
4674295	4677437	I'm not sure if they were recorded on my computer at the time.
4677457	4678657	I think they were edited out of the show.
4678877	4679757	Loki's going to kill me.
4679797	4680898	I have the deep, dark secret.
4681838	4683318	I was the one who distributed that.
4684359	4684719	Whatever.
4684739	4685119	I don't care.
4685731	4691615	Here's the thing, episode 300 we have is complicated, but until then... No, now listen.
4692956	4701381	Here's what we'll do, because the MP3s on the MySpace page have been getting kind of stale, so we'll put both of them up.
4701521	4703082	Alright, we'll see what we can do.
4704183	4705484	I thought you sounded okay.
4706825	4708166	You should have heard complicated.
4709527	4713369	They made me pick a random song, so it was just like... Avril Lavigne's complicated?
4713849	4714630	Now that's sexy.
4715931	4716512	All right, guys.
4716612	4718913	I really, I do not like karaoke revolution.
4719073	4728501	We will be back here next week, as always, Sunday night, September 24th, 2006, with Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 201.
4729281	4730702	Same old shit, different week.
4731683	4733825	DDR sneak peeks continue next week.
4733885	4737567	Hoping to have an interview next week with a very interesting independent product.
4737587	4739909	I'm looking forward to getting more on that.
4740270	4740750	But for now...
4741667	4743488	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
4744208	4746590	Drew, Drew Nami, thanks so much for being here again this week.
4746610	4747290	What's your final thought?
4747730	4749932	Be excellent to each other.
4750972	4752073	Chris, what's your final thought?
4752113	4753013	Party on, dudes!
4753454	4754414	Chris, your final thought?
4757296	4758377	I have no final thought.
4758437	4759297	My brain is dead.
4759377	4761198	But happy 200, guys.
4761338	4761678	Thank you.
4761959	4762499	It's awesome.
4762559	4765641	And enjoy your fat-causing product of chocolate.
4768602	4771284	My final thought is peanut butter.
4772288	4789895	I think the living room was inspired by us.
4789915	4791736	They're playing Comcast Karaoke right now.
4791776	4792776	They were playing that before.
4793436	4798018	No, but you might see another show come back.
4798538	4798818	Maybe.
4798998	4800199	I'm not going to make any promises.
4801172	4802593	DarkSakura, your final thought?
4802793	4804714	I have to always say reject false icons.
4805015	4805855	It is episode 200.
4805895	4808937	Toto says fuckfutter.
4809357	4809938	Buckfutter.
4810998	4814861	I read that and I was thinking of that Chibamato song, Butterfucker.
4816662	4818083	I was singing that in my car.
4820905	4827830	But I'm full of emotional happy right now and cake.
4827930	4829010	Oh, stop taking my foot!
4829531	4829691	What?
