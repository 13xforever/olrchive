0	6000	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
6000	15000	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15000	20000	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20000	26000	And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this very special Part C to celebrate our 200th episode.
26000	32000	Now I want to warn you guys, if this is your first time downloading Orange Lounge Radio, this is going to be a little bit different.
32000	35000	This is not your typical segment of Orange Lounge Radio.
35000	40000	So I urge you to check out orangeloungeradio.com and dip back in our podcast feed and check out Parts A and B.
40000	44000	We envision this section of the show to be a little more like our afterbirth segment.
44000	46000	For those that listen live, you know what that is.
46000	48000	It's a little bonus thing we do just for the live listeners.
48000	50000	We do have a little bit more game news.
50000	55000	We just filled up with stuff in Part B and just had a little more we wanted to talk about here in Part C.
55000	61000	But first, before we get to that gaming news, what we did is we brought in a little bit of champagne.
61000	64000	I promise there will be liquor tonight in one form or another.
64000	67000	We're going to do a toast here to our 200th episode.
67000	70000	Does anyone want to make the toast or should I just do it or what?
70000	71000	Anyone want to say a little bit?
71000	72000	Alright.
72000	79000	I would say it's been a wonderful 200 episodes with you all and we're going to keep doing this as long as we possibly can.
79000	82000	Hopefully another 200 episodes in the future.
82000	85000	Loki, anything you want to say?
85000	86000	I can't reach.
86000	87000	Alright.
87000	88000	Dr. Sakura?
88000	90000	To quote, this is the thing I always toast.
90000	91000	Here's to us.
91000	92000	Who's like us?
92000	93000	Damn few.
93000	95000	And they're all dead.
95000	96000	Toast, toast.
96000	97000	Yay.
97000	98000	Clean.
98000	102000	You can't hear the cleans because they're plastic.
102000	103000	That's some good Corbel.
103000	104000	Alright.
104000	108000	You're not a big champagne fan?
108000	109000	I hate champagne.
109000	112000	I like champagne but I really like it and a good mimosa.
112000	115000	Why can't we just toast Guinness?
115000	116000	Okay.
116000	118000	When we reach 300, we toast Guinness.
118000	120000	Or 250 is a big number too.
120000	121000	I don't know.
121000	125000	I think it's going to be more like the fifth birthday because fifth birthday is pretty big so we'll see.
125000	129000	Anyway, Jamie already burped the Corbel.
129000	130000	That's amazing.
130000	131000	That's some fizzy stuff.
131000	132000	That is amazing.
132000	133000	Alright.
133000	136000	We have a little bit of extra stories here for you guys.
136000	137000	Loki?
137000	138000	Yes.
138000	140000	A lot of fun stuff for part C.
140000	144000	Anyways, I really shouldn't be paying attention.
144000	146000	Thank you Chat Room for your well wishes by the way.
146000	151000	So, there's been a lot of rumors going around about the 360.
151000	159000	One that keeps popping back up is Microsoft's going to release a brand new 360 with an internal HD DVD drive.
159000	162000	Once again, they have said no.
162000	166000	We are not releasing a SKU with an HD DVD drive.
166000	173000	It says, it turns out you want to say in how you spend your entertainment dollars.
173000	180000	So, who are we to burden every customer with the cost of expensive movie technology?
180000	185000	Ooh, sub Sony.
185000	187000	Ouch.
187000	190000	That was Bill Gates whipping it out right there.
190000	194000	No, that was actually a generic Microsoft employees.
194000	197000	Sorry, that was a Microsoft employee whipping out their cock.
197000	199000	No, that was one of their technical writers.
199000	200000	I see.
200000	203000	This is why I'm in school to be a tech writer.
203000	204000	Alright.
204000	210000	So that I too can whip out the corporate cock.
210000	211000	I don't need a corporate cock.
211000	213000	I just need a cock.
213000	214000	Your girlfriend is still bigger.
214000	220000	Anyway.
220000	234000	There is actually the Game U College Tour will be making the rounds.
234000	238000	It will be featuring the Xbox 360, Xbox and PC gaming.
238000	245000	The tour will last three months and it will hit up 40 different college campuses.
245000	253000	It's produced by Game Informer, Norcent TV and Mountain Dew and a bunch of other folks.
253000	259000	And it's going to hopefully reach 90,000 different people.
259000	264000	Some of the titles that are included are Madden NFL 07, blah, blah, blah.
264000	271000	Rainbow Six, Saints Row, Mortal Combat Armageddon, America's Army Special Forces,
271000	276000	Splitter's Little Agent, blah, blah, blah, Project Gotham 3, Dead Rising.
276000	278000	In other words, all the games Jamie does not enjoy playing.
278000	279000	Hey, Dead Rising.
279000	280000	Okay, that's cool.
280000	283000	Dead Rising was hot.
283000	292000	And there will be a Madden NFL 07 football field goal competition and the winners take home $1,000 as the prize.
292000	298000	And Game Informer will have a Halo 2 competition each place with an unnamed prize it seems.
298000	306000	So the tour starts on September 14th at the University of Arizona in Tucson.
306000	311000	Other schools that will be visited will be just general places.
311000	318000	They will be going to Austin, Texas, University of Texas, University of Missouri, Wichita State.
318000	328000	Vanderbilt, Northern Kentucky, Temple University, Penn State.
328000	338000	They will be going to State University of New York in Buffalo and Miami University of Ohio.
338000	339000	That always makes me laugh.
339000	343000	And of course Notre Dame in Indiana.
343000	344000	All right.
344000	349000	Well, if the game isn't coming to you, maybe you need to bring the game with you everywhere you go.
349000	351000	Now you know those little plug and play things, right?
351000	353000	The little joysticks you can plug into your TV.
353000	355000	You see them sell these at Target all the time, right?
355000	358000	Well, these things are getting smaller and smaller and now check this out.
358000	361000	They now have key chain plug and plays.
361000	369000	A little teeny Atari joystick and a little teeny Atari paddle that you can take with you to play games on the go.
369000	371000	They have actual games in these.
371000	374000	It's an included six foot cable that comes with it.
374000	377000	It's on a battery powered reel and you put it on the key chain here.
377000	380000	Then you can plug it in and play.
380000	385000	There's one joystick that will have Asteroids and Millipede, another with Centipede and Yars Revenge,
385000	389000	and then the paddle will have Pong, Breakout, and Warlords.
389000	391000	That's crazy.
391000	396000	The key chain comes with a separate pocket sized reel that holds six feet of cords and RCA jacks.
396000	402000	It's powered by three AAA batteries, single player only, however, since it is just a little key chain.
402000	403000	That's crazy.
403000	406000	I wonder what the original Atari programmers think of these.
406000	408000	I know, I've got to wonder.
408000	410000	That's the next Classic Gaming Expo that they do.
410000	413000	They skipped here for Classic Gaming Expo so they could do the 10th anniversary.
413000	414000	Right.
414000	418000	I'm definitely going and I'm going to ask them what they think of that because that's just crazy.
418000	426000	GS68 says, I'm left handed, I demand a lefty stick or I will refuse to buy Atari 2600 related crap.
426000	430000	Dark Tetsuya in our chat says, shame the paddle won't link up with three others.
430000	432000	So, sad.
432000	437000	Okay, well, what we're going to do now, I think that was about all the gaming news we have.
437000	440000	We'll get some last minute stories in a minute if any folks have stuff.
440000	441000	Well, first, we have these.
441000	444000	I wanted to play these since we are celebrating our 200th episode.
444000	448000	We got sent a surprise from All Games, our buddies at All Games.
448000	452000	So, I was going to go ahead and play this so we could hear this.
455000	457000	Hey Crop, did you hear the news?
457000	458000	What news?
458000	462000	Orange Lounge Radio is doing their 200th episode this week.
462000	463000	What?
463000	464000	Yeah.
464000	465000	Two hundred?
465000	466000	Yeah.
467000	469000	Nice dedication for you.
469000	470000	Yeah, it is.
470000	471000	Two hundred shows.
471000	472000	Two hundred.
472000	473000	That's a lot.
473000	474000	Yeah?
474000	475000	Yeah, it is.
475000	479000	You think you'll ever reach that level of dedication?
479000	482000	Well, my contract is only for thirty.
482000	485000	You have a contract?
485000	486000	Oops.
491000	497000	Hey there, this is Scott from All Games Interactive wishing the guys and girls at Orange Lounge Radio
497000	499000	a happy 200th episode.
499000	503000	Sky, Dark Sacra, and Loki, you guys kick ass.
503000	509000	In fact, to celebrate, we are going to spend the next four days playing DDR and listening to DDR music.
509000	517000	So, from everyone here at the Arena Lounge, on 200 episodes, you guys rock.
523000	527000	Do you realize how cool it would be if I could actually play V and have it sound like this?
527000	531000	Oh, anyway, Bobby Blackwolf here from that show that comes on before you guys.
531000	532000	200, eh?
532000	535000	Y'all cheated, counting all those years of internet radio and all.
535000	539000	But don't worry, Scott's funky episode numbering will catch up in about a month.
539000	544000	But seriously, y'all were one of the reasons I started podcasting and I enjoy you guys each week.
544000	549000	Good luck to all of you in the future, and make sure it doesn't go downhill from here.
551000	552000	Someone had to say it.
552000	556000	That was wonderful.
556000	558000	That was so cute.
558000	560000	That was so cute. I don't know what else to say.
560000	563000	Just the thing that had me cracking was, you had a contract?
563000	566000	That was Kopackin and Hendrix from the show Between Us.
566000	570000	You know, who are all those people at Arena yelling in the background there?
570000	572000	That was kind of interesting.
572000	573000	They hired people.
573000	575000	Yeah, they must have hired stand-ins to do that.
575000	578000	Hey Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
578000	579000	What?
579000	580000	I want my second glass of champagne.
580000	582000	Good for you.
582000	584000	Did you want my glass?
584000	586000	That was unintentional.
586000	589000	Did you want my glass of champagne? Because I don't want it.
589000	591000	Let me finish this one first.
591000	593000	That's what I did at your wedding.
593000	596000	No, that's what I did at your wedding.
596000	600000	Yeah, I want to see if Scott really does play for a day's worth of DDR.
600000	603000	Because, you know, Scott's full of shit sometimes.
603000	608000	I wonder if he's really going to do four days of DDR.
608000	610000	I cannot picture him playing DDR.
610000	613000	But if they do, is Black Boy still listening?
613000	614000	Oh no, I don't think he is.
614000	616000	Somebody videotape it over at Arena Lounge.
616000	620000	God damn it, that Rob shit in the chat room needs to stop right now.
620000	624000	They are just flooding our chat.
624000	627000	You haven't done that since like what, episode one?
627000	628000	I think so.
628000	629000	All right.
629000	631000	Well, All Games, we love those guys.
631000	633000	And thank you guys so much for getting in on that and putting that together for us.
633000	634000	That was awesome.
634000	638000	Our fans also decided to ambush our voicemail line this week.
638000	639000	I know we have fans.
639000	640000	That's what I said too.
640000	643000	Well, we had some voicemails hit our voicemail line this week.
643000	644000	So we're going to play that as well.
644000	647000	Hello, Orange Land Radio.
647000	650000	Happy 200th episode.
650000	651000	Thank you.
651000	653000	I love you guys.
653000	655000	You're a lover.
655000	658000	No, it's not Japanese hard time for it.
658000	659000	Really?
659000	661000	Thank you.
661000	663000	Oh, I heart you.
663000	664000	Let's hit three.
664000	665000	Hi, Orange Land Radio.
665000	666000	This is Christian Cream.
666000	668000	Congratulations on episode 200.
668000	669000	I'm with you all the way.
669000	670000	Thanks.
670000	671000	Have a good show.
671000	672000	I'm going to be looking for my stuff.
672000	673000	Yay, Orange Land Radio.
673000	674000	Whoo!
674000	677000	Hello, Sky, Loki, and Dark Sakura.
677000	678000	This is DMX.
678000	683000	I'm calling to congratulate you guys on your 200th episode.
683000	685000	I don't know many podcasts at all.
685000	686000	I'll be honest.
686000	689000	But you guys have been around for a while.
689000	690000	I've heard about you for a while.
690000	694000	I just started being a part of the station in a bigger way.
694000	695000	And I love you guys.
695000	696000	Keep up the good work.
696000	698000	Here's to another 200.
698000	699000	You guys all take care.
699000	700000	Let's hit three.
700000	703000	This is MPV operator 6160 with a message.
703000	705000	Hello, Orange Land Radio.
705000	708000	And congratulations on your 200th episode.
708000	710000	Hope for many more in the future.
710000	711000	Pooh, you're out.
711000	712000	Hey, it's Misty.
712000	714000	And I'm pretty sure that I'm going
714000	715000	to be listening tonight anyway.
715000	719000	But I just wanted to say, in a more personal way,
719000	721000	congrats on reaching episode 200.
721000	722000	Bye.
725000	726000	Wow.
726000	727000	That was really sweet, you guys.
727000	728000	Thank you very much.
731000	731000	I know.
731000	732000	I like the guy.
732000	734000	I think it was Yuri Lever who sounded like he was talking.
734000	737000	And he had just had this.
737000	738000	Oh, god.
738000	738000	Red versus blue.
738000	739000	Who is that?
739000	740000	Camus.
740000	741000	Camus.
741000	743000	He sounded like Camus.
743000	745000	I have to go to the bathroom now.
745000	746000	I have the microphone to the phone.
746000	748000	And you tell everybody what you just told me.
748000	751000	Uh-oh.
751000	752000	Dan?
752000	753000	What?
753000	754000	What did he say?
754000	755000	Tell us what you just told me.
755000	756000	Are you getting it?
756000	757000	All right.
757000	758000	On the count of three.
758000	759000	One, two, three.
759000	760000	Congratulations.
760000	761000	We can't hear it.
761000	762000	We can't hear it.
762000	763000	What's he saying?
763000	764000	Just tell us what he's saying.
764000	766000	From everybody here, Pat Bucher.
766000	767000	Do you have speakerphone on that?
767000	768000	No.
768000	769000	I do have speakerphone.
769000	770000	Oh, yeah.
770000	771000	Put it on speakerphone.
771000	772000	One second.
772000	773000	We warned you guys it would be random.
773000	774000	OK.
774000	775000	Is that it?
775000	776000	Is this your husband?
776000	777000	This is Dan.
777000	778000	OK.
778000	779000	Say it again.
779000	780000	Uh, congratulations on your 200th episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
780000	781000	Man, I didn't think you'd make it to, you know, two.
781000	794000	We didn't think we'd make it to two either.
794000	795000	Wow.
795000	797520	That was nice.
797520	798520	Everybody's getting in on the love.
798520	799520	You're still on speakerphone.
799520	802520	You're still there.
802520	803520	Close the damn phone.
803520	804520	We've got other stuff to get to.
804520	807520	Don't wait.
807520	808520	Bye, sweetie.
808520	809520	All right.
809520	810520	Dork.
810520	811520	Yes.
811520	813440	I'm saying this on the radio.
813440	820640	My husband is a dork, but he brings me pinballs, so that's why I keep them around.
820640	821640	This is great radio.
821640	822640	You know what?
822640	823640	We're all drinking champagne.
823640	824640	What can I say?
824640	825640	This is the second time Dan's been on the show.
825640	827880	This is great champagne.
827880	829360	Any last minute stories tonight?
829360	830360	Loki.
830360	831360	Yes.
831360	832360	Of course, I have stuff.
832360	837840	The first thing I want to talk about is release dates, because, of course, I have stuff.
837840	842280	It's all very interesting and always very controversial.
842280	847840	This mostly is from Sega, who we've had some problems with in the past about Phantasy Star
847840	853620	Universe, but anyways, let's talk about next gen, shall we?
853620	859880	Virtual Fighter V for the PlayStation 3 is slated to come out March 15th of next year,
859880	861200	so look forward to that.
861200	868240	Also gracing our presence will be Virtual Tennis 3 for both the PlayStation 3, the Xbox
868240	875520	360, and the PSP, all those coming out on the 21st of March next year.
875520	880800	This one we ran on the site also, and this is probably the first you'll hear of it.
880800	888000	Full Auto 2 coming to the PSP March 14th, so it's not just PlayStation 3 anymore.
888000	890560	Very interesting on that.
890560	895800	And then this one, which is very controversial, since there was some news from From Software
895800	898760	that this version might not be coming out.
898760	906360	Coming from Sega, Armored Core 4 on both the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360, March 21st.
906360	911480	These dates were just updated in our system on the 11th of September, so this is very
911480	913760	fresh news.
913760	919640	Also After Burner for the PSP coming out March 21st as well, so look forward to those wonderful
919640	922640	Sega games March of next year.
922640	927200	Alright, I am going to open up the Skype line over at Orangelaunchradio.com, click on interact
927200	932920	with us, or you can always call us on the regular telephone as well, it's 916-226-9067.
932920	936320	I imagine the Skype line is going to be very popular tonight, we'll get through as many
936320	939960	calls as we can, we're practically dedicating a whole segment to it, we'll see.
939960	943160	Well, they're already coming in, so let's pick up a call and start going.
943160	945520	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
945520	946520	This is Meg Z.
946520	947520	Hi Meg Z!
947520	948520	Meg Z!
948520	949520	How are you Meg Z?
949520	950520	I am fantastic.
950520	951520	I just went deaf.
951520	954560	From all the girly screaming in here, I think I just went deaf.
954560	956560	What's on your mind?
956560	957560	Wii!
957560	958560	Wii!
958560	961440	Are you excited about the Wii news, or are you just celebrating our 200th episode with
961440	962440	us?
962440	963440	A little bit of both.
963440	965840	Alright, you're definitely going to be getting a Wii?
965840	971840	Oh man, the morning after I knew, I had called my GameStop at 9 in the morning to see if
971840	975960	we could do reserves yet, and unfortunately we couldn't, but yes, I will be getting a
975960	976960	Wii.
976960	977960	Alright!
977960	978960	What games do you want to pick up?
978960	984160	I would like to stress that I predicted the date.
984160	985160	How did you predict the date?
985160	987160	Did you just pull it out of your butt, or did you make connections?
987160	988160	Here's my reasoning.
988160	989160	Here's my reasoning.
989160	994280	Okay, so if you guys with decent memories remember, the GameCube launched shortly after
994280	999640	the Xbox did, and it did phenomenally that holiday season.
999640	1004920	And the PS3 launches on a Friday, the 17th of Friday, and I know Nintendo likes to launch
1004920	1009440	their systems on Sundays, so I said, hey, Sunday the 19th, that could be their release
1009440	1010440	date.
1010440	1011440	That's my prediction.
1011440	1015600	And then not three hours later, the information got leaked that it was going to be released
1015600	1017040	on that Sunday.
1017040	1025320	I'm sitting here looking at a text message on my phone that says November 19th from Megzi.
1025320	1027920	Well good job on that, making an educated guess to do it.
1027920	1031560	So your internet penis grew by two inches for that.
1031560	1032560	Congratulations.
1032560	1035040	I've also got a funny story.
1035040	1036960	Yeah, the funny story.
1036960	1042920	Okay, so lately I've been trying to catch up on games that I might have missed.
1042920	1045640	They came out and they were great, but for some reason I didn't pick them up.
1045640	1048280	So the other day I picked up Metroid Prime, right?
1048280	1052160	Because I never got a chance to play it and I wanted to try it out.
1052160	1055960	So after I got off of work, I called Chris and-
1055960	1058200	Chris is looking angry at this story already.
1058200	1060200	Oh, she's flipping you off.
1060200	1061200	All right, let's hear it.
1061200	1064600	So I called up Chris and I was like, so this is what I did during my day.
1064600	1072400	And I picked up Metroid Prime and she says, oh, is that the one with the monkey?
1072400	1076640	Aw, poor Chris.
1076640	1078240	We love you, Chris.
1078240	1083040	And so we decided we're going to make a game called Metroid Primate.
1083040	1084320	I thought it was a different game.
1084320	1086640	I did not claim to be an expert on video games.
1086640	1090560	I know, but Metroid and a monkey, what was your-
1090560	1091720	I'm going to prove to you.
1091720	1092720	I thought it was a different game.
1092720	1095120	That's why you thought it was like Dungeon Siege or something.
1095120	1096120	No, I didn't.
1096120	1097120	I thought it was an RP.
1097120	1098640	Megsy, it's Dungeon Zoo.
1098640	1099640	Shut up.
1099640	1100640	Dungeon Zoo.
1100640	1106720	I'm still going- Megsy, we need to like start doing pictures of Metroid Primates.
1106720	1107720	Hells yeah.
1107720	1108720	All right.
1108720	1109720	Me.
1109720	1110720	Me.
1110720	1111720	Me.
1111720	1112720	Me.
1112720	1113720	Heart.
1113720	1114720	Heart, we love you, Chris.
1114720	1115720	You hear this?
1115720	1116720	She's invited the biteage.
1116720	1117720	I do want to point out though, Wonder Dog Harold in our chat room says Samus with a
1117720	1118800	pet monkey would be the best.
1118800	1121280	I bet she'd- We love you, Chris.
1121280	1126600	You bring us- Speaking of pets, you heard this week that
1126600	1130680	they announced Seaman 2 for the PlayStation 2 coming out.
1130680	1131680	Tee hee.
1131680	1132680	What?
1132680	1133680	Tee hee.
1133680	1134680	All right.
1134680	1137280	Megsy, we got to take some more calls because everybody's trying to get in tonight, but
1137280	1139280	any last words?
1139280	1143000	Oh, Reggie, you're so fine.
1143000	1144000	You're so fine.
1144000	1145000	You blew my mind.
1145000	1146000	Hey, Reggie.
1146000	1147000	Hey.
1147000	1148000	All right.
1148000	1149000	Hey, Reggie.
1149000	1150000	Reggie fan.
1150000	1151000	I'm sorry.
1151000	1152000	All right.
1152000	1153000	Aw, Chris is pouting.
1153000	1154000	You want to say anything to Megsy, Chris?
1154000	1155000	I love you.
1155000	1156000	I hate you.
1156000	1157000	I love you too.
1157000	1160000	I hate you so much.
1160000	1161280	Hey, Chris.
1161280	1162280	You know what that- Megsy.
1162280	1163280	Megsy.
1163280	1164280	Megsy, you know what that means though?
1164280	1165280	You know what that means though?
1165280	1166280	What?
1166280	1167280	Makeup sex.
1167280	1168280	Ooh.
1168280	1169280	All right.
1169280	1170280	See you later.
1170280	1171280	See ya.
1171280	1172280	Bye.
1172280	1173280	I thought you were making a trip to Wisconsin pretty soon, Chris.
1173280	1174280	I know.
1174280	1175280	I'm going next weekend.
1175280	1176500	And there's going to be lots of makeup sex.
1176500	1177500	Lots and lots of makeup sex.
1177500	1178500	Hi.
1178500	1179500	You're on Orange.
1179500	1180500	Whoa.
1180500	1181500	We're getting feedback.
1181500	1182500	Hi.
1182500	1212480	Hi, this is Bob Coffee from the chat room.
1212480	1238200	We are on Purple and we are on Yellow and we are on Yellow and
1238200	1242120	we are on Yellow and
1242120	1247320	comment I'd like to make and sorry about the
1247320	1251080	shitty first call. That's alright, no no, you got a bad hum so that's alright
1251080	1252320	you'll be able to hear it and
1252320	1255600	try to figure out what the problem is. I gotta let you go though buddy. Thanks so much for the call
1255600	1256880	we like hearing from new people
1256880	1261120	interesting thought that Nintendo 64 was going to be $249 when it first came out
1261120	1263480	and then they cut the price last minute could that happen again
1263480	1267000	I think the pack-in game kinda breaks this deal here I think with Wii Sports
1267000	1269720	being in there I think $250 is kinda set in stone
1269720	1273920	I don't see it getting cut at the last minute but who knows anything's possible right
1273920	1277080	right? I think it all comes down to their feedback
1277080	1280760	they get from people. Alright let's go to another call. Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
1280760	1283840	Greetings my brother and sister in
1283840	1287840	this is Mel B actually. Hi Mel!
1287840	1292080	Wow, Mel you were here forever ago. You've known of Orange Launch Radio since
1292080	1293720	episode like six
1293720	1299400	Pretty much. Wow. I've seen you in like what maybe three different studios already
1299400	1303560	Yeah we've been to a lot of different places we've gotten evicted from a lot of places
1303560	1308480	What's on your mind buddy? Oh well you know it's 200 you know I had to weigh in you know
1308480	1311680	say congratulations to you guys. Appreciate it
1311680	1315840	you know it's just I'm just really proud of how you guys have grown by
1315840	1320160	within this 194 episodes I guess since I first seen you
1320160	1323400	I mean I can remember back in the day when you know it's like
1323400	1326760	you guys would have to be scrapping to get contact left and right
1326760	1330800	like you know I'd be trying to hook you up with this and now you guys are like making a name on
1330800	1333720	your own and it's like you know I can just fade in the background and
1333720	1338400	I mean you guys have just been darn good ever since. Well we appreciate you you know taking a
1338400	1341280	chance on the show when it was such a little deal you know you were a big name
1341280	1344640	in the DDR scene for freestyle and everything well still are too just
1344640	1345680	you know DDR in general
1345680	1348960	you know you haven't had a lot of tournaments lately but you know you came on our show
1348960	1350160	kinda early on
1350160	1353680	and a lot of people recognize you from freestyle so that's great
1353680	1357280	and you know it kind of enabled us to be all friends and stuff after that so
1357280	1363000	really it was kind of good to have Mr. DDR on there. Yeah guys actually both kind of like cutting one of those first radio promos for you back then.
1363000	1367120	Yeah it was awesome. So what do you think of the DDR scene now versus four years ago when the show
1367120	1367600	started?
1367600	1370920	I think I mean a lot of it
1370920	1374560	kinda I mean it's been a major shift whereas before there was sort of like a
1374560	1379160	kinda like a 60-40 split where freestyle was bringing in a lot of casual
1379160	1379880	people in
1379880	1383760	but now it's become such a technical sport now with Perfect Attack and White Hot
1383760	1387040	it's pretty much a standard now. Freestyle is sort of like
1387040	1390040	I think people just aren't pushing each other nowadays to be better
1390040	1393520	they're just kinda like waiting for some tournament to come around they're just doing
1393520	1398480	something good enough to win so there really just isn't that progress for quite yet
1398480	1402760	and I don't see one up because Supernova's got so many darn songs that you know
1402760	1406000	people were begging for but you know what can you do I mean
1406000	1410000	I'm sure I'm gonna break out some more routine sooner or later but you know until then
1410000	1414160	I guess I'll just be laying in the cut. Is In the Groove partially to blame for
1414160	1415120	freestyle
1415120	1419240	going down and PA going up?
1419240	1423440	Well I mean there just wasn't that much to do in the group for freestyle but I think
1423440	1423920	kind of
1423920	1427960	I think with freestyle it was just sort of like to the point where
1427960	1431280	I think I mean just kinda looking back now just in retrospect
1431280	1434560	I think a good freestyle sort of has a very short
1434560	1437920	life span I guess if you could say it's sort of like
1437920	1442000	you're hot for a good six months or a year but then afterwards it's like judges
1442000	1445120	you know get tired of your act and you know they want to see something new but
1445120	1448560	no one new has really stepped up since like 2003, 2004
1448560	1453520	So well I hope Supernova can just turn some of that around I guess we'll see huh?
1453520	1457320	I'm pretty sure I mean I do know some people that are still hungry and waiting for their
1457320	1460240	big chance to you know break out on the team that I think
1460240	1463840	it's gotta be the onus is on a lot of people who are big into
1463840	1467440	freestyle community that still have name value to put together events even
1467440	1471200	doesn't even have to be like a tournament for a thousand bucks whatever you just could
1471200	1474600	get good get-togethers you know just videotape it and you know just get the
1474600	1476240	word around by you know whatever
1476240	1478800	YouTube will get people back into Spain
1478800	1482160	well it'll be very interesting to see what happens you know in the future and
1482160	1485520	everything and I know OLR wants to do some type of DDR tournament we've got
1485520	1487720	some ideas so we'll see what happens in the future
1487720	1490560	you can definitely count on me to give you a hand with that one

1629880	1632520	having a really emo week and I was about ready to come on here and go I quit
1632520	1637480	but you know in the end it's really you know it's about you guys and about you
1637480	1639160	know of course Loki and Dark Sakura
1639160	1642280	just getting to hang out with them every week and everything and while we may
1642280	1645800	have our ups and downs sometimes you know it all comes back to games here at
1645800	1647560	Orange Lawn's radio so it's it's good
1647560	1650880	it's the it's the great equalizer
1650880	1654640	and second thing was I saw the Nintendo Wii press conference
1654640	1657040	well what did you think?
1657040	1660640	well yay that it's coming out so early I was
1660640	1663840	half thinking it was going to be delayed but you know they
1663840	1668120	they actually kept it and they also were talking about
1668120	1672160	how you can put like videos on the memory card
1672160	1675640	and play them back
1675640	1678720	now do you think with codecs and all that do you think
1678720	1681800	everything's going to work universal or you could just download something
1681800	1686280	or pay 20 Wii points and get the newest codec that works with everything?
1686280	1690000	Do you have a thought, Loki?
1690000	1693000	You know what they're running as far as graphics
1693000	1696680	you know a graphics card in there. Would it be licensing with the codecs too
1696680	1700160	could come into play? Some codecs are free but yeah I mean
1700160	1704080	this is whatever they want to do I mean it I'm sure it's going to support like
1704080	1705880	MPEG-2 and stuff like that because
1705880	1709760	I mean they were basically kind of thinking can you take your camcorder and you
1709760	1713160	plug in your SD memory card from that into there and you get to watch videos
1713160	1718040	alright well you going to be picking up a Wii?
1718040	1721400	Oh yes. Alright.
1721400	1724720	I'm going to be picking up the PS3. You are going to get a PS3.
1724720	1728200	I told you I had to. Oh that's right that's right because you had to buy the one for your friend
1728200	1729800	because of the bet and everything. Alright well
1729800	1734040	you're not going to buy one for yourself? Well the Wii for myself, yes.
1734040	1737960	The PS3, hell no. Why not? Why no PS3 for yourself?
1737960	1742800	There's nothing at launch that really drives me to get it.
1742800	1746440	Sony's gonna have to sell it really really sell it at Tokyo Game Show to show
1746440	1747600	us why we need one at launch
1747600	1751200	should be interesting. Alright. Thanks.
1751200	1754400	No problem. Hey we gotta let you go buddy because we got more calls coming in but thanks so
1754400	1755360	much for calling in tonight.
1755360	1759240	Alright later. Lots and lots of calls tonight. We really appreciate it.
1759240	1763200	Let's go to another call. Oh my gosh we're getting so many calls tonight. Hi you're on Orange
1763200	1764400	Falls Radio. Who's this?
1764400	1767920	Raven's Dolphin. Hi Raven's Dolphin. What's on your mind buddy?
1767920	1772080	Sorry I'm on my cell phone but this is Skype's working.
1772080	1775400	That's alright you know we're getting hammered left and right tonight. What's on your mind?
1775400	1778800	I got a hairline
1778800	1782040	fracture on my DS. How'd that happen?
1782040	1785120	I don't know and I replaced it
1785120	1788720	and BB charged me 50 bucks for it. Ouch!
1788720	1792840	You didn't have one of those replacement policy things or whatever? No I had it.
1792840	1795960	But you'll trade it in and you'll get a black one.
1795960	1801120	Oh huh interesting. Was this a DS Lite that cracked or a DS Fat?
1801120	1804200	Oh it was a Lite and I was pissed.
1804200	1808480	Wow yeah I got a lot of problems with that. But didn't Nintendo do some type of
1808480	1812760	replacement system or was that just the UK? I don't remember. It's been so long now.
1812760	1815840	They charged you 50 bucks to replace it?
1815840	1820280	Was it your fault?
1820280	1823640	Here's the thing. They replaced it but
1823640	1827320	it would only be a white one. It wouldn't be a free black one which pissed me off.
1827320	1831920	Oh I see. Did you have a black one or did you have a white one and you wanted to get a black one?
1831920	1836880	I had a white one and I wanted to get a black one. Ah well that's why they charged you for it.
1836880	1840480	God it's just a stinking color though but I guess you know maybe there's more
1840480	1842680	demand for the black ones right now or something I don't know.
1842680	1847880	Why would you want a black one? It wouldn't match your Wii. Well everyone wanted a black one.
1847880	1853520	Didn't you say you wanted a pink one? I want a pink one! I almost bought one at Walmart but I'm poor.
1853520	1858080	Because we don't make money off OLR. But some day.
1858080	1863880	Anything else on your mind Raven's Dolphins? We have to get some more calls.
1863880	1867520	Oh sure. There's one more thing on my mind.
1867520	1871520	It's they're doing the right thing with it.
1871520	1875400	How so?
1875400	1878560	Because how the name is and how they're setting it up
1878560	1882320	they're really putting Sony in jeopardy this time.
1882320	1886520	We'll all see after the Christmas season when the numbers come out. I think you might be right though.
1886520	1889840	Alright I'm definitely trying to get a Wii.
1889840	1893400	I'm going to stand in the freezing cold on a Walmart
1893400	1898000	or at EB. I'm paying someone to get it. Just let's hope that whole little
1898000	1900840	thing about what they're supposedly doing in Hawaii with the whole fifty
1900840	1902120	dollars to reserve
1902120	1905720	or fifty dollars in trade-ins to reserve it doesn't catch on nationwide because
1905720	1906600	that's kinda poopy.
1906600	1911280	So we'll see. Alright guys so I'm gonna cut it short and go.
1911280	1915200	Alright. It's all good buddy. Have a good one.
1915200	1918640	Alright. Lay it up. Wow we're just getting
1918640	1921680	more and more calls. We'll just keep it going. Why not? We have a whole nother
1921680	1924920	section to show here tonight. Let's go to another call. Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio.
1924920	1925400	Who's this?
1925400	1929720	It's me Ron. What's up fellas? Hey how you doing? Hey wait a minute. I'm doing good.
1929720	1934640	I do not believe the lady sitting behind me is a fella. Ron, how could you forget?
1934640	1939440	I splashed you with stupid stuff from China. What can I tell you?
1939440	1944560	I am not cursed. Alright. What's on your mind, Rama? Not much. A few things. I finally saw a
1944560	1947080	Dance Revolution yesterday and it wasn't that bad.
1947080	1951240	Really? I heard it was a vomit in my mouth. You know what's interesting?
1951240	1955240	The show is not being carried in Sacramento so we couldn't see it.
1955240	1958560	Yeah. It's not on a CBS out there? No it's not on a CBS.
1958560	1963520	I looked at the preview guide and there was not anything there. So kudos to KOVR 13.
1963520	1967800	Good job guys. No crap on that network. Good job.
1967800	1972040	Does Viacom own them? I don't know but I heard there was no like actual DDR
1972040	1973400	stuff on the show. There wasn't.
1973400	1979400	It's the same font and that's about it. It's basically Dance Fever with little
1979400	1983880	kids and it's a contest and the grand prize is a $25,000 scholarship from Konami.
1983880	1988480	Okay so why was that not shitty? I don't know because I thought it wasn't so bad.
1988480	1992400	It broke the mold. Everybody was thinking it was going to be DDR this, DDR that, you know?
1992400	1996200	Are you a twelve-year-old girl?
1996200	1999680	No. Okay. Do you think twelve-year-old girls will like the show?
1999680	2004640	I have no idea. Bandit in our chat room says,
2004640	2008040	fuck Dance Fever. Fuck you too. Alright.
2008040	2012220	Anything else on your mind buddy? I wanted to say some other things
2012220	2015360	but I have here in my hands a 22 ounce
2015360	2020040	ounce of Guinness and I'm about to open it up and I'm having a toast here for you guys.
2020040	2023680	I appreciate that. A toast to you? Yeah. Here's to you,
2023680	2027280	here's to me, the best of friends we will be. But if we should ever happen to agree,
2027280	2027680	well
2027680	2031000	fuck you and here's to me. I'm down on this bitch right now.
2031000	2034080	Enjoy that Guinness motherfucker. I'll see you in October.
2034080	2038080	Got that shit right. Later.
2038080	2042000	Let's go to one of our old favorites. I've been making the poor bastard wait all night.
2042000	2046280	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this? One and only Legend of Zaku.
2046280	2050640	What's on your mind Mr. Zaku? Well, just, you know,
2050640	2054720	200 episodes man. That's a feat right there that you can't
2054720	2058840	accomplish without effort. It wouldn't be a 200th episode without our
2058840	2062080	200 minutes worth of phone calls caller here, Zaku.
2062080	2066040	Yes. Digital life's coming up. You excited? You going to go see Final Fantasy XII?
2066040	2071680	Yeah, that and I'm trying to pick out a freestyle routine. I'm trying to pick out a song most importantly.
2071680	2074880	I kind of have a case of Freestyler's Block at the moment.
2074880	2078280	Alright, you going to come visit me in October because I'm coming to New York?
2078280	2081560	Yeah, most definitely. I'll even give you the stuff that I'm a
2081560	2085400	snag from Digital Life. You going to get us another signed poster? Because that was pretty bad ass.
2085400	2090040	He got us this signed poster. That depends if Rocks or Red Octane has something set up.
2090040	2093400	We'll take anything. We like free things. Oh, alright then.
2093400	2097840	You know Supernova's Patch came out last week, right?
2097840	2101400	That's right. We have a patch and there's a new song in it, right? Some type of remix?
2101400	2104520	Fascination Eternal Love Remix. Should be fun.
2104520	2107720	It basically is a
2107720	2111880	remix of Fascination Max
2111880	2117240	but with the sounds that you get from opening a door in the car.
2117240	2122760	The little ringing sound and just a lot of phone ringing right there.
2122760	2125520	I think you have the video up there on your site.
2125520	2128000	Okay.
2128000	2135000	Anyways, the last thing. I don't get how Nintendo flip flops on what they say.
2135000	2138360	On one side they said they were going to be reaching free but on the other
2138360	2142080	they act as if they didn't exist. They end up denying it.
2142080	2145680	Someone hasn't made a final decision on it. Management can't.
2145680	2148880	The left hand's not talking to the right hand. That's exactly what's going on.
2148880	2151960	Happens in corporate America all the time.
2151960	2156780	I was pretty excited on Thursday when I heard all these wonderful fairy tales
2156780	2157720	about the Wii.
2157720	2161440	Then all of a sudden we have this little black eye
2161440	2165000	that came days later.
2165000	2168800	Was the news the end of the world though, Zaku?
2168800	2173760	I mean, you know what? Screw the Wii and PS3.
2173760	2177080	It's all about Happy Sky CS. That's it.
2177080	2179820	I'm focusing all my energy on something besides the hype.
2179820	2183480	Beatmania is the only game you need, huh?
2183480	2186880	Sounds fair. We got to let you go, Zaku. We got more calls.
2186880	2191320	Peace.
2191320	2196400	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
2196400	2199640	Hi, it's Arcadian42.
2199640	2202640	What's on your mind?
2202640	2206480	I had to call in because I haven't listened in a while. I had a connection from the first show
2206480	2210720	since I think I was there. You were there on the first show and this is the
2210720	2212400	most we've ever heard from you
2212400	2216880	in like 200 episodes worth of shows.
2216880	2220240	No, I know. We appreciate your support over the years, Arcadian42.
2220240	2223960	It's been less recently since I've been playing
2223960	2227640	too many video games lately. What do you think of the Wii?
2227640	2231320	It looks like it will be interesting. I haven't really been following the news,
2231320	2236040	but since I might have money soon, I might actually be able to buy one.
2236040	2239080	Awesome. Is that the system of choice
2239080	2242880	amongst the three? I don't know. I'll have to see what I want.
2242880	2247520	Alright, sounds good. Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
2247520	2252000	Not really. Just congratulations on your 200 episodes.
2252000	2255200	Maybe I'll see you and come to a future show.
2255200	2258480	Yeah, anytime. The door's open to you anytime.
2258480	2261320	That's awesome. Thank you so much. It really means a lot to us that we have
2261320	2263920	folks that remember us all the way from episode one still calling in.
2263920	2267040	I know you've been a longtime supporter of the show. We really appreciate it, my friend.
2267040	2270520	Alright. Alright, have a good one, buddy. You too. Later.
2270520	2275160	Lots and lots of good news. Let's do at least one more call here. Hi, you're on Orange Lomps Radio.
2275160	2275800	Who's this?
2275800	2278760	AJ Twist. Hi, what's on your mind?
2278760	2282880	Just calling in to say happy 200th birthday.
2282880	2285800	Thank you.
2285800	2288880	Yeah, that's it. Seeing how you guys are.
2288880	2292200	Basically, I want to talk to Dark Sakura about Tekken DR.
2292200	2295640	Okay. Dark Sakura?
2295640	2299400	Yes. How are you liking the game?
2299400	2304600	I have to say that I like it a whole lot because I'm just such an uber Tekken fan girl
2304600	2305040	that
2305040	2308960	it's all about. Though, I always play with Jin every time.
2308960	2312560	But it's really fun. I like that you have so many different characters to choose from.
2312560	2315360	It's pretty cool.
2315360	2318880	I don't know if you remember my letter I wrote in.
2318880	2322320	Two, three, four months ago, maybe? Oh, it was the Pink Yoshi?
2322320	2328000	I think... I seem to recall a handle named Pink Yoshi because I'm sure I would have made
2328000	2328520	fun of it.
2328520	2332560	Yeah, yeah, you did. I see.
2332560	2335760	Nothing personal, my friend.
2335760	2341760	No, it's all good. But yeah, I'm still up for some good matches with you, Dark Sakura, and Tekken.
2341760	2343920	Some day? Some time?
2343920	2347680	Some time. Right now it's been kind of crazy busy, but I'm
2347680	2352160	working on trying to set some time aside. If I can ever wrestle the
2352160	2356480	PSP away from Dan, except he's been... I'll have to take it when he's distracted with
2356480	2357000	pinball.
2357000	2360280	You guys will have to set up some time on the Orange House Radio message forums.
2360280	2363720	Yeah, send me a message on the forums and we'll see about setting something up.
2363720	2366760	Are you aware of the ghost system?
2366760	2370400	I'm sorry? Are you aware of the ghost system? No, actually.
2370400	2373920	If you play through the dojo,
2373920	2378280	eventually you can unlock the ghost system, which records your character as you play
2378280	2381720	and act as your ghost, and you can play that.
2381720	2385080	Other players can play that online. Oh, that's pretty cool. That's kind of neat.
2385080	2388600	I'll have to do that, then. Once you get that ghost,
2388600	2392080	maybe you can somehow rip it out of the PSP and
2392080	2397960	online, send it over to me and I'll send you my ghost. Wow, that's kind of neat. I wish they did that for Mario Kart.
2397960	2401640	I'll have to set some time aside.
2401640	2405400	Check out Tekken if I may plug in the site. Is that alright?
2405400	2408800	Yeah, I'm going to miss that. Tekken what? Tekken Zaibatsu.
2408800	2412440	Oh, the Tekken Zaibatsu? Yeah, they have a
2412440	2415920	little forum on that, too. Oh yeah, I used to go to that site all the time
2415920	2419800	to get all the pictures and everything from the official Namco art.
2419800	2424400	I haven't been to that. I actually haven't been to that site in easily a year. I forgot about it.
2424400	2427960	But no, I... Yeah, it hasn't been too big lately.
2427960	2431160	Not much going on. No, that's a cool site. I'll have to check out the forum.
2431160	2434080	Thanks. Alright, any other thoughts?
2434080	2437120	Yeah, oh, Logi. Huh?
2437120	2440600	A question about the PSP on hacking it.
2440600	2444640	Since you're big on that. What now? A question on the PSP hacking.
2444640	2450000	Yeah. Do you know any cool type of media players that can play playlists?
2450000	2453200	Hmm, that can play playlists.
2453200	2456920	I know they had some stuff where you can stream
2456920	2460120	playlists from your PC.
2460120	2464600	Yeah, I know that one, too. What's the website you always use? PSP updates or something?
2464600	2468080	PSP updates has a lot of stuff on there. Check it out. Yeah, I'll go check around there more.
2468080	2473000	Alright. Alright, thanks anyways. Well, we gotta let you go, my friend. We got some more calls to
2473000	2475360	get through, and then we're gonna end the show.
2475360	2478600	Yeah, happy 200th episode again, and have a good night.
2478600	2482320	Alright. Have a good one, buddy. Bye-bye.
2482320	2486120	Alright, we at least... This number's been trying to hammer us for a little bit now.
2486120	2488160	Alright. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio. Who's this?
2488160	2489160	I made it!
2489160	2491400	Hi, whoa, hi. Who's this?
2491400	2492360	This is DT.
2492360	2495040	Huh? Oh, DT, what's on your mind?
2495040	2497800	Oh, I've been trying to call in for...
2497800	2502120	ever since the segment opened. I know we've been hammered tonight. It's crazy. What's on
2502120	2504720	your mind, my friend?
2504720	2507720	Well, I just wanted to wish you guys a happy 200th.
2507720	2511080	Appreciate it. You've been with us since, like, episode one, right?
2511080	2514120	Oh, yeah, absolutely.
2514120	2518640	Well, what do you think about the Wii News? Are you gonna be picking up a Wii?
2518640	2521520	I'll probably get one for Christmas.
2521520	2525840	What games in particular are you looking forward to?
2525840	2528280	Uh, hmm, well...
2528280	2530560	Red Steel looks kinda cool.
2530560	2533200	Not Smash Bros. Brawl? Although, I know that's not Smash Bros. Brawl.
2533200	2534200	Oh, yeah.
2534200	2536120	You're pumped up for that, right?
2536120	2537520	Oh, yeah.
2537520	2541200	So, actually, speaking of Smash Bros. Brawl, are there any other characters that you wanted
2541200	2545760	to see in it, either Konami or Nintendo?
2545760	2549880	Well, I was kinda hoping Lolo and Lala would be in it.
2549880	2551520	Oh, wow.
2551520	2553640	Lolo and Lala.
2553640	2556600	Oh, my God, that is old school.
2556600	2557880	What would they do, turn...
2557880	2562040	They would turn your character into eggs and then push boxes at you.
2562040	2563040	There you go.
2563040	2564040	Way old school.
2564040	2565040	That's pretty cool.
2565040	2571840	Well, DT, I know you've been supporting us since episode one. We really, really appreciate
2571840	2575360	it. Your enthusiasm for this station has been wonderful, and I know you work for our site
2575360	2577880	now, and we love having you on board. Thanks so much for calling in.
2577880	2578880	Anytime.
2578880	2579880	All right, have a good one, my friend.
2579880	2580880	I'll get you.
2580880	2583040	Bye-bye. We'll have to play DDR together someday.
2583040	2584040	I'll have to throw down with him sometime.
2584040	2587440	I haven't seen him in a while. He's local. We, like, never see each other. It's crazy.
2587440	2592040	DT, do I have to tell you? He, like, lives just around the corner practically. We never
2592040	2594600	see him. It's kind of sad.
2594600	2595600	All right.
2595600	2596600	I see him at Dan's store.
2596600	2597600	Oh.
2597600	2598600	I randomly run into him at Dan's GameStop.
2598600	2602000	Oh, snap. Well, thank you guys so much for calling. Oh, we've got one more. We'll make
2602000	2603000	this real quick.
2603000	2604160	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
2604160	2605160	Uh, ActDeft.
2605160	2610240	Oh, yes. What's on your mind, ActDeft? Gotta be quick.
2610240	2611240	I'm calling from Mexico.
2611240	2612240	Oh.
2612240	2615760	Can I ask you to mail to me, too, for your 200th sale?
2615760	2616760	Thank you.
2616760	2618240	What's on your mind?
2618240	2622360	We are going to rock you.
2622360	2626760	I agree. The we is going to be awesome. Well, thank you so much for calling in. We've got
2626760	2629040	to keep it short, though, because we've got to get to our next segment. But that's awesome
2629040	2632680	to hear from people outside of the U.S. once in a while. We love hearing from Canada, Mexico,
2632680	2633680	U.K. We love it.
2633680	2640760	Is he still there? Hello? There must be a delay. I think he hung up. Oh, well.
2640760	2641760	Oh.
2641760	2642760	Oh, well. Well, thank you. We appreciate it.
2642760	2643760	Thanks for calling.
2643760	2646400	I know. I think that's the first call from Mexico we've gotten.
2646400	2647400	I think so.
2647400	2648400	How sweet.
2648400	2649400	Cool. Thank you.
2649400	2650400	Bye.
2650400	2651400	Bye.
2651400	2652400	I'm going to go to Cabo someday. I've never been to Mexico, but I want to go to Cabo.
2652400	2654400	I'm going to go to Tijuana.
2654400	2659400	All right. We're going to do this now. I warned you this would be a little bit random. We're
2659400	2664280	going to bring back a segment that you guys who listen to the old show know. And those
2664280	2667260	of you guys who joined us in the podcast, maybe you've never heard this segment before.
2667260	2672380	But it's been known to get a little bit weird and a little bit random and a little bit questiony.
2672380	2675320	It's this old segment called Ask Orange Lounge.
2675320	2686540	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question. Well, will we find out this week on Orange
2686540	2692800	Lounge Radio? I'm sure it's going to be interesting because we haven't allowed this segment on
2692800	2699120	in over a year because the questions have been lame.
2699120	2707080	So let's see what you guys have pent up over the past year. DMN wants to know, what's the
2707080	2711760	most fun thing and the most frustrating thing about doing Orange Lounge Radio?
2711760	2719840	The most fun thing is having my ego grow. And the most frustrating thing is this room
2719840	2731360	with the door shut. It does get quite hot in here. I don't know.
2731360	2735560	Just trying to stay on top of the news is kind of tough during the week. Remembering
2735560	2741400	to update my show rules. I would say the most fun thing about Orange
2741400	2746360	Lounge Radio. Oh, it's so much fun. No, but it's getting that instant feedback of having
2746360	2750520	people like whether it be Dark Soccer or Loki like right here in my ear or having the chat
2750520	2753400	room there. I think having that feedback on your opinions
2753400	2757100	is really great and kind of neat. I don't know. It's just like the reward I get from
2757100	2760680	it is instant gratification. You know I'm a typical male.
2760680	2764900	The most frustrating thing about doing Orange Lounge Radio is losing my Sunday nights. As
2764900	2768120	much as I enjoy hanging out, but it's tough because it means you only really get a one
2768120	2771960	day weekend. So that's been frustrating. But I don't know. I guess you're just used to
2771960	2774760	it after 200 weeks now, right? That's how I feel.
2774760	2779400	You're just kind of used to it. I have fully timed it. How long do I have to
2779400	2785600	leave the South Bay now to get here? Guys, since we have about at least 20 people
2785600	2789640	who submitted questions tonight, we can't get all your questions in, so we apologize.
2789640	2792840	The things that are a little too random and weird, we may not be able to get to tonight.
2792840	2797000	I apologize. OL Army Eddie wants to know, where can I get
2797000	2802320	all these cool songs you play? The internet. The internet is not just for
2802320	2809840	iTunes. If you ever want to know, try asking in chat. Try emailing one of us. The thing
2809840	2814040	is that when you guys ask during the show, sometimes we're so busy like operating the
2814040	2817440	behind the scenes stuff that we can't answer questions right away. But if you can like
2817440	2821440	hum a few bars, we'll tell you. You can always send us an email. I'm more than fine with
2821440	2826760	sharing song titles. Send me an email.
2826760	2830480	Also he wants to know, I guess I'll go ahead and entertain this question. What would cause
2830480	2838480	Sky to go straight? Be graphic if needed. Oh, Chris. What was that Chris? That might
2838480	2846160	be a good start. I would say One Hot Night with Gina Gershon or Beyonce. I don't know
2846160	2854440	why I love Beyonce. She's so hot. She's really hot. No, I don't know. Honestly, boobs and
2854440	2860520	poon anner just don't do it for me. I'm sorry. I'm sure you appreciate the aesthetic value
2860520	2863400	of boobs. I asked the women out there, do boobs and
2863400	2869200	poon anner do it for you? Well, I know this is probably not the best room to ask this
2869200	2873120	question in, but I'm asking the other women out there. That's how I feel. And guys out
2873120	2881680	there, if you're a straight man, does penis do it for you? That's how I feel about boobs
2881680	2887440	and poon anner. Are you gay? If you scream phone call, you're gay.
2887440	2897940	Act Deaf wants to know, can you speak Spanish? Uno pequeño de Español, si. I had two years
2897940	2903920	of Spanish or dos años de Español in Colegio, but I'm not very good at it. I only remember
2903920	2909080	a few words here and there. El telefono es en fuego.
2909080	2913080	I would like to learn more. I took French and Japanese, so I can also
2913080	2918060	say that the TV is on fire. Act Deaf also wants to know, what's your opinion
2918060	2921320	on Mexican zoning? Pump it up. What's wrong with that?
2921320	2922880	Nothing wrong with that. That's pretty hot.
2922880	2928640	More games for everyone. That's a good thing. No problems there. Unless the country actually
2928640	2936120	bought the game. I don't know. Black Wolf says, how can you type with boxing
2936120	2943040	gloves on your hands? What? A very large keyboard.
2943040	2949540	Use your toes. Lo cuisintes cléverdan. God damn you people that bring Homestar Runner
2949540	2953440	into this show. No, I love Homestar Runner. I can't complain,
2953440	2960000	but you guys are funny. Check on the PMs, check on the PMs.
2960000	2962520	E-mail. Dark Tetsuya wants to know, so what's it like
2962520	2966800	going from reporting on hypodermic needles in Solo 2000 to the Nintendo Wii?
2966800	2970000	Nostalgia. Wow, nostalgia. That was one of our first
2970000	2973200	big topics. I remember calling that arcade.
2973200	2977640	I said, oh, you'll have to talk to our manager. I remember that too. We were pretty cutting
2977640	2979600	out. That was when I was sleeping in the Harry Potter
2979600	2983400	room in the gay frat house. That was awesome.
2983400	2987600	Wow. Yeah, we were. I remember doing the recording
2987600	2994120	a podcast. No, not even a podcast. We were recording a live show while I was playing
2994120	2997960	BeatMania and they were trying to talk to me like, I'm trying to play 3, 2, 1 stars,
2997960	3002720	dammit. You know, it's just been crazy. There's been
3002720	3006880	a lot of, it's funny how games have changed in the past four years because when we started
3006880	3010400	doing this show, Max 2 was new in the arcades and then we went through Extreme, we went
3010400	3016160	through a drought, now we're into Supernova. All right, more songs. We want to get out
3016160	3020480	of here before midnight tonight. GS68 wants to know, do any of you play O2Jam?
3020480	3024760	I tried it out about six months ago and I had a pretty good time with it. I just haven't
3024760	3032800	been back. I don't do well with the games. I don't know. I'm not good at checking in
3032800	3037120	regularly with games like that for some reason. I did play recently a game that somewhat reminded
3037120	3041040	me of it though, which was the R2B, which was kind of fun. I should check it out again
3041040	3045040	and see what's changed there. Has anyone else played O2Jam? No? Yes? No?
3045040	3053720	I looked at it at E3 and then walked on. All right. Let's see. NintendoManiac64 wants
3053720	3058680	to know, could I race Loki at Mario Kart DS? I never got the chance and I've gone anti-snaking
3058680	3063560	since nine months ago. That sounds like a 12-step program.
3063560	3070680	I literally dusted off Mario Kart DS today. I haven't played that game in months.
3070680	3077300	All right. Bandit wants to know, if train A is traveling at 50 miles per hour from Pittsburgh
3077300	3081520	and train B is traveling at 35 miles per hour from California, which state will they meet
3081520	3084800	in order to resupply the Orange Lawns radio with more Chocobo Nuggets?
3084800	3089480	Wisconsin! Wisconsin! African or European?
3089480	3094720	Africa! NazgulSlayer wants to know, question, is there
3094720	3097640	a Castro district ghetto? Yes!
3097640	3103760	How about the whole place is ghetto? I actually feel safer there than just about
3103760	3105880	any other places in San Francisco. Yeah, actually if you go around San Francisco
3105880	3108760	it's the safest place I feel. Except for the homeless man who was laying
3108760	3112520	with his cock out. Around for your birthday we found something
3112520	3117760	in the window and it's about like that big around and it's a penis and we're going
3117760	3121680	to get you for your birthday. I'm going to chase you around the house with
3121680	3125920	it. We also found you a codless body suit.
3125920	3131160	That's disgusting. Rama wants to know, you need to talk about
3131160	3135520	the Spanish DDR movie? Yeah, that's right. I watched the trailer
3135520	3138120	for that. La machina de ballar.
3138120	3140960	It actually looks kind of funny. I want to see the actual movie before I talk
3140960	3143340	about it. You know, trailers can be deceiving, right?
3143340	3145120	The trailer looked funny. All right.
3145120	3148640	Poto wants to know, dear Orange Lawns radio, if you had to be a species of bird, extinct
3148640	3151440	or not, which would you be? Dodo.
3151440	3154120	The dodo, I'm hearing Drew and Chris saying. What do you think?
3154120	3156440	I would be a. You'd be a fucking parrot.
3156440	3161320	I'd be a pterodactyl. You'd be the one who shared it with everyone.
3161320	3165840	Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack. Wait, wait, wait.
3165840	3167840	What is that bird? It's not a parrot.
3167840	3170800	It's another bird that lives as long as a human does.
3170800	3173000	Chicken? No, not chicken.
3173000	3178760	No, not chicken. Lovely human. I'd be Toucan Sam.
3178760	3181460	But I don't remember exactly what type of bird it is, but it's a bird that lives as
3181460	3184400	long as a human and is actually very intelligent. A vulture?
3184400	3186920	No, not a vulture. Ooh, I'd be a vulture.
3186920	3190000	No, I'd be a raven because I'm all goth. Nevermore.
3190000	3193600	What about the Norwegian blue? Lovely plumage. Lovely plumage.
3193600	3196160	All right. He's pining for the fjords.
3196160	3201120	He's not pining. He's passed on.
3201120	3206720	This is an ex-parrot. Let's go to the next question here.
3206720	3211280	Sakarina wants to know, do you guys have VJ Army accounts, and if so, what's your DJ name?
3211280	3216840	I do have one, and I haven't ever updated it. I think it's Saku.
3216840	3220080	I don't have one. I have one. I've never updated it. DJ 223M.
3220080	3223240	I don't even know what it is. Yeah, I think mine's DJ Saku.
3223240	3227160	I don't update it. It's too much work for me. I like BeatMania, but I haven't played
3227160	3231120	it enough regularly lately. What's your favorite, also from Sakarina,
3231120	3236440	what's your favorite 2DX style? Seventh.
3236440	3242640	Eighth. Logie? I don't know. I don't play 2DX, really.
3242640	3247200	Oh, yeah, that's right. You hate 2DX. I don't hate it. I just don't play it.
3247200	3251080	Legend of Zaku wants to know, do you guys have any video game inspired drink recipes?
3251080	3253960	Ooh, no. Any what inspired drink recipes?
3253960	3258160	Video game inspired drink recipes, like mixed drinks that are inspired by video games.
3258160	3262480	Burning Heat featuring Hot Damn. That's a good idea.
3262480	3267920	Okay, I'm going to make up one right now. Okay.
3267920	3282520	It's Everclear. Anything with Everclear. It'll have Everclear and let's see what else
3282520	3287800	is pretty awesome. It'll just be Everclear and it'll call it
3287800	3294400	the Super Metroid, because it'll suck your life out.
3294400	3298160	Goldschlager is nasty shit. Goldschlager and Midori, remember that one?
3298160	3304200	The drink is called the Abadox and it's made with Goldschlager and Jagermeister, two of
3304200	3309080	the nasty and cheap tequila. And when you puke, that's the game.
3309080	3313160	Because that's what Abadox looked like. All right, look.
3313160	3316200	Just a couple more quick questions. We're not going to get to all the questions tonight.
3316200	3320800	I apologize, guys. I love Abadox.
3320800	3324280	Duckator wants to know, do coconuts migrate? Yes.
3324280	3331640	Coconuts are non-migratory as would be carried by an African Swallow or European Swallow.
3331640	3334200	You know what's funny is once I went to the grocery store, my old roommate and I were
3334200	3336960	in college and we just bought a coconut because we just wanted to play with it.
3336960	3341880	We wanted to see if we could open it using household tools, because we didn't know.
3341880	3345120	Like you only see on TV. You were just interested in having a hairy
3345120	3346560	ball. Oh, go to hell.
3346560	3349800	Just fucking go to hell. All right.
3349800	3356320	Oh, no, two more questions. SSJ100 Matt wants to know, ask Loki when he will do another
3356320	3359360	Loki Fusion. I haven't done one in a while.
3359360	3364040	I keep toying with it and it's just like writer's block, you know.
3364040	3367160	For those that don't know Loki Fusion, you have your own DDR remix songs, right?
3367160	3371440	Yeah. And they're on, what, Myspace.com slash Loki
3371440	3372440	Fusion? Yeah.
3372440	3377240	All right. All right, last question.
3377240	3381720	I think this is a great question to end on. This is a serious one, okay?
3381720	3384640	You may have to think about this one for a minute, but everybody's got to answer.
3384640	3389280	At least the host, the three of us do. If you could go back to the beginning, prior
3389280	3392280	to the show starting, this came from Solar Wing by the way, I don't know if I said it.
3392280	3396640	If you could go back to the beginning, prior to the show starting, would you do it again
3396640	3404520	or do it differently? This is a tough one.
3404520	3407920	I would have said we should have had Loki on since episode one as a full blown co-host
3407920	3411560	because we just didn't know him well enough then, but he wasn't a true co-host until episode
3411560	3413840	20. A lot of people don't know that, but he wasn't
3413840	3417760	truly a recognized co-host of the show until, he was kind of like a Drew, he just showed
3417760	3421480	up all the fucking time. But yeah, he got promoted to co-host on episode
3421480	3426680	20. I would have said we would have had Loki on board episode one.
3426680	3428320	I don't know. I know what I would do different.
3428320	3430000	What? Not use that retarded headset because I had
3430000	3434520	a migraine the whole episode. Loki?
3434520	3437300	This doesn't really have anything to do with Orange Lounge though.
3437300	3441840	I wouldn't have built the cabinet. That was your pride and joy.
3441840	3447260	I know, you spent so much. And threw it away like a baby, aborted and
3447260	3451800	thrown in the dumpster. I don't think there's anything else. It's
3451800	3455520	hard because we've just learned so many things. You know, I still have those DDR pads.
3455520	3461160	I think I would have tried harder in the beginning to really believe that what we were doing
3461160	3464360	was not just something we were fucking around online, but that it was really generally something
3464360	3467080	people wanted to listen to and I think I would have tried to promote us better in the beginning.
3467080	3471700	Or more general gaming maybe? I think in retrospect, I don't know though.
3471700	3476120	We owe the Bamani scene a lot. I think honestly though, I would have made
3476120	3481160	the shift to general gaming about a year sooner. We should have done podcasting because we
3481160	3485000	would have beat everybody to it by like two years.
3485000	3491560	We should have invented podcasting. I still think that we've done pretty good
3491560	3495600	for something that was conceived on the Bart after a trip to the Metronome.
3495600	3499600	No regrets. I mean sure, there's always things that you might say, well gee, in retrospect
3499600	3503280	maybe I should have done that, but no regrets. Well, this is what I think about regret. If
3503280	3507520	you regret anything you have or have not done, you regret the person that you are today.
3507520	3512880	So in respect to the show, I don't regret anything because our show is what it is based
3512880	3517080	on the decisions that we've made, the interaction of our listeners.
3517080	3520680	I do not regret a single second of it because that makes us what we are right now.
3520680	3523880	SSJ100Matt brings up a good point. We were one of the first shows to introduce Skype
3523880	3527800	calls. People don't recognize that, but we were probably like, if not, I would almost
3527800	3530980	challenge, we were the first internet radio show to do Skype calls.
3530980	3536240	I would challenge that. Find me a show that was doing it before we were because we got
3536240	3539720	on board with that Skype thing really early, don't you think? Because we were doing it
3539720	3540720	before we were even podcasting.
3540720	3542120	We were doing it when Skype was in beta.
3542120	3544600	Yeah, when Skype was in beta we were doing it because I was like...
3544600	3546800	Actually, I think my Skype is still the beta version.
3546800	3547800	So anyway...
3547800	3550080	Skype was first in beta.
3550080	3553600	I mean, I'm not trying to sound like egotistical, but I like to think of the fact that, hey,
3553600	3555600	we've been on the cutting edge of a few things. It's been pretty...
3555600	3559120	The PSP web browser, granted we haven't done too much with that.
3559120	3564480	I mean, although I think we do a great show here, I think we owe the fact that we were
3564480	3568880	one of the first gaming podcasts with an already established fan base thanks to our live show
3568880	3571840	as the reason why we won the podcast award last year.
3571840	3575920	I also think that we're not afraid to go there.
3575920	3581360	That's one thing that we've always tried to hold onto is we don't really censor ourselves.
3581360	3586080	We get it as it is. If we get an explicit tag one week, fuck it.
3586080	3588760	Very good point. Very good point. Fuck it.
3588760	3589760	Yeah.
3589760	3590760	Right in the ear.
3590760	3591760	Fuck the fucking fuckers.
3591760	3598140	All right. On that note, I wanted to go around and see if anyone had any speeches, things
3598140	3601440	they wanted to say to close out the show tonight.
3601440	3605160	I just want to say, you know, I'll start.
3605160	3613280	It's been a really interesting 200 episodes, and I've learned a lot, and I've received
3613280	3618480	such wonderful compliments from you guys out there on the internet, and it makes me feel
3618480	3622360	so good because, you know, when I was in college, I did not know what the hell I wanted to do
3622360	3629200	with my life, and I was starting in, I was doing media arts for a while, meaning I was
3629200	3632960	going to go into television and radio, but I was just convinced I was not cut out for
3632960	3638000	radio because I was not going to blow my way to the top, which is what most people do in
3638000	3639000	the radio industry.
3639000	3643320	A lot of people that you hear on the afternoon drive probably fuck someone to get there,
3643320	3644800	and I wasn't down with that.
3644800	3648800	I wanted to do something, you know, that's when I knew I did not really want to play
3648800	3652440	with the big boys and work that way, that I wanted to kind of do my own thing.
3652440	3659760	So I really appreciate Travis kind of noticing that first on Station Live and kind of asking
3659760	3663640	me to be a part of his show to kind of bring that out of me a little bit, which enabled
3663640	3667600	me to, you know, get the idea going here with Dark Soccer, who I think felt very enabled
3667600	3671640	by that program as well, to kind of come do our own thing here on Orange Lawn Radio, and
3671640	3677960	it's been a fantastic experience, and to have come now to this point where we are working
3677960	3686840	with a guy who started a television network about gaming is just, that's the path I wanted
3686840	3687840	to take.
3687840	3688840	You know what I mean?
3688840	3690120	I didn't want to blow my way to the top.
3690120	3696000	I wanted to work through the back door like a typical gay man, and I'm very happy.
3696000	3698600	And Dark Soccer and Loki, you guys are awesome.
3698600	3703000	And Loki, I really wish we would have had you on episode one, because we didn't know
3703000	3706480	you, despite what you say, we didn't really know you.
3706480	3710000	But it's been awesome, and when we lived together, we had a great time, and I don't think we
3710000	3712480	ever fought once, which made you really great roommates.
3712480	3718840	So that was just awesome, and getting to do the show that apartment in Dark Soccer, sometimes
3718840	3721920	I want to jump out of this chair and strangle you for some of the things that you say on
3721920	3722920	this program.
3722920	3723920	I love you.
3723920	3729320	No, but I love you to death, I love you to bits, and don't ever let anyone out there
3729320	3733000	tell you that you're not good enough for this show, because you are good enough for this
3733000	3738480	show, and you know so much about gaming and stuff, and the guys do not give you enough
3738480	3739560	credit sometimes.
3739560	3743680	You are a girl gamer, and oh God, I just love you.
3743680	3744680	I think you're so smart.
3744680	3745680	You're a record.
3745680	3748820	Well, that's the point.
3748820	3754600	So thank you for everything, and don't ever let internet fanboy people who are pissed
3754600	3758400	off that some girl likes to yell at them once in a while ever get under your skin, because
3758400	3765760	I know it was hard at first when we first went podcasting, but they suck.
3765760	3768760	I can't say anything right now, because I'm emo.
3768760	3770400	Lowkey, do you want to say anything?
3770400	3771840	I don't know what the hell to say.
3771840	3773520	I'm not good at this stuff.
3773520	3775520	No, it's been fun.
3775520	3780520	I like doing the show, and it's just, Nellie doesn't probably like too much that I spend
3780520	3783320	three hours of my week every week.
3783320	3788840	Well, mentally probably way too much time on the show.
3788840	3792760	I mean, my God, I can do stuff at work.
3792760	3794000	It's all game related.
3794000	3795680	It's always game related.
3795680	3797460	Everything's always game related with me.
3797460	3799080	Get a life, Lowkey.
3799080	3805080	Seriously, I think getting married would change everything, but no, it doesn't.
3805080	3816400	The only thing I'm focusing on now is just taking the show to the next step, not letting
3816400	3823040	the other big sites out there bother you with the fact that people take them more seriously
3823040	3827400	and that kind of stuff, because you either have to have a big financial backing or you
3827400	3830840	just have to earn the respect for it.
3830840	3833080	All that comes in time and money.
3833080	3835960	I don't know, it's just going to be interesting.
3835960	3845720	I have no plans on quitting the show, so however long it goes.
3845720	3849600	The first thing that I have to actually say about the show is that if it hadn't been for
3849600	3855440	you guys, I don't think I would have made it through my diagnosis, because this is what
3855440	3856440	kept me going.
3856440	3857440	I had to give up school.
3857440	3858440	I had to give up a lot of work.
3858440	3860720	I had to give up my busy life.
3860720	3865800	But having the show as a constant actually kept me going and everybody writing in with
3865800	3866800	the support.
3866800	3870760	I have to say that that was a big thing for me, because I've always considered myself
3870760	3875880	to be a capable individual and to have that capability sort of get yanked out from under
3875880	3876880	me.
3876880	3880400	Having all the support of our listeners and talking to other people who've had similar
3880400	3883320	is like, wow.
3883320	3887440	That's the biggest thing, is having our listeners, having that type of support network.
3887440	3893840	There's been the people who have, you know, I'm sorry, if you, it was sort of like what
3893840	3899800	Margaret Cho said about Martha Stewart, she was put in jail for being a bitch.
3899800	3906080	I feel like I get hate mail for being an outspoken woman, because there's still this vast majority
3906080	3910720	of, and no offense to any of our guys listening, there's still this vast majority of men out
3910720	3914880	there who think that just because they have a cock, they can tell women what to do.
3914880	3919600	Well, I think G4 fucked a lot of that for everybody, for girls everywhere, because a
3919600	3924440	lot of girl gamers on that shit, girl gamers, quote unquote, are just a set of tits.
3924440	3927320	And Dark Sakura is so much more than just a nice set of tits.
3927320	3929160	Although they are nice.
3929160	3933960	They are nice tits, don't get me wrong, but there's just much more than that.
3933960	3943700	But, you know, it's, it's, it actually gave, doing this show just from, even from getting
3943700	3948600	under sedation, because it was you and Jessica, that, you know, Rob and Jessica.
3948600	3952720	Speaking of a nice set of tits, she was, she was wonderful too.
3952720	3956960	I have to say thank you to Jessica, because I'll go back to that in a minute.
3956960	3957960	Go ahead.
3957960	3962460	You guys brought me in on under sedation and I had been just sort of, you know, I've always
3962460	3967120	been outspoken for people, but very nervous in large groups, you know, and I really got
3967120	3975800	me over a lot of my, my shyness, I think that my residual shyness gave me a lot more ability
3975800	3983160	or I say confidence to really say, you know, tact is one thing, but censoring yourself
3983160	3988120	for the sake, you know, censoring the truth, I think, or how you really feel for the sake
3988120	3994680	of political correctness or somebody else's retarded sensitivities.
3994680	4001060	Doing the show has completely opened up that side of me that has given me courage to stand
4001060	4007920	up for myself as a woman, not just to the gaming community, but at work, you know, in
4007920	4015680	my daily life, you know, I, I feel completely, I mean, doing this, this show has been such
4015680	4023440	a confidence booster that, you know, and I think everybody who's, who has supported my
4023440	4031680	loud mouth, outspoken, bitchy Aries womanliness, I want to thank all of you.
4031680	4035040	And whoever's king, my Lancer needs to die right now.
4035040	4036040	Amazing.
4036040	4037040	Wow.
4037040	4039760	Thank you guys so much.
4039760	4045880	Yes, Drew and Chris, if you guys want to add anything, you don't have to.
4045880	4047540	Shit, shit, guys.
4047540	4048540	It's been a wild ride.
4048540	4052100	I mean, I've been with the guys since episode two, you know, we jumped, jumped the shark
4052100	4056640	in episode one, apparently, but I've been here for the whole downhill ride.
4056640	4063400	And I was listening when I was 16, it's kind of funny that this show sort of defined my
4063400	4064960	adult social life.
4064960	4069760	I grew up with this show and it's kind of sad and it's kind of cool at the same time
4069760	4075680	because for the past few years, this show has been the main constant.
4075680	4084560	And I, you know, I go from awkward teen to intern to scapegoat to bad joke master and
4084560	4085560	you know what?
4085560	4086560	I'm still here.
4086560	4091160	The show is still going strong and I hope, you know, we continue this course for a long
4091160	4099080	time to come because this is the best thing on the internet right now, at least my opinion.
4099080	4100080	Thank you.
4100080	4101080	Wow.
4101080	4102080	Thanks.
4102080	4103080	And thank you for being so supportive of us.
4103080	4104080	You are a true fan.
4104080	4107960	I've always been, you know, one of our number one fans throughout the years.
4107960	4108960	It's amazing.
4108960	4111680	Shit, I lost my train of thought.
4111680	4118120	Oh, I wanted to say about Jessica from Understadation Live, something that I don't know if it's
4118120	4122920	ever been said, Jessica and I couldn't fucking stand each other the last year that we did
4122920	4125120	Understadation Live.
4125120	4126120	And it's cool.
4126120	4127120	We're cool now.
4127120	4128320	I mean, so, you know, it's okay that I say that.
4128320	4131600	I couldn't say that a couple of years ago, but I can say it now, Jessica and I cannot
4131600	4132600	fucking stand each other.
4132600	4135240	I mean, it was really hard to do that program.
4135240	4143800	So I know from experience that being such good friends with you guys is such a relief.
4143800	4146560	It makes doing this show so much easier.
4146560	4151480	And I truly do look forward to having this show every week as being a way that we can,
4151480	4154200	you know, hang out with each other because sometimes our lives are so busy we can't do
4154200	4155840	it without this constant.
4155840	4160680	I do have to say, though, just to your and Jessica's credit, you both hit it very well
4160680	4162240	on the air.
4162240	4163240	It's professional.
4163240	4168600	When I saw Chicago, the end of that movie, and if anybody wants to know exactly what
4168600	4172360	it was like, go watch the end of Chicago, because that's exactly what it was between
4172360	4173360	Jessica and I.
4173360	4174360	It was like we could have...
4174360	4176560	We wanted to kill each other, but it was one of those things where it was like, well, show
4176560	4177560	business.
4177560	4178560	We're just going to get out there and do it.
4178560	4179560	Yeah, we...
4179560	4182760	Yes, to her credit, she was very good at hiding it.
4182760	4186240	And there was even one episode where we had to fake that...
4186240	4187320	It was an April Fool's thing.
4187320	4191920	We had to fake that Travis left, and Jessica and I took over the show, and you would have
4191920	4193780	never known that Jessica and I...
4193780	4196800	That was right after Jessica and I were about ready to kill each other, when everything
4196800	4197800	went down.
4197800	4200920	That episode was right after that, so it was something else.
4200920	4204920	I just remember listening to that episode and sitting at my computer about to bawl,
4204920	4207280	because you know what my position was in between that.
4207280	4210280	Chris, did you want to say anything?
4210280	4211760	I don't know how much I can contribute.
4211760	4214280	I'm kind of a new listener, so...
4214280	4215280	Newbies?
4215280	4216520	Yeah, newbies.
4216520	4220160	I'm a noob.
4220160	4224640	I actually met you, Rob, the first time when we saw Silent Hill.
4224640	4232840	That was the first time I met you, and I listened to a podcast right before that, and I've never
4232840	4235200	really been into video games.
4235200	4239640	I mean, I like video games, but I'm one of those people that is really interested in
4239640	4244640	something, but has absolutely no idea what you guys are talking about.
4244640	4251400	So it's been very educational listening to you guys, and I just didn't know about the
4251400	4253640	Wii until you guys talked about it.
4253640	4256200	So all my gaming news I pretty much get from you guys.
4256200	4257200	That's hardcore.
4257200	4259080	Yeah, it's really hardcore.
4259080	4264120	But it's just nice to make friends, because I don't have a lot of friends, actually.
4264120	4265120	Aww, we love you.
4265120	4266120	A chatroom loves you, too.
4266120	4267120	You know they love you.
4267120	4268120	I love...
4268120	4269120	Yeah.
4269120	4270720	And just for the record, Chris also has a very nice set of tits.
4270720	4273880	I know it's radio, so you guys can't see.
4273880	4274880	He's lying.
4274880	4275880	No, I'm not.
4275880	4276880	No, I'm not.
4276880	4277880	No, I'm not.
4277880	4279280	No, I'm being realistic.
4279280	4282360	I am normal, average.
4282360	4283360	Thank you, Robbo.
4283360	4284360	Stop.
4284360	4285360	Stop.
4285360	4286360	Shut up, Robbo.
4286360	4287360	All right.
4287360	4290360	We have one more person that has a speech.
4290360	4291360	Okay.
4291360	4295760	BlackWolf in our chatroom says, and you know, guesting on OLR was a highlight of my podcasting
4295760	4296760	career.
4296760	4301200	You sappy bitch, you've got a great podcast.
4301200	4307920	He's done 50 himself, and he's done Dragon Con, I mean, he's done cons bigger than we
4307920	4308920	have.
4308920	4309920	Don't get sappy.
4309920	4312920	I don't know if it's the champagne, but I do feel a little weepy.
4312920	4313920	Do you have another glass?
4313920	4314920	All right.
4314920	4315920	Go ahead.
4315920	4316920	All right, look.
4316920	4317920	Here's the thing.
4317920	4323920	Let's turn this show around and start to end this thing on a positive note, because for
4323920	4324920	a long...
4324920	4325920	I thought we ended on a high note.
4325920	4326920	Look, for a long...
4326920	4331860	We actually are going to be ending on a bit of a high note, but I ain't singing it.
4331860	4333200	Here's the deal.
4333200	4340240	There's been a moment in Orange Lounge Radio's history that people, for whatever reason,
4340240	4344080	just seem to love and have never shut up about since the night it happened.
4344080	4350520	The night it happened was November 16th, 2003, and I think it went down in a lot of people's
4350520	4353440	minds in Orange Lounge Radio's history.
4353440	4354440	Here's the weird thing.
4354440	4356640	Jamie wasn't even there that night when this happened.
4356640	4358920	I was staying in the Harry Potter room in the gay frat house.
4358920	4367040	And folks have been begging and begging to please post this somewhere so I can download
4367040	4368040	it.
4368040	4369040	No!
4369040	4373400	So here it is, boys and girls, on this special 200th podcast.
4373400	4377560	A little clip from episode 69 of Orange Lounge Radio.
4377560	4380160	Loki plays karaoke revolution.
4380160	4381160	Wait.
4381160	4387720	I just have to say, the sound quality sucks because we were on dial-up back then, okay?
4387720	4389720	So just bear with us.
4389720	4398600	Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio
4398600	4402560	is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.
4402560	4410160	All right, we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and as promised, we're now going to
4410160	4413640	show off our karaoke talents in a round of karaoke revolution.
4413640	4417640	Say it again.
4417640	4419640	I'm singing.
4419640	4420640	I'm...
4420640	4422640	I'm not gay.
4422640	4424640	I'm singing.
4424640	4428640	I'm happy with my friend.
4428640	4430640	I'm singing.
4430640	4435640	I want the world to know.
4435640	4440640	I'm happy with pussy.
4440640	4443640	I'm singing.
4443640	4446640	I want the world to know.
4446640	4450640	Got the night in show.
4450640	4455640	There's a new me singing.
4455640	4457640	He's laughing.
4457640	4460640	I'm completely happy.
4460640	4465640	Stop making me laugh, Kermit, like you never knew it.
4465640	4468640	I'll make it through.
4468640	4472640	The time has come for me, breaking out of the shell.
4472640	4476640	I have to shout that I'm staying in.
4476640	4479640	I'm staying in.
4479640	4481640	I want the world to know.
4481640	4485640	I'm happy with the pussy.
4485640	4487640	I'm staying in.
4487640	4490640	I want the world to know.
4490640	4494640	I shop on the same side of the street.
4494640	4496640	I got to show the world.
4496640	4498640	Yeah, I'm on the scene.
4498640	4500640	All my abilities.
4500640	4502640	There's so much for me.
4502640	4505640	Somehow I have to make them.
4505640	4507640	Just don't understand.
4507640	4509640	I've got it all in hand.
4509640	4512640	Oh, how I've got it planned.
4512640	4514640	I'm spreading the love.
4514640	4516640	There's more for me to fear.
4516640	4518640	And I just feel so good.
4518640	4520640	Every time I hear.
4520640	4523640	I'm staying in.
4523640	4525640	I'm happy with the females.
4525640	4529640	Got to let it show.
4529640	4531640	I'm actually causing this song.
4531640	4534640	That's pretty amazing, I think.
4534640	4540640	Since I can't sing worth a shit.
4540640	4541640	Oh, yeah.
4541640	4542640	Play that instant mental soul.
4542640	4543640	Oh, yeah.
4543640	4548640	Oh, yeah.
4548640	4555640	Yeah, work in the crowd.
4555640	4557640	Yeah.
4557640	4558640	Yeah.
4558640	4560640	There's my pictures in the crowd.
4560640	4564640	Fuck yeah.
4564640	4566640	I'm coming in.
4566640	4569640	I want the world to know.
4569640	4573640	Got to let it show.
4573640	4575640	I'm staying in.
4575640	4577640	I'm happy with hetero.
4577640	4581640	Just want everyone to know.
4581640	4584640	I'm staying in.
4584640	4586640	I want the world to know.
4586640	4590640	Women are my thing.
4590640	4593640	I'm staying in.
4593640	4594640	I'm sick of this song.
4594640	4598640	You're going to really die.
4598640	4600640	God, this is long.
4600640	4603640	It just doesn't fucking end.
4603640	4607640	Just keeps on going on.
4607640	4610640	I'm going to kill anyone in the chat room that has a recording of this.
4610640	4611640	You're going to so die.
4611640	4613640	I know where you live.
4613640	4620640	As a reminder, the show will be broadcast this week on Thursday.
4620640	4623640	A score of 6,964 points for Loki.
4623640	4625640	Not even a gold record.
4625640	4627640	There is no justice in this world.
4627640	4631640	We're going to shut the game off now.
4631640	4633640	I have not laughed that hard.
4633640	4636640	I laughed so hard I peed.
4636640	4638640	I peed a little.
4638640	4640640	I peed a little bit.
4640640	4642640	I got to hear this when I came back.
4642640	4644640	You weren't even there that week.
4644640	4647640	The girl in there was our original show host, Madam.
4647640	4650640	She needs to come back and be on the show soon.
4650640	4652640	Loki?
4652640	4658640	We'll put him up.
4658640	4661640	God, our show sounded like shit back then, didn't it?
4661640	4667640	You know what? We should have never been a dial-up friendly station.
4667640	4674640	I have both recordings already edited out.
4674640	4677640	I'm not sure if they were recorded on my computer at the time.
4677640	4679640	I think they were edited out of the show.
4679640	4680640	Loki is going to kill me.
4680640	4681640	I have the deep, dark secret.
4681640	4683640	I was the one who distributed that.
4683640	4685640	Whatever. I don't care.
4685640	4688640	Here's the thing. Episode 300 we have is complicated.
4688640	4690640	But until then...
4690640	4692640	No, now listen.
4692640	4694640	Here's what we'll do.
4694640	4697640	The MP3 is on the MySpace page.
4697640	4699640	We've been getting kind of stale.
4699640	4701640	We'll put both of them up.
4701640	4703640	We'll see what we can do.
4703640	4706640	I thought you sounded okay.
4706640	4709640	You should have heard complicated.
4709640	4711640	Maybe pick a random song.
4711640	4713640	Avril Lavigne is complicated?
4713640	4715640	Now that's sexy.
4715640	4718640	Alright guys, I really do not like Karaoke Revolution.
4718640	4720640	We will be back here next week.
4720640	4724640	As always, Sunday night, September 24th, 2006
4724640	4728640	with Orange Launch Radio episode number 201.
4728640	4731640	Same old shit, different week.
4731640	4733640	DDR Sneak Peaks continue next week.
4733640	4737640	Hoping to have an interview next week with a very interesting independent product.
4737640	4739640	I'm looking forward to getting more on that.
4739640	4743640	But for now, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
4743640	4746640	Drew Nami, thanks so much for being here again this week.
4746640	4747640	What's your final thought?
4747640	4750640	Be excellent to each other.
4750640	4752640	Chris, what's your final thought?
4752640	4753640	Party on, dudes!
4753640	4754640	Chris, your final thought?
4754640	4756640	Party time! Excellent!
4756640	4758640	I have no final thought.
4758640	4759640	My brain is dead.
4759640	4761640	But happy 200, guys.
4761640	4762640	Thank you.
4762640	4763640	It's awesome.
4763640	4766640	Enjoy your fat-causing product of chocolate.
4766640	4771640	My final thought is peanut butter.
4771640	4772640	Loki.
4772640	4776640	Would I say jelly time?
4776640	4780640	Let's see here.
4780640	4783640	What the fuck are you doing?
4783640	4789640	I think the living room was inspired by us.
4789640	4791640	They're playing Comcast Karaoke right now.
4791640	4792640	They were playing that before.
4792640	4798640	No, but you might see another show come back, maybe.
4798640	4800640	I'm not going to make any promises.
4800640	4802640	Dark Sakura, your final thought?
4802640	4804640	I have to always say reject false icons.
4804640	4806640	It is episode 200.
4806640	4808640	The photo says buck futter.
4808640	4810640	Buck futter?
4810640	4816640	I read that and I was singing of that Chiba Mato song, Butterfucker.
4816640	4820640	I was singing that in my car.
4820640	4827640	But I'm full of emotional happy right now and cake.
4827640	4832640	Oh, stop taking my foot!
4832640	4838640	As always, thank you guys for supporting independent radio for the past 200 weeks.
4838640	4840640	You guys are awesome.
4840640	4845640	And we can't wait to start all over next week with Orange Lounge Radio episode number 201.
4845640	4852640	Until then, this is Rob Roberts for Dark Sakura, Loki, Junami, and Chris saying see you next week.
4875640	4883640	Thanks for watching!
