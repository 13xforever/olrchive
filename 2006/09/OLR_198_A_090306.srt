00:00:54,295 --> 00:00:55,095
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing?

13
00:00:55,636 --> 00:00:56,056
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm okay.

14
00:00:56,196 --> 00:00:56,656
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, good.

15
00:00:57,296 --> 00:00:59,137
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura is not here tonight.

16
00:00:59,497 --> 00:01:01,957
[SPEAKER_02]: She is celebrating her anniversary this weekend.

17
00:01:02,357 --> 00:01:03,818
[SPEAKER_02]: They got married on September 1st.

18
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:10,743
[SPEAKER_02]: So a big congratulations and happy first wedding anniversary wishes to DarkSakura and Dan the Man, her husband.

19
00:01:11,303 --> 00:01:15,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Filling in tonight, say hello to an old Orange Lounge Radio favorite, Miklatov!

20
00:01:15,405 --> 00:01:15,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

21
00:01:16,005 --> 00:01:16,505
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?

22
00:01:16,865 --> 00:01:17,486
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fine.

23
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:18,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, sounds good.

24
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:21,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's not waste a moment here.

25
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:23,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get right into How Is Your Gaming Week?

26
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:29,851
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to start it off with Loki tonight to tell us about his gaming week, when the games he's been playing and what he likes, what he hates.

27
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:34,219
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing, well, lots of Saints Row because that game's awesome.

28
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,424
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried a little bit of the online and I think it's, I don't know.

29
00:01:39,565 --> 00:01:44,511
[SPEAKER_01]: The games that I played were very laggy to the point where they were pretty much unplayable.

30
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:49,236
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be fun, though, when they get whatever that, you know, what's wrong with it worked out.

31
00:01:49,756 --> 00:01:50,718
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the meantime...

32
00:01:51,761 --> 00:01:52,461
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, it's okay.

33
00:01:52,801 --> 00:01:55,082
[SPEAKER_01]: I did discover that there are cheat codes in the game.

34
00:01:55,222 --> 00:02:01,563
[SPEAKER_01]: Granted, cheat codes you can't get achievements for, but it's fun during lunch hours, you know, and having infinite rockets.

35
00:02:02,043 --> 00:02:13,445
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been keeping myself very occupied with that, and it's pretty cool driving around in a big rig and stuff and killing cops and people and just general mayhem.

36
00:02:15,266 --> 00:02:20,987
[SPEAKER_01]: And then other than that, I did try a little bit more of Rumble Roses XX, and I really don't like the game.

37
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:23,403
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

38
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

39
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:29,410
[SPEAKER_01]: 3 waves of 12 planes and you have to do that for each plane that's in your collection which is there's 32 of them and it takes a very long time it's just it's not that it's impossible it's just so fucking boring and to be honest I don't know why they put that even in there because arcade mode is almost the same as this like mini campaign mode that they have it's just dumb it's a really really dumb game I'm sorry but it is and I do not recommend it for the PlayStation 3 or the Wii when it comes out no matter how you know

40
00:03:30,495 --> 00:03:31,135
[SPEAKER_01]: The Tooth Control

41
00:03:55,885 --> 00:04:00,387
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a cool mission, and I wish there was more of it in the game, but there's not.

42
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,068
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only that one level, and that's it.

43
00:04:02,548 --> 00:04:05,589
[SPEAKER_01]: So, oh well, but it's a crappy game.

44
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:09,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I have to introduce our always present fourth guest, and that is the chat room.

45
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:15,234
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're listening live on this Sunday night, head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on chat.

46
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:20,836
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's see, it was JeremyTodd1 in chat said, Wait, he was complaining about it being boring.

47
00:04:21,077 --> 00:04:22,837
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's boring, why would you do god mode?

48
00:04:22,877 --> 00:04:23,958
[SPEAKER_02]: It would make it even more boring.

49
00:04:25,168 --> 00:04:25,368
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

50
00:04:25,388 --> 00:04:28,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I want to get the game over as quick as possible because it is so boring.

51
00:04:29,211 --> 00:04:36,157
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, basically the whole game requires you to chase after these planes and you have to end up looping around shooting them, looping around shooting them again.

52
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:40,560
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine that for like, oh, trust me, the missions are long enough as it is.

53
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,901
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not want to make them any longer.

54
00:04:43,102 --> 00:04:44,804
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I'm almost done with the game.

55
00:04:45,164 --> 00:04:46,205
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my last achievement.

56
00:04:46,405 --> 00:04:47,266
[SPEAKER_01]: I just need to get it done.

57
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:49,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'll be done with this game.

58
00:04:49,648 --> 00:04:50,268
[SPEAKER_01]: I can sell it back.

59
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:52,690
[SPEAKER_01]: And then play more Ridge Racer.

60
00:04:53,211 --> 00:05:00,393
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fun game and I really wish Ridge Racer 7 was coming out on the 360 but it's not.

61
00:05:00,453 --> 00:05:04,835
[SPEAKER_01]: Sadly enough, I saw the screenshots for Ridge Racer 7 and it makes me want to get a PS3.

62
00:05:06,195 --> 00:05:08,996
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck you, Ridge Racer.

63
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:11,537
[SPEAKER_02]: No wonder there's a lot of Ridge Racer love from Sony.

64
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:12,997
[SPEAKER_02]: It could sell some systems there.

65
00:05:14,318 --> 00:05:16,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about that next time you tell some Ridge Racer jokes.

66
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:18,219
[SPEAKER_01]: It really does sell systems.

67
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:21,120
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really sad because seeing some of these screenshots of

68
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:27,871
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily the first party stuff that they showed at E3, but like Ridge Racer 7 and Fight Night Round 3.

69
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,091
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually looks pretty good.

70
00:05:30,152 --> 00:05:31,092
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know.

71
00:05:31,132 --> 00:05:34,912
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to see it actually being played, but we'll see.

72
00:05:34,932 --> 00:05:41,554
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty much... Oh, and of course, as usual, the Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories.

73
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:43,654
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been playing... We actually did some races.

74
00:05:44,214 --> 00:05:46,174
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually have racing and stuff, and that was pretty fun.

75
00:05:46,294 --> 00:05:49,815
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I should point out, you always have something new to complain about that game, yet you can't stop playing it.

76
00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:52,770
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

77
00:06:20,437 --> 00:06:21,137
[SPEAKER_03]: and... Really?

78
00:06:21,437 --> 00:06:27,418
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have thought that it would have been like the reason why that game sells as well as it's doing is because of multiplayer.

79
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:39,740
[SPEAKER_03]: If it weren't really boring, I'm sure it would be a really good multiplayer game but it kind of sucks a lot and maybe if you had more than three people like we had playing, you can play up to six.

80
00:06:41,061 --> 00:06:41,901
[SPEAKER_03]: That can make it fun.

81
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:48,662
[SPEAKER_03]: But Enchanted Arms is really cool and I enjoy playing that and I've been playing Final Fantasy.

82
00:06:49,522 --> 00:06:51,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Leveling Blue Mage Even Final Fantasy XI?

83
00:06:51,443 --> 00:06:52,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes Specifically?

84
00:06:52,504 --> 00:06:59,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there are any other ones The rest of them are stupid Well there's a new one called Final Fantasy XII that a lot of people are really excited about You know what?

85
00:07:00,068 --> 00:07:03,370
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care Alright That's not a real Final Fantasy game

86
00:07:06,052 --> 00:07:09,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, technically, yes, it is actually a real Final Fantasy game.

87
00:07:09,374 --> 00:07:10,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Not in my world!

88
00:07:10,655 --> 00:07:14,037
[SPEAKER_01]: Some would complain that it's actually more of a Final Fantasy game than XI was.

89
00:07:14,157 --> 00:07:20,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's chocobos, and red mages, and blue mages, and black mages, and white mages, and whatever else.

90
00:07:21,302 --> 00:07:22,062
[SPEAKER_03]: It's way more fun.

91
00:07:22,262 --> 00:07:25,304
[SPEAKER_02]: And red hearts, and green clovers, and purple horseshoes.

92
00:07:25,524 --> 00:07:26,265
[SPEAKER_03]: And blue moons.

93
00:07:26,925 --> 00:07:27,405
[SPEAKER_03]: They're cool.

94
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:27,966
[SPEAKER_03]: They taste good.

95
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:28,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Lucky charms.

96
00:07:29,607 --> 00:07:30,928
[SPEAKER_03]: I want some lucky charms now.

97
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:33,740
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

98
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,381
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't do anything else besides work.

99
00:07:53,602 --> 00:07:54,123
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.

100
00:07:54,163 --> 00:07:56,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, you can't talk about what you're playing at work.

101
00:07:57,425 --> 00:07:58,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I can tell you what I'm playing at work.

102
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Enchanted Arms.

103
00:08:00,768 --> 00:08:02,709
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm playing at work.

104
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:03,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait a minute.

105
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,971
[SPEAKER_02]: That was by Ubisoft.

106
00:08:05,391 --> 00:08:09,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's on my TV a lot, so I guess I'm playing it.

107
00:08:09,754 --> 00:08:11,996
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard a really funny name for them.

108
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:16,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Noobisoft was what I heard somebody call them this week, and I thought that was really funny for some reason.

109
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

110
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:17,580
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

111
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,141
[SPEAKER_02]: It made me laugh.

112
00:08:18,221 --> 00:08:19,422
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Ubisoft.

113
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:20,082
[SPEAKER_02]: I do, too.

114
00:08:20,483 --> 00:08:21,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Except, didn't they do...

115
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,972
[SPEAKER_02]: That DDR urban game.

116
00:08:25,253 --> 00:08:25,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Flow?

117
00:08:25,753 --> 00:08:26,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Flow.

118
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:27,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Flow was kind of cool.

119
00:08:27,835 --> 00:08:28,355
[SPEAKER_02]: I played it.

120
00:08:28,695 --> 00:08:29,416
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't that bad.

121
00:08:29,496 --> 00:08:33,859
[SPEAKER_03]: It was not a great game, but it's way better than, like, I don't know, In the Groove.

122
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:35,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Except for a couple songs.

123
00:08:35,961 --> 00:08:38,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Sephiroth1215, what do you think of this comment in our chatroom?

124
00:08:38,663 --> 00:08:40,384
[SPEAKER_03]: I ignored it, is what I thought about it.

125
00:08:40,424 --> 00:08:41,325
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I have to read it here.

126
00:08:41,345 --> 00:08:45,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XI should have been called Final Fantasy Online and not by a number.

127
00:08:45,888 --> 00:08:48,010
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually said that when the game first came out.

128
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,312
[SPEAKER_02]: As much as I love Final Fantasy XI, I actually agree.

129
00:08:50,692 --> 00:08:52,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Dragon Quest VIII Dragon Quest VIII Dragon Quest VIII

130
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:17,898
[SPEAKER_02]: In response to Jeremy Todd's comment about how it's ironic that a couple weeks ago I said I wasn't a gamer, I'm still not.

131
00:09:17,918 --> 00:09:19,459
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just, you know, I've got a bad addiction.

132
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:20,679
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, I need help.

133
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,000
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

134
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,661
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it.

135
00:09:36,801 --> 00:09:38,282
[SPEAKER_02]: JeremyTal1 in chat is also pointing.

136
00:09:38,302 --> 00:09:40,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Boy, you'd think he's the only one in chat with how much we're quoting him tonight.

137
00:09:41,064 --> 00:09:46,368
[SPEAKER_02]: He's saying that Ubisoft is also making Assassin's Creed, which was some news this week because, you know, it's coming out to the 360.

138
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:47,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Shock and awe.

139
00:09:48,049 --> 00:09:48,650
[SPEAKER_02]: We all knew that.

140
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that was, like, totally unexpected.

141
00:09:51,252 --> 00:09:51,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

142
00:09:52,013 --> 00:09:52,873
[SPEAKER_02]: It came out of nowhere.

143
00:09:54,534 --> 00:09:54,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

144
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:55,575
[SPEAKER_02]: MyGamingWeek.

145
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:56,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

146
00:09:56,943 --> 00:09:58,504
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

147
00:10:11,874 --> 00:10:12,975
[SPEAKER_02]: I am an enabler.

148
00:10:12,995 --> 00:10:14,136
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really, really good at that stuff.

149
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:15,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you not see my cute little chocobo?

150
00:10:15,217 --> 00:10:15,837
[SPEAKER_03]: He's so awesome.

151
00:10:15,857 --> 00:10:16,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's cute.

152
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:17,058
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why you guys buy Macs, too.

153
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:20,001
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of our Link Shell buddies today put it best, though.

154
00:10:20,021 --> 00:10:20,782
[SPEAKER_02]: He said something about,

155
00:10:38,683 --> 00:10:41,404
[SPEAKER_02]: We were all looking at the total time spent in the game.

156
00:10:42,004 --> 00:10:45,345
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, Jazz, he's up to 198 days in the game.

157
00:10:46,005 --> 00:10:46,985
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he's crazy.

158
00:10:47,025 --> 00:10:50,006
[SPEAKER_02]: And he says probably a quarter of that has been spent looking for party.

159
00:10:50,606 --> 00:10:53,226
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is the downside to Final Fantasy XI, big time.

160
00:10:53,266 --> 00:10:58,287
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have a good link shell so that you have a chat room to keep you busy.

161
00:10:58,347 --> 00:11:01,308
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, honestly, I missed a lot of the people in the chat room.

162
00:11:02,808 --> 00:11:04,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat room, the link shell on Final Fantasy XI, so...

163
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:07,190
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's a good reason to come back.

164
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:10,331
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fact that I was playing the game is a good reason to come back.

165
00:11:10,952 --> 00:11:15,334
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know that doing all that crap last night to get you those quests was really fun, too.

166
00:11:15,434 --> 00:11:16,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we did all the new job quests.

167
00:11:16,814 --> 00:11:20,336
[SPEAKER_02]: I got Blue Mage, Corsair, and Puppeteer all in one night, and it was actually kind of fun.

168
00:11:20,716 --> 00:11:21,817
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say this about the game, though.

169
00:11:21,857 --> 00:11:23,778
[SPEAKER_02]: They upped the graphics on Xbox 360.

170
00:11:23,818 --> 00:11:24,638
[SPEAKER_02]: They upped the resolution.

171
00:11:24,678 --> 00:11:25,779
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a slight change.

172
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:29,841
[SPEAKER_02]: You may not even notice it, but I did, and I think it did make the game look a little better.

173
00:11:29,921 --> 00:11:31,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Still kind of hard to read the text.

174
00:11:32,242 --> 00:11:34,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Still takes forever to get logged into the game, but...

175
00:11:35,103 --> 00:11:35,584
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm having a good time

176
00:11:58,232 --> 00:12:05,502
[SPEAKER_02]: A. I will still be going to Phantasy Star Universe when that comes out, so Final Fantasy XI can kiss my butt while I go play Phantasy Star Universe for a while.

177
00:12:06,122 --> 00:12:11,009
[SPEAKER_02]: B. Did you hear me complain the 40 times she went back to Ragnarok Online?

178
00:12:11,109 --> 00:12:11,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't think so.

179
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,633
[SPEAKER_02]: She quit and went back to WoW as well, so you know what?

180
00:12:14,673 --> 00:12:15,614
[SPEAKER_02]: We all have our things.

181
00:12:16,676 --> 00:12:17,617
[SPEAKER_02]: So, suck it.

182
00:12:17,717 --> 00:12:19,158
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care what you people think.

183
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:20,378
[SPEAKER_02]: I will game however I want.

184
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:22,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Other games I've been playing this week.

185
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Another game that I bought that a lot of people have been going, why would you buy that?

186
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:27,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Time Pilot on Xbox Live Arcade.

187
00:12:27,923 --> 00:12:30,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Now look, this was one of my favorite 80s games.

188
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it was kind of like my cultish game that I really liked.

189
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:34,847
[SPEAKER_02]: That and Gyruss.

190
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:37,028
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they're both Konami games, just by coincidence.

191
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are like the shooters that I absolutely love.

192
00:12:39,096 --> 00:12:42,457
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was really excited to see Time Pilot was coming out to the Xbox 360.

193
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:45,499
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool you can play with original graphics as well as enhanced.

194
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,141
[SPEAKER_02]: The enhanced graphics aren't exactly going to, you know, rock your world by any means.

195
00:12:51,221 --> 00:12:55,743
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably Super Nintendo-level graphics, but I mean, I guess it's kind of nice to have them.

196
00:12:56,283 --> 00:12:58,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, the game has super easy achievements.

197
00:12:59,324 --> 00:13:05,647
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably got about eight achievements the first time I played through the game, but maybe that's just because I played it before, so I kind of, you know, was already decent at it.

198
00:13:07,466 --> 00:13:10,288
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't think there's going to be a lot here that's going to win a person over.

199
00:13:10,328 --> 00:13:10,628
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's $5.

200
00:13:11,569 --> 00:13:12,389
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that expensive.

201
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:13,991
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say check out the demo.

202
00:13:14,491 --> 00:13:22,997
[SPEAKER_02]: If you like those Geometry Wars-ish shooting games and you want another easy-to-pick-up shooter, or you're an achievement points whore, I think Time Pilot's pretty decent.

203
00:13:23,257 --> 00:13:24,037
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's worth a look.

204
00:13:24,918 --> 00:13:28,620
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the game that they're putting out next week, though, Scramble, I think I'm going to totally pass on that one.

205
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,862
[SPEAKER_02]: That was not a Konami game, I remember, by any means.

206
00:13:31,322 --> 00:13:34,384
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Gradius should have been the one we're getting instead, but that's just me.

207
00:13:34,524 --> 00:13:35,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they're waiting on that one.

208
00:13:35,505 --> 00:13:35,805
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

209
00:13:36,286 --> 00:13:36,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

210
00:13:38,376 --> 00:13:40,520
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other game I played this week was Enchanted Arms.

211
00:13:41,262 --> 00:13:42,605
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't like the game at first.

212
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:44,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's not that I didn't like it.

213
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:47,074
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was just like a real average RPG.

214
00:13:47,114 --> 00:13:49,479
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was kind of like, okay, am I only liking this because...

215
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,253
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

216
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:18,694
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's as good as it could be, but I think a lot of the cutscenes are really, really good.

217
00:14:18,755 --> 00:14:20,817
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of the battle, though, looks like PlayStation 2.

218
00:14:21,137 --> 00:14:22,679
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the graphic stuff annoys me.

219
00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:27,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if you use big characters in your party, sometimes it blocks other characters.

220
00:14:27,424 --> 00:14:28,185
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't even see them.

221
00:14:28,546 --> 00:14:32,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Some very basic camera controls could have been put into battle to make it a lot easier to see.

222
00:14:33,849 --> 00:14:35,249
[SPEAKER_02]: English Voice Acting English Voice Acting

223
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

224
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:41,250
[SPEAKER_02]: basically you move around a 12 square grid and put in your attacks and you kind of have to think about where your characters are positioned might make it easier for the enemy to attack you so it's somewhat tactical but still old fashioned style as well there's a lot of customization ability kind of has a Pokemon-ish element in it because there's a hundred different golem creatures you can use the story started off very cliche and it's still a little bit cliche as far as Japanese RPGs go but it's getting better I find that if you stay with the game

225
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:50,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Up until about, there's a major event that happens about two hours into the game that has a really gorgeous cutscene with it, and I think the game gets a lot better after that point.

226
00:15:50,855 --> 00:15:55,578
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to ask this, though, because I am a gay gamer, and Miklatov, I know you are too.

227
00:15:56,138 --> 00:16:05,263
[SPEAKER_02]: The game's getting a lot of talk because it has a gay character in it named Makoto, and Makoto is very, let's say, flamboyant.

228
00:16:05,484 --> 00:16:09,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine Carson, the blonde guy from Queer Eye, who's like a bard character.

229
00:16:09,406 --> 00:16:11,267
[SPEAKER_02]: He plays sax or something, and

230
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,411
[SPEAKER_02]: He talks like this.

231
00:16:13,451 --> 00:16:18,154
[SPEAKER_02]: He talks like James from Pokemon, if you've ever watched that show.

232
00:16:18,554 --> 00:16:19,335
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, wow.

233
00:16:19,355 --> 00:16:19,955
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he doesn't.

234
00:16:19,975 --> 00:16:20,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, he does.

235
00:16:20,676 --> 00:16:21,556
[SPEAKER_02]: He totally has a voice.

236
00:16:21,636 --> 00:16:24,358
[SPEAKER_03]: If anything, he talks more like Xander from Drawn Together.

237
00:16:24,658 --> 00:16:25,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, what do you think of this?

238
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:28,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it's a good thing for gay gamers?

239
00:16:28,761 --> 00:16:30,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it sets us back two years?

240
00:16:30,642 --> 00:16:31,123
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?

241
00:16:31,143 --> 00:16:32,023
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a bad thing.

242
00:16:32,384 --> 00:16:38,768
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't like him, but I like how they're...

243
00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:41,331
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

244
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:09,548
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not one way or the other.

245
00:17:09,788 --> 00:17:26,935
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's very interesting and a very risky thing to do in an Xbox 360 game, because you think of the typical, stereotypical Xbox audience, Madden 07 and all that stuff, and I think it would be very shocking, and I can imagine a lot of people going, ew, ew, ew, gross, but I think they need that.

246
00:17:27,615 --> 00:17:28,576
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they need that.

247
00:17:28,636 --> 00:17:28,956
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

248
00:17:29,756 --> 00:17:30,977
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's kind of neat.

249
00:17:33,073 --> 00:17:38,535
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a step in the right direction, even if the character was done a little over the top, to put it lightly.

250
00:17:39,155 --> 00:17:40,316
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a good thing, overall.

251
00:17:41,576 --> 00:17:44,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I do a spoiler?

252
00:17:44,517 --> 00:17:44,677
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

253
00:17:45,137 --> 00:17:45,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Jerk.

254
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Blaze in our chatroom says, that's how the world should be.

255
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:49,519
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.

256
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:53,072
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, maybe it's a utopia view of the world.

257
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:53,453
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

258
00:17:53,633 --> 00:17:55,955
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, those are the games I've been playing this week.

259
00:17:56,435 --> 00:17:58,877
[SPEAKER_02]: I do kind of recommend Enchanted Arms.

260
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:04,221
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if you're into Japanese RPGs and you own an Xbox 360, you really should take a look at this game.

261
00:18:04,582 --> 00:18:08,525
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you haven't really played these types of games before, I don't think this is the one that's going to win you over.

262
00:18:08,865 --> 00:18:12,508
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think this is a good one to appease fans of Japanese RPGs.

263
00:18:13,649 --> 00:18:16,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's get into some housekeeping news tonight.

264
00:18:17,232 --> 00:18:17,712
[SPEAKER_02]: First off...

265
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:22,865
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some of you folks might be listening tonight for the DDR Power Previews, which we were promoting.

266
00:18:22,905 --> 00:18:29,966
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you've noticed on OrangeLawnTrader.com, we were requested earlier this week by Konami to suspend that for the time being.

267
00:18:30,006 --> 00:18:33,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Some things are going on behind the scenes where they just weren't ready for us to do that.

268
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:41,689
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're hoping that, and I don't know why, there's a million reasons we can theorize, but long story short, it's just not happening tonight.

269
00:18:42,472 --> 00:18:49,094
[SPEAKER_02]: The good news is it does look like we will be getting to debut some type of new tracks from Ultramix 4 and Universe.

270
00:18:49,814 --> 00:18:52,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Konami of Hawaii has been really good in working with us.

271
00:18:52,655 --> 00:18:56,156
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we will have something possibly as soon as next week.

272
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,636
[SPEAKER_02]: So keep your eyes peeled on the website.

273
00:18:57,716 --> 00:19:00,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think it's going to happen in one form or another.

274
00:19:00,177 --> 00:19:05,578
[SPEAKER_02]: And you will hear new songs that you have not heard yet here on Orange Launch Radio and over on allgames.com.

275
00:19:05,658 --> 00:19:06,679
[SPEAKER_02]: So stay tuned to the website.

276
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:10,140
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize for anyone that was tuning in ready to hear it tonight.

277
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,120
[SPEAKER_02]: These things happen.

278
00:19:11,564 --> 00:19:12,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Other housekeeping news.

279
00:19:12,745 --> 00:19:13,425
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a 3 day weekend.

280
00:19:37,865 --> 00:19:42,379
[SPEAKER_02]: and uh... if you've been in our chat room tonight you'll know that Loki and myself have started the drinking tonight

281
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:45,600
[SPEAKER_02]: A few things I want to say about drunk shows.

282
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:52,402
[SPEAKER_02]: A, we do this because we can, because people out there say, oh, professionals shouldn't drink while we're on the job.

283
00:19:52,422 --> 00:19:56,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're not professionals, and we're perfectly fine with that, so shove it.

284
00:19:56,543 --> 00:20:00,204
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing is that people say, wait a minute, Rob, aren't you being a little bit of a hypocrite?

285
00:20:00,244 --> 00:20:06,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Because last week you were saying you were criticizing those folks that had gone to the press event and were drinking at the press event.

286
00:20:06,226 --> 00:20:07,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's a big difference here, you see.

287
00:20:08,127 --> 00:20:10,288
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because they were drinking in someone else's house.

288
00:20:10,988 --> 00:20:17,394
[SPEAKER_02]: If we were guests on, let's say, Scott's show, Bobby's show, whatever podcast we want to have us on, Loki, do you think we'd go on their show drunk?

289
00:20:17,794 --> 00:20:19,396
[SPEAKER_02]: No, unless they were doing it.

290
00:20:19,476 --> 00:20:20,497
[SPEAKER_02]: No, unless they asked us to.

291
00:20:20,917 --> 00:20:24,901
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, we would probably not do that.

292
00:20:25,021 --> 00:20:27,864
[SPEAKER_02]: We would have the respect to be our professional self.

293
00:20:28,084 --> 00:20:30,566
[SPEAKER_02]: But while we're in our own house, we can do whatever we want.

294
00:20:31,007 --> 00:20:32,108
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the difference.

295
00:20:33,603 --> 00:20:35,885
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to call us a hypocrite after hearing that, whatever, I don't care.

296
00:20:55,075 --> 00:20:55,856
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

297
00:21:18,733 --> 00:21:26,818
[SPEAKER_01]: All I drink, for those who don't know, is screwdrivers, except tonight I've actually switched with Rob, he's drinking screwdrivers and I'm drinking some watermelon thing.

298
00:21:27,999 --> 00:21:34,203
[SPEAKER_01]: Even that is pretty tough for me to drink, and it's just all mental right now, so I'm not trying to overdo it at all.

299
00:21:34,603 --> 00:21:39,146
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I'm pretty sure I'm probably not going to get too drunk tonight, so whatever, I mean.

300
00:21:41,329 --> 00:21:42,290
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

301
00:22:02,103 --> 00:22:05,344
[SPEAKER_02]: I've just known people who've had a problem in my past, and it's not an easy thing to deal with.

302
00:22:05,364 --> 00:22:10,205
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the other thing I was thinking about bringing over, but I didn't, I was going to get drunk off a kosher wine.

303
00:22:10,385 --> 00:22:11,365
[SPEAKER_01]: Which would have been funny.

304
00:22:11,565 --> 00:22:12,245
[SPEAKER_01]: That would have been funny.

305
00:22:12,926 --> 00:22:13,226
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

306
00:22:13,846 --> 00:22:17,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, let's get into some gaming news, shall we?

307
00:22:17,727 --> 00:22:18,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we shall.

308
00:22:18,727 --> 00:22:20,547
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have some exclusives tonight, right, Loki?

309
00:22:20,588 --> 00:22:21,548
[SPEAKER_02]: We have lots of stuff.

310
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:22,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

311
00:22:22,088 --> 00:22:22,568
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened?

312
00:22:22,608 --> 00:22:24,228
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you land so many exclusives this week?

313
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:30,850
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, once a year, and actually we started this last year, we have the game publishers out to basically give us their rundown of the fourth quarter.

314
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:32,949
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

315
00:22:51,388 --> 00:22:55,911
[SPEAKER_01]: So, starting things off here, which is actually kind of cool.

316
00:22:56,332 --> 00:22:58,313
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, for the first time, we had Nintendo come out.

317
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:03,477
[SPEAKER_01]: So, obviously, the question on everyone's mind, when the hell is Wii coming out?

318
00:23:03,517 --> 00:23:04,037
[SPEAKER_01]: When is this coming out?

319
00:23:04,418 --> 00:23:08,080
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be honest, the guy was very tight-lipped about it, except for a few things.

320
00:23:09,932 --> 00:23:13,014
[SPEAKER_01]: It is most definitely going to be announced on the 14th.

321
00:23:13,294 --> 00:23:21,200
[SPEAKER_01]: He said it's actually going to be announced in Japan as well at the same time, which is kind of funny because the news story came out afterwards about that same.

322
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,142
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say it lines up with a story that came out later this week.

323
00:23:24,162 --> 00:23:27,865
[SPEAKER_02]: He said they're going to have multi-regional press events, so that makes sense.

324
00:23:28,545 --> 00:23:31,067
[SPEAKER_01]: He has confirmed, though, it is going to be a November launch.

325
00:23:31,467 --> 00:23:33,649
[SPEAKER_01]: He said 100% a November launch.

326
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:36,589
[SPEAKER_01]: This is based on his knowledge, what he knows so far.

327
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:37,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Ouch.

328
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:41,212
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the October 18th date that we were so certain of just got shot down this week.

329
00:23:41,933 --> 00:23:42,593
[SPEAKER_02]: What went wrong?

330
00:23:42,834 --> 00:23:44,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Why were we wrong on October 18th?

331
00:23:44,335 --> 00:23:49,758
[SPEAKER_01]: We were wrong because the launch right now, he doesn't know exactly when it is.

332
00:23:49,978 --> 00:23:55,242
[SPEAKER_01]: It's November, but they're trying to time it either two weeks before the PS3 launch or a week after.

333
00:23:55,482 --> 00:23:58,684
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they don't want their thunder being stolen by Sony.

334
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:00,285
[SPEAKER_01]: So, wait, wait, wait.

335
00:24:00,465 --> 00:24:04,488
[SPEAKER_02]: You're telling me Nintendo themselves doesn't even know when they're launching this system as of yet.

336
00:24:05,089 --> 00:24:08,151
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he hasn't been told the final date yet.

337
00:24:08,352 --> 00:24:11,515
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why is they're waiting on the amount of units that they have in production.

338
00:24:11,555 --> 00:24:15,098
[SPEAKER_01]: They're making sure that they have enough to launch because they're doing a worldwide launch.

339
00:24:15,698 --> 00:24:17,140
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's pretty much it.

340
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,944
[SPEAKER_01]: But it will not delay the launch past Thanksgiving.

341
00:24:22,565 --> 00:24:24,246
[SPEAKER_01]: So it will be before...

342
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,451
[SPEAKER_01]: That gives you a pretty good range there of when it's going to be.

343
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:38,415
[SPEAKER_02]: So if Nintendo themselves doesn't even know the launch date, or at least maybe a very, very few select people know it at this point inside Nintendo, would it be safe to say that any story you've read on the internet about launch date today is bullshit?

344
00:24:38,995 --> 00:24:40,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Including the one we ran.

345
00:24:40,455 --> 00:24:40,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

346
00:24:41,235 --> 00:24:41,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

347
00:24:42,076 --> 00:24:46,137
[SPEAKER_01]: And remember, mine was just purely speculation because of the anniversary and all that stuff.

348
00:24:46,157 --> 00:24:50,859
[SPEAKER_02]: But that would make sense because if Nintendo themselves has kind of not really known the date they wanted to do...

349
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:52,932
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

350
00:25:07,951 --> 00:25:10,354
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be honest, I would think that they're not launching in November.

351
00:25:10,434 --> 00:25:16,640
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes sense because you want to make sure you have the most units so you can sell as much as possible so you don't run into the shortages.

352
00:25:17,321 --> 00:25:18,442
[SPEAKER_01]: Some interesting stuff, though.

353
00:25:18,482 --> 00:25:21,105
[SPEAKER_01]: They are spending $30 million in marketing this thing.

354
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:22,827
[SPEAKER_01]: That's twice as much as the GameCube.

355
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:25,230
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's definitely going to be out there.

356
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:31,738
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to have in-store kiosks because the reason why they're not is because of the setup issues with this thing.

357
00:25:32,118 --> 00:25:37,966
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it has that sensor bar, it would make it very difficult for them to be able to set up and they want to make sure that they have

358
00:25:38,376 --> 00:25:39,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

359
00:25:57,066 --> 00:25:58,107
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

360
00:26:17,288 --> 00:26:18,529
[SPEAKER_01]: There is one interesting thing.

361
00:26:18,589 --> 00:26:21,210
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going the Xbox route with the DVD player in it.

362
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:24,111
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be an add-on and not included in the box.

363
00:26:24,211 --> 00:26:29,073
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got to get this extra dongle or whatever to put on it to be able to play DVDs.

364
00:26:29,173 --> 00:26:33,495
[SPEAKER_01]: But his thought on it was, who doesn't own a DVD player by now?

365
00:26:33,655 --> 00:26:35,735
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, seriously, everybody owns a DVD player.

366
00:26:35,835 --> 00:26:36,496
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a big deal.

367
00:26:36,616 --> 00:26:39,217
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of neat.

368
00:26:39,637 --> 00:26:41,578
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving on from Nintendo a little bit...

369
00:26:43,783 --> 00:26:44,303
[SPEAKER_01]: to Midway.

370
00:26:44,683 --> 00:26:45,944
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was kind of interesting.

371
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:49,225
[SPEAKER_01]: Has that DVD player rumor been announced anywhere?

372
00:26:49,385 --> 00:26:49,725
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

373
00:26:50,345 --> 00:26:50,725
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

374
00:26:51,305 --> 00:26:52,986
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's something interesting from Midway.

375
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:55,147
[SPEAKER_01]: And I asked him twice when I heard this.

376
00:26:55,787 --> 00:26:58,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Blitz the League for the Wii is not coming out.

377
00:26:58,668 --> 00:26:59,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Not coming.

378
00:26:59,588 --> 00:27:00,168
[SPEAKER_01]: Not happening.

379
00:27:00,288 --> 00:27:01,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely not at launch.

380
00:27:01,749 --> 00:27:03,789
[SPEAKER_01]: It is cancelled as far as they're concerned.

381
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:05,230
[SPEAKER_01]: So, not happening.

382
00:27:07,151 --> 00:27:09,891
[SPEAKER_01]: They are basically concerned with launching Rampage.

383
00:27:09,931 --> 00:27:11,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Rampage, I guess, is going to be their big...

384
00:27:12,307 --> 00:27:12,788
[SPEAKER_01]: ActaVision

385
00:27:28,495 --> 00:27:31,197
[SPEAKER_01]: Guitar Hero 2 will be coming with a red guitar controller

386
00:27:57,418 --> 00:28:02,724
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, and I have asked him twice about this, because this didn't make sense, and I don't know, Shane, if you know anything about this.

387
00:28:03,144 --> 00:28:10,693
[SPEAKER_01]: He said that for Universe, all the songpacks from the Ultramix series will be transferable to Universe.

388
00:28:14,521 --> 00:28:15,761
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never heard that.

389
00:28:16,262 --> 00:28:19,264
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was interesting because I asked, I'm like, are you sure?

390
00:28:19,284 --> 00:28:20,465
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, how would that be possible?

391
00:28:20,925 --> 00:28:21,365
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

392
00:28:21,445 --> 00:28:22,386
[SPEAKER_01]: That didn't make any sense to me.

393
00:28:22,546 --> 00:28:26,349
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking this guy might have been confusing Ultramix 4 because that would make sense.

394
00:28:26,989 --> 00:28:30,591
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, like maybe Ultramix 4 and Universe have the same songpacks or something.

395
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:31,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

396
00:28:31,252 --> 00:28:33,713
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they're going to have the same soundpacks later on.

397
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:36,015
[SPEAKER_01]: But I asked him again, I'm like, are you sure?

398
00:28:36,315 --> 00:28:37,476
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, that seemed a little weird.

399
00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:41,319
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, yes, Universe will be able to play the songpacks from Ultramix.

400
00:28:41,639 --> 00:28:41,859
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like,

401
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so take that with a grain of salt.

402
00:28:45,201 --> 00:28:48,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, DarkSakura brings up a good point in chatroom.

403
00:28:48,262 --> 00:28:51,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultramix 1 through 4 aren't on the backward compatibility list, so how would that work?

404
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:52,564
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

405
00:28:53,105 --> 00:28:55,646
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless they're planning on re-releasing the songpacks or something?

406
00:28:55,946 --> 00:28:58,307
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

407
00:28:58,327 --> 00:28:58,608
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

408
00:29:01,409 --> 00:29:04,731
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, let's see here.

409
00:29:05,671 --> 00:29:07,152
[SPEAKER_01]: According to Sega...

410
00:29:08,308 --> 00:29:13,295
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantasy Star Universe, on the 360 there will be no charge for the online service, which is pretty good.

411
00:29:14,017 --> 00:29:17,562
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be a charge, a monthly fee for PlayStation 2 and PC users.

412
00:29:19,302 --> 00:29:24,164
[SPEAKER_03]: It would almost be worth it for me to get a 360 again just to get PSU with no monthly charge.

413
00:29:25,705 --> 00:29:30,348
[SPEAKER_01]: The Secret of the Rings, or you might remember Sonic Wildfire, not a launch title for the Wii.

414
00:29:30,528 --> 00:29:34,090
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming March 2007, so look for that then.

415
00:29:35,111 --> 00:29:38,873
[SPEAKER_01]: There will not be Full Auto 2 on the Xbox 360 at all.

416
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:42,395
[SPEAKER_01]: Not later, not ever.

417
00:29:42,535 --> 00:29:45,756
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the first one didn't sell very well, so they're not bringing it back.

418
00:29:46,137 --> 00:29:46,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh.

419
00:29:48,998 --> 00:29:52,380
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder why they think that it'll sell on the PS3.

420
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,221
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're not sure.

421
00:29:53,241 --> 00:29:54,521
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just trying a different audience.

422
00:29:54,742 --> 00:29:56,523
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really what it is.

423
00:29:56,983 --> 00:30:06,289
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really weird because, I mean, in the scope of about five minutes, you've contradicted about seven different news stories that have ran out there previously.

424
00:30:06,909 --> 00:30:07,209
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

425
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,030
[SPEAKER_02]: What can I say?

426
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:08,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

427
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,772
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you're right or we're going to look stupid.

428
00:30:11,752 --> 00:30:15,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, these are from the... Okay, so marketing people could be wrong and therefore you're wrong.

429
00:30:16,255 --> 00:30:17,036
[SPEAKER_01]: LucasArts

430
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:31,189
[SPEAKER_01]: The Wii Star Wars game is in development.

431
00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:33,430
[SPEAKER_01]: It will not be done until late 2007 or early 2008.

432
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:38,351
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to make sure they get it right because they have a rabid fan base of Star Wars fans.

433
00:30:39,451 --> 00:30:41,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, they mix it with rabid Wii fans.

434
00:30:42,332 --> 00:30:45,832
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to make sure they don't fuck this up, so that's mainly the case.

435
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:50,473
[SPEAKER_01]: The next-gen Star Wars game is going to be coming in the fall of 2007.

436
00:30:50,593 --> 00:30:54,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, Indiana Jones, the next-gen game, will be released at the same time as the new movie.

437
00:30:55,214 --> 00:30:57,996
[SPEAKER_01]: which is confirmed in pre-production from them.

438
00:31:00,357 --> 00:31:01,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see here.

439
00:31:02,018 --> 00:31:13,746
[SPEAKER_01]: I had Vimvedi, they were talking about the Scarface game and one of the funny bits of trivia from it is that the voice actor that they picked for Tony Montana is actually Al Pacino's driver.

440
00:31:14,986 --> 00:31:19,009
[SPEAKER_01]: And apparently because Al Pacino can't do Tony's voice anymore due to his age,

441
00:31:19,642 --> 00:31:20,884
[SPEAKER_01]: Say hello to my little friend!

442
00:31:30,946 --> 00:31:35,409
[SPEAKER_01]: GT, that racing game that they announced, it's going to come with a steering wheel add-on for the Wii.

443
00:31:35,849 --> 00:31:39,172
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is going to be something that you plug... Like you put the Wii controller in the middle of it?

444
00:31:39,252 --> 00:31:39,652
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you do.

445
00:31:39,672 --> 00:31:40,412
[SPEAKER_01]: That is hot.

446
00:31:40,552 --> 00:31:42,794
[SPEAKER_01]: That is awesome.

447
00:31:42,974 --> 00:31:44,055
[SPEAKER_01]: You do not need it to play.

448
00:31:44,075 --> 00:31:45,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Could I use the A button for the horn?

449
00:31:46,076 --> 00:31:46,516
[SPEAKER_01]: Beep, beep.

450
00:31:47,397 --> 00:31:54,501
[SPEAKER_01]: You do not need it to play the game, but it will be just something that you can slap the controller into to play it, which I thought that was very cool.

451
00:31:55,182 --> 00:31:57,463
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone actually thinking about how to use the system.

452
00:31:58,084 --> 00:31:58,164
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

453
00:31:58,993 --> 00:32:00,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Prince of Persia New Chariot Races

454
00:32:10,342 --> 00:32:14,307
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now the working title is just Prince of Persia, so they haven't really made an announcement yet.

455
00:32:14,467 --> 00:32:19,012
[SPEAKER_01]: Now for once, that lines up with something I did read on the rest of the internet a couple weeks ago.

456
00:32:19,473 --> 00:32:21,796
[SPEAKER_01]: That was actually the DS one that you were reading about, I think.

457
00:32:22,697 --> 00:32:25,580
[SPEAKER_01]: Far Cry and the Wii looks pretty awesome from what I've seen so far.

458
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:29,505
[SPEAKER_01]: The pictures look pretty cool, the screenshots, so that was pretty neat.

459
00:32:29,745 --> 00:32:30,045
[SPEAKER_01]: Koei.

460
00:32:30,987 --> 00:32:33,749
[SPEAKER_01]: Bladestorm, The Hundred Years War, not coming out at launch.

461
00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:39,253
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be quarter one of 2007, and I guess it is in the launch window, but whatever.

462
00:32:39,694 --> 00:32:43,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Guitar-O-Man Lives is going to have online play and new songs.

463
00:32:43,557 --> 00:32:43,977
[SPEAKER_01]: That's hot.

464
00:32:45,218 --> 00:32:46,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't that already come out?

465
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,661
[SPEAKER_01]: In Europe?

466
00:32:48,701 --> 00:32:51,043
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe in Europe, I don't know, but it's coming out October here.

467
00:32:52,283 --> 00:32:58,068
[SPEAKER_01]: New Romance of the Three Kingdoms game coming out on the PlayStation 2, quarter one or quarter two of 2007, which should be interesting.

468
00:32:59,141 --> 00:32:59,701
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the big one.

469
00:33:00,121 --> 00:33:00,962
[SPEAKER_01]: Microsoft.

470
00:33:01,762 --> 00:33:05,063
[SPEAKER_01]: No price drops, no bundles whatsoever for the 360.

471
00:33:05,103 --> 00:33:09,164
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not worried because their competition is $200 more expensive than them.

472
00:33:09,244 --> 00:33:17,787
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, they were unaware that Canada, because Canada kind of operates a little bit independent than the U.S., Microsoft was doing a bundle until after it had been announced.

473
00:33:18,447 --> 00:33:21,468
[SPEAKER_01]: And much hate mail was exchanged, according to our rep.

474
00:33:22,388 --> 00:33:25,429
[SPEAKER_01]: Gears of War is coming out November 7th, not November 12th.

475
00:33:25,509 --> 00:33:28,910
[SPEAKER_01]: November 12th is actually Emergency, which is their big marketing push.

476
00:33:32,127 --> 00:33:34,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, that makes absolutely no sense at all.

477
00:33:34,548 --> 00:33:40,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would they have all this huge hype over emergency, emergency, and then you're telling me the game's coming out five days earlier?

478
00:33:40,731 --> 00:33:44,413
[SPEAKER_01]: The game is coming out on the 7th because you can't really launch a game on a Wednesday.

479
00:33:44,453 --> 00:33:47,094
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when everybody's getting in the game is on the 7th.

480
00:33:47,574 --> 00:33:52,377
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, stores, you know, some stores are waiting until the 12th because they're confused on this emergency thing.

481
00:33:53,117 --> 00:33:57,899
[SPEAKER_01]: But the emergency is when they're going to be doing all the big ad pushes, you know, their campaigns.

482
00:33:58,019 --> 00:33:59,460
[SPEAKER_01]: They're playing with fame.

483
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Because didn't Halo launch on a Friday?

484
00:34:01,321 --> 00:34:05,962
[SPEAKER_01]: So could it be like that where maybe the stores are getting it that day, but they're not supposed to sell it until the 12th?

485
00:34:06,242 --> 00:34:08,183
[SPEAKER_01]: No, according to him, they can sell it when they get it.

486
00:34:08,623 --> 00:34:13,005
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was also kind of ties in with another story that we had earlier about the same thing.

487
00:34:13,525 --> 00:34:18,226
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can confirm that it's always been the 7th, but I thought it was weird that they were selling it on a Sunday.

488
00:34:20,007 --> 00:34:21,087
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the best one right here.

489
00:34:21,547 --> 00:34:22,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Halo 3.

490
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, everybody thinks it's coming out in the fall of 2007.

491
00:34:24,628 --> 00:34:24,668
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

492
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:27,650
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

493
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:54,093
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be March or April of 2007.

494
00:34:55,033 --> 00:34:56,013
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be the fall.

495
00:34:56,193 --> 00:34:58,474
[SPEAKER_01]: If I was a betting man, I'd say it's the end of spring.

496
00:34:59,734 --> 00:35:00,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, but you know what?

497
00:35:00,934 --> 00:35:02,334
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't sound like he knew for sure.

498
00:35:02,354 --> 00:35:04,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he says, if I was a betting man, I would da-da-da-da.

499
00:35:06,215 --> 00:35:11,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you launch a game in April, especially before E3 or whatever?

500
00:35:12,177 --> 00:35:14,277
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, here's my thought on it.

501
00:35:14,297 --> 00:35:16,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though E3 is the same thing next year.

502
00:35:17,098 --> 00:35:19,078
[SPEAKER_01]: This makes perfect sense when you think about it this way.

503
00:35:20,815 --> 00:35:21,976
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Not Sure About Microsoft

504
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,583
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

505
00:36:00,677 --> 00:36:03,260
[SPEAKER_01]: Atari, Alone in the Dark Test Drive Unlimited

506
00:36:17,574 --> 00:36:19,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is coming out actually next week.

507
00:36:19,335 --> 00:36:21,375
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be getting download packs each month.

508
00:36:21,816 --> 00:36:24,797
[SPEAKER_01]: They're planned up until June of next year so far.

509
00:36:25,577 --> 00:36:27,698
[SPEAKER_01]: The first two packs will be Lexus cars.

510
00:36:28,018 --> 00:36:29,418
[SPEAKER_01]: It says no word off these cars.

511
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:30,299
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be free.

512
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:34,360
[SPEAKER_01]: But Lexus paid a quarter million dollars to get the cars in the game.

513
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:41,142
[SPEAKER_01]: And it says all the download packs will range from free to $7.99 or the Microsoft equivalent in points.

514
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:44,504
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all the big news from our wonderful...

515
00:36:46,302 --> 00:36:46,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Meetings.

516
00:36:46,762 --> 00:36:48,743
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Nintendo Maniac 64 has a good point.

517
00:36:48,783 --> 00:36:49,863
[SPEAKER_02]: PSP came out in March.

518
00:36:51,164 --> 00:36:52,344
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the end of their fiscal year.

519
00:36:53,365 --> 00:36:56,386
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I would think that they would wait until the fall.

520
00:36:56,546 --> 00:37:00,827
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, maybe they want to make sure that people... Think about this.

521
00:37:02,007 --> 00:37:05,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Microsoft is doing something big around the PlayStation 3 launch.

522
00:37:05,709 --> 00:37:07,829
[SPEAKER_01]: Just some sort of announcement or event.

523
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,850
[SPEAKER_01]: What if that announcement is that Halo is coming out in March?

524
00:37:11,091 --> 00:37:15,152
[SPEAKER_01]: Then people that were going to buy PlayStation 3, they're going to wait until this game comes out.

525
00:37:17,008 --> 00:37:18,829
[SPEAKER_02]: That's... That's it.

526
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:19,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

527
00:37:21,411 --> 00:37:26,154
[SPEAKER_02]: So, maybe that's just the liquor talking, but that makes a lot of sense now that you've put it that way.

528
00:37:27,055 --> 00:37:32,358
[SPEAKER_02]: So, okay, would you say if November goes by and we still haven't heard anything that maybe something's up?

529
00:37:32,899 --> 00:37:39,643
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if they're going to announce anything, it's going to be a big... It's going to be... A Halo 3 announcement, I mean, is going to be huge, but... I don't know.

530
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:41,244
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it makes sense.

531
00:37:41,304 --> 00:37:45,267
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you would... Because people are like, well, there's... You know, Gears of War is awesome, but...

532
00:37:46,028 --> 00:37:46,749
[SPEAKER_01]: I really want Halo 3.

533
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:50,635
[SPEAKER_01]: I might be getting a PlayStation 3 because Resistance looks pretty good.

534
00:37:51,616 --> 00:37:53,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, by the way, Halo's coming out in a few months.

535
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:55,161
[SPEAKER_01]: People are like, okay, I can wait.

536
00:37:56,262 --> 00:37:58,125
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I'll buy a 360 now.

537
00:37:58,425 --> 00:37:58,966
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of thing.

538
00:37:59,947 --> 00:38:00,268
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

539
00:38:00,308 --> 00:38:02,331
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be just downright evil, but kind of funny.

540
00:38:03,482 --> 00:38:12,527
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, didn't they say that they were going to... Well, they always were saying that they were going to release Halo 3 on the... Yeah, but I think then everybody realized realistically that can't happen.

541
00:38:12,947 --> 00:38:14,408
[SPEAKER_01]: If Halo 3 is going to be really good.

542
00:38:14,748 --> 00:38:14,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

543
00:38:15,609 --> 00:38:15,929
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

544
00:38:15,989 --> 00:38:17,230
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, but... Alright, we'll see.

545
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,051
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know.

546
00:38:19,091 --> 00:38:23,593
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it with a grain of salt, but that's straight from the mouths of people that are working for these companies.

547
00:38:24,974 --> 00:38:27,936
[SPEAKER_02]: You know... Turbopunk in chat.

548
00:38:27,996 --> 00:38:28,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Pure evil.

549
00:38:28,836 --> 00:38:31,458
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd expect no less from Macroshaft.

550
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:33,199
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

551
00:38:34,048 --> 00:38:34,388
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

552
00:38:34,968 --> 00:38:35,709
[SPEAKER_01]: It was interesting.

553
00:38:35,749 --> 00:38:36,649
[SPEAKER_01]: We were very excited.

554
00:38:36,929 --> 00:38:39,190
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to get more out of the Microsoft guy.

555
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:41,671
[SPEAKER_01]: He kind of wanted to talk about stuff that had already come out.

556
00:38:41,691 --> 00:38:42,791
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

557
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:43,372
[SPEAKER_01]: He's weird.

558
00:38:44,472 --> 00:38:44,772
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

559
00:38:46,053 --> 00:38:47,233
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of juicy tidbits there.

560
00:38:47,253 --> 00:38:48,053
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see what happens.

561
00:38:48,073 --> 00:38:53,475
[SPEAKER_01]: We will post all this stuff in that thread that we have going, the Under the Radar thread.

562
00:38:53,536 --> 00:38:57,437
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll have that for reference in case this stuff actually... Or he's wrong.

563
00:38:57,457 --> 00:38:58,697
[SPEAKER_01]: Or he's downright wrong.

564
00:38:58,718 --> 00:38:59,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, whatever.

565
00:39:00,218 --> 00:39:01,759
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well, this is coming from salespeople.

566
00:39:01,879 --> 00:39:02,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, I mean...

567
00:39:02,819 --> 00:39:03,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sales?

568
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Sales people, yeah.

569
00:39:05,141 --> 00:39:13,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, one thing we do know about Xbox Live Arcade is that we have this new game that's going to be coming out, and it's called Space Giraffe.

570
00:39:14,187 --> 00:39:22,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, usually I'd laugh at a game called Space Giraffe, but what looks pretty awesome about it is that it looks a lot like Tempest, but a lot trippy, kind of like how Geometry Wars was.

571
00:39:23,373 --> 00:39:28,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I remember seeing a screenshot for this game that had a lot of really dirty words on it, but I can't seem to find that anymore.

572
00:39:28,916 --> 00:39:29,557
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that one, yeah.

573
00:39:29,697 --> 00:39:31,278
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that was photoshopped or what, but...

574
00:39:31,698 --> 00:39:31,918
[SPEAKER_02]: No?

575
00:39:31,938 --> 00:39:33,799
[SPEAKER_02]: That's disgusting.

576
00:39:33,859 --> 00:39:41,524
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope... Because there were some words in there that actually offended me, and that's hard to do, so hopefully those aren't actually in the game, but we'll see.

577
00:39:42,224 --> 00:39:42,985
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of interesting.

578
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:46,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there were some pictures posted on LiveJournal or something like that, so that would be pretty cool.

579
00:39:46,847 --> 00:39:47,627
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Tempest 2000.

580
00:39:48,087 --> 00:39:48,868
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's one of the, like,

581
00:39:49,557 --> 00:39:55,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Biggest Sleeper Hits that people don't appreciate and was like the reason to own a Jaguar was that game.

582
00:39:56,058 --> 00:39:57,499
[SPEAKER_02]: So, there you have it.

583
00:39:57,719 --> 00:40:01,239
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be very happy if a game like this came to Xbox Live Arcade more as it develops.

584
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:08,121
[SPEAKER_01]: There was also a story this week talking about the Xbox 360 soccer exclusive deals that they have going on.

585
00:40:08,461 --> 00:40:18,403
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking about how the Xbox 360 is going to be the only place that you're going to be able to get next-gen soccer games or all next-gen soccer games I should say because FIFA is going to be on both systems and

586
00:40:19,824 --> 00:40:22,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Pro Evolution Soccer 6 Winning 11 Pro Evolution Soccer 2007

587
00:40:33,656 --> 00:40:40,422
[SPEAKER_01]: According to Konami, who was also at our event this week, spoke to the rep there.

588
00:40:40,822 --> 00:40:55,735
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why Pro Evolution Soccer, or Winning Eleven, whatever, Pro Evolution Soccer 2007, the reason it's not coming out on the PlayStation 3 at launch is because they haven't got the final dev kits yet, and because the game's not getting done until March.

589
00:40:56,796 --> 00:40:59,358
[SPEAKER_01]: Or actually, as late as May, according to him.

590
00:41:00,439 --> 00:41:00,679
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

591
00:41:02,028 --> 00:41:04,753
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's only exclusive because it's not finished.

592
00:41:06,035 --> 00:41:07,758
[SPEAKER_01]: So, take it as you will, but...

593
00:41:08,888 --> 00:41:09,188
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

594
00:41:09,648 --> 00:41:09,869
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.

595
00:41:10,429 --> 00:41:10,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

596
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:20,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, one... I don't remember them saying anything at the barbecue about it being exclusive or anything, and I would have thought if it was going to be exclusive, they would have said something like that.

597
00:41:21,756 --> 00:41:27,620
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seemed like they were... I mean, the game was being ported to DS... What else was there?

598
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,380
[SPEAKER_02]: PSP.

599
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,862
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seemed like they were porting it to other systems anyway.

600
00:41:30,982 --> 00:41:34,584
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, sure, for the handhelds, they'd be downgraded versions, but... Well...

601
00:41:36,495 --> 00:41:44,400
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about it, if they didn't really assign an exclusive deal, and I'm not sure FIFA's coming out on the PlayStation 3, I would figure it is, but maybe not this year, I don't know.

602
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:59,270
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's the case, then there is no soccer game on the... Now, wait, okay, hold on a minute here, because the guy from Microsoft at the Germany convention went out there and said, we have both franchises exclusive.

603
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:01,851
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're saying, no.

604
00:42:02,592 --> 00:42:05,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, according to my rep, but then again, you know, he may be,

605
00:42:06,548 --> 00:42:07,149
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

606
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,754
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just taking Konami's word for it.

607
00:42:10,774 --> 00:42:11,375
[SPEAKER_01]: What can I say?

608
00:42:11,715 --> 00:42:12,136
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

609
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:13,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

610
00:42:13,618 --> 00:42:13,959
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

611
00:42:14,139 --> 00:42:14,820
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of weird.

612
00:42:15,831 --> 00:42:20,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's one game we know is not going to be exclusive to either system and shouldn't be a shock at all.

613
00:42:20,332 --> 00:42:21,753
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a Burnout 5 coming.

614
00:42:22,133 --> 00:42:22,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, really?

615
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:24,194
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that doesn't make any sense.

616
00:42:24,414 --> 00:42:29,495
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's coming to the 360 and the PlayStation 3, who would have thought, sometime in 2007.

617
00:42:29,795 --> 00:42:33,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Burnout is going to be getting a little bit of a makeover.

618
00:42:33,477 --> 00:42:35,837
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just going to be rehash of the old same old Burnout.

619
00:42:36,237 --> 00:42:37,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, EA.

620
00:42:38,098 --> 00:42:42,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this time Burnout will be more of an open-world-ish environment.

621
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:50,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Players will be able to go in and out of menus at every intersection, possibly a crash course by going through any type of intersection.

622
00:42:51,003 --> 00:42:53,624
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be taking place in a town called Paradise City.

623
00:42:54,424 --> 00:42:56,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Take me down to the Paradise City.

624
00:42:56,445 --> 00:42:57,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I just can't help but think of that song.

625
00:42:58,726 --> 00:43:00,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Why isn't it coming out for the Wii?

626
00:43:00,887 --> 00:43:01,287
[SPEAKER_02]: No ideas.

627
00:43:02,754 --> 00:43:03,535
[SPEAKER_02]: No ideas.

628
00:43:04,155 --> 00:43:08,938
[SPEAKER_02]: They also say, though, EA says, the most explosive pileups in the series history.

629
00:43:09,759 --> 00:43:11,460
[SPEAKER_01]: They're always going to say that.

630
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,042
[SPEAKER_02]: It is kind of the first true next-gen burnout.

631
00:43:14,062 --> 00:43:16,464
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the other one was just a souped-up old burnout.

632
00:43:16,964 --> 00:43:17,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much.

633
00:43:17,545 --> 00:43:19,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's not a big surprise there.

634
00:43:19,646 --> 00:43:24,630
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what's interesting, though, Microsoft Japan is talking about bringing Tokyo Game Show and Exo 6 home.

635
00:43:28,909 --> 00:43:44,457
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, kind of like, it sounds like what they're doing, or what they did with E3, how they had, you know, a bunch of exclusive, like, video and demos and stuff, and I really hope they do that, because, you know, with the region-free, uh, you know, those logins that we have, you can download some pretty cool demos.

636
00:43:44,977 --> 00:43:56,203
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, yeah, so there'll be, um, more of that stuff coming, um, around Tokyo Game Show, which is actually only in a few weeks, I mean, uh, 23rd to 24th of September, so, um, should be pretty cool.

637
00:43:59,266 --> 00:43:59,726
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on.

638
00:44:24,315 --> 00:44:28,638
[SPEAKER_02]: On This Day or Days because of the, you know, dateline and all that stuff, messing everything up.

639
00:44:29,438 --> 00:44:33,601
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, it kind of goes on into the Tokyo Game Show.

640
00:44:33,941 --> 00:44:37,403
[SPEAKER_02]: But what should be noted, Nintendo usually doesn't attend Tokyo Game Show.

641
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:42,126
[SPEAKER_02]: So this might be their way of kind of doing it on their own terms of publicity.

642
00:44:42,206 --> 00:44:43,507
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, not a big surprise.

643
00:44:44,447 --> 00:44:45,648
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not not a huge surprise.

644
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:50,655
[SPEAKER_01]: What was a pretty big surprise, though, was Microsoft released another backwards compatibility update.

645
00:44:51,275 --> 00:44:53,897
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was quite a few titles this time, actually.

646
00:44:54,177 --> 00:44:58,460
[SPEAKER_01]: They even had some pretty good stuff, like Burnout 3 and Dead the Rights.

647
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:02,623
[SPEAKER_01]: Right after I sold back Burnout 3, thank you, Microsoft.

648
00:45:02,663 --> 00:45:03,243
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

649
00:45:03,343 --> 00:45:10,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Fetal Frame 2, Freaky Flyers, if you were into that game, Gauntlet Seven Sorrows, Sid Meier's Pirates.

650
00:45:11,028 --> 00:45:12,229
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on and so forth.

651
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:40,587
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

652
00:46:09,063 --> 00:46:11,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Barbie fits the same scheme.

653
00:46:11,585 --> 00:46:12,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to old Nintendo emulators.

654
00:46:13,045 --> 00:46:16,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you make a certain mapper work, most of the other games that run on that mapper work.

655
00:46:16,828 --> 00:46:18,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, here's something interesting.

656
00:46:18,849 --> 00:46:25,192
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking actually with Midway about, hey, did you guys know that this game has got to add to the compatibility list today?

657
00:46:25,492 --> 00:46:29,495
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, no, I didn't hear that, but I'm not surprised.

658
00:46:29,695 --> 00:46:32,036
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, well, we actually know what engine it's built on.

659
00:46:32,076 --> 00:46:34,077
[SPEAKER_01]: It's built on the LA Rush engine, believe it or not.

660
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:36,799
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're talking about maybe...

661
00:46:37,588 --> 00:46:38,909
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

662
00:46:58,886 --> 00:47:01,067
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess not, but I don't think he'd mind me sharing.

663
00:47:01,107 --> 00:47:07,410
[SPEAKER_02]: He linked me to a story on GoNintendo.com which talks about the demo unit, which we talked about a little bit ago for the Wii.

664
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:13,792
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently, according to GoNintendo, the picture has turned out to be true due to numerous sources who have informed me.

665
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:18,154
[SPEAKER_02]: The same image shows up in a packet sent out to EB GameStop employees to get them ready for the unit.

666
00:47:18,614 --> 00:47:20,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad to hear that it turned out to be real.

667
00:47:20,315 --> 00:47:21,316
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like the look of it.

668
00:47:22,976 --> 00:47:23,597
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the whole...

669
00:47:24,923 --> 00:47:29,224
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, the guys said Street Cruise were the way they were going to demo it, not the units.

670
00:47:30,185 --> 00:47:31,785
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know.

671
00:47:32,525 --> 00:47:34,386
[SPEAKER_01]: Could that mean a reduction in the units?

672
00:47:34,606 --> 00:47:40,528
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was going to be harder to do maybe the retail units just because of the setup that's needed for them.

673
00:47:40,568 --> 00:47:43,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe he was talking about the promotional marketing stuff.

674
00:47:43,969 --> 00:47:45,250
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not doing demo units like that.

675
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:50,111
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that EBs and GameStop have the in-store units that they always have.

676
00:47:50,251 --> 00:47:51,372
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be honest, you guys,

677
00:47:53,274 --> 00:47:54,055
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

678
00:48:12,614 --> 00:48:12,994
[SPEAKER_01]: Psychonauts

679
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:36,347
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

680
00:48:48,118 --> 00:48:49,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, why don't you start us off tonight?

681
00:49:18,633 --> 00:49:47,056
[SPEAKER_01]: F you at these drinks taking like ass no offense I mean it's kind of like you know watermelon thing don't make it too strong um I don't know mainly my F you this week goes to people that do not pay attention on the road and who cannot park and I swear to god every time I see someone on a cell phone I know that they're gonna be driving like shit and you can always tell you know these people they're you know veering in and out of lanes going slow

682
00:49:47,469 --> 00:50:17,229
[SPEAKER_01]: you know can't seem to follow the road at all and then you drive past them you see they're yapping away on the cell phone well fuck them also these people that fucking do not take the time to park their cars correctly you know you get into a parking complex that doesn't have a lot of parking and then all of a sudden you see oh Jackass is over the line he's taken up two spaces because his fucking Yukon or whatever is too big for a compact space well fuck them for trying to park in these goddamn small spaces

683
00:50:19,625 --> 00:50:21,126
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, to you Rob.

684
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:26,548
[SPEAKER_02]: My FU of the week goes to busyness.

685
00:50:26,668 --> 00:50:31,410
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been like crazy busy with all this stuff going on and I've had like zero free time.

686
00:50:31,951 --> 00:50:34,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially when it comes to my work life is mostly what I'm talking about here.

687
00:50:35,272 --> 00:50:36,593
[SPEAKER_02]: My work life has just been nuts.

688
00:50:36,853 --> 00:50:42,435
[SPEAKER_02]: And FU to having this feeling because this is how I felt.

689
00:50:42,475 --> 00:50:43,536
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of a work story.

690
00:50:45,357 --> 00:50:45,997
[SPEAKER_02]: FU to...

691
00:50:46,815 --> 00:50:54,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Folks that like to leave carrots on the ground, and then you kind of hop up to that carrot to take a little bite, and then BAM!

692
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:55,638
[SPEAKER_02]: The net comes out and grabs you.

693
00:50:55,658 --> 00:50:57,699
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of work do you do?

694
00:50:58,839 --> 00:50:59,860
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hunting wabbits.

695
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you a furry?

696
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,341
[SPEAKER_02]: No, gross.

697
00:51:03,041 --> 00:51:03,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Miklatov, your turn.

698
00:51:04,241 --> 00:51:05,802
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have an FU of the week.

699
00:51:05,882 --> 00:51:07,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Well then F you to Miklatov.

700
00:51:07,263 --> 00:51:09,723
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to me for not having an FU of this week.

701
00:51:09,743 --> 00:51:13,765
[SPEAKER_02]: How about F you to Miklatov for fucking suckering me back into Final Fantasy XI and it's...

702
00:51:14,395 --> 00:51:19,479
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome, because the day that you started, you're like, you're not going to get me to play this.

703
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:20,620
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, we'll see.

704
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:32,728
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't even have to coerce you that much, and you're just like, you wanted to check out how the graphics were on the 360 update, and we couldn't get mine to log in, so you had to log in, you had to pay for it, and then you just started playing, and it was great.

705
00:51:33,289 --> 00:51:33,709
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate you.

706
00:51:34,629 --> 00:51:35,770
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm the best.

707
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:42,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks to Final Fantasy XI, here's a game I haven't been playing a lot of on Xbox Live this week, but I did get it patched.

708
00:51:42,708 --> 00:51:43,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

709
00:52:02,272 --> 00:52:05,574
[SPEAKER_02]: It discourages people from backing out at all if someone's going to get a loss.

710
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,535
[SPEAKER_02]: So no backing out of the game early.

711
00:52:07,955 --> 00:52:12,838
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they also address some of those timeout issues and connection things with this patch.

712
00:52:13,198 --> 00:52:15,359
[SPEAKER_01]: And reset the leaderboards.

713
00:52:15,739 --> 00:52:19,081
[SPEAKER_01]: Why can't they just have a counter for disconnects?

714
00:52:19,591 --> 00:52:20,952
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

715
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:52,884
[SPEAKER_01]: Will I get achievement points for playing it?

716
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:04,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well then I think I'd be okay with that.

717
00:53:33,425 --> 00:53:39,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, speculation abounds here on the internet about Windows Vista.

718
00:53:39,595 --> 00:53:47,026
[SPEAKER_02]: And usually we don't talk about a lot of non-gaming news, but this is kind of relevant because folks do their gamings on PC.

719
00:53:47,367 --> 00:53:48,529
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know we don't talk enough about...

720
00:53:49,209 --> 00:53:52,052
[SPEAKER_01]: And you also have DirectX 10, which is going to be fucking awesome for gaming.

721
00:53:52,112 --> 00:53:56,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, and I'm just saying, we don't talk a lot about PC games on this show, and I apologize for that.

722
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:57,717
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just we're so busy with consoles.

723
00:53:57,977 --> 00:54:05,604
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do try to talk about big things in the computer gaming world, and this would certainly be one of them, even if it is about an operating system, and it's about Windows Vista.

724
00:54:06,105 --> 00:54:11,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, apparently Microsoft Canada actually spilled the beans on their website about how much

725
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:12,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Vista Home Basic

726
00:54:35,309 --> 00:54:35,689
[SPEAKER_02]: and 26993.

727
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:44,395
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be noted that Microsoft Canada has since removed the listing and they said, quote, a number of pricing models are undergoing consideration internally.

728
00:54:44,716 --> 00:54:46,137
[SPEAKER_02]: However, nothing has been finalized.

729
00:54:46,197 --> 00:54:50,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft is currently finalizing its pricing model and will have more to share at a later date.

730
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:53,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I'm starting to get the impression that Microsoft Canada is kind of retarded.

731
00:54:55,263 --> 00:54:58,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because of the whole, you know, they did the bundle thing when they weren't supposed to and all that other stuff?

732
00:54:58,965 --> 00:54:59,266
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

733
00:54:59,446 --> 00:55:00,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know.

734
00:55:00,026 --> 00:55:02,228
[SPEAKER_02]: That kind of makes them cool that they're doing stuff when they're not supposed to.

735
00:55:02,548 --> 00:55:03,428
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that makes them retarded.

736
00:55:03,448 --> 00:55:04,189
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it makes them great.

737
00:55:05,439 --> 00:55:05,839
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

738
00:55:05,979 --> 00:55:06,379
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.

739
00:55:06,399 --> 00:55:08,060
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's kind of funny.

740
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:15,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe it's just because I'm still having those residual I'm going to move to Canada someday feelings because I just, I love Vancouver so much.

741
00:55:15,442 --> 00:55:15,942
[SPEAKER_02]: What can I say?

742
00:55:15,982 --> 00:55:16,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

743
00:55:16,702 --> 00:55:16,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

744
00:55:17,362 --> 00:55:30,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we love you guys who choose to email us every week so much and we like to read your emails and even though DarkSakura is not here this week, that's not going to prevent me from borrowing her gear and jumping into the mailbag at mailbag at orange launch radio dot com.

745
00:55:32,774 --> 00:55:37,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Email numero uno comes to us tonight from somebody from Vancouver, Canada.

746
00:55:37,399 --> 00:55:38,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Go figure.

747
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:39,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, Vancouver Island.

748
00:55:40,042 --> 00:55:40,722
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a difference.

749
00:55:41,183 --> 00:55:42,624
[SPEAKER_02]: You see the island is out.

750
00:55:42,784 --> 00:55:43,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, forget it.

751
00:55:44,426 --> 00:55:45,968
[SPEAKER_02]: This comes to us from Wyatt.

752
00:55:47,353 --> 00:55:49,916
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

753
00:56:05,074 --> 00:56:06,155
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura's butt-kicking-ness

754
00:56:21,087 --> 00:56:26,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks a lot for what you do for us loyal listeners, and here's for years more of the same.

755
00:56:41,667 --> 00:56:42,027
[SPEAKER_02]: P.S.

756
00:56:42,588 --> 00:56:44,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Sky, you should come to Canada more often.

757
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:54,956
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think that the maple syrup cookies sold on Granville Island are good, you should try the... I don't know what they're called, but basically they are maple syrup thrown into snow and then eaten like a piece of maple syrup thrown in the snow.

758
00:56:55,277 --> 00:56:56,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks a lot, you guys.

759
00:56:56,998 --> 00:56:58,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe if I come in the winter, I'll have to try that.

760
00:56:58,639 --> 00:56:59,660
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like a winter treat.

761
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:01,781
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if I try to eat that in the summer, that might be kind of weird.

762
00:57:02,222 --> 00:57:03,322
[SPEAKER_02]: But thank you very much for the email.

763
00:57:04,603 --> 00:57:09,047
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I might know which podcast you're talking about, because I keep tabs on a few that are going on, and you know...

764
00:57:09,989 --> 00:57:10,750
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tough.

765
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:11,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Things change.

766
00:57:11,951 --> 00:57:13,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Our personal lives change.

767
00:57:13,532 --> 00:57:16,174
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes, you know, it just affects what's going on.

768
00:57:16,535 --> 00:57:23,280
[SPEAKER_02]: And as much as I would love to do Orange Lounge Radio forever, you know, there might come a time where I have to move for work.

769
00:57:23,401 --> 00:57:24,722
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura has to move.

770
00:57:24,882 --> 00:57:26,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki's got to go somewhere.

771
00:57:26,423 --> 00:57:29,326
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and we would like to think that we would keep the show going.

772
00:57:29,406 --> 00:57:34,830
[SPEAKER_02]: So I applaud the other shows that try to keep on going despite the other little setbacks that go on.

773
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:36,812
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to continue to support independent radio forever.

774
00:57:37,152 --> 00:57:42,037
[SPEAKER_02]: My advice, if it's new people that have been thrown into it, give them a couple weeks to warm up.

775
00:57:42,057 --> 00:57:43,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'll tell you what, this shit ain't easy.

776
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:48,983
[SPEAKER_02]: I realize it seems like it's easy because you hear all these shows and you form opinions on them.

777
00:57:49,303 --> 00:57:53,687
[SPEAKER_02]: But the difference between doing and listening is really, really, really different.

778
00:57:54,107 --> 00:57:55,228
[SPEAKER_02]: And trust me, it raises my...

779
00:57:58,055 --> 00:58:01,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Perception of Independent Podcasts just so much more by doing one of my own.

780
00:58:01,276 --> 00:58:03,417
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, give them a chance.

781
00:58:03,497 --> 00:58:06,619
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet you that same thing that you liked before will come back.

782
00:58:06,659 --> 00:58:09,880
[SPEAKER_02]: But if, you know, not, we appreciate the fact that you check us out and support us.

783
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:12,601
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fact that you're supporting independent radio at all is awesome.

784
00:58:12,681 --> 00:58:16,883
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope things go good for you and the shows that you're listening to.

785
00:58:17,103 --> 00:58:18,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to a new email.

786
00:58:18,484 --> 00:58:20,365
[SPEAKER_02]: This person did not sign their email.

787
00:58:20,425 --> 00:58:24,767
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will, let's see, I'll just call them Tolu because I think that's what...

788
00:58:25,899 --> 00:58:28,302
[SPEAKER_02]: The subject in support of the PSP because of the uninformed bashing and ninty fanboys

789
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:38,944
[SPEAKER_02]: We asked for emails like this, so here you go.

790
00:58:39,764 --> 00:58:43,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Over the last couple months, the Sony bashing in the news has become almost unbearable.

791
00:58:44,065 --> 00:58:49,726
[SPEAKER_02]: They bash the PSP saying that it has no good games or just ports, while the DS has just as many.

792
00:58:49,846 --> 00:58:58,248
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, Animal Crossing, New Super Mario Bros., Castlevania, wait, you can go outside the castle, Innovative, Metroid, etc.

793
00:58:58,508 --> 00:58:58,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

794
00:58:59,268 --> 00:59:02,671
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a deeper experience instead of minigames or games from 15 years ago.

795
00:59:03,072 --> 00:59:09,017
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Syphon Filter, Daxter, Tekken, Metal Gear Solid, LocoRoco, Wipeout, and GTA.

796
00:59:09,137 --> 00:59:10,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Not Mario again.

797
00:59:10,819 --> 00:59:12,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Ninty fans don't care, though.

798
00:59:13,221 --> 00:59:13,861
[SPEAKER_02]: There's that email.

799
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:24,345
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate your perspective, because I think this guy does bring up a point, is that a lot of people say the PSP is the same shit over again, and then run off to play the newest Mario game.

800
00:59:24,365 --> 00:59:25,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, he brought up another point, though, too.

801
00:59:25,986 --> 00:59:26,186
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

802
00:59:26,326 --> 00:59:27,147
[SPEAKER_03]: He's wrong.

803
00:59:27,807 --> 00:59:28,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, hold on.

804
00:59:28,868 --> 00:59:41,855
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do have to say, okay, wait a minute, though, because the games that you mentioned at the end there, Tekken, Metal Gear Solid, Wipeout, Grand Theft, those are all franchises, too, that get a new game every year, so I don't know if that's the best perspective.

805
00:59:41,895 --> 00:59:43,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, hold on.

806
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:46,083
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree, there's not a lot on the PSP.

807
00:59:46,403 --> 00:59:50,869
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, I do own a PSP, and to be honest, I play more on my PSP than I do on my DS.

808
00:59:52,351 --> 00:59:56,055
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's right in most aspects, but he's also wrong in some stuff too.

809
00:59:56,316 --> 00:59:59,019
[SPEAKER_01]: He's right in the fact that there are a lot of games that are just ports.

810
00:59:59,059 --> 01:00:02,764
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Super Mario 64 for the DS, Animal Crossing...

811
01:00:03,775 --> 01:00:10,817
[SPEAKER_01]: Not quite a port, more of like kind of an upgrade to the current game, but still not very different to where it's like a different game.

812
01:00:10,837 --> 01:00:11,377
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

813
01:00:12,517 --> 01:00:13,157
[SPEAKER_01]: That's different.

814
01:00:13,477 --> 01:00:19,559
[SPEAKER_01]: You are getting some exclusive games like, you know, you've got the Tony Hawk American Skate Land and the new Downhill Jam is going to be coming out.

815
01:00:20,439 --> 01:00:23,559
[SPEAKER_01]: They are getting like some exclusive new games and stuff.

816
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:26,400
[SPEAKER_01]: Castlevania, yeah, Castlevania is pretty much Castlevania.

817
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:27,340
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a new game.

818
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:30,081
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a port of like, say, Castlevania 2 or something like that.

819
01:00:30,961 --> 01:00:31,622
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's new.

820
01:00:31,942 --> 01:00:36,586
[SPEAKER_02]: And for longtime fans of the series, getting to go outside the castle is something new, but I get your point.

821
01:00:37,086 --> 01:00:39,368
[SPEAKER_01]: Now for the PSP though, you have the same thing.

822
01:00:39,468 --> 01:00:47,934
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, PSP Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection, it's a port of the arcade game, it's also a port of Tekken 5, but still it's good to have a fighting game on, you know.

823
01:00:48,414 --> 01:00:48,954
[SPEAKER_01]: The PSP.

824
01:00:49,214 --> 01:00:51,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you've got all these collections that are coming out.

825
01:00:51,615 --> 01:00:56,276
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the Capcom Puzzle Collection, which is ports of old games.

826
01:00:57,556 --> 01:01:01,857
[SPEAKER_01]: My biggest gripe with Sony, we'll get Twisted Metal head-on.

827
01:01:02,057 --> 01:01:03,178
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a port of Twisted Metal 2.

828
01:01:03,818 --> 01:01:05,358
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a blatant port of the game.

829
01:01:05,398 --> 01:01:09,139
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't change really anything other than adding online multiplayer.

830
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:12,260
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the same aspect, I think both...

831
01:01:13,083 --> 01:01:15,265
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

832
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:35,891
[SPEAKER_01]: I was hoping for a little bit better of a game.

833
01:01:36,011 --> 01:01:41,794
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Twisted Metal head on, you know, I wanted it to be a new game, and it was just the old game all over again.

834
01:01:41,854 --> 01:01:44,916
[SPEAKER_02]: GS68 brings up an interesting counterpoint in our chatroom right there.

835
01:01:44,976 --> 01:01:47,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the Oil Army ports render the original obsolete.

836
01:01:48,017 --> 01:01:51,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Not on portables, because that way I can play my favorite games on the go.

837
01:01:51,959 --> 01:01:53,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need a TV or a system.

838
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:55,681
[SPEAKER_03]: in the car or on the train.

839
01:01:55,701 --> 01:01:57,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, but it renders the original obsolete.

840
01:01:57,941 --> 01:01:59,222
[SPEAKER_02]: So what about the game on the TV?

841
01:01:59,802 --> 01:02:03,943
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a completely different experience playing the same game on a TV and on the portable.

842
01:02:04,063 --> 01:02:04,983
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to point this out too.

843
01:02:05,023 --> 01:02:11,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Yuri Lover says, Objection, because there are other games that are original on the Nintendo DS and cites the following.

844
01:02:11,585 --> 01:02:14,606
[SPEAKER_02]: WarioWare, Phoenix Wright, Trauma Center, Nintendogs.

845
01:02:15,046 --> 01:02:18,671
[SPEAKER_02]: WarioWare is not really, because I came out on Game Boy Advance.

846
01:02:18,691 --> 01:02:20,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, but you get the point, though.

847
01:02:21,054 --> 01:02:24,479
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a really original game.

848
01:02:24,499 --> 01:02:27,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Japanese, but okay, whatever, whatever.

849
01:02:27,263 --> 01:02:28,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'll help them out then.

850
01:02:28,505 --> 01:02:31,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Electroplankton, Elite Beat Agents, there you go.

851
01:02:32,332 --> 01:02:35,233
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well, if you want PSP games, let me try to think here.

852
01:02:35,913 --> 01:02:37,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Luminous, I understand.

853
01:02:37,313 --> 01:02:39,353
[SPEAKER_02]: But look, here's the thing.

854
01:02:39,373 --> 01:02:39,813
[SPEAKER_02]: That's enough.

855
01:02:41,034 --> 01:02:41,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing.

856
01:02:41,754 --> 01:02:42,514
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always said this.

857
01:02:42,874 --> 01:02:48,035
[SPEAKER_02]: The PSP is a great system if you want to do more with a handheld than just game.

858
01:02:48,435 --> 01:02:54,516
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to do the web, music, movies, all that crap is great on the PSP.

859
01:02:54,616 --> 01:02:59,117
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really the reason to own a PSP, because you want something that's a multimedia thing on the go.

860
01:02:59,697 --> 01:03:01,739
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's kind of where Sony's going.

861
01:03:01,759 --> 01:03:03,861
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 3, I think it's going to be a lot of that as well.

862
01:03:04,241 --> 01:03:09,106
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're going to see in the long run from PlayStation 3, it doesn't want to be just a game system.

863
01:03:09,526 --> 01:03:12,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony's biggest problem is that Xbox 360 doesn't want to be just a game system either.

864
01:03:12,489 --> 01:03:13,570
[SPEAKER_02]: But never mind, that's another day.

865
01:03:14,351 --> 01:03:16,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo, on the other hand, is...

866
01:03:17,153 --> 01:03:20,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting to catch up with some of that with the Opera browser coming out and everything.

867
01:03:20,896 --> 01:03:23,838
[SPEAKER_02]: But for now, it's really just about the games.

868
01:03:23,878 --> 01:03:24,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Games, games, games.

869
01:03:24,919 --> 01:03:32,885
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want some fun, short attention span, most of the time, types of games, you know, for the casual gamer, Nintendo DS is where it's at.

870
01:03:33,406 --> 01:03:37,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, if you're a real hardcore gamer, you ought to own both.

871
01:03:37,529 --> 01:03:38,109
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can afford it.

872
01:03:38,590 --> 01:03:39,530
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can't afford it, get a job.

873
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:42,853
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be honest, I mean, what are people complaining about ports anyways?

874
01:03:42,953 --> 01:03:45,275
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you don't like them, don't buy them.

875
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:46,711
[SPEAKER_01]: or Don'tPlayThem.

876
01:03:47,231 --> 01:03:49,453
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot coming out for both systems.

877
01:03:49,813 --> 01:03:52,795
[SPEAKER_01]: Granted, when I look at it, I think most of it's crap.

878
01:03:52,915 --> 01:03:55,097
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, I only play one game on my PSP.

879
01:03:55,537 --> 01:03:59,960
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't really have a valid opinion on most of this stuff.

880
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:03,423
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is a lot of games that come out that I'm just not impressed with.

881
01:04:03,703 --> 01:04:04,944
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like, whatever.

882
01:04:05,224 --> 01:04:05,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Ouch.

883
01:04:05,804 --> 01:04:10,688
[SPEAKER_02]: The chat room is bringing up from various folks there that the DS has had their share of misfires.

884
01:04:11,108 --> 01:04:12,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Such as Ping Pals.

885
01:04:12,669 --> 01:04:13,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God.

886
01:04:13,169 --> 01:04:14,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Sprung, anyone?

887
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:15,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Sprung was funny.

888
01:04:15,631 --> 01:04:18,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Sprung was the worst video game I've ever played in my life.

889
01:04:19,353 --> 01:04:22,695
[SPEAKER_03]: If you play as the guy, the game is hilarious.

890
01:04:23,516 --> 01:04:24,096
[SPEAKER_02]: One more email.

891
01:04:24,116 --> 01:04:25,077
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to do one more email.

892
01:04:25,097 --> 01:04:25,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

893
01:04:25,457 --> 01:04:26,998
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is from DJ Tyrant.

894
01:04:27,952 --> 01:04:29,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, Jamie, Rob, and Matt.

895
01:04:29,233 --> 01:04:30,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope all is well with you.

896
01:04:30,414 --> 01:04:35,179
[SPEAKER_02]: I finally have caught back up with the show now that I have moved and have cable internet at the place I'm currently living.

897
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:39,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like the show is doing great, like always, and is very informative and actually helps me out at my work.

898
01:04:39,623 --> 01:04:40,904
[SPEAKER_02]: I work at EB Games, FYI.

899
01:04:41,324 --> 01:04:42,345
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually quite a compliment.

900
01:04:42,365 --> 01:04:42,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

901
01:04:42,826 --> 01:04:46,289
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually heard of stores that have been playing our show over the system.

902
01:04:46,369 --> 01:04:48,411
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that is crazy, but awesome.

903
01:04:48,491 --> 01:04:48,831
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

904
01:04:48,951 --> 01:04:49,312
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

905
01:04:49,332 --> 01:04:49,832
[SPEAKER_02]: That's weird.

906
01:04:50,092 --> 01:04:51,714
[SPEAKER_03]: It's better than Ian Kessler.

907
01:04:51,914 --> 01:04:55,097
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gotta be better than the EB Games Television or whatever that crap is.

908
01:04:55,117 --> 01:04:58,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Ian Kessler and Courtney Friel, they both suck and I want to beat them up.

909
01:04:58,601 --> 01:05:01,124
[SPEAKER_02]: If you work at EB Games, get our show played in there.

910
01:05:01,184 --> 01:05:06,629
[SPEAKER_02]: We will send you versions that have the S words and F words bleeped out if we will get played in store.

911
01:05:06,669 --> 01:05:07,290
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty hot.

912
01:05:08,792 --> 01:05:14,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, the point of this email was to encourage the OL Army to get involved in the Beatmania US Internet Ranking.

913
01:05:15,058 --> 01:05:19,500
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would be a great way to show Konami interest in the game and that people did actually buy the game.

914
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:23,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently, I've only seen Drew Nami and myself in the internet ranking so far.

915
01:05:23,762 --> 01:05:24,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry if I missed anyone.

916
01:05:24,963 --> 01:05:26,883
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could mention this on the show, that would be great.

917
01:05:27,204 --> 01:05:31,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so if you're a music game fan, go show your love in the Beatmania internet ranking.

918
01:05:31,746 --> 01:05:32,206
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.

919
01:05:32,266 --> 01:05:38,629
[SPEAKER_01]: For the record, they did see that game as a success, and it sold as many units, or it outsold as many units as they thought it would, so...

920
01:05:39,409 --> 01:05:40,810
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds like a good sign.

921
01:05:40,930 --> 01:05:42,330
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

922
01:05:42,530 --> 01:05:47,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I am really looking forward to the music previews for DDR Ultramix 4 and DDR Universe.

923
01:05:47,712 --> 01:05:49,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about the delay there.

924
01:05:50,113 --> 01:05:53,815
[SPEAKER_02]: When are you going to get some music previews for In the Groove 3?

925
01:05:54,835 --> 01:05:56,356
[SPEAKER_02]: With a little face on it.

926
01:05:56,816 --> 01:05:57,276
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

927
01:05:57,776 --> 01:05:58,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Have Rockstar give us a call.

928
01:05:59,037 --> 01:05:59,517
[SPEAKER_02]: We're open.

929
01:06:00,658 --> 01:06:03,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep up the great work and I can't wait to hear your next show.

930
01:06:03,299 --> 01:06:06,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe sometime in the future I will see you guys again at a con or something like that.

931
01:06:07,150 --> 01:06:12,397
[SPEAKER_02]: as it was a disappointment to see you, OnlyRob, I believe, for an extremely short time by the Konami booth at E3 this year.

932
01:06:12,833 --> 01:06:14,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, stay healthy and well, guys.

933
01:06:14,214 --> 01:06:15,394
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad your show is doing so great.

934
01:06:15,615 --> 01:06:16,275
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Tyrant.

935
01:06:16,315 --> 01:06:17,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much for the email.

936
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:17,816
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very sweet.

937
01:06:18,796 --> 01:06:23,139
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as other previews for other games go, we're not exclusive.

938
01:06:23,419 --> 01:06:25,620
[SPEAKER_02]: We branched out of the music game thing a long time ago.

939
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:26,640
[SPEAKER_02]: We love music games.

940
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:29,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get us wrong, but we love all video games as well.

941
01:06:29,142 --> 01:06:33,604
[SPEAKER_02]: So if any company wants to do some type of premiere thing, we're down.

942
01:06:33,664 --> 01:06:34,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Just have them give us a call.

943
01:06:34,825 --> 01:06:36,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

944
01:06:37,026 --> 01:06:39,347
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use that for your comments as well.

945
01:06:39,387 --> 01:06:40,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk about your game.

946
01:06:40,348 --> 01:06:40,768
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

947
01:06:41,885 --> 01:06:43,025
[SPEAKER_02]: We would love to get you on the show.

948
01:06:43,846 --> 01:06:48,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, yes, we've given In the Groove somewhat of a hard time on the show in the past, but you know what?

949
01:06:48,567 --> 01:06:49,648
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm willing to give it a try.

950
01:06:50,728 --> 01:06:52,668
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually don't hate In the Groove.

951
01:06:52,709 --> 01:06:53,349
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's fine.

952
01:06:53,389 --> 01:06:54,409
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an alternative.

953
01:06:54,929 --> 01:06:55,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people like Coke.

954
01:06:55,950 --> 01:06:56,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people like Pepsi.

955
01:06:57,190 --> 01:06:58,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people like Coke.

956
01:06:58,490 --> 01:06:59,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people like pee.

957
01:06:59,851 --> 01:07:02,492
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people like RC Cola for some god-awful reason.

958
01:07:02,512 --> 01:07:03,312
[SPEAKER_02]: RC Cola is okay.

959
01:07:03,392 --> 01:07:03,732
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

960
01:07:04,232 --> 01:07:05,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on, please.

961
01:07:05,693 --> 01:07:06,133
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways.

962
01:07:07,441 --> 01:07:16,724
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, scratch one other loss for Sony, unfortunately, in their battle against Homebrew.

963
01:07:17,024 --> 01:07:17,504
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yes.

964
01:07:18,444 --> 01:07:35,429
[SPEAKER_01]: Firmware 2.8 has been hacked, and now Homebrew is able... So far, they have found an exploit in 2.8, and they have Homebrew running now in every single firmware that's available from 2.0 and up, and of course, 1.5 and whatnot.

965
01:07:37,330 --> 01:07:47,738
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that's kind of interesting, and the best part about it, you don't need Grand Theft Auto for it to work, because unfortunately with some of the other ones, that's how you had to do it, is with Grand Theft Auto.

966
01:07:48,238 --> 01:08:03,250
[SPEAKER_01]: But now, they do have a Hello World proof of concept homebrew program that is available out there, and, um, yeah, it's quite interesting actually, because, um, there's also, was a story that I read, um, this week, that they're

967
01:08:04,158 --> 01:08:04,398
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.

968
01:08:24,486 --> 01:08:25,287
[SPEAKER_01]: GPS comes out.

969
01:08:27,029 --> 01:08:28,851
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing with the liquor?

970
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:31,614
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I hear you starting to slur a little bit and I'm doing the same thing.

971
01:08:31,634 --> 01:08:32,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm fine.

972
01:08:32,334 --> 01:08:34,737
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like halfway through that.

973
01:08:34,997 --> 01:08:37,420
[SPEAKER_02]: The chat room pointed out to me that you can call our mailbag.

974
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:38,961
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something I said earlier, I guess.

975
01:08:39,021 --> 01:08:39,322
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

976
01:08:40,518 --> 01:08:41,498
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever, I'm not paying attention.

977
01:08:41,538 --> 01:08:41,958
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut up!

978
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:43,359
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but here's the thing.

979
01:08:43,379 --> 01:08:44,519
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know me!

980
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:46,020
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know my life.

981
01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:49,321
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like, I'm starting to get sick of the watermelon thing.

982
01:08:49,381 --> 01:08:49,981
[SPEAKER_01]: You want something new?

983
01:08:50,361 --> 01:08:50,741
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

984
01:08:50,841 --> 01:08:52,221
[SPEAKER_01]: You want some pineapple?

985
01:08:52,241 --> 01:08:52,621
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want... No, no.

986
01:08:52,641 --> 01:08:53,782
[SPEAKER_01]: You want some of the... You want to try this again?

987
01:08:53,922 --> 01:08:55,402
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, I don't want that stuff.

988
01:08:55,582 --> 01:08:57,143
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially if you don't want the orange juice.

989
01:08:57,383 --> 01:08:57,603
[SPEAKER_01]: Pussy.

990
01:08:58,877 --> 01:08:59,958
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't like orange juice.

991
01:09:00,218 --> 01:09:07,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I've got this thing stuck in my head now where orange juice equals vomiting, and so it's not good drinking.

992
01:09:07,443 --> 01:09:07,823
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

993
01:09:07,883 --> 01:09:15,808
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the first times I ever threw up, I threw up SpaghettiOs, and for some reason, I've never been able to really eat SpaghettiOs the same way ever since then.

994
01:09:16,489 --> 01:09:17,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what's interesting, though?

995
01:09:17,809 --> 01:09:21,071
[SPEAKER_01]: The first time I threw up here from over-drinking was...

996
01:09:22,537 --> 01:09:24,038
[SPEAKER_01]: Minestrone Blue Raspberry Jell-O

997
01:09:42,577 --> 01:09:44,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Which was actually not that bad.

998
01:09:44,218 --> 01:09:47,860
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good going down and coming up.

999
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:50,321
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of like, wow, kind of sweet.

1000
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:52,142
[SPEAKER_01]: They should put that on the box.

1001
01:09:52,782 --> 01:09:53,782
[SPEAKER_01]: Raspberry Jell-O.

1002
01:09:54,123 --> 01:09:56,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Great going down, pretty good coming up.

1003
01:10:00,065 --> 01:10:00,986
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see it now.

1004
01:10:03,052 --> 01:10:04,234
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck those Pudding Pops.

1005
01:10:04,395 --> 01:10:07,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Shane, you might have to do the rest of the stories tonight.

1006
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:07,801
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that sound?

1007
01:10:08,362 --> 01:10:10,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm just going to complain.

1008
01:10:10,145 --> 01:10:12,870
[SPEAKER_03]: So how's that Suikoden doing?

1009
01:10:13,732 --> 01:10:14,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck Suikoden.

1010
01:10:18,163 --> 01:10:19,024
[SPEAKER_02]: I will kill you.

1011
01:10:19,044 --> 01:10:19,624
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.

1012
01:10:19,644 --> 01:10:20,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Suikoden's not that bad.

1013
01:10:20,826 --> 01:10:21,546
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.

1014
01:10:21,566 --> 01:10:22,627
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not that great either.

1015
01:10:23,488 --> 01:10:27,152
[SPEAKER_02]: When are they putting out Suikoden on PSP?

1016
01:10:30,154 --> 01:10:35,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's this movement on an official Konami site.

1017
01:10:35,359 --> 01:10:38,102
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like konamigamestars.com.

1018
01:10:38,142 --> 01:10:43,407
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an RPG site that Konami opened for the US fans of the Konami RPGs.

1019
01:10:44,116 --> 01:10:51,642
[SPEAKER_03]: And they want the fans to show how much they want this port of 1 and 2 that came out for PSP in Japan to come out over here.

1020
01:10:52,183 --> 01:11:05,954
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm sure I just made up the website URL I just sent with the KonamiGameStars.com, but if you go there and show your support, I mean, we're really trying to get it to come out here, so...

1021
01:11:06,943 --> 01:11:08,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Show that it will sell.

1022
01:11:08,144 --> 01:11:11,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't you talk to someone at work and make it happen?

1023
01:11:11,167 --> 01:11:14,570
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been talking for a long time about this game coming out over here.

1024
01:11:14,630 --> 01:11:16,832
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, come on, put it out on the PSP.

1025
01:11:16,872 --> 01:11:19,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I come to your work and berate people?

1026
01:11:19,975 --> 01:11:22,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Because obviously Kami doesn't mind if people drink.

1027
01:11:22,918 --> 01:11:24,418
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even have a freaking office at my job.

1028
01:11:24,458 --> 01:11:26,659
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I have to share my office with two other people.

1029
01:11:45,373 --> 01:11:50,036
[SPEAKER_03]: I do too, but just one other person and he's leaving soon, so I'm going to get the office office myself again.

1030
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:51,317
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a funny thing, Rob.

1031
01:11:52,818 --> 01:12:00,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Since our sales staff is down to two people now for the games, at least they're in our building, my co-worker is like, yeah, at the end of September I'm thinking about leaving.

1032
01:12:00,804 --> 01:12:01,364
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, sweet!

1033
01:12:01,624 --> 01:12:02,525
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be just me!

1034
01:12:03,866 --> 01:12:04,566
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be awesome.

1035
01:12:05,547 --> 01:12:06,568
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd fucking own everybody.

1036
01:12:07,668 --> 01:12:08,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, um...

1037
01:12:09,952 --> 01:12:13,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, uh, Eddie would like to point out his Konami RPG stars, by the way.

1038
01:12:13,597 --> 01:12:14,278
[SPEAKER_03]: What did I say?

1039
01:12:14,298 --> 01:12:14,578
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1040
01:12:14,599 --> 01:12:16,361
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I said something... You're not even drunk!

1041
01:12:16,381 --> 01:12:17,042
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your excuse?

1042
01:12:17,262 --> 01:12:18,043
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm stupid!

1043
01:12:18,143 --> 01:12:20,226
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much my excuse.

1044
01:12:20,306 --> 01:12:21,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, you are.

1045
01:12:22,189 --> 01:12:22,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, look.

1046
01:12:23,801 --> 01:12:26,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to get through this segment in under two hours, please.

1047
01:12:26,963 --> 01:12:29,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on, you know, because we don't want to get any more.

1048
01:12:29,445 --> 01:12:31,746
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need any angry iTunes reviews this week.

1049
01:12:32,106 --> 01:12:34,207
[SPEAKER_02]: This show is too fucking long.

1050
01:12:34,348 --> 01:12:37,069
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to download this show because it's too long.

1051
01:12:37,549 --> 01:12:39,971
[SPEAKER_02]: I like my news short.

1052
01:12:39,991 --> 01:12:40,411
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1053
01:12:40,451 --> 01:12:41,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Turn on G4.

1054
01:12:41,252 --> 01:12:44,133
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll get about two minutes of game news in an entire 24-hour period.

1055
01:12:44,214 --> 01:12:45,094
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Star Trek.

1056
01:12:49,397 --> 01:12:49,697
[SPEAKER_02]: You know...

1057
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:55,062
[SPEAKER_02]: This month's PlayStation Magazine has a scoop on the new PSP model.

1058
01:12:55,142 --> 01:12:58,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, the unit features 8GB of flash memory built in.

1059
01:12:58,864 --> 01:12:59,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow!

1060
01:12:59,845 --> 01:13:03,007
[SPEAKER_02]: On top of that, there's a video camera still being planned, but no hard drive.

1061
01:13:04,147 --> 01:13:08,189
[SPEAKER_02]: I seem to recall there was something I read later in the week where Sony said, Nope.

1062
01:13:08,230 --> 01:13:08,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Lies.

1063
01:13:08,950 --> 01:13:09,690
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all lies.

1064
01:13:09,810 --> 01:13:10,571
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not happening.

1065
01:13:10,851 --> 01:13:13,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that the official PlayStation Magazine or PSM?

1066
01:13:13,452 --> 01:13:15,093
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was the official PlayStation Magazine.

1067
01:13:15,113 --> 01:13:19,255
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell's wrong with these official... Let's just make up news.

1068
01:13:19,355 --> 01:13:19,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Who cares?

1069
01:13:20,444 --> 01:13:24,267
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll give the PSP more attention.

1070
01:13:24,427 --> 01:13:27,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck, chatroom pointed out I said something that was banned last week.

1071
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:28,591
[SPEAKER_02]: G4.

1072
01:13:29,812 --> 01:13:31,213
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not banned, I say whatever I want.

1073
01:13:31,233 --> 01:13:33,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, but you're not drunk, I can use that as an excuse.

1074
01:13:33,715 --> 01:13:33,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1075
01:13:34,015 --> 01:13:34,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad run.

1076
01:13:34,696 --> 01:13:36,297
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but I made fun of him, so it's okay.

1077
01:13:37,678 --> 01:13:40,921
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I still think, it's Borderlands, let it happen again.

1078
01:13:41,701 --> 01:13:43,383
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way though, I'm sorry.

1079
01:13:44,404 --> 01:13:44,944
[SPEAKER_01]: Very sorry.

1080
01:13:45,004 --> 01:13:48,327
[SPEAKER_01]: I do gotta mention, they are remaking the original Star Trek series.

1081
01:13:48,735 --> 01:13:52,738
[SPEAKER_01]: They're redoing all the CG effects in it, so you know that'll be playing on a certain channel soon.

1082
01:13:53,339 --> 01:13:55,200
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways... Yay!

1083
01:13:56,561 --> 01:13:57,882
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways... A little quieter.

1084
01:13:59,103 --> 01:13:59,864
[SPEAKER_01]: The PlayStation 3.

1085
01:13:59,924 --> 01:14:13,235
[SPEAKER_01]: There's news, actually from the Enquirer, which I'm sure is a great source of game news, that the RSX chip in the PlayStation 3, which it originally was set to run at 550, 700 core memory,

1086
01:14:16,733 --> 01:14:21,719
[SPEAKER_01]: has been realigned with the expectations that the value will be dropped to $506.50.

1087
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:26,365
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, being throttled down.

1088
01:14:27,667 --> 01:14:29,950
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's that supposed to mean to you?

1089
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:31,431
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably nothing because...

1090
01:14:32,132 --> 01:14:32,973
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1091
01:14:57,714 --> 01:15:03,597
[SPEAKER_02]: The slogan for the PlayStation 3 ad campaign has been revealed and it's called This Is Living.

1092
01:15:04,039 --> 01:15:08,482
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the new catchphrase you're going to hear, at least in Europe, I believe, but I think they're going to use that in the rest of the world.

1093
01:15:08,822 --> 01:15:09,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hope not.

1094
01:15:09,302 --> 01:15:13,165
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you take that last story into account, I think the tagline should have been, this is burning.

1095
01:15:13,185 --> 01:15:16,207
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think, I think they already have a catchphrase here in the U.S.

1096
01:15:16,587 --> 01:15:18,708
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called, we used the Spider-Man logo.

1097
01:15:18,748 --> 01:15:19,569
[SPEAKER_01]: Play Beyond?

1098
01:15:19,729 --> 01:15:21,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Play Beyond, I think.

1099
01:15:21,570 --> 01:15:23,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't know, somewhere else they're calling it.

1100
01:15:23,271 --> 01:15:25,312
[SPEAKER_01]: This is living.

1101
01:15:25,493 --> 01:15:30,396
[SPEAKER_01]: This is living in poverty because they spent all my money on a PlayStation 3.

1102
01:15:30,456 --> 01:15:30,856
[SPEAKER_01]: Hurrah.

1103
01:15:36,552 --> 01:15:37,813
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Welfare!

1104
01:16:01,874 --> 01:16:02,855
[SPEAKER_01]: This is crappy.

1105
01:16:02,875 --> 01:16:03,236
[SPEAKER_01]: This is awful.

1106
01:16:03,256 --> 01:16:03,776
[SPEAKER_01]: This joke needs to die.

1107
01:16:20,245 --> 01:16:24,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Rayman, of course, is coming to the Wii in the form of Rayman Raving Rabbids.

1108
01:16:25,987 --> 01:16:32,109
[SPEAKER_02]: And somehow the rumor got started that this game was going to be Wii exclusive, although I never heard that in my life.

1109
01:16:32,509 --> 01:16:37,750
[SPEAKER_02]: But needless to say, it was picked up earlier this week that Rayman is not going to be Wii exclusive.

1110
01:16:39,391 --> 01:16:45,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I don't know, there's all this confusion going on at Ubisoft because, you know, is Assassin's Creed exclusive and blah, blah, blah.

1111
01:16:45,673 --> 01:16:49,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Supposedly, it's supposed to hit more next-gen systems next year.

1112
01:16:50,061 --> 01:16:52,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Assassin's Creed, though, is definitely multi-platform.

1113
01:16:52,504 --> 01:16:54,627
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.

1114
01:16:55,027 --> 01:16:57,690
[SPEAKER_02]: So why the hell shouldn't Rayman be multi-platform?

1115
01:16:57,710 --> 01:16:59,392
[SPEAKER_01]: Corey, Ubisoft, I even asked them this.

1116
01:16:59,713 --> 01:17:02,796
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not exclusive, and it will be coming out.

1117
01:17:02,856 --> 01:17:08,483
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the Wii version is going to be exclusive to the Wii, obviously, because it has a different control system.

1118
01:17:09,525 --> 01:17:10,786
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1119
01:17:31,909 --> 01:17:32,950
[SPEAKER_01]: GameLock, Unconstitutional, Mike Hatch

1120
01:17:54,383 --> 01:18:03,839
[SPEAKER_01]: His reason for appealing it says, What the act really does is make sure the parents are involved in the decisions of whether their children should play violent or sexually explicit video games.

1121
01:18:04,677 --> 01:18:09,340
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with him in that statement because, yeah, parents should be involved with what their kids play.

1122
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:15,504
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I don't think the law should really do much as restricting people because I think it should really be up to the parents.

1123
01:18:16,044 --> 01:18:21,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, the law simply prohibits children 16 years old and younger from buying those types of games.

1124
01:18:21,788 --> 01:18:27,071
[SPEAKER_01]: If the parents aren't troubled by their kids playing these games, they can buy them for their children.

1125
01:18:27,291 --> 01:18:33,835
[SPEAKER_01]: But that still doesn't make any sense because what if these, say for example, little billies at a, you know,

1126
01:18:34,562 --> 01:18:35,462
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1127
01:18:54,542 --> 01:18:59,663
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's illegal to sell alcohol to a minor, but if your mom buys it for you, it's okay if you drink it.

1128
01:18:59,903 --> 01:19:02,044
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of the way that they're phrasing this.

1129
01:19:02,464 --> 01:19:06,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Which makes this law even more retarded, which there's no reason for the law anyways.

1130
01:19:07,405 --> 01:19:09,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Drunami in our chatroom says, enough is enough.

1131
01:19:09,785 --> 01:19:16,527
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if he's talking about what you're saying or all the incessant snakes on a plane jokes that are still going on in chatroom.

1132
01:19:16,567 --> 01:19:17,287
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so annoying.

1133
01:19:17,307 --> 01:19:19,527
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how I watched that movie this week?

1134
01:19:20,128 --> 01:19:20,668
[SPEAKER_01]: Lame!

1135
01:19:24,676 --> 01:19:27,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Macman says, here's the pop culture reference of the year.

1136
01:19:27,539 --> 01:19:30,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Insert animal here on a insert form of transportation.

1137
01:19:30,562 --> 01:19:31,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Mad Libs.

1138
01:19:34,085 --> 01:19:35,647
[SPEAKER_01]: Chainsaw on a dog.

1139
01:19:36,388 --> 01:19:43,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, if you want to join in the craziness that is our chat room, just head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on chat.

1140
01:19:44,841 --> 01:19:48,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I guess that's going to do it for Part A of our podcast.
