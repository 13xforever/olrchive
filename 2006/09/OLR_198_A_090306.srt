11
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,600
I'm okay.

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,600
All right, good.

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,580
Dark Sakura is not here tonight.

14
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,420
She is celebrating her anniversary this weekend.

15
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:07,480
They got married on September 1st, so a big congratulations and happy first wedding anniversary

16
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,400
wishes to Dark Sakura and Dan the man, her husband.

17
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,000
Filling in tonight, say hello to an old Orange Lounge Radio favorite, Miklotov.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Hello.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
How you doing?

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm fine.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,280
All right, sounds good.

22
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,600
Well let's not waste a moment here let's get right into how is your gaming week and we're

23
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,480
going to start it off with Loki tonight to tell us about his gaming week when the games

24
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:32,520
he's been playing and what he likes what he hates I've been playing well lots of Saints

25
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,240
Row because that game is awesome I tried a little bit of the online and I think it's

26
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:43,680
I don't know the games that I played were very laggy to the point where they're pretty

27
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,440
much unplayable it's gonna be fun though when they get whatever that you know what's wrong

28
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:53,920
if it worked out. But in the meantime, I don't know, it's okay. I did discover that there

29
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,520
are cheat codes in the game. Granted, cheat codes you can't get achievements for, but

30
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,280
it's fun during lunch hours, you know, and having infinite rockets. So I've been keeping

31
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,160
myself very occupied with that and it's pretty cool driving around like in a big ring and

32
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:16,440
stuff and killing cops and people and just general mayhem. And then other than that,

33
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:22,660
I did try a little bit more of Rumble Rose's XX, and I really don't like that game, but

34
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,680
I have dedicated myself to decide to finish and play it before I saw it back, because

35
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,920
you know, there's unachieved achievement points there that I have to get.

36
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,440
Yeah, except they're kind of hard to get in that game, because that game's not very forgiving.

37
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,440
It's tough.

38
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,440
Yeah, it's pretty tough.

39
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,880
Well, like I tried to finish, I played more Blazing Angels this week, I tried to finish,

40
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,500
you know, the arcade mode.

41
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,480
It's just too damn boring.

42
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,280
I mean, granted you can beat the game by using the cheat codes, you can play through the

43
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,860
game and have god mode and heavy damaging weapons.

44
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:00,580
But it takes like 6 hours to go through the arcade mode because you have to fight 3 waves

45
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,580
of 12 planes.

46
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:06,200
And you have to do that for each plane that's in your collection, which there's 32 of them.

47
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,640
And it takes a very long time.

48
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,840
It's not that it's impossible, it's just so fucking boring.

49
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,640
Be honest, I don't know why they put that even in there.

50
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,720
arcade mode is almost the same as this like mini campaign mode that they have

51
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,760
it's just dumb it's a really really dumb game i'm sorry but it is and i do not recommend it for the

52
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,520
playstation 3 or the wii when it comes out no matter how you know how anxious you might be

53
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:39,280
but the tooth control oh great it'll be hard to control and boring no it really is but the wii nunchucks

54
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,680
It really is a boring game. I mean, I've played through the whole campaign

55
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,680
I finally got s rankings on everything and it is boring almost all the campaigns are exactly the same

56
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,360
There were a couple that were pretty cool

57
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,320
There was some that you're in a flying fortress and actually working, you know

58
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,680
The rotating guns on there that was a cool mission and I wish there was more of it in the game

59
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,760
But there's not there's only that one level and that's it. So oh well, but it's a crappy game now

60
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,760
I have to introduce our always present fourth guest and that is the chat room and if you're listening live on this Sunday night head

61
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,300
on over to www.orange lounge radio.com and click on chat and

62
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,520
Let's see. It was Jeremy Todd one in chat said wait. He was complaining about it being boring if it's boring

63
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,840
Why would you do god mode it would make it even more boring?

64
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,460
Why because I want to get the game over as quick as possible because it is so boring

65
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
You know basically the whole game

66
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,220
requires you to chase after these planes and you have to end up looping around

67
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,940
shooting them looping around shooting them again imagine that for like oh

68
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,540
trust me the missions are long enough as it is I do not want to make them any

69
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:46,700
longer so I'm almost done the game I this is my last achievement I just need

70
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:51,980
to get done then I'll be done with this game I can sell it back and then play

71
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:55,660
more Ridge Racer and I loved you know it's it's a fun game and I really wish

72
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:00,580
there Ridge Racer 7 was coming out on the 360 but it's not and you know sadly

73
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:06,300
Sadly enough, I saw the screenshots for Ridge Racer 7 and it makes me want to get a PS3.

74
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,300
Fuck you Ridge Racer.

75
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,580
No wonder there's a lot of Ridge Racer love from Sony.

76
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,360
It could sell some systems there.

77
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,340
So think about that next time you tell some Ridge Racer jokes, it really does sell systems.

78
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:22,620
It's really sad because seeing some of these screenshots of, not necessarily the first

79
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:28,700
party stuff that they showed at E3, but Ridge Racer 7 and fighting at round 3, it actually

80
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,820
looks pretty good I mean I don't know I'd have to see it in you know actually

81
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:39,060
being played but uh we'll see so that's pretty much oh and of course as usual

82
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,820
the Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories we've been playing we actually

83
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,100
did some races and they actually have a racing and stuff and that's pretty fun

84
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,420
which I should point out you always have something new to complain about that

85
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,740
game yet you can't stop playing it I can't help it I'm addicted all right and

86
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,740
we will be we'll be playing Grand Theft Auto Vice City stories despite the fact

87
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,860
that we know that they probably changed nothing in the multiplayer and if anything it probably

88
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,500
got worse. Alright. Miklotov, how was your gaming week?

89
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,940
What kind of games have you been playing? I actually picked up two games this week.

90
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:16,940
Enchanted Arms and Star Fox DS. And I've played Star Fox DS one time since I've had it and

91
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:22,260
it was only for multiplayer which kinda sucks. Really? I would have thought that it would

92
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:26,460
have been like the reason why that game sells as well as it's doing is

93
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:31,500
because of multiplayer. If it weren't really boring I'm sure it would be a

94
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,740
really good multiplayer game but it kind of sucks a lot and maybe if you had more

95
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,420
than three people like we had playing you can play up to six um that can make

96
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:47,620
it fun but enchanted arms is really cool and I enjoy playing that and I've been

97
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,380
playing Final Fantasy, leveling Blue Mage.

98
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,100
In Final Fantasy XI, specifically?

99
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,780
Yes, like there are any other ones. The rest of them are stupid.

100
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,100
Well, there's a new one called Final Fantasy XII that a lot of people are really excited

101
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,100
about that is out there.

102
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,300
You know what? I don't care. That's not a real Final Fantasy game.

103
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:09,300
Well, technically, yes it is actually a real Final Fantasy game.

104
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,620
Not in my world!

105
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,100
Some would complain that it's actually more of a Final Fantasy game than XI was.

106
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:19,900
There's chocobos and red mages and blue mages and black mages and white mages and whatever

107
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,100
else and it's way more fun.

108
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,540
And red hearts and green clovers and purple horseshoes.

109
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,540
And blue moons.

110
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,540
They're cool.

111
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,540
They taste good.

112
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,540
Lucky charms.

113
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:33,500
I want some lucky charms now.

114
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,500
That's it.

115
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,280
I don't do anything else besides work.

116
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,180
Anything exciting that you've been playing at work lately?

117
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:43,780
For those that are new to the program, Miklotov happens to work for Konami, but he comes

118
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:47,440
You'd be surprised he comes on this show not as a employee though

119
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,680
But as a gamer and a longtime friend of the show, we've known him since before he was working there. So yeah

120
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:59,580
I'm just kidding. Obviously you can't talk about what you're playing. Yeah, not really. Oh, I can tell you I'm playing at work enchanted

121
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:08,060
Wait a minute that was by Ubisoft. Well, I heard the cutest. It's on my TV a lot

122
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,540
So I guess I'm playing it

123
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:14,260
I heard a really funny name for them newbie soft was what I heard. Somebody called him this week

124
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:18,420
And I thought that was really funny for some reason. This is why I don't know made me laugh. I like

125
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,800
You too. Well, as ever didn't they do one

126
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:29,300
That DDR urban game flows here. Yeah flow is kind of cool. I played it. It wasn't that bad

127
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,600
It was not a great game, but it's way better than like I don't know in the groove

128
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,420
Except for a couple songs Sephiroth 1215. What do you think of this comment in our chat room?

129
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,420
I ignored it, is what I thought about it.

130
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:45,420
No, I have to read it here, Final Fantasy XI should have been called Final Fantasy Online and not by a number.

131
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,420
I actually said that when the game first came out.

132
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,420
As much as I love Final Fantasy XI, I actually agree.

133
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:54,420
Yeah, probably, but you know what, it's got a number after it, so...

134
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,420
I'll tell you what though.

135
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,420
I'll just have to cope.

136
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:00,420
When you play XII, XI fits into the series more.

137
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,420
Because the battle system in XII feels like XI merged with the old ones.

138
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,420
It's hard to explain, you just have to play it.

139
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,540
Pick up Dragon Quest VIII and play the demo. I mean, seriously, Dragon Quest VIII is like

140
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,420
twenty bucks now?

141
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:14,120
Seriously, if you are a role-playing fan at any

142
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,820
level, I mean, if you hate role-playing games, Dragon Quest VIII is gonna change your mind,

143
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,780
but if you like role-playing games of any notion,

144
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,940
you gotta play Dragon Quest VIII. You must.

145
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,860
In response to Jeremy Todd's

146
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:28,740
comment about how it's ironic that a couple weeks ago I said I wasn't a gamer,

147
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,420
I'm still not. I'm just, you know, I've got a bad addiction,

148
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,020
and so,

149
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,620
you know, I need help.

150
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,380
And that's it Jeremy tell one in chat is also point boy

151
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,560
You'd think he's the only one in chat with how much we're quoting him tonight

152
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,260
He's saying that Ubisoft is also making Assassin's Creed which was some news this week because you know

153
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:51,100
It's coming out to the 360 shock and awe we all knew that well that that was like totally unexpected

154
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,100
Yeah, but it never came out of nowhere. Yeah

155
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,160
Let's see my gaming week, okay

156
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,960
I'm kind of glad dark soccer is not here tonight

157
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,780
And it's just Loki because I can take on Loki but dark soccer will make me feel like poop if she was here I

158
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:08,720
I rejoined Final Fantasy 11, and I realize what I said on last week's show, but

159
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,040
you don't understand the convincing power that Miklotov has over people.

160
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,920
I am an enabler. I'm really, really good at that stuff.

161
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,800
Can you help me understand it? What is so freaking great about Final Fantasy 11?

162
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,320
Why should more people be playing it?

163
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,680
Um, did you not see my cute little chocobo?

164
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,720
He's so awesome! Because it's cute? Yeah, it's cute, and um...

165
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,760
This is why you guys buy max too. I think I think one of our link shell buddies today put it best though

166
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:43,440
He said something about he we were all looking at the total time spent in the game and you know jazz. He's up to

167
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,640
198 days

168
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,960
Yeah, he's crazy

169
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:53,160
He says probably a quarter of that has been spent looking for party and that is the downside to Final Fantasy 11 big time

170
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:58,120
You have to have a good link shell so that you have a chat room. Yeah, keep you busy

171
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,020
I mean honestly I missed a lot of the people in the chat room on

172
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,960
Chat room the link shell on Final Fantasy 11

173
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:10,520
so I mean that's a good reason to come back and the fact that I was playing again is a good reason to come back and

174
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:15,280
You know that doing all that crap last night to get you those quests was really fun, too

175
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,400
Yeah, we did all the new job quests. I got blue mage Corsair and puppeteer all in one night

176
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:24,620
It was actually kind of fun. I will say this about the game though. They up the graphics on Xbox 360 like they up the resolution

177
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:28,780
it's a slight change you may not even notice it but I did and I think it did

178
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:32,380
make the game look a little better still kind of hard to read the text still

179
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:36,660
takes forever to get logged into the game but you know for the most part I'm

180
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,820
having a good time it is because of the other people to play it and if you are

181
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,140
playing it I would not be back and doings fun isn't it what we've been

182
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,220
doing yeah it's fun it's quick I like playing Corsair because I get to gamble

183
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,900
all day and I get my hit things with blue stuff now for all okay all the

184
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:54,820
chat room is coming to Jamie's defense and calling me addict and yelling at me

185
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,000
calling me a traitor and everything, look

186
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,800
A. I will still be going to Phantasy Star Universe when that comes out so

187
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,960
Final Fantasy XI can kiss my butt while I go play Phantasy Star Universe for a while

188
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:11,040
B. Did you hear me complain the forty times she went back to Ragnarok online?

189
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,000
Don't think so. She quit and went back to WoW as well so you know what we all have

190
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,560
our things

191
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,040
So, suck it. I don't care what you people think. I will game however I want.

192
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,220
Other games I've been playing this week. Another game that I bought that a lot of

193
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,380
people have been going, why would you buy that? Time Pilot

194
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:31,520
on Xbox Live Arcade. Now look, this was one of my favorite 80's games.

195
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,280
Like, it was kinda like my cultish game that I really liked. That and Gyruss.

196
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,960
I know they're both Konami games just by coincidence. Those are like the shooters that I absolutely love.

197
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,720
So, I was really excited to see Time Pilot was coming out the Xbox 360.

198
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,780
It's cool that you can play with original graphics as well as enhanced.

199
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:51,280
The enhanced graphics aren't exactly going to, you know, rock your world by any means.

200
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,580
It's probably Super Nintendo level graphics, but I mean, I guess it's kind of nice to have

201
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,580
them.

202
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:59,220
Otherwise, the game has super easy achievements.

203
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,300
I probably got about eight achievements the first time I played through the game, but

204
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,380
maybe that's just because I played it before, so I kind of, you know, was already decent

205
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,500
at it.

206
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,300
So I don't think there's going to be a lot here that's going to win a person over.

207
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,620
I mean, it's five dollars.

208
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,620
It's not that expensive.

209
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,500
I would say check out the demo.

210
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:19,300
If you like those Geometry Wars-ish shooting games and you want another easy to pick up

211
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,180
shooter, or you're an Achievement Points horror, I think Time Pilot's pretty decent.

212
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,580
I think it's worth a look.

213
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,540
I think the game that they're putting out next week though, Scramble, I think I'm gonna

214
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,980
totally pass on that one.

215
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,140
That was not a Konami game I remember by any means.

216
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,540
I think Gradius should have been the one we were getting instead, but that's just me.

217
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,340
Maybe they're waiting on that one, I don't know.

218
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,340
Whatever.

219
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:41,140
And then the other game I played this week was Enchanted Arms.

220
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,940
I didn't like the game at first.

221
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:47,140
Well, it's not that I didn't like it, I thought it was just like a real average RPG

222
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:54,440
and I was kind of like, okay, am I only liking this because it's the first real next-gen Japanese RPG we're getting?

223
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,640
I don't count Oblivion, you guys, that's more of a PC-based RPG.

224
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,740
More of an American RPG.

225
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:04,640
I don't count Final Fantasy XI because that's not really a next-gen RPG.

226
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:10,740
Yeah, and it's an MMO, so this is really the first Japanese-style RPG we're getting on the Xbox 360.

227
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,620
and because of that the graphics are gorgeous in a lot of places in the game

228
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,620
I don't think it's as good as it could be but I think a lot of the cut scenes

229
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,940
are really really good I think a lot of the battle though looks like PlayStation 2

230
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,220
and some of the graphic stuff annoys me like if you use big

231
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,740
characters in your party sometimes it blocks other characters you can't even

232
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,300
see them

233
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,060
some very basic camera controls could've been put into battle to make it a lot

234
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:35,440
easier to see. The English voice acting

235
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,180
some of it is just downright god awful

236
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:43,020
some of it is really, really bad. But at least they have the Japanese track in there.

237
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:46,260
Exactly, so that's the silver lining is that they left the original

238
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,900
Japanese track in there for you to use.

239
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,060
I have been listening to the English voice acting just because I was, you know,

240
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:51,700
I wanted to

241
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,060
basically review it for the show, but I will probably switch over to

242
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,340
Japanese voice acting a little later on. Otherwise the game itself,

243
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,380
I wouldn't say it's the greatest RPG

244
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,700
or it's even as good as a Final Fantasy style game, but it's

245
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:09,220
It's decent. It's pretty good. I think if you like these types of role-playing games,

246
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:14,380
you're going to like this. The battle system is a little weird. It's half-tactical. Basically,

247
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,820
you move around a 12-square grid and put in your attacks, and you kind of have to think

248
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:21,620
about where your characters are positioned might make it easier for the enemy to attack

249
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:26,740
you. So it's somewhat tactical, but still old-fashioned style as well. There's a lot

250
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:30,540
of customization ability. It kind of has a Pokemon-ish element in it, because there's

251
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,280
There's a hundred different golem creatures you can use.

252
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,500
The story started off very cliche, and it's still a little bit cliche as far as Japanese

253
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,300
RPGs go, but it's getting better.

254
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:44,540
I find that if you stay with the game, up until about, there's a major event that happens

255
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,700
about two hours into the game that has a really gorgeous cutscene with it, and I think the

256
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,820
game gets a lot better after that point.

257
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:55,380
I wanted to ask this, though, because I am a gay gamer, and Miglotov, I know you are

258
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,380
too.

259
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:01,580
getting a lot of talk because it has a gay character in it named Makoto and

260
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:07,260
Makoto is very let's say flamboyant imagine Carson the blonde guy from Queer Eye

261
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:13,180
who's like a bard character he plays a sax or something and he talks like this

262
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:18,660
he talks like James from Pokemon if you've ever watched that show and I'm

263
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:22,740
like wow doesn't yes he does he totally has a voice if anything he talks more

264
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,980
like Xander from drawn together okay well what do you think of this do you

265
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:30,220
think it's a good thing for gay gamers do you think it sets us back two years

266
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:37,460
what do you think it's a bad thing but but I don't I don't like him but I like

267
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:44,500
how they're handling it like how him hanging off Toya nobody seems to care in

268
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:49,220
the game and nobody comments about it so that's pretty cool yeah that's why I

269
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:53,820
What I kind of like is that I don't like him per se, but I like the fact that in the rest

270
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,860
of the world, it's just viewed as a, you know, oh, it's who he likes.

271
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:01,880
And like there's a Toya fan club that you run into in the beginning that has like women

272
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,000
in it and then one other guy in it that's just like a minor character.

273
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,920
You know, they just kind of like that it's just whatever.

274
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,880
You know, it's not one way or the other.

275
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,800
But I think it's very interesting and a very risky thing to do in an Xbox 360 game because,

276
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:18,760
you know, you think of the typical stereotypical Xbox audience, you know, Madden 07 and all

277
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,360
that stuff and I think it would be very shocking and I can imagine a lot of

278
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:28,560
people going ew ew ew gross but I think they need that I think they need that I

279
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:33,760
don't know but I think it's kind of neat so it's it's a step in the right

280
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,280
direction even if the character was done a little over-the-top to put it lightly

281
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:45,760
I think it's a good thing overall and can I do a spoiler no jerk all right

282
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,720
Blaze in our chat room says that's how the world should be. I agree. So you know

283
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,960
maybe it's a utopia view of the world. I don't know. But anyway, those are the

284
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,840
games I've been playing this week. I do kind of recommend Enchanted Arms.

285
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,280
I think if you're into Japanese RPGs and you own an Xbox 360, you really should

286
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,160
take a look at this game. But if you haven't really played these types of

287
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,960
games before, I don't think this is the one that's gonna win you over. But I

288
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,280
think this is a good one to appease fans of Japanese RPGs. Alright, let's get

289
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,440
Let's get into some housekeeping news tonight.

290
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,780
First off, I know some of you folks might be listening tonight for the DDR Power Previews

291
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:26,680
which we were promoting, and if you've noticed on Orangelauntrader.com, we were requested

292
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,080
earlier this week by Konami to suspend that for the time being.

293
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,680
Some things are going on behind the scenes where they just weren't ready for us to do

294
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,680
that.

295
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:39,480
So we're hoping that, and I don't know why, there's a million reasons we can theorize,

296
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,480
but long story short, it's just not happening tonight.

297
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,440
The good news is it does look like we will be getting to debut some type of new tracks

298
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,920
from UltraMix 4 and Universe.

299
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,400
Konami of Hawaii has been really good in working with us.

300
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,120
I think we will have something possibly as soon as next week, so keep your eyes peeled

301
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,120
on the website.

302
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,680
I do think it's going to happen in one form or another, and you will hear new songs that

303
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,800
you have not heard yet here on Orange Lounge Radio and over on AllGames.com, so just stay

304
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,800
tuned to the website.

305
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,380
I apologize for anyone that was tuning in, ready to hear it tonight.

306
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,220
things happen it's beyond our control I especially feel bad for any folks

307
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,540
because I know it got picked up on a bunch of Japanese game news sites and

308
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:23,340
they may not have gotten the translation from the latest news tonight so no DDR

309
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:27,820
power previews tonight again apologies hopefully it will happen next week

310
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:33,340
Konami asked us to not do it it's beyond our control sorry so stay tuned the site

311
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:38,660
other housekeeping news it is a three-day weekend and if you've been in

312
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,660
in our chat room tonight, you'll know that Loki and myself have started the drinking

313
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,660
tonight.

314
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,100
Now, a few things I want to say about drunk shows.

315
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:51,500
A, we do this because we can, because people out there say, oh, professionals shouldn't

316
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,500
drink while we're on the job.

317
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,620
Well, we're not professionals, and we're perfectly fine with that, so shove it.

318
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,580
And the other thing is that people say, wait a minute, Rob, aren't you being a little bit

319
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:03,520
of a hypocrite, because last week you were saying, you were criticizing those folks that

320
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,060
had gone to the press event and were drinking at the press event.

321
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,300
Well, there's a big difference here, you see.

322
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,020
That's because they were drinking in someone else's house.

323
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:15,140
If we were guests on, let's say, Scott's show, Bobby's show, whatever podcast they

324
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,140
want to have us on.

325
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,420
Loke, do you think we'd go on their show drunk?

326
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,460
No, unless they were doing it.

327
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:25,100
No, unless they asked us to, but really, we would probably not do that.

328
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:29,700
We would have the respect to be our professional self, but while we're in our own house,

329
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,020
we can do whatever we want.

330
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,660
So that's the difference.

331
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,640
If you want to call us a hypocrite after hearing that, whatever, I don't care.

332
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,860
The other thing I want to say is that, again, please, if you do drink, drink responsibly.

333
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,600
Loki and I, Loki has other transportation.

334
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,600
The wife is here.

335
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,600
He will not be driving.

336
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,560
I live here at the studio, so I will not be driving.

337
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,840
Miklotov is here to babysit.

338
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,840
He's not drinking either.

339
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,840
No.

340
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,360
And actually, Loki's wife has told him that if he throws up at all tonight, he will be

341
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,360
spending the night in my bed.

342
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,680
It would be a little weird.

343
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,840
I do not want to see throw up tonight, so please don't.

344
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,840
We'll be fine.

345
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,840
We'll take it easy.

346
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,840
Yeah, exactly.

347
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,960
it kinda after the whole bachelor party thing, it's made me

348
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,240
it's made it hard for me to drink actually just because

349
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,160
I'm such in that mental mindset now where it's gross to even drink

350
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,040
it was hard enough to start drinking orange juice again

351
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:22,200
cause you know all I drink you know for those who don't know is screwdrivers

352
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,520
except tonight I've actually switched with Rob he's drinking screwdrivers and I'm

353
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,880
drinking some watermelon thing

354
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,920
even that is pretty tough

355
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,360
for me to drink and it's just like all mental right now so I'm not trying to

356
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,280
overdo it at all. In fact, I'm pretty sure I'm probably not going to get too drunk tonight,

357
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:44,880
so whatever. I just don't have a salt shaker around me to be able to down them super fast

358
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,880
like I used to.

359
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:51,720
Alright, so you know, you folks at home, if you're under 21, you shouldn't be drinking.

360
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,320
Don't drink alone, because when you drink alone for fun, that might be a sign of a problem.

361
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:02,180
I don't know. There's a difference between one glass of wine and other stuff, but I've

362
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,620
I've just known people who've had a problem in my past and it's not an easy thing to do.

363
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:09,180
The other thing I was thinking about bringing over but I didn't, I was going to get drunk

364
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,180
off a kosher wine.

365
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,180
Which would have been funny.

366
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,180
That would have been funny.

367
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:17,620
Alright, anyway, let's get into some gaming news, shall we?

368
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,620
Yes, we shall.

369
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,620
And we have some exclusives tonight, right Loki?

370
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,620
We have lots of stuff.

371
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,620
Awesome.

372
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,620
What happened?

373
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,620
How did you land so many exclusives this week?

374
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:28,260
Well once a year, actually we started this last year, we have the game publishers out

375
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,640
to basically give us their rundown of the fourth quarter.

376
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:36,740
It's quite brief usually, but it is a two day event and we have like a party the night

377
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,700
before where they get all drunk and stuff.

378
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,700
That's always fun.

379
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:45,840
And then we do these kind of like 15 minute sales meetings and each person talks to us

380
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,980
about what's coming out and we get to ask them questions and they get to tell us stuff

381
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,440
that may not be common knowledge.

382
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,480
So starting things off here, which is actually kind of cool.

383
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,880
This year for the first time we had Nintendo come out.

384
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,600
So obviously the question on everyone's mind, when the hell is the week coming out?

385
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,600
When is this coming out?

386
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:09,960
And to be honest, the guy was very tight-lipped about it, except for a few things.

387
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,340
It is most definitely going to be announced on the 14th.

388
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:18,520
He said it's actually going to be announced in Japan as well at the same time, which is

389
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,200
kind of funny because the news story came out afterwards about that same...

390
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,460
I was going to say it lines up with a story that came out later this week that said they're

391
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:27,240
going to have multi-regional press events, so that makes sense.

392
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,480
So he has confirmed though it is going to be a November launch.

393
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,780
He said 100% November launch.

394
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,720
This is based on his knowledge and what he knows so far.

395
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,720
So ouch.

396
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:42,020
So the October 18th date that we were so certain of just got shot down this week.

397
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,020
What went wrong?

398
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,360
Why were we wrong on October 18th?

399
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:50,020
We were wrong because the launch right now, he doesn't know exactly when it is.

400
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:54,280
It's November, but they're trying to time it either two weeks before the PS3 launch

401
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,280
or a week after.

402
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:59,040
because they don't want their thunder being stolen by Sony.

403
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,040
The thing is...

404
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,640
So wait, you're telling me Nintendo themselves doesn't even know when they're launching

405
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,280
this system as of yet?

406
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,400
Well, he hasn't been told the final date yet.

407
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,640
The reason why is they're waiting on the amount of units that they have in production.

408
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,020
They're making sure that they have enough to launch because they're doing a worldwide

409
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:22,620
launch, and that's pretty much it, but it will not delay the launch past Thanksgiving.

410
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:27,060
So it will be before, you know, that gives you a pretty good range there of when it's

411
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,060
going to be.

412
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:31,420
So if Nintendo themselves doesn't even know the launch date, or at least maybe a very

413
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:35,260
very few select people know it at this point inside Nintendo, would it be safe to say that

414
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:39,580
any story you have read on the internet about launch date today is bullshit, including the

415
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,580
one we ran?

416
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,580
Yeah.

417
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,580
Okay.

418
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:46,180
And mine, remember mine was just purely speculation because of the anniversary and all that stuff.

419
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:49,560
But that would make sense because if Nintendo themselves has kind of not really known the

420
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:54,500
date they wanted to do based on units, which would explain why they didn't do anything

421
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,500
at E3.

422
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,500
And you know what?

423
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,500
The whole thing could be a ruse.

424
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,500
The whole thing could be a ruse.

425
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,500
They could go, you know what?

426
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,780
We're launching in two weeks, you know, after the whole press event.

427
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:05,140
So it's possible this guy at your event was just yanking your chain with the whole thing.

428
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,240
I don't think he's yanking my chain.

429
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,460
I think this is actually what he knows, and to be honest, I would think that they're not

430
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,460
launching in November.

431
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,500
It makes sense because, you know, you want to make sure you have the most units so you

432
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,380
can sell as much as possible so you don't run into the shortages.

433
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:21,240
Some interesting stuff though, they are spending 30 million dollars in marketing this thing.

434
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,200
That's twice as much as the GameCube.

435
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,380
So it's definitely going to be out there.

436
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,440
They're not going to have in-store kiosks.

437
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,360
The reason why they're not is because of the setup issues with this thing.

438
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:36,100
Because it has that sensor bar, it would make it very difficult for them to be able to set

439
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:40,480
up and they want to make sure that they have people viewing it in the correct way.

440
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,720
So wait a minute, I distinctly remember seeing a story on Digg earlier this week that were

441
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,720
mockups of a Playstation 3 and a Wii kiosk.

442
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,040
Bullshit, you're saying.

443
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,060
Based on what you heard here it's bullshit.

444
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:54,320
According to what he knew it's bullshit but I think, I really do think that they are,

445
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,880
they've got to have in-store kiosks but I don't know.

446
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,000
You know the other thing too?

447
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
That kiosk could have been mockup for a convention kiosk or something like that.

448
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,460
Because they have you know their kiosks at conventions and stuff like that.

449
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,300
I'm sure they're gonna have something in store.

450
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:13,580
I don't know why they wouldn't but according to him they're not because it'd be hard

451
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,580
for them to set up.

452
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:19,140
think that they will, but whatever. There is one interesting thing. They're going the

453
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:23,640
Xbox route with the DVD player in it. It's going to be an add-on and not included in

454
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:28,680
the box. So you've got to get this extra dongle or whatever to put on it to be able to play

455
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:34,440
DVDs. But, his thought on it was, who doesn't own a DVD player by now? I mean, seriously.

456
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:39,840
Everybody owns a DVD player. It's not a big deal. So, that's kind of neat.

457
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:46,040
Moving on from Nintendo a little bit to Midway and this was kind of interesting.

458
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:49,320
Wait, has that DVD player rumor been announced anywhere?

459
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,320
I don't know.

460
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,320
Interesting.

461
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:55,840
Here is something interesting from Midway and I asked them twice when I heard this.

462
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,800
Blitz the League for the Wii is not coming out.

463
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,760
Not coming, not happening, definitely not at launch.

464
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,960
It is cancelled as far as they are concerned.

465
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,200
So not happening.

466
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,900
They are basically concerned with launching Rampage.

467
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:14,560
Rampage, I guess, is going to be their big title for, I don't know, the launch, which

468
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,700
is kind of stupid because Rampage really sucked as a game.

469
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:24,900
But anyways, kind of moving on here, our friends at Activision, we're talking to them, and

470
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:30,020
this is actually, I saw the story, you know, about Guitar Hero 2, the bundle will be coming

471
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,420
with a red guitar controller, which is kind of cool.

472
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:38,020
They said the next Guitar Hero after 2 will be for the 360, which is pretty sweet.

473
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:42,740
They're also saying according to what they've heard about the PlayStation 3 online service,

474
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:47,220
it will not be free, which is also interesting.

475
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:52,300
Now speaking with Konami, they were saying that Castlevania Portrait of Ruin is actually

476
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:57,620
delayed until early December, which is interesting.

477
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:01,260
Also and I have asked him twice about this because this didn't make sense and I don't

478
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:05,940
know Shane if you know anything about this he said that for universe all the

479
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:10,200
song packs from Ultramix the Ultramix series will be transferable to

480
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:18,340
universe I never heard that yeah that was interesting because I asked I'm like

481
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:22,380
are you sure how would that be possible exactly that didn't make any sense to me

482
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:25,780
I'm thinking this guy might have been confusing Ultramix for it because that

483
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:29,780
would make sense but I like maybe Ultramix for in universe have the same

484
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:33,860
song packs or something. Maybe. Maybe they're gonna have the same sound packs later on.

485
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:37,540
But I asked them again, I'm like, are you sure? I'm like, that seemed a little weird.

486
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:43,140
He said, yes, universe will be able to play the song packs from UltraMix. I'm like, okay,

487
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:48,540
so take that with a grain of salt. Okay, DarkTisker brings up a good point in chat room. UltraMix

488
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:53,280
1-4 aren't on the backward compatibility list, so how would that work? I don't know. Unless

489
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,280
plan on re-releasing the song packs or something?

490
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,280
Huh.

491
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,280
I don't see.

492
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:05,640
Anyways, um, let's see here.

493
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:11,520
According to Sega, Phantasy Star Universe, on the 360 there will be no charge for the

494
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,040
online service, which is pretty good.

495
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:18,480
There will be a charge, a monthly fee for Playstation 2 and PC users, so that kinda

496
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,480
sucks for them.

497
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:25,540
almost be worth it for me to get a 360 again, just to get PSU with no monthly charge.

498
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:29,760
Sonic the Secret of the Rings, or you might remember Sonic Wildfire, not a launch title

499
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:36,920
for the Wii. Coming March 2007, so look for that then, there will not be full auto 2 on

500
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:44,860
the Xbox 360 at all. Not later, not ever. Because the first one didn't sell very well,

501
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:48,900
so they're not bringing it back.

502
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,900
I wonder why they think that it will sell well on the PS3.

503
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:56,160
Well, they're not sure, they're just trying a different audience, so that's really what

504
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,160
it is.

505
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:02,880
This is really weird because in the scope of about five minutes, you've contradicted

506
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,700
about seven different news stories that have ran out there previously.

507
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,260
I know, what can I say?

508
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,260
Okay.

509
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:13,620
I hope you're right or we're going to look stupid.

510
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:16,220
So marketing people could be wrong and therefore you're wrong.

511
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,220
Yeah.

512
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,220
So at least we have an out.

513
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,500
These are not marketing people.

514
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,660
These are sales associates.

515
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:23,100
These are vice presidents of sales and stuff.

516
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,060
So I would assume that they know what they're talking about.

517
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,060
Alright.

518
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,060
Fair enough.

519
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,360
LucasArts, which is awesome, they came out.

520
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,500
The Wii Star Wars game is in development, will not be done until late 2007 or early

521
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,500
2008.

522
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,800
They want to make sure they get it right because they have a rabid fan base of Star Wars fans

523
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:43,600
and you know, obviously they mix it with rabid Wii fans and they want to make sure they don't

524
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,040
fuck this up. So that's mainly the case. The next gen Star Wars game is going to be coming

525
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:53,620
in fall of 2007. And also Indiana Jones the next gen game will be released at the same

526
00:30:53,620 --> 00:31:01,740
time as the new movie, which is confirmed in pre-production from them. Let's see here.

527
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:07,280
I had Vinvetti, they were talking about the Scarface game and one of the funny bits of

528
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:12,380
trivia from it is that the voice actor that they picked for Tony Montana is actually Al

529
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,060
Al Pacino's driver.

530
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:20,660
And apparently because Al Pacino can't do Tony's voice anymore due to his age, so apparently

531
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,260
his driver can mimic the character's voice.

532
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:27,540
Say hello to my little friend.

533
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,100
Now here's some really interesting stuff.

534
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,100
Ubisoft.

535
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:34,820
GT, that racing game that they announced, it's going to come with a steering wheel add-on

536
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,920
for the Wii.

537
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,380
And this is going to be something that you plug the Wii controller in the middle of it?

538
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,380
Yes you do!

539
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,380
That is hot!

540
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:50,140
You do not need it to play it, but you do not need it to play the game, but it will

541
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:53,860
be just something that you can slap the controller into to play it, which I thought that was

542
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,860
very cool.

543
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:59,100
You know, someone actually thinking about how to use the system.

544
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,420
There is a new Prince of Persia game coming for the PSP.

545
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:06,020
It's going to be based on the Two Thrones game that was out last fall.

546
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:10,540
It'll feature multiplayer and new chariot races.

547
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:14,300
the working title is just Prince of Persia. So they haven't really made an announcement yet.

548
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:18,700
Now for once that lines up with something I did read on the rest of the internet a couple weeks

549
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:23,340
ago. That was actually the DS one that you're reading about, I think. Far Crying in the We

550
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:27,740
looks pretty awesome from what I've seen so far. The pictures look pretty cool, the screenshots, so

551
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:33,660
that was pretty neat. Koei. Blade Storm the Hundred Years War not coming out at launch,

552
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:39,500
it's going to be quarter one of 2007 and I guess it is in the launch window, but whatever.

553
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:44,700
uh... guitar man lives gonna have online play and new songs that's hot

554
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,020
uh... which is not already come out

555
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:52,100
and you know how it may be in your honor but it's coming up october here

556
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,400
new romance of the three kingdoms game coming on the playstation two quarter

557
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:59,100
one a quarter to two thousand seven which should be interesting

558
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,020
now the big one

559
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,580
microsoft

560
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,900
no price drops no bundles

561
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:07,240
whatsoever for three sixty they're not worried because the competition is two

562
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:11,840
$200 more expensive than them. In fact, they were unaware that Canada, because Canada kind

563
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,220
of operates a little bit independent than the US, Microsoft was doing a bundle until

564
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:22,600
after it had been announced. And much hate mail was exchanged according to our rep. Gears

565
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:27,360
of War is coming out November 7th, not November 12th. November 12th is actually emergency,

566
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:34,920
which is their big marketing push. Wait, that makes absolutely no sense at all. Why would

567
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:38,680
they have all this huge hype over Emergence Day, Emergence Day, and then you're telling

568
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,760
me the game's coming out five days earlier?

569
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,560
The game is coming out on the 7th because you can't really launch a game on a Wednesday.

570
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,600
That's when everybody's getting in the game is on the 7th.

571
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,240
Now stores, you know, some stores are waiting until the 12th because they're confused on

572
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,880
this Emergence Day thing, but the Emergence Day is when they're gonna be doing all the

573
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,800
big ad pushes, the, you know, their campaigns, they're playing with fame type thing.

574
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,360
Could it be like, cause didn't Halo launch on a Friday?

575
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,180
So could it be like that where maybe the stores are getting it that day but they're not supposed

576
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:08,700
to sell it until the 12th? No, according to him, they can sell it when they get it. And

577
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:13,640
this was also kind of ties in with another story that we had earlier about the same thing.

578
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:17,300
And I can confirm that it's always been the 7th, but I thought it was weird that they

579
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:23,480
were selling it on a Sunday. This is the best one right here. Halo 3. Now everybody thinks

580
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:29,500
it's coming out in the fall of 2007. No. March or April of 2007 is the date for Halo

581
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:36,740
three what that is they said it's ready to roll in March or April so I would

582
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:42,340
they be sitting on that I don't know but that's are you sure you didn't pull this

583
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:46,980
out of your ass that I did not pull it out my ass I asked him world we cuz we

584
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:50,820
asked him about hail three do you have a date on hail three he's all he's all

585
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:55,900
it's gonna be April March or April of 2007 he's all it's not gonna be the fall

586
00:34:55,900 --> 00:35:00,300
if I was a betting man I'd say it's you know the end of spring so okay but you

587
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,180
know what that doesn't sound like he knew for sure because he says if I was a

588
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:08,260
betting man I would do did it so I cuz they may why would you launch a game I

589
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:13,100
don't know April especially before e3 or whatever well here's here's my thought

590
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:17,100
on it yeah I think even though I know everything the same thing this year but

591
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:21,220
this makes perfect sense when you think about it this way no I'm not sure about

592
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:25,700
Microsoft but a lot of game companies the big pushes are either in quarter

593
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:32,180
4 of 2007 for our quarter 4 of the year for the Christmas push and March because

594
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:36,340
that's the end of their fiscal year so if you think about it if this game comes

595
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:42,860
out the end of their fiscal year that looks pretty good numbers wise huh okay

596
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:47,940
okay just something to think about the 79 99 vision camera bundle that's gonna

597
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:51,420
coming on is actually replacing 12 month live bundle that's out there right now

598
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:55,420
so that's gonna be the new 12 month bundle that you're gonna be getting he

599
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:59,840
I wouldn't mention what three games were in it, but I think that's already been out anyways.

600
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:06,720
And then finally we have Atari, Alone in the Dark is set for mid-2007, they're not releasing

601
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,440
the game until it's perfect because according to our rep and his words, they've already

602
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,020
ruined enough franchises, and it will be episodic.

603
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:20,220
Test Drive Unlimited, which is coming out actually next week, will be getting download

604
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:26,360
packs each month. They're planned up until June of next year so far. The first two packs

605
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:31,000
will be Lexus cars. There's no word of these cars, they're going to be free, but Lexus

606
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,560
paid a quarter million dollars to get the cars in the game. It says all the download

607
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:42,840
packs will range from free to $7.99 or the Microsoft equivalent in points. That's all

608
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:48,920
the big news from our wonderful meetings. You know, Nintendo Maniac 64 has a good point.

609
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:54,460
came out March it's the end of their fiscal year and that I mean I would

610
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:58,060
think that they would wait until the fall I mean but then again maybe they

611
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:02,620
want to make sure that you know people because think about this Microsoft is

612
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:06,540
doing something big around the PlayStation 3 launch just some sort of

613
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:10,580
announcement or event what if that announcement is the halos coming out in

614
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:14,300
March then people that we're gonna buy a PlayStation 3 they're gonna wait until

615
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:19,140
this game comes out that's that's it

616
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:22,700
wow so maybe that's just the liquor

617
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,540
talking but that makes a lot of sense

618
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,540
now that you put it that way

619
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,240
I don't know what okay would you say if

620
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,300
November goes by and we still haven't

621
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,700
heard anything that maybe something's up

622
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,940
I think if they're going to announce

623
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,440
anything it's going to be a big it's

624
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,140
going to be a halo 3 announcement me is

625
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:40,020
going to be huge but I don't know I mean

626
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,700
it makes sense I mean you would because

627
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,020
people are like well there's you know

628
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:48,140
Gears of War is awesome, but, you know, I really want Halo 3, you know, I might be getting

629
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:52,260
a PlayStation 3 because Resistance looks pretty good, then I'll announce, oh by the way,

630
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:56,300
Halo's coming out in a few months, you know, then people are like, okay, well I can wait.

631
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,020
Or I'll buy a 360 now, you know, that kind of thing.

632
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,020
I don't know.

633
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,780
That would be just downright evil, but kind of funny.

634
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:06,620
Well, didn't they say that they were going to, well they were always saying that they

635
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:09,460
were going to release Halo 3 on the...

636
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:13,420
Yeah, but I think then everybody realized realistically that can't happen, if Halo

637
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:18,980
is going to be really good yeah wow but alright we'll see I mean I don't know

638
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,780
take it with a grain of salt but that that's straight from the mouths of

639
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:27,740
people they're working for these companies you know turbo punk in chat

640
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:35,100
pure evil I'd expect no less from micro macro shaft so I don't know it was

641
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:39,140
interesting we were very excited I tried to get more out of the Microsoft guy but

642
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:43,300
he kind of wanted to talk about stuff that already come out oh no he's weird

643
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:51,940
Wow. Lots of juicy tidbits there. We will post all this stuff in that thread that we have going,

644
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:56,380
the under-the-radar thread, so you'll have that for reference in case this stuff actually...

645
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,740
Or he's wrong. He's downright wrong.

646
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,940
Yeah, whatever, you know.

647
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:03,220
Alright, well this is coming from salespeople. I mean, yeah, sales?

648
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,260
Salespeople, yeah.

649
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,220
I have those sales.

650
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:11,260
Alright, well one thing we do know about Xbox Live Arcade is that we have this new game that's going

651
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:16,100
to be coming out and it's called Space Giraffe. Now usually I'd laugh at a game called Space

652
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:20,460
Giraffe, but what looks pretty awesome about it is that it looks a lot like Tempest, but

653
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:24,920
a lot trippy, kind of like how Geometry Wars was. Now I remember seeing a screenshot for

654
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:28,860
this game that had a lot of really dirty words on it, but I can't seem to find that anymore.

655
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,460
I remember that one, yeah. I don't know if that was photoshopped or what, but...

656
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,780
No. No? That's disgusting.

657
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,820
And exactly what the guy did, Tempest 2000.

658
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:38,420
Because there were some words in there that actually offended me, and that's hard to do,

659
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:42,360
So hopefully those aren't actually in the game, but we'll see.

660
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,360
That's kind of interesting.

661
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,100
Yeah, there were some pictures posted on LiveJournal or something like that, so that would be pretty

662
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,100
cool.

663
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,100
I love Tempest 2000.

664
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:52,940
I think it's one of the biggest sleeper hits that people don't appreciate, and it was like

665
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:56,100
the reason to own a Jaguar was that game.

666
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,500
So there you have it.

667
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:02,580
I'd be very happy if a game like this came to Xbox Live Arcade more as it develops.

668
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:07,460
There was also a story this week talking about the Xbox 360 soccer exclusive deals that they

669
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:11,460
have going on, talking about how the Xbox 360 is going to be the only place that you're

670
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:16,580
going to be able to get next gen soccer games, or all next gen soccer games I should say,

671
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:23,580
because FIFA is going to be on both systems and, or was it, Pro Evolution Soccer 6 or

672
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:28,100
Winning 11 Pro Evolution Soccer 2007, whatever you want to call it.

673
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:33,660
Here is something that is very interesting though, that's not true.

674
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:40,820
According to Konami, who was also at our event this week, spoke to the rep there.

675
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:48,980
The reason why Pro Evolution Soccer, winning 11, whatever, yeah Pro Evolution Soccer 2007,

676
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:52,300
the reason it's not coming out on the Playstation 3 at launch is because they haven't got the

677
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:57,580
final dev kits yet and because the game's not going to be done until March, or actually

678
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,480
as late as May according to him.

679
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:06,080
So yeah, it's only exclusive because it's not finished.

680
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:11,760
So I'll take it as you will, but I don't know, hmm, interesting.

681
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:17,660
Well one, I don't remember them saying anything at the barbecue about it being exclusive or

682
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:20,320
anything and I would have thought if it was going to be exclusive they would have said

683
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,320
something like that.

684
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:27,440
So, and it seemed like they were, I mean the game was being ported to DS, what else was

685
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,140
was their PSP, and it seemed like they were porting it to other systems anyway, I mean

686
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:34,440
sure for the handhelds they'd be downgraded versions, but...

687
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:40,000
Well, think about it, if they didn't really assign an exclusive deal, and I'm not sure

688
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,020
FIFA's coming out on the PlayStation 3, I would figure it is, but maybe not this year,

689
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,020
I don't know.

690
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:47,360
If that's the case, then there is no soccer game on the...

691
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:55,800
Now, wait, okay, hold on a minute here, because the guy from Microsoft at the Germany convention

692
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,360
went out there and said we have both franchises exclusive

693
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:04,600
so you're saying no according to my rep but then again you know

694
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:08,400
he may be full of shit I don't know huh

695
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,480
I'm just taking Konami's word for it, what can I say?

696
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,960
interesting okay I don't know it's kinda weird

697
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,020
well here's one game we know is not going to be exclusive to either system

698
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:21,880
and shouldn't be a shock at all there is a burnout 5 coming

699
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,880
Oh my God!

700
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,880
Really?

701
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,880
No, it doesn't make any sense.

702
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:29,920
And it's coming to the 360 and the PlayStation 3, who would have thought, sometime in 2007.

703
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,520
Now, Burnout is going to be getting a little bit of a makeover.

704
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,500
It's not just going to be rehash of the old same old Burnout.

705
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,120
Thank you EA.

706
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:42,400
Now this time Burnout will be more of an open world-ish environment.

707
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:48,560
Players will be able to go in and out of menus at every intersection, possibly a crash course

708
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,040
by going through any type of intersection.

709
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:58,760
It's going to be taking place in a town called Paradise City.

710
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,880
Why isn't it coming out for the Wii?

711
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,180
No ideas.

712
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:11,560
They also say, though, EA says, the most explosive pile-ups in the series history.

713
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,280
It is kind of the first true next-gen burnout.

714
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:18,240
The other one was just a souped-up, old burnout.

715
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,280
That's not a big surprise there.

716
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:26,000
It's interesting though, Microsoft Japan is talking about bringing Tokyo Game Show and

717
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,080
Exo 6 home.

718
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:35,920
It sounds like what they did with E3, how they had a bunch of exclusive video and demos

719
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:41,640
and stuff, and I really hope they do that because with the region free, those logins

720
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:45,080
that we have, you can download some pretty cool demos.

721
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:50,100
But yeah, it should be more of that stuff coming around Tokyo Game Show, which is actually

722
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:59,340
only in a few weeks, I mean, the 24th of September, so it should be pretty cool.

723
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:00,340
Can't wait to download some of that.

724
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,340
That should be fun.

725
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:04,700
Well, we kind of already, I mean, it was in our lineup, although we kind of already ruined

726
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:08,540
this story, but just in case you haven't heard, it was officially announced that there will

727
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:14,940
be additional Nintendo conferences held in Japan on September 14th and Europe on September

728
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:19,060
15th, so put it all together and I think that's when you're getting your Wii release date.

729
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:23,280
It looks like they're going to launch this huge, as you put it earlier, $30 million marketing

730
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,580
campaign on this day, or days, because of the dateline and all that stuff messing everything

731
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:29,580
up.

732
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:35,080
And then, of course, it kind of goes on into the Tokyo Game Show, but it should be noted

733
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:40,200
Nintendo usually doesn't attend Tokyo Game Show, so this might be their way of kind of

734
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:44,520
doing it on their own terms of publicity, so not a big surprise.

735
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,960
not a huge surprise. What was a pretty big surprise though was Microsoft released another

736
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:54,400
backwards compatibility update and there was quite a few titles this time actually. They

737
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:59,940
even had some pretty good stuff like Burnout 3 and Dead to the Rights right after I sold

738
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:06,940
back Burnout 3. Thank you Microsoft. Fetal Frame 2, Freaky Flyers if you're into that

739
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:13,120
game, Gauntlet Seven Sorrows, Sid Meier's Pirates, stuff like that. What was interesting

740
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:17,560
though, and this is a first for the backwards compatibility updates, is they've actually

741
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:24,440
made something that was not out yet compatible with the system, including such games as Spy

742
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:29,920
Hunter Nowhere to Run, which is coming out next week, Lego Star Wars 2 on the Xbox, which

743
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,540
that makes no sense since they're releasing the 360 version anyways, and then later on

744
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:40,280
in October you've got Spyro, or Legend of Spyro, A New Beginning, which is interesting

745
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:44,680
that they're actually kind of, you know, forward compatibility, I guess? I don't know.

746
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:49,720
Well, they also had that whole He-Man game was compatible with the 360, and that never

747
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,400
even came out, so that's really far forward into the future.

748
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,920
Yeah, but what if it's one of those things, remember how, like, you know, and I've used

749
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,200
this comparison on this show before when we talk about why certain games on the 360 are

750
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,360
emulated and why they aren't. You know, I don't think the Xbox team went in there with

751
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:09,360
the intention of making Barbie compatible, but because they made, say, Ninja Gaiden compatible,

752
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:14,000
fits the same scheme and you go to old Nintendo emulators, once you make a certain mapper

753
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,960
work, most of the other games that run on that mapper work.

754
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,720
Well here's something interesting.

755
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,440
I was talking actually with Midway about, you know, hey did you guys know that this

756
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,600
game has got to add to the compatibility list today?

757
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:30,720
They're like, no, I didn't hear that but I'm not surprised and they're like, well we actually

758
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,680
know what engine it's built on, it's built on the LA Rush engine, believe it or not.

759
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:40,840
So they're talking about maybe, what was kind of interesting, the thing I got from that

760
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:46,260
is that they might actually make a PSP version of that game, I don't know how well the game

761
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:50,880
is going to do, but because now that they have Rush coming out of the PSP, I thought

762
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,000
that was interesting.

763
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,800
I have to point out this private message I got in chat from Jeremy Todd once.

764
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,320
That's not very private then.

765
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,120
Well, I guess not, but I don't think he'd mind me sharing.

766
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:06,120
He linked me to a story on GoNintendo.com, which talks about the demo unit, which we

767
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,960
talked about a little bit ago for the Wii.

768
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:12,700
And apparently, according to GoNintendo, the picture has turned out to be true due to numerous

769
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:13,880
sources who have informed me.

770
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:17,560
The same image shows up in a packet sent out to EB GameStop employees to get them ready

771
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:18,560
for the unit.

772
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,240
I'm glad to hear that it turned out to be real.

773
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,680
I really like the look of it.

774
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:23,680
I think the whole...

775
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:28,040
To be honest, the guy said, you know, street crews were the way they were going to demo

776
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,120
it and not the units.

777
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:35,040
I mean, I don't know, could I mean like a reduction in the units, or?

778
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,880
I think he was gonna, it was gonna be harder to do than maybe the retail units

779
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,980
just because of the setup that's needed for him. Maybe he was talking about

780
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:45,840
the promotional marketing stuff, they're not doing demoing units like that, like these are

781
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:49,120
we know that EB's and Gamestop have the in-store units that

782
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:52,200
they always have, it's not. And to be honest, to be honest you guys,

783
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:55,320
he was kinda halfway right on some of the stuff

784
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:59,260
like for example he was saying that, yeah because the problem is if he's wrong here

785
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:02,120
then it throws all that other Nintendo stuff into question, you know what I mean? Nothing

786
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:05,200
against you, you're just reporting what you heard, but, you know...

787
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:09,320
I know, but, I mean, he was mistaken on a couple things, like, he thought Tokyo Game

788
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,700
Show went on at, you know, September 14th, so...

789
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:14,840
But then again, he's in the U.S., he doesn't go to Tokyo Game Show, so...

790
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,680
And Nintendo doesn't do Tokyo Game Show, so that would make kind of sense.

791
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:22,320
So all he's hearing, he assumed Tokyo Game Show because he knows that event's coming

792
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:28,720
up and he figures, you know, it's right about the time, uh, whatever, you know, so...

793
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:33,440
But one game that is not going to be backwards compatible, but they're still working on it,

794
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,440
Psychonauts.

795
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:40,980
It was almost ready to ship, or I guess be in this update, but it didn't make the deadline

796
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:45,500
and says we continue to work on all games, and that's coming from the backwards compatibility

797
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:46,500
thing.

798
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:47,500
So, alright.

799
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:54,380
Well look, all this news about contradicting stories from Nintendo and games that aren't

800
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:57,900
still backwards compatible is giving me a headache, or maybe it's just the liquor, I

801
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:02,620
I don't know cuz I'm on my second screwdriver now after a pretty big first one. That's very strong by the way

802
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:06,780
I mixed this really wrong. Oh, well. It makes me a little bit angsty, and you know what that means

803
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:14,660
Time for the F use of the week

804
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,580
Loki why don't you start us off tonight?

805
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:19,800
F you have

806
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,800
These drinks take like ass

807
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:24,100
No offense. I mean

808
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:31,340
but it's kind of like a watermelon thing. Don't make it too strong! Mainly my FU this

809
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:37,360
week goes to people that do not pay attention on the road and who cannot park. And I swear

810
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:40,460
to God every time I see someone on a cell phone I know that they're going to be driving

811
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:46,460
like shit. And you can always tell these people that are veering in and out of lanes, going

812
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:53,020
slow, can't seem to follow the road at all. And then you drive past them and you see they're

813
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:57,300
yapping away on the cell phone. Well fuck them. Also these people that fucking do not

814
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:02,300
take the time to park their cars correctly. You know you get into a parking complex that

815
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:06,940
doesn't have a lot of parking and then all of a sudden you see oh Jackass is over the

816
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:11,620
line he's taking up two spaces because his you know fucking you know Yukon or whatever

817
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:16,660
is too big for a compact space. Well fuck them for trying to park in these goddamn small

818
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:27,100
spaces anyways to you Rob my fu of the week goes to busyness I've been like

819
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:31,260
crazy busy with all this stuff going on and I've had like zero free time

820
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:35,340
especially when it comes to my work life is mostly what I'm talking about here my

821
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:41,860
work life has just been nuts and F you to having this feeling because this is

822
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:48,500
how I felt this is kind of a work story F you to folks that like to leave

823
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:52,580
carrots on the ground and then you kind of hop up to that carrot to take a

824
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:57,060
little bite and then BAM the net comes out and grabs you F you to feeling like

825
00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:04,020
that do I'm I'm hunting wabbits are you a furry no gross meekletov your turn I

826
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:08,060
don't have an F you believe well then F you to meekletov F you to me for not

827
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:12,460
having an FU of this week. How about FU to Megalotov for fucking suckering me back into

828
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:18,140
Final Fantasy 11 and it's... It's awesome because I... the day that you started you're

829
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:21,820
like you're not gonna get me to play this I'm like we'll see and and I didn't even have

830
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:26,140
to coerce you that much and you're just like you wanted to check out how the graphics were

831
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:30,540
on the 360 update and we couldn't get mine to log in so you had to log in you had to pay

832
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:36,140
for it and then you just started playing and it was great. I hate you. And I'm the best.

833
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:40,900
Thanks to Final Fantasy 11. Here's the game. I haven't been playing a lot of on Xbox live this week

834
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:45,940
But I did get it patched because Street Fighter 2 hyper fighting got a patch earlier this week

835
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:52,860
And now what they've done to the patch is that now if a person backs out of a game you get a loss

836
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:57,940
But from what I'm understanding both people get a loss if you back out of the game early

837
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:00,700
So that's not fair to the person who gets screwed

838
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:05,380
But I guess you know it discourages people from backing out at all if someone's going to get a loss

839
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:12,700
So no backing out of the game early, and I think they also address some of those timeout issues and connection things with this patch

840
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:17,100
Why can't they just have another and reset the leaderboards? Why can't they just have a like?

841
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,420
counter for disconnects

842
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:24,540
Instead so you can see okay this person disconnected 500 times. Maybe I do not want to play them

843
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:26,940
I mean come on and it makes sense to me

844
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:34,680
I don't know what doesn't make sense, but I guess makes sense in the eyes of Microsoft. It's a stupid Toyota Yaris

845
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:41,000
Game that's coming out apparently. It's gonna be some sort of adver game and has you

846
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:46,400
Driving I guess the Toyota Yaris, and it's gonna coming to Xbox Live Arcade

847
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:51,360
My guess it's gonna be free, but of course they haven't said yet. I

848
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:55,260
Don't know. What do you guys think about you know games like this?

849
00:52:55,260 --> 00:53:00,100
coming out then the kind of advertise car or something like that. Will I get

850
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:04,340
achievement points for playing it? Yeah, you achievement points for. Well then I think I'll be okay with that.

851
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:10,020
I think it's stupid. If I'm gonna look at an advertisement, not gonna pay $60 to

852
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:14,540
look at it, I'm going to go to the TV or to the movies unfortunately. You know

853
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:17,700
it's bad enough that they fucking have those Yaris fucking movies that are in

854
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:22,780
their official Xbox magazine. Do I really need to play an online game for that too?

855
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:29,380
really why I don't know maybe if it was really customizable I'd play it but

856
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:37,180
probably not it still sounds stupid all right well speculation abounds here on

857
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:41,080
the internet about Windows Vista and they usually we don't talk about a lot

858
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:45,580
of you know non gaming news but this is kind of relevant because you know folks

859
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:49,700
do their gaming's on PC and I know we don't talk enough huh and you also have

860
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:52,020
Direct X 10, which is going to be fucking awesome for gaming.

861
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:55,880
Right, and I'm just saying we don't talk a lot about PC games on this show, and I apologize

862
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:56,880
for that.

863
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:57,880
It's just we're so busy with consoles.

864
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:01,300
But we do try to talk about big things in the computer gaming world, and this would

865
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:04,860
certainly be one of them, even if it is about an operating system, and it's about Windows

866
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:05,860
Vista.

867
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:11,120
Now, apparently, Microsoft Canada actually spilled the beans on their website about how

868
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:16,120
much each tier of Windows Vista is going to cost, and this was converted to U.S. dollars

869
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:21,160
from Canadians, and once you boil it down, it looks like the full version of Vista Home

870
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:26,520
Basic will be $233, and Vista Ultimate will be $449.

871
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:32,760
Now if you're upgrading from something previous, Vista Home Basic will be $116, Premium $179,

872
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:36,540
Business $224.83, and the Ultimate $269.93.

873
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:41,360
It should be noted that Microsoft Canada has since removed the listing, and they said,

874
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:45,320
quote, a number of pricing models are undergoing consideration internally, however, nothing

875
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:48,560
has been finalized Microsoft is currently finalizing its pricing model

876
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:51,640
and we'll have more to share at a later date man I'm starting to get the

877
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:56,040
impression that Microsoft Canada's kind of retarded just because of the whole

878
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,440
you know they did the bundle thing when they weren't supposed to and all that

879
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,080
other stuff yeah well I don't know that kind of makes them cool that they're

880
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,600
doing stuff and they're not supposed to I don't think that makes a retard I think

881
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:09,160
it makes them great I don't know whatever I think it's kind of funny so maybe it's

882
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:12,240
just because I'm still having those residual I'm gonna move to Canada

883
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:16,260
some day feelings because I just I love Vancouver so much what can I say whatever

884
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:20,180
all right well we love you guys who choose to email us every week so much

885
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:23,740
and we like to read your emails and even though dark soccer is not here this week

886
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:27,180
that's not gonna prevent me from borrowing her gear and jumping into the

887
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:34,580
mailbag at mailbag at orange launch radio.com email numero uno comes to us

888
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:39,420
tonight from somebody from Vancouver Canada go figure actually Vancouver

889
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:44,540
island there's a difference you see the island is out anyway forget it this

890
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:49,920
comes to us from Wyatt dear dark Sakura sky and Loki today when I downloaded one

891
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:54,220
of my favorite game podcasts I found that the longtime hosts had suddenly

892
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:58,380
left the program and replaced themselves with two guys who are completely new it

893
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:02,180
just wasn't the same so I switched my iPod over to Orange Lounge radio and

894
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:06,660
listen thankfully to your three familiar voices the point is a podcast is only as

895
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:09,280
good as the people who host it, and yours is a great one.

896
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:13,380
The fact that you all know what you're doing, coupled with Loki's industry knowledge, Dark

897
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:17,880
Sakura's butt-kicking-ness, whenever her car is brought up anyway, and the way that Sky

898
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:30,320
is, well, is Sky, all leads to an awesome show that is well worth the three hours a

899
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,120
week spent on listening to you guys.

900
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:36,640
So Dark Sakura, here is your worshipping that you asked for, I will pass that along to her.

901
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:40,440
Here's a lot for what you do for us loyal listeners, and here's for years more of the

902
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,440
same.

903
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,440
P.S.

904
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,660
Sky, you should come to Canada more often.

905
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:48,040
If you think that the maple syrup cookies sold on Granville Island are good, you should

906
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:51,000
try the, I don't know what they're called, but basically they are maple syrup thrown

907
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,440
into snow and then eaten like a piece of maple syrup thrown in the snow.

908
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,160
Thanks a lot, you guys.

909
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,740
Maybe if I come in the winter, I'll have to try that.

910
00:56:58,740 --> 00:56:59,740
That sounds like a winter treat.

911
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:02,300
I think if I try to eat that in the summer, that might be kind of weird.

912
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,660
But thank you very much for the email.

913
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:07,840
You know, I might know which podcast you're talking about, because I keep tabs on a few

914
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:11,260
that are going on, and you know, it's tough.

915
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:15,640
Things change, our personal lives change, and sometimes, you know, it just affects what's

916
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,640
going on.

917
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:20,480
And as much as I would love to do Orange Lounge Radio forever, you know, there might come

918
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:26,500
a time where I have to move for work, Dark Soccer has to move, Loki's got to go somewhere,

919
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:29,460
you know, and we would like to think that we would keep the show going.

920
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:34,360
So I applaud the other shows that try to keep on going despite the other little setbacks

921
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:38,140
to go on and I want to continue to support independent radio my advice you

922
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:41,440
know if it's new people that have been thrown into it give them a couple weeks

923
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:45,600
to warm up because I'll tell you what this shit ain't easy I realize it seems

924
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:48,880
like it's easy because you hear all these shows and you form opinions on

925
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,840
them but the difference between like doing and listening is really really

926
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:59,040
really different and trust me it raises it raises my perception of independent

927
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:03,160
podcasts just so much more by doing one of my own so you know give them a chance

928
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:06,500
So I bet you that same thing that you liked before will come back

929
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:10,900
But if you know not we appreciate the fact that you check us out and support us and the fact that you're supporting

930
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,540
Independent radio at all is awesome

931
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:17,700
So I hope I hope things go good for you and the shows that you're listening to let's go to a new email

932
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:24,720
This person did not sign their email. So I will let's see. I'll just call them Tolu because I think that's what

933
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:27,460
That's what it says in the email is the first name

934
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:35,180
So anyway, here's the email the subject in support of the PSP because of the uninformed bashing and Ninty fanboys

935
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:38,860
We asked for emails like this. So here you go

936
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:43,700
Over the last couple months the Sony bashing in the news has become almost unbearable

937
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:47,780
They bash the PSP saying that it has no good games or just ports

938
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:52,720
Well, the DS has just as many for example Animal Crossing new Super Mario Brothers

939
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:59,180
Brothers, Castlevania, WAIT you can go outside the castle, Innovative, Metroid, etc, sorry,

940
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:02,920
I want a deeper experience instead of minigames or games from 15 years ago.

941
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:09,320
I like Syphon Filter, Daxter, Tekken, Metal Gear Solid, LocoRoco, Wipeout, and GTA, not

942
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,780
Mario again.

943
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:13,360
Ninty fans don't care though.

944
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:14,360
There's that email.

945
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:19,920
Now, I appreciate your perspective, because I think this guy does bring up a point, is

946
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,800
that a lot of people say the PSP is the same shit over again and then run off to play the

947
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:27,920
newest Mario game. Wait, he brought up another point though too. What? He's wrong. No, hold

948
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:31,440
on, hold on. But I do have to say, okay, wait a minute though, because the games that you

949
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:35,440
mentioned at the end there, Tekken, Metal Gear Solid, Wipeout, Grand Theft, those are

950
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:40,440
all franchises too that get a new game every year, so I don't know if that's the best

951
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:46,520
perspective. Hold on, hold on. Okay, now, I agree there's not a lot on the PSP, but

952
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:52,520
And then again, I do own a PSP and to be honest, I play more on my PSP than I do on my DS.

953
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:56,420
And he's right in most aspects, but he's also wrong in some stuff too.

954
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:59,520
He's right in the fact that there are a lot of games that are just ports, I mean Super

955
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:07,100
Mario 64 for the DS, Animal Crossing, not quite a port, more of like kind of an upgrade

956
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:10,880
to the current game, but still not very different to where it's like a different game.

957
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,740
I don't know.

958
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:13,740
That's different.

959
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:17,580
getting some exclusive games like, you know, you've got the Tony Hawk American Skate Land

960
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:22,020
and the new Downhill Jam that's gonna be coming out. They are getting, like, some exclusive

961
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:27,460
new games and stuff. Castlevania, yeah, Castlevania is pretty much Castlevania. It is a new game.

962
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:32,060
It's not a port of, like, say, Castlevania 2 or something like that. So that's new. And

963
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:35,940
for long-time fans of the series, getting to go outside the castle is something new,

964
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:40,860
but I get your point. Now, for the PSP, though, you have the same thing. I mean, PSP Tekken

965
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:45,860
Dark Resurrection, it's a port of the arcade game, it's also a port of Tekken 5, but still

966
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:50,220
it's good to have a fighting game on, you know, the PSP. Also you've got like all these

967
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:55,060
collections that are coming out, like you've got the Capcom Puzzle Collection, which is,

968
01:00:55,060 --> 01:01:01,140
you know, ports of old games. My biggest gripe with, you know, Sony, I mean we'll get Twisted

969
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:05,100
Metal head-on, which is a port of Twisted Metal 2, I mean that is a blatant port of

970
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:10,560
the game, they didn't change really anything other than adding online multiplayer. But,

971
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:15,480
know in the same aspect I think both the laziness in portable games is really a

972
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:18,880
big problem because not a lot of people look at it and even Grand Theft Auto is a port of

973
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:24,640
just grant I mean that's a big port if it's just Grand Theft Auto 3 and now now

974
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:28,680
Eddie in our chat room of the oil army asked what's wrong with ports exactly

975
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:33,320
that's the thing what is wrong for its people like games that are ported I was

976
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:37,560
hoping for a little bit better of a game you know twisted metal head-on you know

977
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:42,120
I wanted it to be a new game and it was just the old game all over against GS

978
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:47,740
68 brings up an interesting counterpoint in our chat room right there also the oil army ports render the original obsolete

979
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:51,720
Not on portables because that way I can play my favorite games on the go

980
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:55,800
I don't need a TV or system in the car or on the train, right?

981
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:59,160
But the it renders the original obsolete so what about the game on the TV?

982
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:03,880
It's it's a completely different experience playing the same game on TV and on the portable

983
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,880
I want to point this out to a yuri lover says

984
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:12,940
Objection because there are other games that are original on the Nintendo DS and sites the following Wario ware Phoenix, right?

985
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:16,020
Trauma Center Nintendogs Wario ware is not really

986
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:22,360
But you get the point it is a really original game

987
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:26,460
Japanese but okay, whatever whatever

988
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:33,640
Okay, I'll help them out then electroplankton elite beat agents. There you go. Okay. Well if you want PSP games

989
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:39,960
Um, let me try to think here luminous. I understand but look here's nothing there's enough. That's enough. Um,

990
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:41,480
Here's the thing

991
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:48,760
I've always said this the PSP is a great system if you want to do more with a handheld than just game if you want

992
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:51,080
To do the web music movies

993
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:57,160
All that crap is great on the PSP and that's really the reason to own a PSP because you want something

994
01:02:57,160 --> 01:03:02,380
That's a multimedia thing on the go and that's kind of where Sony's going lately, you know PlayStation 3

995
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:04,100
I think it's going to be a lot of that as well.

996
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:08,020
I think you're going to see in the long run from PlayStation 3, it doesn't want to be

997
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:09,580
just a game system.

998
01:03:09,580 --> 01:03:12,540
Sony's biggest problem is that Xbox 360 doesn't want to be just a game system either, but

999
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:13,540
never mind.

1000
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:14,540
That's another day.

1001
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:19,580
Nintendo, on the other hand, is starting to catch up with some of that, with the Opera

1002
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:24,060
browser coming out and everything, but for now is really just about the games.

1003
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:25,060
Games, games, games.

1004
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:31,020
And if you want some fun, short attention span, most of the time, types of games for

1005
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:36,380
casual gamer Nintendo DS is where it's at. Honestly, if you're a real hardcore gamer,

1006
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:39,500
you ought to own both, if you can afford it. If you can't afford it, get a job.

1007
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:43,740
And to be honest, I mean, what are people complaining about ports anyways? Because

1008
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:48,940
if you don't like them, don't buy them, or don't play them. And there's a lot coming out for both

1009
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:54,300
systems. Granted, when I look at it, I think most of it's crap, but then again, I only play one game

1010
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:59,900
on my PSP. So, you know, I don't really have a, you know, valid opinion on most of this stuff,

1011
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:03,580
But there is a lot of games that come out that I'm just not impressed with it

1012
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:05,360
I just like whatever ouch

1013
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:12,060
The chat room is bringing up from various folks there that the DS has had their share of misfires such as ping pals

1014
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:15,140
Oh god, wrong anyone sprung was funny

1015
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:22,540
I'm sorry was the worst no worst video ever played my life if you play as the guy the game is hilarious

1016
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:26,960
I one more email. I do one more email. Whatever. This one is from DJ Tyrant

1017
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:34,960
Hello Jamie, Rob, and Matt. Hope all is well with you. I finally have caught back up with the show now that I have moved and have cable internet at the place I'm currently living.

1018
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:40,960
Sounds like the show is doing great like always and is very informative and actually helps me out at my work. I work at EB Games, FYI.

1019
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:48,960
That's actually quite a compliment, thank you. I've actually heard of stores that have been playing our show over the system. I think that is crazy, but awesome. I love it. That's awesome.

1020
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,860
That's awesome. That's weird. It's better than Ian Kessler.

1021
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:55,340
It's gotta be better than the EB Games television or whatever that crap is.

1022
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:58,160
Ian Kessler and Courtney Freehl. They both suck and I want to beat them up.

1023
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:02,800
If you work at EB Games, get our show played in there. We will send you versions that have

1024
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:05,640
the S words and F words bleeped out if we will

1025
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:10,480
get played in store. That's pretty hot. Anyways, the point of this email was to

1026
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:14,640
encourage the OL army to get involved in the Beatmania US internet ranking.

1027
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:18,000
I think it would be a great way to show Konami interest in the game and that

1028
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,880
people did actually buy the game.

1029
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:24,040
Currently I've only seen DrewNami and myself in the internet ranking so far, sorry if I

1030
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:25,040
missed anyone.

1031
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:27,080
If you could mention this on the show, that would be great.

1032
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:31,640
Okay, so if you're a music game fan, go show your love in the Beatmania internet ranking,

1033
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:32,640
that makes sense.

1034
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:36,640
For the record, they did see that game as a success and it sold as many units, or it

1035
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:41,880
outsold as many units as they thought it would, so that sounds like a good sign, we'll see.

1036
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:46,760
Also, also I am really looking forward to the music previews for DDR Ultramix 4 and

1037
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:47,760
DDR Universe.

1038
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:50,220
Sorry about the delay there.

1039
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:54,960
When are you going to get some music previews for In the Groove 3?

1040
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,880
With a little pfft face on it.

1041
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:57,880
You know what?

1042
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:00,900
Have Rock Store give us a call, we're open.

1043
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:03,460
Keep up the great work and I can't wait to hear your next show.

1044
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:07,200
Maybe sometime in the future I will see you guys again at a con or something like that,

1045
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:10,600
as it was a disappointment to see you, only Rob I believe, for an extremely short time

1046
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,880
by the Konami booth at E3 this year.

1047
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,480
Anyway, stay healthy and well guys, I'm glad your show is doing so great.

1048
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:16,480
DJ Tyrant.

1049
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:18,820
Thank you very much for the email, it was very sweet.

1050
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:24,060
As far as other previews for other games go, we're not exclusive to, you know, we branched

1051
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:25,700
out of the music game thing a long time ago.

1052
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:29,720
We love music games, don't get us wrong, but we love all video games as well, so if any

1053
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:34,140
company wants to do some type of premiere thing, we're down, just have them give us

1054
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:35,140
a call.

1055
01:06:35,140 --> 01:06:36,140
Mailbag at orangelandrater.com.

1056
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:39,520
You can use that for your comments as well.

1057
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:40,520
Talk about your game.

1058
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:41,520
That's right.

1059
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:45,560
We would love to get you on the show, and absolutely, yes, we've given In the Groove

1060
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:48,840
somewhat of a hard time on the show in the past but you know what I'm willing

1061
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:53,040
to give it a try and I actually I don't I don't hate in the groove I think it's

1062
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:56,880
fine it's just it's an alternative some people like coke some people like Pepsi

1063
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:01,700
so it's just like coke some people like pee and some people like RC Cola for

1064
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:07,560
some god-awful reason. RC Cola is okay. Alright moving on please anyways well

1065
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:17,120
Well, Scratch won one other loss for Sony, unfortunately, in their battle against Homebrew.

1066
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:25,120
Well yes, firmware 2.8 has been hacked and now Homebrew is able, well, so far they have

1067
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:31,400
found an exploit in 2.8 and they have Homebrew running now in every single firmware that's

1068
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:38,600
available from 2.0 and up and of course you know 1.5 and whatnot.

1069
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:42,640
So that's kind of interesting and the best part about it you don't need Grand Theft Auto

1070
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:46,040
for it to work because unfortunately with some of the other ones that's how you had

1071
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,360
to do it is with Grand Theft Auto.

1072
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:53,600
But now they do have a Hello World proof of concept homebrew program that is available

1073
01:07:53,600 --> 01:08:00,160
out there and yeah it's quite interesting actually because there's also was a story

1074
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:08,400
that I read this week that they've got a downgrader now for version 2.71 to take you back down

1075
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:14,620
to 1.5, so that's quite interesting that they've already come that far.

1076
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:19,480
You watch, there'll be homebrew running before you know it on every single version, and then

1077
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:25,720
there'll be another firmware update once the webcam and the GPS comes out.

1078
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:28,920
How are you doing with the liquor?

1079
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:32,020
I think I hear you starting to slur a little bit and I'm doing the same. Oh, I'm fine

1080
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:34,020
I'm like halfway through that

1081
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:39,280
The chat room pointed out to me that you can call our mailbag is something I said earlier, I guess I don't know

1082
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:45,800
Whatever chair shut up. No, but here's the thing. Here's the thing. You don't know me. You don't know my life

1083
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:51,760
I'm just like I'm starting to get sick of the watermelon thing. You want something new? No, I do want it

1084
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:55,320
Yeah, you want some of the you want try this again? No, no, I don't want that stuff

1085
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:59,900
Especially didn't want the orange juice pussy. Yeah, I just don't like orange juice

1086
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:03,660
Unfortunately, I've got this thing stuck in my head now where orange juice equals

1087
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:07,380
Vomiting and so that it doesn't really it's not good drink

1088
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:10,260
You know what one of the first times I ever threw up I threw up

1089
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:15,740
Spaghetti O's and for some reason like I've never been able to able to really eat spaghetti O's the same way ever since then

1090
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:18,840
Well, you know what's interesting though is the first time I threw up here

1091
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:21,440
from over drinking was

1092
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:26,920
minestrone. It was homemade minestrone. But then again, that minestrone was kind of old

1093
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:32,240
and the sauce was a little bit fermented so it might have had something to do with it.

1094
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:37,200
One time I threw up, though, this was pretty funny, I threw up, I know this is great chatter

1095
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:43,340
sorry but I don't care tonight, I threw up a blue raspberry jello, which was actually

1096
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:50,600
not that bad. It's going down and coming up. It was kind of like, wow, kind of sweet. They

1097
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:56,360
they should put that on the box raspberry jello great going down pretty good coming

1098
01:09:56,360 --> 01:10:04,920
up i can see it now fuck those cream pops it's all about the

1099
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:09,020
friends you might have to do the rest of the stories tonight how's that sound okay i'm

1100
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:18,700
just gonna complain so all right uh i know how's that sui coden doing what i will kill

1101
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:19,700
I'm just kidding.

1102
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:20,700
Suikoden's not that bad.

1103
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:21,700
It's great.

1104
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:22,700
It's not that great either.

1105
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:27,700
When are they putting out Suikoden on PSP?

1106
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:28,700
Huh?

1107
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:29,700
Oh!

1108
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:30,700
Oh!

1109
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:35,420
Well, there's this movement on an official Konami site.

1110
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:38,140
It's like konamigamingstars.com.

1111
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:44,180
It's an RPG site that Konami opened for the US fans of the Konami RPGs.

1112
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:48,980
And they want the fans to show how much they want this port of 1 and 2 that came out for

1113
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:52,220
PSP in Japan to come out over here.

1114
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:58,660
So I'm sure I just made up the website URL just then with the KonamiGameStars.com.

1115
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:04,820
But if you go there and show your support, I mean, we're really trying to get it to come

1116
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:05,820
out here.

1117
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:06,820
So...

1118
01:11:06,820 --> 01:11:08,240
Show that it will set...

1119
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:11,280
Can't you talk to someone at work and make it happen?

1120
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:15,140
been talking for a long time about this game coming out over here he's like come

01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:13,400
Oh, uh, Eddie would like to point out his Konami RPG stars, by the way.

1134
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:17,120
What did I say? I don't know. I think I said something close to that. You're not even drunk! What's your excuse?

1135
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:20,800
I'm stupid. That's pretty much my excuse.

1136
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:26,240
Yeah, yeah, you are. Okay, look. Trying to get through this segment in under two hours, please.

1137
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:29,560
Uh, moving on, you know, because we don't want to get any more. Alright, alright, let's go, go.

1138
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:34,240
We don't need any angry iTunes reviews this week. This show is too fucking long.

1139
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:37,280
I don't want to download this show because it's too long.

1140
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:39,720
I like my new short, nyeh, nyeh, nyeh, nyeh.

1141
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:40,720
Well then, you know what?

1142
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:41,720
Turn on G4.

1143
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:44,280
You'll get about two minutes of game news in an entire 24-hour period, okay?

1144
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:50,720
And then Star Trek.

1145
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:55,160
This month's PlayStation Magazine has a scoop on the new PSP model.

1146
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:58,640
Apparently the unit features 8GB of flash memory built in.

1147
01:12:58,640 --> 01:12:59,840
Wow!

1148
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:03,920
On top of that, there's a video camera still being planned but no hard drive.

1149
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:10,520
Seem to recall there was something I read later in the week where Sony said no lies. It's all lies. It's not happening

1150
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:16,240
What's that the official PlayStation magazine or PSM? I think it was official PlayStation magazine. Hell's wrong these official

1151
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:22,400
Let's just make up news. Who cares? It'll give the PSP more Oh

1152
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:28,480
Attention fuck chatroom pointed out. I said something that was banned last week g4

1153
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:32,400
I'm not banned, I say whatever I want Yes, but you're not drunk, I can use that

1154
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,400
as an excuse.

1155
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:34,400
Sorry.

1156
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:35,400
Bad Rod!

1157
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,400
But I made fun of him, so it's okay.

1158
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:41,680
No, I still think it's a borderland, so let it happen again.

1159
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:43,760
By the way though, I'm sorry.

1160
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:48,800
By the way, I do gotta mention they are remaking the original Star Trek series.

1161
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:52,080
They're redoing all the CG effects in it, so you know that'll be playing on a certain

1162
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,080
channel soon.

1163
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:54,080
Anyways, uh...

1164
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,080
Yay!

1165
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:56,080
Anyways...

1166
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:57,080
A little quieter.

1167
01:13:57,080 --> 01:14:04,080
little quieter. The PlayStation 3, there's news, actually from the Inquirer, which I'm

1168
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:09,720
sure is a great source of game news, that the RSX chip in the PlayStation 3, which it

1169
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:16,720
originally was set to run at 550, 700 core memory, has been realigned with the expectations

1170
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:23,640
has been realigned with the expectations that the value will be dropped to 506.50 in other

1171
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:27,800
words being throttled down.

1172
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:30,220
And what's that supposed to mean to you?

1173
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:34,000
Probably nothing because I don't know it's not supposed to have a big effect on the games

1174
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,080
but it's kind of like the Playstation Portable because their chip can run at 333 but it only

1175
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:43,760
runs at 222 to save battery power but my guess is probably this thing is overheating.

1176
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:47,600
so that's probably why they throttled it down.

1177
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,520
Great, you know, maybe later on down the line

1178
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:50,940
they can use the full potential of the chip

1179
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:54,460
and, I don't know, with some software updates.

1180
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:57,620
So, hooray, more news.

1181
01:14:57,620 --> 01:15:00,420
The slogan for the PlayStation 3 ad campaign

1182
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:04,060
has been revealed and it's called This Is Living.

1183
01:15:04,060 --> 01:15:05,700
That is the new catchphrase you're gonna hear,

1184
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:07,100
at least in Europe, I believe,

1185
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:07,940
but I think they're gonna use that

1186
01:15:07,940 --> 01:15:08,840
in the rest of the world.

1187
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:09,680
Let's hope not.

1188
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:11,300
But if you take that last story into account,

1189
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:13,220
I think the tagline should have been This Is Burning.

1190
01:15:13,220 --> 01:15:16,300
I don't think, I think they already have a catch phrase here in the US.

1191
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:18,900
It's called, we used the Spider-Man logo.

1192
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:19,900
Play Beyond?

1193
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:21,060
Yeah, Play Beyond.

1194
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:22,060
I think.

1195
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:23,500
Well, I don't know, somewhere else they're calling it.

1196
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:25,640
This is living.

1197
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:36,740
This is living in poverty because they spent all my money on a PlayStation 3, hurrah.

1198
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:37,740
This is welfare.

1199
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:42,260
Well, anyways, what's kind of cool about the PlayStation 3 is, well, Fight Night Round 3

1200
01:15:42,260 --> 01:15:45,620
coming to it, and it will have some interesting new stuff.

1201
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:49,740
It will have a get in the ring first person mode, which will be kind of like punch out

1202
01:15:49,740 --> 01:15:50,740
I guess.

1203
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:54,820
What's also interesting though is the screenshots actually look better than the 360 version,

1204
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:59,220
but then again I haven't seen the 360 version in a while so I couldn't really say, but it

1205
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:00,220
looks better.

1206
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:02,820
I don't know, that's just me.

1207
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:07,820
But then again, you know, I thought that Motorstorm looked pretty good when I originally saw the

1208
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:11,780
screenshots and then I played it and it sucked, so I don't know.

1209
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:19,620
Loki said this is crappy this is awful this joke needs to die

1210
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:25,820
Rayman of course is coming to the Wii in the form of Rayman raving rabbits and

1211
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:30,080
somehow the rumor got started that this game was going to be Wii exclusive

1212
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:34,020
although I never heard that in my life but needless to say it was picked up

1213
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:39,780
earlier this week that Rayman is not going to be Wii exclusive now I don't

1214
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:43,060
know there's all this confusion going on at Ubisoft because you know is Assassin's

1215
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:47,540
Creed exclusive and blah blah blah supposedly it's supposed to hit more

1216
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:51,620
next-gen systems next year Assassin's Creed though is definitely

1217
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:56,220
multi-platform you know PC PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 so why the hell shouldn't

1218
01:16:56,220 --> 01:17:00,420
Rayman be multi-platform. According to Ubisoft I even asked them this no it's not

1219
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:05,060
exclusive and it will be coming out. Now the Wii version is gonna be

1220
01:17:05,060 --> 01:17:09,620
exclusive to the Wii obviously because it has a different control system that's

1221
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:10,620
That's about it.

1222
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:12,900
That's the only thing exclusive about it.

1223
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:15,940
It is one of their launch titles through the Wii that they're really looking forward to,

1224
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:20,420
but it is most definitely not exclusive and will be out on pretty much all the systems

1225
01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:23,820
from what I was reading, you know, from their lineup.

1226
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:30,500
And all about at the same time, so, sorry, not exclusive, oh well.

1227
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:36,940
Anyways, kind of on a little bit different subject here, Minnesota has decided to appeal

1228
01:17:36,940 --> 01:17:44,380
the court decision that overturned their game law calling it unconstitutional and not too

1229
01:17:44,380 --> 01:17:46,460
surprising.

1230
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:54,340
And what's interesting though, according to the Minnesota Attorney General Mike Hatch,

1231
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:58,380
his reason for appealing is what the act really does is make sure the parents are involved

1232
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:03,740
in the decisions of whether their children should play violent or sexually explicit video

1233
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:04,740
games.

1234
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:08,820
I agree with him in that statement because parents should be involved in what their kids

1235
01:18:08,820 --> 01:18:09,820
play.

1236
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:14,260
However, I don't think the law should really do much as restricting people because I think

1237
01:18:14,260 --> 01:18:15,820
it should really be up to the parents.

1238
01:18:15,820 --> 01:18:20,460
Anyways, the law simply prohibits children 16 years old and younger from buying those

1239
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:21,460
types of games.

1240
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:26,260
If the parents aren't troubled by their kids playing these games, they can buy them for

1241
01:18:26,260 --> 01:18:27,260
their children.

1242
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:32,820
But that still doesn't make any sense because what if these, say for example, little Billy

1243
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:38,020
Billy's at his school or whatever and has this maturity game in his backpack where he

1244
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:39,020
gets caught by the police.

1245
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:43,520
Now is that going to be treated the same way like say if they found cigarettes in his bag

1246
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:44,520
or something like that?

1247
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:47,980
Is possession of the video game actually part of this law?

1248
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:50,900
Or is it the sales of the video game?

1249
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:55,540
Which is stupid because then that would be almost like saying, yeah it's illegal to sell

1250
01:18:55,540 --> 01:19:00,020
alcohol to a minor but if your mom buys it for you, it's okay if you drink it.

1251
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:02,580
That's kind of the way that they're phrasing this.

1252
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:07,420
Which makes this law even more retarded, which there's no reason for the law anyways.

1253
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:09,700
Drunami in our chat room says, Enough is enough!

1254
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:14,100
I'm not sure if he's talking about what you're saying or all the incessant snakes on a plane

1255
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:16,620
jokes that are still going on in chat room.

1256
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:17,620
It's so annoying.

1257
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:20,180
You know how I watched that movie this week?

1258
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:21,180
Lame!

1259
01:19:21,180 --> 01:19:22,180
Okay.

1260
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:27,820
Yeah, Mac Man says, Here's the pop culture reference of the year.

1261
01:19:27,820 --> 01:19:30,660
Insert animal here on a insert form of transportation.

1262
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:31,660
Mad Libs!

1263
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:32,660
She's on a dog.

1264
01:19:32,660 --> 01:19:40,100
Anyway, if you want to join in the craziness that is our chat room, just head on over to

1265
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:44,860
www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on chat.

1266
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:47,940
All right, I guess that's going to do it for part A of our podcast.

1267
01:19:47,940 --> 01:19:51,140
We're going to take a little bit of a break, and we're going to come right back with more

1268
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:56,380
of Orange Lounge Radio to come in part B. Tonight, in part B of our program, Beat the

1269
01:19:56,380 --> 01:19:57,380
Host.

1270
01:19:57,380 --> 01:19:58,380
Huzzah!

1271
01:19:58,380 --> 01:20:02,340
Don't beat the host is coming back for part B. I gotta make sure I write down my

1272
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:06,980
Game if you get challenged they might go for the sober challenge to go from eglatov, right?

1273
01:20:06,980 --> 01:20:11,100
I remember the last time we played this he got a shitty score, so he'd be easy like three

1274
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:16,780
So we'll see we'll see what happens tonight all coming up in orange lounge radio part B. I could be three

1275
01:20:17,740 --> 01:20:19,740
right now

1276
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:26,140
Maybe orange lounge radio is taped live on Sunday nights and it's podcast to the world twice a week

1277
01:20:26,140 --> 01:20:31,060
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
