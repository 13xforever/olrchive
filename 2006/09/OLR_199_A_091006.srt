00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We are that independent video game podcast dedicated to video games that don't suck and video game culture and the gamer lifestyle

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm here to help you through it, my name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Joining me as always, say hello to my lovely co-host in that corner, the one and only, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Hello

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
How you doing Missy?

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm doing ok

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I love your new shirt, will you please share with the listeners what your new shirt is and where you got this

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What was that place called Chris?

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Oh God I forgot

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It was some place on hate

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Apparently it's called Oh God I Forgot, is the name of the store

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
But on the front it says, oh oh army, in the back it says DarkSakura with a zero like a team jersey and it's red and black

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I want to get one and it's going to say Rob Roberts and the number 69

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That would be awesome

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Oh also over there, Loki what's your number going to be? Techmaster Loki

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I guess 13 would be cool

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Or 666 would be good for you

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:43,000
No we don't want to have too many 6's because you know the 6 and 9 both are kind of like 6's and then I'd have 666 that would just be too weird

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That makes no sense at all but I like your shirt, you have a shirt that says Vader was framed

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah this I got as a gift from Eric and Melissa

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Alright sounds good, happy early birthday

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Matt's birthday is tomorrow September 11th, a day that is easy to remember

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I mean I never forget Matt's birthday because it's easier to remember for some reason

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yeah because if you forget we'll drive another plane into a tower

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Moving right along

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
My birthday was the Waco deal

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Wow, you know what happened on my birthday? That's when the sodomy laws got overturned in Texas and Strom Thurmond died so hey we all got something special

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Alright say hello to an OLR favorite even though she's only been here for one episode

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Say hello to Chris

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Hi

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
How you doing Chris?

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm okay, I got here kind of late and I fucked up your intro

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
That's okay see

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
By bringing you crack

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The podcast listeners don't know that because we edit the show when we fuck up

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Oh okay

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's alright

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The podcast listeners he fucked up

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We had a faulty start this evening but that's alright

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Say hello as well to a moldy favorite, Drunami

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yeah I mean you have to ask what my number is going to be

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Oh you're Drunami

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yes I'm Drunami

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Oh okay

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That's chatters meeting for the first time how cute

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yeah your number would be 23 because of your old call sign

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Alright enough of the pleasantries let's get down to business

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We like to play a little game here at Orange Lawns Radio at the start of every show

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's called How Is Your Gaming Week? Dark Sakura answer that question

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I played Tetris on Kristen's DS while having her hair done

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I've never played DS while getting my hair done but that's a good thought

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I was processing

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Do you have to put your hair on one of those giant dryers where you can't hear anything?

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
No she did

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Oh okay, oh you did?

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But it was while the diet because he touched up my roots and I have actually a black streak now on either side but you can't tell because I have my hair pulled back

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But I was sitting there playing Tetris and I couldn't see I had it right up in front of my face because I'm blind

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And so I ended up just playing that and actually I played pinball

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Did you guys get a new machine?

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
We got a new machine

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Because you called last week and you told us you had a machine

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We have Star Trek The Next Generation and Dan's apparently been working on it the whole time I've been gone

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Right on

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yeah

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Alright

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Loki anything you've been playing this week?

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I played Saints Row

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I was bored during lunch one day so I tried climbing the mountain that's on the side of the map

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Apparently there's an invisible wall so you can't do that

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But I was really high in the air so I decided to shoot rockets down at cars because that's of course the only thing you want to do if you're really high up in the air

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So I did that and that was fun

77
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And what else did I do?

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Oh I finished Blazing Angels finally have all 1000 achievement points now for it so I can sell it back

79
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That game you hate that you talk about in this segment every single week for like the past 15 weeks

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I hate it I really do hate it but you know what it's done so

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The talk of a true achievement point for

82
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Hey I have a question when it comes to achievement points

83
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Like I was looking at one of those sites that has like the leaderboards and will show you everybody's gamer score I think it was like mygamercard.net

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's a big site that has that and like the person with the most points has like 53,000 gamers points

85
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
How does anyone on earth have the time to get that many points?

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
They all have a job and they live at home and they just play games all day all night

87
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Wow that's kind of sad

88
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yeah it's ridiculous but whatever I mean if they want to spend the time to do that I'm not crazy like that

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But I do like if I'm going to sell a game back I do want to make sure I have all the points out of it

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Or in the case of like the outfit I just don't fucking care because the game is so awful that I'll just sell it back without even touching it

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I mean so whatever

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
We have another guest that's always with us every week and that is our chat room available at orangehonoredtrader.com

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Click on chat and VidPala has a comment to all this

94
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Gamer points are like the new e-peen as in e-penis

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
How was that noise?

96
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It was somebody's cell phone

97
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Please silence all cell phones before entering the studio

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I thought my laptop was like making noise I'm like that's a noise I haven't heard yet

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Alright anything else you've been playing this week?

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Grand Theft Auto of course I just played Grand Theft Auto on the PC too because I put it on my laptop

101
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
With the hot coffee mod because that's essential

102
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And then what else have I been playing? I've played some live arcade stuff

103
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I've actually been playing more like Galaga and stuff

104
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And I actually tried well Nelly's been playing a lot Bejeweled 2

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So I stole one of the games from her and I played that

106
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And then yeah that was pretty much it though

107
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I want to play more online for Saints Row but I'm waiting for the patch to come out

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Because it's supposed to be soon

109
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You know I saw you online this week on Xbox because you can see and I saw you were playing Bejeweled 2 and I was like loser

110
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
That's because it's Nelly she keeps playing Bejeweled 2

111
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And then I went to Majornelson.com and he has the list of the top Xbox games and now he's doing the arcade games too

112
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And Bejeweled 2 is like number 11, 13, somewhere around there and I'm like losers

113
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So yeah

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Bejeweled was cool like five years ago

115
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's the game she likes, the only game, she was playing Chloe and Clyde though earlier this week too

116
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Which is impressive because that's like the game that you cannot get those gamer points ever

117
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's damn impossible

118
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Bejeweled 2 has the hardest gamer points of any Xbox game I've played, period

119
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I don't get it, I was looking at the leaderboards, there was someone that like did 250 levels of the main game

120
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm like how do you even do that? That's one hell of a lucky game because

121
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So yeah whatever

122
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Alrighty, let's go over to Drewnami, Drewnami how was your gaming week?

123
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I played Bejeweled

124
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
For real?

125
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
For real

126
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Are you a loser? No I'm kidding, I don't wanna

127
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Look people play casual games and that's okay, it's just you know

128
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I was bored

129
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
If you own an Xbox 360 and the only thing you're playing on it is Bejeweled

130
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You are a loser

131
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Something's wrong, something's wrong

132
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Aside from that I was kicking it semi old school, I was playing Space Channel 5 and Disgaea

133
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And the usual WoW

134
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Are you gonna be in the new Disgaea?

135
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
When I have the money

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yeah

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I mean it's already out but I wanna finish the original Disgaea first

138
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I hear, I haven't played the new Disgaea, I've just heard that it's almost just like the first one

139
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Like you know it just kind of seamlessly picks up and moves on

140
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Why change a good thing?

141
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And there's still printies in it and apparently

142
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Goodie

143
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
There is a cameo of Etna in it

144
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Cool

145
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So

146
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Looks to be good

147
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So anything else besides the WoW and the Bejeweled?

148
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Like I said Space Channel 5

149
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Oh hot, I love Space Channel 5

150
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Reminds me how much my short term memory sucks

151
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm sorry what were you talking about?

152
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Your gaming week? Alright anyway

153
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
My gaming week, cause I forgot I haven't talked about mine yet

154
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I haven't played anything new, there really wasn't a lot new this week I wanted to buy

155
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So it's really most of the same stuff I don't have any new reviews for you guys this week

156
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Just because you know people don't really send us stuff

157
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And actually can we talk about the one game that we got sent the promo

158
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Oh yeah okay we can talk about Rule of Rose now

159
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So cause we got sent a review for Rule of Rose a while back and I think we can talk about that now

160
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So I played Rule of Rose a few weeks ago and it's being promoted as this Silent Hill-esque kind of game

161
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And for the most part that would be an accurate way to describe it

162
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
If you're into the Silent Hill games you'll probably like Rule of Rose

163
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's like historically based a little bit

164
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So it kind of takes place in the 20's and I think it's supposed to be like actually based on this old story

165
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Are there giant crabs?

166
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
There are no giant enemy crabs

167
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
There are screwed up children that mess with your mind

168
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
In fact this game is somewhat controversial right?

169
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Cause there's subtle, very very subtle pedophilia themes in it

170
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
But not anything crazy

171
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Very subtle

172
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Don't take that to mean that it's like in your face

173
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I didn't get to finish the game cause I had to loan my sister my Playstation 2 to use as a DVD player

174
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Anyway so she's borrowing that right now

175
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So I didn't get to finish it but I did play about three quarters away through the game

176
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And yeah from what I understand it is based loosely on

177
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I don't want to really

178
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I guess the story that it's kind of based on is actually a real event about some zeppelin that crashed into an orphanage

179
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Killed lots of people

180
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So that gives you an idea of how it might be sort of like a Silent Hill type of game

181
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Cause the whole game seems to take place pretty much on this blimp that you're on

182
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And it's really creepy and strange

183
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's just unlike Silent Hill it's less

184
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
But to be fair the blimp is expansive

185
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Just like Castlevania always takes place in the castle

186
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
But it's expansive you know what I mean?

187
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Exactly it's huge so

188
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's an extra dimensional blimp

189
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And you know what I thought of actually

190
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You know how that Castlevania game on DS I said was one of the first games to take the game outside the castle

191
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That's not true

192
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Castlevania II Simon's Quest

193
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I completely forgot about it

194
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
How dare I?

195
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I lose five gamer points

196
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
To be technical you could also go outside the castle in Symphony of the Night

197
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Not enough though you know what I mean?

198
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Technically you were outside of the castle

199
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You were above it as a bat

200
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You could also say the very very first stage in Castlevania you're walking up to the castle

201
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You could also say that Super Castlevania had the same thing too

202
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
What the fuck I didn't mean

203
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
In Castlevania III actually there's a lot of parts that weren't in the castle

204
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And in Dracula X

205
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Look shut your mouth

206
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
We're supposed to be talking about

207
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Okay okay let's just play this way

208
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:23,000
The first Metroidvania where you can legitimately go outside the castle for an extended period of time

209
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I like that Metroidvania

210
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Weren't we talking about Rule of Rose?

211
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
How did this turn into bashrobsgamercred here somehow?

212
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's always bashrobsgamercred

213
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Oh no only on message boards sorry

214
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It was a pretty fun game I liked it

215
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's very strange and I think it's one of those games that you're not going to understand what's going on until the very end

216
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
What did you think of having the dog element?

217
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Because that's where it really differs from Silent Hills

218
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You have this partner about 30 minutes to an hour into the game

219
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You get this partner that helps you

220
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
This dog that will seek out items

221
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And kind of adds a real interesting element to the puzzle

222
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It is an interesting element and to be honest I didn't realize how important it was

223
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You can actually find a lot of hidden weapons and items that way by searching out different things

224
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And you can get some really super powerful weapons if you actually spend the time to use the dog to find different items

225
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
That seem useless but you trade them in for better stuff

226
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:22,000
So the dog is pretty cool and it also kind of simplifies things because it makes it simple to find where you're supposed to go

227
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You just have the dog sniff out stuff

228
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:32,000
But the creatures in it are very creepy though all these kind of golem or imp kind of characters

229
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:39,000
There's children that have like no faces basically and they're just kind of I don't know how to describe them really

230
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Just creepy looking

231
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So with the dog element we're talking like Silent Hill meets Secret of Evermore?

232
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
No it's more like Silent Hill meets...

233
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Oh what was it?

234
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Haunting Ground

235
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You know the way I'll test if a game is scary or not is I'll make Christopher's sister play it, my roommate

236
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I'll make his sister play it because like seriously this is the girl, and she's not here right now so I can talk a little shit

237
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
This is the girl who cried while fighting a Silent Hill 3 boss because she couldn't take it

238
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Because the boss would run around her and then try to slash her so she started crying

239
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Which one was it?

240
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I don't remember the name

241
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Was it Silent Hill 2?

242
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
No on 3, you find it on the rooftop

243
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Oh yeah

244
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Oh I got that

245
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Like she cried a lot

246
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
So if I want to test if a game is scary or not I'll make her play it

247
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So I made her play Rule of Rose and she did, she freaked out, she threw the controller on the ground in a few parts

248
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
She's like I'm not gonna play, I'm not gonna play

249
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And then she picks it up again

250
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So the scare factor is definitely there if you're a big girl

251
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
No no no no I got that beat

252
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
We were playing Fatal Frame, one of my friends and I, we were playing Fatal Frame

253
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I could not even get her to walk the few feet in the fog because I was freaking out and nothing was happening and I was freaking out

254
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I got that beat

255
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You know Fatal Frame is the one scary series I could not get into for some reason

256
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I don't know why

257
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It freaked me out, I don't know why

258
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
How many of us that are playing the first Resident Evil freaked out when the dogs crashed through the window?

259
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I freaked out at the horrible voiceovers

260
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I hope that is not Chris's blood

261
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Actually my first Resident Evil was 2 for some reason, I kind of missed the boat a little bit

262
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
But anyway, sorry, Rule of Rose, final thoughts on Rule of Rose

263
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I really like it, it is probably one of the games I've actually played a lot of recently

264
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:29,000
At least almost all the way through and definitely one that I haven't really played that many games on the Playstation 2 lately

265
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
So I recommend picking it up, the only thing that sucks about it is it is full price, it's like $49.99

266
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:42,000
But if you're really into those kind of niche horror games, it's going to be pretty good for you

267
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
If you like adventure horror type games, Rule of Rose is going to be right up your alley

268
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's got a great soundtrack too, I forgot to say the soundtrack is phenomenal

269
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
The soundtrack is awesome, it's actually done by the people who did Panzer Dragoon

270
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's a phenomenal soundtrack, I'm very impressed

271
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And what's even cool about the whole thing is once you're done with the game

272
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
If you do look up, if you read on message boards and stuff about the backstory to it

273
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's going to be even creepier just the whole thing because it's based on real life

274
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Sort of, it's based on real events, how about that

275
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
The gameplay itself I wouldn't call super original

276
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And it's a weird entry for sort of what's starting to, you know, we're wrapping down this generation of games

277
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
But overall I would recommend it to fans of the genre

278
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And the animation in it is really good too

279
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I would recommend it to fans of the genre, I think you guys will be pleased

280
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Alright, shall we get into some gaming news tonight then?

281
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Oh first, quick housekeeping before we get into gaming news

282
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I just wanted to say if you missed the announcement on our website

283
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
We have relaunched the Dance Dance Revolution sneak peeks

284
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And they start tonight and the good news is

285
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Even though it was delayed a week, good things come to those who wait

286
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It will be a part of the podcast, you don't have to just listen live to hear the songs

287
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So this is amazing, we're really excited to be working with Konami of Hawaii

288
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
To play some new songs for you, we'll get to that shortly after some news

289
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You know what else is amazing?

290
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
What?

291
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Well actually what's not amazing?

292
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
In Karage

293
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Why?

294
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What did he do now?

295
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
In the news today, he got a new bicycle helmet

296
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Because he chewed through his strap on his last one

297
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And ended up throwing up crayons all over the place

298
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Wow, and did he eat paste?

299
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm sorry, we didn't do Chris's gaming week, I'm so sorry

300
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Honey, how was your gaming week?

301
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Oh it was okay, the only reason I wanted

302
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I don't know how many Mac fans you guys have on there, probably not a lot

303
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Actually, you'd be surprised how much hate mail Logan gets

304
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Okay, I have a Mac PowerBook Pro or whatever it's called

305
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The latest, whatever the most expensive thing is

306
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Macbook Pro, whatever the most expensive thing is

307
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And for those of you who like the Sims 2 games on the Mac

308
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Go out and get open for business

309
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Because in the last few games of the Sims 2

310
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It slows, like the computer just lags it to death

311
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Like anything, any animation, any huge thing that the game does

312
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's lagged and stuff like that

313
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And out to lunch, they completely take care of that

314
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It's lightning fast

315
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Like I got all the animation, I got all the little fun nifty things that happen

316
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
When your character does something

317
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
So I just got that and I just played it

318
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
So that was my fun gaming week

319
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
That and I played The Da Vinci Code, which sucks

320
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Why does it suck?

321
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm not bright

322
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Is it just your typical bad movie tie-in game?

323
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Pretty much

324
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
They want you to do every little knick-knack thing

325
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I thought it was going to be cool

326
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Because it's like, oh, I like stories

327
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And they make you do every little thing

328
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And I'm not bright

329
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
So there's really no point to me playing that

330
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
So you're going to pick up Sims 2 pets when that comes out?

331
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Hell yeah, I want to kill a dog

332
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Alright

333
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
That's an excellent reason

334
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I like killing puppies

335
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Please, no hate mail for the pet lovers

336
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
No, no, no, no

337
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
If you kill the pets

338
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Oh, it's a rumor actually

339
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
If you kill the pets, they get a little tombstone

340
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And they walk around as ghosts

341
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's hilarious

342
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Every time I hear about dead pets now, I can't help but think about

343
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Madonna!

344
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
My precious Madonna!

345
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Oh my god

346
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I cheered when that lady got chewed on

347
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yeah, it's rumored that they did it again

348
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And they have the dogs chase the cats

349
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's pretty funny

350
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Before the hate mail from PETA comes in

351
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Sorry, so sorry

352
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It's because you're not standing on a chair

353
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
So you're down here on the ground

354
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
People eating tasty animals

355
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I want to hear about people eating tasty paint chips

356
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Back to a Sony

357
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Ken Kuragi is licking wallpaper

358
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,000
But actually, this is proof that he has his head way up his ass

359
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Sony has made an official statement saying that they are

360
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
To quote

361
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,000
The delay in mass production schedule of the blue laser diode within the Sony group

362
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Thus affecting the timely procurement of key components to be utilized in PlayStation 3

363
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
So, in Europe, Russia, Middle East, Africa, and Australia

364
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
We'll have to wait until March to get a PS3

365
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
However, it is on track to launch in Japan on November 11th

366
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
And in North America on November 17th

367
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
So basically, by the time you all get it overseas, we're going to tell you how much it sucks already

368
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
So essentially, Sony just gave Europe the finger this week, essentially

369
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Not just Europe, you know

370
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
That whole chunk of the world

371
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Sorry, but yeah, everything on that side of the ocean pretty much got the shaft

372
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Their plan, though, is to still ship 6 million PS3s globally by the end of the 2007 fiscal year

373
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Is this a surprise, though, that this has been delayed? I think a lot of us saw this coming

374
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
The rumors were out before, you know

375
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Actually, before they made the announcement that there was a shortage with their shipment

376
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Hmm, that's kind of funny, you know, because when you don't, I don't know, start production on a console yet

377
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Yeah, it's probably going to be delayed, but

378
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And it's also, you know, not a surprise since the announcement of the delay that they're going to be limited on the quantities

379
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
That they're going to have for the other two territories that they're actually launching on time

380
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
And that would be both Japan and North America

381
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
What's interesting, though, is that the US is getting 400,000 units at launch

382
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And Japan's only getting 100,000

383
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Now, I don't know about you guys, but I figured that Sony, figured that Japan, you know, is pretty rabid Sony fans

384
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
And I figured they would give them more units than just 100,000, but I don't know

385
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Is that because of the population difference or something?

386
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I think what it is, I think what it is, maybe, population difference

387
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Also the fact that they have probably a better, they want to have more ground on the US front instead of Japan

388
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Because right now, Japan, the 360 isn't doing very well, so

389
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Interesting, but, yeah

390
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Is Sony screwed because of this? I mean, seriously guys, I was thinking this week

391
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,000
You know, I'm like, you know, I didn't buy a Playstation 2 until like it was already out for a year

392
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You know, and the Playstation 1 I didn't even blink an eye at until they started getting some of the games I was really interested in on it

393
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
So, could the Playstation 3 simply repeat that or maybe we're all giving it a hard time

394
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Because we're all focused on the launch right now

395
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
But in a year, could the Playstation 3 maybe be a good console?

396
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
To be honest, I mean, what, the 360 launched with almost the same amount of units

397
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,000
So, I don't see that being as big of a deal as the fact that it's $600

398
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:43,000
And, you know, right now, like they released their first commercial or kind of mini movies that they're going to be advertising it in the UK with

399
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:54,000
And their big advertisement is, yeah, the AI in games, guess what, it's not just, you know, it's better to spend $600 to buy our games

400
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
That's pretty much, you know, their first little thing, it's adaptive, it learns

401
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Oh goody, learning AI, you know, because no other games out there have that

402
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Or something

403
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Interesting comments from chatroom here, Solarwing is in our chat and says

404
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Of the 400,000, how many will work?

405
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I mean, consoles are notorious at launch time for not working

406
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Go back in the archives, when I got my Xbox 360 in like February

407
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I got a freaking 3 rings of death after 24 hours and I was pissed

408
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I think I went off on one show

409
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Here's the other thing that you got to think about too that's really interesting

410
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
They allocated all their diodes that were being made to the Playstation 3

411
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Because they were putting all their eggs in one basket

412
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:41,000
So their standalone Blu-ray player is probably going to be delayed because there's no diodes for it obviously

413
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Since they can't even make enough for the Playstation 3

414
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
What's that going to do for Blu-ray?

415
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
That's the big thing, because if they get enough of those HD DVD players out there

416
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Then, you know, that might be a problem

417
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
But then again, I don't know, I think they use even the same diodes on the HD DVD players

418
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Who knows

419
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Comment from Jeremy Todd 1 in chat, with such an extreme shortage I wonder how high prices for the PS3 will get on eBay

420
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And here's the other thing too

421
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Remember back in spring when it was supposedly that Playstation 3 was going to launch

422
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
And, you know, oh yeah we're on track, we're on track

423
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Do we really trust that they're really on track seeing as they haven't even started building these things yet

424
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if we get to November and oh, guess what, we're delayed until 2007

425
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
So, well let's just, it's kind of a wait and see

426
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Don't you think, maybe that wouldn't be such a bad thing for them at this point

427
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I mean honestly, should Sony delay the console worldwide until 2007

428
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I asked this to everybody on the panel

429
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Yes or no and why

430
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
No, because they're going to miss out on their Christmas and I think that'd be death for them

431
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
They need to have their console out there even if it's going to be limited in numbers

432
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Because if anything it'll sell out, people will want it because it's sold out

433
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And there you go

434
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Dark Sakura

435
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
That's pretty much my assessment on the same thing

436
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I mean, people want what they can't have basically

437
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Okay

438
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Drunami

439
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Ditto, the shortage is just going to create more demand

440
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
So, you know, why mess up a good marketing strategy

441
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Even though the commercials are much akin to polishing a turd

442
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Okay, Chris, should Sony delay, yes or no

443
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
No, they at least need to get the Christmas stuff out there

444
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I mean, that whole market and stuff like that, so pretty much what everyone else said

445
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Okay, I'm going to be brave, I'm going to say yes

446
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I think Sony ought to delay at this point

447
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Because the games, the lineup games could get stronger for launch

448
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Because you've seen all these games getting shuffled around the launch window

449
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
They would still get the console out by the end of their fiscal year

450
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
And they could have a stronger launch

451
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I think people are going to buy these systems Christmas or not

452
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I think the same people are going to buy the system no matter what time of year you launch

453
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I realize there's this huge thing to want to get the spoiled kids around Christmas

454
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
But those spoiled kids will find an excuse to get their systems in April or March if they want to release them

455
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Oh, hold on a sec

456
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:05,000
What I think is, why would developers be so brave as to dev new games after the launch titles

457
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
If the system hasn't been sold yet and the launch titles haven't caught on

458
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
And so the PS3 hasn't caught on

459
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Who's going to be brave enough to dev games for that?

460
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Alright

461
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Interesting thoughts from Chad as well

462
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Jeremy Tom 1 says, the huge problem with this though is that a few people will get a PS3

463
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
And then their friends will see it and they might decide that the graphics aren't much different from the 360

464
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
And they'll go buy a 360 instead

465
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
You know, it's kind of weird

466
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
And I'm having this weird thing going on

467
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
The more I haven't been actually seeing some of these games again

468
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
You know, like Resistance and Lair and stuff like that

469
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I'm actually starting to think, hey you know what, these are actually kind of looking better than the 360

470
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,000
But then again, it makes the games look interesting but I want to see how they play

471
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I don't give a crap if the graphics are slightly higher resolution than this

472
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
That does not make the console any better than its predecessor

473
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Or its competition for that matter

474
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
It's just why some DS games are simpler looking but they're more fun to play

475
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I don't know, they're really trying to say better graphics equal better games and that's just not the case

476
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
The system is only as good as the games that are on it

477
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
True, and Psycoon has an interesting follow up to that

478
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Psycoon says, I will get a PS3 on the day Kingdom Hearts 3 comes out

479
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
So is it just going to take, and even Chris agrees with that comment

480
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Is it just going to take that game to sell the system?

481
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:40,000
You know what, I'm sorry, I don't have a lot of money to drop on a game system

482
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
If there's not going to be a game that I want

483
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I'm a very big Disney fan so I bought a PS2 for the sole purpose of playing Kingdom Hearts

484
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And I've discovered other games that I like about it

485
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
But unless they make a game that I want, I'm not going to drop that much money on it

486
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
The Wii does look interesting though

487
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Megzy's in chat and says there's no reason to get a PS3 at launch

488
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
The only exclusive games worth getting will be out in 2007-2008

489
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Metal Gear Solid 4, Final Fantasy 13 and so on

490
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
That's kind of how I felt about the Playstation 2

491
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
To be honest, what was I going to buy at launch, Fantavision?

492
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
There is some good games, there are some

493
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Fantavision was sort of fun

494
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Was it Lair, is it Miklotov or Jamie in here? I'm not sure

495
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
It was sort of fun

496
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I would say there are some good exclusive games, Lair and Resistance Fall of Man look pretty good

497
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
But then again, I haven't seen them

498
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I think after Tokyo Game Show we'll get a better gauge of how good the games are going to be

499
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And they're going to have to start marketing this thing pretty soon

500
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Because convincing someone why they need to buy a $600 console is going to be pretty difficult

501
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
So, we'll have to wait and see

502
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Alright, well moving on, one thing that will be available around the PS3 launch

503
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
If you can't afford a Playstation 3, which most of us can't

504
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
And by the way, you know what Europe, I'll do you a favor

505
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I am not going to buy a Playstation 3 until you guys are able to buy a Playstation 3

506
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Which is easy because I wasn't going to get one anyway

507
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
But we can call this a protest now, it makes it really easy

508
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Honestly Europe, I don't think you guys are missing much

509
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I mean that's kind of how I feel, I don't want one of these at launch

510
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I guess maybe I feel bad for the person who really really does in Europe that can't have one now

511
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Well, you know what, couldn't they just import?

512
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Because the games are supposed to be region free

513
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
We haven't really had super final confirmation on that though, that could have changed

514
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:50,000
However, unless Sony is just going to say give a big F you to format

515
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Because you still have the difference between NTSC and PAL

516
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Oh, that's a good point

517
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Unless they are just going to say screw all you, it's high definition or NTSC only

518
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:08,000
But I don't think that's right, that would really put aside a large market of business

519
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I meant to say that something that will be available when the Playstation 3 launches in November

520
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Is the PSP download service

521
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Original Playstation games will be downloadable and the PSP has no problem running them via an emulator

522
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
This is all coming from Sony's head of platform development in Japan, Izumi Kawanishi

523
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Kawanishi is also saying that the PSP download service will have movies as well as full original Playstation games

524
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
And it will launch at the same time as the Playstation 3

525
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
And that's about it, that's all they said

526
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Well, you can't download retail movies yet, you can get like vodcasts and things using little hacks

527
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
But Sony has yet to really support full blown movies

528
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
And obviously they are going to be releasing the digital rights management and all this stuff

529
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And I guess trying to salvage some of what they have lost on UMD, I don't know

530
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Well, I think they were rumored to be trying to relaunch UMD at a lower price point or something like that

531
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I remember seeing an article on some site that talked about how they really, really sliced the cost of UMDs in Japan

532
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,000
To about 8 bucks a disk, our price, and they are on fire, they are selling like crazy

533
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,000
So that's the secret Sony, just put out the UMDs and sell them a little cheaper than what you are doing

534
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Make them cheaper than DVDs, and I think they will be a lot more appealing to a lot of people very quick

535
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And you will sell PSPs, but what do I know, I'm just some schmo on the internet

536
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Exactly, well I didn't want to say exactly

537
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:44,000
But anyways, some other things that are possibly in the works right now would be a Sony Playstation phone

538
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:54,000
And I kind of, when I saw this I was thinking, oh god, please not another N-Gage, because that's just horrible

539
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:04,000
But apparently, according to Sony Ericsson's Senior Vice President of Product and Application Planning, Rico Sakaguchi

540
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
The company is working on something related to the Playstation phone

541
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And it says the surprise must be kept for the future, so maybe something that will be announced at the Tokyo Game Show

542
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I don't know, it sounds interesting, I'm not sure, maybe something to do with the download service

543
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
And they are going to do something with the phones, you can download Playstation 1 games or something

544
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Voice over IP

545
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
That would be a huge perk, I think, to voice over IP

546
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
The phone station

547
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I think what I like about the PSP a lot is that it really is kind of this all in one system

548
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,000
It kind of is the leg up that it has on the DS, it seems like the DS, well it has a lot of solid games that are innovative

549
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:54,000
It's kind of having to catch up in the department of having a web browser, playing MP3s and all this other stuff that a PSP does

550
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
You know what I mean?

551
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:02,000
But wouldn't you rather have a system that you know is going to play a good game, that you know they put effort into

552
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Well, what if I'm more of the casual gamer, who maybe that's not my biggest focus on the system

553
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
DS sales are still kicking PSP

554
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Yeah, but don't get me wrong, it's interesting all these things that kind of distinguish the PSP a little bit

555
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I think they're all cool, but the market is showing people aren't interested in all that as much as they are in just having good games

556
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Okay

557
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Well, speaking of good games, there is something coming on to PSP that I will definitely be all over

558
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Parappa the Rapper is coming on to PSP

559
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
In the rain or in the snow?

560
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Got the funky, funky flow

561
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Crack butter!

562
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
No, don't even get me started on too many levels

563
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Check and turn and signal to the left, sorry, love Parappa, love it

564
00:32:53,000 --> 00:33:02,000
There's not really an official announcement yet, but the game was recently featured in Famitsu

565
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
So the talk is that we are pretty much going to be getting a Parappa

566
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
And actually that makes sense because they did Guitar Man

567
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:17,000
And they're starting to put out a bit more music and slash quirky games on the PSP

568
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
So my hope is that this does come to pass

569
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And so this isn't just a port of the PS1 thing on the download service, this is like a whole new frickin' thing

570
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
That's the rumor

571
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Wow, that would be hot, because Parappa kind of disappeared for a while

572
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Granted, Parappa the Rapper 2 wasn't quite as good as one, at least commercially

573
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
We need to own Jameralami

574
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Yeah, I know, we need to bring the series back, that would be awesome

575
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Well, Parappa is not the only thing rumored to be coming back for the PSP

576
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Electronic Arts has confirmed that they are doing an EA Replay collection

577
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And this will be a budget series of adventures for those folks that would be interested in this

578
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Get this, the types of games that are going to be in the EA Replay

579
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Syndicate, Ultima 7 The Black Gate, Road Rash 1-3, Wing Commander

580
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:07,000
And some other interesting titles such as Desert Strike, Jungle Strike, Virtual Pinball, Mutant League Football

581
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
That would be very interesting

582
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
But they haven't said anything about that they're going to upgrade the graphics

583
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
These may just be straight up ports, but still there's something oddly appealing about being able to play Wing Commander

584
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I think they were supposed to be ports of the Super Nintendo and Genesis versions

585
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Oh, that would be a crap, if it's just a port of the Genesis, oh forget it

586
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
It's all about the PC one, but Ultima 7 wasn't on PC

587
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I mean, whoops, Ultima 7 was only on PC, wasn't it?

588
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
They ported 6 to Super Nintendo, they didn't do 7

589
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Yeah, they ported 6, they didn't port 7

590
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Yeah, they didn't port 7, so there must be some PC things involved

591
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Who knows?

592
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Anyways, it's kind of interesting though that at least that is coming out

593
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
One game that is not coming out on time, Armored Core 4

594
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,000
It's missing the Playstation 3 launch and it's rumored to have been canceled for the 360

595
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Which is very disappointing because I love me my Armored Core a bit more than ChromeHounds, that's for sure

596
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
But anyways, yeah, the From Software game

597
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
You know, I just have a really hard time believing that it's canceled on 360

598
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Seeing as, you know, they've already kind of worked on, you know, ChromeHounds

599
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
But anyways, it's supposed to be coming out in spring of next year

600
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:28,000
So, you know, yet another reason why waiting to march maybe isn't such a bad idea for the Playstation 3

601
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Well, in regards to other games and the Playstation 3

602
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Enchanted Arms is actually going to be out on the Playstation 3

603
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I don't know how I feel about that, I mean, I picked up Enchanted Arms, I haven't played it yet

604
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I think you're going to enjoy it, I think you'll enjoy it

605
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,000
You know, it took me a while to get into the game, but it's really good

606
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I mean, it's not the best RPG I've ever played, but it's a very good first next-gen experience for RPGs

607
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I was just thinking it was good to have such a solid, you know, apparently a solid game

608
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,000
On the 360 and just that it's coming out on the Playstation 3, just sort of like, no

609
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
It seems like it's a little late, you know, by the time it comes out for the Playstation 3

610
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
It'll be like, oh well, next-gen RPGs are going to be old news

611
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I guess it depends when it comes out, I mean, if Enchanted Arms is coming out at launch

612
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Well, that might not be a bad thing, that could be pretty good for Sony

613
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
But it doesn't seem like it would be out in time for launch if it's just now being announced

614
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I don't know

615
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Nah, probably not

616
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I mean, they already have Oblivion coming out, so that's pretty good

617
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
That's true, maybe if they could redo all the voiceovers then it wouldn't be so bad

618
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I don't think they would

619
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I don't think they would

620
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
It would be just a port

621
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I don't think they would either

622
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Well, one other thing you're going to be missing out on on the Playstation 3

623
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Rumors now is that 1080p is actually not really going to be used in games as much as you think

624
00:36:51,000 --> 00:37:00,000
According to Sony, the official US Playstation 3 site says that the HDMI connection is required for 1080p signals in Blu-ray movies

625
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Sony has made an issue of pointing out that 1080p, which the Xbox 360 is incapable of, is the holy grail of full HD

626
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
The only game that's running in 1080p, though, is Gran Turismo HD

627
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
This was just a tech demo that was created, not really a full game that's running yet

628
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Well, actually, it is going to be a full game, unfortunately

629
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Well, but it should be said also that even with final hardware in mind, reaching a good frame rate at 1080p with next-gen graphics is almost impossible

630
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Most folks are just aiming for 720p

631
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:38,000
So it sounds like, okay, your movies will be at 1080p, which will be nice, but your games, not a lot are going to be at 1080p

632
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Now, to Sony's benefit, or to Sony's credit, though, here

633
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Maybe this is something that would be more at the Playstation 3's end of cycle, that you'd start seeing more 1080p games

634
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Like how on Xbox, the first Xbox, before the 360

635
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
You started seeing, in the end, some games start to come out in high def towards the end

636
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
And then widescreen, especially, you started seeing a lot more widescreen games on Xbox

637
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
And then you started to see, like, burnout, wasn't one of the burnouts towards the end in 720p?

638
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Yeah, I think so

639
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
So maybe 1080p is just something that will be more utilized later down the road

640
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:18,000
But wait, are you guys seeing that Sony was lying when they said that they can do 1080p at 120 frames per second?

641
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Well, in one game

642
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Fucking retarded, I don't know why we trust them with any comments anymore

643
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
But, whatever, so, okay, so your games are not going to be 1080p

644
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
You know, 1080i is pretty good anyways

645
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Although, one thing that's kind of being debated right now is load times

646
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,000
And as anyone remembers on the Playstation stuff, the load times can be quite long

647
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
And they're actually saying that because of the blu-ray drive being a first generation drive

648
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:56,000
It is going to be slower than the actual DVD drive in the Xbox 360

649
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Now, the blu-ray drive is actually going to be a 1.5 speed drive

650
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
And transfers at about 54 megabits a second

651
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:14,000
And they said that their Playstation 3 is actually a 2-speed blu-ray drive

652
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Which is actually 72 megabits per second or 9 megabytes per second

653
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Now, the 360 is a 12-speed DVD drive which gives you 16 megabytes per second

654
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
So that is a bit faster

655
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Now, the thing that, when I was reading this, is since all the Playstation 3s are going to have a hard drive in them though

656
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
The developers are going to be able to develop, you know, with a hard drive in mind

657
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
So you're going to be able to cache a lot of stuff to your hard drive, I would think

658
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Because whereas, you know, the one big thing with the 360, I remember, because of the core and premium bundles

659
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Is they weren't sure if the hard drive was going to be there

660
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,000
And so they couldn't really, you know, take that into account and cache the information to it

661
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
But I guess now more of the games are using the hard drive

662
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
But that might be something that might speed it up

663
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
And, whatever, it's load times

664
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
If you want your 1080p games at 120 frames per second, you're going to have to wait

665
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Well, yeah, I think you said it with load times

666
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I mean, I don't care what the speed is of the thing inside the system

667
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000
It's all about, you know, the load time and how good the system is at, you know, caching and all that stuff

668
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Though, you know, I get it, logic dictates that you have a slow drive in the thing, you're going to have longer load times

669
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I get it, but if there's some other way Sony can get around that and the developers

670
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Then I don't think it will be the end of the world

671
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Yeah, exactly

672
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Alright, well let's go over to a realm that we don't get into often enough here on this program, that's PC gaming

673
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
And we have a few PC gaming stories for you guys tonight

674
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
And I want to start off with something on Second Life

675
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Which is this thing I keep hearing about, but honestly I've never really had a chance to get into and play

676
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Drew Nami, you play Second Life, tell me a little bit about what Second Life is all about

677
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
It's kind of like a virtual community, if you've ever played

678
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Actually, it is a virtual community

679
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,000
If you've ever played like, say, Sims Online or There or anything like that

680
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
It's this virtual world, you have your avatar, you can customize the avatar

681
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
It's got a lot of communities in there, it's fairly technical if you want to code your own stuff

682
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Okay, I get that, it's a virtual world, why should I get into Second Life?

683
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Basically anything you can't do in real life, you can do in Second Life

684
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,000
You can build stuff all on your own, have your own zone's own virtual land in there

685
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I can be a stripper

686
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Have sex in different rooms

687
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I can't, as Chris said, wait you gotta say that Chris

688
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Have sex in weird positions

689
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Yeah, things that may not be physically possible in real life

690
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Number one, it is possible, number two, unfortunately I've seen it done

691
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Or in the case of this picture I'm looking at here, I'm not sure if this is from Second Life or what

692
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
But it looks like you have furries banding together there in Second Life

693
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
There's actually a pretty active furry community within Second Life

694
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Okay, whatever you're into, don't touch me with your paws

695
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:09,000
But anyway, the reason why I bring this up, I got in the news this week that hackers broke into Second Life on Thursday

696
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
And it was noted on the blog of the parent company to Second Life, Linden Labs

697
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:23,000
The intruders got access to the account names, real life names, contact information, encrypted account passwords and encrypted payment information

698
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Now, these types of violations of security sadly aren't that uncommon when you think about it happens in the Amazon type market

699
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I'm not saying that site specifically, but those type of markets online all the time

700
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:44,000
But this is really the first, or at least one of the most notable cases where it's happening in a video game

701
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Or it's happening in a place where people spend a lot of time as opposed to check in, check out

702
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:59,000
So the possibility that folks are going to feel more violated over it is I think a lot higher in my opinion

703
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I mean we still get pissed off in MMOs over gold sellers

704
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:09,000
True, so what do you think about this? Being a Second Life player, what do you think about the fact that your information may have been compromised?

705
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Well, for me personally, I don't put anything up on there that I wouldn't be embarrassed to have public

706
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:22,000
But the net result what pissed me off is I had to reset my damn password, they invalidated everyone's passwords

707
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Oh interesting, well at least they were pretty quick to get in there and try to fix things, that's good

708
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Yeah, I think they got it done in like a matter of hours

709
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Alright, well, pretty quick on Linden Labs

710
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Good for them for being right on it and you know, remedying the situation

711
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Well, guess what is not being remedied

712
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
What's that?

713
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Well not really, but you know, you remember how everyone was all like, yeah Spore's gonna be all over the place, right?

714
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Right, like DS and PSP and all that stuff?

715
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
No

716
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
No? Like no console versions at all?

717
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
It's PC only for now

718
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Oh, okay

719
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Basically, and this is the quote from EA

720
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Although we're investigating the possibilities of bringing this franchise to other platforms in the future

721
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Any announcements or confirmations for the Wii or any other platform would be premature

722
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Oh, this might be because I think I remember reading another story earlier this week about how

723
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I think they were saying something about Spore on the Wii was gonna be able to download to the DS

724
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
And you could edit your creatures on the go

725
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Well, they're saying right now they're 100% focused on finishing Spore for PC and PC only

726
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Okay

727
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
As that's the official word

728
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
That makes sense, but we all know it's gonna go like The Sims

729
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Where The Sims was on PC first and then you had 5 gazillion different versions on all the consoles just later on

730
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
It'll spread

731
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Yeah

732
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
But for now, I think it's actually good that they are focusing only on PC

733
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:53,000
That way they can bring out a quality product to get the buzz going and then from their work on the other versions

734
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Now, OLarmyEddie in our chat room says EA lies, lies

735
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
They all lie

736
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Interesting

737
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
By the way, also following up on the Second Life information, Tigerclaw in our chat says

738
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Also note that the credit card information was on another server and that wasn't compromised

739
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Okay

740
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
That's good

741
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Anyways, if you're really into Sims stuff, you might be interested in this

742
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
No, this doesn't have to do with The Sims

743
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Some other gaming series, Sid Meier's is actually being

744
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,000
They're releasing a wonderful collection, which is going to be coming to the stores pretty soon here

745
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:40,000
It will be including quite a few different games, including Civilization I, Civ II, Civ II Fantastic Worlds, Civ II Conflicts in Civilization

746
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Civ II Tests of Time, Civ III, Civ III Play the World, and Civ III Conquest, and finally Civ IV

747
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
So a whole bunch of Civilization for you

748
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
But to be honest, if you're a Civilization fan, you probably have all that shit already

749
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I mean, is there anything special that doesn't, you know

750
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Well, you get a Civilization card game, a 96-page book of artwork

751
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Ooh, artwork

752
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:14,000
And a DVD featuring lead designer Soren Johnson and artist Dorian Newcomb and talking about the creation of Civ IV

753
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Now, I really can't bash this too much because I've said it on this show before, Civilization, the original

754
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:24,000
The first one that ever came out on the PC is hands down my favorite PC game ever, ever

755
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I love the original Civilization

756
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Don't ask me, I can't get into Civ II, III the same

757
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I haven't tried IV yet, I really want to

758
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I can't get into II and III the same way I can the original

759
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
What were you doing this for? Are you saying I'm too stupid to get II and III?

760
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
No, I'm saying the entirety of Civ goes right over my head

761
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Seriously, I don't know if...

762
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
There's got to be a way you can get Civilization I really cheap now

763
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I highly urge you guys to check it out

764
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Civ II is not bad either, really, I mean, it's not bad

765
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I just didn't enjoy it as much as I

766
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
So, seriously, check these games out

767
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
It's a great, great landmark game in PC history

768
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I absolutely love Civ I

769
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I used to play Civ Net back in the day

770
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
But, you know, I have to admit

771
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Actually, something like this, to me, who hasn't followed the Civ series for a long time

772
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
This almost sounds appealing

773
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
But I don't know, I don't know if I have that much time

774
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Civilization is one of those things

775
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
When I was playing Civilization on the PC, I literally was not playing anything else, ever

776
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
So, I don't know

777
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Nerd

778
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Yeah, I am, a little bit

779
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Speaking of nerds, many of you out there on the internet like to email us every week

780
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
And we're here to read your emails on air

781
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Don't roll your eyes at me, Dark Sakura

782
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I wasn't rolling my eyes

783
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:36,000
And the queen nerd, Dark Sakura, is here to read those emails for you every week

784
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I'm the queen nerd, you're the king dork

785
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
So, suit up the rubber gloves in this besto suit

786
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
And tell us who's emailed us at Mailbag at OrangeOnTrader.com this week

787
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I do want to go ahead and actually repeat the ages-old disclaimer

788
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
If you send us hate mail, all we're going to do is laugh at you

789
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Yeah, so we had a couple ha-has this week, which was great

790
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Thank you for the hate mail

791
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
It was the most ridiculous thing I've ever read

792
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Anyway, so back

793
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Actually, we need more, because I didn't laugh enough this week

794
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
So please send us more hate mail, actually

795
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
And hate mail means you were listening

796
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
So thank you for downloading our podcast

797
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Seriously

798
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
You know what's funny about that hate mail that I read?

799
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
It's obvious that the people were listening to the show regularly

800
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
So hey, cool, new listener

801
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I didn't see the one that was towards you

802
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Doesn't matter

803
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Anyway, we got one that is not crap

804
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
From Renee

805
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
I guess it's Renee? Yeah

806
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Hello Jamie Skye and Loki, but mostly Jamie as you're the only one who mostly reads these emails

807
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I was looking through the PEGI, Pan-European Game Information website

808
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Which is a video game rating board

809
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Reported that video games are actually good for you

810
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Here is a link, it's an old article, July 12th, 2006

811
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
But at least we know that Europe loves video games

812
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:59,000
It's sort of a long URL, but I'll just go over some highlights

813
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:06,000
It was about a meeting that was in Brussels on July 6th, 2006

814
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
That had the consumers, publishers, developers of video games

815
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
In the European Union involved in this

816
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
They were including parent representatives

817
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Panels of expert psychologists, media specialists

818
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Who were just discussing the whole thing from what I was reading in this article

819
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:30,000
And there's actually a quote on here that I liked

820
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
In light of such a thorough analysis of current issues and such a lively dialogue

821
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
We should not let this intellectual stimulation die out

822
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:42,000
ISFE will see to building upon this exchange and make it happen on a permanent and regular basis

823
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
But as they were going through they were saying

824
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,000
They were just reviewing the different perceptions based on all sides of the issue

825
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:56,000
And that it was coming through that basically that games have innovative effects

826
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,000
You can use them for education, treatment of behavior problems, attention deficit disorder

827
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
They're even going into manned space exploration

828
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
There's all kinds of different applications that video games themselves apply to

829
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:14,000
If our army is using them then there's got to be something there

830
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Where the hell was that kind of information when my parents wouldn't let me get a game system when I was in high school?

831
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
I'm posting in the chatroom right now

832
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Video games do not rot your brain

833
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:39,000
The television does and then the aliens suck your face off just like in that episode of Doctor Who

834
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I play video games on the television

835
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Moving on

836
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Wow this is a long one too

837
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I guess I'm going to go over this I'm not sure

838
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Wow this is a very long email

839
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Sorry

840
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I'm just going to say this is from Kenji

841
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Congratulations on your upcoming 200 episodes

842
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I've been watching OLR since the late 80 episodes

843
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
And while I've been unable to watch you guys on a consistent basis

844
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
That's amazing seeing we're a radio program

845
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I applaud your perseverance against the Mackinac dominant big wig video game journalist

846
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:29,000
I have a feeling this is going to be a long email please brace yourselves

847
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I went into the email box and actually read the email

848
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Was this the one that was about the really in depth analysis about Sony?

849
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,000
I think I could be crossing my wires here

850
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:46,000
E3 and Mardi Gras

851
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Oh yeah there's a Sony Microsoft deal gameplay

852
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
It's fairly long there's a lot of good bits in this

853
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,000
I read over it in the time that I had available to me

854
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Maybe we should post it in the forums

855
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
I'm going to

856
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Pick one paragraph from the letter to read so at least we have something to respond to here

857
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
It's long okay

858
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
No it's okay I'll go with the gameplay

859
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Since the handheld love the adoration for everyone's favorite innocently yet so vulgarly named Wii

860
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Games with the ability to simply pick up and play and of all things retro gaming

861
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
CD and television lives

862
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Sorry I guess television lives console and target the mock up 2600s that are announced

863
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:42,000
That now store pretty much every good Atari game within its tape deck like cabinet

864
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,000
The TV games that were on everyone's Christmas wish list a year ago or so

865
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Because there is a growing community that realizes that maybe the forefathers of video gaming had something going

866
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:59,000
On graphically sucked balls great description but it still has the staying power due to its at the time imaginative gameplay

867
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Super Mario Brothers was beautiful in the fact that it only took at most two lives for even the most dimwitted of people

868
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
To get the hang of what you had to do and the list goes on and on

869
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
I'm going to keep going a little bit

870
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
In fact what do the majority of people who game on their PS

871
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:18,000
PS use NES SNES Neo Geo and Genesis emulators nonetheless

872
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
That's a good point

873
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Gunpei who let's see Mr. Yokoi's magnum opus for the Wonderswan is now being remade for the current generations

874
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,000
And touch generations are catering to a whole new type of game

875
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Our Xbox Live Arcade is an ingenious Microsoft strategy that I applaud even if I do load their very being

876
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Yeah it's a really long email and actually if you don't mind I would like to actually put this letter up on our forums

877
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Alright

878
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
So if you're listening which we hope if you're listening to the podcast right now

879
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Just shoot me an email at jamieatorangegeldradio.com and let me know if you're fine with that

880
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Sweet

881
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
You know just to respond to that about the retro gaming I think the person's got a good point there

882
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I love Xbox Live Arcade as well that practically sold the system for me

883
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Because the launch titles didn't you know rock my world but I knew that arcade was like this great thing

884
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
And there were a couple launch titles I wanted

885
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:22,000
But I think even if a game is old and has basic graphics doesn't mean it's going to be a bad game

886
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
And I think people do have a lot of respect for the retro graphics

887
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:32,000
And you know of course a little game called Geometry Wars I think woke everybody up to that fact really in this next gen battle

888
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:38,000
So I think you are going to see the retro factor really start to kind of crank up a little bit in this next gen

889
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:46,000
There's actually a very good comparison to one of Tezuka's comics

890
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,000
And I guess the current industry I really want to put this up on the site

891
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
It's very long and I'm not going to do it just reading it over the air

892
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
So I'd really like permission to post it up on the site just let me know please

893
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Alright any more emails?

894
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Oh yeah

895
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Alright

896
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
No I have no more email

897
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:08,000
One week you weren't here I went into the mail bag and there was like nothing there

898
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
They knew Jamie was gone so I was like ok no need to email

899
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Hey watch that ego

900
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Hey my email is great

901
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Ok this is from I guess Stickaxe I don't have a signature on here so I'm just going to go

902
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Oh Eric sorry

903
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,000
You guys are absolutely the greatest audio only entertainment out there no questions asked

904
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
My name is Eric and I write to you from Indiana

905
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Loki you are amazing, awesome, superior, great, mighty, sweet, strong, marvelous, almighty, godlike, admirable, excellent

906
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Satisfying, pleasing, respectable, gnarly, stupendous, and honorable

907
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Who is that?

908
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
What?

909
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
No I

910
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Who was that?

911
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
That they were talking about?

912
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
I missed

913
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
They were talking about Loki

914
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Oh ok

915
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Apparently

916
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Oh is this the one that

917
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Yeah that was the one I mentioned

918
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Oh that's not hardly you

919
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
No I know it's funny

920
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Ok so Jamie you are just absolutely amazing

921
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Oh thank you

922
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:03,000
This guy I'm sorry man but you honestly have to try and shut up for more than 10 seconds at a time

923
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
As he drinks his ginger beer

924
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Not talking

925
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob

926
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Nope sorry can't talk listeners don't like me talking

927
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Rob

928
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
I talk too damn much

929
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
I like you talking

930
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
I like you talking

931
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Nope I make this show too gay I can't talk anymore

932
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,000
This Rob is, this Rob, our show is

933
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
This Rob is gay, this Rob is very gay

934
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
What is wrong with this Rob?

935
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
He's so gay he gays up Orange Line Radio

936
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Rob is our facilitator

937
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Rob is our facilitator

938
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Look maybe I do talk too much it's fine

939
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
You know what it's just

940
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Keep in mind kids what I do for a living

941
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
I talk all day to people and they are paid to listen to me

942
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I'm a trainer basically

943
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
So you know I just I can't shut up it's my nature I'm sorry

944
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Mhmm

945
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Hugs and kisses

946
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,000
With all of that out of the way I was seriously wondering something

947
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
You probably, by the way the one I got was crap

948
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
But okay

949
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
But um probably mentioned it on one of your earlier shows so I apologize

950
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I'm a big fanboy of the show Stargate SG-1 Oh I Love You

951
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,000
And last year I heard there was going to be a Stargate SG-1 video game coming out later that year

952
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I was really excited about it at first and sort of forgot about it as time went on

953
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
It's now late 2006 and I haven't heard anything about it

954
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Was it cancelled or was it out?

955
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Or am I just not seeing it do you guys know?

956
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
I do know

957
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
I freaking played it in E3

958
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I was like oh my god Stargate because I am a big Stargate fangirl

959
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Okay I have all eight box sets and I'm eagerly awaiting the ninth

960
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
And I was like they made a life sized Stargate thing up here

961
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:44,000
And I like wanted to stand in it and see if if I if the big you know if the event horizon was splashed out at me and everything

962
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Except that that would have vaporized me so I would have stayed out of the way

963
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Do you mean?

964
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:54,000
I know the answer I know the answer to the guys question but I can't talk

965
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
It was cancelled they did cancel it

966
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:04,000
If you want however I did take pictures of their area I took pictures of the game

967
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I can get all that up actually it's I should our gallery from that E3 should still be up

968
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
I think it is

969
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:16,000
So a lot of my pictures are there you can check them out on in our picture gallery on orangeoutradio.com

970
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Everyone remembers why did they cancel that because Stargate really does have a nerd-tastic following to it

971
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
That's not a bad thing it's a good show

972
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:28,000
It's a first person shooter and I think it was really great

973
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I wish they had kept going with it because I mean I would have bought that day one

974
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Solarwing in the chat room read my mind Battlestar Galactica the video game

975
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
That's just a matter of time yes?

976
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,000
One would hope I want a Doctor Who video game because I'm into my Doctor Who fandom

977
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
But as for the very end I'm also becoming a bit confused

978
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Would it be possible for you guys to list every gaming console you have ever owned in your long lifespan please?

979
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:55,000
We do not have a show long enough because I still currently own them

980
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Unless you've got time for me to list off about 47 video game systems sorry

981
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:08,000
You know I was just thinking if they made video games out of TV shows I watch

982
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Video game industry would die

983
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Big Brother the video game

984
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
For anyone that reads my live journal I never talk about games I just talk about the TV show Big Brother

985
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Can you imagine Big Brother the video game

986
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Three people in my car me who does not watch TV I just buy box sets talking about Big Brother

987
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Press the A button to continue

988
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
But first a live eviction never mind

989
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
If you watch Big Brother you get it

990
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Anyway Eric thanks for writing in and yeah no more Stargate that pisses me off too

991
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,000
I am such a Stargate fangirl because it's all about Michael Shanks

992
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Even though you hate me I'm mad about the Stargate news too

993
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
He doesn't hate you

994
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
DMN hates me there it is in chat

995
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
What?

996
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
I love you

997
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
DMN you bastard

998
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
He doesn't really hate me and look

999
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Solarwing says Big Brother could be an MMO vidpower admits to watching Big Brother

1000
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:11,000
I know we have UK listeners and I know it's a completely different show here than it is over there

1001
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
But I know it's crazy over there

1002
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Anyway sorry video games yes

1003
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Okay this one comes from Distinct

1004
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Hey all the store I run sells games and we've got release dates for Wii games coming November 1

1005
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
I know these usually change a lot

1006
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:31,000
But I think if Nintendo was going to do an October launch then the games would be listed for October

1007
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,000
So it looks like to me the Wii is going to drop a week or two before the PS3

1008
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Which we have dates for games as well and they're all around the same time as the PS3 launch

1009
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Here are some release dates for other titles

1010
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Loki probably is on top of this already

1011
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
But in case something is different from what you've heard

1012
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Lost Planet Xbox 360 January 31

1013
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Soprano Xbox 360 November 14

1014
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Darkness Xbox 360 March 31

1015
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Superman Xbox 360 December 1

1016
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Rainbow Six Vegas on Xbox 360 November 15

1017
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,000
And a lot of other titles dropping the same time as the PS3 launch

1018
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Oddly enough we have no confirmed date for Gears of War

1019
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Which actually had a date announced to the press

1020
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Anyway great show I thought I'd try and give some info but like I said you probably noticed this already

1021
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Did you post some of that? I don't know I don't remember

1022
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Well I mean it's different sources though because this person says they work on the retail end

1023
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,000
So sometimes it's interesting to see where the distribution end and where you are in the retail end

1024
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Where this listener is you know

1025
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,000
That's pretty accurate we've got dates that are in November and we've got dates that are

1026
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,000
We have a lot that are in November 1st and a lot that are on the 15th

1027
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I think those are all placeholder dates right now

1028
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
But it is supposed to be like we mentioned last week

1029
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
No it wasn't last week it was the week before last I think

1030
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
I can't remember I get my weeks old script

1031
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,000
As we mentioned it is going to be probably a November launch

1032
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,000
And that was a big you know to do thing

1033
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Also what was I going to say? I thought the Supranus game was cancelled

1034
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
I think it was I thought it was

1035
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Yeah I thought it was

1036
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,000
But yeah our purchasing people haven't taken it out of our system either

1037
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
But I know

1038
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Maybe it wasn't

1039
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
You know I was cleaning up my Xbox hard drive this week

1040
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
And I was deleting the Superman Returns trailer for the game

1041
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
And I watched it one more time and I think I might want to pick up that game

1042
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
I really might

1043
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Sometimes it's not as awful as the one that was on the Nintendo 64

1044
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Oh yeah no no no

1045
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
At E3 it was awesome

1046
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Imagine Grand Theft Auto but you're Superman

1047
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Hey I'd be all over that

1048
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
It'll be as badass as Superman on the Atari 2600 was

1049
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Or maybe what was it?

1050
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Death and Return of Superman one of the few beat-em-ups Blizzard ever made

1051
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Okay well anyways

1052
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,000
While we're on the subject here I thought I would you know clear up a few things

1053
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Let's see as far as release dates go

1054
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
I think that was about right

1055
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Remember I know Lost Planet is coming out in January

1056
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Because they were saying that no other games are coming out in January

1057
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
And you'll pretty much own January

1058
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Now I know there have been a lot of

1059
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
I'm sure that you saw this too

1060
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
In our wonderful Under the Radar thread that we have in our forums

1061
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
There have been a lot of the stories that we've been talking about

1062
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Have appeared and reported by other news sources

1063
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,000
As well as you know current topics and people have been sourcing them

1064
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Like for example I think when we talked about winning the 11th revolution in 2007

1065
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Bobby we mentioned this and freaking goes to IGN you know

1066
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Who reported the exact same thing

1067
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Bobby bad Bobby Black Wolf

1068
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
I know he doesn't listen to the show very much but

1069
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Bad Bobby no cookie for you

1070
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Well to go ahead and gear this back towards the email

1071
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,000
You've got a story coming up that addresses something we brought up last week

1072
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
You're trying to make a preemptive strike here

1073
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Let her finish the damn email

1074
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Warrior Bob writes in and says

1075
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Hey there OLR crew it's been like a year or something since I've written in

1076
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
But you're still awesome and I'm still listening

1077
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Thanks for all the great podcasts

1078
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Comments for each of you

1079
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Sky I was just listening to your last podcast and you were asking about

1080
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Disconnects in Street Fighter 2 HF on Xbox Live

1081
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Well I can assure you that a disconnect counts as a win for the person who didn't disconnect

1082
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Oh

1083
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Because I got my achievement for 20 wins online when the other guy timed out

1084
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Hot okay good

1085
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Good to know thank you

1086
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Loki

1087
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:28,000
So a friend of mine runs a college radio show about video games at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo

1088
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
And called me on frequently as a co-host

1089
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Like any person I've got influence in how I approach something

1090
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,000
And after a few months of broadcasting I realized that even if I don't agree with you all the time

1091
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Even most of the time

1092
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Your style on air is basically my biggest influence and I wanted to write and say so

1093
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
So that you can have the ego boost you rightfully deserve

1094
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Aww

1095
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
My style on air

1096
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
That was the equivalent of a man hug I think

1097
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
That was very nice

1098
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
One to me by right is a false icon

1099
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Yes

1100
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Damn them to hell

1101
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Wow my ears are ringing

1102
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Sorry

1103
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
I held the microphone away

1104
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Oh I know

1105
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Didn't help me in studio

1106
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,000
You guys all rule and I look forward to this week's show just like I do every week take care

1107
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Aww so nice

1108
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Aww I love the ego boost email

1109
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Maybe we should run down to Cal Poly and do a show

1110
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
I think so

1111
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Was that the same person that wanted us to go there to do some type of panel thingy

1112
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
That was about a year ago

1113
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
We couldn't make it at that time

1114
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
It didn't work out unfortunately but

1115
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
We need to go on the road

1116
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
We need to go on a college tour across America

1117
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Make sure that you have kegs with good beer

1118
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Just bring Guinness kegs

1119
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Bring Guinness bring bass

1120
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Dronami will be our roadie

1121
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Bring me some fat tire

1122
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Chris can be our tour manager

1123
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Uhh sure

1124
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
She can bring us coffee and donuts

1125
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Oh yes and lesbian

1126
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:52,000
There will be massive lesbian pillow fights at every after party

1127
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Huh Loki? Huh? Huh?

1128
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
I guess

1129
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Me I'm old I go to bed early

1130
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Alright next

1131
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
I like pillow fights

1132
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Next email

1133
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Hey O.L.R. this is from DMN oh my god

1134
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Hi DMN and this is the one that I said I would read

1135
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,000
I was wondering what your opinion on Guitar Hero 2 retailing for $49.99

1136
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
This being for the game only

1137
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Do you guys think that with this being the first music game being priced for over $40

1138
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
That the sales of this game will be hampered

1139
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Or will this encourage the sale of the bundle to people who already own the game

1140
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Also your thoughts on Dance Factory thanks

1141
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,000
I haven't played Dance Factory yet so I can't give a fair opinion on it

1142
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Same here

1143
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Maybe I'll check it out but it honestly

1144
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,000
I've seen these dance games that use your own music before

1145
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,000
And haven't been very impressed so I don't see where this one's gonna win me over

1146
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
It thinks it's accurate but it's not

1147
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,000
It can't make accurate steps the same way that a step artist

1148
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
To borrow a term from Roxor can

1149
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:57,000
So it can't be as good as DDR in the groove even

1150
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
I can't imagine

1151
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:03,000
As far as Guitar Hero 2 going for $49.99 I do think that's a bit excessive for price

1152
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:07,000
I think that for those of us who already have it

1153
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:12,000
The game should retail around I'd say between $30 and $40

1154
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,000
And make a really good deal for the guitar bundle

1155
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,000
It's like $60 for the guitar bundle or something like that

1156
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:23,000
That's how I think it should be $50 for the game only is excessive I believe

1157
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Alright

1158
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Given that I spent that on the guitar and game bundle last time

1159
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Well you know everybody's gonna pay it anyway

1160
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Yeah

1161
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Is that it for email?

1162
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
By the way Addict

1163
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Oh shit

1164
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Who played last week's show for her?

1165
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
She's not supposed to

1166
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
No

1167
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,000
My informant in the chatroom right now told me

1168
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,000
And I was gonna say something last week and I took mercy on you

1169
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,000
But DEAR GOD IN HEAVEN WHY

1170
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Rob is back on Final Fantasy XI

1171
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
You traitor

1172
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,000
You are a traitor and a liar

1173
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,000
And you need to be spanked

1174
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Chris spank him for me

1175
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,000
A little harder please

1176
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
You

1177
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Quit World of Warcraft

1178
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
I can't quit World of Warcraft

1179
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
My account is still active

1180
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:23,000
You sit down and you sit down in your goddamn chair and drink your goddamn tea

1181
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Orange Lounge Radio is quite possibly the only podcast

1182
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Video game podcast on the entire internet

1183
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,000
That has lesbian spanking gay men

1184
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Over MMOs

1185
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:43,000
And to correct myself is sit your ass down in that chair and drink your goddamn tea

1186
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Lesbians are always relevant

1187
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
I um

1188
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
You have a hot ass Rob

1189
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Thank you

1190
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Um

1191
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Mikotov

1192
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Gave me cookies

1193
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
I don't know what else to say

1194
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Oh my god

1195
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:05,000
GS68 said that I was using a level 4 limit break

1196
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:09,000
And DJ Janae wants me to hit him with the yaoi paddle stick

1197
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
I need to make one

1198
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Okay

1199
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
What's this we're going to yaoi con?

1200
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
I heard that coming out of your mouth

1201
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
I heard this we're going to

1202
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:23,000
No, we as in me and Chris and Megzia and another one of our friends

1203
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Is going to yaoi con this year

1204
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
So we need to make yaoi behave paddles

1205
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Alright look we gotta wrap this up

1206
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Cause we still have DDR

1207
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
We saw the DDR previous to get to this segment

1208
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
And whoever that little rat informant is in chat

1209
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
I'm gonna find you I'm gonna get you

1210
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
I know it's DMN I know it's him

1211
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
No it's not DMN

1212
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Don't worry I'm going to own DMN anyway

1213
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
I'm going to figure out who you are I'm going to beat you up

1214
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Uh send an email

1215
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Mailbag at orange times radio

1216
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Sorry orange time I love you

1217
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
I'm coming to New York too

1218
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
And I'm bringing my yaoi paddle

1219
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
By the way

1220
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
DMN says fuck you Rob

1221
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Check

1222
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
You name the time and the place I'll be there no pants

1223
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Tape it

1224
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
New year

1225
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
I'm turning this car around

1226
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
And we are going back to on topic road

1227
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Right now

1228
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Check the orange times radio forums

1229
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Because Sky is coming to New York City

1230
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
In October and we'll be doing a meet up

1231
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
I think at the Nintendo store

1232
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Uh possibly somewhere else

1233
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
I'm not sure yet

1234
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
But check the forums for more information if you're in New York City

1235
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Cause I want to meet some fans

1236
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
And maybe tape a live segment or something

1237
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
I'll just have a part on the show

1238
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Alright back to games

1239
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Super Paper Mario a game I'm very very much looking forward to

1240
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
That was going to be coming out for the GameCube

1241
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Um is now not going to be coming out for the GameCube

1242
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Rumor

1243
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Well it's a rumor but this seems like a pretty good one to me

1244
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Rumored until Thursday when they announced it officially

1245
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:57,000
I don't understand why they would continue to build all these GameCube games

1246
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Well I mean I guess the Wii can play them

1247
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Yeah

1248
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
You know what I think

1249
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
This obviously is going to be coming out for the Wii

1250
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
This is coming off some IGN dude's blog

1251
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
That says hmm how should I write this

1252
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Have to be vague you know

1253
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Let me just say that yes Paper Mario will be headed to Wii and not GameCube

1254
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Now read between the lines damn you wait

1255
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
That was a terrible hint

1256
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Alright that's it for today time to beat Bozone

1257
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:25,000
And that was coming from Matt Casamassina from IGN

1258
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Who apparently gets more insider knowledge than we do

1259
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Whatever

1260
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Look I would bet anything maybe it's one of those games where

1261
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:39,000
There's more features on the Wii than there are on the GameCube

1262
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Not like Zelda where there's two separate versions

1263
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:47,000
But I think about those games like the Zelda games that were on the Color Game Boy

1264
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
When you put them in the advance you got the advance store

1265
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Like what was it Oracle of Ages Seasons whatever that was

1266
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
You had like extra stuff if you played it in the advance

1267
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
That would seem logical to me and a very Nintendo thing to do

1268
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
That's pretty interesting

1269
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:05,000
That Matt Casamassina or whatever guy really has the inside scoop

1270
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Oh wait no he doesn't

1271
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:11,000
That's right because he just did an interview with Ubisoft about GT

1272
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:15,000
And well he just found out guess what that they're coming out with

1273
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
I know that I'm sure it's the first that you've ever heard of it

1274
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
They're coming out with the steering wheel attachment

1275
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,000
That's going to come out for the Wii game GT

1276
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Wait a second didn't some podcast talk about that last week?

1277
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Okay to this credit though I'm actually going to give the doubt

1278
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:35,000
If they went to Ubisoft and talked about it directly they probably didn't get it from the show

1279
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:41,000
But doesn't that validate what you were saying last week at least part of it?

1280
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:48,000
What I'm saying I don't say that it's not legit and they stole the story or whatever the case may be

1281
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:53,000
I didn't say that at all but I'm just saying that I'm not just spouting off crap here

1282
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
That this stuff is actually real

1283
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Maybe you should fucking listen people

1284
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Seriously

1285
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
If anybody's wrong it's the sales people

1286
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
All you're doing is you're saying things the sales people told you

1287
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,000
But yeah it's very interesting I've been reading forums this week

1288
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Because we've been getting a lot of hits on that story

1289
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
And of course we can see where the hits are coming from

1290
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:14,000
It's very interesting to read people's opinions on our credibility

1291
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
For example other things that kind of go along with that

1292
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:22,000
1UP ran a story this week talking about the PS2 Slim coming out in a silver color

1293
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
As we reported on episode 196

1294
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Kotaku reported on a brand new PSP Entertainment bundle that's going to be coming out

1295
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,000
As we reported on episode 196

1296
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:38,000
This story of course we talked about came out last week we talked about that

1297
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:44,000
IGN also ran a story about the grim adventures of Billy and Mandy coming out for the Wii

1298
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
As reported on episode 195

1299
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
And then

1300
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Yeah so

1301
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
It's not a big surprise here

1302
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,000
You know what our t-shirts should have that big

1303
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Should have that picture of the alien spaceship that you see on it

1304
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,000
And it says I believe and then in parenthesis OLR

1305
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
That could be our shirts

1306
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:09,000
I want to believe OLR

1307
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:14,000
And as I was mentioning earlier when I was yelling at Bobby

1308
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,000
The thing was he was talking about a story today on his podcast

1309
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:24,000
About how Provolution Soccer 2007 is not going to be exclusive to the 360 as Microsoft stated

1310
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Well we also mentioned that I think it was on 198

1311
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
That that was not the case

1312
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
That it was actually still in development and that kind of stuff

1313
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Okay big deal

1314
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
We're just giving Bobby a hard time

1315
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
I know we love Bobby

1316
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Bobby is awesome but I always have to give him

1317
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Allgames.com Sunday night it's 5 o'clock

1318
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Bobby Black Wolf Show it's rad

1319
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
So alright

1320
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Are we ready for the next story?

1321
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Next story

1322
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
I don't know I think I'm going to like Boycott

1323
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Why?

1324
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Because I don't like this game

1325
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Well read it anyway

1326
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Anyway there is going to be a progressive scan in 16 to 9 widescreen mode

1327
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
For Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam

1328
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,000
On what system does it say?

1329
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Well it's only for the Wii

1330
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Oh the Wii?

1331
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,000
You know what that's neat that's great but not too surprising

1332
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Because when we saw Elibits at the Konami thing it was running widescreen

1333
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Yeah and I think they were supposed to be doing 480p and widescreen on the games anyways

1334
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Weren't all the games we saw at E3 on widescreen?

1335
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
I think so

1336
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,000
It's kind of weird

1337
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,000
I mean not to belittle your story but I'm just saying because somebody else picked up that story

1338
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,000
I'm just kind of like well weren't they all kind of showing in widescreen anyway?

1339
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,000
I don't know

1340
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Maybe because people are ragging on the graphics of the Wii saying it's not going to be as good as the other systems

1341
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,000
I think it looks fine

1342
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Here's something to show that hey at least they still support widescreen

1343
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
It's a little something

1344
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:57,000
And also they showed the first screenshots of GT on IGN

1345
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
And it actually looks pretty cool it's all cel-shaded

1346
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:04,000
So it kind of reminds me a little bit of like Crazy Taxi but a racing game

1347
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
So I don't know I like it

1348
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Alright cool

1349
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:15,000
I just wanted to point out as well I saw part of the reason that Final Fantasy 12 has taken an incredible amount of time to come out here in the US

1350
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Is that they actually added in the American version widescreen support

1351
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
So that's going to be pretty cool

1352
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,000
So you can have like in Dragon Quest 8 you know supported widescreen as well

1353
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Thank you Squeenix for supporting widescreen on the current gen consoles

1354
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,000
That's very nice of you

1355
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,000
I can't wait to check that out

1356
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Some interesting stuff that's going to be coming out also with the Wii

1357
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
And this is rumor for now

1358
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,000
A list of the launch titles for the virtual console

1359
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,000
And I think most of this is speculation but

1360
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:44,000
You know as I mentioned with the Wii date stories and anything like that that's going on

1361
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,000
We're going to know September 14th it's going to be the big news

1362
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
All this stuff so

1363
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,000
For now if you want to speculate on it in a couple days here you go

1364
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:59,000
The list some of the notables on there Box Adventure, Castlevania, Duck Hunt

1365
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Excitebike, F-Zero, Kid Icarus, The Legend of Zelda

1366
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,000
The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, Mario Kart 64

1367
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:11,000
The original Metroid, Mortal Kombat, New Adventure Island, Ninja Gaiden

1368
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Outrun, Pac-Man, Prince of Persia

1369
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
I imagine the original

1370
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Punch Out, R-Type, Rayman 2, Sonic the Hedgehog

1371
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Star Fox, Super Mario 64, Super Mario Brothers, Super Mario Kart

1372
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Super Mario World, and Tecmo Bowl

1373
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
It's so weird, a rat, the best football game ever made

1374
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
None of us need Blades of Steel

1375
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:37,000
But isn't it weird to hear R-Type and Outrun alongside Legend of Zelda and Kid Icarus

1376
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:42,000
By the way, thank you to somebody at Nintendo for showing Kid Icarus a little bit of love

1377
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,000
R-Type

1378
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:51,000
I want to know, I've only known two people who can beat R-Type on one credit

1379
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:56,000
I want to know who else of our listeners can do it, send me an email

1380
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:00,000
I want to know where some of the more Genesis games are

1381
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Because in the mail they'll probably just slowly roll out, don't you think?

1382
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,000
I don't know, I'm kind of a wait and see, I want to see how this thing's going to look

1383
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Because to be honest, the virtual console is awesome and stuff

1384
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
But it's not why I'm buying the system

1385
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Alright, well now we're going to get into a part of the show that I think a lot of you guys have been waiting for

1386
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:27,000
We're going to play some new tracks from the brand new DDR games, UltraMix 4 and DDR Universe

1387
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Of course, Dance Dance Revolution UltraMix 4 is coming out later this year for the Xbox

1388
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:35,000
You guys know the UltraMix series by now, it's brought a lot of great music to us

1389
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Synth-pop style music from a different drum label, as well as a lot of brand new mixes

1390
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,000
And the last game especially was really diverse in the selection

1391
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Even some folks criticized it for how diverse it was

1392
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,000
But it's going to be interesting, I think you're going to find that UltraMix 4

1393
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,000
The song list was previously announced and posted to our website

1394
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:57,000
There's a lot of very interesting and diverse tracks in this game as well

1395
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:01,000
A lot of new originals, and we're going to be playing for the next few weeks on our show

1396
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:04,000
So not just tonight guys, but over the next few weeks

1397
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Every week we're going to be doing some previews of new tracks from DDR UltraMix 4 and DDR Universe

1398
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,000
DDR Universe being the game that's coming out for the Xbox 360

1399
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Either later this year or early, early next year

1400
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:21,000
It's still a little bit unknown, I think they're still aiming for this year on the Xbox 360

1401
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:26,000
And that's of course DDR's first, well your system is saying December still, right?

1402
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Yeah

1403
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Sounds good, that'll be good

1404
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,000
American Idol, Karaoke Revolution got pushed to January

1405
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Oh, that's a bummer

1406
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Well maybe it's to actually get Paula in

1407
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,000
I think so

1408
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,000
That would be nice, that would be nice

1409
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Well that makes sense though, because American Idol would come out when the show comes out, right?

1410
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:44,000
I thought December was a bit early for American Idol, because the show doesn't start until January

1411
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Alright, well anyway, let's get into the DDR

1412
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:53,000
So, tonight we're going to debut two songs from DDR Universe and two songs from DDR UltraMix 4

1413
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,000
And that's pretty much going to be the same rhythm we're going to do throughout the promotion

1414
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
As two songs from each game each week

1415
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,000
And I guess we should just get it started, shouldn't we?

1416
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:05,000
So here's tonight's first song, tonight's first song is from DDR Universe

1417
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:10,000
And this first one is going to be a long version, because we have some long versions sprinkled out throughout the promotion

1418
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,000
This is a brand new original song, and it's by an artist called Drew Campbell

1419
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,000
And the song is called 8-Bit

1420
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:22,000
And I think what you're going to dig about this song is that the title describes the sound of the song

1421
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,000
So I think you guys are going to really dig this track

1422
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:33,000
So here it is, to kick off our series of DDR Sneak Peaks here on Orange Lounge Radio

1423
01:20:33,000 --> 01:21:01,000
This is Drew Campbell with 8-Bit from DDR Universe, the long version

1424
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:13,000
So here it is, to kick off our series of DDR Sneak Peaks here on Orange Lounge Radio

1425
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:43,000

1426

01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:13,000
So here it is, to kick off our series of DDR Sneak Peaks

1429
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:43,000
So here it is, to kick off our series of DDR Sneak Peaks

1430
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Coming soon to DDR Universe, that was Drew Campbell with 8-Bit here on Orange Lounge Radio

1431
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
The DDR Sneak previews

1432
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:29,000
And speaking of 8-Bit, we've been running a contest here on the program recently

1433
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:35,000
It's called Beat the Host, and it had to do with guessing the songs that we were playing from 8-Bit video games of the past

1434
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,000
And we have one of the winners on the line with us tonight

1435
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Say hello to DMN everybody, how are you doing DMN?

1436
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
I'm doing pretty good, Rob

1437
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Alright, well as part of the prize, you and Raven's Dolphin get to introduce new songs

1438
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Are you a big DDR fan?

1439
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Absolutely

1440
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Alright, well get to it, you're going to introduce one of the new songs here from Dance Dance Revolution Ultra Mix 4

1441
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,000
What are they hearing tonight?

1442
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:01,000
You're going to be listening to Edge of Control by Jondi and Spesh

1443
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Here it is, Edge of Control by Jondi and Spesh here on Orange Lounge Radio

1444
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Yeah!

1445
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Yeah!

1446
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Edge of Control by Jondi and Spesh here on the DDR Sneak Peaks

1447
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Alright, we're going to get into another song here, another track tonight from DDR Universe

1448
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,000
And I'm very excited about this song we're going to play for you guys

1449
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Because it involves a long time favorite DDR artist here at Orange Lounge Radio

1450
01:26:54,000 --> 01:27:01,000
It's a remix of a song from the Echoing Green, so this is coming to us I believe from the A Different Drum License

1451
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
And it's remixed by Echo Image

1452
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:08,000
So here it is from DDR Universe, this is Echoing Green

1453
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Remixed by Echo Image, Heart With a View here on Orange Lounge Radio, DDR Sneak Peaks

1454
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Do you find that you're haunted by reflections in your eyes?

1455
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Do you mind that you're haunted?

1456
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Look into the sky, feel the wind blow

1457
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Look into my eyes, there's a place to go but I can't sense the sun

1458
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:16,000
There's a pain that won't stop the sun

1459
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:27,000
There's a place to go but I can't sense the sun

1460
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:37,000
There's a place to go but I can't sense the sun

1461
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:47,000
