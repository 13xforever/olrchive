00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:25,167
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, September 10th, 2006, Sony screws over Europe and then some, Chips for the Wii have been in production for a while now, and we premiere new DDR songs in our DDR sneak peeks.

2
00:00:32,745 --> 00:00:36,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,966 --> 00:00:45,109
[SPEAKER_03]: We are that independent video game podcast dedicated to video games that don't suck and video game culture and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:46,369
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here to help you through it.

5
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:47,429
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts.

6
00:00:47,449 --> 00:00:48,470
[SPEAKER_03]: You might know me as Sky.

7
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:55,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Joining me as always, say hello to my lovely co-host in that corner, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:55,452 --> 00:00:55,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

9
00:00:56,132 --> 00:00:56,993
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing, Missy?

10
00:00:57,713 --> 00:00:59,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I'm doing okay.

11
00:00:59,274 --> 00:01:00,195
[SPEAKER_03]: I love your new shirt.

12
00:01:00,215 --> 00:01:00,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

13
00:01:00,555 --> 00:01:03,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Will you please share with the listeners what your new shirt is and where you got this?

14
00:01:03,537 --> 00:01:04,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, what was that place called, Chris?

15
00:01:04,957 --> 00:01:05,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God, I forgot.

16
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:08,260
[SPEAKER_05]: It was someplace on, um, Hate.

17
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently it's called Oh, God, I Forgot is the name of the store.

18
00:01:11,702 --> 00:01:17,405
[SPEAKER_05]: But on the front it says, Oh, Army, and the back it says Dark Sakura with a zero like a team jersey, and it's red and black.

19
00:01:18,826 --> 00:01:22,268
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to get one and it's going to say Rob Roberts and the number 69.

20
00:01:22,308 --> 00:01:24,209
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be awesome.

21
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:25,310
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

22
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:27,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, also over there, Loki, what's your number going to be?

23
00:01:27,806 --> 00:01:28,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Techmaster Loki.

24
00:01:29,928 --> 00:01:31,810
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess 13 would be cool.

25
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:32,710
[SPEAKER_02]: 13 would be cool.

26
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Or 666 would be good for you.

27
00:01:34,852 --> 00:01:37,454
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we don't want to have too many sixes because, you know.

28
00:01:38,257 --> 00:01:41,559
[SPEAKER_02]: The six and nine both are kind of like sixes, and then I'd have 666.

29
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:43,020
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd just be too weird.

30
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,841
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes no sense at all, but I like your shirt.

31
00:01:45,101 --> 00:01:46,742
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a shirt that says Vader was framed.

32
00:01:47,182 --> 00:01:50,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this I got as a gift from Eric and Melissa.

33
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:51,985
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, sounds good.

34
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:53,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy early birthday.

35
00:01:54,126 --> 00:01:54,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

36
00:01:55,487 --> 00:01:59,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt's birthday is tomorrow, September 11th, a day that is easy to remember.

37
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:02,351
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I never forget Matt's birthday because it's easier to remember for some reason.

38
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:05,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because if you forget, we'll drive another plane into a tower.

39
00:02:06,943 --> 00:02:08,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving right along.

40
00:02:09,165 --> 00:02:10,666
[SPEAKER_05]: My birthday was the Waco deal.

41
00:02:28,427 --> 00:02:29,067
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing, Chris?

42
00:02:29,347 --> 00:02:29,808
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm okay.

43
00:02:30,028 --> 00:02:32,549
[SPEAKER_06]: I got here kind of late and I fucked up your intro.

44
00:02:32,589 --> 00:02:33,209
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.

45
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:34,410
[SPEAKER_06]: By bringing you crack.

46
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:39,292
[SPEAKER_03]: The podcast listeners don't know that because we edit the show when we fuck up.

47
00:02:39,312 --> 00:02:39,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

48
00:02:39,772 --> 00:02:40,573
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all right.

49
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:42,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, podcast listeners, he fucked up.

50
00:02:42,534 --> 00:02:44,875
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a faulty start this evening, but that's all right.

51
00:02:45,475 --> 00:02:49,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello as well to a moldy favorite, Drunami.

52
00:02:49,317 --> 00:02:51,538
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you have to ask what my number is going to be.

53
00:02:51,898 --> 00:02:52,698
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Drunami.

54
00:02:52,738 --> 00:02:53,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'm Drunami.

55
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:53,759
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah!

56
00:02:55,495 --> 00:02:57,116
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Tetris on Kristen's DS while having our hair done.

57
00:03:21,078 --> 00:03:23,981
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never played DS while getting my hair done, but that's a good thought.

58
00:03:24,201 --> 00:03:25,082
[SPEAKER_05]: I was processing.

59
00:03:25,322 --> 00:03:27,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have to put your hair on one of those giant dryers where you can't hear anything?

60
00:03:27,784 --> 00:03:28,124
[SPEAKER_05]: No, she did.

61
00:03:28,404 --> 00:03:28,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

62
00:03:28,865 --> 00:03:29,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you did?

63
00:03:29,385 --> 00:03:36,451
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was while he touched up my roots, and I have actually a black streak now on either side, but you can't tell because I have my hair pulled back.

64
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:41,515
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was sitting there playing Tetris, and I couldn't see.

65
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,217
[SPEAKER_05]: I had it right up in front of my face because I'm blind.

66
00:03:44,917 --> 00:03:46,659
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I ended up...

67
00:03:48,766 --> 00:03:49,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Just playing that.

68
00:03:49,747 --> 00:03:51,008
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, I play pinball.

69
00:03:52,048 --> 00:03:52,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you guys get a new machine?

70
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:54,150
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a new machine.

71
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:59,434
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Star Trek The Next Generation and Dan's apparently been working on it the whole time I've been gone.

72
00:04:00,955 --> 00:04:01,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.

73
00:04:03,016 --> 00:04:04,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, anything you've been playing this week?

74
00:04:05,758 --> 00:04:07,199
[SPEAKER_02]: I played Saints Row.

75
00:04:08,635 --> 00:04:13,116
[SPEAKER_02]: I was bored during lunch one day, so I tried climbing the mountain that's on the side of the map.

76
00:04:13,596 --> 00:04:15,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, there's an invisible wall, so you can't do that.

77
00:04:15,997 --> 00:04:22,898
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was really high in the air, so I decided to shoot rockets down at cars, because that's, of course, the only thing you want to do if you're really high up in the air.

78
00:04:23,378 --> 00:04:24,359
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did that, and that was fun.

79
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:27,139
[SPEAKER_02]: And what else did I do?

80
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:29,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I finished Blazing Angels, finally.

81
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:34,821
[SPEAKER_02]: I have all 1,000 achievement points now for it, so I can sell it back.

82
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,202
[SPEAKER_03]: That game you hate that you talk about in this segment...

83
00:04:38,582 --> 00:04:40,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Every single week for like the past 15 weeks.

84
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:41,965
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate it.

85
00:04:42,285 --> 00:04:43,106
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do hate it.

86
00:04:43,286 --> 00:04:43,906
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?

87
00:04:44,087 --> 00:04:44,607
[SPEAKER_02]: It's done.

88
00:04:45,228 --> 00:04:45,528
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

89
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:48,502
[SPEAKER_03]: The talk of a true achievement point score.

90
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:50,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I have a question when it comes to achievement points.

91
00:04:51,184 --> 00:04:55,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I was looking at one of those sites that has, like, the leaderboards and will show you everybody's gamer score.

92
00:04:55,608 --> 00:04:58,150
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was, like, mygamercard.net is a big site that has that.

93
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:02,953
[SPEAKER_03]: And, like, the person with the most points has, like, 53,000 gamers points.

94
00:05:03,494 --> 00:05:07,037
[SPEAKER_03]: How does anyone on Earth have the time to get that many points?

95
00:05:07,197 --> 00:05:12,020
[SPEAKER_02]: They all have a job and they live at home and they just play games all day, all night.

96
00:05:12,261 --> 00:05:13,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's kind of sad.

97
00:05:13,802 --> 00:05:15,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's ridiculous, but...

98
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:18,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever, I mean, if they want to spend the time to do that.

99
00:05:18,763 --> 00:05:25,044
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not crazy like that, but I do like, if I'm going to sell a game back, I do want to make sure I have all the points out of it.

100
00:05:25,584 --> 00:05:32,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, in the case of the outfit, I just don't fucking care because the game's so awful that I'll just sell it back without even touching it.

101
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,126
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, so whatever.

102
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:38,887
[SPEAKER_03]: We have another guest that's always with us every week, and that is our chat room, available at orangeonstrater.com.

103
00:05:38,907 --> 00:05:41,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Click on chat, and VidPala has a comment to all this.

104
00:05:41,827 --> 00:05:45,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Gamer points are like the new E-peen, as in E-penis, so...

105
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:48,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.

106
00:06:05,367 --> 00:06:06,547
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's essential.

107
00:06:08,828 --> 00:06:09,668
[SPEAKER_02]: What else have I been playing?

108
00:06:09,848 --> 00:06:11,049
[SPEAKER_02]: I've played some live arcade stuff.

109
00:06:11,249 --> 00:06:15,570
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually been playing more like Galaga and stuff.

110
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:21,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Nelly's been playing a lot of Bejeweled 2, so I stole one of the games from her and I played that.

111
00:06:22,372 --> 00:06:25,112
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty much it, though.

112
00:06:25,492 --> 00:06:31,254
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to play more online for Saints Row, but I'm waiting for the patch to come out because it's supposed to be soon.

113
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:38,712
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I saw you online this week, you know, on Xbox, as you can see, and I saw you were playing Bejeweled 2, and I was like, loser.

114
00:06:39,612 --> 00:06:42,193
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because it's Nelly, she keeps playing Bejeweled 2.

115
00:06:42,473 --> 00:06:49,354
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I go to, I went to majornelson.com, and he has like the list of the, you know, the top Xbox games, and now he's doing the arcade games too.

116
00:06:49,754 --> 00:06:54,996
[SPEAKER_03]: And Bejeweled 2 is like number 11, 13, somewhere around there, and I'm like, losers.

117
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:57,296
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

118
00:06:57,356 --> 00:06:59,837
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Bejeweled was cool, like five years ago.

119
00:07:00,914 --> 00:07:01,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Impulse?

120
00:07:01,194 --> 00:07:02,055
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the game she likes.

121
00:07:02,095 --> 00:07:02,635
[SPEAKER_02]: The only game.

122
00:07:02,675 --> 00:07:04,657
[SPEAKER_02]: She was playing Chloe and Clyde though earlier this week too.

123
00:07:04,677 --> 00:07:08,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is impressive because that's like the game that you cannot get those gamer points.

124
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Ever.

125
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,340
[SPEAKER_03]: It's damn impossible.

126
00:07:10,481 --> 00:07:13,202
[SPEAKER_03]: The Bejeweled 2 has the hardest gamer points of any Xbox game I've played.

127
00:07:13,503 --> 00:07:13,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Period.

128
00:07:14,944 --> 00:07:15,364
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get it.

129
00:07:15,424 --> 00:07:16,364
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking at the leaderboards.

130
00:07:16,384 --> 00:07:19,306
[SPEAKER_02]: There was someone that did 250 levels of the main game.

131
00:07:19,326 --> 00:07:20,507
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, how do you even do that?

132
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:21,908
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one hell of a lucky game.

133
00:07:21,988 --> 00:07:22,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheats.

134
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:23,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

135
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,130
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

136
00:07:25,491 --> 00:07:25,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

137
00:07:26,871 --> 00:07:27,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Alrighty.

138
00:07:27,832 --> 00:07:29,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go over to Drew Nami.

139
00:07:29,173 --> 00:07:30,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Drew Nami, how was your gaming week?

140
00:07:31,314 --> 00:07:32,635
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Bejeweled.

141
00:07:34,336 --> 00:07:34,857
[SPEAKER_03]: For real?

142
00:07:35,257 --> 00:07:35,877
[SPEAKER_03]: For real.

143
00:07:36,137 --> 00:07:37,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you a loser?

144
00:07:37,218 --> 00:07:37,699
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm kidding.

145
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:41,381
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to... Look, people play casual games and that's okay.

146
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,722
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, you know... I was bored.

147
00:07:42,882 --> 00:07:49,787
[SPEAKER_03]: If you own an Xbox 360 and the only thing you're playing on it is Bejeweled, something's wrong.

148
00:07:50,327 --> 00:07:52,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Aside from that, I was kicking it semi-old school.

149
00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:57,873
[SPEAKER_01]: I was playing Space Channel 5 and Disgaea and the usual WoW.

150
00:07:57,893 --> 00:07:59,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to be getting the new Disgaea?

151
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:01,035
[SPEAKER_01]: When I have the money.

152
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:05,236
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already out, but I want to finish the original Disgaea first.

153
00:08:05,836 --> 00:08:10,739
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't played the new Disgaea, I've just heard that it's almost just like the first one.

154
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,821
[SPEAKER_03]: It just kind of seamlessly picks up and moves on.

155
00:08:14,021 --> 00:08:14,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Why change a good thing?

156
00:08:15,682 --> 00:08:20,744
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's still Prinny's in it, and apparently there is a cameo of Etna in it.

157
00:08:21,265 --> 00:08:21,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.

158
00:08:23,106 --> 00:08:23,706
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks to be good.

159
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:26,527
[SPEAKER_01]: So anything else besides the wow and the bejeweled?

160
00:08:27,628 --> 00:08:29,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, Space Channel 5.

161
00:08:29,348 --> 00:08:30,109
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, hot.

162
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:31,109
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Space Channel 5.

163
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:33,810
[SPEAKER_01]: Reminds me how much my short-term memory sucks.

164
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,531
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, what were we talking about?

165
00:08:37,151 --> 00:08:38,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Your gaming week?

166
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:38,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, anyway.

167
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:43,013
[SPEAKER_03]: My gaming week, because I forgot, I haven't talked about mine yet.

168
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,474
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't played anything new.

169
00:08:44,574 --> 00:08:48,275
[SPEAKER_03]: There really wasn't a lot new this week I wanted to buy, so it's really most the same stuff.

170
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:50,576
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have any new reviews for you guys this week, just because...

171
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:51,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Ruler Rose Ruler Rose

172
00:09:06,371 --> 00:09:09,675
[SPEAKER_03]: It's being promoted as this Silent Hill-esque kind of game.

173
00:09:10,476 --> 00:09:12,940
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the most part, that would be an accurate way to describe it.

174
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,283
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're into the Silent Hill games, you'll probably like Rule of Rose.

175
00:09:15,803 --> 00:09:23,193
[SPEAKER_03]: It's historically based a little bit, so it kind of takes place in the 20s, and I think it's supposed to be actually based on this old story.

176
00:09:23,433 --> 00:09:24,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there giant crabs?

177
00:09:24,694 --> 00:09:25,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there giant crabs?

178
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,841
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

179
00:10:15,023 --> 00:10:15,643
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

180
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:33,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

181
00:10:52,148 --> 00:10:53,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

182
00:11:07,782 --> 00:11:11,383
[SPEAKER_02]: In Castlevania 3, actually, there's a lot of parts that weren't in the castle.

183
00:11:11,483 --> 00:11:14,104
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Dracula X. Look, shut your mouth.

184
00:11:14,304 --> 00:11:16,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, okay, let's just put it this way.

185
00:11:16,804 --> 00:11:23,506
[SPEAKER_01]: The first Metroidvania where you can legitimately go outside the castle for an extended period of time.

186
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:25,346
[SPEAKER_01]: I like Metroidvania.

187
00:11:25,366 --> 00:11:27,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Weren't we talking about Rule of Rose?

188
00:11:27,127 --> 00:11:30,288
[SPEAKER_03]: How did this turn into Bash Rob's Gamer Cred here somehow?

189
00:11:30,388 --> 00:11:32,428
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always Bash Rob's Gamer Cred.

190
00:11:32,468 --> 00:11:34,009
[SPEAKER_02]: No, only on message boards, sorry.

191
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:35,409
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyways.

192
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,126
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a pretty fun game.

193
00:11:37,246 --> 00:11:37,667
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked it.

194
00:11:37,727 --> 00:11:41,751
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very strange, and I think it's one of those games that you're not going to understand what's going on until the very end.

195
00:11:42,031 --> 00:11:43,953
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you think of having the dog element?

196
00:11:43,973 --> 00:11:47,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's where it really differs from Silent Hill, is that you have this partner.

197
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:53,802
[SPEAKER_03]: About 30 minutes to an hour into the game, you get this partner that helps you, this dog, that will seek out items.

198
00:11:53,822 --> 00:11:55,304
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of adds a real interesting element to the game.

199
00:11:55,644 --> 00:12:14,039
[SPEAKER_02]: It is an interesting element, and to be honest, I didn't realize how important it was because you can actually find a lot of hidden weapons and items that way by searching out different things, and you can get some really super powerful weapons if you actually spend the time to use the dog to find different items that seem useless, but you trade them in for better stuff.

200
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:21,825
[SPEAKER_02]: So the dog is pretty cool, and it also kind of simplifies things because it makes it simple to find where you're supposed to go.

201
00:12:21,845 --> 00:12:23,487
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have the dog sniff out stuff.

202
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:27,950
[SPEAKER_02]: The creatures in it are very creepy, though.

203
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:32,471
[SPEAKER_02]: All these kind of golem or imp kind of characters.

204
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:39,592
[SPEAKER_02]: There's children that have no faces, basically, and they're just kind of, I don't know how to describe them, really.

205
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:40,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Just creepy looking.

206
00:12:40,712 --> 00:12:45,053
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the dog element, we're talking like Silent Hill meets Secret of Evermore?

207
00:12:45,253 --> 00:12:51,895
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's more like Silent Hill meets Haunting Ground.

208
00:12:53,888 --> 00:12:58,171
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the way I'll test if a game is scary or not is I'll make Christopher's sister play it, my roommate.

209
00:12:58,491 --> 00:13:03,595
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll make his sister play it because, like, seriously, this is the girl, and she's not here right now so I can talk a little shit.

210
00:13:04,095 --> 00:13:12,020
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the girl who cried while fighting a Silent Hill 3 boss because she couldn't take it because the boss would run around her and then try to slash her so she started crying.

211
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:12,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Which one was it?

212
00:13:13,462 --> 00:13:14,444
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember the name.

213
00:13:14,884 --> 00:13:15,786
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember the name involved.

214
00:13:15,826 --> 00:13:16,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that on Hill 2?

215
00:13:16,647 --> 00:13:16,888
[SPEAKER_03]: No, on 3.

216
00:13:17,288 --> 00:13:18,190
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm on the rooftop.

217
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

218
00:13:19,312 --> 00:13:20,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yeah.

219
00:13:21,275 --> 00:13:22,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, she cried a lot.

220
00:13:22,818 --> 00:13:25,823
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I want to test if a game is scary or not, I'll make her play it.

221
00:13:25,863 --> 00:13:27,085
[SPEAKER_03]: So I made her play Ruler Rose.

222
00:13:27,441 --> 00:13:27,881
[SPEAKER_03]: And she did.

223
00:13:27,921 --> 00:13:28,501
[SPEAKER_03]: She freaked out.

224
00:13:28,521 --> 00:13:30,302
[SPEAKER_03]: She threw the controller on the ground in a few parts.

225
00:13:30,322 --> 00:13:31,182
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, I'm not going to play!

226
00:13:31,242 --> 00:13:31,762
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to play!

227
00:13:31,802 --> 00:13:32,582
[SPEAKER_03]: And then she picks it up again.

228
00:13:32,882 --> 00:13:35,703
[SPEAKER_03]: So the scare factor is definitely there if you're a big girl.

229
00:13:35,763 --> 00:13:36,623
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, no, no.

230
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:37,383
[SPEAKER_06]: I got that beat.

231
00:13:38,464 --> 00:13:40,384
[SPEAKER_06]: We were playing Fatal Frame.

232
00:13:41,684 --> 00:13:43,345
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my friends and I, we were playing Fatal Frame.

233
00:13:43,705 --> 00:13:49,106
[SPEAKER_06]: I could not even get her to walk the few feet in the fog because I was freaking out.

234
00:13:49,706 --> 00:13:51,307
[SPEAKER_06]: And nothing was happening and I was freaking out.

235
00:13:51,727 --> 00:13:52,367
[SPEAKER_06]: I got that beat.

236
00:13:52,487 --> 00:13:56,168
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Fatal Frame is the one scary series I could not get into for some reason.

237
00:13:56,428 --> 00:13:56,828
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why.

238
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:03,292
[SPEAKER_05]: How many of us that are playing the first Resident Evil freaked out when the dogs crashed through the window?

239
00:14:03,352 --> 00:14:05,413
[SPEAKER_03]: I freaked out at the horrible voiceovers.

240
00:14:07,193 --> 00:14:09,034
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that is not Chris's blood.

241
00:14:09,054 --> 00:14:11,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, my first Resident Evil was 2 for some reason.

242
00:14:11,615 --> 00:14:13,035
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of missed the boat a little bit.

243
00:14:13,135 --> 00:14:13,856
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, sorry.

244
00:14:14,256 --> 00:14:15,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Rulerose, final thoughts on Rulerose.

245
00:14:16,137 --> 00:14:16,977
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like it.

246
00:14:17,717 --> 00:14:22,079
[SPEAKER_02]: It is probably one of the games I've actually played a lot of recently.

247
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,039
[SPEAKER_02]: At least almost all the way through.

248
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:25,560
[SPEAKER_02]: And definitely one that I haven't really

249
00:14:26,578 --> 00:14:30,042
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't really played that many games on the PlayStation 2 lately, so I recommend picking it up.

250
00:14:30,523 --> 00:14:32,485
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing it sucks about is its full price.

251
00:14:32,545 --> 00:14:32,806
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like $49.99.

252
00:14:34,888 --> 00:14:41,376
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're really into those kind of niche horror games, it's going to be pretty good for you.

253
00:14:41,806 --> 00:14:45,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, if you like adventure, horror-type games, Ruler Rose is going to be right up your alley.

254
00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:46,670
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a great soundtrack, too.

255
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,091
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot to say, the soundtrack is phenomenal.

256
00:14:48,111 --> 00:14:49,132
[SPEAKER_02]: The soundtrack is awesome.

257
00:14:49,192 --> 00:14:51,174
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually done by the people that did Panzer Dragoon.

258
00:14:51,254 --> 00:14:52,535
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a phenomenal soundtrack.

259
00:14:52,575 --> 00:14:53,315
[SPEAKER_03]: I was very impressed.

260
00:14:53,556 --> 00:15:05,045
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's even cool about the whole thing is once you're done with the game, if you do look up, if you read on message boards and stuff about the backstory to it, it makes it even creepier, just the whole thing, because it's based on real life.

261
00:15:06,066 --> 00:15:06,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of.

262
00:15:06,486 --> 00:15:07,527
[SPEAKER_02]: It's based on real events.

263
00:15:07,587 --> 00:15:08,067
[SPEAKER_02]: How about that?

264
00:15:08,247 --> 00:15:08,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

265
00:15:09,088 --> 00:15:17,632
[SPEAKER_03]: The gameplay itself I wouldn't call super original and it's a weird entry for sort of what's starting to, you know, we're wrapping down this generation of games.

266
00:15:17,932 --> 00:15:20,313
[SPEAKER_03]: But overall I would recommend it to fans of the genre.

267
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:22,174
[SPEAKER_03]: And the animation in it is really good too.

268
00:15:22,654 --> 00:15:23,994
[SPEAKER_03]: I would recommend it to fans of the genre.

269
00:15:24,014 --> 00:15:24,875
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you guys will be pleased.

270
00:15:25,635 --> 00:15:28,438
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, shall we get into some gaming news tonight then?

271
00:15:28,538 --> 00:15:30,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, first, quick housekeeping before we get into gaming news.

272
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:39,887
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to say, if you missed the announcement on our website, we have relaunched the Dance Dance Revolution sneak peeks, and they start tonight.

273
00:15:40,087 --> 00:15:46,753
[SPEAKER_03]: And the good news is, even though it was delayed a week, good things come to those who wait, it will be a part of the podcast.

274
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:49,215
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to just listen live to hear the songs.

275
00:15:49,554 --> 00:15:50,354
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is amazing.

276
00:15:50,394 --> 00:15:54,136
[SPEAKER_03]: We're really excited to be working with Konami of Hawaii to play some new songs for you.

277
00:15:54,196 --> 00:15:56,297
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get to that shortly after some news.

278
00:15:56,797 --> 00:15:57,918
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what else is amazing?

279
00:15:58,018 --> 00:15:58,218
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

280
00:15:58,358 --> 00:15:59,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, actually, what's not amazing?

281
00:15:59,559 --> 00:15:59,759
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

282
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:00,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Ken Kuragi.

283
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

284
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:02,840
[SPEAKER_03]: What did he do now?

285
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:11,424
[SPEAKER_05]: In the news today, he got a new bicycle helmet because he chewed through his strap on his last one and ended up throwing up crayons all over the place.

286
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:13,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Mac PowerBook

287
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Pro, or whatever it's called.

288
00:16:33,913 --> 00:16:35,754
[SPEAKER_06]: The latest, whatever the most expensive thing is.

289
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:37,636
[SPEAKER_06]: MacBook Pro, whatever the most expensive thing is.

290
00:16:38,216 --> 00:16:45,361
[SPEAKER_06]: And for those of you who like the Sims 2 games on the Mac, go out and get Open for Business.

291
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:53,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Because in the last few games of the Sims 2, it slows, like the computer just lags it to death.

292
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:59,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Like anything, any animation, any huge thing that the game does, it's lagged and stuff like that.

293
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,012
[SPEAKER_06]: And Out to Lunch, they completely take care of that.

294
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:03,913
[SPEAKER_06]: and LightLeanFast.com

295
00:17:24,171 --> 00:17:24,932
[SPEAKER_06]: I like killing puppies.

296
00:17:24,952 --> 00:17:25,593
[SPEAKER_06]: I like killing puppies.

297
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Please no hate mail for the pet lovers.

298
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:52,681
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, no, no.

299
00:17:53,681 --> 00:17:56,242
[SPEAKER_06]: If you kill the pets... Oh, it's a rumor, actually.

300
00:17:56,603 --> 00:18:01,405
[SPEAKER_06]: If you kill the pets, they get a little tombstone, and they walk around as ghosts.

301
00:18:01,585 --> 00:18:02,345
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hilarious.

302
00:18:02,505 --> 00:18:06,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time I hear about dead pets now, I can't help but think about... Madonna!

303
00:18:06,807 --> 00:18:08,447
[SPEAKER_01]: My precious Madonna!

304
00:18:08,627 --> 00:18:09,448
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God.

305
00:18:09,628 --> 00:18:12,669
[SPEAKER_01]: I cheered when that lady got chewed on.

306
00:18:16,738 --> 00:18:18,819
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

307
00:18:47,896 --> 00:19:02,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony has made an official statement saying that they are, to quote, the delay in mass production schedule of the blue laser diode within the Sony group, thus affecting the timely procurement of key components to be utilized in PlayStation 3.

308
00:19:04,011 --> 00:19:09,977
[SPEAKER_05]: So, in Europe, Russia, Middle East, Africa, and Australia, we'll have to wait until March to get a PS3.

309
00:19:10,658 --> 00:19:12,659
[SPEAKER_05]: However, it is on track to launch...

310
00:19:13,604 --> 00:19:17,266
[SPEAKER_05]: in Japan on November 11th, and in North America on November 17th.

311
00:19:17,627 --> 00:19:22,129
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically, by the time you all get it overseas, we're going to tell you how much it sucks already.

312
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:27,573
[SPEAKER_03]: So essentially, Sony just gave Europe the finger this week, essentially.

313
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:31,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Not just Europe, that whole chunk of the world.

314
00:19:31,568 --> 00:19:35,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, but yeah, everything on that side of the ocean pretty much got the shaft.

315
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:42,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Their plan, though, is to still ship 6 million PS3s globally by the end of the 2007 fiscal year.

316
00:19:43,254 --> 00:19:46,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this a surprise, though, that this has been delayed?

317
00:19:46,836 --> 00:19:48,016
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of us saw this coming.

318
00:19:48,136 --> 00:19:49,417
[SPEAKER_05]: The rumors were out before.

319
00:19:50,497 --> 00:19:57,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, before they made the announcement that there was a shortage with their shipment, so...

320
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:16,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm, that's kind of funny, you know, because when you don't, I don't know, start production on a console yet, yeah, it's probably going to be delayed, but it's also, you know, not a surprise since the announcement of the delay that they're going to be limited on the quantities that they're going to have for the other two territories that they're actually launching on time, and that would be both Japan and North America.

321
00:20:16,857 --> 00:20:18,879
[SPEAKER_02]: What's interesting, though, is that the U.S.

322
00:20:18,939 --> 00:20:22,642
[SPEAKER_02]: is getting 400,000 units at launch, and Japan's only getting 100,000.

323
00:20:22,762 --> 00:20:27,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I don't know about you guys, but I figured that Sony, with the

324
00:20:27,722 --> 00:20:35,008
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured that Japan, you know, is pretty rabid Sony fans, and I would have figured they would give them more units than just 100,000, but I don't know.

325
00:20:35,028 --> 00:20:36,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that because of the population difference or something?

326
00:20:36,949 --> 00:20:46,898
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what it is, I think what it is maybe, population difference, also the fact that they have probably a better, they want to have more ground on the U.S.

327
00:20:47,058 --> 00:20:52,122
[SPEAKER_02]: front instead of Japan, because right now, Japan, the 360 isn't doing very well, so.

328
00:20:52,722 --> 00:20:53,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

329
00:20:53,403 --> 00:20:54,103
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah.

330
00:20:56,419 --> 00:20:57,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Is Sony screwed because of this?

331
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,480
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, seriously, guys, I was thinking this week.

332
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:06,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, you know, I didn't buy a PlayStation 2 until it was already out for a year.

333
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:13,063
[SPEAKER_03]: And the PlayStation 1, I didn't even blink an eye at until they started getting some of the games I was really interested in on it.

334
00:21:13,463 --> 00:21:16,084
[SPEAKER_03]: So could the PlayStation 3 simply repeat that?

335
00:21:16,144 --> 00:21:20,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe we're all giving it a hard time because we're all focused on the launch right now.

336
00:21:20,165 --> 00:21:23,466
[SPEAKER_03]: But in a year, could the PlayStation 3 maybe be a good console?

337
00:21:23,686 --> 00:21:27,808
[SPEAKER_02]: To be honest, I mean, what, the 360 launched with almost the same amount of units.

338
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:33,851
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't see that being as big of a deal as the fact that it's $600.

339
00:21:35,172 --> 00:21:43,676
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, right now, like they released their first commercial or kind of mini movies that they're going to be advertising it in the UK with.

340
00:21:44,316 --> 00:21:48,859
[SPEAKER_02]: And their big advertisement is, yeah, the AI in games, guess what?

341
00:21:49,199 --> 00:21:51,140
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just, you know, it's better.

342
00:21:52,424 --> 00:21:53,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Of the 400,000, how many will work?

343
00:22:11,479 --> 00:22:12,600
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

344
00:22:34,783 --> 00:22:43,773
[SPEAKER_02]: So their standalone Blu-ray player is probably going to be delayed because there's no diodes for it, obviously, since they can't even make enough for the PlayStation 3.

345
00:22:44,434 --> 00:22:45,835
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that going to do for Blu-ray?

346
00:22:46,376 --> 00:22:50,400
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the big thing, because if they get enough of those HD DVD players out there...

347
00:22:51,141 --> 00:22:53,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, you know, that might be a problem.

348
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:54,584
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, I don't know.

349
00:22:54,604 --> 00:22:59,589
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they use even the same diodes on the HD DVD players, so... Who knows?

350
00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:06,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Comment from JeremyTodd1 in chat, With such an extreme shortage, I wonder how high prices for the PS3 will get on eBay.

351
00:23:06,214 --> 00:23:07,255
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's the other thing, too.

352
00:23:07,756 --> 00:23:15,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, you know, back in spring when it was supposedly, you know, that PlayStation 3 was going to launch, and, you know, oh yeah, we're on track, we're on track.

353
00:23:16,303 --> 00:23:16,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes or no and why?

354
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:47,272
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because they're going to miss out on their Christmas, and I think that would be death for them.

355
00:23:47,573 --> 00:23:56,000
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to have their console out there, even if it's going to be limited numbers, because if anything, it'll sell out, people will want it because it's sold out, and there you go.

356
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,301
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura?

357
00:23:58,322 --> 00:24:00,724
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty much my assessment on the same thing.

358
00:24:00,764 --> 00:24:04,347
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, people want what they can't have, basically.

359
00:24:05,307 --> 00:24:05,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

360
00:24:05,467 --> 00:24:06,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Dranami?

361
00:24:06,729 --> 00:24:06,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

362
00:24:07,806 --> 00:24:08,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Ditto.

363
00:24:08,267 --> 00:24:12,972
[SPEAKER_01]: The shortage is just going to create more demand, so, you know, why mess up a good marketing strategy?

364
00:24:13,532 --> 00:24:16,796
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though the commercials are much akin to, I don't know, polishing a turd.

365
00:24:16,816 --> 00:24:19,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Chris, should Sony delay?

366
00:24:19,058 --> 00:24:19,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes or no?

367
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:20,700
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

368
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,642
[SPEAKER_06]: They at least need to get the Christmas stuff out there.

369
00:24:22,842 --> 00:24:24,644
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that thought whole market and stuff like that.

370
00:24:24,664 --> 00:24:26,606
[SPEAKER_06]: So pretty much what everyone else said.

371
00:24:27,987 --> 00:24:28,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm going to be brave.

372
00:24:28,827 --> 00:24:29,428
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say yes.

373
00:24:29,608 --> 00:24:37,152
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Sony ought to delay at this point because the games, the lineup games could get stronger for launch because you've seen all these games getting shuffled around the launch window.

374
00:24:37,552 --> 00:24:41,815
[SPEAKER_03]: They would still get the console out by the end of their fiscal year and they could have a stronger launch.

375
00:24:41,955 --> 00:24:44,256
[SPEAKER_03]: I think people are going to buy these systems Christmas or not.

376
00:24:44,576 --> 00:24:47,578
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the same people are going to buy the systems no matter what time of year you launch.

377
00:24:47,898 --> 00:24:56,263
[SPEAKER_03]: I realize there's this huge thing to want to get the spoiled kids around Christmas, but those spoiled kids will find an excuse to get their systems in April or March if they want to release them.

378
00:24:56,283 --> 00:24:56,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on a sec.

379
00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:12,165
[SPEAKER_01]: What I think is, why would developers be so brave as to dev new games after the launch titles if the system hasn't been sold yet and the launch titles haven't caught on and so the PS3 hasn't caught on?

380
00:25:12,606 --> 00:25:14,867
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's going to be brave enough to dev games for that?

381
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:17,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

382
00:25:17,668 --> 00:25:19,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting thoughts from chat as well.

383
00:25:19,369 --> 00:25:26,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeremy Tom 1 says, the huge problem with this though is that a few people will get a PS3 and then their friends will see it and they might decide that the graphics aren't much different from the 360 and

384
00:25:27,554 --> 00:25:28,334
[SPEAKER_03]: and they'll go buy a 360 instead.

385
00:25:48,345 --> 00:25:49,626
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

386
00:26:17,968 --> 00:26:20,130
[SPEAKER_05]: The system is only as good as the games that are on it.

387
00:26:34,918 --> 00:26:35,819
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

388
00:26:36,339 --> 00:26:44,043
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, I don't have a lot of money to drop on a game system if there's not going to be a game that I want.

389
00:26:44,423 --> 00:26:51,507
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a very big Disney fan, so I bought a PS2 for the sole purpose of playing Kingdom Hearts.

390
00:26:51,587 --> 00:26:58,170
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've discovered other games that I like about it, but unless they make a game that I want, I'm not going to drop that much money on it.

391
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,471
[SPEAKER_06]: The Wii does look interesting, though.

392
00:26:59,998 --> 00:27:03,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Megsies in chat and says there's no reason to get a PS3 at launch.

393
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:05,985
[SPEAKER_03]: The only exclusive games worth getting will be out in 2007-2008.

394
00:27:06,265 --> 00:27:09,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Metal Gear Solid 4, Final Fantasy 13, and so on.

395
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:12,292
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of how I felt about the PlayStation 2, to be honest.

396
00:27:12,372 --> 00:27:13,874
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, what was I going to buy at launch?

397
00:27:13,934 --> 00:27:14,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Fantavision?

398
00:27:14,554 --> 00:27:15,956
[SPEAKER_03]: There is some good games.

399
00:27:15,976 --> 00:27:17,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Fantavision was sort of fun.

400
00:27:18,198 --> 00:27:19,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it like Lair?

401
00:27:19,479 --> 00:27:20,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it Miklatov or Jamie in here?

402
00:27:20,999 --> 00:27:21,459
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.

403
00:27:21,479 --> 00:27:22,600
[SPEAKER_02]: It was sort of fun.

404
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,062
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say there are some good first party games, or exclusive games I should say.

405
00:27:27,262 --> 00:27:30,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Lair and Resistance Fall of Man look pretty good.

406
00:27:31,303 --> 00:27:38,386
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, you know, I haven't seen them in... I think after Tokyo Game Show we'll get a better gauge of how good the games are going to be.

407
00:27:39,227 --> 00:27:45,689
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to have to start marketing this thing pretty soon because convincing someone why they need to buy a $600 console is going to be

408
00:27:48,393 --> 00:27:51,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty difficult, so we'll have to wait and see.

409
00:27:51,895 --> 00:27:53,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, moving on.

410
00:27:53,476 --> 00:27:58,980
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that will be available around the PS3 launch, you know, if you can't afford a PlayStation 3, which most of us can't.

411
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,921
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, you know what, Europe?

412
00:28:01,402 --> 00:28:02,222
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do you a favor.

413
00:28:02,423 --> 00:28:07,106
[SPEAKER_03]: I am not going to buy a PlayStation 3 until you guys are able to buy PlayStation 3s.

414
00:28:07,426 --> 00:28:08,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is easy, because I wasn't going to get one anyway.

415
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:11,969
[SPEAKER_03]: But we can call this a protest now.

416
00:28:12,009 --> 00:28:13,290
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes it really easy, so...

417
00:28:15,129 --> 00:28:18,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, Europe, I don't think you guys are missing much.

418
00:28:18,431 --> 00:28:19,392
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's kind of how I feel.

419
00:28:19,492 --> 00:28:20,713
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want one of these at launch.

420
00:28:20,753 --> 00:28:29,199
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I guess maybe I feel bad for the person who really, really does in Europe that can't have one now, but... Well, you know what?

421
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:31,221
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, couldn't they just import?

422
00:28:32,021 --> 00:28:41,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, I mean, granted... Because the games are supposed to be region-free, and... We haven't really had super final confirmation on that, though.

423
00:28:41,048 --> 00:28:41,908
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that could have changed.

424
00:28:42,228 --> 00:28:42,669
[SPEAKER_05]: However...

425
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:54,576
[SPEAKER_05]: There's still the, unless, somebody's just going to say, you know, give a big F you to format, because you still have the difference between NTSC and PAL.

426
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:56,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's a good point.

427
00:28:56,938 --> 00:29:00,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless they're just going to say, screw all you, it's high definition or NTSC only.

428
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,801
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think that's right.

429
00:29:02,821 --> 00:29:03,481
[SPEAKER_03]: That would really be murder.

430
00:29:03,501 --> 00:29:07,704
[SPEAKER_05]: That would really put aside a large market of business.

431
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:10,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, anyway, sorry, I got off on a tangent.

432
00:29:10,407 --> 00:29:17,591
[SPEAKER_03]: I meant to say that something that will be available when the PlayStation 3 launches in November is the PSP download service.

433
00:29:18,311 --> 00:29:23,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Original PlayStation games will be downloadable, and the PSP has no problem running them via an emulator.

434
00:29:23,413 --> 00:29:28,056
[SPEAKER_03]: This is all coming from Sony's head of platform development in Japan, Izumi Kawanishi.

435
00:29:28,996 --> 00:29:35,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Kawanishi is also saying that the PSP download service will have movies as well as full original PlayStation games.

436
00:29:35,526 --> 00:29:38,027
[SPEAKER_03]: And it will launch at the same time as the PlayStation 3.

437
00:29:39,468 --> 00:29:40,188
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's about it.

438
00:29:40,208 --> 00:29:40,768
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all they said.

439
00:29:41,128 --> 00:29:43,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you can't download retail movies yet.

440
00:29:43,829 --> 00:29:47,051
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get, you know, like vodcasts and things using little hacks.

441
00:29:47,431 --> 00:29:51,612
[SPEAKER_03]: But Sony has yet to really support full-blown movies.

442
00:29:51,992 --> 00:29:55,114
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, obviously they're going to be releasing the digital rights management and all this stuff.

443
00:29:55,134 --> 00:29:57,975
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess trying to salvage some of what they've lost on UMD.

444
00:29:58,115 --> 00:29:58,455
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

445
00:29:59,244 --> 00:29:59,945
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

446
00:30:19,793 --> 00:30:20,933
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the secret, Sony.

447
00:30:20,993 --> 00:30:23,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Just put out the UMDs and sell them a little cheaper than what you're doing.

448
00:30:24,074 --> 00:30:29,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Make them cheaper than DVDs, and I think they'll be a lot more appealing to a lot of people very quick.

449
00:30:29,475 --> 00:30:30,435
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll sell PSPs.

450
00:30:31,075 --> 00:30:32,776
[SPEAKER_03]: But what do I know?

451
00:30:32,796 --> 00:30:34,176
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just some schmo on the internet.

452
00:30:34,456 --> 00:30:34,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

453
00:30:35,636 --> 00:30:37,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I didn't want to say exactly, but anyways.

454
00:30:38,797 --> 00:30:43,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Some other things that are possibly in the works right now would be a Sony PlayStation phone.

455
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:44,858
[SPEAKER_02]: And...

456
00:30:47,363 --> 00:30:54,348
[SPEAKER_02]: When I saw this, I was thinking, oh god, please not another N-Gage, because that's just horrible.

457
00:30:54,768 --> 00:31:11,080
[SPEAKER_02]: But, apparently, according to Sony Ericsson's Senior Vice President of Product and Application Planning, Riko Sakaguchi, the company is working on something related to the PlayStation phone, and says the surprise...

458
00:31:11,983 --> 00:31:12,444
[SPEAKER_02]: VoiceOverIP

459
00:31:35,903 --> 00:31:36,824
[SPEAKER_05]: The phone station.

460
00:31:37,044 --> 00:31:41,647
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what I like about the PSP a lot is that it really is kind of this all-in-one system.

461
00:31:41,707 --> 00:31:43,769
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of is the leg up that it has on the DS.

462
00:31:43,829 --> 00:31:54,156
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like the DS, while it has a lot of solid games that are innovative, it's kind of having to catch up in the department of having a web browser, playing MP3s, and all this other stuff that a PSP does.

463
00:31:54,196 --> 00:31:54,616
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

464
00:31:55,362 --> 00:32:00,246
[SPEAKER_05]: But wouldn't you rather have a system that you know is going to play a good game?

465
00:32:00,606 --> 00:32:02,227
[SPEAKER_05]: That you know they put effort into?

466
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:07,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what if I'm more of the casual gamer who maybe that's not my biggest focus on the system?

467
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:11,313
[SPEAKER_05]: DS sales are still kicking PSP.

468
00:32:11,694 --> 00:32:12,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me wrong.

469
00:32:13,575 --> 00:32:16,637
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting, all these things that kind of distinguish the PSP a little bit.

470
00:32:16,997 --> 00:32:23,282
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're all cool, but the market is showing people aren't interested in all that as much as they are in just having good games.

471
00:32:24,723 --> 00:32:24,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

472
00:32:27,201 --> 00:32:33,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, speaking of good games, there is something coming on to PSP that I will definitely be all over.

473
00:32:35,425 --> 00:32:37,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Parappa the Rapper is coming on to PSP.

474
00:32:39,807 --> 00:32:41,487
[SPEAKER_03]: In the rain or in the snow?

475
00:32:42,468 --> 00:32:43,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Got the funky, funky float.

476
00:32:44,488 --> 00:32:45,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Crack, butter.

477
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:49,371
[SPEAKER_05]: No, don't even get me started on TV.

478
00:32:49,391 --> 00:32:51,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Check and turn and signal to the left.

479
00:32:51,351 --> 00:32:52,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, love Parappa, love it.

480
00:32:54,868 --> 00:33:01,631
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not really an official announcement yet, but the game was recently featured in Famitsu.

481
00:33:03,492 --> 00:33:10,815
[SPEAKER_05]: So the talk is that we are pretty much going to be getting a proper, and actually that makes sense because they did Guitar Room Man.

482
00:33:11,767 --> 00:33:17,248
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're starting to put out a bit more music and, you know, slash quirky games on the PSP.

483
00:33:17,369 --> 00:33:19,389
[SPEAKER_05]: So, my hope is that this does come to pass.

484
00:33:19,489 --> 00:33:22,830
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this isn't just a port of the PS1 thing on the download service.

485
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:24,570
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like a whole new frickin' thing.

486
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:25,591
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the rumor.

487
00:33:26,011 --> 00:33:27,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, that would be hot.

488
00:33:27,051 --> 00:33:28,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Parappa kind of disappeared for a while.

489
00:33:28,932 --> 00:33:32,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, Parappa the Rapper 2 wasn't quite as good as 1, at least commercially.

490
00:33:32,853 --> 00:33:33,653
[SPEAKER_05]: We need an own Jammer Lamy.

491
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:34,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.

492
00:33:34,773 --> 00:33:36,073
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to bring this series back.

493
00:33:36,113 --> 00:33:36,754
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be awesome.

494
00:33:37,394 --> 00:33:37,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Well...

495
00:33:39,131 --> 00:33:41,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Parappa is not the only thing rumored to be coming back for the PSP.

496
00:33:42,333 --> 00:33:51,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Electronic Arts has confirmed that they are doing an EA Replay collection, and this will be a budget series of adventures for those folks that would be interested in this.

497
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Get this, the types of games that are going to be in the EA Replay.

498
00:33:54,262 --> 00:34:06,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Syndicate, Ultima 7, The Black Gate, Road Rash 1 through 3, Wing Commander, and some other interesting titles such as Desert Strike, Jungle Strike, Virtual Pinball, Mutant League Football.

499
00:34:07,208 --> 00:34:08,869
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be very interesting.

500
00:34:09,249 --> 00:34:12,991
[SPEAKER_03]: But they haven't said anything about that they're going to upgrade the graphics.

501
00:34:13,031 --> 00:34:15,392
[SPEAKER_03]: These may just be straight up ports, but still there's something...

502
00:34:15,892 --> 00:34:18,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Oddly appealing about being able to play Wing Commander on the go.

503
00:34:18,113 --> 00:34:22,154
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they were supposed to be ports of the Super Nintendo and Genesis versions.

504
00:34:22,314 --> 00:34:23,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that would be a crap.

505
00:34:23,474 --> 00:34:25,695
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's just a port of the Genesis, forget it.

506
00:34:26,675 --> 00:34:27,695
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about the PC one.

507
00:34:27,715 --> 00:34:29,076
[SPEAKER_03]: But Ultima 7 wasn't on PC.

508
00:34:29,916 --> 00:34:33,837
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean... Whoops, Ultima 7 was only on PC, wasn't it?

509
00:34:34,277 --> 00:34:36,938
[SPEAKER_03]: They ported 6 to Super Nintendo.

510
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:37,558
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't do 7.

511
00:34:37,678 --> 00:34:38,998
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't port 7.

512
00:34:39,939 --> 00:34:41,579
[SPEAKER_03]: So there must be some PC things involved.

513
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:42,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows.

514
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:43,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways...

515
00:34:45,114 --> 00:34:45,774
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

516
00:35:07,277 --> 00:35:09,558
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have a really hard time believing that it's cancelled on 360.

517
00:35:10,598 --> 00:35:15,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing as they've already kind of worked on Chromehounds.

518
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:20,420
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, it's supposed to be coming out in spring of next year.

519
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:27,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet another reason why waiting until March maybe isn't such a bad idea for the PlayStation 3.

520
00:35:29,282 --> 00:35:34,703
[SPEAKER_05]: In regards to other games and the PlayStation 3, Enchanted Arms is actually going to be out on the PlayStation 3.

521
00:35:39,308 --> 00:35:40,489
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how I feel about that.

522
00:35:40,569 --> 00:35:41,649
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I picked up Enchanted Arms.

523
00:35:41,689 --> 00:35:42,490
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't played it yet.

524
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:43,770
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you're going to enjoy it.

525
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:44,450
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you'll enjoy it.

526
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:49,832
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had a lot of good... You know, it took me a while to get into the game, but it's really good.

527
00:35:50,092 --> 00:35:58,255
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not the best RPG I've ever played, but it's a very good first next-gen experience for RPGs.

528
00:35:58,536 --> 00:36:07,599
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just thinking it was good to have such a solid... You know, apparently a solid game on the 360, and just that it's coming out on the PlayStation 3, just sort of like... No.

529
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:07,659
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

530
00:36:08,924 --> 00:36:09,925
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like it's a little late.

531
00:36:10,425 --> 00:36:14,889
[SPEAKER_03]: By the time it comes out for the PlayStation 3, it'll be like, oh, well, next-gen RPGs are going to be old news.

532
00:36:15,229 --> 00:36:16,750
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it depends when it comes out.

533
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:20,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if Enchanted Arms is coming out at launch, well, that might not be a bad thing.

534
00:36:20,653 --> 00:36:25,696
[SPEAKER_03]: That could be pretty good for Sony, but it doesn't seem like it would be out in time for launch if it's just now being announced.

535
00:36:26,277 --> 00:36:26,557
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

536
00:36:26,897 --> 00:36:28,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah, probably not.

537
00:36:28,598 --> 00:36:31,200
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they already have Oblivion coming out, so that's pretty good.

538
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:31,841
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

539
00:36:32,101 --> 00:36:35,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe if they could redo all the voiceovers, then it wouldn't be so bad.

540
00:36:35,884 --> 00:36:36,444
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they would.

541
00:36:36,829 --> 00:36:37,550
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they would.

542
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,510
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be just a port.

543
00:36:39,511 --> 00:36:40,292
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they would either.

544
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:45,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, one other thing you're going to be missing out on on the PlayStation 3 rumors now is that

545
00:36:46,961 --> 00:36:51,183
[SPEAKER_03]: 1080p is actually not really going to be used in games as much as you think.

546
00:36:51,784 --> 00:37:00,208
[SPEAKER_03]: According to Sony, the official US PlayStation 3 site says that the HDMI connection is required for 1080p signals in Blu-ray movies.

547
00:37:00,908 --> 00:37:07,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony's made an issue of pointing out that 1080p, which the Xbox 360 is incapable of, is the holy grail of full HD.

548
00:37:07,811 --> 00:37:11,193
[SPEAKER_03]: The only game that's running in 1080p, though, is Gran Turismo HD.

549
00:37:11,273 --> 00:37:13,154
[SPEAKER_03]: This was just a tech demo that was created

550
00:37:13,554 --> 00:37:15,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really a full game that's running yet.

551
00:37:43,621 --> 00:37:49,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe this is something that would be more at the PlayStation 3's end of cycle, that you'd start seeing more 1080p games.

552
00:37:50,069 --> 00:37:58,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Like how on Xbox, the first Xbox, before the 360, you started seeing in the end some games start to come out in high def towards the end.

553
00:37:58,941 --> 00:38:01,925
[SPEAKER_03]: And in widescreen especially, you started seeing a lot more widescreen games on Xbox.

554
00:38:02,247 --> 00:38:03,408
[SPEAKER_03]: and then you start to see like burnout.

555
00:38:03,428 --> 00:38:05,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't one of the burnouts towards the end in 720p?

556
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:05,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

557
00:38:06,371 --> 00:38:10,716
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe 1080p is just something that will be more utilized later down the road.

558
00:38:10,796 --> 00:38:17,863
[SPEAKER_02]: But wait, are you guys seeing that Sony was lying when they said that they can do 1080p at 120 frames per second?

559
00:38:17,943 --> 00:38:18,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in one game.

560
00:38:20,546 --> 00:38:21,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking retarded.

561
00:38:22,355 --> 00:38:26,837
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why we trust them with any comments anymore, but whatever.

562
00:38:26,917 --> 00:38:30,579
[SPEAKER_02]: So, okay, so your games are not going to be 1080p.

563
00:38:30,779 --> 00:38:32,980
[SPEAKER_02]: 1080i is pretty good anyways.

564
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:38,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, one thing that's kind of being debated right now is load times.

565
00:38:38,363 --> 00:38:43,185
[SPEAKER_02]: And as anyone remembers on the PlayStation stuff, load times can be quite long.

566
00:38:43,735 --> 00:38:55,459
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're actually saying that because of the Blu-ray drive being a first generation drive, it is going to be slower than the actual DVD drive in the Xbox 360.

567
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:06,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the Blu-ray drive is actually going to be a 1.5 speed drive and transfers at about 54 megabits a second.

568
00:39:07,143 --> 00:39:11,065
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said that their PlayStation 3 is actually a

569
00:39:12,813 --> 00:39:13,193
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on.

570
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:41,162
[SPEAKER_02]: with a hard drive in mind so you're going to be able to cache a lot of stuff to your hard drive I would think.

571
00:39:42,042 --> 00:39:55,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas the one big thing with the 360 I remember because of the core and premium bundles is they weren't sure if the hard drive was going to be there and so they couldn't really take that into account and cache the information to it.

572
00:39:56,388 --> 00:39:59,169
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess now more of the games are using the hard drive.

573
00:39:59,349 --> 00:40:00,970
[SPEAKER_02]: But that might be something that might speed it up.

574
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:03,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever, it's load times.

575
00:40:04,349 --> 00:40:07,550
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want your 1080p games at 120 frames per second, you're going to have to wait.

576
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:11,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, I think you said it with load times.

577
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:14,351
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't care what the speed is of the thing inside the system.

578
00:40:14,391 --> 00:40:19,272
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about the load time and how good the system is at caching and all that stuff.

579
00:40:19,572 --> 00:40:21,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Though, you know, I get it.

580
00:40:21,092 --> 00:40:24,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Logic dictates that you have a slow drive in the thing, you're going to have longer load times.

581
00:40:24,153 --> 00:40:24,473
[SPEAKER_03]: I get it.

582
00:40:24,533 --> 00:40:29,474
[SPEAKER_03]: But if there's some other way Sony can get around that and the developers, then I don't think it'll be the end of the world.

583
00:40:30,214 --> 00:40:30,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

584
00:40:30,994 --> 00:40:31,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

585
00:40:32,168 --> 00:40:37,294
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, let's go over to a realm that we don't get into often enough here on this program.

586
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:40,478
[SPEAKER_03]: That's PC gaming, and we have a few PC gaming stories for you guys tonight.

587
00:40:40,945 --> 00:40:46,789
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to start off with something on Second Life, which is this thing I keep hearing about, but honestly I've never really had a chance to get into and play.

588
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Drew Nami, you play Second Life?

589
00:40:50,192 --> 00:40:51,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me a little bit about what Second Life's all about.

590
00:40:52,553 --> 00:40:55,055
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like a virtual community.

591
00:40:55,255 --> 00:40:56,256
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, it is a virtual community.

592
00:40:56,276 --> 00:41:02,721
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've ever played, say, Sims Online or There or anything like that, it's this virtual world.

593
00:41:02,761 --> 00:41:03,761
[SPEAKER_01]: You have your avatar.

594
00:41:03,802 --> 00:41:05,122
[SPEAKER_01]: You can customize the avatar.

595
00:41:06,003 --> 00:41:07,224
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a lot of communities in there.

596
00:41:07,244 --> 00:41:09,886
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fairly technical if you want to code your own stuff.

597
00:41:10,114 --> 00:41:11,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Have sex in weird positions.

598
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:13,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Things that may not be physically possible in real life.

599
00:41:37,462 --> 00:41:39,144
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, it is possible.

600
00:41:39,444 --> 00:41:42,047
[SPEAKER_01]: Number two, unfortunately, I've seen it done.

601
00:41:43,248 --> 00:41:50,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Or in the case of this picture I'm looking at here, I'm not sure if this is from Second Life or what, but it looks like you have furries banding together there in Second Life.

602
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:54,720
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's actually a pretty active furry community within Second Life.

603
00:41:57,006 --> 00:42:02,249
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not, whatever you're into, I'm not gonna, you know, just, you know, don't touch me with your paws.

604
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:14,337
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, the reason why I bring this up, I got in the news this week that hackers broke into Second Life on Thursday and it was noted on the blog of the parent company to Second Life, Linden Labs.

605
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:22,944
[SPEAKER_03]: The intruders got access to the account names, real life names, contact information, encrypted account passwords, and encrypted payment information.

606
00:42:23,404 --> 00:42:36,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, these types of violations of security sadly aren't that uncommon when you think about it happens in the Amazon type market, but not saying that site specifically, but those type of markets online all the time.

607
00:42:37,316 --> 00:42:40,639
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is really the first, or at least one of the most notable

608
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,523
[SPEAKER_03]: We still get pissed off in MMOs over gold sellers.

609
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:04,330
[SPEAKER_03]: True.

610
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:05,190
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do you think about this?

611
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:09,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Being a Second Life player, what do you think about the fact that your information may have been compromised?

612
00:43:09,411 --> 00:43:19,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for me personally, I don't put anything up on there that I wouldn't be embarrassed to have public, but net result what pissed me off is I had to reset my damn password.

613
00:43:19,713 --> 00:43:21,753
[SPEAKER_01]: They invalidated everyone's passwords.

614
00:43:22,773 --> 00:43:23,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, interesting.

615
00:43:23,873 --> 00:43:26,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well, at least they were pretty quick to get in there and try to fix things.

616
00:43:26,694 --> 00:43:27,074
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.

617
00:43:27,854 --> 00:43:29,874
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think they got it done in like a matter of hours.

618
00:43:30,535 --> 00:43:30,955
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well.

619
00:43:31,255 --> 00:43:32,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty quick on Linden Labs.

620
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:37,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Good for them for being right on it and remedying the situation.

621
00:43:38,001 --> 00:43:43,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, guess what is not being remedied?

622
00:43:43,763 --> 00:43:44,183
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

623
00:43:44,463 --> 00:43:45,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, not really.

624
00:43:45,203 --> 00:43:49,524
[SPEAKER_05]: You remember how everyone was all like, yeah, Spore is going to be all over the place, right?

625
00:43:49,944 --> 00:43:52,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, like DS and PSP and all that stuff?

626
00:43:52,885 --> 00:43:53,045
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

627
00:43:54,405 --> 00:43:54,746
[SPEAKER_03]: No?

628
00:43:55,106 --> 00:43:56,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Like no console versions at all?

629
00:43:56,946 --> 00:43:58,687
[SPEAKER_05]: It's PC only for now.

630
00:43:59,567 --> 00:44:00,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

631
00:44:01,565 --> 00:44:14,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, and this is the quote from EA, although we're investigating the possibilities of bringing this franchise to other platforms in the future, any announcements or confirmations for the Wii or any other platform would be premature.

632
00:44:15,538 --> 00:44:24,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this might be because I think I remember reading another story earlier this week about how I think they were saying something about Spore on the Wii was going to be able to download to the DS and you could edit your creatures on the go.

633
00:44:25,697 --> 00:44:30,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they're saying right now they're 100% focused on finishing Spore for PC and PC only.

634
00:44:31,222 --> 00:44:31,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

635
00:44:31,762 --> 00:44:33,584
[SPEAKER_05]: As that's the official word.

636
00:44:34,524 --> 00:44:42,271
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes sense, but we all know it's going to go like The Sims, where The Sims was on PC first and then you had five gazillion different versions on all the consoles just later on.

637
00:44:42,331 --> 00:44:42,811
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll spread.

638
00:44:43,052 --> 00:44:43,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

639
00:44:43,332 --> 00:44:46,394
[SPEAKER_05]: But for now, I think it's actually good that they are focusing only on PC.

640
00:44:46,815 --> 00:44:52,099
[SPEAKER_05]: That way they can bring out a quality product to get the buzz going and then from their work on the other versions.

641
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,020
Hmm.

642
00:44:53,806 --> 00:44:56,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Now OL Army Eddie in our chatroom says, EA lies.

643
00:44:57,569 --> 00:44:57,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Lies.

644
00:44:58,430 --> 00:44:59,091
[SPEAKER_05]: They all lie.

645
00:44:59,551 --> 00:44:59,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

646
00:45:00,172 --> 00:45:09,480
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, also following up on the Second Life information, Tiger Claw in our chat says, also note that the credit card information was on another server and that wasn't compromised.

647
00:45:10,101 --> 00:45:10,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

648
00:45:11,322 --> 00:45:11,682
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.

649
00:45:12,383 --> 00:45:16,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, if you're really into sim stuff, you might be interested in this.

650
00:45:16,166 --> 00:45:17,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

651
00:45:17,731 --> 00:45:19,212
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this doesn't have to do with the Sims.

652
00:45:20,272 --> 00:45:21,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Some other gaming series.

653
00:45:22,073 --> 00:45:28,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Sid Meier's, they're releasing a wonderful collection, which is going to be coming to stores pretty soon here.

654
00:45:29,337 --> 00:45:39,723
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be including quite a few different games, including Civilization 1, Civ 2, Civ 2 Fantastic Worlds, Civ 2 Conflicts in Civilization,

655
00:45:40,283 --> 00:45:48,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Civ 2, Tests of Time, Civ 3, Civ 3, Play the World, and Civ 3, Conquest, and finally Civ 4.

656
00:45:49,469 --> 00:45:51,491
[SPEAKER_02]: A whole bunch of Civilization for you.

657
00:45:51,751 --> 00:45:54,933
[SPEAKER_03]: But to be honest, if you're a Civilization fan, you probably have all that shit already.

658
00:45:55,133 --> 00:46:13,767
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, is there anything special that doesn't, you know... Well, you get a Civilization card game, a 96-page book of artwork, and a DVD featuring lead designer Soren Johnson and artist Dorian Newcomb talking about the creation of Civ IV.

659
00:46:14,167 --> 00:46:23,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I really can't bash this too much, because I've said it on this show before, Civilization, the original, the first one that ever came out on the PC, is hands down my favorite PC game ever.

660
00:46:24,171 --> 00:46:24,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Ever.

661
00:46:24,631 --> 00:46:26,192
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the original Civilization.

662
00:46:26,932 --> 00:46:31,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't ask me, I can't get into Civ 2, 3, the same, I haven't tried 4 yet, I really want to.

663
00:46:32,034 --> 00:46:34,255
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't get into 2 and 3 the same way I can the original.

664
00:46:34,295 --> 00:46:35,216
[SPEAKER_03]: What were you doing this for?

665
00:46:35,456 --> 00:46:37,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you saying I'm too stupid to get 2 and 3?

666
00:46:37,096 --> 00:46:40,878
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm saying the entirety of Civ goes right over my head.

667
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:40,938
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.

668
00:46:42,355 --> 00:46:46,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, I don't know if... There's got to be a way you can get Civilization 1 really cheap now.

669
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:48,481
[SPEAKER_03]: I highly urge you guys to check it out.

670
00:46:48,821 --> 00:46:50,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Civ 2 is not bad either, really.

671
00:46:50,342 --> 00:46:51,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not bad.

672
00:46:51,123 --> 00:46:52,364
[SPEAKER_03]: I just didn't enjoy it as much as 1.

673
00:46:53,025 --> 00:46:54,806
[SPEAKER_03]: So, seriously, check these games out.

674
00:46:55,127 --> 00:46:57,729
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great, great landmark game in PC history.

675
00:46:57,809 --> 00:46:59,070
[SPEAKER_03]: I absolutely love Civ 1.

676
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:01,092
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to play Civ Net back in the day.

677
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:07,718
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I have to admit, actually something like this, to me, who hasn't followed the Civ series for a long time, this almost sounds appealing.

678
00:47:08,542 --> 00:47:08,762
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

679
00:47:28,733 --> 00:47:30,134
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't rolling my eyes.

680
00:47:30,455 --> 00:47:36,400
[SPEAKER_03]: And the queen nerd, DarkSakura, is here to read those emails for you every week.

681
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,661
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the queen nerd, you're the king dork.

682
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:47,249
[SPEAKER_03]: So suit up the rubber gloves and asbestos suit and tell us who's emailed us at mailbag at orangenontrader.com this week.

683
00:47:47,729 --> 00:47:51,232
[SPEAKER_05]: I do want to go ahead and actually repeat the ages old disclaimer.

684
00:47:51,732 --> 00:47:53,554
[SPEAKER_05]: If you send us hate mail, all we're going to do is laugh at you.

685
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:56,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so we had a couple ha-ha's this week, which was great.

686
00:47:56,975 --> 00:47:57,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the hate mail.

687
00:47:57,915 --> 00:47:59,836
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the most ridiculous thing I've ever read.

688
00:47:59,956 --> 00:48:03,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so... Actually, we need more, because I didn't laugh enough this week.

689
00:48:03,378 --> 00:48:04,898
[SPEAKER_03]: So please send us more hate mail, actually.

690
00:48:05,478 --> 00:48:06,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Chris, send us hate mail.

691
00:48:06,439 --> 00:48:07,799
[SPEAKER_05]: And hate mail means you were listening.

692
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:10,320
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for downloading our podcast.

693
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:10,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

694
00:48:12,001 --> 00:48:13,642
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's funny about that hate mail that I read?

695
00:48:13,762 --> 00:48:16,783
[SPEAKER_03]: It's obvious that the people were listening to the show regularly.

696
00:48:17,163 --> 00:48:18,203
[SPEAKER_03]: So, hey, cool.

697
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:20,924
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't see the one that was towards you.

698
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:21,665
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter.

699
00:48:21,685 --> 00:48:22,365
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter.

700
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:29,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, we got one that is not crap from Renee.

701
00:48:31,165 --> 00:48:31,805
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it's Renee?

702
00:48:31,946 --> 00:48:32,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

703
00:48:33,026 --> 00:48:37,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, Jamie, Skye, and Loki, but mostly Jamie as you're the only one who mostly reads these emails.

704
00:48:37,769 --> 00:48:46,875
[SPEAKER_05]: I was looking through the PEGI Pan-European Game Information website, which is a video game rating board, reported that video games are actually good for you.

705
00:48:47,015 --> 00:48:47,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Here is a link.

706
00:48:47,736 --> 00:48:48,836
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an old article, July 12, 2006.

707
00:48:50,441 --> 00:48:53,143
[SPEAKER_05]: But at least we know that Europe loves video games.

708
00:48:55,444 --> 00:48:59,266
[SPEAKER_05]: It's sort of a long URL, but I'll just go over some highlights.

709
00:49:00,407 --> 00:49:13,334
[SPEAKER_05]: It was about a meeting that was in Brussels on July 6, 2006 that had the consumers, publishers, developers of video games in the European Union involved in this.

710
00:49:13,394 --> 00:49:19,217
[SPEAKER_05]: They were including parent representatives, panels of experts, psychologists, media specialists,

711
00:49:19,815 --> 00:49:23,698
[SPEAKER_05]: who were just discussing the whole thing from what I was reading in this article.

712
00:49:27,761 --> 00:49:29,842
[SPEAKER_05]: There's actually a quote in here that I liked.

713
00:49:29,902 --> 00:49:36,627
[SPEAKER_05]: In light of such a thorough analysis of current issues and such a lively dialogue, we should not let this intellectual stimulation die out.

714
00:49:37,288 --> 00:49:41,951
[SPEAKER_05]: ISFE will see to building upon this exchange and make it happen on a permanent and regular basis.

715
00:49:42,511 --> 00:49:48,556
[SPEAKER_05]: But as they were going through, they were just reviewing the different perceptions based on all sides of the issue

716
00:49:49,396 --> 00:50:00,959
[SPEAKER_05]: and that it was coming through that basically the games have innovative effects on, you know, you can use them for education, treatment of behavior problems, attention deficit disorder.

717
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:03,419
[SPEAKER_05]: They're even going into manned space exploration.

718
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,921
[SPEAKER_05]: There's all kinds of different applications that video games themselves apply to.

719
00:50:08,001 --> 00:50:14,202
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if our army's using them, then there's got to be something there, right?

720
00:50:14,802 --> 00:50:16,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, you should post that link for the chat room.

721
00:50:16,223 --> 00:50:17,483
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet they'd get a kick out of that article.

722
00:50:17,683 --> 00:50:17,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I...

723
00:50:18,294 --> 00:50:19,894
[SPEAKER_05]: I accidentally closed it.

724
00:50:20,495 --> 00:50:26,896
[SPEAKER_06]: Where the hell was that kind of information when my parents wouldn't let me get a game system when I was in high school?

725
00:50:28,216 --> 00:50:29,357
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm posting in the chat room right now.

726
00:50:29,797 --> 00:50:30,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

727
00:50:31,917 --> 00:50:33,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Videos don't rot your brain.

728
00:50:33,798 --> 00:50:34,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

729
00:50:35,858 --> 00:50:39,079
[SPEAKER_05]: The television does, and then the aliens suck your face off just like in that episode of Doctor Who.

730
00:50:39,099 --> 00:50:40,179
[SPEAKER_03]: But you play video games on the television.

731
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:42,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

732
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:45,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

733
00:50:48,032 --> 00:50:49,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, this is a long one, too.

734
00:50:49,334 --> 00:50:54,020
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I'm going to go over this.

735
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:54,581
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure.

736
00:50:54,601 --> 00:50:56,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, this is a very long email.

737
00:50:58,526 --> 00:50:58,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

738
00:50:59,648 --> 00:51:02,231
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to say it's from Kenji.

739
00:51:02,872 --> 00:51:03,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Kenji?

740
00:51:06,017 --> 00:51:09,138
[SPEAKER_05]: To go with this, congratulations on your upcoming 200 episodes.

741
00:51:09,178 --> 00:51:16,961
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been watching OLR since the late 80 episodes, and while I've been unable to watch you guys on a consistent basis... That's amazing seeing we're a radio program.

742
00:51:16,981 --> 00:51:23,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I applaud your perseverance against the Machina-dominant, big-wig, video game journalist.

743
00:51:23,182 --> 00:51:24,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Praise Yevon Er... I mean, Orange Islands Radio.

744
00:51:26,465 --> 00:51:29,106
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a feeling this is going to be a long email, please brace yourselves.

745
00:51:29,886 --> 00:51:32,247
[SPEAKER_03]: I went into the email box and actually read the email.

746
00:51:32,287 --> 00:51:36,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Was this the one that was about the really in-depth analysis about Sony?

747
00:51:38,789 --> 00:51:39,669
[SPEAKER_03]: I think.

748
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:41,129
[SPEAKER_03]: I could be crossing my wires here.

749
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:45,951
[SPEAKER_05]: E3 and Mardi Gras.

750
00:51:47,411 --> 00:51:50,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, there's the Sony Microsoft deal gameplay, yeah.

751
00:51:51,266 --> 00:51:52,107
[SPEAKER_05]: It's long, okay.

752
00:51:52,127 --> 00:51:54,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'll go with the gameplay.

753
00:52:16,252 --> 00:52:45,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Since the handheld love, the adoration for everyone's favorite innocently yet so vulgarly named Wii, games with the ability to simply pick up and play, and of all things retro gaming, see the Intellivision Live's console and target, the mock-up 2600s that now store pretty much every good Atari game within its tape deck-like cabinet, the TV games that were on everyone's Christmas wish list a year ago or so,

754
00:52:46,676 --> 00:52:53,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there is a growing community that realizes that maybe the forefathers of video gaming had something going, Pong graphically sucked balls.

755
00:52:54,103 --> 00:52:54,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Great description.

756
00:52:55,124 --> 00:52:59,248
[SPEAKER_05]: But it still has the staying power due to its, at the time, imaginative gameplay.

757
00:52:59,588 --> 00:53:00,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Mario Bros.

758
00:53:00,389 --> 00:53:07,315
[SPEAKER_05]: was beautiful in the fact that it only took at most two lives for even the most dimwitted of people to get the hang of what you had to do, and the list goes on and on.

759
00:53:08,015 --> 00:53:08,837
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to keep going a little bit.

760
00:53:09,378 --> 00:53:18,415
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, what do the majority of people who game on their PSUs, NES, SNES, Neo Geo, and Genesis emulators nonetheless?

761
00:53:19,517 --> 00:53:20,298
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good point.

762
00:53:23,328 --> 00:53:32,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Gunpei, who is Mr. Yokoi's magnum opus for the Wonderswan, is now being remade for the current bit generations and touch generations.

763
00:53:32,733 --> 00:53:41,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Our catering to a whole new type of game, our Xbox Live Arcade, is an ingenious Microsoft strategy that I applaud even if I do loathe their very being.

764
00:53:42,082 --> 00:53:43,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's a really long email.

765
00:53:43,163 --> 00:53:48,488
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, if you don't mind, I would like to actually put this letter up on our forums.

766
00:53:48,628 --> 00:53:48,888
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

767
00:53:49,048 --> 00:53:57,196
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're listening, which we hope if you're listening to the podcast right now, just shoot me an email at jamie at orange.radio.com and let me know if you're fine with that.

768
00:53:57,356 --> 00:53:57,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet.

769
00:53:58,216 --> 00:54:02,180
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, just to respond to that about the retro gaming, I think the person's got a good point there.

770
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Xbox Live Arcade as well.

771
00:54:03,881 --> 00:54:05,483
[SPEAKER_03]: That practically sold the system for me.

772
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:11,453
[SPEAKER_03]: because the launch titles didn't rock my world but I knew that Arcade was this great thing and there were a couple launch titles I wanted.

773
00:54:12,635 --> 00:54:16,041
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think...

774
00:54:16,875 --> 00:54:21,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if a game is old and has basic graphics, it doesn't mean it's going to be a bad game.

775
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:24,760
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think people do have a lot of respect for the retro graphics.

776
00:54:25,201 --> 00:54:32,005
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, of course, a little game called Geometry Wars, I think, woke everybody up to that fact, really, in this next-gen battle.

777
00:54:32,065 --> 00:54:37,749
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think you are going to see the retro factor really start to kind of crank up a little bit in this next-gen.

778
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:45,975
[SPEAKER_05]: There's actually a very good comparison to one of Tezuka's comics.

779
00:54:47,335 --> 00:54:49,096
[SPEAKER_05]: and I guess the current industry.

780
00:54:49,356 --> 00:54:50,916
[SPEAKER_05]: I really want to put this up on the site.

781
00:54:50,956 --> 00:54:53,437
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very long and I'm not going to do it justice reading it over the air.

782
00:54:53,917 --> 00:54:56,677
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd really like permission to post it up on the site.

783
00:54:56,717 --> 00:54:57,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Just let me know, please.

784
00:54:57,618 --> 00:54:57,878
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

785
00:54:58,138 --> 00:54:58,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Any more emails?

786
00:54:59,158 --> 00:54:59,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

787
00:54:59,718 --> 00:54:59,978
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

788
00:55:01,219 --> 00:55:02,739
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I have no more email.

789
00:55:04,739 --> 00:55:05,640
[SPEAKER_03]: One week you weren't here.

790
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:06,560
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to the mailbag.

791
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:07,480
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like nothing there.

792
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:08,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, wow.

793
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:09,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie was gone.

794
00:55:09,601 --> 00:55:11,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, no need to email.

795
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:12,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, watch that ego.

796
00:55:12,701 --> 00:55:14,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, my email is great.

797
00:55:14,922 --> 00:55:15,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

798
00:55:16,488 --> 00:55:20,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, this is from, I guess, Stickaxe?

799
00:55:20,271 --> 00:55:22,633
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have a signature on here, so I'm just... Oh, Eric, sorry.

800
00:55:23,714 --> 00:55:27,438
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are absolutely the greatest audio-only entertainment out there, no questions asked.

801
00:55:27,498 --> 00:55:29,680
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Eric, and I write to you from Indiana.

802
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:38,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, you are amazing, awesome, superior, great, mighty, sweet, strong, marvelous, almighty, godlike, admirable, excellent, satisfying, pleasing, respectable, gnarly, stupendous, and honorable.

803
00:55:40,489 --> 00:55:41,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Who was that?

804
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:43,831
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

805
00:55:44,331 --> 00:55:46,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Who was that that they were talking about?

806
00:55:46,412 --> 00:55:48,492
[SPEAKER_05]: They were talking about Loki.

807
00:55:48,792 --> 00:55:49,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, is this the one?

808
00:55:50,193 --> 00:55:51,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was the one I mentioned.

809
00:55:51,974 --> 00:55:52,994
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I know, it's funny.

810
00:55:54,014 --> 00:55:55,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, you are just absolutely amazing.

811
00:55:56,255 --> 00:55:56,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, thank you.

812
00:55:57,035 --> 00:56:00,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Skye, I'm sorry, man, but you honestly have to try and shut up for more than 10 seconds at a time.

813
00:56:02,877 --> 00:56:06,039
[SPEAKER_05]: As he drinks his ginger beer.

814
00:56:06,519 --> 00:56:07,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Not talking.

815
00:56:08,484 --> 00:56:11,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

816
00:56:11,605 --> 00:56:12,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope, sorry.

817
00:56:12,505 --> 00:56:12,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't talk.

818
00:56:13,066 --> 00:56:14,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Listeners don't like me talking.

819
00:56:14,646 --> 00:56:15,386
[SPEAKER_03]: I talk too damn much.

820
00:56:16,847 --> 00:56:17,527
[SPEAKER_05]: I like you talking.

821
00:56:19,188 --> 00:56:20,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope, I make this show too gay.

822
00:56:20,568 --> 00:56:21,289
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't talk anymore.

823
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:28,331
[SPEAKER_03]: This Rob is... Our show is... This Rob is gay.

824
00:56:28,471 --> 00:56:30,312
[SPEAKER_03]: This Rob is very gay.

825
00:56:31,312 --> 00:56:32,833
[SPEAKER_03]: What is wrong with this Rob?

826
00:56:32,893 --> 00:56:33,873
[SPEAKER_03]: He's so gay.

827
00:56:33,913 --> 00:56:35,273
[SPEAKER_03]: He gays up orange line radio.

828
00:56:35,293 --> 00:56:36,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob is our facilitator.

829
00:56:37,290 --> 00:56:38,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob is our facilitator.

830
00:56:38,531 --> 00:56:40,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I do talk too much.

831
00:56:41,852 --> 00:56:46,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep in mind, kids, what I do for a living, I talk all day to people and they are paid to listen to me.

832
00:56:47,035 --> 00:56:48,596
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a trainer, basically.

833
00:56:49,076 --> 00:56:50,117
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't shut up.

834
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:50,717
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my nature.

835
00:56:50,757 --> 00:56:51,157
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

836
00:56:52,178 --> 00:56:52,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Hugs and kisses.

837
00:56:53,934 --> 00:56:57,077
[SPEAKER_05]: With all of that out of the way, I was seriously wondering something.

838
00:56:58,798 --> 00:57:00,760
[SPEAKER_05]: The one I got was crap.

839
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:04,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably mentioned it on one of your earlier shows, so I apologize.

840
00:57:04,823 --> 00:57:07,045
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a big fanboy of the show Stargate SG-1.

841
00:57:07,105 --> 00:57:07,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I love you.

842
00:57:08,166 --> 00:57:12,750
[SPEAKER_05]: And last year I heard there was going to be a Stargate SG-1 video game coming out later that year.

843
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:16,333
[SPEAKER_05]: I was really excited about it at first and sort of forgot about it as time went on.

844
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:17,294
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

845
00:57:32,948 --> 00:57:36,009
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the answer to the guy's question but I can't talk.

846
00:57:55,129 --> 00:57:55,909
[SPEAKER_05]: It was canceled.

847
00:57:56,329 --> 00:57:57,170
[SPEAKER_05]: They did cancel it.

848
00:57:57,710 --> 00:58:01,911
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want, however, I did take pictures of their area.

849
00:58:02,091 --> 00:58:03,371
[SPEAKER_05]: I took pictures of the game.

850
00:58:04,732 --> 00:58:05,732
[SPEAKER_05]: I can get all that up.

851
00:58:06,012 --> 00:58:08,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, our gallery from that E3 should still be up.

852
00:58:09,393 --> 00:58:09,753
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it is.

853
00:58:10,393 --> 00:58:12,054
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of my pictures are there.

854
00:58:12,194 --> 00:58:15,855
[SPEAKER_05]: You can check them out in our picture gallery on OrangeOwlRadio.com.

855
00:58:15,895 --> 00:58:16,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Who remembers?

856
00:58:16,455 --> 00:58:17,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did they cancel that?

857
00:58:17,435 --> 00:58:21,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Stargate really does have a nerd-tastic following to it, and that's not a bad thing.

858
00:58:21,597 --> 00:58:21,937
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good show.

859
00:58:21,957 --> 00:58:22,317
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty good.

860
00:58:23,878 --> 00:58:28,081
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a first-person shooter, and I think it was really great.

861
00:58:28,121 --> 00:58:32,183
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish they had kept going with it, because I would have bought that day one.

862
00:58:32,724 --> 00:58:34,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Solarwing in the chatroom read my mind.

863
00:58:34,605 --> 00:58:38,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Battlestar Galactica, the video game, that's just a matter of time, yes?

864
00:58:39,308 --> 00:58:39,689
[SPEAKER_05]: One would hope.

865
00:58:39,749 --> 00:58:43,031
[SPEAKER_05]: I want a Doctor Who video game, because I'm into my Doctor Who fandom.

866
00:58:43,792 --> 00:58:46,113
[SPEAKER_05]: But as for the very end, I'm also becoming a bit confused.

867
00:58:46,133 --> 00:58:50,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Would it be possible for you guys to list every gaming console you've ever owned in your long lifespan, please?

868
00:58:50,957 --> 00:58:52,518
[SPEAKER_05]: We do not have a show long enough...

869
00:58:53,931 --> 00:58:55,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I still currently own them.

870
00:58:57,573 --> 00:59:00,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless you've got time for me to list off about 40-something video game systems.

871
00:59:00,874 --> 00:59:01,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

872
00:59:02,675 --> 00:59:03,355
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a virtual boy.

873
00:59:03,815 --> 00:59:10,458
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I was just thinking, if they made video games out of TV shows I watch, video game industry would die.

874
00:59:10,478 --> 00:59:11,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Big Brother the game.

875
00:59:11,779 --> 00:59:12,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Big Brother the video game.

876
00:59:15,034 --> 00:59:17,136
[SPEAKER_03]: For anyone that reads my live journal, I never talk about games.

877
00:59:17,176 --> 00:59:18,677
[SPEAKER_03]: I just talk about the TV show Big Brother.

878
00:59:19,938 --> 00:59:21,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you imagine Big Brother the video game?

879
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:27,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Three people in my car, me who does not watch TV, I just buy box sets, talking about Big Brother.

880
00:59:29,547 --> 00:59:31,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Press the A button to continue.

881
00:59:31,549 --> 00:59:33,871
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, a live eviction... Never mind.

882
00:59:34,753 --> 00:59:35,773
[SPEAKER_03]: DMN hates me, there it is in chat.

883
00:59:35,793 --> 00:59:35,914
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

884
00:59:35,934 --> 00:59:36,294
[SPEAKER_03]: DMN, you bastard.

885
00:59:36,314 --> 00:59:38,335
[SPEAKER_05]: He doesn't really hate me.

886
00:59:38,355 --> 00:59:38,655
[SPEAKER_05]: And look.

887
01:00:01,727 --> 01:00:03,869
[SPEAKER_03]: SolarWing says Big Brother could be an MMO.

888
01:00:04,089 --> 01:00:05,730
[SPEAKER_03]: VidPower admits to watching Big Brother.

889
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:12,275
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we have UK listeners, and I know it's a completely different show here than it is over there, but I know it's crazy over there.

890
01:00:12,696 --> 01:00:13,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, sorry.

891
01:00:13,696 --> 01:00:14,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Video games.

892
01:00:14,297 --> 01:00:14,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

893
01:00:14,537 --> 01:00:14,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

894
01:00:15,518 --> 01:00:17,739
[SPEAKER_05]: This one comes from Distinct.

895
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:19,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, all.

896
01:00:19,881 --> 01:00:23,924
[SPEAKER_05]: The store I run sells games, and we've got release dates for Wii games coming November 1st.

897
01:00:24,505 --> 01:00:28,648
[SPEAKER_05]: I know these usually change a lot, but I think if Nintendo was going to do an October launch, then the games...

898
01:00:29,908 --> 01:00:31,249
[SPEAKER_05]: would be listed for October.

899
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:40,456
[SPEAKER_05]: So it looks like to me the Wii is going to drop a week or two before the PS3, which we have dates for games as well, and they're all around the same time as the PS3 launch.

900
01:00:40,917 --> 01:00:42,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Here are some release dates for other titles.

901
01:00:42,398 --> 01:00:47,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki probably is on top of this already, but in case something's different from what you've heard, Lost Planet, Xbox 360, January 31st.

902
01:00:50,882 --> 01:01:00,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Soprano Xbox 360 November 14th, Darkness Xbox 360 March 31st, Superman Xbox 360 December 1st, and Rainbow Six Vegas on Xbox 360 November 15th.

903
01:01:01,547 --> 01:01:04,088
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of other titles dropping the same time as PS3 launch.

904
01:01:04,228 --> 01:01:10,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Oddly enough, we have no confirmed date for Gears of War, which has actually had a date announced to the press.

905
01:01:12,692 --> 01:01:13,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, great show.

906
01:01:13,353 --> 01:01:16,114
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought I'd try and give some info, but like I said, you probably know this already.

907
01:01:17,219 --> 01:01:18,140
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

908
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:42,201
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

909
01:01:58,484 --> 01:01:59,766
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

910
01:02:13,584 --> 01:02:14,825
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I might want to pick up that game.

911
01:02:15,345 --> 01:02:16,206
[SPEAKER_03]: I really might.

912
01:02:16,266 --> 01:02:20,109
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not as awful as the one that was on the Nintendo 64.

913
01:02:20,289 --> 01:02:20,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

914
01:02:20,689 --> 01:02:21,290
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

915
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:22,791
[SPEAKER_02]: At E3, it was awesome.

916
01:02:22,811 --> 01:02:24,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine Grand Theft Auto, but you're Superman.

917
01:02:25,153 --> 01:02:26,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I'd be all over that.

918
01:02:26,414 --> 01:02:29,316
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be as badass as Superman on the Atari 2600 was.

919
01:02:30,837 --> 01:02:31,677
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe, what was it?

920
01:02:32,318 --> 01:02:35,360
[SPEAKER_01]: Death and Return of Superman, one of the few beat-em-ups Blizzard ever made.

921
01:02:36,921 --> 01:02:37,121
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

922
01:02:37,242 --> 01:02:41,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, anyways, while we're on the subject here, I thought I would, you know, clear up a few things.

923
01:02:41,825 --> 01:02:41,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

924
01:02:42,697 --> 01:02:47,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, as far as release dates go, I think that was about right.

925
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:54,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, I know Lost Planet is coming out in January because they were saying that no other games are coming out in January and you'll pretty much own January.

926
01:02:56,244 --> 01:03:03,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I know there have been a lot of... I'm sure that you saw this too in our wonderful Under the Radar thread that we have in our forums.

927
01:03:04,127 --> 01:03:07,249
[SPEAKER_02]: There have been a lot of the stories that we've been talking about have appeared...

928
01:03:08,766 --> 01:03:09,166
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on.

929
01:03:35,299 --> 01:03:39,941
[SPEAKER_02]: I know he doesn't listen to the show very much, but Bad Bobby, no cookie for you.

930
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:45,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, to go ahead and gear this back towards the email.

931
01:03:45,162 --> 01:03:48,783
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got a story coming up that addresses something we brought up last week.

932
01:03:49,063 --> 01:03:50,584
[SPEAKER_03]: You're trying to make a preemptive strike here.

933
01:03:50,624 --> 01:03:51,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Let her finish the damn email.

934
01:03:52,284 --> 01:03:55,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Warrior Bob writes in and says, Hey there, OLR crew.

935
01:03:55,185 --> 01:03:59,067
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been like a year or something since I've written in, but you're still awesome and I'm still listening.

936
01:03:59,147 --> 01:04:00,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for all the great podcasts.

937
01:04:00,527 --> 01:04:01,507
[SPEAKER_05]: for all the great podcasts.

938
01:04:02,067 --> 01:04:02,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Comments for each of you.

939
01:04:03,187 --> 01:04:11,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Sky, I was just listening to your last podcast and you were asking about disconnects in Street Fighter 2 HF on Xbox Live.

940
01:04:11,609 --> 01:04:15,250
[SPEAKER_05]: I can assure you that a disconnect counts as a win for the person who didn't disconnect.

941
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:18,610
[SPEAKER_05]: I got my achievement for 20 wins online when the other guy timed out.

942
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:19,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Hot.

943
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:20,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, good.

944
01:04:20,570 --> 01:04:21,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to know.

945
01:04:21,651 --> 01:04:21,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

946
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:29,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, a friend of mine runs a college radio show about video games at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and called me on

947
01:04:29,929 --> 01:04:30,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Frequently as a co-host.

948
01:04:31,030 --> 01:04:33,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Like any person, I've got influence in how I approach something.

949
01:04:34,151 --> 01:04:44,055
[SPEAKER_05]: After a few months of broadcasting, I realized that even if I don't agree with you all the time, even most of the time, your style on air is basically my biggest influence and I wanted to write and say so so that you can have the ego boost you rightfully deserve.

950
01:04:45,636 --> 01:04:48,857
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the equivalent of a man hug, I think.

951
01:04:48,938 --> 01:04:49,898
[SPEAKER_03]: That was very nice.

952
01:04:50,378 --> 01:04:52,999
[SPEAKER_05]: One to me, Byright is a false icon.

953
01:04:53,179 --> 01:04:53,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes!

954
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:55,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn them to hell!

955
01:04:57,361 --> 01:04:58,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, my ears are ringing.

956
01:04:58,542 --> 01:04:58,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

957
01:04:59,249 --> 01:05:00,130
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll hold the microphone away.

958
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:00,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I know.

959
01:05:01,192 --> 01:05:02,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't help me in studio.

960
01:05:04,637 --> 01:05:07,722
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys all rule and I look forward to this week's show just like I do every week.

961
01:05:07,802 --> 01:05:08,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care.

962
01:05:08,804 --> 01:05:09,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's so nice.

963
01:05:09,745 --> 01:05:10,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

964
01:05:10,066 --> 01:05:11,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I love the ego boost email.

965
01:05:12,089 --> 01:05:14,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we should run down to Cal Poly and do a show.

966
01:05:14,730 --> 01:05:15,270
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.

967
01:05:16,311 --> 01:05:21,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that the same person that wanted us to go there to do some type of panel thingy?

968
01:05:21,715 --> 01:05:22,495
[SPEAKER_03]: That was about a year ago.

969
01:05:22,515 --> 01:05:23,536
[SPEAKER_05]: We couldn't make it at that time.

970
01:05:23,576 --> 01:05:24,977
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't work out, unfortunately.

971
01:05:25,638 --> 01:05:27,159
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to go on the road.

972
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:27,719
[SPEAKER_05]: We do.

973
01:05:27,759 --> 01:05:29,881
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to go on a college tour across America.

974
01:05:30,701 --> 01:05:34,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure that you have kegs with good beer.

975
01:05:34,104 --> 01:05:35,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Just bring Guinness kegs.

976
01:05:35,104 --> 01:05:36,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Bring Guinness, bring bass.

977
01:05:36,385 --> 01:05:37,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Drunami will be our roadie.

978
01:05:37,786 --> 01:05:38,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Bring me some fat tire.

979
01:05:38,587 --> 01:05:39,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris can be our tour manager.

980
01:05:39,667 --> 01:05:42,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

981
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:43,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

982
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:44,381
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm old, I go to bed early.

983
01:05:44,421 --> 01:05:45,121
[SPEAKER_03]: I like pillow fights.

984
01:06:02,728 --> 01:06:05,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey OLR, this is from DMN, oh my god.

985
01:06:06,589 --> 01:06:10,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi DMN, and this is the one that I said I would read.

986
01:06:10,690 --> 01:06:16,011
[SPEAKER_05]: I was wondering what your opinion on Guitar Hero 2 retailing for $49.99, this being for the game only.

987
01:06:16,511 --> 01:06:26,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you guys think that with this being the first music game being priced for over $40, that the sales of this game will be hampered, or will this encourage the sale of the bundle to people who already own the game?

988
01:06:26,773 --> 01:06:28,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, your thoughts on Dance Factory.

989
01:06:28,513 --> 01:06:28,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

990
01:06:30,029 --> 01:06:30,569
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR in the groove even.

991
01:06:30,589 --> 01:06:31,190
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't imagine...

992
01:06:59,204 --> 01:07:03,385
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as Guitar Hero 2 going for $49.99, I do think that's a bit excessive for price.

993
01:07:04,105 --> 01:07:15,429
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that for those of us who already have it, the game should retail around, I'd say, between $30 and $40 and make a really good deal for the guitar bundle.

994
01:07:15,909 --> 01:07:18,029
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like $60 for the guitar bundle or something like that.

995
01:07:18,209 --> 01:07:19,350
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how I think it should be.

996
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:22,731
[SPEAKER_05]: $50 for the game only is excessive, I believe.

997
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:24,391
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

998
01:07:26,281 --> 01:07:30,824
[SPEAKER_05]: I was gonna say something last week and I took mercy on you, but dear god in heaven, why?! !

999
01:07:55,396 --> 01:07:57,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob is back on Final Fantasy XI!

1000
01:07:57,756 --> 01:07:58,697
[SPEAKER_04]: You traitor!

1001
01:08:00,337 --> 01:08:02,317
[SPEAKER_05]: You are a traitor and a liar.

1002
01:08:03,337 --> 01:08:04,658
[SPEAKER_05]: And you need to be spanked.

1003
01:08:06,538 --> 01:08:07,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris, spank him for me.

1004
01:08:09,559 --> 01:08:10,419
[SPEAKER_03]: A little harder, please.

1005
01:08:10,459 --> 01:08:13,499
[SPEAKER_03]: You, Mr. F, quit World of Warcraft.

1006
01:08:13,559 --> 01:08:15,100
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not quit World of Warcraft.

1007
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,100
[SPEAKER_05]: My account is still active.

1008
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:18,740
[SPEAKER_05]: You sit down and drink your goddamn tea.

1009
01:08:23,602 --> 01:08:36,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio is quite possibly the only video game podcast on the entire internet that has lesbians spanking gay men over MMOs.

1010
01:08:37,349 --> 01:08:41,391
[SPEAKER_05]: And to correct myself, it's sit your ass down on that chair and drink your goddamn tea.

1011
01:08:43,331 --> 01:08:44,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Lesbians are always relevant.

1012
01:08:47,657 --> 01:08:52,782
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Janai wants me to hit him with the yaoi paddle stick.

1013
01:09:09,977 --> 01:09:10,677
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to make one.

1014
01:09:10,877 --> 01:09:12,538
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to make... Okay.

1015
01:09:12,998 --> 01:09:15,079
[SPEAKER_03]: What's this, we're going to YowieCon?

1016
01:09:15,119 --> 01:09:16,880
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard that coming out of your mouth there.

1017
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:24,223
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard this, we're going to... No, we as in me and Chris and Megzie and another one of our friends is going to YowieCon this year.

1018
01:09:24,864 --> 01:09:26,625
[SPEAKER_05]: So we need to make Yowie Behave paddles.

1019
01:09:26,845 --> 01:09:29,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, look, we gotta wrap this up because we still have DDR...

1020
01:09:30,802 --> 01:09:32,683
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw the DDR previews of this segment.

1021
01:09:32,983 --> 01:09:35,525
[SPEAKER_03]: And whoever that little rat informant is in chat, I'm going to find you.

1022
01:09:35,545 --> 01:09:36,206
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get you.

1023
01:09:36,366 --> 01:09:37,887
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's DMN.

1024
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:38,727
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's him.

1025
01:09:39,067 --> 01:09:39,988
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not DMN.

1026
01:09:40,048 --> 01:09:40,308
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1027
01:09:41,289 --> 01:09:42,290
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to own DMN anyway.

1028
01:09:42,310 --> 01:09:43,230
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to figure out who you are.

1029
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:43,851
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to beat you up.

1030
01:09:43,891 --> 01:09:44,171
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1031
01:09:45,131 --> 01:09:45,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Send us an email.

1032
01:09:45,672 --> 01:09:46,012
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Ranchan.

1033
01:09:46,412 --> 01:09:48,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Mailbag at Orange Lounge Radio.

1034
01:09:48,173 --> 01:09:49,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Ranchan.

1035
01:09:49,074 --> 01:09:50,175
[SPEAKER_05]: I love you.

1036
01:09:50,435 --> 01:09:51,576
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm coming to New York, too.

1037
01:09:53,417 --> 01:09:55,338
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm bringing my Yowie paddle.

1038
01:09:55,378 --> 01:09:57,479
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way... DMN says, fuck you, Rob.

1039
01:09:57,519 --> 01:09:57,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Check...

1040
01:10:01,263 --> 01:10:02,784
[SPEAKER_03]: You name the time and the place, I'll be there.

1041
01:10:02,844 --> 01:10:03,224
[SPEAKER_03]: No pants.

1042
01:10:03,804 --> 01:10:07,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Tape it!

1043
01:10:07,346 --> 01:10:08,747
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only porn if you get it on tape.

1044
01:10:08,767 --> 01:10:11,908
[SPEAKER_03]: I am turning this car around and we are going back to On Topic Road.

1045
01:10:12,249 --> 01:10:12,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now.

1046
01:10:17,830 --> 01:10:26,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Check the Orange Launch Radio forums because Sky is coming to New York City in October and we'll be doing a meetup, I think, at the Nintendo Store, possibly somewhere else.

1047
01:10:26,974 --> 01:10:27,514
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure yet.

1048
01:10:28,014 --> 01:10:36,358
[SPEAKER_03]: But check the forums for more information if you're in New York City because I want to meet some fans and maybe tape a live segment or something to let our East Coasters have a part on the show.

1049
01:10:36,938 --> 01:10:37,198
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1050
01:10:38,206 --> 01:10:38,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Back to games.

1051
01:10:39,027 --> 01:10:47,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Paper Mario, a game I'm very, very much looking forward to that was going to be coming out for the GameCube, is now not going to be coming out for the GameCube.

1052
01:10:47,653 --> 01:10:47,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Rumored.

1053
01:10:48,874 --> 01:10:50,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's a rumor, but this seems like a pretty good one to me.

1054
01:10:51,136 --> 01:10:53,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Rumored until Thursday when they announce it officially.

1055
01:10:53,417 --> 01:10:57,400
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand why they would continue to build all these GameCube games.

1056
01:10:58,121 --> 01:10:59,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, I guess the Wii can play them.

1057
01:11:00,242 --> 01:11:00,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1058
01:11:00,903 --> 01:11:01,583
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I think?

1059
01:11:01,763 --> 01:11:03,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so Super Paper Mario, obviously, is going to be...

1060
01:11:04,246 --> 01:11:04,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming out for the Wii.

1061
01:11:04,906 --> 01:11:09,708
[SPEAKER_03]: This is coming off some IGN dude's blog that says, Hmm, how should I write this?

1062
01:11:10,228 --> 01:11:11,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Have to be vague, you know?

1063
01:11:11,188 --> 01:11:15,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me just say that, yes, Paper Mario will be headed to Wii and not GameCube.

1064
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:17,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, read between the lines, damn you.

1065
01:11:17,130 --> 01:11:18,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, that was a terrible hint.

1066
01:11:18,951 --> 01:11:19,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that's it for today.

1067
01:11:19,911 --> 01:11:20,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Time to beat Bozone.

1068
01:11:21,151 --> 01:11:27,633
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was coming from Matt Casamassina from IGN, who apparently gets more insider knowledge than we do.

1069
01:11:27,673 --> 01:11:28,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

1070
01:11:29,234 --> 01:11:32,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, I would bet anything maybe it's one of those games where

1071
01:11:33,203 --> 01:11:38,685
[SPEAKER_03]: There's more features on the Wii than there are on the GameCube.

1072
01:11:39,505 --> 01:11:46,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Not like Zelda where there's two separate versions, but I think about those games like the Zelda games that were on the Color Game Boy.

1073
01:11:46,627 --> 01:11:48,827
[SPEAKER_03]: When you put them in the Advance, you got the Advance Store.

1074
01:11:49,027 --> 01:11:49,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what was it?

1075
01:11:49,908 --> 01:11:52,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Oracle of Ages, Seasons, whatever that was.

1076
01:11:52,589 --> 01:11:54,409
[SPEAKER_03]: You had extra stuff if you played it in the Advance.

1077
01:11:54,489 --> 01:11:57,530
[SPEAKER_03]: That would seem logical to me and a very Nintendo thing to do.

1078
01:11:57,570 --> 01:12:00,531
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty interesting that Matt Casamena...

1079
01:12:01,701 --> 01:12:03,042
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1080
01:12:28,174 --> 01:12:41,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, to this credit though, I'm actually going to give the doubt, you know, if they went to Ubisoft and talked about it directly, they probably didn't get it from the show, but doesn't that validate what you were saying last week, at least part of it?

1081
01:12:41,999 --> 01:12:45,901
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm saying, I don't say that, you know, it's not legit and they...

1082
01:12:46,243 --> 01:12:46,563
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

1083
01:13:13,971 --> 01:13:16,492
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, other things that kind of go along with that.

1084
01:13:16,992 --> 01:13:23,575
[SPEAKER_02]: One up ran a story this week talking about the PS2 Slim coming out in a silver color, as reported on episode 196.

1085
01:13:25,716 --> 01:13:32,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Kotaku reported on a brand new PSP Entertainment bundle that's going to be coming out, as we reported on episode 196.

1086
01:13:32,879 --> 01:13:37,820
[SPEAKER_02]: This story, of course, we talked about, came out last week, we talked about that.

1087
01:13:39,722 --> 01:13:46,465
[SPEAKER_02]: IGN also ran a story about the grim adventures of Billy and Mandy coming out for the Wii as reported on episode 195.

1088
01:13:47,625 --> 01:13:52,267
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, yeah, so it's not a big surprise here.

1089
01:13:52,427 --> 01:13:52,768
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1090
01:13:52,828 --> 01:13:59,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Our t-shirts should have that big, should have that picture of the alien spaceship that you see on it.

1091
01:13:59,650 --> 01:14:02,231
[SPEAKER_03]: And it says, I believe, and then in parentheses, OLR.

1092
01:14:04,412 --> 01:14:05,633
[SPEAKER_03]: That could be our shirts.

1093
01:14:07,887 --> 01:14:09,487
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to believe, OLR

1094
01:14:37,759 --> 01:14:38,800
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just giving Bobby a hard time.

1095
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:40,741
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, we love Bobby.

1096
01:14:40,761 --> 01:14:45,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby's awesome, but I always have to give him... Allgames.com, Sunday nights, 5 o'clock, Bobby Blackwolf Show.

1097
01:14:45,845 --> 01:14:46,525
[SPEAKER_03]: It's rad.

1098
01:14:48,006 --> 01:14:48,907
[SPEAKER_03]: So, alright.

1099
01:14:51,829 --> 01:14:52,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we ready for the next story?

1100
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:54,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Next story?

1101
01:14:55,051 --> 01:14:55,492
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1102
01:14:55,552 --> 01:14:56,913
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm going to, like, boycott.

1103
01:14:57,713 --> 01:14:58,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

1104
01:14:58,554 --> 01:14:59,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I don't like this game.

1105
01:15:00,255 --> 01:15:01,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, read it anyway.

1106
01:15:01,616 --> 01:15:02,076
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I know.

1107
01:15:02,096 --> 01:15:02,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1108
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:13,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, there is going to be a progressive scan in 16 to 9 widescreen mode for Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam.

1109
01:15:14,886 --> 01:15:15,986
[SPEAKER_03]: On what system, does it say?

1110
01:15:16,727 --> 01:15:17,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's only for the Wii.

1111
01:15:17,827 --> 01:15:18,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the Wii?

1112
01:15:19,229 --> 01:15:26,716
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, you know what, that's neat, that's great, but not too surprising because when we saw Elebits at the Konami thing, it was running widescreen.

1113
01:15:26,736 --> 01:15:32,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and it was supposed to be, I think they were supposed to be doing 480p and widescreen on the games anyways.

1114
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:34,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Weren't all the games we saw at E3 on widescreen?

1115
01:15:34,923 --> 01:15:35,883
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so, so.

1116
01:15:36,064 --> 01:15:36,644
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of weird.

1117
01:15:37,024 --> 01:15:42,749
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, not to belittle your story, but I'm just saying, you know, because somebody else picked up that story, I'm just kind of like, well, weren't they all kind of showing in widescreen anyway?

1118
01:15:43,110 --> 01:15:43,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1119
01:15:44,281 --> 01:15:48,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe because people are ragging on the graphics of the Wii, saying it's not going to be as good as the other systems.

1120
01:15:48,522 --> 01:15:49,442
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it looks fine.

1121
01:15:49,482 --> 01:15:51,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's something to show that, hey, at least they still support widescreen.

1122
01:15:51,902 --> 01:15:52,522
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little something.

1123
01:15:52,862 --> 01:15:53,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1124
01:15:53,423 --> 01:15:58,423
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, they showed the first screenshots of GT on IGN, and it actually looks pretty cool.

1125
01:15:58,443 --> 01:16:03,544
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all cel-shaded, so it kind of reminds me a little bit of, like, Crazy Taxi, but a racing game.

1126
01:16:04,124 --> 01:16:05,105
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.

1127
01:16:05,125 --> 01:16:05,805
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.

1128
01:16:06,665 --> 01:16:06,905
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1129
01:16:07,145 --> 01:16:07,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

1130
01:16:08,265 --> 01:16:12,706
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to point out as well, I saw part of the reason that Final Fantasy XII has taken an

1131
01:16:13,459 --> 01:16:13,679
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on.

1132
01:16:40,151 --> 01:16:40,771
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura

1133
01:17:00,063 --> 01:17:26,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Excitebike, F-Zero, Kid Icarus, The Legend of Zelda, The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, Mario Kart 64, The Original Metroid, Mortal Kombat, New Adventure Island, Ninja Gaiden, Outrun, Pac-Man, Prince of Persia, I imagine the original, Punch-Out, R-Type, Rayman 2, Sonic the Hedgehog, Star Fox, Super Mario 64, Super Mario Brothers, Super Mario Kart, Super Mario World, and Tecmo Bowl.

1134
01:17:27,048 --> 01:17:28,969
[SPEAKER_02]: R-Type, R-Type, R-Type, R-Type

1135
01:17:57,935 --> 01:18:01,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Where some of the more Genesis games are.

1136
01:18:01,117 --> 01:18:03,318
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll probably just slowly roll out, don't you think?

1137
01:18:03,878 --> 01:18:04,959
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1138
01:18:05,099 --> 01:18:06,420
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of a wait and see.

1139
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:07,781
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see how this thing's going to look.

1140
01:18:08,241 --> 01:18:15,345
[SPEAKER_02]: To be honest, Virtual Console is awesome and stuff, but it's not why I'm buying the system.

1141
01:18:16,185 --> 01:18:20,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now we're going to get into a part of the show that I think a lot of you guys have been waiting for.

1142
01:18:21,323 --> 01:18:21,683
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

1143
01:18:44,338 --> 01:18:46,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Some folks criticized it for how diverse it was.

1144
01:18:47,561 --> 01:18:48,401
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's going to be interesting.

1145
01:18:48,441 --> 01:18:52,765
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you're going to find that Ultramix 4, the song list was previously announced and posted to our website.

1146
01:18:53,365 --> 01:18:53,906
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of...

1147
01:18:54,983 --> 01:18:55,103
[SPEAKER_03]: XBOX 360

1148
01:19:23,086 --> 01:19:23,286
[SPEAKER_03]: D.D.R.

1149
01:19:23,366 --> 01:19:23,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Universe, D.D.R.

1150
01:19:23,827 --> 01:19:24,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Ultramix 4

1151
01:19:53,027 --> 01:19:55,648
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's pretty much going to be the same rhythm we're going to do throughout the promotion.

1152
01:19:55,668 --> 01:19:57,549
[SPEAKER_03]: It's two songs from each game each week.

1153
01:19:58,010 --> 01:20:00,531
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess we should just get it started, shouldn't we?

1154
01:20:00,851 --> 01:20:01,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1155
01:20:01,131 --> 01:20:02,572
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's tonight's first song.

1156
01:20:02,732 --> 01:20:05,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight's first song is from DDR Universe.

1157
01:20:05,873 --> 01:20:10,116
[SPEAKER_03]: And this first one is going to be a long version because we have some long versions sprinkled out throughout the promotion.

1158
01:20:10,496 --> 01:20:14,418
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a brand new original song and it's by an artist called Drew Campbell.

1159
01:20:14,818 --> 01:20:15,898
[SPEAKER_03]: And the song is called 8-Bit.

1160
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:22,562
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think what you're going to dig about this song is that the title describes the sound of the song.

1161
01:20:22,982 --> 01:20:25,404
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think you guys are going to really dig this track.

1162
01:20:25,464 --> 01:20:33,348
[SPEAKER_03]: So here it is to kick off our series of DDR sneak peeks here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1163
01:20:33,368 --> 01:20:37,291
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Drew Campbell with 8-Bit from DDR Universe, the long version.

1164
01:20:51,934 --> 01:20:52,616
Thanks for watching!

1165
01:23:33,888 --> 01:23:34,569
Thanks for watching!

1166
01:24:17,665 --> 01:24:24,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming soon to DDR Universe, that was Drew Campbell with 8-Bit here on Orange Lounge Radio, the DDR Sneak Previews.

1167
01:24:24,847 --> 01:24:28,468
[SPEAKER_03]: And speaking of 8-Bit, we've been running a contest here on the program recently.

1168
01:24:28,989 --> 01:24:34,830
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Beat the Host, and it had to do with guessing the songs that we were playing from 8-Bit video games of the past.

1169
01:24:35,130 --> 01:24:37,751
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have one of the winners on the line with us tonight.

1170
01:24:37,871 --> 01:24:39,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello to DMN, everybody.

1171
01:24:39,672 --> 01:24:40,332
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing, DMN?

1172
01:24:41,448 --> 01:24:43,749
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to be listening to Edge of Control by John D. and Spesh.

1173
01:25:51,954 --> 01:25:52,655

1174
01:26:32,325 --> 01:26:34,846
DDR Sneak Peeks

1175
01:26:55,137 --> 01:26:58,038
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a remix of a song from the Echoing Green.

1176
01:26:58,438 --> 01:27:00,939
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is coming to us, I believe, from the A Different Drum license.

1177
01:27:01,279 --> 01:27:03,100
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's remixed by Echo Image.

1178
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:05,641
[SPEAKER_03]: So here it is from DDR Universe.

1179

Look into the sky, feel the wind blow Look into my eyes, there's a window

1182
01:28:47,378 --> 01:28:51,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Echoing Green, remixed by Echo Image here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1183
01:28:51,101 --> 01:28:54,624
[SPEAKER_03]: That is Heart with a View coming up to DDR Universe.

1184
01:28:55,164 --> 01:28:56,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, one more song for the previews tonight.

1185
01:28:56,926 --> 01:28:59,868
[SPEAKER_03]: This is another song coming to you on DDR Ultramix 4.

1186
01:29:00,549 --> 01:29:02,310
[SPEAKER_03]: It's by a group called Funk Police.

1187
01:29:02,951 --> 01:29:05,473
[SPEAKER_03]: This is The Problem here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1188
01:29:23,574 --> 01:29:24,836

01:29:58,915 --> 01:30:00,197
Thank you for watching!

1190
01:30:41,138 --> 01:30:48,481
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that was The Problem here on Orange Lounge Radio by Funk Police, and that's going to bring to a close our first wave of DDR sneak peeks.

1191
01:30:48,521 --> 01:30:56,345
[SPEAKER_03]: So to recap, tonight we had from Dance Dance Revolution Universe, we had Drew Campbell with 8-Bit, and then Echoing Green remixed by Echo Image.

1192
01:30:56,505 --> 01:30:58,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Heart with a View is the name of that song.

1193
01:30:58,506 --> 01:31:05,889
[SPEAKER_03]: And then from DDR Ultramix 4, we had The Problem by Funk Police, and before that we heard Edge of Control by Joni and Spesh.

1194
01:31:06,449 --> 01:31:07,510
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened to Loki's mic?

1195
01:31:07,530 --> 01:31:07,810
[SPEAKER_03]: It's somewhere.

1196
01:31:07,830 --> 01:31:07,990
[SPEAKER_03]: I ate it.

1197
01:31:36,483 --> 01:31:37,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Use this one in the meantime.

1198
01:31:39,305 --> 01:31:40,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody stole my microphone.

1199
01:31:41,047 --> 01:31:41,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there it is.

1200
01:31:41,828 --> 01:31:43,469
[SPEAKER_03]: It was by the donuts, you dumbass.

1201
01:31:45,030 --> 01:31:45,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn, those donuts.

1202
01:31:45,991 --> 01:31:48,113
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that the microphone snuck off to have some donuts.

1203
01:31:48,133 --> 01:31:48,453
[SPEAKER_03]: It was okay.

1204
01:31:48,653 --> 01:31:49,033
[SPEAKER_03]: I like them.

1205
01:31:49,994 --> 01:31:50,335
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1206
01:31:50,915 --> 01:31:51,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Good deal.

1207
01:31:51,516 --> 01:31:53,597
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have more for you guys here next week on Orange Lounge Radio.

1208
01:31:54,078 --> 01:31:57,921
[SPEAKER_03]: And that, I believe, is going to bring to a close Part A of our podcast.

1209
01:31:57,981 --> 01:32:02,525
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been quite a long half thanks to those previews, so we're going to take a quick break.

1210
01:32:03,205 --> 01:32:03,786
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back.

1211
01:32:05,027 --> 01:32:06,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get started again, lady.

1212
01:32:06,569 --> 01:32:10,292
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back a little later on with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
