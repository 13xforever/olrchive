487	19085	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
20629	25693	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 198 for this September the 3rd, 2006.
27094	31298	If you're listening to us on the podcast feed, remember that Orange Lounge Radio is distributed in two parts.
31398	37162	Part A rolls out Monday morning, and Part B rolls out somewhere between Tuesday and Wednesday, whenever we feel like it.
37843	42106	So you have to go back and listen to Part A to really get the full experience of what's going on tonight.
42447	46110	And what is going on tonight is that Loki and I have been partaking in a little bit of...
47030	48531	Alcohol, because this is a three-day weekend.
48571	50192	But please, drink responsibly.
50552	53474	Do not follow our example unless you are responsible, like we are.
53534	55375	We have Mikl Tov here, who's completely sober.
55715	56555	Our special guest tonight.
56615	56815	Yep.
57136	57816	Babysitting us.
58396	58596	Nope.
59597	61958	So go back to Part A and catch up on your Orange Lounge Radio.
62338	67081	And for now, we'll get back into the gaming news on this Part B. Loki, start it off.
69322	69562	Okay.
70203	72344	Anyways, to start things off...
73536	77719	Like I said in part A, I've been playing some Saints Row and got some good news.
77779	79440	There's new download content coming soon.
79800	90267	Now, this content, I'm not sure if it's going to be downloadable through live or through kiosks, because if you remember correctly, and this really hasn't been advertised too much, but
90847	100315	The demo kiosks that are in your Best Buys and GameStops and whatnot, they actually do have content you can download off of there onto a memory card.
100796	110244	So if you do happen to have one of the memory units for the 360, you might be able to get some good stuff, including some brand new outfits and clothing for your Saints Row characters.
110724	120247	including such wacky things like a samurai helmet, a leather eye patch, a fake tuxedo t-shirt, which is awesome, some tropical shirt.
120987	123708	Can you get a Moo Moo like you can in Dead Rising?
123748	125449	Because that is the best costume ever.
125869	127129	Possibly, but not yet at least.
127169	129890	You can get a spike leather jacket.
129910	130710	Who made Saints Row?
130730	131130	THQ?
131170	131691	Dear THQ,
133571	153687	MooMoo, please, thanks, LoveSky, OrangeLounge Anywho, you've also got leopard slash tiger skin boxers, leather chaps, crazy bunny slippers, a skull ring, a Saints Row medallion, and Saints Row wristband, as well as some tattoos.
153707	160072	They have a large and small panther, rattlesnake, biohazard sign, an ankh, and a spider.
161253	161413	So,
161820	162621	That's pretty sweet.
162842	166428	Apparently, you can get it pretty soon.
166489	171738	They've already got some screenshots of these things, including someone who's wearing all of them at the same time.
172239	172860	He looks like a freak.
174477	178779	Now, of course, some folks are noticing the Saints Row has a few problems with it.
179159	184982	Now, Volition, one of the developers of the game there, they are aware of the problems and they are working on a patch right now.
185022	186902	And these are things that are supposed to be in the patch.
187363	191864	Improvements to the way the game handles packet loss and bandwidth management between players.
192245	197847	This will address lag and general synchronization problems between the players' clients and so on.
198407	203149	The system for rating a player's quality of service has been improved and made less conservative.
203189	205850	This means you'll see many more matches with 10-12 player limits.
206610	216953	Fixed for the closed stealing exploit in multiplayer, fixed for widescreen formatting issues in certain resolutions, and changes to the matchmaking phase to get players in the game faster.
218014	220534	Kind of like that first Halo 2 patch did a lot of that.
220815	227757	That's good, because I know the multiplayer as it is right now, at least the game I played, was pretty unplayable.
228297	233039	You know, on my friends list on Xbox Live, Saints Row is easily the most popular game right now.
233219	235179	Nobody ever plays Final Fantasy XI on my friends list.
235500	237620	I've seen maybe one other person playing Enchanted Arms.
237740	238280	And you know what?
238481	238641	What?
238681	241061	And we do have a gang on Saints Row.
241221	242882	The OLL Army is there.
243482	245983	And all you need to do, it's pretty simple.
247003	248364	Let me know if you've got the game.
248824	252125	Send an invite if you're not a friend of Loki OLR already.
253246	255827	And basically what I'll do is I'll send an invite to join the gang.
256187	257067	And I've done that already.
258307	259647	There's a thread in our forums, right?
259667	260988	Yeah, there is a thread.
261048	264608	But even people, like I see them playing Saints Row, I'll send them an invite.
264648	266589	I'll jump in the game real quick and send an invite.
267009	269709	So, yeah, try that out.
269889	271690	I mean, I'm just trying to get some people to join up.
272650	280631	Obviously, we're not really going all hardcore at this, but I think later on down the line it would be fun to do a multiplayer game, maybe Deathmatch versus everyone.
280651	281451	It would be kind of fun.
281812	284012	I don't know, something to think about.
284625	285606	Fun game, though, multiplayer.
286186	286987	Yeah, I'm curious to check it out.
287007	291930	I notice other podcasters on my friends list are playing the hell out of this game, like GamerAndy.
292030	293691	I don't think I've seen playing anything else but this.
294612	297734	Godfrey from Gamertag has been playing a crap load of Saints Row.
297814	302757	So I think we need to form a gang and take some of those guys on in a multi-podcast tournament.
302957	306440	Hopefully it will work this time, unlike a certain Chrome House tournament.
306480	308321	This is my only stipulation.
308661	310322	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
328467	331309	If you don't have Saints Row yet, there might be some other games you can get soon.
331429	333351	There are some other games for the US.
333791	334972	Lots of stuff actually coming out.
335872	341697	This week, of course, if you're a NASCAR fan, you can look forward to it on the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and the PSP.
342597	351584	Also on those systems, well, not the PSP, but you're going to be getting Spy Hunter Nowhere to Run, which is kind of a classic remake of the old
352532	356133	Arcade Shooter Series, also which is supposed to be coming out as a movie later on.
356974	364977	For your 360 fans, Test Drive Unlimited is coming out as well as Xbox Live Arcade Unplugged Volume 1 will be also hitting the streets.
366457	376621	LocoRoco is coming out on the PSP this week and Yakuza on the PlayStation 2 is going to be coming out this week and those are going to be the big ones for this week.
377268	386753	and also of course next week the big thing is probably going to be LEGO Star Wars 2 as well as Rulerose which I hopefully look forward to talking to or about soon.
387494	390395	And yeah, that's pretty much it.
393117	394758	Did you have news about price drops too?
395358	396219	Ah yes, I did.
397339	399320	Lots of fun stuff getting price drops.
400061	404703	Actually, D3 announced this week that Naruto the
407270	407890	What was it?
408571	418018	The Game Boy Advance game, Ninja Council, is going to be added to the player choice lineup as well as... And they will pay you $5 to play their game.
418478	420079	Hey, that game wasn't that bad.
420099	421140	I'm just teasing, I'm teasing.
421160	421760	I don't think.
421780	422441	I mean, sheesh.
422941	425003	But, you know, they were getting added.
426092	428053	Come to the Dark Side Bismarck Server
454232	460980	And if you really can't wait for some FIFA action, FIFA World Cup 06 for the 360 has dropped down to $39.99 as well.
461601	463643	FIFA 07, of course, coming out in October.
463763	467188	So, not too far off, but... I still gotta wait.
468115	468655	DarkSakura
488647	489808	Maybe it was worth the wait.
490169	491490	Okay, probably not.
491550	496875	The only thing I don't like about the box art, no representation for the ServBot head.
496895	497596	That's true.
497636	500899	But the game is pretty hot, so you guys in Europe have been waiting long enough for it.
500939	502060	So you finally get it on the 8th.
502400	504622	Enchanted Arms is also coming out for you guys on the 8th.
505483	509067	Also coming out for you guys, Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins on the PSP.
509387	511048	I forgot that was also coming out this week here.
511289	513751	If you're a PC gamer, you have two games coming out.
514051	517712	Secret Files, Tunguska, and Warfront Turning Point.
517752	525435	Looking ahead to the week of the 15th on the PC, Call of Juarez, Faces of War, GTR 2, Broken Sword, The Angel of Death.
525775	532138	But if you're a little bit more of a console gamer, you do have Yakuza and NASCAR 07 to look forward to on the PlayStation 2.
532718	539921	And, should be pointed out, calendared right now for September 16th, Miku Tavio like this, UK finally getting Suikoden V.
541522	542443	I don't care about them.
543843	545004	Wow, you're polite.
545965	546285	Yeah.
546325	547386	Do you like Suikoden V?
547466	548606	Is it a good game in the series?
548866	554690	I think so, but I helped write it, so... Which means we have to make double fun of it!
554830	555931	Yay!
555951	560914	Gosh, I wish we could get the original Japanese version instead, because the English version sucks.
562315	563075	Nobody heard you.
563175	563695	Just kidding.
564856	565276	Anywho.
567117	569899	Speaking of things that suck and happen to be from Konami...
571809	574270	FunnyFungi, Stuntmant, and Daredevil
601294	602374	or Stuntman Daredevil.
602454	603775	That's okay.
603915	605355	I haven't heard those.
606115	618777	Anyways, it's got a 2-inch backlit TFT LCD display screen as well as some fun little white shell for it that's also lime green, magenta, and orange.
619277	623038	And we'll be able to be hooked up to your TV, kind of like a plug-and-play type of thing.
623058	628179	It's supposed to retail... Oh, and by the way, it does not come with the plug-and-play...
628939	629839	I really love you guys.
629939	632880	I mean, seriously, Castlevania, DDR, Contra, Silent Hill, Gods Among Games.
632900	633860	Even Suikoden's not that bad.
633980	634420	Gods Among Games.
634440	636321	But seriously, Konami...
653513	654635	Get over, Frogger.
655376	658621	Let the damn frog drown and be done with it.
659162	663108	Oh, by the way... Put those resources towards something else, I beg of you.
663809	664390	Please.
664631	666313	That is what the device looks like, by the way.
666333	667235	That looks like poop.
669440	673183	It looks like a cheap knockoff of the Game Boy Advance.
673263	675885	It looks kind of like a WonderSwan in a weird way.
676486	677046	I don't know, to me.
677186	679568	Maybe it's just the button layout kind of reminds me of WonderSwan.
679588	679949	I don't know.
679969	681270	Perhaps I'm crazy.
681310	682911	You know who you can really blame for this?
683031	685193	Pelican, because they're the one putting it out.
687334	688816	Yay, fun, fun.
689816	690737	Hooray, hooray.
690877	693339	Okay, look, moving on to other games.
693379	695221	I'm trying to see if there's any feedback in our chat room.
698198	706903	DarkTetsuya says, every effing Frogger game, he can't swim.
706944	708645	He's a frog for crying out loud.
709345	709805	Good point.
710246	712787	Jeremy Todd 1 says, let the frog get run over by a semi already.
713388	715830	That's our chat room, www.orangeonsradio.com.
715870	716370	Click on chat.
717913	718413	Interesting.
718453	724455	I am so excited about this port to the DS, or at least I was when I first read about it, and then I was a little bit disappointed.
725495	730377	One of the most underlooked Super Nintendo games of all time that was so great was SimCity on the Super Nintendo.
730957	744541	And yes, I know it was a PC game to begin with, and the PC game was awesome too, but the Super Nintendo version kind of added the cuteness factor to it that made the game very cool, although my favorite version of this game will always be the one that was on CD-ROM.
744801	745902	SimCity on the DS except then I read this
765157	766597	It's based on SimCity 3000.
767338	772379	And then I went, NO!
772659	774140	Because I hate SimCity 3000.
775900	778181	Like, nothing will never be as good as the original.
778841	779241	For me.
780202	781882	I like SimCity 4, it's really fun.
781982	785964	If you like SimCity 3000, then maybe you'll get a kick out of this SimCity DS.
786464	787904	It's got three main modes of play.
788004	790565	Build the City, Save the City, and Sister City.
791539	794702	Sister City Mode lets you chat with other players and trade landmarks.
795062	795863	So that's kind of cool.
796864	798806	Something to look forward to for you DS fans.
799666	806913	Anyways, one good thing for Nintendo is Tecmo is supporting the Wii's Virtual Console aggressively.
807794	808875	And what does this mean?
809135	813279	Well, it probably means that you're going to be able to play such wonderful games like Tecmo Bowl.
814265	814846	and stuff like that.
815186	821734	They have not said exactly which games are going to be supported on there, but it is going to be coming with lots of stuff.
822455	822915	That's great.
823035	827701	I like to see that they're supporting it and maybe we'll get some Ninja Gaiden stuff as well.
830828	832169	Alright, very cool.
833630	836792	Now I'd like to go to a story about the Wii, talking about the Wiimote.
837933	841875	Basically what's going on, there could be some production issues going on right now.
842235	849260	GoNintendo picked up a story that was going on about the Nintendo Wii, and there's a quote here on what's going on with the Wii production.
849900	855864	Quote, the factory has received Wii controllers purchasing order in its sample, but is still stuck in testing phase.
856274	866861	From feedbacks of testers, currently the Wiimote and Nunchuck still have a lot of small issues, such as the buttons not being sensitive, it's hard to press two buttons together, and no response occasionally.
867301	869202	Uh-oh, could this be a bad sign for the Wii?
869362	871323	I don't know, the thing felt fine to me at E3.
871423	873445	I don't know what this thing's talking about, but whatever.
873965	876366	Exactly, I mean, come on, they've already produced some already.
877187	879849	I don't see why, you know, it didn't seem that hard to play with at E3.
880769	880869	Yeah.
882657	883538	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
906135	907476	They should be able to get it right.
928986	934869	Well, we are going to go to the Skype line right now because I noticed we're getting a call in right now on the Skype line.
934889	936330	I definitely want to take this call.
936950	938311	Orange Lounge Radio, are you there?
939552	940592	I am, sort of.
940953	942153	Oh, is that Jamie?
942914	943514	Yes, it is.
943634	944274	Hi, Jamie.
944294	944795	How are you?
946175	947156	I'm doing okay.
947236	948997	It's been a very busy day.
949297	949617	Yeah?
949877	951818	What kinds of stuff have you been doing to celebrate your anniversary?
951878	954900	Happy anniversary, by the way, from all of us at Orange Lounge Radio and our chat room and all that.
955765	956265	Thank you.
956366	961229	Well, Friday, I came home, there were roses waiting for me, which made me all happy.
961790	963271	Because, you know, I am a girl.
963411	964732	I like girl things sometimes.
966314	966654	Right.
967475	971077	And we went out to eat at this place called Fats, which was me actually after we ate.
971798	975221	But no, it's this place in Roseville that's like an expensive Chinese place.
976499	983265	Actually, one of the people I met at Disneyland, who is also somebody I've been watching on DeviantArt, she worked at Disneyland until just recently and was going around putting those plushy snakes on different characters' heads.
1000996	1001836	It's in a journal.
1001876	1002457	It's funny.
1002837	1004037	She did, like, Snakes on a Hatter.
1004277	1006698	There's movie files of the Mad Hatter and Alice playing with snakes.
1006798	1010140	You know, it's been about, what, two weeks since you've been to Disneyland and you still haven't stopped talking about it?
1011100	1011760	I love Disneyland.
1012081	1012441	No, I know.
1012501	1012841	It's great.
1013121	1014141	Hey, how was your gaming week?
1014161	1015322	What kind of games have you been playing this week?
1016022	1017443	Actually, I just got done playing a game.
1017483	1019343	The newest addition to the pinball collection.
1019644	1019904	Uh-oh.
1019924	1020544	What'd you guys get?
1021424	1023145	Star Trek The Next Generation Pinball.
1023225	1024105	Dude, that's awesome.
1024165	1025326	That's a great pinball table.
1026147	1026548	It is.
1026688	1032696	And the thing about it, Dan got it for pretty much a steal, given that the machines go for, what, $3,000, $4,000?
1032756	1033537	He's in the bathroom.
1033557	1035460	Yeah, don't take the phone to the bathroom, please.
1039557	1048661	No, but we got it for a pretty good price, and it needs a lot of work to it, but it came with a bunch of extra ramps and stuff, and Dan's going to put some work into it.
1048681	1051002	I actually went ahead and played it, but we had the glass off.
1051402	1056084	Oh, my God, 10-mile issues are loud when they have no glass on them, so we were cheating and hitting the targets.
1057505	1058585	That is a little bit of cheating.
1058625	1059265	That's cool, though.
1059285	1062907	We were, like, throwing the ball at the Delta Quadrant ramp and everything.
1062967	1063567	It was really cool.
1064307	1065668	Did you play any console games at all?
1066744	1068285	You know, I have Enchanted Arms.
1068365	1071508	I haven't actually played it yet because I've been sort of busy with the whole anniversary thing.
1072329	1073550	And I played some Super Mario Brothers.
1073710	1076813	You need to play it before the next show because I want to know what you think of Makoto.
1078194	1079295	Okay, I will play it.
1079335	1080336	There's a gay guy in it.
1081196	1081737	Great.
1081977	1082918	Yeah, it's interesting.
1082938	1083699	That's all I have to say.
1084399	1085840	You know, that makes my inner hag happy.
1086121	1087242	Wait, you've been playing Super Mario Brothers?
1087262	1089764	Like the new Super Mario Brothers or the old one?
1089784	1090725	Yeah, I got one for free.
1091065	1091445	Oh, cool.
1091886	1092186	Very cool.
1093501	1094482	I've been giving it some play.
1094862	1098284	Did you have any news you wanted to share with the listeners tonight since you're not here?
1099765	1101345	Um, no.
1101846	1104067	Okay, I did release dates for you and we did mailbag.
1105067	1105648	Okay, cool.
1105708	1117854	I actually, I've been conversing with a few of our listeners being, I've been sort of, I looked into the box, I'll be honest, I thought that since you would check it for me, I was like, oh, I'll handle that tonight.
1119015	1119615	It's all good.
1120799	1123200	Have fun with your weekend off and all that fun stuff.
1124121	1127363	I will be there next weekend with a vengeance.
1127383	1127363	$199.
1127423	1127903	Can you believe it?
1127923	1128743	We're almost at episode 200.
1129224	1129744	It's crazy.
1130564	1130905	Oh, wow.
1130965	1131925	That's next week, isn't it?
1132105	1132426	I know.
1132726	1133366	Well, no.
1133386	1134227	$199 is next week and then $200.
1134627	1135187	That's the same.
1135207	1135887	$199 is next week.
1135927	1136148	Yep.
1136948	1137488	Craziness.
1139069	1140810	Anything else you want to share with the listeners, DarkSakura?
1142651	1142971	Yeah.
1143071	1143612	Give me a dollar.
1144392	1144732	All right.
1145293	1147394	Put it in the DarkSakura's next anniversary fund.
1147728	1147948	All right.
1147968	1150309	You can send those dollars to mailbag at OrangeScienceRadio.com.
1151029	1151370	Sound good?
1151390	1152270	Virtual dollars.
1152930	1153270	All right.
1153491	1154691	Yeah, you can draw pictures of dollars.
1154751	1155211	It'd be awesome.
1156092	1156372	Okay.
1156512	1157032	Yeah, okay.
1157092	1158213	New Photoshop contest.
1158373	1159553	Best dollar wins.
1159913	1165156	Actually, I think they're doing a Photoshop contest right now on OrangeScienceRadio.com of best Orange Science Radio fake news.
1165576	1166056	It's pretty funny.
1166076	1167096	I've been looking at that.
1167136	1168197	It was pretty hilarious.
1168397	1169477	I like the first one.
1169677	1170498	Yeah, it's pretty awesome.
1170518	1173159	It's all done like the old Death Cake logo.
1173479	1173939	It's great.
1174980	1175340	All right.
1176849	1178389	I guess that's it for now, DarkSakura.
1178409	1179150	We'll see you next week?
1179990	1180730	Yep, definitely.
1180790	1181351	Alright, take care.
1181411	1182411	Thanks for calling in.
1182431	1183391	The other people will hear me.
1184032	1184792	Alright, that works.
1185913	1187193	By the way, oh, I have to say, wait.
1187653	1188834	We've been drinking tonight.
1189674	1190074	Oh, God.
1190134	1191295	Do you condone this action?
1192155	1192796	I fully do.
1192836	1193936	I was drinking the other night.
1194236	1194536	Awesome.
1194556	1195757	I'm going to be drinking tonight.
1195957	1196877	Alright, sounds good.
1197018	1198218	Have fun, but not too much.
1199038	1200499	And by the way, I need to talk to you later.
1201339	1201700	Okay.
1202140	1202780	You know where to find me.
1202800	1204081	Okay, bye.
1204101	1204601	Alright, bye.
1207470	1211971	I like those, you know, totally personal messages in the middle of the show.
1212031	1212512	No, that's fine.
1212792	1213332	It was funny.
1214632	1227455	Nellie was talking about how she wanted to bring you Long Island iced tea because she remembered that one time that you were at the old apartment and you were trying to run up the wall because you had Long Island iced tea.
1227855	1228956	Yeah, I remember that.
1228996	1230236	It was a little bit crazy.
1231676	1231997	All right.
1232497	1232877	Anyways...
1234778	1238939	Some interesting stuff I'm speaking about, kind of running and flailing and stuff like that.
1239899	1244920	They're looking for testers for the Wii, and you're going to be doing a lot of flailing.
1245000	1251702	Apparently, there's some article posted on MTV News, and I'm sure they're the great source of gaming news.
1251782	1263825	But anyways, saying that they're going into more of the process of creating and testing the games, and some of the testers, for example, for Marvel Ultimate Alliance, that they...
1266235	1279640	You're actually doing a lot of flailing in order to perform some of the moves, because only the buttons are using for A to jump and stuff like that, but still, you've got to do a lot of gestures in order to actually be doing attacks and whatnot.
1280381	1289365	And that includes a lot of arm flailing and stuff like that, which should be interesting, because I can't imagine playing that four-player, staying next to your buddy or whatever, and swinging your arms around.
1289845	1290205	But, um,
1291061	1299828	The Wii is all the rage right now and folks can't wait to get their hands on that and I'm sure a lot of folks will be wanting to playtest it just to be able to say they played it early.
1318885	1325527	But one thing nobody seems to want to play is the Game Boy Micro, at least in the UK.
1325587	1329928	GAME, I'm not sure if it's an acronym for something, but I guess you could just call it GAME for short.
1330288	1335089	A UK retailer has sent the Game Boy Micros to the bargain bin.
1335489	1338689	They used to be 69 pounds, now they're running for just 39 pounds.
1338709	1338830	Ouch.
1341277	1342638	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1365411	1369892	I know that there's new colors coming to Japan, actually pretty much all the regions here pretty soon.
1369972	1372573	I know that we're getting here in the U.S.
1372613	1376654	the black and pink DS lights, which are going to be coming out I think on the 20th.
1395339	1397800	and then I know in the UK they're getting the pink one as well.
1397960	1401762	So, should be interesting with lots of different colors.
1401802	1403303	People seem to eat up that stuff.
1405164	1406645	It's just another color.
1407245	1411267	I don't understand why people are going nuts over this.
1411307	1414309	Of course, then again, I'm going to get the pink one, I think, and let's have a change of heart.
1414329	1417870	But that's just because I knew if I bought a white one, they would come out with new colors.
1417910	1418631	So I waited.
1419431	1421172	No, no, that's not what you're supposed to do.
1421192	1423313	You're supposed to go to EB or GameStop and
1423666	1443412	buy the system when it comes out in the color you don't want get the replacement plan then when the color does come out that you want put down the money for the reservation take your old system that you didn't like back say it didn't work then get your new color and then you still got money for your next replacement plan for the next color you want like I have
1444389	1445770	I'm going to get a blue one when it comes out.
1445930	1447612	Or maybe, I don't know.
1447732	1448873	What if those colors don't come out?
1448893	1449694	You're going to be screwed.
1449714	1450354	I'll have black.
1450374	1451655	That's better than the white one.
1451856	1454057	Or just pick a color and stick with it.
1454558	1454858	All right.
1455939	1463185	We're going to go to another segment now, and it's a segment that's returning because it was so popular a couple weeks ago that we're bringing it back.
1463986	1464487	Well, hello.
1465387	1466769	I just picked up a call there.
1466949	1468130	Hi, are you there on the phone?
1468669	1470469	Yeah, my microphone decided to die.
1470529	1471190	It's DMN.
1471230	1471570	What's up?
1471650	1472290	Hi, DMN.
1472310	1472870	How you doing?
1473430	1474990	I am doing fantastic.
1475031	1477171	I just splurged on a bunch of games.
1477231	1478371	I have Beatmania US.
1478391	1480212	I have a brand spanking new DS.
1480292	1481152	I am in a great mood.
1481512	1481972	Awesome.
1482032	1483212	Wow, you're set.
1484173	1484513	I am.
1484773	1486693	Well, we're bringing back an old segment tonight.
1486793	1487553	Actually, it's not that old.
1487593	1491654	We just did this for the first time a couple shows ago, and it was so friggin' popular.
1491694	1492695	We're bringing it back tonight.
1492755	1494015	It's called Beat the Host.
1494676	1501338	Now, DMN, you fucking always seem to get in on our Skype line, but we're okay with letting you play tonight because I know you didn't get to play last time.
1501658	1504019	So this will be the first time that you get to play this game, correct?
1504840	1505240	Correct.
1505560	1511342	Now, the prize we were going to give away tonight was another space on our MySpace Top 8, but gee, you already seem to have that.
1511682	1514663	So we'll have to come up with something more creative for you, DMN, if you win tonight.
1515183	1516444	Alright, and you know what?
1516624	1516904	What?
1517164	1518764	We're talking about Game Boy Micros.
1518824	1520565	If the host beats me, I'll give him mine.
1521793	1523196	Oh, snap!
1523656	1525399	Something on the line tonight.
1525599	1527161	Is that really a prize, though?
1527302	1529245	Because it's a Game Boy Micro.
1530888	1531188	All right.
1531448	1531909	You know what?
1531929	1532009	What?
1532029	1532889	Screw you.
1532969	1533429	I'll keep it.
1534050	1534430	All right.
1535010	1536271	Well, then you lose.
1536391	1538352	The gauntlet has been thrown, then.
1538392	1539813	This is going to be interesting tonight.
1539853	1541194	Okay, so some actual stuff.
1541474	1542794	Okay, DMN, this is what we'll do.
1543435	1553660	We will give you the same prize we gave the last guy, and you will get to help us with our Power Preview debuts, meaning you'll be the first in the world to know about some of these new tracks whenever we get to do them.
1553900	1554841	Okay.
1555121	1556062	Which hopefully should be soon.
1556422	1559363	All right, so anyway, who do you want to challenge tonight and beat the host?
1559403	1559984	Oh, first off...
1560992	1566136	I don't even know if I need to ask because you work for Nintendo, but how would you say your knowledge of 8-bit video game music is?
1567116	1567957	It's pretty decent.
1568097	1568758	Pretty decent?
1568958	1569918	All right, well, we'll see what happens.
1570139	1571780	He works for Nintendo?
1571800	1572260	Yeah, he does.
1572360	1572800	You didn't know that?
1573121	1573741	No, I didn't.
1573921	1575042	Because I came in late.
1575442	1576643	Who do I have to choose from?
1576903	1577784	All right, here's what you do.
1577864	1581827	First, I have to boot you from the chat room because you cannot have their help tonight in this game.
1581947	1582227	Sorry.
1582867	1588011	You can challenge either, and don't rejoin yet, you can challenge either Miklatov or Loki tonight.
1589922	1591644	Um, let's do it, Loki.
1591664	1593885	Um, let's do it, Loki.
1618547	1619228	Sounds like a plan.
1619288	1624212	So you can write him down as you go, whatever you want to do, but you only get 30 seconds to name him back, okay?
1624972	1625293	Alright.
1625413	1627294	Alright, now, chat room, you guys can play along.
1627875	1630777	Amiglatov, are you hurt that nobody ever picks you for this game?
1630997	1634500	Well, they're stupid for not picking me because I'm really bad at this stuff.
1634540	1635681	It's like an automatic win.
1635701	1640785	Well, but you basically shat on the prize that DMN was going to give you, so I wouldn't have picked you either.
1640805	1641206	Well, you know what?
1641286	1644788	I could have given him, I don't know, toenail clippings, and it would have been just as good.
1645706	1646166	You know what?
1646206	1648708	If they came with a certificate of authenticity, I'll take them.
1650249	1650409	Ew.
1650730	1652411	That's kind of gross, but you're on.
1652531	1654893	You might be able to get something like that from DDR Freak.
1655653	1655933	Alright.
1656854	1657334	Here we go.
1659636	1660016	Here it is.
1660056	1660757	You ready, DMN?
1661237	1661637	I'm ready.
1661718	1662398	Alright, here we go.
1662478	1663339	Here is the clip.
1663359	1663339	... ... ...
1695465	1696586	Thanks for watching!
1736321	1738423	Alright, 30 seconds to name them back.
1738623	1738943	Go.
1739664	1747150	Dragon Warrior, Excitebike, Adventure Solo, Gradient, Super Mario Bros.
1747170	1759761	2, Tetris, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2, God damn it.
1761539	1762401	No, it's not Turtles 1.
1762661	1763944	Uh, crap.
1764144	1765046	Is somebody helping you?
1765887	1766288	No!
1768031	1768552	Five seconds.
1769609	1772350	Um, um, OLR, the 8-bit game.
1772410	1773270	I don't fucking know anymore.
1773550	1774570	Alright, time's up.
1774650	1775110	You got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
1777651	1778211	You know what?
1778331	1779911	He would have beat me because I only got 3.
1780011	1781251	That's not bad.
1781311	1782532	Well, you don't know what the answers are yet.
1782952	1786072	Well, I got 3 that he got, so that means they're right.
1786092	1786513	Alright, fine.
1787053	1789013	You got 6, which is not a bad score.
1789413	1791574	And I think you will beat Loki with this, but let's see, okay?
1792034	1793874	Miklatov, if you'd be so kind, could you go get Loki?
1794654	1798515	I hate to take you away from the Final Fantasy XI Alakazam websites.
1799076	1799617	Whatever.
1799637	1800217	Whatever.
1821527	1825591	We had a lot of people calling in, but now DMN is saying he didn't get any.
1826071	1827432	So you should be in good shape.
1827472	1828073	You ready, Loki?
1828093	1830275	Well, that's all right, because I probably won't get any either.
1830375	1831536	Yeah, Loki's intoxicated.
1831816	1834058	Hey, I'm going to write him down this time.
1834118	1835459	All right, Loki, you know how it works.
1835479	1835820	You ready?
1835920	1836820	Pen and paper, the works?
1838081	1839443	I'm getting in the typing mode here.
1839583	1839783	Okay.
1840263	1840584	You ready?
1841805	1843466	30 seconds to name him back once it's played.
1843526	1844727	Here are your 10 songs.
1844867	1845508	Beat the host.
1849110	1849771	Oh God!
1877464	1879685	Hey shut up, we can hear you!
1918661	1921361	All right, Loki, you have 30 seconds to name them back.
1921421	1922682	On your mark, get set, go.
1923022	1924682	Friday the 13th, Tetris.
1924722	1925482	Yes, yes.
1925803	1926543	Excitebike.
1926603	1926863	Yes.
1926943	1927823	Bionic Commando.
1927863	1928123	Yes.
1928263	1929263	Super Mario 2.
1929403	1930744	Yes.
1931124	1933224	God, I want to say Super C. No.
1934045	1934465	Contra.
1934865	1935085	No.
1935465	1935745	Damn it.
1936765	1937365	Fuck, I don't know.
1937585	1938126	That's all I got.
1938146	1939006	That's it?
1939146	1939546	You sure?
1939586	1942207	You got 15 seconds to just randomly name games?
1943587	1943667	Uh...
1946195	1947476	DMN got 6, The Host has been beaten!
1970529	1973650	DMN, congratulations on your fabulous prize.
1973690	1976011	You'll be helping us with power previews whenever they actually happen.
1977031	1981353	Yeah, while I'm here, I should also say the Around the Horn thing has been completely scrapped.
1981413	1984735	However, I will be coming in when we get the Wii.
1985235	1987736	I will be coming to the studio and giving it away live.
1988196	1988756	Oh, crap.
1989477	1989957	Oh, snap.
1989997	1991578	He's going to give away a Wii live on air.
1991738	1992978	I'm going to bring a bat.
1995399	1997300	Or he's just going to beat up DMN because you don't like him.
1997648	1999209	No, I don't hate him at all.
1999629	2000750	I just want a free Wii.
2001010	2002751	DMN, I have to know, did you have outside help?
2002931	2004432	Because I heard you talking to somebody there.
2006033	2011717	I had somebody remembering my guesses, but in all honesty, he did not give me any single answer.
2011977	2013578	All right, all right, fine, fair enough.
2013998	2016700	All right, I'm sure you guys want to know what the correct answers were.
2016940	2018100	Charum did a really good job, though.
2018120	2021322	I think they got them all, but here they are for you guys listening on the podcast that we're playing along.
2021623	2022743	Did you beat the host tonight?
2022783	2023424	Let's find out.
2024945	2026205	Adventures of Lolo.
2026405	2026986	Duh.
2030984	2032385	Friday the 13th.
2034266	2035506	One of my favorite sleeper hits.
2035546	2038027	I don't care if that game got negative reviews, it's awesome.
2038067	2038588	Tetris!
2040649	2041569	That was an easy one.
2046511	2048072	River City Ransom.
2048412	2049173	God damn it.
2050493	2051934	This is the one I thought was Contra.
2052574	2054095	Oh, I would have thought it was the one coming up.
2054115	2056336	I thought it was some sort of freaking Konami game.
2056376	2056696	Excitebike!
2057016	2057877	Excitebike!
2061055	2063435	And that's like the only music in all of Excitebike is right there.
2064236	2065596	Bionic Commando.
2065616	2066956	I played this game so much.
2067076	2070137	That's the one that I completely forgot to say.
2070757	2072577	I would have thought you'd know that one, Loki.
2072717	2073797	I did.
2073877	2075098	Oh, my bad.
2075678	2076298	Oh, sorry, my bad.
2076318	2078058	Gradius, of course.
2079958	2081019	Dragon Warrior.
2082119	2087700	I don't think either of you guys got this one.
2087780	2088600	Double Dragons.
2089486	2090668	And lastly, you guys both got Super Mario Bros. 2.
2095038	2096919	I'm turning in my resignation to Nintendo.
2096939	2097679	That was pitiful.
2098180	2099260	Oh, no, you did fine.
2099300	2099480	It's hard.
2099500	2103302	Don't do that before you give me the free Wii that I'm going to beat you up for.
2105323	2119149	No, actually, I'm thinking later on at some point during the show, we're going to have like a take-home, beat-the-host type thing that you guys will have like a week to send in the correct answers and we'll give away something big like around Christmas time.
2119349	2123131	But they're going to be really fucking hard, like really fucking obscure games.
2127899	2130021	Alright, DMN, are you proud of beating the host tonight?
2131061	2134444	I am, seeing as I jumped in the show about 20 minutes ago.
2134704	2136125	Hey, it works.
2136745	2138807	Listening live any time, it ends up working out.
2139227	2141289	Anything else you want to share with our listeners before I hang up on you?
2143370	2149054	Happy anniversary, Jamie, and I'll see whoever's challenging me to Tetris in about 30 seconds.
2149334	2151096	Alright, have fun with the chatroom in Tetris.
2151196	2151636	Alright, take care.
2152316	2152577	Later.
2152797	2152997	Later.
2153985	2154465	That was fun.
2155806	2157467	I will honor the chat room's request.
2157547	2161609	Next time we do Beat the Host, we will do something maybe Sega games.
2161829	2167292	I know some folks want to challenge their Sega knowledge, especially against Jamie because that girl is scary with her Sega knowledge.
2167792	2170293	And maybe some other more current titles.
2170313	2172674	So that will probably be the last time we do 8-bit Nintendo for a little while.
2173254	2173755	So we'll see.
2173935	2178797	You need to do an all Mega Man one because there's so many different robot bosses and they all sound the same.
2178837	2180038	That might be one for the future.
2180078	2180398	We'll see.
2181149	2186474	Are you saying that you would be willing to... Yeah, but if you can just name out guesses, you can just go through all the Mega Man games.
2187815	2188095	Alright.
2188516	2192299	Well, maybe you'd have to actually only guess one per song.
2192679	2195702	Have a list that you have to fill out.
2197031	2200114	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2221267	2249331	Some new songs were announced for Guitar Hero 2 Nirvana with Heart Shaped Box Primus with John the Fisherman Stone Temple Pilots with Trippin' on a Hole in a Paper Heart That's an amazing song Anthrax with Mouth House Motley Crue with Shout at the Devil The Police with Message in a Bottle I think that's awesome The Pretenders with Tattooed Love Boys and get this Spinal Tap with Tonight I'm Gonna Rock You Tonight That is so awesome that they got Spinal Tap in the game
2250609	2253034	Where's Queen and Black Hole Sun?
2253956	2255158	Black Hole Sun would be great.
2255178	2257002	Rumor is Black Hole Sun is there.
2257062	2261792	There's some really weird rumor going around on the official Guitar Hero forums that involves
2262199	2265100	Like PlayStation 3 versions of the game and all this crazy shit.
2265420	2266020	So I don't know.
2266200	2266561	We'll see.
2266661	2268962	I don't want to have to like this stupid game.
2269242	2270642	Why do you hate Guitar Hero so much?
2270702	2271683	It's not fun.
2271843	2274203	I don't have a good time with it every time I've tried it.
2274343	2275144	I'm with you, Shane.
2275344	2280806	I'm like about this close to selling back my Guitar Hero and Guitar Hero controller.
2282507	2307778	but I'm almost like seeing okay maybe I should wait until this comes out I don't know because I figure I'm going to have to buy another one anyways for the 360 if it comes out so I might as well I don't know it's just now they're getting what Rush is pretty cool and getting Stone Temple Pilots makes me happy and we're running low on liquor so I'm running out boys and girls okie dokie goodbye hey
2308725	2310946	Let's talk about mashed potatoes again.
2310986	2312387	We can't talk about mashed potatoes.
2312747	2313167	Dang it.
2313327	2319290	We have to talk about Best Buy and talk about Bully and talk about stupid people having too much time on their hands.
2320030	2331595	So anyways, there are some oddly named protest group called the Pizzaholics that have staged a protest at a Best Buy outside of New York City.
2333876	2335337	And apparently...
2338182	2338923	It's really weird.
2339003	2344285	Apparently they're just protesting the game, saying that Rockstar is worse than terrorists.
2345586	2346186	Whatever.
2346306	2352108	I'm really tired of people protesting a game that they don't even know what the premise of the game is.
2353209	2358351	Or just how you actually play the game and whether it actually rewards bullying.
2358631	2362673	Because to be honest, from what I've seen in the game, it doesn't look like you are the bully.
2362753	2364274	It's kind of like you're being bullied.
2364824	2394297	you know, that type of thing I think it was something like you start out being bullied and then you become the bully later on but it doesn't matter because all they're protesting is that little image in the corner with the R and the star there for Rockstar I'm just tired of people protesting crap protest something else how about high gas prices or something I don't know but whatever they're protesting bully for now until the next Grand Theft Auto game comes out high gas prices doesn't corrupt your kids though okay
2395896	2396897	So, yeah, I don't know.
2397317	2397717	Should be good.
2400099	2400359	Hi.
2400680	2402161	Sorry, I was getting more drinks.
2402361	2403722	I brought you back more watermelon stuff.
2403902	2406504	Oh, but fuck, you didn't want more watermelon stuff, huh?
2407523	2407923	I'm sorry.
2408023	2408884	Whatever, I'm fine.
2408904	2409644	Are you going to drink it?
2409724	2410464	I don't want to go to waste.
2410484	2412665	There's starving children throughout the world who might want that drink.
2413126	2416347	Well, I'm not sure how much more I really want to drink this.
2416367	2417007	Do you want a straight?
2417047	2417688	Do you want the screwdriver?
2417708	2418988	No, I do not want the screwdriver.
2419248	2419789	I feel bad.
2419809	2421049	I will drink the watermelon stuff.
2421069	2427652	It's just that cup that you have it in was, I think, originally a candy dish, and it is like an over... It's been washed.
2428232	2431034	I know it's been washed, but it's an oversized mug.
2431094	2433275	It's like fucking huge is what it is.
2433295	2433935	It's fine.
2435202	2435963	Drink gets you a big wimp.
2436303	2437724	Am I up?
2438044	2438944	Is it my turn for a story?
2439465	2440085	It is your turn.
2440225	2440465	All right.
2440586	2441926	Is it the bully name change?
2441946	2442727	You guys didn't do that yet?
2442807	2443207	No, we haven't.
2443227	2443647	All right, good.
2443708	2446709	Then bully is getting a name change, but only in other countries.
2447210	2448811	And you just talked about bully, yes, Loki?
2448911	2449411	Yes, I did.
2449531	2450392	And the protests.
2450492	2452093	Did you see the YouTube thing?
2452637	2453518	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2474218	2477600	but maybe because Rockstar is a little bit afraid of all the controversy?
2478020	2484324	That might be a really good thing to do here is just kind of swap the name around and then people will go, I had no idea what you were talking about.
2485125	2487466	You know, Rockstar is kind of pussying out, I think.
2488127	2489067	Yeah, I agree.
2489468	2494391	I don't think they will change it here in America and I don't think that may be the reason they changed it in Europe.
2494911	2498393	Maybe, you know, they do name changes all the time with games in Europe for weird reasons.
2498453	2499174	It's not a big deal.
2499778	2501299	It is a pretty dumb name for the game.
2501399	2502660	I don't like that game either.
2503361	2506704	Anyways, there's some interesting news about Resident Evil for the Wii.
2507604	2512608	It's actually coming from Tara Platt, who is the voice actress for Jill Valentine.
2512668	2521015	She confirmed that the game will feature zombies, or zombie-like enemies, and plant creatures, as well as a wide variety of weaponry.
2521676	2529382	The fact that Mrs. Platt was aware of the weapons in the game infers that she's voicing a playable character and not just doing
2529898	2530499	A cameo.
2530599	2537064	It says Jill being the main character increases likelihood of seeing Carlos and Barry turn up as well.
2537664	2539305	That'd be kind of interesting.
2539325	2540907	Maybe they're remaking the first one or something.
2541127	2542027	I don't know.
2543068	2544610	Hopefully it's not a gun survivor game.
2545270	2547332	Because those kind of suck.
2548773	2550314	Are you looking forward to Resident Evil on the Wii?
2551235	2553296	I guess.
2553857	2556679	I found something else funny.
2556819	2557460	Because apparently...
2560464	2561865	She sent them an email.
2562505	2564046	I think this is coming from Kotaku here.
2564426	2574792	I sent them an email about saying that she's not allowed to verify information about Biohazard 5 or Resident Evil 5 in Japan or in the Wii game.
2575653	2576253	That's kind of funny.
2577354	2579975	It's like, oops, I slipped and then I take it all back.
2582177	2582497	Alright.
2582517	2583518	Um...
2584437	2589561	I have a quick story for you guys here regarding, also on the Wii, The Legend of Zelda.
2590342	2596107	And in a little, tiny little blip that IGN wrote earlier this week, they dropped an interesting little tidbit.
2596527	2606536	Twilight Princess will not only be bigger, a horse ride from one side of Hyrule to the next is rumored to take 45 real minutes to get from one side of the world to the other on a horse.
2606936	2610539	Of course, that's nothing compared to a chocobo ride around Final Fantasy XI, but
2611940	2612901	That's very true.
2613201	2614782	MMOs are supposed to be big, though.
2614822	2616643	That's still pretty impressive, you've got to admit.
2617244	2620546	You've got to imagine how long it's going to take you to walk, then, from the other side.
2620566	2622387	Horse will significantly increase the speed.
2622467	2626911	I'm thinking, obviously, at some point you'll be able to play an ocarina and be able to warp around.
2627131	2629152	Why do you think you have an ocarina?
2629252	2630493	Because you have to, it's Zelda.
2630653	2632274	No, they don't always have ocarinas.
2632314	2634296	They could have something else, a flute, something.
2634336	2640820	You know there's going to be a tornado that will wish you away, because they're not going to expect people to actually use 45 minutes to run from one side unless they're exploring.
2641021	2641581	Or do they?
2642332	2643852	Well, they'd be stupid if they did.
2644233	2648014	They made you do that crap in... What's that game?
2648054	2648574	Wind Waker.
2648594	2653255	We had to go and find the Triforce pieces and that was hours upon hours of pain.
2653435	2660718	Wind Waker was a little bit lame compared to the other Zeldas and that other god-awful 64 one.
2661238	2662098	Majora's Mask.
2662738	2663619	Don't even get me started.
2663879	2665719	To be honest, I kind of liked Wind Waker.
2666420	2666960	It's okay.
2667000	2667380	I don't know.
2667680	2669060	I would have rather seen that kind of
2671997	2688859	I guess, not Link's Awakening, but I don't know, one of the older Zelda's done kind of the same style as Wind Waker, but actually be for the GameCube in fully 3D and not for the DS with Wind Waker graphics type of crap.
2689340	2690321	So, anyways.
2691024	2696446	Anyways, speaking of stuff that's kind of crappy, live ads coming to video games.
2696526	2697326	Yes, that's right.
2697446	2709331	EA has signed a deal with two ad companies that will stream live advertisement into the brand new Need for Speed Carbon and, of course, the upcoming PC and probably next-gen game, Battlefield 2142.
2712932	2715154	Quite interesting that they're doing this.
2715214	2724360	I mean, they've also kind of run into a lot of controversy with, you know, gathering information about their users and whatnot for God knows what reasons.
2724420	2727923	Maybe now they're going to be gathering information about their users to advertise to them.
2728683	2729044	I don't know.
2729344	2733907	I think if I pay for a game, then why the fuck do I got to see advertisements in the game as well?
2734268	2740292	I mean, it's going to be kind of stupid when I'm playing around Battlefield 21, you know, 42, and all of a sudden there's a Toyota Yaris...
2741065	2743406	Funnydale says Orange Launch Radio needs to have ads in Saints Row
2772617	2773257	Oh, that'd be cool.
2773598	2774078	So what do you think?
2774098	2776299	You think this is the end of video games as we know it, or what?
2776319	2779921	Well, it's not the end, because, you know, I can ignore them just as easily as I ignore everything else.
2780261	2785584	At least they're not having, like, the Bird King King coming out and fucking, you know, walking around.
2785604	2786304	That would be awesome.
2786624	2794608	I still think, though, they should have made him a playable character in Fight Night Round 3, because that would have been fucking... I would have bought the game for... I would have bought Fight Night Round 3 just for that, too.
2794649	2795169	Just for that.
2796242	2798965	Just put the Muppets into the Fight Night engine, that would be awesome.
2799265	2819541	I mean, I gotta say, Rumble Roses, okay, true, that game was kind of shitty, but it was hilarious watching, I mean, getting to play the women beating up on each other was so funny, because, like, you know, I was able to give running commentary on the game, and I was just going like, ow, you just got kicked in the vagina, ow, you just got kicked in the vagina, and it was really funny, wasn't it, Miklatov?
2820709	2825710	No, because I had to work on that game and I don't find anything about that game funny anymore because it's obnoxious and annoying.
2825730	2827371	Can you tell us what you did on the game or is that secret?
2827831	2831391	Would you rather play Bomberman Act Zero or Rumble Roses XX?
2831932	2833272	I'd rather have my hands cut off.
2835012	2836133	No, I just worked on text.
2836193	2842494	Would you rather play Rumble Roses XX or not have a new sweet coding game ever again?
2845349	2850554	Um... If it ended on 5, that wouldn't be terrible, but... Alright, look.
2851876	2853737	Anything else you want to say on this topic, Loki?
2854378	2856960	You know, I gotta play through that damn game to get the achievements.
2857501	2858342	I really don't want to.
2859263	2860424	Our Skype line is open.

2884434	2884814	Who's this?
2885734	2886494	Raven Stolfen.
2886634	2887614	Hi, Raven Stolfen.
2887634	2888335	What's on your mind, buddy?
2889555	2891395	The PSP thing and the DS.
2891895	2892115	Uh-huh.
2893176	2896697	You speak on it very briefly and you said, what is wrong with porn?
2897117	2898077	I enjoy porn.
2898840	2899701	Grand Theft Auto.
2900181	2901702	I enjoy Super Mario Kart.
2904104	2909488	Right, so there's no need for a PSP versus DS war.
2909788	2910949	Can't we all just get along?
2911870	2913211	That's pretty much what I'm saying.
2914071	2915372	Everyone should just get along.
2915813	2920316	Okay, what do you think the PSP's strengths are and what do you think the DS's strengths are?
2921657	2926841	Well, I think the PSP's strengths are it's in the video games and video.
2927301	2928302	That's where the strength is.
2930740	2931020	Okay.
2932742	2948236	And it really does well with that, and the DS is, you know, DS is good for, like, porting games, right, with the touchscreen, and that's what the Wii is gonna be like, it's gonna be like touchscreen, I mean, not touchscreen, I mean with... A different way of interacting with the game.
2949617	2949957	Yeah.
2950678	2957704	Well, who knows, there are rumors that the DS could be used as a controller on the Wii, much like you could use a Game Boy Advance on the GameCube with that special little hookup.
2958303	2960484	So maybe there will be touchscreen Wii games in the future.
2960524	2960864	Who knows?
2962184	2966706	Whereas the PSP, you can only use as your rear-view mirror on the PlayStation 3.
2968026	2968966	That was funny, though.
2969646	2971707	No, in all seriousness, that is a pretty cool feature.
2971847	2972847	Expensive, but good.
2973988	2975788	I mean, I think of PSP a lot.
2975828	2984931	Wouldn't you think if the PSP didn't come along that they'll be like ports of Nintendo 64 games a lot more expensive?
2987194	2989935	Oh, run that by me again, because you're kind of cutting out a little bit.
2990915	2991795	Oh, okay.
2992915	3000157	It's like, if the PSP didn't come along, the Nintendo 64, of course, would be on the Nintendo DS.
3000397	3004977	Right, that's kind of what the Nintendo DS feels like to me, is the Nintendo 64 with touchscreen graphics.
3006078	3010058	Yeah, but if the PSP didn't come along, that would be like... Okay.
3010078	3010238	Okay.
3015186	3018127	and I thank PSP for that and for its innovation.
3018487	3018768	Okay.
3019188	3019608	I gotcha.
3019648	3021028	Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners?
3022349	3023950	My internet sucks tonight, Sky.
3023970	3025670	That's why I'm calling on my cell phone.
3026090	3026451	Alright.
3026751	3027671	Oh, it's a cell phone.
3027691	3030392	That answers the lie because it's a little bit fuzzy but that's alright.
3030752	3032193	We appreciate the phone call nevertheless.
3033473	3033714	Alright.
3033734	3034394	Thank you, Sky.
3034514	3035414	Have a good week, my friend.
3036295	3036575	You too.
3036595	3036655	Bye.
3036675	3037335	Until next time.
3038496	3039356	Let's go to the phones.
3039817	3042358	OrangeLaunchRadio.com, click on Interact With Us, or 916-226-9067.
3042618	3045419	Whoa, shit.
3045439	3046499	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3046519	3046939	Who's this?
3047640	3048480	Legend of Zaku.
3048660	3049561	Hello, my friend.
3049601	3050401	What's on your mind, buddy?
3051421	3062986	Basically, why is everyone getting their panties in a bunch about Bully, especially groups that think they know a lot about the game, yet they're protesting misinformation?
3063206	3067328	Because it's teaching the youth of America how to smoke, crack, and worship Satan.
3068326	3071727	Actually, Billy's teaching him about the right thing to do, fighting back.
3072487	3073348	Well, now, wait a minute.
3073368	3075749	That's debatable.
3075809	3078790	Look, every family can choose.
3078830	3081271	When you get pumped around, you fight back.
3081411	3083351	My parents didn't choose to raise me that way.
3083391	3085432	They didn't choose to raise me to fight back.
3085892	3087553	Did they raise you to use your words?
3087713	3090994	No, they raised me to go run and tell the principal and then sue him.
3091840	3092321	Wow.
3092441	3093143	No, I'm just kidding.
3093343	3094164	I'm just kidding.
3094505	3095747	But something along those lines.
3095787	3097130	You don't fight violence with violence.
3097631	3098492	Not in my household.
3098793	3104183	I sort of suspect that the pieces of comics are being manipulated by, you know, he who cannot be named.
3104223	3104464	All right.
3105491	3110015	Okay, well, needless to say, it's up to a parent how they want to raise their kids or whatever.
3110095	3110395	Fine.
3111716	3117380	And it should also be up to a parent how they want or what games they want their kids... Sorry, I've been drinking a little bit.
3117640	3119942	It's also up to a parent... That's fine.
3121023	3122184	Yeah, you're slurring too a little bit.
3122584	3124645	It's up to a parent... Shut up!
3124705	3125226	I'm trying to think!
3125886	3130189	It's also up to a parent how... God damn it.
3130890	3133392	It's up to a parent what games they want their kids to play, right?
3134915	3135556	Yeah, that's true.
3135676	3137418	That was my point.
3137758	3152374	They ultimately control what the kid actually plays, and that's where all the responsibility falls, not the government, not the right of the government to tell us how to live our lives to an extent.
3153596	3159859	Obviously, murder, stealing, and all that other stuff has to be regulated, but... Okay, well, now, wait a minute.
3159879	3161020	Now, here's another question for you.
3161040	3162040	What about freedom of speech?
3162180	3165922	These guys have a right... These guys have a right... Well, I'm defending these guys a little bit.
3165962	3166803	Just be a devil's advocate.
3167103	3172526	These guys have a right to protest just as we have the right to get on internet radio and call them stupid heads.
3173846	3177147	I respect that right, but I also have the right to criticize.
3177327	3180987	I'm trying to be very constructive in that I'm pointing out their fallacies.
3181047	3189389	Like the fact that they're saying that the FCC regulates the whole content rating, which actually the ESRB does.
3190689	3195570	And the fact that they're saying that Rockstar is a bunch of terrorists, that's just blown out of proportion.
3197630	3199030	Okay, I can agree with that.
3199090	3202411	What could these guys do better if they wouldn't get their point across?
3203041	3206343	Basically, they need to play the game and then criticize.
3206363	3210425	You don't criticize something that you don't know or haven't seen or haven't experienced.
3210985	3214347	And that's what people, you know, it's been done already in the past.
3214427	3221891	People have jumped the gun too quickly without knowing the whole side of the story and they just made up their mind already.
3222091	3222952	Yeah, you know what, guys?
3222992	3224773	Halo 3 fucking sucks.
3225033	3228195	I hate to tell you, but it's going to be the biggest letdown of the year.
3229096	3230177	It's a horrible game.
3230297	3233779	Live is so buggy, you guys, you wouldn't even believe.
3233799	3240725	Basically, it's just, you know, those people make up their mind without hearing the other side of the story.
3240765	3241465	They're fools.
3242146	3243347	They're just literally fools.
3243547	3254775	They're not that smart to actually, you know, they don't have the guts to actually experience the other side of the story and then make up their mind and what they want to stand for.
3254975	3257137	Alright, any other words you have for our listeners tonight?
3258310	3259291	That was pretty much it.
3259351	3261653	And just, you know, don't drink in 2DX.
3262534	3263354	Okay, I won't.
3263594	3265016	Bye.
3265076	3265556	Alright, man.
3268698	3270200	Don't drink in 2DX, okay?
3273102	3275744	The chatroom's yelling at me over that Halo 3 comment.
3275764	3277205	I was kidding, you guys.
3277505	3278646	It was a joke, in a way.
3278986	3280367	It was a bad joke, but it was a joke.
3281188	3282109	If that makes any sense at all.
3282618	3285000	We'll take one more call if anybody actually wants to call us.
3285320	3287782	Area code 916-226-9067.
3287842	3289383	Remember, kids, that may be a toll call.
3289723	3292905	We are too cheap to get an 800 number, or at least Skype doesn't offer them yet.
3293505	3295587	Or you can Skype us, username OrangeLoungeRadio.
3295607	3297188	But I'm noticing the phones are a little dead tonight.
3297628	3298489	It's a little weird for us.
3299249	3301351	We usually have, like, tons of people calling in, but not tonight.
3301371	3302191	It is a three-day weekend.
3302231	3304853	Everyone is kind of on vacation.
3305013	3307835	Out drinking at their local Labor Day barbecues.
3307895	3309076	Do you know what was going on?
3309937	3310297	Do you know what...
3311269	3311849	No, I don't know.
3311889	3315530	Do you know what was going on in town here locally tonight?
3315650	3315890	No.
3316410	3319511	And I'm here at this show instead of being at this event.
3320351	3323111	There's a big gay pride fest going on downtown.
3324452	3326912	They have Riken from The Amazing Race.
3327012	3327732	I know you love him.
3328312	3330493	And probably his boyfriend Lance Bass is there too.
3331613	3335074	Tiffany and Debbie Gibson on the same stage.
3335114	3336194	That sounds terrible.
3337998	3340100	Yeah, but you're a homophobic gay man.
3340240	3341462	That's true, but still terrible.
3341602	3343304	That's how I describe you to all my friends, Shane.
3343324	3344345	You're a homophobic gay man.
3344705	3345006	I know.
3345206	3345486	Alright.
3345907	3347148	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3347188	3348970	Who's better, Tiffany or Debbie Gibson?
3349771	3350231	Uh, me.
3351192	3351953	Hi, who's me?
3352934	3354075	Uh, me is Drunami.
3354115	3356358	Drunami, you didn't sing Electric Youth, okay?
3357362	3358723	I don't drink anymore.
3384332	3386833	You know, we have to respect his right to be sober.
3386893	3387293	It's fine.
3387313	3389354	Yeah, but we don't have to like it.
3389614	3392294	Somebody has to drive you to life after the show.
3392314	3393495	I'm just saying it to piss you off.
3393535	3394115	You do know that.
3394155	3395816	I haven't even fucking played Sucor.
3396996	3398576	I know, this is just like last time.
3398596	3400617	Did you call in to say anything intelligent?
3401017	3402878	Or did you just come on to fuck up the show?
3402978	3403818	That's what I want to know.
3404118	3405779	Yeah, I'm calling in to fuck up the show.
3406499	3408019	Then I'm hanging up on you, bitch!
3408099	3409660	Unless you have something intelligent to say.
3410541	3413583	Oh, uh, next time we do Beat the Hosts, I am so in.
3413963	3414684	I don't care!
3416865	3418607	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
3419587	3420848	Hello, this is Nintendo Maniac 64.
3421609	3423930	Hi, Nintendo Maniac 64, what's on your mind?
3424631	3428113	Um... I just berated the last caller, so I'm in an angry mode.
3428393	3430435	So you better have something good to say, what's on your mind?
3431175	3435638	Well, this is just a simple question, and I sent in... Okay, I can do questions.
3435678	3436378	...but nobody read it.
3437259	3439400	We might have read it, we just ignored it for now.
3439540	3440981	We might get into it next week.
3442102	3444943	Well, I guess we'll do your question, since you have a question.
3445324	3446464	What is your question?
3446985	3453328	Okay, I remember something about last year, where you mentioned something about an Ogvorbis stream.
3453849	3454869	Did that ever exist?
3454989	3455390	A what?
3456010	3457471	Like an Ogvorbis stream?
3458443	3468149	Oh, um, you know, okay, that would involve us getting off of Live 365, which right now, um, we have other options we're pursuing is all I can say right now.
3468289	3471031	So, oh, the OGG stream is a little bit on hold.
3471071	3472752	It was something we were exploring previously.
3473072	3478795	We do know it would give a little bit of a better sound than MP3 Pro, but, uh, um, we're just not going to do it at this time.
3478935	3479155	Why?
3479175	3480496	Is there something you want to say about OGG?
3480516	3485099	Well, it's just that I thought of it, and I'm like, wait, I know he said something about Augs Vorbis.
3485949	3487110	but I had no idea what.
3487451	3490353	So, okay, so it was supposed to be like a future idea or something?
3490593	3495458	Um, yes, but we have another future idea that's taking precedence and that's all I can say at this time.
3497320	3497580	Lame.
3498040	3498360	Sorry.
3498521	3500242	Do you have any comments on tonight's stories otherwise?
3501183	3501864	Uh, let's see.
3502324	3503645	I don't know.
3505026	3508530	Uh... Okay, I'm bored.
3508870	3509571	Um, let's go...
3512446	3515567	I need to drink more often because I get mean angry jokes.
3516707	3517307	I'm sorry.
3517467	3518968	I do love the callers.
3519788	3520608	I really do.
3523869	3527890	I think this is what every iTunes reviewer has always wanted us to do to the calls.
3528431	3529571	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3529591	3529991	Who's this?
3531311	3532312	Hello, this is Jaded.
3532752	3533332	Hi, Jaded.
3533352	3534172	What's on your mind, buddy?
3534192	3536873	Keep in mind I'm in a bad mood, so make it good.
3538713	3539514	Oh, nothing much.
3539534	3540034	I'm just...
3541010	3544791	I'm just reading all these DS reviews, I guess you could say.
3546132	3546492	What's up?
3546752	3547692	Like what DS reviews?
3548833	3549833	Pardon me?
3550213	3551293	You say DS reviews?
3552454	3553634	Yes, DS reviews.
3553834	3556295	Okay, what's on your mind with the DS reviews?
3556335	3561437	Actually, all these new products, or actually all these full products that I saw for the DS.
3561537	3563137	Wait, who's writing the DS reviews?
3563157	3565338	Because I want to know if I value their opinion or not.
3567364	3568765	Actually, they're not reviews.
3568805	3572087	They're just products that I think are pretty cool for the DS.
3572187	3573267	Alright, well, what are they?
3574528	3577930	Like, I found the DS Rumble Pack.
3579711	3582392	I also found the DS TV Tuner.
3584173	3586895	I also found the DS Memory Expansion.
3587035	3588335	Is this a website or something?
3590036	3594058	No, I just have a friend that's looking up random DS things.
3594939	3595199	Okay.
3595646	3596967	What, are you going to buy these, or what?
3599490	3600831	He's thinking about it, actually.
3601071	3601411	Okay.
3604654	3608578	On top of that, about your game, Beat the Host.
3609018	3609279	Yes.
3610360	3610920	Beat the Host.
3610960	3611801	We love Beat the Host.
3612702	3612982	Yes.
3613462	3616225	You want to get into some really odd boss stuff.
3616929	3619011	How about you do stuff from the Atari era?
3619251	3619751	Okay, look.
3620412	3625036	If you say it though, then everybody's prepared for it so it's not so offbeat.
3625576	3626077	You know what I mean?
3626397	3626617	True.
3627018	3630260	Okay, I do like the idea of Atari 2600 stuff, but here's the problem.
3630661	3637386	A lot of the folks that listen to our program are like 17 and weren't even a sperm yet when Atari 2600 was out.
3640979	3641420	Oh, okay.
3641700	3642260	So I don't know.
3642320	3645403	I mean, I guess we could, but I don't know.
3645943	3647885	Would you do an Atari 2600 beat the host?
3648765	3649286	Maybe.
3649346	3651547	I would probably get less right.
3651988	3654990	Well, here's the thing is a lot of Atari 2600 games didn't have music.
3655150	3657012	We will take it under consideration for the future.
3657712	3658193	How does that sound?
3659213	3659534	Pardon?
3660134	3663577	We will take it under consideration for the future.
3663637	3664317	How does that sound?
3665398	3666539	Yeah, that would sound pretty good.
3666639	3666959	All right.
3667820	3670162	The Atari 2600 games did have music.
3671050	3672451	Well, yeah, also you're forgetting the Atari 7800.
3691556	3703141	The Atari 800, the Atari 400 Wait, okay, now you're just getting crazy Because not that many people played those systems I mean, we could, I guess But then why don't I throw in VIC-20 games while we're at it?
3703181	3716267	Come on Okay, that would be a pretty good idea You need to throw in those Tiger Electronics Okay, but that's assuming that the host would be able to get any points at all We don't want to embarrass ourselves through this game
3718104	3720366	You have to cover all genres of games.
3720486	3721487	Alright, we'll think about it.
3721587	3723829	We're taking all your suggestions under consideration.
3723869	3724910	Thank you for your feedback.
3724950	3726092	Anything else you want to share with the listeners?
3727152	3727673	Um, no.
3728133	3729675	Alright, then that's it.
3730135	3733078	You're so mean.
3733739	3734479	I'm sorry.
3735080	3736281	Jaded's a good guy, too.
3736301	3737562	He really supports us.
3737662	3741646	I shouldn't have hung up on him, but I'm just feeling a little feisty tonight.
3742967	3743888	Should we do one more call?
3744707	3744747	PS3
3768680	3769280	Guess what?
3769560	3772801	You pay $600 for it, you get no HDMI cable.
3772921	3779322	So it sucks to be you hooking it up to a high-end media center or something like that.
3779402	3781023	So, yeah, whatever.
3781483	3784063	And then, of course, some other things.
3785344	3794586	Speaking, since you were talking about, well, they were talking about accessories for the DS, Europe is supposed to be seeing a DS MP3 player this October.
3795266	3796126	So that's kind of neat.
3797159	3802040	and supposedly it's going to be using the flash... What was that?
3802060	3804901	Just collect those SD memory cards.
3805481	3805701	All right.
3806101	3808442	We're getting another call on the skyline, so I'm going to go to that right now, okay?
3808742	3809202	Okie dokie.
3809262	3809502	All right.
3809542	3810543	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3810563	3810903	Who's this?
3813343	3813823	No one.
3814664	3815564	It's a crank call!
3816404	3816984	Crank call.
3817004	3817684	Okay.
3818305	3823006	And the last one I had, which was really cool, there's five games that...
3824301	3828107	are coming to Xbox Live Arcade from NVIDIA.
3828307	3830991	And you might know NVIDIA who happen to be...
3832586	3834948	They own the rights to the Sierra games.
3835288	3854465	So we're going to be getting wonderful games like Megaforce, which I never played, 3D Ultra Mini Golf, which was fucking awesome on the PC, and I used to play this online all the time, Red Baron, and two other games, one based on The Incredible Machine, and one based on the popular TV series Battlestar Galactica.
3855005	3858028	I am incredibly excited about The Incredible Machine game.
3858510	3860431	XBOX Live Arcade King's Quest, Space Quest, Leisure Suit Larry
3881770	3891700	bring me these games on a console yes I know I can get most to that stuff through GameTap and that's cool but you know I played those games on a computer before I want to do something on a console I want
3892358	3895080	Achievement Points for King's Quest 4.
3895661	3896882	Is that too much to ask?
3897482	3898623	You want to know something funny?
3898683	3900524	This is just purely observational.
3901565	3906589	GamersReports.com You know how they have banner ads on websites and stuff like that?
3907049	3910252	This one has a banner ad for a London escort service.
3910632	3911953	I just thought that was kind of funny.
3912674	3914876	Because they have escorts on a gaming news site.
3915556	3915896	I don't know.
3916757	3917838	I'm easily amused tonight.
3919039	3919459	Yeah, I know.
3919539	3919619	I'm...
3922268	3925110	Oh yeah, and there's rumors about Rez coming to the Wii.
3925750	3926130	Oh yeah?
3926150	3927611	That would be kind of cool.
3928051	3930412	Yeah, I don't know if that's really anything, you know.
3931513	3937316	I don't know if they've actually got info to back that up, but it's probably one of those, yeah, that would be cool to, you know.
3938956	3940377	I'm seriously considering it.
3940417	3943319	Yeah, that was the quote here.
3943799	3945980	I'm currently seriously considering it.
3946400	3947301	It's always been there.
3947521	3949662	I'm always thinking about it.
3950322	3951283	Also, Space Channel 5.
3953895	3956118	Yes, Space Channel 5 is so awesome.
3956838	3957579	I love that game.
3958520	3960642	Space Channel 5 on the Wii?
3960662	3962184	Can you imagine that?
3962224	3965567	Where you'd have to do the motions for the different dances and stuff?
3965928	3966228	Chew!
3966688	3967069	Chew!
3967690	3969111	So you'd be doing the dances too?
3969451	3970052	That'd be kind of funny.
3971333	3971573	Alright.
3972234	3972534	Anything else?
3973475	3973956	That's it.
3974358	3977060	That's going to bring our show to a close then for this evening.
3977721	3980203	I'd like to go around and get everybody's final thought.
3980243	3982565	Thank you guys, by the way, for tuning in and supporting Independent Radio.
3982605	3987829	I know we were a little crazy tonight and, you know, we appreciate you guys sticking by us no matter what.
3987889	3990651	Miklatov, thank you for being here even though you barely ever talked at all.
3991331	3992072	I'm reading.
3992412	3993053	What are you reading?
3993113	3993673	What's more important?
3993693	3996055	You're chatting on Instant Messenger, at least be honest.
3997036	3998577	I'm also reading about Blue Maze.
3998597	4000118	Who are you chatting with on Instant Messenger?
4000379	4003381	Jazz and, god, I don't remember his name on DDR Freak and that
4004093	4010017	Makes me angry, but the guy that sent us, or that sent the cookies for Ultramix 2.
4010157	4010257	Oh!
4010277	4015920	I only know him by his real name now, I don't remember his... I know his name on Xbox Live, but I can't... El Mullet!
4016360	4018402	El Mullet, yes, I'm talking to El Mullet.
4019662	4020303	How's he doing?
4020683	4021643	I haven't heard from him in a while.
4021663	4022624	Does he still listen to the show?
4022644	4023785	I have no idea, because I didn't ask him.
4023805	4024645	Ask him if he's listening.
4025085	4026266	I'll maybe do that later.
4026566	4026947	Fine.
4027327	4029008	We're talking about Dance Factory right now.
4029028	4029368	Alright, fine.
4029810	4031291	Yeah, that game came out last week.
4031431	4034193	Yeah, and it's pretty stupid from what I understand, but it's getting good scores.
4034353	4035534	It is getting good scores.
4035554	4036415	You know what the scores are?
4036655	4038617	Well, because then you can put any song in it.
4038737	4041219	Yeah, but all those dance steps are probably crap.
4041239	4042900	Yeah, and off-sync apparently.
4043280	4047563	And it's eye-toily mode doesn't work, I guess, which makes it equally cool.
4047643	4052247	You know, they have a bundle with a really crappy dance pad coming out in October.
4052887	4053468	I thought that was funny.
4053488	4054869	That's something I'll be skipping.
4057042	4059924	You know what game they should put out over here that's coming out in the UK?
4061064	4061504	B-Boy.
4061925	4062785	That looked pretty cool.
4063405	4065066	I vaguely remember that.
4065567	4068048	It's like a breakdancing game.
4068188	4069168	But it's not DDR.
4069209	4072230	It's kind of like a Bust the Move.
4073211	4074731	I would love that, actually.
4074771	4076612	That would be a great thing.
4077053	4077853	And you know what they need?
4078573	4078954	What was it?
4081304	4081744	X-Tango
4106030	4106671	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4130680	4136323	If you guys can see this right now, it's the stupidest thing ever.
4136363	4138184	You can't go out in public if you're like this.
4138305	4138985	No, I can.
4139045	4144048	I want to go meet your boyfriend at Taco Bell that we were talking about during the live bonus segment tonight.
4144168	4145369	He's totally not working now.
4145389	4146569	Alright, we really have to end the show.
4146830	4147750	Final thought, Miklotop.
4147770	4148330	Thank you for being here.
4148410	4149391	I'm really hungry.
4150452	4151292	Loki, your final thought.
4152093	4154034	I want to play more Saints Row tomorrow.
4154094	4157416	My final thought is I'm really sorry for making a mess of myself tonight, and...
4158266	4160027	Also, I'm sorry to the callers I hung up on.
4160047	4161287	I'm really not that mean usually.
4161307	4166048	Stock salt here and I'll be able to get more drunk next time because I can drink faster that way.
4167008	4170249	Alright, thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting Independent Radio.
4170289	4171250	You guys are awesome.
4171310	4173950	Next week on the program it is episode number 199.
4174010	4176191	We're hoping to have a good interview for you next week.
4176551	4181012	Otherwise, we'll be saving all the good stuff for episode number 200, which is just around the corner.
4182033	4186734	Hopefully, I don't know for sure yet, but it looks like the Power Previews may be back next week.
4187150	4200358	so it's definitely incentive for you guys to listen live if you're not already so we'll see you next week thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening have a great week and don't drink and drive, it's bad have a good night
