15480	20120	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20120	26320	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 199 for this September the 10th of
26320	27320	2006.
27320	30080	And yes, I know people have been asking, what are you guys going to do for episode number
30080	31080	200?
31080	32800	And the answer is, we're not quite sure yet.
32800	35160	We're just going to do our thing and see what happens.
35160	37260	But it'll be a fun show next week, nevertheless.
37260	42040	So we hope you'll be back to join us live Sunday, September 17th, 2006 for episode 200.
42040	43760	And if you can't join us live, there's always a podcast.
43760	45000	I know what we'll be talking about.
45000	46000	What's that?
46000	49120	We'll be talking about the Wii, because the official announcement's going to be happening,
49120	50120	what, this Thursday?
50120	53480	I bet Nintendo planned it that way.
53480	54640	They knew.
54640	55960	They did it just for us.
55960	59440	It's for you, O.L.R.
59440	67080	I want Reggie to come out on stage with his 40 and go, this one's for O.L.R., my bitches.
67080	70000	I am nobody's bitch.
70000	72320	I will, however, whore myself out for, no.
72320	75160	Yeah, but who needs a Nintendo press conference to have Wii News?
75160	76160	Exactly.
76160	77340	You don't need Wii News.
77340	82800	You can do what some sites did and tell people, hey, guess what, we got big freaking news
82800	86280	coming at 12 o'clock in the morning.
86280	90920	And then you find out, guess what, it's something that we pretty much already knew, that the
90920	96240	Wii chips were well under production, but IBM came out and confirmed that, that it's
96240	99600	been in production since the beginning of this quarter.
99600	105360	And for those of you who are not savvy in the calendar, that means July.
105360	111400	And so that the actual first shipments of the chips are in Nintendo's hands and that
111400	114240	the Wii is well underway for launch.
114240	117920	Whenever that is, of course, we'll know that in a few days.
117920	119000	November though, right?
119000	120000	We know that for sure.
120000	125280	Well, yeah, it's November, but you know, I'm still not, you never know, they could just
125280	132160	come and say, you've been punked, it's fucking, it's coming out tomorrow, as long as we're
132160	134600	not juiced, I'm okay with that.
134600	140240	So all right, it's fine.
140240	144640	To the site's credit, you know, I know the hype machine got way out of control, but they
144640	147640	didn't know that people were going to run it on dig and all this crazy stuff.
147640	149800	I mean, people went wild with this.
149800	153720	There's going to be news soon, you know, heck, we already told you guys the Wii is coming
153720	154720	out soon.
154720	155720	Exactly.
155720	160620	Anyway, all right, well, definitely one thing that will be coming to the Wii that is a little
160620	164960	bit of a surprise, not usually the type of game you think about when you think about
164960	170200	Nintendo, at least I don't, but Splinter Cell Double Agent does appear that it's going to
170200	173640	be a launch title, at least that's what IGN reported earlier this week.
173640	178280	The Wii version, Splinter Cell Double Agent, was based on the PlayStation 2 and GameCube
178280	183280	builds, and it will fully utilize the unique control system that the Wii has.
183280	187040	Of course, nothing specific has been given on the control system yet, but I'm sure we
187040	191440	will know more as time moves on.
191440	194880	Examples that have been giving us possible ideas that the Wiimote could be used to like
194880	197520	pick locks, you know, cute little things like that.
197520	200440	So that should be fun for those of you guys that are into the Splinter Cell series.
200440	201440	Toss them in.
201440	206320	If you do have a Wii and you just don't want that, you know, finicky controls and stuff
206320	209280	from the Wii version, you can just get the GameCube version.
209280	210520	Sounds good to me.
210520	218400	Well, speaking of things that are coming out that sounded wrong, how about our UK release
218400	219400	date?
219400	221120	I have an announcement, never mind.
221120	223400	I have an announcement to make.
223400	225960	You are a horror.
225960	226960	What?
226960	231920	I am really fond of burritos.
231920	233400	You're burrito-sexual, huh?
233400	234400	I'm burrito-sexual.
234400	235400	That's hot.
235400	236400	All right.
236400	237400	No, really.
237400	238400	I, uh, no.
238400	239400	Maybe one day.
239400	240400	Anyway, release dates.
240400	241400	How about that?
241400	250760	On the 11th in the UK, we have Lego Star Wars II, the opening, the original trilogy coming
250760	252880	up for everything.
252880	254080	And I'm not kidding.
254080	255840	It's coming up for everything, except for PC.
255840	256840	No, even PC.
256840	259560	It's coming up for everything.
259560	262280	And then, um, that's it.
262280	264480	I'm serious.
264480	267560	I'm looking at that and it's all the 11th.
267560	268880	I hope you're a Star Wars fan.
268880	269880	Okay, I'm kidding.
269880	272300	There's actually a bunch of stuff on the 15th, too.
272300	277300	We have 50 Cent Bulletproof on PSP, Ace Combat Zero, The Belkan War, Broken Sword, The Angel
277300	286320	of Death, Call of Juarez, Faces of War, GTR 2, Joint Task Force, NASCAR 07, yay, Night
286320	293160	Watch, Passport 2, dot dot dot, Prostroke Golf, I love that name, Prostroke, Golf World
293160	302060	Tour 2007, Rome Total War Alexander, Secret Files Tunguska, Steam Bot Chronicles, Super
302060	308400	Bike Racing Challenge, Tekken Dark Resurrection, which I have and it's freaking rad, and Yakuza
308400	311200	on the 16,000 getting Suikoden V.
311200	312200	Hmm, sweet.
312200	314180	That's a pretty good line up there.
314180	318440	I just want to share this real quick from chat, SSJ100Matt says, the Wii rumors are
318440	320240	like the U.S. terror threat.
320240	322720	We don't know when it will happen, but it will happen soon.
322720	325280	That's a good analogy.
325280	329800	If you want to join our chat room and get funny little gems like that, it's orangeontrated.com.
329800	330800	Click on chat.
330800	331800	Bravo to you.
331800	334320	Anywho, the U.S. is getting quite a slate of games.
334320	339060	Of course, they are also getting Lego Star Wars 2, the original trilogy.
339060	347960	Some stuff also coming out, we've got of course, The Good Bummer Man on PSP, Mario Hoops 3
347960	356240	on 1 for the DS, Cookie Mama also for the DS, Godfather on the 360 and then Godfather
356240	363400	Mob Wars on the PSP, King of Fighters 2006 is coming out on Playstation 2, Mega Man ZX
363400	365400	on the DS.
365400	372360	If you're a hockey fan, NHL 07 coming out on Playstation 2, Xbox, the 360 and PSP and
372360	378920	also NHL 2K7 coming out on Playstation 2, Xbox and 360.
378920	383800	We've got Rengoku 2 coming out on the PSP, crap.
383800	388860	And One Piece Pirates Carnival on the Playstation 2 and GameCube.
388860	393140	And of course, the game we were talking about earlier, Rule of Rose will be making its way
393140	396400	on to Playstation 2.
396400	402280	And if you have a Game Boy Advance and are looking for something to play, how about Super
402280	409360	Robot Tyson, the original generation for Game Boy Advance.
409360	414360	By popular demand, we are going to add a new segment to this release date bonanza because
414360	418220	I'm feeling left out because I usually don't have release dates to report on.
418220	421360	So we're going to add Japanese release dates now.
421360	427320	So here you go, coming out September 12th in Japan, Metal Slug 6 and Minna no Tennis,
427320	428880	which is everybody's tennis.
428880	432080	Coming out September 14th, which is the much bigger release day over there in Japan, you
432080	435320	have Cluster Edge coming out from Marvelous Entertainment.
435320	436320	You have G.I.
436320	442960	Jockey 3 and 4 by Koe, everybody's tennis also coming out there for the Sony.
442960	451600	And let's see, we have Simple 2000 series volume 106, 107, and 108, Winning Post 6 coming
451600	457440	out also from Koe, and Neon Genesis Evangelion.
457440	458680	I said it, didn't I?
458680	459680	Yes, you did.
459680	462360	Kotsetsu no Girlfriend Special Edition.
462360	465400	Another Eva dating sim, what the hell?
465400	467560	That's coming out September 15th.
467560	468640	No, no, no, no.
468640	470840	I have one of the Evangelion dating sims.
470840	480800	I have one of the ones on Saturn, and they're dating sims with combat sequences.
480800	481800	That's all I got.
481800	483520	I did, however, get to End the World.
483520	484520	It was fantastic.
484520	486160	That's all I got for you guys this week.
486160	489120	You know what I need to borrow for the Saturn?
489120	491520	I need to borrow a stall.
491520	492620	That game was awesome.
492620	493620	I love that.
493620	496960	I have a stall.
496960	503440	Anyway, speaking of good games, because I saw it was freaking rad, and this will interest
503440	510880	Chris, Kingdom Hearts 2 is eventually coming out in the UK.
510880	511880	Wee!
511880	516800	No, dear, the wee is not out yet.
516800	520480	That suddenly made me think of Mitch Hedberg, who's like, Wee!
520480	523400	When you're having fun, you mention yourself and other people.
523400	524400	Wee!
524400	529960	Uh, Kingdom Hearts 2 is on its way to Europe very soon.
529960	530960	You will like it.
530960	531960	It's cute.
531960	532960	It really is.
532960	533960	Axel!
533960	534960	Axel!
534960	538400	I think we've got it memorized by now.
538400	539400	Haha.
539400	542960	They don't get that yet unless they imported it.
542960	543960	They will.
543960	544960	Believe me.
544960	545960	They will.
545960	550000	Okay, back to the news before it's really interrupted by Mr. Junami in the corner.
550000	552000	Go eat a donut.
552000	558200	Well, yeah, but there's a difference between you're helping and Junami helping.
558200	560480	That's because I always forgive you because you're cute.
560480	562320	Anyway, she just watched a movie.
562320	563560	And I'm not?
563560	565120	Back to the news, hello.
565120	566120	You're a boy.
566120	567120	Okay, okay.
567120	568120	Yeah, you're a boy.
568120	569120	You don't count.
569120	570120	Who?
570120	577520	Anyway, to our friends in the UK, it will actually be coming out on September 29th.
577520	584320	It actually came out last December in Japan and we got it this year a few months ago.
584320	587380	But honestly, get the game.
587380	588920	When it is out, get it.
588920	591160	It's fantastic.
591160	592160	Lots of great gameplay.
592160	596500	In fact, I actually, but make sure that you do Agrabah and the Pride Lands.
596500	600880	Make sure that you do them because Jamie decided she was going to skip those two places and
600880	602680	now can't get back to them.
602680	604640	AKA you fucked yourself.
604640	607680	I did, so I have to start over from Dan's game because he's right where I am only.
607680	608680	He did those two parts.
608680	609680	Winner.
609680	612680	Who the hell skips areas?
612680	616040	I thought that I was going the right way.
616040	617360	It gave me a choice.
617360	619760	I chose the one I wanted to do pirates and I wanted to do pirates.
619760	620760	You chose wrong.
620760	624960	Hey, I wanted to do pirates in Halloweentown, so you shut up, sir.
624960	627120	Pirates is another great idea.
627120	628120	The pirate version?
628120	633020	I mean, it's really cool just like, hey, it's pirates, but in all honesty, it's not one
633020	635740	of the best areas you can go to.
635740	641200	I wanted to see it because I am a Captain Jack Sparrow fangirl.
641200	643600	It is also about Dreamboat Barbie.
643600	645160	Barboza.
645160	651720	OK, that came from when we were writing Pirates of the Caribbean the second time through when
651720	654840	we were singing with the whole ride, annoying the people in front of us.
654840	659080	And as a and then Barboza's up on the Wicked Wench.
659080	662080	So we decided to call him Dreamboat Barbie.
662080	673040	OK, anyway, guys, get the game September 20th, 29th, you will not be disappointed anyway.
673040	688040	And Rob, you anyway, and as far as also other stuff, OK, these people are giggling and driving
688040	689040	me nuts.
689040	690040	OK.
690040	695960	So Liberty Stories, Grand Theft Auto by City Stories will not be going out until November
695960	696960	in the UK.
696960	703920	It was supposed to be out October 20th, but now it's been pushed back to November 3rd.
703920	707240	That's also another good game if you're into the GTA series, it actually is a really good
707240	708240	addition to PSP.
708240	710720	My man's been pretty happy with it.
710720	713640	And it's also delayed in the United States, too.
713640	714640	November 1st.
714640	715640	What?
715640	717280	No, I was referring to Liberty City Stories.
717280	719240	Oh, is that?
719240	721400	Is that was the story about Liberty City or?
721400	722400	Oh, OK.
722400	726320	I mean, if it's anything like Liberty Series.
726320	727760	You were about to say Liberty Shitty.
727760	728760	I think you were.
728760	729760	No.
729760	730760	Hey, it's my game, bitch.
730760	735720	I'm saying if it was anything like Liberty City Stories, because Dan was playing that
735720	741260	game all the time, keeping me awake here.
741260	745220	I'm not a big fan of Grand Theft Auto, like, you know, I understand why it's so freaking
745220	749220	amazingly popular, but I think I might actually get suckered into playing Saints Row because
749220	754720	as we've all found out, I easily succumb to peer pressure, hence why I'm playing Final
754720	755720	Fantasy XI again.
755720	757280	So we'll probably go to Saints Row, too.
757280	760280	It's a fun casual game, where you casually beat lookers.
760280	761280	I like casual.
761280	763280	I like beating lookers.
763280	768440	Anyways, so, yeah, delayed in the United States till November 1st.
768440	771040	That sucks because I was really looking forward to playing that in October.
771040	773440	Oh, this is going to play some more Liberty City Stories.
773440	775880	Speaking of delays, Forza 2.
775880	781560	It's been rumored to be delayed to 2007, and this is coming straight from the development
781560	788640	team, and it says, I think, their quote is, I think we've always said that it will appear
788640	794800	in our fiscal year, and in our fiscal year I can guarantee that the game will appear.
794800	799280	I can't be specific right now in terms of the actual day of Forza, but certainly it
799280	806920	will be an integral game that appears in our financial year of 07, which is the one we're
806920	807920	in now.
807920	813320	So, it's rumored, let me put it this way, it's not coming out when it was supposed to,
813320	818080	because this is straight, you know, I actually, when I saw this story, I, you know, called
818080	822940	my Microsoft rep and asked them when the fuck this game is coming out, and it's to be announced
822940	823940	right now.
823940	828580	It was in November, I think the 15th, and now it's being pushed back even further.
828580	833480	So we're supposed to know the official date in a couple weeks, so that should be interesting.
833480	838440	What was the other game I was going to mention, Crackdown, was another game that was slated
838440	844660	for the end of, or actually middle of October, and that's been delayed to be announced now.
844660	850400	So now the only Microsoft game coming out in October, Fusion Frenzy 2.
850400	854660	Speaking of delays on the Xbox, if you were the one person that was looking forward to
854660	860520	Scramble coming onto Xbox Live Arcade this week, sorry, but you have to wait one more
860520	865320	week because there was some last minute things that had to be cleaned up with Scramble, and
865320	869320	it's now going to be released this week, probably by the time you hear this podcast, it's already
869320	870320	on the marketplace.
870320	873320	For those of you folks listening live, it'll be out this Wednesday.
873320	877720	So you know, Microsoft has this big Xbox Live Arcade promotion thing going on where they're
877720	881480	trying to release new stuff every Wednesday, so they had to put something out this Wednesday,
881480	883600	so what did we get instead of Scramble?
883600	896480	We got a brand new Uno deck, featuring cards from Project Gotham Racing 3, for 100 points.
896480	900040	I bet less people will be buying this than Scramble.
900040	903600	Well I don't know, actually there's a lot of Uno horse out there, some people pretty
903600	909200	hardcore their Unos, so I don't know, I'm not a big Scramble fan, I don't know why that
909200	913040	one of all games is being ported over to Xbox Live, maybe I just don't remember the game
913040	916300	very well, I'll check out the demo, but I don't know if I'm going to spend the five
916300	920640	bucks on the game, it's a little, yeah, we'll see.
920640	923600	Well you know, at least they're getting it right.
923600	924600	Exactly.
924600	928280	Speaking of things coming out for the 360, Japan is actually getting lucky, you might
928280	933560	remember when the console launched over in Japan, they didn't get a core unit, they basically
933560	935920	just had the premium unit, and that was it.
935920	941320	Well now the 360 core is making its way over to Japan, and they're getting a few additions
941320	942320	to it.
942320	946400	One, the price point is going to be less than what it is in the United States, it's only
946400	954080	going to be 29,800 yen, which is around about $255, which is about 40 bucks less than what
954080	960320	we're paying for it now, and actually what's kind of neat about it is the core pack will
960320	968160	include two games, 99 Nights and Project Gotham Racing 3 as well, so that's pretty cool.
968160	973360	Also the hard drives are supposed to be sold around 85 bucks there too, so, you know, overall
973360	977200	they're getting a pretty good discount, I wish we'd get some bundles over here, but
977200	979880	that's not going to be the case.
979880	982080	And all that's going to be available November 2nd.
982080	984720	Alright, sounds good.
984720	992800	Well, speaking of things that are to be released, you know, the premium Xbox 360, this is in
992800	999320	UK news by the way, is not going to get the price cut for Christmas, but an HD DVD and
999320	1006340	console package is coming out, and it's actually been stated that the standalone HD DVD is
1006340	1012960	going to be out for retail of 199 pounds, so 200 quid, not bad.
1012960	1021520	It'll be, in Euros that's 293 Euros by the way, and it will come with two HD DVD movies.
1021520	1029560	Also there's a rumor that the premium console bundle with the movie player will be coming
1029560	1036320	out around 400 pounds, and the speculations could even be as low as 375.
1036320	1039600	Why are we hearing more about this in Europe than we are in the US?
1039600	1043880	The news has been very quiet on the HD DVD expansion here in the US, is Microsoft waiting
1043880	1044880	for something?
1044880	1045880	X06?
1045880	1046880	When is that?
1046880	1047880	I don't remember.
1047880	1051680	Because as we speculated last week with the whole, you know, Halo 3 is coming out earlier
1051680	1054400	in the year, does it seem like Microsoft's going to be holding a press conference soon
1054400	1055920	where they start announcing a lot of this stuff?
1055920	1056920	I think so.
1056920	1057920	Interesting.
1057920	1064200	Because the other rumor, which we'll get into later, was another racing game.
1064200	1068240	Microsoft isn't really commenting on it as much yet, and I guess it's for the same reason
1068240	1073240	that we're not seeing much on it over here, but it's really looking like they're actually
1073240	1080960	trying to now really take advantage of the UK market, is what it seems like.
1080960	1082560	I just want to point this out in chat.
1082560	1084360	The chat is on this big kick right now.
1084360	1088320	I never understand when the chat room gets on this thing and they beat these inside jokes
1088320	1092200	into the ground, but right now the joke running in chat right now is breaking news.
1092200	1095040	People are writing, breaking news, and then something silly after that.
1095040	1096840	But this one's actually kind of interesting.
1096840	1097840	It was written here.
1097840	1098840	Oh, damn it.
1098840	1099840	I lost my thought.
1099840	1100840	Oh, there it is.
1100840	1101840	This was written by, and I apologize.
1101840	1102840	I'm not sure how to pronounce this name.
1102840	1106360	It's Nazgu1slayer or something like that.
1106360	1109480	It's N-A-Z-G-U-1-S-L-A-Y-R.
1109480	1110480	It's Nazgu1slayer.
1110480	1112760	Oh, that makes sense.
1112760	1113760	This just in.
1113760	1118440	When people buy the Oblivion horse armor, they will buy the PGR deck in UNO.
1118440	1119440	That's true.
1119440	1120440	Somebody's going to buy it.
1120440	1122680	Somebody will buy it, but not me.
1122680	1123680	Sorry.
1123680	1126960	UNO's cool and all, but I don't need 100 points for new cards that are basically a commercial
1126960	1128360	for another Microsoft game.
1128360	1131040	They need an UNO deck that's the horse armor.
1131040	1134680	Just showing off the horse armor to get people to buy the horse armor.
1134680	1135720	You were right, by the way, Jamie.
1135720	1137720	It's Nazgu1slayer.
1137720	1143920	Anyways, some stuff that Japan's also going to be seeing a price drop in is going to be
1143920	1145760	the PlayStation 2.
1145760	1150840	And that's actually pretty interesting because I don't think any, well, everybody else has
1150840	1157000	been dropping the price of the PS2, but the PS2's going to be dropping to 19,980 yen,
1157000	1159120	which is about $170.
1159120	1163520	It's not too big of a drop, but you know, still an okay drop.
1163520	1173440	And if I remember correctly, the, what was it, I'm sorry.
1173440	1174480	That was the old price.
1174480	1175480	I'm an idiot.
1175480	1176480	My mistake.
1176480	1177480	It's okay.
1177480	1178480	People make mistakes.
1178480	1179480	It's fine.
1179480	1180480	Yes.
1180480	1181480	Should do my research.
1181480	1182480	I'm not allowed to make mistakes.
1182480	1184840	Just so you know, the dozens and dozens of people listening to this show are going to
1184840	1186200	be very upset at you.
1186200	1187200	I know.
1187200	1190320	That's okay, you can just give them the raspberry.
1190320	1191320	I'm sorry.
1191320	1198400	The new suggested retail price for the PS2 in the, in Japan is going to be 16,000 yen,
1198400	1201520	which is approximately $138.
1201520	1204760	Not the $170 as I mentioned previously.
1204760	1209760	It is effective September 15th, which opens up, which I guess that might be their way
1209760	1215800	of stealing, you know, the Wii announcement thunder, but whatever.
1215800	1217760	So yeah, that's going to be happening soon.
1217760	1221440	In case, you know, you might be one of those people in Japan that hasn't bought a PlayStation
1221440	1223880	2 yet, which is ridiculous.
1223880	1225360	All right.
1225360	1229680	Well, something that is ridiculous is when we have to miss a week of Dark Sakura giving
1229680	1232920	us her website of the week and we missed it last week.
1232920	1236920	So that means this week's website is going to be twice as good because Dark Sakura likes
1236920	1241040	to go up and down and left and right on the internet, BA select start.
1241040	1245600	And she's, she finds a website that she thinks all of you ought to be checking out right
1245600	1246600	now.
1246600	1249520	Dark Sakura, what is the website of the week?
1249520	1254680	The website of the week is gamer.org, g-a-y-m-e-r.org.
1254680	1260760	Um, I, stop doing that face.
1260760	1264160	I'm talking to Junami the dork as usual.
1264160	1266480	Um, it's actually, it was really cool.
1266480	1270520	I ran across this, um, just looking randomly.
1270520	1275720	Um, it's a site basically for gay and gay friendly gaming, pretty much.
1275720	1281200	Um, in fact, to go ahead and read, um, a little blurb off of the website, it says, you know,
1281200	1283000	why do you need a gay gamer site?
1283000	1286780	The truth is in the gaming community, there are some pretty staunchly homophobic players
1286780	1287780	and gamer.org.
1287780	1288780	Yeah, Junami.
1288780	1289780	Yeah.
1289780	1290780	Who makes faces.
1290780	1294960	It's about having fun without hearing the bashing.
1294960	1299040	And that, you know, I like what this here, so I give this site to you as a safe haven
1299040	1301280	where gaming is a focus, not hate.
1301280	1304280	There's actually a World of Warcraft guild on here that's on the Blackwing server, their
1304280	1309520	alliance, um, called Alternatives with an altered dash native.
1309520	1310520	It's pretty cool.
1310520	1315480	Um, but I've looked at the site, they've got some, it's some core views, gaming news.
1315480	1319920	Um, it's a pretty well put together site.
1319920	1325720	I mean, I'd say not overly a lot to look at, but the information is great.
1325720	1328960	I love the, you know, tweeting over the community there.
1328960	1334080	I only have one complaint about this site and that's when you go over the dropdown menus.
1334080	1339120	I don't like the, the little tinkle noise.
1339120	1343520	It's fairy dust spreading all over your computer as you visit the site.
1343520	1347200	It's this high pitched little noise and I'm like, are you gaying my computer?
1347200	1351860	Well, actually I don't need, I'm in your computer gating you up.
1351860	1354680	I have to give a shout out to a couple other, although that is a good site.
1354680	1355680	I have visited this.
1355680	1359800	I give a shout out to a couple other gay friendly gaming sites because, you know, a couple of
1359800	1361160	years ago there weren't any.
1361160	1364160	So it's really nice to see these, you know, gay gamer sites that are awesome.
1364160	1368120	And one of them I've been visiting a lot recently because they have a hilarious blog.
1368120	1369120	I love it.
1369120	1372280	It's gaygamer.net and they have a hilarious blog there.
1372280	1376320	They've been photoshopping Nintendudes is their latest thing going on and they have
1376320	1379620	like Nintendudes twink edition and things like that.
1379620	1381040	It's silly, but it's funny.
1381040	1382040	To me, it's funny.
1382040	1385560	Uh, and they got some forums there too, and I also have to mention, uh, gamer experimentations
1385560	1387040	is another forum I've posted on before.
1387040	1389440	They have a semi-active community over there.
1389440	1393200	And when that whole, uh, world of Warcraft, you know, guild thing was going down a couple
1393200	1396400	months ago, a very, very active discussion going on over there.
1396400	1397880	So very cool.
1397880	1404680	Um, speaking of gay and world of Warcraft, some of the sound clips have come out for
1404680	1408040	the, they've leaked to the internet somehow from the beta or I don't know what some of
1408040	1413160	the sound clips and some of the new races, including blood elves and drannes.
1413160	1418960	So now I'm not saying that the blood elfs are gay, but here's a clip of what one of
1418960	1422320	the things the blood elf says and you be the judge.
1422320	1425760	Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like me?
1425760	1427880	Oh my God.
1427880	1428880	Nob?
1428880	1430360	No, I don't know.
1430360	1436640	You must now take back that homophobic joke because I am making one of those.
1436640	1439520	All right.
1439520	1443040	You know, I, and there's some great sound clips as well.
1443040	1447000	That's just to the iceberg, but then get this, the female blood elf seems to be a little
1447000	1448000	bit of a valley girl.
1448000	1449000	I don't know.
1449000	1450000	You tell me on this one.
1450000	1451640	I went to under city to get a facial.
1451640	1453800	Have you seen these people?
1453800	1459040	I said, you don't have a lower jaw and you're going to give me a facial.
1459040	1460040	She got mad.
1460040	1461480	At least I think she did.
1461480	1467120	You ever heard someone talk with on a lower jaw?
1467120	1470400	She sounded like a murloc.
1470400	1476800	Or getting her hair done at a troll shop and winding up with a mohawk and a fricking bone
1476800	1477800	in her nose.
1477800	1478800	Getting her hair did.
1478800	1479800	Kill it.
1479800	1480800	Kill it.
1480800	1481800	Kill it.
1481800	1484600	Although the female Draenei voices are also funny.
1484600	1486600	Asking if gnomes come with vibrate functions.
1486600	1489200	This, this, hey, I haven't gotten there yet.
1489200	1490200	I haven't gotten there yet.
1490200	1491200	Come on, play it.
1491200	1492700	You stinking jerk.
1492700	1493700	Here's the Draenei female.
1493700	1496000	Do gnomes have a vibrate setting?
1496000	1497480	I did not call that.
1497480	1498480	Hey, shut up.
1498480	1499480	We couldn't hear that over your bitching.
1499480	1502160	Do gnomes have a vibrate setting?
1502160	1504040	I'm just curious.
1504040	1505600	I did not mean to call that.
1505600	1508420	What is, what is the thing with gnomes and the Draenei?
1508420	1509840	Is there some type of connection there?
1509840	1510840	I don't know.
1510840	1511840	Is it a fetish thing?
1511840	1512960	The Draenei are tall.
1512960	1513960	Gnomes are short.
1513960	1521280	There's a, there's a joke in D&D, in third edition at least, that they're, it's something,
1521280	1524320	I don't think it's, um, it's with gnomes though.
1524320	1525320	They're puntable.
1525320	1526560	That's all things to be said.
1526560	1528560	Gnomes like to move around or something.
1528560	1529560	I don't think dumb like that.
1529560	1530560	I don't know.
1530560	1531560	I heard it a while ago.
1531560	1532560	I don't know what I'm talking about.
1532560	1533560	I'm just trying to talk.
1533560	1534560	All right.
1534560	1536800	Um, now I have to, now you may have noticed that the Draenei appear to have a little bit
1536800	1538880	of a Russian accent going on.
1538880	1542760	Now tell me if that isn't downright blatant in this clip of the male that we have.
1542760	1544600	I love this planet.
1544600	1548900	I come here, I see cow and chicken and ride little horses.
1548900	1550900	This planet has everything.
1550900	1555200	Oh my God, it's a, it's Balki.
1555200	1556200	Oh no.
1556200	1558200	What was that show?
1558200	1563400	They was on perfect strangers.
1563400	1566040	In old country, boobs did not fly free.
1566040	1568600	They were disciplined, structured.
1568600	1570760	That's why we have Uthas brassieres.
1570760	1572600	They hold boobies in place.
1572600	1576040	In Soviet Russia.
1576040	1579800	In the world of Warcraft, Draenei drink you.
1579800	1581800	I don't know.
1581800	1582800	Silly.
1582800	1590040	To add to the cultural influence confusion, male Draenei, their dance animation is the
1590040	1592320	internet phenomenon tunak tunak tun dance.
1592320	1593320	That's awesome.
1593320	1597960	And blood elf males do have the Napoleon Dynamite dance going for them.
1597960	1598960	Ew.
1598960	1600040	That's great.
1600040	1601720	Just to add to their sexual ambiguity.
1601720	1604040	Even the Napoleon Dynamite is kind of last year's news.
1604040	1605560	That's kind of, that's kind of awesome.
1605560	1606760	I hate Napoleon Dynamite.
1606760	1607760	You hate Napoleon Dynamite?
1607760	1611040	I'm like the one person in the world that thought that movie was the best thing in the
1611040	1612040	world.
1612040	1615200	The problem is that the movie got so hyped up, by the time a lot of people saw it, they
1615200	1616200	were like, that's it?
1616200	1620240	No, the only, there's only one thing in the world that needs to live up to the hype and
1620240	1622280	that's Snakes on a Plane.
1622280	1623280	And it did.
1623280	1625280	Snakes on a Plane was fantastic.
1625280	1626280	Haven't seen it.
1626280	1627280	Haven't seen it.
1627280	1628280	On another fucking plane.
1628280	1629840	Lord help us all.
1629840	1632560	Yeah, give me my microphone.
1632560	1633560	Thank you.
1633560	1635560	God, I fucking hated that movie.
1635560	1637720	That movie was great.
1637720	1638720	It was dumb.
1638720	1639720	Anyways.
1639720	1648360	Speaking of really stupid things, in World of Warcraft, Planes on Snakes.
1648360	1651160	Give me my jump rope back.
1651160	1652160	Anyways.
1652160	1660960	Speaking of really dumb, dumb, dumb speculation, there was a, I guess, a story posted about
1660960	1665240	how some cryptologists have figured out the weed aid.
1665240	1666920	And here's how they did it.
1666920	1667920	Roman numerals.
1667920	1669920	Oh god, I heard about that.
1669920	1670920	Roman numerals.
1670920	1676760	Because, you see, a W is actually, looks like two Vs, which would equal ten.
1676760	1685320	And the two Is would be two, therefore, October 2nd, therefore, they are stupid, is my opinion
1685320	1688320	on the whole thing.
1688320	1695440	Look, with all due respect to the sites that ran this story, why is this news?
1695440	1698440	Why is this news?
1698440	1701000	This is not news.
1701000	1707400	Me coming over there to strangle you for running stories like this that perpetuate these stinking
1707400	1710760	rumors, that would be news.
1710760	1714120	That is great video game journalism when I come strangle you for running these stories
1714120	1716400	around the internet.
1716400	1717400	Thank you.
1717400	1719360	That just broke my ear.
1719360	1720360	You're welcome.
1720360	1721360	I got you back for earlier.
1721360	1723040	Oh no, I guess that was Jamie who did it earlier.
1723040	1724040	That was me.
1724040	1725040	Traitor.
1725040	1726040	Traitor.
1726040	1730880	I have to say this, because in the chat room here, I'm not sure if this is Cage or Kage,
1730880	1731880	it's probably Kage.
1731880	1732880	Kage.
1732880	1736720	Snakes, oh, whoops, that's not what I was, that's not the comment I wanted to read.
1736720	1742640	Kage said this, World of Warcraft is YTMND with a level cap.
1742640	1745600	That's kind of a good way to sum it up.
1745600	1746920	I like that comment.
1746920	1747920	True.
1747920	1750200	Who is the snake with?
1750200	1753280	Nothing, it's about what made the movie I rated.
1753280	1754280	Rob.
1754280	1755280	Yes.
1755280	1756280	Rob.
1756280	1757280	Yes.
1757280	1758280	Rob.
1758280	1759280	Rob.
1759280	1760280	Traitor.
1760280	1762320	So is it my turn now?
1762320	1765920	You want to report this on your blogs, I'll give you a worldwide exclusive.
1765920	1770120	Sky leaves Orange Lounge Radio right before episode 200, amazing.
1770120	1771800	And no one cares.
1771800	1773160	Yeah, no one cares, no one running.
1773160	1775240	And we replace him with a flask of coffee.
1775240	1781800	You have to understand, no one's going to believe that you left the show until IGN reports
1781800	1784520	it anyways.
1784520	1788160	Yes next week I'm going to be- And first it has to circulate on 1UP.
1788160	1792320	That's the big news for next week's show, is that I'm replaced with a blood elf male
1792320	1793320	actually.
1793320	1796440	Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like me?
1796440	1797440	Anyway.
1797440	1802400	No, your girlfriend won't put your feet in.
1802400	1803400	Okay.
1803400	1804680	Back to the news.
1804680	1806600	My God, you people are random.
1806600	1809040	I blame Junami's presence.
1809040	1818320	Anyway, as he bowels, bowels, oh my God, oh my God, I just cleaned the carpet, Drew.
1818320	1821280	RG paper trained, please.
1821280	1822280	Okay.
1822280	1830480	Our dear friends at Squeenix are being sued by Softworld International for 3.78 million
1830480	1832480	dollars.
1832480	1841440	Now, apparently Squeenix owed them a source code for an MMO and did not provide it in
1841440	1842440	enough time.
1842440	1848320	So they said, uh-uh-uh, you affected our sales, bitches, pay.
1848320	1851400	And that's the story.
1851400	1853000	I could be on CNN.
1853000	1859440	Somebody had a five-hour time!
1859440	1861880	DMN has a new nickname for Drew.
1861880	1862880	Poodami.
1862880	1864880	How old are we?
1864880	1866880	He said poo.
1866880	1873280	Does this mean I have to team up with Pooh Eater?
1873280	1874280	Hey, Drew, are these-
1874280	1876760	Then we won't have to worry about a mess.
1876760	1877760	Pooh Maker and Pooh Eater.
1877760	1880120	Are these poo jokes making you angry?
1880120	1881120	Very angry.
1881120	1882120	Then you know what time it is.
1882120	1898760	FUs of the week time.
1898760	1904680	My FU of the week goes towards the really- no, no, no, no, no, it wasn't that.
1904680	1908380	I actually do not quite recall what it was I was so angry about because I was really
1908380	1910420	freaking angry.
1910420	1912360	Was it when you called me from downtown earlier?
1912360	1913360	No.
1913360	1915820	Well, okay, this is my- and I hate to resort to traffic.
1915820	1917500	This is what it was.
1917500	1921640	Fucking person who almost ran into me while I was on the 80.
1921640	1923640	On your car?
1923640	1931420	No, it was some dumbass was swerving to avoid another dumbass and nearly ran into me and
1931420	1932420	I swerved.
1932420	1936320	I managed to stay in my lane, but like five people behind me had to pull into the gut-
1936320	1941780	the side because they were all swerving and I'm like shhh.
1941780	1947520	And then all the traffic on the day bridge since they did all the work on it.
1947520	1948520	Aren't they done with the work though?
1948520	1951280	They're supposed to be, but it was still stupid.
1951280	1960640	Great nude genius idiot backup.
1960640	1962600	I personally dislike you now.
1962600	1963600	Alright.
1963600	1965680	But I'm also lying.
1965680	1966680	Low-key.
1966680	1967680	Anyway.
1967680	1968680	Um.
1968680	1980800	F you to- to all those sites out there who just forget that we report news a week early
1980800	1986240	and take it from the big guys, including people that post in their blogs on these so-called
1986240	1989800	sites about stuff that's gonna happen.
1989800	1990800	You know?
1990800	1991800	Whatever.
1991800	1993920	I give up.
1993920	1997280	And also fuck you to Blaze Angels because that game sucks and I'm done with you bitch!
1997280	1998280	I'm done with you!
1998280	2001000	I'm gonna kick you to the fucking curb!
2001000	2002000	Or GameStop.
2002000	2005600	Or the curb in front of GameStop.
2005600	2009640	My F you of the week goes to the amazing off-topicness of tonight's show.
2009640	2010640	It's amazing.
2010640	2013620	You know, because we're gonna have a lot of new listeners tonight thanks to the DDR stuff
2013620	2016200	so you know, wow, we're doing well.
2016200	2022400	And then I would also say F you to just how crazy my work has been.
2022400	2028080	Next week is gonna suck and it makes me wanna cry but you know, it's a job.
2028080	2029080	Pays the rent.
2029080	2030080	What can I say?
2030080	2034480	Chris, do you have any F yous?
2034480	2039760	My F you goes to whoever invented the United States.
2039760	2045520	He sucks and needs to get resurrected and die again because as most of you know, my
2045520	2047400	girlfriend lives in Wisconsin.
2047400	2049680	I live in Northern California.
2049680	2052600	I can't walk there and it makes me sad.
2052600	2053600	I miss her a lot.
2053600	2055600	It makes me sad when she's not here.
2055600	2058480	What happened to the pedestrians?
2058480	2059480	Fuck pedestrians!
2059480	2060480	Fuck America!
2060480	2062480	I want her right here!
2062480	2070280	I thought it was gonna be a political rant and then it was just a F you to the distance.
2070280	2071280	My heart aches.
2071280	2072280	Gush, gush, gush.
2072280	2073280	Cute.
2073280	2077280	Should it hurt me trying to get rid of her on the phone?
2077280	2080560	Like not get rid of her but when I was talking to her on the phone during the break, I was
2080560	2081560	going, I miss you!
2081560	2082560	I love you!
2082560	2083560	She's like, I miss you!
2083560	2084560	Okay, I gotta go.
2084560	2085560	I miss you!
2085560	2086560	I love you!
2086560	2087560	And I'm not that sad.
2087560	2088560	I just threw up in my mouth.
2088560	2089560	Shut up!
2089560	2090560	I'm a girl.
2090560	2091560	Alright, Drew, any F yous?
2091560	2100280	Alright, F you to friends of mine who call in on their 21st and ask me to roll a DC 15
2100280	2102800	check against their fortitude to see if they're drunk.
2102800	2105520	I shit you not.
2105520	2108800	He had me roll to see if he was drunk on four running trunks.
2108800	2111800	Roll the dice to see if I'm getting drunk!
2111800	2112800	Yeah, you are!
2112800	2114800	Is there any girls there?
2114800	2115800	Yeah!
2115800	2120320	If there's any girls there, I want to do them!
2120320	2121320	There you have it.
2121320	2122960	God, kill me now.
2122960	2126200	And there were, and I did, but I wasn't there.
2126200	2128200	I was playing Ogres.
2128200	2133120	You're not there, you're getting drunk!
2133120	2137560	Also, a big F you to guild drama on my server.
2137560	2139280	It really sucks ass.
2139280	2141800	Silverwing wanted to know if he failed, by the way.
2141800	2145560	He did fail his, he did fail his check.
2145560	2150800	His DC 15, he rolled an 8.
2150800	2156880	Wow, you know, shows like this drive me to drink.
2156880	2159240	Games like this might drive me to drink too, I'm not sure.
2159240	2160240	No, it might be okay.
2160240	2166120	It's a game coming out from Ubisoft and it's called Alive, supposedly going to be coming
2166120	2167120	out in 2007.
2167120	2170120	It was first talked about in March 2006.
2170120	2175100	What makes this interesting is that this game has been referred to as an Action Plus title.
2175100	2180060	It's a genre that, let's see, who is this person, the International Herald Tribune writer
2180060	2187760	Doreen Carvajal has spun into Ubisoft's attempt to focus on what the writer says is the feminine
2187760	2189960	side of gaming.
2189960	2194960	In other words, the reason is because Alive is more oriented toward drama, more life and
2194960	2196220	characters, more depth.
2196220	2200720	It's about surviving, but you can't resolve things by shooting only.
2200720	2204960	You see, Alive features characters who rely on their instincts and each other to endure
2204960	2206840	after an earthquake.
2206840	2209480	So in other words, boring!
2209480	2212880	So apparently, girls like boring games, who knew?
2212880	2214880	Fuck that noise!
2214880	2215880	Okay.
2215880	2218160	That was not nice.
2218160	2220440	I like killing things as much as an S person.
2220440	2225040	In all seriousness, if Ubisoft wants to make the ultimate girl game, what should they be
2225040	2228920	making?
2228920	2231360	A Lorena Bob at the MMO.
2231360	2236160	Next topic!
2236160	2245760	They need to make fucking Barbie Horse Adventures 6, you know, Barbie with a Vengeance or something.
2245760	2246760	Barbie fucks you up.
2246760	2252400	No, it was a really good girl game, I thought.
2252400	2253400	It was for the computer.
2253400	2254400	Alice.
2254400	2255400	American McGee's Alice.
2255400	2257680	That was a fucking great game.
2257680	2258680	I love that.
2258680	2259680	Drugs.
2259680	2263200	Yeah, maybe if you're a girl smoking crack.
2263200	2268120	IGN ripping off O.L.R. said magazine Chris is pro-lesbian too.
2268120	2269120	What?
2269120	2270120	What is that from?
2270120	2271120	For a game suggestion.
2271120	2272120	Oh, okay.
2272120	2273120	Oh, that's hot.
2273120	2274120	Eh.
2274120	2275120	A bunch of us making out.
2275120	2276120	Anywho.
2276120	2280800	Speaking of games for girls, Dead Rising is supposed to be getting some download content
2280800	2282200	here pretty soon.
2282200	2286360	Actually, they did get some download content, but there's going to be some coming to in-store
2286360	2288120	kiosks as well.
2288120	2294280	If you actually check online, they do have on the marketplace a brand new costume, I
2294280	2295280	guess.
2295280	2297280	Cold-hearted snake is what it's called.
2297280	2299240	No idea what that looks like because I haven't actually played it.
2299240	2300240	It looks like Paula Abdul.
2300240	2302160	No, it's a snake outfit.
2302160	2305520	Or, not like solid snake, but it looks like snake skin is your suit.
2305520	2307520	It's like a snake skin suit.
2307520	2308520	Exactly.
2308520	2309920	So that's kind of cool.
2309920	2316160	And then in the in-store kiosks, they're supposed to be getting Accountant, Burgundy Wine, Pure
2316160	2318440	White Suit, and Stripe.
2318440	2323380	And those are going to be available in Keys and the brand new September Kiosk disc.
2323380	2325920	So look for that pretty soon.
2325920	2332000	Alright, something to look for in the far off future would be Project Gotham Racing
2332000	2333000	4.
2333000	2337000	The French site just confirmed that there is supposed to be a fourth installment of
2337000	2338680	Project Gotham Racing.
2338680	2342760	Now, honestly though, is this a surprise to anyone?
2342760	2343760	Nope.
2343760	2347760	Probably not, so I'm not even sure why we're reporting on this, but there you go.
2347760	2352000	It's making their news around different web blogs this week that Project Gotham 4 looks
2352000	2356840	like it's been confirmed because it's through this contest, or it's through the site that's
2356840	2361040	talking about having a contest for designing the car and the winning design will be on
2361040	2363280	Project Gotham Racing 4.
2363280	2367480	Just like Test Drive Unlimited.
2367480	2375320	And actually neat news, sorry, you know, Project Gotham 4 has, it's going to be in my house
2375320	2380920	and it's going to annoy the crap out of me, just like its predecessors did.
2380920	2386960	But there is some news, who of our listeners reads Vibe Magazine?
2386960	2401680	Yeah, not usually the best known thing for gaming news, however, that they had $150 under
2401680	2405920	a description for the Wii in their last issue.
2405920	2416760	In fact, I'm looking at the image now, it has down at the bottom just a little description
2416760	2423600	about all the stuff that's going to be on it, it says $150, www.nintendo.com.
2423600	2433480	So we're not sure if that's actually going to be, just based off of rumors or if it's
2433480	2438120	going to be more in the, you know, close to $300 range like we were hearing before.
2438120	2441440	I think it's a rumor.
2441440	2444600	I think that they've posted, you know, unsubstantiated information.
2444600	2448880	I think it was just a placeholder that accidentally went to print that shouldn't have, I don't
2448880	2449880	think it means anything.
2449880	2454120	But of course, you know, wasn't there those rumors saying that the Europe site said it
2454120	2458520	was going to be 150 pounds, so, you know, 150 pounds would be a lot from here.
2458520	2462640	Well, yes, but, you know, usually like if it's $299 here, like look at the PlayStation
2462640	2467160	3, it's going to be $599 here, or $599 over there, so, you know, possible.
2467160	2472400	I'm actually, I think converting that would bring it up to at least a 200.
2472400	2478000	I know it's not possible, but can you imagine if they, like, release that for $99.99?
2478000	2479000	That would be phenomenal.
2479000	2481600	It would fly off the shelves.
2481600	2482600	Everyone would own a Wii.
2482600	2486720	That would be awesome, but even $199 is going to be pretty good.
2486720	2492000	But hey, well you're going to know in a couple of days anyway, so who cares?
2492000	2495160	Alright well this is the part of the show where we open it up to you guys to call us

2522200	2523600	Once again, I am number one.
2523600	2524600	Damn, I'm good.
2524600	2526720	Yeah, you just had to stick your finger there.
2526720	2527720	Hi, Ron Jon.
2527720	2528720	DJ Rama.
2528720	2530720	Hey, I hear you're a snitch.
2530720	2533840	Well, what can I say?
2533840	2535760	Someone pays my bills.
2535760	2542600	My finger is floating over the hang-up button, so you better have something good to say.
2542600	2546400	Well, I have a lot of good stuff to say, because you know, if you're going to do that, I wasn't
2546400	2549400	going to preach you to Dunkin' Donuts when you came to New York City.
2549400	2551240	Okay, then maybe I won't hang up on you.
2551240	2552240	What's on your mind, buddy?
2552240	2553240	Oh, a few things.
2553240	2558320	I want to say hi to everybody in the studio, and a special hello to the Angel of Death
2558320	2559320	Loki.
2559320	2560320	Hi.
2560320	2566160	Oh, I forgot to mention, yes, this is kind of funny.
2566160	2569920	They had screenshots from Africa get posted this week.
2569920	2570920	Africa.
2570920	2573800	Can we figure out what the game's about yet?
2573800	2574800	Nope.
2574800	2575800	It's just pictures of animals.
2575800	2577800	It's about animal poo.
2577800	2578800	Hooray.
2578800	2579800	Africa.
2579800	2580800	Africa.
2580800	2581800	All right.
2581800	2582800	What's on your mind, really, Rama?
2582800	2586640	Well, I play DDR Supernova, and I'm in love.
2586640	2587640	Really?
2587640	2589360	What did you love about DDR Supernova?
2589360	2591200	I just love the eye candy to it.
2591200	2598280	I mean, the new videos, all the new characters dancing, especially Emmy's new costume.
2598280	2599280	Emmy's new costume.
2599280	2603760	What would you say is your favorite song in DDR Supernova?
2603760	2608840	I only got just to play one song, and right now, I was floored by Centerfold.
2608840	2610920	Oh, the Captain Jack song?
2610920	2611920	Yes.
2611920	2615080	All right, that's cool.
2615080	2618480	So are you going to be picking up the home version when it comes out for PS2?
2618480	2619480	Fuck yes.
2619480	2620480	All right.
2620480	2621480	Sounds good.
2621480	2623040	You know, I hear you can make your own steps at home and then take them to the arcade.
2623040	2624040	It should be fun.
2624040	2625040	Like the old days?
2625040	2626040	That would be awesome, but...
2626040	2627040	Like the old days?
2627040	2628040	Hmm?
2628040	2629040	It's like the old days.
2629040	2632320	Yeah, but the machines around here don't have memory cards.
2632320	2633320	Don't.
2633320	2634320	They need to get them.
2634320	2636560	I'm working on it.
2636560	2638120	All right.
2638120	2639300	Anything else on your mind, Rama?
2639300	2645280	I beat New Super Mario Brothers, and Nintendo threw old schoolers a bone in the game.
2645280	2647280	Oh, what's that?
2647280	2650400	Wait until you get to the final level in the castle.
2650400	2651640	That's all I'm going to say.
2651640	2653000	All right.
2653000	2654000	Sounds good.
2654000	2655000	All right, Rama.
2655000	2656000	We've got to let you go.
2656000	2657000	We've got to get more callers, okay?
2657000	2658000	Two more things on my thing.
2658000	2662480	Number one, I picked up Beat Mania for 40 bucks at Version Megastore, and I'm calling
2662480	2666240	out Drunami and Nintendo Maniac 64 for bad phone calls.
2666240	2667240	Come on.
2667240	2669200	I'm raising the bar here.
2669200	2670200	Come on.
2670200	2671200	You can do better than me.
2671200	2672200	Oh, dear.
2672200	2673200	Drunami, response?
2673200	2674840	Damn fighting words.
2674840	2675840	It's on.
2675840	2676840	Bring it!
2676840	2677840	Come on.
2677840	2678840	Bye, Rama.
2678840	2679840	Have a good one.
2679840	2680840	Bye.
2680840	2681840	All right.
2681840	2682840	We're going to go to another call here on the-
2682840	2683840	I'm going to answer.
2683840	2684840	Skype line.
2684840	2685840	Huh?
2685840	2686840	Huh?
2686840	2687840	I'm going to answer it.
2687840	2688840	Rob.
2688840	2689840	Okay.
2689840	2690840	Africa.
2690840	2691840	Africa.
2691840	2692840	Zebra Buzz.
2692840	2693840	All right.
2693840	2694840	Let's go to another call here on Orange Lounge Radio.
2694840	2695840	Hey, you're calling Orange Lounge Radio.
2695840	2696840	Who's this?
2696840	2697840	Hi.
2697840	2698840	This is Solar Wing.
2698840	2699840	Hi, Solar Wing.
2699840	2700840	You've never called the show before, have you?
2700840	2701840	No.
2701840	2703400	I'm a first time actually live listener.
2703400	2704400	All right.
2704400	2706200	We're popping someone's Skype cherry tonight.
2706200	2707200	That's awesome.
2707200	2709360	We're happy to have some new blood on the show tonight.
2709360	2710920	What's on your mind, buddy?
2710920	2714000	Actually, a few things first.
2714000	2718560	The PS3 thing, how many do you actually think will actually make it to Canada?
2718560	2725400	Because it says 400,000 to North America that necessarily mean anything about it just going
2725400	2728760	to States or Canada or what?
2728760	2732200	That's a damn good point that I don't know if anyone's really thought of about how many
2732200	2733660	of those machines are going to Canada.
2733660	2737640	Everyone assumed North America is just United States, kind of like Europe doesn't exist
2737640	2739120	and Mexico apparently.
2739120	2744440	So you know- I think Mexico is getting 350,000.
2744440	2748200	You want to know what's sad, my friend, is that probably Canada is getting about 10,000
2748200	2749460	of that.
2749460	2751720	Don't say that.
2751720	2752720	Are you a Sony fan?
2752720	2755780	No, I actually owe someone a PS3.
2755780	2758120	You owe someone a PS3?
2758120	2759120	Oh my God.
2759120	2760940	You must have done something big.
2760940	2761940	This is what I want to know.
2761940	2762940	What did you do?
2762940	2763940	What did you do?
2763940	2768480	It is a Christmas present, wedding present, birthday present from two years.
2768480	2769480	Wow.
2769480	2770480	Oh wow.
2770480	2774880	So this is like a get out of presents- are you having to make up for presents you forgot?
2774880	2777200	No, he had a choice.
2777200	2780280	It was either Xbox 360 or PS3.
2780280	2784400	He chose the PS3 because he hates me.
2784400	2785400	I see.
2785400	2790280	So this is going to be a get out of presents free pass for the next two years, apparently.
2790280	2791280	I hope so.
2791280	2792280	Wow.
2792280	2793280	That's a pretty big one.
2793280	2799520	Well, you know, even so, I think that with the shipment coming out- so the B sellers
2799520	2802480	like the other systems are, there shouldn't be any type of region coding or any type of
2802480	2803480	specification between.
2803480	2804960	No, no, not for Canada.
2804960	2810000	So I wouldn't see why you can't order one off of like GameStop site or something like
2810000	2811000	that.
2811000	2813320	Yeah, you might be able to just order- it might cost a little extra for shipping, but
2813320	2814680	if we're- Order from Sony style.
2814680	2818880	Yeah, push came to shove, you could order one from a US website and just have it shipped
2818880	2819880	to Canada.
2819880	2821080	Yeah, I could probably do that.
2821080	2825880	It's just, yeah, $700 as it is, plus how much are the games?
2825880	2832120	Yeah, true, we're talking $600 American, which is a little bit more in Canadian, although
2832120	2833320	not much lately.
2833320	2836160	The dollars are equating pretty soon here.
2836160	2838760	What part of Canada are you from?
2838760	2840880	West Coast, near Toronto.
2840880	2841880	Near Toronto?
2841880	2842880	Yeah.
2842880	2844800	Wait, Toronto's not- wait, they consider Toronto the West Coast?
2844800	2845800	Oh, East.
2845800	2846800	Sorry.
2846800	2847800	I was like, wait a minute, wait a minute.
2847800	2848800	East.
2848800	2849800	East.
2849800	2850800	Yeah.
2850800	2853400	I mean, it's a little bit on the US border, but you can always dip into the US and try
2853400	2856880	some of the big best buys around the border, could be a thought.
2856880	2866320	Or even so, a lot of the distributors, the national distributors, are in California.
2866320	2870840	If you order from any of the distribution sites or any of the other, maybe even at the
2870840	2878080	importers, you're still probably going to get a system fairly quickly, as far as shipping's
2878080	2879300	concerned.
2879300	2881520	My other question was about the new NDSs.
2881520	2882520	Yeah.
2882520	2883520	What about them?
2883520	2884520	Black.
2884520	2885520	What do you think about them?
2885520	2887920	I'm getting a pink one, end of story.
2887920	2889400	I like mine.
2889400	2891320	It's kind of dirty because it's been in my purse.
2891320	2892560	Wait, you have the white one?
2892560	2893560	The white one.
2893560	2896320	Yeah, you have the virginal white one.
2896320	2898640	Do you think that they'll actually fix that crack issue?
2898640	2900920	Oh, the whole, the cracking of the hinges?
2900920	2905640	I imagine because it was such a big deal on the blogs that they'll do something about
2905640	2909680	it, but I don't know what can you really do about the hinges without redesigning the whole
2909680	2910680	setup of the system?
2910680	2911920	I know mine hasn't yet.
2911920	2917000	Yeah, I don't think they all have, but I hear the fats are cracking now, too.
2917000	2920800	One of the blogs I was reading ran a story that their fat was cracking, but it takes
2920800	2925760	one person with an internet site to have that happen, and then it's all over the internet,
2925760	2928480	so I don't know exactly how rampant the cracks are.
2928480	2929480	I haven't seen it.
2929480	2933760	I think that issue is less widespread than people are thinking.
2933760	2934760	Get the black one.
2934760	2935760	You'll be able to see the crack.
2935760	2936760	Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
2936760	2937760	Yeah, there you go.
2937760	2938760	There you go.
2938760	2944920	My last thing, I've played DDR once, and I was looking at getting a PS2.
2944920	2947240	What should I get for DDR?
2947240	2948640	Get an ignition pad, first of all.
2948640	2952360	Yeah, make sure you get a good dance pad, although, well, if he's warming up to DDR,
2952360	2956780	I'd say a $20 dance pad can hold him over to see if he likes the game, especially because
2956780	2959880	you can play the basic songs on the cheapo pads.
2959880	2964320	Once you get into the harder stuff, though, it will start moving under your feet.
2964320	2968760	I would say, by far, the best home release for PS2 is Extreme 2, the most recent one,
2968760	2971620	and that'll be the easiest one to find, but you could probably get some of the oldies
2971620	2978920	for $20 American easily, like Max 2 and DDR Extreme, and they're not bad, but DDR Extreme
2978920	2980600	2 is by far the best one.
2980600	2984520	Probably right after Supernova comes out, that will drop in price, and who knows, maybe
2984520	2986480	actually Supernova is going to be the best one.
2986480	2989240	I couldn't tell you until after I've played it, but it sounds like it's going to be pretty
2989240	2994280	good, but Extreme 2 has a lot of radio-friendly songs and things you might have heard of,
2994280	2998600	before, and not a bunch of crazy stuff that sometimes turns people off to DDR.
2998600	3001000	Alright, well thanks.
3001000	3002000	Not a problem!
3002000	3003000	Thank you so much for calling in.
3003000	3004000	Bye.
3004000	3006660	Alright, have a good one, buddy.
3006660	3009800	Good luck with the PlayStation 3 hunting, that's got to be a pain in the ass.
3009800	3012640	Oh my god, oh, your friend a PlayStation 3?
3012640	3016400	Like Jamie, if I bought you a PlayStation 3, you don't get anything else the rest of
3016400	3018400	your life.
3018400	3019400	That's okay.
3019400	3020400	You don't really want one.
3020400	3022320	Yeah, you don't want a PlayStation 3.
3022320	3024680	If I gave you a PlayStation 3, you'd give it back.
3024680	3029880	No, if you gave me a PlayStation 3, honestly, I'd sell it on eBay for three times what it's
3029880	3031240	worth, and then I'd take us all to Disneyland.
3031240	3032920	Alright, you want to answer the next call, Jamie?
3032920	3034160	No, I decided not to.
3034160	3035160	Okay, I will.
3035160	3036160	No, it's funny.
3036160	3037160	What?
3037160	3038160	Yeah.
3038160	3039160	Africa?
3039160	3040160	They rendered zebra genitalia.
3040160	3041160	Oh, yuck.
3041160	3042160	Oh, zebra cock.
3042160	3043160	I'm going to throw up my mouth.
3043160	3045160	Alright, Jamie, answer the next call.
3045160	3049360	Hi, you've called Orange Jones Radio, feel special.
3049360	3051840	Who are you?
3051840	3057200	Apparently they hung up, they didn't feel so special.
3057200	3059480	They got you and decided to run the other way.
3059480	3062800	Alright, you want to try this one instead?
3062800	3063800	Fine.
3063800	3066360	Hi, you've called Orange Jones Radio.
3066360	3071440	This guy got a feminine voice.
3071440	3074160	No, I talk too much, so.
3074160	3075480	Oh, that's right.
3075480	3078000	Yeah, so we're letting Jamie answer the calls.
3078000	3080800	Oh, I'm sorry.
3080800	3083440	I don't think you've talked enough.
3083440	3084440	Alright.
3084440	3085440	Anyways.
3085440	3089840	What's on your mind, my friend?
3089840	3093240	Well, something you guys have completely overlooked.
3093240	3097240	Next Saturday morning is the season premiere of Dance Revolution.
3097240	3098240	No!
3098240	3103320	I don't think we overlooked it, we just don't care, my friend.
3103320	3105600	I will watch it.
3105600	3107080	I will subject myself.
3107080	3109560	This is the ultimate in video game journalism right there.
3109560	3111640	Self-sacrifice for the better of the community.
3111640	3116840	You know, I'm sure that the entirety of our radio listeners can hear you pointing at Loki.
3116840	3123520	Listen, I sacrificed myself to watch Viva Pinata, and that show sucked, so.
3123520	3127320	I watched the Viva Pinata clips on Xbox Live, I thought it was cute.
3127320	3129320	You're stupid.
3129320	3130320	Jerk.
3130320	3137880	Alright, what else is on your mind, DMN?
3137880	3139360	I can't remember what else.
3139360	3144960	I know I was gonna bug you guys at Dance Revolution, and the other thing slipped my mind, so.
3144960	3147960	I think we'll cut this one short and let you hang up on me.
3147960	3149960	Alright, sounds good.
3149960	3150960	Click.
3150960	3157300	Alright, I think we have time for about one more call here, if you want to give us a call,
3157300	3165720	you can call our username is OrangeLoungeRadio, or you can call our skype line, it's 916-226-9067.
3165720	3166720	Megsy call.
3166720	3169760	Megsy's supposed to call us.
3169760	3170760	Wasn't she the one that hung up?
3170760	3171760	No.
3171760	3172760	Megsy.
3172760	3173760	Let's try, hold on.
3173760	3174760	Jimmy, you gonna answer this?
3174760	3175760	Yeah.
3175760	3176760	You better be Megsy.
3176760	3177760	Yeah, this is Megsy.
3177760	3178760	Hi sweetie!
3178760	3179760	Wow, hi.
3179760	3185760	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, this must be Megsy.
3185760	3187760	This is Megsy.
3187760	3188760	Hey.
3188760	3191760	What's on your mind, Megsy?
3191760	3197800	Uh, okay, first, anyone in the chat room who was listening, do not go to my DeviantArt
3197800	3200240	site, do not look at my bad art.
3200240	3203760	It is not bad, Megsy, you're kind of breaking up, be careful.
3203760	3205760	Okay, uh, better?
3205760	3207760	Yes, better, much better.
3207760	3210760	Okay, don't go to my DeviantArt site.
3210760	3213760	Go to it, look at all of her art, it's beautiful.
3213760	3218760	That was during the bonus segment, podcasters didn't hear it anyway, so, or the podcasters
3218760	3219760	didn't hear it.
3219760	3220760	Yeah, don't worry about it, the majority of them won't go there.
3220760	3221760	Alright.
3221760	3228520	Okay, the other thing is, um, about the Nintendo conference.
3228520	3231000	The Nintendo conference.
3231000	3232000	What about it?
3232000	3238560	Um, gosh, I have been waiting, I am counting the hours until the press conference.
3238560	3240680	Are you a Reggie fangirl?
3240680	3243620	I am so totally a Reggie fangirl.
3243620	3248680	I really hope he gets up there and holds up his 40 and goes, this one's for my homies
3248680	3253440	at OLR, weeee!
3253440	3256000	What are you looking forward to seeing at the WE press conference?
3256000	3261800	Is it just the date and the price to get the anticipation building so you can start taking
3261800	3265960	pre-orders or are you hoping to see some new games or what?
3265960	3270600	I just want to know when I can get it and how much it is and I want to be able to run
3270600	3276400	my games, go up and throw my $50 down and so on.
3276400	3279160	Nintendo, do you think they are going to start taking pre-orders right after the conference
3279160	3281040	or what do you think will happen?
3281040	3283040	I really, really hope so.
3283040	3285040	Alright, sounds good.
3285040	3287640	You're breaking up a little bit, Meg Z, so unfortunately I think we're going to have
3287640	3291480	to wrap it up, but is there anything else you want to say to our listeners or in-studio
3291480	3292480	guests?
3292480	3300160	Uh, Ken Kuduragi, he's the doctor on the crayons, he's still in the world of crayons.
3300160	3302360	Alright, Chris, do you have anything you want to say to Meg Z?
3302360	3304360	I love you, sweetheart.
3304360	3305360	Awww.
3305360	3306680	Alright.
3306680	3307680	Take care, sweetie.
3307680	3308680	Have a good one.
3308680	3309680	Alright.
3309680	3310680	Alright.
3310680	3311680	Yeah, I'm really happy now.
3311680	3312680	Awww.
3312680	3313680	That was cute.
3313680	3314680	Alright.
3314680	3315680	I'm sorry.
3315680	3316680	Awww.
3316680	3319200	Any last- I don't get to see her often, okay?
3319200	3320200	I know.
3320200	3321200	I'm allowed to be sentimental.
3321200	3322200	That's cute.
3322200	3324840	Thank you for letting me be sentimental on radio.
3324840	3326600	That radio show is so gay.
3326600	3328520	I can see the iTunes review now.
3328520	3330040	Gay video game radio.
3330040	3331040	Fuck iTunes.
3331040	3332040	Alright.
3332040	3333040	No, I love iTunes.
3333040	3334720	This is where we get a lot of downloads from.
3334720	3335720	Alright.
3335720	3336720	Um.
3336720	3337720	Any last-minute stories?
3337720	3338720	Um.
3338720	3339720	Actually, yes.
3339720	3340720	Okay.
3340720	3341720	What's on your mind?
3341720	3342720	I like burritos.
3342720	3343720	Okay.
3343720	3347600	Low-key, please help.
3347600	3348600	Not low-key, but I got something.
3348600	3349600	Alright.
3349600	3350600	What do you have?
3350600	3351600	Just a small little tidbit.
3351600	3357040	Uh, GameTap is actually putting, uh, Sam & Max Hit the Road on its, uh, list of games.
3357040	3358040	Oh, yeah.
3358040	3359040	I heard about that.
3359040	3360040	That sounds pretty cool.
3360040	3361040	Oh, yes.
3361040	3362040	Got the new one, yeah.
3362040	3367520	It should be launching, and it's exclusive to them for a few weeks, I think.
3367520	3371480	By the way, DidYouLoseASockInChat says, this podcast puts the gay in gaming.
3371480	3372480	Damn, right.
3372480	3375400	I actually have a question for the chat.
3375400	3376980	But gay can mean happy, right?
3376980	3380480	So just, you know, there's something for everybody.
3380480	3381480	We're happy.
3381480	3382480	What'd you have, Chris?
3382480	3383480	I just had a question.
3383480	3384480	Who's played Xenosaga 3?
3384480	3385480	And how good is it?
3385480	3386480	Okay, that's a question.
3386480	3387480	It's gonna take a second.
3387480	3388480	Yeah, it's gonna take a minute.
3388480	3389480	Alright.
3389480	3390480	Yeah, but, anyway.
3390480	3391480	Oh.
3391480	3392480	Do you have anything else?
3392480	3393480	Yes.
3393480	3394480	Okay.
3394480	3397440	For my birthday, people chipped in and got me surround sound.
3397440	3403200	So now I have 5.1 surround sound in my, uh, my living room with my widescreen TV and the
3403200	3404680	360.
3404680	3405680	It's awesome.
3405680	3406680	It's awesome.
3406680	3407680	Is it pretty?
3407680	3412900	It's pretty, and they play Saints Row, and here, you know, I can hear the prostitutes
3412900	3416600	yelling behind me, so then I turn around and go beat their ass.
3416600	3417600	It's awesome.
3417600	3418600	Is it awesome like a hot dog?
3418600	3419600	Yes.
3419600	3420600	Like a hot dog.
3420600	3423600	Uh, Nintendo Maniac 64 says my friend has played it.
3423600	3426400	Funny Dale said I heard that game has a 6 hour cutscene.
3426400	3428320	I don't know if that would work.
3428320	3430040	DMN says it blows ass.
3430040	3431040	Really?
3431040	3432040	Why?
3432040	3433040	Well, he may not be talking.
3433040	3438160	He may just be talking, responding to somebody else again.
3438160	3443420	Somebody may have asked him, you know, what do you think about, you know, colonoscopies?
3443420	3445240	He might have been responding to that question.
3445240	3452200	Ranma said if Reggie comes out with a 40, he better have cornrows.
3452200	3456920	Sephiroth1215 says Xenosaga is $30 at Circuit City this week, for those of you guys that
3456920	3457920	like deals.
3457920	3458920	I already bought it.
3458920	3459920	I just haven't played it yet.
3459920	3468400	I actually was a moron and didn't get Xenosaga 2 when it came out, so I have to order that
3468400	3471480	and wait to play that before I can actually play Xenosaga 3.
3471480	3473800	DMN is saying Xenosaga 3 is garbage.
3473800	3474800	Is what?
3474800	3475800	It's garbage.
3475800	3476800	Fuck you.
3476800	3477800	It's blue hair.
3477800	3482240	I got a half blue hair.
3482240	3486040	Is it possible that the game might suck even though the first two were good?
3486040	3488040	Well, again, I haven't played the first two.
3488040	3489480	I haven't played two.
3489480	3495720	I really like the first one mainly because I like playing stuff with the storyline and
3495720	3502280	I don't care if the storyline is bad, kind of, because I really like the art in 3.
3502280	3504920	Do you like 5 hour miniseries for cutscenes?
3504920	3506720	If so, it sounds like you'll love it.
3506720	3507720	Oh yes.
3507720	3509360	I like a game that plays itself.
3509360	3510360	I do.
3510360	3511360	I was playing...
3511360	3513240	It's a movie that you interact with.
3513240	3514240	It's fun.
3514240	3515240	You press the A button once in a while and you're good.
3515240	3522040	By the way, with actual game news, Exo 6 is taking place in Barcelona on the 27th, 28th
3522040	3523040	of September.
3523040	3524040	Okay.
3524040	3527080	I bet you there's going to be big news out of that.
3527080	3533440	They're expected to announce new franchises from Bungie.
3533440	3536840	Well it's probably stuff for Halo 3.
3536840	3540440	And yeah, fun stuff.
3540440	3544200	I have one last little tidbit here that's being sent to a private message in chat.
3544200	3548440	There's a rumor going around that a Wii tech demo of sorts is going to come with a Wii
3548440	3549440	remote purchase.
3549440	3552440	It's just a rumor, but that might be interesting.
3552440	3553680	Some of that stuff you saw at E3...
3553680	3554680	That's cool.
3554680	3555680	I collect tech demos.
3555680	3560080	I actually have like five of the old PlayStation tech demos.
3560080	3561080	We want to see something crazy.
3561080	3564240	Go back and look at the old tech demos on the PlayStation and they look pretty damn
3564240	3568080	good, even by today's standards.
3568080	3571600	See, Dark Sakura can't say something nice about Sony once in a while.
3571600	3572600	It was a PlayStation.
3572600	3573600	Stop hating.
3573600	3577120	And remember, the PlayStation was born from the Super Nintendo.
3577120	3578700	In a way, yeah.
3578700	3580440	So huh.
3580440	3583840	All right, boys and girls, that's going to bring this edition of Orange Launch Radio
3583840	3584840	to a close.
3584840	3587520	Thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening to us tonight.
3587520	3591520	We really appreciate the fact that you guys tune in to us and support independent radio.
3591520	3592520	You guys rock.
3592520	3595440	Now we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.
3595440	3596960	And we'll start off with Drunami.
3596960	3600960	Drunami, thank you for being here tonight, as always.
3600960	3603360	And what's your final thought for tonight?
3603360	3604680	No poo.
3604680	3605680	Thanks.
3605680	3607280	Chris, your final thought for tonight?
3607280	3609360	My final thought is I love you guys.
3609360	3611440	And I'm sorry for making this place so random.
3611440	3612440	No, we love you too.
3612440	3613440	Thank you for being here.
3613440	3614440	Random is fun.
3614440	3615440	Yeah.
3615440	3616440	Old school listeners especially love it.
3616440	3617440	OK.
3617440	3619240	So Loki, your final thought?
3619240	3624080	I'm just going to take a tomorrow off and hopefully we'll play some more games this
3624080	3625080	week.
3625080	3626080	I want to take tomorrow off.
3626080	3627080	I want to take tomorrow off.
3627080	3628080	I want to take tomorrow off.
3628080	3629080	Oh, wait.
3629080	3630080	I didn't.
3630080	3631080	All right.
3631080	3633600	DarkSocker, your final thought?
3633600	3637720	I've had the best weekend ever.
3637720	3641200	And I owe it all to my bestest buddy right here.
3641200	3642200	Aww.
3642200	3643200	I think I threw up in my mouth.
3643200	3644200	Shut up.
3644200	3645400	I'm just kidding.
3645400	3647480	My final thought is I want potato chips.
3647480	3648480	Mmm.
3648480	3649480	Are there any left?
3649480	3650480	We're good.
3650480	3651480	I ate them all.
3651480	3652480	I hate you.
3652480	3653480	No.
3653480	3657080	We are starting a campaign to call them crisps and to call French fries chips.
3657080	3658080	They're not French.
3658080	3659080	I see.
3659080	3660080	I see.
3660080	3661080	They're chips.
3661080	3662080	Freedom fries?
3662080	3663080	No.
3663080	3664080	Fuck that.
3664080	3665080	They're chips.
3665080	3666080	OK.
3666080	3667080	They're chips.
3667080	3669380	I forgot to mention, and this is not that important, but it is news, firmware 2.81 came
3669380	3675520	out for the PSP, which allows you to use memory sticks that are larger than 4 gigs.
3675520	3676520	Hurrah.
3676520	3678600	And I have one more final thought for you all.
3678600	3679600	What?
3679600	3680600	Reject false icons.
3680600	3681600	Owned.
3681600	3684840	That is not pwnage.
3684840	3685840	That is homage.
3685840	3686840	All right.
3686840	3687840	That is pure ownage.
3687840	3688840	That is homage.
3688840	3691560	You know, imitation is the finest form of flattery, my dear.
3691560	3692560	All right.
3692560	3693560	We'll see you next week.
3693560	3698480	It's, if you thought tonight was crazy, next week, boys and girls, episode 200.
3698480	3699480	Woo hoo.
3699480	3700480	Brace yourselves.
3700480	3703560	Until then, I'm a very scared Rob Roberts.
3703560	3706080	And for Dark Soccer, Loki and myself, good night.
3706080	3707080	Bend over, Rob.
