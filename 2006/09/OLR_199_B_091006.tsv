20049	20489	Orange Lounge Radio
39491	42212	Sunday, September 17th, 2006 for episode 200.
42352	43853	If you can't join us live, there's always a podcast.
43873	44993	I know what we'll be talking about.
45213	45554	What's that?
45674	50015	We'll be talking about the Wii because the official announcement is going to be happening, what, this Thursday?
50395	52496	I bet Nintendo planned it that way.
53437	53837	They knew.
54617	55918	They did it just for us.
59586	64530	I want Reggie to come out on stage with his 40 and go, this one's for OLR!
65090	66211	My bitches!
67392	68953	I am nobody's bitch.
70134	74578	I will, however, whore myself out for... Yeah, but who needs a Nintendo press conference to have Wii News?
75218	76799	Exactly, you don't need Wii News.
77280	83304	You can do what some sites did and tell people, hey, guess what, we got big freaking news coming!
84215	88112	It's 12.01 in the morning and then you find out, guess what?
88874	92917	It's something that we pretty much already knew, that the Wii chips were well under production.
93337	99281	But IBM came out and confirmed that, that it's been in production since the beginning of this quarter.
99561	104504	And for those of you who are not savvy in the calendar, that means July.
105245	113811	And so that the actual first shipments of the chips are in Nintendo's hands, and that the Wii is well underway for launch.
114171	117793	Whenever that is, of course, we'll know that in a few days.
117953	118694	November, though, right?
118954	119675	We know that for sure.
119715	128562	Well, yeah, it's November, but you know, I'm still not whole... You never know, they could just come and say, You've been punked!
128882	131484	It's fucking... It's coming out tomorrow!
131544	133826	As long as we're not juiced, I'm okay with that.
134567	136328	So, alright.
137669	138070	It's fine.
139070	142033	Alright, and to the site's credit, you know...
142754	147720	I know the hype machine got way out of control, but they didn't know that people were going to run in on Dig and all this crazy stuff.
147740	149282	I mean, people went wild with this.
149642	151504	There's going to be news soon, you know.
152125	155008	Heck, we already told you guys, the Wii is coming out soon.
155569	156189	Exactly.
157607	161671	Alright, well, definitely one thing that will be coming to the Wii that is a little bit of a surprise.
162491	173180	Not usually the type of game you think about when you think about Nintendo, at least I don't, but Splinter Cell Double Agent does appear that it's going to be a launch title, at least that's what IGN reported earlier this week.
173640	182868	The Wii version, Splinter Cell Double Agent, was based on the PlayStation 2 and GameCube builds, and it will fully utilize the unique control system that the Wii has.
183288	189749	Of course, nothing specific has been given on the control system yet, but I'm sure we will know more as time moves on.
190989	197430	Examples that have been given as possible ideas that the Wiimote could be used to pick locks and cute little things like that.
197470	200431	So that should be fun for those of you guys that are into the Splinter Cell series.
200991	208392	If you do have a Wii and you just don't want that new finicky controls and stuff from the Wii version, you can just get the GameCube version.
209092	209613	Sounds good to me.
210453	211753	Well, speaking of...
213349	222457	I have an announcement to make.
225239	225440	What?
226701	230284	I am really fond of burritos.
231845	233267	You're burrito-sexual, huh?
233507	234368	I'm burrito-sexual.
234488	234908	That's hot.
236570	236830	Alright.
237971	239072	No, really, I, uh, no.
239995	240515	Maybe one day.
242056	243037	Anyway, release dates.
243077	243637	How about that?
245138	251601	On the 11th in the UK, we have LEGO Star Wars 2, the opening, the original trilogy, coming up for everything.
252822	253903	And I'm not kidding.
254003	254883	It's coming up for everything.
255103	255703	Except for PC.
255824	256684	No, even PC.
257384	258225	It's coming up for everything.
259485	261026	And then, that's it.
262367	263287	I'm serious.
264588	265909	I'm looking at that and it's all...
266987	268729	Hope you're a Star Wars fan.
268909	269729	Okay, I'm kidding.
269749	271371	There's actually a bunch of stuff on the 15th too.
272251	293708	We have 50 Cent Bulletproof on PSP, Ace Combat Zero, The Belkan War, Broken Sword, The Angel of Death, Call of Juarez, Faces of War, GTR2, Joint Task Force, NASCAR 07, yay, Nightwatch, Passport 2, dot dot dot, Pro Stroke Golf, I love that name, Pro Stroke, Golf World Tour 2007,
295347	308210	Rome, Total War, Alexander, Secret Files, Tunguska, Steambot Chronicles, Super Bike Racing Challenge, Tekken Dark Resurrection, which I have and it's freaking rad, and Yakuza.
308590	312691	On the 16th, I'll be getting Suikoden V. Sweet.
313011	314092	That's a pretty good lineup there.
314292	316052	I just want to share this real quick from chat.
316172	319833	SSJ100Matt says, the Wii rumors are like the US terror threat.
320193	322594	We don't know when it will happen, but it will happen soon.
324142	325243	That's a good analogy.
325263	329645	If you want to join our chat room and get funny little gems like that, it's orangelawntrader.com.

334328	338050	Of course, they are also getting LEGO Star Wars 2, the original trilogy.
338991	340912	Some stuff also coming out.
341192	345615	We've got, of course, the good Bomberman on PSP.

456692	457412	Evangelion.
457532	458553	I said it, didn't I?
458633	459293	Yes, you did.
459393	462133	Kotsetsu no Girlfriend Special Edition.
462233	464374	Another Eva dating sim?
464394	464754	What the hell?
464774	467815	That's coming out September 15th.
467835	468655	No, no, no, no.
468775	470835	I have one of the Evangelion dating sims.
470895	472155	I have one of the ones on Saturn.
472175	474796	No, those are so hot.
474936	476716	No, hot.
476736	478377	They're dating sims with combat sequences.
478397	479937	All right.
480626	481447	That's all I got.
482287	483508	I did, however, get to end the world.
483628	484229	It was fantastic.
484329	485870	That's all I got for you guys this week.
486110	489033	You know what I need to borrow for the Saturn?
489173	490934	I need to borrow a stall.
491434	492355	That game was awesome.
492715	493116	I love that.
494016	494657	I have a stall.
495117	495538	Ooh.
496819	501302	Anyway, speaking of good games, because a stall was freaking rad.
502283	503584	And this will interest Chris.
504905	509429	Kingdom Hearts 2 is eventually coming out in the U.K.,
510836	511436	Wee!
512757	514078	No, dear, the wee is not out yet.
516679	518380	That suddenly made me think of Mitch Hedberg.
519080	520120	He's like, wee!
520381	522682	When you're having fun, you mention yourself and other people!
523322	523582	Wee!
523962	528845	Anyway, Kingdom Hearts 2 is on its way to Europe very soon.
529925	530886	You will like it!
531106	531986	It's cute!
532526	533367	It really is!
533767	534067	Axel!
534207	534407	Axel!
536168	537809	I think we've got it memorized by now.
539595	540276	Ha ha.
540696	542758	They don't get that yet unless they imported it.
543218	544719	They will, believe me, they will.
544879	549803	Okay, back to the news before I'm so rudely interrupted by Mr. Junami in the corner.
550364	551024	Go eat a donut.
552505	557809	Well, yeah, but there's a difference between your helping and Junami helping.
558090	559811	That's because I always forgive you because you're cute.
560752	562513	Anyway, she just watched the movie.
562553	562893	And I'm not?
563354	565475	Back to the news, hello.
565495	566336	Okay, okay.
566798	567519	Yeah, you're a boy.
567539	568019	You don't count.
568479	568759	Anyway.
570821	576244	To our friends in the UK, it will actually be coming out on September 29th.
576684	583048	It came out last December in Japan, and we got it this year a few months ago.
584149	586870	But honestly, get the game.
587291	588271	When it is out, get it.
588812	589872	It's fantastic.
590913	592374	Lots of great gameplay.
592534	595696	But make sure that you do Agrabah and the Pride Lands.
596366	602369	Make sure that you do them, because Jamie decided she was going to skip those two places, and now can't get back to them.
602790	603270	A.K.A.
603290	604291	you fucked yourself.
604711	608453	I did, so I have to start over from Dan's game, because he's right where I am, only he did those two parts.
608893	609153	Winner.
610514	612115	Who the hell skips areas?
613196	614616	I thought that I was going the right way.
614636	617298	It gave me a choice.
617498	620760	I chose the one I wanted to do pirates, and I wanted to do... You chose wrong.
620860	624202	Hey, I wanted to do pirates in Halloween Town, so you shut up, sir.
626790	627571	Barbossa Barbossa
647647	653869	Okay, that came from when we were riding Pirates of the Caribbean the second time through when we were singing with the whole ride, annoying the people in front of us.
654709	660670	And then Barbossa's up on the Wicked Wench, so we decided to call him Dreamboat Barbie.
663791	664151	Okay.
664692	666712	Anyway, guys, get the game.
667452	669733	September 29th, you will not be disappointed.
672534	672894	Anyways.
673254	673654	And Rob...
679185	688500	Anyway, and as far as also other stuff... Okay, these people are giggling and driving me nuts.
689281	690603	Vice City Stories...
691921	696664	and Grand Theft Auto by City Stories will not be going out until November in the UK.
697965	702828	It was supposed to be out October 20th and now it's been pushed back to November 3rd.
703729	706431	That's also another good game if you're into the GTA series.
706471	708172	It actually is a really good addition to PSP.
709092	710333	My man's been pretty happy with it.
710653	714456	And it's also delayed in the United States too, November 1st.
714896	716497	No, I was referring to Liberty City Stories.
717658	717738	Oh.
717758	717798	Oh.
718557	720999	Wait, was the story about Liberty City?
721019	721119	No.
721219	721820	Oh, okay.
722320	728424	I mean, if it's anything like Liberty City... You were about to say Liberty Shitty, I think you were.
728585	729145	No!
729165	729785	Hey!
729865	731026	It's my game, bitch!
731707	736931	I'm saying if it was anything like Liberty City Stories, because Dan was playing that game all the time, keeping me awake.
737151	737331	I hear...
741342	743684	I'm not a big fan of Grand Theft Auto.
743844	755532	I understand why it's so freaking amazingly popular, but I think I might actually get suckered into playing Saints Row, because as we've all found out, I easily succumb to peer pressure, hence why I'm playing Final Fantasy XI again.
756373	757434	We'll probably go to Saints Row, too.
757454	760556	It's a fun, casual game, where you casually beat up workers.
760576	761056	I like casual.
761336	763078	I like beating up workers.
763818	764959	Anyways, so...
765529	768071	Yeah, delayed in the United States until November 1st.
768311	771033	That sucks because I was really looking forward to play that in October.
771573	773374	I'll just play some more Liberty City stories.
773594	775595	Speaking of delays, Forza 2.
776236	778117	It's been rumored to be delayed to 2007.
778337	781799	This is coming straight from the development team.
784581	788984	Their quote is, I think we've always said that it will appear in our...
789724	790245	Day of Forza
809395	813196	It's rumored, let me put it this way, it's not coming out when it was supposed to.
813216	821498	Because this is straight, you know, I actually, when I saw this story, I, you know, called my Microsoft rep and asked him when the fuck this game's coming out.
822039	823459	And it's to be announced right now.
823499	828400	It was in November, I think the 15th, and now it's being pushed back even further.
828520	832541	So, we're supposed to know the official date in a couple weeks, so that should be interesting.
834102	834162	Um...
834696	835917	What was the other game I was going to mention?
835977	844283	Crackdown was another game that was slated for the end of, or actually middle of October, and that's been delayed to be announced now.
844623	847605	So now the only Microsoft game coming out in October, Fusion Frenzy 2.
850396	867301	Speaking of delays on the Xbox, if you were the one person that was looking forward to Scramble coming onto Xbox Live Arcade this week, sorry, but you have to wait one more week because there were some last-minute things that had to be cleaned up with Scramble, and it's now going to be released this week.
867361	870282	Probably by the time you hear this podcast, it's already on the marketplace.
870542	872763	For those of you folks listening live, it'll be out this Wednesday.
873283	879345	So, you know, Microsoft has this big Xbox Live Arcade promotion thing going on where they're trying to release new stuff every Wednesday.
879704	881364	So they had to put something out this Wednesday.
881444	883145	So what did we get instead of Scramble?
883565	893628	We got a brand new Uno deck featuring cards from Project Gotham Racing 3 for 100 points.
896629	899230	I bet less people will be buying this than Scramble.
899950	900590	Well, I don't know.
900710	902630	Actually, there's a lot of Uno horse out there.
903111	904071	Some people are pretty hardcore.
904111	904611	They're Unos.
904671	905451	So I don't know.
906111	907272	I'm not a big Scramble fan.
907612	907952	It doesn't
908638	908898	DarkSakura.com
924130	927675	Speaking of things coming out for the 360, Japan is actually getting lucky.
927995	932762	You might remember when the console launched over Japan, they didn't get a core unit.
932882	935305	They basically just had the premium unit and that was it.
935766	941734	Well, now the 360 core is making its way over to Japan and they're getting a few additions to it.
942414	946017	1.
942715	946017	The price point is going to be less than what it is in the United States.
946097	955083	It's only going to be 29,800 yen, which is around about $255, which is about 40 bucks less than what we're paying for it now.
957065	966051	And actually, what's kind of neat about it is the core pack will include two games, 99 Nights and Project Gotham Racing 3 as well.
966571	967592	So that's pretty cool.
967993	971576	Also, the hard drives are supposed to be sold around $85 there, too.
971696	975499	So, you know, overall, they're getting a pretty good discount.
975759	977981	I wish we'd get some bundles over here, but that's not going to be the case.
978562	978822	Hmm.
979823	981584	And all that's going to be available November 2nd.
982545	982886	All right.
983446	983786	Sounds good.
984527	986449	Well, speaking of...
988516	988776	and so on.
1012950	1014971	It'll be in euros.
1014991	1016672	That's 293 euros, by the way.
1017092	1019934	And it will come with two HD DVD movies.
1021335	1030640	Also, there's a rumor that the premium console bundle with the movie player will be coming out around 400 pounds.
1033038	1035139	and the speculations could even be as low as $3.75.
1036280	1038662	Why are we hearing more about this in Europe than we are in the U.S.?
1038682	1042764	Because the news has been very quiet on the HD DVD expansion here in the U.S.
1042844	1044626	Is Microsoft waiting for something?
1045206	1046287	X06?
1046327	1046847	When is that?
1047207	1047667	I don't remember.
1048048	1052070	Because this we speculated last week with the whole, you know, Halo 3 is coming out earlier in the year.
1052370	1055933	Does it seem like Microsoft's going to be holding a press conference soon where they start announcing a lot of this stuff?
1055993	1056373	I think so.
1057174	1057494	Interesting.
1057514	1061336	Because the other rumor, which we'll get into later, was another racing game.
1061616	1062257	Interesting.
1063757	1070280	Microsoft isn't really commenting on it as much yet and I guess it's for the same reason that we're not seeing much on it over here.
1071121	1077224	But it's really looking like they're actually trying to now really take advantage of the UK market is what it seems like.
1081046	1082467	I just want to point this out in chat.
1082547	1084348	The chat is on this big kick right now.
1084388	1086689	I never understand when the chat room gets on this thing and they
1087082	1088503	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1110652	1111693	Oh, that makes sense.
1112633	1113374	This just in.
1113774	1117776	When people buy the Oblivion Horse Armor, they will buy the PGR deck in Uno.
1118276	1118777	That's true.
1119077	1120057	Somebody's going to buy it.
1120157	1120938	Somebody will buy it.
1121418	1122479	But not me.
1122599	1122919	Sorry.
1123059	1128082	Uno's cool and all, but I don't need 100 points for new cards that are basically a commercial for another Microsoft game.
1128322	1130483	They need an Uno deck that's the Horse Armor.
1130944	1134405	It's showing off the Horse Armor to get people to buy the Horse Armor.
1134666	1135626	You were right, by the way, Jamie.
1135666	1136507	It's Nazgul Slayer.
1137867	1138268	Anyways.
1138428	1138708	What?
1140140	1143322	Some stuff that Japan is also going to be seeing a price drop in.
1143502	1144782	It's going to be the PlayStation 2.
1145703	1152066	And that's actually pretty interesting because I don't think any... Well, everybody else has been dropping the price of the PS2.
1152106	1157888	But the PS2 is going to be dropping to 19,980 yen, which is about $170.
1157988	1162851	So not too big of a drop, but still an okay drop.
1163411	1167373	And if I remember correctly, the... What was that...
1170064	1170525	I'm sorry.
1173327	1174347	That was the old price.
1174548	1175208	I'm an idiot.
1176849	1178150	It's okay, people make mistakes.
1178170	1178571	It's fine.
1179051	1180292	Yes, I should do my research.
1181173	1182414	I'm not allowed to make mistakes!
1182434	1185596	Just so you know, the dozens and dozens of people that listen to this show are going to be very upset at you.
1186417	1186757	I know.
1187858	1190079	That's okay, you can just give them the raspberry.
1190400	1193742	I'm sorry, the new suggested retail price for the PS2 in the...
1196351	1200252	I guess that might be their way of stealing the Wii announcement thunder, but whatever.
1200272	1202132	So yeah, that's going to be happening soon.
1202152	1207293	In case you know, you might be one of those people in Japan that hasn't bought a PlayStation 2 yet, which is ridiculous.
1224417	1226277	DarkSakura, what is the website of the week?
1249488	1252850	The website of the week is Gamer.org.
1252970	1255032	G-A-Y-M-E-R.org.
1256293	1259755	Um, I... Stop doing that face!
1260816	1263798	I'm talking to Junami, being a dork, as usual.
1264498	1266480	Um, it's actually, it was really cool.
1266560	1270122	I ran across this, um, just looking randomly.
1270883	1270963	Um...
1271992	1275775	It's a site basically for gay and gay-friendly gaming, pretty much.
1276616	1282740	In fact, to go ahead and read a little blurb off of the website, it says, you know, why do you need a gay gamer site?
1283001	1288945	The truth is, in the gaming community, there are some pretty staunchly homophobic players, and Gamer.org is about having... Yeah, Drew Nami.
1289225	1289706	Yeah.
1290046	1291187	Who makes faces.
1291727	1293989	It's about having fun without hearing the bashing.
1294850	1300494	And that, you know, I like what it says here, so I give this site to you as a safe haven where gaming is the focus, not hate.
1301175	1308761	There's actually a World of Warcraft guild on here that's on the Blackwing server, their alliance, called Alternatives with an alter-native.
1309442	1310022	It's pretty cool.
1310723	1311684	But I've looked at the site.
1311704	1316568	They've got some core views, gaming news.
1317749	1319891	It's a pretty well put together site.
1319971	1325716	I'd say not overly a lot to look at, but the information is great.
1325816	1328458	I love just reading over the community there.
1329013	1336300	I only have one complaint about this site, and that's when you go over the drop-down menus, I don't like the little tinkle noise.
1337521	1338742	I don't know what else to call it.
1339002	1343326	It's fairy dust spreading all over your computer as you visit the site.
1343407	1347130	It's this high-pitched little noise, and I'm like, are you ganging my computer?
1347310	1349112	Well, actually, I don't need... I'm in your computer.
1349855	1351496	and your computer gating you up.
1351957	1355279	I have to give a shout out to a couple other, although that is a good site, I have visited that site.
1355299	1360804	I have to give a shout out to a couple other gay friendly gaming sites because, you know, a couple years ago there weren't any.
1361104	1364226	So it's really nice to see these, you know, gay gamer sites that are awesome.
1364266	1368109	And one of them I've been visiting a lot recently because they have a hilarious blog.
1368149	1368490	I love it.
1368530	1372173	It's gaygamer.net and they have a hilarious blog there.
1372193	1376536	They've been photoshopping Nintendudes is their latest thing going on and they have like
1376877	1379379	Nintendo's Twink Edition, and things like that.
1379539	1380619	It's silly, but it's funny.
1381000	1381600	To me, it's funny.
1382321	1383441	And they got some forums there, too.
1383461	1386964	And I also have to mention Gamer Experimentations is another forum I've posted on before.
1386984	1389085	They have a semi-active community over there.
1389385	1393688	And when that whole World of Warcraft guild thing was going down a couple months ago,
1394316	1396237	Very, very active discussion going on over there.
1396357	1397437	So, very cool.
1398618	1407541	Speaking of gay and World of Warcraft, some of the sound clips have come out for the, they've leaked to the internet somehow from the beta or I don't know what.
1407861	1412883	Some of the sound clips of some of the new races, including Blood Elves and Draanes.
1413103	1421526	So, now, I'm not saying that the Blood Elves are gay, but here's a clip of what one of the things the Blood Elves says, and you be the judge.
1422128	1425510	Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like me?
1425830	1426571	Oh my god!
1428792	1429273	Rob?
1429473	1430253	No, I don't know.
1430313	1434596	You must now take back that homophobic joke, because I am making one of those.
1435196	1435657	Alright?
1435737	1437077	That was awesome.
1439479	1443722	You know, there's some great sound clips as well, and that's just to the iceberg.
1443962	1444402	But then get this.
1444887	1447990	The female blood elf seems to be a little bit of a valley girl.
1448070	1448370	I don't know.
1448390	1449030	You tell me on this one.
1449090	1450912	I went to Undercity to get a facial.
1451573	1453314	Have you seen these people?
1454055	1458158	I said, you don't have a lower jaw and you're going to give me a facial?
1458999	1459739	She got mad.
1460220	1461380	At least I think she did.
1461641	1463782	You ever heard someone talk without a lower jaw?
1467105	1468907	She sounded like a murloc.
1470408	1471709	Or getting her hair done.
1472427	1477648	at a troll shop and winding up with a mohawk and a frickin' bone in her nose.
1478028	1478668	Getting her hair did.
1478688	1478928	Killed it.
1479048	1479868	Killed it.
1479988	1480468	Killed it.
1480488	1486529	Although the female Draenei voices are also funny, asking if gnomes come with vibrate functions.
1488050	1489170	Hey, I haven't gotten there yet.
1489230	1490010	I haven't gotten there yet.
1490210	1490870	Come on, play it.
1491730	1492490	Stinkin' jerk.
1492570	1493991	Here's the Draenei female.
1494191	1495591	Do gnomes have a vibrate setting?
1496151	1497411	I did not call that.
1497491	1498171	Hey, shut up.
1498191	1499672	We couldn't hear that over your bitching.
1500332	1501712	Do gnomes have a vibrate setting?
1502444	1503084	I'm just curious.
1504164	1505425	I did not mean to call that.
1532734	1533254	I love this planet.
1533274	1535236	I come here, I see cow and chicken and ride little horses.
1535396	1536257	This planet has everything.
1536277	1536817	Oh my god, it's balky.
1536837	1536957	Oh no.
1537037	1537958	What was that show?
1537998	1539919	It was on Perfect Strangers.
1563388	1565868	In old country, boobs did not fly free.
1566028	1568069	They were disciplined, structured.
1568469	1570289	That's why we have Uta's brassieres.
1570749	1572030	They hold boobies in place.
1572610	1574490	In Soviet Russia now.
1576010	1579791	In the world of Warcraft, Dronne drink you.
1579851	1580231	I don't know.
1581971	1582271	Silly.
1584252	1585972	Cultural influence confusion.
1586192	1591853	Male Draenei, their dance animation is the internet phenomenon Tunak Tunak Tunak dance.
1592179	1592759	That's awesome.
1592860	1597223	And Blood Elf Males do have the Napoleon Dynamite dance going for them.
1598203	1598343	Ew.
1598644	1599384	That's great.
1599905	1601326	Just to add to their sexual ambiguity.
1601586	1605188	Even though Napoleon Dynamite is kind of last year's news, that's kind of awesome.
1605609	1606689	I hate Napoleon Dynamite.
1606710	1607790	You hate Napoleon Dynamite?
1607810	1610993	I'm like the one person in the world that thought that movie was the best thing in the world.
1611013	1611493	No, actually I know a lot.
1611513	1611813	It's anti-human.
1611833	1615856	The problem is that the movie got so hyped up, by the time a lot of people saw it, they were like, that's it?
1616377	1621160	No, there's only one thing in the world that needs to live up to the hype, and that's Snakes on a Plane.
1622239	1622739	And it did.
1623460	1625101	Snakes on a Plane was fantastic.
1625421	1626041	Haven't seen it.
1628643	1629363	Lord help us all.
1630304	1632825	Yeah, give me my microphone, thank you.
1633505	1635306	God, I fucking hated that movie.
1635466	1636467	That movie was great.
1637728	1638488	It was dumb.
1638708	1639128	Anyways.
1640669	1646412	Speaking of really stupid things... In World of Warcraft, Planes on Snakes!
1648253	1649714	Give me my joke book back!
1650495	1650875	Anyways.
1651744	1664172	Speaking of really dumb, dumb, dumb speculation, there was a, I guess, a story posted about how some cryptologists have figured out the Wii date.
1665193	1666113	And here's how they did it.
1666874	1668054	Roman numerals.
1668435	1669816	Oh, God, I heard about that.
1669916	1670776	Roman numerals.
1670856	1675980	Because, you see, a W is actually, looks like two Vs, which would equal 10.
1676700	1678241	And the two I's would be two.
1678661	1680723	Therefore, October 2nd.
1681630	1687853	Therefore, they are stupid is my opinion on the whole thing.
1688613	1694556	Look, with all due respect to the sites that ran this story, why is this news?
1695316	1697737	Why is this news?
1698298	1699518	This is not news.
1700979	1709403	Me coming over there to strangle you for running stories like this that perpetuate these stinking rumors, that would be news.
1710555	1714882	That is great video game journalism when I come strangle you for writing these stories around the internet.
1716224	1716664	Thank you.
1717265	1718788	That just broke my ear.
1719178	1719718	No, you're welcome.
1720118	1721039	I got you back for earlier.
1721119	1722720	Oh, no, I guess that was Jamie who did it earlier.
1722920	1723540	That was me.
1723880	1724380	Traitor!
1725281	1725981	Traitor!
1726041	1730863	I have to say this, because in the chat room here, I'm not sure if this is Cage or Kage.
1731043	1731483	It's probably Kage.
1731503	1731904	Kage.
1732584	1736285	Snakes, or, I'm sorry, whoops, that's not what I was, that's not the comment I wanted to read.
1736686	1741428	Kage said this, World of Warcraft is YTMND with a level cap.
1742448	1744289	That's kind of a good way to sum it up.
1745710	1746530	I like that comment.
1750218	1750518	Nothing.
1750578	1752559	It's about what made the movie irated.
1753780	1754000	Rob.
1754380	1754560	Yes.
1754660	1754861	Rob.
1755021	1755181	Yes.
1755341	1755541	Rob.
1755961	1756161	Rob.
1756621	1757042	Traitor.
1761024	1762204	So is it my turn now?
1762284	1763665	You want to report this on your blogs?
1763725	1765166	I'll give you a worldwide exclusive.
1765906	1768807	Sky leaves Orange Lounge Radio right before episode 200.
1768847	1769048	Amazing.
1769168	1770008	And no one cares.
1771549	1772209	Yeah, no one cares.
1772269	1772849	No one will run it.
1773090	1774890	And we replace them with a flask of coffee.
1776691	1777772	You have to understand, no one...
1779013	1782415	No one's going to believe that you left the show until IGN reports it anyways.
1784557	1787419	Yes, next week I'm going to be... That person has to circulate a one-up.
1787619	1792503	That's the big news for next week's show, is that I'm replaced with a blood elf male, actually.
1792543	1795925	Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like me?
1798047	1802450	Anyway... Okay.
1803090	1804451	Back to the news.
1804671	1806193	My God, you people are random.
1806733	1808074	I blame Drew Nami's presence.
1809204	1812127	Anyway, as he bowels, bowels?
1814228	1817311	Oh my god, I just cleaned the carpet, Drew!
1818632	1819813	Aren't you paper trained?
1820114	1820654	Please.
1821195	1821415	Okay.
1822356	1831684	Our dear friends at Squeenix are being sued by Softworld International for 3.78 million dollars.
1833505	1834046	Apparently...
1835834	1836174	D.M.N.
1836514	1837635	has a new nickname for Drew.
1837675	1837915	Poonami
1867093	1867733	How old are we?
1869094	1871115	He said poo.
1871375	1873276	Does this mean I have to team up with Poo Eater?
1873856	1876538	Hey, Drew, are these... Then we won't have to worry about a mess.
1876678	1877718	Poo Maker and Poo Eater.
1877758	1879279	Are these poo jokes making you angry?
1879919	1880620	Very angry.
1880700	1881740	Then you know what time it is.
1884201	1885222	Sigh.
1896571	1897391	FUs of the week time.
1898732	1904333	My FU of the week goes towards the really... No, no, no, no, no, it wasn't that.
1904794	1909195	I actually do not quite recall what it was I was so angry about because I was really freaking angry.
1910335	1911936	Was it when you called me from downtown earlier?
1912116	1915697	No, it... Well, okay, this is my... And I hate to resort to traffic.
1915737	1916357	This is what it was.
1917218	1920799	Fucking person who almost ran into me while I was on the 80.
1920919	1923099	Are you on your car?
1923119	1924520	I just want to go back to you.
1925316	1932018	No, it was some dumbass was swerving to avoid another dumbass and nearly ran into me and I swerved.
1932038	1939960	I managed to stay in my lane, but like five people behind me had to pull into the side because they were all swerving.
1941701	1945722	And then all the traffic on the Bay Bridge, since they did all the work on it.
1947459	1948580	Aren't they done with the work, though?
1948840	1950901	They're supposed to be, but it was still stupid.
1960688	1962029	I personally dislike you now.
1962649	1965091	But I'm also lying.
1965771	1966091	Loki.
1967352	1967832	Anyway.
1969614	1972535	F you to all those
1974608	1975188	DarkSakura.com
2005576	2009479	My FU of the week goes to the amazing off-topicness of tonight's show.
2009519	2010100	That's amazing.
2010820	2013703	Because we're going to have a lot of new listeners tonight thanks to the DDR stuff.
2013843	2021990	And then I would also say FU to just how crazy my work has been.
2022191	2024653	Next week is going to suck and it makes me want to cry.
2025594	2027636	But it's a job.
2028076	2028556	Pays the rent.
2028837	2029337	What can I say?
2030498	2031359	Chris, do you have any FUs?
2034478	2038059	My FU goes to whoever invented the United States.
2039740	2047362	He sucks and needs to get resurrected and die again because, as most of you know, my girlfriend lives in Wisconsin.
2047482	2048923	I live in Northern California.
2049783	2050604	I can't walk there.
2051484	2052264	It makes me sad.
2052664	2053485	I miss her a lot.
2054305	2055585	It makes me sad that she's not here.
2056325	2057466	What happened to the pedestrians?
2058366	2059226	Fuck pedestrians!
2060107	2060927	Fuck America!
2061087	2062227	I want her right here!
2062247	2063748	I have this.
2065066	2073329	I thought it was going to be a political rant, and then it was just a F you to the distance, my heart aches, gush, gush, gush, cute.
2073350	2077211	You should have heard me trying to get rid of her on the phone.
2077291	2082493	Like, not get rid of her, but when I was talking to her on the phone during the break, I was going, I miss you, I love you.
2082513	2083534	She's like, I miss you too.
2083594	2086455	Okay, I gotta go, I miss you.
2086475	2087235	I'm not that sad.
2087255	2088416	I just threw up in my mouth.
2088436	2089216	Shut up, I'm a girl.
2090157	2091217	All right, Drew, any F yous?
2091717	2092958	All right, F you to...
2093865	2102487	I have friends of mine who call in on their 21st and ask me to roll a DC-15 check against their fortitude to see if they're drunk.
2102927	2104047	I shit you not.
2105488	2108949	He had me roll to see if he was drunk on 4 Rubber Coats.
2108969	2111189	Roll the dice to see if I'm getting drunk!
2111869	2112509	Yeah, you are!
2112909	2114650	Are there any girls there?
2114790	2115370	Yeah!
2115850	2118991	If there's any girls there, I wanna do them!
2121148	2122089	God, kill me now.
2122829	2125550	And there were, and I did, but I wasn't there.
2126710	2128931	I was playing Ogres.
2129171	2130291	Is that it?
2130591	2132692	You're not there, you're getting drunk!
2133432	2137414	Also, a big F you to Guild Drama on my server.
2137534	2138894	It really sucks ass.
2139274	2140915	Silverwing wanted to know if he failed, by the way.
2141795	2143395	He did fail his check.
2143936	2144576	His DC 15, he rolled an 8.
2151500	2151921	Wow.
2153042	2154703	You know, shows like this drive me to drink.
2156645	2158546	Games like this might drive me to drink, too.
2158607	2159147	I'm not sure.
2159247	2160288	No, it might be okay.
2160789	2163351	It's a game coming out from Ubisoft, and it's called Alive.
2163851	2166594	It's supposedly going to be coming out in 2007.
2167595	2168896	It was first talked about in March 2006.
2170057	2174261	What makes this interesting is that this game has been referred to as an Action Plus title.
2175041	2176202	It's a genre that...
2177063	2188851	The International Herald Tribune writer Doreen Carvajal has spun into Ubisoft's attempt to focus on what the writer says is the feminine side of gaming.
2189952	2195837	In other words, the reason is because Alive is more oriented toward drama, more life in characters, more depth.
2196158	2200241	It's about surviving, but you can't resolve things by shooting only.
2200702	2206147	You see, Alive features characters who rely on their instincts and each other to endure after an earthquake.
2206767	2209069	So in other words, boring!
2209450	2211972	So apparently girls like boring games.
2212072	2212492	Who knew?
2212993	2213974	Fuck that noise!
2215155	2215415	Okay.
2217227	2218008	That was not nice.
2218348	2220289	I like killing things as much as a nice person.
2220409	2225253	In all seriousness, if Ubisoft wants to make the ultimate girl game, what should they be making?
2228996	2230257	A Lorena Bob at the MMO.
2234560	2235541	Next topic!
2236101	2239444	They need to make fucking Barbie, like, Horse Adventures 6.
2241165	2243607	You know, Barbie with a vengeance or something.
2245688	2246689	Barbie fucks you up.
2249454	2251676	No, it was a really good girl game, I thought.
2252376	2253277	It was for the computer.
2253757	2254037	Alice.
2254918	2255879	American McGee's Alice.
2256239	2257440	That was a fucking great game.
2257740	2258260	I love that.
2258921	2259341	Drugs.
2260502	2262744	Maybe if you're a girl smoking crack.
2264165	2267827	IGN ripping off OLR said Megzy and Chris is pro-lesbian too.
2268868	2269108	What?
2269508	2270009	What is that from?
2270029	2270789	For a game suggestion.
2271030	2271350	Oh, okay.
2271970	2272851	That's hot.
2272871	2273151	Anywho.
2276331	2281573	Speaking of games for girls, Dead Rising is supposed to be getting some download content here pretty soon.
2282353	2287376	Actually, they did get some download content, but there's going to be some coming to in-store kiosks as well.
2288096	2294639	If you actually check online, they do have on the marketplace a brand new costume, I guess.
2294859	2296499	Cold-Hearted Snake is what it's called.
2297260	2299060	No idea what that looks like because I haven't actually played it.
2299080	2300861	It looks like Paula Abdul.
2300981	2302362	No, it's a snake outfit.
2302962	2305443	Not like Solid Snake, but it looks like snake skin is your suit.
2305759	2306700	It's like a snakeskin suit.
2307040	2307881	Exactly.
2308761	2309562	So that's kind of cool.
2309842	2318028	And then in the in-store kiosks, they're supposed to be getting Accountant, Burgundy Wine, Pure White Suit, and Stripe.
2318388	2321911	And those are going to be available in keys in the brand new September kiosk disc.
2323312	2324873	So look for that pretty soon.
2325908	2327469	Project Gotham Racing 4
2353879	2379581	Because it's through this contest, or it's through the site that's talking about having a contest for designing the car And the winning design will be on Project Gotham Racing 4 Just like Test Drive Unlimited Well, and actually, neat news Sorry You know, Project Gotham 4, it's going to be in my house And it's going to annoy the crap out of me Just like its predecessors did
2380649	2383070	But there is some news.
2383190	2386132	Who of our listeners reads Vibe Magazine?
2388193	2394617	Yeah, not usually the best known thing for gaming news.
2395898	2404563	However, they had $150 under a description for the Wii in their last issue.
2405923	2408845	In fact, I'm looking at the image now.
2412306	2419412	It has down at the bottom just a little description about all the stuff that's going to be on it.
2419432	2437985	It says $150 www.nintendo.com So we're not sure if that's actually going to be just based off of rumors or if it's going to be more in the close to $300 range like we were hearing before.
2438005	2439466	I think it's a rumor.
2439526	2440227	I think it's
2441536	2444637	I think that they've posted unsubstantiated information.
2444697	2448558	I think it was just a placeholder that accidentally went to print that shouldn't have.
2448678	2449798	I don't think it means anything.
2450098	2454659	But of course, wasn't there those rumors saying that the Europe site said it was going to be 150 pounds?
2454679	2456200	150 pounds would be a lot more here.
2456220	2459241	Well, yes, but usually if it's $2.99 here, like look at the PlayStation 3, it's going to be $5.99 here, $5.99 pounds over there.
2459261	2459961	So, you know, possible.
2459981	2460421	I'm actually...
2469338	2472281	I think converting that would bring it up to at least the $200.
2472641	2475584	I know it's not possible, but can you imagine if they released that for $99?
2475624	2478187	That would be phenomenal.
2478807	2480669	It would fly off the shelves.
2481290	2482251	Everyone would own a Wii.
2483011	2484273	That would be awesome.
2484373	2486054	But even $199 is going to be pretty good.
2486615	2490639	But hey, you're going to know in a couple days anyway, so who cares?
2491926	2495989	Alright, well this is the part of the show where we open it up to you guys to call us and interact with us.

2523721	2524502	Damn, I'm good.
2524862	2526484	Yeah, you just had to trigger a finger there.
2527265	2530289	DJ Ranma, hey, I hear you're a snitch.
2532212	2533553	Well, what can I say?
2533633	2535295	Someone pays my bills.
2535755	2539879	My finger is floating over the hang-up button, so you better have some... Hey, don't hang up on him.
2539919	2541160	I veto hanging up on him.
2541220	2542521	You better have something good to say.
2542541	2549086	Well, I have a lot of good stuff to say, because, you know, if you was going to do that, I wasn't going to treat you to Dunkin' Donuts when you came to New York City.
2549466	2551108	Okay, then maybe I won't hang up on you.
2551148	2551968	What's on your mind, buddy?
2552809	2553670	Oh, a few things.
2553710	2558934	I want to say hi to everybody in the studio, and a special hello to the angel of death, Loki.
2559835	2560455	Hi.
2561789	2562769	Oh, I forgot to mention.
2563830	2564090	Yes.
2565231	2566011	This is kind of funny.
2566131	2569152	They had screenshots from Africa get posted this week.
2570133	2571853	Africa.
2571873	2573414	Can we figure out what the game's about yet?
2573834	2574054	Nope.
2574375	2575915	It's just pictures of animals.
2575975	2576876	It's about animal poo.
2577056	2577436	Hooray.
2577796	2578316	Africa.
2579557	2579917	All right.
2580357	2581938	What's on your mind, really, Ranma?
2582598	2586160	Well, I play DDR Supernova, and I'm in love.
2586940	2587180	Really?
2587200	2588861	What did you love about DDR Supernova?
2589517	2591197	I just love the eye candy to it.
2591238	2596839	I mean, the new videos, all the new characters dancing, especially Emmy's new costume.
2598179	2599340	Emmy's new costume.
2599740	2602761	What would you say is your favorite song in DDR Supernova?
2603841	2608622	I only got to play one song, and right now, I was floored by Centerfold.
2609602	2610603	Oh, the Captain Jack song.
2610963	2611183	Yes.
2611643	2614644	Alright, that's cool.
2615024	2617665	So are you going to be picking up the home version when it comes out for PS2?
2618305	2618805	Fuck yes.
2619173	2619854	Alright, sounds good.
2619874	2623136	You know, I hear you can make your own steps at home and then take them to the arcade.
2623156	2623636	It should be fun.
2624797	2628299	That would be awesome, but... It's like the old days.
2629640	2631741	Yeah, but the machines around here don't have memory cards.
2632502	2633002	Don't.
2633322	2633923	They need to get them.
2635164	2635984	We're working on it.
2636465	2636765	Alright.
2637925	2638866	Anything else on your mind, Ranma?
2639466	2641228	I beat New Super Mario Bros.
2641528	2645030	and Nintendo threw old schoolers a bone in the game.
2645490	2645911	Oh, what's that?
2647244	2650126	Wait until you get to the final level in the castle.
2650246	2651167	That's all I'm going to say.
2651787	2653228	Alright, sounds good.
2653888	2654929	Alright Ranma, we've got to let you go.
2654949	2655970	We've got to get more callers, okay?
2656190	2657170	Two more things, Ranma, I think.
2657250	2666116	Number one, I picked up Beatmania for $40 at Version Megastore and I'm calling out Drunami and Nintendo Maniac 64 for bad phone calls.
2666136	2666556	Come on.
2667076	2668917	I'm raising the bar here.
2669097	2670358	Come on, you can do better than me.
2670718	2671179	Oh dear.
2671959	2672819	Drunami, response?
2674781	2675181	It's on.
2677588	2678209	Bye, Ranma.
2678249	2678769	Have a good one.
2679009	2679650	Bye.
2680411	2683774	All right, we're going to go to another call here on the Skype line.
2684795	2685916	I'm going to answer it.
2686376	2687177	Rob, okay.
2687697	2688918	Africa, Africa.
2689259	2689719	Zebra Buzz.
2689739	2692041	All right, let's go to another call here on Orange Lounge Radio.
2692582	2693903	Hey, you're calling Orange Lounge Radio.
2693943	2695604	Who's this?
2695624	2696485	Hi, this is Solar Wing.
2696946	2697826	Hi, Solar Wing.
2697947	2699328	You've never called the show before, have you?
2699935	2703198	No, I'm a first-time actually live listener.
2703518	2706000	All right, we're popping someone's Skype cherry tonight.
2706020	2706741	That's awesome.
2706821	2709263	We're happy to have some new blood on the show tonight.
2709283	2709924	What's on your mind, buddy?
2711705	2712706	Actually, a few things.
2713227	2714888	First, the PS3 thing.
2715589	2718191	How many do you actually think will actually make it to Canada?
2718231	2721153	Because it says 400,000 to North America.
2721634	2722034	Oh, good point.
2722054	2727639	Does that necessarily mean anything about it just going to States or Canada or what?
2728522	2733507	That's a damn good point that I don't know if anyone's really thought of about how many of those machines are going to Canada.
2733527	2735529	Everyone assumed North America is just the United States.
2735549	2737571	It's kind of like, you know, Europe doesn't exist.
2737831	2739253	And Mexico, apparently.
2740654	2741715	I think Mexico is getting 350,000.
2742295	2747961	You want to know what's sad, my friend, is that probably Canada is getting about 10,000 of that.
2749335	2750015	Don't say that.
2751716	2752536	Are you a Sony fan?
2753197	2755537	No, I actually owe someone a PS3.
2755738	2757738	You owe someone a PS3?
2758259	2760319	Oh my god, you must have done something big.
2760840	2761820	This is what I want to know.
2762220	2763060	What did you do?
2763621	2768022	It is a Christmas present, wedding present, birthday present from two years.
2769443	2771644	Oh wow, so this is like a get out of presents.
2772364	2774305	Are you having to make up for presents you forgot?
2775467	2777108	No, he had a choice.
2777188	2779629	It was either Xbox 360 or PS3.
2779669	2783830	He chose the PS3 because he hates me.
2784551	2784871	I see.
2785631	2789893	But this is going to be a get-out-of-presence free pass for the next two years, apparently.
2790393	2790853	I hope so.
2791073	2791594	Wow.
2792154	2792974	That's a pretty big one.
2795342	2800425	Even so, I think that with the shipment coming out, it would be similar to what the other systems are.
2800446	2803648	There shouldn't be any type of region coding or any type of specification between.
2803668	2804468	No, no, not for Canada.
2804548	2810032	So I wouldn't see why you can't order one off of GameStop's site or something like that.
2810212	2817517	Yeah, you might be able to just order, you know, it might cost a little extra for shipping, but if Push came to shove, you could order one from a U.S.
2817597	2819118	website and just have it shipped to Canada.
2819707	2821108	Yeah, I could probably do that.
2821208	2825309	It's just $700 as it is, plus how much are the games?
2826330	2827610	Yeah, true.
2827630	2833273	We're talking $600 American, which is a little bit more in Canadian, although not much lately.
2833313	2835093	The dollars are equating pretty soon here.
2836074	2837454	What part of Canada are you from?
2838735	2840035	West Coast, near Toronto.
2840816	2841316	Near Toronto?
2841336	2841416	Yeah.
2841840	2844802	Wait, Toronto's not... Wait, they consider Toronto the West Coast?
2845423	2845703	Sorry.
2845763	2846984	I was like, wait a minute, wait a minute.
2847344	2847584	Okay.
2847964	2851127	Well, you can always, you know, dip in... I don't know how far of a drive you are from the U.S.
2851187	2853168	border, but, you know, you can always dip into the U.S.
2853208	2855710	and try some of the big Best Buys, you know, around the border.
2856010	2856611	Could be a thought.
2857171	2857812	Or you think so?
2857912	2858452	A lot of...
2860296	2865019	The distributors, you know, the national distributors are in California.
2865679	2874504	You know, if you order from any of the distribution sites or any of the other, maybe even the importers, you're still probably going to get a system fairly quickly.
2875785	2876765	As far as shipping is concerned.
2879287	2881828	My other question was about the new NTSs.
2882148	2882709	Yeah, what about them?
2883109	2884850	What do you think about them?
2885633	2886434	I'm getting a pink one.
2886654	2887274	End of story.
2888055	2888696	I like mine.
2889336	2891297	It's kind of dirty because it's been in my purse.
2891398	2892118	Wait, you have the white one?
2892578	2894580	Yeah, you have the virginal white one.
2896301	2898503	Do you think they'll actually fix that crack issue?
2898911	2900772	Oh, the whole, the cracking of the hinges?
2901192	2910595	I imagine because it was such a big deal on the blogs that they'll do something about it, but I don't know, what can you really do about the hinges without redesigning the whole setup of the system?
2910735	2911776	I know mine hasn't yet.
2911936	2916498	Yeah, I don't think they all have, but I hear the fats are cracking now too.
2916658	2919939	One of the blogs I was reading ran a story that their fat was cracking.
2920279	2925701	But you know, it takes one person with an internet site to have that happen and then, you know, it's all over the internet.
2925721	2928182	So I don't know exactly how rampant the cracks are.
2928822	2933264	I think that issue is less widespread than people are thinking.
2933664	2934464	Get the black one.
2934484	2935505	You won't be able to see the crack.
2935985	2936865	Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
2937066	2937686	Yeah, there you go.
2937746	2938146	There you go.
2938806	2941567	My last thing, I've played DDR once.
2942008	2942228	Yeah?
2942448	2944008	And I was looking at getting a PS2.
2944809	2945969	What should I get for DDR?
2947150	2948450	Get an ignition pad, first of all.
2948670	2950391	Yeah, make sure you get a good dance pad.
2950451	2955233	Although, well, if he's warming up to DDR, I'd say a $20 dance pad can hold him over to see if he likes the game.
2955506	2960174	Especially because you can play the basic songs on the cheapo pads.
2960274	2963901	Once you get into the harder stuff, though, it will start moving under your feet.
2964669	2969973	I would say by far the best home release for PS2 is Extreme 2, the most recent one, and that'll be the easiest one to find.
2970053	2976998	But you could probably get some of the oldies for like $20 American easily, like Max 2 and DDR Extreme.
2977018	2980060	And they're not bad, but DDR Extreme 2 is by far the best one.
2980360	2983563	Probably right after Supernova comes out, that will drop in price.
2983863	2986184	And who knows, maybe actually Supernova's going to be the best one.
2986244	2989487	I couldn't tell you until after I've played it, but it sounds like it's going to be pretty good.
2989867	3016732	but Extreme 2 has a lot of radio friendly songs and things you might have heard of before and not a bunch of crazy stuff that sometimes turns people off to DDR alright, well thanks not a problem, thank you so much for calling in have a good one buddy good luck with the Playstation 3 hunting that's gotta be a pain in the ass oh my god, oh you're a friend of Playstation 3 like Jamie, if I bought you a Playstation 3 you don't get anything else the rest of your life
3018237	3019958	That's okay.
3020559	3021419	You don't want a PlayStation 3.
3022300	3024202	If I gave you a PlayStation 3, you'd give it back.
3025082	3031427	No, if you gave me a PlayStation 3, honestly, I'd sell it on eBay for three times what it's worth and then I'd take us all to Disneyland.
3031447	3032688	Alright, you want to answer the next call, Jamie?
3032968	3034029	No, I decided not to.
3034249	3034689	Okay, I will.
3034749	3035270	No, it's funny.
3036010	3036210	What?
3036611	3036811	Yeah.
3037211	3040894	Africa, they rendered zebra genitalia.
3042115	3042655	Oh, yuck.
3042695	3043496	I'm going to throw up my mouth.
3043516	3044837	Alright, Jamie, answer the next call.
3045455	3047356	Hi, you've called Orange Lounge Radio.
3047436	3048237	Feel special.
3049317	3049718	Who are you?
3051839	3052639	Apparently they hung up.
3052719	3054340	They didn't feel so special.
3055961	3056482	Bastards.
3057182	3059103	They got you and decided to run the other way.
3060925	3062105	Alright, you want to try this one instead?
3062285	3062746	Fine.
3063946	3066368	Hi, you've called Orange Lounge Radio.
3066388	3069510	This guy's got a feminine voice.
3072406	3075368	No, I talk too much, so... Oh, that's right.
3075408	3077249	Yeah, so we're letting Jamie answer the calls.
3078530	3079951	Oh, I'm sorry.
3080892	3082093	I don't think you talk enough.
3082553	3083374	Alright.
3085335	3088958	Anyways... What's on your mind, my friend?
3089578	3092400	Well, something you guys have completely overlooked.
3093000	3096603	Next Saturday morning is the season premiere of Dance Revolution.
3098703	3100364	I don't think we overlooked it.
3100404	3101904	We just don't care, my friend.
3101944	3103224	We just don't care.
3103564	3104465	I will watch it.
3105785	3106925	I will subject myself.
3106965	3109306	This is the ultimate in video game journalism right there.
3109366	3111706	Self-sacrifice for the better of the community.
3111726	3116587	You know, I'm sure that the entirety of our radio listeners can hear you pointing at Loki.
3116607	3122309	Listen, I sacrificed myself to watch Viva Pinata, and that show sucked.
3122989	3126010	I watched the Viva Pinata clips on Xbox Live.
3126030	3126790	I thought it was cute.
3127233	3127714	You're stupid.
3129275	3129595	Jerk.
3129655	3135221	Alright, what else is on your mind, DMN?
3137984	3139165	I can't remember what else.
3139465	3147673	I know I was going to bug you guys with Dance Revolution, and the other thing slipped my mind, so I think we'll cut this one short and let you hang up on me.
3147953	3148754	Alright, sounds good.
3150336	3150616	Click.
3152970	3155931	Alright, I think we have time for about one more call here.
3155991	3161873	If you want to give us a call, you can call our username is Orange Lounge Radio, or you can call our Skype line.
3162033	3164213	It's 916-226-9067.
3165614	3166174	Megzy, call.
3168075	3169315	Megzy's supposed to call us.
3169675	3170575	Wasn't she the one that hung up?
3171195	3171476	No.
3172316	3172636	Megzy.
3172956	3173296	Let's try.
3173376	3173656	Hold on.
3173676	3175477	Jamie, are you going to answer this?
3175497	3175677	Yeah.
3176297	3177097	You better be Megzy.
3177117	3179098	Yeah, this is Megzy.
3179198	3179418	Yay!
3181817	3182458	Wow, hi.
3183058	3185099	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3185119	3186120	This must be Megzi.
3187100	3189282	This is Megzi.
3189322	3189682	Hey.
3189842	3191063	What's on your mind, Megzi?
3192463	3198146	Okay, first, anyone in the chat room who is listening, do not go to my genius site.
3198507	3200028	Do not look at my bad art.
3200488	3201248	It is not bad.
3202029	3203089	Megzi, you're kind of breaking up.
3203109	3203489	Be careful.
3204610	3206431	Okay, better?
3206751	3207772	Yes, better, much better.
3211744	3212144	Go to it.
3212204	3213044	Look at all of her art.
3213064	3213645	It's beautiful.
3214505	3216466	That was during the bonus segment.
3216486	3218006	Podcasters didn't hear it anyway.
3218206	3219807	Yeah, don't worry about it.
3219847	3221007	The majority of them won't go there.
3221427	3227249	The other thing is about the conference.
3228510	3229370	The Nintendo conference.
3230931	3231311	What about it?
3232831	3233691	Oh my gosh.
3233811	3234692	I have been waiting.
3234712	3238273	I am counting the hours until the press conference.
3238567	3239808	Are you a Reggie fangirl?
3241048	3243249	I am so totally a Reggie fangirl.
3243969	3249712	I really hope he gets up there and holds up his 40 and goes, This one's for my homies at OLR.
3252753	3253273	Whee!
3253333	3255954	What are you looking forward to seeing at the Wii press conference?
3255994	3262537	Is it just the date and the price to get the anticipation building so you can start taking pre-orders?
3263277	3265118	Are you hoping to see some new games or what?
3266138	3272782	I just want to know when I can get it and how much it is and I want to be able to run my GameStop and throw my $50 down and say, how's that?
3272822	3274463	I really, really hope so.
3292625	3294025	Ken Cooter, Huggie, and he's the doctor off of Crams.
3294045	3295366	He's the doctor from all the Crams.
3295386	3296326	I love you, sweetheart.
3296386	3296886	I'm really happy now.
3296906	3297807	I'm sorry.
3297827	3298827	I don't get to see her often, okay?
3298887	3299607	I'm allowed to be sentimental.
3299627	3300027	That's cute.
3322486	3324667	Thank you for letting me be sad about it on video.
3324707	3326468	That radio show is so gay.
3326688	3328269	I can see the iTunes review now.
3328429	3330010	Gay video game radio.
3330110	3330850	Fuck iTunes.
3332291	3333132	No, I love iTunes.
3333192	3334312	It's where we get a lot of downloads from.
3334732	3338935	Any last minute stories?
3339795	3341656	Actually, yes.
3341796	3342356	I like burritos.
3344177	3345178	Loki, please help.
3347455	3350138	GameTap is actually putting Sam and Max Hit the Road on its list of games.
3372054	3372595	Damn right.
3372635	3375237	I actually have a question for the chat.
3375357	3376879	But gay can mean happy, right?
3376939	3379161	So just, you know, there's something for everybody.
3380402	3380822	We're happy.
3381162	3382063	What did you have, Chris?
3382143	3382904	I just had a question.
3382964	3384105	Who's played Xena Saga 3?
3384766	3385306	And how good is it?
3386407	3387148	Okay, that's a question.
3387188	3387769	It's going to take a second.
3387829	3388449	It's going to take a minute.
3390911	3391312	Change of mind.
3391412	3392093	Loki, do you have anything else?
3392533	3393434	Yes.
3393734	3396817	For my birthday, people chipped in and got me surround sound.
3397389	3403715	So now I have 5.1 surround sound in my living room with my widescreen TV and the 360.
3404616	3405317	It's awesome.
3406038	3406578	It's awesome.
3406618	3407339	Is it pretty?
3407579	3408460	It's pretty.
3408480	3415927	It plays Saints Row and I can hear the prostitutes yelling behind me so then I turn around and go beat their ass.
3416508	3417049	It's awesome.
3417109	3418190	Is it awesome like a hot dog?
3418630	3419010	Yes.
3419671	3420272	Like a hot dog.
3421154	3423455	Nintendo Maniac 64 says my friend has played it.
3423535	3426017	Funnydale said I heard that game has a six-hour cutscene.
3426677	3427377	I don't know if that would work.
3428278	3429578	DMN says it blows ass.
3430779	3431079	Really?
3431459	3431759	Why?
3431779	3432920	Well, he may not be talking.
3433040	3435781	He may just be talking, responding to somebody else again.
3437943	3442445	Somebody may have asked him, you know, what do you think about, you know, colonoscopies?
3443425	3445346	He might have been responding to that question.
3445406	3448648	Ranma said if Reggie comes out with a 40, he better have cornrows.
3452172	3474561	Sephiroth 1215 says Xenosaga is $30 at Circuit City this week for those of you guys that like deals I already bought it I just haven't played it yet I actually was a moron and didn't get Xenosaga 2 when it came out so I have to order that and wait to play that or I can actually play Xenosaga 3 DMN is saying Xenosaga 3 is garbage is what?
3474801	3480724	garbage fuck you, it's blue hair I gotta have blue hair
3482210	3485831	Is it possible that the game might suck, even though the first two were good?
3486171	3488032	Well, again, I haven't played the first two.
3488112	3489072	I haven't played two.
3489593	3494814	I really like the first one, mainly because I like playing stuff with a storyline.
3495515	3500917	And I don't care if the storyline is bad, kind of, because I really like the art in three.
3502257	3504758	Do you like five-hour miniseries for cutscenes?
3504918	3506138	If so, it sounds like you'll love it.
3506579	3506979	Oh, yes.
3507939	3509360	I like a game that plays itself.
3509460	3509800	I do.
3510967	3513308	This is a movie that you interact with.
3513709	3515110	You press the A button once in a while.
3515130	3522554	By the way, with actual game news, Exo 6 is taking place in Barcelona on the 27th and 28th of September.
3523095	3523395	Okay.
3523675	3525676	I bet there's going to be big news out of that.
3526977	3532140	They're expected to announce new franchises from Bungie.
3533201	3533881	Some stuff for Halo 3.
3534022	3534562	Yeah, fun stuff.
3540549	3544071	I have one last little tidbit here that's being sent to private message in chat.
3544091	3549474	There's a rumor going around that a Wii tech demo of sorts is going to come with a Wii remote purchase.
3550034	3552315	That's just a rumor, but that might be interesting.
3552355	3553516	Some of that stuff you saw at E3.
3553536	3554096	That's cool.
3554156	3554997	I collect tech demos.
3555557	3558459	I actually have like five of the old PlayStation tech demos.
3559859	3566723	If you want to see something crazy, go back and look at the old tech demos on the PlayStation, and they look pretty damn good, even by today's standards.
3568894	3571435	See, DarkSakura can't say something nice about Sony once in a while.
3571595	3572436	It was a PlayStation.
3572556	3573076	Stop hating.
3573536	3576177	And remember, the PlayStation was born from the Super Nintendo.
3577097	3577978	In a way, yeah.
3578638	3579298	So, huh.
3580419	3584701	All right, boys and girls, that's going to bring this edition of Orange Lounge Radio to a close.
3585281	3587462	Thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening to us tonight.
3587502	3591483	We really appreciate the fact that you guys tune in to us and support independent radio.
3591503	3592324	You guys rock.
3593086	3595167	Now we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.
3595367	3597489	And we'll start off with Drew Nami.
3597529	3599430	Drew Nami, thank you for being here tonight, as always.
3600891	3602412	And what's your final thought for tonight?
3603352	3605113	No poo, thanks.
3605874	3607214	Chris, your final thought for tonight?
3607595	3609676	My final thought is I love you guys.
3609736	3611357	And I'm sorry for making this place so random.
3611837	3612678	No, we love you too.
3612718	3613258	Thank you for being here.
3613298	3613998	Random is fun.
3614639	3615980	Old school listeners especially love it.
3617360	3618461	Loki, your final thought?
3619482	3621743	I'm just going to take tomorrow off.
3622467	3624188	and hopefully we'll play some more games this week.
3624248	3625168	I want to take tomorrow off.
3625588	3626448	I want to take tomorrow off.
3629629	3630650	DarkSakura, your final thought.
3633811	3640873	I've had the best weekend ever and I owe it all to my bestest buddy right here.
3641993	3643154	Aww, I think I threw up in my mouth.
3643394	3643834	Shut up!
3643894	3644454	I'm just kidding.
3645374	3647575	My final thought is I want potato chips.
3649249	3649790	Are there any left?
3650590	3651250	I hate you.
3652371	3657833	We are starting a campaign to call them crisps and to call French fries chips.
3658414	3658774	I see.
3658814	3659874	Freedom fries?
3660174	3661415	No, they're chips.
3662416	3666257	I forgot to mention, and this is not that important, but it is news.
3667358	3674001	Fire and Mortar 2.81 came out for the PSP, which allows you to use memory sticks that are larger than 4 gigs.
3674061	3674561	Hurrah.
3676482	3677943	And I have one more final thought for you all.
3678973	3679133	What?
3679453	3680434	Reject false icons.
